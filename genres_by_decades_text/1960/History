Come for me!
You're gaining on it, Johnny.
Am I, father? Am I really?
Off you go now.
Run along and practice.
He'll make a good king.
He'll be ready.
That's the way.
Come on, my son!
Have you found religion,
Henry?
Will you look down from heaven and see who's sitting on your throne?
I must know before I die.
There's a legend of a king called
Lear, with whom I have a lot in common.
Both of us have kingdoms and three children we adore, and both of us are old, but there it ends.
He cuts his kingdom into bits.
I can't do that.
I've built an empire, and
I must know it's going to last.
All of Britain, half of France...
I'm the greatest power in a thousand years, and after me comes John.
I'm going to lose you,
Henry, aren't I?
Alais, in my time I've known... contessas, milkmaids, courtesans... and novices, whores, gypsies, jades... and little boys, but nowhere in God's western world have I found anyone to love but you.
And Rosamund?
- She's dead.
- And Eleanor.
The new Medusa, my good wife?
How is your queen?
Decaying, I suppose.
No, don't be jealous of the Gorgon.
She is not among the things I love.
How many husbands do you know who dungeon up their wives?
I haven't kept the great bitch in the keep for ten years out of passionate attachment.
- There's Captain Marshal.
William!
We will be holding
Christmas court at chinon.
We have asked the king of France to join us.
I want Richard there and Geoffrey.
Go find my boys and tell them.
Then go fetch the queen from Salisbury tower.
If the queen refuses?
Eleanor?
She wouldn't miss this for the world.
Richard.
Richard!
Hello, Richard.
Forward!
Forward!
Geoffrey?
Geoffrey.
Geoffrey!
Father wants to see me.
Your majesty.
There's to be a Christmas court.
Yes, madam.
Where?
At chinon.
Henry, what if, just for once,
I didn't do as I was told?
It's going to be a jungle of a day.
If I start growling now,
I'll never last.
You'll last.
You're like the rocks at stonehenge... nothing knocks you down.
In these rooms, Alais, on this
Christmas, I have all the enemies I need.
You have more than you think.
Are you one?
Has my willow turned to poison oak?
If I decided to be trouble,
Henry, how much trouble could I be?
Not much.
I could give away your plans.
You don't know what they are.
I know you want to disinherit
Richard. So does Eleanor.
She knows young Henry's dead.
The young king died in summer, and I haven't named an heir. She knows I want John... on the throne, and I know she wants
Richard... we are very frank about it.
Henry, I can't be your mistress if I'm married to your son.
Why can't you?
Johnny wouldn't mind.
I do not like your Johnny.
He's a good boy.
He's got pimples, and he smells of compost.
He's just 16!
He can't help the pimples.
He could have a bath!
It isn't such a dreadful thing to be queen of England.
Not all eyes will weep for you.
Will yours?
I don't know.
Very likely.
All I want is not to lose you.
Can't you hide me?
Can't I simply disappear?
You know you can't.
Your little brother Philip's king of France now, and he wants your wedding or your dowry back.
I only took you for your dowry. You were seven... two big knees and two big eyes, and that's all.
How was I to know?
Hey. What's the matter, lad? Nothing.
- Geoff!
- Johnny!
Is that for me?
I love Christmas.
What difference does my dowry make?
Let Philip have it back.
It isn't much. I can't.
The vexin is a little county, but it's vital to me. And I'm not.
It's been my luck to fall in love with landed women.
When I married Eleanor
I thought, "you lucky man.
"The richest woman in the world... she owns the Aquitaine, the greatest province in the continent, and beautiful as well."
She was, you know.
And you adored her.
Memory fails. There may have been an era when I did.
Let's have one strand askew. Nothing in life has any business being perfect.
If I say you and I are done, we're done.
If I say marry John, it's John.
I'll have you by me, and I'll use you as I like.
Ah, Christmas... warm and rosy time.
The hot wine steams, the yule log roars, and we're the fat that's in the fire.
She'll be here soon, you know. Who? Mother.
She still want you to be king? We are not as friendly as we used to be.
If I'm supposed to make a fuss and kiss her hairy cheek, I won't.
What you kiss, little prince, is up to you.
I'm father's favorite.
That's what counts.
You hardly know me, Johnny, so I beg you to believe my reputation.
I am a constant soldier, a sometime poet, and I will be king.
Just you remember... father loves me best.
Why John? John doesn't care for you at all.
We love each other deeply. None of them has any love for you.
Because we fight?
Tell me all three want the crown. I'll tell you it's a feeble prince that doesn't.
They may snap at me and plot, and that makes them the kind of sons I want.
I've snapped and plotted all my life.
There's no other way to be a king, alive and 50 all at once.
I'm going to fight for you.
Oh, fine.
How was your crossing?
Did the channel part for you?
It went flat when I told it to.
I didn't think to ask for more.
How dear of you to let me out of jail. It's only for the holidays.
Like school, you keep me young.
Here's gentle Alais.
No, greet me as you used to.
Fragile I am not.
Affection is a pressure
I can bear.
Oh, but I do have handsome children.
John, you're so clean and neat.
Henry takes good care of you.
And Richard.
Don't look sullen, dear. It makes your eyes go small and piggy... and your chin look weak.
Geoffrey.
Is Philip here yet?
Not yet.
Let's hope he's grown up like his father...
Simon pure and Simon simple... good, good, Louis.
If I had managed sons for him instead of all those little girls,
I'd still be stuck with being queen of France, and we should not have known each other.
Such, my angels, is the role of sex in history.
Thatwill be Philip.
Where's Henry?
Upstairs with the family whore.
That's a mean and tawdry way to talk about your fiancee.
My fiancee.
Whosever fiancee.
I brought her up, and she is dear to me and gentle.
He still plans to make John king. Of course he does.
My, what a greedy little trinity you are... king, king, king.
Two of you must learn to live with disappointment. Ah, but which two?
Let's deny them all and live forever.
Tusk to tusk through all eternity.
Ah, my boys.
The king of France and I will shortly have a tactile conversation, like two surgeons looking for a lump.
We'll state positions, and I'll make the first of many offers. He'll refuse it, naturally.
I'll make a better one, and so on through the holidays until I win.
For the duration of this joyous ritual you will give to your father your support.
- My lord!
- Your grace!
Welcome to chinon.
Ah, that's better.
I was told you were impressive for a boy of 17.
- I'm Eleanor, who might have been your mother.
- queen Eleanor.
All the others here you know.
I gather you're disturbed about your sister and her dowry.
Sixteen years ago you made a treaty with us.
- It is time its terms were executed.
- I should think so.
Our position comes to this:
That you will either hold the marriage or return the vexin.
Alais marries Richard, or we'll have the county back at once.
That's clear, concise and well presented.
My position... well, frankly, Philip, it's a tangle.
Two years ago, the queen and I... for reasons passing understanding... gave the Aquitaine to Richard.
That makes Richard very powerful.
How can I give him Alais too?
The man she marries has you for an ally.
It's their wedding or the vexin back.
Those are the terms you made with Louis.
True, but academic, lad.
The vexin's mine.
By what authority? It's got my troops all over it. That makes it mine.
Now, hear me, boy.
I am a king. I am no man's boy. A king?
Because you put your ass on purple cushions?
- Sir.
- Philip.
You haven't got the feel of this at all, lad.
Use all your voices.
When I bellow, bellow back.
I'll mark that down.
This too:
We are the world in small.
A nation is a human thing. It does what we do, for our reasons.
Surely if we're civilized, we can put away the knives.
We can make peace.
We have it in our hands.
I've tutors of my own.
Will that be all? Oh, think.
You came here for a reason. Don't you want to ask me if I've got an offer?
Have you got an offer? Not yet, but I'll think of one.
Oh, by the way, you're better at this than I thought you'd be.
I wasn't sure you'd noticed.
Well, what shall we hang... the holly or each other?
Would you say, father, that I have the makings of a king? A splendid king.
And would you expect me, father, to give up without a fight?
Of course you'll fight.
I raised you to.
I don't care what you offer Philip,
I don't care what plans you make.
I'll have the Aquitaine and Alais and the crown.
I'll not give up one to get the other.
I won't trade off Alais or the
Aquitaine to that walking pustule!
No, your loving son will not.
Did you hear what he called me? Clearly, dear.
Now, run along. It's nearly dinnertime.
I only do what father tells me.
Go and eat.
Did I say something wrong?
I'm always saying something wrong. And don't pout.
I'm not pouting. And stand up straight!
How often do I have to tell you?
And that's to be the king.
And I'm to be his chancellor.
Has he told you?
John will rule the country while I run it, that is to say, he gets to spend the taxes that I raise.
How nice for you. It's not as nice as being king.
We've made you duke of brittany. Is that so little?
No one ever thinks of crown and mentions Geoff. Why is that?
Isn't being chancellor power enough?
It's not the power I feel deprived of. It's the mention I miss.
There's no affection for me here.
You wouldn't think
I'd want that, would you?
Henry?
Hmm?
I have a confession.
Yeah?
- I don't much like our children.
Only you... the child I raised but didn't bear. You never cared for me.
I did and do, believe me.
Henry's bed is Henry's province.
He can people it with sheep for all I care, which, on occasion, he has done.
Rosamund's been dead for seven years.
Two months and 18 days.
I never liked her much.
- You count the days?
- I made the numbers up.
He found miss clifford in the mists of wales... and brought her home for closer observation.
Liking what he found, he scrutinized her many years.
He loved her deeply, and she, him. And yet, my dear, when Henry had to choose between his lady and my lands... there is no sport in hurting me. It's so easy.
After all the years of loving care, do you think I could bring myself to hurt you?
Eleanor, with both hands tied behind you.
She is lovely, isn't she?
Yes, very.
Who could I have chosen to love... to gall you more?
There's no one.
Time hasn't done a thing but wrinkle you.
It hasn't even done that. I've borne six girls, five boys... and 31 connubial years of you.
How am I possible? There are moments when I miss you.
Many? That's my wooly sheepdog. Do you doubt it?
So, wee Johnny gets the crown.
I've heard it rumored, but I don't believe it.
Losing Alais will be hard, for you do love her.
It's an old man's last attachment, nothing more.
How hard do you find living in your castle?
It was difficult in the beginning, but that's past.
I find I've seen the world enough.
I'll never let you loose.
You led too many civil wars against me.
And I damn near won the last one.
Still, as long as I get trotted out... for Christmas courts and state occasions now and then... for I do like to see you... it's enough.
I'm famished.
Let's go in to dinner.
Arm in arm.
And hand in hand.
You're still a marvel of a man.
And you're my lady.
It's an odd thing, Eleanor.
I've fought and bargained all these years... as if the only thing I had to live for was what happened after I was dead.
I've something else to live for now.
I've blundered onto peace.
On Christmas eve.
Since Louis died, while Philip grew, I've had no France to fight.
In that lull, I've found how good it is to write a law... or make a tax more fair or sit in judgment to decide... which peasant gets a cow.
I tell you, there is nothing more important in the world.
Now the french boy's big enough, and I'm sick of war.
Do you still need the vexin, Henry?
It's as vital as it ever was. My troops there are one day away from paris.
That's a march of 20 miles.
I must keep it.
Henry, dear, if Alais does not marry Richard,
I will see you lose the vexin.
Well, I thought you'd never say it.
I can do it.
You can try.
We have a pack of barons we should look the loving couple for.
Can you read love in that?
And permanent affection.
My Richard is the next king, not your John.
I know you, Henry. I know every twist and bend you've got, and I'll be waiting round each corner for you.
Do you truly care who's king?
I care because you care so much.
Don't fight me, Eleanor. What would you have me do... give out, give up, give in?
Give me a little peace.
A little?
Why so modest? How about eternal peace? Now, there's a thought.
If you oppose me,
I'll strike you any way I can.
Henry?
Madam?
Did you ever love me?
No.
Good. That will make this pleasanter.
Well, I've come.
I'm here.
What was it you wanted?
Just to talk.
We haven't been alone, the two of us, in... how long is it, lamb... two years?
You look fit.
War agrees with you.
I keep informed. I follow all your slaughters from a distance.
Do sit down.
Is this an audience, a good-night hug with kisses or an ambush?
Let's hope it's a reunion.
Must you look so stern?
I sent for you to say
I want your love again, but I can't say it to a face like that.
My love, of all things.
What would you want it for?
Why, for itself. What other purpose could I have?
You will tell me when you're ready to.
I scheme a lot, I know.
I plot and plan.
That's how a queen in prison spends her time.
But there is more to me than that.
Can't I say I love a son and be believed?
If I were you,
I'd try another tack.
I've no dammed up floods of passion for you. There's no chance I'll overflow.
You're a dull boy, dull as plainsong.
La-la-la, forever on one note.
I gave the church up out of boredom. I can do as much for you.
You'll never give me up, not while I hold the Aquitaine.
You think I'm motivated by love of hills and dales? I think you want it back.
You're so deceitful, you can't ask for water when you're thirsty.
We could tangle spiders in the webs you weave.
If I'm so devious, why don't you go?
Don't stand there qulvering in limbo.
Love me, little lamb, or leave me.
Leave you, madam?
With pure joy.
Departure's a simple act. You put the left foot down, and then the right.
Mother! Hush, dear. Mother's fighting.
Father's finished working out the treaty terms.
How nice.
Where is your father?
Ah, there you are.
Well, have you put the terms to Philip?
Not yet, but we're shortly granting him an audience. I hope you'll all attend.
Are we to know the terms, or would you rather tease us?
Not at all. The terms are... what are you giving to Philip, what of mine?
Whatever you've got goes to me. And what's the nothing Geoffrey gets?
My God, boys, you can't all three be king.
All three of us can try.
That's pointless now.
I want you to succeed me,
Richard.
Alais and the crown...
I give you both.
I've no sense of humor.
If I did, I'd laugh.
- I mean to do it.
- What about me?
I'm your favorite.
I'm the one you love.
I'm sorry, John.
I can't help myself.
Could you keep anything I gave you?
Could you beat him in the field?
You could.
John, I won't be there.
I'm losing too.
All my dreams for you are lost.
You've led me on.
I never meant to.
You're a failure as a father.
You know that? I'm sorry, Johnny.
Not yet, but I'll do something terrible, and you'll be sorry then.
Did you rehearse all this, or are you improvising?
Good God, woman, face the facts.
Which ones?
We have so many.
Power is the only fact.
How could I keep him from the throne?
He'd only take it if I didn't give it to him.
No, you'd make me fight for it.
I know you. You'd never give me anything. True, and I haven't.
You get Alais and the kingdom, but I get the thing I want most:
If you're king, England stays intact. I get that.
It's all yours now... the crown, the girl, the whole black business.
Isn't that enough?
I don't know who's to be congratulated.
Kings, Queens, knights everywhere you look, and I'm the only pawn.
I haven't got a thing to lose.
That makes me dangerous.
- Poor child.
- Poor John.
Who says, "poor John"?
Don't everybody sob at once.
My God, if I went up in flames, there's not a living soul... who'd pee on me to put the fire out.
Let's strike a flint and see.
You're everything a little brother dreams of, you know that?
- I used to dream about you all the time.
- Ah, Johnny.
I'll show you, Eleanor.
I've not lost yet.
Well, mummy, if you want me, here I am.
John's lost his chancellor, has he? And you've gained one.
It's a bitter thing your mummy has to say.
She doesn't trust me. You must know Henry isn't through with John.
He'll keep the vexin till the moon goes blue from cold.
And as for Richard's wedding day... we'll see the second coming first.
The needlework alone can last for years.
I know.
You know I know.
I know you know I know.
We know Henry knows, and Henry knows we know it.
We're a knowledgeable family.
Will Richard take me for his chancellor or won't he?
Why are you dropping John?
Because you're going to win. You will, with me to help you. I haven't yet.
I can handle John. He'll swallow anything I tell him.
I'll take him by the hand and walk him into the trap you set.
You're good.
You're first class, Geoff.
You'd sell John out to me, or me to John, or... you can tell me... have you found some way of selling everyone to everybody?
Not yet, mummy, but I'm working on it.
I don't care who's king, but you and Henry do.
I want to watch the two of you go picnicking on one another.
You have a gift for hating.
You're the expert.
You should know.
Dear lord.
You've loved me all these years.
Oh, God forgive me. I've upset the queen. We need you. Help us.
What... and miss the fun of selling you?
Be Richard's chancellor.
Rot.
Well, that's how deals are made.
We've got him if we want him.
He'll sell us all, you know, but only if he thinks we think he won't.
Why did I have to have such clever children?
What's the matter, Richard? Nothing.
It's a heavy thing, your nothing.
When I write or send for you or speak or reach, your nothings come, like stones.
Don't play a scene with me.
I wouldn't if I could.
I'm simpler than I used to be.
I had, at one time, many appetites.
I wanted poetry and power and the young men who create them both.
I even wanted Henry, too, in those days.
Now I've only one desire left... to see you king.
The only thing you want to see is father's vitals on a bed of lettuce.
You don't care who wins, as long as Henry loses. You'd do anything.
You are Medea to the teeth, only this is one son you won't use for vengeance against your husband.
How my captivity has changed you.
Henry meant to hurt me.
He's hacked you up instead.
Men coveted this talon once.
Henry was 18 when we met, and I was queen of France.
He came down from the north to
Paris with a mind like Aristotle's... and a form like mortal sin.
We shattered the commandments on the spot.
I spent three months annulling
Louis, then in may, in spring, not far from here, we married... young count Henry and his countess.
But in three years' time I was his queen, and he was king of England.
Done at 21... five years your junior, general.
I can count. There was no Thomas
Beckett then, or Rosamund... no rivals, only me.
And then young Henry came, and you... and all the other blossoms in my garden.
Yes. Had I been sterile, darling, I'd be happier today.
Is that designed to hurt me?
What a waste.
I've fought with Henry over who comes next, whose dawn it is... and which son gets the sunset, and we'll never live to see it.
Look at you.
I loved you more than Henry, and it's cost me everything.
What do you want?
I want us back the way we were. No, that's not it.
All right, then.
I want the Aquitaine.
That's the mother I remember.
We can win. I can get you Alais.
I can make the marriage happen, but
I've got to have the Aquitaine to do it.
I must have it back. It's mine, and I'll never give it up.
Shall I write my will,
"to Richard... everything"?
Would you believe me then?
Where's paper? Paper burns.
I love you.
You love nothing.
You're incomplete. The human parts of you are missing.
You're as dead as you are deadly.
Don't leave me.
You were lovely once.
I've seen the pictures.
Don't you remember how you loved me?
We were always hand in hand.
Here's how it felt.
As hot and coarse as that?
This won't burn.
I'll scratch a will on this.
"To Richard... everything."
Mother!
Remember how I taught you numbers... and the lute and poetry?
See? You do remember.
I taught you dancing, too, and languages... and all the music I knew and how to love what's beautiful.
The sun was warmer then, and we were every day together.
William, tell the french king
I'll see him in the parlor.
Yes, my lord.
In half an hour.
Half an hour. Good.
Of course, you know there's not a word of truth to Henry's terms.
If that's a warning, thank you.
What if it's an offer?
"What if" is a game for scholars.
What if angels sat on pinheads?
What if I were king?
It's your game, Geoff.
You play it.
John.
I made this for father.
All the pieces work.
It took months. I'm not a fool.
I know. Now, here's my plan.
I read three languages.
I've studied law.
What plan?
We've got to make a deal with Philip. Why?
Because you're out, and Richard's in. And what kind of deal?
A war. If we three join and fight now, we can finish Richard off.
You mean destroy him?
Hmm.
And mother too?
And mother too.
Now, do we do it? Is it on? I've got to think.
You haven't time.
We are extra princes now.
You know where extra princes go?
Down.
Well, does John want a war or doesn't he?
Do you? If John asks for your soldiers, will he get them?
If John wants a war, he's got one.
John, you hear that?
I'm still thinking.
Let me help. It's either
Richard on the throne or you.
Do you think we'd win?
I know it.
Henry!
But you don't understand. I would appreciate a little qulet confidence.
I've enough nits picking at me.
But you've promised me to Richard!
Good God, you don't think I meant it?
So that whole scene, all you said to John... you think I'd ever give him up when I've mothered him and fathered him and babied him?
He's all I've got! How often do you people have to hear it... every supper?
Should we start the soup with who we love and who we don't?
I think you like passing me from hand to hand.
What am I to you... a collection plate?
Or am I all you've got, like John?
I've got to get the Aquitaine for John.
- I talk people, and you answer back in provinces!
- They get mixed up.
What's the Aquitaine to Eleanor? It's not a province. It's a way to torture me.
That's why she spent the evening wooing Richard, wheezing on the coals.
She'll squeeze it out of him. My
God, I'd have loved to eavesdrop.
"I taught you prancing, lamb, and lute and flute..."
That's marvelous.
It's absolutely me.
I thought as long as I was coming down, I'd bring them.
Whatever are you giving me?
You're such a child.
You always ask.
"To Henry."
Heavy.
It's my tombstone!
Eleanor, you spoil me.
I never could deny you anything.
Don't go. It nettles her to see how much I need you.
You need me, Henry, like a tailor needs a tinker's dam.
Oh, I know that look.
He's going to say he loves me.
Like my life.
I talk that way to keep her spirits up.
Well, how'd you do with
Richard? Did you break his heart?
You think he ought to give me back the Aquitaine?
I can't see why he shouldn't. After all, I've promised him the throne.
The boy keeps wondering if your promises are any good.
There's no sense asking if the air's good when there's nothing else to breathe.
Exactly what I told him.
Have you got it?
Will he give it back?
No Aquitaine for John.
I have to give him something.
Isn't some agreement possible?
Love, in a world where carpenters get resurrected, anything is possible.
You bore him, damn it.
He's your son!
Oh, heavens, yes.
280 days I bore him.
I recall them all.
You'd only just found Rosamund.
Why her so damn particularly?
I've found other women.
Countless others.
What's your count?
Let's have a tally of the bedspreads you've spread out on.
Thomas Beckett's.
That's a lie.
I know.
You still care what I do.
I want the Aquitaine for John!
I want it, and I'll have it.
Is that menace you're conveying? Is it to be torture?
Will you boil me or stretch me... which? Or am I to be perforated?
I have the documents, and you will sign.
How will you force me to... threats?
"Sign or I refuse to feed you."
Tears? "Oh, sign before my heart goes crack."
I'm like the earth, old man... there isn't any way around me.
I adore you.
Save your aching arches.
That road's closed.
I have an offer for you, my dear.
A deal? A deal?
I give the richest province on the continent to John for what?
You tell me, mastermind, for what.
Your freedom.
Oh.
Once Johnny gets the Aquitaine, you're free. I'll let you out.
Think: On the loose in london, winters in provence, impromptu trips to visit Richard anywhere he's killing people... all that for a signature.
- You're good.
- I thought it might appeal. You always fancied traveling.
Yes.
I even made poor Louis take me on crusade.
How's that for blasphemy?
I dressed my maids as amazons and rode bare-breasted halfway to damascus.
Louls had a seizure, and I damn near died of windburn, but the troops were dazzled.
Henry, I'm against the wall.
To be a prisoner... to be bricked in... when you've known the world...
I'll never know how I survived.
These ten years, Henry, have been unimaginable.
And now, you offer me the only thing I want... if I give up... the only thing I treasure.
Sign the paper, and we'll break the happy news.
The queen is free, John gets the
Aquitaine, and Richard marries Alais.
Yes, let's have it done.
I'll sign.
On one condition.
Name it.
Have the wedding now.
What's that?
Why, I've surprised you.
Surely it's not sudden.
They've been marching down the aisle for 16 years, and that's a long walk.
John can be best man.
That's a laugh.
And you can give the bride away. I want to watch you do it.
Alais...
I can live without her.
And I thought you loved her. So I do.
Thank God. You frightened me.
I was afraid this wouldn't hurt.
What a tragedy you are.
I wonder... do you ever wonder... if I slept with your father?
My father?
It's a lie.
But there are rumors.
Don't you ever wonder?
Is it rich, despising me? Is it rewarding? No.
Then stop!
How?
It's what I live for.
I'll show you.
By christ, I will.
I'll do it.
Where's a priest?
Somebody dig me up a priest!
You!
Fetch me a bishop!
Get old Durham.
He's just down the hall.
Ask him to meet us in the chapel. John, Richard, Geoffrey!
What's wrong? What's happened?
Richard's getting married.
Getting married? Now?
He's getting married now?
I never cease to marvel at the qulckness of your mind.
You can't hurt me, you bag of bile.
But you can, father.
Why? Because I say so.
My lord, the bishop's waiting in the chapel. Good. Let's get this over with.
You'll make a lovely bride.
I wonder if I'll cry.
You sound as if you think it's going to happen. I do.
He's only plotting. Can't you tell when Henry's plotting?
Not this time.
He'll never give me up.
You think I won't?
Because you told me so.
You're not my helen. I won't fight a war to save a face. We're done.
I don't believe you!
Wait ten minutes!
Please! Richard, Richard, we're not... honestly, we're not!
Please!
We love each other.
Come on! It's lunacy!
I won't do it! I won't!
- Lunacy! Let me go, Henry. Richard, no!
- Come on!
I won't say the words!
Not one of them!
It makes no sense!
Why give me up?
What do you get?
What are you gaining?
Why, the Aquitaine, of course.
What's that again?
Your mother gets her freedom, and I get the Aquitaine.
That is the proposition, isn't it? You did agree.
Of course she did. I knew it. It was all pretense. I believed it all.
I meant it all. No wedding.
There'll be no wedding.
But, my boy, look.
Durham's waiting.
Marry her, for my sake. It isn't much to ask. Never!
But I promised it to Philip.
Think of my position.
Damn the wedding and to hell with your position. You don't dare defy me.
Don't I?
You're the king of France, for
God's sake. Speak up. Do something.
Make a threat. Come on, frighten me. Am I? Dunce!
He never meant to have the wedding.
Come again. You're good at rage. I like the way you play it.
Boy, don't ever call a king a liar to his face.
I'm not a boy... to you or anyone!
Boy, you came here asking for a wedding or the vexin back.
By God, you don't get either. It's no to both. You have a pact with France!
Then damn the pact and damn France.
She never marries, not while I'm alive.
Your life and never are two different times.
Not on my clock, boy!
Listen to the lion!
Come on, frighten me. Don't spoil it,
Richard. Take it like a good sport.
How's your bad leg?
Better, thank you.
Your bad back? You're getting old. You'll have me once too often.
When? I'm 50 now. My God, boy, I'm the oldest man I know.
I've got a decade on the pope.
What's it to be? The broadsword when I'm 85?
I'm not a second son now. Your
Henry's lies in the vault, you know.
I know.
I've seen him there.
I'll have the crown. You'll have what daddy gives you.
I am next in line!
To nothing!
Then we'll only have the broadswords now. This minute?
No, on the battlefield!
So we're at war?
Yes, we're at war. I have 2,000 men at poitiers. Can they hear you?
Call and see who answers. You're as close to poitiers as you'll get.
You don't dare hold me prisoner. Until we're all agreed John comes next, I can and will.
You're a king's son, so I treat you with respect. You have the freedom of the castle.
The castle doesn't stand that holds me. Post your guards.
My God, I'm king again.
Fantastic.
Are you happy for me, Geoff?
I'm happy for us both.
You played it nicely.
You were good.
Yes, I was.
I fooled you, didn't I?
Oh, God, but I do love being king.
Well, Henry, liege and lord, what happens now?
I've no idea.
I know I'm winning, and I know I'll win, but what the next move is... you were scared, weren't you?
No.
I think you were.
I was. You mustn't play with feelings, Henry. Not with mine.
It wasn't possible to lose you.
I must hold you dearer than I thought.
You've got your enigmatic face on. What's your mood, I wonder?
Pure delight.
I'm locked up with my sons.
What mother does not dream of that?
One thing.
Yes?
May I watch you kiss her?
Can't you ever stop?
I watch you every night.
I conjure it before I sleep.
Leave it there.
My curiosity is intellectual.
I want to see how accurate I am.
Forget the dragon in the doorway. Come.
Believe I love you, for I do.
Believe I'm yours forever, for I am.
Believe in my contentment and the joy you give me.
And believe... you want more?
I'm an old man in an empty place.
Be with me.
How beautiful you make me.
What might solomon have sung had he seen this.
I can't.
I'd turn to salt.
I've lost again.
I'm done for this time.
Well, there'll be other Christmases.
I'd hang you from the nipples, but you'd shock the children.
They kissed sweetly, didn't they?
I'll have him next time.
I can wait.
Ah, there you are!
My comfort and my company.
We're locked in for another year.
Four seasons more.
What a desolation.
What a life's work.
Is it too much?
Be sure to squlnt as you approach.
You may be blinded by my beauty.
Merry Christmas.
Is that why you're here... to tell me that?
I thought you might be lonely.
Here, chancellor.
Try it on for size.
It's puzzling.
I remember my third birthday.
Not just pictures of the garden or the gifts, but who did what to whom and how it felt.
My memory stretches that far back, but never once can I remember... anything from you or father warmer than indifference.
Why is that?
I don't know.
That was not an easy question from me, and I don't deserve and easy answer.
There are times I think we loved none of our children.
Still too easy, don't you think?
I'm weary, and you want a simple answer, and I haven't one.
I'm so sick of all of you.
I thought I'd come and gloat a little.
Mother's tired. Come stick pins tomorrow morning.
I'll be more responsive then.
It's no fun goading anyone tonight. Bastard's boxed us up.
What's that, dear? We're his prisoners, if that interests you.
Why should it?
I'm his prisoner anyway?
It was... correct me if I'm wrong... but it was my impression that you wanted Henry's throne for me.
We can't win, Richard.
We've lost it this time.
You think I'm finished, do you? So I do.
I've suffered more defeats than you have teeth.
I know one when it happens to me.
Take your wormwood like a good boy. Swallow it and go to bed.
I will be king. So you will, but not this year!
Oh, leave it, Richard!
Let it go for now.
I can't.
It's not so hard.
Try saying after me:
John wins, I lose.
And what if John died?
You wouldn't dare! A knife. Why wouldn't I?
He's got a knife! Of course he has a knife. He always has a knife.
We all have knives. It's
1183, and we're barbarians.
How clear we make it. Oh, my piglets, we are the origins of war.
Not history's forces, nor the times, nor justice, nor the lack of it, nor causes, nor religions, nor ideas, nor kinds of government, nor any other thing.
Weare the killers.
Webreed wars.
We carry it, like syphilis, inside.
Dead bodies rot in field and stream because the living ones are rotten.
For the love of God, can't we love one another just a little?
That's how peace begins.
We have so much to love each other for.
We have such possibilities, my children.
We could change the world.
And while we hugged each other, what would Philip do?
Oh, good God, Philip!
We're supposed to start a war. If father finds out, I'll be rulned.
Steady, John. Don't panic.
Some adviser you are.
Don't do anything without me. Let me handle it. He's made a pact with Philip.
You advised John into making war. That fearless boy... he's disinherited himself.
When Henry finds out... when
I tell him what John's done...
I need a little time. Can you keep
John from Philip till I say so?
Anything you say. Richard, I want you out of here before this breaks.
And that means Philip.
Go to him, be desperate.
Promise anything... the vexin, brittany.
Once you're free and John is out of favor, we'll make further plans.
You see Philip. You're the diplomat.
You see him, you talk to him.
You're a friend.
You know him, I don't.
And Richard!
Promise anything.
I've got the old boy this time.
The damn fool thinks he loves John. He believes it.
That's where the knife goes in... knives.
Knives.
Where is that mirror? I'm Eleanor, and I can look at anything.
My, what a lovely girl.
How could her king have left her?
Philip?
Philip!
It's working out. By morning,
I can be the chosen son.
The crown can come to me. Are you still with me? We'll have to fight them all.
They'll band together once this happens. Have I got your word?
Do I have yours? All England's land in France if I support you?
Are we allies then?
We were born to be.
I should say something solemn, but I haven't the time.
I'm off to father with news that
John's a traitor. After that... you stink! You know that?
You're a stinker, and you stink.
I'll kill you!
Ah!
Lump.
If you're a prince, there's hope for every ape in africa.
I had you saved. I wasn't on my way to father, but he was.
He would have gone to Henry and betrayed you. Look, it's in his face.
It's true. I don't know who my friends are.
Philip?
May we? That's what tapestries are for.
I'll never learn.
I'll ruln everything.
Richard?
Hello, Richard.
You're halfway to bed. I'll wait for morning. Come in.
Mother sent me.
Come in anyway.
Our alchemists have stumbled on the art of boiling burgundy.
It turns to steam, and when it cools, we call it brandywine.
I'm Henry's prisoner.
You find that charming?
No. Then why the charming smile?
I thought,
I can't think why, of when you were in paris last.
Can it be two whole years ago? It can. I need an army.
It'll take the cold away.
I must have soldiers.
Have I aged?
Do I seem older to you?
They've been two fierce years. I've studied, and I've trained to be a king.
I'll have your answer... yes or no? You'll have it when I give it.
You see?
I've changed.
I'm not the boy you taught to hunt two years ago. Remember?
Racing after boar, you flying first, me scrambling after, all day into dusk.
Don't go. I must know. Will you help me?
Sit and we'll discuss it.
You never write.
To anyone.
Why should I make you king of England?
Aren't I better off with John or Geoffrey?
Why have you to fight when I could have the cretin or the fiend?
Would we fight? We're fighting now. Good night.
You're still a boy.
In some ways.
Which way did you have in mind?
You haven't asked how much your help is worth. You'll tell me.
You can have the vexin back.
And what else?
All of brittany. Does that matter? That's Geoffrey's.
Possibly to Geoffrey. And what else? That's all your help is worth.
And in return, what do you want from me?
Two thousand soldiers.
- And what else?
- Five hundred knights on horse.
- And what else?
- Arms and siege equlpment.
- And what else?
- I never wrote because I thought you'd never answer.
You got married.
Does that make a difference? Doesn't it?
I've spent two years on every street in hell.
That's odd.
I never saw you there.
You haven't said you loved me.
When the time comes.
Shh.
It's not too late at night?
I'd hoped you'd come.
Good!
We couldn't leave negotiations where they were.
Ah!
I keep looking for your father in you. He's not there.
I'll miss him.
Has Richard or the queen been here to see you?
Does it matter? If they haven't yet, they will.
I want to reach a settlement. I left you with too little earlier.
Yes.
Nothing is too little.
I'm sorry you're not fonder of me, lad.
Your father always said,
"be fond of stronger men."
No wonder he loved everyone.
I've come to you to offer peace.
Piss on your peace.
Your father would have wept.
My father was a weeper.
Fight me, and you'll lose.
I can't lose, Henry.
I have time.
Why, just look at you.
Great heavy arms. But each year they get a little heavier.
The sand goes pit-pat in the glass.
I'm in no hurry, Henry.
I've got time.
Suppose I hurry things along. Suppose I say that England is at war with France.
Then France surrenders. I don't have to fight to win.
Take all you want... this county, that one. You won't keep it long.
What kind of courage have you got?
The tidal kind... it comes and goes.
By God, I'd love to turn you loose on Eleanor. More brandywine?
You recognize it? They were boiling it in ireland before the snakes left.
Well, things look a little bleak for Henry, don't they?
You'll say yes to Richard when he comes... arms, soldiers, anything he asks.
I'd be foolish not to.
Yeah.
And withdraw it all before the battle ever started. Wouldn't you, in my place?
Why fight Henry when his sons will do it for you?
Yes, exactly.
- You've got promise, lad. That's first-class thinking. - Thank you, sir.
Good night. Good night? You're going? We haven't settled anything.
We open Christmas presents at noon.
Till then. You can't be finished with me.
Oh, but I am. It's been most satisfactory. What's so satisfactory?
Winning is. I did just win. Surely you noticed.
Not a thing. You haven't won a damn thing.
Hmm.
I found out the way your mind works and the kind of man you are.
I know your plans and expectations.
You've burbled every bit of strategy you've got.
I know exactly what you will do and exactly what you won't.
And I've told you exactly nothing!
To these aged eyes, boy, that's what winning looks like! Dormez bien.
You... you made my father nothing.
You were always better.
You bullied him, you bellied with his wife, you beat him down in every war, you twisted every treaty, you played mock the monk, and then you made him love you for it.
I was there.
His last words went to you.
He was a loving man, and you've learned nothing of it.
I learned how much fathers live in sons.
A king like you has policy prepared on everything.
What's the official line on sodomy?
How stands the crown on boys who do with boys?
Richard finds his way into so many legends.
Let's hear yours and see how it compares.
He found me first when I was 15.
We were hunting.
It was nearly dark.
My horse fell,
I was thrown.
I woke to Richard touching me.
He asked me if I loved him.
"Philip, do you love me?"
And I told him, "yes."
Do you know why
I told him yes?
So that one day I could tell you all about it.
You cannot imagine what that "yes" cost.
Imagine snuggling to a chancred whore... and bending back your lips into something like a smile, saying,
"yes,
"I love you,
"and I find you... beautiful."
I don't know how I did it.
- No! It wasn't like that!
- But it was.
You loved me.
Never.
Get out. Please.
I don't want you here.
It's no great pleasure to be here.
So the royal corkscrew finds me twisted, does he?
I'll go tell your mother. She'll be pleased. She knows. She sent me.
How completely hers you are.
You've had four sons.
Who do you claim?
Not Henry.
Not my buried brother.
Not that monument to muck, that epic idiot.
Why him? Why always him and never me?
He was the eldest.
He came first.
Christ, Henry, is that all?
You went with Eleanor.
You never called me.
You never said my name.
I'd have walked. I'd have crawled. I'd have done anything.
It's not my fault.
I won't be blamed.
I only wanted you.
No, my crown. You want my kingdom. You keep your kingdom.
That I will.
I hope it kills you.
Thank God I have another son.
Thank God for John.
And who shall we thank for
Geoffrey? You don't think much of me.
"Much"? I don't think of you at all.
Nurse used to say
I had your hands.
I might have had more of you.
Try seeing me.
I haven't Richard's military skill, but he was here betraying you, not I.
I haven't John's... God knows what you see in John... and he's betrayed you too.
You think I'd ever make you king?
You'll make me king because I'm all you've got.
I was to be his chancellor.
Ask him why. I've heard enough.
For moving John to treason.
I don't doubt he offered,
I don't doubt you tried, and I don't doubt
John loves me.
Like a glutton loves his lunch.
You turd.
Well, John?
It isn't what you think.
What do I think?
What Geoffrey said. I wouldn't plot against you, ever.
I know.
You're a good boy.
Can I go now, please? It's late. I ought to be in bed.
Couldn't you wait? Couldn't you trust me? It was all yours.
Couldn't you believe that?
Will you listen to the grief?
Who do you think I built this kingdom for? Me!
Daddy did it all for me.
When can I have it, daddy?
Not until we bury you?
- I loved you.
- You're a cold and bloody bastard, you are.
And you don't love anything.
I'm it.
I'm all that's left.
Here, father.
Here I am.
My life, when it is written, will read better than it lived.
Henry fitz-empress, first plantagenet, a king at 21, the ablest soldier of an able time.
He led men well, he cared for justice when he could... and ruled, for 30 years, a state as great as charlemagne's.
He married out of love a woman out of legend.
Not in alexandria or rome or camelot has there been such a queen.
She bore him many children, but no sons.
King Henry had no sons.
He had three whiskered things, but he disowned them.
You're not mine!
We're not connected!
I deny you!
None of you will get my kingdom.
I leave you nothing!
And I wish you plague! May all your children breech and die!
My boys are gone.
I've lost my boys.
You dare to damn me, do you?
Well, I'll damn you back.
Goddamn you!
My boys are gone.
I've lost my boys.
Oh, jesus.
All my boys.
Henry?
The Christmas wine is in the pot
The Christmas coals are red
I'll spend my day the lover's way
Unwrapping all my gifts
In bed
The Christmas mass
Is over now
The Christmas prayers are done
No one else is caroling.
It might as well be lent.
When I was little, Christmas was a time of great confusion to me.
The holy land had two kings...
God and uncle raymond.
I never knew whose birthday we were celebrating.
Henry isn't here. Good, we can talk behind his back.
What happened?
Don't you know?
There was a scene with beds and tapestries, and many things got said.
Spiced wine.
I'd forgotten Henry liked it.
May I stay?
It's your room just as much as mine. We're both in residence.
Packed in like the poor, three to a bed.
Did you love Henry... ever?
Ever? Back before the flood?
As long ago as rosamund.
Ah, that's prehistory, lamb. There are no written records or survivors.
There are pictures. She was prettier than you. Oh, much.
Her eyes, in certain light, were violet, and all her teeth were even.
That's a rare, fair feature... even teeth.
She smiled to excess, but she chewed with real distinction.
And you hate her even now.
No, but I did.
He put her in my place, you see, and that was very hard.
Like you, she headed Henry's table. That's my chair.
And so you had her poisoned.
No, I never poisoned rosamund.
Oh, I prayed for her to drop... and smiled a little when she did.
Why aren't you happy?
Henry's keeping you. You must be cleverer than I am.
I've tried feeling pity for you, but it keeps on turning into something else.
Why pity?
You love Henry, but you love his kingdom too.
You look at him, and you see cities, acreage, coastline, taxes.
All I see is Henry.
Leave him to me, can't you?
I left him years ago.
And I thought
I could move you.
Were you always like this?
When I was young and worshipped you, is this what you were like?
Most likely.
Child, I'm finished, and I've come to give him anything he asks for.
Do you know what I should like for Christmas?
I should like to see you suffer.
Alais, just for you.
Alors, ma petite.
J'ai peur, maman.
No, no.
The sky is pocked with stars.
What eyes the wise men must have had to see a new one in so many.
You look cold. I've mulled some wine.
I wonder... were there fewer stars then?
I don't know. I fancy there's a mystery in it.
What's this?
Warm wine.
Why, so it is.
You are as beautiful as I remembered.
Off you go.
My widow wants to see me.
She came to find out what your plans are. I know.
She wants you back.
Go to your room.
So, you want me back.
She thinks I do.
She thinks the need for loving never stops.
She has a point.
I marvel at you.
After all these years, still like a democratic drawbridge, going down for everybody.
At my age, there's not much traffic anymore.
To your interminable health.
- Well, wife, what's on your mind?
- I've just seen Richard.
Splendid boy.
He says you fought.
We always do.
It's his impression that you mean to disinherit them.
I fancy I'll relent.
Don't you?
I don't much care.
In fact, I wonder, Henry, if I care for anything.
I wonder if I'm hungry out of habit.
I could listen to you lie for hours.
So your lust is rusty.
Gorgeous.
Henry, I'm so tired.
Sleep then. Sleep and dream of me withcroutons.
Henri a la mode.
- Henry, stop it.
- Eleanor, I haven't started.
What do you want? You want my name on paper? I'll sign anything.
You want the Aquitaine for John? It's John's.
It's his, it's yours, it's anybody's. In exchange for what?
For nothing.
For a little qulet.
For an end to this, for God's sake.
Sail me back to England, lock me up... and lose the key and let me be alone.
You have my oath.
I give my word.
Oh, well.
Well, well.
Would you like a pillow?
Footstool? How about a shawl?
Your oaths are all profanities, your words a curse, your name on paper is a waste of pulp!
I'm vilifying you, for
God's sake! Pay attention!
How, from where we started, did we ever reach this Christmas?
Step by step.
What happens to me now?
That's lively curiosity from such a dead cat.
If you want to know my plans, just ask me.
Conquer china, sack the vatican, or take the veil.
I'm not among the ones who give a damn.
Just let me sign my lands to John and go to bed.
No, you're too kind.
I can't accept.
Come on, man, I'll sign the thing in blood or spit or bright blue ink.
Let's have it done.
Let's not.
No, I don't think I want your signature on anything.
You don't?
Dear God, the pleasure I still get from goading you.
You don't want John to have my provinces? Bull's-eye.
I can't bear you when you're smug. I know, I know.
You don't want Richard, and you don't want John. You've grasped it.
All right, then, shatter me!
Let me have it.
What do you want?
A new wife.
Oh.
So,
I'm to be annulled.
Well, will the pope annul me, do you think?
The pontiff owes me one pontificate. I think he will.
Out Eleanor, in alais.
- Why?
- A new wife, wife, will bear me sons.
That is the single thing... of which I would have thought you had enough.
I want a son.
We could populate... a country town with country girls who've borne you sons.
How many is it?
Help me count the bastards.
All my sons are bastards.
You really mean to do it.
Lady love, with all my heart.
Your sons are part of you.
Like warts and goiters, and I'm having them removed.
We've made them.
They're our boys.
I know, and good God, look at them.
Geoffrey... there's a masterpiece.
He isn't flesh, he's a device.
He's wheels and gears.
And johnny... was his latest treason your idea?
I caught him lying, and I've said, "he's young."
I found him cheating, and
I've said, "he's just a boy."
I've watched him steal and whore and whip his servants, and he's not a child.
He's the man we made him.
Don't share John with me.
He's your accomplishment.
And Richard's yours.
How could you send him off to deal with Philip?
I was tired.
I was busy.
They were friends.
Eleanor, he was the best.
From the cradle on, you cradled him. I never had a chance.
You never wanted one. How do you know? You took him.
Separation from your husband you could bear, but not your son.
Whatever I have done, you made me do.
You threw me out of bed for Richard.
Not until you threw me out for rosamund.
It's not that simple. I won't have it to be that simple.
I adored you.
Never.
I still do.
Of all the lies, that one is the most terrible.
I know. That's why
I saved it up for now.
Oh, Henry, we've mangled everything we've touched.
Deny us what you will, we have done that.
Do you remember when we met?
Down to the hour and color of your stockings.
I could hardly see you for the sunlight.
It was raining, but no matter.
There was very little talk, as I recall.
Very little.
I had never seen such beauty.
I walked right up and touched it.
God, where did I find the gall to do that?
In my eyes.
I loved you.
No annulment.
What? There will be no annulment.
Will there not? No, I'm afraid you'll have to do without.
Well, it was just a whim.
I'm so relieved.
I didn't want to lose you.
Out of curiosity, as intellectual to intellectual, how in the name of bleeding jesus can you lose me?
Do we ever see each other?
Am I ever near you?
Ever with you? Am I ever anywhere but somewhere else?
Do I write?
Do we send messages?
Do dinghies bearing gifts float up the thames to you? Are you remembered?
You are.
You're no part of me. We do not touch at any point.
How can you lose me?
Can't you feel the chains?
You know me well enough to know I can't be stopped.
I don't have to stop you.
I have only to delay you.
Every enemy you have has friends in rome. We'll cost you time.
What is this?
I'm not moldering.
My paint's not peeling. I'm good for years. How many years?
Suppose I hold you back for one.
I can. It's possible.
Suppose your first son dies.
Ours did. It's possible.
Suppose you're daughtered next.
We were.
That, too, is possible.
How old is daddy then?
What kind of spindly, rickett-ridden, milky, wizened, dim-eyed, gammy-handed, limpy line of things will you beget?
It's sweet of you to care.
And when you die, which is regrettable but necessary, what will happen to frail alais and her pruney prince?
You can't think Richard's going to wait for your grotesque to grow.
You wouldn't let him do a thing like that?
Let him? I'd push him through the nursery door.
You're not that cruel.
Don't fret. We'll wait until you're dead to do it.
Eleanor, what do you want?
Just what you want... a king for a son.
You can make more, I can't.
You think I want to disappear?
One son is all I've got, and you can blot him out and call me cruel?
For these ten years, you've lived with everything I've lost... and loved another woman through it all, and I am cruel?
I could peel you like a pear, and God himself would call it justice.
I will die sometime soon.
One day I'll duck too slow, and at westminster, they'll sing out "long live the king" for someone else.
I beg you, let it be a son of mine.
I am not moved to tears.
I have no sons. You have too many sons. You don't need more.
Well, wish me luck.
I'm off.
To rome? That's where they keep the pope.
You don't dare go!
Say that again at noon.
You'll say it to my horse's ass.
Lamb, I'll be rid of you by easter!
You can count your reigning days!
You go to rome, we'll rise against you!
Who will? Richard, Geoffrey,
John and Eleanor of Aquitaine.
The day those stout hearts band together is the day that pigs get wings!
There'll be pork in the treetops come morning!
Don't you see you've given them a common cause: New sons?
You leave the country, and you've lost it.
- All of you at once?
- And Philip too. He'd join us.
Yes, he would.
Now how's your trip to rome?
Oh, I've got you, got you, got you.
Should I take a thousand men-at-arms, or is that showy?
Bluff away.
Ah, poor thing. How can I break the news? You've just miscalculated.
Have I? How?
You should have lied. You should have promised to be good while I was gone.
I would have let your three boys loose. They could have fought me then.
You wouldn't keep your sons locked up here.
Why the devil wouldn't I?
You wouldn't dare.
Why not? Let them sit in chinon for a while. I forbid it.
She forbids it. Did your father sleep with me, or didn't he?
No doubt you're going to tell me that he did. Would it upset you?
What about the thousand men? I say be gaudy and to hell with it.
Don't leave me, Henry. I'm at rock bottom. I'll do anything to keep you.
I think you think you mean it. Ask for something.
Eleanor, we're passed it, years passed. Test me. Name an act.
There isn't one! About my fornication with your father.
Yes, there is. You can expire. You first, old man. I only hope I'm there to watch.
You're so afraid of dying. You're so scared of it. Ah, poor Eleanor.
If only she'd lied. She did. She said she never loved your father.
I can always count on you.
I never touched you without thinking, "Geoffrey, Geoffrey."
The day you hurt me,
I'll cry out.
I've put more horns on you than Louis ever wore.
Am I supposed to care?
I'll kill you if you leave me.
You can try. I loved your father's body. He was beautiful.
It never happened. I can see his body now. Shall I describe it?
Eleanor, I hope you die!
His arms were rough, with scars here.
No!
I can feel his arms!
I feel them!
I feel it!
What?
Have I hurt you?
Let me finish!
You were in the next room when he did it!
Well, what family doesn't have its ups and downs?
I'm cold.
I can't feel anything.
Not anything at all.
We couldn't go back, could we, Henry?
William!
Up! Up!
When the king is off his ass, nobody sleeps!
Up! Up!
Up! Up!
Tell her to pack. She leaves when it's light.
Up, up!
- Henry?
- We're packing up and moving out.
Is there a war? What's happened?
Henry, what's the matter?
Nothing, for a change.
Would you believe it?
Where have you been all night?
What for? Making us an entourage.
We're off to rome to see the pope.
He's excommunicated you again.
No, he's going to set me free.
I'm having Eleanor annulled.
The nation will be shocked to learn our marriage wasn't consummated.
Oh, be serious.
I am.
It seems that you and I are getting married.
By the pope himself.
You mean it?
Shall I kneel?
It's not another trick? The bridal party's drilling on the cobblestones.
- She'll find a way to stop us.
- How? She won't be here.
We're launching her for salisbury tower when the winds change.
She'll be barging down the river by lunchtime.
If she doesn't stop us,
Richard will.
Not anymore, I've corked him up. He's in the cellar with his brothers and the wine.
The royal boys are aging with the royal port. You haven't said yes.
Would you like a formal declaration?
There, my finest angle.
It's on all the coins.
Sad alais, will you marry me?
Be my queen.
We'll love each other, and you'll give me sons.
Let's have six. We'll do Eleanor one better.
We'll call the first one
Louis, if you like.
Louls le premier. How's that for a king of England?
Henry, you can't ever let them out.
You've lost me. Let who out? Your sons.
You've put them in the dungeon, and you've got to keep them there forever.
Do I now? If they're free when you die, it's the dungeon or the nunnery for me.
But, Henry, what about the child?
Don't bother me about the child.
The damn thing isn't born yet.
If they're free, they'll kill it.
And I will not live to see our children murdered.
Henry!
Are you going down?
To let them out or to keep them in?
Could you say to a child of yours,
"you've seen the sunlight for the last time"?
Can you do it, Henry?
I shall have to, shan't I?
He's here.
He'll get no satisfaction out of me. He isn't going to see me beg.
Why, you chivalric fool, as if the way one fell down mattered.
When the fall is all there is, it matters.
My barge is sailing with the tide.
- I've come to say good-bye.
- Does Henry know you're here?
I've brought you each a little something. What's he planning?
Is he going to keep us here? For God's sake, mother. I picked it out especially.
- How heavy is the outside guard?
- That's taken care of.
The courtyard, the gates? They're putting
Henry's train together, and it's chaos.
You can walk right out. We'll go to poitiers. He'll expect that.
But we'll meet him with an army when he comes. You stick close to me.
When you run, run hard. Why run at all? I think we ought to stay.
Stay here? Till Henry comes.
He will come, won't he?
And he'll come alone.
I count three knives to one. You think we could?
I'd only do it wrong.
You kill him, I'll watch.
- Where are you going?
- Up for air.
Don't stop her. You don't think I'm gonna let this happen.
If you tell, there'll be a rash of executions, and you don't want that.
No, you don't want to lose one of us, not even me.
You're clever, but I wonder if you're right.
Warn him, it's the end of us. You warn him not, it's the end of him.
It's that clear.
Take the knives and run.
No, Geoffrey's right.
You're not an assassin.
Look again.
Richard.
Spare me that. You brought these things. You want him dead? You do it.
You unnatural animal.
Unnatural, mummy? You tell me, what's nature's way?
If poison mushrooms grow and babies come with crooked backs, if goiters thrive and dogs go mad... and wives kill husbands, what's unnatural?
Come, here stands your lamb. Come cover him in kisses. He's all yours.
No, you're not mine.
I'm not responsible.
Where do you think I learned this from? Who do you think I studied under?
How old was I when you fought with
Henry first? Young. I don't know.
How many battles did I watch? But those were battles, not a knife behind a door.
I never heard a corpse ask how it got so cold.
What were you thinking when you fought him?
You. I did it all for you!
Of your unnatural animal?
You wanted father dead.
No, never that.
You tried to kill him.
Why? What did you want? Yes!
I wanted Henry back.
Liar!
I wanted Henry.
Don't trust her. She'll warn him if she gets a chance.
Dear, dear, whatever shall we do with mother?
It wants light.
What we do in dungeons needs the shades of day.
I stole the candles from the chapel.
Jesus won't begrudge them, and the chaplain works for me.
You look dreadful.
So do you.
I underslept a little.
We can all rest in a little while.
There, that's better.
Bright and clear, just like the morning.
Fine looking boy.
What do you want from us?
You must be mad.
Why did you have to come here?
Damn it, why did you come?
You were the best.
I told her so.
You, I loved.
You're going to keep us here.
You can't ever let me out.
You know you can't.
I'll never stop.
I can't stop either.
Brave boys... that's what I have.
Come for me.
What's wrong?
You're Richard, aren't you?
But you're Henry.
Please, take me back.
Can't we try again?
Again?
We always have before.
Oh, yes, we always have.
Go on!
Execute him.
They're assassins, aren't they?
This was treason, wasn't it?
You gave them life.
You take it.
Who's to say it's monstrous?
I'm the king. I call it just.
Therefore, I, Henry, by the grace of God, king of the english, lord of scotland, ireland and wales, count of anjou, brittany, poutou and normandy, maine, gascony and Aquitaine, do sentence you to death.
Done this Christmas day in chinon in God's year 1183.
Surely that's not what I intended.
Children.
Children.
They're all we have.
Go on.
I'm done.
I'm finished with you.
You and I are finished.
You spare the rod, you'll spoil those boys.
I couldn't do it, Eleanor.
Nobody thought you could.
Come rest.
I want no women in my life. You're tired.
I could have conquered europe, all of it, but I had women in my life.
Go on, get out.
Go on.
I should have killed you years ago.
You put me here. You made me do mad things. You've bled me.
Shoulder it yourself.
Don't put it on my back.
Pick it up and carry it.
I can.
My losses are my work.
What losses?
I'm the one with nothing.
Lost your life's work, have you?
Provinces are nothing.
Land is dirt.
I could take defeats like yours and laugh. I've done it.
If you're broken, it's because you're brittle.
I've lost.
You won.
And I can't ever have you back again.
You're all that I have ever loved.
Christ, you don't know what nothing is.
I want to die.
No, you don't.
I want to die.
I'll hold you.
Henry, I want to die.
Eleanor.
I want to die.
Let me hold you.
I want to die.
You will, you know, someday.
Just wait long enough, and it'll happen.
So it will.
We're in the cellar, you're going back to prison, my life is wasted, we've lost each other, and you're smiling.
It's the way
I register despair.
There's everything in life but hope.
We're both alive.
And for all I know, that's what hope is.
We're jungle creatures,
Henry, and the dark is all around us.
See them... in the corners?
You can see the eyes.
And they can see ours.
I'm a match for anything.
Aren't you?
I should have been a great fool... not to love you.
You'll let me out for easter?
Come the resurrection, you can strike me down again.
Perhaps next time
I'll do it.
And perhaps you won't.
You know,
I hope we never die!
So do I.
You think there's any chance of it?
Portsmouth, December, 1787.
I looked upon the vessel
that was to take me to the Island of Tahiti.
A destination so far from England
that one couldn't go farther
without starting to come home.
And the length of the journey was equaled
by the importance of its mission.
What could be more vital
than to find and cultivate
a nourishing new food
that cost nothing to grow?
A blessing for the poor,
the hungry of the world.
It was a mission close to my heart.
And it was I who had been chosen
from amongst
all the gardeners in England.
Oh, beg pardon.
Can you tell me if this boat is the Bounty?
- Boat, did you say?
- Yes.
- A boat! It's a ship, you landlubber.
- Hey, what kind of a seaman's this?
- He's a peddler.
- You selling something, chum?
I'm not a peddler. I'm a gardener.
Assistant Botanist at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew.
You know Kew Gardens, of course.
Kew's outside London.
You lost your way, mate.
Well, I haven't lost my way if this boat,
I beg your pardon, if this ship is the Bounty.
Aye, it's the Bounty, all right.
Then, perhaps one of you gentlemen could tell me where I sign on?
I wonder what a gardener's doing onboard, huh?
Gonna plant roses in me hammock, are you?
Good thing, too, the way you smell.
Hold on, hold on. Look. Empty pots.
I know. We're going to Tahiti to fill them with something, right?
Well, one usually fills empty pots with something.
- What'd you got here? Little telescope?
- Be careful, please.
These are scientific documents.
Agronomy records.
- They're what?
- Agronomy records.
They're sketches, really.
- Sketches?
- Sketches of breadfruit.
- Breadfruit?
- Breadfruit?
You mean, where we're going, bread grows on trees?
Bread trees.
That's daft enough for a shipload, eh?
There's nothing daft about breadfruit.
It is a very real food. A staple, like wheat.
- Here.
- Goofy-looking weed.
It's funny that nobody's ever heard of this before, then.
No one ever heard of the potato until Sir Francis Drake brought it from South America.
It altered European economy.
Breadfruit may alter it again.
I wonder what it tastes like.
The West Indies Company plans to feed it to the slaves in Jamaica no matter what it tastes like.
But then, if it becomes popular, they'll feed it to the world.
Gentlemen, we're about to embark on a very momentous journey.
Personally, I'm proud to be part of it.
Now, where do I sign on?
I'll show you. Come along with me.
Breadfruit? Did you ever hear of that? A breadfruit?
Now come on, love, you got me money.
What more do you want?
- But when do you get paid?
- Now, come on, love. Get off the ship.
Hey, Scratch.
Sign on me mate here, will you?
Make your mark right there.
Captain coming aboard!
He was master of the Resolution under Captain Cook.
- What's he like?
- A hard one.
- I sailed under him.
- But he walks like a sailor, anyway.
- Mr. Fryer.
- Captain, sir.
- How is the crew shaping?
- A prime lot, I'd say, sir.
- And all volunteers.
- Good.
I'd like my chest brought aboard,
Mr. Fryer.
If you have a sober hand who can be trusted not to desert.
At your service, sir.
Mills is a good man, sir.
Remain by my cabin.
I'll have other errands.
Aye, aye, sir.
Come on, give me a hand, mate.
You're not backward in pushing yourself forward, are you?
You keep your pork-nose where it belongs and give me a hand with the Captain's gear.
Well, don't be touchy, mate.
Got a long voyage ahead, you know.
That's true. There it is.
Always speak up for the easy tasks in port, to be spared the difficult ones at sea.
What's this? A Royal visit?
That's Mr. Christian's carriage, sir.
Is it, now?
So, I've had a career fop palmed onto me as a first mate.
- You haven't met him yet, sir?
- He was assigned only yesterday.
Moorechild was my choice.
He was taken ill with some malady or other.
Aye, nothing compares with a woman washed all over, smelling like a Frenchman.
Fletcher Christian, Lieutenant, come aboard to join, sir.
Lieutenant Christian.
You are a naval lieutenant, I presume?
Yes. Please forgive my appearance, sir.
I was staying with friends in the country when my orders reached me.
- So, I came directly.
- I see.
- This is Mr. Fryer, our sailing master.
- Oh, yes.
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Fryer.
- Same to you, Mr. Christian.
Yes, we sailed together.
Let me show your men your cabin.
Your pardon, sir.
You've come none too soon.
Please be about your duties without delay.
Your indulgence, sir.
I have two charming friends here who insist upon seeing me to my ship.
And they also insist upon meeting the Captain.
They say it's important.
- Very well.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Ned.
- Fletcher.
- How are you?
- I'd heard you were going to be with us.
- Yes. We'll be together.
- What luck.
- Well, if you'll excuse me.
- Certainly.
We'll dine together.
Wonderful lad.
His mother's a great friend of the family.
Lady Young. Wonderful horsewoman, also.
Trains them herself, if you can imagine.
I'll try.
I'm sorry, Madam. I do not speak French.
Oh, for shame, Captain.
That's uncivilized of you.
I humbly apologize.
May I present Captain Bligh, the Lady Gwendolyn Arbast.
- Milady.
- Delighted to meet you, Captain.
May I compliment you upon your distinguished record of command?
The compliment's slightly premature, Milady.
This is my first captaincy.
- The first of many, I'm sure.
- Thank you.
Good luck, Captain.
Come along, Therese.
Excuse me, sir.
No, don't bother to come with us, Fletcher.
Last minute attentions are always hollow and you are insincere to start with.
Oh, dear.
Well, sir,
I understand we're taking this river scow halfway round the world on a grocer's errand.
I take a somewhat different view.
So do their Lordships of the Admiralty.
- Do they really? How extraordinary.
- Tell me, what is a man of your particular interests doing in the navy?
Oh, process of elimination.
There's something dusty about the army and affairs of state are rather a bore.
You know, one must do something.
Here's a fellow trying to catch your eye, sir.
Looks like an embalmer.
Beg pardon, sir. Might I have a word?
- Are you our gardener from Kew?
- Yes, sir. Brown, sir.
- Good. Found your quarters yet?
- No, sir.
Get him a good billet.
This is the most important man aboard.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Well, I'm hardly that, but thank you, sir.
I have a message for you, sir, from our chief botanist.
Well, what is it?
He has reached the conclusion that the breadfruit has a dormant period, sir.
According to his experiments, it begins some time in October.
A dormant period?
Four or five months when the fruit cannot be transplanted.
The cuttings die.
Well, October's some way off.
That shouldn't worry us, unless your botanist is wrong about the date.
Exactly, sir.
- Mr. Christian.
- Yes, sir?
Oh, sir, does it really matter when these vegetables arrive in Jamaica?
It matters to the tune of £1,000 a day, Mr. Christian.
My word, that is an impressive amount, yes.
The West India merchants are impressed by it.
So is the Admiralty. And so am I.
It is my intention to land our cargo in Jamaica, as far ahead of the Admiralty's timetable as is humanly possible.
Yes. Well, one can understand that.
Doing so, one can look forward to promotions and even honors.
And all that, yes.
I will do exactly all that, Mr. Christian.
Which brings me to the subject of yourself.
I will tolerate nothing less than a man's best efforts, officer or seaman.
Highborn connections are no substitute for hard work.
No, indeed they're not, sir.
But, personally, I see no reason why a good officer cannot be a gentleman, as well.
- Do you disagree, sir?
- Not if he's first a good officer.
It's a debatable point, but a good subject for a dinner's conversation.
But I'm keeping Mr. Brown waiting.
And I mustn't neglect the most important man on our ship.
Excuse me, sir.
Hello, Brown.
- Make ready for sail, Mr. Christian.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Hands to stations for leaving harbor!
Aye, aye, sir!
All hands to stations for leaving harbor!
All hands on deck!
All hands to stations for leaving harbor!
All right, now, heavy on it!
Step round.
Let go and hold!
Ship ready for sea, sir.
Set topsails and headsails. Starboard tack.
Set topsails and headsails.
Set topsails and headsails!
Set gallants!
- Set gallants!
- Sheet home!
Set royals!
Set royals!
Midships, steady as she goes.
- Bos'n's mate!
- Aye, sir?
Pipe up spirits.
Up spirits!
Watch below, muster for grog on the upper deck!
Hey, Mills.
Mr. Christian wants a word with you on the quarterdeck.
The fact is,
I'm a little slow sometimes and...
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.
Mack here is reporting a theft.
- What? Already?
- Aye, sir.
Carry on with your investigations.
Seaman Mills at your service, sir.
No labor too long, no job too hard, sir.
Well, you're a light-hearted fellow, as well as a light-fingered one.
Sir?
It seems that in a moment of exuberance, you stole two 25-pound cheeses.
I stole two 25-pound cheeses, sir?
You wish to deny it?
Well, speak up, Mills.
Why, yes I do, sir. Of course. Certainly, sir.
First of all, sir,
I'd be grateful to know who's accusing me.
Yes, of course. This observant chap here says he saw you take them before we left Portsmouth.
Well, he saw wrong, sir.
Or else he's a bloody liar.
- Are you a bloody liar? Answer freely.
- No, sir.
I saw him take them those two cheeses with me own eyes.
Mr. Christian, testing one man's word against another's is an empty procedure.
List the shortage as unsolved theft and stop the men's cheese ration
- until the deficit is made up.
- As you say, sir.
- Well, that'll be all, Mills.
- Thank you, sir.
Was there something further you wished to discuss?
Early Renaissance sketching, perhaps?
No, sir. Sorry, sir.
Let it lay, whatever it is. Let it lay.
- I got a little score to settle.
- Look, son, this is a small ship.
Fill it with grudges and there'd be no room left to live in.
And you're listening to 30 years at sea.
You don't preach to me, McCoy, and I won't preach to you. All right?
It's a good bargain, with you the loser.
You can thank your good friend Mills for this.
Now, this is the way it's gonna be.
Captain's orders.
There'll be no cheese issue until the shortage is made up.
You understand? And you?
So we've got a bootlicker onboard, eh?
A troublemaker.
- It wasn't my fault.
- Hey, what's the matter?
I don't like to be called a thief, that's all.
- A thief?
- A thief, that's right.
I'll teach you a lesson.
- Squealing on the boys.
- Hey!
I like a bit of cheese with my grub.
Maybe it's you who should take the licking.
Now look here.
It was the Captain asked me take the cheeses to his home, as a favor.
It's always the same in this blasted navy.
You do a job for an officer like that, you're called a thief.
And the crew lose their cheeses.
- So, you did the Captain a favor, eh?
- It was the Captain.
The Captain helping himself to the ship's stores.
- Hey.
- The Captain's the thief, not me!
The Articles of War provide most adequately for a man who calls his Captain a thief.
I think a few weeks without grog will teach him to hold his tongue.
No. Two dozen with the lash will teach him better still.
All hands to witness punishment.
Mr. Christian, if you please.
"If any officer, mariner or soldier, in or belonging to the fleet,
"shall behave himself with contempt to his superior officer,
"such superior officer being in the execution of his office,
"he shall be punished according to the nature of his offense."
Two dozen lashes.
Ship's company, on hats.
You just remember, it ain't me that's whipping you.
Don't worry, I'll live.
You know, mate, it ain't me. Remember.
Stop worrying. You're making me nervous.
Lay on, Quintal.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
- Six.
- You're going too lightly, Quintal.
Lay on with a will or you'll take his place.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
You were ordered to witness punishment.
You can't turn away.
Thirteen.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
Twenty.
Twenty-one.
Twenty-two.
Twenty-three.
Twenty-four.
Company dismissed!
Lay away lee braces!
You are not eating, Mr. Young.
- With your permission, I'm not hungry, sir.
- Permission denied.
We'll not have food wasted.
- Eat your supper.
- Aye, sir.
Not a very sociable group tonight.
As a matter of fact, sir,
I was about to make a remark when you spoke.
You're pardoned.
Something troubling you, Mr. Christian?
No, sir. It's nothing. I just...
Well, I don't feel my cheeriest after watching a man take a severe lashing.
Pass Mr. Young the potatoes, please.
You've witnessed punishment before, surely.
Go ahead, speak your mind.
Well, sir, since you ask, it's...
It's the question of degree that troubles me.
You see, if one flogs a man half to death for a minor infraction, then how does one punish him for a serious offense?
Minor infraction, you said?
Yes. I think that two cheeses, sir...
Plus the word "thief" applied to his Captain.
But you still feel, though, that stopping the man's grog was sufficient punishment?
Well, I agree with you.
- You agree?
- Eat it up. Excellent stew.
If we were concerned with only the one case, certainly.
- Well, I don't know...
- Hear me.
You will, all of you, no doubt command your own ships some day.
Let us suppose that your vessel is running in heavy seas.
The shrouds are covered with ice.
A gale is blowing.
It becomes necessary, in your opinion, to order a seaman aloft.
He realizes, of course, that if his fingers slip from the icy shrouds for a split second, he'll perish immediately.
Now, this is a typical seaman, a half-witted, wife-beating, habitual drunkard.
His whole life is spent evading and defying authority.
Tell me, sir.
What is it that makes this man go aloft?
I think, depending on the man, sir, any number of things.
You can put it in one word. Fear.
Fear of what you'll do to him.
Fear of punishment so vivid in his mind that he fears it even more than sudden death.
Now don't mistake me.
I'm not advising cruelty or brutality with no purpose.
My point is that cruelty with purpose is not cruelty.
It's efficiency.
But a man will never disobey you once he's watched his mate's backbone laid bare.
He'll remember those white ribs staring at him, he'll see the flesh jump and hear the whistle of the whip for the rest of his life.
Well, perhaps you're right, sir.
I'd be careful of that cheese if I were you, sir.
It has a peculiar smell.
I think it's a bit tainted.
But then, of course, it's a question of individual taste.
It's damn good port.
In the following weeks,
Captain Bligh worked the ship
for every furlong of gain it could give.
Every inch of canvas spread,
and God help the helmsman
if the wake were not arrow-straight.
Captain Bligh must've asked me
the same question a score of times.
"What day saw the beginning
of the breadfruit's dormant period?"
I told him repeatedly,
I could not name the exact date
for lack of knowing it.
It became clear he'd begun to worry
lest we arrive too late.
He studied his charts hour on hour,
I could not imagine why.
I'd been told there was only one way
to get to the other side of the world.
The long way,
around the Cape of Good Hope
at the bottom of Africa.
That was the course with favoring winds.
As for the other route,
the westward passage around the Horn,
while arithmetic said "yes" to that,
weather said "no."
May I share your merriment?
Just a pleasantry, sir. It was nothing.
Mayn't I be included?
Well, it was just the way you were walking, sir.
It reminded me of a mutual friend,
Lord Folkestone.
- Do continue.
- Well, that's all, sir.
What was the resemblance?
Well, you just both have this distinctive walk, sir.
Really? In what way distinctive?
Well, he was kicked by a horse, sir.
I'd rather not say where, sir.
It had the effect of making him walk most oddly.
Poor fellow.
I see.
You may make yourself comfortable at the masthead, Mr. Young.
Please remain there until I summon you.
Aye, sir.
Don't repeat that mistake, Mr. Christian.
I'm not a figure of fun.
Indeed, you're not, sir.
- Make the course south southwest, please.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Bos'n's mate!
- Did you say south southwest, sir?
- I did.
- Lee braces!
- Lee braces it is, sir!
- Down helm.
- Down helm, sir!
- Hold her steady south southwest.
- South southwest, sir.
- Take away those weather sheets!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Going around the Horn will take five months off our journey.
Well, we shall have ourselves quite a little adventure.
What amuses you now?
I was just thinking, sir, that our little errand for groceries might wind up in a page of naval history.
If we succeed in negotiating the Horn in the dead of winter.
Why shouldn't we succeed?
Admiral Anderson did.
Yes, but of course he didn't choose to attempt it in a 91-foot chamber pot.
In any event, his was the only ship to do it, and I believe he lost 50 percent of his crew.
You might point that out to the crew.
It should improve their performance.
Remember, fear is our best weapon.
Good night, sir.
- When should I recall Mr. Young, sir?
- When I come on deck in the morning.
I want to see how comically he walks.
Poor fellow.
But, perhaps, in the morning, sir, he won't be able to walk at all.
Perhaps.
Good night, sir.
Good fellow.
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we really making for the Horn?
Yes, evidently.
May Heaven protect us.
I was in Admiral Anderson's ship, sir.
Were you, really?
Did you find it interesting?
Interesting, sir?
It was like riding a cork over a waterfall, sir.
And wind is not the name for what blows in your face.
It's something made of iron, swings at you from the west, never changing, day in and day out.
With seas as high as the mainmast.
We had lifelines rigged everywhere, sir, and there were still 16 men washed overboard.
Cold?
Three men froze in the yards.
Frozen stiff, sir.
Couldn't get them down without cutting their fingers loose from the shrouds.
I was lucky.
Well, that's the Horn for you, sir.
A delightful passage.
Good morning, sir.
And good morning to you, Ned.
Did you sleep well?
- My hands, I can't move them at all.
- Steady.
Easy, Ned.
- There's no feeling in them, Fletcher.
- Easy, Ned. Easy, Ned.
None at all.
Can't you understand? Absolute...
You're being undignified.
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.
Come along.
I don't think I can walk very well, Fletcher.
Well, don't be self-conscious.
We shall probably all walk like Lord Folkestone before this voyage is over.
There you are.
Very good, Ned. Very good.
She's straining badly, sir.
Yes, I'll have the t'gallants off of her,
Mr. Morrison.
Watch on deck, t'gallants fore line!
Bos'n's mate, call all hands!
All hands on deck!
Step lively, now. Come on.
Jump to it!
Try again...
Come on, let's get on with it!
We don't want be here if this stick breaks!
I think that's better, sir.
I have seen this storm.
Afraid of a little weather, Mr. Christian?
Set the t'gallants again.
But, you see, sir, the masts are straining, sir.
- You arguing with me?
- By no means, sir.
I was simply answering your question.
- Mr. Morrison, set the t'gallants again!
- Aye, sir!
All right, you men.
Up aloft and set the t'gallants again.
Any excuse to retard our progress, eh,
Mr. Christian?
But you wrong me, sir, if you believe that
I would willfully obstruct our progress.
Come now, why don't you admit you wouldn't lift a finger to speed it?
But that's absurd, sir.
Why should I not wish to do my best?
Because you are the sort of self-styled gentleman who thinks only one thought.
You feel only one emotion, contempt.
Contempt for effort, for ambition, for anyone born less fortunate than yourself.
You are poisoned with contempt,
Mr. Christian, and it makes you useless to me.
But I assure you, sir, that the execution of my duties is entirely unaffected by my private opinion of you.
Be certain of that, Mr. Christian.
Be most entirely certain.
Land ho!
Land ho!
Prepare the ship for heavy weather, if you please.
Aye, aye, sir.
Bos'n, prepare the ship for heavy weather!
Aye, aye, sir!
Ahoy, below!
Breakers dead ahead!
They ain't no breakers. They're combers.
Two oceans meeting head on.
Lend a hand, Norman.
Captain's orders to wear ship,
Mr. Christian!
- Do so!
- Aye, aye, sir!
All hands on deck! Come on!
Come on, come on. All hands lay aloft!
We've only just come below.
Listen here, what's he think he's doing?
Come on, come on!
The forward storeroom, sir!
A barrel has broken loose.
- Take over, Mr. Fryer!
- Aye, aye, sir!
Up helm!
Up helm!
Quickly there. Move!
Mills, Norman, Bennet...
Watch it!
Bennet!
Wait a moment. Go tell Mr. Fryer to let her run before the wind.
Right!
We've got to get a lash on it.
- Mr. Fryer, sir.
- What is it, Mills?
Mr. Christian said, let her run before the wind.
Before the wind?
We can't lash the barrels until she steadies.
- All right, go below.
- Right you are, sir.
- Midships to helm!
- Midships to helm!
Quintal, stand away.
Now hold off till she steadies.
Hold her steady before the wind!
All right, she's steady.
Norman, Quintal, get a lash on that cask.
Pass me a line!
What the hell are you doing, Mr. Fryer?
Mr. Christian's orders, sir.
Barrel broke loose...
- Put the helm over instantly!
- But Mr. Christian's below, sir,
- with a work party.
- Put the helm over!
- Down with helm.
- Down with helm, it is, sir.
Idiots!
Secure those barrels.
Easy now, easy.
Careful.
Gently now.
Move him carefully.
I'll get the medicine chest.
- He's dead.
- Mr. Christian!
Mr. Christian!
Are you deaf as well as irresponsible?
I demand an explanation.
I thought she was holding steadily enough, sir.
I ordered Norman under a water cask...
Never mind Norman. Answer me.
Never mind Norman, sir?
There was no justification in your ordering the ship hove to.
We lost a full league before I could countermand your order, one full league!
- You countermanded my order, sir?
- Now, you heed me well, Mr. Christian.
We are embarked upon a King's mission.
Any further attempt at sabotage and I will deal with you as a traitor.
When you countermanded that order, sir, you crushed the life out of Thomas Norman.
I suppose you would halt the ship again for his burial service.
Since we are not at war, sir,
I would hope to give him a decent burial.
Yes, sir.
I am at war.
Against ill winds, contrary currents and incompetent officers.
You'd best join my war, Mr. Christian, for if I don't start winning soon, the casualty list will be real enough.
Aye, aye, sir!
I make our position here by dead reckoning.
If that's right, sir, another three weeks will see us through.
We'll get through.
The pumps holding their own?
- Aye, sir.
- Good.
We'll go on the other tack now.
Tack ship, if you please.
Aye, aye, sir.
All hands on deck!
Tack ship! Come on, Williams, up top!
- Gently, gently.
- Get up, the Horn waits for no man.
He'll drown the lot of us.
I know the way that man's mind works.
- I felt it on my back.
- Stop your grousing.
Portsmouth or Cape Horn, it's all one to a seaman.
Well, it can't stay overcast forever, sir.
Four weeks blind tacking is forever,
Mr. Fryer, and you know it!
Other tack, wear ship!
Downwind in this weather, sir, is very dangerous.
We have no choice!
- Weather braces!
- Aye, aye, sir!
Starboard watch on deck!
Starboard watch on deck!
All hands on deck!
What's the matter?
Up helm!
Steer two points to starboard!
Be ready to reverse your helm!
Lay away lee braces! All the way!
All the way weather braces!
We're back where we started four weeks ago!
Bad news, sir.
Your cabin's completely awash.
The pumps are barely able to hold their own, sir.
We've lost, Mr. Fryer.
- Make way for the Cape of Good Hope.
- Aye, aye, sir!
Lay away lee braces!
Downward off the mizzen.
Here, here, here. What's all this, then?
That, old son, is half a ration of meat.
- What do you mean half a ration?
- Captain's orders.
Orders! You dish up a full plate of that or I'll cut your curls off.
I don't make the rules, I just dish the stuff.
That's all you're gonna get, you'd better take it.
He's right.
Half-rations are better than none at all.
- Why half-rations? What for?
- Make up time, I suppose.
Well, starving a man doesn't make the ship go no faster.
It saves stopping for stores, doesn't it?
Oh, so to catch up a couple of weeks, we starve all the way to Tahiti, eh?
I'll tell you one thing, it's against the regulations.
Regulations?
If we can be flogged by the regulations, we can be fed by them.
Good. You convinced me.
Now, go and convince the Captain.
All right.
Anybody coming along with me?
- To see the Captain?
- That's right, the Captain.
You sure it's regulation?
How do you know?
Because I read them.
A sailor with an education, like a singing pig.
All right, I'm with you.
What are you men doing in these quarters?
I brought them, sir.
They wish to state a complaint.
Let them do so.
Speak up.
I'm begging your pardon, sir.
We're sorry to disturb you, sir.
If this isn't a good moment, sir, why, this is nothing that won't...
That won't keep a while, sir.
No, no, no. Please continue.
I'm always available to hear complaints.
Well, Captain, sir, we've...
We've come representing the whole crew.
It's about the half-rations, sir.
And they ain't right, sir.
I'd like to...
The crew would like to remind you, sir, what it says in the regulations.
You dare to quote the regulations to me?
The regulations was made to go by, sir.
We don't mean no impertinence, sir.
But right is right, sir.
Five full months you've cost me, you fumbling idlers.
Us? How, sir? What did we do?
This commission gave every man in the ship's company the key to opportunity, the chance to show what he's made of.
Well, you've shown what you're made of.
Dirt and empty silk nightcaps.
Well, I thought I heard your voice, sir.
Good night.
So you want full rations, do you?
Well, I'll give you all the rations you need to get us to Tahiti in time.
Now get out!
"All the rations you need
to get us to Tahiti on time. "
Those were Captain Bligh's words.
Rations of what, he didn't say.
But he soon showed us.
Rations of
his favorite commodity, punishment.
Served up to the tune
of his favorite music,
a cry of pain, a scream of agony.
That was the concert that played us
across three oceans
as the months vanished from the calendar.
And Captain Bligh's tension increased.
Three.
Come down on deck, you clumsy lubbers!
And that jib, hoist it taut.
Land ho!
Land ho!
This island is inhabited by over 200,000 savages.
Eleven years ago, when I was here with Captain Cook, they were not dangerous.
However, the natives of the Sandwich Islands seemed friendly enough, but without warning, they turned on Captain Cook and killed him.
We shall take all due military precautions.
In the event we find ourselves welcome, you will discover that these savages have absolutely no conception of ordinary morality.
And you will, no doubt, take full advantage of their ignorance.
It is a matter of supernatural indifference to me whether you contaminate the natives or the natives contaminate you.
I have but one concern, our mission.
Let any one of you provoke an incident which endangers it, and I shall cause that man to curse his mother for giving him birth.
Lee braces, Mr. Christian.
Stand by the anchor!
Let off.
Hoist out the launch. I shall want 12 men.
- Aye, aye.
- Mr. Fryer, give them muskets.
And arm another six men and put them in the cutter.
At the first sign of treachery, you will open fire
- and help us to retreat.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Select a work detail before you go ashore.
Advise Mr. Christian.
If our reception is friendly, start gathering the plants right away.
One plant will be enough to tell the story, sir, but I shall have to find a specimen that has sprouted from the root.
- Then instruct your men accordingly.
- Very good, sir.
No, not as a walking stick, Brown.
Bring the cutter in closer.
King George?
No, Your Excellency.
But King George ordered me to pay his compliments to King Hitihiti.
I talk you talk. I go Captain Cook.
Visit many islands.
You Mr. Bligh. Me Minarii.
I know, I remember you well.
Our island pilot, and a fine one.
Oh, yes, very wonderful.
Will you please tell King Hitihiti that King George sends many tokens of friendship?
Hitihiti say, what he have,
King George want.
This is what we have come for,
Your Excellency, breadfruit.
That's right, uru.
King George wants his people to be as strong as your people.
He wants your breadfruit to nourish them.
Hitihiti say take all breadfruit you want.
You are most grateful, Your Excellency.
Thank you.
Here you are, Brownie. This is one, isn't it?
No, no. Nothing like it.
Brown, is that it over there?
Right you are, sir.
Right you are.
Artocarpus incisa.
Isn't it amazing?
Such a delicate sprig with the power to feed a continent.
You know, there's evidence to prove that a diet of breadfruit can sustain life all by itself.
Whose life? Not mine.
Lay on, Mills.
Watch your toes there.
They're like a string of live pearls.
- It must be some sort of game.
- Women only!
- Damn dull game.
- Oh, it has its possibilities.
Not a single man among them.
How many women do you suppose are down there?
Enough.
Here! Do you think we need to tell the others?
Look at those, fellows.
They're flogging the water.
- What they do?
- Chase fish for feast.
You like go?
Go ask him. Go on.
I'll ask him.
- There. Now, you see the new roots.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
Almost like little veins, aren't they, stretching down into the earth?
- Would you just... For a moment, sir.
- What?
What is it, Mills?
It's a debatable point.
Some favor the longer, some the shorter.
They're fishing, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir, but seeing them down there, working their fingers to the bones, well, we thought, that is, the lads and I thought, that we might just, well, nip along and give them a little hand, sir.
Something to talk about when we get home, sir.
Yes, sir, considering our mission, sir.
Well, can we give them a hand, sir?
Yes, I think we should all give them a hand.
Mr. Christian, I'm ready for a man to help me ball the root.
- To what?
- Ball the root.
Well...
- Mills?
- Gosh, sir, I...
I don't know a thing about gardening, sir.
Honest, I don't.
Well, go on, then!
Thank you, sir.
- I'm ready, Mr. Christian.
- Oh, damn you, Brown! I'm coming.
Mates! Hey, mates. What's that?
Don't be scared.
I'm going to take you home with me.
- Well, is it dormant, or isn't it?
- I couldn't say, sir.
Only the transplant itself can answer you, by living or dying.
And when can I expect its decision?
Perhaps 12 hours, perhaps three weeks, sir.
Excellent. You can't say yet.
Perhaps 12 hours, perhaps three weeks.
We've traveled a gardener 29,000 miles to be told we don't even know the condition of the breadfruit. Excellent!
You know, I heard that if that bread plant dries up, we could be here four or five months.
- You better pray it don't, mate.
- Pray it don't? What do you mean?
How did you like your voyage out here, then?
Nice? Comfortable?
Nothing but fair and proper treatment from the Captain, eh?
Worst I ever remember.
Well, what makes you want to get underway, then?
Use your head.
If Captain Bligh was cooped up here for five months, five months, mark you, who do you think he'd take it out on?
You think we sweat a bit, making for the Horn?
Wait till he breaks our back making for Jamaica.
We'll worry about that when it comes. Here!
- Aye.
- Might as well at that, mates.
I wonder why they make those women eat alone?
Because if they didn't, you'd be too busy to eat.
Funny lot, aren't they?
They let us make free with their women.
They won't let us eat with them.
Isn't that like knocking at the wrong door?
Hitihiti say,
Captain dance with daughter now.
Dance? No, not me.
I thank Your Excellency, but I don't dance.
No say no. Hitihiti angry.
My apologies, Your Excellency.
I did not understand.
- You are amused?
- No, I hope I shall not be, sir.
But it does seem a rather difficult dance, doesn't it?
We shall see.
Sorry to spoil your evening, sir, but you said you wished to be informed of any development.
It looks wilted, Brown.
It's dead, sir.
Might there not be other plants that will flourish?
Sir, this proves that the dormant season has begun.
Well, you did the best you could, sir.
It's a pity the Admiralty will blame you, in any case, for the delay.
But, it's an unjust world. My sympathy!
I dislike failure.
I dislike it as much as the Admiralty does.
Forgive me. I have a partner over there.
Forgive me, please.

Couldn't you have talked sooner?
It would've gone easier for you.
He finally came clean.
Give him some coffee.
Don't worry.
Drink this.
You'll feel better.
Don't take it so hard, fella.
At ease.
Is it true?
- Looks like it. 3 rue des Abderames.
Get him dressed.
Buck up.
It's all over now.
Just one last little effort.
Can you stand?
Let go of him.
Here, put this on.
It'll suit you fine.
We're going to the Casbah now.
They won't recognize you in that.
Show us Ali La Pointe's hideout.
Then you'll be free.
Give him a cap and dress him.
You're inducted!
Cut the clowning, Lagloy!
Let's go.
Knock it off!
Wanna go through another round?
Quit fooling around.
Pull yourself together.
THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS
Maybe they don't know we're here.
Ali La Pointe, the house is surrounded. It's useless.
Give yourselves up.
Let the boy and the woman out first.
Then the other man with you.
After that, you come out.
Leave your weapons behind.
No tricks. You're done for.
We have you covered.
You don't have a chance. Got that?
You hear me, Ali?
Listen good! You're the last one.
It's all over.
The organization's finished.
Everyone's dead or in prison.
If you come out now, you'll get a fair trial.
Make up your mind!
THE EUROPEAN QUARTER
THE CASBAH
National Liberation Front (FLN),
Communiqué No. 1:
People of Algeria, our combat is directed against colonialism.
Our aim: Independence and restoration of the Algerian state, in accordance with Islamic principles and the respect of basic liberties, regardless of race or religion.
To avoid bloodshed, we propose that the French authorities negotiate with us our right to self-determination.
Algerians, it is your duty to save your country and restore its liberty.
Its victory will be yours.
Forward, brothers! Unite!
The FLN calls you to arms.
Ladies and gents, place your bets.
This loses, this loses...
Ace wins.
500 francs.
Your turn, madam.
Ace wins, this one loses.
He's always there!
- What's his big hurry?
- Stop him.
Bash the bastard's head in!
Omar, Ali.
Alias Ali La Pointe.
Born January 15, 1930, in Miliana.
Illiterate.
Occupation: Laborer, bricklayer, boxer.
Currently unemployed.
Military status: Draft dodger.
1942, Algiers Juvenile Court, one year in reformatory for vandalism.
1944, Oran Juvenile Court, two years for disorderly conduct.
1949, Court of Algiers, eight-month prison term for insulting a police officer on duty.
Allah is great!
Long live Algeria!
Shut up! There he is.
Keep quiet.
FIVE MONTHS LATER
Beat it!
"Men have two faces.
One smiles, the other cries."
They sent you?
Yes, they sent me.
Here.
Wait!
Come back here.
Know how to read?
- Sure.
Read it to me.
"There's a Moorish café on rue Randon, in the Casbah.
Merabi, the owner, is a police informer.
Every afternoon at 5:00, a French policeman stops by.
He stays a few minutes, long enough to drink a coffee and get information.
Then he leaves.
You are to kill the policeman."
- Not Merabi?
- No, the policeman.
Okay.
"You can't go wrong.
Right next to the café you'll see a girl with a basket.
You'll both follow the policeman.
At the right moment, she'll hand you a revolver.
You just have to pull the trigger."
Let go of me!
Watch me, brothers!
So, you're afraid now!
Look how the organization deals with traitors.
- You bitch! You set me up.
- Careful, the police!
- Now explain!
- If they don't catch us first.
Who sent you?
Take me to him.
- He's waiting.
- Where?
You'll see, if we don't get caught.
You go first.
I'll be right behind you.
What if you were a traitor?
We had to be sure.
- The gun was empty.
- Say you'd been a police spy, the FLN contacts you in prison, you pretend to be for the cause, and the French let you escape.
Then they shoot me?
Blanks.
You escape, go to the address the FLN gives you in prison, and infiltrate us.
And who are you?
Jaffar. El-hadi Jaffar.
To join us you had to do a job.
If I'd told you to kill the bar owner, an Algerian, the cops would've let you kill him even though he's a stoolie.
It wouldn't have proved your loyalty.
If I told you to kill the cop, the French would never have allowed it.
If you had been one of them, you wouldn't have done it.
But I didn't kill him.
No, but you tried.
That's the important thing.
You didn't trust me!
Come on, don't get excited.
I said to shoot him in the back.
No way!
You still don't understand.
Explain it better.
Okay, I'll explain.
First, we need to get organized and secure our hideouts.
Then we can take action.
The organization's getting stronger, but there are still too many drunks, whores, junkies, people who talk too much, people ready to sell us out.
We must win them over or eliminate them.
We need to clean house first, organize the country.
Only then can we take on our real enemy. You understand, Ali?
APRIL 1956
National Liberation Front,
Communiqué No. 24:
People of Algeria, the Colonial Administration is responsible not only for impoverishing our people but also for corrupting and degrading our brothers and sisters, who have lost their sense of dignity.
The FLN is leading a campaign to eradicate this scourge and requests the population's help and cooperation.
This is the first step towards independence.
As of today, the FLN assumes responsibility for the physical and moral well-being of the Algerian people and has therefore decided to ban the sale and use of all drugs and alcoholic beverages and to ban prostitution and procuring.
Offenders will be punished. Repeat offenders will be sentenced to death.
Wino! Wino!
Don't you know drugs are forbidden?
- Why?
- Don't do it again.
Have you seen Hassan El-Blidi?
You seen Hassan El-Blidi?
Tell him I'm looking for him.
Seen Hassan?
If you see Hassan El-Blidi, tell him I'm looking for him.
Ali, where've you been?
- Is Hassan here?
- He left very early. Need something?
If you see him, tell him I'm looking for him.
Ali! How're you doing?
Stay there. Don't move.
- Take it easy.
- I told you not to move.
What are you afraid of?
I fear only God.
What's all this about?
There's nothing between us.
We're friends.
Have you forgotten?
We were friends.
What's happened to you?
You're sentenced to death.
Now I understand.
You've sentenced me to death.
What are they paying you?
Only one thing can save you.
You've been warned twice.
This is your last warning.
What do you mean?
Work for the FLN.
Get lost!
Don't try it! Take a good look.
Things will change in the Casbah.
Take a good look.
We'll clean this place up.
Now beat it!
And watch yourselves.
JUNE 10, 1956
Stay outside and keep watch.
Everything all right?
- Fine.
Be seated.
We'll skip the formalities.
You know why.
The day will come when we will have our weddings in the open.
Remember, we are at war against colonialism.
A strong army has occupied our country for 130 years.
This is why the FLN has to make decisions concerning the civil life of the Algerian people.
With this marriage we fulfill our duty, a duty of resistance.
And now,
Mahmud and Fatiha, come forward.
Sign here.
May God grant you good fortune.
Sign here.
On behalf of the FLN, my sincerest congratulations.
Make yourselves comfortable.
JUNE 20, 1956 - 10:32 A.M.
Come here!
What is it? Calm down.
Come in here.
Hey, Antoine...
Take them in to see the captain.
Yes, sir, but they didn't get a search warrant.
Rue d'lsly?
They followed them some distance but then lost them.
Of course, sir, but that's in your precinct.
It's not their job.
Rue Marengo?
We do have some suspects.
The DA first demands an official request.
Yes, sir.
But I don't have enough men.
I understand.
But if you could...
The prefect can't.
But couldn't you?
Okay.
They can slaughter all of us!
Right.
3:00 p. M:
Attempted attack against a patrol.
Location: Rue Luciani.
Weapon: 7.65mm revolver.
4:00 p. M:
Attack on territorial guard, intersection of rue Consulaire and Avenue Général Laquière.
For Paris, the solution is to put
Algiers under tight police control, guard police stations, close off streets.
I don't agree.
So, Corbière, where were we?
"Intersection of rue Consulaire and Avenue Général Laquière."
The governor general decrees:
Article 1: Purchase of medication for the treatment of gunshot wounds must be authorized by the prefecture.
Article 2:
Health care institutions must keep the police informed of all wounded patients admitted for treatment.
From the prefecture of Algiers:
In recent days, dozens of attacks have taken place in the city.
The perpetrators are known to come from the Muslim quarters.
Each time, they quickly find refuge in these areas.
Consequently, to restore order, the prefect has decided to seal off the Arab quarters.
Checkpoints will be set up at all access points.
Civilians must show ID and may be subject to searches.
In line!
- Going back to the barracks?
- No, I've got two more days.
Don't touch me!
Keep your hands off me!
Never touch their women.
JULY 20, 1956 - 11:20 A.M.
What are you up to?
I'm meeting friends at the beach.
- You still there?
- This is my route.
Come here.
Beat it.
You go that way!
You, this way!
Same old story!
It's the government's fault.
What do they care?
Murder all the bastards!
Then we'll have some peace!
There he is!
I'm sure it's him!
- Where?
- Down there.
Get him!
Murderer! Murderer!
He looks like a dirty fellagha!
Where are you headed?
- Filthy Arab!
- Don't let him get away!
He's getting away! Stop him!
I saw him!
Stop him!
He's getting away!
Culprit: Laknan Abdullah.
Laborer, married, three children.
Address: 8 rue de Thèbes.
How many today?
- Seven attacks, three dead.
One copy for the prefect, the press, the archives and for you.
Thanks. Night, Corbière.
Good night, sir.
Say, Corbière... where's rue de Thèbes?
In the upper Casbah, I think.
Good night, Mommy.
Good night, children.
Fatma, why aren't they in bed?
They're just on their way.
We must get going.
What's your hurry?
You and your card games!
Can't you play here?
- One more for the road?
- Sure, one more.
Sorry, we're already late.
Good night everyone.
Hurry up.
Good-bye, Lucien.
Don't keep Henri up too late.
Get in back.
- Is it far?
- We're almost there.
- Can we go through?
- Too late.
Curfew's already started.
Let us through. He's with me.
Very well, sir. Go on through.
- No. 8, right?
- Yes. Make it snappy.
Murderers! Murderers!
Ali! Stop!
Jaffar says you must stop.
Listen to me, Ali.
Don't go down there.
The army will slaughter us.
Listen to me.
- Get out of here!
Halt!
Stay calm!
The FLN will avenge you!
The FLN will avenge you!
Stand guard on the roof.
You, come in.
- Is this all right?
- Fine.
Fine.
No good? Listen.
I'll take my son. It'll work.
Okay, but use the rue du Divan checkpoint. It's easier there.
Then meet up with the others.
Air France, rue Mauritania.
The café, rue Michelet.
The milk bar, rue d'lsly.
The bomb timers are short.
They'll be set outside the Casbah.
Taleb is waiting for you at the fish market.
But then you must hurry.
You only have 30 minutes to place them.
Good luck.
God be with you.
Halt!
- Your papers.
- I forgot them.
- Over there. Move it!
- They're at home.
Let me go get them!
- Get back.
- I'm in a hurry.
I said wait!
Get back or no one goes through.
- Let me through.
- Wait there.
- It's not fair.
- I said wait.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.
May I go through, sir?
- Go ahead.
Excuse me.
It's all right.
Hands up.
Go on, madam.
Go on.
I'll only be an hour.
He's a good boy.
Thank you.
Going to the beach, miss?
- How'd you know?
- Oh, I just guessed.
Care for some company?
Not today. I'm meeting friends.
What a shame!
Maybe another time?
Who knows?
Good luck.
A Coke, please.
Would you like to sit down?
One hundred francs.
Leaving, miss?
What a pity.
Attention, please.
Flight 432 to Paris will be delayed for 20 minutes.
Care for another martini?
What's going on?
A propane tank must've exploded.
The paratroopers are here!
JANUARY 10, 1957
Jean Charrot, Inspector General on special assignment, presided over a special meeting convened to organize the fight against rebel activity.
Major decisions were made concerning the maintenance of law and order and the protection of persons and private property.
General Carelle of the 10th Airborne Division will be in charge of maintaining order in Algiers.
He will command all civil and military forces and exercise special powers by official decree.
Mathieu, Philippe.
Born August 5, 1907, in Bordeaux.
Rank: Lieutenant colonel.
Campaigns: Italy and Normandy.
Member of an anti-Nazi resistance movement.
Expeditions: Madagascar and Suez.
Wars: Indochina and Algeria.
So we now average
4.2 attacks a day.
We must distinguish between attacks on individuals and bombings.
As usual, the problem involves:
First, the adversary, and second, the means to destroy him.
There are 400,000 Arabs in Algiers.
Are they all our enemies?
We know they're not.
But a small minority holds sway by means of terror and violence.
We must deal with this minority in order to isolate and destroy it.
It's a dangerous enemy that works in the open and underground, using tried-and-true revolutionary methods as well as original tactics.
It's a faceless enemy, unrecognizable, blending in with hundreds of others.
It is everywhere. In cafés, in the alleys of the Casbah, or in the very streets of the European quarter.
This footage was taken by the police with cameras hidden around Casbah checkpoints.
The police thought it might come in handy, and indeed it does, to show the futility of certain methods, or at least their drawbacks.
I deliberately chose footage taken shortly before a number of recent terrorist attacks.
Among all these Arab men and women are the perpetrators.
But who are they?
How can we recognize them?
ID checks are ludicrous.
If anyone's papers are in order, it's the terrorist's.
Note the cameraman's hunch.
He's sure there's something in that box.
And his film provides us with the details.
There might have been a false bottom with a bomb inside.
We'll never know.
That's enough, Martin.
We have to start from scratch.
The only information we have concerns the organization's structure.
Let's start from there.
It's a pyramid organization made up of a series of sections.
These sections, in turn, are made up of triangles.
At the apex is the Executive Bureau.
The military head of the Executive Bureau finds a competent person and names him section head: No. 1.
No. 1 finds two others:
Nos. 2 and 3.
This makes up the first triangle.
Now Nos. 2 and 3 each select two men:
Nos. 4,
5, 6 and 7.
The reason for these geometrics is that each organization member knows only three other members:
The one who chose him and the two he himself chose.
Contact is made only in writing.
That's why we don't know our adversaries.
Because, in point of fact, they don't know each other.
To know them is to eliminate them.
Consequently, the purely military aspect of the problem is secondary.
More important is the policing aspect.
I know you dislike that word.
But it's the only one that describes the work at hand.
We must investigate to reconstruct the pyramid and identify the Executive Bureau.
The basis of our job is intelligence.
The method: Interrogation.
Conducted in such a way as to ensure we always get an answer.
In our situation, humane considerations can only lead to despair and confusion.
I'm sure all units will understand and act accordingly.
Unfortunately, success doesn't depend only on us.
The city must be at our disposal.
We must comb it thoroughly and question all inhabitants.
But that's where we run into the maze of laws still in force, as if Algiers were a holiday resort and not a battlefield.
We've requested a free hand, but it's hard to obtain.
So we need an occasion that will justify our intervention and make it possible.
We ourselves must create this occasion.
Unless our adversary provides us with one, as it seems to be doing now.
To all militants:
After two years of bitter struggle in the cities and in the mountains, the Algerian people have won a great victory.
On Monday, January 28, the United Nations will open debate on the Algerian question.
Our entire organization will mobilize to explain this event's importance.
Beginning Monday, the FLN is calling a week-long general strike.
During this period, all armed action will be suspended.
Le Monde! Week-long strike!
The money, please.
We did it!
People of Algeria, colonial powers, failing to block
UN debate on the Algerian question, will attempt to demonstrate that the FLN represents only a minority.
World opinion is with us.
Let us show our unity.
Support the strike proclaimed by the FLN.
During this entire week, stay away from European quarters.
Do not leave the Casbah.
Avoid gathering in closed places, as this will facilitate raids.
Give shelter to the poor and homeless.
Stock up on food and water for a week.
- They seem calm.
- But you can feel something's up.
Like rabbits in a cage.
Just as I hoped.
Think they'll obey the order to strike?
I think so.
- Is it going the way you wanted?
- I hope so.
What are you calling the operation?
Well, General...
DRINK CHAMPAGNE
- "Operation Champagne."
- Why not?
Operation Champagne it is.
The homeless, the unemployed, the beggars.
We've arranged for them to stay with families during the strike.
That way they'll be safe from police raids.
But I don't think they should have been brought here.
It's a mistake.
- Why?
You're here. We'd better move you somewhere else.
- Don't you trust them?
- I do, but you never know.
All right. You're in charge.
If I were in charge, you wouldn't be in Algiers now.
- Duty first?
- Caution is best.
Ali, take Ben M'Hidi to the Maison des Arbres.
Isn't he staying here?
No. Go with him.
I'll wait for you to come back.
What do you think?
How's this for a hideout?
Looks like a wall.
Take a look inside.
Not now. It's late.
Si Ben M'Hidi,
I'll be in touch tomorrow.
Ali, go first.
Cut through the mosque.
The coast is clear.
We can't do anything for a week.
What do you think of the strike?
I think it'll succeed.
I think so, too.
It's been well organized.
What will the French do?
Obviously, they'll try everything to break it.
They'll do more than that, because we've given them an opportunity.
You know what I mean?
Now they'll no longer be groping in the dark.
Every striker will be a recognizable enemy.
A certified criminal.
The French will take the offensive.
Understand what I mean?
- Yes.
Jaffar says you weren't in favor of the strike.
- No, I wasn't.
- Why not?
Because we were ordered not to use arms.
Acts of violence don't win wars.
Neither wars nor revolutions.
Terrorism is useful as a start.
But then, the people themselves must act.
That's the rationale behind this strike.
To mobilize all Algerians, to assess our strength.
To prove it to the UN?
Yes, to prove it to the UN.
It may not do any good, but at least the UN will be able to gauge our strength.
You know, Ali, it's hard enough to start a revolution, even harder to sustain it, and hardest of all to win it.
But it's only afterwards, once we've won, that the real difficulties begin.
In short, there's still much to do.
You're not tired, Ali?
No.
Wake up!
Everybody out!
You bastards!
We'll teach you to strike!
Attention all vehicles!
Load the requisitioned workers!
Truck No. 1 to El Biar.
No. 2, the gasworks.
No. 3, the docks.
Attention!
Dispatch all suspects to headquarters.
That one.
You, come here. Stop.
On strike, are you?
- I'm sick.
You're too scared to admit it.
Admit you're with the FLN.
You're one of them.
Take me for an idiot?
Think I can't tell?
The FLN wants you to strike and you won't talk? You dirty Arab!
Suit yourself.
Gérard, take him away.
- Come with me.
- Are you deaf?
Everyone back to work!
Get a move on!
Day four:
The general strike continues.
All activity has come to a halt.
No serious incident has been reported.
All is quiet in the Muslim quarter.
I'll call you back.
Mathieu's here.
- Some questions...
- I'm meeting with the prefect.
- What's going on?
- I'm just assessing the situation.
Go and see for yourselves.
You're free to move around.
- The strike seems successful.
- It missed its main target.
Insurrection?
That isn't the aim.
- You believe the FLN?
It's plausible this time.
A strike might convince the UN.
The UN is far away.
How can it gauge a strike's magnitude?
Bombs would be more practical.
That would be my choice.
What would armed insurrection mean now?
What it always means: An inevitable phase in revolutionary warfare.
After terrorism comes armed insurrection.
Just as guerrilla warfare leads to warfare proper.
Dien Bien Phu?
Exactly.
But in Indochina they won.
- And here?
- That depends on you.
On us?
You intend to sign us up?
God forbid! Just do your reporting and do it well.
It's not warriors we need.
- Then what?
Political will, which is sometimes there and sometimes isn't.
Sometimes it's not enough.
What did Paris say yesterday?
Nothing. Another article by Sartre.
Why are the Sartres always born on the other side?
Then you like Sartre?
No, but I like him even less as a foe.
Come with me.
Move it.
- What's that?
- The dance hall.
Let's get it over with.
Repeat what you said and you can go.
Name?
- Smain.
- First name?
- Ahmed.
- Section?
- Second section.
- Be more precise.
- Second section.
Casbah, Algiers West.
- Which group?
- Third group.
- What was your role?
- Head of the sixth cell.
That'll do.
DAY SIX OF THE STRIKE
People of the Casbah, the FLN wants to stop you from working.
The FLN is forcing you to close your shops.
The FLN wants to starve you and condemn you to poverty.
The FLN wants to stop you from working.
People of the Casbah,
France is your motherland.
Mohammed! Mohammed!
Have you seen him?
The FLN wants to starve you and condemn you to poverty.
People of the Casbah, resist the FLN's orders.
Thank God you're home.
God bless you, my children.
Have you seen my brother Said?
Algerians! Brothers! Take heart!
The FLN tells you not to be afraid!
Don't worry, we're winning.
The FLN is on your side.
Long live Algeria!
FEBRUARY 5, 1957
FINAL DAY OF THE STRIKE
Open the shop.
Go on!
Faster!
The UN General Assembly, all motions having failed to obtain a majority, has passed a resolution ruling out any direct intervention in Algeria.
The UN, however, hopes that in a spirit of cooperation, a peaceful, democratic and fair solution will be found in keeping with the principles of the UN charter.
Good. Well done.
Now we can go turn in.
The end of the strike changes nothing.
Instructions remain the same.
Give your boys the usual orders.
We must occupy the Casbah
24 hours a day.
We must continue our work here, without respite.
Any of you ever suffer from tapeworm?
It's a worm that can grow infinitely.
You can destroy its thousands of segments but as long as the head remains, it rebuilds and proliferates.
The FLN is similarly organized.
The head is the Executive Bureau.
Several persons.
As long as they're not eliminated, we're back to zero.
Here are four of them.
I found these in the police records.
I had the snapshots blown up.
Si Murad.
Ramel.
Jaffar.
Ali La Pointe.
Print up a thousand copies and distribute them to our men.
Who else lives here?
I told you. My daughter upstairs, and my husband, who's at work.
Okay, Pierre. Let's go.
They're gone.
There were ten this time.
- Paratroopers?
- Yes.
Did a traitor bring them here?
They came alone.
They asked questions.
They didn't hurt anyone.
Jibela Malika has been arrested.
Sheik Abdullah has been arrested...
People of the Casbah, the FLN has lost the battle.
Stand up to its dying authority.
Work with us to build a new Algeria.
Mujid Ben Ali has been arrested.
- What's wrong?
- They arrested him.
Take courage.
We'll split up.
We must change our hideouts.
We must reestablish our contacts.
We must replace those arrested and killed and reorganize our groups.
We have to make our presence felt.
That'll come later.
No. Right now.
Leave it to me.
No. None of us will do anything.
We have to resist as much as we can, without giving the enemy a chance to catch us. Agreed?
We have to do something.
That's why we must reestablish our contacts first.
- How do we move?
- I'll take care of that.
I'll be out in three months.
Hey, look!
Quick, hide us!
We're being followed.
Where? On the terrace?
Come in, brothers.
God protect you.
Hide in the well.
God be with you.
They're gone. Wait until I call.
Then you can come up.
Thank you.
The first section's dead.
There's no one left.
We lost contact with the second.
The third is reorganizing.
All that's left is the fourth.
It's enough to start over with.
FEBRUARY 25, 1957
Bastard!
You'll pay for the others!
Keep calm! Get back!
MARCH 4, 1957
No more photographs.
Mr. Ben M'Hidi, isn't it cowardly to use your women's baskets to carry bombs, which have taken so many innocent lives?
Isn't it even more cowardly to attack defenseless villages with napalm bombs that kill many thousands of times more?
Obviously, planes would make things easier for us.
Give us your bombers, sir, and you can have our baskets.
The FLN has more of a chance of defeating the French army than the French have of changing the course of history.
According to a declaration by Colonel Mathieu, you were arrested by chance.
Practically by mistake.
The paratroopers were looking for someone less important than you.
Can you tell us why you were in that apartment on rue Debussy?
All I can say is
I wish I'd never set foot there.
That'll be all.
It's late and we have work to do.
So the show's over?
Yes, it's over.
Before it has the opposite effect.
People of the Casbah, the rebellion is dying out.
Ali Mohammed, head of
FLN Section 2, was killed this morning.
People of Algiers, turn in the agitators.
Disassociate yourselves from the rebel organization.
The army is protecting you.
Trust in it.
Colonel Mathieu, the spokesman for the Resident Minister, Mr. Gorlin, states that Larbi Ben M'Hidi hanged himself in his cell using strips of his shirt that he made into a rope and tied to the bars of his window.
Given his stated intention to escape at the first opportunity, it was thought necessary to keep the prisoner bound hand and foot at all times.
In your opinion, Colonel, in such a condition, can a man tear his shirt up, make a rope out of it, and hang himself from a window?
Ask the spokesman about that.
I didn't make such a statement.
For my part, I had the chance to appreciate the moral fiber, courage and commitment of Ben M'Hidi to his own ideals.
And so, notwithstanding the great danger he represented,
I pay tribute to his memory.
There's been a lot of talk, not only of the paratroopers' success, but also of the methods they're said to use.
Can you comment on this?
Their success is the result of these methods.
One depends on the other.
Excuse me, Colonel.
It seems to be that, perhaps out of an excess of caution, my colleagues keep asking you indirect questions to which you can only reply in a roundabout way.
It would be better to call... a spade a spade.
So let's talk about torture.
I understand.
And you? Have you no question?
They've all been asked.
I'd just like more precise answers.
Let's try to be precise.
The word "torture" isn't used in our orders.
We use interrogation as the only valid police method against clandestine activity.
The FLN asks all its members, in case of capture, to remain silent for 24 hours.
Then they may talk.
This gives the FLN time to render any information useless.
And us? What form of questioning must we adopt?
Civil law procedures, which take months for a mere misdemeanor?
Legality can be inconvenient.
Is it legal to set off bombs in public places?
Remember Ben M'Hidi's answer when you asked him the question.
No, gentlemen, believe me.
It's a vicious circle.
We could talk for hours to no avail, because that isn't the problem.
The problem is this:
The FLN wants to throw us out of Algeria, and we want to stay.
Even with slight shades of opinion, you all agree that we must stay.
When the FLN rebellion began, there were no shades at all.
Every paper, the communist press included, wanted it crushed.
We're here for that reason alone.
We're neither madmen nor sadists.
Those who call us fascists forget the role many of us played in the Resistance.
Those who call us Nazis don't know that some of us survived
Dachau and Buchenwald.
We are soldiers.
Our duty is to win.
Therefore, to be precise, it's my turn to ask a question.
Should France stay in Algeria?
If your answer is still yes, then you must accept all the consequences.
A doctor!
He's been stabbed!
I'm out of ammo!
Look there!
Run them down!
AUGUST 26, 1957
Make way for the colonel.
There's no point playing the hero.
Hand me the megaphone.
Ramel. Si Murad.
Listen:
I wouldn't want to be in your shoes when you're captured.
You know we'll get you.
Surrender and you won't be harmed.
You'll get a fair trial.
Do you hear?
- Who's speaking?
Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
We don't trust you.
Come closer.
Let us see you.
Why don't you trust me?
Stand up so that we can see you.
Keep your hands still and in sight.
But we want the promise of a fair trial in writing.
Give us a written promise.
Then we'll surrender.
How do I get it to you?
We'll lower our guns in a basket.
Fair enough.
I'm make this statement in writing.
Finished?
Yes, finished.
- Ready, Mathieu?
- Yes, but let's see you first.
We can see them now.
Go ahead.
Here.
You know that when I give my word,
I keep it.
The bastard! He got away!
Faster, dirty Arab!
Take this, you dog!
Burn all the papers.
SEPTEMBER 24, 1957
Don't leave a trace.
Which of you is Zakia?
You?
Go tell Jaffar to surrender or we'll blow up the house and everyone in it.
Try to convince him if you want to keep your house.
Got that?
Wait. You'll get yourself killed.
Jaffar!
Zakia's coming up.
I wouldn't shoot if I were you.
Go on now.
Jaffar.
Listen to me.
They say if you don't come down, they'll blow up the house.
You can tell them to blow up whatever they want.
Go tell them!
He says he won't surrender, that you can blow it all up.
All right. Join the others.
Prepare the explosives.
Get as close as possible, but don't take risks.
Use a long fuse, then cut it.
Give them cover while they work.
You, keep your eyes open.
Anything can happen, as we know.
It's really pointless to die like this.
Mathieu! If you give me your word not to hurt anyone in this house, we'll come down.
I'd have hated to blow you all up.
Why?
Your picture and your file have been on my desk for months.
I have the feeling I know you a bit.
You don't strike me as the kind for empty gestures.
You seem satisfied to have me alive.
Yes, I am.
I thought you'd regret it.
I gave you an unexpected advantage.
No, only the satisfaction of having had the right hunch.
Technically speaking, we can't talk about advantages.
The game's over.
Monster! Hypocrite! You're wrong.
Ali La Pointe is still in the Casbah.
What's she saying?
She says Ali La Pointe is still free.
- Come in.
- I'm coming.
You're tired. Go rest.
Omar, go to bed.
We have a job tomorrow.
Myself, Mahmud, Hassiba... and you.
There's no one else left.
Sadek will drive.
You get out, plant the bomb, and come back fast.
Be sure they don't follow you.
Then we'll get out.
Hassiba first, then Mahmud.
I'll see to the rest.
Wake up.
Sleep well?
Get ready to go.
- Is it time?
- Almost.
Hassiba!
- I'm ready.
I heard a truck.
So did I. But if it was Sadek, he'd be here by now.
- How's your wife?
- She's fine.
Inside!
Outside!
On your feet!
Well?
All ready.
I had the house evacuated.
- Has he answered?
- Absolute silence.
I thought as much.
Ali La Pointe!
At least let the others out, or you'll all be blown up.
The boy will just go to the reformatory for a while.
Why let him die?
He's still here?
Take him away.
Ali... Ali La Pointe!
You have another 30 seconds.
What are you hoping for?
Anyway, you've lost.
Think hard. Thirty seconds.
Thirty seconds from now.
Whoever wants to can go.
- What'll you do?
- I don't trust them.
You four stay here.
Come down when I give the signal.
- Everything ready?
- All ready, sir.
Stand back.
You two cover him and be careful.
You never know.
The tapeworm's headless now.
Satisfied, Mathieu?
- Yes, sir.
- The FLN is decapitated in Algiers.
- We'll hear no more of it.
At least for the time being.
- Forever, let's hope.
They're basically decent people.
We got on fine for 130 years.
Why shouldn't it continue?
- But Algiers isn't all of Algeria.
No, Algiers isn't all Algeria.
True, but for now let's settle for Algiers.
Things are much easier in the mountains.
Good-bye, sir.
Good-bye, Mathieu.
I'll see you this afternoon.
Yes, sir.
DECEMBER 11, 1960
For some unknown reason, due to some obscure motive, after two years of relative quiet, with the war contained mostly in the mountains, disturbances broke out again without warning, and nobody knows why or how.
I phoned Tunis.
I spoke to an exiled FLN chief, but he knows nothing either.
Long live Algeria!
This morning, for the first time, out came flags with crescent and star.
Thousands of flags, probably made overnight.
"Flags" is hardly the word.
More like torn sheets, shirts, rags - but flags nevertheless.
We're marching for freedom!
The situation is more tense today.
Despite pressure from the most rigid colonialists, the government had given orders not to open fire except as a last resort.
Attempts were made this afternoon to descend into the European quarter.
There were several casualties, but things seem to have calmed down.
The Muslim quarters still echo with those unintelligible and frightening rhythmic cries.
The surprising unity of these demonstrations has made a deep impression on French public opinion.
According to Paris, a significant segment of the political class is in favor of seeking a new relationship with Algeria.
DECEMBER 21, 1960
LAST DAY OF DEMONSTRATIONS
Listen to me!
Return to your homes!
What do you want?
Independence!
Our pride!
We want our freedom!
Two more years of struggle still lay ahead.
Then, on July 2, 1962, with its independence, the Algerian nation was born.

Uh, Good morning, young ladies and gentlemen.
[Door opening]
Good morning, visitors.
For our science lesson for today,
We will continue our discussion of Darwin's theory of the descent of man.
Now, as I told you yesterday,
Darwin's theory tells us that man evolved from a lower order of animals, from the first wiggly protozoa here in the sea to the ape and finally to man.
Say now some of you fellas out there are probably going to that's why some of us act like monkeys.
[Laughing]
But what Mr. Charles Darwin was trying to tell us, in his own way--
Bertram T. Cates come off it, Sam.
You've known me all my life.
Bert, you're charged with violation of public act 31428, volume 37, statute no. 31428 of the state code, which makes it unlawful for any teacher of the public schools to teach any theory that denies the creation of man as taught in the bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from the lower order of animals.
Bertram Cates, I hereby place you under arrest.
Monkey trial!
Here's another one--
"Monkey shines in Hillsboro."
The whole world's laughing at us.
Look, from Chicago--
"Heavenly Hillsboro--
"does it have a hole in its head."
"or its head in a hole"
I'm telling you, we've gone too far.
Let 'em laugh. we're fightin' the lord's battle, ain't we, Reverend.
Well, I'd a sight rather have some heathen a-laughin' at me than to have my sons a-laughin' at my bible.
Well, they mocked the lord, too, didn't they and they smote him and they spat upon him, and he turned to them his other cheek.
Amen.
Look, Reverend, we don't want to smite 'em back.
We just want to make 'em stop.
Tom, you're prosecuting attorney.
Isn't there something we can do?
Well, in view of my position,
I...hardly think it ethical for me to express my opinion then you'd better go back to law school.
Gentlemen, I ask you-- what do we care what a bunch of foreigners and city slickers think
Frank, you ever had a frenchman stayin' at your hotel
Now look, you're missing the-- and how long since you sold a pound of grits to some smart aleck from New York
Heaven has chosen us to show the way, to light the road for others, back to the shepherd, back to the fold.
We're not sheep, Reverend.
Well, I'd a sight rather be a sheep than a Judas goat.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
As mayor of Hillsboro,
I stand to uphold the laws of this community,
No Matter how it may affect my political future.
Now, I shall just ignore these-- these slanders just like water off a duck's back.
Now look, you only got 2 months more to go as mayor anyway, and you shouldn't have been elected in the first place.
You've been a lousy mayor.
[Everyone talking at once]
My friends, as you all know, I deal with figures-- accounts, checks, balances.
My bank operates on the principle of practical reality and so do I.
Are you aware, my friends, that the great big universities throughout the country will consider student applicants from our state ineligible because of this law
Now, I don't know whose idea it was to hang a shingle on Hillsboro spelling "horse-and-buggy," but as for me, I won't invest in antiquity.
I want my bank holding credit with New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and I may want my son to go to Yale.
Now, I believe in-- just as much as anyone in this room-- in a basic fundamentalist interpretation of the bible, but we can't close our eyes to all progress, to everything which represents--
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
"Matthew Harrison Brady volunteers to prosecute in monkey trial."
Matthew Harrison Brady. the lord has sent us his right hand. and I'll be working with him.
They'll come pouring out of the hills.
This town will fill up like a rain barrel in a flood.
It'll be bigger than the Chautauqua at Chattanooga,
And people are gonna have to have some place to stay... and they gotta eat.
This'll put Hillsboro on the map of this country.
Let us give thanks to the lord.
Let us pray.
You better start praying, son. imagine-- Matthew Harrison Brady coming here.
I voted for him for president,
Twice-- once in 1900 and again in 08
I wasn't old enough to vote for him the first time he run, but my Pa did.
I seen him once at a Chautauqua meeting in Chattanooga.
When he spoke, the tent poles shook.
Who's going to be your lawyer, son
I don't know yet.
I wrote to that newspaper in Baltimore. they're sending somebody. well, he better be loud.
[Knocking at door]
Ahh, probably one of those newspaper reporters.
You're a popular fellow.
Yeah.
Oh, Bert, you don't mind, do you.
Just for the looks of it
Can't tell who it might be.
Sure. Don't worry about it, Mort.
[Knocking]
[Knocking]
All right,
All right.
[Knocking]
Who is it
[Woman] Mort
Rachel.
Come on in.
Ahh, you got a present for Bert, huh
Mort, don't let my father know
I came here.
Well, the Reverend don't tell me his business.
I don't see why I should tell him mine
Is Bert all right
Oh, of course he's--
The safest place in the world's in the jail.
Come on in. Come on.
Tell them you're sorry.
Tell them it was all a mistake.
Please te-- tell them if they let my body out of jail
I'd lock up my mind
Could you stand that, Rachel at least we'd be together.
It wouldn't be the...
It wouldn't be the same.
Rachel, do you remember those warm, dark nights down by the riverbank, just watching the water, wondering about the...the miracle of it, wondering what the stars were for... what's on the other side of the moon
There'd be no more of that, Rach.
We could still have that.
No, we couldn't.
That would be in the locked-off part... for both of us.
[Man]
Well...
So, this is where the fate of learning will be decided for the next 10,000 years.
O tempora, o mores.
Well, I see we have both beauty and biology on our side.
Who are you
This your writing
Yes.
This is mine.
Hornbeck. E.K. Hornbeck,
Baltimore Herald.
I've been waiting to hear from you.
Read it.
My typewriter's been singing a sweet, sad song about the
Hillsboro heretic--
B. Cates, latter-Day Dreyfus
Ok. Romeo with a biology bo want a bite
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not the serpent, little eva.
This isn't from the tree of knowledge.
Oh, no.
You won't find one growing in "Heavenly Hillsboro."
A few ignorance bushes, perhaps, but no tree of knowledge.
Ask adam.
You make me sound like a martyr.
You could be.
Martyrs always have a point to prove, and so do you, but you haven't won your halo yet. that won't come until they've tossed you into the arena... with the lion.
You mean Brady
I don't want Bert to be a martyr.
What are you trying to prove, anyway
Rach, I'm not trying to prove anything.
All I want to do is teach my students that man just wasn't planted here like a Geranium in a flowerpot that life comes from a long miracle.
It just didn't take 7 days.
But it's against the law. a schoolteacher's a public servant.
He should do what the law and the school board want him to.
Has the accused anything to say in his own defense
If not, I sentence you to life as a public servant, a silent butler in the service of your school board.
Wastebaskets for ideas on sale in the outer lobby.
I don't see anything funny in this, Mr. Hornbeck.
Objection sustained. 
Neither do I.
Then why don't you just leave us alone
You newspaper people have stirred up enough trouble for Bert. what do you want, anyway
I came to tell boy Socrates here that the Baltimore Herald is opposed to Hemlock, and will provide a lawyer.
Who
Who
I don't know yet, but what's the difference
A new lawyer with old tricks,
An old lawyer with new tricks.
Wake up, Copernicus.
The law is still on the side of the lawmakers, and everything revolves around their terra firma.
Then why bother, you and your newspaper
Because I know that the sunrise is an optical illusion.
My teacher told me so.
You don't seem like the kind of person who'd want to bother.
You seem so-- cynical.
True, true
That's part of my fascination
I do hateful things for which people love me and I do lovable things for which they hate me.
I'm admired for my detestability.
Now, don't worry, little Eva.
I may be rancid butter, but I'm on your side of the bread.

Matthew Harrison Brady... as mayor of Hillsboro, may I say that this municipality is proud to have within its city limits the warrior who has always fought for us ordinary people.
Why the lady folk of this town would not have the vote
If it hadn't been for you fighting
To give them all that suffrage.
Mr. President Wilson would not have got to the white house and won the war
If it hadn't been for you supporting him and being his secretary of state
In conclusion, the governor of our glorious state has vested in me the authority to confer upon you a commission as honorary colonel in the state militia.
[Cheering]
If it's good enough for Brady...
If it's good enough for Brady then it's good enough for me
[Cheering]
Col. Brady--
I like the sound of that.
[Crowd chuckling]
Friends, Mrs. Brady and I are delighted to be among you.
We all voted for you-- 3 times!
I trust it was in 3 separate elections.
[Crowd laughing]
I could only wish for one thing-- that you had not given us quite so warm a welcome.
[Laughing]
[Women's voice]
Mr. Brady
Mr. Brady
Yes
Here you are.
Oh, bless you, bless you.
And Mrs. Brady.
Thank you.
And now then,
Who, may I ask, is the, uh, spiritual leader of the community
The Rev.
Jeremiah Brown
Go on,
Reverend.
How are you, Reverend
Will you stand here at my side thank you.
Ahem.
My friends of Hillsboro,
You know why I have come here.
It is not merely to prosecute a lawbreaker, a young man who has spoken out against the revealed word.
I have come here because what has happened in a schoolroom in your town has unloosed a wicked attack from the big cities of the north.
We did not seek this struggle.
We are simple folk, who seek only to live in brotherhood and peace, to cherish our loved ones, to teach our children the ways of righteousness and of the lord.
But what would they teach them, these idolaters, these priests of "evil-ution" what would they have them do they would have them measure the distance between the stars and forget him who holds the stars in his hands. they are lost, my friends.
For, I tell you, if man believes he is descended from the beasts, he must remain a beast! and as the young wolf turns upon the old, these innocent ones, corrupted and despairing of salvation, will turn upon their fathers, and our land will become a land of sodom and gomorrah of pestilence, of fire, of hatred and of death.
I disagree.
[Crowd murmuring]
Who are you
Uh, Hornbeck.
E.K. Hornbeck of the Baltimore Herald.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, I know your paper... and your writings, Sir.
Ladies and gentlemen my paper is happy to announce that it is sending two representatives to, uh, "Heavenly Hillsboro"-- the most gifted reporter in America today--
Myself--
[Crowd laughing] and the most agile legal mind of the 20th century--
Henry Drummond.
[Crowd murmuring]
[man] who's Henry Drummond
We'll send him back to hell! ride him out on a rail!
Don't let him into town!
Keep him out!
[Everyone yelling]
No, no, no.
I believe we should welcome Henry Drummond.
If the enemy sends his goliath into battle, it magnifies our cause.
Henry Drummond has stalked the courtrooms of this land for 40 years.
When he fights, headlines follow.
The whole world will be watching our victory over Drummond.
If st. george had killed a dragonfly instead of a dragon, who would remember him
[Laughing]
We here in Hillsboro have not only the opportunity to slay the devil's disciple but the devil himself!
If it's good enough for Brady... if it's good enough for Brady if it's good enough for Brady if it's good enough for Brady then it's good enough for me
Oh, give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough for me
Oh, give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
You're the stranger, ain't you are you looking for a nice, clean place to stay
I had a nice, clean place to stay, madam, and I left it to come here.
If it's good enough for Brady
If it's good enough for Brady if it's good enough for Brady then it's good enough for me
[Playing organ]
Rachel.
I waited supper for you. it's on the table peace will come, my daughter.
God we must thank that the sinner stands naked and exposed.
Stop preaching, Pa.
I have something to tell you.
You're upset, daughter.
Eat something and we'll talk in the morning.
No. Now. I'm not leaving Bert.
I don't understand.
You heard what Mr. Brady said
I love him, Pa. I love him.
No, no. that is the love of Judas.
This man has nothing to offer you but sin.
I told you that from the beginning. what's he done what's he done that's so terrible
Why do you hate him so
Because I love god, and I hate his enemies.
Bert loves God.
Then what is he doing with Henry Drummond
Why is he bringing Henry Drummond here to spew his atheistic filth into the ears of our people
You're a schoolteacher.
You know how easy it is to mold minds for good or to twist them for evil.
Bert didn't twist any minds.
You're infected with the poison of his agnosticism.
Now get down on your knees and pray for forgiveness.
Forgiveness for what 
Because you have betrayed me.
You have betrayed your faith.
I'm not betraying anybody.
I'm glad your mother isn't here to see what's become of you.
Pa, please listen to me.
If she is looking down from heaven,
I ask her to forgive you and to forgive me.
Pa, ever since I was a little girl,
I'd wake up in the middle of the night afraid of the dark, like the house was upside down, and if I didn't hang onto the Mattress,
I'd fall out into the sky--
Forgive her, Mother,
Forgive her, dear God...
I wanted to run to you, to have you tell me that I was safe, that everything was all right, but I was always more afraid of you than of falling.
It's the same way now.
I have failed.
Tell me what to do, dear lord.
Guide my faltering steps.
Pa. Pa.
I love my daughter. how can I save her
Pa, get up. Please get up.
And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean.
From all your filthiness and from your idols
Will I cleanse you and a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit put within you, and I will tear out the stony heart of flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
[Sobbing]
[Band playing that old time religion]
Hello, devil. Welcome to hell.
Hello, Hornbeck.
Hillsboro, Heavenly Hillsboro
The buckle on the bible belt
Come on.
Where are we staying
--we're sharing a room at the mansion house like everything else in this town, misnamed
Follow me, and I shall point out the unplumbed and plumbing-less depths.
Bible
Bible
Hot dogs.
Here y'are. Get your red hots.
That poses a pretty problem.
Which is hungrier-- my stomach or my soul
Hot dog.
Yes, sir.
Tell me, uh, what do you think of all these monkeyshines
Got no opinion, sir. Opinions are bad for business.
Ah.
Are you a evolutionist
A infidel
A sinner the worst kind.
I write for a newspaper.
Want a hot dog
No, thanks.
Oh, then you, sir, you must be a man of God.
No, no, no. ulcers
Ladies and gentlemen, devolution is not a theory but a proven fact.
My friends, man did not evolve from the ape, but the ape devolved from man.
Now, you take a look at this creature sitting here.
There before you is an example of the ungrace to which man can fall because of his own bestiality.
Look at those beady little brows.
Look at those shifting eyes.
For as sure as the good lord cast out satan from heavenly glory, so did he devolve this poor beast from man.
Quit looking at me, will you, son
These are the wages of sin, my friends.
You take a lesson.
Look and beware.
I thank you.
Your contributions will be gratefully received.
Grandpa.
Welcome to Hillsboro, sir.
Have you come to testify for the prosecution or the defense
You.
You Henry Drummond
Yes, I am.
I'm royce mcHenry, farmer hereabouts.
Nice to know you, Mr. mcHenry.
I want to tell you we're just plain folk down here.
We don't need no outsiders to tell us how or what to think.
Well, that isn't my mission, Mr. McHenry.
Then why don't you go back where you came from
Hmm.
Pretty hot, aren't they
Their Messiah arrived yesterday.
Look, uh, Drummond,
Why don't you give your ulcers a break and go home
You'll win no victories here.
I've been a lawyer long enough to know there are no total victories anywhere
Hm. there's only one man in this town who thinks at all, and he's in jail.
That's why I'm here.
Just, uh, plain folk, 2nd generation.
Mr. Drummond
We're all members of Mr. Cates' homeroom and biology class.
..w-we all like Mr. Cates very much.
And we hope you do right by him.
Well, so do i, son. so do i.
Sarah!
It's good to see you, Henry.
I only wish it were under different circumstances.
Sarah, you look lovelier than ever
Oh, uh, you know Mr. Hornbeck
How do you do, Mrs. Brady
How do you do, Mr. Hornbeck
Ha ha!
Excuse me.
HHenry! Henry Drummond!
How are you, Henry
Hello, Matt.
I see you've made friends among the younger set.
Yes, youth appeals to me these days.
[Concierge]
Room 206, Mr. Drummond.
Thank you.
Neither of us is getting any younger, eh Henry
Matt, you know what the doctor said about not overeating in this heat.
Don't worry, mother.
We need strength for the fight ahead.
I'll take up your bags, counselor.
Thank you.
Oh, it's you again, Mr. Hornbeck.
I read your article yesterday.
Very biased reporting, I must say.
Mr. Brady, it's the duty of a newspaper to comfort the afflicted... and afflict the comfortable.
I don't like that fellow.
Oh. Henry, I'd like for you to meet some of the good, uh, people of Hillsboro.
Mr. Carter, the mayor.
Welcome to Hillsboro. thank you, your honor.
Prosecuting attorney for this, ah, this district,
Mr. Davenport.
We'll be working together.
Mr. Drummond, sir, let me assure you, while we may not agree with your ideas, we respect your right to voice them.
Good boy.
[Brady]
Henry Drummond and I have worked side by side in a good many battles for the rights of the common folk of this country.
Twice he campaigned for me when I ran for president.
Isn't that right, Henry
That's right, Matt.
Now, after all these years,
We find ourselves on the opposite side of an issue.
Well, that's evolution for you.
Good day, gentlemen.
Good day, young gentlemen, and--and thank you.
Sarah.
Good-bye,
Henry.
[Band playing that old time religion]
[Crowd cheering]
[Crowd booing]
[Band playing funeral dirge]
I believe we can desist with the taking of photographs for the time being.
Mr. drummond, is the defense ready to proceed with the selecti on of the next juror
Defense is ready, your honor.
Col. Brady, is the prosecution ready?
Prosecution is ready, your honor.
All right, Mort, call a venireman to fill the 12th and last seat on the jury.
Ap! Jessie H. Dunl
Yes, sir.
You're next, Jessie.
[Crowd cheering]
[Gavel pounding]
[Judge] order in the court!
[Gavel pounding]
Order in the court!
I want to warn the spectators that the court will not tolerate any undue disturbance at any time.
[Reporter] the 11th juror has been selected...
[Judge] Now, I thought I made myself plain.
I'm not going to warn you again about those photographs,
[Reporter] 11 down and 1 to go...
[Judge] and you reporters have just one more minute on those telephones.
[Reporters talking] as you know, for all last night and today, the legion of the unwashed and holy have been rivering out of the rustic back ways to listen to their plump messiah coo and bellow.
Their high priest of mumbo jumbo
Matthew Harrison Brady has alternately been stuffing himself with fried chicken and belching platitudes since his arriva l here 2 days ago.
[Gavel pounding]
[Judge] All right, can we continue, Col. Brady
Your honor, before we continue, will the court entertain a motion on a Matter of procedure
Will the learned prosecutor state the motion
It has been called to my attention that the temperature in this courtroom is now 97 degrees fahrenheit and it may get hotter!
[Crowd]
Ha ha! Amen! Amen!
I do not think the dignity of this court will suffer if we remove a few superfluous outer garments
Does the, uh, defense have any objection to Col. Brady's motion
Well, I don't know if the dignity of this court can be upheld with these galluses I've got on.
We'll, uh, take that chance, uh, Mr. Drummond.
Those who wish to remove their coats may do so.
[Chattering]
Is the, uh, counsel for the defense showing us the latest fashion from the great metropolitan city of Chicago
[Laughing]
Glad you asked me that.
I brought these along special. it just so happens
I bought these in peabody's general store in your hometown, Mr. Brady--
Weeping Water, Nebraska.
[Laughing]
[Gavel pounding]
Let us proceed with the selection of the final juror.
Mort.
State your name and occupation, Jess.
Jessie H. Dunlap, farmer.
Mr. Davenport.
You, uh, believe in the bible, Mr. dunlap
I believe in the holy word of God, and I believe in Matthew Harrison Brady.
[Crowd] Amen!
Hallelujah, brother.
[Gavel pounding]
This man is acceptable to the prosecution.
[Judge]
Mr. Drummond
No questions. Not acceptable.
Does Mr. Drummond refuse this man a place on the jury simply because he believes in the bible
If you find an evolutionist in this town, you can refuse him.
I object to the defense attorney rejecting a worthy citizen
Without so much as asking him a question
All right, I'll ask him a question.
How are you
Well... kind of hot.
Me, too.
Excused.
[Laughing]
[Gavel pounding]
You are excused from jury duty, Jessie.
You may step down.
Your honor,
I object to the note of levity which the counsel for the defense is introducing into these proceedings.
The court agrees with you in spirit, Col. Brady.
And I object to all this Col. Brady talk.
I am not familiar with Mr. Brady's military record.
Well, he was made honorary colonel in our state militia the day he arrived in Hillsboro.
Well, the use of the title prejudices the case of my client.
It calls up a picture of the prosecution a stride a white horse a blaze in the uniform of a military colonel and with all the forces of right and righteousness marshaled behind him.
Well, we certainly want to give you a fair hearing in this courtroom.
We don't want anything prejudicial to your client.
What do you suggest we do, counselor
Break him. Make him a private.
I have no serious objection to the honorary title of Private Brady.
[Crowd murmuring]
You better do something about this, Jason.
Get him up here.
Oh, Mr. drummond.
You know our mayor, Mr. Drummond.
Yes.
I believe he has a suggestion to make
By, uh, by authority of, uh... well, I'm sure the governor won't have any objection--
I hereby appoint you, Mr. Drummond, a temporary honorary colonel in the state militia.
Well...
Well, gentlemen, what can I say it certainly is not every day that a man attains the exalted position of temporary honorary colonel.
I thank you.
Col. Brady,
Col. Drummond,
You will examine the next venireman.
Mort.
George Sillers!
You're next,
George.
State your name and occupation, George
George Sillers. I work at the feed store.
Tell me, sir, would you call yourself a religious man
Well, I guess I'm as religious as the next fellow. in Hillsboro, sir, that means a great deal.
[Crowd agreeing]
Tell me, Mr. sillers,
Do you have any children
Uh, not as I know of.
[Laughing]
If you had a son, Mr. Sillers, or a daughter what would you think if that sweet child came home from school and told you that a godless teacher-
Objection! We're supposed to be selecting jury members.
The prosecution is denouncing the defendant before the trial has even begun.
Objection sustained.
Mr. Sillers, do you have any personal opinions with regard to the defendant that might prejudice you on his behalf
Cates
Hmm.
I don't hardly know the man.
Though he bought some peat moss from me one time.
H-he paid his bill.
Mr. Sillers impresses me as an honest, god-fearing man. 
I accept him.
Thank you,
Col. Brady.
Col. Drummond
Now, Mr. Sillers,
You, ah, you have just said that, ah, you were a religious man.
Do you work at it very hard
Well, I'm pretty busy down at the feed store
My wife tends the religion for both of us.
Oh, I see, I see.
You take care of this life, and she takes care of the next one, is that it that is objected to as immaterial and argumentative.
[Judge] objection sustained.
Now, tell me, Mr. Sillers,
While your wife has been taking care of the religion for the family have you ever heard of a fellow called Charles Darwin
Oh, not till recent.
Well, tell me something.
From what you've heard of this fellow Darwin, do you think he's the kind of a man you might invite up for Sunday dinner
Your honor, my worthy opponent from Chicago is cluttering up the issue with hypothetical questions.
I have already established that Mr. Sillers is not working very hard at religion.
Now, for your sake
I'm trying to establish that he is not working at evolution.
Oh, I'm just working at the feed store.
[Laughing]
[Gavel pounding]
Mr. Sillers, do you think you can render impartial--
Objection! The prosecution has already accepted this man.
But all I want is a fair trial.
So do I.
Unless the state of mind of the members of the jury conforms to the laws and patterns of society--
Oh, conform, conform. what do you want to do run the jury through a meat grinder to have them all come out the same
Take a box seat there, Mr. Sillers
Your honor! Your honor! this is ludicrous!
Gentlemen, you are both out of order.
The bench rules that the jury has been selected.
Due to the excessive heat court is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow morning.
[Chattering]
Ah, one moment, please. one moment
Order in the court
Rev. Brown has asked me to announce
"Pray for justice and guidance." All are invited.
Your honor, I object to that commercial announcement. commercial announcement of the Rev. brown's product.
Why don't you announce that there's going to be an evolution meeting
I have no knowledge of such a meeting.
That's quite understandable.
It isn't enough that everybody who comes into this courtroom has to pass under a sign which says read your bible.
I want that sign taken down, your honor.
[Crowd]
No! No!
Or else I want another sign put up just as big with just as big letters which says read your Darwin.
[Cheering and booing]
That's what I mean about this man.
[Judge] order!
Your honor, your honor, we want the learned counsel from the North to get every fairness and consideration in this trial.
We must not forget that he is our guest.
Guest, hell! I'm a lawyer in a courtroom.
Then behave like a lawyer.
Stop using this courtroom as a platform for your obscene ideas trying to dirty the minds of our young people here.
You are both out of order. Court is adjourned.
My conduct in this courtroom is not under question, and certainly not by you!
Well, your language is!
I don't swear just for the hell of it!
Language is a poor enough means of communication.
I think we should use all the words we've got.
Besides, there are damned few words that anybody understands!
Henry Drummond, atheist!
You! what are you going to say in your paper now
"He that sups with the devil must have a long spoon."
[Chattering]
[Man] Let's go.
Let's go folks, clear the floor.
We'll fix you, Cates. we'll run you out of town.
Well, anyway, the Baltimore Herald is with you... right up to the lynching.
Bert...
Bert, you've got to call the whole thing off now. who are you, young lady
This is Rachel Brown. We're engaged.
Brown Rev. Brown's daughter
Don't you see what's happening, Bert
They're using you as a weapon against your own people.
What you think or believe isn't the point anymore.
You're helping something bad.
No, young lady, it's not as simple as all that-- good or bad, black or white , day or night. do you know that at the top of the world the twilight is 6 months long
Bert and I don't live on top of the world.
We live in Hillsboro. and when the sun goes down, it's dark.
And why do you have to come here to make it different
I didn't come here to make Hillsboro different.
I came here to defend his right to be different.
And that's the point.
How about it, boy
I don't know what the point is anymore.
I tried to open their kids' minds...their kids.
I tried to give them knowledge they could use. they're using it-- as a stranglehold on me.
[Hornbeck]
You're learning, Cates.
Disillusionment is what little heroes are made of
Where do I finish dead with a paper medal on my chest
"Bert Cates, world's biggest chump-- he died fighting."
Let's face it-- to him, I'm a headline. To you, I'm a cause.
And to yourself
All right, let's face it.
Now, you chose to get into this by yourself.
You didn't get into it because of his headline or because of my cause, or maybe even because of their kids.
You got in to it because of yourself--
Because of something you believed in for yourself.
I didn't believe it would happen this way.
It can get worse.
Those people are in a lean and hungry mood.
They look at me as if I was a murderer.
[Chuckling] In a way, you are.
You know, you-- you kill one of their fairy-tale notions, and they'll bring down the wrath of god, Brady and the state legislature on you every time.
You make a joke out of everything.
Young lady
I know what Bert is going through.
It's the loneliest feeling in the world.
It's like walking down an empty street listening to your own footsteps.
But all you have to do is to knock on any door and say, "if you'll let me in,
"I'll live the way you want me to live, and I'll think the way "you want me to think," and all the blinds will go up, and all the doors will open, and you'll never be lonely, ever again.
Now, it's up to you, Cates.
You just say the word, and we'll change the plea-- th-that is, of course, if you honestly believe that the law is right and you're wrong.
Now, if that's the case, just tell me, and I'll pack my bag and go back to Chicago where it's a nice, cool 100 in the shade.
Bert, I've gone to my father's church every sunday as long as I can remember.
This is where I live.
This is where my children will be born.
What kind of a life could we have
Well, what kind of a life could we have if I gave up now your father's kind
Hallelujah, and ignorance, here we come
Rach, what goes on in this town is not necessarily the christian religion everyplace else.
Rach, I can't live the way you want me to
You're the one who's got to decide.
It's his church or our house.
You can't live in both.
[Mort] sorry, Bert.
I have to take you back now.
You ever been in love, Hornbeck
Only with the sound of my own words, thank God.
I have been to their cities and I have seen the altars upon which they sacrifice the futures of their children to the gods of science.
And what are their rewards confusion and self-destruction.
New ways to kill each other in wars
I tell you, gentlemen, the way of scientism is the way of darkness
Now, Mr. Brady, do you, ah, believe seriously that the majority of the American people hold with your views not just the views of Matthew Harrison
Brady, Mr. Hornbeck.
There isn't one state in the union where the evolutionists are in the majority.
It'll be the people themselves of our great land who will speak.
Mr. Brady, how do you account for the unfortunate comment that your crusade has aroused the attacks upon me stem from a vociferous minority which happens to control the press.
I hope you gentlemen-- madam-- will not be influenced by this same negative bias.
Pardon me.
Thank you, O lord, dear father, from whom all blessings flow, for thy bounty, make us worthy of thy grace, amen.
Go ahead, Henry. I said grace for you, too.
God may be a Matter of indifference to the evolutionists, and the life beyond hold no charms for them...
[Whispers] Sarah.
[Brady] But the mass of mankind will continue to worship.
Here, sit with me.
Thank you.
He'll be busy for a while.
Well, where is it, where is it
The hat with the little blue feather
Blue feather
You used to wear it to all the conventions. it was much too becoming.
[Chuckling]
Oh, Henry!
And whatever happened to that skinny black tie you used to wear
Not very attractive... like an old shoelace.
It's back in the shoe. how are you, Sarah how are you a little grayer, Henry. And you
A little grimmer.
I don't believe it. I watched you in court today.
You seemed to be enjoying it as much as ever.
That's Matt. He brings out the worst in me.
We've missed you, Henry.
You don't make many good friends in a lifetime.
I never dreamed our ideas would separate us.
[Brady] I have reason to be.
I have messages of encouragement from the governors of 22 states.
He still has a loud voice.
He still has something to say, Henry.
You mean about how everybody else should live
Oh, don't be cynical.
I think every man longs to be his brother's keeper and to be cared for in return.
It sounds more convincing coming from you.
He doesn't have a blue feather in his hat, that's all.
[Chuckling]
You know, looking back,
I don't think Matt would have made a great president,
But I would have voted for him for king.. just to have you for queen. and what would you have been
Your majesty's loyal opposition.
[Brady] "...of our belief in the written word of the bible.
I believe that Hillsboro..."
Pardon me,
"...will become the shrine of all" those millions upon millions
"who find a rallying point
"for their expression of God's will."
Now, that's all for today, gentlemen.
Hearken to the word!
Hearken to the word!
The word tells us that the world was created in 6 days.
In the beginning, the earth was without form, and void, and the lord said, "Let there be light."
[Crowd] Yeah! Yeah!
And there was light!
Amen!
And the lord saw the light, and the light saw the lord
And the light said, am I good, lord
And the lord said, thou art good.
[Cheering]
And the evening and the morning were the 1st day. and the lord said, "Let there be a firmament."
And even as he spoke, it was so.
And the evening and the morning were the 2nd day!
On the 3rd day,
Brought he forth the dry land, and the grass, and the fruit tree, and on the 4th day, the sun, the moon and the stars, and he pronounced them good.
The 5th day peopled he the sea with fish and the air with fowl, and made he the great whale, and he blessed them all!
[Crowd cheering]
But... on the morning of the 6th day, the lord rose, and his eye was dark, and the scowl lay across his face.
Why
Why was the lord troubled
Why tell us!
Tell us the troubles of the lord!
Tell us the troubles of the lord!
The lord looked around him, did the lord, at all his handiwork
Bowed down before him, and he said,
"It is not good! It is not enough!
It is not finished!"
"I shall make me... a man!"
[Crowd cheering]
Do we believe
[All]
Yes!
Do we believe the word
Yes!
Do we believe the truth of the word
Yes!
Do we curse the man who denies the word
Yes!
Do we call down hellfire on the man who has sinned against the word
Yes!
Whatever happened to silent prayer
O lord of the tempest and the thunder, strike down this sinner as thou did thine enemies of old in the days of the pharaohs.
Let him know the terror of thy sword!
Let his soul for all eternity writhe in anguish and damnation!
No!
No, Pa!
Don't pray to destroy Bert!
Lord, we ask the same curse for those who ask grace for this sinner though they be blood of my blood and flesh of my flesh!
Rev. Brown, Rev-
Rev. Brown, I know it's the great zeal of your faith which makes you utter this prayer, but it is possible to be overzealous, to destroy that which you hope to save so that nothing is left but emptiness. remember the wisdom of solomon in the book of proverbs--
"he that troubleth his own house" shall inherit the wind."
The bible also tells us that God forgives his children, and we as children of God should forgive each other
My good friends, return to your homes.
Go home.
The blessings of the lord be with you all.
We'll take you home, my dear.
I can't go home. He hates me.
He doesn't hate you.
He damned me. My own father damned me to hell.
No man has the power to damn.
He's always done it.
He did it to Bert and the little Stebbins boy.
Stebbins boy
That's how the whole thing started. the Stebbins boy was just an innocent child.
[Mr. Brady] God has no wrath for the innocent, my dear.
That's what Bert said.
He u--he used to say that when we-- when we were together.
I-if I could justexplain it clearly, then you'd understand.
Mr. Brady, please, I--
We'll do all we can to help you.
Come. Now, let's go home.
I'll be right up, Sarah.
All right, Matt.
Good night, Henry.
[Drummond] good night.
You're up late.
Too hot to sleep.
No use trying to fool ourselves, Henry
We're just not the men we used to be.
Ha ha!
By the size of that meal you packed away tonight,
I'd say you hadn't changed in 40 years.
[Laughing]
Funny how 2 people can start from the same point and... drift apart.
It's the nature of the life process.
There used to be a mutuality of understanding and... admiration between us, Henry.
Why is it, my old friend, that you've... you've moved so far away from me
Well, all motion is relative, Matt.
Maybe it's you who have moved away by standing still.
Hmm.
If progress means abandoning God abandoning the faith of our fathers--
I saw a demonstration of that faith tonight. it's a pretty deadly instrument, I'd say.
What you saw was a reflection of the violence and hate in the world around them,
Henry-- your world
But they're driven to it because their faith was challenged.
These are simple people, Henry, poor people. they work hard and they need to believe in something... something beautiful.
They're seeking for something more perfect than what they have
Window shopping for heaven. why do you want to take it away from them, Henry it's all they have... like a golden chalice of hope.
[Chuckling] Ah.
Like my golden dancer.
Your what?
Golden dancer.
She stood in the big side window in the general store in Wakeman, Ohio.
I'd stand out on the street and say to myself,
"if I had golden dancer, I'd have everything in the world I ever wanted."
I was about 7 years old at the time and a great judge of rocking horses.
Golden dancer had a bright-red mane, blue eyes, and she was gold all over with purple spots.
And when the sun hit her stirrups,
She was a dazzling sight to behold.
But she was a week's wages for my father,
So golden dancer and I always had a big plate-glass window between us.
And then...
Let's see...
It couldn't have been christmas.
It must have been my birthday.
I woke in the morning, and there was golden dancer at the foot of my bed.
Mom had skimped on the groceries, and my father had worked nights for a month.
I jumped into the saddle, and I started to rock... and it broke.
No
Split in 2. The wood was rotten.
The whole thing was put together with spit and sealing wax.
All shine and no substance,
And that's how I feel about that demonstration I saw tonight, Matt--
All glitter and glamour.
You say you're giving the people hope
I think you're stealing their hope.
Oh no, Henry --
[sighing]
As long as the prerequisite for that shining paradise is ignorance, bigotry, and hate...
I say, "the hell with it."
[Door closing]
We had to keep an open mind on the origin of species.
Very interesting, Howard.
Very interesting.
Now, go on, Howard tell us what else Mr. Cates told you in the classroom
Well, he said at first the earth was too hot for any kind of life. then it cooled off a mite, and cells and things began to grow. cells
Oh...oh!
Mr. McKinnon.
Mr. Galbraith.
I think you know the rest of these gentlemen.
[Gavel pounding]
Ahem.
Cells, Howard.
Little bugs, like in the water. then the little bugs got to be bigger bugs, and sprouted legs and crawled up on the land.
How long did this take according to Mr. Cates
Couple million years...maybe longer.
Then comes the fishes and the reptiles and the mammals.
Man's a mammal.
Along with the dogs... and the cattle in the field
Did he say that
Yes, sir.
Now, Howard,
How does man come out of this slimy mess of bugs and serpents, according to your, uh, professor
Well, man was sort of evoluted... from the old-world monkeys.
Did you hear that, my friends old-world monkeys!
Ha!
According to Mr. Cates, you and I aren't even descended from good American monkeys.
Now Howard, listen, carefully. in all this talk of bugs and evolution of slime and ooze, did Mr. Cates ever make any reference to God
[Sighing] not as I remember. of the miracle he achieved in 7 days as described in the beautiful book of genesis
No, sir.
Ladies and gentlemen--
Objection!
I ask the court to remind the learned counsel that he is not in a Chautauqua tent.
He's supposed to be submitting evidence to a jury.
There are no ladies on the jury.
Your honor...I have no intention of making a speech there is no need.
I am sure that everyone on the jury, everyone within the sound of this boy's voice is moved by his tragic confusion.
He has been taught that he wriggled up like an animal from the filth and muck below.
I say that these bible haters, these evolutionists, are brewers of poison! and the legislature of this sovereign state has had the wisdom to demand that the peddlers of poison, in bottles or in books, clearly label the product they attempt to sell.
I say that if this law is not upheld, this boy will become one of a generation shorn of its faith by the teachings of godless science!
But, if the full penalty of the law is meted out to Bertram Cates, the faithful the whole world over who are watching us here and listening to our every word will rise up and call this courtroom blessed!
Your witness, Sir.
I sure am glad the colonel didn't make a speech.
[Laughing]
Now, Howard...
I heard you say that the world used to get pretty hot.
Well, that's what Mr. Cates said.
Any hotter than it is right now, do you think
Well, I guess it must have been.
Mr. Cates read it to us from a book.
This the book
Charles Darwin's theory of the evolution and the descent of man
Yes, sir.
That's right, Howard.
That's the very book
He read to you in your classroom.
Now, Howard, tell me, do you think there was anything wrong in that
Well, I don't know
Objection, your honor.
The defense is asking that a 15-year-old boy hand down an opinion on a question of morality.
I am trying to establish that Howard, or Col.Brady, or Charles Darwin, or anyone sitting in this courtroom, or you, sir, has the right to think.
Col. Drummond, the right to think is not on trial here.
Well, with all due respect to the court, sir,
I think the right to think is very much on trial here... and it is fearfully in danger in the proceedings of this courtroom.
A man is on trial!
A thinking man! and he's faced with fine and imprisonment because he chooses to speak what he thinks.
Col. Drummond, will you please, ah, rephrase your question
Well now, let's put it this way, Howard-- all this fuss and feathers about evolution-- do you think it hurt you any
Sir
Did it do you any harm
Still feel reasonably fit what Mr. Cates told you,
Did it, ah, did it hurt your baseball game any did it affect your pitching arm
No, sir.
I'm a lefty.
A south paw, huh
Still honor your father and your mother
Sure.
Haven't murdered anybody since breakfast, have you
Objection.
This is an absurd piece of jactitation.
Ahem.
Counsel uses a word with which, ah, the bench is not familiar.
Jactitation--
A specious or false premise. in this instance, as to the murder of known or unknown persons.
Objection
Sustained.
Ahem.
Ask him if his faith in the holy scriptures has been shattered.
When I need your help, Col.Brady, you may rest assured I shall humbly ask for it.
Anytime, Col. Drummond, anytime.
He's the only man I know who can strut sitting down.
Now, Howard, tell me something-- did you believe everything Mr. Cates told you
I'm not sure.
I gotta think about it.
Good for you.
Good for you.
Now, uh, uh, your Pa's a farmer, isn't he
Yes, sir.
Got a tractor
Brand-new one.
You think there's anything sinful about a tractor because it isn't mentioned in the bible
No.
You know, Moses never made a phone call.
You figure that makes the telephone an instrument of the devil
I never thought of it that way.
Neither did anybody else!
Your honor, the defense makes the same old error of all godless men-- he confuses material things with the great spiritual value of the revealed word.
Why do you bewilder this child
Does right have no meaning to you, sir
Realizing that I may prejudice the case of my client,
I must tell you that right has no meaning for me whatsoever.
[Murmuring]
But truth has meaning...as a direction!
But... it is one of the peculiar imbecilities of our time that we place a grid of morality upon human behavior so that the action of every man must be measured against a... an arbitrary latitude of right and a longitude of wrong in exact minutes, degrees, and seconds, so...
Howard, do you know what the heck... do you understand what I'm talking about
No, sir.
Maybe someday you will.
That's all, son.
Thank you. you're excused.
This boy may not understand, but I do.
I've seen what you can do to a jury-- twist and tangle them.
Nobody's forgotten the Endicott publishing case, where you made the jury believe the obscenity was in their own minds
It was immoral, what you did to the jury. tricking them, judgment by confusion. you think you can get away with it here
I'm not trying to get away with anything!
I am simply trying to prevent the clock-stoppers from dumping a lot of medieval nonsense into the United States constitution. this is not a federal court, Col. Drummond.
Well, damn it, you have to start from somewhere!
Your honor, it's obvious what he's trying to do-- he is trying to make us forget the lawbreaker and put the law on trial
Well, we have the answer for you in our next witness.
Call miss Rachel Brown to the stand.
[Bailiff] Rachel Brown!
[Clerk] Rachel Brown, come to the stand, please!
Did you know about this
He didn't, but we should have.
Rach
Rach, what did you tell him
Take it easy, son.
Sit down, Samson.
You're about to get a haircut.
Rachel, do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God
I do.
Now, my dear,
I just want you to repeat some of the things you told me last night.
Please, Mr. Brady...
Rachel, didn't you say you wanted the people here to understand
Yes. 
Then just answer my question.
Now, Miss Brown, you are an old friend of the efendant, Bertram Cates
We're...we're engaged to be married.
Do you and Mr. Cates attend the same church
Yes...we did.
Do you now
What?
Attend the same church
No.
Did Mr. Cates leave the church
No, not really.
Not the spirit of it.
But the body of it, correct
Mr. Cates left the church you and he once attended together
Yes.
Why
Because of the Stebbins boy.
The Stebbins boy.
Would you tell us about that, please
It was 2 summers ago.
The little Stebbins boy was 13 years old.
He was one of Bert's students.
He lived right next door to the boarding house, and he used to come over
And look through
Bert's microscope.
Bert said the boy had a bright mind and--and he might even be a scientist when he grew up.
Yes
He--he went to the river with the other boys a-and went swimming.
He... he got a cramp... and drowned.
Go on.
At the funeral,
Pa preached that tommy didn't die in a state of grace because... because his father wouldn't allow him to be baptized.
Tell him what your father really said, that tommy's soul was damned, writhing in hellfire!
Cates, you sinner!
Religion's supposed to comfort people,
Not frighten them to death!
[Crowd murmuring]
[Gavel pounding]
We will have order, please.
Now, sit down, Bert.
Don't you see
Bert thought it wasn't fair that a little child couldn't go to heaven!
It wasn't God he abandoned, only the church!
Very well, my dear. It is true, then, that because of what happened to the Stebbins boy,
Bert Cates left the church!
We've said nothing wrong.
We are merely beginning to gain some insight into the experiences that sometimes will lead a young man astray.
Objection!
Whether my client went astray is a Matter of interpretation.
Strike it from the record.
Objection sustained.
The jury is directed to disregard the remarks of counsel.
Very well.
Now, my dear, will you tell the jury some more of Mr. Cates' opinions on the subject of religion
Objection!
Hearsay evidence is not admissible.
The court sees no objection to this line of questioning.
Proceed, Col. Brady.
Just repeat, in your own words, some of the conversations you had with the defendant.
Rachel, you can't.
The things I said to you were questions-- questions you ask your own heart.
If you say those things out loud, he'll make them sound like answers.
I--I can't.
You won't hurt him, Rachel. This is for his good.
Speak up.
Mr. Brady, I confided in you--
Well, we're here to serve the truth, Rachel, only the truth.
I can't remember.
Rachel, you are testifying under oath.
It is unlawful to withhold pertinent information.
Describe to the court your innermost feelings when Bert Cates said to you,
"God did not create man. Man created god."
Bert didn't say that!
He was just bitter because of the little Stebbins boy!
He said man created a vengeful god out of his own bigotry and the devil out of his own hell!
And when he wondered what's on the other side of the moon, did he ever mention the possibility of heaven did he or did he say there was nothing but a world of stars, moons, galaxies, and universal dust
Tell us, tell us some more.
What'd he say about the holy state of matrimony
Did he compare it to animal breeding
[Drummond] Objection!
You want the good people of this town to see what happened to his brain so they can help bring him back to his senses, don't ya
Tell it! Tell it all!
Tell it! Tell it! Tell it!
Matt!
[Sobbing]
Under the circumstances...
I believe the witness... should be excused.
Col. Drummond, do you have any objection to excusing the witness from cross- examination at this time, subject to later recall
Well, your honor, the defense must have a chance to challenge the words put into the mouth of the witness by the prosecutor.
Don't plague her. Let her go.
Uh, may I have a moment
Do you want every word he just put in her mouth to go in to the record
It's not that important.
Not th-- he just pulled you apart like a plucked chicken.
Please, do as I say. You've got to.
I've got to what send you to jail
Let her go.
You all-American idiot,
She just handed them your head on a silver platter.
Damn it, stay out of this!
It's none of your business.
Don't tie my hands, son.
Let her go, or I'll change my plea to guilty.
No questions.
For the time being, the witness is excused.
May I have your autograph
[Judge] Does the, uh, prosecution wish to call any further witnesses
Not, uh, not at the present time, your honor.
The prosecution rests.
We shall proceed with the case for the defense,
Col. Drummond.
I'd like to call Dr. Amos Keller... the head of the department of zoology at the University of Chicago.
Objection!
On what grounds
I wish to inquire what possible relevance the testimony of a zoology professor can have in this trial
Why, it has every relevance.
My client is on trial for teaching evolution.
Certainly any testimony relating to his so-called infringement of the law must be admitted.
Irrelevant, immaterial, inadmissible.
But why if Bertram Cates were on trial for murder, would it be irrelevant to call in witnesses to examine the weapon would it rule out testimony that the so-called murder weapon was incapable of firing a bullet
I fail to grasp, ah, the learned counsel's meaning.
Oh.
Uh, well, your honor,
The defense wishes to place Dr. Keller on the stand so that he can explain to the gentlemen of the jury ah, the exact meaning of the theory of evolution.
How can they pass judgment if they don't know what it's all about
I hold that the very law we're here to enforce excludes such testimony!
The people of this state have made it very clear that they do not want this zoological hogwash slopping around the schoolrooms, and I refuse to allow these agnostic scientists to employ this courtroom as a sounding board as a platform from which they can shout their heresies into the headlines
Col. Drummond, the bench rules that zoology is irrelevant to the case.
Agnostic scientists
Ahem.
I call Dr. Allen Page, deacon of the congregational church and professor of geology and archaeology at Oberlin College.
Objection.
Objection sustained.
Uh, does your honor deny in one breath
The existence of zoology, geology and archaeology we do not deny the existence of these sciences, but they do not relate to this point of law.
[Sighing]
I call Walter Aaronson, anthropologist, philosopher, author, and one of the most brilliant minds in the world today. Any objection
Objection!
Your honor, the defense has brought to Hillsboro, at great expense and great inconvenience, 6 noted scientists. their testimony is basic to the defense of my client... for I intend to show this court that what Bertram Cates spoke quietly one spring morning in the Hillsboro high school is no crime.
It is incontrovertible as geometry to any enlightened community of minds. in this community, Col. Drummond, and in this sovereign state, exactly the opposite is the case.
The language of the law is clear, your honor.
We do not need experts to question the validity of a law already on the books.
Well, what do you need a gallows to hang him from.
That remark is an insult to this entire community.
And this community is an insult to the world!
[Crowd murmuring]
Your honor, I request permission to withdraw from this case.
Mr. Drummond, you can't quit now!
Why not you were ready to 5 minutes ago!
Col. Drummond,
What reasons canyou possibly have
Well, there are 200 of them!
And if that's not enough, there's one more--
I think my client has already been found guilty.
Is Mr. Drummond saying that this expression of an honest emotion will in any way influence the court's impartial administration of the law
I say that you cannot administer a wicked law impartially.
You can only destroy.
You can only punish.
And I warn you that a wicked law, like cholera, destroys everyone it touches, its upholders as well as its defiers.
[Judge] Col. Drummond--
Can't you understand... that if you take a law like evolution and you make it a crime to teach it in the public schools, tomorrow you can make it a crime to teach it in the private schools and tomorrow you may make it a crime to read about it and soon you may ban books and newspapers. and then you may turn catholic against protestant and protestant against protestant and try to foist your own religion upon the mind of man!
If you can do one, you can do the other!
Because fanaticism and ignorance is forever busy and needs feeding. and soon, your honor... with banners flying and with drums beating, we'll be marching backward! 
Backward!
Through the glorious ages of that 16th century when bigots burned the man who dared bring enlightenment and intelligence to the human mind.
I hope counsel does not mean to imply that this court is bigoted.
Well, your honor has the right to hope.
I have the right to do more than that.
You have the power to do more than that!
And I exercise that power.
Col. Drummond, I order you to show cause tomorrow morning at 10:00
Why you should not be held in contempt of this court.
And in the meanwhile, I order that you be held in custody of the bailiff. bail is fixed at $2,000.
Why don't you make it $4,000
It's $4,000, Col. Drummond.
Your honor, my paper will post the bond.
Can you prove legal authorization to make such a commitment for your employer
Well, I'll wire my paper immediately.
Fine. Until then,
Col. Drummond can avail himself of our municipal accommodations.
[Crowd murmuring]
Your honor your honor, sir
I'll put up my farm for Mr. Drummond.
[Judge] We have no way of ascertaining the value of your farm, sir. it ought to be worth that much.
The law demands that bond be posted in cash.
Your honor, my bank will honor the offer on the security of this farm.
He has considerably more equity in it than that.
Ahem.
Very well. you can make arrangements with the court clerk.
Who are you my name is John Stebbins.
[Judge] Court will adjourn and reconvene at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow.
We'll hang Bert Cates to a sour apple tree
We'll hang Bert Cates to a sour apple tree
We'll hang Bert Cates to a sour apple tree
Our god is marching on glory, glory hallelujah glory, glory hallelujah...
She'll sleep all right tonight.
Give her these pills tomorrow and keep her in bed.
Thank you, John.

Rachel
We'll hang Bert Cates to a sour apple tree our god is marching on glory, glory hallelujah glory, glory hallelujah glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on
We'll hang Bert Cates to a sour apple tree
We'll hang Bert Cates to a sour apple tree
We'll hang Bert Cates to a sour apple tree our god is marching on
We'll hang Henry Drummond to a sour apple tree
We'll hang Henry Drummond to a sour apple tree
We'll hang Henry Drummond to a sour apple tree
Our god is...
[Knocking at door] glory, glory hallelujah glory, glory hallelujah glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on... trick or treat.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Hooligans of the world, unite!
You've got nothing to burn but your intellectuals.
Well, those are the boobs that make our laws.
It's a democratic process.
Well, I suppos e you have something better to suggest.
We'll hang Henry Drummond to a sour apple tree...
Looks like you're going out in a blaze of glory, counselor.
Well... you were pretty impressive for a while there today, Henry.
"your honor, after a while you'll be setting" man against man,
"creed against creed, et cetera, et cetera, ad nauseam."
Aw, Henry, why don't you wake up
Darwin was wrong. man's still an ape, and his creed's still a totem pole when he first achieved the upright position, he took a look at the stars-- thought they were something to eat.
When he couldn't reach them, he decided they were groceries belonging to a bigger creature. that's how Jehovah was born.
I wish I had your worm's-eye view of history.
It would certainly make things a lot easier.
Oh-oh, no! Not for you!
No, no, you--you'd still be spending your time trying to make sense out of what is laughingly referred to as the human race.
Why don't you take your blinders off
Don't you know the future's already obsolete
You think man still has a noble destiny.
Well, I tell you, he's already started on his backward march to the salt and stupid sea from which he came.
What about men like Bert Cates
Cates
The monkey who tried to fly
Cates climbed to the top of the totem pole but...then he jumped, and there was nobody there to catch him-- not even you.
You were there.
You saw what they did to my witnesses.
What you need is a drink.
What I need is a miracle.
A miracle
Here's a whole bagful-- courtesy Matthew Harrison Brady.
Your honor...
Your honor, I, uh...
I feel I owe you an apology.
Any remarks leading up to the contempt citation
I regret very much.
I realize your honor is trying to be fair and
I, uh... I'm very sorry for any remarks that were made in the heat of the moment.
My friends...
Col. Drummond... the man that I believe came into the world to save mankind from sin taught that it was godly to forgive.
I believe in those principles.
I accept Col. Drummond's apology.
I withdraw the contempt citation.
Thank you, your honor.
I, too, should like to add that in the spirit of forgiveness,
I feel no animosity toward learned counsel from Chicago.
He is well known to have ridden hobbyhorses before perhaps he'll return to his home having learned a lesson.
We commend him to learn in his heart the words of him who said,
"if you thirst, come unto me,
"and I will give you life."
That's why he hasn't an enemy in the world-- only his friends hate him.
Ahem.
Perhaps, ah, there is much to learn from the learned counsel for the prosecution.
Your honor, there were some remarks I made, ah, yesterday, ah, namely that I wish to withdraw from the case.
If it please the court,
I shall like to withdraw my withdrawal and continue as counsel for Bertram Cates.
[Judge] I see no reason why Col.Drummond should not continue as counsel for the defense.
Proceed, Col. Drummond.
Thank you,
Thank you.
Your honor, the court, ah, has ruled out any evidence as to scientific knowledge or the Darwinian theory. would the court admit evidence-- expert evidence-- on a book known as the holy bible
Ahem.
Any objection, Col. Brady
If counsel can advance the case for the defendant through the use of the holy scriptures, the prosecution will take no exception.
Good. I call to the stand one of the world's foremost experts on the bible and its teachings--
Matthew Harrison Brady.
[Crowd mumbling, judge banging gavel]
Your honor, this is preposterous!
Brother, let us pray.
Well, it's highly unorthodox
I've never known an instance where the defense called the prosecuting attorney as a witness.
Your honor, this entire trial is unorthodox... but if the interests of right and justice will be served,
I will take the stand.
But, Col.Brady... the court will support you if you wish to decline to testify as a witness against your own case.
Your honor,
I shall not testify against anything.
I shall speak out as I have all my life on behalf of the living truth of the holy scriptures.
Col. Brady-- no, no, no.
That won't be necessary to swear him in.
Oh, I can make affirmation.
I have no objection to swearing to God.
[Chuckling] No. I take it you will tell the truth.
Now, sir, I-I-I am right in calling upon you as an authority on-- on the bible, am I not
I believe it is not boastful to say that I have studied the bible as much as any layman, and I have tried to live according to its precepts.
Bully for you.
Now, I suppose you can quote me chapter and verse
Right straight through the King James version.
There are many portions of the holy bible that I have committed to memory.
I don't suppose there are many portions of this book you've committed to memory-- the origin of the species.
I am not the least interested in the pagan hypotheses of that book.
[Drummond] Never read it and I never will.
Then how in perdition have you got the gall to whoop up this holy war about something you don't know anything about
How can you be so cocksure that the body of scientific knowledge systematized in the writings of Charles Darwin is in any way irreconcilable with the book of genesis
Would you state that question again, please
Well now, let me put it this way.
On page 10 of the origin of the species,
Darwin states--
I object to this, your honor.
Col. Brady has been called as an authority on the bible. now the, ah... gentleman from Chicago is using this opportunity to read into the record scientific testimony which you, your honor, have previously ruled irrelevant.
If he's going to examine Col. Brady on the bible, let him stick to the bible, the holy bible and only the bible.
You will, uh, confine your questions to the bible.
All right.
Forget it.
We'll play in your ballpark, Colonel.
[Crowd chuckling]
Now a--a I'd like to get this part clear first.
Th-this is the book...this is the book th-that you're an authority on, isn't it
That is correct.
You believe that-- that every word written in this book should be taken literally everything in the bible should be accepted exactly as it is given there now, what about this part right here
Where, uh...
Uh, it talks about, uh,
Jonah being swallowed by the whale you figure that really happened
The bible do es not say "a whale."
It says "a big fish"
Heh heh heh.
[Chuckling] As a Matter of fact, it says a great fish."""
[Laughter]
But I guess one's pretty much the same as the other.
What do you...what do you think about that business
I believe in a god who can make a whale and who can make a man and make both do what he pleases.
God bless you, Matthew Harrison Brady.
[Crowd] Amen.
Hallelujah.
Hallelujah.
I want those Amen's in the record.
Now, I recollect a--a story about Joshua--
Joshua making the sun stand still.
Uh, as an expert, do you a...tell me that that's a... as right as the Jonah business
That's a pretty neat trick.
I do not question or scoff at the miracles of the lord as do ye of little faith
Have you ever pondered what would actually happen to the earth if the sun stood still
You can testify to that if I get you on the stand.
[Laughing]
If, as they say, "the sun stood still," they must have had some kind of an idea that the--that the sun moved around the earth.
Do you think that's the way of things or don't you believe the earth moves around the sun
I have faith in the bible. you don't have much faith in the solar system.
The sun stopped.
Good.
Now, if what you say actually happened-- if Joshua stopped the sun in the sky-- the earth stopped spinning on its axis, continents toppled over one another, mountains flew into space, and the earth shriveled to a cinder, crashed into the sun.
Now, how come they missed that little tidbit of news they missed it because it didn't happen.
But it had to happen,
It must have happened according to natural law, or don't you believe in natural law, Mr. Brady would you--would you ban copernicus from the classroom along with Charles Darwin would you pass a law throwing out all scientific knowledge since Joshua revelations, period
Natural law was born in the mind of the heavenly father. he can change it, cancel it, use it as he pleases
It constantly amazes me that you apostles of science, for all your supposed wisdom, fail to grasp this simple fact.
Now...ahem.
Now listen to this.
This is genesis, 4 to 16.
"and Cain went out from the presence of the lord, and dwelt in" the land of nod,
"on the east of eden. and Cain knew his wife."
Now, where the hell did she come from
Who
Mrs. Cain. Cain's wife.
If in the beginning there were just
Cain and Abel and Adam and Eve, where--where did this extra woman come from d-did you ever stop to think about that
No, sir.
I leave the agnostics to hunt for her.
Ha ha ha!
[Laughing]
[Gavel pounding]
Never bothered you
Never bothered me.
Never tried to find out
Nope.
You figure somebody else pulled another creation over in the next county somewhere the bible satisfies me. It is enough.
It frightens me to think of the state of learning in the world if everybody had your driving curiosity.
Now this book goes into a lot of "begats."
"and Arphaxad begat Salah... and salah begat Eber..." and so on and so on and so on.
How, are these pretty important people they are the generations of the holy men and women of the bible.
How'd they go about all this begatting
What do you mean
Well, I mean, did they a... did they begat in much the same way as folks get themselves begat today
The process is about the same
I don't think your scientists have improved it any.
Ha! Ha ha
[Laughing]
[Gavel pounding]
In other words, all of these folks were conceived and brought forth by the normal biological function known as sex.
What do you think of sex, Col.Brady in what spirit is this question asked
[Chuckling] I'm not asking you what you think of sex as a father, as a husband, or even as a presidential candidate. you're up here as an expert on the bible.
What is the biblical evaluation of sex
It is considered original sin. and all these holy people got themselves begat through original sin
Well... all that sinning make them any less holy
Your honor, where is this leading us
What has it got to do with the State v. Bertram Cates
Col. Drummond, the court must be satisfied that this line of questioning has some bearing on the case.
You've ruled out all of my witnesses. you must allow me to examine the one witness you've left to me in my own way.
Your honor
I am willing to sit here and endure Mr. Drummond's sneering and his disrespect for he is pleading the case of the prosecution by his contempt for all that is holy.
I object! I object! I object!
On what grounds
Is it possible that something is holy to the celebrated agnostic
Yes--
The individual human mind. in a child's power to master the multiplication table, there is more sanctity than in all your shouted "Amens" and "Holy holies" and "Hosannas"!
An idea is a greater monument than a cathedral, and the advance of man's knowledge is a greater miracle than all the sticks turned to snakes or the parting of the waters.
But now, are we to forgo all this progress because Mr. Brady now frightens us with a fable
Gentlemen,
Progress has never been a bargain. you have to pay for it. sometimes I think there's a man who sits behind a counter and says, "all right, you can have a telephone,
"but you lose privacy and the charm of distance."
Madam, you may vote, but at a price.
"you lose the right to retreat behind the powder puff" or your petticoat
"Mister, you may conquer the air," will lose their wonder... but the birds
"and the clouds will smell of gasoline."
Darwin took us forward to a hilltop from where we could look back and see the way from which we came.
But for this insight and for this knowledge, we must abandon our faith in the pleasant poetry of Genesis.
We must not abandon faith!
Faith is the most important thing!
Then why did God plague us with the power to think
Mr. Brady, why do you deny the one faculty of man that raises him above the other creatures of the earth-- the power of his brain to reason what other merit have we the elephant is larger, the horse is swifter and stronger, the butterfly is far more beautiful, the mosquito is more prolific, even the simple sponge is more durable.
Or does a sponge think
I don't know.
I'm a man, not a sponge.
[Laughing]
Well, do you think a sponge thinks
If the lord wishes a sponge to think, it thinks.
Do you think a man should have the same privilege as a sponge
Of course.
This man wishes to be accorded the same privilege as a sponge.
He wishes to think!
But your client is wrong!
He is deluded! he has lost his way!
It's sad that we don't all have your positive knowledge of what is right and wrong,
Mr. Brady.
How old do you think this rock is
I am more interested in the rock of ages than I am in the age of rocks.
Ha! 
Ha ha
Dr. Page of Oberlin College tells me this rock is at least 10 million years old.
Well, well ...
Col. Drummond, you managed to sneak in some of that scientific testimony after all.
Look, Mr. Brady... these are the fossil remains of a marine prehistoric creature found in this very county and which lived here millions of years ago when these very mountain ranges were submerged in water.
I know.
The bible gives a fine account of the flood.
But your professor's a little mixed-up on his dates.
That rock is not more than 6,000 years old.
How do you know
A fine biblical scholar, Bishop Usher, has determined for us the exact date and hour of the creation it occurred in the year 4004 B.C.
Ah, well, uh, that...
That's...that's, uh, Bishop Usher's opinion.
It's not an opinion.
It's a literal fact, which the good Bishop arrived at through careful computation of the ages of the prophets as set down in the old testament.
In fact, he determined that the Lord began the creation on the 23rd of october, 4004 B.C. at, uh, 9 a.m.
At eastern standard time or rocky mountain time it wasn't daylight saving time, was it because the lord didn't make the sun until the 4th day.
That is correct.
That first day, uh...
Wha-what do you think it was,
24 hours long
Bible says it was a day.
Well, there was no sun h-how do you know how long it was
The bible says it was a day.
Well, was it a normal day, a literal day, a 24-hour day
I don't know.
[Col. Drummond] what do you think
I do not think about things that I do not think about.
Do you ever think about things that you do think about
Isn't it possible that it could have been 25 hours there was no way to measure it.
No way to tell.
Could it have been 25 hours
It is possible. then you interpret that the first day as recorded in the book of Genesis could have been a day of indeterminate length
I mean to state that it is not necessarily a 24-hour day.
It could have been 30 hours,
It could have been a week.
It could have been a month, it could have been a year, it could have been a hundred years, or it could have been 10 million years!
I protest!
This is not only irrelevant, immaterial, it is illegal!
I demand to know the purpose of Mr. Drummond's examination.
What's he trying to do
I'll tell you what he's trying to do. 
He wants to destroy everybody's belief in the bible and in God.
That's not true, and you know it.
The bible is a book.
It's a good book, but it is not the only book.
It is the revealed word of the almighty God spake to the men who wrote the bible.
How do you know that god didn't spake to Charles Darwin
I know, because God tells me to oppose the evil teachings of that man.
Oh, God speaks to you
Yes!
He tells you what is right and wrong,
Yes and you act accordingly
Yes.
So you, Matthew Harrison Brady, through oratory or legislature or whatever, you pass on god's orders to the rest of the world!
Well, meet the prophet from Nebraska!
Is that the way of things is that the way of things
God tells Brady what is good. to be against Brady is to be against God.
No! each man is a free agent!
Then what is Bertram Cates doing in a Hillsboro jail supposing Mr. Cates had the influence and the lung power to railroad through the state legislature a law saying that only Darwin could be taught in the schools
Ridiculous! Ridiculous!
There is only one great truth in the world.
The gospel-- the gospel according to Brady.
God speaks to Brady, and Brady tells the world!
Brady, Brady, Brady almighty!
The lord--the lord is my strength! suppose that a lesser human being-- suppose a Cates or a Darwin had the audacity to think that God might whisper to him, that an un-Brady thought might still be holy must a man go to prison because he differs with the self-appointed prophet extend the testaments.
Let us have a book of Brady.
We shall hex the Pentateuch and slip you in neatly between Numbers and Deuteronomy!
N-now, my friends...
Your honor, my followers.. ladies and gentlemen...
The witness is excused!
All of you know what I stand for.
What I believe...
I believe in the truth of the book of Genesis--
Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,
Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1st Samuel,
2nd Samuel, 1st Kings, 2nd Kings,
Isaiah, Jeremiah,
Lamentations,
Ezekiel...
[Judge] Court is adjourned until 10:00 tomorrow morning.
[Judge pounding gavel]
[Chattering]
Matt
Matt, dear let's go home.
Home
Back to the hotel.
Uh.
[Knocking at door]
Who is it
Where is he
I've got to talk to him.
Not now, Rachel. He isn't feeling well.
Yes, now.
He's got to tell Bert it wasn't my fault
Rachel, please be quiet. He's sleeping.
Why should I be quiet
I want the whole world to know that Matthew Harrison Brady's a fake.
Rachel!
I'm sorry.
I found myself in bed today, in the middle of the day.
I-I was dreaming I was in the witness chair-- chained to it.
I kept begging him to let me go.
Oh, Rachel, Rachel, it's been a nightmare for all of us.
But mine was real.
I turned to your husband for help. he encouraged me to open up my heart to him, and then he twisted my words.
He tricked me.
Why why did he do it
I don't know.
I don't know why he did it.
Maybe it meant too much to him.
Maybe he was tired or afraid.
I taught my pupils that Matthew Harrison Brady was a great man-- next to God, almost.
What do you want me to teach them now
He's still the same man.
No, if he could do such an evil thing, then he must be an evil man, and everything he stands for must be evil, too.
Oh, stop it! stop it!
Youth can be so pure.
What do you know of good or evil what do you understand of the sum of a man's life
He betrayed me.
You betrayed yourself.
You see my husband as a saint, and so he must be right in everything he says and does. and then you see him as a devil, and everything he says and does must be wrong.
Well, my husband's neither a saint nor a devil.
He's just a human being... and he makes mistakes.
How can you defend him it's not he I'm defending.
I'm defending the 40 years I've lived with this man and watched him carry the burdens of people like you.
If he's been wrong, at least he stood for something.
What do you stand for do you believe in Bertram Cates
I believe in my husband.
What do you believe in
Matt.
I was asleep, but...
What can I do for you, child
I'm not your child any longer,
Mr. Brady-- yours... or anyone else's.
[Door closing]
What...
What did she want, Sarah
Whe's been hurt, Matt.
You hurt her.
Oh, Matt, you were always a good man. that's why I loved you, even from the very beginning. people said you made mistakes, wrong decisions. you could have been president 3 times over, but I never doubted you, Matt, because your decisions were honest.
You never sacrificed your principles just to win.
I didn't mean to hurt her.
Sarah...
Sarah, a victory here would be a monument to God that would last a 1,000 years! but Matt, every man has to build his own monument.
You can't do it for them, Matt.
If you do, it becomes your monument, not theirs, and they'll topple it the minute they find a flaw in it. you mean a flaw in me, don't you, Sarah they turned away from you this afternoon, Matt.
Ah, they didn't understand.
I'll make them understand.
They'll have to understand.
My speech. Where's my speech
Matt...
I'll make them listen.
Matt!
Where's my speech I must have it!
I'll make them understand!
Matt, please don't get excited.
Here--here it is. I have it all down on paper here.
Sarah.
It isn't just this case.
It's god himself that's on trial.
They'll--they'll have to listen to me.
They will listen to me.
They'll listen, dear.
Mother, they laughed at me.
Hush, baby.
I can't stand it when they laugh at me.
It's all right, baby.
It's all right.
They laughed.
Baby...
Baby...
Ahem.
Testing, testing, testing.
Testing, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[Chattering]
You brought me some more clean shirts
Bert, I left my father.
I messed things up pretty badly for us, didn't I
It wasn't your fault, Rach.
I know how Brady can twist things--
It wasn't his fault.
I should have done this from the beginning.
I-I want--
Rach...
You don't have to say it.
I'm just glad you're here.
Come on, you sit down.
Well, welcome back to our side, Miss Brown.
What's that
Enunciator doing a broadcast got a direct wire to WGN, chicago. as soon as the jury returns, we'll broadcast the verdict.
Mmm, radio.
God, that's going to break down a lot of walls.
You're not supposed to say "God" on the radio.
Why the hell not
You're not supposed to say "hell," either
This is going to be a barren source of amusement.
Well, Colonel...
There's a little toy you'll never have any use for, not with your lungs.
Uh, the radio.
You whisper into it, and it shouts at a million people through loudspeakers.
What do you think
Can you tell from their faces
Everybody rise.
Hear ye, hear ye. court will reconvene in the case of the State v. Bertram Cates.
All right. Go ahead
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Harry Esterbrook speaking to you from the courthouse here in Hillsboro, where the jury has returned to render its verdict in the historic Hillsboro monkey trial case.
The judge has taken the bench, in a few moments, we will know whether Bertram Cates will be found innocent or guilty.
I wish I could describe the tension, in this courtroom today,
The verbal and legal elements-- one moment, please.
Please stand by.
I've been on the phone with the lieutenant governor all morning.
The newspapers haven't been very kind to us.
The boys in the capital seem to think it wouldn't do any harm if you was to let this whole thing kind of...simmer down.
Well now, wait a minute, Jason, I have an obligation to the law.
Of course you have, Merle, but...but don't forget, November's not too far off.
[Clears throat]
Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict
Yes, sir-- er, your honor-- w-we have.
The, uh, verdi ct of the jury is unanimous--
Bertram Cates is found guilty as charged.
And so, ladies and gentleman, you have heard the verdict as read by presiding Judge Coffey.
Bertram Cates, schoolteacher, keystone, and defendant in one of the greatest ethical contests known to our country,
Bertram Cates has been found guilty.
The law has been satisfied.
But what profound repercussions of what has happened in this courtroom will be known only to the future.
Quiet, please.
Order.
Stand by, please.
This court is still in session
You'll remove that now, please.
The prisoner will rise to hear the sentence of this court.
Bert, do you wish to make any statement before sentence is passed
Your honor, I'm not a public speaker.
I do not have the eloquence as some of the... men you've heard in the last few days.
I'm just a schoolteacher.
Not anymore,
You ain't!
[Crowd murmuring agreement]
[Gavel pounding]
I was a schoolteacher.
I feel that...
I've been convicted of violating an unjust law.
I will continue in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can.
[Judge] Bertram Cates, this court has found you guilty of violating public act volume 37, statute 31428 as charged. this violation is punishable by fine and, or imprisonment.
But since there has been no previous violation of this statute, there's no precedent to guide the bench passing sentence. court deems it proper to sentence Bertram Cates to pay a fine of...
Ahem.
[Excited chattering]
Ah...ah, did ah...
Did your honor say $100
That is correct.
That seems to conclude the business of the trial.
But, your honor, the prosecution takes exception.
Why, the issues are so titanic the court must mete out more drastic punishment--
I object. to make an example of this transgressor, to show the world--
Just a minute, just a minute.
The amount of the fine is of no concern to me, because Bertram Cates has no intention of paying this or any other fine.
If it were one single dollar, he would not pay it.
We are going to appeal this decision to the state supreme court.
Will the court grant us 30 days in which to prepare the appeal
Granted.
Court fixes bond at $200.
I believe that concludes the business of this trial
Therefore, I declare this court adjourned.
Your honor, with the court's permission,
I should like to read into the record a few short remarks which I have prepared.
I object to that.
Mr. Brady is free to read any remarks, long, short, or otherwise, in a Chautauqua tent or a political campaign, but our business in Hillsboro is completed.
The defense moves that the court be adjourned.
But I-I have a few remarks--
[Judge] and we are all anxious to hear them, sir
But Col.Drummond's point of procedure is well taken.
I'm sure everyone here will wish to remain after the court is adjourned
To hear your address.
I hereby declare this court is adjourned,
Sine die.
[Judge pounding gavel]
[Shouts] My friends, my dear friends
Your attention, please.
[Clamoring]
Fellow citizens and friends of the unseen audience, from the hallowed hills of sacred sinai in the days of remote antiquity came the law...
[Clamoring]
[Child bangs gavel] and here, here in this courtroom... here in this courtroom...
Oh, no, no.
As they would look to the mountains.. from time remembered, wherever man's body has known the last of hunger..
[Brady] lost in darkness and despair, and here-- here in this courtroom, living still, in spite of dunge on, fire and sword
[Man] Eskimo pies, 5 cents.
Eskimo pies!
Eskimo pies, sweet as honey.
Here's where you bring your money.
Eskimo pies.
...is a law.
[Brady continues]
[Brady] from the hallowed hills of sacred sinai in the days of remote antiquity came the law, which has been our bulwark and our shield and here, here in this courtroom, we have seen vindicated the faith of our fathers. living still in spite of dungeon, fire and sword.
Oh, how our hearts be high with joy, whenever we hear the glorious word
Faith of our fathers, holy faith, we will be true to thee...
[Loses voice] till death...
[Loses voice]
[Breathing heavily]
Matt!
Matt!
[Mmrs. Brady] Oh, dear god. Matt!
[Man] Get back. Let him have some air.
[Woman] Lord, pass us a miracle and save our holy prophet!
[Man] Get a doctor.
[Drummond] I cannot imagine the world without Matthew Harrison Brady.
Ah, get me the Baltimore Herald, please.
What did he die of did they say
He died of a busted belly.
There was much greatness in the man. can I quote you in the obituary
Write anything you damn-- write anything you please.
How do you write an obituary for a man who's been dead 30 years
Operator
Say, what did he say to the minister
You know, that fits.
He delivered his own obituary.
Ah, ah, where'd you put that, uh--
Ah, here it is.
His book.
That, ah, was proverbs, wasn't it
"He that troubleth his own house" shall inherit the wind.
"and the fool shall be servant to the wise in heart."
Well...
Well, Col.Drummond, we're growing an odd crop of agnostics this year.
[Drops bible]
You know, Hornbeck
I'm getting damned sick of you.
Why
You never pushed a noun against a verb except to blow up something. 
You know, that's a typical lawyer's trick... accusing the accuser.
Of what am I accused
Contempt of conscience. sentimentality in the first degree.
Why, because I refuse to erase a man's lifetime
No, because you know what I thought of him, and I know what you thought, so let's leave the lamentations to the illiterate.
What is this, be-kind-to-bigots week
Why should we weep for him
Because he's dead.
Oh, no.
Besides, he cried enough for himself during his lifetime.
The national tearduct from Weeping Water, Nebraska.
[Laughing] he flooded the nation like a one-man Mississippi.
You know what he was, that bible-beating bunco artist. a giant once lived in that body, but Matt Brady got lost because he looked for a god too high up and too far away.
Wh-why, you hypocrite.
Y-you fraud.
The atheist who believes in God.
Aah, you're just as religious as he was.
Everything is grist for your mill, isn't it
Well, go ahead, grind it up--
Brady's past, Cates' future.
My god, don't you understand the meaning of what happened here today
What happened here today has no meaning.
You have no meaning.
You're like a ghost pointing an empty sleeve and smirking at everything that people feel or want or struggle for.
I pity you.
You pity me
Isn't there anything... what touches you what warms you
Every man has a dream. what do you dream about what--what do you need you don't need anything, do you people-- love-- an idea, just to cling to you poor slob. you're all alone.
When you go to your grave, there won't be anybody to pull the grass up over your head, nobody to mourn you, nobody to give a damn.
You're all alone.
You're wrong, Henry.
You'll be there.
You're the type.
Who else would defend my right to be lonely
[Sighing]
...of the coming of the lord
He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on
Glory! Glory!
Hallelujah
Glory! Glory!
Hallelujah
Glory! Glory!
Hallelujah
The Secretary of State for War has today received the following dispatch from Lord Chelmsford,
Commander in Chief of Her Majesty's forces in Natal colony, South Africa.
"I regret to report a very disastrous engagement
"which took place on the morning of the 22nd January
"between the armies of the Zulu king Cetshwayo
"and our own Number 3 Column, consisting of Five Companies
"of the 1 st Battalion,
24th Regiment of Foot,
"and one company of the 2nd Battalion,
"a total of nearly 1,500 men, officers and other ranks.
"The Zulus, in overwhelming numbers, launched a highly disciplined attack
"on the slopes of the mountain of Isandhlwana,
"and in spite of gallant resistance..."
What did he ask, Father?
Whether a man of God like myself was pleased to see so many warriors married to so many maidens at one time.
How can he imagine it would please anyone?
Do you think I said it pleased me, daughter?
I told him I was unhappy to see so many brides who may soon become widows.
That was a very good answer, Father.
Why do they have those little spears?
The girls, I mean?
It's a symbol of their chastity, daughter.
It's splendid, I know, but it's quite horrible too, isn't it?
The Book says, "What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
- "A man clothed in soft raiment?"
- Yes, Father.
You must understand these things if you're going to stay in Africa,
Margareta.
That's why I brought you here.
They are a great people, daughter.
But how can they let themselves be married in droves like this?
Young girls to old men.
In Europe, young women accept arranged marriages with rich men.
Perhaps the Zulu girls are luckier getting a brave man.
Margareta.
Wait.
- All right.
- Father!
Wait. Wait, Margareta.
- Dear Lord in Heaven!
- What is it? Father?
One thousand British soldiers have been massacred.
While I stood here talking peace, a war has started.
Ishiwan! Ishiwan!
Ishiwan? Didn't you say that Ishiwan...
Yes. It's their name for our mission station at Rorke's Drift.
- They're going to destroy it.
- Why?
Because there are British soldiers at Rorke's Drift.
- But it's only a handful.
- Come.
- It is a hospital. Father, tell him.
- Do you think he will listen?
We must get there.
There'll be a massacre.
Father! Father!
- All right, Corporal Allen.
- Sir. Corp? Let go.
Right turn.
Quick march.
Colour Sergeant Bourne, what's that shooting?
A rifle, Hughes.
If you're sick in hospital,
I suggest you go and lie down.
Yes, Colour Sergeant.
Hey, Hookie, who's doing all that shooting?
- Who do you think?
- Who do you think?
Mr Flaming Bromhead is shooting flaming defenceless animals for the flaming officers' flaming dinner.
I wish he'd bring us some fresh meat.
I wonder what they're cooking for supper.
Same as usual.
Horse meat and axle grease.
Which one has got the bullet?
She was as beautiful as a butterfly.
She was as beautiful as a buttertly and as proud as a queen
Was pretty little Polly Perkins of Paddington Green
Shut up, you cripple!
She was as beautiful as a buttertly and as...
Come on, make your mind up.
It's turning blue.
Yeah, yeah, very pretty, lovely.
Which one?
It's under that one.
The boy's clever. The boy's good.
How about putting some money on?
Five rounds!
Independent! Fire!
Stuff me with green apples.
You know, if a dog was as sick as him, they'd shoot him.
Five rounds! Independent!
Fire!
Shut up, you rotten, sick...
Why don't you leave him alone?
He's sick enough. You'll kill him!
Wouldn't bother Hookie, would it, Hookie?
Wouldn't bother, Hookie, it wouldn't matter if Maxfield was dead.
I don't care if you were all dead. Blimey!
Rorke's Drift.
It'd take an Irishman to give his name to a rotten, stinking middle-of-nowhere hole like this.
Hold that pont!
- Corporal Allen?
- Sir?
- Get some men in the water!
- Sir.
Hey!
You heard that Officer of Engineers.
Get it.
Heave! Put a bit more weight on that rope, you men.
- He's even got a voice like a corporal.
- Yeah.
Sort of like a female hippopotamus in labour.
- Hot work?
- Damned hot work.
Still, the river cools you off a bit, though?
- Who are you?
- John Chard. Royal Engineers.
Bromhead. 24th.
That's my post, up there.
You've come down from the column?
That's right.
They want a bridge across the river.
Who said you could use my men?
They were sitting around on their backsides doing nothing.
Rather you asked first, old boy.
I was told their officer was out hunting.
Yes.
I'll tell my man to clean your kit.
- Don't bother.
- No bother.
I'm not offering to clean it myself.
Still, a chap ought to look smart in front of the men.
Don't you think?
Well, chin-chin.
Do carry on with your mud pies.
You.
- What's your name?
- Owen.
Sir.
- Are you supposed to be here?
- Yes, sir.
Well, not exactly. You see, sir, only, you've got my solo tenor out there.
- I've got your what?
- 612 Williams, sir.
We were going to practise this afternoon with the company choir.
But you've got my only solo tenor working out there in the cold water.
Well, I hope he sings better than he works.
Oh, indeed, sir. He does.
Every piece of wood in this blistering country's eaten by ants.
The heat and the dust, sir.
Very nasty on the larynx.
Mr Bromhead lets you have a choir, does he?
Well, every Welsh regiment has a choir, sir.
Mr Bromhead is English, but he is a proper gentleman.
There's no doubt of that.
- And what do you sing?
- Me, sir? Baritone, sir.
Good.
I can find work for baritones as well as tenors.
See what you make of that, over there, below the escarpment.
- Two riders.
- Gallopers from the column, sir?
Very wonderful things, these, sir, aren't they?
- Corporal Allen?
- Sir?
- Get your party ashore at the double.
- Sir.
All right, you heard that Officer of Engineers.
Make fast and back to the bank. Move.
Come on, lad. Hop on it.
- Trouble, sir?
- Could be.
I can anchor the ponts midstream, sir.
With six riflemen I could...
This is a situation you think an Engineer
Officer can't handle, Corporal?
- No, sir. Beg your pardon, sir.
- Fall them in.
We ain't finished the bridge, sir.
- Fall them in, Corporal.
- Sir.
Get fell in, you men. Squad.
Squad, 'shun.
Left turn.
Left wheel. By the left. Quick march.
Left, left.
Left, left, left, right, left. Left, left.
Hey! Hey, you!
What's going on down there?
They're building barricades or something.
What's that?
Ride like hell.
Tell them they can't get here too soon.
- Corporal.
- Sir.
I want all these people out of here.
Douse these cooking fires and turn the boilers over.
- But they've got soup in them, sir.
- Pour it on the fires.
- And get yourself a rifle.
- A rifle, sir? But I don't...
Mr Chard? Mr Chard?
- Commissary Dalton, is it?
- That is correct.
But Mr Chard, you've just asked this man...
To pour the soup on the fires.
See that he does it.
All these bags of maize inside the perimeter.
And I don't want these tents providing cover for the enemy.
Does he know what it's like to make soup for 100 men in this flaming heat, Mr Dalton, does he, sir?
Oh, now, don't distress yourself, my dear fellow.
There's your own officer over there.
- You go and speak with him.
- Yes, sir.
Chard?
This is Adendorff, Natal Native
Contingent from Isandhlwana.
Bromhead, 24th Foot.
You've come from there?
All right, man, is it true?
Beg your pardon, sir.
About the soup, sir.
- What about the soup?
- Well, this gentleman, sir, said to put it on the fire.
He did?
We have thatched roofs here,
Bromhead.
No need to make the Zulus a present of fire.
Yes.
Then get on with it.
- There's a good fellow.
- Well, am I to take a rifle, too, sir?
The entire column.
- It's damned impossible. 800 men?
- 1,200 men.
There were 400 native levies also.
Damn the levies, man.
More cowardly blacks.
What the hell do you mean, cowardly blacks?
They died on your side, didn't they?
And who the hell do you think is coming to wipe out your little command, the Grenadier Guards?
What the deuce is the matter with him?
- Adendorff? Are you staying?
- Is there anywhere else to go?
Talk to our levies, will you?
Tell them whose side they're on.
Did the runner bring orders?
He brought orders to the commander of this post.
- To do what?
- To hold our ground.
To hold our ground?
What military genius thought up that one?
Somebody's son and heir who got a commission before he learnt to shave?
I rather fancy that he's nobody's son and heir now.
- Who are they?
- The Witts.
- Witts?
- The Swedish missionaries here.
This is their station.
They've chosen a damned odd time for a prayer meeting.
I think you better get them out of here.
Are you giving me an order, old boy?
Bromhead?
Let's get one thing clear.
I'm no line officer. I'm an engineer.
- I came here to build a bridge.
- Jolly lucky for you.
I mean, otherwise, you would've been chopped with the rest of the column, wouldn't you?
All right.
What's the date of your commission?
Now don't tell me.
I suppose you have seniority.
1872. May.
1872. February.
Oh, well. I suppose there are such things as gifted amateurs. If I may...
Are you questioning my right to command?
Oh, not your right, old boy. Never mind.
We can cooperate, as they say.
- I'll be here, won't I?
- Bromhead?
Have you been here long enough to put a lookout on that hill?
Not since we've been chatting, no.
I've started the barricades, though.
I managed to think of that.
Who's the sergeant with the muscles?
Sgt Windridge. Good man.
Not you again?
Yes, sir, Surgeon Reynolds.
It's me arm, sir.
The only trouble with your arm is you never do any work with it.
Pretty terrible pain, sir.
All right. Off with your vest.
- Now, sir?
- Now, sir.
Yes, sir.
It's cruel to bend, sir.
You know what you've got there, my malingering Hector?
No, sir. Hook's the name, sir.
You've got a fine, handsome boil, my friend.
There's one glistening boil for every soldier in Africa.
You may not win many medals on this campaign, Hook, but you'll certainly get more boils.
For every gunshot wound I probe,
I expect to lance three boils.
Spot of medicinal brandy would set me up, sir.
Brandy's for heroes, Mr Hook.
The rest of you will make do with boils in your skin, flies in your meat and dysentery in your bellies.
Now, then, this is going to hurt you a lot more than it will me,
I'm happy to say.
Mr Bromhead? Cetshwayo is coming with two impis to destroy you.
You must talk to Lt Chard, Mr Witt.
He commands here. Margareta.
Mr Chard, I am ready to take away your sick and wounded.
Please supply the wagons. Daughter, tell the men in the hospital to get ready.
One moment, Miss Margareta. Mr Witt?
I don't suppose you hold the Queen's Commission?
I am a man of peace, sir.
Then allow a Queen's officer to give orders to her soldiers.
Now, how do you know what Cetshwayo is doing?
We have just come from his kraal, sir.
He's a member of my parish.
Your parish? Are you sure you're on the right side of the river, Mr Witt?
I am here to do my duty.
I expect your cooperation.
What's our strength?
Seven officers, including surgeon, commissaries and so on.
Oh, and Adendorff now, I suppose.
Wounded and sick, 36.
Fit for duty, 97.
And about 40 native levies.
Not much of an army for you.
There are 4,000 Zulus coming against you.
You must abandon this mission.
Mr Chard?
Adendorff sent his trooper to Helpmekaar.
There's a relief column there, isn't there? A cavalry?
There was three days ago.
Mr Bromhead, issue all our walking wounded with arms and ammunition.
You will all be killed like those this morning.
And now the sick in their beds.
All of you.
I don't think so, Mr Witt.
The army doesn't like more than one disaster in a day.
It looks bad in the newspapers and upsets civilians at their breakfast.
Sir, the Book says,
"There is no king that can be saved by the multitude of a host,
"neither is any man..."
Mr Witt?
When I have the impertinence to climb into your pulpit and deliver a sermon, then you may tell me my duty.
It is not your duty to sacrifice the sick.
Are you a student of tactics too,
Miss Witt?
Are you a Christian?
Sgt Windridge?
It is your duty to let us take those men away.
Not that way, Miss Witt.
- Sir.
- Come, daughter.
Sergeant, put two good men on that hill and tell them to keep their eyes peeled.
- Mr Bromhead, sir?
- Double up, damn it!
Carry on, Sgt Windridge, there's a good fellow.
Sir.
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Sir.
Mr Bromhead?
You know, I had a calf like you once, back home in Merioneth.
I'll get you some milk.
I'll make you strong.
Would you like that, then?
What the hell do you think you're doing at a time like this? Shut up!
Owen!
Yes, Sergeant?
- You've got a voice, haven't you?
- Yes, baritone, Sergeant.
Well, get up on that hill and sing out if you see anything.
You, too.
And take your bandook, you dozy Welshman!
The classical attack of the Zulus is in the shape of a bull buffelo like this.
The head, the horns and the loins.
First, the head moves forward and the enemy naturally moves in to meet it, but it's only a feint.
The warriors in the head then disperse to form the encircling horns and the enemy is drawn in on the loins.
And the horns close in on the back and sides.
Finish.
It looks jolly simple, doesn't it?
Though it's jolly deadly, old boy.
Well done, Adendorff.
We'll make an Englishman of you yet.
No, thanks. I'm a Boer.
The Zulus are the enemies of my blood.
What are you doing here?
You don't object to our help, I hope?
It all depends what you damned English want for it afterwards.
All right. Hospital. Church.
Cattle kraal. Stables.
An outside perimeter joining the buildings here and here.
Now, we don't move out to meet the feint of the buffelo head.
We hold the outside perimeter.
If and when that collapses, we move back into this area here.
How high can you build a wall there,
Bromhead?
Well, it should be about shoulder high.
But if the fuzzies moved out of Isandhlwana immediately, they could be here, well, now.
It's just a matter of time.
Now, we'll have to make the time.
You mean your only plan is to stand behind a few feet of mealie bags, and wait for the attack?
That's right. We wait.
If 1,200 men couldn't hold a defensive position this morning, what chance have we with 100?
Listen, old boy,
I'll take the company up into the hills.
I know exactly how to disperse them.
Ambush, you see?
We cut them down in the passes.
Bromhead?
I want that line of boxes across here, from the cattle kraal to the outside perimeter.
And if they get over this, redoubt.
And a final redoubt here.
That, put it in the middle.
What are you doing in here?
This is a church!
Don't you realise, this is an altar table?
I'm sorry. There's nothing larger.
We need it now.
And there's no chloroform.
Go to the hospital.
Tell the sick to be ready to leave.
I want water, cold water, lots of it, a probe, a saw, some nitric acid.
Don't take it too badly, Mr Witt.
Isn't this as good a place as any for a man to be when he's in pain?
Excuse me, sir.
Tuck your heads in afore they fall off.
Sorry, sir. I have orders to get some of these bags outside.
All right, get on with it.
I was praying that your officer may turn to God's word.
That's right, sir. A prayer's as good as a bayonet on a day like this.
- Have you prayed?
- There'll be a time for it, sir.
What will you say?
Pick it up.
Bit of the Psalms, I suppose, sir.
My father was a lay preacher.
A great one for the Psalms, he was.
There was one that might have been written for a soldier.
Say it, man. Lift your voice to God.
- Now, sir?
- Yes. Let them hear your voice.
They know my voice when they hear it, sir.
Let them hear it now in praise of the Lord.
Call upon him.
Call upon him, man, for your salvation.
Well, as far as I can remember, sir, it goes something like this.
"He maketh wars to cease in all the world,
"he breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder."
Do you know it, sir?
"I shall be exalted among the heathen,
"I shall be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us."
That's it, sir.
All right.
Nobody told you to stop working.
You lead-backsided. Get sweating.
I've been sitting there thinking.
I've got it all sorted out.
Company!
What are you doing here, Miss?
He doesn't need any help.
I'll look after him.
Won't I?
You are all to be evacuated soon in the wagons.
- Who says?
- My father.
That's nice, isn't it? Your father.
You and me, Hookie.
Mr Chard's orders. In this room.
Here we are.
Hey, what are you talking about?
I'm sick. I'm excused duty.
What are you doing?
I'm making a loophole, see?
Me and Hookie's gonna fight in here.
Aren't we, Hookie?
You're joking! I'm sick.
Nobody's got any right to ask me to muck around in a flaming battle.
I'm getting out.
- Private Hook!
- Yes?
Yes, Sergeant.
I know you, Hook.
Yeah, you ought to.
You're no good, Hook.
They gave us you because you are no good to anyone except the Queen and Sgt Maxfield.
Thank you very much, the both of you.
Take this rifle, Hook, and get to it!
I'll make a soldier of you yet.
And what for? Did I ever see a Zulu walk down the City Road? No!
So what am I doing here?
- You are here because you were a thief.
- Yeah.
- And you still are one...
- Certainly.
...Hook, my lad.
And now, you can be a soldier, like what they pay you for.
Look, you got me 28 days' field punishment in Brecon.
Isn't that enough?
Pick up the bayonet and help Williams.
And put your tunic on!
28 days' field punishment. No pay.
You know what he did?
Sent money to my missus.
What did you do that for?
You hate him for it?
What do you want me to do?
Cry me heart out?
Give him a big kiss?
I thought you might pray for him.
Oh, she's a dry one. Very cool.
You know what she needs.
Play your cards right, and it could be you.
Can I help anyone?
There will be wagons soon to take you away.
He's dying. There's nothing you can do.
Nothing?
There must be.
- 'Shun!
- Now pay attention.
Is there any walking sick without rifles?
Me.
You, Dutchy?
You couldn't walk to the latrine.
This is not my first action. Come on.
Are you expecting sick men to fight?
What's he going to do, 593?
Oh, I think he wants to be a hero, 716.
Haven't you red necks got names instead of numbers?
This is a Welsh regiment, man.
Though there are some foreigners from England in it, mind.
I am Jones from Bwlchgwyn.
He is Jones from Builth Wells.
There are four more Joneses in C Company.
Confusing, isn't it, Dutchy?
What's your name, then?
It's Schiess. And I'm not Dutch.
I'm Swiss.
Well, there's a silly man, by damn.
He's got himself into a private war.
I belong to Natal Mounted Police.
Is that true, then? He's a peeler, 716.
Come to arrest the Zulus.
What do you know about Zulus?
Bunch of savages, isn't it?
All right, how far can you red necks march in a day?
Oh, 15, 20 miles, is it?
A Zulu regiment can run, run, 50 miles and fight a battle at the end of it.
Well, there's daft, it is then.
I don't see no sense in running to fight a battle.
What are you doing here in such a time like this? Why don't you go?
No. Not until you have gone.
You know Cetshwayo has a regiment of young girls, warriors, called Ripen At Noon.
There's pretty.
Hey, come on. Come on. Here.
Here! Here! Give us... Come on.
Come on. Just a little kiss?
Hey! Yeah! Come on!
Hey. Hey, boys! Take a look at this.
- What is it, boyo?
- Flaming dust. What else?
No, by damn, it's horses!
The cavalry!
Yeah. It's a relief column, you long-range sniper, you.
Colour Sergeant?
Sir?
Stephenson, Durnford's Horse.
- Thank God you're here.
- I'm surprised you're still here.
You know there are 4,000 Zulus coming this way?
We know. Can you throw out your men in a screen to the south of here?
You know how the Zulus feel about cavalry.
I know how my men feel about Zulus.
We've only just got through them.
- Stephenson.
- Bromhead. What price, this?
I know your whole regiment's gone.
Bromhead? You know this man.
Tell him we need him.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look at my men.
Stand fast. Stand fast, all of you!
Where the hell are they going?
Get them back here!
- Let go of my bridle!
- Get them back here!
If they're going to die, they'll die on their own farms.
You're the professionals.
You fight here if you want to.
We need you! Don't go! Don't go! Stay!
We need you, damn you! We need you!
You didn't say a single word to help, Bromhead.
Oh, when you take command, old boy, you're on your own.
The first lesson the General, my grandfather, ever taught me.
All right, then.
Nobody told you to stop working.
Brothers! Oh, brothers!
The way of the Lord has been shown to us.
"Thou shalt not kill," saith the Lord.
Brothers! Oh, brothers!
God's love is peace.
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Go in peace!
Stay not to kill and be killed. Go, I say.
The sin of Cain will be upon you.
"Am I my brother's keeper?" asked Cain.
Yea, we are all our brother's keeper.
"The nations are but a drop of a bucket,
"and are counted as the small dust of the balance."
Bring him along.
Mr Witt, I'm getting you off this post.
Sir, they've all hopped it. All of them.
Give me those wagons and I will save the sick.
You want the wagons?
Mr Bourne? Windridge?
Get those wagons in.
Sir.
God loves a sinner come to his understanding.
Hey, we're in luck.
Hey, looks like the old parson got Chard to let us go.
Heave!
Right, lads. Heave.
Heave.
Oh, Lord, God, give me strength!
Oh, God! God forgive me.
I have the strength of thousands while the spirit of God is with me.
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Sir.
Oh, God, forgive me.
Get him away from here.
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!
Miss Witt!
Animals! All of you! Animals!
- Sgt Woodridge.
- Sir!
We shall not go. If you send us away, we shall come back.
Lock him up. Lock him in the storeroom.
- Put a man on the door.
- Sir.
All right, you men, get back to work.
And you.
Put Miss Witt in the church with Surgeon Reynolds.
Sir.
It was sad, you know. And sick.
Had a battle coming, see?
Animals are very sensitive to noise, you know.
Why worry about a calf?
I thought I was tired of farming.
No adventure in it.
But when you look at it, this country's not a bit as good as Bala and the lake there.
Not really green, like.
And the soil.
There's no moisture in it.
Nothing to hold a man in his grave.
Chard? One of my men, Hook.
- Do you know him?
- No.
In the hospital, malingering, under arrest.
He's a thief, a coward and an insubordinate barrack-room lawyer.
- And you've given him a rifle.
- What?
In Queen's regulations, it specifically states...
Damn funny.
Like a... Like a train in the distance.
You were saying about Hook?
Mr Bromhead, sir? Sentries come in from the hill. They say...
- Colour Sergeant?
- Sir.
- You have something to report?
- Sir?
Then tell me.
Very good, sir.
The sentries report Zulus to the southwest, thousands of them.
All right, Colour Sergeant, stand to.
Stand to!
Look to your front. Mark the orders.
Mark the target when it comes.
Look to your front.
Mark your target when it comes.
Look to your front.
Look to your front.
Mark your target when it comes.
Mark your target. Look to your front.
- Hitch, do your tunic up.
- My tunic?
Do it up.
Where do you think you are, man?
Look to your front.
Mark your target when it comes.
To your front.
- Mark your target when it comes.
- Look to your front.
Mark the orders.
Mark your target when it comes.
- Look to your front.
- Mark your target when it comes.
Boy? You hear me, boy?
Will you be Cain and kill your brother?
"Thou shalt not kill," saith the Lord.
You believe in the Lord's word, don't you?
Obey the word, boy. Obey the Lord.
Go to the others.
Boy, go to the others.
He's...
- Mr Witt says...
- Never mind him, boy.
Now, you get along back to the ramparts with your mates.
Yes, sir.
Mr Witt, sir? Be quiet now, will you?
There's a good gentleman.
You'll upset the lads.
- You know my father was at Waterloo.
- He was?
He got his colonelcy after that.
Did he?
And my great-grandfather, he was the Johnny who knelt beside Wolfe at Quebec.
Did they make him a colonel too?
No, you don't see what I'm driving at.
You're telling me you're the professional, I'm the amateur.
No. What I mean is...
I mean, I wish right now,
I were a damned ranker, like Hook or Hitch.
You're not, are you?
You're an officer and a gentleman.
Listen.
That damned train again.
"He breaketh the bow and snappeth the spear in sunder!"
"I will be exalted among the heathen.
"I will be exalted in the earth.
"The Lord of hosts is with us."
I hope so. As I live and die, I hope so.
Company will fix bayonets!
Fix!
Bayonets!
Attention!
You slovenly soldier, Hitch.
Load!
North rampart, stand fast!
South rampart at 100 yards!
Volley fire!
Present!
Fire!
Reload!
Fire!
Reload!
Independent, fire at will!
That's very nice of him.
They're just standing there asking for it.
Keep firing, soldier.
Mark your targets before you fire.
Adendorff, what's wrong with them?
- Why don't they fight?
- They're counting your guns.
What?
Can't you see that old boy up on the hill?
He's counting your guns.
Testing your firing power with the lives of his warriors.
Cease firing!
- Well?
- They'll be back.
Stand fast!
Sixty. We dropped at least 60, wouldn't you say?
That leaves only 3,940.
"Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
"Behold, thou art fair, my love!"
How long?
Ten, 15 minutes. Maybe less.
As soon as they've regrouped.
"Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,
"and thy speech is comely."
He can't be!
He is. Drunk as a Lord.
- Fifteen minutes.
- If we're lucky.
Colour Sergeant Bourne?
"Many waters cannot quench love,
"neither can the floods drown it."
Yes, sir, the gentleman has a bottle.
Then get him out of here.
Put him on his cart.
Tie him on if necessary.
The sooner we get rid of them the better.
Sir.
Chard. They won't stand a chance with the Zulus.
They're Witt's parishioners, aren't they?
But the woman, do you want to see her killed?
Do you, Bromhead?
Because you will if we don't get them out of here.
Come along, sir.
There's a good gentleman.
All right, pick him up.
"I have sinned against heaven, and before thee."
Oh, no!
Father!
"Peace be within thy walls..."
Father!
Keep driving with the sun at your back.
You should make it safely.
Sergeant!
- Father!
- Leave me alone!
Try to understand him, Miss Witt.
Death awaits you!
You have made a covenant with death and with hell you are in agreement!
You're all going to die!
Don't you realise?
Can't you see?
You're all going to die!
Die!
- Death awaits you all!
- He's right.
Die!
Why is it us?
- Die!
- Why us?
Because we're here, lad, and nobody else.
Just us.
Colour Sergeant.
Right, now get back to your posts.
At the double.
Here they come again!
Volley!
Fire!
- I can't see a bloody one now.
- They've gone to ground.
Reload!
There they go!
Eyes front. Look to the front!
What the devil's going on?
Well, tell me what's happening.
I've got to know.
They're on both sides!
We haven't enough men at the north wall.
Can't you take some from the south?
How will we hold that if we do?
Damn it, Adendorff, you're supposed to know.
Are they going to hit us everywhere at once?
I told you, remember.
The horns of the buffelo.
The south could have been a feint.
We can't man the whole perimeter.
We've got to outgun them somewhere.
Right?
All right, Bromhead, take men from the south, one section in three.
Reinforce the north wall.
But if they do come from the south again?
Get on with it, Mr Bromhead.
At the double.
Colour Sergeant Bourne,
I want every other man from sections one, three and five over at the north wall.
Come on, then, at the double.
First two.
Follow me.
Where would you like me?
You pick your own ground.
It's your country, isn't it?
Hey, who left the door open?
Blazes!
Where the deuce did they get those?
I'd say, off the bodies of your regiment at Isandhlwana.
Now, that's a bitter pill, our own damn rifles!
Keep your heads down.
- Corporal Allen!
- Sir.
- This is your section now.
- Sir.
Well, see, if you can keep the heads of those marksmen down.
Can't see none of them, sir.
You should know, Corporal Allen, fire at the smoke.
- Keep them pinned down, not us.
- Sir.
Fire at the smoke.
Mr Bromhead!
- Not the best of shots, are they?
- Get a platoon together.
I'll need more than one, old boy, if I'm going up there after them.
You're not going up there after them.
Get a platoon of good bayonet men.
Take them head on at anything that breaks through where our lines weaken.
- It's still a holding action, is it?
- That's right.
Your job is to plug the gaps from the inside.
- And get yourself a good sergeant.
- Yes, sir!
Hitch! Get down from there!
How can I shoot them if I can't see them?
- Hitch!
- My leg! Corp!
Corp?
Can I undo my tunic buttons now, can I, Corp?
Stretcher bearers!
Come on, attack, damn you!
Here they come!
North wall, volley fire! Present!
At 100 yards!
Fire!
Reload!
Independent, fire at will!
- Bromhead!
- Follow me!
Bromhead!
Mr Chard, I'll get you help.
Keep our squad on the wall, Sergeant.
Chard! Are you all right?
Take command.
Corporal!
You're the professional.
- Take command.
- Lance Corporal!
Now, listen, old boy, you're not badly hurt.
We need you!
Damn you, we need you. Understand?
Get him to Surgeon Reynolds.
Take command. You want it, don't you?
- Sergeant Windridge!
- Sir!
Scalpel.
Orderly, damn it!
Will you keep the flies away!
Fan it!
Damn you, Chard!
Damn all you butchers!
Why? Why?
Why?
- Why?
- It's all right, boy, you sleep.
I'm damned if I can tell you why.
You know this boy?
Name of Cole, sir.
He was a paperhanger.
He's a dead paperhanger now.
Orderlies!
Are you all right?
There they go, boys. After them!
Stand fast! They're retiring, sir.
North wall, hold your fire.
Down!
What is it now? Another blasted trick?
They're forming up on the south plain again, sir.
I knew it! I knew it! They're going to attack both walls at once.
I doubt it, not unless they have no other choice anyhow.
It could mean the old general couldn't use his rifles on the hill side for fear of hitting down to his own men.
This way, he keeps probing for weaknesses on the one wall while he keeps the other one pinned down.
Oh, yes.
They're on the move, sir!
North wall, keep those riflemen on the hill side pinned down.
South wall, volley fire!
Present!
Fire!
Reload!
- Hookie, come on, boy, do something!
- I'm excused duty.
- Well, I haven't excused you, have I?
- You want some help.
Well, why didn't you say so?
This rifle! Honestly, I can't manage it.
Now, now, you heard what the officer said. Come on.
But if it really came down to it, sir,
I couldn't really shoot anyone.
Careful! Pop that chap, somebody!
Good fellow. Good fellow. You see?
Sir!
Sir.
Now, you're doing fine.
Where...
You want to rest here a bit?
Watch it!
Can you move your leg?
- If you want me to dance.
- I want you to crawl.
Come on, you slovenly soldier, we've got work to do.
It's all right, sir, we'll do that for you.
I'm all right.
You better get along to the surgeon, sir.
I'll try to get someone to help you, sir.
I can manage.
Here.
Hold them! Hold them!
Hey, Noel, Tommy, look!
Oh, my God!
Bromhead, reorganise your flying platoon with Sgt Windridge.
But I... Yes, sir, of course.
Sir.
- Well done, Corporal. Stand by.
- Sir.
Colour Sergeant Bourne!
Sir? Are you all right, sir?
Thank you, Mr Bourne.
The men on the church roof, have them support your fire against the hillside.
- Corporal?
- Sir.
Section on the roof, bring your rifles about on the hillside.
Fire at the smoke.
- The men on the hospital loopholes...
- Sir.
...they've nothing to fire at.
Bring them to the front windows to support the north wall.
Sir.
Colour Sergeant?
- Sir.
- I want half your men now.
An even number, sir?
- Form two lines on the double.
- Sir!
Company!
Fall back! Clear the line of fire!
Front rank! Fire!
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!
Rear rank!
Fire! Advance!
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!
Rear rank!
Fire! Advance!
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!
Rear rank!
Fire! Advance!
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!
Rear rank!
Fire! Advance!
Independent, fire at will!
Cease firing!
- Hey, Thomas. There's some water.
- Oh, thank God!
- Hey, 470 Davies was hit, you know.
- No!
Aye, in the throat.
What a pity.
The man is a great bass baritone.
In the throat, is it?
Aye.
Hey, where are you going?
I'm going to see that calf, man.
Hey, come back, you fool!
What are you doing?
Tommy!
Mr Bourne, there should be 12 more men working on this redoubt.
They're very tired, sir.
I don't give a damn.
I want this nine foot high, firing steps inside.
Form details to clear away the Zulu bodies.
Rebuild the south ramparts.
Keep them moving.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.
All right, lads, keep it moving.
We're next, boys. This is the blind spot.
Even if those flaming officers ain't seen it, I bet the Zulus have.
- Come on, Howarth, put your money up.
- Have you gone stupid?
What bloody good you think it will do you if you do win?
We're all goners!
Well, it don't matter if you lose, does it?
Hey, Hookie.
Hughsie.
There's some brandy in Reynolds' medical cabinet, go and borrow some.
- It's locked up down that end.
- Kick it down, then.
Hey, that's company punishment.
Company punishment.
On the right.
Form close columns of platoons.
- By the right!
- You lucky bastard!
Oh dear. Oh dear.
Well, your mum will need somebody to milk her now, won't she?
Stand to!
All right, all right, I can hear you.
Out you get, Hookie, you've done your bit.
Quick! Thousands of them! 612!
Knock a hole in that wall!
Better get down now, sir.
Sir!
Get down now, sir!
No! Jones, it's me!
Come on, get through, you bloody Englishman!
Get out! Get out! Get out!
Jonesy!
Come on up!
Get to Surgeon Reynolds.
Right, get on the wall.
Hook!
I know you!
What about the money you sent my old woman?
Hook!
That's it, Hook, my lad!
That's it, soldier!
Hookie!
Stay where you are, Maxfield!
Hookie! Hookie!
Get out! Get out, man.
That's my boy, Hook!
You're a soldier now!
I've made a soldier of you!
Where's my bloody sergeant?
Get out! Come on!
- Is everybody out?
- Yes, sir.
On the wall.
Hookie? Where's Hookie? Hookie?
Come down, Hookie! Hookie!
Hookie! That's a flogging offence!
Get out, for God's sake, man!
- Everybody out?
- Everybody that will get out.
- Abandon the outside ramparts.
- Bugler! Retire to this wall!
- Colour Sergeant.
- Sir.
- Carry on building the inner redoubt.
- Sir!
All right, nobody told you to stop working!
Look at that.
- Do you think he wanted it that way?
- Look at it burn!
Any more in there?
Then we'll have to take them from the outside walls.
- Colour Sergeant Bourne.
- Sir?
Hey, Owen?
- Are you awake, man?
- What is it?
I didn't think it was going to die though.
- Can you see something?
- No, the calf, I'm talking about.
There's sorry I am.
Aye.
Seems a pity, doesn't it?
How many times have they come since sunset do you reckon?
I don't know.
Do you reckon they'll come again?
I think they've got more guts than we have, boyo.
Soldiers!
All right, back to your posts.
You, hold there.
Orderly, see to these men.
Colour Sergeant.
Put a third of our men in the redoubt.
Send the bugler to me.
I was asleep, sir.
You let me sleep?
You shouldn't have done that.
Is there any water?
I sent what was left to Reynolds.
Yes, of course.
It's fear dries the mouth, isn't it?
When a man's as thirsty as this.
I could have drunk a river.
Thank you for what you said.
Oh, you mean about our needing you?
Yes. Don't bother, old boy, it's true.
Sir?
Come with me.
Get in the redoubt, my lucky lads.
Make a move.
Come on. Come on.
All right, lads, take up your positions on the firing step.
Keep your heads down.
- How old are you, boy?
- Sir?
It doesn't matter.
You know how to sound?
Yes, sir.
Stay by me.
Do you think the Welsh can't do better than that, Owen?
Well, they've got a very good bass section, mind, but no top tenors, that's for sure.
Men of Harlech stop your dreaming
Can't you see their spear points gleaming
See their warrior pennants streaming
To this battlefield
Sing!
Men of Harlech stand ye steady
Come on, sing!
It cannot be ever said ye
For the battle were not ready
Welshmen never yield
The mighty force surrounding
Men of Harlech on to glory
This will ever be your story
Keep these burning words before ye
Welshmen will not yield
At 100 yards!
Volley fire! Present!
Aim! Fire!
Right, stand by. Lips dry?
- Sergeant!
- Prepare!
Now!
Spit, boy, spit!
Redoubt party!
Fire!
Volley by ranks!
Front rank, fire!
Second rank, fire!
Third rank, fire!
First rank, fire!
Second rank, fire!
Third rank, fire!
First rank, fire!
Second rank, fire!
Third rank, fire!
Fire! Fire!
Cease firing!
Three hours and they haven't come again.
Mr Chard, sir.
The patrol's come back.
The Zulus have gone. All of them.
It's a miracle!
If it's a miracle, Colour Sergeant, it's a short chamber
Boxer-Henry.45 calibre miracle.
And a bayonet, sir, with some guts behind it.
- Fall them in. Call the roll.
- Sir.
Well, you did it.
Me?
- Abel?
- Sir.
Adams?
Adam?
- Barry?
- Sir.
- Beckett?
- He's wounded, sir.
- He's dying, sir.
- It's sad.
Keep your voices down.
Byrne?
- Camp?
- Sir.
Chick?
Cole?
- Colin.
- Sir.
- Who was left in here?
- I don't know.
They had names, they had faces.
They were our men.
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Chard!
All right.
470 Davies?
- 363 Davies?
- Sir.
Well, you've fought your first action.
Does everyone feel like this afterwards?
How do you feel?
Sick.
Well, you have to be alive to feel sick.
You asked me, I told you.
There's something else.
I feel ashamed.
Was that how it was for you?
The first time?
The first time?
You think I could stand this butcher's yard more than once?
I didn't know.
I told you.
I came up here to build a bridge.
Fagan?
Green, 459?
Sir.
- Hughes?
- Excused duty.
No comedians, please.
- Hughes?
- Yes, Colour Sergeant.
Say "sir." Officer on parade.
Sir!
Hayden?
Hitch?
Hitch, I saw you. You're alive.
I am? Oh, thanks very much.
- Answer the roll. Say "sir."
- Sir!
All right. Now get off into the sickbay where you belong.
- Hook?
- Yes, sir, me too, sir.
Stay where you are, Hook!
Well, we haven't done too badly.
Oh, my God!
Adendorff, why have they stopped?
God damn you!
- I want an answer!
- Haven't you had enough?
Both of you!
My God, can't you see it's all over!
Your bloody egos don't matter any more!
We're dead!
What are you waiting for?
Come on. Come on.
Those bastards!
They're taunting us!
No.
No. You couldn't be more wrong.
They're... They're saluting you.
They're saluting fellow braves.
They're saluting you.
Oh, my eye! Oh, my eye! Will you look!
In the 100 years since the Victoria Cross was created for valour and extreme courage beyond that normally expected of a British soldier in face of the enemy, only 1,344 have been awarded.

The carts are coming!
The carts are coming!
Marina! Agnese! The carts are coming!
The carts are coming!
Let's come and see it, girls!
The carts are coming!
What are they doing, building the scaffold?
A nice execution to watch, at last!
Unload the cart, quick.
Let's get a move on!
Come on!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Everyone back!
Stay back!
Is it true they're going to execute a Cenci?
We know even less than you, lady.
- All four of them?
- That's what I heard.
One of the priests that comforts people sentenced to death told me.
And he really mentioned the Cenci family?
Yes, two in Tor di Nona and two in Corte Savella.
Yes, that was correct.
Two in Tor di Nona and two in Corte Savella.
Some time later, the comforters went to both prisons.
One group went to Tor di Nona, where Giacomo and Bernardo
Cenci had been imprisoned.
The other group went to Corte Savella, where Beatrice and her stepmother Lucrezia were kept.
The rumors were true.
According to the customs of the time, a copy of the sentence...
...had been sent to
Prospero Farinaccio, the lawyer who had been in charge of the defence.
The eminent lawyer was now reading it to his colleagues:
Giorgio Diedi, Rutilio Altieri and Planca di Coronata.
So, it looks like that young Bernando will also have to go to the scaffold.
But only to witness the others' death.
After that he'll be locked away for one year.
And then he'll become a galley slave on the papal ships for the rest of his life.
Can this be considered an act of clemency?
His life will become a constant torment.
Death will be his only relief.
Don't get so upset, esteemed colleagues,
One can't win every case.
And you, Farinaccio, finish reading the sentence.
- Is it really necessary?
- No, it's useless.
It's always the same old story, after all.
Their total assets and goods will be seized.
That's how it works.
All their goods, their assets and their properties...
...will be confiscated and handed over to the Papal Treasury.
That's 500.000 scudi coins for the Treasury.
Beatrice is innocent!
No! No!
No!
No...
No!
No!
Yes, I understand.
The execution will be carried out tomorrow morning.
Madam, your stepmother and your sister will be beheaded.
You, Sir Giacomo Cenci, will be tortured with hot irons, bludgeoned with a mallet and then publicly quartered.
Kiss it, you wicked woman, kiss the image of our Lord Jesus Christ.
He who was innocently crucified and suffered much more than you're doing.
Ask Saint Paul to forgive your many sins, as he was also beheaded.
Beg him to assist you during your final moments.
Ask God for forgiveness.
How dare you pray so peacefully, after the terrible way you offended God?
There's no sign of remorse in your devotion.
And, without remorse, you'll be condemned for all eternity.
You're here to comfort us, brothers.
The only comfort we can give to your soul is to take it away from Satan.
God will never absolve a parricide woman who doesn't truly repent for her murder.
Ciro di Ponte should have concealed his identity.
Are you sure Ciro di Ponte is at Francesco Cenci's service?
I'm sure of it, we all recognized him.
It was him. He did it after his master ordered him to.
Cenci took the girl when she was only fourteen.
Her father found out where Cenci kept her and what she went through.
He freed her once many of us went to confront him.
But he told Tommaso he'd have made him pay for it.
Why would have he waited more than a year to do so?
Because Tommaso talked to Prince Colonna, who promised him protection.
Tommaso told Cenci who kept a low profile.
Are you going to put him in prison now?
This matter doesn't concern you.
If I were as cruel as people say,
I'd leave him to die in agony.
But I'll be merciful.
Finish him off.
Do it.
- Your Excellency...
- I guess you know nothing of his whereabouts.
- He never tells us.
- Pray we won't have to use torture to get more out of you.
Your Excellency...
A bargello officer in the Cenci's home...
What brings you here?
I'm here to arrest Lord
Francesco, your master.
Are you one of his henchmen?
I wish I could say so.
But, unfortunately, I'm...
I'm his son.
That's right.
I'm his oldest son.
I guess I'm not appropriately dressed.
But you should tell my father.
If you're able to find him.
You have the duty to collaborate with justice, even if you are his son.
Even more so then, I'd say.
Is there any child of Francesco
Cenci that loves his father?
No, my friend. He hates us all.
And we repay him with the same love.
He only spends his money to pay the scoundrels he uses for his bad deeds, just like the one he committed last night.
This time, though, he stepped on Prince Colonna's feet.
Something that'd get the pope's attention.
As long as Cenci doesn't manage to escape.
We need to strike while the iron is hot.
My father knows that, that's the reason why he left Rome.
Well, I don't want to sound like a spy, but I'd look for him around Rocca di Petrella if I were you.
Your Excellency, I bid you welcome on behalf of everyone.
I thank God for your good health, Francesco.
And do you also thank me for coming back?
- Of course.
- Then you've already lied two times.
What about you, Beatrice?
Why don't you greet me?
I bowed my head.
I believe quietly paying my respects would be more sensible.
Very good.
Always hold your viper's tongue and we'll manage to get along.
- Can I greet you, father?
- You've just done it.
And you, chaplain? Any pleas to convince me to repair the church's roof?
No, Lord Francesco. I just wanted to know about your sons living away.
Giacomo, my oldest one, is as healthy as ever.
I was talking about
Rocco and Cristoforo.
Oh, those two...
I must admit I'm quite pleased about them.
It's been a long time since they stopped constantly asking me for money.
And I hope Giacomo will follow their example.
Are they coming back from Spain?
I have no idea.
Your father fears the guards are coming here to put him in chains.
Did they talk about that in your presence?
No, they weren't aware
I was listening.
It'll be the end for you if my father finds out you told someone.
I only told you in order to make you decide what to do next.
What to do about what?
You told me about a plea you sent to the pope through your brother Giacomo.
If your father ended in prison and stopped tormenting you, would you still confine yourself in a convent?
If my father stopped tormenting us, even there I'd find more peace in a convent than anywhere else in the world.
But, madam, forgive me for saying this, life doesn't just revolves around peace.
They say it's also made of happiness and love.
Why would you be willing to give that up forever?
Olimpio, I'll never forget our friendship.
Just like I won't forget how you accepting this friendship made me feel.
For this evening, at least, let's call things by their true name.
That's impossible.
You're a Cenci and
I'm your servant.
If you read my heart and realized what I feel for you, then forget it.
I would have summoned you if you hadn't come here, because I can finally announce you some good news.
Your sister's wish will be granted.
I presented myself her plea to the pope, and he was kind enough to accept it.
You, cardinal, are the benefactor of my family.
And none is more obliged to you than my father.
Wrong, my friend.
Your father can't count on me anymore.
If that's the true reason of your visit, then destroy his illusion.
How can you believe my father sent me?
Francesco Cenci only seeks alliances with scoundrels.
I know I look like one, thanks to his stinginess, but my soul is different.
Thank God for it.
I'm just curious, but I noticed everyone in
Rome has been talking about him, lately.
I would like to know the truth about it.
The truth is that the Holy Father is outraged, and rightly so.
- They say that Colonna is fanning the pope's flames.
- The pope isn't guided...
...by Prince Colonna, but by the Holy Spirit.
It's fair, after all.
When someone breaks the rules like your father did, the culprit's punishment should set an example.
Don't get your hands dirty.
Justice will be done.
The sentence will have him shed the most bitter tears.
Look! Look if they forgot about me!
And I fell into this trap like an idiot!
What did you wanted to do?
Go into hiding?
- It's hard to live a bandit's life.
- Because you think living a...
...a prisoner's life would be easier, you idiot?
That many soldiers only to extort money from me!
I already knew one of the pope's nephews sent an architect to my vineyards...
...to study the land in order to build a villa on it!
I damn Pope Aldobrandini and all his kin!
You should damn Satan for making you sin.
And you should put Satan on an altar, as he constantly provides you with sinners.
The ones whose riches you milk.
You know that the Porta Pinciana fief accounts for a third of my fortune!
You should be thankful for that.
Once you'll be less wealthy, you'll also be less prone to commit bad deeds.
You want to make me believe that you're only trying to save my soul?
No. No.
Consider it as an extreme measure taken against your person.
As it will hurt what you love the most: your material possessions.
Due to your natural stinginess, this punishment will be harsh enough, that's what I told the pope to convince him.
But I assure you he was more inclined to imprison you.
Prison...
I already went to prison in the past!
And it cost me a lot less!
I believe that.
Impunity is much less expensive when it comes to justice's lower circles.
But the Court had to take on your case after what you did this time.
It's only natural that you'll have to pay a higher price for your crimes.
Think about it, we ask for a third of your fortune. It's not too much, after all.
That was a very difficult shot.
You're right.
And a very nice boar indeed.
You only hit it because
I missed it, though.
You've hit other targets recently, isn't that right, monsignor?
It's easy when there's so much game around.
Good for me, then, or I'd have to live on a diet of bread and water, after you leeched my money.
The bread of freedom is priceless.
You can't compare a cell at Tor di Nona or Corte Savella...
...with the woods of
Petrella and this fresh air.
Finish your business here and get me a safe conduct.
I've had enough of this fresh air!
I'm afraid the air of Rome will be unbreathable for you this whole summer.
The whole summer? You mean
I can't return to Rome?
Wasn't taking my money enough?
You want to exile me now?
To each his own, my friend.
The fief of Porta Pinciana will be given to the Treasury.
But the people will ask for something.
They don't ask for much, those poor people.
Not seeing you for a while will be enough for them.
Very well.
But I want to make this clear...
- It'll only be until autumn.
- Your Excellency...
I want to be there when the pope's nephew...
...will lay the first stone of his new villa.
Any more bad news, monsignor, or was this the last one?
Beatrice's calling should make you happy, as much as it pleased the pope.
Is that a wish or an order?
The difference is minimal, seeing that it's coming from the Holy Father.
He's really overdoing it!
He takes a third of my fortune, he forces me to stay here for the whole summer...
...and now he wants me to renounce to my beloved daughter, who has insanely thought to spend her life chanting in a convent.
If the pope needs more nuns, why doesn't he spawn a daughter and send her to a convent?
The angels are deaf to your profanities.
Because both you and them don't want to listen!
You'll tell the pope he can count, as always, on the obedience of his devoted servant Francesco Cenci.
You sent a plea to the "holy fool" to have me allow you to join a convent.
Well, I gave my word I'd have granted your wish.
Come in.
Get in!
Have a good look.
It's not that different from a convent cell.
Something missing?
Yes, something's missing.
A crucifix.
You'll have one.
And you'll stay here until the day I die.
How did the master die?
A tragedy. He fell from a parapet.
A parapet of the walls outside, close to the ditch.
You returned in time to attend the funeral.
Even a Cenci wouldn't survive that kind of jump.
When did it happen?
The other night. People say he had drunk a lot.
Perhaps he leaned on the parapet...
...as he was trying to get some fresh air.
The railing broke and he fell.
This wood isn't rotten.
That isn't an important detail, in my opinion.
Sometimes wood breaks even if it isn't rotten, you know.
Right.
What are you doing with that coat?
Give, it's mine!
- It's mine!
- Stop! It's so beautiful!
You gave it to me as a gift!
No...
Catalan!
Do you hear me, Catalan?
Wake up!
Get up!
Get up!
Catalan, it's me, Olimpio.
Do you recognize me?
- I told you he was a bandit!
- I'm afraid, let's leave!
Are you listening now?
Are you listening?
Gasparo returned today.
He's suspicious, he even left already.
We're afraid, we must follow him.
- Which road did he take?
- The one to Rome.
It's not for me.
Too many guards over there.
I hope two esteemed men like you will forgive me, but, given my physical constitution, I'm practically done for if the fire goes out.
So, the Cenci family, as I was telling you, and I mean the widow and her two stepsons, came to Rome in late October.
Lord Francesco died in mid-September, it seems.
Barely the time to deal with the luggage.
This detail is also mentioned in the denunciation letter.
Can I see it?
But we told you all the essential facts.
I know, but I'm just curious about the writing style.
You're tasked with finding the culprits, if there are any, not who wrote the letter.
Of course, Your
Excellency, of course.
However, if I managed to find out who's against the Cenci family...
It's not necessary to be an enemy of the
Cenci in order to be a friend of justice.
Naturally, of course.
But no one would write an anonymous letter without something in return.
And it looks like the work of a man of letters, and, if you want my humble opinion,
I don't think it could have been done by someone uneducated.
- I think you'll solve this riddle going to Rocca di Petrella.
- Yes, without a doubt!
Of course, I'll have to get there...
With this cold weather...
With the bandits...
- I'd require an escort...
- You'll leave as soon as possible.
Your Excellency, I only require the time to prepare my clothes.
There's already snow in the
Apennines during November.
It makes me really ill.
Very well, go prepare your clothes.
But try not to take the whole winter for that, understand?
Your excellencies...
Shouldn't we have put the case in the hands of a more vigorous bargello officer?
You don't know him. Let him work his own way.
Here.
Crossing the Apennines in this freezing cold...
Yes, indeed.
A bloodstained sheet.
Lady Beatrice sent it to a washerwoman.
Did you know about this?
No, sir.
I'm the bargello officer, you see...
Nobody tells a bargello officer anything.
People feel more inclined to talk to a stranger, someone who's just passing by, like...
...a merchant, a tooth-puller or a coal-man.
People confess everything to those kind of fellows.
That's the reason why
I never rush a case.
First, I send a few of my men.
Disguised, of course.
Disguised as coal-men, merchants or tooth-pullers.
Get it?
So, when I arrive, I already know a lot of things.
Then, bargello, you probably know a lot more than I do about this story.
No, I don't think so.
- I reckon you know more than anyone.
- No, I assure you...
Yes, yes. You and your bandit friend, the one with the coat. What's his name again?
A bandit with a coat?
I don't know anything.
After Cenci's death, people saw said bandit going around wearing a very familiar coat.
A coat that belonged to the deceased.
Moreover, the bandit started spending quite freely.
How did he manage to get rich so suddenly?
Do you know anything about it?
I believe you're talking about
Marzio Floriani, is that right?
The one they call "the Catalan".
Of course. I haven't seen him in a long time.
You're lying again.
- No, I...
- You were seen together multiple times.
Two whores claim you went looking for him in the cave he uses as a hideout.
I guess you had a good reason to go there.
Why don't you tell me?
We'll see if the Catalan will be as quiet as you are.
Search the area!
There he is! After him!
Too bad the bargello wanted him alive.
Rope torture would make a mute speak, you know.
You have a working tongue, use it.
Harder.
Stop! Stop!
Stop!
Stop...
Stop!
Pull him down.
Water.
Is this the prisoner they brought from Petrella?
Yes, Your Excellency, the one involved in the Cenci case.
He's stubborn, Your Excellency.
Very much so.
How much rope torture did he endure?
A lot. His shoulders are broken.
Try something different.
If you had any common sense, you'd make the clerk work instead of us.
Some moments of happiness are so precious one'd pay them with his own life.
But my life wouldn't be worth enough to buy back your love.
I wish a good greater than life existed.
In order for you to ask me to gift it to you.
This good exists.
Tell me what it is.
I could only tell you if I didn't love you.
Forget that you love me, then.
Whatever this thing is, remember that I'm ready to give my life for you.
It's impossible, Olimpio.
No one can dispose of his life against God's will.
People can sacrifice their life out of love.
But only their earthly life.
Not their eternal life.
Heaven is what you're giving me here on this earth.
But is it worth eternal damnation?
It would mean damning your soul forever, if I begged you...
...to free me from the
Hell on earth I'm enduring.
How can I free you?
There's only one way.
It happened the day after the cardinal left.
Your father was furious over your sister's wish to become a nun...
...and locked her in a dungeon.
And I know why he let her out of it.
Yes. And that's why your sister decided to...
What I mean is, this is why...
...your sister developed this terrible desire.
I know what she asked you to do, if that's what you're trying to tell me.
I already talked to Beatrice.
It was the right thing to do.
I'm the older brother, I had to give her my opinion.
And you... What's your opinion on this matter, then?
Since we're talking about my father,
I don't see anything terrible about this desire.
You'll have to handle it by yourselves.
I'll be in Rome.
My presence would just arouse suspicions.
Why should we wait until early September?
Because that's when Lord Francesco collects the money from his fief in Calabria.
He'll send a loyal henchman named
Gasparo who's always by his side.
Gasparo's presence could make things more complicated, you get it?
Very well.
Sir Giacomo!
Take this.
It's just a little advance.
You'll get more once the job's done.
I'm ready whenever you want.
You can find me here.
Over there.
Come.
I'll signal you from that window.
He didn't drink more than he usually does.
It's nothing.
He's more tired than usual, perhaps.
Go get some sleep.
- Shall we remove his clothes?
- No.
It's better to leave him alone.
Cover him.
Now.
Why the nails?
You can't use a knife if you want to make it look like an accident.
Olimpio!
One nail for you, the other for me.
You have to do it alone, that's why we're paying you! Go on!
Come on!
Just do it!
I killed many, but never anyone sleeping.
It's easier this way!
Use it as your advantage! Go on!
It's an act of cowardice.
So?
He says he can't kill a man in his sleep.
If my father were awake, you wouldn't even be brave enough to look him in the face.
And you think of yourselves as men?
If you're such cowards,
I'll do it myself.
No, not you.
We'll do it.
Go, then.
Let's go.
You too.
I did it.
I'm going on the parapet.
No...
I'm taking this, he won't need it anymore.
Hurry up, now.
We have to wrap in a sheet and carry him on the parapet.
Hurry!
Bernardo!
Give us a hand.
What's the boy doing here?
"Then we threw the body from the parapet,"
"to make it look like Cenci fell when the wood broke."
"Everything went exactly as planned."
Olimpio Calvetti's confession condemns you.
Thanks to him, we know that you're guilty, too.
- That man is insane.
- You dare deny your crime?
I deny. I deny.
I don't know anything about what happened.
Me and the others have been told that my father died after falling from a parapet.
Are you also denying you and Calvetti were lovers, like he claimed?
It wouldn't be the first time a servant bragged about this kind of thing.
We'll see who's lying between you two.
This lady refutes your confession.
She says you're the sole culprit.
She claims to be innocent and as pure as a lily flower.
She told you the truth.
What? What did you say?
Speak up, I can't hear you.
Speak. Say what you have to say.
I seek your forgiveness, lady, from the bottom of my soul, for all the lies I said.
Forgive me.
I feel ashamed of not having been able to endure the pain...
...thus telling them all sort of lies.
The sort of lies the magistrates wanted to hear.
You scoundrel!
You're mocking us!
I declare that the lady is innocent.
And I call God, our
Lord, as my only judge.
Leave God out of this.
Retracting your confession was blasphemous enough.
I'm the sole murderer of Francesco Cenci.
I deny with all my strength of having murdered him through his daughter's will.
Take her away.
She really bewitched you!
You don't even realize she gave you her body like a morsel thrown to a dog!
Your mere illusion of love only made a tool out of you!
And yet you want to save her!
She didn't give me neither her body nor illusions.
She didn't lie about me.
But I lied to you.
Before or after, you lied for sure.
You gave us two truths.
But only the first one can be true!
And you're going to repeat it, word after word!
This is nothing compared to what you'll suffer in Hell if you keep not talking.
It's useless.
He's already there, making the comparison.
Scoundrels!
How dare someone do such a thing to a servant of the pope's nephew.
It's just like offending the pope himself!
I know this man.
He was with the Aldobrandini family for about a year.
I see. I doubt his master won't be pleased to hear that...
...that he impaled himself on a blade after falling off a carriage.
He previously served the Cenci family.
What was his name?
Gasparo, right?
He was also at
Rocca di Petrella.
Plenty of things to tell his new master, I reckon.
Then, he just became useless.
Give him a burial.
He died after falling off a carriage.
But he has a wound on his back...
Well, it's not uncommon, nowadays in
Rome, to impale yourself on a blade...
...after falling off a carriage.
Write the report as I said, then recite the Act of Contrition.
An officer should never be that suspicious.
People who don't confess their sins keep them locked inside their souls, and thus they will face God as sinners.
What else could God do other than hand you to the devils...
...who will keep on tormenting you for all eternity?
Have pity on your soul, even if you have none for your flesh.
Speak!
Speak, come on!
It's not innocence making you so strong, but it's Satan himself!
All this suffering is useless, dear sister.
Because we've been much weaker than you.
If it must happen like this, so be it.
It's not my fault...
It's them that...
...wanted to cover our family name in shame.
I would have died a hundred times under torture, always denying, denying until my last breath of life.
But if I have to endure the infamy...
...of being condemned as a parricide, then I'm compelled to reveal you the secret...
...that I was adamant to take to my grave.
You're free to leave, gorgeous lady!
After you!
Did you hear me? You're free!
Come see the light outside, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Seeing the daylight after such a long time will do you good.
You weren't expecting this, huh?
Your father was so happy that a certain thing happened that he forgave you.
Where are the women?
My friends, the profit I recently made was so good it called for a celebration.
As a matter of fact, despite what the chaplain might say, money is the real staple to human happiness.
My profit revolves around an income, let's call it that way, that I'll keep on receiving as long as
I'll be living in this valley of tears, which only money can make more worth living.
If my dear chaplain doesn't mind it, of course.
Step in, girls! Come on!
Come to us!
Not bad at all.
Come.
Move it.
Look what I got here for you, look at this beauty!
Show us your goods!
There's a thousand ways to make money!
Imagine you had a hole in your pocket for years, without even realizing it.
And the day you finally mend it, you find yourself way richer!
Way richer with the money you'd have continued to lose...
...if you didn't mend that hole in your pocket.
Sit down and show us!
Yes, like this! Show us what you look like!
It's fair, don't you think?
Isn't it fair to call this an income?
Don't cry, mother, it'd make him mad.
Where's Beatrice?
Upstairs. She's dressing up just like you ordered.
You didn't tell her the true reason behind this celebration, right?
I did.
You idiotic beast!
I was waiting for her before announcing the good news!
You could have told me.
Oh, really? It's useless to keep them curious, then!
Friends, I'll now tell you the reason behind this little celebration.
I heard that my second and third sons, Rocco and Cristoforo, won't ever come back from Salamanca.
That's because they both died of smallpox.
Let's celebrate!
A good christian should always be grateful to God for his kindness.
You get it? I have two less useless mouths to feed, both gone in a single strike!
That's one big burden off my shoulders!
Heaven itself mended the hole in my pocket!
You're the most ungrateful daughter there is.
I cancel your punishment,
I even invite you to my celebration to share my happiness...
...and yet you dare to appear wearing those jinxed clothes.
You're ungrateful.
And you're also impudent!
I'm only a sister who mourns her brothers by wearing black.
You chose the wrong time and the wrong place to wear black.
Go change your clothes, you black harbinger of bad luck.
Dress up accordingly for a celebration.
And make yourself beautiful.
Your two sons are dead, a toast to us.
What are you doing still dressed like that?
Answer me.
What did I tell you to do?
If seeing my mourning dress offends you that much, why don't you send me back to where I was?
I told you to take this dress off and to wear your best one.
Obey me!
No!
No!
If, in that very moment, she had a weapon in her hands...
...and used it to kill that monster, wouldn't all of you have acquitted her without hesitation?
Wouldn't you have recognized and admitted...
...that she was only defending her honor and purity?
Sure! That animal deserved to die!
She did the right thing!
Everyone in Rome agrees.
- Everyone who?
- Well, the people... The citizens.
And since when the people are allowed to judge cases?
It'd make things much easier for us lawyers.
They believe everything
Beatrice said.
- They'd make her a saint!
- But that's the truth!
She's a saint!
The truth...
Do you always tell the truth if you swear on a crucifix?
What wouldn't any of us swear under those circumstances, in order to save our life?
What I know is that all the Cenci are accused of the murder.
And when an entire family gets condemned, the Apostolic Chamber seizes all their fortune.
And the Cenci family owns a substantial fortune.
It's about 500.000 scudi coins.
"Her honor and purity..."
Well...
When some disgraced individual breaks the limits that nature and God...
...imposed between a father and his daughter, when said father doesn't love his daughter, because he wants to ravish her flesh and soul, doesn't this man deserve to die?
Pray for your soul.
May God have mercy on you.
Is everything going as decided in the sentence?
Yes, Your Holiness. The condemned are at church and almost finished attending mass.
They'll get on the scaffold after that.
Giacomo first, then
Lucrezia and Beatrice.
The citizens are all very moved.
And so are we.
That's why we ordered you to do that thing.
It will be done.
I posted two men on the parapet of Castel Sant'Angelo.
They'll signal you with a torch once Beatrice will be beheaded.
And in that very moment we'll absolve her soul.
Leave us alone.
According to the chroniclers of the time, that the pope was surprised and even appalled...
...to hear that
Beatrice's body, brought that night to the church of San Pietro in Montorio, had been followed by a great crowd of people...
...who didn't sing nor prayed but wept in silence.
For weeks and months, flowers brought by everyone in Rome covered her grave.
Bernardo was freed the following Tuesday.
The Company of San Marcello, who had the privilege of freeing a prisoner...
...in occasion of the celebration of the Holy Cross, managed to grant him freedom upon the condition that he paid, during that year,
25.000 scudi coins to the Company of Santa Trinità in Ponte Sisto.
The seizure of the Cenci family's fortune was revoked eight years later, through the payment of
80.000 scudi coins.
Their properties were given back to Giacomo's children, with the exception of the huge Torre Nova estate which couldn't be returned...
...as it had been acquired by
Giovanni Francesco Aldobrandini, the pope's nephew.
Subtitled by Francesco Massaccesi
Where is she now?
It is her!
My son?
Can you deny that he looks like you?
And then, cinema became "talking"
Suddenly, on 29 October 1929...
... the New York Stock Market crashed
A real epidemic of suicides hits industrialists and entrepreneurs
The unprecedented devastating financial crisis...
... sweeps across United
States and the entire world.
In New York, in London and in Paris...
... the most fabulous fortunes vanish into thin air.
Large factories close and dismiss their staff
Within a few weeks, millions of unemployed...
Come to the table!

Look over there!
Come on! Let's go!

That's very good.
Let's pass on history now.
When did the battle of Waterloo take place?
I'm asking you when did the battle of Waterloo take place?
That's very good.
Leave the doggy in peace and behave yourself.
Who did succeed Napoleon?
The King.
- Who was the King?
- The King of Spades!
No, it wasn't the King of Spades.
It was Louis XVIII!
When did Louis XVIII die?
Oh! How Lovely!
What does it mean?
I don't know.
Peking duck
So, from one village to another and from one country to another...

Yoyo, the little saltimbanque...

Thank you very much.
You are very kind.
Isolina, come!
You may go.
Yet, during these years the world situation aggravates
The weapons are considerably evolving 
And everywhere, over the land, the sea and on the skies
... the Great Nations pursue at large the military reform.
The world is under threat.
The anguish takes the place of tranquillity.
The tension increases
Fever grips Europe
Day after day diplomatic relations deteriorate
Territorial claims become pressing and threatening
The most dangerous methods are applied
... in order to uncover the secret plans of the adversaries.
All the forms of espionage and subversive activities are developing
Everywhere, the ears of the enemy listen, mark down...
... and transmit to senior officers the most significant state top secrets.
Furthermore, the economic collapse and widespread discontent...
... bring about great changes in the governance
and the internal organisation of the Nations.
In addition, in Europe a furious wave of dictatorships rises
... that none can stop.
Everything indicates that the
Great Powers are regrouping themselves
The entire world prepares.
On 2 September 1942 the war breaks out.
Yoyo's there!
This is not possible!
- I'm very glad to see you.
- I'm glad too.
- How are you?
- Everything's fine?
I saw your parents in Kairo.
They're all right.
It's a great relief to know.
Yoyo came back!
You didn't change.
- You didn't lose weight.
- A little.
- What does he say?
- That you look like your father!
- Yoyo, are you not going to greet me?
- Esmeralda!
Isolina!
You are amazing!
Yoyo, what about your castle?
My castle needs much work.
That's for sure.
But I won't give it up!
Little by little, I'm going to repair it.
Yes, this is what you must do, repairing it little by little.
This is what I'm going to do!
- Would you like to smoke one?
- Thanks.
You know, the biggest problem...
...is the cost.
Money is all that matters.
- Camera?
- No, music!
Milk!
This is amazing!
I didn't recognize you!
- How are you?
- Fine thanks.
- Are you still doing trampoline?
- No, trapeze with my brothers.
- Really? That is fantastic.
- Are you still a clown?
Yes but everything has changed.
The music... the trumpet... the violin...
- Tell me.
- I will.
- Look here.
- What is this?
Comical ideas.
- Is that yours?
- Yes, thank you.
- What is this?
- A gang!
- How do you find the gangs?
- I watch closely the things around me.
- Are you going to stay for long?
- No, I'm leaving tomorrow.
I'll come with you.
I'd like that much...
...but I got lots of business.
Come in.
"My little dear, we received your telegram from Madrid"
"...as well as your card from London. "
"We are in Switzerland and we went quite well in Zurich. "
"Yesterday and the day before yesterday as well.
"We do enjoy a very good health..."
"...and now that winter is coming"
"...we are going to Italy."
"I hope that you are all right too..."
"...and that you always find good ideas"
"Leo saw your number in Vienna.."
"...and told us that it was splendid."
"Have you got any other plans?"
"We're much interested in what you are doing."
"You will soon start in Brussels. "
"Keep us update. Write to us as often as you can..."
 Me and your father kiss you dearly..."
"...I wish I could see you again very soon, my beloved little one.
"Kisses from your mother."
- Isolina, what are you doing here?
- I'm leaving, I finished.
I'm starting my new number in Berlin.
- You are getting quite well.
- I've no complain.
I'm doing well but...
... I spend all I earn for the castle.
Why are you keeping it?
Do you need money?
You are really very kind.
Bye-bye. My train is leaving in ten minutes.
Now, there comes the television
Due to this remarkable technological advance...
... we are every day and every hour the astonished witnesses of a miracle
Television can refine into perfection and virtually replace
... all the traditional forms of spectacle.
Within a few years it has been installed in every living room
And now it has become part of our daily life
It is in tune with the rhythm of our lives
This friend, this great friend...
... is an evolution..
... a revolution...
Believe me, the word is not strong enough...
... because television can sweep everything and anything.
We are not any more obliged to leave our homes...
... and go to distant halls...
You stay in the warmness and tranquillity
... of your nest.
All the world...
All the world with its dramas and its troubles
... and its joys too...
Yes, all the world is coming to you.
You don't need to go to any other spectacle
It is the spectacle itself that comes to your house.
Music?
Keep the change!
Cut.
- Are you satisfied?
- Absolutely yes.
Good night. It was faultless.
When you are ready, tell me.
No, sir is not here.
Who wants to speak with him?
Mr Luhmann is here.
Would you receive him?
Let him in.
Good afternoon. I will not detain you.
I'll show some things that might interest you.
Mr Claudel is here.
Just a minute.
Let him in.
I'll have an amazing suggestion for you. Got a minute?
Please, just one minute!
No! 600.000.
2x3!
Please, have a look here!
A circus? No sir.
A parking!
3.000 cars, three floors.
It is a sensational idea.
Are you totally nuts?
Get out!
May I ask for you permission?
The classical nose.
It is plastic, washable and of course luminous.
Very funny!
A moment please!
- The appointment with Mr. Rivierre
- Let him in.
The idea for the poster, sir.
Have you got any paper?
You see? Make something like that.
This is something new.
It's American as you can see.
It is very soft and funny.
One moment, please.
No, I'm not here.
Who's there? Come in.
Don't let anyone to disturb us.
I wanted to show you...
- Did you find a gang?
- No, nothing.
Go, my friend.
Don't let anyone to disturb me.
The new nylon wig.
We can comb it, wash it,..
In a spring of water of course!
Just one moment, please!
It is so good! It has a 6-liter reservoir!
200.000 dollars?
That's enough!
No, it's not enough!
250.000 dollars!
- Look at what you have done?
- Did you know about this?
It's new.
Hit me on the head!
Hit!
It's not only that!
Have a look there!
It is good, isn't it?
- Water?
- Yes, water!
It's out of order when we need it!
There are also all these taxes!
I was saying to Liliane...
He started from nothing!
I saw you on TV with the violin.
I laughed myself to death.
It was completely ridiculous.
Oh, tell me. How did you invent your character?
Excuse me.
How much did the renovation of your castle cost?
One moment, please.
The press! Always the press!
- Do you remember me from Beirut?
- No!
I'm Madame de Brouillac.
I have to tell you something important.
Come! From here!
Attention to the two steps.
Come! Please!
Thank you.
Are you going to make some funny thing?
This is fantastic!
I'm going to tell you something funny.
Only funny things happen to me.
Yesterday, in the street...
My necklace!
Joseph, I'm thirsty!
- ¡ coca-cola or 
- A champagne!
I didn't believe that thing could happen to me.
Do you know what happened to me?
Your parents are here.
Go welcome them.
This is marvellous! Please come inside!
- Tell them to come in.
- Let them be.
Come on, please.
Everything is ready.
Please I ask you to come.
Why not? Why?
Come, I implore you!
Every second bastard born is fathered by a priest.
But in Utopia that couldn't be.
For why?
- For there the priests are very holy.
- Therefore very few.
Is it anything interesting, Matthew?
- Bless you, sir. I don't know.
- Bless you too, Matthew.
To be sure, we have some holy priests in England.
- Oh, name some.
- Brother James.
Man's a simpleton.
It's from Cardinal Wolsey.
What's he want?
- Me.
- When?
Now.
In Hampton Court?
You won't be there by midnight.
- The King's business.
- Queen's business.
Mistress Anne Boleyn's business.
Well, it's all the Cardinal's business.
That's very true. And when the Cardinal calls, you all come running, day or night.
What is the man? A butcher's son.
Chancellor of England, too.
No, that's his office. What's the man?
Surely, Your Grace, when a man rises so high and so swiftly... we must think he was misplaced in his origins.
That, at least, was the opinion of Aristotle and...
A butcher's son and looks it.
His looks, yes, I give you his looks.
What was that you said, Richard?
Nothing, Sir Thomas, it was out of place.
And Wolsey's still a butcher.
And you're a member of the King's
High Council, not an errand boy.
That is why I must go.
The Duke would go if the Cardinal called him.
I might.
I'll be back for breakfast.
Go to bed.
"Dear Lord, give us rest tonight, or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.
"Careful only for our soul's salvation.
For Christ's sake. Amen."
And bless our lord, the King.
- "And bless our lord, the King."
- Amen!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodnight, Your Grace.
Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.
He's a frightened man.
- Who is that?
- A young friend from Cambridge.
- What's he want?
- What do they all want? A position.
- Can you give him a position?
- Do you recommend him?
No.
- Sir Thomas.
- No.
- Did you recommend me?
- No.
Richard, I may have a position for you.
- What? What position?
- Not now, Richard. Tomorrow.
For you all, boatman.
Thank you, sir.
Sir Thomas is here, Your Grace.
Sir Thomas.
Master Cromwell.
You opposed me in the Council this morning, Thomas.
Yes, Your Grace.
- You were the only one.
- Yes, Your Grace.
You're a fool.
Thank God there is only one fool on the Council.
Why did you oppose me?
I thought Your Grace was wrong.
A matter of conscience.
You're a constant regret to me, Thomas.
If you could just see facts flat on... without that horrible moral squint.
With a little common sense, you could have made a statesman.
The King.
Where's he been? Do you know?
I, Your Grace?
Spare me your discretion.
He's been to play in the muck again.
He's been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.
More, are you going to help me?
If Your Grace will be specific.
You're a plodder! All right, we'll plod.
The King wants a son.
What are you going to do about it?
I'm very sure the King needs no advice from me on what to do about it.
Thomas, we're alone.
I give you my word, there's no one here.
I didn't suppose there was, Your Grace.
Do you favor a change of dynasty?
Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?
For God's sake, Your Grace!
Then he needs a son. I repeat, what are you going to do about it?
I pray for it daily.
God's death, he means it.
That thing out there, at least she's fertile.
- But she's not his wife.
- No, Catherine's his wife... and she's barren as a brick.
Are you going to pray for a miracle?
There are precedents.
All right. Good. Pray by all means.
But in addition to prayer there is effort.
And my effort is to secure a divorce.
Have I your support, or have I not?
The Pope gave a dispensation, so that the King might marry... his brother's widow for state reasons.
We are to ask the Pope to dispense with his dispensation, also for state reasons?
I don't like plodding, Thomas. Well?
Then, clearly all we have to do is to approach His Holiness and ask him.
I think we might influence the decision of His Holiness.
By argument?
Argument certainly. And pressure.
Pressure, applied to the Church?
The Church has its church property.
Pressure.
No, Your Grace,
I'm not going to help you.
Then goodnight, Master More.
Let the dynasty die with Henry VIII and we'll have dynastic wars again.
Blood-witted barons ramping the country from end to end.
Is that what you want? Very well.
England needs an heir.
Certain measures, perhaps regrettable... perhaps not, there's much in the Church which needs reformation, Thomas.
All right, regrettable.
But necessary to get us an heir.
Now, explain how you, as a councilor of England, can obstruct these measures... for the sake of your own private conscience.
I think that when statesmen forsake their own private conscience... for the sake of their public duties... they lead their country by a short route to chaos.
And we shall have my prayers to fall back on.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
To govern the country with prayers?
Yes, I should.
I'd like to be there when you try.
Who will wear this after me?
Who's our next chancellor?
You? Fisher? Suffolk?
- Fisher for me.
- Aye, but for the King?
What about my secretary,
Master Cromwell?
Cromwell. He's a very able man.
But?
Me rather than Cromwell.
Then, come down to earth.
Until you do... you and I are enemies.
As Your Grace wishes.
As God wills.
Perhaps, Your Grace.
More! You should have been a cleric!
Like yourself, Your Grace?
Goodnight, Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas.
- What's this?
- From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.
- Leicester?
- You do more good than you know, sir.
My daughter has a case, sir, in the Court of Poor Man's Causes.
Baked apples, sir.
To sweeten my judgment.
I'll give your daughter the same judgment
I would give my own.
A fair one, quickly.
Bless you, sir.
I understand. Yes. I'll read it.
Yes. Thank you.
Good evening, Sir Thomas.
- I'll read it.
- It's an awkward case.
- I could illuminate it for you...
- I'll read it.
Just a moment or two...
Boat!
Sir?
Chelsea, sir?
Chelsea.
I expect you'll make it worth my while, sir.
- You've got a license?
- Bless you, yes sir, I've got a license.
- Well then, the fares are fixed.
- They are, sir.
Hampton to Chelsea downstream, a penny halfpenny.
Chelsea to Hampton upstream, a penny halfpenny.
Whoever makes the regulations doesn't row a boat.
No. Three pence if you get me home for breakfast.
Thank you, sir.
A nice cup, sir.
Yes.
That's worth money, sir.
Mind a way, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- Have you been here all night?
- Yes.
You said there was a post?
Yes. I'll offer you a post, with a house, a servant and £50 a year.
What post?
At the new school.
A teacher!
Richard, no one's going to give you a place at court.
Master Cromwell says he'll do something for me.
Cromwell?
Well, if you know Cromwell you don't need my help.
Sir Thomas?
If only you knew how much, much rather, I had your help than his.
Not to a place at court.
Why not?
Look.
- What is it?
- It's a bribe!
"I am the gift of Averil Machin."
And Averil Machin has a lawsuit in the Court of Requests.
Italian silver. Take it. No joke.
Thank you.
What will you do with it?
Sell it.
- And buy what?
- A decent gown!
But Richard, that's a little bribe.
At court they offer you all sorts of things, home, manor houses, coats of arms.
A man should go where he won't be tempted.
Why not be a teacher? You'd be a fine teacher. Perhaps a great one.
- If I was, who would know it?
- You! Your pupils. Your friends.
God. Not a bad public, that.
And a quiet life.
You say that.
You come from talking with the Cardinal.
Yes, talking with the Cardinal.
It's eating your heart out, isn't it?
The high affairs of state.
The divorce?
Boatman!
Sir?
- Take this gentleman to the New Inn!
- Right, sir.
Sir Thomas?
Thank you.
Be a teacher.
- Matthew.
- Sir.
- Lady Alice in bed?
- Yes, sir.
- Lady Margaret?
- No, sir.
The Master Roper's here, sir.
At this hour? Who let him in?
He's a hard man to keep out, sir.
Will wants to marry me, Father.
Well, he can't marry you.
Sir Thomas, I'm called to the Bar.
Oh, congratulations, Roper.
My family may not be at the palace, but in the city...
There's nothing wrong with your family, Will.
There's not much wrong with you.
Except you seem to need a clock.
I can buy a clock, sir.
Roper, the answer is no... and will be no as long as you're a heretic.
Now, that's a word I don't like,
Sir Thomas!
It's not a likeable word or thing.
The Church is heretical!
Dr. Luther's proved that to my satisfaction!
Luther is an excommunicate!
From a heretic Church!
Church? It's a shop!
- Salvation by the shilling! And divorces!
- Will, no!
- What I know, I'll say!
- You've no sense of the place!
He's no sense of the time.
Now listen well.
Two years ago you were a passionate churchman.
Now you're a passionate Lutheran.
We must just pray that when your head's finished turning... your face is to the front again.
- Is your horse here?
- No, sir, I walked.
Well, take a horse from the stables and get back home.
Go along.
May I come again?
Yes. Soon.
Is that final, Father?
As long as he's a heretic, Meg, that's absolute.
What did Wolsey want?
Nice boy, young Will.
Terribly strong principles, though.
Clumsy, too.
- You're very pensive.
- You're very gay.
Was it the divorce?
To bed.
They're a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.
Always swimming against the stream.
Old Roper was just the same...
You don't want to talk about it.
No.
- I'm sorry you were awakened, chick.
- I wasn't sleeping very deeply.
What did Wolsey want?
- Will Roper's been.
- Will Roper?
Yes, he's been here all night.
He wants to marry Meg.
- Why you don't beat that girl I...
- No.
She's full of education and it's a delicate commodity.
Goodnight, Meg.
Goodnight.
Marry Meg. A lawyer's son.
Well, she's a lawyer's daughter.
Norfolk spoke of you for Chancellor of England before he left.
Well, he's a dangerous friend then.
Wolsey's chancellor, God help him.
But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you...
If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp a few small boats like ours.
No.
There'll be no new chancellors while Wolsey lives.
The Duke of Norfolk,
Earl Marshal of England.
Have you any message for His Majesty?
If I had served God... one half so well as I've served my King...
God would not have left me here, to die in this place.
Thank God you're dying here.
The King would have you die in the Tower.
"I am straightly charged by the King himself...
"here openly to declare how much all England...
"is beholden to this man.
"And how worthy he is to have the highest room in the realm.
"And how dearly the King's grace doth love and trust him...
"not only for much good council...
"deliberate council, but for better council yet...
"that which is privy to the King's person.
"This same Sir Thomas More...
"here made before you all to be...
"Lord Chancellor of the Realm."
Calm yourself, Matthew.
Fetch Lady Alice.
That's very well.
My lady! The King!
Now remember, the visit's a surprise.
But he'll know we're expecting him...
It's a very great honor.
One friend calling on another.
What's he really coming for?
To talk about the divorce.
He wants an answer.
- But he's had his answer.
- He wants another.
Thomas!
Your Majesty does my house more honor than I fear my household will bear.
No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!
A passing fancy.
I happened to be on the river.
Look. Mud.
By heaven, what an evening.
Lady Alice,
I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.
Yes, Your Grace. Well, no, Your Grace.
Well, that is, we are ready to entertain...
This is my daughter Margaret, sire.
She's not yet had the honor to meet Your Grace.
Why Margaret, they told me you were a scholar.
Answer, Margaret.
Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.
Can you dance, too?
Not well, Your Grace.
Well, I dance superlatively!
That's a dancer's leg, Margaret!
Lady Alice, the river's given me an appetite.
If Your Grace would share a very simple supper.
It would please me. Lead them in.
Thomas and I will follow.
Matthew.
My lords and gentlemen!
Margaret?
Your Grace?
Do you like music?
Yes, Your Grace.
They'll play to you.
Now, listen to this.
Sit down.
Be seated. No courtship, Thomas.
You're my friend, are you not?
Your Majesty.
Thank God I have a friend for my chancellor.
Readier to befriend, I trust, than he was to be chancellor.
My own knowledge of my poor abilities...
I will judge of your abilities.
Thomas?
You know that Wolsey named you for chancellor?
Before he died, Wolsey named you, and Wolsey was no fool.
He was a statesman of incomparable ability, Your Grace.
Was he?
Was he so?
Then, why did he fail me?
It was villainy then.
Yes, villainy.
Secret opposition, secret.
But deliberate, willful, meditated opposition.
Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.
What is it? Thought!
Because I'm simple and plain and deal with every man straightforwardly.
Because of that I say, do they take me for a simpleton?
Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.
Pride right through.
And he failed me.
Failed me in the one thing that matters, then as now.
But look.
Be seated.
What an evening.
A man could fight a lion.
Some men could, Your Grace.
Thomas... touching this matter of my divorce.
Have you thought of it since we last spoke?
Of little else.
Then you see your way clear to me?
That you should put away
Queen Catherine, sire?
Alas, as I think of it,
I see so clearly... that I cannot come with Your Grace, that my endeavor is... not to think of it at all.
Then you haven't thought enough!
Lilac.
We have them at Hampton.
Not so fine as this, though.
I'm in an excellent frame of mind.
Thomas, you must consider,
I stand in peril of my soul.
It was no marriage.
I have lived in incest with my brother's widow.
Leviticus: "Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife."
Leviticus. Chapter 18, verse 16.
Yes, Your Grace. But Deuteronomy...
Deuteronomy is ambiguous!
Your Grace, I'm not fitted to meddle in these matters.
To me, it seems a matter for the Holy See...
Thomas, does a man need a pope to tell him where he's sinned?
It was a sin.
God's punished me.
I've no son.
Son after son she's borne me.
All dead at birth, or dead within the month.
I never saw the hand of God so clear in anything.
It's my bounden duty to put away the Queen.
And all the popes, back to Peter, shall not come between me and my duty!
How is it that you cannot see?
Everyone else does.
Then, why does Your Grace need my poor support?
Because you're honest.
And what is more to the purpose, you're known to be honest.
Those like Norfolk follow me because I wear the crown.
Those like Cromwell follow because they're jackals with sharp teeth... and I'm their tiger.
A mass follows me... because it follows anything that moves.
And then there's you.
I am sick to think how much I must displease Your Grace.
No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.
But respect... man, that's water in the desert.
How'd you like our music?
That air they played, it had a certain...
Well, tell me what you thought of it.
Could it have been Your Grace's own?
Discovered!
Now I'll never know your true opinion, and that's irksome.
Well, we artists, we love praise, yet we love truth better.
- Then I will tell my true opinion.
- Well?
To me it seemed delightful.
Thomas, I chose the right man for chancellor.
I should in fairness add that my taste in music is reputedly deplorable.
Your taste in music is excellent!
It exactly coincides with my own.
Music.
Music.
Send them back without me, Thomas.
I'll live here in Chelsea and make music.
My house is at Your Grace's disposal.
Touching this other business, mark you...
I'll have no opposition.
Your Grace.
No opposition, I say. No opposition.
Be seated.
I'll leave you out of it but you are my chancellor.
I don't take it kindly and I'll have no opposition!
I see how it will be.
The bishops will oppose me!
The full-fed princes of the Church!
Hypocrites! All hypocrites!
Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!
Your Grace is unjust.
If I cannot serve Your Grace in this great matter of the Queen.
I have no queen!
Catherine's not my wife!
No priest can make her so.
They that say she is my wife are not only liars, but traitors!
Yes, traitors!
That I will not brook now!
Treachery!
I will not brook.
It maddens me!
It is a deadly canker in the body politic, and I will have it out!
See?
You see how you've maddened me?
I hardly know myself.
If you could come with me, there's no man I'd sooner raise... yes, with my own hand.
Your Grace overwhelms me.
What's that?
Eight o'clock, Your Grace.
Lift yourself up, man.
Have I not promised
I'll leave you out of it?
Shall we eat?
If Your Grace pleases.
Eight o'clock, you said.
The tide will be turning.
- I was forgetting the tide. I must go.
- I'm sorry, Your Grace.
If I don't catch the tide
I'll not get back to Richmond.
No, don't come.
Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.
Affairs call me to court.
So we give you our thanks and we say goodnight!
What's this?
- You crossed him!
- Somewhat.
- Why?
- I couldn't find the other way.
You're too nice altogether, Thomas.
- Woman, mind your house!
- I am minding my house!
God save Your Majesty!
God save Your Grace!
God save the King!
Lift!
Drop blades!
Sire! Sire! Sire!
Are you coming my way, Rich?
No.
I think you should, you know.
I can't tell you anything.
Well?
Thomas?
Stay friends with him.
Whatever may be done by smiling, you may rely on me to do.
Set your mind at rest.
This is not the stuff of which martyrs are made.
Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.
Will wants to talk to you, Father.
I told him it wouldn't be convenient.
You were quite right.
You're very free with my daughter's hand, Roper.
Yes.
It's of that I wish to speak.
Sir, you've had a disagreement with His Majesty.
- Have I?
- So Meg tells me.
I offer my congratulations.
If it's true, is it a matter for congratulation?
Yes!
Sir, when last I asked you for your daughter's hand... you objected to my unorthodox opinions.
- I did.
- Yes.
Well, since then my views have somewhat modified.
Well, that's good hearing, Will.
Mind you, I modify nothing concerning the various corruptions in the Church.
- Quite right.
- But an attack upon the Church herself... no. I see behind that an attack on God.
- Roper!
- The Devil's work... to be done by the Devil's ministers!
For heaven's sake, remember my office.
If you stand on your office...
No, I don't stand on it, but there are certain things I may not hear.
Sir Thomas.
Richard?
I fell.
Lady Alice.
- Lady Margaret.
- Good evening.
Do you know William Roper, the younger?
By reputation, of course.
- Good evening, Master...
- Rich.
You've heard of me?
Yes.
In what connection?
I don't know what you can have heard.
I sense that I'm not welcome here.
Why Richard? Have you done something to make you not welcome?
Cromwell is asking questions.
About you. He's always asking questions about you and your opinions.
Of whom?
Of him, for one.
That's one of his sources.
Of course. That's one of my servants.
All right, Matthew.
Well, you look at me as though I were an enemy.
Why Richard, you're shaking.
Help me.
How?
Employ me.
No.
- Employ me!
- No.
I would be faithful.
You couldn't answer for yourself even so far as tonight.
Arrest him!
- For what?
- He's dangerous!
- Libel. He's a spy!
- That man's bad!
- There's no law against that.
- God's law!
- Then God can arrest him.
- While you talk, he's gone!
Go he should, if he were the Devil, until he broke the law.
- Now you give the Devil benefit of law!
- Yes, what would you do?
Cut a road through the law to get after the Devil?
Yes. I'd cut down every law in England to do that.
And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned on you... where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?
This country is planted with laws from coast to coast...
Man's laws, not God's, and if you cut them down... and you're just the man to do it... do you really think you could stand upright in the wind that would blow then?
Yes.
I give the Devil benefit of law for my own safety's sake.
- Master Rich?
- Yes.
In there, sir.
Rich? Come in.
Taken you long enough to get here.
Have I kept you waiting?
Months.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Do you know the news?
- What news?
- Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.
And I succeed him.
Secretary to the Council?
You?
'Tis surprising, isn't it?
I mean, one sees that's logical.
Sit down, Rich.
No ceremony, no courtship... as His Majesty would say.
You see how I trust you.
I'd never repeat or report a thing like that.
What kind of thing would you repeat or report?
Nothing said in friendship.
Do you believe that?
- Why, yes.
- No, seriously.
Well, yes.
Rich, seriously.
That would depend what I was offered.
Don't say it just to please me.
It's true. It would depend what I was offered.
Well, there is another post vacant.
Collector of Revenues for York.
Is it in your gift?
Effectively.
What must I do for it?
I know a man who wants to change his woman.
Normally a matter of small importance, but in this case... it's our liege, Lord Henry, the eighth of that name.
Which is a quaint way of saying that if he wants to change his woman, he will.
And our job as administrators... is to minimize the inconvenience which this is going to cause.
That's our only job, Rich, to minimize the inconvenience of things.
A harmless occupation you would say, but no.
We administrators are not liked, Rich.
We are not popular.
I say "we" on the assumption you'll accept the post at York I've offered you.
Yes.
It's a bad sign when people are depressed by their own good fortune.
- I'm not depressed.
- You look depressed.
I was lamenting. I've lost my innocence.
Some time ago.
Have you only just noticed?
Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor, now there's an innocent man.
The odd thing is, he is.
Yes, I say he is. Unhappily... his innocence is tangled up in this problem... that you can't change your woman without a divorce... and you can't get a divorce unless the Pope says so.
And from this meaningless circumstance,
I foresee a certain measure of...
- Inconvenience?
- Just so.
This goblet he gave you, how much was it worth?
Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.
How much did you get for it?
Fifty shillings.
It was a gift, wasn't it, from a litigant, a woman?
- Yes.
- Which court? Chancery?
Don't get drunk!
Which court was the litigant's case?
Court of Requests.
There. That wasn't too painful, was it?
- No.
- No.
And you'll find it easier, next time.
My Lord Archbishop, my lords...
Reverend Doctors of the Church.
The answer of our liege, Lord Henry... to his trusty well-beloved subjects... pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.
"His Majesty...
"acknowledges your humble admission of many grievous errors...
"for which he accepts...
"the manumission of £100,000 in token.
"Mindful for the well-being of the realm and the quietness of his subjects...
"His Majesty requires that you do now straightly renounce your pretended...
"allegiance to the See of Rome.
"And admit the statute passed through parliament...
"acknowledging the King's good title...
"Supreme Head of the Church in England."
Well, my lords, what's your answer?
Yea or nay?
His Majesty accepts your resignation very sadly.
He's mindful of your goodness and past loyalty.
And in any matter concerning your honor and welfare he'll continue your good lord.
You will convey my humble gratitude.
- Help me with this.
- Not I.
- Alice?
- No.
Sun and moon, Master More, you're taken for a wise man. Is this wisdom?
To betray your ability... abandon your station and forget your duty to your kith and kin?
Shall I, sir?
No, thank you, son Roper.
Margaret... will you?
Yes.
If you want.
There's my clever girl.
Well done, sir! In my opinion, that thing's a degradation.
I'll tell you my opinion of the King's title, too...
Don't! Will, silence!
Remember, you have a wife now... and may have children.
All right, Thomas, make me understand... because I tell you, to me this looks like cowardice!
All right, I will.
This isn't reformation, this is war against the Church.
Our King has declared war on the Pope because the Pope will not declare...
- ... that our Queen is not his wife.
- And is she?
Is she?
Have I your word that what we say here is between us two?
Very well.
And if the King should command you to repeat what I may say?
I should keep my word to you.
Then what has become of your oath of obedience to the King?
You lay traps for me!
No, I show you the times.
We are at war with the Pope.
For the Pope's a prince, isn't he?
He is. He's also the descendant of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.
So you believe.
And will you forfeit all you have... which includes the respect of your country, for a belief?
Because what matters is that I believe it, or rather, no... not that I believe it, but that I believe it.
- I trust I make myself obscure?
- Perfectly.
Why do you insult me with this lawyer's chatter?
Because I'm afraid.
Man, you're ill.
This isn't Spain, you know.
This is England.
My friends, you all know why I've called you here.
I have today resigned my office.
I am no longer a great man.
Sir, we want you to know that we're all on your side.
My side? What side is that?
Well, sir, we all know what you think.
None of you knows what I think.
And if you guess... and babble it about, you do me no good service.
Since I am no more a great man,
I no longer need a great household.
Nor can I afford one.
You will have to go.
However, I still number some great men among my friends... and they still need great households.
No one will be turned away until we've found another place for him.
- We can't find places for them all.
- Yes, we can.
Thank you.
That is all.
What about you, Matthew?
Will you stay?
Well, sir, that's according.
There will be more work and less money.
Well then, I don't see how I can then, sir.
After all, I've got my own...
Quite right, Matthew. Why should you?
I shall miss you, Matthew.
Oh, no, sir, you see through me, sir.
I know that.
I shall miss you.
Damn me! Isn't that them all over!
Miss me? What's in me for him to miss?
"Matthew, will you take a cut in wages?"
No, Sir Thomas, I will not.
And that's it. And that's all of it! All right, so he's down on his luck, I'm sorry.
I don't mind saying that I'm sorry, bad luck.
If I had good luck to spare he could have some!
I wish we could have good luck all the time.
I wish rainwater was beer!
I wish we had wings! But we don't.
Well, there's an end of you.
What'll you do now? Sit by the fire... and make goslings in the ash?
Not at all, Alice.
I expect I'll write a bit...
I'll write...
I'll read, I'll think.
I think I'll learn to fish.
I'll play with my grandchildren when son Roper's done his duty.
- Alice, shall I teach you to read?
- No, by God!
Poor, silly man, you think they'll leave you here to think?
If we govern our tongues, they will!
I have a word to say on that. I've made no statement. I've resigned, that's all.
The King is made, by act of parliament,
Supreme Head of the Church in England.
This English Church will divorce him from the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.
But on any of these matters, have you heard me make a statement?
No.
If I'm to lose my rank and fall to housekeeping, I want to know the reason.
- So make a statement now.
- No.
Alice, it's a point of law.
Accept it from me... that in silence is my safety, under the law.
And my silence must be absolute, it must extend to you.
In short, you don't trust me.
I'm the Lord Chief Justice,
I'm Cromwell, I'm the keeper of the Tower.
I take your hand...
I clamp it on the Bible, on the blessed Cross and I say:
"Woman, has your husband made a statement on these matters?
"On peril of your soul remember, what is your answer?"
No.
And so it must remain.
Have you opened your mind to Meg?
Would I tell Meg what I won't tell you?
Meg has your heart.
I know that well enough.
This is a dangerous matter then... if you've not told Meg.
I don't think so. No.
When they find I'm silent... they'll want nothing better than to leave me silent.
You'll see.
But he's silent, Master Secretary, why not leave him silent?
Your Grace, not being a man of letters... you perhaps don't realize the extent of his reputation.
This silence of his is bellowing up and down Europe!
In Europe he is claimed as the King's enemy.
Rubbish! Crank he may be, traitor he is not.
Exactly. And with a little pressure...
With a little pressure he can be got to say so.
That's all we need.
A brief declaration of his loyalty...
- ... to the present administration.
- I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.
The King does not agree with you.
What kind of pressure do you think you can bring to bear?
I have evidence that Sir Thomas, while he was a judge, accepted bribes.
What?
Goddammit! He was the only judge since Cato who didn't accept bribes!
When was there a chancellor whose possessions, after three years... totaled £100 and a gold chain?
It is, as you imply, common practice... but a practice may be common and remain an offence.
This offence could send a man to the Tower.
Come here.
This woman's name is Averil Machin.
She comes from Leicester.
- She entered a case...
- A property case it was.
Shut your mouth.
A property case in the Court of Requests in April, 1528.
And got a wicked false judgment!
And got an impeccably correct judgment from Sir Thomas.
- No, sir, it was not!
- Tell the gentleman... about the gift you gave the judge.
I gave him a cup, sir.
A silver Italian cup I bought in Leicester, for 100 shillings.
Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?
Yes, sir, he did.
He did accept it. We can corroborate that.
You can go.
- To my way of thinking...
- Go!
- Is that your witness?
- No.
By an odd coincidence that cup later came into the hands of Master Rich here.
How?
- He gave it to me, Your Grace.
- Gave it to you? Why?
A gift.
Yes, you were a friend, weren't you?
When did Thomas give you this thing?
I can't exactly remember.
Do you "remember" what you did with it?
- I sold it.
- Where?
- A shop.
- Has the shop still got it?
No. They've lost all track of it.
How convenient.
You doubt Master Rich's word,
Your Grace?
It had occurred to me.
This is the bill of sale.
That cow put her case into court in April, you said. This is dated May.
In other words, the moment Thomas knew the cup was a bribe... he dropped it into the nearest gutter.
The facts will bear that interpretation,
I suppose.
This is a horse that won't run,
Master Secretary.
Just a trial gallop.
We'll find something better.
- I want no part of it.
- You have no choice.
What's that you say?
The King particularly wishes you to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.
He's not told me that.
Indeed? He told me.
Look here, Cromwell... what's the purpose of all this?
There you have me.
It's a matter of conscience, I think.
The King wants Sir Thomas to bless his marriage.
If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.
He won't attend the wedding.
If I were you, I'd try and persuade him.
I really would try, if I were you.
Cromwell, are you threatening me?
My dear Norfolk, this isn't Spain.
This is England!
Thomas? Thomas!
Lady Margaret?
Yes.
We've been cutting greens.
We use them for fuel.
I have a letter for your father,
Lady Margaret. From Hampton Court.
He's to answer certain charges before Secretary Cromwell.
Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.
Master Rich will make a record of our conversation.
Good of you to tell me,
Master Secretary.
I think you know one another.
Indeed yes, we're old friends.
That's a nice gown you have, Richard.
Sir Thomas, believe me.
No, that's asking too much.
But let me tell you all the same.
You have no more sincere admirer than myself.
No, not yet, Rich, not yet.
If I might hear the charges.
- The charges?
- I understand there are certain charges.
Some ambiguities of behavior
I should like to clarify, hardly charges.
Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?
There are no charges.
Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas.
The King is not pleased with you.
I am grieved.
And yet, do you know that even now, if you could bring yourself... to agree with the Church, universities, the Lords and the Commons... there is no honor which His Majesty would be likely to deny you?
I am well acquainted with
His Grace's generosity.
Very well.
You have heard of the so-called
"Holy Maid of Kent"... who was executed for prophesying against the King?
- Yes, I met her.
- Yes, you met her.
Yet you did not warn His Majesty of her treason. How was that?
She spoke no treason.
Our talk was not political.
But the woman was notorious.
Do you expect me to believe that?
- Happily, there were witnesses.
- You wrote a letter to her.
Yes. I wrote, advising her to abstain from meddling in the affairs of state.
I have a copy of the letter.
Also witnessed.
- You have been cautious.
- I like to keep my affairs regular.
In the June of 1521, the King published a book.
A theological work.
It was called,
A Defense of the Seven Sacraments.
For which he was named "Defender of the Faith" by His Holiness, the Pope.
By the Bishop of Rome, or do you insist on "pope"?
No. "Bishop of Rome" if you like.
It doesn't alter his authority.
Thank you. You come to the point very readily. What is that authority?
For example, in the Church of England... what exactly is the Bishop of Rome's authority?
You will find it very ably set out and defended, Master Secretary... in the King's book.
In the book published under the King's name, would be more accurate.
- You wrote this book.
- I wrote no part of it.
I don't mean you actually held the pen.
I answered to my best ability, some points of common law... which the King put to me, as I was bound to do.
Do you deny you instigated it?
It was from first to last the King's own project.
The King says not.
The King knows the truth of it.
And whatever he may have said to you... he will not give evidence to support this accusation.
Why not?
Because evidence is given on oath, and he will not perjure himself.
If you don't know that, then you don't yet know him.
Sir Thomas More.
Have you anything to say... regarding the King's marriage with Queen Anne?
I understood
I was not to be asked that again.
Then you understood wrongly.
These charges...
They are terrors for children,
Master Secretary, not for me!
Then know that the King commands me to charge you... in his name, with great ingratitude!
And to tell you that there never was, nor could be, so villainous a servant... nor so traitorous a subject, as yourself!
So...
I am brought here at last.
Brought?
You've brought yourself to where you stand now.
You may go.
For the present.
What will you do now?
Whatever's necessary.
Boat!
Oh, come, come, it's not as bad as all that!
Howard!
I can't get home.
They won't bring me a boat.
Do you blame them?
Is it as bad as that?
It's every bit as bad as that!
Then it's good of you to be seen with me.
I followed you.
Were you followed?
- You're dangerous to know!
- Then don't know me.
- I do know you.
- I mean as a friend.
- I am your friend. I wish I wasn't, but I am.
- What's to be done then?
- Give in.
- I can't give in, Howard.
Our friendship's more mutable than that.
The one fixed point in the world of turning friendship...
- ... is that Sir More won't give in.
- To me it has to be, for that's myself.
Affection goes as deep in me as you, I think.
But only God is love right through,
Howard, and that's my self.
And who are you?
A lawyer! And a lawyer's son!
We're supposed to be the proud ones, the arrogant ones, we've all given in.
Why must you stand out?
Goddammit man! It's disproportionate!
You'll break my heart.
No one is safe, Howard, and you have a son.
We'll end our friendship now.
- For friendship's sake?
- Yes.
Daft!
Norfolk, you're a fool!
You can't place a quarrel, you haven't the style.
Hear me out. You and your class have given in, as you rightly call it...
'cause this country's religion means nothing to you at all.
Well, that's a foolish saying for a start!
The nobility of England...
The nobility of England would have snored through the Sermon on the Mount!
But you'll labor like scholars over a bulldog's pedigree.
An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.
We've had a quarrel since the day we met.
Our friendship was mere sloth.
You can be cruel when you want, but I've always known that.
What do you value in your bulldogs?
Gripping, is it not?
- Yes.
- It's their nature?
- Yes.
- It's why you breed them?
It's so with men.
I will not give in, because I oppose it.
Not my pride, not my spleen, nor any other of my appetites, but I do, I.
Is there, in the midst of all this muscle, no sinew that serves no appetite... of Norfolk's, but is just Norfolk?
There is!
- Give that some exercise, my lord!
- Thomas!
As you stand you'll go before your Maker ill conditioned!
Now steady.
And he'll think that, somewhere back along your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!
Cast in this very house on April 3, last year... it is a matter very fit for the Commons, gathered here... in parliament, to take in hand.
Or, in consequence of the decay of guilds... the woolen cloth, now coming out of Yorkshire, Lincoln... and the like, is not to blame and this...
I will defer the rest of my matter to later.
That the loyal Commons, here assembled, will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.
For as much as it concerns the King's new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.
Both matters pleasing to a loyal subject.
Mark, my Masters... there is among us a brood of discreet traitors... to which deceit the King can brook no longer.
And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now drive these subtle foxes from their covert.
Father?
Margaret!
I couldn't get a boat.
What is it, Meg?
Father, there's a new act going through parliament.
And by this act, they're going to administer an oath... about the marriage.
On what compulsion is the oath?
- High treason.
- But what is the wording?
Do the words matter?
We know what it means.
Tell me the words.
An oath is made of words.
It may be possible to take it.
Take it?
And if it can be taken, you must take it, too.
No!
Listen, Meg. God made the angels to show him splendor.
As he made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity.
But Man he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind.
If he suffers us to come to such a case that there is no escaping... then we may stand to our tackle as best we can.
And yes, Meg, then we can clamor like champions, if we have the spittle for it.
But it's God's part, not our own, to bring ourselves to such a pass.
Our natural business lies in escaping.
If I can take this oath, I will.
I would, for my sake, you could take the oath.
I never took a man into the Tower less willingly.
Thank you, Master Governor.
Thank you.
Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas.
Sir Thomas!
This is iniquitous.
- Where to this time?
- Richmond Palace.
Sit down.
This is the Seventh Commission to inquire into the case... of Sir Thomas More, appointed by His Majesty's Council.
Have you anything to say?
No.
- Seen this document before?
- Many times.
It is the Act of Succession.
These are the names of those who have sworn to it.
- I have, as you say, seen it before.
- Will you swear to it?
No.
Thomas, we must know...
We must know plainly whether you recognize the offspring of Queen Anne... as heirs to the throne.
The King in parliament tells me that they are.
- Of course I recognize them.
- Will you swear to it?
- Yes.
- Then why won't he swear to the act?
Because there is more than that in the act.
Just so. Sir Thomas, it states in the preamble that the King's former marriage... to the Lady Catherine was unlawful... she being his brother's widow and the Pope having no authority to sanction it.
Is that what you deny?
Is that what you dispute?
Is that what you are not sure of?
You insult His Majesty and Council in the person of the Lord Archbishop!
I insult no one.
I will not take the oath.
I will not tell you why I will not.
- Then your reasons must be treasonable!
- Not "must be," may be.
It's a fair assumption!
The law requires more than an assumption, the law requires a fact.
Of course, I cannot judge your legal standing in the case... but until I know the ground of your objections...
I can only guess your spiritual standing, too.
If you're willing to guess that, it should be small matter to guess my objections.
Then you do have objections to the act?
Well, we know that, Cromwell!
No, my lord, you don't.
You may suppose I have objections, all you know is that I will not swear to it... for which you cannot lawfully harm me further.
But if you were right in supposing me to have objections, and right again... in supposing my objections to be treasonable... the law would let you cut my head off.
Oh, yes.
Well done, Sir Thomas.
I've been trying to make that clear to His Grace for some time.
Oh, confound all this!
I'm not a scholar.
I don't know if the marriage was lawful or not... but damn it, Thomas, look at these names.
Why can't you do as I did, and come with us, for fellowship?
And when we die, and you are sent to heaven for doing your conscience... and I am sent to hell for not doing mine, will you come with me, for fellowship?
So, those of us whose names are there, are damned, Sir Thomas?
I have no window to look into another man's conscience.
I condemn no one.
- Then the matter is capable of question?
- Certainly.
But that you owe obedience to the King is not capable of question.
So weigh a doubt against a certainty and sign.
Some men think the earth is round, others think it flat.
It is a matter capable of question.
But if it is flat, will the King's command make it round?
And if it is round, will the King's command flatten it?
No, I will not sign.
Then you have more regard for your own doubt than the King's command?
- For myself I have no doubt.
- No doubt of what?
No doubt that I will not take this oath.
But why I will not, you,
Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.
I might get it out of you in other ways.
You threaten like a dockside bully.
How should I threaten?
Like a minister of state, with justice!
Justice is what you're threatened with.
Then I am not threatened.
Gentlemen, can't I go to bed?
Aye. The prisoner may retire as he requests.
- Unless you...
- I see no purpose in prolonging this.
Then, goodnight, Thomas.
May I have one or two more books?
Why, you have books?
Yes.
I didn't know, you shouldn't have.
May I see my family?
No.
Captain!
Master Secretary?
Have you ever heard the prisoner speak of the King's divorce, supremacy...
- ... or the King's marriage?
- No, not a word.
If he does, you will repeat it to me.
Of course.
Rich.
Secretary?
Tomorrow morning, remove the prisoner's books.
Is that necessary?
With regards to this case, the King is becoming impatient.
- Aye, with you.
- With all of us.
The King's impatience will embrace a duke or two.
Master Secretary.
Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.
The Attorney General for Wales.
His post is vacant.
You said that I might approach you.
Not now, Rich.
He must submit. He must!
Rack him.
No. The King's conscience will not permit it.
We have to find some other way.
Sir Thomas!
Father!
What? Margaret?
Father!
Meg. For God's sake, they haven't put you in here?
- No, sir, a visit.
- A brief one, Sir Thomas.
Father.
- Good morning, husband.
- Good morning.
Good morning, Will.
Well, this is a hellish place!
Except it's keeping me from you, my dears, it isn't so bad.
It's remarkably like any other place.
- It drips!
- Yes. It's too near the river.
Well, what is it?
Father, come out!
Swear to the act and come out!
Is this why they've let you come?
Yes.
Meg's under oath to persuade you.
That was silly, Meg.
How do you plan to do that?
Father.
"God more regards the thoughts of the heart than the words of the mouth."
- Well, so you've always told me.
- Yes.
Then say the words of the oath and in your heart think otherwise.
What is an oath then, but words we say to God?
Listen, Meg.
When a man takes an oath, he's holding his own self in his own hands... like water.
And if he opens his fingers then, he needn't hope to find himself again.
Some men aren't capable of this, but I'd be loathed to think your father one of them.
- I have another argument.
- Oh, Meg.
In any state that was half good, you would be raised up high, not here...
- ... for what you've done already.
- All right.
It's not your fault the state's three-quarters bad.
No.
If you elect to suffer for it, you elect to be a hero.
That's very neat.
But look now. If we lived in a state where virtue was profitable... common sense would make us saintly.
But since we see that avarice, anger, pride and stupidity... commonly profit far beyond charity, modesty, justice and thought... perhaps we must stand fast a little... even at the risk of being heroes.
But in reason!
Haven't you done as much as God can reasonably want?
Well, finally it isn't a matter of reason.
Finally, it's a matter of love.
You're content then to be shut up here with mice and rats...
- ... when you might be home with us?
- Content?
If they'd open a crack that wide, I'd be through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.
I haven't told you what the house is like without you.
Don't, Meg.
- What we do in the evening without you.
- Meg, have done.
We don't read because we've no candles.
We don't talk because we wonder what they're doing to you.
The King is more merciful.
He doesn't use the rack.
Two minutes to go, sir.
- I thought you'd like to know.
- Two minutes!
- Jailer!
- Sorry, sir. Two minutes.
Listen, you must leave the country.
All of you must leave the country.
- And leave you?
- It makes no difference.
They won't let me see you again.
You must all go on the same day, but not on the same boat.
- Different boats from different ports.
- After the trial, then.
There'll be no trial, they have no case.
Do this for me, I beseech you.
- Will?
- Yes, sir.
- Margaret?
- Yes.
Alice?
- Alice, I command you!
- Right.
This is splendid.
- I know who packed this.
- I packed it.
Yes.
You still make a superlative custard, Alice.
Do I?
That's a nice dress you have on.
Nice color anyway.
My God, you think little of me!
I know I'm a fool... but I'm not such a fool as to be lamenting for my dresses... or to relish complimenting on my custards.
I'm well rebuked.
- Alice...
- No!
I'm sick with fear when I think of the worst they may do to me.
But worse than that will be to go with you not understanding why I go.
I don't.
If you can tell me that you understand,
I might make a good death, if I have to.
- Your death's no good to me.
- You must tell me that you understand.
I don't!
I don't believe this had to happen!
If you say that
I don't see how I'm to face it.
It's the truth!
- You're an honest woman.
- Much good may it do me.
I'll tell you what I'm afraid of... that when you've gone,
I shall hate you for it.
You mustn't, Alice.
You mustn't.
As for understanding, I understand you're the best man I ever met or ever likely to.
And if you go, God knows why I suppose, though as God's my witness...
God's kept deadly quiet about it.
And if any one wants to know my opinion of the King and his Council... he only has to ask for it!
Why, it's a lion I married.
A lion. A lion.
This is good.
It's very good.
Sorry, Sir Thomas!
- Oh, for pity's sake!
- Time's up, sir.
- But one more minute!
- You don't know what you're asking.
- Come along, Miss.
- For heaven's sake.
Now, don't do that, sir.
Now, madam, don't make trouble.
Come along, please, Lady Alice.
Take your muddy paws off me!
Filthy, stinking, gutter-fed, turnkey!
I'll see you suffer for this!
Goodbye.
You must understand my position, sir.
I'm a plain, simple man and I just want to keep out of trouble.
Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Savior, clear my wits.
Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God, comfort my wife and daughter... and forgive me for them.
Sir Thomas More, though you have heinously offended the King's majesty... we hope that if you'll even now fore think and repent of obstinate opinion... you may still taste his gracious pardon.
My lords, I thank you.
As for the matters you may charge me with...
I fear from my present weakness, that neither my wit... nor my memory will serve... to make sufficient answer.
I should be glad to sit down.
A chair for the prisoner.
Master Secretary Cromwell, have you the charge?
- I have, my lord.
- Then read the charge.
"That you did willfully and maliciously deny and deprive...
"our liege, Lord Henry, of his undoubted certain title...
"Supreme Head of the Church in England."
But, I have never denied this title.
At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth, and again at Richmond... you stubbornly refused the oath.
Was this no denial?
No, this was silence.
And for my silence,
I am punished with imprisonment.
- Why have I been called again?
- On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.
For which the punishment is not imprisonment.
Death... comes for us all, my lords.
Yes, even for kings he comes.
The death of kings is not in question,
Sir Thomas.
Nor mine, I trust, until I'm proven guilty.
Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas, as it always has!
Is that so, my lord?
Then I'll keep a good grip on it.
So, Sir Thomas... you stand on your silence?
I do.
But, gentlemen of the jury... there are many kinds of silence.
Consider first the silence of a man when he is dead.
Suppose we go into the room where he is laid out and we listen.
What do we hear?
Silence.
What does it betoken, this silence?
Nothing. This is silence pure and simple.
But let us take another case.
Suppose I were to take a dagger from my sleeve... and make to kill the prisoner with it.
And my lordships there, instead of crying out for me to stop, maintain their silence.
That would betoken!
It would betoken a willingness that I should do it.
And under the law, they would be guilty with me.
So silence can, according to the circumstances... speak.
Let us consider now the circumstances of the prisoner's silence.
The oath was put to loyal subjects all over the country who all declared...
His Grace's title to be just and good!
But when it came to the prisoner, he refused!
He calls this "silence."
Yet, is there a man in this court...
Is there a man in this country... who does not know
Sir Thomas More's opinion of this title?
Yet, how can this be?
Because this silence betokened... nay, this silence was not silence at all, but most eloquent denial!
Not so.
Not so, Master Secretary.
The maxim of the law is,
"Silence gives consent."
If, therefore, you wish to construe what my silence betokened... you must construe that I consented, not that I denied.
Is that in fact what the world construes from it?
Do you pretend that is what you wish the world to construe from it?
The world must construe according to its wits.
This court must construe according to the law.
My lords, I wish to call
Sir Richard Rich!
Richard Rich, come into court.
Richard Rich!
"I do swear the evidence I'll give before the court shall be the truth...
"the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."
"So help me God," sir.
"So help me God."
Now Rich, on May 12, you were at the Tower?
- I was.
- For what purpose?
I was sent to carry away the prisoner's books.
- Did you talk with the prisoner?
- Yes.
Did you talk of the King's supremacy of the Church?
Yes.
What did you say?
I said to him, "Supposing there were an act of parliament...
"to say that I, Richard Rich, were to be king.
"Would not you, Master More, take me for king?"
"That I would," he said.
"For then you would be king."
Yes?
Then he said,
"But I will put you a higher case.
"How, if there were an act of parliament, to say that God should not be God?"
- This is true and then you said...
- Silence!
Continue.
But then I said,
"I will put you a middle case.
"Parliament has made our King
Head of the Church.
"Why will you not accept him?"
Well?
And then he said,
"Parliament had not the power to do it."
Repeat the prisoner's words.
He said:
"Parliament had not the competence."
Or words to that effect.
He denied the title!
He did.
In good faith, Rich, I am sorrier for your perjury than my peril.
- Do you deny this?
- Yes!
You know if I were a man who heeded not the taking of an oath...
I need not be here.
Now, I will take an oath.
If what Master Rich has said is true...
I pray I may never see God in the face.
Which I would not say, were it otherwise, for anything on earth!
- That is not evidence.
- Is it probable...
Is it probable that after so long a silence on this... the very point so urgently sought of me...
I should open my mind to such a man as that?
Sir Richard, do you wish to modify your testimony?
No, my lord.
Is there anything you wish to take away from it?
No, my lord.
Have you anything to add?
No, my lord.
- Have you, Sir Thomas?
- To what purpose?
I am a dead man.
You have your will of me.
Then the witness may withdraw.
There is one question
I would like to ask the witness.
That's a chain of office you're wearing.
May I see it?
The Red Dragon.
What's this?
Sir Richard is appointed
Attorney General for Wales.
For Wales.
Why Richard, it profits a man nothing to give his soul for the whole world.
But for Wales.
My lords! I've done.
The jury will retire and consider the evidence.
Considering the evidence, it shouldn't be necessary for them to retire.
Is it necessary?
Then is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?
Guilty, my lord!
Sir Thomas More, you have been found guilty of high treason.
- The sentence of the court...
- My lords!
When I was practicing the law, the manner was to ask the prisoner... before pronouncing sentence, if he had anything to say.
Have you anything to say?
Yes.
Since the court has determined to condemn me...
God knoweth how...
I will now discharge my mind... concerning the indictment and the King's title.
The indictment is grounded in an act of parliament... which is directly repugnant... to the law of God and His Holy Church.
The supreme government of which no temper able person... may by any law presume to take upon him.
This was granted... by the mouth... of our Savior, Christ Himself... to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome whilst He lived... and was personally present... here on earth.
It is therefore insufficient in law... to charge any Christian to obey it.
And more than this... the immunity of the Church is promised both in Magna Carta... and in the King's own coronation oath.
Now, we plainly see you are malicious!
Not so.
I am the King's true subject... and I pray for him and all the realm.
I do none harm.
I say none harm.
I think none harm.
And if this be not enough to keep a man alive... then in good faith, I long not to live.
Nevertheless... it is not for the supremacy that you have sought my blood... but because I would not bend to the marriage!
You have been found guilty of high treason.
The sentence of the court is that you be taken... to the Tower of London... until the day hence to the appointment... for your execution!
I am commanded by the King to be brief... and since I am the King's obedient subject... brief I will be.
I die His Majesty's good servant... but God's first.
I forgive you, right readily.
Be not afraid of your office.
You send me to God.
You're very sure of that, Sir Thomas?
He will not refuse one who is so blithe to go to him.
Thomas More's head was stuck on Traitor's Gate for a month.
Then his daughter, Margaret, removed it and kept it 'til her death.
Cromwell was beheaded for high treason five years after More.
The Archbishop was burned at the stake.
The Duke of Norfolk should have been executed for high treason... but the King died of syphilis the night before.
Richard Rich became
Chancellor of England... and died in his bed.
This tale was told by chance, so it hardly merits praise.
But that does not matter.
There are many others like it still waiting to be penned.
Our tale takes place during a severe winter, with frosts as passionate as Christianity at the time.
Better to huddle by the fire and remember times past.
Foolish deeds are scattered at random.
Why listen? Is there sense in what was written?
By chance, haphazardly, for poetry's sake, at the behest of a wandering echo, and because the oldest things carry over into the present.

PART I: STRATA, THE WOLF-MAN
How two Kozlik brothers hunted on the royal road.
How the neighbor, whose life was saved by a miracle, turned this to good account.
One-armed man!
How far is Boleslav?
How far? Can't you hear me?
Only caught one hare all day, a German one!
See that mare? Something, eh?
They're counts from Saxony.
This one speaks Czech.
He's the old man's footman.
If we don't get rid of them we can expect a good chase!
Put him in fetters!
Stop, you beast! Mangy animal!
Greetings, Mr Lazar!
Greetings to you.
Look at you.
Beast
I took part of a harness.
You know my louts.
They wanted to know what was going on here.
Surely not misfortune.
They have to see everything for themselves.
I said we had to go on, but would they listen?
Shut up!
Pray!
God...
Almighty God...
Be blessed for bringing hope at the close of unhappiness.
You break souls like a potter, and mold them again.
For there is mercy in the depths of your anger.
You have permitted my sins, but do not allow your servant
Mikolaé to commit mortal sins.
Remember my daughter Marketa, and deliver me from evil.
Without me, she will fall prey to impure worldly might.
About Kozlik, Lord of Rohééek, who had eight sons and nine daughters, and about the captive chosen to become the Bishop of Hennau.
Jan!
Put the mare in the stable.
I don't need the stallion.
I'm almost out of oats
Slaughter it!
Mikoléé!
Go away!
Alexandra!
Adam, give me back that chain.
Who is that?
Tell me. Who is Lazar?
Carrion-vulture! Mangy dog!
What is wrong with you?
How could you let a ghost from the road fleece you.
I didn't. He came and went, a few straps...
Why did you let him get away?
Why didn't you murder the scum?
Without a prayer!
- He had no weapon.
- Like those two?
We can ask for ransom.
You scum. Will you go get it?
Or will you invite his relatives from Saxony here?
They must go! Both of them!
NQW!
See, brother?
If his father hadn't run off you could've gotten them all
What? Who escaped?
Come with me!
And you get out of here!
Why didn't you tell me that?
So they escaped! No one has ever escaped from you!
You dog-head!
Know what you've done? Look.
Look!
See?
So? You said they had to go.
We're frozen to death.
Frozen stiff. If someone tries to get us... for example...
... for example...
... through the window.
Adam!
Stop!
- But in the courtyard you...
- Do what I said.
How Kozlik fared in Boleslav with the Royal Regiment Captain.
(At one time this man was a merchant who brewed from hops.
Thus, they called him "Beer. ")
... catching flies...
I'll get you
Did the beasts chase you?
- My son...
- The fawn. See him?
You fawn. We'll starve
So? Why?
Take the boys, and follow the trail.
I left my knife and hat there.
You should have known better.
- It's like an icicle!
- I want a drink!
Couldn't Jan go to Boleslav?
You act as if you were fifty!
Have them wake Mikoléé.
Did they take your horses?
Captain?
Where's the captain?
Where's your good man, people?
- What do you want?
- Lord...
The lord is a noble but he steals.
- I come in good faith.
- No, you shed blood.
- You'll come to a bad end
- Don't threaten me.
- Here. Have a drink.
- I came to talk.
Too late.
The royal patience has run out.
Since when has the King worried about poor yeomen?
Even a king must drive flies from his face.
You want to catch them, Captain?
I'm glad the regiment doesn't have to hunt you down
Guards!
Your showing off is worthless, peddler!
God!
You crone!
What do you have against the captain?
I couldn't find
... the chink in his armor.
God's will was not with me.
About the visit to the neighbor at Oboist, and about what
Lazar's daughter learned.
Where is your master, wise people?
Come out, Lazar.
Greet your guest.
Or shall I help you, you fox?
Welcome to Oboist.
Hurry up. Things look bad.
The Royal Captain has left Boleslav.
But if we lay in wait for him together as my father said,
- near the place -Why me?
- ... where I gave you your life!
I have nothing to do with the King. I don't kill or rob.
Did you inherit that?
The King knows about you, highwayman.
Oh, God!
- If his soldiers get you
- I'll redeem myself!
Not until Judgement Day!
- But don't rely on royal mercy!
- The King is just.
But those who stop his regiment will hang at the roadside.
Gracious God, Mary, and Jesus!
If You are omnipotent, show your strength at Obofiété, make my father change...
You knave!
Thieving carrion!
Show him!
Stop, that's enough!
Leave him alone!
You knaves!
You've made a mistake!
Don't you know Kozlik has more sons than sheep?
God, Marketa!
Marketa!
I would be none the richer for killing him.
Let him be. Let him go.
Let him die according to God's will.
Such a pagan, a liar.
He is against the King.
Get out of the way!
Marketa...
Do you hear me, Marketa?
I hope you don't believe him
I've never spilled blood.
Perhaps in self-defense.
To take what a wealthy man leaves... who isn't weak?
The just are allowed to trespass seven times a day as God says.
And here on earth, what you don't take, you don't have.
Don't jump to conclusions.
Even God's love is stronger than His holy justice.
Learn to forgive, Marketa.
Ask God to forgive us.
God will hear the one who has been promised to Him.
He will not refuse you.
About Kodiak's retreat from Rohééek, and the fall of his sons and daughter, Alexandra.
It's Jan. Damn it
Get that horse!
- What is it?
- Get that horse!
- Lazar scum!
- Kill them all!
- Off with their heads!
- Father! -He deserves it!
- You look a sight!
- Shut up!
- Lazar will pay for this.
- Stay out of others' debts
He stood against them alone!
Christian!
Lazar's dogs are scared of their own wind!
- Are you going to leave Lazar to the will of God? -So, what?
The captain is after us, and you want to burn Lazar?
- We'll get you by dawn
- Lazar won't escape us
As the snow melts, so does evil.
Alexandra!
Don't summon the grim reaper!
Get out of here!
You'll fall into the captain's hands, Jan. He's coming to Lazar
By the time Beer gets here...
- He'll never find Obofiété!
- Come out!
Asses!
Where did you see the regiment?
- Half a day's journey from here.
- What do you mean?
- In deep snow...
- Tell me!
Maybe it'll take a day
It won't be good if the captain settles in Obofiété.
Seven, no more!
That's quite enough for that Obofiété scum!
I want Lazar alive! Understand?
And spare the horses!
Did you at least kill one, mutton-head?
I didn't expect this from you.
Why are you still here?
Get me a horse!
Move it!
Go on!
Did you really not kill a soul?
What?
Leave it up to us, and go.
I want him to go with us.
About the campaign which became a funeral.
How the captain reflected on the senseless death of his aide who was killed by Kozlik's sons before Obofiété and is buried at Rohééek.
- Stay out of the courtyard!
- I just want to feed the birds!
Don't go into the courtyard!
What is wrong with you?
Half as much meat would do.
And all those spices...
Oh, God...
What have I done? The larder is empty, and spring is far off.
In Kozlik's league?
You didn't want that!
What league? Push out the devil, and a demon slips in.
It's brisk!
The road will be firm.
Like a barn floor.
Something smells good...
- It's Arni.
- Coltsfoot and butter bur
- The marshes are frozen.
- Butter bur heals wounds.
I know, Marketa.
You're not leaving, are you?
Don't worry. I won't leave your little nest exposed.
You won't catch up with Kozlik in the woods.
The King's law is longer than Kozlik's course.
I come from a good line.
I know what my coat-of-arms commands.
Your property and Marketa are under my protection.
Soviéka.
- Does it hurt?
- Your hand is blessed.
Such healers are rare.
- Not a healer but an angel!
- Who marked you?
- The Angel of Mercy.
- No, you can't do that!
Sorry. A sincere mind does not seek words.
A bird's breast weighs heavily on the knight's heart!
So long as some remains when I signal the attack.
The time has come, Captain.
Marshall, I see you mean business.
Your advice was always worth shit!
What is there to advise, peddler?
You lead your regiment like cattle from shed to shed.
- Some heroism!
- The King needs the law upheld.
The King entrusted me with the captain's mace.
I travel the land waging a merchant's war.
While your noble talk marches to the mortuary.
Noble... One babbles, the second murders, the third...
What did Kozlik want?
He wanted to buy my horses.
- So are you stealing horses now?
- That's not fair.
I don't even have enough food for my own geldings.
Are you reproaching us because of a few oats?
Royal protection isn't free.
Some have even starved to death.
You'll make up for it.
We know about your tricks
- Just gossip.
- Fine.
Just don't end up like your neighbor.
Catch him! Kill him!
Shut the gates!
Stop staring, and go to bed!
We didn't come a-courting.
Rohééek is empty, Captain.
- The birds have flown away!
- Shall we follow the trail?
It's fresh
Haste is not a good helper.
Jesus, why do you punish me? So many people!
- The horses!
- Horses for the Cornet!
Wherever will we put them all?
- They won't help us!
- Where to put them all?
Out of the frying pan...
Some reinforcements!
They have no provisions.
You reproached me for being foolish and imprudent.
Are you waiting for reinforcements?
You count horsemen like you count coins.
Well observed, Soviéka.
Wait, that doesn't look like...
Those aren't...
The King entrusted me with his soldiers and horsemen.
- Your blood's frozen in your veins
- And I look after them. -Halt!
Fear is in command!
Halt, you damned soul!
God. See that fool?
Won't even put on a fur!
- Snooping around, Captain?
- Looking for silver, peddler?
- Mangy dogs! Shut up!
- Get out, but leave Lazar here!
We're lighting his way!
- Devious pole-cats!
- Stay away from Rohééek.
Or your life will end.
- Just try it, pig face.
- We'll make a gelding of you
Come out! Show yourself!
- I've stuffed myself enough!
- You bloated peddler!
I'll find you and impale you
I'll get you all, murder you without mercy
And I'll cast your legs into the woods, fuckers!
- You are repulsive!
- Fuckers!
Sons of bitches!
God shows us that punishment does not like to wait!
No soldiers will rest, nor cattle, nor arms.
I shall hunt them like never before.
If they are killed defending themselves,
I shall take their children!
How Lazar, rid of his worries with his neighbor,
(whom the captain chases through the woods) gave his daughter away without a dowry.
Lord Lazar...
His reason has been dulled.
His speech is muddled.
He brays like a donkey.
- God has also given you a graceful daughter. -I know.
And a fool instead of an heir.
That is blasphemy.
I am giving you what is most dear to me.
She has been looking forward to staying here.
She has said goodbye to everyone at home.
Long yearning, great joy.
She got her reward.
Easter will be here soon.
I also donned the habit before Christ's Resurrection.
Don't take me for a bad man.
This past year has been awful.
The soldiers came, and you know about my neighbor.
Farmers who were not affected are richer now.
God knows her dowry must be fitting. Her coffer is full.
There will be money, but nearly all my livestock are gone.
We are not your confessors.
Your grace.
You will be here again before the last snow melts.
Come, child.
I shall have sheep, too.
If the cloister waits.
Just like the good Lord.
The just Lord.
The all-knowing.
Greetings, noble.
May your house be filled with health and happiness.
May your oxen thrive. Give me a coin for God's sake!
- If you've something to give.
- Hear him, the vagabond.
My feet are frozen stiff.
The monasteries used to be poor, but now?
- People only take.
- What do you regret?
There will be no children to carry on the line.
You were the one who vowed me.
It'll be sad here without you
What have we here?
It can be fixed.
The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away.
See her? She's a nun!
Slow down!
Praise to the Lord.
A thaw is coming.
For the mercy of God...
Boys".
Do not act like beasts!
Why are you taking revenge?
Mikoléé!
Don't sin because of us.
Remember the Lord!
Lord, have mercy on these wretches!
I'll never forget this, Mikoléé!
Mikoléé...
Christ...
- Have mercy!
- Enough!
We are at your mercy, and we cannot protect ourselves.
Do not commit murder!
Do not commit murder, Mikoléé.
- I'll redeem myself!
- With what?
For God's sake, no!
Take what you want, but don't harm Marketa!
Don't be an animal!
She has been promised to God!
My Lord enabled me to repay my debt. We're even.
Since you're tolerant, and you'll be my creditor grant us this virgin.
The good Lord will be glad to share her!
You can't do that!
Get up.
Go on.
Straba is thirsty for blood. Keep him out.
- Why is he crying?
- He mocks people and himself.
They threw his mother to the wolves.
He grew up and became a human among wolves, and a wolf among humans.
Disdain fosters his pride.
Dislike breathes hatred.
Scorned by all, Straba scorns them all in turn.
He disgraced the holy ancestral places with a grimace.
He does not want to bow to people or the gods.
He is free like a wolf, like an animal in the woods, but he still has a human heart, and that heart is full of sorrow.
He grew up, and those whose word is law would have him cast out.
What happened to him?
He heard the men's counsel, and laughed.
The quiet laugh of a wolf.
He was beautiful.
He chose the most comely of maidens.
She feared him, yet she feared her father even more.
The father decides whom you will submit to.
Straba raged, and spilled the blood from her throat.
They pounced on him, and put him in irons.
A horrible punishment awaited him.
Burn him at the stake, said one.
Another said let stallions trample him.
They could not agree on how to kill him.
Then the oldest one pronounced the sentence.
May he have no place among humans, free as a wolf.
His punishment would be in himself.
Woden cast down lightning, but there were no clouds.
And Straba?
Helaughsu. with the quiet laugh of a wolf.
He leaves, baring his teeth with that quiet laugh.
Arrows had no power over him.
He was free as a wolf.
His life was not measured by the solstices.
Yet he was alone.
Those who do not suffer cannot experience delight.
Life has no value without pain.
At the time he longed for pain, and he sought death.
He returned to those who had cast him out.
But many years had passed, and they had all grown old.
They only knew him from the ancient tales.
The young men came at him with arms. One remembered, shouting,
Stay away from him! He has come for death and we shall deny him.
All retreated and mocked him.
He had returned to die, yet death was denied him.
Their mockery burned.
He trembled like an aspen leaf.
He searched for the place where his heart was.
He seized the closest knife, and stabbed himself there.
But the knife broke, and no blood was drawn.
He was alone again.
Does he weep?
No. Weeping is the gift of relief.
Men do not know it.
Their pride pursues eternal punishment.
Straba is from their line.
His ancestor came from the woman he wed.
Shut up, crone!
Don't summon evil.
All of you bear the mark of his blood.
But the curse cannot touch the seventh son.
What are you doing?
- Why have the guards stopped?
- The captain's crossed the ford.
- Look!
- Where?
What a mess!
Where are you supposed to be?
Are you on watch here?
Where did that whore come from?
Put the shoes of nails on her.
Let her go to hell!
Why didn't you bring me Lazar?
WW didn't you?
Such dishonor, Kozlik!
Act with chivalry!
Don't torture a defenseless girl.
I offer you my share of the inheritance.
Christian!
Christian...
Let me go!
What are you doing here?
Fools!
Bitches!
Chains!
Bring the chains!
PART II: THE LAMB OF GOD
Spring was fast approaching.
Shepherds and wayfarers began talking animatedly because the sun angels could be heard in the wind.
Who could think of a sad maiden's tale now?
Who would heed the mad ramblings of louts?
The Lord, returning to the welcoming lowlands, fixes His gaze on the simplicity of those who address Him.
What are you singing?
What are you muttering?
- A prayer.
- That's no prayer.
It's a sermon
I don't know.
I don't understand...
Are you not living in sodomite sin?
You know she is no woman, as you are no lamb.
God does not like such things.
If only your voice were as good as your simplicity is great!
Look".
See? The Lord is showing us the way.
We'll have milk and warmth
Perhaps a nice apple.
Come on, we're just in time.
Could it be a christening?
Or perhaps a wedding?
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost,
Christ's holy intercessors raise their hands for your sins to be forgiven.
The priest's prayers rise up to the clouds.
You have a wonderful estate!
Step back a little.
God bless you, nobles.
May this house be filled with help and happiness.
First, my lord...
What is it, little one?
May your oxen thrive.
Give me a groschen!
If you have something to give, don't leave me with nothing.
My feet are frozen stiff.
I don't understand, but you have a nice lamb.
Only a sheep sent to me by a higher will.
But you found a nice fold!
You got away in time!
- Out of the frying pan...
- St. George, a just patron.
Where's the master?
The groom nailed him to the gate like a bat!
And he dragged the sheep away on a string!
What are you muttering?
That you've come just in time!
How Bernard found the soldier who robbed him, and what became of the jests of Kozlik's sons.
Thieves... stinking swine... !
God, do not allow...
They've encircled me...
They're strong as oxen...
What are they doing!
Mangy animals!
Swept away to the hellish world!
Keep us away from those mangy hands! Little one!
Murder with terror until they are silenced!
May they die! Amen!
Holy Christ...
... where are you, little one?
Where did you put her?
Did St. George help you?
They'll rejoice, for You have lost an impious soul
Where is my sheep? Fucker!
The impious are preparing their bows and arrows.
His mouth is full of evil words.
You're finished, swine!
Little one!
God...
... where are you, little one?
Little one...
Little wanderer...
Come out!
Come out, I say!
Foolish beast!
May the devil take you!
Hurry UP!
Quietly!
Get out of here, and take the mares with you!
He's walked into the trap.
Wretched beast! Outrun him!
You won't escape, fucker!
Faster, beast!
Kill him, the wretch!
- The mares!
- Hold him!
Use the knife!
Wretch...
Do you call this a catch? And the others?
The carts? The provisions? God.
What'd I give the mares?
Stop!
Stop!
Stop. I say!
You, get up.
There's no need for haste.
Do you belong to the yeoman they call Kozlik?
Is he dumb?
Tie him to the saddle!
He'll lead us there
Let's keep going.
Let us carry on!
About the scourge on the chain and Mikoléé' memories which awaken Alexandra's noble beloved and about the revenge of Adam, the One-Armed.
Drahuée!
Come out!
Here.
Give each of the falcons one.
And give the buzzard two.
What are you lurking around here for?
Go home!
Are you hunting without hounds?
Are you waiting by a mouse hole?
You must know we are bound to him with fetters.
Tell him we'll share the suffering. It's God's wish
My lord would like... to express his thoughts.
We wish to share the adversity.
It is only polite.
We hope God will praise us for it one day.
An impure deed has poisoned his blood.
God marked his left arm.
Exorcism did nothing.
Adam will die, Kozlik!
Take him to the courtyard.
Have Alexandra go there, too.
You will look into your brother's face until he dies.
Then you'll be buried with him
If he is saved, you will be protected, too.
God will decide.
Stop! Get back, you beast!
Where has he brought us?
Stop!
Hold him!
Give me that!
Not so fast.
Leave some for the journey!
There isn't far to go.
We're nearly at Rohééek.
Give him to us, Captain!
That scourge is mine!
I'll do with him What I like!
The King gave me a decree, and you are his servant!
Give the rogue up! I order you!
I tell you,
I won't let this through!
Must we beg you, Captain?
About the last supper where Bernard's sheep dies, and about the hour in which death assumes power.
Who've you brought here?
You clown!
Come out.
Come out into God's light!
Lament, you boars!
Repent for your atrocities.
Adam sends a confessor!
Who are you?
They took my sheep.
I travel the world, and people give us bread.
Who sent you?
God.
They laugh when I speak to my sheep.
God's wisdom pressed us into the dust.
We recognize love and
God in this lovely world.
- Let us pray to the Lord.
- Wait!
Not so fast!
Pour some wine.
Where is that brat?
Don't let him stand there.
Your Simon's a lot of use!
- Did you rub down the horses?
- There's a lot of straw.
- I hope his skull freezes!
- He could do it for the baby.
Just look after the spit!
- Father!
- The spit!
- We have an unchristened child.
- God bless us, noble lady!
If your soul is merciful, do not deny us.
I'll christen him.
Give me grain, salt, holy water
Don't you use wine?
Not every kind.
Come here...
Have some!
- Try it.
- Kozlik...
- Should I...
- Drain the jug!
To your health!
- Father, I'll take you
- Thank the Lord.
- This way, Father.
- Very nice. I'll christen him
He likes his drink.
You go to sleep early.
The fields are barren.
- Like birds in heaven.
- Are you hungry?
Like a meadow lily...
Like a lamb of God...
You with the golden voice!
Have a drink!
Think of the children!
What do you want?
Am I to give myself up, then?
- What will become of them?
- Mind your own affairs!
- God acts in mysterious ways.
- What will become of them?
Wolves!
If not for all his aides...
The captain would have either died or run off.
Where's he lurking?
At our neighbor's.
- You destroyed his property.
- He deserved it.
May God judge you,
Why are you invoking God?
- May the saints protect you.
- Why are you invoking Him?
The captain is not far.
Are you threatening me?
Think of your salvation.
Think of your own, you old hag!
- Age has dulled our reason.
- I don't deny my sins.
I drew my sword often, but
I never harmed the defenseless.
My deeds will terrify me at the Last Judgement!
I will be afraid, but not ashamed!
I led wars with men against the King's will.
For 10 years he rebuked me with armed men.
I answered them as I would an enemy.
My sword is no shorter than the captain's.
Get up!
Wake up the priest!
Such rabble!
My little one.
Open up!
I want to talk to the father.
Little one...
- I'm listening.
- I heard the signal of the wolf
Black beasts and deer are approaching.
Saddle the horses.
It was a warning, Kozlik!
- Get up!
- Aren't you scared?
Stop!
Come back!
Come here!
Throw them the chains as a reminder.
Take the horses to where the stream branches.
Don't move until I say so.
Take Jifi with you.
No, I'll send Mikoléé
Hence!
I said silence!
Have them take the lamb!
Why do you constantly try me?
Why can I not swallow my sinful saliva?
Whores!
In the name of God and the King, yeoman Kozlik, known as "Goat. "
The guardian of justice speaks with you.
Our Lord and King.
Open the gate and lay down your arms. Your iniquity is over.
Go back to Boleslav!
My gates are strong, and I've lost the key!
You have wronged the next Bishop of Hennau.
The King demands to know what you have done with him.
Answer, and give yourself up!
Listen, Captain.
The King is the lord of us all.
But war is the lord of kings.
War is the judge of my actions.
I may defeat your troops and talk with the king's envoy.
Perhaps I will be defeated and killed.
The right of victory will decide.
May your message be carried away by the wind.
- Halt!
- War is declared, and I have no scribe!
Thieving louts!
If you do not yield, you will be killed!
And your family will starve!
Before I storm your castle,
I'll kill one of yours as a warning
I know nothing of the Emperor!
We will bargain!
If you wrong my son, they'll need a new bishop!
What are you waiting for?
Finish him off!
Get back. Don't move!
Kill him, father!
Form a line!
Line up!
Get back!
Line up!
Here you are!
Stupid, mangy, asses... !
Cornet!
Round up your men and come back!
Get what you can! The animals!
What do you have in your hands?
Make a ladder!
Change mounts!
Cut them all into one!
Get the ropes!
I'll show you!
There you have it.
Where love led the Bishop of Hennau, and about the soliloquy of madmen.
Get her!
Concubine!
Alexandra!
They did quite a job on you, the beasts!
There's not enough for two, but have some...
Never mind.
You wouldn't have a pinch of salt, would you?
Smells good.
We defend ourselves in need like she-bears, but at other times we attack our loved ones like lynxes!
Why do you appeal to God?
They made a lout into a lord.
Did you hear the captain?
Get up! Let's go find shelter.
They invited me to supper in a monastery.
It was Easter. Whores of Herod!
Stupid mercenaries.
To cast out a beggar...
What was it called?
The monastery was on Turnov Road.
Don't you know it?
Suddenly it was full of soldiers. I was hungry.
But the captain!
Cornets... Drums...
Bad farmers clear woods.
Bad kings start wars.
You're all pagans.
Hear that? What...
They tried to kill me in a pub in Boleslav!
What henchmen they were!
Stop staring!
Hear me?
Christ! Savior!
Holy Virgin!
Give him some water.
He didn't rob or steal.
His head was cracked in two.
He just put loam on his wound and rode home!
- The gallows await him.
- You mean the axe!
Noble blood gets the sword.
On the fate of men and the lot of widows.
Lady Katerina!
Lord Mikoléé!
Praise be to God, at least you are here!
Come and rest!
We don't have that horse anymore...
- I didn't expect...
- Do you know about...
What about Jifi?
- And Burjan?
- Did you see mine?
Yes, I did.
- Eat this.
- Are you fishing?
Whatever the flood brings.
I'd sell some in Boleslav
- What are you thinking of?
- We won't get in without wares.
- Why Boleslav?
- Is he alive?
- He's no use to us otherwise.
- I know what Kozlik would order.
We'll bring a basket of fish
We'll be like farmers, and we'll charge the prison
He'd tell you to hide from the King's wrath, and return later to rebuild Rohééek.
Attack the prison with stones? The two of us?
A single wolf can defeat a pack of dogs if the time is right.
We'll storm Boleslav!
Shut up and fish.
We would need a regiment!
Kozlik is dead.
If not, he will get the axe.
No power can drag him from death but God's.
- Then God will guide us.
- He sinned like a soldiers.
Wish him a peaceful death to pay for his sins.
Do you want the executioner to take him?
We are both old and we await death.
You protect yourselves and your progeny.
Allow the aged a peaceful grave.
Remember the living!
Spring shall pass, and soon we shall sow.
Keep going along this road.
Go home.
I took you from Oboist against your will
No one will reproach you.
Go.
Go. Cheer up Lazar and wait.
I know what happened, and that you are sad.
I know you love me, but we must save Kozlik from dishonor.
Your names are signed in hell. Be damned!
- Don't blaspheme!
- May you never know peace!
Shut up! Don't invoke God.
He I hear you. .
Their time had come.
Kozlik woke me and said,
"Take the arrows. "
I followed him.
It was pitch dark.
They called to each other.
When their time comes, they battle for a mate.
- To overcome her?
- No, a mate calls his mate.
- And she?
- She submits to the stronger.
- Forever?
- Yes.
- Only people know that...
- And the defeated?
He must have known our scent.
Kozlik wouldn't let me shoot him
- Why is he called the "Goat?"
- We've always called him that.
Once he beat me until I bled.
What happened then?
His antlers were bigger than branches.
He looked at us without fear.
Kozlik motioned for silence. We went closer.
It moved away, and we went after it.
Below the hillside there was a bare plain.
Grass, stones, lichen...
This valley was more wretched than a cemetery.
Bones, limbs, a thousand antlers on white skulls.
He stood alone in the middle. Defeated, alone.
Alone.
Kozlik whispered, "Look... "
"The solitude of death. "
He raised his antlers, and called.
- Who did he call...
- Shh!
Just a moment longer.
Take Alexandra with you.
Your thoughts stray to a place where punishment waits.
- What about me?
- We haven't given up yet.
I will be judged over and over, even if I am punished.
Do not talk of punishment, and prepare the wedding.
My brothers will bring you a message from me.
God made me love you.
You are my wife.
Alexandra!
Alexandra!
Just a moment more.
Welcome...
You are...
Send her back! Go away!
Get out!
This is not the time to return.
- What are you doing here?
- I came...
He sent you. You could've come long ago, but you liked to sin!
- You're his concubine!
- No!
Look!
I cannot watch you writhe in pus.
- I didn't abandon my will.
- Really?
Who defended me?
So, you come with reproach instead of repentance?
I came so you could judge me.
Do not judge, and you will not be judged.
Ask God for more humility.
I have not heard you renounce him yet.
Go! You broke the vow I made to God!
You are not even fit to feed the swine!
You'll be back. Trust me
The pain will subside.
The torture will pass.
I'll speak for you when the time is right.
Wait! you were my guiding light...
Do not abandon me, Lord...
Remember not my sins, but remember me by your mercy...
My parents have left me, but your hand welcomes me... for my wrongs have risen above my head like a stone...
I cannot bear them...
You measured the days, nothing lies before You.
It is nothing more than vanity for every man...
Man is transient as a shadow...
He hurries in vain...
He gathers and knows not who takes...
Judge me, Lord. I abide and hope in Your sincerity...
Try me, burn my loins and heart...
The suffering of my heart becomes greater...
Lead me from my anguish...
Teach me about your path...
Lead me to those who guard me...
Do not give me to the desires of my enemies...
For he who breathes cruelty should stand against me...
Do not unite my soul with the sinful...
... and the murderous man of my life...
... and the murderous...
... and the murderous man of my life...
In his hands is ignobleness...
His right hand is full of spoils...
Extend Your hand from on high...
Thunder crashes, burning coals fall on him...
Throw him on the fire...
Into a deep pit...
So he can no longer stand.
Remember your mercy, Lord...
Remember your mercy, Lord...
... and the charity you have shown through the ages...
See my suffering and wretchedness...
... and stay close to me...
Your hand presses down heavily on me...
Take your rod away from me...
From your blows I perished...
My heart has melted like wax inside me...
My strength is parched, and my tongue clings to my mouth...
For you have placed me in the dust of death...
For you have placed me in the dust of death...
My wounds have festered... for my foolishness...
Lead me in Your justice from those who watch over me for there is no sincerity in their words.
Let them fall from their counsel. Help me.
For who will celebrate
Your name in the grave?
Extend Your hand from on high...
Thunder crashes.
Burning coals fall on him.
Marketa, daughter of Lazar, do you take Mikoléé, son of Kozlik, as your husband?
I do!
Mikolaé, do you take
Marketa, daughter of Lazar...
I bind your hands with the sanctity of matrimony.
What God hath joined, let no man tear asunder.
Let's go!
You were my dearest...
What have we here? Greetings.
Just in time.
You'll find something better
Stand still!
It was mournful at Oboist
Stand still!
I found her, starving...
What are you doing here?
Come on, dear lass.
Let us three wander together.
The Lord will provide shelter
We'll have a merry winter.
Marketa, wait.
Little one!
Stop, I say! Marketa...
Where are you going?
Wait!
Marketa...
Is that all the thanks
I get for saving your life?
Stop!
Marketa...
Stop, you rascal!
Wait, Marketa!
After some time Marketa bore a son named Vaclav.
Alexandra also gave birth, and Marketa nursed both babies.
They grew up to be fine boys, but love and certainty fought against cruelty and doubt for their souls.

Part One
Gimme a strap.
Now give it a push.
I hope we'll make it.
Come on, unfasten it.
- Yeah, in a minute.
- Do it.
Cut the rope!
Poke a firebrand at his mug.
I'm flying!
Efim!
What's going on?
I'm flying!
Arkhip, I am flying!
Hey you, come and join me.
Arkhip!
SKOMOROKH. 1400
I guess they've got lots of daubers in Moscow.
No matter, we'll find some work.
Sure, but it's a shame --
My, I never noticed this birch before.
When you know you won't see it anymore --
Is it beautiful!
- Right. Ten years.
- Nine.
Nine for you, ten for me.
It's raining. Let's go.
Come on, we won't soak.
A band of skomorokhs
- you hear? -
Indulged too much in home-brewed beer.
And a boyar who came their ways
They did begin to loudly praise.
The boyar is poorly, what?
The boyarina is hot.
She puts out but not for all.
Hey, boyarina, rat-tat.
Your boyar is back.
Says the boyar,
You skomorokhs, are thieves and sots.
You should be flogged, yeah,
From Friday till Friday.
Bums, hoboes and weirdies,
May you choke with your beers.
Just you wait till you're impaled.
Here they grabbed him
Beneath his navel, above his knee
And laughing and bluffing,
Shaved him clean.
Hairless!
What a disgrace!
Even women have hair in the right place.
Hopping like a flee, the boyar cries bitterly.
So he heads for his home
And knocks on the door.
His woman looks out and cries, lo!
She didn't recognize him with his beard off.
And hit him - bang! - on the forehead.
Shame and disgrace!
Put pants on your face.
Our boyar hit the road,
Geese cackling him off.
A priest mistook him for a wench
And to the thicket dragged the wretch.
For with his pants down
His front and back would look the same.
Could we sit the storm out here?
Come on in.
Some home-brew?
- Thanks, we don't drink.
- Nor lay them gals.
God made a priest and satan made a skomorokh.
Hey you, come over here.
Give it to him.
- Where were you?
- In the courtyard.
Let's go, shall we.
Danila!
The rain is over. Let's go.
Many thanks, madam.
THEOPHANUS THE GREEK. 1405
Have mercy. I am not guilty.
- Perhaps he's not guilty.
- It's a frame-up.
Is any living soul in here?
- Want to have a look?
- Yes.
Welcome. We're going to oil-dry now.
So you are Theophanus the Greek?
That's right. Why are you looking at me? Look at our work.
And where do you come from?
The Andronnikov monastery.
So you must be Andrei Rublev.
Oh no.
I've heard of him.
Everybody praises Rublev.
He is a master.
But he could never do this.
The paints are so quiet.
My God, if it isn't --
Why did you stop praising me?
Go on.
I can't. Can't speak smoothly.
It is rightly said,
"You can grasp the essence of every thing if you name it correctly."
And Andrei... I'll say it right to his face.
He's like a brother to me.
They heap praises on him, yes.
He lays paints gently and skilfully.
But he is lacking fear - and faith!
The faith that comes from one's heart.
And simplicity.
As Epiphany said about St. Sergius' virtue,
"Simplicity without flourishes."
That's what it is.
You couldn't have said better.
I would say you are a philosopher.
D'you think it's good?
Why not follow the dictates of your heart in the darkness of ignorance?
"For in much wisdom there is much grief."
"He that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow."
Where's the drying oil?
Whose ears should I box?
- Has everybody vanished?
- I hear you work fast.
I have to. I get bored quickly.
I'd been messing with it a week once, and gave up.
- Threw it away?
- Why, no.
I pressed sauerkraut with it.
I'm fed up with it all.
Plenty of apprentices and not one of them brainy.
Don't know their ABCs.
Would you like to work for me?
Are you pulling my leg?
Not at all.
I need somebody to help me do the Annunciation Cathedral in Moscow.
Scaffolding has already been put up.
Don't think I'll cope.
I'll tell you all there is to tell.
You've got the brains.
Those dolts do it somehow.
I said no. Period.
As you wish.
You may regret it some day.
I don't forgive easily.
It's a sin.
You liked to discuss books with a poor monk and you choose to do him good.
I haven't touched a book for over two years.
And I'm not going to.
Mine is a different path.
- I will die soon.
- Don't say such things.
Yes, I will. I dreamed of an angel.
"Come with me", he said.
I said I'd die soon anyway.
So will you change your mind?
Deal. But there's one reservation.
What is it? Money?
Is fifty-fifty alright?
I'll work for free.
Only you come for me to Andronnikov.
Ask me to work for you and be your apprentice in front of the community, and Andrei Rublev.
And I will slave for you till my dying day.
- And what is your name?
- Cyril.
Orthodox believers, truth lovers and Christians!
How long are you going to torture the villain?
When are you going to stop?
Unthinkable sinners, you dare judge him.
Have you no fear of God?
The Prince commands you to come to Moscow.
You'll be doing the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanus the Greek.
He is Andrei Rublev.
Is that right?
Yes, he is Rublev and I am Cyril.
Theophanus the Greek wants you in Moscow.
I thank Theophanus.
Tell him
I'll be there.
My pate is splitting.
Get some apprentices and come tomorrow.
Any smithy around here?
Behind the chapel.
Farewell, God's folks.
Why not start out today?
Just pack up and set off.
Before Theophanus has changed his mind.
- I am not going.
- How's that?
- I can't do without you.
- That's your problem.
I thought we'd go together.
Why think for me?
I wasn't asked.
I can't go without you.
Yes, you can.
You didn't ask me.
Theophanus just beckoned you.
Don't take it close to heart.
You're not the first and not the last.
And I've got heaps of things to do here.
Very well then.
Thomas, Alexis, Peter, get ready.
You are coming with me.
Rejoice, Oh young man, in thy youth.
Let thy heart cheer thee, in the days of thy youth,
And walk in the ways of thine heart...
But know thou that for all these things
God will bring thee into judgment.
Remember now thy Creator...
While the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say,
I have no pleasure in them.
While the silver cord be not loosed, nor the golden bowl be broken, nor the pitcher be broken at the fountain.
Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was; and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is vanity.
Cyril, have you seen
Father Nicodimus?
I haven't seen him since morning.
He took my mittens and vanished into thin air.
I gotta lay in firewood and the logs are ice cold.
Why are you burning the torch?
It's morning.
Did you feed my dog?
You didn't ask me, did you?
Left something?
I've come to say goodbye.
You did.
Just to say goodbye.
My heart was heavy.
Then the devil embroiled us.
I can't live with it.
I must confess.
Will you take it?
I won't make it, Danila.
We've shared a cell for years.
I've got no one but you.
I look at the world with your eyes.
I listen to it with your ears.
With your heart--
I'm glad for you, you stupid head.
I wish you knew how much.
Go to Moscow, paint -- and I'll be proud of you.
As for the words I said earlier, it was the devil's work.
I'll be back, Danila.
Where are you going?
It's the evensong soon.
You can pray without me and I will do without you.
What's wrong with you, Cyril?
I am fed up with telling lies.
I'd rather be a layman.
Why did we leave the Trinity monastery?
Say it!
Because the monks put profit before faith.
Here we meant to serve God and what came of it?
The monastery now looks like a marketplace.
Take it. How many serfs did you give to become a monk?
And you followed the Superior and bargained with him.
For a water-meadow you wanted eternal beatitude for yourself.
You know it very well, only you won't say it.
Perhaps I would suffer this abomination if I had some talent or an aptitude for icon painting.
But God didn't give me talent, thank goodness.
I am happy that I am untalented, that is why I am honest and innocent before God.
There's one more thing
I want to say, brethren.
What can you say that we don't know?
Do you know what happens to the likes of you?
Out of my sight, you, serpent's breed.
You'll do well in the world,
Godless creature.
I say, Cyril...
"And Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the table of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, and said unto them,
My house shall be called the house of prayer."
And you made a den of thieves of it.
PASSIONS FOR ANDREI. 1406
I washed brushes for Danila for 3 years before he trusted me to clean an icon.
Do you trust me?
You lie at every step.
You came yesterday.
Your cassock was tacky.
- Where were you?
- In the bee-garden.
And you told me it was the Andronnikov monastery.
You are a sight.
Wash it away or you'll swell up like a boar.
No use. It's too late.
You are making up stories without end.
Can it be a disease?
What disease?
It must be a disease when a man tells lies and can't stop.
Look, Thomas.
- Look where?
- Oh you blockhead.
Why on earth did I make you my apprentice?
Didn't you say to Theophanus:
"This one is bright and he likes azure."
You worked hard then and did not lie.
And Theophanus said about your azure:
"Big deal, azure."
And you eat too much.
I wonder how you can paint after that.
What can I think of when my tummy is rumbling?
All I hear is the rumbling.
Lucky dog, Thomas. All's well and good for you.
It is only through praying that your heart can come from the visible to the invisible.
Lo! What is that?
So you choose to leave the apostles on the left.
Did you take the glue off the stove?
So he likes azure.
He must be flogged on Saturdays.
Where have you seen all this now when everybody is fearing for his ass?
Moscow women gave their hair to Tatars for a levy.
It's better to shed one's hair than suffer indignities.
Customarily
Russian women are humiliated and unhappy.
But that's another story.
Tell me frankly: are our people benighted or not?
They are. The question is who is to blame.
They are benighted because of their stupidity.
You have no sins. Is it because you are ignorant?
I do have sins. O God, forgive me and humble me.
The Last Judgment is coming.
We will all burn out like candles.
And lay the blame at each other's door.
And try to embellish ourselves before the Almighty.
How can you paint being in this frame of mind?
And you accept praises.
I'd have taken the vows of schema and live in a cave.
I serve God, not men.
They praise you today and vilify tomorrow.
The next day they'll forget why they praised you.
They'll forget you and me - everything.
Everything is vanity and decay.
All follies and vile deeds were committed in the past and men are only repeating them now.
If Jesus came again, they would crucify him again.
If you only remember evil things you will never be happy before God.
Maybe you should forget some things, not all.
I don't know how to say it.
Don't say it then.
Listen to me.
Do you think you can do good single-handed?
Do good? Do you remember the New Testament?
Jesus collected men in temples and taught them.
Later they came to kill him.
"Crucify him!" they cried.
And His disciples?
Judas betrayed Him,
Peter denied Him.
They all fled. And they were the best of the best.
But they repented.
Yes, when it was too late.
Sadly, men do evil things.
Judas sold Christ.
And who bought Him?
The people?
Pharisees and scribes.
A witness was never found, try as they would.
And who could slander the innocent?
The crafty Pharisees were old hands at bluffing.
They had learned to read and write and used the people's ignorance to advantage.
People should be reminded that they are human beings that Russian people are of one blood and one land.
Evil is everywhere around.
And there are always those who would sell you for 30 coins.
New and new trials are heaping on the Russian men --
Tatars, famine, pestilence.
But they keep on working.
And carrying their cross humbly...
They never despair but resign themselves to their fate only praying to God to give them strength.
Won't the Most High forgive them their ignorance?
You know it...
Something goes wrong or you get tired, and then you meet somebody's eyes and feel like you have received communion, and feel better.
Is that not true?
Jesus may have been born and crucified to reconcile God with man.
Jesus came from God, so He is almighty.
He died on the cross - it was predestined.
His crucifixion and death were God's deed.
It had to arouse the hatred not of those who crucified Him, but of those who loved Him.
They loved Him as a man but He, of his own will, forsook them showing injustice or even cruelty.
Do you know what you are saying?
You may be banished to the north to restore icons.
Am I not right?
Don't you always speak your mind?
I do. For I'm a layman, a free man.
FESTIVITY. 1408
Over here, Sergius.
Right. You make the fire.
Thomas, let's pick some firewood.
Peter hasn't seen the Assumption or St. Dmitry cathedrals.
When he climbs scaffolding, and daubs a little, he'll know what this is about.
We won't make it before wintertime.
June is around the corner.
What's with you?
Hold it.
- Nightingales.
- Nothing more?
Listen.
- What's that?
- Come, come.
Witches' sabbath.
Where are you going?
- Come to me.
- Wait.
I see a black rascal, like, hiding.
Those God's servants.
They are so nosey.
Let me go.
We will, first thing in the morning.
And now we'll put a boulder on your neck to help you reach your destination.
Fire will come from heavens and will burn you.
The Last Judgment will come.
Now we'll attach you to this cross-piece like Jesus Christ.
Please don't.
You can't do this to me.
It's a sin.
Tie me head down if you must.
Let him hang.
Let him stay for the night, unless he rises.
Why head down?
It would've been quite bad.
Why'd you abuse us?
Threatened to burn us with fire?
It's a sin to walk around naked and all that.
This is the night when everybody must love.
Is love a sin?
Do you call it love tying a man?
What if you would bring bodyguards or monks to convert us to your faith?
D'you think it's easy to live in fear?
You fear because you live without love or your love is sinful and bestial.
Instead of brotherly.
No matter. It's love.
Please untie me.
Where were you?
The dense thicket.
My body is all bruised.
But the locals don't mind.
They are used to it.
People live by habits.
I guess old folk don't even use their brains.
Their lives pass in the same old rut.
I suppose they like it when time drags on from dawn till dusk without end.
Look at you.
Scratched and bruised all over.
Aren't you ashamed of your learners?
- Couldn't you come earlier?
- No, I couldn't.
You sin, you repent, you pray.
Catch her!
Run, Martha!
Can't you catch the stinking guy?
What have you done?
The damned heathens don't believe in one God.
Don't look, Sergius.
You don't want to see this.
Your Prince won't last long and we'll live like we lived.
Help, Theodore!
Let me go.
Don't go. She'll drown you before you know it.
Martha, swim!
THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.
SUMMER, 1408
- Thomas!
- What do you want?
May I go take a dip?
- No way.
- It's hot.
It's not hot. Don't lie.
Let him go bathing.
All he wants is to bathe.
Hot indeed.
Okay, you want to take a swim, go and take a swim.
Come on, go. What are you waiting for?
- Where's Andrei?
- Out.
The thing is...
I mean...
I come to see the bishop...
The place is a perfect pandemonium.
The bishop, red in the face, is running around in his underwear.
"My patience is running out", he says.
Meaning you.
"Everything was set two months ago and those idlers have done nothing.
They demanded heaps of money and haven't moved a finger."
- Did you ask a lot?
- What are you talking about?
"I don't care if it's
Daniil Cherny or Andrei Rublev", he says.
Yeah, he said that and wrinkled his face.
"Yes, he is Rublev.
He is Andrei. So what?
I want the cathedral done by autumn!"
He sent a messenger to complain to the Grand Duke.
I think you should know.
- Where is Andrei?
- Gone again.
Why don't you start without him?
Don't laugh. There are many of you around here.
You can do it.
Many wits are better than one.
For shame, Andrei.
A messenger was sent to complain to the Prince.
Just say yes or no.
We fixed it in Moscow, discussed every detail.
The Grand Duke said it was good.
Now what is not clear?
Why are we arguing all the time?
Maybe I am old and out of my mind?
"The Day of Judgment."
Go and do it.
Shall we drop the whole thing?
Yes, let's drop it and go back home.
How will I look people in the face? I'll die of shame.
It's warm and dry and we are wasting our time.
We could've finished the dome and the pillars by now.
Could have done it vibrantly and beautifully.
We could've painted the sinners boiling in tar, so that it would make one's flesh creep.
I've contrived a demon...
Smoke from his nostrils...
Smoke is not the point.
- What is?
- I don't know.
I can't.
I can't paint this. I hate it.
Can you understand it?
I don't want to frighten people away.
Can't you see?
It's "The Day of Judgment"!
It is not my invention.
I can't.
Why didn't you say it in Moscow?
We shouldn't have agreed.
That's foul play.
I am what I am.
I quit. This work is not for me.
Thanks for your kindness, for your clips.
You've taught me some things,
I'm gonna do some real work,
I was asked to do a church in Pafnutievo.
Small honor, but for real.
It's "The Day of Judgment".
Who's coming with me?
All right, stay here but don't have regrets later.
Though I speak with the tongues of men and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass.
And though I have the gift of prophecy, and have all knowledge and all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity,
I am nothing.
And though I give away all my goods and I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not, vaunteth not itself... is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; believeth all things, hopeth all things.
Charity never faileth: but prophecies shall fail, and tongues shall cease, and knowledge shall vanish away.
For shame, Princess.
D'you think it's good?
It's a sin to splash milk.
It's bad.
- Why is it a sin?
- Because --
- Mop it up.
- It'll dry off itself.
Let's go for a walk to the river.
Let me go, do let me go.
Do you like it?
Couldn't be better.
Light and beautiful.
Light...
Get her out of here.
You've spoilt her.
No one can make you a better mansion than us.
Look at the colors.
And the carving.
Mitya here can carve without marking.
It comes naturally to him, like a bird's song.
Could be a bird's song, yes.
But you are a Grand Duke, aren't you?
Don't you like it?
It must be repainted, the walls and the ceiling.
But brighter and more powerfully.
- I've been doing this for 40 years.
- So use your skill to glorify the Grand Duke.
We will not alter a thing.
We have to do another job.
Your brother is waiting for us in Zvenigorod.
They've already brought stone.
It's good. Whiter than this one.
When your brother came here at Easter we made a deal.
"I give you a free hand, just make a super mansion for me."
So Zvenigorod will it be.
The Prince just froze still.
When I mentioned Zvenigorod?
He's afraid his brother will outdo him.
- Who did this?
- Me.
Why didn't you set it into the wall?
- Couldn't manage it.
- A fine beast...
It crumbles.
I told the Prince not to stint money on stone.
He's probably sorry now.
I would show him for stinting money.
Goat, look lively!
Where is Stepan?
- Where is Stepan heading to?
- Zvenigorod I guess.
Good.
I've soiled my hands.
- Is the stone better?
- Yes.
- Look, it's the lieutenant.
- What does he want here?
Hold it, foreman.
Hey, jerk, give him a hand.
Where's my whip?
- Nikolai!
- Mitya!
Has anybody seen my whip?
Gee, I have lost my whip.
Sergius, read the Scripture.
- What passage?
- Take your pick.
Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me and keep my ordinances.
But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ; the head of the woman is the man; the head of Christ is God.
Every man praying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.
Every woman that prayeth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head.
For that is even all one as if she were shaven.
For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn.
But if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn, let her be covered.
For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.
Neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for him.
For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head.
Neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman...
Go on.
For as the woman is of the man, even so as the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her.
Why did you stop? Read on.
It is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for--
Hey, Danila.
They are celebrating.
It's a holiday!
They are not sinners.
Nor is she, even if she doesn't wear a cover.
A sinner indeed.
Leave him alone. Let the servant of God repent.
ANDREI RUBLEV
Part Two
Raid. 1408
They are coming, Prince.
The Tatars are coming.
Squint-Eye, go muster the men.
You hear me?
I say, Prince!
Can this really be the ford?
It's rains. They caused floods.
We'll ride on then. Follow us.
We expected you yesterday.
I was passing by a small town and couldn't resist the temptation.
I am late, sorry.
Let's go. Keep to the left, it's shallow here.
You're not bluffing, are you?
I am not. Vladimir is okay.
The Grand Duke is in Lithuania.
I hear the Grand Duke has a son but you've set your sights on his throne.
Time will tell.
I see you want that throne very much.
Hey,
I said keep to the left.
Keep up with me, Prince.
You really care for your brother.
Such is our fate.
Did you try to make it up?
I didn't.
The Metropolitan said to swear in God's truth that we will live in peace and chime.
There comes the Grand Duke.
So my brother is here.
Vladimir is beautiful.
A big city.
Go.
Keep up with me, you cur, or I'll maim you.
Keep up with the Prince.
Forward! To the gates!
Tatars! Run for your life!
Run, run!
Get him, Thomas.
Why, folks, we are Russian too.
You Vladimir bastard!
Catch him! Get him!
Go round, you sheep's head.
You deaf? Go round!
What is that? The place is peopleless.
They all ran away.
Your bitch has grown up and forgotten me.
My good man, let me go.
Let me go!
Well, Prince...
No qualms about the cathedral?
Thieves!
Rascals! Skunks!
What's that wench doing here?
She's not a wench, she's the Virgin Mary.
The Mother of God.
And who's in the box?
Christ, her son.
How can she be a virgin if she has a son?
But then anything can happen in your Rus.
I wonder.
It hurts! Oh Christ, it hurts!
I am burning. It hurts!
I don't know where the gold is.
Perhaps your Tatars have stolen it.
They are all thieves.
Why don't you ask your men?
- Did he say?
- No.
Wait, I want to say something.
Look at them torturing an innocent
Orthodox Russian man.
Just look at it, Judas,
Tatar mug.
I am Russian.
I know you. You look like your brother.
You have sold out Rus.
Oh, it hurts.
I won't say...
Mark my words,
Tatars will never set feet on Russian soil.
I swear to God.
I'll kiss the cross.
Give me the cross.
Fine, you will have the cross.
If we have sinned
God will forgive us, for He is merciful.
O Lord, will you forgive me?
And you will all boil in boiling tar.
When you go, we will build it anew.
Your guts will burst in the blazing inferno.
What are you doing?
What have I done?
Bastards!
Theophanus, aren't you dead?
I had a dream of you suspended from a window head down and wagging your finger at me.
And I lie across a saddle and two Tatars are twisting my head.
And you are tapping your finger on the pane.
- I shouted to you.
- Shouted what?
What on earth is going on?
Murder, rape,
Russians and Tatars are plundering temples...
And you said--
I am worse off than you.
You are dead and I---
I'm dead, so what?
I've spent half of my life in darkness.
I worked for humans day and night...
But they are no humans.
You were right when you said it then.
I said all sorts of things then.
You are wrong now and I was wrong then.
But we have one faith, one land and one blood.
I remember a Tatar who said with a smile,
"You will cut each other's throats without our interference."
Isn't it a disgrace?
They killed everyone,
Sergius too.
I found him on such a day!
She is all I have now.
- I must go.
- Wait.
Please, don't go.
Do you feel bad or bored with me? I am sorry.
Let's sit and talk.
Let me tell you--
I know it all.
I'll never paint again.
- Why not?
- Nobody wants it.
Yes, your iconostasis was burnt.
And how many mine were?
In Pskov, in Novgorod, in Galich...
You are taking a great sin upon yourself.
I haven't told you the main thing.
I killed a man.
A Russian man.
I saw him dragging her--
Look at her.
Evil took human image for our sins.
God will forgive you of course, but you mustn't forgive yourself.
So live between forgiveness and your own torment.
As for your sin, the Scripture has it...
"Learn to do good, seek the truth, save the oppressed, protect an orphan.
Then come and we shall judge between you," said the Lord.
"If thine sins be purple,
I shall whiten them."
So I didn't forget.
I hope you'll feel better.
I know God is merciful,
He'll forgive.
I will make a vow of silence to God.
I have nothing more to say to men.
Do you think it's a good idea?
Who am I to give you counsel?
Aren't you in Eden?
Here it's not the way you think.
Rus. Dear Rus.
She can bear everything.
Everything.
How long will it be like that?
I can't say. Always I reckon.
Ah, how beautiful it is.
It is snowing.
There is nothing more terrible than snow in a temple, is there?
SILENCE. 1412
The apples are rotten.
I haven't seen the likes of such famine in my whole life.
We are dying out.
The area looks deserted.
So do the villages.
Khotkovo people left their villages.
Semenovka folks too.
Not a soul in Semenovka.
Three years of bad harvest in Vladimir.
Many fled.
Those who survived eat rats and mice.
I spent the night in the lake and caught cold.
Wolves were after me, so I walked into the lake and prayed to God they didn't reach me.
I stood there all night, that's why I can't speak now.
- You come from Vladimir?
- I lived there...
Here's another guy from Vladimir.
He never opened his mouth.
Gave a vow of silence.
He repents for his sins.
A God's fool is with him.
She's dumb.
So they both keep mum.
It's self-disgrace: he wants his sin to always be with him.
That's what I call a saint.
And his artel?
There's no more artel.
Some were killed by Tatars, others parted ways with him.
And Danila?
I hear he either went north or died.
So he quit his trade?
My, if it isn't Cyril.
Is that you, Cyril?
Now Methodius let in Tatars.
It's no good to eat dirty meat.
Don't turn me away.
There is no truth in the world.
I can't bear to sin every day, and one can't help sinning there.
Take my repentance, Father.
I know you have a glib tongue, but you won't move me to pity.
Father, if you only knew how much grief and evil
I suffered, you would have forgiven me.
And myself I will never forgive.
You are guilty before God, not before me.
You can stay.
To redeem your sins you will copy the Holy Scripture
15 times.
You can live in the late
Nicodimus' cell.
Thank you, O Lord.
Thank you, brethren.
Oh how good.
Thank you, Father.
Good Russian, she eats horse meat.
Come with me to the Horde, you'll be my wife.
I got seven wives but not one
Russian wife among them.
You will eat horse meat every day, drink koumiss and wear coins in your hair.
Bend your head.
A Tatar husband's wife will never go unwashed.
Come with me, girl.
Come. Gimme your hand.
Andrei.
Do you recognize me?
Don't worry. They'll just take her for a ride and let go.
They won't dare to hurt a God's fool, it's a sin.
Bell. 1423
Is that Nikola the Caster's home?
Yes.
- Is he your father?
- Yes.
Is he home?
No, he isn't.
He's dead.
Plague took them all - mother, sister, father.
What about Gavrila who lives next door?
Gavrila is dead also.
Kasyan too.
Tatars took away Ivan.
Only Theodore is left.
You can see him but make haste.
He's so weak, he can't even open his eyes.
Looks like he is dying.
I refuse to go further.
It's useless.
- Let's go back home.
- Get up you.
How d'you like that!
He wants to go home!
My God, there is no one to cast a bell.
Take me with you.
I'll make you a bell.
Please. I can do this job for the Prince.
They are all dead, you won't find one better than me.
- Lay off.
- You'll regret it.
I know a bell secret.
But I won't tell you.
Father knew the secret of bell copper.
No one else knows it.
Only me. I know.
Father told me the secret before he died.
- Do we take him?
- He's a liar.
The Prince will have us flogged to death.
- He lied about the secret.
- Well, the worse for him.
Hey, come over here.
Climb up.
- What about my hut?
- Sit still.
Well, is it a deal?
What are we looking for?
We can dig nearby.
Here?
Closer to the belfry, to avoid long trips with heavy loads.
Can't we dig here?
Right here.
Start marking up.
Let's get down to it.
We are not diggers, we are casters.
Why should we dig?
Do you know what Dad told me before he died?
"The casters must dig a pit themselves.
I realized this only when I grew old."
He said this - and died.
Say what he would,
I am not going to dig.
Call us when you need us.
Well, have you found it?
There was no need to.
Here it is.
No.
It's not the clay.
- We always used it.
- It was a mistake.
- Is it really not good?
- Really.
Hear that?
We are going to look for it till we find the good stuff.
D'you think we should keep trying?
I think not. We got good clay.
Had trouble finding a new place and you--
It's bad, don't you see.
It's the end of August and no clay.
I feel pity for you.
I don't need your pity.
Come, Boris, dear.
No. It's the wrong clay.
- What is the right clay?
- I'll know it when I see it.
I don't need the likes of you.
I can do without you.
I don't want you.
I found it!
Uncle Peter, I found it!
Clay! Hey, Uncle Simeon!
Clay! Hey, Stepan!
Where are you?
- Shall we embed it?
- Wait, I am coming.
- Where is Nikolai?
- He went for timber.
It should have been here already.
- Nikolai left in the morning.
- Silly guy.
Why are you standing idly?
Get to work.
The merchants charged an exorbitant price for the cord and said it's dirt cheap.
- Do we buy it?
- We do.
The Prince will kill you.
I couldn't care less.
Step aside, Father, you may be hurt by accident.
Don't do it without me.
Yes.
Well, what is it?
The mould will not hold.
Put more armor on it.
We would coat it with clay if you've made the frame.
It needs armoring.
Dress it and start roasting by dusk.
If the mould is not armored properly it will not endure the copper and crack.
If we don't start roasting before snowtime
- I'll be flogged to death.
- The mould will give way here.
Fix the mould.
Do you hear me?
No.
Get out then.
Andrei, you do it.
He will not do it either.
- Will you fix it?
- It'll not hold.
You obey me.
Who is in charge here?
Put on one more layer.
Whip this one.
He won't do his work, nor obey me.
I am in charge here.
Your father did not treat us like that.
All right, you'll be flogged in his name.
Finish without me.
- Why aren't you embedding it?
- We are waiting for you.
Do it, just do it.
Go have some sleep.
Why are you looking at me?
You lost your tongue or deaf?
Sorry for him, eh?
Go comfort him.
You're a monk after all.
Boris, wake up.
I've started roasting.
Why didn't you wait for me?
I told you to wake me up.
I know when to start.
The Prince's messenger wants to see you.
Is it hot here.
You've got enough silver.
No.
Tell the Prince not to be stingy.
Our Prince is never stingy.
We need eight kilos more.
Who is it that knows the secret of bell copper, you or me?
Tell the Prince not to be stingy.
I'm going to shake the Prince out of lots of silver coins.
But the bell will never chime.
I know the monk.
Give it to him everybody.
Why bounce on a man without rhime or reason?
You've took him for someone else.
No, I didn't. I know him only too well.
He's shabby now, but he was sleek and well-nourished.
I sat in the pit for ten years because of him.
They chopped off half of my tongue.
Let go. Let go of me.
I'll kill you.
He's not guilty.
He didn't let down anyone,
I swear.
Beat me, not him.
Get up.
Hey, stand up.
You are heavy.
The Prince's fool has died.
He asked me to entertain him.
But I want nothing with Princes.
I'd rather work as a joiner.
And this guy I do know.
He sold me out all right.
Gimme a drink.
More is coming.
Haul it off.
Take a sample.
Go to the third kiln.
Do we throw more wood to the fire?
Don't stand, get busy, go to the third kiln.
Move it.
What about the second kiln?
More wood.
- Where is Boris?
- At the foundry.
The second and third kiln, ready.
Come, all is set.
Open it.
We are ready. Shall we start?
Go!
Pour it.
Here it goes.
Look at this.
God, help me and save me.
We're in for a hot day tomorrow.
We need a nap now.
- Shall we, Boris?
- Yes, in a sec.
Here is my story, Andrei.
I wasn't sure if I should tell you.
I always envied you, and how.
Like I was poisoned inside and consumed by envy.
I couldn't bear it and I left, because of you.
When I learned you quit daubing,
I felt a lot easier.
I wish I could copy the Holy Scripture.
The Father Superior gave me a hard penance in my old age.
I guess I won't make it.
Why am I confessing to you?
You are a great sinner yourself.
I'm but a worthless worm,
I'm not cast in the same mould.
But you...
For what holy deeds did God bless you with talent?
Forget it. I hear
Nikon has sent messengers asking you to do the Trinity and you sent them back.
And in my sinful heart a small joy arose.
My life is drawing to an end and my soul is craving peace.
True, Nikon wants you there to boost his authority using your talent.
But Nikon doesn't count.
Go and do the Trinity.
It's a sin not to use God's gift.
If Theophanus were alive he'd have said the same.
Look at me, a talentless man.
I am back for my daily bread, and to end my days in peace.
I die and nothing is left after me.
You won't live long either you know.
Do you want to take your talent to the grave?
Come on, say something.
As for the skomorokh...
It was me.
Curse me but open your mouth.
- It may give way.
- No.
Ready?
Here we go.
Leave everybody.
- How are you doing?
- All set.
Everybody goes up fast.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Go.
Take the ropes.
Mind the ends.
Wave your hand.
Go.
- Who is it?
- The Grand Duke.
- And who's with him?
- Aliens.
Oh what a day!
The Grand Duke is with a foreign ambassador.
Will you make it? You dare.
I bless and sanctify this bell with this holy water.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
They run the whole show.
Where are you going?
Do it, you dumbhead.
Shall I give you a hand or will you manage?
Don't.
That old brute of mine never told me the secret.
Never shared it with me.
Took it to his grave.
You've done a good job of it.
Why are you crying?
Let's work together.
You'll be casting bells and
I'll be painting icons.
Let's go to the Trinity.
It's a holiday for folks.
You've made a beautiful bell.
Why are you crying?
Come, come...
Come on, stop crying.
Calm down.

...things, I heard, as it were,
...the voice of much people in heaven saying,
..."Alleluia."
"Salvation and glory and power is to our God."
"For true and just are his judgments..."
"...who hath judged the great harlot which corrup..."
"...with her fornication..."
"...and hath revenged the blood of his servants at her hands."
And again...
Come, gather yourselves together to the great supper of God.
That you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of tribunes...
...and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses...
...and of them that sit on them...
...and the flesh of all freemen and bondmen...
...and of little and of great.
And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth...
...and their armies gathered together to make war with him...
...that sat upon the horse...
Bring on some water!
...army, and the beast was taken...
...and with him the false prophet...
...who wrought signs before him,
...wherewith he seduced them...
...who received the character of the beast...
...and who adored his image.
These two were cast alive into the pool of fire...
...burning with brimstone.
And the rest were slain by the sword of him that sitteth upon the horse,
...and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
The year is 1645.
England is in the grip of bloody civil war.
On the one side stand
<the Royalist party of King Charles,
...on the other, Cromwell's parliamentary party, the Roundheads.
The structure of law and order has collapsed.
Local magistrates indulge their individual whims.
Justice and injustice are dispensed in more or less equal quantities...
...and without opposition...
...an atmosphere in which the unscrupulous revel...
...and the likes of Matthew Hopkins take full advantage of the situation.
In a time where the superstitions of country folk...
...are still a powerful factor,
...Hopkins preys upon them,
...torturing and killing in a supposed drive...
...to eliminate witchcraft from the country...
...and doing so with the full blessing of what law there is.
However, his influence is confined...
...largely to the eastern sector of the country, East Anglia,
...which is held firmly in Cromwell's grasp...
...but not so firmly that the
Roundhead cavalry patrols...
...have everything their own way,
...for there still exists an ever-present threat...
...from the remnants of the Royalist armies,
...desperately foraging for food, horses, and supplies.
Stop that, Richard.
What?
What you're thinking.
What am I thinking?
Ungodly thoughts of your Sara, that's my guess.
Thoughts of Sara, yes.
Ungodly?
Depends on how you look at it.
And you, a supporter of Cromwell...
Hold your talking, you two.
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.
We'll be stopping in a few minutes to give the horses a rest.
You can gabble all you want then.
Fifteen minutes and we'll be on our way again.
Get down!
Royalist snipers.
Probably only a few of 'em after food and horses.
We'll flush the bastards out in no time.
Marshall, you scout behind to keep an eye on the nags,
...and the rest of you follow me and keep spread out.
Captain, look! There's one!
I see him! Follow!
Harcourt, this way.
Robert?
Captain?
Captain Gordon, is that you?
We're here, Trooper Marshall.
It's quite all right.
- Getting a bit nervous, were you, lad?
- Aye, just a bit, sir.
Well, no need to worry.
We got 'em all, I reckon.
Not quite all.
One of them got away, sir, though I put my sword in him first.
We'd better move on out of this wood, then.
If he has got away, he could still be dangerous.
Swallow, bury Brace's body as soon as you can.
Look out, sir!
Thank you, Trooper Marshall.
He was trying to kill you, sir.
I gathered that, Trooper.
It was a lucky shot, sir.
Yes.
Nevertheless, it could have ended my career for good.
Right, we move out.
Swallow, join us as soon as you've finished your business here.
Harcourt, give him a hand to remove the bodies.
Yes, sir.
So, you granted young Richard here leave, did you, Captain?
- I did.
- Aye, two days.
Then, you'll be away to see your girl,
I suppose.
And how will she greet you?
Just promoted cornet for killing king's men.
She knows my reason for fighting, and it's only while the trouble lasts.
What are you laughing at?
Leave him be, Robert.
Can't you see he's in love?
Aye, I'm not ashamed of it, either.
A toast, lads, to the lovely women of Suffolk.
And may they keep their beds warm for General Cromwell's gallant men.
Come on, boy.
Nearly home.
Well!
Master Marshall, welcome.
I trust you're well, sir.
My body is as strong as ever, but..
The war continues?
Aye, we still fight.
And why...
Well, my company's recruiting.
I have two days leave.
Then, you must eat with us this evening.
I thank you, sir.
We still have good food for all you soldiers take it from us.
And ale.
Come, we shall drink together.
After your experience,
...it is likely our village has grown a little smaller for you, eh, Richard?
Not so much smaller as lacking in promise, perhaps.
In Ipswich or Cambridge, a man might find better opportunities.
Richard, if you took Sara to wife...
You mean, you'd give us your blessing?
You would take her away from here?
You honor me, sir,
...but I only have a small farm that belonged to my father...
...and my soldier's pay, which is far from...
I am little concerned with your ill-kept lands.
And still less for the silver you get for killing good Christians.
Well, forgive me.
That was unjust.
But there is trouble coming to this village,
...and I want Sara far away before it arrives.
Surely Suffolk should be free from the king's armies.
It's not only the king's armies which bring death this year.
A lack of order in the land encourages strange ideas.
You mean more rebellion?
I'm sorry.
You have worries enough already.
But give me your word that you will soon take Sara away from here...
...and you shall ask her consent tonight.
You have my word on that, sir.
Good, Richard. Good.
That's right, my dear,
Master Richard Marshall.
Farm boy into soldier.
Welcome back, Master Marshall.
I'm glad to be back, Mistress Sara.
By the way, Sara,
I expect the meal at the usual time.
Yes, Uncle.
Your uncle has agreed to our marriage.
Oh, Richard!
The army has taught you rough manners.
Sara, why is he frightened?
There have been threats to us since you were last here.
Threats? Why?
We've been called Papists and idolaters,
...and filth chalked up on the walls.
They say we are king's creatures and should be pilloried and worse.
Who says these things?
We've become outcasts in our own village.
Rest easy.
Now, no one shall harm you.
I put my oath to that.
And have you arranged a day for the wedding, Richard?
No, sir.
Much depends on how the armies move.
Ah. Remember, it must be soon.
But how certain are your fears of this danger?
Perhaps just an old man's bad dream,
...and being an old man,
I must early to my bed.
Good night, my dear.
Good night, Uncle.
Oh, and Sara, remember to see the doors are well bolted.
Yes, Uncle.
And, Richard, don't keep Mistress Sara up too late.
Country women need full eight hours in their beds...
...if they're to be proper wives and mothers.
Good night, Cornet.
Good night, sir.
And will you make a proper wife and mother, Sara?
I still have much to learn, Richard.
I'll teach you.
Now... didn't your uncle just say you must early to bed?
- He did.
- And isn't he a wise man?
- He is.
- Right.
How much further, Matthew?
You'll not call me Matthew.
I'm not one of your drinking cronies...
...carousing and wenching in the taverns.
Aye, you're not that, sir.
Remember, John Stearne, you ride with me...
...only because you help me in my work.
You call it work?
It's the Lord's work, a noble thing.
And a profitable one.
The Good Lord paying in silver for every hanging.
That is blasphemy, Stearne.
Hold your tongue.
I'm merely an honest man who helps you get your confessions.
The law has prescribed due methods of interrogation.
And I have been blessed with the skills to carry them out.
Oh, stop your gabbling.
We have work to do in Brandeston.
Who is it this time?
- The message tells of a priest.
- A priest?
One who gives worship to Satan and calls him Lord.
Mm, with the priest himself a witch,
...there'll be others corrupted, too,
I'm thinking.
You enjoy torture, don't you, Stearne.
And you... sir?
Good-bye, sir.
God be with you, Richard.
Good-bye, Richard.
Good-bye, Sara.
I'll see you again soon.
Given up ale for stargazing,
Tom Salter?
Not stargazing, Master Marshall.
Waiting.
What for?
Matthew Hopkins, a lawyer.
Must be important, that you wait after dark.
It is that.
Aye.
Well, if I see a lawyer on the road,
I'll tell him you're here.
Hup.
How far is it to Brandeston, friend?
- About three miles.
- Thank you.
- Are you the lawyer?
- Aye.
- Name of Hopkins?
- Aye, Matthew Hopkins.
And this is my assistant
John Stearne.
Why do you want to know, soldier?
There are some men from the village back there waiting for you.
Aye, they sent for us.
What would a lawyer want in Brandeston?
A man who may not be what he seems to be.
Come, Stearne.
- John Lowes is his name.
- An evil man.
- A Papist.
- Yeah, burning candles and all.
That is no proof of witchcraft in itself.
Dressed himself in devil's garments, he did.
- And made unholy signs.
- Aye, he did. I saw him.
I will find out the truth for you.
Have no fear, friends.
Yes?
John Lowes?
So, it has come to this.
You accuse me, a priest, of working with the devil.
We can only judge by the evidence.
And there's a lot of that, old man.
I reject your accusations totally.
He's gonna give us trouble.
A simple confession, priest, that's all we ask.
Help us.
We've got a lot of work to do in Brandeston.
Leave my house, the pair of you!
I told you he was going to be difficult.
I reject your foul suggestions.
Leave here at once!
All you reject is the true God!
Take him, Stearne.
- Look for the devil's marks upon him.
- Right.
Help us, you two.
Look, he still prays to Satan.
Get on with your task.
If the devil made you a priest,
...he's gonna have hidden his mark with a lot of care.
To what purpose is this?
When the devil buys a soul,
...he marks the person's flesh so we will know him.
If such a mark is pricked, no blood will flow nor pain be felt.
Mistress Sara! Mistress Sara!
They've come for him!
They've come for the old man!
Quick! Hurry!
Seems Satan has hidden his mark well, Matthew.
Set him to running.
Quick, then, you two, around the table.
And keep him moving.
You would be his niece.
- Your name, child?
- Sara.
I am Matthew Hopkins, witchfinder.
Being his niece, you, too, may be corrupted by Satan.
No, not his niece.
A foundling taken in by him and his housekeeper.
- Are you telling me the truth, child?
- Yes, yes, of course.
When she died, I became his servant.
And you've remained innocent all of these years?
Yes, sir, entirely.
I trust you know the old man.
Better than anyone.
In private talk, we may shed some light on his innocence.
Private?
Yes, away from the distraction of the crowds.
Perhaps in the quiet of your room tonight...
...you might be able to help me prove him guiltless.
Would you release him now?
You might be convinced tonight that this is all needless.
And you will make every effort to present the facts to me?
You may come to my room tonight, sir.
At what hour?
At 8:00.
If you'll release him now.
All right.
He can sleep in the jail, and we'll be rid of him.
Come on!
Get up, you Papist bastard!
Has he confessed yet?
Not a word.
Well, then, stop this.
But he hasn't confessed.
Take him to the jail.
We'll continue the interrogation tomorrow.
Jail...
You heard what he said.
Quiet down, you animal.
You know what, Marston?
There were these couple of right filthy girls.
Filthy they were!
Horrible to behold. Horrible!
- Witches?
- Yeah, both of them.
We hanged them, Matthew and me.
Matthew. You know Matthew.
He's my partner.
Did it take you long to get a confession out of them, John?
Well, a couple of days with one of them.
- The other one...
- Do you want more ale, sir?
Yeah...
Go on, then. Come on.
What about the other one?
- Tell us about her.
- Oh, yeah, the other one.
Now, she was a real strange one, she was.
Loved us for it, like she wanted to get strung up.
Reckon that was the only bit of excitement she ever had.
Well, go on, then, Mr. Stearne.
Go on.
Filthy...
Sara, I've come to question you.
You came here for a purpose, sir.
I came here to get your evidence about the priest.
He's been kind to me.
Perhaps he had a motive.
Men sometimes have strange motives for the things they do.
I know.
My motive in coming here was to... find the truth.
How about the priest,
Master Hopkins?
We'll have done with him in a day or two.
Have no fear, child.
- He's been good to me in his way.
- He is an idolater.
He must confess and die.
Stearne will see to that.
Oh, no, please!
Don't let him be harmed, please!
You seek to protect a witch from rightful justice?
Oh, no, not that, but couldn't he be kept in a cell?
He could do no harm from a prison cell.
- Oh, please!
- But justice must be done, my dear.
Grant me this.
Please, Matthew.
Past noon, you unkempt lout.
Get up!
Get away!
I need air.
Where's the priest?
Where you put him, in the jail.
We'll, uh, get him out and start questioning him, then, eh?
- No.
- What?
- He stays where he is.
- But we have no confession at all.
I said we'll leave him in the cell.
All right, then. All right.
Um, what about the women?
When are we gonna start interrogating them?
I hear tell they've a good few witches around this place.
When you're in fit condition.
I'm fighting-fit as it is.
Oh, and where were you last night,
Matthew?
- I hear tell you've been a-wandering.
- You hear tell too much, man.
You there. Old man.
Master Hopkins, the witchfinder,
...he says you're to be kept here, interrogated no further.
Where are you off to, John?
I'm going for a walk.
By myself.
Tell me!
Tell me!
Tell me!
Tell me that!
Come on. Tell me!
Confess, witch!
Tell us your foul iniquities!
No!
Your familiars, woman.
Confess!
Stop.
Stop.
For God's sake, stop.
Quiet, old man, and be thankful you're not getting the same.
Tell me when I ask you!
How many of them?
A dog? A ferret?
Come on. Tell me!
John.
The witchfinder, he's coming.
I trust you are using the prescribed methods, Stearne.
Naturally.
Has she confessed?
Well, give me time.
She's only been here an hour.
Continue with the interrogation.
I shall be gone for a while.
You're always going off somewhere... sir, aren't you?
What do you mean?
Nothing.
I've been called over the hill to the next village.
I shall be back by tomorrow.
You will remain in charge here.
Carry on your work while you're away, aye, sir?
Indeed.
And the priest?
I said to leave him be.
What do you want?
You.
Where's Master Hopkins?
Gone.
Gone?
- Where?
- Just gone.
He's left me in charge.
No!
Help me!
Help me.
No!
And don't think I don't know why the old priest is being spared, eh?
Stearne, the priest,
I've changed my mind.
Confess!
Confess.
He confessed.
You heard him.
I've heard nothing yet,
Master Hopkins.
Refresh Master Salter's memory,
Stearne.
You heard him.
You did, too.
Yes, Master Hopkins.
Witnesses.
Get up, you blasted witch! Get up!
Come on!
You are, all of you, confessed idolaters.
However, these proceedings shall be carried out...
...through due process of law.
What law demands, we shall satisfy.
You will each be tied in a prescribed fashion...
...and cast into the moat.
Should you then sink,
...we will know that your confessions are false.
If, on the other hand, you are seen to swim or float,
...then your confessions of witchcraft are proven beyond a doubt...
...in the sight of God,
...and you will be withdrawn from the water...
...and hanged by the neck until you are dead.
You can't hang me!
The law forbids it! I'm with child!
And who would want to make you pregnant, witch?
Quiet.
Stearne, go on with your task.
Oh, God, help me!
Help me!
Help.
Hey, look!
One of them's gone already.
They swim.
The mark of Satan is upon them.
Give us a hand here! Come on!
They must hang.
She was innocent.
God forgive you, Matthew Hopkins.
Jailer...
...take them to the tree.
The money from the magistrate, nine guineas in silver.
Good. Now we can leave.
- Good morning, soldier.
- Good morning.
What'll you be after in the way of horses, then, aye?
A dozen or so for General Cromwell's armies up north.
Well, lost a few, have you?
Aye, at Cheriton Wood.
That's a pretty sorry looking bunch of old nags you got in there, friend.
The best we could find.
Then, they'll have to do.
- A dozen you say, eh?
- Aye.
We'll be back in Suffolk soon,
...where, thank God, they still breed strong horses.
Oh, I doubt you'll find much better there.
I'm just back from those parts.
The mounts up there are much like these.
Have you been through Brandeston at all, man?
Brandeston? Aye.
And a fine commotion they're stirring up there.
What, over you taking their horses?
No, nothing like that.
- A mass hanging.
- Who?
Witches, I heard.
Two women and a priest.
Where was the priest from, man?
Brandeston, I suppose.
A brave old boy for all his white hairs.
Was he a friend of yours?
Two troopers, Gifford and Harcourt, will be here directly.
Have 'em take these horses here back to the regiment...
...and report that I'm delayed.
I'll join them further north.
Do you understand?
Yes, but where will you be going to?
Maybe not.
Sara!
Sara?
Sara!
Sara.
Sara!
Sara!
Sara!
They took him and killed him.
They said he was an idolater.
I know. I heard.
- Sara...
- One of them... the witchfinder...
...he...
...he...
I didn't want to...
I thought I could save him.
I thought they'd have pity.
We kneel before thee, oh, Lord, in humility...
...to ask for a blessing on our union.
We ask for forgiveness of our sins...
...and strength to lead righteous lives as man and wife.
We pray, also, for the soul of thy servant, John Lowes.
May he know eternal peace.
And it is in thy sight, oh, Lord, that I hereby swear...
...I shall not rest from the pursuit of his murderers...
...till they stand before thee ready to answer to thee for their sins.
Take this money and whatever you need from the rectory...
...and go to Lavenham.
- You'll be safer there.
- I will, Richard.
Find lodgings and stay there.
I'll come to you.
I love you very much.
Oh, Richard!
Shepherd, I seek two men.
Witchfinders, they call themselves.
They were said to be headed this way.
- Matthew Hopkins and his assistant?
- Aye.
I've heard they're in Hoxne, about four miles yonder,
...but I can't be sure.
Thank you, shepherd.
Get out!
Oh, come on, Johnny, give us a kiss.
Oh, get away from me.
Oh, stop it, you dirty rascal!
Stop it!
Here, I'll bet you two pennies.
Get another drink.
Go on, Johnny. Be a love.
- Ale, soldier?
- Aye, to wash the dust from my throat.
- Another one for you?
- Aye, get a move on with it.
She's got a powerful thirst still.
Landlord, I'm looking for a man called Hopkins.
- I heard he was coming this way.
- Matthew Hopkins?
Would you know where he is, friend?
Aye, he's gone to Cambridge today.
But you got an accusation to make,
I'll get your confession for you.
I do the pricking, you know, not Matthew.
...I'm your man, friend.
John Stearne, they call me.
I'm husband to Sara Lowes.
You all right, friend?
Yeah.
You better get out of here.
Yeah, I'm going. Don't worry.
As for you, soldier,
...you're coming down to see the magistrate.
Am I?
Not with you!
Quick, Matthew!
For God's sake, Stearne, what have you done?
- Who was that?
- Richard Marshall.
- Who?
- He's married to the girl... Sara.
- How did he find you?
- He was looking for you.
He found out about Brandeston.
We're going to have to separate.
I won't run from him.
We have work to do down south in Lavenham.
Not me. He's after our blood.
Seems to me he's already had some of yours.
Well, he's not gonna have any more, you understand?
You're forgetting our powers.
He could be a witch.
He's a man who's out to kill both of us.
Then, it appears to me...
...that we should take steps to see to his death first.
Come. We travel to Lavenham.
I full well understand your feelings, Cornet,
...but you're an officer of the army, a soldier,
...and desertion is punishable by death.
However, in this case, there are two factors...
...which will stay me from subjecting you to a full court-martial.
One, we are grouped here at Naseby...
...in preparation for a major assault on the Royalist armies.
We need every man we can get.
And you're a pretty good soldier most of the time.
Thank you, sir.
Secondly, I would sleep ill if I had to send to the gallows...
...a man who had saved my life.
But, Cornet, remember this.
If you should leave your command again,
...I will have no alternative...
...but to throw the whole weight of military law against you.
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.
Dismissed, Cornet.
And may God help you in your search,
Cornet Marshall.
Robert, hello.
- Richard, you're back.
- Aye.
What happened with the Captain?
Nothing.
I heard about Brandeston, Richard.
Hopkins and Stearne.
I'll find them somewhere.
But what can you do?
What proof have you that they committed any crime?
I got Sara's word on it.
Is that enough for the magistrates?
There'll be no magistrates involved.
What do you mean?
We'll talk more later, Richard.
We must be on our way.
We're after horses for this skirmish that's coming up.
All right.
Hup. Come on. Hup.
Parliament men.
Comrades of friend Marshall.
There's some good ones coming now.
Look.
Hey!
Let's make a run for it, shall we, while we can.
Be calm.
Yeah, but if they find out who we are, they'll...
They won't. Come on.
That's a fine horse you've got there, friend.
The army needs mounts of such caliber.
I am not selling.
But you will get your money when the war's over.
You don't appear to understand.
I am not selling.
Oh, but you are selling, friend.
And we'll take that one, there, too.
So you filthy soldiers can butcher my mare?
Sergeant, he thinks we're filthy soldiers.
- Do you hear?
- Aye, I heard.
You can't go saying things like that, friend.
What he needs is a little army discipline.
I hear you need more pikemen in your platoon, Sergeant.
You'll pay for this!
Hey!
Good horse you had there.
Cost a pretty penny, I reckon.
We robbed the county mint.
Ah, right jester, he is.
Yeah, well, a day's fighting in Cromwell's army will soon cure your wit, my lad.
I am not doing any fighting, neither for the king or your precious Cromwell, either.
- You mark that well, soldier.
- Yeah, you coward.
Just like your friend.
- Matthew Hopkins is no friend of mine.
- Hopkins?
The fancy boy who just made a fool of your cavalry, comrade.
- You rode with him.
- I had reasons.
- Ah, he pays you?
- We were partners.
- In what business?
- Extermination.
- Eh?
- And what does that mean?
Now...
Matthew Hopkins, sir.
Adequate, very adequate.
We did our best, sir.
Lavenham has served me well,
Master Webb.
Now I must find out how I can serve you.
They're all women, sir.
Strange, isn't it, how much iniquity the Lord vested in the female?
Pardon, sir?
Who makes the accusations?
Myself, sir.
I'm representing the town.
- How many?
- Three, sir.
And what age?
Well, two are young, sir...
Elizabeth Clark and Mary Reynolds.
The other's worn and old.
Mm. Fetch the young pair here to me.
What of the other hag?
Oh, the old ones are more sensible.
It's the young ones who are stubborn.
They require time.
Oh, I see.
- Um, sir?
- Yes, man?
Your assistant, sir...
We were told he, too, would be coming to Lavenham.
He's engaged elsewhere.
He's fighting for the Parliamentary cause.
Oh. He will be joining you here, sir?
I really can't say.
You can manage without him?
Of course.
- I apologize.
- No.
Not only can I manage without him,
...but I intend to instigate a new method of execution,
...and you, Master Webb, you shall aid me in carrying it out.
What's that, sir?
You'll see.
It's a fitting end for the foul ungodliness in womankind.
Yes, sir.
Now fetch that young pair here.
Sir.
An excellent meal, gentlemen.
There is little I find so satisfying...
...as good food after a well-earned victory.
- Wouldn't you agree?
- Entirely, General.
The conflict at Naseby, sir,
...will go down as a triumph of your strategy.
Perhaps.
I would rather that it went down...
...as a triumph for the forces of true godliness.
Nevertheless, your name will symbolize the victory, sir.
Whether I like it or not, eh, Captain?
That cornet you so highly recommended to me,
...is he to join us?
- He's coming now, General Cromwell.
- Good.
Amongst the most pleasurable aspects of victory, gentlemen,
...is the opportunity it affords to reward valor.
It ranks almost with good food.
- Cornet Marshall, sir.
- Mm.
All right. Rest, Cornet.
Your captain has told me about you.
He says you're a good soldier.
Thank you, sir.
He recommends that I promote you to captain.
I thank you, sir.
I have a special mission for you,
Captain.
Take three men and ride back into East Anglia.
The king has escaped us...
...and is rumored to be making for the Norfolk coast.
If that is the case,
...find and apprehend him before he can escape to the continent.
It's an honor, sir.
Pick your men.
Start at once.
If you find the king, you will escort him then to Norwich.
If not, join us in the west.
Good luck, Captain.
Shall we rest up for the night,
Richard?
We got a job to do.
We'll go on till we've done it.
Do you mean looking for the king or finding Hopkins and Stearne?
Both.
Richard, you can't go off and desert again.
I don't plan to desert.
But supposing you do find out where they are?
Then I shall take temporary leave again.
For God's sake, Richard,
I know how you feel,
...but to risk court-martial to kill Parliament's own appointees,
...you'll be hanged yourself.
Robert...
I've taken an oath.
I won't break it.
- It's madness.
- It's justice.
It's my justice.
And what about one of them, sir?
You won't find better horseflesh in the whole of Suffolk.
So, how much are you gonna try to drag out of me if I take that one?
He's yours for a couple of guineas, sir.
A guinea.
A guinea and a half for getting me out of bed at this hour of the morning.
- One guinea.
- And a quarter?
I'll quarter you.
- Ah, you drive a hard bargain, sir.
- Yeah.
And where would you be heading that you need a horse in such a hurry?
- To find my partner.
- Your partner, eh?
And what line of business might you be in?
God's business... witch-finding.
Witch-finding. Oh, that's nice.
That's very nice.
You wouldn't make it a guinea and a quarter, would you?
Do you know a man called Matthew Hopkins?
You know where he is?
I heard tell of such a man down south.
Lavenham, I believe.
What's he doing in Lavenham?
Extracting confessions, I don't doubt.
You let me have that four-legged cripple now!
This happened three days ago.
Why didn't you report it to the militia then?
How should we know it was the king himself?
A stranger, obviously a townsman, tries to hire a boat to cross to France...
...and you suspect nothing?
When the country's torn by civil war?
I didn't know there was a war on till you gentlemen told me so.
Oh, come on, Richard.
We'd better go back.
Aye, I suppose so.
I want to pass through Lavenham, see how Sara is.
- Lavenham?
- Aye. How far is it from here?
About two days ride, I reckon.
They got more excitement over there than any of your city folk's wars.
- What do you mean?
- They're burning witches there, I hear.
Some such rigmarole.
They're in Lavenham!
Aye. Richard!
Elizabeth!
Elizabeth!
Oh, God.
- All is ready, Master Hopkins?
- Aye.
Proceed with the executions, then.
Bring forth Elizabeth Clark.
Right.
Siegel, fetch the rope.
Oh, come on, you little bitch!
No!
Hold still, will ya?
No!
All right, lower away.
Slowly, now. Keep her slow.
Elizabeth!
Master Hopkins, there are two more to be burned.
Yes, Magistrate.
Master Webb... the others.
Here you are, 12 guineas in silver.
To be spent in the service of our Lord, Magistrate.
We must thank you for your good work,
...Master Witchfinder.
Thank you, Magistrate, for your aid.
Leave 'em alone.
Don't want to buy? Move away.
Get out. Get out. Get out.
Witchfinder!
Greetings, Stearne.
Is that all you've got to say...
...after leaving me there with Cromwell's men?
Well, I provided us both with the opportunity to escape.
Only you did and I was captured.
Fortunes of war, Stearne.
You know me well enough...
...to know that I wouldn't hesitate to fire and kill you.
Aye, you would that.
I hold all human life dearly,
Stearne, especially my own.
Oh, come now.
You've escaped and all is well.
Maybe.
I even saved your share of the pay...
...even though I did all of the work myself.
Now, are you going to be sensible, or do I kill you?
By the way, do you know what they call me now?
What?
Witchfinder General.
There are those who think that I should be appointed such...
...for all of England,
...appointed by Parliament.
Here. Look.
Sara... she's here.
Very nice, eh, Matthew?
No, you fool.
Don't you realize that if she's here, that trooper must be around, too?
But he's away fighting.
Suppose he got leave after Naseby, where do you think he'd go?
To see her, of course.
- We better move along then, eh?
- No.
That man Marshall is not going to give up.
He's proved that to us already.
Then, we have to get him before he gets us, right?
We have the power to do it legally.
Prove him a witch, huh?
Exactly.
He'd never confess, not that one.
On his own, no.
But if we had him and the girl?
Yeah, she's the niece of a man we executed for witchcraft.
And Marshall is her husband.
I owe that jumped-up plowboy a seeing-to.
Go out and ask around.
Find out if he's been seen.
If not, we'll tarry here a while until he does arrive.
- Who is it?
- Sara, open the door. It's me.
Richard?
They were here...
Hopkins and Stearne.
I didn't know what to do.
I saw them in the street.
- I didn't know if they saw me or not.
- I know. I know.
Well... I'll be in the tavern with the others, then.
He's here, Matthew!
Just arrived.
- Where's he gone?
- To see the girl.
- Alone?
- Yeah.
The three others are in the tavern.
Go and get us an extra man to help.
Where are we gonna take them,
Matthew?
Up to the castle.
Magistrate here is very helpful.
That's where you interrogated the others, is it?
Yes.
Now hurry to it, man.
What are you going to do?
You say Hopkins arrived two days ago?
Yes, and then he was with the other one in... in the street today.
And they haven't left yet?
I'm not sure.
I've been too scared to leave.
Come on! Open up in there!
Drop that sword, soldier.
This man accuses you, Sara Lowes, and you, Richard Marshall,
...of consorting with the devil.
- Is that not so, Master Webb?
- It is that, sir.
Will you describe your evidence to us?
I observed the accused talking with their familiars...
...and making the signs of Satan, sir.
And what were these familiars to which you refer?
Black cat and a stoat, sir.
You're a very observant citizen,
Master Webb.
Well, Sara...
...do you confess?
And what do you have to say, soldier?
I'm gonna kill you, Hopkins.
I don't think you'll find that easy.
The law is with me, remember.
And what are you?
An accused witch.
They must be submitted to the test.
Take them, Stearne.
Hopkins!
A Royalist sympathizer, evidently.
But what are we gonna do with him?
Leave him.
I'll inform the magistrate later.
We have more important work to do.
Come on.
Get moving.
Orders from the magistrate.
Suspected witches.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
I heard them.
Where are they taking them?
To the castle to test them.
Test them?
They're accused...
...of witchcraft.
- Harcourt, you come with me.
- Yes, sir.
- Shall I look after him, sir?
- Yes. Try and find him a physician.
I've heard much of how Hopkins conducts his interrogations.
Come on, Harcourt.
All right, Stearne.
Well, Captain Marshall, do you now confess?
Keep at it, Stearne.
You're doing God's work.
Put her over here.
And you, Master Webb, help him.
Master Hopkins and his assistants, are they here, man?
- That they are, sir.
- Well, let us pass, then.
You're here to help the witchfinder?
We're here to find him, yes.
Have you a signed pass?
Sara...
...I'm going to place this iron on your back.
Should you faint or cry out,
...we can only take it that Satan has intervened...
...to... spare you your agony.
However, I could show mercy if...
...if Captain Marshall were to confess to witchcraft first.
But will you do it, sir?
I shall kill you.
So, you have no proper authorization, then.
What do you mean?
From the magistrate.
Authorization.
Not here with us, no.
Well, we'll go back and get one then.
All right.
Then I'll let you pass.
Master Webb, go and see what is the matter.
Yes, Master Hopkins.
What do we do, Matthew?
We shall carry on with God's work as before, man.
And fetch Captain Marshall over here.
He shall kneel before his wife and watch her suffer.
- But, Matthew...
- Go do it, man!
Oh, God!
You took him away from me.
You took him from me.
You took him from me.
You took him from me!
You took him from me!
May God have mercy on us all.
VALLEY OF THE BEES
May you have children within the year.
Ondøej!
Ondøej!
Everyone is looking for you Ondøej.
Come join us.
Look, this is your new mother.
Don't be afraid.
Come give her a kiss.
Have you brought a gift?
Present it.
Father...
Oh Lord, dont't let him die.
Merciful Virgin, he is yours,
I promise to dedicate him to Thee.
Save his life, and he will become
Thy servant.
Ondøej of Volfenberk,
Do you wish to take up the cross and follow me?
I do.
Do you surrender all your riches, in token, of your subjection to our Order?
I do.
Do you harden your heart, and never give in to temptation by woman, man, or your own body?
Yes.
I do.
Do you renounce your parents, and vow your life to the Heavenly Virgin alone?
I do, so help me God.
The power of the order, prevails over pride and malice.
Kneel, Ondøej of Volfenberk.
Look straight ahead.
Deus meus salvum, fac servuum tuum.
Rise brother, and follow me.
For I am Jesus, your light.
-Have you seen the sea before?
-No.
No until now.
I wish I could also see it again for the first time.
Taste it.
It's salty.
What is your name, brother?
Ondøej of Vlkov.
-And yours?
-Armin von Heide.
We shall be friends, Ondøej.
Years passed, and the Order became more powerful...
Further north lies Wenden.
Home to our most pious brethren.
They have taken a vow of silence.
Some even have themselves walled up alive.
Once I wanted to join them.
Hold out Ondøej! Take my hand!
You'll feel a chill, then comes the pain.
Your lower body, will be numbed.
But your spirit will rise, above your weakness, and human wretchedness.
What do you feel?
I'm cold.
Your hand feels as cold as it were lifeless.
Suffering is the way to God.
How far did you travel, Armin?
Enough! The fast has begun.
At one time I wanted...
I got as far as a plain covered with hot sand.
Far from here?
No one returned from here.
None of us saw the holly walls of Jerusalem.
The Great Commander died of plague near Acre.
We were tortured by the heat, the pagans, and the bleeding.
I'll never come back.
-God be with you noble brother.
-And with you, Sibold.
Some knights were mercenaries, and did't seek salvation.
Instead they sought beautiful women and riches.
They drunk their own urine in the desert, cursing God and their mothers.
Hear!
In the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
Be zealous in prayer, and in the defense of faith.
The great fast has begun.
I haven't seen brother Rotgier today.
Is he ill?
What happened, Ondøej?
I want to water my horse.
I'll catch up with you.
Do you see that forest?
-Rotgier?
-I need a horse, Ondøej.
-Everyone is looking for you.
-I know.
You must help me.
You must go back!
Where?
To those monks?
Be blinded by darkness?
And to die of eternal fasting?
Did you see that forest?
It's out of the Order's reach.
You're still there.
On this bank.
You have nowhere to go back to.
I own an estate in Harz.
It's in the valley near the source of five rivers.
You can come with me, brother.
Your horse can carry us both.
-I shall find you a wife from Thüringen.
-You're betraying Juses Christ!
As you wish.
Back!
What is the matter, Ondøej?
What happened?
Did that dog stab you?
No.
He didn't.
Where is your horse?
Get up!
Can you walk?
I don't want to punish you, but you may not leave your cell for the entire fast.
Ask God to forgive you your weakness.
You may pity your enemies, but you may not forgive traitorous brothers.
-Frater pro Deo...
-Be quiet, you dog!
You hurt your brother!
You know, what awaits you.
God forgive you your weakness.
Fair bride, give me to drink.
That is what it says there.
I can't read.
But I can read well.
Greek.
Latin.
German... What?
Do you also want a drink from the beautiful bride?
The fast has ended.
Look at yourself.
How ugly you are!
Be quiet!
How is he?
He refuses to eat. His cell has been unlocked at the evening.
Is he praying?
He was silent.
But when the hounds tore up that one,
I heard him laughing.
-He laughed?
-Yes, sir.
Ondøej!
I'll bring him back.
Come closer. release me, venerable brother Commander.
Come closer to the fire.
-You're soaking wet.
-Let me leave.
And don't lose faith in me, should I be delayed.
-Do you want to leave our territory?
-Yes I do.
All our actions are sinful, and always have been.
Our inherent weaknes, doesn't leave our bodies until they rot in the grave.
-We can't resist.
-It isn't for my own salvation.
He's gone astray, but his soul will return.
Hand me my cloak.
Why are your hands so cold?
Warm them at the fire before you serve me.
Why are you running away?
How do I get to Volfenberk?
-I've never heard of it.
-It's Vlkov in Czech.
I don't know that either.
-I am in Bohemia, aren't I?
-Yes, you are.
Yacho!
Yacho!
Come here, Yacho!
Leave him alone.
Who are you?
I can't see you.
Cover up, lass!
Yacho!
Yacho, help me!
I've never heard your footsteps.
You aren't farmer.
You walk softly, proudly.
Nor are you a merchant.
You would talk more.
-Where is everyone?
-Father is with the sheep.
The hunters won't be home until evening.
-Eat and drink and may God bless you.
-Thank you, lass.
What's the matter with you?
Are you blind?
Have you come from afar?
From the north, searching for my brother.
-What is this?
-Sheep's milk.
Haven't you drunk it before?
Aren't you afraid of strangers?
Why should I?
-I might know you by your hand.
-I can't touch you.
What if I touch you?
You would lose your hand.
Your voice sounds different now.
Why are you so quiet?
Talk to me.
-What does your mother call you?
-I have no mother.
-Do you have a father?
-I have no family.
I serve no mortal.
Then why are you looking for your brother?
-I'm blind, yet I see you.
-What do you see?
There is something in you which frightens me.
But it entices me too.
Be gone, lass!
I feel sorry for you.
God will forgive you, for you don't know what are you saying.
My Lord.
Come join us.
You haven't eaten yet.
We caught a deer.
Give me someting to drink.
Water!
Are you traveling alone?
Aren't you afraid?
The cross of my Order protects me.
Not in this country.
Who owns these forests?
I am a yeoman.
Are they yours, then?
A lynx killed this deer.
We save the carcass.
Someone must be in the pen.
Colliers.
My most distant neighbors.
May I bring them here?
What's new on your hill?
This morning we found blood in clearing.
We'd like to stay overnight.
You'll be safe here.
Did you lose your hand or what?
What are you afraid of?
He's trembling.
A stranger came to us at midday.
He was in rage, barefoot, clad only from the waist down.
-I thought...
-What did he want?
-We gave him some food...
-He asked where he could get a horse.
Where he could get one.
What's wrong with your hand?
I burned myself.
That's a wound from a knife.
Or a sword.
He was carrying a sword.
You waylaid him!
No.
We wanted the sword.
One like this?
Sir...
Are you awake?
Get up and come out.
I've brought you a horse.
Get up, Ondøej.
-We shall go.
-Where?
North.
You'll make a pilgrimage of penance.
I don't want to return, Armin.
We'll go together, Ondøej.
You belong to the Order!
My father vowed my life to the Order to save his soul.
Think of your own.
Don't worry about me.
You took the vow.
Casting away your cloak will not save you.
Enough talk.
My home isn't far.
I owe you something,
...for the horse.
Hands of him!
He is mine!
What belongs to you, sir?
Be gone!
I promised you would return.
I've been thirsty over since
I returned from the Holy Land.
Feels like I'm on fire.
Armin?
Open up!
I come unarmed.
These are hard times.
Someone may be after you.
Shut up and undo the chains!
I want to see the Lord of Vlkov!
Retrace your steps, and you'll find his grave.
What is it, Markvart?
Come up here!
You'll see him.
What do you want here?
I'm Ondøej.
Lady Lenora!
Lady Lenora!
Is it you?
God be with you, Jakub.
Won't you even embrace me?
Who is it, Jakub?
Lady... Rejoice!
Good Lord...
Come.
-Don't stand there.
-Leave me alone, mother.
I'm on the verge of tears.
Why this separate bowl?
Do I have mange, or what?
Why are yelling at us, Ondøej?
We haven't eaten meat since his death.
God have mercy.
God have mercy.
Jakub...
Close the gate and unleash the dogs.
We don't have dogs anymore.
Come to me in the morning.
What are you afraid of?
We always unleashed the dogs for the night.
In the north.
Do you sleep upstairs, mother?
The garret is vacant now.
Martin were nesting there.
We had to close the shutters.
You have changed.
You, as well, are no longer the same boy who left us.
Wait. I'll take you there.
You don't have to, mother.
On second thought, as you like.
Put this on. It's clean.
Help me.
It used to be full.
He saved every groschen, in order to buy you back.
Yet he did't want to break his promise to God.
-We are poor, Ondøej.
-Give me his sword.
I came here with empty hands.
I'm glad just to be alive.
Why are you closing your eyes?
Are you crying, Lena?
I know you're here.
Leave me here, and go.
I want to be alone.
Oh Lord, deliver us from the evil, that went into the grave.
May our grain prosper.
Don't let the werewolf poison our well.
Don't let the snake drink our cow's milk.
Let peace reign at Vlkov.
He used to sit here all day, waiting for you to return.
And during snowstorms, we had to ring the bell, so you wouldn't lose your way.
What do you see?
A beautiful day, my lord.
I hope it stays like this.
-Is the gate closed?
-I opened it for my lady.
She goes to mass every morning.
Don't open the gate for anybody without my consent.
Not even for anybody in distress.
Hana, don't sit there like a bump on a log!
Come, pour some water over me.
More!
More...
Bìtka, come here!
Come here!
Here.
Here is where it's burning.
More!
That will do.
Dry my off!
What a sad place. A courtyard should be full of children.
We'll never see that here.
Jakub!
Saddle my horse.
Look, my lord!
Let me see!
A shepherd gave me the cub.
He killed a she-wolf.
This one came looking for her.
I implored him.
-It's a wolf-cub?
-Yes, my lord.
-Do you know how to handle dogs?
-It isn't difficult, my lord.
Open the gate!
Who here owns pack of hounds?
-Hunting dogs?
-Now you resemble your father.
Am I about to die?
Eternal bliss be with you.
Do you want to see me?
I heard you had returned.
Nobody knows where you were.
I don't know you.
I'm father Blasius.
From the new church.
I can't shake hands with you.
-Don't they sting you?
-Yes, they do.
I get dozen of stings every day.
You get used to it.
-Are they stinging today?
-They can sense a storm coming.
It's hot indeed.
Your mother paid a visit today.
She confessed.
They say you entered an order near the sea.
That was long ago.
I fell ill there on the north.
I decided to return home if I got better.
You decided well.
Vlkov lacked a master, and our church needed donors.
-I shall not be ordered about.
-It was just a humble request.
Rather a plea.
Do you have any news for me?
Whitsuntide is at hand.
Children from the neighbourhood will gather here.
Our gate will be open to them.
God bless you, my son.
Where are you going, hussy?
Fetch water!
What ails you, my lady?
I'll soak your scarf in water.
That will do, my lord!
They'll go after it now.
It was created for hunting dogs.
Let it loose!
Go! Run away!
My horse!
Hurry up, Jakub!
Come no further!
It's marsh!
I found your father around here.
A branch had poked his eye out.
He fell off his horse and the dogs smelling blood tore him up.
I had to kill them.
Mother never told me.
No wonder, my lord.
She hates to think about it.
Why don't you go outside?
Get up!
Why should you kneel?
Don't come closer!
Leave me alone.
Go away!
What else do you want, Ondøej?
No! Ondøej, don't!
You brought disaster once.
Your father cursed me!
Leave me alone!
You'll leave me just like you left the Order.
I'm your mother.
Come to me, Ondøej.
It will start raining soon.
I'll show you my favorite spot.
Look, Ondøej.
Someone has been here.
We'll wait out the storm here.
Come closer.
What's the matter with you, Ondøej?
Can you see me by your side?
What happened?
Father Blažej promissed to marry us.
I knew you were near.
How can you tolerate what is going on in that impious castle?
Our church is poor.
He promised a donation every Ascension Day.
Every year.
Think of the punishment.
Any mendicant friar can marry them.
Or should they live in sin?
I came as a knight of the cross.
People welcome us everywhere.
They are afraid of our power.
But here people are like heathens. They fear nothing.
Ignorant of your Order's laws.
Holy law applies to all Christians.
Dear Lord.
Am I to take up the cross?
Can the two of us storm the castle?
I am as powerless as you are.
Those two live like animals!
Forgive them.
Life will punish them.
I could show mercy if they were clean.
My district was stricken with famine and the plague.
A man was caught eating corpses and was hung as a warning.
At night his wife came and dug up his body, and she and her children ate it.
She deserved to be hanged as he was.
And the children?
-The children, too.
-Were they not clean?
There is no difference.
Then there would be no human beings left alive.
Life would become extinct.
Let it be extinct.
Only angels will remain.
No one has ever seen them.
And yet I hear their wings beating.
They are here with us.
They must be.
Otherwise we would live in darkness like dogs or wolves.
I'm scared of you, brother.
Why should only the virtuous die, of cold and hunger in their cells?
Death brings redemption from such a loneliness.
I carried this sand all the way from the Holy Land.
It's soaked with my brother's blood.
But why was it their blood?
The others live without faith, and breed like flies.
There are ever more of them!
I have deep respect for your long pilgrimage.
-But go home.
-When is the wedding?
Go back to your people.
There you'll find peace.
At least you'll stay clean.
Bees are like people.
They fear and sense disaster.
You can destroy their homes, but you can't give pain to them.
They begin building new one right away.
Bring mye my sword!
What do you want?
I have come to say goodbye.
Goodbye, then, brother.
Close the gate behind him!
Don't drive out anyone.
Ondøej...
Today Vlkov Castle is open to all.
-Come. Don't stay there.
-No!
I'm Lenora, Ondøej's wife.
No, I cannot.
A trying journey awaits me.
You are tired, Armin.
Stay for a while.
Come join us.
I don't have a wedding gift.
I knew you would come.
I've been expecting you.
You are pale, sir.
Have you been ill?
Yes, my lady... ill.
Drink, Armin.
This is honey.
-Is it bitter?
-Thank you, my lady.
You thanked her without looking at her.
Members of the Order don't look at woman.
That belongs to the past.
Stay with us, Armin.
You can rest.
We can go hunting together.
You can have my dogs.
There is one thing
I brought...
Look, Lena.
-What a fine sand!
-It's from the seaside.
From the north.
Smile, Armin!
And embrace the bride!
What are you waiting for?
Everyone may kiss her today.
My God,
Why hast Thou forsaken me?
The bride...
The bride!
My God!
My lord!
He slit her throat!
-Why are you screaming?
-Lady Lenora!
You monster!
-Antichrist!
-Not here!
-Throw him into the courtyard!
-Kill him!
Beat him like a dog!
Kneel down!
-Ask God for forgivness!
-I cannot see!
Lock the gate!
Look at the cross!
The Dogs!
Markvart, unleash the hounds!
Pray for your soul to be saved!
Unleash the hounds, Markvart!
-Go, Ondøej!
-Clear the courtyard!
Take my cloak.
Go back, Ondøej.
You'll be forgiven.
Pray.
Pray for both of us.
Release them!
Ondøej! subtitles by prasopes
And so it fell out that at Pharsalia... the great might and manhood of Rome met in bloody civil war... and Caesar's legions destroyed those of the great Pompey... so that now only Caesar stood at the head of Rome.
But there was no joy for Caesar as in his other triumphs... for the dead which his legions counted and buried and burned... were their own countrymen.
The smoke of burning Roman dead is just as black... and the stink no less.
It was Pompey, not I, who wanted it so.
Let what I have said be set down.
You may stand.
Do not try and impress me by looking either too penitent or too proud.
As field officers, you fought miserably for Pompey.
Men under your command will be permitted to enlist in my legions... and returned to Rome as Romans.
You shall have the same privilege.
I'm not magnanimous. Your names are marked. You'll be watched.
First sign of treachery, you'll be killed.
What is it, Flavius? Antony?
Oh, yes. Canidius.
With news of Pompey, I hope.
- Hail Caesar!
- Drink that in my name, Canidius.
To all Marc Antony's cavalry,
Caesar's left wing and right arm.
What news of Pompey, or what's left of him?
Pompey's gone, Caesar.
Slipped through our fingers, disguised as a peddler.
- Leaving most of his merchandise.
- Gone? Where?
He has a galley waiting at the coast.
Provision enough for Egypt, they say.
Egypt. Possibly.
They owe him a great deal.
He'll ask for sanctuary.
Borrow money, borrow time.
I thought it was over.
It seems it's not.
Rufio, consult the augurers.
I want to know.
In Egypt, will Pompey face me at last?
But surely Caesar will now return to Rome!
I must go to Egypt in any case.
Young King Ptolemy and his sister have a civil war of their own... intent on destroying each other, and in the process, Rome's wheat.
That cannot be so urgent.
Let the Romans welcome great Caesar properly at last... in this greatest of his triumphs.
Triumph? Over what?
Over whom?
- Canidius.
- Caesar?
Leave me the 10th and 12th.
Antony's to take the rest to Rome.
- When can he start?
- Whenever you say.
Then at once.
And in Rome,
Marc Antony is to speak for Caesar.
His authority is not to be questioned.
His word will be yours.
As always, Caesar's word is law.
Of course.
But remind him to keep his legions intact. They make the law legal.
Caesar.
And even as Caesar's galleys sailed the great sea to Egypt... it was happening that, just as the Romans... so the Egyptians made war, one upon the other... for young King Ptolemy would no longer share the throne... with his sister Cleopatra... but drove her from the city of Alexandria... and sought to destroy her.
We've arrived on their market day.
Once a week they're allowed in the royal enclosure.
Where's the guard of honor for Caesar?
Some representative of the royal or military?
We have the privilege of watching
Caesar battle through our marketplace.
Marcellus, a dozen front-rank men, swords only.
Clear a direct line to the palace steps.
Then as many more to keep it open.
It's precisely what they hope we'd be stupid enough to do: manhandle their people.
No. This is their market day, we will go marketing.
- You're not serious.
- We'll shop our way to the palace.
Have you my money?
Everything is to be paid for by coin.
Tell them to put away the swords and carry moneybags.
Olives. Oil of olives.
The wine of Samos.
How much for your wine? Four drachma.
Sixty of your wine for my men.
Pay him.
You said they'd push the people and make them angry.
Why aren't they doing what you said they'd do?
Your king has asked a question,
Lord Chamberlain.
The Romans have degenerated minds,
Most High Majesty.
They do the unexpected.
Particularly one Roman.
Master of the unexpected.
But with so few men.
You all look so impressive.
Any one of you could be king.
His Divine Majesty, my Lord Ptolemy... lord of the Upper and Lower regions... son of Ra, of Horus and of Thoth, beloved of...
Et cetera, et cetera. You welcome me.
And I, Gaius Julius Caesar,
Pontifex Maximus... et cetera, et cetera, thank you.
From the Senate and people of Rome, hail King Ptolemy.
And his sister and co-ruler,
Queen Cleopatra?
They won't tell you so, but Cleopatra's dead.
She tried to kill me, and we chased her into the desert.
And there she died.
Whereas it is true that His Majesty's sister... repeatedly plotted to have him killed... it is not true that Cleopatra is dead.
Whereas it is true that she fled from Alexandria...
I seem to always interrupt you... but the search for truth can go on and on.
Pothinus, is it not?
Lord Chamberlain and chief eunuch to King Ptolemy. An exalted rank.
Obtained not without certain, shall we say, sacrifice.
Theodotus, am I right?
Tutor to His Majesty in history, philosophy and ambition.
And Achillas.
They say you're a good soldier.
- As one to another, where is Cleopatra?
- With her army.
And how many of your men between her and Alexandria?
- Enough.
- May I speak?
Surely you have come in peace.
And we present ourselves to you in warm and respectful welcome.
Our only problem being an internal one, of concern only to us... why have you come, Caesar?
As we all know, when the father of both Ptolemy and Cleopatra died... he named the two of them to rule jointly over Egypt.
Rome was appointed their guardian and the executor of his will.
I have come in the name of Rome to ask why Cleopatra has been deposed... to resolve the differences between her and King Ptolemy... and to see that they peacefully resume their joint rule of Egypt.
That will be difficult.
Cleopatra has forfeited her right.
I shall try to decide justly.
Don't you see he'll send for her?
He'll bring her back!
The sun which sheds its grace upon the ruler of the two lands... burns too brightly perhaps.
If Lord Ptolemy wishes to retire...
I wish nothing of the kind!
I won't be put out of the way until I've watched you give him that!
A thousand pardons,
I had almost forgotten.
Lord Ptolemy wishes to enhance his welcome by a gift of some importance.
Most generous.
The ring. Give him Pompey's ring.
And now the token of
His Majesty's affection for Rome... and regard for Caesar.
Pompey the Great.
Dead men, they say, do not bite.
Does it please you, Caesar?
They said it would please you very much.
The sun does shed its grace too brightly.
It has become too hot here for kings.
My Lord Ptolemy will retire.
For His Majesty, a Roman guard of honor.
It was not by your hand, of course.
If, as you say, you've been told of me, you know better, Caesar.
My men shall be properly housed and fed.
- May I speak?
- Not until you're spoken to.
I'll require rooms in the palace.
I shall consider myself honored to escort you.
Anyone but you.
Find the rest of Pompey.
Tear out a thousand tongues, but find him.
Have him purified... the coin in the mouth and the rest, honorably.
Of course.
For now, this is what we must hold.
Moon gate and three others.
Here, here and here.
How are we placed?
The 10th slingers on the moon gate.
The rest in reserve.
The 12th holding all other positions.
Very thin.
For now, deep enough.
- Have we tested the wells?
- The water's brackish, but drinkable.
So far. Keep an eye on them.
Watch the corn and wheat.
With our supplies secure, we can hold indefinitely.
For a week, perhaps.
For the time being, time enough.
What do you want?
Is the man to be trusted?
Seems someone's brought me a gift... from Queen Cleopatra.
Apparently, a rug peddler.
Flavius doubts it.
He seems to know the palace very well.
He appeared through a secret passage which none of the men knew.
Pothinus might send an assassin in Cleopatra's name.
Have the man brought in.
Are you the one who brings a gift from Cleopatra?
Put it down and go.
It is the command of my queen
I deliver her gift personally.
I am Caesar. Lay it here before me.
Forgive me, Admiral Agrippa, but you're not Caesar.
Nor you, General Rufio.
Nor you, Germanicus.
My queen's gift is for the eyes of Caesar... alone.
- It seems harmless enough.
- No, Caesar!
You can lend me your sword, Rufio.
It may require some cutting.
Odd way to carry a rug.
Isn't it easier to sling it over your shoulder?
It was less comfortable that way.
- For you or the rug?
- That sword, Caesar.
The rug is such a delicate weave.
If I may untie it for you.
Turn it over first.
- But the rug is right-side up.
- I want it the wrong side up.
- Should I flip it over with my sword?
- No, no, no.
I find one can tell more about the quality of merchandise... by examining the back side first.
All hail Cleopatra, kindred of Horus and Ra... beloved of the moon and sun, daughter to Isis... and of Upper and Lower Egypt, queen.
Thank you.
Here.
Take this to the captain of the night watch.
He'll see the queen's quarters are made ready to her.
Stay where you are.
- Have I dismissed you?
- No, Your Majesty.
This is my palace, Caesar.
All of it is available to me at my will.
I am not your prisoner.
If anything, you are my guest.
Most kind.
And as for having my quarters, as you put it, made ready... my chief handmaiden has, by now, brought the others out of hiding.
They should almost be finished.
Impossible.
The doors are under guard.
There are doors, and doors.
Oh, yes. Of course.
You must take me on a tour someday within the walls of your palace.
- What are you waiting for?
- Permission to leave.
Granted.
Apollodorus.
Thank you.
I'm pleased you received my summons and were able to...
Summons? I'm pleased to say
I received nothing of the kind.
I'm surprised you thought
I would answer one.
Young lady, the voyage in your non-magic carpet... has apparently not tired you, but I'm exhausted.
Caesar, it is essential we understand each other.
Only through me can you hope to escape... the desperate situation in which you find yourself.
I wouldn't bite into that.
Did you bring it with you?
Have you had it tasted?
If neither, it's probably poisoned.
At least it's another way out of the desperate situation in which I'm found.
You're being tolerant of me, aren't you?
Is it because you're so much older?
Your maps are inferior.
Out-of-date, compared to mine.
They and I have aged together.
The lakes to the west are poorly marked... certain important hill positions not even noted.
I must arrange for you to address my mapmakers and general staff.
We've gotten off to a bad start, haven't we?
I've rubbed you the wrong way.
I'm not sure I want to be rubbed by you at all, young lady.
It is permissible for me to sit, is it not?
As quickly as possible you must set me alone on the throne of Egypt.
My mission is to put to an end the tiresome squabbling between your brother and you.
You're not a fool. Or are you?
Immodestly, perhaps, no.
You've seen my brother and listened to him?
And that truly evil man to whom he belongs?
Yes.
Shall we agree upon what Rome really wants... has always wanted of Egypt?
Corn, grain, treasure.
It's the old story.
Roman greatness built upon Egyptian riches.
You shall have them.
You shall have them all and in peace.
But there is only one way.
My way. Make me queen.
That sounds very much like an ultimatum.
There is no other way.
For one whose assets, up to a few moments ago... was a devoted slave and a rolled-up carpet...
But I have you now, Caesar.
Besides, there are my armies... and the simple fact that no mortal hand can destroy me.
Yes, I recall some mention of an obsession... you have about your divinity.
Isis, is it not?
I shall have to insist that you mind what you say.
I am Isis. I am worshiped by millions who believe it.
Do not confuse what I am... with the so-called divine origin... that every Roman general acquires together with his shield.
It was Venus you chose to be descended from, wasn't it?
I must now do a little insisting of my own.
First, your journey has tired you and you wish to retire.
I am not your servant, Caesar.
Do not dismiss me.
Secondly, you have no armies, young lady.
They are gone because you could not pay them.
Egypt's riches are not available for your own use... much less to give away.
Perhaps in a day or two...
- ...we can speak again.
- That may be too late... for both of us.
Your safety will be my responsibility.
And what about your own?
I am prepared, I believe, for the time being.
I hope so.
I hope you are as wise, as brilliant... the god they say you are.
You Roman generals become divine so quickly.
A few victories, a few massacres.
Only yesterday, Pompey was a god.
- They murdered him, didn't they?
- Yes.
Because they thought it would please you.
- It didn't, did it?
- No.
Today I found myself remembering how much my daughter loved him.
She died trying to bear him a son.
She gave him this ring.
Sleep well tonight, Caesar.
These next days may be difficult for you.
Good night.
Germanicus, a guard to escort
Queen Cleopatra to her apartments.
Guards!
The corridors are dark, gentlemen.
But you mustn't be afraid.
I am with you.
Haven't we covered everything we can tonight, sir?
- Perhaps a fresh start in the morning.
- No, a few more matters.
Rufio, has it occurred to you that our maps of this area... are not quite what they should be?
Why, no. What makes you think they're not?
I have an instinct about these things.
Actually of Macedonian descent.
No officially-admitted Egyptian blood.
"Reputed to be extremely intelligent and sharp of wit."
Queen Cleopatra is widely read.
Well-versed in the sciences... and mathematics.
She speaks seven languages proficiently.
"Were she not a woman, she'd be considered an intellectual."
Nothing bores me so much as an intellectual.
Makes a better admiral of you,
Agrippa.
Here's something of more interest to the navy:
"ln obtaining her objectives, she has been known to use torture, poison..." and even her own sexual talents, which are said to be considerable.
Her lovers, I am told, are listed more easily by number than by name.
It is said that she chooses in the manner of a man...
"...rather than wait to be chosen after womanly fashion."
Well, there's more reason than we thought... for not wanting to leave you two alone, eh, sir?
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
Are you inclined to trust Cleopatra?
Trust? Not for a minute.
"Trust." The word has always made me apprehensive.
Like wine, whenever I've tried it, the aftereffects have not been good.
So I've given up wine... and trusting.
Oh, it's been a long and difficult day, gentlemen.
The next few may be even longer and more difficult.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Flavius!
It is autumn again, my best-loved Lesbia
Look, the torrents of Roman leaves
Are falling, falling
And lovers revive in kisses
The promise of spring
Which will end the winter world
With new nightingales calling
I taste your food, daughter of Isis... and if there be harm in it, let the harm fall upon me.
But love must bring
Despair one day
As beauty, sorrow
- Why do you stop, Phoebus?
- In the corridor, there is movement.
That's how the Romans frighten the enemy...
- ...by stamping their elephant feet.
- No, this is one man... followed by others.
- Caesar, I would say.
- Would you?
We must not disappoint the mighty Caesar.
The Romans tell fabulous tales of my bath... and handmaidens... and my morals.
Cleopatra's requested an audience with me.
- That was yesterday, Caesar.
- I've been occupied.
The queen is occupied with her bath.
Perhaps Caesar could return later...
- ...or tomorrow.
- I'm afraid not. Hold him.
No, don't hurt him.
You're a good man, Apollodorus.
I hope you're appreciated.
Wait here for me.
Then let us live and love
Without one thought
For the gossip of virgins
Now grown old and stale
Suns go down and may return
But once put out
Our own brief light
We sleep through
One eternal night
An intruder! A man!
Oh, it's you.
You wanted to see me?
I summoned you yesterday... to an audience in my throne room.
I was told I was not permitted to go there.
It's too close to the quarters occupied by your brother and the rest.
I will not be told where
I can go and where I cannot go!
Since there's nothing you want...
Except my throne!
At least you've dressed properly for my presence.
Your best armor?
Almost, but I'm afraid it's not being worn in your honor.
I know.
This morning, you paid a formal visit to the tomb of Alexander.
You remained alone beside the sarcophagus for some time.
I'd like to know how you know.
Just staring down at him.
And then you cried.
Why did you cry, Caesar?
That man recites beautifully.
- Is he blind?
- Don't you hurt him.
I won't. Not anyone who speaks Catullus so well.
Catullus doesn't approve of you.
Why haven't you had him killed?
Because I approve of him.
My desire to please you, Caesar
Is very slight
Nor do I greatly care to know
If you are black or white
Achillas is moving his entire army to Alexandria.
By tonight, he'll outnumber you
20-to-1, 30-to-1.
He'll have the royal enclosure entirely surrounded.
Except to the sea.
Do you plan to sail away, great Caesar?
Not for the time being.
Achillas may attack tomorrow, the next day...
- ...whenever it suits him!
- Very probable.
In your wildest dreams, Caesar, how can you possibly hope to hold... the gates of this enclosure against such odds?
And if you say once more,
"For the time being"...
My officers say anything from a week to indefinitely.
What would you estimate?
Before you're without water... without food... your troops slaughtered, picked off from the rooftops... poisoned in the brothels?
A few days, Caesar.
At the most, a few days.
I'm inclined to agree with you.
Young man, do you know this of Catullus?
Give me a thousand
And a thousand kisses
When we have many thousand more
We'll scramble them
And forget the score
So evil envy will not know
How high the count
And cast its evil eye
It couldn't have been as pleasant in the throne room.
"My desire to please you, Caesar,
Is very slight..."
Be still!
Caesar, a word. It's important.
The Egyptian galleys in the harbor have been taking on men and armaments.
- When will they be prepared?
- Tomorrow, with the morning wind.
Burn them tonight.
Their ships lie close to shore.
- The fire may spread to the city.
- Let's hope it doesn't.
I can't risk a blockade.
Remember, not before tonight.
Prepare as secretly as possible.
I need this day.
Good luck.
Why not before tonight, my lord?
Why does Caesar need this day?
I can't give you that information, for the time being.
Flavius.
Here it is, Caesar. Just arrived.
The gods shouldn't tantalize us so, Rufio.
It's even better than I'd hoped.
- Be on your way, you haven't much time.
- Hail Caesar.
It's called an epilepse because of the arching caused by muscular spasms... the contortions.
The early Greeks considered... those who suffered from it to be favored by the gods.
The great Alexander, they say... had this falling sickness.
And, so they say, the mighty Caesar too.
Your Majesty, forgive me.
Sosigenes, the library.
- What are you saying?
- The Romans set fire...
- ...to the Egyptian fleet.
- It's about time.
Come see for yourself.
The fire's spread to the city.
- The city?
- Just a few buildings... but the library is burning.
The great library.
Aristotle's manuscripts.
The Platonic commentaries, the plays, the histories.
The Testament of the Hebrew god.
The Book of Books.
- Wind blew into the merchant shipping.
- Four or five burned and sank right here.
- And our ships?
- Safe and dry.
Prisoners are surrendering in droves.
I need help.
- Not one man. I may need your sailors.
- Halt!
Take your hands off me!
You should attack my guards more often. Battle seems to become you.
You grow more beautiful each time I see you.
And you grow bolder.
And busier.
- Actually, we're extremely busy...
- Do you smell smoke?
We found it necessary to burn the Egyptian fleet.
The ships were in the water.
Did you find it necessary to burn them in the streets?
Merchant ships caught fire.
The burning masts fell.
Some houses...
One of them, the great
Library of Alexandria.
Yes, I've been told.
I'm extremely sorry.
- Now, if you don't mind, I must ask...
- I do mind.
Are you putting the fire out?
We're forming prisoners into fire brigades.
Oh, I see. Romans only start fires, is that it?
Have you broken out of your nursery to come irritate the adults?
Another time, we're working.
- Shall we remove her for you, Caesar?
- Use that Roman genius for destruction.
Tear down pyramids, wipe out cities!
How dare you and the rest of your barbarians set fire to my library?
Play conqueror all you want, mighty Caesar.
Rape, murder, pillage thousands, millions of human beings.
But neither you nor any other barbarian... has the right to destroy one human thought!
Enough!
Leave me alone with her.
I will send for you when I finish.
It won't be long.
Swords? Javelins?
Or are you going to set me on fire?
The time has come for us to understand each other.
Whatever else I may be, in your opinion, first of all, I am Caesar.
And I am Cleopatra, queen, daughter of Isis!
If I say so and when I say so, you are what I say you are... nothing more.
Hail Caesar!
You, descendant of inbred generations of incestuous mental defectives...
- ...how dare you call anyone barbarian.
- Barbarian!
Daughter of a drunkard who bribed his way to the throne.
- Your price was too high, remember?
- I've had my fill with you pretenders...
- ...parading on ruins of your past glories.
- Only the future concerns me.
- Keep out of my affairs, do as I say.
- Do as you say?
Literally?
As if I were something you had conquered?
If I choose to regard you as such.
Am I to understand that you're free to do with me whatever you want... whenever you want?
Yes, I want that understood.
Won't you at least wear your laurel wreath... so I can be reminded it's the divine Caesar that honors me so?
You talk too much.
I promise you... you won't like me this way.
Caesar! An attack on the moon gate!
The moon gate.
An attack in force!
Those ballistas need eliminating.
Send out a turtle.
Form the turtle!
Now is the time for us to attack!
- No.
- We have a full legion in reserve.
We hold our positions here.
Two hours till dawn.
We'll hold where we are.
- And what happens at dawn?
- I thought you knew.
The sun comes up.
Tell the men they've won.
Liberty and wine for defenders of the gate.
All reserves, cavalry, every man available, move out behind Achillas.
- We have him in a vise.
- What is the other half of this vise?
Rufio and the armies of Mithradates.
He left last night to meet them.
Mithradates? How could he get here this fast?
I sent him when we sailed for Egypt.
No general in his right mind can hold Alexandria with two legions... as you and others have repeatedly pointed out to me.
I taste your drink, daughter of Isis... and if there be harm in it, let the harm fall upon me.
Lotus.
You wiped the rim of the cup after you tasted it. Why?
Why? So my mouth would not soil it.
Lotus... taste it again.
Pothinus said he would have me killed.
Forgive me, Majesty.
Forgive me. Forgive me.
I forgive you.
Now drink it.
Apollodorus!
Great silence for Gaius Julius Caesar... consul of the senate of the people of Rome.
You will all stand.
Let what is said be recorded... as the judgment and decree of the Senate and people of Rome.
There is no judgment here.
And the decree not Rome's, but Cleopatra's.
She has lied to you, Caesar.
She and her slaves lie to you.
You have not been accused, Pothinus.
Thus far.
You are now charged with inciting and abetting war against the Roman army.
You are now charged with plotting to assassinate Queen Cleopatra.
You are guilty of both.
You are sentenced to death.
It's too bright in here.
Shut out some of the sun.
Are you going to kill me too, Caesar?
What am I accused of?
King Ptolemy is hereby removed from the protective custody of Rome.
He'll leave within the hour... and be conducted safely to the camp of Achillas.
Achillas! You're going to send me back to my own troops?
He is to be accompanied by his learned tutor, Theodotus.
Do you hear that?
You'll be saved along with me.
Stop grinning, you little idiot.
May I speak?
You know that Achillas is trapped... between your own legions and the armies of Mithradates.
To send His Majesty to fight them may mean his death.
An occupational hazard for those who will be king.
But then certainly not I, Caesar.
I'm no king, nor general.
What do I know of war?
A simple scholar.
A man of thoughts and words.
Too many words. Enough.
Let all be done properly as decreed.
Flavius.
Find Apollodorus.
Return his dagger to him.
You might clean it first.
It has Pothinus all over it.
Yes, yes, I know I'm tired.
I promise I'll sleep.
You have my apologies for what almost happened to you.
Caesar, will you talk with me for just a minute?
Yesterday was full.
Tonight was long.
This morning has not been uneventful.
Did you know that Apollodorus would kill Pothinus?
He was kind enough to wait until Rome had passed sentence of death.
And my brother... and Theodotus?
They too will be killed, possibly.
Probably.
Your Majesty, I'm truly weary.
You knew all along, didn't you, that there was no real danger.
That Mithradates was on his way to reinforce you.
Why didn't you tell me?
I said I was prepared.
You wouldn't believe me.
- I really must insist...
- I would've believed you.
- You didn't trust me.
- Not for an instant.
And yet, in these last few minutes... you have made me undisputed queen.
The sole ruler of Egypt. Why?
Perhaps tomorrow, later in the day, we could talk.
- Why, Caesar?
- It was best for Rome. Please.
- Best for Egypt.
- For Egypt too.
Cleopatra, get out.
I beg of you, get out.
That will not be needed.
It wasn't necessary for me to betray myself.
I could have called out for Flavius.
How many new spy-holes have you dug in the walls?
Are we being watched even now?
If you see Flavius, you might send him to me.
- Still trying to dismiss me?
- What is it you want?
- What more do you want?
- To be of help to you.
There never has been help.
There never will be.
Now there is.
One day it'll happen where I cannot hide.
Where the world will see me fall.
I shall tumble down before the mob... and foam at the mouth and make them laugh.
And they'll tear me to pieces.
The gods themselves had your sickness.
Hannibal, even the great Alexander.
And in the end, they fell.
Were torn to pieces by the mob.
Not you.
I will see to that.
In the name of the Senate and the people of Rome and by their will.
Isis herself would surrender her place in heaven to be as beautiful as you.
You're not supposed to look at me. No one is.
If they aren't looking, how do they know I am?
You should be kneeling.
Would that do before all these visiting kings?
Making believe they're not watching us?
You have such bony knees.
Not only bony, but unaccustomed to this sort of thing.
If we're to get an early start in the morning...
What will it be tomorrow?
More wheat?
What I've seen already could feed more legions than Rome ever had.
There's enough to feed the world.
More gold then.
Why not buy the world?
Surely you have enough.
At least enough to pay more legions than even Rome has ever had.
More granite, more marble... more millions of slaves to build whatever needs building.
Better routes to India, shorter routes to the East.
What can there be in Egypt that I haven't seen?
Egypt itself. The reason for Egypt.
My responsibility is Rome.
Alexander understood it... that from Egypt he could rule the world.
He was very young.
And you, even younger.
At your age, such dreams have a reality which grows less in time.
Caesar no longer dreams?
Dangerous to a man of my calling.
Necessary, I would have thought.
I can't stay away from Rome too long.
There are problems.
Messages from Marc Antony endlessly demanding my return.
And on my way back, wars to be fought in the east and north.
Even in Rome itself
I'm not without opposition.
Do to them what you did to Achillas.
This is opposition of a different sort.
They weave it cleverly, lightly, like a cobweb.
You know what happens when cobwebs are not regularly swept away.
Do you trust this Marc Antony?
If anyone in the world,
I trust Antony.
Let him brush away the cobwebs for you and stay with me.
You've been declared dictator for a year.
You can do what you want with your time.
Everything but make it stand still.
If... When you return to Rome... these wars that have to be fought on the way, are they important?
Well, there's no such thing as an unimportant war.
I've been reading in your commentaries about your campaigns in Gaul.
How does my writing compare with Catullus?
Well, it's different.
Dull.
Perhaps a little too much description.
You're being tactful.
Some of my critics, Brutus, for one... tell me my Latin is not only ungrammatical, but common.
You spared his life more than once.
People say it's because
Brutus is your son.
Is that true?
I have no son.
- Calpurnia, your third wife...
- Fourth.
Married to you how long?
12 years?
And still, Caesar has no son, no child at all.
It is well-known that
Calpurnia is barren.
A woman who cannot bear children... is like a river that is dry.
I see no purpose in discussing the subject further.
A woman, too, must make the barren land fruitful.
She must make life grow where there was no life.
Just as the Mother Nile feeds and replenishes the earth.
I am the Nile.
I will bear many sons.
Isis has told me.
My breasts are filled with love and life.
My hips are rounded and well apart.
Such women, they say... have sons.
That first time when you stood here alone... why did you cry?
Will you tell me now?
Because I had lost something.
- What?
- A lifetime.
- Mine.
- Nonsense.
Having conquered the world, he died at 32.
I am 52.
My remaining ambition is to keep the world from conquering me.
Your ambitions must always have been his.
They still must be.
Shall I tell you something?
When I was 32 in Spain...
I came upon a statue of Alexander.
I wept then too.
Even then.
I want you to have his sword to take back with you.
- Too deeply embedded.
- It can be removed.
It's buried in time.
- And Alexander's mantle?
- Too heavy for Caesar.
His dream then.
Make his dream yours, Caesar.
His grand design.
Pick it up where he left off.
Out of the patchwork of conquests... one world.
And out of one world, one nation.
One people on earth living in peace.
So you have told me at last what it is you want of me.
Of us!
At the center, the capital of this world, one people, one nation...
Alexandria?
- He chose it.
- I am Roman.
He was Greek! What will it matter when we're all one people?
I am 52. He was 32 and failed.
We will succeed.
Your dreams, your ambitions.
One lifetime is not enough for such dreams, such ambitions.
The cloak of Alexander cannot be too heavy... for Rome and Egypt to carry together.
And what if his sword is too deeply embedded?
Yours will replace it, Caesar.
You have a way of mixing politics and passion.
Where does one begin and the other leave off?
That did not start, nor will it end with me.
Cleopatra, whatever it is, however it comes out... leave me my destiny.
Your destiny is no longer just yours.
It's mine too.
Soon, there will be someone to carry both the cloak of Alexander... and the sword of Caesar... and the name of Caesar.
And in that name he will rule Egypt.
And whatever part or all of the world that we give him... our child... will be a son for you, Caesar.
By Isis, I swear it.
Could you put off your return to Rome... just long enough?
I came as quickly as I could.
Antony is welcome to Caesar's house as often and as quickly as he likes.
As Caesar's wife, before truth is distorted into vicious gossip...
- I wanted you to hear...
- That my husband has married Cleopatra.
There's some fresh wine.
One of your many favorites.
The ceremony, according to vicious gossip, was in the Egyptian religion.
Even if true, that can't be taken seriously.
During which he was formally declared an Egyptian god.
Officially divine, at last.
That must have pleased Caesar.
Calpurnia, we know Caesar, you and I.
This so-called marriage has no validity under Roman law.
There must be political purpose to it.
Perhaps a symbolic ceremony to ratify Rome's alliance with Egypt.
Perhaps merely indulging some barbaric custom.
You've been loyal and kind.
You came as quickly as you could.
Unhappily, vicious gossip travels even faster than you... and the truth.
Have you heard, for instance, that
Cleopatra is carrying Caesar's child?
Yes, Antony.
We know him... you and I.
There shall be...
There shall be...
Rome.
Mighty and alone and unloved.
A mistress.
A mistress shall raise thee again from earth to heaven... and all the world shall know a golden age ofjustice and of love.
A son shall be born to Isis!
Rome shall know him in cloth of gold.
The East shall see him laden with jewels and treasure.
A son of Egypt and of Rome!
Here shall he find his destiny!
Do exactly as I tell you.
When the child is born... after he is anointed and named royal prince... take him to Caesar.
Bring Caesar here.
No. Exactly as I tell you.
Take the child to Caesar, in front of his men.
Do you understand?
In front of all the Romans.
Lay him at Caesar's feet.
At Caesar's feet.
I will do just as you say.
Fear not.
We have never lost a Caesar.
That remark was insubordinate and in bad taste!
Caesar, remember Roman law.
If you pick up this child you acknowledge it's yours... and a citizen of Rome, as your heir.
A son.
I have a son!
- Hail Caesar!
- Hail Caesar!
He's been made king of Egypt.
They have named their bastard
Caesarion.
Prince Caesarion.
What better name for the heir to the throne of Rome.
There is no throne of Rome.
Nor shall there be, nor would Caesar tolerate one.
But a son!
We know how much he's wanted one.
I am happy for Caesar.
Your happiness is understandable enough.
Now that Caesar has publicly recognized a son... one need no longer wonder about Brutus.
Is it a relief not to be wondered about, Casca?
To be known openly as you are for what you are:
Liar, swindler, bully and coward.
Brutus, you'll turn Casca's head with your flattery.
And Casca's head, if turned, will see Marc Antony.
A part of Caesar more to be feared than his infant son.
But it is for the good of Rome that
Caesar has stayed so long in Egypt.
In his absence, the people have come to worship him as a god.
Why should he return to show himself as mortal as the rest?
There are those who fear Caesar's ambition.
But what is there to fear?
That he will destroy the republic?
Yes, he will.
I promise you he will.
Your tongue is old but sharp, Cicero.
Be careful how you waggle it.
It may cut off your head.
It will more likely be your sword, Antony.
'Tis just as sharp and quicker... and frightened of heads.
There'll be a strong smell of wine in the Senate today.
We must breathe with restraint.
Octavian, this what's his name, this son of Caesar... does it upset you?
No.
You run off at the mouth so... one thinks your words are as precious to you as your gold.
Like my gold, I use them where they are worth most.
And your virtue?
My friend has a friend.
That too.
You know, it's quite possible,
Octavian, that when you die... you will die without ever having been alive.
I can't leave without saying goodbye to my son and to you.
We thought, your son and I, that if we came to you... we would have those few minutes more.
A good thing to remember, my son:
What you will not let go, no one will take from you.
Hail and farewell, little Caesar.
Was it a century ago when I was dropped at your feet, wrapped in a carpet?
Or was it last night?
When will you send for us? When?
- Soon.
- How soon? When?
So much time must go by before even I reach Rome.
And then how soon?
Within reasonable time.
Time is never reasonable.
Time is our enemy, Caesar.
Am I to conquer it for you?
What plan of battle do you suggest?
I must bring your son to Rome.
Rome must see Caesar's son... who will one day rule over Caesar's world.
Caesar?
I'm afraid the tides will soon be against you.
Not only time, but the tides.
Even as divinities, there seems little we can do about either.
But only after more than two years... and many wars in Africa and Asia Minor... was Caesar able to cross over to Italy and come home at last... to celebrate his triumphs and see to his affairs.
"In recognition, the Senate has bestowed upon Caesar... the rank, privilege and title of dictator of Rome for life."
Dictator for life!
At long last, he is master of Rome.
Apollodorus, everything must be made ready at once.
- Ships, servants...
- We've been ready for some time.
Surely now nothing can prevent his sending for us... if only to attend his coronation as he did mine.
- Your Majesty...
- Three long, wasted years!
Why should the Senate have taken so long... to recognize what the world has already known?
That Caesar was master of Rome.
Rufio wishes to speak.
Your Majesty seems to misunderstand.
It seems quite clear. Caesar has been declared dictator of Rome for life.
True. However, to the Roman... there is a vast difference between dictator and master.
No man can call himself master of Rome.
Why not?
It has a meaning far too close to a word no Roman will tolerate:
King.
And to be dictator of Rome for life?
Is to be granted the lifelong respect and honor of the Roman people.
And the dictates of the dictator?
Must in each case, of course, be approved by the Senate of Rome.
Thank you, Rufio.
The enemy! The enemy! The enemy!
Sosigenes.
You must think it odd that I propose an invitation to Queen Cleopatra.
Do you?
Egypt, after all, has been officially declared ally of Rome.
Still, I confess I was surprised at some of those who voted in favor.
Were you?
May I express my gratitude for being permitted to attend today's session?
It was truly inspiring... to witness the free will of free men so fearlessly expressed.
He seemed most anxious to be present.
- I saw no harm in granting him permission.
- Didn't you?
After today, never again shall I doubt the extent of Egypt's wealth.
I don't like Cicero's implication.
There's not enough gold in Egypt to buy the honor of a Roman senator.
More than enough, it seems, to buy his vote.
How was it now?
"Rome will know him in cloth of gold."
According to reports, the reception in the streets has been extraordinary.
The queen has instructed the procession to move slowly... for the people's enjoyment.
I might almost believe Cleopatra set out to capture the citizens of Rome.
One would have every reason for believing exactly that.
Nothing like this has come into Rome since Romulus and Remus.
How unafraid he is.
Your queen has conquered the people of Rome.
The people, yes.
Now then, walk like a king.
Head up.
Listen to them cheer.
Take your throne.
Bow to the right, left.
Now an angry glance at someone who's displeased you.
Very good. I tremble.
See me tremble?
No, don't smile.
Not when they're trembling.
It makes them stop.
Now the prisoners are dragged before you, one by one.
This one has no power anywhere, therefore means nothing.
But you wish to be known as a noble ruler. What do you say?
I pardon you.
Louder, boy. You pardon somebody, you want it known.
I pardon you!
Now, who comes here?
Once your friend. You trusted him, and he turned against you.
He has power, wealth and family.
He kneels.
He begs you to be his friend again.
To have you trust him again.
And then? What then, little king?
Caesar must wish what needs commanding.
To drain the Pontine Marshes.
To free Rome from malaria.
To fill my belly.
To control the Tiber's floods.
To improve the harbor at Ostia.
To please my ambition.
And must I wish roads to be built, libraries for public use?
The free men of Italy to be equal citizens to those of Rome?
Many of these have merits and merit our approval.
"Merit your approval." Is Caesar to come before the Senate each day... like a schoolboy with his lessons, now passing, now failing?
Do you suggest the Senate no longer deliberate the welfare of Rome?
To end the process of Roman law?
I must be the law! And my word must be the welfare of Rome.
Else, take from me this meaningless title of dictator.
I've carried a sword for too long.
I cannot now pretend with an empty scabbard.
Surely Caesar recalls the symbolic nature of the title "dictator"... at the time it was conferred.
It was to honor Caesar above all men... and to indicate Rome's gratitude for Caesar's triumphs in its name.
Brutus, I recall them well, those triumphs.
Do you?
Pharsalia, for one.
You trembled in Antony's hand... when Antony was hot to separate you from your head... with just cause.
My command spared your life.
There was no deliberating body.
It was not my wish, but my command.
By my dictate that you stand here dribbling virtue out of your mouth.
Sit down.
No, I want no more meaningless privileges and considerations.
No more honors designed to pacify me.
I would rather have nothing.
Remain what I am at heart.
A humble man, anxious only to serve.
Why are the eyes of a statue always without life?
Have any of you here seen the Nile?
Spare yourselves the journey.
She carries it within her eyes.
I suggest, Caesar, that the hour is late.
Very late for Rome.
I was speaking, Cassius! I was...
Now, where was I?
"Anxious to serve."
Yes, I've served.
Served for all of my life.
I've won for Rome more than half of the world.
Most of you owe your honors and fortunes to me.
And now I want you to do as I say.
You will appoint me... emperor of Rome.
There is no need to resume your seats.
On behalf of all, thank you,
Majesty, for your hospitality.
Good night.
Thank you and good night.
They resent being summoned here for meetings properly held in the Senate.
Resent it, do they?
I cannot understand... that the eyes of a statue should be always without life.
They resent me.
To flaunt me like this.
They'll use it to keep from you that which is already yours.
By divine right, is that not so?
Yes. It is.
By divine right.
We shall have the Senate, in its deliberations, deliberate that.
Are you quite sure what it is you want... so desperately?
I've always been sure.
And Caesar?
Does anyone speak for him?
No.
Good night.
Tell me, Brutus, is it proper to stand before this new goddess...
- ...Caesar has set here in the temple?
- Or must we, as Romans, kneel?
Not yet. See there, where room has been left for another deity?
When the god Caesar stands beside the goddess Cleopatra... then Rome will crawl before them.
When that day comes, if it comes.
- He demanded we make him emperor.
- Once. That one night, it was his sickness.
His sickness grows worse.
In the end, it will kill us.
He asked once to be made emperor, but he's since decreed himself a god!
Emperor and god. No longer just king, but emperor and god!
- Brutus, open your eyes!
- What do you want of me?
When the people think upon the honor of Rome... they think upon one man:
He is Brutus.
By that honor and by the responsibility you carry...
Brutus, save Rome from Caesar!
You cannot ask me to destroy him.
Then let Caesar destroy Rome.
Antony has just come from a meeting of my friends with good news.
Tomorrow at the Senate, Lucius Cotta will move that I be made king.
It will pass.
But I don't understand.
King and emperor.
And it will pass?
The last few months,
I've been enjoying... one of the few privileges of being dictator.
I have been appointing senators.
Slightly more than half the Senate has been appointed by me.
Once again, the army of Mithradates... on its way all the time.
It will pass.
Tomorrow, the ides of March, a day to be remembered... the Senate will declare me king of Rome.
King, yes, but not of Rome.
Not of Rome? What are you saying?
They'll offer you king of the Roman Empire, outside Italy.
They're afraid, Caesar.
Even your friends.
Afraid of the people.
- Perhaps in time...
- To be afraid of the people.
To waste time on the people.
King of all but Rome?
What is there? The huts of Gaul?
The caves of Britain?
The whole of the empire outside Italy.
I will not accept.
They mean it to be an empty gesture.
Another title to please your fancy, flatter your ego.
Nothing more.
And it will pass.
Then accept it, Caesar.
I have never settled for half a victory.
Nor will you now.
Caesar, mighty Caesar... all I can say is what you've taught me:
Take a little, then a little more until finally you have it all.
Let them declare you king.
Even if it's only of a tree in Asia Minor.
The rest will come to you.
To redo once more everything
I have already done?
It's what you have never done, what you never conquered that waits for you.
The great legions of Rome in the outer empire that will become your legions.
The gold, the power of Egypt.
Your Egypt.
Caesar, you can conquer and hold the world as your own.
Won't you understand?
Kings are not elected.
Gods are not elected.
Why, not only Rome but all of Italy upon which Rome stands... must fall in your hands like a drop of sweat.
Let them make you what they choose.
I'll serve with you.
My legions with yours.
Together we'll conquer a world beyond the wildest dreams of even Alexander.
Rome.
What was Rome when Sulla died... when Crassus lost the armies in Parthia?
These same men came after me through the streets... howling like frightened dogs,
"Caesar, save us!"
They would've made me king then.
I wouldn't let them then.
He was thrown over the wall.
It's not a pretty sight.
Titus, the moneylender.
Why should he be killed savagely and brought here?
Obviously, I am being warned.
Perhaps I am next.
They dare to threaten you?
- Caesarion. Where was my son...?
- Not far away.
It frightened him.
- Lepidus, how many legions has he now?
- Fifteen. Perhaps more.
- Where?
- Scythia.
You and I will dine with Lepidus tonight.
We'll talk of armies and battlefields and lists of men to die.
Tomorrow in the Senate, let them offer the sands of Libya as my kingdom...
I will accept.
This is great Caesar... beloved by Rome... and at least one of us... who must die so that Rome may live.
If it must be done, then let us do it unashamed and unafraid.
If the world is to know that it is Rome that will not have a king... then let us make it the honorable act of free men in the light of day.
In the light of what day, Brutus?
Tomorrow?
In the curia of the Senate?
And shall we be armed, all of us?
Decimus, come to Caesar's villa early tomorrow to escort him to the Senate.
Cimber, Marc Antony must not enter the curia with Caesar.
On a pretext, lead him aside to speak of what you heard at Lepidus' house.
I remember something odd.
At one point,
Caesar asked of each of us... what manner of death we would choose.
And Caesar, when it came to him, looked straight at me and said:
"Sudden."
Odd, isn't it?
I was afraid I'd find you still asleep.
Caesarion is.
He was awake most of the night.
Did the storm frighten him?
He said not, but it did.
I could tell.
Have you time to come in?
Decimus awaits. He came by expressly to accompany me to the Senate.
Decimus? Has he done this before?
A shrewd politician.
He hopes to benefit by arriving with me, this day of days.
Keep Antony close by.
You too?
The ladies of Rome seem to have caught each other's fears this morning.
Like a head cold.
Calpurnia pleaded with me not to go to the Senate at all.
Why? Why would she not want you to go?
Oh, the bad night. Nothing else.
She awoke screaming in her sleep.
The thunder, the lightning.
She dreamed that she saw me murdered.
That she saw me... or a statue of me covered in blood.
The servants told her of seeing men of fire in the heavens... odd happenings and so forth.
Strange birds were seen in the Forum.
One flew into the Senate carrying a sprig of laurel which it dropped... at the base of Pompey's statue.
Pompey?
- Caesar, I'm afraid.
- You must not tell me to stay away.
Shall I too be afraid?
Can it be said of Caesar, he gave up the world because of a thunderstorm?
That such divinity that was in him ran before mortal superstition?
I feel you need me now... and I cannot help you.
Then help me to live as I have lived, always differently from the rest.
The others, for whom life is merely an endless fear of dying.
Your gods... and mine go with you, Caesar.
The world, except for you, is filled with little men.
Fire burns.
The winds of destruction blow.
Rome... mighty and alone, the winds of destruction blow down upon thee!
Storms and hail shall cut down wheat... shall cut down birds and living things of earth.
The heavens... and the gods themselves.
My son!
Caesar! Caesar!
I would've come sooner.
There was much to do.
And it seems you have done it extremely well.
Is that where...?
Yes.
In Egypt, we build eternal monuments to our dead heroes.
Here, you burn them like rubbish.
Goodbye.
I've brought the 10th Legion and Rufio. You have nothing to fear.
Nothing to fear?
That's no reason for staying.
So much has happened so quickly.
Suddenly I have the pieces of a broken world to pick up:
Caesar, you running off at night like this.
Do you suggest that I stay? Why?
Don't ask me to be clear about my feelings right now. I'm tired.
And with you, it's never easy to say my meaning.
But you speak so well, Antony.
I've been told how excitingly you read Caesar's will... to the sobbing, murdering, free citizens of Rome.
Naming as his heir his great nephew, Octavian!
I knew Caesar's will and the reasons for it.
If Octavian hadn't been named... how many hours or minutes would you and your son have survived?
And if Caesar had become truly king... do you believe he would still have named Octavian?
In any case, it's over.
Caesar... and the dream that was murdered with him.
First Alexander's... then Caesar's.
Now over. Finished.
- First, Rome must be put in order.
- Rome again.
Brutus, Cassius and the others must be found and killed.
- Then?
- Then in death...
Caesar must be granted the power and title he was denied in life. Deified, even.
A dead king, a dead god.
Safe enough even for Rome.
Caesarion as Caesar's son could claim both the title of king and his deification.
And to what court of law would my son and I take our claim?
I will present it to the Roman Senate myself.
I believe you would.
And after the noble senators have stopped laughing... do my son and I then declare war on Rome?
No. For this, a Caesar would be needed.
You have very little time.
Another Caesar.
But thank you.
I shall remember your kindness to us.
- You give up too easily.
- Do I?
Let me come to Alexandria and talk more with you.
- Whenever you like.
- Now. Tonight, if I could.
In any case, try to remember.
For more than two years did Antony seek out the assassins of Caesar.
At last, at Philippi... he was able to set against them his legions and those of Octavian... who was Caesar's heir.
Cassius was the first to die... by his own hand.
Then Brutus and the others.
Hail Antony!
Hail Antony's legion!
You remember Philippi.
He won it.
My lord.
- This way.
- But my tent is this way.
Later. I'll see him later.
Octavian depresses me.
You promised.
Well, the fighting's over.
We've won it all.
Your health should improve quickly now.
Even if I die, my place is with you on the field.
- You were wrong to prevent me.
- Caesar was ill.
Caesar? Yes. I keep forgetting.
I have inherited the name.
I have made it mine.
Why not? You'll never be confused with the other one.
At least your troops fought bravely, under my command.
Agrippa has kept me fully informed.
What were you doing there?
The battle was fought on land, between men, not wood bumping on water.
Why did you bring Agrippa?
Were you expecting rain?
Shall we choose a piece of land, just you and I?
Be quiet. There are matters to talk about.
Have you an objection to Agrippa remaining?
I object to Agrippa at all times.
Lying here, indisposed... you must have had time to consider the problem.
I think it is best to continue the Triumvirate.
You and I and Lepidus.
Very well.
Lepidus shall have Africa and the islands. You, Spain and Gaul.
Rome and Italy to be administered by the three of us, jointly.
- And you?
- All the rest.
Then, with Lepidus in Africa and you in the East... bringing order to Rome and Italy will be my problem.
- So it seems.
- Spain and Gaul aren't enough.
I'll need money.
- There have been tax riots in Rome.
- So I've heard.
Done.
And done.
Would Caesar approve, do you think?
Definitely. Perhaps the veil of Isis would have bothered him a bit.
Three years... and Rome remembers him only by the image on a gold coin.
Are they those I brought back with me?
When Octavian had them struck off... it was to commemorate
Caesar's deification.
So that he could inherit Caesar's divinity together with all the rest.
Even a dead god cannot rewrite his will.
Antony did present
Caesarion's claims to the Senate.
He kept that much of his promise.
And he will keep the rest of it.
After almost three years since Caesar's death... more than a year since Philippi?
Antony will come. He will need Egypt.
Egypt is you.
That's what I meant, of course.
Antony will need me.
Finances! My head hurts when you talk of money.
Change the subject.
All right. News from Rome.
Octavian has forced Lepidus out of his command and into exile.
I wish I hadn't...
I wish I had not drunk so much today.
So do I.
Do I trouble you, Rufio?
Yes, you do.
I'll wager Caesar was never befuddled by wine. Nothing befuddled Caesar
The campaign against Parthia won't be easy.
- How many legions have we left?
- It's hard to tell.
- So many desertions.
- Desertions?
They haven't been paid in months.
You remember when we started into Greece?
I lived with them, ate with them.
I was one of them.
They seem distant to me now, as if they were a memory.
We must find the gold to pay them... the wheat to feed them, supplies, ships, armor.
And where do you suggest we look for all these?
- I thought perhaps further to the east.
- Syria?
- Perhaps more to the south.
- Ethiopia?
To the north...
- I forbid you to mention her!
- I didn't.
I won't crawl to her!
Why hasn't she offered assistance?
- She may not know.
- She knows everything.
- If only out of gratitude...
- Perhaps she'll express it in person.
Then let her come to me.
Am I so much less than Caesar?
Nor is she less than Cleopatra, queen of Egypt, and you promised...
Queen. Strip them naked, they're no longer queens.
It is also difficult to tell the rank of a naked general.
And generals without armies are naked, indeed.
All right. I'll meet her halfway.
I'll send you to her.
- You order her to come.
- If I am to order her, I need not journey.
- Then summon her.
- Even worse.
Then beg, entreat, cajole, find the word you like... pour perfume, whinny like a stallion.
But see that she comes to me.
I understand your position, Rufio.
Surely you must understand mine.
I do not intend to join that long list of queens... who have quivered happily at being summoned by Lord Antony.
But surely I didn't say "summoned."
You said "invite." He meant "summon."
In any case, I am the queen of Egypt.
And I choose to remain on Egyptian soil.
Tarsus is not the other end of the world, Your Majesty.
If it were one step from Egypt, that would be too far.
I will meet with Lord Antony... but only on Egyptian soil.
My lady, a way must be found, a time, a place to satisfy you both.
Must it, Rufio?
Cleopatra.
Cleopatra!
It is.
It must be.
She said never, except on Egyptian soil.
"Never." Something women say to begin with.
Welcome Queen Cleopatra on my behalf.
Extend my invitation to a banquet in her honor.
- Don't you think...?
- Still not convinced Rufio?
Hurry back, there's much to be done.
Have the cooks sent to me.
Forgive me, noble Rufio.
It is you who do not understand.
Queen Cleopatra, at present in her chamber, is on Egyptian territory... and intends to remain on it.
Most learned Sosigenes, forgive me... but this is Tarsus, not Alexandria.
You are on Tarsus, noble Rufio.
I am on Egypt.
Tonight and tomorrow night, if Lord
Antony desires to meet Her Majesty... he will come to her, to Egypt.
I shall do my best, learned friend, to prevail upon Lord Antony to attend.
Marc Antony, how prompt you are.
If I had not been, it would be unforgivable of me.
I had hoped to be here to welcome you as you came aboard.
If you had been, it would be unforgivable of me.
Be more tolerant.
Forgive yourself now and then.
Almost three years. Have you possibly become more beautiful?
Almost three? That long?
The time has passed so quickly.
Your necklace.
It seems to be made of gold coins.
Coins of Caesar.
- Do you find it attractive?
- Very.
And I find what you're wearing most becoming.
Greek, isn't it?
I have a fondness for almost all Greek things.
As an almost all-Greek thing,
I'm flattered.
An unusual necklace.
Nothing but gold coins of Caesar.
- How did you come by it?
- I had it made.
I wear it always.
A fabulous feast.
One is so limited when one travels by ship.
This fabulous ship... together with its queen, the fabulous Cleopatra.
The name of Marc Antony is not exactly unknown to the world.
- In the last year or so since we met...
- Almost three.
By now you have become one-third the master of Rome.
You don't permit yourself to forget him, is that it?
That's an odd way of putting it.
"Don't permit myself"?
Is it necessary to wear him around your neck?
You forget, Antony, in these almost three years... how full your own life has been.
They can't have been uneventful for you. You rule Egypt alone.
Oh, they have been busy, but not full.
There's a difference.
There cannot be enough hours in the days of a queen... and her nights have too many.
- So I fill them with memories.
- Of Caesar?
And of a dream... that almost came true.
You may remember.
I remember that night in Rome, saying it could still come true.
You said so much that night to so many.
Let me get rid of them all.
Why? I have arranged an entertainment.
A dance in the Greek fashion to welcome the god Bacchus.
If I make a great show of going, they'll have to leave too.
Then I can return... and we can talk alone, you and I.
- When would you return?
- In an hour, no more than two.
- How long would you stay?
- Until we had nothing more to say.
Are you a strong swimmer?
We sail at sunrise.
I don't understand.
Home to Alexandria, to Egypt.
You've come all this way for one night. All to make a fool of me.
Perhaps you would feel less a fool... if you stayed the night with me, is that it?
I've told you before.
With you, words do not come easily to me.
There is too much unsaid within me that I cannot say.
Then I cannot know it.
There is much unsaid within you too.
That is probably true of everybody.
Stay for a while.
I have known you so long but so little. Give me time.
Not I. Not Egypt and Rome together.
Not even the gods have time to give you.
But, Antony, use what you have.
Don't waste it by playing at god here in Tarsus... while Octavian in Rome becomes a god.
The dance, I take it, is over.
Sit up.
I want to see whether you sleep with your memories.
With so much left unsaid within you... it must be a relief to break and tear things.
- I want to say something now.
- Perhaps some other time.
Now!
Caesar.
Conquer and conquer.
Bring the world to its knees.
"You're not a Caesar.
Did you know that?"
Be braver than the bravest... stronger than the strongest.
Still no Caesar.
Caesar's done it first and better.
Ruled better, loved better, fought better.
Run where you will, you can't get out.
There's no way out.
The shadow of Caesar will cover you and cover the universe for all of time.
"Whenever you like," you said in Rome.
"Come to Alexandria whenever you like."
"Now, tonight," I said.
To bow to the throne upon which Caesar put you.
To talk of a new treaty.
Caesar's can't be improved. Copy it.
Of Caesar's son. Of the dream you shared with Caesar that still fills your life.
Alexander's design for a world to be ruled by you and Caesar.
Where is Antony?
Where is Marc Antony?
Antony the Great! The divine Antony!
Here.
He's... here.
One step behind Caesar.
At the right hand of Caesar.
In the shadow of Caesar.
Tell me, how many have loved you since him?
One? Ten? Anyone? No one?
Have they kissed you with Caesar's lips?
Is it his name you cry out in the dark?
Afterwards, has he reproached you and have you begged forgiveness?
You've come here, then, running over with wine and self-pity... to conquer Caesar.
For so long now, you've filled my life... like a great noise
I hear everywhere in my heart.
I want to be free of you, of wanting you... of being afraid.
Yet, Caesar would not permit it.
But I will never... be free of you.
From the first instant I saw you... entering Rome on that monstrous stone beast... shining in the sun... like a little gold toy.
How I envied Caesar.
Went suddenly sick with it.
Not his conquests or his triumphs.
Not his titles or the roaring of the mob.
I envied him you.
When we first met in Rome,
I remembered you.
I wondered that I could ever have forgotten.
Remembered me?
Years ago, when you were a young cavalry officer... stationed at the palace in
Alexandria under that fat Roman general.
- What was his name?
- Gabinius.
Gabinius.
I was 12 years old, and I loved you.
- Nonsense.
- It's true.
Lovers always want so much never to have loved before.
It's possible, you know.
It becomes a game.
Who loved whom first?
I did.
If you noticed me at all then, you were probably terrified of me.
With good reason. Everybody knows
Romans cut up little children... and feed them to their horses.
We'll make this our beginning.
Beginning with tonight... you must never envy Caesar... or anyone, anything again.
After all... this is nothing new.
For so many years...
Antony has fed upon the crumbs... that fell from
Julius Caesar's table.
I say... they are deserving of each other.
Let him stay in Egypt.
Let him fritter away his life as he chooses... but not the possessions and the empire of the Roman people!
The Roman people!
The Roman people. What are glory and possessions to them?
Is their Antony content?
Then so are they.
Does their Antony sweep their empire... under Cleopatra's bed?
His adoring Romans sigh and remain content.
Let him stay however distant for however long... with never a thought of them.
The Roman people hold him close to their hearts.
Distant?
Perhaps from Rome but not from Caesar, I think.
Nor from Caesar's son.
Germanicus, do you speak of me?
No, Octavian, I speak of Caesar.
I am Caesar.
Only while Antony remains... distant from Rome.
Antony!
Stay not too long in Alexandria!
Germanicus... stay not too long in Rome.
- How much of this is known to Antony?
- All of it and more.
I've written him regularly. Letters, dispatches by personal messenger.
And what has he answered?
He wrote he was no longer interested in the matters I described.
That he would not return to Rome.
That he understood quite clearly what was at stake, what he would lose.
But that he would not leave you.
Let's try the goat.
Let's have that goat again.
There. Not too much.
There.
The milk of a cow... of a goat and of an ass.
Which is best for softening the beard?
Is it true Octavian shaves but once a week?
Even then, he has merely to face the wind and let the fuzz blow away.
You knew, didn't you,
Germanicus was here from Rome?
Yes.
Have you strong feelings about beards?
I had one. Bright red.
Why haven't you seen him?
When you go... must it be for very long?
I must take some of these with me.
They don't have them.
At least, they didn't when I was last... in Rome.
While they were digging the foundation of my tomb... the workers found an old wall.
Someone had scratched on it hundreds of years ago:
"You were not here last night, and I could not sleep.
Will you be here tonight?"
Do you suppose they ever met again?
Everything that I shall ever want to hold or look upon or have or be... is here now with you.
I must not be sorry for myself.
Queens are sometimes no better at that than kings, or even princes.
It doesn't seem fair.
What I feel I should have felt long ago when I was very young.
When I could say to myself that this was how love was... and how it would be.
But to have waited so long, to know so suddenly... this late... how it hurts.
How love can stab the heart.
Be careful with Octavian.
Let him be careful with me.
The Romans want no war between the two of you.
In any case, you are not ready yet.
War? The world is filled with love.
There'll be no more wars.
You must have your share.
Your titles and powers must be spelled out exactly.
There can be no question of your complete authority in the East.
Antony, how will I live?
The same as I.
One breath upon the other.
Each bringing us... one breath closer.
You take so much of me with you so far.
Remember, remember.
They'll want you to forget.
- Please...
- Forget? How?
I can never be more far away from you... than this.
He will come first to Brindisium.
Agrippa and I plan to welcome his arrival with a great ceremony.
Antony must see how dear to the hearts of the Romans, of us all... he is and has been.
He has been away for a very long time.
Perhaps we can persuade him to stay with us even longer.
Perhaps, Octavia, if you came to Brindisium, you could help.
You may have forgotten.
It is only six months since...
Begging the pardon of Agrippa and our ancestors...
I do not agree that a young widow must retire from life.
You haven't left my house since your husband died.
If only for the sake of your health, the change alone...
Then, begging the pardon of
Lord Agrippa and our ancestors...
I would look forward very much to the change.
Nothing, no one, could possibly shine more brightly in the sun.
Not only Antony.
I know of no man who would not hold out his greedy fists for Octavia.
After all, what greater pledge could I offer... of my goodwill toward him?
And how could Antony better show his love of peace and Rome... than by accepting?
And Cleopatra?
Are you suggesting we invite her to the wedding?
You remember when
Julius Caesar returned... and those months while she was in Rome?
There was a poison in his heart, in his brain.
Yes, the falling sickness.
But more than that.
- Cleopatra.
- I remember well.
- Antony is no Caesar.
- I am grateful for that.
Granted that he marries Octavia, will he forget Cleopatra?
- Will she permit him to forget?
- Most probably not.
- Have I permission to speak?
- Tell me, quickly.
A galley came to Pelusium with news from Rome.
Antony and Octavian have sealed a great pact.
Antony has 10 more legions and all of the East for his domain.
Egypt will be declared ally of Rome.
It is done.
- There is more.
- No. No more, my lord.
- He's afraid.
- Is there anything more?
Forgive me, Divine Majesty.
There has been a marriage.
A marriage of state.
Between Octavia, the sister of Caesar... and Lord Antony.
Anything more?
They're presently in Athens.
Sometime within the year,
Lady Octavia is to return to Rome.
Antony will come Alexandria to negotiate the alliance of Rome and Egypt.
Leave me.
No.
Completely alone.
Antony!
Do you find it pleasing, my lord?
Oh, yes. Very.
It was made here in Athens.
Not as practical as our Roman ones, of course.
The Greeks have such a weakness for beauty.
Does the dinner not please you, my lord?
Very much.
I'm not particularly hungry.
If anything would please you more...
Believe me, I am pleased.
The gods know you do nothing but please me... in every way.
Word from Domitius?
He never even reached the palace.
He was not permitted through the city gate.
If I may be excused.
There's no need for you to go.
When I hear matters of state discussed by men... invariably I find myself wondering about... why the wine has gone sour.
Good night, Rufio.
Good night, my lord.
Domitius turned away at the gate.
That makes how many?
Five of your ambassadors turned away within this year.
- If you'd gone when...
- It was the only favor I ever asked of you.
You granted it.
The treaty with Egypt must be made.
We've received no wheat, no gold...
I cannot go to her to negotiate a treaty!
She'll have no one else.
And what if she should... turn me away?
That would be quite impossible.
Have you ever really left her?
No.
Three days I've waited for an audience with you alone.
What is the purpose?
Get out, all of you.
I'll see her privately.
- You're before the throne of Egypt.
- I know where I am!
State your purpose!
Matters I won't discuss publicly.
I do not grant private audiences to unidentified persons.
I am Marcus Antonius.
I know who you are.
What are you, at the moment?
Envoy of Rome, proconsul of all the Roman Empire to the east of Italy.
An impressive title.
Worthy, perhaps, of a private audience?
Without a treaty of alliance with Egypt... you could not hold the territories under your command. True?
Possibly.
Then, Lord Antony, you come before me as a suppliant.
- If you choose to regard me as such.
- I do.
You will therefore assume the position of a suppliant before this throne.
You will kneel.
- I will what?
- On your knees.
You dare ask the proconsul of the Roman Empire...
I asked it of Julius Caesar.
I demand it of you!
Now... you may have the treaty you asked for... on the following conditions:
By your authority as proconsul of Rome... you will cede to Egypt immediately the following territories:
Judea, Jordan, Armenia, Phoenicia, the provinces of Sinai and Arabia... the islands of Cyprus and Crete.
You ask for one-third of the Roman Empire!
Put it another way.
I give to you two-thirds.
Most generous.
I cannot accept.
I suggest you deliberate further.
Perhaps consult with your superior in Rome.
My superior?
Octavian.
Caesar Octavian?
You have not been dismissed!
You are now dismissed.
Outside, all of you. Her Majesty and I will speak in private.
Out! Before I chop you up and feed you to my horses.
That's how Romans frighten little girls.
They like to frighten little girls.
Wait outside.
I married Octavia at her brother's insistence... as a gesture of faith, of peace.
A bargain sealed.
With a kiss? Or did you simply shake hands on your wedding night?
Rome was celebrating the marriage even before I arrived. How could I refuse?
By saying no.
As you have said no to all my demands.
They're unreasonable! The kind laid down for a helpless enemy!
You're not helpless... yet.
I can't cede the territories. It would lead to a break between Rome and me.
Why do you think
I asked for them?
It would be playing into
Octavian's hands, what he hopes for.
It would not be wise!
What is wise?
To hand over Rome, Italy, the world to Octavian?
To grovel publicly before his authority?
Take his sister to wed and to bed.
As if to beg forgiveness... for having stayed so long with your Egyptian harlot.
What has angered you?
That I dealt with Octavian how I could... or that I married his sister to do it?
Jealousy or politics? Which?
Both! And damn you for not understanding either.
I wouldn't look to you for instruction.
Which is why you have come back chained to Octavian like a slave.
- Slave!
- And with such exquisite chains.
So softly spoken, so virtuous.
She sleeps, I hear, fully clothed.
I come back.
That's all that should concern you.
Should it?
How long before your master snaps his finger and you run back to him, or her?
I have only one master.
My love for you.
No.
Your master must not be love.
Never love.
Give yourself to love and you give yourself to forgetfulness... of what you are and who you are and what you want.
And what you want is worth so much more?
I will not have love as my master.
- Then you will not have love.
- Nor will I have Octavian.
- Never fear.
- How confident you are.
And has Octavian a master?
His ambition: to rule the Roman world as emperor and god.
The Roman world, to begin with.
And what stands in his way?
- You and I.
- And my son!
The rightful heir to the name and glory of great Caesar.
Octavian has already stolen those and he will now destroy... in the name of his sister, the love Rome has for you.
And by your marriage to her... he has made of me, unmistakably, your whore.
Never fear Octavian?
It is he, now, who I think must be unafraid.
Show me a city and I'll tell you how to take it.
I'll find an army's weak points and hit them hard where they are.
But make me to sit down and talk in whispers of this and that... with an emphasis here and a shrug there, and I'm soon confounded and defeated.
Meaning to do the best...
I suppose I could not have done worse.
There is still time.
Let someone ask me what I want:
To live with you in peace and love.
Do you have... conditions for total surrender?
First, as did Caesar... you will marry me according to Egyptian ritual.
That's not a condition, that's a reward.
You'll declare, by your authority...
Caesarion to be king of Egypt... and we will rule together in his name.
Happily granted.
You will cede to Egypt all the territories I have demanded.
You must.
If only to assert your own authority and power.
Otherwise, inevitably, in time we will lose everything.
Can't you see that?
I can see nothing... but you.
I am no longer content to forgive Antony!
To marry this Egyptian according to their barbaric rites!
Meaningless under Roman law!
Great Caesar himself...
Yes. Bit by bit,
Antony crawls behind his memory.
But tell us this, Germanicus:
Did great Caesar also toss one-third of the Roman Empire... into Cleopatra's undoubtedly deserving lap?
The territories in dispute were subjugated by Julius Caesar.
The right to rule over them is the heritage of his son.
And in the name of the mighty Caesar
I grant to King Ptolemy Caesarion... that right.
Let it be known the greatness of Rome lies not in what she takes... but in what she gives.
"Rome's greatness lies in what she gives," he says.
Then calmly gives what is not his.
And Cleopatra takes... and will take more.
And war will come.
She knows and I know... that war will come.
But I will not speak for it... nor will I speak against Antony.
I must be forced into war.
The people of Rome must force this war upon me.
They must storm the doors of the Senate, crying for it.
If we move quickly, the Romans won't know we've crossed the Mediterranean... until we land in Greece.
You and General Rufio will start embarking the troops at once.
Yes, Your Majesty.
If it is decided to move our armies into Greece.
It has been decided.
My men do not... travel well by sea.
They fight on land.
They move on land.
Your men will do as they are told, as mine will.
My men will do as they're told by me.
They have not yet become...
They are still Roman.
However... since I do as I'm told...
The final decision will, of course, be Lord Antony's.
And I'm sure that in time he will make it.
That is all.
It would be wiser not to disagree in the presence of our officers.
Your officers.
What final decision have you decided I am to make?
Why do you oppose transporting our armies to Greece?
Because I do not want war against Rome.
One hundred thousand men led by Marc Antony.
Octavian is no fool. He won't fight.
He'll have to, instantly, on the spot where they land.
Rome will not declare war against you.
I do not agree.
I have not asked for your opinion.
Not for some time.
Not since I doubted the necessity of building 300 ships.
The way to prevent war is to be ready for it.
Have 300 warships ever been built for war without war?
We shall have what we want without it.
Your Majesty, please hear me.
I think we are very near the edge.
Strings are being pulled, and not by us.
We are being managed and maneuvered without our choosing.
The deputation sent on behalf of Lady Octavia... chosen from the most highly revered men of Rome.
Why? They can take back to their people nothing but Lord Antony's... forgive me, insulting and unnecessary divorce of her... and his rejection of them.
It was done at my bidding.
The responsibility is mine.
The doing was mine.
What do you propose?
Let me go to Rome and approach
Octavian, possibly the Roman people... and assure them that we want peace.
Go then.
Go to Rome.
Sosigenes!
Take care.
He's very dear to you, that old man.
Your concern and worry are written all over you.
Forgive me, but it's a kind of love that you're showing.
Let them talk. Let them negotiate all they want.
Time is on our side.
We can only grow stronger.
These walls must not believe their ears... to hear such silence... from the right... from the left.
The call of the Roman people can be clearly heard... yet the Roman Senate... has no answer.
Shall we then just sit... and listen?
There is not one of us that would not willingly make war upon Cleopatra.
But how... without also making war upon Marc Antony... loved by Rome and loving Rome?
"Loved by Rome and loving Rome."
I have here the last will and testament... of Antony, who so loves Rome.
Read for yourselves... how dearly Antony loves you, loves Rome... in this, his last will under his seal.
Only lately brought from Egypt... and deposited in our holy temple at Antony's request... by the distinguished Sosigenes.
An extraordinary mission for an extraordinary man.
So wise, so close to Cleopatra, so trusted by her.
Read in Antony's will... at the end.
Commit to memory the last request of your beloved Antony.
It bears witness to his love for Rome.
When he is dead, it says... when Marc Antony has died... it is his wish to be buried... in his beloved Alexandria!
In Egypt!
Among Egyptians.
Beside his Egyptian whore!
Is what I say the truth?
Do I speak the truth?
- War!
- War!
War! War! War!
I hold before you the Golden Spear of War.
Placed into my hands without dissent... by the command and will of the Senate of Rome.
And now it is you, the people of Rome, who must direct me.
Where is the enemy?
Where is Egypt? Show me the way!
No!
There!
There is Egypt.
And so once more, the Romans warred upon each other.
And just as Antony had foretold... the forces of Octavian came to meet them... on the spot where they landed... which was at Actium, in Greece.
Action begins with the rise of the sun.
Your plan is brave and simple.
It's possible on land... but we debate its wisdom upon the sea.
I have an enemy on land with fewer troops, on sea with fewer ships.
Let him debate the wisdom of his position.
I have a happy choice. To destroy him wet or dry. I have chosen wet.
I think it best, Euphranor, you report to Cleopatra aboard her vessel in the harbor.
There you may point out to her... the reasons why my brave simplicity has failed.
In any case, you are relieved of your battle command.
This final commitment of yourself, your ships, of all of us... to fight at sea, when did you decide?
- Forgive me. I had...
- We've worked hard for many months.
We've trained an army of 200,000 men from 20 countries.
- They won't be wasted...
- Of which, tonight, 20,000 of them... will be herded onto those ships and dragged out to sea, puking and afraid.
- Why, my lord? Why?
- Because I have decided it will be so!
I consider it an honor... to fight beside Lord Antony at any time, anywhere.
Spoken like a Roman, Ramos.
And you shall fight at my side, in Rufio's place.
Rufio, you will remain with
Her Majesty aboard her vessel.
As you command.
Canidius, you will remain with the land forces... cheering from the hilltop, if you like.
- As you command.
- Exactly.
As I command.
You're all dismissed.
Antony.
What has happened?
To me?
You have happened to me.
Do the lookouts have
Octavian's insignia?
- A golden eagle. Sighted at sunrise.
- By sunset we'll have those gold feathers.
Let Octavian know we're coming!
Let the enemy hear the voice of Antony's legions!
He's on his way.
Signal my lord Caesar's ship.
Does it fly his insignia?
My orders are to be followed exactly as issued.
And may the gods grant that Antony has not changed his plan of battle.
There he goes... as he's done 100 times on land.
Straight for the center.
If only it were on land, and we were there to protect his flanks.
But we're not.
This and all dispositions are to be signaled... to Admiral Euphranor aboard Cleopatra's barge.
But Euphranor's in command of...
In command of moving toy ships on a painted ocean... so that Egypt's queen can more clearly follow her war upon water... to which she has committed
Marc Antony and 20,000 Romans.
Just as he said he would.
Antony and his escorts, by themselves, are after Octavian.
- He's already broken through their center.
- They let him through.
They Roman line will close behind him.
Not if we engage, as Antony said.
They won't engage. Agrippa will pull them back and back, behind Antony... as Antony chases Octavian.
What report?
Lord Antony is already through the center of the Roman line.
He is now deep within the Roman fleet, in pursuit of Octavian.
Faster! Faster!
They've increased their own speed.
We're too heavy to catch them.
Then we'll slow them down.
Start the ballistas.
Javelin throwers.
Aim high.
Overshoot rather than under.
Ballistas. Javelins.
Ballistas!
Octavian's ships are so much faster than our Egyptian tubs.
Why doesn't Agrippa keep him away from Antony's ballistas?
Ballistas!
Ballista!
My lord! My lord!
A direct hit on the enemy!
A bank of oars has been destroyed!
He's coming around broadside.
We've got him!
Collision course.
We'll ram him, board and destroy him.
Octavian!
Octavian!
Now is your time to be a Caesar!
- Where is he hiding?
- My Lord Octavian is not on board.
And now we close the trap.
Now we hit my Lord Antony with everything we have.
No word of Lord Antony?
By now he must have Octavian.
You said he rammed Octavian's ship.
It may be Lord Antony rammed a ship flying Octavian's insignia.
But if it is Octavian's ship, if Octavian is on board...
If he finds and kills Octavian, he's still surrounded by the Roman fleet.
- Then send him help.
- I've none to send.
They're pulling our ships apart now.
They've got Antony alone and cut off... closing in on him like a pack of dogs on a wounded bear.
- Lord Antony's ship?
- Gone.
- And Octavian's ship?
- Burning, helpless.
Would you say, admiral... that Lord Antony is dead?
How is the wind for Egypt?
Fair.
We'll sail at once.
Man the oar banks. Hoist anchor.
We sail for Egypt!
My Lord Canidius!
Remember always, that after the battle of Actium... with Octavian dead and Antony dead... you saw the victor... sail away on her golden barge.
She's going.
Cleopatra's going!
Leaving me!
My lord.
My lord, our casualties are heavy.
We have little armor left.
Our men need regrouping, someone to give them courage.
The dying are calling for you.
The living need your help.
You can't leave them.
Listen to me!
Help!
Caesar, news!
Great news! Cleopatra is leaving the battle. Antony is following her.
We have won a great victory.
Weigh oars!
Her Majesty is most anxious to see you. Will you come below?
Perhaps if you wish to remain here, she will come to you.
Shall I send you food? Wine?
Her Majesty's orders.
She's afraid you might... harm yourself.
Please.
Octavian has crossed from Syria into Egypt.
He can be here in a matter of weeks.
There are two full legions here in Alexandria... who have remained loyal to you.
They and their officers... are waiting for you to command them.
If not to me, won't you speak to Rufio at least... or to anyone you choose?
Antony, just say what you want done and it will be.
It's been so long since you've looked at me. Don't turn away... even like this... with your eyes filled with hate.
How they burn with hate.
Why, Antony? Why?
Because I ran away?
They told me you were dead!
What... could I do?
Where could I go... in a world suddenly without you... except to my son and my country...
Caesarion and Egypt?
I wanted to save them from Octavian.
You would have wanted me to go.
You would have commanded me to go.
Tell me you would have!
They told me you were dead.
You were quite right.
I am dead.
The armies of Gaius Julius Caesar... are advancing without opposition upon Alexandria.
Gaius Julius Caesar?
So now Octavian has stolen all of the name.
Caesar wishes it known he has no quarrel with Cleopatra of Egypt.
Then let him take his armies out of here and go home.
He has charged me to say that the choice of war or peace... now rests with Egypt.
And that for himself, he desires only peace.
And what are his terms for this unconditional peace?
A small token.
A demonstration. A gesture.
An indication of Queen Cleopatra's goodwill and good faith.
What does Octavian want?
Marc Antony.
The... head of Marc Antony?
Take this to him as my answer.
Egyptian generosity.
Octavian may have two heads for the price of one.
Either two... or none.
I'm told you come here to sleep.
Not to sleep.
To pass the night then.
I'm not alone.
The old boy and I exchange memories of life.
It's like having a roommate, or should I say, "tomb-mate"?
If he were in your place, would I find Caesar here?
Hidden away, wrapped in moonlight and endless self-pity?
Self-pity again! You repeat yourself!
Find new reproaches!
Until now it has just been a part of your being drunk.
Singing sad songs for Antony.
Your time would be better spent negotiating with Octavian.
Why did you not give my head to Agrippa?
It's no great loss to me.
Dying the second time is painless and possibly an advantage to you.
The basis, perhaps, of a great new alliance with Rome.
I do not want a great new alliance with Rome.
What do you want?
I have come for Marc Antony.
What is left of his army,
Rufio, my son and I... all of Egypt are waiting for him.
There is little time.
Marc Antony?
There is no one here by that name... alive.
Time for what?
For Marc Antony to appear in shiny armor... swords flashing in both hands?
Agrippa. Octavian.
Stand back! Rejoice!
Marc Antony will save the day!
Antony, you say?
He died at Actium... running away.
He tried to run on the water, the story goes... but you weren't there to hold his hand!
Rufio, my legions, waiting.
For what?
To ask me what they carry in their eyes... in their hearts, in their sleep, as I have in mine.
Why are you not dead?
Why do you live? How can you live?
Why do you not lie in the deepest hole of the sea... bloodless and bloated and at peace with honorable death?
You begged forgiveness from me for running away.
You wept and gave your reason. A mother to her child, a queen to her country.
Where and how can I weep and beg?
From whom?
The thousands and thousands who can no longer hear me?
Shall I give my reason?
Shall I say simply, I loved?
When I saw you go, I saw nothing.
Felt, heard, thought nothing except your going.
Not the dying and dead, not Rome, not Egypt... not victory or defeat, honor or disgrace... only that my love was going and I must be with her.
That my love, my master, called.
And I followed.
And that only then...
I looked back... and I saw.
How right you were.
"Have as your master anyone, anything... but never love."
How wrong.
How wrong I was.
Antony, the love you followed is here.
To be had upon payment of an empire.
Without you, Antony... this is not a world
I want to live in... much less conquer.
Because for me... there would be no love anywhere.
Do you want me to die with you?
I will.
Or do you want me to live with you?
Whatever you choose.
Are we too late, do you think, if we choose to live?
Better too late... than never.
My lady, there is disturbing news from the city.
The people are frightened. Some are beginning to leave their homes.
During the night, hundreds of notices were secretly posted everywhere.
They were found stuck up in the marketplace.
Even painted on temples and other holy places.
Signed by Octavian Gaius
Julius Caesar Augustus... promising the Egyptian people peace if they surrender to him... and destruction if they do not.
I've had all of the notices removed and I've ordered the death penalty... for anyone who spreads the false rumors that Antony's men might desert him.
And what penalty if the rumors might come true?
How do you know?
I know the Romans.
There is only one commander they will never desert.
His name is "Victory."
But yet, just now, you let Lord Antony go as if...
If you could have seen him, how proud he was... unafraid... as he used to be.
All of my attendants, have they been given their freedom? Have they gone?
Yes. They wanted once more to tidy up.
Octavian can do his own housecleaning.
The captain of the guards and three of his best men are to report to me... disguised as merchants.
They are to escort
Caesarion out of Egypt... for the time being.
And you?
Your Majesty, please reconsider.
There are two of Euphranor's ships, very fast, in the east harbor.
And would you roll me on board in a carpet?
No.
There are no more Caesars to go to, at least not for me.
- Then it is still your intention...
- To remain in Alexandria.
In the last possible place anyone would look.
Literally, the last possible place.
Your Majesty, I have never questioned your decisions.
This is not the time to begin.
Let me stay with you.
Charmian and Eiras will look after me.
If Lord Antony should...
When Lord Antony returns... you will be here to tell him where to find me... waiting for him.
Together, we will then do... what he thinks best.
Is that clear?
- Yes, my lady.
- Was there anything more?
I have always loved you.
And I have always known.
Rome has never known such an army.
We should be taking on all of Asia.
It seems a waste to slaughter what's left of Antony's army and Antony.
There will be no slaughter.
I doubt there will be even bloodshed.
Has a battle ever been won without a blow being struck? I wonder.
At any rate, let me make it clear once more.
I want Antony alive, and I want her alive.
She must be taken alive.
Queen Cleopatra's second procession into Rome... will surpass her first.
The ring your father gave you.
It is yours now... to keep.
Wear it with pride and with honor.
I'm afraid.
I know I shouldn't be.
Who told you that?
All kings... and especially queens, are afraid.
They just manage not to show it.
Something ordinary people cannot do.
Hail Antony!
- How near is Octavian?
- Very near. Over that low ridge.
As it grows darker, the glow from his campfires will light up the sky.
Our troops must find it attractive to watch.
Inviting, even.
Antony's legions warm themselves at their own fires.
Yes.
I could feel the warmth as I rode by.
- How many legions has he?
- Twenty.
- And we?
- Two. The 12th and one made up...
Made up from what was left of the others.
As I remember it, Caesar held Alexandria with two.
How are they deployed? Rufio.
Cavalry to the left, cavalry to the right, infantry to the center.
Three elephants deployed to stamp out a fly.
My lords Octavian and Agrippa have all the strategic brilliance... of two vestal virgins.
We can draw back here to softer ground... too soft for cavalry and make our stand against their infantry.
Stand? And let them stamp on us?
No. Let the elephants stand.
We flies will bite and buzz and tickle.
At the first light of day... while Octavian's glow still lights up the sky... we will attack.
By sunset, both our loyal legions will have grown larger... and even more loyal, I promise you.
Good night.
Rufio, tell the guards, please...
I am to be awakened just before dawn.
Of course.
And, Rufio... if, for whatever reason, the guards should forget or misjudge the time... will you, yourself, wake me?
The guards will wake you.
- But if they don't?
- Then I will. Never fear.
I never fear.
Not anymore.
Rufio!
Rufio.
Fight!
Why don't you fight?
Is there no one who would grant Antony... an honorable way to die?
Before me... this was carried by another Roman killed by Rome.
Another...
Caesar.
No.
We will have him.
We will have them both together.
Where is she?
Her Majesty said to tell you... she can be found in the last possible place anyone would look.
Literally, the last possible place.
She might have waited.
Once more, it seems...
Cleopatra is out of reach... and I must hurry after.
Throughout life... and now beyond.
One woman, one love!
Nothing changes... except life into death.
Will you help me?
Help me to die, Apollodorus!
I want to!
But I can't.
I've always envied Rufio... his long arms.
The ultimate desertion:
I from myself.
Else, how could I have missed what
I must have aimed for all my life?
Will you finish me now?
Where is my sword?
I beg you to finish me.
I lied to you.
I let you think the queen is dead.
But she's alive in her tomb, waiting for you.
Cleopatra waiting?
There will be just enough time... if you'll help me.
Perhaps, my lady, if we were to bind his wounds tightly...
It would only give him pain.
Let him sleep.
Sleep.
Will you come tonight... so that I can sleep?
The dark sleep.
They did meet after all... the lovers.
They will always meet.
Be lonely for me.
But not for very long.
I promise.
I thought always I would die... so well... as becomes a soldier.
A soldier's death.
I lived always as I saw fit.
Unfittingly.
I would make it up, I thought, in death.
I expected...
I expected too much of me in death... as in life.
Are you holding me?
Never so closely.
Even closer.
You and I will prove death... so much less than love.
You and I, we will...
We'll make of dying... nothing more than one... last... embrace.
A kiss... to take my breath away.
There has never been... such a silence.
Turn him over.
Strange people.
Poisons that smell like perfume.
Find more. Have it analyzed.
Test it on one of the badly wounded.
My lord, they have found Queen Cleopatra.
She is locked in a building, that is to say, a tomb.
Hurry.
Oh, Marc Antony is with her, they say. He's dead.
- What?
- Lord Antony is dead.
Is that how one says it?
As simply as that.
Marc Antony is dead.
Lord Antony is dead.
The soup is hot. The soup is cold.
Antony is living. Antony is dead.
Shake with terror when such words pass your lips... for fear they be untrue and Antony cut out your tongue for the lie!
And if true... for your lifetime boast... that you were honored to speak his name even in death.
The dying of such a man... must be shouted.
Screamed.
It must echo back from the corners of the universe.
Antony is dead!
Marc Antony of Rome lives no more!
You needn't lower your head before Caesar.
I never did.
But if he were here, I'd be happy to.
I am Caesar.
If it pleases you, Octavian.
Look at me.
If it pleases you.
After all this time and all that has happened...
I suppose you are still beautiful, in a way.
You flatter me.
My interest is impersonal.
Should you have any intention...
Now you flatter yourself.
The fighting is over.
Your country, your possessions and you are mine by right of conquest.
I will permit you to rule Egypt as a Roman province and return your possessions.
There is one condition.
You will first accompany me to Rome.
Behind your chariot?
Look at me!
Would the proud citizens of Rome wait for hours in the hot sun... to see my dead body dragged through the Forum?
I'll have you closely watched.
Octavian... when I am ready to die...
I will die.
What if I promise no harm will come to you... that you will be returned safely to Alexandria?
Look at me!
What more could you ask?
You have not spoken... of my son.
Your son. I'd forgotten him.
Where is he?
Safe.
If I go with you to Rome... would you permit my son to rule Egypt?
And his sons?
And theirs?
I'll do everything I can.
Do I have your word... as a Roman emperor and god?
Yes.
When will you require me to go?
As soon as possible.
At the moment, I am very tired and would like to rest.
If you'll leave me now.
Do I have your word... that you will not harm yourself in any way?
I swear it.
On the life of my son.
Must the guards remain inside?
I have sworn... after all... on the life of my son.
And now I must make ready to go.
There's little to do.
First, I shall want something to eat.
Something to sustain me on my way.
Some fruit, perhaps?
Bring it to me.
Charmian.
You then, Eiras.
You have never been without us.
You cannot leave us behind.
Perhaps... there may be enough for us all.
Bring me a tablet to write on.
I want a message brought to Octavian.
Words are wasted on such a man.
I have wasted so many on so many men.
A few more. One last request.
Will he grant it, do you think?
I may never know.
In this case...
I think I shall.
I will serve Her Majesty as always.
I have always served her.
You will both wait... to dress me for my travels.
I will wear...
I want to be as Antony first saw me.
The dress of gold?
He must know at once... even from a great distance... that it is I.
This will be the last thing you do.
Drop this to one of the guards outside for Octavian.
But be sure to wait.
And now let me see if the figs are as they should be.
The taste of these, they say, is sharp... and swiftly over.
How strangely awake I feel.
As if living had been just a long dream.
Someone else's dream.
Now finished at last.
But then now... will begin... a dream of my own... which will never end.
Antony?
Antony, wait.
From the Egyptian queen, a message for Caesar.
Read it. Whatever she wants will be granted upon her arrival in Rome.
We will discuss it as she walks beside my chariot.
What is it?
"My one wish, which I implore you to grant..." is to be buried at the site of
Antony and to remain there...
"...until all things end."
Was this well done of your lady?
Extremely well.
As befitting... the last of so many noble... rulers.
And the Roman asked:
"Was this well done of your lady?"
And the servant answered:
"Extremely well."
As befitting the last...
"...of so many noble rulers."
Our hero grew apace.
A country lad, far happier in the woods than in the study.
A bad hero, it may be, with many a weakness.
But then, if Adam hadn't had such a weakness for apples, there would be nobody to tell Tom's story at all.
And a part of that story tells of the sport Tom found in the woods.
Ah, Tom.
You wicked dog.
Molly. What are you doing here?
I 'eard Father tell Mother you was coming.
It's a good night to be abroad and looking for game.
Ah, Tom...
Oh, Tom...
It shall be our custom to leave such scenes where taste, decorum and the censor dictate.
In this way, we shall try to make up for our incorrigible hero.
As soon as he had left the disreputable Molly, what did he do but join her equally disreputable father, Black George, gamekeeper to Squire Allworthy.
- Come on!
- I hear 'em. Psst.
Come on, lads. We'll smoke 'em out.
Fetch it. Fetch it, boy. Come on.
Wait. That's fallen on Squire Western's ground.
Well, let's after it.
No - I've been warned for trespassing.
It's our bird. Don't worry, Blackie.
- Come back! Come...
- Here, boy. Here, boy. Here, boy.
All right, you devils, I'll get you!
- I'll have your blood! I'll...
- Run, Blackie!
Let's give the old man a run for his money.
Home, lads. I'll get 'em another night.
- I thought I'd lost you in the woods.
- Short cut.
- We'll be caught one of these days.
- Don't worry.
It's all right for you - you haven't got a family to keep.
I'll look after you.
Here... Take this guinea.
Good night, Blackie.
Our hero, alas, was always being exploited by villains like Black George.
For a generous man is merely a fool in the eyes of a thief.
- A sheep?
- Aye, sir, an entire sheep.
A fat animal. Enough to feed a village for a week.
Hanging up in his cottage as proud as a battle trophy.
- This is a grave matter.
- A hanging matter.
- Sir, if I may speak on his behalf, I'd...
- Be silent.
Are you guilty?
I am... guilty...
- Sir, forgive him.
- Be quiet, sir. I have to do justice here.
You have committed a capital crime.
The laws have provided the most terrible penalty: To hang by your neck.
But you have children.
For their sake, I shall only dismiss you from my service.
And may God have mercy on you.
You're too lenient, Mr Allworthy.
Compassion is one thing, sir, but justice is another.
Mr Thwackum and Mr Square were Tom's tutors.
Over the years, they tried - with little success - to thrash into Tom a sense of virtue and religion.
They had, however, a more apt pupil.
Soon after Tom had been found, the squire's sister Bridget married a Captain Blifil, and they had a son.
This young man was quite different from Tom.
He was sober, discreet and pious beyond his age, and the whole neighbourhood resounded in his praise.
You have only taught Tom to laugh at whatever is decent and virtuous and right.
- I've taught him religion.
- Mr Thwackum, the word "religion" is as vague and uncertain as any in the English language.
By "religion" I mean the Christian religion.
Not only that, but the Protestant religion.
And not only that, but the Church of England.
I fear that Tom is the embodiment of the old truth that foundlings should be left to the parish.
My dear tutors, I'm afraid neither of you can touch his bastard's heart.
Neither indeed.
But there was another who could.
Tom...
- I want you to help me.
- How?
I want you to get me a post, Tom.
Mm-hm...
Miss Western's come back from France and'll be wantin' a maid.
I'll speak to her.
Tom, you are kind to me.
Miss Western's maid!
Sophie Western! Miss Western!
Why, Tom Jones!
I've brought you a thrush.
He's beautiful, Tom. How kind of you.
Two years is a long time. Did they teach you London ways, make a lady of you?
Most of the time I was in France.
My aunt took me there.
- Did you like France, Meez Western?
- Mais oui. Je me suis tres bien amusee.
- Ah, bon.
- You haven't changed, Tom.
You've grown, Sophie.
Grown more beautiful than ever.
Doesn't he sing beautifully?
I shall teach him some new songs.
I doubt if an English bird can learn French songs.
You'll see.
Avignon
Sur le pont d'Avignon...
We're asked to supper. I came early to ask if you'd help Black George's daughter.
Oh, yes. He stole a sheep, didn't he?
Black George is a poor man.
With big, hungry daughters to feed.
Most hungry - I can vouch for it.
I have a maid already.
But I'll see what I can do.
Good, good.
Ah! Welcome, neighbours! Welcome!
- How nice to see you.
- Welcome, madam. Welcome, Squire.
Good day, Western, good day.
- Look! Tom brought me a thrush!
- What a sweet little bird!
His song is sweeter than any tune of Mr Handel's.
Ugh, Handel!
Tom, thank you.
Welcome home, Sophie.
How lovely you're looking, child.
Aye, it's good to have her home.
Let's all go in to dinner.
- Oh dear.
- Oh, my little bird!
Don't worry, Sophie,
I'll get it back for you.
- Tom...
- Good lad, Tom.
Be careful, Tom! Tom, take care!
- I'll wager he gets it.
- Take care.
I am sorry to cause you this distress,
Miss Western.
I did not think the bird would fly away.
But I cannot help observing that the idea of caged birds is against the laws of nature.
Don't you agree, Mr Square?
He's got him!
Argh!
He'll drown! Quick, pick him up!
Help him, someone!
- Oh, Tom, you're soaked!
- Come on, lad, give me your hand.
Damn me if I won't love the boy for this as long as I have to live!
Serves him right.
And you, sir.
The weeks passed... and Molly grew apace too.
Ah, you lazy slut, you!
Look at her, with that great belly on her!
That I should have lived to see this day!
You'd better have minded what the parson said and not harkened after menfolks.
She's the first of this family to be a whore!
Mother, you yourself was brought to bed with sister there a week after you married.
Ah, but I were made an honest woman of.
But you, you have to be doing with gentlemen, don't you, you nasty slut, you!
You will have a bastard!
And I defy anybody to say that of me.
- My gentlemen'll look after me.
- Your gentlemen! Far from gentlemen!
You lay off me, or I'll tell my gentlemen...
...if these be constantly applied,
And then, though we cannot absolutely promise success, yet we may properly say with the apostle
"What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?"
And now, my dear brethren, let us sing together the hymn
"O God, Our Help in Ages Past."
O God, our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come...
"Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
For God hath made them so."
"Let bears and lions growl and fight,
For 'tis their nature too."
"But, ladies, you should never let
Such angry passions rise."
"Your little hands were never made
To tear each other's eyes."
There she is! Let's get at her!
Let's thrash her!
Don't want the likes of her in this village!
Won't have her mixing with us good folk!
Take that, you hussy!
I'll get you, Goody Brown, you dirty old harridan!
Oh, Tom... Please, Tom...
Don't... Don't leave me, Tom.
Slowly. Slowly.
That filthy slut.
Ah, good boy, good boy!
He's a game lad, your Tom.
So, the wench is having a bastard?
Yes. It seems the girl has refused to name the father to Mr Allworthy.
He may have to send her to Bridewell.
- Father, I have a headache.
- I smoke it.
I smoke it!
Tom is the father of that bastard!
Aye! As sure as tuppence,
Tom is the bastard's father!
Father...
Odds zodikins!
What a little whoremaster that boy is!
The girl is ruined, surely.
Aye! Ruined. Ruined for sure!
Once broken, never mended, eh?
Lt'll do no harm. Ask Sophie.
She knows about Tom.
You have no worse opinion of a young fellow for getting a bastard, have you?
Will you stop bobbing up and down, girl!
No, no. The women will like him the better for it, won't they?
- Sophie, sing us one of your jolly songs.
- Not tonight, Father. I have a headache.
Let's have "St George, He Was for England" or "Bobbing Joan".
That's a good song for tonight, eh?
None of your old Handel now, my little darling.
Ah, you play like an angel.
Molly's reputation was destroyed, and Tom's heart was heavy with remorse.
Perhaps Mr Square had been right, that the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands.
Oh. Mr Jones.
- Where's Molly?
- Oh, she... she ain't home.
She's upstairs. In bed.
- Who is it?
- It's me. Tom.
Why haven't you been to see me before this, Tom?
- Molly, I...
- Agh!
- You said you'd be my gentleman!
- I hope to explain why...
You'll not admit you've had your wicked will of me?!
- Molly...
- No.
I shall never love another man but you, Tom.
Not if the greatest squire in the country came a-courtin',
I couldn't give myself to him!
No, Tom, not for all the riches in the world, now that you've gained my heart.
You are a lecherous rascal after all, Tom!
I shall always hate and despise the whole sex on account of you, Tom!
Mr Square.
Molly's favours, after all, had not been bestowed on Tom alone.
Our hero, unlike many other men, was fortunate enough to discover the father of his child in time.
And after everyone's kindness, too.
She has laid the child at young Mr Jones's door.
All the parish say Mr Allworthy is so angry with Mr Jones that he won't see him.
To be sure, one can't help pitying the poor young man.
He's so pretty a gentleman. I should be sorry to see him turned out-of-doors.
Why do you tell me all this? What concern have I in what Mr Jones does?
Why, ma'am, I never thought it was any harm to say a young man was handsome.
But I shall never think of him any more now. For handsome is as handsome does.
Tittle-tattle, tittle-tattle.
I shall be late for the hunt.
Sorry, I'm sure, madam.
Everyone in my household!
Where's the cider?
Greetings! Greetings!
- Greetings, Thwackum.
- Morning, Squire. Morning, Miss Western.
Welcome, everyone.
Morning, Western.
Oh, you brute!
- Morning.
- And you, sir.
Ah, you're getting no younger.
I mean the horse, madam.
A stirrup cup, everyone!
Come, help yourselves, everyone!
Plenty to eat and drink!
Here. The Church is always first with the bread and wine.
Health to everyone!
French miss isn't speaking today?
Drink up, everyone.
- Huntsmen, loose the hounds.
- Another tankard, please.
Come on, boys and girls!
Come on, come on!
Have a drop of cider inside you, boy.
Then you'll be ready for the kill.
Come on, drink up. Drink up, everyone.
Come on, drink up!
Some Western brew for you, my girl!
Squire, it's too early! You'll tire yourself!
Quiet, everyone.
Good health and good hunting!
Come on, Sophie! Hurry, hurry!
Come on, sweetheart! After him!
Tally-ho!
Ahhh! Here he is!
- I trust you're not harmed.
- No, no. How can I ever thank you?
If I have preserved you, madam,
I am sufficiently repaid. Agh...
I hope you're not hurt.
If I have broken my arm, it is a trifle compared to my fears on your account.
Broken your arm?!
I'm afraid I have, madam.
Yet I have another to lead you home.
Look at him, ma'am. He's the most handsome man I ever saw in my life.
Why, Honor, I do believe you're in love with him.
I assure you, ma'am, I'm not.
If you were, I see no reason that you should be ashamed of it.
For he is certainly a handsome fellow.
That he is - the most handsome man
I ever saw in my life.
And, as you say, ma'am, I don't know why
I should be ashamed of looking at him, even though he is my better.
For gentlefolk are but flesh and blood, like us servants.
I am an honest person's child, and my mother and father were married - which is more than some people can say.
Honor!
My grandfather was a clergyman, and he'd have been very angry to have thought any of his family had taken up with Molly Seagrim's leavings.
Why, ma'am, the young gentleman is awake.
Yes. You've awakened him with your foolish chatter.
I feel awake for the first time, madam.
"...after narrow scru... narrow scrutiny, found some magical books..." Ha-haar!
"...several vials of strange liquors, pots of ointment..."
Remember that picnic, Sister, last year, when Western sat on a wasps' nest?
I shall never forget it!
Oh, it's so beautiful this summer.
Brother... Brother...
- Brother!
- Whoa! Whoa!
- I can't...
- It's all right. It's all right.
Why the long face, Blif?
- Such a terrible thing.
- What's happened?
There's been an accident.
My mother is dead.
Blif...
And Squire Allworthy?
He's not expected to live.
Shh.
Fever has developed and there is little hope. We can only pray.
Something for which you have scant relish!
"Forasmuch as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear sister here departed, we therefore commit her body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."
Well, there's another one gone.
So sorry.
Cheer up, lad.
She will be with the angels, my boy.
Our mortal forms are but shadows of a purer reality.
- Thank you for your comforting words.
- She was a great lady.
Sir, some time before your mother died she gave me a letter.
Her instructions were to hand it to Mr Allworthy as she was buried.
I will give it to my uncle.
She expressly said into no hands but Mr Allworthy's.
Lawyer Dowling, if my uncle lives he will need a new steward.
I intend to recommend you.
You are most kind, sir.
Do not grieve, my dear nephew.
Do not grieve.
Sir, you cannot die.
Death comes to us all, Tom.
I have asked you here to tell you of my will.
Nephew Blifil, I leave you heir to my whole estate, with these exceptions.
To you, my dear Tom,
I have given an estate of $800 a year, together with $1,000 in ready money.
I am convinced, my boy, that you have much goodness, generosity and honour in your nature.
If you will add prudence and religion to these, you must be happy.
$1,000 I leave to you, Mr Thwackum, and a like sum to you, Mr Square - which I am convinced exceeds your desires as well as your wants.
As for my servants, for Marjorie and Jane, $100 each.
"...my soul shall praise the Lord even to death, and my life was drawing near to hell beneath..."
Mr Allworthy's recovered!
It's over! The fever's gone!
He's sitting up! He's well again!
The squire's recovered!
It's over!
It is not true that drink changes a man's character.
It can reveal it more clearly.
The Squire's recovery brought joy to Tom, to his tutors sheer disappointment.
Sing, thick Thwackum, your bounty's flown...
You have good reason for your drunkenness, you beggarly bastard!
- He's provided well enough for you!
- Do you think that could weigh with me?
- Damn you, Thwackum!
- How dare you, sir?!
And damn me if I don't open another bottle.
I shall sing you a ballad, entitled "Sing, thick Thwackum, thy bounty has flown".
Sing, thick Thwackum, thy bounty's flown
You've lost all the money you thought that you'd own...
Mr Jones!
This house is in mourning on account of the death of my dear mother.
Oh, sir, forgive me.
The joy of Mr Allworthy's recovery...
I had the misfortune to know who my parents were.
Consequently, I'm grieved by their loss.
You rascal. Do you dare to insult me?
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
This behaviour is most unseemly.
Oh, Master Blifil!
Oh, that vulgar animal! Out with him!
All right, we'll go outside!
Let's have some wine!
Get him out! Get him out!
How dare you throw me out?
Shall we take the evening air?
It is widely held that too much wine will dull a man's desire.
Indeed it will - in a dull man.
Sophia...
Sophie...
I'll carve her name on this tree!
Tree, do you mind if I carve the name of my Sophia?
Big S for Sophia... Sophie...
Sophie, Sophia...
So... Molly...
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly...
M for Molly...
Are you aimin' to slit my throat, Squire?
Would you like... a sip of my wine?
Mm.
I never had a sip of a gentleman's wine before.
Oh, it's very potent!
What are you laughin' at, Tom?
I'm thinking of Square in your bedroom!
To those who find our hero's behaviour startling, the answer is simple:
Tom had always thought that any woman was better than none, while Molly never felt that one man was quite as good as two.
- He has a wench!
- A wench?
- Let's go and find the wicked girl.
- Yes!
Who's that?
- How dare you?!
- Thwacky! Ha-ha!
Mr Jones, control yourself!
How disgraceful!
Go away, sir! Go away, sir!
Take that, you wicked fool!
You there! Damnation to you!
Stop it! Stop! What's the matter with you?
Damnation to you! Get over there!
Whoa, there! Three falling onto one?
Whoa! The whip!
Come, lass, see to Tom.
He's in a devilish pickle, I promise you.
Tom... Shh. Poor Tom. Shh.
- Sophie, dear...
- Shh. I'll fetch some water.
- What are you brawling about, Tom?
- If you search the bushes you'll find out.
You lickerish dog, you!
Where is she? Where's Tom's pussy?
Puss, puss, puss, puss...
Where's Tom's pussy? Puss, puss, puss...
Sophie, I...
Come. After him.
- Sophie!
- Tom. Tom! Come and sup with me.
Gentlemen, let us make our peace over a bottle.
Sir, it is no slight matter for a man of my character to be buffeted by a boy just for trying to bring a wanton harlot to justice!
The fault lies with Mr Allworthy and yourself, sir.
If you would put the right laws into execution, you would soon rid the country of these... vermin.
Ha! I'd sooner rid the country of foxes!
Come, you sup with me. Damn me if there's nothing I wouldn't give you - except my hounds and my favourite mare, Miss Slouch.
Up...
Away, Miss Slouch!
Let us tell Mr Allworthy how the monster has behaved!
No, sirs, I beg of you, let us wait.
A better time will come.
Odds zodikins, it's me sister's coach.
What brings her from London?
I hope the old bitch has gone to bed.
Come, Sophie, sing us one of your jolly songs, my girl.
Father, I do not feel well.
I think I shall go to bed.
Not before you attend to your guest.
Tom here has a great thirst, I warrant you.
Western? What are these nocturnal riots?
- Now lookie here, Sister...
- Sophie?
- Yes, Aunt?
- To bed.
- Bed?
- Bed!
I'd be glad to, madam.
Now lookie here, Sister!
Brother, as I am here to stay a while,
I shall sign a peace treaty with you.
Sister, I've often warned you not to talk that court gibberish to me.
I pity your country ignorance from my heart.
And I despise your citified claptrap!
I'd rather be anything than a courtier, or a... or a Presbyterian, or a crawler around one of those damned German kings, as I believe some people are.
If you mean me, I'm a woman of...
Yes, and a good thing for you that you are.
If you were a man, I'd have lent you a flick long ago!
Brother, I think you are a perfect goat.
Good night, sir.
Good night, Sister.
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Oh, stop!
Brother!
Brother, have you not noticed something very extraordinary about Sophie lately?
Tell me, then. You know I love that girl more than my own soul.
Well, unless I am deceived, my niece is desperately in love.
In love?
In love?! Without my consent?!
I'll disinherit her!
I'll cast her out-of-doors stark naked without a farthing!
Where is she?
Supposing she should have fixed on the very person you would have wished?
No. No! She can love whom she pleases, but she'll marry the man I choose!
But she has fixed on the very person you would have wished!
- What?
- What think you of Mr Blifil?
- Young Blifil?
- Well, who else could there be?
In this rude country and society.
Who else is of her class?
'Fore George...
Nothing could lie handier together than Allworthy's estates and mine.
Come, Sister.
What do you advise me to do?
I think you should propose the match to Mr Allworthy... immediately.
I will propose it.
Saddle my horse!
Well, Nephew, how do you feel about this marriage between you and Miss Western?
- I will do exactly as you wish, Uncle.
- Oh, come, sir.
That is a cold answer when confronted by the prospect of so beautiful a young lady.
My dear Uncle,
I am well aware of the many pleasures of that noble institution, marriage, and I will gladly call upon the young lady at any time she will receive me.
Good. You shall call upon her this very afternoon.
Sophie, dear, what book is that you're reading?
A sad one.
- You blush, my dear Sophie.
- I have no thoughts to be ashamed of.
Now, Sophie, you know how I love you.
You know the easiness of my nature.
I have not always been like this.
I used to be thought cruel - by the men, I mean.
I was called "the cruel Parthenissa".
Now come.
I have news that will delight you.
What news, Aunt?
This very afternoon your father has arranged for you to receive your lover.
My lover?
He's coming?! This afternoon?!
Yes. And you're to put on all your best airs.
Why, Aunt!
You almost frighten me out of my senses!
You will come to yourself again.
He's a charming young fellow.
Dear, dear Aunt... I know none of such perfections.
So brave, and yet so gentle.
So handsome.
What matters his being baseborn?
Baseborn? What do you mean?
- Mr Blifil, baseborn?
- Mr Blifil?
Mr Blifil. Of whom else have we been talking?
- Why, Mr Jones!
- Mr Jones?!
Mr Blifil?! You can't be in earnest!
Oh, then I am the most unhappy woman alive.
How can you think of disgracing your family by allying yourself to a... bastard?
Madam, you have extorted this from me.
Whatever were my thoughts of that poor, unhappy Mr Jones,
I had intended to carry them to the grave.
I would rather follow you to that grave than see you disgrace us by such a match!
Yes! Yes!
No, no, no, no, no!
I will not marry that idiot!
To force me to do so would be to kill me!
Then die and be damned!
Damn me! What a misery it is to have daughters, when a man has a good mare and dogs.
Tom, that pig-headed hussy dares to refuse to marry Mr Blifil.
I'll turn her penniless out-of-doors if she doesn't!
Go to her, lad, and see what you can do.
Sophie! Sophie!
- Sophie!
- Sophie!
No! No! No, no! No!
- Sophie!
- Brother! Brother!
Sophie!
Sophie... Sophie...
Sophie, Sophie... Shh.
My dearest, promise you won't give yourself to Blifil.
- Don't say that name to me!
- Tell me, tell me I may hope!
Tom, you must go.
- Sophie, please...
- Or you'll be destroyed.
The only destruction I fear is the loss of my Sophie. I cannot part with you.
Can't I make you understand, you country clot?
Tom Jones?
Damnation!
Where is he? That parasite!
That home-wrecker! Where is he?
There they are!
Tom, you must go. Quick, Tom, quick.
Run, Tom, run!
Come back here!
- I'll get thee if I hang for it!
- Tom, run!
- Sophie, please!
- Run, Tom!
You there! Allworthy!
- A fine piece of work you've done!
- What can be the matter, Mr Western?
My daughter has fallen in love with your bastard!
That's what comes of trying to raise a bastard as a gentleman, and letting him go visiting to nice folks' houses.
- I'm sorry to hear you say this.
- A pox on your sorrow!
I've lost my only daughter.
My poor Sophie, the joy of my heart.
Little did I think, when I loved him as a sportsman, that he was all the while a-poaching my daughter!
I wish you had not given him so many opportunities with her.
What the devil did she have to do with him?
He came a-huntin' with me, not a-courtin' to her!
What are we to do, Mr Western?
Keep the rascal away from my house until I lock the wench up.
I'll make her marry Mr Blifil here if it's the last thing I do.
I'll have no other son-in-law but you.
So go to her, you jolly dog, you.
I tell you, you shall have her.
And as for that son-of-a-whore Jones, if I catch him anywhere near my gal,
I'll qualify him to run for the Gelding's Plate!
Come on, Miss Slouch, come on.
Even the best of horsemen should avoid the bottle.
However, the forces of sobriety were gathering in all their strength against our hero.
We draw your attention to the abominable behaviour of Mr Jones.
He is a monster of depravity and should be expelled from your house this instant.
You let her out of her room after I locked her in?
Women are convinced by reason, not by force.
The English of which is:
I am in the wrong!
As soon as she came back to live with you, Brother, she imbibed these romantic notions.
You don't imagine, do you, that I taught her such things?
Your ignorance, Brother, as the great
Milton says, almost subdues my patience.
Damn Milton!
If he had the impudence to be here and say it to my face, I'd lend him a flick.
Come on, my girl.
He was, according to the vulgar phrase, whistle drunk.
On the very day of your utmost danger, he filled the house with riot and debauchery.
And he even struck Master Blifil.
How?! Did he dare strike you?
Oh, Uncle, I'm sure
I've forgiven him for that long ago.
But the same evening we unluckily saw him... with a girl... in a manner not fit to be mentioned.
Mr Thwackum advanced to rebuke him when, I am sorry to say, he fell upon the worthy man and beat him outrageously.
Tell me, child, what objection can you have to the young gentleman?
A very solid objection, in my opinion -
I hate him.
Well, I have known many couples who have entirely disliked each other lead very comfortable, genteel lives.
Madam, I assure you,
I shall never marry a man I detest.
I still believe the young man to have a few redeeming graces.
Some of the crimes you accuse him of sprang from his mistaken compassion for the gamekeeper and his family.
Compassion, sir? Lust!
All his gifts, his so-called generosity, were merely bribes to debauch another innocent.
As you know, the unfortunate Molly...
Miss Sophie Western will be the next to be undone.
All this I would have revealed long ago, had not Master Blifil begged me to give him another chance.
Send him to me.
Tom, I have forgiven you too often in the past out of compassion for your youth and in hope of your improvement.
You must leave my house for ever.
However, I have educated you like my own child and would not turn you naked into this world.
Here is something which will enable you, with industry, to get a good employment.
Goodbye, Tom.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, sir.
Stay, boy. Stay.
Mr Allworthy is very sensible of the many advantages of binding our two estates together.
Indeed?
I had not realised Mr Allworthy was so interested in questions of property.
Oh, he is.
And you?
I? Well, naturally my attentions are set constantly on those most blissful and sanctified pleasures of holy matrimony.
Clandestine amours so soon, Mr Blifil?
I pray you, Aunt, excuse me.
I feel a little... faint.
The fox, Mr Blifil, the fox.
Tally-ho!
It is you who have taught her disobedience, Brother.
You are such a boor!
Boar? I am no boar! No! Nor ass!
Ah, more-than-gothic ignorance!
As for your manners, they deserve a cane!
And yours I despise as much as I do a fart!
And as for your niece, I'm going to lock her up in my tower this time!
You'll do nothing of the sort!
- Honor, promise to keep your word.
- I can't, madam. I'm frightened. I can't.
- I'm frightened, madam.
- Aaargh! Aaargh!
Got you, my girl! Come on!
Come on. You won't get out this time,
I warrant you!
Our hero was now on the road to London.
His first adventure was with a party of those men whose profligate ways could be conducted with safety only under the protection of red coats.
Good day, gentlemen.
Which way are you heading?
- North, to fight for the Protestant cause.
- Against Prince Charles?
Those damned Scots are already on their way to England.
I've been walking all day and I'm hungry.
May I buy some food and drink?
- Right, give him some.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Good day, Captain.
- Good day.
I perceive you are a gentleman.
We should be glad to welcome you into our company.
- I'd be glad to march with you.
- Good. We shall be on the march shortly.
There comes a time when men in a constant state of readiness for war will slip their leash and fight like dogs.
I believe... that a man can fight for no nobler cause than that of his religion.
Hear, hear.
I'd like to propose a toast to the Protestant cause.
Smoke the prig out, Northerton.
Smoke him.
Sir, were you ever at university?
Sir, so far from having been at university,
I was never at school.
Me neither!
I only presumed, sir, from the information of your great learning.
Sir, it is as easy for a man not to have been at school and know something as it is for a man to have been at school and know nothing.
Well said, young volunteer.
Upon my word, Northerton, you'd best let him alone or he'll prove too hard for you.
Give us a toast, young fellow.
Fill up his cup.
I would like to propose a toast... to the health, and bless the name... of Miss Sophie Western.
Sophie Western.
Sophie Western?
I knew one Sophie Western - was lain with by half the young fellows at Bath.
Perhaps this is the same woman.
Miss Western is a lady of fashion and fortune.
Oh aye, so she is, so she is!
Aye, it is the same young lady.
I'll lay half a dozen of Burgundy
Tom French of our regiment had her in the tavern at Bridge Street!
Sophie Western!
Sir! I can bear no jesting with this lady's character.
Jesting? Damn me if I was ever more in earnest in my life.
Tom French of our regiment had her and her aunt together at Bath.
You are the most impudent rascal on earth!
You've killed him, you swine!
Zounds, I was but in jest with the fellow.
I never heard of Miss Western in my life.
Then you deserve to be hanged. You are under arrest. Sergeant, take him away.
Arrest him.
But a hero cannot be lost until his tale is told.
For, heaven be thanked, we live in such an age where no man dies for love except upon the stage.
I'll kill you, Northerton...
I'm going to kill you, Northerton!
Northerton... Northerton...
Must find Northerton.
Must find Northerton...
Northerton!
Northerton!
Northerton!
Northerton!
Help! Help!
The ghost walks!
Shh! Shh!
Shh-shh-shh!
Come on, you, get up.
I can't afford for you to lie here idle any longer.
Get out and follow them rascally friends of yours!
You soldiers call yourselves gentlemen, but it's we who have to pay for you - and keep you too, for that matter!
- What are you talking about?
- That Lt Northerton escaped last night.
The rest of the company went in pursuit after him - and conveniently left without paying the bill.
- How could he have escaped?
- His doxy, a trollop called Mrs Waters.
The sentry disappeared and she let him out.
She'll soon learn what kind of a man he is.
Nothing's good enough for sparks like him, but paying the bill is another matter!
Don't worry, madam.
I will repay you handsomely.
Ah, sir... A nice young gentleman like yourself shouldn't want to get mixed up with them rough soldiers.
- It's gone.
- What's gone?
I had a $500 note in my breeches pocket and it's gone!
- That's a likely story.
- I had $500...
- You never had $500 in your life!
- One single note of $500, and it's gone!
- I should've known your kind...
- Who took it?!
Somebody's been in this room during the night and taken $500 out of my pocket!
Was it you? Did you see her take it?
Somebody took the $500 out of...
You lying rascal! Nor them cheating redcoat friends of yours, neither!
Go on, take your things and get out of here quick!
Go on! I'll set the dogs on you if you don't hurry up!
You blackguard! Robber!
The whole lot of you! You and your $500!
Wake up, you country stewpot!
Your daughter, sir!
While you've been lying a-bubbling here, your daughter is gone!
Rouse yourself from this pastoral torpor.
Your daughter is gone!
What?!
Come on, you lazy lot, and take the
London road! Come on, Miss Slouch!
- Are you wanting anything, madam?
- We're tired and in need of refreshment.
It'd be an honour to serve such a lady.
Has by any chance a young gentleman, a Mr Jones, passed this way?
Indeed he has. I'm surprised at a lady like you inquiring of the likes of him - brawling, thieving, bragging about his mistress - one Sophie Western.
- Sophie Western?
- I'm not surprised, after Molly Seagrim.
- But I am the same Sophie Western.
- Well, you can get out of here quick!
Go on! Follow your fine friend. Take your fine airs and graces with you!
This is a respectable house!
We don't want the likes of you here!
Our hero's next adventure concerns a lady in circumstances from which any gentleman would instinctively wish to free her - but of which any man who was not a gentleman might instantly want to take advantage.
Let her go, villain!
You savage!
Aaargh!
Sure, I've only myself to blame for trusting in a man so unworthy of my favours.
No, sir - you've had trouble enough.
My nakedness may well shame me. I'd go alone, but for the need of your protection.
Well then, in case any prying eyes should offend you,
I will walk ahead and escort you as far as Up... Upton.
So Tom and Mrs Waters - for so the lady was called - set out on the road to Upton,
Tom, like Orpheus leading
Eurydice out of Hell, hardly daring to look back in case the fires consumed him.
Sophie! Sophie Western!
Sophie!
- Cousin Sophie!
- Look, ma'am, 'tis Mrs Fitzpatrick!
- My cousin Harriet?
- The same.
Why, so it is.
- Cousin!
- Harriet!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to London.
That is my destination. But why are you both on one horse, indeed?
Oh, Harriet,
I am running away from home.
And I too - running away from my husband, Mr Fitzpatrick, who's hot on my trail, I'm sure.
Oh, never marry an Irishman - particularly if he is eaten up with jealousy, possessed of a quick temper, and a mighty fool into the bargain.
But what will you do alone in London?
I have a friend. He has taken lodgings for me in Curzon Street.
Cousin.
He's a dear, kind man, and a peer of the realm.
You can stay with me.
- May I?
- Come on.
- But your friend.
- He is away for a few days.
When he returns we will make other arrangements.
Now get in, Cousin.
Two rooms, please.
And perhaps you'd find this lady a gown.
She's been involved in an accident and deprived of her clothes.
Take us to our rooms at once.
Heroes - whatever high ideals we may have of them - are mortal, not divine.
We are all as God made us, and many of us much worse.
All right, all right, I'm coming.
I'm coming, I said!
- Where's me wife?
- Who?
Me wife! Mrs Fitzpatrick.
I have come a distance to fetch her.
- There's no Mrs Fitzpatrick here.
- I know she's here! I know it.
Where is that serpent-toothed siren?!
Who's here, girl? Tell me, and I'll make you the richest poor woman in the nation.
There's only a gentleman - Mr Jones.
- No lady?
- He has a Mrs Waters with him.
Waters! I'll bet she's usin' a false name!
That cunning wench! By the waters of the Babylon I shall lay me down...
I'll bet she's lying down beside Mr Jones!
Show me her room!
Now where is she?
Where is that painted Delilah?!
- Down the end there.
- Mrs Fitzpatrick!
- Come on, Mrs Fitzpatrick!
- My husband!
- Your husband?!
- Do you think I don't know his voice?
Discovered, you whore!
Aaargh! Rape! Murder! Rape!
- What is it, lassie?
- A rape's going on down there!
Rape?!
Rape! Murder! Murder!
What is all this?!
Mr MacLachlan, dear friend!
I rejoice to see you here.
- This villain has debauched my wife!
- Your wife? What wife?
Do I not know Mrs Fitzpatrick very well?
And can I not see that the lady in bed with this gentleman is not your wife at all?!
Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape!
Girl, what's this hullabaloo?
'Tis Tom Jones, madam, in bed with Mrs Waters and discovered by her husband - an Irish gentleman, madam.
Forgive me - did you say Tom Jones?
Yes, madam - in bed with that trull Mrs Waters.
Betrayed!
Ma'am, pray forgive my dastardly intrusion. I...
What the devil is this disturbance?
I thought myself in a respectable inn, but I see now it's a bawdyhouse!
I have made a mistake.
I was looking for me wife.
These villains burst into me room!
I heartily ask your pardon, ma'am.
I thought you was me wife.
Though I see no reason for a gentleman to be in a lady's bed in his shirt.
I heard her screams and ran in from the adjoining chamber.
Adjoining chamber!
It seems I have prevented the lady being robbed.
- Robbed!
- Robbed? I'll have your blood for that!
- You wild Irishman!
- Rape!
Come on, Sophie, dear. We must fly before Fitzpatrick discovers me.
Oh, come, pull yourself together, Coz.
We've got a long ride ahead of us.
Help!
Sophie...
Ah, got you, you fox!
Well, the vixen can't be far away!
Goodbye, madam.
I regret I must take my leave of you.
Odds bodikins! After him!
After him! Damnation! After him!
- Oh! There he is!
- Miss Western!
Brother!
Don't be dismayed, sir. She will soon be tired and will stop in some inn.
- She's bound for London, I'm sure.
- Ah, damn the girl.
I'm lamenting the loss of such a fine morning for huntin'.
It's confounded hard to lose one of the finest scentin' days of the season.
Whoa!
Ha!
- Come on, Miss Slouch!
- What are you doing?
Oh!
Dobson, drive on.
Get up, there! Get up!
Stand... and deliver!
Whoa!
- What did you say, sir?
- Stand and deliver!
Deliver? I am no travelling midwife, sir.
Deliver what?
Stand...
I will not stand for you, sir - no, nor for any man!
- Madam...
- Don't you point that firearm at me, sir!
- Dobson, drive on.
- Get up there!
It is hard when a woman leaves a man nothing but memories - and a muff.
Your money or your life!
- I only have one guinea, sir.
- Give it here.
As a gentleman of the road you cut a poor figure.
Be merciful, sir.
I didn't mean any harm. Truly I didn't.
- No harm?
- It isn't loaded.
- Nor it is.
- I'm not a bandit by profession, sir.
Just a poor man down on his luck.
Mine, sir, is a sad story.
The start of my ruin was 20 years ago.
- It was all over one Tom Jones.
- What do you mean?
At that time I was employed as a barber by a Mr Allworthy.
One day he found a baby abandoned in his bed.
I was accused of being the father.
- Then your name is...
- Partridge.
Father!
But I do assure you, sir, there was no truth in the accusation.
- Then who was my father?
- None of us ever discovered.
That was the whole beginning of my downfall.
Mr Partridge, how can I make up for the suffering you've had on my account?
Would you take me on as your servant, sir?
- My companion in misfortune!
- Oh, sir!
Are lodgings cheap in London?
I have no money.
I know an old lady who runs a lodging house in London.
She was Mr Allworthy's cook when I was his barber.
No friend of Mr Allworthy's will speak to me.
Mrs Miller is one of the kindest ladies I know.
Who knows? She may get you back in his favour.
Here, you're a lovely boy.
Are you going to stay?
Good day.
No. No, thank you.
Desperate to find his Sophie,
Tom called on Mrs Fitzpatrick, who was entertaining a certain Lady
Bellaston - the notorious Lady Bellaston.
It's the handsome young gentleman again, madam, inquiring for Miss Western.
You see, Bella, how persistent he is.
His servant discovered this address, and ever since he persecutes us.
Send him away, Abigail.
Tell him Miss Western is no longer here.
Bella, you must let Sophie come and stay with you.
My protector is coming back, and I fear he may take too much interest in my cousin.
Oh, Harriet, you can always rely on me.
Your little maid is obviously in the right.
He's a very pretty fellow. No wonder so many women are fond of him.
Harriet, we must do what we can for Sophie.
The girl is obviously intoxicated, and nothing less than ruin will content her.
I'm absolutely certain Sophie was at Mrs Fitzpatrick's when I called.
Dear Mrs Miller, what am I to do?
No friends, no money,
I know nothing of London...
You're not to worry about the money.
You can stay here for the moment.
You're very kind, Mrs Miller.
For you, Tom. It's just arrived.
I wonder, what can it be?
What is it?
It's an invitation to a masked ball.
"The Queen of the Fairies sends you this.
Treat her favours not amiss."
It's Mrs Fitzpatrick, perhaps, with news of my Sophie.
Or Miss Sophie herself.
Vauxhall Gardens, where people come to see and to be seen.
In heaps they run, some to undo and some to be undone.
It's no fun for a man like me to be dolled up in this damned fruppery!
All folks of fashion are here.
Sophie will be no exception.
Show her to me and I'll have her arrested!
Arrested! Do you imagine a woman of stature can be arrested in a civilised nation?
A pretty civilised nation indeed, where women are above the law!
Civilisation, my trunk!
Je vous meprise de tout mon cour.
Now, where can my niece be?
If you engage any longer with that trollop
I shall tell Miss Western.
- Is Sophie here, then, madam?
- Upon my honour, she is not here.
Mrs Fitzpatrick - if you are she - it's a little cruel to divert yourself at my expense.
And do you imagine, good sir,
I have no better regard for my cousin than to assist her in carrying on an affair between you two... which must end in her ruin?
Madam, that is the last thing I would wish.
If the Queen of the Fairies had so little regard for you and Sophie, she would not have appointed to meet you here.
Confess honestly:
Are you used, Mr Jones, to make these sudden conquests?
I am used, madam, to submit.
If you take my heart by surprise, the rest of my body has the right to follow.
I hope you won't follow me.
I protest I shall not know what to say if you do.
Free chair, sir. Free chair.
You must be a pauper if you can't go in a chair. Or a miser!
I thought you were Mrs Fitzpatrick.
Fitzpatrick...
Sir, I am unfamiliar with customs in the country, but in town it is considered impolite to keep a lady waiting.
With our usual good breeding, we will not follow this particular conversation further, but attend results on the following day.
Our hero released from Lady Bellaston a torrent of affection - as well as a flood of gifts, which he found suitably embarrassing and quite irresistible.
- We must have you looking your best.
- Lady Bellaston...
Isn't that what Miss Western would want?
Come back precisely at four.
I shall have news for you then.
- Send the bill to me, sir.
- Yes, milady. Very good, milady.
Good day, milady.
How could Tom know that Sophie was now staying here with Lady Bellaston?
And being besieged by a certain Lord Fellamar, a gentleman with an eye for any beauty - especially when a fortune was attached.
I do beg you to excuse the play.
But when may I see you again?
Forgive me, my lord.
I'm afraid my plans for remaining in London are still a little uncertain.
Good day, my lord.
Aaah... Aaah...
Oh, my la... Sophie!
Tom!
I see, Sophie, you're somewhat surprised.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to look for you.
I found your pocket book at Upton and came to ask if I might return it.
- How dare you mention that place to me?!
- Oh, Sophie, let me ask your pardon.
My pardon?! After what I heard at the inn?
You cannot despise me more than I do myself.
I thought, Miss Western, you were at the play.
The play caused so violent an uproar,
I got frightened and came home.
Where I found this gentleman.
He has apparently found the pocket book
I told your ladyship I had lost and wishes to return it.
And when I do so, all I ask is that I might have the honour of presenting it in person.
I presume, sir, you are a gentleman, and my doors are never shut to people of fashion.
Thank you, madam. Ladies.
Your cane, sir.
Oh.
A handsome fellow. I don't remember ever to have seen his face before.
Nor I neither, madam.
I suspected it was Mr Jones himself.
- Did your ladyship indeed?
- Yes.
I can't imagine what put the idea into my head, for, to give this fellow his due, he was very well dressed.
I think, dear Sophie, that is not often the case with your friend.
I thought your ladyship had said he was handsome.
- Whom, pray?
- Mr Jones.
I meant, of course, the gentleman who was with us just now.
Oh, Sophie, Sophie...
This Mr Jones, I fear, still runs in your head.
I assure you, madam,
Mr Jones means no more to me than the gentleman who has just left us.
Forgive me teasing you.
I promise...
I'll never mention his name again.
Take this to Lord Fellamar and beg him to attend me tomorrow.
She is the only daughter of a country booby squire.
At the playhouse she blazed like a star.
The first moment I saw her,
I loved her to distraction.
Her father's estate is a good $3,000 a year.
Then, madam, I think it the best match in all England.
Then, if you like her, my lord, you shall have her.
Honor!
A letter from my mistress.
- Upstairs?
- Honor!
- In here.
- I told my mistress she should...
Get behind that curtain and don't speak! Shh!
- My dear, charming Lady Bellaston.
- Dear? Charming?
You've been avoiding me.
I should scold you.
But I don't think I intend to.
- Shh! There is a lady...
- A lady? One of your ladies, I suppose.
- Where is she?
- Uh-uh-uh-uh...
There is a lady in the next room... a-dying, madam.
What scheme have you and Sophie been plotting behind my back?
- Madam, I don't understand.
- Answer me one question:
Have you not betrayed my honour to her?
Am I neglected, slighted for a country girl, for an idiot?
Neglected, madam?
"I charge you not to think of visiting again", Sophie desperately wrote to Tom.
"The truth will certainly be discovered."
"Something favourable perhaps may happen."
"Until then, we must be patient."
Courage, mon vieux.
Lord Fellamar is one of the most gallant young fellows about town.
Make love to you, indeed!
I only wish he would.
You would be mad to refuse him.
Then I shall most certainly be mad.
Entrez.
Madam. Miss Western is hardly encouraging.
My dear lord, you certainly need a cordial.
Fie upon it. Have more resolution.
Are you frightened by the word "rape"?
All women love a man of spirit.
Remember the story of the Sabine ladies.
I believe they made tolerably good wives afterwards.
Come this evening at nine.
I will see she is alone.
Oh, I am so entangled with this woman that I don't know how to extricate myself.
- I know. Propose marriage to her.
- To Lady Bellaston?!
Aye. Propose marriage to her and she'll call it off in a moment.
You've not a penny, and she'll think you're marrying her for her wealth.
It's very convincing for a man in your desperate situation.
But what if she took me at my word?
Then I'm caught in my own trap.
I promise you she won't.
She'll be the one to break it off.
- Lord Fellamar.
- Miss Western, it is I.
- I fear I break in upon you abruptly.
- Indeed, my lord, I am a little surprised.
Love... Love has deprived me of all reason.
My lord, I neither understand your words nor your behaviour.
You're the most adorable, most divine creature.
I do assure you, my lord,
I shall not wait to hear any more.
If I were master of the world,
I would lay it at your feet!
My lord, I beg you to stop.
Let go my hand.
I will never see you again.
Then, madam, we must make the best use of this moment.
What do you mean?
I have no fear but of losing you, madam!
Where is she?
Damn me if I won't unkennel her now!
Aaagh!
Oh, Father!
- Your father?
- Yes. And who in hell are you?
I, sir, am Lord Fellamar, the happy man whom I hope you will accept as your son-in-law.
You're a son of a whore, for all your fancy falderals!
- I resent your tone, sir.
- Resent, me arse!
I'll teach you to father-in-law me!
Ooh!
Father, put me down!
Put me down, Father!
"Dearest madam,"
Tom had carefully written,
"I am extremely concerned for fear your reputation should be exposed."
"There is only one way to secure it - that you bestow on me the legal right to call you mine for ever. Thomas Jones."
Understand this: I shall not receive
Mr Jones if he calls here again.
In London, love and scandal are considered the best sweeteners of tea.
I do not doubt that my niece will welcome the favours of a man like Lord Fellamar.
This Blifil is a hideous kind of fellow.
But, as you know, Bell, all country gentlemen are.
I don't then wonder at Sophie's infatuation for this Jones creature.
He's an agreeable fellow to look at.
Miss Western, will you believe me when I tell you that he has the audacity to make love to me?
Oh, these men!
I would've torn the eyes out of a prince if he had attempted such freedoms with me!
Indeed, he's even gone so far as to propose marriage to me.
With your leave, Bell,
I will show this to my niece.
Apply it to what purpose you may please.
- It's from my Sophie.
- Good.
"Sir, " she wrote, "my aunt has just now shown me a letter from you to Lady Bellaston which contains a proposal of marriage."
"All I desire is that your name may never more be mentioned to your obliged humble servant,
Sophie Western."
You could try Mrs Fitzpatrick.
She might be able to help.
'Tis said that hope is a bad supper, but makes a good breakfast, and in the morning Tom set off for Mrs Fitzpatrick to seek help.
Not a moment too soon, for who should arrive but his old benefactor, Squire Allworthy.
Mr Allworthy!
What an unexpected pleasure.
- Good morning, Mrs Miller.
- You are come to forgive him.
- Forgive who, Mrs Miller?
- Dear Mr Jones.
Mr Jones, here, madam?
No, I've come to bring my nephew Mr Blifil to London.
She must be a most contemptible woman who can overlook merits such as yours.
An old acquaintance arrives.
I swear that dirty whore's had it now!
You wait till I get me hands on her!
Let us meet tomorrow. We will find a way of easing your predicament.
Oh...
Yes, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Oh!
I'm very sorry...
My dear sir, I hope no ill blood remains between us.
Sir, I don't remember your name.
Nor I yours, but I remember your face from the inn at Upton.
- Upton... Then your name is Tom Jones?
- Indeed it is, sir.
Then you have been with me wife after all!
Well, that's for you, you rascal!
And if you don't give me satisfaction for that blow, I'll give you another!
Fight, damn you!
Aargh!
- I'm sorry, but you drew this on yourself.
- Liar! You set on him to rob him!
I was coming out of the house...
Only to defend myself! He drew his sword!
Step back there. What's this all about?
Yes - for armed robbery.
- You're certain the bastard will hang?
- No doubt of it.
I hired these two to follow Master Jones - which they did with rare zeal.
Good. See that they're properly taken care of, will you?
I will break the news to my uncle.
Mr Jones has one of the kindest hearts I know.
He never mentions your name but to praise it.
Uncle...
I am afraid to tell you what has happened.
It may shock you too much.
What's the matter, Nephew?
Your adopted son, sir - Jones - has proved himself one of the greatest villains on earth.
If anyone else called him a villain
I'd throw this tea in his face.
Mrs Miller.
I know he's not without faults, but they're those of wildness and youth, and I am sure many of us have worse.
At least we're not footpads, Mrs Miller.
What do you mean?
Mr Jones has attacked a man.
He has been sentenced to be hanged at Tyburn.
Nobody can save him now.
If he swing by the string
He will hear the bell ring
And then there's an end to poor Tommy
He must hang by the noose,
For no hand will cut loose
The rope from the neck of poor Tommy
If he swing...
If he swing...
And Tom was to swing - his enemies had determined on that.
So Lawyer Dowling decided to pay a call on Mr Fitzpatrick, and who should receive him but Mrs Waters.
Strictly confidential.
I come from a most worthy gentleman, whose name at the moment
I am not at liberty to divulge.
What does this mysterious gentleman want of me?
He wants you to help him see that justice is done.
To make sure that Jones gets his just deserts.
For any assistance you can give him he is prepared to pay handsomely.
He is? You interest me, sir.
What is the proposition?
Meanwhile, faithful Partridge searched for anyone who could prove Tom's innocence of the charge against him.
Constable...
Constable, have you seen a man with a big scar on his cheek?
No, can't say as I 'ave.
But all the rogues in the district haunt that tavern yonder.
Will you accompany me?
I don't go searching for trouble, friend.
It's easy enough to come by.
Excuse me... Are you the two gentlemen that saw the fight with Mr Jones?
Tom cannot escape the gallows unless you retract your evidence.
I beg you to do so. And in the meantime,
I assure you, you will be rewarded.
Hark ye, sir, everything we said was true!
Now if I were you, I'd be off, or you're gonna be the worse for it!
Only one hope was left now, poor Partridge thought - Fitzpatrick.
Now that's better.
You'll be all right in a minute.
Come in.
Sorry for the intrusion, Mrs Fitzpatrick.
Well, if it isn't Mr Partridge!
Jenny Jones!
- But I'm Mrs Waters now.
- Whatever are you doing here?
I'm a close friend of Mr Fitzpatrick.
I'm looking after him.
Well, indeed, I came to see Mr Fitzpatrick to plead for your son.
- My son?!
- Your son, Tom Jones.
He never intended to wound Mr Fitzpatrick.
But I met the man who wounded
Mr Fitzpatrick, at Upton.
Then that is the same man - your son, Tom Jones.
With his own mother?!
- With Jenny Jones?!
- How could either have known, sir?
Good heavens, in what miserable distresses do vice and imprudence involve men!
Ma'am, there's a Mrs Waters here to see Mr Allworthy.
- What is she doing here?!
- The very woman herself, sir.
- You probably don't recognise me, sir.
- Indeed you are much changed.
But what business can you have with me now?
Such business as I can impart only to you, sir.
Pray leave us.
This, sir, is the very man
I was telling you about!
- But he is my steward.
- Nevertheless, this is the man.
- Do you know this lady?
- That lady, sir?
Mr Dowling, if you value my favour, you will not hesitate, but answer truly.
- Do you know this lady?
- I have seen her, sir.
Before my sister died, did she give you a letter for me, sir?
Come with me, sir.
Partridge, have my coach brought round at once!
Yes, sir.
- Uncle...
- Before I return, you'd best find the letter which your mother gave to Dowling here before she died!
Ah, good day, neighbour.
Are you going to see your bastard hang?
On the contrary, Mr Western, we're going to Newgate jail to save him.
Save him? Save him for what?
And this what Mr Allworthy is saying to Mr Western:
My friend Mr Fitzpatrick has now recovered and is no longer charging Tom with robbery.
I'm as pleased as if he were me own son - which, it may surprise you to know, he's not.
Mr Allworthy's own sister Bridget was Tom's mother, and I the one who put the baby in the squire's bed.
And that is what it says in the letter.
And so Tom is now my only heir!
Your heir? Did you say your heir?
Yes, neighbour. To Newgate, Goody, and drive for dear life!
But I always loved that boy best!
He shall have my Sophie by the hand!
Tyburn, here I come!
Come on, Miss Slouch! Come on!
And another old acquaintance has arrived, not only reinstated in the army, but now in charge of the condemned.
On your life, Goody, faster!
Turnkey!
I have come to release a Mr Tom Jones.
We sent him off hours ago.
He'll be strung up by now.
- But they can't hang him!
- I have procured this pardon for him!
- They can't hang an innocent man!
- They have done often enough before.
They won't have reached Tyburn yet.
We must stop them. Come.
If he swing by the string
He will hear the bell ring
And then there's an end to poor Tommy
Faster, faster, Goody!
Better luck in the next world, Mr Jones.
To die for a cause is a common evil.
To die for nonsense is the devil.
And 'twould be the devil's own nonsense to leave Tom Jones without a rescuer.
Aargh!
Oh, my dear boy! Forgive me!
Forgive you?
How can I ever make amends for those unjust suspicions I've held of you?
- You have always used me kindly.
- No, Nephew. I have used you cruelly.
- Nephew?
- Yes.
You are indeed illegitimate, but your mother was not this lady here, but my sister Bridget.
- Uncle!
- It is true, Tom.
Ah, this is no time for explanations!
Tom, thou art as hearty a cock as any in the kingdom.
Go on, after your mistress.
Alas, I fear I've sinned against her for all time. I doubt if she'll speak to me.
No, Tom, don't say you've lost her yet.
Go to her now.
- Go on, Tom,
- Go to her.
Go on, lad.
I will!
Ah, go to her, lad! To her!
Hark ye, Allworthy, I'll bet thee a thousand pounds to a crown we'll have a boy tomorrow nine months.
Happy the man and happy he alone, he who can call today his own, he who, secure within, can say "Tomorrow, do thy worst, for I have lived today."
In the last century, before the birth of the new faith called Christianity, which was destined to overthrow the pagan tyranny of Rome and bring about a new society, the Roman Republic stood at the very center of the civilized world.
"Of all things fairest," sang the poet,
"first among cities and home of the gods is golden Rome. "
Yet, even at the zenith of her pride and power the Republic lay fatally stricken with a disease called human slavery.
The age of the dictator was at hand waiting in the shadows for the event to bring it forth.
In that same century, in the conquered
Greek province of Thrace, an illiterate slave woman added to her master's wealth by giving birth to a son whom she named Spartacus.
A proud, rebellious son who was sold to living death in the mines of Libya before his thirteenth birthday.
There, under whip and chain and sun, he lived out his youth and his young manhood, dreaming the death of slavery
2,··· years before it finally would die.
Back to work!
Back to work!
Get up, Spartacus, you Thracian dog!
Come on, get up!
Get up! Get...
Oh, my ankle!
My ankle!
My ankle!
Guard! Guard!
Spartacus again, huh?
Well, this time he dies.
Move along!
Back to work, all of you!
Welcome,
Lentulus Batiatus.
Welcome, indeed, my dear Captain.
Oh, 11 miles through this disastrous heat and the cost of hiring an escort, ruinous.
Even so, I warrant you have nothing fit to sell me, have you, Captain?
I've wasted both my time and my money.
Tell me the truth.
We have a few you might be interested in.
These? Carrion.
The buzzards are late.
This one's not bad.
He's a Gaul.
I don't like Gauls.
Hairy.
Can he come down unassisted?
Come down, you.
Come down!
Be good enough to show me the teeth.
Open your mouth.
Thank you.
Yes, as the teeth go, so go the bones.
This mouth is really impermissible.
The fellow's made of chalk.
We have many others.
The sun's over there.
I have to pay these people.
Who's that?
This one's a
Thracian.
I'm making an example of him.
How?
Starve him to death.
It's the only thing that impresses slaves.
What a pity.
He reacts.
Good muscle tone.
Can I see his teeth?
Open your mouth,
Spartacus.
You smell like a rhinoceros.
Captain, the teeth. You asked him to open his mouth.
He doesn't obey you?
His teeth are the best thing about him.
He hamstrung a guard with them not more than an hour ago.
Marvelous. I wish I'd been here. I'll take him.
Let's look at some of the others.
Come along.
In spite of sickness and death, we will profit
11,000 sesterces.
Including your commission, of course.
Oh, no, sir.
Without my commission.
Marcellus, there they are.
They're a dirty-looking lot, but it's the best I could find.
No one else could have made so fine a choice.
Slaves, you have arrived at the gladiatorial school of Lentulus Batiatus.
You'll be trained by experts to fight in pairs to the death.
You won't fight to the death here.
That will be after you've been sold and then for ladies and gentlemen of quality, for those who appreciate a fine kill.
A gladiator's like a stallion, he must be pampered.
You'll be oiled, bathed, shaved, massaged, taught to use your heads.
A good body with a dull brain is as cheap as life itself.
You'll be given your ceremonial caudas.
Marcellus, please.
There.
Be proud of them.
On special occasions, those who please me will even be given the companionship of a young lady.
Approximately half our graduates live for five, 10,
10 years.
Some even attain freedom and become trainers themselves.
Marcellus.
I congratulate you.
And may fortune smile on most of you.
Marcellus, watch the second from the right.
He's a Thracian. They were going to kill him for hamstringing a guard.
We'll break him of that.
Don't overdo it.
He has quality.
Next.
Next.
I like you.
I want you to be my friend.
I want to be your friend.
All I ask is that you get along with me.
What's your name, slave?
Spartacus.
I feel you don't like me.
Give him your sword.
Take it!
I have a feeling you want to kill me.
This is the only chance you'll ever get.
Kill me.
Don't be afraid, slave.
You have that sword.
I only have this piece of wood.
Are you going to disobey me?
Take his sword.
You're not as stupid as I thought.
You might even be intelligent.
That's dangerous for slaves.
You just remember, from now on everything you do I'll be watching.
You did the right thing.
Every once in a while Marcellus likes to kill a man as an example.
I think he's picked you.
Better watch him.
How long have you been here?
Six months.
I wish he'd pick me.
I want one chance at that pig before they carry me out!
Quiet!
No talking down there.
Dionysius, you'll get us in trouble just like in the mines.
What's your name?
You don't want to know my name.
I don't want to know your name.
Just a friendly question.
Gladiators don't make friends.
If we're ever matched in the arena together,
I'll have to kill you.
Helena with Galino.
Patricia,
Crixus.
Priscilla,
David.
Claudia,
Pharox.
Varinia,
Dionysius.
No, no.
Spartacus.
Spartacus.
Felicia...
I've never had a woman.
You have one now, Spartacus.
You must take her.
Go away.
What will she think of you?
Indeed, what will I think of you?
Go away.
Come, come.
Be generous.
We must learn to share our pleasures.
I'm not an animal!
You're not trying to escape, by any chance?
Direct your courage to the girl, Spartacus.
I'm not an animal!
I'm not an animal.
Neither am I.
What's your name?
Varinia.
You'll have to take her out of here, Marcellus.
You may not be an animal,
Spartacus, but this sorry show gives me little hope that you'll ever be a man.
First rule, you get an instant kill on the red.
Here, here.
Always remember, go for the red first.
If you don't, your opponent will.
In the blue, you get a cripple.
Here, here, here and here.
Second rule, go for the cripple before the slow kill.
Here's a slow kill on the yellow.
Here, here and here.
Remember, a slow kill may have enough left in him to kill you before he dies.
With a cripple, you know you've got him if you keep your distance and wear him down.
The rest is all right for a public spectacle in Rome, but here at Capua we expect more than simple butchery and we get it.
Spartacus, why are you looking at that girl?
Varinia! Stand still.
Since all you can do is look at girls, all right, slave, go ahead and look.
I said, look.
No. No, this one goes to the Spaniard.
Have a good night's rest,
Spartacus.
In there.
Woman!
I've warned you about this kind of thing.
All right, bring them in.
No talking!
Move along.
Did they hurt you?
No.
That's a kill.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four...
We have visitors, tremendous visitors.
Two simply enormous
Roman lords on the hill.
How easily impressed you are, Ramon.
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I suppose they're enormous.
Tell them to wait for me when they arrive.
Master, you don't understand...
How enormous do these Roman lords get?
One of them is Marcus Licinius Crassus.
What?
Wait a minute.
Crassus here? My red toga with the acorns.
Chairs in the atrium.
Second-best wine.
No, the best, but small goblets.
Gracchus. You know how Crassus loathes him.
Take him away.
I can't lift it.
Use your imagination.
Cover him.
Tell Marcellus to get the men ready.
Crassus has expensive taste.
He'll want a show.
Forgive me, Gracchus.
Marcus
Licinius Crassus.
Most noble radiance, first general of the Republic, father and defender of Rome, honor my house.
Bless it with your presence.
Wine, sweetmeats!
Can't you see that
Their Honors are exhausted?
Have the goodness to sit.
Is anything wrong,
Your Nobility?
No.
Welcome to the
Lady Claudia Maria, former wife of
Lucius Caius Marius whose recent execution touched us all deeply.
Honor to the Lady Helena, daughter of the late
Septimus Optimus Glabrus, whose fame shall live on forever in the person of his son, your brother,
Marcus
Publius Glabrus, hero of the Eastern War.
How very much he knows.
Allow me to bring you up-to-date.
We're here to celebrate the marriage of my brother to the Lady Claudia.
A mating of eagles,
Your Sanctity.
Fan His Magnitude.
He sweats.
No, no.
No, no.
My young friends desire a private showing of two pairs.
Two pairs?
Oh, yes. I have something that would please them.
Two pairs to the death.
To the death,
Your Ladyship?
Surely you don't think we came all the way to Capua for gymnastics?
But I beg,
Your Honors, we train the finest gladiators in all Italy.
We can give you a display of swordsmanship which is better than you can see in Rome.
When they're sold, their new masters may do with them as they wish.
But here, no, we never fight them to the death.
Crassus.
Today is an exception.
But the ill feeling, it would spread through the whole school.
Then the cost.
Oh, the cost.
Name your price.
25,000 sesterces.
Arrange it.
Are you serious, sir?
Arrange it immediately.
Of course, we shall want to choose them ourselves.
You do have a certain variety?
Inexhaustible.
Spartacus, there's going to be a fight to the death.
To the death?
How do you know?
I heard Marcellus tell one of his guards.
Who fights?
I don't know.
To the death.
What if they matched you and me?
They won't.
What if they did?
Would you fight?
I'd have to.
So would you.
Would you try to kill me?
Yes, I'd kill.
I'd try to stay...
I'd try to stay alive, and so would you.
All gladiators up to the training area.
Some visitors want to admire you.
Form a line in front of me.
Would Your Excellencies care to make your selection now?
Claudia.
Oh, they're magnificent.
For you,
Lady Helena, may I suggest
Praxus?
A veritable tiger.
I don't like him.
I prefer that one.
Which one?
No, no.
David?
Oh, Crixus, yes.
Ah, Marcellus,
Crixus for the short sword.
Have you ever seen such a pair of shoulders? Dionysius.
I admit he's small, but he's very compact and extremely strong.
In fact, he looks...
He looks smaller here than he does in the arena.
Optical.
Give me that one.
Oh, Galino.
Yes, yes. Galino.
You have a shrewd eye,
Your Pulchritude, if I may permit myself the...
Galino.
Practically every man in this school is an expert with a Thracian sword but the trident is something very rare these days.
May I suggest the Ethiopian?
There are very few
Ethiopians in the country.
Ethiopians are recognized as masters of the trident.
I'll take him.
Draba? Oh, no.
For you I want the best.
I do think the Ethiopian...
I want the most beautiful.
I'll take the big black one.
Draba.
Only one man in the entire school stands a chance with the Thracian knife against the trident.
There.
Over there,
Lady Helena.
He's impertinent.
I'll take him.
And he's a coward to boot.
Have him flogged.
Over there, Lady Helena.
The beast of Libya.
I prefer the coward.
Spartacus.
If both men are down and refuse to fight your trainer will slit their throats.
We want no tricks.
Tricks, madam?
At the school of Batiatus?
You heard the instruction,
Marcellus? Remember it.
I feel sorry for the poor things in this heat.
Don't put them in those suffocating tunics.
Let them wear just enough for modesty.
Whatever they wear, Lady, they'll bless your name.
Back, the rest of you.
Our choosing has bored you?
No, most exciting.
I tingle.
Do let's get out of the sun.
May I conduct Your
Magnificences to the gallery?
An eavesdropper.
Oh, the gods.
How far from Rome must I go to avoid that cunning face?
Don't talk about
Gracchus. He's so hateful.
For Gracchus, hatred of the patrician class is a profession and not such a bad one, either.
How else can one become master of the mob and first senator of Rome?
Crassus, it's so boring.
I believe that girl smells of perfume.
Whatever it is, she smells most delectable.
You can't keep slaves from stealing unless you chain them.
When a slave's as pretty as she is, she doesn't have to steal.
An arrangement is made.
If her ankles are good, you can be sure an arrangement was made.
Oh, master!
A catastrophe.
I've been anointed.
Why, you trollop!
You did that on purpose.
It was an accident.
Come here, girl.
Don't be frightened.
What country are you from?
Britannia.
How long have you been a slave?
Since I was 13.
You have a certain education.
My first master had me tutored for his children.
I like her.
She has spirit.
I'll buy her.
Buy her,
Your Magnificence?
I have spent quite a lot of money on her.
I've no doubt of it.
2,000 sesterces.
She'll be waiting at your litter.
No, I don't want her feet spoiled by walking.
Send her to Rome with your steward the next time he has to go there.
He leaves tomorrow, and the girl with him.
More wine, and thank your gods.
You provoke me, Crassus. I shan't be nice to you anymore.
Why distress me so much?
You're horribly rich, yet you're the only one of my brother's friends who hasn't given him a wedding present.
I was saving it for a more suitable moment.
Here.
Give it to him, child.
What is it?
As from this moment, your husband is commander of the garrison of Rome.
Wonderful.
I don't know how I shall ever be able to repay you.
Time will solve that mystery.
The garrison of Rome.
Yes.
The only power in Rome strong enough to checkmate Gracchus and his Senate.
You are clever.
Open up.
Through that door.
You will have to watch him, Claudia.
Father almost disinherited him because of slave girls.
The marriage contract absolutely forbids a harem.
What about your litter bearers?
Every one of them is under 20 and taller than they should be.
She sets rather a high standard for you.
Your pleasure, Your Highness.
To you, my dear, shall go the honor of starting this poetic drama.
Open up.
First pair!
Crixus and Galino!
Those who are about to die salute you.
Crixus.
Next pair!
Those who are about to die salute you.
Your Thracian's doing well.
How were you able to get my appointment without Gracchus knowing?
I fought fire with oil.
I purchased the Senate behind his back.
I still think the trident's going to win.
Why doesn't he kill him?
Kill him.
What's the matter now?
Kill him!
Kill him!
Kill him, you imbecile!
Kill him!
Kill him!
He'll hang there till he rots.
Take a last look,
Spartacus.
She's going to Rome.
She's been sold.
She's been sold?
No talking in the kitchen, slave.
There's trouble in the mess hall.
They killed Marcellus and maybe the other two.
Call out the guard.
Move, move.
On second thoughts, I'll deliver the girl personally.
Ride to Capua. Call out the garrison. I don't trust this lot.
I hold you responsible.
Yes, sir.
Around Capua, they ravaged the countryside, forcing other slaves to join them.
Looting, robbing, burning everything, while they make their camp in the escarpments of Vesuvius.
Each day swells their numbers.
The situation lies in the hands of this august body.
Where's the mighty Crassus?
Out of the city.
At least, you're here.
No need to fear for Rome as long as Glabrus is with us.
Let me add, over 100 estates have been burned.
Among them, gentlemen, my own.
Burned to the ground and 3 million sesterces lost.
I propose the immediate recall of
Pompey and his legions from Spain.
I could raise 500 men and bring the lot of them in.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
Why call back the legions when the garrison of Rome has nothing to do but to defend us from sausage makers?
Let's send Glabrus against these scoundrels.
Give them a taste of Roman steel.
I protest.
I most strongly protest.
There are more slaves in Rome than Romans.
With the garrison absent, what's to prevent them from rising, too?
I did not say the whole garrison.
Six cohorts will more than do the job.
The rest can stay in Rome to save you from your housemaids.
Will you accept such a charge, Glabrus?
I accept the charge of the Senate, if the Senate truly charges me.
The garrison of Rome stands ready.
Slave hunting's a dirty business.
It takes a brave commander to consent to it.
I propose we turn the city out tomorrow in tribute to Glabrus as he marches through.
And for temporary command of the garrison during his absence,
I propose
Caius Julius Caesar.
You don't look very happy over the new job.
It's not a serious disturbance.
Glabrus will be back.
Maybe.
At least it gives me a chance to separate Glabrus from Crassus for a while.
You know, this Republic of ours is something like a rich widow.
Most Romans love her as their mother.
But Crassus dreams of marrying the old girl, to put it politely.
Hail Glabrus.
Hail Glabrus.
Hail Glabrus!
God be with you,
Glabrus.
And with you, too.
I hope he returns to such applause.
Oh, one fat one,
Fimbria.
Keep the change.
Give it to your wife.
May the gods adore you.
Only through your prayers.
Let's make an old-fashioned sacrifice for Glabrus' success, hmm?
I thought you had reservations about the gods.
Privately, I believe in none. Neither do you.
Publicly,
I believe in them all.
Greetings,
Marcus Clodius Flavius!
Is Marcus Glabrus in attendance?
He awaits you in the atrium, sir.
Excellent.
What have we here?
A gift from the Governor of Sicily.
"Antoninus.
Sicilian, age 26,
"singer of songs. "
For whom did you practice this wondrous talent?
For the children of my master whom I also taught the classics.
Classics, indeed.
What position have we, I wonder, for a boy of such varied gifts?
You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.
All of you, come with me.
Are you on guard duty?
My dear Crassus, congratulate me.
Or better still, let us congratulate each other.
I congratulate us.
Tomorrow I lead six cohorts of the garrison against the slaves on Vesuvius.
The whole city is turning out to see us off.
Great merciful bloodstained gods!
Your pardon.
I always address heaven in moments of triumph.
Did Gracchus have something to do with this brilliant affair?
Yes, he proposed it.
Rather decently, too.
And you?
Do you think I made you commander to control some rock patch on Vesuvius?
It was to control the streets of Rome!
I only take six cohorts. The rest of the garrison remain.
Under whose command?
Under Caesar's.
Oh, excellent, excellent.
Finding Gracchus in control of the mob and the Senate, you felt impelled to hand over the garrison to him also.
I see.
I'll refuse, withdraw from the expedition.
One of the disadvantages of being a patrician is that occasionally you're obliged to act like one.
You've pledged to go, and go you must.
If Gracchus should decide to move against you...
He won't!
Has no need to.
He has, with your assistance, immobilized me altogether.
Your legions are in camp outside the city walls?
My legions?
Do you truly believe I'd order my legions to enter Rome?
You can, if you have to.
Are you not aware of Rome's most ancient law, that no general may enter the city at the head of his armed legions?
Sulla did.
Sulla?
To the infamy of his name!
To the utter damnation of his line!
No, my young friend.
One day I shall cleanse this Rome which my fathers bequeathed me.
I shall restore all the traditions that made her great.
It follows that I cannot come to power or defend myself by an act which betrays the most sacred tradition of all.
I shall not bring my legions within these walls.
I shall not violate Rome at the moment of possessing her.
Go.
Prepare your troops at once.
March out of Rome tonight, but the tribute is impossible.
We've already been made to look a fool.
Let's not add the trappings of a clown.
Leave by unfrequented streets without fanfare, without even a drum.
Sneak out.
As you wish.
And for heaven's sake, my young friend, see to it that you don't have to sneak back again.
Farewell.
Come on, fat boy!
Spartacus, come on!
Come on!
Noble Romans.
Fighting each other like animals.
Your new masters, betting to see who'll die first.
Drop your swords.
No! No!
No! No!
I want to see their blood here where Draba died!
When I fight matched pairs, they fight to the death.
I made myself a promise,
Crixus.
I swore that if I ever got out of this place,
I'd die before I'd watch two men fight to the death again.
Draba made that promise, too.
He kept it.
So will I.
Go on. Get out!
What are we,
Crixus?
What are we becoming?
Romans?
Have we learned nothing?
What's happening to us?
We look for wine when we should be hunting bread.
When you've got wine, you don't need bread!
We can't just be a gang of drunken raiders.
What else can we be?
Gladiators.
An army of gladiators.
There's never been an army like that.
One gladiator's worth any two Roman soldiers.
We beat the Roman guards here, but a Roman army's different.
They fight different.
We can beat anything they send against us if we want to.
It takes a big army.
We'll have a big army.
Once we're on the march, we'll free every slave in every town and village.
Can anybody get a bigger army?
Once we cross the Alps, we're safe.
Nobody can cross the Alps. Every pass is defended by its own legion.
There's only one way to get out of this country.
The sea.
What good is the sea if you have no ships?
The Cilician pirates have ships.
They're at war with Rome.
Every Roman galley that sails out of Brundusium pays tribute.
They've got the biggest fleet in the world. I was a galley slave with them.
Give them enough gold, they'll take you anywhere.
We haven't got enough gold.
Take every Roman we capture and warm his back a little.
We'll have gold all right.
Spartacus is right!
Let's hire these pirates and march straight to Brundusium!
Come join us.
All of you, come join us.
Come on and join us!
Come on!
Hey!
Back to Vesuvius!
Varinia.
I thought
I'd never see you again.
Everything's so different.
The last time I saw you, you...
You were waiting in the arena to...
I... I thought you were in Rome.
How'd you escape?
I...
I jumped out of the cart and Batiatus was so fat...
I flew out of the cart and Batiatus was so fat that he couldn't catch me.
He couldn't catch up with me.
Do you realize nobody can ever sell you again?
Nobody can sell you.
Or give you away.
Nobody can ever make you stay with anyone.
Nobody can make you stay with anybody.
Oh, I love you,
Spartacus.
I love you.
I love you. I love you.
I still can't believe it.
Forbid me ever to leave you.
I do forbid you.
I forbid you.
I forbid you.
I forbid you.
It was funny at the time.
How good you are to me, if I may say so.
You may.
Thank you.
Don't just eye those birds. Eat them.
There's no need to be on your best behavior here.
May I remind you you've been good to me in the past.
I've been good to you?
Oh, ho, ho.
Oh, yes.
You've sold me slaves at an extremely reasonable price.
And you arranged gladiatorial jousts at cost, practically.
You are both ethical in business and certainly farsighted socially.
Zenobia's put on weight since I last saw her.
Hasn't she?
I like it.
So do I.
You and I have a tendency towards corpulence.
Corpulence makes a man reasonable, pleasant and phlegmatic.
Have you noticed the nastiest of tyrants are invariably thin?
In spite of your vices, you are the most generous Roman of our time.
Vices?
Ladies.
Ladies?
Since when are they a vice?
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.
I hope I pronounced that word...
It's well-known that even your groom and butler are women.
I'm the most virtuous man in Rome.
I keep these women out of my respect for Roman morality.
That morality which has made Rome strong enough to steal two-thirds of the world from its rightful owners, founded on the sanctity of Roman marriage and family.
I happen to like women.
I have a promiscuous nature and unlike these aristocrats,
I will not take a marriage vow which my nature will prevent me from keeping.
You have too great a respect for the purity of womankind.
Exactly.
It must be tantalizing to be surrounded by so much purity.
It is.
Let's mix business with pleasure. How may I help you?
Great Gracchus,
I find it difficult to hate, but there's one man I can't think of without fuming.
Who's that?
Crassus.
You've grown very ambitious in your hatred.
Do you blame me? There I was, better than a millionaire in the morning and a penniless refugee by nightfall with nothing but rags and my flesh.
All because Crassus decides to break his journey at Capua with a couple of capricious, over-painted nymphs.
These two daughters of Venus had to taunt the gladiators, force them to fight to the death, and before I knew what had happened, revolution on my hands.
What revenge have you in mind?
I sold Crassus this woman Varinia.
Whom?
Varinia. May the gods give her wings.
There was no contract, but she was clearly his slave as soon as the deal was made.
Now she's off with Spartacus killing people in their beds.
And Crassus, no mention of money.
You never offered me this woman. Why not?
Well, she's not remotely your type, Gracchus.
She is very thin and...
Look around you.
You'll see women of all sizes.
Well, yes.
500 sesterces deposit on Varinia.
Since he hasn't paid, this gives me first call over Crassus when she's caught.
May the gods adore you.
Why do you buy a woman you've never seen?
To annoy Crassus, of course, and help you.
Fetch a stool,
Antoninus.
In here with it.
That will do.
Do you steal,
Antoninus?
No, master.
Do you lie?
Not if
I can avoid it.
Have you ever dishonored the gods?
No, master.
Do you refrain from these vices out of respect for the moral virtues?
Yes, master.
Do you eat oysters?
When I have them, master.
Do you eat snails?
No, master.
Do you consider the eating of oysters to be moral and the eating of snails to be immoral?
No, master.
Of course not.
It is all a matter of taste, isn't it?
Yes, master.
And taste is not the same as appetite and therefore not a question of morals, is it?
Hmm?
It could be argued so, master.
That will do.
My robe, Antoninus.
My taste includes both snails and oysters.
Antoninus, look.
Across the river.
There is something you must see.
There, boy, is Rome.
The might, the majesty, the terror of Rome.
There is the power that bestrides the known world like a colossus.
No man can withstand Rome.
No nation can withstand her.
How much less a boy?
Hmm?
There's only one way to deal with Rome, Antoninus.
You must serve her.
You must abase yourself before her.
You must grovel at her feet.
You must love her.
Isn't that so, Antoninus?
Antoninus!
Antoninus?
Take your time!
How are they coming?
Good.
Give me another thousand like them and we can march on Rome.
Come on, once again.
Here, on Vesuvius, we're safe from attack while we organize ourselves into an army.
It may take six months, a year.
Once we're strong, we're gonna fight our way south to the sea.
We're going to arrange for ships with the Cilician pirates.
The sea will be our road home.
If you agree, you may join us.
If you don't agree, go back before your escape is discovered.
Too many women.
What's wrong with women?
Where would you be now, you lout, if some woman hadn't fought all the pains of hell to get you into this accursed world?
I can handle a knife in the dark as well as anyone.
I can cast spells and brew poisons.
I have made the death shrouds for seven Roman masters.
I want to see
Spartacus.
All right, grandmother.
I'm Spartacus.
Stay with us.
We'll need a million Roman shrouds before we're through.
Where do you come from?
Most of us come from the estate of Lillius.
What kind of work did you do there?
Sixteen years a carpenter, a mason.
Good.
We can use carpenters.
What kind of work did you do?
Chief steward.
You'll help with the food supplies. Report to Patullus.
What kind of work did you do?
Singer of songs.
Singer of songs?
But what work did you do?
That's my work.
I also juggle.
Juggle.
What else do you do?
I can do feats of magic.
Magic?
Maybe he can make the Romans disappear.
I'll need one volunteer, man or woman.
How about you?
You, sir?
Here we have a likely subject.
You'll notice there is nothing in my hand, true?
How many fingers do you see?
Three.
How many fingers do you see?
Three.
I make a bowl. My hand is upside down and I ask you to blow at it.
Not hard enough.
Hard!
Thank you.
Would you like to try?
Hit it against the rock, gently.
Poet, I haven't had an egg in days.
You haven't?
Here.
Thank you.
I'm not going to let mine get away.
Sing us a song.
Sing us a song,
Antoninus.
Sing, Antoninus.
When the blazing sun hangs low in the western sky, when the wind dies away on the mountain, when the song of the meadowlark turns still, when the field locust clicks no more in the field, and the sea foam sleeps like a maiden at rest, and twilight touches the shape of the wondering earth,
I turn home.
Through blue shadows and purple woods,
I turn home.
I turn to the place that I was born, to the mother who bore me and the father who taught me, long ago, long ago, long ago.
Alone am I now, lost and alone in a far, wide, wondering world.
Yet still when the blazing sun hangs low, when the wind dies away and the sea foam sleeps, and twilight touches the wondering earth,
I turn home.
Where'd you learn that song?
My father taught it to me.
I was wrong about you, poet.
You won't learn to kill.
You'll teach us songs.
I came here to fight.
Anyone can learn to fight.
I joined to fight.
What's your name?
Antoninus.
Antoninus.
There's a time for fighting and a time for singing.
Now you teach us to sing.
Sing, Antoninus.
When the blazing sun hangs low in the western sky...
You like him, don't you?
Who wants to fight?
An animal can learn to fight.
But to sing beautiful things and make people believe them...
Hmm.
What are you thinking about?
I'm free.
And what do I know?
I don't even know how to read.
You know things that can't be taught.
I know nothing.
Nothing.
And I want to know.
I want to...
I want to know.
Know what?
Everything.
Why a star falls and a bird doesn't.
Where the sun goes at night.
Why the moon changes shape.
I want to know where the wind comes from.
The wind begins in a cave.
Far to the north, a young god sleeps in that cave.
He dreams of a girl and he sighs, and the night wind stirs with his breath.
I want to know all about you.
Every line, every curve.
I want to know every part of you.
Every beat of your heart.
Go on about the city of Metapontum.
What garrisons will we find there?
There are two legions in the garrison. Some have been sent south...
Set the litter down there.
Well, where is this slave general?
Dionysius, get the litter bearers out of the rain.
Give them food, a bed and their freedom.
All right, follow me.
We'll pay you for them.
We have no slaves in this camp.
Tigranes Levantus at your service.
My credentials.
Come in.
"To the General of the
Italian slaves called Spartacus
"from Ibar M'hali,
Cilician Governor of Delos. "
Sit down.
"Greetings.
"Word has been received that you wish to embark your armies on the Cilician ships
"from the Italian port of Brundusium.
"Receive my agent,
Tigranes... "
Levantus.
"... who bargains in my name.
"May Isis and Serapis bring victory to your cause.
"The Governor of Delos. "
Who are
Isis and Serapis?
Gods of the East.
Why should they want us to win?
Because they favor Cilicia, and Cilicia, like you, fights against the Romans.
Would you like some wine?
I drink only after the bargain has been concluded, never before.
How many ships do these Cilicians have?
Five hundred, at least.
But no deal is too small,
I assure you.
We'll need them all.
All?
What is the price?
Price is
100,000 sesterces per ship.
For 500 ships, that would be
50 million sesterces.
You have such a sum?
We will have.
See for yourself.
Beautiful.
When will the ships be ready?
Beautiful.
I love to see such beauty.
When will the ships be ready?
Ah, my friend, when will you be ready?
How long will it take you to cross one-third the length of Italy fighting a major battle in every town?
One year?
Two years?
If we're not in Brundusium seven months from now, we'll never be there.
What if we assemble the ships, and there is no longer a slave army to board them?
We'll give you a chest of treasure now, the rest when we get to Brundusium.
This one?
Yes.
Done!
Seven months from now the ships will be assembled.
Arrange to have the chest loaded.
And now, with your permission,
I should like to have the wine you offered me.
Will you join me?
I will.
Excellent workmanship.
It came from the estate of a wealthy nobleman.
I've heard that you are of noble birth yourself.
I'm the son and grandson of slaves.
I knew that, when I saw you couldn't read.
Of course, it pleases Roman vanity to think that you are noble.
They shrink from the idea of fighting mere slaves, especially a man like Crassus.
You know him?
I entertained him one afternoon.
You?
In the arena.
Excellent wine.
May I...
May I ask you something?
You can ask.
Surely you know you're going to lose, don't you?
You have no chance.
At this very moment, six cohorts of the garrison of Rome are approaching this position.
What are you going to do?
We'll decide that when they get here.
Let me put it differently.
If you looked into a magic crystal and you saw your army destroyed and yourself dead, if you saw that in the future, as I'm sure you're seeing it now, would you continue to fight?
Yes.
Knowing that you must lose?
Knowing we can't.
All men lose when they die.
And all men die, but a slave and a free man lose different things.
They both lose life.
When a free man dies, he loses the pleasure of life.
A slave loses his pain.
Death is the only freedom a slave knows.
That's why he's not afraid of it.
That's why we'll win.
Spartacus, that pirate was right.
The garrison of Rome, they're setting up camp.
How many are there?
About six cohorts.
Where?
At the mouth of the valley, against the cliffs.
Strong camp?
They've built no stockade.
No stockade?
Are you sure?
I'm very sure.
This campaign is great sport for them.
The Romans are having a picnic.
Did they see you?
No. We were hidden.
Maybe we ought to join this Roman picnic.
Form your men.
Six cohorts.
A lot of arms and weapons to build our army with.
Crixus always wanted to march on Rome.
Now he doesn't have to.
Rome's come to us.
Half this way!
The rest over there.
Stand up, the way a noble Roman should!
That's Roman pride for you!
That's better.
What's your name?
Marcus Glabrus.
Glabrus.
Commander of the garrison of Rome.
Commander?
He was commanding it on his belly when we found him, playing dead!
You disappoint me,
Marcus Glabrus.
Playing dead.
You afraid to die?
It's easy to die.
Haven't you seen enough gladiators in the arena to see how easy it is to die?
Of course you have.
What are you...
What are you going to do to me?
I don't know.
What should we do with him?
Let's have a matched pair, him and me.
I'll not fight like a gladiator!
You keep staring at this.
Do you recognize this baton?
Yes!
You should!
It was in your tent.
The symbol of the Senate.
All the power of Rome!
That's the power of Rome!
Take that back to your Senate.
Tell them you and that broken stick is all that's left of the garrison of Rome!
Tell them we want nothing from Rome.
Nothing, except our freedom!
All we want is to get out of this damn country!
We're marching south to the sea.
And we'll smash every army they send against us.
Put him on a horse!
Their leader said their hatred of Rome was such that all they wished was to escape from her rule.
If unopposed, he promised a peaceful march to the sea.
If opposed, he threatens to ravage the countryside and destroy every legion sent against him.
And once they get to the sea?
They plan to take ship with Cilician pirates and return to their homes.
From which port do they propose to embark?
I don't know.
But city garrisons can't stand up to them.
If they are to be intercepted, it's work for the legions!
What sort of a man is this leader of the slaves?
I don't know.
I think they called him Spartacus.
Spartacus.
Is that name familiar to you?
Yes, it does seem to be.
I can't place it.
After he talked to you, what happened?
I was tied to a horse and lashed out of camp.
How many of your company escaped?
Fourteen have reported thus far.
I, myself, was taken prisoner in my own command tent.
The camp was thoroughly infiltrated before an alarm could be sounded.
Did you surround your camp with moat and stockade?
No.
We arrived after sunset. Sentries were posted every 10 paces.
There was no reason to expect an attack by night.
Then again, well, they...
Continue.
They were only slaves.
I see.
I submit that Publius Marcus Glabrus has disgraced the arms of Rome.
Let the punishment of the Senate be pronounced.
If we punished every commander who made a fool of himself, we wouldn't have anyone left above the rank of centurion.
But this is a case of criminal carelessness!
Six cohorts have been slaughtered.
Crassus sponsored this young man. Let him pronounce sentence.
The punishment is well-known!
Let Publius Marcus Glabrus be denied fire, water, food and shelter for a distance of 400 miles in all directions from the city of Rome.
One thing more.
Glabrus is my friend and I will not dissociate myself from his disgrace.
I now lay down the command of my legions and retire to private life.
Goodbye, Crassus.
This is no time for a man of honor to withdraw from public affairs!
All: Shame, shame!
Sit down.
This sort of heroic public behavior is nothing new.
I've seen it before, and I know the meaning of it.
Crassus acted on a point of honor!
Patrician honor!
No matter how noble this looks from the outside,
I don't like the color of it.
Crassus is the only man in Rome who hasn't yielded to republican corruption and never will!
I'll take a little republican corruption along with a little republican freedom but I won't take the dictatorship of Crassus and no freedom at all!
That's what he's out for and that's why he'll be back.
To the mother that bore me, to the father that taught me, to the god...
To the blue woods and the purple shadows, I...
To blue shadows and purple woods.
Spartacus, you frightened me!
I'm sorry.
How long have you been there?
A little while.
Why didn't you say something?
You seemed so happy.
I didn't want to bother you.
I am happy.
Spartacus, I've been trying to remember the song that Antoninus sang.
Is it blue shadows and purple woods, or is it purple woods and blue shadows?
I want to make love to my wife!
Spartacus, put me down.
I'm dripping!
I don't care.
You've got, you've...
Yes?
You have to be gentle with me.
Why?
Why, darling?
I'm going to have a baby.
Now put me down.
What?
A baby.
A baby? When?
In the spring.
Well, how? I mean, how do you know?
I know.
A baby in the spring.
I'm gonna have a son.
It might be a daughter.
Why didn't you tell me?
I just did.
You're cold.
Here, get underneath this.
Did I hurt you?
No, you didn't.
I didn't mean to be so rough.
Why don't you kiss me?
This is the first time I was ever going to have a baby.
Varinia.
A baby.
I'm just the same as I ever was, Spartacus.
I won't break.
These slaves have already cost us a thousand million sesterces.
If now they want to relieve us of their unwelcome presence, let them go!
Lmpossible.
They've infected half of
Italy with this uprising.
If we permit them to escape, this will spread throughout the entire empire.
The Republic is still weak from 20 years of civil strife.
We're engaged in two wars, one in Spain and the other in Asia.
Pirates have cut off our Egyptian grain supply, and Spartacus raids the commerce of all south Italy.
Half the precincts of Rome are without bread!
The city is close to panic.
There are two things we must do immediately!
Confirm Caesar as permanent commander of the garrison
And...
And assign two legions to intercept and destroy Spartacus at the city of Metapontum!
If we could only have had
Batiatus in the other pot!
Now you're talking!
Varinia, wonderful meal.
Varinia.
A small piece of land with a few goats on it.
Oh, no, no.
I don't care.
The best wine in the world.
For wine, you've got to go to Aquitania.
Come to Lidya for wine.
That's the best.
The best wine comes from Greece.
Everybody knows that, even the Romans!
No, Lidya!
You're all wrong!
The best wine comes from home, wherever it is.
I agree with you.
Gentlemen.
Any reports on Metapontum?
Heralds are crying the news now.
We lost 10,000 men, including
Commodius and his officers.
Nineteen thousand?
Have you estates in Metapontum?
No.
A son with Commodius.
With your permission, good day.
We take five years to train a legion.
How can this Spartacus train an army in seven months?
There's something wrong, something very wrong.
We should have an investigation.
By all means, an investigation.
Where is
Spartacus now?
He's nearing the seaport of Brundusium.
I need a few moments of the Commander's time.
Will you excuse us?
I hear you've taken a house in the fourth ward.
Not a very splendid house.
And you feasted 11,000 plebeians in the Field of Mars.
It scarcely could've been called a feast.
For 200 years, your family and mine have been members of the Equestrian Order and the Patrician Party, servants and rulers of Rome.
Why have you left us for Gracchus and the mob?
I've left no one, least of all Rome.
But this much I've learned from Gracchus, Rome is the mob.
No!
Rome is an eternal thought in the mind of God.
I had no idea you'd grown religious.
That doesn't matter.
If there were no gods at all,
I'd revere them.
If there were no Rome,
I'd dream of her as I want you to do.
I want you to come back to your own kind.
I beg you to.
Is it me you want, or is it the garrison?
Both.
Tell me frankly.
If you were I, would you take the field against Spartacus?
Of course.
Why?
We have no other choice if we're to save Rome.
Ah, Caesar!
Which Rome?
Theirs or ours?
You know Gracchus is my friend.
I won't betray him.
Caesar?
Which is worse? To betray a friend or betray Rome herself?
My dear Crassus,
I face no such choice.
You will, sooner than you think.
Good afternoon, Crassus.
I've been looking for you.
Your new master.
The Senate's been in session all day over this business with Spartacus.
We've got eight legions and no one to lead them.
The minute you offer the general's command, they start wheezing like winded mules.
I've seen such epidemics before, haven't you?
How's your health?
Excellent, as you very well know.
I take it the Senate's now offering the command to me.
You've been expecting it.
I have.
Have you thought how costly my services might be?
We buy everything else these days.
No reason why we shouldn't be charged for patriotism.
What's your fee?
My election as First Consul, command of all the legions of Italy, and the abolition of senatorial authority over the courts.
Dictatorship.
Order.
Let me know if my terms are acceptable.
I can tell you now.
They're unacceptable.
For the present, perhaps, but times change and so does the Senate.
When that day comes,
I shall be ready.
Convey my respects to your wife.
With pleasure.
He's right, you know.
If something isn't done about
Spartacus, the Senate will change.
And Crassus will save Rome from the slave army by assuming dictatorship.
But that depends on which way
Spartacus jumps.
Just now he's trying to get out of Italy.
If he succeeds, the crisis is over and Crassus may stay in retirement indefinitely.
I've arranged for Spartacus to escape from Italy.
What?
I've made a little deal with the Cilician pirates.
I've assured them that we won't interfere if they transport Spartacus and his slaves out of Italy.
So now we deal with pirates.
We bargain with criminals.
Don't be so stiff-necked.
Politics is a practical profession.
If a criminal has what you want, you do business with him.
How far are we from Brundusium?
About
20 miles.
Our army will camp here tonight.
They're six hours behind us.
Patullus, ride ahead to
Brundusium. Bring Tigranes here.
Marco, report back to Spartacus.
Tell him we camp tonight by the sea!
If all goes well, we can load
150 ships a day.
That's your job, Dionysius.
Work with the Cilician pirates.
That ought to keep him busy.
Saves me finding someplace to sleep.
Crixus, keep giving me reports on Pompey.
There won't be any surprises.
I still want patrols up to the time we call them to board ship.
I'll get them together.
Spartacus, the harbor district in
Brundusium has food warehouses, but not enough to provide for the whole fleet.
The countryside's filled with cattle.
We've salt to preserve them.
I'll handle it.
Find out how many men we have in camp who were galley slaves or sailors.
Tigranes Levantus.
Ah!
My dear General.
Welcome, Tigranes.
No, no. You needn't look for litter bearers to emancipate. I rode a horse.
Your gods, Isis and Serapis must've been good to us.
The balance of the 50 million sesterces we owe you.
General, I...
I bear a heavy burden of evil tidings.
What is it?
Pompey and his army has landed in Italy.
At the port of Rhegium three days ago.
We get complete reports on their movements.
But do you also know that a Roman fleet carrying Lucullus and his army arrives tomorrow at Brundusium?
Lucullus, here?
You have no ships.
I saw them in the harbor.
The Cilician fleet, out of strategic necessity, has been obliged to withdraw.
Withdraw?
There are no ships at all?
Cilician pirates can destroy any Roman fleet that ever sailed.
If they run away now, it's not because they're afraid!
You better give me a better reason.
I'm as desolated as you are, General.
Stand up. Up!
On your toes.
You'll cut the skin.
Why did the Cilicians run away?
They were paid.
And who paid them?
Who?
Crassus.
Crassus.
Crassus won't fight us himself.
The reports say he won't take the command of an army.
Why would he bribe your pirates to keep us from escaping?
I don't know.
How can I answer, when there is no answer?
I've been betrayed just as you have.
There is an answer.
There must be an answer to everything.
Five miles from Brundusium.
Here's Rhegium.
Pompey's march must've brought him to about here.
He's four days away, maybe more.
Lucullus lands at Brundusium tomorrow.
If we engage Lucullus,
Pompey will have time to march against our rear.
If we turn west to meet Pompey,
Lucullus will march against our rear.
The only other army in all of Italy is here.
Rome.
Yes, of course!
Crassus is inviting us to march on Rome, so he can take the field against us.
Crassus wants us to march on Rome?
He's forcing us to.
He knows I won't let myself be trapped between two armies with my back to the sea.
He knows my only other choice is Rome.
Somewhere on the way, we meet.
If he beats us, he becomes the savior of Rome, and there's his final victory over the Senate.
General, allow me to redeem myself in your eyes.
For a small commission,
I can arrange for you, your family and your leaders, of course, to be smuggled out of Italy and transported to one of the eastern countries where men like you are welcome and appreciated.
You can live like kings for the rest of your lives.
What do you think,
General?
Go away.
Go away?
Go away.
Tell the trumpeters to sound assembly.
Tonight, a Roman army lands in the harbor of Brundusium.
Another army is approaching us from the west.
Between them, they hope to trap us here, against the sea.
The Cilician pirates have betrayed us. We have no ships.
"By order of the Senate
"be it known that we have this day elected
"Marcus Licinius Crassus
"First Consul of the Republic
"and Commander-in-Chief of the armies of Rome. "
Hail Crassus!
Rome will not allow us to escape from Italy.
We have no choice but to march against Rome herself and end this war the only way it could have ended.
By freeing every slave in Italy.
I promise you a new Rome, a new Italy and a new empire.
I promise the destruction of the slave army and the restoration of order throughout all our territories.
I'd rather be here, a free man among brothers, facing a long march and a hard fight, than to be the richest citizen of Rome, fat with food he didn't work for, and surrounded by slaves.
I promise the living body of Spartacus for whatever punishment you may deem fit.
That, or his head.
This I vow by the spirits of all my forefathers.
This I have sworn in the temple that guards their bones.
Hail Crassus!
We've traveled a long ways together.
We've fought many battles and won great victories.
Now instead of taking ship for our homes across the sea, we must fight again.
Maybe there's no peace in this world, for us or for anyone else.
I don't know.
But I do know that as long as we live, we must stay true to ourselves.
I do know that we're brothers.
And I know that we're free.
We march tonight!
Hail Crassus!
Hail Crassus!
Greetings to you,
Crassus.
Caius. Gentlemen.
Have your dispositions been made?
Each maniple knows its position, sir, and exactly what's expected.
Every legion commander has been given his battle orders.
Excellent. All positions will now be changed.
Changed?
Spartacus takes too keen an interest in our plans, I fear.
New battle orders will be issued in a short while.
Spartacus has every reason to believe that he has outdistanced the pursuing armies of Pompey and Lucullus.
However, there are passes through the
Apennine Mountains unknown to any map.
It may fortify your courage to know that Pompey is encamped some 20 miles to the west and that the army of Lucullus approaches from the south by forced night march.
Sir, allow us to pledge you the most glorious victory of your career.
Aye!
I'm not after glory!
I'm after Spartacus.
And, gentlemen,
I mean to have him.
However, this campaign is not alone to kill Spartacus.
It is to kill the legend of Spartacus.
You may go, gentlemen.
Hail Crassus.
Hail Crassus.
Lentulus Batiatus awaits Your Excellency.
Who?
The lanista, sir.
Ah! Admit him.
Most Blessed Highness, as soon as I received your message I hurried into your distinguished presence.
I'm glad you were able to spare the time. Sit down.
Oh, how gracious.
I understand...
I'm informed that Spartacus once trained under your auspices.
Yes!
In fact, if it isn't too subversive to say so,
I made him what he is today.
You're to be congratulated.
You're so admirably qualified to give me what up to now
I've not been able to obtain, a physical description of Spartacus.
Oh, yes.
But you saw him.
What?
In the ring.
When?
When you visited my school with those two charming ladies.
What!
I trust they're both in good health.
They selected him to fight against Draba, the negro.
I remember the negro.
You had good cause to.
If I... If I may say so, a brilliant dagger thrust, difficult angle.
Spartacus was the opponent?
Yes.
What did he look like?
That's a matter of some importance to Your Highness?
Yes, to every man who loves Rome and wishes to see her strong.
We're both Roman patriots. You're a great one. I, of course, smaller.
We both believe in Roman fair play.
You want something from me.
I would be lacking in respect for my conscience, if I did not say that I wish something from you.
Name your price.
If... Uh, no.
When you win your victory tomorrow, presumably the survivors will be auctioned off in order to pay for the expenses of this heroic expedition.
Could not the agent for that sale be he who shares this tiny moment of history with Your Honor?
I authorize you to be the agent for the sale of all survivors.
In return, you will remain here until after the battle and aid me in identifying Spartacus.
After the battle?
Mm-hmm.
You misunderstand me.
I'm a civilian.
I'm even more of a civilian than most civilians.
If you wish to remain so,
I strongly advise you to stay here and be our guest. Guard!
Hmm?
My dear, all-conquering
Marcus Licinius Crassus, what if it is Spartacus who crosses the battlefield looking for you?
In such circumstances, I have no doubt you will be helping him.
This fellow remains with us until after the battle.
Make him comfortable.
Don't let him feel lonely.
Mommy? Mommy?
When do we go home?
Go to sleep, dear.
No pains yet?
He's a bad child.
He hits me with his fists.
He wants to see his mother.
Can you blame him?
Can you feel it?
No, I don't.
I hope he waits till we get to Rome.
Rome.
They've never beaten us yet.
No.
But no matter how many times we beat them, they still seem to have another army to send against us.
And another.
Varinia, it just seems like we've started something that has no ending.
If it ended tomorrow, it would be worth it.
Oh, Varinia, don't make me weak.
You're strong enough to be weak.
Oh, Varinia.
Oh, Varinia,
I love you more than my life.
Yet, sometimes, even with you sleeping beside me
I feel so alone.
I imagine a god for slaves and I pray.
What do you pray for?
I pray for a son who'll be born free.
I pray for the same thing.
Take care of my son,
Varinia.
And if he never knows me, tell him who I was and what we dreamed of.
Tell him the truth. There will be others to tell him lies.
I can't live without you,
Spartacus.
Varinia,
Varinia.
Varinia.
Varinia, for you and me there can be no farewells.
As long as one of us lives, we all live.
I felt it.
Did you feel it?
Yes, I did.
That was so strong.
Does it hurt you?
No.
That was so strong.
Oh, Varinia,
Varinia, Varinia.
Lucullus and Pompey.
Have we a count of prisoners?
We haven't made the final count, sir.
I bring a message from your master,
Marcus Licinius Crassus,
Commander of Italy.
By command of His
Most Merciful Excellency, your lives are to be spared.
Slaves you were and slaves you remain.
But the terrible penalty of crucifixion has been set aside on the single condition that you identify the body or the living person of the slave called Spartacus.
I'm Spartacus!
I'm Spartacus.
I'm Spartacus!
I'm Spartacus!
I'm Spartacus!
I'm Spartacus!
I'm Spartacus.
I'm Spartacus.
Forgive me for being one of the last to congratulate you.
There's an ugly rumor going round the camp that the prisoners are to be crucified.
That is true.
Perhaps this is the moment to remind Your Highness that you promised me I could be the agent in their auctioning.
You promised Spartacus to me!
Where is he?
In return, I promised you the sale of the survivors and there will be none!
But it's Varinia.
Yes, I remember.
You're the woman of Spartacus?
I'm his wife.
And this is his child?
Yes.
Where is Spartacus?
Dead.
Did you see him killed?
Yes.
You're lying.
Where is he?
At least here is someone worth selling, Your Enormity.
I'll even take the child as an investment.
How many women have been taken?
Under 40, sir.
Those who weren't killed have run off to the hills with their children.
You may sell all the others but not this woman.
You haven't seen the others.
They're of surpassing ugliness!
A genius wouldn't be able to sell them.
Flog that scoundrel out of camp.
This woman and her child are to be conveyed to my house in Rome.
Halt them!
Halt!
Antoninus?
Tribune!
Slaves are to be crucified along the roadside the full distance between here and the gates of Rome.
Hold this man till the end.
And that man, too.
March on.
March on!
I've more stripes than a zebra.
Every time I touch my wounds, they sing like larks.
But in spite of that, I found something
I never had before, with all my wealth.
What is that?
Don't laugh at me, but I believe it to be dignity.
In Rome, dignity shortens life even more surely than disease.
The gods must be saving you for some great enterprise.
You think so?
Anyone who believes I'll turn informer for nothing is a fool.
I bore the whip without complaint.
Indeed, that sounds like a bad attack of dignity.
I hope this will not deflect you from the revenge you were going to take on Crassus.
On the contrary, it only strengthens my resolve.
That's enough.
I'm glad to learn that.
This woman, Varinia, is in his house. All Rome knows about it.
Malicious tongues even say that he's in love for the first time.
Yes! Oh.
I noticed a strange look in his eye when he first saw her.
It would take a great woman to make
Crassus fall out of love with himself.
I'll be honest with you.
She's not as unattractive as I told you she was.
Dignity and honesty in one afternoon. I hardly recognize you.
But she is an impossible woman.
Beautiful?
Beautiful?
Well, beautiful.
The more chains you put on her, the less like a slave she looks.
Proud?
Proud, proud.
You feel that she would surrender to the right man which is irritating.
I like Crassus.
Let's save him from his agony.
Let's steal this woman.
Steal the woman? Why?
I can no longer hurt Crassus in the Senate but I can hurt him where he'll feel it most, in his pride.
Attack our enemy from within.
The scheme is excellent, but
I hope you're not suggesting that I steal the woman.
Yes!
Buy some horses and a cart with a canopy.
Bring her here by nightfall.
Oh, no.
Add courage to your newfound virtues.
Would half a million sesterces make you brave?
Half a million?
Well, Crassus does seem to dwindle in the mind, but...
Let's reduce him further.
A round million!
A million.
For such a sum,
I could bribe Jupiter himself!
With a lesser sum,
I have.
Forgive the intrusion. I'm not in the habit of coming uninvited.
You've always been welcome here.
As a pupil.
You're not alone.
No.
This time you've come to teach.
You've joined Crassus?
Am I arrested?
No.
But I must ask you to come with me to the Senate immediately.
What I do, I do not for myself but for Rome.
Rome? Poor, helpless Rome.
Let's go and hear more about Rome from Crassus.
Did you truly believe
500 years of Rome could so easily be delivered into the clutches of a mob?
Already the bodies of 6,000 crucified slaves line the Appian Way.
Tomorrow the last of their companions will fight to the death in the temple of my fathers, as a sacrifice to them.
As those slaves have died, so will your rabble if they falter one instant in loyalty to the new order.
The enemies of the state are known.
Arrests are in progress.
The prisons begin to fill.
In every city and province, lists of the disloyal have been compiled.
Tomorrow they will learn the cost of their terrible folly, their treason.
Where does my name appear on the list of disloyal enemies of the state?
First.
Yet, upon you I have no desire for vengeance.
Your property shall not be touched.
You will retain the rank and title of Roman senator.
A house...
A farmhouse in Picenum has been provided for your exile.
You may take your women with you.
Why am I to be left so conspicuously alive?
Your followers are deluded enough to trust you.
I intend that you shall speak to them tomorrow for the sake of their own good, their peaceful and profitable future.
From time to time thereafter, I may find it useful to bring you back to Rome to continue your duty to her, to calm the envious spirit and the troubled mind.
You will persuade them to accept destiny and order, and trust the gods!
You may go.
Halt!
Why hide behind that stola, hmm?
That's better.
That dress took some weeks of a woman's life.
You, above all people, should respect the work of slaves and wear it proudly.
Come here.
This belonged to a queen, the Queen of Persia.
It's heavy.
In time you will wear it lightly enough.
Sit down.
Will you have some squab and honey?
No.
You'll enjoy it.
And a piece of melon?
And some wine, of course.
Eat.
I did not command you to eat, I invited you.
You find the richness of your surroundings makes conversation difficult?
Why am I here?
Good question.
A woman's question.
I wish the answer could be as good and straightforward.
The infant, it thrives?
He thrives.
I purchased a wet nurse for him, yesterday. I hope the milk agrees with him.
I sent her away.
I prefer to nurse the child myself.
I'm not sure
I approve.
It ties you to the old life.
I want you to begin to look forward to the new.
I don't care about my new life here.
You care about the life of your child, don't you?
Why do you threaten me with my baby?
I belong to you. You can take me anytime you wish.
But I don't want to take you.
I want you to give.
I want your love,
Varinia.
You think by threatening to kill my child you'll make me love you?
I did not threaten to kill your child.
I'm sorry, Varinia.
One shouldn't grieve forever.
I'm not grieving,
I'm remembering.
Do I interfere with your memories?
Oh, no.
You tread the ridge between truth and insult with the skill of a mountain goat.
Well.
What do you remember, when you think about Spartacus?
It doesn't distress you to talk about him?
No.
Well, then, what sort of a man was he, really?
He was a man who began all alone, like an animal.
Yet on the day he died, thousands and thousands would gladly have died in his place.
What was he?
Was he a god?
He wasn't a god.
He was a simple man.
A slave.
I loved him.
He was an outlaw!
A murderer!
An enemy to everything fine and decent that Rome ever built!
Damn you!
You tell me.
Why did you love him?
I can't tell you.
I can't tell you things you can never understand.
But I want to understand.
Don't you see?
I must understand.
You're afraid of him, aren't you?
That's why you want his wife, to soothe your fear by having something he had.
When you're so afraid, nothing can help.
Nothing.
We shall see.
Could we have won,
Spartacus?
Could we ever have won?
Just by fighting them, we won something.
When just one man says
"No, I won't,"
Rome begins to fear.
We were tens of thousands who said no.
That was the wonder of it.
To have seen slaves lift their heads from the dust, to see them rise from their knees, stand tall with a song on their lips, to hear them storm through the mountains shouting, to hear them sing along the plains.
And now they're dead.
Dead.
Varinia dead.
And the baby.
All of them.
Are you afraid to die,
Spartacus?
Hmm.
No more than
I was to be born.
Are you afraid?
Yes.
Hail Consul!
Guard, fall in.
Where are the gladiators?
Over there, sir.
Antoninus, the night passes slowly, doesn't it?
Spartacus.
You are he, aren't you?
Gladiator,
I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus.
You must answer when I speak to you.
Centurion!
Let them fight now.
Unchain them.
The entire city's been told they'll fight tomorrow in the temple of your ancestors.
They will fight now for me. Here!
And to the death. And the victor shall be crucified.
We will test this myth of slave brotherhood.
Unchain them!
Form a circle.
Don't give them the pleasure of a contest.
I'll kill you on the first rush.
I won't let them crucify you.
It's my last order.
Obey it.
Let them begin.
I won't let them crucify you.
Do you realize how long it takes to die on a cross?
I don't care!
Forgive me,
Antoninus.
I love you, Spartacus, as I loved my own father.
I love you like my son that I'll never see.
Go to sleep.
Here's your victory.
He'll come back.
He'll come back and he'll be millions!
I wonder what
Spartacus would say if he knew that the woman,
Varinia, and her child are slaves in my household?
Yes.
Spartacus.
Crucify him!
I want no grave for him.
No marker.
His body's to be burned and his ashes scattered in secret.
Did you fear him,
Crassus?
Not when I fought him.
I knew he could be beaten.
But now I fear him, even more than I fear you.
Me?
Yes, my dear Caesar.
You!
I don't see the letter here to the leader of the Senate.
Oh, yes. Julia, I don't like the sound of weeping.
This is a happy house.
Please stop.
Oh, there you are. Go away,
Julia! Where have you been?
The city is full of Crassus' legions. We've been hiding.
I don't know Rome as well as I know Capua.
They're arresting everyone.
So this is the woman it took Crassus eight Roman legions to conquer.
I wish I had time to make your acquaintance, my dear.
Unfortunately, we all have to make journeys to different destinations.
Where are we going?
You're going to Aquitania. The governor's one of my innumerable cousins.
Here's a senatorial pass. It's valid in all the known world.
Why do I have to go to Aquitania?
'Cause I asked you to.
It's very good of you,
Gracchus, but I...
Double the money I promised you.
Here's two million sesterces.
Two million?
Here. Articles of freedom for the woman.
And here's a smaller document that I've prepared for the child, befitting its size.
Where are you going?
Hmm?
Oh, to Picenum.
Picenum? That's the dreariest town in Italy.
Will you please leave me?
Come with us. See to it that
I don't misuse the money.
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm a senator.
Will you please go before the soldiers come here?
Oh!
This would really make Crassus jealous.
Go and make my joy complete.
Save your tears now.
Save them for the journey.
Well. Prettier.
Halt!
Identify yourselves, please.
Lentulus Batiatus.
Climb down, please, and identify yourselves.
I object to that tone.
I've got my orders.
Come down and identify yourselves, please.
As I told you, I'm Lentulus
Batiatus, the lanista from Capua.
This...
My sister-in-law.
Lady, please.
She's traveling with her child to Aquitania on a senatorial pass.
Take a look through his baggage.
Not a word, please.
What did you say?
Oh, Spartacus.
Tell the lady no loitering's allowed.
Instantly.
Move on.
Yes.
This is your son.
He's free, Spartacus!
Free!
He's free.
He's free.
He'll remember you, Spartacus, because I'll tell him.
I'll tell him who his father was and what he dreamed of.
Varinia, have mercy on us.
Get in the wagon.
Oh, my love, my life.
Please die, die.
Please, please die, my love.
Oh, God, why can't you die!
Come on. Come on.
Goodbye, my love, my life.
Goodbye, goodbye.
Almost 800 years ago,
a militarygenius came out ofMongolia to conquer halfa world.
He was the son of Yesugei, leader ofa small nomad tribe.
This man of destiny, riding beside me as a young boy,
was called Temujin,
born to rule as the prince of conquerors, Genghis Khan.
Temujin! Temujin!
I wanted you alive,
Yesugei.
I wanted the chieftains of the other tribes to learn how Jamuga of the Merkits punishes those who trespass on his grazing lands.
Harness the horses!
Stay your hand!
Hear my words,
Lord Jamuga.
It has been written in the stars that the man who takes the life of Yesugei's son shall die, and die quickly, and by his own sword.
See for yourself, mighty lord.
'Tis the mark of blood.
What is he called?
Temujin.
"Man of iron."
Then I shall spare him, so that he may witness the death I give his father now.
Temujin!
From this day on, you will wear a collar.
I will have a chang made to put around your neck.
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, get my ball, please.
My ball! Oh!
Come away from him, sister.
What harm has the young man done that he should have to wear a chang?
You've heard Jamuga's orders, so leave him.
Besides, his father was an enemy of our tribe, also.
Now come away.
What are you called?
Temujin.
Why have they put that cruel yoke around your neck?
What are you called?
Bortei.
You will return to the camp,
Princess. Go with your brothers.
I take no orders from you, Jamuga.
As you say, Bortei, not yet.
Dogs must be taught to stay in place.
Sengal.
Give me that.
Now then, man of iron.
Down! Down!
Down! Down!
The Lord Jamuga's brave when a man is yoked.
Kuchluk.
After him, after him!
Temujin!
Temujin!
Geen!
Father Geen!
How did you find me?
I consulted the stars and my...
Hmm?
Besides,
Sengal showed me.
Sengal?
If he was able to talk, he'd tell you that he will be with us from now on.
You may be chieftain of the smallest tribe of the Mongols, but at least it's a start.
It's a good start.
This could house an army.
How safe are we?
The Merkits think that only spirits and ghosts could live up this high.
As long as they continue to believe that, we are safe.
When they discover the truth, where do we go?
East or west?
When that time does come, you will decide.
But this may help you.
Our world is like three great circles.
Here, to the west,
Samarkand and Bukhara, the lands of the Persians.
Rich nations who trade with the white-skinned Christians from beyond the desert.
And here, to the East?
I have not traveled east of the mountains, but I have talked with merchants from the caravans, and they have told me of the great walls, and beyond them, of the kingdom of China.
A land of great cities, where people dress in silks.
Even the men.
And where the merchants go in search of spices and rare woods from the nations beyond the Eastern seas.
And here, in the center?
A barren, empty circle where only Mongols live.
Why should it be barren and empty when it lies in the heartland, between the rich west and the richer east?
Because the tribes like the Merkits, the Salkits, the Tanguts and others are too busy fighting amongst themselves, that's why.
But if they joined together?
The only time that Mongols are joined together is in death.
You know what you said about this being the smallest tribe in existence.
It would be difficult for it to be much smaller.
Then we must make it larger.
Merkits.
What tribe are you?
Salkits.
Now shall we see if the spirits of the wind are for us or against us.
These men, they look like Salkits!
Perhaps because they are Salkits.
Salkits?
Riding with you?
Yes, the Salkits and the Yesugei, together.
Over there,
Lord Temujin, is the caravan road to Tashkent.
In the old days, many battles were fought over it.
But so many of the slaves were killed, there was so little profit.
So, the Treaty of the Slave Trail was signed.
A treaty?
The Shah of Khwarezm imposed a truce.
All have sworn to it.
All observe it.
No warrior is permitted to carry arms here.
Good!
Then we can take our pick without fighting.
Hmm?
You do not understand, Temujin.
A truce was signed.
I did not sign it.
The slaves did not sign it.
But...
Will there be women among the slaves?
Yes, Lord.
Good.
My men have horses and weapons, but no women.
How long do you think they will stay without women?
How long will you?
What is the meaning of this?
The slave caravan is under the protection of the Shah of Khwarezm himself.
Convey the thanks of Lord
Temujin to the Shah.
Temujin?
Temujin!
Katke!
My lord!
I thank the four winds you found me.
Jamuga was selling me for a slave.
Somehow I don't see you as a slave.
In any case, you're free now.
You're all free.
Free?
I said you are all free, my sisters, to continue with this caravan, or to ride with my men back to our camp.
You give them a choice? Women?
Sengal, strike the fetters off these slaves.
This truce has lasted
100 years, barbarian!
The Shah will have your head spiked on the city walls.
Once you're dead, do you really think it matters?
Safe journey to Tashkent, and give our thanks to the Shah!
A miracle!
A miracle!
Oh, thank you.
But if you want to prove your gratitude, give me this woman, huh?
- But she's my wife!
- Oh, take another!
Go on and take another woman!
I give you a horse.
I give you two horses.
No, friend Shan, no woman will be taken against her will.
But, Lord, that's what women are for.
And besides, the best have already been taken.
A wise man does not judge a horse by its saddle markings.
Come, I will choose for you.
Come.
Hey, do you want a husband, Katke?
That?
That's settled, then.
May you have many sons.
It's about time you, too, my lord, had thoughts of sons.
The thoughts I've had in my mind are not for a holy man as you.
Give me time.
Take this and be careful.
Temujin!
Katke!
Bring food and clothes to the Princess.
Prepare another tent for me while I wash.
Wash?
The Lord Temujin, my lady.
Stay, woman.
I did not tell you to go.
That was stupid of you.
You do not seem like a stupid woman.
I am not a stupid woman.
And what did I do that you thought stupid?
You gave an order that was bound to be overruled.
The master who feeds his dog does not expect him to answer to the whistle of any stranger.
I might have thought it of you.
You treat those who serve you as dogs.
Not Katke.
She brought me up as a child.
She did not boast about that,
I promise you.
My lady, anyone else listening to us now would imagine that you were trying to provoke a fight.
But it always needs two to make a quarrel.
Not with me it doesn't!
I like a horse with spirit.
Horses, dogs, animals, all you ever think of?
I can see that was a stupid question.
But if it please you, now that you are here, say what it is you came to say.
I have said what I came to say, but for this.
Deep in my heart if I search for the truth,
I must also say that what drove me most to do what I did was the thought of the rage and anger I have brought to Jamuga.
To steal in the night the woman he had chosen to marry.
Outcast! Slave!
Soon you'll be back in a wooden yoke.
For, born a slave, you'll die a slave!
Born a slave I never was!
Born to rule the Yesugei was always in my stars.
And not only one tribe, but people of many tribes were destined to follow me, to fight my battles, conquer nations.
All this was in my stars.
You...
You, woman, dare provoke my anger.
No!
A hand is the first thing one gives to another.
If I... If I wasn't so ugly-looking with all these tears,
I'd know what to say to you next.
But...
I am ugly-looking, then.
You didn't disagree with me.
You see? You see?
You talk too much, woman.
You never give me a chance to say anything.
My brothers always say that, too.
His camp must be near.
He knows our every move.
And we know nothing of his.
His men appear from nowhere and they disappear like ghosts.
Ghosts who will bleed like any ordinary man when they feel the headman's ax.
As some of you may do, if you don't bring her back, and soon.
To have her stolen out of my own camp, and from under the noses of all of you.
From under the noses of her brothers.
Her brothers.
This is my eldest brother, Subodai.
And Jebai, and Kassar.
My lord Temujin.
My lord and my husband.
No one followed you?
We saw nothing but the stars, heard nothing but the rush of the waterfall.
Despite the poetry,
I'm glad to see you back.
And you, my friends, you are welcome.
And grateful, Lord.
Ready to serve you,
Lord.
Subodai, you have nothing to say?
Only this.
The holy man, he lies.
You said?
I saw something as we climbed the mountainside.
A glow against the sky.
Your fires are banked too high.
Geen.
Prepare to move out.
Leave all the carts but one.
Move on to the east road beyond
Jamuga's camp and wait there.
Bortei!
Bortei!
Bortei!
Temujin!
Back, back.
See to her.
Time is on our side.
It will be hours before Jamuga can reach the sky camp.
He'll have Merkits from the lakes to the plains riding to join him.
Who can travel faster, a horse that needs little to eat, or 100 who must forage wide?
Where do we go?
East. We will be across the river before dawn.
Lord, there is man's work outside.
Leave her with me.
Bortei.
I have shamed you before all men.
Jamuga.
I begged him to kill me.
When do we rest, Lord?
Not before we are certain
Jamuga's given up the chase.
Then let us stop and fight.
I will say when it is time to fight, and not before.
But how long do we keep going east, my lord?
All through the winter, and if necessary, through next winter.
If we keep heading east, we could end up in a land where
I've heard they eat dogs.
Or it might have been people.
According to Geen, it is a land of great wealth.
A vast empire built on knowledge and...
We must have knowledge.
Greetings, friends.
And to you, greetings, warriors.
I am Kam Ling, ambassador of the emperor to the Indias, returning to our court in Peking.
Returning, as you see, is a figure of speech.
It seems you travel without much luck.
First our Manchurian guard deserted us, then the wheel of our cart broke.
Then our driver stole our horses, and the cattle, tiring of our company, followed after them.
One might say that the winds of fortune are blowing somewhat coldly.
You are in dangerous country.
We have heard of one
Temujin and his horsemen, fierce, violent men.
We have no fear for our lives.
We bear letters from our emperor.
It would be far more profitable to hold us to ransom than to murder us.
Why talk of ransom and murder? Sengal!
Show them we mean no harm.
Up!
We are grateful.
If you would tell us what gold you require for your services.
Gold, my lord?
I'm not a merchant.
You overwhelm me.
One last kindness we must beg of you.
A message to the nearest Chinese military post for horses and assistance.
It is about four days' journey.
But that would mean leaving you here unprotected.
We have spare horses we'd be glad to lend you, also, our services as an escort.
An escort?
I have 200 men here, all tried and tested.
And our numbers are soon to be increased.
My wife, she is near her time.
Then she deserves better than to ride in the open like a herdsman.
She shall have the poor comforts of our miserable and unworthy wagon.
Please.
We shall try to make it as serviceable as we can.
Now, this Temujin you spoke of...
Have no fear.
This is the one column he'll never attack.
I have his word for it.
A boy?
A son.
The first child born to the tribe of Yesugai for more than 20 years.
And a boy. My son.
Temujin.
My son, Bortei!
You are my wife, this is my son.
You knew he would be a boy, you always said it.
It had to be.
How else could he follow after me?
The day I first noticed your body growing larger,
I gave orders then to Shan to have a saddle built, a small one, of course, a bow and a sword, all of which bear his name.
Don't torment me.
His name.
My son's name.
Jochi, the founder of our tribe.
Jochi. Jochi.
It's a pretty name.
It is not meant to be pretty.
It is a man's name as befits the leader of our tribe.
Only, by the time he is a man, it will be a nation.
If any man could ever do it, that man is Temujin of the Yesugai.
Temujin of the Mongols.
Men who could build this should rule the world.
So our ancestors thought when they first conceived it.
2,000 miles from the great ocean to the southern mountains.
But, alas, now we cannot rule ourselves, let alone the world.
My lord!
They are friends.
Soldiers of the emperor.
Glass.
Simply reflecting the sun's rays.
But it can carry messages further and faster than the swiftest horseman.
A childish device, but not without usefulness.
Please receive it as an unworthy gift.
One drawback, however,
I should point out.
For reasons which will soon become apparent, it's best not to let such devices fall into the hands of a woman.
All the fat bears should be no match for wolves.
Remember that now.
I shall ask for an audience with the emperor,
I'm sure it will be arranged.
I shall be honored.
The emperor also will be honored.
I'm telling you, they're going to boil us alive and then eat us.
No!
They're only going to wash us.
Wash?
Must be a custom of the country.
Why?
I don't know, but I don't intend to find out.
Well, I do.
Shan! Shan!
I know you're down there. Come out.
I'm only being washed.
Wait!
Our ambassador has told us how much he owes to your skill, bravery and courtesy.
Kam Ling is generous,
Your Majesty.
He has also told us that you are a shrewd and observant man.
That is unusual.
I have always believed that fighting, horses and women were the sole interests of the men of your nation.
Tribes constantly at war with one another cannot be called a nation.
Then we shall do nothing to discourage your quarrels.
As long as you Mongols fight among yourselves,
I and my people should have little to worry us.
Surely a nation as rich and strong as yours has nothing to fear.
Fear?
The Chinese empire knows no such word.
Then what is the purpose of the Great Wall?
The Wall merely ensures that civilization, knowledge, the arts, as we know them, shall survive.
It is there to keep what we have to ourselves.
To keep people in.
To keep me?
I find you profoundly entertaining.
You make such direct and positive statements.
You and your strong, wild men arrive in my city like a rush of wind.
A fresh sort of wind.
We pray to the wind.
Charming.
To the four winds.
Better and better.
We have a game of chance in which the four winds are of paramount importance.
Listen to them.
Did you ever hear anything more delicate or exquisite than their sweet, sad song?
Poetry itself could not be more profound.
Do you write poetry,
Temujin?
I do not.
I have never yet found the time.
Then I shall instruct you.
I myself am a poet.
That is why you were sent here, and this is where you must stay, my friend.
There is destiny in your coming here, believe me.
When you speak of destiny, this is something I must believe.
At last we agree about something.
We shall find many more things in common.
Take the birds away.
Their chattering distracts me.
We must discuss the gods to whom you pray.
Primitive religions have always fascinated me.
And while you exchange your knowledge of military matters,
I shall instruct you in the art of poetry and painting.
I find it difficult to control my impatience,
Your Majesty.
Take it.
It grows heavy.
The one in white.
Have her raise her head.
Tonight I am in the summer palace.
Have her brought to me at midnight.
Prisoners.
Make no mistake about it.
We are prisoners.
In an ivory cage, of course.
We should never have headed for the East.
What else did the emperor say,
Temujin?
It's what he didn't say, that there are over 2,000 men on the walls of Peking, and that our horses have been taken.
Just what do you think we should have done,
Subodai?
You're always so quick with advice.
It is what
I have always said.
If we had not run, but stopped and fought Jamuga, none of us would have to be here now.
None of us.
You have a strong right arm, Subodai, and I like to know it is at my side.
But your mouth is young and it needs training.
With enough training, my brother, you may yet become my strong right arm.
For I have need of another.
This peacock, this emperor, has overlooked one thing.
There is much to be learned here, much that can be used later.
And if this is a prison,
I can think of worse hardships.
Yes. I know I've never eaten so well.
As for me, I even enjoy being clean.
It's not the being clean that you enjoy, it's the washing.
Well, the women are beautiful,
I must say.
All of which the emperor hopes you will learn to appreciate, until soft living is all you are fit for.
Bortei is right.
I do not want any of our men fat and useless.
We will all exercise every morning, for a start.
A Mongol never leaves his blade.
Not unless he is dead.
Just a reminder for you to carry.
Look! Over there!
A signal!
What do they say?
I'm not certain, but it must be urgent.
Take the map away.
It's not only inaccurate, it's inartistic.
Stop them weeping and wailing.
I want advice, not pandemonium.
The situation occasions alarm, it does not merit hysteria.
A ragged army of a few thousand Manchurians have captured the city of Hopeh, that is all.
We also consider that
6,000 Imperial Cavalry were routed and put to flight.
But that is nothing new.
No doubt, in our lifetime, it will happen again.
Prince Temujin.
You and your kinsmen seem amused at the news of our disaster.
Not at the news,
Your Majesty, only at the way you receive it.
A few thousand Manchurians are of little account, admittedly.
But their example might be serious.
Others might also realize that the Great Wall means nothing.
I wish to speak to my friend,
Prince Temujin, alone.
Bring hot wine and tea.
Do you stay and keep us company.
This is how I relax in moments of disaster and anguish.
I find painting has a soothing and calming property.
I see that you paint very well.
You are no beginner.
He is hinting that we are accustomed to disaster.
I fear we've underrated our friend.
He has an unexpected gift of subtlety.
Oh. The Shamsu is a rice wine of great delicacy.
May I offer you some?
For me, the tea.
For me, the wine.
I was not suspicious of it, Majesty, but I have forbidden it to my men to drink, as you probably have heard.
I have heard.
And if my curiosity does not greatly offend, why?
Because I wanted my men to be ready for a day such as this.
Ah! Please to continue.
I am listening.
These Manchu...
It is just that the fate of an empire is of small importance compared to a poem by Tso Ling, or a painting by my distinguished ancestor,
Mao Kung.
You were saying?
You would save much time if you let me say something.
That means you have something to offer.
What?
These Manchurian invaders, you'd like them destroyed as soon as possible?
Unfortunately, my army has melted away.
I will raise you another one.
Mongols?
How much?
You mean money?
What else do soldiers fight for?
A large chest of gold for each of my three brothers-in-law, so that I can send them out to recruit only the best men.
How could I be sure I was not just replacing one army of invaders with another?
You cannot be sure.
There is a solution,
Great One.
I myself, who know him better, would trust Temujin.
But if he were to leave his wife and son as hostages in your keeping...
I agree.
See that Prince Temujin has all the gold he needs.
And we will offer a special reward for which one of your wife's brothers does most to help us.
There is no need.
It is a custom, and a charming one, to announce the reward before the service is performed.
In our experience, it often helps with the accomplishment.
Have the court brought back.
I wish them to see how tired and exhausted their emperor is, working devotedly in the service of his people.
I will do so, Great Emperor, but as Temujin and I have so much to do...
Very well. In any case, you've both seen the state I'm in.
Where's he taking us?
The horses are ready.
Why can't we be on our way?
Because the emperor wants you to take a memory with you, a vision that will bring you back all the sooner.
Look at the picture.
The Princess Chin Yu.
Emperor's youngest daughter.
Whichever one of you returns with the best company of horsemen, he shall have her.
Is there any reason we can't start now?
Subodai.
Teach her to be a woman while I'm away.
They're less than an hour back.
Jamuga leads them.
See to your men.
Now!
Your troops will lead the attack, up through there.
It is only fitting we have the honor.
You will not attack with any great success.
You will then fall back.
Retreat?
You have had some experience of that,
I imagine.
But we lose face.
Better to lose face than your head, as the unsuccessful defender of Hopeh has apparently done.
When you fall back through here, my Mongols will fall on them from both flanks.
Then you will lead your troops back again at my command.
Now get your men into position.
I will tell you when to move forward.
Jamuga.
Halt!
A quick death would be too easy.
You can choose.
Either you live to follow the banner of Temujin, or you die with your leaders.
Now, show them to me, these men who led you into rebellion against your empire.
Subodai.
Jamuga.
You will pray for death.
When the chang you wear grows heavier and heavier, and the laughter it brings grows louder and louder.
And you, Temujin, will live to regret this day when you withheld the blade from my neck.
The barbarian of all barbarians.
The Mongol who led the Manchurians.
And it is fitting that his punishment be far greater than for those whose heads I have brought you.
The Lord Jamuga,
Your Majesty.
"In celebration of the Lord
Temujin's great victories
"over the Manchurian rebel invaders,
"it is our will that from this day on,
"he will be called the
Prince of Conquerors,
"the Genghis Khan!"
Genghis Khan!
Genghis Khan!
Genghis Khan! Genghis Khan!
Genghis Khan!
Spare us, Lord.
We meant it only to be a salute to your victory.
How did the thunder crash at your command?
It is a simple alchemist's trick.
But we used too much black powder.
Black powder.
Come to me tonight.
And bring some of your powder with you.
I want to see how you make it thunder.
They make lightning this time, but no thunder.
That is something we've discovered in their experiments.
It thunders only when confined in a container.
Then it can hurl a stone even further than the longest bow shot.
Shall we demonstrate?
So far you have used this only to make noises of welcome?
And sometimes to make pretty effects and fire and sparks to amuse the children.
We have many variations.
I can tell what you are thinking.
It is your duty, both as a holy man and as a man of wisdom, to profit from all this knowledge.
Do you want something?
Give me that blue horse, will you?
Come. Come.
And I tell you again, it has to be done.
As long as this man lives, none of his tribe will join with you.
They can't.
You know their laws, and our laws, too.
To kill him would be an act of mercy.
Oh, I'm not talking of mercy, but of common sense.
Listen to me, Temujin.
Hear me well, and one day remember that I warned you.
There are only two things you can do with Jamuga.
Put him under the ground for all time, or put him at your side and have the Merkits ride with you.
Are you out of your mind, woman?
Jamuga, who killed my father, kept me in chains, or is all this forgotten?
All forgiven?
And you, the scar he put on your back, has that also disappeared with the passing of time?
Neither the scar on my back, nor the memories of how it came there.
No, Temujin.
These I don't forget.
Nor the hatred
I have for this man.
And yet, to help you make what you want come true, to make our people into a nation,
I could set aside my hatred, because it would be necessary.
Then it shows how little you know of me to think that I could, too.
I know you better than you think.
Break it across your knee, Temujin.
Now the two pieces, together.
I know what you are trying to tell me.
That we are only strong when we are undivided.
And one day, you will listen.
Leave us.
Is it possible for you to be a Mongol first, and only secondly Jamuga, chief of the Merkit tribe?
Has the chang also smothered your tongue?
Not yet.
Perhaps if I wear it as long as you did.
Once, you took the chang off my neck.
Perhaps I can do the same for you.
The price?
There is no price.
Only a dream accomplished.
A unified Mongol nation, not just separate warring tribes.
With the Lord Temujin at its head.
The stars have written it.
Geen, my holy man, tells me this is true.
A Mongol nation will come, Jamuga, it will.
But if the Merkits ride at our side, it will come sooner.
The Merkits need no other tribes to ride beside them.
Behind them,
I should say.
All others fear us already.
Our power, our strength.
Even my death cannot destroy that.
Is your thinking so small that you can only think about yourself?
And what do you think of, then, with this wild dream of yours of a Mongol nation?
And apart from these stars you speak of, what else makes you think you have been chosen to rule?
You will die carrying that chang, Jamuga.
Unless I have your word now that your Merkits ride with us the day we leave China.
And that day is soon.
If I were free from this yoke, my hands would still your jackal breath forever.
Subodai!
Put this animal back in his cage.
Your celestial Majesty...
Kam Ling, have you no heart to interrupt these exquisite little songbirds?
My interruption brings pleasant news.
Oh, very well.
Come here, my little sparrow.
Come and sit beside me.
Go on, if you must.
Genghis Khan has arranged a demonstration tonight, for you and your court, to thank you for all your kindnesses over the years.
Don't tremble, child.
Although divine,
I'm also human.
And as a farewell.
Farewell?
Did you know about this?
They wish to return to their own lands.
I cannot allow it.
I have told you many times of my dream of a united people.
And should it take force to accomplish it,
I have the men now.
And I have trained them well.
And I bought them.
And you are my general,
Genghis Khan.
And their leader.
Kam Ling, you are the Khan's friend.
Not his only one,
I hasten to add.
Do you reason with him, for his own good.
The emperor wants to remind you of your first meeting, what then was said, that the Great Wall of
China is to keep people in.
And that there are 3,000 armed men on the Peking walls, and that we are still prisoners.
Prisoners? Friends.
And what sort of talk is this among friends?
I want no more of it.
I've had a terrible day.
Headaches, all this caterwauling.
Get away, you unbeautiful little brutes!
All of you.
And now this talk of leaving me.
You've... You've cut me to the heart.
That was not my intention,
I assure you.
I knew you would do nothing to hurt me.
But my demonstration?
There's no reason to abandon it.
We have another saying, another way of suggesting you make the best of things.
It's very apt.
"Better to light one candle than to curse the darkness."
As you say, very apt.
Nevertheless, you will have him watched.
I thought you would be pleased to see
Genghis Khan and his horsemen ride away.
So that one day they may ride back, as conquerors?
The Khan knows us for what we are, rich, but regrettably weak.
What will you do?
The barbarian Temujin brought back from the Manchurian battle...
Jamuga.
Jamuga.
Have him brought to me, in secret.
Your message said it was urgent.
We have no secrets.
Least of all from her.
This is most difficult for me, my lord.
My loyalties must not be misunderstood, but they are for my country, for China, not for any individual, no matter how important or mighty he may be.
I would say these are the sentiments of an honorable man.
The emperor worries.
He fears your leaving.
He is wrong.
He and all in China should fear your staying.
He is a man of subtlety, however, and there is another solution.
Your people stay, you go, on a very long journey, alone.
Oh!
You express yourself beautifully.
But who is to stab me in my back?
The emperor also understands what would happen to our people if one of them should strike you down.
And so...
You've walked too far to stop now.
Our people would be blameless if your assassin were a Mongol.
A Merkit.
Jamuga!
Bring him here.
It would be better if I were not present.
You will stay, my friend.
You will stay.
You'd like this key, eh, Jamuga?
Why not?
With the chang off, you might have had a chance to save your right arm.
Assassin!
Cut him down.
So he still can't be found.
The one man who can gather all the
Merkits against us, the one man.
Call off your men.
Get them ready for tonight's celebrations.
With Jamuga still at large?
He will do nothing now.
His own escape is more important to him than my life.
And no more failures this time, Subodai.
Our plan for tonight must meet with success.
I'm sorry you will miss tonight's celebrations.
But perhaps you can see some of the fireworks from here.
Amazing, the ingenuity of the human mind.
The Chinese mind, of course.
You are a true artist,
Prince Temujin.
I knew it from the first day.
My profound felicitations.
And now for our final display.
Final?
Perhaps you would like to set it off.
It would be an honor.
This last one will be very special.
You have saved the best for the last. A wise move.
A touch of true delicacy.
As you yourself said, "Better to light one candle than to curse the darkness."
This will be our camp.
My lord!
Here.
How long do you intend to hold me prisoner?
Not prisoner.
As your late emperor said to me while plotting my murder, you are here as a friend.
In that case,
I can only ask that my death be a swift one.
We will not speak of dying, friend.
Only a fool destroys a wise man.
You will sit at my right hand and you will counsel me.
And I will listen to your words.
And if your words be wise, they will make me wise, too.
I will accept this honorable appointment because I'm happy to serve a lord whose star grows brighter while the sun of China fades.
In addition,
I suspect I will find the work more agreeable than death.
My first advice is to strike swiftly, to take what is left of China before someone else can do so.
Word of this success will bring other tribes to you in increasing numbers.
In the meantime...
In the meantime, we shall move westward.
With China safely in the hands of Jebai,
Subodai will move north into Russia, while Kassar drives south to bring India to her knees.
Samarkand and Bukhara will fall easily to us, and Persia will be ours for the taking.
And the Mongols shall rule from the heartland, from the very center of the world.
And Jamuga?
The Merkits will still have their chance to join us.
Mongol must not fight Mongol again.
Your ambition destroys your honor.
Is the man who raped our sister to go unanswered?
Is the father of his first-born son to go unpunished?
Jochi is my son.
The man who lets personal revenge take precedence over the tasks before him will never complete those tasks, and he will lose all that he has gained.
Stop!
My word is the law.
Now get on with my work.
Subodai is a small man.
They are all small men.
Why are there no men of stature, no men of imagination?
It is not easy to match a true conqueror.
Perhaps once in many centuries does the world produce a man with the power and the will equal to his vision and destiny.
Perhaps Temujin,
Genghis Khan, is such a man.
This was not said in flattery, my lord, I promise you.
Leave me.
Jamuga.
In the next few years, the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan
seized all of China north of the Yellow River,
carved its way across the
Ural Mountains into Russia
and plunged southward across the borders oflndia.
Having conquered almost all ofAsia,
Temujin turned his armies towards Samarkand and Bukhara.
And when they were his,
the great Persian empire of Khwarezm lay before him, ready for his sword.
Come now, Jamuga.
You are an old general.
You know very well that even if I agreed to join forces with you, you could never hope to defeat this...
Genghis... This Khan.
No one else has.
No one else has an army equal in strength to our combined forces.
We will be more than enough to slaughter him.
Ah, I have no desire for slaughter.
Lamb is for slaughter.
This meat is very sweet and succulent.
No, no, I hear more and more men flock to his banner every day.
Defeated men, weaklings.
The first to run in battle.
But I have not offended him.
He has offended you.
Years ago, that caravan on the slave trail, his violation of the treaty.
Oh, that was when...
That was when the supply from the East was cut off.
No spices, no jewels, no women.
And remember this.
Your country lies directly in his path.
Your only hope of saving Khwarezm, of saving yourself, is to align yourself with me.
There is only one way to stop this violator of treaties.
You and I will ride together against this Genghis Khan.
We will crush this wolf, this thirster after blood, this corrupt defiler of women, this scavenger.
Your serenity speaks words of wisdom.
A gift shall seal our bargain.
One of my daughters?
Two?
And my gift to you will be the head of this Genghis Khan.
The armies of the Shah and Jamuga are joined and on the march.
They have already crossed the Yalu river.
Then the time is here, finally.
You are quite certain?
There can be no mistake?
There's no mistake.
The last word placed him five days away.
We will have the high ground.
He will have to come to us.
"We will have the high ground," you said.
"They will have to come to us," you said.
And are they not doing so?
An emissary with a white flag.
Well, somehow,
I do not feel they've come to surrender.
Not with Genghis Khan holding the high ground, with our troops outnumbered.
Are you suggesting that we surrender, then?
I'm suggesting nothing.
I'm only regretting the fact that I allowed myself to be dragged into this foolish and obviously risky adventure.
To conquer, one has to take risks.
At my age,
I do not need to take risks.
If we...
If I survive this day, it will have taught me a lesson, that a man can be too clever.
Your words mean more than they say.
I had hoped to see
Mongol kill Mongol, and so wipe themselves out and rid Khwarezm from all danger.
Instead of which?
I find myself on an uncomfortable horse in a drafty place and in a very dangerous situation.
Well, perhaps this emissary brings good news.
I bear greetings from the
Genghis Khan to the Lord Jamuga.
Greetings?
And I thank you deeply for observing my flag of truce.
The Lord Genghis Khan would wish to talk with the Lord Jamuga.
Talk? What would we have to talk about?
I'm only the humble emissary sent to arrange a meeting.
There will be no meeting.
No talk.
Does the Lord Jamuga fear the spoken word?
Tell this jackal you obey, my talking is done with a lance, or a sword.
I'll repeat.
Does the Lord Jamuga fear the spoken word?
And these spoken words are to take place in the center of his camp?
The Genghis Khan will ride forward with an escort of six, then finally alone.
The same privilege is yours.
Can he be trusted?
The word of the Lord Genghis
Khan can always be trusted.
I trust him enough to remain here as hostage until you return.
Then let it be so.
It is only fitting that you have come back to your own land to die.
But it is not fitting that a Mongol should deliver the death blow.
You still sing the same song, Temujin.
Many voices carry it now.
Not the Merkits, outcast!
I asked for this meeting in the hope that Mongol would not shed Mongol blood.
Also, that you might still join with me to spread the name of the Mongol nation.
The Merkits are warriors. Not a group of women to become part of a herd.
We say and do as we want.
And we take what we need.
From anybody!
I promise you this, Jamuga.
The Merkits will ride as part of the Mongol nation, or their land will be razed to the ground.
Razed so that not even a lame horse would stumble walking across it.
I must talk with the Shah.
Counsel is always worthwhile.
We will send you our answer with Kam Ling.
...and the men grow impatient, my lord.
Better that than the spilling of Mongol blood.
Not one of our horses will put one foot forward until I have
Jamuga's answer.
My lord! Look!
Kam Ling.
Take your posts.
Withdraw! Withdraw!
Withdraw!
Retreat!
Get them back!
Get them back!
I have no desire for slaughter.
Retreat!
Merkits!
My lord, Jamuga!
Take the left flank!
With me!
Subodai!
One of you!
Any one of you!
And you first, outcast!
Sengal!
Stay where you are.
Enough, Jamuga.
Let there be peace.
With you? Never!
And there will be no chang this time either, jackal.
If you have the courage to stand up alone to me,
Jamuga, the man who slaughtered your tribe, the father of your first son!
Is this the man you would follow?
Is this the leader who would unite the nation of the Mongols?
You have passed your own sentence.
A Mongol duel?
And when you are dead, Jamuga, your men will ride with mine.
Untie any prisoners.
If any of the Merkit tribe would leave us, let them go now.
I have lived to see it, that the tribes come together as one people.
But it is my sons who will make our nation great.
Show my people their leaders.
And until they are old enough to lead, it is my wife and her two brothers who shall speak for them, shall guide them to walk straight.
Bortei, whom I have always loved, turn me towards the wind.
I want that the gods should see me in the face.
So many tears, but not one tear from you.
There will be many years for weeping.
I want you to see me as you have always.
Always your hand to help me.
As you said, it's always the first thing you'll hold out to another.
The first.
And strangely, at this time, that it should also be the...
And so it was that Temujin, the Genghis Khan, was dead,
but not the tide he set in motion.
His dream conquered even after death.
His sons rolled westward into the Hungarian plains,
burned a path to the borders ofEgypt.
One grandson founded the
Mughal dynasty oflndia,
while another was the great Kublai Khan,
Emperor of China.
And when the conquest was finished,
half the population of the world was contained in the Mongol Empire.
The empire born in the imagination of the prince of conquerors,
Genghis Khan.
Peking - China.
The summer of the year 1900.
The rains are late, the crops have failed, a hundred million
Chinese are hungry and a violent wind of discontent disturbs the land.
Within the foreign compound a thousand foreigners live and work, citizens of a dozen far-off nations.
Priests and missionaries, bankers and businessmen, engineers and adventurers, diplomats, soldiers and students...
People with families, homes, jobs.
Many have lived here a lifetime and feel secure as they go about their daily routine.
What is that terrible noise?
Different nations saying the same thing,
We want China.
Sha-shao!
Separated from the compound by only a wall and a gate, is the Forbidden City.
Here, in untouchable isolation lives the Dowager Empress, last of the Manchus.
Protected by an army of eunuchs, she holds court and confers with her ministers, mandarins and generals.
Halt the execution.
But Prince Tuan s orders!
Now you have my orders.
The nightingale will recover.
The Court physician s arts will work.
Only yesterday
I listened to its song.
The execution has been stopped.
Who?
Jung-Lu,
Your Majesty,
I come to ask your displeasure.
My life instead of the Colonel s.
We cannot spare you.
I gave the order to fire on the Boxers.
They were burning missions, killing foreigners.
We have sad news.
The nightingale... it was your gift.
Do you remember, Jung-Lu?
I have not forgotten.
I live to serve Your Majesty.
How does the attack on the Boxers serve
Her Highness?
If they are unchecked, foreign armies will fall
- on China.
- We are tens of millions.
Does the Empress believe that where the imperial Army has failed, the rabble will succeed?
- Our Gods are with the Boxers.
- The nightingale is still.
I hear only the sound of crows.
Your Majesty, a violent wind is short-lived.
The Boxers have arisen like the wind and rain, and like the wind and the rain, will die.
May the Boxers be guided by the will of the gods.
About the Colonel, Your Majesty.
His end will be a sign, and a warning to the foreigners.
His death is of no consequence.
But his life has set my Prince against my General and this disturbs the morning s tranquility.
Let him die for this offense.
You are concerned, Jung-Lu?
If the Boxers fail,
I will give the foreigners
Prince Tuan s head.
Eyes front, soldier.
All right,
Marines, eyes front!
We re almost in Peking, the capital city of China.
This is an ancient, highly cultured civilization, so don’t think you re any better than them because they can t speak English.
A few Chinese words go a long way.
Repeat after me.
The word for yes is shih.
Shih.
- The word for no is poo shih.
- Poo shih. it s the same here as anywhere else in the world, everything has a price.
Pay your money and don’t expect any free samples.
Yes, sir.
Right turn!
Column... Halt!
We going to stop that, Major?
Stay right there!
- Murphy!
- Yes, sir?
Ni hao.
Tell the Boxer chief
I want to do business with him.
I want to buy the old man.
But he's not American.
Twenty dollars.
Hold it!
Tell him the old man must be alive.
Nothing if he s dead.
Forty dollars.
All right.
He s dead.
But he say you pay for spoiling the ceremony.
Nothing doing.
Twenty dollars.
Tell him
I'll still do business.
I'll buy the dead Boxer.
Forty dollars.
Twenty dollars.
- Did you fire that shot?
- Yes, sir.
Nice shooting, Sergeant.
Thank you, Major.
That'll cost you twenty bucks out of your pay.
Fall in!
Alright...
Fall in!
- Take them to the barracks.
- Yes, sir.
- Murphy!
- Sir?
Madame.
Tell her I’m waiting.
I have sent her a note, Excellency.
You re the owner.
Tell her.
Here s your key, Count.
Excellency, please.
As Russian Minister here
I order you to get her down.
As you wish, Excellency.
But remember she is still a guest. I cannot order her.
Excellency, I think you need a cold drink.
- And so do I.
- Champagne, sir?
How are you? it's been a long time.
Natasha!
Baroness Ivanoff!
Yes, Sergei?
You keep me waiting and then ignore me.
You are a little nervous, Sergei.
I suggest something cool for all of us.
Excuse me.
Natasha...
Thank you.
I won t talk about the necklace.
But you are.
- As Russian Minister in Peking...
- Please, Sergei, speak as my brother-in-law.
Natasha,
I've told Bergmann your visa s canceled.
So you cannot stay in this hotel.
Or in Peking or even in China.
- By law you don’t exist.
- That s frightening.
Where will you go?
To your Chinese friends?
How you hate me, don’t you?
No, you re wrong.
I don’t hate you.
Go!
You fool.
Is it my fault, if you lose everything and end up naked in the street...?
Not completely naked.
There s still the necklace.
Today...
- She has to go today.
- Yes, sir.
I'll see to it.
Good evening.
I want a room with a bath this time.
- Have you reserved, sir?
- You're late, Lewis.
Hello.
Hello.
When did you arrive?
- Today.
- Why so late?
We walked the last 10 miles.
Don’t the trains work now?
Gentlemen, the railroad is no more.
- Major Lewis!
- Bergmann.
- Is there a room for me?
- They re all taken.
But if you'll wait
- a short while...
- Fine.
Thanks, Chiang.
Here you are.
Any time you need me.
Half my life s here.
Take care of it.
And more of your life’s here.
Oh, yes.
Let me use the bin.
Wont you open it?
Open it and you must read it.
Then you must answer.
Lewis!
- Ah, Carlo!
- My dear chap!
- Captain.
- You re late.
What kept you?
I lost 2 men.
Had to bury them.
- Come on, let's get a drink.
- Alright.
Try and get a room here too, Andy.
I want to look up the kid.
Ah yes, your little girl.
- How old is she now?
No, she must be 12.
It s a pity. No mother and practically no father.
What can I do?
She s in a French mission for Chinese orphans.
You re better than most.
You do try to see her.
But leaving her in a mission is no way to raise her.
But what do I do?
Take her to Illinois?
How would she make out there?
They'd treat her like a freak.
She s better off among her own kind.
- You really think so?
- Sure.
May I have your key?
I need it for the American officer.
Thank you.
Besides, you have to live your own life.
I've just had an invitation.
Please sit down, Major.
Ask him and we'll drink together.
He d tell us his troubles.
What shall I tell you?
That you're happy I’m here.
You re very direct.
I’m a marine.
I’m short on time.
How much is there for me?
All you want.
Have you found this approach successful?
Not really, no.
I don’t know another.
Keep drinking, Major.
The uniform will hold you.
- Clever women make me nervous.
- No, please...
Please don’t go.
What can I offer you?
My life?
My room.
They gave it to you.
Is that too much to ask?
My life isn't worth much, but hotel rooms here are at a premium.
Do you always offer your life to strangers?
To a soldier, strangers are the best friends.
I’m not in uniform, Major.
Things are fine as they are.
Major Lewis.
A British orderly to see you.
The Minister wishes to see you, sir.
He told me to tell you he s been authorized to act for your Minister.
Fine. Tell him
I'll be right along.
Yes, sir.
Here s you key.
Thanks.
What about your things?
- Put them back.
- But there s only one room.
Let the Baroness figure it out. She s clever.
Don’t laugh yet, Major.
It s a very small room.
I've been in tight places before.
So have I, Major.
- Daddy!
- Teresa!
Daddy!
Daddy!
- Hello, Britten.
- Good day, sir.
Wake up, sentries!
Take a tip from an old soldier.
Whenever you see a Major of the American Marines, you will present arms.
And don't forget it!
If this be I, as I suppose it be, my little dog will know me.
Come in.
I’m, sorry, are you busy?
Of course I am.
I always am.
Busier than usual?
Or just busy?
Both.
Well, what s the pressing female problem?
Just this,
Am I to pack or not to pack?
Do we go to England?
Do we leave this year or not?
I don’t know.
You don’t know...
Pack. If we don’t go, all you need do is unpack.
If men had to do the packing, the world would be different.
- If I had my way...
- What?
We d have packed long since and now be miles away.
We?
A comforting thought.
Thank you, darling.
Will it all go up in flames?
- Not if I can help it.
- What?
I'll put it in a nutshell.
If I encourage the Great Powers to be tough with China,
China will become just another battlefield for them to fight over.
It s wiser to accept temporary humiliation at the hands of the Boxers in the hope that by damping down the fire, the kettle won t boil over.
And then?
I shall probably receive the Government s displeasure, and we'll be retired on an inadequate pension.
Remember what Napoleon said?
I never forget it.
Let China sleep.
' When she wakes, the world will tremble.
He said a lot, didn't he?
Come in.
- Major Lewis, sir.
- Ask him to wait.
Darling, I have to put on my official face.
You haven’t forgotten our soirée?
Twenty-four bottles of champagne are already on ice.
- Anything else the Sahib requires?
- The first waltz.
I'll consider it.
Philip!
Major Lewis, Sir Arthur.
Stand up, sit down, or walk around the room.
I'll walk around.
You please yourself.
I have an unpleasant task to fulfill.
First, congratulations on your initiative this morning.
We were a little late.
Unfortunate that a Chinese was killed.
- A Boxer?
- A Chinese citizen, Major.
You re not in the Wild West now.
You can t shoot
Chinese like red Indians.
No, sir.
Secondly,
I warn you that such irresponsible behaviour, could easily involve us all in a great conflagration.
I understand.
And lastly, since your Minister is suffering from a diplomatic illness, you are required here no longer.
No longer required by whom?
This is a message from your own Legation.
I d be delighted if you stayed.
Yes, sir.
You know all hell s going to break loose?
If it does, it will not be because we have provoked it.
So we'll all just walk soft and hope for the best.
If we walked on our knees, we can t stop it.
I've just marched from Tientsin.
Boxers are everywhere.
Killing white men, missionaries, and all Chinese Christians.
The Imperial Army s doing nothing about it.
Boxers have been around for years.
You re unnecessarily alarmed.
Well, the next time
I see them killing an English priest, I'll try not to be.
I've been a soldier myself.
I understand how you feel.
But my job s to see the larger picture.
I wouldn't know about that.
I just patrol the rice paddies in the back country.
I know this much...
If the Boxers come, we'll need more soldiers in these compounds.
Well, now we’ve both had our say.
I'll go quietly.
Oh, by the way, it s our Queen s birthday.
Tonight we re entertaining.
Why not come?
Thank you.
I won t leave Ming.
I'll pack him in my case.
Don’t be silly.
He d suffocate.
- What s that?
- He d suffocate.
- It s only for five weeks.
- Come on.
May we speak to you, father?
It s very important.
There are no negotiations at the moment. What is it?
Mother says we can't take Ming to England.
- I wont leave my dog.
- He s my dog.
- Who feeds him?
- Who taught him to sit up?
Tell you what.
We'll cut him exactly in two.
You each get a half.
- Father. Don’t play King Solomon.
- Well, I tried.
Atten... shun!
Shoulder... arms!
Present... arms!
Slope... arms!
His Excellency, the Minister of Austria-Hungary and the Baroness Von Riedel.
Welcome, Prince Tuan, to Her Majesty s Legation.
I am deeply honoured.
His Imperial Highness,
Prince Tuan.
I bring greetings from our Empress.
You are most welcome, Highness.
Greeting and felicitations to your great queen.
May the lions of China and Britain live in peace forever.
Our Queen is touched by the words of your illustrious Empress.
Your Imperial Highness,
Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, the first dance will be the Military Two-Step.
Marvellous, fabulous.
They should be around my neck.
Of course, Sophie, you look naked without them.
- Shall we join the line.
- No.
Not yet.
I've waited for this a long time, and I’m enjoying it.
Natasha, you blind us with your glitter.
Would you recognize me without them?
I understand you're going to Tientsin.
That's right, Excellency.
There’s a Russian woman who wishes to leave Peking.
Anyone we know, Sergei?
She d do well to meet you.
It may be her only chance to reach Tientsin.
It might be...
If you disregard me the
Russian government will remember.
- Sir Arthur.
- Evening, Major.
Lady Robertson.
I wanted to thank you personally for trying to help Father Bemish.
You know the Baroness?
Yes, of course.
It s been a long time.
I know my husband has thanked you.
Yes, I've expressed my gratitude.
This is Baroness Ivanoff.
- And Major Lewis.
- Your Highness.
You must be the American who had the encounter with the Boxers this morning.
It was the priest who had the hard time.
My government is most distressed.
But do not conclude that all Boxers are bandits.
Most of them are harmless vagabonds.
Market place entertainers, much like the gypsies in your country.
In fact, Sir Arthur,
I have brought such a troupe to entertain your guests tonight.
Boxers here?
With your permission.
Of course, Your Highness.
He wants you to take this sword and try to strike him.
Try it.
It s part of the performance.
If I kill a Boxer, does that, er... create a diplomatic incident?
There is no danger.
You've made your point.
Not quite.
Bravo!
I guess he wasn't a true believer.
It seems, Sir Arthur, that your troops are invulnerable.
Forgive me, but the Major doesn’t seem to play the game according to Chinese rules.
I apologize, Sir Arthur.
I don’t think he came here tonight to play games.
Good night.
Unfortunately, Sir Arthur,
I must return to my duties at the palace.
No need to escort me.
Ladies and gentlemen, the next dance will be a waltz.
- Aword, Sir Arthur.
- This is an insult to the British and a challenge to all Powers!
Areport will reach the Kaiser.
Her Majesty's Government is not alarmed by this
Boxer invasion of its Embassy.
I shall complain to the Chinese ministry.
What will you do, Sir Arthur?
I intend to have a glass of champagne.
You know,
I admire Sir Arthur.
He makes me think that God must be an Englishman.
We go and we go and we don't get anywhere.
Why not head back to the hotel?
- Are you tired, Major?
- Tired? No.
Ready to turn in? Maybe.
Ever been inside this temple?
Wed get a better drink at the hotel.
Very interesting.
Can we go now?
But we haven’t had our dance yet.
Shall we?
What'll you do in Tientsin?
I'll be entirely in your hands.
You are now but you keep slipping through my fingers.
I think I’ll get you to take me to San Francisco with you.
Why to San Francisco?
It s where they found all the gold.
Just a minute.
What s that trinket worth?
A lot of money.
We won t leave today. They've killed the German Minister.
But Matt, we must leave...
I have to leave.
You have to wait.
Your sword, Sir Arthur.
You are well, Sir Arthur?
If you are, Your Majesty.
- We are pleased to receive you.
- It s an honour,
Your Majesty.
We have been informed of the German Minister s death.
The Boxers will be punished.
But the people s anger cannot be quieted so easily.
The Germans have seized Kiaochow, the Russians Port Arthur.
The French have obtained concessions in Yunnan,
Kwangsi and Kwangtung.
In all, thirteen of the eighteen provinces of China are under foreign control.
Warships occupy our harbors, foreign armies fill our forts, foreign merchants administer our banks, foreign gods disturb the spirits of our ancestors.
Is it surprising our people are aroused?
Please allow me to observe that Boxer violence cannot redress China s grievances.
China is a prostrate cow!
The Powers are butchering her for her meat.
If China is a cow, she is indeed a marvellous animal that gives both meat and milk, but at the same time grows stronger.
She learns
Western arts of peace.
But China s greatest virtue is her patience.
If she exercises that now, she will achieve everything.
And if not?
If not, if violence and impatience prevail, the blood of millions will be shed and the agony be prolonged.
Go to the window, Sir Arthur.
I’ve arranged something for you to see.
Please inform your government that Chinese justice is swift and thorough.
Those men murdered the
German Minister this morning.
Where lies the guilt?
With he who wields the sword or who gives the command?
You know who gave the command?
With your permission,
I d like to present an eyewitness.
By all means,
Sir Arthur.
Major Lewis, Your Majesty.
Evidently, Major, you possess secret information about the Boxer leadership.
It s not much of a secret.
Please go on, Major Lewis.
I saw the Boxer commander this morning.
The one who had the Minister killed.
You would know him?
It was Prince Tuan.
You believe this story?
I do, Your Majesty.
And you ask us to take action against Prince Tuan?
I’ve come here with the truth now known by the German government and the other Powers.
We reject your truth.
And your protest.
We are pleased to inform you that Prince Tuan is our closest adviser.
He now heads the Foreign Office.
For our part, Great Britain wants nothing more than continued friendship with China.
Because of the drought, the hunger and the unrest among my people, of the merciless demands of the foreign powers, the situation in Peking cannot be expected to become tranquil.
Therefore we earnestly advise you that all foreign residents, including diplomatic personnel, should leave Peking within twenty-four hours.
Is Your Majesty informing me that she is severing all diplomatic relations?
Not at all.
Her Majesty was clear enough.
She is offering informal advice for your safety and protection.
- I am in favour of that.
- Major.
She can't control the Boxers.
We d better get out.
Prince Tuan, you will see that these gentlemen are escorted safely to their Legations.
We d do better on our own.
- Do we walk?
- Yes, very slowly.
Keep walking.
Squad!
Double time.
- Thought you d need some help.
- Thank you.
Count the votes.
We're awaiting the American Minister.
Oh, Mr. Maxwell.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Sorry to have got you up, but we need your vote, on staying in Peking or not.
The United States have no territorial concessions in China.
Nor are we interested.
I d better abstain, Sir Arthur.
I understand, Mr. Maxwell.
I just wanted you to be here.
Congratulations, gentlemen.
It's unanimous.
Nine votes in favour of evacuation.
Great Britain has decided to stay.
Alone if necessary.
That s not possible.
We d look ridiculous if we left the British alone in Peking.
Perhaps Britain has its reasons for being the only foreign power in Peking.
Our friend is right.
They may have secret reports.
I’ve made it completely clear.
Admiral Sydney is on his way with several thousand men.
He’ll be here in 9 or 10 days.
Meanwhile, I refuse to worry about the Boxers giving a victory to Prince Tuan.
Then the Germans stay too.
Sir Arthur, we Spaniards fulfill our obligations.
There s no word for flight in our dictionary.
We feel obliged to protect the civilians who depend on us.
I recognize that obligation, Guzmán, and I believe that if we stand united the Chinese won't dare to attack the representatives of 11 great Powers.
If we stand firm, there'll be peace in China and in the whole world.
Spain is with you.
If the other Powers stay, so will Austria.
Congratulations, Sir Arthur.
The British win another bloodless victory.
I take it You’ve unanimously decided to stay?
I shall report that the first vote was9 to 1 and that in a friendly spirit it was then decided to make the decision unanimous.
Well, then I suggest we call in the military.
This way, gentlemen.
Colonel Shiba will give the report.
As to the military aspects, we have agreed that with fewer than 400 men, to defend a 2-mile perimeter, the position is untenable.
We recommend immediate evacuation.
For political reasons the
Ministers say we must remain.
So you must defend the area until Admiral Sydney s forces arrive.
Sir, what if the relief column doesn’t make it?
It s over 70 miles through hostile territory.
We’ll consider that situation when it arises.
We have 5 defense sectors.
The wall defended by the Germans and Americans, the west end, the British Legation, the Fu, held by the Americans and Japanese, and the east end, held by the Italians and French.
- Boxers?
- Yes.
- Where the hell are they?
- All around us.
Their purpose is to make us nervous.
Once the shooting starts You’ll see them outside that wall.
Who's nervous?
No!
You cant have them!
But Sarah, we agreed.
We need the books for barricades.
Not the Set of the Napoleonic Wars.
Mother sent them for your birthday.
I must confess that French history bores me.
English history? Bah!
- Go away. The shop is closed.
- It s Baroness Ivanoff.
I thought all Peking's doors were closed to me, that I d lost face in the Chinese streets.
Our Empress has those same fears, Baroness.
The Boxers.
It is hoped her wisdom will prevail.
I got your message, old one.
Your friend thinks you should leave Peking.
- Which friend, old one?
- General Jung-Lu.
It was not possible before.
We would have been accused of meddling in
Russian affairs.
And now?
Now... it makes no difference.
The Boxers will attack.
If you disappear in the confusion who d be left to point a finger?
At 5 p. m. the fighting will have begun.
You’ll meet a man at the corner of the French Legation.
He’ll be wearing a green peasant jacket.
You will be there?
- Go up on the ramp and take a look.
- Yes, sir.
- I don’t like this.
- Don’t worry.
Tell those men to get their backs into it.
Whoa there.
- Where are you going?
- I’m getting out of Peking.
Those Boxers out there are angry.
- Not with me.
- We have 200 rounds each.
- That s 20 per man per day.
- Enough for warming up.
They d better start out warm.
Yes, sir.
I’ll tell them.
Get out before I get mad!
Mad Americans inside, mad Boxers outside, mad Russians there...
I’ll risk going out.
I split the men in 2 platoons. 4 hours on, 4 hours off.
The sergeant will take the first watch.
Right.
I wanted to go to Tientsin but you prefer to stay.
I wear a uniform.
They pay me for that.
Go on then.
And get out of my way.
Have a nice war, soldier, a real nice war.
Where do these go?
Where do you think?
Get up on that wall!

In June of 1807, in Tilsit, the meeting of the emperors Alexander and Napoleon took place.
In the meantime, life, the actual life of people, with its concerns of health, sickness, work, rest, and the interest people take in thinking, the sciences, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, passion, went on as usual, independently and outside of the political issue of friendship or war with
Napoleon Bonaparte.
January, February, March, April...
Come on, speak, Mama.
This won't do, my dear.
Not everyone can understand your childhood friendship.
Seeing you two being so close may be detrimental to you, and what's more important, it's making him wretched for nothing.
He might have already found a good match, and now he's going crazy.
Is he?
I’ll tell you about myself.
I had a cousin...
I know, Kirill Matveyevich.
But he's an old man.
He was not always old.
I’ll speak to Boris.
He mustn't come so often.
- Why not, if he wants to?
- Because it can't come to anything.
Mama, what nonsense!
All right, I won't marry him, but let him come if we both enjoy it.
Not to be married, but - just so...
- How so, my dear?
- Oh, just so.
I don't want to get married at all.
Just so...
Stop laughing.
You're shaking the bed.
You're so much like me, just another giggler.
Well, is he very much in love?
What do you think?
Did someone love you as much?
Besides, he's very nice.
Only not quite to my liking.
He's so narrow, like the grandfather clock in the dining-room.
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.
- Narrow, gray, light-colored...
- What nonsense you talk!
Don't you really understand?
Nikolenka would understand.
Bezukhov, for instance, is blue.
Navy blue and red.
And he's quadrangular.
- You're flirting with him, too.
- No, he's a Freemason.
He's a darling, navy blue and red.
How can I explain it to you?
Countess, are you asleep?
No one can understand all that I have in me.
Sonya? No, how could she?
She's too virtuous.
Even mother can't understand me.
It’s amazing how clever I am and...
She is so charming. She's got everything.
Extraordinarily intelligent, pretty, graceful.
She swims, rides beautifully, and her voice!
She's got a marvelous voice!
On December 31, on the eve of the new year 1810, a Catherine court dignitary was giving a grand ball.
The Czar and the diplomatic corps were expected to attend.
The Rostovs were invited, too, and Natasha was preparing for the first great ball of her life.
Sonya! That bow isn't right.
Come here, will you?
- Aren't you ready? It’s nearly 10.
- Coming!
- Are you ready, Mama?
- I only have my cap to pin on.
- Don't do it without me!
- But it's ten o'clock already!
Mavrusha, darling, hurry!
- Aren't you ever going to be ready?
- In a minute. Don't come in, Papa!
Can it be that no one will ask me to dance?
That no one will notice me?
No, it can't be!
They have got to know how I long to dance, how wonderfully I dance, and how glad they'll be to dance with me.
This is indeed interesting...
You always dance, don't you? I have a protégée here, the Rostov girl.
- Will you ask her to dance?
- Where is she?
Excuse me, I’d be happy to go on with our talk some other time.
But at a ball one should dance.
I want you to meet my daughter.
I have the pleasure of her acquaintance, if the Countess remembers me.
Would you do me the honor for a waltz?
If she goes to her cousin first, then to another lady, it will mean she will be my wife.
Isn't this marvelous?
Yes, it is. I’m very glad.
Oh, that's you. I’ve been working.
My dear, I have never experienced anything like that.
I’m in love, my friend.
- Well?
- Mama, don't ask me anything now.
- With Natasha Rostova?
- Yes. Who else?
This feeling is too strong for me.
I wasn't really living until now.
Only now I feel alive, but I can't live without her.
How could she ever love me?
I’ve never felt like this before!
But I feel scared when I’m with him.
Does that mean it's the real thing?
- Why don't you say something?
- Me? I’ve been telling you...
- Mama, are you asleep?
- No, my darling, I’m frightened.
I know I won't sleep anyway.
I never felt like this before!
That girl is such a treasure...
She's such a rare girl.
I’m asking you, don't try to rationalize, have no doubts, marry her, and I’m sure that there will never be a happier man.
- But how about her?
- She loves you.
- Nonsense, Pierre.
- Yes, I know it.
- I must talk to someone about it.
- Go on, I’d be glad to.
It had to happen that he came to
St. Petersburg when we were here.
And we had to meet at that ball.
It was Fate, I’m sure.
Yes, it must have been that.
For me now, the world is divided into two.
She is one part where you find happiness, hope and light.
The other part is all where she isn't, and that's all gloom.
Gloom and darkness.
Yes, I know what you mean.
Can a man help preferring light to gloom? I’m so happy.
- I know you're glad for my sake.
- Yes, yes.
Mama, darling, how I love you!
How happy I am!
Three weeks went by.
Not once did Prince Bolkonsky call on the Rostovs.
Natasha, darling, perhaps he's ill. After all, he was wounded at Austerlitz.
Please, don't, Mama!
I don't want to think about him.
He just started visiting us and then stopped.
And I don't feel like getting married. I’m afraid of the man.
I mean what I’m saying.
Why think that much about it?
Things are fine as they are.
Yes, that's me! And I don't need anyone.
What a charming creature that Natasha is!
She's pretty, has a nice voice, she is young, she doesn't bother anyone.
Just leave her alone!
Mama, Bolkonsky is here!
Mama, it's awful!
I don't want to be tortured!
Who's here? Why?
Oh please, Natasha!..
It’s such a long time since we have had the pleasure...
I haven't been to visit you because I had to see my father.
There was something very important
I had to talk to him about.
I would like to speak to you,
Countess.
Go, Natasha, I will call you.
Lord, have pity on me.
Lord, please help me.
Well, Mama?
Go to him.
He's asking for your hand.
Can it be that this stranger has become everything to me now?
Now he's dearer to me than anything else in the world.
Since the very first minute I saw you I have loved you.
Please say that I can hope.
Why ask?
Why doubt what it's impossible not to know?
Why talk when you can't express with words what you feel?
- Do you love me?
- Oh yes, yes...
- What is it? Is something wrong?
- I feel so happy.
Now, Prince Andrei no longer felt the same love for her as before.
Something within him had changed.
There was none of the former poetic charm of attraction, only a kind of pity for her feminine and childish weakness, a sort of terror before her devotion and trustfulness.
Although this new feeling was not as poetic as the old one, it was stronger and more serious.
Did your mother tell you that we cannot be married for a year?
Is it possible that it's me?..
Is it possible that from now on
I’m to be the wife, the equal of this stranger, who is so intelligent and charming, whom even my father looks up to?
Can it be true that life is no longer a game, that now I’m responsible for everything I do and say?
But what was it he asked me?
You are so young, and I’ve already been through such a great deal.
It’s for you that I’m afraid.
You don't know yourself yet.
Difficult as it is for me to wait an entire year, delaying my happiness, it will give you some time to test yourself.
I’m asking you to make me happy in a year.
But till then you are free.
Our engagement will remain secret.
And should you find that you do not love me...
Why do you say that?
From the first day you came to
Otradnoye, I have loved you.
In one year you will learn to know yourself.
A whole year?
Why wait a year?
Can't anything be done?
It’s frightening!
I’ll die waiting a year!
Why, it's so awful!
No! I’ll do anything.
I feel so happy!
There was no ceremony and their betrothal was not announced to anyone.
Don't go.
I beg you, Natalie,
God knows what may happen.
Perhaps you will stop loving me...
I know I shouldn't talk about that.
But whatever may happen to you when I’m not here...
Don't go...
Whatever may happen, go to Pierre for help.
He's the most absent-minded man, but he has a heart of gold.
Don't go...
How indignant Pierre would have been seven years before, when he'd returned from his sojourn abroad, if someone had told him that there would be no need for him to seek or plan anything, that his path had long ago been traced and predetermined for him.
Sometimes he consoled himself that the life he led was a temporary thing.
But then he would be shocked by another thought: how many other men had temporarily slipped into this sort of life, just as he had, with all their teeth and all their hair, only to leave it without a single tooth and without a single hair.
Why? What for?
What was going on in the world?
Now and then Pierre recalled what he had been told of soldiers under fire in ambuscade when they have nothing to do, how they try hard to find occupation so as to bear their danger more easily.
And Pierre pictured all men as such soldiers trying to find a refuge from life, some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women, some in games, some in horses, some in politics, some in sport, some in wine, some in the government service.
Nothing is trivial, nothing is important. Only one thing matters: to escape from her as best I can!
Only not to see her, that dreadful her.
Under the influence of wine he would say to himself:
"I’ll get it straightened out.
I have a solution already.
But I’ll think it over later on!”
The trouble was this “later on” never came.
Good morning, Uncle!
All’s well and quick march!
I knew you couldn't resist it.
You had better attack at once, for my Girchik reported that the Ilaghins are out with their hounds at Korniki.
They'll snatch the litter right under your noses.
That's where I’m going.
Shall we join the packs?
Good morning, Uncle!
See? We're going too!
Good morning to you. Be careful you don't trample the hounds.
We won't get in anyone's way.
We'll stay in our places.
A good thing too, little Countess, only don't fall off your horse, since there's nothing for a horse to hold on to.
Have you seen Natalya Ilyinichna?
Where is she?
She and Pyotr Ilyich are standing behind the high grass at Zharov.
A lady, but she has a great love for the chase.
And you wonder at her riding, eh?
- It wouldn't be amiss for a man.
- Yes! So daring, so smart!
You old hag, don't scare the game off, or old Danila'll curse you...
I know a thing or two myself!
They're on the track of the litter.
In the Lyadovsky uplands.
Stand still!
There!
He slipped by you! Some hunters!
Dear Lord, what would it cost You to do this for me?
I know it's a sin to ask You such a thing.
But please, let the wolf come out my way!
Just once in my life let me get a hermit wolf, that's all I want!
Keep going or go back?
Keep going!
What a magnificent wolf!
- A real hermit wolf, eh?
- The meanest one, Your Excellency.
As mean as you are, Danila.
That's my little Countess, all’s well, quick march!
I never saw an amazon like her!
Dawn to sundown, riding sidesaddle, and she's as fresh as a daisy!
Have a taste of this, little Countess.
Come on, Petya, wake up!
Taste some of this, it's delicious!
This is how I’m finishing my days.
When you die, there's nothing left at all. All’s well, quick march.
So why complain...
Open the door! Why have you shut it?
That's my coachman.
I’ve bought him a good balalaika.
How nice! It’s really good.
What do you mean, good?
It’s simply enchanting!
Please, go on! Play some more.
You enjoy it, little Countess?
He plays very well, doesn't he?
That's not the way to do it.
You should hear trills there, all’s well, quick march!
Can you play, Uncle?
Anisya, will you see if the strings are all right on the guitar?
I haven't touched it for a long time, all’s well, quick march!
Beautiful, Uncle! Go on! More!
Please, dear Uncle!
Now then, my dear niece...
Where, when, how had this little
Countess, reared in silk and velvet by a French governess, ever managed to absorb, with only the air she breathed, this manner that was so typically
Russian?
And yet the spirit and gestures were precisely and inimitably Russian, which her uncle expected to find in her.
How did she manage to grasp everything that was in Anisya, in Anisya's father, in her mother, in every Russian man or woman?
Well done, my little Countess!
That's my niece!
All you need now is to pick out a worthy young man for a husband!
He's already picked out.
Yes, and a very good one!
What did Nikolai's smile mean when he said, “he's already picked out”?
He acts as if he thought that my
Bolkonsky wouldn't understand, wouldn't approve of this wonderful time we're having.
But he would understand.
Where is he now?
But I mustn't think about him.
Night has laid out a blanket
Of the newly-fallen snow.
Swept it over every pathway
In the field of predawn glow.
It’s not sorrow that's eating
A good fellow, it's woe.
A good fellow is grieving...
- What are you thinking about?
- Me? Wait.
I was thinking that here we're driving thinking we're going home.
But actually, we're going Heaven knows where and finally we'd arrive and find we weren't at Otradnoye, but that we were in a fairy land.
And then I thought...
No, that was all.
-You were certainly thinking of him.
- No.
And also I was thinking how beautiful Anisya was.
I know that I shall never be as happy as I am now.
Nonsense, gibberish, folly.
What a treasure my Natasha is!
I have no other friend like her and I’ll never have.
Why does she have to marry? We could have gone like this forever.
What a treasure my Nikolai is.
Oh, if he'd only come back sooner.
I’m afraid we'll never get married.
Worst of all, I’m getting older...
I shall no longer be what I am now.
But what if he comes today?
Perhaps he came yesterday, and I’ve forgotten it?
What am I to do with them?
Oh yes, Nikita, will you please go and...
Where am I to send him?
Yes, will you please go to the yard and bring me a rooster?
Nastasya Ivanovna, what shall I give birth to?
You? Fleas.
Dragon-flies, grasshoppers.
Oh, my God, the same old thing.
Where am I to go?
What am I to do with myself?
The Island of Mad-a-gas-car.
Mad-a-gas-car. Madagascar.
Do you feel sometimes that nothing is going to happen to you anymore, that everything good had already happened, and you feel not so much bored, as sad?
Oh yes, very often!
I remember moments, when everybody around is cheerful, it suddenly strikes me that I’m sick of it all, and all must die.
I didn't go to a squadron party once, and there the music was playing, and I felt all at once so dreary.
I know it. I know it.
Even when I was quite little,
I used to have that feeling.
Do you remember, I was punished once for eating some plums, and you were all dancing, and I sat in the study sobbing?
I shall never forget it.
I felt so miserable and sorry for everyone.
And what's most important,
I wasn't to blame.
I remember that I came to you later and I longed to comfort you.
We used to be so funny.
I had a dummy toy then, and I wanted to give it to you.
- Do you remember it, Sonya?
- Yes, I do remember something.
How strange it is, as though it were a dream. I like that.
And do you remember how Papa, in his blue fur coat, fired a gun off on the porch?
Do you remember what fun it was?..
- They've brought a rooster, Miss.
- Tell them to take it back.
I think that when one goes on remembering and remembering, one remembers till one recalls what happened before one was in this world.
That's metempsychosis.
The Egyptians used to believe that our souls had been in animals, and would go into animals again.
I don't believe we were once in animals, but I know for certain that we were once angels somewhere, and we have been here, and that's why we remember everything.
If we had been angels, why should we have fallen lower?
Not lower.
Who told you we were lower?
This is how I know
I have existed before.
The soul is immortal, you know.
If I’m to live forever, that means
I have lived for all eternity.
But it's hard for us to conceive of eternity.
Why is it hard?
There's today, there will be tomorrow, and there will be forever, and yesterday has been, and the day before.
The mummers are here!
- Natasha!
- Did you see? Did you see him?
Yes.
- Wait, I... saw him.
- Standing or lying down?
At first there wasn't anything. Then suddenly, I saw him lying down.
- Lying down? Could he be ill?
- No. His face was cheerful.
What happened then, Sonya?
I couldn't make it out.
I saw something blue and red.
When is he going to come back?
When shall I see him again?
I’m so afraid for him, and for myself, and about everything else...
Prince Andrei wants his year reduced by three months.
So write him and tell him to wait till I’m dead. It won't take long.
Go ahead, marry, dear son.
What a fine alliance!
Smart people, eh? And rich, eh?
And what a stepmother he's going to give poor Nikolushka!
Let him marry tomorrow if he wants! And I’ll marry our governess!
He mustn't be without a stepmother, either!
But I’m not going to put up with any more women in my house!
Would you like to live with him, too? Bon voyage and good riddance!
Put the Count's things over here.
The young ladies' - on the left.
You've grown plumper and prettier.
Phoo! How cold you are!
Maria Dmitrievna, my Countess has gotten ill. Our house isn't heated.
I took an opportunity of your invitation, and here we are.
High time you did.
I’m so glad you could come.
The old Bolkonsky's in Moscow.
His son is also expected any day.
You really should make his acquaintance.
His highness cannot see you, but her highness, the Princess, asks you to come up.
You see, my dear Princess, I’ve brought you my little songstress.
I’m so happy that you can get to know each other.
I have long wanted to do so, Count.
I’m very glad.
I’m sorry to hear that the Prince is unwell.
If you'll permit, Princess,
I’d like to leave my Natasha in your hands for a quarter of an hour.
I would like to drop in on Anna Semyonovna.
Then I’ll come back and pick her up.
Please spend the longest time possible at your friend's.
My dear Natalie, I’m so delighted to see that my brother has found happiness at last.
I think, Princess, that it's not opportune to talk about that now.
Ah, Mademoiselle!
Countess Rostova, if I am not mistaken?
I beg your pardon.
God is my witness, I didn't know that you've honored us with a visit.
It was to my daughter that I came in this costume.
Please excuse me.
So help me God, I didn't know.
I beg you to excuse me.
After all, what do his father and sister matter to me?
He's the one I love and he alone.
No, I’d better not think of him.
I’d better forget him for now.
Look what a cap Anna Mikhailovna has on.
That's the Karaghins with Julie and
Boris. One can see they're engaged.
Drubetskoy has made a proposal.
I heard so today.
How long have you been in town,
Countess?
I have some business here, too, and I’ve brought my girls with me.
They say, Semyonova's acting is superb.
Here he is, Kuraghin!
I can't call on you. Does it mean
I’ll never see you again?
How madly I’m in love with you!
Never to see you again?
Natalie!
Just one word! For the love of God!
One word!
Mademoiselle, a man asked me to give you this.
Since last evening, my fate is sealed:
To be loved by you or to die.
I have no other choice.
Forget all this. There's time yet.
Stop talking nonsense.
If you only knew what this means to me.
I’m being serious.
What you're planning is no joke.
Stop teasing me!
Go to the devil!
I’ve helped you plan this, but you must be told the truth.
This affair is dangerous, and when you think of it, it's stupid.
All right, you'll take the girl away, but they won't let it go at that.
They're going to find out you're married. They'll take you to court!
Rubbish! Haven't I explained everything to you?
If this marriage is invalid,
I won't have to answer for anything.
And if it's valid, in a foreign country no one will know a thing.
So I don't want to hear about it any more.
- You'll get your head in a noose.
- You go to the devil!
You don't understand what I’m going through. Just feel it beating.
What a lovely foot she has! And the look in her eye! A pure goddess!
-When your money's gone, what then?
- What then?..
How am I to know what then?..
Don't talk nonsense.
Sonya, I can't keep it from you any longer.
We're in love.
He's written to me, Sonya...
And Bolkonsky?
You can't imagine how happy I am!
You mean you're breaking up with Prince Andrei?
You don't understand anything.
Stop this nonsense, listen to me.
I’m not going to let you do it.
I will tell.
If you tell, then you're my enemy!
You want to ruin my life.
You can't meddle in such affairs.
I confided in you...
Why doesn't he come right out and ask for your hand?
After all, Prince Andrei has given you complete freedom.
You mustn't doubt him, Sonya, don't you understand?
- What if he's not an honorable man?
- I can't live without him!
I don't understand you!
Think of your father, of Nikolai!
I don't need anyone!
I don't love anybody except him!
I don't want to quarrel. Please go!
Don't you see that I’m suffering?
Well, lads, friends of my youth, we have had jolly sprees together!
Now, when shall we meet again?
I’m going abroad. Farewell!
- Let's get going!
- And where's the sable coat?
Ignatka! Go upstairs and ask for a sable coat!
She'll come out nearly dead with fright, wearing whatever she had on.
If you don't act fast, she'll get cold and want to go back.
Then you wrap the coat around her and carry her over to the sleigh.
You idiot! I said sable, didn't l?
Come on, take it. I won't miss it.
I shall demonstrate.
That's the way. See?
Giddyap!
She will be out directly.
- Will you come to the mistress?
- What mistress?
My orders are to bring you in.
Kuraghin! We've been betrayed!
Maria Dmitrievna, let me in to see her, for God's sake!
Shameless girl! Wretched little hussy!
A fine thing! Arranging meetings with lovers under my roof.
Enough of those crocodile tears.
Listen to me when I speak to you.
You've disgraced yourself, like a common girl of the streets.
I don't know what I’d have done if
I didn't feel sorry for your father.
A lucky thing for that scoundrel that he escaped, but he'll be found.
Will you listen to what I’m saying?
Let me alone. I don't care.
I’m going to die!
Natasha!
I’m doing this for your own good.
Now lie still, I won't touch you.
What am I going to tell your father when he comes back tomorrow?
-What if he and your fiance find out?
- I have no fiance. I’ve broken up.
Makes no difference. He'll find out.
Do you think he'll keep quiet?
He might even challenge that scoundrel to a duel. What then?
Will you leave me alone?
Why did you have to meddle?
Who asked you to do that?
Just what did you expect?
Suppose he had kidnapped you?
Do you think you'd get away with it?
He's a scoundrel, that's what he is!
He's better than any of you!
Why did you have to interfere?
Oh, merciful God, why?
Sonya, why?
Will you get out?
Everyone hates me, despises me!
You are worse than a cad. You're a scoundrel!
Why am I denying myself the pleasure of smashing your head?
- Had you promised to marry her?
- I... I didn't think.
Well, I couldn't make any promises because I’m married already.
Have you any letters from her?
I won't do anything to you, don't be afraid.
I’ve got the letters. Now you will have to leave Moscow by morning.
And one other thing. You'll never breathe a word about what happened.
I know I can't prevent you from doing so, but if there remains in you a scrap of human conscience...
If you must, go to women like my wife for your diversion.
They know what you want, and so there you're within your rights.
They're as well armed as you with the same experience of debauchery.
But deceiving a girl whom you've vowed to marry... kidnapping her...
Have you never been told that it's just as cowardly and infamous as killing an old man or a child?
I wouldn't know and I really don't care to know.
But you used certain words, like cowardly and so on, that I cannot condone as a man of honor.
Although there are no witnesses, still I’m not going...
You want satisfaction?
You might at least take back your insults, if you want me to comply with your wishes.
I take back my words and ask you to forgive me.
And should you need any money for your journey...
What a breed you are! Mean, sordid, heartless!
Her letters and her portrait. Would you return them to the Countess?
She is very ill.
So she is still here?
And Prince Kuraghin?
He left long ago.
She almost died.
I’m very sorry to hear of her illness.
I take it, Monsieur Kuraghin did not honor her with his hand?
He couldn't marry because he was already married.
And where might your brother-in-law be now, if I may ask?
He left for St. Petersburg...
Actually I’ve no idea where he is.
You may tell Countess Rostova she's always been and remains free, and that I wish her every happiness.
Do you remember that discussion we had in St. Petersburg...
Yes, I told you that one should forgive a fallen woman.
But I never said I would be able to.
I can't forgive.
But can this be compared?
Once more to ask for her hand, to be magnanimous?
I am not up to following the same path as that gentleman.
If you want to be my friend, don't talk to me again about that... about all this.
Well, goodbye.
Pyotr Kirillovich,
Prince Bolkonsky is your friend.
He once told me
I could come to you for help.
Now the Prince is here...
Could you tell him to... to please forgive me?
- Yes, I will tell him, but...
- I know everything's finished.
What torments me is that I have hurt him so.
Can you tell him that I beg him to forgive me for everything.
Yes, I’ll tell him. I will do as you ask.
Only I’d like to know one thing...
I would like to know whether you loved...
Did you love that evil man?
You mustn't call him evil.
I don't know anymore.
Then we won't speak of it again, my dear.
I will tell him everything, but you must think of me as your friend.
If you ever need help, if you feel like confiding in someone, not right now, but when you can see in yourself more clearly, remember I’m your friend.
If there's anything I can do,
I would be happy...
Please don't be so kind.
I don't deserve it!
Don't say that! Your whole life still lies ahead of you.
No! For me, everything's finished.
Everything is finished?
If I were somebody else, somebody who was good-looking, intelligent and the best of men, and if I were free,
I would be right now at your feet asking for your hand and your love.
It seemed to him that this dazzling comet was the perfect symbol of what he felt in his compassionate soul which brimmed with the blossom of a new life.
On June 12, the armies of Western
Europe crossed the Russian border, and the war began, an event completely opposed to human reason and human nature.
End of Part Two
subrip：xunbao http://www.waf.com.cn
He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.
Did you know him well?
I knew him.
Well, nil nisi bonum.
But did he really deserve...
...a place in here?
Lord Allenby, could you give a few words about Lawrence?
What, more words?
The revolt in the desert...
...played a decisive part in the Middle Eastern campaign.
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.
No, no. I didn't know him well, you know.
Mr. Bentley, you know as much about Lawrence as anybody.
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.
And to make him known to the world.
He was a poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior.
Thank you.
He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.
You, sir. Who are you?
My name is Jackson Bentley.
I overheard your last remark and take the gravest exception.
- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?
No, I can't claim to have known him.
I had the honour to shake his hand in Damascus.
Knew him? I never knew him.
He had some minor function on my staff in Cairo.
Michael George Hartley...
...this is a nasty, dark little room.
That's right.
We are not happy in it.
I am. It's better than a nasty, dark little trench.
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.
Here is William Potter with my newspaper.
- Here you are, tosh.
- Thanks.
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?
- Is it there?
- Of course.
Headlines.
But I bet it isn't mentioned in the Times.
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."
I bet that no one in this headquarters even knows it happened.
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.
Michael George Hartley, you're a philosopher.
And you're balmy!
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.
What's the trick, then?
The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.
By the way, if Captain Gibbon should enquire for me...
...tell him I've gone for a chat with the general.
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.
Lawrence.
Yes?
You're supposed to be...
Do you usually wear your cap in the mess?
Always.
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.
I'm going for a powwow with the general.
I'm not asking as your superior, but as the secretary of this mess.
We don't want chaps in here who should be on duty.
Where are you going?
I must say, Lawrence!
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.
Sorry.
It's an intrigue, Dryden.
I do not propose to let an overweening, crass lieutenant...
...thumb his nose at his commander and get away with it.
It doesn't sound as though he'd be any great loss, sir.
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.
There is, indeed.
He's of no use here in Cairo.
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.
Knows the books, you mean.
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.
If Brighton thinks we should send some arms, we will.
Well, what more do you want?
That there would be no question of Lieutenant Lawrence...
...giving military advice.
By God, I should hope not.
It's just that the Arab Bureau would like its own man on the spot to...
To what?
To make our own appraisal of the situation.
I'll tell you, it's my considered opinion and that of my staff...
...that time spent on the Bedouin will be time wasted.
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.
They did attack Medina.
And the Turks made mincemeat of them.
We don't know that.
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.
In my opinion, this whole theatre of operations is a sideshow.
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.
Not here, but on the Western front in the trenches.
Your Bedouin Army, or whatever it calls itself...
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.
Big things have small beginnings, sir.
Does the Arab Bureau want a big thing in Arabia?
Does the bureau think they'll sit down under us when this war is over?
The bureau thinks the job of the moment, sir, is to win the war.
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.
Good morning, sir.
Salute.
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.
- It's my manner.
- Your what?
My manner. It looks insubordinate, but it isn't.
I can't make out whether you're bad-mannered or just half-witted.
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.
The Arab Bureau thinks you would be of use to them in Arabia.
Why, I can't imagine.
You can't perform your present duties properly.
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make a great state from a little city."
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.
- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.
It says so in your dossier.
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.
But I suppose I could be wrong.
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.
Who knows? It might even make a man of him. Come in!
Yes, what is it?
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.
There doesn't seem to be any artillery.
But there must be artillery!
Sir, this is something of an expedition.
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide, find the Arabs and then get back.
He can't do that in six weeks.
- Two months, then.
- Three.
All right, three. Now, will you let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?
Thank you, sir.
I'd like to say, sir, that I am grateful for this.
Shut up and get out.
Sir?
How can I fight a bloody war without bloody artillery?
- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?
Find Prince Feisal.
Good. And when I've found him?
Find out what kind of a man he is.
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.
That is Colonel Brighton's business, not yours.
I mean, his intentions in Arabia altogether.
That's new.
Where are they now?
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.
They're Hashemite Bedouins.
They can cross 60 miles of desert in a day.
Thanks. This is going to be fun.
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature get fun in the desert:
Bedouins and gods, and you're neither. Take it from me.
For ordinary men, it's a burning fiery furnace.
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.
It is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun.
Here you may drink.
One cup.
You do not drink?
No.
I'll drink when you do.
I am Bedu.
Truly, now, you are a British officer?
Yes.
From Cairo?
Yes.
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.
And before?
From Britain?
Yes.
Truly?
From Oxfordshire.
Is that a desert country?
No. A fat country. Fat people.
You are not fat?
No.
I'm different.
Here...
...take it.
First I take you to Lord Feisal, then you give it to me.
Take it now.
Bedu food.
Good.
More?
- Bedu.
- Where?
From here to Lord Feisal's camp is Harith country.
Yes, I know.
- I am not Harith.
- No.
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.
When you are ready to go...
...hit her on the shoulder and say, "Hut-hut-hut."
Today will be difficult, but tomorrow, good riding.
I think we reach Masturah Well tomorrow. Yes.
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.
Now!
Good?
It's all right.
This is a Harith well.
The Harith are a dirty people.
Turks?
Bedu.
Who is he?
He is dead.
Yes.
Why?
This is my well.
I have drunk from it.
You are welcome.
He was my friend.
- That?
- Yes, that.
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.
His?
Mine.
Then I will use it.
Your friend...
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.
I know.
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.
I have heard of you.
So...
...what was a Hazimi doing here?
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.
- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.
I can both read and write.
My Lord Feisal already has an Englishman.
What is your name?
My name is for my friends.
None of my friends is a murderer.
You are angry, English.
He was nothing.
The well is everything.
The Hazimi may not drink at our wells.
He knew that.
Salaam.
Sherif Ali.
So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe...
...so long will they be a little people...
...a silly people.
Greedy, barbarous and cruel, as you are.
Come.
I will take you to Feisal.
I do not want your company, sherif.
Wadi Safra is another day from here.
You will not find it, and you will die.
I will find it with this.
Good army compass.
How if I take it?
Then you would be a thief.
Have you no fear, English?
My fear is my concern.
Truly.
God be with you, English.
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air
You can hear the girls declare
He must be a millionaire
I'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo
Hey, you!
- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.
How did he know?
Not much happens within 50 miles of Feisal that he doesn't know.
I'll give him that. No escort?
My guide was killed at the Masturah Well.
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.
Bloody savages.
- This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?
Lawrence. I've been seconded to the Arab Bureau.
What are you to do for the Arab Bureau?
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.
Their morale, if they ever had any, which I doubt...
...the Turks knocked out of them in front of Medina, with howitzers.
They're fading away by dozens every night.
What I want to say is this:
Wherever you are and whoever you are with...
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.
When we get into that camp, you're to keep your mouth shut.
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.
You'll make your appreciation and get back to...
Oh, my God.
Not again.
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."
They simply will not understand what modern weapons do!
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.
Fire back at them.
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.
You were right and I was wrong.
We must take some thought for the wounded.
- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- Lf they can get to Yenbo.
They can hardly come with us.
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant?
Lawrence.
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...
...my people are unused to explosives and machines.
First the guns, and now this.
Cigarette?
I'm sorry.
Cigarette, Your Excellency?
Umph off.
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?
Hold it, Jenkins!
Jenkins!
Lawrence?
You have no servant.
- I don't need a servant.
- No?
We can do everything. Light fires, cook food, wash clothes.
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may be easy to you.
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may be easy to you.
God knoweth that there be some among you sick...
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.
Others do battle in His cause.
Recite, therefore, as much as may be easy.
And observe the prayers.
This will be best and richest in the recompense.
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful...
Greetings, Ali.
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.
Yes, my lord.
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."
"By the noonday brightness...
...and by the night when it darkeneth...
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...
...neither hath He been displeased.
And surely the future shall be better for thee than the past."
"And in the end shall your Lord be bounteous to thee...
...and thou be satisfied."
So?
Yes, colonel.
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.
Well, you're not doing much good here, sir.
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we can't supply you here.
You could supply us through Aqaba!
Aqaba!
If you can get ahold of Aqaba, we can supply you.
- But you can't!
- You could.
You mean, the navy?
The Turks have 12-inch guns at Aqaba, sir.
Can you imagine what that means?
Yes, I can imagine.
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.
The one essential sector of this front is and must be the canal.
You can see that, sir, surely.
I see that the canal is an essential British interest.
It is of little consequence to us.
I must ask you not to speak like that.
British and Arab interests are one and the same.
Possibly.
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.
Fall back on Yenbo and we will give you equipment.
Give you arms, advice, training, everything.
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.
No. Guns. Artillery.
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.
Yes, give us guns and keep the training.
Your men need training far more than guns, sir.
English will teach
Bedu to fight?
We will teach them, Sherif Ali, to fight a modern mechanized army.
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?
I think it is far from Damascus.
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?
Yes, my lord.
It is beautiful, is it not?
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus, but discipline will.
Look, Great Britain is a small country, much smaller than yours.
Small population compared with some.
It's small, but it's great. And why?
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.
Because it has a navy, because of this...
...the English go where they please...
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!
Lawrence is not your military adviser.
But I would like to hear his opinion.
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.
My lord, I think...
I think your book is right.
The desert is an ocean in which no oar is dipped.
On this ocean, the Bedu go where they please...
...and strike where they please.
This is the way the Bedu has always fought.
You're famed through the world for fighting this way.
And this is the way you should fight now.
I don't know.
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising becomes one unit in the British army.
- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.
No, colonel.
He is a young man, and young men are passionate.
They must say their say.
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.
You tread heavily...
...but you speak the truth.
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...
...it is late.
Colonel Brighton means to put my men...
...under European officers, does he not?
In effect, my lord, yes.
And I must do it...
...because the Turks have
European guns.
But I fear to do it...
...upon my soul I do.
The English have a great hunger for desolate places.
I fear they hunger for Arabia.
Then you must deny it to them.
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?
To England and to other things.
To England and Arabia both?
And is that possible?
I think you are another of these desert-Ioving English.
Doughty, Stanhope...
...Gordon of Khartoum.
No Arab loves the desert.
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.
And no man needs nothing.
Or is it that you think we are something you can play with...
...because we are a little people, a silly people...
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?
Or do you know, lieutenant, in the Arab city of Cordoba...
...were two miles of lighting in the streets...
...when London was a village.
Yes, you were great.
Nine centuries ago.
Time to be great again, my lord.
Which is why my father made this war upon the Turks.
My father, Mr. Lawrence, not the English.
But my father is old...
...and I...
...I long for the vanished gardens of Cordoba.
However, before the gardens must come the fighting.
To be great again, it seems that we need the English...
...or...
Or?
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.
We need a miracle.
Aqaba.
Aqaba.
From the land.
You are mad.
To come to Aqaba by land we should have to cross the Nefud Desert.
That's right.
The Nefud cannot be crossed.
I'll cross it if you will.
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.
Fifty men?
Fifty? Against Aqaba?
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...
...they would be 50 men other men might join.
The Howeitat are there, I hear.
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.
- Good fighters, though.
- Good...
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.
They face the sea, Sherif Ali, and cannot be turned around.
From the landward side, there are no guns at Aqaba.
With good reason. It cannot be approached from the landward side.
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.
Aqaba's over there.
It's only a matter of going.
You are mad.
And where are you going, lieutenant?
With 50 of my men.
To work your miracle.
Blasphemy is a bad beginning for such a journey.
- Who told you?
- Ali did.
Why not you?
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?
Yes, I must.
But I will spare these to you.
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance, my lord.
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.
No.
Since you do know...
...we can claim to arrive in the name of Feisal of Mecca.
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence, you may claim it.
But in whose name do you ride?
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.
They were here. I caught them.
Why are you here? Boy!
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.
You have been tracking us.
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.
Our camel strayed. We followed her.
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.
Don't do that.
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.
Be warned. They are not suitable.
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.
One shilling, every week?
That is fair.
- Each?
- No.
- That is too much.
- All right.
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.
There is the railway.
And that is the desert.
From here until the other side, no water but what we carry.
For the camels, no water at all.
If the camels die...
...we die.
And in 20 days they will start to die.
There's no time to waste, then, is there?
I was thinking.
You were drifting.
Yes. It will not happen again.
Be warned, you were drifting.
It will not happen again.
That water is wasted.
From now on, we must travel by night...
...and rest while it is too hot to travel.
A few hours each day.
Why don't we start now?
No. We will rest now.
Three hours.
Fine.
I'll wake you.
Do we rest here?
There is no rest now short of water.
The other side of that.
And how much of that is there?
I'm not sure.
But however much, it must be crossed before tomorrow's sun gets up.
This is the sun's anvil.
Have we done it?
No, but we're off the anvil.
Thank God for that anyway.
Yes, thank Him.
Lawrence, I do not think you know how you have tempted Him.
I know.
We've done it.
God willing.
When do we reach the wells?
God willing, midday.
- Then we've done it.
- Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.
Gasim's.
What's happened to him?
God knows.
Why don't you stop?
For what? He will be dead by midday.
We must go back.
What for, to die with Gasim?
In one hour comes the sun.
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!
I can.
Take the boys.
If you go back, you kill yourself, is all.
Gasim you have killed already.
Get out of my way.
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.
Nothing is written!
Go back, then!
What did you bring us here for with your blasphemous conceit?
English blasphemer!
Aqaba?
Was it Aqaba?
You will not be at Aqaba, English!
Go back, blasphemer...
...but you will not be at Aqaba.
I shall be at Aqaba.
That is written.
In here.
English!
English!
Lawrence! Daud!
Nothing is written.
Al Lawrence.
Farraj.
Wash.
Al Lawrence.
Truly, for some men nothing is written unless they write it.
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.
- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.
Then when he dies, you too will be a lord.
No.
You have an elder brother.
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.
He didn't marry my mother.
I see.
I'm sorry.
It seems to me that you are free to choose your own name, then.
Yes, I suppose I am.
Al Lawrence is best.
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.
They are the robes of a sherif of the Beni Wejh.
Very fine.
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.
He for whom nothing is written may write himself a clan.
They are good for riding. Try.
What are you doing, Englishman?
As you see.
Are you alone?
Almost.
Are you with those dogs drinking at my well?
Yours?
I am Auda Abu Tayi.
I've heard of another man of that name.
Other? What other?
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to summon help to look after his wells.
He must be a great hero.
He is.
He wouldn't refuse water to men coming out of Nefud Desert.
Now, would he not?
No, that must be some other man.
Here is my help.
Son, what fashion is this?
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?
A Beni Wejh sherif.
And is he Harith?
No, Father, English.
Son...
...they are stealing our water.
Tell them we are coming.
Tell them.
- Empty that!
- Do not!
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.
Harith.
Ali.
Does your father still steal?
No.
Does Auda take me for one of his own bastards?
No. There is no resemblance.
Alas, you resemble your father.
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.
I knew your father well.
Did you know your own?
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?
Why, then you have a blood feud with the Howeitat.
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...
...nor the sultan himself desire that.
Call off your men.
This honours the unworthy.
I've only just begun to teach him.
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?
Be not clever with me, English.
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.
Is he your tongue?
We do desire it.
Then it is given, if you will take it.
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.
But...
...dine with me.
Dine with Auda, English.
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.
It is my pleasure that you dine with me in Wadi Rumm!
This thing you work against Aqaba...
...what profit do you hope from it?
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.
The Harith do not work for profit.
Well, if it is in a man to be a servant, Sherif Ali...
...he could find worse masters than Feisal.
But I...
I cannot serve.
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.
Yes, it is my pleasure.
We do not work this thing for Feisal.
No?
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.
The Arabs?
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.
I have even heard of the Harith.
But the Arabs?
What tribe is that?
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.
Well, they are nothing to me.
My tribe is the Howeitat.
Who work only for profit.
Who work at Auda's pleasure.
And Auda's pleasure is to serve the Turks.
Serve?
I serve?
It is the servant who takes money.
I am Auda Abu Tayi.
- Does Auda serve?
- No!
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!
I carry 23 great wounds, all got in battle.
75 men have I killed with my own hands, in battle.
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.
The Turks pay me a golden treasure, yet I am poor!
Because I am a river to my people.
Is that service?
No.
And yet now it seems Auda has grown old.
And lost his taste for fighting.
It is well you say it in my tent, thou old tulip.
Yet this is a tulip that the Turks could not buy.
Why should they wish to?
Now...
I will tell you what they pay me, and you will tell me if this is...
...a servant's wages.
They pay me, month by month...
...100 golden guineas.
150, Auda.
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.
And a long tongue between them.
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.
A trifle which they take from a great box they have.
In Aqaba.
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?
You trouble me like women.
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.
- For money?
- No.
- For Feisal?
- No!
Nor to drive away the Turks.
He will come...
...because it is his pleasure.
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.
Make God your agent!
Aqaba!
Aqaba!
God be with you.
God be with you.
God be with you.
God be with you.
Yes.
Aqaba.
Tomorrow we will go and get it.
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.
If you are right about the guns.
He killed. He dies.
This is the end of Aqaba.
One of our men murdered Auda's man.
Why?
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.
Ali!
It is an ancient wound.
I didn't come here to watch a tribal bloodbath.
It is the law, Lawrence.
The law says the man must die.
If he dies, will that content the Howeitat?
Yes.
Sherif Ali!
If none of Lord Auda's men harms any of yours...
...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.
Then I will execute the law.
I have no tribe.
And no one is offended.
Gasim.
Did you do it?
Well, Lawrence...
What ails the Englishman?
That that he killed was the man he brought out of the Nefud.
It was written, then.
Better to have left him.
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.
Besides, it was necessary.
You gave life and you took it.
The writing is still yours.
Auda Abu Tayi!
The miracle is accomplished.
Garlands for the conqueror.
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.
I'm none of those things, Ali.
- What, then?
- Don't know.
Thanks.
My God, I love this country.
What!
No gold in Aqaba!
Auda, I found it!
That's a pity.
Ali, get a message down the coast to Yenbo.
Tell Feisal to find boats, any boats...
...and bring the Arab army here to Aqaba, quickly.
And you?
I'm going to tell the generals...
...in Cairo.
Yes, cross Sinai.
Come on!
Sinai?
Yes.
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and said:
"We've taken Aqaba," the generals would laugh.
I see.
In Cairo you will put off these funny clothes.
You'll wear trousers and tell stories of our quaintness and barbarity...
...and then they will believe you.
You're an ignorant man.
Paper.
Paper!
There is no gold in Aqaba.
No gold.
No great box!
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?
For my pleasure, as you said.
But gold is honorable...
...and Lawrence promised gold.
Lawrence lied.
See, Auda.
"The Crown of England...
...promises to pay...
...5000 golden guineas...
...to Auda Abu Tayi."
Signed in His Majesty's absence...
...by...
...me.
In 10 days...
...I'll be back with the gold.
With gold, with guns, with everything.
Ten days.
You'll cross Sinai?
Why not?
Moses did.
And you will take the children?
Moses did.
Moses was a prophet...
...and beloved of God.
He said there was gold here.
He lied.
He is not perfect.
Lord, can we not rest?
I told you, no rest till they know that I have Aqaba.
Have you two slept in beds?
Farraj?
Daud?
With sheets?
Tomorrow the finest sheets in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.
I promise.
Then it shall be so, lord.
Look!
Pillar of fire.
No, lord. Dust.
My compass.
No matter.
If we ride west, we must strike the canal.
Due west.
Come on!
Lawrence!
Farraj!
Farraj, don't! Don't!
Don't!
Why do you walk?
But why, lord?
But why, lord?
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.
Lawrence, look!
It's all right, Farraj.
It's all right.
Who are you?
Who are you?
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.
You taking him in there?
Yes.
Here!
Here. You!
And where the hell do you think you're going to, Mustapha?
We are thirsty.
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.
- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.
You can't take him in there, sir.
What do you think you look like?
No, no. You must go.
No, no. Go, effendi, go!
Get out! You must get out! Get out!
We want two large glasses of lemonade.
- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.
- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.
- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.
Corporal, we'll have this one out anyway.
- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.
What's going on?
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.
Explain yourself.
We've taken Aqaba.
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.
We have.
He likes your lemonade.
You mean the Turks have gone?
No, they're still there but they've no boots.
Prisoners, sir. We took them prisoners. The entire garrison.
That's not true. We killed some.
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.
There's been a lot of killing one way or another.
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's all perfectly true.
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.
I did it.
You'd better talk to Allenby.
- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.
That's a step in the right direction.
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.
Right. You want a bed yourself, don't you?
See Allenby first, though.
Will he see me?
I think so.
Do that, then.
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.
You'd better get into some trousers too.
"Undisciplined.
Unpunctual.
Untidy.
Several languages.
Knowledge of music...
...literature.
Knowledge of...
Knowledge of..."
You're an interesting man, there's no doubt about it.
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.
- Sir.
- Sir.
Then why did you?
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.
- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.
True.
And it will be further behind your right when you go for Jerusalem.
Am I going for Jerusalem?
Yes.
Very well.
Aqaba behind my right.
It threatened EI' Arish and Gaza.
Anything else?
Yes.
Aqaba's linked with Medina.
Do you think we should shift them out of Medina now?
No. I think you should leave them there.
You acted without orders, you know.
Shouldn't officers use their initiative at all times?
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.
Yes, I know.
Already?
Yes.
I'm promoting you major.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...
...and carry on the good work.
No. Thank you, sir.
- Why not?
- Well, I, it's...
Let me see now...
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.
One was a boy.
That was...
...yesterday.
I led him into a quicksand.
The other was a man.
That was...
...before Aqaba, anyway.
I had to execute him with my pistol.
There was something about it
I didn't like.
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.
No. Something else.
What, then?
I enjoyed it.
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.
What do you mean coming dressed like that? Amateur theatricals?
Yes. Entirely.
Let me see that hat thing or whatever it is.
Fascinating gear they wear.
How would I look in this, Harry?
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.
What I'm trying to say is I don't think I'm fit for it.
Really? What do you think, Dryden?
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said it couldn't be done.
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.
I think you should recommend a decoration, sir.
I don't think it matters what his motives were.
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!
Come on, then.
You're a clever man, sir.
No, but I know a good thing when I see one.
That's fair, surely?
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.
- Bravo.
- You know better?
I fight like Clausewitz, then you fight like Saxe.
We should do very well indeed, shouldn't we?
Easy, gentlemen, please.
- Give us something to drink.
- Of course, sir.
I'm here at the invitation of Major Lawrence.
Tracy.
Shall we go outside?
So you hold bound the Turkish desert army?
Yes.
With 1000 Arabs?
With 1000 Arabs?
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.
Delivered anywhere, day or night.
It means 1000 camels.
That means 1000 packs of high explosives and 1000 crack rifles.
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.
I'll smash his railways.
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.
You are going back, then?
Yes.
Of course I'm going back.
Well, if we can see it, so can the Turk.
If he finds he's using four divisions to fend off a handful of bandits...
...he'll withdraw.
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.
If he gets out now, he'll never get back again.
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.
Arabia's for the Arabs now.
That's what I've told them anyway.
That's what they think.
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.
They've only one suspicion.
That we'll let them drive the Turks out and then move in ourselves.
I've told them that that's false, that we have no ambitions in Arabia.
Have we?
I'm not a politician, thank God.
Have we any ambition in Arabia, Dryden?
Difficult question, sir.
I want to know, sir, if I can tell them in your name...
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.
Certainly.
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.
Right.
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.
More money.
- How much more?
- 25,000 now. A lot more later.
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.
A couple of armoured cars.
Right.
Field artillery.
Right.
I'll give you every blessed thing I can...
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.
Thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen.
Congratulations!
Are you really going to give them artillery, sir?
I was wondering that, sir.
Might be difficult to get it back.
Give them artillery and you've made them independent.
Then I can't give it to them, can I?
- For you to say.
- No, it's not.
I've got orders to obey, thank God.
Not like that poor devil.
He's riding the whirlwind.
Let's hope we're not.
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?
To Prince Feisal.
- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.
You know him though?
He is my master. I am his servant.
Can you read?
Chicago Courier is my paper, but my work is syndicated in America.
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.
Now...
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?
Not altogether, sir, no.
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?
I don't know.
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.
In Mellaha now? They move fast.
They do.
But not so fast as we do, you will find.
Myself...
...I am going to Cairo.
- As you know.
- Yes.
There's work for me there of a different kind.
Yes.
I understand you've been given no artillery.
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?
It restricts us to small things.
It's intended to.
Do you know General Allenby?
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.
Slim customer. It's very good.
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.
Your Highness, we Americans were once a colonial people.
We naturally feel sympathetic to any people...
...who struggle for their freedom.
Very gratifying.
Also, my interests are the same as yours. You want your story told.
I badly want a story to tell.
Ah, now you are talking turkey, are you not?
I will give you a guide and a letter.
And before I leave here...
...which must be presently...
...I will have some facts and figures put on paper for you.
You know that we are destroying the Turkish railways.
I do, sir.
Major Lawrence is in charge of all this, is he?
My army is made up of tribes.
The tribes are led by the tribal leaders.
Your people do think very highly of Major Lawrence?
Oh, yes. And the rightly.
In this country, Mr. Bentley...
...the man who gives victory in battle is prized...
...beyond every other man.
One figure I can give you from my head...
...because it never leaves my head.
Since starting this campaign four months ago, we have lost...
...37 wounded...
...156 dead.
You remark the disproportion between our dead and wounded.
Yeah.
Four times as many.
That's because those too wounded to bring away, we ourselves kill.
We leave no wounded for the Turks.
- You mean?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.
In their eyes, we are not soldiers but rebels.
Rebels, wounded or whole, are not protected by the Geneva Code...
...and are treated harshly.
How harshly?
More harshly than I hope you can imagine.
I see.
Our own prisoners are taken care of until the British...
...can relieve us of them, according to the Code.
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.
Is that the influence of Major Lawrence?
Why should you suppose?
It's just that I heard in Cairo that...
...Major Lawrence has a horror of bloodshed.
That is exactly so.
With Major Lawrence, mercy is a passion.
With me, it is merely good manners.
You may judge which motive is the more reliable.
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.
Thank you, sir.
Can you manage the letter...?
I'll do everything I have said...
...if you will tell me truly the nature of your interest...
...in my people and Major Lawrence.
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.
Oh, no.
But influential men back home believe it's time for America...
...to lend her weight to the struggle against Germany.
And Turkey.
I've been sent to find material to show our people that this war is...
- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.
But to show it in its more adventurous aspects.
You look for a figure who will draw your country towards war.
All right. Yes.
Lawrence is your man.
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Come on, men!
Lawrence!
Good God! God!
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed with a sword before.
Why don't you take a picture?
Wish I had.
How is it with thee, Lawrence?
Am I in this?
Did you take his picture?
Yeah.
You are using up your nine lives very quickly.
Charming company you keep.
Auda?
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks these things will steal his virtue.
He thinks you're a kind of thief.
It's all right to take your picture?
- All right.
- Okay.
Just walk.
Major Lawrence!
Yes, sir, that's my baby.
This looting has got to stop!
It is customary.
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.
I would not say that to Auda.
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?
- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.
Well, there's another lot you've seen the last of.
They'll come back.
He says they'll come back.
Will they?
Not this year, Lawrence.
Look, Lawrence, how many men do you think you'll have left? 200?
- Less.
- Well, then?
I said, they'll come back.
You badly hurt?
Not hurt at all.
Didn't you know? They can only kill me with a golden bullet.
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?
I will tell you that when I have a country.
Did I answer well?
You answered without saying anything. That's politics.
You learn quickly.
I have a good teacher.
Yeah.
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.
Before I return to the fleshpots, which I shall be very glad to do...
...may I put two questions to you, straight?
I'd be interested to hear you put a question straight.
One.
What, in your opinion, do these people hope to gain from this war?
They hope to gain their freedom.
Freedom.
"They hope to gain their freedom."
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.
I'm going to give it to them.
- The second question?
- Well, I was going to ask...
...what is it that attracts you personally to the desert?
It's clean.
Well, now...
...that's a very illuminating answer.
May I...
...take one farewell picture?
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.
One clock for two lamps.
A fair bargain.
Fair? I robbed him.
Trash.
I must find something honorable.
Honorable?
The year is running out, Brighton.
I must find something honorable.
Now you may blow up my train.
And what will you do now?
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.
They will carry my toys too, see?
Major Lawrence will campaign this winter.
But you got what you wanted, so you're going home, is that it?
Of course. When Lawrence has got what he wants, he will go home.
When you've got what you want, you will go home.
No, I shan't, Auda.
Then you are a fool.
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.
Give thanks to God, Brighton...
...that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool's face.
You are an impudent rascal.
I must go, Lawrence, before I soil myself with a fool's blood.
Like talking to a brick wall.
So what will you do now?
What can you do?
I'll go north.
That's what Allenby wants.
Allenby wanted the Arab army behind Deraa.
Then that's where I'll take it.
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.
Won't we?
Train, Farraj.
Yeah, Lawrence.
Hide yourself, my friend.
Detonator.
All right, fetch another.
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put...
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.
Farraj?
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.
If they take him alive, you know what they'll do to him.
Daud will be angry with you.
Salute him for me.
What will you do now?
Go north.
With twenty?
What would you recommend me to do?
What would you recommend?
He hasn't 1 l10 so many men, sir.
He's lied, in fact.
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have done anything he hasn't done.
Then there is an Arab north army.
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea why?
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?
No.
He would if he could, I think.
- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.
What matters is I believed it.
The Turks believe it.
They are offering 20,000 pounds for him.
Good heavens.
- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Whatever else, he's a brave man...
Surely, surely. If he's still going north with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.
I wonder if they'd offer that much for me.
What about next year?
Will they still come back?
I wouldn't be surprised.
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.
One more failure and you will find yourself alone.
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.
So say they love you.
The more reason to be thrifty with them.
Give them something to do that can be done. But you, no.
They must move mountains, walk on water.
That's right. That's right.
Who are you to know what can be done?
If we'd done what you thought could be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.
Whatever I ask them to do can be done. They know that if you don't.
Do you think I'm just anybody?
Do you?
My friends, who will walk on water with me?
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.
Will you take 20 against 2000?
- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?
Because I told the English generals...
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa when they'd be in Jerusalem.
Or perhaps you are here...
...for the English generals.
Who says this?
Rumour.
That is not an argument.
Oh, argument.
This afternoon I will take the Arab revolt into Deraa...
...while the Arabs argue.
Can you pass for an Arab in an Arab town?
Yes. If one of you would lend me some dirty clothes.
It's madness.
What are you looking for?
Some way to announce myself.
Be patient with him, God.
- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.
Halt!
Walk on.
- Halt!
- Walk on.
You and you.
You.
You have blue eyes.
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.
How old are you?
Twenty-seven, effendi.
I think.
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.
It's an interesting face.
I am surrounded by cattle.
He wouldn't know an interesting face from a sow's belly.
I have been is Deraa now for three and a half years.
If they posted me to the dark side of the moon, I could not be more...
...isolated.
You haven't the least idea what I'm talking about.
No, effendi.
Have you?
No.
That would be too...
...lucky.
Where did you get that?
- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.
Yes, you are a deserter.
But from which army?
Not that it matters at all.
A man cannot be always in uniform.
Your skin is very fair.
Beat him.
To me!
Sleep.
Sleep.
Eat.
Eat.
You have a body, like other men.
Good.
Then sleep.
Better?
Much better. You were right.
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?
Oh, I've learned all right.
I'm going, Ali.
- Why?
- Why?
Heavens.
Why?
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.
And the end of the Arab revolt?
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.
You proved it.
Look, Ali. Look.
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.
He can...
...but he can't want what he wants.
This is the stuff that decides what he wants.
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.
- I tried to.
- So would any man.
Well, any man is what I am.
And I'm going back to Allenby to ask him for a job...
...that any man can do.
Allenby's in Jerusalem.
- I'll make easy stages.
- You?
Oh, yes. Easy stages.
Look, Ali, I think I see a way of being just...
...ordinarily...
...happy.
Can I take this?
It is not clean.
No, but it's warm.
And these...
...having led them here, have you no care for them?
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.
And let me go back to mine.
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.
Mind if I join you?
Honoured, sir.
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.
- What's doing out there?
- Where?
- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.
Jolly good.
Well, I have to go up there.
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.
Bloody wogs.
Yes, probably.
Jolly good about the squash court.
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?
Morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good to be back.
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.
Hello.
Morning. You're to go right in.
Lawrence.
Or is it Major Lawrence?
Sir.
Well, general, I will leave you.
Major Lawrence doubtless has reports to make...
...about my people and their weakness...
...and the need to keep them in the British interest.
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.
Yes, general, you have lied most bravely, but not convincingly.
I know this treaty does exist.
Treaty, sir?
He does it better than you, general.
But then, of course, he is almost an Arab.
You really don't know?
Then what the devil's this?
It's my request for release from Arabia, sir.
For what reason?
You sure you haven't heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?
No.
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.
Well, now...
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.
Monsieur Picot is a French civil servant.
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met, and they agreed that after the war...
...France and England should share the Turkish Empire.
Including Arabia.
They signed an agreement, not a treaty, sir.
An agreement to that effect.
There may be honour among thieves, but there's none in politicians.
And let's have no displays of indignation.
You may not have known, but you certainly had suspicions.
If we've told lies, you've told half-lies.
And a man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth.
But a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it.
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.
You might have told me that, Dryden.
And I want an ordinary job, sir.
That's my reason for resigning.
It's personal.
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.
And as it happens, a damned important one. Are you mad?
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.
That's my reason too.
Look, I'm making my big push on Damascus the 16th of next month...
...and you are part of it.
Can you understand that? You're an important part of the big push!
I don't want to be part of your big push!
What about your Arab friends?
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?
I've told you, I just want my ration of common humanity.
- Lawrence.
- Yes?
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.
Thank you, sir.
Why don't we?
There's blood on your back.
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.
Tell me what happened.
Say, what goes on in there?
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!
- No, really. Nothing at all.
- Is the man in trouble?
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.
- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.
When the war's over, he can be anything he wants.
Yes. Well, at the moment he wants to be somebody else.
Will you kindly allow me to pass?
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.
Always walking away, aren't you?
Well, I'll tell you.
It's a clash of temperament that's going on in there.
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.
I believe your name will be a household word...
...when you'd have to go to the war museum to find who Allenby was.
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.
Leave me alone.
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.
All right, I'm extraordinary.
What of it?
Not many people have a destiny, Lawrence.
It's a terrible thing for a man to flunk it if he has.
Are you speaking from experience?
No.
You're guessing, then.
Suppose you're wrong.
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all...
- The 16th?
- Can you do it?
I'll give you a lot of money.
- Artillery?
- I can't.
They won't be coming for money, not the best of them.
They'll be coming for Damascus.
Which I'm going to give them.
That's all I want.
All you want is someone holding down the Turkish Right.
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.
Tell the politicians to burn their paper now.
Fair enough.
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?
It's going to happen.
I shall want quite a lot of money.
All there is.
Not that much.
The best of them won't come for money.
They'll come for me.
No pictures!
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.
He doesn't mind having his picture taken. He doesn't mind at all.
Well, there's only one Lawrence.
Have you met Major Lawrence since he's come back?
Yes.
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.
What did that Turkish general do to him in Deraa?
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.
What did the English general do to him in Jerusalem?
Search me. Ask Lawrence.
- I did.
- What did he say?
He laughed.
He told me to gather the Harith here.
He offered me money.
Did you take it?
No. But many did.
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.
There is not a man without a price on his head.
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.
The sheiks will hang these men.
These men are mine.
Lawrence, these things know nothing of the Arab revolt.
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.
Aye, but for what?
Sherif, for Lawrence.
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!
Damascus!
Damascus! Damascus!
Damascus! Damascus!
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's gone through Mazril and Deraa.
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.
If the enemy's retreating in any order, which we'll assume...
Certainly.
He can't be far from Mallud...
...in which case I can have him within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.
Splendid. Philip.
These are the last infantry supports going up now.
But Mallud, we could have the fusiliers there by Wednesday.
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.
Any questions?
This Arab army on the right, sir, what's it consist of?
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.
Where are they now?
- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.
Pound them, Charley.
Pound them.
God help the men who lie under that.
They're Turks.
God help them.
Well, he's got the bit between his teeth all right.
Cocky?
More than cocky, sir.
He's got the bit between his teeth all right.
I tell you, sir, I think he'll get to Damascus before we do.
- Unless...
- Unless?
Well, there's a Turkish column in front of him, out of Mazril.
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.
I wonder where they are now.
No prisoners.
Damascus, Lawrence.
Lawrence, not this.
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.
No prisoners.
This was Talaal's village.
Talaal!
Talaal!
No prisoners!
No prisoners!
God.
God.
God!
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!
Major!
Major Lawrence!
Jesus wept.
Jesus wept.
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?
Surely you know the Arabs are a barbarous people.
Barbarous and cruel.
Who but they?
Who but they?
Oh, you rotten man.
Here, let me take your rotten bloody picture.
For the rotten bloody newspapers.
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.
Damascus!
Take them to Sherif Ali.
Tell him.
Remind him.
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Near.
Tell Sherif Ali that.
They are not ripe.
General salute!
Present arms!
Port arms!
Lawrence is behind it, sir.
The whole town is plastered with the Arab flag.
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.
They've been here a day and a night.
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.
He's set up his own headquarters in the town hall.
What else beside the town hall?
Telephone exchange, post office, powerhouse...
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.
They call themselves the Arab National Council...
...and they're in the town hall.
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.
What should we do about it?
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.
How about that, Dryden?
Not unless you want a full-scale rising.
- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?
By special train in two days' time.
Two days.
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.
- Isn't it enough?
- Yes.
- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.
And Tracey, all troops to remain quartered until further orders.
Does that apply to technical units?
Technical units particularly.
Yes, sir.
Medicals too, sir?
I'm afraid so, Harry.
Medicals too.
We here...
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...
...of the Arab Council, acting for Prince Feisal.
He insulted me.
Sherif Ali said that the telephones are in the care of the Howeitat...
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.
They will not work because they are given no electricity.
The electricity is in the care of the Harith.
If you answer, there will be bloodshed.
You speak to me of bloodshed?
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.
Humbly?
Humbly, Harith?
Yes, humbly.
This is a new trick.
Why is there no electricity?
I have been to that electrical house, Lawrence.
There are three large machines.
He means generators!
So.
One of them is burning.
They are of an incredible size, but helpless.
It is so of all machines.
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.
No. Take English engineers and you take English government.
Take...
Fire has broken out.
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!
Then use the fire brigade!
We have tried, but there is no force in the water.
Then you must carry it.
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?
We will hear petitions this afternoon.
This afternoon!
- I'll take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?
All I can say is, sir, it's a heavy responsibility.
Sorry, sir.
Maybe it's the bulb.
No, sir.
It's the power.
They're leaving.
That's it, then.
Marvellous-Iooking beggars, aren't they?
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.
- Come where?
- Back.
I know your heart.
What is it?
Is it this?
I tell you, this is nothing.
Is it the blood?
The desert has dried up more blood than you could think of.
I pray that I may never see the desert again.
Hear me, God.
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.
What about you?
No, I shall stay here and learn politics.
A very low occupation.
I had not thought of it when I met you.
You have tried very hard to give us Damascus.
It's what I came for.
And then...
...it would be something.
Yes.
Much.
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.
- You love him.
- I fear him.
Then why do you weep?
If I fear him, who love him...
...how must he fear himself, who hates himself?
Take your hand away, Howeitat!
So you are not yet entirely politician.
Not yet.
Well, these are new tricks, and I am an old dog.
And Allah be thanked.
I'll tell thee what...
...being an Arab will be thornier than you suppose, Harith.
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.
It comes within the jurisdiction of the Arab Council.
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.
Under any circumstances at all, you must obey your orders.
No, sir, I will not.
Control yourself.
Now, go over to the town hall and see what they say.
We did what we could in the civic hospitals.
But you forgot the Turkish Military Hospital.
It has 600 beds. There are about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.
All of whom are the responsibility of your precious Arab Council.
What's it like?
This is outrageous!
Outrageous!
Outrageous!
You filthy little wog!
My friend Lawrence, if I may call him that.
"My friend Lawrence."
How many men will claim the right to use that phrase? How proudly.
He longs for the greenness of his native land.
He pines for the Gothic cottages of Surrey, is it not?
Already in imagination, he catches trout...
...and all the activities of the English gentleman.
That's me you're describing, sir, not Colonel Lawrence.
You're promoted colonel.
Yes. What for?
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin to yourself on the boat home.
Then, thank you.
Well, then...
...Godspeed.
There's nothing further here for a warrior.
We drive bargains. Old men's work.
Young men make wars, and the virtues of war...
...are the virtues of young men.
Courage and hope for the future.
Then old men make the peace.
And the vices of peace are the vices of old men.
Mistrust and caution.
It must be so.
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.
The powerhouse, the telephone exchange, these I concede.
The pumping plant I must retain.
If you retain it, there will be no water.
- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.
I shall not, and if your men attempt it, my men will resist it.
- Have you men?
- Enough of that.
It's a thing that makes an ugly incident.
I'm sure your government...
...does not wish to appear at the peace conference as an aggressor.
I say!
It's Lawrence, isn't it?
May I shake your hand, sir?
Just want to be able to say I'd done it, sir.
Haven't we met before?
Don't think so, sir.
No, no, sir, I should remember that.
It is widely known the Arab Council took power in my name.
They have no power. It's illusory.
Illusions can be very powerful.
Particularly...
...when they take this form.
The world is delighted at the picture of Damascus...
...liberated by the Arab army.
Led, may I remind you, by a British-serving officer.
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence is a sword with two edges.
We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?
I thought I was a hard man, sir.
You are merely a general.
I must be a king.
Excuse me, sir.
Well?
Well...
...it seems we're to have a British waterworks...
...with an Arab flag on it.
Do you think it was worth it?
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.
Yes, sir.
So you keep saying.
You, I suspect...
...are chief architect of this compromise.
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.
Well, sir. Going home.
Home, sir.
Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you
Though it breaks my heart to go
I didn't know it was so bad.
Couple of incendiaries, these old buildings go up like cellophane.
There's a wall that separates the old section of Nuremberg from the new.
Goes back to...
How far does it go back, Schmidt?
- 1219, sir.
This is where the Nazi Party held their rallies, isn't it?
They all came here.
Hitler. Goebbels. The whole crew.
Thousands of them, from all over Germany.
Does he have to blow that damn horn so much?
It's not necessary to blow the horn so much, Schmidt.
You both know your duties?
Well, here we are.
A little bit of old Germany.
- Senator Burkette.
- Captain.
Captain Byers, this is Judge Haywood.
- Byers here will be your aide.
- My what?
Clerk. General guide. Liaison.
Any capacity you wish to use me in.
This will be your staff, sir.
Mr. And Mrs. Halbestadt.
Hello.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Your Honor.
Welcome.
You've already met your driver, Schmidt.
I am at your service any time you need me.
Day or night.
Thanks.
Let's show him around the rest of the place. Dan?
We're in the reception room.
Living room.
Study is in there.
There are two bedrooms on this floor, three upstairs.
Furniture is part antique, part US Army.
The piano's showing signs of wear and tear, but it's a genuine Bechstein.
Quite a view, isn't it, sir?
Senator, I really don't need all this.
The United States government always does it right.
- You know that, Dan.
- Who used to live here?
An important Nazi general and his wife, sir.
Let's see. Is there anything else
Judge Haywood ought to know?
Sir, are there any questions?
Yes.
- You're West Point, aren't you, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
- What's your first name?
- Harrison. Harry.
Harry, look, I'm not West Point.
And all this formality gets me down a little, not to say puts me ill at ease.
Do you think it would be too much an infraction of the rules... if you were to call me Judge, or Dan, or something?
Okay, Judge.
We shop at the army commissary.
There isn't enough food at the local markets for the Germans.
The driver knows where it is.
Here's a copy of the indictment of the case.
Thought you might want to look it over.
I hope you'll be comfortable here, sir.
Captain, I think the whole state of Maine would be comfortable here.
My office is next to yours at the Palace of Justice...
- if you need anything.
- Thank you.
Senator?
Do you think
I really need the three servants?
It kind of makes me feel like a damn fool.
It helps them out, as well as you.
You see, here they eat.
I need three servants.
It's good to have a man of your stature here, Dan.
Sure.
I was the only man in America qualified for this job.
Senator, you know I wasn't the first choice, nor even the tenth.
- You know it, and I know it.
- What do you mean?
Let's face it.
Hitler is gone, Goebbels is gone.
Goering is gone. Committed suicide before they could hang him.
Now we're down to the business of judging the doctors, businessmen and judges.
Some people think they shouldn't be judged at all.
So?
So it makes for a hell of a lack of candidates for the job.
You had to beat the backwoods of Maine to come up with a hick like me.
I hope you're not sorry you came.
No. I'm not sorry I came.
I just wanted you to know that I know where the body is buried.
No, I think the trials should go on.
Especially the trials of the German judges.
I hope I'm up to it.
You're up to it.
Relax.
Thanks.
Enjoy this place while you can.
You're going to be a pretty busy fellow.
Thanks for everything, Senator.
- See you tomorrow, Judge.
- Right.
Shall we take these upstairs?
Yes. Thank you.
- Here, I can take that--
- No, let me take it. Please.
Here they come.
The tribunal is now in session.
God bless the United States and this honorable tribunal.
The tribunal will now arraign the defendants.
The microphone will be placed in front of the defendant, Emil Hahn.
Emil Hahn?
Are you represented by counsel before this tribunal?
Not guilty.
The question was, are you represented by counsel before this tribunal?
I am represented.
How do you plead to the charges and specifications... in the indictment against you?
Guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty on all counts.
Friedrich Hoffstetter?
Are you represented by counsel before this tribunal?
I am represented.
How do you plead? 
Guilty or not guilty?
You may be seated.
Werner Lammpe?
Are you represented by counsel before this tribunal?
Counsel?
Yes, of course. 
I am represented.
How do you plead to the charges?
Guilty or not guilty?
You may be seated.
Ernst Janning?
Are you represented by counsel before this tribunal?
Are you represented by counsel before this tribunal?
I represent the defendant, Your Honor.
How do you plead to the charges and specifications set forth... in the indictment against you?
Guilty or not guilty?
Your Honor, may I address the court?
The defendant does not recognize the authority of this tribunal... and wishes to lodge a formal protest in lieu of pleading.
A plea of "not guilty" will be entered.
The prosecution will begin its opening address.
Slow and easy, Junior.
The case is unusual... in that the defendants are charged with crimes... committed in the name of the law.
These men, together with their deceased or fugitive colleagues... are the embodiment of what passed for justice during the Third Reich.
The defendants served as judges during the period of the Third Reich.
Therefore, you, Your Honors, as judges on the bench... will be sitting in judgment... of judges in the dock.
And this is as it should be.
For only a judge knows how much more a court is than a courtroom.
It is a process and a spirit.
It is the house of law.
The defendants knew this, too.
They knew courtrooms well.
They sat in their black robes... and they distorted, they perverted, they destroyed justice and law in Germany.
Will the prosecution please watch the light?
- The interpreter cannot follow you.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
They distorted, they perverted... they destroyed justice and law in Germany.
Now, this in itself is undoubtedly a great crime.
But the prosecution is not calling the defendants... to account for violating constitutional guarantees... or withholding due process of law.
The prosecution is calling them to account... for murder... brutalities... torture... atrocities.
They share with all the leaders of the Third Reich... responsibility for the most malignant, the most calculated... the most devastating crimes in the history of all mankind.
And they are perhaps more guilty than some of the others.
For they had attained maturity long before Hitler's rise to power.
Their minds weren't warped at an early age by Nazi teachings.
They embraced the ideologies of the Third Reich as educated adults... when they, most of all... should have valued justice.
Here they'll receive the justice they denied others.
They'll be judged according to the evidence presented in this courtroom.
The prosecution asks nothing more.
Herr Rolfe will make the opening statement for the defense.
May it please the tribunal... it is not only a great honor... but also a great challenge... for an advocate... to aid this tribunal in its task.
The entire civilized world... will follow closely what we do here.
For this is not an ordinary trial... by any means of the accepted, parochial sense.
The avowed purpose of this tribunal...
Is broader than the visiting of retribution on a few men.
It is dedicated to the reconsecration... of the temple of justice.
It is dedicated to finding a code of justice... the whole world will be responsible to.
How will this code be established?
It will be established... in a clear... honest evaluation... of the responsibility for the crimes in the indictment stated by the prosecution.
In the words of the great American jurist,
Oliver Wendell Holmes:
"This responsibility will not be found only in documents...
"that no one contests or denies.
"It will be found in considerations of a political or social nature.
"It will be found, most of all...
"in the character of men."
What is the character of Ernst Janning?
Let us examine his life for a moment.
He was born in 1885.
Received the degree of Doctor of Law in 1907.
Became a judge in East Prussia in 1940.
Following WWI, he became one of the leaders of the Weimar Republic... and was one of the framers of its democratic constitution.
In subsequent years he achieved international fame... not only for his work as a great jurist, but also as the author of legal text books... which are still used in universities all over the world.
He became Minister of Justice in Germany in 1935.
If Ernst Janning is to be found guilty... certain implications must arise.
A judge does not make the laws.
He carries out the laws of his country.
The statement:
"My country, right or wrong..." was expressed by a great American patriot.
It is no less true for a German patriot.
Should Ernst Janning have carried out the laws of his country?
Or should he have refused to carry them out and become a traitor?
This is the crux of the issue at the bottom of this trial.
The defense is as dedicated to finding responsibility... as is the prosecution.
For it is not only Ernst Janning who is on trial here... it is the German people.
The tribunal will recess until further notification.
If it's all right with you,
Byers can file these briefs later.
That was quite a damning speech by Col. Lawson, wasn't it?
I wonder if those men in the dock can really be responsible... for the things he listed in the indictment.
I've been here for two years, and after that long... you find that responsibility is not a cut-and-dried thing.
What are you fellows up to over the weekend?
My wife and I are going to Liège.
There's nothing in Liège. 
I've been there.
My son was in the 101st.
He's buried in the American cemetery outside Liège.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
See you Monday, Dan.
Coming my way?
No, I'm going to stay here for a moment.
I'm waiting for some records from Byers.
Right.
Here are the reports you asked for, sir.
Thank you.
Captain, do you think you can get me a copy of the books Ernst Janning wrote?
- There are quite a few of them.
- I'd like all of them.
And also a copy of the Weimar constitution.
- Do you think you can get that for me?
- Of course.
Thank you.
- How long have you been here, Captain?
- Two years.
- Two years? That's a long time.
- Yes, sir.
- Any friends?
- Sure.
German friends?
Yes.
A girl?
Yes.
Her parents were Nazis, but she was eight when they came in.
- I didn't ask you that.
- I know.
But maybe you were thinking it.
It's natural to think about it.
I thought if anybody was going to indoctrinate her, it might as well be me.
Will there be anything else?
No, I think I'll just take a walk around town on my own.
Try the old section.
Everyone stops for beer and sausage there.
Thank you.
- Do you understand English?
- Yes, a little.
- What did she say?
- She said, "Goodbye, Grandpa."
Are they treating you all right?
Yes. They're treating me all right.
We still have some friends... who have contact with the American authorities.
I can tell them if they're not treating you all right.
They're treating me all right.
Dr. Janning... we are both in an embarrassing position.
I know you didn't want me as your counsel.
I know you didn't want anyone.
But I must tell you something.
Will you listen to me?
Yes.
I intend to represent your case with complete dignity.
There will be... no appeal to sentiment, no falling at the mercy of the court.
The game... will be played according to their own rules.
We'll see whether they have the courage to sit in judgment on a man like you.
The way I see it... the most important elements in the case... are the sterilization decrees, and the Feldenstein-Hoffman affair.
Dr. Janning, I must tell you something.
I admired you... since I was a boy in the university.
It was because I thought
I might be able to achieve... some of the things you have done... that saw me through the war.
You have been somebody to look up to, for all of us.
Is that all, Herr Rolfe?
Yes.
Thank you.
Dr. Wieck, do you know the defendant,
Ernst Janning?
Yes, I know him.
Will you tell us in what capacity?
We served in the Ministry of Justice together from 1929 till 1935.
Did you know him before that?
Yes.
He was a law student of mine.
- Did you know him well?
- Yes.
- Was he a protégé of yours?
- Yes.
Why?
He was always a man of great intelligence.
He was a man born with the qualities of a great legal mind.
Would you tell us from your own experience... the position of the judge in Germany prior to the advent of Adolf Hitler.
The position of the judge was one of complete independence.
Now, would you describe the contrast, if any... after the coming to power of National Socialism in 1933?
Judges became subject to something outside of objective justice.
They became subject to what was necessary for the protection of the country.
Would you explain this, please?
The first consideration of the judge... became the punishment of acts against the state... rather than objective consideration of the case.
And what other changes were there?
The right to appeal was eliminated.
The Supreme Court of the Reich was replaced by...
People's and Special Courts.
The concept of race was made a legal concept for the first time.
And what was the result of this?
The result?
The result was to hand over the administration of justice... into the hands of the dictatorship.
Now, Dr. Wieck...
Col. Lawson, I would like to ask a few questions.
Did the judiciary protest these laws abridging their independence?
A few of them did.
Those who did resigned, or were forced to resign.
Others adapted themselves to the new situation.
Do you think the judiciary was aware of the consequences to come?
At first, perhaps not.
Later it became clear to anyone who had eyes and ears.
Thank you.
Now, would you please describe for us the changes in criminal law?
It was characterized by... an ever-increasing inflation of the death penalty.
Sentences were passed against defendants... just because they were Poles, or Jews, or politically undesirable.
Novel National Socialist measures were introduced.
Among them... sexual sterilization for those who were categorized as asocial.
Did it become necessary for judges... to wear any distinctive mark on their robes in 1935?
The so-called Fuehrer's Decree... required judges to wear the insignia of the swastika on their robes.
- Did you wear such an insignia?
- No.
I would have been ashamed to wear it.
Did you resign in 1935?
Yes, sir.
Did Ernst Janning wear a swastika on his robe?
Yes.
That's all. Thank you.
Herr Rolfe.
You used the phrase, "What was necessary for the protection of the country."
Will you explain for the tribunal... the conditions in Germany at the time
National Socialism came to power?
What conditions?
Would you say there was widespread hunger?
Yes.
Would you say there was internal disunity?
Yes.
Was there a Communist Party?
Yes.
Was it the third-largest party in Germany?
Yes.
Would you say... that National Socialism helped to cure some of these conditions?
Yes, but at a terrible price--
Please confine yourself to answering the questions only.
Therefore, was it not possible that a judge might wear a swastika... and yet work for what he thought was best for his country?
No. It was not possible.
You were not in the administration... from the years 1935 to 1943... by your own admission.
Is it not possible that your view of the administration... might be distorted?
No. It is not.
How can you testify about what was going on in the administration... if you were not there?
I had many friends in the legal administration.
There were journals and books.
From journals and books?
I see.
You referred to:
"Novel National Socialist measures introduced...
"among them sexual sterilization."
Are you aware that sexual sterilization was not invented by National Socialism... but had been advanced for years before as a weapon... in dealing with the mentally incompetent and the criminal?
Yes. I am aware of that.
Are you aware that it has advocates among leading citizens in other countries?
I am not an expert on such laws.
Then permit me to read one to you.
This is a High Court opinion... upholding such laws in existence in another country.
And I quote:
"We have seen more than once that the public welfare...
"may call upon the best citizens for their lives.
"It would be strange indeed, if it could not call upon those...
"who already sapped the strength of the state for these lesser sacrifices...
"in order to prevent our being swamped by incompetence.
"It is better for all the world...
"if, instead of waiting to execute degenerate offsprings for crime...
"or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent their propagation...
"by medical means in the first place.
"Three generations of imbeciles are enough."
Do you recognize it now, Dr. Wieck?
No, sir, I don't.
Actually, there is no particular reason you should... since the opinion upholds the sterilization law... in the State of Virginia, of the United States... and was written and delivered by that great American jurist...
Supreme Court Justice,
Oliver Wendell Holmes.
Now, Dr. Wieck.
In view of what you have just learned... can you still say that sexual sterilization was a novel National Socialist measure?
Yes, I can say it.
Because it was never before used as a weapon against political opponents.
Do you personally know of a case... where someone was sterilized for political reasons?
I know that such things were done.
That's not the question.
Please answer the question.
Do you know of a case?
I don't know of any specific case, or specific date--
I am asking you if you have any firsthand, personal knowledge of such a case!
No, I have no such personal knowledge.
Thank you.
You are aware of the charges in the indictment against Ernst Janning?
Yes, I am.
Can you honestly say he is responsible for them?
Yes, I can.
Do you consider yourself free of responsibility?
Yes, I do.
Did you ever swear to the 
Civil Servant Loyalty Oath of 1934?
Your Honor, I object.
The witness doesn't have to answer that question.
He's not on trial.
All Germany is on trial, Your Honor.
This tribunal placed it on trial when it placed Ernst Janning on trial.
If responsibility is to be found, the widest latitude is to be permitted.
Objection overruled.
Did you ever swear to the 
Civil Servant Loyalty Oath of 1934?
Everyone did.
We are not interested in what everyone did.
We are interested in what you did.
Would you read the oath from the 
Reich Law Gazette, March, 1933?
"I swear that I shall be obedient...
"to the leader of the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler.
"That I shall be loyal to him, that I will observe the laws...
"and that I will conscientiously fulfill my duties...
"so help me God."
Everyone swore to it.
It was mandatory.
Yes.
But you're such a perceptive man, 
Dr. Wieck.
You could see what was coming.
You could see that National Socialism was leading Germany to disaster.
"It was clear to anyone who had eyes and ears."
Didn't you realize... what it would have meant if you, and men like you... would have refused to swear to the oath?
It would have meant that Hitler could never have come to absolute power.
Why didn't you?
Why didn't you?
Can you give us an explanation?
Has it something to do with your pension?
Did your pension mean more to you than your country?
Your Honor!
I object to the entire line of questioning, and ask that it be stricken from the record.
I thought prosecuting counsel was dedicated to finding responsibility.
Your Honor, I made an objection.
Prosecution is not interested in finding responsibility?
There is responsibility for more here than swearing to a loyalty oath...
- and you know it.
- There is indeed.
One thing that even the German machine, with its monumental efficiency... has been unable to destroy...
Order.
All the victims.
More victims than the world has ever known.
- They will walk into this courtroom--
- Order!
This tribunal will admonish both counsel.
It will tolerate nothing of this kind again.
We're not here to listen to outbursts of this kind, but to serve justice.
Your Honor, I made an objection.
The objection is overruled.
The witness is excused.
Did you ever read any books by Janning?
No, I don't think so.
- The Meaning of the Law.
- How is it? Interesting?
All the books by Janning are interesting.
They're more than that.
They're a picture of an era, its hopes, its aspirations.
They weren't very different from ours, really.
Listen to this, on the signing of the Weimar constitution:
"Now we can look forward to a Germany without guns and bloodshed...
"a Germany of justice, where men can live instead of die...
"a Germany of purpose, of freedom, of humanity...
"a Germany that calls for the best in man."
Now, how could a man who wrote words like these... be part of sterilizations and murders?
How could he be?
There are a lot of things that happened here that nobody understands.
I know.
But the prosecution will have to prove... every inch of its allegation... against a man like Janning if I'm to pronounce sentence on him.
Gentlemen, I'm on my way. 
Coming, Ken?
Right.
There's just this business on the curtailment of rights.
Tomorrow.
Dan, my wife is planning a little get-together tomorrow night at the Grand Hotel.
She wants you to come.
I thank you.
And she'd like to provide you with some kind of female companionship.
She has a feeling that you might be lonely here.
No, thanks, Curtiss. 
Thanks very much.
You know how these wives are.
They love to play Cupid.
I think I'll keep it stag.
All right. 
How about you, Ken?
Thanks. My wife and I have an engagement. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, Dan.
Mrs. Halbestadt, could I--
Hello.
Hello.
Your Honor, this is Madame Bertholt.
This is His Honor, Judge Haywood.
Madame Bertholt, this is her house.
She came to get some of her belongings from the basement.
I didn't know she was coming.
This is my responsibility, Mrs. Halbestadt.
I've been storing some of my things here... until I could get a room large enough to keep them in.
I hope you don't mind.
No. Not at all.
You can examine what I have here, if you like.
Of course not.
Then I'll just take these out.
- Here.
- Thanks, Mrs. Halbestadt.
- Let me help you.
- No. I can manage all right.
I'll take these outside. Please.
Good night.
It's heavy. 
It's full of books and pictures... things that mean nothing to anyone but me.
- Mr. Schmidt?
- Your Honor.
Would you drive
Mrs. Bertholt home, please?
Yes, Your Honor.
- I hope you're comfortable here.
- Yes, I am. Very.
My favorite spot was always the garden.
Remind Mr. Halbestadt to take good care of the rock garden.
You'll get a great deal of pleasure out of it in summer.
I'll sit in front, thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Karolinenstrasse 115, please.
- Yes, madam.
Sit down.
You worked for Mrs. Bertholt, didn't you?
Yes, Your Honor.
How long did she live here?
Madame Bertholt?
Madame Bertholt and her family have lived here for many generations, Your Honor.
Thank you.
Your Honor, you came in here for something?
I was just going to make myself a sandwich.
- We will make it for you.
- No.
- We will make anything you want.
- No. It's nothing.
I always used to do it for myself back home.
What would you like? 
I have some ham and cheese and liverwurst.
Cheese will be fine.
That's very kind of you.
What was it like, living under National Socialism?
What was it like?
Yes. I mean, day to day?
You know, I know many people at home like you.
You're good people. 
I believe that.
What was it like for you, living under Hitler?
We were not political.
Mr. Halbestadt and I are not political.
No, but... you must have been aware of some of the events that were going on.
Many things were going on.
There were parades.
Hitler and Goebbels came here every year.
What was it like?
We never attended meetings. 
Never.
I'm not trying to put you on trial.
I'm just curious. 
I'd like to know.
- Here's your sandwich, Your Honor.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
For instance, there was a place called Dachau... which was not too many miles from here.
Did you ever know what was going on there?
We knew nothing about it.
How can you ask if we knew anything about that?
I'm sorry.
Your Honor, we are only little people.
We lost a son in the army... and our daughter in the bombing.
During the war we almost starved.
It was terrible for us.
I'm sure it was.
Hitler did some good things.
I won't say he didn't do some good things.
He built the Autobahn.
He gave more people work.
We won't say he didn't do some good things.
But the other things... the things they say he did to the Jews and the rest... we knew nothing about that.
Very few Germans did.
And if we did know... what could we do?
But Mrs. Halbestadt said you didn't know.
Mrs. Bertholt. 
How did she react to all this?
Madame Bertholt is a very fine woman,
Your Honor.
I'm sure she is. 
What about her husband?
He was in the army.
What happened to him?
He was one of the defendants in the Malmedy Case.
General Bertholt. Karl Bertholt.
He was executed, Your Honor.
Yes, I know that.
The document then states that the photographer, Rudolf Lenz... is requested to present himself within two weeks... at one the hospitals mentioned below... for medical treatment.
Next, prosecution presents affidavit document no. 488... which concerns the seamstress,
Anni Meunch.
Document reads as follows:
"District Court, Frankfurt am Main, has decided the following:
"The seamstress, Anni Meunch, daughter of Wilhelm Meunch...
"is to be sterilized.
"She is therefore requested to present herself within two weeks...
"at one of the hospitals mentioned below.
"If she does not take herself voluntarily...
"she will be taken by force."
Next, document no. 449... interrogatories in the 
German and English text... concerning the farmer's helper,
Meyer Eichinger.
Your Honor... defense objects to introduction of these repetitive documents.
According to the ruling of the first tribunal... such documents are not even admissible... unless supported by independent evidence of their authenticity.
Objection sustained.
Your Honor, may I ask the defense a question?
Yes.
Would evidence on sterilization be admissible if there were a witness?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Prosecution calls the witness,
Rudolph Petersen.
Will you raise your right hand?
I swear by God, the Almighty and Omniscient... that I will speak the pure truth and withhold and add nothing.
I do.
Will you please tell the court your full name and place of residence?
Rudolph Petersen.
Frankfurt am Main, Gratweg Nummer 7.
When were you born, Mr. Petersen?
May 20, 1914.
And what is your occupation?
I'm a baker's helper.
Are your parents living?
No.
What were the causes of their deaths?
Mr. Petersen, did they die of natural causes?
Yeah, natural.
What political party did your father belong to?
The Communist Party.
Now think back.
Do you remember anything unusual... that happened to you and your family in 1933... before the Nazis came to power?
I mean, anything of a violent nature.
Yeah.
How old were you at the time?
Nineteen.
Would you please tell the court what happened?
Some SA men broke into our house... and they broke the windows and the door... and they called us traitors... and they tried to beat up my father.
What happened then?
My brothers and I, we went to help him.
And there was a fight... and finally we got them outside in the street... and we beat them up... and turned them over to the police.
Did the police do anything about it?
- No.
- Why not?
It was then... at the time of the national elections.
You mean the time the National Socialists came to power?
Yeah.
What happened after 1933... after the Nazis came to power?
I got a job on a farm... but for the work, to drive a truck was necessary.
I went to the city building to apply for a license.
And what happened there?
They took me to an official.
Did you ever have any dealings with this official before?
He was one of the men... who broke into our house that night.
What did he say to your application?
He said an examination there would have to be.
Where was the examination to take place?
In the district court of Stuttgart.
Who was the presiding justice in the court?
Justice Hoffstetter.
What happened in the courtroom?
They asked me my full name... and so forth.
What else did they ask you?
They asked me when Adolf Hitler and Dr. Goebbels were born.
What did you reply?
I told them I didn't know, and also that I didn't care.
Did they ask you any more questions?
No. They told me that
I would be hearing from them in ten days.
I see. Now, Mr. Petersen...
I'd like you to look at something.
Do you recognize it?
Yeah.
Would you please read it for the tribunal?
"District Court of Stuttgart.
"The baker, Rudolph Petersen, born May 20, 1914...
"son of railway employee, 
Hans Petersen...
"is to be sterilized."
Now would you read the last paragraph?
"It is therefore requested...
"he present himself within two weeks...
"to one of the hospitals mentioned below.
"If he does not...
"betake himself voluntarily...
"he will be taken by force."
Please read the signature at the bottom.
"Presiding Justice Hoffstetter."
Would you read what is written below the signature?
- Below?
- Below.
"By authority of...
"Ernst Janning...
"Minister of Justice."
Your Honor... may the defense see the file of Mr. Petersen?
What did you do after you received the letter, Mr. Petersen?
I ran away.
I stayed at the farm of a friend I have.
And did you return?
- Did I what?
- Did you return?
Yes.
And what happened then?
The police came.
Where did they take you?
To the hospital.
Mr. Petersen, excuse me.
I wonder if you could speak a little louder, please.
To the hospital.
And what happened at the hospital?
They kept me there.
The nurse who was...
Well, she came in, anyway.
She was to prepare me for the operation.
And she said she thought the whole thing was terrible.
Then the doctor came in who was supposed to do the...
And he said he thought it was awful.
Were you, in fact, sterilized?
Thank you very much, Mr. Petersen.
That's all.
Herr Rolfe?
Mr. Petersen... you may take your earphones off now, if you want to.
You say you work as a baker's helper?
Is that correct?
Yes, that is right.
What other occupations have you held?
I have worked for my father.
What did your father do?
He was a railroad worker.
Yes, but what did he do?
He would raise and lower the barrier... at the crossing, for traffic.
And you spoke about your brothers.
How many brothers do you have?
Five.
And sisters?
Four.
- Then you are a family of ten?
- Yes.
What occupations do your brothers have?
Laborers.
All laborers? I see.
You said the court at Stuttgart asked you two questions:
The birth dates of Hitler and Dr. Goebbels.
Is that correct?
Yes, correct.
What else did they ask you?
Nothing else.
Are you sure?
Are you sure there were no questions about your schooling?
Objection!
The witness has already answered that question.
Objection sustained.
May I ask you... how long did you attend school?
Six years.
Six years? Why not longer?
I had to go to work.
Would you consider yourself a very bright fellow at school?
School?
It was a long while ago. 
I don't--
Perhaps you were not able to keep up with the others... and that's why you did not continue?
Objection, Your Honor.
The witness' school record has nothing to do with what happened to him.
It was the task of the Health Court to sterilize the mentally incompetent.
Objection overruled.
Were you able, or were you not able... to keep up with the others?
I would like to refer to the efficiency report made at the school about Mr. Petersen.
He failed to be promoted, and was placed in a class of backward children.
You say your parents died of natural causes.
Yes.
Would you describe in detail the illness your mother died of?
She died of her heart.
In the last stages of her illness, did your mother... show any mental peculiarities?
No.
In the decision that came down from Stuttgart... it is stated that your mother suffered from hereditary feeble-mindedness.
That is not true!
Can you give us some clarification... as to how the Hereditary Health Court in Stuttgart arrived at that decision?
It was just something they said to put me on the operating table.
- It was just something they said?
- Yes.
Mr. Petersen, there was a simple test... that the Health Court used to ask in all cases of mental incompetence.
Since you say they did not ask you then... perhaps you can answer it for us now.
Form a sentence out of the words
"Hare," "Hunter," "Field."
Your Honor, objection.
Was the court in Stuttgart constituted like this one?
I don't understand what--
Was there an audience?
An audience? Yes.
Thank you.
Objection overruled.
"Hare," "Hunter," "Field."
Take your time.
They had already made up--
When I walked into the court, they had made up their minds.
They put me in the hospital, like a criminal.
I could not say anything.
I could not do anything.
I had to lay there.
My mother... what you say about her... 
She was a woman, a servant woman who worked hard.
She was a hardworking woman... and it is not fair what you say.
Here.
I want to show you. 
I have here her picture.
I would like you to look at it.
I would like you to judge.
I want that you tell me... was she feeble-minded?
My mother!
Was she feeble-minded?
Was she?
I feel it is my duty to point out to the tribunal... that the witness is not in control of his mental processes.
I know I am not. 
Since that day.
I've been half I've ever been.
The tribunal does not know how you were before.
It can never know.
It has only your word.
Court is adjourned.
That's one problem we have with the prosecution.
It's filled with young radicals like Lawson.
Is that what Lawson is? 
A young radical?
He was a personal protégé of FDR.
FDR had a few friends who weren't radicals, didn't he?
Name one.
Wendell Wilkie.
Is he your idea of a conservative?
As a matter of fact, Dan,
I've been wondering how you stand.
I'll clarify that for you, Curtiss.
I'm a rock-ribbed Republican... who thought that Franklin Roosevelt was a great man.
One of those?
Max!
- Max Perkins. You know him?
- No, I don't think so.
He's with the United Press.
Max, what are you doing here?
I thought you might kick up a row or something.
I haven't had that much to drink.
- I'm sorry, this is Judge Ives.
- Hello.
- Mrs. Ives.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Judge Haywood, Mrs. Bertholt.
- We have met.
- Yes, we have.
Won't you join us for a drink?
We would like to very much.
- Max, will you sit here?
- Thank you.
Incidentally, Max, I admired your article on Mrs. Bertholt very much.
It was straight reporting.
Her defense of her husband was quite eloquent.
Are you going to do a story on these trials?
I'll tell you something frankly, Judge.
At the moment, I couldn't give a story away on the Nuremberg Trials.
What do you mean, Mr. Perkins?
The American public just isn't interested anymore.
But the war's only been over two years, Mr. Perkins.
That's right.
- May I take your order?
- Yes. See what the ladies will have.
How about some more beer, Dan?
No. I think I've had my fill of beer.
I'd like to try something else, if I may.
Why don't you try some Sonnenberg, or Schwalbenwinkel? It's the local wine.
- Sonnenberg or... 
- Schwalbenwinkel.
Yes, I think I'd like that.
Some Schweissenwinkel.
- Will you have some?
- Yes, thank you. I'll have the same.
- Should we stay with the beer, Max?
- Fine.
Thank you.
- You got home all right the other night?
- Yes, thank you.
I don't know what I would have done without the car.
You speak English very well, Mrs. Bertholt.
Thank you. My husband and I spent three years in America.
I hope you had a chance to see something of Nuremberg.
I'm afraid mainly the road between my house and the Palace of Justice.
And then some places that have to do with the case, the historical aspects.
The Nazi aspects.
You should see some of the other parts of Nuremberg.
There are many beautiful things to see in the old part of town.
Museums we're trying to rebuild.
And there's a concert, a piano concert next week at the old opera house.
Arthur Reiss. 
He was a refugee from Hitler in the early days.
We've persuaded him to come back.
It ought to be quite an evening.
Would you like to come?
Yes, I would.
I'll tell them to leave a ticket for you at the box office. I'm on the committee.
- Thank you very much, Mrs. Bertholt.
- It's nothing.
You see, I have a mission with the Americans, as Mr. Perkins can tell you.
What is that?
To convince you that we're not all monsters.
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Good evening.
Colonel. Maj. Radnitz.
Good evening, Mrs. Bertholt.
I hope you'll excuse me.
But you've just come--
No, I must go. Please excuse me.
It was awfully nice meeting you.
If you want to hear the concert, there'll be a ticket for you at the box office.
- Thank you.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mrs. Bertholt.
Mrs. Bertholt doesn't hold a burning passion for me.
I prosecuted her husband.
There are many people who think a death sentence... would not have been passed against Gen. Bertholt today.
I'm sure there are.
I'm sure there are people who think... all the prisoners in Nuremberg should be free today.
All of them. Let--
Excuse me.
I've had one or two too many... as might be painfully obvious to you gentlemen.
The spectacle this afternoon with Mr. Petersen put me off my feed. I'm sorry.
Three beers and Schwalbenwinkel, please.
Schwalbenwinkel.
It's good beer.
They make it good in this country.
You know, there's one thing about Americans.
We're not cut out to be occupiers.
We're new at it. 
We're not very good at it.
We come over here, and what do we see?
We see this beautiful country.
It is beautiful. 
It's very beautiful.
We see the culture that goes back for hundreds of years.
We see its gemütlich charm... and the charm of people like Mrs. Bertholt.
We've got a built-in inferiority complex.
We forgive and forget easy.
We give the other guy the benefit of the doubt.
That's the American way.
We beat the greatest war machine since Alexander the Great.
And now the boy scouts take over.
The trouble with you, Colonel, is you'd like to indict the whole country.
That might be emotionally satisfying to you... but it wouldn't be exactly practical, and hardly fair.
Hardly fair?
"Hare."
"Hunter."
"Field."
That's right, let's be fair.
"The hare was shot by the hunter in the field."
It's really quite simple.
Colonel, I think we ought to be going.
Yes, we really shouldn't be discussing this.
No, Judge.
We're fair Americans, and true-blue.
We mustn't do anything that's out of order.
No, sir. We can't do anything that's out of order.
There are no Nazis in Germany.
Didn't you know that, Judge?
The Eskimos invaded Germany and took over.
That's how all those terrible things happened.
It wasn't the fault of the Germans.
It was the fault of those damn Eskimos.
Excuse me.
- Good night, Colonel.
- Good night.
Can I have your attention, please?
I'm sorry to interrupt your dancing.
The following officers are requested to report to their units.
Maj. McCarthy, Maj. Citron,
Maj. Cantor, Capt. Byers...
Capt. Connell, Capt. Douglas, Capt. Wolfe...
Maj. Booth, and Maj. Rice.
Thank you. 
You can continue dancing.
Harry, what is it?
The Russians have made their move in Czechoslovakia.
It's rumored Masaryk committed suicide.
We're sending units up.
What do you think's going to happen?
I don't know.
Judge Haywood... 
Elsa Scheffler.
"President Truman responded to the crisis...
"by calling for an extension of military training.
"He stated that he is deeply concerned with the survival of the Western nations...
"in face of the threat from the East."
"Threat from the East."
Herr Janning, did you hear this?
Did you hear what's in the paper?
Exactly what Hitler said.
"The clash for survival between East and West."
He knew!
They'll see that we knew exactly what we were doing all the time.
They cannot call us criminals, and at the same time ask us to help them.
We must stand together now.
The most crucial part of this case is coming up.
We have fallen on happy times, 
Herr Hahn.
In old times it would have made your day if I'd deigned to say good morning to you.
Now that we are here in this place together... you feel obliged to tell me what to do with my life.
Herr Janning, you must stand with us.
It is not good for Germans to turn on one another.
We have a common ground now.
Listen to me, Herr Hahn.
There have been terrible things that have happened to me in my life.
But the worst thing that has ever happened... is to find myself in the company of men like you.
I have nothing in common with you and Party hacks like you.
You have something in common.
You were part of that same regime.
You stood by that regime, the same as the rest of us.
And there's something else you have in common.
You are a German.
Good evening. 
Did you like it?
Yes, I did. 
Very much indeed.
Can I drop you?
I only live a few blocks from here.
I was going to walk.
Would you like to go for a walk?
Yes, I would.
I won't need the car now.
I'll walk with Mrs. Bertholt.
- Shall I wait for you, Your Honor?
- That won't be necessary.
I'll wait for you, Your Honor.
The German people love to sing, no matter what the situation.
I've noticed that.
Do American people sing in bars, too?
I have forgotten.
No. We're apt to be pretty sullen in bars.
I wish you understood German.
The words are very beautiful.
Very sad.
Much sadder than the English words.
The German soldier knows he's going to lose his girl... and his life.
The lantern burns every night.
It knows the steps... and the way you walk.
It burns every night, but I've been long forgotten.
THE GOSPEL
ACCORDING TO MATTHEW
To the fond, happy, friendly memory of John XXIII
Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for she has conceived by the power of the Holy Ghost.
She wil I bear a son whom you will call Jesus, for he is to save his people from their sins.
The virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son and they shall call him Emmanuel, meaning God with us.
Where has the King of the Jews been born?
We have seen his star in the east, a nd have come to worship him.
Where will Christ be born?
At Bethlehem in Judea, the prophet wrote:
"And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judea
"art far from the least among the princes of Judea.
"For out of you will arise a leader
"who is to be the shepherd of my people Israel."
Seek the child, and when you have found him bring me word so I too may come and worship him.
Take the child and his mother, flee to Egypt and remain there until I give you word.
For Herod will soon search for the child, to destroy him.
I called my son out of Egypt.
A voice was heard in Ramah - the sound of wailing and great sorrow.
Rachel wept for her children, she would not be comforted, because they are no more.
Take the child and his mother and return to Israel, for those who sought the child's Iife are dead.
Repent, the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
He was the one the prophet Isaiah was referring to when he said:
"There is a voice of one crying in the wilderness.
"Prepare the way of the Lord,
"make his paths straight."
Brood of vipers! Who taught you to flee from the coming wrath?
Bring forth fruit that is worthy of your repentance.
Do not presume to say in your hearts:
"We have Abraham for our father."
God has power to raise up children to Abraham out of these very stones.
Already the axe has been put to the root of the trees, so that every tree that does not bear good fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire.
I am baptising you with water, for your repentance.
But one is to come after me who is mightier than I, so that I am not worthy even to carry his shoes for him.
He will baptise you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.
He holds his winnowing fan to sweep his threshing-floor clean.
He will gather the wheat into his barn but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.
It is I that ought to be baptised by you.
Do you come to me?
Let it be so for now, so that we may justly fulfil our religious duty.
This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.
If you are the Son of God, turn these stones into bread.
Man cannot live by bread alone but by all the words which proceed from the mouth of God.
If you are the Son of God, cast yourself down to earth. For it is written:
"He has charged angels to watch over you
"lest you should trip on a stone."
It is further written: "You shall not put the Lord your God to the proof."
I will give you all these, if you will fall down and worship me.
Away with you, Satan!
It is written: "You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve none but him."
The people who were dwelling in darkness have seen a great light.
For men living in a land where death overshadowed them, light has dawned.
Repent, the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
Peter.
Andrew.
Come and follow me,
I will make you fishers of men.
James and John, sons of Zebedee, come with me.
The harvest is plentiful, but the labourers are few.
Ask the Lord whose harvest it is to send labourers for the harvesting.
Peter.
Andrew.
James.
John.
Philip.
Thomas.
Simon.
Bartholomew.
Thaddaeus.
James, son of Alphaeus.
Matthew.
Judas Iscariot.
You shall be labourers for the harvesting.
I am sending you to be like sheep among wolves.
You must be wary as serpents, yet innocent as doves.
Be on your guard against men.
They'll hand you over to their courts and flog you in their synagogues.
On my account you will bear witness before governors, kings and Gentiles.
When you are given up into their hands do not fear what to say, because when the time comes, you will be given the right words.
It is not you who will be speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
You will be hated by all men because you bear my name.
Fear not those who kill the body but have no means of killing the soul.
Fear him more who has the power to ruin body and soul in hell.
Are not sparrows sold two for a penny?
Yet not one of them may fall to the ground without your Father's will.
Every hair of your head he takes into his reckoning.
Fear not, you count more than a host of sparrows.
Do not imagine I have come to bring peace to the earth.
I have come to bring a sword, not peace.
I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
A man's enemies will include members of his own family.
Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me, or anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
If you cling to your life, you will lose it, but if you give up your life for me, you will find it.
Lord, if you are willing, make me clean.
I am willing, be cleansed.
Tell no man, rather go and show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded as a testimony to them.
Blessed are the poor in spirit; the kingdom of heaven is theirs.
Blessed are those who mourn; they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the patient; they shall inherit the land.
Blessed are those who hunger for holiness; they shall have their fill.
Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
Blessed are the clean in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peace-makers, for they will be called the children of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, because the kingdom of heaven belongs to them.
Blessed are you, when men revile you and persecute you and speak all manner of evil against you falsely because of me.
Rejoice and be glad, a rich reward awaits you in heaven.
For that is how they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
If your son asked for bread, would you give him a stone?
If he asked for a fish, would you give him a serpent?
If you, evil as you are, know what is good for your children will not your Father in heaven give more good gifts to those who ask?
Do to other men all that you would have them do to you.
That is the Law and the prophets.
Do not think I have come to set aside the Law and the prophets.
I have come to bring them to perfection.
You are the salt of the earth, but if salt loses its flavour, how can it be made salty again?
It's no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.
You are the light of the world.
A city on a mountain top cannot be hidden.
A lamp is not placed under a bushel, it is put where it will light the house.
Do not lay up treasure on earth where moths and rust consume it and where thieves break in and steal it.
Instead, store up treasure for yourselves in heaven where there are no moths, no rust and no thieves to steal it.
A man cannot serve two masters.
He will hate one and love the other, devote himself to one, scorn the other.
You may serve God or money; you cannot serve both.
When you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your merciful deeds may be in secret.
Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.
You have heard it said:
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
I tell you, do not offer resistance.
If a man strikes you on your right cheek, turn the other.
You have heard it said: "Love your neighbour and hate your enemy."
I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you so that you may be true sons of your Father in heaven who makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, his rain fall on the just and on the unjust.
Do not judge others, or you yourselves will be judged.
For in the way you judge, you will be judged and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.
How is it you see the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and are not aware of the log in your own?
When you pray, don't use vain repetitions as the Gentiles do.
They think that by being so wordy they will be heard.
You are not to be like them.
Your Father knows well what your needs are before you ask him.
This, then, is to be your prayer...
Our Father in heaven,
Hallowed be your name.
Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
And forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Therefore I tell you, do not worry about everyday life, what you will eat or drink, or about your body, what you will wear.
Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?
Look at the birds of the air, they do not sow, or reap, or gather grain into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
Are you not more valuable than they are?
Indeed, which of you can make his life any longer by being anxious?
Why should you be anxious about clothing?
See how the lilies of the field grow, they don't work or make their clothing, and yet I tell you that even Solomon in all his glory was not dressed like one of these.
If God so clothes the grasses of the field, which live today and will be thrown into the fire tomorrow, will he not be much more ready to clothe you, men of little faith?
Do not fret then, asking what you will eat or drink or wear.
It is for the Gentiles to busy themselves over such things - you have a Father in heaven who knows that you need them all.
Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself.
Today's trouble is enough for today.
Make your way in by the narrow gate.
It is a broad gate and a wide road that leads to perdition and those who go that way are many indeed.
How small the gate, how narrow the road that leads to life and how few there are that find it.
Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
I give you praise that you have hidden this from the wise and revealed it to children.
Yes, Father, because this is what was pleasing to you.
My Father has entrusted everything into my hands.
No one knows the Son except the Father.
And no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened; I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon yourselves and learn from me.
I am gentle and humble of heart; you shall find rest for your souls.
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
Your disciples are doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath.
Have you never read what David did, when he and his followers hungered?
How he went into the tabernacle, and ate the loaves set out there although neither he nor anyone but the priest had the right to eat them?
Or have you not read in the Law that on the Sabbath, the priests on duty in the temple may work and yet remain innocent?
I tell you, there is one standing here who is greater than the temple.
If you'd understood the words,
"I desire mercy, not sacrifice", you would not have condemned the guiltless.
For the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath.
Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?
If one of your sheep fell into a pit would you not pull it out on a Sabbath?
What is a sheep compared to a man?
Mercy is not unlawful on the Sabbath.
Throw away your crutches.
Tell no man that you have been healed so that the word spoken by Isaiah may be fulfilled.
Behold my servant, my chosen, with whom my soul is well pleased.
I will lay my spirit on him, and he shall proclaim my rule among Gentiles.
He will not protest and cry out; none shall hear his voice in the streets.
He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smouldering wick until the time comes when he crowns his judgement with victory.
We must find a way to make away with him.
This is a remote place, and it is already getting late.
Send all these people to the village to buy food for themselves.
They don't need to go away.
You give them something to eat.
We have only five loaves and two fishes.
Bring them to me.
I am going to pray.
Take a boat and cross to the other side.
It's a ghost.
Take courage, it is I.
Do not be afraid.
Lord, if it is you, bid me to come to you over the water.
Come!
Lord, save me!
Why did you hesitate, man of little faith?
Is it his coming that was foretold or are we yet waiting for some other?
John has sent us to ask if it is your coming that was foretold.
Go and tell John what your own ears and eyes have witnessed.
How the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the poor have the Gospel preached to them.
Blessed is the man who does not lose confidence in me.
What did you go out into the desert to see?
A reed swayed by the wind?
If not, what did you go out to see?
A man dressed in fine clothes?
No, those who wear fine clothes are in kings' palaces.
So why then did you go out?
To see a prophet?
Yes, and something more than a prophet.
This is the man of whom it was written:
"I am sending before you that angel of mine who is to prepare the way."
God has raised up no greater son of woman than John the Baptist.
Yet to be least in the kingdom of heaven is to be greater than he.
Ever since John the Baptist's time the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and violent people have been seizing it.
All the prophets and the Law before John's time spoke only of things that were to come.
If you are willing to accept it, he is that Elijah whose coming was prophesied.
As for this generation, to what shall I compare it?
It is like children sitting in the marketplaces who call out to their companions,
"We played the flute for you, and you did not dance.
"We sang a dirge, and you did not mourn."
John would not eat or drink, and they say he is possessed.
The Son of Man came, ate and drank and they call him a glutton, friend of publicans and sinners.
But wisdom is proved right by her actions.
Woe to you, cities where I did miracles and you have not repented.
If Tyre and Sidon had witnessed such miracles as I have done in you, they would have repented in sackcloth and ashes long ago.
I tell you, Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgement day than you.
And you, Capernaum, do you hope to be lifted to heaven?
You shall fall low as hell.
Can this be the Son of David?
It is only through the power of
Beelzebub that he casts devils out.
He who is not with me, is against me.
And he who doesn't gather with me, scatters.
There is pardon for all the other sins and blasphemies of men, but not for blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.
Master, may we see a sign from you?
Wicked and unfaithful generation, the only sign that will be given is the sign of the prophet Jonah.
Jonah was three days and nights in the belly of the sea-beast.
The Son of Man will be three days and nights in the earth.
The men of Nineveh will condemn this generation on judgement day for they did penance to Jonah, and now one greater than Jonah is here.
The queen of the south will condemn this generation for she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom.
And, behold, one greater than Solomon is here.
Your mother and your brothers are outside, they want to speak to you.
When an evil spirit leaves a person it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none.
Then it says, "I will return to my house from which I came."
And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order.
So then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter in and live there and the last state of that person is worse than the first.
That is how it will be with this wicked generation.
Your mother and brothers are here.
Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?
Here are my mother and brothers!
If anyone does the will of my Father in heaven he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
How did he come by this wisdom, and these miraculous powers?
Isn't his mother Mary and his brothers James, Joseph,
Simon and Judas?
And his sisters live near us, don't they?
Where then did he get all these things?
Isn't he just the carpenter's son?
A prophet is not without honour, unless in his country and in his house.
Master, what shall I do to win eternal life?
Why do you ask me about what is good?
There is only one who is good.
If you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.
Which ones?
Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honour your father and mother, and love your neighbour as yourself.
All these I have kept.
What do I still lack?
If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven.
Then come, follow me.
Truly, I say to you, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Christ, bless our children.
Leave the Lord in peace.
Let the children be, do not keep them from me.
The kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.
Your dance has pleased me;
I will grant whatever you wish.
Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.
It is granted.
Let us withdraw into desert country, to be alone.
Follow me over to the other side.
Lord, give me leave to go home and bury my father.
Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their dead.
Master, I will follow you wherever you are going.
Foxes have holes and birds their nesting places.
The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.
Howl, O gate.
Cry, O city.
Thou, whole Palestine, art dissolved, for a smoke shall come from the north.
In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth.
On the tops of their houses, and in their streets e veryone shall weep abundantly.
Who do men say is the Son of Man?
So me say John the Baptist.
Others Elijah.
Others Jeremy.
Or one of the prophets.
What do you say that I a m?
You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
Blessed are you, Simon, son of John.
It is not flesh and blood, it is my Father that has revealed this to you.
And I tell you that you are Peter.
And it is upon this rock that I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
Whatever you imprison on earth
God will imprison in heaven.
And whatever you set free on earth shall be set free in heaven.
You are to tell no one that I am the Christ.
I must go up to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the chief priests, elders and scribes and then be put to death.
Never, Lord.
This shall never happen to you.
Back, Satan! For these thoughts of yours are men's, not God's.
If anyone wants to be my follower, let him renounce self, take up his cross, and follow me.
The Son of Man is to be given into the hands of men.
They will put him to death, and on the third day, he will rise again.
Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
Unless you become like little children again you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.
Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
And he who welcomes such a child, welcomes me.
But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea.
Woe to the world because it tempts people to sin.
Temptations are inevitable, but woe to the man who causes someone to sin.
If your hand or foot causes you to sin cut it off and cast it away from you.
Better to enter into life crippled or lame than to have hands and feet when you are cast into eternal fire.
What do you yourselves think?
If a man has a hundred sheep and one has strayed does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to look for the stray?
If, by good fortune, he finds it, he rejoices more over that one than over those that did not stray.
In the same way your Father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost.
Lord, if my brother commits an offence against me how many times must I forgive him?
Up to seven times?
No, not just seven times, but seventy times seven!
Now we are going up to Jerusalem.
The Son of Man will be given up into the hands of the chief priests and the scribes who will condemn him to death and then turn him over to the Gentiles to be flogged and crucified.
But on the third day he will rise again.
Go to the village ahead of you, and at once you will find a donkey tied there, with her colt by her.
Go and bring them to me.
If anyone asks say that the Lord needs them, and he will let you have them.
It is Jesus, Son of David.
It is written, "My house shall be called a house of prayer."
But you have turned it into a den of thieves.
Hosanna!
Hosanna to the Son of David!
- Do you hear what they are saying?
- Yes.
Have you never read the words:
"From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise"?
May you never bear fruit again.
How has it withered so quickly?
Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain,
"Be taken up and thrown into the sea", it will happen.
Every gift you ask for in prayer will be granted.
By what authority do you do these things?
Who gave you this authority?
I too have a question to ask.
If you can answer me
I will tell you what is my authority.
Did John's baptism come from heaven or from men?
If we tell him it was from heaven, he will ask:
"Then why did you not believe him?"
If we say from men, then we'll be mobbed because the people believe
John was a prophet.
We cannot tell.
Then I won't tell you by what authority
I do these things.
Tell me what you think: a man had two sons and he asked the first to work in his vineyard that day.
The son refused, but relented afterwards and went.
He asked his second son to work in the vineyard.
The son said he would go, but did not go.
Which of the two did his father's will?
The second.
Truly, I say to you the publicans and harlots are further on the road to God's kingdom than you because John came to you following all due observance, and you did not believe him.
The publicans believed him, and the harlots but even when you saw that you would not relent, and believe him.
Listen to another parable.
There was a landowner who planted a vineyard.
He walled it, dug a wine-press, and built a watchtower.
Then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went on a journey.
At harvest time he sent his servants to collect his share of the crop.
But the vine-growers grabbed his servants, they beat one, killed one, and stoned a third.
Then he sent more servants than the first time, and the vine-growers treated them the same way.
In the end he sent his son, thinking he would be respected.
But when the vine-growers saw the son, they said to each other,
"This is the heir.
Let's kill him and take his inheritance."
So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him.
Now when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those vine-growers?
He will bring those wretches to a wretched end and will rent out the vineyard to others who will pay him his due.
Have you never read in the scriptures:
"The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone -
"this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes"?
I tell you the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will exhibit the power of it.
When a man falls against the stone, he will break his bones.
When it falls on him, it will scatter him like chaff.
Many are called, but few are chosen.
Master, we know well that you are sincere and teach in all sincerity the ways of God.
You hold no one in awe, making no distinction between man and man.
Tell us, then, is it right to pay tribute to Caesar, or not?
Hypocrites, why test me thus?
Show me the coin used for paying the tax.
Whose likeness, whose name is inscribed on it?
Caesar.
Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.
Master, master...
Moses told us that if a man leaves no children when he dies, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother's name.
We had seven brothers in our country, of whom the first died a married man without issue, bequeathing his wife to the second.
He died, bequeathing her to the third and finally she had been every brother's wife, dying last of all.
When the dead rise again, which brother will be her husband?
You do not understand the scriptures, or what is the power of God.
When the dead rise again, there is no marrying or giving in marriage.
They are as the angels in heaven are.
Have you never read what God himself said of the resurrection?
I am the God of Abraham, of Jacob, and of Isaac.
Yet it is of living men, not dead men, that he is God.
Master, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?
Love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind.
This is the greatest of the commandments, and the first.
And the second is like it.
Love your neighbour as yourself.
The Law of Moses is interpreted by the scribes and the Pharisees.
Do what they tell you, observe what they tell you but do not imitate their actions, because they do not practise what they preach.
They tie up heavy loads that are hard to bear and put them on men's shoulders, but they're not willing to lift a finger to ease the burden.
Everything they do is done for men to see.
They make their headbands large and the tassels on their shawls long.
They love to sit at the head table at banquets and in the synagogue and respectful greetings in the market places, and they love being called Rabbi by men.
But don't you be called "Rabbi", because you have only one Master and you are all brothers.
And do not call anyone on earth your "father", for you have just one father and he is in heaven.
Nor are you to be called teachers; you have one teacher, the Christ.
The greatest of all is to be the servant of all.
The man who exalts himself will be humbled.
The man who humbles himself will be exalted.
Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites that shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in men's faces.
You will not enter, nor let others enter when they would.
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites.
You travel over land and sea to win a single convert and when he becomes one, you make him twice as worthy of damnation as yourselves.
Woe upon you, blind leaders, who say:
"If a man swears by the temple, it means nothing,
"but if he swears by the gold in the temple, his oath stands."
You blind fools!
Which is greater, the gold, or the temple that consecrates the gold?
And you say: "If a man swears by the altar, it means nothing,
"but if he swears by the gift on the altar, his oath stands."
Blind fools! Which is greater, the gift or the consecrating altar?
A man who swears by the altar swears by all that is on it.
He who swears by the temple, swears by him who has made it his dwelling.
The man who swears by heaven swears not only by God's throne, but by him who sits upon it.
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites because you have paid the tithe on one tenth of your mint, dill, and cumin but have neglected more important matters: justice, mercy and honour.
You should have done these things without neglecting the others.
You strain your water free of gnats while you gulp down a camel!
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites that scour clean the outside of a cup and dish but inside they are full of greed and excess.
You blind Pharisee!
First wash the inside of the cup and then the outside will become clean, too.
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites.
For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but on the inside are full of dead men's bones and every kind of impurity.
In the same way too, you outwardly appear righteous to men's eyes but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.
Woe upon you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites.
For you build tombs for the prophets and decorate monuments to the righteous.
You say: "If we had lived in our fathers' time
"we would not have murdered the prophets."
Thereby testifying that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
It is for you to complete your fathers' reckoning.
Brood of vipers, how are you to escape being condemned to hell?
And so, I am sending wise men and prophets to preach to you.
Some you will put to death and crucify, some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from city to city.
As a result, you will become answerable for spilling the blood of all just men from the blood of the just Abel to the blood of Zachariah whom you slew between the temple and the altar.
Believe me, this generation shall be held responsible for all of it.
O Jerusalem, still murdering prophets and stoning messengers sent to you.
How often have I been ready to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings and you refused it.
Look, your house is left to you, uninhabited.
You will not see me again until the time when you will say:
"Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord."
Do you see all these things?
There will not be a stone left on another, it will all be thrown down.
It is time for us to take Jesus...
...by some trick...
...and put him to death.
Not during the Passover festival otherwise a riot might occur among the people.
Why this waste?
It could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor.
Why are you bothering this woman?
She has done a beautiful thing for me.
You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.
When she poured ointment over my body it was to prepare me for burial.
I tell you the truth, wherever this Gospel is preached throughout the world, what she has done will also be told, in memory of her.
What will you pay me for handing him over to you?
Thirty pieces of silver.
I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me.
Lord, is it I?
Lord, is it I?
Lord, is it I?
Lord, is it I?
Lord, is it I?
The man who has put his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.
The Son of Man goes his way, as the scripture foretells but woe to the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed.
It would be better for that man if he had never been born.
Master, is it I?
Your own lips have said it.
Take, eat, this is my body.
Drink from it, all of you, for this is my blood of the new testament, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine again until I drink it with you, new wine, in the kingdom of my Father.
All of you will desert me tonight.
For it has been written:
"I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of his flock will be scattered."
But after I have risen, I will go on ahead of you into Galilee.
Even if everyone else deserts you,
I will never desert you.
This very night, before the cock crows, you will disown me three times.
Even if I have to die with you,
I will never disown you.
Sit down here, while I go and pray.
Peter, and you two, James and John, come with me.
My soul is ready to die with sorrow.
Stay here and watch with me.
My Father, if it is possible, let this cup be taken from me.
Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.
Didn't you have the strength to watch with me even for one hour?
Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation.
For the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, then may your will be done.
Put the sword back in its place!
For all those who take up the sword will perish by the sword!
Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?
You come to arrest me with swords and clubs, as if I were a robber.
Yet day after day I sat teaching in the temple and you never laid hands on me.
All this has taken place in order to fulfil the writings of the prophets.
Greetings, Rabbi.
Friend, do what you came to do.
He said: "I can destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days."
I also heard him say those things.
Have you no answer to make to these accusations?
I charge you under oath by the living God to tell us whether you are Christ, the Son of God.
Your own lips have said it.
I say to all of you you will see the Son of God again when he is seated at the right hand of God's power and coming on the clouds of heaven.
He has blasphemed!
Why do we need any more witnesses?
You have heard his blasphemy for yourselves.
What is your finding?
The penalty is death.
You also were with Jesus of Galilee.
I don't know what you're talking about.
This man was with
Jesus of Nazareth.
I don't know the man.
You must be one of them, your accent gives you away.
In the name of the living God,
I know nothing of the man.
He must die.
Give him up to Pontius Pilate.
I have sinned...
...in betraying innocent blood.
What is that to us?
It concerns you only.
It must not be put into the treasury; it's the price of blood.
We'll use it to buy the potter's field as a burial place for strangers, to be known as the Field of Blood.
Don't you hear the testimony against you?
It is the Passover today, and as with every Passover it's customary to release a prisoner...
...according to your choice.
Whom shall I release? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?
What wrong has he done?
Let him be crucified!
I am innocent of this man's blood.
See to it yourselves.
His blood is upon us, and upon our children!
Hail, King of the Jews!
Carry this cross!
You will be ever hearing, but never understanding.
You will be ever seeing, but never perceiving.
The heart of this people has become dull.
Their ears are slow to listen and they ha ve closed their eyes.
So they may never see with those eyes, and never hear with those ears.
My God, why have you forsaken me?
He's calling for Elijah.
Wait, let's see if Elijah comes to save him.
I know you have come to look for Jesus, who was crucified.
He is not here; he has risen, as he told you.
Go now and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and he is going ahead of you to Galilee; you will see him there.
All authority in heaven and earth has been given to me.
Go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptising them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost teaching them to obey all the commandments I have given you.
And remember, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.

Show him out!
- It will not take long, Regent.
How dare you!
Why did you come?
You have ordered the men to dig foundations for the new barn today.
It is not a good place, my lord.
Is that so? - Don't you remember what happened 5 years ago?
At that very place, your carman Daniel...
Fell into a pit dead drunk.
So?
- The pit wasn't there before.
I know this country.
And I know you, miller.
I wanted to...
...to have a clear conscience.
Your serfs seem quite bold, I dare say.
Regretfully, My Lord Bishop, that churl sits on a freehold farm.
You have lost all the same.
People say he is in consort with the devil.
When I was aspiring for the bishop's see, my competitor said the same about me.
Well! No ill feeling.
It doesn't seem to bother you.
Although it should!
- You have a parish priest.
Indeed!
A dimwit that believes in miracles.
You have gone too far, Regent.
You are talking about the spiritual shepherd of your subjects.
This man is their shepherd.
You can never burn him.
What do you mean by that?
Only the devil knows.
It all began almost a hundred years ago.
During the long wars with the Swedes.
My gamekeeper's great grandfather saw it all with his own eyes.
A mill stood on the same place as today.
Only its roof was thatched.
Back then, the miller's grandfather lived there.
Of the same miller you saw a short while ago.
After the Swedes had finally left, a mass for the miller's slain family was served.
And the place has been called the Burnt Mill ever since.
In short, whom fire leaves unharmed, dreads neither hell nor the Lord.
How came it?
Why didn't they burn in the fire?
- It was a miracle.
Light.
Light!
In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, our Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and in the hour of our death.
Amen.
Behold the handmaid of the Lord.
Be it done to me according to thy word.
Hail Mary, full of grace, our Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and in the hour of our death.
Amen.
Come to me.
Come.
Come, you silly.
Come, don't be afraid.
Let go. Let go!
The whole village is here.
Not to worry, they have other things on their mind.
Let go, Filip!
- Are my hands too cold?
Let go of me!
Who is it?
Come to the chapel tonight.
- I won't.
Will you come?
- No!
Quiet. Is something wrong?
We can stop if you wish.
- Jakub.
The fourth one.
- How comes?
It's the fourth bucket.
Go now! Next!
But it's the second one.
- Your buckets are twice as big.
The others have just the same.
You will come to work on Sunday.
- For a little water?
Be off, churl!
- You have no right to do that!
What right are you talking about?
The law doesn't impose corvee for water.
The miller told you that, didn't he?
Or did you read it?
Speak!
Help him!
Let him go!
Father...
Clemency behoves the suzerain.
And obedience the villein.
Go!
So you are the priest?
You are not quite how I imagined you.
His Excellency, the Bishop, made a certain promise regarding your...
He mentioned something about your...
- That is correct.
About me being of noble descent.
I beg your pardon.
I had no idea...
It is quite all right.
I truly hadn't the faintest idea, Monsignor Probus.
I am a mere chaplain here, Regent.
I have been informed of your troubles.
The bishop, however, certainly does not know what a disaster the Lord sent upon us.
As far as people remember, there has never been such a drought.
I have noticed.
Our well is the last one with water.
It has its advantages.
- I do not understand, Monsignor.
I am a chaplain, Regent.
And in a way, the drought is grist for the mill.
What's this supposed to mean?
I need someone dependable.
Praise the Lord!
Here's water for everyone!
That was a swell idea, son!
- And I don't even want you to drudge for me.
Come to the chapel tonight.
To the chapel? No.
Why not?
- Not there.
Back to work!
Back to work!
- Come to the lord's barn.
Back to work!
What did I tell you!
Get moving!
It counts for you too, doesn't it?
- What are you doing?
Don't you know how precious water is nowadays?
Is there any left?
Just a little, Father.
That's just what we needed.
I won't drink, Father.
It's good.
It should be, it's from the mill,
Father.
God bless you, son.
There's no need to frown.
A miller's shirt can hardly compete with a gamekeeper's coat.
And if she doesn't know, her parents will no doubt tell her.
She doesn't have any.
- That's even better.
In that case the suzerain will decide her matters.
We are here, Father.
A horrible abyss.
- People say, Father, that it is the gate to hell.
Give me a stone.
Be careful, Father.
There is no way forward or back for a living creature.
Is the mill far from here?
- It isn't, Father.
Come!
Welcome, Father.
I heard you coming.
I am getting to know my new parish and I would like to speak... with your father.
We are yeomen, Father.
Is your father here?
He's outside.
There's not much work in summer.
What a pity!
I wanted to take a look around.
I see you've heard our story.
I didn't come because of that.
I'm curious.
I hear water, yet I don't see it anywhere.
But it's dark there, Father.
Let's take the candle.
- Not this one!
This one is lit only when the miller passes away.
This is where it springs out.
And where does it go?
Nobody knows, Father.
Do you want me to turn on the millwheel?
There's is no need.
What's in here?
- A cellar.
Could I have a look?
Why are there so many candles everywhere?
We are the only mill where the water doesn't freeze.
And in winter, we grind flour overnight too.
I am glad
I could show you everything, Father.
Why?
- Because you may hear that the devil turns our millwheel.
We are lucky, Father.
Do you hear me, Father?
Father, the burnt miller!
The miller!
I'm curious to know what you are doing here.
Listen.
Halt!
Whoa, beasts!
Come on! Whoa!
Stop that witchcraft of yours, miller!
Idiot.
It sounded differently.
A hollow.
There must be more of them.
- That means...
That means...
Look.
Globeflower.
And it's growing on this dry land.
Why are you searching for water?
You have enough in your mill.
But the village has none, Father.
And our mill is too far.
That's very noble of you.
I've been searching all my life.
And learning as well.
Whether a rock yields water depends on the will of God.
Well, I'm not giving up hope.
You turn to the earth for help.
While l...
What's the matter?
What happened, Martina?
Did I hurt you in any way?
Say something.
I'm scared, Jan.
Martina...
I've heard strange things about your family again today.
About your father and...
- Martina, for God's sake!
It's nothing but old wives' tales.
You know who is spreading them and why.
- Shut your mouth!
I'm glad to see you admit it.
I've got nothing to say to you.
- But I've got plenty to say to you.
Let's go, Jan.
If you dare touch her one more time, you will have to deal with me.
You can't order me around!
And as far as she is concerned, others will decide about her.
Wait!
- Why such a hurry?
Get out of my way!
Why aren't you eating?
- I've always laughed at all the gossip, but last night, I started to care about what people say.
You will get used to it.
It's not me I'm worried about.
Is she afraid of us?
I don't mean just the silly tales.
This place really seems cursed.
Why don't you ever talk about it?
I don't.
- But why?
I am your son after all.
You will learn everything after I am gone.
From who?
Don't be so inquisitive.
I didn't ask you where you were all night, did l?
Lord, have mercy on us.
- Jesus Christ, have mercy on us.
Lord, have mercy on us.
Jesus Christ, hear our voices.

Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now and in the hour of our death.
Amen.

I will throw him into prison!
For what crime?
For finding water?
The court will deal with him.
- What can the court prove to him?
What? Anything. Interrupting a religious ceremony, for example.
Nonsense. The people came to him.
Being in consort with the devil then!
After all, that is within your competence, isn't it?
And can you or I for that matter say with certainty that he didn't find the spring out of God's will?
You will pay dearly for this, Jan.
Is the village feast today?
- A feast?
The miller gave water to the people, and the regent has to give them beer.
That boaster ordered to roll out five barrels on the threshing-floor.
The threshing-floor?
- Right there.
They told the people it's to celebrate the new barn.
Very clever of them indeed.
What have you got there? Show me.
The reverend is here.
- You are here too.
And the regent.
- And me.
I'm scared.
- I love you.
Jan...
The regent will never consent to it.
Let's get out of here.
Have you finished dancing?
- Leave us alone.
Do you want to spoil everything?
Wait for me here.
Suddenly, there's plenty of water.
And beer.
A solo!
- You can spare yourself the trouble!
Play!
You didn't get enough last time, did you?
Very well, I can add some more.
Get the catchpole!
Wait!
Let them be!
Put the knives away!
Throw the knife away.
And you all should listen!
You shouldn't be dancing here.
- How dare you?
Go back to your mill!
I'm the one who is paying for all this!
Don't forget that I've always given you good advice.
I'm the one who gives orders around here!
Dance.
Music!
Don't you hear?
Why are you standing here like idiots?!
Dance!
A step dance!
The feast was a smart idea indeed!
My carriage!
Get the miller.
You seem to forget I am a free man.
And you forget you are to blame for all those souls buried under!
I warned you all in time.
How could you know beforehand?
The earth talks.
Do you hear voices from the earth?
I don't understand.
You have just said so yourself.
All my life, I walk about and observe.
What has it got to do with the barn?
You built the barn on a site where snow hasn't lasted for many winters.
What does it mean?
Because heat has been rising from crevices up to the surface.
Heat? From frozen earth?
Down below the earth never freezes.
Do you know where the heat down below comes from?
Do you know the Bible?
I do.
And do you know what the Bible says about hellfire?
I am a good Christian, Father.
If you recall our first encounter, that is how I speak with the earth.
And it told me where to find water then.
And if you recall what I told you then,
I wish to add only this.
Only four-legged cattle walk with their heads lowered to the ground.
While a man created in the image of God
Iooks up to the heavens with confidence.
And there, he finds answers to everything.
But the earth gives us water and bread.
Bread and water are God's gifts that we beg from the Lord day by day.
You are a heretic.
Perhaps you do not know how perilous are the paths that have lead you astray.
You listen to the voices of nature.
The more insinuating they are the less your ears are able to hear the only voice you should listen to.
And who do you think urges you not to listen to the Lord?
I see you wish to object that you do good for the people.
But don't you know that the Devil lures people namely by what gives them pleasure?
Father, I am listening to you attentively.
Hold your tongue!
- However, in my conscience
I find no wrongdoing.
- What impenitence!
You have criminated yourself!
You are a wise man, miller.
I would feel great pity if you were to account for your deeds to the Holy lnquisition.
I will lend you a helping hand.
I expect to see you at my Sunday homily.
You may go now.
What's this supposed to mean!
Why did you let him go?
I've had enough of your ideas!
Why make such a fuss?
I'll throw him into prison!
And he will become a martyr.
The people will rid the Lord's garden of poisonous weed themselves.
Don't you understand?
After the procession and all that happened, he still may come.
The regent will never give his consent.
Hail Mary, full of grace...
Martina.
A this very place I am telling you that I will never give you up.
My father and me, we have a clear conscience. Nobody can harm us!
Martina?
Father...
Where did you find it?
I take my herd here to drink every morning.
But how did his hat get here?
Well, your father used to come here too.
Sometimes down here and other times up there.
What's up there?
He watched the pools down there, how the water keeps rising and dropping.
Green wreath of nine flowers woven, show me who my husband will be.
This is no evidence.
He hasn't been home for two nights.
He can't be alive.
- Now that's odd.
Particularly today when he was to come to the homily.
You knew, didn't you?
I didn't.
I reminded him to come and what happened?
His son came instead.
Do you mean to say he drowned in brook so shallow it hardly reaches one's toes?
Not in the brook, Father.
- In that case tell me the truth!
Where is he?
He either ran away or he is hiding.
You know the truth.
And you are lying through your teeth.
I don't understand at all.
You people from the mill when you do not want to, you do not understand at all.
Like father like son.
Father, for goodness' sake, what are you saying? - Go!
And don't come back unless remorse makes you fall on your knees and confess.
This way!
And there you will find an answer.
I shall now remove the blinders from your eyes and you shall see.
If your house or your house or your house burnt down, which one of you would walk out of the fire and ashes unharmed?
Which one of you would make water spring out of dry land when the Lord turned his face from us for so long?
Who made the earth open under your feet when you were rejoicing at your suzerain's kindness?
And whom am I missing on these sacred grounds despite urging him to come?
You, who are reading these words, are standing at a place...
...That has always protected us from war, plague, and even fire.
Safeguard this secret and search for a way out.
In front of you, you see three paths.
The first leads towards a light, yet it ends at the bottom of an abyss.
The second is the path of water and no one has ever reached its end.
The third, marked by a cross, is forbidden.
On this path, every step or mere sound of one's voice kills.
On the Friday before midsummer night when the barn sank into the ground, the water never being so low...
...As far as remembrance reaches. I set out to search for an exit on a raft.
Obeying the written word.
Obeying the written word.
Father.
Father!
Father!!!
Therefore, this man entangled in the net of dark powers dares not come and stand before the face of God.
I can see that in just wrath, you ask yourselves:
Where can we find the man you speak of?
And I ask you:
Where does a wild beast hide from hunters and their dogs?
Into its den. There you must go!
There you shall find him.
Let the hammer of your wrath strike the originator of evil there.
Should the hammer fail to strike in time, your souls shall forever be entangled in his nets, where in horrible suffering, they shall vainly seek redemption.
You must make haste!
Driven by the word of God, you must hurry to the mill and eradicate that den of evil!
And whatever you do above that, may you be aided the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
Amen.
My shoes!
If only you had told me what you wanted to do...
Until I have that old mole in my hand...
Everyone went home!
Until I get him on his knees,
I have nothing to explain.
Why are you standing there like that?!
You could have spared us the disgrace.
I'll get him!
My horse!
I guarantee you it!
Jan!
We've come to end it.
Where is your father?
Speak!
Don't go there, Father.
Miller!
Filip!
I warn you!
Go! Quick!
Shoot!
- Don't shoot!!!
Good Lord, Jan!
Jan...
Jan.

PART I: BLOSSOMS
March 1701
Every spring the Shogun sends greetings to the Emperor in Kyoto.
In reply the Emperor sends envoys to the Shogun's castle in Edo.
OKITSU
Quiet! Be quiet.
The envoys are leaving.
Show your respect.
We pray for your success.
We await your speedy return.
Such a strain having nobles here.
Yes, and no tips. A loss for us.
Imperial envoys. Too bad.
They're assigned to our inn.
Don't take it out on your clothes.
Fold them up.
Yes, yes. Too bad being an adopted son-in-law.
What's that?
Talking to myself.
Master of this inn, but without an heir I'm nothing.
Complaining?
Because I'm master of this inn great men talk to me...
I hear the latest news. I guess it depends how you look at it.
Master, a crowd wants the bath water the nobles used.
To drink?
No, to wash themselves.
They believe it prevents illness.
Give it to them.
And get me a masseur.
My shoulders are so sore.
People see nobles as gods, but in reality...
In reality they're broke.
Say, did you lend him money?
Look.
What's this?
For the loan I gave him.
A terrible hand.
EDO
Make way!
The Shogun's dog.
The August Dog is passing!
RESCUE STRAYS.
HARM TO DOGS PUNISHABLE BY DEATH.
You are the Shogun's favorite.
My gift may not be worthy of you.
It is small, but a rare one from a foreign land.
With this I feel I hold the power over the world in my hands.
I am glad it has found favor in your eyes, my lord.
The imperial envoys arrive soon.
All is ready to welcome them.
I can rest easy with you in charge, Kira.
Have Asano and Date sent greetings?
Yes, two bolts of silk from Date.
Dried bonito, I think, from Asano.
What? Asano is now in charge of
Reception. Only bonito from him?
But surely to you, as Grand Master of Ceremonies, he's been generous?
No, I've received nothing from him.
How strange.
A post like Reception is the key to a lord's success.
Yes.
It's how we recognize his ability.
Especially Asano.
His vast estates have grown; he's added salt farms. He's very rich.
Yes, yes, quite so.
You've also started salt farms?
Ours can't be compared with his.
So recently I sent most politely to request his help.
But he flatly refused.
Refused?
He said it was the former lord's secret formula.
So he couldn't tell even me.
And after I had sent gifts, too.
Now he needs you to help him.
Even the score.
He was free to refuse me, but it is my official duty to teach him.
There are many ways to teach.
Make sure he learns his lesson.
Time to go to the Castle, my lord.
At this hour?
Actually, I'm going to bring the Shogun here.
You see, he visits me sometimes.
For a reason.
Feast your eyes.
Truly delightful.
I've kept you waiting.
I'm on my way. What fun!
The Shogun loves both learning and ladies.
What he wants, he is determined to get.
Our ranks differ, but we are alike.
Without a desire for money and women, life has no value.
With lust and greed as my values,
I intend to live a long life.
Lord Yanagisawa even offered his own wife to the Shogun.
She agreed to it.
That is how he rose to his post.
Now there is nothing he cannot do.
Tomi, are you listening?
Please live a long and greedy life.
What?
Our son has been adopted by the mighty Uesugi Clan.
You have become
Grand Master of Ceremonies.
You are related to Lord Yanagisawa.
What more could you want?
I don't understand.
Why be satisfied with that?
I'm only getting started.
Pardon.
Tachu?
There was a messenger from Date.
Again?
And then one came from Asano.
Oh? What did he bring? Where is it?
Is this all the head of Reception sends me?
Tachu, Lord Date is only assisting
Lord Asano...
Yet he sends this fine Kaga silk...
Two boxes of a hundred gold pieces, and paintings by Shinyu Kano.
Asano is mocking me!
That's all I can think.
So it seems.
Tachu, when I sent you to ask about the salt farms...
We did our utmost – a European vase and two hundred gold pieces.
But he returned them.
And now, when he needs my advice, he sends one paltry roll of silk.
Chamberlain.
Gengoemon, you're so rushed.
I just heard that we sent Lord Kira much less than Date did.
Yes, I've heard.
Do something!
Fujii is with our lord about it.
A word, my lord.
Lord Date gave Kira...
Date has his way, I have mine.
But...
I don't like bribery. I hate it!
It's the cause of corruption in the government, isn't it?
As long as he teaches me...
I will honor Lord Kira, and treat him with due respect.
Thank you for your concern.
But I will do as I see fit.
Have you been here long?
A little while.
You always stop when you see me.
Tomorrow I must leave for Denso Mansion.
Until the envoys go back?
Yes, we must converse with them at night as well.
It's my duty and can't be helped.
A brief separation.
We can't even talk to each other.
Don't say such sad things.
Play the koto for me every day at this time.
I know I'll hear it wherever I am.
I will, with all my heart.
Please carry out your duty safely.
Yes. Kuranosuke wrote me a letter from home.
He too is concerned.
With his letter and your music,
I'll do well at my duties.
What? Asano's chronic illness has flared up?
He knew I was coming to inspect.
Yes, but suddenly...
Suddenly what? He didn't want to see me, so he is ill?
Of course not.
Can he carry out his duties?
I feel better.
Lady Asano's medicine helped.
Tell Lord Kira I will join him.
Lord Asano, no one can take your place in this important role.
Are you aware of that?
I had a sudden attack today.
That is no excuse.
To fall ill at such a time is a grave error. It is negligence.
Forgive me.
That was my official opinion.
But I am here unofficially today.
Take good care of yourself.
I feel better now.
Thanks to the medicine from your lovely wife?
Show me around then.
Everything seems in order.
A gorgeous screen by Yusho.
Worthy of your famous clan.
Yes, even I, Grand Master of Ceremonies, find no fault here.
I am unworthy of your praise.
Please tell me where I may be lacking in the future.
Very well, I will teach you some of what I know.
Yes, I humbly ask you.
In a position of this kind, gifts are of the utmost importance.
Head of Reception means head of gift-giving. Understand?
Answer me if you do.
Yes.
It is crucial to be generous to those you meet along the way.
The word will spread, you will be well liked, your duties will ease.
It's expensive, but it leads to success if you are careful.
The more generous you are, the better the results.
Understand?
What is this, Lord Asano?
Old mats in the room where you will receive imperial envoys?
Is this fulfilling your duties?
I have apprised you fully of all the requirements.
Old mats will not do!
But when I asked the other day, you said they needn't be changed.
I said that?
You are joking.
No. You said it.
An old man's memory slip?
Not in something so important.
Change them.
But there's no time to change five hundred mats now.
Still, I hear you are rich.
Maybe you can if you pay enough.
But there is a way not to have to waste so much money.
If you used your money wisely...
Understand?
Anyway, this won't do.
My lord, it sounds as if Kira will overlook the mats if we pay him.
But you know the Kemmu Code expressly forbids bribery.
It's supposed to stop corruption in the government.
Kira is easy to bribe, but my integrity won't allow it.
But in such an emergency...
Your lord is an obstinate man.
Indulge my pride.
My lord, please let me handle the changing of the mats.
Gengo, can it be done?
If our clan's honor is at stake.
You make it sound easy.
But five hundred mats by morning?
I'll do it if I have to enlist every matmaker in all Edo.
Gengo, thank you.
Pardon.
I am Takebayashi, vassal of Asano.
Are you matmakers?
No? I'm sorry.
We're matmakers.
Matmakers? Keep calm.
Refuse and you're dead.
Refuse what?
Oh, yes. Keep calm!
I am Takebayashi. My life depends on the favor I have to ask you.
I understand. But to send over all my hands on such short notice...
But I am Gengo Otaka humbling myself before you. I beg you.
I'm sorry, but your humility is none of my affair.
I see. It can't be helped.
I don't understand what...
What are you doing?
Committing harakiri.
What? Not here, please!
So, you'll help us?
This is unfair.
Our clan's honor is at stake.
We won't make it at this rate.
Too slow. Too slow!
Can't you do it faster?
What's happened to Yasubei Horibe?
He remembered another big matmaker and went for him.
Must be Otokichi. A drunk.
Yasubei the drinker going after a drunken matmaker.
Another round.
Another big one!
Nice cheery voice. And orders a big one instead of singles.
You understand drinkers.
Isn't that right, neighbor?
You seem like a strong drinker.
"Seem" is not the word.
A bottomless pit. Never full.
My kind of man.
And you?
Never lost a drinking match, so I never have to pay.
I like that. Shall we?
I'll have to make you pay.
A barrel of sake here.
Otokichi, at last I found you.
Horibe, you're just in time for our drinking match.
Not now, please. I need your help.
On my honor as a man of Edo,
I'll help after this match.
No, come with me now.
No you don't.
We're about to drink our way to fast friendship.
You can't take my drinking partner.
I'm very sorry, but...
Your name, sir!
I am Gemba Tawaraboshi, masterless samurai...
Teacher of the Hozoin lance.
Will you finish by dawn?
Please. Leave mats to matmakers.
But I'm worried.
Worry about Horibe. He took my place against a strong adversary.
Dawn already.
One more drinking spot.
I'm not done in yet.
I'll win. You can't get me drunk.
There must be some reason I can't.
Could be.
Hard work serving a lord.
But leave mats to matmakers.
We did it. All finished.
All done.
Did we do it?
Mats as far as the eye can see.
We did it. I'm so glad.
Please bear with the rest and complete your duties, my lord.
Yes. You have upheld our name.
I can't thank you enough.
Please instruct me...
Do I receive the envoys at the top...
Or at the bottom of the steps?
Are the envoys to be greeted at the top steps or the bottom?
Once more.
Do I receive the envoys at the...
Why are you asking this so late?
Forgive me. Please instruct me.
Do as you please.
You dislike receiving my advice.
I have no answer for you.
Lord Asano.
I am sorry for you.
Lord Wakisaka.
I heard. Listen.
Any mistake you make would reflect on Kira. He'll tell you.
Be calm and composed when he does.
Thank you.
Your duties end tomorrow.
Until then close your eyes, stop up your ears and play dumb.
Play dumb?
The smallest upset could make your vassals homeless.
Please be cautious, Lord Asano.
Lord Asano, wrong place.
Get to your place!
Quickly! Facing Lord Date.
MARCH 14. THE SHOGUN ENTERTAINS
THE ENVOYS WITH A NOH PLAY.
Oh, I'm so sleepy.
What if we doze off at the play?
Then I'll do this.
An hour till the ceremony.
Please take your ease.
You understand?
You're late, Lord Asano.
I'm sorry.
I've studied this.
Lord Date, are the elders' instructions clear to you?
Make no mistakes.
Lord Kira, may I see that?
Lord Kira!
Since you don't like instructions,
Lord Asano, you needn't see it.
Then I cannot carry out my duties.
Please let me see it.
If I fail, I will be punished.
Unless I see the instructions,
I won't know...
Lord Kira!
Lord Asano.
It wasn't instructions.
It was only fire warnings and such.
But Lord Date...
Lord Kira is just being unpleasant.
Yes, unpleasant. Why only to me, day after day?
Come, it's almost time to meet the envoys.
One moment, Lord Date.
Lord Kira.
Lord Asano.
Lady Keishoin wishes to thank the envoys.
Please inform me when the ceremony ends.
Most certainly.
Oh, if you have a request, please ask me.
He knows nothing.
Lord Kira!
What do you want?
Please show me the instructions.
How tiresome. I said no.
Why not?
What a face. You'll be late meeting the envoys.
What are you doing? Let go!
Asano!
Watch yourself.
This is the Shogun's Castle.
Draw your sword here and your clan is doomed. You know that?
What...what are you doing?
Apologizing? Then I'll listen.
I lost my temper. I was rude.
Please forgive me.
You admit you acted like a country lord, you backwoods baron!
You don't like being called that?
You're ignorant, yet you scowl.
I can't stand the sight of you!
Kira, you...
Have mercy!
Remember where you are!
One more stab!
You're inside the Castle.
Your clan will be ruined. Calm down!
Lord Asano drew his sword!
A doctor! Lord Kira is injured!
Wretch!
Defiling my crest with blood!
I beg...I beg your pardon.
Closer!
Where are the envoys?
Luckily, they didn't hear.
I see.
Everything went as planned.
But the Elders are meeting now.
Why? The rules are clear.
Keep to the rules!
Calm down. Calm down!
The trouble is between Lord Kira and Lord Asano. No one else.
We are to investigate the motives behind this incident.
I will now question you formally.
When you wounded Lord Kira you were of course mentally deranged?
No, I was not.
If you were, you will be absolved of any crime.
You were deranged, were you not?
Not at all.
I regret with all my heart that I drew my sword in the Castle.
Please punish me.
You must have had a reason, and a wish to explain.
Do not hesitate to tell us.
I forbid him to explain.
Why? For what reason?
We did not come to hear excuses.
But, Lord Kondo...
If he was not mentally deranged, he is a criminal.
Our responsibility ends there.
Lord Asano...
I am sorry. Sorry only that Kira escaped.
Sister!
I have just heard.
How could he do such a thing?
The Asano Clan is doomed.
As his brother, I'll suffer too.
Our parents back in Hiroshima, and your parents too...
Up until this moment, I was happy.
But what my brother has done makes me bitter.
Lord Daigaku, will Lord Kira live?
I don't know.
What will they do to Lord Asano?
I have heard nothing yet.
I must know as soon as possible.
Lord Daigaku, have pity.
Pardon.
A messenger reports that our lord is in Lord Tamura's custody.
Lord Date.
You must feel relieved that your duties are over.
Yes, but I am disturbed over that unexpected incident.
Have you heard about Kira?
No, not yet.
They let him go home without a reprimand, to see to his wounds.
Lord Date, do you think it's fair?
I do not.
What about Lord Asano?
He wasn't allowed a word in his own defense.
They turned him over to Lord Tamura with orders to commit harakiri.
Late cherry blossoms, Lord Asano.
Especially lovely when they fall.
Soon the moon will rise.
Farewell on such a spring evening must be painful.
Isn't it, Lord Asano?
Tell me if you have any messages for your clan at home.
I have nothing to say.
But my people will wonder when they hear of this day.
Enough talk. All is prepared.
"Sadder than blossoms swept off by the wind...
"A life torn away in the fullness of spring."
I'm afraid. So afraid.
But the injury is so slight.
Fortunately.
But he is of advanced age.
Anything could happen.
Hyobu, I married into the Uesugi family.
But I will risk my new riches to save my father.
Let me be a dutiful son no matter what happens.
Tsunanori. Tsunanori!
Help me.
I haven't had my fill of wealth or women yet.
And, thankfully, no one has censured me.
I want to live much longer.
I'll do anything for it.
If I'm called a coward,
I'm proud to be one.
Help me. Help me.
I'm counting on you.
MARCH 15, 1701
COURIERS SPEED FROM EDO TO
LORD ASANO'S CASTLE
They're coming!
MARCH 16
MARCH 17
MARCH 18
Osei! Osei!
Take care of her! I am Sampei
Kayano of Lord Asano's clan.
We are on an emergency errand.
Forgive us! Forgive us!
THE ASANO CLAN CASTLE IN AKO
Father.
Everyone here?
How is the town?
Very quiet.
Wondering whether you will fight or surrender the castle.
We must decide that now.
I had hoped to live out my days uneventfully...
A useless soldier in peacetime.
Quiet, please!
The time for debate is over.
Let me sum up the arguments.
The choice is either to fight or to try to rebuild our clan.
That has been decided.
Oh? Which?
Our lives belong to our late lord.
We can't surrender the castle.
We've decided to die fighting.
You agree to that?
Of course.
All agreed?
Anyone with other ideas, step out.
No one?
Okano.
We are ready to die.
But has Kira died of the wound our lord inflicted?
If so, we have no excuse for anger.
Your ideas would change too.
Is he dead, Chamberlain Ono?
No, I think it's only a rumor.
Have you become reluctant to die?
What? I am Kurobei Ono, samurai.
I have given my word.
I would like your advice.
Yes, ask me.
The problem is...
I am responsible for the treasury.
We still have about 7,000 gold pieces left.
But our clan has issued 12,000 gold pieces in paper currency.
We are 5,000 short.
But we have given loans, and there is money we have not collected yet.
If we collect, we will cover it.
I'm relieved to hear that.
It doesn't matter to us, since we are going to fight and die.
But our paper money is used by merchants, fishermen and farmers.
It will disgrace our dead lord if we don't redeem it.
Quite true.
I would like permission to collect loans and taxes.
I want to do this before we fight.
Yes. Please hurry.
Lord Wakisaka is on his way to
Takatori Pass with 3,000 men.
He will take over our castle.
Please redeem the currency before that happens.
THE ARMY OF LORD WAKISAKA
Say, girls.
A real bargain.
Who cares? I'm clearing out.
Me too. Armies are coming from all over to surround Ako.
You should run too!
I believe only those loyal to our clan are here.
I wish to tell you my intentions.
Isn't our plan clear already?
Don't we die defending the castle?
My thinking has changed somewhat.
It's easy enough to die fighting.
But we have a larger responsibility as vassals of Asano.
What?
What happened was our lord's fault.
So our task is to restore the Asano Clan.
We must entreat the Shogun to let
Lord Daigaku succeed our lord.
I believe this must be our course of action. Do you all agree?
No. That would be a betrayal of our loyalty.
Chamberlain.
Remember our lord's last words?
He said his people would wonder when they heard of his death.
Why should we bow to injustice?
I understand. But I won't change my mind.
Isn't that Kazuemon Fuwa?
Kazuemon!
Kazuemon Fuwa!
Terrible, isn't it?
We've just returned from Edo.
Then you haven't heard they're going to die defending the castle?
It's been decided?
I'm just a masterless samurai now.
But I rushed over to defend the walls, at least, for my dead lord.
Look. I'm poor, but I still have my armor, and my lance isn't rusty.
How dare Ono run off with the clan treasury!
I suspected him, but chose to hope.
I was too trusting.
From now on I'll doubt everyone.
Emoshichi Yato is outside and wishes to see you.
I can't.
I told him that.
Give my regards and send him away.
What about the paper money?
The farmers have let us redeem it at only 60% of face value.
Many of them are more loyal than samurai.
Anything left for vassals?
If we don't fight we can divide our reserve of war funds.
Still here?
He won't leave till he sees you.
The chamberlain is busy, so tell me what you want.
I am Emoshichi, son of Chosuke, the bookkeeper.
Father is ill.
He is unable to present himself to show his loyalty. He suffers.
So, inexperienced as I am,
I came to take his place.
I understand. But you are not of age.
Stay home and be a good son.
Father's rank is low. Is that why?
No, it isn't.
But Matsunojo's under age.
He is Chamberlain Oishi's son.
Loyalty is loyalty, chamberlain's son or bookkeeper's.
I should have been born a chamberlain's son too.
With so many opinions we can't resolve this.
So if you are throwing in your lot with me...
Sign your name in blood.
Proceed regardless of your rank.
Oishi says they'll surrender, but they're reinforcing the castle.
So it's war?
We are surrendering, but we must repair unsightly damage.
Only 61signatures.
It's a hard thing to ask.
In desperate times, it's every man for himself.
Oishi got men to sign in blood.
What for? He's surrendering.
Maybe to calm the hot-heads.
It may be a trick. Go back to Edo and report to Chamberlain Chisaka.
Traitors!
Lord Uesugi's spies. That's who spread rumors of Kira's death.
Now we know Kira is still alive.
How?
Hyobu Chisaka is Lord Uesugi's famous chamberlain.
He's spying to see if we seek revenge.
Horibe, don't tell this to anyone.
Keep it your secret.
Hurry to Edo. Find out what Kira and Lord Uesugi are up to.
Yes, without fail.
LORD WAKISAKA'S CAMP
I think Ako will fight.
I can't believe they'll surrender tomorrow.
Please look.
Seems to be more than paper.
Paper holds the castle's history.
Vast amounts of paper.
Now I can surrender it with an easy mind.
I am Chamberlain Kuranosuke Oishi.
I respectfully surrender the castle.
I am Lord Wakisaka, appointed to take charge.
I will guide you, my lord.
I've heard you're a very able man.
The care you have taken in handing over this castle impresses me.
I was prepared for battle.
But it enhances my reputation to be able to avoid it.
I owe it to you.
You are kind.
But you must have a reason for handing it over so readily.
Tell me. I'll keep your secret.
There is none.
Those were my orders.
A battle might have spilled innocent blood.
Please, tell me your real intent.
I was your lord's friend in Edo.
I know that from his letters.
Lord Asano broke the Shogun's rules but he upheld the samurai code.
He risked his clan to stop corruption.
Please don't speak of that.
My late lord was responsible for what happened.
As his vassals, we plan to appeal to the Shogun to restore his clan.
We have sworn our allegiance.
Please help us by adding your entreaty to ours.
A vassal's way to repay his lord?
Yes.
Truly?
My lord left a last poem.
"Sadder than blossoms swept off by the wind...
"A life torn away in the fullness of spring."
Was he sad to die young, or is his poem about his resentment?
No, it shows his deep concern for his vassals.
I'm sorry.
They surrendered the castle to set up Lord Daigaku.
What about Oishi?
He's moved to Yamashina.
Thank you.
Go soon and check up on Oishi.
Restoring the clan?
Do you believe that, Ikkaku?
Revenge.
Yes, the real reason Oishi gave up the castle was to get Kira's head.
I'm glad to see you well, my lord.
Yes, I hope to live to a hundred.
The reason I studied to become
Grand Master of Ceremonies...
Was to avoid the samurai duty to die at the slightest provocation.
Samurai all look very stupid to me.
I too am a samurai.
Well, there are different kinds of samurai.
I depend on you, Hyobu, to protect me from Asano's stupid samurai.
My lord has ordered me to do so.
My son, who is now heir to the Uesugi clan, is very loyal to me.
But my wife is a heartless woman.
Afraid I'd be criticized, she went back to her parents.
And left me all alone.
Hyobu, I'm counting on you.
I'm afraid. You must help me!
How was that?
It's called "Tossing up bales."
What's in the bales?
Dirt. Heavier than rice.
So how much will Lord Uesugi pay for me?
OISHI'S HOME IN YAMASHINA
Kichiemon!
Mother! Kichiemon Terasaka's here.
You're a big boy now.
I'm very glad you've come.
We have few visitors since moving here; the children miss company.
I'm sorry. I meant to come sooner.
I came today because it's the anniversary of Lord Asano's death.
You're very kind.
How time flies. A year has passed.
Yes. I'm used to a hard life, but it must be difficult for you.
Be my horse! Hurry!
Yes, yes. Out at the gate.
I'll be waiting.
Where is Chamberlain Oishi?
It's odd, but he's been staying in the tea houses.
He hasn't been home for some time.
Has he forgotten what day this is?
No, he told me to offer flowers and cakes to our late lord today.
Matsunojo, copying his father, has gone fishing today.
Fishing on our lord's anniversary?
They are both alike.
Which tea house?
In Fushimi, Shumoku-cho.
Is it Sasaya?
My sister is working there.
What? Okaru?
Okaru!
Sampei!
You're late.
I came as fast as I could.
This work is so hard.
Haven't seen each other for 3 days.
I missed you.
Is your work so hard?
I forget it all when I'm with you.
Forgive me, Okaru.
If it weren't for that incident, we'd be married.
My samurai duty prevents it now.
Why were you born a samurai?
Why?
What fun. You are quite a fellow.
Your praise overwhelms me.
You're no commoner, are you?
"I have soiled my lofty name and besmirched my family fame..."
Be serious. What happened to others may happen to you.
Scolding me? Insolent fellow.
Catch him and make him drink.
A punishment I welcome.
I'll gladly drink it.
I've been assigned to your room.
My name is Okaru.
Uki seems tired. Please lay out his bed so that he may sleep.
Are you the courtesan Ukigumo?
Then may I see Chamberlain Oishi?
Wrong room?
Chamberlain Oishi?
My name is Kiken Murakami.
No, no. I'm Kyuemon Ikeda.
You've got the wrong man.
Here you are. This is my room.
He's the one who made the mistake.
Wait! An assumed name.
I know who you are.
You women. We must talk. Get out.
You too.
Oh, no. She's my special one.
Forgive me. Let's go.
Oishi...no, Ikeda. Do you realize today is Lord Asano's death day?
Let's see...
Don't pretend!
Even we outsiders know this day.
How can you fondle women and drink?
Scolded for drinking with my own money.
Your own money? Be quiet!
You borrowed 600 ryo from Lady
Asano when you gave up the castle.
Steward Ochiai told me.
Was it for this purpose?
Tricking the enemy is noble, but you go too far in this debauchery.
How can you succeed like this?
Tell me how you really feel.
Samurai from everywhere are looking to you.
Please tell me your real thoughts.
You!
No violence. You will be ridiculed.
He's not what I'd heard.
Has money corrupted him so badly?
I have no more illusions.
Has he left?
Pretending to sleep?
I hate self-righteous men.
I love brothels.
His name means "Great Stone," but he's less than a pebble.
A cowardly samurai.
I've been here five days.
He's still away.
They say a man who strays in old age is harder to cure.
Please stop. Let Father alone.
I'm sorry.
But your brother and sisters are so young. I feel sorry for them.
Be my horse!
All right, a bucking horse.
Sampei Kayano?
Yes.
No mistake?
You killed an old woman last year.
Are you Saburoji Kaiga?
Yes, I've been looking for you.
I found your offering for Mother.
Think that's compensation?
Draw! I will avenge my mother.
Your sedan killed her.
Wait!
Wait, wait!
Are you going to kill me too now?
Where are the children?
Gone walking with Kichiemon.
His coming is a great help.
I'm too tired to play with them.
You're away so much, they miss you.
Riku, I seem to have become this
Kyuemon Ikeda person lately.
Sampei? What a nice surprise.
Come in.
I have a favor to ask.
My samurai honor requires that I die.
I see.
Our lord had to commit harakiri for his samurai pride.
Now you will die for samurai honor?
I must, but I signed my name in blood to join you.
Please take my name off the list.
I understand.
One more favor.
Since I must die, please tell me your real intentions.
Real intentions?
Yes, your real intentions.
My dissolute life is to deceive the shogunate.
We can prove our loyalty only by restoring the Asano Clan.
You know I'm going to my death, will you still lie to me?
Our lord, goaded beyond endurance, knowingly sacrificed his clan.
They made him die like a criminal.
I believe in you, Chamberlain.
I'm going to die.
Please tell me the truth!
Sampei, I have formed the habit of doubting people.
I couldn't make up my mind.
Up till this moment I have wavered.
But your words have decided me.
Then...?
I will defy the shogunate.
Chamberlain!
You have my word.
Saburoji? Come in, it's open.
You brought seconds?
That wasn't necessary.
Sampei! It's time. Come out!
You're it. Come to the clapping.
I caught you!
Hara and Onodera? Did you pay my bill here for me?
Yes.
I see. Then let's drink.
The money man's here.
He'll buy you whatever you want.
Sampei Kayano committed harakiri.
I see.
What's wrong?
Nothing. I just heard that my pet sparrow died.
Sparrow?
Oh, yes.
Let's hold a wake for it tonight.
I'll be the chief abbot.
You play the samisen and pray.
"This then I cannot miss...
"We'll borrow these like this...
"And have her hold this so...
"With a finger thus, you know...
"And now, how is this sparrow?
"Very good, so very good...
"And now it is the Abbot's turn...
"For the sparrow of Kayano he'll incense burn...
"Guiding him among the dark souls below...
"O Merciful Buddha, on him blessings bestow...
"Very good, so very good."
Uki's crying. Uki's crying!
You caught me? My tears...look, they're this.
Let's hold the sparrow's wake.
Cry, all of you, cry. Cry!
The Shogun has banished
Lord Daigaku to Hiroshima for life.
We must hurry. Kira's rank is high, but his holdings small.
But the great Uesugi Clan is behind him.
If we 61 who signed the pact are united, we have nothing to fear.
Revenge is easy.
Finding the right way is hard.
Go to Edo at once and inform our people there.
I will organize around Kyoto.
But be very careful.
Our purpose is not just beheading Kira.
As samurai be ready to sacrifice yourselves for your honor.
Kira's spy?
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.
SAMPEI KAYANO, d. APRIL 11, 1702
What a fine, fresh day.
Sampei loved these flowers.
He did? Then he must be glad.
But can he see them?
Of course he can.
The living see only what's in front of them; the dead see all.
Is it true, Sampei?
Okaru, when I go to Edo with the Chamberlain, you'll be all alone.
What will you do?
We knew that from the first, didn't we? I'm prepared.
Don't be rash.
Sampei used to beg me...
To live as long as I could, and take care of his grave.
I guess we won't meet again?
I've spent all my money.
I'll have to sell my house.
The end of a dissolute life.
Don't tell anyone for a while.
I understand.
I'm divorcing my wife.
So she can take the children to her home and escape my reputation.
Your poor family.
We're off to Tajima.
Goodbye.
Take care.
It's hard to leave even this house, since it's become home.
Yes, I'm leaving it soon myself.
We'll be going then.
Please take care of yourself.
Do you think I'm cruel, Matsunojo?
I've told your mother nothing.
I trust her, but I feel a couple needs no words.
As your wife, she must understand.
But even so, I think she would have liked you to tell her.
Her heart must be heavy now.
But she left without complaint.
She didn't cry, though she must have wanted to.
She'll probably cry her heart out back home.
No. Mother will never cry as long as she lives.
Right. Your mother is gentle, but strong.
Would you like to follow her?
Why?
I'm asking if you're ready to die.
I joined of my own free will.
I want justice, not fame or luxury.
There's only one road for me!
END OF PART I: BLOSSOMS
PART II: SNOW
I saw it all. The bridge collapsed.
It happened so suddenly.
The men were forced laborers.
A lot died. Hard luck.
Anyway, that stone is for
Lord Yanagisawa.
And then?
I don't know.
Get back!
That lance teacher?
Yes. I'm from Edo too.
We worked all night, and Lord Asano rewarded us well.
I've heard that a hundred times.
The point is all Edo's on his side.
Yes, me too.
But that Tawaraboshi is becoming
Kira's bodyguard for money.
Say what you want to say.
Speak up if you're angry!
Talking behind my back.
We weren't.
Then I'll shut up.
A person can't say anything any more.
Hello.
It's been a long time.
In service to a new lord, I hear.
Look at me. If I were,
I'd pay my bill here.
Wouldn't I?
Not yet?
Matsudaira, Nakagawa, Uesugi and Kira have all asked me...
But won't pay enough.
I'm proud of my good right arm.
I'll wait till it's appreciated.
Trusted my arm, they said.
Quit joking. An Edo carpenter, aren't you?
Are you serious?
Building Kira's house, of all places?
Serious? It's half finished.
You amaze me.
Now, listen.
Anyone home? Fresh rice.
Here's your rice.
Thank you.
Tired?
I'll make tea. Wait.
"This was Lord Kondo's house, and your father built it."
When I heard that I was speechless.
A tradesman's easy. Tell him he's good, he forgets it's Kira's house.
And so I said I'd build it.
But Father was a famous carpenter, wasn't he?
He was.
I want to see who's better.
So it doesn't matter to me that it's Kira's house.
That's your excuse?
Well, I... Look.
This is Father's blueprint.
Leaving?
Yes.
Want to go for an evening walk sometime?
Me?
Yes, if you'd like to.
Please don't.
I won't do anything. I won't.
Just this.
Just doing this will give me a long life.
I've brought new bodyguards.
Please look at them.
Handayu Waku.
Heihachiro Kobayashi.
Never mind. I can't remember names.
I am old.
I'm counting on you to protect me.
Ikkaku.
Is the master lancer you mentioned among them?
No, Tawaraboshi couldn't...
What? If it's money, ask Lord Uesugi.
What, fifty bodyguards?
Yes. Tachu says he'll increase the number to 200.
Does he have that much power?
Since Chisaka fell ill, he's become a chamberlain. He's in control now.
200 is a big job.
Thank you. It must be unpleasant, but please help us.
Your brother's coming with the Chamberlain soon.
A woman cannot do battle, so I wish to be of use this way.
At his new mansion in Honjo...
A carpenter has been told to build secret passages and hiding places.
Okano's trying to get the plans.
Kujuro, were you a samurai?
Yes, but I hated it from childhood.
Always duty, loyalty...
I wanted freedom, so I became a commoner.
What about your parents?
They gave up and told me to marry and do as I please.
Found a nice bride?
Yes.
Really?
I haven't asked her, but my mind's made up.
Good, isn't it, that you found a nice girl?
Yes.
I'd like to meet her.
You can, any time.
No, I don't want to!
Shall we go home?
What sort of girl do you like?
Like you.
Liar.
Tell me the truth.
It's true. I love you.
It's true. I want you for my wife.
You're both in love with my sister.
But you've got a nerve asking me to choose between you.
I told you so. You said to try.
So we tried and failed.
I'll say!
What are you complaining about?
Otsuya? Come here.
You've been with the rice man?
Oh, you knew?
They told me. They say you're in love with him.
What a face. Didn't I promise you could make your own choice?
Come say what you want outright.
We've promised to get married.
Well, well. I envy you.
Don't!
Please be nice to Kujuro.
Saying it with your back to me?
So you've done it.
What?
It means I'd better not waste any time either.
What's wrong, Okano?
I've never been so miserable.
It's for the sake of justice.
Deceiving an innocent girl.
You didn't really fall for her, did you?
It'll be worse if you did.
Either way, I'm jealous.
Why don't girls ever fall for me?
But you're the only man
I've ever loved.
When I found you, I gave up drinking and gambling.
I won't let you go. Ever!
I'll earn money, buy my freedom, and we'll get your master to agree.
Yes. We'll work hard and make a home.
Listen.
I'm not respectable.
But you'll take me?
I can't count the number of men
I've known. I told you, didn't I?
Don't leave me!
Know what I prayed for?
Kira's palanquin!
Now's our chance. Hurry!
Too many. Going to Yanagisawa's about that fire. Smart old fox.
What about our men?
Many are running out of patience.
I've seen to that.
You got carried away, but remember that we're all in this together.
We're not just after Kira's head.
You should know that!
Do not act on impulse.
Are you safe? There are many of Asano's men in Edo.
I had to come when I heard that a fire had struck your home.
No, no, it's made me richer.
Something shining under the gifts of condolence?
The elders and lords all sent me trees and rare garden stones.
I don't know why.
Like some? Is your new home done?
Oh, it's you.
Look, lend me the plans a few days.
What for?
Kujuro wants to borrow it.
Why would a rice shop man want it?
To boast that I'm the sister of the man who built this fine house.
I see. For my dear sister's sake.
You will? Thank you.
Yes, of course. That's what
I'd like to say, but I can't.
Carpenters never show blueprints to anyone.
It's a promise sealed in blood.
So it's no.
But...
No!
I said no.
Are you really in love with him?
What about him? Is he serious?
He's a samurai's son?
Wants his parents to see
I'm an important carpenter?
So they won't look down on you?
Then I'll lend you my Komyoji
Temple blueprint. That's my...
No, Kira's mansion.
Say, he's a samurai's son?
And he only wants the Kira blueprint?
Say, does he really love you?
Does he?
Or does he just want those plans?
No, no. He's not that sort!
Think I'll go listen to a street storyteller.
Anyway, you can't have the plans.
Tawaraboshi's becoming
Kira's bodyguard? Not likely.
Can't tell. Uesugi's paying.
He's proud of his skill.
Money may move him.
If he is Kira's bodyguard, we'll have to get rid of him fast.
Will you do it, Horibe?
Kujuro!
A lovely visitor.
Kujuro.
I brought the plans.
Thanks. I'll get leave to go home tomorrow, and be back in three days.
I struggled to get it for you.
So please be back in three days.
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.
You know I'm Tawaraboshi?
Alone, Yasubei?
I know you. That mask's no good.
I expected 5 or 6 men.
But then I might have had to die.
Is that why you came alone?
You've fallen into my trap.
What trap?
I'm not working for Uesugi.
But I knew the rumor would bring you to my school to fight.
Or to get me drunk and kill me.
You came, as I thought.
And now I know what I wanted to know.
Don't talk nonsense.
I attacked you for criticizing the Asano men.
Is that right? I don't think so.
Yasubei, when is it?
When is what?
Oh, that's right. You can't talk.
But I think of you as a friend.
So if you take a long trip, or a new lord, stop by my school.
We'll have a farewell drink.
Yasubei!
Don't be suspicious of me.
Welcome.
Steward Obana will stay the night.
Show every respect.
Forgive me. Your arrival was not expected. We will make ready.
IMPERIAL ENVOY: MITSUTADA OBANA
Thank you for staying with us.
My journey is on behalf of
Prince Seikanji.
We are taking his offerings to Zojoji Temple.
I see. The Prince stayed at this inn last spring.
Remember, when Lord Asano drew his sword in the Castle.
Yes, of course.
Were you accompanying him then?
You were? I'm the son-in-law here.
Sorry I was too busy to see to you.
I have the list of offerings.
As innkeeper, you have to report these things, don't you?
Please study it well.
LORD ASANO'S CREST
Say, listen. Get out, quick!
What's wrong?
Otoki, don't get excited.
Don't sit down. Where'd it go?
Who?
Not him, it. Where is it? Where?
What?
You know, that!
There'd have been advance warning if Steward Obana was coming.
Say Officer Koga wishes to see him.
No, Officer Koga.
Why? I have doubts, so I'll check.
If he's an imposter, you'll be an accomplice.
No, it's no mistake.
He's Steward Obana.
Well, you would know.
Actually, checking was an excuse.
I wanted to thank him for being so kind when he was here last year.
Just let me in for a minute.
No, he's not the same.
What do you mean?
He's here on behalf of the Prince this time.
He's in a high position, so you can't see him.
Do you have proof?
Proof? The proof is this.
Show due respect. Bow!
The Prince's own handwriting.
Last year I asked him for some, to have as our household treasure.
Today I received this from Steward Obana.
This is your proof. Study it.
Yes, without a doubt.
Hanbei, I thank you.
Take this. You may need it again at the Hakone guardpost.
SEIKANJI FAMILY STEWARD
MITSUTADA OBANA'S LODGINGS
You're strange today.
No, what I did was right.
Remember Otoki, our guest's name is Steward Obana. Understand?
Yes, I've begun to believe it too.
OYAMA-YA INN
What Okano got for us is priceless.
A new storehouse with a passage underground out to a vacant lot.
We must be careful here.
Father!
If those Dutchmen knew, would they think we're doing the right thing?
I see. That's how you young people think.
That's not all we think about.
But our willingness to die for a just cause is the same as yours.
Takada.
Seems our time is approaching.
I can't even go to Lord Kira's housewarming.
I may not last out the year.
Nonsense. Cheer up and imitate
Lord Kira a little.
How is he?
Very fit. Full of lusty vigor.
I'm glad he's well, but be careful of his surroundings.
I've seen to that with bodyguards and a fortified new house.
In an emergency, there's a secret exit.
I'm sure it won't be needed.
I hope not.
Well done, Otaka.
Kira's opening his tea room on the 14th...the day our lord died.
That's the day we must do it.
What a racket. They must be crazy.
It must annoy you.
Yes, but I can't complain to men of high standing.
We're annoyed too.
Why don't they do something?
Who?
You know, Lord Asano's men.
Not only us...all Edo is angry.
What use is complaining?
Kuranosuke,
I'm glad you've come.
I am glad to see you well...
I wish I could say that, but everything has changed.
My deepest sympathy, Lady Asano.
Please have some.
Thank you. I will, if I may.
Excellent sake.
Warms you up inside.
Poor hospitality, living as I do now.
Ume, serve him more.
Thank you.
By the way, what brought you to Edo so suddenly?
Actually, I came to bid my lady farewell.
Farewell?
It's not just me. We've all been masterless samurai too long.
We're tired of being so poor that we're nearly starving.
But no lord will employ us.
So I've decided to settle down in Yamashina and become a farmer.
Chamberlain!
Some of the men say we should go and avenge our lord.
But it's only the voice of their desperation.
Or their miserable attempt to succeed by attracting attention.
Kuranosuke.
You really mean to retire to Yamashina?
Yes, my lady.
How could your samurai spirit allow you to?
If I closed my eyes to reality and led a raid on Kira's mansion...
I would have popular approval.
But the world is not so simple.
I understand.
Till today I believed there were still true samurai among you.
That is why I lived on in a world that holds no meaning for me.
I must pray for my dead husband.
I bid you farewell.
Please wait, my lady.
For the last time, may I offer incense at my lord's memorial?
No, you may not.
I do not refuse for my own sake.
The prayers of a person like you would not please our late lord.
Chamberlain.
What is my brother doing?
Junai Onodera...
Is he giving up his sword also?
Yes, I believe so.
It's too shocking. Tell him
I can no longer call him my brother.
Yes, I will.
Lady Asano scolded me, so I almost forgot this...
It holds keepsakes from Lord Asano.
They are too precious for a farmer so I'd better return them.
Not today. Tell her tomorrow when she's in a better mood.
I will keep it.
I won't see you off.
Then you didn't know?
He doesn't come or write, so...
I see. But I told him to tell the customers.
Young men are unreliable.
Kujuro went home.
Oh...and when is he coming back?
He isn't coming back any more.
I see.
The girl came, Okano.
Okano! Time to get ready.
Will it stop snowing by nightfall?
Have you written to your mother?
What about?
Not to grieve too much, and to say prayers for us.
That we are not dying over a personal grievance...
And to forgive her undutiful son for leaving this world before her.
If my own mother were alive,
I think I'd have said the same thing.
No, Father.
I don't think I wrote my true feelings.
I don't know how to express it, so it came out sounding ordinary.
Father, I don't regret that my life is so short.
But I wish I'd been able to write a letter that satisfied me.
To have doubts until the moment we die...perhaps that's just human.
I knew it.
I knew you were no ordinary rice shop man.
But a samurai of the Asano Clan!
I've betrayed my friends by telling you. My life ends tonight.
I didn't want to die having lied to you.
I'm glad. You've repaid my love.
I'm happy.
Our last farewell.
Smile when you see me off.
Let's have a drink.
There's still time, isn't there?
Yes.
But when it's time, let me go.
Promise you will.
I know. No matter how hard it is, when it's time I'll do this.
Then go quickly, without a word.
See, Otama, he came, didn't he?
She called me the god of poverty.
I said no, customers will come in after me, so I'm the god of luck.
See what I mean?
I went by your school.
You did?
I see.
Otama, hot sake!
You've found a new place to serve?
Yes.
I see. It's come.
Good of you to tell me.
Let's drink the night out in farewell.
No, I can't.
We're friends, Yasubei Horibe.
Drink and recite your heroic deeds.
Not tonight. Not tonight.
I see.
Come in.
What did the doctor say?
Nothing serious, he said.
It's not true, is it?
Tell me the truth.
All right.
It'll be 5 or 6 days till you can pull a noodle cart again.
That long?
Don't worry. Just stay in bed till you're well.
I'll have my husband get your medicine.
Hungry?
If you want something, do this.
Understand?
Only 39 men.
They've stopped coming.
Chamberlain, if...just in case...
What?
If they don't all come, we'll need to change the plan.
And if someone who doesn't come...
Say the rest.
If Kira bribes someone, and he reports us...
Stop it.
If there were such a person?
It's obvious. Police will swarm in.
Quiet, please.
Many unforeseen things may happen before we die.
We all have parents, wives and children.
And the time isn't up yet.
But...
Those who promised to come tonight have shared all our hardships.
And they've stayed to the end.
Should we doubt them now?
It's unworthy of us.
It's a fine line between doubting them and regretting that we came.
Let us have faith in the missing, and believe everything favors us.
Let's wait quietly.
Kira will stay the night after opening his tea ceremony room.
Forty men including Otaka?
What's wrong, Horibe?
I feel restless.
Quite a few are still missing.
Your son Yasubei too.
He'll be here without fail.
But why am I so jumpy?
It's not like me.
I wish they'd come.
Is it still snowing?
I'll see.
I'd feel better if someone came.
Tanaka, Nakamura and the Suzuki brothers have dropped out.
At this hour? Why?
Doesn't say.
They couldn't come themselves...
But it says they'll keep silent.
Being together gave them courage to drop out.
Courage? They're afraid to die.
Is that courage?
It is a kind of courage.
Think how much they suffered till writing this letter.
It must be even harder for those who've dropped out without writing.
What's the matter?
Help me. I must be on time!
They'll think I'm a low-born coward who ran away.
What are you talking about?
Please tell them Kichiemon is sick.
He's ill, so...
Where? Who?
I can't tell you that. Not that!
He's drunk. Ignore him.
Let's go.
Another one!
Sorry I'm late.
Yasubei!
Drinking at a time like this!
I was worried. You fool!
I'm going.
What's wrong?
Same thing over and over.
I say I'm going and you shake your head.
If you go, I'll report you.
I'll tell them.
That the Asano men are raiding
Kira's mansion tonight.
Will you still go?
I can't believe it.
Be reasonable. Let me go. Please!
No. Kill me first.
Or give up being a samurai...
And give me up.
47 men have come.
47 men. To know what is right and to do it are two different things.
But those who decided not to do it will suffer longer than we do.
Hara.
The plan is that...
At the sound of the 4 o'clock drum we enter from front and rear gates.
Be extremely careful of fire.
No attacks on unarmed bystanders, or women and children.
Our object is Kira.
Whoever finds him, whistle.
What's the meeting about?
Just get the numbers right.
Here you are.
Here it is!
Intruder!
I have just heard.
What was Kuranosuke's bundle?
A ledger.
Ledger?
Yes, my lady, with accounts of all the money he borrowed from you.
Some for our lord's tombstone and offerings.
Some for travel expenses, for the needy, for weapons.
He made up the deficits out of his own pocket.
A letter too?
Yes.
He says, "Nothing was wasted.
It was all spent for tonight."
Then Kuranosuke...?
He didn't trust Ume, so he said nothing before leaving.
I had no idea. I'm so ashamed.
I'm ashamed, yet happy.
Our lord would also rejoice.
"Nothing was wasted.
It was all spent for tonight."
"For tonight."
We, the vassals of Lord Asano, have come for Kira's head!
Get up!
Come out, everyone, a raid!
Begging your pardon, we have come for Kira.
As neighbors, you may try to send aid...
But I speak for all of us in begging you not to help him.
Well done.
If Kira's men scale the wall, we'll drive them back.
Thank you for your words.
SAMPEI KAYANO
Go!
Gone!
Still warm. Keep looking!
Watch it! Out of the way!
Come out!
Old man!
Father!
Yasubei, stay away!
Are you hurt?
Fool! You ruined my chance at glory.
Kanzaki of Asano Clan.
Shimizu is my name.
Go back. No one passes!
Who are you?
Gemba Tawaraboshi. Nobody passes!
Find him?
No.
Mountain.
River.
Find him?
Not in the secret passage. Search!
Kira, where are you?
See him?
No. Gone.
Search!
Gone. Search!
Escaped?
Gone. Where is he hiding?
We'll be in trouble if it takes too long.
Lord Uesugi or police will come.
After all this.
If that happens, we've vowed to commit harakiri all together.
Even if we do, this will not have been in vain.
If we can only find him before dawn.
Can't you find him? No hope?
Let's gather the men here.
I want to thank you again for your long suffering.
We must discuss what to do next.
Please blow the whistle.
The same scar.
Wait.
Yes.
We meet for the first time.
We are the vassals of Lord Asano.
We have come for your head.
Please commit harakiri.
I will not!
Why should I?
I don't want to die.
It can't be helped.
Lord Kira, prepare to die.
Tell me one thing.
Were you just acting?
Or did you really like her a little?
I loved her.
What?
I asked permission to come and tell her.
Otsuya!
Kujuro.
Forgive me, Otsuya.
Otsuya!
47 of Lord Asano's former vassals raided Kira's residence.
They went in armed.
In flagrant disregard for the authorities, they beheaded Kira.
For this deed, they were ordered to commit harakiri.

Aussteigen.
Tor aufmachen!
Go inside.
Hurry up.
This way.
Hurry up.
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?
- I...
- No, that's mine.
Allez... hup!
How far are the trees, Danny?
- Over 200 feet.
- Yeah, I'd say 300.
Long ways to dig.
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.
Willie, you think X got away?
He'd have sent us word, somehow, if he had.
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.
Good morning, Group Captain.
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer, you are to be liaison between the prisoners and the colonel.
He wishes to make clear to you certain matters of...
- The word is "policy"?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Herein.
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.
I am Colonel Von Luger.
Please sit down.
Group Captain Ramsey, in the past four years the Reich has been forced to spend an enormous amount of time, energy, manpower and equipment hunting down escaping prisoner-of-war officers.
At least it's rather nice to know you're wanted, isn't it?
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty of all officers to try to escape.
If they can't, it is their duty to cause the enemy to use an inordinate number of troops to guard them, and their sworn duty to harass the enemy to the best of their ability.
Yes, I know.
The men under your authority have been most successful.
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.
Caught in the North Sea, escaped, recaptured, escaped, recaptured.
Archibald "Archie" Ives, eleven escape attempts.
Even tried to jump out of the truck coming here.
Dickes, William.
Known to have participated in digging of
11 escape tunnels.
Flight Lieutenant Willinski, four escapes.
MacDonald, nine.
Hendley, the American, five.
Haynes, four. Sedgwick, seven.
The list is almost endless.
One man here has made 17 attempted escapes.
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.
- Quite.
- And it must stop!
Colonel, do you expect officers to forget their duty?
No.
It is because we expect the opposite that we have brought you here.
This is a new camp.
It has been built to hold you and your men.
It is organized to incorporate all we have learned of security measures.
And, in me, you will not be dealing with a common jailer, but with a staff officer personally selected for the task by the Luftwaffe high command.
We have, in effect, put all our rotten eggs in one basket, and we intend to watch this basket carefully.
Very wise.
You will not be denied the usual facilities.
Sports, a library, a recreation hall...
And, for gardening, we will give you tools.
We trust you to use them for gardening.
Devote your energies to these things.
Give up your hopeless attempts to escape.
And, with intelligent cooperation, we may all sit out the war... as comfortably as possible.
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.
Of course. Why do you come to Germany?
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?
- In 1812 they burned your Capitol.
- That's propaganda.
It's in the history books. I read it.
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.
Yeah. No tools.
Hey, Virgil.
Hey, did you see the cooler?
Boy, is it ever a big one!
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.
Those two guys who were with us in the old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- I guess.
What were their names?
It was Jackson and, uh...
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Danny. Who are they?
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.
Willie, cigarettes.
Danny and I have a blitz in mind.
Could you put on a brief show for the goons?
Sure, man. What'll it be?
An all-out go?
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles?
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!
- Are you pushing me?
- That's mine, you son of a...
Tovarich.
Spasibo.
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!
It's all right, mate.
We're just having a friendly little argument.
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.
You, too!
Get away! Get back in your huts!
Go on!
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only one other American in the whole camp.
Some guy named Hendley in the RAF Eagle squadron.
Hey, you got something goin' already?
See the way the goons got those towers placed?
There's a blind spot through the middle.
A blind spot?
A guy could stand at that wire and not be seen by either tower.
They'd never see me, especially at night.
You're crazy.
You think so?
Let's find out right now.
Now, the next step's a little tricky.
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.
I think I'll take a little walk.
Abteilung marsch!
Tovarich.
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.
- Let me have it, mate.
- Ja vas lublu.
- Ja vas...
- Lublu.
Lublu? Ja vas lublu.
Ja vas lublu.
- What's it mean?
- I love you.
I love you? What bloody good is that?
I don't know. I wasn't going to use it myself.
Halt!
Out.
- Out!
- Nyet, nyet. Tovarich.
Your friend, yes?
Tovarich.
And who vouches for you, Lieutenant Willinski?
Get out, Sedgwick.
Spasibo.
Marsch!
Hold it, hold it!
- Your name?
- Ives.
Ives. Ives.
Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.
The photograph doesn't do you justice.
I'd like to see one of you under similar circumstances.
I will not take action against you now.
This is the first day here, and there has been much stupidity and carelessness... on both sides.
Hey! Get out!
Nicht schieben! Nicht schieben!
Don't shoot!
You fool! To cross the wire is death!
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.
Gettin' my baseball.
Stop this!
Get over the wire immediately!
- OK.
- You stay there!
Out of the way. Out.
What are you doing over here by the wire?
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...
Achtung!
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...
I was trying to cut my way through your wire, because I wanna get out.
Durchsuchen Sie ihn.
- Do you speak German?
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
- Wire cutters.
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite a number of British officers in this war.
And I flatter myself that we understand one another.
You are the first American officer I have met.
Hilts, isn't it?
Captain Hilts, actually.
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.
I suppose what's called in the American army a "hotshot pilot."
Unfortunately, you were shot down anyway.
So we are both grounded for the duration of the war.
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.
I plan on doing so before the war's over.
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?
- About 99 percent.
- Perhaps while you are with us, you will have a chance to learn some.
Ten days isolation, Hilts.
- Captain Hilts.
- Twenty days.
Right.
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?
Cooler.
- Name?
- Ives.
- Flying Officer Ives.
- Cooler, 20 days.
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.
- Hilts.
- Yeah?
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?
No, I was in college.
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.
- How tall are you, Ives?
- Five feet four. Why?
Oh, just wondering.
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.
- Bicycles?
- Motorcycles.
Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.
- Helped pay my tuition.
- I did a wee bit of racing myself.
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?
No, horse racing. Jockey.
Jockey.
Jockey.
Hilts?
Are you there, Hilts?
Yeah, I'm here.
Don't you have them in the States? Jockeys?
- Sure.
- They were the days.
Saturday nights in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.
You had to fight off the birds.
You know, birds.
Girls, man. Girls.
Do you not have them in the States?
Hilts? Are you there, Hilts?
Ives.
What?
You know the kind of clay and gravel we got here in the compound?
How many feet do you think you could get through in eight hours?
I could go through this dirt here like the bit on an end of an auger.
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood, and getting the dirt out, that's what you've to worry about.
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.
How are you going to get the dirt out?
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.
Aye.
Well, what do you think?
I must say, it's an interesting first 20 minutes.
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.
As the sergeant out there says, this is only the first day.
Eric.
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.
He has arrived.
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.
I suggest this prisoner be kept under the strictest security confinement permanently.
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.
We have reason to believe he is the leader of numerous criminal escape attempts.
Squadron Leader Bartlett has been three months in your care, and the Gestapo has only "reason to believe"?
If he once more falls into our hands, he will not be so lucky.
Air-force officer prisoners are the responsibility of the Luftwaffe, not the SS... or the Gestapo.
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.
That is why he is returned, for the moment, to your care.
Of course, if the Luftwaffe is not up to the task, the prisoners will find themselves totally in our charge.
We regretfully are not so professionally understanding.
Squadron Leader Bartlett, if you escape again and be caught, you will be shot.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Herr Kuhn.
Nehmen Sie dem Mann diese Dinger ab.
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?
Well, it's new.
- Here. Let's find you a bed.
- Thanks.
Come in.
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.
The fellows wanted to put up a welcome committee, but that's for later.
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.
New camp, expert guards, the elite.
You met the commandant?
Yes, I did.
What were the Gestapo and the SS doing with you?
They wanted to find out who helped me to the border.
Who else is here? Cavendish?
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.
- Blythe?
- Yes.
Almost the whole X organization.
Almost. They cleaned out all the other camps and dumped us in this one.
As Von Luger put it,
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."
There's madness in their method.
- What about Tommy Bristol?
- No, but there's an American, Hendley.
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.
Last of the tea until the Red Cross gets through again.
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?
Not nearly as rough as I now intend to give them.
Roger, personal revenge must be kept out of what we have to do here.
Too many lives are at stake.
What my personal feelings are is of no importance.
You appointed me Big X, and it's my duty to harass, confound and confuse the enemy to the best of my ability.
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink in this Third Reich of theirs that thousands of troops'll be tied up here looking after us.
How?
By putting more men out of this... perfect camp of theirs than have ever escaped before.
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.
The goons have put every escape artist in Germany here. You said so yourself.
Have you thought of what it might cost?
I've thought of the humiliation if we just tamely submit, knuckle under and crawl.
Surely you don't advocate that, do you, sir?
I have to point out one thing to you, Roger.
No matter how unsatisfactory this camp may be, the high command have left us in the hands of the Luftwaffe, not the Gestapo and the SS.
Look, sir, you talk about the high command of the Luftwaffe, then the SS and the Gestapo.
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.
There's only one way to put it, sir.
They are the common enemies of everyone who believes in freedom.
If they didn't approve of Hitler, why didn't they throw him out?
I have no argument with you, Roger.
As senior officer,
I'm merely pointing out a pertinent fact.
When are you calling a meeting, X?
Tonight.
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the immortal words of our new commandant.
"Devote your energies to things other than escape, and sit out the war as comfortably as possible."
Well, that's exactly what we're going to do.
We're going to devote our energies to sports and gardening, all the cultural pursuits as far as they're concerned.
In fact, we're going to put the goons to sleep.
Meanwhile... we dig.
Now, even a superficial look at the compound shows us that huts 104 and five are closest to the woods.
The first tunnel goes out from 105, directly east under the cooler and the wire.
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.
- I make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down 30 feet before we go horizontal.
That'll rule out any question of sound detection or probing.
All right, Roger, but... did you say the first tunnel?
I did. There'll be three.
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.
If the goons find one, we'll move into the other.
How many men do you plan to take out, Roger?
Two hundred and fifty.
There'll be no half measures this time.
Identification papers for everyone.
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Mostly civilian clothes.
Yes, but, uh...
OK, Roger.
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations, compasses for all the walkers.
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.
- We're going to tunnel.
- Splendid.
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, in charge of traps.
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions.
Mac, of course, will take care of intelligence.
Hendley. We haven't met.
- Scrounger?
- Right.
Dennis, maps and surveys.
Colin, you'll take your usual job.
Eric, how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated three tunnels, but we'll manage.
Roger, who's going to handle security for all this?
You are. I want a system of stooges covering this compound from front to back, checking every goon in and out.
I want a signal system so perfect that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet of any of the huts in which we're working, we can shut down without a sign.
Well, I don't think there's much point in discussing any more now.
I'll meet each of you on the exercise circuit, we'll pound out the details.
- Nothing else, is there, Mac?
- I shouldn't think so, Roger.
Oh, hello. My name's Blythe.
Hendley.
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.
Oh, not hunting. Watching.
Oh, a... bird watcher?
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.
I suppose you have bird watchers in the States?
Yes, we have some.
Tea?
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.
- Where's your kit?
- This is it.
The rest was confiscated in the last shakedown.
The goons didn't appreciate some of my more... personal items.
Such as.
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.
I'll need a camera.
- What kind?
- A good one.
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter should do all right.
All right.
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.
- Only one?
- Two would be better.
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.
I must have used these wretched leaves about 20 times.
It's not that I mind so much.
Tea without milk is so uncivilized.
Yeah. I'll get our wood.
Close up! Close up!
Close up!
Close up!
Close up!
- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up!
Splendid.
Blythe, what are you doing here?
I'm in Photographic Aerial Reconnaissance Interpretation.
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?
I'm the forger.
Forgers are installing themselves in the recreation hut.
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 110.
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.
- 109? Right.
- I'll work in 107.
For now, Danny, Willie and their trap team will be in 104.
I want to take a chance on the tunnels and press ahead without any shoring-up.
We will need timber for the shafts and the entrance chambers.
Hendley figures there are 36 empty bunks.
We can tear up 15 and move the men around so the goons won't miss them.
The rest will come from strips off the wall.
Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
Not yet.
He's working on some steel for a pick that Danny needs.
Hey! What the hell is going on here?
Turn the water off!
Get your hands away!
Get away!
Hey! What the hell's going on there?
Stop this nonsense!
Get away! Turn the water off!
Somewhere!
In the stove, we keep fire burning, always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 113's washroom.
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.
Not when you're organized, Mac.
- We're ready.
- Big enough?
It's perfect. Right through the middle of the foundation.
Good luck to us, Danny.
Why 17?
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.
All right?
It's good.
It's very good.
- Raus!
- Get out!
- Get out!
- Raus hier!
Raus! Fertig machen da hinten.
Du da hinten. Raus hier!
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?
Mopping up.
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.
Raus!
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.
Raus.
No. I vote no. Look, we've put the goons to sleep exactly like you said.
But just one little thing like this and we're up the creek without a paddle.
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.
I understand you two are contemplating a blitz-out.
Where'd you hear that... sir?
MacDonald. It's Mac's job to know everything that goes on.
We thought, perhaps, we might talk it over.
Why? It's only a two-man job.
Everybody in the camp is supposed to clear all escape attempts in advance with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.
We don't necessarily want to interfere.
It's just that...
Well, what sort of blitz were you contemplating?
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire, a blind spot.
Then we dig down, take the dirt, spread it on top so it won't make a pile, and then straight out.
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs in front, pushes the dirt behind him.
I stash it behind me, then we burrow through the dirt like a couple of moles.
By dawn we're under the wire, across the open space, into the woods and gone.
Well, uh...
When do you intend to try this?
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.
Hilts, this may not be quite the right time for this sort of thing.
Look, sir, I've been in the bag nearly three years now, bloody close to being wire-happy.
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.
It'll work. I know it will.
Good luck.
Thank you.
- Hilts... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.
We shove it up and make air holes as we go along.
Good night, sir.
Now, why didn't anybody think of that before?
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.
But it'll bring every goon in the camp down on top of us.
I don't know. Perhaps we're being too clever.
If we stop all the breakouts, it may only convince the goons that we must be tunneling.
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going to be in the cooler for an awful long time.
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.
This is the dirt from the compound.
This is from the tunnel.
Wherever we put it, they're going to spot it a mile away.
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.
It's the first place the ferrets'd look.
I saw one measuring yesterday.
Maybe we could dry it to the same color.
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.
If you must think, for God's sake, think clearly.
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?
We can't destroy the dirt and we can't eat it.
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.
That's as far as my thinking takes me.
Didn't they teach you promptness in the RN?
You'll never believe it, but I think I have the solution.
The problem is somehow to get rid of this tunnel dirt over the compound.
Well, of course.
Would you mind?
Now... you fill these bags with the dirt from the tunnel.
Then, wearing them inside your trousers, you wander out into the compound where you pull these strings in your pockets.
Out come the pins.
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.
Unless you're a fool, the ferrets won't see a thing.
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. it works.
Mac, this is what we'll do.
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.
Nice garden you've got, sir.
All right. Let's look sharp.
That looks sharp.
Sir.
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.
I am sorry the soil here isn't better suited to your men's purpose.
We'll manage, sir.
I must say I am surprised with the extent of this activity, Group Captain.
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.
- The English are keen on gardening.
- Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.
Good point.
I have the nasty feeling he knows exactly what we're doing.
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.
Here we are. Now, let's see.
Biscuits, two packets.
Coffee, two tins.
Bovril, one jar.
Cigarettes, six packets.
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Blackcurrant jam, Cavendish.
And marmalade, mine.
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.
That cleans out the gift food for the entire organization.
Now, the first thing we need is the new form of travel permit.
The forgers have no idea what it looks like.
I'll see what I can do.
And, of course, any other identity cards, personal papers, documents you can put your hands on.
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.
Good luck.
O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?
Patience is a virtue, Roger.
Yes, I know, but the diggers can only work when the trap's open, and this is holding us up very badly.
- Is it finished?
- Of course.
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.
Mac.
Excellent.
Have it in by tomorrow night.
Christ the Lord
- Got a light?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?
I'll smoke it later, when I'm off duty.
Thank you.
You probably have a couple of roommates, huh?
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.
No, no. Red sky in the morning, sailor takes warning.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
It was a red sky last night.
I never heard that before.
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.
- You were a Boy Scout? So was I.
- Really?
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.
I was working on my 20th when the government abolished scouting and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.
Werner, you think you'll stay in the army after the war?
No. I'm not a well man.
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?
Yes. I could tell you stories about my teeth that would make your hair stand on end.
Our dentist here is a butcher.
But don't tell anyone I said so.
- It's a soldier's right to complain.
- Maybe in your army, but here?
One little criticism, and... to the Russian front.
Is that so? Terrible.
That's terrible.
Werner.
Why don't we go into my room?
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...
I was just gonna make some coffee.
Real coffee.
Coffee, coffee, coffee.
Where is it?
Marmelade. Ist ja wunderbar.
My grandmother keeps sending me this stuff.
- Ach du lieber Gott, Schokolade.
- Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.
- Von Lugers Butter.
- Yeah. Keep it.
Nein. I must go.
It's OK. You can keep it.
We're friends.
With you in the cooler, will we be friends?
I must report this.
I don't understand you. Report what?
That you and I were chatting in my room?
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.
- I'll never be able to eat it all.
- Nein, ich muss jetzt weg.
I'm sorry. All right.
Forget it. Forget it.
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember, is the voice of the Nelles warbler.
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman, the masked shrike.
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.
The shrike impales his foes on the spikes of thorn bushes.
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the coloring.
Uniform black above, from head to tail.
A black rump, a black crown with a bold white flash, and a white line over the eye.
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country...
Hendley. Sit down.
You'll find drawing materials on the table.
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country, olive groves and gardens.
Well, Hendley, have you taken to birds, too, now?
Yeah. Stick around. You might learn something.
I have better things to do than draw birds.
The voice is a monotonous succession of scratchy, complaining notes.
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...
An Urlaubsschein. Permission to cross a frontier.
Here's another one.
Which one's the forgery?
- That one.
- That's right.
They both are.
What's holding us up now is the new form of this travel permit.
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.
And a military identity card.
And a...
- An Ausweis.
- Yeah.
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.
What appears to be the ferret assignments for the next week.
You get ten out of ten for this, old boy.
Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?
- It's on loan.
In order to get the right amount of outfits, Roger,
I suggest that we work mainly from service uniforms.
I can do double-breasteds, single-breasteds, and rather nice lounge suits.
Lapels. I can do quite a lot of things with those.
I can have them deep like that, or high ones like that.
Here's one that we're working on right now.
Oh, yes. What about buttons?
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.
And, uh... here's one that I dyed with a bottle of blue ink.
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?
The goons'd have a field day if they crashed in on this lot.
That's Sorren's department.
Now, I've started working on the other materials.
This blanket.
Particularly the stripes. Marvelous.
- Coats.
- Yes.
I've got the chaps working on these all over the compound.
Those battle dresses,
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.
I'll have to get the chaps to make those into some sort of working man's outfits.
Blanket ticking.
Now, I've made these into rather nice little Waistcoats.
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.
Just take a look at this, Roger.
Now, this blanket material, we scrape this down until it's really smooth, and then dye it with boot polish.
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.
Good morning, Hilts.
Well, if you're here to find out if I'm going out again, I am.
- When?
- Seventeen days, 7th of July.
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.
- Is Ives going with you?
- Yeah, if he wants to.
You, uh... You know that Ives is close to cracking?
Yeah.
Better for him to go out in the tunnel, huh?
Safer.
Right.
It's possible for one man to get out through the wire, even get away, but there are in fact a considerable number of people besides yourself in this camp who are trying to escape.
I appreciate that.
Something's coming, I can feel it, and it's coming right around the corner at me, Squadron Leader.
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.
Yes, well... as I was saying, uh, Hilts, we have maps of Germany, general maps, that is.
We have all the information we need for the escape routes out of Germany.
But what we do not have... is a clear idea of what's 500 yards beyond those trees.
We've tried every goon in the camp. No go.
We must know the exact position of the local town.
We want to know where we hit the main roads.
Where the police stations are, where they've got their roadblocks.
And, most important of all, we've got to know how to get from here to the railway station.
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,
I'm not gonna be making maps for you guys.
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear if they're shooting at me with howitzers.
- Understandable.
- Completely.
I mean, I'd like to help, but...
Interesting idea.
- How many you taking out?
- Two hundred and fifty.
Two hundred and fifty?
Yeah.
You're crazy. You too.
Two hundred and fifty guys just walking down the road, just like that.
Well, some on the road, some by train, some cross-country.
They'll have forged papers, clothes, maps, compasses, rations.
You're gonna alert every goon in the country.
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork is gonna be out looking for you.
They're gonna swoop down and scoop you up so fast it'd make your head swim.
Yes, well... thanks, anyway.
If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.
- Any time.
Wait a minute.
You aren't seriously suggesting that if I get through the wire and case everything out there and don't get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown back in the cooler so you can get the information you need?
Yes. One has to ask some very strange things in the job I have.
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.
Check.
- Herr Hendley, I...
- Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.
What's the matter, Werner?
My wallet, my papers, my identity card.
Gone. I lost them. Everything.
He lost his wallet.
Do you realize what would happen if Strachwitz found this out?
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.
I've looked every place, every place.
I must have lost them while I was in here.
- No.
- Yes.
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.
Werner.
Not now. It might look a little peculiar if you and I were seen probing around at this time of night.
Look, I'll find them.
I promise you I'll find 'em if I have to tear this room apart.
- Thank you.
- Forget it.
- Werner.
- Yes?
There is one small favor.
A camera.
We want to take some snapshots.
You know... keepsakes.
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.
Focal-plane shutter.
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.
Let me know when you got it.
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid, that Werner, but I like him.
Checkmate.
How soon's our air pump going to be ready?
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.
- No good?
- Today, three times.
Willie, you all right? Pull!
You're gonna have to shore up the whole bloody tunnel, Roger.
- All 335 feet of it.
- Four times today.
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.
It's a lot of timber, Roger.
Can you get it?
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.
I'll put Hendley on it, and the new man we got this morning.
OK, Willie.
On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me
A partridge in a pear tree
On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the fourth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the fifth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Five gold rings
How's it going with the rafters up there?
Taking out one in four.
Stay with it.
Five gold rings
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the seventh day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Seven swans a-swimming, six geese a-laying
Five gold rings
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
Five gold rings, four calling birds...
Bloody singing.
I've never worked so hard in all my life.
Hi, Hilts.
Say, Cavendish...
Three French hens, two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear...
Allez... hup!
Never mind.
Here's a present from our friend, Werner.
Splendid. Simply splendid.
This should do very nicely.
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.
He requested permission to dispose of some of his dirt in our attic.
Tom has reached just beyond that pile of wood, sir.
Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?
- We make it 50 feet, sir.
- Dark of the moon is the seventh...
- Eight and ninth.
A day earlier in August.
Morning.
There he goes again.
Why is he buying up all the potatoes in the camp?
I've been working on that, but I can't find out.
Hilts and Hendley lock themselves in every night.
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.
Put the entire effort into Tom, and press on into the trees.
Right, Roger.
About face!
Forward march!
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.
It's the Fourth of July.
What the devil's this?
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.
- Quite right, too.
- And a little drink to Tom.
- And to getting home.
- Very well. We accept.
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!
Gentlemen, follow us.
About face!
Company... halt!
All right, let's line up down here!
All right, grab a cup!
Line it up! Here we go.
That explains what happened to the potatoes.
No harm in closing down Tom for one day, Roger.
I suppose it'll do us all good to let off a bit of steam.
There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and you can feel it throughout the whole camp.
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?
Moonshine. American moonshine. Moonshine.
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.
Keep it moving.
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.
- There you go.
- Down with the British.
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?
- Keep it moving.
- Don't get any on your clothes, sir.
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.
Get good and stoned, my friend.
Keep it going. Keep it...
No taxation without representation.
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...
Keep it going, fellas.
Enjoy yourselves.
- Well, let's drink to Tom.
- To Tom.
In the three years, seven months and two weeks that I've been in the bag, that's the most extraordinary stuff
I've ever tasted.
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.
Call on Ives.
Cheers, Hendley!
You know what that is?
I'll tell you what it isn't.
It isn't Napoleon brandy.
How do you like it, sir?
- Well, it's, uh...
- To the colonies.
Independence.
How are you managing over there without us?
Getting along all right, are you?
We seem to be getting along all right, shir... sir.
Yes, well, it's, uh...
It's good stuff, Hilts.
Thank you, sir.
Danny! Here's to...
Roger, goons in 105.
- Who?
- Strachwitz.
We have to ignore it.
If we pay attention, the goons'll know the hut's important.
Here's to going home.
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.
Home!
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you in the tunnel with us. To Tom.
Never mind.
You'll be walking down Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realize that myself.
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.
We're nearly at the trees.
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!
Das ist es also.
Los, holen Sie die Wache!
Ich hab's doch geahnt.
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.
It's the tunnel.
Success.
- Ives!
- Halt! Halt!
Halt!
Sir, let me know the exact information you need.
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.
Open up, Harry. We dig.
Around the clock.
- Cooler.
- Right.
Well, I didn't think they'd catch him so soon.
He wasn't caught.
Hilts, welcome home.
Danny?
Danny?
Danny?
Are you all right, Danny?
Yes. All right.
All right. Bring some shovels.
I'm all right.
For God's sake, you've left out a whole eagle.
That's impossible.
Yes.
Four days' work up the bloody spout!
- I'm sorry, Colin.
- It's all right, Smithy.
It's getting late. You push off to bed.
I'll pack up here.
All right.
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Hut ab.
Sehr gut. In Ordnung. Danke schön.
- Bitte schön.
- Herein.
Heil Hitler.
- Wie heiben Sie?
- Erich Stressel, aus München.
Warum sind Sie hier?
Ich habe Urlaub bekommen.
Meine Mutter ist krank.
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up a suspect.
Don't fall for that old gag.
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.
Herein.
One, two, three, four, five.
Roger.
No, it's me.
How do you like the old escape suit?
Fine, fine.
Colin.
How do you like mine?
It looks splendid.
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.
Danny, we're getting out through the tunnel.
We're almost clear.
Please, Willie, let me alone.
I can't go in that tunnel anymore.
So I'm going out through the wire.
Danny, think. We're getting out, but not through the wire.
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.
- I go out now.
- No.
Danny, you go through that wire and you'll get killed.
Don't do that.
Willie...
Since I was a boy,
I hate... and feared little rooms, closets, caves.
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.
Because I must get out.
I hide the fear, and I dig.
But tomorrow night in the tunnel with all those men,
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head, and ruin the escape for everybody.
So I go now.
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.
All right.
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.
Well, how do you think we look?
Guten Abend, mein Herr.
Wie geht es Ihnen?
It's as bad as all that?
Colin, I want first of all to say that without you, we would not have been ready.
That's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.
What's the matter, Roger?
You can't go.
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.
Why?
You can't see your hand in front of your face.
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
Never heard anything so absurd in my life.
I can see perfectly.
I can see perfectly!
I can see... that pin down there.
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?
Yes, of course.
Put the pin down there, will you?
All right.
All right. Come on. Come on. Sit down.
Sit down. It was a good try.
I hate these last-minute letdowns, but I've only just been told.
It's too risky for you.
Don't you think that's Colin's decision?
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.
We all know the score here.
Well, at least... most of us do.
Your idea of this escape is to start another front, to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.
But once we get past that wire and have them looking all over Germany for us, that mission is accomplished.
Afterwards, we have some ideas of our own.
You mean getting home?
- Back to your family?
- That's right.
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that, too?
I'm sure you have.
I know Colin has.
And, Roger, I have, too.
We think we can make it all the way.
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard to the escape. That must be my decision.
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.
No one has said you can't go.
That's true.
I have thought about the Gestapo.
But if you're asking me how far a commanding officer is allowed to go, or dare go, or should be permitted to play God,
I can't answer you.
But I can tell you a blind man is an unnecessary hazard to himself and the whole plan, and must therefore be eliminated from the operation.
Colin's not a blind man as long as he's with me, and he's going with me.
It's all right with you, Colin?
Oh, yes. Quite.
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape numbers to be altered accordingly.
Good night, gentlemen.
Actually... he's quite right.
He's completely right.
I really shouldn't go at all.
My eyes have been getting worse and worse lately.
I think they call it progressive myopia.
I can see things up here. Close to.
I can see to work, but, uh...
- you're just a blur.
- I know.
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.
Colin, do you have any tea?
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.
Splendid.
Raus.
- Hi, Hilts.
- Hey, Mac.
When?
Tonight. We thought they'd never let you out.
Me, too. Let's get at it.
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.
What time?
Only eight minutes now, Danny.
You OK?
Cavendish.
Griff, down there.
Goff, there.
Smith, Foles, third on the right.
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.
There are the lights.
Right on the tick, Danny.
Look down the tunnel, Danny.
It's lovely.
It's just like Blackpool at the height of the season.
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?
Yes. No.
I don't know.
It's time, Roger.
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.
It's all clear, sir.
All set, Roger.
Roger.
Good luck.
They're coming down the shaft now, Danny.
And then they'll be coming right up the tunnel.
Willie... I can't wait. I must get out.
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.
Danny, tell me what this is, and tell me quickly!
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.
Let me out. Let me out.
Take him out, Willie.
Take him out.
Danny? What is it?
Danny, what's going on?
It's all right, Sedgwick.
It's all right. We're going later.
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.
All right, Colin. Down you go.
Sit down. Feel the top rung of the ladder with your right foot. Got it?
Down you go.
Danny cut out, huh?
Willie took him up top.
Hilts, I, uh...
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.
Right.
Bartlett.
All right?
Hold onto yourself.
You're 20 feet short.
What do you mean?
Twenty feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.
The guard is between us and the lights.
How could that happen?
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!
We could postpone it.
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.
One chance.
When the guard goes to the far end, you might be able to move out.
I think I can make it to the woods, set up a signal when you're clear.
What about the towers?
They're gonna be watching the compound, not the woods.
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.
Send down 30 feet of rope!
Send down 30 feet of rope.
Send down 30 feet of rope!
- What?
- Thirty feet of rope!
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.
Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
I don't think so, sir.
He's over there.
Right. You go first, Eric.
I'm staying here till we get moving.
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.
Right.
Thank you.
- Good luck.
- Right.
We're moving.
Danny, they're moving through the tunnel now.
They're getting out.
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and came to England because you're a flier.
You came because you wanted to fly with us and fight the Germans.
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.
If you don't go through that tunnel, everything you've done will have been for nothing, nothing!
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.
- In here, Colin.
- Come on.
Sit down.
You're up, Sedgwick.
I'll take over.
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?
I wish he was home with his kangaroos.
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?
Hilts is on the other end of that rope in the woods.
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs, off you go, but keep Colin low.
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.
What's that?
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.
Come on, Colin.
We can get out when the lights go down.
Willie.
Willie!
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!
Get 'em out.
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.
Light the lamps down there!
There's been an air raid and they've cut the lights.
Danny, it's all right.
Listen to me!
Danny, look.
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.
What the hell's going on?
- You go.
- No. Danny.
Go.
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.
Get him out fast.
Come on.
Come on, Danny, move.
Up you go.
Give me your bag.
We're on the rope!
You and I had better get out, or we won't have a chance of any of the trains.
It's moving. We'll just have to pass the instructions from man to man.
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.
Ist da jemand?
- Hast du etwas gehört?
- Nein.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Get off! We're coming back!
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot of shooting going on up there.
Think they've been shooting them as they came out?
We would've heard the shots before.
- Pull!
- Wait for me.
Out.
Out.
Die Aufstellung, Herr Hauptmann.
- Sechsundsiebzig.
- Jawohl.
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.
Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!
Half the guys who missed their trains are piled up here.
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.
Makes quite a group.
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.
Merci.
Können Sie mich mitnehmen?
Aber gerne. Steigen Sie ein.
Danke schön.
Ihre Pässe, bitte.
Tallyho.
- Vous êtes Français?
- Oui.
Moi, aussi.
- Merci bien.
- Merci.
Tallyho.
- Sie reisen für eine Firma?
- Ja.
Für mein...
Fur mein Geschäft.
- Danke.
- Danke.
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.
All right.
I'll tell you when.
I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
That's quite exciting.
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.
Switzerland.
Hey!
Wo willst du hin? Komm mal her.
Wo willst du denn hin?
Zeig mal deinen Ausweis.
Bartlett.
Alles auf den Boden.
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- I, uh... I hadn't quite decided.
What information were you to collect on the way?
None.
What sabotage directions did you receive?
What have you done with your papers?
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?
All I did was escape from a prison camp.
You'd do the same if you'd been locked up for three years.
I wanted to get home.
I don't think you'll see your wife again.
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.
You're wearing civilian clothes.
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.
I dyed it with boot polish to cover some oil smears
I picked up when I was shot down.
And you lost your insignia over the years?
That's right.
Bringen Sie ihn zu den anderen.
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.
Hello, boys.
Hello.
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.
I wish I could say I was happy to see you again.
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.
There's a trainer out there I can fly.
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.
Colin, when I say go, crank this clockwise.
When the engine catches, don't move, or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.
Go!
Next stop, Switzerland!
- The Alps.
- Splendid.
Over this range, then 20 more minutes and we've got it made.
- What is it? Petrol?
- I don't know. We're losing power.
Go that way! I'll follow.
Hendley?
Colin!
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!
Colin... I'm sorry I fouled things up.
That's all right.
Thank you for... getting me... out.
Los, aufstehen.
Hände hoch.
Bonjour, messieurs.
Comment ça va? Ça va bien?
Bonjour.
Comme d'habitude, trois Pernod, n'est-ce pas?
Trois Pernod, Papa.
Café Suzette.
Oui.
- Et voilà, messieurs, les trois Pernod.
- Merci.
Deux...
Et trois. Et voilà de l'eau.
- Bon appétit, messieurs.
- Merci.
Monsieur. Téléphone pour vous.
- Téléphone pour moi?
- Oui, monsieur, téléphone.
Par ici.
Voilà, téléphone.
Merci.
Hello?
Hello?
Resistance.
Resistance?
You are English?
I'm Australian.
- Dites-moi...
- You can speak English. I understand.
Bloody good. I'm a British officer.
I've just escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.
I'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?
- Oui.
- Can you help me?
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.
Geheime Staatspolizei.
Ihren Ausweis, bitte.
- Français?
- Jawohl.
- Commerçant?
- Mais oui. Parlez-vous français?
- Un peu.
- Votre accent est très bon.
Je l'ai étudié dans l'école supérieure.
Très bien. Passez.
Au revoir, monsieur. Au revoir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Halt!
Zwei vom Lager sind getürmt. Engländer.
Los!
Alles einsteigen.
Einsteigen.
Halt! Halt!
Stehen bleiben! Hände hoch!
- Was soll das?
- You are English.
Engländer?
Sie drohen mir mit einer Pistole?
- Nehmen Sie die weg.
- Ach, Sie sind Deutscher?
- Selbstverständlich.
- Schon gut. Entschuldigung.
Herr Bartlett?
- Ich heibe Fröhlich.
- Your German is good.
And I hear also your French.
Your arms... up!
Ausgezeichnet!
Herr Bartlett... and Herr MacDonald.
We are together again.
You are going to wish you had never put us to so much trouble.
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.
I expected either a long stay or a very short trip.
Yes.
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried, though.
I hope to God I haven't blotted 70-odd ledgers.
No, no.
We're all over 21, footloose and fancy-free.
We'd never have got as far as we did without you, Roger.
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.
- I think we all do.
- Yes.
Was ist los? Wo sind wir?
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.
It will take hours before you reach the camp.
You know, Mac, all this, the organization, tunneling,
Tom and Harry, kept me alive.
And even though we...
I've never been happier.
You know, Mac...
Eleven of your men are being returned today.
- Oh, who?
- I do not have that information.
I...
I am directed by a higher authority to inform you that...
50 of your officers were shot while escaping.
Shot?
Their... personal effects will be returned.
How many of them were wounded?
Here are the names... of the dead.
How many of the 50 were wounded?
None. They, the higher authority... only directs me to inform you that... that 50 men were...
I see.
Addison, John.
Alladale, Peter.
Bancroft, Edward.
Bartlett, Roger.
Cavendish, Dennis.
Eldridge, David.
Felton, William.
Fanshaw, Arthur.
- Ici?
- Oui, monsieur. C'est ici.
Alors, au revoir.
- Merci beaucoup, monsieur.
- Pas de quoi. Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
- Bonne chance.
I am your guide, señor.
For Spain?
España.
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.
What happened to Blythe?
He didn't make it, sir.
Roger was right about that.
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.
I've just posted the list.
They shot... 50.
The Gestapo murdered them.
Fifty? MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?
No, they're not on the list.
- Haynes?
- Yes. I'm sorry.
Roger's idea was to get back at the enemy the hardest way he could.
Mess up the works.
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.
Do you think it was worth the price?
That depends on your point of view, Hendley.
Yes, sir.
Achtung!
Achtung!
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.
The job just didn't work out, huh?
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...
How many?
Fifty.
It looks, after all, as if you will see Berlin before I do.
Sir.
Hey, Hilts!
English - US
All ready here, sir. Crew standing by and awaiting your word. Over.
Right. Over and out.
Our man was brought down at 2 a. m. this morning.
SHAEF, in their all-knowing wisdom, didn't let us know until 10 a. m.
Damned idiots.
Damned idiots for not letting us know.
Double damned idiots for ignoring our advice in the first place.
Anyway, here he is...
...in a town called Werfen...
...at the Schloss Adler, the Castle of the Eagles.
And believe me, it's well-named, because only an eagle can get to it.
Our job is to get inside there and get him out as soon as possible...
...before they can get the information from him.
How are you so sure that he's there, sir?
The Mosquito he was in crash-landed only 10 miles away.
The Schloss Adler is the headquarters of the
German secret service in southern Bavaria.
Where else would they take him?
- How did the plane crash, sir?
- Through the most damnable ill luck.
We carried out a saturation raid on Nuremberg last night.
There shouldn't have been a German fighter within 100 miles of the Austrian border.
A wandering Messerschmitt patrol got him.
Anyway, that's not important.
What is important is that we get him out before he talks.
Or I should say, you get him out.
What about paratroops, sir?
The Schloss Adler is inaccessible and impregnable.
It would require a battalion of paratroops to take it.
We haven't got the time.
Stealth and secrecy are our only hope...
...and you gentlemen are,
I trust, stealthy and secretive.
We realize of course that you've never worked together before as a team...
...but you're familiar with one another, except for Lieutenant Schaffer here.
You probably noticed that Lieutenant Schaffer...
...wears the shoulder flashes of the American Ranger division.
I think that speaks for itself.
Major Smith will lead the group in.
Now, you're all expert at survival behind enemy lines.
Smith, Lieutenant Schaffer...
...Sergeants Harrod and MacPherson in their military capacities...
...the rest of you in other duties.
You all speak fluent German.
You've been trained in different types of combat.
If anybody has a chance of getting him out, you have.
There is, of course, another way, sir.
A way with a 100 percent guarantee of success.
Neither Admiral Rolland or I claim to be omniscient or infallible.
Is there an alternative that we've missed?
Whistle up a pathfinder squadron of Lancasters with 10-ton bombs.
I don't think anybody in that castle would ever talk again.
Nor do I think that you grasp the realities of the situation.
The captured man, General Carnaby, is an American.
If we were to destroy him, then I think General Eisenhower...
...might launch his second front against us rather than against the Germans.
There are certain niceties to be observed in our relationship with our allies.
Very well, then, gentlemen.
Ten o'clock tonight at the airfield.
- No more questions, I take it?
- Yes, sir.
Begging the colonel's pardon, sir.
What's all this about?
I mean, why is this man so damned important?
- Why should...?
- That'll do, sergeant.
You have all the information you require.
I think if we're sending a man to what may be his death...
...he has a right to know why.
It's painfully simple, sergeant.
General Carnaby is one of the overall coordinators...
...of planning for the second front.
He set out last night to meet his opposite numbers in the Middle East...
...to finalize the plans for the invasion of Europe.
The rendezvous with the Russians was to have been in Crete.
Now, unfortunately, his plane didn't get through.
Now, if the Germans can make him talk...
...it could mean no second front this year.
- Do you understand, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry, sir.
That's all right, sergeant. Forget it.
Now, if you have any more questions,
Major Smith will answer them.
That's all, gentlemen.
Get them ready.
We're approaching the drop area.
Stand by!
Green on! Go!
Where's Harrod?
Well, last time I saw him, he was drifting towards those trees over here.
All right. Spread out.
Let's go and find him.
Major!
- His neck's broken.
- Damn it.
Well, what do we do now?
Do we bury him or do we leave him here?
We leave him here. The snow will cover him in a couple of hours.
Get back and pick up the equipment.
I want to see if the radio's still working.
Well...
...the radio works all right. There's a barn about a mile down the valley.
We'll use it to check our equipment.
- What about the people who live in it?
- There aren't any.
This is a high alpine pasture.
They bring the cattle up in May and take them down in September.
The rest of the time, the place is totally deserted.
Come on. Let's go.
Somehow, you know, this just isn't me.
It's not any of us, Jock.
You're the cook. Cook...
...some hot food and some hot coffee, and then call London on the radio.
Damn it. I left that codebook in Sergeant Harrod's tunic.
- I'll go and get it for you.
- No, it's all right. It's my own stupid fault.
Sounds as if it's still blowing a blizzard.
Yeah.
Well, if I'm not back in an hour...
...signal me with a flare pistol four times every five minutes.
That should bring a blind man home.
Might also bring the best part of a German regiment.
There's not a German within five miles.
Nobody leaves here until I come back.
- Jock, save me some coffee.
- It'll be cold by then.
They say that's an advantage.
You can't taste cold coffee.
Halt.
Turn around.
You took your time getting here, didn't you?
Things to attend to.
- You enjoy your trip?
- Lovely.
I nearly froze to death in that damn plane.
Why couldn't you have supplied some hot water bottles or an electrically heated suit?
- I thought you loved me.
- I can't help what you think.
You managed to bring your gear.
Is that all the greeting I'm going to get?
I'm afraid so, for the time being.
My radio operator was killed in the drop.
What happened?
Something struck him in the back of the neck.
Either the haft of a knife or the butt of a gun.
The skin was unbroken, but badly discolored.
It means someone broke his neck afterwards...
...to make it look like an accident.
Now listen, I'm taking the group at dawn over the ridge into the next valley.
We'll stop in the woods until about 7.
Now, don't stumble into us.
As soon as it's dark, we'll move into the village of Werfen.
In the village, there's a gasthaus called Zum Wilden Hirsch.
Behind it and to the right, there's a woodshed.
I'll meet you there at exactly 8:00 tomorrow night.
- And after that, what?
- I'll let you know when the time comes.
Ah.
- I see you've come fully prepared.
- Never mind about that.
How do you know about all these things,
Zum Wilden Hirsch and the shed?
I'm entitled to know.
You're entitled to know nothing.
We've worked together for three years.
I'm a professional.
So am I.
If I were the marrying kind, which I'm...
- I thought you were in a hurry.
- So I am.
Aren't you?
What kept you?
Well, I was very lucky.
I ran into this fabulous blond.
She was lying on a snowdrift.
Does she have a friend?
No, I'm afraid you're out of luck.
- Thanks for waiting up for me, anyway.
- No problem.
Lieutenant, why don't you go to sleep?
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours.
You too, Jock.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Can't get a thing.
Probably the storm, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll try again in the morning.
Lieutenant, come with me.
The rest of you stay here.
Better leave the equipment here.
Somebody's got to be crazy.
How'd your colonel expect anyone to get in there?
He feels if he can penetrate the German High Command...
...we shouldn't have difficulty getting up.
He did what?
He spent the years '40 to '43 in Germany, first in the Wehrmacht...
...and then finally in General Headquarters in Berlin.
They say he knew Hitler quite well.
- I thought he looked a little nuts.
- Yeah, probably is.
Now we've got problems of our own.
Get the boys into the trees.
We've brought them too far over.
Be sure they go beyond that tree line.
- And what about you?
- I'll be along in a minute.
- Be sure they stay behind the trees.
- All right.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.
Danny Boy calling
Broadsword. Father Machree is waiting.
This is Father Machree, Broadsword.
What is your present position, please?
Over.
Woods due west of castle.
Descending at dusk. Harrod dead.
Over.
Was Harrod killed accidentally? Over.
No. Over.
By the Germans? Over.
No.
Time of next broadcast uncertain.
Will you stand by?
Over.
Colonel Turner and I will remain at headquarters till operation completed.
Good luck. Out.
It looks as though you're right, sir.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Who's next, I wonder?
Smith himself, perhaps.
I doubt that.
Some people have a sixth sense.
He has a sixth, a seventh and an eighth.
- He's our best agent.
- Except yourself.
Still and all, even if he is the best, this whole operation looks impossible now.
Take a look down there, at the foot of the castle.
Dobermans.
Yeah. Dobermans, a guard tower and a wire fence.
Fences can be cut or climbed, lieutenant.
I doubt if that one can be climbed. It's got around 3,000 volts running through it.
If I'm not mistaken, major, that's an army barracks over there.
No mistake. This is the headquarters of the Wehrmacht Alpenkorps.
Swell. If you got any other surprises,
I think I ought to know about them.
I thought you knew, lieutenant.
Why do you think we're not dressed as German sailors?
Training troops come and go all the time.
What are six new faces among 600 new faces?
Look, major, this is primarily a British operation.
I'm an American.
I don't even know why the hell I'm here.
Lieutenant, you're here because you're an American.
Dear Kramer, you have turned a little gray since I saw you last.
I'm afraid so, sir.
- How is Berlin, sir?
- Things have changed.
You like my machine?
- It looks pretty dangerous.
- Well, you must try it.
Major Burkhalter, my adjutant.
Major Brant, Jaeger Battalion.
Colonel Weissner, Field Security.
Major Von Hapen, Gestapo.
- Have you questioned him yet?
- No. I was waiting for you.
That Major Von Hapen, does he know General Carnaby's here?
Yes. I did inform him of his arrival, but not of his importance.
Good. If possible, I'd prefer the Gestapo to be kept out of this matter...
...until we have the information we want.
- Fine.
We don't need them cluttering up things with torture chambers.
This can remain a strictly army matter for the time being.
- I agree.
- Good.
I've had a very tiring trip down here from Berlin. I'd like to freshen up a bit.
Perhaps sleep a few hours before meeting General Carnaby.
I'll see you to your quarters.
Thank you.
The meeting will be ready whenever you wish.
Tell me...
Show me your papers.
Right.
I've written her many times of course, but...
...with so many troops on leave in Berlin, it was hardly likely she'd remember me.
But one always hopes you're the one she'll never forget.
Yeah. What was her name, anyway?
- Fred.
- Fred?
Oh, yeah, I remember Fred, yeah.
She was a short little redhead.
We'll try this one behind us.
When you get inside, circulate around.
Keep your ears open for anything about General Carnaby.
We meet back here in half an hour. All right.
Two beers.
Ah.
See you later.
Anything else needed here? Oh.
And who might you be, my pretty alpine rose?
- Heidi. Stop, major. I've got work.
- There's no more important work...
...than entertaining the soldiers of the fatherland.
- Shall I sing you a song?
- I hear too much singing.
Oh, very well, then. I'll whistle.
It goes like this:
I bet you have a beautiful singing voice too.
Thank you.
Be in the woodshed in five minutes.
Now slap me across the face as hard as you can.
Oh!
Major...
...your conduct does not become an officer of the Wehrmacht.
Herr Major, when you talk to me.
Major Bernd Himmler.
Does the name mean anything to you?
I advise you to mind your own business in future.
Is that understood?
- Cognac.
- Make that two.
I don't suppose you found out anything about General Carnaby.
I didn't get around to that. Thank you.
What were you and that major talking about?
I told him I was Himmler's brother.
Yeah, I could see why that would shake him up a little.
More than a little, I should think.
Keep an eye on things. I'll be back.
Take your clothes off.
- But I...
- Don't argue. Take your clothes off.
All right.
Now, relax. I didn't mean it that way.
You are going up to the castle tonight as...
Well, yes, as a domestic.
How? Naked?
Not a bad idea, but it's a bit obvious.
There's an acute staff shortage in Germany and the Schloss Adler is no exception.
You're the type they're looking for: young, intelligent, good-looking...
...and as we both know, not entirely without humor.
You must be mad.
If I wasn't, what would I be doing in this job?
Now listen very carefully.
You're supposed to arrive on a bus from Steingaden in about 20 minutes.
Your name is Maria Schenk.
You come from the Rhineland.
Here, give me that boot.
You've had TB and were forced to give up your job.
You have a cousin called Heidi who works in Zum Wilden Hirsch.
It's because of her that you got the job.
- Where are my identity papers?
- In that case...
...together with your travel permit.
Heidi will give you the rest later.
It must have taken time to prepare these things.
Very likely. Our Forgery Department did a special job on your papers.
But I thought General Carnaby's plane crashed only yesterday morning.
It was carefully arranged.
The plane was crash-landed in Oberhausen Military Airfield...
...about five miles from here.
It was riddled with machine-gun holes,
British machine-gun holes.
But what the hell?
A hole is a hole is a hole, as they say.
Are you trying to say that you'd risk the life of an American general...
...and all the plans for the second front?
- Of course not.
Give me the other boot.
I'm in a hurry to get to the castle...
...before they find out they haven't got General Carnaby.
The chap they've got knows no more about the second front...
...than I know about the back end of the moon. He's an American corporal.
His name is Cartwright Jones.
He's an ex-actor, probably second-rate...
...but he's the dead spitting image of the general.
Did you talk this poor man into getting involved with all this?
I didn't have to. He volunteered.
What actor wouldn't?
If he pulls this off, it'll be the summit of his professional career.
Mind you, it might be a short engagement.
Yes. A one-night stand.
Ah.
Well, here we are.
Mary, now Maria, this is your cousin Heidi.
Leave this behind in case you're searched.
Heidi will tell you what to do from now on.
She's been one of our top agents in Bavaria since 1941 and...
What a disguise.
So he left three minutes after me...
...in a hurry, you say, so he wasn't after me.
Any of the others leave?
Not that I could see, but this place is so crowded...
...and there are several other exits.
Any one of them could have slipped out.
You better start playing it straight or you can deal me out of this mess.
Now, we both know that radio operator wasn't killed in any drop.
Now, with MacPherson dead, there's only five of us left.
You either let me know what's going on or there's only gonna be four.
All right, lieutenant.
This morning you asked me why you, an American, was on this mission.
Well, the answer is really very simple.
Maria.
Oh, my dear Maria, you came after all.
My dear cousin Heidi, how wonderful to see you after all these years.
Gestapo. I am so happy to see you.
May I introduce you to a friend of mine?
Major Von Hapen.
My cousin Maria Schenk.
Your cousin told us to expect you,
Fräulein Schenk, but Heidi...
...you did not tell me she was as beautiful as this.
Thank you.
Perhaps when you're ready to take the cable car to the castle...
...I'll have the honor to escort you.
Thank you.
And I am going with her.
Oh.
Both of you, huh?
Well, then I am very fortunate.
Fräulein, until a little bit later.
This is a map of the castle.
And your instructions.
Do your homework well.
He doesn't seem to be anywhere in here.
Wonder where the devil he's got to.
I gave orders that nobody should leave.
Shall I go outside and take a look?
Attention. Nobody make a move.
Against the wall, please.
Against the wall.
Attention.
We are looking for four or five
Alpenkorps deserters from Stuttgart.
To escape, they killed two officers and a guardroom sergeant.
They were last known to be heading this way.
Clever. Very clever, indeed.
I want the senior officers of Drafts 13,
14 and 15 to come forward at once.
Check their papers.
Well, gentlemen, any suggestions?
Lieutenant?
Well, I think we'll stand a lot better chance outside than we will in here.
Agreed.
Gentlemen, see you after the war.
These papers are from the Fourth Panzer
Division stationed in Stuttgart.
When were they issued to him?
- Colonel.
- What is it, major?
Myself and the others are the ones you're looking for. We've come to surrender.
Lieutenant, take the three men away for questioning.
The officers will come with me.
Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Major Von Hapen.
Yes, sir.
Fräulein.
It's just my shoelaces.
- Need to get rid of this thing.
- Yeah.
Over the cliff. Let's push.
Okay. Push.
Push.
And a little more.
Good evening, lieutenant.
This is Miss Schenk. Lieutenant Kernitser.
She is the colonel's secretary in charge of all the female staff.
Can I see your papers, please?
And yours, Fräulein.
Would you come with me, please?
- Perhaps I'll see you a little later.
- Thank you.
Do you find anything interesting, major?
I hear there was some excitement in the village tonight.
Oh, nothing very serious.
Just the arrest of five army deserters, that's all.
Not quite. Those were the orders that were put out.
But actually, they were five British agents dressed in German uniforms.
British agents? Why wasn't I informed?
I'm informing you now, major.
If you sent out the orders, colonel...
...then you must have known for some time...
...who they were and that they were in this district.
We called you in your office and in your rooms.
You were not there.
Colonel, I don't have to remind you, do I...
...that I am in charge of all the Gestapo activities in this area...
...and if there are foreign agents, then I am to be informed at once!
- You were not here, major.
- Then you find me, colonel.
My duty is to inform you, but not to search every gasthaus to locate you.
I know your duties...
...and your loyalties.
Let me remind you, major, that I'm a colonel in the SS...
...and not some lieutenant you can frighten with your threats!
Your military rank and position are obvious to me, colonel...
...and so are your attempts to discredit me with my superiors in Berlin.
If there is any discredit, you bring it upon yourself.
Good night.
- You better lock the door.
- Sure.
Here are all the things you'll need.
Automatic, field glasses, ball of string and lead weight.
- You put those things in there?
- A week ago.
- You knew all about this even then?
- Yeah. Good luck, cousin.
We may need these.
I guess it's occurred to you, the Germans probably know about all this stuff by now.
It did cross my mind.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.
Broadsword, sir.
Danny Boy calling Broadsword.
Come in, Broadsword. Over.
MacPherson murdered. Thomas,
Christiansen and Berkeley captured.
I'm effecting entrance within the hour.
Please have transport standing by. Over.
Pull out now, Broadsword.
Save yourselves. Over.
You must be joking. Over and out.
That is an order, Broadsword. Over.
Broadsword? Broadsword?
Broadsword?
He's gone, sir.
Damn it!
It's all my fault.
It's all our fault, colonel.
It was my idea.
Maybe I'm getting too old.
Maybe we're both too old.
Well, anyway, there can't be any doubt anymore.
The Germans have totally penetrated Ml6.
They know every move we make almost before we make it.
Where the hell are they getting it all from?
We handpicked every man for this mission.
- We have top security.
- Security?
That word has become a bloody joke.
We've got company.
- Open the window.
- All right.
Put the bag in the bus and see if you can start the engine.
- How's it going?
- Try to give it a start.
Right.
Yes. Captain Mueller, with three prisoners.
All right.
Leave this one behind and tie that one to the end of the rope.
Good God, that nearly killed me.
You shouldn't go on these insane missions.
You're getting too old.
I thank you for those few kind words.
The first time I've been hot since I was in this bloody country.
- You got a plan of the castle?
- Yes.
Well, fetch it for me, would you?
Why don't you give him a hand?
What for? He's perfectly capable of looking after himself.
If I could climb up on my own, why can't he?
First left down the stairs, third door.
Next right-hander takes us into the east wing.
Down again. Second left.
Telephone exchange.
You wouldn't mind giving me a hand, would you?
You seem to have a lot of women stashed around this country, major.
I'm sorry. This is Mary.
She's one of our group.
- Lieutenant Schaffer.
- Hello.
Hello, Mary.
Thank you.
Take the rope and the explosives to your room...
...and bring them with you when you come.
- How's it looking?
- It's quiet enough.
First thing we gotta do is cripple that helicopter.
They might try to fly Carnaby out in it.
I think we can handle that.
Hello?
- You the pilot?
Yes, sir.
Kommandant wants you on the phone.
It's in the radio office on the left, around the corner.
- Do you have a cigarette, lieutenant?
- Yes, sir. Of course.
- Rather cold, isn't it?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Well, that was quick.
Fear lent them wings, as the saying goes.
What do we do now?
I think we'd better see how
Cartwright Jones is getting along.
You are making things very difficult, Herr General.
- Very, very difficult, indeed.
There aren't any difficulties, major.
General Rosemeyer here hasn't forgotten that Germany's a signatory...
...to the Hague Convention.
I have not forgotten, but my hands are tied.
I have my orders from Berlin.
You can tell Berlin all they're entitled to know.
I'm General George Carnaby,
United States Army, RA 123-025-3964.
And one of the chief coordinators of planning for the second front.
Which second front is that?
Well, general, I have done all I can.
I have tried to hold up the Gestapo.
I've persuaded the High Command that the mere fact of your capture...
...will compel the Allies to alter their plans...
...but this, it seems, is not enough.
For the last time, may I request you to give us the information?
General George Carnaby,
United States Army.
The matter is in your hands, Kramer.
You know, general, we have drugs that will make you talk.
- We do not wish to use them, but...
- Scopolamine. Heh, heh, heh.
Where's that gonna get you, colonel?
There are other drugs too.
The lieutenant here is a trained nurse.
Excuse me.
Yes?
And they are who we thought?
Very good.
Yes. Yes, you can bring them up now.
Has there been any further information about the other two?
Well, keep me advised.
Some very interesting company coming up, general.
The drugs may not be necessary.
Don't you think it's time we make a move?
Any minute now.
Just be patient.
A moment.
Fräulein.
Did I disturb you?
- No, I was just going out.
- Well, then I am just in time.
- You wanted to see me, major?
- Naturally.
What about?
Well, nothing.
I just wanted to see you.
Now, that is not a crime, is it?
No.
It's very seldom we have so pretty a girl here.
Perhaps I can show you a little Bavarian hospitality.
Now, downstairs, we have an armaments room...
...which has been converted into the most marvelous café.
But my duties,
I have to see the colonel's secretary.
The colonel's secretary can wait a little while.
You and me, we have a lot to talk about.
- Such as?
- Düsseldorf.
- Düsseldorf?
- I was a student there for many years.
From 1929 to 1933.
To your health, gentlemen.
You are not drinking, general.
That's understandable...
...when your rescuers turn out to be, well, birds of a different feather.
And the return trip, gentlemen.
How was that to be accomplished?
- Through Switzerland.
- Mm-hm.
Then it should be quite easy for you to return to London.
A rubber dinghy across the Rhine, and then a short walk.
You'll be in Whitehall...
...reporting General Carnaby's transfer to Berlin before you know it.
Back to London? Are you mad?
Not with Smith and Schaffer still alive.
What do you take us for?
You will also, of course, be reporting the unfortunate demise of Major Smith.
- Is he dead?
We are not quite sure.
- It is being looked into right now.
- It's getting late.
- Please remember the important issue.
- Yes, sir.
I think the situation has changed sufficiently...
...for you to give us the information we have been asking for.
Nothing's changed, colonel.
Most unfortunate.
Just a waste of good scopolamine.
Don't move, any of you.
Lieutenant.
No, I'd advise you not to, colonel.
Well, gentlemen, I'm glad to see you all here, safe and sound, enjoying a drink.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Lieutenant, drop that gun.
- What?
- Drop that gun and sit down.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Sit down!
- Major, if I live to be 100...
- Do nothing, lieutenant.
In your own idiom, you're a punk...
...and a pretty second-rate punk at that.
- If I might have some explanation...
- In good time, colonel. All in good time.
I was about to say scopolamine would have little effect on our friend...
...except to prove he's not General Carnaby, but a certain Cartwright Jones...
...an American actor impersonating General Carnaby.
- Who are you?
- Just a passer-by, as you might say.
In fact, I think the drug would probably work better...
...on our friends at the end of the table.
They're our real enemies.
- Don't listen to him, general. It's a bluff!
- Keep quiet!
Allow me to introduce myself.
Major Johann Schmidt.
SS Military Intelligence, Stuttgart.
- Can you prove that?
- Certainly, colonel.
Before I do, I wonder if you'd be good enough to call one of your guards.
I don't fancy talking and keeping my eye on these people at the same time.
Strange.
I seem to remember...
...that the cathedral was on the other side of the square.
Well...
Of course, I might be mistaken.
It's been a long time.
Oh, no, major.
I could have made a mistake.
I haven't been to Düsseldorf for three years.
It's very easy to forget.
Yes. It's very easy.
Fräulein, you seem to be a little bit distracted.
- Is anything wrong?
- No. No, it's nothing.
Just a slight headache.
I've had a long day traveling.
Oh, yes, of course. And here I am...
...I'm talking about silly things like Düsseldorf.
- You will forgive me?
- Of course.
Thank you. I tell you what.
We will have one more schnapps together and then I'll see you to your quarters.
- Thank you.
- Fräulein!
Well, now that we're all comfortable, the first order of business...
...is to find out exactly who everybody is and what they're doing here.
Now, first the lieutenant.
He's an assassin...
...a member of the American intelligence organization known as OSS.
His job was to shoot you, Colonel Kramer, and you, General Rosemeyer.
Now, General Carnaby's mission was twofold:
First, to allow himself to be tortured...
...into giving you the wrong plans for the second front.
And secondly, to afford the British...
...a perfect excuse to send in a team of experts to rescue him.
Which brings us to our three friends here...
...and the cleverest phase of the British operation.
- They are, of course, members of Ml6.
- That's a lie.
Let him finish!
Their job was to penetrate the German High Command...
...instead of the real
Thomas, Berkeley and Christiansen...
...who worked for us in London...
...and were discovered and captured by the British about a month ago.
That's another lie.
You can't prove any of this.
Can't I?
Any denials, lieutenant?
Now, General Carnaby, perhaps you'd be good enough...
...to give us your real name, rank and serial number.
Cartwright Jones, corporal, U.S. Army...
...RA 123-025-3964.
Thank you.
Having successfully substituted these three British agents for our men...
...what was the next phase of the British plan?
To penetrate the German High Command.
How? Simple.
Stage a fake air crash with a fake American general on board...
...send in special agents to effect his release...
...be sure that they fail in their mission...
...and these men would be taken to Berlin...
...where they would be right in the heart of the Wehrmacht.
And you, Major Schmidt, what were your orders on this mission?
To lead them in and make my own way out through Switzerland.
- But it... It's incredible.
- Yes.
But to the British, very, very simple.
You were going to give us some proof of who you are.
Certainly, general.
The proof is in three parts.
First, if I'm not who I say I am...
...what am I doing here?
What can I possibly hope to gain?
The rescue of an impostor, the exposure of three spies. Who to?
To the very people they're supposed to be working for.
I have nothing to gain.
Also, if these people are what they say they are...
...they would know the name of our top agent in Whitehall.
- Yes.
- So why don't we ask them?
They should know the man who sent them on this mission.
We all work through contacts.
It wasn't necessary or safe for us to know...
...where our orders were coming from.
Then I should be in the same boat as you, but I know his name and you don't.
Secondly, colonel, you have...
...one of the most powerful radio transmitters in Europe.
Put a radio telephone call through...
...to Field Marshal Kesselring's headquarters in Italy...
...and ask for his Chief of Intelligence, a Major Wilhelm Wilner.
Major. Major.
Major.
There's Colonel Kramer on the telephone from the Schloss Adler in Bavaria.
He says it's very urgent.
Major Wilner speaking.
Ja, colonel.
- Can you describe him?
- That will not be necessary.
Ask him to show you his right forearm.
- May I see your right forearm?
- Certainly.
There are two parallel scars, about three centimeters apart.
The scars are there.
Ask how did he get them.
- How did you get those?
- I was born with them.
He says he was born with them.
That is right. Then tell him he's a traitor.
Tell him he's a renegade.
That is Schmidt. No question about it.
- Thank you, major.
- Thank you, colonel.
Good night.
Give me the water.
As you know, the real Thomas,
Christiansen and Berkeley...
...while working for British counterespionage...
...were responsible for setting up an excellent chain of agents throughout Britain.
Now, if these men are who they claim to be...
...it would be reasonable...
...to expect them to be able to write down a list of those agents.
You could then compare their lists with the genuine one...
...which I have in this book.
- There's something very wrong, colonel.
I don't doubt who Schmidt is, but there has been some mistake.
Yes, and you're the ones who have made it.
Fräulein, would you be good enough to get some pencils and some notebooks...
...and we'll soon find out who's speaking the truth.
Good night, Maria.
You are a most charming girl.
Good night and thank you.
We must get to know each other a little better.
- Yes.
- Good night.
Good night.
Any one of these will do.
Now compare it with my original.
Guard!
Stay as you were, gentlemen.
Just relax.
Second-rate punk, huh?
All I could think of on the spur of the moment.
- Thanks. That even makes it worse.
- Sorry.
Well, between them, they shouldn't have missed anything.
This is all you want. Those books?
- Lots of nice names and addresses.
And these men?
Then they are who they claim to be?
I'm afraid so. They've been under suspicion for some time.
Classified information was going out and useless information was coming in.
It took several weeks to pin it on the departments controlled by those men.
But we knew we couldn't prove it.
Even if we could...
...what we really wanted was the names of their contacts.
These names and addresses.
So we thought this plan up.
And Wilner,
Kesselring's Chief of Intelligence?
He truly believes me to be one of his top agents in Italy.
I've been feeding him useless, false and out-of-date information for a couple years.
- All right, gentlemen...
Stay where you are!
I'd advise everyone to keep perfectly still.
Drop your gun, major.
You too, lieutenant.
By the fireplace.
Thank God you're here.
We were just about...
Sit down, colonel!
Everybody remain as he is...
...until I find out what exactly is going on here.
What do you mean?
Surely, you can see what's...
Sit down, colonel.
It's perfectly simple.
The lieutenant and myself...
...have uncovered a plot to assassinate the Führer.
- This is preposterous!
- General!
Sit down.
These people were all involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the Third Reich.
In my pocket here,
I have the names of all the conspirators.
Just before you interrupted us, we put this entire party under arrest.
The list in his pocket are the names of German agents working in Britain!
I don't expect you to believe me, major.
But you'll certainly believe these names if you'll permit me to show them to you.
Let me see them.
Careful, major.
Go very slowly.
Bring them here.
Smith.
All of you, get up! Stand over there.
Put your hands up.
Put your hands up!
Jones, see if you can find something to tie them up with.
Mary, bring that bag over here.
- What do we do with these three?
- We take them with us.
You were late.
- One day I won't come at all.
- Keep your eye on those three.
Lieutenant, in the next 15 minutes...
...we have to create enough confusion to get out of here alive.
Major, right now you got me about as confused as I ever hope to be.
The armory's here.
If we blow it up, the castle will think...
...it's being attacked by a division.
On the other side of the castle over here is the radio room.
I'll take the others and meet you there.
You take the map.
Mary, we're going.
Let me make myself perfectly understood.
If any of you utters a word, I'll kill you all.
You understand?
- Jones, get the major's gun. Now move.
- Yes, sir.
Move!
Go!
This way.
Jones.
Wait. Go back. Jones, go on.
Mary, get in. Get in there.
At ease.
Hello.
Get them in.
All right, inside, quickly.
You may need this.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
- We got company.
- Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Get the rest of the men out of here and report to the Kommandant.
Danny Boy calling Broadsword. Over.
Everything ready.
We need transport. Understood?
- Over.
- Understood.
Do you have it? Over.
We have it. We have it all. Over.
All sins forgiven.
Damn it.
Get Thomas out of there. Quickly.
Now!
Get out. Climb out.
Get on with it!
Grenades.
Corporal!
Outside! Out! Out!
All right.
Lieutenant, get the rope.
Back. Get back.
All right, to the right.
Quick. Move it.
Damn! Blast it!
Get moving.
All right. Get those men untied.
Better put those coats on if you don't want to freeze to death. Quickly, now.
Christiansen.
Jones, get them out. Mary.
Watch them. Right.
- The doors to the corridor are locked.
- See what winch controls they have.
- There's a stop and start button.
- See if you can make the motor work.
Not bad, huh?
- Yes, good.
Now bring it down here and we'll get on top, and you can take us back inside.
- Mary, bring them out here!
- Go on.
Get ahold of the rope and climb down.
Climb down!
Look out!
Schaffer?
Schaffer? Schaffer?
We've got him, Smith! Now, listen, Smith.
I'll make a deal with you.
You let us go down in the car and we won't kill Schaffer.
Smith!
You bring him out so I can see he's still alive.
I'm bringing him out now.
Get in the car.
Give me that.
Damn it!
Up there. Get him!
Help me. No.
No. No!
Help me.
Please.
No!
Lieutenant.
- Where's the major?
- He's on the cable car.
Jones, the bag.
Let's go.
Set the bombs to go off in three and a half minutes.
- Almost ready?
- Almost.
Jones. Mary.
All set.
Go.
- Twenty-five minutes. Can we make it?
- We can make it.
- Point is, will they?
- God knows.
Everybody on the floor.
Emergency. Get me the Oberhausen Airfield immediately.
- We've got company.
- Yeah, I saw them in the mirror.
How long before we reach the poles?
Just around the next turn.
Oberhausen Airfield?
Give me the Kommandant's office.
Get ready.
Set the rest of them and get out of here.
Oberhausen control tower.
Oberhausen control tower.
Oberhausen control. Over.
I'm in serious trouble.
Request urgent permission to land. Over.
Identify. Over.
Leutnant Ulrich.
Third Jaeger Junker squadron on night navigational exercise.
One engine out. Losing altitude. Over.
You are cleared for immediate landing. Over.
Coming in. Over.
Fighter Wing 126,
Oberhausen Airfield calling. Over.
Fighter Wing 126, Ober...
Get the control tower.
Come in... Aah!
Get down.
- Berkeley wrote these names?
- Yes, sir.
Ted Berkeley. I can't believe it.
And Thomas. And Christiansen.
All three of them?
- My God, it's incredible.
- Yes, quite.
But not as incredible as the one name that's missing from that list, colonel.
What name is that, major?
I have it in this notebook here in my pocket.
Earlier tonight, I showed it to Colonel Kramer.
He agreed with me that this was the top German agent in Britain.
It's your name, colonel.
Don't look so shocked.
Surely, you suspected it.
Otherwise, why were you here to meet us?
In case you were found out?
Go on.
You see, you underestimated
Admiral Rolland.
He'd suspected you and the others for some time.
He brought me and Mary back from Italy because we were the only two...
...in his department that he could trust, yourself included.
He asked you to choose a leader for this expedition.
You chose me because you knew from German intelligence...
...that I was a double agent.
Admiral Rolland knew I was not.
But for you, I was the perfect choice.
- Now you're guessing, Smith.
- No guesswork, colonel.
Your pointing that gun at me is sufficient evidence.
You are pointing it at me, aren't you?
Go on.
Mary was brought on the mission without your knowledge because I needed her...
...to get me into the castle.
The lieutenant, being an American...
...had no possible connection with Ml6...
...and was the only member of the group
I could trust.
I wasn't even sure of
Harrod and MacPherson...
...until they were killed by the others.
Fascinating. Very fascinating.
Perhaps even true.
- Assuming for a moment...
- You're finished, colonel.
- You're overlooking something, aren't you?
- Not at all.
Admiral Rolland took you to the plane himself, didn't he?
He also made certain that you had that gun, didn't he?
We took the precaution of removing the firing pin before the mission started.
Put it down, colonel.
Not so hasty, lieutenant.
We mustn't cheat the hangman.
What now, major?
You'll be tried for treason.
A public trial would be embarrassing.
Painful, not only for myself...
...but also for British Intelligence and Admiral Rolland.
Perhaps, but not as painful as that long drop to the end of the rope.
Well...
...I seem to have no cards left to play, do I?
No, colonel, you don't.
- Do I have an alternative?
- If you want it.
Mm.
Thank you.
I'll have those books.
Well, is that it, major?
Yes, that's it, lieutenant.
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time you have one of these things, keep it an all-British operation.
I'll try, lieutenant.
And you've come here directly from Normandy?
Ja wohl, ja, ja.
And how is the morale of the combat troops?
It's excellent.
You mean that?
Ja, ja.
Please.
Ah. That's where the attack against the Fuhrer took place... right in there, only three weeks ago.
The bomb was placed under the table.
It was in a briefcase.
The generals thought everyone would be killed, but the Fuhrer was safe, thank God.
General Jodl is waiting.
Please.
General Jodl.
Heil Hitler.
Very pleased to see you again.
The Fuhrer wants to see you immediately.
Be careful when you shake his hand.
Oh, then he was wounded.
Not badly; merely a scratch.
Nothing serious.
Nervous?
Ja.
Quite naturally.
Mein Fuhrer.
Noch nicht, mein Fuhrer.
Thank you, mein Fuhrer.
Thank you, mein Fuhrer.
Ja wohl, mein Fuhrer.
Herr Choltitz, at last.
I am so glad they sent you here.
You can't imagine.
As you know, I've been appointed your successor.
Paris is now a fortress city.
I am in full command, and unfortunately, it will not be an easy assignment.
Now, allow me to introduce to you some of my staff officers.
Colonel Jay you know already,
General von Boineburg,
Chief of Staff, and my adjutant... he will serve you well.
Please report to me at
6:30 tomorrow morning at my headquarters in the Hotel Meurice.
At 7:30, I want all the officers for a staff meeting at which we will study a plan for the defense of the city of Paris, street by street.
Is that clear?
Ja wohl, Herr General.
Then I won't disturb you any longer, gentlemen.
My God.
Gentlemen, you have heard which way the wind's blowing.
Well, what's wrong with you?
Are you drunk?
Have you forgotten how to salute?
Look at this uniform.
It's disgusting.
It looks as if you've been sleeping in it.
Why don't you mind your own business?
It is my business...
I am an officer, and you are a soldier in the Wehrmacht.
That's my bad luck, isn't it?
Haven't you heard?
We've lost the war.
Germany's finished. Kaput.
We've had it.
Stand up.
Papers.
What you need is a few days in prison.
You're a disgrace to Germany.
Museum is closing.
All right, we are closing.
Sorry, monsieur, we're closing.
The exit's right there.
Closing time, monsieur.
Ja, I'm leaving.
600 rifles to free Paris.
Where are the arms and ammunition promised by General De Gaulle?
They'll arrive very soon.
Soon? We need them right now.
I should get a message this evening.
London will tell us when the Allies will arrive in Paris.
If they don't decide to go around the city.
We'll have to wait if they do.
Tell that to our men.
Bernard Labe could tell them, and they would listen to him.
But he's in prison.
We have to free him.
I know only one way.
This is the center of Warsaw.
It was here that the Polish terrorists first fired on German troops.
As a result, the Fuhrer ordered the complete destruction of the city.
A lesson not only to the Poles, but to the world.
Your husband's alive.
In Germany?
No. In Paris.
He's to be transferred to the prison at Fresnes with a large group of political prisoners.
Fresnes.
That means they'll send him to Germany.
Yes.
Warsaw no longer exists.
And it will never exist again.
So perish all enemies of the Reich.
Enough of these horror pictures!
Keep quiet, I want to watch.
If you like it so much, why don't you go to Germany?
I didn't do anything, I swear.
I'm telling you, it's a mistake.
Day after tomorrow at Place des Vosges.
That's how we're planning to set them free.
That's premature.
An uprising can't succeed without support from the Allies.
In that case, they'd better hurry.
In the last four years,
I've changed my address ten times.
I've changed my name.
Today, our men are like me.
Impatient to come out in the open.
Impatience was never a good argument for anything.
German morale is low.
We ought to strike right now.
De Gaulle is in London.
If he were in Paris, he'd see things differently.
For the Germans, the
Resistance is an enigma.
Soldiers without uniforms or training.
They're convinced that we've got them outnumbered.
That's to our advantage.
Anyway you measure, the decision can come only from the National
Council of the Resistance.
Yes, we know that.
So call a meeting, but I'm sure they will agree with me.
Think what happened to Warsaw.
If you start too soon, you'll find you've only liberated ruins.
My name is Eller.
I was just parachuted from London.
Thanks, that's a good job.
Please, Sister, would you go get the last messages while I'm decoding this one?
The Allied high command has decided to bypass Paris.
They're going straight to the Rhine.
This is terrible.
As General De Gaulle's military delegate, you are ordered to avoid an uprising at all costs.
But how can I possibly control all the other groups of resistance?
What can I say to them?
Just be patient, relax, and one of these days the Allies will show up?
We must convince the Allies to help us.
Amicol, do you think with a bit of pressure from intelligence service they might change their plans?
My friend, all I'm supposed to do is to get information.
And I do, believe me.
The decision is part of strategy.
They must save all of their fuel to push their way to the Rhine and before Hitler can regroup his troops.
There's only one solution.
I have to go to London.
Then in your absence I will do everything that is in my power to avoid an uprising.
You can't prevent it without any help.
Bernard Labe.
Only he can help us now.
Would you please do me a favor and get me a cup of coffee before I collapse?
I'm afraid you'll have to collapse.
With the new commander, no more coffee breaks.
It's all work and no play.
Austerity till victory.
Just on the front.
Let's not exaggerate.
Reporting for duty,
Herr General.
You are seven minutes late this morning.
I'm sorry, Herr General.
Issue a proclamation to the population of the city of Paris.
Print it immediately.
Should any civilians shoot at a single German soldier, the entire block in which the shot was fired will be razed to the ground.
Do you have such a good memory you don't need to write down what I'm saying?
Yes, Herr General.
I mean, no...
I mean, no, Herr General.
Number two... issue an order to disarm the entire city.
Number three...
I want a plan for the destruction of important strategic points in case we're forced to fight in the city.
To ensure our defense.
Number four... a plan to destroy the entire city in case we're forced to withdraw and retreat to the Rhine.
Destroy the entire city?
Ja.
Any objections?
But is Paris of any strategic importance?
Is there any point in turning the city into a heap of rubble?
Cable Berlin... ask for the arrival date of Captain von Ebernach and his demolition squad.
Also the arrival date of Karl.
"Also arrival date of Karl."
What is his last name, sir?
Hmm?
Oh, ja.
Here, look at this.
That's Karl there.
No, not this one.
Here, look.
A giant mortar.
A beautiful toy.
When old Karl spits out a shell, a city block is erased.
You see that man?
Gives you an idea of the scale.
Ja?
You have lovely children,
Herr General.
Ja.
When you're finished, report back to me.
Ja wohl, Herr General.
Tomorrow morning, the Gestapo will transfer Bernard to Fresnes.
He'll only stay there two or three days.
Oh, if I'd only known.
Do you realize it was the morning the Gestapo arrested Bernard that I found out he worked for the Resistance?
He never knew I was working for them, too.
Each of us kept it a secret.
You might as well tell me the truth.
Were his responsibilities important?
His district covered all of Paris.
More than that, he had respect and admiration of the entire Resistance.
Now there's talk of insurrection, and your husband is one of the few men who can influence Colonel Rol, persuade him to wait.
Bernard is very important to us.
Then... you've got a plan?
Can you get Bernard out?
I have to go away on a mission.
I'm afraid you have to do it without me.
How? Tell me.
Go see Nordling, the Consul General of Sweden.
He's already negotiated for several prisoners.
The cost is high, 20 Germans for every Frenchman, but it's our only hope.
Nordling.
I'll go see him.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
See you after your dance class.
Pardon.
And where are you going, Madame?
I must see Consul Nordling right away, sir.
No, that's impossible.
I'm sorry.
- It's very urgent.
- Can you come back?
It's important.
I've got to see him.
Have you an appointment,
Madame?
It's a matter of life and death.
No, no.
Well, I'm very sorry, but I must ask...
It'll only take a few minutes.
Now, I promise.
Please let me see him.
What's going on here?
Herr Consul Nordling, my name is...
She's trying to force her way in.
What can I do for you, Madame?
Oh, Mr. Nordling, I'm terribly sorry to disturb you, but my husband is in the prison at Fresnes.
Madame, there are 2,980 political prisoners in Fresnes.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Oh, but Bernard is a very important leader in the Resistance.
Bernard Labe.
His work is important.
Bernard.
Bernard Labe.
Races horses, has the lovely place in the country?
Yes.
I've been there.
Madame Labe, you-you don't remember me.
I came with a large company.
You were very charming.
I... I particularly remember the lunch.
There was a marvelous mousse.
Mr. Nordling, you're speaking of another century.
Oh, please, what can I do?
Well, the Germans, so far, have refused to exchange political prisoners.
However, there's a new commander, and it's... just possible.
Oh, will you see him?
Can you see him?
I...
I will give anything.
Money, anything.
Trout.
What?
It was a mousse of trout.
That day at the lunch.
- Oh.
- Come on.
Where are they being sent?
Across the Rhine.
Buchenwald.
Buchenwald.
Oh, Buchenwald, oh, Buchenwald.
They're sending the French prisoners to Germany, and we stay here.
Why the easy way when they can make things hard?
Papers, please.
These are the plans for destroying the most important factories.
Herr General, the Swedish
Consul Nordling is here.
He wishes to see you immediately.
No, I can't now.
I gave specific orders that my conference with Captain Ebernach was not to be interrupted.
Consul Nordling insists it's very urgent.
He'll have to wait.
Ja wohl, Herr General.
Are these the plans of the factories?
Ja wohl. Over 200,
Herr General.
The bridges. 48.
The electrical works.
The reservoirs.
The gas works.
In five minutes, the entire city's totally destroyed.
How long will it take your men to place the explosives?
48 hours.
Good.
Herr General, are we also supposed to destroy the historical monuments?
The Notre Dame?
The Louvre?
Everything.
But not before you receive my personal order.
Ja wohl, Herr General.
This is the greatest assignment the Fuhrer has ever entrusted to me.
To destroy an entire city.
Well... we've had enough practice, haven't we?
Ja wohl, Herr General, but never on such a scale.
You're right.
With Paris, the eyes of the world will be upon us.
But don't forget, huh?
You are not to begin any demolition without receiving written orders from me.
I understand, Herr General.
That will be all.
A beautiful city, Herr General.
Ja.
I suppose so.
But we are soldiers, not tourists.
Send in the Swedish Consul.
Ja wohl, Herr General.
- Herr Consul.
- General.
What can I do for you?
General... it is my desire that the prisoners camps be conducted according to the Geneva Convention.
In order that we may avoid such massacres as have already occurred in Cannes and Fresnes.
That's a political concern, not military.
What happened?
I have a signature.
You do?
I can't believe it.
We have a chance.
Hotel Majestic.
- Oh...
- The prisoners...
Oh, that's marvelous.
May be turned over to the Red Cross if I can get a countersignature from the military governor.
51 is the first bus.
47 is the second bus.
49 is the third bus.
64 is the fourth bus.
Very well.
We shall hold the remaining prisoners until the Red Cross arrives to take them into custody.
Thank you, Major.
Excuse me, I-I wonder, do you happen to have a bit of brandy?
I'm feeling... rather faint.
It must be the heat.
I'm sorry, Consul General.
I do not drink spirits.
But here's some water.
Water's far better for your system than fermented grain.
I couldn't agree with you more.
Major...
I believe that some prisoners are already at the railroad station preparing to leave.
Ja.
2,453 to be exact.
Isn't that a list?
There must be some way to stop them.
They are no longer under my jurisdiction.
Once we deposit them at the station, they belong to the SS.
We don't have trains to repatriate our own wounded home.
And these SS pigs find them to transport prisoners.
There must be some way of releasing these prisoners.
From the SS?
Well...
I suppose you can always try.
I have my orders, which I have conveyed to your group leader.
I advise you to listen to him.
Very attentively.
To avoid any misunderstandings.
Is that clear?
Uh, group leader.
Group leader!
Tell your men what they can expect.
They say that we'll all be executed if anybody escapes.
So there's no use trying to run away.
They'll catch you, and shoot the rest of us.
Papers?
I want to see the Kommandant.
The Kommandant?
Let him pass.
Herr Kommandant.
I have an order from the...
Inside.
Inside!
Inside!
For God's sake, will you stop waving your damn papers in front of my nose?
I don't care in the least what's stamped on it.
Herr Kommandant...
I have orders to send these pigs to Germany.
This has been signed...
Bernard!
Bernard!
I've got the papers!
You are free!
Bernard!
Bernard!
Bernard, I've got the papers!
You are free!
Bernard!
Bernard!
- By general...
- General who?!
General this, General that,
General here, General there...
General damn! Since they tried to kill the Fuhrer,
I don't care about generals anymore.
They're all traitors.
What are you doing here?
How did you get past the roadblock?
What is this?
What's going on?
Why can't you keep any order?
Who is that woman?!
Herr Kommandant, she is under my protection.
- Swedish?
- No, but...
Then get her out of there!
Bernard!
Bernard!
Bernard, you are free!
No! No!
Bernard!
Bernard, no!
No! No! No!
No, Bernard, no!
No!
Bernard!
The Germans have disarmed the police stations at Saint-Denis and Duniere.
As a protest, the entire police force has gone off duty, but the Commissioner of Police ordered them back to their posts.
Will they obey the order?
No. No.
I can't give any orders to the police, but our operation would certainly be much easier... if the police were to stay on strike.
Yes?
It fits in with our plans.
The Resistance units of the police will decide tonight when they meet with the other sections.
I'll be at the meeting.
I'll talk to them.
The leader of the student Resistance was contacted by an agent called Serge.
He said he could get them rifles and ammunition.
How was the student contacted?
By one of his friends.
Says he works for intelligence service.
A favorite trick of the Gestapo.
It's out of the question.
All arms and ammunition must come through us.
Yes, but when?
Very soon.
A little patience.
What did Rol say?
We have to cancel it.
It's too risky.
But that's crazy.
I know Captain Serge.
He can be trusted.
No. It's no.
Oh, but I swear, he told me that...
- It's no use, Paul.
- He promised!
It's no use, Paul.
Colonel Rol says no.
But when are we going to fight back?
Very soon, very soon.
Just be patient.
You come for the ammunition?
I'm Captain Serge.
We were sent here by Francois.
Good work.
You're the first ones.
It's all right; it's Serge.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.
Cigarette?
Oh, merci.
Thanks.
Oh, there they are.
They're friends of ours, from the same street.
I'm Captain Serge.
I'm Diane, Catholic Youth Party.
Young Communists.
Here's our driver.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Listen, it's ridiculous, all of us meeting in the middle of the street.
A perfect way to get caught.
Come on, let's go.
The ammunition is in a garage.
Why don't you follow me?
Yes, all right.
Hey, what are you waiting here for?
Hurry, let's go.
Have you got the merchandise?
I've got a big surprise for you, Konrad.
There are at least 30.
How's that?
Bravo.
Don't move.
All of you stay in the truck.
Hands up!
Nobody move!
All right, boys, game's over.
Get into position.
The rest of you, back.
Get them out.
Out!
Aah! No! No! No!
No, no, no!
Not me, not me!
Aah!
Come on, get out!
They killed all of them?
All of them, and no trace of this Serge.
Apparently a Frenchman working for the Gestapo.
I tried to warn them.
The poor kids.
And the strike?
How about the police?
It's done.
They've voted.
Good. And now it's up to us.
Next time, it will be more than posters.
Over there.
Tear them down.
All of them.
Damn French swine.
Any news of Chaban?
The only thing I know is that he's left London.
Will the Allies head for Paris?
I know as much as you do.
Pierreflot, you are late.
I am sorry.
They are all over town.
"Paris fights back."
Hmm, Colonel Rol's been busy, hasn't he?
Mm-hmm.
Apparently, the liberation has begun.
We should have acted first.
Look here, you represent
General de Gaulle in Paris.
What do we do now?
We don't have very much choice, do we?
You sent for me?
What is the latest report?
We have received word from Chabon.
He has returned to Paris.
Chabon's returned.
I must see him before curfew.
We'll call a meeting of the
National Committee tomorrow.
We must move against the Germans before Rol.
We must take the prefecture of police.
It's the nerve center of Paris.
Between now and tomorrow?
The list!
Claire.
Yes?
Mademoiselle, please take this list of names to the mailbox.
The section heads will have all night to notify their agents.
Yes.
May I help you, mademoiselle?
Oh, la, la.
Don't bother.
But curfew is starting in a few minutes.
Permit me.
Ah.
It's not, it's not working so well.
I think it's broken.
I'm sorry.
I have to go home now.
In that case, permit me to take you in my car.
Why, it's very nice of you to help me.
Oh, you simply have no idea how helpful you really are.
Where were you?
What are you doing in uniform?
Well, I saw a circular saying that we should go back to work.
But that's a lie.
The National
Liberation Committee announced they'd dismiss any policeman who puts on his uniform.
Look at us, we're not in uniform.
The orders are to go to the prefecture
But that means they're trying to divide us.
Let them try.
Well, you mustn't come here,
Monsieur Labe.
Things might get dangerous.
That's just the point.
I thought that you might need a chaplain.
Yves Bayet, all your instructions arrived last night.
Everything's working out as we planned.
That's fine. Perfect.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Yes, I'll see you later.
Say, do you think that...
Quiet.
Quiet!
In the name of the Republic, and of General De Gaulle,
I'm taking possession of the prefecture of police.
I never gave orders to take the prefecture.
Looks like somebody else gave the order for you.
Tell our men to go into action immediately.
I'll see what's happening.
Mama!
Take a look down there.
Oh, thank God it's all over.
Jean-Pierre Guillom, do you take Lillian Ceverat for your lawful wedded wife?
I do.
Lillian Ceverat, do you take Jean-Pierre Guillom for your lawful wedded husband?
I do.
Then it is with great pleasure that I pro...
Take off that sash, monsieur.
You're no longer mayor.
Then we can't be married?
The ceremony will continue.
Congratulations and best wishes to you both.
Monsieur Luizet, in compliance with instructions from General De Gaulle,
I'm handing over the prefecture.
- Bayet.
- Yes?
It's Joliot Curie.
You mean... ah.
Ah, excuse me, uh...
Joliot Curie.
Bayet.
Delighted.
Take me to the wine cellar, please.
- The wine?
- That's right.
Go and show the professor the wine cellar.
It's across the courtyard.
Thank you, monsieur.
Don't mention it.
Empty all the wine bottles in the cellar.
Careful.
Easy with the suitcases.
They've got acid in them.
We'll make beautiful
Molotov cocktails.
Even the chateau margot and the champagne?
Yes, except the magnums, they're too big.
The gasoline, the gasoline, hurry.
Attention.
Attention.
This is Colonel Rol talking.
I have a message.
As chief of the F.F.I. for the region of Paris,
I want to congratulate you all.
Thanks to you, the Germans are on the defensive.
That's just the beginning.
But there are far too many of you here.
All of you, except 300, go back to your district headquarters.
We will give you further instructions in due time.
The essential thing is, the Nazis see us all over Paris.
All right, go on.
I see Colonel Rol's found us.
Well, what counts is that we made the first move.
From now on, we are all in the same boat.
We are off to a good start.
The courthouses are occupied, at least 80%.
That's good work.
Now I'm going to check up on the police stations.
Colonel Rol, I have ten men, what shall we do?
Take a position on the riverbank.
But I have no rifles.
Well, go back to bed.
Don't shoot.
Wait till he gets closer.
Quick, the ammunition.
The rifles.
One for me.
Come on.
Here.
Quick.
Go on.
Well, what do we do with them?
Put them in the cellar.
I'm very sorry.
They didn't tell me we weren't allowed to drive across Paris.
You French, I'll kill you all!
I'll kill every one of you!
French pigs.
Take me to the Hotel Meurice!
Hotel Meurice!
What's wrong?
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What are you waiting for?!
My men are being burnt alive!
Come.
Have three tanks lined up in front of the prefecture right away.
And keep firing at it until every one of them surrenders.
What's more, alert the Luftwaffe at Le Bourget.
We'll need their support.
That will be all.
No. Stay here.
No, let me go.
Listen to me.
Come back.
Monique!
Watch out!
They're going to shoot at us.
Here come the tanks.
Tanks?
- Here come the tanks.
- Where are they?
On Quai St. Michel.
They're encircling us.
They sent a couple of shots through the windows.
Three men were killed.
Quick! Did you get the code through?
- Yes.
- Hurry, Mademoiselle.
- Get down.
- Watch out!
Open up!
It's the Red Cross!
Open the door!
It's the Red Cross!
Damn it!
Just when I was going to get my phone call.
The German...
Hello. German tanks are firing on the prefecture.
Hello.
Hello? We must have reinforcements.
Send every man who's available.
At Ile de...
Hello? Hello? Hello?
At Ile de la Cite.
You must... you must attack the enemy from behind.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello? Can you hear me?
Hello? H... Hello?
What did you...
Hello. What?
There's another call.
I'm sorry. Quickly.
He's wounded.
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Badly.
It's the Mayor of Paris, but he's wounded.
- Hello, hello.
- He's been hit.
Germans attacking.
Send reinforcements.
Hello? Yes.
Oh, quickly, quickly.
A doctor before he dies!
Diane.
What are you doing?
Don't you see he's dead?
What do you expect us to fight with?
Pen knives?
We've called all over town for ammunition.
They want us to give up the prefecture.
But that's impossible.
Physically and morally.
Absolutely impossible.
Now that we're here, we're staying.
Quick, hurry up!
So, that's the thanks I get for freeing those political prisoners.
And now that rebel at the prefecture wants a cease-fire.
Ha!
Never.
We exterminate all of them!
I promise you that by tomorrow they'll be no prefecture, no cease-fire, no palace.
We leave that to the Luftwaffe.
And if a bomb should miss?
A few bombs always miss, but others will hit the target.
It's the law of averages.
A bomb that misses... could hit...
Notre Dame.
Ste. Chapelle.
That's a thousand years of history turned to dust.
You're not the first one to tell me that.
Yesterday morning, the Mayor of Paris was here,
Monsieur Titinger.
Titinger?
And he said the same thing.
But what can I do?
I am a soldier, and I must obey the orders
I was given by the Fuhrer.
General... your enemy... is the Allied Army, not the people of Paris.
What you really care about is the defense of the city.
Hmm? Am I right?
Arrange for a cease-fire, and you'll have time to prepare that defense.
Report from the prefecture.
Our men are losing ground.
How's it going in Noilly?
Heavier resistance than we expected.
Order the Luftwaffe into action over Paris.
Herr General, the Allies have air superiority.
If we try daylight bombing, we'll lose the last planes that we've got left.
Then attack tomorrow morning before dawn.
The divisions from Denmark... have we had any word of them?
No, and I'm doubtful that we'll ever get them.
Then...
You, you will accept a cease-fire?
I must hold the bridges, and time is running out.
With a cease-fire,
I could gain time.
But you do the negotiating.
I don't want to be involved with it, understand?
Of course.
But if those people dare to shoot at even one of my men...!
Don't worry, General.
History will be grateful to you... for having saved a... very beautiful city.
Hello.
Susan?
Yes.
I'm fine.
I wanted to hear your voice.
Yes.
The children, how are they?
Give them a kiss.
Of course I do.
Don't worry, I will.
Yes.
No, no, don't worry.
No, please.
I don't even have any bullets...
We won! They're pulling out!
They're running away!
No, don't, please.
You mustn't.
Cease fire.
A cease-fire has just been concluded with the German Commander of Paris.
The National Committee of Resistance issued an appeal to all citizens of the Republic not to engage in any further reprisals or demonstrations of any kind.
In exchange, the German occupation forces agree not to attack public buildings now in the hands of the Resistance.
Furthermore, they agree to treat all French prisoners according to the laws of war in the Geneva Convention.
Cease fire!
A cease-fire has just been concluded with the German Commander of Paris.
How do you like that?
What's going on?
Those double-crossers used my name to order a cease-fire.
Now that the Germans are running, we're not going to quit.
I'm afraid we'll have to quit... no ammunition.
We'll find some.
Thanks to the cease-fire...
Thanks to the cease-fire we have already won, first of all, official recognition of this committee and of our forces in Paris.
Furthermore, we can avoid certain defeat, a crucial point.
You know perfectly well the prefecture would have been taken in an hour at most.
- And you know why, too.
- Yes.
Where was the ammunition?
Our delegation has demanded time and time again that the Allies give us arms and launch a spearhead on Paris.
We haven't received an answer.
I met General Patton myself.
He didn't say it in so many words, but it's clear that the Allies intend to capture Paris by encirclement.
It is up to us to remain where we are.
There's no choice.
We must keep the gentleman's agreement we made with Choltitz.
Choltitz.
With Choltitz, gentleman.
That's right. Choltitz.
I'm only concerned with saving the lives of our men and avoiding unnecessary killing.
For us, it's only a matter of deferring all combat until such time as the balance of forces swings in favor of the Resistance.
I see.
We sit on our behinds until the arrival of the Allies.
That is treachery!
It is you who are traitors!
It is impossible to discuss anything seriously under these conditions.
I'm leaving!
I propose we put it to a vote.
Raise your hands if you're voting in favor of a cease-fire.
All those who oppose it?
The cease-fire is rejected by one vote.
I will abide by the decision of the majority, but for tactical reasons,
I must request that our decision to resume fighting not be announced before tomorrow, 3:00.
Halt!
We must put on a show for them so act with authority.
Leave it to me.
Get out!
Hands up!
We are representatives of the Resistance.
A cease-fire was concluded with the General in command of Paris through the intervention of the consul of Sweden.
We are checking to make sure that it's respected.
We shall see.
Major, a briefcase.
Terrorists.
I'm sorry, this is serious.
Very serious.
You're obliged to respect the conditions of the truce.
You have to liberate us.
Go on, get in.
Quickly, get in.
They could be telling the truth, but I can't afford any more trouble.
I think I'd better check up.
I'm turning this over to the Gestapo.
I'll take the women in my car and you the men in yours.
Yes, sir.
Go on! Both of you.
I decided the only thing to do was to execute them, but then I thought you might want to speak to them.
Gentlemen.
I suppose you know the Swedish Consul,
Herr Nordling.
Thanks to his efforts, we arranged a truce which, up to now, has cost the lives of 200 German soldiers.
As a representative of General De Gaulle's provisional government,
I protest!
Against our arrest in the midst of the cease-fire.
We are just contacting our people to make sure they respected it.
In your car, my guards discovered a proclamation that was designed to provoke the city of Paris to revolt.
I don't see how you maintain you're respecting the cease-fire and then make vicious attacks on our men right in front of our faces!
I'm a member of the French
Government in Exile and I won't permit you to question my word of honor!
The circular in the car was a proclamation that had been revoked.
In that case, why did your men shoot at our soldiers?
You command an army of regulars.
When you give an order, your men obey it.
The Resistance is an alliance of many movements, and I don't control them all.
The Communists, for example?
Our ranks include both
Communists and anti-Communists.
Now we're all battling against a common enemy.
You can make among yourselves all the politics that you want!
Only you must not shoot at my soldiers!
If you would like to finish these incidents, stop sending out your patrols.
Herr Consul... since these men were taken prisoner after the cease-fire went into effect,
I place them in your custody.
Thank you, General.
Are you an officer?
Officer in the Reserves.
Well, then...
Get these men out of here before I change my mind.
Careful.
Well... now we're going underground and I mean literally.
We've taken most of the police stations and post offices.
Good, but remember, no matter what as long as the Germans are in Paris, the orders are to keep fighting.
It's right through here.
We'd better hurry.
He'll be calling any minute.
Hey, Maurice.
Here, German sweaters, underwear.
Ah! It's about time.
We're freezing here.
Take one.
Here, give this to Jean.
It's time.
Ja. Ja.
Everything's in order.
Heil Hitler!
What's going on?
The German watchman.
Every day for the last two years he's called to make sure everything's all right in the sewers.
Hello? Hello?
This is the main sewer station,
Place de la Concorde.
A Nazi tank is still patrolling.
Nothing else to report.
Everything's all right.
Somehow, we've got to make contact with the Allied Command.
I thought you were sending Veret.
He was killed.
He didn't even reach the front.
That makes six men we have lost.
And so we'll have to send out a seventh.
Maurice, you know the region?
I- I'm from Marseilles.
You know Normandy?
I've been there on vacation, but I can't say I know it very well.
That leaves it up to you,
I guess.
Will you do it?
Of course.
Dr. Monod has a car, a safe-conduct, everything.
He told me that you might get through by pretending you're going to inspect the hospitals in Normandy.
Sounds good.
Good.
But after you've contacted the Americans...
If I contact them.
Good morning.
These are your papers.
You're assisting me.
I'll let you drive the car.
Uh, tell me, know any medical terms?
No, nothing much.
Well, I'll have an intern at the hospital at Versailles come along with us.
It will help.
A good motor.
Ah. Old Marcie gave me a real gasoline.
- For you.
- Yes, who is it?
It's a man.
I can't hear him.
Hello. Yes? Yes?
It's Mantes! Yes!
The Americans are in Mantes!
The Americans are in Mantes!
Listen.
Y- You can hear tanks.
Listen!
Here, listen!
I can't believe it!
Hospital attendant.
There, you see?
Und he?
He's been assigned to us.
Why, yes, he's my assistant.
We're going to visit one of my patients at the sanitarium in Neufchateau.
The doctor and his assistant have an emergency call, and they'd like to go to Neufchateau by car.
Hey, what's going on over there?
Turn everybody back.
The curfew begins in 30 minutes.
Go on!
I'll have every one of you shot!
Halt!
Turn around!
What are you doing here today,
Monsieur Cocteau?
Good evening, monsieur.
It's nearly curfew.
Matter of fact, we've come to see you.
Oh, fine.
It's a pleasure.
Is it all right?
Of course. Certainly.
I'll open the gate.
Follow me.
So, that's your real name?
I hope you gentlemen will be comfortable.
Good night.
Good night.
Thank you, monsieur.
According to the farm boy, it's only 11 kilometers to the front.
He's willing to show me the way.
It's safer to go at night.
You mean you trust a farm boy you never saw before?
Why, you won't even make two kilometers in this rain, and with those shoes.
What if you meet a German patrol?
You can't say you are on your way to give a sick cow some medicine.
Listen, my friend.
To me, it's madness to ask the Allies to parachute arms into a city like Paris.
You realize... guns dropping all over the roofs, in the streets?
You know very well they might fall into anybody's hands.
But after all, it's my mission.
Well, instead of asking for weapons, say they should push immediately for Paris.
Impossible. My orders are...
Well, then, if that doesn't work, you must try and speak to Leclerc, all alone.
Why, returning to Paris... it's been his dream for four years.
Ooh.
I shouldn't have eaten those pig's feet.
To think I'm a doctor.
They always give me heartburn.
You'll never make it, believe me.
The woods are crawling with SS.
The roads are all blocked for ten kilometers.
What do we do now?
The morning's wasted, and we still can't get around the Germans.
Come on.
Major Georges.
Of course, that's it. Why not?
He's the head of the Resistance in Corbeil.
Hurry.
No, no, give me the ration ticket tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
Here, Pierre.
Take your bread.
There. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Thank you very much.
The Americans are at edge of the woods.
Then it's all right.
Good.
Well, I'll leave you here.
I must return to the hospital as soon as possible.
And the Germans?
The Germans?
At the other end of the village.
They've occupied a farm with guns behind each stack of hay.
Believe me, with them you mustn't use tricks.
You must show force.
It's the only method.
Let's go.
Is he the one?
Yes, it's him.
He wants to go over to see the Americans.
Well, we can try.
Seymour!
Watch the store.
I use them because of their uniforms.
The Germans have respect for uniforms.
Conditioned reflex.
I'll let you know when I get back.
I'm going, too.
You need support.
Go on.
Albert...
Yes or no?
Watch out for the machine guns.
Ready?
Ready.
Stop!
This is a good spot.
All right.
Hey, go on.
The Americans are across the field.
Well, good luck.
Thanks.
Get going.
Let him go.
If we shoot him, we'll give away our position to the Americans.
Hey... where did you come from?
I come from Paris with a message for General Eisenhower.
Here's the new call to arms.
Fine.
Where did you find that tin hat?
I stole it from a German sergeant while he was taking a nap.
You should've picked one that fit you.
Hey, why don't you bring a pillow along, too?
Here are the bullets.
Take them over to Colette.
I stole them from the bakery.
They had plenty.
We start out of Deburre, fly over Paris, back to the airfield, then start over again.
Herr General Field Marshal.
Please leave us alone for a minute.
It is quite clear that you are no longer able to keep order in the city.
And we've also learned that you've negotiated with the terrorists.
Herr General Field Marshal...
It's not your business to meddle in politics.
Why did you make the panzers leave their post at the prefecture?
I thought it more efficient to attack with the Luftwaffe.
Then please explain why you didn't use the Luftwaffe?
Because of the superior air strength of the Allies.
I discussed it with Major Hegel of the Luftwaffe...
I warn you, you must restore order by any method, however drastic.
Ja wohl,
Herr General Field Marshal.
If you don't follow my orders you know what the consequences are.
Ja wohl,
Herr General Field Marshal.
Heil Hitler.
Hell Hitler.
General Field Marshall Model.
Draw up a plan for the bombing of Paris.
Okay. Major Gallois.
I've been sent by Colonel Rol, the head of the
French Resistance for Paris, to tell you that we have seized half of the city.
And now we want you to...
You want what? Hmm?
We want you to help us.
The situation is this: we hold all the official buildings.
After one day's truce, fighting has started again, but we are short of arms and ammunition.
The Germans will find out sooner or later, and when they do, their reaction may be terrible.
Especially if they receive reinforcements from the east, as we are told.
They may destroy Paris.
So we ask you to send us one unit to liberate the city immediately.
You're a soldier,
I'm a soldier,
I'll give you a soldier's answer.
First, we're not in the business of liberating cities, not even capitals.
Our business is to destroy the German army.
We can end this war in three months if we keep moving fast.
Second, Major Gallois, don't you think that I would like to help you people?
Can't you see what my position is right now?
Third, we can't change plans that have been scheduled for months.
Final victory depends upon it.
Our plans don't include feeding four million
Parisians, hmm?
I'm sorry, Major, it's no dice.
I'll report our conversation to my superiors in Paris.
Sit down.
Orderly!
Yes, sir?
Open up a bottle of champagne.
- Champagne.
- Yes, sir.
Are you tired?
No, sir.
May I ask you a... a personal favor?
What is it?
I want to talk to a French officer, General Leclerc.
Mmm. Leclerc?
That impatient lion.
You mind traveling all night?
Of course not.
Good.
Here's one for the road.
Akerns?
Yes, sir.
Get a jeep and a driver for this man and see that he gets to Laval.
He needs to see General Leclerc.
Thank you, sir.
You got a long trip ahead of you.
Half the brass in Europe is at Laval, you know?
Hello? Hello?
General Bradley, please.
Good trip, huh?
Brad?
What the hell's happening in Paris?
Colonel Lebel, Major Gallois.
Colonel Lebel,
General de Gaulle's liaison, assigned to General Bradley.
General Patton telephoned to say you were en route.
Who?
General Patton.
You saw him at the front.
That was General Patton?
Yes.
General Leclerc is not here but, um, I...
I told the Americans you were coming, and they are very anxious to see you.
In fact, General Sibert will interrupt a staff meeting to hear your report.
This is our last chance to convince the Allies that they must go on straight to Paris.
It's up to you now.
Yes.
We're listening, Major.
The Resistance and the people of Paris now control most of the city.
We wanted to welcome you to a liberated Paris.
But we cannot hold out indefinitely.
We need your help.
The Germans have no organized units between your advanced lines and Paris.
From the military point of view, it would be a-a mistake, almost a crime, if you didn't take advantage of such a favorable situation.
It... it is only a question of time, gentlemen.
The Germans will counterattack, and they have precise orders to destroy Paris.
Hundreds of thousands of Parisians will be... slaughtered.
The French people will never forgive the Allies for not coming to their aid.
Never.
You're very eloquent.
As a matter of fact, what you told us is exactly what
General de Gaulle's been telling Eisenhower.
I'm contacting Bradley immediately.
You must send us a unit a once.
You can tell General Leclerc that I may have some news for him.
Leclerc? Is he here?
Yes, he arrives in a few hours.
Anyway, congratulations.
I think you made a good impression.
Come on, let's get something to eat.
You must be hungry, eh?
Please.
Here we can talk quietly.
Have a seat.
Your cease-fire didn't work out as you planned.
The situation is worse than before.
The Allies have crossed the Seine near Mantes, so if our information is correct, they'll encircle Paris shortly.
Then I must take drastic measures and begin the demolition of the city.
Really mean to destroy the city?
If that cease-fire of yours had worked out...
We did our best.
Nobody can control the Resistance now.
If de Gaulle were here...
Why doesn't anybody get in touch with him and ask his help?
With de Gaulle?
It's the only way Paris will ever be safe from destruction.
The Resistance is going to force my hand otherwise.
This is the final order
Hitler gave me.
Destroy the entire city of Paris.
Herr Consul, do what you can.
I've issued this for you: a pass that will get you safely through the German lines.
Why are you doing this?
Herr Consul, if I thought that the destruction of Paris could win the war for Germany,
I would set the city on fire myself.
But... we've lost the war.
Then... why has Hitler ordered the destruction of Paris?
Because he's insane.
I know it.
I saw him in Rastenburg.
There are two SS officers waiting for you.
Did you find anything?
No, Herr General.
Force of habit.
Well?
It concerns a mission that's rather delicate.
Well, isn't that the specialty of the SS?
Delicate missions?
Vice Minister Himmler has recently learned that the Louvre has a very valuable tapestry.
A what?!
A tapestry.
It's, uh... it's called the, uh... the Bayeux Tapestry.
11th Century.
It shows the Norman invasion of England.
The Vice Minister would like us to bring it as a gift for the Fuhrer.
Huh.
Instead of the real invasion of England.
I don't find that so amusing, Herr General.
Well, gentlemen, you can have the tapestry.
We were certain we could count on you, Herr General.
Only the Louvre is in the hands of the Resistance.
But the Louvre is just over there.
Ja. The only question is, will it still be there when we get through blasting it?
But why don't you try to bargain with the French?
Go with a white flag in your hand.
You never know. They could give it to you as a present.
Gentlemen, good day.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler!
We represent the ministers of the Provisional government.
The cease-fire has at least permitted us to occupy the buildings.
But we must make one more step toward installing the new government by holding a meeting of the new cabinet.
Let's say, at 6:00.
Right.
Then we'll have to take the Maintenon.
Pierrelot will take care of that.
The Maintenon?
Maintenon Palace.
Ah.
Traditionally, that's where all cabinet meetings take place.
I don't think there are any Germans there, but I understand that a group of collaborators are still occupying the building.
Do you think they'll try to keep us out?
We know that some of them are against us.
You never can tell.
Take 30 men along with you.
That should do it.
30 men, huh?
Well, I guess
I better get going.
Claire, start telephoning.
All right.
Gentlemen, see you at 6:00 for the cabinet meeting.
At the Maintenon.
Where else?
Hello? Is Marcelle in?
He's not there?
- Well?
- Nobody can go with you.
Did you reach Maurice?
He can't leave the office.
The Germans are guarding the street.
And Joliot?
At the town hall it's the same thing.
Well, I'll go alone.
I'll go with you.
Over there.
Go on.
Hurry.
Pardon, monsieur.
Yes?
Do you know where the Maintenon is?
Over there, monsieur.
The Prime Minister's house?
Oh, no, no, I'm sorry, across the Seine.
Rue de Varenne, yes.
Go on.
Rue de Varenne?
Oh, there's a sentry box in front.
You can't miss it.
And be careful.
They're shooting everywhere.
We'll get ourselves killed.
Come.
What do we do now?
Eh...
Let's go.
What do you want?
The officer in command.
Major, there is someone to see you.
I'm the officer in charge.
What do you want?
I have come to take possession here in the name of the Provisional
Government of the Republic.
Monsieur Le ministre, I've always been for the Republic.
I place myself at your disposal.
Thank you, Major.
Detail, fall in.
You forgot to put armbands on.
Attention!
Close ranks.
Present arms.
The staff welcomes you,
Monsieur Le ministre.
Thank you.
Take me to the Council Hall.
If Monsieur Le ministre will follow me.
Who are you?
Switchboard operator.
Go back to your switchboard.
And you?
Chief librarian, monsieur.
Return to your library.
The meeting starts in two hours.
How many will you be, monsieur?
Around 30.
Very well.
The Prime Minister's desk.
Ah, monsieur, I've seen governments come and go, but nothing like the last one.
They took everything they could.
Even the silverware.
And here is the Council Hall.
Not bad.
Would you please provide some pencils and erasers?
And ink and scratch pads.
In other words, the usual preparations for Council meetings.
Good.
And we will also need rooms for the night.
Bedrooms.
I assume Monsieur Le ministre will the want the Green Room for his personal use?
The Green Room?
It's always reserved for the Prime Minister.
My, my.
Hmm, adequate.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I know exactly how you feel, my son.
But no emotion.
The facts.
If you don't march immediately on Paris, they'll destroy the entire city.
The situation is as serious as that?
I'm afraid so.
You must begin your drive on Paris... tomorrow.
I should personally like nothing better.
And I'm doing all I can to convince headquarters, but you can't push an armored division around like a wheelbarrow.
We've just fought a battle at Argenton.
We're very far from Paris.
I could make it.
But I would have to receive the orders today.
And if not?
If not?
We'll see what we can do.
General de Gaulle will end up by convincing the Allies.
And now, tell me everything.
Well, where's General Bradley?
If he's not here before 7:00, it's going to be too late.
I've got to get that order before tonight.
Ah, here he is.
Well, I got the news
I was waiting for, Sibert.
Where is he?
You win.
The decision has been made to go into Paris, and the three of us hold the responsibility for that decision.
I, because I'm giving the order, you, General Leclerc, because you are going to execute it, and you, Major Gallois, because you brought us the information that led us to that decision.
Thank you.
How do you feel, Major?
Hmm? Oh, I haven't slept in three days.
I promise you a full day's sleep.
But right now
I'm sending you down to G-2, and tomorrow you can join General Leclerc at Ramboullier.
Rebius?
We're moving on to Paris.
Is that your son, Lieutenant?
He was two then.
And now he's four years old.
I've never seen him.
Off your behinds!
We're marching on to Paris!
I'd better shave off my beard before my wife sees it.
This is it.
We're going to Paris!
Dampierre!
That way, there.
Where are you going?
To Paris!
Paris?!
Well, you've still got a long way to go.
I have an aunt who has a restaurant in Montparnasse.
We can eat off her for ten years.
Is that near the Bastille?
Not the Bastille.
I said Montparnasse, peasant.
They signed off, sir.
Fine. Message finished.
Two German panzer divisions have started out for Paris.
Call all the other units.
We must notify them.
Go on, quickly, quickly.
Orders from the General.
All units accelerate.
Where is Leclerc now?
They're moving, they're going all out but they're still more than 50 kilometers away.
Mm. That's about 30 miles.
You know, we can't run the risk that German general might just suddenly change his mind and destroy the city.
So Leclerc has quite a job on his hands.
Tell Hodges to keep the Fourth Division ready just in case.
Look, the Eiffel Tower... that's on the... the right side of the river, right?
The Right Bank?
The left.
Well, okay, if the Eiffel Tower is on the left... that means that the Louvre is on the right, yeah?
And the Chambre of, what do you call it?
Of Deputes.
Now, look, will you just knock it off and quit bothering me?
Yeah, but you've been to Paris and I haven't.
Boy, I never thought in a thousand years
I'd get to see Paris.
Yeah. See Paris and die.
No, that's... that's Naples.
What do you think happens when you die?
You go to Naples.
Funny.
Start unloading those bazookas there, Sergeant.
We going into Paris, Lieutenant?
Yeah, we're moving out.
Oh! The telephone's working!
We can call Paris!
We can call Paris!
We can call...
Hey! The telephone's working!
We can telephone Paris.
Hey, Maurice, the telephone's working.
You can call your house.
Madame, please.
Put a call through for me to Elysees 3-2-2-6.
It's my parents.
My mother, Madame Bovera.
Tell her I'm coming with the Black Berets.
You've come a long way?
Yes.
Sahara.
Sahara?
Mama!
It's Mama.
It's me, Henri.
Put-put the champagne on ice.
We're coming!
How much do I owe you?
May I?
Of course.
Hello?
C'est beau l'accuell...?
Hold on, please.
Here you are.
Hello?
Hello, it's me.
It's me!
But it's true,
I tell you, it's me!
I say it's me. Me!
Tell her your name, it'll be quicker.
Huh?
All right, who are you?
Georges.
All right. Hello. It's Georges.
I mean, I'm not Georges.
I mean, yes, it's Georges.
I'm calling for Georges.
But he can't speak.
He's too excited.
Hey, Georges, we're leaving!
He's in Arpageon.
Tell her we're on the way.
On the way.
He's on the way.
Yes, and I give her a kiss.
He's on the way.
He gives you a kiss.
He loves you.
I love her.
I love her.
Good-bye, Madame.
Where have you come from?
From Paris.
Here are the locations for the mines.
Uh-huh.
Fine.
Then we move on to the next site.
One hour and it's all finished.
They're going to have such a show of fireworks, they'll think the whole world is burning.
We are going home to Berlin!
We are going home to Berlin!
We'll be back for Christmas!
Wait a minute, stop pushing.
General Leclerc asks me to tell you that they're on the march... to hold fast!
Hey, believe it or not, we're passing right in front of my house.
I live on the corner.
Our kitchen is just above the restaurant, and I used to get my cigarettes at the shop across the way.
You know, I said to my wife,
"I'll be back."
"I'm going to get a pack of cigarettes."
The funny part is,
I didn't go back.
I signed up with De Gaulle.
What will you tell your wife?
I've got the pack of cigarettes... Camels.
All right, on your feet.
Hurry, hurry.
What is it now?
You can come out.
Oh, about time.
What's going on?
You've got work to do.
Oh, work.
Yeah.
Hurry.
It's a tank.
55 meters. Direct target.
First, they put you in jail.
Then, they want you to defend it.
Fire. Fire.
What are you doing there, Daum?
We're joining the regiment, sir.
That's stupid.
Yes, but those are the orders.
You should never obey stupid orders.
Sir, they tell me there is a clear road ahead.
Good. You're starting immediately for Paris.
Don't worry about the Germans. Just go.
Don't stop for anything.
Tell the Parisians we're coming.
We'll be there... tomorrow.
Very well, sir.
Go on.
Daum!
Didn't I tell you to clean that up?
There was no time, sir.
In Paris we have to look our best.
Hey!
Who are they?
They're Germans.
No, they are Americans.
Get away from the window.
Juliet, come inside. Juliet!
Why, they're American.
The Americans?
It's the Americans!
The Americans.
No, they're French!
Oh, they are French.
They're French!
I can't believe it!
Say, what's the shortest way to the town hall?
It's very simple, Captain.
You take the Avenue de...
Take the Rue de la Piscine.
Thank you. Thank you.
Why are the bells ringing like that?
Herr General...
They're announcing our funeral, my dear Fraulein Irma.
Would you connect me with General Spiedel?
Put a call through to General Spiedel.
Why do you look so surprised, all of you?
You thought a miracle would save us, huh?
None of you seems to realize what's happening... in Russia, in Germany... or even what's happening now in Normandy.
After the past few months,
I don't think anything could surprise me.
General Spiedel.
Good evening, Spiedel.
There is something you should hear.
Bells?
Ja, they are ringing.
They've been silent for four and a half years.
They're ringing to announce the arrival of the Allies.
And now will you send me those divisions you promised us almost a month ago?
Unfortunately, no.
Our reserves are completely exhausted.
Ja, then, dear Spiedel.
I would appreciate you doing a favor for me.
See that my family doesn't suffer.
Thank you. Ja.
Hmm. Napoleon's tomb.
All his victories:
Marengo,
Austerlitz, lena,
Freidland,
Wagram,
Moscow.
Moscow...
Von Choltitz here.
The Fuhrer wants to know are you ready to proceed with the burning of Paris?
Of course, General Jodl, of course.
All the charges have been placed under the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower.
What are you waiting for?
Why the delay?
What's holding you up?
All the demolitions are set for the fortified bridges, for all of the waterworks.
Then I see no reason for you to delay any longer.
Give the order for total destruction.
The minute that all our occupation units have evacuated the city.
It should've been done already!
The Fuhrer wants the city burned now!
Is that clear?!
Do you know where my son is?
What's his name?
Maurice Bovera.
Don't know him.
Where are the Black Berets?
Over there.
Thank you.
Colonel Fabien.
We are ordered to support your attack on the...
Careful!
Lieutenant Delafu Chartiere.
Second division.
The only way to get those Nazis is to climb up there.
You see?
All right.
Marco, Jacques, you cover us.
- Yes, sir.
- Ready?
Lieutenant Pierre
Delafu Chartiere.
Second Armored Division.
My respects, Madame.
Oh, please, after you.
This way, please.
Oh, wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
You mustn't force it.
Careful.
They're over there, across the street.
Better step back, Madame.
I want a man at each window.
Yes, sir.
Ooh, careful.
Prepare the grenades.
Right here.
You, you got everything ready?
Careful, my roses there.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, please, please, Madame.
Oh, don't you worry about me.
Oh, don't worry...
Make sure they don't see you, huh?
Jacques, the incendiary grenades?
Ready, sir.
Good.
Marco, ready?
Ready, sir.
When I give the order, hit them with everything.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Ready.
Go on.
Perfect.
Fire.
Cease fire.
Close it carefully, huh?
Madame, thank you for your hospitality.
Gentlemen, would you pick up the cartridge shells?
Very well, sir.
My respects, Madame.
Madame.
All right, we'd better get going.
Madame.
We made it.
We're in Paris.
Yeah, we haven't made it yet.
We got to cross that bridge first.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Excuse me.
Ecole Militaire?
Oh, right.
It's there, to the right.
To the right,
Ecole Militaire, right?
Yes.
Please.
Come on. Come on.
Hey!
We've waited four years for you.
But America's only been in the war for three years.
So what?
We knew you'd come.
What's wrong?
Yeah, well, he's already got a date.
But I don't.
The Captain's looking for you.
There's a tank over there.
We've got to knock it out.
Stop.
Bombs are here. Come.
Over here.
Excuse me, sir.
Do you happen to have any bazookas here?
Yeah, yeah.
It so happens we do.
Make it fast.
Cover me, Charlie.
I'm going off with this guy.
Okay, but watch yourself.
We're on the Left Bank, right?
What?
Uh, the... the Left Bank.
Yeah, Boulevard San
Michele over there.
Jardin Luxembourg there.
Yeah.
Yeah, the Latin Quarter.
And, uh, that's not a nightclub either.
That's... that's where the students live, right?
Yeah, I'll explain later.
You see that door?
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.
We got it!
We got it!
Yeah.
Hey, let's drink to it.
Yeah, yeah.
First bar we find?
First bar we find.
Okay.
Oh, that was a bull's-eye.
Give us whatever you've got.
Quick.
Quick.
No, not this one.
Come on, have a drink.
We'll open up a good bottle of Bordeaux.
I've never tasted wine till we got to Normandy.
Well, do you like it?
Yeah, I like it.
Hey, I hear there's a war going on.
Oh, come on, give me a break, will ya?
You know, this is exactly the way
I thought Paris would be... a little place like this, checkered tablecloths... red wine.
Come on, Grandpa, you've done your share.
Pardon.
Yes, come back tomorrow.
Hey! Psst! Psst!
Get back inside, for God's sake!
You'll get yourselves killed!
Get back!
They're coming nearer!
Get ready to fire!
300 meters!
Don't stay together!
Francoise! Francoise!
Get over here!
Hurry!
Go get that machine gun!
What are you waiting for!
What's wrong?
It's jammed.
One of the tanks got the panzer.
All right! Let's go!
Good luck to you, Corporal.
I'll be glad to get back to my wife.
She's been waiting six years.
We all have families.
A panzer!
Near the obelisk!
Fire!
Got it! With the smoke shell!
He's going to shoot at us!
No time to reload!
Ram him! Ram him!
A panzer.
Our first in Paris.
Ah, those cowards.
They ran away.
All right, all right. Let's go.
Let's go.
Come on!
Let's go. Back up.
That's right.
We made it at last.
There it is.
Now all we have to do is get inside.
That's not going to be so easy,
Lieutenant.
Well, someone's got to do it.
All right, men, let's go.
Joliot, you and your men guard the entrance.
The others, Gully, Herman, come with me. Inside.
Do we shoot?
Why else are we here?
For a picnic?!
Back, everyone!
A grenade. Quick!
In the interest of saving lives and after a token resistance to preserve our honor,
I'll surrender the city.
I remain, Herr Consul Nordling, gratefully yours...
And so on and so forth.
And see that all this is packed.
We're about to be prisoners of war.
That's if we're lucky.
That'll give me a chance to read
War and Peace at last.
Colonel, I would like to thank you, too.
Get out, all of you, one by one, with your hands up.
All of you, take care of them.
Where's the General?
Herman.
So, Colonel, where's the General?
Who? The General?
- Yes.
- He's upstairs.
Will he surrender?
He will surrender, but only to an officer of the regular army.
Show us the way.
They are here.
Lieutenant Henri Karcher, army of General de Gaulle.
Lieutenant General von Choltitz,
Commander of Paris.
Are you willing to surrender?
Ja.
Unconditionally?
Ja.
Then you are my prisoner.
Give us your arms.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Major Larorie.
General von Choltitz, you have engaged in battle, you have lost.
In the name of General Bayet,
I ask you to give me some of your officers who will ride in Jeeps carrying the white flag so we can convey the order of surrender to those still fighting.
There are already too many killed and wounded.
General, will you follow me?
Karcher, you're in charge of the others.
Yes, sir.
The moment has come.
Come on.
Where are you taking me?
You've surrendered to the French army.
Now you're going to sign the act of capitulation.
Hello, Papa?
This is Lieutenant Karcher.
Your son.
In spite of your pessimistic view of my military career,
I'd like to announce that I've just made prisoners of the general in command of Paris at the Hotel Meurice.
He surrendered to me.
But I'm still very bad at drill.
Go on! Go on!
Go on! Oh...
We made it.
We won the race.
Where are we?
In front of Notre Dame.
What's it look like?
Just like they said, big.
And beautiful with... two towers.

Yokohama Guards:
Tsurumi Soji Temple
The word "surrender" is not in the dictionary of the Imperial Army!
We must fight, down to the last man!
Therefore, you bastards...
Therefore, you bastards...
But sir...
...there's been no orders, no command to mobilize from Shibuya headquarters.
Don't get wishy-washy on me!
You guys heard the news. There's going to be an important broadcast at noon tomorrow!
We don't have a moment to lose!
Immediately, let us unite in action!
The countersigning by all the ministers is complete.
Then, Mr. Sato, we can begin.
We're going to transmit the telegrams now. To all the Allied nations.
All right?
Bye now.
Do we...
Do we...
Send them.
Send them.
Understood.
Send them.
It's all over now...
It's been a long day...
Can't think of a longer one.
The Cabinet ministers, having met constantly since the 9th...
...were as one overcome by a deep physical and mental fatigue.
Most of them fell into a state of near despondency.
All kinds of tangled thoughts came and went in their torpor.
Some struggled to comprehend the meaning of the nation's first defeat in its long history...
Some could not stop thinking of the con- sequences of not ending the war...
Atomic bombs destroying city after city, one after another...
One million Allied troops flooding onto
Kyushu's Satsuma Peninsula...
...and Kanto's Kujukuri-hama Bay.
The Soviet Union in Hokkaido... no, the Soviet Union marching south...
...into the Korean Peninsulas, into northern
Kyushu, even as far as Chugoku.
Japan getting divided into parts... men, women, even children and the elderly...
...all falling and dying amidst horrid plumes of gunpowder smoke...
...the isles of Japan becoming isles of death, mountains built of 80-million corpses...
But physical exhaustion overwhelmed these vague thoughts.
As these thoughts faded, they were replaced by one last one:
"I'm tired. It was a long day.
It was a truly long day...
"...but this long day is finally over."
In this thought they were united, and they were all wrong.
The long day was far from over; only half of it had elapsed.
The Commander of the
Guard is with a guest?
What guest?
Lt. Colonel Shiraishi, from from the 2nd General Army Staff Office.
Colonel Shiraishi... isn't Colonel Shiraishi the Guard Commander's...
...brother-in-law. Yes.
...brother-in-law. Yes.
We don't have time for this!
Ida! While you're here, I'll go to the
Shibui Barracks in Surugadai.
The barracks in
Surugadai?
Yes! I'm going to appeal to Lt. Colonel Takeshita of the Military Affairs Section.
...and ask him to have the Minister of War take decisive action!
I am much obliged to you for many things.
No...
I'm just very glad that things resolved uneventfully.
Excuse me.
All during these meetings about ending the war...
...I have spoken as a representative of the Armed Forces...
...and have been quite obstinate in expressing my opinions.
I now want to humbly express my apologies.
My honest intent was a simple one, namely, to protect the nation. I had no other agenda.
Please understand, and forgive me.
I understand very well.
I want to thank you with all my heart for your frank opinions.
Whatever was said, it came from your passionate concern for the nation.
But, General
Anami...
The nation of Japan is at peace.
I do not feel much anxiety about its future.
I, too, believe the same.
This was sent to me from the Southern front.
I do not smoke, so I brought them, hoping that they might give you pleasure.
Anami, my friend, you have an eloquent way of saying farewell.
How loud should my voice be?
Your normal tone of voice would be fine.
We, after greatly considering the general state of the
World, and the specific conditions of our Empire...
...have decided that the settlement of the situation requires an extraordinary measure...
...which we now announce to our good and loyal subjects.
Holding our senior cadets
in high esteem...
Every time we hear of their distinguished
deeds, it gives us a thrill.
Firmly work up, work up
the spirit of attack.
No enemy is a match
for the Yamato spirit.
However, the conflict has now lasted for nearly four years.
The officers of the Army and Navy have lead a valiant war effort.
They have been diligently supported by our Servants in the Government.
They have been devotedly served by Our hundred million Subjects.
Despite the fact that each has done his very, very best...
...the war situation has developed in a manner not to the Nation's advantage.
I wish I could send my
mother a picture...
... of the splendidly sinking
enemy-ship.
And furthermore, should we continue to fight...
...not only would our Nation be destroyed and our Subjects obliterated...
...but eventually, all of human civilization would vanish from the Earth.
This being the case, how can we preserve the multitudes of our people...
The final Attack Squadron,
#12, is departing, sir!
Your Excellency.
The second infantry regiment of the Imperial Guard...
...is already in the palace compound, with military banners raised.
They are going to revolt at 2:00 and besiege the palace.
We are against the government defeatists who hope that we can arrange...
...for the Emperor to be retained as a mere figurehead.
Our Emperor a puppet?! Our people totally demoralized?!
Our homeland devastated?! Does this sit well with you?
To put it bluntly, they're letting His Majesty clean up the mess of the war they lost...
...while they themselves are trying to shirk responsibility.
That's what the current
Ministers are doing.
You can argue all you want, but now that the Emperor has made his decision...
...I cannot agree with any action that opposes the will of His Majesty.
But, Your Excellency!

It would be unfortunate if the lid came off... do you have an appropriate container?
I think something can be found...
We'd really appreciate it if you could find an appropriate container.
How about something like this?
Yes, that would do just fine. Thank you.
The broadcast will be at noon... Where should this be placed to keep it safe?

The Commander? He's raised a military flag inside of the palace grounds?
The Commander? He's raised a military flag inside of the palace grounds?
So Colonel Haga has agreed?
Yes. They're going to rise up at 2:00 a.m.
And besiege the palace.
In addition, four other commanders have also given proactive consent to our plan!
What about Guard
Commander Mori?
No, the Guard Commander alone has not agreed.
Ida and Shiizaki are even now trying to convince him...
...and that's just a matter of time.
Col. Takeshita, we want to ask of you to persuade Minister of War Anami.
No one else can do that but you.
But even if I explained everything to him, at this stage the Minister probably won't...
No, it will work!
As long as you're the one who goes to him, Col. Takeshita. Please!
There's no time, I have to get back to the Imperial Guards.
We've come this far, we'll do it by brute force alone if we have to.
Col. Takeshita.
We're not asking for you to agree right this minute.
But if everything goes according to plan, then please, join us!
Hatanaka. I'll go and see the
Minister immediately.
Yes?
I don't know if I'll ask him to take action.
But I'm a little concerned about him.
The broadcasting station is going to take it?
Yes, since the broadcast will be made from the station...
...I think that it is the obvious choice.
But...
...there is much cause for concern...
...in taking this record with us in the middle of the night. Besides...
...we heard that there is unrest among elements of the Army.
If that's the case, it might be best to keep it here, in the Imperial Household.
But there is no appropriate place here in which to keep it safe.
Maybe the Chamberlain and his men should care for it, as they attend upon His Majesty.
Chamberlain Tokugawa

I see. In that case, I see no problem with taking custody of it.
I see. In that case, I see no problem with taking custody of it.
Your Excellency...
I have said everything that I wanted to say.
No...
...one last thing.
If there is to be no decisive battle on home soil... if the war ends so ignominiously...
...wouldn't that be a craven betrayal of the heroic spirits...
...of the three-million and more who have given their lives at the front lines?
Even now as we speak, kamikaze pilots are headed out...
...launching an attack against an enemy fleet.
Instead of fighting to the last soldier...
...if we lay down our arms by command of the Emperor...
It sounds dutiful, but it's just a shirking of responsibility!
What will the people think of the military then?
Will they not consider us to be self- serving, double-dealing cowards?
Your Excellency.
I will say no more.
Now is the time for all military men to stake their lives...
...and the Imperial Guard ought to be in the vanguard.
Please...
...if I may have Your Excellency's resolution.
I now have a sufficient understanding of what you're all aiming at.
Frankly speaking,
I'm impressed.
I will now go to the
Meiji Jingu Shrine.
Yes?
As just a simple
Japanese man...
...I'm going to bow down in front of the Meiji Jingu shrine...
...and decide on the path I am to take.
While I'm at it, I will also hear what
Chief of Staff Mizutani has to say.
Yes sir! Goodbye!
We have with us Captain Kuroda of the pilot school.
How did it go?
I think he will take action. He's going to talk to Chief of Staff Mizutani.
Then he will...
I'll give you the details later. Shiizaki's here, too, go wait in there with them.
Very good, Sir!
Army Lt. Colonel Hatanaka entering!
Mr. Shiizaki...
What is happening?
His Excellency will be going to Meiji Jingu.
You're not going to Meiji Jingu, you're going to the palace!
What?
Who the hell are you?
Captain Kuroda of the pilot school.
I have come upon hearing the news of the Imperial Guard's uprising.
What uprising?
Your Excellency! With respect to rising up, what is your intent?
I have none!
Lt. Colonel Hatanaka, this is our last chance.
We can't just linger, we're running out of time.
Your Excellency! We implore you!
Reconsider! Please reconsider!
Importunate puppy!
Your Excellency!
Insolence!
Your Excellency!
You bastards...
Hatanaka! What have you done?!
I couldn't convince the Commander... no... there was no time...
...I had no time... so
I had to do it...
Ida! Together, quickly...
Imperial Guard Chief of Staff Mizutani
Ida! Together, quickly...
Ida! Together, quickly...
As fast, fast as possible, at once, we must go to the Eastern District Army...

Mori has been... killed!
What?!

As we have said, the aim of the uprising of the Imperial Guard...

It's very hot in here; may we take off our jackets?
No, and that's an order!
I'm going to the palace right away to suppress this rebellion!
Sir, please wait until we find out more... until we know what we're up against.
We don't know what the situation is.
All we know is that a group of armed
Imperial Guards have revolted.
We must first investigate the situation.
Can you contact the palace?
Sir, we're doing everything we can...
...but it seems they've cut the phone lines.
So the recording was done late tonight inside the palace?
Yes.
Where is the recording?
We have given it to the Imperial
Household Agency.
The Imperial Household
Agency?
To whom at the Imperial
Household Agency?
I don't know his name.
He is a Chamberlain.
A Chamberlain, you say?
We're done. Take them away.
Yes, sir!
The record is within our reach.
All that's left now is...
The uprising of the Eastern District Army, and having the Minister of War take action.
Has the Minister of
War arrived yet?
Lt. Colonel Takeshita has gone to fetch him.
He will be here shortly.
This is Captain Kuroda of the pilot school.
I have come to deliver a message to Lt. Colonel Takeshita.
What?!
They've killed Commander
Mori?
Hatanaka.
It's no good.
The Eastern District Army is frozen in place.
There's no indication they'll rise.
Give up and withdraw the troops.
If we continue the siege, it'll become a national calamity.
Then we'll have to battle the
Eastern District Army.
I have no fear of battle! We have control of both the palace and the Emperor!
We also have many prisoners, such as broadcast president Shimomura!
Don't be stupid!
How long will the Imperial Guards stand with us, now that you've killed their commander?!
Without their solidarity, how can we stand in battle?
When they find out about the Commander's death, their morale will plummet!
Don't you understand?
Withdraw the troops before dawn.
As for what happened tonight...
...we'll take the blame for it ourselves.
Hatanaka.
Just let it be.
What happened here tonight...
...the people of the world will probably laugh at us bitterly, and think of it as...
...a fleeting, final struggle by the Japanese Army.
A midsummer night's dream.
Now, I'm going to go and report the situation to the Minister of War.
Okay, Hatanaka?
You must withdraw the troops before dawn.
A bump in the road; looks like this might take longer than we thought.
The Eastern District Army is going to fight us? Don't make me laugh.
We have the Emperor; do you think they'll attack us with tanks and planes?

...because they didn't have the
Emperor in their custody.
But...
...our situation is the exact opposite. Those who attack us will be the rebels.
Besides, our orders remain in force.
If we can hold out long enough...
...the entire Army will eventually hear about it, and they will certainly side with us.
The final victory will be ours, no matter what happens.
And if anyone gets in our way...
That's right... That record... If that ever got broadcast, all would be lost.
We must find that record as soon as possible; every second, every minute counts!

Then...
...could you identify him if you saw his face?
Yes. I think so.

Slay them without mercy! Find that record immediately!
Yes, sir.
We've searched high and low, and it's nowhere to be found...
Maybe... the record is being kept close to His Majesty?
I know what you're all up to!
Now... Now I know what you're up to!
You're rebelling!
That's why Minister Anami and the Commander of the Eastern District Army haven't arrived.
And maybe, it was you who murdered our Commander!
You have been deceiving me!
I will take no further orders from any of you. Get the hell out of the palace!
If you intend to continue, then you'll have to kill me!
You'll do this over my dead body!
We require that you follow our orders.
What?
You must obey the orders of your Commander.
Unfortunately, your Commander is dead...
...but his orders live on.
But... you probably made up those orders!
The military acts on orders alone.
Orders from superior officers cannot be questioned!

Kill me if you must. But killing me won't solve anything.
Killing gutless worms like you will only rust my sword.
Instead, I'll show you the true meaning of Japanese spirit!

We've thoroughly searched and come up empty...
Maybe the record is at the broadcast bureau...
But then again...
But then again...
Shiizaki...
The Minister of War will not stir. The Eastern
District Army will not mobilize.
And on top of all that, we can't find the record.
There's nothing more we can do... nothing more!
Don't panic! We can still do this.
Huh?
Go now to the occupied broadcast bureau.
And just at the break of dawn, broadcast to all of Japan:
"We must not accept the Declaration. Japan shall fight a war of total resistance.
"If you hear a broadcast of the Emperor accepting the Potsdam Declaration...
"...know it to be a trick of cowardly senior statesmen.
"The genuine will of His Majesty is that his glorious Army and Navy...
"...should defend the nation to the last man!"
Your Excellency! Let me go with you!
You fool! What are you saying?!
The only one who will die tonight is me.
Don't you know that it takes more courage to live than to die?
When you're as old as I am, it isn't that hard to cut your belly.
What is difficult is that task that awaits all of you young people.
But what good can we do by living?
Minister... Minister, do you believe that the nation can be rebuilt?
It must be rebuilt.
All kinds of hardship await those who will live on.
However...
However, from this day onward...
...Japan's path through history is going to change.
As to how it will change, how it must be changed...
...I no longer have any idea, whatsoever.
But no matter what the future has in store...
...each and every Japanese must stand by their station...
...live on, endure, and work earnestly.
In no other way can the nation be rebuilt.
And not only that...
Those who live on must build a Japan...
...that will never have to face such a miserable day again.
I want you to make every effort to create that kind of Japan.
Day will be breaking soon.
It's August 15th, 1945.

What a mess. They're supposed to guard His Majesty...

What does the

He said, "I'm going out there. Assemble the troops in the garden.
"I'm going to speak to the troops from my heart.
"Also, please ask the Military Liaison

Where did they go?!
I... I wasn't told.
Burn it! The house of a national traitor is defiled! Burn it to the ground!
Yes, sir!
Fire!
But I'm begging you!
No, we won't authorize a broadcast.
I won't say anything about not accepting the Declaration!
Please, please, let me speak for the young officers who took a stand this night!
Just let me speak for five minutes, no, just three minutes only!
Hatanaka, that's enough.
You're obsessed.
"Obsessed?"
Right, we're done here!

To protect the nation, we soldiers who have risen up today, on August 15th...
...are making an announcement to all the soldiers and people of the nation.
We will protect the Emperor from the plots of the enemy...
...and keep the nation safe.
We don't care if we win or lose; we don't do this for ourselves!
We only wish to live in the righteous state of genuine loyalty!

Ah...
I'm so glad... so glad that you're safe.
Mr. Sakomizu, does today's Privy Council meeting at the palace start at 11:00?
Yes.
After that meeting, I want to hold a Cabinet meeting...
...and call for the mass resignation of all Cabinet members.
It's time for us elders to step down.
From now on, Japan must be lead by much younger people.
All officers of the military and people of all stations!
We ask you to take to heart the original intent of our uprising...
...which was to expose the treachery of the ministers, to destroy conspiracies...
...and to protect the nation, defending it to the last man!
To protect the nation, we soldiers who have risen up today, on August 15th...
...are making an announcement to all the soldiers and people of the nation.
Hello, Mr. Togo? At 11:00 today there will be a Privy Council meeting at the palace.
Inasmuch as the end of the war has been officially decided...
Yes, I heard about it yesterday.
Yes, but afterward, the Cabinet will meet in order that they might resign.
That's correct, a mass resignation.
Thank you.
The broadcast bureau? Yes, we can deploy troops right away.
Huh? What?! The record got there?!
Both the original and copy, you're sure?
I'm going to the Parliamentary
Affairs Room.
Mr. Shimomura, I know you'll be able to coordinate the resignations.
I must go to the Palace to prepare for the Privy Council meeting at 11:00.
The Secretary General is very busy.
These last 24 hours, even two or three of him would not have been enough.
But why would they have a Privy Council meeting to decide to end the war again?
After all, the fact of the matter is that the decision has already been made.
No, not necessarily.
Yes?
It requires all kinds of formalities. It may be more accurate to call them "ceremonies."
After all, it's the funeral of the Japanese empire.
We don't care if we win or lose; we don't do this for ourselves!
We only wish to live in the righteous state of genuine loyalty!
All officers of the military and people of all stations!

Everyone is assembled to listen to the Emperor's broadcast.
Since our kamikaze attack was unsuccessful...
...and the city of Kumagaya has been destroyed by B-29 firebombing...
...there are many who think that that's what the broadcast will be about.
That the Emperor is going to admonish and encourage us...
...to keep on fighting.

His Excellency, the Commander of the Eastern District Army...
...will be entering to witness the broadcast.
His Majesty's broadcast will finally be made...

No! Let me go!

There will now be an important broadcast.
We ask for everyone listening to please stand.
His Majesty, the Emperor, will now address the nation...
...and pronounce his great Rescript.
And now, with deep respect, we convey to you the Emperor's voice.
We, reflecting profoundly on
the state of the world...
... and the prevailing condition
of Our Empire...
... have decided that extraordinary measures
are required to effect a settlement...
... and hereby announce
to our loyal citizens...
... that we have ordered our Government
to communicate to the Governments...
... of the United States, Great Britain,
China, and the Soviet Union...
... that our Empire accepts the provisions
of their joint Declaration.
It was a long, long

War ended.

Warren?
You'll wake yourself up.
I'll get you breakfast.
No time. The meeting starts at 10:00.
Don't worry about it.
They always have coffee there.
You're gonna fly down?
I'll check out one of the trainers.
That way I can get back when I want.
What are you up to today
Shopping. I'll get clothes for the boys.
They grow so fast.
Need any money? I cashed a cheque.
I had the dream again.
Always ends at the same place.
I guess that's just as well.
Sometime I'm going to see that matador, find out who he is.
When I do, that's it, that's the end of me.
Don't talk like that now, it's only a dream.
- Maybe I ought to resign.
- What good would that do?
It would make the dream go away.
I'm sure of that. They're connected.
Katie, the dream and what I'm doing.
Sometimes I feel the only way I can make it disappear is to give it all up, to resign.
But you can't resign.
You can't give up your whole life.
You're my life, too.
You and the boys.
Maybe I have to choose.
Or maybe it's too late.
Oh, Warren, don't go. Skip the meeting.
Tell them my wife insists
I go shopping with her?
I'll skip the shopping.
We could have lunch together.
We haven't done that in months.
A little French restaurant with wine.
This one's special.
The new Secretary's going to be there.
They're even holding it in the war room to show how up-to-date we are.
You could do with a day off.
In the middle of the week? That's immoral.
We can go out for dinner.
I'll be back by then.
If I can get a sitter.
You got me, you can get anything.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
You wouldn't do very well.
There's no chance of that, is there?
None at all.
Two hours ago you said 100 million dead.
Now you say 60 million.
I say 60 million is perhaps the highest price we should be prepared to pay in a war.
And what's the difference between
60 million dead and 100 million?
- 40 million.
- Some difference.
Are you prepared to say the saving of 40 million lives is of no importance?
You miss the point, Professor.
The saving of those 60 million lives is what's important.
Face facts, Mr Foster.
We're talking about war.
I say every war, including thermonuclear war, must have a winner and a loser.
Which would you rather be?
In a nuclear war, everyone loses.
War isn't what it used to be.
It's still the resolution of economic and political conflict.
Well, what kind of resolution with 100 million dead?
- It doesn't have to be 100 million.
- Even 60!
The same as 1,000 years ago, sir, when you also had wars that wiped out whole peoples.
The point is still who wins and who loses, the survival of a culture.
A culture? With most of its people dead, the rest dying, the food poisoned, the air unfit to breathe?
- You call that a culture?
- Yes, I do, Mr Foster.
I am not a poet. I'm a political scientist who would rather have an American culture survive than a Russian one.
But what would it be like?
I mean, really like? Who would survive?
Who would survive?
It's an interesting question.
I would predict convicts and file clerks.
And the worst convicts, those deep down in solitary confinement, and the most ordinary file clerks, probably for large insurance companies.
Because they would be in fireproofed rooms, protected by tons of the best insulator in the world, paper.
Then imagine what will happen.
The small group of vicious criminals will fight the army of file clerks for the remaining means of life.
The convicts will know violence but the file clerks will know organization.
Who do you think will win?
It's all hypothesis, of course, but fun to play around with.
And, time to go home.
I didn't mean to hold forth so long.
I don't usually come to a supper party and talk right through to breakfast.
Nonsense, Professor. We were fascinated.
I just hope we didn't keep you from your work.
Not at all.
I've got a 10:00 meeting at the Pentagon.
Plenty of time to get home and change.
You must come again,
Professor Groeteschele, with your wife this time.
I'd be delighted.
- Good night.
- All right. Thanks.
Thanks again, ma'am.
I'm Ilsa Wolfe.
We were introduced before dinner.
I'd like you to take me home.
You'll have to give me directions.
Just stay on this road.
You could joke about the convicts and file clerks because you know there won't be any survivors, will there?
Not many.
None. None at all.
That's the beauty of it.
I've heard nuclear war called a lot of things,
Miss Wolfe, never beautiful.
People are afraid to call it that, but that's what they feel.
- The beauty of death?
- Don't patronize me.
What else but that are you selling,
Professor?
We all know we're going to die, but you make a game out of it, a marvelous game that includes the whole world.
- You make it seem possible.
- It is possible, even probable.
You make death an entertainment, something that can be played in a living room.
As good a place as any.
No. No, there's an even better place.
Turn in there.
This where you live?
- Don't joke.
- Why not? I'm the joker.
I make death into a game for people like you to get excited about.
I watched you tonight.
You'd love making it possible, wouldn't you?
You'd love pressing that button.
What a thrill that would be.
Knowing you have to die, to have the power to take everyone else with you, the mob of them with their plans, their little hopes, born to be murdered and turning away from it, closing their eyes to it.
And you could be the one to make it true, do it to them.
But you're afraid, so you look for the thrill someplace else.
And who better than a man who isn't afraid?
I'm not your kind.
- Airman?
- Sir?
General Bogan should be on his way in.
Tell him I checked out the new computer.
I'll be back on duty before he leaves to check it out again with him.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll be in my quarters if he wants me.
- Yes, sir. Oh, sir?
- Yes?
There's a telephone message for you.
They want you to call right back, said it was urgent.
Line, please.
Hello.
Yes, I got the message.
Why do you think I'm calling?
Well, where did he get the money?
No, no, no, I'll come myself.
I'm going into town, Airman.
That's the address.
I'll be there about a half an hour, then I'm coming back to the base.
Yes, sir.
Better button up before the general gets here.
Yes, sir.
General Bogars office. Airman Slote.
No, sir, General. He's just left.
Damn it, I need him.
Where did he sign out to?
Conklin, you know where that is?
Yes, sir. It's on the way to the base.
Well, get on over there.
I'll pick him up myself, Airman. Thank you.
- This is the house, General.
- You sure this is it?
You sure there's not another street by this name?
Oh, no, sir. I've lived in Omaha all my life.
I know this city like the back of my hand.
No, don't bother getting out.
- Spending the money I send you on this!
- Give me that!
You raise your hand against my mother once more...
Just a drop! Who the hell are you?
- Yeah?
- I'm General Bogan.
I'm looking for Colonel Cascio.
He gave this address.
- Oh, sure, now, General.
- Let the gentleman in, Luke.
Honoured to have you.
My son always speaks well of you.
Sorry to bother you, Colonel.
We have some unexpected VIPs we have to show around.
Yes, sir. I'll be right along.
Why don't you come in, General?
Thank you, I...
I just take a drop now and then.
The boy here, he gets a little excited.
I'm ready, sir.
Damn snot-nosed kid.
It's that Congressman Raskob, the one who's been nosing around the bases.
Washington wants us to put his mind at ease.
- He's on one of those committees.
- Yes, sir.
Gordon Knapp will also be there to look over that equipment his company makes.
He'll be on our side.
Anyone looks cross-eyed at his stuff, he goes up like a rocket.
Yes, sir.
Time was when I'd say
"he goes up like a balloon."
- Times change.
- Yes, sir.
Ploesti, that was the rough one.
We lost half our group.
Regensburg was the worst one for us.
I never flew the B-17, only 24s.
Good aeroplane, the 24.
At least you knew you were flying the aeroplane, not the other way around, like today's things.
You still have to fly the Vindicator, Grady.
We're the last of the lot, Flynn.
Don't kid yourself about that.
- The next aeroplanes, they won't need men.
- You'll be too old, anyway.
After us, the machines.
We're halfway there already.
Look at those kids.
Remember the crews you had on the 24s?
Jews, Italians, all kinds.
You could tell them apart. They were people.
These kids, you open them up, you'll find they run on transistors.
- No, they're good kids, I tell you.
- Sure, sure.
You know they're good at their jobs, but you don't know them. How can you?
We get a different crew every time we go up.
That's policy, Grady.
It eliminates the personal factor.
Everything is more complicated now.
Reaction time is faster.
You can't depend on people the same way.
Who do you depend on?
All right, gentlemen. The sky awaits.
You know something, Billy?
I like the personal factor.
Those are Vindicator bombers of the Strategic Air Command on routine patrol
Each one of those planes carries four Bloodhound air-to-air missiles armed with nuclear warheads.
Those are for use against attacking enemy fighter planes.
In addition, of course, each plane carries two 20-megaton hydrogen bombs designed to detonate over enemy targets.
At any given moment, night or day, flights of those aeroplanes are in the air, in case of any surprise attack on our bases.
You can see some of the other groups...
- Who controls them?
- We do.
This is the nerve center, Mr Raskob.
This room.
All these machines you see are constantly receiving information
- from all over the world.
- And above it.
Mr Knapp's company did the electronic work on the Argo satellite.
Would you like to see what it's photographing right now? Colonel.
This picture you're about to see,
Mr Raskob, is being taken now, by a camera 300 miles in the sky traveling at 20,000 miles an hour.
Can you give us tighter scale on this,
General?
Colonel?
Those are the rocket sites from 300 miles up.
- I'm impressed.
- We'll get it sharper than that before long.
Be able to see the people, not just the machines.
We'll show you the hair on their head,
Mr Raskob.
- I suppose they're doing the same to us.
- Well, you can see for yourself.
Colonel, let's take a look at the Russian submarines in the Pacific.
There's the western coast of the United States, Hawaiian Islands and those are Russian subs.
That close?
Nearest is about 50 miles off San Francisco,
I'd say.
International waters.
Nothing we can do except keep an eye on it.
Well, that's too damn close.
What's it doing there?
- Scanning us, the way we do them.
- Is it armed?
We have instruments so good, Mr Raskob, they can tell the difference between a whale breaking wind and that sub blowing its tanks.
No argument, General. I'm sure we've got the best that money can buy.
- We're very proud of what we do here, sir.
- You ought to be, Colonel.
- The money is well spent, Mr Raskob.
- I don't doubt it for a minute.
And you don't have to snow me, General.
My committee doesn't deal with appropriations, only with how the appropriations are spent.
Well, you see it all around you.
Pretty impressive, isn't it?
Well, I'll tell you the truth, these machines scare the hell out of me.
I don't like the idea that every time I take off my hat, some thing up there knows
I'm losing my hair.
I wanna be damn sure that thing doesn't get any ideas of its own.
I see what you mean, Mr Raskob, but that's a chance you take with these systems.
But who says we have to take that chance?
Who voted who the power to do it this particular way?
I'm the only one around here got elected by anybody.
Nobody gave me that power.
It's in the nature of technology.
Machines are developed to meet situations.
Then they take over, they start creating situations.
Not necessarily.
There's always the chance.
You said so yourself.
Well, we have checks on everything,
Mr Raskob. Checks and counter-checks.
Yeah, but who checks the checker?
Where's the end of the line, Joe?
Who's got the responsibility?
- The President.
- No one.
He can't know everything that's going on.
How can he? It's too complicated.
If you want to know, that's what really bothers me.
The only thing everyone can agree on is that no one's responsible.
Is something wrong, General?
UFO sighted near Hudson Bay, sir.
What you're seeing, gentlemen, is an unidentified flying object picked up by our radar.
Until we get positive identification, we regard it as hostile.
What do you do about it?
Well, we've gone to Condition Blue, which is our lowest form of readiness.
At the same time, we've informed those Vindicator bombers that you saw in the air before.
They will now start to fly towards their fail-safe points.
"Fail-safe"?
Fixed points in the sky on the perimeter of the Soviet Union which are changed from day to day.
The planes will fly to those points and orbit until they get a positive order to go in.
- And if they don't get that order?
- They return to their normal patrols.
In short, Mr Raskob, we can't go to war except on an express order.
How do they get that order, by radio?
Yes, and through a box we call the fail-safe box aboard each plane which can only be activated at the express order of the President.
- Oh, he has to tell them?
- Not directly. No.
His voice can be imitated, you know.
He just gives the order and the rest is done electronically.
No one can interfere with the fail-safe box,
Mr Raskob. No one.
All those new blips you see are fighter planes going after the unidentified object.
Colonel Cascio, tight scale, please.
You seem pretty cool about this, General.
Does it happen often?
Oh, about six times a month.
Probably an airliner off course.
- And if it isn't?
- Well, then it's something else.
That means it's at 30,000 feet, going 525 miles an hour on a compass heading of 196.
Headed right for Detroit.
Seven minutes to fail-safe.
Oh, normal procedure, Mr Raskob.
We start an automatic countdown at this point.
It's very unlikely the bombers will even reach their fail-safe points.
I'd say it happens about one time in 20.
We usually identify the disturbance well before that.
Six minutes to fail-safe.
What have you got there, Blackie?
Another UFO?
For a dollar, a commercial plane or a flock of birds?
Plane. Off course.
You ought to give me odds.
Yes, be sure you give me that...
I read your memo on counterforce credibility.
I don't think Groeteschele's going to discuss that today.
You mean you think I should lay off?
Why open a can of peas?
Well, we've got to discuss it one of these days, Stark.
This whole policy of overkill, it makes no sense piling up bombs when we already have a capacity...
Okay, Blackie, just not today.
- Good morning, Mr Secretary.
- Morning, Mr Secretary.
- Wort you sit over there?
- Thank you.
- Morning, Mr Secretary.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Everyone here, General Stark?
- Yes, sir.
All right, Professor Groeteschele.
I see we have an alert to supplement our discussion.
Unfortunately, we settled the question of accidental war last week so we can't make use of it today.
Today, the subject is limited war.
It is not theoretical.
On it depends the kind of weapons we use, where we locate them, how we use them.
In short, our entire military posture.
So, is limited war possible?
Can we confine the exchange of nuclear weapons to military targets alone, or must war lead inevitably to the destruction of cities?
- It must.
- Why?
The object of war is to inflict maximum damage on the enemy, destroy his ability to resist.
In the last war, both sides could have used bacterial warfare.
They didn't.
It wouldn't have been decisive.
Can you be sure?
Well, maybe people still couldn't get used to the idea of killing civilians.
I suggest you take that up with the civilians of London, Hamburg, Dresden or Tokyo, killed by the thousands in bombing raids.
I omit Hiroshima and Nagasaki, since those actions belong more properly to World War III than World War II.
I still don't see how we could restrict a war.
We could come to a mutual agreement with the Russians to strike only at missile bases.
What if the missile bases were near the cities?
They would have an incentive to move them elsewhere.
They might take such an offer as a sign of weakness on our part.
- It could be worth a try.
- They've got as much to lose as we have.
We're talking about the wrong subject.
We've got to stop war, not limit it.
That is not up to us, General Black.
We're the ones who know most about it.
You're a soldier, Blackie.
You carry out policy. You don't make it.
Don't kid yourself, Stark.
The way we say a war can be fought is making policy.
If we say we can fight a limited war with nuclear weapons, all we do is let everyone off the hook.
It's what they want to hear.
We can just keep on doing what we're doing, and nobody really gets hurt.
But you can't fight a limited war, and you know it.
For my part, I'm not so sure.
There's no such thing as a limited war anymore.
Not with hydrogen bombs, there isn't.
Once those bombs start to drop, you won't be able to limit a damn thing.
Are you advocating disarmament,
General Black?
I don't know.
Well, it's the logic of your position.
Peculiar reversal.
The press would be interested.
The military man who is the dove, and the civilian who is the hawk.
We're going too fast.
Things are getting out of hand.
Can you be more specific, General?
We're all trying to make war more efficient.
- That's our job.
- And we're succeeding.
We now have the capacity to blow up the whole world several times over.
Which does not mean we must do it.
We won't be able to stop from doing it.
That's the logic of your position,
Groeteschele.
We're setting up a war machine that acts faster than the ability of men to control it.
We're putting men into situations that are getting too tough for men to handle.
Then we must toughen the men.
Suppose they launch a first strike against us?
Then we retaliate, and we're all finished.
Oh, would you prefer that only we were finished?
We have to prepare.
We're preparing.
We've got to slow down.
I disagree. We have got to speed up.
Naturally, that means taking risks, but our intention is always to minimize those risks.
Of course, we can only control our own actions.
Our concept of limited war is based on an equal rationality on the part of the Russians.
It also presupposes there will be no accidents on either side.
But suppose, for an example, that unidentified flying object was one of their 50-megaton missiles that had gotten loose by mistake.
What could be done? How could they prove it was really an accident?
Would it make any difference if they could?
Even if we believe them, should we still think in terms of limiting our response or should we hit them back with everything we have?
It's gone, General. What happened to it?
- Colonel Cascio...
- Sir.
...let's go to Condition Yellow.
- Yes, sir.
It's dropped below the level at which our radar can pick it up, that's all.
You went to the next state of readiness.
Well, that's SOP, Mr Knapp.
It could be a commercial plane about to crash.
Or an enemy plane taking evasive action.
Naturally, we prepare for the worst.
Two minutes to fail-safe.
What are those planes following the bombers, General?
Fighter support. Part of Condition Yellow.
From now on, they'll take a refuelling and they'll follow the bombers as far as they go.
- What comes after Condition Yellow?
- Green.
- And then?
- Red. But we've never gone to red yet.
Red means war, doesn't it?
- Not an air breather?
- What does that mean?
Well, jet planes suck air through their engines.
Our warning system can pick up the turbulence this creates.
It could be a commercial plane that's lost power, no turbulence would be created.
- It could be a rocket.
- Off course?
Maybe on.
One minute to fail-safe.
It could be a Russian rocket, sir, coming in low where our radar can't pick it up.
- Could it be that?
- It could be anything.
- Well, how do you find out?
- Our fighters are tracking it.
Countdown will now be in seconds.
- Can't wait too long.
All groups at fail-safe point
Right on the dot. That's flying.
- Colonel Cascio?
- Yes, sir?
- Go to Condition Green.
- Yes, sir.
Tell the planes to keep orbiting until we get positive identification of the UFO.
They'll do that anyway, sir.
That's their orders.
- Well, tell them again.
- Yes, sir.
- I'll have to ask you gentleman to leave now.
- Sorry.
- That is an order, Mr Raskob.
- You've got the wrong customer, General.
The way I see it, we could be at war in just about two minutes.
You can't get me back to my family in that time,
- so I'm staying here to see what happens.
- There's no place for you here.
If those bombs go off, General, there's no place for me anywhere.
You want me out of here, you better call those MP's.
- I think it's coming up again.
- We can't wait any longer, sir.
Give me a tight scale.
That's it, gentlemen. Sorry we alarmed you.
Contact all the planes and have them resume their normal patrols.
Yes, sir.
- Colonel Grady?
- Yes, what is it, Thomas?
What's the longest you ever stayed at these fail-safe points?
The longest I ever stayed was three minutes, but I can tell you it seems like three years.
- This your first time?
- Yes, sir.
- Nervous?
- No, sir.
It's only natural, you know.
I was just calculating fuel, sir.
How is the group holding formation,
Sullivan?
They're right in orbit, sir.
Even Number Six is tucked in.
Old Flynn.
Half man, half bird.
Well, thank you very much, General.
I must say, it was quite a full trip.
- What's that, Colonel?
- Checking, sir.
Okay here.
Send in a K-13.
Something blew in the fault indicator, sir.
We're replacing the whole unit.
The fault indicator is our master control.
It tells us if something goes wrong in any of these other components.
- Did something go wrong?
- No sign of it.
We'll know as soon as they replace the unit.
Sir, the fail-safe box.
There must be some mistake there.
Check Omaha.
Can't get through, Colonel. Interference.
What'd you mean, you can't get through?
What kind of interference?
I don't know, sir.
It's a kind I never heard before.
Well, try another band. Try all of them.
Can't get through, Colonel.
They must be trying to keep us from getting our "go" signal.
Well, they're too late for that.
Request permission to authenticate on secondary channel.
Permission granted.
Order confirmed.
Request permission to verify, sir.
Permission granted.
- Code sequence correct for today, sir.
- Signal is go.
We will now both open our operational orders.
Ready for approach and penetration orders, sir.
So you say these alerts happen half a dozen times a month?
About that. Not usually so dramatic.
- We rarely get to the fail-safe point.
- Well, I'd be a nervous wreck.
Well, so would I if I had to make a speech in Congress.
- Oh, yeah?
- General Bogan?
That blip up there at 10:00.
It's headed into Russia.
And that is why some people advocate a return to manned bombers for a first-strike retaliation, rather than missiles.
They are slower and therefore give more time for evaluation and analysis.
The rockets have the defects of their virtues.
They are too quick.
They allow too little time for thought.
Now I find this point of view old-fashioned.
By the very nature of modern warfare, the...
Put that on polar projection.
- Colonel Cascio.
- Yes, sir?
- Get me the President.
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Buck, the translator. They sent for me.
- May I see your identification, sir?
Buck, it says you have a small scar on your left wrist. May I see it, please?
Oh, yeah.
- Dog bit me when I was a kid.
- Yes, sir.
Hello, Buck. How's your Russian today
Fine, sir,
I guess.
Good. We may need it.
Hang on, Jennie. It's a long way down.
Tell Joe nothing leaks to the newspapers, nothing. Not yet, anyway.
I'll call the Vice President and tell him what's up. He'll know what to do.
On second thought, we'd better tell the press something.
Have Joe tell them it's urgent, but not a bone-breaker so far.
And off the record, no leaks.
Any leaks on this, the guy and his paper are dead now and forever, you got that?
I'll tell Joe in just those words.
Now then, who's at the Pentagon briefing today I want them in on this.
Secretary of Defense. Chiefs of Staff.
That Professor Groeteschele they like so much, he's giving the lecture.
- Is Blackie there?
- There's a General Black.
That's Blackie. I'm glad he's there.
We went to college together.
Got a brain and says what he thinks.
Okay, Jennie, that's all for now. Get to work.
And tell them to turn up the air-conditioning.
It's hot as hell down here.
We're far enough down. Maybe it is hell.
- You know what's happened, Buck?
- No, sir.
One of our Vindicator groups got a wrong signal.
They took off to bomb Moscow.
We've got to stop it.
Easier said than done.
Buck, we've got a little time.
Not much, but a little, so relax.
Easier said than done, sir.
If things get really hot,
I might have to use the direct phone to the Kremlin. That's where you'll come in.
- But let's hope we don't get that far.
- I hope not, sir.
- General Bogan from Omaha, sir.
- Put him on.
Group Six is now about 200 miles past fail-safe, Mr President.
We still can't make contact.
- Do you know what went wrong?
- No, sir, we do not.
Why can't you raise them by radio?
We don't know for sure, sir.
We've tried all frequencies.
We just can't make contact.
- Why?
- I don't know.
We had a flash on the board just before it happened and the fault indicator blew out at the same time.
The Russians may be jamming their reception with some new device we know nothing about.
Why would they do that? Is it customary?
No, sir, but it's possible.
In other words, it's possible the fail-safe mechanism might be giving them a "go" signal at the same time they can't reach you for positive confirmation.
It's possible. It's not probable, but...
Is it possible?
Yes, sir.
All right. Now, if we do regain radio contact, will the bombers respond to an order to return?
If we can reach them within the next five minutes.
After that, their orders are to disregard any verbal command.
If I talk to them? Even from me?
Your voice can be imitated by the enemy, sir. Our men have been drilled in that.
Once they're beyond a certain point they're not to trust any verbal transmission.
What's our next step then, General, if we follow standard procedure?
We already have fighter planes in the air.
The next step would be to order the fighters after the bombers, to raise them visually and divert them from their course.
What if the bombers don't respond, then what?
The fighters would be ordered to shoot them down.
Who gives that order?
You do, sir.
Thank you, General. I'll be back to you.
Get me Mr Swenson in the Pentagon.
Swenson here.
Mr Secretary, I have a decision to make.
It's my decision, and I'll make it, but I want the advice of you and your people and I need it fast.
The President says he may have to order our fighters to shoot down Group Six.
He wants our opinion.
I oppose it, sir, on the grounds that it's premature.
Our planes have not yet reached Soviet territory.
They're still hundreds of miles away.
We've got to do it and fast.
Right now before it's too late.
Might be too late anyway.
Those fighters swung away from the bombers when they got the all clear.
They've been flying in opposite directions.
But they're faster than the Vindicators.
Not that much faster.
I'm not sure they can catch up in time.
They can go to afterburners.
That'll increase their speed.
And use up their fuel?
They'll never be able to get back.
They'll go down in the ocean.
- We've got to try it.
- Suppose they do catch up?
Why do they have to attack?
Can't they signal?
Our men have been trained to expect anything from the enemy.
Even sending up his own fighter planes disguised as ours.
They're good men. We've seen to that.
If their orders are attack, the only way you're gonna stop them is to shoot them down.
We've got no alternative.
This minute the Russians are watching their boards trying to figure out what we're up to.
If we can't convince them it's an accident which we're trying to correct by any means, we're going to have something on our hands that nobody bargained for and only a lunatic wants.
Mr President, it is our opinion that the fighters should be ordered in.
Thank you.
General Bogan, please.
Yes, Mr President?
The fighters are to overtake the Vindicators and, if necessary, shoot them down.
Sir, it will be necessary.
I know that, General. Order them in.
Colonel, order the fighters to attack Group Six.
They don't have a prayer of catching them, sir.
That is an order.
But it's the Arctic Ocean they'll go down in, General.
They'll freeze to death before they get their chutes off.
Colonel, get on the horn and give that order.
Every second you wait takes them farther away.
We're killing them, General, and they haven't got a chance.
This is Fighter Direction.
We are in voice communication with Tangle-Abel-One.
You can talk to them on Channel 7, single side band.
Do I tell them in code or in the clear?
In the clear.
Tangle-Abel-One, this is Colonel Cascio at Ultimate One.
This is Tangle-Abel-One.
I read you five-by-five.
Group Six has flown through the fail-safe point and is on an attack course towards Moscow.
It is a mistake. Repeat, it is a mistake.
Go to afterburners and overtake and attack Group Six.
Roger.
Go to afterburners and overtake and attack Group Six.
Did you all hear that order?
Overtake the Vindicators?
Who are they kidding?
All we got is a 50-mile-an-hour edge on them, and they're halfway to Moscow already.
You heard the man. We go to afterburners.
And use what to run this aeroplane? Spit?
By the time we run out of gas, they'll only be 1,000 miles away.
Man, that's organisation.
All right, cut the chatter, we're wasting time.
On the mark, go to afterburners.
Five, four, three, two, one, mark.
Shall I alert Air-Sea Rescue, sir?
No. No point.
Bring up the fighters on the board in tight scale.
Yes, sir.
Beautiful.
Fighters on their way, sir.
Thank you.
Buck, let's hope this all blows over in the next few minutes.
But if it doesn't, we're going to get to know each other very well.
I want you to listen to every conversation
I have, try to get to know how I think.
- It might come in handy.
- Yes, sir.
- How did General Bogan sound to you?
- Sir?
Did he sound worried? Confident? Scared?
Well, not... Not scared.
A little worried, I guess.
Bogan's an old-time flier, but he's not afraid of all this new equipment.
If he's worried, I'm worried.
You know Mr Swenson, the Secretary of Defence?
I've read about him, sir.
You won't be able to tell much from his voice. He's hard as a rock.
But we listen to him, Buck.
- If he gives advice, we take it.
- Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Will you put the war conference room at the Pentagon and General Bogan in Omaha on a conference line with me?
Yes, sir.
Ready, sir.
- Mr Swenson?
- Yes, Mr President.
If our fighters have to shoot down the Vindicators, the worst is over.
For us, anyway.
I want your people now to consider what we do if they can't shoot them down.
I'm putting you on the intercom so everything you say can be heard here and in Omaha.
General Bogan has Mr Knapp of Amalgamated Electronics and Congressman Raskob with him.
They have my permission to listen in and say anything they want.
Right, sir.
Gentlemen, we've got four questions to answer and not a hell of a lot of time.
First, what happened?
Second, what do we do about it?
Third, what are the Russians going to think of all this?
And fourth, what are they going to do about it?
Please keep the discussion to those points.
Mechanical failure. That's what happened.
A double mechanical failure?
Do you know the odds against that, sir?
- Maybe someone went berserk.
- It doesn't matter.
Something failed. A man, a machine.
It was bound to happen, and it did.
Maybe we'll never know why or what.
It doesn't matter now.
- Mr Secretary.
- Yes, General Bogan.
Mr Knapp here knows as much about electronic gear as anyone.
He'd like to say something.
The more complex an electronic system gets, the more accident-prone it is.
- Sooner or later, it breaks down.
- What breaks down?
A transistor blows, a condenser burns out.
Sometimes they just get tired, like people.
Mr Knapp overlooks one factor.
The machines are supervised by humans.
Even if the machine fails, a human being can always correct the mistake.
I wish you were right.
But the fact is, the machines work so fast, they are so intricate, the mistakes they make are so subtle that very often, a human being just can't know whether a machine is lying or telling the truth.
Well, maybe this time there wasn't any failure.
Maybe the Russians have come up with a way to mask the real position of Group Six.
Maybe Group Six is flying back to the States right this minute.
Then what's on the board? Northern lights?
Maybe a group of Soviet planes, up there for just that reason.
To convince us that we've accidentally launched a bomber group against them.
- For what purpose?
- As an excuse to retaliate.
If they wanted to do that, they wouldn't need an excuse. They'd simply attack.
This way, they've made us commit a group of our fighter planes, our first line of defense.
They've made us kill our own men.
I disagree with Colonel Cascio's analysis.
I think we have to assume that it is our accident and not their plan.
I go along with you, General.
Yes, Saunders?
A report on what the Russians have in the air, sir. Seven bomber groups.
- Is that unusual?
- No, that's normal for them.
About like us.
What kind of course are they on?
Normal patrol patterns inside their own borders.
They do have a large number of fighters in the air, sir.
Abnormally large.
Almost half their fighter strength.
They're having the same problem with Group Six that we had with the UFO.
They don't know what it is, why it's there or who it belongs to.
My guess is that they know all about Group Six.
They saw it fly to the fail-safe point.
They've seen that happen plenty of times.
They know the procedure. So far, no sweat.
And when they saw it fly past...
They sent up their fighter planes, just in case.
I don't think they'll take any action unless their border is crossed.
Agreed.
That puts it up to the fighters.
In my opinion, they will take no action at all.
They are not going to just sit there,
Professor.
I think if our bombers get through, the Russians will surrender.
Who's this professor, Mr Secretary?
What's he doing there?
Professor Groeteschele is a civilian advisor to the Pentagon, General.
Will you explain your statement, Professor?
The Russian aim is to dominate the world.
They think that Communism must succeed eventually if the Soviet Union is left reasonably intact.
They know that a war would leave the Soviet Union utterly destroyed.
Therefore, they would surrender.
But suppose they feel they can knock us off first?
They know we might have a doomsday system.
Missiles that will go into action days, even weeks, after a war is over and destroy an enemy even after that enemy has already destroyed us.
Maybe they think that even capitalists aren't that insane.
To want to kill after they themselves have been killed.
These are Marxist fanatics, not normal people.
They do not reason the way you reason,
General Black.
They're not motivated by human emotions such as rage and pity.
They are calculating machines.
They will look at the balance sheet, and they will see they cannot win.
Then you suggest doing what?
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- The Russians will surrender and the threat of Communism will be over forever.
That's a lot of hogwash. Don't kid yourself.
There'll be Russian generals who will react just as I would, the best defense is a good offense.
They see trouble coming up, take my word for it, they'll attack and they won't give a damn what Marx said.
Mr Secretary, I am convinced that the moment the Russians know bombs will fall on Moscow, they will surrender.
They know that whatever they do then, they cannot escape destruction.
Don't you see, sir? This is our chance.
We never would have made the first move deliberately but Group Six has made it for us, by accident.
We must take advantage of it.
History demands it.
We must advise the President not to recall those planes.
They're flaming hot.
He's firing anyway.
There goes Number Two.
Mr President, the fighters have not succeeded.
They've gone down into the sea.
What are the chances of our bombers getting through to Moscow?
We've made the calculations a hundred times.
What they have in the way of defense is what our planes are capable of doing.
The Vindicators fly so fast, the Russians won't be able to use all their defensive apparatus.
One or two of the bombers will get through.
Thank you.
Buck, I'm going to talk to the Soviet Premier now.
You'll translate what he says to me.
He'll have his own translator telling him what I say,
- but I want something more from you.
- Yes, sir, whatever I can do.
I think the Premier will be saying what he means, he usually does.
But sometimes, there's more in a mars voice than in his words.
And there are words in one language that don't carry the same weight in another.
- You... You follow me?
- Well, I think so, sir.
It's very important the Premier and I understand each other.
I don't have to tell you how important.
So I want to know not only what he's saying, but what you think he's feeling.
Any inflection of his voice, any tone, any emotion that adds to his words,
I want you to let me know.
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.
I know you will, Buck, it's all any of us can do.
And don't be afraid to say what you think.
Don't be afraid all this is too big for you, Buck.
It's big all right, but it still depends on what each of us does.
History lesson number one.
I'll talk to Moscow now.
It's the Premier, sir.
Mr Chairman, this is the President of the United States.
Do you hear me clearly?
Fine, Mr President.
How are you?
Mr Chairman, I'm calling you on a matter of great urgency.
I hope it turns out to be a small matter, but it's the first time it's happened and if it's misunderstood, it could be...
Does it have to do with the aircraft we have detected flying towards Russia?
Yes, Mr Chairman.
I suppose it's another of your off-course reconnaissance flights.
And Mr President, we have warned you again and again that this constant flying of armed aircraft...
- This is a mistake, a serious mistake.
...over Soviet territory cannot...
I say, it's a mistake.
Very well. Tell me. Tell me the mistake.
A group of our bombers, each loaded with two 20-megaton bombs, is flying towards your country.
We shall watch with great interest while you recall them.
So far, we have been unable to recall them.
Are the planes being flown by crazy men?
We're not sure.
It might be a mechanical failure.
All I can tell you is that it's an accident.
It's not an attempt to provoke war.
It's not part of a general attack.
How do I know you do not have hundreds of other planes coming in so low our radar cannot pick them up?
Because I hope to prove to you that it's an accident.
That we take full responsibility. That we're doing everything we can to correct it.
Go on.
You must have seen that we sent fighter planes to shoot down the bombers.
American fighters to shoot down American bombers?
That is correct.
- And you gave that order?
- I did.
How do I know that the planes were not simply diving to a low altitude to escape our radar?
On our plotting board, the action could only be interpreted as planes out of control.
You have the same equipment we do.
What did it tell you?
It did not tell us what is in your mind,
Mr President.
I'm telling you that.
- And you ask me to believe you?
- You must believe me.
You ask for belief at a curious time.
If we don't trust each other now,
Mr Chairman, there may not be another time.
We saw...
We saw your planes fall into the sea.
I wanted only to hear your explanation.
And whether it was done at your own order.
It is a hard thing to order men to their death, is it not?
It is.
Sir, someone's trying to persuade him it's a trick.
They want him to strike back at once.
Soviet airspace has still not been violated,
Mr President.
But if it is, we will be forced to shoot down your bombers.
And then we will come to full alert with all our missiles and planes.
I understand that. I hope you're able to shoot down our bombers.
But I urge you not to take any steps that cannot be recalled.
You know we must protect ourselves.
You also know that if you launch missiles, we must do the same.
If that happens, there'll be very little left of the world.
I understand.
Is there anything more you wish to say
If I may make a suggestion?
I will arrange to open a conference line between our headquarters in Omaha and your similar officials in the Soviet Union.
We will do all we can to help you.
We do not need your help. We are perfectly capable of defending our country.
As you wish, but I must tell you what my people tell me.
No matter what you do, at least one of the planes will get through to the target.
- What is the target?
- Moscow.
I'll call you back when I see what our fighters do.
How's the formation holding, Sullivan?
Everyone in line, sir.
- How far from the border?
- Two minutes.
We better start spreading out.
Number Six plane in the lead.
- Flynn.
- Right here, Colonel.
- Go to work.
- Roger.
Project the Soviet fighter planes.
Give me tight scale on the Russian border.
- That does it.
- They've crossed the border.
Well, Buck, we're into Soviet territory.
A technical state of war now exists.
Give me Enemy Defense Performance.
This is Enemy Defense Performance Desk,
General Bogan.
How do you read the situation?
Our Number Six plane carrying defensive equipment and masking devices has moved into the lead.
All those new little blips you see are decoys that it's dropped.
Have the Russian fighters launched any missiles yet?
Not yet You'll see their missiles on your scope as tiny dots that appear suddenly and then disappear.
There go some of them now.
You can see they're confused by the decoys.
They're still not grouping where the real planes are.
Can you wipe the decoys off the screen so that we see just their planes and ours?
There you are, General.
They're still going after decoys.
Our boys aren't making it easy for them.
Good.
- They've picked up one of our planes now.
- Get them. Get them.
Knock that off!
This isn't some damn football game, remember that!
That plane's in trouble.
It looks like the Soviets have a very slow missile with a much longer range than we thought they had.
The slowness of speed made our missile calculate they must be drones or decoys so it ignored them and went after the fighters.
We can compensate for that.
The adjustment is minor.
The Premier is on the line, sir.
Yes, Mr Chairman?
We have only a little time left, Mr President.
His voice is different, sir.
It's not angry. It's subdued.
How shall we use this time?
He sounds sorrowful, sad.
What luck are your fighters having?
Luck? No luck at all.
We have shot down only one of your bombers.
Well, what about the other five?
Maybe yes, maybe no.
Your masking devices are better than we had thought.
Hundreds of targets have appeared on the radar.
Perhaps they are decoys.
Perhaps they are real bombers.
Many of my experts are convinced that they are real.
They urge me to release our own bombers at once.
Why don't you, then?
- Good question.
- Why haven't you counterattacked?
I am gambling that you are sincere.
My generals are not so happy with me about this, as I'm sure your generals are not so happy with you.
But there is time for common sense.
I must have proof, Mr President.
Neither of us wants war but we must be convinced that this is truly a mistake, that your intentions are not hostile and that there is a chance for peace.
Mr Chairman, let me ask you something.
Just before our planes took off from their fail-safe point, there was a white flash on our plotting board.
We think this is connected to some mechanical failure that might have activated their "go" signal.
Could this have been caused by your radio interference?
They're arguing with him again, sir, telling him not to answer, the information is too secret.
Was it your jamming that kept us from getting through to our planes?
I do not know about this jamming.
I think he does.
We cannot be responsible for your mechanical failures.
Is it possible? Could it have happened?
You ask for proof, Mr Chairman.
This could be it.
They're arguing back and forth.
"Don't trust you."
"Have to trust you."
"It's a trick."
We're paying for our mutual suspicions,
Mr Chairman,
I realize that, but the wall must be broken.
We have to break it down now.
We can't afford not to trust each other.
We jammed your radios with a special device even I did not know about.
I suppose I must be very proud of our scientists.
It was more effective than anyone dreamed.
But why? Why this time?
We have computers, like yours.
They computed that this time your alert might be real.
On what grounds?
Probability. The law of averages.
They have their own logic.
It is not human, but it is positive, so we listen.
Will you lift the jamming so I can talk to the group commander?
- Will he return on your command?
- There's a chance.
I'll give that order.
General Bogan.
Yes, Mr President.
- Put me through to Group Six, fast.
- Right away, sir.
- What's the group commander's name?
- Colonel Jack Grady, sir.
- Does he have a wife?
- I'll see, sir.
Turkey One, this is Ultimate One.
Can you hear me?
Turkey One, this is Ultimate One.
Can you hear me?
- Yes, sir, he does.
- Find her.
If I can't persuade him, maybe she can.
- Yes, sir.
- Turkey One, this is Ultimate One.
Can you hear me?
Turkey One, this is Ultimate One, can you hear me?
I have an important message.
Turkey One, can you hear me?
Turkey One, can you hear me?
Turkey One, can you hear me?
This is Ultimate One. Can you hear me?
They've stopped jamming us.
This is Turkey One. Turkey One,
I am not authorized to receive messages.
Colonel Grady, this is the President of the United States.
The mission you are flying has been triggered by a mechanical failure.
It is a mistake.
I order you and the other planes to return to your base at once.
Do you hear? At once!
Colonel Grady, I repeat.
This is the President.
I can no longer receive tactical alterations by voice.
I know that, but...
What you're telling me,
I've been specifically ordered not to do!
Damn it, Grady, this is the President!
He's still on, sir.
Mr Chairman, I think it would be wise for you to remove yourself from Moscow so that you'll be out of danger.
It will allow us to continue negotiations even if the worst happens.
I have made those arrangements.
His voice is tougher.
Unfortunately, we cannot remove Moscow.
It remains here, open to your bombs, and when it is destroyed, its people dead because there's no time to evacuate them, where shall we negotiate, Mr President?
Shall I come to Geneva, hat in hand, begging for peace?
I offered you help. You refused it.
I offer it again.
We will help you shoot down the planes.
Set up your conference line.
I'll come back on the phone when I'm a safe distance from Moscow.
Will you activate the Ultimate One/Red One
Touch Phone, please.
Can we stop them, sir?
Fire. Fire.
Before he gets off one of those slow ones.
Colonel, knock that off, or I'll have you taken out of this room.
Two down. Four to go.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?
Every minute we wait works against us.
Now, Mr Secretary.
Now is when we must send in a first strike.
We don't go in for sneak attacks.
We had that done to us at Pearl Harbor.
And the Japanese were right to do it.
From their point of view, we were their mortal enemy.
As long as we existed, we were a deadly threat to them.
Their only mistake was that they failed to finish us at the start and they paid for that mistake at Hiroshima.
- You're talking about a different kind of war.
- Exactly.
This time, we can finish what we start.
And if we act now, right now, our casualties will be minimal.
Do you know what you're saying?
Do you believe that Communism is not our mortal enemy?
You're justifying murder.
Yes, to keep from being murdered.
In the name of what? To preserve what?
Even if we do survive, what are we, better than what we say they are?
What gives us the right to live, then?
What makes us worth surviving,
Groeteschele?
- That we are ruthless enough to strike first?
- Yes!
Those who can survive are the only ones worth surviving.
Fighting for your life isn't the same as murder.
Where do you draw the line once you know what the enemy is?
How long would the Nazis have kept it up,
General, if every Jew they came after had met them with a gun in his hand?
But I learnt from them, General Black.
Oh, I learnt.
You learnt too well, Professor.
You learnt so well that now there's no difference between you and what you want to kill.
Yes, Mr President
Contact our ambassador to Moscow.
Also the Soviet delegate to the United Nations.
Hook them onto my line.
When the Soviet Premier comes back on the phone, put us all on together.
Yes, Mr President
Is the Touch Phone open between Omaha and the Soviet command headquarters?
- Yes, sir, all ready.
- Keep it open.
General Black.
Yes, Mr President.
Blackie,
- remember your Old Testament?
- A little.
Remember the story of the sacrifice of Abraham?
Old what's-his-name used to use it in chapel at least twice a year.
I remember, sir.
Keep it in mind the next few hours.
Blackie, I need your help.
Get out to Andrews Field right away.
Orders will be waiting for you there.
Yes, sir.
Blackie, are Katherine and the kids in New York?
Yes, sir.
I may be asking a great deal of you.
I'll do whatever you say.
Good luck, Blackie.
- General Bogan.
- Yes, Mr President?
I've activated the Touch Phone between you and the Soviet command.
- Will you test it, please?
- Yes, sir.
This is General Bogan,
Strategic Air Command, Omaha.
I am the translator for Marshal Nevsky.
Marshal Nevsky sends his greetings.
The same to him.
Our reception is five-by-five.
How do you read us?
We read you five-by-five.
One moment, please.
Mr President, we're through to them.
Thank you, General.
Will you put me on your public address system so everyone can hear what I say
I want the Russians to be able to hear as well.
Yes, sir.
Ready, sir.
Gentlemen, this is the President of the United States.
Whatever orders I give to American personnel are to be considered direct orders from the Commander in Chief.
They are to be obeyed fully, without reservation and at once.
We must do everything we can to prevent our planes from attacking Moscow.
The Soviet Premier has behaved as I believe
I would under similar conditions.
He has delayed retaliation.
I think he believes this is an accident.
But we must convince him and his chief advisors that it is.
I therefore order every American to cooperate fully with Soviet officers in shooting down our invading planes.
You are to give whatever information they request
Any hesitation, any withholding of information can have the most tragic consequences.
I cannot emphasize this too strongly.
Are there any questions?
Gentlemen, I expect you to conduct yourselves as patriots.
And I wish you success.
Do the missiles on these bombers have both infrared and radar homing capabilities?
A number of our fighter planes have been destroyed by a missile that seems to home not on the infrared source, but on the radar transmitter. Is it possible?
Colonel Cascio will answer your question.
Answer the question, Colonel.
That is a direct order. An order, Colonel!
Colonel!
Just a moment, please. Major Handel.
General Bogan.
Sergeant Collins, on the double!
You're backup man on fire control, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Do our Vindicator missiles have both infrared- and radar-seeking capacity?
Yes, sir.
Loud and clear!
They've got to know we're on the level!
It has both capacities, sir.
Can the radar-seeking mechanism be overloaded by increasing the strength of the signal?
Tell them!
Yes, sir.
It can be overloaded by increasing the power output and sliding through radar frequencies as fast as possible, what happens is the firing mechanism reads the higher amperage as proximity to the target and detonates the warhead.
Thank you, General Bogan.
We will be back to you.
That's all, Sergeant.
What does it mean?
We've told them how to blow up our air-to-air missiles and with them our planes.
They're picking us up.
Thomas, send out the code for the alternate flight plan.
We're going down to the floor.
They're trying to avoid the fighters by going too low for their radar.
I'm sorry, General, I...
I don't know what happened. I just...
I just couldn't do it. It was like a...
I don't know, a fit or something.
Colonel, I...
Forget it.
Who could have expected this situation?
General. General, I...
I think this is all a trap.
They wanted this to happen.
We know they've been trying to foul up our fail-safe signal.
I think that we should tell the President it's a trap.
They're just using the time to get their missiles ready and fly their bombers into position.
We have no evidence of that.
They could be flying their bombers in the grass.
They could have fired missiles already and put them up in the orbit of known satellites where we couldn't detect them.
Remember. We computed that problem.
We decided satellites could be used to mask missiles.
We computed a lot of problems.
I'm not reporting anything
I don't know for sure.
I think we should recommend a full-strength attack.
That is not our decision! The Pentagon...
They don't know what we know.
They're not soldiers anymore.
They're politicians.
They don't care what happens to us.
They make a mistake, that's politics.
They send out men to be killed, General.
For what?
To make some lousy deal, to sell us out.
Save the world, save us.
Save our country before they destroy it with their stinking politics.
Order a first strike, General.
Put an end to it once and for all.
- You have the power. You can do it!
- Colonel!
You are talking treason. Stop it now, or I'll have you put under arrest.
General Bogan, this is Marshal Nevsky.
Yes, Marshal.
Can you give us the longitude and latitude of the three planes left in the air?
We can do that, but we can't give you their altitude.
The signals we're getting now are too distorted.
Will you please give us the position of the three planes?
We can fly fighters at various altitudes.
Can do.
Gentlemen, I am taking over command of this post at the specific order of the President of the United States.
He has long been aware that General Bogan is mentally unbalanced and has warned me to observe him closely.
The negotiations which General Bogan has been conducting with the enemy are the acts of a lunatic.
By the direct authority of the President,
I now command you to take all orders from...
Colonel? We got orders, Colonel.
You make a fuss, we'll kill you.
You're a traitor. You're worse than anybody.
You wear the uniform.
You have men under your command.
You're in the field, but you want them dead before they find you out!
You want me dead!
I saw it this morning when you found me with those people.
I'm better than you are!
It's a mistake.
You're betraying us all!
You're making a mistake!
I'm better than you are. You're a traitor.
You're betraying us all!
- Marshal Nevsky?
- Yes, sir.
I am now prepared to give you the longitude and latitude of our bombers in accordance with your request.
I was aware of your difficulty,
General Bogan.
We have had such problems ourselves.
I await your information.
Major Handel.
- General, you better have a doctor...
- They've got another one.
Sit down, anyway. That was a bad knock.
Anyone could crack under the strain.
Well, if you ask me, he was a boy on the edge...
He was a good soldier.
The Soviet Premier is coming back on the line, sir.
The ambassador and the Soviet delegate are already on.
- Have they been told?
- Yes, sir, as you said.
Good.
Jay, where are you?
On the top floor of the embassy in Moscow,
Mr President
- Where are you, Mr Lentov?
- In the UN building in New York.
I suppose there is a reason for your ambassador and Comrade Lentov to join us.
There is, Mr Chairman.
Then let's get on with it.
His voice is firmer, sir. Final.
Like he's made up his mind.
In a few minutes, the bombs may be falling.
I have brought our forces to a condition of full readiness.
Unless we can satisfy one another,
I must release those forces.
So, what do you propose, Mr President?
Do your people think there is still a chance of bringing down the bombers?
There is always a chance.
But I'm asking you, what if they cannot?
What will you do?
Have you made a decision?
Yes.
It's my decision and I take full responsibility.
- Mr Swenson, are you on the line?
- Yes, Mr President.
- General Bogan?
- Yes, sir.
This is what will happen if even one of the bombers gets through.
It will drop two 20-megaton bombs on Moscow.
- Jay
- Yes, Mr President?
You might hear the sound of the engines just before the bombs drop, maybe not.
In any case, you'll hear the defensive missiles going off.
Right after that, the bombs will explode.
I'm told that what we will hear at this end will be a high, shrill sound.
That will be the ambassador's phone melting from the heat of the fireball.
When we hear that sound, the ambassador will be dead.
You understand, Mr Ambassador, you're to stay exactly where you are.
Yes, Mr President
He's got to attack.
Is this your proposal?
To sacrifice one American for five million Russians?
No, no, no. Listen to me! Listen!
I've ordered a Vindicator bomber into the air from Washington.
In a few minutes, it will be flying over New York City.
It is carrying two 20-megaton bombs.
The moment I know that Moscow has been hit,
I will order that plane to drop its bombs.
It will use the Empire State Building for ground zero.
When we hear the shriek of Mr Lentov's phone melting, we will know that he is gone and with him, New York.
Holy Mother of God.
No.
He can't do it.
What else can he do?
I don't know any other way,
Mr Chairman, unless...
Unless you feel the offer itself is enough.
Showing our intentions.
Would you think it enough?
If Russian bombers were flying against New York, could you accept only my good intentions?
No.
I believe this was an accident.
But I also believe your action is the only way out.
I ask you to believe I wish it were not so.
Yes.
Well, we can still hope
I won't have to take that action.
How close to target?
Fourteen minutes, sir.
How many planes left?
Just us and Number Six.
- Flynn.
- Still here, Grady.
What's your condition?
Slight wing damage from ordinary flak.
That's all.
Speed down to 1,350. Drag even.
- How many of the decoys do you have left?
- How many do you need?
Well, I got the bombs. You don't.
I want you to take some of those fighters off my tail.
Will do.
- Billy?
- Yeah?
I depend on you.
General Bogan, can you explain this manoeuvre?
One of your planes has just appeared again.
It's standard procedure, Marshal Nevsky.
That's our Number Six plane, the decoy plane.
It's just trying to draw your fighters away from our other plane carrying the bombs.
I see.
It carries only defensive equipment.
You don't have to worry about it.
Thank you.
We shall try for a kill in any case.
She'll scatter your forces, Marshal.
You don't have time for that.
I tell you, it doesn't carry any bombs.
You don't have to worry about it!
You're letting our other plane get through!
I told you!
There has been a...
Marshal Nevsky has collapsed.
It appears... Well, I don't know.
General Koniev is now in command.
Bogan, what's happened?
Marshal Nevsky sent his fighters after a plane that carried no bombs.
That means our Number One plane will almost certainly get through.
The marshal realized that
It was too much for him.
General Bogan, this is General Koniev.
Do you have the remaining plane on your screen?
No, sir, we do not.
We cannot see it on our radar, and it is flying so fast, our antiaircraft is useless.
- I must assume the plane will get through.
- Yes.
I intend to focus all our remaining rockets on the estimated path of the plane and fire them all off at once.
Our hope is to set up a thermonuclear barrier that nothing can penetrate.
That might work. It's wor'th a chance.
You speak English very well, General.
I was liaison to your headquarters in London during the war.
I was stationed right outside of London.
Yes, I know. With the 8th Air Force.
Did you like London?
Very much.
So did I.
The great cities are those where one can walk.
I would walk all the time in London.
Wherever you turn, there's history.
- General, are you in Moscow now?
- No.
I was ordered to leave.
Is your...
It's a hard day.
Yes, a hard day.
Goodbye, my friend.
Goodbye, my friend.
- Colonel Grady, sir.
- What is it, Thomas?
The infrared indicator shows a large number of ground-to-air rockets ignited ahead of us.
They should show on the scope anytime now.
What do you know about those rockets?
They're no different from ours, sir.
Designed to home in on heat-producing engines, like an aeroplane.
They can't be aiming them at us.
We're too low. They'd blow themselves up.
What are they doing with them?
- General Bogan?
- Yes.
They found Mrs Grady. She's standing by.
Mr President, we have Grady's wife.
Can we get through to him?
If he follows procedure, he'll contact us when he gets within range of the target.
Those are his orders so that we know how to evaluate the strike.
- Well, he's been following orders so far.
- Yes, sir.
Keep your fingers crossed.
- Thomas.
- Yes, sir.
Would their rockets follow missiles, too?
I don't see why not.
A missile produces heat.
So I think I know what they're gonna do.
Explode the rockets on top of us, hope to knock us down with a blast.
They can do it, too. But how many air-to-air missiles we got left?
- Two.
- Okay.
Now, the minute you see those rockets ignite on the scope, you fire our missiles and guide them for maximum elevation straight up.
- Straight up?
- Yeah.
Maybe their rockets will follow the missiles, explode too high to hurt us.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Grady, we're in range.
We have to report in.
Watch that scope.
Ultimate One, this is Turkey One.
Ultimate One, this is Turkey One.
- Can you hear me?
- Grady, this is General Bogan.
Keep receiving no matter what you hear.
Do you understand? Keep receiving.
Jack.
Jack, this is Helen.
Jack, it's Helen. Do you recognize my voice?
It's not a trick. It's me.
Jack, you must turn back.
You mustn't drop those bombs.
- Do you hear me?
- Is it really your wife?
They've started their rockets.
- Fire one.
- Jack.
Do you hear what I'm saying? Jack!
Fire two.
Keep them at least 2,500 feet above the rockets.
- Yes, sir.
- Jack.
There's no war! We're fine!
You must turn back!
They're at 18,000.
- Go! Go!
This is not a trick.
- 20,000 feet.
- The rockets are following them!
Give them as much boost as you can.
The higher, the better.
- I've never lied to you, have I?
I couldn't, no matter what anybody did to me, I wouldn't.
- Please. You've got to believe me!
80,000 feet.
- Jack, there is no war.
- They're slowing down.
- We'd better get some altitude.
- Jack, please, answer me, please!
- Answer me!
Jack, do you...
Answer me, please!
You can't trust it, sir!
We gotta get out of here!
No!
Hang on!
Their rockets are catching up!
We're gonna catch some of it.
So hold tight.
There they go.
Think we'll make it now.
How many minutes to Moscow?
Seven minutes, sir.
Look...
We have our choice about what altitude to drop the bombs from.
It's about the only choice we do have now.
Blast gave us enough radiation.
At best we'd only last a couple of days.
So I'm taking her in low.
When we're over the target, climbing to 5,000 feet.
Bombs are set to go at 5,000.
We'll go with them.
Okay?
What the hell.
There's nothing to go home to anyway.
General Stark, are there any papers or documents in New York which are absolutely essential to the running of the United States?
General Stark?
No, sir.
There are important documents, but none of them absolutely essential.
Will there be any warning given?
A lot of lives could be saved if people had a few minutes.
On this short notice, an alert to a big city would do more harm than good.
All you'd produce is panic.
What about this?
Maybe...
Maybe he doesn't know his wife is there.
He knows.
Gentlemen, we are wasting time.
I've been making a few rough calculations based on the effect of two 20-megaton bombs dropped on New York City in the middle of a normal workday.
I estimate the immediate dead at about three million.
I include in this figure those buried beneath the collapsed buildings.
Wouldn't make any difference,
Admiral Wilcox, whether they reached a shelter or not.
They would die just the same.
Add another million or two who'll die within about five weeks.
Now our immediate problem would be the joint one of fire control and excavation.
Excavation not of the dead.
The effort would be wasted there.
But even though there are no irreplaceable government documents in the city, many of our largest corporations keep their records there.
It will be necessary to rescue as many of those records as we can.
Our economy depends on this.
Our economy depends on this.
"And the Lord said," gentlemen,
"he who is without sin,
"let him cast the first stone."
Sir?
May I have a drink, please?
How'd you ever get to be a translator, Buck?
You don't seem the academic type.
I guess I've got this talent for languages, sir.
I hear a language once, I pick it right up.
I don't even know how.
And they found out about it in the army.
- You sound sorry they did.
- Oh, no. Very interesting job.
I mean, sometimes.
Well, you did a good job today, Buck.
Thank you, sir.
All I did was repeat what he said.
You didn't freeze up.
Another man might have.
You're the one who didn't, sir.
I wonder what it's like out.
Looked like rain before.
Radio said it would clear by the afternoon.
The Premier, sir.
Yes, Mr Chairman.
Mr President,
I have ordered our long-range missiles to stand down from their alert.
Only that part of our defense that has a chance of shooting down your bomber is still active.
We do not think we have much of a chance.
I know.
And yet, this was nobody's fault.
I don't agree.
No human being did wrong.
No one here is to be blamed.
We're to blame, both of us.
We let our machines get out of hand.
Still, it was an accident.
Two great cities may be destroyed, millions of innocent people killed.
What do we say to them, Mr Chairman?
"Accidents will happen"?
I won't accept that.
All I know is that as long as we have weapons...
All I know is that men are responsible.
We're responsible for what happens to us.
Today we had a taste of the future.
Do we learn from it, or do we go on the way we have?
What do we do, Mr Chairman?
What do we say to the dead?
I think, if we are men, we must say, this will not happen again.
But do you think it possible with all that stands between us?
We put it there, Mr Chairman, and we're not helpless.
What we put between us, we can remove.
- Mr President?
- Yes, Jay.
I can hear the sound of explosions from the northeast
The sky is very bright, all lit up...
Put me through to General Black.
Yes, Mr President
Blackie.
Yes, Mr President?
Moscow's been destroyed.
Drop your bombs according to plan.
Yes, sir.
You've all been briefed on the mission, so there's nothing more to say.
I have only one last order.
Nobody else is to have anything to do with the dropping of the bombs.
Repeat:
I will fly the plane and release the bombs.
The final act is my own.
On course, sir. Approaching target.
Count down from ten. Give me the signal.
- Now.
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
Mark.
General Black!
Katie, the dream.
The dream!
The matador.
The matador!
The matador.
Me!
Me.
- What is the verdict?
- Guilty, Your Grace.
All of them?
Guilty.
* Farewell, farewell
My pleasure past
* Welcome my present pain
* Welcome the torment in my heart
* To see my love again *
Warrant for the execution of
Sir Henry Norris for adultery with Annee,
Queen of England.
For the execution of Mark Smeaton for the treason of adultery with Annee,
Queen of England.
To the Lieutenant Governor of the Tower of London a warrant for the execution...
...of Annee, Queen of England.
For adultery and treason.
To be burned or beheaded at the King's pleasure.
Annee, Queen of England.
My wife.
My wife, Cromwell.
She has borne you a useless daughter and a dead son.
When we married she promised me a son.
I must have a son to rule when I am dead.
God guided the conscience and answered prayers of the King.
- He will not let you condemn unjustly.
- Then why do I hesitate?
Is the hesitation from God?
Or is He telling me you must die, you who found evidence and arranged trial?
I care only that the King rules absolutely.
The Queen despised her marriage and indulged her carnal lust.
Betrayed me?
Did she, Cromwell? Did she?
Your Grace, the Queen betrayed you and stands condemned.
The warrant is before you.
If she betrayed me, she must die.
If I am to rule, keep my sanity, and hold England off the rocks, and as you say, God would not allow me to condemn unjustly.
If I question that, I question my whole life and all I’ve done.
At times, I do question it.
Write it down.
Write down Henry Rex and it's done.
I’ve condemned men before, nobles and peasants, why not a queen?
She struck down a few herself or driven me to do it for her.
It's only...
It’s only that when you've held a woman in your arms and longed for her when she's away, suffered with her and waited with her for the outcome of the child bed...
You promised me a son.
Annee.
Annee!
She's new.
Boleyn's youngest daughter.
Newly returned from the French court.
Do you like her, Kate?
Shall we keep her here at court to cheer you?
Whatever you command, My Lord.
And suppose I command you to give me a son?
- Would to God I could, Henry.
- Amen.
But you cAnneot, because our marriage is accursed in heaven and hell, madam.
Play on. Play on.
The Queen wishes it and I command it.
Play!
When I call for it, tell the musicians to play my galliard.
And see to it, More, that there is no argument.
My Lord Bishop.
Your Majesty.
- If it please Your Grace...
- No politics, Wolsey.
Go and commune with the devil while I dance.
No, just a simple domestic matter.
A wedding.
Any man who marries when he can be free is a fool.
Here. Here is the couple.
Young Percy, Northumberland's son.
He's a member of my household.
And Annee Boleyn.
Their parents agreed.
Have they your permission to marry?
- I’ve told them...
- No.
- "No", did Your Grace say?
- No.
- But it is a love match.
- Un-match them, Wolsey, unmatch them.
And send the Boleyns, father, mother, son and eldest daughter, back to their castle in Kent, and send Annee with them tonight.
Yes, sir.
I’m bored, Wolsey.
I’m bored with the court.
Bored with my Spanish cow.
I shall go hunting in the beautiful country of Kent.
- Your Grace.
- No ceremony.
I have a mind to put you all to shame.
You're short of breath.
- A misspent life, sir.
- No doubt.
Brereton, you keep time like a deaf man.
- Your Grace has learned my secret.
- Norfolk, sit by the fire at your age.
- Better to lie by it, Your Grace.
- Yes, but with whom?
Percy, you have feet of lead, a northern clodhopper.
With your permission,
Mistress Annee, will you teach the King how they dance at the court of France?
There is nothing France can teach England, Your Majesty.
Well said.
Well said.
The galliard. Play.
My Lord?
Tell Boleyn
I wish to speak to him privately.
- Yes, My Lord.
- And then prepare for a journey.
- A journey?
- Yes.
For where the dove is the hawk will not be far behind.
To Hever Castle in Kent.
Mary, it must be said, the King wishes to see me alone.
He asked not to see me?
Not directly.
That could mean he's finished with me.
Has he? Tell me the truth.
One never gets used to these things.
There is always a hell to go through.
When a girl gives herself so completely...
You know why I gave myself to the King.
Since I opened my bedroom door to him, you've lived well by it.
Steward of Tonbridge and Penshurst.
Sheriff of Bradsted. Viscount.
And now King's Treasurer.
You don't want to lose those revenues, do you, Father?
Mary, I have always loved you.
All those things are true.
The King was generous to me because you were generous to him.
But you're a fool because you gave him everything and asked for nothing.
What His Majesty is denied, he goes mad to obtain.
What he gets freely, he despises.
You have lost him.
I can't help you.
Go now and cause no trouble.
I will not have you put the rest of us at risk.
- What ails you?
- Ask our beloved father.
Father, the Lord Cardinal is here.
- Boleyn. I see you've told the lady.
- Yes, My Lord.
- And Annee?
- No.
- Why not? The King is almost here.
- Like you, I encouraged her with Percy.
It never entered my head that the King would look at her.
My Lord, the King is here.
- There is no time...
- Leave the girl to me.
Tell the King what rubbish you please, but give me time.
As for young Percy, he'll do as I bid him.
Whoa, boy.
Your Majesty.
Only your King, Thomas.
No ceremony. Only your Henry.
This is a great honour.
From Harry Percy?
Where is Annee, Lady Elizabeth?
I found this in her room.
- How is the Vicar of Hell this morning?
- Warm enough, Your Majesty.
To be active on the King's business generates a certain heat.
Yes, with your feet on the devil's fender and your buttocks toasting at God's altar.
- Has he spoken to you?
- He has, Your Grace.
Good. Good.
And when may I smell this pretty posy of yours?
If you mean Annee, sir, she is still at her mirror.
A new dress, nervous fingers. If you could give her half an hour, perhaps?
- We have this whole day, Thomas.
- I’ve a new pack of hounds and there's a clump of deer in the meadow.
- We'll see one, hunt the other.
- Good hunting.
- You'll not be with us?
- It appears there are two poor souls who seek religious comfort.
I must go.
Indeed, My Lord Cardinal, indeed.
God's work must come first.
And, who knows, there may be a little worldly profit attached.
Oh, Your Majesty...
Find them, bring them to me.
Thomas, a private word with you before I meet Annee.
Yes, Your Grace?
There is always a temptation for a man in my position to regard the nation as his own trough and to eat from one end to the other.
- Not Your Grace.
- Why not? Who can say no to me?
Except God, and He does, Thomas.
I kneel. I pray. He answers.
But can that be seen to be so?
Why else would His Holiness the Pope have named you Defender of the Faith?
True. True.
I am a religious man.
I want to do right by God and the Church, and the people and myself, and you, Thomas.
Do you follow?
That's a swathe of folk to satisfy, if it includes God, Your Grace.
It includes your two daughters, Thomas.
- Are they friends?
- Yes.
And do they exchange confidences, do you think?
Do they whisper together at night secrets about me, perhaps?
Who knows, Your Grace?
The one you have had, the other you desire.
Will Annee have me, and for myself?
- I want an honest answer.
- She's no fool, My Lord.
Good. Good.
What I do is God's will and my prayer always is that He will allow no thought to enter my heart or mind that is not His will.
He has...
He has never failed me, Thomas.
But Your Majesty realizes this might seem as...
As what?
As an excuse to do as you please, to eat the trough dry.
I’m the King of England.
When I pray, God answers.
Yes, Your Grace.
And let no man dare question that.
Or woman.
Again.
- I’m angry with myself.
- Why?
Well, think of the years I spent at the French court.
I was surrounded by gallant, captivating, exquisite French courtiers and I loved none of them.
No sooner do I return than I fall in love with a...
- "Clodhopper", said His Majesty.
- He was right.
No mAnneers, can't dance, can't sing, can't...
- Can put his arms around you.
- Not as well as I’ve known it done.
But they are the arms I want, for some God knows what reason.
I love your awkwardness.
But if we love enough to marry, we must keep nothing back.
So?
- Are we to bed together? Before?
- If you like.
Kiss me.
Are you a virgin?
- I’m a man.
- I know, but are you a virgin?
When we bed together, shall I be your first?
- I...
- Speak out.
Well, I’ll say it frankly as they do in France.
In England we make muddy mysteries of such things as if they were crimes.
We don't come out of a rainbow at 17 and there's no use pretending we do.
You may ask me whatever you like.
- Are you a virgin?
- No.
- In France?
- Yes. And long before.
When I was little,
I was playing with a boy and he threw me down...
The King refuses you permission to marry.
- But...
- Why? Why, My Lord?
Marriages of the nobility are affairs of State.
I was wrong to encourage you.
The King wishes you to marry a daughter of the Earl of Shrewsbury.
I am pledged to Annee.
It is a good match.
I brought you to court. You're a member of my household. You will obey.
The world knew we meant to marry.
Nothing was said against it.
You've heard the King's pleasure against it.
A half grown steer and a leggy girl will not be allowed to overturn the policies of State.
Why was nothing said?
Her father, my father, and you, My Lord Cardinal, who knows the King's business better than himself.
Be silent!
You will obey or your estates will be forfeit.
If you show further disloyalty, it's doubtful how long you'll live.
The Duke of Buckingham lost his head for less. Now go.
You must go.
Kiss me, then.
Don't touch her.
- Be careful of yourself.
- I will, for you.
My Lord, I love him truly and we are pledged to each other.
If you force him to marry elsewhere, although I am only a girl, you'll know you have an enemy.
Madam, you do me wrong.
I have no spleen against you,
I am only a messenger.
Messenger? Who has chosen for me?
When Henry of England turns his eyes on a girl, she can hardly look away.
- The King has asked for me?
- He has.
And sent you to me?
It is sometimes my duty to anticipate his desires.
Even in carnal matters,
My Lord Cardinal?
We have had the King in the bosom of this family for some years.
My sister Mary is with child by him and of no further use.
I shall not go the way of my sister.
You would be wise to anticipate my answer and spare His Majesty any Anneoyance.
I will not be a mistress of the King even with the blessing of a prince of the Church.
- Good sport in Boleyn's woods.
- And in his bowers.
I heard you, Norris.
Well, you two, tell me, man to man, all kingship aside,
- what's the best way to win a maid?
- A maid?
I couldn't swear to it medically, but it's young and it's wild.
My skills are not for the grade of female you seek.
I’m more successful with waiting women.
Don't be modest.
I’ve followed your spoor so close there was scarce time to close the window you left by or change perfumes to put me off the scent.
Speak on, your lure, your most seductive.
- You'll not be offended?
- I’ll be offended if you hold back.
If you truly want her, make her believe that you are potent only with her.
Pretend that you've tried with others.
Gone to bed, kissed hotly, but hung embarrassed and unable.
But with her you rouse up.
You're a man again.
They can't resist that.
They open like...
Never mind the simile.
Yes. What a game. What a ploy.
Dare I ask, has Your Grace ever been refused by a wench?
Who? I? Refused? Why, never.
When I’ve wanted them, I’ve had them.
When I’ve had a wench, I’m cured.
That's general, isn't it?
Your Grace, can you all leave talking of virgins to look at the venison?
Yes, yes. Come, come.
Next to the haunch of a virgin, there's nothing like a haunch of venison.
Do you also offer me up to this royal bull?
You, my father?
And you, my mother?
- Lower your voice!
- Do you know what it is to be in love?
- I love Harry Percy and will marry him.
- You'll have us all dead or disgraced.
Lower your voice.
The royal bull can't force you.
Brother, I must fight. I must.
Do you know what it means when a king asks for you?
I can ask my pregnant and foolish sister.
Turn him away and we can say farewell to all we've worked for.
If our parents had not taken advantage what would've become of us?
If we lose favour, we lose everything.
Then say goodbye to it all, for I will not take the King to my bed!
Your Majesty.
I was so anxious to see you, madam,
I ran ahead.
Have you been faithful to me or lying about with this husband?
Remarkable women you breed, you Howards.
[laughter]
Norfolk, greet your sister.
I’ve brought your brother to make sure I was welcome.
George, you should have hunted with us and not stayed at home with the ladies.
Nan.
- Give me a kiss.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
And now on the lips, sweet Nan.
I’ve been taking medicines for a cold.
My breath is foul, Your Grace.
Your health is very dear to us.
You must needs keep well.
We live all too brief a span.
What little we have should not be wasted.
Well, there's no trace of medicine or fever on these sweet lips.
The surprise of Your Majesty's visit must have cured me.
Wonderful. I shall continue the cure.
Shall I dismiss the chaperones?
- By your leave.
- Yes, by your leave.
Yes, without your leave.
Off. Out. All of you, go.
Companions, brothers.
Lawyer. Go.
Annee, you see before you not the King, but a poor fellow as uncertain, as eager, as hopeful, as afraid as any man that ever fell in love.
I see the King.
Believe me, all kingship on one side.
Women give love to the King like paying taxes.
I wish to be loved for myself.
Well, as you say you're not the King, but only a poor, uncertain, eager, hopeful fellow.
Could you tell me why the King sent an old Church pander to give me my orders?
- Pander?
- The Lord Cardinal Wolsey.
Oh. Did he speak clumsily?
No, Your Grace.
He spoke to the point.
What the King wants, he will have.
No, Annee. It’s quite the reverse.
What you want, you shall have.
- If I have you first.
- Not against your will.
- Not?
- Never.
I’ll earn your love and then your bed.
Tell me what things you want.
Prove me.
There is one thing I want.
I want something that has gone.
You shall have it.
Now walk with me, talk with me.
I love your sweet voice, your company and your bold spirit.
Tell me, dare I ask it?
Is there anything about me that you love?
No.
My God.
You asked not to be treated like the King.
I would have lied to the King.
No one has ever talked to me like that before.
My sweet voice will not lie to you.
But in time, Nan, you'll grow to love me.
Anything is possible.
With us everything is possible.
That's settled. I can return to London.
- You, Cromwell, will remain here.
- Here, My Lord?
To keep me informed.
Tell My Lord of Suffolk that we shall entertain no more such petitions.
Show that to Sir Thomas More, that's his province.
Ah, Thomas.
You smell of horse sweat.
His Majesty has sent me to inform you,
My Lord, that the...
...entertainment at Hever suits him well, and he intends to remain.
Excellent. No, tell Lovell his request is denied.
That witch has been leading him a dance for two weeks.
She'll go the way of all the rest.
Granted.
The King should be attending to matters of State, not pursuing a reluctant girl.
If he wants her, he should take her.
What is Sir Thomas More's opinion about that?
Master Cromwell, when you counsel the King tell him what he ought to do, but never what he is able to do.
If he knew his real strength, it would be hard for any man to rule him.
- He ought to leave Hever.
- Let sleeping kings lie, Thomas, and we'll see to the government of the country.
Nan, it's a cruel thing to be near a woman day after day, to touch her when you wanted to, to have her company when you asked it and to have no response.
To burn with love as I do for you and be denied any pleasure in your cool company.
It is a cruel thing, Nan, to be denied love.
The same cruel thing has happened to me.
I’ve fallen in love.
- Nan!
- But not with you.
My God. I got it right in the face that time. Percy, is it?
You know.
You had Wolsey send him away.
- That blundering...
- I mean to marry him.
- Never!
- But not as my sister is married.
He won't be a complacent husband and I shall not be accessible to you.
All wives are accessible.
Any husband can be placated.
Then you have nothing to fear.
Let me marry him.
No! I want you all to myself!
Nan. Nan.
If you give yourself to me this whole kingdom will turn around you.
Whatever you wanted for anyone. knighthoods, revenues, you shall dispose of them exactly as you please.
And be thrown out in the end? What great revenues does my sister dispose of?
Well, Mary asked for nothing.
I won't bargain. Ask for what you want.
My freedom. To marry whom I love.
Never.
I’ve heard what your courtiers say and I’ve seen what you are.
You're spoiled and vengeful and bloody.
Your poetry is sour and your music is worse.
You make love as you eat, with a good deal of noise and no subtlety.
This is not safe.
Yes, I’ve been told it's not safe for any of us to say no to our King.
That put on, kindly, hail-fellow-well-met of yours.
My father's house will be pulled down, and Northumberland's too, they tell me.
Well, pull them down, Your Majesty, you are what I said.
There is no better way to make an end than to raise anger in me.
I thank you for that. You made a fool of me! And I’m well out of it!
Your Grace!
- You will not harm Harry Percy?
- I’ll try not.
Vengeful and bloody as I am,
I’ll try not!
[grunts]
- Where are you from?
- Northumberland.
- I’ve a message for the Lady Annee.
- You better rest. Give me the letter.
- Give it to no one but the Lady Annee.
- All right.
Harry Percy is married.
"Annee, my love, forgive me".
- The King did this.
- Not the King, Wolsey.
See here.
''I would have held out. But for your safety, dearest Annee, I had to marry.''
That would be Wolsey's threat, that you would suffer if Percy remained defiant.
God, I can't believe it.
The pain is so great, I want to die.
Pain goes, my child.
Few of us marry where our hearts lie.
[shouting, cheering]
Damn all entertainment and damn all women!
Why must I want the one woman who doesn't want me?
I’ll see her!
Elizabeth.
For God's sake make her hurry. When the
King is hungry he's in an evil temper.
I’ll see to this.
Will. Let's see what the lady Elizabeth has decided.
- He's never returned to a woman.
- Lucky for all of us and your child.
- Henry was generous with his children.
- Learn from me, Nan.
Lock up your heart, never surrender completely.
I shall not surrender myself at all.
The moment you're conquered he'll walk away.
That's enough!
I hate him only a little less than I hate Wolsey.
- Ready? Are we ready?
- Quite ready, Father.
* Farewell, farewell
My pleasure past
* Welcome my present pain
* Welcome the torment In my heart
* To see my love again
* Alone, alone
I longed for her
* While mistresses forsaking
* Now must I tell my hopes and fear
* Of love In her awaking *
Bravo, Your Majesty! Bravo!
Bravo, Majesty.
No other king can write as you do,
Your Majesty.
That cheers me, Elizabeth.
Someone, I forget whom, said once that my music was sour and my poetry worse.
That caused me great anguish. True verse and music grow from suffering.
I heard it in my mind when I woke from a troubled sleep.
I wrote it down without a correction.
It sings what is truly in my heart.
If some young man wrote this song for you, Annee, what would you say of it?
I would ask him how his wife liked it,
Your Grace.
You shall dance to my tune, mistress.
The Basse dance I composed.
Play. Be merry. Dance.
Annee, why do you taunt me?
Percy is married, Your Majesty.
- None of my doing.
- I see.
Wolsey is King of England, is he?
That's enough. I am the King.
If you dare to treat me like a bawling boy in front of my court,
- I’ll tear this castle down.
- Do so.
Annee, even a king cAnneot choose where he will love.
I want no one in this kingdom but you.
That's why I’ve returned.
You are not free to love, you have a wife.
If a man is married, king or commoner, he is not free.
I never married Catherine.
England married Spain.
My father coupled my brother Arthur with Catherine for the Spanish Alliance.
Arthur died and I became heir, so it was decided that I, in my turn, should...
...marry my dead brother's widow.
I was 17 and she 23.
So England and Spain married, not Henry and Catherine.
There's a...
There's a curse on that marriage.
All my sons were born dead.
For 20 years I’ve had dead sons.
Now she's past the age of bearing children.
What has this barren marriage to do with you and me?
You cAnneot touch my heart.
You cAnneot bribe me with favours.
The only love I will give you is the love of a loyal subject for her king.
Very well then.
As your King,
I command you to return with me to the court.
I command you to be lady-in-waiting to my wife,
Catherine the Queen.
You will be in my presence every day of your life.
Then we shall see.
- Was he shouting for me?
- Bellowing.
- How they all tremble when he bellows.
- And you?
Does that tremble?
No. But you so hated coming here you spoke wildly.
- I fear you might provoke his anger.
- That was six months ago.
I’m still young. I love dancing and new clothes and gifts.
- And power.
Power is as exciting as love,
I discover.
And who has more of it than the King?
The warship will be launched from Portsmouth in five days time, Your Grace.
Here is the warrant.
But a name is needed for the vessel.
The "Annee Boleyn".
- The ambassadors from Spain?
- Deal with them yourself.
She almost reigns. She entirely rules.
And I believe gives... nothing for it.
- She could prove powerful.
- Thomas, this is a man's world.
The seat of power does not lie between a woman's legs.
Wolsey, Nan reminds me that her father's patent of the Earl of Wiltshire
- has not yet been drawn.
- Indeed. It should be done at once.
Good. Good.
I must tell you, My Lord, a game we ladies-in-waiting play.
A game of titles.
Who has the most titles in the land?
I said that, of course, His Majesty.
But another said, "No, no".
"The great Cardinal Wolsey has more than the King".
"He is Bishop of Tournai, of Lincoln, of
Bath and Wells, Durham and Winchester".
"He is also Archbishop of York and Papal Legate in England, which puts him above the Archbishop of Canterbury".
"Who knows?
He may one day be Pope".
"So he is the most powerful churchman".
"He is also Lord Chancellor and therefore the most powerful layman".
I said, "How fortunate for His Majesty that the good Cardinal is devoted only to the King and to England".
"Consider how dangerous it would be if so powerful a man had ambitions of his own".
His Sovereign,
I confess your royal favours showered on me are more than I deserve.
I can render nothing but my thanks, my prayers and my unending loyalty.
And what livings would you shed to prove your loyalty, my good Vicar of Hell?
Any, or all, sir, at your command.
And your wealth, My Lord?
I believe he is richer even than you.
- So many livings, so many palaces.
- I wonder.
Such vanities mean little to me if I may serve you.
Choose anything I have and it is yours, Majesty.
I will. I will.
When I have given it some thought.
Thank you. Thank you, Annee.
My Lord, you are as generous as you are great.
I shall ask the King to show me your palace at Hampton Court.
Bull's-eye.
Come, girl, play something cheerful.
Men prefer women who laugh and are gay.
Well, what more do you want?
- Nothing.
- For yourself, your family and friends?
- Nothing.
- Liar!
You have a taste for power. It’s very common. I’ve seen it many times.
You don't get it for nothing.
You have to pay.
You ordered me to court.
The power is yours, not mine.
I’m mad for you. I dream of you at night. I long for you by day.
And you dare tell me that I have the power?
I’m no good with any other woman.
I think of nothing but you, of you and me playing dog and bitch, horse and mare, of you and me in every way.
I want to fill you up night after night.
I want to fill you up with sons.
Bastards. They would be bastards.
One word more and I’ll strike you.
One word more.
Without marriage, if you and I have sons, they will be bastards.
Annee.
Forgive me. Forgive me, Annee.
- Who is it?
- Norfolk, with a message from the King.
The devil take him.
Bess.
- Bess, be gone. Come on.
- Out you go, out you go.
- What?
For form's sake.
- Come on, come on.
Enter.
Well?
The King commands that you come at once to the Palace at Greenwich.
Does he, My Lord?
Is he ill?
Is there some urgent danger?
A boat is waiting.
Norfolk!
Is the tide with or against us?
I leave such details to the boatman and other riffraff, My Lord.
You may go.
Enter.
What keeps you half the night from getting here?
Your Grace, pardon me.
Tide is flooding.
Tell the Lady Annee the law of England,
My Holy Lord Chancellor.
Is it not true that I can make legitimate whomsoever I choose?
- Most certainly.
- The documents can be drawn at once?
- Within the hour.
- So?
Could any child of the King's body be made legitimate?
Yes.
And such a child would be heir to the throne of England?
- Most certainly.
- Thank you. Thank you, Thomas.
- Take the flooding tide and go home.
- Wait.
Madam?
Surely such a child would be heir to the throne after the Princess Mary, daughter of the King and his rightful Queen?
- Well, My Lord?
- That might be argued.
No. Let us have it clearly.
Princess Mary is first in line against any son His Majesty may father out of wedlock.
After Mary comes the Duke of Richmond, his bastard by Bessie Blount.
Can you deny that he would inherit if she died?
Richmond? Oh, he's a sickly fellow.
I doubt if he'll live out the year.
Then my sister's child by the King.
We're affectionate, Mary and I, and forgive each other little things, but if she would rather her son sat on the throne than mine,
I would rather mine than hers.
And so mine, you must agree, would be fourth in the lists.
Who knows, madam, you may not be capable of a son.
I’ll give the man that marries me a houseful of lusty sons.
Marriage.
If I were free of Catherine...
You cAnneot be free of Catherine.
- If I were...
- It is impossible.
For the last time, if I were free of Catherine and made you the Queen of England, would you marry me?
Yes.
If you make me Queen of England,
I’ll marry you...
...and give you sons.
Meanwhile...
I’ll go alone to my bed, with Your Gracious leave.
- Brilliant, Your Grace. Brilliant.
- You think so?
Yes. Keep promising her marriage and the siege will soon be over.
- In a month you'll have breached her.
- You think I was lying?
If wooing, praise, gifts and power have failed then you must try a new strategy.
When I go down on my hunkers and pray, good Cardinal, as I do day in, day out, there's only one thing I pray.
Show me how to save England from chaos when I’m dead.
That prayer has just been answered.
I shall remarry and have a son.
- Divorce? Catherine?
- Anneulment.
My marriage is cursed and my sons born dead because I’ve transgressed God's Law in marrying my brother's wife.
It was incest and I’ve been punished.
I was never married in the eyes of God.
Indeed you were, My Lord.
Thoroughly married.
The Pope granted you a dispensation to marry Catherine when Arthur died.
Because England and Spain needed one another.
Because your brother was 15 and had not consummated the marriage.
At 15, I was rogering maids right, left and centre.
At the time I believed, and the Pope believed, and my father chose to believe that Catherine was virgin.
I was deceived.
The marriage was consummated.
Prepare the evidence.
Get me a case for Anneulment.
My Lord, I beg you, as your faithful servant, I beg you to consider.
Catherine is a princess of Spain.
Try to Anneul your marriage and you'll gather enormous forces against you.
Spain, Naples, Germany, the Netherlands.
All of them ruled by Catherine's nephew.
The Roman Catholic Church.
- Your own people who love the Queen.
- I will marry Annee!
It could mean war.
It could mean the loss of your kingdom.
I will marry Annee if it breaks the Earth in two and flings the two halves into the void!
No. I don't believe it of him.
I fear it is true, madam.
As Spanish Ambassador, it is my duty to have... many sources of information.
Then it is Wolsey, not the King.
That butcher's cur, Wolsey, who put it in his mind.
Wolsey is preparing the case to take to Rome.
Enter.
The King is here.
He wishes to see Your Majesty.
I will do all in my power to aid you.
I will send word today to your nephew.
- Yes and to His Holiness.
- This Pope bends to the wind.
Your hope lies in your nephew.
- Your Majesty.
- My Lord Ambassador.
It delights my heart to see you privately after so many months, My Lord.
Sit, Kate. Sit.
Kate,
I’ll come bluntly to the point.
God tells me that our marriage is a sin.
My conscience is deeply troubled.
Incest will be punished and we have been punished with dead sons.
Our daughter, Mary, is alive and well, Henry.
Our marriage must be Anneulled.
Then it is true.
Wolsey has brought you to this.
Kate.
- Kate, it's God's will.
- My conscience is clear.
Help me, for both our sakes.
Support me in my case to the Pope.
But I’m your wife.
Do you believe I can ask Pope Clement to tell the world that my father lied?
My mother lied?
Ferdinand and Isabella, the most christian princes, that each of them lied that my marriage to your brother was never consummated?
Your own father signed the paper with them.
God knows he lied like a Trojan, in season and out.
I’ve had little happiness in my life.
I was a lonely girl, brought from Spain at 15 to be used for English politics.
When Arthur died I was pushed aside and kept here for seven years until I could be used for you.
And you, I loved.
With you I had my only happiness.
I love you still.
Then do as I ask!
No. I will not betray our daughter.
Our daughter is a threat, not a blessing.
I must...
I must have a son!
Get one then, from one of your women!
I’m your wife and your Queen.
And neither your nor the Pope can make my child a bastard!
If you defy me,
I’ll have you sent from the court.
You shall be shut away in the country.
It’s you then, and not Wolsey, who really wants this thing.
I will have it!
I too gave evidence that my marriage to Arthur was never consummated.
Did I lie to the Pope all those years ago?
Did I lie to God?
Did I lie to you?
No.
I will live and I will die your wife.
And your Queen.
As soon as I reach Rome, I shall send dispatches back via Holland.
See that messengers are there.
Not long.
Not long to wait now, Nan.
I shall believe it on the day it happens.
Your Grace.
Yes?
The Spanish Emperor has captured the Vatican.
- Captured the Vatican?
- Rome is sacked.
The dead in their hundreds lie unburied in the streets.
- And the Pope?
- Is besieged.
What...?
By your gracious permission, in private.
[courtiers gasp and mutter]
Well?
The Pope had fled from the Vatican to the town of Orvieto.
- We exchanged letters.
- Yes and the Anneulment?
- He refuses to Anneul your marriage.
- He cAnneot!
- He cAnneot do anything else.
- What's his reason?
The Spanish Emperor's got him by the nose.
The Pope won't offend that Emperor by Anneulling his aunt's marriage to you.
Poor Henry.
He shall, by God Almighty.
I say he shall!
And to hell with the Spanish Emperor.
- Sir Thomas.
- My Lord Bishop.
Shall you in your conscience accept the Anneulment if the decision is for the King?
The Pope has answered the King's appeal and has sent Cardinal Campeggio to try this case.
Campeggio speaks for His Holiness.
I will accept that.
I shall speak against it while I have breath.
I shall be silent until I am forced to speak.
Well, I’m an old man and have no family.
At my age a good death is better than a bad conscience.
Well, you will be the mother and father and I shall be the uncle of a queen next week.
- God be praised.
- I wonder what Annee is thinking.
Out there are my bishops, my courtiers and my loyal subjects.
Campeggio is not your subject.
But I am, Your Majesty.
And I promise you the verdict.
You shall see, Annee.
Wolsey has never failed me yet.
Pray silence for His Grace, the Lord Cardinal of York.
Our commission from Rome having been publicly read, this inquiry will now proceed.
Henry, King of England, come into court.
Here, my lords.
Catherine, Queen of England, come into court.
On. On.
What can I do if the Queen will not appear?
- My Lord Cardinal.
- Ecco.
The King may now proceed.
My Lords, I have come to this court not because I wish to discard a wife, but because such grave doubts are cast upon my marriage and such grave fears invest my conscience.
I do not wish to marry another woman for carnal pleasure, or nor for any displeasure of the Queen's person or age.
This court has been convened to try the validity of that marriage.
The bishops assembled here have signed this document declaring that the marriage is in doubt and must be resolved by trial.
That is the truth, if it please Your Highness.
No, Sir, that is not the truth.
- I do not give my consent.
- Wolsey.
Your memory is failing with age, Bishop.
We argued and in the end you agreed that I should sign for you and affix your seal.
My Lord, there is nothing more untrue.
I told you I would never support this cause.
- Well, well, you're only one man.
Continue.
Hear the witnesses who spoke with my brother the morning after he left the bedchamber.
Are we to have no evidence but bedroom sniggering and gossip?
Get a message to the Queen.
She should be here.
She'll let her case go by default.
I will hear the Queen.
I will only be heard in Rome.
I appeal to Rome.
I appeal against all judges here.
To Rome and to God I commit my cause.
Catherine.
Catherine!
Proceed.
- I am going to adjourn.
- No, I beseech you, do not.
I adjourn this court.
- You have the power. Use it.
- Power to hear the case, Your Majesty.
- But you've heard it, hours of it.
- From Your Majesty's witnesses.
The Queen says no court in England can be impartial.
She appeals directly to Rome.
But you are Rome come to England,
My Lord.
My hands are tied. The trial is adjourned for the Queen's appeal.
To the Pope who fears the Queen's nephew more than he loves the justice of God.
- Your Grace could be excommunicated!
- Get out!
Limp back to Rome.
Tell His Holiness I will have the marriage Anneulled. Get out, get out.
Get out!
Well, My Lord Cardinal, so much for your boastful promises.
Your Grace, forgive me.
Forgive me.
Go to the Queen.
Banish her from the court and house her at your own expense in some remote place.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Wolsey.
Remove yourself from my sight.
You're unfit for office.
Render up the Great Seal.
And hide, Wolsey.
Hide from my anger.
Go now. Go.
Wolsey.
I do not forgive you.
I spare you for your past services.
The business of the day is over, lawyer.
- I am a lawyer who has read the law.
- So?
There is a law of this land that says it is treason to acknowledge any higher authority than the will of the King.
It is, I take it, the will of the King that he shall divorce the Queen and marry the Lady Annee?
It is.
Then the Church in England must grant your will.
It is treasonable to say that the Pope is a higher authority than the King...
...under the law.
I’ve always been a defender of the faith and of the Church.
As matters stand, you are but half the King.
To say that Rome may dictate this matter is to say that Rome may dictate the succession to the Crown.
What the King of England wants, he should have without hindrance from abroad.
True. It is true.
It would mean excommunication.
It would mean a break with Rome.
It would need only the appointment of a new Primate of the Church in England.
He would grant the divorce.
Yes. And the penalty for those good men who could not stomach your law?
The penalty for treason has always been death, Your Grace.
You may go.
There is something else, Your Majesty.
Cardinal Wolsey, through skilful manipulation, has seen to it that the monasteries of England are richer than the goldmines of the New World.
If, as you should be, you become Head of the Church, those riches are yours.
You're a man without scruple, lawyer.
Entirely without scruple.
I learned my trade under
Cardinal Wolsey, Your Grace.
Are you also a pupil of the Cardinal?
No, no, I studied under a real master, my father.
Whatever villainy was lacking in the world when Henry VII was born, he invented before he left it.
But the one cardinal principle he taught me was, always keep the Church on your side.
Well, you have the Church on one side and you have me on the other.
Yes. The choice is now clear.
If I make myself Head of the Church in England, I make you my Queen,
I make myself wealthier than all the monarchs in Europe and I shall be excommunicated.
Everlasting damnation.
No child of the Church shall speak with me, feed me, shelter me.
And when dead, my body shall lie without burial and my soul...
...shall be cast into hell forever.
Heavenly Father, what I seek is not for myself as You know, but for the future safety of my realm and the greater glory of Your name.
If I weaken in my resolve, remember I am but a man.
Give me Your heavenly strength for my intended journey and resolve my doubts.
My Lords,
I intend to bring before Parliament matters which have concerned us greatly.
I am deeply alarmed by the increasing influence and power in our State of the Church of Rome.
Not content alone with misappropriation of property and money,
Rome now seeks to interfere with the laws and statutes of this realm.
In particular, the King's prerogatives related to the succession to the throne.
For all these reasons and many others known to you all we must free ourselves from the interference, influence and direction of the See of Rome.
Hear, hear!
Item. The Oath of Allegiance to the King of England sworn by you all.
Item. The Oath of Allegiance to the Pope of Rome sworn by the Clergy.
Question. Whom do the Clergy serve?
Pope or King?
Cardinal Wolsey, the greatest Churchman of our land is cast down.
Any bishop or priest who does not first serve the King will follow him.
Parliament will be summoned for the enactment of this bill named The Act of Supremacy.
The King is declared to be supreme in matters of the welfare of subjects, both spiritual and temporal.
- Sire...
- My Lord Bishop, keep silent!
There is only one question
I will put to this Council.
No other will be tolerated or discussed.
Does any Lord here, either spiritual or temporal, deny the right of Parliament to make this the law of the land if Parliament so chooses?
Sir Thomas More?
I do not deny the right of Parliament to enact laws.
Good. Good.
- Master Cromwell.
- My Lord Chancellor?
I regret, Master Cromwell, that you did not heed my advice.
Concerning what?
You have, I believe, told the King not what he ought to do, but what he can do.
Now no man in the world can hold him.
The King's power must be complete.
And your own?
To serve his.
After today, I fear I must resign mine.
Every man to the devil his own way.
Forgive me, Your Majesty,
I had meant to be gone.
I fear I cAnneot rise.
Cromwell, your hand.
Get me on my feet.
It’s the habit of a lifetime to see myself that the inventory is complete and the keys are all ready, all labelled for you.
I’m...
I’m sorry to see you ill.
Oh, no, My Lord.
Your Majesty has taken from my shoulders a load that would sink a navy.
Well, I’ll leave these and be gone.
Is it... Is it for you, Mistress Annee, the palace?
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.
It’s much too beautiful for an old man.
It needs youth in it.
There, take it.
I’ve been your enemy, but I can't take it from you.
Then I’ll leave it.
A leggy girl and a half-grown steer.
What does that mean?
Some friends of yours are waiting to see you, Your Majesty.
More, Fisher and Prior Houghton.
It seemed urgent.
Urgent for them.
Send them in.
I’ll tell them as I leave.
Well, the country air will do him good at Esher.
The King will see you.
Take heed, Sir Thomas.
The King's passion for the lady is blind to all reason and past service.
My Lord, for your wisdom,
I am sorry to see you go.
The King has gone beyond me.
Through that one woman,
I am lost forever.
Do not neglect the King, but see to your own safety.
It happens that I have been unwell lately.
Therefore I have given up my office and shall leave the court and go home.
There I will speak of nothing but... domestic affairs.
Well, God be with you.
It is Pope or King, there is no other choice.
For me it must be the Pope.
I must follow my conscience.
I cAnneot sign.
Though I am sorry to lose old friends, you will die for it.
There are hundreds of my Order who in good conscience cAnneot take this oath.
Must they all die?
If they insist, they will.
My cause is just.
The English Church cut off from Rome is without an anchor.
The only anchor I know is the King.
The King had to choose, so must the Clergy.
Well, Sir Thomas?
I have come to say goodbye, Your Grace.
I gave up my chain of office today as you kindly permitted.
And when that day comes when you have to choose, will you sign the oath?
I shall read the document with care and hope that my conscience will permit me to sign, Your Grace.
Goodbye... Thomas.
Goodbye, My Lord.
Goodbye, Prior John.
You leave this world of your own will... and I am sad for it.
Your Majesty, it will go on without us.
And that is the last of them who dare question.
The rest will die silent.
I think there has never been a king who gave so much to find his way to the heart of the woman he loved.
I have stabbed, fought and clawed my way through tissues of the Church and State.
I’ve looted and plundered. I’ve ripped and torn the bodies of my friends.
And all to come to this day.
And yet, not once...
Not once have you said, "I love you".
Now, my Nan...
My Nan will say it now.
Yes.
I do love you.
No.
No, that's not it.
That's not what I meant.
- What more do you want, My Lord?
- I don't know.
I don't know, but I still don't have you.
Tell me, Nan, did someone some day say to you, never give in to him, never melt to him, never forget to hate him for a time, otherwise you'll lose him?
- I’ve said it to myself.
- And do you say so still?
- Yes.
- I see.
I see.
Keep your heart, then!
Preserve your special chastity.
I’m too old to suffer the longings, passions and frenzy of a stupid boy!
Writing poems in the night to the cold-hearted bitch that I love and tearing them up.
Pacing up and down in my room, unable to sleep.
Sons you have promised me when you are Queen, and sons I will have.
Sons without love if I must.
Enjoy your palace.
I will not come near you again until the marriage day.
Henry!
I do love you.
Henry, I love you. I love you with all my heart. I love you.
- Can this be true?
- I love you.
Take me, take me now.
I want to be yours only.
I’ve been yours for a long time.
Now, you for the first time are mine too.
Henry.
These men who were to die, let them live.
- It was done for you.
- I no longer care about the divorce.
I’m so in love with you, my darling heart.
Can it be true after this long time?
God in heaven, I do love you with my whole heart.
And our love will make a son that will rule the world.
Our son.
A son. A son.
With that and your love I’d be the King I’ve always wanted to be, wise, generous, just, merciful.
So I’ll kill no man for you.
It’s like a new age.
Wildfire in the air and in the blood.
Harry!
The King sent for me to meet him here.
Here?
Perhaps he is jealous and testing my faithfulness by bringing us together.
Perhaps.
- Has he reason to be jealous?
- No. Never
Well, well. You're his concubine,
I have a hag for a wife.
Now I am to arrest Wolsey who began it all. Cold comfort.
- Arrest him? He's old and sick.
- I thought it was your doing.
No. I’m past hating him.
- Give him the warrant.
- Your Grace.
Well, there's your first love.
The one you hated me for.
- Did your heart race?
- No, you great royal fool.
- I’m a happy man.
- And I, My Great King,
I’m with child.
Annee.
Nan. Nan!
Where is she? What keeps her?
The Lady...
- Begin. Begin.
- Yes.
Your Grace, the door must be open, that is to say, for legality.
- Witnesses are required.
- Here they are. On, man, on, on.
It’s a new fashion. Marry the one before you divorce the other.
Henry, wilt thou take Annee, here present, to thy lawful wife
- according to the rites of the Church?
- I will.
Annee, wilt thou take Henry, here present, to thy lawful husband according to the rites of our Holy Mother Church?
I will.
- ''I, Henry, take thee, Annee.''
- I, Henry, take thee, Annee...
- ''To my wedded wife.''
- To my wedded wife.
''To my wedded wife, to have and to...''
To my wedded wife, to have and to hold, for better, for worse,
- in sickness and in health...
- ''Till death us do part.'' and thereto I plight thee my troth.
And after that, Nan, you shall have bells and the crowning.
Stand back. Stand back.
- Out of the way.
- Stand back. Stand back!
Here, Nan, for luck.
The flowers of May.
How much were they paid to cheer?
A groat each.
A thousand between here and Westminster.
They should've got a silver penny.
They'd have thrown caps in the air.
God save Queen Catherine!
We've been outbid by the Spanish Ambassador.
Whore! King's whore!
Long live the Queen!
- There's an honest fellow.
- Which queen does he mean, My Lord?
- Whore!
- Long live the true Queen!
Whore!
Long live Queen Catherine! Whore!
Heralds, play!
- Long live Queen Catherine!
- Whore!
Out! Out!
The King would speak with his Queen.
Out!
Come here.
It’s a long time since I’ve kissed a queen.
Nan, I’ve kept every part of the bargain.
Will you be happy now?
My Queen, my woman, my...
- Whore, the crowd said.
- Damn the Spanish Ambassador!
You must outbid him at the christening.
In four months when I give you a son
I want cheers of joy.
They wont need bribes.
It'll be the happiest day in the history of this kingdom.
Would you rape a pregnant woman?
Oh, Nan. God, forgive me.
You great royal fool!
Whoa there, boy.
Go and get her!
- Your pardon, madam, the Queen calls.
- Is it born? A boy?
It is nearly time, the midwife says.
Fetch the King.
I’ve waited 20 years for this.
I shall teach him to ride, wrestle, draw a bow.
It makes a man young again to have a son.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Here comes my good news.
The child is born!
The child is perfectly formed and in good health, Your Majesty.
I have failed.
I have failed.
God help me
Give me privacy.
Don't weep. Pinch your cheeks and give them colour. Sit up and smile.
Your are the Queen. Brazen it out.
A girl this time, but a boy the next time. Do you hear me?
- Is she beautiful?
- Yes, she is.
Give me the child.
Give me my daughter.
Is he well? Is he strong?
My Lord...
Those are lungs that will out-bellow the Spanish Ambassador. Ey, Nan?
And the eyes. The eyes are clever.
We'll call him Edward.
It’s a lucky name for English Kings.
I have borne you a daughter,
Your Majesty.
- A daughter?
- Yes.
Why did no one tell me before I entered?
I wanted to tell you myself, Hal.
We have a beautiful daughter.
Next time, a son.
Elizabeth.
We shall call her Elizabeth.
- Is the child in good health?
- Perfect, Your Majesty.
Good.
Well, if we can have a healthy daughter, we can have a healthy son, as you say, as you... say.
I’ll kiss you and leave you, Annee.
God bless all here.
Will you not kiss your daughter?
My daughter?
No. When she's older.
When she has a brother.
- Still no word from the King?
- No, Your Majesty.
- No answer even to my letter?
- Nothing, Your Majesty.
How can he so utterly forget so much?
He does not forget, Mother.
He just has no wish to remember.
But rumours say that all is not well with them.
Still no sign of a son.
That woman is in despair, they say.
For already my beloved father's eye has started to wander again.
Poor Hal.
Poor Hal.
- You pity him?
- Was I not his much-loved wife?
And you are his daughter.
Unless he has a son of a true marriage, you are his heir.
You must be Queen.
And remember, when I’m gone, you're first.
Doctor! Quickly!
Touch her and I’ll have her sent from court.
Who?
That half-witted Seymour who is always so tongue-tied and blushing and adoring
- when you enter my chamber.
- She's a child.
- But you would get a child by her.
- But not by you, except a useless girl.
Mind your tongue or I’ll have you sent from court to cool your temper, madam.
Play on! Play!
The Queen is tired, but does not wish to spoil your pleasure.
Play!
Jane.
I...
I think we shall dance well together.
If I lead strongly, will you softly follow?
I hope so, Your Grace.
That little sheep won't hold the royal bull beyond the first encounter.
I order you!
Leave us.
Where is Jane Seymour?
Cromwell tells me when the dance was ended, she was sent away under guard.
She's on her way to Northumberland.
As far away as I could send her, since we don't own Scotland.
She has the face of a simpering sheep, and the mAnneers. But not the morals.
I don't want her near me.
- You will bring her back!
- I think not!
If you want her near you, find a place for her in your palace at Whitehall.
Whilst I am here,
Jane Seymour must lie elsewhere.
Tell her.
Your Majesty, the people say that you are the witch Queen.
Are we ruled by superstition?
Catherine still lives in the heart of the people.
The people say that her daughter is the heir and yours the bastard.
I do not fear the people.
The people hate you, madam, for displacing Queen Catherine and tearing the King away from the true Church.
As they hate me for despoiling the monasteries.
But the King, they truly love.
You and I, madam, live in the protection of the King.
So?
So in Parliament, which speaks for the people, there is a bill.
It is called the Act of Succession.
It makes your daughter the heir and Catherine's daughter, Mary, illegitimate.
If the King does not wish it, the
Act of Succession will not be passed.
Would you sacrifice the child of our love to get a silly little harlot brought back to court?
One daughter is much like another.
I care not who's named bastard when I’m dead.
If I bring Jane Seymour back you will have Parliament pass the Act of Succession?
Yes.
What a liar you are.
What good is that Act unless every man in the kingdom who has power to accept my child as legitimate heir first swears an oath of fealty to you as Head of the Church?
And if they do not, Act of Succession or no Act of Succession, they will say my child is the bastard and there's an end!
Go.
Nan, if you love me, don't defy me.
Bring her back.
I love you.
I shall go to my grave loving you, no doubt, and hating you.
I will bring her back to my court if the oath is sworn by all men of power, high and low.
But those who refuse must die.
- You once said they must not die.
- You once said they must.
And now so say I.
Annee.
Annee.
If you love me, forget the succession.
If you remember how it all came about, how can you look me in my eyes and say our daughter will not succeed?
Because it would need unlimited murder.
Nan, look at me.
Is it fitting I should be Head of the Church, Pope and King at once, a farce so that so many men must die?
Could you sign the death warrants?
I’d sign 10,000 rather than disinherit my blood!
It’s that, or else it's my blood and Elizabeth's.
Cromwell knows that.
Your butcher cleaver man knows that.
Send him to implement these details, and let it be done quickly.
High or low, they will sign.
I wish I were loved, but I’m not.
And yet I am Queen of this island and Elizabeth also shall be Queen.
For Elizabeth, no.
For her I will not commit murder.
Annee, if we had a male heir, your son and mine...
I can be angrier than you've seen me.
I know where your heart is, not with me.
What has love got to do with begetting of a king?
I’m not young. I’m not true.
I’m bitter. I’m envious.
I’m dangerous. I’m malicious!
It’s your misfortune that you love me now that I no longer love you.
And yet, at this moment I want you because of the anger in your face
- and the spark of blood in your cheek.
- No.
Annee, give me a prince and everything would be forgotten.
No! Not unless you kill them,
More and Houghton and Fisher and all who will not sign, not unless Elizabeth is your heir!
I’ll kill them, then.
I rob, murder and commit sacrilege... at your command.
You do what you wish and call the deed mine.
I hate you.
I hate your desire and mine!
I pray you, Master Kingston, see me safe up.
As for my coming down, let me shift for myself.
Good people, it has...
The King's orders.
You must not be heard.
Well, then I will not speak.
I die the King's good servant, but God's first.
No!
No! No!
- Well?
- A boy born dead.
She has miscarried of her saviour.
I am accursed!
A live daughter and a dead son!
Did I accept excommunication for this?
Did I send More, Houghton and Fisher to their death for this?
She cAnneot give me a living son!
Very well, then.
If she cAnneot give me a male heir,
I shall rid myself of her.
Sir, with Catherine's death,
Annee is too firmly the Queen.
Find a way. Find a legal way.
I will divorce Annee.
Divorce is like killing. After the first time, it doesn't seem difficult.
Your Grace, we asserted English law.
Annee is now Queen by English law.
Indeed. Indeed.
I divorced Catherine in good faith.
But since that time, I have discovered an impediment to my marriage to Annee.
I had a child by her sister Mary.
That, too, is incestuous.
We used the incest excuse last time.
We can't make a habit of it.
Neither Pope nor Emperor will uphold her and the people hate her.
She'd fight. Her sister was married. You couldn't prove it wasn't her husband's.
- Who do you serve?
- The King, Sir.
Your Grace can't afford to start all that again.
Then do you know another way?
No, you! You tied me to her!
Now you find a way to get rid of her!
Perhaps...
...in her own life.
Her life?
Yes.
Her marriage contract with Percy.
He had her.
That's it, you crawling toad.
No, Your Grace, not her past life, the present.
- The rumours that she has a lover.
- Annee? A lover?
I, a cuckold?
- Why, you're mad.
- If I could prove it?
Invent it, you mean, with false evidence.
Adultery is high treason.
The penalty is death.
Get out.
Cromwell.
It’s most kind of you to come, Master Smeaton.
I am honoured.
When invited to supper,
I’m expected to sing for it.
- As you do for the Queen?
- Oh, that is my pleasure.
She wishes me to be the first music teacher to the Princess.
Please, sit.
No other guests.
Thank you.
Yes, for the Queen to make the Princess your pupil, she must think most highly of you.
Ah, the advantages of music.
I did not know that music interested you.
It doesn't.
I am interested in the Queen, and you know her so well.
Why, I’m merely a servant.
I have the King's express orders to protect the Queen's person.
We have learned of threats.
Oh, many hate her.
I am dining you, as I will dine others, to get to know those whom I may trust.
Oh, I see, I see.
And it is true that she likes to have you close to her, is it not?
Without boasting,
I believe she prefers me to many.
She prefers my style to the Italian.
It is nearer to the mAnneer she loved in the French Court.
She learned to love like a French woman.
Yes, simple tunes sung with...
You would be wiser not to laugh.
It is a more valuable asset than a pleasant singing voice.
I make my way by singing. I’ve no desire to go any further by any other route.
Come now.
There are only two reasons for you to be constantly in the Queen's apartments.
You love her, or you are in the pay of Spain.
- Why, I go when I am sent for.
- To love or spy? Which?
I’m sorry...
Which?
You're too simple to spy,
I know that.
- So it is love. You love her.
- No! No!
You do not love your Queen?
Well, yes, all right, I do love her.
As my Queen.
- And she loves you.
- No, Sir, of course not.
Barton, come out here.
Bring your papers.
The last reply, but one.
''Well, yes, all right, I do love her.''
- What are you trying to make me say?
- The truth.
- That you are the Queen's lover.
- Oh, no.
No! No!
- You first slept with her in February.
- I never!
- On the 18th of February.
- No!
Surely you remember such an important date?
- No!
- Come, try to remember.
No! No! No!
- Try!
- Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Anyone can walk, but can you walk with a train?
- Yes.
- All right, head up.
Go on. Good!
Don't look round. Go on.
It will follow you like a kitten's tail.
Oh, what a queen it will make some day.
- Enter.
- Madam, the Duke of Norfolk insists...
Uncle! This is a rare honour nowadays.
Leave us.
Nan, brace yourself, girl.
I have a warrant for your arrest.
For my arrest?
A poor joke.
It’s not a joke, Annee.
I could've let others do it, but I felt I could do it more gently.
But I’m the Queen.
How could I be arrested? For what?
Adultery, it says here.
Nonsense no doubt, but there it is.
Adultery? With whom?
- Smeaton, Norris and others.
- I thought you were serious.
- I am.
I am to take you to the Tower.
There's to be a trial. I am to preside.
But I’m the Queen.
My child, she's the King's heir.
Leave her with your women.
Annee, you must come at once.
Elizabeth!
Annee.
Down? Master Kingston, shall I be shut in a dungeon?
No, madam. You will be lodged near the room where you lay on the night before your coronation.
Oh, Jesus, have mercy on me.
I am Lady Kingston, madam.
I will wait upon you.
Will you?
Then go away. Leave me!
I fear, madam, that she must stay.
Every word spoken to you or by you must be reported.
Send them away, Norfolk!
- Leave us.
- But...
Leave us!
Shall I ever be allowed to walk out and look at the sky?
Shall I ever be free?
Norris, Weston, his friends?
His friends since I first met him?
- And they are accused with me?
- Yes.
He is willing to kill them to get rid of me?
- To kill his closest friends?
- [man] Come on! The other way!
My brother.
Why have they arrested him?
He also is accused of being your lover.
Incest.
Oh, God help me. The King is mad.
I am doomed.
Your Highness, you are accused of high treason in that you, being the lawfully wedded wife of our Lord the King, did commit adultery.
I ask that you answer my questions.
By what lawful authority am I called here?
I am your Queen. And, as such, share the
King's immunity from arrest and trial.
Norris, Weston, Smeaton and Brereton were tried and condemned ten days ago.
If they are guilty, then you are guilty.
- Did they plead guilty?
- They were found guilty.
They were innocent as I am innocent!
Any man, no matter who he is, who says the contrary is a liar!
My Lord, the warrant of treason was issued by direction of the King.
That is sufficient to give jurisdiction, however, so that there may be no possibility of doubt as to her guilt,
- will My Lord call the first witness?
- Call the Earl of Rochford.
George Boleyn, Earl of Rochford, come into court.
The Earl of Rochford.
Read the indictment.
George Boleyn, you are accused of high treason, in that on certain days and dates, here specified, you did commit adultery with Annee, Queen of England.
Being your own sister in the flesh, an act of incest.
No! Not true!
It is not your turn to speak.
How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?
You are a foul liar, and my judges are your creatures.
Stand up, Thomas Boleyn,
Earl of Wiltshire. Come to the bar.
Do you recognize these two here accused, known as Annee and George Boleyn, as issue of your body?
- I do.
- Look at them, My Lord.
By the same mother, Elizabeth Howard, daughter of the late Duke of Norfolk, and therefore full brother and sister in the flesh so that their lying together would be incest?
- Yes.
- For which the penalty is death.
Proper evidence will be introduced later. Remove the prisoner.
That's all, My Lord.
As father of the accused, you are excused your duty as a judge and may leave.
Present your next witness.
- Mark Smeaton, come into court.
- Mark Smeaton.
My Lords, this man was tried as a commoner.
He confessed and was found guilty of adultery with the Queen by a jury of his own order.
He will give evidence against the Queen.
Put your questions.
Smeaton, did you have carnal relations with the Queen?
Smeaton, did you lie with the Queen?
No.
There is mercy only for those that tell the truth.
Three men have been found guilty on your evidence. Was that perjury?
You confessed to your guilt knowing the penalty, knowing, unless the King is merciful, you will be hanged, cut down while you still live, disemboweled and your heart torn out!
The King will not be merciful if you lie!
- Did you have carnal relations?
- Yes!
My Lord of Norfolk, may I question this man?
I have not finished.
Justice must be seen to be done,
Master Cromwell.
- Proceed.
- Thank you, My Lord.
Mark, look at me.
I know well you have been tortured, but tell them the truth, Mark.
Have courage.
- It is true.
- Write that. He says it is true.
They have promised you your life, haven't they? If you lie for them?
They will break the promise.
It would not be safe to leave you alive.
- It’s true.
- He says it is true for a third time.
- We have our evidence.
- Poor gentle singer.
Isn't it better, if you are to die, that you die with the truth?
I am guilty!
I was guilty with the Queen!
Let me go now.
She came to my bed...
Let me go.
She came to my bed, I swear it.
Even when she tells him he will die anyway, he still admits his guilt.
Write that. Take him out.
No. Wait.
My husband, the King.
Smeaton...
...how many times did the Queen come to your bed?
- Many times.
- When?
- I don't remember.
- You will remember.
Call it to mind or you'll speak with those who can jog your memory.
Where did you couch with the Queen, my wife?
- York Place.
- That's a lie.
- It could never have happened there.
- No, no, it was at Windsor.
She only went to Windsor with me.
Can you think of no better lie?
It was many places, it was wherever you like, whenever you like.
Oh, God, help me. Let me go free.
I’ll say whatever you like.
Did Cromwell promise you your life if you said this?
- Answer me! Did he?
- Yes.
He lied. Say what you like, Smeaton, and you will not live.
Say what you like.
Speak now without lying, for it will avail you nothing.
I am to die?
What happened between you and the Queen?
Between us?
Nothing.
She was kind and pleasant and just.
I would not hurt her.
I lied because they have broken me with ropes and irons and then promised I would go free.
Take him away.
And yet...
...it could be true.
For six years...
This year and this...
...and this...
...and this...
...I did not love him.
And then I did.
Then I was his.
I can count the days I was his in hundreds.
The days we bedded.
Married.
Were happy.
Bore Elizabeth.
Hated.
Lusted.
Bore a dead child...
...which condemned me...
...to death.
In all...
...one thousand days.
Just a thousand.
Strange.
And of those thousand, one, when we were both in love, only one, when our loves met and overlapped and were both mine and his.
And when I no longer hated him, he began to hate me.
Except for that one day.
I’m not hungry.
Take the food and leave me.
Nan, is it true?
Have you stepped into your own trap,
My Lord?
Any evidence you have against me, you yourself bought and paid for.
- Do you now begin to believe it?
- Annee.
Annee, the court is still in session to decide your... verdict.
I don't want to hear your guilt from them, I want to hear it from your lips.
- That I was unfaithful?
- Yes, just that.
Were you unfaithful to me whilst I still loved you?
Of course, I’ll never know. Whether you say aye or no, I shall never know.
You come here to make sure whether there was truly adultery because that would touch your manhood or your pride and even so, my heart and my eyes are glad of you.
Fool of all women that I am,
I’m glad of you here.
Go, then.
Keep your pride of manhood, you know about me now.
Nan, is it true that you're glad to see me?
- Yes, it's true.
- Then, Annee, let's do all gently for old time's sake.
I have no wish to harm you, and your words have moved me deeply.
I must be free to have a son, and the son must be free to rule England when I die.
Why must you leave a king to follow you?
Why not a queen?
This country has never been ruled by a queen. It never could be.
We can never have a son now,
God has spoken.
I must have a son elsewhere.
And it's getting late.
I’m not as young as I was.
What do you want of me?
Agree to Anneul the marriage and give up all rights.
You shall go abroad and take Elizabeth with you. You will be well cared for.
Please set me free.
To marry Seymour and make our child a bastard?
No. No. No.
Nan... Nan, you leave me no choice!
Once I told you any children we had would not be bastards.
You promised marriage and the Crown.
Now you try to dance out of your promise. Well, I won't have it!
We are man and wife together.
King and Queen. I keep that.
Take it from me as best you can.
Then you have decided, and so have I!
Before you go, perhaps you should hear one thing.
I lied to you.
I said ''I love you'', but I lied.
I was untrue. Untrue with many.
- That is a lie.
- It is true.
I was unfaithful to you with all of them.
With half your court! With soldiers of your guard, grooms, stable hands.
Look, for the rest of your life, at every man that ever knew me and wonder if I didn't find him a better man than you!
You whore!
But Elizabeth was yours.
Watch her as she grows.
She's yours. She's a Tudor.
Get yourself a son on that sweet pale girl if you can and hope that it will live.
But Elizabeth shall reign after you.
Yes! Elizabeth, child of Annee the whore and Henry the bloodstained lecher, shall be Queen.
You've asked for death and you shall have it.
So be it.
Only what I take to my grave, you take to yours.
And think of this, Henry.
Elizabeth shall be a greater queen than any king of yours.
She shall rule a greater England than you could ever have built.
Yes! My Elizabeth shall be Queen.
And my blood will have been well spent.
She's lying.
She was never unfaithful to me.
She could. Any woman could.
No. She lies.
If she lies, let her die for lying.
Let her die!
- Is everything ready?
- Yes, My Lord. The Queen is at prayer.
Fetch her.
The time for prayer is passed.
- And where is the King?
- At Richmond. Out hunting.
Will you join him later?
No, by God.
For me there's killing enough this day.
[executioner speaks French]
Will it hurt?
They say not, My Lady.
The executioner from France is an expert with the sword.
I hear that he is good.
And I have a little neck.
- Oh, My Lady.
- No, Kingston. No.
Come, I am glad to die.
The month is May.
- My Lady?
- Nothing.
Mon Dleu! She looks at me!
Distract her!
- Away, My Lords.
- Where to, Your Grace?
To Mistress Seymour's.
Elizabeth shall be a greater queen than any king of yours.
She shall rule a greater England than you could ever have built.
My Elizabeth shall be Queen.
And my blood will have been well spent.
Vtg
The Nile was always there.
Long before Cairo, long before the tombs of kings... it was the reason for everything.
It's a little hard to grasp how far this river's been flowing.
This is the rain that fell on Abyssinia.
These are the waters drained from central African lakes... that have flowed 4,000 miles to make Egypt green.
The Nile has its memories.
The story of Khartoum is a recent one... less than a century old.
That's yesterday in this part of the world.
But however far back you may go... all the Nile's recollections have several things in common.
There's always God, for instance.
Or, if you prefer, the gods.
It seems to have been quite impossible... to live beside this river... and not to have visions of eternity.
And there's always mystery.
You never quite know.
You wind up with a few questions that no one can answer.
One more thing.
Why is it that everything was always so big... outsized, larger-than-life?
Vanity? Perhaps.
Or visions.
Vanity was always mixed up with vision.
And that's part of this story, too.
But it's the Nile that remains the original fact.
The Nile and, of course, the desert.
Move up, up the Nile.
Leave Egypt behind and the green land.
Enter the Sudan.
A million square miles of desert and scrub.
It was here out of the vast, hot African nowhere... that a man of the Nile, a man of vision... and mystery and vanity rose up in the 1880s... to challenge first Egypt, and then the world.
He called himself the Mahdi, the Expected One... and he gathered about him his desert tribesmen... and he cried out for holy war.
Egypt hired an army of 10,000 men... and a professional English soldier to command them... and sent them 1,600 miles up the Nile to Khartoum... and on into the desert to destroy this man, the Mahdi.
Our history might have taken a quite different turn... had Colonel William Hicks not forgotten, if he ever knew... the Sudan's great fact... its immensity.
The Mahdi led him on and on... and on.
- Keep those men back!
- Right you are! Keep order!
Back!
Bugler!
Deploy!
Get those rifles to the high ground!
Mahdi!
Beloveds, you're men of the desert.
My Lord Mohammed, blessings and peace be upon him... commands me to speak... for I am the Mahdi, the Expected One... and I am sprung from the forehead of the family... of my Lord Mohammed, blessings be upon him.
My beloveds, did I not promise thee... a miracle would fall from heaven from the Prophet Mohammed?
And was not this so?
We fight a holy war against the fat and the corrupt... and the sinful and the unbelieving.
We fight a war to restore to a disobedient, forgetful world... the laws and commands of the Prophet Mohammed... blessings and peace be upon him... whose instrument on Earth I am.
Exalt ye not that men are dead, since more must die tomorrow.
My beloveds, in a vision... the Prophet Mohammed has instructed me.
Let mountain and desert tremble.
Let cities shudder, and let the fat and the rich... and the corrupt in far places mark this moment... and turn in fear of all those miracles to come!
And let none in all Islam, from this victorious hour... believe I am other than the Expected One... the true Mahdi.
Beloveds, it is the hour of prayer.
Explain to me, somebody, where in heaven's name is Wolseley?
Explain to me how a rabble of tribesmen... armed only with spears and swords... can destroy a modern army?
Not a British army,
Prime Minister.
- To the last man.
- An Egyptian army.
I don't care whose army.
10,000 men... a British officer commanding.
Why did Egypt have to hire an Englishman?
Colonel Hicks was a fool.
Clearly. A fool.
That's not the question.
Why did he have to be English?
"Avenge Hicks."
"Uphold Britain's Honor."
Wolseley, I have the press at my throat.
I was summoned to Scotland to explain to Her Majesty.
Will you explain to me...
Mr. Gladstone,
Colonel Stewart... recently attached to military intelligence.
The colonel's just back from Khartoum.
He will be able to explain better than I.
Colonel Stewart, sit down.
Are these bulletins from Khartoum true?
It's over a month's travel from the Sudan, sir... so, obviously, I left before these events took place... but I assume they're true.
Why?
I was sent to Khartoum to assess the Egyptian capacity... to deal with the uprising.
I assessed it as nil.
Military intelligence?
There's intelligence for you.
After the event, they knew all about it.
My reports were delivered to Sir Evelyn Baring... in Cairo before the event.
I was aware of the reports.
I just didn't believe them.
- I'm Granville.
- My Lord.
The reports still don't explain to me, however... how a modern army could be slaughtered... virtually to the last man.
Colonel Hicks and his men, sir, were fighting for wages.
The Mahdi and his men were fighting a holy war.
Also, Hicks made a very bad mistake.
He thought he was fighting an ignorant savage, and he wasn't.
The Mahdi is the most extraordinary man... the Sudan's ever seen.
And he knows his people.
He promised them a miracle.
He had to deliver it.
Even so, Colonel Stewart, the extent of the disaster...
The disaster, sir, has little to do with the loss of 10,000 men.
It's their arms.
Egypt was unequal to a horde of desert tribesmen... when they'd scarcely a pistol to call their own.
What does he do now... now that they've captured
10,000 Remington rifles... five batteries of artillery... and very nearly five million rounds of ammunition?
And I must add what will become of Egypt... if the Mahdi occupies Khartoum and the Khartoum arsenal?
What a jolly day you'll have with Her Majesty tomorrow.
Gentlemen, let me make one thing clear.
I'm sending no armies up the Nile.
You, Hartington, your imperialist friends... you're looking for any excuse to move into central Africa.
We are discussing Egypt.
We have a moral responsibility to Egypt.
A moral responsibility.
We have the Suez Canal.
Say it.
Egypt protects Suez.
We protect Egypt.
Why in heaven's name can't Egypt protect herself?
We've just heard from Colonel Stewart.
She's not up to it.
Colonel Stewart?
I've no doubt he's like the rest of you.
He can see himself leading a British army...
1,600 miles up the Nile, flags flying, glory for all.
I beg your pardon, sir.
Before I'd accept such a command...
I'd resign my commission.
I wouldn't spend one British life... to oppose the Mahdi, not in the Sudan.
I assumed you were for intervention.
You didn't ask my opinion, sir.
Well, I want it, by heaven, if it agrees with mine.
Gentlemen, I shall suggest... to Her Majesty in Scotland tomorrow... that we shall discharge our obligations to Egypt... by evacuating all the Egyptians from Khartoum.
How, without either a British army... or loss of British honor?
I shall entertain suggestions as to just how.
Gordon.
Chinese Gordon.
What's Gordon doing now?
He's made a contract with the king of the Belgians... to take over the Congo from Mr. Stanley.
We can arrange that with Brussels.
Send Gordon to Khartoum.
The man who led the Chinese Emperor's armies... to victory after victory carrying only a cane... send him to Khartoum.
- Without an army?
- Gordon doesn't need an army.
Yes, remember, without a single British soldier... he ended slavery in the Sudan.
He's a hero... to the Sudanese... to the English, to the anti-slavery people... to the churchmen.
Send him to Khartoum, and you'll be applauded... from Land's End to Inverness... and Her Majesty.
Granville, you're wasting my time.
The man's a mystic.
He's an idealist... with ideals strictly his own.
Give him an instruction, he treats a military order... as if it were a birthday greeting.
Besides, I trust no man who consults God... before he consults me.
May I speak, sir?
In my opinion,
General Gordon would refuse.
After all, when he went to the Sudan... as Governor General and put down the slave trade... with nothing but his own audacity... and a few loyal lieutenants... sir, he didn't face the Mahdi.
He didn't face a holy war... and he didn't face
10,000 Remington rifles.
If you send him to Khartoum on his own now... he'll simply fail.
What a pity.
Sir, if General Gordon accepted your proposal... and the conditions of today, my respect for him would end.
He'd be the vainest man alive.
Thank you, Colonel Stewart.
Now, would you leave us to our deliberations?
My congratulations on the excellence of your report.
Good day, sir.
I like that man.
Did I understand you correctly?
If we send Gordon to Khartoum...
Gordon, a national hero... and he fails... then the blame will fall on him, not on the government?
It could happen that way.
It's the most abominable proposal...
I have ever entertained.
Granville, the colonel had a point.
Just why would Gordon do it?
Because he's a patriot and a man of conscience... or perhaps the vainest man alive.
I dislike everything about this.
Worse, I distrust it.
I know nothing about this conversation.
But let me know in Balmoral what Gordon says.
Her Majesty would be so pleased.
Apologize for the secrecy,
Gordon.
Politics.
Let's not waste time with formalities.
Sit down, please.
I can't keep the train for Scotland waiting forever... or there'd be curiosity.
We need few words.
Granville will see you tomorrow... with a proposal so disreputable... that I can have nothing to do with it publicly.
Privately,
I ask you to accept it.
Why?
Because it will provide me with political comfort.
I can conceive of no commodity, sir... that could interest me less.
I'm not a free agent, you know.
I leave for the Belgian Congo within weeks.
Granville could arrange that.
Gordon, the Sudan was your child.
I don't need to inform you it's in the gravest danger.
You don't need to inform me.
Gordon, I cannot and will not... send military forces up the Nile... but I admit Khartoum cannot be left to its fate... without some gesture.
Am I the gesture?
The whole country knows your capacities.
You've done before alone what an army of blunderers can't do.
What's the proposal?
That you go to the Sudan... supervise the evacuation of Khartoum... do what you can to leave peace and order behind.
- With what powers?
- None.
Egypt will give you some ribbon or other.
Politicians.
And when the Mahdi floats me down the Nile... the government will assume a pained expression... and say to Her Majesty and the churchmen... and the anti-slavery people,
"We sent Gordon.
"We did the best we could."
Precisely.
That'll be the end of Gordon, but not of Gladstone.
In a nutshell.
I must say, Mr. Gladstone, you're hardly a bore.
You don't bore me either,
Gordon.
You're illogical and insubordinate.
I know if I send you to Khartoum... you'll play tricks, you'll exceed your orders... and in the name of some mystical necessity... apparent only to yourself... you'll do your ingenious best to involve this government... up to the hatband.
But you're in a very poor patch... and you have no one to turn to but me.
Again, in a nutshell.
I'll take a chance on your tricks. That's all I can say.
I'll see Sir Evelyn Baring in Cairo... brings pressure on the Khedive... to appoint you Governor General of the Sudan... but I cannot and will not back you up.
This must be understood.
No British troops will come up the Nile.
I will not assume a British obligation to police the world.
If you can help the Sudan, your country will be grateful.
If you can't...
My country will understand.
I'll go.
You'll come back safe.
Gordon, first, last, and above all... you'll come back safe.
Do you hear me?
I hear you.
You'll need an aide.
I have a good man in mind.
Isn't such a choice my prerogative?
Not in this case.
He'll be useful to you.
And to you.
Naturally.
Well, Gordon...
God go with you, and I don't envy God.
Put my luggage aboard, please.
Very good, sir.
Yes?
Your second-in-command, sir,
Colonel J.D.H. Stewart.
So.
This is for you, General.
You'll find my report in here.
It'll bring you up to date.
Am I to understand that Gladstone has cursed me... not only with a spy, but with a subordinate... who thinks he knows more than I do?
I was brought here in chains, sir.
I don't know what to think.
Brandy and soda, sir.
B & S? It sounds as though you'll need one.
- Thank you, sir.
- Right. Sit down.
You are Gladstone's spy, aren't you?
Yes, sir.
Would it be indiscreet of your commanding officer... to inquire as to your instructions?
Not at all, sir.
I am to report to Mr. Gladstone... any actions you may take which, in my opinion... conflict with your instructions.
I am to inform you and the government if necessary... of any situation which, in my opinion... places you in physical danger.
And if anybody in the course of this mission... must risk his life, then I'm to do it, not you.
Apart from that, sir,
I'm yours to command.
Tell me what, in your opinion,
Colonel Stewart... are the chances of my sacking you?
If they existed, sir...
I'd be the first to point them out to you.
Drink your brandy.
Thank you.
We seem to have sailed.
Farewell, England.
So you and I are definitely stuck with each other.
Yes, sir.
For heaven's sake, man, sit down.
May I ask a question?
If it's impertinent,
I withdraw it.
Why did you let them talk you into this mission?
As is well known, I regard myself as a religious man... yet, I belong to no church.
I'm an able soldier, but I abhor armies.
I could even add that I've been introduced... to hundreds of women, yet I've never married.
In other words, no one's ever talked me into anything.
Does that answer your question?
No, sir.
Then let me suggest that my life is not an open book... to you, to any man, least of all to myself.
With your permission, General,
I think I need a turn on deck.
Send a telegram as soon as we reach Calais.
Sir Evelyn Baring, Cairo.
Locate immediately whereabouts Zobeir Pasha.
Signed, Gordon.
That's spelt Z-O-B-E-l-R.
Yes, sir.
I expected outrageous nonsense from you, Gordon.
I expected the worst, but Zobeir Pasha.
Even the Khedive was appalled.
I see nothing outrageous,
Sir Evelyn.
Zobeir's a Sudanese.
He used to be the most important man down there.
He's able, wise, still has a powerful influence.
You'd like to take Zobeir with you to Khartoum... to give him control over the Sudan.
Gordon, the man is a slave trader.
Was a slave trader.
My instructions are to evacuate Khartoum... and leave some sort of order behind.
How?
Well, most of the chiefs...
Ioyal to the Mahdi today used to be loyal to Zobeir.
I think they'd come back to him.
Sir Evelyn, I cannot go to Khartoum without a plan.
- I insist on seeing Zobeir.
- Why would he see you?
You not only put him out of the slave trade... you killed his son in the process.
I must take the chance.
One must always take chances.
Why is Towfik making us wait?
Well, Sir Evelyn, it's been my experience... that when you're giving orders to sovereign princes... you have to expect a little humiliation.
It makes them feel better.
Humbly, Highness,
I accept this command... as Governor General of the Sudan... and I swear to you my devoted service.
Do you understand,
Gordon Pasha... that your wages will only be £6,000 a year?
It is all I can afford.
I'll take 2,000.
It's all I need.
What about a B & S?
Sir.
God be with us.
Zobeir Pasha, you are well?
General Gordon goes to Khartoum... as Governor General for the Khedive.
He pays you his compliments, and he would speak with you.
This is my aide,
Colonel Stewart.
We come from London, Zobeir.
My government is determined to lend Egypt no support... in the face of the uprising and to prevail on the Khedive... to relinquish control over the Sudan.
Sir Evelyn will confirm what I say.
This is unwise.
There will be ruin... and death, and tears, and little else.
It is my government's policy.
I have no authority beyond evacuating... all Egyptians from Khartoum.
I could wish otherwise.
But you have the power and the influence... and the ability to oppose the Mahdi.
Will you come with me to Khartoum... and accept the Sudan from my hands?
Do I receive this offer... from the British government,
Sir Evelyn?
No, my government renounces all influence over Sudanese affairs.
This is a matter between you and General Gordon.
If I give you my word that there will be no slavery...
I regard the institution as ended... does my attitude influence your government?
I understand.
My reputation.
But what would your Christian world say... if the slaver Zobeir received ten million Sudanese... from the hands of the great Gordon Pasha?
My government would oppose you... publicly.
I would defend you.
Publicly.
The general will defend me.
The great Christian hero will defend Zobeir the slaver.
Before I receive my country from your bloody hands...
I shall see it die.
You killed my son.
I executed him.
Do you have sons, Gordon Pasha?
Do you have sons?
No.
You killed mine.
God forgive me, Zobeir.
But let the dead bury their dead.
You killed my flesh!
My blood!
My suleman.
Get thee from my house, and may ye die in the desert untended.
May vultures consume thy flesh, sands thy blood.
Go back. Go back to London.
There's too much danger, too little hope.
I'll report my news to Gladstone.
I'll stand by you.
Thank you.
You said you had to have a plan.
What can you do now?
Get up the Nile to Khartoum.
Stewart, just how far into the Sudan would you say we are?
We'll reach Berber in an hour or so.
In your report you said that the Mahdi's people... wore jibbers covered with patches.
That's correct, sir.
And his main force is still beyond Khartoum?
Yes, sir.
Look there.
We haven't even reached Berber.
Gordon Pasha!
Ali lbrahim!
Gordon Pasha!
No, Ali. No!
Sheikh Ali lbrahim of the Manasir.
My friend before God.
Ali, please.
I weep for joy.
We are saved! We are delivered!
- Delivered?
- Berber is surrounded.
I am cut off from my people, except by the river.
To the east, to the south, to the north.
Mohammed al Khalia, the villain, he has gone over to the Mahdi... taking all the tribes along this shore.
We saw a band downriver.
Did they get their guns from the Mahdi?
Since the terrible disaster of Hicks Pasha... it seems all have guns.
But you return, and we are saved.
- We are delivered.
- How? I bring no army.
You will find a way,
Gordon Pasha.
You have always found a way.
My friends, we must drink coffee and speak of the old days.
Sir, I've prepared a telegram for London.
I request that you read it.
I have an official responsibility... to advise you to turn back to Cairo.
The situation has changed.
Situations always change.
Sir, Berber is surrounded.
The uprising spread this far while we traveled.
You could be caught in a trap.
Give me a camel,
I can get out of anything.
You're a responsible spy.
Send your telegram.
You're bringing these people nothing but false hopes... and false expectations.
There are still 13,000 Egyptians to be got out of Khartoum.
If the government had known that by now... there'd be armed Mahdis tribes on both sides of the Nile...
400 miles north of Khartoum...
They wouldn't have sent me.
Then you cannot proceed further.
If Her Majesty's government... at this moment wants to run out publicly... on the Egyptians, send your telegram.
Get them to recall me.
But you have to make the decision. They won't.
I've made my decision,
Colonel Stewart.
But what is your decision?
General, when you left London, your only hope was Zobeir.
So, if you have any further plan... beyond vague self-confidence, you haven't confided it to me.
Was I instructed to confide in you?
I don't recall.
Are you willing to delude the Sudanese... gull the Egyptians, and compromise your country... just to satisfy your own vanity?
Next time I'll shoot you.
I've shot men before.
Now send your telegram.
The boat is coming!
Look at that!
Isn't that marvelous?
How exciting!
Everyone in Khartoum must be on the coast.
Gordon Pasha!
Welcome back, Gordon Pasha.
Thank you.
It's good to be home again.
You can't see anything from down there.
Gordon Pasha will be with us shortly.
Sheikh Abdul Rahim.
Gordon Pasha will be with us shortly.
Mr. Frank Power, Her Majesty's counsel in Khartoum.
Also the "Times" correspondent.
Where is he?
Gordon Pasha will be with us shortly.
Monsieur Herbin,
French counsel.
Gordon Pasha will be with us shortly.
- Khaleel, B & S.
- Yes, master.
B & S.
Thank you.
Now, master, it has been a very long time.
So you cannot expect me to remember all things... without confusion.
For if you had left me this Bible... then it would be different.
I could not have read it, but even so...
- Khaleel.
- I'm here, master.
Khaleel, there's something
I want you to do for me.
And I shall do it, master.
Now, this great Jesus Christ, sometime, master...
I do not understand this man.
For He announced, and He was very clear about it... for once He was very clear... almost like the great Lord Mohammed... bless him and peace be upon him.
But I do not understand this Jesus Christ.
For as I remember, you told me,
He announced most clearly... as I have said...
Khaleel, there's something
I want you to do.
You have only to speak master.
Now, He say when a man is struck upon one cheek... he must turn the other.
Do you? No.
You don't.
I must inform you, Khaleel, as delicately as possible... that I am not Jesus Christ.
Wait! Will you first find out for me... where the Mahdi's camp is at present?
Khaleel.
Peace be with you.
Peace be with you.
Send a messenger to Mohammed Ahmed... who is called the Mahdi... and tell him that Gordon Pasha...
Governor General of the Sudan, has entered his camp.
It is a lie before God!
He is not Gordon Pasha!
Abdullah! Gordon Pasha is here!
How does he appear?
The skin is pink.
The beard is only here.
It is gray.
Khartoum.
Holy person, we saw him yesterday in Khartoum.
It is Gordon Pasha.
How many are his soldiers?
He is alone with one black slave.
I fear it. He makes magic.
We saw it yesterday in the streets.
Kill him.
You're all so innocent.
Who makes the magic that brings him... to my camp alone with one black slave?
He... or I?
Bring the great one to me.
Is it because you are an infidel, Gordon Pasha... that I feel myself in the presence of evil?
I doubt it, Mohammed Ahmed, for you are not an infidel... and I smell evil.
I have 30,000 soldiers in my camp.
Is it because you are so brave... or so foolish, that you come here alone... unarmed, with only a black slave to hold your robe?
Khaleel is not a slave.
He is a free man.
He comes with me out of love.
And he does not hold my robe, but a gift for you.
Years ago, Mohammed Ahmed...
I led the armies of the Emperor of China... at a time of great trial.
And when his enemies were crushed and confounded... and his throne was again secure, he made me this gift.
I have brought it from London for you.
It is most exquisite.
When the Emperor of China ceases to be a non-believer... and accepts me, the Expected One... as the true Mahdi... then I shall be happy to receive such a gift.
Khaleel?
You will wait just outside.
Abria. Real abria.
I've had none in five years.
Your meeting with Zobeir Pasha was less than happy, I believe.
Your intelligence service... has an excellence beyond my expectations.
How much you must regret having killed his son.
I executed his son.
I have no regrets.
It was a necessary object lesson... in my campaign against the slave trade.
And it was successful.
I brought peace to the Sudan.
But since you have come back now... with instructions to evacuate Khartoum... most happily, the peace of the Sudan... no longer concerns you.
What a pleasure it is to negotiate with a man... who knows even my instructions.
We need waste so little time on preliminaries.
What are your instructions concerning Khartoum?
I have been instructed by the Prophet... blessings and peace be upon him... to worship in the Khartoum mosque.
There are those among the
Sudanese who will oppose you.
I welcome in peace all those who worship with me.
And the others?
Mohammed Ahmed, may I suggest... that when first
I came to the Sudan... its body was sick, stricken with hunger and abused by war.
I cured it... and this land...
I'm not a loving man,
Mohammed Ahmed... but this land became the only thing that I've ever loved.
I cannot, under my God... do you understand?
I cannot leave it to the sickness... and the misery in which I once found it.
I respect you, Gordon Pasha.
I make no war on you.
Make no war on your own people.
I'll take the Egyptians back to Egypt.
I'll leave the Sudan to the Sudanese... and be happy and contented, but if I'm to leave Khartoum... to sickness and misery, to death...
The Egyptians must remain in Khartoum.
I am a poor man of the desert.
But I am the Mahdi, the Expected One.
On my cheek is the mole.
Between my teeth... the space.
And so that all men may know that I am the true Mahdi... the Prophet Mohammed, blessings and peace be upon him... makes miracles.
Do you understand?
I begin to.
Gordon Pasha, do you believe that the Prophet... blessings be upon him, has instructed me... to pray only in the mosque at Khartoum?
No. I am to pray in the mosque at Cairo... and at Mecca, and at Baghdad... and in the mosque at Constantinople.
He has commanded me to make holy war until all of Islam... acknowledges the purity of his biddings... and all the world trembles before me.
But all Islam must know who I am.
And believe.
Gordon Pasha, for tasks of such greatness... great deeds are needed.
Egypt opposes me... and so the Egyptians must remain in Khartoum.
For I shall take it in blood... and the streets will run in blood... and the Nile will taste of blood for a hundred miles... and every Egyptian will die... every child, woman, man.
Sudanese, too, who opposes the will of my Lord Mohammed... will die.
This is how it must be in Khartoum.
Great and terrible thing.
Or I shall not pray in the mosques of Cairo... and Mecca, and Constantinople... nor will the world ever tremble before me.
I had thought in my lifetime that I had witnessed all things.
And you have.
You have described to me how it was an object lesson... when you slaughtered the sons of the slavers... and brought peace to the Sudan.
You have no regrets.
What is the difference,
Gordon Pasha?
An infidel object lesson, or a holy miracle?
If Khartoum is sacrificed... then all Islam will tremble and bow... and in peace I shall proceed... to all the mosques where I must pray... and the lives of millions will be spared.
Whisper to me, Gordon Pasha... if they are different.
This is how it will be.
This is how it will be.
Stewart Pasha.
He's back, sir.
Excellency, he has had no sleep.
General!
You have... been to the Mahdi.
He plans to lay siege to Khartoum... take it by force.
To slaughter all the Egyptians and those Sudanese who haven't accepted him.
But there are 35,000 people in Khartoum.
Those are his purposes, and I believe him.
The man is sincere.
He believes utterly in the divine necessity... for what he's doing.
How could I have been such a stumbling fool?
I'm a man who will question anything... except my own religious convictions.
The Mahdi's no different.
There's vanity for you.
I seem to have suffered from the illusion... that I have a monopoly on God.
It's the failure.
There are so many things
I'm not afraid of... but... to fail...
You haven't failed, sir.
Who else could have found out the Mahdi's intentions?
If I'd known about this in London... would I have recommended against sending an army?
How could any British government survive a massacre like this... without making some attempt to forestall it?
Yes. Get off a telegram to Cairo, immediately.
If the government moves on this, they can...
Sir.
The telegraph's been cut.
- Where?
- Below Metemmah.
- When?
- Today.
Sir, Mohammed al Khalia attacked Berber at dawn.
Your friend
Sheikh Ali lbrahim... escaped downriver at 10:00 this morning... and since then there's been no message.
We presume the city's fallen.
If so, the Nile is closed.
The evacuation.
We must get these people...
Sir, there isn't going to be any evacuation.
If they hold Berber, they've closed the Nile.
Sweet Jesus.
There is no alternative.
Gladstone must send an army.
If they've closed the Nile at Berber... we can get messengers across the desert as far as Debba.
The telegraph must be working there.
Yes. They can't have got that far.
Call your staff together,
Stewart.
We must check the food supplies.
We'll manage till help comes.
I've been an engineer all my days.
If I can't fortify a city with rivers on two sides of it...
I should be broken to the ranks.
- Go on.
- Sir.
Save Gordon.
Prime Minister, how many more of these debates... can we survive?
We must do something.
If Gordon can get messengers out of Khartoum... he can get himself out.
Prime Minister, please.
Who is the government,
Gordon or I?
I've been talking to Wolseley.
He can send a small detachment into the Sudan.
He promises no further than Debba.
I'll make no compromises with this man, Granville.
I've distrusted him always,
I distrust him now.
A small detachment, for communication purposes only.
A gesture.
We are in trouble!
Well, a small detachment.
But I will not turn this government... to overseas adventure.
Not for all the Gordons, the sentimentalists... the plots, the intrigues.
Save Gordon.
Now then, we are here.
You see, here's the city wall right there... with your guns emplaced all along.
And this is the ditch we're digging... connecting the white Nile to the blue Nile.
Now, when it's flooded, the city will become an island... and if the Mahdi crosses the river... and attacks from out here, the ditch will stop any charge.
But you must have your guns emplaced... so that their fields of fire overlap... then if one gun is knocked out... the next will still cover the same field.
- Do you understand?
- I understand, Gordon Pasha.
I sincerely hope so, Major.
Off you go.
I've been wondering, sir.
The Nile's aflood at the moment.
What happens when it falls and our ditch goes dry?
That won't be till next winter.
If they haven't sent an army by then... we'll all be dead of old age.
I don't think the Mahdi's waiting for that.
I just saw them putting up his personal tents over the river.
He's moving up.
Well, I could have the ditch flooded in a few days.
Good. I don't think he'll attack for a while.
He'll try to tighten the siege first, weaken us.
I want you to help me plan a giant-sized raiding party.
I want to take it upcountry between the rivers... and bring back every head of cattle... every measure of wheat for a hundred miles.
It might have to last us quite a while.
Sounds like a dangerous job, so I better do it.
It's in the orders.
Forget the orders.
Finish your ditch.
Flood it when you're ready.
Meanwhile, let me have a little fun.
Stewart Pasha.
Gordon Pasha is ten miles from the city... with a great convoy of grain and cattle.
A spy brings news the Mahdi is attacking him at dawn.
They're out there somewhere.
We'll make a stand and hold them... while you take all the cattle and grain into Khartoum.
If we divide, they'll have to divide.
You take all the cavalry with you... but don't let them turn you.
You must get the convoy into Khartoum.
- Good luck to you.
- Sir!
Hurry!
You, up the pace. Come on!
Now then, we can hold them here while the convoy gets away.
But keep your men low.
Don't give them a target.
Dismount yourselves.
Get your horses down, too.
Let them charge through us.
Once they've passed us, we'll have them against the light.
Well, good luck then.
Be quick.
Re-form!
Re-form and prepare to fire!
They're coming out of the light this time.
Stand fast.
Prepare to fire.
Fire!
Move forward!
Ready... charge!
They'll come at us again from the dark now.
Take cover!
Re-form!
Nearly three hundred dead.
How much of the convoy did we lose?
None. You must have brought in all the loose grain and beef... this side of Abyssinia.
It'll have to last us till relief comes.
This came yesterday via Cairo and Kitchener.
- I've read it.
- Who's Kitchener?
He's a major who's arrived at Debba with an army.
Precisely twenty men.
"You exaggerate the danger, sir.
"Suspicion still exists, sir...
"that you've created a situation...
"to fit your own personal inclinations.
"Leave Khartoum at once, sir.
"This is you last, final, ultimate order."
Obey the order, General.
Go to London. Explain to them.
You'll come back with an army.
I'll come back with an army.
They wouldn't listen to me.
If they did, they wouldn't believe me.
If they believed me, they'd keep me in England... if they had to lock me up in the tower of London.
You're the one to go.
They'd believe you if I stayed here as a hostage.
They'd believe you because they must!
I'll give you Khaleel.
He knows the route through the desert and the wells.
We've enough food here now to hold out for months.
The Nile's too high for the Mahdi to attack.
You must do it.
Yes, sir.
Let's get back.
Kitchener.
I'll take cholera, dysentery, sunstroke, fleas in my bed...
Arabs in my hair, but I cannot take politicians.
I wish you well, by heaven... but I don't envy you what you're up against.
Your man better stay with us until you get back.
Colonel Stewart, sir.
Get out of the way!
Say nothing, sir.
Your carriage is there, sir.
Clear the way, please.
Say nothing.
Sir.
I wasn't prepared for all this excitement.
The prime minister's waiting for you.
I want you to know before you see him... that he missed a vote of censure... in the House of Commons yesterday by only a few votes.
I want you to know also that
I'm on General Gordon's side.
You mean there's hope, sir?
I mean nothing of the sort.
Let's put all that aside.
There's just one thing that matters.
Did Gordon or did he not receive a direct order to return?
He did.
Could Gordon or could he not be standing there in front of me?
He could.
Then, Colonel Stewart... does your presence here confirm or deny...
Gordon's total disobedience?
- It confirms it.
- It's blackmail!
A man... one man... in the middle of Africa... is blackmailing the British government... into a course of action... it wouldn't otherwise choose to take.
I don't agree, sir.
You don't agree?
Is it really blackmail when one man... a long way off in a besieged desert town... calls to you and says...
"Allow these tens of thousands of human beings...
"to be slaughtered, if you will.
"It's your decision.
But allow me the privilege...
"of being slaughtered with them"?
You see, sir, if Khartoum is allowed to die... then Gordon will die with it.
It may be blackmail... and if it is, then I'm for blackmail.
Send in Lord Wolseley.
When I think how history will record someday... that the decisions of an empire were made only... by greedy businessmen, scheming generals... and conniving politicians...
It's up the Nile for you,
Wolseley.
Up the Nile to save one stubborn madman.
But let me tell you, if you do a Billy Hicks on me... if you take a British army into central Africa... and present me with any portion of a disaster... then don't come back.
Am I clear?
You are clear.
Colonel Stewart, inform your General Gordon... that a British army will be sailing... as quickly as possible for Cairo.
Thank you, sir.
Sir.
Khaleel.
Get me Colonel Stewart's man,
Khaleel.
Sir.
We didn't want to come to the palace.
This is informal, but it's serious.
General, people are afraid.
They have a right to be.
What about this relief army?
Why the hysteria?
There's still enough food.
What we're short of isn't food.
It's hope.
Power, you're English.
You know the government... how long they take to make decisions.
You all know how many weeks it is to London... how many weeks back.
It could be another month before we have word.
I'm an old friend, you believe me.
I tell you, in the bazaars,
I hear things.
It isn't good.
What am I supposed to give them, promises I can't keep?
Tell them lies to keep up morale?
Maybe small lies. Just a few.
Little ones?
Khaleel!
Yes, master? Good morning.
It is such a pleasant thing to...
Khaleel, what are you doing here?
Where is Colonel Stewart?
Yes, master, I do not know.
But as I was saying, that little place, Debba... by the river, is the most boring place...
- Khaleel!
- I'm to be home.
Yes, the Major Kitchener sends his greetings.
Most interesting man, the Major Kitchener.
It's Stewart.
He's sailed from England... with Wolseley and 7,000 men!
They're coming!
The British are coming!
I do not have the ingredient here, Gordon Pasha... but if you will come back to the palace...
I will make you a B & S.
Squad, attention!
Stand the camels.
Mount!
You... did you come here on holiday?
You think you've come to Egypt on leave?
Look at those buttons... filthy.
Look at this. Disgraceful.
What would Her Majesty say?
You there, stand up.
I don't say it isn't necessary, sir... but we've been in Egypt for six weeks now... and the Nile is falling.
What I feel I must point out... is that the fall of the Nile in Khartoum... comes two months earlier than here in Cairo.
And that when the Nile has fallen sufficiently...
Khartoum will be defenseless.
Thank you, Colonel Stewart.
But you know as well as I do... that men who have not been fully conditioned... to the tropical climate simply cannot fight.
They'll die... by the platoons, by the company.
I agree, sir, but couldn't you send ahead... a detachment of your best-conditioned men?
No, Stewart.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Don't be too hard on Wolseley.
You haven't seen his instructions yet.
I was there.
He's to relieve Khartoum.
Colonel, I've seen the orders.
He's to bring out Gordon.
There's no mention of Khartoum.
Wolseley knows.
He's to proceed up the Nile as slowly as possible.
He'll move up to Wadi Halfa shortly, yes, but he knows.
He's to give Gordon every chance at the last minute... to come out by his own choice.
But Gordon won't come out.
You know it.
I now know it.
I'm sure that Wolseley knows it.
They've been friends always.
That's why I say... don't be too hard on him.
It's the government that's unconvinced.
I can well understand why you haven't told me this before.
Why do you tell me now?
Because it's on the cards,
Colonel... that this expedition will be too late.
Gordon should come out.
There's no one to tell him but you.
Didn't he say where they're mounting them?
He does not know, Excellency.
He saw the guns arriving, that is all.
You were Gladstone's gesture last year.
This year, it's Wolseley.
Sir, I failed.
I thought
I'd made it clear to them... that you'd never come out.
- I didn't.
- You probably did.
Gladstone's a gambler.
He's gambling.
No, they all think you should come out.
So do I.
Sir... what's the absolute limit of time we can hold out here?
I don't know.
The Mahdi's brought up the guns he captured from Hicks.
That means he'll start a bombardment.
- How low is the ditch?
- It's low.
And the news'll be all over town by morning... the steamer arrived and no army.
There'll be a panic.
Sir, you haven't got a chance.
I haven't got a choice.
If Wolseley's orders are to save only me and not Khartoum...
I'm left with no choice.
How could I leave? Tell me.
What purpose is served if Wolseley's too late... and Mahdi attacks?
There are worse ways to die.
Many.
That's the essence of it,
I suppose.
Every man has a final weapon... his life... and if he's afraid of losing it... he throws that weapon away.
That's what they can't quite grasp... that I'm not really afraid.
And that's what they must understand, isn't it?
No one can make them understand it except me.
You must be tired.
Meet me at the dock tomorrow, early.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
To get her through the blockade, we'll have to armor the rail... set up troop guns here, another one up forward.
We'll carry the extra fuel behind in a couple of luggers.
I want every European in Khartoum on this boat... the wives, children, counsels, too...
Frank Power and Herbin... and every Egyptian civilian you can stack on board.
You must get them all out.
You mean I go with them, and you stay here?
Khartoum is my problem.
Getting these people out is yours.
How else can I convince London that I will not leave?
But you'll be completely alone.
It's a gesture.
Come, little lady.
We'll take you back home.
Mr. Gladstone must understand... that I am capable of gestures, too.
Hassan!
I don't ask you to be unafraid, simply to act unafraid.
How are you going to handle Khartoum... when the word gets around that we're gone?
How are you going to handle Berber... if Mohammed al Khalia has heavy guns?
We sink.
We'll both take our chances.
There are several letters in here... appeals to Her Majesty the Queen, the Pope in Rome... the Sultan in Constantinople.
They're all for public display.
There's only one appeal that matters... Wolseley.
And through Wolseley,
Gladstone.
Perhaps now you can convince him.
Get through.
You'll get through.
Good luck.
Gordon Pasha, we are ready to sail.
Thank you, Hassan.
Why didn't we go, Gordon Pasha?
Why wasn't I on the boat,
Gordon Pasha?
I should've gone on the boat.
This is Metemmah.
We'll refuel.
Beyond here, the shore is held solidly... by Mahdi's tribesmen... so you better go ashore and stretch your legs.
Be your last chance.
Firewood? We have no firewood.
Well, trees.
Trees? Do you see trees?
Yes, a mile or two from the town... and Egyptians hanging from them...
I need fuel.
Tear out the dock!
Come on!
This is all we have left?
This is all we have left.
Excellency, do not blame the superintendent.
Someone presented orders for grain... with your forged signature and seal.
He sold it in the town for profit.
Find him.
He will be executed.
For how long shall we eat?
The garrison will eat for about two weeks.
The town...
Requisition all stocks of grain in the hands of merchants.
There is little, Gordon Pasha.
All privately-owned livestock, donkeys, goats, camels.
We ride beneath no more desert stars, then.
All things must end.
Take him, too.
We reach Berber tomorrow morning.
This is the main point of blockade... so we'll be attacked from both shores.
If we get through... it'll be luck, discipline, and surprise.
Pray for surprise.
And pray also that Mohammed al Khalia... has no heavy guns.
Can't we move any further from the shore than this, Captain?
I'm sorry, Stewart Pasha.
We're already too close to the sand bank.
Full speed.
Number one, fire!
Number two, fire!
Fire at will!
They have no heavy guns.
We'll make it.
They're coming.
Below.
Salaam Malachim.
Malachim Salaam.
The Mahdi and l... we look at each other across the river... we assault each other with assurance.
Mostly the assurance that we're still here.
I'm late. Forgive me.
Where is the army?
For whom do you speak,
Sheikh Osman?
For myself, for the leaders of our people.
We do not come to you,
Gordon Pasha... with cries and wails...
"Why did you not send us down the river...
"beyond the fringe of danger?"
We are not of Egypt.
We are Sudanese.
And this is our country... and this is our people within these walls.
When does the army come?
Good sirs, I can only tell you what I know.
I sent Stewart Pasha downriver to urge all possible haste.
It has been ten days.
He should have reached
Major Kitchener in five or six.
It should not be long.
How long?
The Nile is low, Gordon Pasha.
Bellies grow empty.
Men feed on fear.
You do not have this fear of death yourself, Excellency?
It's a luxury
I've put behind me.
You are exceptional.
Gordon Pasha, when we accepted your protection... for ourselves and for our people... the Mahdi marked our souls for damnation.
We were not afraid.
We trusted you.
Did we choose correctly?
You could not choose otherwise.
It was against your convictions.
We now speak of life and death, not convictions.
Do you propose going over to the Mahdi?
We propose nothing.
We ask, "Where is the army?"
I don't know.
I am wondering, is there an army?
Don't call me a liar!
I beg of you... or I shall have to lock you up.
We are locked up now.
Sheikh Osman... you are Khartoum's most respected citizen.
If you leave, the city's spirit will break.
It will surely fall.
And you will be responsible for its massacre.
I have no choice but to stay.
I repeat... you have us locked in.
- Gordon Pasha...
- Wait!
If you were given the choice, you still could not do this.
You could not leave Khartoum.
When one cannot choose, one can never know.
But you will understand, will you not, Excellency... that there are those among us... more afraid of death than yourself.
We cannot all be exceptional.
Gordon Pasha, the police.
They have the man who stole the grain.
Awaan, is this true?
Tomorrow morning.
Firing squad, take aim!
Fire!
As Governor General of the Sudan...
I issue the following proclamation... at dawn tomorrow... the city gate to the south will be opened.
It will stand open for three hours.
All inhabitants of the city who wish to leave... and seek the protection of Mohammed Ahmed... known as the Mahdi... will be free to do so.
No hindrance will be placed in their way.
I can't believe it.
When did you say the others passed through?
A month ago.
An armed steamer called the Abbas... passed through Metemmah downstream a month ago... and is since unreported.
General Gordon had placed all of Khartoum's Europeans... aboard the steamer... with instructions to run the blockade.
Colonel Stewart was in command.
Stewart!
Are you quite sure that
General Gordon wasn't on board?
General Gordon remained in Khartoum.
Sir, the Nile is falling.
What he's done is to make a public announcement, sir... that cannot be misunderstood.
He'll never leave.
Gentlemen... if you please.
We move instantly on Khartoum.
Only the camel corps is ready.
You, Sir Herbert, will take command.
I will stay here with the main force... moving up as soon as possible.
But you will go ahead by water to Debba... make a formation there... and then take the desert crossing to Metemmah... there to embark for Khartoum.
Kitchener knows the route and the wells.
Move, gentlemen.
Stand your camels.
Mount!
Advance in a column of sections from the right.
Walk!
Did you pack the powder tightly?
Yes, Gordon Pasha.
All right, then.
No, not too much sand on the fuse, men.
Give it plenty of air to burn.
Now, you see, by firing this pistol into the tinderbox... we can set off as many fuses as we have running into them.
Like this.
Come along.
- Call your men in.
- Right. Over here.
Quickly.
Good. Should be able to set off about twenty fuses... from each tinderbox.
I'll want at least 400 pots.
The whole approach to the city must be mined.
Yes, Gordon Pasha.
Halt!
Form battle square.
Take up action stations.
Down!
By now the Christian soldiers are on the river.
- Attack, beloved one.
- Attack now, holy person.
There is no more time.
It is the moment.
Beloved one, give me the word.
Do I make my preparations?
Send me the one who writes English words.
- Wonderful!
- Gentlemen, what is this?
Excellency!
From Major Kitchener, a message at last!
British soldiers have crossed the desert at Metemmah.
They approach Khartoum on the river!
And Stewart Pasha?
He's safe, Excellency.
Their bus was delayed, but it is safe.
But the messenger says, so you'll know the news is true...
"Stewart Pasha still has the ring you gave him."
Give the man money, something to eat.
The messenger from the Major Kitchener... eats and says thank you.
He's very brave.
I said to the messenger,
"Is it true that...
"the Major Kitchener has big dark eyes...
"like flies in the night?"
And he say it's true... that his eyes are like black daggers... and before them, all men tremble.
The Major Kitchener has eyes as blue as little flowers.
The man was bragging.
He'd never seen Kitchener.
He didn't want to say so.
That's true, master.
If he was lying... how could he know about that ring I gave Stewart Pasha?
Anyway, if the Mahdi wanted to send me a false message... why would he say the soldiers were coming?
It makes no sense, Khaleel.
That is right, master.
Tell Abdullah he may make his preparations.
Then he must come to me.
Where did you get this?
The Mahdi asks you to come to his tent in peace.
A faluka awaits you at the ivory trader's dock.
I am his first Khalifa Abdullah, and I remain here.
I am your hostage.
You will not regard it as a discourtesy, I hope... if I lock you in.
If I'm not back by dawn, you'll be shot.
Welcome, Gordon Pasha.
Come in peace.
How did this come to you?
It came to you with the greetings of your friend... far down the river,
Sheikh Ali lbrahim... of the Manasir people.
Sheikh Ali lbrahim has been induced... by my friend and great emir
Mohammed al Khalia... to acknowledge me as the Expected One... the true Mahdi.
He sends you assurance... that should you care to proceed down the Nile... he will offer you safe passage.
You are my guest.
Why do you invite me here now?
Because the Prophet Mohammed, blessings be upon him... has appeared to me in a vision... and instructed me to attack
Khartoum with fire and sword.
20,000 angels will proceed my men into battle.
And terror will afflict and subdue my enemies... as far as Mecca and Baghdad and Constantinople... for all will know what a truly great miracle... has been done by my Lord Mohammed.
I should prefer, Gordon Pasha, that you leave Khartoum now.
You are not my enemy.
Why should your blood sweeten the Nile?
What you are saying is this... so long as I am in Khartoum you dread to attack... for a British army is close, and you know it well.
A British army.
The message.
I sent the message.
There is no British army.
Your soldiers are in Egypt.
They play cards, drink the liquor, pursue women.
Why would you send me a false message?
It is sometimes wise,
Gordon Pasha... to provide a man with a few sunny hours... of fraudulent hope so that when night comes... he will have a more perfect inward vision... of the truth of his hopelessness.
I sent the message.
There is no British army.
You are alone.
Quite alone.
If this is true... then what difference can it make to you... if one man leaves or stays?
It is important to me.
Please explain to me the importance.
Because I am a man of mercy!
And I tell you go!
Leave in safety. Now.
You are not a man of mercy... for your visions have not revealed to you what mercy is... and so why do you do this?
You are not my enemy.
But I am.
You should understand,
Mohammed Ahmed... we are so alike, you and I.
You would welcome death, wouldn't you... if death could be the servant of your life?
Wouldn't you?
I, too.
If my life has a single point, it's this...
I've learned to be unafraid of death... but never to be unafraid of failure.
If by the act of surrendering my life...
I can bring down the world on your head... then it's an arrangement
I welcome.
Do you understand?
I'm sure you do.
If you, as a servant of your God... must use 100,000 warriors to destroy me... a solitary servant of my God... then you whisper to me,
Mohammed Ahmed... who will be remembered from Khartoum... your God or mine?
But Gordon Pasha, why should you be remembered?
You are forgotten.
Already.
Is it possible you still do not believe me?
I do not believe any infidel, even you, Gordon Pasha... can face a lonely death without terror.
Is it the Englishman whose name was Frank Power?
Is it the Frenchman whose name was Herbin?
Is it not your own ring?
Do you leave Khartoum?
I cannot leave Khartoum...
Mohammed Ahmed... for I, too, perform miracles... and you shall witness one.
While I may die of your miracle, you will surely die of mine.
Sir! The river!
So.
Here we are.
All right, then, gentlemen.
Fire!
Get back!
Fire one!
Well, Khaleel.
Take it away!
That is Abdullah.
I forbade it.
The relief came two days late.
Two days!
And for fifteen years, the Sudanese paid the price... with pestilence and famine, the British with shame and war.
Within months after Gordon died, the Mahdi died.
Why, we shall never know.
Gordon rests in his beloved Sudan.
We cannot tell how long his memory will live... but there is this...
"A world with no room for the Gordons...
"is a world that will return to the sands."
movement dance...
...born of the rhythm of the waves.
And my first perception music...
...sighs of the wind blowing in giant sequoias.
Because I was born by the sea, and all important events of my life...
...occurred at sea.
I was born under the star Aphrodite...
...the goddess of love and beauty. black bird, black bird,
</ i>...
...come stay with me...</ i>...
...Where the sun shines all year round. </ i>...
...is an improvised show?
Or is it a song?
Goodbye bye blackbird. </ i>.
It has good rhythm of jazz.
We can continue...
Where were we?
- No sign of Aphrodite.
I was born under the sign of Aphrodite...
...the goddess of love and beauty. also the sea...
At sea.
It is more romantic that way.
None of this is normal.
I want to write my truth not want to talk only of roses.
We are writing a great book.
We have to write at least thousand words.
We did not do anything yesterday.
Roger, asked for water again?
No. Only revision bills, love.
Dear Roger, I'll never have pen of Walter Scott.
I am a poor dancer.
Just dance.
Add more vitality.
Ok. Ok. It was enough.
Next.
Chopin waltz.
It could be an excellent dancer to put more feeling.
And it has legs, so beautiful.
Very beautiful even.
Come back when you learned to use them.
Fast, you're beautiful.

Make everything as it is in the agreement.
I do like who pays me, Mr. Sullivan. is the stage that attracts the public.
Remember, the public want.

I have to help my family in Europe.
- My family is great.
Now go dancing. will give me the $ 300...
...250 is the maximum.
I have my $ 300, yes or no?
Play the cloth.
He broke his promise.
I am poor and help my family.
He refuses to pay me.
Give you money.
Shut up.
Give them your money.
Three hundred...
Hey, honey, I have a great idea.
Greek Dance or cancan.

...representative of my destiny.
</ P> This is just a goal like...
...public, make a fortune here.
I am looking for my destination and not fortune.
Isto é apenas uma meta
Você gosta do público, fará fortuna aqui.
Estou procurando meu destino e não fortuna.
Roger, come here, I need you.
What is it?
Who is that man?
What?
- The man with glasses.
How do I know?
You know, everyone here knows.
It is important.
Many, it is superb.
It's a little fat.
Come, we must work.
I want to meet you.
He is a young Adonis.
Adonis. is probably someone's chauffeur.
Do not be so negative.
Do not be extravagant.
I'm naturally fancy, you'll see.
Look where you're going, you idiot. it was...
...it was.
My Adonis.
Crazy.
Poor Roger, messed his memory.
Your memory, not mine.
What kind of car was it?
How can I know?
A Bugatti, I think.
A Bugatti. What a beautiful name. </ P> It is
Italian? </ P> It may be the way he leads...
...almost killed us...
We die in our time.
This is no consolation.
But he hedged.
It may be a warning.
And he the messenger of the gods.
In 32 days we will be in England.
Can you imagine?
Let me enjoy this moment...
Já imaginou?.
Deixe-me saborear esse momento...
Sr. Raymond me ajude a embalar, vamos perder o barco.
Eu toco flauta para aliviar a tensão.
Raymond está trabalhando, mamãe. occupies that there is always beauty around us.
Continue to touch.
Let's take all these covers?
It will become Heavy...
...will be missed on board.
We must learn modes and speak words of poets and philosophers...
If we freeze we need < br /> the covers.
We must be strong, as Nietzsche tells us.
'And fight to the infinite.'
There is Europe, heaven and earth waiting to beautify it.
London, Paris, Berlin,
Florence, Athens...
Besieged museums, as occupied Paris Bastille.
We will bring to America,
Greek art that had been lost.
Igniting the spark.
Raymond, come.
'Greek Islands...
Gragas Islands...
...where Sappho loved the song. cradle of the arts of war and peace.'
I need more space.
Take a Champagne...
I prefer milk.
I would like an amphitheater
<br / > as the Greeks.
It is a more democratic form of theater.
Everyone can see well.
I would gladly give you that, anyway I'm happy to have him in my house.
Wonderful.
We have to organize the program.
Elizabeth, Raymond, and my mother always play piano...
I'm just a singer.
- I am sales representative. are very welcome. believed that he could build an amphitheater.
Duncan's family is very grateful,
Mrs. Campbell.
She gave the whole society Londrina.
The Londrina stops to admire.
Just do not want splurge, of course.
We went to the Plaza Kennsington,
Raymond played the flute, and I danced.
A nice Lady appears, wrapped in furs...
And ask?
'Where in the world are you?'
'In no part the world, 'said...
' We came from the moon.'
I'm fascinated, where he learned to dance.
I never learned, danced in the belly of my mother...
Exciting.
My father was a man unstable, he abandoned us.
My mother was inconsolable.
Just ate oysters and champagne...
...is the food of Aphrodite.
So I danced before birth.
It's a metaphor? Not.
No, it's my destiny. </ P> Roger.
What? </ P> Come...
What?
- Come here.
One of the difficult days.
Do you think that Mary loves me.
Sure.
She loves you.
Do not want to do anything.
Like what?
Come sit beside me.
I wrinkle my coat.
Lie go.
That's better.
What it does not allow <br / > you do?
Dance, for example.
She does not want me to dance.
I've always wanted to dance.
A dança, por exemplo.
Ela não quer que eu dance.
Sempre quis que dançasse.
Relax. seems an ironing board.
I'm not comfortable.
Poor Roger...
The water is boiling.
Not true, every time we touch on the subject...
...she tries to dissuade me.
To protect you </ p >.
I know. I'm old and fat...
Do you think I do not know.
I'll never dance. </ P> The gods give you and take you...
Not old nor fat.
I'm old and ugly...
Ridiculous.
Want a cup of tea?
You do not understand has no heart.
Whether or not.
Give me some brandy.
That's better...
What is good for most people.
O que é bom para a maioria das pessoas, is a deadly poison to me.
And tea is one of those things.
I still have beautiful arms, is not it?
- Yes.
I can be a nasty old...
...but I still have beautiful arms.
The arms are the last charm that a woman loses.
Mary.
Mary.
I have a check.
Pack your bags.
We went to Paris.
Paris? For what? </ P> What matters.
Just think... in Paris at dawn.
Do not worry. </ P>.
That check came from the gods.
The way to Paris.
How to pay the hotel.
Because we pay? never paid hotels.
That takes care of us passed.
I'm thrilled.
What do you have?
O que você tem? go faster.
What is it?
Tell me, I can help.
Stop the car.
- not.
What is Isadora.
I do not like tunnels.
We are out now.
We are going to Paris.
Yes, we're going to Paris.
It's him.
Mary, is it.
Stop, turn around.
My God, I never see it again. should have gone to the restaurant.
Do you think? had not thought of that.
Waiter.
Do you know a man who is driving a Bugatti.
Dear Isadora-
- Archer.
As always beautiful.
Especially today...
Because I'm rich and I'm in love.
We are looking for a nice young man. just gone.
- will return.
Martin Bedford is here.
He will join us.
It is a artist?
An aspirant. is brilliant?
It's very rich.
How do you Duncan? remarkably well.
I always wanted to meet her.
My mother saw her dancing in London.
Continue...</ p >.
She loves me?
You do not have their own point of view.
That's not what I meant...
So why mention it?
You are a legend of his time, not.
A legend in my time...
...has just offend me in a horrible way.
And the new book, Archer.
I do not know. I only write things...
Lamb evolve to a lion.
We all have a little lions.
I totally agree.
- Why?
Because I love lions.
Wait a minute.
Let's get some rest.
No. Do not stop. </ P>
Dance again. </ P> Please.
Who's there? </ P> My name is Craig. </ P>.
I am a decorator, set designer.
Thanks.
You do not know me yet...
I saw you dancing, before the blue curtains in Paris.
I could not believe it.
It's exactly as I imagined.
I had to see her alone. </ p >
It would have been terrible...
...talking in the middle of a lot of people.
I had to be safe.
Eu tinha que vê-la sozinha.
Teria sido terrível falar no meio de um monte de gente.
Eu tinha que estar seguro. sure.
You.
Is it safe now?
It is extraordinary.
Meeting.
My dear, we are getting married.
I can not, I have commitments.
Nonsense. Who? </ P> My mother-. -Who.
Your mother... The meeting between
Gordon Craig and Isadora Duncan...
...can not take place because.
Miss Duncan has his mother. </ P> I know all...
...about the family circus
< br /> with travelers.
It is not a circus.
An artist does not need a family.
I have no family and never I have one.
I have my mother.
It is a great artist.
She understands me.
I have a job to be done:
Ela é uma grande artista.
Ela me entende.
Eu tenho um trabalho a ser feito:
Create a world stage, a new unit...
...for the actor, designers and dancers...
...where the dancer will dance with the light that I create.
My light and My decoration.
The World on stage is my inspiration.
Enter.
.. Feel at home.
Do not be standing in the doorway...
Among... Look at this...</ p > See... is a possible version of their choreography.
It's beautiful.
It's true...
And this... let's see.
I designed this for the first act of Hamlet.
The light pattern is the same as this, the same design. </ p >...
It's beautiful.
- More than this, is an entirely new decor.
I could not believe when
I saw her dancing...
I thought I was having a vision, because I made that up.
I did not know this existed.
We were two strangers, as two stars in the same sky, who have crossed and are united, by fate.
Stop in the light.
Very good.
There is absolutely, as I thought.
And what did you expect?
There are two theories...
One is that you would be a kind of ruler of Milwaukee, who plays on the stage barefoot, very well behaved.
That's what they think?
Some, yes.
Others feel that, her dancing is indecent. all say it is 'a great artist.'
And you, what do you think?
They do not see what I see in you.
The priestess, the revolutionary.
Really? And what else? </ P> What are two parts with one head, need to come together. </ P>
Soulmates. As brothers...
...together for the glory.
They went together, no mortal could separates them, armor black as night.
Enough talk... Take a moment.
Take these sandals. </ P> A woman of Eros not need them. </ P> Magnificent.
Magnificent.
Yes, I know.
You belong to me.
Ted... I was thinking.
I always tell everybody,
Sim, eu sei.
Você pertence a mim.
Ted... estava pensando.
Sempre digo a todo mundo, if anything is sacred the human body is.
I thought I knew what I was saying... Wrong
Not yet had you known.
Why did not I say when a man is beautiful.
Well.
If we can capture before it moves, we the moonlight when we want.
Will you let me paint too?
No, I paint, you dance.
Dance to immobilize the moon. moon, which is in heaven...
...my beloved tries to capture its light for ever.
Oh Moon. Stop your brightness, you as my beloved pictures.
</ P> Then she stopped...
...moving? </ P> No, it only obeys the virgins.
I challenge thee, Moon.
Não, ela só obedece as virgens.
Eu te desafio, lua.
Do not walk on it, is ruining all of my work.
Ruined my drawing.
You paint all purple, scarlet woman.
You will see.
Food.
Do not say anything, I know that is bread and sausage.
A bit expensive, do not eat anything.
And to drink?
- Syrup.
I saw one of his posters.
'Show canceled due to the unwillingness <br / > Miss Duncan.'
Miss Duncan is sick and can not dance.
I feel very bad.
What day is it? </ p >.
Friday.
Friday, we are here for a week.
My mother must be on the verge of madness.
Now you can talk about your business.
Well, Miss Duncan had an upset.
Yes, a reprehensible act.
You are a woman without morals.
True, true. can die of love.
Archer, what next?
Continue... I do not know the lyrics.
Someone must know the lyrics.
Do you know the lyrics to Charleston?
No, ma'am.
No one know the lyrics? Who know he could sing.
Mr. Bedford, know some of your time?
Whether singing.
I think I know, 'Everybody Loves My Baby
.' </ P> Great, sing.
No, do not stop.
It's terrible.
Where did you learn this, how awful.
I'm sorry...
- It's stupid. Stupid...
Desculpe...
- É estúpido. Estúpido.
You know what I said when I was asked my opinion about jazz...
'Jazz is the left foot of Isadora Duncan.'
Mary, my star...
- Isadora, I'm going back.
We are going to Paris.
No, it's late, we will tomorrow.
Tomorrow does not exist.
Mary. Asked the foreman, what's his name? </ P> No, but come here many times.
Paris-What then wait.
Isadora, we will off.
- Archer will give a party tonight.
I'm tired, I will.
- Ok, send me the driver.
I did not want go with it.
I hate to be alone with women, I feel a nun.
What we do now?
Ted.
You came to see me.
You came to see me.
Você veio me ver.
Você veio me ver.
It is the way to the Antipodes, across the world.
Come walk with the wind.
What made you come to this place lost.
Mom wanted me to protect from prying eyes...
There is much to hide.
Do you know how she calls me?
'The vile seducer '...
When you said this is his nickname.
In the scene of Indians, <br / > the train gold, gold will have an effect.
In the play the King and Queen, the scene outside cover the entire bottom of the central area.
When Hamlet stabs Polonius,
Claudius appears...
...before, his shadow is cast in Hamlet.
It's wonderful.
Yes, it's wonderful.
We should test this in Moscow. of impatience.
You should come to me, after solve it.
Yes, yes I will.
He directed to me, and almost killed me.
We had never spoken before, and fetched me this beautiful Bugatti.
I would buy one, if I had money.
I thought you were rich.
- I'm rich for other things, but not to buy a Bugatti.
You're rich, right?

Ok, we'll look at another momemto.
Bem, está decidido.
- Não se incomoda?
Isadora, estou no meio de um tratamento.
Ok, falaremos em outro momemto. will take you to the Frog Prince.
What?
I do not understand.
Do not you understand?
'History the frog that turns into a prince '
' Only the princess can see who really was the frog '.
Do you think my servants do not tell me everything?
Was spying on me?
- It is a scandal, everyone knows.
What-ordinary.
- I spend well I want loyalty.
Fidelity is one of my most salient features.
So I'm in love, a genial man, < br /> your soul shines in your eyes.
A man-hungry... Go and take your frog.

I'm looking for a new life.
Love the Bugatti. </ P> A valley full of < br /> flowers and happiness.
Do not cut the deck, Isadora. bad luck.
Soul of the universe... flow into me.
Death.
Death always appears in the first letter.
It also means 'harvest'.
The patient-lover.
Let's see tomorrow.
Me leave sated with love.
- Just be open to that.
The second The moon letter....
Death on the moon, what to say, Pim.
Death by water.
A morte sobre a lua, o quê quer dizer, Pim?
Morte por água.
For months, I had misgivings...
Why is ignored.
This morning, when the nurse calmed children...
...not to molest me...
I said 'Let them play.
' What would we do without <br
/ > the sound of their voices? '.
Once a psychic told me...
...would lose what had more expensive in the world.
However, not heard. always had hallucinations, but did not pay attention...
Singer sent me a message that said: 'Come I see, 'and I went.
On the way...
...with children in my arms...
I felt full of hope...
Often, as a enchanted tale, heard a voice.
I thought it was going to see... Singer with children, it would be easier.
There are...
...my poor, fragile...
...and beautiful children.
Singer wanted to talk to me alone, and send the children for a stroll in Paris.
I gave them a kiss.
I kissed the glass instead of kissing her lips.
This contact cold still remains in my lips.
There are pain-killing.
This tragedy...
...ended with no desire to a normal and happy life.
Since then...
...I'm only as a consolation fly...
...fly to escape this horror endless.
My life has just been a series of fights.
In a ghost ship...
...in an ocean phantom.
Moments of my life that I remember with great joy...
...were taught as children.
And it would be well again.
In the spring of 1921,
I received a telegram from the Soviet government...
It was a wonderful simplicity.
'Only the government can understand Russian. point.
' Come with us. Point.
You build a school.'</ P>.
So I left the old world...
...and I was willing to receive the new.
The lights went out.
- Bring lamps.
Isadora, Isadora...
Here Comrade... have a lamp.
Comrades Silence.
Keep on dancing.
I will continue...
...but I want to sing to me. mas quero que cantem para mim.
Russia with great expectations.
I had promised a school...
...with a thousand students.
Because it was a bad time.
They came to me for food and shelter.
Children are homeless and hungry, they said.
'Dance is a luxury.
Give them bread.'
So I made a decision...
...nourish the body and spirit
< br /> these children.
The government could not give us material aid...
...just an old building.
So I said it would take me only fifty children.
It would power more than that.
Here, in a large room...
...failed in a palace, without hot water...
...no beds, no mattresses...
...and the furniture of the former owner were confiscated by the state.
I was opening my new dance school.
It is Mary's calling you.
I thought.
I have the address.
From Mr. Bugatti.
What? </ p > That said.
Bugatti.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
I saw hungry and misery in Moscow...
...but... the life of an artist is different from that of a saint. found different ways to forget.
I made friends among Russian poets , artists, writers...
We'd secretly vodka and champagne.
The idol of this generation...
...was the poet Sergei Yesenin.
Us: Sergei Alexssander...
The first time I heard it, he recited a poem.
He talks about the plains where he was born...
He said that is lost as you, who can not return... dedicated this poem to you, ma'am.
I know...
I know.
I did not know that a poet could be so beautiful...
...as his verses.
Tell him.
What did he say?
What derperdiçou your life.
Love is their only hope.
You're my man gold.
Man Gold.
It is a book.
It's a pencil.
The pencil is red.
This pencil is blue.
No, it's red.
Sergei not speak to that.
As they say: 'I want to make love '.
How do you say 'I love you'.
Very well, write. e...'You have beautiful legs?' </ P> I beg.
Sergei, has wonderful legs.
</ P> Write 'I love you.
You have beautiful thighs.'
As they say:' We love like tigers '.
Answer me.
Answer me.
We love like tigers.
Tigers around the world, unite.
Where were you?
Affection... affection...
Enough.
Enough.
Damn...
Husband?
- No.
It is not my husband.
That man, husband.
Husband.
Farewell, husband.
No, Sergei.
- You're horrible.
Adeus, marido.
Não, Sergei.
- És horrível. will bite it is very strong.
Here's what I do...
Poor old...
Goodbye, young man.
Goodbye everybody.
Goodbye everybody.
We do not need you, Isadora.
Farewell, old life.
Goodbye, children.
No, not them.
No children, no.
Children not.
Have mercy.
Your husband is dead.
His sons are dead.
I'm your husband.
His children, I am.
Isadora, who is this man? Who is he? </ P>
The man who is in the studio. </ P> Oh, it...
Have you seen him?
- Yes.
Oh, ele...
Você o viu?
- Sim.
Eu estou falando de... Bugatti.
No, it was when I arrived. offer 1,200 francs for everything. What do you think? </ P>-I think it's good.
Isadora, what's going on? </ P> I made a decision. </ P> sell everything.
My property, my property, everything.
I'm going to Paris, ask for Elizabeth...
...bring 12 of the best students in the school...
...of Moscow.
We will celebrate recital... and a new school.
Wonderful.
Mary, I'll get back to work to save my life.
Here they are.
What a beautiful couple.
Wow.
What think you have a passport?
American or Russian?
Who knows?
Sorry, can not move from here.
Welcome to America.
Easy. Silence.
Lamento, não podem passar daqui.
Bem-vindos à América.
Calma. Silêncio. ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Yesenin, will speak to everyone.
I bring the greetings of the young the Soviet Union.
During Revolution the United States helped us a lot...
...sending food and blankets.
I'm here to give back.
The soul of America and the soul of Russia...
...should strive to understand.
Miss Duncan, as does to stay so young? </ p >.
I want you to eat and drink, and I am married to a handsome man.
Why so long refused to give them visa.
Some officers think that having a Russian passport...
...makes you a criminal bloodthirsty.
Why became a Russian citizen?
Because I fell in love with a Russian. had the bitter experience of note, to a man and a woman can not sleep together in a hotel...
...if they are not husband and wife.
Have you finished?.
- No, my love, wait...
...finished.
Sergei, did not recite some poems.
Miss Duncan, will give recitals
Russian ballet, and Mr. Yesenin include poems.
It is true that her husband was violent with you on the ship?
There was a party and as every Russian break some objects.
If they had participated, may have done the same.
Describes itself a communist?
Sergei and I are artists, and as we all revolutionary authenticity.
It's not about politics.
I do not believe that revolution is political.
</ P> If people listen to your heart, would listen to him...
...would know how better to live..
I think this would be the real revolution.
Sergusha, will read his poems.
Tell them I'm coming.
Go.
Poems in Russian. Excellent.
Will be a great story. </ P> Tell them
I'm coming. </ P> Day I'm coming.
Go, go. I.
Now, Sergei tell a poem.
It's about the Soviet Union and about America.
Extend hands < br /> as I have done.
Agora, Sergei dirá um poema.
É sobre a União Soviética e sobre a América.
Estendam as mãos assim como eu fiz.
Sr. Yesenin, é um Bolchevique?
- Sou um poeta.
This morning, I bought this Isadora.
North American poetry is.
It's beautiful.
Lindo.
- Are you sure he's okay?
I'll tell you my first poem to America. is shooting.
Quiet. Calm.
It's just a joke.
There are real bullets.
There are real bullets.
A calamity crossed our borders...
...and entered into our land.
A plague in the form of two Bolsheviks, revolutionaries, agitators...
...that should never have come here. have no right to be here.
And here...
...must be expelled in the name of Jesus Christ.
My friends, I say: that will.
What is going to Russia.
Do not come corrupting the soul of our people.
Will I there people also have a soul?
Return to Russia.
Communist red.
This woman, believe which is a dancer.

They are ashes.
Afraid of freedom.
Are you afraid that artists enjoy your freedom.
Return, undead. return.
I wanted to dance for you...
'Deliverance <br / > of the Russian people '.
Because I thought that
America would understand...
...forgot to do their own revolution.
Do we violent? not be tamed.
You're rich, Isadora, rich.
Do not be sad.
Go with you in Paris. We will be together. </ P> I won 800 francs that...

Well, Thomas Becket, are you satisfied?
Here I am stripped, kneeling at your tomb while those treacherous
Saxon monks of yours are getting ready to thrash me.
Me, with my delicate skin.
I bet you'd never have done the same for me.
But, I suppose I have to do this penance and make my peace with you.
What a strange end to our story.
How cold it was when we last met on the shores of France.
Funny, it's nearly always been cold, except at the beginning when we were friends.
We did have a few, fine summer evenings with the giris.
Did you love
Gwendolen, Archbishop?
Did you hate me the night I took her from you, shouting, "I am the King"?
Perhaps that's what you could never forgive me for.
Look at them lurking there, gloating.
Oh, Thomas,
I'm ashamed of this whole silly masquerade.
All right, so I've come here to make my peace with their Saxon hero, because I need them now, those Saxon peasants of yours.
Now I'll call them my sons, as you wanted me to, you taught me that too.
You taught me everything.
Those were the happy times.
Do you remember?
At the peep of dawn and as usual we'd been drinking and wenching in the town.
You were even better at that than I was.
Shhh, listen.
Upstairs.
She's up with someone.
Well, go on up.
Get up man, get on up there!
Quick, out through the window.
Thank you.
Come on now.
Come on.
Come on.
Come here.
I'll lay my hands on her, the dirty slut.
Where is he the swine?
You don't, don't you dare, don't you dare.
Here catch.
Go on, get in there.
Here take my good boot.
I can't get my boot back on.
Faster now.
Oh, rub harder pig,
I'm cold.
Ah, no one does it the way you do, Thomas.
Thank you.
I think you actually like the cold.
I made you a nobleman, why do you play at being my valet?
I'm your servant in the council chamber, or here in the bath.
My Norman Barons resent it, they feel it's your Saxon way of mocking their nobility.
Nobility lies in the man, My Prince, not in the towel.
Have you any idea how much trouble
I took to make you noble?
I think so,
I recall you pointed a finger and said,
"Thomas Becket you are noble".
The Queen and your mother became very agitated.
They're always agitated.
No, I mean trouble from the Barons, they hate you, you know?
Of course, one always hates what one wrongs.
When you Norman's invaded England, you seized our Saxon land, burned our Saxon homes, raped our Saxon sisters.
Naturally you hate Saxons.
Don't include me, it was my great grandfather William who was called
"The Conqueror",
I'm an old resident.
I did not mean you.
Didn't you?
You know when I took you into my service, everyone predicted you'd put a knife in my back.
Did you believe them?
No, I showed them that you were a man of honor, and a collaborator.
That was accurate of you.
How do you combine the two?
My Lord?
Honor and collaboration?
I don't try.
I love good living, and good living is Norman.
I love life and the
Saxons only birthright is to be slaughtered.
One collaborates to live.
And honor?
Honor is a concern of the living.
One can't very well be concerned about it once one's dead.
You're too clever for me, Thomas, but I know there's something not quite right about your reasoning.
Honor is a private matter within, it's an idea and every man has his own version of it.
How gracefully you tell your King to mind his own business.
Time for the council meeting, My Lord.
Ugh.
Will My Lord dine with me tonight?
On gold plates?
Always.
I am your King, and I eat off silver.
Your expenses are heavy,
I have only my pleasure to pay for.
Tonight you can do me the honor of christening my forks.
Forks?
Yes, from Florence.
A new little invention, it's for pronging meat and carrying it to the mouth, it saves you dirtying your fingers.
Then you dirty the fork.
Yes, but its washable.
So are you fingers,
I don't see the point.
Well, it hasn't any practically speaking but it's refined, it's subtle, it's very un-Norman.
You must order me some.
For my Barons.
I have enough forks to go around, bring the gentleman with you tonight.
I shall.
We won't tell them what they're for.
They'll probably think they're a new kind of dagger.
All right, gentlemen, the Council is open.
Gentlemen,
I've called you here to find out why a simple request for taxes causes such unpriestly caterwauling.
My Lord...
We must come to an understanding about who rules this kingdom, the church...
My Lord, I wish to ask you...
Just a moment, Archbishop.
The church, or me?
There are many troublesome issues between us, which call for a reckoning.
Amongst other abuses is the claim you make of judging your clergy accused of civil crimes in your own ecclesiastical courts.
I warn you, there can be only one justice in this country, and that is the Kings.
But before we quarrel, here is some happy news.
I have decided to revive the office of
Chancellor of England, keeper of the Lion's Seal, and entrust it to our loyal servant
Thomas Becket.
Yes, my little Saxon?
My Lord?
Well, for once I've taken you by surprise.
My Lord, this is a stupendous honor, for which I may not be worthy.
I'm inexperienced in these matters and frivolous by nature.
Rubbish, you know more than all of us put together.
He's read books you know, its amazing.
He's drunk and wenched his way through London but he's thinking all the time, aren't you, Thomas?
He'll checkmate the lot of you, even you Archbishop.
I never did anything without your advice.
No one knew it, now everyone will, that's all.
There, that's the
Great Seal of England, don't lose it, without the seal there's no more England and we'll all have to pack up and go back to Normandy.
May I crave leave to greet our young and learned friend, for I noticed him when he was first made Archdeacon.
Thank you, Archbishop, but don't rely too much on Becket to play your game, he's my man.
I'd forgotten you were an Archdeacon, Thomas.
So had I, My Prince.
Now to business.
The law demands that every landowner send soldiers to give me service or pay a tax in silver, is that correct?
I have heard so, My Lord.
We are about to cross the channel to force Louis of France to return the Norman towns he has taken from us.
I have received neither soldiers nor silver from you gentlemen, for this war.
But surely one must distinguish between the individual landowner and God's church?
The law doesn't distinguish.
But this has never been spoken of before.
I've never been this poor before.
No, I've made up my mind and I'm passing around the plate, just drop in the money.
Oh, my backside's sore.
Is that all, count your blessings, Sire.
I don't know about you, Thomas, but I'm starving, have them bring us something to eat.
The layman who shirks his duty and fails to supply his King with arms should pay the tax, nobody will question that.
Least of all the clergy.
On the other hand, a priest's duty is to assist his
King with his prayers for Godliness and peace, he cannot maintain men at arms without violating the very essence of that sacred function therefore he cannot be held liable for the tax.
Your priest fought well enough in the days of a conquest when there was booty to be had.
Sword in fist, rumps in the saddle, death to Saxons scum, it's God's will, it's God's will.
Those violent days are over.
The priest is back in his sanctuary it is peacetime now.
But not for long, pay up,
I don't intend to budge.
Come on Chancellor, say something, has your new title made you tongue-tied?
May I respectfully draw to My Lord
Archbishop's attention one small point?
Respectfully but firmly, you're Chancellor now.
England is a ship, the King is the captain of the ship.
That's neat, I like that.
My Lord Chancellor, in point of fact, there is also a saying the captain is sole master after God.
After God!
Nobody's questioning
God's authority, Archbishop.
Most certainly God protects the ship by inspiring the captain but I've never heard that he determines the wages of the crew, nor instructs the paymaster in his duties.
God has more important business.
Our young deacon's ambition has carried him away from the church but he cannot have forgotten that what is important is revealed to man only through his church in the person of our
Holy Father in Rome, his bishops and his priests.
Or does the Chancellor think otherwise?
True, there is a priest onboard every ship.
He gives God's blessings, but neither God nor the church ask him to take the wheel from the helmsman.
My Reverend Lord, the Bishop of London who I understand is the son of a sailor surely cannot have forgotten that.
I will not allow personal insinuation to compromise the integrity and honor of the church.
Please, Bishop, no long words.
All that's at stake here is its money.
I need money to fight the French, will the church give it to me, yes or no?
My Lord, your illustrious ancestor
William the Conqueror granted these tax exemptions to the church.
May he rest in peace, where he is now, he doesn't need money.
I'm still on Earth and I do.
This is not primarily a question of money,
Your Highness, this is a question of principle.
I need troops, Bishop.
I've sent for 3,000 Swiss to help me fight the King of France and no one has ever paid the Swiss with principles.
My Lord, Chancellor, it is pointless to continue this discussion.
The law has given us the means of coercion, we will use it.
You, you owe everything to Holy Mother Church.
Would you dare plunge a dagger into her bosom?
My Lord and King who rules by the grace of God, has given me his seal with the three lions to protect.
My mother is England now.
Traitor,
Saxon.
My Reverend friend,
I strongly suggest that you respect my Chancellor or else I'll call my guards.
Ahh, here they are now.
Oh, no, it's only my snack.
Now, gentlemen, if you will excuse me, at this hour in the morning
I need sustenance or else I tend to feel weak and a king must never weaken,
I'm sure you will agree.
I'll have it in my chapel.
Then I can pray directly afterwards.
Come on, Thomas, keep me company.
He means it's time for the hunt.
Not until we have eaten, my dear Bishop.
Race?
Right.
The Kings hunt.
Eh?
Oh, inside quick.
Let's get under cover before we're drowned.
We've lost the Barons.
Oh, they'll find us, here, hold this.
Oh, I'm cold, my pretty.
Go on sit on there, that's a good girl.
Go on, get on there.
I'm freezing, get the fire going.
There'll be no wood in this house.
In the middle of the forest?
These people are entitled to two measures of deadwood a year, one branch more and they hang.
My edict?
Your edict.
Come here, old man.
We need firewood.
Don't be afraid.
Thomas!
Thomas, come here!
Look at this.
She stinks a bit but we could wash her, what would you think of it, cleaned up a little?
She's a child.
What would it be like when it's a woman.
How old would you say it was, 16, 17?
It can speak, My Lord, how old are you.
Eh?
Of course it can speak.
How old's your daughter, dog?
Odd the number of dumb people I meet when I set foot out of my palace,
I rule over a kingdom of mutes.
They're afraid.
Quite right, too.
Don't stand there, put the wood on the fire.
Hello, pretty.
Look at it.
The odd thing is it's so ugly, yet it makes such pretty daughters.
You're a member of the family, explain that?
Well, at 20 before he lost his teeth and took on that ageless look the common people have, he may have been handsome.
He may have had one night of love, one moment when he was a king and shed his fear.
Afterwards, his paupers life went on eternally the same.
The moment faded and he forgot it all, the seed was sown.
Will she grow ugly too?
Surely.
If we made her a whore and kept her at the palace, would she stay pretty?
Perhaps.
Then we'd be doing her a service, wouldn't we?
No doubt.
Look at it, it understands every word.
Stop staring at me, dog, get me something to drink.
I have some drink in my saddle.
What's the matter, Thomas?
Nothing.
I'm getting you a drink.
Thank you, Thomas.
Our escort. want some?
What's the matter, you hurt?
It's nothing.
Show me.
Now you know you can't stand the sight of blood.
My horse bit me.
That is too funny.
My Lord here, makes us all look silly at the jousts with his fancy horsemanship, he goes to his saddlebags and gets bitten like a groom.
You look quite shaken, little Saxon.
Funny, I can't bear to think of you in pain.
All this just to get me a drink wounded in the service of the king.
This deserves a gift.
What would you like?
This girl,
I fancy her.
That's very tiresome of you,
I fancy her myself, and where that subjects concerned friendship goes by the boar.
All right, she's yours.
Thank you, My Prince.
But you will return the favor equally one day.
At your pleasure.
Equally, favor for favor, you give me your word as a gentleman?
I do.
Right, she's yours.
Shall we take her with us or shall we have her sent?
No, no, no, the soldiers can bring her.
Wash your daughter, dog, and kill her fleas, she's coming to the palace for My Lordship here.
He's a Saxon too, so I hope you'll be pleased.
Give him money, Thomas,
I'm feeling generous this morning.
Don't worry about your daughter, nobody will come to take her away,
I'll see to that.
And tell your son he should stay hidden in the forest until he can handle a knife better.
Here.
Forgive me, not for fighting, my dear Baron, for eating.
Go on, it's lovely.
Noisy brutes.
You seem to spend a great deal of time in their company.
No, I can forget it when I come to you.
I'm happy that
I can relieve you.
Now don't tease me tonight, Gwendolen.
I'm off to France again tomorrow, and war.
I am My Lord's captive, whatever his purpose and whatever his mood.
I hope so.
It is God's will, since he gave the Norman's victory over my people.
And that's the only reason you're here?
If the Welsh had won the war,
I would have married a man of my own race at my father's castle.
God did not will it so.
All right.
I'm sorry I was so late coming to you but the King is demanding and the Barons have to be kept at bay.
I'm lying, you are My Lord,
God or no God.
If we had won the war, you could just as easily have taken me from my father's castle.
I would have come with you for you had taken my heart before you captured my body.
Have I said something wrong?
Somehow I can never support the idea of being loved.
I told you that.
Oh, please.
Sit.
Play something, something sad, it helps the digestion.
Play.
Oh, sweet and melancholy.
Sit, Thomas, witness one of my finer moments.
I behave like a brute, but I'm as soft as swan's down inside.
You know, Thomas, sometimes I think that you and I are the only civilized men in England.
I eat with a fork, and you've made me into a man of the most delicate sensibilities and now if you really love me you should find me a beautiful well bred girl to give me a little polish.
Favor for favor, do you remember?
I am your servant, My Lord.
All that I have is yours.
But you are also gracious enough to say
I am your friend.
Yes, that's what I mean, as one friend to another.
You do care for her then?
You do care about something?
Or do you?
Go on, tell me, tell me if you care for her or not?
I said, "favor for favor" and I asked for your word.
And I gave it to you.
Right.
Well, that's settled then.
May I have a moment's grace?
Surely, surely.
After all, I'm not a savage.
Did you promise me to him?
No.
I promised him anything he asked for.
I never thought it would be you.
If he sends me away tomorrow, will you take me back?
No.
I leave you this, you've almost learned to play it.
You've not found anything in the whole worid to care for, have you?
No.
We both belong to a conquered race, but you've forgotten that people robbed of everything can still have one thing left to call their own.
Yes, where honor should be, in me there is only a void.
I loved you,
Thomas Becket.
My Lord.
Enter.
How careless you are, Thomas, you had forgotten her.
But you told me that you fancied her and I remembered.
You see I really am your friend and you're wrong not to love me.
Goodnight, Sire.
Shall I undress, My Lord?
What?
Shall I undress?
Thomas?
Thomas?
She's dead.
She's killed herself.
All this blood.
Help me, Thomas,
I'm frightened.
I'm the King!
Get rid of her.
Guard.
I'm sleeping here tonight.
Give this girl a silver piece and let her go.
He won't hurt you.
I don't want to be alone tonight.
I'm here, My Prince.
You'll hate me now.
I'll never be able to trust you.
You have nothing to fear.
You gave me your seal, and while I wear it my duty is to my king.
But I'll never know what you're thinking.
Sleep now.
We cross the channel tomorrow.
When we face the French on the field of battle there will be simple answers to everything, so long as Becket must improvise his honor from day to day, he will serve you faithfully.
But what if one day he should meet his honor in truth, face to face?
But where is Becket's honor?
An early good morning to you, gentlemen,
I've just ridden from the town.
I've arranged for its capitulation.
Well, will there be loot?
No, I want these people to collaborate with good grace.
The French Bishop will deliver the keys of the city to the King at eight o'clock in the cathedral.
No fighting, what are we here for?
To secure King Henry's possessions in France.
You have three more towns to recapture.
I'd rather sack the town and slaughter the lot.
Yes, and have a dead city.
No, I want to give the King living cities to increase his wealth.
From dawn this morning
I'm the townspeople's dearest friend.
And what of England's pride?
England's pride, my dear Baron is to succeed.
What a mentality.
Chancellor of England.
Who knows what he is, he's a Saxon.
Release him.
Leave us Sergeant.
My Lord?
Leave us.
What are you, a Saxon monk doing in France, they'll kill you, you know?
I'm prepared to die.
How old are you?
Hmm, dying is easy at 18.
Your knife stinks of onions like every proper little Saxon's knife.
You used to be a Saxon.
Now you belong to the Normans.
I see.
A Saxon knife for a Saxon collaborator.
Did you think that by killing me you could liberate your race?
No, not my race, myself.
From what?
My shame and yours.
The Normans have occupied England for a hundred years since Hastings, shame is an old vintage to the Saxon.
Your father and your grandfather drank it to the dregs.
The cup is empty now.
No, never.
What's your name?
What is your name?
John.
Sergeant.
Well, Brother John,
I'm going to save your life.
It has no importance for me but it's very rare for fate to bring one face to face with one's own ghost when young.
My Lord?
Have this monk returned to England to the custody of the
Abbott of his monastery.
I want him treated without brutality, but carefully watched.
Yes, My Lord.
My Lord?
Good morning, My Lord.
Oh, French wine.
I had a little too much last night.
It's their major contribution to civilization.
Here's another.
I must say I adore my French possessions, they're certainly worth recapturing.
What's your name, my pretty?
Name?
Marie.
Marie, very French.
A French luxury is very luxurious.
And for the moment free.
We take possession of the town this morning.
Yes, I heard.
You managed that very well, Thomas.
Personally, I shall miss the fighting, meanwhile we have some business to discuss.
I've been studying the dispatches from England.
You love work don't you?
If you love anything.
I love doing what I have to do, and doing it well.
You'd be as efficient against me as for me, wouldn't you?
If fate had arranged it that way.
So what in most people is morality, in you it's just an exercise in, what's the word?
Aesthetics.
Yes, that's the word.
Always, aesthetics.
Yes.
Well now, look at that.
Isn't that aesthetic, too?
Some people go into ecstasies over cathedrals but that's a work of art.
Look at it, round as an apple.
Want her?
Business, My Lord.
All right, business.
Sit down.
Listen carefully, Marie, to the droppings of the greatest brain of our day.
Now piecing together all the information
I've received from London there are some unpleasant deductions to be made.
The power of the
Bishops is increasing like the pestilence, soon it will rival your own.
Talk sense, Thomas, priests are always intriguing but I can crush them anytime I wish.
If you don't crush them now, in five year's time there will be two
Kings of England, the Archbishop of
Canterbury and you, in ten year's time there will be only one.
And it won't be me?
I fear not.
Grant to horse,
Thomas, to horse, war on the clergy, death to the Archbishop.
My Lord, I can't breathe.
What are you doing down there, spying for the clergy?
Be off with you.
Put on your clothes and go home.
My Lord, am I to come back to the camp tonight?
Yes, no,
I don't know.
I'm thinking of priests now, not you, go away.
Wait, I'd rather be sure
I'm getting another one as good.
Yes, come back tonight.
You're adorable.
You must always tell them that, even when you pay.
That's high politics too.
Only one, it won't be me?
It won't be you.
But what will God say if I attack his church, after all they're his bishops?
We must manage the church.
One can always come to a, sensible little arrangement with God.
Becket, you're a monster.
You flatter me, My Lord.
But please,
My Lord, dress quickly.
It's, it's inelegant for conquerors to be late.
You're a monster.
You see, they love us dearly, these French.
So they should, we paid them enough.
In that case, we should have found some that didn't dress out of a rag barrel.
The rich are at home sulking.
Supporters of
King Louis of France?
No, it just would've cost too much.
That sounds real.
Yes, we have soldiers disguised in the crowd to encourage enthusiasm.
Why must you destroy all of my illusions?
Because you should have none, My Prince.
What do you see?
Reality.
Stop here!
The Bishop is waiting.
As if it mattered what
I do with a Bishop whose city I've just taken.
It matters.
Am I the strongest, or am I not?
You are today, but one must never drive one's enemy to despair, it makes him strong gentleness is better politics, it saps virility.
A good occupational force must never crush, it must corrupt.
Make a note of the house.
Oh, never mind.
My Lord, the Bishop.
Yes, papa.
No, papa.
Put your men at rest, Captain.
Is this William, of Corbeil?
Yes, Sire.
I hardly recognized you without a tankard covering your face.
How did they pry you away from it?
I had urgent messages from
London for you, My Lord.
It seems that God is on our side after all, Thomas.
What is that, My Prince?
He's just recalled the
Archbishop of Canterbury to his bosom.
That frail old man, he was the first Norman to take an interest in me.
God rest his soul.
He will, he will and he'll be much more use to God than he ever was to me.
Thomas.
An extraordinary idea is creeping into my mind.
A masterstroke,
I'm suddenly very intelligent.
It probably comes from making love to that French girl last night.
I'm subtle,
I'm even profound.
Oh, I'm so profound it's making my head spin.
Are you listening to me, Thomas?
I'm listening, My Prince.
We need a new
Archbishop of Canterbury.
I think there is a man we can rely on.
No matter who it is, once the Archbishop's miter is on his head he will not longer be on your side.
But if the
Archbishop is my man, if Canterbury is for the King, how could his power possibly get in my way?
My Lord, we know your bishops, once enthroned at Canterbury, every one of them will grow dizzy with power.
Not this man.
This is someone who doesn't know what dizziness means, someone who isn't afraid of God.
I'm sorry to deprive you of the French giris and the other spoils of victory but, are you listening to me, Thomas?
You're leaving for England tonight.
On what mission, My Prince?
You are going to deliver a letter to all the bishops of England.
Uh-huh.
My royal edict nominating you, Thomas Becket,
Primate of England,
Archbishop of Canterbury.
Shut up.
Thomas, I'm in deadly earnest.
My Lord, don't do this.
You have an odd way of taking good news.
I should think you'd be triumphant.
But I, I'm not even a priest.
You're a deacon, you can be ordained priest and consecrated
Archbishop the next day.
Have you considered what the Pope would say?
I'll pay his price.
My Lord, this frightens me.
I thought you had God in the palm of your hand, Thomas.
I beg of you, do not do this.
You've never disappointed me, Thomas, and you're the only man I can trust.
You'll leave for
England tonight.
Becket?
Thank you for returning to us the keys of our city.
The die is cast, Thomas, make the most of it.
And if I know you,
I'm sure you will.
There you are.
Thank you, My Lord.
Thank you, My Lord.
You're welcome, it will keep you warm.
He'll only sell it for drink.
Then that will keep him warm.
Yes, Your Grace.
No, not Your Grace,
I will not be consecrated
Archbishop until tomorrow.
I'm sorry, Father.
That is temporarily correct.
You don't really intend to give away your winter cloaks?
Everything, has all the gold plate been sold?
Yes, the money from the sales is in those purses.
Excellent, bring me the rest of the money.
But Your Grace...
I mean, Father...
Everything.
Well, welcome to
Canterbury, My Lord Bishop, is anything wrong?
May I ask what is happening here?
Go sell all that thou hast and give it to the poor and thou shal't have treasure in heaven.
I doubt if the Lord, Jesus meant that to apply to a Chancellor about to be consecrated Archbishop.
Perhaps then it's a touch of vanity.
A truly saintly man,
I know would never do all this in one day.
Let us call it the clumsy gesture of a spiritual gatecrasher.
Most clever, an Archbishop who gives all so dramatically to the people would be most popular with them.
Oh no, Folliot,
I'm simply enjoying all of this.
I'm beginning to believe he's not a sad God after all.
Forgive me, I fear my inexperienced methods will never meet with your approval.
I know that you cast the only vote against me.
In the end I gave way to the King's wishes.
I don't blame your reluctance as Bishop of London and senior churchman you should've been Archbishop.
Now to have to consecrate me instead and place the miter on my head.
I have no choice.
I'm only performing my function as Bishop.
I see you still wear the seal of the King's Chancellor.
Yes, I will continue to wear it, that and the
Archbishop's ring.
You do not find this inconsistent?
No, God is best served when the two rest side by side in harmony.
These excessive acts of humility will not compensate for subservience to the crown.
Thank you.
We are both aware of the delicacy of my position.
Let us trust that God will find a solution for it.
And now, since humility seems to be a little hard on the knees,
I trust you will be comfortable under our roof,
My Lord Bishop.
Dear Lord,
I wish there was something
I really regretted parting with so that I might offer it to you.
But forgive me, Lord, it's like going on a holiday,
I've never enjoyed myself so much in my whole life.
Lord, are you sure you're not laughing at me?
It all seems far too easy.
It is a Bishop's duty to pass judgment, to interpret, to consecrate, to ordain, to offer sacrifice, to baptize and to confirm.
Let us pray beloved Brother, let the goodness of Almighty God providing for the well-being of his church, may bestow upon this Bishop elect, the abundance of his grace through Christ our Lord,
Amen.
May these hands be anointed with hallowed oil, with the chrism that sanctifies.
Even as Samuel anointed David,
King and Prophet so may these hands be anointed and consecrated.
Take this ring, token of the pledged word.
Yours it is, donned with unshakable fidelity to preserve and guard, in unblemished honor
God's bride, the Holy Church.
Lord, on the head of this Bishop and champion of thine,
I put the helmet of defense and salvation that with forehead thus adorned, head armed with the horns of both testaments, he may appear fearsome to the enemies of truth.
His Grace, will receive you here.
It isn't every day that a Saxon monk has an audience with an Archbishop.
Open your eyes.
You'll kiss his ring and show respect to His Grace, or you'll get my foot on your backside.
You're welcome to Canterbury.
Kneel to His Grace.
I see our young Brother is quite unchanged.
Has he been troublesome to his Abbott?
Stubborn as a mule, My Lord.
Father Abbott tried kindness, but in the end had to have recourse to bread and water, even to the whip.
Nothing has any effect.
Except for a good kick in the rump if Your Grace will pardon the expression.
Stand up straight.
Pay attention to your Brother.
As a rule, the sin of pride stiffens a man's back.
Look me in the face.
Look me in the face.
Now, what do you have to say for yourself?
I see.
Now Brothers, we relieve you for the day from your rule of abstinence.
Go to our kitchen before you depart and I hope you'll do justice to our cuisine.
And this one?
We will keep him here with us.
He's vicious, Your Grace?
We are not afraid.
Well, now, wouldn't you rather have a Saxon Archbishop than a Norman one?
I hope I won't regret sending for you.
Why did you?
I'm not sure.
Perhaps in a young, intemperate way, yours is a voice that is good for me to hear.
Then why...
But please, not too often and not too loud Brother John.
You betrayed your Saxon race, now you betray God.
Perhaps you will succeed in teaching me humility, it's a virtue I've never really mastered.
Enter.
Your Grace, Bishop Folliot has just arrived from London, he wishes to speak to you urgently.
Well, My Lord
Bishop, what is it?
But, Your Grace?
You may speak freely,
Brother John is in our confidence.
What is it?
Your Grace, I have a most serious matter to report, which requires your immediate intervention.
Proceed.
A parish priest in
Lord Gilbert's domain, who is accused of debauching a young girl, has been seized by
His Lordships soldiers and dragged before the civil courts.
Is the priest guilty?
That is immaterial.
As a consecrated minister of God he can only be tried by our ecclesiastical courts.
You must demand his release into church custody immediately.
The principle is a vital one.
Does the King know of this?
He knows, but he turns a deaf ear.
Lord Gilbert is his friend.
I'm also a friend of King Henry's.
As Chancellor you are his friend.
But I wear the miter now.
You also wear the great seal of England and I warned you, you could never do so honorably.
It is fortunate that I do.
I will plead our case to the King.
I did not come here to ask you to plead a case.
I'm asking you to defend a principle and you'd better do so quickly, Your Grace.
Thank you for your warning.
We appreciate your efforts to chart the course you would naturally have followed had you become Archbishop.
At least, Your Grace,
I could never have been accused of divided loyalties.
Should I go now?
Can I go?
No.
See who's outside.
This is
Brother Philip, Your Grace.
He's come with a message for the Bishop of London.
I told him he just left but now he insists on seeing you.
Your Grace,
I wouldn't have dreamed of disturbing you but...
It's you who are disturbed, Brother Philip.
What is it?
I believe My Lord Bishop of London came to you to demand the custody of the accused priest.
Yes.
The priest is dead.
Dead?
Yes.
He tried to escape but Lord Gilbert's soldiers caught him and in the presence of his Lordship, killed him.
Thank you, Brother Philip, you may retire.
Leave us now, Brother John.
My Lord Jesus,
I find it difficult to talk to you.
What can I say?
I, who have turned away from you so often with indifference
I have been a stranger to prayer, undeserving of your friendship and your love.
I've been without honor and feel unworthy.
I am a weak and shallow creature, clever in only in the second rate and woridly arts seeking my comfort and pleasure.
I gave my love, such as it was elsewhere, putting service to my earthly king before my duty to you.
But now, they have made me the shepherd of your flock and guardian of your church.
Please, Lord, teach me now how to serve you with all my heart, to know at last what it really is to love, to adore.
So that I may worthily administer your kingdom here upon earth and find my true honor in observing your divine will.
Please, Lord, make me worthy.
You are a creature of extremes, aren't you, Brother John.
Get up.
Forgive me.
I didn't know,
I never realized.
Nor did I.
Get up.
You were very good at admonishing an Archbishop.
Do you think you could talk to a king?
Yes.
Good.
Then you will memorize what I write.
Henry?
Henry?
What is it mother?
Why do you keep gazing out of the window?
Becket won't come you know, he's much too busy giving money to the poor and fitting sandals on beggars.
I never liked him as an adventurer, but now that he puts on the airs of a saint, he certainly keeps himself in splendid isolation since you made him Archbishop.
He's in retreat.
It's part of the ritual.
Anyway, I don't need to be reassured by his presence.
He's my friend.
More is the pity.
He has a strange way of showing gratitude.
Your friend, you mean you went to the whorehouses together.
It was he who lured you away from the duties you owed to me.
Madam, in matters of debauchery it was I who lured him and I didn't need anyone to lure me away from the duties I owe you.
I made you four children very conscientiously, thank the Lord my duty is done.
I pray heaven he stays away from you.
When you realize how he has used you, you may appreciate the joys of family life again.
The joys of family life are limited, madam, to be perfectly frank, you bore me, you and your everlasting backbiting.
Stop this.
And this eternal tatting of yours.
In God's name how long does it take to make a tapestry and it's mediocre beyond belief.
One performs according to one's gifts.
Yes.
Shut up, the lot of you!
Which one are you?
Henry the III.
Not yet, sir, number two is in the best of health.
A fine way you bring up your children, madam.
Do you see yourself as regent already?
No wonder I shun your bed, it's not amusing to make love to one's own widow.
Who's that?
A messenger from Canterbury if you can spare the time from bullying your children.
Messenger?
Is your master ill?
No, Your Highness,
I have a message from His Grace.
A message?
These are Becket's words.
"Whereas men at arms of the Lord Gilbert under his orders and in his presence have seized and killed a priest of the church,
I Becket,
Archbishop of Canterbury,
Primate of England, do now ask that Your Highness in accordance with the law of the Realm apprehend Lord Gilbert and charge him with the crime of murder."
Well, my son, now you have heard from your friend.
Get out!
Get out, both of you!
Take your royal vermin with you!
Your Highness, is there a reply for the Archbishop?
Your Grace.
Yes?
The King is here.
Are you certain?
He came mounted and alone, but I'm sure it's he.
My Prince.
Why did you send a messenger?
Canterbury's only five hours from London.
I've just ridden it in four,
I'm frozen stiff.
Would you like some wine?
No.
Give me a reason.
Why did you send a messenger?
What answer did you give him?
You've arrived here before he has.
I detect ill, devious Becket here.
What game are you playing, Thomas?
No game, My Prince.
Lord Gilbert murdered a priest.
I want the guilty punished.
The guilty of what?
This priest was a scandal to his parish.
That was never proved.
Gilbert should've handed the accused over to the church for process of law.
If guilty, we would have determined his punishment.
I am the law.
Gilbert will recourse to me,
I gave him leave to arrest this priest.
I can't allow any of my clergy to be thrown into prison and tried by the civil authorities.
Neither can I stand by and let my priests be murdered.
You?
You can't allow?
You can't stand by?
Are you taking yourself seriously as Archbishop?
I am the
Archbishop, My Prince.
By my grace.
Are you demented, you're Chancellor of England, you're mine.
I'm also the Archbishop and you have introduced me to deeper obligations.
And if I won't charge Gilbert?
I can't force you, but there is always a final judgment beyond the King's justice.
Oh that, Lord Gilbert will face his fate on the day of judgment, as we all will.
I'm sure he'll have a great deal more to answer for than killing a felonious priest.
Lord Gilbert will come to that judgment already damned, Sire.
I intend to excommunicate him.
You are demented.
Don't you understand that when you attack my nobles, you attack me, and when you attack me, you attack England!
There is more to
England than the crown.
You must learn to face that eventually, My Prince.
Damn you, don't lecture me!
You once told me you didn't know what honor was, and I laughed at you.
But now to betray me, to challenge my power.
I do not seek power, My Prince.
It is only that
I finally discovered a real honor to defend.
Whose honor?
Whose honor is greater than the King's?
The honor of God.
Forgive me.
Hmm, you give the lions of England back to me, like a little boy who doesn't want to play anymore.
I would have gone to war with all England's might behind me and even against
England's interest to defend you, Thomas.
I would have given away my life laughingly for you, only I loved you and you didn't love me that's the difference.
Stay away.
But thank you for this last gift as you desert me.
Now I shall learn to be alone.
Bishop.
What do you want, Philip?
Your Majesty, alone without an escort?
The King nevertheless.
Bishop, I wish to confess.
The King has his own confessor.
It is an important court prerogative.
Don't be nervous, Bishop.
I'm not asking for absolution.
I have something far worse than a sin on my conscience.
A mistake, a crass mistake.
I ordered you to vote for Becket in the election at Canterbury.
I repent of it.
I bowed beneath the royal hand.
Very reluctantly, I know.
I'm told this compromise with your conscience made you seriously ill afterwards.
God cured me.
Very good of him.
You wear his uniform and have his ear.
He's let me fall ill without lifting a finger and I must cure myself.
I did not know of this...
I have the
Archbishop on my stomach, a big, hard lump
I shall have to vomit back.
I think you are a man one can talk to, Bishop.
I believe I misjudged you, friendship blinded me.
Is the King's friendship for Thomas Becket dead, Your Highness?
Yes, Bishop, it died quite suddenly, a sort of heart failure.
A curious phenomenon,
Your Highness, but quite frequent.
I hate Becket now.
I hate him, as much as you are jealous of him.
He's like an animal tearing my guts,
I can't bear it anymore.
I shall have to turn it loose on him.
But I am the King and my office stands in my way.
I need someone to help me.
My only interest is for the church.
Oh, come, Bishop.
We're alone and the church is empty.
The church is never empty.
The little red lamp burns in the chapel signifying God's presence in the tabernacle.
Do you take me for one of your sheep, Holy Pastor?
I like playing games, but only with boys of my own age.
The one for whom that little red lamp burns has seen into your innermost heart and mine a long time ago.
Of my hatred of Thomas Becket and your envy of him, he knows all there is to know.
Strange, I'd always taken Your Highness, for a perennial adolescent who cared only for his pleasures.
One can be wrong about people, Bishop,
I made the same mistake.
Now, if it could be proved that Becket had committed some gross impropriety as Chancellor, say embezzlement, what would the church do?
If that were established,
I say if, the Bishops could legally dissolve their allegiance to him pending their report to the pope.
And beyond that?
You, you would go beyond that?
The whole way.
In his guilt, if he were found guilty, he would then be charged under canon law.
And the penalty?
That would be for
Your Majesty to decide.
Thomas.
You love him don't you?
You still love him.
That impostor, that Saxon guttersnipe, that mitered hog.
Hold your tongue, Priest.
All I confided to you was my hate, not my love.
For England's sake, you'll help me get rid of him, but don't ever insult him to my face.
He will be accused, and you will play your proper part.
According to law.
I would spit, if I were not in God's house.
My Brothers, as you have been told your presence here is voluntary.
If any of you have second thoughts you may retire now.
Thank you for attending.
Good day, My Lords.
I did not expect to see you at Canterbury.
Do you still disagree with my decision?
Your Grace, can nothing persuade you to delay?
Oh, yes, the King's arrest of Lord Gilbert on the charge of sacrilegious murder.
There will be an arrest but not Lord Gilbert's.
The sheriff of London is waiting in the sacristy.
He has orders to summon you before the King's grand justicer, the instant you pronounce the excommunication.
How curious, on what charge?
Embezzlement.
The King finds that there are large sums of money missing from the treasury during your administration as Chancellor?
How much?
Forty thousand pounds in fine gold.
There was never that much gold in the whole treasury.
I beg of you do not do this.
You will strike a blow that will split church and state for a generation.
If I do not strike it now the church as we know it will not survive a generation.
God will see that it survives.
No, the Kingdom of
God must be defended like any other Kingdom.
Gentlemen, it is a supreme irony that the woridly Becket, the profligate and libertine should find himself standing here at this moment.
But here he is in spite of himself.
But the King for good or ill, chose to pass the burden of the church onto me and now I must carry it.
I've rolled up my sleeves, and taken the church on my back.
Nothing will ever make me set it down again.
Now, Lords, if you will forgive me.
Lord Gilbert,
Baron of England, by the grace of His Majesty,
King Henry the II, seized upon the person of a priest of the holy church and unlawfully did hold him in custody.
Furthermore, in the presence of Lord Gilbert and by his command, his men seized upon this priest when he tried to escape and put him to death.
This is the sin of murder and sacrilege.
In that,
Lord Gilbert has rendered no act of contrition or repentance and is at the moment at liberty in the land, we do here and now separate him from the precious body and blood of Christ and from the society of all Christians.
We exclude him from our Holy Mother Church and all her sacraments in heaven, or on earth.
We declare him excommunicate and anathema.
We cast him into the outer darkness, we judge him damned with the devil and his fallen angels and all the reprobate to eternal fire and everlasting pain.
So be it.
As the Lord
Sheriff of London,
I'm commanded to summon you,
Thomas Becket, to the King's court on the charges herein set forth, stamped with the King's seal.
I Robert de Beaumont,
Duke of Leicester,
Grand Justicer of the Realm, do now summon Thomas Becket to this court of law, for the third and last time.
Thomas Becket, step forward.
He's doomed, isn't he?
Yes.
At last.
I forbid you to gloat.
At seeing your enemy perish.
Why not?
Becket is my enemy but in the human balance traitor that he is and naked as his mother made him, he's worth 100 of you madam, with your crown and your jewels and your august uncle the emperor into the bargain.
I'm forced to fight him now and crush him but at least he gave me with open hands everything that is at all good in me, and you have never given me anything but your coping mediocrity and your everlasting obsession with your puny little person and what you thought was due to it!
That's why
I forbid you to smile while Becket is being destroyed!
I gave you my youth,
I gave you your children.
I don't like my children!
And as for your youth, that withered flower pressed between the pages of a hymn book since you were 12 years old with its watery blood and stale insipid scent, you can bid farewell to that without a tear.
Your body was an empty desert, Madame, which duty forced me to wander in alone.
But you have never been a wife to me, and Becket was my friend, red blooded, generous and full of strength.
Oh, my Thomas.
And I?
I have given you nothing I suppose?
Life, yes.
Thank you.
But after that
I never saw you except in a passageway on your way to a ball, or in your crown and ermine mantle
10 minutes before official ceremonies when you were forced to tolerate my presence.
No! No one on this earth has ever loved me except Becket!
Call him back then, absolve him if he loves you, give him back his power, but do something.
I am.
I'm learning to be alone.
By the authority granted me,
I, Robert de Beaumont, servant of the crown, do now before this council, charge Thomas Becket with the crimes of...
Robert.
I charge you, Thomas Becket...
Robert de Beaumont, hear me for the sake of your soul, which is in the gravest danger.
All in this assembly know how faithfully I've served My Lord the King.
It was he who willed that I be Archbishop and it was for love of him alone that I accepted.
I am innocent of any wrongdoing in my administration of the King's treasury as Chancellor, or at any other time.
I therefore refuse to plea to these trumped up charges.
I will be judged by the Pope alone, to whom before you all
I now appeal and place myself and my church under his protection.
As head of the
Church of England and as your spiritual father,
I forbid you to pass judgment on me.
I command you and all who would charge me to hold your peace on pain of endangering your immortal souls.
Well played, Thomas.
Do you think you can carry this off indefinitely you fool?
We are all God's fools, My Lord.
Becket, you are a liar!
You are a traitor!
Sheathe your sword Morville before you impale your soul upon it!
It's funny, it's too funny.
He's made mincemeat of them.
I'm surrounded by fools!
Becket is the only intelligent man in my kingdom and he's against me!
Your Highness, it was impossible...
Shut up, get to your feet.
Did you hear him, he appeals to the Pope.
If he gains the
Pope's ear, Bishop, we may find the entire kingdom under Papal interdict.
I could be excommunicated myself.
But, Your Highness,
I do not think that...
I want no more thinking!
Becket must not cross the channel.
King Louis of France would be the first to help him get to the Pope.
The Archbishop must not leave England, see to it.
From now on, Bishop, it is total war.
Psssst...
My French Knight takes your English Bishop.
Your Majesty's adroit.
Pardon, Sire.
To snug.
Why do all tailors want to strangle one's armpits?
Your Majesty, the English ambassador's extraordinary insist that I convey their compliments.
They've already done that.
I'll see them when I'm ready, that's my job.
They wish respectfully Sire, to call your attention to the fact that they have been waiting for three days.
Let them wait, that's their job.
Ambassadors are paid to pace about in anterooms especially in these times of uneasy peace.
But they have an urgent communication from Henry of England, Sire.
The King of England and his ambassadors can drown themselves in what they are impertinent enough to call their English channel.
But, Your Majesty, the extradition of a criminal is a courtesy due from one crowned head to another.
My dear man, crowned heads are free to play a little game of courtesy, but nations owe one another none.
Oh.
All right, show them in, show them in.
No, you may stay.
The ambassadors can share our attention with our tailor.
It will demonstrate to the English that exact social status of our court.
May I be permitted to present to, Your Majesty, the two envoys extraordinary from His Highness,
Henry of England,
His Grace, the Bishop of London and Robert de Beaumont,
Duke of Leicester.
Welcome My Lords.
Fresh from England?
How is our good King Henry?
He was well, Your Majesty, when we left him two weeks ago.
Two weeks to cross the channel, gentlemen?
We have been waiting upon
Your Majesty, for three days.
Why was I not informed?
Girot.
Your Majesty?
See what I have to contend with.
But perhaps I can make it up to you.
Would you permit me to furnish you with some French garments made by our craftsmen here, it will only take two weeks?
We thank, Your Majesty, but we have urgent business in Rome.
Too bad.
Well, is there anything else I can do for you?
I wish to deliver a message from Henry, King of England to his friend Louis,
King of the French.
We are all ears.
He wishes you to know...
Oh, just one moment.
Yes, do continue.
He wishes you to know that Thomas Becket,
Archbishop of Canterbury, has been found guilty of treason and has forthwith fled his kingdom.
He therefore entreats you not to allow this criminal to reside within your territories, nor to permit any of your vassals to give counsel or support to him.
He solemnly declares that your enemies would receive none from him, nor from his subjects.
Henry, King of England,
Duke of Normandy.
Gentlemen, we have listened most attentively to your sovereign's gracious request, and we shall shortly be drafting a formal reply to it.
In the meantime, however, we can only express our astonishment.
No news has reached us of the Archbishop of Canterbury's presence in our domains.
But Sire, we have word that he is in your domains.
He's taken refuge in the Abbey of San Martin
My Lord Bishop, we flatter ourselves there is some order in our kingdom.
If he were there, we should most certainly had been informed.
Bring in Thomas Becket.
Rise, Thomas Becket, and greet us as the
Primate of England.
The bow would've been enough and if I know my etiquette you were entitled to a slight nod of the head from me.
That's done.
I might also be required to kiss the ring if this visit were an official one but I am under the impression that isn't.
No, Sire.
I'm on an exile.
That too is an important title in France.
I'm told you are a dangerous one.
I'm afraid so, Sire.
How delightful, shall we discuss it in private.
We enjoy danger Becket, it keeps us alive.
Do you value candor?
I do, Sire.
Then let me tell you that were you a French official
I might have kept you into prison myself.
For the moment, however, we are pleased to grant you our royal protection.
I humbly thank you, Your Majesty, but I'm bound to tell you that I cannot buy your favor with any act hostile to my country.
You do us an injustice, that was understood.
I believe that in the past however, you have been no stranger to the art of political maneuver.
That is true, Sire.
Well, speaking frankly, you suit our purpose in our chess game.
England is splitting into the Henry camp and the Becket camp and that suits us admittible.
We ask nothing further of you, but, there is always a but, as I'm sure you are aware?
I am aware.
I am responsible only for
France's interest, Becket.
Unfortunately, I cannot afford to shoulder those of heaven as well.
For the moment it suits me to shelter any fugitive from Henry's court.
His recent impertinence in claiming and capturing some of our frontier towns must be well known to you, Thomas, since you more than distinguished yourself in several of these engagements?
In a month or so, however, my dealings with Henry may require a different tactic.
I might even be obliged to ask you to leave France.
I hope to have a solution to such a dilemma.
Oh?
I intend to go onto Rome to put my case before the Holy Father, if you will give me safe conduct.
You shall have it, of course, you're the ideal guest.
But might I be permitted to give you a word of advice.
I would appreciate it.
The Pope is a most holy man, but like so many lofty personages he is surrounded by men of a somewhat inferior stamp.
They need money and King Henry might be willing to provide it.
Keep your eyes open.
I will.
But permit me to show you my aviary.
That man Becket smacks of too much sincerity.
A practice that is most disconcerting.
Fiddlesticks.
Sincerity is a form of strategy just like any other.
In a pinch I have been known to use it myself.
The trouble is, if your opponent starts being sincere at the same time you do, then the game becomes horribly confusing.
Shh.
I assure you, Your Holiness, it's a simple matter.
No, no, no, Zambelli,
I don't agree, it is impossible.
If we take the money from King Henry,
I cannot possibly receive Becket.
Receive the money from the King, very Holy Father, and receive the
Archbishop too.
The one will neutralize the other.
You know what they say,
Becket is going to ask me?
No, Holy Father.
Zambelli, don't play the fox with me.
It was you who told me.
I beg your pardon,
Holy Father.
I had forgotten, or rather as Your Holiness asked me the question
I thought you had forgotten and so I took a chance and...
Zambelli, if you start out maneuvering yourself to no purpose, we'll be here all night.
Well, bring him in.
His Holiness will receive you now.
I'm sorry to be importunate, Your Holiness, but time is running out and my course concerns the very life of the church in England.
I know, I know, and your cause is worthy but nevertheless, Becket, the church must seek to exist peacefully within the framework of the state.
I sought that with desperation, Your Holiness.
Precisely, Becket.
You are new to God's service and perhaps for that reason you were somewhat hot headed and intemperate in your methods.
You have proved your moral worth, but you have also split the church in England into two parties and that is regrettable.
Holy Father, I fear this may be true and it has given me much agony.
If I'm guilty, if my judgment was wrong, then I am most sincerely repentant. unfortunately that doesn't solve the problem.
Holy Father, relieve me of the title of Archbishop, let me be an ordinary priest.
All right, done.
Zambelli.
Why do your request this?
Then, Your Holiness, could make a free and open decision.
The protection of my position as head of the English church may prove an embarrassment
I would like to relive you of.
No, that would mean our total surrender to the state.
You will maintain your status as Archbishop but you will, for the present, maintain it in a monastic retreat.
Where do you wish us to send you?
To the Abbey of
San Martin in France.
I ask only that my former servant,
Brother John be allowed to accompany me.
Of course,
God grant you peace, Thomas Becket.
That man is obviously an abyss of ambition.
How long a retreat?
A very long retreat.
I wouldn't count on it.
Wait till he tastes the food at the monastery.
You look concerned,
Your Grace?
Is something wrong?
No, Brother John.
You are unhappy here?
No, perhaps I'm too happy.
Can I help?
No, only God can help.
Lord, what do you really want me to do?
To remain here, a poor monk in simplicity of spirit, is it a path to bring me nearer to you?
Or is to easy a way, perhaps even a luxury?
The path to holiness in this monastery is too effortless.
I think it would be too easy to buy you like this.
Bargain price.
It has pleased you to make me Archbishop and to set me like a solitary pawn face to face with the
King on the chessboard.
I think you mean me to defend your honor, peacefully if I can with argument and with compromise and if I cannot then with the full challenge of my office and the soaring force of what I know to be right.
So,
I shall take up the miter again and the golden cope and the great silver cross and I shall go back and fight with the weapons it has pleased you to give me.
All the rest, thy will be done.
Look, Thomas, your King awaits you.
I'm glad you weren't born on this side of the channel, Thomas, you'd have been a thorn in my side too.
How did you bewitch me into doing this for you?
I convinced you that if the King and I reconciled he will be placed in your debt.
True.
Why does he hate you so?
He's never forgiven me for preferring God to him.
Go, Thomas.
You know, it's a strange thing but Becket's safety has become quite dear to me.
You look older, Thomas.
So do you, My Prince.
Are you cold?
I'm frozen stiff, chilblains are killing me.
You love it of course, you're in your element, aren't you, just that Monk's habit.
I always told you one must fight the cold with the cold's weapons.
Strip yourself naked every morning and... splash yourself with cold water.
I used to, when you were there to make me.
I never wash now, I stink.
How's your son? he must have come of age.
He's an idiot and sly like his mother.
Thomas, don't you ever marry.
You took that matter out of my hands when you had me ordained.
If we start on that we're sure to quarrel.
Talk about something else.
Very well.
Has Your Majesty done much hunting lately?
Yes, every day.
It doesn't amuse me anymore.
Becket, I'm bored.
My Prince,
I wish I could help you.
What are you waiting for?
For the honor of God and the honor of the
King to become one.
That may take long.
Yes, that may take long.
I'm the King, Thomas, and so long as we are on this earth, you owe me the first move.
I'm prepared to forget a lot of things but not the fact that I am King.
You yourself taught me that.
Never forget it, My Prince, you have a different task to do, you have to steer the ship.
And you, what do you have to do?
To resist you with all my might when you steer against the Lord God.
What do you expect of me then?
Are you hoping I'll weaken?
No.
I'm afraid we must only do absurdly, what it has been given to us to do right to the end.
Look suppose we come down to earth and use words that make sense to a bore like myself otherwise we'll never get anywhere.
And there'll be two frozen statutes trying to make their peace in a frozen eternity.
My Lord, I was doing my best to make you understand.
I'm an idiot then, talk to me like an idiot.
Will you lift the excommunication you pronounced on Lord Gilbert?
No, because it's the only weapon I have left to defend what was given into my care.
Will you agree to the ten proposals which the Bishop's accepted in your absence, particularly, to the surrender of priests who seek the protection of the church to escape my courts of justice?
No.
My role is to defend my sheep and they are my sheep.
But I shall agree to the nine other articles in the spirit of peace and because I know you must remain King in all and of all, save the honor of God.
All right,
I will give way on this one point in memory of our past friendship.
You may return to England.
Thank you, My Prince.
I meant to go back in any case and give myself up to your power.
For in all things that concern this earth,
I owe you obedience.
We're finished now, and I'm cold.
I feel cold too, now.
You never loved me did you, Thomas?
In so far as
I was capable of love, yes, I did.
Did you start to love God?
You mule!
Answer a simple question!
Yes.
I started to love the honor of God.
I should never have seen you.
It hurts too much.
My Prince.
No, no pity, it's dirty.
This is the last time
I shall come begging to you.
Go back to England.
Farewell, My Prince.
I sail tomorrow.
I know that I shall never see you again.
How dare you say that to me when I've given you my royal word.
Do you take me for a traitor?
Thomas!
Sit.
Come here you.
Sit here.
You look to me, sir, not your mother.
Sit, you witless baboon.
What is the meaning of this?
Henry, what are you doing?
I know very well what I'm doing madam.
Out.
Before you fill your bellies, we have something to announce.
Reviving an ancient custom, we have decided to have our successor crowned in our lifetime.
We do this to protect the kingdom from future pretenders to the throne.
Henry, this...
Shut up.
Stop dribbling while
I raise you to glory.
To my successor,
Henry the III.
Henry the III.
When will the coronation take place?
As soon as we arrive in England.
Where, may I ask?
You may well ask.
At York.
Not at Canterbury?
My good mother, gentlemen, is hinting with her customary delicacy that there is a double purpose to this mummery.
There is.
We are going to show our freshly reinstated Archbishop that we can still do without him.
A coronation of the English King is the most jealously guarded privilege of Canterbury.
I'd give anything to see Becket's face when he learns he's lost it, and that York has got it.
That will fix him.
Get out of there, you young cretin, you're not crowned yet.
What a look.
Filial devotion is a beautiful thing.
You'd like to be the real king, wouldn't you, you little pig.
With that number three after your name and papa good and stiff in his tomb.
Well, you'll have to wait a bit.
Papa is well, papa is very well indeed.
My son, you know
I've always been against any reconciliation with that wretch Becket.
You know I understand your hatred for him, but do not let it lead you into an action, which you may bitterly regret.
This boy is not clever ambitious men will use him against you long before you cease to reign.
I'm still very much alive, madam, and in control.
Henry, for all our sakes, think of England and not of your disappointed love for this man.
Love?
Love?
A moment ago it was hate.
And what gives you the right madam to meddle in my loves and hates?
You have an obsession about him, which is unhealthy and unnatural, and now that he no longer gives you comfort...
Oh, God.
If Thomas Becket were a faithless woman, you'd behave no differently.
Sweet Jesus, you tear him out of your heart.
Oh, if I were a man.
Thank God, madam, he gave you breasts.
An asset from which I derived not the slightest benefit.
I was let out to be suckled by a peasant girl.
That no doubt is why it is so difficult to see the king beneath your crown.
So you have something to add my lady.
Well go on, add it, add it, get it out of you, once and for all in one great whine.
Let's hear the poison you've accumulated.
I pity you.
I tolerated your mistresses, sir, but do you expect me to tolerate everything?
Becket!
Always Becket!
I am a woman,
I am your wife,
I am a Queen!
I'll complain to my father!
I'll complain to my uncle the Emperor!
I'll complain to all the Kings of Europe!
I'll complain to God!
If I were you, madam,
I'd start with God!
Go to your chapel and see if he's at home!
Get out the pack of you.
I wretch with boredom at the sight of you!
To the devil, with my whole family if he'll have you!
And as for you, young Henry the III, here's my royal foot up your royal buttocks!
Ah, that's better.
Let us drink, gentlemen.
Let us drink, till we roll under the table in vomit and oblivion.
My faithful hounds.
It's warm beside you, like beasts in a stable.
Good sweat.
Comfortable nothingness.
Not the least glimmer inside to spoil the fun.
And to think before
I met Becket I was like you, a well oiled machine, for belching, whoring and punching heads.
What did you put in mine, Thomas,
That stopped the machine?
Tell me, do you ever think?
Never, Sire, a gentleman has better things to do.
Here, drink up.
What's the news from England?
Has Becket landed?
He has landed, Sire.
Was no one there to receive him,
Lord Gilbert for example?
Oh, he was there, damned and excommunicated as he still is.
But there were seven bishops there charging his soldiers not to cause bloodshed and give the light of the safe conduct you gave Becket.
Yes,
I gave him safe conduct.
The peasants escorted him from village to village.
They cheered him all the way to Canterbury.
Not a single gentleman, not a single Norman showed his face.
Only Saxons?
Yes.
Swarms of them.
Becket left
England a fugitive, an exile.
He's returned there to find an affection that people have always saved for their king.
A man who ate my bread.
A man I raised from nothing.
A man I loved.
Yes,
I loved him.
I loved him, and I still do.
Enough, oh God, enough.
Stop.
Stop.
I can do nothing,
I'm as useless as a woman.
So long as he's alive,
I tremble,
I shake.
I'm the king, and yet I shake.
Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?
A priest who mocks me.
Are all around me cowards, like myself?
Are there no men left in England.
It's my heart.
It's too fast, too fast, it's too...
Thomas.
Make haste.
It's difficult with all these little laces, it warrants a woman's hands.
A man's hands are better today.
What's worth doing, is worth doing well.
Yes.
If it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.
Do up all the laces, every one of them.
I must look my best today.
God will give us time.
There, that's done.
But I just as soon had cleaned out our pigsty at home, it's not half so much hard work.
Are you fond of your pig?
Yes, I was.
At my father's house we had some pigs too when I was a child.
Did you now?
Will it... be today?
It's possible, my son.
Are you afraid?
Oh, no, not if I have time to fight.
All I want is the chance to strike a few blows first, so I shan't have done nothing but receive them all my life.
If I can kill one
Norman first, just one, that'll seem fair and right enough to me.
Are you so set in killing one?
Yes, I am.
I don't mind if I am just a grain of sand in a machine because I know by putting more and more grains of sand in a machine, one day it'll come grinding to a stop.
And on that day, what then?
Well, we'll have a fine, new, well oiled machine in place of the old one, and this time we'll put the Normans into it instead.
That's what justice means, doesn't it?
Now give me my silver cross,
I must hold it.
My Lord, it's heavy.
A good swipe with this and they'd feel it.
Lucky little Saxon, for you that would settle all accounts in this black worid, wouldn't it?
There Lord,
I am ready, adorned for your festivities.
Come, let us go to the altar.
Your Grace.
Your Grace.
There are armed men at the doors.
I bolted the doors but...
It's time for vespers.
Does one bolt the doors during vespers,
I've never heard of it?
But Your Grace?
Open them.
Everything must be as it should be for divine service.
It is here now, the supreme folly, this is its hour.
One does not carry arms into God's house.
What do you want?
Your death.
We will continue with the service.
Saxon!
Dog!
Traitor!
Oh Lord, how heavy thy honor is to bear.
Poor, Henry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yes, yes, it was all agreed.
I forgive you, pigs.
Saxon pigs.
They certainly wanted their money's worth.
Is there a large crowd outside?
Yes, Sire.
There's nothing more certain to win them over than the sight of a king doing penance and humbling himself under the lash.
The honor of God, gentlemen, is a very good thing and all things considered one gains by having it on one's side.
Thomas Becket our friend, always used to say so.
Tonight in council, we will determine what punishment his murderers should receive.
Sire, they are unknown.
Our justice will seek them out, you may be sure.
It is a time my dear Barons, for all of us to do penance.
Hear me!
People of Canterbury and citizens of England.
As I have submitted myself to the lash, so have I petitioned the Pope.
And this day,
I have received his answer.
Thomas Becket, former Archbishop of Canterbury and martyr to the cause of God and his church shall henceforth be honored and prayed to in this kingdom as a saint.
Is the honor of God washed clean enough?
Are you satisfied now, Thomas?
In 1859, a Swedish army lieutenant,
Count Sixten Sparre... and a Danish tightrope walker,
Elvira Madigan, alias Hedvig Jensen... shot themseIves in a forest in Denmark.
This film is their story.
What is it, Sixten?
A bee! Got me in the behind!
I won't be able to sit down, ever!
Never in my whole life!
Come, let me blow on it.
Captain! First troop, as ordered!
Captain, second troop, as ordered!
Where is Lieutenant Sparre?
Are you happy?
Are you happy?
I'm happy, Sixten.
I'm so happy.
I can hardly believe that I dared to escape.
I was always brave on the wire, but nothing but a coward on the ground.
Where the hell's Elvira?
Without her, they'll want their money back.
Let them search for me.
Even I hardly recognize myself.
Stop that!
Hold the mirror for me.
Call me Hedvig.
That's my real name.
Dear, sweet Hedvig.
See the bear?
Like those trick pictures.
- Not a bear. It's a rabbit.
- It's a bear. Can't you see?
- Rabbit!
- Bear!
Rabbit.
What is it?
Feel for yourself.
Just imagine it: News report--
"Missing: Lieutenant Sixten Sparre.
Description: Half a beard.
Has never been seen sitting down, and never will."
Do you love me?
You gave me back my name.
Before you, I had to be both Hedvig and Elvira.
I know who I am now.
First, we have to buy civilian buttons for your jacket.
How much money do we have?
Don't worry. We'll manage.
- How much?
- Eighteen million... and 11 farthings.
A gift.
You have more use for it.
- How elegant.
- You see, I'm a civilian now.
Thank you so much.
It looks expensive.
Can we afford it, Sixten?
What a nice coupIe.
Think they'll stay at our hotel?
I think I saw them in the woods... but the man had a beard and golden buttons, so it can't be them.
Do you like it?
I can't sleep with that in the room.
What can we do about it?
Have you seen this, Sixten?
- Who drew it?
- A cripple. He never said his name.
He drew me while I was sitting in a cafe in Paris.
- May I borrow a needle and thread?
- Black?
- Are you the cook at this hotel?
- I cook and clean and do everything.
You're a busy woman.
I certainly don't sleep all day long.
- Let me try. May I?
- Yes.
Let me show you how you do it.
No, wait.
I have another ball of wool here.
Cast on and try again.
I've never sewn on a button before.
You could support us as a tailor.
If you fall, well, you can't do anything about it.
I did once, but I was lucky.
In Venice.
I danced on a wire over the canal.
An orchestra played on a raft in the lagoon.
By the light of burning torches.
Oh, I love Italy!
You ask if I'm happy?
Sometimes I ask myself if I deserve to be this happy.
What we're doing is perhaps not allowed yet.
But one day people will be able to choose more than one way to live.
PeopIe will dare to admit that they change.
Have you ever seen war, Sixten?
You're a soldier, but you know nothing about your job.
War is a soldier's job, right?
Our circus tent burned down in Paris.
It was hit by a grenade.
I was only two, but they told me about it. It was in '71.
All our animals died in the fire.
I can remember the smell.
War is not for fancy parades, Sixten.
It's the smell of burnt flesh.
Nothing is sacred nowadays.
Nothing.
"Sporrong, StockhoIm."
Where did you get it?
In the forest.
"When John arrived in Stockholm, he borrowed money for rent.
Always extremely sensitive... he wanted to live where he used to watch the workers' parades."
- Have you seen the clothesline?
- No.
"We are speaking of our circus princess, Elvira Madigan.
The circus came to town... and performed at Rullan's arena.
Right away, everybody Ioved Miss Elvira.
They loved her more and more with each performance.
But one day she disappeared without a trace.
In their sorrow, her parents... tried to hide the fact that she had run away."
Let me see.
"It was clear, as soon as one saw her... that she was a highly strung, sensitive creature.
With her silky, golden hair flying... she looked more like a spiritual vision than human flesh and blood.
A strange fire lived in her eyes... and a cold smile seemed always to play on her lips... despite the ardent enthusiasm of her admirers."
Excuse me.
"Missing:
Elvira Madigan, Sixten Sparre."
I didn't recognize you at first.
Our guests will be so excited... when they hear that Elvira Madigan is staying here.
I think Larsen has baked a cake.
Let me go and tell him--
No, please!
Look. Look who's missing.
- What do you mean?
- The scarecrow, the gold buttons.
It has to be them-- Sparre and Madigan.
I'm going to report them.
- What'll they do to him?
- As a deserter, prison.
Whistle.
I can't whistle, Sixten.
Miss Elvira, they know who you are.
I just saw Madsen.
He has a horse for you.
- You must pack right away.
- Hurry, Sixten.
You forgot your knitting.
You'll need a sweater come autumn.
I've got one!
Easy! Easy!
Where's the fish?
Did we lose it?
It's here!
We have food, Hedvig.
Food! We have food!
Find a good place for a fire while I gather sticks.
I have to clean the fish.
So I finally found you after a week of looking.
I've been searching for you for a week.
Nobody knows I'm here.
- Not even--
- Not even Henrietta.
- How are my children?
- Christian had whooping cough... and Louise has lost a tooth.
- Where?
- Right here. She's so proud.
Now she can spit with her mouth closed.
She always envied her brother that skill.
This is the fellow I know.
No, it isn't.
I'm on the women's side now.
Unravelling wool.
Lying in the grass.
I know about lying in the grass.
If you look at a blade of grass that's close to your eye... that blade is clear but nothing else is.
Everything else is blurred.
We have to make choices, Sixten.
I believe one blade of grass can be the entire world.
And the world is nothing without grass.
We have to start somewhere.
Start with something that is real.
Words have lost their meaning for me lately... and other things have come to life instead.
Our royal parades-- the horses' hooves, the drums, the shining, sparkling bayonets.
Do you know how many layers of skin a bayonet has to go through... before it reaches your guts?
I looked it up in a medical book.
Epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous layer.. a thin layer of fat, then the fascia.
Know what that is?
It's like a skin which covers and protects the muscles.
Then the muscles. Through it all before you reach the guts.
You have to know it layer by layer.
You have to see things up close.
She's distorted your vision.
Yes, I agree. She has.
But isn't that what love is?
To borrow another person's eyes... to-to experience the world... as your beloved sees and feels it?
Isn't that what love is?
What a fellow!
Taking a carton of eggs to the opera.
Incredible!
- What's his favorite aria?
- The egg aria.
- What did he do with the eggs?
- Who?
- Lauritzen.
- He ate them.
Shall we say it's me who's on duty?
You're shivering.
I'll get your coat.
What shall we say to each other?
You did that very skillfully, but can you really afford it?
There are times when you don't question the cost.
Are you happy?
I know someone who is unhappy--
- One, two, three, actually.
- I know Sixten has two children.
But I don't know anything about them.
Don't you ever think of the ones he left because of you?
What gives you the right?
- I need him too.
- What you need is a male admirer.
In your profession I'm sure you have many opportunities.
He's not the first, that's true, but he's the best.
So far.
There will be others.
No. He's the last for me.
It's not just about people.
He's betrayed his country too.
My mother is German, my father Danish.
My stepfather is American.
I have friends in France and Italy.
Look. My hand is like a map.
Here are the lines, like borders.
What does it matter where the lines are?
I care about the hand-- the whole hand.
There aren't any cigars left.
Remember Axelson's trousers?
His pipe went round and round.
It was a fine summer. I remember because Christian wasn't well.
I looked in on him every morning.
The sun shone through Henrietta's lace curtains-- BeIgian lace-- and made patterns on Christian's bed.
I have to tell you something-- something difficult.
Henrietta tried to kill herself.
She tried to drown herself.
After she'd put the children to bed--
Did you know she was there?
Did you lie about Henrietta?
Then you're no longer my friend!
He was lying. He lied about Henrietta.
You must come back.
Hedvig. Hedvig my love, look at me!
"To Father from Louise"
I'm going for a walk.
Can I help in some way?
Can I help in some way?
No, sir.
It's not your kind of work.
It's not even a painting.
What does it say?
"T.L.," I think.
I can't remember his name.
He sketched me in a cafe in Paris.
He was a cripple.
A cripple's work isn't worth much.
How about two crowns?
I bought some cream for the raspberries.
Look how thick it is.
- Did you buy some wool as well?
- Yes. I had enough for some wool.
It'll do the front and one sleeve.
Then there's only one sleeve left to do, and I've money left over.
"Performing Artists Wanted
For Annual Craftsmen's Fair."
- Can I help you, Miss?
- You're looking for performers.
What is it you do?
- I'm a tightrope walker.
- We don't need that.
But we have a good floor.
Can you dance on it?
Show me your legs.
Your legs!
A little higher.
All right.
Twenty-five crowns.
Tonight at 8:00.
She's a pretty little piece, eh?
Think I could have her?
I can tell you,
I could really do with her.
What're you doing out here?
Did you see her knees?
She was nice to me--
He's all right, but we better get away from here.
They know who we are.
Why did you show your knees?
You weren't supposed to-- or were you?
How much did you show?
Up to here?
Or here?
Why did you do it?
I can't go and get my money now.
Don't you see, it's not my knees we're quarrelling about.
It's something else.
Don't talk about love, Sixten.
Can we butter our bread with it?
You want me to find a job?
Where? Tell me!
You want me to find a job?
Tell me! Where?
How am I supposed to do it?
Should I go in and say...
"My name is Count Sparre.
I have deserted from the Swedish army.
Can you give me work?"
Is that how I should do it?
"Forgive me."
Don't you understand what we have to do, Sixten?
Don't say it.
We don't have any choice.
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.
I'm sorry.
I'm not well today.
I'm so hungry.
Tell me how it's done.
- The heart.
- The temple.
And we thought we knew everything about our bodies.
How about some eggs?
- We don't have any eggs.
- Just give me a minute.
Don't be sad.
We're just going out to have breakfast.
How do you want your eggs?
Hard-boiled.
- How hard?
- I'm sorry?
- How many minutes?
- Four.
From the start?
No, four minutes after the water boils.
How many slices of bread do you want?
Everything ready?
Let's be going then.
"I hope this covers the rent.
Forgive the inconvenience."
You never told me your name.
- You never told me your name.
- My name's Anton.
My name's Sixten.
I can't do it.
You have to.
I can't.
You have to.
You have to.
We have no other choice.
Prodis Presents
No!
I won!
And I want my prize!
So what do you want?
That lily.
Good, I just wanted to refresh myself.
There’s shooting.
That’s probably hunters.
- Take it.
- I don’t need it.
Angelique, who plays like that?
You asked for prize and I brought you a flower 
Very well, I will return it to it’s place .
No!
What’s with you?
No, Nothing.
This is not a hunt.
Lets go.
- Let me go! I must avenge them!
- No! You’re alone!
- Doesn’t matter, let me!
- No! You run to Sanc?, and I will run to Monteloup.
We must alert all villages and tell them all to run to the castle.
- I’ll kill these dogs!
- Do what I told you! Run!
- Where is Angelique?
- I don’t know, Baron.
Where is Angelique?
Don’t worry, nobody will dare to offend our little  Angelique.
Place that cart by the main gate.
Prepare a bonfire nearby 
Monsieur Baron! Monsieur Baron!
Angelique, She’s here!
Let Mademoiselle Angelique inside.
Finally!
In times like this you should go far away from home. I couldn’t find a place for myself.
Help us, Saint Ignatius. Help us.
Help us, Saint Damian.
Help Us.
Here you are!
Where were you?
I must introduce to you:
My sister, Angelique.
Instead of running around God knows where,
You should have met  Monsieur Fallot 
Counselor of Parliament in Paris and my fianc?e.
If I had sat at home, I couldn’t have raised the alarm
How could our father pander to her pranks?
Immediately go change your clothes!
I’m shocking you, mother? And you, brother?
And you, Monsieur Counselor?
- Can’t you do without stupid jokes?.
- It’s better to joke stupidly, than not at all.
- You think that everything is allowed for beautiful?
- Yes, so what?
This is not the time for quarrels.
- She must respect me!
- I saved your life.
- Pray to God that this would help us.
- Let’s pray.
Don’t shoot, let them come closer.
Nicolas!
Charge! Charge!
This Plessis-Belli?res is a fine fellow
He fights like he dances
Road is open!
Bravo!
Congratulations, cousin. Your son is a hero.
We all owe our lives to him.
This is nothing for Philippe.
Sometimes it is nice to have a son colonel.
Any fight he turns into a miracle
He hides us all in the forests and waits until the bandits would run out of ammo then fire a musket volley and we tear them apart
This was wonderful interlude!
There was one man , all black, then suddenly his head burst and he became all red !
Time will come when you will be locked in a cage with someone handsome like that one
And he will take you away from here.
How wonderful!
And after that one man who was black became so red , so red
- Angelique!
- Yes, father. You need me?
- Come, say hello to our guests.
- I won’t go.
Come with me, I said!
- Very glad to see you.
- This is your brave cousin.
- Can I kiss her?
- I thought you were more gallant.
- So, I’ll make the first step.
- No, not me!.
This a real little devil! Let me hug you. She’s charming!
Cousin, this pearl needs a fitting frame.
You must take her to us in Plessis 
She will be wonderful friend to my wife
Let’s go with us.
I won’t.
She is so cute and modest.
Isn’t she, Adelaide? 
Philippe has arrived!
Take the horse.
Philippe, dear !
Allow me to introduce: Angelique my cousin, marquise of the gloomy dress
Recently she didn’t even let me kiss herself, and I don’t even understand why
She probably prefers shepherds
Quiet!
Bertram, Robert… 
Taste of countryside, this is wonderful like a fresh fruit from a tree
Try it, Louis!
Your turn, Bernard
- There’s plenty for everyone! Go ahead, Maxim!
- What about me?
Absolutely! You all can in turn.
- She smells like berries.
- And you smell like stables!
Hey ! Hey!
Hold her !
My dear young friends, run around, play, but away from here!
Go, go.
I should have cut my fingernails
No ? You like it like that?
You have as many clothes as onion has layers
How can you wear so many clothes ?
I remember my horse was painted like this all covered in laces.
Oh well, too bad. Go away
Come in.
- Monsieur, he is here already.
- Let him in.
Well, monsieur Cl?ment Tonnel 
Here is what you have asked for
Beautiful color , isn’t it?
Green – color of hope.
Such a little bottle and there will not be a king, or his brother , or Mazarini
- Is it reliable?
- Yes, of course .
Person is taken over by the weakness and then death.
- Monsieur Fouke gave you a letter?
- Yes, monsieur.
Here it is.
Great.
He sealed the agreement with his signature we will finally refresh the royal blood
Thank monsieur Fouke and tell him to wait
I will act when there will be favorable moment. Let’s go monsieur.
What a smell!
Did someone insult you ?
Cousin can’t give me money, he needs them to help Fronde
- What will happen to us?
- I don’t know.
Poor Sanse loves his sheep so much that their smell follows him everywhere
Do you think that smell of poison is better?
At least we are not plotting to kill the King!
His highness, Prince de Cond?.
Monsieur, this is my daughter.
What did I say?
Any conspiracy is always against the King starting from Julius Caesar
Cutie…
She is charming
Are you in love with Julius Caesar ?
I understand passion for history of
Gallic War , I was passionate myself
Victories of Julius Caesar do you know about them ?
No, monsieur.
You will have to catch up on your history in one of the monasteries in Poitiers
Fronde will give your daughter opportunity of education, baron.
I am thankful to you beyond all limits
I don’t want to go to monastery!
Wishes of the Prince are not discussed they are carried out, my child
Let’s go Angelique, that’s enough.
Shameless!
- Oh, Guillaume!
- Mademoiselle Angelique!
I haven’t seen you for so long.
- Is this beautiful carriage ours?
- Yes.
- Why my father didn’t come.
- He couldn’t, he is very busy right now.
Why am I taken in the middle of the year? mademoiselle, you will receive all explanations at home, in Monteloup 
- Girls are in the monastery in La Rochelle 
- Your brother are in Nior College.
- Where’s father?
- He is in the mines.
What mines?
I abandoned these mines long ago now turned out it was wrong
Peyrac  suggested me to open it again.
This man has a flair
You know, Peyracs – the most noble and the richest family in Languedoc 
And Jeoffrey is a great swordsman, brilliant and mysterious
He is insanely rich and also  a poet and a scientist
His castle in Toulouse doesn’t have equals
In a word this is a great match.
- Is he very old?
- No, but, of course older than you,
Must I marry him?
Your wallet or your life?
Nicolas!
Yes, this is me.
And you. I can’t believe it.
I thought I will never see you again.
How beautiful you became more beautiful than before.
Don’t look at me like that.
Ang?lique Sanc? de Monteloup do not talk with poor anymore
This is ridiculous!
No, you are grown up now
You are daughter of Baron, and I’m just a servant.
I thought about you every day, every night, Angelique.
Leave me.
Then it is not a lie, you allowed sell yourself.
You’re out of your mind!
And how is this called? You met him in the monastery? 
I never seen him!
This is the exact point,
Madam Countess de Peyrac
Count de Peyrac the most distinguished noblemen in Languedoc
- And the richest.
- What’s wrong with that?
Of course, rich husband it is always good.
But wait, you didn’t see him yet.
This Peyrac is a real monster.
- This is not true!
- No, this is really true.
He is not only ugly, he is also old, scarred, and limping
- You’re lying!
- A real monster!
However, in bed this might be interesting, no ?
Soon you will see for yourself that I’m right!
Make way for the carriage of Count de Peyrac!
Make way for the carriage of Count de Peyrac!
Malivin, I’m asking you, don’t forget that you are notary
Madam, Even sun grows dark next to you.
I’m the happiest of mortals because I’m marrying you.
But at the same time I’m the most unfortunate because my name is Bernard D'Andijos because I’m marrying you as a proxy
According to special verdict enacted in our province,
Persons from different cities who are getting married, do it by the proxy.
Count de Peyrac will meet his  spouse only during religious ceremony in his city of Toulouse, where…
- What did you wish for?
- I wished for you to fall in love with me!
- For the bride!
- For the bride!
Angelique, you could at least smile
Peyrac doesn’t like sad girls.
D'Andijos,  is it true that he’s ugly?
Ugly?
Ugly!
No, he’s not ugly.
He’s monster!
Come, Nicolas.
Love me, Nicolas...
Love me.
Come here.
I want you to be my first.
You are kind, handsome, sweet and very gentle
- Will you be gentle, Nicolas?
- Yes.
No, No!
No, Nicolas!
How dared you, traitor!
- Stop, Guillaume , I order you!
- Let me go, I will teach him a lesson!
Dog, You will pay for this!
- Run, Run!
- No!
- They will catch you!
- Let’s run away together!
You know it is impossible!
But I won’t leave you alone!
They will come here soon.
Run quickly, I will catch up with you later.
I will be waiting for you in the forest, by the big tree near the pond.
Will you really come ?
Yes, yes.
Take this horse and run.
Long live the bride!
Welcome, these fireworks are in your honor.
We’ve stepped on to your land, Madame, into possessions of that wizard de Peyrac. 
Please over here, Madame .
Ang?lique Sanc? de Monteloup, do you agree, to be always and in every way obedient to 
Jeoffrey de Peyrac,
Arvalle, Cavarex,
Moraines and Eristrue
Yes.
Your cause is lost, Carmencita.
I don’t think so, dear.
To earn love of Peyrac is not enough to just a village girl.
I know tastes for Jeoffrey
He loves what burns and can scorch.
What will happen if he falls in love ?
She is quite cute.
He will play with her, until he is tired. and he will return to me, on his knees.
- Germontaz, please let me have this gavotte.
- I wanted to ask you the same exact thing.
Fine, Fine, Gentlemen.
So are we going to dance?
Yes, monsieur Peyrac, your wife will turn anybody’s head.
- We aren’t at risk, Monsignor.
- Why is that?.
Your cloth and my leg doesn’t allow us to dance.
- Isn’t it pity?
- What did you say?
I said , pity, but God created beauty, so that everyone could admire her.
- Well, admire her Monsignor,
- She has wonderful figure.
Will you be distracted by smoke?
- What is it?
- This is a cigar, Monsignor.
Oh, what abomination,
It’s even scary to look at.
I brought them from America.
This is an excellent tobacco.
- Sniff it or smoke a pipe.
- Cigars are much more pleasing.
Always your striving to be original.
This disturbs me, my son.
Do you hear me ?
Excuse me, Monsignor.
Excuse me, I can’t dance anymore
I must rest a little bit.
What luxury, what riches.
I hope, my child,  you won’t forget my poor ?
Of course I won’t, Monsignor your parish is my parish
Such humility is very commendable.
But... you chose yourself a strange husband.
Your hand, Madame.
I will help you, Madame.
Please , Madame.
Good night, Madame.
Take me quickly... and leave
You have no reason to insult me.
Good night, Madame.
I heard a lot about your beauty.
It is above any superlatives.
Good morning, Madame. Count ordered to prepare a horse riding dress for you.
My alchemy.
I will allow myself, to introduce myself to you.
You are my wife and don’t know anything about me.
They say, that Jeoffrey de Peyrac is a sorcerer and friend of the devil
I want to explain to you what is my wizardry.
These are my masters.
He is from China, there I’ve been learning chemistry and astronomy.
In India I’ve been learning all kinds of poisons and antidotes.
I learned algebra from Arabs.
I’ve been their prisoner.
They sunk my ship, and made up my face.
Kouassi-B?  saved me.
This is my accountant, he is son of my wet-nurse.
He is a brave warrior.
When me and him were in mortal danger, we jumped from the roof of a high building.
He broke both of his legs, and I only one.
This is Fritz Hauer, I met him in Saxony 10 years ago.
This is him who taught me how to mine gold.
My gold... it is also yours.
Well, now you have acquainted yourself with wizard.
Everything is ready.
A bar of pure gold.
If Archbishop saw it, he would’ve thrown me into the bonfire.
- Then you are really a sorcerer?
- You think so as well?
- What all this show is for?
- For my wife to know me.
Thank you, for today’s night.
- Thank me for you leaving you alone?.
- Yes.
I couldn’t do it any differently .
How could I instill disgust for love in such a woman.
- Thank You.
- Don’t Thank me.
I know I will be rewarded for this sacrifice. and I’m sure that you won’t be just a wife to me... but a lover as well.
You are surely wrong, this will never happen.
- You’re gorgeous , even when you’re angry.
- Why did you marry me?
Until I met you, because of the mines.
- Business before everything?
- After I saw you, because of your beauty.
And now?
Because of courage. And when you will be mine
I will become the happiest man on Earth.
- This will never happen.
- Time changes a lot of things.
But please stay the way you are.
Allow me... to give you this bar of gold ?
Give it to these people.
Fritz, carry out the order of the Countess.
Hey, over here!
For Countess de Peyrac!
Why, dear Count, you are not following the tradition?
There is no test stone in the glass of  Countess
- There is no in mine too.
- Is this the reason?
And who here wants to poison my wife ? You ?
I didn’t mean any of your guests.
However all the security measures must be followed.
And the main measure, of course is the stone, which loses it’s colors, when surrounded in poison. traditions must be respected.
But Monsignor, sometimes they bring only harm.
All nobility follows this tradition.
Some even swallowed the stone... and died from that.
Madame, allow me to leave.
I must prepare a sermon about humility
I hope you will come to listen to it.
And now, since he’s left, tell us some story.
Please, Jeoffrey!
A love story !
Are they all in love with him ?
Possibly.
- And he is always so obliging with them?
- But they are his guests.
Oh what can I do with you, let’s go.
- What do they want?
- To listen to their idol.
So, a tale about love.
Once upon a time on a river bank a pretty girl was sitting... still very young and when...
I’m sorry, you shouldn’t listen to this.
Countess is tired and asking to excuse her.
Are you thinking that I’m so stupid ?
I’m afraid that 
I’m much more stupid myself
Young man was very persistent, but girl was a better swimmer.
- I will finish it next time.
- This can’t be! Is this all?
The Archbishop’s guards are after me.
I’ve ran away from Switzerland.
- Physicist Bernoui...
- Are you from Geneva?
Yes, but in Toulouse inquisition got on my trail. I almost got caught.
Come, in my house you will be in complete safety.
My such early visit is explained by my care about you.
Hiding a man wanted by inquisition is punishable by death.
What are you talking about?
An Officer of the Guards  insists that he saw him. He saw how he can in here
Would be nice to ask about this the beautiful Countess de Peyrac.
Kouassi-B? , ask Countess to come here , please.
You’re overstepping your boundaries Peyrac.
You can reach boundaries of my kingdom only by riding the horse.
- You will ride too far this way!.
- Not farther than the skies!
Will you allow me to ask Countess a few questions ?
Yes, if this will not tire her?
This night one man sneaked in here
Have you seen him ?
Tell the truth, Angelique. 
I didn’t see anyone.
Good catholic , of course couldn’t lie to her shepherd.
- What do you mean?.
- So you didn’t see anyone?
No.
Then my guards were just dreaming, and there is no runaway. and there is no mines in Salcini and there no any suspicious deeds at all suspicious?
Will you dare to show me , how you produce the gold?
Is this a challenge?
Yes it is a challenge.
I will wait for you tomorrow in Salcini without fail.
Everyone says that you are a bit of a  sorcerer
I want to know if this is true
- I’m thankful to you for this lie.
- I wanted to save this unfortunate.
When D'Andijos  came to take him from here  you have seen it.
I didn’t think that you can lie.
He shouldn’t speak in German,
I must understand everything.
Why did you let in this barbarian ?
He won’t understand anything.
So be it.
I want that someone else believed it.
- Those who play with fire are serving devil!
- This is not a game, my dear Bechene
This is a chemical process called purification.
- And what will be produced?
- Right it is lead.
While heating lead absorbs gold
Gold! I thought so.
And now watch, if you’re really want to understand.
We fill forms with ashes of bones
Ashes, bones, everything is clear Peyrac this is  the real sorcery.
Look Angelique, lead passes through ashes and the gold is left in the form.
You transform lead into gold ?
Fan the fire, fan it
Peyrac you are cheating people, but you will never be able to cheat God.
Don’t listen to his silliness
You are wizard. Everyone could’ve make gold if this was so easy.
He is so annoying.
Everyone knows 7 notes of octave, but only monsieur Louli can write opera.
Go give him one bar.
- What, he gotten so poor?
- Do what I said.
Allow me to accompany you.
But I’m not in a hurry.
And I don’t want you to leave.
You ride with the speed of a devil!
But I am a devil!
- What is it, another mine?.
- Yes and the most valuable one. You’ll see now.
- Where is she?
- Here, please.
She is 2000 years old, but she is still young.
Forever young, like a true love.
Just don’t tell me, that it is too beautiful
It is breathtaking.
I brought it from India.
It sank twice with me.
It’s like it was made for you.
Look at yourself.
I’m sorry!
You are repulsed by me.
I can see it.
I’ve lost.
You are not my wife and not my lover.
I didn’t love anyone like that in my life
- I can’t be without you!
- I’m very sorry.
It is unbearable, return to me!
Jeofrrey , I’m begging you!
Find somebody else, you can console you.
Very well, Jeoffrey! If I’ll be asked about you, I will find what to say !
Excuse me.
I will have my revenge!
Jeoffrey, I was looking for you to tell you...
Le chevalier de Germontaz.
I didn’t invite him.
What a surprise?
What brings you here?
His Holiness doesn’t wish to accept gifts from the devil.
Devil can’t answer to this insult, but I can!
I’m waiting for you tomorrow morning at 6 in Bressenclode !
Magnificent D'Andijos!
- You’re ready for anything for this vixen!
- Tomorrow in Bressenclode !
No, not with you and not tomorrow, but with me and right now!
Your choice of weapons.
A sword.
Germontaz is the best swordsman in Languedoc!
He already killed 20 men!
- Jeoffrey you’re crazy!
- Yes, but this is how is.
But this is won’t be a duel but murder!
Stop him!
This is not in my powers anymore.
Begin.
You’re crying ?
You’re gorgeous.
This is unjust...
You are the beauty itself, and my face is all covered in ugly scars, and such leg.
You don’t notice any of this, when you’re in love.
- You are not afraid of me anymore?
- No.
But I haven’t changed.
I love you!
No, love is definitely blind.
Are you falling asleep?
Jeoffrey, I just understood ,how foolish
I was. But I didn’t know you then.
This was before...
Before what?
Before us.
Are you sleeping?
I was a fool too.
You?
I waited for so long.
Waited for what?
To tell you...
About what?
That I love you, love.
Jeoffrey!
Yes, dear?
Madame, Countess!
Madame, Countess!
Madam Countess, look he walks!
Florimount is walking already!
Urgent letter, monsieur Count.
Report to His Majesty that he will honor me greatly.
Can you guess who is going to visit us?
I didn’t invite anyone, and I don’t want to see anyone but you.
But to accept this visitor is a great honor.
The King will stop here on his road from Saint Jean de Liu with his  young wife.
Dish “The Ship of Love”
This is a turkey, inside it a duck, inside which is a quail with Parma ham.
Recipe is mine.
Accompanied with truffles.
Skylark with p?t?... 
His Majesty my brother won’t get up, until he eats everything. This will take couple hours
This can’t be helped.
“Pomerole”,from the year 1692.
Very light, Sir.
What is the wine over there ?
I think, something Roman ?
Absolutely right, Sir,
Julius Caesar loved this wine.
I don’t have such good wine cellar as you do.
- You’re probably a great connoisseur of wines?
- No, I more prefer music.
Yes, I saw your collection of instruments, it’s admirable.
Besides this, you are collector of medals and antique sculpture.
Wonderful.
- I love it, Sir.
- And this is enough?
To love – means to wish passionately, and then you can achieve anything.
You wished a whole lot!
I’d like to wish like you as well.
By the way, tell me about the gold, rumors about which reaching me.
Imagine Sir, that you have a rock.
And you explode it, by using gunpowder.
So am I, blowing up my hills, crush them, heat them, separate minerals and receive gold.
Your friend Peyrac is out of his mind..
Teasing my cousin ?
You amaze me, Peyrac.
But your biggest jewel is something else entirely.
- And you are hiding her from me.
- Sir?
Madame de Peyrac.
They say, she is unbelievably beautiful?
She is waiting when you allow her to appear.
- She’s astonishing!.
- Quiet!
You are delightful, Madame.
Thank You.
- You should be more careful!
- Me?
But yes. These shoulders, these breasts, this is a challenge, my dear!
Court is strict, ladies are clothed up to their ears. Very unpleasant fashion, but can’t be helped.
Anna Maria Louise, please introduce me.
De Vardes, the most dangerous seducer in Paris.
- What is the danger?
- I will show it to you.
And the biggest jackass.
And he looks similar!
I like you very much,
Peyrac and you. You are so funny.
If you’ll visit  Paris, drop me a visit.
Looking at all this,
I’m dying from hunger!
Frankness for frankness, wait, I’ll be right back.
Would you order to start a ball,
Your Majesty?
Her Majesty the Queen is a little bit tired.
Why are you laughing?
You were so beautiful last night, surrounded by all these court ladies.
A pearl among the pees.
- Will you never cheat me?
- Never.
- If you ever do this...
- You will kill me.
Quick, Quick, hurry up!
King doesn’t like to wait...
King couldn’t do that...
Common, hurry up, faster!
The King left and didn’t tell me anything ?
You know well that The King is everywhere at home and everywhere master.
He already gave you an honor, by stopping here.
- Where to?
Carry it outside!
Everything take outside!
Hurry up!
And he left just like that, didn’t say a word?
But I have saved his life.
6 years ago Cond? was in
Plessis-Belli?res and was preparing a plot.
He received a bottle of poison, and I happened to be nearby and saw everything.
I’ve noticed where prince de Cond? hid the chest with poison, and stole it.
Don’t laugh!
Now prince de Cond?  has excellent relationship with the King’s brother.
If he finds out everything, he will want to get rid of you.
Where are you going?
I must see the King.
- And you will tell him everything?
No, what for?
But no one leaves my house like that.
Leave him – he did it from sadness, you have seen his wife.
Don’t risk our happiness, Jeoffrey.
This is what I want to protect.
I saw how he was looking at you last night.
I’m afraid for you.
If the King is our enemy,
I must know about it.
Jeoffrey!
- I came to say good by.
- Who let you in?
Your husband rode away, your servants ran away, I couldn’t leave you alone.
- Go away!
- How many times I’ve been told that!
But all ladies later thanked me for don’t listening to them
The weren’t scrupulous!
Let go of me!
Help someone!
Don’t touch me!
Help ! Help!
Don’t raise your sword, I don’t fight with scoundrels , I just slap them!
Nothing, I will still get to her.
She won’t get away from me.
You can be assured, she will be mine!
Where is Peyrac?.
He decided to talk with the King.
He mustn’t do that!
He’s out of his mind!
I must return him immediately, even if by force.
Say good night.
Good night, my baby.
Good night.
What happened?
- What happened?
- Master was attacked.
He killed one of them, but they were too many.
They took Master away in a carriage.
- Where these Archbishop’s men?
- No, soldiers of the King.
- And King saw all of this?
- No, ambush was earlier.
This is impossible.
What did he do to them?
- D'Andijos, where is he ?
- He went to Paris to talk to the King.
Order to prepare a carriage.
I will go as well.
I must see the King.
- Look, what do you say, I learned it?
- What?
How to get to Rue de Pale ?
Drive along Seine until the last island, and there take first street to the right. 
- Did you stole anything from them?
- No.
I had a good harvest today.
You know what, let’s go to my place?
Leave me alone, do your business.
I have to think.
Do you want to compromise me?
Your husband is under arrest, and you come into a house of prosecutor’s wife!
- Into a house of my sister.
- Ah, a sister?
- And did you think about her in Toulouse?
- You are hating Jeoffrey?
- If you married a freak...
- Jeoffrey  a freak?
You don’t know anything. Jeoffrey is the best of husbands and excellent lover!
- Are you not ashamed to say such thing?
- Do you know  such thing?
- I’m disgusted to listen to you!
- And I pity your husband.
Why, Madame?
- This is you who should be pitied.
- Have you found out anything?
But remember, this is a secret.
- In the morning your husband was transferred to Bastille.
- So he’s in Bastille...
This is serious.
Very serious.
But no one comes out of there!
I can admire your self-control, but order for arrest is signed by the King.
But into prison registry are not entered neither the name of Peyrac no the offence.
- King wants to avoid the scandal.
- Exactly.
- And that means , he will free Jeoffrey.
- I’m not sure about that.
Then what will happen to him?
Sometimes  a prison, becomes a tomb.
Sorbonne, to me!
I must talk with Countess de Peyrac,
I’m from a Maitre Fallot.
Quiet Sorbonne, we are in high society.
Who is this?
Madam de Peyrac,
I’m Fran?ois Desgrez , an attorney.
Maitre Fallot told me that you need a cunning man.
But need an attorney at law, not a cunning person.
I understand, how no one else will take up the defense of your husband.
And now to business, I only need some information from you and a payment.
You won’t get anything. And I will do perfectly fine without your services.
I have connections in the court.
Well if it is true...
Sorbonne!
Jack loses,
Queen wins.
But why was he arrested,
I still can’t find this out.
Jack and 10.
I win again. I’m lucky today.
He was placed in a special cell.
What will happen to him now?
Jack and 10,
I win again.
He will be tried, well see what happens then.
Is it impossible to save him?
End of deck!
New game!
I will do everything that’s in my power.
But too little time has passed.
King still haven’t forgotten my participation in The Fronde.
- 10,000 louir.
- Bank.
I ran all over Paris.
Finally I have found you!
Oh, my friend!
Angelique... bad news from Toulouse.
Your estate was arrested, everything at all is sealed.
But Why? Did we hosted the King badly ?
- On the contrary, too well.
- Did it make him jealous?
I don’t know, but it’s possible.
However I think there’s different reason.
- Countess de Peyrac?.
- Yes.
Madame, I must give you this invitation.
His Highness, King’s Brother awaits you tomorrow at 4pm
- Me?
- You.
The talk will be about your husband.
But this is a secret for now.
So, at 4pm in Louver.
- What is it?
- Everything will be ok.
God, You are almighty, protect Jeoffrey, tell me what to do.
I will bear anything for Jeoffrey, for Phlorimone and for the child, which I carry.
It’s too late, let’s go Madame.
It’s dark in the streets, we can be attacked.
- Who should be I afraid of?
- You’re brave, but I’m scared. 
Paris is a terribly city, and I don’t even have a light.
His Highness is asking to excuse him.
He is not feeling good, sudden bout of fever.
- When should I come then?
- Tomorrow, here, at the same time.
- Thank you.
- Tuilri Gates are closed already.
Pass through the garden of Infantes.
Please over here.
This path is much shorter,
In 20 steps you will be on the New Bridge.
For God’s sake, save me!
My maid was just killed!
Ah you’re my cutie,
I’m glad to help you.
De Vardes, I beg you, help me!
Save me!
- You have enemies?
- Here everyone is my enemy!
What about me? I’m your friend and ready to serve with all heart and all body
- I only need your order.
- Then you will help me!
- But we have to hurry!
- You’re right, my dear.
- Where are you going?
- To the sofa.
This may not be very comfortable, but I must fulfill my promise.
Sorbonne, come along!
I have news for you.
- I’ve seen your husband.
- You’re joking with me.
I this uniform I snuck into Bastille, saw Peyrac and found out reason of arrest.
So  you have seen him?
How is he ?
Let’s go inside, 
I will tell you everything.
No!
This is not most elegant place, but it is quiet.
Let’s go in or I won’t tell anything
Julienne, now you can return him this. 
Peyrac is locked in Bastille by the order of Archbishop.
Because of death of his niece?
Oh no, that duel has nothing to do with it.
Then because of that monk.
Yes. Peyrac was playing with inquisition and he knew it.
But Archbishop wanted a symbolic punishment.
And would’ve been satisfied with some small revenge.
He didn’t expect it to turn thins way and wanted to stop the case, but couldn’t.
King himself gave order to arrest.
But Jeoffrey loves the King!
And King don’t love those, who surpass him in any way.
- And my advice to you –  leave Paris.
- Never! My husband is waiting for me!
- We must help him get out of Bastille.
- Only executioner can help him!
You’re lying, not telling all!
You don’t know anything!
It’s not easy to figure out state secrets, but I’m trying.
Not only your husband is mixed up in here, but you yourself.
Particularly, King’s Brother knows that you keep some terrible secret, which involves prince de Cond?, you know what I’m talking about.
But to save his friend, he  may destroy you.
- This is what I’m telling you to run.
- Never!
Anyway Peyrac will be burned as a wizard at Plaza de Grev 
- But he is not guilty.
- Not only guilty end up on a scaffold.
Excellent! Forehead of Diane, don’t you find? Gaze of Venus...
And this hand, it is like a milk river!
Superb!
Step aside, I can’t see anything!
And all these delights cannot compare with you, Anne Mary.
How can I thank you!
Honor me please, raise  a finger.
Finger of a fairy!
Don’t thank me, I didn’t even have to drop to King’s feet.
He is disposed in your favor, and if you will properly use  this...
Go, quickly!
Sir, Countess de Peyrac is here.
- And you knew him well?
- He was very original.
There you go, she finally came to the King.
We must act... and immediately.
Sir, excuse me for my boldness.
Tradition prescribes me to speak first.
Decidedly, you are even more beautiful, than my memory of you.
Your golden dress, then... in Toulouse, was charming.
- But what’s with you?
- On that day my happiness ended.
- Happiness?
- Since then I haven’t seen my husband.
Unbelievable, you are so charming and cute, are you really in love with you ugly and lame husband?
He is kind, fascinating man, You had opportunity to confirm that yourself.
Yes, he can conquer women...
A real sorcerer.
This is not true!
- You forget yourself Madame!
- How can you believe rumors, Sir?
I believe in what I have seen myself.
Where does he get gold?
- He produces it from the oar.
- And produces too much of it.
So much that he decided, that to him everything is allowed.
Such luxury is not for mere mortals.
- He was richer than the King.
- He thought only about good of the Kingdom.
By being richer than everyone else?
Having means to raise an army and start mutiny?
I swear, he was never part of any conspiracies.
We are your loyal servants, Sir.
Rise, Madame.
- You are so strict not with everybody?
- Who told you that?
Leave it...
You are denying to the King, that what you allow to his courtiers.
And you believe in these lies?
This is only a whim for you.
I know, right now I’m at your mercy.
I can’t do anything,
And you are all powerful. Well...
But I do not want to wrap my hands around a ghost.
You will be thinking about Peyrac, about this devil!
Go away, I do not wish to hear about you!
- Save him, Sir, I’m begging you!
- I have already answered that. Go away.
Tonnel, watch out, that no one can come in.
You must die, Countess.
You have a choice sword or poison.
- Help anyone, save me!
- Only in death is salvation.
You won’t dare!
We hope you yourself will do the dirty work.
We must hurry Philippe.
In 5 minutes we must be with the King.
No, No!
Prefer poison?
Wonderful.
This is the best poison you absolutely won’t feel anything.
Yes, I know what poison that is!
It was made for you, and I hid it!
Exactly,
You know too much!
Drink it!
Drink!
I saved your life, Monsieur!
Don’t kill me!
Drink!
God sees everything, monsieur!
Yes, God... Well, let her pray for her soul.
Witch doesn’t have a soul! Drink!
Drink or else I...
Help! Help!
Save me!
This woman is under spell!
She is very dangerous!
By the order of the King, I must send her to monastery Saint-Honore
You’re lying!
- She splashed alcohol into de Lorraine 
- Not alcohol, but poison!
- She’s crazy.
- This was a poison!
You’re crazy yourself, cousin.
I know Countess de Peyrac.
Enough cousin.
I’m King’s brother, and you are just being tolerated here.
Go away, Go away everyone!
What are you waiting for?
I don’t leave my friends in danger.
I won’t leave
Madame de Peyrac alone.
But I’m asking you to retire.
I give you my word of a noblemen, that your prot?g? has nothing to fear.
My word is not enough for you?
This request is for you too cousin.
Don’t be afraid, dear, you have word of my cousin.
I gave my word, this is true.
But Chevalier de Lorraine didn’t give it.
Revenge!
Guards to me!
Guards!
Faster!
Guards!
Guards!
Get them!
- Run to Monteloup, here you will be killed!
- But you? You are our only friend? 
That’s why I’m staying!
Run, I will hold them off! 
Seems to me that now even me will come in handy.
Yesterday my maid was killed.
- And today they wanted to kill me.
- What prevented them from doing it?
- People on the street?.
- This wasn’t on the street, in Louvre.
They are so bored in that barn?
Good By!
I was right?
- I couldn’t believe it.
- Unfortunately.
- I’m listening.
- I’ve gained an audience with the King.
And what?
Jeoffrey will stay in jail until trial.
Sorbonne, it’s time for us to act.
Let’s go.
During the trial
I cannot receive you.
Afraid for you husband’s reputation?
No offence, But you don’t want us to be in your situation, do you.
What about baby, Madame?
Let at least him stay with you. and second one will be born soon.
- Madam, where will you go?
- It’s nothing, dear Barbe, world is big.
Where will we go?
I don’t know.
But I do.
- Where is this.
- Behind temple.
This is ideal place for you.
Police is afraid  to stick it’s nose in here.
Kouassi-B?, sell the horse and a carriage.
There will be enough for your living.
- I will not allow myself this, Madame.
- Thank you.
This is your new dwelling.
Is this you?
Raymond!
Sister, please at least respect my cloth.
You are amiable as usual, didn’t change at all.
Don’t hurt your brother. I’ve found him with great effort. He promised to help us.
- This service doesn’t allow you to smile?
- No, situation is very serious.
- When will you see the exorcist?
- I don’t want to hear about devil anymore.
- The you shouldn’t have married a sorcerer.
- He’s not a sorcerer, and I will prove it to them.
And we will help you in that.
Farther Kirsher will be main witness during trial. He promised you this?
Yes I was able to convince him.
And if Peyrac accused unjustly, father Kirsher will save him.
You are afraid for nothing, he is innocent.
Gentlemen, the honorable court.
Bring in the accused.
By order oh His Majesty, a commission was established to decide your fate. as it was before in a case of Saint-Marse.
Accused, take the oath.
I swear to say the truth, but...
Nothing can be added to the oath, or else you will be judged as a mute.
Well, it’s very convenient.
Mute accused, defense is also mute... and justice is mute.
Wonderful
Then I swear to say the truth... no matter what it is.
Prosecution has a floor.
Monsieur Chairman,
Messieurs Councilmen.
A heinous crime was committed and it contained in the sorcery.
Such crime is punishable by death, and I demand a death penalty.
Without right for appeal.
Inquisitions Prosecutor has the floor.
I tested the accused with seal soaked in holy water.
When touching it, possessed by the devil will groan and shake.
10 times I touched Peyrac,
10 times he groaned and shook.
- Is this true?
- Yes.
With the seal identical this, dear Conan Becher ?
Yes, it is classical seal for exorcism.
- May I repeat the experiment?
- But...
Give me your hand.
What is it?
This seal is an exact copy of a seal used by monk work of apprentice of Maitre Antoine, the locksmith of Bastille.
- Can I call in a witness?
- call.
Here’s a craftsman, who made both tools.
This is true.
- How old are you?
He is underage.
Guards!
- Take Courage!
- You will need courage more.
Peyrac, get up!
I’m asking, Monsieur Chairman, permission for my client to sit.
He has serious injury from childhood, and last days he underwent torture.
One supposed to stand before tribunal!
Stand Up!
Jeoffrey!
Order!
His Majesty magnanimously forbid presence of the public in court.
In case of appearance of disorder
Court will make decision behind the closed doors.
Calling witnesses of prosecution and we will have honor to convince the tribunal that accused is possessed.
Small duel.
Monsieur Germontaz is very strong.
The strongest.
First sword of Languedoc.
Impossible to defeat Germontaz, but my master...
Thank You
I didn’t force him to talk.
Gentlemen, accused, regardless of his injuries, defeated chevalier de Germontaz legendary fencing master.
And there is only one explanation of this – Peyrac put a spell on him!
To put a spell on the niece of the head of Inquisition? You’re flatter me!
This doll was found in the coffin of one of your lovers.
What will you say?
I will say that it looks just like me...
Your doll had a burial service in a church, like a martyr!
What, you consider yourself a God?
But God is beautiful.
Peyrac charmed judges, no we have to only convince them. Only you father... holy father Kirsher doesn’t doubt de Peyrac
I was sure.
And I hope, in Bastille, if only they will let me visit him,
I will be able to exorcise all devils torturing your unfortunate husband.
Opinion of the Great Exorcist of Devil will have weight even in this tribunal.
Yes, they still believe me.
Flames of Hell! Look it is tricolor of Satan! He’s Devil!
Lead, it is just lead, everything else is a Satanism and cheating...
Lucifer always wanted to change the world created by Almighty.
Tongues of fire are the snakes, and smoke is dreams of damned souls!
Peyrac!
Quit whining.
Kouassi-B?, take a bar and show it.
Don’t look messieurs, this was created by Satan himself.
Show me the oar.
- This is gold containing pyrites.
- How would you know?
I make lectures about it in the University.
To order!
Take those Satan’s helpers out.
Look at this unfortunate woman.
Peyrac wasn’t satisfied with violence he did to nature.
He also put an evil eye on a human.
I’m calling all of you to bear witness.
He is a death itself!
See, she is under his spell.
Talk!
He took me away from my family, took me from my husband!
And I can’t be without him not even an hour, not even a minute.
To save this poor victim we put her into monastery!
He breaks up crucifixes and burns them while laughing watching them in flames!
He throws them at me and burns me!
Stop this comedy! This hysterical woman is no more possessed than myself!
No, don’t touch me! I swore, that no one will touch me!
- Enough!
- I’m giving you my sould!
She foams from her mouth!
But this is just a soap!
Do you hear?
This is laugh of the Satan!
Take her away.
I think gentlemen than now no one will deny, that this woman was bewitches.
Fortunately, a hysterical comedy cannot be  reason for death penalty.
And I can assure you, gentlemen, that my client is not a sorcerer.
I have a proof.
I, reverend father Kirsher, of Society of Jesuits. official exorcist, do swear with our soul and consciousness that Count Jeoffrey de Peyrac is not possessed by the devil.
Signed on the day 25th of August
Year of 1660 of Our Lord, in Bastille.
So, the Church itself, the most concerned party, removes from my client accusations of sorcery.
Will you really prefer to the opinion of father Kirsher ravings of this obsolete monk.
Tribunal cannot trust document, which was made up especially, to win this hopeless case.
Father Kirsher himself will appear here, and then we will see who is falsifier.
I demand to remove maitre Desgrez for insulting this court.
And I demand, that reverend Kirsher was invited to this hearing.
Well, the Court doesn’t object.
Hearing will be resumed tomorrow.
Thy aren’t here...
You’re alone?
Farther Kirsher is not at his home, not in his residence, not in parish, nowhere.
- He must be found.
- I’ll go with you!
- You cannot walk anywhere!
- I will go anyway!
Quiet Please!
Hearing is resumed.
Monsieur Chairman, it is 11 o’clock already.
I believe, that the word play of maitre Desgrez was long enough. and I think, that it is time...
Monsieur Chairman, body of father Kirsher was found in Seine.
He was strangled.
This is you who ordered his death.
No, you, it is clear for everyone!
You made him to sign that document and then get rid of him.
Gentlemen members of tribunal this is murder.
Dear members of tribunal, if we talk about murder, the in the last days there was 2 attempts to murder Countess de Peyrac...
.. In Louvre.
- Are you accusing King’s Court?
- No, those who are obstructing justice.
You are insulting His Majesty.
Guards, Arrest him!
This court has no rights!
The trial is falsified!
Archbishop himself was against the death penalty!
Sorbonne!
Justice is being suppressed here!
So, gentlemen of jury
Listen to the voice of your conscience what sentence do you propose? 
It is your decision.
I’m not sure of anything.
I can’t decide.
Who is for death penalty?
King doesn’t like indecisive people and doesn’t trust them.
Peyrac... Court declares you guilty.
Naturally, I have to be killed.
And I will tell you why.
The Fronde advances and tears Kingdom apart.
Crown Princes want death of the King.
But wind changes, and King wants a commander – Conde.
He summons him, forgiving the Fronde, never suspecting about prepared poisoning.
You are reeking of poison yourself!
Fool!
To be careful, Conde drowns with gifts  King’s brother.
He must  find poison,
Conde’s spy Tonnel discovered, that poison is stolen by Angelique de Peyrac who knows about plot.
Since this moment Angelique is sentenced to death.
But to reach her...
They must first remove me...
You were removed
.. This is why I was arrested.
Way is free! These gentlemen can now make short work with my wife and breather freely.
And what reason for arrest?
Most stupid and improbable...
.. The Sorcery
That’s all.
Retrial!
I demand a retrial!
This is accomplice of Peyrac!
We are noting, monsieur from University your solidarity with the accused.
But we will fulfill your wish.
Justice is merciful.
Justice is objective Monsieur.
It is no higher us and not lower us, it is absolute.
Who is for retrial, please raise you hands.
No thank you, my friend.
Nobody?
Accused de Peyrac,
Court sentences you to death.
You will be burned at a stake on the Plaza de Grev.
I will leave kids with my sister and will go to the King again. He will pardon Jeoffrey.
You won’t enter the Louvre.
There are warrants for arrest.
- Today I will leave Paris.
- And you will leave me?
Put on this peasant dress, and I will take you to father in Monteloup.
There you’ll be able to hide.
This is impossible, she will compromise the family. I’m already being sent to exile.
While Joeffrey is alive,
I will not leave Paris.
Then take this purse, give it to the executioner on Rue de la Fermry.
- He will save Jeoffrey?
- He will strangle him, relieving of pain.
My baby!
- What is there, Barbe?
- These are children of your sister.
My husband, Count de Peyrac,
I beseech you.
30 ecu, all is good. Be assured he won’t feel a thing.
No, this can’t be. It is impossible.
Will Joeffrey really die.
- Give me your hand, I will tell your future, Madame
- It is too late..
There is someone, who can save you and Peyrac.
- Do you know me?
- Of course not.
Bandits can save Peyrac, when he will be taken to execution.
- Bandits...
- Only they can help you.
Very well, let’s go.
This is me, Barcarolle, mission accomplished.
- Look, a widow of de Peyrac.
- Not a widow just yet.
Shut up!
I waited for you Angelique.
I kept you in my sight and knew, that today you will come here.
- Nicolas!
- Nicolas doesn’t exist!
Nicolas waited for you in the forest for 2 days. 2 days and 2 nights.
Finally soldiers founded him, but he killed them, and since then he is called Collambreden
Help me!
I can of course steal even sentenced to death.
- But what will you give me for it?
- Anything you want!
Just don’t promise money or gold, you don’t have any.
I will offer you this.
Peyrac is to be executed tomorrow at 6am.
I know by which road they will take him there.
I will free your husband, and he will live.
But we two will run to America, like we decided, when we were still kids.
Promise me, Angelique.
There we will start a new live.
Nicolas!
Peyrac will live, I will rescue him.
So tell me yes or no.
I accept.
To arms!
Damn, we were tricked, this is a straw stuffed doll!
Everyone quickly to Plaza de Grev!
Probably this Peyrac was a worthy man, and they were really afraid of him.
Villains, foul murderers!
Angelique!
Here she is, that witch!
She must die this witch!
Catch this withc, and throw into fire!
Let her burn in the Heaven’s name !
Seize her!
Don’t let her get away!
Catch her, damned witch must die!
Put me down!
Put me down!
Give us the woman!
Give us the woman!
Let me go!
Give us the woman!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Well, you’re welcome to shoot.
But you see how many we are.
There are much more of us.
You’re saved.
Do you hear, you’re saved Angelique?
Here no one will harm you even the King. You are in safety.
And we don’t have to move to America.
You will stay here with us.
I offer you strength, which needed, to start everything from the start.
You can rely on them.
They are not devils.
They have not very pretty faces, but they are all good fellows.
You will become their Marquise –
Marquise of Angels.
Angelique, you will be happy yet.
You have friends.
You have two sons. And also there is still revenge. We all will be with you.
Angelique, you must live...
Angelique, marquise des anges
-Finished.
-PIay the last few bars again.
-Was it better today, ma'am?
-Yes.
-When can I come again?
-Your mother said...
... you had to leave.
Aren't you?
Papa says there's no need.
We're quite safe in Paris.
The day after tomorrow then, at 4 o'cIock.
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Give my regards to your mother.
-I will. Goodbye.
-Go straight home.
Oh, how are you, ma'am?
She's just left.
I can try, but she walks so fast.
Yes, I'll go at once.
No, ma'am... HeIIo?
Hello?...
Come on! Quickly!
Out, or I'll shoot!
Stay here by me.
Don't go! Don't go!
Mama! Mama!
Edith!
Go away! Go away!
-Get on!
-You too!
Regional train number 4327.
Lead all the prisoners...
... to the main square!
Get off!
Come on!
Quickly!
Everyone off the train!
Mama! Mama!
Get out!
Come on!
Move!
Come down!
Hurry up!
Left!... Right!...
Left!... Right!...
Attention, pIease!
-No! Mama! No!
-Edith!
-Edith?
-Yes?
They'll kill us all at daybreak.
-How do you know?
-I heard them.
I can speak German.
They'll kill the children and the old people.
Two SS said that near me.
God, if only
I could see them again!
Shut up!
Stop yelling!
Come here!
Where are you going?
-Let's escape, Pierre!
-And go where?
I want to see my mother and my father again.
The door's open.
You come too, let's go!
It's no good.
Hold him.
Goodbye, Pierre.
And who are you?
Where are you off to?
-Let me come in, please!
-What, in here?
Don't send me away.
They want to kill me!
Quiet, stupid!
-You're Jewish?
-Yes.
Well then!
You won't need this any more.
Come. Maybe we can both be of some use to each other.
Hurry!
-What is it, Sofia?
-I brought you this one.
She arrived tonight. Jewish.
They've seIected her... for the gas chamber but they haven't registered her yet.
All right, Sofia. Go now.
All right my hat!
What do I get?
-I haven't even any bread.
-Give me some alcohol.
-No, it's bad for you.
-Who cares!
You're sick, Sofia. Go now, I'll give you something next time.
My bIock's being transferred to a labour camp. I leave tomorrow.
Bye, Doctor.
They say it's a good camp.
Try to get her into our convoy.
Remember, block 1 2
-How old are you?
-Are you here on your own?
-No, with my mother and my father, but they split us up.
Wait here.
You're in luck.
If no one had died tonight,
I couldn't have helped you.
Take your clothes off.
Quickly now.
I told you to strip off.
Everything, unless you want them to spot you at once.
Hurry up!
Put this on. Come on!
Please yourself, but if you want to live, you must put...
... this smock on, now.
We don't have much time.
Come on, hurry!
That black triangle on your smock stands for criminals.
Political prisoners wear a red triangle, like mine.
The Jews have a yeIIow star.
But black triangles get the best treatment.
The SS pick them as camp oversees.
They call them ''Kapo''.
Beware of them.
They're mean and they can do what they like to the prisoners.
But you stand a better chance with your black triangle.
You're taking the place of a French thief.
I haven't reported her death.
Her name was NicoIe.
Number 10099.
You're name is Nicole now, understand? Remember that.
Come on, what's your name now?
-Nicole.
-Nicole Niepas.
-Nicole Niepas.
-Number 10099.
In German it's...
Remember that. And don't show this for a few days.
Wait for it to heal.
I'll be right back.
I have to see if I can get you assigned to a hut.
Nicole's is out, they'd be on to you at once.
Come here!
March!
Join the others!
Come on!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...
... of the blocks number
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 appear... before the Commander for general roll call!
Come on! Move!
Mama! Mama!
No! No!
Mama! Mama!
Mama... Mama...!
You've got to live, Nicole, and think of nothing else.
Just live, that's all. Come...
I managed to get you assigned to block 1 2.
That's where Sofia is, the girl who brought you here.
Block 1 2. The number is on the hut, you can't miss it.
Tomorrow you'll leave for a labour camp.
It's better than this.
Nobody will know you.
Your name is NicoIe, always remember that.
If they ask anything, say you left the infirmary today.
You're not Jewish any more, understand?
You hear me, Nicole?
Off you go.
It's up to you now.
Try to live. Good luck!
Good luck... Go on.
How many days will it take?
If you chew it well and close your eyes, it tastes like bread.
Don't think about it, girl.
Shrug it off.
You forget everything here, except cold and hunger.
The rest is a lot of rubbish.
Isn't that right?
No, I don't think so.
-How long have you been here?
-Over six months.
Wait then. We'll see in a year... if you're still alive.
You listen to me, girl. In here the cleanest one stinks.
-What can you see, Isabella?
-Still nothing but woods.
-What kind of woods?
-I wouldn't know.
-Looks like oak.
-Still god-awful Germany then.
Right, who'll give me some bread for a cigarette?
Where do you get all that stuff?
It isn't like that, you know.
There's one thing they can't take from us against our wiII.
Our seIf-respect.
I'm positive of that.
What's wrong? Are you sick?
Go on, cry...
Stand up!
-Back!
-Get out of here!
Come on! Move!
Quick! Quick!
It's stopping again.
Take a look.
-What can you see?
-A station...
-but there's no name.
-Another train full of prisoners.
This damned war will never end!
-They're not speaking German.
-You sure?
-Can't you hear them?
-What's next to Germany?
-France?
-You'd Iike that, wouldn't you?
Poland!
Open the wagons!
Come down!
Move!
Quickly!
Hurry up!
Come down!
Get off!
Line up!
Stay stiII!
Now, move!
Come on, march!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Keep in step!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Any news from Warsaw?
How are they there?
Better than you, Iass...
Better than you.
Good luck.
Back!
Go back!
Go now! Go away!
Line up!
Come on!
Look what you've done!
Give me another ration!
Nicole...
I realized from the start you were a nice girl
... in spite of your black triangle.
Who sent you along with us?
The infirmary doctor, right?
He's a good man. He has saved a lot of girls like you.
You're Jewish, aren't you?
No, I'm not Jewish.
Attention, please!
General roll call!
Line up!
Attention, please!
General roll call!
Line up!
-How many are the politicals?
-About 50 percent, but you...
... can't trust them. Most of them have been here at least 2 years.
-They renegade?
-They adapted.
One's even been made a Kapo.
The woman on block 10.
She was a good partisan once, then bit by bit...
I speak fluent German.
-Could that do me any good?
-Probably.
If they make you an interpreter, you couId be useful
... on a lot of occasion.
All in all, this is far better than Auschwitz.
Yes. We sleep better, we eat better. You've seen that.
They want to get the most out of us.
It's obviously in their interests.
But there's still the screenings nightmare.
-Here too?
-Yes.
The SS doctor examines us every four months.
The oldest and thinnest are sent away.
A sore's enough, the slightest wound, and you're replaced.
You came to replace
100 other women.
-Where did they take them?
-Nobody knows.
But you can be sure... there's a gas chamber there.
What's wrong, silly?
Go to sleep!
I don't want to die!
Come on! Work!
Quicker!
Move!
No mill, no meal!
Idiot! Can't you look where you're going?
Damn you! I'll teach you to leave your work!
I'll warm you up!
1 5 days in solitary!
-Hi, Carole.
-Hello.
-What on earth did you say?
-I don't understand.
-What are you, anyway?
-Russian.
She hasn't been here long.
She's a bit...
Anna, the Red Army's coming, right?
Yes, yes, it's coming.
Interpreter!
Well done, they let you go.
I didn't think you'd make it.
Did they bit you up again?
Have you understood?
Now go and tell them!
Attention, please!
The Kapo said...
Who took my potato?
Give it back, Nicole.
It's mine.
-Nicole...!
-I gave it to her.
-I traded my undershirt for it.
-Who cares!
It's mine! I put it on the stove a few minutes ago!
You must have eaten it without reaIizing.
If it really was stolen, get it back.
I'm suprised at you.
You're a political!
You mean the politicals are better than us?
You heard her ladyship?
She's scared though.
Yet she was in the Resistence.
I wonder how her ladyship resisted back home?
Hey, Georgette, stop that, will you!
I wouldn't brag about being here for stealing.
Come here and repeat that if you dare!
-I'm coming.
-Attagirl, you show her!
-Come on, stop that, girls!
-Let me go!
Blocks number 1 and 2!
Wash yourseIf!
What a spring! The water gets colder every day.
Her ladyship expects hot water? It's melted snow.
Aren't you going to wash, Nicole?
That's what they want.
That's just what they're after.
To cancel us... turn us into animals.
We have to hold out.
-By washing?
-That too.
It's a way to make us feel like human beings.
To stop ourseIves turning into brutes.
Come here! All of you!
Out!
I've got through three screenings. Last time...
... I had a sore on my foot.
They didn't notice.
Luck, that's all. If they don't like the look of your face...
... being healthy won't heIp you.
-Does the grey still show?
-No, don't worry.
I have good hands, good feet.
Why worry about my teeth?
You'll see why, you'll see.
-You know you have to go.
-You're all right.
Shove her out, or they'll take it out on us.
Good luck... be brave.
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...
... of the blocks number
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 appear...
... before the Commander for general roll call!
-Do I look less pale, now?
-Yes, that's a lot better.
You think I shouId take the bandage off?
Sure, they'll see that first thing.
Stand up straight and smile.
And stick your chest out.
If it shows a bit, all the better.
-Hide your hands.
-They're not that stupid!
-What hope have you got like that?
That's you. Smile... smile.
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...
... appear before the Commander!
Get dressed.
-Left!
-Come!
Interpreter! Come here!
Feet... Your feet!
The other one.
Good... your hands... Hands!
Turn them over!
-Left!
-Go!
Next one!
Come!
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...
-Here she is!
-Which is the good side?
-Left or right? Tell me!
-I couldn't find out.
Left or right?
-I tell you, I don't know.
-It's easy to find out.
We'll just ask where they sent the oldest women.
Well, Ninette?
Left or right?
Why are you asking me?
Maybe I made it.
Sure, maybe you did.
But was it left or right?
Right.
Hell!
Don't cry.
They won't send you away.
You'll see,
Red Army come in time.
Right?
I fooled them!
Look at my hands!
I made it!
Look!
I showed you!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Stay back!
Hey, you! Line up!
Drop dead!
Well, aren't you going to say goodbye?
Now you're scared of saying goodbye to me, you bitches!
Cowards! They've turned you into a bunch of sheep!
Cowards!
You too! Cowards!
Damn murderer! Scumbag!
Scumbag! Scumbag!
You don't scare me any more!
I know where you're taking us!
Vultures! Brutes! You'll die too!
They'll kill your kids!
Your damn mothers!
Damn your mothers!
You, you and you!
Come with me!
In step!
Hitch her up!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Take the lime!
What are you doing?
Her socks...
Good.
Hey, you!
I have to send another girl to the SS.
I'll take her after roll call.
Tell number 10099. It's worth her while, tell her.
-But she's a child!
-Exactly.
Nicole!
Alice wants to make you a ridiculous proposal.
She'd Iike you to go...
... to the SS tonight. You don't want to, of course.
-You don't, do you?
-Why not?
-What has she said?
-Nothing.
But you have no experience.
Have you ever been with a man?
-No.
-No?
But if I go, will they give me something to eat?
-Nicole!
-Ask her that.
Ask her!
Anyone play cards with me?
-No.
-Play on your own.
... and good night...
Look what I brought you!
Like her?
What can you do with that?
Are we supposed to adopt her?
She's pretty, isn't she?
I had her cleaned up.
-But she weighs 60 pounds!
-I like them like that.
Right, baby? Come on...
Have fun then!
-Did it come out?
-The hell it did!
-How did it go?
-Just great.
I was right. She's a virgin.
She was a virgin!
Hey you... Why are you still here? Scram!
Excuse me, you said you'd give me something to eat.
-What did she said?
-She wants to eat.
Tomorrow!
Tomorrow...
Attention!
The Camp Commander...
... wishes you all a Merry Christmas.
Now sing!
How is it you've come today too?
Your mates sent for me.
Guess they changed their minds.
They're in town getting drunk.
-Why didn't you go with them?
-I don't like drinking.
What do you like, Karl?
Just the war?
Where were you last Christmas?
In Cracow. And you?
Here. And before that?
-In Paris.
-Do you like Paris?
It's just another city... only a bit noisier.
It was good the first day, when we entered.
And the Champs Elysées, the day of our parade.
Out.
Do you mind... not being at home?
Because it's Christmas?
Nonsense!
What things are important for you?
My country, I think. Only my country is important.
What if you lose the war?
Impossible.
But if you do lose?
Your turn, Karl.
We can't get news from the front any more.
Morale is pretty low, even among the politicals.
I told the women in my hut to sabotage the work.
-They just laughed.
-It's the same in the factory.
We need the right arguments.
-They'll listen to talk of escape.
-Let's talk of escape then.
That's useless, since escape is impossible.
It's not useless. Look...
They're as thick as thieves now.
Are you nuts?
That was a wollen shirt.
At least two more packs, or I'll have it back.
-Okay, I'll try tomorrow.
-How about some more jam?
-Civilians go for that.
-Karl says nothing must be... wasted because his mates at the front are starving.
Rubbish! What does he care about his mates at the front!
He'll have forgotten by tomorrow.
-All right, I'll try again.
-Nicole!
Hurry up! Go inside!
The block leader's leaving.
I might get picked to replace her.
If so, they'll need a new Kapo for this hut.
I could put your name forward. Tell your friends...
... about all I do for you.
And get busy!
If one of them steps in, it's your lucky day.
Good evening, Miss! How are they at the command post?
-What do you mean?
-Just asking how they were.
Mind you own business in future!
Line up!
Prisoners, attention!
You are prisoners of the German Reich.
You work for the German Reich
... and in return the Reich feeds you.
It's a cIear-cut relationship.
Whoever betrays this relationship is punished.
The prisoner 871 1 sabotaged the factory work, by attempting to damage the machines.
The prisoner 871 1 was caught in the act.
Sabotage is punished with death.
Translate.
Translate! Translate!
It is right...
It is right that such criminaIs should hang. Is that clear?
Yes, Sir!
Now proceed!
Hey, you! Look up!
1 5 days in solitary and
3 months on half rations.
-Is it time?
-Five minutes.
Good.
I've applied for the front again.
Even one-hand men should be needed now. I hope so!
-Don't you like it here?
-No, I'm bored.
-Why, do you like it?
-I do now.
I eat well, I sleep weII.
No work, no screenings.
-Is that all you care about?
-What else is there?
When are you going to eat that?
At night, or else I can't sleep.
You know it's less nourishing when it's stale?
And the effort not to touch it, that's bad for you.
It weakens you, you know that?
You're still on half ration, huh?
The Russians sing now.
One of your songs.
We don't know what we're allowed to sing.
Whatever you know, just sing it well.
-''Holy War''
-Don't be funny.
-You want to get us killed?
-We don't know anything else.
''Holy War''. Let's sing!
The Russians!
You were right...
The Red Army's come.
One moment... Show them the empty bunks! Go on in.
Come on... Come on...
My boys...
My boys!
Well? Aren't the rest of you going to hug us?
Where have you come from?
Say something to us.
Pilot.
-Quiet... quiet!
-She's right, they'll hear us.
Hold on.
Show us the bunks that need dismantling.
We'll answer your questions while we work, okay?
It won't be long. The Allies have landed in Normandy.
The Germans lost Stalingrad, the Red Army's at the Dnieper.
-Couldn't they counter-attack?
-No, not any more.
The whole front's on the move.
You'll see.
-And the Red Army will get here.
-What?...
-The Red Army will get here.
-Yes...
They'll get here and free us all.
-Is that really true?
-Sure!
They brought us here to build fortifications, because they're...
... retreating and we'll see them all run away from here.
We'll skin him alive and dunk him in vinegar.
-Who?
-Faust!
You'll do what?
-Nothing. I was joking.
-Watch it!
And you men, get on with it!
-Who's that?
-Our Kapo.
Don't you have them?
No, we just have a hut representative.
You're not scared of a kid like that?
You'll see, son... You'll find out what a Kapo is.
-Is he Faust?
-Yes.
-What does it says?
-''Touch Faust and you die''.
-The SS wrote that?
-Yes.
-They're nice to cats.
-Are you nice to everyone?
No... not everyone.
Come on, get your mates.
It's roll call soon.
-They haven't called us yet.
-I'll take you.
-Attention, please!
-Roll call! Roll call!
-All the Kapos must...
... count the prisoners and wait for new orders!
Come on, you, get moving.
You ate the lot!
Give it back, you bitch!
-Give it back!
-What's going on?
She stole my bread!
Nearly half a loaf I'd put by!
She scoffed the lot!
Bitch! Scumbag!
Tough luck!
Now go to roll call.
-What am I going to do?
-Go!
Is it true?
-I couldn't stand it any longer.
-Let's go, it's roll call.
-Let me be, NicoIe.
-Let's go.
See? Washing every morning didn't do you any good.
Leave me here, please.
-You preached so well.
-Leave me here.
Remember? You kept repeating it to me.
''We mustn't let ourselves go, we must react''.
And look at you now!
-Exactly like all the rest.
-One! Two! Three! Four!...
But it's natural. You preached a load of rubbish.
Now what's got into you?
Where are you going, silly?
Kapo, come here and bring three prisoners!
Come on, Boris!
Get moving, Boris!
-Come on, try!
-I can't do it.
On your feet! At once!
Get to work!
What are you doing?
Come here, you filthy prisoner!
Come on! Go on working!
Come nearer!
See that?
Stay here and rest.
-They won't notice if I go.
-Thank you.
They say our advance stopped and they are counter-attacking.
-They'll be in Moscow by June.
-That's what they say.
Meanwhile they just shot another man and we've waited 3 months!
-What do you want to do?
-Anything, whiIe there's time.
-Before we get to be like them.
-Hey! Wait!
Could you take this to...
What are you doing there?
Damn you!
-Read it! It's for my mother!
-It's forbidden!
-Give me the address.
-Alma Rudnicka, Hoza 1 2...
-Bitch! You're like an animal!
-Hands off, you idiot!
Letters are forbidden,
-and speaking to civilians!
-Who are you? One of them?
Why do you do it?
-Just because.
-What happened, Nicole?
-If they saw you, you're dead.
-What did he do?
He wanted to send a letter home. I tore it up.
Stand here and don't move.
All night. Stand to attention.
If you lean forward, there's the high voItage.
If you step back, the sentry will get you.
If he moves, shoot!
Good night... comrade!
This is how they should dress us Kapos. Nice, isn't it?
-Look!
-They're going steady!
In other lagers Kapos can wear civilian clothes, did you know?
We should ask to do that too.
Nice! What did you give for them!
Not much, three packs of cigarettes.
What are you waiting for?
Want a cigarette? Catch!
Go on, have a smoke!
Pick it up, I won't shoot you.
I won't shoot! Go on!
Don't you like smoking?
You need it to move a bit, to rest your muscles, or else you'll never make it.
You can't make it.
Come on!
Don't you trust me?
You won't make it.
You'll never make it.
You'll croak anyway!
Sentry post number 7.
Changing of the guard.
-Is he still alive?
-That one's a stayer.
Want to bet?
No, not like that. Let's wait and see what happens.
Okay. Come!
Attention, please!
All the prisoners...
... in the main square!
All the prisoners...
... in the main square!
Attention, please!
All the prisoners...
... in the main square!
All the prisoners...
... in the main square!
Come... come!
One! Two! Three! Four!
Join the others!
You must work!
In step!
Come on, quickly!
Join the others!
Here, bread and margarine.
Go on, blow your whistle!
Call your pals!
You think a bit of bread is enough to put everything right?
Hey, that's artillery!
That's our men!
Hear them? 100 kilometers.
Less than 50!
It's a matter of days now.
The war's over, Nicole.
We'll go home, we'll go back to our old lives, we'll forget.
Come on! Get on with it!
Wonder how it will feel to be free again?
To do whatever we like... anything at all.
They celebrate in my town when any of us go home.
They welcome us with music and flowers.
And we dance all night... we sing... we shout...
Nobody sleeps that night.
Do you like dancing, Nicole?
Yes, I used to love it.
Run for it, Sasha! There's only one German on the bank.
I'll distract him, so you can run to the river and get away.
But why? It's only a matter of days now.
They'll have to let us all go.
No... who knows what they'll do.
There won't be another chance. Today's the last day...
-they'll bring you out to work.
-Get moving!
With two hands! Hurry up!
What about my mates?
There'll be a reprisal.
Why worry about them?
Come with me, but be carefuI.
I don't know the area.
They'll catch me.
The partisans are over there.
We hear shots now and then.
Let's wait for him to move away.
What will you do?
Me? What can I do?
I'll stay with them.
-Don't you want to get away?
-And go where?
But where will you go when the war's over?
I don't know,
I haven't thought.
Where do your parents live?
Dead... they're dead.
-Go now, Sasha!
-No!
I can't do it.
Attention, please!
The Blocks number
18A, 24B and 1 3C...
... go immediately...
... to the Commander!
Attention, please!
... 18A and 1 3C...
... go immediately to the Commander!
Look! They're pulling out!
Get off! Get off!
Stay back!
Go away!
Come on! Quickly!
Stay back! Back!
Look at them! They're worse than animals!
Animal sense when they're about to die,
-but this lot...
-Die?
-Yes.
-Who told you that?
They transfer us to Germany to a suitably equipped camp.
Seems they can do away with over 5000 a day.
Not you, silly! They'll make us auxiliaries in the Wehrmacht, with a uniform, pay, and a clean police record.
Good. You had me scared for a minute.
-Coming with me?
-No, I'm busy.
Georgette! Here she comes!
Excuse me, Kapo,
I was on cleaning duty today and I found this.
This is how I found him.
Poor Faust!
He was so sweet.
You know they're going to kill you too? All of you!
Sasha! Come here.
-What's up?
-Sasha...
-Tuesday?
-Yes, the day after tomorrow.
-We've got to try.
-You know it's sheer suicide!
We can't escape from this camp!
We can't escape from the gas chamber either.
We've got to find a way to cut the high-voltage Iine.
We must prepare some tools to cut the fence.
I'll sharpen some stakes, but it'll take 3 days.
-Too long.
-But they watch us!
What do we do about the high voltage?
The powerhouse is near the camp gate.
A Brit worked in there after that woman killed herseIf.
-We've got to talk to him.
-I did. He's willing to help.
But he said we can't get near the powerhouse and the high voltage is never off.
-The powerhouse is locked?
-Sure.
We need an imprint of the lock.
-You go and get it, cIever!
-Hush!
Maybe they're moving out.
Are they really going?
-Yes, yes, they are.
-Quiet, I can't hear a thing!
Maybe they're leaving and they'll let us go.
You, you, you... and you.
Get to work!
Come on, idiots, move!
The imprint of the lock.
-Thanks, Nicole.
-How come you all trusted me?
-We weren't wrong, were you?
-Do the women know about me?
-Not yet.
-Load the truck!
Move! There's no time!
Sasha...
I want to tell you another thing.
It isn't true I'm a thief.
And my name isn't Nicole.
I... I'm a Jewish.
-Nicole!
-See you later...
... at the washhouse.
They'll be too busy to notice.
Yes, Sir!
Yes, Sir!
-Will we make it, Sasha?
-Yes, you'll see.
We'll make it, Nicole.
Come.
You'll really take me home with you?
Sure, you'll come with me.
What will your family say?
Let's see...
My father will look at you silently, then he'll say to me: ''Who is this, Sasha? Your stuff?''
He'll shake his head and go, saying he's busy.
-He won't like me then.
-Very much, but he won't say it.
-Some old peopIe are like that.
-My father was the same.
My mother, though, she'll start crying.
She'll ask if you're hungry, if you're thirsty.
If you're warm enough, if you want a rest.
And if you answer no to all her questions, she'll smile and she'll say to me...
What?
She'll say: ''She's a nice girl, Sasha. Well done.''
I'm not a nice girl, and your mother won't like me. I'm different.
-I...
-Nicole.
You still haven't told me what your real name is.
-Edith.
-Edith, listen. That's what...
... my mother will say and I'll say: ''Sure, she's a nice girl.''
And she'll leave it at that.
We'll be able to go out, and I'll show you my town.
You'll like it, you'll see.
And in the evening we'll dress up and go out again, the two of us together.
We'll go wherever you like.
All right, Edith?
-We'll go dancing, Sasha.
-Yes...
-What time is it?
She'll be here any minute.
-The stakes?
-Ready in the workshop.
-Yanko's coming soon.
-I can go, Salomone.
No, Igor Borovin and
Yanko Milovic will go.
We have work to do here.
So, by 10 at the latest, if all goes well you and Yanko...
... will bring the guns here.
Nicole goes to the powerhouse.
By 10:1 5 he shorts the circuit.
At 10:20 the Brit has to check the power's off.
There's no need to check, we'll hear the siren.
-What siren?
-When the high voltage...
... is turned off, the aIarm sounds.
The powerhouse is next to the sentry post.
... in front of the main watch-tower.
The SS will run up, but she'll have knocked out the system.
-And then?
-Everyone can get away.
But not Nicole.
They'll kill her.
She doesn't stand a chance!
What do you want to do then?
Get us all killed?
-You like life, don't you?
-Like anyone who's alive.
-Would you do it?
-That's a silly question.
You know I'd never get near it.
They'd stop me midway.
But if you were her, would you do it, Salomone Reitman?
-Maybe...
-Maybe!
And you're a man.
You have an idea, you fought.
But Nicole... she's only 1 6.
She knows nothing about these things. She's suffered so much.
-It's not up to her to die.
-I'll go, Sasha.
-Let me try.
-That's impossible.
I've seen Anna. She says the women are going berserk
... praying, crying, talking about rebelling.
A few nearly lynched an SS who walked in, but fortunately...
-Where's Anna?
-She's waiting near the fence.
Tell her to pass it on about the escape.
The orders stand except the signal will be given by a siren.
When they hear it, they have to run to the fence.
Come straight back, it's nearly time.
There are 2000 women in the camp.
They've all suffered and they have a right to live.
And us? You say we fought and we have an idea.
What do you mean by an idea?
It's 6:40.
What are they doing, Sasha?
Are they standing for me?
It's settled then. Let's go.
Can I have a word with you?
You mustn't tell her anything.
Swear you won't.
She'd refuse.
Why should she agree to do it?
-Swear, Sasha.
-Yeah. Why should she agree?
Her life in exchange for so many others.
But it is right to reckon like that?
-No.
-Well then?
Yes, it's monstrous, forcing men...
... to reckon like that.
But in this case, it becomes necessary and even right...
... to kill someone in order to save many others.
We're killing her, you know that?
No, Sasha, it's not us.
We're not the ones to blame.
Come on... swear.
Swear.
I swear.
Aren't you busy now?
We have 5 minutes left.
Come, there's still so much to say.
We must decide how we'll find one another.
I thought about it all night, you know.
As soon as I've cut the power, I'll come here.
-You'll wait for me, Sasha?
-Yes, sure.
And we'll escape together.
But if we miss each other...
There, see the tallest tree down there? Can you see it?
-The tallest one of all.
-Yes.
We'll meet there.
I want to tell you something too.
The first times we met...
I wasn't thinking about escaping, you know?
I didn't say all those things to persuade you to heIp us.
It was only because I was falling in love with you.
I love you...
I love you so much!
You can feeI it, can't you?
Yes, Sasha.
Thank you for everything.
No... you mustn't thank me.
You see, things happen that we can't do anything about.
There shouId be love and happiness for everyone and instead, we're forced to kill and hate.
-Will you understand?
-What? I don't understand.
Sasha, it's time.
Yes.
What?!
Yes... yes.
Yes, Sir.
They're not sending the trucks.
-We have to eliminate them.
-But it takes too long!
Have them start digging a pit at once.
Hide these documents!
Thank you.
Good luck...
Good luck, Yanko.
Attention! Attention!
GeneraI roll call!
We'd better go back.
Come on! Get on with it!
-Just our luck!
-Why is that?
HQ didn't send the trucks.
We'll have to bury them too, afterwards.
-Nice, huh?
-Alice, come here!
Get moving!
Are you sleeping?
Hurry up!
I'm off then, Sasha.
And remember, the tallest tree.
-Edith?
-What is it, Sasha?
Quiet!
As soon as you cut the power... the siren will go off.
They'll come and they'll kill you.
That's how it is, but I have to ask you to go anyway.
None of it's true any more then?
You must go.
What should I do now?
What should I do?
You must go.
You... you want to get me killed?
You must go. You must.
The lives of everyone depend on you alone.
-Yours too, right? Yours too!
-What's going on, Nicole?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
-When do we go?
-When it's all over.
-Where to?
-Germany.
The war's over now.
They conned you, Karl.
They conned you too.
What will you do now?
I don't know. And you?
I don't know.
Living isn't all that necessary.
True... it isn't necessary.
-Go on working!
-Traitor! Scumbag!
She'll go.
I'm sure she'll go.
You'll see, she'll go.
Nicole!
Nicole!
They conned us, Karl.
They conned us both.
Take this off me.
The land of Israel is enlightened...
God is Israel...
God is the light.
Lord, my Lord...
... you who break the chains of the slaves...
Major Frick!
Major Frick!
Tell the town commandant of Rjukan that an attempt has been made on the Reichskommissar's life!
He'll arrange for 15 civilian hostages from the district of Telemark to be shot in reprisal.
Like the look of it, gentlemen?
Most interesting.
We are well-informed of what you do here, Herr Nilssen.
A little experimentation with heavy water, that's all.
With deuterium oxide.
Yes, yes, we know.
Nilssen.
I must tell you, the time has come to make a decisive transition from theory to practice.
You've done enough experimentation, my dear fellow.
This room has more significance for us than you can possibly realize.
Oh, well, one day perhaps he will realize.
Don't you think, gentlemen?
Forget about fertilizers.
This factory is required by the Reich to increase its production of heavy water by 400%.
We want 10,000 pounds of heavy water by Easter next year.
That's impossible.
It's not at all impossible,
Herr Nilssen.
What is necessary will always be accomplished.
All the more so when the whole future of the Reich is at stake.
All the technical details have been worked out in Berlin.
Here, take a look.
And notice also our modification of the deuterium formula.
But what is the reason?
I don't understand.
That was a firing squad, my dear Nilssen.
Let it be a warning.
Major Frick here will be in charge of security.
And it will be the maximum.
Halt!
Stupid fool!
Dr. Pedersen.
No, I'm sorry, he's busy.
He's working in the darkroom.
Hey, you can't go barging in on Professor Pedersen, you know.
How long is he likely to be there?
Could be there all afternoon.
I'll wait for him.
Shut that door!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Can't you see the red light's on?
I'm sorry.
I'd like to speak to you.
Don't you know the damage you can do barging into a darkroom when the signal light's on?
I've got to give you a message.
All right, I'll be in touch.
Now, what do you want?
I come from Telemark, near the Norsk Hydro factory.
I didn't ask where you were born.
I come from Chief Engineer Nilssen.
He wants your opinion on something.
He says only you would understand it.
- Understand what?
- The message.
It's in here.
What's this, some sort of student joke?
It's not a joke.
And I'm no student.
It contains an undeveloped photographic negative.
Open it.
Who are you?
Knut Straud.
I used to work on the sawmills, but now I fight Nazis.
One of those.
Get back to your sawmill.
I'm not interested in your messages.
My work is here.
You understand?
I've just seen you at your work.
I'd rather embrace one Norwegian than kill a dozen a day, friend.
Look at this.
Every time you people play boy scouts and blow up a few Nazi trucks,
12 hostages are shot.
That's your great work?
Keep it.
Get out of here and take your toothpaste with you.
A lot of boy scouts risked their lives to get this to you.
I must get to England.
We've contacted London.
They're expecting us.
How are we for fuel?
I'm sorry. My wife is a little clumsy.
No, no, it's my fault.
How far you going?
Kristiansand? Further up?
As far up as she'll go.
How far will she go?
We'll make it.
I've counted 12 in the crew and eight passengers, plus the Quisling.
All we need now is a little fog and the trolls on our side.
Don't tell me a big boy like you believes in trolls.
You all know what to do?
Well, Doctor, press this little thing here and the bullets come out there.
Get off the bridge!
We're taking over this ship in the name of the Royal Norwegian Government.
This ship's going to England.
Like hell it is!
You've got a choice.
Sail under the King as free men or be prisoners for the rest of the war.
Good evening.
Stay where you are.
We're taking over this ship in the name of the King.
Look out!
- Quisling bastard!
- Serves him right.
What can we do for you?
Give us a hand.
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- What's going on?
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
There's just been a slight change in our itinerary.
Change! What?
Now, instead of going up the coast to Kristiansand, we'll be going to England.
England?
Now, don't be alarmed.
Now or never, Captain.
Fools. You'll never get across the North Sea alive.
Enemy planes will spot you.
That's the chance we're going to take.
There are mines, thousands of them.
And neither the British nor the Germans happen to have given us a map.
- You believe in the trolls?
- Oh, yes, he does.
Well, so do I, providing we've a sharp lookout.
England, Captain?
South, southwest.
South, southwest, sir.
Thank you, Captain.
Mines! Mines!
- Full astern.
- Full astern, sir.
Hard aport.
What's going on?
What's all the commotion about?
- Something about mines.
- They said mines.
- Stop engines.
- Stop engines, sir.
- Slow ahead both.
- Slow ahead both.
It's too close.
You trying to blow us up?
Get that pole.
- Full astern.
- Full astern, sir.
Hang on this line.
The next time you want to play billiards with a mine, remember my job is to get you safely to London.
Your passes, sir.
What the devil is heavy water?
It's a liquid with a heavier hydrogen structure than ordinary water.
It also possesses properties useful in the study of atomic energy.
Yes, but what's the significance of the Germans ordering this vast increase of the stuff?
In the formula that Nilssen sent me, the Germans have added a new component to the accepted equation.
Look, I'd rather wait till that formula's been examined by Professor Einstein and
Dr. Oppenheimer in New York.
But, Professor, surely it's something more than just a doubt that brought you all the way to England?
It is. It's a very great fear.
And if it's justified, we'll know about it soon enough.
Thank you.
- I'll lead the way, shall I?
- Thank you.
Good morning, George, Charlie.
I wonder, gentlemen, would you mind?
Thank you so much.
This is Professor
Sir Roderick Logan, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, perhaps I should tell you or perhaps
I should not tell you that we have just come from a very brief and equally a very painful session with the Prime Minister on this.
Ah!
Aye, well, at any rate, here is the report that came from Washington this morning.
Following their initial reading of the data brought by Dr. Pedersen from Norway, um, plus certain other indicators, incidentally, Professors Einstein,
Fermi and Oppenheimer concurring, the scientific and military consensus in America is that the Germans may be ahead of us in the race to achieve controlled atomic fission.
If they are ahead and they get their atomic bomb, they've won the war.
Ah, there you are, Knut.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
Come in.
Come on in, Mr. Straud.
Thank you.
- Come on in. Take a chair.
- Thank you.
We've examined the situation very carefully, and it's been agreed in London and Washington that the factory making heavy water must be destroyed without delay.
Personally, I agree with you, Bill, that bombing is, in this instance, the most obvious method.
Right.
At the same time, we wish, if we can, to avoid large-scale civilian death.
This is also clearly the wish of the Norwegian government.
I suggest, gentlemen, that Dr. Pedersen, who knows what's at stake, and Mr. Straud, who knows his country backwards, be asked to return immediately to Telemark, in order to resolve this question.
That is, to determine, with objectivity, whether a ground attack by commandos is practical or not.
Agreed?
Agreed.
How do we get back to Norway?
The simplest way, by parachute.
We're miles off course, but I know where we are.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Yes, if you're a reindeer.
Where do we go from here?
I'm taking you to one of my radio operators.
He's our contact with London.
Now what?
Over that mountain.
A farmhouse.
Another one of my operators.
I know this place.
Oh, Knut Straud.
Come in.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Wonderful to see you.
Hello, Anna.
Good God, what are you doing here?
Well, just dropped in for a cup of coffee.
Uncle.
- Uncle.
- What is it?
Rolf is here.
Oh, damn!
Hello, Uncle.
Hello, Rolf. What on earth are you doing here?
Oh, Mr. Straud.
It's always good to see you.
- You know each other, too?
- Yes, we've met.
What a surprise.
I had no idea you were all such good friends.
Hadn't you?
Listen, I think you'd better know that we've put you in some danger by coming here.
What?
Well, we're working for the resistance.
You? You're not serious?
Well, he got me into it.
Was that wise, Knut?
You seem to know each other quite well.
Oh!
Everybody knows everybody here.
Let me introduce you to my ex-wife.
Can we have some coffee now, Anna?
I've no time for coffee.
I'm working for the resistance.
Well, we both can't be working for the resistance.
- It's ridiculous.
- You look terrible.
He's been dragging me around the Vidda for two days.
There's some pajamas and hot water upstairs.
You two had better go along up to the bedroom.
I... I take it you know the way.
Yeah, I know the way.
- Follow me.
- Thank you.
It's odd, isn't it, to have him in the house again?
What's odd about it?
You and he shared the same bed for two years, and as far as I remember, you damn seldom got out of it.
You should be asleep.
Oh, I just thought I'd drop in, all in the line of duty, to discuss resistance tactics with a fellow fighter.
By the way, how's your resistance these days, hmm?
Fine. How's yours?
Mine?
Well, I was great until I met that boy scout Knut Straud.
Well, I was content.
I had a good life, and now look where I am.
Yes, it's exhausting to commit yourself to others.
You still commit yourself beautifully, like you always did.
I'm not your wife now, Rolf.
I know.
You're not anybody's wife. Are you?
Go to bed.
Sure.
Yes, you would like that, wouldn't you?
Do you mean you would?
You know what you were born for.
No.
Yes, you know what you were born for.
Tell me.
Say those things to me.
Your voice, never out of my head.
You're the same, you're my life.
Yes, you are.
You've got the words wrong, Rolf.
You see, it's not so easy seducing your ex-wife.
Students are much easier, aren't they?
I just don't believe in you anymore.
- Anna.
- Will you please go?
Please.
Sleep well.
We'll make this our main transmitter hut.
Can't risk the farm.
It's getting too dangerous.
I'll make sure that Nilssen is at the church this morning.
Good.
Uncle, be careful.
The town is full of Germans.
Merry Christmas, Uncle.
See you in church.
Merry Christmas.
It's Sigrid.
Oh, that's Arne's wife?
I've got a message for you from Arne.
He's in England. He's fine.
Will you see him again?
Tell him I've a message for him, too.
He'll be a father in the spring.
They'll have their 10,000 pounds of heavy water by Easter.
The marker, microfilm of the factory, exact details.
Ammonia and hydrogen pipes.
You see how close it is to the village.
Look how near the factory is to their homes.
Look at the rabbit!
Land mines.
Come on.
Oh, excuse me.
I don't think
I've seen you in Rjukan before.
Who are you?
Well, I've come to visit my fiancee for Christmas.
I see. Your fiancee.
How very charming indeed.
And what is his name?
- Well, my name...
- I'm asking her.
Jan Kristansen.
Mmm-hmm.
Let me see your identity card, please.
Certainly.
Excuse me.
Here it is.
Oh.
A-ha.
Your text, I believe?
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
And the compliments of the season to both of you.
How did you like our town, Rolf?
Oh, I liked it.
You should have seen the torchlight parades we used to have.
Yes, every November.
It was wonderful.
Flaming torches, you could see it from miles away up in the mountains.
The snow was whiter then.
Yes. It was all the lights on the snow.
Then we made snowballs and threw them at the torches.
Remember, Knut?
This is a detailed layout of the factory.
Well, they've got 3,000 pounds of heavy water in there right now ready to be shipped to Germany.
Well, let's decide on what message we send to London.
There's only one message.
"Examined area.
"Consider ground attack totally impractical.
"Recommend alternate method."
You mean, to bomb it!
Yes.
That would destroy Rjukan and everybody in it!
Possibly.
Bombing is impossible.
The factory is deeply imbedded in a gorge.
The only way across that gorge is a narrow bridge, 75-feet long.
Two men with machine guns could hold off a battalion.
I can get inside that factory with ten men,
Ten men, and blow it sky-high.
They've got millimeter guns on every hill.
And without destroying an entire village in the process.
Barbed wire. Land mines.
Six thousand lives.
Do you realize what...
Anna, keep out of this.
We're talking about something that affects the world.
Look, I don't give a damn about the world.
I'm talking about my town, her town, his town.
Now we live there!
I'm talking about people.
Do you understand that? People!
You weren't so squeamish when hostages were being shot.
They're people.
This is a hell of a lot more important than blowing up a few Nazi trucks.
I was fighting a war, Doctor, and I was doing my job.
And I'm doing mine.
I don't like it.
And I didn't ask for it.
Anna, you live here.
It's natural you want to save your own people's lives, but this is something that has to be done.
It's important.
Important enough to kill 6,000 people?
Yes.
Look,
I want to know what's so important about heavy water.
I don't make the rules.
I can't tell you.
I want to know, Doctor, and you're going to tell me.
I'm telling you nothing.
Do you think that
I'm going to sacrifice the lives of 6,000 people on the opinion of a playboy scientist?
And for what?
I want to know, Doctor, and you're going to tell me.
You want to know what it's all about?
All right. I'll tell you.
That's what it's all about.
You understand?
- Of course you don't. Stupid...
- Why you...
Stop it! Stop it!
I thought you boys were here to fight the Nazis.
Why don't you both send in reports and let London decide?
- All right.
- Fine.
See, Anna?
Knut and I fight, but we still manage to live with each other.
I know you fellows are anxious to get back to Norway.
Knut Straud and Rolf Pedersen are on the mountains of
Telemark waiting for you.
The main assault group, the Royal Engineers Commando, will come in two or three days, weather permitting.
We are counting on you to get a glider landing strip on the lake ready for them.
Well, happy landings.
Best of luck.
For God's sake, where have you been?
We've been looking for you halfway around the Arctic Circle.
What are you talking about?
We've been waiting for your message for the past five weeks and it hasn't come.
I'm starving.
We're expecting more company tomorrow.
Yeah, 50 British commandos.
From the Royal Engineers, they land tomorrow night.
I've got a message for you from Sigrid.
You're going to have a baby in the spring.
Well, how is she?
She's pregnant.
Rolf!
Who are you?
My name is Jensen.
- What do you want?
- I'm on a hunting trip.
Hunting for what?
You'd better come with us.
I won't say a word.
Ever. On my honor.
Look, my village is Haukeland.
Anyone there will tell you who I am.
Listen, I hate the Nazis, believe me.
My wife is in a Gestapo prison.
Listen. Listen, her father's name is Jon Trendt.
- That's why she's in prison.
- Trendt?
The resistance leader?
Yes.
It fits.
Shoot him.
No, we'll keep him.
We can't risk the whole organization because of one man.
- I'm with Knut.
- And me.
I think Rolf is right.
So do I.
We'll have a show of hands.
Those against shooting him?
We'll have your skis.
Take them off.
Listen.
I still can't believe it.
They weren't even Norwegian.
50 British commandos.
In a flash, the whole operation's over.
A waste.
That's what I can't get out of my head.
They're not going to be wasted.
We're going ahead, tonight, now.
As if they were with us.
It's the same plan.
We all know it.
What are you talking about?
We're going to get into that factory and complete the mission ourselves.
Knut, I'm sorry, but you're mad!
- There's only nine of us left.
- We'd better wait.
We can't wait. It'll be months before they can mount an assault of the same scale.
- But, Knut, if we...
- It's our only chance.
If we win, those men won't have died for nothing tonight.
There were 50 of them and only nine of us.
- You won't even be nine.
- What do you mean?
I'm sorry, but I'm not going on such an impossible mission.
Oh, yes, you are, Rolf.
You're coming with us.
You're the only one who knows exactly where that dynamite must be placed.
Look, Knut, after what happened tonight, that factory's going to be jumping with guards.
- He's right.
- Now, listen.
Now, listen to me.
They have completely wiped out our entire assault force.
Right?
Now they'll be feeling completely safe.
You don't have a chance in the world.
Look, 50 men died tonight.
They came here to help us.
They weren't even Norwegian.
Now, who's coming with me tonight?
It's 11:50.
This is a military operation launched by the British.
We'll have British uniforms so the Germans won't shoot
Norwegian hostages afterwards.
The attack will take place at 3:15.
Arne, you and Henrik will be our cover party.
You'll move forward and cut a hole in the fence.
The actual demolition party will consist of...
The demolition party will consist of Knut, Oli and myself.
Jensen, inside.
Hello? Hello?
Be careful with those wires.
You'll blow the whole place up.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
Let's get out of here.
My glasses! My glasses!
I lost my glasses!
They're on top of your head.
Come on! Come on!
Well, gentlemen, your next mission is to find out how neutral Sweden is.
Especially the girls.
Where's Arne?
Down in the gorge.
Let's get going.
The Vidda'll be swarming with Germans in half an hour.
Excellent.
Excellent work, is it not, my dear Nilssen?
An extraordinaryjob, one might say, of sabotage.
Oh, naturally you had no knowledge of this.
Destruction. Sabotage. Waste.
All of this is against your thrifty, scientific nature, is it not, Nilssen?
In that case, answer me this.
How long will it take before production gets back into high gear again?
A year, at least.
First, new containers have to be built, a new store of heavy water accumulated, before production flows at full speed.
A year, he says.
What do you think we
Germans have been doing?
Sleeping?
What do you think your two friends from the Berlin Institute have been doing since they went home?
Playing golf?
Oh, the British fancy themselves very much after what they've done here.
Winston Churchill is puffing an extra-big cigar today.
And we laugh at him.
Why?
Because all these containers, which the British did so much to destroy, have already been pre-fabricated in Berlin.
They are already on their way here and will be installed by tomorrow.
That is, I must say, that is fantastic efficiency.
Don't you ever make the mistake of underrating the Germans, my dear Nilssen.
By Easter, we will have not merely 10,000 pounds of heavy water, but 12,000 pounds of heavy water.
Because from now on, no one leaves this building, not you or anybody, unless it's to go to
Grini concentration camp, where all suspect employees are being sent.
But I absolutely protest against this.
Protest as much as you wish.
But get used to the idea.
You built this place.
Well, you will now work in it, eat in it and sleep in it until our victory.
Heil Hitler.
Major Frick, this is one of the most disastrous security breakdowns of the entire war, and you are responsible for it.
I leave you in charge of the only factory in Europe making heavy water, and a dozen men in British uniforms calmly walk in and blow it up right in front of your eyes.
So, get up into those mountains and get back every one of those men.
Dead or alive.
And if it turns out they're Norwegians,
I want 100 hostages rounded up and shot.
I don't want even a rat left alive up there.
Go on, get out!
You say you can take us to them?
You'd better be telling the truth.
You keep your part of the bargain,
I'll keep mine.
You were right.
We should have shot that Quisling bastard.
Forget it.
Knut, go down that side.
Why?
Why?
My wife.
Your wife.
What the hell do you mean, your wife?
I made a bargain with the Nazis.
Who are you?
I was helping track down the saboteurs.
I got hurt in the foot.
Then you'd better come with us.
Saboteurs going to
Grini concentration camp.
I think I'd better go see my doctor.
Thanks for your help.
Hey, wait a minute.
We have a doctor right here now.
Come and see him.
I think I'd rather see my own, if it's all the same to you.
Oh, nonsense!
Our doctor will look after you for nothing.
Why pay a civilian?
Who is this fellow?
One of the men helping our patrols.
- If he's helping us, we must help him.
- Thank you.
That's only fair, isn't it?
Nasty. We'd better have that seen to.
I think we've got another passenger for your bus.
Doctor?
Do you remember me?
No, I don't.
We met at the university, Dr. Pedersen.
Afraid you're mistaken, ma'am.
You know this man?
No. I thought I did, but I don't. No.
You know him.
What did you say his name was?
No, please, I don't know him.
His papers say his name is Kristansen.
What was it you said his name was?
His name!
My name is Dr. Rolf Pedersen,
University of Oslo, as Gestapo headquarters no doubt will be delighted to confirm.
Doctor.
I'm so sorry.
Pederson.
Pedersen, not Pederson.
I'm very proud of my name.
Here, let me help you.
Here, oh, here it is.
Pedersen, Rolf.
Doctor of physics, believed escaped to England. England!
Well, even the Gestapo can be wrong sometimes.
How long will it be, Doctor?
I've got to leave here.
Do you hear me, Doctor?
I can't stay here long.
I don't know who you are, and I don't want to know.
But if you leave here, you'll be arrested.
And so will I and my staff.
You will, therefore, please stay here until I make the arrangements.
Anna, I told you
I don't want you using that transmitter set.
I'm trying to contact London.
They must know where Rolf is.
I can't risk it.
Why don't you go out and try to find him, then?
Because I'm not a member of the Missing Persons Bureau.
I can't jeopardize the whole operation.
I'm a bad ex-wife, Knut.
Why, because you love him?
Yes.
You haven't much use for that, have you?
Not in this sort of war.
It softens you up.
But sex, now that's something different.
It seems Rolf makes the same distinction.
But you don't, do you, Anna?
I'll get some wood.
They're in this area somewhere.
Leave that alone!
It's not for anyone, do you understand?
That transmitter remains silent until I give the order.
Now, you see, Anna, that's what I was talking about.
Morning.
Hello, Doctor.
A friend of yours is here.
Room 7, down the corridor.
Sigrid!
Hello, Dr. Pedersen.
I thought you were locked up in the factory.
We are, unless we're very ill or having a baby.
There's something that
I've got to tell you...
Nilssen found out you were here.
Listen to me.
- I've got to tell you about Arne.
- I know.
The Germans have installed new containers, so heavy water production is at full level again.
Sigrid.
When can you deliver the message?
Right now.
We've got to contact London.
Why? What's the matter?
The Nazis have completely restored heavy water production.
What?
Instead of two years, it's taken them two weeks.
We're right back where we started.
Then we'll have to bomb.
I'm afraid we'll have to take his appendix out.
In that case, one of our security officers must remain with him, day and night, until he leaves.
Then I shan't be lonely.
By the way, Doctor, how are Sigrid and her baby coming along?
Oh, excellent.
As a matter of fact, she's bringing him here this afternoon for a checkup.
I'd love to see her.
No one is allowed to communicate with Nilssen, Doctor.
"67 civilians killed.
"Factory virtually untouched.
"The Nazis..."
Well, the Third Reich is going to last for a thousand years.
Well, let's all go down into Rjukan, have a good Nazi dinner
- and see a nice Nazi film.
- Rolf.
Let's start getting used to it.
"The Nazis are shipping their entire stock
"of heavy water to Germany
"by rail and ferry
"under the guard of
1,000 picked troops.
"The railway tank cars
"will leave the factory
Saturday evening,
"be placed on the Hydro ferry
"Sunday morning."
And Nilssen had to lose a perfectly good appendix to deliver that message.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Maybe now, at the very moment we've all dreaded, when they take the stuff to Germany, by ferry, this is where we finally get them.
But, Rolf, 1,000 picked troops.
But there's one place you can't use 1,000 picked troops.
Knut, do you want to do a little dying with me?
I've just thought up a nice way to go.
It left at 9:00.
Yes, and it's got to be the deepest point, at least 300, 400 meters.
Now.
You know what we're talking about?
Yes, we're talking about murder.
Why two clocks?
If one doesn't go off, the other will.
It'll sink the ferry in less than a minute.
It has to be done, Anna.
It's all been calculated, hasn't it, Rolf?
Nothing left to chance.
Not even the hope that one of the children on that boat isn't going to drown.
Now, look, Anna, try and get it into your head, what counts is not who is going to die on the ferry, but how many millions will be saved if the ferry's sunk.
A nice equation, Rolf.
Put it on the blackboard and sign it.
It's not a nice equation.
And I didn't invent it. It exists.
So do people, Rolf.
People exist, too.
What the hell are we doing here if it isn't for people?
You don't do things for people, Rolf.
You never have.
Look, Anna, this work is tough enough even without you.
One day, after the war, a woman is going to come and ask why her child had to be drowned.
I won't know the answer.
It's as simple as this, we have no choice.
What are you going to say to that woman, Rolf?
We'll radio the Norwegian government in London, tell them the plan, all its risks, the Prime Minister, the King, the whole lot.
Then, if they approve, at least we've shared the responsibility.
It works.
Let's contact London.
Number one truck reports a contact on 2-4-7 degrees.
Contact 73 degrees.
West, southwest.
Not more than six kilometers from here.
All right. Heini!
Shut that door, will you?
That's better.
I'm glad you think so.
Stand up!
If we're not back in two hours, don't wait for us.
If you hear any shots, leave immediately.
How many do you want?
Come on.
There's nine minutes left.
You'd better go on to the boathouse with Knut.
Where are you going?
I've got to see that the ferry leaves on time.
Then I'll cut across the point and join you.
Be careful.
I will.
The explosion time is 9:45.
We won't make a move until then.
- Tickets.
- I'll have to pay.
Tickets.
Sigrid. There you are.
Hello, Doctor. What a nice surprise.
I want you to understand...
I don't think you've met little Arne.
There we are. There we are.
Sigrid, listen to me.
Sigrid. So, you've met a friend, eh?
Yes. Oh, this is Mr. Sandersen and his wife and their little boy.
Sigrid, I've got to talk to you at once.
Why don't you come and join us over here?
- Alone.
- I can't.
- We've brought some sandwiches.
- Would you excuse us, please?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Sandersen.
What on earth's the matter?
Sigrid, I want you to start a children's game at the back of the boat.
- Game?
- Now, as far back as you can.
What sort of game?
Well, let's call it life jackets.
Everybody puts one on when I say go.
The winner gets a bar of chocolate.
Now what...
Hello, there.
Excuse me.
Doctor, if you're in some kind of trouble...
Sigrid, do as I tell you.
There's not much time.
Let's organize the children now.
Come on, children.
Where is Rolf?
It's only a couple of minutes.
If he doesn't come in time, we'll have to go out and do what we can without him.
I don't want to play.
Oh, sure you do, you want to play, sure you do.
Don't forget, the winner gets a bar of chocolate.
Now, you ready?
Oh, your doll's cold.
Ready. Set. Go.
Sigrid's onboard the ship. And Rolf.
Rolf's there, as well.
But I don't want to play.
Look, you're gonna play if it's the last thing you ever do.
Get it.
I've won! I've won!
Mummy! Mummy!
Mummy!
If it was only your word, Lucila,
There would be doubt.
Caesar must be undoubted Caesar.
Is it not possible, Lucila that there are
Other ways of becoming the real heir of Marcus Aurelius?
Hail, undoubted Caesar!
Hail Comadeus!
Hail Caesar!
Hail Comadeus!
Hail Caesar!
Hail Comadeus! Hail Caesar!
Hail Comadeus!
I will never forget what you have done today.
Let this be heard over the four corners of the empire
That I Comadeus,
Now Caesar
To proclaim Galius Matheus Levius
Commander-in-chief of all Roman armies.
Proconsul of the Roman empire,
Second only to Caesar himself.
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
Remember, thou are mortal.
Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar! Hail Caesar!
In these buildings
You store all the law,
All the writings of the great men of Rome.
I am leaving with
My husband.
And soon I'll be far from this city.
Now I ask
That you guard these
The meditation of my father
Marcus Aurelius.
Whatever has happened
In the days to come.
Let not this be destroyed.
For this is Rome.
When...
When my father was dying,
I spoke to the gods,
Saying...
I am not like my father.
And if I'm to be crowned Caesar,
I would change all he did.
I offered them my life,
And told them that if it is not for the good of Rome
That I be Caesar,
Then let me be killed.
But you see...
I'm alive.
And Caesar.
Now!
I wish to see Rome once more... the city of light.
Gaiety, the beauty and strength.
We will have games.
The people of the city will be fed.
You & your Eastern provinces will send us
Twice the grain they've been sending
The taxes on them will be doubled.
My lord, Caesar.
This cannot be done.
We have famine,
Not only in our provinces of
Syria and Egypt,
But also in Armenia, Cappadocia
Arabia
In the whole Eastern half of the Roman empire,
People are dying of hunger
When the words spread that
You have sent for us,
It was joy and hope. Our people said,
Rome cannot let us die.
Our Caesar will send us help.
If we carry out these orders,
We risk having the entire East
Rise up against Rome.
You will tell your provinces,
Egypt, Syria,
The entire Eastern half of the empire
That if there is a least resistance to my orders,
I will destroy them.
You will also let them know they must forget
The weakness of my father.
The tribe of Polybus and his legions
Dead march, ambushed.
Barbarians. Human sacrifice. Romans.
Attack!
Balimar! Balimar!
Lay down your weapons and swords.
We have fought each other long enough!
You will never drag me,
And my people to the streets of Rome as slaves.
Balimar!
You or your people will never be slaves!
This I pledge you on my honor!
Caesar will never accept this.
They are prisoners of war.
They must be sold as slaves.
Let us die killing Romans!
Put them in chain! Put them in chain!
So we can talk to them as men.
We are asking only that you give us your words,
And your chains will be removed.
You don't seem to understand.
Galius Matheus Levius
Wishes to remove your chains.
He wishes to make free men,
Free women of you.
Wishes to make you Romans.
Is it that you doubt the word of Levius?
Tell me, I want to help you.
This is Voltran,
Our god of war.
If your gods are stronger than ours,
They will give you strength.
If they are not, you will reach out and touch Voltran.
You are surrounded by Roman soldiers.
At my first scream they will fall upon you and kill you.
We have lost the battle,
Voltran says we must die.
Let us look upon this logically.
You wish to know
If our god are stronger than your god.
One, what will you know if
I touch your god.
What if it's I am weak?
Two...
We wish to help you,
To free you.
If I scream you will all die.
Although I've been a slave,
I'm not accustomed to pain.
All I am is a philosopher,
I am weak.
I'm not worthy of it.
Barbarians!
Monsters! Animals!
Touch Voltran then will know
If your gods are weak.
I cannot,
I cannot bear this.
It's beyond all human endurance.
I cannot.
Oh, Levius.
What a world to
The future rested in such as this.
I have no intention of turning...
My faith was not strong enough!
You did not even scream.
There's no reason to take our god.
That's no reason to change your ways.
What do you want with us Roman?
You miserable, uneducated, half men.
You are not taught of what we fought for
And yet...
We want you.
We want you.
Sister!
If he hasn't been Caesar,
He'll be the greatest gladiator in Rome.
Yes! You do belong in the arena.
You mean to say you me all this way to sharpen your wits.
Everything you do has a purpose.
I came to tell you what your friends dare not.
You are pushing our Eastern provinces to rebellion.
Now I see.
You've come to scold me.
And may I remind, my sister.
That her younger brother cannot be order about and ridicule.
You seem to forget that I'm Caesar.
I do as I wish.
Do you? Do you?
You had only one idea,
To smash and destroy everything father did.
You always resented me, Lucila.
Why?
What have I ever done to you?
It's what you are doing now!
You're lying.
Don't you suppose I know that it was you
Who poisoned father against me.
I did not have to.
The problem is you and the cruel things you did.
How is it that you never knew about the cruel things you did,
Especially to our own mother.
I was in the room when she died.
When our mother died...
Remember!
I heard her beg you.
Lucila,
Why do you hate me so.
If I'd done anything to hurt you,
Forgive me.
And you let her die without a word.
Wasn't that cruelty?
There was a reason.
Reason?
What was it tell me?
Nothing.
Tell me.
Tell me!
Caesar!
You are unarmed.
Even a woman with a dagger
Could be dangerous.
She has no dagger.
She is my sister.
Leave us.
So, you came to warn me.
No other reason.
Didn't you know Levius
Was on his way back to Rome?
I did not know.
Do you know why he is coming?
Stay here with me, Lucila.
We'll find other ways to show the loyalty
Of Armenia.
Galius Matheus Levius.
I heard a whisper that
Lucila is here in Rome.
I do not heard him saying that anything is possible now
That Comadeus has become Caesar.
I've been hearing these wild rumors
That you've come with your head full of ideas,
For a new Rome.
Rome of my father.
I let you intend to come before the Senate.
With these ideas
These wild schemes of yours.
What will you do if I were to say, Levius
I don't want you to do it.
Just that. Nothing more.
I would still do what I believe must be done.
Abandon this plan, Levius.
And I will see to it that you and Lucila can always be together.
Oh, Levius.
Oh, what will I do?
I'm not as strong as I thought I was.
I have not learned to live without you.
There is no life for either us apart Lucila.
I told you this before but you would not listen.
I thought you betrayed my father.
But now I know.
You found your own way of making the world you want.
And yet if I try to make that world,
Comadeus will keep us apart.
Make that world. Levius
And let's see,
What will keep us apart.
Hail Levius, conqueror of the German.
Hail Levius, Germanigan!
Honorable fathers
And Senators of Rome.
Have you heard what is being proposed?
Galius Matheus Levius,
Have asked that we the Roman Senate
Should give
These barbarians,
These savages
Roman citizenship and settle them on Roman lands.
To treat these wondering murderers
As brothers,
Equal.
And what about other provinces?
What of Goule? So loyal to us.
What of Syria,
And Egypt which send us our grain?
If we make Roman of these barbarians,
Can we withhold
Roman citizenship from them?
No! Then what becomes of the precious price
Roman citizenship once was
It becomes a cheap, common thing.
It will be given away like bread.
I say no!
Warriors!
Let us rid our minds of these poisonous idea.
Crucify their leader.
Send the rest as slave
Teach them once and for all what it is to make war on Rome.
That...
Is the Roman way.
Honorable fathers of Rome!
You have greeted me as a soldier,
Who came in small triumph from the wars.
And I thank you for it.
But you will have a hard decision to make here today!
And it must not be I as a soldier
Swayed your vote.
I ask, therefore, of Caesar
That a man who's neither soldier nor senator,
But a philosopher.
A man of reason
Be permitted to speak for me.
Fellow Romans!
Greek! Greek!
Roman Greek have become a Roman by choice.
Slave! Slave!
I'm not a slave.
I want my freedom.
Fellow Romans.
I am a teacher,
And as a teacher I know that when I
Tried to teach the same lessons for a hundred times
And still the pupil does not understand
Then I force to conclusion that
Perhaps there's something wrong,
Other with the lesson
Or the teacher.
A hundred times we have taught
Those we have called barbarians
What it means to make war with Rome,
We burned their villages,
We crucified their leaders.
We've enslaved their young.
As far as go out to death and buried.
The slaves die, slowly.
But their hatred that we leave behind us
Never dies!
Hatred means wars.
Wars mean tribute
From our provinces,
Taxes,
Hunger,
Disease.
How costly that is!
How wasteful!
And yet the answer is simple.
We must have no war.
No war?
When your friends continually attack us.
This is treason!
These people have proved their aims
Very clearly.
To destroy us
And to destroy the whole Roman way of life.
And yet...
The answer is simple.
Let us transform my friends from men of war
To men of peace.
Let us put them on our abandoned farmland.
Not only will they produce food for themselves,
But this I pledge you.
One day they will send food to Rome.
Yes, I agree!
Put them on those lands.
Let them produce for us
But as slaves.
That is the way it has always been?
Neither here, we have twenty thousands
Of slaves in the family states.
Where are they now?
All sold or freed.
Why?
Because neither oppose to slavery.
No, because it is no longer profitable to keep slaves.
Slaves do not produce as much as free men.
Let us do what is profitable.
And right.
Let us share the greatest gift of all.
Let us give these men the right of Rome and freedom.
And they will spread the word
That Rome has accepted them as equal, then
We will have our human frontiers.
The Roman peace
That Marcus Aurelius promised.
In the name of Caesar...
In the name of Caesar!
Caesar has asked me
When has Rome ever been greater or stronger?
I say in answer to Caesar,
Never has Rome been greater or stronger than mow.
And what is it that has kept our empire together?
Our strength!
Our might!
Equality...
Freedom...
Peace.
Who is it that uses these words but Greeks,
And Jews and slaves.
Behind him and his people are the bandits...
Untold millions of them.
Waiting for a moment of weakness ready to destroy us.
If we take these barbarians and be amongst us,
Our enemies will say is it because
We are weak.
Then they will pour in to us from everywhere.
It will be the end of the Roman empire.
It will be the end of Rome.
End of Rome? The end of Rome?
How should an empire die?
Does it collapse in one terrible moment?
No. No!
But there comes a time when its people no longer believe in it.
Then, then! That an empire begins to die
Fathers of Rome,
I have lived under four great emperors
Trageon,
Henum,
Antonitus
Marcus Aurelius
When during all those years our empire grew.
Changed.
There all life is grow or die.
And you, the senators,
Are the heart of Rome.
It is through you that the people speak.
Speak up! Let the world hear you!
Let the world know
That Rome will not die.
There are millions like them waiting at our gates.
If we do not open these gates they will break them down
And destroy us, but instead,
Let us grow ever bigger,
Ever greater.
Let us take them among us.
Let the heart of the empire grow with us
Honorable fathers.
We have changed the world.
Can we not change ourselves?
Yes!
It is time to change! An end of war.
End to war!
Levius.
Oh Levius.
You have won.
We have won.
We have won the Senate.
We have yet to win Rome.
Rome is with you.
The armies are with you.
I'll be with you.
March against Comadeus.
With you as Caesar all Rome will change
You think you have defeated me,
Haven't you?
Since it was for Rome it cannot be your defeat.
It is also very clear now,
Why you came.
To destroy me.
I could kill you, both!
As for the Senate...
If you will try to oppose the will of the Senate...
I will not oppose the will of the Senate.
We'll allow your barbarians to settle,
But you,
You are no longer second in command to Caesar.
You will return to your northern frontiers,
And you will patrol them forever.
Until it is my pleasure to change my mind.
No, no, no, sister.
I'm not giving you anymore chances to prop against me.
You will go back to your husband in Armenia,
And you will not see Rome or Levius again.
A few days ago,
You were ready to make peace with Rome.
Over these half years we have made many peace treaty.
But many have died.
Of the northern people only you were left.
If you are afraid of the hordes of bandits on your frontier,
Rome will protect you.
Why did you refuse?
Why? Speak out clearly,
Now!
Or be on your way.
All these years in this wilderness.
What have we accomplished?
The first time in the history of the Roman empire
Boast of the northern peace.
And that could be a long, months, years.
For that moment has come.
That one moment that is too much
Would that moment would come
If Lucila were here with you?
A command from Caesar.
Your ought to return to Rome.
Themonitus,
Look! It's Levius!
All is well without you.
We prosper.
They have a home, like the Roman.
As you can see there's more than enough for ourselves.
You were right, Levius.
There's no limit what could be done
With the human spirit, for good or evil.
Have you heard from Lucila?
No.
I haven't heard a word, not for months.
I hear there's a famine I Rome.
People are dying in thousands of hunger
And pestilence.
I must get there before night fall.
I'm glad you prosper.
Terrible day, isn't it Levius?
I'm afraid the gods are angry.
They are torturing Rome with this
Pestilence
Thousands have died. I am alone.
I have no one to...
To turn to,
Except you.
I have not wanted to be away.
The entire East of Babel,
Arabia,
Judea, Cappadocia, Syria,
Egypt... Syria and Egypt!
That is Marcelus' and Versilana's...
They were among the most loyal.
Yes, to my father.
The army is against me,
Against Rome.
Even Sir Hamas has joined them.
He has forced Lucila to flea with him Levius.
Where is the Eastern army, Comadeus?
They have sided with the rebels.
There's only the northern army left to crash them.
And you,
You're the only one they will follow.
Levius.
Take command.
Do not give me this power, Comadeus.
The gods are all with me.
They will always be with me.
Go to the East and crash this rebellion.
Do not give me this power.
I'm not afraid.
You asked for this meeting!
Speak!
You are prepared to do battle with us,
Even before you have spoken to us.
You have rebelled against Rome.
Marcus Aurelius spoke of an empire
Of equal nations.
Rome will not tolerate rebellion!
We're old friend, Levius.
You are traitors!
You have caused two armies to mutiny!
You have threatened the empire!
We are not alone in this, Levius.
Levius.
Levius. Oh Levius.
The gods were kind to us.
They sent you. You. You.
You're a part of this, Lucila?
I am a great part of this.
Why a rebellion?
We are breaking away from Rome.
We will make our own empire with these
An Eastern empire.
An Eastern empire! You will make chaos!
What will hold you together?
What will you do to divide the empire?
But not if you'll join us, Levius.
We will have all Rome greater than ever.
What have you done, Lucila?
I am trying to prevent a disaster
My brother has set upon.
They may be wrong of what Comadeus has done,
But this is not the way to oppose him.
I cannot let you destroy the empire!
Cannot!
Cannot!
If you cannot then take your army back to Rome.
Let us make our own destiny here.
And let the rebellion go on unpunished!
I am part of this rebellion!
I am beginning to wonder if you ever love me.
It is out of love that I dared so much.
Run, Lucila.
Hide somewhere now before it is too late
Because as certain as death,
We'll fall upon the rebellious army and crash them
I do not run, Levius.
Who the hell is he trying to kid??
Hello? Hello, Abbeville?
What? But if you cannot place them, advise Paris!!
I'm at my winds end, but carry on.
Reinforcements, sir?
Why don't you cut out the clowning?
- Me, sir? What have I done?
- Don't ever let me see you... doing a victory roll over my airfield again.
I thought it would buck up the civilians.
For God's sake, Jamie, give your brain a chance.
Corporal, refuel them immediately!
Yes, sir.
So anyway, he hit me and made me nose bleed...
Corporal, I don't mean with your blood.
I gave him a couple of socks...
And re-arm them.
Yes, sir!
Hello, Harvey. Where's Jumbo?
Posted missing last night.
You acting C.O.?
Oh, yeah. Of what?
Five serviceable aircraft.
No spares. No contact.
First we knew the bastards would overrun us... was when we tried to land.
But yes, I hear you very well.
Eh? What?
Are you sure?
They are at Sedan?
For the benefit of the uneducated among us...
I shall translate.
Archam can't believe that Sedan's fallen. I can.
It's no use. They'll be here in half an hour.
We must leave immediately.
Yes, let's get the hell out of it.
Where to, sir?
Why don't you follow me and find out? Come on, idiots.
After you.
Unless they've got there before us.
Get that buzzard out of here!
We'll go with what we've got!
All right.
Forget your kit. Let's move.
Get all the transport you can and get the men out of here.
All N.C.O. S report to me immediately!
You know what to do with the lame ducks?
Yes, sir.
Bombs away.
All the yanks, over here!
Load 'em up!
Over the wing.
Flood the cowling.
Plenty of it.
Right! Stand clear!
Into the trucks!
Come on!
We haven't got all day!
"To the permanent
Secretary of State for air...
"Sir, I have the honor to refer to the very serious calls...
"which have recently been made upon fighter command...
"in an attempt to stem the German invasion...
"of the continent.
"I hope and believe that our armies may yet be victorious...
"in France and Belgium...
"but we have to face the possibility...
"that they may be defeated.
In this case...
I presume that there is no one who would deny...
"that England should fight on...
"even though the remainder of the continent of Europe...
"is dominated by the Germans.
"I must therefore request...
"That not one more fighter be sent across the channel.
"If the home defense is drained away...
"in desperate attempts to remedy the situation in France...
"defeat in France will involve the final, complete...
"and irremediable defeat of this country.
"I have the honor to be, sir...
"your obedient servant,
H.C.T. Dowding."
Air Chief Marshal Dowding, sir.
You do realize, Dowding, the position this puts us in?
I realize that the French have been promised this squadron.
By Churchill personally.
He's given the French prime minister his word.
You do appreciate, Dowding... that Churchill will have to see this?
That's why I wrote it.
This is the BBC home service.
Here is the news.
In the House of Commons this afternoon... the prime minister,
Mr. Churchill, said...
"What General de Gaulle called the Battle of France is over.
The battle of Britain is about to begin."
Eyes right!
I welcome you in the name of the Second Luftwaffe, General.
Thank you, thank you,
Kesselring.
- My dear Fink.
- General.
Everything all right?
We are ready, General.
We can start.
Very well, gentlemen, then forward.
Attention!
Eyes right!
Call out the guard!
Call out the guard!
Attention!
If I have to inspect one more bomber...
I won't recommend you for a Field Marshal, Kesselring.
Please, may I finish the inspection?
Certainly.
Sir.
Pleasant return journey.
The English are not ordained by fate to be our enemies.
You heard it yourself,
Jeschonnek.
This time he's wrong.
They are completely finished... done for.
We'll never have a chance like this again.
Absolute nonsense!
Nonsense, do you call it?
It's a pure catastrophe.
Herr Baron von Richter.
The Fuehrer will speak to you now.
My dear Max!
How lovely to see you back in Switzerland so soon.
I came straight from Berlin an hour ago.
The ambassador will see you now, sir.
Thank you. Excuse me, please.
Sir David,
I'm again instructed... to emphasize that the Fuehrer wishes... to avoid further bloodshed.
England is not our natural enemy... and he offers guarantees for the British empire... if you give Germany a free hand in Europe.
Goering and his Luftwaffe would like to flatten London... as a prelude to invasion.
It's two lumps you take, isn't it?
What's left of your army... abandoned its weapons at Dunkirk.
You're defenseless and just playing for time.
We know of the moves you're making in Washington.
We know the Americans won't be drawn in.
Their embassy in London gives you two weeks.
So what's stopping you?
Look, David. The Fuehrer is being very reasonable.
He offers guarantees.
Experience shows the Fuehrer's guarantees guarantee nothing.
What about Churchill?
After our last appeal, what do we hear?
"We will fight them on the beaches."
With what?
Winston gets carried away sometimes.
With liquid courage.
That's what they tell me.
Clearly, you don't know him.
David, we are not asking for anything.
Europe is ours.
We can walk into Britain whenever we like.
If you think we're going to gamble... on Herr Hitler's guarantees, you're making a grave mistake.
All those years in England seem to have left you none the wiser.
We're not easily frightened.
Also, we know how hard it is for an army to cross the channel.
The last little corporal to try it came a cropper.
So don't threaten or dictate to us... until you're marching up Whitehall!
And even then we won't listen.
Heil Hitler.
It's unforgivable.
I lost my temper.
The maddening thing is that he's right.
We're not ready.
We're on our own.
We've been playing for time.
And it's running out.
Silly bitch!
He's calling you names again, Harold.
I spent half a week settling her and the kids in the country... and now,
"I'm bored," she says!
One of your elite trying to land without wheels.
Boomps-a-daisy.
It's enough to make you weep.
And welcome home, sir.
Undercarriage lever a bit sticky, was it, sir?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it was.
Well, I wouldn't tell the C.O.
That, sir, not if I were you.
You can teach... monkeys to fly better than that!
I'm terribly sorry about that, sir.
- It won't happen again.
- Keep your jacket on, boy.
How many hours have you done in spits, Simon?
On spits, sir? 10 1/2.
We'll make it eleven before
Jerry has you for breakfast.
Spring chicken to shite hawk in one easy lesson.
Attack, attack, attack...
This is Rabbit Leader.
Are you receiving me?
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
Red-3 on 3.
Receiving you loud and clear.
Right. I'll try and get on your tail... and I want you to take evasive action. Understood?
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
Red-3 on 3. Understood.
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack...
Hello, Rabbit Leader.
I thought you might come in from the sun.
Don't think. Don't just glance.
Look! Search for the bastards!
And never fly in a straight line, or you're a dead duck.
- Sir.
- Now, let's try it again.
Or, in other words, beware of the Hun in the sun... who, for reasons best known to himself... has confined his recent attacks to our channel convoys.
However, this won't last forever.
But it has given us a chance to pull ourselves together... and to train people like you.
As fighter controllers, you'll be joining an organization... which, thank the good Lord... was not rushed up hastily yesterday.
It'll be a pain in the neck to the enemy when he comes.
It's the joker up our sleeves.
Now, the R.A.F. Chain shows us where they are.
The information is passed to group... group scrambles the necessary squadrons... and you, at sector level... guide our chaps to the interception.
It's been tried and tested.
It works.
So don't blame the system if you're no good.
Now, clearly, 11 Group here... will bear the brunt of the battle... as those of you who are posted there... will find out to your discomfort.
12 Group is our second line of defense... and covers the industrial midlands and the north.
13 Group, Scotland and the northeast... and 10 Group, the west of England.
More than half the fighter-command squadrons... are stationed here at 11 Group... near the coast where we expect the invasion... and also able to protect London... which is as far as the bombers can get with fighter escort.
But I think we can leave strategy... to those with egg on their hats.
Attention!
Please, gentlemen, the Inspector
General has just arrived.
Here.
Thank you, Captain.
Ah, my dear Foehn.
You are well?
- Yes, thank you, General.
- And Falke?
Yes, thank you, General.
May I introduce my brother Hans, sir?
Another fighter ace perhaps?
When I get the chance to fight, General.
General.
We have borrowed this.
- Dover?
- Dover.
Those masts are their radio direction finders?
Yes. Their secret weapon.
Which we captured at Dunkirk.
Our Stukas can deal with them.
Excuse me, General, but why?
If they know we're coming, so much the better.
We don't have to look for them.
The pilots are in excellent spirits, General.
I have eyes in my head,
Osterkamp.
I merely wanted to say,
General... we shouldn't wait too long.
It may happen sooner than you think.
Please, gentlemen.
Come, Falke.
Thank you, General.
This delay is an incredible piece of luck.
I mean, they roll up France and then stop.
They could've come right on.
You know, our latest intelligence... is that Herr Hitler is sightseeing in France.
'Tis rather pleasant weather.
Oh, no, I mean it.
He's on holiday.
I'm not complaining, Minister.
No, no, no, seriously, Dowding... the morale factor is vital.
I saw Beaverbrook on Monday.
Now, he's going to be able to deliver... as many as a hundred fighters a week.
Well, after seeing you...
I want to be able to go back to the cabinet... and tell them you're as confident as I am.
Damn it, man, we've got 650 planes.
And they have 2,500 aircraft, haven't they?
They won't all come over at once, and we have radar.
Churchill puts great faith in radar.
It's vital, but it won't shoot down aircraft.
I must say, you don't exactly exude a spirit of optimism.
God willing, we will hold out, Minister.
I see. So I tell the cabinet... that you're trusting in radar and praying to God... right?
More accurate the other way around.
I'm trusting in God and praying for radar.
But the essential arithmetic is that our young men... will have to shoot down their young men... at the rate of four to one if we're to keep pace at all.
It's the oil pressure, sir, but the gauge is being checked.
- All right, Charlie. Carry on.
- Thank you, sir.
Never give up, do you, Charlie?
Instrument check, sir.
I hope your new C.O.
Believes you.
He's going to be one of your headaches now.
They know the orders... don't tangle unnecessarily.
So it's "May I do an engine check, sir?
"Or an undercarriage check or a radio?"
Any excuse to get at the Jerries.
At least it shows they're keen.
Yeah, they're a good bunch.
God knows what I'll find in Scotland.
A lot of kids with down on their cheeks.
Yeah, training them to be fighter pilots... is a damn sight more dodgy than fighting Germans.
Well, you've got to earn that new stripe somehow.
At least I got three days in town.
Give my regards to your wife.
Thanks.
May I have a word, sir?
Send us back a haggis.
If you want permission for a test flight... the answer is no.
Large scotch, please.
You with that lot down the road, sir?
No.
One and six, please.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Have you applied for that post in Scotland?
- Darling, I can't.
- You can't.
You know I can't.
- You mean you don't want to.
- Can't. I've got a job.
What have we got?
What the hell is this?
Is it a marriage or a flaming air force committee?
For God's sake, Colin, don't start that all over again.
I knew this would happen.
I never wanted you to join up... never.
Colin, please, try to behave as if I were a human being.
You look more like a parade-ground suffragette to me.
I'm just not cut out to wave a wet hankie on sooty stations.
For God's sake, who's asking you to?
We'll be in Scotland together.
I never could stand marching women.
You couldn't care less, could you?
I cared enough to come here fifty miles.
I didn't measure it.
I did.
I even booked a room.
Three days.
It would be marvelous.
Are you going to apply for that posting or not?
Left, right, left.
Right, left, right, left, right.
Squad, halt!
Right turn!
Order arms!
Now, wait for it.
Squad... dismissed!
Come on, Albert, you're not dead yet.
- It's his turn.
- You'll be lucky.
Twelve pints, please, Fred.
One for the sarge.
Let him get his own.
No, sir, it's not Charlie.
It's some Hurricane out of juice very likely.
Right. Call me directly you hear anything.
Well, somebody must have spotted him.
He can't just disappear.
All right, I'll hang on.
Sir, it's
Air Vice Marshal Park.
That's all we need now.
Jamie, hang onto this.
Good afternoon, sir.
Tell your men to relax.
How are they making out,
Canfield?
Half the squadron are new pilots, sir.
That's why you were sent here, to lick them into shape.
They get less warning here than any other station... so they must learn to get up from standby... in two minutes flat if they're to intercept the enemy.
Hello. Dispersal.
Right.
Stand down, "A" flight.
Yours?
Yes, sir.
The chaps spoil her.
All right, Canfield, what's up?
You have a pilot missing.
Yes, sir.
Over the channel.
Is he much overdue?
Over two hours, sir.
I thought I'd made it clear we're too near the enemy... for pilots to go swanning around on their own.
We can't afford to lose them this way.
What's the excuse this time, undercarriage check?
Instruments, sir.
We've all done it, but that's no excuse.
What's his name?
Pilot officer Lambert, sir.
Gerhardt, my bath!
Yes, certainly, Major.
Do me a favor. Not now, Papa.
These are the day's instructions for the Luftwaffe...
- and they must go off today.
- All right, if I must.
I know, you have just found it.
That doesn't concern you.
Hurry up, old man... because my evening meal will not wait for you.
In exactly five minutes, we drive to Boulogne, OK?
Hans, look after Major Foehn.
Good evening, sir.
May I lead the way?
Certainly, my boy. Lead on.
Don't let him near the wine cellar!
What's the best way to evade a Spitfire, Major, shallow dive?
And curving in at the same time.
But excuse me, Major, my brother says... a Spitfire can outmaneuver a 109.
When we are in England, let him take up a Spitfire... and prove it to me in my 109.
Done! But don't forget your life jacket!
I said look after our guest,
Hans, not drown him.
Major Foehn doesn't think much of the shot-method.
If you would teach your boys to shoot a little sharper... the problem wouldn't arise.
Excuse me, Jafu II.
You are to report to Wissant.
- What, now, Papa?
- Immediately.
And Major Foehn also.
I think I know why we've been asked to go to Wissant.
This is it.
Gentlemen... Eagle Day!
The destruction of the Royal
Air Force on the ground.
Zero hour for takeoff 7:15 A.M.
Our targets today in southern England... are the following airfields.
Manston, Biggin, Kenley...
Dover, Hawkinge.
It is our task to destroy the R.A.F. On the ground.
There'll be nothing left for us.
Don't worry, gentlemen... our omnibus drivers won't be able to destroy everything.
Some Spitfires will remain, anyway.
Even for you, Bruno.
Therefore, gentlemen... fly in at maximum height and make good use of it.
And try not to land in the Channel.
Especially use your eyes and watch your petrol gauges.
Remember, you've only got thirty minutes over there.
Come on, chaps.
Away, I'm here.
Hostile 2-3.
Morning, all.
Bearing 1-8-6, range thirty miles.
Twenty plus.
Height, six thousand.
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.
No I.F.F.
Hostile 2-9, now thirty plus.
Yes, Danmoor, I confirm.
Recheck I.F.F., please,
Bentmarle.
Sorry to call you in, sir, but something's building.
2-8 now forty plus.
Convoys?
None due through until tonight, sir.
Hostile 3-1 forty plus, 1-6.
Better bring more squadrons to standby.
Right, sir. Get me Beacon Hill.
Reconfirm Hostile 2-3.
Hostile 2-3, 1-8-0.
Getting interference again, sir.
Not now, corporal, not now.
That's better.
Five miles.
I'm afraid the raid is entering my ground range, Danmoor.
Stukas.
Get them up.
43 Squadron, intercept Hostile 2-1.
That was Danmoor, sir.
Ventnar radar out of action.
Who's covering Dover?
54 Squadron, sir.
6th Squadron's airborne, sir.
Too slow. Some of them took six and seven minutes.
They'll have to do it in two.
Tallyho, Velvet Leader!
Down there on the left.
Stukas!
Roger. Here we go.
Attacking now.
Yellow section, keep your eyes peeled for the escort.
Spitfire!
Easier to hit than a barn door.
It's like shooting rats in a barrel.
You'll be in a barrel... if you don't watch out for the fighters.
What's the matter?
Can you hear me?
Ventnar, and now Dover's out of action.
- Our plots are drying up.
- Then we're blind.
So now we've only got the observer corps.
This is only the beginning.
They won't stop now.
Heinkels.
Make it a hundred plus.
Hello? Hello?
Heinkels, hundred plus.
Yes, Center. Still going north.
Height?
Twelve thousand.
Dispersal.
2 Section, scramble!
Look alive!
Engine trouble!
Lookout.
Right.
Muck and filth everywhere,
Mr. Warrick. It's like a pigsty!
The cooks don't come on till 6:00.
Well, you've got some defaulters. Put them onto it.
Come on you lots, move!
You'd be there fast enough if it was real!
At the double!
Oh, my God.
Section Officer Harvey!
Sir.
I've noticed that some of your girls... are now using the men's trenches during air raid practice.
- It's got to stop.
- Sir.
And another thing... gas mask cases... they're for gas masks.
They're not handbags.
I do realize, of course, that female requirements... differ somewhat from the male.
Nevertheless, that's no excuse to...
God's teeth!
Take cover!
Bastards.
At least we know what Jerry's going for.
All our airfields, unfortunately.
It's a squadron scramble, sir.
Don't be wet.
Get me the duty controller.
We've only just come down.
We're still refueling.
Don't just stand there!
Get one up!
Corporal Johnson!
Engine blocks away!
Rest of you men, in the trenches!
Talk about a hairy takeoff.
- I saw Jimmy buy it.
- Did Archie get off?
Oh, I'm with you old boy, but I've left my stomach behind.
Ah, shut up, will you!
Rabbit Leader to Cowslip Control.
Do you read me? Over.
For Christ's sake, Cowslip, wake up, will you?
Rabbit Squadron airborne.
Close up, Red-2!
Stick to me like glue, Simon.
Rabbit Leader, sorry about that.
This is Cowslip.
About time, too.
Where'd they go?
Bandits now twenty miles east of you heading southeast.
Sector 1-2-0 and make Angels 2-0.
We'll go, Cowslip.
Rabbit's turning port... now.
Come in, Red-2.
Where the hell are you?
Where the hell are you, Simon?
You, lads, pull yourselves together!
Get moving!
Get another shovel!
Bates, pull yourself together.
Stay with them, Seymour.
It's all right. I'll see to it.
How about two hands over here, Officer?
Run the hoses out over here!
Put that cigarette out!
The mains have gone!
Can't you smell gas?
Don't you yell at me,
Mr. Warrick!
Here, you men!
Don't stand there looking at it, you idle shover!
You! Get me some stretchers and the orderly.
- Ma'am.
- Fast!
You can stand some of the girls down now, Corporal.
Jones, Whitman, clear up that mess.
Then you can take five minutes.
43, stand down.
1-1-1 released.
5-0-1 are down at Tangbear.
They couldn't get in at Big Wing.
Few more days like this... and we won't be able to get them down anywhere.
I suppose we could always pull them all back... north of the Thames, out of range.
That is precisely what they want us to do.
This is the BBC home service.
Here is the 9:00 news.
Large formations of enemy aircraft... today attacked targets in southern England... but the enemy's aerial armada came in for heavy punishment.
Over forty-seven German planes were destroyed... with a loss of only fifteen of our own aircraft.
Six of these pilots were saved.
Several R.A.F. Aerodromes were also attacked... and some casualties were sustained... but they were light.
Colonel.
Good. Very good.
The weather is constant.
We have a stabilized high pressure zone... and we'll make use of it.
The proof, gentlemen.
We are destroying... as many planes on the ground as in the air.
Thank you, Schmidt.
On the desk, please.
Reichsmarschall Goering will certainly be interested... in my report.
To date, almost 300 planes have been destroyed.
Almost half the entire British fighter force, gentlemen.
The Colonel can report what he pleases.
The fact remains... that our bombers continue to be intercepted.
Because the English are now bringing in their reserves.
As from tomorrow, we'll increase our attacks on these airfields.
And five Luftwaffes will attack the north and north-east.
But that is outside the range of our fighters, Colonel.
Also outside the range of the English fighters.
Not even a Spitfire can be in the north and the south... at the same time.
How far are we from the coast?
Everybody, Action Stations.
Tomato Heinz to all.
Tomato Heinz to all.
Another ten minutes to target.
All ready at Fighter Stations.
Another ten minutes to target. End.
Look! Spitfire!
Help yourself, everybody.
There's no fighter escort.
There! Right behind us!
Soapbox Leader, break it off.
Home and tea.
For once you deserve it.
Well done, everybody.
Heinkel, three-second burst.
Starboard engine.
Ruddy great flamer.
Any identification marks?
Yellow stripes on the wings.
Wing leader. See it go down?
Did I? Nyaow... plunk!
Hmm. Graham and Jack will confirm your story.
That's three of you who got him.
1/3 of a kill, laddie, 1/3.
Sir.
- What did you hit?
- A Heinkel.
- Anyone see mine go in?
- Didn't know you were with us.
Well done, Peter.
Only 1/3 of a one, sir.
Oh, that's better than nothing.
I used to blast away and never hit a sausage.
One thing though...
What's that, sir?
It takes us two years to train people like you.
Suppose your controls had been damaged.
What would've happened to that idiotic victory roll?
You'd have been spread all over the damn field... like strawberry jam.
Never again. Clear?
Yes, sir.
Something to make Stuffy's day.
The old man's just gone down to the OPs room with Sasha.
Final figures of the northern raids... twenty-three without loss.
Jolly good.
I'll show it to him.
Right.
We're getting 6 volunteer pilots from Coastal Command... and from the Fleet Air Arms, sir... five from each of the Fairday battle squadrons... and three from army cooperation.
That's thirty, is it?
Not enough.
We lost that many yesterday.
And the air staff hesitate to weaken the light bombers... in case of invasion, sir.
We need pilots now.
What about the foreign squadrons under training?
Czechs, Poles?
I know your feelings about the language difficulties.
They don't understand a word that's said over the air.
They're a menace to themselves and us.
I'll try and cut more corners off the training program.
Pilots are doing well... enemy losing at the rate of two to one... then he can afford to, can't he?
Never sends more than half his bombers at one time.
We must find more pilots... or lose.
Begin. This is off speed.
Check 5-0-1 back at ready desk...
I think you ought to see this, sir.
Thank you.
Air raid warning.
Sector Three Red.
Rabbit Squadron.
Tallyho, tallyho, Red Section.
We'll take the rear starboard.
Yellow, you take the port.
Yellow-1 Wilco.
Tallyho, Yellow.
Amaliel, keep your eyes open for the Red Squad.
Rabbit Leader, Red-3, you're on those bastards...
Six o'clock high.
Coming down now.
Roger, Red-3. I see them.
Rabbit, brave right and climb.
Behind you, Andy! On your tail!
Get out, Andy!
Jump!
Hurry up! Out!
All out!
Don't any of you Joes talk English?
Corporal!
Sir!
Where are you taking those vultures?
Officers to the mess, ensigns to the guard room, sir.
Like hell you are. They're responsible for all that.
- Get them to clear it up.
- But what about the officers?
Give them a bloody shovel.
Come on, step with it!
Skipper hates Jerries.
He'll hate me if you don't get that gun repaired.
Then wrap up this little lot.
Only eight for the morning?
Got to do better than that.
Five are write-offs.
One has another guard gone, and two are missing, sir.
Mr. Anthony and Sergeant Moore.
And these two are hundred-hour checks.
They've been at it for 48 hours solid, sir.
I know.
Where the hell have you been?!
Learning to swim.
- Do your best, Blaine.
- Roger.
You get one?
All I got was a bellyful of English Channel.
When are you going to learn?
I didn't know they were there.
Never fly straight and level... for more than thirty seconds in the combat area.
How many times have I told you?
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I'd rather walk, sir.
Cut out the "sir."
You called your wife?
All right, boy. Get in.
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
It's ridiculous!
We go up four or five times a day... and every time we come down, more potholes.
There are more potholes until we can't bloody well get in a door.
We'll get this place operational again.
You won't. Not until someone decides... to protect it while we're up.
What flaming genius thought of sending us... to that dump of a flying club?
Don't blame me.
Direct orders from group.
Park himself.
It's not a bad little field.
I've seen it. Damp tents... and a nasty little shack full of dead flies.
At least you won't have the Jerries visiting you.
I don't blame them.
How much longer, Hobbes?
The engine's overheating, and so am I.
We either stand down or blow up.
Which do you want?
Hostile 1-6, reconfirm, please.
Need some more
Yellow sevens, Flight.
This is R-29, now forty plus. 1-5.
Yes. 2-6 and 4-1 detected, sir.
7 Squadron's airborne, sir.
Thank you. Let 12 Group know.
And make sure they know... they're protecting my airfields while they're up.
- They have been told, sir.
- Tell them again.
Pine Tree Leader, this is Turkey Control.
Vector 1-9-2.
I have some trade for you over Maidstone.
Turkey Control,
Pine Tree Leader.
Roger 1-9-0.
Pine Tree, this is Turkey.
Twenty plus bandits and Angels 2-0 heading west.
Roger, Turkey Control.
Indiana left.
Making low level attack.
Roger. I see you.
I'm breaking left to attack.
My God!
Fighters coming down now!
Fire speed. Break.
Break!
On your tail, Jamie.
Enemy aircraft approaching, sir.
Coming straight for us.
Flying course, 21st.
About eight thousand feet.
I'm taking cover.
Tin hats, everybody.
That should damn well never have happened.
- Where the hell is 12 Group?
- They were requested, sir.
They're nowhere in sight.
Find out what the devil they think they're playing at.
They just fell on us.
They got my number two and the C.O.
You saw Canfield go down?
It blew up.
Just blew up.
- Bad as we thought?
- Worse.
Kenley and Biggenor are shambles again... and the rest are not much better.
God knows how many aircraft we'll have in the morning.
All because 12 Group didn't do their stuff.
Leigh-Mallory and his so-called Big Wings.
Might as well stay on the ground for all the use they are.
We were up, sir.
Trying to knock out the enemy en masse.
But it takes time to assemble 40 or 50 aircraft at 15,000 feet.
It takes far too long.
By the time your Big Wing is up... the enemy have hit their targets and are on their way home.
All that matters is to shoot them down in large numbers.
I'd rather destroy fifty after they've hit their targets... than ten before.
Don't forget the targets are my airfields, Leigh-Mallory... and you're not getting fifty.
You're not even getting ten.
Gentlemen, you're missing the essential truth.
We're short of two hundred pilots.
Those we have are tired, strained... and all overdue for relief.
We're fighting for survival.
Losing.
We don't need a big wing or a small wing.
We need pilots.
And a miracle.
Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.
And now, over to the Savoy Hotel, London... for dance music until midnight... with Carrol Gibbons and his Savoy Hotel Orpheans.
You look a damn sight better out of uniform.
Hardly remember you out of yours.
And who's fault's that?
For God's sake, not again.
Look, damn it, my squadron's come south.
You just apply for that posting!
Colin, no!
All right, agreed!
Taboo subject tonight.
Old wafs.
You really think we're solemnly going... to get into these ridiculous garments?
Not at this stage, surely.
I'm shy.
Oh, Maggie, come on.
It's just...
I am shy.
Honestly.
I'll put out the light.
No, Colin!
No, it's not just bed, it's us!
It's you.
And me.
You and me.
We should have been over target nine minutes ago.
The wind has veered.
So where are we?
Where is London?
Far back in the south-west.
Good. Then get rid of the bombs and let's go home.
Colin.
I will put in for that posting.
Promise.
That's their bombs!
They're bombing London!
It isn't funny! Cut it out!
Too damn close.
Colin, I promise.
I promise.
Attacks on London are strictly forbidden.
This order you know as well as I do, Major Brandt.
These attacks may only be flown... on the specific order of the Fuehrer.
I regret, gentlemen... that this is now completely out of my hands.
By order of Vice Marshal Goering... you two are to report to Berlin to testify.
Thank you.
Major Brandt?
Flying Officer Froedl.
Please follow me.
Would you believe it?
Don't they know there's a blackout?
You know what Goering said:
"If ever a bomb falls on Berlin...
- "you may call me Meier."
- Hmm.
You are to report to Colonel
Schroeder at 9 A.M. Sharp.
This car will take you to your quarters... and you are to remain there.
"As from today, we are called Meier."
Last night, bombs were dropped on Berlin by the British.
So be it.
That is a game at which two can play.
If the R.A.F. Drops three, four... five thousand kilograms of bombs on Germany in one night... then in one night we shall drop three hundred... four hundred, five hundred, five thousand on England!
When they attack our cities, we will flatten theirs.
Then we will obliterate them!
The hour will come when one of us must crack.
It will never be
National Socialist Germany!
Never! Never!
The English are wondering.
They keep asking,
"Why doesn't he come?"
Be patient. Patience.
We are coming.
We are coming!
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!
Attention!
Reichsmarschall, I welcome you in the name of...
It's all right, Kesselring.
Thank you, thank you.
Ah, Osterkamp, everything all right?
Yes, sir.
Then it can begin.
- Come with me, Kesselring.
- Yes.
Don't stand around like a bunch of pigs!
Fall in!
I'll let the lot of you swim over the Channel!
Attention!
In the ditch! March!
Get off the road!
Attention!
There they come.
If we lose the war now... they'll tear our arses asunder.
Arrow to Rabbit Leader.
Vector 1-6-0.
Bandits one hundred plus.
Angels 1-5.
Bandits one hundred plus. Over.
Rabbit to Arrow.
I can't see them.
But they must be there.
Well, come have a look for yourself then.
Nothing, I repeat, nothing.
Group, please.
Everything we've got, and get them moving.
They've caught us this time.
They're turning northwest.
It looks like London.
It's London, all right... and we've got everything up covering airfields.
Where is the Royal Air Force?
- Messerschmidt.
- Iron Corps.
Messerschmidt!
No, they ain't.
They're Iron Corps.
Five seconds.
Away!
Away!
The pressure's dropping again.
This is as far as I can get, lad.
Down at the end there, by that car.
- Hey, no you don't.
- What do you mean?
There's a thousand-pounder down there... and it's not gone off.
If you're looking for somebody... they're all down at the church hall.
They got the Rose 'n' Crown.
He'll have to drink at the Red Lion now.
If they'll have him.
How bloody stupid can you get?
I spend half a leaf seeing you all safe in the country... and you bring her back to all this.
I'm sorry, it's just we missed everyone.
You're all going back.
Dad, have you finished it?
Have you got it?
Thank you.
There's a family trapped in Shaw Street.
Can we have some more volunteers?
I'll be back, luv.
Stop that bloody bell!
It came more from the back.
Not real Spitfires.
They couldn't land here.
You'll see in a minute.
Only officers fly Spitfires.
You're not a fighter pilot.
What about your top button?
Anybody can do that.
T-5? What's that?
They're a training squadron, sir.
The Poles.
Get them out of it.
Get them down.
Blackhawk Leader, vector 2-3-0... and return to base immediately. Over.
Blackhawk Leader.
Received and understood. Out.
Blackhawk Leader to "A" flight.
Turn to port and steer 2-3-0.
Germans! Germans, on the right!
- I don't see! Where?
- Down there on the right!
I see the Jerries. I see!
Stop that Polish chatter and steer 2-3-0.
Repeat, please.
I say again, 2-3-0.
Repeat, please.
For crying out loud, 2-3-0!
- Repeat, please.
- Repeat, please.
Now, just shut up, the lot of you, and follow me... unless you're blind as well as...
Oh, God's truth.
Shut up!
Silence, in Polish!
Get out quickly!
One, the R.A.F.
Is not a flying circus.
Two, strict R.T. Procedure will be observed at all times.
And it is never... repeat, never... to be used... for private Polish chitchat.
Finally, and God alone knows why...
I've received the following signal.
"Congratulations. As of today, this squadron is operational."
Signed, "Keith Park...
"Air Vice Marshal,
A.O.C. 11 Group."
I was wrong about the Poles.
We also have the second
Polish squadron, sir.
I thought you'd mention that.
All right.
Make them operational.
And the Canadians?
And the Czechs.
We need them all.
Looks like London again, sir.
Yes.
And there's nothing we can do about it.
But if Goering should concentrate... on London by day... it's another matter.
If it means he leaves my airfields alone...
I shan't complain.
Even a few days would give me the chance... to get back to full strength.
He'll have farther to come.
And to go back.
We'll have more time to intercept.
What's more important, Park... his fighters have only fuel enough... for ten minutes over London.
His bombers will lose much of their protection.
For the first time... they'll all come within the range of 12 Group.
Perhaps now, at last, we shall see... what Leigh-Mallory's
Big Wings are made of.
Turning on London could be the Germans' biggest blunder.
Spider Leader, this is Top Hat Control.
Bandits now twenty miles east of you, heading southeast.
Vector 1-2-0.
- Make, Angel 2-0.
- Roger, Top Hat.
Fox Trot Leader, this is Tango Control.
Fox Trot Leader,
Pass your message.
I have some trade for you building up over green "A."
Roger, Tango.
Spider Leader, Top Hat Control.
Your customers appear to be splitting up.
Main course heading for London will be your target.
Vector 0-9-0.
Roger, Top Hat.
Batman Control.
Climb to Angels 1-9.
Roger, Batman.
Thank you again.
This should give them something to think about.
Starlight Control to Dogtail.
Keep an eye out for a friendly wing... joining you on your port side.
Roger, Starlight.
I see them. I see them.
Bloody marvelous.
Fox Trot Leader, Tango Control.
Bandits now probably slightly below you.
Roger, Tango. I've got them.
Peewee Leader turning starboard now.
Watch out for 109s about.
Roger, Fairfield Leader.
Going up now.
Take the left-hand pair,
Blue Leader.
Roger.
Everybody else, keep tight.
Swarms of them, sir!
Fox Trot Leader, cut that out.
Everyone keep quiet.
Leave the flaming fighters.
It's the bloody bombers we want.
Ox, will you pipe down?
On fire, son of a gun!
Ox! Behind you!
Behind!
I am on fire! I'm bailing out!
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon my ass, you Boche bastard.
Put your hands up!
Come on, put them up!
What is it?
I'm a Polish pilot...
Cor blimey.
Your mitts, mate... your mitts.
Put 'em up there.
Go on. Get going.
Where are you taking me?
I'm fighting on your side!
Can we get in?
- And fetch the doctor.
- Good.
I know, young man.
Get out of the way, man.
It's coming. It's coming.
Are you telling me that your losses are critical?
We're bombing day and night,
Reichsmarschall.
Our losses are high, and our pilots are tired... and the planes need servicing.
Be specific!
What are you telling me?!
The English have changed tactics.
Changed tactics? How?
They are attacking in large numbers.
Our losses might be reduced if our formations... were more closely escorted by fighters, sir.
The fighters are always there.
But not close enough, is that it?
You, yourself, were a fighter pilot.
The fighter is a hunter, sir.
I was a fighter pilot.
I was not a coward!
There is no suggestion of cowardice, sir!
I am making the suggestion!
From now on the fighters will stay close with our bombers.
And lose their natural advantages... of surprise and speed?
You will obey orders!
The invasion cannot begin until we have cleared the skies.
Come, my friends,
I have chastised you enough.
But I am here to help him.
Is there anything you want?
Foehn? Falke?
Yes, sir, a squadron of Spitfires.
Stop... vapor trail.
Left and above.
Vulture Leader to everyone.
Keep quiet. Hold positions.
We'll encircle them only when they close up... to firing distance.
We'll take the rear starboard.
Yellow, you take the port.
Roger.
Thanks awfully, old chap.
Sir, you know...
I have promised the Fuehrer... to clear the skies and totally destroy the R.A.F.
I expect to be obeyed!
Here we are.
The miracle of the loaves.
We should have moved in here before we were bombed.
Maggie, I'd like you to meet our new assistant controller.
Squadron Leader Tom Evans,
Section Officer Harvey.
How do you do?
Hello.
He knows your old man.
How is Colin?
Haven't seen him since my little escapade... with the burning Hurricane.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am. There's a call for you.
Will you excuse me just a minute?
- Yes.
- Thanks.
It's around the corner.
Hello?
It's me.
How on earth did you get through here?
Put it down to rank.
I said I was an old battle-ax from the Air Ministry.
Colin. That was very clever.
Any news?
About?
Your posting, you silly idiot.
Well, you've applied.
I've been so busy here.
It's really not as simple as all that.
Look, why the hell not?
To be absolutely honest,
I forgot.
I know, darling. I'm sorry.
Groopy's here now.
I'll go and talk to him right away. All right?
All right?
Colin?
Colin?
Get through all right, sir?
Yes.
Let me give you a piece of advice.
What's that, sir?
Stay single.
Are you still with me,
Dogtail Red-2?
Affirmative, Red Leader.
Directly behind you and on your starboard side.
What happened to Harvey?
He got a 1-0-9, then ran into trouble... but he's all right.
No mistake.
I saw him bail out.
Right, right, attention.
Right. Stand at ease.
Corporal Seymour will detail you to your various watches.
I left out the bit about the wolf whistles.
You're better at that.
The troops have other things on their minds nowadays... thank goodness.
Right! Shun!
It's Colin.
He isn't dead, Maggie.
He's going to be all right.
They can do wonders nowadays, you know.
It's just a question of time, that's all.
We'll get you a posting so you can be near him.
Is he badly burned?
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Peter. I want you to take over Red Section.
Who are my numbers two and three, sir?
A couple of new lads.
They're outside.
Right, then.
How many hours on spits?
- Ten, sir.
- Seven, sir.
Stick to me like glue and keep your eyes open.
Control. Put out 2-2-2 and 6-0-3 Squadrons... against Hostile 2-6.
Winston would pick a day like this to come.
Is everything up?
The lot, sir.
- Reserves?
- None.
That's what I've just told the prime minister.
Red-3, this is Red-1.
Much closer.
I can hardly see you.
Red-2.
You must keep up with me.
Right, Red Section. Here we go.
Stick to me like glue.
Red-3, behind you!
Come in, Blue-2.
Hey, kids. Shut up, will you?
This is the BBC home service.
Here is the 9:00 news... and this is Armand Adell reading it.
Up till 8:00 tonight...
165 German aircraft have been destroyed... in big scale attacks attempted by the enemy today... on London and the southeast.
We lost thirty fighters with ten of the pilots safe.
Buckingham Palace has been bombed again... but no one was hurt.
Yes? Yes, one moment.
It's the air minister, sir, on the scrambler.
Yes?
Dowding. Look, our people in Washington... are having trouble with the American press... and it's about today's figures.
German sources there are saying... that our claims are wildly exaggerated.
Hello?
Are you there, Dowding?
I'm here, Minister.
Well, can you verify the figures?
I'm not very interested in propaganda.
If we're right, they'll give up.
If we're wrong, they'll be in London in a week.
- Morning, Arnold.
- Morning, sir.
Morning, sir.
- Morning, Arnold.
- Morning, Clyde.
Dispersal.
Right.
Tea's up.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
They are late this morning, sir.
The bastards are up to something.
Quick march!
You have let me down!
You have betrayed me!
THIS FILM WAS AWARDED THE
MAX Upholds PRIZE IN NANTES
YOUNG TÖRLESS
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY ROBERT MUSIL
Cinematography by FRANZ RATH
WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY
Beineberg, please keep an eye on my son.
You can count on me, sir.
That's a relief. I trust you.
Something solid and decisive about you won me over instantly. Cigar?
Thank you, sir.
I wish my boy were more like you.
He always seems so insecure, so unbalanced.
I have no idea what he'll amount to.
I'm glad to have met you all.
And knowing our son is with you makes saying good-bye easier.
Especially since he's found such good comrades.
Gentlemen, please contact us immediately should anything happen to my son.
What could happen, Dad?
You understand, Mr. Beineberg?
Absolutely, sir.
My child.
What else could I do?
He sleeps with her, and the next morning she takes him ashore.
But after a while, he couldn't eat fish anymore -
- Watch it, idiot!
- Leave me alone.
What are you hoodlums doing here?
Go ahead, take one.
- Man, they're hot!
- Come here, my dear.
- Here, my boy.
- Thank you, pretty lady.
God be with you, child.
Stop fooling around.
Hi, sweetheart.
Is our little boy homesick?
Ah, the young gentlemen.
Come and sit with us.
- Something to drink?
- Wine. Four glasses.
No, eight. This round's on me.
Thank you.
Would you gentlemen like to play, or are you afraid of losing?
Here. I'll bet 20.
- You lose.
- My tough luck. C'est la vie.
DAYS SERVED
Yet another day to tell our grandchildren about.
What's that, Tress?
Well?
I meant this was another memorable day for us.
Since it wasn't exciting enough for you... you'll copy out Horace's sixth ode for tomorrow.
Reiting, I was supposed to pay you back today, but could you give me a couple more days?
Sorry. I need the money now.
Didn't you receive your allowance?
Sure, but I've got other debts too.
I owe Beineberg and
Tschusch from last month.
Go begging to them. I'm not one to wait in line.
Of course not. You're my friend.
You shouldn't have gambled away the money.
I wanted to double it.
My last word on this subject:
Pay me back tomorrow or -
Or?
Or you'll be subject to my terms.
What sort of terms?
You give me your allegiance in everything I do.
If that's all, I'll do it gladly.
I'll stick by you.
But not just when you feel like it.
You must do whatever I say.
Blind obedience, as it were.
Well?
I'll bring you the money tomorrow.
Quiet, please.
"Eight-year sentence for murderess.
Wilhelmina worked in a coffee house in Graz until she was 19.
Then she met Günther
K., an army deserter, who introduced her to prostitution and made her work for him.
Asked by the judge why she had done it, she replied, 'Because
I was under his spell.
That night, when Günther took me to the Wiener Strasse to work,
I said, "I don't feel like it today. "
Günther then said,
"Then sleep with me. "
I didn't want that either.
I resisted, so Günther beat me up and was really angry.
Then I had to kneel down before him and worship him like a god so he'd be good.
That night, I shot him in bed. '
Gross Sankt Florian:
One of the oldest parishioners, retiree Franz Braunecker, was unexpectedly called from this mortal life at the age of 91."
Miss, bring us two orders of venison, coffee cake and slivovitz.
How much time do we have?
Two and a half hours.
What's for dinner tonight?
Beats me. Some Sunday swill, I'm sure.
Tell me, Beineberg:
What do you want to be?
I don't know.
But I won't be a civil servant or officer, that's for sure.
First I'd like to travel around and earn a little money without committing myself to a profession.
Then maybe I'll go to India or Asia.
I've got a few ideas.
I have no clue myself.
Don't know what I'm good at or what I'd enjoy doing.
I feel I know myself and the world less every day.
Because you're a nutcase.
Often I just want to run away.
But you'll never do it.
You hightailing it!
That'd be the day.
The monotony here is killing me.
Of all that we do in school, what makes any sense?
Where does it get us?
We're here to develop our minds and prepare ourselves.
We'll live later.
Prepare? Develop? What for?
Here you are.
Where did you get the money?
I borrowed it.
Who was stupid enough to lend you money?
Hoffmeier.
Look, Basini, why lie to me?
Maybe you can pull that with others, but not me.
Hoffmeier himself asked me for money this morning.
But Beineberg complained his money had been stolen.
In a nutshell, you took the money from Beineberg's drawer last night.
How dare you say that!
What a nasty thing to say! That's vile slander!
You're just picking on me because I'm weaker.
You're angry because I won't grovel.
You want to blackmail me, but you picked the wrong guy!
I'll tell the whole class of your accusation.
I'll go the principal.
Let's go. It's on me.
Thanks. Especially since my money was stolen last night.
Really? Any suspects?
No, not yet. But he'll be sorry if I catch him.
I only did it because I was in need.
I would've put it right back.
Please don't tell anyone I stole it.
I just borrowed it in secret. I'll -
I'll do anything you say.
Just don't let the class know.
Don't tell them.
So you'll accept my conditions?
Yes. I'll do what you say.
Good. I'll think it over.
Where to now? Bozena's?
Yeah, that's what we agreed.
You don't want to pay, eh?
Get the hell out of here, you swine, or I'll deck you! I'll tear you to shreds!
The dirty scoundrels want a good time but don't want to pay!
What's going on here?
Good evening.
What sweet boys have come to see me?
Come on, be quiet.
Have a seat.
Nice of you to visit me.
Or did the man in you bring you here?
Ah, be quiet.
What fine lads you are.
Don't be shy, boy.
Take a good look.
Your friend acts like he's never seen a woman in his life.
His mother is quite a stunning woman.
I saw her recently at the train station.
I'm sure she turned many a head in her younger days.
Do you still have some slivovitz?
You know where things are here.
Thank you.
Why that bored look?
She'll think you're afraid.
- Let her.
I'm not in the mood anyway.
You don't like me talking about your mother?
You people always think you're better than us.
You don't think your mother and I are alike, huh?
You think you're better than that?
You're wrong.
Terribly wrong.
I know your families better than that.
I spent enough time in Vienna.
I know what goes on there.
"My dear Bozena" here,
"my dear Bozena" there.
They were always very nice to me.
Until they noticed I was pregnant.
You should have heard them talk.
Not to my face, of course, but among themselves they spoke of nothing else.
And Madam -
She wore an expression as if she drank nothing but cologne.
But soon after that, her cousin's belly swelled out past her nose.
And did anybody know that baby's father?
No.
Just as well.
I left for his sake.
I don't want to go back. I'd rather die than work there again.
Is this yours?
Thank you. Nice of you.
Sometimes I wonder why I let you guys in.
Certainly not for a couple kronen.
You and him and the other one.
What's his name?
Reiting?
No, not him.
Basini?
Yeah, Basini. That's who I meant.
He's a strange boy.
You're all the same.
You belong together.
When your parents are around, you don't know me.
As soon as they're gone, you sneak right back to me.
You're just like your parents.
Hypocrites... cowards and liars.
Where'd you get the broken nose?
You know who you remind me of?
My brother. I broke his nose.
It's funny how much better a man looks with a broken nose.
What's wrong with that boy?
Homesick.
Poor boy.
And the naughty little boy comes running to someone like me?
Well, what is it?
Give me a kiss.
See?
You're still alive.
And it's better than what you do in your dorms.
- I've got him.
- Who?
- The thief who stole from Beineberg.
- Tell me!
Nobody knows yet.
- A servant?
- No.
Give me a hint.
Basini?
What's wrong?
Be careful!
Here's your money.
And here's the knife Basini broke into the closet with.
What do you think we should do with him?
Basini is a thief.
Yes, a thief!
And thieves are punished all over the world.
He must be reported and expelled from school.
Let him fend for himself out in the world. He doesn't belong here anymore.
No. Why rush to extremes?
It's not all that bad.
How can you say that?
You want to go on living with someone who's stolen?
Someone who's offered to be your slave?
Aren't you exaggerating a bit?
You act like we're sworn to brotherhood for life.
Nothing ties us to Basini, except that a lot of pleasure could be had from him.
Pleasure?
Look, Reiting.
Why do you keep standing up for Basini?
Standing up for him?
Is that how it looks?
I don't know.
Again, a gross exaggeration.
What's with this idealism?
This enthusiasm for the purity of the institute.
It's so virtuous and so boring.
Or do you have some special reason?
Some old grudge for which you want Basini expelled?
Then come clean with it.
We're on your side.
Nonsense.
What do you think?
I say do what you want with him.
In India they'd cut his hand off or drive a sharp stake up his bowels.
At least that would be amusing.
Hold out your hands.
Which hand did you steal with?
We've decided not to report you... this time.
You'll be under our supervision, and you'll have the chance to reform.
From now on, we will strictly scrutinize your income and expenses.
Dealings with the rest of the class will be subject to our consent.
Do you agree?
Do you agree now?
Yes.
Quiet, please!
Mail call, boys.
Canitz.
Basini!
From my Dulcinea.
Now you'll see.
Did I promise too much?
You should have seen her corset.
I couldn't take that, of course.
The price tag's still on it.
You just bought it, you show-off.
- Did you get all that?
- What?
Those imaginary numbers.
It's very simple.
Just remember they're based on the square root of minus one.
Yeah, but that's the problem.
That doesn't exist.
The square of a number is always positive.
It's just a way of calculating these numbers.
But how can you, when you know for certain mathematically that it's impossible?
The peculiar thing is that you can actually calculate with these imaginary values.
For example, you can build a bridge using this kind of formula, one that stands firm, even though it was calculated using something that doesn't even exist.
Is there a gap in our reality?
You sound like that Holy Joe of ours.
The chasm between the body, which is made of matter, and that which it embodies, namely, the immortal soul.
Go ask our math teacher.
You want to know about irrational and imaginary numbers?
Please have a seat.
I'm glad, Torless, very glad.
Your doubts reveal a strain of serious independent thought.
But it's not so easy to give the clarification you seek.
Please don't get me wrong.
- Would you like one too?
- No, thanks.
How about a candy?
Look.
You spoke of the intervention of transcendental factors.
I don't know how you feel about this.
The supernatural, that which is beyond the strict bounds of reason, is a very peculiar thing.
I'm really not qualified to hold forth on these matters.
That material's not covered in my course. You can view it different ways.
I certainly want to avoid undercutting someone else's position.
But you should be able to explain mathematics for me.
Yes, as far as mathematics is concerned, a natural and purely mathematical context does indeed exist.
But as a good scientist,
I'd have to use hypotheses that you would probably not yet understand.
And then, too, we don't have the time.
And imaginary numbers?
You must get used to the idea that such mathematical concepts, entirely nonexistent values, are purely notional concepts necessary to mathematics.
Think about it:
At the elementary stage of your present instruction, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive explanation.
Fortunately, very few feel the need for it.
However, when someone like yourself
- and, as I said, I'm very glad - comes to me, I can only say,
"My dear friend, you must simply believe.
When you know ten times more math than you know now, then you'll understand it.
But in the meantime, just have faith.
Everything is about feeling, even mathematics. "
Always off in the clouds, eh?
What are you doing here?
Come along. You'll see.
- What's going on?
- Wait.
How's our great mathematician?
- How do you think?
- I get it.
What do you get?
He didn't tell you anything.
He put you off till later.
Then you'll understand.
The scales will fall from your eyes.
When they've "prepared" you down to their level.
I don't think you can say that.
You needn't tell me anything.
I know these people, stuffed full of formulas they learned by rote just like the priest learns his catechism.
Or do you think the world spirit would give these bloodless creatures a peek under her skirts?
He calls that watching over Basini.
What's going on?
Come to the room tonight.
- Reiting tricked us.
- I thought as much.
Oh, you thought, did you?
But you didn't notice it, of course.
No, not at all.
But I was watching closely.
You remember the story about what happened here four years ago?
- What story?
- You know.
That story.
- Oh, right.
Only in passing.
I only know there was a huge scandal over some obscenity and a whole lot of them were expelled.
That's what I'm talking about.
Reiting's doing the exact same thing with Basini.
You think Reiting is in love with him?
Of course not.
Reiting's no fool.
But it probably amuses him.
I never would have suspected Reiting of that.
Well, I'll show them both.
What do you have in mind?
I'll remind them of the others who were thrown out for it.
That'll give them a little food for thought.
But you can't report them.
And I don't want to.
I mean, I don't care about Basini.
But it's different with Reiting.
And what he's done puts him completely in my hands.
I think he'd be happy if he could get me somehow.
See what I can do now that I know this secret?
Sure, but -
One word from me and he's finished.
We've gotta do something.
You still think we should report Basini?
I'd prefer that we punish him ourselves.
The school would merely expel him and write a long letter to his uncle.
You know how businesslike that would be.
"Dear Mr.
So-and-so, your nephew has lost his head and been led astray.
We hereby return him to you.
All hopes for his success. "
And so on.
You think it means anything to them?
And what should it mean to us?
Well, maybe nothing to you.
You're gonna be a lawyer or a poet.
But I see my life differently.
I want to learn from this situation.
How do you mean to punish him?
It's not so much about punishment.
I've got something else in mind for him.
I'll just... let's say, torture him.
No need to be so startled.
What I've got in mind is pure asceticism.
To rise above this world, you must kill off everything that enslaves you to it.
Feelings, for example.
When I take Basini to task, I'll surely feel pity.
But that's inappropriate, because Basini doesn't matter.
Somebody who does the things he does isn't worth it.
So pity in this case is a completely senseless emotion.
A waste of life force, if you will.
I intend to kill off all these superfluous emotions in me.
Listen, what do you think of Basini?
What am I supposed to say?
He's a foul creature.
Isn't he indeed? Very foul.
You always get mixed up in crazy things.
Not at all. And what if I do?
You gotta try everything once.
And if he's really that despicable -
Tell him to come to the attic tonight.
You mean the room?
No, not yet. The attic.
All right. Shall we walk a little more?
Yeah. But I'm sure
Torless has things to do.
Ah, there you are.
Stay right there.
We've decided to sit in judgment over you.
The charges are as follows:
You've committed a break-in.
You've stolen money.
You've acted on your own, against our express wishes.
You've attempted to set us against each other.
You went over my head and placed yourself in Reiting's service.
What do you have to say for yourself? - Please, I -
Put your hand down.
Relax.
Aren't you ashamed?
Answer him!
You refuse?
What's wrong?
Are you crying?
Are you unhappy?
Come on, smile.
You won't, huh?
Then we'll give you a reason to cry!
Let me go!
Put the light out.
They'll see it outside.
What's wrong with you?
Isn't that like an eye?
You getting poetic on us?
No, but isn't it like an eye into some strange world?
Pure nonsense.
Kneel!
You thought you'd get away with everything.
You thought I'd help you.
You were wrong.
Please, I couldn't help it. For God's sake!
Silence!
We've had it with your excuses.
We now know just what sort of person you are, and we intend to act accordingly.
Now say...
"I am a thief. "
Are you deaf?
Say you're a thief!
I'm a thief.
That was smart of you, kid.
And now say, "I'm an animal.
A thieving animal.
Your thieving animal. "
I'm an animal, a thieving animal, your thieving animal.
- That's disgusting.
- Let the animal go.
Give it to me.
Damn it!
"I must be sick, insane.
Why else would things that others find normal disgust me?"
- Watch it!
- Open your eyes next time, you ass!
What are you still doing here? Aren't you leaving?
No. It's not worth it for just a few days.
We're only going to Sternberg's.
He invited us to his uncle's estate. Wants to get in good with us.
What are you writing, a book?
Secrets?
Go ahead, but you won't understand it.
Hey, he's writing about us. Listen to this.
"When I observe things dispassionately,
Basini's theft is a trivial transgression.
The way Reiting and
Beineberg punish him is customary cruelty among schoolboys.
But that doesn't explain it all.
This sober stance isn't enough.
A dizzying abyss suddenly opens before me. "
What do you think of that?
- Complete rubbish!
You can write what you want, but kindly leave our names out of it.
Come on! The car's waiting.
In the meantime, don't get too bored.
Go see Bozena and send our regards.
Torless, aren't you going home?
No, Professor.
What's going on?
Come to the room. I have to talk to you.
What are you doing?
I'm not gonna do anything. Put that back on.
Sit down.
Why did you start undressing?
- I thought - -
You thought what?
- The others.
- What others?
Beineberg and Reiting.
What about them? What did they do?
You have to tell me everything.
Even though the others already told me.
Well? Are you gonna do it?
Please don't make me do that.
Or is this your own special way of torturing me?
I don't intend to torture you.
I just want you to tell me the whole truth for your own sake.
But I've done nothing particularly worth telling about!
You're a pathetic coward!
Please don't say that.
You see what a coward you are?
You take it all.
They say if I'm obedient, they'll eventually forgive me.
Those two?
Everyone.
How can they promise that?
I'm involved in this too.
They said they'd take care of it.
Did they say anything more specific about how they'd do that?
No, just that they'd take care of it.
- What do they do with you?
- Who?
He's very friendly with me.
He usually has me read him something about Rome and its emperors, or Timor Leng, or Ivan the Terrible.
All those bloody stories.
Then he usually beats me afterwards.
- After what?
Oh, I see.
And Beineberg?
He's repulsive. Don't you think his breath reeks?
Be quiet.
Tell me, what does he do?
Same as Reiting, only in another way.
He preaches to me at length about my soul.
He has me sit down and stare at a glass until I'm sluggish and tired.
Then I have to get on the ground and howl like a dog.
What for?
I have no idea.
And you let them do all that to you?
You do what they tell you?
What else can I do?
I want to be a decent person again and be left in peace.
And what happened before doesn't matter to you?
I can't do anything about that.
Listen to me carefully.
How could you steal like that?
I really needed the money.
I owed Reiting money, and he wouldn't give me more time.
Nobody would loan me -
No, that's not what I meant.
I meant, how could you do that?
How did you feel? What went on inside you?
Nothing at all.
I didn't feel anything.
I didn't think about anything.
It just simply happened.
And the first time with Reiting?
The humiliating service you were too cowardly to refuse.
Didn't you feel torn apart inside?
Some indefinable shock, as if some unspeakable change had taken place inside you?
I don't understand you.
When they spit on you, make you whimper and eat dirt!
What happens inside you then?
Doesn't the image you have of yourself shatter?
Doesn't it shatter?
You're tormenting me. I don't know what you want.
There's nothing to explain.
It all happens in a second.
Nothing else happens after that.
You'd do exactly the same in my place.
Hey, Hungarian.
Sternberg's got a great cousin.
Hi, Torless. How's Bozena?
I didn't even go.
Wouldn't she let you in?
I'll swallow this worm for half a krone.
You're on.
The nerve of that guy.
Does he really think he's in the clear?
We've got to do something about Basini.
He's used to having to obey us. He doesn't mind it anymore.
He's getting chummy and fresh, like a servant.
It's time to take things a step further. You agree?
I don't know what you have in mind yet.
We've got to humiliate him further.
I'd like to see how far we can go.
How to do it is another matter.
But I just might have a couple ideas.
For example, we could tie him to a bed and whip him.
And then make him sing psalms of thanks.
It would be interesting to hear the expression in his singing, every note shrouded in fear.
But there's something else
I have in mind for him first.
Reiting, you may leave if you're too dumb to grasp something profound.
You recall our conversation about imaginary numbers?
We needed to find a way to overcome the inadequacy of reason.
This force that keeps logic together despite its gaps and shortcomings...
I call the soul.
I'd like to lure this soul out of Basini... by hypnotizing him.
Because of your unworthy conduct, you've lost touch with your soul.
You're about to find it again.
If you follow my instructions exactly, no harm will come to you.
But annoy me with the slightest objection... and I'll shoot you down.
Take this pendulum.
Hold your hand steady.
Observe the key carefully, and imagine it's swinging in a circle.
Look only at the key.
Concentrate on the key.
Imagine it making a circle.
You try to stop it.
But you don't succeed.
The key swings faster and faster with no help from you.
By my will alone.
See how strong my influence is over you?
Now sit down.
Do exactly as I say.
Empty your mind of all thought.
Stare at this little light... and don't blink.
Keep your eyes as wide open as you can.
Don't think about anything.
Focus all your attention inwards.
Your arms are getting heavy.
Your legs are getting heavy.
Your entire body is getting heavy.
Your eyelids are getting heavier and heavier.
As heavy as lead.
Your vision's growing dim.
Your eyes are watering.
Your thoughts are slowing down.
Slower and slower.
Stare inside yourself until you find the point where you feel only your inner self... free of all thought and sensation.
You are now completely numb.
Your body no longer feels pain.
You see?
He's in a trance.
Your soul has departed for its next existence.
It's no longer shackled by nature's laws, no longer condemned to inhabit a fleshly body.
Follow the candle.
Very slowly.
Further.
When your mind stands still, your muscles will let go too.
Your empty body may float through space.
Lean forward.
Further.
Further still.
Damn it!
Swine! You were only pretending!
Just wait! I'll show you!
Let me go!
Let me go!
I'll tell on you!
Cover his mouth.
Torless, I want to confess everything!
Torless, help me!
Don't go!
Help!
Torless, you've gotta help me.
I can't take any more.
They'll torture me to death!
I can't help you.
You were nice to me a while ago.
Don't speak of that. That wasn't me.
I can't take it anymore!
You feel you're suffering and want to escape, right?
Do whatever you like.
But look what they did to me!
What's going on here?
Are you meeting with Basini in secret?
He asked me to protect him.
- He picked the right person!
- And I might have, too.
But this whole thing bores me.
We'll teach you to make secret alliances.
Your guardian angel Torless will have his fun with you too.
No, Reiting, I won't.
- Just like that?
- Yeah, just like that.
I was looking for something before.
Second sight, eh?
Yes. And now all I see is brutality.
You should see Basini eat dirt.
You'd get a real kick out of it.
- I'm not interested.
- But you used to be.
Because Basini's condition was a mystery to me.
- And now?
- There's no mystery there.
Things just happen.
Anything's possible.
There's not an evil world and a good world.
They exist together in the same world.
That's the whole truth.
- Brilliant discovery!
- Sure, make fun of it!
But you're senseless, nauseating brutes!
Hold your tongue!
Dirty, thoughtless and disgusting!
I forbid you to call us names in front of Basini!
Forbid?
You think I'm gonna fight you over Basini?
I hear you've been bad-mouthing us, and in front of Basini too.
We'll forgive you this misstep just this once.
Come to the room tomorrow night.
We'll punish Basini and then hand him over to the class.
- Do whatever you like.
- But you'll be there.
No.
Why not?
You think we don't know why?
Think we don't know how involved you've gotten with Basini?
No more than you.
That's enough now.
If you don't show up tomorrow, we'll tell everyone you're Basini's accomplice.
Understand?
Basini, they're gonna turn you over to the class.
Report it to the headmaster tomorrow before they beat you to a pulp.
We've got a letter for you.
A nice surprise.
To Mr. Anselm von Basini,
Prince Eugen Boarding School.
From Mrs. Agatha von Basini.
Mommy dearest.
Read it.
"My dear son. "
The poor little thing.
"You know that with the little money I receive as a widow
I can't afford a lover!
"I have only a little left for you. "
Give me that letter!
Stop it!
Let me through!
This is crazy!
- You wanna protect him?
- Let me through!
Did you join in his obscenities?
Are you one of his lovers?
Let me go!
Let me go!
No! Let me go!
Let me go!
I can't take it! Stop!
- Hang him!
- Up on the rings!
Let's go!
What's going on?
Open up!
Swing him lower!
Yeah, lower.
Open up!
Open up!
My God, it's Basini!
That's downright diabolical.
It's unbelievable.
This is the door.
It's simple. We tell the teachers we didn't report Basini out of pity.
He mocked all our efforts to help him.
Yeah, we can all attest to that.
He was incorrigible and stubborn.
We'll say he kept getting into debt.
Which he could never pay back.
He shamelessly exploited our generosity and refused to heed our well-meaning advice.
We admit we made a mistake.
But Basini kept provoking us with his shameful conduct.
All our well-intentioned attempts to reform him were met with scorn.
We didn't report him only because we felt sorry for him.
Very well.
Do you have no explanation for why Torless suddenly ran away?
I noticed he'd been extremely nervous the last few days.
His extraordinary moral sensitivity must have made him feel guilty that, even though he knew about it all from the start, he didn't report it immediately.
What are your plans?
I'll go back to school for a couple of days.
Won't the teachers punish you for running away?
I don't care. I'm through with school.
I'll ask my parents to take me back home.
- How much?
- Three groschen.
Come with me.
Unbelievable.
Can you tell us, Torless, the reasons that led you to run away so suddenly?
We already know these things.
But tell us what led you to conceal Basini's crime.
I don't know, sir.
When I first heard of it, it seemed outrageous.
On the one hand, I told myself
I should report him to you.
And so you should have.
On the other hand, I wasn't interested in punishment.
I saw it from an entirely different point of view.
I was overcome by dizziness each time I -
You must express yourself more clearly, Torless.
For example, imaginary numbers -
Allow me to shed some light on this obscure reference.
Young Torless came to ask me about certain fundamentals of mathematics, including imaginary numbers, which are truly difficult for the untrained mind.
Yes, I said it seemed to me that we couldn't get to the bottom of that through logic alone.
That we needed another certainty, an inner certainty.
And I felt the same way about the Basini matter.
So you feel drawn away from science and towards moral, even divine, aspects?
Torless, is what the reverend says true?
Do you have a tendency to seek
- as you seem to be saying - a religious background to things?
No, that's not it either.
Then for God's sake tell us in plain words what it was!
We can't get into philosophical debates here!
I can't help it if it's not what you think.
Perhaps I haven't learned enough to express myself clearly, but I'll attempt to describe it.
Basini was a student like any other.
A perfectly normal person.
Suddenly he stumbled.
I'd thought of these things before - humiliation and degradation - but I'd never experienced them.
But it happened to Basini.
I had to admit it was possible that man wasn't created good or bad once and for all.
We all keep changing ceaselessly.
We exist only by virtue of our actions.
But if we allow ourselves to change to where we become torturers or sacrificial animals, then anything is possible.
Then even the most horrific things become simply possible.
Then there's no line between good and evil, and both merge imperceptibly.
Then perfectly normal people can do terrible things.
The only question then was, "How is this possible?"
To observe this, I let these things go unreported.
I wanted to know how it was possible.
What happens when a person humiliates himself or suddenly turns cruel?
I used to think it would mean the end of the world.
Now I know differently.
What seems so horrific, so incomprehensible from afar, simply happens.
Quietly and naturally.
Therefore one must be continually on guard.
That's what I've learned.
This young man is under such emotional strain that this school is no longer the place for him.
His intellectual nourishment must be monitored more carefully than we can do here.
I'll send his father a letter to that effect.
A peculiar person.
You think?
What's wrong, Thomas?
Nothing, Mom.
I was just thinking about something.

SAMURAI REBELLION
Do you want to try, Tatewaki?
Isaburo Sasahara of the escort group has tested it.
That's enough for me.
I see.
I'll tell the chamberlain you both approve.
I'd rather see you two duel than merely test swords.
There are rumors in our clan.
The reason you don't fight is because it would hurt the family of the loser.
You both understand that, and so you avoid a duel.
Be that as it may.
Perhaps protecting your family name rather than promoting your pride and rank is the wisest way to get along in this world.
Slicing straw dummies to test our lord's sword.
What peaceful times these are.
Now, now.
Think of it as one of our duties.
Isaburo, you're too attentive to your superiors.
I'm used to it.
I married into my wife's family and have been henpecked for 20 years.
Did anything unusual happen?
No, nothing at all.
Would you like to look at the November border record?
No, not if nothing unusual happened.
I'm returning to the castle with Sasahara.
Making rice cakes in November
But there are no customers
They're waiting anxiously for the Inoko festival.
Inoko?
Does that mean the Suwa Shrine festival begins tomorrow too?
The god who came down in February and brought the rice harvest departs tomorrow until his return next year.
Do you really believe that?
No, I was just -
The hearts of children are docile and precious.
They sing, believing it.
Perhaps you want a grandchild?
Yes, as soon as I find a bride for Yogoro.
It isn't settled yet?
No. My wife Suga is the problem.
It must be someone she approves of.
I keep quiet, but I'd like a nice wife for Yogoro.
Someone strong, loving and faithful.
Is that the steward's?
Yes, he just arrived.
He's been waiting for you.
Making the steward wait.
You were probably idly chatting away to Asano about useless things like martial arts again.
To have the steward honor us with a visit has never happened in the Sasahara family.
The truth is, Isaburo,
Lady Ichi has been dismissed from the castle.
Lady Ichi?
Yes.
It has been decided to have her marry Yogoro, your son.
Steward, why was Lady Ichi dismissed?
She incurred our lord's displeasure.
But he's reluctant to give her to any man.
You're one of our lord's cavalry escorts, and given that your son is a fine man, he chose him.
I'll return for an answer in a few days.
But Sasahara, it is our lord's decision, so bear that in mind.
The steward is leaving!
Why should we accept Lady Ichi?
You should have refused at once.
What was it, of all that happened, that led our lord to dismiss her?
In the first place, she -
I know.
The daughter of the keeper of the records -
Everyone knows that.
The reason she was dismissed after bearing our lord's son, Kikuchiyo -
That's what I want to know.
- Mother, that's -
- You be quiet.
Three men gather in a room and still have no idea what's going on.
How embarrassing.
It's like this.
After Lady Ichi bore her son Kikuchiyo, she went to a spa to rest.
When she returned, she saw Lady Tama with our lord.
The daughter of Gohei Yamagiwa, the man in charge of the castle wardrobe, was serving beside him.
Lady Ichi lost her head on seeing this.
She sprang at Lady Tama, slapped her face, and dragged her by the hair.
Then she seized our lord by his garments and slapped him repeatedly.
A vain, wild woman who would attack our lord -
How can we accept her?
But, Mother...
I think we should gratefully accept her without being difficult.
Bunzo!
No matter what you say, we must accept her.
It's an order from our lord.
I'm afraid...
I don't feel very enthusiastic about it.
Neither do I.
But if I refuse, there may be trouble later.
Yogoro has said nothing, but he wouldn't be happy marrying a lord's mistress who has borne a child.
Marrying unwillingly and under pressure.
Different circumstances, but much like my own marriage into the Sasahara family.
I don't want him to repeat my mistake.
Sasahara!
Isaburo,
I didn't find you at your office.
They said you'd be at the border.
I'm glad I found you.
I heard everything.
The steward and chamberlain are good judges.
Alert even in times of peace.
It's an honor that a member of our group has been chosen.
But, Isaburo... as for the marriage and other matters,
I suggest you keep things quiet.
You'll probably receive a larger fief.
So be modest about it or the others will think you're showing off.
Understand?
Anyway, I congratulate you.
A happy event.
What nerve.
He's not thinking of you or your family.
Only outward appearance and influence matter with him.
Will you draw on your secret principles of swordplay?
Push and you step back.
Push further, and you step back further.
But at the last moment, you skillfully switch from defense to offense.
Yet you never attack.
You wait until your opponent tires.
In other words, until he gives up.
Unworthy?
Yes.
We cannot accept our lord's favored lady.
There's no need to be so reserved.
It's happened before, not just in the Aizu clan, but in every clan.
I'm well aware of that, but even so, I wish to decline the honor.
Decline?
Sasahara, that will not be allowed.
It is our lord's personal wish.
You'd -
I mean no disrespect.
We are not worthy of such an honor.
You know our lord's wish.
It's an order!
I would never disobey him, but if I may decline...
What?
To decline is to defy the order!
No, I'd never do that.
It's just that we're unworthy of the honor.
Sasahara.
You refuse to agree to it?
It's not about agreeing or disagreeing.
We are unworthy of the honor.
What? You continue saying that?
Father,
I wish to accept the honor.
What?
Young men seem to be more understanding.
I don't know what use it is to think only of martial arts.
Isaburo Sasahara, you seem a bit too stubborn.
May you enjoy long life together
We'll all be at your side as long as you live
This is a day of celebration
Let our spirits celebrate this happiness
I am not very competent, but I hope you will be good to me.
You may have been our lord's lady once, but you have now married into the Sasahara family.
Keep that in mind.
Suga, you needn't -
No. I must say it in order to keep discipline in our home.
A woman who was dismissed after bearing a child.
Pampering her would spoil her.
Welcome back.
I'm sorry I didn't notice your return.
It's all right.
Where's Nui?
Mother took her along for prayer at Shonenji Temple.
Where's Father?
He came home about an hour ago, when his duties were done.
Ichi.
Mother may say things to offend you, but don't mind her.
No, she doesn't offend me.
She kindly teaches me domestic duties.
I don't believe it.
If things grow disagreeable and hard to bear, think of Father.
Father?
Father finds the way Mother thinks and talks disagreeable.
But despite that, he has borne everything for 20 years.
Ichi, is dinner ready?
Yes, right away.
A bottle of sake tonight as well.
While the cat's away.
You mustn't.
If she'd just change a little, all would be well.
The world never seems to go right.
"I wish to retire and have Yogoro, my eldest son, succeed me.
I humbly hope that my request will be granted."
Sasahara, how are your son and his bride doing?
Very well, I'm happy to say.
You made such a fuss about this in the beginning, but now it's all going very well?
I'm very sorry.
It's too early to retire, I think, but his son has married, so -
All right.
We'll ask the steward to enquire of our lord.
It won't take long to obtain his approval.
So Isaburo Sasahara's retiring at last?
I didn't realize it at the time, but it's a great relief.
At the same time, it's a Ionely feeling.
I wonder what I've done all my life, though it's not like me to do so.
Yogoro's marriage is a very happy one.
Perhaps life will be a little better for our children.
At least Yogoro's better off than me.
Fear often exceeds the perceived danger.
So it was in your case.
Yogoro's wife.
She's a fine wife.
I thought she'd be like a cannon, ready to go off at any time.
But I was very wrong.
Suga's just the same as before, but Ichi is always pleasant and never talks back.
I don't understand.
Why did she attack our lord then?
Like yourself,
I don't understand it either.
As I've said, your duties won't be difficult.
Check the weapons in the armory against the inventory list, and have the men clean them on appointed days.
That's about all.
It's harder to get along with our superiors and fellow vassals.
I don't say to always yield to them, but at times, they're unreasonable.
If you get angry at them every time, you won't last.
Pardon me.
Rice cakes?
They look good.
Yes. Enjoy.
Wait, Ichi.
I'm going to retire soon.
Yogoro will become the head of our family, and you're his wife.
You needn't hold back for the old woman.
Take over the household duties.
Understand?
Even so, she is my mother, and I will treat her as such.
Excuse me.
That's enough about your duties, Yogoro.
How about some rice cakes?
But I don't understand.
Well... it's almost beyond belief that she'd grasp her lord by his clothing.
It was hard for me to believe too, so I asked her the other day.
Her face became very sad as she told me the story.
I was 19 when I went to serve my lord.
It was the year before last.
Ichi.
Actually, there is a reason the steward has come to see me.
You have found favor in our lord's eyes and are to serve him.
Accept the honor gratefully.
The sudden news must have surprised you.
I was more angry than surprised.
Angry?
A man over 50 was infatuated with me.
I felt as if a hairy worm were crawling over me.
I shuddered.
And then?
Our lord does not do this just to satisfy a whim.
Daimyo must have heirs or their houses will be abolished.
The only heir to our lord right now is young Lord Masamoto.
Should anything happen...
Even so, Miss Ichi, not just anyone can become our lord's mistress, for her son may one day become our lord's heir.
She must be beautiful and kind like you.
I am afraid
I must decline the position.
You are referring to Sannojo Kasai, your fiancé?
Kasai?
Yes.
Our parents arranged our engagement.
Then if Sannojo agrees, you will gratefully agree to serve our lord?
What do you say?
I couldn't imagine Sannojo doing it.
But he bowed to our lord's wishes and gave you up?
Yes.
So you had no choice?
I still did not wish to go.
So I withheld my answer.
Don't bother me!
Leave now!
No.
I will not leave until I see Sannojo.
You said you would serve our lord if Sannojo agreed.
He has clearly agreed to it.
As summoned,
Hyoemon Shiomi's daughter Ichi is here in answer to your wishes.
It was like dragging a pure silk kimono through the mud.
Then I thought -
No, it was more like a prayer.
I made up my mind.
I would bear him sons.
Many, many sons.
Then other girls need never know my misery. It would end with me.
It was like a prayer.
My thoughts were really like a prayer.
With this prayer,
I bore Kikuchiyo a year later.
Then I went to a spa for postnatal rest at my lord's orders.
When I returned to the castle -
Ichi, this is Lady Tama.
Be friends with her.
It wasn't jealousy!
On the face of his new young mistress, there was not even a trace of humility.
I hated her for it.
She was proud as a peacock - glad to be a mistress.
Beast!
Beast!
Thanks to his displeasure toward you,
I have become a happy man.
I could never have found a better wife.
Beginning tonight,
I will forget my son.
What?
Our lord means nothing to me.
But...
I have been so worried about the son I bore.
So worried.
Beginning now...
I will forget about him too.
I will forget him.
Yogoro, be good to Ichi.
You're a lucky man.
There's no other wife like her.
A couple without children lacks binding ties.
You've made me wait nearly two years, but at last.
A boy would have been better.
We mustn't ask for too much.
And what's her name?
Yogoro and I racked our poor brains over this and named her Tomi.
Post-horse messenger!
Ryuzo Komiya here from Edo on an urgent mission!
What?
Young Lord Masamoto died of illness?
Yes!
He was resting from a cold he caught on the 12th.
But his condition grew worse.
At 2:00 in the morning, he passed away.
It's a lucky thing.
What?
It's the death of the heir.
But the Matsudaira house will not be abolished.
There is young Lord Kikuchiyo, the son of Shiomi's daughter.
But Sasahara,
Lord Kikuchiyo has become our lord's heir.
So Ichi is birth mother to the heir.
If she remains the wife of a vassal, there would be much talk.
You say this is our lord's wish?
Yes.
And our chamberlain here and the Edo chamberlain agree.
Please consider it before formal orders come.
The best thing is for Yogoro to submit a request to our lord and say he will send Ichi back to the castle.
Has Yogoro been told already?
I've been at him since the day before yesterday, but he refuses.
Naturally.
They have a baby daughter, Tomi.
Well, I don't blame him.
Emotionally it is intolerable.
The chamberlain and steward know that.
But you know very well... that we can't have all our wishes granted in this world.
So... you're telling me to make Yogoro agree to it?
I'm asking you to submit a voluntary request rather than making us order her back.
You must see the difference.
What's the matter, Ichi?
You're pale. Are you sick?
Group Head Kotani came over in the afternoon.
I feel... more resentful than grateful... for your consideration.
I'm sorry, Ichi.
I didn't mean to hide it.
But I couldn't bring myself to tell you.
Brother.
Father is calling you.
What are the men talking about?
I'm not sure.
Acting as if some crisis has occurred and hiding it from me.
Tell them to talk at night after they dine!
Ichi, I must tell you something.
Come into the room.
First, Father's words.
He says he's retired, so I am the family head, and I am to do what I think is right.
However, he also says you're too important to us to send away.
That we must take the best possible care of you.
Mother doesn't seem to know anything about this yet.
I must tell her sooner or later.
Don't worry.
No matter what anyone says,
I will not send you back to the castle.
For Tomi's sake too.
It may be our lord's wish, but he is being too selfish.
Ichi is not a doll.
She is a living being.
Yes, you're right.
You're young.
And I don't blame you.
But you can't reason with a crying child nor with your lord, as they say.
Isaburo, what's your opinion?
I have none.
Yogoro is head of the Sasahara family now.
It's all up to him.
But I would like to say one thing.
What is it?
When we accepted Lady Ichi into our house, it was Steward Takahashi that came.
I'd like him to come again now and explain in his words why we must return her.
If only he could!
But it would attract too much attention.
These are our lord's orders, Isaburo!
Well, I want my lord to explain his orders to me.
When his son's mother proves inconvenient, he forces her to marry a vassal.
Inconvenienced once again, he demands her return.
This is cruel and unreasonable.
He has no understanding of human emotions.
No understanding of human emotions?
Kotani-san, our family didn't accept Ichi particularly gratefully.
Nor did Ichi herself know Yogoro or the Sasahara family.
She was none too happy about it either.
But the reason they are getting along is because they're kind to each other and care for each other.
I understand all that clearly enough.
But Isaburo, if you continue to be so stubborn, who knows what might happen to your family.
I don't care.
I will not return Ichi, even if the heavens rain fire!
What?
Even if the heavens rain fire... and blood?
Wait, Yogoro.
Watch your language!
Kotani-san,
I think this is enough for today.
I beg you.
You should understand, Mother, being a woman yourself.
If you were in her place, what would you do?
Would you give up Tomi and return to the castle?
Enough!
Would you ruin our family because you've lost your head over a woman?
In this case -
In this case, it may be unavoidable.
Brother!
You truly don't care if you ruin our family?
- I am.
- What?
Bunzo, if you were me, would you return Ichi?
Of course I would!
You're too attached to her, brother!
Restrain yourself, Bunzo.
Yogoro's the head of the family.
Right or wrong, it's all up to him.
Be patient.
Don't lose hope.
If you love Yogoro and Tomi, be prepared to defy such senseless conventions, however hard it may be.
I believe that, if worst comes to worst, you are a wife worth protecting, even if that means ruining our family.
I am not worthy of it.
But this won't be the end of it.
I gave her the message.
She will be here soon.
Over here, sister.
We've heard all about what has happened.
We relatives and the Sasahara family have discussed what to do.
We've spoken to Yogoro and know exactly how he feels.
Thus we have come to the conclusion that the rest is up to you.
We'd like to know how you feel about it.
Do you want to stay with Yogoro, even if it means ruining the Sasahara family?
Answer us, Ichi!
I would like to stay.
Even if you ruin the family?
Yes.
Ichi.
Your father, Hyoemon Shiomi, has asked our lord that you be sent back to the castle as soon as possible.
I'm sure you're aware of that.
Not only that.
He lies in wait when Yogoro travels to and from the castle to plead with him to send you back.
He's done this several times.
Father is Father. I am me.
I would rather die than return.
Please tell the chamberlains and steward how I feel in whatever words you think will best help my case.
If we could do that, we wouldn't be here like this!
We ask you again, Ichi!
Your desire to stay with Yogoro is final?
The family doesn't matter?
Not only the Sasahara family, but we the relatives will be jeopardized as well.
You still don't care?
It cannot be helped.
I see.
There's no use trying to convince a woman like this.
You should give up, Suga.
Yogoro's to blame too.
It's your misfortune that a woman like her has favored you.
Yogoro, you needn't hold back anymore.
You two go ahead and ruin your family!
We must prepare for our involvement as well!
Completely impervious to reason.
No wonder you attacked our lord!
Ichi, I'm sorry.
Return.
Return to the castle.
Fool!
Why do you say that now?
What's the Sasahara family to you?
What are your relatives' troubles to you?
Yogoro, have you decided you want to keep your position?
Listen to me.
My father-in-law was impressed with my swordsmanship.
As head of the Sasahara, he asked me to marry into the family.
But otherwise I have no talents.
In other words, I'm a worthless, good-for-nothing man.
So in order to prove myself, for these past 20 years
I have fought to preserve our good name and social standing.
So why am I so obstinate now?
The cruel injustice involved, for one thing.
But your beautiful love for each other has touched me most of all.
There's never been a shred of love in my married life!
And now you do this!
Promise me, Yogoro, that you'll never let Ichi go!
You too.
No matter what happens, never leave him!
Promise me, both of you!
My husband's with the chamberlain?
Yes, and he's waiting for you to come.
I saw him in the castle.
He said he'd be at the chamberlain's residence and that you must come at once.
The chamberlain wishes to see you both.
He has some questions for you.
But what about Tomi?
You needn't worry.
It won't take long.
I will accompany you.
My brother's waiting.
Make yourself clear, as you did with our relatives.
Sister!
If you lose heart now, what will it mean for my brother?
Even if it is the chamberlain, show him how determined you both are to keep your resolve.
Hurry!
Sister.
Father, where did you go today?
To see Tatewaki.
Anything new at the castle?
No, nothing yet.
At this rate, perhaps -
I hope nothing happens.
Why is Tomi crying like that?
Where's Ichi?
- She went out.
- Out?
To the chamberlain's residence, at about 2:00.
What?
The chamberlain's residence?
Mother.
Where's Ichi?
What happened to Ichi?
Where's Bunzo?
Bunzo, where's Ichi?
What's happened to Ichi?
Mother wouldn't say anything.
But Sahei and Nui say you took her to the chamberlain's residence.
I'm asking you about Ichi!
As a matter of fact -
Bunzo, you tricked her.
How many times must we tell you, Ichi?
We had no choice.
No matter how many times I'm told,
I do not understand.
What?
My husband, child and father must be worried about me.
I'm going home.
Wait, Ichi!
If she doesn't agree to our requests and still insists on going home, then she may do so.
Provided that she's willing to have Yogoro Sasahara and his father, Isaburo, commit seppuku.
Ichi, take my advice and return to the castle.
If you go back to the castle obediently without making a fuss, the chamberlain is willing to overlook everything.
But if you insist on returning home, not only will Yogoro, but also his father, Isaburo, be ordered to commit seppuku for lax supervision of their home.
Honorable Lady Ichi, please return to the castle.
You say you're the wife of footman Bansaku Kariya?
Yes.
My name is Kiku.
The chamberlain's orders?
What orders?
He said to come here every morning and evening to breast-feed your daughter Tomi.
I want no charity.
Go home!
But... if I go home without -
Say no more! Go home!
- But -
- Do as I say!
Wait!
Fool.
Tomi, you fool.
How can you be so happy at a strange woman's breast?
Tomi, you fool.
Yogoro.
Starting tomorrow, do not report to the castle for duty!
I've already prepared myself for that.
How's Yogoro?
He hasn't reported for duty since these events.
But he did request time off due to illness.
And Tomi?
The chamberlain ordered the wife of footman Bansaku Kariya to come and feed her twice a day.
She's healthy and reliable.
A good, solid woman.
Then everything's all over?
Yes.
Certainly since Ichi has returned to the castle.
In the end, we had no choice but to have it this way.
We just took a roundabout path.
Defying the clan gets us nowhere.
Isaburo, do you really mean that?
I came to make sure of your thoughts on this matter.
And now,
I hope you'll forget everything.
Give it up at once.
To be honest, the clan's treatment of your family and your attitude in response have weighed on my mind.
Weighed on your mind?
It's like your swordplay.
Pushed, you step back.
Pushed again, you retreat further.
But it's not like you to give up.
The clan didn't ask for her formally.
It was more like force.
In fact, it was more like kidnapping.
They took a vassal's wife.
If the shogunate officials in Edo hear of it, or even the daimyo, it may prove a fatal mistake for the Matsudaira.
I can't imagine things will end like this.
That you'll allow them to end here.
I really don't think so.
You're saying I must formally ask the castle to take her back?
That is all we can do.
It's for the sake of the Sasahara family.
They've committed an outrage!
Yet I must ask them to take her back?
We're asking you.
And I do understand how you feel.
I was quite afraid you'd storm the chamberlain's residence.
It was wise of you to hold back.
The chamberlain and steward are impressed by your restraint.
So if you send them your request -
I refuse!
I don't remember sending her back to the castle.
Yogoro.
It's all over now.
Why don't you do as he says?
That's ridiculous, Father!
Never!
Think of Ichi.
She suppressed her tears, left everything behind, and quietly returned to the castle.
If I were to think of Ichi, how could I possibly give up on her?
Yogoro, that's like calling a doctor for the dead.
What did you say?
Now, now, Yogoro.
Yogoro's young yet.
Isaburo, talk to him until he understands.
It's all for the sake of your family.
It's not only for my family, but for yours too, and the rest of our kin.
In any case, please go for now.
Yogoro will be hard to convince, but I'll talk to him.
Give me a few days.
Yogoro will report today and say he wishes to return her?
Yes.
That's wonderful.
Thank you for your trouble.
All has turned out well in the end.
Now we can look forward to the Suwa Shrine festival tomorrow.
Tomorrow is the Inoko festival?
Since it would have come to this anyway, how dare they cause all that fuss!
Yogoro was wrong, but Isaburo was insolent as well.
Yes.
He's always henpecked by his wife.
And defying clan orders like that -
I must say he seems like a different man.
It's settled now, so we needn't criticize him.
His conduct has been admirable.
It calls for a slight increase in his fief.
Yogoro Sasahara of the escort group has arrived!
I'm glad you've reported for duty.
We heard you were sick.
Are you well now?
Yes, completely well.
And so?
Taking into consideration my father's wishes, I have decided.
Please accept this.
That's good of you.
Thank you.
Fool!
What's gotten into you?
"Petition.
Ichi, the wife of my eldest son Yogoro, was unlawfully kidnapped and forced to return to the castle.
This is the cruelest form of tyranny.
It runs counter to the laws of humanity and cannot be condoned by the heavens.
We hereby appeal for her immediate return.
If our petition is refused, this shameless act of tyranny on the part of Masakata Matsudaira, lord of the Aizu domain, and his retainers shall be made known throughout Japan's 60 provinces.
November 18th, 1727, 2:00.
Isaburo Sasahara, Aizu clansman."
A word of caution.
Someone may use my father's name or my own to submit a request to return Ichi to the castle.
But it will not be from us.
It will be a false request.
Please keep that in mind.
Excuse me.
Thank you for coming every day.
With the Inoko festival starting tomorrow, you must be busy.
Master.
We're just airing the house out a bit.
But -
The mats?
It's a custom at times like these.
So our feet won't slip in the blood.
Tomi's been waiting for you.
Let her drink her fill.
This may be the last time.
Will you do me a favor?
Will you cook the rice after you feed Tomi?
I dismissed all our servants.
I also sent Suga and Bunzo away so we'd have a little more room.
Just cook the rice.
We'll make the rice balls ourselves.
Can't fight on an empty stomach.
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Orders from our lord!
Accept obediently!
I said orders from our lord!
Will you not obey?
It's too late for orders now!
Now, now, Yogoro.
Let's hear what the orders are.
Orders!
Isaburo and Yogoro Sasahara, for your insolent conduct and defiance toward our lord, you are ordered to commit seppuku.
Seppuku?
It is gracious of our lord to permit it.
I thought men would come arrest us and then either hang or crucify us.
We will bravely commit seppuku.
Father.
However, we want something before we kill ourselves.
Bring us three heads!
What?
Those of Lord Masakata Matsudaira, ruler of the Aizu domain,
Chamberlain Yanase, and Steward Takahashi.
Bring me the heads of the villains who took my son's wife!
You!
Vassal Tatewaki Asano in charge of boundary gates has arrived!
Tatewaki, I called you for nothing other than this.
Prepare at once to kill
Isaburo and Yogoro Sasahara.
I hear you are
Isaburo's only equal as a swordsman.
If you think he's too much for you, take four or five strong men with you.
This is a strange request.
What?
The Sasaharas have defied clan orders.
Are they not now criminals in the eyes of our clan?
Yes.
Then it's the superintendent's duty to arrest them.
I'm in charge of border gates.
In other words, my duty is to keep track of those leaving or entering our land.
Since when have I become a superintendent?
This is no time to discuss jurisdiction.
You're wrong.
The trouble began in an attempt to adhere to daimyo rules stating that the mother of our lord's heir must not remain a vassal's wife.
We must follow the rules.
If you order me to kill them, please promote me to superintendent here and now and obtain our lord's promise to increase my fief to 500 koku, according to clan rules.
Tatewaki.
You've gone too far.
Why be so formal now?
Never mind. Go!
We must gather men, use force and kill them.
Get ready.
A foolish idea.
What?
Isaburo's a swordsman without peer.
You'll only make more trouble by sending men.
In order to settle matters quietly, send Lady Ichi back to the Sasahara family for now, and then later -
What?
Don't talk nonsense!
But Chamberlain, resort to violence and you'll have mountains of dead and wounded men.
Cold, isn't it?
What time is it?
Past 9:00, I think.
Eat in moderation.
That should be enough for you.
Someone's coming.
From the footsteps, he's alone.
It's Bunzo.
Don't just stand there.
Come around here!
Father!
Don't talk.
I know what you want to say.
Now, come in.
Father!
Come in, Bunzo.
Father!
Is it nice and cozy at Kenmotsu's place?
Have a drink.
Listen to the festival drums.
Father!
I know what you want to say.
You were pressed by our relatives at Kenmotsu's place to come here as their messenger and say,
"We've defied our lord long enough.
Now obey clan orders with good grace."
Father.
Have a drink.
Bunzo, don't hate us.
Not only you and Mother will be punished, but our kin too, for being related to such reckless men.
Father.
But remember:
Each must live his own life.
As for what happened,
I don't blame you and Suga for what you did, nor do I bear you any grudge.
Each must live his own life.
Have a drink and then go back.
And tell everyone this for me:
I, Isaburo Sasahara, in all my life have never felt more alive than I do now.
Prepare for our lord's entrance!
Haven't you taken care of Sasahara yet?
What are you doing?
A mere clansman has defied me and the entire clan.
What if other clans hear of this,
Sanzaemon?
Gather some men and take care of it yourself.
Before dawn.
- Yes, but -
- What?
The chamberlain's intervention would aggravate matters.
Please allow me.
You'll go, Geki?
Father, the drum from the Suwa Shrine has stopped.
It's late. They're probably done for the night.
Two years ago today, we were asked to accept Ichi.
I remember it too.
Outside the castle, it was the Inoko festival, when the harvest god left.
Inside the castle, it was the day before the Suwa Shrine festival.
Father.
I may seem unmanly -
What is it?
For some reason,
I am more worried... about Ichi's future than Tomi's.
That's as it should be.
It's not unmanly at all.
Your feelings for each other gave me new life.
But Yogoro, don't be too worried about Ichi.
We will die here, but she is the mother of our lord's heir.
No one can torture her, and no one will endanger her life.
But Father, aren't they late in coming?
I meant to ask for permission to enter, but the gate was open, so I came in.
Forgive me.
I will now convey our lord's orders.
We have heard of the order to commit seppuku.
No.
He changed his orders.
Isaburo and Yogoro Sasahara, for your insolence and attitude toward our lord, you will be confined at Enshoji Temple outside the castle.
A very light punishment compared to seppuku.
Why the sudden change?
Lady Ichi, the mother of our lord's heir, was once a family member here.
She pleaded with our lord to save your lives.
Will you gratefully accept our lord's new orders?
No.
No, he's wrong!
As Yogoro Sasahara's wife,
I appealed through the chief maid,
Yoshino, to my lord to save my father and husband.
It was not as the heir's mother.
I am...
I am still the wife of Yogoro Sasahara.
To tell you the truth, what Lady Ichi says is correct.
But our lord received me in his audience.
If she appeals to save you as the heir's mother, not as Yogoro's wife, he promised to change his orders from seppuku to confinement.
I don't understand what this is all about.
Neither do I.
Steward, it seems we don't understand what you just told us.
It's very simple.
If you two admit that
Ichi is no longer a family member and that she has been returned, our lord will listen to her plea for a lighter punishment.
Will you acknowledge her return and live, or refuse and fight it out?
Which will it be?
In that case, we ask for no mercy.
We are prepared for the worst.
Then there is no alternative?
None.
It's all of you who cannot be pardoned, who are holding
Yogoro's wife as prisoner and still insist on doing so.
Please return her at once!
All right.
You've made yourselves very clear.
I'll ask Lady Ichi now.
Lady Ichi, will you save the lives of these men?
Or will you let their pursuers come and kill them?
Lady Ichi, the Sasaharas are men.
Their pride will not let them back down.
But your position is different.
You have already returned to serve our lord.
If you tell them that you sever your ties with them once and for all, then all will be well!
Is that clear?
If you do, their lives will be saved.
We need not ask them to return you.
And even though they petition for your return, it can be disregarded as long as you sever your ties with them.
Wait!
Don't move!
Don't move.
If you do, unexpected accidents may occur.
Lady Ichi, will you sever your ties with them and save their lives?
Or will you let them die as traitors?
What will your answer be?
Lady Ichi, does your silence mean you will do as I say?
Am I correct?
No.
I -
What will you do then?
Kill them!
Father.
Yogoro!
Father...
Tomi, bid your father and mother farewell.
Have a good look at them.
They are your father and mother.
Let us who are still alive listen to them.
Let's listen to what they want us to do.
No, I know without being told.
I know how they felt about their plight and their death.
They want us to tell the world of our clan's cruelty!
Very well. I understand.
We promise to do that for you.
We'll topple the Aizu clan from its pedestal!
First, Tomi and I will go to Edo together and see the shogunate elders.
We'll leave immediately for Edo.
Isaburo Sasahara of the escort group... where are you going?
Tomi and I are going to Edo.
If this is for the clan, show me your pass.
If it's private business, show me the clan ticket.
I have neither.
Then I'm afraid
I cannot let you pass.
We must go to Edo though we have no permit.
You mean to pass from this domain without having either?
Yes.
To carry out my duty and uphold my honor as a samurai,
I must forbid it.
If you insist on breaking our law and passing through this gate,
I must stop you at the risk of my life.
That can't be helped.
She is very quiet.
I'd like to put her in the house away from the wind.
But men we dislike are in there.
Venomous men.
I fed her before dawn.
I don't think she's hungry.
But I'll give the poor thing a little more.
Before feeding babies rice, we're supposed to wait
100 days after birth... when enough teeth have come in.
But I'll do it now.
Tomi, here.
All the family members are supposed to celebrate this day together with red bean rice and live fish.
That's impossible now.
We'll make do with this.
You be quiet now, Tomi.
Don't cry even if I don't return.
In that case, he will become your foster father and raise you.
Well, then.
Lose this duel. Let me remain.
It's better that way.
What?
Isaburo, lose to me.
For Tomi's sake.
No.
No matter how strong you are, how perfect your defense,
I'll defeat you and go to Edo with Tomi.
Then...
I will win.
Without fail.
I will win without fail.
Tatewaki!
Three people helped you.
Yogoro, Ichi and Tomi.
I had no chance of winning.
Hurry.
Take Tomi with you to Edo.
Tatewaki!
We can't go to Edo anymore!
We can't go to Edo anymore.
No one will ever know the story of your father and mother now.
Tomi, it can't be helped.
But let me say one word.
Just one word.
When you grow up, become a woman just like your mother.
And marry a man just like your father.
Be sure to do that.
Marry a man just like your father.
THE END
 In the beginning was the Word,
and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.
 I am He.
He was in the beginning with God,.
All things were made through him,
and without him was made nothing
that has been made.
In him was life,
and the life was the light of men.
And the light shines on in the darkness,
and the darkness grasped it not.
The greatest story ever told.
You have been asking questions about a child.
We have, Your Majesty. We've come a great distance in search of him.
And who told you about such a child who is to be born a king in my kingdom?
We saw the rising of his star, and his star has been our guide.
You have followed a star from Asia to the centre of the world?
Aben?
Do you know of this child king they look for?
In prophecy there is mention made of a Messiah.
And where is this Messiah to be born?
The prophet Hosea named
Egypt as the place of birth.
The great Isaiah spoke of Nazareth.
That was 700 years ago.
Your Majesty, if I may be so bold, the prophet Michaeus named Bethlehem.
I remember.
"From you, Bethlehem, shall he come forth who is to be ruler in all Israel."
I am an Idumean, not a Judean.
The priests here in Judea mock me in their temple.
The temple which I built.
They accuse me of impiety.
Tell them, Antipas.
The priests are envious of my father.
He knows the prophets better, and has more faith in them.
Everyone knows that I am a pious man.
Magi, when you find this child, how can you be certain that he is the one?
By the accuracy of the stars.
Yes.
Then it is only by the star that you can know.
What greater spokesman can a child have than a star?
The air is cold. Your Majesty should rest.
If great Herod will give us leave, we should be on our way.
Go then.
If you find this child, bring me word, that I, too, might worship him.
Follow them and keep me informed.
 He shall be great...
and called the Son of the Most High.
And the Lord God will give him
the throne of his ancestor, David.
And his kingdom shall know no end.
Who are you?
We have come from a far land to see your child.
What will you name him?
Jesus.
Jesus will be his name.
I bring gold, for the sovereignty of our king.
And frankincense, for the worship of God.
And myrrh, for preservation until time everlasting.
The old king.
We leave at once.
 Take the child. Flee.
The stars foretold that one day I would be king.
- And I am king.
- Truly.
If there is anything in prophecy, surely it is not the stars, but God who has sent...
Huh! God! Where is God?
Or the child of God, except in man's most dangerous imagination?
The child of imagination is the child I fear.
And, my son, when you reign - if you do - remember that.
- Well?
- Sire.
We followed them.
They went to Bethlehem.
Bethlehem.
In fulfilment of your prophecy.
Prophecies have been scattered through history like seed. You can disregard this.
Or find one more fitting.
As I remember
"A voice was heard in Bethlehem, weeping and mourning."
"A voice was heard in Ramah."
Bethlehem...
"There was weeping and great mourning."
"It was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were no more."
Let this be the prophecy fulfilled.
Go to Bethlehem and kill this child.
To be sure, every newborn boy in Bethlehem must die.
Be certain that none escape.
You have a question?
Then go!
Sire.
Not one is alive.
"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace."
King Herod is dead!
King Herod is dead at last!
These travellers have just brought the news from Jerusalem.
Herod is dead!
Home.
Nazareth.
The old Herod is dead.
Death to the new one. Long live Israel!
How far is the nearest Roman legion?
Three days' march, sire. In Syria.
Send a messenger there, to the Roman governor.
Inform him... inform him that the eagle of Rome has been torn down and desecrated by a Jerusalem mob.
Send us the Deliverer, the Messiah.
Send us the Promised One.
Let these men be an example to all who challenge the peace of Rome.
I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised, and so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills...
Greetings, in the name of Augustus Caesar.
Caesar will not regret what he has done for the son of his old friend, King Herod.
What is that?
In time of trouble, the people pray for one to save them, a deliverer.
Your father kept the people in order.
In this you have failed.
I must inform you that we will take over.
My father's kingdom was guaranteed by Caesar.
From now on, a Roman legion, directed by a Roman governor, will govern Judea.
- You are the High Priest?
- As you see.
Shemiah, in the vestments of the High Priest.
From now on, those vestments will stay in my headquarters, and those who defy us will not be allowed to wear them.
Hear my cry, O God, attend unto my prayer; from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee.
Lead me to the rock that is higher than l; for thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait,
and in his word do I hope.
My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?
Why are thou so far from helping me?
O my God, I cry in the daytime,
but thou hearest not,.
And in the night season,
and am not silent.
Our fathers trusted in thee,.
They trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
They cried unto thee, and were delivered,.
They trusted in thee,
and were not confounded.
In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust,.
Deliver me in they righteousness.
Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against the ungodly nation;
O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust men.
For thou art the God of my strength.
Tomorrow a Roman escort will see you across the Jordan to your father's palace.
Jordan and Galilee will be your tetrarchy.
O send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me.
Send to us the Messiah, the Promised One, the Son of David.
Who is the Messiah they cry for?
Someone who will never come.
All nations shall call him blessed.
His name shall endure for ever.
His name shall endure for ever.
 Send to us the Deliverer,
the Promised One, the Messiah.
You're wasting your time.
If he were coming, he'd be here by now.
 Repent!
I desire steadfast love,
and not sacrifice.
A knowledge of God,
and not burnt offerings.
Repent! Repent!
Come near,
and listen to the voice of one
crying in the wilderness.
Every valley shall be filled,
and every mountain and hill
shall be brought low,
and the rough way smooth.
And all flesh shall see
the salvation of God.
Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
and make straight in the desert
a highway for our God.
Behold,
I send my messenger
who shall prepare the way.
Let the earth hear,
and all that is in it
and all things that come from it.
Repent!
Come near and listen to the voice of one crying in the wilderness.
Repent!
The anger of the Lord is upon all nations.
Repent.
There is one coming who will baptise with fire and with the Holy Spirit.
One whose coming has been of old, from time everlasting, is soon to be among us.
Greater than all of us.
One whose sandals
I am not worthy to carry.
Who are you?
I do not know you, yet I know you.
Baptise me, John.
What is your name?
Jesus.
Where born?
Bethlehem.
Is it not you who should baptise me?
Why do you ask me this?
In the scriptures it is written
"From you, Bethlehem, shall he come forth who is to be ruler in all Israel, whose coming has been of old, from time everlasting."
You are he.
The one we have been waiting for.
The world is waiting.
It sleeps, waiting to waken.
I will come back.
Lift up your heads,
O you gates!
And the King of Glory shall come in.
Get thee up into the high mountains.
Lift up thy voice with strength.
Lift it up!
Let all the nations be gathered together.
Say unto them "Behold your God!"
The Lord God will come
with a strong hand.
His arm shall rule for him.
Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God.
Ask it either in the depth,
or in the height above!
A long, hard climb, wasn't it?
Come on in, if you like.
Some think the whole of life should be hard like that.
An easy life is a sinful life.
That's what they think.
Not so.
Life should be as easy as a man can make it.
And it can be easy, friend, if a man knows the way to power and glory in this world.
Here. You must be hungry after your long climb.
- Have some.
- I'm fasting.
A man has to keep his strength up. Go on.
Are you sure you won't have a little?
How would you like to be the ruler of all of this?
Hm?
All of the power and the glory of these kingdoms?
I can give them to you.
If you do me homage, it will all be yours.
"Thou shalt do homage to the Lord thy God, and serve him only."
It is written
"He shall put his angels in charge, to keep thee from harm."
"And they shall hold up their hands lest you dash your foot against a stone."
If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here.
"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
If you're the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
It is written that a man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
 It is but a little while
all the earth shall be
turned into a fruitful field.
The eyes of the blind
shall see out of darkness.
The meek also shall joy in the Lord,
and the poor among men rejoice.
For the needy
shall not always be forgotten.
Their expectations
shall not perish for ever.
Arise. Shine!
For thy light is come,
and the glory of the Lord
is risen upon thee!
 All the tribes of the earth
shall see the Son of Man
coming in the cloud of heaven...
with power and great glory.
Baptist!
You are ordered to stop, in the name of the Grand Sanhedrin.
This is no heresy.
I speak the Word of God.
- You should come here to repent.
- Careful, friend.
They are the ones that do
Caesar's bloody work for him.
- There has been enough of this.
- There's nothing here for you.
You insult the decent sinners who come here to repent.
This is treasonous, and it will be reported.
Report it well.
You sit in our holy temple now and condemn the Romans... but you serve them.
Hypocrites!
This is our shepherd. The one who...
Those that are mine will know me.
And if they follow me, I will know them.
I am going back to Galilee.
Shepherd?
My name is Judas Iscariot.
Jesus, from Nazareth.
Rabbi?
Rabbi, I'm from Galilee.
We're fishermen... from the lake.
I am Andrew.
My brother, Peter. And this is...
- John.
- We would like to go with you.
Come with me.
I will make you fishers of men.
Let us pass!
Do not labour for the food that perishes, but for that which endures - the food of eternal life.
For the bread of God is that which comes from heaven and gives life to the world.
And everyone who eats of this bread will live for ever.
Therefore, put away all anxious thoughts about food to keep you alive, clothes to cover your body.
Life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
Think of the ravens.
They neither sow nor reap.
They have no storehouse nor barn.
Yet God feeds them.
And how much more are you worth than birds?
Is there a man among you who by worry can add one minute to his span of life?
If you cannot do so small a thing, why do you worry about your other needs?
O you men of little faith.
Do not set your heart on what you eat or drink.
These are things that all the others in the world run after.
You have a Father who knows that you need them.
Set your mind upon his kingdom, and all of these things shall be yours, without the asking.
Tell us, when will the Kingdom of God come?
The Kingdom of God is here, within you.
A thief has stolen my coat.
Is that all, Peter?
Is that all?! It was the only coat I had.
But of what value is a thing which can be stolen by a thief?
Go and find that thief.
Give him your cloak also.
And give him anything else he wishes within your power to give him, for he is poor in spirit, and in need.
But if everyone did what you say, thieves would soon take over the world.
Thieves and murderers walk in darkness.
You must be their light, Peter, not their judge.
All I'm saying is, someone has taken my coat.
I think he was wrong to take it.
All I'm saying, Peter, is that as you have been judging, you will be judged.
And with your measure, it will be measured to you.
It was the best coat I ever owned.
Be not troubled about your coat.
See the lilies of the field, how they grow.
They neither toil nor spin, but even Solomon, in all his glory, was never arrayed like one of these.
But how am I to keep warm?
Our work will start in Galilee.
I saw him last night.
He was just behind us.
Why do you follow us?
I heard what he said last night.
I liked it.
If he's going to say anything else,
I want to hear it.
Come.
Walk with me.
Sir?
Is what you say just for us, or is it for everyone?
- What is your name, my friend?
- James. Little James.
They call me "Little" because I am the youngest.
- What is your name?
- Jesus.
Ah, that's a good name.
Thank you.
Lord Caiaphas, I have a report from the River Jordan.
Yesterday this John the Baptist spoke blasphemy.
He said "Let the powers tremble."
- Who is this person, the baptist?
- John. He preaches revolution.
- Against the Romans?
- All authority.
"One is coming who is greater than I."
What?
It is written "The Messiah will come to the city of God."
Hup!
Governor Pilate will see the High Priest.
- Concerning what?
- Governor Pilate will tell you.
I see.
What a mighty fortress.
She that was great among nations has lost her glory.
Now she stretches out her hand.
There is no one to comfort her.
There will come a time to enter.
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that murders the prophets and stones those who are sent to her, how I long to gather your children.
But you shall never see me until the time when you say
"Blessings on him who comes in the name of the Lord."
They are pilgrims.
They must be hungry.
Good friends.
You are welcome to my house.
Come in for rest and food.
Hup!
Hail, Pilate.
Rome won't tolerate it.
I will not tolerate it.
- Why do you?
- What, Governor Pilate?
This man on the Jordan, John the Baptist.
Why do the people listen, give him encouragement?
The man is in King Herod's territory.
- Have you spoken of him to Herod?
- No.
Why not?
- We intended asking your permission.
- You have it.
Wait. Another thing.
I care nothing either for your superstitions or your God.
I'm here to keep order in this desert land, and that I will do.
I want to hear nothing more about this troublemaker, or anyone like him.
And what commandment is first of all?
Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one lord.
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind and with all thy strength.
And the second:
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
There is no greater commandment than these.
Well said. You said the truth.
To love one's neighbour as oneself is more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
I wish others could understand the wisdom of what you say.
They will. Won't they, Master?
You're not far from the Kingdom of God, Lazarus.
Tell me, would it be possible for me to go with you?
You are wealthy.
Yes, I am.
Do you consider wealth a crime?
Not at all.
But it may become a burden.
For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his soul?
Are you saying that a man cannot have both money and a soul?
I am saying that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
My brother will go to heaven.
He is a good man.
Did I say he was not good?
I said he is wealthy.
Where a man's wealth is, there is his heart also.
A man cannot serve two masters.
You cannot serve both God and money.
But I give my money to God.
I give a third of all I earn.
I know a widow woman who gave two pennies.
What is two pennies?
It was all she had.
But I love God.
Would you give up all you own and follow me?
Who could do such a thing?
You and your friends are welcome to stay the night.
We have room enough and food enough.
Lazarus, I will not forget you.
Stay, please.
We are grateful.
- I am frightened for him.
- Why, Mary?
He is too good.
Sire, these emissaries have come from Jerusalem with disturbing reports of a fanatic preacher, a so-called baptist, who incites great crowds on the Jordan river.
- Why do you come to me?
- He stands day after day in the water, spreading sedition.
Did it occur to you that as ruler, I have more to do than chase an eccentric, screaming hell and damnation, out of the Jordan river?
I humbly suggest that
Your Majesty has not grasped the inflammatory possibilities of this man's preaching.
Impostor.
All prophets are impostors.
He is attracting great crowds from all over Judea and Galilee, promising a better world to come.
Good for him. We can use a better world.
Preferably one without Romans.
He speaks of the Christ that is to come.
What did you say?
The Christ, Your Majesty. A Messiah.
Bring that baptist to me.
I wish we could go in another way.
Isn't one gate the same as another?
No.
In all the world there is only one gate which has my brother in it.
- Is your brother a beggar?
- I wish he were something that good.
My brother is a tax collector.
God help me.
A wicked man who collects taxes for the Romans from his own people.
From his own people.
Look. There he is!
Not one of our family speaks to him.
Do you love him?
He's wicked, I tell you. He drinks and swears and gambles and collects taxes.
Do you love him, James?
Yes.
Look, just ignore him as we go by.
If we stop, he'll say something vulgar.
- What is his name?
- Matthew.
Brother James!
What are you doing in Capernaum?
Looking for a woman?
Have you anything to declare?
Only myself and my Father.
Where is your father?
In my heart.
Well, why are you hiding him from me?
I am not hiding him.
He who sees the Son, sees the Father.
Has he anything to declare?
Yes. His love for you.
Well, now, uh...
I can't very well tax that... can I?
Follow me, Matthew.
You want my money, or don't you?
Oh, you made a bad mistake.
The day of the Lord comes, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger, to make the earth a desolation.
The Lord will punish the world for its evil, and the wicked for their iniquities.
When we know a sinner, we must look upon him with horror and drive him from us.
No.
A righteous man turns away from evil, for the way of the weak may lead him astray.
No.
Who are you?
Jesus, of Nazareth.
What do you wish to say?
In the scriptures it is written
"I desire mercy, not sacrifice."
I would tell you, rebuke your brother who sins, but if he repents, forgive him.
What do you think you are telling these good people?
I tell them to do unto others as they would have others do unto them.
Our God is a God of salvation, not of revenge.
Only through faith is there salvation.
And only through love is there hope.
Knock, and it shall be opened to you.
Ask, and it shall be given to you.
Have faith, and you shall be made well.
Believe, and you shall live for ever.
Walk with the glory of God in your heart.
Why do you speak of walking... to us who are crippled?
In the eyes of God, no man is crippled, except in his soul.
That's simple for you to say.
I cannot walk.
Rise... and you shall walk.
Are you mocking me?
I tell you, I cannot walk.
You have not tried because your faith is weaker than your legs.
I worship God, and my faith is strong.
Rise... and walk!
Look, I'm walking.
Look at me. I'm walking.
You...
Jesus of Nazareth, you... you have made me walk.
No.
It is your faith that has made you well.
There are many who cannot walk.
There are many more who can... but will not.
Look, I walk!
I walk.
Baptist!
I have orders to bring you to King Herod.
I have orders to bring you to God, heathen.
Will you come with us peacefully?
I won't come with you at all.
Repent!
Repent!
Your Majesty. The man is an animal!
I've heard many things about you, Baptist.
And I've heard many things about you, Herod. All bad.
- Repent!
- Bring him out.
Do you know to whom you are talking?
- I am your king.
- I have no king... but the Lord God.
- Where does he reign?
- Over all that has been,
- and all that will be.
- How may I meet him?
By standing in the next line you come to, this side of hell.
Christ has come.
Christ has come.
Where do I find this Christ?
- If there is such a one?
- He'll find you.
- I asked a question. I want an answer.
- Your answer's in the fires of hell, Herod.
Hell? There is no hell.
You'll stand at the Judgment with the other sinners.
- You speak absurdities.
- I see your queen.
Your brother's wife.
- Adulteress!
- You will die for this.
- You'll burn in hell for that.
- Take him away.
- In your bed you may smell the smoke.
- No pardon for you.
And none for you either.
No pardon for you, Herod!
King Herod!
I pity you!
I have come from the River Jordan.
The baptist was taken prisoner by Herod.
Is that why you come to us in the night?
I have been baptised by John the Baptist.
I am Simon.
Among the sons of women, there has not been a greater than John.
There is much to be done.
You are welcome, Simon.
Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls.
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
I am Thaddeus. May we follow you?
- I am Thomas.
- Follow me.
 I am the bread of life.
He who comes to me shall not hunger.
And he who believes in me
shall never thirst.
What's happening?
It's the preacher from Nazareth.
Large crowds gather to listen, and all one hears is "Jesus of Nazareth".
- Did you see him cure that cripple?
- With my own eyes, Lord Caiaphas.
Tell me, how can we know if the man was really crippled?
I know this man, and this is the first time I have seen him walk.
Ridiculous! A tale for children.
Sorcery.
Sorak,
I want you to go to Galilee and investigate this matter.
Of course.
But I say only a child would believe such a story.
Sorak, I will accompany you to Capernaum.
I've always been fond of children's stories.
I will go with you, Nicodemus.
Children's stories always have a certain truth within them.
 I am the good shepherd,
and I know mine, and mine know me.
And they shall hear my voice,
and there shall be
one fold and one shepherd.
Who is he?
Jesus of Nazareth!
They are saying that this Nazarene made a crippled man walk, and there are rumours of even more astounding things.
I have a report, Your Majesty, that he is gathering an army.
- An army? Is this true?
- It could hardly be called that.
Only a handful travel with him, no more than ten or 12.
Ten or 12 may travel with him, but thousands come to hear him.
Bring that baptist out.
I want to talk to him.
Is this creature your prisoner, or are you his?
How do you find your lodgings, Baptist?
Lonely... if the Lord weren't with me.
You are not alone, then, in your cell?
No. God comforts me.
He sustains me.
You talk like a fool.
- And I pray for your soul.
- Forget my soul.
Not till you remember it.
Go to your knees, ask God to forgive your sins.
Send back your brother's wife.
Now.
Kill me, Herod. That you can do.
Kill me, so I can live.
Before you leave us, Baptist, it grieves me to ask what you mean by that.
My body's worth nothing, you can do what you like with it.
But my soul is eternal... and you can't touch it.
What do you know about a man named Jesus, from Nazareth?
- He's the one.
- The one what?
Jesus is gathering to himself the souls of men, as a shepherd gathers in his flock.
Even now, in your own kingdom, there is an army growing greater than anything you can imagine.
You hear, Your Majesty?
An army. It's true.
So I have my answer.
It is my kingdom that this Galilean rebel wants.
Take him back!
Let them put him to death... and it will ease your mind.
Can you promise me that?
 If anyone wants
to follow in my footsteps,
he must give up all right to himself.
Day after day he must
take up his cross and follow me.
I assure you,
whosoever shall not receive
the Kingdom of God as a little child,
he shall not enter therein.
Suffer the little children
to come unto me, and forbid them not.
The kingdom of heaven
belongs to such as these.
Master.
Come back to Capernaum.
- What is your name?
- James.
Have you come this far for me, James?
I have. And I plead with you.
We hunger for your words. Come back to Capernaum and make us full.
As you can see, this Nazarene has gained a certain popularity.
You mean that all those people are here because of him?
Every day new ones arrive.
Hallelujah!
Behold our Messiah!
Hail, Son of David.
Why do you treat this woman so?
What has she done to deserve this?
She was caught in the act of adultery.
Is this true?
You have judged her rightly.
She is guilty of adultery.
The Law calls for her to be stoned.
Yes.
Let him among you who is without sin cast the first stone.
Who are you?
Mary... of Magdala.
No man speaks against you now, Mary.
Neither do I.
Go your way, and sin no more.
But how can he forgive a woman of sins?
- Cure me, Master. Cure me!
- Touch me!
- Mercy.
- Let me touch him.
Mercy, Lord. Lord!
Make me well.
I'm cured.
I'm cured!
It is your faith that has cured you.
You.
- You.
- Master.
You are our Messiah!
Hail the king! Hail the king! Hail the king!
I'm sending word of this to Jerusalem at once.
Sire. A messenger from Capernaum.
He brings us news of the Nazarene.
Brings us news of whom?
- Jesus, Your Majesty.
- The Galilean.
Sire, in Capernaum they are calling this carpenter their king.
King?
No one has ever caused such excitement, Your Majesty.
I do not believe these things I hear.
People worship him.
They go to their knees before him.
Your Majesty, they call him
"king" in your kingdom.
I saw it with my own eyes.
A sick child touched him and was cured.
Leprosy, Your Majesty.
You saw this?
As he was leaving the town, great crowds followed him.
I've heard enough.
Leave me.
May I suggest haste?
You may suggest anything you please.
Now leave me.
They grew hungry.
He fed them all, thousands of people, from a few loaves and fishes.
Baptist?
Baptist?
Herod.
The one you call the Christ, others are calling "king".
They shall call the Son of Man many things, and worship his name.
I will take him for my prisoner, and his fate shall be as yours.
He will triumph over all the forces you can bring against him, you mighty one, because he's the one prophesied.
- He was born in Bethlehem.
- Then he cannot be the one.
My father knew the prophecy, too, and took measures that it never be fulfilled.
The child he tried to kill was taken from his cradle to Egypt.
He lives today.
You lie!
Then listen to him who walks your kingdom.
Listen well to what he says.
For your swords will be useless against him.
I will argue with you no more.
I came to say farewell.
Farewell?
That's a word for friends.
Why do you use it with me?
I have never liked you, Baptist, yet I cannot bring myself to hate you.
I had not intended this night to happen.
You're going to free me.
- I'm going to kill you.
- Then you free me.
I hope so.
Repent!
 Repent.
Now take as many men as you need and arrest the Nazarene.
 Blessed are they which are
persecuted for righteousness' sake,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.
You are the salt of the earth.
You are the light of the world.
And let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
In this manner, therefore, shall you pray:
- Our Father...
- Our Father...
- who art in heaven...
- who art in heaven...
- What else?
- Two messengers from Capernaum, both reporting the same thing.
It began with a riot in the streets, but has now become a rebellion.
The party responsible is one Jesus of Nazareth.
He already has a large following and they are hailing him as king.
One day we hear this man has cured a cripple.
Another day, changed water into wine.
Now we hear that he has fed 5,000 people, and nobody seems to know where the food came from.
The next thing we know they'll be calling him the Messiah.
- And that isn't all.
- What else?
He walked on water.
Get out!
Tell me, who do men say that I am?
Some say another John the Baptist.
Others say you are one of the prophets.
Who do you say that I am, Judas?
You are a great leader.
The greatest teacher of all.
And you, Thomas?
You are Jesus of Nazareth.
That's all I know.
You are the Messiah!
The Christ!
The Son of the Living God!
A blessing on you, Peter.
Because you did not learn this from mortal man, but from my Father who is in heaven.
You, Peter, are the rock on which
I will build my church.
I will give you the keys of the kingdom.
And whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.
And whatever you allow on earth shall be allowed in heaven.
Pharisees, Master.
Peace be with you.
You must leave Galilee and go your way.
Herod intends to kill you.
Go and tell that fox, all that was written by the prophets will come true.
Today and tomorrow
I shall be on my way.
And on the third day,
I shall reach my goal.
For it cannot be that a prophet perish anywhere but in Jerusalem.
He must heed our warning.
We are going to Nazareth, among his own people.
There he is. He's come home.
It's the carpenter.
It's him.
What did he come back here for?
To show us signs and miracles?
Show us a sign.
You're the son of Mary and Joseph.
That's right. We know you.
We heard about Capernaum.
You made a cripple walk.
- Do the same here.
- He spoke the truth. They listened to him.
I tell you this, no prophet is recognised in his own home.
Why do you keep us waiting?
If you are the Messiah, say so plainly.
I say unto you, the prophecy is now fulfilled.
The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to announce good news to the poor, to give recovery of sight to the blind, justice and delivery to the afflicted.
I have come to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour.
That's blasphemy!
Let's get Old Aram.
- Bring Old Aram.
- Let's get Old Aram.
Get Aram!
Make him see. Give him sight.
Aram, it is Jesus.
Jesus?
The son of Joseph, long gone from us, and Mary.
I remember you as a child.
How good of you, Jesus, to remember me.
On with it.
Let us see the sorcery.
Give him sight.
If you're not a faker, show us a miracle.
It is written...
"Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God."
You, a mere man, claim to be God?!
You have ears, yet you do not hear.
I say it is blasphemy.
I say stone him!
If I am not acting as my Father would, do not believe me.
But if I am, accept the evidence of my deeds, so that you may know that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
How can you say this to us?
We know you.
Stone him!
Stone him! Stone him!
Master?
My good friend.
I have come to warn you.
They are seeking you.
My brother is ill.
I don't know how he found the strength to make this journey.
Martha and I would have travelled here alone, but we could not stop him from coming himself.
I had to tell you.
You will be arrested and taken to the city.
The soldiers are even now on their way here.
You and your friends must leave at once.
We'll see that the Master goes to the Jordan river. There is safety there.
Andrew and Nathanael will help you return to your home.
I know... it is you, Jesus.
Oh, I remember you.
Now you have grown so tall.
At one time, when you were a little fellow, you... you were always asking questions. And...
Lord!
Lord!
Lord!
Lazarus is sick and dying.
They beg you to come at once.
This sickness has not come for the death of Lazarus, but for the glory of God.
Master... are men like circles in the water?
Do they just... float away and are lost?
It was right there where John the Baptist stood.
When the baptist prayed... I felt good.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done...
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
As it is in heaven.
- Give us this day our daily bread,
- Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
- And lead us not into temptation,
- And lead us not into temptation,
- but deliver us from evil.
- But deliver us from evil.
- For thine is the kingdom,
- For thine is the kingdom,
- and the power, and the glory,
- and the power, and the glory,
- for ever and ever.
- For ever and ever.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Peter?
- What is it?
- We came as fast as we could.
- We've lost Lazarus.
Master, Lazarus is dead in Bethany.
You have cured many people, yet you did not help your friend.
I am glad for your sake that I was not there, Nathanael.
So that you may believe.
Let us go to Bethany.
If Lazarus is dead, what need is there to go now?
Why? Why must you go?
My Father's work is there.
Have you come to bury the dead?
Or have you come to feed the mourners?
You made a leper well.
You made a cripple walk.
Was it too much to ask that you keep my brother from dying?
Why do you come now that he's dead, when you could have come while he lived?
When he needed you!
Why?
Your brother will rise again.
Rise? Yes, he will rise.
On Judgment Day at the resurrection of us all!
I am the resurrection... and the life.
He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
And whosoever liveth and believeth in me... shall never die.
Do you believe this, Martha?
Do you believe this, Mary?
If you had only been here,
I believe that Lazarus would not have died.
Who is like thee, O Father in heaven?
Majestic in holiness, terrible in glorious deeds, doing wonders?
There is none that can deliver out of thy hand.
You wound and you heal.
You kill and you make alive.
Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon this man that he may live.
Lazarus.
Lazarus.
Come forth!
- What happened?
- Did you see?
- See?
- Jesus of Nazareth.
I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes.
Lazarus was dead.
He's alive!
He's alive.
The Messiah has come!
~ The kingdom of our Lord
and of His Christ
~ And of His Christ
~ And he shall reign for ever and ever
~ For ever and ever
~ King of Kings
~ For ever and ever
~ Hallelujah, hallelujah!
~ And Lord of Lords
~ For ever and ever
~ Hallelujah, hallelujah!
~ King of Kings
~ For ever and ever
~ Hallelujah, hallelujah!
~ And Lord of Lords
~ For ever and ever
~ Hallelujah, hallelujah!
~ King of Kings
~ For ever and ever
~ Hallelujah, hallelujah!
The Messiah has come!
A man was dead and now he lives!
I was crippled, and now I walk!
I was blind, and now I see!
Who has done this?
The man called Jesus.
~ Hallelujah!
There is a rumour in the streets.
They say that a man in Bethany has been raised from the dead.
Raised from the dead? And who, might I ask, achieved this miracle?
The Galilean.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of gods, for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his mercy endureth for ever; to him who alone doeth great wonders, to him that by wisdom made the heavens, to him that stretched out the earth above the waters, for his mercy endureth for ever; to him who made great lights, the sun to rule by day, the moon and the stars to rule by night; for his mercy endureth for ever.
Where did you get that oil?
I'm asking you where you got this oil.
This is expensive ointment.
Are you going to let her waste it like this?
Leave her alone.
Do you know this could have been sold for 300 pence?
It's a waste when there are so many poor.
Do you care so much for the poor, Judas?
What are we, if not poor?
You speak of the poor.
The poor you have with you always.
Do not begrudge me this bit of oil, for me you have not always.
O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good.
She is preparing me for my burial.
...mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks unto the God of gods, for his mercy endureth for ever.
O give thanks to the Lord of lords, for his mercy endureth for ever; to him alone...
Hosanna!
Hosanna! Hosanna!
Hosanna! Hallelujah!
- He must be arrested.
- An arrest on a holiday, Lord Caiaphas?
Hear that?
They call him "king". "Messiah".
Go! Take as many guards as you will need.
I am honoured.
"My house shall be called a house of prayer," says the Lord.
But you have made it a den of thieves!
It is written in the scriptures
"I desire mercy, not sacrifice."
"Rather the knowledge of God, than burnt offerings."
"I do not delight in the blood of bulls, and lambs, and goats."
You cannot buy yourself in the house of the Lord!
You have made a robbers' cave of my Father's house! Robbers!
Get out!
You have defiled this holy ground!
Think not that I have come to destroy the Law or the prophets.
I have not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
These scribes and these Pharisees, all things which they tell you to do, do them!
But do not take their works as your example, for they do not practise what they preach.
Everything they do, they do to be seen doing it.
And for pretence they make long prayers.
They like to be called "father", "teacher".
I tell you now, there is only one teacher and one Father.
He is your Father which is in heaven.
Your Majesty, they are saying the Messiah has come. The Anointed One. Christ.
Governor Pilate wants to know what you are doing about this disturbance.
The man is being arrested.
The people...
They would not let us take him.
You, too, have your troubles with Jerusalem, Governor.
- They are a very difficult people.
- Nothing I can't handle, I assure you.
The situation is beyond their control.
The crowds grow more difficult.
- Move out and restore order.
- Yes, sir.
Clear the streets. Close the gates, and maintain the peace.
- Yes, sir.
- Double the guard around King Herod.
We'd regret it if something unpleasant happened to so... honoured a guest.
And bring the Nazarene to me!
You know, he is actually telling people to love their enemies.
Hosanna!
I have come to bring salvation to the world.
Hosanna!
I have come as a light into the world.
And no man who has faith in me will go on living in the dark.
And if any man gives ear to my words and does not keep them,
I shall not be his judge.
I have not come to bring judgment but salvation to the world.
While you have the light, walk in the light.
While you have the light, put your faith in the light, that you may become sons of the light.
Faith, hope and love abide, these three.
But the greatest of these is love.
And remember, where several gather together in my name, there will I be.
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
He leadeth me beside the still waters.
- He restoreth my soul.
- He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
- For thou art with me.
- For thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
He that hath clean hands and a pure heart...
He that hath clean hands and a pure heart...
...who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully...
We only pray.
Stand aside.
Stand aside.
...that seek thy face, O Jacob.
...that seek thy face, O Jacob.
- Lift up your heads, O ye gates!
- Lift up your heads, O ye gates!
And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors.
...lift up, ye everlasting doors.
And the King of glory shall come in.
Charge!
- Who is this King of glory?
- Who is this King of glory?
- The Lord, strong and mighty,
- The Lord, strong and mighty,
- the Lord, mighty in battle!
- The Lord, mighty in battle!
- Who is it?
- Me.
When I ask "Who's there?", why do you answer "Me"?
It was me, Peter.
The Romans are patrolling the streets.
- Where's the Master?
- He's coming with the others.
Master.
Who are you?
My name is Judas.
A friend of Jesus of Nazareth.
Lord Caiaphas, we have a guest.
His name is Judas.
He's a friend of the Nazarene.
How long have you been his friend?
I have been Jesus' friend for three years.
And now you are no longer his friend?
I am his friend still...
I believe.
Why have you come to us?
I will give him to you... if you promise that no harm will come to him.
If you are willing to betr... to give him to us, why do you care what happens to him?
Jesus... is the purest, kindest man I have ever known.
I have never seen him do anything but good.
His heart... his heart is so gentle.
Old people worship him.
Children adore him.
I love him.
Very well.
We will do our best to see that no harm comes to the man.
Where do we find him?
You cannot.
Just tell us, and we'll send the guards.
I will lead you to him tonight.
I must be there.
I am not so much a coward that I cannot face him... when I stab him.
We shall be waiting.
Father, the hour has come.
You, who have been with me so long, who have given up all to follow me, to walk with me down all those dusty roads.
Through all of it, you have been my friends.
And I have loved you.
But I tell you now, the hand that will betray me is on this table.
No.
- Not I, Master.
- Not I.
No, Master.
Master, who is it?
Who is going to betray you?
One who is eating bread with me tonight.
Is it I?
Only for a little while longer am I with you.
Where I am going you may not come.
Why can't I come with you now?
You will come later.
I will die for you.
Will you, Peter? Will you die for me?
I will.
I will.
Oh, Peter, Peter,
I tell you in truth, before the cock crows, you will have denied me three times.
Even if I die for you, I will never deny you.
In my Father's house there are many mansions.
If it were not so, I would have told you.
I am going to prepare a place for you there.
Speak plainly and speak no proverbs.
How are we to know where you're going?
I am the way, and the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father but by me.
Take it, and eat.
This is my body, which is being given for you.
Do this in remembrance of me.
Drink this.
For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many for the forgiveness of sins.
I have greatly desired to eat this Passover with you... before I suffer.
I tell you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
A new commandment I give unto you:
That you love one another... even as I have loved you.
Do quickly what you have to do.
Now is the Son of Man glorified.
I am going to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray.
Master, they may come for you there.
Why must you go?
A grain of wheat, Andrew, is just a grain of wheat.
But if it is put into the ground and dies, many will be born in its name, many will live.
Do you hear it?
I don't hear anything.
That's what I mean.
It's the best sound of all.
 Where several are gathered
together in my name, there will I be.
Judas Iscariot, sit down.
Hold out your hand.
Keep watch.
Father, save me from this hour.
O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me.
For this cause... I came into this world.
I came into this world... at your will.
I am ready... to leave it so.
O my Father, if this cup cannot pass away from me, lest I drink it... your will be done.
I don't want the money.
Give it, then, to the poor.
The hour has come.
Asleep, Peter?
Could you not watch with me one hour?
The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.
Judas!
- No, Peter. Put back your sword.
- Master!
For all that take the sword shall perish by the sword.
All my life,
I have walked in the light and spoken in the light.
Why now do you come and take me like a thief in the night?
His name is Jesus.
He comes from Nazareth in Galilee.
He is here now charged with the crimes of sedition, sorcery and blasphemy.
Jesus of Nazareth, your crimes are so many, I scarcely know where to begin.
But before I do begin, is there any statement you would like to make to these honourable men here?
- Very well, then. Let us proceed.
- Let the first witness enter.
Do you know this man Jesus of Nazareth?
I do.
Is he the one, then, who used his sorcery on you?
Sorcery?
I don't know about sorcery.
All I know is,
I was blind and now I see.
What did he do to you? How did he give you the use of your eyes?
If you knew where he came from, you would know how he did it.
We know where he came from.
He came from Galilee.
So just answer the question, please.
I have been blind since the day of my birth.
Jesus gave me sight.
That's all I know.
By your answer that we do not know where he came from, are we to assume that you believe... he was sent by God?
I believe if God was not in him, he would not have been able to make me see.
But have you considered that it is the Evil One in him, and the Evil One who made you see?
But why?
Why should the Evil One permit me, after so many years of darkness, to see the goodness and the beauty of God's world?
Take him out.
Aren't you a friend of the Nazarene?
Who?
Jesus. The one they have in there.
No. I don't know him.
- But you're a Galilean.
- Should I know every Galilean, then?
Sedition and sorcery are not your only crimes.
There is one far more horrendous than either of those.
You are charged with blasphemy.
Will you favour us at least once with your answer to this?
Do you deny that you have blasphemed?
Question those who have heard me.
They know what I have said.
You say to question those who have heard you. I will indeed.
- Many people will testify to your evil.
- What are you doing?
Nicodemus, it's good to have you with us.
Oh? Is that why I and other members of the Sanhedrin have not been informed of these proceedings?
We had to move swiftly.
There was no time to notify everyone.
No time?
But I see Lord Sorak, who lives in Emmaeus.
I see Lord Annas, who lives a farther distance than I.
But you say there was no time for Nicodemus, who lives right here in Jerusalem, who only lives a shouting distance from this very place?
Is my good friend
Joseph of Arimathea... present?
No. I thought not.
But many of the Sanhedrin aren't here.
Yes. Yes, that is quite true, Lord Caiaphas.
Those who think as I do are absent, and those who think as you do are present.
We are trying this man for blasphemy, my Lord Nicodemus. Please be seated.
I will not be seated.
Are we... are we all Romans now, that we disregard decency and justice, hold secret courts and try innocent men in the dead of night?
Nicodemus...
What you are doing is unlawful,
Lord Caiaphas.
This man is guilty of blasphemy,
Lord Nicodemus!
Jesus of Nazareth, I adjure you, by the living God, by the Almighty, that you tell us if you be the Christ, the Son of God.
Are you the Christ?
Are you the Son of God?!
I am.
- Blasphemy!
- Blasphemy!
- Blasphemy!
- Blasphemy!
Here's the order, sir, for your signature.
What has he been found guilty of that it cannot wait until a decent hour?
He has been found guilty, sir, of sedition, sorcery, blasphemy and open rebellion.
You claim to be the Son of God?
Which one? Hm?
Mars?
Hercules? Jupiter?
Which god are you the son of?
The Lord our God is one.
One?
For all people?
For Rome?
All nations shall be gathered before him.
He loves you no less than he loves others.
Then why have I not known him?
You have not looked for him.
I am going to ask you - and before you answer, remember that I have the power either to set you free or put you to death on the cross - if you are the son of your God, and king, where is your kingdom that Rome hasn't heard of it?
My kingdom is not of this world.
Oh?
Then what are you doing here?
I came into this world that I might give witness to what is true, and every man who loves the truth listens to me.
Truth?
What is truth?
I find no guilt in him.
Galilee is Herod's province, so take him to Herod. This is his business.
Your Majesty?
So you are the Jesus of Nazareth.
I thought you might be John the Baptist, come back from the dead.
I hear you perform miracles.
I am told you do all manner of marvels, things which... defy reason.
I do not believe you can do any of these things.
Let me see one of these miracles.
Impostor.
You cannot, but I can.
Do you know that I, "The Fox", can raise one finger... and a man will lose his head?
Now you are the king you were born to be.
"From you, Bethlehem, shall he come forth that is to be ruler in all Israel."
- Pilate sent him to me?
- Yes.
Pilate was loath to order the execution of your subject.
You're a liar. Pilate does not so favour me.
Take him back.
 For God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten son,
that whosoever believeth in him
should not perish
but should have everlasting life.
You're a friend of this Galilean's!
You're mistaken! I don't know him!
Hail, Pilate.
Hail, Pilate.
Behold the man!
Crucify him!
Crucify him.
Release him!
As your governor,
I represent the responsibility of Rome.
It is my duty to administer her justice to these prisoners.
This man has been brought here as one who perverts the law.
So this court will, therefore, scourge and chastise him.
- Release him!
- Crucify him!
No!
It is again my duty to remind you... that it is the benevolent custom of Rome to grant amnesty to one prisoner of your choosing... on each anniversary of the Passover.
Therefore, I will release unto you, completely free to go his way, the prisoner of your choice.
- Barabbas.
- Barabbas.
Barabbas!
No!
Barabbas?
Who is held on a charge of murder?
Him you want released?
Give us Barabbas!
No!
Release him!
- What shall I do with this man?
- Crucify him!
Release him!
He's a good man, the Nazarene.
He walks in God's light.
You're talking treason!
The man's a traitor!
And you must be a traitor, too, if you like him so much. Crucify him!
- Crucify him!
- Save him!
Have you no answer for these things they accuse you of?
Have you not one thing to say in your own behalf?
My kingdom is not of this world.
Blasphemer!
Any man who claims to be a king is defying Caesar.
We have no king but Caesar!
- We have no king but Caesar!
- Hail, Caesar.
Hail, Caesar!
Crucify him! Crucify him!
- Release him!
- Crucify him!
We have no king but Caesar!
It is ordered:
To the cross with the prisoner.
Suffered under Pontius Pilate,
was crucified, dead and buried.
Do not weep for me.
Weep for yourselves, and for your children.
For a time is coming when men will say
"Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore a child."
And they will say to the mountains
"Fall on us," and to the hills "Cover us."
For if these things are done when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?
Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.
Mother!
There is your son!
There is your mother.
He trusted in God.
Let God deliver him now.
If you're the Son of God, save yourself.
- Save us!
- We deserve our punishment.
For us, it is justice.
But this man has done nothing wrong.
Jesus, remember me when you come to your kingdom.
I tell you this, today... you shall be with me in paradise.
My God!
My God!
Why hast thou forsaken me?
I thirst.
It is finished.
Father, into thy hands...
I commit... my spirit.
Truly, this man was the Son of God.
It has been pointed out that Jesus tread the path of prophecy. That is why...
Your prophecies mean nothing but trouble.
That is why we are asking that you place a guard around the tomb.
A guard around a dead man's tomb?
If his body is stolen in the night, the people will proclaim that the prophecy has been fulfilled, that the Messiah has risen.
Mm.
Which of you is Joseph of Arimathea?
I am.
- This is your tomb?
- It is.
- Has the Nazarene been laid there?
- By permission of your commander.
 I have been wondering all night
about something. The prophecy...
 Don't talk to me
about prophecy!
I've heard enough about prophecy.
When he is killed, after three days he will rise again.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the tomb, Thomas.
Why?
He is gone.
Why seek ye the living among the dead?
~ And He shall reign for ever and ever
He is risen.
He is risen. He is risen!
~ King of Kings
~ For ever and ever
~ Hallelujah, hallelujah!
~ And Lord of Lords
~ For ever and ever
~ Hallelujah, hallelujah!
~ And He shall reign...
He's gone.
The body disappeared in the night.
- Are you sure?
- I saw for myself. The tomb is empty.
- Did you question the soldiers?
- Yes. They saw nothing at all.
- Were they asleep?
- They swear not.
Of course they do. The Roman punishment for sleeping on duty is death.
Incredible.
In any case, the whole thing will be forgotten in a week.
I wonder.
~ And He shall reign for ever and ever
~ And He shall reign for ever...
Go now, and teach all nations.
Make it your first care to love one another, and to find the Kingdom of God, and all things shall be yours... without the asking.
Do not fret, then, over tomorrow.
Leave tomorrow to fret over its own needs.
For today, today's troubles are enough.
And lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.
~ For ever and ever
~ For ever and ever
~ Hallelujah, hallelujah!
~ Hallelujah, hallelujah!
~ Hallelujah!

{7458}{7508}Have you read their exact words?
{7510}{7545}King Ibn Saud:
{7555}{7592}"There are 50 million Arabs.

{8090}{8172}Our children don't believe in Santa Claus,|not anymore.
{8198}{8301}We need, immediately,|an experienced military adviser.
{8325}{8403}We've come to you because,|frankly, no one else wants the job.
{8525}{8602}At least you're an honest man|but I've just done a war and a half.
{8604}{8652}I promised the next war to my wife.
{8669}{8762}I think if I leave home once more,|I'll find my pajamas on the front porch.
{8810}{8893}Would you give up everything you love|to fight an insane war...
{8895}{8972}...for a country that'll get|its brains blown out in a few weeks?
{8980}{9012}If it were my country.
{9038}{9114}Maybe it's yours, but it isn't mine.
{9126}{9157}But you're a Jew.
{9202}{9284}I'm an American, Major.|That's my religion.
{9285}{9349}The last time I was in temple,|I was 13 years old.
{9354}{9430}I made a speech and got 42 fountain pens.|I don't have to go again.

{9525}{9560}Here you are.
{9566}{9628}Colonel, I'm asking you, as an American.
{9630}{9693}What do you say in your schools|when you salute your flag?
{9695}{9764}"Liberty and justice for all"?|Is it only for all of you?
{9765}{9822}Don't give me history lessons!
{9871}{9937}Six million of our people|have recently been murdered.
{9956}{10007}Would you like us to try for seven?
{10297}{10325}Hi!

{10642}{10673}Thank you.
{10743}{10789}What's my other surprise?
{10844}{10913}I know I'm breaking a promise to you,|but...
{10932}{10992}...I'm leaving for Palestine next month.
{11016}{11048}Palestine?
{11070}{11095}Yeah.
{11101}{11169}Military adviser to the underground forces.
{11192}{11228}But why there and why you?
{11277}{11352}I happen to know a great deal|about the business of killing...
{11354}{11465}...and they've been killed by experts.|Somebody's got to help them fight back.
{11502}{11548}I guess I'm proud of you...
{11576}{11641}...but I'm so damn tired|of being proud of you.
{11698}{11751}Believe me, Emma, I|tried to get out of it...
{11753}{11811}...but I couldn't turn this one down.
{11821}{11865}Not these people. Not now, when they...
{11867}{11907}Be honest, darling.
{11916}{11957}At least be honest.
{11972}{12028}You've been out of uniform six months.
{12038}{12129}If they hadn't come looking for you,|you'd have started your own war.
{12234}{12264}You have to admit...
{12276}{12369}...I found a war in a country|that's pretty hard for you to knock.
{12378}{12476}Wait till I get my hands on|whoever's running the world.
{12483}{12530}I thought it was your mother.
{12586}{12653}Don't you think I know|what's going to happen in Palestine?
{12687}{12736}The end of the world, Mickey.
{12745}{12792}They don't stand a chance.
{12809}{12865}They'll be dying by the thousands, and...
{12885}{12930}And you right with them.
{12950}{12996}What makes it so terrible...
{13029}{13073}...is that's what you want.
{13092}{13118}Not me.
{13155}{13182}That.
{13269}{13296}Emma.
{13365}{13398}Are you crying?
{13449}{13484}You never cry.
{13618}{13660}I'm all right now.
{13694}{13796}I just had the awful feeling|this had all happened before somewhere.
{13834}{13901}That nightclub in Washington|during the war...
{13934}{13993}I knew then you were never coming back...
{14003}{14046}...just as I know it now.
{14073}{14138}And maybe it's the same|"not coming back. "
{14162}{14204}Maybe it's all one.
{14232}{14273}Maybe this is the time.
{14314}{14381}{Y:i}It was a nolsy war, that one.
{14386}{14433}{Y:i}Everyone danced a lot...
{14439}{14479}{Y:i}...and drank a lot...
{14492}{14545}{Y:i}...and loved a lot.
{14554}{14661}{Y:i}Some fellows even loved thelr own wlves.|They were the worst klnd.
{14679}{14764}If anything goes wrong,|I want you to know it was my own idea.
{14771}{14814}Nobody said I had to go.
{14816}{14869}That was their first mistake.
{15186}{15237}What did it this time, Mickey?
{15242}{15277}What really did it this time?
{15279}{15352}Did somebody say something|about your hiding behind a desk?
{15383}{15418}Something like that.
{15451}{15477}No.
{15490}{15587}I don't think that's all it is.|It happens too often.
{15599}{15634}Maybe it's...
{15648}{15681}Maybe it's...
{15705}{15757}What's that corny old verse?
{15776}{15828}"I have a rendezvous with Death
{15864}{15941}"At some disputed barricade
{15970}{16023}"When Spring...
{16025}{16058}"When Spring comes

{16264}{16352}At school we always said the fellow|who wrote that just had hay fever.
{16409}{16458}What's your sickness, Mickey?
{16558}{16597}When do you leave?
{16629}{16660}Tomorrow.
{16702}{16773}It wasn't Gen. Sherman|who said, "War is hell. "
{16775}{16817}It was Mrs. Sherman.
{16840}{16873}To Mrs. Sherman.
{16934}{16989}{Y:i}A few days later,|there was a note from you:
{16990}{17055}{Y:i}"Arrlved In England safely. Don't worry. "
{17073}{17111}{Y:i}Of course I dldn't worry.
{17113}{17187}{Y:i}I knew they wouldn't dare|start D-day wlthout you.
{17231}{17304}Gen. Randolph, Col. Marcus, sir.
{17321}{17414}The Pentagon has directed me to request|transportation across the channel, sir.
{17416}{17477}What does Washington|think I'm running out here, Marcus?
{17479}{17526}A taxicab service to France?
{17530}{17635}I agree with you, but I have orders|to reach the continent as soon as possible.
{17639}{17722}We're about to start an invasion.|Who ever issued such idiotic orders?
{17726}{17814}The handwriting's not so good,|but I think you'll recognize the signature.
{17845}{17875}I'II...
{17986}{18033}All right, Col. Marcus.
{18069}{18147}Some day next week|when the beachhead is secured...
{18160}{18234}...I shall inform Maj. Foley|at staff headquarters...
{18236}{18290}...that you are to be given VIP treatment...
{18299}{18357}- What I had in mind...|... boat trip to France...
{18359}{18429}...tour of the boys|on the fighting front and all of that.
{18435}{18470}Thank you, sir.
{18552}{18585}And, Marcus...
{18594}{18667}I remember you|from the Tennessee maneuvers.
{18682}{18799}Don't try to capture the opposing general.|This one's name is Rommel.
{18804}{18874}I don't think he'll make|the same mistake I did...
{18876}{18928}...and he isn't using blanks.
{19646}{19712}All right, men. Here we go.
{19791}{19821}Stand up.
{19876}{19905}Hook up.
{19985}{20025}Stand in the door.
{20062}{20097}Okay, let's go.
{20448}{20499}What's wrong, soldier?|Haven't you ever jumped?
{20501}{20523}No!
{21382}{21437}We're the first Allied|soldiers they've seen.
{21450}{21473}Pass the word:
{21475}{21571}Keep smiling and waving,|or they'll think the Nazis are back.
{21678}{21732}Welcome to our country.|What took you so long?
{21734}{21773}Stop the jeep. Stop it.
{21790}{21818}Back up.
{21820}{21872}Back it up. Back up.
{21982}{22020}Welcome, General.
{22033}{22121}Thank you, Col. Marcus, for the bouquet.
{22122}{22177}- What are you doing here?|- You saw my orders.
{22184}{22238}I certainly did, and I checked on them.
{22240}{22296}You were due back|at your desk a week ago.
{22297}{22379}I have four top-priority messages|from the Pentagon...
{22386}{22452}...to ship you home|on the first available transportation.
{22458}{22557}- How did you get into France?|- I jumped, sir, badly.
{22575}{22605}I'll bet.
{22629}{22700}Who gave you authority|to fly a combat mission?
{22707}{22824}I merely repeated your instructions, sir,|that I was to be given the VIP treatment.
{22869}{22943}Col. Marcus,|would you mind explaining to me...
{22945}{23022}...how you arrived in|this particular area...
{23024}{23072}...before the whole U. S. Army?
{23080}{23121}Yes, sir. We missed our drop zone.
{23123}{23183}We were up in the hills|when the Nazis pulled out.
{23205}{23252}We saw lots of guys die in the last week.
{23254}{23317}I thought there might be|something to drink in this town.
{23319}{23365}- Got your bellyful?|- No, sir.
{23369}{23452}We've been knocking off guys|who were making soap out of my relatives.
{23454}{23505}I don't ever want to get behind that desk...
{23531}{23591}Get down! He's on the clock. Get him.
{23805}{23841}Dirty Kraut.
{23905}{23944}Cut that man down.
{23946}{23994}- Capt. Billings!|- Yes, sir.
{23996}{24048}Clean out every building on this square.
{24057}{24084}Yes, sir.
{24095}{24132}That was close.
{24156}{24219}Did you find anything to drink around here?
{24264}{24305}I don't mean water.
{24313}{24354}I don't mean water.
{24516}{24547}You're right.
{24552}{24581}Thanks.
{24597}{24706}Arrest this officer, take him to the rear,|and put him on the first air transport out.
{24708}{24744}You must be joking.
{24746}{24829}If I were running the Pentagon,|I'd have you stood up against a wall.
{24849}{24901}Instead, they'll probably|pin a medal on you.
{24912}{24973}Have you ever heard|of the word "discipline"?
{24980}{25075}A staff officer acting like a kid|playing cowboys and Indians...
{25077}{25148}...is an example that might cost us|a few thousand lives.
{25162}{25225}What are you trying to prove, Marcus?
{25291}{25333}I wish to hell I knew, sir.
{25341}{25392}{Y:i}I wlsh to hell I knew, slr.
{25435}{25481}{Y:i}I wlsh to hell I knew.
{25525}{25569}{Y:i}I wlsh to hell I knew.
{25837}{25865}Mickey.
{26161}{26190}Mickey.
{26205}{26252}Why don't we get a divorce?
{26274}{26300}What?
{26317}{26405}I don't want a divorce,|but a girl has to have some pride.
{26422}{26463}What are you talking about?
{26490}{26536}We haven't really had a marriage.
{26553}{26615}It's been more like|the world's longest affair.
{26624}{26689}So why not be sensible?|Just cut the whole thing.
{26692}{26773}We can just go to bed together|every time you pass through New York.
{26782}{26853}That's a great proposition|from your own wife!
{26879}{26914}Emma.
{26927}{26960}I told you...
{26987}{27042}...we're starting the marriage right now.
{27045}{27084}I'm staying here.
{27133}{27157}No.
{27165}{27200}You're going.
{27219}{27292}I have to send you off|to your flea-bitten war.
{27294}{27361}It gets you more excited than I do,|doesn't it?
{27363}{27464}- That's a hell of a thing to say right now.|- It's true.
{27537}{27614}If I tried to keep you here,|our marriage wouldn't have a prayer...
{27616}{27651}...if it still has one.
{27689}{27789}I'm not going to lock you in a cage|and let the relatives throw you peanuts.
{27833}{27866}The family hero...
{27889}{27988}And have you hate me for keeping you|from trying to get yourself killed.
{28013}{28055}I love you too much.
{28189}{28301}Someday, you're going to find|whatever it is you're looking for.
{28305}{28365}Then you're really going to come home.
{28482}{28557}Did you ever notice|we don't have any children?
{28601}{28630}Only me.
{28697}{28754}I'd like so much to have your child.
{28787}{28877}I was the only girl in Brooklyn|who didn't get pregnant during the war.
{28885}{28944}My mother kept the statistics.
{29041}{29101}What kind of a father would I make now?
{29142}{29230}- Maybe when everything's right...|- Everything's never going to be right...
{29244}{29277}...for anybody.
{29295}{29338}But they still have children...
{29374}{29412}...and I want yours.
{29425}{29451}Ours.
{29519}{29544}Now.
{29623}{29722}There's a chance, isn't there,|I might never have you again?
{30261}{30320}You always come barging|into the Pentagon...
{30321}{30375}...asking a question|on a life-or-death matter...
{30377}{30436}...to be answered in exactly two minutes.
{30442}{30501}I'd just be an adviser.|It's headquarters stuff.
{30502}{30594}You couldn't advise a taffy pull|without slugging somebody.
{30601}{30642}I know it's touchy.
{30677}{30748}What's our official policy|in the Middle East?
{30774}{30833}This afternoon or this morning?
{30840}{30934}There's good military reason for remaining|friendly with the Arab governments...
{30936}{30986}...and none for loaning a reserve officer...
{30988}{31062}...as military adviser|to a pipsqueak nation...
{31064}{31121}...that'll be blown off the map on May 15.
{31135}{31184}You can't put out all the fires.
{31200}{31241}Suppose I go as a private citizen?
{31243}{31324}Then don't involve the Army in any way.|Don't use your rank...
{31325}{31362}...or even your right name.
{31364}{31422}Is it all right with you|if I keep the same sex?
{31465}{31539}Colonel, I am not requesting you|not to go...
{31541}{31583}...I am ordering you not to go.
{31593}{31654}That's the best|damn reason I've heard yet for going.
{31766}{31873}You're going to get yourself killed someday|sticking your neck out.
{31887}{31927}I can hardly wait.
{31961}{31999}Thank you, General.
{32710}{32757}You sure this passport's okay?
{32759}{32812}It must be. You're the fourth one to use it.
{33030}{33097}- Mr. Michael Stone?|- Yes, sir.
{33101}{33157}For what purpose|are you entering Palestine?
{33159}{33189}Pleasure.
{33196}{33279}This is hardly a pleasant country just now.|You've chosen an odd time.
{33287}{33329}Some of us have odd pleasures.
{33351}{33399}Where will you be staying?
{33405}{33435}Tel Aviv...
{33446}{33473}...with relatives.
{33475}{33520}Somebody's supposed to be|meeting me here.
{33521}{33569}- Indeed?|- Michael!
{33570}{33641}Mike, it's so good to see you after so long.
{33722}{33777}I'm sorry. I'm very late. How are you?
{33779}{33813}How do I look?
{33815}{33886}Tired, like you've been making love|to all the girls in America.
{33889}{33936}It's good to be back.
{33992}{34045}Welcome to the promised land,|Col. Marcus.
{34086}{34118}Thank you.
{34351}{34399}If he knew, why didn't he stop me?
{34401}{34463}Some of the British are angels,|the rest are bastards.
{34465}{34520}You were lucky. Probably he's with us.
{34568}{34613}Is that a bus or a tank?
{34616}{34659}A little bit of each.
{34830}{34893}{Y:i}- Shalom, Yaakov.|- Shalom, Magda.
{34895}{34939}By the way, what's your name?
{34941}{34993}- Magda Simon.|- Magda.
{35001}{35087}You'll live at our apartment.|It's better if the British ask questions.
{35089}{35134}From now on, I'm your sister.
{35166}{35250}That's nice. What's the attitude on incest|in this country?
{35270}{35306}Very biblical.
{35379}{35489}Especially since I'm also married.|My husband is an officer in the Palmach...
{35510}{35559}...but you can try if you wish.
{35561}{35608}It makes life interesting.
{36137}{36185}{Y:i}- Shalom, Magda.|- Shalom, Rona.
{36754}{36780}Here.
{36806}{36846}This, there.
{36889}{36916}What'd she say?
{36918}{36979}Never mind. You wouldn't do it anyway.
{38811}{38854}Rona! Rona!
{38856}{38887}She's hit.
{38902}{38941}Give me a bandage.
{39060}{39150}I wrote the book on this gun, and I don't|like girls fighting my wars for me.
{39152}{39204}She's not fighting for you.|It isn't your war.
{39205}{39252}Why do you turn everything|into a meeting?
{39253}{39282}Look, I'm sorry.
{39284}{39345}You don't understand a word|I'm saying, but I'm sorry.
{39353}{39384}Go to hell!
{39752}{39824}- David, why do you people take this?|- What do you mean?
{39825}{39876}Send out some men|and wipe out that town!
{39878}{39964}- Battles aren't won from inside a bus.|- The British are still in control.
{39966}{40051}We're not even supposed to have|these guns. It's punishable by death.
{40053}{40107}Then at least die standing up.
{40130}{40168}Sometimes we do.
{40219}{40277}In the Negev,|Egyptian tanks, armor and artillery...
{40279}{40370}...are ready to roll across the border|against us. Number unknown.
{40392}{40468}In Jerusalem,|4,000 of the Grand Mufti's men...
{40475}{40518}...already brought the city under fire.
{40520}{40593}They're trying to close the road|that connects it with Tel Aviv.
{40607}{40666}Our convoys are being ambushed,|with terrible losses.
{40679}{40720}Somewhere in Jordan...
{40739}{40841}...the Arab Legion:|British-armed, British-officered.
{40845}{40898}The best-equipped|force in the Middle East...
{40900}{40941}...apart from my wife's family.
{40953}{41032}Since the United Nations|voted for partition...
{41034}{41089}...the British are leaving, slowly...
{41091}{41180}...turning over their fortified positions|to all the Arabs in this country...
{41189}{41222}...who've never loved us.
{41224}{41270}We're outnumbered 60-to-1...
{41282}{41356}Pardon me, 60-to-2, now that you're here.
{41367}{41438}What would the Pentagon|suggest we do, Mr. Stone?
{41448}{41508}Teach them to love you, fast.
{41585}{41621}Wait a minute.
{41651}{41732}Asher, you've told me everything,|except what I want to know:
{41733}{41798}The disposition of your own army,|the Haganah.
{41820}{41880}They have a mean disposition, Mr. Stone.
{41881}{41929}Certainly you must have heard that.
{41945}{41992}Don't you want to tell me?
{42011}{42076}I'm not quite sure|what you need that information for.
{42077}{42143}As I understand it,|you're a lawyer in the American army...
{42145}{42216}...judge advocate's office,|behind a desk, unless I'm mistaken.
{42311}{42395}Asher... Is that really your first name?|Asher?
{42397}{42437}Yes, that really is my first name.
{42453}{42509}Asher, take that chip off your shoulder.
{42511}{42548}If you know so much about me...
{42549}{42653}...you may know that I toured this entire|area with Gen. Marshall after the last war.
{42661}{42732}I know the Arab leaders hate each other|more than they hate you.
{42734}{42813}Their soldiers have nothing to die for|and don't trust each other.
{42827}{42899}If you people can pull together,|you have a fighting chance.
{42926}{43023}But it's going to take organization|and an operational plan of battle.
{43042}{43137}I happen to serve on the general staff|of the largest army in the Western world.
{43141}{43213}Whatever I learned behind that desk...
{43226}{43262}...might be useful to you.
{43290}{43349}Now, do you want me to go or stay?
{43405}{43448}I haven't unpacked my bags.
{43450}{43507}You must be hungry. It's nearly 3:00 a. m.
{43509}{43566}I'm sorry, vegetables and sour cream.
{43581}{43611}You see...
{43623}{43670}...most of our people are vegetarians.
{43672}{43728}They've seen too many slaughterhouses|of every kind.
{43729}{43805}- You haven't answered my question.|- Yes, I have.
{43852}{43907}We need all the help we can get.
{44000}{44039}All right, Asher.
{44091}{44123}Let's level.
{44125}{44208}You and your Haganah|can't win this fight sitting in a cellar.
{44229}{44321}I understand your commandos,|the Palmach, are already on the attack.
{44322}{44347}Before they're ready.
{44349}{44433}Their leaders are too impulsive|and their training is a walk after lunch.
{44469}{44543}Okay, let's take inventory.|You've got no guns.
{44545}{44609}You've got no uniforms.|You've got no rank...
{44612}{44666}...and had less maneuvers|than our Campfire Girls.
{44668}{44733}Your Palmach and your Haganah|hate each other's guts.
{44734}{44794}And in three months' time,|the roof caves in.
{44796}{44849}What've you been|doing here the last 50 years?
{44850}{44886}If you have an army, where is it?
{44888}{44933}Asher! Asher!
{44949}{44993}{Y:i}- They've spotted the Ashkelon.|- Already?
{44995}{45065}British troops are going to the beach|to stop the landing.
{45089}{45161}{Y:i}- What's the Ashkelon?|- It's Andre's ship, my husband.
{45164}{45212}She's full of immigrants|looking for a home.
{45215}{45288}They slipped by the British at night.|We thought they were safe.
{45290}{45339}Palmahim Beach will be the landing area.
{45341}{45384}Tell all the girls, get on the phones.
{45385}{45479}Mr. Stone, if you'll come with me,|we'll show you the invisible.
{47565}{47592}Magda!
{47621}{47648}Andre!
{47811}{47899}- Mr. Stone, my husband Andre.|- How do you do?
{47905}{47957}This is the fourth ship|he's brought through.
{47964}{48019}It wasn't just me.|There's an engine in the boat.
{48021}{48116}{Y:i}- Andre...|-No one Is to leave thls beach.
{48161}{48217}{Y:i}We are not the Gestapo,|ladles and gentlemen...
{48219}{48328}{Y:i}...there are laws of entry to thls country|whlch we are under orders to enforce.
{48525}{48593}{Y:i}Please do not make It necessary|for us to use our arms.
{48612}{48705}{Y:i}But those enterlng Illegally|must be sent back to awalt thelr permlts.
{48777}{48816}Look over there, sir.
{48818}{48884}Looks like Wembley Stadium getting out.
{48888}{48950}If they mix with the others,|we'll never sort them out.
{48953}{48979}{Y:i}Haltl
{48997}{49027}{Y:i}You therel
{49029}{49127}{Y:i}Clvlllans movlng down to the beach area,|stop and go back.

{49525}{49591}{Y:i}...are warned to remaln|separate from the others.
{49686}{49729}Let's change clothes!
{49735}{49802}- Change clothes!|- Change clothes!
{49804}{49844}Now let them sort us out.
{50284}{50380}{Y:i}All passengers from the Ashkelon|wlll step forward Immedlately...
{50396}{50480}{Y:i}...or I shall be forced|to order these men to open flre.

{52563}{52635}Now's the time to find out|if we're bloody Nazis or not.
{52706}{52752}Such a stubborn people.
{52822}{52875}All right, men, stand at ease.
{53244}{53309}Now I suppose they'll start dancing.
{53535}{53600}You see? This is my army.
{54173}{54240}- The camp of the Palmach...|- Your commandos.
{54241}{54303}...is in these mountains.|Mount Canaan, someplace.
{54305}{54400}- It has been secret even from me.|- That is a secret.
{54657}{54736}Remember, if we are stopped|by a British patrol...
{54738}{54793}...we are off for a weekend in the country.
{54797}{54837}And you're my sister.
{54906}{54963}Do you have good sex with your wife?
{54981}{55053}What goes on in that pretty head of yours?
{55073}{55124}Andre's not very good in bed.
{55129}{55205}Just close your eyes|and tell the doctor everything.
{55266}{55353}We will rendezvous at Madj El-Kurum,|10 kilometers from here.
{55363}{55405}Andre has gone ahead...
{55413}{55476}...so we'll be warned|if there is any trouble.
{55495}{55544}You're a very important man.
{55563}{55619}- And you resent it.|- Of course.
{55621}{55702}Andre is my husband.|He risked his life for a stranger.
{55729}{55806}I hope you are enjoying|your little adventure.
{55830}{55856}I am.
{55893}{55937}Andre has done enough.
{55941}{56030}You know, in this country,|it's unfortunately not unusual...
{56035}{56106}...but he has a number tattooed|on his right arm.
{56115}{56165}He escaped, one of the few.
{56178}{56245}I met him when I was running from Vienna.
{56263}{56299}He had no hope.
{56307}{56349}A dog has more hope.
{56358}{56453}So I gave him what hope was in me.|It was the least I could do.
{56483}{56517}I understand.
{56541}{56577}You couldn't.
{56585}{56655}You Americans,|how can you understand horror?
{56673}{56743}To you, horror is having a bathroom|outside the house.
{56745}{56796}You're from a country so rich...
{56817}{56869}...even your wars are rich wars...
{56873}{56932}Big guns, big airplanes.
{56945}{56992}Clean, clean wars.
{57065}{57113}{Y:i}Clean, clean wars.
{57161}{57235}Why this ride?|Why do you want 500 trucks?
{57267}{57325}Because I know you won't give me|500 ambulances.
{57343}{57425}I don't know how you talked yourself|out of the Pentagon again...
{57429}{57521}...and into Germany,|but while you're here, just do your job.
{57559}{57606}Sir, no one can do my job.
{57621}{57660}Why the hell not?
{57667}{57708}You told me to take a battalion in...
{57709}{57773}...and help liberate the first camps|that we came across.
{57775}{57871}That's right. Just give them all the food|they need and let them out.
{57873}{57938}You can't give people food|if they've forgotten how to eat.
{57941}{58000}You can't let them out anywhere|when they can't walk.
{58001}{58098}I've heard all the stories, but I haven't|seen anything to convince me...
{58100}{58165}General, will you get out|of this car for five minutes?
{58170}{58218}Is that an order, Colonel?
{58250}{58304}No, sir. It's a prayer.
{58581}{58612}Attention!
{59128}{59197}Those that are alive|weigh an average of 85 pounds.
{59271}{59353}Over there's a building|filled with ovens, still warm.
{59373}{59432}No one ever baked any bread in them.
{59841}{59932}Here, there are 3,200 corpses,|near as we can tell...
{59933}{59998}...that they didn't have time to bury.
{60096}{60145}- McCreedy!|- Yes, sir?
{60160}{60277}Give this insubordinate son of a bitch|every truck and blanket in the Third Army.
{60321}{60376}I don't care|who you have to steal them from.
{60378}{60406}Yes, sir.
{60467}{60520}{Y:i}Clean, clean wars.
{60539}{60625}{Y:i}So how could you know?|How could you belleve?
{60633}{60691}You couldn't ever understand.
{60705}{60748}Could you, Mr. Stone?
{60808}{60843}You're right.
{60897}{60941}I couldn't understand.
{60969}{61011}I never really could.
{61044}{61079}There's Andre.
{61253}{61280}Andre!
{61289}{61324}How are you? I've been worried.
{61326}{61363}{Y:i}Magda! Shalom!
{61365}{61437}- Everything all right?|- No problem yet.
{61439}{61472}{Y:i}- Hello.|- Shalom.
{61489}{61521}Who are your friends?
{61541}{61604}Ram Oren, commanding Yiftach Brigade|of the Palmach.
{61606}{61676}- Hello, Ram.|- No, that's Yussuf, his driver.
{61695}{61733}This one is Ram.
{61742}{61783}This must be the world's only army...
{61785}{61856}...where you can't tell the officers|without a program.
{61973}{62044}It must have lost something|in the translation.
{62390}{62465}They dance pretty well, for soldiers.|When do they train?
{62467}{62549}We leave the training for the Haganah.|We do the fighting.
{62590}{62654}The Palmach has never|lost an engagement, Mr. Stone.
{62658}{62729}Congratulations.|The party hasn't started yet.
{63105}{63144}Look, Arabs!
{63304}{63381}Those are our boys, dressed like|Arabs to infiltrate their lines.
{63397}{63436}It's a crazy army.
{63500}{63540}Let's join the army.
{63821}{63845}Ram!
{64187}{64235}Mr. Stone, can I talk to you?
{64265}{64316}That's not a bad way to train.
{64346}{64417}Our men tell me there's an old|Bedouin chief in the valley...
{64419}{64478}...who heard the Americans|sent us a great soldier...
{64481}{64573}...to help us fight in these hills.|General Eisenhower.
{64574}{64639}I don't quite have the|haircut for it, but...
{64641}{64719}We have explained,|it's another American officer of high rank.
{64730}{64781}- He wants to see you.|- Me?
{64783}{64852}He's says he's considering|fighting on our side.
{64853}{64900}We've got to see him.
{64994}{65056}I have no right|to ask you to come with me.
{65065}{65157}He's Arab.|If it is a trick, it could be dangerous.
{65159}{65213}All the more reason for me to go.
{65215}{65270}Convincing Arabs|is the least of my problems.
{67487}{67580}{Y:i}"I'm the shelk of Araby
{67584}{67674}{Y:i}"Your love belongs to me
{67676}{67764}{Y:i}"At nlght when you're asleep
{67766}{67854}{Y:i}"Into your tent I'll creep"
{67861}{67897}{Y:i}Hls Master's Volce.
{67912}{67996}Why do you lie to me? I am not a fool.
{68013}{68076}You tell me you're an officer|of the American army...
{68078}{68126}...but what proof do you have?
{68145}{68232}And you are the commander|of the Yiftach Brigade of the Palmach?
{68249}{68288}An infant like you?
{68345}{68405}- I'm second in command.|- You lie!
{68483}{68536}You are Ram Oren, the commander.
{68559}{68625}He thought he was too young|to impress you.
{68637}{68674}That shows that he is foolish.
{68676}{68750}The only thing that impresses|a man in my age is youth.
{68774}{68828}Don't you know|who Saman Abou Kader is?
{68841}{68910}When you were 3,|I was stealing cattle from your father.
{68921}{68975}There was a man. A lion!
{69001}{69034}He shot me twice...
{69037}{69106}...and we came to an agreement|of gentlemen.
{69109}{69180}I was a guest in your house.|I held you on my knee.
{69181}{69220}Twice you wet your pants and mine.
{69243}{69275}You have no honor.
{69277}{69324}It was an old Bedouin friend of my father's.
{69327}{69409}- I thought he died long ago.|- Hush, I am far from dead.
{69412}{69479}You can ask that bag of fat|who just danced for us.
{69481}{69573}I have risked my life to ask you here|because your father was a man to trust.
{69581}{69626}I had hopes his son was the same.
{69647}{69671}And you...
{69687}{69745}Why have you come to this country?
{69746}{69789}- To fight.|- With what?
{69805}{69885}- Have you brought guns from America?|- They will come.
{69887}{69934}Come back when they get here.
{69954}{69979}Wait a minute!
{69981}{70061}You didn't risk your life to invite us here|to dismiss us so quickly.
{70066}{70107}What's on your mind?
{70161}{70190}Coffee.
{70353}{70410}Why do you want to take our home away?
{70415}{70484}Our desert. We have lived here|for 1,000 years and more.
{70492}{70552}By what right? A Bible...
{70562}{70635}{Y:i}...that is more fairy tale|than the Arablan Nlghts?
{70649}{70715}From Damascus,|from Amman, from Cairo...
{70731}{70811}...they send messengers to tell me|the Jews will destroy our land...
{70813}{70866}...and ravish our women.|- How can you believe...
{70868}{70958}So I should send all my men at once|to the Grand Mufti's army.
{71030}{71089}- What answer do you have?|- Your own eyes.
{71090}{71128}They aren't destroying your land.
{71129}{71219}Even a blind man can see,|for the first time the desert is blooming.
{71222}{71301}They're not ravishing your women.|They don't even like your women.
{71302}{71397}That is not much of an answer.|They don't even like their women.
{71406}{71435}Listen...
{71453}{71533}...for 50 years|you have lived beside us without hate.
{71534}{71600}- Why now, a holy war?|- I'll tell you why:
{71601}{71661}The Grand Mufti, King Abdullah,|and the Husseinis...
{71663}{71714}...see the chance to win|money, power and land.
{71716}{71762}They're fighting to see who gets the most.
{71764}{71812}- That's true.|- So I'll get some, too.
{71813}{71866}They won't leave|one camel for your people.
{71868}{71906}You know them better than I.
{71908}{71978}You'll fight the war for them,|but when it's over...
{71980}{72029}...you'll be worse off than before.
{72032}{72072}Or you'll be dead.
{72077}{72138}I have no love for the Husseini family.
{72196}{72248}I'll support you with all of my men...
{72251}{72336}...if you can first prove to me|that you are strong like your father.
{72341}{72385}For then you will win.
{72392}{72473}How can I believe you? I need proof, too.
{72514}{72550}Wait a minute.
{72694}{72763}Across the border,|near the mosque of Mishmar Hayarden...
{72765}{72841}...the Syrians are gathering supplies|for an attack next week.
{72881}{72916}Eight hundred rifles.
{72972}{73019}Mortars, two-inch, 21.
{73072}{73140}Petrol, four tanks of 2,000 liters.
{73205}{73248}Three cannons of 75 millimeter.
{73301}{73350}We finish. Now your proof.
{73426}{73512}- The supplies will be destroyed.|- You're committing my men.
{73514}{73554}I don't care, it must be done.
{73556}{73613}You want to violate a border|without authority?
{73614}{73658}What do you want to do? Wait for a visa?
{73660}{73740}If it's used against you,|they can take half the Galilee in a week.
{73758}{73784}So, Commander?
{73991}{74058}It will all be destroyed within 24 hours.
{74067}{74128}Watch the sky toward Mishmar Hayarden.
{74249}{74279}Good night.
{74355}{74385}Pretty smart cookie.
{74387}{74478}Ram Oren, don't wet your pants again.
{74521}{74546}Come on.
{75053}{75114}Keep down. You should not have come.
{75116}{75197}- I have strict orders.|- My orders are to advise and observe.
{75207}{75276}I'm advising you,|it's stupid to attack with a single squad.
{75277}{75338}You know they have artillery.|You don't have armor.
{75340}{75408}This dynamite is our artillery,|and the night is our armor.
{75409}{75444}And the Lord is my Shepherd...
{75446}{75510}...but maybe he's their shepherd, too.|- You stay.
{75513}{75585}If so, there'll be a hell of a lot|of confused sheep.
{76949}{76976}Andre!
{80145}{80180}Ammunition has been blown up.
{80182}{80224}Good! They did it!
{80286}{80327}We have three dead.
{80331}{80378}Three dead? Who are they?
{80446}{80524}Eli, Tov, Andre.
{80546}{80602}Andre? Your husband?
{80688}{80735}Magda, are you all right?
{80757}{80782}Yes.
{80790}{80832}Yes, I'm all right.
{80942}{81015}I didn't come to Tel Aviv|to say things are peaches and cream.
{81017}{81084}You want the truth. Things are pretty bad.
{81088}{81135}How bad, in your opinion?
{81144}{81235}If the Arabs had a decent campaign plan,|and could attack in force tomorrow...
{81237}{81301}...they have the potential|to take Tel Aviv in 10 days.
{81305}{81388}- You had to bring me another expert.|- He doesn't only complain...
{81389}{81441}Everybody tells me the patient is dying.
{81443}{81525}The patient has already lived 2,000 years|after the doctors gave him up.
{81527}{81616}He won't live to be 2001|unless he follows directions on the label.
{81617}{81686}I can write the manuals|for you from memory.
{81689}{81748}Somebody has to convince|your officers to read them.
{81750}{81781}Go back into training.
{81783}{81830}You write, I'll convince.
{81838}{81898}You know the biggest weapon you have?
{81918}{82011}The guts, the tremendous guts|of those kids in torn sweaters...
{82013}{82056}...and open-toed sneakers.
{82077}{82112}Why throw away their lives...
{82113}{82188}...by supplying them with|bargain-basement guns or none at all?
{82189}{82254}Because your government|and the United Nations...
{82257}{82305}...have embargoed|all arms shipments to us...
{82307}{82366}...while the British can arm|our enemies openly.
{82368}{82407}We're lucky we have a few bargain...
{82409}{82460}No one ever won a war on excuses.
{82475}{82537}They told you|that I have a terrible temper?
{82553}{82624}I served in Germany|under General "blood-and-guts" Patton.
{82635}{82674}You're a pussycat.
{82734}{82797}You can't expect a boy to die|in somebody else's pants.
{82800}{82847}The Palmach fight barefoot in the hills...
{82849}{82903}...while the stores|in Allenby Road have sales.
{82905}{82986}I'm the unofficial minister of defense|of an unrecognized government.
{82988}{83047}I have no authority to requisition supplies.
{83049}{83108}If you can't get supplies,|break through the window...
{83109}{83159}...and take what you want.|Just remember...
{83161}{83206}...the world doesn't pity the slaughtered.
{83208}{83295}- It only respects those who fight.|- We haven't been fighting?
{83297}{83346}Not to win. Look, you're like this:
{83348}{83452}The Palmach, Haganah,|Irgun, Sterngang, government...
{83475}{83524}You're all pulling in every direction.
{83526}{83592}But if you can unify them|under one command...
{83594}{83665}...then you'll have one army|that can move fast and hit hard.
{83668}{83732}- You can help us do this?|- I don't know.
{83739}{83798}I don't know if anyone can.|There isn't much time.
{83800}{83888}But if you want to use me,|and gamble I know what I'm doing...
{83889}{83931}...then you must give me a free hand.
{83933}{84020}Absolute authority to consolidate|all your forces immediately.
{84029}{84116}- That's all you want?|- Yes, that's all I want.
{84193}{84268}You must understand|we're very new at this business.
{84271}{84373}Our Haganah and our Palmach|are wonderful, brave, boys and girls.
{84375}{84456}But, like children of the same family,|they're jealous of each other.
{84457}{84489}What about the other groups?
{84490}{84516}- The Irgun?|- Yes.
{84517}{84552}Also very brave.
{84553}{84625}Listens to no one,|conducts its own war against the British.
{84626}{84724}The Sternists? Brave.|And occasionally shoot at us, bravely.
{84750}{84833}We could have a very nice little war|here without the Arabs.
{84835}{84917}You want me to give you|absolute authority over all of them?
{84922}{84947}Yes.
{84980}{85052}If you can find out how to get it,|please let me know...
{85055}{85130}...because if, God forbid,|anything went wrong...
{85133}{85191}...it'd be nice to have an American|to blame it on.
{85283}{85368}- I guess the meeting's over.|- Look, try to understand.
{85369}{85437}We're in the importing business.|We import people.
{85439}{85516}That's the reason we're here.|We only fight because we have to.
{85518}{85597}We have no quarrel with the Arabs,|only with their leaders.
{85598}{85650}We still hope for an agreement.
{85652}{85716}{Y:i}The traditional greeting|in this country is "Shalom. "
{85717}{85745}Peace.
{85762}{85791}{Y:i}Shalom.
{85841}{85890}The olive branch hasn't worked|around here...
{85893}{85955}...since Noah ran the ark into a mountain.
{85961}{86052}Col. Marcus, don't think we're ungrateful.
{86067}{86112}You write those manuals.
{86117}{86174}Go, inspect. Go to the Negev.
{86176}{86232}Go especially with the convoys|to Jerusalem...
{86233}{86284}...for there is our greatest danger.
{86286}{86357}Make your reports,|your recommendations, please.
{86457}{86513}All right. I'll try it your way.
{86514}{86554}I'll advise. I'll observe.
{86556}{86621}You need a lot more than advice,|or the night of May 15...
{86623}{86674}...you'll be wading in the Mediterranean.
{86677}{86717}Maybe. Maybe not.
{86738}{86828}We might be even tougher pussycats|than anyone has any idea.
{86839}{86870}We'll see.
{86983}{87061}He's been in the Negev desert|on an inspection tour.
{87063}{87135}Next week, he's going|in a convoy to Jerusalem.
{87144}{87181}And he's dictating from memory...
{87183}{87249}...every army training manual|he can remember.
{87251}{87312}He says they need it more than the Bible.
{87315}{87416}Did he happen to mention who|he's dictating the Song of Solomon to?
{87435}{87483}What do you mean by that?
{87488}{87583}- Why should I repeat gossip?|- Why should you stop now?
{87605}{87640}Since you ask...
{87669}{87786}A very dear friend of mine got a letter|from a dear friend of hers in Palestine.
{87806}{87924}There's this woman, lost her husband.|He's been seen everyplace with her.
{87925}{87964}Magda Simon. I know.
{87965}{88065}Mickey wrote me about her.|She's been assigned to him by the army.
{88067}{88139}Instead of paying him? A nice army!
{88141}{88193}Mother, don't be a mother.
{88206}{88256}Besides, Mickey and I have...
{88287}{88355}- What's the matter?|- I don't know.
{88378}{88426}I don't know. A terrible pain.
{88429}{88456}I'll get the bicarbonate.
{88457}{88504}No, mother. Call the doctor.
{88508}{88568}- What kind of a pain?|- I... don't argue.
{88570}{88634}I think I'm losing the baby.
{88717}{88769}{Y:i}- Shalom, Magda.|- Shalom.
{88823}{88902}My family live in Jerusalem.|To them, chickens are better than gold.
{88904}{88968}Why do you let women|go on these convoys?
{88970}{89041}- Magda volunteered.|- She's been through enough.
{89043}{89083}She lost her husband, she's...
{89085}{89120}We need everyone.
{89121}{89180}Especially since the British|search us for weapons.
{89181}{89225}The British are usually too polite...
{89226}{89265}...to search a woman thoroughly.
{89267}{89326}You're lucky you're not occupied|by the French.
{91047}{91077}Get out!
{91796}{91855}- Can you see Magda?|- No.
{91891}{91956}- Let's stop!|- There's no stopping here.
{93473}{93512}The worst is over.
{93517}{93596}- Can you see Magda's truck?|- I think she stopped.
{93597}{93657}Now, hold it. Hold it.
{93989}{94016}Magda!
{94037}{94065}Come on!
{94081}{94117}Come on, Magda!
{94226}{94274}Magda! Come on!
{94306}{94345}Come on, Magda!
{94445}{94527}Come on, Magda!
{95127}{95157}Cover me.
{95432}{95500}Move over. Here, take this.
{95561}{95588}Magda?
{95651}{95703}Help me, Mickey! Help me!
{96873}{96900}Doctor!
{96932}{97014}Can you help her?|I don't understand Hebrew.
{97016}{97065}Asher, can you help me out?
{97068}{97121}He doesn't seem to understand|what I've said...
{97124}{97181}- Is she wounded?|- She's in shock.
{97182}{97269}Until the wounded are cared for,|we have no time for hysteria.
{97271}{97317}She needs a sedative, booze, anything.
{97318}{97394}- You saw what she went through.|- I'm sorry.
{97406}{97459}Listen, Asher, I don't mean to pull rank...
{97461}{97526}...but I'm here under orders|of the Minister of Defense.
{97528}{97585}Mr. Stone, we have no rank for you to pull.
{97587}{97655}The Minister of Defense is in Tel Aviv,|we're in Jerusalem...
{97657}{97701}...and this convoy's my responsibility.
{97702}{97774}Perhaps they handle things differently|at West Point, so...
{97785}{97851}...write me a training manual.|I hear you're good at it.
{98093}{98189}- But you're leaving us.|- I just got a letter from my wife.
{98198}{98301}She never likes to worry me,|but she admitted she's in the hospital.
{98303}{98366}I think it's more serious than she says.
{98368}{98421}I'm sorry your wife isn't well.
{98424}{98479}She certainly needs me|a lot more than you do.
{98481}{98551}- No, I think our need is greater.|- The hell it is.
{98559}{98606}I got to Jerusalem, and your commander...
{98608}{98679}...started looking for a vacant cross|to nail me to.
{98681}{98767}I turned in my draft of the training manuals|for your infantry a week ago.
{98769}{98855}It's still in your secretary's office|under a package of cheese.
{98872}{98924}Here are recommendations|for consolidating...
{98925}{99010}...the Palmach and Haganah|into one unified striking force.
{99019}{99061}Don't laugh too loud.
{99069}{99127}We have a few small problems, too.
{99145}{99220}The UN is having second thoughts|about granting us independence.
{99253}{99325}A lot of pressure's being brought to bear|to have us postponed.
{99327}{99374}A month, a year, forever.
{99384}{99438}- You're not going to?|- No.
{99459}{99577}Not if we can be sure the baby will be born|with at least one friend in the world.
{99605}{99636}Mickey...
{99650}{99724}- Lf the United States...|- Politics isn't my racket.
{99730}{99765}Not anymore.
{99777}{99840}And I finished my work as a paper soldier...
{99841}{99909}...and since that's the only work|you'll allow me to do...
{99913}{99983}...I think we'll all be a lot happier|if I go home.
{100012}{100064}I'm sorry to see you go, but...
{100097}{100126}{Y:i}...shalom.
{100133}{100160}Peace.
{100172}{100209}We should both live so long.
{100385}{100433}So you're really leaving?
{100497}{100542}You should be out cold.
{100544}{100599}Mrs. Martinson said|she gave you quite a shot.
{100609}{100668}I have so many, they don't work. Please.
{100681}{100747}- You'll go out like a light.|- A blessing.
{100820}{100925}While I was packing,|this fell out of a pocket.
{100955}{101005}It's my good-conduct ribbon.
{101142}{101187}But still you leave us.
{101245}{101322}I got this letter from my wife.|Nobody needs me here.
{101324}{101362}Don't give me ribbons.
{101364}{101424}I couldn't start the truck|because I didn't want to!
{101426}{101504}Because I wanted to run away!|And now you run away, just like me!
{101505}{101559}- You coward!|- Magda!
{101561}{101608}Come on, Magda!
{101614}{101674}Come on, Magda.
{101720}{101770}I'm sorry!
{101773}{101853}You have every right to go.|It's not your country.
{101856}{101940}Poor Andre, it was all the country he had...
{101943}{101992}...and for him, I couldn't cry.
{102015}{102073}Don't go. Stay.
{102076}{102152}Are you blind,|you stupid, married American idiot?
{102179}{102236}I am so tired of blood.
{102270}{102329}I am so tired of shooting.
{102367}{102432}I am so tired of wanting and not having.
{102471}{102524}Since you first came here, I...
{102560}{102607}No, not now.
{102609}{102646}It's not fair.
{102685}{102715}I want...
{102801}{102866}Damn you, Mrs. Martinson.
{103048}{103076}{Y:i}Shalom.
{103341}{103380}Keep the change.
{103550}{103615}- What's going on?|- Come on inside and find out.
{103689}{103730}If it isn't Errol Flynn!
{103737}{103812}It's a welcome-home party, Mickey.|All the relatives.
{103814}{103856}Give him a beer, will ya?
{103959}{103988}Mickey!
{104033}{104059}Emma.
{104085}{104154}Emma, I thought you were in the hospital.
{104156}{104213}Mickey, I'm so glad you're back.
{104305}{104356}- Come on, I want to talk to you.|- Okay.
{104364}{104399}Mickey!
{104417}{104507}A letter came for you yesterday|from the British Embassy in Washington.
{104509}{104537}It's marked "Personal. "
{104539}{104610}- What's it say?|- They're going to give you a medal for...
{104623}{104664}I'm only guessing.
{104963}{105011}I'm sorry I lost the baby.
{105049}{105084}I'm sorry, too.
{105112}{105169}I waited to write to you|till I was getting better.
{105171}{105253}- I knew you'd worry.|- Of course I'd worry.
{105260}{105312}It was my baby, too. Remember?
{105331}{105364}I remember.
{105393}{105435}If you'd written me when it happened...
{105437}{105501}...I could've come back|when it might've done some good.
{105505}{105566}Are you angry|because I'm not desperately sick?
{105570}{105594}Of course not.
{105596}{105660}But you could've answered my cable|to say you were fine.
{105666}{105751}- I gave up everything to rush here...|- All right, Mickey.
{105777}{105853}Part of my sickness was you,|that should be obvious.
{105885}{105924}I wanted you back.
{106073}{106136}I heard so many stories about you and...
{106174}{106216}Did you believe them?
{106244}{106308}I don't now. Now that you're here.
{106461}{106488}Mickey?
{106677}{106719}Why did you come home?
{106761}{106815}I was lonesome for your mother.
{106847}{106906}Don't hate me for loving you so much.
{107092}{107181}To Col. David Marcus,|for his able work in World War II...
{107183}{107255}...in the fields of combined planning|and military government...
{107257}{107366}...which paved the road for Anglo-American|agreement on many complex problems...
{107369}{107476}...His Majesty is glad to bestow the rank of|Honorary Officer of the Military Division...
{107479}{107556}...of the Most Excellent Order|of the British Empire.
{107613}{107648}Thank you, sir.
{107680}{107720}Congratulations, darling.
{107725}{107802}- I think this calls for a drink.|- Mr. Ambassador, my wife.
{107804}{107870}- How do you do?|- She drinks, too.
{107880}{107984}That's a fine tan you have there, Colonel.|Might I inquire where you got it?
{107985}{108061}- Traveling, Ambassador.|- Indeed?
{108074}{108154}- Any place I'd be interested in?|- You'd be interested in every place.
{108156}{108212}"The sun never sets on the British Empire. "
{108214}{108330}- Not if we can help it, it doesn't.|- Sometimes you can't help it.
{108333}{108365}But this time...
{108377}{108409}...Mr. Stone...
{108432}{108533}...I think your friends would realize|that we're only trying to be helpful.
{108571}{108671}A British military base in the Middle East|is a necessity for the free world.
{108700}{108757}If they insist on our forces|being withdrawn...
{108767}{108868}...your friends will be at the mercy|of terrible, powerful enemies...
{108886}{108953}...with legitimate claims|on their territory...
{108956}{109021}...and enough arms to overrun them|within a few days.
{109047}{109117}And they will find,|possibly to their surprise...
{109128}{109209}...that they're alone and friendless|in the practical political world.
{109210}{109281}No nation is going to risk|being the first to recognize...
{109282}{109352}...so weak and controversial a government.
{109397}{109427}They are...
{109446}{109486}...as the Bible says...
{109506}{109553}..."a stiff-necked people. "
{109605}{109705}Perhaps you could persuade them|that it's better to...
{109707}{109790}...bend a little, if those necks|are going to be saved at all.
{109905}{109937}Excuse me.
{110188}{110233}What was that all about?
{110255}{110332}I got this medal|because they don't trust Western Union.
{110449}{110507}They want me to deliver a message.
{110569}{110645}Listen, Mike, do you think|the United States...
{110648}{110765}...will ever recognize the new state,|when and if it's declared?
{110767}{110852}What the hell for?|What's in it for us but trouble?
{110871}{110944}Your friends may have the Bible|in their favor...
{110949}{110991}...but the Arabs have the oil.
{110993}{111086}Do you think our state department's|going to hesitate choosing up sides?
{111093}{111132}I guess you're right.
{111133}{111234}They're already putting the pressure|on your pals to postpone independence.
{111245}{111316}What's a few years,|a few centuries, to those people?
{111349}{111407}And I'm glad you finally got some sense...
{111418}{111471}...and pulled out before it was too late.
{111506}{111565}Now, listen, Mike, you bigoted, ignorant...
{111601}{111651}I'll try to enlighten|you, but I doubt I can...
{111653}{111734}...because you have no idea|of what the stakes are over there.
{111736}{111804}Here's a country|surrounded by five Arab nations...
{111805}{111864}...ready to shove them|into the Mediterranean.
{111865}{111921}No guns, no tanks, no friends, nothing.
{111923}{111985}People fighting with bare hands|for a piece of desert...
{111989}{112048}...because it's the last place|on this whole earth...
{112049}{112130}...that they can go to and try to live...|- Then why did you come back?
{112204}{112261}Wouldn't they let you play captain?
{112345}{112392}You know me too damn well.
{112428}{112474}You don't know me at all.
{112479}{112569}You don't give any of the rest of us credit|for being human beings.
{112578}{112628}I saw Dachau, too. Remember?
{112646}{112741}And if anybody ever deserved a home|on the basis of sheer gallantry...
{112744}{112802}...it's those poor devils from those camps.
{112809}{112855}And you have friends too, Mickey...
{112857}{112919}...although it'll probably|upset you to find it out.
{112932}{113051}They'll ring every doorbell in Washington|from the White House down, if it'll help.
{113056}{113090}And I'll raise such a stink...
{113092}{113166}...they'll go in and out|of the state department with gas masks.
{113170}{113206}But what about you?
{113211}{113275}Are you too big to go back|and help your own people...
{113277}{113340}...unless they bow down|and kiss your West Point ring?
{113345}{113372}Get off my back.
{113382}{113461}What happened|to that insubordinate SOB...
{113463}{113529}...that jumped out of one of my planes|over Normandy?
{113538}{113582}He won the distinguished service medal?
{113603}{113704}Are you proud of that medal, and|ashamed you might win the star of David?
{113749}{113786}Stand up and be counted, Mickey.
{113801}{113860}And there's a lot of us|who'll stand up with you.
{113873}{113897}{Y:i}L'Chalm.
{113962}{114030}Maybe you ought|to stay off our side, Mike.
{114036}{114085}Nobody will ever believe it.
{114107}{114136}{Y:i}L'Chalm.
{115664}{115692}Stone!
{115709}{115757}Hello, Asher. What's new?
{115826}{115921}- I never thought I'd see you again.|- It's a surprise to both of us.
{115923}{116037}My apologies for the airport.|The Arab Legion took Lydda two days ago.
{116041}{116072}I'll bet.
{116091}{116132}So you're back. Why?
{116149}{116197}Never mind. We're glad to have you.
{116221}{116296}I hope you mean that,|'cause I'm staying, even if you don't.
{116298}{116336}Haven't you heard?
{116347}{116429}The Palmach and Haganah have accepted|your suggestions for unification.
{116436}{116500}And the old man has us|following your training program.
{116504}{116582}You and the Palmach sneered|at every suggestion I ever made.
{116584}{116636}Don't you realize who you're dealing with?
{116638}{116724}We have to pretend we know everything|because we know so little.
{116726}{116776}Everything'll be different from now on?
{116778}{116808}Of course not.
{116810}{116927}We'll criticize every suggestion you make,|but that doesn't mean we won't do it.
{116958}{117017}I'll bet if Moses came down|from Mount Sinai again...
{117019}{117070}...you'd turn down five|of the Commandments...
{117073}{117129}...just so God wouldn't get a swelled head.
{117161}{117208}Mick? Hang on to this.
{117229}{117301}It may be the only bourbon|between here and the next oasis.
{117302}{117356}I got the pilot in New Jersey,|plane in Burbank...
{117358}{117417}...license in Panama,|and the guns in Czechoslovakia.
{117419}{117466}It's a new kind of Foreign Legion.
{117469}{117549}Vince Ramondi, pride of Passaic,|Asher Gonen, pride of Tel Aviv.
{117551}{117647}{Y:i}According to my flight plan,|we're in Mexico City, so buenas noches.
{117657}{117709}Sorry,|I might have dented your plane landing.
{117711}{117767}Glad to have you and the plane|in any condition.
{117769}{117837}It's not much of a bargain.|It's leaking a lot of oil.
{117844}{117916}- And I'd fly for anybody who pays me.|- It doesn't matter.
{117918}{118015}- To us, you're a hero.|- Maybe that's why we're all here.
{118101}{118140}And furthermore...
{118154}{118231}...we've been told|that if we go through with our plan...
{118253}{118325}...the city of Tel Aviv|will be bombed tonight...
{118331}{118376}...by an enemy air force.
{118417}{118478}They may come over in great strength...
{118494}{118527}...and as yet...
{118533}{118601}...we are not equipped|to meet such an attack.
{118658}{118717}We've also received word|that the United Nations...
{118718}{118795}...would like to revise|its decision of November 29...
{118798}{118845}...granting us independence.
{118879}{118941}We have informed all nations concerned...
{118957}{119057}...that we consider the original decision|to be irrevocable!
{119313}{119423}Therefore, we members|of the people's council assembled here...
{119425}{119488}...on the day of the termination|of the British mandate...
{119491}{119559}...by virtue of our natural|and historic right...
{119597}{119699}...and on the strength of the resolution|of the United Nations General Assembly...
{119702}{119779}...do hereby declare|the establishment of the State of Israel!
{121682}{121735}"The United States of America...
{121746}{121836}"... is proud to be the first nation|to recognize the new State of Israel...
{121839}{121886}"... and welcomes you. "
{122424}{122454}Did you just hear that?
{122456}{122516}What's happened to our state department?
{122518}{122604}Somebody must have given|the White House their phone number.
{122621}{122684}And now, God help them...
{122690}{122761}...'cause that's all|the help they'll get from us.
{123471}{123541}Stop! How about some wine?
{123577}{123612}Here you are.
{123618}{123677}Come and get it! Wait a minute.
{123680}{123732}I'm getting off here to see a friend.
{123734}{123804}Don't leave me here! I'm anti-Semitic!
{123889}{123922}Propaganda!
{123953}{123989}Okay, let me out.
{124099}{124135}Magda!
{124184}{124217}Over here!
{124264}{124288}Mickey!
{124291}{124362}I heard you were here,|but you're so important now...
{124364}{124463}...you have only time for cabinet ministers.|Maybe if I get elected...
{124651}{124700}What are you crying about now?
{124701}{124750}You came back.
{124752}{124814}It's only supposed to make|the Arabs unhappy.
{124816}{124870}I thought all us cowards|would stick together.
{124872}{124938}You hate me. I was so stupid.
{124940}{125024}Magda, tonight I love the whole world.
{125076}{125184}Mickey, I waited so long.|I hoped... I didn't know...
{125789}{125875}Now, the Egyptian army's|pouring tanks across the desert.
{125920}{125999}The armies of five other Arab nations|have crossed our borders...
{126001}{126040}...from four different directions.
{126045}{126135}We have no tanks, no artillery|and almost no air force to stop them.
{126165}{126213}We're getting arms soon.
{126222}{126272}Somehow, for one week,|you must hold them.
{126273}{126326}Hold them? What are you talking about?
{126328}{126391}You've all got to stop thinking like losers.|Attack!
{126393}{126440}Surprise and bluff are your major weapons.
{126453}{126503}Attack tanks with what? Noodle soup?
{126519}{126614}I've been working over that new shipment|of jeeps that came in and I've...
{126617}{126673}- Jeeps with no antitank weapons.|- We'll improvise!
{126675}{126731}We'll fix them up with machine guns,|armor plate...
{126733}{126804}...and there are four antiaircraft guns|nobody knows we have.
{126807}{126837}But how would you use them?
{126841}{126918}We're mounting them on half-tracks|so they can fire straight ahead.
{126920}{126955}In Jerusalem?
{126965}{126997}Jerusalem?
{127001}{127062}The city is almost isolated.|You can't hold it.
{127064}{127100}We should evacuate everyone.
{127102}{127172}It'll cost us 10 times as much|to hold the city as it's worth.
{127173}{127224}How much is Jerusalem worth, Asher?
{127249}{127301}What did it close at on Wall street today?
{127303}{127388}What's the market price of a 100-foot|frontage on Solomon's temple?
{127389}{127441}Not much, with the desert full of tanks...
{127444}{127513}...while you waste your arms|defending the impossible.
{127514}{127583}There will be arms for the desert|and arms for Jerusalem!
{127585}{127665}- Lf you believe in miracles.|- You came back, didn't you?
{127705}{127756}You and Stone|take the jeeps into the Negev...
{127758}{127846}...and see what can be done at night|to stop the Egyptian tanks.
{127853}{127945}You and Ram will move your best units|to the road to Jerusalem.
{127946}{128036}Find out what it'll take|to break through to the city.
{128040}{128092}You'll all report|to me on what we have to do...
{128103}{128181}...and Asher will explain to us|why it cannot be done...
{128194}{128232}...and then we will do it.
{128973}{129000}We'll make camp.
{129002}{129087}We'll sleep here during daylight|and move on after dark.
{129096}{129136}David!
{129341}{129373}What's up?
{129385}{129437}They've picked up Egyptian tank radio.
{129439}{129501}They don't know, so they're talking freely.
{129503}{129552}- Well?|- They've moved fast.
{129553}{129629}A column is heading north|to knock out the Har Safid Kibbutz.
{129631}{129677}What do they have at Har Safid?
{129679}{129736}Your old friend Yussuf|with 20 men of the Palmach.
{129737}{129838}- What else?|- Wire, slit trenches, Molotov cocktails...
{129853}{129880}...children.
{129882}{129956}- Radio?|- No communications at all.
{129959}{130048}- They made a hit without warning.|- How long will it take us to reach them?
{130050}{130144}Too long. It'll be broad daylight.|The plan was only for night assault.
{130193}{130240}I'm just an adviser.
{130262}{130286}Then advise.
{130288}{130350}You've got no choice.|Hit those tanks with everything.
{130355}{130432}- Risk the entire force?|- They don't know that. Go for broke.
{130433}{130514}This has gotta be the biggest bluff|since the invention of falsies.
{130516}{130580}If we're wiped out,|they'll be in Tel Aviv by Saturday.
{130582}{130666}If you don't,|they'll be there for Friday supper.
{130672}{130731}This is the only mobile force|in the entire Negev.
{130733}{130800}There's a mountain over there|called "Masada"?
{130802}{130826}Masada.
{130829}{130901}It was the last stronghold|of our revolt against the Romans.
{130903}{130943}I know. And they had an adviser, too.
{130945}{131025}After they held out for three years|he advised them to give up.
{131027}{131132}They didn't have a chance, so 960 of them|committed suicide on top of that mountain.
{131133}{131158}That's right.
{131161}{131212}- And you guys are proud of it?|- Of course!
{131214}{131240}What do you want?
{131243}{131332}An eloquent philosophical speech|and then you all go and cut your throats?
{131336}{131381}David, attack!
{131399}{131452}There have been enough Masadas|in this country.
{131981}{132066}- The whole air force is at Jerusalem.|- All three planes?
{132068}{132133}Yes, all they can spare is one Piper Cub.
{132146}{132191}No pilot, no bomb racks, no bombs.
{132218}{132309}Tell them to drop anything they can find.|Anything that makes a noise.
{132312}{132414}Vince told me of a run he made over|New Guinea with half-empty pop bottles.
{132416}{132441}- What?|- Yeah!
{132443}{132511}They burst on impact.|Make a hell of an explosion.
{132516}{132592}Now, don't tell me|they don't have seltzer in Tel Aviv?
{132841}{132888}- They think we're crazy.|- Good.
{132889}{132947}Right, now we're|going to split into two columns...
{132949}{132995}...and attack from opposite directions.
{132997}{133057}I have orders not to allow you|into combat...
{133074}{133176}...but will you advise one column?
{133196}{133247}I was afraid you weren't going to ask.
{133298}{133328}Mickey.
{133355}{133465}I've never faced tanks before.|Neither have my men.
{133469}{133580}David, that's all right.|The Egyptians have never faced seltzer.
{133605}{133654}You! Change partners!
{133823}{133869}There's a war on! Come on!
{133977}{134016}Come on.
{134081}{134110}What's this for?
{134112}{134179}A trick we learned from the Stukas|in the other war.
{134181}{134242}It's like a whistle.|It screams on the way down.
{134256}{134300}That's great. That'll make two of us.
{134317}{134372}Put that on the seat there, son.
{134475}{134545}Where can I get a bet|down on the other side?
{138965}{139032}Let's run for it.|Get those tanks to chase us.
{139336}{139375}They're coming along.
{142159}{142199}I called you back from the desert...
{142201}{142310}...because things are not going well.
{142344}{142439}The Egyptian tanks have been stopped.|You've got Jaffa, Haifa, Acre.
{142457}{142500}Don't worry. Things aren't so bad.
{142517}{142610}Mickey, there's been a disaster.|Terrible disaster.
{142643}{142719}The Arab Legion has moved|into the fortress of Latrun...
{142721}{142772}...and cut the only supply road|to Jerusalem.
{142775}{142801}The Arab Legion?
{142808}{142896}Our boys tried to break through yesterday|and were slaughtered like cattle.
{142897}{142960}The wheat fields|are irrigated with their blood.
{142964}{143042}That's a real defense minister speech.|Now, what happened?
{143047}{143099}Hardly any artillery, not enough men...
{143101}{143180}...but most important,|no centralized leadership.
{143185}{143264}You're right. We have no high command.|We have a committee.
{143280}{143334}You know about the cease-fire?
{143363}{143435}The United Nations requested|a general truce...
{143437}{143496}...effective the morning of June 11.
{143499}{143529}Did you accept it?
{143569}{143637}We don't want to see any more bloodshed|on either side.
{143666}{143720}I bet the Arabs have accepted.
{143729}{143796}They know you can't break through|to Jerusalem in that time.
{143797}{143857}When the cease-fire comes,|the lines will be frozen.
{143863}{143936}The city will have to surrender|or be starved to death.
{143953}{143978}We have two weeks.
{143989}{144037}- Less.|- But we've been over all this.
{144039}{144104}What the hell's so important|about Jerusalem, militarily?
{144105}{144147}Half the city's already fallen.
{144149}{144244}It doesn't make sense to risk everything|you've got to save the other half.
{144246}{144320}Did it make sense for a fellow|with a job building pyramids...
{144322}{144381}...to march his friends into the Red Sea?
{144401}{144468}Mickey, Jerusalem is starving.
{144483}{144565}Three pieces of bread a week|for the children, almost no water.
{144569}{144622}Jerusalem was destroyed|once by Nebuchadnezzar...
{144624}{144663}...a second time by Titus of Rome.
{144665}{144716}Not again, Mickey. Not again!
{144724}{144784}Without Jerusalem, there is no Israel.
{144879}{144945}The defense minister|has made another speech.
{144995}{145063}I'd be interested in knowing|how you intend to save it.
{145109}{145197}In the Bible is a Hebrew word|I've never seen anywhere else.
{145199}{145239}{Y:i}The word is "Aluf. "
{145249}{145291}It means commander.
{145297}{145348}More than that, it means leader.
{145366}{145465}I'm placing the unified command|of all forces in the Jerusalem front...
{145467}{145521}{Y:i}...in the hands of Aluf Michael Stone.
{145566}{145626}Now, wait a minute!|When I first asked for command...
{145629}{145687}...there was time to organize,|train, and prepare.
{145689}{145752}It's like giving a kid a balloon|when the party's over.
{145753}{145828}- I don't believe in miracles.|- About miracles, I wouldn't know...
{145831}{145925}{Y:i}...but the last Aluf mentioned in the Bible|was Joshua of Jericho.
{145953}{146013}I've written a note|to all brigade commanders...
{146016}{146062}...announcing your appointment.
{146111}{146135}Well?
{146172}{146291}Don't you want to be the first general|of the army of Israel in 2,000 years?
{146429}{146456}{Y:i}Aluf?
{146825}{146871}How long has this convoy|been hung up here?
{146873}{146935}Two days. There is hope?
{146966}{147018}Tell them not to keep their motors running.
{147048}{147076}And I?
{147126}{147169}You never turn yours off.
{147305}{147377}{Y:i}That means, "I love you," Aluf Stone.
{147394}{147456}A general should learn|that much of the language.
{147467}{147528}Nobody's going to love me|when this fighting's over.
{147530}{147572}Nobody who's alive.
{147589}{147627}Then I'll be dead.
{147681}{147790}"Do not die, for I shall hate|All women so, when thou art gone. "
{147797}{147848}What a time to think of that one.
{147853}{147919}The air smells of cow manure and blood.
{148244}{148271}Asher.
{148334}{148384}- Mickey.|- Hello, Ram.
{148405}{148456}I got something from the old man.
{148598}{148655}- It's about time.|- You gave in too easily.
{148657}{148710}You must be in worse|trouble than I thought.
{148712}{148784}We are. We lost 600 men|in the first assault.
{148813}{148882}We are forced to send immigrants|from the detention camps...
{148884}{148936}...directly from the|boats to the front lines.
{148937}{148997}Where do they get their basic training?|On the bus?
{148998}{149027}If they are lucky.
{149038}{149087}Most of the men have given up hope.
{149090}{149176}With the Legion controlling the heights,|I can't blame them.
{149179}{149237}Asher, your mission's to take Latrun.
{149245}{149305}If you can't do it,|I'll get somebody who can.
{149309}{149375}{Y:i}Yes, Aluf Stone.
{149397}{149479}We'll have a staff meeting in half an hour.|I want to clean up.
{149481}{149552}- Where's the Waldorf-Astoria?|- This way.
{149571}{149683}And this is the police fortress of Latrun,|now occupied by the Arab Legion.
{149689}{149740}This is the road to Jerusalem.
{149761}{149801}And here behind these trees,
{149801}{149865}the Legion has installed|its heavy artillery.
{149870}{149966}Is there any way to bypass that road|and get the trucks through to Jerusalem?
{149969}{149992}No.
{150000}{150069}Nothing that is not|in full view of those big guns there.
{150080}{150134}The only way is here,|through the Bab El Wad.
{150144}{150208}That's where we were ambushed|in the convoy last month.
{150209}{150298}The rest is high cliffs,|wild terrain, impossible to pass.
{150305}{150412}Our plan is for an armored attack|against the fort from this direction...
{150413}{150475}...a frontal assault|through the wheat field here...
{150477}{150544}...and a raid to knock out|their gun emplacements here.
{150545}{150605}- Tonight?|- Not a chance.
{150608}{150636}Tomorrow?
{150647}{150723}- Maybe.|- You can lose a war on "maybe. "
{150737}{150808}All right, we could try.|But the plan itself?
{150831}{150867}Very professional.
{150881}{150967}- You'd all get an "A" At West Point.|- Thank you.
{150983}{151023}I've just one suggestion:
{151036}{151110}I'd like an infantry unit|to outflank the entire position...
{151112}{151168}...then smash through this village|behind the fort.
{151171}{151235}They'd find themselves|threatened with being cut off...
{151237}{151276}...and they'd be forced to withdraw.
{151277}{151305}Maybe.
{151322}{151346}What do you mean?
{151348}{151433}You're speaking of coordinating|four different actions simultaneously.
{151436}{151508}You're not just playing in a sandbox.|This is for keeps.
{151510}{151609}The only chance against that firepower|is to complete the action before daylight.
{151611}{151652}- The whole action?|- What do you think?
{151655}{151694}It'll take split-second timing.
{151696}{151764}You might as well all start|getting used to it right now.
{151766}{151808}Synchronize to mine.
{151831}{151928}When I say "hack,"|It'll be exactly 11:05. Ready?
{151940}{152030}Three, two, one, hack.
{152032}{152061}{Y:i}Aluf Stone...
{152073}{152129}...you'll have to excuse us.|We don't have a watch.
{152868}{152952}The buses were held up by mechanical|difficulties, but now we're ready.
{152955}{152984}So is the Legion.
{152986}{153081}In half an hour,|it'll be light enough to read your obituary.
{153093}{153163}- You've got no choice.|- We must attack.
{153252}{153285}{Y:i}Kadlmal
{153312}{153368}Any word from Petach battalion?
{153375}{153416}We're going to try?
{153422}{153518}Our only chance is if that infantry unit|can outflank the fort.
{153681}{153746}They've almost reached Imwas,|behind the enemy positions.
{153748}{153812}- No one has spotted them yet.|- Good.
{153860}{153888}Thanks.
{153905}{153930}What's this?
{153953}{153977}What?
{153980}{154046}Ram got into a big argument|with some of the men...
{154049}{154096}...who wouldn't believe|he was a commander.
{154097}{154156}So we sent for some ribbon|for all the officers.
{154157}{154248}- What about the general?|- We're out of ribbon.
{154257}{154297}The story of my life.
{154464}{154490}Ram.
{154537}{154624}Wait a minute.|Now that you've got that piece of ribbon...
{154625}{154697}...I should order you|to stay behind with us at headquarters.
{154708}{154757}You never obeyed my orders.
{154779}{154801}Okay.
{155296}{155347}{Y:i}Aluf Stone!
{155358}{155402}{Y:i}Aluf Stone, remember me?
{155415}{155486}- I'm not sure I...|- The bus from Lydda airport.
{155499}{155535}I told you to go to hell.
{155589}{155620}Now I remember.
{155630}{155672}I'm glad you didn't.
{156251}{156293}Where do they come from?
{156332}{156412}Belsen, Auschwitz, Buchenwald...
{156433}{156471}...by way of Cyprus.
{156689}{156728}What are they singing?
{156731}{156826}The same song they used to sing|on the way to the gas chambers.
{156893}{156940}And as most of our songs...
{156943}{157013}...it begins, "Next year in Jerusalem. "
{157099}{157145}"Next year in Jerusalem. "
{158368}{158416}Gafna Blue, this is Petach Red.
{158418}{158452}Do you read me? Over.
{158490}{158541}- Where are you?|- Did they contact the Legion?
{158543}{158617}{Y:i}-We're In the wheat fleld.|- Did you make contact with the Legion?
{158620}{158683}{Y:i}The Leglon Is on the roof of the fort.|We can see them.
{162065}{162108}Our flamethrowers are a surprise.
{162124}{162203}{Y:i}-They made them for us, and they work.|- How about the dynamite?
{162234}{162281}Our boys are placing the dynamite.
{162958}{163011}We're inside. Inside the wall!
{163018}{163056}Three of us. No, four!
{163062}{163116}{Y:i}-Four carsl|- They've made it!
{163381}{163448}Excuse the expression,|but where the hell is the Palmach?
{163469}{163531}The infantry were supposed|to be attacking the rear.
{163533}{163569}Do they want us to be fried?
{163581}{163689}{Y:i}Magda, do you read me?|Gafna Blue, thls Is Petach Red.
{163773}{163796}What'd she say?
{163798}{163895}The second hit a minefield|and the artillery has found the range.
{163897}{163965}Where's the infantry battalion?|Everything depends on them.
{163967}{164040}They should've captured the town|and be coming from the rear.
{164164}{164259}- They've decided to withdraw.|- What? Withdraw? How the hell...
{164270}{164349}All right. What went wrong?|How many casualties?
{164354}{164384}Two. Two dead.
{164390}{164444}- Two?|- Try to understand.
{164445}{164488}They're all from the same neighborhood.
{164489}{164540}18 families lost sons in the last attack.
{164542}{164608}And now two more.|Two from a family that already lost two.
{164610}{164640}They're withdrawing.
{164645}{164675}That does it.
{164821}{164861}Our car has been set on fire.
{164863}{164919}We need mortars! Mortars!
{164943}{165008}We need more than mortars.|We need God.
{165015}{165053}Do you read me, God?
{165101}{165128}This is Rona.
{165185}{165209}Rona.
{165226}{165268}Do you hear me, Rona?
{165278}{165307}Rona!
{165417}{165468}They don't need generals now.
{166059}{166084}Ram!
{166097}{166128}Ram!
{166242}{166273}I'm sorry.
{166381}{166444}The 7th Brigade lost 200 men.
{166491}{166557}The 3rd, over 300.
{166785}{166838}The immigrants were hit the hardest.
{166845}{166954}We gave orders in seven languages,|and still many couldn't understand.
{166956}{166996}But they advanced.
{166998}{167106}We found their bodies in the wheat,|safety catches still on their guns.
{167142}{167191}They didn't even know|how to release them.
{167193}{167288}- But they still advanced.|- But they were all facing toward Latrun.
{167292}{167324}"Next year in Jerusalem. "
{167328}{167370}What do you want me to do, cry?
{167372}{167437}It means your training is poor|and you need interpreters.
{167440}{167537}It means you're wasting manpower.|These kids want to fight.
{167540}{167612}You know how important that is?|We've got to attack again.
{167615}{167687}They wanted to fight.|It's a little different now.
{167689}{167724}The Arab Legion won't move out.
{167724}{167776}They're just playing|for time till the truce.
{167778}{167854}Now you've got to regroup,|reorganize and attack.
{167909}{167953}I must think of my men.
{167963}{168033}You saw yourself, our boys are worn out.
{168034}{168088}We're all worn out, but we'll do it.
{168124}{168189}We made it across the Red Sea, didn't we?
{168283}{168351}It's the first time|I ever heard you say "we. "
{168493}{168519}Yeah.
{168595}{168628}You people...
{168648}{168690}Pipsqueak nation...
{168723}{168806}Tin-can army|that fights with seltzer bottles.
{168823}{168851}"We. "
{168890}{168981}All my life,|I've been looking for where I belong.
{168991}{169031}Turns out it's here.
{169109}{169168}The Catskill Mountains with Arabs.
{169245}{169298}I've been so angry at the world...
{169311}{169371}...ever since I was circumcised|without my permission.
{169385}{169474}All of a sudden,|I find out I'm not so special after all.
{169492}{169592}Everybody here is in the same boat|and nobody's bellyaching.
{169612}{169638}Okay.
{169655}{169703}"Stand up and be counted," the man said.
{169729}{169779}"Grow up," is more like it.
{169817}{169911}I'm not fighting anymore|because I'm ashamed of being a Jew.
{169926}{170016}I'm fighting because I'm stiff-necked|and proud of it.
{170028}{170113}Next week, Asher.|Next week in Jerusalem.
{170122}{170154}{Y:i}Aluf Stone.
{170168}{170227}{Y:i}Aluf Stone, an old friend wants to see you.
{170296}{170330}{Y:i}Salaam alelkum.
{170338}{170400}{Y:i}-Shalom.|- I bring a gift.
{170442}{170476}What's this?
{170481}{170505}Camels.
{170517}{170593}We have been told of your road|on which your trucks cannot move.
{170604}{170639}Thank you for your generous gift.
{170642}{170748}We appreciate what you're doing for us|but let me try to show you the problem.
{170749}{170842}You see, the heavy artillery on that hill|commands this entire valley.
{170844}{170904}There is no way around|for trucks or camels.
{170906}{170999}Don't worry, I did not steal|the finest camels in the entire desert...
{171001}{171055}...to have them butchered by Abdullah...
{171057}{171128}Yes, but perhaps you're not familiar|with the land here and...
{171129}{171165}I am not familiar?
{171167}{171268}I was having women in these hills|when your father was sucking milk...
{171270}{171321}...and your mother was...|- Take a look at this.
{171324}{171343}What is this?
{171343}{171402}- This is what we call|a relief map of Latrun.
{171408}{171470}- Latrun?|- That's the fort. This is a road...
{171473}{171510}Latrun...
{171513}{171540}...Hulda.|- That's right.
{171542}{171572}Beit Jiz.
{171581}{171622}- Bab El Wad.|- Abu Ghosh.
{171624}{171664}- Jerusalem.|- Exactly.
{171682}{171748}- What child did this?|- What do you mean?
{171749}{171804}- This hill doesn't exist.|- No, let him.
{171806}{171856}This hill is over here.
{171885}{171957}{Y:i}And there is an old wadl through here...
{171973}{172014}...that cannot be seen from Latrun.
{172021}{172052}Asher, listen to this:
{172053}{172108}Since you have taken|the village of Beit Jiz...
{172117}{172173}...my camels can move through here.
{172175}{172236}There's another way|through these hills to Jerusalem.
{172239}{172305}{Y:i}The Palmach boys|have already found this wadl.
{172326}{172384}It's barely wide enough for a jeep...
{172398}{172457}...and it ends against|the bottom of a cliff.
{172497}{172545}And they'll come out here.
{172554}{172599}The other side of Bab El Wad.
{172601}{172667}Fifty camels couldn't move|enough supplies in a week...
{172669}{172711}...to feed Jerusalem for half a day.
{172716}{172744}Who is this idiot?
{172746}{172814}{Y:i}Are you sure the wadl's big enough|to build a road?
{172817}{172874}- To take those heavy trucks to Jerusalem?|- Yes.
{172876}{172919}Build the road in a week?
{172921}{173003}The cliffs in that area|are over 250 feet high.
{173007}{173091}{Y:i}Allah Azlml|If one of my men spoke to me in this way...
{173093}{173143}...I would draw my knife|and make him a eunuch.
{173145}{173181}{Y:i}Let's see this wadl of yours.
{173185}{173251}But perhaps in his case,|it has already been done.
{173253}{173302}We can at least take a look.
{173470}{173502}Stop!
{173525}{173553}You see?
{173557}{173676}The Jerusalem road is only 1,000 meters|the other side of this little bump.
{173829}{173862}All right, let's get closer.
{174071}{174104}Let's push.
{174223}{174261}Okay, all together.
{174277}{174328}Don't be daft. You're wasting your time.
{174333}{174429}Even if you could blast a road for trucks,|you'd never make it up this.
{174431}{174527}You'd have to build a mile of switchback|and take over that next hill there.
{174529}{174576}- It would take a year.|- Who the hell are you?
{174578}{174602}Capt. MacAfee.
{174604}{174692}He came to us by way of the Scots Guards,|but he's our best engineer.
{174694}{174738}Hopefully, one of your worst prophets.
{174743}{174789}Mr. MacAfee, during the 14th century...
{174791}{174870}...Spanish troops carved|200 steps up a cliff in a single night.
{174883}{174946}Aye, but we don't have any trucks|that can climb steps.
{174948}{175004}- Boys, move right back there.|- Lf one of my men...
{175006}{175107}Don't tempt me. Mr. MacAfee,|will you come this way, please?
{175257}{175334}There's going to be a road|up this little bump, see?
{175337}{175381}Now, I'll start the job.
{175409}{175453}You figure out a way to finish it...
{175456}{175541}...or one of these rocks will have|your name on it and tomorrow's date.
{175544}{175642}To use the colorful local vernacular,|what kind of a schnook do you think I am?
{175644}{175727}Who's going to build a road|up these cliffs in a week?
{175755}{175812}The schnooks, Capt. MacAfee.
{175850}{175891}The army of the schnooks.
{176657}{176715}If the Arab Legion finds out|what's going on here...
{176717}{176795}...they'll turn those guns around|and blast the hell out of them.
{176817}{176850}Do they know that?
{176856}{176886}They know.
{176933}{176971}Why do they come?
{177025}{177077}I'm still trying to figure out why you came.
{177576}{177660}Okay, keep working, boys.|Get your backs into it.
{177662}{177734}That's the stuff. Keep going, lads.
{177758}{177867}Mac, you've got to get going on that road.|You can't feed Jerusalem on piggyback.
{177869}{177916}It's a very big bump.
{178044}{178117}But they're starving to death|on the other side of it.
{178218}{178273}Put out that light, somebody! Kill it!
{178685}{178732}They're moving up hill 49...
{178745}{178786}...half a mile from our road.
{178798}{178860}{Y:i}It's the flrst tlme|they've sent out patrols at nlght.
{179591}{179631}The Legion is pulling back.
{179633}{179706}Let's hope they stay back. Four days.
{179708}{179760}Then the UN freezes the lines.
{179764}{179822}We'll have to risk working days|as well as nights.
{180038}{180075}From your wife?
{180093}{180136}I know the handwriting.
{180143}{180196}My heart freezes when I see it.
{180206}{180294}Emma's seen the newspaper stories|about the fighting.
{180298}{180364}She doesn't know where I am|or what I'm doing, but...
{180368}{180446}...she doesn't want me|to have any more problems, so...
{180547}{180594}...she'll give me a divorce.
{180873}{180948}If you've forgotten,|that means "I love you. "
{181029}{181097}{Y:i}Don't hate me for lovlng you so much.
{181117}{181180}{Y:i}Don't hate me for lovlng you so much.
{181989}{182018}Welcome.
{182085}{182132}Sorry I'm late, gentlemen.
{182146}{182207}- How do you like our Burma road?|- What road?
{182209}{182303}- How many trucks did you get up this cliff?|- I don't know the exact number...
{182305}{182336}Under their own power?
{182337}{182377}- What?|- You heard me.
{182401}{182460}You certainly get good information.
{182471}{182558}Yes, we've been hauling them,|but last night we finished the last stretch.
{182565}{182620}I could drive it myself now. It's a cinch.
{182628}{182685}Then would you explain that to us?
{182785}{182833}I don't like to be skeptic, Col. Stone.
{182841}{182913}The United Nations has a delicate|and difficult task here...
{182915}{182976}...if it is to retain international respect.
{182978}{183081}If that road is passable to heavy traffic,|the siege of Jerusalem is broken.
{183083}{183107}That's right.
{183109}{183149}The question is, is it passable?
{183181}{183239}Of course it is. Excuse me. Mr. MacAfee!
{183323}{183374}They still can't climb steps.
{183377}{183471}None of the drivers are happy about|taking another crack at it, not after that.
{183473}{183498}They won't budge.
{183501}{183588}- How long to get that truck on the road?|- An hour, maybe two.
{183613}{183666}Get that bulldozer and|shove it off the cliff.
{183668}{183712}- But look...|- Shove it off!
{183749}{183843}Okay! Get that bulldozer up behind|the lorry and shove it right over!
{183848}{183880}Right over!
{184645}{184711}All right, let's get that jeep back.
{184724}{184773}Come on, let's get the show on the road.
{184775}{184817}Right, back you go.
{184819}{184843}That's fine.
{184849}{184904}Come on, move up in the back there!|Okay, move!
{184914}{184977}Right up here! Come on, go!
{184994}{185031}What's he playing at?
{185033}{185089}There's nothing to it.|It's just a Sunday drive.
{185194}{185226}Jerusalem.
{185248}{185326}All right, you understand.|We have no choice. Come on.
{185419}{185462}Don't hurt my highway.
{186181}{186228}You've got plenty of room.
{187190}{187215}See?
{187226}{187273}As long as we don't run into any traffic.
{188950}{189008}Do you think I learned Hebrew|since yesterday?
{189032}{189091}Is that the language|you use here in a monastery?
{189096}{189152}{Y:i}I'm sorry, Aluf Stone.|I didn't recognize you.
{189165}{189190}I guess it's foolish.
{189193}{189254}After all, only a couple of hours|till the cease-fire.
{189259}{189291}Stay alert.
{189293}{189359}The Arabs might still use it|as a trick to launch an attack.
{189381}{189414}Let 'em try.
{189425}{189479}- What's your name?|- Chaim.
{189512}{189552}Tell your friends it's official now.
{189553}{189608}We're marching into Jerusalem|in the morning.
{189610}{189673}Through the back door, sure,|but we made it.
{189675}{189762}And when anyone asks you how we did it,|tell them you did it.
{189764}{189850}- That's an order from your commander.|- Okay, Mickey.
{189873}{189964}You're an insubordinate SOB.|You'll go far, Chaim.
{190137}{190195}- Chaim.|- Tov.
{190811}{190888}If you knew the trouble I had|to get by the sentries...
{190890}{190973}Such an army we have now!|So West Point!
{191064}{191105}Something is wrong.
{191165}{191193}Magda...
{191273}{191315}...I've fallen in love.
{191344}{191383}Your wife, I know.
{191430}{191479}What has that to do with us?
{191485}{191559}- You're being very European.|- I am very European.
{191569}{191654}I live with what is,|not what I would like it to be.
{191656}{191699}I can't live that way.
{191711}{191744}Not anymore.
{191755}{191819}See, when Emma said I could go...
{191841}{191907}...I knew it was time|to stop running after everything.
{191918}{191948}Excitement, war...
{191949}{191992}I don't want to listen.
{191993}{192068}I know everything before you say it.|I've heard it before.
{192229}{192274}Did you know that...
{192300}{192344}You never said it to me.
{192345}{192368}Now.
{192374}{192475}I'm saying it now, because we're here|at the monastery of Abu Ghosh...
{192486}{192533}...on the road to Jerusalem.
{192545}{192604}You're standing beneath a rosebush|in the moonlight.
{192646}{192711}But how would you look|in Brooklyn plucking a chicken?
{192729}{192755}What?
{192796}{192870}I'm going home, Magda, for good.
{192881}{192916}For damn good.
{192956}{193059}I guess I've been in love with Emma|all my life, and I wouldn't admit it.
{193152}{193226}Now I'm picking a rose for her.
{193277}{193337}I'll take it to her|as if I were the schnook lawyer...
{193339}{193387}...she always wanted me to be.
{193413}{193446}Run, Magda.
{193463}{193556}Run for your life.|The schnooks are taking over the world.
{193569}{193606}{Y:i}Shalom, Mickey.
{193730}{193755}You bastard.
{194567}{194632}Chaim, I don't know|what you think I was doing there...
{194633}{194676}...but I wasn't learning Hebrew.
{194729}{194772}I don't want to fight anymore.
{194773}{194832}I wanna go to bed,|and then I'm going home.
{196669}{196778}{Y:i}Mrs. Davld Marcus, 482 Westmlnster Road|Brooklyn, New York.
{196796}{196849}{Y:i}Your husband fell last nlght at hls post...
{196851}{196955}{Y:i}...In the hllls of Jerusalem,|the last casualty before the truce.
{196977}{197049}{Y:i}Durlng the too-short tlme|of hls belng wlth us...
{197051}{197137}{Y:i}...as a man, and as a commander,|he endeared hlmself...
{197140}{197211}{Y:i}...to all who came Into personal contact|wlth hlm.
{197230}{197313}{Y:i}Hls name wlll Ilve forever|In the annals of our people.
{3592}{3638}The island of Cyprus, madam.
{3641}{3726}World famous for beauty|and long, tragic history.
{3729}{3769}Been conquered many times.
{3771}{3878}Conquered by Phoenicians, Assyrians,|Persians, Macedonians.
{3892}{4003}Also conquered by Greeks, Romans,|Byzantines, Turks.
{4022}{4120}Purchased from Turkey|by your esteemed self, the British Empire.
{4132}{4191}All Cyprus most fond of the British.
{4246}{4281}I'm an American.
{4290}{4374}Fond of Americans also.|We Cypriots are fond of everybody.
{4377}{4434}Shall we go through the castle now?
{4437}{4491}No, I've changed my mind.
{4499}{4573}Then maybe the Tower of Othello|at the harbor of Famagusta.
{4575}{4637}-It's included in the tour.|-All right.
{6399}{6441}What's the matter here?
{6444}{6527}Prison ship has arrived|full of Jews for the camps, madam.
{6530}{6614}-What camps?|-Detention camps out at Karaolos.
{6617}{6713}You see, the Jews, they charter a ship|from Europe to get to Palestine.
{6716}{6793}Then the British catch the ship|and send the whole bunch here.
{6795}{6898}The Arabs don't want them in Palestine.|The British don't want them here, either.
{6901}{6949}-But they got them.|-Stop!
{7258}{7289}Get him!
{7401}{7478}Maybe you can back up|and drive me to this address.
{7515}{7570}House of the British Commander.
{8970}{9013}Now, then.
{9029}{9071}-Get his feet.|-Right.
{9113}{9138}Up.
{9698}{9732}Mrs. Fremont?
{9776}{9843}The General's expecting you in the garden.
{10062}{10119}How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?
{10139}{10190}I'm very glad to see you.
{10193}{10231}Please sit down.
{10266}{10315}Found that here in the garden.
{10318}{10401}From the color,|I'd say it belongs to the Byzantine period.
{10404}{10476}The Byzantines occupied|Cyprus for centuries.
{10483}{10591}Gives one an idea how temporary|our claims to the world's real estate are.
{10605}{10689}I'm ashamed to say I really don't know|anything about archeology.
{10692}{10721}Few people do.
{10723}{10803}Didn't you once publish something|about the Roman ruins in Cheltenham?
{10806}{10873}A very obscure something. How did you know?
{10882}{10973}Tom mentioned it in one of his letters.|He was very proud of your friendship.
{10976}{11017}As I was of his.
{11035}{11114}Will you have tea, or something livelier?
{11129}{11178}Something livelier, please.
{11226}{11283}-Is that ice I see?|-Surprised?
{11312}{11361}Tom got me into the habit.
{11391}{11471}Now I use ice in practically everything.
{11516}{11551}There we are.
{11639}{11693}May we drink to Tom?
{11716}{11748}Of course.
{11828}{11934}I'm extremely sorry circumstances|compelled us to bury him in the field.
{11946}{12018}Even sorrier I was|transferred from Palestine...
{12021}{12067}...before I got the chance to see you.
{12082}{12180}It wasn't your fault.|It took me almost a week to arrange passage.
{12192}{12259}But your letter was waiting there for me,|and Tom's things.
{12265}{12330}I really shouldn't have let him go with us.
{12333}{12373}It was only a border affair.
{12376}{12451}One of the Jewish undergrounds|had blown up half a dozen bridges.
{12454}{12541}It really wasn't important enough|to lose one's life for.
{12550}{12584}Is anything?
{12594}{12643}In my opinion, yes.
{12662}{12757}I've known many soldiers, Mrs. Fremont,|and war correspondents...
{12759}{12821}...and news photographers,|such as your husband.
{12824}{12901}But I think perhaps Tom|was the bravest man I've ever met.
{12927}{12979}We have a saying in Indiana:
{12984}{13051}"The braver the bird, the fatter the cat."
{13063}{13093}Perhaps.
{13128}{13193}Do you recognize this photograph, General?
{13195}{13242}Of course. It was his last.
{13245}{13290}Do you remember how Tom got that shot?
{13292}{13317}We were together.
{13319}{13404}I must confess, my eyes weren't on him|when he snapped the shutter.
{13406}{13478}The aircraft came in low.|We were both in the truck.
{13480}{13593}I jumped down on one side to take cover,|and Tom jumped down on the other side.
{13606}{13699}Tom couldn't have taken cover|and photographed the plane as he did.
{13702}{13784}I dare say you're right.|He had a strong sense of duty.
{13805}{13865}He also had a strong sense of death.
{13880}{13977}I felt I had to confirm what I suspected|about the last photograph.
{13990}{14034}I'm very grateful to you.
{14037}{14133}That's over a year ago.|How have you been occupying yourself?
{14140}{14208}-After I lost the child I was-|-The child?
{14246}{14317}Didn't Tom tell you we|had a child on the way?
{14325}{14444}Men like Tom are often quite reticent about|things that are nearest to their hearts.
{14463}{14497}I understand.
{14518}{14589}It was quite late in my pregnancy|when Tom was killed.
{14592}{14657}Apparently the Palestine trip was too much.
{14659}{14730}I lost the baby in the|hospital at Jerusalem.
{14766}{14840}And then I went back|to my old profession of nursing.
{14842}{14937}I've just completed my tour of duty|with the US Public Health Service in Greece.
{14939}{15010}Very good. What are your|plans for the future?
{15032}{15135}I haven't quite decided yet.|I may travel a while before I go home.
{15161}{15254}I have passage booked on a freighter|that sails next week to Istanbul.
{15256}{15311}From there I may go to India.
{15333}{15389}I've always wanted to|see the Vale of Kashmir.
{15391}{15460}It's probably the most|beautiful spot on earth.
{15462}{15521}Mrs. Fremont, may I introduce Maj. Caldwell?
{15523}{15561}-How do you do?|-How do you do?
{15563}{15610}-Have a drink.|-Thank you. I'd love one.
{15613}{15694}-How did your disembarkation go?|-Smoothly.
{15703}{15754}We're really up to our neck in Jews, sir.
{15757}{15830}Karaolos bursting at the seams|and more to come.
{15836}{15916}I still say we should send them back|where they came from.
{15918}{15982}Two loads were shipped out of Haifa|bound for Hamburg.
{15985}{16032}I don't see why we can't do the same thing.
{16035}{16110}I shouldn't like to have a hand|in sending a Jew back to Germany.
{16113}{16157}Squeeze them in as best as you can.
{16160}{16228}They're squeezed in.|Short of bed space, supplies...
{16230}{16304}...short of nurses, short of temper,|short of everything.
{16306}{16350}Mrs. Fremont's a nurse.
{16357}{16418}Why don't you lend a hand at Karaolos?
{16435}{16497}No, General. I'm afraid I couldn't.
{16519}{16578}I've really been quite tired lately.
{16596}{16642}And I don't know anything about them.
{16645}{16678}About the Jews?
{16680}{16717}I feel strange among them.
{16720}{16754}In what way?
{16781}{16839}Now that you mention it, I can't think.
{16842}{16889}It's just a feeling I get.
{16902}{16986}-Will you have another drink?|-Thank you, no. I really must leave.
{16989}{17060}I'm touring the island|and my guide is very firm with me.
{17062}{17143}-I'll take you to your car.|-Thank you for the drink and the talk.
{17146}{17196}Drive by Karaolos on your tour.
{17198}{17285}Ring me if there's anything I can do|to make your stay more comfortable.
{17288}{17317}I will.
{17600}{17673}I'm very fond of the|old man. One of the best.
{17675}{17768}Makes it all the more difficult|to explain his little quirk.
{17770}{17796}Quirk?
{17798}{17873}About the Jews.|You caught it all right. I was watching.
{17906}{17973}Almost makes one believe the story|one hears now and then.
{17976}{18017}Probably nonsense, but still...
{18019}{18045}What story?
{18056}{18159}That if you gave a good shake to his|family tree, you'd find a Jew up there.
{18351}{18417}Please tell Gen. Sutherland|I've changed my mind.
{18420}{18489}I'll be happy to work at|Karaolos for a few days.
{18491}{18537}-Goodbye, Major.|-Goodbye.
{20325}{20382}-Do you need any help?|-No, thanks.
{20392}{20474}-Good night, then.|-Good night, and thanks for stopping.
{21015}{21065}Ari! Ari Ben Canaan!
{21067}{21121}-Reuben. How are you?|-Fine.
{21162}{21200}The car's up there.
{21208}{21264}Good. We'll go directly to Mandria.
{21266}{21344}We can't, Ari.|He's on the other side of the island.
{21346}{21450}-He won't be back until tomorrow.|-He should be on this side of the island.
{22135}{22198}British checkpoint, Jewish checkpoint.
{22202}{22270}We don't allow our military personnel|in the camp area...
{22273}{22325}...unless something extraordinary occurs.
{22327}{22400}We handle the outside.|The inside's up to them.
{22414}{22501}-Lieutenant, this is Katherine Fremont.|-How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?
{22503}{22577}American. Authority Gen. Sutherland.|Pass her at all times.
{22579}{22631}-Very good, sir.|-Thank you.
{22773}{22851}These Zionist organizations,|or whatever they call them...
{22854}{22946}...send their own people over from Palestine|to administer these camps.
{22949}{23020}Jews seem to respond|better to their own kind.
{23023}{23061}Perhaps we all do.
{23064}{23165}We even give them the privilege|of approving all Gentile personnel.
{23176}{23235}-I hope you don't mind.|-Not at all.
{23391}{23440}-Good morning, Ben Ami.|-Good morning, sir.
{23442}{23513}This is Mrs. Fremont,|an American friend of Gen. Sutherland.
{23515}{23557}-How do you do?|-How do you do?
{23560}{23626}Ben Ami is one of the Palestinians|who run this camp.
{23629}{23745}Mrs. Fremont has a few days to while away|in Cyprus, and being an experienced nurse...
{23747}{23817}...the general thought you may find|her assistance valuable.
{23819}{23893}We find all assistance|of value, Maj. Caldwell.
{23902}{23974}-Would you show him your passport?|-Of course.
{24002}{24082}Any friend of Gen. Sutherland's|is always welcome.
{24085}{24154}Convey my respects to the general,|and thank him for us.
{24156}{24261}Of course. Goodbye. Good luck.
{24263}{24318}-Call us if you need us.|-Thank you.
{24321}{24370}-Would you care to come with me?|-Surely.
{24373}{24444}Yesterday's shipload|will double our hospital capacity.
{24446}{24520}It's very good of you|to help us get organized.
{25805}{25868}-Leave me alone.|-You're burning up with fever.
{25870}{25964}If you don't let us clean out the infection|you'll die, that's all.
{25966}{26067}After coming so far, you'll die|without ever having seen Eretz Israel.
{26070}{26146}I'll see Palestine before|you. Now leave me alone.
{26158}{26204}This woman is trying to help you.
{26206}{26255}-Do as she says.|-Who are you?
{26258}{26314}He's the Palestinian commander, that's who.
{26317}{26376}A Jewish policeman, working for them.
{26379}{26428}I know your kind from Auschwitz.
{26446}{26520}-You can't tell me what to do.|-We'll see.
{26524}{26580}-I'll hold him.|-Just try.
{26607}{26682}Dov! If you don't let|them help you, you'll die.
{26685}{26713}I want to die.
{26716}{26817}You don't know what you're saying.|I'll take them off myself. It won't hurt.
{26851}{26905}Keep away from me, all of you.
{26962}{26994}Excuse me.
{27055}{27123}I think I can talk to|him better if we're alone.
{27126}{27237}We came on the Star of David together,|and I know him. He's just shy.
{27262}{27318}Don't get too close to the glass.
{27532}{27612}Dov Landau, you ought to be|ashamed of yourself. Put that down.
{27614}{27643}I won't.
{27660}{27684}That hurt.
{27686}{27784}Not half as bad as it will hurt.|I'll teach you. I'll beat you all over.
{27790}{27861}Well? Do you let them|take care of you or not?
{27916}{28028}Not them. But if you want|to do it, well, all right.
{28077}{28107}Thank you.
{28166}{28245}And don't you ever spit on me again.|Just remember.
{28357}{28430}-It's all right, I'll do it.|-How did you change his mind?
{28433}{28488}Just patience and kindness.
{28546}{28638}Yetta will show you around.|Don't hesitate to call on me if I can help.
{28641}{28672}Thank you.
{28711}{28767}Now, this is pavilion number two.
{28916}{28948}Excuse me.
{28952}{29007}This boy has a skin|infection called impetigo.
{29010}{29094}-He needs sulfathiazole on those scabs.|-lf the camp has no such drug?
{29097}{29161}Leave him alone.|That will spread it all over his body.
{29163}{29228}-You think so?|-I know it. It's terribly contagious.
{29230}{29303}My dear, it's this way.|If you have no sulfathiazole...
{29306}{29360}...and no ammoniated mercury ointment...
{29362}{29464}...which was the earlier pharmacology,|you soften the scab with soap and water...
{29466}{29546}...and gently remove it like this, you see?
{29554}{29633}Then expose the lesion|for five minutes to the sun.
{29642}{29683}That's also a cure.
{29714}{29771}-You're a doctor.|-By coincidence.
{29788}{29845}It was stupid of me to interfere.
{29847}{29941}I'm a nurse. I'll be working here|for a while. Please forgive me.
{29958}{30016}Dr. Odenheim, it's time for you to rest.
{30018}{30088}You've been up all night.|I know how to do this.
{30090}{30174}-He taught me on the ship.|-Thank you, child of light.
{30200}{30280}I'll find you something to wear|over your dress, a gown or an apron.
{30282}{30315}Thank you.
{30354}{30427}My name is Katherine Fremont. I'm a nurse.
{30466}{30543}-You can call me Kitty.|-My name's Karen Hansen.
{30553}{30581}Hansen?
{30609}{30697}-Then your mother was Jewish?|-Yes, and my father.
{31346}{31375}-Reuben.|-Shalom, Ari.
{31378}{31434}-David, how are you?|-Shalom, Ari.
{31455}{31527}-Mr. Mandria, this is Ari Ben Canaan.|-Welcome.
{31544}{31588}Very pleased to meet you.
{31589}{31633}We've heard good things|about you in Palestine.
{31636}{31697}-Rumors. But I like them.|-So do we.
{31702}{31741}Please sit down.
{31766}{31807}-Cigar?|-No, thanks.
{31825}{31896}Well, David,|how many people have you got by now...
{31898}{31950}...in that barbed wire jungle of yours?
{31953}{31988}Over 30,000.
{31990}{32068}And they're building for 30,000 more|on the other side of the island.
{32070}{32129}How many arrived yesterday|on the Star of David?
{32131}{32166}Six hundred and eleven.
{32168}{32271}We're going to take the same 611 off|the island and land them in Palestine.
{32306}{32374}-Six hundred and eleven?|-He thinks he's Moses.
{32398}{32484}We haven't been able to break more|than 10 or 15 at a time out of Karaolos.
{32486}{32566}This will be a new experience.|One thing more. There's a time limit.
{32569}{32643}Today is Tuesday.|We'll stage the break next Monday.
{32646}{32705}-Next Monday?|-Why not tomorrow?
{32720}{32756}Ari, we cannot do it.
{32758}{32822}The United Nations|will vote on the Palestine issue...
{32825}{32860}...before the end of this session.
{32862}{32927}Between now and then|we have to show the world...
{32930}{32979}...thousands of homeless European Jews...
{32982}{33061}...are not going to accept any solution|that bars them from Palestine.
{33063}{33161}A mass escape of the very same people|who arrived on the Star of David...
{33164}{33213}...is worth more than a million speeches.
{33215}{33282}But this isn't the Red Sea, Ari.|It's the Mediterranean.
{33285}{33370}Right. Smite these waters as you will,|they do not part.
{33373}{33436}That's why you'll have to get us a ship.
{33438}{33476}I want a legitimate freighter...
{33478}{33555}...with legal registry and real cargo|we can unload here in Cyprus.
{33558}{33597}A ship for six...
{33669}{33713}That's a wonderful idea.
{33765}{33797}Brilliant.
{33837}{33901}But the expense will be brilliant also.
{33904}{33929}Not too brilliant.
{33932}{33982}You know, our treasury|is based on donations,
{33983}{34033}and right now we're rather low.
{34074}{34187}-Well, can you deliver or not?|-I'll do my best.
{34190}{34299}We Cypriots are with you.|For the Jews, Mandria will do everything.
{34310}{34388}The Jews have paid you well|for your efforts, Mr. Mandria.
{34392}{34482}-Ari, you've got to understand-|-No, Reuben. I say it.
{34542}{34633}Do you believe that l, Plato Mandria,|would do this for money?
{34669}{34739}Do you think I'd risk|10 years in prison for money?
{34742}{34850}I tell you, it has cost me over £5,000|since I work with the Haganah.
{34861}{34910}You owe him an apology, Ari.
{34960}{35032}I do apologize, Mr. Mandria.|It was a stupid remark.
{35034}{35061}Not necessary.
{35064}{35170}If I apologize each time I get stupid,|I'd spend a lifetime on my knees.
{35180}{35272}-Also, we'll need 14 lorries.|-14, he says. Why not 1,400?
{35282}{35369}The British have requisitioned every car,|truck and lorry on this island.
{35372}{35412}Haganah makes mistakes|just like anybody else.
{35413}{35451}This is one of them.
{35454}{35509}David, I want to hear every objection,
{35510}{35566}every criticism, every|suggestion, but only once.
{35599}{35673}-Now the boat project is under way, right?|-Almost accomplished.
{35676}{35737}I will send a telegram|to a shipbroker in Athens.
{35739}{35802}-Don't the British monitor telegrams?|-Naturally.
{35805}{35857}But some of the monitors are Cypriots.
{35859}{35930}They'd like the Britons in Britain,|the Jews in Palestine...
{35932}{36028}...and the Cypriots in Cyprus.|Not, mind you, that I'm anti-British.
{36030}{36093}If I must have a master,|the British are far the best.
{36096}{36181}But the problem, my dear friend, is,|why have a master at all?
{36317}{36391}Shouldn't have hurt him,|Ari. He's a real friend.
{36421}{36474}Maybe, but don't let the Mandrias fool you.
{36477}{36538}They work for us and say|how terrible it was...
{36541}{36593}...that 6,000,000 Jews went into the oven.
{36595}{36657}But when the showdown comes,|we always stand alone.
{36660}{36709}Mandria will sell us|out like all the others.
{36711}{36790}We have no friends, except ourselves.|Remember that.
{36793}{36859}You're wrong,|but you'll have to learn that for yourself.
{36862}{36912}Now tell me, how is Jordana?
{36927}{36971}I think she's in love.
{36995}{37050}You've had this letter|since last night-
{37053}{37085}I forgot about it.
{37088}{37146}He's in love with her,|so he thinks everyone is.
{37148}{37181}He's right.
{37228}{37273}She mention me in there?
{37389}{37421}Thank you.
{37525}{37573}-No, thank you.|-None for me.
{37600}{37660}How did you know I postponed my departure?
{37662}{37758}Central Intelligence has a great talent|for spying on the innocent.
{37761}{37830}It'll interest them to learn|that I have a plot under way.
{37833}{37890}Good. Can you tell me about it?
{37905}{37974}There's a child at the camp|I'd like to take out for a holiday.
{37977}{38047}Just for luncheon,|and perhaps to buy her some clothes.
{38050}{38129}Then I take it|some of the strangeness has worn off?
{38157}{38206}I know it was foolish to say that.
{38209}{38287}But I can't help it. I do|feel strange among them.
{38298}{38398}Except for this girl.|Somehow she's entirely different.
{38401}{38465}Her point of view, the way she works...
{38470}{38548}...she acts, feels and speaks|almost exactly like an American.
{38550}{38605}I can think of no higher praise.
{38642}{38688}You're laughing at me, and I deserve it.
{38690}{38764}I'm not laughing. I'm simply glad it worked.
{38767}{38817}-What?|-I wanted you to get interested...
{38820}{38901}...in something|beside your own troubles, and you did.
{38914}{38976}It's interesting that you saw it so fast.
{38986}{39077}-Of course, you were absolutely right.|-I'm glad you weren't offended.
{39080}{39126}I shouldn't like you to become a woman...
{39129}{39194}...who drifts through|life, "fair to no purpose...
{39197}{39314}"...artful to no end,|young without lovers, old without a friend."
{39344}{39385}Do you have a solution?
{39402}{39488}If I were 20 years younger|I'd offer myself as a solution.
{39490}{39570}The Vale of Kashmir is no good|unless you share it with someone.
{39573}{39653}Places don't mean anything.|Only people are important.
{39655}{39710}Fill your life with people.
{39711}{39766}Let Tom return to the|grave where he belongs.
{39804}{39829}Fred!
{39856}{39915}-Yes, sir?|-There's a child out at Karaolos...
{39918}{39982}...Mrs. Fremont would|like released for a day.
{39985}{40022}What's her name?
{40037}{40063}Karen Hansen.
{40066}{40133}-See to it for me, will you?|-Very well, sir.
{40164}{40230}-Isn't it a little irregular?|-Extremely.
{40233}{40325}That's why I want your signature on the pass|instead of my own.
{40333}{40362}Yes, sir.
{40393}{40423}Thank you.
{41095}{41137}Isn't she a beauty?
{41156}{41201}You must have towed it across.
{41204}{41281}All right, she's no beauty,|but her heart is solid oak. You'll see.
{41283}{41308}Ari!
{41315}{41381}Hank, how are you?|Hank Schlosberg from Cincinnati.
{41384}{41444}He's run more ships through the blockade|than anyone.
{41447}{41518}This is Mr. Mandria, who|arranged for this tub.
{41520}{41590}-Not a bad ship.|-Not a good one, Mr. Mandria.
{41593}{41666}For the money we pay,|every ship cannot be the Queen Mary.
{41669}{41711}Can this abortion make it to Palestine?
{41714}{41777}On my mother's honor,|she has made 300 trips...
{41780}{41836}...from Cyprus to Turkey|under her last owner.
{41838}{41940}That's just the trouble.|We can hold her together for one more round.
{41946}{41989}I want a loudspeaker system aboard.
{41991}{42063}Get me a power unit|and six Almec-Thorston speakers.
{42066}{42120}There is no such equipment|for sale in Cyprus.
{42122}{42213}If you can't buy it, steal it.|Stock it with provisions for five days.
{42216}{42257}-For a two-day trip?|-Five days.
{42260}{42318}All prepared foods,|either canned or packaged.
{42321}{42361}The most expensive, naturally.
{42364}{42449}-Have you got my jeep yet?|-I told you, it's impossible.
{42451}{42518}A jeep is out of the question, absolutely.
{42526}{42632}-Need someone to overhaul the engine tank?|-No, my gang can take care of that.
{42635}{42674}-Mr. Mandria?|-Yes?
{42714}{42764}What about that jeep there?
{42772}{42844}That belongs to His Beatitude...
{42846}{42909}...the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Cyprus.
{42968}{43050}Steal it. Paint it. Hide|it till I'm ready for it.
{43410}{43502}The water's wonderful.|May I have another swim before my steak?
{43505}{43576}Just once more,|because we're due back at the camp.
{43579}{43642}-Is that the girl?|-Yes.
{43673}{43723}Swims just like an American.
{43762}{43808}-I'll buy you a drink if|you'll forget that joke.
{43809}{43853}I just had one.
{43855}{43888}She is nice.
{43930}{44022}Would it be too difficult to arrange|for me to take her back to America?
{44025}{44093}Not from our end.|We'd be glad to let them all go.
{44096}{44152}So long as they don't end up in Palestine.
{44154}{44205}Let me know when you've decided.
{44206}{44257}I'll get Maj. Caldwell|to arrange it for you.
{44261}{44292}Thank you.
{44362}{44389}Karen.
{44427}{44457}Coming.
{44721}{44795}Would you like to go to America?
{44806}{44884}Of course. Everybody likes to go to America.
{44908}{44946}Then you will go.
{44953}{45029}I'll cancel the rest of my trip,|and I'll take you with me.
{45031}{45105}And you can go to school there,|and later on to the university.
{45107}{45205}And if you like it, and want to,|you can become an American citizen.
{45207}{45254}You mean, go right away?
{45263}{45317}Perhaps. In the next week or two.
{45319}{45381}Meanwhile, I may be able|to get you out of camp.
{45383}{45441}I'll speak to the general tonight.
{45489}{45549}-What's the matter?|-Nothing.
{45573}{45619}You do want to go, don't you?
{45622}{45663}Yes, but I mean...
{45687}{45745}I must think about it a little.
{45755}{45840}-What is there to think about?|-I don't know.
{45842}{45920}But it's so important,|and I need a little time.
{45938}{45979}You know, to think.
{46031}{46080}Take all the time you wish.
{46131}{46199}-Kitty?|-Yes?
{46223}{46324}-Don't be mad at me.|-Of course not.
{46371}{46444}It's getting late. You|better finish your steak.
{46661}{46745}Fine thing, what you want to do for Karen.
{46759}{46794}She told you?
{46817}{46872}She is worried about her father.
{46902}{46962}I didn't know that her father was alive.
{46964}{47053}When Karen was six,|he smuggled her out of Germany to Denmark.
{47066}{47141}After the war she went|back to find her parents.
{47152}{47212}The Jewish Agency had records of the dead.
{47215}{47268}She found her mother on the Dachau list...
{47270}{47325}...together with her two younger brothers.
{47328}{47421}About the father there was nothing,|so naturally she hopes he is still alive.
{47424}{47471}Maybe in Palestine.
{47472}{47519}As a matter of fact, there|is such a possibility.
{47522}{47613}He was a very important scientist.|The Nazis could have spared his life...
{47615}{47698}...in order to use his brain.|But of course, who knows?
{47743}{47819}It's curious|that she didn't mention her father to me.
{47822}{47881}You must understand something|about these children.
{47884}{47956}Their past is scarred.|They're ashamed of it.
{47974}{48077}To have a parent who has been persecuted,|or killed in a concentration camp...
{48079}{48176}...is a reproach to them.|They feel guilty for having survived.
{48178}{48253}So they pretend the bad|things never happened.
{48278}{48353}To take such a child is|a great responsibility...
{48365}{48448}-...even a sacrifice.|-It's no sacrifice.
{48456}{48553}I'm alone. The insurance I got after|my husband's death is more than enough.
{48556}{48661}I didn't mean financial sacrifice,|although it's a good thing to have money.
{48663}{48718}No, what I meant was,
{48719}{48775}you will have to make|a sacrifice of yourself.
{48778}{48839}These children who have lost everything...
{48842}{48904}...spend their lives|searching for new parents.
{48906}{49016}Their need reaches out to your heart|as naturally as a flower turns to the sun.
{49018}{49053}And they trap you.
{49055}{49167}Because they've been so long without love,|they demand all the love you have.
{49177}{49254}Karen will drain you of|love. She'll exhaust you.
{49302}{49350}That's exactly what I need.
{49498}{49553}I'd like to go with you, Kitty.
{49574}{49617}If you still want me.
{50530}{50558}-Morning.|-Morning.
{50561}{50633}-Bowen, 23rd GT Company.|-What can I do for you, sir?
{50636}{50701}Afraid I'll to have to|draw rather heavily on you.
{50704}{50759}-Please have a chair.|-Thank you.
{50806}{50881}This does draw us down a bit.|Excuse me a moment.
{50895}{50940}-Operator.|-CO, please.
{50962}{50989}Won't take a minute.
{50992}{51051}I hope not. As you can see, I'm in a hurry.
{51054}{51121}-CO speaking.|-Hall here, sir.
{51130}{51217}I've an order at transport|pool, sir, for 14 lorries...
{51242}{51311}...4 motorcycles, 18 drivers and 18 guards.
{51317}{51367}Estimated use four hours, sir.
{51374}{51431}-What's this for?|-Transport from Karaolos, sir.
{51434}{51481}-Who is requesting this?|-Capt. Bowen.
{51484}{51568}-What authority?|-Sir Cecil Bradshaw, of the Colonial office.
{51570}{51627}-Yes.|-Countersigned Lt. Gen. Sutherland.
{51630}{51697}-Well, allocate it then.|-Yes, of course, sir.
{51699}{51754}-What's the query?|-I thought you might want...
{51757}{51805}...to draw extra transport|from headquarters.
{51808}{51874}-Don't babble on, man. Give it to him.|-Yes, sir.
{51877}{51915}And get on with it.
{51918}{51950}Very good, sir.
{51968}{52036}Smithers. Take this and|get it filled at once.
{52038}{52105}-Yes, sir.|-We'll have you taken care of in a jiff.
{52108}{52155}Can I order tea for you?
{52170}{52243}Rather prefer a gin and|tonic, if you don't mind.
{52781}{52847}-Bowen, 23rd transport company.|-Lt. Arnold, sir.
{52850}{52900}I want to see the|Palestinian camp commander.
{52902}{52943}Right this way, sir.
{53226}{53299}This is the Palestinian commander,|David Ben Ami.
{53302}{53342}-How do you do?|-How do you do?
{53345}{53432}We are relocating all the internees|from the Star of David.
{53434}{53477}Here are your orders.
{53510}{53566}Where are you taking these people?
{53569}{53652}Their destination is not|included in your orders, Mr...
{53670}{53714}-Ben Ami.|-Yes. Thank you.
{53717}{53785}These people have not recovered|from their last journey.
{53788}{53844}I cannot permit them|to travel again so soon,
{53845}{53901}just because of a piece of paper.
{53931}{53967}Piece of paper?
{54011}{54096}-This seems perfectly clear to me.|-Sir, some of these people are sick.
{54098}{54152}You will turn the internees over at once.
{54154}{54216}I'm sorry. I just cannot|accept that responsibility.
{54218}{54269}I'll take the responsibility.
{54422}{54513}-There, does that satisfy you?|-Of course, I don't approve, but...
{54516}{54577}...I guess it makes the record perfect.
{54580}{54649}Would you order him|to place all his Palestinian...
{54651}{54718}...administrative personnel at my disposal|while loading?
{54721}{54765}-Did you hear?|-Yes, sir.
{54780}{54843}You can call on me|if you run into any trouble, sir.
{54846}{54885}Thanks, old chap.
{54904}{54952}Well, let's get about it.
{55016}{55047}Attention.
{55099}{55184}All passengers from the Star of David,|listen carefully.
{55219}{55305}We have received orders|to evacuate you immediately.
{55315}{55422}I repeat. All those who arrived|on the Star of David...
{55438}{55493}...are to be evacuated at once.
{55500}{55606}{lease prepare to board the British lorries|now passing through the camp.
{55620}{55702}Report at once|to your nearest {Palestinian guard point.
{55966}{56037}What does this mean? HMJFC?
{56057}{56140}His Majesty's Jewish Forces on Cyprus,|what else?
{56938}{56977}-What's going on?|-Military police.
{56979}{57045}They're blocking the intersection|for through traffic.
{57047}{57084}I don't understand.
{57098}{57153}Go and find the commanding|officer, will you?
{57155}{57233}I'd better look into this myself.|Excuse me, Mrs. Fremont.
{57343}{57375}Stay here.
{57579}{57652}-Sergeant, clear the way for my car.|-Yes, sir.
{57780}{57829}I'm afraid this is most unusual.
{57832}{57889}We've had no warning.|I'll check with headquarters.
{57891}{57930}These orders are perfectly clear.
{57933}{58017}Signed by the Colonial Office|and countersigned by Gen. Sutherland.
{58020}{58065}What's this? The whole area's tied up.
{58068}{58097}-Who's in charge?|-O'Hara.
{58100}{58145}Permit me. Bowen, 23rd GT Company.
{58147}{58198}Special detail, orders of Gen. Sutherland.
{58201}{58245}Here are the papers, sir.
{58306}{58399}Well, Bowen, I see you're going to be|getting rid of some Jews for us?
{58402}{58482}-Yes, sir. Shipping them back to Hamburg.|-That's where they belong.
{58485}{58543}It's a German matter.|Let the Germans handle it.
{58546}{58605}Apparently the general's|had second thoughts.
{58607}{58649}Why do you question these orders?
{58651}{58719}I didn't question.|I just wanted to check with headquarters.
{58722}{58794}Countersigning is not the responsibility|of junior officers.
{58797}{58853}The acceptance of responsibility...
{58856}{58927}...is what makes senior|officers out of juniors.
{58978}{59030}-Let them through.|-Yes, sir.
{59044}{59098}Should have started this|policy two years ago.
{59101}{59169}I don't care about the|Jews one way or the other.
{59172}{59242}-But they are troublemakers.|-No question about it, sir.
{59245}{59301}Get two of them together,|you've got a debate...
{59304}{59339}...and three, a revolution.
{59342}{59391}Yes. And half of them are Communists anyway.
{59394}{59453}Yes, and the other half pawnbrokers.
{59463}{59549}They look funny, too. I|can spot one a mile away.
{59602}{59674}Would you mind looking into my eye?|It feels like a cinder.
{59676}{59706}Certainly.
{59769}{59863}You know, a lot of them|try to hide under Gentile names.
{59900}{59969}But one look at that|face, and you just know.
{59974}{60031}With a little experience,|you can smell them out.
{60034}{60125}-I'm sorry, I can't find a thing.|-Must've been my imagination. Thanks.
{60350}{60452}Maj. Caldwell, are they taking everybody|who was on the Star of David?
{60482}{60561}-Yes, ma'am, we are.|-Then Karen's on one of those trucks.
{60565}{60591}Karen?
{60608}{60630}Karen Hansen.
{60633}{60701}I have Gen. Sutherland's permission|to take her to America.
{60704}{60782}-We were on our way to pick up the girl.|-How old is she?
{60785}{60842}Fourteen. She was assigned to the hospital.
{60873}{60909}Yes, it seems to me...
{60912}{60952}Is that the girl that the...
{60954}{61028}...forgot his name, the camp commander,|was talking about?
{61031}{61107}David Ben Ami? Yes.|He knew she was supposed go with me.
{61110}{61187}I remember. He told me|the general had made arrangements for her...
{61190}{61247}...so I left her behind,|on my own responsibility.
{61250}{61313}-Very good, Bowen.|-Thank you very much.
{61351}{61421}I appreciate your help.|Convey my respects to the general.
{61424}{61456}That I will.
{61472}{61542}-Bit of a Jew himself, you know.|-Not really?
{61569}{61606}Good luck, sir.
{62330}{62378}Remember, I've been in Palestine.
{62381}{62442}I know what kind of life|she'll live, if she lives.
{62445}{62475}I grant you that.
{62478}{62567}Besides, she must have been forced,|otherwise she would've left a note.
{62570}{62641}We'll get her back for|you, one way or another.
{62667}{62717}With her consent, of course.
{62786}{62847}Who was in charge of this evacuation?
{62854}{62910}Chap named Bowen, sir. Capt. Bowen.
{62913}{62970}-What did he look like?|-Look like?
{62981}{63031}A well set up sort of chap.
{63035}{63094}Proper bearing, decent decorations.
{63141}{63179}Spoke like any of us.
{63182}{63265}-From what command?|-23rd GT Company, sir.
{63306}{63365}-Is anything irregular?|-Could be.
{63370}{63441}We don't list a 23rd GT Company on Cyprus.
{63460}{63503}You should have known that.
{63536}{63571}Yes, I should.
{63587}{63670}-Perhaps I made an error.|-It's human.
{63684}{63743}Who issued Capt. Bowen's orders?
{63764}{63836}They originated with Bradshaw|of the Colonial Office.
{63839}{63872}And, of course, you signed them.
{63874}{63978}-You examined the signatures?|-Well, naturally, and I countersigned.
{63981}{64016}I signed no such order.
{64018}{64099}Neither have I seen such an order|from the Colonial Office.
{64150}{64217}Well, those signatures must've been forged?
{64250}{64344}We can't exclude the possibility.|With one exception, of course.
{64346}{64456}-Your signature was genuine, wasn't it?|-Someone had to take responsibility, sir.
{64465}{64524}And you took it. Now you've got it.
{64534}{64591}What do you propose to do with it?
{64670}{64701}That boat...
{64733}{64771}That Olympia...
{64789}{64868}She's not going to Hamburg.|She's probably heading for Palestine.
{64870}{64903}Undoubtedly.
{64908}{64980}Telephone control, tell|them to block the harbor.
{64987}{65038}Take a look at the situation yourself.
{65041}{65076}Very well, sir.
{65126}{65167}Mrs. Fremont. Sir.
{65438}{65486}Let me have the microphone.
{65590}{65657}Attention, Olympia. Attention, out there.
{65681}{65734}This is Maj. Caldwell speaking.
{65743}{65782}Attention, Olympia.
{65802}{65855}You have no chance to escape.
{65862}{65957}The destroyer Zebra is moving into position|to block the harbor entrance.
{65996}{66032}Return to dock.
{66050}{66100}Otherwise we will board you.
{66171}{66245}We're bound for Palestine|with an American captain and crew...
{66248}{66309}...and a passenger manifest of 611 persons.
{66312}{66405}We're carrying 200 pounds of dynamite|in the engine room with fuses attached.
{66408}{66497}You let one British soldier step aboard|this ship and we'll blow her up.
{66500}{66548}Have you heard me, Major?
{66560}{66598}Message received.
{66637}{66703}Where would they find|200 pounds of dynamite?
{66716}{66776}-Get me Gen. Sutherland.|-Operator.
{66778}{66852}-Connect me to Gen. Sutherland.|-Yes, sir.
{66877}{66946}In an ammunition dump, you blithering idiot.
{66966}{67026}-Sutherland here.|-Caldwell here, sir.
{67038}{67150}The Olympia threatens to blow herself|out of the water, sir, if we board her.
{67164}{67245}I'm convinced it's a bluff, of course.|Boarding party en route, sir.
{67256}{67304}Call your boarding party back.
{67306}{67389}Signal the Olympia.|I'm asking London for instructions.
{67403}{67479}If she stays where she|is, no one will molest her.
{67610}{67698}They've threatened to dynamite|the Olympia if we board her.
{67708}{67756}Do you think they mean it?
{67767}{67820}Nearly two years ago, a Haganah ship
{67821}{67874}which we were detaining|in the port of Haifa...
{67876}{67967}...did blow herself up. 236 refugees died.
{67990}{68061}General, I simply must|get Karen off the ship.
{68071}{68132}Would you care to go on board the Olympia...
{68135}{68192}...and learn from the child|exactly what happened?
{68194}{68261}-Will they let me?|-I'll try and arrange it.
{68263}{68337}If I succeed, you can|do me a favor in return.
{68340}{68369}I'll do anything.
{68371}{68430}If force, or coercion of any kind,
{68431}{68490}was used to get that|child on board the ship...
{68495}{68569}...you must promise me to|tell the entire story...
{68572}{68637}...at a press conference|which I shall arrange.
{68640}{68693}-Do you agree?|-I'll be glad to.
{68778}{68806}Reuben?
{68820}{68898}Send this every 10 minutes,|and keep on sending it.
{68922}{68969}-Could we interrupt, please?|-Yes.
{68972}{69062}This is Dr. de Vries. We elevated ourselves|into a medical committee.
{69065}{69088}Good.
{69090}{69193}It's our opinion the sanitary arrangements|on this ship are hopelessly inadequate.
{69195}{69283}Unless we make some additional|bathing and toilet facilities...
{69286}{69334}...we'll have a serious health problem.
{69337}{69381}All right, we'll try to take care of it.
{69384}{69473}There he is. This is Mrs. Fremont,|from Gen. Sutherland.
{69482}{69533}-How do you do? Hank?|-Yes.
{69536}{69615}We have enough scrap lumber|to build privies on deck?
{69618}{69638}I guess so.
{69641}{69706}Ten-holers. Knock some|showers together, too.
{69709}{69732}Okay.
{69735}{69809}-Anything else?|-Not for the present, thank you.
{69819}{69861}This one to Haifa.
{69886}{69929}You wanted to see me?
{69931}{69965}Yes, Captain.
{69974}{70043}"Yes, Captain." His|Majesty's Jewish Brigade.
{70055}{70143}North Africa, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.|The decorations are real.
{70146}{70213}Is that what Sutherland|sent you to find out?
{70217}{70314}You lied to me about the girl.|She's not at the camp, she's on this ship.
{70317}{70359}And you forced her to come aboard.
{70362}{70429}-We don't force anybody. Tel Aviv yet?|-No.
{70431}{70455}Go on.
{70466}{70490}You're not listening.
{70493}{70578}I heard every word you said.|I lied to you about the girl. What else?
{70581}{70620}I'm taking her off this death trap.
{70622}{70717}Don't tell me what you'll do on this ship.|You'll do exactly what I tell you.
{70719}{70777}-Tel Aviv beginning to send.|-Fine.
{70784}{70841}How do you know the girl wants to get off?
{70851}{70911}I am trying to save a Jewish child.
{70929}{71011}Can't you understand that?|Don't you have any respect for human life?
{71018}{71082}Don't expect me to get hysterical|over one Jewish child...
{71085}{71203}...and don't you get hysterical, either.|You're late, lady. You're 10 years late.
{71214}{71285}Almost 2,000,000 Jewish children,|butchered like animals...
{71287}{71324}...because nobody wanted them.
{71326}{71393}No country would have them.|Not your country or any other.
{71396}{71458}And nobody wants the ones who survived.
{71481}{71539}Jewish flesh is cheap, lady.|It's cheaper than beef.
{71542}{71586}It is cheaper, even, than herring.
{71589}{71634}You and your respect...
{71650}{71693}Tel Aviv complete now.
{71706}{71765}If you can find the|girl, if she wants to go,
{71766}{71824}take her. Take a dozen if you want to.
{72664}{72692}Kitty!
{72766}{72829}It happened so fast,|I couldn't even leave you a note.
{72832}{72895}I had to go, Kitty, to find my father.
{72898}{72940}When you asked me to go to America,
{72941}{72983}I didn't know, and...
{72992}{73047}Kitty, we're going to Palestine.
{73051}{73124}Karen, you don't know what|it's like in Palestine.
{73126}{73182}And the British won't let you go, anyhow.
{73185}{73245}They'll have to, Kitty.|They'll just have to.
{73248}{73324}Because we're not going back to Karaolos,|not ever.
{73330}{73396}Then let me take you to Palestine.|I can find a way.
{73398}{73422}The man in charge, Mr...
{73423}{73447}Ben Canaan?
{73450}{73474}Yes.
{73477}{73557}If you want to come with me,|you have his permission.
{73571}{73621}I couldn't leave now, Kitty.
{73646}{73725}I don't know how to explain it|to someone like you.
{73729}{73827}But we all came here together,|and now we're trying to do something.
{73830}{73874}And I must stay here, Kitty.
{73877}{73941}Gen. Sutherland calling the Olympia.
{73978}{74041}This is the Exodus. Come in, General.
{74055}{74135}I have received instructions|from the Colonial Office in London.
{74138}{74208}No attempt will be made|to board the Olympia...
{74210}{74273}...but the harbor will remain blocked.
{74275}{74345}You may return to|Karaolos whenever you wish.
{74354}{74408}If you choose to remain in the ship...
{74410}{74501}...provisions and medical supplies|will be sent to you as you need them.
{74507}{74541}Message completed.
{74543}{74579}Not even now?
{74610}{74638}Kitty...
{74641}{74676}...I couldn't.
{74697}{74772}It's like leaving your|family when things are bad.
{74816}{74843}I know.
{74876}{74920}If you want anything, let me know.
{74922}{74984}Yes. Gen. Sutherland's your friend.
{74994}{75053}Tell him to let us go to Palestine.
{75247}{75348}They're just going to turn this ship|into another concentration camp.
{75419}{75471}Go back? Nonsense.
{75481}{75563}Did we escape for just ourselves alone? No.
{75572}{75658}We've done it for hundreds of thousands|of Jews all over Europe...
{75661}{75693}...who couldn't get out.
{75696}{75749}Also it makes news. World news.
{75751}{75810}I want your attention for a minute.
{75825}{75903}Now you all heard Gen. Sutherland|on the loudspeaker.
{75916}{75968}You must now make a decision.
{75971}{76008}You can go back to Karaolos...
{76013}{76096}The only way to go back to Karaolos|is by crawling!
{76106}{76150}...or you can stay aboard this ship.
{76153}{76222}Who are you making the propaganda for?|Them or us?
{76294}{76376}Quiet, please. There's another possibility.
{76403}{76467}You were picked by Haganah for this ship...
{76470}{76556}...so that your escape to {Palestine|would have some meaning to the world.
{76558}{76614}If you still want it to have some meaning...
{76617}{76712}...if you want to finish what we began,|you can go on a hunger strike.
{76714}{76781}Now you're beginning to make a little sense!
{76783}{76874}We shall tell to the British,|"We spit on your food."
{76958}{77054}And the little food we've got here,|we shall throw overboard.
{77138}{77238}We are going to Palestine,|or we're going to die right here.
{77294}{77340}Listen, please.
{77366}{77428}Now just stop and think for a minute.
{77442}{77521}To go on a hunger strike|is a very serious business...
{77535}{77564}...because once you strike...
{77566}{77638}...it can only end when you have won|or when you are dead.
{77641}{77748}What is so unusual about the Jews dying?|Is that anything new?
{77769}{77808}I stay right here.
{77819}{77889}There is no excuse for us to go on living...
{77892}{77954}...unless we start fighting right now.
{77968}{78031}So that every Jew on|the face of the earth...
{78033}{78107}...can begin to start feeling|like a human being again.
{78110}{78151}You heard what I said.
{78153}{78199}Fight, not beg!
{78213}{78241}Fight!
{78333}{78368}Wait a minute.
{78407}{78459}Everybody aboard this ship...
{78462}{78527}...agreed to accept Haganah discipline.
{78539}{78586}I am now giving an order.
{78598}{78634}We will sit down...
{78650}{78714}...and we will maintain|silence for 20 minutes.
{78736}{78803}Each one of us will|listen to his own heart...
{78806}{78853}...and to his brain, too.
{78869}{78913}And then we will vote.
{78939}{78991}We will now maintain silence.
{79367}{79420}I saw the people on that ship.
{79424}{79509}They're not dangerous.|They're just poor, miserable people.
{79512}{79560}Why can't you let them go?
{79570}{79660}You must understand that we British|have shown, throughout our history...
{79662}{79746}...an extraordinary talent|for troublesome commitments.
{79769}{79844}Palestine is a British|mandate imposed upon us...
{79854}{79898}...by the League of Nations...
{79901}{79976}...which makes us responsible|for keeping peace in the area.
{79978}{80089}The Arabs simply won't keep the peace|if we allow further Jewish immigration.
{80094}{80143}I don't know much about the mandate.
{80145}{80234}But I do know the Jews|were promised a homeland in Palestine.
{80248}{80295}During the First World War,
{80296}{80344}Britain needed and|accepted Jewish support...
{80347}{80389}...from all over the world.
{80392}{80425}In return...
{80428}{80515}...the Balfour Declaration of 1917|made such a promise.
{80521}{80604}That promise was reconfirmed|during World War ll.
{80611}{80695}This chap Ben Canaan probably wasn't lying|when he said he fought with us.
{80697}{80751}Thousands of Palestinians did.
{80759}{80832}How can you promise something|and then not deliver it?
{80856}{80932}England was fighting for her life in 1917.
{80942}{81019}Nations are very like people|in such circumstances.
{81022}{81102}They make promises|they're not immediately able to fulfill.
{81105}{81185}During that same crisis,|we made the Arabs certain assurances.
{81187}{81247}Hence, they have their claims, too.
{81255}{81344}The Arabs are fanatics|on the subject of Jewish immigration.
{81356}{81408}Just now, we need their goodwill.
{81412}{81481}-How is it ever going to end?|-I don't know.
{81499}{81567}The whole question now|is before the United Nations.
{81570}{81611}I hope they solve it.
{81614}{81708}The sooner I stop operating detention camps,|the happier I'll be.
{81712}{81794}That goes for every British officer|and soldier I know.
{81862}{81893}Thank you.
{81918}{81942}Yes?
{81980}{82010}The devil.
{82029}{82057}Of course.
{82059}{82149}Send a boat alongside at once.|I'll join you in 10 minutes.
{82192}{82261}They want to send 23|people back to Karaolos.
{82264}{82328}The rest have declared a hunger strike.
{82424}{82490}-Can I drop you at your hotel?|-Of course.
{83474}{83549}...a few news bulletins,|and an announcement.
{83553}{83656}The evacuation of 2,000 British women|and children from {Palestine...
{83665}{83721}...was ordered today by|the High Commissioner.
{83726}{83839}The United Nations Commission on {Palestine|still has not submitted its report.
{83854}{83897}The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem...
{83900}{83968}...who sat out the war as|Hitler's guest in Berlin...
{83970}{84065}...has met in Aley, Lebanon,|with representatives of the Arab nations...
{84068}{84147}...to coordinate action|against {Palestinian Jews...
{84150}{84208}...in the event {partition is granted.
{84226}{84325}The UN Commission on {Palestine|has arrived at Flushing Meadows...
{84328}{84425}...and is now preparing its final|recommendation for the assembly.
{84429}{84481}News of the hunger strike|aboard the Exodus...
{84484}{84565}...received front-page treatment|this morning throughout the world.
{84568}{84657}The British embassy in Washington|is already being picketed.
{84678}{84773}Now Dr. Odenheim has something to say to you|for the medical committee.
{84775}{84874}It is very important|that we save our supply of fresh water.
{84886}{84984}So we must ration it.|Every four hours, one cup.
{85000}{85081}On the other hand,|everyone must wash his body daily.
{85085}{85137}This will be done with seawater.
{85139}{85229}Your platoon leader will call|when your turn comes.
{85254}{85326}It is advised to conserve your energy.
{85341}{85431}So all necessary physical work|should be divided...
{85434}{85493}...among as many people as possible.
{85524}{85631}If at any time you should feel lightheaded|or dizzy, do not be frightened.
{85634}{85687}It is, in no respect, serious.
{85689}{85778}Just sit down|and lower your head between your knees.
{85808}{85874}All of us, of course, feel stomach pangs.
{85878}{85965}-They are uncomfortable, but not dangerous.|-That's right.
{85967}{86000}Final point...
{86003}{86100}...people can live a long time without food,|a very long time.
{86145}{86208}Attention, everybody.
{86234}{86328}Here is the news,|and some of it, I'm sorry to say, not good.
{86352}{86449}Dov Gruner and three other leaders|of the Irgun in {Palestine...
{86452}{86512}...were hanged today in Acre prison.
{86519}{86601}The United Nations Commission|on {Palestine is still delaying...
{86603}{86676}...its recommendations|to the General Assembly.
{86691}{86779}Winston Churchill has called on|the Labor government to end what he calls...
{86782}{86876}"...this squalid war against the Jews, "|with all possible speed.
{86899}{86960}-500 Americans picketed...|-Your water, gentlemen.
{86963}{87065}...UN headquarters in Flushing|Meadows, demanded release-
{87070}{87120}Your platoon's turn to bathe, Mr. Lakavitch.
{87134}{87170}Your turn to bathe.
{87178}{87248}Mr. Smolikov, will you please do me a favor?
{87250}{87354}Refresh yourself with my bath,|and then, little bit later, I'll take yours.
{87357}{87389}-All right.|-Thank you.
{87392}{87450}Sorry, Mr. Lakavitch. You know the rules.
{87453}{87533}-Can't you see the position?|-No exceptions.
{87558}{87622}I think you carry this bathing too far.
{87630}{87711}-No exceptions, Mr. Lakavitch.|-Fanatics!
{87737}{87817}...establishment of a Jewish state|in the Holy Land.
{87842}{87916}Thirteen leaders of our|National Committee in Tel Aviv...
{87918}{88004}...have begun a hunger strike|in sympathy with the Exodus.
{88017}{88104}When more news comes in, I'll report it.|That's all.
{88126}{88166}Have you time for me, Ari?
{88169}{88225}Always, Dr. Odenheim. What can I do?
{88227}{88268}We made a mistake...
{88278}{88364}...a bad mistake in letting the children|be a part of this.
{88367}{88463}A child's body grows every hour.|They need food more than adults.
{88474}{88527}Their blood requires more sugar.
{88532}{88576}What should we do about it?
{88578}{88640}When a mistake is made, you admit it...
{88658}{88720}...you analyze it, and you correct it.
{88754}{88805}Doctor, don't you feel well?
{88810}{88869}Who cares if an old man feels well?
{89371}{89398}Major!
{89412}{89485}-Who the devil are you?|-Jorgenson, of the UP.
{89491}{89545}-Thanks, Major.|-All right.
{89882}{89943}What is this?
{89951}{90024}-Information, sir.|-Information for whom?
{90041}{90132}For the tourists, of course.|One of our many special services.
{90172}{90221}And I suppose these are tourists?
{90224}{90289}No, sir. These people are contributors.
{90296}{90362}We are collecting|donations for the Red Cross.
{90365}{90420}Forgive me.
{90667}{90734}What did you say?|What were you two talking about?
{90737}{90765}I said to him:
{90767}{90845}"These are nice fat ones,|for this the archbishop will bless you."
{90848}{90905}He said to me, "l do my share."
{90913}{90960}Word for word, a literal translation.
{90963}{91055}Don't try to deceive me.|You're collecting all this for the Olympia.
{91058}{91140}-You see through me like a piece of glass.|-Complete waste of time.
{91142}{91197}They won't accept food|from us, nor from you.
{91200}{91290}True, but they will accept|from the Red Cross when they sail.
{91293}{91335}Perhaps you're right.
{91383}{91439}What do you mean, "when they sail"?
{91460}{91553}It was my poor way of expressing|confidence in British justice.
{91586}{91614}Good day.
{91979}{92061}You'd better go up and tell them.|Give me a hand here.
{92099}{92144}Let us through, please.
{92439}{92551}It gives me great pain to inform you|Dr. Odenheim has suffered a heart attack.
{92572}{92604}He is dead.
{92678}{92721}Shall I send it out?
{92818}{92849}Why not?
{92899}{92957}Professor Dr. Samuel Odenheim...
{92982}{93040}...head of the first clinic|for Internal Medicine...
{93042}{93142}...at the University of Vienna,|author of many medical textbooks...
{93155}{93231}...died today in the harbor of Famagusta...
{93267}{93324}...on board a cramped|freighter going nowhere,
{93325}{93381}because there wasn't room|for him on this earth.
{93390}{93441}Ought to make news somewhere.
{93589}{93669}Attention, please.|{prepare all children under the age of 13...
{93672}{93743}...for return to Karaolos. This is an order.
{93852}{93905}-Out to the ship once more?|-Yes.
{93907}{93986}You know, they're in their 92nd hour,|and starting to crack already.
{93989}{94048}-I didn't know that.|-Fading fast.
{94053}{94103}They never would have|started this nonsense...
{94105}{94157}...if Ben Canaan hadn't held a gun to them.
{94160}{94220}-Do you really think so?|-Undoubtedly.
{94228}{94306}Poor, ruddy beggars.|I don't see how you stand them.
{94468}{94529}Then let me ask you this, if I may.
{94562}{94621}Do you have the power|to call off this strike?
{94623}{94651}I have.
{94693}{94757}If a compelling reason turned up. Why?
{94765}{94800}Then call it off.
{94802}{94861}I've been talking to Gen. Sutherland.
{94864}{94939}He's a humane man,|but there's nothing he can do.
{94947}{95024}You've made the issue so flatly|that no one can help you.
{95026}{95110}I know it, I feel it.|Either you compromise, or you lose.
{95140}{95174}We won't lose.
{95189}{95246}If the British give in|and let us go, we've won.
{95249}{95330}And if we starve to death aboard this ship,|we've still won.
{95333}{95367}They'll wait.
{95379}{95470}They'll wait until you're too weak|and then come aboard and take you off.
{95473}{95568}It doesn't take much strength|to set off 200 pounds of dynamite.
{95589}{95650}You'd still set it off, knowing you've lost?
{95653}{95684}Of course.
{95701}{95781}Without any regard|for the lives you'd be destroying?
{95792}{95856}With every regard in the world for them.
{95862}{95903}I don't understand.
{95917}{95987}Each person on board this ship is a soldier.
{95999}{96093}The only weapon we have to fight with|is our willingness to die.
{96135}{96177}But for what purpose?
{96201}{96240}Call it publicity.
{96251}{96291}-Publicity?|-Yes, publicity.
{96294}{96345}A stunt to attract attention.
{96365}{96415}A letter to the newspapers.
{96433}{96526}A help-wanted ad to the official journal|of the United Nations.
{96557}{96636}"Wanted by 600 men,|women and children, a country...
{96654}{96703}"...a native land, a home."
{96720}{96766}That's all they're dying for.
{96769}{96827}Just to call attention to Israel...
{96829}{96897}...without ever having seen it themselves.
{96919}{96972}Does the vulgarity of it shock you?
{97035}{97120}You can't fight the whole British Empire|with 600 people.
{97134}{97160}It isn't possible.
{97163}{97223}How many Minutemen did you have|when they fired...
{97225}{97265}...the "shot heard round the world"?
{97268}{97309}-I don't know.|-77.
{97355}{97405}Look, please understand me.
{97437}{97479}I wish you could win.
{97488}{97577}I wish it were possible for you|to have a country of your own.
{97579}{97613}But it isn't.
{97619}{97666}You're offering the|lives of all these people
{97667}{97714}for something that can never happen.
{97717}{97772}I know. I've been in Palestine.
{97797}{97854}-When were you there?|-A year ago.
{97879}{97981}Mr. Ben Canaan, even if you get a partition|and a free Jewish state...
{98009}{98056}...the Arabs won't let you keep it.
{98058}{98141}500,000 Jews against 50 million Arabs?
{98160}{98190}You can't win.
{98261}{98304}You think I'm a fool.
{98322}{98402}But I came to appeal to you|to call off the hunger strike...
{98405}{98440}...and avoid a tragedy.
{98443}{98507}Why don't you appeal to Gen. Sutherland?
{98509}{98550}What can I tell him?
{98581}{98637}Tell him what God said to Moses:
{98650}{98741}"Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,|'Thus saith the Lord:
{98769}{98840}"'Let my people go,|that they may serve me."'
{98881}{98932}Exodus, Chapter 7, Verse 26.
{99013}{99089}We have been asked to talk to you,|Mr. Ben Canaan.
{99091}{99143}-Do you have time?|-Of course.
{99188}{99219}Excuse me.
{99541}{99609}We have made a decision among the mothers.
{99611}{99689}To send the children back to Karaolos now|will show weakness.
{99691}{99769}The British will see that we are|not serious people aboard this ship.
{99772}{99817}It doesn't matter what the British think.
{99820}{99909}I cannot take the responsibility|for letting children starve to death.
{99911}{99955}We will take the responsibility.
{99957}{100025}We will not send them back,|and we will not go back with them.
{100036}{100113}I'm sorry, Mrs. Frankel.|The children must go back.
{100121}{100195}You go back if you want to with them.|Now, that's a Haganah order.
{100197}{100293}You're an important man,|Mr. Ari Ben Canaan, but you know nothing.
{100296}{100381}Look at these babies of mine.|Born behind barbed wire.
{100412}{100464}For the first time they don't have to
{100465}{100517}look out through a fence|like little animals.
{100520}{100573}They are free now, and nobody...
{100578}{100664}...no Englishman, no Haganah,|will ever lock them up again.
{100667}{100719}Look at Mrs. Hirschberg here.
{100721}{100804}Hers will be the first,|when she has no more milk to give.
{100807}{100901}-Tell him.|-I will not take him back to Karaolos.
{100903}{101017}He will go to Palestine with me,|or here on this ship, we will die together.
{101020}{101063}I will not take him back.
{101336}{101396}When are you going to stop this thing|and let them go?
{101399}{101454}Unfortunately, I can't answer that.
{101455}{101510}The affair's entirely|in the hands of London.
{101513}{101593}But you don't like what's going on.|You know how wrong it is.
{101596}{101636}Why don't you say so?
{101637}{101677}Why don't you make a|public statement about it?
{101679}{101749}I can't do that, Kitty. I'm a soldier.
{101756}{101846}I know you're a soldier,|but you're also a Jew...
{101849}{101913}...and all these people|out there are Jews, too.
{101920}{102022}I don't like to disappoint you,|but I'm not in any degree a Jew.
{102037}{102089}-But I thought...|-I know the rumor.
{102092}{102135}There had to be some explanation...
{102137}{102204}...for my attitude|towards this unpleasant business.
{102272}{102377}-I'm sorry for flying off like that.|-You're getting to be quite a Zionist.
{102422}{102485}As a matter of fact,|I'm glad you did fly off.
{102510}{102596}You asked how l, as a Jew,|could let this happen to other Jews.
{102609}{102692}Now I find myself asking|how can any man let it happen?
{102697}{102769}Jew, Gentile, Buddhist, Mohammedan...
{102780}{102825}...no matter what he is.
{103173}{103266}Signal the air base.|I'm flying to London within the hour.
{103578}{103653}You know, you're an interesting woman,|Mrs. Fremont.
{103681}{103749}Sutherland won't let one member|of the press come aboard...
{103751}{103817}...and you shuttle back and forth|like a carrier pigeon.
{103823}{103867}I know you suspect me,
{103868}{103913}and I know nothing I say|can make you trust me.
{103927}{104005}But I wanted to tell you|that Gen. Sutherland has left for London.
{104008}{104080}He understands your situation,|and he is trying to help.
{104083}{104106}Thanks.
{104152}{104181}Is that all?
{104257}{104312}I heard of Dr. Odenheim's death.
{104322}{104389}I'm a trained nurse,|and I worked with him at Karaolos.
{104403}{104476}If I can be useful, I'd|be glad to stay aboard.
{104479}{104509}Without food?
{104552}{104615}I think I can go without|food as long as you.
{104716}{104768}I'm glad to have you on board, Mrs. Fremont.
{104805}{104873}Glad to be aboard, Mr. Ben Canaan.
{105755}{105850}Whatever move you make,|you were dead 10 minutes ago.
{105853}{105914}I asked for an opinion from Romania?
{106013}{106069}Do you think the British will give in?
{106078}{106121}We'll give in first.
{106134}{106179}These schlemiels.
{106197}{106262}Maybe they think they've been hungry|once in a while.
{106267}{106345}They don't even begin to know|what real starvation is.
{106352}{106407}If you hate these people so much,
{106408}{106463}why do you want to go|to Palestine with them?
{106468}{106540}Because there, Jews fight instead of talk.
{106608}{106689}When I get there, I'm|going to join the Irgun.
{106716}{106753}They know how to do it.
{106776}{106869}I'm going to blow up every|British installation I can find.
{106893}{106938}I'm going to kill Englishmen...
{106947}{107000}...and kill and kill them...
{107013}{107061}...till there won't be any more.
{107064}{107157}-But the British aren't all bad.|-They're rotten, the whole bunch of them.
{107169}{107217}The British, all the|Russians, the Poles-
{107220}{107256}-Not the Danes.|When I was there-
{107257}{107292}Them, too. Don't tell me.
{107294}{107326}That's not true.
{107329}{107396}The Hansens were Christians,|and they adopted me.
{107438}{107505}One little exception. That proves something?
{107508}{107605}There are lots of exceptions.|You just listen to me for a minute.
{107621}{107679}When the Nazis marched into Denmark...
{107681}{107753}...they ordered every Jew|to wear a yellow armband...
{107755}{107809}...with the Star of David|on it. And when they-
{107812}{107874}-That's the worst thing that can happen?|-I said, listen!
{107877}{107928}You don't know what you're talking about.
{107933}{108025}The next morning, when every Jew in Denmark|had to wear his armband...
{108027}{108117}...King Christian came out of|Amalienborg Palace for his morning ride.
{108125}{108169}And do you know something?
{108172}{108210}He wore the Star of David on his arm.
{108211}{108247}-But why|should-
{108249}{108286}And you know something else?
{108289}{108369}By afternoon,|everybody was wearing Stars of David.
{108380}{108491}Jews and Danes, and, well, just everybody.
{108537}{108578}Why'd they do that?
{108665}{108761}If you don't just know|why they did it, Dov...
{108793}{108856}...well, maybe that's what's wrong with you.
{109134}{109196}-Get the Olympia. I want to talk to them.|-Yes, sir.
{109229}{109283}Control Headquarters calling the Olympia.
{109323}{109380}-Do you hear me?|-This is the Exodus.
{109383}{109420}Stand by for Maj. Caldwell.
{109423}{109500}You are no longer interested|in your last rook, Mr. Lakavitch?
{109502}{109546}We pause for politics?
{109554}{109673}Gen. Sutherland, at his own request,|has been relieved of his duties on Cyprus.
{109689}{109782}I have just received a message|from the Colonial Office. I quote:
{109810}{109862}"His Majesty's Government,
{109863}{109915}having no desire to witness|needless suffering...
{109925}{110002}"...grants permission|for the Olympia to sail to {Palestine...
{110009}{110090}"...and to disembark its passengers|at the port of Haifa. "
{110123}{110146}That is all.
{110674}{110721}Ari Ben Canaan!
{113619}{113666}Well, happy landing, Mrs. Fremont.
{113669}{113744}-You'll find your luggage at customs.|-Thank you.
{113747}{113795}Have you seen Mr. Ben Canaan?
{113796}{113844}I want to thank him for|letting me on the ship.
{113847}{113920}He and the other Haganah guys|went over the side two hours ago.
{113922}{113996}Too many British soldiers|on the reception committee.
{114373}{114429}-Karen?|-Have you seen Dov?
{114439}{114479}No, not since he left the ship.
{114481}{114554}-He was assigned to Gan Dafna.|-He'll show up.
{114561}{114645}I'm going to the American consulate|and then to the Jewish Agency.
{114648}{114714}As soon as I find anything,|I'll come to Gan Dafna.
{114717}{114741}Gan Dafna, all aboard.
{114744}{114823}-Bye, Karen.|-lf you see Dov, tell him where I am.
{116578}{116601}Inside.
{116871}{116962}This is no accident, he's got the address|written down. Fetch the car.
{117021}{117096}Here, you dirty little Irgun swine.
{117828}{117858}Hello?
{117958}{117986}Shalom.
{118095}{118156}Yaov, take the dog out.
{118169}{118194}Again?
{118197}{118259}A boy about 17 just went into Asa's house.
{118261}{118336}They took him in a police|car. Get a look at him.
{120269}{120320}-What's your name?|-Karen. What's yours?
{120323}{120390}Edna. Come, we'll go up and eat something.
{121507}{121597}Now, if you will please|resume a little order...
{121609}{121716}...I will introduce a man|who has done more than any other...
{121718}{121792}...to establish our village of Gan Dafna.
{121795}{121844}Only 10 days ago...
{121846}{121920}...he was in London,|negotiating with the British.
{121929}{121984}Today he is home again.
{122001}{122103}I have the honor to present|Mr. Barak Ben Canaan...
{122105}{122165}...member of the Executive Committee...
{122167}{122235}...of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.
{122410}{122491}My dear young friends,|I know you're very tired.
{122493}{122578}You've had a long trip,|so I'm not going to make speeches.
{122617}{122680}It's good to have parties like this.
{122689}{122747}But it's also good to|know what you're here for.
{122750}{122824}You are here to learn. You are here to work.
{122826}{122891}You are here to build|a Jewish homeland in Palestine.
{122909}{123016}It says on the banner|"young heroes." Very fine.
{123041}{123147}But here at Gan Dafna you will find|that even the biggest hero...
{123149}{123249}...must work in the fields,|just like the littlest coward.
{123272}{123365}Boys and girls,|when I came to Palestine 47 years ago...
{123367}{123460}...it was not a musical reception|with little cakes served.
{123469}{123559}I came walking, with my little brother...
{123585}{123638}...all the way from Russia.
{123662}{123756}And over in that valley,|the swamps, and mosquitoes so big...
{123759}{123814}...they were picking|fights with the sparrows.
{123833}{123925}Now we have changed those swamps|into such fields.
{123929}{124011}On a quiet night, you|can hear the corn grow.
{124033}{124095}Oranges so big...
{124113}{124168}...five already make a dozen.
{124207}{124297}Over there you see the|Arab village of Abu Yesha.
{124316}{124382}In those days, my old friend Kammal...
{124402}{124445}...may God rest his soul...
{124453}{124503}...was mukhtar of the village.
{124505}{124582}And then one day,|he donated to us this ground...
{124585}{124637}...on which you stand, for a youth village.
{124651}{124723}So, we began to build this place.
{124740}{124812}And again it wasn't a matter|of little cakes and music.
{124814}{124883}It meant more sweat, more work.
{124907}{124936}Look about you.
{124942}{124988}You will see Arab children here.
{124990}{125069}Three of them, grandsons|of that same Kammal...
{125071}{125117}...the mukhtar who gave us this land.
{125125}{125194}It grieves me that he isn't with us today|to see all this.
{125197}{125269}But he's been gathered|to the bosom of Allah.
{125281}{125341}Speak always that name with respect.
{125350}{125469}With us, instead,|we have the son of Kammal, Taha...
{125471}{125526}...an honor to his father's memory.
{125604}{125698}Raised part of the time in my house,|with my own dear son, Ari...
{125701}{125794}...and with my dear daughter, Jordana,|who sits beside him in this place.
{125797}{125882}I want you to give particular attention|to what he's going to tell to you.
{125885}{125989}Here is Taha, son of|Kammal, since five years...
{125992}{126049}...mukhtar of Abu Yesha.
{126107}{126213}Thank you, Barak Ben Canaan.|Village president, Dr. Ernst Lieberman.
{126258}{126361}In this valley of Jezreel,|we dwell together as friends.
{126386}{126438}It is natural that we should live in peace.
{126444}{126516}Since even our words for it|are almost exactly the same.
{126521}{126568}We say salaam...
{126575}{126624}...and you, shalom.
{126663}{126757}Let us seal our friendship forever|with that most beautiful of Hebrew toasts.
{126768}{126817}L'chaim, to life.
{126837}{126860}L'chaim!
{127189}{127218}Come on.
{127297}{127329}Dov Landau.
{127374}{127446}Immigration says you're legal,|so we've no reason to keep you.
{127449}{127505}The Jewish Agency sent a bus ticket|and lunch money.
{127507}{127544}You're assigned to Gan Dafna.
{127551}{127593}You take my advice and go there.
{127596}{127649}Don't hang around Haifa.|You'll get in trouble.
{127652}{127691}Don't wander into the Arab section.
{127693}{127770}Or you'll run into the Mufti's gangsters|and they'll kill you, son.
{127773}{127813}They'll slit your throat.
{127822}{127869}And keep away from the Irgun.
{129398}{129505}-And then, after the ghetto was destroyed?|-I hid in the sewers for five months.
{129507}{129538}Eating what?
{129557}{129645}When I couldn't sneak out at night|and steal garbage, I killed rats.
{129671}{129711}And then one night they caught me.
{129713}{129768}-And they sent you to Auschwitz?|-Yes.
{129793}{129852}To what work were you assigned in Auschwitz?
{129856}{129919}I told you that twice already.|It was mostly clean up.
{129921}{129999}-Cleaning up what?|-The camp area.
{130004}{130073}That's all there was to do.|That and working in the kitchens.
{130081}{130173}And when Auschwitz was liberated,|you walked to Germany?
{130193}{130232}You asked me that already, too.
{130235}{130295}May I talk with the young man for a moment?
{130321}{130404}So you want to blow up British installations|for the Irgun?
SIMON OF THE DESERT
For six years, six weeks and six days, you've stood on that column, Simon.
Your asceticism has edified us all.
Honor us now by mounting this other pedestal, presented to you through the munificence of this wealthy man.
From your new column you can continue to inspire our brothers by your penance in the footsteps of our father,
Simeon Stylites.
Accept this column as a gesture of our family's gratitude to you for curing me of an unspeakable disease.
Help me!
Let the holy man pass!
Help us, Father Simon.
Wait.
Your mother wishes to be near you until the hour of her passing.
Let her embrace you one last time.
It would have been better for you had you stayed in the peace of your home, woman.
Be dutiful, Simon, and receive her with gladness.
Stay near me if you so desire, Mother.
But I take my leave of you in this life with this embrace.
My love for you must not come between my Lord and his servant.
Farewell.
We will meet again in his presence.
Your blessing, Father.
First allow me to bestow holy orders on you.
Prepare yourself, my son.
Behold him whose ministry -
- No!
I am not worthy.
Holy orders, no!
Behold him whose ministry is offered you.
I am unfit to receive such grace.
I, an unworthy sinner.
Ascend your Calvary, Simon.
May peace be with you.
Brother Simon.
Let us pray.
Our Father, who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come... thy will be done... on earth as it is in heaven.
O blessed one!
Look at these stumps that once were hands.
Every day we grow poorer, and my daughters go hungry.
How did this misfortune befall you?
They were chopped off.
But why?
For stealing.
It's true.
But I am repentant.
Father, relieve my suffering.
Help us.
Have pity on these children.
I can only pray.
Pray with me in silence.
Perhaps God will allow us to witness one of Simon's miracles.
Amen.
You are whole.
Give thanks to the Lord and go about your business.
Fabiola, let's go home.
The garden needs digging.
- We'll have to buy a new hoe.
The old one is broken.
Let's go, girls.
Are these the same hands you had before, Father?
Be quiet, foolish girl.
Leave me be.
- See that?
- What?
- That thing with the hands.
- Oh, that.
Any bread left?
- Yes.
Give me a bit.
We've spent long enough on these spiritual shenanigans.
Shall we go, Father?
We must accompany Simon's solitude a while in prayer.
Where did that one-eyed woman come from?
One-eyed?
You're mistaken, Simon.
She has one eye, I tell you.
She has two eyes, both healthy.
- How do you know?
- Because I looked.
And there was nothing wrong with either eye.
How could you forget the commandments that say,
“Lay not thine eyes upon woman,” and “Be thou not seduced by a woman's gaze,” and especially...
“Be thou not burned in the fire of vain contemplation”?
My brother,
I pray you not to come here again until your gaze regains its due moderation.
Good day, Brother Matthew
God be with you, brother.
Where's the milk for the monastery?
Some whore breathed on it and curdled it.
At the crack of dawn,
I'll bring a fresh jugful.
Have you come to visit our blessed Simon?
Yesterday I took him a bowl of curd and a piece of soft bread.
And curse my soul, the so-and-so paid me no heed.
Don't curse.
Forgive Father Simon.
He must have been praying.
What's wrong with her?
She's got a bad foot.
You like her, don't you?
Her name's Domitila.
Look what a pair of beauties.
You just touch them, and they firm up.
Abide with God, brother.
Don't love those animals so.
The devil roams this wilderness.
I hear him in the night.
Avert thy wrath.
They could not...
my heart.--
O my Lord -
I can't remember how it ends.
My heart -
Here I am!
I've brought your food,
0 blessed one.
May the peace of God be with you.
- And with you, brother.
I've brought oil and bread as well as your lettuce.
My body doesn't need those delicacies.
It is sufficiently nourished with the lettuce God gives me.
I'm fasting too, Father.
But the problem is, the less I eat, the fatter I get.
The abbot wants you to eat more.
Thank him for his concern, but ask his forgiveness.
I know better than he how necessary it is for me to fast.
I ask your forgiveness as well.
Things have changed a lot in the abbey.
They no longer give us wine.
Our water has cumin and pepper in it.
The abbot says it makes you strong.
What have you been eating these last five days?
You've hardly drunk any water.
And what's left smells awful.
Do you need anything else, Father?
Go in peace.
Let me fight my battle.
Battle?
An innocent like you knows nothing of these things.
My son.
You look very clean.
Thank you, Father
But remember that cleanliness in body and clothing, innocent enough in ordinary men, is a sin in those who dedicate their lives to God.
If you say so, Father.
I'll keep it in mind.
In righteousness
shalt thou be worshipped.
He's an idiot, the conceited ass!
In righteousness -
Man is the most despicable of all thy creatures, Lord.
His very presence distances me from thee.
My help cometh even from the Lord.
Funny, there are no flies today.
I'm hungry and thirsty once again.
I'd managed to forget my body,
but that wretch made me remember.
No! I'll eat nothing until sunset'.
How long before I am worthy of thee?
How greatly tempted
I am to descend
and feel mother earth under my feet.
And run, and run...
Not so fast.
Do you ever think of me, my son?
Hardly ever, Mother.
I don't have time.
Why are you so proud, my son?
Proud of my freedom.
Or of my enslavement, Mother.
Here I am, Simon!
Watch this!
Cease from thy folly
Count as lost
That which has perished
Thou alone
Above all the hirsute
Thou, son of rabbit-ridden Syria
You good man, Simeon
With the lovely thick beard
And teeth brushed clean
With Syria's urine
- What are you doing here?
- Playing.
- Where did you come from?
- Over there.
- And where are you going?
- Over there.
Who are you?
I'm an innocent little girl, Simon.
Look what innocent legs I've got.
In m y kingdom, Simeon
Neither is everyone what they seem
Nor do they seem
What they are
What a lovely beard
And teeth brushed clean
With Syria's urine
Look how long my tongue is.
I fear you not, Satan.
O Christ!
I'll be back, shaggy locks!
O heavenly father
And Christ our savior
I give praise to you
at the setting sun
To Father, Son and Holy Ghost
It is right thou should be praised
By the holy Voices
Of the Son of God
For the Lord said,
“Whosoever abandons father, mother, brothers, sisters, wife, children and property and follows me shall be repaid a hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life.”
In the world, I was a mere slave.
And here I am ready to serve you.
For it is written,
“God helps those who help others.”
Let us not yield in our asceticism
Let us spread it like an arc.
Let us leave our past behind and ascend ever onwards and upwards to follow the eternal calling of the heavenly voices.
Offer your food and raiment to the poor and hungry, for they will open to you the doors to the Kingdom of Heaven.
Our time on earth is short.
Look, brothers!
The saint's got a pretty full larder.
Cheese.
Bread.
And wine!
He who poses as the champion of penance on a column to be above ordinary men...
Samaritan!
Is guided by the hand of Satan.
You've seen the proof.
“Let us not yield in our asceticism
Spread it like an arc.”
I put my trust in you, Simon.
This food can only be sent by the devil to tempt you.
I need no explanation, brother.
But tell these, your disciples, if you know why these provisions were in your bag.
More welcome is slander to the pious soul than odious eulogies that arouse pride.
This gentle one, this humble one, calls me a slanderer, brothers.
I swear before God that I did not place these tasty morsels there.
O blessed one, give us but one word and we will believe you.
Speak.
I am thy servant, Lord.
Thy will be done.
You see?
He shrinks from a reply.
No one can doubt his guilt now.
Let us pray for him, brothers.
One servant of the Lord accuses another, and we who came here to be uplifted find only scandal.
Let us lift up our prayers to the Holy Ghost.
May he show us the guilty one.
Let us kneel and pray.
In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
What's the matter?
Cross yourself, Brother Trifón.
You filthy eunuch!
Yes, I put the food in your bag.
And I haven't finished tormenting you yet, son of a whore.
I won't rest until I hear your own filthy lips cursing Christ in the holy sacrament and his so-called mother.
In the belly of the whore.
The Lord shall avenge me.
Down with the sacred hypostasis!
Long live the sacred hypostasis!
- Death to the anastasis!
- Long may it live!
- Long live the apocatastasis!
- Down with it!
What on earth is the apocatastasis?
Hear me, O Lord.
Death to Jesus Christ!
Death to -
Long may he live!
The Lord loveth the righteous.
I exorcise you in the name of Christ.
Flee the body of that man!
Flee, Satan, at the sign of this cross.
Pick him up and take him away.
I'll finish exorcising him at the monastery in my own way.
Peace be with you, brother.
Zenón!
Listen to me.
Send that beardless youth away.
Me?
It is not fitting for him to live near the temptations of the devil.
Tell him not to return until his beard covers his cheeks.
Thank you for your advice, fruit of your sound judgment.
You may leave the monastery to return home, Matias.
When your face is covered with hair, you may return.
Don't love those old graybeards so.
The devil roams this wilderness.
I hear him in the night.
0 God,
my God,
from the dawn
I keep watch for thee-
My soul thirsteth for thee,
and my ﬂesh too, in all manner of ways.
O Lord.
Lord, my thoughts stray from thee.
Receive, Lord, thy most humble of servants.
You are my favorite son, Simon.
Your asceticism is sublime.
I love you and live in you.
You speak for me.
For eight years, eight months and eight days, your spirit has burned atop that column as the flame burns atop a candle.
Blessed are those who suffer.
I want to die in thee, Lord.
Deign to receive my soul.
Why criest thou, Lord?
I cry for you, my beloved son.
I am saddened by your penance and by your excessive sacrifice.
Cease them now if you would please me.
Change your ways.
Change, Lord?
Come down off that column.
Taste earthly pleasures till you've had your fill.
Till the very word pleasure fills you with nausea.
Only then will you be truly close to me.
Satan! I fear you not.
The Lord will render useless all your intrigues.
How long will you go on seeking mankind's undoing?
You who before your fall rejoiced in the divine presence.
If I repent, Simon, would God restore me to my former glory?
On no account, Satan.
Repent if you can, but you'll remain like this for all of time.
Just look what a filthy cheat
I'm rubbing shoulders with!
You know where you can stuff an offer like that!
I'm quite happy as I am, you swine!
Slimy sacrament in the belly of a whore!
I beseech you in the name of Christ, let a just man pray in peace.
I'll be back, shaggy locks!
If I don't free myself from the devil today, Lord,
I'll break free tomorrow.
Or in five years, or ten.
Self-restraint, prayer, charity and humility will be my weapons.
My eyes must have been blind to have mistaken the wolf for the lamb.
I deserve eternal penance.
Until thou callest me to thy side,
I'll use one leg only to support my body.
I thank thee, Lord, for providing my sustenance.
Make fertile the soil that feeds the poor, and let hail not fall.
I bless you, poor innocent creature.
Go and sing the glories of the Lord.
Who can I bless now?
Besides being a spiritual exercise, blessings are good fun too.
And I don't offend anyone.
What am I saying?
I'm beginning to realize
I don't realize what I'm saying.
What am I saying?
Father!
Bless Pelagia's pregnancy.
Let's see if the bitch drops what she's carrying.
You too have my blessing, brother, you who are poor in spirit and worldly goods.
Don't bless me in the same breath as my goats!
But I respect you and love you, and tomorrow I'll bring you a bowl of fresh milk.
Thank you, my son.
But you know it's no use.
I've got a feeling he's not quite right in the head.
It must come from stuffing yourself with air.
Believe me, I eat and drink quite enough to fulfill my needs.
I'm not a spirit or disincarnate, but a man whose flesh weighs heavily upon him.
As for the need to evacuate my bowels, my excrement is like your goats' because I'm so withered up.
The only thing I understood of all that was “withered up.”
What do you want?
I want your forgiveness and your blessing.
Who are you?
Why must I forgive you?
I was the one who gazed upon a woman.
God has already forgiven you.
I'd like to give you some rather unsavory news about God's servants.
The hordes of the Antichrist are advancing on Rome.
They'll be here before long.
Blessed is the scourge if it wins us glory before the Lord.
Mankind will forever be entwined in fratricidal conflict, and all because of that cursed “yours” and “mine.”
What do you mean?
Man kills to defend what he considers his.
I don't understand.
What is “yours” and “mine”?
Look.
I'll explain.
This is your bag, isn't it?
If I say it's not, we'll start to quarrel.
Let's try it.
Simon, this bag is mine.
Now, you say it's yours.
- It's mine.
- No, it's mine.
All right, take it then.
Your unselfishness is admirable and very good for your soul.
But I fear that, like your penance, it is of little use to man.
I don't understand you.
We speak in different tongues.
Go in peace, brother.
Protect me, Lord!
I promised I'd return.
This is the last time.
Get thee behind me, Satan!
Not behind, nor anywhere else.
Abominable lord of darkness!
If the Lord has sent you to tempt me, so be it, but you will not succeed.
You disgust me. I can smell your foul breath from here.
You don't smell too good either.
Prepare yourself, Simon.
We're going on a long, long journey.
In the name of Christ.
Making gestures with your hand won't help you this time.
Simon of the desert, you may not believe it, but you and I are very much alike.
Like you,
I believe in God the Father Almighty, because I've been in his presence.
As for his only Son,
I could tell you a thing or two.
I believe in God almighty -
Get ready to leave, Simon.
I'm taking you to the sabbath.
There you'll see tongues of flame and the gaping red wounds of the flesh.
Enough!
Let's go.
They're coming for us.
What are you thinking about, Simon?
Nothing.
What's this dance called?
“Radioactive flesh.”
It's the latest dance, the final dance.
- Get thee behind me.
- Get thee gone.
Have fun.
I'm going home.
Better not.
You'll get a nasty surprise.
What is it?
Another tenant's moved in.
You'll have to stick it out.
You'll have to stick it out till the end.
THIS IS A MEXICAN FILM
MADE BY MEMBERS OF THE S.T.P.C.
Wednesday, April 16th 1746.
This is the advance battalion
of an English Government army of 9,000 men.
Their objective: Culloden Moor,
four and a half miles southeast of the Highland town of Inverness.
Their purpose: the destruction of the
Highland Jacobite army of rebellion,
a tired, ill-administered force of less than 5,000 men
who wait just beyond the top of this ridge.
Sir Thomas Sheridan,
Jacobite military secretary.
Suffering advanced debility and loss of memory.
Former military engagement
56 years ago.
Sir John MacDonald,
Jacobite captain of cavalry.
Aged, frequently intoxicated,
"described as " a man of the most limited capacities.“
John William O'Sullivan,
Jacobite quartermaster general.
"Described as " an Irishman whose vanity is superseded
only by his lack of wisdom."
Prince Charles Edward Stuart,
Jacobite commander in chief.
Former military experience:
10 days at a siege at the age of 13.
You must understand, without putting too fine a point on it, that the army here is in a total shambles.
I've got half my company missing.
I just can't find them.
They've gone off somewhere to sleep.
Your Royal Highness,
why exactly are Mr Sheridan,
Sir John MacDonald and Mr O'Sullivan
handling the administration of your army?
Because I chose them.
I consider those gentlemen to be utterly trustworthy and competent.
The first thing my men will find when they do awake is the enemy on them, cutting their throats.
James MacDonald, taxman.
Senior officer in a ruthless clan system,
who's brought with him on to the moor
men whose land he controls.
Alistair McVurrich, subtenant of a taxman.
Owns one eighth of an acre of soggy ground and two cows.
Alan MacColl, subtenant of a subtenant.
Owns half-share in a small potato patch measuring 30 feet.
Angus MacDonald, servant of a subtenant.
He owns nothing.
Lowest in the clan structure, he is called a “cotter.“
This man is totally dependent on the men above him in the clan system.
They, in their tum, on the taxman.
They, in their tum, on this one man,
the man who has brought them all onto the moor.
Alexander MacDonald, called, in Gaelic, MacDhomhnuill,
chief of the MacDonald's of Keppoch.
The owner of all his tenants' land,
the rem he has charged them is to fight with him as clan warriors
whenever he decrees.
This is the system of the Highland clan: human rent.
I hold my land from MacCruachan, as my father did, by bringing him 20 fighting men from amongst my tenants.
These I have brought.
To this man, who is rent, today's battle is a matter of honour.
I fight today because it is an honour to be with my chief, MacDhomhnuill, and because my father fought beside his father.
To this man, who is rem, the battle is a matter of revenge.
I fight first for MacDhomhnuill, then for Charlie.
Then because the Campbells, who did steal my cows, are with the enemy.
I have also raised over 100 men from Rannoch.
Some were unwilling.
With these, I used force.
Alistair McVurrich, told by his taxman that if he did not fight
he would have his cattle taken and his roof burnt.
This is the system of the clan,
a system that has brought on to the moor over 4,000 men,
men from Argyll and Inverness, from Moidart, Appin and the isles,
Catholics, Episcopalians,
Presbyterians,
the MacDonalds, the MacLeans, the Chisholms, the Camerons,
the Farquharsons, the Frasers, men of 14 major Highland clans.
Men like this.
Donald Cameron of Loch Eil,
chief of the powerful clan Cameron,
fearing for the survival of the ancient and ruthless society
to which he belongs.
Because he is here on the moor, most of the other chiefs are here.
Because he is here, Keppoch is here.
Because I feel that the Act of Union with England is a betrayal.
Because Prince Charles is a Catholic and I am a Catholic.
And the king in London is a Protestant.
Because Charles is part Scot and I am a Scot.
And the king in London is a German.
Prince Charles Edward Stuart,
the centre of all these men's hopes, himself half-Polish.
Age 25 and four months,
son of the exiled
James the Pretender,
he landed in Scotland nine months ago,
raised the clan army on a Highland surge of nationalism,
marched to Derby and came within an ace of toppling the Hanoverian dynasty
and regaining the throne for his father.
Though since forced to retreat back into the Highlands
and despite all evidence to the contrary,
Charles remains supremely confident
both of victory and his welcome by the English people.
King George ll is both a usurper and a tyrant.
He's kept my father's crown by enslaving all the people of this island.
He's deemed unpopular and I know that once victory is mine the people of England will welcome me.
Lord George Murray, age 51.
Lieutenant General in the clan army.
As their commanding officer,
this man forged the undisciplined Highlanders
into an army that not only almost reached London
but that also twice reduced superior English forces
into a panic-stricken rout,
first at Prestonpans, then at Falkirk.
Blunt, imperious, this man has bitterly quarreled with Charles
over the chaos in the army administration
and over the choice of this battlefield,
chosen by John William O'Sullivan.
Flat, treeless, devoid of shelter,
ideal for the employment by the British army
of its cannon and cavalry.
And from behind the shelter of these walls,
which O'Sullivan has refused to pull down,
Lord George Murray also fears both crossfire and outflanking.
Mr O'Sullivan,
in view of what Lord George feels about the battlefield,
have you inspected the ground yourself?
- No, I have not.
- Why not?
Because I don't deem it necessary.
It is a large, plain moor and, as such, it's a fair field for the enemy horse and cannon against which the
Highlanders will be defenceless.
I have informed His Royal Highness that it is a good field which I believe it to be.
I have told the Prince
I do not like it.
Your Highness, why are you fighting today,
when the ground here has been criticized by some of your officers?
Because God is on our side and I am convinced that my duty to my people lies in fighting today.
It's my opinion that the choice of the field for us is suicidal.
9,000 men, 16 battalions of infantry,
12 squadrons of cavalry,
8 companies of militia,
220,000 rounds of musket ammunition,
10 three-pounder battalion cannons,
800 three-pound cannonballs,
500 bags of cannon grapeshot.
This man's name is Fraser.
A deserter from the Government army, he still wears its uniform
but now stands in the ranks of the Prince's army,
amongst the men of his own clan and name.
He knows that, if he is captured as a deserter,
he will be immediately court-martialled to a sentence of death by throttling.
These are the Wild Geese,
150 exiled Irishmen
sewing in the army of His Most Christian Majesty,
Louis XV of France, the most powerful ally of the Stuart cause.
Brigadier General Walter Stapleton,
commander, Irish pickets of the French army.
Yes, we're here because
Prince Charles is a Catholic.
It will be a fine thing for all Catholics when Charlie's on the throne and German George is off it.
If we had a Catholic king on the throne in this country, then we could get back to living in our own.
You must remember that your Protestant king in London is passing penal laws against the Catholics in Ireland.
I'm from County Tipperary.
Now I've got to live in Boulogne.
You won't find a Catholic Irishman with much cause to love George ll.
William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, third son of King George ll.
Age 25 and one day.
Commander in chief of the Government army in Scotland.
Salary £15,000 per year.
Alexander Laing, private.
Salary sixpence a day.
Patrick McColman, three days ago a sergeant,
two days ago 800 lashes for looting, today a private.
John Mallaby, private.
Pressed into service.
William Roach, private.
Two years of his pay would not buy even the wig and hat
of the officer marching in from of him.
Joshua Ward, lieutenant, British army,
a fraternity where the least pretension to learning, to piety or to common morals
would endanger the owner to be cashiered.
I will now pass... in the middle of the second line.
Your Highness.
Give me a battery in the centre of the front line.
Alexander Laing carries a .753 musket,
firing a ball of one ounce and a third weight
an effective distance of 60 paces.
He carries sufficient ball, paper and black powder for 24 cartridges.
He carries at his hip a brass-hiked sword
and a bayonet with 18 inches of ﬂuted steel.
Alistair McVurrich carries in his right hand
an outdated dragoon pistol
for which he has no further ammunition.
What's the gun you're sewing?
It's a three-pounder.
Right now, it's downright useless.
Why's that?
We've only got 4 lb ammunition for it.
I tell you, it's chaos.
Half the ammunition's with the food.
That's still back in Inverness.
I haven't eaten for...
I don't know how long.
Ah, well now... that really is not my responsibility.
But, Mr O'Sullivan, you are the quartermaster general
and, as such, surely you're responsible for the distribution of food.
In normal circumstances, yes but now, as I am much pressed by other affairs,
I have given that responsibility to someone else.
When was the last time you ate?
Two days ago.
The day before yesterday.
This morning he killed a pig but wasn't allowed time to eat it.
I can't remember.
Andrew Henderson, Whig historian, biographer of Cumberland,
eyewitness of the Battle of Culloden.
The time is 12:15.
Now this wall, behind which we're sheltering, is at approximately right angles to the rebel lines.
I've drawn a rough sketch map here.
The rebel lines are here.
We are here.
And the Duke of Cumberland's army is here.
9,000 men in 16 infantry battalions
three of which are themselves Scot,
a total of 1,300 regular soldiers from the Lowlands,
plus, in reserve, the volunteer militias
of Stirling, Edinburgh,
Dumfries and Glasgow,
a further 8,000 men.
Charles Edward Stuart,
regent claimant to the thrones of England and Scotland,
has more Scots-in-arms against him than for him.
And, ranged against him in the Highlands,
he has the Whig clans siding with the Government,
the Munros, the Rosses, the MacKenzies,
the McLeods of Skye, the Sutherlands,
and here on the moor, the Campbells of the Argyll militia.
Here to fight Charles and his rebellion, here to take clan revenge,
Angus Ian Campbell,
wife murdered by the MacDonalds.
Alistair MacDonald, brother killed by Campbells in a cattle raid.
For him, loyalties to Charlie mean little.
For him, today's battle is a clan battle.
The swords those bastards use can cut a man in half.
Well, I reckon we'll have them this time.
- Why do you say that?
- We've got a new bayonet drill, see.
You don't poke at the man in front of you.
You poke at the man coming at your chum on the right.
That means, as he's lifting his sword arm, you get him underneath, like.
What do you think about the rebels?
Well... I ain't taken me clothes off for six weeks.
I reckon till we lay them bastards out I won't, neither.
I'll tell you one thing.
I know a lot of the boys make fun of our Billy Cumberland but I reckon he's all right.
He's a tough bastard but at least he feeds you which is more than some of them do.
I've heard said the rebels want to cut him as small as herbs for the pot.
Well... I don't reckon that.
They're a lot of friggin' savages.
Donald Gram, a farmer,
forced a month ago into the Highland army,
twice has deserted back to farm and family,
twice has been captured and forced to return.
Euan MacDonald, farmer,
forced into the Highland army the day before yesterday.
With him his son,
John Angus MacDonald,
the day before yesterday a ploughboy,
today a rebel in arms.
His age, 13.
I can't just make out what's happening in the rebel lines.
There's much confusion of movement.
Large numbers of men are moving about, changing their position... and there are large gaps in the centre.
It seems to me as though the entire line is completely askew.
Why is this?
We are all MacDonalds and, as such, we are entitled to stand on the right in the line of battle.
This is an ancient
MacDonald privilege and yet Mr O'Sullivan has thought fit to place
Lord George Murray's men in that position.
The main reason is that yesterday the Prince had an idea for a surprise march by night on the camp of Cumberland.
This we attempted. It failed.
But it meant that we were all up marching the entire night.
Consequently, the men are exhausted and are still stumbling into their positions.
What effect has this had on your men?
Look at them.
When did you last sleep?
As far as I am concerned, we are now putting an end to a bad affair.
The Scots are fair fighters until a crisis is reached and it's my opinion we've now reached that crisis.
With all these things amiss in our army, it would have been better had the
Prince made some plan for retreat.
Bu! Charles has made no plans for retreat.
He says that only those who are afraid can doubt his coming victory.
He puts from his mind the discontent of the MacDonalds,
the fatigue and hunger of his men,
the total outnumbering of his army,
the thinning of ranks by desertion,
the ill choice of battlefield,
convinced as he is of the invincibility of his men.
God is on our side.
Our cause is just and we will triumph this day.
The soldiers in the Elector's army know me to be their lawful Prince.
And so I'm convinced they'll break in panic, for they will never dare fight me.
Battalion, fix your bayonets.
Fix.
This man's name is Chisholm,
James Chisholm.
A private in the Government army, he is also a Highland Scot.
This man's name too is Chisholm,
Roderick Og Chisholm.
Fifth son of the clan chief,
he stands before his men in the Prince's army.
The Chisholm 500 yards away is this man's brother.
Charles Edward Stuart's war is a civil war.
They've started.
The rebel cannon have opened fire.
The cannon have opened from the rebels' centre and they're over-elevated.
Fire!
Batteries... from open sights... at will... fire!
Pull!
Fire!
Fire!
That's the Duke of Cumberland's cannons.
Cannonades all around me!
I'm going to have to shout to make myself heard!
The smoke is beginning to thicken.
It's going to be very difficult to see what effect our cannon is having on the rebel lines.
A cast-iron ball of three pounds' weight, fired from open sights.
This is roundshot.
This is what it does.
Pull!
Alistair McInnes, age 20.
Right leg severed below knee joint.
Malcolm Angus Chisholm, age 24.
Disembowelled.
Ian MacDonald, age 13. Shot.
1:12.
Dazed, indecisive, Charles has moved to behind
the right ﬂank of the Jacobite lines
and is now unable to see what is happening to his army.
Ordered by O'Sullivan to stand in the ranks six-deep,
the men on the Highland right
make a clear and tight-packed target for the English gunners.
Pull!
The rebels' artillery have stopped firing altogether and, before they did, we counted...
How many?
We counted 15 to 20 shots fired by our artillery for every one fired by the rebels.
1:17.
The second result of
O'Sullivan's administration.
The Prince's artillery, iii-fed by a sporadic ammunition supply,
ill-served by untrained amateurs,
ceases fire.
Pull!
Have you had orders to attack, sir?
- No, I've had none!
- Well, why not?
The Prince hasn't given any!
If he doesn't give them soon, he'll lose the entire army!
We're being shelled to pieces!
Pull!
Reload!
Pull!
Reload!
- What's the Prince doing?
- I don't know!
Nobody knows what he's doing!
1:22. Prince Charles Stuart, paralyzed with indecision,
still has given no order, either to advance or to retreat.
1:22. Clan Cameron,
200 men, shot to pieces.
Clan Stewart,
180 men, shot to pieces.
This is fantastic!
If this keeps up much longer, our gunners will have finished the whole affair.
The cannonade... The cannonade has given our men infinite spirits.
Clan Chisholm casualties,
47 killed or maimed.
This is incredible! Those men have been standing there for 22 minutes!
They're just lining the ranks!
The rebels are being literally blown apart!
Why are they standing there?
Why in God's name don't they run?
1:30. Still no order to advance.
Clan army casualties,
700 dead or maimed.
Charles Stuart hopes that by not advancing
he will tempt the Government army out of its battle lines to attack him.
1:32 pm. Cumberland orders a move
but not the one his cousin is expecting.
I want Wolfe's battalion to advance inside on the left!
Your Highness!
At 1:32, Cumberland places a battalion
behind one of the walls
O'Sullivan has refused to pull down,
to fire into the side of the clan army
when it charges the Government front.
This is the crossfire
O'Sullivan said would never happen.
Oh, yes, yes... Units of the Argyll... the Campbell-Argyll militia, yes?
And there are squadrons of dragoons with them.
Yes, it's obvious that
His Royal Highness has decided to have units of the Campbell-Argyll militia and some squadrons of dragoons to go down behind the south side of this wall, out of sight of the enemy, to take them in the rear and outflank the rebels.
Thus, also at 1:32 pm,
begins the outﬂanking movement
that O'Sullivan said would never happen.
29 minutes too late,
Charles Stuart orders an advance
along the entire from of the Jacobite army.
And you make the right side advance!
Bu! The message fails to reach the right wing.
Casualties, 850.
Have you still had no orders to attack?
No! I've had no orders!
I had a message from Mr O'Sullivan, which, as ever,
I failed to comprehend!
- The line's broken up!
- What?
They're charging, they're coming straight at us!
Sir, the right has broken forward!
The walls will hold them.
- They're going straight!
- Get down behing the wall there!
After 28 minutes of cannonfire!
What sort of men are these?
- Right! Change from ball to grape.
- Change from ball to grape!
A cylindrical canvas bag eight inches in length,
packed with musketballs and pieces of jagged iron.
This is grapeshot.
This is what it does.
Pull!
Pull!
It must be the grape! The centre has collided with the right.
There's great confusion, bodies flying!
They must be going to receive fire from our centre battalions!
Charge! Charge!
Fire!
Bastards!
God, they're almost upon us!
They're firing from this side and from this side.
They're been cut to pieces!
It must be chaos behind those walls!
Chaos!
Barrell's!
Towards this one regiment,
Barrell's Fourth of Foot,
heads the entire right of the clan army,
800 men in a solid clump,
running with a collision speed of over 12 miles an hour.
Alternate... firing!
Battalion, take care.
Fall in by rank. Take aim!
Rear rank, present!
Rear rank, fire!
Fire!
Front rank, take aim!
Front rank, fire!
Rear rank, present.
Fire!
Centre rank, present.
Front rank, present.
Remember, Barrell's, off to the right!
They've broken through Barrell's!
General Huske, advance Bligh's and Semphill's, support on the left.
Your Highness.
1:57 and the Duke of Cumberland sees the men of his second line,
placed there for just such an emergency, fire with crippling effect
into the Highlanders who broke through the from line.
1:57. Charles Stuart, who has made no battle plan at all,
sees, on the right wing, his men run from this concentrated musketfire
and sees, on his left wing,
the MacDonalds, tired, hungry,
rebellious at not being given their rightful battle position by O'Sullivan,
hold back from charging the royal army right.
Instead, they stand and taunt,
trying to tempt the royal army lines forward in disorder.
Battalion Pulteney's, make ready!
They're stopping to pick up stones!
Shoot!
1:58. The MacDonalds, dismayed at the sight of the advancing cavalry,
themselves draw back.
Keppoch, one of their leaders,
runs forward with other clan officers to encourage them
and is shot through twice by musketball.
About him, his men tum and run.
Time 1:59 pm.
The rout of the Highland army begins.
Christ, they're running.
They're leaving the field except for two small units, the French and the Irish.
Let them through. Stand your ground.
Guard, forward!
Oh, Jesus!
Front rank, present. Fire!
Re-form! Re-form!
Stand and aim! Fire!
Walter Stapleton, commander, Irish pickets,
cut down with 100 of his men
as the Scots about them run.
Where are you going, you?
Charles Stuart tries to rally his men.
"Pray stand with me, your Prince," he cries.
"Pray stand with me but a moment, otherwise you ruin me,
"your country and yourselves and God forgive you.“".
But it is too late.
At one minute past two in the afternoon,
his cause in ruins,
Charles Edward Stuart is led from the battlefield
by the man most responsible for his defeat.
As Charles leaves, a senior clan officer screams after him,
"Run, you cowardly Italian."
- Mr Fossett.
- Your Highness?
- You will order a general ceasefire.
- Your Highness.
Of the 9,000 men of the royal army
who advanced this morning from Naim with Private Laing,
an estimated 50 are dead.
Bu! For every one corpse in the royal army
there are 24 in the clan army.
Piled in layers, dead or dying,
are 1,200 men...
including the brother of Private James Chisholm.
There was scarce a soldier or officer of Barrell's Fourth of Foot
who did not kill one or two men each with their bayonets or spontoons.
Not a bayonet but was bent and stained with blood
to the muzzles of their muskets.
All witnesses agreed that, if grapeshot were the king of battles,
the bayonet was now the queen of weapons.
"It is mine and everybody': opinion," boasts a trooper,
"that no history can brag of so singular a victory."
How do you feel?
Don't feel nothing, really.
I feel all right!
Well, now it's over.
Battalion, take care!
Halt!
2:14pm. The battalions of Cumberland
halt at the lines held by the rebels one hour and eight minutes ago.
Battalion, shoulder your firelocks!
Three cheers for His Royal Highness!
- Hip, hip!
- Hurrah!
Thus has ended the last battle to be fought in Britain
and the last armed attempt to overthrow its king.
The Establishment has been saved, peace restored,
Church, Crown, trade and commerce safeguarded.
Thus the Duke of Cumberland won his only victory
and Charles suffered his only defeat.
His advisers are shortly to urge his instructions for reassembly.
"He is to reply, " Do as you wish.
Only, for God's sake, let us go.“
Charles Edward Stuart, his cause now in ruins,
has given one order too many.
Charles pitted these men against the modem musket and bayonet,
against cavalry and cannon.
Thus, in one hour, eight minutes,
he has reduced the ﬂower of the Highland clans
to twitching, limbless corpses.
2:30 pm and His Royal Highness, the Duke of Cumberland,
orders rum and brandy, cheese and biscuits for his “brave boys.“
For the wounded and dying clansmen on the moor,
there is to be different treatment.
All over the battlefield, whilst the
Duke of Cumberland eats his lunch,
any clansmen seen to be still alive
is either slit in the throat, pistolled through the head
or bayonetted and trampled on until, in the words of an eyewitness,
"the moor was covered with blood"
"and our British soldiers looked less like Christian men"
"than so many butchers."
What about some grub?
This rebel host has been most deeply indebted to the public for all the rapine, murder and cruelty and our men are heartily determined to give them receipt in full.
Cut him!
Cut him, you bastard!
Take him to the shoulder!
I'm letting my regiments of horse loose after the battle in order they may have some sweets with all their fatigue.
Thus nearly 100 people are to be butchered or maimed
on the road to Inverness.
Butchered whether or not they took any part in the battle.
They took my baby.
He's only two weeks old.
And one of them whirled him around by his leg... and threw him on to the ground.
This is Jean Clark, aged 28.
Cut about the face and body by sabres,
she was left lying for dead on the road to Inverness.
The soldiers came in and caught him, and Daddy too but I got away through a hole in the wall.
- How old was your brother?
- Lachlan was nine.
I don't... I don't know where he and Daddy are now.
Come on, you!
4 pm. Inverness.
James Rae: trooper,
Kingston's Light Horse,
the first man of Cumberland': army to enter the Highland capital,
the first man to show its inhabitants
what is to be expected from an Englishman
protecting his liberty and his Protestant religion.
There was these two men, shouting and screaming.
And then he came out and there was blood on his hands.
These troopers from the Duke of Kingston's Light Horse Regiment
are later to be commended by Cumberland
for their "zeal in the pursuit."
Each of them comes from Nottingham.
Each of them by trade is a butcher.
James Rae himself, who, like the other troopers of Kingston's Light Horse,
played his pan in the battle when it was over,
is later to return to Nottingham,
where his regimental colours are to be laid to rest
with great pomp and ceremony.
"To the perpetual fame and immortal memory
"of the Duke of Kingston's
Light Horse,
"where, amongst others, on the 16th day of April 1746,
"they performed many and glorious exploits
"in routing and entirely subduing the perfidious rebels.“".
"Long may the county of Nottingham ﬂourish."
"God save our ever august King."
April 16th. 10:30 pm. Inverness.
For William Augustus,
Duke of Cumberland,
third son of King George ll,
an evening of immense satisfaction and triumph.
At the age of 25, he has saved his father's kingdom
and redeemed the reputation of the British army.
At his table, older officers drink his toast and declare him to be
one of the greatest English captains since Marlborough.
His cousin Charles, until today the heroic leader of an armed rebellion,
is now a fugitive in the heather.
If further proof were needed of this young man's prowess,
it is here,
unheeded by him, four and a half miles away.
This is Lachlan MacDonald of Lochaber,
right leg severed below the knee joint.
He's been lying on the moor untended for 13 hours.
For most of the time, it has been raining.
This is Mrs Anne Hossack of Inverness.
Somewhere on the moor, amidst 1,200 dead and dying,
is her husband.
I don't know... where he is.
For Alexander Laing, private,
Barrell's Fourth Regiment of Foot,
this evening is also one of immense satisfaction.
His regiment has acquitted itself with honour on the field of battle.
He himself has despatched three of the rebels
and, above all, he himself has escaped death and maiming.
Lucky bastard!
Battalion will take care while the casualty lists are read.
It's all right for you, my lord!
This is Mrs Anne Walker,
wife of Private Andrew Walker, who was wounded in the ranks of Barrell's
and taken to the surgeons' lines.
This woman, also, has no idea whether her husband is alive or dead.
It is given out this morning of Thursday 17th April that the following officers and other ranks of Major General William Barrell's
Regiment of Foot were either killed or have since died from wounds resulting from the glorious victory inflicted yesterday over the rebel army.
Killed: Captain Lord Robert Kerr.
Other ranks: Sergeant Pullman,
Privates Baker, Barstow, Dyke,
Finch, Lowell,
Lawson, Meecham, Napper, Osbourne,
Smart, Williamson.
Wounded and since died in the surgeons' lines:
Corporal Lockhart,
Privates Davis, Pollock and Walker.
Battalion, take care.
Battalion will dismiss, save for the duty picket.
Battalion, dismiss.
You treated Private Walker a short while ago, Doctor?
Yes... Yes, I did.
What did he die of?
This one? He died of shock, if I remember correctly.
Why was that?
He was an amputee.
I had to take his arm off.
Do you know what... what is our young Billy's pleasure because we fought with such gallantry?
His Royal Highness thanks all ye officers and men for their gallant behaviour.
Get out of it! Leave off!
His Royal Highness releases all ye military prisoners who were this day in custody of the provost.
- Have you heard about the wounded?
- Well, yeh, some talk about it.
They're gonna pay 12 guineas out of the Duke's own purse for all those wounded in the battle.
For Lachlan MacDonald,
who's been now lying on the moor two days with a severed right leg,
there'll be no 12 guineas.
Orders for Friday 18th April 1746.
"A captain and 40 foot to march directly"
"and visit all the cottages"
"in the neighbourhood of the field of battle."
"The officers and men will take notice"
"that the public order of the rebels on the day of battle"
"was to give us no quarter."
Line up the bodies, men.
Come on, quick as you can.
There's another one over there.
The public orders of the rebels to give no mercy to the royal army
do not exist in any other form than a crude forgery
alleged to have been found on the field of battle.
All right, lad.
We're only taking you to hospital.
Bu! Whether he knows this public order is a forgery or not,
Cumberland makes it his excuse to authorize what now happens.
Battalion, present your firelock... at the man in front of you.
Fire!
The officer in charge of this execution squad
is himself a Scotsman.
Captain Scott, are many of the rebels being killed in this fashion?
As many as we can find.
I don't know how many men have been killed in this fashion.
I fear to think.
But just this morning I heard a Campbell officer saying that, in just one area, he himself saw 72 wounded rebels shot or clubbed on the head.
Yes, I saw what was done.
Did you agree with it?
No, of course I didn't.
I will always thank God that I had nothing to do with the black work.
You must try to remember that this is a most difficult problem.
I have talked much with officers from Lowland Scots regiments and they undoubtedly feel that these Highlanders are threatening their culture, their Protestant religion.
They're threatening to disrupt their peace and their commerce.
There's a great feeling of insecurity in the Lowlands.
These people still remember the Highland host.
They still remember the years of cattle thieves and murder, men coming down at night from the hills and extorting blackmail under pain of being robbed.
You see, the Highlander talks a different language.
He wears different clothes... and he undoubtedly has some uncouth and barbaric practices.
For all these reasons,
I think you'll find most Lowlanders hold the man from this part of the country in contempt and hatred.
Much more so even than the English do.
Why is your army treating the prisoners and the wounded like this?
Of yourself, it's been said you're keeping the prisoners in Inverness
without warmth, food and water.
And that you're even withholding medical dressings from them.
Surely this is against all bounds of humanity.
Look, I think the point somewhat eludes you.
These men are rebels and barbarians and as such are to be rated as cattle and treated as cattle.
Get that thing back out the way, please.
For three days and nights since the battle,
these men, many of them stripped of their clothes,
many of them dying from gaping wounds,
have been lying in cold attics and clamp cellars,
awaiting removal to the prison ships anchored in the firth.
The British army authorities
have withheld from them even medical dressings,
thus hoping to solve the acute lack of prison space
by ensuring the mortality rate remains high.
They get no food, no light,
no medical dressing.
Get their headgear while you're about it.
The belt here, too.
The smell in here is terrible.
This man next to me...
I think he's dead.
The way they are treating us, you'd think we were just animals.
Robert MacLean, salmon fisher.
To be tried without defence at an English trial,
of which he is able to understand not a word spoken.
His sentence, execution at York
by being hanged, drawn and quartered.
Check these shackles while you're about it.
Ranald MacDonald, farmer.
To wait in prison 14 months for a trial.
Then sentenced at Brampton to be pulled through its streets on a sled
and hanged, drawn and quartered.
Charles Edward Stuart, believing the Scots to have betrayed him,
refuses to listen to last-minute pleas
to stay and fight in the mountains.
Curtly and without a word of thanks he dismisses the Highland army.
In his saddlebags the last of the Jacobite funds,
which he has now decided to keep for himself,
his need, he estimates, being greater.
Alistair John Stewart,
to lie 10 days in prison, untended, with a broken leg.
To die on the 11th day of gangrene.
John William O'Sullivan, soon to be safely in Rome.
To tell King James of the good part he has played in the rising
and to promptly receive first a knighthood
and then a baronetcy.
Alexander Sutherland, never brought to trial.
Disposal unknown.
Lord George Murray,
who to the end blamed Prince Charles and his Irish administration
for the defeat at Culloden,
is soon to leave Scotland forever, forced to seek exile in Europe.
Prince Charles refuses to see him again and never forgives him,
blaming his opposition to his administration
for the downfall of the Stuart cause.
Bad day for us all, this.
Lord George Murray, estimated by some
as one of the most brilliant generals of the 18th century,
who, if left to his own counsel,
could perhaps have turned Culloden into a victory.
Keep in step, now!
May 23rd. The British army moves to Fort Augustus in the Great Glen.
From here, the centre link in a chain of forts and garrisons
stretching from Inverness in the east to Tobermory in the west,
from Bernera in the north to Dumbarton in the south,
the Duke of Cumberland mounts what he terms,
"the pacification of the Highlands."
Patrol of Bligh's, you will proceed on police action to Lochaber, with sufficient rations for two days.
All right, lads. Fall out and pick up your firelocks.
Move it!
Lord Sackville, what is the function of these patrols.
Their function is to march deep into the glens occupied by the rebels and their families and there, by vigorous police action, ensure that never again will these people disturb the peace of our land.
May 30th. A military patrol under Lord George Sackville
strikes deep into a corrie in Lochaber,
searching for fugitive rebel families.
This is one of them,
sheltering from the rain 1,500 feet up the side of a hill face.
Andrew McEachan, aged 25,
who stood at Culloden, and who now, because of the patrols,
has to hide in the hills like an animal.
This is his wife, child and a friend called Mrs MacInnis.
They have each been out in the open for the past eight days.
This girl is suffering from severe ﬂux
as a result of damp clothes.
The last meal this baby ate was a small fish caught yesterday
and shared between the children.
This little girl, forced to leave her home suddenly,
has only a thin dress, a damp shawl and no shoes.
At approximately 12 noon, May 30th,
the family is sighted by the patrol.
This is what happens.
Right, then!
NO! No!
I dunno.
All these officers keep telling us these people up here are a load of savages, but...
I dunno, they looked like ordinary women and children up there to me.
I didn't like it, what We did.
I didn't like it at all.
Look, let me tell you something.
I had a mate at Falkirk.
He had his head split open.
Like that.
So don't try and make me go all weeping, like, over what happens to these bastards. Eh?
Just don't try it!
Well satisfied with the result of his military occupation,
Cumberland is to leave
Scotland on July 18th.
He leaves behind him, to finish the destruction of the rebel clans,
not only an immense concentration of English and Lowland troops,
not only the zealous help of all the Whig clans,
but even the help of the chief of a rebel clan, Ludovick Grant,
son of the Gram clan chief,
who has hastily reorganized his loyalties
and just delivered 82 of his own rebel clansmen to Cumberland
for transportation to the Barbados,
as proof of his unswerving allegiance to the Crown.
Cumberland himself is to receive from London a tumultuous welcome.
From the Government, a raise in salary of £25,000.
From George Frederick Handel a choral work,
See The Conquering Hero Comes.
From the public, his name for a ﬂower, Sweet William.
From the Scots, his name for a weed, Stinking Billy.
Month after month, the British army patrols
scour every hill range and glen of northern Scotland
in an attempt, as Cumberland puts it,
"to wear down this generation until there be peace in the land.“".
The patrols leave behind them a trail of brutality and suffering
that is to earn for their commander undying loathing
and the epithet
Cumberland the Butcher.
These three of his officers have already burnt, smashed, raped,
looted and bayonetted their way from Glenurquhart to Moidart,
committing, in the name of pacification,
the worst atrocities in the history of the British army.
Captain Caroline Frederick Scott,
Lowlander.
I agree with the senior staff officer, who has proposed that £5 be paid for the head of every rebel brought to Fort Augustus.
Major lain Lockhart, Lowlander.
Those found in arms are ordered to be immediately put to death and the houses of those who abscond are plundered and burned, their cattle drove, their ploughs and other tackle destroyed.
Lord George Sackville, Englishman, third son of the Duke of Dorset.
We have detachments in all parts of the Highlands.
The people are deservedly in a most deplorable way and must perish, either by famine or by the sword.
A just reward for traitors.
We hang or shoot everyone that is known to conceal the Pretender, burn their houses, take their cattle.
The Pretender, Charles Edward Stuart,
object of the largest single manhunt in British history,
now disguised as an ordinary clansman,
much addicted to the little bottle he carries in his hip pocket,
suffering from dysentery,
is to spend the next five months
scrambling amidst the rocks and hills of the Western Highlands,
sheltered by its people, who remain loyal to him and never betray him,
until, in September, he takes a ship for France and security,
leaving behind him nothing,
nothing but a legend,
"Bonnie Prince Charlie."
My bonnie moorhen
My bonnie moorhen.
Up in the grey hill
Down in the glen.
Charles Edward Stuart, the “bonnie moorhen, “
is to walk out of the lives of the people he has led into so much suffering
with scarcely a backward look in their direction.
The year of the Prince had ended
but for the English Government, this was just the beginning.
Systematically and with clue parliamentary legislation,
they proceeded to eliminate ail the things that made this man unique
and that gave him the strength they so feared.
They penalized the wearing of his Highland dress,
penalized the weaving of his Highland tartan,
penalized the worshipping at his Church,
penalized the carrying of his weapons,
penalized the playing of his music.
They removed the authority of his chief
and, in one blow, smashed forever the system of his clan.
They then encouraged his chief to lose interest in him,
to evict him and to replace him by the more profitable sheep.
Thus they reduced him to a homeless, unwanted oddity
and finally forced him, in his hundreds of thousands,
to leave the land of his birth
for the canning industries of the North,
for the disease-ridden slums of the South,
for the lumber camps of Canada
and the stockyards of Australia.
And wherever he went,
he took with him his music, his poetry,
his language and his children.
"On an April morning.
"I no longer hear birdsongs
"or the lowing of cattle on the moor.
"I hear the noise of sheep and the English language,
"dogs barking and frightening the deer.“".
Thus, within a century from Culloden,
the English and the Scottish Lowlanders
had made secure forever
their religion, their commerce,
their culture, their ruling dynasty
and, in so doing, had destroyed a race of people.
They have created a desert
and have called it "peace."
My name is Elia Kazan.
I am a Greek by blood, a Turk by birth...
and an American, because my uncle made a journey.
This story was told me over the years by the old people in my family.
They remember Anatolia, the great central plateau of Turkey and Asia.
And they remember the mountain,
Erciyes, standing above the plain.
Anatolia was the ancient home of Greek and Armenian people.
But 500 odd years ago, the land was overrun by the Turks...
and from that day the Greeks and Armenians lived here...
but as minorities.
The Greek subject people.
The Armenian subject people.
They wore the same clothes as the Turks...
the fez and the sandal...
ate the same food, suffered the heat together...
used the donkey for burdens.
And they looked up to the same mountain...
but with different feelings...
for, in fact, they were conqueror...
and conquered.
The Turks had an army.
The Greeks and the Armenians lived as best they could.
But the day came, here in Anatolia, as everywhere there's oppression...
when people began to question.
There were bursts of violence, sudden and reckless.
People began to wonder, and some to search for another home.
You say in America they have mountains bigger than this?
In America, everything's bigger.
What else? What else in America?
What are we waiting for?
Come on you, let's go you, with the help of Jesus.
We better sell this ice before it melts.
The year is 1896.
A Turkish provincial governor has called...
an emergency meeting of his council.
Be seated, be seated, please.
Your glasses, Governor.
This came an hour ago, over the wire from the capital.
Your Excellency...
On this day, the eve of our national feast of Bayram...
Armenian fanatics have dared to set fire... to the National Turkish Bank in Constantinople.
It is the wish of our Sultan...
Abdul Hamid the Resplendent, the shadow of God on earth... that the Armenian subject people throughout his empire... be taught, once and for all, that acts of terror... cannot be tolerated.
Our Sultan has the patience of the Prophet... but he has now given signs that he would be pleased... if this lesson were impressed, once and for all... upon this dangerous minority.
How this is to be effected will be left to Their Excellencies... the governors of each province...
...and to the army post commanders stationed in each provincial capital.
Stop!
Stop!
Help yourself, sir, help yourself.
Jallal... bring something.
Sir, Your Honour... help yourself, sir, help yourself.
That's what he needs, encouragement.
But, Your Honour...
What do you want?
Not I, the ice, it's nature is to melt.
It does not consider we have to go all the way to the market to sell it.
In plain language, you want me to hurry?
If you would.
All right now?
You had too much of a load for this dear old horse.
Now, she'll get you to market more quickly, agreed?
Yes, sir, agreed.
Are you Armenian?
Greek, sir, Greek.
Where do you live?
Over that hill.
And you?
Down below.
- And you are?
- Armenian.
Armenian?
Did he have anything to do with burning the bank in Constantinople?
Why do you smile?
You are joking.
How could we have been there yesterday? It's two weeks' journey.
Even with this horse?
Captain Mahmed.
- How do you know my name?
- We served together 8 years ago.
That is, I served you, and you served your Sultan, Abdul Hamid... the shadow of God on earth.
I was your orderly, so naturally you've forgotten me.
Remember?
I stole chickens for you.
Vartan, you!
Vartan!
- I didn't recognise you.
- I know, but I'm Vartan.
Vartan, my little lamb, what happened to you?
Well, as you can see,
I'm trying to make a few coppers.
With this dear, dying stud.
Hey, come on, Jallal, put the ice back, quickly.
Hurry, before it melts.
Your people burn our buildings, and you expect us to say thank you?
No.
Today, no Armenian will be forgiven... for being an Armenian.
I beg you, stay up here with me.
But he has his mother and father down there and his little brother.
Then it is in the hands of God.
Vartan! Vartan!
Vartan!
- What's happened?
- They're in the church... mother, father, all our family, our people.
Father says come now.
I've got this ice to sell now.
Don't be seen with this Armenian,
Stavros, stay away from him.
I can't do that.
Your mother is looking for you.
Go home, quickly.
No one is on the streets.
I'm going to the Guitars.
What for?
For my satisfaction.
But the Turks drink there.
Here comes your mother.
Your father says don't work with that man!
You're not a child anymore!
Why do I have to take you by the ear like a child and drag you home?
Like a child!
Say something!
Answer me when I talk to you!
Stay away from that man!
He was with the Armenian again,
Isaac, your eldest.
You've given your father a terrible day of worry.
Kiss his hand and ask forgiveness.
He's too easy with you.
You're too easy with him, Isaac, if you'll forgive me.
It's not my place to say so, but...
Have you had dinner?
I'm not hungry.
Vasso, give him some food.
But, I'm not hungry.
You'll eat something.
Who is this Armenian?
Damadian's son, Vartan.
He doesn't know his place.
It's not our affair.
They're Armenians, we're Greeks, our necks aren't the same.
True. They're saving the Greeks for their next holiday.
- What did he say?
- We all heard what he said.
Where were you?
Father's been looking for you.
Just like a woman!
What's happening?
The jails are empty.
- Who are those two?
- I don't know.
The Armenian's going to dance.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
America...
America.
Let's go. If we don't go now, we'll never get another chance.
Armenians.
To the church.
The captain says come now.
- It's beginning!
- All Turks!
Where is your captain?
Have pity on us.
Have pity on us!
Vartan, Vartan, Vartan, they're inside!
Father, mother, everyone.
Do something!
Go back and tell them to come out and beg for mercy.
Go!
Mama, Papa, open the door.
Mama, open the door.
Come on, come on, open, open the door!
- Stavros! Stavros!
- No one leaves here.
- No one leaves this section.
- I'm taking him home.
Where's the Greek?
The Armenians started it.
It's always the Armenians.
Don't disturb us now, them first.
Every few years we have to teach the Armenians.
The Greeks are more peaceful.
You see, the patient man waits.
As the Prophet said... hatred exhausts itself.
It's no comfort for me that the Armenians started this.
I believe that some day, with Allah's help... all races will live together in peace, even the Armenians.
That's the hope of mankind.
They are bringing him, my friend, they are bringing your boy.
See?
A fine young man.
Now, smile.
Smile.
I am very grateful to you.
It's not only that I like you,
I like all the Greek subject people.
We all know that.
I'm here only for the good
I can do.
I make nothing here, you realise that.
And I do good.
I do help, don't you think?
Oh, yes.
We're all very grateful.
I was referring particularly to you, you have a good business here... the Turkish people like you, and you have a good business.
We make a living.
Hold him there a moment.
I happen to know you do very well and that makes me happy.
Very happy.
Come, my dear friend, join us.
Come, come.
Here, here.
To our friends everywhere.
Be grateful the governor is my friend...
That's the way it is here!
Stavros!
Stavros!
Grandmother!
Grandmother!
Grandmother!
I came to see you, Grandmother.
You don't look well.
How's that good Greek, your father?
You know why the fox loves the rabbit?
Because he hasn't any teeth.
How's your father?
Your grandfather was a man.
I was expecting you.
He told me you were coming.
Who?
Your grandfather.
He came he to see me last night.
I think he's found a new wife in the land of the dead.
Well... What can you do?
But he still comes to see me.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Why?
You're moving around like a criminal.
What do you want?
I just came to see you.
You're lying. I hope to God you're not going to be like your father.
Already you've got his smile.
What are you going to do?
All the men in our family lie.
The Turks spit in their face and they say it's raining.
Be honest.
Tell me what you came for.
Don't lie again. Your grandfather told me what you wanted.
What did he tell you I wanted?
Money. True?
True.
Why should I give you money?
What do you need it for?
You're an old woman.
Get out, you're just like your father! Get out!
Don't do that.
Listen to me. You're my last hope, do you know that?
You're going to listen to me.
I'm going away.
Good.
Far away.
The farther, the better.
To America,
I'm going to America.
Give me enough to get to Constantinople.
There, I'll work and make the rest.
Hear me. You're my last hope.
Put me down.
Long ago... you used to say to me when I come of age... you had something to give me.
I remember you as a little baby... soft and round and made of butter.
And I remember you in a little blue dress that your mother made you.
A little saint, with a blessed, pale face.
And your eyes, shining with God's own light.
My boy.
I thought, if only the whole world were like that.
Here, take it.
It was your grandfather's.
I don't need this,
I need money.
You need this more, take it.
It will remind you that no sheep ever saved its neck by bleating.
I'll take it and put it in the first soldier I meet.
Stavros! I'm an old woman, you can't frighten me.
Where's your money?
I need money.
It is here, under my clothing.
You're not going to America, you're your father's son.
Go home, be what you are.
Anything, anything... help me.
Anything? Anything...
I'll remember you, in America, I'll pray for you.
You?
You're going to America?
With the help of Jesus.
On foot?
However.
With nothing?
Each day, part of the distance.
How will you get there with those?
Take these.
Where do you come from?
Far away.
See those clouds? Behind those clouds there are mountains.
The mountains of Armenia.
I shall never see them again.
I'll remember you.
Isaac!
Isaac, the family is eating.
Isaac, I've brought you some food.
I want you to eat something.
He did this once before, stayed in there for nine days.
Isaac.
Isaac.
You're forgetting who you are.
If I want food, I'll call you.
I don't want to see you,
I want to see my son.
Stavros.
Stavros.
Where are your shoes?
What did you do with your shoes?
I've been waiting for you.
What? Where?
Where have you been?
Vasso, leave.
Yes, Isaac.
Remember, you're talking to your father.
Come here, boy.
Sit close to me.
You look changed.
When I don't see you for a day, you look changed.
Will you have a coffee?
No, thank you father.
You'll have a coffee with me.
Two coffees, immediately.
Immediately.
Look at your feet.
Make sure the shutters are closed.
The door!
Father...
I've made up my mind.
We're going to send you to Constantinople.
What did you say, father?
Our family is going to leave this place. You'll go first.
You will take everything this family has of wealth.
You will.
I said everything of wealth... this family has.
Dig.
Dig.
This winter, I'll come here at night and we'll weave together.
By the day of your wedding, you'll have all the blankets you need.
From time to time,
I've had to do things that...
We live by the mercy of the Turk.
But, Stavros, I've always kept my honour safe inside me.
Safe, inside me.
And see, we're still living.
After a time, you don't feel the shame.
Dig.
Lace collars? What will you do with them, dearie?
Make yourself pretty?
It's too late, little dearie.
Yesterday, I got this from our cousin in Constantinople.
I'll be honoured. Let Stavros bring money for my business... and I'll make him my partner.
He has a prospering establishment, a prospering establishment.
Will it really be better for us in Constantinople?
Yes, it will be.
Where else can we go?
It's our last hope.
You'll take our smoked meat.
You'll take the two big rugs on the floor upstairs.
In fact, everything you can sell.
Our donkey, you'll take our donkey... and sell him when you get to Constantinople.
The jewellery...
The jewellery which came with Vasso... when I took her for a wife.
This was my mother's.
See? She's wearing it there, look.
I was going to give it to you when you got married.
It's better this way, mother.
In time, you'll bring your three sisters...
Are the shutters closed?
You'll bring your three sisters to Constantinople.
As the eldest, your responsibility is to see they marry well.
Then, as your business prospers... you'll bring your four brothers out to your side.
As the eldest, your responsibility is to set them up in business.
Then it will be your mother's turn.
It is your responsibility to make her final days happy ones.
Don't ask too much.
Vasso, there's a right way and a wrong way.
Yes, Isaac.
We commit our eldest son to your care.
Watch over him, he is our hope.
Mother.
He's trusting you with everything...
Vasso!
Forgive me, Isaac.
Teach him that the meek shall inherit the earth.
Except here.
Each and all men are brothers.
Trust no one.
A gentle word and a Christian smile will turn away all wrong.
He's given you his coat.
I've sewed the money into the lining.
Feel it? Here.
And in this little sack, jewellery, feel it?
Keep this coat on at all times.
Even when you're asleep.
Sleep with one eye open.
Vasso, be silent!
Vasso...
Vasso, what is it?
My dear God...
If you send him to the baker's to bring bread... you're never sure he'll come back.
And now, Constantinople, with everything we have.
Look at him.
Look at him.
Vasso... if you and I... have so brought up our eldest son... that he could fail his family at this time... then we deserve to go down.
Mother...
I won't fail you, Mother.
Come on, now.
What are you doing?
I can't swim!
Be careful, the donkey, you'll knock him in!
What are you doing?
I'll give you whatever you want.
I can't swim!
I'll give you more money.
God will punish you.
God knows my problems.
Be grateful I'm not looking what's on the donkey's back.
Thief! Catch him!
Catch him! Thief!
Thief! Thief! Thief!
Catch him! Catch him!
How will I ever thank you?
It is I who am fortunate.
I, only I, brother.
This road to Ankara... is the home of every mother-selling bandit bastard in Turkey.
What good fortune is mine to meet a brother on the road!
I beg you, it is my good fortune, not yours.
What a sweet smile you have.
You and I, brothers?
Anything I have, is yours.
Just as I know everything you have is mine.
Brother!
Brother, my heart aches, when I see this poor animal... struggling with this load on his back.
I'm sure that at this very moment,
Allah is saying to himself...
"When will that man, who is always smiling... finally become aware of the pain he is causing this poor beast?"
Do you think that is possible?
No...
Yes, I mean...
Then we must insist that my animal share the load...
I insist. After all, smoked meat is heavy.
So? So, as we are brothers of the road... our animals must be brothers as well. Come on, help me.
Get down, get down.
Mukur.
Brother, I know this town well.
I've been a helpless victim of many a bandit in the town of Mukur.
We'll camp here, on this hillside.
What will we do for food?
Delicious. Delicious meat.
Here, brother, eat.
Food is strength. We've 9 or 10 days' journey to Ankara.
They say the Prophet walked barefoot... but it must've been over different roads.
I can go no further.
I thought these shoes would last... but I expected to ride. I wasn't prepared for all this walking.
See?
What do you think?
I beg you, consider... my brother sold a side of delicious meat his family entrusted to him.
This is my price.
Brother, I did my best.
How are the shoes?
They pinch.
My feet are covered in boils and sores.
Perhaps you could rest in the next town.
And you?
I'll go on.
Oh, no, brother,
I could never leave you.
Why?
Never, never.
No, I would never leave you,
I could never abandon my brother... but I must have one drink.
Brother, my soul is thirsty, my heart is dry... surely you would not deny me one miserable drink.
I confess I can't pay for this one.
You didn't pay for the others.
It was unnecessary for you to remind me that I am less fortunate than you.
After all, in friendship, there is only one rule.
What's mine, is yours and what's yours, is mine.
You have nothing.
As the Prophet said,
"Who can place a price on wisdom?"
Despite the Prophet, this is the last I pay for.
You wish you'd never met me.
For some reason you cannot speak what is obvious.
I had hoped my brother would be for the entire journey.
Only last week, a man was murdered between here and Ankara... not far from this town on the road to Ankara.
Behold...
Allah weeps for me.
Allah weeps for me!
Allah!
Allah, here I am!
Abandoned, without friends... alone, without shelter!
Abdul, come on, Abdul!
All of you, go on.
No money, no roof.
Get out in the rain.
Go ahead.
You can't stay here. You chickens, where do you think you're going?
That boy has plenty of money.
Brother, I've decided not to leave you.
You don't seem as happy as I am.
Where's that famous smile?
Smile!
I confess, I sold the meat, but I did it for you, I swear.
They say a rope drawn too taut will snap.
Now, look.
Look what I've brought you.
Chingana.
Chingana is for you.
I don't know the other's name, but we'll find out all about her soon.
Join us, come, come!
The bear has a nose for females!
Here, give me that chair.
There's a Greek, attacking without warning!
Thank you.
I forgive him everything.
Brother.
I brought up everything out of the rain, brother!
What happened?
What, brother? They're all here, every beautiful item.
Oh, my God.
What have you done?
Look, look!
Oh, my God.
They're all here.
Every single item.
Where are my sister's blankets?
While you were asleep, this woman has given me unspeakable pleasure.
My sister's blankets.
Where is my coat?
You're wearing it, brother.
Look, here.
Oh, my God.
I know she must look like a beast.
I'll admit that when one is older one's tastes are easily satisfied... but do not go by her appearance, take her into the other room.
Penetrate to her soul, go on!
My mother's rug!
I have never met a more generous and brotherly person than you.
This trip is a landmark in my life.
You're my brother.
Where is my mother's rug?
I beg you, don't use that tone of voice.
Never mind my tone of voice, where is my mother's rug?
You animal!
You animal, where is my mother's rug?
I gave it to him.
To him? You gave my rug to him?
What for? What for?
To pay for your night's lodging that's what for.
You can pay for your room in money. Cash!
Give me my sister's blankets!
It is a rag. I was ashamed to have my friends see it... so I put it on the floor of the toilet. Give me the cash.
I beg your forgiveness,
I cannot live without it.
Before all this company,
I beg your forgiveness.
Brother, don't leave me on my knees, don't insult my soul.
Brother, I have never before been on my knees to a Greek.
With a Turk you can either be a brother or the opposite.
I warn you.
Brother.
Brother.
Brother.
Too bad.
Too bad.
That's the thief, take him.
Fortunately, Your Honour,
I've made an exact list... of every particular this man stole from me in the darkest hour.
Lies, lies!
Your Honour, he insults your court.
"One carpet, the colour of roses and the blue of midnight."
Behold, Your Honour.
As described.
A beautiful piece.
"One blanket, the colour of peaches..."
- Make him take my coat off.
- Take off the coat.
I had a terrible time after you left.
Those policemen and that judge... offered to divide my new possessions with me.
When I declined, they all helped themselves.
The judge particularly wanted the rug.
The law in this country needs considerable reform.
Look, I'll show you what I have left.
Nothing, you see?
Nothing.
There are some coins missing.
About six of them, by my estimates.
I came to the conclusion that you'd swallowed them.
No?
I saw you do so in court.
At the time, I thought to myself
"Let him have something, poor thing."
But the situation has changed.
I cannot be so generous.
I'll admit that you've been patient.
If I'd been you, I'd have taken out that blade... and put it to its proper use, but we Turks are primitive... while you Greeks are civilised.
I envy you. You've learned how to bear misfortune... swallow insult and indignity and still smile. I truly envy you.
Well? Is there anything?
Anything moving?
Nothing yet?
How long do you suppose?
Only Allah know that, eh?
Drink?
You're really such a coward.
I've killed men like you before, it's like killing a sheep.
One clean cut almost anywhere and the life flows out.
A twitch or two, and it's over.
A drink?
No, of course, you don't drink.
You don't fight.
You have no use for women.
What kind of a man are you?
I can't waste any more time on you.
I'll have to take those coins.
Unfortunately, I have no weapon.
I'll have to borrow your knife.
Yes?
No?
What? Why don't you say something?
Are you afraid to talk?
Do you value your life?
Say.
I don't know what you people are.
Are you like sheep? They won't fight for their lives either.
Well... it's the hour of prayer.
I'll give you a few minutes.
Allah!
Great by name, great is thy greatness.
There is no deity, but thee.
I seek refuge near you, Allah.
Suchut! Suchut!
Suchut!
Constantinople train!
Constantinople train!
Constantinople.
That's all I have.
Constantinople train!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
America, hey America!
Hey, America!
Is she an American lady?
No, really, thank you.
You won't find a piece like this...
Where is this street?
What do you want?
Can't you see I have customers?
- How's business?
- No business.
Is this the establishment of Topouzoglou?
Yes. What do you want?
We want nothing.
I'm his cousin.
When will he wake up?
When business comes.
You brought dirt in,
I'll have to sweep again.
I just swept it, just now, five minutes ago.
Topouzoglou, this man says he's your cousin.
Welcome, welcome.
What happened to you?
I had a bad dream.
My treasure.
Eat, eat, that's it.
You eat the head?
Good for the brain!
So you see, I have many customers.
What I need is more stock.
The rugs I sell...
What is it?
Forgive me.
I was merely going to say that...
You don't... seem to be selling what you have.
You are very sharp.
I do not have the proper goods for the market as it is today.
What I will do, after you know the business... is take the money you've brought and go to Persia... and buy the kind of goods...
What's the matter?
Why did you eat my lunch?
I was hungry.
Go, out of my sight!
No, don't go, please, sit down.
For God's sake, give me a chance to swallow this.
Here, ruination, sweep.
Come in, come in.
Well, I will write to your father.
He's a good man, if in time...
No! No! Listen, no.
He must never know what happened.
Promise. Not a word.
I only meant to say that in time...
It would kill him.
He put everything in me.
Everything?
Everything.
It will kill him.
I'm going to make it up to him.
I have big plans.
They're going to be proud of me.
But now, now nothing.
Not a word, promise?
Not a word.
All right, I promise.
Go on, sweep.
I have big plans.
My ruination.
Look how the rich come to work off their lunch in their cars, while...
Stavros, listen.
There goes Aleko Sinnikoglou, a man with lots of money... and four daughters, each plainer than the other.
So much, every day he more and more loses the hope... of becoming a grandfather, do you understand?
God solves all problems.
You must not forget that you are a young man, handsome... and if properly dressed...
Do you understand me now?
Never mind, sweep.
Tomorrow, I'll arrange the meeting, you'll see.
I'll dress you in a nice blue suit and...
What? What are you doing?
You barbarian!
- What about the tariff for carriage?
- No, we'll ignore that.
I see. Well, this was...
What do I need to go to America?
Money.
First class accommodation.
How much?
Third class, 110 Turkish pounds.
I'll do it right away.
Is he American?
From Berkeley.
Do you give these men something?
No, we do it the right way.
I'll be back.
What did he say?
"At any rate, he didn't bring a single penny, says he was robbed.
I tried to talk to him, as is my place and duty... but suddenly he threw down a broom... and ran out of the store, his eyes on fire."
Now, listen.
"Beloved father, I went, as you asked, directly to our cousin... but I couldn't trust him.
No one ever comes into his store.
He sleeps all day on a pile of rugs so I told him I was robbed.
I left.
Now I have a new plan.
Keep it up!
Hang on.
Wind the rope tight.
Wind the rope further.
Go on, hamal!
- Doesn't your friend eat?
- What's the matter, you sick?
You, hamal, don't you get hungry?
Learn to spend the coins.
What are you saving it for?
"Beloved father"...
Mama, mama.
"I know Mother is worried."
We have a letter, close the shutters.
"But, there's no cause to be.
My health is good... and my appetite is very good, very good."
This isn't garbage, it's from the Sultan's table... what he doesn't eat.
"One way or another,
I get what I need to eat.
So don't worry, one day, you'll be proud of your son.
Remember, I have big plans.
Big plans.
That day will come, I promise you.
You'll be proud of me."
I'm cold, I need a woman tonight.
You want to come?
I'll pay for it. You need it.
I need nothing.
Did you ever have one?
Don't you want one?
My father wouldn't approve.
Father? Approve!
Where are you going?
I have another job.
Now? Another job?
Tonight?
Kill yourself with this, it's easier.
Take it easy.
Hold it, hold it!
It's time, they're out there working!
How much for a ticket?
What?
How much for a ticket?
110 pounds.
And you've saved by now?
What do you care?
How much?
Four pounds.
Four pounds? Now, tell me, how long do you expect to live?
Longer than you!
That load is for an animal!
Get an animal!
Hey, hamal... you.
America, America, you!
Don't take it, don't take it.
Come on!
What time is it?
You've got time.
I can't stay awake,
I keep falling asleep.
Don't worry, you'll be dead soon.
What's the baby weigh now?
How much?
Seven pounds.
Small money.
There's two kinds of money, small and big money.
Small money is a whore, you look at her coins... she's been in everyone's hands you wake in the morning, she's gone.
Then there's big money, like you need.
You're going to America.
What you need is big money.
You like that?
Behold, you're human!
That's all there is, women.
Now then, big money.
Big money is fertile, it procreates.
How, I don't know.
But it reproduces, every time you look, there's more.
But there's only two ways men like us can get big money.
Steal it, or if you're young... marry it.
You can't get it by work.
Study me.
I worked like an animal... from the first day I could walk and carry. So?
Behold, the lowest form of life.
Now, if I were you... there are very many very ugly girls with rich fathers.
Let's get ourselves a couple of those little mousetraps.
Come on, boy, you need it.
I need nothing.
You need it.
Afterwards, you come to my place,
I have one there for you.
Something nice.
I have...
I have never been with...
I don't know exactly what to do.
They show you all that.
America, America!
America, America!
Hey, Abdul...
Come on, come on.
What happened?
My money! Where's the girl?
I've got to find her.
I've got to find her!
Nine months, nine months work!
Get out of here!
Come here, you!
- Who did you give his money to?
- The owner, downstairs.
The owner?
Please don't hurt me. He was going to put me out on the street.
- Please!
- Come on.
Do you want me out on the street?
What am I without a room and a bed?
I'm an animal without a bed and a room!
If you go to whores, you must expect to be robbed.
Three months she didn't pay.
She says next week.
Three months she didn't pay.
Coffee?
We're enjoying ourselves here.
Get out.
Get out, before I get angry.
Get out, now!
If you were mighty you could've put together 110 pounds... the way you did the seven.
That way you have to have strength.
What's the use of this? Tell me that.
What's the benefit of this crying?
You want to kill her? Why not go kill her? lt'll do you good.
It's time you grew up and saw the truth.
"Big things! Big things!
They're gonna be proud of me."
"They're gonna be proud of me, some day they'll be proud."
You're nothing now and you never will be!
I am, I am, I will be!
I'm leaving.
There is a better place.
It's all the same.
Since you left home, have you met one follower of Christ?
Have you met one human being?
You.
Me?
Look at my face, you don't know me.
You don't know what I am.
You don't know who I am.
I have one idea for this world.
Destroy it and start over again.
- Who's that?
- He's with us.
There's too much dirt.
It calls for fire, it needs a flood.
I don't know where to look further, dear cousin.
He has disappeared from the face of this black world.
The chiefs of the Turkish Empire are the people themselves.
Turkey will be a great nation.
After I'm dead, I'm not interested.
He still thinks there's a clean life somewhere. America!
Look who's going to America.
America?
Don't tell me about America.
- I was there.
- Tell him.
I built one of their buildings.
I fell and then no one wanted me.
If you have money in America, you're somebody.
If you have no money, it's just like here.
Life is for the rich.
Anyone who wants to go, go now.
Again, after the explosions, we separate.
We meet one month from today.
On the streets, we don't acknowledge each other. Is that clear?
Look at him, a boy, all he wanted was something.
What? Freedom? What?
- Do you know when a man is dead?
- I can tell when a mule is dead.
It's the same, but this is a matter of hours. Throw him on the wagon.
- I'm off duty.
- Go on, throw him in. It's finished.
They won't go.
It's too heavy.
He has to go, go!
Cousin!
Cousin!
Cousin!
Oh, my God, my God!
Poor little boy, poor little boy, poor little boy.
Damn fool boy!
Maybe now you'll do what I tell you.
Please, don't tell my father.
Please, I have plans.
You have plans. My ruination!
Now, you look like money.
Go and sit over there.
In the fourth row, see?
The fourth row.
That's the girl, the one for you.
Don't stare.
Turn back, they're looking.
The one in the middle, see her?
That's the one.
So, there remains this question.
Is his father able to bring with the boy... a substantial amount of money?
- You're talking about money?
- We must talk about it.
- We have questions too.
- But you know our business.
You have four daughters, there's a necessary division.
- For each, there will be enough.
- Enough, enough.
He's here!
Aleko!
Button up, for God's sake.
Welcome, welcome to my home.
Step in, won't you?
Stavros Topouzoglou.
Glad to have you here.
- You'll never make me look pretty.
- Stop frowning, you'll get a line.
Thomna!
Would you care for a coffee?
Thank you.
Our guest will try your coffee.
How would you like it?
No sugar, thank you.
- You heard.
- Yes, father.
Please, sit down.
He has a very strong voice.
This house has been in our family for three generations.
Very nice.
- This is my brother, Serafin.
- May you live forever.
I kiss your mother's hand.
My brother, Prothermos.
I kiss you mother's hand.
This is my... Anula!
Keep those women quiet in there.
We can't hear each other.
All day, from the kitchen...
And clear her out.
All day long, muzz, muzz, muzz.
I've asked her a thousand times.
Women! God made the mistake of giving them tongues.
Stavros, Stavros...
- Has he money?
- I don't know.
Your father will find out.
You look beautiful.
May I know the nature of your father's business?
My father?
Yes.
Oh, my father.
My father is various different businesses.
That's fine, fine.
A great variety of enterprises is very wise, very wise.
Oh, yes, very.
One goes up... one goes down.
One goes up... one goes down. Excellent.
That was Thomna?
Thomna, yes.
They say that a long nose is a sign of virtue.
With a nose like that, virtue is inevitable.
They have money though.
Listen to this.
"They insisted I give up the work
I was in..."
Did he ever say what that was?
"So, what could I do? I accepted a position with their firm."
Ah, smart.
Help me...
- Anything, anything...
- Get out of here!
My shoes!
Those are my shoes.
Don't you remember me?
Don't be afraid.
Those are my shoes.
I remember you.
We made it to here, eh?
No one stops us.
We are going to get there.
I used to think so, but now I don't know.
Don't give up, don't give up now.
You're just hungry.
Are you hungry?
I'm always hungry.
Another one.
You want another pilaff?
Waiter!
Here, bring another pilaff, immediately, and more bread.
I see hamals are eating here now.
Put some of these in your shirt.
No.
Another piece, you'll need it later.
No one is looking.
You have to look out for yourself in this world, you know.
The horrible times I had was when I was... soft, or human.
You can't afford to be human.
People take advantage.
For instance, you... you smile all the time.
People take it...
Forgive me for saying so...
People take it as a sign of weakness.
In America, that will not be necessary.
I've decided.
My daughter shall come to you with 500 Turkish pounds.
I do not accept.
- Why?
- Aleko, Aleko...
Why, my boy?
What do you want?
110 pounds.
There's something about you
I don't understand.
But, have it your own way.
The main thing is she wants you.
110 it is, right?
Right.
Yes, that's satisfactory.
Then, smile.
Don't you ever smile?
So it shall be, two months.
The sooner, the better.
Two months. Two months.
And one more thing... it is our understanding that you will be living here with us.
You will not take our daughter away from us.
I will not take your daughter away from you.
Of course.
At last, I have a son.
Too much food.
Too much.
I tell those women not to put so much food on the table.
They don't listen to me.
Always, too much.
Anula! Too much food!
Always!
First fish, then chicken, then lamb...
Two would be enough.
They don't listen.
- So, you're going to leave me then.
- Oh, Baba.
Oh, Baba!
One more week... one more week and
I'm going to lose my daughter.
- Are you happy?
- Oh, Baba...
I'm frightened.
That's natural.
But, you like him?
Yes.
Yes.
But, he's so mysterious.
Maybe he's frightened too.
- What does he say when you're alone?
- Nothing.
- He never talks to you?
- Never.
Yes, once he showed me some pictures in a book.
- Pictures?
- Of a city in America.
Very tall buildings.
He told me all about them... how tall they were, as if he'd been there.
He told me he once had a dream to go there.
I didn't know what to say.
Baba.
Baba...
Don't worry, don't worry.
All boys have dreams.
I had the same dreams, once... when I was a boy, to go to new lands, start a new life.
But... people think one way when they're penniless... and another way when the money comes.
I wish he were more like... like you!
There's no man like your Baba, no man, anywhere.
Don't worry, we'll make him forget about the other.
I'll give him money, and you'll give him babies... your mother will put flesh on his bones and he'll be a man.
Yes. Oh, yes.
Oh, Baba, I feel better.
Look at him.
Go ahead, let it out, let it out.
Let it out! You've got a stomach, let it out!
Come on, come on, don't be ashamed.
Let your stomach out, it's natural.
You didn't take your coffee.
No, no supper.
I shall not eat again until tomorrow.
You'll feel different in a few hours.
I do not wish to see food again today. That is final.
- He always says that.
- What are you showing him?
- Pictures of the island.
- The island?
The island is beautiful, we have a beautiful place there.
My boy, we'll go there this summer.
We'll pack the two donkeys, and go for a picnic.
He's talking about food already.
By next summer,
I'll have digested this meal.
There are beautiful places for a picnic.
- Flying insects.
- What?
Anula doesn't like flying insects.
Buzz, buzz! We'll have the picnic on our porch.
A wonderful porch, it's screened.
A king would be lucky to have it.
You and I will sit there,
Stavros... with plenty of women to look after us.
- We'll wait, the years will pass...
- Only nine months.
I know it takes only nine months.
Whatever it takes, we'll wait.
Nine months, ten, so long as it's a boy.
A son, and then another.
Two sons first, after that, I don't care.
- You can't order.
- I know! Who should know better?
Give me two sons... give me two sons, and I'll give you the business, everything.
My share. My brothers are there, but there's plenty for everyone.
Just give me two sons, and then watch the years go by.
The winters here, summers in the island.
Pretty soon your eldest will say...
"Father, I've met a girl,
I'd like to get married."
You'll say, "How much money has she got? What dowry will she bring?"
You'll get heavier and Thomna will get bigger... in certain places, especially.
Like Anula.
I didn't say where.
And watch the years pass.
You'll get old,
I'll be old... and we'll sit here together, you and I... and we'll drink and we'll eat... and unbutton the tops of our trousers... and we'll take a nap... right here, side by side, a little nap.
The women will muzz-muzz from the kitchen... and then we'll wake and play a little backgammon.
Soon, it will be time for a little ouzo, some olives... a little cheese...
And all my children and all your children will be here... together.
And only you and I will talk,
Stavros... because I've taught my women respect.
When you talk, everyone will be quiet.
And when I talk, even you will be quiet.
And when I die... we will die properly... surrounded by women looking after us.
How does that sound to you?
That's all a man should want.
I've a little surprise for you both.
Come, follow me.
Come.
Women! Women, quickly, follow me! Hurry, now.
Hurry, now!
Come on!
Come on, come on.
Come, now.
Make way!
Who lives up there?
I don't know.
Hurry, hurry!
For God's sake, come on!
Stavros...
Take it.
It's yours. Go ahead.
God bless you.
Come on.
For you.
Get a hold of yourself.
This is your bedroom, Stavros.
Stavros, see this here... everything here belongs to someone.
Baba, thank you, but please, take everybody away now.
I want to find out how he likes it.
I will, my heart.
Out, out, out!
Everybody out.
Come on, get out.
Stop bothering Stavros.
She's not bothering me...
I like your family.
Do you like me?
Yes.
Would you tell me if you didn't?
No, I wouldn't, but I do like you.
A husband should like a wife.
I'm sorry, you don't have to say anything.
Shall we go?
No, let's stay here.
I've never talked to you without my family.
We have.
If you say so.
When?
Several times.
Of course.
Stavros, please don't take offence at what I'm going to say... but it seems to me... that you have some worry... some secret that you're not...
No.
Not that I'll expect you to tell me everything... or anything, if you don't want to.
I want everything to be the way you want it to be.
Do you hear me?
Yes, Thomna.
I wish I were prettier for you.
Don't worry about that.
But, I'm a good girl.
You'll see,
I am a good girl.
Just tell me what you want me to do.
I'll do anything you tell me to do.
Thomna.
Thomna, please stop crying.
Stop crying, please.
Please, stop.
I'm frightened.
Of what?
Of your silence.
Say something.
Say something to me.
Say something, please!
Say something!
Something, something, something, something!
I'm sorry.
I've been nervous all morning.
I had a dream last night.
Can I tell you about it?
If you like.
Do you want to hear it, or don't you?
Do you want to hear it?
Would you like a glass of water?
No!
I'm sorry, I'm ashamed of myself.
I'm acting like a... like a young girl.
I dreamt... that we had a child.
The baby looked like you... with fuzzy brown hair all over his head... and soft all over.
And the back of his neck was straight and proud like yours.
The little thing was hungry... so I opened myself to it.
And he came to me with his mouth... and there was no milk.
I had no milk.
And he pulled at me and pulled at me...
I don't think I can tell you the rest.
Turn your head away just a little bit.
The baby had teeth.
The teeth hurt.
The baby turned into you.
I mean... it was you.
And... you pulled back... and you looked at me with such disappointment... and then you walked away... and I never saw you again.
Do you believe in dreams?
Yes.
You'd do that?
Yes.
Stavros, what are you saying to me?
Stavros...
America?
Yes.
And you...?
I still don't understand...
You mean you want it so much?
You have to be... what I am... to understand.
What will you do now?
I don't know, something.
Stavros...
If you want to take our money... and go to the United States of America...
No.
I'm yours, Stavros.
What I have is yours.
How can you be like that?
I have no reason to live, except you.
I just wish I were prettier for you.
How can anybody be like you?
How can anybody be like you?
Thomna.
Don't trust me.
For your happiness, don't trust me.
You're all I have.
I can't do different.
Don't trust me.
Stavros.
Stavros... it will pass, Baba said so.
Once we have children, you won't feel the same way.
You can't, how could you?
What?
Stavros, it will pass.
I'll count on it.
Don't count on it.
Where are you going?
Wait!
Wait one year, and then if...
Of course, it's up to you to decide.
I won't say anything to my father,
Stavros.
I'll wait.
I saved these pretty pieces, nine by twelve, for you.
Faster, boys!
In the back of the store, like eggs under a hen.
Go on, show it!
Come on!
This was woven, ideal for the home... of the biggest American millionaire.
Feel. You know rugs better than I... but you've never seen anything like it.
Yes, yes, yes.
I know.
Mrs. Kebabian,
Mrs. Kebabian...
I beg you, put your hands on this, feel.
She doesn't know about the business except how to live off it.
Well, if only for her pleasure.
Feel it.
Can I see you later, for a minute?
Stavros! Wake up, for God's sake, and bring this rug over here.
- What's the matter?
- Don't inconvenience yourself.
I don't like rugs.
Mrs. Kebabian, may I present the future king.
One day, all this will be his.
Stavros Topouzoglo, my future son-in-law.
Stavros, kiss Mrs. Kebabian's hand.
You don't have to kiss my hand, boy.
Of course, in America, you don't do that.
Would you please show him how they do in America?
Believe me when I tell you that this boy's whole dream...
Mr. Sinnikoglou, don't tell me, tell my husband.
He's going to buy, he's just torturing you first.
May I offer you some sherry?
It's very sweet, very light sherry.
- No, thank you.
- It's really very light.
No, thank you.
Show him how they do in America,
Mrs. Kebabian.
- Go on.
- Well...
Here...
No, not like that, take hold of it.
Good, now, shake it like this.
You do this too, in America?
I mean, men to women?
- Of course.
- His whole dream... is to go to America, imagine!
- People have done it.
- But not a boy, like this.
Men! Aratoon, where are you going?
Aratoon, don't go.
The rug.
I'm beat. My stomach is my clock.
- All right, I'll take 25.
- Take them all.
You're American?
Yes. I was born here...
Mr. Kebabian brought me to America
25 years ago when we married...
What?
Sofia, I'm going.
I'm not.
But you must. They're waiting for us at Abdullah's.
- My package!
- I spoke to the shop.
Later, please.
...when I told him that
Mr and Mrs Aratoon Kebabian...
You know that everything you ever ate here was remarked on.
She must come, she's getting thinner.
She doesn't eat.
I married a woman, now look.
I don't enjoy eating when I'm not hungry.
See how she talks back?
They ruined her.
The day she became an American citizen, ruined.
The declaration of independence was politics only... not for women!
There's no hope for her.
- Sofia, I'm leaving the carriage.
- Aratoon!
Stavros, help her with the package.
Aratoon, Aratoon.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Hello, Madam.
- Bertha, get lunch for Mr...
Topouzoglou.
No, don't trouble yourself.
Put the packages on the sofa.
See what Mr. Topouzoglou will have.
No, too much trouble, too much trouble.
No. No, it's not any trouble.
I don't enjoy eating when I'm not hungry.
Well... all Greeks are taught to refuse twice.
It's the third refusal that's to be believed.
Can I get you something?
You've been so kind.
That's a bureau?
A whole bureau?
And it travels with you?
Can I...?
Please, come in. Here.
And down there, look, that's for shoes.
America, America!
Do you have any magazines from there?
Pictures?
Would you like to see them?
Can I?
I'll show you the "Saturday Evening
Post" and "Ladies' Home Journal".
No, no more, Mrs. Kebabian.
- Is he still here?
- Yes, Mrs. Kebabian.
Good.
You still here?
He's still here.
Good evening, Mr. Kebabian.
- He'll have dinner with us.
- Don't put your things on my bed.
He'll show us some dancing.
Do you know where we can see dancing?
You do, don't you?
Yes.
Enough! Enough!
I pay, I pay!
I pay!
I pay!
I was eighteen when my father said to marry him.
I'd never been permitted to see... that wonder of man, alone, till him.
The day after the wedding... he took me to America... and before I knew how,
I had two sons.
After that...
What?
He'd had what he wanted of me.
There I was... an almost old woman... two sons, a husband with a good business... who played cards every night.
I have never known... a young man.
I've never lived my 20th year or my 21st... my 22nd year... is still inside me, waiting like a baby to be born.
Do you understand?
How could you understand?
Let's take him home.
Third class reservation,
110 pounds, please.
First, give me the ticket.
Yes, sir.
I'm Mr. Agnastis.
Do you have my tickets ready?
- Yes.
- I'm here with my boys.
Yes, let me find your ticket.
You! You're going, eh?
Didn't I tell you not to give up?
You're good.
Tell me what happened.
That man is taking us all.
Eight boys, yes, in one cabin.
That was the understanding.
I've done this every year, eight boys in one cabin... you've always allowed it.
- Only now, suddenly, objections.
- Just a moment.
You're all going?
Yes.
There's a place to shine shoes in New York City.
He's paying our passages.
What do you do?
We shine shoes.
We work for him... two years, without pay.
Would he take another?
No.
Many boys want it, but he'll only take eight.
I came to the store once to tell you, but... you got into a carriage with a rich man.
You looked very busy, very big... plenty to eat, so I thought...
Right or wrong is for the rich.
You can afford it, I can't.
You come from a good family.
Yes, who are now waiting for one piece of good news.
One piece!
But your father...
I don't want to be my father, or your father...
I don't want that good family life, good family life... all those good people stay here and live in this shame.
The churchgoers who give to the poor live in shame.
The respectable, polite ones with good manners.
But, I am going.
No matter how. No matter, no matter. I am going!
I told you to come here... because I wanted to tell you the truth.
The truth of what I am, so you don't go on thinking about me.
You took off your...
That was for your father.
What's that?
Oh, are you taking that with you?
Of course. You can't count on anybody or anything.
With this,
I can always eat.
Oh, Stavros.
I know that I'll never again find anyone like you.
Oh, God!
What will happen to you?
I believe...
I believe that, in America...
I believe that I will be washed clean.
Mr. Topouzoglou.
Would you like some tea?
Madam prefers it when you smile.
I've been waiting.
Bertha... how do flies get on a ship?
Mr. Agnastis, what's that over there? Is that land?
America!
America, America!
- What's the disturbance?
- Long Island.
Oh, well...
- How long did I sleep?
- A couple of hours.
I'll tell Mrs. Kebabian you're awake.
- Mr. Kebabian is awake.
- Correct.
- She'll come as soon as she's pretty.
- I have a long wait.
Casino.
Bertha...
Now, come, Bertha, just the truth.
Stavros!
Stavros!
Hohaness!
Stavros.
America!
Stop it.
Stop it, all right.
Look, I brought you some candy.
Here, take it, come on.
That lady friend of yours... has the most wonderful candy.
Tomorrow, I'll get one of those straw hats that the Americans wear.
First thing.
Tomorrow, since you're without protector or employment... the authorities will ship you back where you came from.
Now, may I give you some advice?
Go fall on your knees before
Aleko Sinnikoglou... shed a tear or two, however false, kiss his hand and so on.
He'll take you back, he has no choice.
And from this unpleasantness, learn this lesson... when you force a woman to choose, she'll choose money, eh, Emilio?
Well?
She's a good person.
She's next door, her ear to the door... hearing every word, why is she silent?
Well?
I'm curious, what are you going to do now?
You know, I've never seen a face like yours except in a cage.
I think there's nothing you'd stop at.
Anything. Have you any honour?
Honour?
My honour is safe inside me.
Safe inside you?
Boy, whatever you once were, you're now a whore... a boy whore for sale, do you understand?
Stop that humming.
I've seen hundreds like you.
Boys who leave home to find a clean life and just get dirtier.
Stop that humming!
Tell me, have you looked in the mirror recently?
Do you suppose if your father saw you he'd recognise his son?
Stop it! Stop it!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
He's done more for me than you've done in your entire life!
I won't let him do that to you,
I won't.
I won't let him do that to him.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Go on, now.
Go on.
Don't let him do that to you.
Go on, now.
Don't worry about me.
I won't let him do that...
Mr. Kebabian...
He's going to speak.
Yes, sir.
I've nothing to say.
What can you say? The truth is the truth. You know what you are.
Yes, sir.
Except, Mr. Kebabian,
I have been bitten... robbed, shot, left for dead.
I have eaten the Sultan's garbage... and driven the dogs off to get at it.
I became a hamal...
Now, you understand yourself, a hamal.
Yes, sir.
But now, I am here.
Do you imagine anyone will be able to keep me out?
I'll see to it that they send you back.
No!
Help! Help! Help!
Don't say anything, please!
Please.
Please.
Let me stay.
He attacked me!
He tried to kill me!
Criminal!
This is America, do you hear?
This is America!
What will you do now, hamal, eh?
What will you do now?
Hohaness?
Hohaness?
Where are you, Hohaness?
Hohaness?
Are you there?
Oh, yes.
Is my father still here?
Your what?
Your father?
Who is that?
That's the doctor.
You're in the ship's hospital.
My father said...
"That's enough.
I'm ashamed of you.
I am ashamed of what you've made of yourself.
Come back, you must start again."
It hurts when I laugh... but can you imagine making this journey all over again?
It was a bad dream, go to sleep.
Can you imagine all this...
Better stay with me.
I'll be here when you wake.
It's still there.
You know the truth?
The thing I'd like most in the world... is to make this journey all over again.
Just to start it over, all over again.
That's the truth.
How is he?
- He's imagining things.
- Well, no wonder.
He was hit on the head once too often. You better watch over him.
I will.
That boy, he might do something crazy.
They are sending him back.
That's a bad cough.
Don't let the officials hear it when they come on board tomorrow.
They'll send you right back.
Good night.
Stavros, they're coming.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Good morning. Excuse me.
Good morning.
- Morning, doctor.
- Morning.
- This your hospital?
- Right through there.
I'll wait for you here.
As soon as the inspection is over, run to me.
See? It's the excitement that brings it on.
So close your ears... imagine you have just sent them their passage... and your mother and father come to you in gratitude.
Can you imagine that scene?
Yes, yes.
Then, imagine that scene.
Go on, now.
What are you going to do?
I have my own plans.
What?
Can you swim that far?
A man learns what is necessary.
If you can't swim, you can't...
You better go now.
Come on, go on.
Come on.
Coming through, please.
Excuse me.
I'll pay you back, some day.
Let's speak the truth, we'll not see each other again after tomorrow.
You'll forget me, and I'll be where I am.
Go on, now.
Don't forget, cover your ears.
- Well, are these the fellows?
- Yes, same as last year... eight fine boys, perfect health... all from fine families, employment guaranteed.
Remember, it's the excitement that brings it on.
It's the excitement that brings it on, so close your ears.
Thank you. I wish you all the best of luck, boys.
All right, boys, everything is all right. Mr. Allen?
- You'll come to see us, I hope.
- I'll drop in, once in a while.
- You know where our place is.
- Yes.
Stavros!
Stavros!
Stavros!
Stavros!
I mean it, Stavros, if you go,
I go, and I can't swim.
I'll hold onto you, don't do something crazy.
Don't.
- I thought your wife was coming.
- She was... but she was too sick and too old.
- In the end she gave up hope.
- I know...
Hohanness!
Hurry.
I'm going.
Here, give this to my cousin in Constantinople.
His name's here, and the address here.
He will send it to my father.
Do you understand?
That was simply awful!
- Third class is so romantic.
- The best part of the ship.
Inspection! Inspection!
He's a friend of my wife's.
Sort of a dark fellow.
Here.
From Mrs. Kebabian.
Immediately after the disembarkation... of first class... all third class passengers... will be examined...
Fifty dollars? My, my!
- Next.
- Hello.
- Look who's here.
- Eight, all told.
Eight more little ones. They keep coming, they keep coming.
How are all you little slaves?
Scared to death.
Jack, who was that Greek we're watching for?
Criminal assault, was it?
On this sheet here.
Stavros Topouzoglou...
- Any of you go by that name?
- That fellow died last night.
You, what's your name?
You.
- Hohaness.
- Not you, you. He talks, doesn't he?
What's your name?
Hohaness Gardashian.
Wanna be an American?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
The first thing to do, is to change that name.
Do you want an American name, boy?
Hohaness Gardashian.
I know.
That's enough.
Hohaness, that's all you need here, Hohaness.
Here.
Can you read?
Joe Arness.
Hohaness, Joe Arness.
Hohaness, Joe Arness.
Joe.
Joe.
Arness.
Arness.
Joe Arness.
Joe Arness.
Good.
Joe Arness.
You like it?
Joe Arness,
Joe Arness.
Good.
Well, Joe, you're reborn.
You're baptised again without the clergy. Next!
Hey, Joe Arness.
Hey, friend, what the hell is that?
Just something one of them left behind.
Hey, you there!
Keep moving, you're blocking traffic!
Come on, now. Yes, you.
Move it along, let's go!
"And here I am.
I reached America"
And here is fifty dollars.
How much is that, fifty dollars?
In Turkish money, that is... that is...
He saved himself.
How did he earn so much money so quickly?
America, America.
He saved himself.
Read it again, the last part.
"It's not different here..."
Not so loud.
There's no one.
You never can tell, go on.
"It's not different..."
How quickly he's forgotten what it is here.
"But let me tell you one thing, you have a new chance here... for everyone that is able to get here, there is a fresh start.
So get ready, you're all coming.
You're coming.
I'm working to bring you all here.
One by one".
Hey, there's a business here!
Move on!
How's that?
There you go, Joe.
Next!
Come on, you, let's go, people are waiting.
Come on, you.
Let's go, you.
People waiting.
People waiting.
People waiting.
And he did bring them.
It took a number of years, but one by one, he brought them here.
Except for his father.
That old man died where he was born.
This film was made in Turkey and Greece.
It was photographed by Haskell Wexler.
It was edited by Dede Allen.
The production designer was Gene Callahan.
The costuming, by Anna Hill Johnstone.

North Africa, September 1942
A darkest hour...
The world watches as Adolf Hitler high stepping Africa Corps sweeps onwards to Egypt and the
Suez Canal while the British, our strength dissipated by defeat make a desperate regroup at
El Alamein.
Two years had passed since the fall of France.
France now officially neutral lives under Nazi domination and the French city of Algiers is a port of embarkation for British, Italian and
German soldiers caught and interned by the French.
Prisoners for deportation.
Forward.
Captain.
Well, Leftenan... bring them aboard.
Faster.
- A Canadian, 5 Italians.
- Come quickly.
Faster, come on.
- All in order, Captain.
- Very good, Lieutenant.
- Have a good night.
- Thank you.
- Beware!
- Fire!
Extinguishers!
Stop!
Back or be shot.
- That one.
- Join us, Commander.
Ain't you forgetting this is neutral territory.
Sorry, we have no tea.
Perhaps you will settle for chocolate?
Not even name, rank and serial number?
Very well.
Name: Donald Craig.
Rank: Major, long range desert group.

Graduated work... School of Mines
Kensington.
Worked three years for Standard Oil.
Shall I continue... Major?
- What's my mother name?
- Elizabeth.
Father, John Foster Craig, retired and lives in Vancouver.
Your reluctants to talk is understandable.
If I have been force to escape across
300 miles of enemy held desert, and if after all of that...
I've been captured by
French authorities,
I too would be embarassed.
Captian Bergman.
Very British of you, Major.
Before you go any further, take a look at your escort.
I'm sure you can recognised an English fighter when you see one.
Who are you?
Special Identification group.
The G. E. I.
- I thought they were all...
- Jews, Major.
Yes, we are.
German Jews serving with the British.
However as German's, we still have our uses.
French will think this is a Nazi raid.
Have more respect for the enemy, Major.
What's all these? Haven't you seen a bloody airplane before?
Go away!
Lieutenant Boyden, signals.
Welcome to Kufra, Major... such as it is.
- Colonel Harker is expecting you.
- I would hope so, Lieutenant...
I would certainly hope so.
Yes but of course.
Come along... man.
The Colonel's waiting.
Colonel Harker, sir!
Major Craig and Captain Bergman reporting.
Oh... thank you, Boyden.
Captain Bergman. Hello Craig!
Glad you could come.
I'll get right to it.
Sometimes ago you submitted a plan to staff... hardlining a proposed raid on the
German fuel bunkers at Tobruk.
In his infinite wisdom, staff turned my plan down.
Things do have a way of changing, don't they... Major?
Rommel is 90 miles from Suez.
Every shell, every gallon of petrol he gets has to come 300 miles from Tobruk.
The RAF is doing its best but still too much is getting through.
So we're gonna have a go at Rommel source of supplies.
Didn't I said something to... provoke humour?
Staff has a genius for sitting on it's brain and coming up with perfect hindsight.
Would you cared to expand on that?
When I submitted the plan we could have blown up their fuel bunkers with a handful of men.
How in the hell are we supposed to get through their defences now?
Drive through, Major.
Disguised as prisoner of war guarded by
Captain Bergman personal
African Corps.
The plan is still basically yours but now it will be maximum effort land, sea and earth.
Colonel, could you direct me to the nearest bus stop?
We are here...
Tobruk, here.
Your primarily responsibilities is to route our convoy through 800 miles of the west desert the Sahara has to offer right into the back door of Tobruk.
That's why we went to so much trouble and it was no lark, you know... Major, to bring you halfway across
North Africa.
I didn't ask for the trip, Colonel.
- I've been here before.
- Precisely.
Staff believed that your practical knowledge of the terrain is essential on the success of our mission.
That is your job, Major.
Ours begin when we get there.
After we've knocked out their harbour guns installation, we linked up with naval assault troops, destroyed the fuel bunkers and evacuate by sea.
Their heavy guns are here,
Mersa Cove...
- It's suicide.
- It's orders.
- How many days do we have?
- Eight.
Impossible.
Impossible or not, it will be done and on schedule.
Do I make myself clear, Craig?
Welcome aboard, Major Craig.
We don't get many volunteers.
Keep your eyes and ears open around the Jews, little trust all right, there's no point in overdoing it.
Six years in Palestine taught me that.
And for your information,
I'm the genius with perfect hindsight.
Never doubted it, Colonel.
We leave in 1 hour, Lieutenant Boyden will see to your needs.
Major Craig... don't let personal differences of opinion interfered with our operation.
I understand, Colonel.
I liked you to bear one thing in mind when and if we reached Tobruk, my mother didn't raise any heroes.
A bloody work of art, matey but I do say so meself.
Save the Jerry the trouble of repainting if we are taken.
Now, that's a cheery thought.
Handsome.
Come on, get cracking.
Never get the Victoria Cross for admiring yourself.
It's chai cross we're after, sir.
I think Dolan is a feeling a touch of the sand and sun, Major.
You'll be feeling a touch of my boots if you don't hop to.
This is Libya, not London.
Well, damn bloody hell!
Soldiers, get off the vehicle!
Line up, hurry!
Attention, stand still!
Lieutenant, troops in formation.
Ooh... got a cold feeling down the back of me neck just looking at 'em.
What kind of bleeding mission are we going on anyway, sir?
You know when you're supposed to and not before.
Maybe you don't know either,
Sergeant Major.
All right... all right, what is this going on with the lot of you?
Come on now.
Sergeant Major!
Sir!
Do you have your orders regarding my men?
We'll have no dealings with you as soldiers unless otherwise instructed, sir.
See to those orders are complied with,
Sergeant Major.
Sir!
Attention, break ranks!
Taking orders from a ruddy Kraut!
What's this bleeding war coming to?
If my father in Tel Aviv could see me here now, fighting for the British, he would take back my Bar Mitzvah.
War and politics, Mohnfeld.
They're always mix.
There are just the same if he ever finds out. He'll give me an a bris.
Well, now we know how the Italians must feel with their German allies.
And the English will throw us to the wolves just as quick...
If we let them.
Get the men ready, Sergeant.
You got bullets in that thing, mate?
- Talking to the blighty enemy.
- We're supposed to be prisoner...
...Alfie. You know the orders, no fraternizing.
No fraternizing, I just asked him if he's got bullets in that chopper.
I don't want him to take his play acting too much to heart.
An opportunity, he says.
- Who says?
- The judge.
I'm giving you the chance to serve your country and to come back to society as a respectable citizen.
God bless him.
You wouldn't want to be back in London, Alfie... not with all them bombs the Jerry are dropping.
Do us a favour, all they ever did.
It's always been hospitals and churches.
They couldn't hit Brixton prison in a 100 years.
God, it ain't half hot.
Just like being on a roller coaster.
Bruckner!
- Yes!
- Come here.
Enemy column, tanks!
Italian's, sir.
No flanking scouts.
If we were an attack force, they'd have little chance.
They should cleared us by 1000 yards.
Unless they altered directions,
- Lieutenant Boyden.
- Yes, sir.
- I want every man armed and ready.
- Sir!
You know when you come to think of it,
Brixton prison's really a nice place.
You're getting soft in the konk, Alfie.
All 8 feet thick of regular bleeding bomb shelter.
If I could get my hands on that judge...
- Sending innocent to the slaughter.
- Innocent?
I will give something.
The whole damn Sahara and they have to stop here.
- So, Major?
- More company, sir.
Over there... on the other side.
They must be Germans.
The Italians are too fond of comfort to travel this late.
Their sentry hasn't seen them yet.
Take what man you need Bergman and make sure they don't.
Bruckner, come with me.
What do you estimate the range?
2.000 yards, maybe even less.
Twice the reached range of our mortars.
I'll get the range finder.
And prepared mortars.
You all right?
You, okay?
Lieutenant Boyden, sir.
You don't mind me asking...
What's the old man up to now?
A lovely scheme, Alfie.
A lovely scheme.
He's going to start a bit of fighting between the Italians and the Germans.
How's he going to do that, sir?
First we open fire on the Germans, then our mortars hit the Italians.
Now the Italians see the German's column and vice-versa.
So both of them got to thinking it's the British army on the other side that's doing all the firing, you see.
And you got themselves a bloody battle going.
Right.
- Blimey, you think we'll make it sir?
- Know any good prayer, Alfie?
Range?
Eight hundreds.
- Sergeant Major....
- Sir.
- Tell Mr Boyden to open fire.
- Sir.
Gentlemen, it's time we're moving.
It's like a bloody furnace.
Cheer up, it could get worse.
What's the devil are you doing?
We're making excellent time on the flats, why head into this area?
We leave our calling card back there in the wadi, Colonel, the Germans bound to find.
Exactly why speed is our best advantage.
They know that too.
That's why they'll spending the major part of their times guarding Kalafsho Flats while we cut through here.
Do you realised what you're suggesting, Major?
Yes, sir!
- That's a German minefield.
- That's right.
Where they're not likely to looks for us.
I don't like it.
We're turning around.
Do that Colonel and you'll reached Tobruk as a real prisoner.
It's out of the question.
Colonel Harker you went to an awful lot of trouble to shanghai me in on this mission.
If you're not going to follow my advise, what the hell am I doing here?
You can't take heavy transport through that without mine detector.
Why are you telling me?
You brought me along to tell you.
All right... Major, tell me.
Thank you, sir.
Bring up the half-track.
This time of the year, the wind is from the south.
It blows for months at a time forming a sand cushion at the base of the slope.
By keeping to the slope the deep sand will act as a pillow dispersing our weight.
Our heaviest pieces of half-track can make it, the others can.
I know the lorries wheel will bogged down but the half-track with it's track can maneuver.
But how do you propose to get the lorries through?
This is an old mine field, Colonel.
The sand covering the mines had plenty of times to settle.
By keeping to the slopes,
I will be able to see the depression over the mines.
So you intend to clear the way and pied piper us through?
That's right.
- Sergeant Major Tyne!
- Sir!
Bring a drum from the lorries with branches and camouflage
- to wipe out our tracks.
- Sir.
It may not be so simple.
The Germans often set their mines at tandem.
Tried to move one and you could take out a dozen.
It's very effective. That's why the rest of you will wait behind me.
Behind us, Major.
You can't drive and watch those depression of yours.
Suit yourself.
You're the one who volunteer.
Go to the left.
Stay to the left. It's digging in.
Goes any deeper we're going to blow up your whole theory.
To the high side.
Stop!
- Wait here.
- My pleasure!
He looks so calm, you think he was planting daisies.
You know one wrong tickle with that bayonet and we will be pushing up the daisies.
Does he expect to dig up the whole damn Sahara on his own?
- Sergeant Major Tyne.
- Sir.
Get some men with bayonets and follow me, will you?
Sir.
What have you got your fingers in your ears for?
What have you got your
- fingers in your ears for?
- I can't stand the sight of blood.
Then why don't you put your hands over your eyes?
Well, I want to see what's going on, don't I?
- I've got some men coming up.
- That won't be necessary.
Give that first one a burst, Bergman.
Down!
It's just our luck to strike oil.
Next one.
- We can move on down, Colonel.
- Let me drive.
We can move on then.
They didn't teach us that at Sandhurst, sir.
Look out the
Bungalore torpedo, Boyden.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Get cracking, there's a schedule to keep.
All right, Boyle?
Any complaints?
How about some more sugar for the cocoa, Sergeant Major?
You've had your rations that you need.
- Grub all right?
- It's wonderful.
- Any complaints?
- No, sir.
- Grub all right?
- Lovely.
- How's your arm?
- Oh, fine.
- Make good use of it, boy.
- All right.
Sir.
- Trouble?
- Carburation's off.
I'll say one thing for the Germans, they certainly know how to build an engine.
It doesn't cost much, either, when they use slave labor.
Two hundred Jew power, Major.
We all know what's going on in Europe.
Well, if you do, if you really do, there must be a little of the Jew in you.
They say there's a little of the Jew in everyone.
Jah, a little of the Nazi, too.
Your war's going to last a lot longer than mine, Captain.
It's 2000 years old now.
For the first time since Jesus, you begin to think and feel as a people.
Days of the wandering Jew are coming to an end.
We're going home.
- Palestine?
- Israel, Major.
Israel.
It's where we begin.
Anyone looking for trouble in the future, will know where to find us.
Good evening, Major.
Take cover!
- You bleedy fool!
- We're British!
Open fire!
- Sergeant Major Tyne.
- Sir!
Formed burial party and see to the wounded.
Sir!
You four, over here... on the double!
Come on, move!
We be moving since the burial parties is finished.
Why waste the time? A few bit of sand won't make any difference.
- You heard the order.
- That smoke can be seen for miles.
Look Bergman, if you have any complaints take them to the Colonel.
Or find yourself a rabbi.
It's no use, sir. It's had it.
- The emergency transmitter?
- It's dead, it was in lorry 3.
Our orders were not to break silence except in an emergency.
Cairo will assumed we're proceeding as schedule.
Let's see that we do.
Tuareg.
Hold your fire.
There's one there's more.
Wouldn't be the first time
- they attack a column.
- English column.
This column is currently listed as German.
Craig.
I'll find out what he wants.
Sergeant... your tunic and cap.
They have 2 prisoners. They want guns.
Blast!
We've to go along.
It wouldn't look right otherwise.
German's prisoners.. it's all we need.
Craig.
Agreed!
Cover me.
Krug.
Look at them.
Wish I had me rifle.
Cor, I wish I had me camera.
Trust an Arab to argue.
And if you are not interested, we will take your heads.
Peace be to you.
Well, what was that little display all about?
A bargaining point, Colonel.
He'll settled for 10 rifles and some ammunitions.
The prisoners?
British?
Father and daughter.
They wanted to be taken to the Germans.
It's absolutely essential we reached
Cairo as quickly as possible.
If we don't this campaign as well as the war itself would be vitally affected.
You expect me to believe this from someone found wandering in the desert?
Father and I left
Von Hellstern's headquarter in Benghazi three nights ago.
We would to be dropped outside
Cairo and met by a resident agent's.
Our plane had to make a force landing.
The pilot was killed.
Poor chap broke his neck when we hit.
The tribemen found us the following day.
Well, if you are to say who you are, certainly you agent's had some means of identification.
There! Signed by
Field Marshall Kesselring acting for the Führer himself.
That paper is an agreement between the Reich and a group of important Egyptian army officers.
For certain considerations they will arise against the
British in a holy war... Jihad.
The signature and seal beared all the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.
One of the most powerful men in the Muslim's world.
With Egypt on our side, we have every reasons to believe the rest of the Muslim's world would follow.
Captain, the Turks alone could put
4 millions men into the war against Russia.
Exactly, and once Rommel takes Cairo, the army of the Grand Mufti will moved against the British.
If you'll only contact Benghazi,
Captain... they can have a plane here within hours.
Regrettably our radio was destroyed.
- By a British fighter.
- Then you must provide a vehicle.
And escort us immediately to the nearest base.
Are you presuming Herr Portman to give orders to a German officer?
- But I explained.
- That you did.
And now, you will leave the rest to me.
Our destination is Tobruk.
And that's our nearest base.
Make our guests comfortable, Mohnfeld.
Of course, Captain.
Mohnfeld.
Odd name for a German officer?
We can't all be named Schmidt,
Fraulein Portman.
We've been awared of an anti-royalist faction in the Egpytian military but this...
I'll do the honours, gentlemen.
That uniform is a disguise, Bergman, don't carry it too far.
Shooting the girl wouldn't trouble the Nazi's.
If that's what bother you, Colonel.
What bothers me is going into action with officers who make rash and thoughtless move.
Portman's think this is a German column transporting British prisoners.
I want him to continue in that believe.
When we reached Tobruk,
Colonel, what then?
This paper and the Portman's guarantee our entry.
Is that all, Colonel?
No, Captain Bergman, that is not all.
While you served under me I'll expect you to conduct youself as a British officer.
You'll at all times obey my orders no matter how disagreeable it may seem to you.
That is all, Captain.
I can understand his feelings.
You flattered yourself, Major.
Their only emotions are based on percentages.
Eight men were killed today.
Five of them were Bergman's.
How does that fit into your percentages?
Craig!
Dismissed!
May I tell you something, Colonel?
You may.
You're a real joy!
Come on then sit-up.
Four.
Three.
One.
Good evening, Corporal.
I think I'll take a short walk.
- Goodnight, Corporal.
- Goodnight.
At 13:00 tomorrow we move on Tobruk.
If all goes well, we should be in position to take the harbour defense guns by 20:00 hours.
Our attack coincides with the massive raid by the RAF.
At 21:30, naval units will shell the harbour, while assault troops come ashore to link with us.
Our primary objectives,
- are the fuel bunkers here.
- Colonel...
If we can't reached the guns, how do we warn off the navy?
Jerry has a large transmitter here in the central of the city.
Let's hope it won't be necessary.
And if it's necessary, where does that leave us?
We revert to your original plan, Major.
Do what damage we can to Rommel's fuel supply, make a run for it.
Well, I don't mind running but to where?
If we're not rescue by sea, we don't get out.
I'm aware of that possibility, Major.
That's why we have an alternative pick-up down the coast at Sollum.
It's a long way to go with the
Germans on our back.
If we're capture it means a POW camp.
What about Bergman's men? They can't let themselves be taken alive.
I'm quite sure that Captain Bergman and his SIG gave that a very careful consideration before they volunteer.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Bergman.
I thought you Jews were supposed to be smart.
Enemy propaganda, mate.
Why in the hell you didn't speak up in there?
What reason?
There's no Geneva Convention for us.
Begin thinking of death and you're no longer sure of your life.
- It's a Hebrew proverb.
- A dead martyr's just another corpse!
What in God's name drive you people.
Perhaps his name is enough.
God and Colonel Harker.
Colonel is a soldier of the old school and has old school attitudes.
He doesn't care much for us.
We don't care much for him.
But he'll be there when we need him.
Let's hope they both will.
Good night, Major.
Don't turn your head.
Who are you?
A friend.
Then why hide?
Listen carefully, my life as well as yours are at stake if we are discovered.
This column is not what you think, Herr Portman.
You mean Captain Bergman and the others are not German?
Jews... SIG.
Their prisoners are commando's.
Member of the long range desert group.
Tobacco.
The tobacco of that sentry was smoking.
Our troops haven't had anything to light since the beginning of the war.
- Who the devil are you?
- That is not important.
Your mission is and these men know about it.
- You must get word to Tobruk.
- But how?
Two kilometres from here due west, you'll will find a myriad of stones in the sand.
Buried in the sand 6 metres north of that marker is a telephone cable connecting
Jalo with Tobruk.
Now...
Turn carefully... and look!
In the cistern you will find the field phone.
A pair of camouflage capes and a weapon.
Very well...
If all this has been arranged, why haven't you send for help?
I cannot miss leaving the camp.
Once you contact Tobruk, they can have an armour column here within hours.
And if I refuse?
The Iron Cross will still be yours.
Posthumously, Herr Portman.
Turn back to the wall.
Do not move for 30 seconds.
At ease!
Bruckner,
A military phone.
An English revolver.
- Take her to the car.
- Yes, Lieutenant.
Wait!
Come forth!
Come on.
- How did they get that telephone?
- It's very simple.
One among us is the enemy.
- Lieutenant.
- Sergeant.
Attention, stand still!
Order your men to unload their weapons.
I must refused to give that order, Colonel.
Sergeant Major Tyne.
Sir!
- Disarmed these men!
- Sir.
You, you and you, come with me.
That's more like it.
I never did trust 'em.
Once a Jerry, always a Jerry.
Once a thief, always a thief.
That right Alfie?
Come off it now.
Who else you think let that damn spy escape?
Captain Bergman, you have 2 hours to deliver your traitor.
Try not to move, miss.
There's a plasma tube in your arm.
- Britwaite...
- Sergeant Major.
Get the Colonel. On the double!
I'll get the M.O!
The message... did you get through?
Answer me!
- You left her alone?
- Sir!
- It's bolted, sir!
- Break it.
No one inside it seem.
Sergeant Major!
- Sir.
- Assistance!
Cyanide, I've seen it often enough.
You'll find your spy right down the shaft, Colonel.
Who is it?
I don't know.
It's very dark down there.
I found the sentry at the cistern... stabbed!
But the traitor was still in the tunnel.
He's dead!
Bruckner.
Impossible, I have known him for 10 years.
You said yourself, the girl died from cyanide.
His suicide tablet gone.
Here... Sergeant Major, look at this!
Cor, what a mess.
It's a diabolical liberty.
You know what they say, Britwaite...
Lightning never struck in the same place twice.
That tunic could be your lucky charm!
That guy can sure bleed,
I can tell you that.
Well, Boyden... what do you think of that?
- Pretty convincing, sir.
- Thank you.
I'd like a word with you, Colonel.
- Excuse us please.
- Sir!
All right Major. Get it off your chest and you'll feel better.
Do you realised what will happen if your men are taken in those uniforms?
They'll be executed.
And that doesn't bother you at all?
It's a calculated and most necessary risks.
I've given orders to return ammunitions to the SIG.
I'm also assigning armed
British troops in German uniform to cover each lorry.
How does Bergman feel about that?
This is not a popularity contest.
I don't give a damn what anybody thinks of my actions, least of all a dozen odd Jews.
No Bruckner, when the chips are down.
You passed judgement on people quickly, don't you?
Just like that and head's are supposed to roll.
Well, I 've never considered dying for a cause no matter how noble.
- And I'm not about to begin now.
- Frightened, Major?
You may have ice water running through your veins, Colonel... but I have blood and
I need every drop of it.
The way I see it, we have
2 chances of coming out of this.
- A poor one and a slim one.
- Yes, Craig.
From the beginning your boundless enthusiam has been an inspiration.
But I'm getting rather weary of being the cross that you've to bear.
Don't flatter yourself, Colonel.
I've trunks full of crosses to bear.
Feeling better, Major?
We leave in 10 minutes.
Head hunters!
Field police.
Is that necessary, Lieutenant?
I hope not, Herr Oberleutnant.
Sorry mate... orders!
Keep pace with them... 50 yards back.
Colonel, this road takes us through
Tobruk and then it branches.
To the right is the prison compound, to the left is Mersa Cove.
Well...
You're an officer, clear the way.
Move away!
Move away!
Congratulation!
Their radio towers behind us.
Colonel, I think I'd like to put in for a transfer.
Half the Africa Corps.
- The foxes done it again.
- While the British lion slept.
Gentlemen, the importance of our mission is even graver than staff realised.
That's doesn't solved the problem, Colonel.
Our men are going to land expecting light opposition and they're gonna run into
Rommel's total reserve strength.
They must be stopped.
We've to take that transmitter.
And alert Jerry, for all we know staff may have scrubbed the mission already.
- So, we just sit back and wait.
- Exactly!
If it has been cancel, we won't have given ourselves away.
What can a handful of men do against 2 full divisions?
We can try, Major.
If those tanks reach El Alamein, the Germans have Egypt.
They may have the lock, but we have the key.
Without fuel, Jerry goes nowhere!
You don't look too well, Major.
Not surprised to hear it.
We'll have to have a word with the admiralty about this.
I thought Tobruk was the name of a blockade.
Someone forgot to tell the Germans.
There's our objective.
Rommel's underground fuel dumps.
Easy to see why aircraft had such little effect.
We've located the communications cable.
The bunker can be cut off from the city anytime.
While we go for the guns, two detachments will take out those pillboxes.
Right on schedule.
Right into a meat grinder.
- Boyden, the air raid's your cover.
- Sir.
Take what men you need and go for the Jerry's transmitter.
Send an open signal to Cairo. Cancel landing, repeat... cancel landing.
And advise staff of the
Kesselring paper.
Yes, sir.
Colonel Harker.
If Lieutenant Boyden should be stopped, he doesn't speak German.
- Volunteering, Mohnfeld?
- It would improve his chances, sir.
To the air raid shelter.
Stretchers. Make room.
Make way!
Come on, move... come!
Well done.
Harry, are you all right?
Oh yeah, I'm lovely.
Let's do it again.
That's more like it, my boy. Come on!
Sir...
Sir...
He's dead.
Hurry up, it will be all over us in a minute. Lift him up.
Pry open the door.
- Got him?
- Yes.
Quick, in here!
Quick. Take cover.
Everyone, come on, quickly!
Leave him.
They have succesfully hit headquarters.
Stretchers.
Cor, that was a whisker away.
- What do we do now, Alfie?
- Good question, mate.
First of all, unload these Jerry uniforms.
My mama didnt bring me up to be shot as a bloody spy.
Dear God!
What's the matter, you hurt?
I'm dead and gone to heaven, tell her. Look in there!
Here look, English pound notes.
Millions of them!
British paymaster wrappers, Alfie.
The Jerries must've grabbed it when they took Tobruk from our boys.
Well, we better grab it back then.
Here now, wait a minute.
You've got it wrong.
We weren't going to nick this money--
We're up next, Major.
It's 21:30.
Do you think Boyden got through?
We're under attack!
Quickly, to your posts!
Landing is still on, the buzzers are coming in.
- Sergeant Tyne.
- Sir!
Take the half-track and four men up the approach road.
Use the oil's lamp to turn those barges back.
Keep flashing as long as you can, Jack.
- It's our last chance.
- Sir.
- Come in, come in?
- What's happening?
- The line is dead.
- Try again.
It's not working.
Satchel charge.
- What's happening here?
- Outside!
- Flare pistol.
- Sir.
Good try, sir.
- Seems to lost the old magic wand.
- Regroup now.
Heil Hitler!
- Colonel Harker.
- Craig.
- They're coming in.
- Get down to the beach!
They're gonna need all the help they can get.
Take cover!
Jerries!
Half-track! Open fire!
Get the bastards.
They're turning back.
- The Sergeant Major got through.
- Thank God.
Take cover under the cliffs!
Bloody tanks!
They would have chopped our barges to pieces.
Take a look!
We're just not going anywhere with those damn tanks out there.
They've pinned us here until their infantry moves in.
I think I can get up there, Colonel.
Still determined to be a martyr, aren't you?
I never did believe we'd get through this so long.
Besides, German hospitality does not appeal to me.
You pull those tanks... and I'll give you the fuel bunkers as a going-away present.
Best job I've had all day.
Krug.
I'll take three men.
The rest of you stay here with Major Craig.
Shalom!
Shalom, Captain.
I wish you luck, Bergman.
I mean it.
We're both going to need it, Colonel.
But don't steal any from mine.
I'm going back up!
Mazeltov.
Look!
They're coming down!
Watch out. Cover the rear!
All right lads, at the double!
- We gotta take that tank.
- My pleasure.
No, let me have that.
Need that tank operational.
Field knife.
- Grenade!
- Get out, get out!
Dig in!
Hard left, Sergeant! Take her through!
- 88 on the left.
- Lieutenant.
Ready.
Ready.
Hub station, off to the right.
They're at an impasse.
We'll hit the top level first.
Then work our way down.
Get us out of here, Sergeant, before we blow up with it!
Good lord!
They have blown the reserve.
With any luck...
We've seen the end of
Rommel's push to the Suez.
Colonel Harker.
Your continued resistance will only result in a futile loss of lives.
I ask you to surrender.
He knows your name, sir.
And our situation.
We've done what we set out to do.
Hands up.
Come on, quick.
Nobody move.
Whoever moves, dies.
My compliments, Colonel.
I have your assurance that our wounded..
...will receive prompt medical care?
The best we can provide.
As soon as you surrender the
Kesselring document, Colonel Harker.
Mohnfeld.
The name is Von Kroeger.
Von Kroeger, need I remind you of protocol?
This is an intelligence matter.
And it wasn't Bruckner.
What I told you was the truth, with one slight alteration.
That you found me in the tunnel.
The paper please.
As soldiers, we have few saving graces.
Perhaps our willingness to die for what we believe... is all that matters.
Draw...
...swords.
11th Hussars present and ready for your inspection, my lord.
I do not propose to recount my life in any detail what is what.
No damn business of anyone what is what.
I am Lord Cardigan. That is what.
Them Cherrybums, you see them tight,
I keep them tight.
10,000 a year out of my own pocket
I spend to clothe them.
A master cutler sharps their swords, and I keep them tight-stitched...
...cut to a shadow. Good.
If they can't fornicate, they can't fight...
...and if they don't fight hard,
I'll flog their backs raw...
...for all their fine looks.
Nolan. lt's Nolan.
There. Lewis!
Nolan!
He's seen us. l've not seen him for years, and yet it will be like yesterday. l hope l can love him as you do.
Dear friend!
-This is Clarissa?
-This is my dear Clarissa. l've landed two days.
We were handed letters at Aden.
You do scribble a lot, William.
Still, dear friend, l'm here. l am gazetted to the 11th Hussars, you know that.
My brother is to join the 11th Hussars,
Capt. Nolan. l'm playing the spy in Mufti. l've not joined yet, so l took the opportunity of a spy's eye at them.
Are they good, William?
They look good.
Cardigan has them looking good.
Yes, the mounts do look pretty dressed up.
Still...
...it is good to see you both, and here of all places. lt is good.
England is looking well.
-Fanny!
-Clarissa!
Ladies and gentlemen, l am sure you will all be very glad to join with me...
...in wishing the young couple long life...
...happiness, and all that they wish themselves.
Hear, hear.
The bride and bridegroom.
Young men of London, fall in and follow me, boys. lf you would not be starved by cruel masters...
...if you would not be ruled by anyone except the Queen, God bless her...
...but who do have the urge to seek wealth, fine clothes, and glory...
...you can do no better than to enlist...
...for the 11th Regiment of Hussars.
Culloden. Flanders. Salamanca. Waterloo.
An escort to Prince Albert on the occasion of his wedding...
...after which he called us his own.
God bless him.
Our dress is bright and warm.
Our mounts is mastered and mannered, gentle in ride and calm in battle.
Our officers just whisper.
They being of the opinion, like myself...
...that more can be done glorious by leading from the front...
...than can ever be brought off by prods up the arse from the rear.
Hold your head up, sir. l believe you would look a rare treat in stable dress.
-Are you respectable?
-l've often thought of enlisting. l thought you had, by the fine way you carry yourself. l'm a bad character, just out of jail. ln that case, you've already served Her Majesty.
Lord Cardigan's Cherrybums, follow me.
Keep yourselves clean, that's important.
You'll never want for money, and the glitter of a Hussar...
...is something l've seen the gay ladies pearling their eyes after.
Be obedient, be clean.
What is a pitfall is drink.
That will not concern me, for l do not drink.
What will concern you is, you'll never speak to an officer in that manner again.
Attention!
Scrub the scum clean.
Old Swaddy will settle you into your troop, show you the way of it.
Bossing your kit and being clean.
Right, strip off.
-What is the condition of them?
-They're all wobbly-boned.
Recruits in England are mostly wobbly and bad-formed.
There is no such thing as a wobbly officer.
What you sergeants never seem to understand...
...is the state of responsibility that an officer is in.
They worry. They hardly never wobble.
There is no place happier than a cavalry mess.
If one is a stupid, inconsiderate and lazy man...
...one can fit as a round peg into a snug round hole.
At times I am so pent up with their languor
I could grab of two of them...
...and bang their noddles together till their doodles drop off. l'm Codrington. l've come to join.
-Come to join, young fellow?
-Yes. Fond of riding are you?
-He's as green as grass.
-Or soon will be.
A fine growed-up fellow, though, with very neat feet.
Rupert.
You're a madman, sir.
And you are on your arse, sir. l'm thirsty. lt's the salt from the mutton.
-Have you got no money?
-l have none.
-ln your clothes.
-lt was....
-l did have money in my clothes.
-Did you? l'm out for a wet, a drop of beer.
Pongelow is the drink, they call it.
''How d'you think l paid her? l met her in the barracks yard...
''...and gently down l laid her.''
Private Metcalfe, for the wives.
Get back in there.
Lady Scarlett is giving a ball.
-Capt. Nolan.
-Lewis, how do you do?
Clarissa, Mrs. Morris, it is wonderful to have you back...
...you both back, it is wonderful. Come on. l danced as a boy on the eve of Waterloo.
-There was a war.
-That was a war. l don't think l belong, Duberly. l'm sure l do. Oh, l'm sure you do. l'm more a scientific poet.
-Scarlett.
-My lord.
All this swish and tit gets me sniffing nose up. l shall have to fetch it off tonight, Squire.
Had me Cherrybums out today, always makes me randified.
Duberly says he is despised by his officers and feared by his men.
Duberly says the 1 1th have become a laughing stock...
...for the shortness of their jackets and the tightness of their britches.
He says it is wicked, he commands over the heads of gifted officers...
...when he is such a blockhead.
They tell me that her pitcher has been too often to the well.
Duberly says I must stop looking at Lord Cardigan...
...as if I want to be ridden by him.
Duberly says he has left his wife...
...and is the most notorious casual person with women...
...immoral and licentious. l want to dance with Lord Cardigan more than anything else in the world. ls he not the very picture of the finest Englishman?
Has he not an exquisite head? l've just been introduced to
Squire De Burgh, charming fellow.
-l believe the next is a gallop.
-l believe it is. l don't have a programme. l don't gallop very well with ladies indoors, but may l have the honor?
-l shall be pleased.
-Excuse us.
You have a clever officer in Nolan,
Lord Cardigan.
He has written a book, which is not a diary but of a scientific nature.
-To do with soldiering.
-What, some damn novelist? l do envy soldiers' way.
What it must be to hunt one day and fight the next. ls war terrible? lt is the stuff. lt is the stuff we're all hoping for.
Soldiers do, Fanny, those that are waiting to use their talents.
What is most a talented officer should have? Courage and dash?
Some of that. A soldier should have some courage, of course.
Most of all, to know what is right.
Judgment, a feeling for decision.
A cavalry officer depends on the strike in his eye.
When and where to use it.
Comradeship. How high is that regarded in military things?
High. But true comrades are rare, like the truly loving wife is rare.
-William has talked of you constantly.
-l shall tell him to stop.
He says you are the finest horseman in England.
Does he say l'm the finest dancer? l'm not.
He goes further than that.
He says, probably in Europe, also.
He exaggerates.
William is indeed fortunate.
Are you happy to be a soldier's wife?
Should soldiers have wives, Capt. Nolan?
William should.
That's the Duke of Wellington's statue. lt was subscribed for by the whole nation, and now they don't know where to put it.
There is great concern.
-He was a fine soldier.
-So are you, l am told. l learned from a friend that you have a system. l'd like to write an article on you for the Times.
Come on, now!
That is Cardigan's system.
A shilling a man it costs him.
Can you beat that?
He reckons to train up a troop horse in less than 14 days, is his system.
-Capt. Nolan.
-And his system. l am not one of your new lights with tea and a Bible canteen. lt is not a revelation.
Both of you have plenty of it.
You, dear friend, l know, and you, Russell, l am sure. lt is, in a word, kindliness.
-How are you today, my beauty?
-She's very well, sir. Thank you, sir.
Pridmore. Dismount.
Prepare to mount. Mount.
Move like a Highgate whore, put some spring into your back.
You'll not learn nothing from watching this...
...but l should stay watching. l want you, what your name is, on the right.
Your name, on the right!
Do you not know your right?
You, on the right!
Where l'm pointing now!
You! l want you to watch this blade...
...for should it waver, slice it down fairly through my head...
...as hard as you can. Face front!
You've got no hooks on!
Sergeant, on the left.
Hooks is spurs.
-Name?
-Metcalfe.
You will wear your hooks at all times.
Sgt. Smith, what he is doing, don't look down...
...is marking you right from left.
He can read, so he knows his left from right.
What you've got there is a new foot...
...an army foot you've never had before. lt's like a foreign language to them.
They don't know any direction, back or front.
They'll never find their front when there isn't a black face to it. l always tell them, they'll know their front...
...from the many black nigger faces waving knives at them.
What we will do now is finding left.
Try it.
Try straw foot forward.
That officer....
Capt. Nolan, my lord.
Does that black savage belong to him?
Capt. Nolan has served in lndia and has an lndian servant.
That's no excuse.
Who are you, sir? l am Capt. William Morris of the 17th Lancers.
-Are you another of these damned lndians?
-He is an old-- lndia?
Don't tell me of lndia, you and your black rogue.
No use rubbing under it.
Officers who have served in lndia...
...are considered less worth than those who purchase their way...
...from one regiment to another. lt is, Nolan, at Kaffirs and savages you have put your men...
...which is something more than a round of drills.
You lndians are the only officers who led your men in war.
Listen, a linnet. lt is good to have you with us.
When you were away, you were in my thoughts every day. Wasn't he?
You were, indeed.
-You are both good friends now.
-William is very happy. l am.
We all are.
He does love you dearly.
-Are we now to become horse marines?
-We are.
''For thy smile would make a summer
''Where darkness else would be
''For thy smile could make a summer
''Where darkness else would be''
One, two, three, four.
Who gave you permission to dismount?
One, two...
...three, four.
Sahib mighty good horsemen, both Sahibs.
You're all a-bleeding-sleep! Left leg over.
Do you have a hunter for rides in the morning? l am fond of riding.
Warsham! Bring our new friend, Newboy.
Now, this is a thoroughly useful animal.
Brother!
You stupid, drunken cad.
You've nothing but a queer upbringing amongst cattle and bad practice.
-Rupert.
-All right.
Damn you, if you want to get shot off.
Gently.
Steady now.
Walk on, now.
Trot on.
Gently.
Xenephon's words should be painted on every stable end:
''Horses are not taught by harshness but by gentleness.''
For classical officers like Mogg here...
...the inscription should, of course, be in Greek.
-Mogg!
-Sir. l will not have an officer of mine shown up by an lndian wretch.
He made a monkey of you, sir.
-That man.
-Sir.
That man has not watered his horse.
Tell him to water his mount...
...straight off before the bridle is off so that he cools off. Tell him!
Tell him l shall take orders from a man, not a monkey.
''For those that wander
''They know not where
''Full of trouble and full of care
''To stay at home
''To stay at home is best''
Oh! l daresay, yes, for a soldier, some song.
You'll have to find an appointment out of reach of Lord Cardigan and his regiment.
He is a dangerous man.
He will see you broken, it's his practice.
-lt is a fine regiment.
-Yes, it is a fine regiment.
Fanny, hello. l promised to help her school her bob.
You must be aware of my regard for you.
Yes, of course. lt would be an offence between us if l denied it.
Looking everywhere.
-Clarissa, l--
-You won't go.
No, please pay me no attention. lt would hurt William if you were to leave.
Come here. l don't say it lightly or easily.
Not look.
Not hear. lt is not easy, Clarissa.
No. lt is the Lordship's command that only champagne be served in the mess tonight.
Are you cosseted, young man? l have your orders, my lord...
...to be here and eat lettuce. l am eating lettuce. l have eaten lettuce.
What it tells, my lord, is that as youngest officer...
...you will expect him to eat as a rabbit does, only lettuce. lt is signed by you, my lord.
So green, boy, you have been drawn.
Not my order, you should eat lettuce...
...though perhaps it will put some sap in your pizzle.
Does this tomfoolery make officers?
Perhaps, but it makes comrades.
Do you think we could have some Moselle,
Nolan?
-Of course. A bottle of Moselle, please.
-Thank you.
We always depend upon being seen to do our duty. l know if l'm up to something glorious in the field, l insist upon being seen.
There ain't much point, otherwise.
-What color is the Russian enemy?
-Sneaky color.
Gray. Your Russian is gray, which is why he can't be seen...
...which is why his promotion is slow.
There ain't one above a corporal in the whole lot...
...which is why we will cut 'em up.
With a little breeding, an Englishman can buy his advancement.
He and l are not able to buy our advancement.
We've had to obtain it by our abilities.
No use decanting it.
You can leave it on the table.
Thank you.
Couleur de Noir.
You are drinking beer, sir, porter beer.
-No, my lord.
-Yes.
-No.
-See it.
No, my lord.
Don't you ''no'' me. That is a black bottle. l assure you, my lord.
That is a black bottle, and you are drinking porter from it.
Champagne only. ln point of fact, l asked Capt. Nolan--
-You knew that!
-l am not aware. l am aware you are drinking porter at my table.
Sit down, Capt. Nolan.
Sit down, Featherstonehaugh.
What his Lordship said was that champagne only would be drunk...
...in the mess tonight. What he said.... lt is not porter, it is Moselle, my lord.
Apologize. lf l am in error--
Error? Don't quibble with me, sir. Beer. l will not have beer drunk in my mess.
Come back, Nolan.
Nolan, you will not leave the mess. Dog!
Devil upstart. lmpertinent lndian dog devil.
As President of the Mess Committee, what Cardigan would have me say is...
...you are guilty of disorderly behavior.
What you should consider in the future...
...is that the mess should be conducted like a gentleman's table...
...not a common ale house with black bottles.
That is an offensive thing to have to say...
...to have said, one officer to another, in front of brother officers.
Do you not know that, unlike a farmer, a gentleman decants his Moselle?
He doesn't drink it like beer. lf you cannot behave like a gentleman, you are to leave the regiment.
Will you shake hands with me, sir?
-There is no quarrel between us.
-You will. l will not, my lord.
-You flagrantly insult this officer.
-No insult is intended to this officer.
Shake hands, damn you.
You shall be arrested.
Why shall l be arrested? l shall have you arrested.
You are arrested.
Go to your quarters, sir, and be arrested.
Have you seen the Times this morning, Raglan? l have seen the Times, Airey.
''Black bottle.'' l'm very worried about the British army when it gets into the newspapers.
Whatever Lord Cardigan does is public news within an hour.
-lt is unfitting.
-''Black bottle.''
-What?
-What is shouted at him when he goes out? lt do bring the army up for snooks, you know.
Vulgar things.
Shouldn't say these vulgar things at him, Airey.
But what can we do?
Where are they going to put that statue, Airey? lt can't stay there, to be enjoyed by me alone.
They won't leave it there.
They don't know where to put it. lt's very much in my light for paperwork, Airey. l wish they'd take it away.
You and l are always of the custom, when in difficulty, to ask ourselves...
...how the great Duke would have acted and decided in similar circumstances.
We are. l am. l will.
He was surely right that when there is danger...
...it is the persons with a stake in the country, land, position, wealth...
...that are best able to able to defend it. l am an old man, Airey...
...and l've only got one arm to fight the war with. lt won't be enough.
Duberly says it's going to be war.
He says the Russians will fight...
...and the Prime Minister is faced towards peace, but carried towards war.
Duberly says l can go with the army. l can go, Duberly says, as a wife, which l am. lsn't it exciting?
-William wants to go.
-Soldiers will.
''Answer me to what l ask you.''
''Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten her nine farrow.''
''Come, high or low.
''Thyself and office deftly show!''
''He knows thy thought.
''Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
''Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
''Beware Macduff.''
Lewis is arrested over the black bottle. lt is sure. He is under arrest.
-Nolan?
-lt may be the end of his career.
-Mr. De Burgh, how do you do?
-Without you, sir.
Being under arrest, is it certainly the finish of his career as a soldier? lt is serious. lt is a serious thing for an officer.
There's Lord Cardigan.
Late for the play. Going to the war.
Black bottles!
Shall we go and boo him?
-Black bottles!
-Sit still before l hit you, girl. l'll form a picket. Come on, Henry.
Present me as a picket come to get the black bottle from the horse's mouth.
What black bottle?
My wife, Mrs. Duberly.
She's been enquiring after Capt. Nolan.
Under arrest, that man. l have placed him under arrest. lndeed, my lord. On what crime?
Failing to behave like a gentleman and turning the mess...
...into a disorderly house with black bottles.
We must go, Clarissa. l'll find out about Nolan.
Duberly never tells me anything.
Company, attention!
-Sergeant Major.
-Sir. ls he shaping? l would put him forward as a good clean man.
-Could he take the trumpet?
-That will be a good step for him.
Good. Something for you, Sergeant Major.
Carry on polishing, men.
-Sergeant Major.
-Sir. l want a report of any conversation
Capt. Nolan has with other officers.
You are to take note of whatever he might say and bring the information to me.
-l shall spy, my lord?
-You shall.
My lord....
To be asked to take up the spy.... l am much distressed to be asked such a thing, my lord.
After 20 years of coming up from private trooper...
...and keeping off the pongelow...
...not a drop since corporal. l shall inform Capt. Nolan. l can hardly do other.
Sergeant Major, it is better that you take a ball and put it in your own brain.
You are finished now, as if you had not ever been made.
What a waste.
Your duties!
Main guard present and correct, sir.
Stable guard present and correct, sir.
Number 1 squadron, present and correct, sir.
Straw foot, right foot.
Staff parade.
Ready, present for inspection, sir. ls he drunk?
-Sergeant Major.
-Yes.
This is all according to the articles of war.
I was drunk at my post.
It is not my place to criticize.
But it will have a grave effect on the noncommissioned officers...
...for it will show there is a slender thread.
One slip, and a soldier is deprived...
...of what has taken years of steady effort to obtain.
-Permission to carry on, sir.
-Farriers, do your duty.
One...
...two...
...three...
...four...
...five...
...six...
...seven...
...eight...
...nine...
...ten...
...eleven...
-Stand still and be quiet!
-...thirteen...
...fourteen....
Always one or two of your younger tyro officers brings up or flops over.
Faints away like lily at bedtime.
The time should be past when such treatment is inflicted on a British soldier.
They will not fight unless they are flogged to it.
Would you ask that of them?
Would you ask they fight like fiends of hell for money or ideas?
That would be unchristian.
...forty nine...
...fifty.
Punishment completed, sir.
Unfasten.
What will you do now, Sgt. Major? l doubt if he'll have a pension now...
...and that worries me. l shall continue in the service, though no pension.
Shall you enlist as a private in some other regiment...
...and hope to make your rank again? l shall, sir. l am too humbled to stay in the 11th. lt is humbling. l have had some humbling.
You can't avoid it.
There is no making without breaking.
-My lord, l must protest.
-Nolan, we don't flog officers.
-Am l still under arrest, my lord?
-You would prefer that you are released? l do not wish to be released from arrest. l wish for a court-martial...
...that l may state some things of how you asked my fellow officers to spy on me.
You lie, sir. lt is you who spy.
Are spying up against me.
You shirk your duties, sir. l can hardly shirk my duties if l am not under command, but arrested.
You lying scoundrel. lndian rogue.
You will not have a court-martial.
You were born dishonored and a lie, and you will die in lies.
Come back here! l have not finished with you.
Try not to hit him, Nolan.
We must remember our rank.
You blackguard, what do you whisper? l am ashamed that you are not polite to our rank. We are your own officers.
Officer? Paymaster Duberly!
That ain't a rank, it's a trade.
One day, there will be an army where troopers need not be forced to fight...
...by floggings and hard reins.
An army...
...a Christian army, that fights because it is paid well to fight...
...and fights well because its women and children are cared for...
...an army that is efficient and of a professional feather.
I must fight for such an army.
Dear friend.
That army will bring the first of the modern wars...
...and the last of the gallop.
-lt does look like war.
-Does it? l do think the French have been asking for it for some time...
...ever since they had my arm.
But it won't be the French this time, will it?
Won't it be the French? l've got a map somewhere of who it ought to be.
-Will you see Capt. Nolan, 11th Hussars?
-Yes.
Well, it might be the French, it might always be the French. l knew it would be.
Nolan, Capt. Nolan, sir.
-Have you got a map?
-My lord, may l ask--
Speak up, he's a bit deaf when he's thinking, and that statue doesn't help.
My lord.
You're the chap.
You've been shouting at Lord Cardigan.
Calling him things.
You've put the army in the newspapers.
My lord, l request the privilege of being granted a court-martial.
Perhaps they could put it over one of the new railway stations.
Court-martial? My dear Capt. Nolan.
Well, what can we do about it?
You're becoming a laughing stock, gentlemen.
You're appearing far too frequently in the newspapers. ln the case of Capt. Nolan, now...
...Lord Raglan refuses his request for a court-martial...
...that it might be prejudicial to the good of the service and cause public disquiet.
-Gen. Airey, l--
-lf you persist in this matter...
...you will forfeit the sympathy of every officer of rank in the service.
As for the conduct of Lord Cardigan...
...Lord Raglan expects that in the future his lordship will exercise the forbearance...
...and discretion befitting an officer and a gentleman.
We are being taken towards war by popular fervor.
There is no reason for war, there is no real understanding of the issues...
...because there are hardly any issues involved.
Let us not pretend that Christian England can find common ground...
...with infidel Turkey against Christian Russia.
''Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.''
Restrain yourselves, my friends. Peace.
Peace, my brethren.
Restrain yourselves, my friends.
-So excited.
-Yes.
Everybody is so excited. l'm not excited. ls it such an exciting thing to do?
Yes, it is the most exciting thing in the world.
Perhaps there is no other life for a man, is there, Lewis?
No, there is not.
How sad.
-Why sad?
-Because it all ends in death.
-l will not have you thinking of death.
-No. l don't know what has made me think of death.
War has made her think of death. l do believe it has.
Dear Clarissa, it is inevitable.
Until such savages are sufficiently civilized to understand...
...and abide by decisions arrived at by arbitration...
...we will have, we must have, war.
Yes.
Now, l feel l should propose a toast or something of the kind.
-l'm not sure what.
-Not the Crimea.
No.
Lewis, what about you?
Your new appointment.
No.
No?
The three of us.
To the three of us.
Lewis.
-l am with child.
-You are. l didn't know.
William has been longing to tell you. l am so unhappy.
No. You should both of you be happy. lt is a happy thing. l beg you not to entertain any thoughts other than....
They're there, Lewis, like unwelcome guests.
No, not unwelcome, welcome.
Please take my hand. l long for it to be yours.
My dear, l must join William. lt is some madness in you that has infected us all. l shall not be the same from knowing you, nor William either.
When you are with him, there....
Remember, my heart is....
-Lord Lucan.
-Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Don't treat me as if l was a child, sir.
Sebastopol.... Now what is it?
-Lord Lucan.
-Lord Raglan.
Good, good. We have some things.
Do l get command?
You?
Control of the Mediterranean.
That's what the Czar's at, and then afterwards lndia, and he will have war.
The Duke of Wellington always thought of you highly...
-...found you very qualified, Lucan.
-He is.
That is fact.
To do it stylish and sicken the Czar...
...we are to put Sebastopol to the flames, and that is our intention. ls there something for Scarlett to have? l think Scarlett should have something. l'll tell him he'll have something, but you don't know what.
-l do know what.
-Am l to have the army, or am l not?
Not. l have the army. l will command the expedition myself.
Of course you will. l would. lt is my earnest hope that you will consent to assume command of the cavalry.
Very well.
What is Scarlett to have, Airey?
Scarlett will have the Heavy Brigade and Lord Cardigan, the Light Brigade.
Cardigan? The Light Brigade?
That damned never-out brother-in-law of mine.
You threaten me with Cardigan? l'll not have him or his red-shanked ridgebacks under my command. l'll not command him.
Capt. Nolan's reporting, sir, though his regiment is about to sharpen...
...l have persuaded him there is duty and honor for him with us. l'm sure you will see that there is much to be gained...
...by an amicable settlement of any difference...
...between you and Lord Cardigan, for the good of your country.
Then make it known to that empty-headed muff of a brother of mine, that Brudenell...
...that l command the cavalry, and l command him.
Tell the fool, in simple manner that he'll understand, he is under my command.
Of course.
-You've got Sebastopol.
-l don't want any damned Sebastopol.
-But l was shown it on the map.
-l told you. No damned Sebastopol.
Sir Colin Campbell, Highland Brigade.
Gen. Scarlett, Heavy Brigade.
Sir Richard England, Third lnfantry division.
Sir John Burgoyne,
Superintendent Royal Engineers. l came to be offered a command.
Not serve under that fool, Lucan. l knew...
...the moment l saw his biscuit face sopping up wet around the horse guards...
...he'd be here, starting his wheedling. l'm sure that after a little while,
Lord Cardigan...
...you may be persuaded such an arrangement may be made to work.
After all, you will have the Light Brigade.
Dash and fire, eh?
Yes, Cardigan, you'll have the Light
Brigade. Dash and fire it is.
Lucan couldn't make himself fit to command a tent. Command an escort.
Not fit to command a troop of knackered tailors on stubbed donkeys.
Airey, those two, don't let them sit together.
We must do what we can to keep them apart.
Things are serious and they are silly in ways.
-My lord.
-Lord Raglan.
Sit down, gentlemen.
War. This is war, gentlemen.
Our passage to lndia is threatened, l should think. Wouldn't you?
The honor, the reputation, the glory of England is threatened...
...and the Queen's majesty is sure to be threatened, she is. lf poor, brave, weak little, sick little Turkey....
''The sick man of Europe.''
Yes, though l prefer to consider her as a young lady, hands up, flutter...
...defenseless. lf she should fall to the tyrant.... lf the Turks go down like cards, flip-flop...
...then next up our own Solent...
...and our own Queen, will come the Russians, ships and guns...
...to rip our country into shame.
The Russians. The Russians.
The Russians. The Russians.
The Russians.
Poor little Turkey.
Poor little Turkey!
Attention for Mr. Cornet Codrington, the orderly officer.
Me darlin' soldier, wait till l kiss you clean.
Are they winking at you, sir?
Permission to speak, sir.
Mrs. Mitchell, sir.
Are all the wives going, sir, or just a few? l'm strong, sir.
And so am l. l can't say. l really can't say.
One in six, sir.
One in six?
You look tremendous.
This is the beginning of a very long test, my dear William. l see you have your cattle slung aboard. l must watch for old Treasurer, that he is handled gently. l have a letter of importance for you, but orders are not to be read...
...until we up anchor. lmpressed on me, from Clarissa.
Where's Lord Cardigan?
Get into line, Lord Cardigan.
Light Brigade, with me.
What?
Trooper!
Pull those ropes faster.
Soldier!
Tomorrow, Calamita Bay. ls it aptly named, do you think, William? l know you worry about my rheumatism. lt is gone, almost gone.
-l wish l could come with you.
-We're going to swim and things.
But Henry, l can swim.
When we're settled, l'll see that you're rowed ashore.
Dear husband, kiss.
Dear wife, kiss.

Part V
Now we're in their land.
What shall we do?
We've very little choice.
Either to run across or...
Pass those lights?
What else?
Just 30 seconds... to get that sentry off our backs!
Kaji... shoot him from here!
Then you start running.
It's a good idea, but...
What about me?
Is there any alternative way?
Why don't you sneak up from behind and stab him?
What shall we do?
What are you doing?
Don't worry about me. Start running!
You're bloody!
Shooting a Russian soidier in the battle, was just one fire among millions, which share the guilt of killing people.
But... this morning...
Michiko... I'm a murderer!
These hands which have once... fondled your charms... have killed a man!
For the sake of crossing a mere road in safety!
Was I justified?
Or was it wanton murder?
Michiko! Tell me which is right?
Hon Sup. Pvt.!
How did you do it?
Don't ask me a stupid question.
Anyway, we've come this far.
Concentrate on what's coming!
Where to?
To Mutankiang... we hope.
It's that way.
But it'll be no use.
The Reds took it.
Oh? How about yourself?
Korea... that's where I'm heading.
It's closer to home.
What's your unit?
I had one until yesterday.
Beware the border area.
It's Commie territory.
Is that so?
Well... I'll just be another Red.
What's "comrade" in their lingo?
"Tonzu" in Chinese.
"Dommu," I think in Korean.
"Tonzu" and "dommu", eh? Thanks!
That's all I need. Good luck!
"Tonzu and "dommu", eh?
Bye-bye, dear tonzu!
A real crackpot!
Probably a deserter!
Should've asked his name.
What for?
To report him!
Silly!
You're saying I'm a fool?
I let you take charge only because you know this area.
I'm still the NCO here!
While I'm here, I give orders!
Forget your rank!
Listen carefully to what I say.
You, too, Terada!
Mutankiang is in enemy hands.
Our Kwantung Army is finished.
It's no use trying to rejoin them now.
Then what shall we do?
We return to our former lives!
We go this way!
That's where my life is.
I'll do my best to restore you to your former way of life.
If you don't agree with me, leave me... we're parting company here!
We might find our army.
You can join them if you like.
It's our duty to join them!
Kaji! It's an army rule.
We're defeated men now.
If you want to fight on, take Terada and go!
I'm going my way!
Kaji, will we make it?
Nothing but dense woods!
Two full days!
We have no maps, nor compass.
We must press on!
Our only hope!
We're on enemy terrain!
Must be a river.
River!
We're helped.
Like meeting Buddah in Hades!
We're saved! I can feed my baby again.
Do you realize... we haven't eaten in 5 days?
Help yourself to this.
What do you think?
Must we take them?
I'm undecided.
We can't leave them.
Our rations are low.
I'll keep it.
Who's a hog?
I won't say... but you can guess!
Well these men gave this to us to share it! Not only to you.
Have you ever brought any food to share?
Useless scum!
Making passes at the men.
We shared with you at the cost of my baby's milk.
Harlots!
So what?
We'll go ask the soldiers.
They won't share with us because we're harlots.
The filthy curs!
Those girls brought nothing to share in common.
You begged us when the Reds were raping your women!
Enough!
We all share alike.
Any more trouble and we leave you!
I wish I had a rice cake... as big as a women's ass!
Even cold rice and soup will do.
Oh, for a belly full!
Will you men stop raving about food?
Yeah, it just makes me feel hungrier.
Kaji! Aren't these edible?
They're snails!
Mmm... great!
Women, it may not be beef but at least we can get it down.
He's right! maybe we should try some of it.
It's the Kwangtung Army's fault!
Those arrogant parlor soldiers!
Hey, we did our best!
Only 3 of us survived... out of the original 160 men.
They could have evacuated the women and children.
We always co-operated with them.
At great profit to you?
You should gripe!
Please! Shut that brat up!
Get some sleep! No use griping.
Mommy!
Lay off those!
Play with them and you're dead!
You men have it easy. No children!
They walk too fast for us.
Soldiers... you'll never find paradise on this earth.
Is that my fault?
In Kaji's pouch... there remains a bit of paradise!
- What happened to the others?
- Who cares?
They're constantly slowing our pace.
Kaji... let's boil the rice and eat.
No! Not until we find our way out.
Or... when we're all ready to die!
All right? Come on!
You waited for us?
I like your guts!
Well, if we lose you... we're dead!
Come along... don't lose heart.
I won't let you die alone.
Forgive our slow pace.
Age can be an insurmountable barrier.
We'll keep walking until it's all over.
I'll always be with you.
It's all of us who are starved!
My baby is starving!
Even my husband is about finished!
So are we all.
Just a little, please!
For my baby and husband.
I won't touch it.
No!
Make do with what you can find.
My baby's dying!
The ones who survives... eats this rice. It's not for the dying.
You mean you're the one who will eat it?
If we're not out of here tomorrow we'll be dead anyway!
Live if you want to eat! Now, sleep!
Somebody... help!
My baby! My baby!
What'll I do?
My baby is dead! Dead!
Help me, someone!
Call a doctor!
Shut up! we're all dying.
How about your husband?
Pipe down! You drive me nuts!
Let her cry it out.
Let's go.. or we'll all die!
Get up... hurry! We mustn't stay here.
Will you shut up!
Too bad!
There goes our next meal.
Some marksman!
I'm sorry! My eyes are falling.
Where's the others?
The elder told us to go ahead.
They suddenlly doubled up in pain.
And they vomited blood.
Mushrooms?
If you want to die, use my rifle!
Who else ate the stuff?
They did! And it looked so good.
We've had enough of you.
Leave us to die in peace!
Let me bury the child.
He's dead!
And you killed him!
How many died today!
Where's your family?
What is it to you?
Nothing... I just asked.
Put them out of misery, that's what!
Seems there were other who were lost.
I won't give up!
Can we make it?
We'll see tomorrow morning.
We caught them. One is ours!
No! We share equally.
Don't try to pull rank on us.
You failed to shoot the bird.
We get one snake.
Go ahead... I'll shoot you.
Don't think you're the only one who can shoot.
Stop it!
Don't behave like little kids.
She's right!
What's got into us?
Kaji... we'll share the snake if you'll ration the rice.
Wait till tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow...
Will we get out?
I don't know.
You know how I feel?
When my unit was wiped out...
I survived the shootings.
I think my luck is going to hold.
Then... if I stick to you, will I get out, too?
It's one way of looking at it.
Wherever you go,
I'll always be with you.
Let's hope for tomorrow.
How are things down in the south?
I've a sister there.
My only living kin...
And she's not the kind of women I've become.
Are you going there?
Will you take me?
I hope they're safe!
They must be safe!
That's all the rice I have.
I'm breaking out of here at all cost!
I refuse to stop till I get it.
Stick with me.
Damn!
He's a fast walker!
I'd stick if I weren't injured.
Kaji, you once called me an idiot.
I won't forget it.
You saved me from the tanks.
I won't forget it.
Are you man or beast?
Damn it!
That bastard!
Where does that cur get all his energy, anyway?
Damn! I'll be eternally disgraced...
A full Corporal taking orders from a Private!
Oh... I should've died a hero's death in battle.
I'd be deified and having it easy.
The idiot!
We'll never make it out of these woods.
Help will come to us.
Why should we keep walking? I quit!
How are you, Chief?
I think he's leading us in the wrong direction.
This leads us to Vladivostok.
I've given up.
I'm quitting!
Get up!
Ume-chan... Ume!
I can still walk.
But... where does all this lead?
All this walking...
Is it worth the trouble?
The southern border might be... another mass grave for the Japanese.
We probably have no place to go or to live.
Wait! Don't kill her.
I'm coming back... to face charges.
Michiko!
Are you still alive?
Can you imagine what
I'm going through... to return to your side?
Will we find our way out today?
Terada!
Look! Do you see it?
What do think?
A dwelling?
Or other humans.
Someone lives there!
It's too early to rejoice yet.
Let's wait for the others.
Remnants of Ushijima Unit?
Yes, sir!
From the Doi group?
Yes sir!
The Ushijumi Battalion was wiped out.
What about Lt. Doi?
Dead sir.
Why are you alive?
Why didn't you fight on?
You dare live with your commander dead?
Must be deserters!
And women! What does this mean? Explain yourself!
No, I won't. All we want is food.
Never! We can't spare it.
After reaching the Korean border, we are making our last stand.
We've got no food for cowards.
Get out!
Move on or we'll hang you all!
Captain Nagata, eh?
Keep your bloody supplies!
I'll blow your head off! Don't move!
Don't move!
Terada... shoot if they make a move.
Damned parlor soldiers in dress uniforms!
Why don't you say you just want to keep your supplies?
You ran off with your supplies, leaving us to be wiped out!
Kaji... while we were at it, we should have filched some supplies.
Hell with supplies! That dog!
Corporal Hironaka, those are the men you wanted to join.
What a filthy man!
Someone comes!
Nice work, Kaji.
Remember me?
Tange?
Yes... I'm Tange.
You scared the hell out of me.
You look tough with those whiskers.
You've certainly changed!
Kill or be killed... we'll talk about that later.
Eat some of this.
Was the war over?
It must be.
If so, what will be the outcome?
Like Germany...
Unconditional surrender!
Yes.
But after that... what about us? what happens to the people?
The big question.
Defeat... means national collapse?
What is the nation?
The country you knew will be dead.
It should be.
We've been struggling to survive.
How to give birth to the country where men are free?
That's the question.
I hope democratic forces will unite... to cope with this defeat.
Japan has such forces?
They're mostly helpless creatures like myself.
They're no use.
Why so cynical?
The test is to come.
Beside the point.
We entered military service... and fought in battle.
Wiped out... and trudging aimlessly on.
Killers who failed our buddies.
How many of us are qualified for coping with defeat?
That enough!
Even your ideas seem distorted.
Hey I found one!
A corn field!
Fast asleep.
He seems greatly relieved since you joined us.
He had it rough.
But you... a woman... how'd you manage to do it? I'm amazed!
I just keep on going.
How often I thought I wouldn't make it!
But he was much nicer than he looks.
And I wanted to see my sister.
- Where is she?
- In Taishihkiao.
It's near Kaji's place?
Yes, that's why I'm with him.
We don't have to worry about food.
There's plenty.
Stop that!
Stand up!
We mean you no harm.
We just ask you our way
Have any Russians come this way yet?
Dog! He's pretending to be deaf.
We only wish to return home.
Which way is Jinpohu?
Thank you.
Damn! We've been tricked.
That cur! Should've shot him!
We raid their fields. So they hate us.
Strange! How come they're armed?
Taken from our troops?
They must have formed their own militia.
Come on. Let's run away.
There's no retreat now.
We're pushing on.
Hi! You're just on time.
Our scouts blundered and things are a bit nasty.
Front line unit?
Remnants of...
That's great!
What do you think of this plan?
While they search for us over there, you cover us from here... and we'll make those woods.
And then... we'll cover you from there
Sounds good.
But not for us.
Why is that?
How are your scouts?
See where those men are?
They got it there...
You shut up!
You didn't help?
How could we? Not enough men!
Then you might desert us, too?
You'll stay here with me.
My men will go first.
If you agree to this, we'll cooperate with you.
You don't trust us?
Wait! Why not wait till dark?
There's no time.
They've already spotted us here.
He's right.
Re-tie your laces!
Fire at random! Pin 'em down!
Come on! It's our turn.
- Does it hurt?
- Just a scratch.
Damn! I'm dead tired.
Poor Ujiie! They got him.
Killed?
Having a field day!
They formed militia...
The war must be over.
If so there'd be proclamations urging our surrender.
How come they are just trying to kill us?
Would you surrender?
Afraid not.
Yeah! P.O.W. has no freedom.
We may be paying dearly for our worthless freedom.
Blast it! It's getting cold.
If you listened to me, we'd be sitting pretty by this time.
The closer we come to town, the more intimidated he is.
We don't have to be so afraid of armed Chinese.
You okay?
Yes, except for the shivering.
How's your leg?
A bit painful... that's all.
I've come to realize how nice it is to have shelter.
I never realized before... but now I understand.
Know what I mean?
It's so nice to have a home... for protection from the rain.
Michiko.
Such fleeting happiness!
For the joys we shared... at the cost of Chinese sacrifices.
I am now paying dearly.
And I must kill and steal... or I cannot fight my way back to you.
Michiko, Is a new life possible for us?
Can we start anew?
No village in sight.
Strange! But shall we rest here?
Such pigs!
Someone lives here.
There's no threat.
A roof overhead, at least!
We'll stop here for rest.
Great! I'll grab the pig.
Aroma of steaming fat reminds of that Russian place.
What a joint! It was great!
Honey... and as much meat as you want!
Female flesh, too!
This wretch!
The gal had her legs spread... and he stands shaking.
You lucky dog!
About this time, we were eating snails in the woods.
Enough of that!
Touch another women and your dead!
Why not the white and Chinese dames?
They're raping our women!
It's war! Eye for an eye!
These eggs obviously don't know me!
I can guess.
Well, stop being a square each passing day of your lifetime.
A horrible wound!
It's healed now.
Kaji cleaned it out with gunpowder.
Kaji did it?
Hey, shall I wash your body?
- Pretty ass!
- Get away from me!
Must be itching by now!
It's a baffling.
A true oasis for those of us rejected by society.
Let's go out. Too dark in here.
Get the men! We're moving on.
Danger is everywhere.
Let them relax a bit.
Am I too harsh?
You tend to drag others up to the level of your own ability.
That's how you are...
Of course, that's probably why you're alive today.
We move on!
Go away! I'm shedding!
I'm all for it.
Never seen a naked woman?
You must haven't made love for so long.
How about with me?
Not with you!
You have nothing to lose... even if I can't pay you.
Come on! How about it?
Touch me and I'll yell!
Put on your clothes!
You're too careless.
Mind your own affairs, Hon. Private!
Now move. We're leaving!
I'll listen to your excuse later.
Stop teasing the men!
I'm not teasing.
Once your out of danger, you're so easy to be careless.
What does it mean?
To hell with you!
I prefer him to you.
So what?
Just remember... danger lurks.
You could bring us trouble.
I'll not trouble you anymore.
Hey, stop it!
The dog! He was spying on us.
Maybe he lives here. We ate his pig.
Good for you.
If I hadn't been crapping out there, we'd be in hot water now.
You live here?
I'm sorry we killed your pig.
What nonsense you're talking!
Break the wall.
They're coming!
Hurry up!
Will Kaji make it?
What'll we do if he doesn't?
We'll make out. He's no god himself.
We know our way around, too.
As of now, I quit running... and start fighting.
Kill us if they want!
But why non-combatants?
Women?
We're all on edge.
That's no reason!
Such logic justifies nothing.
His guts were hanging out.
I finished him.
The dogs! Did a horrible thing to her.
Where's the men?
Out there somewhere. Go find them.
I'll bury the girl.
- I'll bury the others.
- The Manchu?
Any objections?
If you're burying the girl, you can also bury the Manchus.
But I'll do it for you.
I wish we could keep going under cover.
If they spot us, it will be the end.
Here they come.
Don't rush. They're too far.
There must be others. What'll we do?
Can't let our goose be cooked too.
Let's hurry along.
What a pillage job!
No wonder we're unwelcome.
But we can't die because of their guilt.
Damn! This is getting serious.
What shall we do? We're surrounded.
Can't budge!
We did no damage!
You didn't?
Kaji! We see smoke from the rear.
Let's run for it.
It's no use.
They'll get us as we come out.
It's time to give up.
Let's surrender.
Fool!
Surrender without firing a shot?
They don't want us alive... just dead!
That's why they caught fire.
Team up, men! We're going.
There's the fire line! It's safest!
Terada, come!
A narrow escape!
We'll wait till dawn.
We made it but
I don't approve of your methods.
Lost another man.
Meaning Hironaka?
I'm not blaming you.
I understand.
When we reach the railroad, we'll learn the truth.
We'll part there.
Japanse refugees!
Looks like they're mostly women.
Should we call?
Wait! Let's wait a bit longer.
What is it?
Don't look!
I can't believe it!
The Red army wouldn't rape...
Only Japanese women.
When prison conveys pass, the sight is really sickening.
Any women will do!
Women in defeat are doomed!
There must be knaves in even the Red Army.
One in millions!
But existence of a few proves nothing.
It doesn't underestimate the theory of the Red... no... People's army.
A flaw of the transition period.
It will soon be corrected.
The Red Army must be different from the Japanese Army in Nazi.
Not even like the Americans!
Minor facts ignored in history. can be important to the individual.
He who has such failings can never erase it out of the memory.
The blood of hate will continue to seep from the wounds.
A breeding ground of distrust.
The insult to humanity...
How do you defend it?
Are Reds down south like that, too?
I have faith.
Hon. soldiers-
Are you headed south?
We we're visiting our uncle when the hostiles broke out.
And your parents?
I don't know.
Going to Korea?
No, back to Peihutow.
Though we're not sure what we'll find there.
Will you take as far as the lake?
How old are you?
Eighteen.
We're fast walkers.
We'll keep up. We did this far.
Had any trouble en-route?
We had geisha girls with us.
They sacrificed themselves.
And... they?
They took them away.
They said that kid went off his rocker.
Saw them raping his sister.
Enough!
I'm sorry!
Resting so often for our sake.
Takes good care of you, eh?
He'll revive when we're home.
I can't let anything happen before I return him to our parents.
Feels great! Try it.
Not like me, at all!
That's better! Fine!
Junpohu very far off?
Very near now.
Just follow this road.
We're you heading for?
We're going back to Korea.
Excuse me...
Is Peihutow still safe?
I come from a village some distance away. I can't tell you.
I think they evacuated.
All Japanese farmers... have left the sectors already.
Follow the lake from here and you'll find Peihutow.
Yes... for some 20-odd miles.
Can you make it by yourselves?
Yes, we'll be all right.
I've been thinking about what that Korean told us.
Even if you return there, you'll find your mother and father gone.
It may be unwise for you to go.
If you have no place to go, you can come with me.
Then you could contact your parents.
Or return to Japan.
Isn't that wiser?
I will keep on.
If... if my parents are gone, there's still our Chinese friends.
I'll escort them.
How about it? Let's see them home.
Okay, sister?
I'm sick of walking.
We'll rest awhile and consider our future.
But.. what if they're gone?
Well... we'll join the guerrillas.
Make her our leader.
They're walking fast.
They're in a hurry.
But Hon. Squad Leader... what if there's no one there?
Don't worry! Just leave it to me.
The witch! What a tempting body!
Strange...
They've been after us with fire and anti-tank guns... and over look spots like this.
It's paradise!
Hi, buddy! What unit?
Border unit.
Damn! We lost the war?
The big brass dragged us out to this Hell-hole!
They should take care of us to get out.
You may be right.
But they're all prisoners or have returned to Japan.
But we've lost...
The Americans taking Japan and the Russians taking Manchuria?
No, the Soviets will not.
They will return to Chaing Kai-shek?
Maybe... at least they'll be Chinese.
The Russians wants nothing.
Their sole aim has always been liberation of China.
You mean... the Reds did all that for nothing?
Tange
The liberation... how will they go about accomplishing it?
Chinese Communists...
Through revolution.
Civil war?
You guys communists?
Why don't you go to the Russians with your tails wagging?
We have no tails!
Fake commies, eh?
That's better! Be careful.
It' cold outside! Like winter.
Boy, were we happy when we saw this place from the woods!
Making a final stand there?
Plenty of supplies! What's the plan?
Hikita.. where'd you leave that girl?
Where'd they go?
We took her to the hill overlooking her home.
She left us there.
You liar!
That's 80 km more than I made today.
And what if we are lying?
What's it to you?
If you're worried, why don't you go?
Didn't get a chance at her because I escorted her.
Despite efforts to impress her.
She was worked over with the Reds.
She had nothing to lose!
And so what?
I let her have it.
Without the kid gloves!
Meaning what?
Want to know? Her honor is now safe.
What've you curs done? Talk!
Get out of here!
I'm confiscating your weapons.
Terada, disarm them!
You bastard! Crawl now on all fours.
Part VI
Who's there?
Show yourself!
Get out of sight or they'll spot you.
Hey, you fellows!
You can't go down there.
Why?
They're mopping up.
The road is down by those woods.
Our lines end there.
What's going on here?
We're dug in!
Go see our commander.
He'll be brief. Then you can decide.
We're entrenched here.
Our troops are of the best... armed with machine guns and mortars.
We'll manage until next year.
After next year... then what?
I'm getting to that!
You know what's happening in Japan?
And how about Manchuria?
Will Russia return it to China?
They will... I'm sure
To whom? Chiang Kai-shek?
No, not to Chiang.
Wouldn't he want it?
He'll try to get it with the U.S. aid.
Will the Reds fight?
They will.
Good!
We seem to agree there.
The U.S. will back Chiang in driving... all communists out of Manchuria.
Just wait... there'll be civil war!
And not too far off, either!
That's when we get into action!
With you 50-odd men?
Numerical strength means nothing.
Only spirit counts!
We'll join the Nationalist Forces...
It's suicide!
You're wasting the lives of the troops you lead.
How about yourself?
You lead your own men to meet a dog's death!
That's not true!
They're sick of fighting.
They only want to go home.
Why should they risk their lives for the Americans or Chiang?
Then go! Keep moving!
Don't interrupt!
We've plenty of supplies.
Those who wish to join us... make your own choice.
We'll camp nearby.
We'll depart early tomorrow.
I talked to some of their men.
Seems impossible to break out.
The scouting party was wiped out... by a Red punitive expedition.
Does that prove that it'll be safer to remain here?
Those who wish can stay.
Winter's coming.
We'll have to hurry.
A long way yet.
Can we break through?
They're bound to spot us.
The woods are dense. Why worry?
Tange feels we should surrender.
Where's Sup. Private Kaji?
Over there.
Kaji?
Over here.
Mind if we join you?
We've had enough of war.
You can do as you like.
Want me to inform your commander?
Don't do it!
Desertion will mean facing the firing squad!
Then how are you gonna leave the troupe?
We'll slip out and join you later.
As long as we get out of this place, we'll be alright.
We vowed we'd remain together... until death tore our ties asunder.
You can't shoot them!
The army is disbanded!
You have no authority.
This is none of your business!
The fact that you broke their vow is a minor matter.
But it could affect others.
It is our conviction, that the best way... is to bide our time and do battle!
We waste words, sir!
Sup. Private Kaji!
Just shut up and get out!
Our men are raring to go!
Let them try!
We'll see about your discipline.
Nothing but a pack of bandits!
So what? I'll cut your head off like a bandit!
Wait!
Call your leader.
He conspired with these men.
I'd not advise it.
He's ill-tempered like this one.
Mabye more so!
I am here.
Tange... step back!
Commander... can we make a deal?
I've some men that want to join you
I'm willing to swap.
They're are welcome to join us.
But deserters can't go unpunished.
Kitago... execute them!
Tange... pick up the rifle!
Commander... we're leaving now.
You'll be wiped out before winter.
But not us... we're going!
- What's that on their backs?
- Flame-thrower!
Without even advance or rear guards!
They're a pushover from here.
Go it alone then!
Let's go!
I'm giving myself up.
You're going?
After you move on,
I'm going over to them.
Call out before going, with arms raised.
We'll meet again.
If we survive.
Maybe you're right... and I'm wrong.
Who knows?
Let's just hope.
A woodpecker.
Why so worried?
As quiet as death!
I hope we can sleep under a roof tonight.
Split up here!
My poor back!
I've about had it!
If we hadn't split our party, we'd be dead.
When this chattered... I went cold!
Now I'll try it.
Don't take their weapons.
Why? There will help us.
Not necessarily.
If we're caught with those guns, we'd be executed!
They'll hear that and think that they won.
Use up their ammunition.
Then we're moving on.
That's no village.
Settlement, maybe?
Probably.
What'll we do?
Let's find out.
Maybe what the commander said was right.
We might be on the threshold of civilized society.
Split into fours!
300-400 meters between groups!
We'll go first.
If anything happens to us you can run or give yourself up.
Our whole future hangs on... what happens here.
Where are you men heading?
Past the railroad to the south.
Only three of you?
No, fifteen men are behind us.
You may not know, but the railroad is some
10 kilometers from here.
Just beyond that is the P.O.W. Camp.
Were there any soldiers passing through here?
They come by here quite often.
Bringing nothing but trouble.
They stagger in half-starved.
We have nothing left to share!
They've completely looted our fields.
Our main concern now is... what is to become of us?
What should we do?
Where did the soldiers go?
They went in various directions.
The chatter of automatic rifles always followed in their wake.
It is doubtful if any have survived.
Do enemy troops ever make trouble?
At first, we feared and loathed them.
But they're nicer than our own men.
And they bring us bread!
All in all, they're as naive as babies.
If we're nice to them, we're safe.
Not like our troops... who seek loot and a free ride!
You intend to remain overnight?
With our doubtful reputation,
I won't insist on it.
We can camp out.
Could you do us a favor?
Though the Russians promise to look after us, we can't wait.
I realize it might cause you trouble...
What is it?
They grow corn and potatoes... in a field some distance from here.
So you want us to steal?
It is an evil thing we ask... but the girls will do the work.
I only ask that your men protect them from any harm.
I understand! We'll do it.
Wait for us nearby.
Don't come too close!
Japanese!
It's cold outside, even with a fire.
Why don't you come inside.
I've kept a spot for you.
No sentry duty?
I'll stay up a while longer.
We'll take shifts.
It may shock the lad.
What?
After all... they're sleeping together.
And there are more women than men!
Are you angry with me?
For mentioning the Reds?
Not at all.
But... you think I'm filthy.
That's it... isn't it?
No...
You women... are you married?
Yes.
Need we starve because of it?
Must we bite our tongue off?
Who said so?
How many of us... can return to our normal lives... if we ever get home.
During a fleeting night with the men, the girls talk of returning home together.
When locked in one's embrace, it even seems possible!
But at dawn... it's all over!
The men become jittery... grab their weapons... and sneak off.
Soldier... you listening?
I hear you.
Women waste no tears!
They're waiting for the soldier who'll take them away.
We'll never get home.
Nor will we ever see our loved ones.
We don't know if we'll survive!
That's how it is. We're damned!
We think of only eating... to keep ourselves strong.
There's no hope left.
No happy reunions in sight.
It's our common fate. It's maddening.
It's maddening!
Our common fate... never get home...
No hope of reunion...
No place to return...
Never meet our loved ones...
Let's go inside.
It's safe at night.
No one will come tonight.
You go on inside.
I'll find some place to sleep.
Good-conduct men, eh?
You're quite a rare bird.
Too good to be dallying with my kind!
Are you saying I'd buy you with stolen food?
Michiko-
Michiko-
And walking towards you!
If you weren't waiting...
I could never carry on another step!
There's trouble brewing.
Some want to stay here or take their women.
How about you?
Seemed like a good idea while it lasted.
It was quite a night!
What's with you?
You're acting like a Zen priest!
No tails wagged your way?
None of your business.
I'm thinking of disbanding here.
Last night I really learned how... to appreciate women!
Why not discard our weapons and join them as refugees?
Women walk too slow!
They'd be getting in our way.
Not necessarily!
With men it's kill or be killed.
With women... they might go easy on us.
Some of the men would prefer to accompany us.
It's time we did something.
This may be our last chance!
But if we run into any Reds?
Men can fight their way out- but who knows what horrible fate would await us?
That lad... he's really afraid of you.
Why?
You tend to intimidate people.
Just remember... I seduced him!
Not my concern!
It is!
I hear you saved his life.
He insists on going with you.
So I'm coming along too.
Don't mind, do you?
This isn't play!
The past week we have made Terada a man.
Not that bad after all!
You were probably his first women.
You were probably his first women.
Though any man would do for you, he is still naive.
You are partly responsible.
And stay away from me!
I'm human too!
The girls insist on being allowed... to accompany you.
Become a refugee and take them along.
Wait till night fall, and take them as far as the railroad.
T hey can go their own separate ways.
It's not very long! Let's do it.
Is it too much?
I've heard of various opinions from the men and the women.
I don't know which is best.
It might be best if we formed separate groups.
You would then have free choice.
How about you?
I'm going straight on.
And weapons?
I go armed!
Are you sure you'll make it?
No. But I'll try.
I'm leaving now.
Terada, you'd better remain here.
You can pass as a young refugee.
Bury your rifle and bayonet.
I won't stay!
I'm going!
How about her?
She's depending on you.
You also wanted to be depended on.
She's nothing!
You rejected her... so...
Stop imagining things!
She's not interested in either of us.
She just wants male protection.
You can supply that.
Keep trailing me and you'll never become a man.
Emergency alarm!
Enemy troops!
Take cover!
Women... hide.
How many?
About twenty... Soviet and Militia.
Fire when I fire!
Then... the grenades!
Automatics first!
Wait till I fire!
Stop... please!
Don't do it!
What will happen to us? Please!
Please... men... don't do it!
Drop your weapons!
We surrender.
Terada, stay behind... with the women!
Stop crying!
It's not over yet.
Just starting!
Forward!
Get back in line!
In line!
Terada... get up!
Halt!
Halt!
No sitting down!
Get up! Keep walking!
Interpreter!
What made them halt?
Who gave orders to halt?
- From the rear.
- It came from the rear.
Who was it?
Better step forward!
The commander's mad.
Otherwise the whole unit... gets three days hard labor without food.
Who was it? Step forward!
Who's responsible?
You did it. Step forward!
Go ahead!
I'm the one.
Fool! Why'd you do such a thing?
I didn't mean to.
I didn't think they'd stop.
But I did wish they would.
He just wanted the column to halt.
That's the commander's prerogative.
It's insubordination!
You are a prisoner.
Just do as you're told.
Explain what I'm saying.
The commander doesn't know.
The men are hit by diarrhea.
This is inhuman!
I may have done wrong, but I want him to understand.
He says men in the rear have diarrhea.
The guard kicked one of these men.
He wants the case investigated.
He claims one of you kicked a prisoner.
Is that true?
There must be no maltreatment of prisoners.
Also... disciplinary violations by prisoners... will be punished!
Fascist samurai!
Let you off this time! Be careful!
Says you're a Fascist samurai!
Forward!
Filthy dog!
Excuse me.
It's okay. Forget it!
Fascist samurai? Great!
Shut up!
I, Noge, assume command of this work detail by orders of the Soviets.
The fortune of war was turned against us, and we are in defeat.
But our country still remains.
Some day we shall return to our homes.
A Japanese respects all authority.
We must endeavor to show the Red army... this national trait.
Our labor quotas must be met!
Only then I will be in a position to demand... improvement of your labor conditions, with Russian officers
Endeavor to maintain good health... and bear these bitter trials... and await the rebuilding... of our father country!
That's all.
They get officers' rations.
They should not talk!
Can't be helped. That's the law!
Oh? Discrimination even among Reds?
Terada-
From tomorrow, pretend you're ill and stay behind.
After we're gone, go rummage through their garbage heap.
Potato peelings, carrot scraps, anything!
It'll add to our rations.
If not... we'll starve!
We can't die yet!
Back to work! On your feet!
How can we without eating?
Come on, fellas, we're wanted!
What are you doing?
Making clothes... out of sacks.
What if they find out?
You have a good uniform, but I come directly from battle.
I warn you! Don't!
Though a mere gunny-sack, it's still enemy property.
You disgrace us!
Just leave me alone.
It's the cold season.
I'm wearing these gunny-sacks.
Unless you find me something better.
It's a hard work.
It's not too bad.
Except for that icy water.
After washing the food, I feel better.
I know we'll all live another day.
When I hear the singing,
I feel they must be good.
Their life must be good... outside the army.
When I joined up, I was so ignorant.
As you once said
"You fool!"
"Death in battle is a dog's death!"
You remember?
It was true.
We came a long way!
I didn't expect it to end up like this.
But I don't mind.
I'm beginning to realize how dear life can be.
This is the start.
It's rock bottom.
Now we can only go up!
Kitchen duty men usually chatter about women.
He's unusual!
He's talking about philosophy!
Then you stay behind!
I'll go work.
Ignore the bum!
He has the bad habit... of sneering at serious conversation.
I'd hoped for this meeting.
It's not mutual.
Are rapist-crooks allowed to run free in here?
I used my brains!
I'm one of the "active" elements here.
Me... Kirihara!
And your buddies?
Gone... to Siberia!
Must keep my eyes open.
Can't allow violations!
Kaji!
My day has come!
I must live... to see that dog unmasked!
If I talked 'down' to you,
I'll correct that.
After all, we must be
'democratic' from now on.
You're a good worker, but I hear you've ben sabotaging us.
No sabotage. He's a sick man.
It can't be helped!
I can't allow it.
The Red's officers are angry.
Though not your fault, other groups are pulling the same trick.
That's how they see it.
If this continues, they threaten to send us to North Siberia, from where no one ever returns.
That's how it is. What do you think?
I'm not impressed!
What was it that you wished?
No more sabotage!
On our rations, you'll live.
We must protect ourselves.
The Soviets are granting you... the privileges of military rank.
If you'll guarantee us protection,
I'll gladly change my ideas.
I'm P.O.W. myself.
You seem to enjoy defying officers.
Not enjoyment... it's necessity!
Then you refuse to end the sabotage?
It may not be right, but it can't be helped.
We can't let you do as you like.
Big aims demand some sacrifice!
We may be forced to deliver you to the Reds!
Yes, Mr. Noge!
I've faith in the future of socialism.
And in my countrymen!
I will work.
But I must also preserve the strength of those around me.
And that's it!
Such elements will bring trouble in the future.
Cope with him now!
What did Nage want?
Watch out or they'll take us off... this light labor detail!
You never work anyway.
It's guys like you who weaken my argument.
All I get is complaints!
You're a good egg, but stupid!
A serious life isn't always the best.
Delirious times call for delirious measures.
You're too naive!
A knaves logic, eh?
I'll show you what real labor means!
Dog! Loafing has made you go soft.
Stop it!
That's enough!
Regardless of the reason, that's going too far!
How can you stand there laughing?
Never treat your men like this.
Rest quietly... or you'll end up like that, too.
I won't die!
Not after coming this far.
I've had worse than this.
Get some rest.
Get a fire going.
Minegawa!
Interpreter Minegawa!
One of my men needs to go to the hospital.
They're packed!
They're releasing even the uncured.
Then get him some aspirin.
Can't... only in-patients.
I'll go ask. Will you interpret?
Sorry... I'm busy!
Can't be bothered with patients.
You know... you'd better get to work.
It's going too far.
Am I a suspect again?
Not you alone... but the
Red officers are mad at... the reactionary elements!
Superior Private; 1 year,
9 months of service.
Previous employment: labor supervisor.
Exploitation of labors, eh?
Yes... something like that.
Hey, what did he say?
I can't answer.
This is not a court.
I pronounce no sentence.
But resistance and negligence... cannot be condoned.
You will be assigned to a detail pulling up railroad tracks.
There are no barbed-wire enclosures, but there can be no resistance or escape.
To attempt either means starvation!
For sabotage, you're getting hard labor.
If you request or attempt escape, you will starve to death.
That's ridiculous!
I don't mind work, but be human! Let me have my say!
Tell him that.
What did he say?
What you say is nonsense.
And stupid!
Rascal!
Fascist dog!
What was that?
You wretch...
Somewhere... I have seen you before.
You're the one... the samurai!
I'd expect it from you!
The worst in the world are Nazi dogs.
The next are Japanese like you!
The meeting took considerable time.
What's going on? You look angry.
This one is a notorious Fascist,
Comrade!
An organizer of sabotage!
He dared to call us stupid!
This one who is addressed as, "Comrade" -
He might be... a Party member.
If only I could talk!
Stupid Minagawa!
I have so much to tell you.
It'd take all night.
However You'd never understand.
Explain why the sabotage.
Forget the fancy stuff!
I escaped with my life... from the field of battle.
But now I am convinced... that I have run too far.
It was an error of romantic miscalculation.
Russia's so called "historic mission"- sacrifices the individual... and tries to justify it.
Just or not... the individuals suffer.
They must protect themselves.
We have no choice!
After the battle was over, did you ever attack any of us?
I did.
Also the Chinese?
I did.
That makes you guilty of war crimes.
I could deny it... no evidence!
You... you deny that your troops... committed rape and pillage, right?
You deny it... though it be futile.
I admit my faults... and would point out yours.
Whether I was denounced by Kirihara or that officer, Noge, it does not matter... what matters... is that you use such mento... censure me for protecting my men, by sifting though your garbage heap.
Due to emergency, supervision is amiss, good is supressed and evil tolerated.
The fact that Socialism is better than Fascism, won't keep us alive.
Stand up!
You look angry.
You seem to dislike... our repartition of the work which doesn't... consider your situation, right?
If given more time a democratic movement will grow among you... and all will be well.
You must wait... not move on your own!
You admit to sabotage.
Such acts are not to be condoned.
Your leader has agreed to send you... to work on the railroad.
It's only one week. You must submit.
Anything else?
If possible... I'd like an aspirin.
He wants medicine.
He says his friend is ill.
I'll get it for you tomorrow.
You'll return, won't you?
One new life... remember?
If you're not up when I get back, you're a weakling!
Look after him.
Going away, huh?
Do me a favor?
What?
About Terada...
You wanted revenge on me?
You've had it.
But he's still. See that he gets food.
No problem to a "comrade".
You can't butter me up!
Squealed about Noge and me, but it didn't help, eh?
Too bad!
While you're sleeping in the cold, think what price you'll pay for kicking me out!
Here... have some!
I'll get you.
Kaji
It's you?
Tange!
It was stupid to run.
Also to be caught.
I might as well try again.
Are you sure you'll make it?
I couldn't say.
You'll be captured, killed, or frozen to death.
Not like you to trust in luck.
Why do you fear Siberia?
If you can't survive... no one can!
Send me to Siberia and forced labor if they will.
Their "Freedom" is phony!
Exploiting our labor and then re-educating us.
Is that their way?
It's not the amount of work.
Nor the short rations.
And even their guards... sleep on the ground with us.
What I'm saying... most prisoners aren't enemies of their class struggle!
Their treatment of such men... seems lacking in co-ordination.
In what way?
I may be wrong.
But they seem a bit self-centered.
Can't be helped!
Their strategy calls for a
Soviet First policy.
Can't be helped?
They're only human... can't be helped!
History will correct it.
That's not for us.
I'm fed up!
If they ship me off to Siberia,
I'm staking my life on that.
Terada!
Wake up... Terada!
I warned him not to try again, but he insisted on getting up.
And he went out after more food.
And Kirihara caught him.
He was beaten and given latrine duty.
We carried him limp and stinking to the hospital, but it was too late!
He died... calling your name.
You may not believe me, but I took the case to Noge!
He wouldn't listen.
The guards knew?
Yes, but they say it wasn't a crime.
No direct evidence.
Tange...
I've changed my mind!
I'm breaking out!
Don't stop me.
I'm making a mistake... but I'm going!
The big shot wants to see you about me.
At this time of the night?
I'm challenging you to a duel.
Are you afraid?
You're crazy!
We'll need Minigawa.
No need for interpreters.
There's one waiting.
Are you coming? Or will you apologize?
That's a laugh!
Siberia is too good for you.
This way!
You dog!
Had enough?
Stop it... please!
Please... I apologize!
I thought so!
Scum!
Die, you dog! You deserve it.
Your kind deserves to be liquidated!
Good people are suffering because of you!
Die!
Kaji-san!
Terada?
Are you still following me?
Don't Terada.
If you follow in my footsteps, you'll never grow to be a man.
No! You're already a man.
You need to be ashamed of nothing!
I'm walking on!
If I lose my way, you must guide me.
You're a man now! You must guide me.
Have I done wrong?
I never erred!
Tange is off in Siberia.
That rascal probably... despises and envies me!
Michiko!
Let me laugh if they want!
I'm returning to you.
I'm still walking on.
I'll beg for food at that village, then continue on to you.
Buzz off, beggar!
Are you deaf?
Get out of here!
You thieving rascal!
Thief!
This one is Japanese!
Look! A Japanese pig!
Michiko, forgive me!
I've come as far as I'm able.
Michiko, look... I've come this far!
Michiko!
I saved this for you.
I'll bring you this bread.
It's a manto for you.
My only souvenir.
After 700-odd days of being away, that's all I have.
I had to kill many men, to come back to you.
Killed many men!
Don't hate me for it!
I'm coming home.
Even as I'm walking towards you.
Michiko... do you still await my return?
I'm so happy!
I knew you'd return... no matter what!
Your whiskers! They tickle me.
You must bathe and shave.
No... the food must wait!
I had faith in you!
I knew you would come home.
I was so sure... so confident!
When I'm in your arms...
I seem to melt away.
Wait, Michiko! It won't be long now.
Here I am! It's not far now.
Trails dogged my footsteps, but it will soon be over.
Tonight I'll see you... hear you... and feel your tender hands.
And my memories will revive all that which we have lost.
Not far now!
Let me rest... just five minutes!
Then I'll continue on to you.
There were no 'Farewells' for us.
Michiko!
Tonight our life is starting again.
Michiko,
I'm back with you... by your side...
The End.
He dies for a rifle.
¿Murió bien, eh?
¿Pero para qué?
¿Para esto?
¡Para nada! ¡Para nada!
Whoa.
Let's go, men.
¡Alto!
¡Chica! Vàmonos!
Good morning, amigo.
Maybe you can help me.
No hablo inglés.
Esto es Mexico.
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Español.
Can I help you?
- What was he saying?
- That you're in Mexico now.
That anyone coming to Mexico ought to be speaking Spanish.
You, uh, in command here?
No, but I speak English.
Seen this man?
Hey, Joe.
- Mornin', darlin'.
- Where you going, Joe?
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm on my way.
You say all day, all night.
All night, all day?
Did I say that?
- You say.
- Ah.
Well, uh, things is different now.
The soldiers.
Yeah.
I gotta go.
Why don't you try this hotel.
He may be in there.
You mean they let Indians in there?
Anyone who can pay, sir.
One moment, please.
What is your name?
I am Lieutenant Franz Von Klemme from the Imperial German Army.
I'm what you'd call an adviser.
I'm Lyedecker.
Policeman.
You got some money?
Money?
What the hell for?
Get out of the window!
For me, yes?
Some dollars for me?
I saw you got dollars.
- I thought you said you loved me.
- Sure.
You give me money?
Yeah, well, later, maybe, huh?
I yell pretty loud.
Then the sergeant come up.
You want to talk to them?
What do you want to do with them?
Well...
Well, what do you mean?
They were pulling out the railroad track.
Your track.
Oh, my company's.
Not mine.
Why do they do that?
Damn it!
Why?
Why have they been fighting us for 400 years?
Because they're Yaqui Indians, that's why.
They call them los tigres de la rocas... the tigers of the rocks.
They say your track is on their land.
What shall we do about it?
Oh, whatever's customary.
Whatever you think is right.
Of course.
Muy bien.
Verdugo...
Verdugo...
I'm no part of this.
Do what you like... a trial.
I'm no part of this.
Look.
I know the value of things.
Bullets are valuable.
These are not.
No.
Listen.
Don't be like that.
You can give me money... or I'll make you some trouble.
Come here.
- Sargento Paletes!
- Señor.
Run! Run!
Run, Indians!
Run, Indians! Run!
Run!
Hey!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
¡Cabrón!
Mi general.
He is our prisoner.
Too bad I had to interrupt your entertainment up there.
Yes, you distracted my soldiers...
disbanded the Indians...
Very clever.
But now I got you.
Yeah.
Well, you wouldn't have me if that hotel had a back door.
Very clever.
Very clever.
Now, General, you don't wanna do that.
He's a very valuable man.
If you got to kill him, why don't you let me have him?
Perhaps I will kill you too.
That won't get you very much either.
- He's your friend?
- He's no friend of mine.
Well, then, what is he to you?
Bank robber.
He stole $6,000 from the Citizen's Bank in Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr. Lyedecker... how much did you say he stole?
Six thousand dollars.
- Uh-huh. When?
- Twelve days ago.
Twelve days, huh?
I see.
Fifty dollars.
Where is the rest?
You look Mexican, but you don't talk Mexican.
- What the hell are you?
- Well, I sure as hell ain't no damn Mexican.
My mama was a Yaqui Indian... and my daddy was from Alabama.
I see.
Well, I hope you know how to die.
I admire a man who dies well.
Now, tell me... where is the money? Hmm?
The money.
All those dollars you speak of.
Where are they?
Women and whiskey.
That's what I'd do if I was him.
Oh?
Six thousand dollars in 12 days?
Oh!
You could be the biggest stallion in the world...
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
Now...
No.
No, it was not spent on women or on whiskey.
Now, for the last time, where is the money?
Just like he said, jefe.
Half of it I spent on whiskey and women... and the other half I wasted.
Excuse me, sir, but if he spent the entire night in the hotel... don't you...
Yes.
Yes, let's go and take a look.
Where is the money?
Hey, friend, I hear your mama sells it on the street.
I don't think he understands English.
All that's fine.
But where's the money?
You really the honest-to-God law?
Somethin' wrong with that?
No! No.
You caught me, didn't ya?
That's right.
Now I gotta see about gettin' you out of here.
See, you bein' the Yankee law don't cut no ice with the Mexican army.
They ain't gonna let you get out of here.
Well, why don't you buy us out?
The money ain't worth gettin' killed for, now, is it?
I ain't got no money.
- Bank says different.
- Oh, I took it, all right.
But I spent it two days later.
- What did you spend it on?
- Rifles.
Rifles?
One hundred rifles for the Yaqui Indians.
Them poor devils hangin' on them telephone poles out there... them's Yaqui Indians... my people.
Well, if you tellin' the truth... that general's gonna kill you real slow.
Well, let me tell you about that general.
They told him to get rid of the Yaquis any way he could... and he took the easy way.
He's just killin' everybody.
Well, you've spent enough time in the States. You as American as me.
And you know you just can't go around stickin' up banks.
Yeah.
But I ain't goin' back.
Yes, you are.
On foot, on horseback, or hangin' across a saddle, you're goin' back.
How is it over there?
It's crowded over here.
How about out there?
Well, I think, with a little bit of luck, we might be able to get out of this.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna jump right out that window behind you.
Go ahead.
¡Sargento Paletes!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
Yaqui!
Mi caballo.
¡Sargento! ¡Vamos!
Well, I think we lost 'em.
All of'em.
Well, do you bring the rifles?
You damn betcha.
Romero send you?
Where are the rifles, Joe?
How come he sent a woman?
- They're expecting a man.
- Oh.
Now, uh, where are the rifles, Joe?
On the Chilina trail, not too far from here.
Well, I hope so.
They're there.
And where is the profit for you, Joe?
There ain't none, Sarita.
Look, you told me to get the rifles, and I got 'em.
- What are you bein'so tough on me for?
- Because I know you.
Boy, you sure have soured up in the last few years, ain't ya?
Yes. I have changed.
I watched them hang my father... and I helped him to die.
You hear that?
I helped my father to die.
You say the Chilina trail?
Yeah.
We'll see.
Mara.
Oh, shoot.
Now, why'd you do that?
I wasn't gonna do nothin'
I couldn't have done before.
You're pretty good, Joe.
I can't take any chances with you.
- Let's go.
- Where we goin'?
Back to Phoenix.
How come them to give you a badge in the first place?
Well, I guess I took a job that nobody else wanted.
Even at that, it took me a whole year to get it.
- How much they gon' give you for takin' me back?
- Two hundred dollars.
And the job permanent-like.
Shoot, that ain't even hardly worth botherin' about.
Well, Joe, that depends on what you got in the first place.
Yeah.
I ain't never been worth a damn in my whole damn life.
Ain't never been worth nothin' to talk about.
I never even had a job permanent-like.
But now I finally done somethin' for somebody... me.
I finally amounted to somethin'.
Yeah.
You robbed a bank.
Let's go.
I should have known.
You lied to me.
There's no sign of tracks.
No people. No guns.
What are you talkin' about?
They're there. Come on. I'll show you.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
- Where do you find him?
- I didn't find him! He found me!
Will he help us?
- Señor, will you help?
- Hell, no.
- Why not? You ain't got nothin' better to do.
- It ain't my party.
Come on.
So, we meet again, huh?
You murderer!
You assassin!
Too bad I don't have enough time for you right now.
Lopez!
Now you...
Mr. Sheriff.
Mr. Half-breed.
By the time
I'm through with you... you'll be ready to tell me everything I want to know.
I'm not afraid.
Damn it!
Stay on your feet!
Go to hell!
Damn you, you big son of a...
Muy bien.
Ay. Look what the rurales found.
Rifles.
Two Indians with these mules.
Now, how would two Indians... find 100 rifles, huh?
They were skinned alive.
Slowly.
But they wouldn't say.
Tsk tsk.
Nice day, Verdugo.
Indeed it is, Mr. Grimes.
Hello.
My name's Grimes.
Steven Grimes.
Oh, that's... that's nice.
Mighty nice.
Well...
You know, fellow Americans.
And, uh, what's a nice fellow like you doing in a place like this?
I'm with Southern Pacific.
We run the railroads here.
Then, uh, you're really all right with that general, ain't you?
Look, Lyedecker, what's the point of all this?
If you don't tell him what he wants to know, he'll have you killed.
Well, maybe put a good word in for us.
- Why don't you get the hell outta here?
- Tell him something.
Anything.
Six thousand dollars is not worth dying for.
And he's just gonna let us go.
Is that right?
Why don't you go away and stop botherin' us?
Look.
If he has you shot, it'll create terrible problems.
- It'll be a terrible thing for all of us.
- Sure as hell will.
- For us or for the railroad?
- For both.
The way relations are between the United
States and Mexico...Well, you know.
Look... we don't wanna talk to you.
You understand?
We don't wanna talk to you.
Hey, wait a minute, Joe.
Wait a minute.
He's got the rifles, and he's got us too.
What do we got to lose?
Tell you what you do.
You go tell that general I wanna see him.
What about my men?
How are they progressing?
Well, sir, they fight well, they train well.
They don't seem to take too naturally to the drill.
Well, the parades will come later.
As long as they can fight.
Sit down.
Sit down.
What disturbs you?
The rifles, sir.
Someone is arming the Yaquis.
If they get hold of any more guns, you're going to have the tiger by its tail.
The Yaquis do not have the rifles.
I do.
Yes, sir, at the moment you do.
Von Klemme, you worry me.
That was my intent, sir.
No. I mean, you worry me.
- Oh?
- Yes.
You...You seem afraid.
Of what?
I don't know.
Perhaps if you would return to Mexico City...
I would prefer nothing more than that, sir, if my orders could be changed.
You know that I don't need you.
But, you see, sir... we Germans are here to advise, so we advise.
Oh, yes.
Now, tell me, what perfect piece of advice have you this time?
Finish off the Yaquis as quickly as possible before more guns come through.
I know that, don't I?
Of course you do. Then send them south and sell them to the wood merchants.
No. It isn't worth it.
The prices are too low.
I have to feed them, send some of my men with them.
By the time we sell one, the price will be lower than the price of a cow.
Then kill them all.
That is your advice?
That is my advice, sir.
Very good.
So, all the time, eh?
All the time the $6,000 was right there in my front yard, huh?
Incredible.
- I'll take him back now, General.
That's the deal. Right?
- Now wait.
Wait.
Tell me something.
Where are the other rifles?
I don't know what you're talking about.
When do they arrive?
Answer the question, Indian.
- You got 'em all.
- That is not the answer!
- There ain't no more guns!
- How do you know that?
You know, Lyedecker, as I told you before,
I think you're part of it.
I ain't a part of anything!
This man stole $6,000. For that amount of money, there can't be no more guns.
You refuse to answer, eh?
Look, there ain't no more damn guns.
Very well.
Too bad, gentlemen.
¡Sargento Paletes!
What did all that mean?
Look like they're gonna shoot us.
Verdugo, I suggested that if they told you about the money... you'd let them go.
Grimes, you run the railroad.
I'll run the state of Sonora.
And don't you ever forget it.
- Por favor, General...
- ¡No, señor!
¡Alto!
You know somethin'?
What?
I think our string has done run out.
The hell it has.
We're gonna get out of this.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Well, there's nothin' to it.
A big, giant hand is gonna reach in here, pick us up... take us away and put us down someplace... right in the middle of a whole bunch of women and whiskey.
That ain't funny.
Well, I ain't laughin' neither.
That ain't funny at all!
Stay out of other people's business.
That's what I always said and that's what I always done.
But look at me now.
Smart Lyedecker.
Hung up on a fence with a bunch of scruffy Indians.
Well, that's too bad about you.
Your number's comin' up over there, and it's just too damn bad.
- You know why?
- No, I don't know why. Why?
- 'Cause you'd have been a hell of a lawman.
- You damn right!
'Cause you don't care about nothin' or nobody... just like all them big boys with their badges.
What do you know about badges?
You're just a pissant border half-breed.
I know a lot about it.
I know all about them small-town, barbershop, hair-cuttin' sheriffs.
And I know all about them big-town, big-bellied... billy club-swingin' policemen from St. Louis.
- You don't know nothin'!
- The hell I don't!
They look you up and down, and you're guilty!
You don't get no trial, just like we ain't gonna get one now!
'Cause them guys over there don't care about nothin' or nobody, just like you!
That's why you'd have been so good with a badge.
Washington's going to react very badly to this.
What are they going to do?
Send a note saying,
"Where is our black policeman?"
- And then what?
- They'll ask questions.
They're going to ask my company a great many questions.
And they will get answers,
I'm sure.
Your company cares for its trains... not for two gringos that disappear in Mexico.
¡Fuego!
Hold it, gentlemen.
Padre.
My sons, allow me to help you...
We ain't no damn sons of yours.
There's probably more than one scattered around here someplace.
Fear and despair are human failings.
Yet we are human.
Make yourselves ready to die in peace and love.
Why don't you talk to Verdugo about some of that peace and love... instead of tryin' to get somebody ready to die.
That's right.
Ain't no man ever died ready for it.
I want you to go with love in your hearts.
I want you to go to hell.
Allow me to hear your confession.
Whatever you got in that book, just put me down for it.
- Lyedecker.
- What?
I'm sorry you got mixed up in this.
You ain't half as sorry as me.
¡Ataque!
What the hell?
Goddamn it!
Come on! Come on!
¡Rapido!
¡Vamos! ¡Vamos!
Hyah! Hyah!
I want their heads.
Some kind of woman, ain't she?
Yeah. Kinda stout.
Now that you got them rifles...
what are you gonna do with 'em?
- Take 'em to General Romero.
- General.
Why every time four Mexicans get together, one of'em makes himself a general?
Look, you.
Romero can call himself anything he wants.
I knew him when he was young... when he brought the people together to fight.
Good or bad, he's all we have.
It's a good thing you have him,
'cause me and that one there, we goin' north.
We are, huh?
Yeah.
What do you say we wait till we get them rifles to General Romero?
Then I'll go easy-like.
Uh-uh. No good.
Lyedecker, you're a mule-headed son of a bitch.
You saw all them Indians hung up like a side of beef.
- After all the trouble we went through to get them rifles...
- We?
Yeah, we!
Look, I spent 15 years in the 9th Cavalry... keepin' the law and chasin' bad Indians.
But this one ain't my business, it ain't my fight and it ain't my job!
And besides...
I don't much like Indians anyway.
We should have killed him!
Yeah.
I think she's right.
You know your trouble, big man?
You're dumb.
Just plain ol'black-ass dumb!
Now who's dumb, you half-breed?
Huh?
I am!
Let me up!
Come on!
Thank you.
Don't shoot him!
And let him kill you?
The rifles, they are more important.
I don't wanna drag his big ass all over Mexico.
- What's it gon' be?
- I guess I ain't got much of a choice, have I?
We split up here.
You take the guns upriver.
I'll meet you in Delgado.
I'm glad to meet you.
Ah.
Woman, what are they looking at?
It's the first time they've seen a black man before.
Well, if they wait a while, they'll see this one turn into a chili bean.
I sure wish I had myself a fried steak.
Well, two or three times now, you could've killed me.
Sí.
That is true.
- I need you.
- What for?
Mira.
Those rifles, they are what keeps Joe here.
He is what keeps you here.
I want you to help us.
No, I won't do that.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. Yeah, I reckon I am.
Oh, not of being shot at.
That's happened plenty before.
Lyedecker, if... if you would join with us... for just a little while...
I won't worry about YaquiJoe.
Afterwards, you can have him.
You ain't, uh, partial to him?
No.
I don't trust him.
He's a bad man.
But he's smart... and he's important for us now.
Nothing else?
No.
Nothing.
No deals. I'm gonna take him back, and there ain't gonna be no deals.
We got problems. Verdugo's about one mile behind us, but I don't think he saw us.
Get the rifles. Let's get out of here.
¡Vámonos!
Adios.
Gracias, kid.
Keep goin'!
Go on!
- ¡ Sargento!
- Mi general.
Collect all the children and take them to the rancho.
With the general's permission, the time might be better spent collecting the rifles.
Von Klemme, I'm gonna tell you something once and for all...
and let it be a lesson for your future.
I never do anything without a purpose, and remember that.
Humara.
Los niños. Los niños.
El rancho.
El rancho.
Yaqui.
The children.
They've taken all of the children... and holding them for the rifles.
They're holding 'em for us too, you can bet.
Well, we have to go back.
Look, Sarita, I think we ought to go on to Romero... give 'em the guns, and get some more men, huh?
No. We have to get those children.
We will.
We'd better make this quick and quiet.
Shh!
Well, I wonder if he died ready for it.
Get them kids out of here!
Hey, big fella.
How you doin', man?
Where's Joe?
Where's the whiskey?
I guess you never can tell where they might go to drink, huh?
Don't-Don't shoot, Lyedecker!
For God's sake, don't shoot!
- I didn't know it was you.
- Obviously!
Hey, Joe, look what I found.
Hey, Big Ben.
You ain't still thinking about taking me to Phoenix with you, are ya?
You'd better believe it, hombre.
Well, you're a stubborn, son of a...
Damn.
Well, what's you gonna do with him?
Well, uh, whatever's customary and whatever you think is right.
I'll-I'll be glad to take care of him for you.
Lyedecker, this is silly.
There's no need for...
Keep him alive.
We might be able to use him later.
I'll do it.
Didn't turn out to be much, did it?
Hmm?
Pretty fancy, huh?
For me?
Too fancy for me?
She had one like it when my father worked here a long time ago.
She's dead now...
Verdugo's wife.
I always wanted one like it.
It looks like you were born for it.
It's a lie. But you're a pretty good man after all, Lyedecker.
I guess I know that.
I know what I am.
I don't have to go looking for it.
Then why are you a policeman?
It's a job.
Everybody has to do something.
What the job is ain't important.
It's how you do it.
Are you good at what you do?
Well, it ain't much different than the cavalry. I do the best I can.
Well, that is a hard thing to do.
For all the bad things
I have said to you...
I give you this.
No. No! No!
No! No!
Please, not like this!
Not with you.
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
Lyedecker.
He died yesterday.
Ah, sí. The black gringo.
We have heard of you.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Good day for travelin', and we're gonna travel.
Hey.
What is this stuff?
What is this "mi general"?
- You mean you don't know?
- No, I don't know.
Well, it seems that you have been elected the new general.
I ain't no damn general.
That's just...
That's the dumbest...
That's just plumb crazy! Come on!
Buenos días, general.
Look, you tell them to get out of here.
Tell them I don't want 'em following me.
Tell 'em to go away.
Tell 'em I ain't no general.
Not for no bad-ass Indians.
Not for nobody.
You tell 'em.
It looks to me like... you're back in the cavalry business...
mi general.
I'm sure the rifles are somewhere up there.
I can promise you that, with Romero.
No.
If he gets the guns and the ammunition... he will probably come down that mountain, and we'll have war.
I know Romero.
He's a dying tiger.
He wouldn't come downhill with an army of 10,000 cannons.
No.
Lyedecker is the one.
I want his head on a stick in the middle of the plaza for everyone to see.
Lyedecker and the others.
Sir, I personally think we ought to be going after Romero.
Now, listen to me, Von Klemme.
I know Romero.
I know these mountains.
I know my country, and you don't!
So shut up.
Shut up and follow my orders.
I want Lyedecker.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
Buenos noches, mi general.
Lyedecker?
Oh. Your supper is almost ready.
- Tortillas?
- No.
Look what I found.
You said fried steak.
Is that, um, the way it is?
If that's the way you want it.
No.
Let me get that.
Here?
Lyedecker, you are my man.
You know, you gotta be, uh, careful about a thing like that.
I don't have to be careful.
I am your woman for as long as you want it.
Do you want me?
What does Verdugo use that train for?
- What are you going to do?
- Answer the question.
Now, look, you can't be...
You're not going to wreck the train?
In one minute, I'm gonna pinch off your head... and mail it back to the home office.
The train carries troops and supplies from Nogales to Hermosillo.
It's well-guarded.
Does it make any stops along the way?
No.
- No stops.
- There is a water tower...
in the plano, the flat part.
He stops there.
Now, look, you're not going to wreck the train.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Lyedecker...
God!
Dear God!
He ain't gonna help you.
¡ Hey, muchachos!
¡Una muchacha!
No, no, no, no.
He ain't here.
Well, must be he didn't make the trip then...
'cause I've been watchin' this car all the time.
- How many did we lose?
- I don't know for sure.
Hey. You did a real fine job.
You seen Grimes?
No.
Last time I saw him, we were diggin' in.
I saw him.
He had a horse.
I guarantee you, he's almost to Nogales by now.
What the hell are we gonna do now?
Load the train up.
We're still goin' in.
- Uh, hello. Buenos días.
- Buenos días.
¿ Verdugo aquí?
Well, is he here?
Grimes, I should have you shot.
What are you trying to do, become an adventurer?
Well, that's good, because the role does not suit you.
Tell me, Mr. Grimes... how did you happen to be with them in the first place?
I was taken at the point of a gun.
I was a prisoner.
- For so long?
- All right.
He did return... finally.
- You escaped, huh?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
They're going to attack the town.
Really?
- How?
- They've taken the train.
Are you sure?
You saw it?
I heard the plans.
- There was nothing I could do.
- Of course not.
Look.
Let them come in.
And after they've gotten off the train... we can catch them in the streets.
Mr. Grimes, that would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.
First, you have them nicely trapped on the train... and then you allow them to get into the streets and houses?
Grimes... your train will be a small sacrifice to our cause.
- Go check up there... the machine gun.
- Yes, sir.
¡Alto!
¡ Fuego!
Sarita!
We did all right, didn't we?
Yeah, I guess we did.
I mean, we won, didn't we?
Well.
We won, huh?
Yep.
I think I can put the train back into running order. I thought you'd like to know that.
It'll take time, and I'll need men for the labor.
Yeah.
It's important that, uh... we know where we stand, huh?
What the hell for?
Well, look out there.
You're their leader now.
You should think about that.
- I ain't no dadgum such thing.
- They think you are.
They do?
This place is yours, and you have an army.
With them, you can control the entire area for good or bad.
You're ready to say no to that?
Damn right I am.
Oh, no, you're not.
A man like you... with your intelligence?
The whole state can be yours.
All of Sonora.
- No. Hell, no.
- You have to.
The choice isn't yours.
The decision's been taken out of your hands.
Do you know what'll happen if you walk away from all this? There'll be anarchy.
- What...
- These people...
Your people, they'll drift apart without a leader.
And then another general will come from Mexico City... with another army, and these streets'll run with blood again.
You'll need to move men and supplies.
You'll need the railroad.
I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
Lyedecker!
- Hey, you ain't leavin' are you?
- Yep.
You can't do that.
I mean, I ain't goin' with ya.
What are you gonna tell 'em?
What are you gonna say?
Well, I'll tell 'em I just didn't bring you back, Joe.
Of course, they'll be able to see that for themselves anyway, won't they?
Yeah, but you're the leader.
I mean, if you go, there could be anarchy.
There could be blood in the streets.
Look, Joe, they'll follow you now.
In fact, it could be a good deal for you.
Yeah, but, Lyedecker, what do you got to go back to?
You came down here with nothin', not even a job permanent.
- After all them years, nothin'.
- Yeah, I thought about that.
You did?
What'd you think?
I thought I oughta go back and give it one more shot.
Lyedecker, maybe
I oughta go back with ya.
You don't wanna do that, Joe.
You belong here, and I belong up north.
Like I said,
I wanna give it that one more shot.
And, Joe, good luck, amigo.
All right, dadgumit, let's get this dadgum army together!
All right!
All right!
Date: 13th Day of May, 1630
Weather: Fair
The heat of day rises hourly
10 am: Hon. Heir Bennosuke departs bearing fresh river trout for presentation to the hon. Lord Doi at His Lordship's mansion
No incidents worthy of note
However, around midday an ex-warrior, formerly in the service of the Lord of Geishu, appeared at our gate.
HARAKIRI/SEPPUKU
Official residence of Lord Iyi
A former retainer of the Lord of Geishu?
Correct!
And my names is Hanshiro Tsugumo
Tsu as in Ohtsu
Gumo for clouds in the sky
And your errand here?
My lord's downfall came about in 1619
I have since moved to Edo and have managed to make a meager living while seeking employed under a new master
But in such times of peace, all was in vain and my hopes are crushed
The years passed unrewarded and lacking means of subsistence, life has become intolerable
Rather than live on in dire poverty and disgrace
He would die honorably by hara-kiri
He begs use of a corner of this mansion for the ritual
Such is his request
Another one?
Is there no end?
And your wish, sire?
Good! I'll see him
A former retainer of the Lord of Geishu,
I am Hanshiro Tsugumo
I respectfully beg your favors
Clan Elder of the House of Iyi, Kageyu Saito
I am indebted to you for this interview
My purpose here...
I am fully informed
Rather than to live on in dire poverty,
You prefer to die honorably by hara-kiri
Is that not so?
Correct!
Truly a most worthy turn of mind
I am greatly impressed
You mentioned having served the former Lord of Geishu
Did You know Motome Chijiiwa?
Chijiiwa?
You don't remember?
He also served the Lord of Geishu
In its day, the Geishu Clan counted some 12,000 retainers
I regret to say...
Indeed? But that is a minor matter
Early this year... possibly the end of January...
An ex-warrior... a Motome Chijiiwa... came to this mansion
On a mission identical to yours
He also begged permission to perform hara-kiri
Are you interested in how he fared?
I am listening
A former retainer of the Lord of Geishu?
That is correct! Former retainer of the Clan
And known as Motome Chijiiwa
And... your errand?
Abolition of our Clan led me to seek humble quarters in Edo
Here I have managed to subsist while waiting to serve a new master
But in a world of peace there is no hope
I expected this
And... what would you do?
Let me see...
A truly deplorable state...
The Sengoku Clan erred
They set the precedent
No... I don't agree
Why not?
The ex-warrior who entered the
Sengoku mansion was sincere
He intended to die
And touched by his sincerity the Clan took him in as a back-room retainer
They did not err! They did right
It is the others who copy him, who cast such shame on us
Far from wishing to die, they merely seek material aid
They are but common extortioners!
You prefer to die honorably to die at our door
Offer him a pittance to go his way as do the other clans
No... that would never do!
Offer coins to one and others will soon flock to our door
They will pour forth like ants to a mound of sweet sugar
Following the end of civil war, the land abounds with ex-warrior
Scrambling for food like animals!
The House of Iyi is blunt-witted
Their reputation for grit and moral fibber
Once sufficed to keep ex-warrior away
But... now?
Even pride in the martial arts is a thing of the past... swept away by years of peaceful living
Such would be the rumors circulated throughout the land
His Lordship absent and such harmful rumors spreading in his absence...
It must never be!
Bribery to send him packing has never crossed my mind
Without the least intention of dying he dares pretend...
Hon. Elder!
Allow me...
Your pardon...
His Lordship's retainer... Umenosuke Kawabe
Motome Chijiiwa... ex-warrior of Geishu
And now... kindly come with me
To the bath-room
In his Lordship's absence the hon. Elder reported your plight to our hon.
Heir, Bennosuke
Our young master is deeply moved and wishes a word with you
I am allowed an interview with the hon.
Heir, Bennosuke?
That is correct
However... those clothes will not do
First you must bathe
Proper dress is being prepared for you
I am in your hands
I am overwhelmed
Incredible! Am I dreaming?
Not only inconceivable... it's...
Your pardon!
Forgive the unexpected delay
You must change now
To death robes
You're shocked?
Was I not to see your hon. Heir?
He has expressed such a desire
Odd! It must be a misunderstanding
It's not!
The hon. Umenosuke Kawabe passed me the information...
Oh? Hon. Kawabe did?
I begin to understand... yes... it could be possible
Then... you know about it?
Yes, it becomes quite clear
The hon. Elder reported your plight to our hon. Heir who was deeply moved by your courage and wished to make you one of us
However... a samurai resolved to performing hara-kiri must be one of unwavering will
As nothing can alter his decision, allow him his final wish...
I would readily spare the time for a word with him but Lord Doi requests my attendance
Extend him all courtesies of my house and have my men witness the ritual
Let it be a proud example
Such were his words... as told to me
Well? Did you enjoy it?
A most interesting story
A tale befitting the valiant traditions of the House of Iyi
And... what are your intentions?
Oh... you are referring to this?
Exactly!
Be not concerned...
I came here with this avowed purpose in mind
Most laudable!
I commend you on your unwavering decision
Hon. Tsugumo
Perhaps I should continue my story about this Motome Chijiiwa
I am listening
Come... time is fleeting!
You must change your robes
All preparations have been completed for your hara-kiri ritual
I beg a boon!
A boon... allow me a little time!
I won't run!
I promise to return here
Just a few days!
It's too late
It's unjustified!
Was it not at your request that we made arrangements?
I beg your forgiveness! Just a day or tow...
I will return!
A Samurai's word is sacred. It cannot be!
Our master swordsman,
Hayato Yazaki Young...is eager for action!
One move... you'll be ripped open!
And there are others...
Rather than be chopped up like some dead fish die in honor...
Come... you must change robes
Heed me, hon. Ancestors!
Forgive the unworthy ex-warrior which defiles our sacred garden
The family honor is at stake the future of the Tokugawa Clan and our sacred Samurai Code
I beg you be witness to my decision!
Both blades?
It's useless!
Such a blade couldn't slash a radish!
A samurai's blade is his soul!
Blade of bamboo...
And his is to die by hara-kiri?
A shameless wretch!
All is now ready
Motome Chijiiwa...
Rather than live in dishonor, you have chosen to die by hara-kiri
A most commendable wish
An end befitting a true warrior
I am shamed to admit that even this House with its proud traditions boasts very few men of such integrity
To witness this most unique rite all the retainers of this house hold have been gathered here
Go your way... with heart at peace
A boon, sire!
Oh? What is it?
A day or two of grace... I implore you!
I seek not to escape! I will return
I beg you... implore you!
An odd request, indeed!
I have been informed that Edo abounds with ex-warrior who disgrace our class by threatening to perform hara-kiri at one's gate unless a pittance is offered them
Don't tell me... you...
No... I would never...
Yes... I'm sure you wouldn't
A man of your lofty character would be, incapable of such disreputable action
Now... feel free to proceed!
This unworthy will be your second
Exponent of the Shindo-Munen School
Though words be unnecessary, I would explain
The rite of hara-kiri has changed with the years
Of late, this sacred ritual has fallen into idle formalism
The victim no sooner reaches for his blade, than he is beheaded
No disembowelment is involved
In some cases, a fan is placed on the tray instead of a blade
Today, however, no shabby imitation of this sacred rite will be tolerated
All will proceed in traditional form
Understand?
Like this... you will open your bowels crosswise!
Only then will I undertake to execute my duty
I act only when disembowelment is to our satisfaction
Is that clear?
Proceed!
It is your blade... and you die by it
A samurai's blade is his soul
What blade could be more appropriate?
Well... what keeps you?
Please, proceed
Strike!
Behead me!
Not yet! Slash open your bowels
Why stops? Pull your blade!
To the right!
Yes... even as a final resort... to bite off one's own tongue...
A praiseworthy... yet disgraceful act!
And after all... he threatened with only bearing blades of bamboo
By the way... what are your intentions?
I assume you are referring to this?
The fate of this hapless youth was exactly as I related it
Hon. Tsugumo... heed my advice and reconsider
No. No! Set your mind at ease on that score
Unlike this youthful Chijiiwa, neither of my blades are of bamboo
I will perform the ritual without biting off my tongue
Enough!
Hon. Tsugumo... at your insistence,
I grant you your wish
Attendant!
Hanshiro Tsugumo, ex-warrior of Geishu, seeks to die by hara-kiri
As his dress is inappropriate, he is to be supplied with robes...
What is it?
Such considerations are unwanted
My present attire most befits a destitute ex-warrior headed for the next world
For the considerate treatment extended me this day
I am deeply grateful
Hanshiro Tsugumo fails to find words to thank you
Now... I proceed
Incidentally, hon. Elder... who will be acting as my second?
Ichiro Shinmen has been selected
You have a preference?
Yes... I would request the services of hon.
Hikokuro Omodake
Hikokuro Omodake
His fame as a Shindo-Munen School swordsman precedes him
True! Hikokuro has won wide acclaim
Hikokuro...
Omodaka has absented himself today
He has sent in a formal request for
4 or 5 days of rest
Indeed? Then it cannot be helped
Hon. Tsugumo... as you have just heard,
Omodaka is not present
Any other choice?
Hmm... most disappointing!
I had looked forward to hon.
Omodaka acting as my second
Could I not beg his special attendance?
Yes... perhaps. His fatigue was not too noticeable yesterday
It couldn't be serious
Attendant!
Go seek out Omodaka and inform him that I wish his attendance
Go now... hurry!
I am indebted to you for your kind consideration
And now... will you await him here?
Or will you come inside?
To re-enter your mansion may cause my determination to waver
My pending journey might become distasteful
I will wait here
Your grim determination is awe-inspiring
Hon. Elder
There is nothing to be gained from tedious waiting
Allow me to relate my life story to pass the time
Oh? The story of your life?
Yes. The life story of an impoverished ex-warrior may sound boring but my fate here today may be the fate of others tomorrow
Those who heed my tale may even find certain gems of wisdom hidden therein
Your fate today... another's tomorrow?
Yes... sounds interesting!
Heed well his final words
The words of a man heading for Eternity
This is no ordinary testament
There is much to be gained from it
Hon. Elder...
The tale you related earlier is complete with all truths and facts?
It is
The Geishu ex-warrior, Motome Chijiiwa, was a lad of some slight acquaintance
Motome Chijiiwa...
Yes... a lad of some slight acquaintance
Motome was a handsome youth of 15
And my daughter, Miho, a child of 11
Eleven years ago...
Yet... I close my eyes and it all comes back to me as if it were only yesterday
Another round?
Why bother?
Our duty is to rebuild
Archery will not help us
Oh, peace... wonderful peace!
By the way, the 22nd is the 7th anniversary of my wife's death
Oh? I remember the date... but the 7th already?
Yes... and I plan a small ceremony at my residence
But not offerings...
I understand
But I can hardly believe it! Seven years?
And what is more, a war-scarred veteran like you bringing up that charming child all by yourself.
You... it's the other way around!
When hon. Yuki died,
I wondered how you'd manage
And yet... look at you... a perfect kite-hawk combination!
The widowed kite puttering about bringing up his young one
Only to find his young grown into a princely hawk!
A fine young hawk!
Nonsense!
He grows up only in body
A far cry from the noble hawks soaring overhead
You know... I always felt
I'd be of no use off the battlefield but somehow I've managed
Had life gone on thus, all would have been well
But not our life!
Our lives are like unto houses built on foundations of sand
An ill wind means the end
What brought about the downfall of
Milord's vast Geishu domain?
Need I go into details?
You must all be informed
Repairs on Hiroshima Castle were construed as a threat to the Tokugawa Shogunate
In June of 1619...
Our master's domain was abolished and 12,000 innocent retainers of his household were suddenly deprived of means of livelihood
Jinnai!
The Hon. Hanshiro Tsugumo
Final requests to my friend of long standing:
Demise of the hon.
Castle Repairs Commissioner is expected at any moment
I precede him on this final journey my attendance alone will suffice
I beg you to refrain
But my son,
Motome is yet a mere child of 15 years
I beg for him your future guidance
Impatient one! Could he not have waited for me?
Hanshiro... I forbid you!
You are not to join me it is all so meaningless!
Jinnai is enough!
Be not imprudent!
Jinnai died first to forest all any attempts by you
He accompanies me on your behalf
And now, Hanshiro, it is your duty to carry on
To take over for him...
Who else is there to look after his son,
Motome?
Masakatsu now goes to meet Jinnai
Hanshiro... have you no message for your friend, Jinnai?
No message for Jinnai?
Inform Jinnai... just inform him...
The future and destiny of his son,
Motome Chijiiwa
Are watched over and protected by
Hanshiro... with his life!
Hon. Tsugumo
Well?
How did you fare?
Sire... he seems gravely afflicted
And what malady ails him?
His family reports that he suffers high fever and much acute pain
I begged to visit his bed-side but he suffers such great pain that they would not allow it
I departed upon leaving your message
Then we have no choice
This sultry weather... it must have afflicted him
Hon. Tsugumo... you have heard his report
I must ask you to name another as your second
Ah... most unfortunate! He seems too indisposed to attend
Then I beg the services of Hayato Yazaki
Hayato? You wish Hayato?
Inaba... has not Yazaki been absent also?
Yes, sire... he applied for leave to overcome his fatigue
Hon. Tsugumo... I regret to say that
Yazaki is also unavailable
Oh? Hon. Yazaki is also indisposed?
That is most unfortunate!
Then... as I have no choice...
I would request Umenosuke Kawabe
Hon. Elder... could hon. Kawabe also be ailing?
Could such a thing be possible?
Well, well! It seems that he also is indisposed
That all three of them should find this day unfeasible...
A strange coincidence
How odd indeed!
All is not well...
Hikokuro was most insistent and forced Motome Chijiiwa to commit Suicide
It was Hayato Yazaki who discovered that the blade was of bamboo...
No... that was Umenosuke
After all... I warned them against it
It's no use now
Very true!
But how will you cope with him?
He is not one to die meekly
He must be plotting something
Whatever his intentions
I will force his hand and make him perform hara-kiri
If he refuses,
I will have my men cut him down without mercy
What happens within these walls remains an unknown secret herein
The men will attack at my signal
But Hikokuro and the others bother me
I should send someone but under the circumstances,
I wish you'd go personally
Hon. Tsugumo
Though summer days be long, time is fleeting
I bid you resign yourself
But hon. Elder! There can be no ritual without a second
Yes... I have just discussed the matter with my major-dojo
The men you request are not available
So I will pick one for you
Ichiro Shinmen!
You will act as second for the
Geishu ex-warrior, Tsugumo
Fulfill your duty with care
With your permission,
I named three men to serve as my second
I would still insist on one of them
Have you no ears?
All three are indisposed today!
Is that not clear enough... or can't you hear?
Oh? If such be the case, there is nothing I can do
I fear this ritual must be postponed
Hold your tongue!
Your knavery goes too far!
First you beg a site to perform hara-kiri
Now you quibble over a second
You never intended to die!
Money was your motive!
If I were a common extortioner, would I be placidly sitting here?
I came prepared to die
But hara-kiri alone cannot ensure an easy trip to Hades
A second is needed to lop this off
A skilled master swordsman
What is more, I do not die a criminal
I am free to choose a second
You're a disgrace! A fraud!
Hara-kiri was not your motive...
Insolent dog!
Wait!
Restrain yourselves!
I beg a word with all present...
Pray restrain yourselves!
What now? It is too late for words
No... not yet!
I am not yet finished...
With my life story
For any more such lengthy tales, I have no ears!
Hon. Elder
Should you force my hand,
I will do battle like one possessed
Many of your innocent men will sustain injuries
Some may even die!
Would it not be wiser for all to hear out my tale?
Then I will disembowel myself in good grace
Should hara-kiri be too good for me, you may turn your men on me
But for now... I entreat you to hear me out to the end
You will remain true to your word?
I swear it!
On your samurai honor?
Good! But make it short
I have no ears for long, absurd tales
Stand back, men!
Now... where was I?
Oh, yes... my master's house abolished; the death of Jinnai Chijiiwa and I had just reached the point where he entrust me with his son
Following my master's downfall,
I left the land and came to Edo
The end of civil war created hordes of ex-warriors
In better times, a clan would gladly have employed a distinguished ex-warrior
But in times of peace, the honored warrior is no longer in demand
He eats or fasts as Fate dictates
Yes... it shames me to recall our life during the past 8-9 years
However... even amidst such misery,
My daughter, Miho, continued to grow and soon it was her 18th spring...
Hon. Sire...
Should I not return by midday, your meal is prepared
The finest delicacy loses taste when one dines alone
I will wait
Then after I receive payment,
I will purchase some dried fish
Your pardon!
Busy? You're going out?
Yes... to see the whole saler
The Hon. Mikawaya?
Good luck!
Experience surpasses training! You're quite an expert now
Forgive me
For constantly requesting advances
My earrings are so meager
Your frank innocence disarms me
I had intended a few harsh words
By taking the initiative, you tie my hands
I bow to you
By the way... that proposition I put to you the other day...
Have you given it serious thought?
Yes... my mind is made up
Oh? That's gratifying!
Yes, it takes a great burden off my mind
No... your proposal regarding Miho...
I have definitely decided against it
In short, the adoption of Miho would merely be a pretext
The Sakakibara family would then make a concubine of her
Hon. Tsugumo... it's a powerful clan
To be related to them would assure you a rewarding future
Yes... I am aware of that
However, hon. Seibei never will I sacrifice my daughter to further my fortunes
Pride is all right but should not a parent consider her plight?
A young... and beautiful... girl without even a festival kimono
Day in and day out... slaving at her father's side!
Hon. Tsugumo... do not be led a stray by these times
It's futile to fight the tide
For Miho's sake and your own... it's all too obvious...
For Miho's sake and your own... only because she is blessed with such beauty is such opportunity made possible
Confucius says
Confucius says
Ignorance of one's mission makes not a Superior Person
Ignorance of one's mission makes not a Superior Person
Ignorance of etiquette means failure
Ignorance of words means ignorance of men
Class dismissed!
- Thank you, master
Hon.Sire...
Welcome, Sire...
Have some
I took the liberty of preparing us some tea
However, Motome... I have come for some serious words with you
Honored one... why such formality?
Indeed... the days and months flow past so swiftly!
Miho is already eighteen
And looking more and more like her mother
It seems unbelievable that she could be my child
No... if she had taken after me, such beauty would be impossible
Honored One... why are you talking this way?
You see... Motome...
I want you to take Miho as your wife
I realize that this is all very sudden
But... how about it, Motome?
Surely you are aware of the poverty in which I live
As tutor for my neighbor’s children,
I sustain my miserable existence
How could I possibly take a wife?
You dislike Miho?
Do you like her... or don't you?
I do not ask you to marry Miho merely because it was your sire's wish
No... boorish warrior that I am,
I can feel for you and Miho
Convincing Motome was no simple matter
The lad had a stubborn streak which I had failed to realize
However... he did love Miho and Miho certainly had no objections
The crane which lives 1,000 years
Symbolizes the countless happy joys;
The tortoise prevails 10,000 years
Bearing, the crowning triple pleasures
Hay the glistening sands long reflect
The sun of numerous morning to come
Two years passed, brought them their first son
A son who was named Kingo
It was I, of course, who served as the infant's godfather
Welcome, sire
No... not asleep
Hon. Sire... you are too generous
Nonsense! Amidst your own chores, you care for me
What is here... now that I am alone, my wealth becomes a burden
Can't take it with me
Oh, no... it seems I have awakened him!
Yes, my fine rascal dimples are not for a warrior's son
You little rogue!
Oh? The Matsudaira Clan abolished?
Yes. As with many another provincial warlord
However... this Clan was a link in
Tokugawa power
One outcome is sure... more ex-warriors!
Listen?
You heard how one threatened hara-kiri at the Sengoku mansion
An ex-warrior from a provincial clan, one Shume Chi...
Will this wake up the Sengoku?
It doesn't matter
Many ex-warriors force themselves into various mansions threatening hara-kiri
To stop these disturbances, these households reluctantly offer them coins
A most shameful turn of events
Yes... a disgrace!
These happened
No officials' assistance, things will continues
As you have said, no report of officials' efforts for the help of times like these
Live under the poverty... how can one become so base?
Yes... what is it?
It is time now
It's the time, he wants his milk
Whenever he cries out, you feed him
An evil habit to form
Look... Kingo!
How, look...?
Kingo, like it?
With Kingo, we fear nothing
Life was full of laughter
However... such happy days were not destined continue forever
The snowing winter, snow was as thick as the mountain
One day... Miho vomited blood
One had always been a delicate child and drudgery was too much
Her frail body had been over-worked too often
I can help nothing...
Motme tried hard
The poor boy!
Town Labor Poo
Fifty men, forty yens
Fifty men, forty yens
Look, samurai!
Stay out! The townsmen need work
A sword-bearing laborer can only bring me trouble
Twenty men, forty-five yens
Motome's plight was pitiful!
His every effort ended in vain
Miho went from bad to worse
Strange how evil hounds misfortune!
I still recall how we barely survived that year
Then as the spring of this year brought forth plum blossoms...
What is it?
Motome!
Is it Miho?
It is Miho?
It's... Kingo...
What? Kingo?
He's feverish! He burns with fever
Miho... were you standing idly by while this child was stricken?
It seemed a fever brought by a cold
But... what did the physician say?
He came... did he not?
You have not called in the physician?
But... why didn't you?
Kingo! Don't give up
This Old One and your parents have long since sold our valuables
There is nothing... nothing we can do to save you!
Though we be so helpless
Kingo a good samurai must not give up the fight!
Kingo, you mustn't lose!
You mustn't!
You mustn't lose... you mustn't!
There is still one final chance
In my absence... look after Kingo
Motome... what is this new idea?
I know a former retainer who is now a money-lender
But his rates were so high!
And this is no time to be concerned about details
You are right!
If you know such a person... hurry!
Yes, I go now
I will return by evening at the latest
As Miho is also bed-ridden,
I beg you to look after Kingo
Do not worry, I'll be here
But, Motome, he is seriously ill
The greatest haste is required
Make arrangements and hurry back
Yes... I will return by evening
I go now
We depend on you, Motome
No, let me do it
Kingo... just a while longer...
What delays him?
This will not do!
What is keeping Motome?
What takes him so long?
Getting up now will do no good for
Kingo's fever!
Where can Motome be?
He should have returned by evening
He promised!
What keeps him? Where can he be?
I continued to wait
Each hour seemed as long as autumn day
But we waited in vain
Motome never did return to us
I will return by evening
Look after Kingo...
Those were his words on departing
Such was my final parting with
Motome Chijiiwa
However... later that night at the Hour of the Dog
Motome did come home
But only by himself
He was accompanied by a gallant escort of retainers and underlings of the Iyi Clan
Such was the hon. Chijiiwa's touching request
However, our gateway was unsuitable, and we cordially accommodated him in our garden, where he was able to fulfill his wish
Of late, one hears of mansion frequently visited by ex-warriors who extort a pittance by threatening disembowelment
We understand that the households are greatly embarrassed thereby
However... advent of this honorable samurai, Chijiiwa, who did die by hara-kiri:
And the honored House of Iyi which did not fail to adopt appropriate measures; these two serve as examples to ex-warriors and to weak-kneed members of other households
A refreshing breeze and eye-opener for such disgraceful elements!
Surely a matter for mutual congratulations
Show the blades
A moot point
Will you examine the two swords of the deceased?
Please note... they are of bamboo
Of bamboo?
Miho!
Note that both blades are of bamboo
We want no claims regarding loss of the blades
Is that quite clear?
You understand?
The... Motome begged the loan of a blade from one of you?
Such was not the case
He died magnificently... using that blades!
Motome... died by the bamboo blade?
Correct!
We witnessed in detail the ritual performed with bamboo blade
An unsightly affair!
A samurai needs to die by a true blade which is a warrior's soul
Now... we take leave
Miho wept... and wept... and wept...
Forgive me!
It was I... who was so thoughtless!
You sold those blades...
You sold them for Miho's sake...
And still... I never realized...
Yet... I never parted with mine
I would never have dared
In my ignorance,
I clung... to these worthless symbols
Useless tokens...
Ravaged by raging fever and in a coma,
Kingo died some two days later
And three days later...
Miho also passed on... following her child to the next world
Thus was Hanshiro Tsugumo left alone in this world
Alone and solitary figure...
Hon. Tsugumo...
Does that conclude your tale?
Yes... in a way
No! I wish one final word
I beg all in attendance to listen well
No matter how dire his circumstances, for a member of the samurai class to extort aid by threatening hara-kiri is an abominable act and cannot be forgiven!
On the other hand,
This household's method of coping with Chijiiwa can justly be said to leave much to be desired
A samurai shaming himself
By begging a few days of grace must certainly have a reason
Certainly it was not out of place for you to ask his reason!
Is this asking too much?
Did not one of you now present feel need for such consideration?
With a wife fatally stricken and an innocent, ailing child demanding immediate attention...
He begged this chance to inform me and to make one final effort before leaving matters in my hands and returning to this mansion
Hanshiro Tsuguma!
Enough of your excuses!
Chijiiwa may have been victim of various circumstances
But he himself want to die!
Though matters did not go as planned, he sowed his own seeds
It was not for him to resent, blame or accuse others!
It was for him to forget all else and die a magnificent death
To go unwavering to one's death is the way of the true samurai!
But to plead for days of grace!
Signs of a true coward!
No wonder one thought him mad!
Yes, you are right!
Truly, Motome was not in his right mind
But for such state of mind,
I have only praise
Even the famous samurai is a mere human being
He cannot live on air alone
In a crisis, even men like Motome will stand by their family
Yes, and I'm glad!
The bamboo ex-warrior
Not only samurai... even the townsmen sneer at
Motome's memory
Yes. Let them who would... laugh!
It is impossible to fathom the hearts of all men
The ruthless Shogunate policy of wiping out the provincial lords, brings ruin to innocent thousands!
The well fed may never realize this
Some among you may loathe Motome for his pleas
Put yourself in his position, what would you have done?
After all... our samurai honor... merely glosses the surface
Enough nonsense!
You dare suggest that our honor is merely superficial?
That's right!
Some threaten hara-kiri and try to evade the consequences
Such wishful thinking can be perilous
Any who ask are allowed to die
In fact... we see to it that they do!
It is the way of our Clan
No half measures for us!
In other words, you believe that I have no intentions of dying?
That I come, enraged at the way you dealt with my son-in-law, merely to give voice to my numerous grudges?
Is that what you believe?
Need you ask me?
You need only ask yourself
Either way... you have no intention of letting me get away?
That is my choice
I see no reason to ask you to leave
Hon. Elder... suspicious eyes welcome the devil
You recognize the proverb?
My promise to perform hara-kiri is not a fraud
Despite all my efforts... you still...
First of all... even if I do live on, what is there to look forward to?
Much rather would I hurry to join Motome...
Miho... and Kingo
In the Land beyond where they await my coming
However... I cannot go to them with both these hands empty
Is that not true?
Explaining Motome's predicament enables your men to understand his position...
To reflect on their own hot-blooded approach...
Not all are convinced that they did right
Was it possible that they might have carried things too far?
Perhaps more appropriate measures could have been taken...
A single word to this effect would being satisfaction to Motome
Would this not be most fitting gift I could take to him?
Such were my plans... but to my regret, that was not to be
Now we understand each other
Your touching tale is of no use
No... a samurai who claims that honor serves only to embellish the surface could never reach our hearts
In short... they are the illogical grumbling of a senile ex-warrior?
Well... it serves no purpose to lament that now
Forgive my prolonged narrative
Now I go through with the ritual...
Oh... one moment!
Before beginning,
I must return some items entrusted to me
Each bears the name of the original owner
Please, study them
Hon. Hayato Yazaki... hon.
Umenosuke Kawabe... both swordsmen held in high esteem by the Iyi Clan for their honored bravery
But, hon. Elder... and others in attendance... be not concerned!
I accepted only their top-knots and not their lives
My encounter with hon. Yazaki took place six days ago...
One moment!
Hon. Kawabe was disposed of five days ago... on May 8th
But the master swordsmen of the
Shindo-Munen School, hon. Hikokuro Omodaka was not to be made light of...
Possibly aware of the fate of his two companions, he was never off guard
Yes... to be honest,
I was at a loss as to how to deal with hon.
Omodaka
As you reach out for your blade
I draw... and fell you with one blow!
However... I fear that my blade will be blocked by this lintel
A sideward blow at your waist is hampered by this pillar
Forgive my delay
I couldn't find you
Please, make ready
As one cannot duel here, we will repair to the Plains of Gojin-In
Hovel that it is, the owner may be annoyed if you fail to return
And someone must come to dispose of your corpse
I suggest a short note stating that you proceed to the Plains of Gojin-In to duel with Hikokuro Omodaka
He wisely took advantage of the winds
But a blade not only cuts... it can stab or be used to snap others
Swordsmanship untested in battle is like swimming on land
Be that as it may it was my first fight in
16 years
Since the Summer Siege of Osaka
Taking a man's head is not easy
But to take only his top-knot was harder still!
Irrespective of skill, to lose one's top-knot is equivalent to losing one's head
A laxity and dishonor which even death cannot wipe away!
Yet, they claim illness and hide until their top-knots grow back, hon. Elder!
You boast of traditions of bravery but even the code of the House of Iyi seeks only a false front!
A maniac! Fell the culprit!
Hanshiro Tsugumo has fallen, sire
And our casualties?
The casualties among our men!
Masakatsu Sugita... Sobei Umemura...
Ichiro Shinmen... Uemon Yoshioka... died in action
Eight others suffer injuries
The ex-warrior from Geishu,
Hanshiro Tsugumo, died of hara-kiri
Our retainers died of illness
No retainer of the Iyi Clan was killed or maimed by this impoverished ex-warrior!
At his own request, ex-warrior Hanshiro Tsugumo performed hara-kiri!
Our men died of illness!
There can be no connection!
See that none other dies of illness
The injured must be given treatment immediately!
Hon. Elder... I return
Omodaka... Hikokuro... died last night at his residence
The two others, Kawabe and Yazaki, still claim illness... but...
Foolish one!
Why did you not order them to die?
Go immediately... order them to die by hara-kiri!
And... take some skilled men with you!
Should they refuse, they are to be slain on the spot! Understand!
Also, these men... Omodaka, too, are victims of illness... not hara-kiri!
Stupid one!
You know the ways of administration...
You fall to realize the implications?
You idiot!
I go now, sire
Geishu ex-warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo, died by hara-kiri in the early evening
His words and actions markedly odd
Many considered him as being out of his mind
Also, disposition of Geishu ex-warrior,
Motome Chijiiwa, who died in January, was found appropriate and the fame of the House of Iyi was greatly enhanced
In this case also, our stern measures were soon known throughout the administration
Consequently, three days later, during formal session at the Castle,
His Lordship took occasion to laud our hon.
Heir Bennosuke
...in peace as in turbulence...
With this borne in mind the House of Iyi will prosper throughout the ages

NARRATOR: In the 11th century,
Europe was a patchwork of feudal states, extending from the
Mediterranean to the North Sea.
Powerful dukes exerted life-and-death control... over their primitive subjects.
One such, Duke William of Ghent, held a coastal area in Normandy.
To protect the marshes of a troubled corner of his domain, the Duke sent warriors led by his most trusted knight,
Chrysagon de la Cruex.
This Norman warlord was charged to impose the Duke's will... on his vassals and to protect their settlements... from Frisian raiders, who crossed the waters... to plunder and pillage.
MAN: Hey-oh!
United tower.
From here to the sea and beyond, it's yours.
Mine.
SECOND MAN:
From here to the sea.
We're pilgrims to nowhere, and we have arrived.
What's the matter, Draco?
Your belly hurt?
- L, Milord?
- What is it, Brother?
What did you expect?
Whatever you want.
Your wish is mine.
For myself, I expect nothing.
[Birds squawking]
Queer, moody place.
Still, it's mine.
Given by the Duke himself.
A holding no man in all Christendom wanted.
I want it.
You have it, and you'll keep it, Brother, as the Lord kept Israel.
This place has the dimensions of heresy.
[Horn sounds]
[Birds screeching]
[Horn sounds]
An alarm.
Raiders from the sea.
Frisian raiders!
They've sacked the village, taking women to the boats now!
RAIDER: Peasant pigs!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Charge!
Norman! Norman!
Father!
- De la Cruex!
- You.
CHRYSAGON: Frisian butcher!
I warn you...
Aah!
You are bloodied, Chrysagon.
I had him, Draco.
I had him in my fist, and I lost him.,
There's no one else worth ransom?
There's only one prince of the Frisians.
So, they bring their heathen brats along to show them murder.
Here's your lesson, boy.
Hold your hand, Bors.
Let me have him.
Why?
I'll make a page of him, and being a page, he'll make a lord of me.
He will sting you with this.
Where would such a scurvy ship's boy steal such a blade?
You the village elder?
My name Odins, and this is my son Marc.
You took that from a Frisian?
Aye, Lord. I fought.
Where are the men of the garrison?
- Gone, Lord.
- What do you mean, gone? Killed?
- I mean gone.
- And the warden? Dead?
Last night I saw him very much alive.
Methinks we've got a seigneur instead of a warden in a tower.
What difference?
- This'n saved thee.
- This'n can also hang thee.
- So could Tava.
- This'n has the right.
But he's a great knight.
20 years in the wars, the priest said.
Our lord he is.
Our lord, perhaps, but not our master.
Nor master of the stone, nor the tree.
- Milord?
- Good father.
Sir Chrysagon de la Cruex?
Hugo de Bouillion, Milord.
Servant of God.
My, uh, my flock, Sire.
Your vassals.
A simple people, but pious in their fashion.
They were druids here before Caesar's day.
Mere children who revered, in all innocence, the customs of their fathers before them.
Customs of the devil, sir priest.
Not so, good sire.
Not so? To think such faceless brutes could sway a priest.
Oh, they have faces.
The all look much alike to me.
CHRYSAGON: That doorway has no protection.
No protection at all.
It stinks.
CHRYSAGON:
You could find it blindfolded.
PRIEST: The raiders...
CHRYSAGON: It stank before the raiders came.
My men marched 20 miles today.
Now they must sleep in this.
PRIEST: Milord, when the Duke's messenger told our warden of... his removal, he grew somewhat lax.
CHRYSAGON: I knew him in court.
He was somewhat lax then.
A little... disordered, I fear.
CHRYSAGON: Where is he now, your lax warden?
It is to be hoped in Heaven, but I doubt it.
Your quarters, Milord.
[Bird squawks]
He was always chasing some goose girl up a hayrick.
He was bewitched.
Carried off by devils, he was.
These people here have ancient customs... in which he may unthinkingly have joined.
The tree and the stone?
Worshipping the devil?
PRIEST: No. He damned the devil's flesh, but women's flesh he loved, and devils dearly love to masquerade.
Priest... are you saying she was a witch?
Witch?
White flowers.
What is this?
PRIEST: Her bridal wreath.
Come, Sir Priest.
Was she a witch or a bride?
A virgin bride.
The warden's?
A villager's.
God's grace.
Bee among the flowers.
The mark of death.
[Screech]
There must be willing girls in this place enough for any man.
Why took he a virgin?
"Keep their good will," the Duke told me.
Him before me, this rapacious bastard.
Small loss when the Frisians killed him.
Milord, it was not rape.
They liked the warden well.
- Who liked him?
- These people here.
In olden times, they sanctified a marriage... by giving the bride on her wedding night...
Bors, burn that bed.
Devils... devils.
PRIEST: Yes, yes.
Our fens and marshes attract them in great quantity. l, with these eyes, have seen them.
I speak of different devils.
The Frisians.
Oh, yes, yes, Lord.
Might I offer you some meager food and drink?
- They'll be back.
- I daresay, Lord.
Their land lies North across the sea but two days distance.
- I cannot...
- I know where their land lies.
PRIEST: And they do raid our coast this time of year.
I have a green cheese...
Next time I'll hold him fast...
Two fishes, a garlic soup... as he held my father.
Father?
Taken in battle by Frisians,
I've been told.
And stripped bare.
Most extortionate ransom.
They are a harsh people.
He came home broken, and died so. A pauper knight.
It must be hard to lose your lands, I'm sure.
We lost all.
It was a long time ago.
A lifetime.
What were you saying?
- I said...
- Tell me at table.
We'll gnaw bone tonight and hunt tomorrow.
Thank you, Milord.
You'll enjoy our forest.
There's deer, wild fowl, and tusky boar.
[Woman screams]
Down, dogs! Down!
Down dogs! Get off! Get off!
Be still, woman.
They won't hurt you. Get off!
She's all right.
Counts as a kill, though.
Come on, pig girl.
It's never as bad as all that.
Pig girl? No eyes in your head, man?
WOMAN: Aah!
Here's the pelt, and there's the otter!
I told you I want no trouble with these people.
Handle them softly, I said.
Just what I was going to do, Milord.
You are out to hunt, dog.
Get on with it!
All of you!
[Dogs barking]
Are you hurt?
Ah, nothing much.
Say your name.
Bronwyn, Milord.
From the village?
I own the village.
I know, Milord.
What house?
Odins, Milord. The elder.
- His foster child.
- Speak up, girl!
May I dress myself, Milord?
Yes.
Are you going to watch me?
Yes.
- Are you cold?
- No.
- You afraid?
- Yes.
Why? I'm gentle with horses, hawks.
Come here.
Come here.
[Bee buzzes]
- What is this?
- A wedding garland.
And you're a virgin?
MAN: Bronwyn.
What happened to you?
He did nothing.
A bee stung him.
He?
I fell in the water.
And he did nothing?
- They were hunting.
- Who?
Lord Chrysagon.
And he did not touch you?
Am I hurting you by asking these questions?
Then why do you weep?
Marc, I love you.
I have since your father took me in.
Stay away from him.
Yes, Marc.
Stay away from him!
[Bird chirping]
[Laughter]
God's great fist, I can see him.
Milord and brother.
Planting himself in front of her and staring her down.
Giving her battle orders.
You go, wheel around.
Keep your flanks covered, pull up your breastplate.
Your rear echelon's exposed!
[Laughter stops]
BORS:
You haven't removed your shirt.
That's why the wound frets you.
CHRYSAGON: Frets me?
You fret me like an old woman.
Told you it's a scratch, nothing more.
Fester, then, in flame.
DRACO: You have a fever, Brother?
Can't sleep.
Maybe you took it from that girl at the pond.
DRACO: What's she like?
Oh, I don't know.
A woman, tan hair, breasts, belly, legs.
A woman.
She has a calm face.
So has a cow.
How was she?
I let her go.
You let her go?
Small wonder you can't sleep. Why?
There's a strangeness in this place.
I felt it since first we came here.
Nonetheless,
I thought, mine.
Poor place.
Marsh, naked tower, the world's end, almost.
But to have it, to hold it...
If only...
What do you think of this land?
Dung heap.
You deserve better... much better.
What say you, Bors?
You are my lord.
This land serves you,
I serve you.
But if it should be a land unholy?
Here.
Do you feel nothing, hear nothing, see nothing?
I feel bored.
I hear the wind.
I see fever burning holes in your head.
Silence.
That speaks of spells.
BOORS: Ah...
DRACO: Bors?
Sire, all men have heard how when the Lord Christ came, the old Gods, demons, and spirits with snaky hair... were cast down into hell.
Good riddance!
But some say they still linger, prowling the dark corners and unblessed places of the earth, changed to beggar men and goose girls.
Bors, you surprise me.
You've produced a thought.
BORS: God help the man who meets one.
The blood in his heart changes.
And what of that devil's dish he met today?
She's the cause of his fever, and that's the truth.
- How so?
- Because you let her go.
DRACO: Bors... you know who she is?
Find out from Rainault, put her to work in the kitchen.
[Grumbles]
Why waste her charm on pigs when there's use for it here?
Oink! Ha ha!
[Man groans]
[Horse neighs]
BORS: Come here!
[Door squeaks shut]
BORS: Now, girl... you will take his arms and hold him firm while I...
Lie flat, Milord.
Here!
You will hold him here and here.
He will plunge like a gelded colt.
I did.
Take him.
BORS: A trick I learned from a heathen Moor.
If a wench holds him, he doesn't kick.
Pride of manhood, I suppose.
Take 10 men to hold Milord... or one woman.
Sire, I shall count to five.
[Sizzling]
One... two... three... four... five.
[Door shuts]
[Bird squawking]
[Falcon chirps]
[Bird squawks]
DRACO: Volc, call him down here.
Damned falcon never knows what he wants.
VOLC: They're human that way.
DRACO: You know less about falcons than a flea.
To train a falcon, you need a larger brain than a falcon.
VOLC: Come down here or I'll wring your neck.
Damn me, but just look at Sir Flea bristle.
[Horse neighs]
[Volc laughing]
I'll kill him.
I'll kill them both!
I'll twist your nose with the slack in your belly.
I'm sorry.
CHRYSAGON: Draco, Draco...
Draco! Draco!
[Horse neighs]
Ya!
[Horse neighs]
[Horse grunts]
Don't run from me.
- Is that poppy?
- Yes.
What do you want with this?
We call it hawk's eye.
We get chamomile from it for seasoning.
It also has the power to rob men's minds.
Like magic.
- And it can kill.
- Oh, no magic.
My foster father heals with these herbs.
- Purple foxglove.
- For lovesickness.
Three leaves or four can stop the heart.
- Witchery.
- No, Milord.
Not witchery.
They all kill.
What's that?
Mistletoe, the golden bow that twines around the sacred oak.
Why is the oak sacred?
It's connected to the gods.
- You believe that?
- Yes.
Before I came, they told me that... marsh people had spotted bellies and webbed toes.
- You believe that?
- Not since I saw you... in the lake.
CHRYSAGON:
We'll lie under that tree.
- No.
- I feel good about you.
I've been fighting all year.
I haven't had time to lie under trees.
- Let me go.
- I fought last year, too.
I haven't even seen a girl with tan hair.
I'm tired of fighting.
- Milord, l...
- Shh. Don't talk, Witch.
Have pity.
[Birds squawk]
[Wings flapping]
This is not lawful.
DRACO: You want to serve in this troop? Ha! Ha!
I want to be Milord's man.
People of your tribe cannot bear arms.
Besides, you have no skill with weapons.
RAINAULT: I found poachers in the glen, sire.
PRIEST: They are not poachers, Milord.
DRACO:
With a pair of stags, Rainault.
DRACO: You said two.
RAINAULT: Yes, sire.
These stags were dead already, Milord,
Iocked together by the horns.
They needed the meat, surely.
The Frisians slaughtered most of the livestock.
That be truth.
Frisians killed our pigs.
DRACO: And so they poach.
Woodlands belong to the lord.
They should carry the stump of the right hand in the left.
The woodland belongs to the duke.
We keep it for him.
We keep the peace here, too.
CHRYSAGON: We share
Lord Draco's outrage.
To kill the duke's deer is a great crime.
- But there is no proof.
- Proof?
- It is my opinion...
- L, too, hold opinions!
- I am a knight!
- I can write letters!
- The devil's tools!
- Enough!
Beware, Milord.
Another time, your compassion might be mistaken for weakness.
There will not be another time.
You, Volc!
What are you doing with that boy?
Why, training him, sire.
It's the only way.
Keep to the tower now, boy.
BORS: Lord!
BORS: Milord has spent the morning on you.
Don't waste his time.
MAN: I speak for my son, Marc, who humbly beseeches our lord's grace... and consent to wed.
To this girl?
The foster daughter of my house, called Bronwyn.
When?
- Tomorrow, Milord.
- So soon?
They've been promised since childhood.
It's time, Lord.
I give leave to your son to wed.
MAN: We thank thee.
Work on the moat goes well, but the drawbridge...
Blacksmith here says to tell you...
No more now!
Get him out!
Ah!
[Thunder]
[Dogs whine and bark]
Bones of the saints!
What's wrong with you?
- Is it the wench?
- Draco, enough!
I'm only saying, if you want her, take her.
- I told you...
- It's not my business.
You don't eye a woman every day.
CHRYSAGON: She marries tomorrow.
Why not tonight?
She's not a she-goat, Draco.
I won't take a woman the night before her wedding.
You're right.
It's wrong tonight.
I could bite my tongue.
What about tomorrow?
Get... what's his name, the priest.
DRACO: Sir pri-iest!
You have the right.
The wedding's tomorrow...
The right of the first night.
Ask the priest.
Of the seven golden virtues, I swear, the most peculiar is chastity.
Look, you're the lord of this place.
She belongs to this place.
Therefore, she's yours.
Ask him.
DRACO: Dear learned priest, we need your counsel.
PRIEST: Such as I have to give.
DRACO: Are you well-versed in church law, father?
Middling well, though my order runs not to law.
It seeks rather to make amends... for the evils wrought by men through the absence of love.
Splendid. It is of love that I would ask you.
DRACO: Now... this noble knight has need of innocent pleasure.
There is no such thing as innocent pleasure.
Priest, scholar, certainly you have heard... of the right of the seigneur... to take a virgin bride on her wedding night.
The church does not admit it.
- It is pagan law.
- These are pagan lands.
Not of a Sunday morning,
I assure you.
These are evening matters.
We found the warden with a bride in his arms.
Was she not freely given by her people?
The warden...
DRACO: What do they say in Rome?
Juste primi noctes.
That being the Roman for it.
You hear that?
It's known in Rome.
And damned as heresy.
And yet...
- And yet...
- Speak on, good father.
Well, now, fertility.
Some say it's pagan.
But who's not pagan in some matters?
True, true!
I love the speech of scholars.
Young folks think only of frolicking.
Desist, I tell them.
But they will go a-wantoning.
So, lest the devil take them,
I preach them a text from Holy Writ.
"Increase and multiply,"
I say,
"replenish the Earth."
And oh, how they obey me.
But how this touches on your problem...
Oh, clearly, clearly!
The pagan part may honor pagan law.
We ask no more.
What hour's the wedding?
The wedding in church or t'other?
What other?
We'll be at the church.
To claim that right?
War lords, forebear!
In this weak hand lie lightnings, and I use them.
- Ah, no, no sacrilege.
- Not in God's church.
I dare say, there's another wedding... their tribal way.
That wedding's theirs.
Feasting, drinking, clowning, dancing...
Oh, Lords, how they do caper.
Aar!
[Speaking foreign language]
[Revelry stops]
Hold the boy.
ODINS: You come to do us honor, Milord.
To claim my right.
[People mumbling]
- He has the right.
- No!
BORS: Silence!
- No!
- Let it be, my own son.
ODINS: He has the right.
Not by his law, but by ours.
Ours.
Long before the Norman came, with his church and his tower, we worshipped at the stone and tree.
And in the fields, we plant holy seeds.
Then, as now, a virgin sacrifice... was made for the fertility of our earth... and the enrichment of our tribe.
To take her your way is rape.
It should be done our way... the old way.
You accept this?
With a ring of fire.
The sacred way of the Druids.
You accept this?
I do.
Prepare then a high place.
I have a high place.
Make it ready... and your men wearing iron.
Wearing iron, Norman lord, and standing.
As the moon rises, the virgin bride... shall be brought to you.
ODINS: But hold!
At the rising of the sun,
I will reclaim her.
So be it.
[Whispers a prayer]
ODINS: I go to wait the rising of the sun.
You weep?
- No, be still.
- Yes, Milord.
Milord. Milord speaks and all obey.
Is that not what you want?
I want you to be free to go or stay as you will.
But I fear you'd go, so...
Look at me!
I have the right to take you.
I have the right.
You want me to go?
Go... back to your pigs, your strange, damn people, your death-sucking bees, yes!
Go, and let me go.
Go!
Wait.
I want...
I need you as I need breath... sunshine, fire in winter.
Bother...
That's what festers.
I want my life in you.
It's truth.
It goes beyond the blood, fever, and the flesh.
It's sacred for a highborn man to begin your life.
BRONWYN: Are you afraid of me?
I cast no spells.
CHRYSAGON: Better if you did.
Spells can be broken.
Milord, l, too, am bewitched.
You. You had them hold me!
ODINS: Or see you cut to pieces.
MARC: Better that!
MAN: And all the rest of us?
He's got my wife.
He's touching her.
My God, he's touching my wife!
Bear it, my son.
Slaves have no sons!
Who took my mother from you, coward?
Who's my father?
Toughen up your heart.
If she'd been gored by an ox, you'd tend her.
Try and forget the pain.
Who knows her better than you?
She's yours.
Since she was little, it was always Marc.
I couldn't sleep.
It's cold out there.
I feel rheumaticky.
DRACO: Good Father... you have pointy ears... you have sneaky eyes... eyes that lie in your stomach.
I couldn't sleep either.
We are all of us, good Father, made of the coarsest clay.
You, me, my stern and glorious brother up there in bed... though I'm sure he isn't sleeping.
I wonder whether the louse wasn't created... on the sixth day with man.
You, too, are a party to it.
And undeserving of the frock I wear.
But you see, Milord, l, too, am a man... and a louse.
Stand to attention!
You are a guard of honor!
The sun... like every other day.
You cried out last night.
I put my fingers to your lips, and you slept again.
I dreamt of my father.
He died when he came home and found his lands sold for ransom.
And I took up arms for the Duke.
He died in two halves.
First his right side, then his left.
He had me set my hands between his... dead hand and his live one and swear to keep his faith with the Duke.
I swore to protect my brother, to recover our lands...
But he was already dead.
From under his right hand,
I took that sword.
I've lived 20 years with that cold wife.
And off his dead finger,
I took this ring.
What are you doing?
Milord, it's dawn.
CHRYSAGON: They won't take you.
Not the Duke, nor the devil, nor all...
It could never, never be.
[Thud]
[Thud]
It's daylight in the swamps... or did you notice?
You look as though your fever's gone.
The elder... what's his name,
Odins... waits for her below.
Don't you hear me, Chrysagon?
It's over now.
I'll talk to him.
That old clown? Let him howl.
But there was an understanding with the Duke.
You've forgotten?
"Keep their good will," he said.
I'll not give her up.
I can't.
First, you run stallion-mad and trample our lives to pieces...
My life is my own.
Dear lord and brother, you are the Duke's most favorite jewel, his cosset.
Through you, comes everything.
All we have, and we must have something!
You've had the grain out of my horse's mouth, new armor that should have clothed my men.
Their blood paid for your fineries!
CHRYSAGON: My blood, too.
Bounty from the wars, each favor of the Duke,
I gave to you, all to you, wantoning at court, while I sweated inside that damn, dirty armor 20 years!
I've had nothing.
Nothing! Nothing!
You are our lord!
You cannot be a slave of a slave!
It sets the whole world turvy!
[Kicks door]
And look at her, this flower face, the sister of pigs!
This blazing whore.
That naked strumpet wears our father's ring!
Then honor it... and her!
She is mine.
You are bewitched.
You've had her... now keep her.
And may your soul be damned for it.
ODINS: Where is she?
He speaks of love, the sort of thing that songs are made of.
ODINS: Well?
He's not yet tired of his toy.
I must see Lord Chrysagon.
Don't ever touch me1
BORS: What are you waiting for?
Can't you see it's over?
Where is she?
Father... what I said last night... I'm sorry.
He had the right.
But now I have her back, l...
He keeps her!
No! Don't tell me of his rights!
He has none. Not now.
What can you do?
Do you want to be cut down?
They are warriors, boy.
You won't get by the door!
MARC: I have a sickle.
I killed a boar in the marsh.
I can kill a horse and a man.
ODINS; You'll never kill him, boy.
Killing's his trade; he was born to it.
MARC: I'll sink my sickle in his chest like a hook in beef.
I liked him.
You know that I liked him?
Norman or no, he seemed a man.
I'd have served him.
I raged last night.
I thought, "Well, he's higher than I am, better."
And she...
I'll strangle him in his own stinking guts.
But not alone.
Hark to what I told you.
Go over the water to the Frisians.
Take the boat in the fen, bring them back with you.
Why should they help us?
Because this half-sized Norman says they will?
No, you ditch dog... for the boy I told you of, the boy I took.
He's a prince of those people.
If they know he's in that tower, they'll take it down stone by stone to have him back.
A Frisian prince?
He told you that?
These did.
Take that to them.
I'll keep this to be a lord in.
ODINS: Go then, my son.
It can't be mended without blood.
I'll be back within the week.
She'll escape him somehow, no matter how close he keeps her.
Old woman, take it in.
[Thunder]
Where are the men from the village to work in the moat?
None came today, Lord.
Yesterday, only two.
The village elder,
I haven't seen him...
[Thunder]
[Falcon cries]
[Falcon cries]
CHRYSAGON: It's cold.
My love, you're shivering.
Do you know the stars?
CHRYSAGON: My father taught me to find my way by them.
I know only this village.
An now, only this tower.
CHRYSAGON:
Do you want to go back?
I can't leave you.
CHRYSAGON: I know.
Worlds wider than this tower,
I do know that road.
There's a place, a far place where I can carry you.
When?
Please? When?
CHRYSAGON: When all's done here.
I must hold this place awhile yet... for the Duke.
[Dogs barking]
The Frisians. They're back.
[Ring]
[Dogs bark]
[Horses whinny]
CHRYSAGON:
Tybald, get water to the roof.
Break some stones from the parapet.
BORS: Away!
MAN: War lord!
War lord!
The boy... or we cut your Norman throats!
Has the whole village joined them?
Nearly all, I fear, Milord,
God save their souls.
Isn't that your falconer, the little man?
Volc, too.
DRACO: So, Sir Flea has deserted us.
Oh, well.
Small loss, eh, Brother?
MAN: War lord!
The boy! My son!
DRACO: Your son, is he?
You gave my father back for a bucketful of gold pieces.
The same for your son, then, or take him without his head!
Can you put enough edge on that to cut your way out of this?
Oh, I know we're all safe in your strong hand... and do but trust in you and all will yet be well, huh?
Lie here with your wench, then,
Sir Chrysagon de la Cruex... until those pirates pull the Duke's tower into the swamp.
Draco, what would you do if you break the Duke's faith...
I break his faith?
You're the lord of this place.
"Hold it well," he told you.
And where are the dogs you hold it for?
Waiting outside your door with pitchforks.
- But you...
- What, Brother?
DRACO: Will you chop me with this great sword?
Well, it might be.
You're a tall, strong man.
Or I might chop you.
Neither way would make you right.
Now! Open it!
My brother's ridden for help... to the Duke.
It's ready!
Bow the tower doors.
Now!
We need a grappling hook.
BORS: There is none.
Milord!
BORS: The boat!
It could have an anchor.
Get me a rope!
Take a turn around that post.
- Not you, Bors.
- Why not?
I would as soon die a wet death as a dry one.
[Banging on door]
Steady.
Pull!
BORS: Hold! Hold!
BORS: Pull!
Pull, your heathen guts!
PRIEST: Will help soon come from Ghent?
Help?
Aye, if the Duke wills it'll come, soon or late.
But... but will it be in time?
Ha! Look, ye priest... if they rise early, move fast, and find us alive, then it will be in time.
Hmm!
CHRYSAGON: Up now.
Come on. Up!
Get ready.
Water!
CHRYSAGON:
It's no use. We'll go below.
Barricade the stairs!
If they overrun us down here...
[Pounding on door]
The horses!
Hah! Hah!
- Pour the oil!
- Oil!
CHRYSAGON: Block that doorway.
They haven't finished.
[Caw Caw]
CHRYSAGON: Tybald... sound the bell.
[Ring]
Now!
Go!
BORS: It's Draco with thunder!
PRIEST: Milord!
Ha Ha Ha!
Lord Draco.
DRACO: Hmm.
CHRYSAGON: Draco!
Our savior.
Oh, not yet. Those wild men are still in the woods.
They won't leave while we hold the boy.
DRACO: The can't take him now... so they must buy him.
Our dearest Duke gave me more than the men I saved you with.
He promised me half the gold our captive princeling brings.
Ransom?
Ho ho ho!
So the world turns, Brother.
As his father held ours, so we hold him.
We could sell him a pound at a time.
Mmm. Pity he's so small.
Well, any ear should do to show we are honest traders.
CHRYSAGON: Draco, let be.
I've had a bellyful of blood over this.
"Let be," is it?
Oh, no, Brother.
My glorious brother, no more.
The Duke's had a bellyful, too.
When I told him of the devil's brew you stirred up, he gave me your holding here.
Did I say it was a turning world?
You are lord here?
I am.
That little insect is mine to kill, maim, ransom as I see fit.
This village is mine.
As for the clods in it... they'll find what rebellion brings.
I'll give them empty sleeves and wooden legs...
- For what I did?
- Lf you like, Brother.
Carry it all on your broad back, your sins and mine.
Carry them to a monkery and pray your way to God's grace.
Or go to hell.
I've been there.
Then go on a quest for the Holy
Grail, and take that with you.
But first, my father's ring.
- The ring, I say!
- Draco!
Shall I take her finger with it?
I can't fight you, Draco.
Then I'll fight you.
Ahh!
Why?
While I ate the bread you earned in the wars... and rode the horse you gave me... and lived in the shadow of your sickening righteousness... because the Duke smiled on you...
Well, he's not smiling now.
Now I hold this place!
And you'll all swear your fealty to me.
Not while Milord lives.
Then your lord shall die.
This thing must be settled.
Draco.
I swear to you, Draco.
I swear by my father's...
Ring!
If you prefer butchery to combat, then butchery it shall be.
Draco!
My glorious brother...
Draco.
[Crash]
Come, boy.
Keep her with you... here.
Milady.
[Sounds horn]
[Frisians whooping and hollering]
Wait! Hold!
[Cheering]
For this gift of my son,
I'll give you all I can... rank, riches, land.
Cross the water with us.
No.
Why "no"?
Go with him.
You and she get clear of this mess.
I can't give up this place.
This place is no longer yours to give up.
It was Draco's for a moment.
The Duke will send another lord... to do what Draco promised, and what will you do to save her then?
Kill him... and then the next?
And then the Duke himself?
If you'd give mi... milady sanctuary...
FRISIAN: My roof is hers.
CHRYSAGON: I'll bring her.
BORS: You send her to the Frisians.
Such fierce nobility, hmm?
And then what?
CHRYSAGON: I go to the Duke.
BORS: The Duke?
Why, to make ghosts of us?
CHRYSAGON: To put what right all I've set wrong here.
BORS:
You talk like a ballad singer.
Do penance?
Plead for these marsh rabbits?
The Duke will have your head on a pole and mine along with it.
CHRYSAGON: Don't go, then, Bors.
You get free of this.
Your father sent me to ride at your back... when you were too small to reach the saddle.
God help me, I've ridden too many miles there to leave now.
Bronwyn!
[Horse whinnies]
Bronwyn!
Listen to me.
I can't take you to that... that far place.
Not for a while.
I'll be with you... always, wherever you go.
So you go now to the North.
No! I want to stay with you.
CHRYSAGON: No, you can't.
I have to stay here.
If you go, I go, too.
You stand up... now... and go, and we both go.
Oh, Bors. I'm tired.
I hurt.
Rainault!
Hold this place till... till I come back.
You hold it well.
A wedding in Germany
Fallingbostel, May 1969
Dear children, even though your stomachs are full, you can stand a little speech.
Thirty years ago, when your mother and I married, the sky was blue, but dark clouds were already looming on the horizon:
The clouds of World War Two.
All of us gathered here today hope with all our hearts that you be spared such suffering.
Clermont-Ferrand: 134,000 residents in the Puy-de-Dôme region.
The capital of Auvergne is 240 miles from Paris and 37 miles from Vichy, which was the capital of France from 1940 to 1944.
Gergovie, a nearby Gallic town, used to be the fortified town of Vercingétorix, conquered by Julius Caesar.
A father tells his children about a more recent defeat.
In 1939, I was 27 years old.
I was the father of a large family, so I hadn't been sent to the front.
The front was the Maginot Line.
I'd been sent to Montferrand, near Clermont, and my wife's dairywoman, Mrs. Michel, had criticized me for not going to the front.
So after the rout,
I told her that there was no point in me going to the front, since the front came to me.
Was there anything other than courage in the Resistance?
Of course. But the two emotions
I experienced the most frequently were sorrow and pity.
The Colonel was a French Action man, the Major was a moderate.
The Captain was all for the diocese, the Lieutenant couldn't stand the church.
THE SORROW AND THE PITY
Chronicle of a French city under the Occupation
All these men made excellent Frenchmen.
Excellent soldiers who march in time.
Thinking that the Republic is still the best thing going.
Now most of these strapping lads don't share the same political views.
But they all agree, no matter what their view...
Part 1: THE COLLAPSE
Two brothers, both local farmers, live a few miles from Clermont.
They have many memories of German occupation.
Is that your village?
That's where I was born.
I was born near that church there, and later I lived on the farm facing the school.
You can't help but love your country.
Did you think about it in Buchenwald?
Not much.
– You didn't?
– No.
– What did you think about?
– Surviving. That's it.
That's mainly what I thought about.
But I'm talking about me, about how I saw things.
I'm not talking about those who...
There were some people who cried.
When I saw them cry,
I knew that they would never make it.
No way.
You had to think about yourself first.
And think about others after.
This politician also has reasons to remember.
For me, it was an experience that I will never forget.
This experience may have had a few secondary effects, but I don't believe it has affected my attitude or behavior.
Has it not made you feel bitter towards certain French people?
No, I wouldn't say that.
It showed me that there are certain tendencies and habits, which, when they are fired, fed, or stimulated, crop up like weeds, and so we must always be on the defense.
We have to protect our youth from this type of propaganda.
We have to talk to them about it more than we talked about it a generation or two ago.
The manager of the Philips company also has reasons to remember.
As I was saying, his friends would ask me why I joined the Resistance.
Why? Because going into a restaurant and seeing Germans at a table, and being told there's only four steaks left for the Germans and none for us was a little frustrating, seeing as that steak came from our cows in Auvergne.
So it was our right to eat it before giving it away.
That's my first reason.
My second reason was that the Germans were forever imposing curfews.
It was, after all, a Nazi regime, a totalitarian regime, no matter how you look at it.
It was worth fighting for, it was even worth dying for, rather than to live as slaves. Hence, the Resistance.
Lasting peace is what we need.
There's nothing dumber than fighting.
That's what I think.
– Depends on what you're fighting for.
– Do you think they really knew?
– They didn't know?
– I doubt it.
There are a few fanatics who know why.
– Did you know why?
– Yes, I did.
– But you weren't a fanatic?
– No, but...
But when I went off to war in 1940...
I left in 1939, on September 2, and I was sent to Modane.
What could I have done?
I knew nothing. I was going to kill guys I'd never seen before, who had never harmed me.
Later, they did harm us when they arrived in France. They messed us up.
Even in moments of calm, the soldiers are ready to fight.
Faced with the enemy, they have the winning qualities of patience, courage, vigilance, determination, and confidence.
In right-thinking circles, in high society in Paris, they sympathized with our soldiers, whose troubles were unfortunately nothing compared to what came later.
And consequently, during this period, people sought to distract them, to entertain them, to relieve them from the boredom of the Maginot Line, where time passed at a snail's pace.
It must've been painfully boring.
So the right-thinking women of the Parisian bourgeoisie decided to form a committee to entertain our valiant soldiers, to provide them with a more pleasant view.
The idea was to plant rosebushes on the Maginot Line, to make it look prettier, to create a nicer atmosphere.
And there were people who donated money towards these rosebushes, so that our soldiers didn't have to look at the horrid, concrete walls, and to give them a flowery environment in which to live.
It's pathetic when you think about the awful things that came later.
The infantry is advancing at great intervals.
In Oisemont, the enemy has set fire to the tanks of an oil factory.
It took two weeks in Poland.
We felt it would be just as quick in France, as we were anxious to go home.
And, indeed, we took France in just one month.
And onwards it goes. Next stop: Paris.
Naturally, we attacked on several occasions, but the hardest time was in Oing, on the Belgian border.
The Belgian blockhaus weren't ready, but we had to take position in them.
The Germans arrived equipped with tanks.
All that we had were machine guns.
They proceeded to kill everyone inside, because it made such an easy target.
There were no battlements.
They hadn't even put up reinforced doors.
I'm telling you, we walked...
We withdrew, and we must have walked at least 20 miles, without running across any troops.
Not one single troop.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
First of all, I'd like to emphasize the fact that the German staff was not expecting to achieve such a quick, resounding success.
We soldiers, unlike Hitler, were convinced that we were facing the same adversary as in 1914-1918, a determined, brave adversary, prepared to fight to the bitter end.
Unfortunately, I must admit that Hitler was right in this case.
He was always saying how the French were incapable of repeating their performance in World War I, and he never missed an opportunity to add to this statement a few disagreeable and derisory remarks or comments on the general emotional and moral state of France.
GERMAN NEWS
Near Noyon, General Stummel, taking the vanguard with his troops, with his adjutant, took several prisoners.
It began with two.
Later, many others surrendered.
The prisoners come from every nation and every walk of life.
So-called defenders of the great nation.
In fact, a shame for the white race.
These are the Black brothers of the French.
In the words of Chamberlain,
“We, together with our allies, are the guardians of civilization.”
“Together we fight medieval barbarism.”
These are the guardians of civilization.
These are the barbarians.
This is the war of the Franco-English plutocrats.
They began this war rashly without taking any heed of the consequences, to fight for the English lords, not only until the last Frenchman, but until the last French house.
Mrs. Tausend, you stayed in Germany.
Did you read the papers?
Did you watch the German news?
Yes, we followed the events closely.
Naturally, we were a bit frightened.
But the news of victory made us happy.
These cars are stopped for a lack of gas.
The Jewish warmongers and Parisian plutocrats, with their suitcases full of gold and precious stones, have fled.
This shortage of gas put a crimp in their plans.
The streets were hopelessly blocked.
Yet these English-loving traitors and deserters continued their journey on foot.
These are the French people who have been mercilessly evacuated and dragged along in the flood of the routed French army.
Soon, these people will be able to go home.
The German people were spared such a trial, thanks to the Führer and his German soldiers.
During that time, there was an enormous upsurge of the people, who were completely panicked, terrified.
Fate willed that I should be given leave in the last few days of the month April.
Consequently, I was in Paris in early May when the Germans invaded.
On the roads, people were going mad, terrified by the bombings.
With them, they brought what they could:
Children, pets, precious objects...
Some rode on wagons, others on bicycles.
It was a mish-mash of everything and everyone. It was awful to see.
It was all the more awful in that the Germans, in an effort to block and ruin the roads for the soldiers didn't hesitate in bombing these columns of refugees.
As a result, and I can attest to this fact, that there were bodies strewn all over the place: Men, women, horses.
Car wrecks sprinkled the roads.
It was a scene from hell.
And yet this wave, this flood of people, continued to move south.
Our impressions?
We saw destroyed villages, burned lands...
It did have a certain effect on us.
– And the people on the roads?
– They were fleeing the bad guys.
What do you mean?
Weren't you the bad guys?
At first, we were seen as the enemy who was set to destroy the country.
Then they began to see that we just wanted to help.
And that reassured them.
The officers or the staff were clearly out of their depth.
Having the trains, the roads, and all telecommunications cut off led to a situation in which any plans the soldiers had made were suddenly completely ruined.
In addition, certain military circles shared the attitude of many civilians, and tackled the war unenthusiastically.
After all, they were living in...
I'm not saying they were traitors.
In any case, there were very few traitors.
But this attitude of preferring Hitler to Léon Blum was an attitude that had become very popular in bourgeois circles.
And this was a circle to which many of the soldiers belonged.
THE GREAT BATTLE OF FRANCE
On June 14, 1940, the Germans occupied Paris.
In Clermont, the papers went mad.
Le Moniteur took a stand, asking the people to stand up and fight, to resist, to remain free.
The owner of this anti-defeatist paper,
Pierre Laval, a deputy for Auvergne, was, at the same time, preparing for surrender.
The last government of the Third Republic slowly moved southwards.
Paul Reynaud wanted to keep fighting, but Philippe Pétain was already taking charge.
In Briare,
Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden met with their allies for the last time.
I've always felt that Reynaud wanted to continue, that he remained calm and firm.
Everyone was in a very difficult position then.
I also believe, and this is something he told both Churchill and me, that he wasn't very happy having Pétain as a part of his government.
– He'd foreseen the difficulties?
– Yes, already in Briare.
Now, I was a young soldier in World War I, and for me, Pétain was the hero of Verdun.
But his character had changed.
That's to be expected with age.
I'm sure he was opposed to the idea of your cities being destroyed, because he spoke of it at dinner, saying, “It's awful seeing our lovely cities destroyed.”
And I had to answer, “Yes, I understand.
“It's hard for an Englishman to say this, but there are worse things
“than the destruction of cities.”
But I don't think he was convinced.
We flew over France at a very low altitude.
– Hedgehopping?
– Yes.
In June, there's nothing quite like the Norman and Breton countryside.
And I remember, as if it only happened yesterday,
I remember thinking it was lovely, but would I ever see it again?
And it seemed rather unlikely that I would.
Then the political climate changed and became unbearable in Bordeaux.
Suddenly, treason was everywhere.
There was a will to surrender, and a desire to get along with the victors at any price.
Anglophobia, ever-present in France, resurfaced with new vigor.
And all this went hand in hand with a horrible kind of cynicism.
The military leaders, the ones who had messed up, weren't even mentioned.
Instead, people blamed absolutely everything on Léon Blum, the Front Populaire and so forth.
And so we consoled ourselves for the downfall of our nation by getting petty revenge in matters of internal affairs, a trend which, as you know, continued long afterwards.
On June 16, the government met in Bordeaux.
Paul Reynaud was defeated by the deputies who refused to leave France and Pétain became the head of government.
Adolf Hitler's elite S.S. Troops have invaded Vichy.
I felt terribly humiliated, as I had been sent on a mission on an English motorcycle and was heading to Paris, when I saw the Germans going the other way.
Now, being rather absent-minded,
I saw there were some people following these German troops, and assumed it was the English.
So they were going one way, and I was going the other.
I saw the swastikas on their helmets, and I thought I should go no further.
But no one asked me to stop.
Everyone was too busy going their own way.
If I didn't like it, tough.
The Resistance in Clermont was quickly crushed.
But the struggle, albeit subdued, continued.
Hitler's S.S. Division conquered Clermont-Ferrand.
German troops occupied the city for three days.
Zepp Dietrich, division commander, declared victory on Jaude Square, as his troops polished their boots in front of the locals, before heading off to new victories.
The Germans didn't return to Clermont until November 1942.
Our aim now is to take the arms depot in Etienne.
An entire infantry regiment has simply surrendered.
At first, I did the same as everyone.
I hadn't understood.
On the morning of June 24, the lieutenant declared that
Marshal Pétain had requested an armistice.
I knew what he meant by armistice, but I wasn't sure about “Marshal.”
I was never particularly in favor of Pétain's regime.
Nonetheless, like the other 40,000,000 Frenchmen who experienced that same moment, when I saw the rout, when I saw that the Germans were in Biarritz, and that France had been completely invaded,
I thought, like everyone else,
“Will anyone be able to end this massacre?”
People of France, as requested by the President of the Republic,
I shall henceforth be the leader of the French government.
Convinced of the affection of our admirable army,
whose heroism stands as testimony to our long military tradition
as they fight an enemy which outnumbers them,
convinced that our army's resistance
has fulfilled our duty towards our allies,
convinced of the support pledged by the former soldiers I led,
convinced of the French people's faith in me,
I give France the gift of myself,
to ease its troubles.
In these difficult times,
I think of the poor refugees,
who, in the depths of despair, trudge across our roads.
I extend my compassion and concern for them.
My heart is heavy as I tell you today that the fight must end.
Last night, I spoke with our adversary
and asked if they were prepared to help me, between soldiers,
after the fight, with honor intact,
to find a way to end the hostilities.
From the Führer headquarters a historical piece of news:
The prime minister of the new French government, Pétain has declared, in a broadcast to the French people, that France should lay down its arms.
Of course, I was happy to hear we'd won.
The defeat gave me the same feeling
I would get when I played rugby.
I don't like losing, especially when it's 60 to 0.
I hate drawn-out defeats.
This stone is a reminder of the humiliation of Germany on November 11, 1918.
Is it true that France had given England its word of honor that it wouldn't agree to a separate truce?
I think we... That was before
I was a member of government.
I think we had reached an agreement whereby neither party would cease fighting.
– Without the other party's consent.
– Right.
But we didn't discuss that at all when Churchill and I were there, because we accepted the position France had taken.
– In Briare, he said...
– That he'd accept an armistice?
No, he said we accepted the fact that you may not be able to go on.
Nothing was said about an armistice.
It's clear that between a ceasefire and an armistice, there's a big difference.
Exactly.
He simply said, “We understand that you cannot go on any longer.”
That was clear.
The question was quite simply,
“What are you going to do?”
I even sent Churchill a short letter after we returned from Briare, which has since been published, saying that we must make a clear distinction.
If the French can no longer fight, that's one thing.
But if they make it easy for the enemy, that's another.
La Madeleine. Early today in Paris, the Führer made an unexpected visit.
During his tour of Paris, he also visited this building.
Place de la Concorde.
The Arc de Triomphe.
Trocadéro.
A look at the Eiffel Tower.
On the Führer's left, Professor Speer.
One thing we should remember is that when France agreed to an armistice, even though we didn't want to lose, how many Frenchmen said,
“All's well that ends well.
So much the better.”
As for Marshal Pétain, he knew what he was doing in Vichy.
In every canton and every town, he formed what was called the French Legion.
– The Legion of Companions.
– It was meant for us veterans who'd fought in World War I.
Everyone, except me, went on Sundays.
I'm the only one who never set foot in there.
It's true.
They would attend the raising of the colors on the market place every Sunday, wearing their hammer and sickle. No, not hammer.
I don't mean the hammer and sickle.
What was it called again?
– The sword.
– Whatever.
They'd all been given a beret.
Can you imagine?
Of course, I never set foot there.
Not on your life.
But when I saw what happened,
I understood.
So suddenly, this old marshal suggests an armistice with French honor intact and so forth.
As a young Frenchman, do you feel the defeat was justified?
Does it not disgust you?
No, defeat was the inevitable consequence of French politics.
In fact, this was the theme propagated by the Vichy government.
If we were defeated, they claimed, it was because for so many years, we had to put up with party politics, which is the reason
France is in this situation today.
How did that phrase go?
“The parties which have harmed us so much...”
It was... No, that's not it.
– Something about lies.
– The lies that harmed us.
Right. “I hate the lies that have harmed us so much.”
At the same time, there was another appeal launched by de Gaulle, an appeal which apparently very few people in France heard.
I certainly didn't hear it.
But as a pilot, weren't you slightly tempted to...
I imagine that a certain number of people in the same unit as you chose to “continue the struggle,” as they said.
There weren't many who did.
Let's get it straight.
It's true that some people attempted to flee to North Africa.
Later, the situation stabilized.
Not so many fled.
Did it ever cross your mind to flee?
Of course.
But I didn't think about it for long.
My father quickly made me understand that Marshal Pétain guaranteed a new order, renewed honor, etc.
The victor of Verdun guaranteed
France's honor and the establishment of a new order.
This seemed not only desirable, but necessary, to many Frenchmen.
They respected and had faith in the Marshal.
In Clermont, the spirit of renewal filled
Pierre Laval's Le Moniteur.
Editorials sought those responsible for defeat and found them.
“Let's be French.
“Too much foreign influence has led to many problems.”
On June 26, 1940, in the magistrate's court,
René Mons was sentenced to three months in jail for defeatism.
Editorial.
We demand that those responsible be tried and an analysis of our problems ensue.
This quickly led to xenophobia,
Anglophobia and anti-Semitism.
Gaining French nationality became harder.
Vichy came out with the decree:
“The French elite must be restored.”
On that day, July 29, 1940,
Clermont butcher Antoine Labronne was tried and given a large fine for having sold rotting ham.
Did you ever speak about what the papers said back then?
– Never.
– Never?
We were totally cut off from the world, because there was one value that we all shared, and that was caution.
We didn't know what the butcher thought, or the milkman, or the engineer or the intellectual.
We had no idea.
Like everyone else, we stayed on our guard.
What do you think people's main concern was back then?
Food.
That took up most of your time?
Definitely.
Animals were illicitly butchered.
One needed a bit of meat to survive.
As you know, the French are very good at cheating.
One had to have a bit more bread than the usual ration, or a bit more tobacco by smiling nicely at the tobacconist.
A bit more of everything.
So every weekend, a regular parade of cyclists would go for supplies.
They had devised a system based on tickets, on ration cards.
Personally, I was a smoker, and it was awful not having cigarettes.
It was a horrible situation.
People would do anything, even steal.
I got so desperate that I even rolled artichoke leaves and smoked them.
The children who were born during that time, between 1942 and 1944, should have suffered from rickets, and I say this as a doctor.
In our family, it was ironic.
These young ladies have a brother, who is 27 years old, and was born in 1942.
He's six foot one!
We fed him so much to avoid rickets that he turned into a giant.
He's a great tennis player, an architect, and a giant to boot.
Are you what they call “a bourgeois” in a large provincial town?
If being bourgeois means eating properly, hunting in Sologne, having a hunting ground in Sanscoin and in Sérye, and a son-in-law who owns Lake Montciniére, then I'm a bourgeois.
When did you first begin to experience the consequences of the times, in other words, persecution?
How did you feel about that?
Did anything happen?
Not before 1942.
The only extraordinary event that occurred is that before the children were born, once again, in September 1942, the hunting season was re-opened.
What an event.
It was important to the hunters.
Game had been untouched for two years so there was an abundance of it.
It was a very satisfying experience for those who owned a gun.
In their little nests in the backyard, my little rabbits are so sweet.
Until recently, I hated hutches, and I despised and insulted our gentle little friends, now the center of our attention.
Just think, a rabbit!
Firstly, it will delight the cook.
And as its skin dries in the wind, the whole family rejoices.
Follow my example and give rabbit breeding a try.
As you can see, I love, you love, we all love rabbits in every form!
In reality, the French aren't normally very involved in politics.
Once in a blue moon, they decide to take action and storm the Bastille, or to fight religious wars for 50 years, or to initiate the French Revolution, or to set off to conquer Europe.
But, normally speaking, they're just as peaceable as anyone else.
One thing is for sure:
The French, in general, like a peaceful regime, a regime which has authority, but is preferably humane.
In any case, they feel the need to be protected.
They're quite paternalistic.
Does this explains Pétain's popularity?
Definitely. I might add that, as a sergeant in the French army,
I've seen a routed army.
And it's not a pretty sight.
There's no denying that, for some time,
Pétain was extremely popular.
He was viewed as one of the good old guys, perhaps a bit senile, but after all, he had given himself to France.
That was a clever way of putting it.
He gave the gift of himself.
So everyone thought that an old guy like him couldn't do any harm.
He could only help France.
At his age, what harm could he do?
These arguments, albeit feeble, were how people justified Pétain.
THE MARSHAL'S VISIT
I missed Mers-el-Kébir.
I only heard about what happened two weeks later.
I never understood Mers-el-Kébir.
Even now, having read many books on the subject of Mers-el-Kébir,
I still don't understand.
It was always a mystery to me.
Mers-el-Kébir was a mystery indeed.
Do you mean you don't understand why the English did what they did?
No, I never really understood the English.
After leaving Churchill,
I was a member in the House of Commons,
I went to the House of Commons, got my car, and drove myself through Hyde Park.
In the middle of the park,
I saw a group of French sailors, with their little red pompons on their kepis.
They were running and playing with an equal number of girls, or “young ladies” rather.
They were running and playing and screaming.
They couldn't understand a word of what the other was saying.
Then a horrible feeling swept over me.
It was sheer luck that I didn't crash the car, because suddenly I remembered
Churchill's ultimatum I'd just read, and I thought of those French boats in Mers-el-Kébir, where there were other sailors, also wearing kepis with little red pompons, and I wondered what was going to happen to them tomorrow.
These are the victims of the most base and loathsome attack ever.
Clearly, France's former ally only attacks those who cannot fight back.
On the morning of the attack,
Admiral Gensoul received the English ultimatum.
Admiral Somerville proceeded to send several delegations, in order to explain to Gensoul the options proposed by Churchill:
They could join the Free French, allow themselves to be disarmed, or head to a neutral port which was out of German reach.
Admiral Gensoul refused all three options, as he considered them dishonorable solutions.
What we didn't dare to risk happening was letting the boats fall into enemy hands.
We simply couldn't take the risk.
But wasn't there also a psychological risk?
Yes, a considerable risk.
It allowed the Germans to spread propaganda.
And Vichy, too.
Lord knows they used the opportunity.
I think we understood that, but at the time, we had very little choice in the matter.
There were 1,600 sailors killed by the British Navy.
The British Navy attempted to take over the French Navy.
That was clear to us at the time.
We thought that...
We believed the armistice would be respected by the Germans.
In France, we thought, as the Vichy government had told us, that the French Navy would never be given over to the Germans.
For us, that was a fact.
I was brought up to believe that promises were kept, and I just couldn't imagine that there could be political dealings that would eventually lead to the French Navy being given away.
There was no way.
So we viewed it as a brutal attack.
There was also an additional moral problem, in that, according to many testimonies, the sailors whose boats were shelled by the British believed at that moment they were going to cast off in order to join the British fleet.
That's terrible.
Had we felt there was any hope of that, we would never have attacked.
But there was no hope.
Everything we said about the Germans was proved in Bizerta, where the Germans proceeded to give the French admiral twenty minutes to surrender, to surrender boats and all, on pain of an immediate bombing attack, or of being taken prisoner.
Our predictions all came true.
We knew who we were dealing with.
It was then, shortly after these events, that the French, whose faith in the English had been greatly shaken, made contact with us for the first time, through General Huntziger at the Armistice Commission in Wiesbaden, to discuss the possibility of changing the armistice clauses to allow military collaboration.
And it was the discussion of such options, for which each side undoubtedly had its own personal motivations, that initiated the negotiations, which are now known as “collaboration.”
While the talks were beginning,
Hitler and Pétain agreed to meet in Montoire.
In our first meeting,
Laval told me he was a Germanophile.
And as he had known me for years, he asked me to put in a good word for him with Hitler. And I did.
I think Hitler felt Laval was sincere, at least in one aspect:
When he spoke of collaboration.
And that was the main issue at the second meeting.
In such cases, the defeated want to know what will become of them.
What will the peace treaty be like?
Whereas the victors I've often seen generally don't know what's next and cannot answer such questions.
That's how it went in Montoire.
Hitler didn't know how to answer Pétain's questions about boundaries or the fate of prisoners.
So it ended with everything up in the air.
Ah, Montoire... Now that was quite a story.
Where was this Montoire, anyhow?
Everyone was looking it up in the atlas to see where it was.
When we heard what had transpired, it was depressing.
Some even cried the next day.
– People were crying?
– Yes.
Soon afterwards, a new slogan became popular,
“Collaboration is:”
“Give me your watch,
I'll give you the time.”
That was the slogan.
That was collaboration.
He often said, also in my presence, that he hadn't yet decided whether England or France should pay for the war.
On the basis of his “race ideology,” or whatever you can call this point of view, many felt much more related to the English than to the French.
I am convinced that France, as Hitler saw it, could only play a minor role in a National Socialist Europe.
He had never been in France or anywhere else in Europe.
Whatever knowledge he had was derived from books, which had first been adapted to his point of view.
In his mind, he felt that a decline of the French people was unavoidable. And this idea was confirmed by the French defeat.
During his travels, Hitler sometimes shared his thoughts with others.
April 5, 1942. Suppertime.
The Führer says that if one plans on ignoring the terms of a contract, no use quibbling over details.
Hence, we must assure ourselves that the French are sincere.
No point in trying to pickpocket an experienced pickpocketer like the Führer himself.
In any case,
France's main task for the next 50 years is to repair the damage done at Versailles.
April 24, 1942. Suppertime.
The Führer says he is against marriages between the Wehrmacht and foreigners in occupied lands.
Such demands are generally based on sexual frustration, which is common in troops abroad.
He is struck by the contrast between the photos of the German men, and those of the women, who are very shabby looking.
The Führer feels that such marriages are doomed from the start, both in terms of individual happiness and racial purity.
He is more in favor of harmless passing fancies, which are inevitable in this type of situation.
The conditions created by
National Socialism within German structures at that time made it impossible for us to respect the clauses of the armistice.
We couldn't help what happened, any more than we could have helped all the other horrible things which continue to haunt any rational human being.
We couldn't stop Hitler and company from invading Alsace and Lorraine, making them a part of the Third Reich, and eventually incorporating their youth into the Wehrmacht.
This was all out of our hands.
We can reproach ourselves until kingdom come, but there was nothing we could do.
You say that after Russia, you were sent to Alsace, and then France.
Why? Was Alsace not France?
No. For us, it wasn't French territory.
The people were pro-German.
I even brought my whole family.
There were some people with bad intentions, some patriots who were ready to do anything.
But there weren't many.
So I felt like
I was in a country of German origin.
And now?
I've never gone back.
No, but what do you think of it now?
I think it's true.
I think it belongs to Germany.
Here a show is being put on for the S.S.
Bruno Fritz's amusing ice hockey report.
The German player is taken by surprise and falls down on... on the ice!
He stands up again. It feels too cold.
Thanks to Franco-German economic collaboration,
100,000 French workers now work in Germany.
Four trains leave the capital weekly and head for German industrial regions.
Today, at North Station, the war councilor Michel has come to shake the hand of worker number 110,000: Edouard Lefébvre.
Tell us, Mr. Lefébvre, were you unemployed?
– That's right.
– For how long?
It's been two years now.
– Are you married?
– With children.
This vast organization has already had good results:
Lower unemployment rates, and understanding between workers.
I'd worked for the Finance Minister and the State Secretary since 1923.
In 1940, Mr. Lansfried requested that I go to Paris, as head of the military-controlled finance division in occupied France.
He didn't want a National Socialist party member in this position.
Were you not a member of the party?
Yes, shortly before, I had joined the party, again at the request of Mr. Lansfried.
We tried to be as reasonable as possible, and as fair as possible, not only in our own interests, but in those of France as well.
This famous democracy, in the past 20 years, has proved itself incapable of eliminating such poverty.
The Third Reich, however, aims to provide its workers everywhere in Germany with healthy and beautiful hometowns.
This is a new settlement in a small industrial town, which naturally has a daycare center, a clinic, a center for mothers and children and an X-ray lab.
One gets the impression from such reports that German propaganda was quite open in its racial prejudice, and often implied that German discipline and structure were necessary qualities to clean up what was considered to be “the French mess.”
Yes, there is some truth in what you say.
In our offices in Paris, we also had a propaganda department.
But it received orders directly from Berlin.
And I would like to point out that, from the outset of my job...
It was the first ministerial-level visit from the French government, the Minister of Transport visited in September 1940.
He was accompanied by the owner of a racing stable, who wanted permission to begin horse racing again, as it was a very popular national pastime.
The races are ever-popular.
One thing is clear,
Paris has become Paris once again.
I listened to my collaborators and said, “Why not?”
And so the races started up again, and continued until 1944.
Thanks to us, the theaters were able to open their doors again.
We often went to the theater, alone or with friends.
The Germans also attended the races, which is how the different parties made contact quite spontaneously.
Personal relationships developed between the different sides, probably for various reasons.
I'm sure you're aware there has been a tendency in France since the war to deny that such contact ever existed.
Yes, but it did exist.
Germany was triumphant, and there wasn't a single front from which it failed to come home victorious.
There's no denying that the German army made quite an impression on the youth in France.
Seeing that army of young men, stripped to the waist...
After all, I'm the son of a soldier and I was a soldier myself.
A sense of responsibility, hierarchy and discipline mean a lot.
A well-disciplined army was important to people like us.
This was the first time we had seen such an ideal army.
The French army was nothing compared to this army who could put the fear of God into an entire people.
It sounds awful to say, but it's the truth of the matter.
We solemnly swear to unite and to place our forces, our faith, our ardor, at the service of the Marshal, at the service of France.
This campfire draws a three-day meeting to an end, during which the discipline and dedication of these young men were proved once again.
The French believe servicemen should be tough as nails, and at the end of the day, they always turn to servicemen, whether it be to restore order, to prevent a coup-d'état, or to organize a coup-d'état.
But the serviceman is omnipresent, with his cap, his pompon, his saber, no matter what his rank may be.
The French love their army.
Poem by Officer C. Languillon, published on the front page of
Le Moniteur on November 24, 1940.
“His name rings as a gunshot.
“Pétain ready for the challenge?
The soul is willing.
“But goodness is ever aloof.
“The great victor, even greater in defeat.
“Schemers, foreigners, buffoons and fools,
“have brought you to your knees, O France.
“The hero of Verdun, cleaning the slate,
“Is setting our house in order from top to bottom.
“A Herculean labor, a difficult recovery.
“From the ruins come muffled groans.
“Former profiteers writhe in the rubble.”
Pétain, in a series of speeches, drew conclusions from this defeat.
And he did so with skill.
He could woo his audience.
If one was to read the texts now,
I haven't read them in years, but I bet if you read them now, you would be quite surprised.
Yes, the texts relied heavily on the people's collective unconscious.
Absolutely right.
– He blamed the parliament.
– Yes, the parliamentary system...
Certain employers were suspect... foreign... cosmopolitan, not to mention dark-skinned.
And of course, he blamed the Communist Party.
The Communist Party was the cause of all evils.
All hotels were requisitioned, and the Park Hotel was occupied by Marshal Pétain and his staff.
This is where I met up with my friend,
Colonel Gorosse-Tardou, who lived with Pétain.
He was the chief of staff for his aviation department.
Consequently,
I was often at the Park Hotel.
It was always busy, with lots of people milling around.
Everyone kept their voices down and spied on their neighbors.
Personally, I wasn't used to their system, but when I spoke,
I followed everyone's example.
They were forever shushing one another.
– Everyone was very suspicious.
– Of the enemy or of one another?
A bit of both.
Are you a Republican?
Not really.
– Not really?
– No.
You're more of a Monarchist?
Yes, that's right.
French news. Late 1940.
Pilot-sergeant Gonthier de Basse, veteran of WWI, volunteer in '39, hurt in Dunkirk, has, of his own free will, agreed to make the following declaration.
Ever since my return from England aboard The Sphinx on October 5,
I've been surprised by the number of my compatriots who still believe the wounded in Narvik and Dunkirk were all well-treated by our ex-ally and this is why I've decided to share my memories with you.
When we arrived in England, we harbored no grudge against our English comrades.
But after the tragedy in June, when we were invited to come serve under a new flag, when they offered to pay us our dues in pounds sterling, we could only reply with disdain and indignation.
We French soldiers can only serve under our own colors.
Anything else would be treason.
Fellow Frenchmen, comrades, our duty is to stand side by side behind our leader, Marshal Pétain, to guarantee France a place of honor in a new Europe, and to allow the prisoners to return home immediately.
It is a difficult task.
Those who try to divide us are enemies.
United we stand, divided we fall.
The idea was to get out of the war, come what may, as quickly as possible.
There were 15,000 French sailors in Liverpool.
I went and spoke to them.
I tried to persuade them to continue the war.
But there was no way.
We were so low on people that we needed them to dig the trenches, and we offered them wages to do so.
They said no.
They said, “France is no longer in the war.
“We no longer have the right to dig trenches.”
You see... the kind of attitude they had.
Their desire to get out was almost spiteful.
As for what would become of England, they didn't give a care.
That's the kind of attitude they had.
They felt that it was inconceivable that the English succeed where the French army had been beaten.
On June 17, 1940, the steam liner Le Massilia headed from Bordeaux to Morocco.
Several parliamentarians were aboard.
This event caused much ink to flow.
I boarded Le Massilia without suspecting that it was a big trap.
Those who stayed behind in Bordeaux quickly understood that they could exploit the circumstances, and influence the public to think that the departure of the boat and the fact that a number of politicians were aboard, was a sign we were panicking, running away, abandoning them.
In other words, deserting.
The people aboard Le Massilia who actually wanted to fight were quickly judged to be cowards who were fleeing the fight.
It was paradoxical that some of us, including Viénot, Jean Zay, Wiltzer and I, were tried for desertion, when in fact their original plan had been to go fight.
And as far as I was concerned,
I was almost obliged to go, seeing as my unit had gone, and it was my duty to follow them.
Everyone wound up in Rabat.
There were tons of people.
Once there, I went to lunch at “Balima,” Rabat's best restaurant, where everyone met.
One of my cousins,
Du Jonchay, a pilot, was there, and naturally we discussed what had happened.
He showed me Pierre Mendès-France, who was sitting at a table with a lovely woman, who was his wife.
My cousin turned to me and said,
“Our State Secretary there is responsible for our defeat.”
There he sat, our little lieutenant, drinking champagne.
That champagne completely infuriated me.
I walked up to him, and told him this was no attitude to have, after being defeated, drinking champagne in public as if he was delighted about what had happened.
Then what?
I told him if I saw him again, I would kick him out.
And I gave him my card.
– It caused quite a stir.
– You were picking a fight.
No, I simply gave him my card to let him know who I was.
Not to hide my identity.
How did he react?
He got up, stood to attention, and said nothing.
I was a captain, he was a lieutenant.
I see.
There was surrender and treason.
But anti-Semitism had also begun to rear its ugly head.
Many who used to hide their feelings openly declared their anti-Semitism to the point that France began adopting certain German values, and sought to get closer to Hitler, in the hope of creating a Europe where
France and Germany would collaborate and obviously anti-Semitism became a common element between many Germans and Frenchmen.
And, of course, Jean Zay and I had the misfortune of being Jewish.
Actually, I was Jewish.
Jean Zay was only partly Jewish.
He had converted, as had his father, but he was of Jewish origin.
This didn't detract from the atrocious campaign against him, which, as you know, ended in his being killed.
Jean Zay was arrested.
His pregnant wife was in Casablanca.
She had a very tough time to find a hospital bed, or even someone willing to help her give birth.
There was such hatred.
When clinics or hospitals heard that she was Jean Zay's wife, they didn't have the courage to admit her.
You can't imagine how rampant sectarianism had become.
In any case, Mrs. Zay's pregnancy was certainly a very trying time.
She lived with my wife and they spent many long hours together during which they were abused and insulted.
My wife also had a very rough time of it.
Anyhow,
Madeleine Zay eventually gave birth to this baby, whom I had the opportunity to meet, as I was arrested shortly after the baby's birth.
And when I was transferred to Clermont-Ferrand, where I met up with Jean Zay,
I'd seen his daughter and he hadn't.
JEAN ZAY
To Appear In Court Tomorrow
The committing magistrate was
Colonel Leprêtre.
I don't want to name names, but this man's reputation lives on today.
The man was very intelligent, very bright, clever and cunning, but he had a very perverse side to him, in that he harbored great hate for the accused, especially if the accused was left-wing.
He got a certain morbid pleasure from seeing an important man accused.
Even outside of cross-examination, he would sometimes visit the prison, just to sit and chat with the prisoners.
He would go in their cells, and sit on their beds, pretending to speak with them simply.
He clearly got a great deal of pleasure out of holding the fates of such formerly important men in his hands.
There was something very sick, very odd about it.
A strange man.
So he would confess to certain things in moments of relaxation?
One day, he said to me,
“I know what you think of me.”
The man was bright enough to understand.
Very intelligent.
He said to me,
“I know what you think of me,
“but in an organized society, there are certain tasks,
“tasks which must be done, and which require people to do them.”
“Every society needs garbage men.”
He chose that word.
Were you able to emphasize the racial and political background and motives to the trial?
No, our main concern was to obtain satisfying results, and we knew that these judges wouldn't appreciate such arguments.
Even if we had said that his being Jewish should have nothing to do with the trial, we knew perfectly well that it would be a major issue.
The hearing was extremely tense.
It began at 9.00 a.m. With an introduction by Pierre Mendès-France, which the Colonel received with obvious contempt.
He had been given a table and a jug of water.
He began with the following introductory statement:
“Colonel and gentlemen,
I am Jewish, I am a Freemason,
“but I am not a deserter.
May the trial begin.”
The court was presided over by a rather frenzied man, called Colonel Perret, a colonel in charge of tanks, who harbored a particular hatred for General de Gaulle, because they had served in Saint Cyr together and were both competitive.
He hated anything to do with de Gaulle,
Gaullism or Gaullists.
Furthermore, he was a very frenzied character, who ran the hearings in an atrocious manner.
My sentence was nothing compared to the death sentences he gave out.
He was responsible for executions, which is considerably worse than the sentence he gave me.
I must say that those present at the hearing were extremely hostile.
The audience had been rigged, no two ways about it.
Women whose faces were filled with hate.
I won't name any names, but they were hateful people, people who were hoping for the cruelest of sentences, who were hoping I'd be killed immediately, who didn't think I should even be allowed to defend myself.
Some 300 or 400 entry cards had been delivered, but only six were for the defense.
The cards were quite a story.
As only a limited number existed, and they were in high demand, a new black market developed.
There were bistros in Clermont that hawked the cards.
Flatteringly enough, they were very expensive, twenty francs for the show.
It cost more than the movies.
There's no denying that public opinion was strongly influenced by the papers at that time, which felt that the politicians who were accused should automatically be declared guilty.
My colonel, my lieutenant-colonel and my general all took the stand and said, “He didn't desert.”
When the commissioner, whose name I won't give either, stood up and announced in a choked voice that he was sentenced to six years for desertion,
Mendès told him,
“Sir, I'm sure you'll be rewarded.
“You've served the master well.”
Former State Secretary
Sentenced to six Years in Jail for Desertion
I don't know if Rochat told you that a man came to see him the next day.
And this man told him,
“I'm a Pétain supporter,
“and I am appalled by what happened yesterday. It's scandalous.
“The Marshal must not be aware that such things are happening.
“The Marshal must be informed of such goings-on.
“I saw you stenograph the hearing.”
Which indeed he had.
“Could you get a copy for me to bring to the Marshal himself?”
Rochat gave him a copy which he took to the Marshal.
Naturally, nothing ever came of it.
And the man who took the copy was a certain Mr. Giscard d'Estaing.
It is these children, the pupils of French schools, in whom the Marshal sees hope for our country.
He has come to speak simply, as only he can, in a modest school in the town of Périgny.
You may sit down now.
You don't have to stand to listen.
Young pupils of our French schools, the reason I wanted to speak to you today on this day as you begin a new school year, is that it's important for you to know that I am counting on you to help me rebuild our country, France.
So work hard, stand firm, and do your best.
All rise.
I had to pass through Vichy to reach my posting in Billancourt in the first two weeks of August 1940.
Many people told me that Marshal Pétain was very tired, and was only lucid for two hours a day.
Imagine my surprise when I met this man, who, although elderly, stood bolt upright, with his look of steel, which many people have commented on, and with the greatest of ease, politely asked me to sit down and make myself comfortable, then said, “Mr. Lamirand, there's been much talk about you here.”
The secretary general of youth,
Mr. Georges Lamirand recently visited Lavalette camp, the main goal of which is to train the men of tomorrow.
He visited these young men who are united by a common ideal, and live life in continual contact with nature, work and simplicity, these values upon which we must rebuild our country.
We talked and I thought to myself,
“What bad luck.
“They say he's only lucid two hours a day, and I chance upon those two hours.”
The problems of youth are fascinating, but I had absolutely no idea that, in the position
Marshal Pétain wanted to grant me, there were so many fascinating subjects and problems to solve.
Repeat after me: Long live France!
Long live the Marshal!
Louis Renault finally agreed to give me leave, saying to Pétain,
“I'll lend him to you for a month.”
And Marshal Pétain, in his infinite cleverness,
“Fine, one month.
“But if you don't mind, let's make the job renewable.”
And he renewed it 30 months.
Mr. Lamirand is inaugurating an exhibition of drawings sent to Pétain by French schoolchildren.
The little ones wanted to answer the Marshal's call, they wanted to show the Marshal their towns, villages and homes, hence sharing a piece of their daily lives with him.
A school girl, perhaps the youngest in France, had the luck of being allowed to give Pétain her lovingly written letter in person.
It was about adding a new element to the famous triptych of the time:
Work, Family, Nation.
Honor your work, your family, and your nation.
A national revolution?
You said it.
Marshal Pétain has already told you several times what he meant by social revolution.
He feels that our social system is unfair.
There is too much poverty, too much injustice.
And that is what he wants to change.
He is bound and determined to bring happiness to France, and asks us all to join in a communal effort.
Dear friends, this is his social revolution.
That was when he started planning his escape.
He grew his beard, shaved it off, grew it out again, and one fine day, he left.
I must admit I'm not very athletic, but I prepared myself by working out for several months beforehand.
I was high up, so I had to jump off a high wall.
But I had to run the risk.
And once I had jumped,
I would be a free man again.
Just as I was about to jump...
There were trees planted along the avenue.
I heard the unexpected sound of voices.
I tried to see in the semi-darkness.
There was a couple sitting under a tree.
You can imagine what they were discussing.
He knew what he wanted, but she hadn't decided yet.
It seemed to last an eternity to me.
She ended up saying yes, but I had the impression she had put up a great deal of resistance.
Finally, they left. And so I jumped.
And let me assure you that I was even happier than he was.
I'd really like to meet him someday and let him know how much I experienced with the two of them that night.
How you admired his audacity.
Yes, and how her lack of audacity struck me as being so untimely.
Anyway, love, fate and escape eventually won the day.
Did you disguise yourself?
I was disguised, but not very well.
You see, many people back then who wanted to disguise themselves would let their beards grow.
So, bearded men automatically arose suspicion!
I let my moustache grow,
I gave myself a new hairstyle, parted straight down the middle.
I got a pair of glasses.
And of course,
I changed the way I dressed and so forth.
The next day,
I went for my daily visit with him, to see if he had escaped or not.
I arrived and saw all these people with decameters in hand, taking all sorts of measurements.
They were hysterical.
They asked me what I wanted.
I said I was there to see my client.
They asked if I knew
Pierre Mendès-France had left. I said no.
I burst out laughing, which made them angry.
They carried out a huge security check of all the roads and trains.
But my plan was to not contact anyone, to not count on anyone, to be cut off from everything and everyone.
I must say that life in France at that time is very difficult to imagine, and even more so to describe.
You had an old pair of shoes you hoped would last.
If they got a hole, there was no leather to fix them.
There were no plates, there were no matches, there was nothing.
It is very difficult, in hindsight, to describe what it was like living in a country where everyone was always searching for everything.
The new rage in Paris is silk stockings without the silk.
All you have to do, ladies, is dye your legs.
It's easy and practical. A great idea.
The ladies are trading in their garters for paintbrushes.
Worried about what will happen when you bathe?
No problem.
Paint-on stockings are waterproof.
On top of that,
Elizabeth Arden guarantees they won't run!
That's a Parisian habit which will disappear.
Where is France headed?
Where is Europe headed?
Some 3,000 people in Chaillot will hear
Mr. Alphonse de Chateaubriant discuss The French Drama.
At this very moment, a huge continental unit is slowly taking shape.
It will be one gigantic geographical piece in the puzzle, with one single political and economical doctrine, stretching to the very tip of Europe, the very tip of which is France.
Therein the importance of France becomes clear, as France becomes, in this new division, the outer edge, the last bastion on the Atlantic of this immense continent, faced with another large continent,
America, which is ready to take over the ancient order of things, the ancient riches and capitalist creeds, the ancient gold and the ancient man, in order to make it their last refuge, their last fortress, and their last army.
I sincerely hope that everything I have said tonight will give the word “collaboration” new meaning in your eyes.
It's not surprising that, at first, such poison won over many new converts.
Little by little, people began to realize it was propaganda, and to see that the government was practicing a policy, which they themselves called collaboration with the enemy.
Slowly but surely, people began to open their eyes, and change their minds.
But this propaganda still won over many new converts.
You know as well as I do that anti-Semitism and Anglophobia are never hard to stir up in France.
Even if reactions to such things are dormant or stifled, all it takes is one event, one incident, one international crisis or one Dreyfus affair, for feelings we thought long gone to suddenly re-emerge in full force, for beliefs we thought dead to be simply dormant.
Edouard Drumont was the first in France to examine the Jewish question.
The Institute of Jewish Questions celebrates his memory today.
Mr. Laville has agreed to say a few words.
Out of 100 Frenchmen of old stock, at least 90 are pure white, free of any other racial mixture.
This isn't true of the Jews.
The Jews are born of a mixture which dates back thousands of years, between Aryans, Mongols and Negroes.
Therefore, Jews have unique faces, bodies, attitudes and gestures.
It is reassuring to see that the public is interested in studying the characteristics presented in the morphological section of “Jews and France.”
In October '40, when I came home on leave,
I heard that a good friend of mine, a teacher, wasn't allowed to keep teaching that fall, because his mother was Jewish, making him half-Jewish.
I'd met Jews before, but I treated them the same as Catholics, Protestants, or people with no religion in particular.
It wasn't a revolution yet, but it did give me food for thought.
– Did you have any Jewish teachers?
– Let me see...
We did have one.
Yes, he was fired.
The same old story.
No one ever told us anything.
Listen, I think we should make a little nuance here.
I think that when you take cases like this teacher we mentioned,
I think that we tried, to the best of our ability, to get these people some work tutoring and so forth.
We did that for another colleague, too.
Like you say, it wasn't much, but we did have sympathy for them.
Did you really try?
Did every single teacher in Clermont give in their resignation?
No way. You've no idea what the mentality was like back then.
A collective resignation? Come on!
In 1940, Vichy came out with the Jewish decrees.
In the small ads of Le Moniteur, a local merchant announced that he was 100% pure French.
Sir, are you Marius?
Yes, I'm Marius.
You're weighed down with medals.
I fought in World War I.
– They're all medals from WW I?
– That's right.
You must be a very brave man.
I followed the others. I did my duty.
When France was demobilized, when France was defeated in the 2nd war, how did you react?
We certainly weren't very happy.
As veterans of World War I, the defeat affected us deeply.
Were there many Jewish stores?
Yes, there were.
So you must have seen a lot?
You could say that.
They all packed up their bags and left.
They went into exile.
And there weren't any arrests?
There were arrests everywhere.
And you saw them?
Yes, unfortunately.
Tell me, when what were called
“the Jewish decrees” came out, apparently you took out an ad.
That's correct.
It was an ad in Le Moniteur.
You're certainly well-informed.
You see, sir, we were four brothers.
It was the solution I found, as people thought we were Jews.
My name, Klein, sounds quite Jewish.
But I'm a Catholic.
And this was a real source of concern.
I had some problems because of that.
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
It was important that I tell people that I am really French.
In other words, you wanted your clients to know you weren't Jewish.
That is correct.
Why?
Because some said I was Jewish.
Jews were being arrested, and they said we were Jewish.
Do you see?
I couldn't very well allow myself to be labeled as a Jew since I'm a Catholic.
So that's why, as you said,
I took out an ad.
Four of my brothers fought in the war.
One was killed.
– The other three were imprisoned.
– But Jews fought in World War I, too.
That's true. I realize that.
I've never been a racist.
Jewish or Mahometan, all that mattered to me was that the man did his duty, in which case, he was as French as the rest of us.
You understand?
You weren't high on the priority list of those persecuted by Hitler's regime.
But did you know any Jews,
Communists, or Freemasons who were?
I met more Jews than I'll ever meet again.
I had two girls working at the pharmacy, who were considered to be evil just because they were Jewish.
One was the daughter of an amazing man, a Parisian polytechnician.
She was a pretty amazing girl herself.
The other was the daughter of Hirsch, a colleague in Strasbourg.
Nobody wanted anything to do with these girls.
He had warned every pharmacy in Clermont not to hire these girls.
– Who is “he?”
– The pharmacy inspector.
The movie industry gave them a chance to steal billions of francs.
Tannenzaft, better known as Nathan, who in the eyes of the world, was the ultimate symbol of French cinema, has cost the public nearly 700,000,000 francs.
Mr. Pierre Mendès-France, did you enjoy going to the movies back then?
I went to the movies because I enjoyed it, but I had yet another reason, as I had quickly discovered that movie houses provided a refuge which was both fun and comfortable, you could sit down in a movie theater at 3:00 in the afternoon, and stay there in the darkness for hours on end, without anyone ever seeing you.
It was a great hiding place.
In many pre-war French movies, there were Jewish actors or Jewish directors.
And in the credits of these movies, the Jewish names had been erased.
Today World News was able to film a part of the trial of the Jew Tannenzaft, Bernard Nathan.
Our presence clearly disturbed the accused who wanted his privacy.
He raises an objection, but is overruled by the court.
Go away. Leave me alone.
This is a tragedy, not a comedy!
The Germans were discreet about it, but they wanted to see their movies.
There were operettas.
There were the first movies in color.
Some, like La Ville Dorée, weren't propaganda, others were.
Films like Le Juif Suss were pure propaganda.
And the thing that I found most revolting was that they weren't only German productions, which would have been understandable since they had occupied us, but that they were made with the blessing of the French authorities, on behalf of French organizations, dubbed by French actors.
The events in this film are based on historical fact.
At first, movie-goers probably thought these movies were just like any other German movie.
But people very quickly began to realize that it was just typical propaganda, in the worst sense of the word.
This led to a kind of strike among viewers.
Even those who weren't especially interested in the Free French, who had gotten into the habit of seeing normal German movies, were extremely revolted and refused to have any part in it.
Gentlemen, this Jew's criminal record shows nothing of the suffering of our people during his tyranny.
This is why I give the floor to the person who has suffered most.
I ask for nothing.
You are the judges, not me.
Please, Sturm, you are the one with the most right to judge him.
It is not my decision to take.
Suffering is too subjective.
It would be unfair.
However, I see an ancient article of criminal law which applies:
“If ever a Jew commits a sin...
“If ever a Jew commits a sin of the flesh with a Christian woman,
“he shall be publicly hung without further ado.”
“If ever a Jew commits a sin of the flesh with a Christian,
“he shall be publicly hung without further ado,
“as punishment, and as an example for all others.”
Have mercy! I've done nothing wrong!
I've always acted in the name of my savior!
It's not my fault that your duke wanted to betray you!
I can fix everything, I swear. Everything!
Take all that I own. Take all my money.
But don't take my life!
I am innocent!
I'm just a poor Jew. Let me live.
I want to live!
I want to live! Live!
The State Council and I speak for all Wurtemburgers in decreeing that all Jews must leave Wurtemberg in the next three days.
This is valid across the entire country.
This decree has been taken in Stuttgart on February 4, 1738.
May our descendants remember this, for in doing so, they will spare themselves much pain and suffering, and will keep their blood pure of the influence of this accursed race.
THE END
There were only certain people who actually enjoyed Le Juif Suss, the anti-Semites who saw their beliefs confirmed in the movie.
The collaborators would also see it.
Then there were those who were taken by surprise.
I'd say that 80% of the people who came to see Le Juif Suss assumed it would be just like any other light-hearted movie.
The German films weren't particularly good.
However, they featured many French film stars, as Continental had made many French films before the war.
Tino Rossi and the like filmed at Continental.
As an artistic endeavor, several actors are off to Germany.
At East Station, we've spotted Albert Préjean.
Danielle Darrieux.
Suzy Delair.
Junie Astor.
Viviane Romance.
Dr. Karl Fröhlich, president of the German Cinema Corporation, has invited them on a 12-day studio tour of Vienna, Munich and Berlin.
Today Mr. Heydrich, general of the S.S. And head of security, was sent to Paris by Mr. Himmler, chief of the S.S. And the police, to officially install Mr. Oberg in his new post in occupied territory.
Mr. Heydrich is president of the International Criminal Police, a commission to which
France has always belonged.
Mr. Heydrich visited Mr. Bousquet, secretary general of the police, and Mr. Hiller, secretary general of administration.
He also had a chance to see Mr. Dartier de Pellepoix, in charge of Jewish Questions, as well as Mr. De Brinon.
What was Paris like back then?
There were two sides to Paris.
There were those struggling to survive, and there was high-society.
All we were missing was Régine.
There's no doubt about it.
Everyone's ashamed to say it today, but for some, life in Paris was great.
Maxim's and Le Boeuf sur le Toit did a booming business.
The movie industry was in full swing.
From what I've heard, actually, or so they say,
French films were so good then because a certain category of producers had fled to the States.
Many directors have gone on to do very well in their careers, but they forget what they said then.
Paris was a fun and crazy place.
Let me assure you that there were some wild and crazy times back then.
All right, boys. This way.
We'll go straight to the source to whet our whistles.
What happened to you in 1937?
You can't even begin to imagine.
– It's a long story.
– Be careful...
First give us a drink, then we'll see what's up.
I think we're going to earn our drink today.
– Is that red wine?
– Yes, it's as Red as I am.
So what happened in here?
This cellar has seen everything.
The Resistance in Auvergne began here.
The night the first weapons arrived, we met in this very cellar.
And we sang the Internationale.
We weren't Communists, but as Pétain sang the Marseillaise, we had to sing the Internationale.
You see, people attended the raising of the colors reluctantly.
– Yet they still came?
– They had no choice.
It is in times like those when you begin to realize what people are really like.
– How do you mean?
– They were scared stiff.
With only a few exceptions.
– Was it really a risk not to come?
– Risk or no risk, they still came.
– So they thought there was a risk?
– They thought so.
I was under the impression that there were quite a few students here who ardently supported General de Gaulle.
For example, there was the son of a colleague whose name escapes me, among others.
What about among the teachers?
I really can't say how many teachers supported him.
We were sympathetic to the young people's cause, but there wasn't the same enthusiasm... the same enthusiasm which was gaining momentum among the young people.
Why do you think that is?
It often seems to be the case in life.
Young people are, in general, more sincere and more dynamic.
They don't think things through.
I think it would be fair to say that they are less cautious.
They are more open and friendly.
What do you think?
– They're not as scared.
– True.
Some of my students got caught.
I can't really say who.
Not so many, just a few of them.
In fact, many of them now have streets named after them here.
There was Bacaud.
The street going to Fontviége is named after him.
– I taught this charming boy.
– He was in the Resistance?
These people, as Dionnet was saying earlier, had created a network.
We only found out about it later.
They continued to pretend they were just your average students.
But we only found out about this later.
Perhaps Dionnet, who was in the Resistance, knew.
What was it like for the others?
How did the others react when someone's desk was empty?
I don't know. I can't remember.
When a student's parents were arrested, and the son showed up at school the next day, how did they react?
– I can't remember.
– How can you forget?
Can you remember?
No, I can't.
No specific examples.
I see some examples on the wall.
Those are our former students...
Aren't those the students who died in World War I?
It says World War II.
I'm trying to remember, but I can't.
Clermont-Ferrand is giving
Marshal Pétain a warm welcome.
He has come to approve the constitution of the Peasants' Union, and the end of the winter crusade for National Aid.
The head of state will then receive the donations to National Aid brought by peasants from all over the region.
It is a symbolic ceremony for the French mutual aid campaign.
A great day for France as our hearts beat together in collective hope.
This is Spain...
one thousand and eighty years after the coming of Christ.
It is a war-torn, unhappy land...
half Christian, half Moor.
This is the time and the story of Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar...
known to history and to legend as El Cid, "The Lord."
He was a simple man who became
Spain's greatest hero.
He rose above religious hatreds...
and called upon all Spaniards, whether Christian or Moor...
to face a common enemy who threatened to destroy their land of Spain.
This enemy was gathering his savage forces...
across the Mediterranean Sea on the north shores of Africa.
He was the African emir, Ben Yusuf.
The Prophet has commanded us to rule the world.
Where in all your land of Spain is the glory of Allah?
When men speak of you, they speak of poets... music makers, doctors, scientists.
Where are your warriors?
You dare call yourselves sons of the Prophet?
You have become women!
Burn your books.
Make warriors of your poets.
Let your doctors invent new poisons for our arrows.
Let your scientists invent new war machines.
And then, kill!
Burn.
Infidels live on your frontiers.
Encourage them to kill each other.
And when they are weak and torn...
I will sweep up from Africa... and thus the empire of the one God, the true God Allah...
- Allah is the one God.
- Will spread.
First, across Spain.
Then, across Europe.
Then, the whole world!
Heavenly Father, we are lost and in darkness.
Once again they destroy our towns... take our people in bondage.
Please help us, Father.
Send us someone... who will take us to the light.
Father. Here. Come.
The Cross.
The Cross.
We couldn't save your village...
but we captured their leaders.
Who are you?
Rodrigo Diaz of Vivar.
Vivar?
You're a long way from home.
Sir, you are not dressed for battle.
This was to have been my wedding day, Father.
How is it you came here, my son?
I thought this would be the shortest road to my bride.
We are ready, my lord.
Do we hang them now?
No, Fanez.
They come to Vivar with us.
No! Stop!
Fernando, put down those stones!
Welcome home, my son.
Here are some Moorish prisoners for you.
We didn't expect such wedding guests.
Are you holding them for tribute?
They're your prisoners, sir.
They're yours.
You captured them.
You must decide what is to be done with them.
Hang them! Now!
We are emir... kings.
There will be a great ransom for you if you let us live.
You were ready enough to kill.
It would seem you're less ready to die.
I am ready, my Lord Rodrigo.
I have no great desire to live to see what is coming for all of us.
What is coming for all of us?
Wars, death and destruction.
Blood and fire more terrible than has ever been seen by living man.
Don Diego, I will take your prisoners back to the King at Burgos.
They are not my prisoners.
They are my son's.
Oh, forgive me, Don Rodrigo.
Then it will be your prisoners we will hang in the palace square at Burgos.
We will hang their bodies high as an example to other Moors!
Don Ordonez, these prisoners will not go to Burgos.
The King will be just as pleased if you hang them here.
We've been killing them for years.
What has it brought us? Peace?
Hang me, and my sons will not rest... while a single Christian remains alive in Vivar.
What other way is there to treat the Moors?
Hang them now!
Do you want these people to live in fear the rest of their lives?
Antonio, do you want to see your church burned too?
Your villages destroyed?
Then kill them.
Don Diego, tell your son that it is treason... to refuse to turn over prisoners to an officer of the King.
Rodrigo knows what he must do.
Do you solemnly pledge never again to attack King Ferdinand's country?
I do.
Among our people, we have a word for a warrior... with the vision to be just and the courage to be merciful.
We call such a man, "El Cid."
I, Moutamin, Emir of Saragossa... pledge eternal friendship to the Cid of Vivar... and allegiance to his sovereign lord,
King Ferdinand of Castile.
May Allah strike the eyes from my head... and the flesh from my bones if I break this pledge.
In the name of Allah.
In the name of Allah.
In the name of Ferdinand...
King of Castile,
Leon and Asturias...
I charge you with treason.
Within seven days, you will appear before the King at Burgos... to answer these charges.
You did take the shortest road, my son.
Not to your bride, but to your destiny.
God sent you to us, my son.
God has sent you.
Rodrigo!
But I did hear a sound.
He should have been here by now.
Why is he so late?
He is not late, my lady.
He was to be here at sundown.
It's barely noon.
Yes.
You don't really understand how love keeps time.
Later means sooner; sundown means noon.
Still, a man on a horse can move only so fast... no matter how much the man is in love.
Yes, my lady.
All night long I kept thinking:
"Oh, the Moors have ambushed him!
"Oh, yes, he's been attacked by a madman.
Oh, he's fallen ill."
They say all women in love... are tormented that way.
Because they don't dare believe that such happiness... can really be theirs.
Help me, please.
The gown is... very beautiful.
Your Highness is... very gracious.
It is not often we are so honored.
No. It is not an ordinary day.
Then you have not heard?
There has been news.
News of... of Rodrigo, Your Highness?
Of Rodrigo.
The gown is so beautiful.
Your Highness.
Your Highness.
Can you tell me what has happened to Rodrigo?
Yes, I can tell you.
- You knew that Rodrigo was on his way here?
- Yes.
That there was a battle?
You knew that there was a battle with the Moors?
Chimene.
My father, tell me.
- Rodrigo's been hurt.
- No, Rodrigo's alive and well.
You love him so much.
Two names.
My father... and Rodrigo.
Chimene... you are my only child.
I have no wife.
You alone can carry my blood.
I should have had a son.
But Rodrigo will be your son.
No.
You're young.
You can learn to love again.
Could I learn to love another father?
It is not the same.
There are others.
Chimene!
Chimene!
Don Garcia Ordonez, tell me what has happened.
You have always been a good friend.
I would be more to you, Chimene... if you would let me.
You know that can never be.
It can now.
- Why now?
- Could you love a traitor, Chimene?
Since I love Rodrigo, the question can never have meaning.
It has meaning now.
Rodrigo is a traitor.
I do not believe you.
- There were others who were there.
- I do not believe them.
I am the one who brought the charges against him.
He is to be tried for treason against the King.
You would do anything to hurt Rodrigo.
No. I would do anything to win you.
Chimene!
What if these charges are true?
- They are not true.
- But there are many who saw it.
They did not know what they saw!
You will see for yourself, Chimene.
His Majesty, Don Ferdinand... the King, our Lord!
King of Castile, Leon and Asturias.
And the Infantes, Prince Sancho...
Prince Alfonso... and the Princess Dona Urraca.
You have been gathered here at this court... to give your solemn advice in a matter of great import to the Crown.
Garcia Ordonez has invoked the charge of treason... against Rodrigo of Vivar.
He cannot bring such charges against my son!
I repeat the charge! It is treason!
He's the man who's fighting Moors!
It is treason to the King!
You shouldn't have come.
Then I'll go.
No. Another moment.
Oh, forever.
Besides, there is no danger.
No danger?
Listen to them.
It doesn't matter.
Because I know you're not guilty.
- You don't even know what I've done.
- No.
But I know it was not treason.
What did you do?
I let a man live.
No. Five men.
But how can they call it treason?
Death to the Moors!
Who are these five men?
Emirs.
Moors? You let Moors live? Why?
I'm not sure it was right.
I don't know.
I think it was...
It happened strangely.
I was on my way to you.
I can't even remember where I was.
There must have been roads... trees and people.
All I remember is your face.
There was a battle.
I fought too.
My heart wasn't in my sword.
I kept seeing your face.
Suddenly, I thought,
"Why are we killing each other?"
True, they're Moors, we're Christians...
Chimene... do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Yes, but... there always have been wars between us.
I know.
Always.
You don't think, then... we could live in peace?
Silence!
Will you keep quiet, the both of you!
This is not a charge
I would bring lightly against any man... especially a man who in a short time was to be my son.
But a man who frees the enemies of the King... son or no son...
I must call such a man "traitor."
Sire, he slurs the honor of our family.
This cannot be.
I, too, was once the King's champion.
That was many years ago, Don Diego.
Perhaps it will be better to leave the matter in our hands.
No, Sire. There were things said here which cannot be forgotten... even in this royal assembly.
Count Gormaz of Oviedo... when you call my son a traitor...
I say you lie.
I am the King's champion.
I would not want to shame my sword with an old man's blood.
Yet no man can call me a liar.
Liar!
I don't really understand, Rodrigo.
I only know if it grew out of our love... it must be right.
What do you want?
You shamed my father.
I want his name back.
But not the way you left it.
I want it clean so he can once more wear it proudly.
I cannot apologize.
It is not that I do not want to.
I do not know how to.
People will only esteem you the more for it.
Everyone will understand.
I have told you no.
Go home, Rodrigo.
I ask nothing for myself.
I humble myself before you.
Have pity on a proud old man.
I have no pity for those who have outlived the usefulness of their lives.
Count.
I beg you.
See? Two words are all I ask.
Can you not say, "Forgive me"?
I cannot.
I will not.
Now go.
Don't make me stain my life... and Chimene's with your blood.
Go home, Rodrigo.
No one will think the less of you for not having stood up against the King's own champion.
Count Gormaz!
I will ask you... only this last time.
I see that courage and honor are not dead in Castile.
And now I remember why I once thought you were worthy of my Chimene.
Go home, Rodrigo.
What glory is there for the King's champion in killing someone like you?
Can a man live... without honor?
No.
Now, Count, now I am satisfied.
Chimene!
Chimene!
Chimene.
Father!
- Chimene.
- Oh, Father!
Avenge me... as my son would.
Don't let me die... unavenged.
Unavenged.
Oh, Father.
I didn't seek your father's life, Chimene.
No, but you knew he could only answer the way he did... and you were prepared to kill him.
You bought your honor with my sorrow.
There was no other way for me.
The man you chose to love could do only what I did.
Why did you come, Rodrigo?
Did you think the woman you chose to love could do less than you?
I tried not to come.
I tried.
I told my love it had no right to live.
But my love won't die.
- Kill it!
- You kill it!
Tell me you don't love me.
I cannot.
Not yet.
But I will make myself worthy of you, Rodrigo.
I will learn to hate you.
Dona Chimene, daughter of the late Count Gormaz of Oviedo... the King's lamented champion.
Dona Chimene, never was there a moment when we needed your father more.
His death is a great loss to us.
And never did I regret more deeply... that I am his daughter and not his son.
I will not stand on ceremony, Ferdinand.
Three times I have written you on the matter of the city of Calahorra... and have received no answer.
The city of Calahorra belongs to Aragon, and I've come to claim it.
Calahorra has always been a part of Castile.
His Majesty, King Ferdinand, of Castile, Leon and Asturias... denies these claims.
Ramiro, King of Aragon by the grace of God... does this day challenge Ferdinand,
King of Castile, Leon and Asturias... to meet him in battle on the plains of Calahorra... with all the forces he can command.
To the victor in this battle and to his heirs... the city of Calahorra shall belong forever!
No!
All Spain is threatened by the Moors.
What could give greater comfort to the enemy... than to see two Christian kings and their
Christian armies tear each other to bits.
Why not then let the fate of Calahorra be determined... by the outcome of a single combat... between your champion and mine?
We know why you have chosen this moment to press your claim.
Our champion is dead.
The gauntlet lies there.
Let one man come forward now, or give up Calahorra.
Lord King!
Let me take up this gauntlet, Sire.
Why should we entrust the fate of a city... to your inexperienced hands?
It was I who killed your champion, Sire.
What man has a better claim to his place?
Don Martin has killed
27 men in single combat.
You know that?
Yes.
Yes, Sire, I know that.
Why, then, would you risk your life in this way?
I stand accused of treason, Sire.
And of other things.
I've not been permitted to answer these charges. You've not judged me.
Let me now offer myself before the highest judge.
If I'm guilty...
God will direct Don Martin's lance to my heart.
If I'm innocent, let him be my shield.
- He's never fought before.
- He is strong, Father.
A city, a whole city is at stake.
- He defeated our champion.
- How do we know it wasn't from behind and in the dark?
- There were no witnesses.
- That is not Rodrigo's way.
Let him fight, Father.
He has much to fight for.
Rodrigo of Vivar, take up the gauntlet.
And may God give you strength.
May God give me strength.
Why have you come to this place at this hour?
We have come to do battle for the city of Calahorra!
Will you fight to the death, giving no quarter and receiving none?
- We will.
- We will.
Go, then, and fight for Calahorra.
Don Martin.
Don Martin.
You have always been my father's enemy.
Will you be his avenger?
Will you wear my colors?
My lady, who would not be proud to wear your colors?
I promise you that he who has offended you shall die.
Until your triumph, my color will be black.
Rodrigo, the champion of Castile cannot go into combat... without a lady's colors.
My lady.
Almighty God, now the hour of my ordeal has come.
Judge me and let all men know my guilt or innocence.
Do you think Don Martin will kill Rodrigo?
I hope he does, Your Highness.
I'm sure you will understand why I do not join you in that hope.
After all, we would lose a city.
He's held the first charge!
Rodrigo's held!
Kill him!
To whom does Calahorra belong?
Calahorra belongs to Ferdinand... and to Castile.
God saw fit to give me strength, Sire.
Never have I seen a man fight with greater courage.
Our Lord was surely with you.
Who can now deny that the charges brought against you were false?
We are deeply in your debt, Rodrigo.
You will be my champion.
Your colors are no longer black.
Until my father is avenged... my colors will be deepest black.
Someone will avenge me.
Someone will yet come forward.
No. Believe me, Chimene.
Not one knight in all Castile will risk his life against Rodrigo.
He has become too dangerous.
Then why have you come to me,
Don Garcia?
This is not just a momentary anger?
You really want Rodrigo's death?
- You would fight Rodrigo?
- Not fight. Kill him.
I could fight him.
It's not a question of courage.
Before I first saw you,
I was ready to throw my life away... but... not now, Chimene.
To kill him?
How?
I want your love, Chimene.
More than I want honor, glory, wealth.
You understand a love like that.
Yes. Yes, I do.
Then I will kill him.
Oh, Father.
Why did you leave me such a burden?
Rodrigo of Vivar, you are hereby our own champion... and the first Knight of the Realm.
With this sword, may you vanquish all our enemies.
My lieges... for the first time in generations... our Moorish vassals have refused to pay us tribute.
They have been stirred into unrest by the Moors of Africa.
An expedition, therefore, must be sent to collect that tribute.
This expedition will be your first task.
May I prove worthy, Sire.
Our son, Sancho, will go with you.
May I too prove worthy, Father.
Sire, this will be the first expedition of our Prince.
Could I, too, accompany him?
You have our permission,
Count Ordonez.
Spare our son Sancho no hardship or danger... but teach him also that peace, not war, is the real task of a king.
Lord King, by ancient custom... when a lord deprives a lady of her support... he is himself required to give her shelter.
I killed that lady's father.
Therefore, if, by God's will...
I return alive from this mission... will you give me Dona Chimene of Gormaz as my lawful wife... to provide for and protect as her father would have done?
Yes, Rodrigo.
Let there be an end to this hatred.
The marriage will take place on your return.
Dona Chimene will hold herself in readiness.
In nomine Patrius et Filius et Spiritu Sancti, amen.
This is the man you hoped
Don Martin would kill.
This is the man whose death you sought.
Yes, Your Highness?
Would you then still accept this marriage?
If it is the King's order,
I must obey.
My Cid, beware!
Stop him!
My Lord Moutamin.
My Lord Cid.
You came in good time this day.
Praise be to Allah.
You were betrayed by one of your own, my Lord Cid.
Betrayed by a Christian, saved by a Moor.
You've earned the enmity of your people.
It was no more than my Cid did for me.
If ever you have need of me.
If ever you have need of me.
Ordonez.
Before I die, I want you to know that the woman you love... offered herself to me if I would kill you.
Kill him!
Kill him!
He betrayed us!
No. Let him go.
- They will say I was too soft.
- You will soon be a king!
You must learn to think like one.
Any man can kill.
Only a king can give life.
I want no more blood on my marriage.
Volo.
Why doesn't she speak?
Volo.
Will my lady take a little wine?
It is a very good wine, especially brought from Vivar.
I thank you, Fanez. No.
All night long you've been telling my lady how good everything is...
- because it comes from Vivar.
- Well, it is good.
You will see for yourself, my lady, when you come to Vivar.
It is such... such a happy place.
- Is it, Fanez?
- Oh, yes, my lady.
It's impossible to be there without... feeling it.
I... I think my lord and lady must be tired.
Yes!
Good night, my lord, my lady.
Good night, and may this night be the most, uh...
I mean, may you have, uh...
Good night, my lord and lady.
Good night.
Since I've taken the vows of wife... and since there must be nothing hidden between man and wife... there is something
I wish to tell you.
Sometimes it's best to leave a little something hidden... even between man and wife.
They say each unspoken thought... becomes a small ghost.
We have room for a few small ghosts.
I knew Ordonez would betray you.
We planned your death... together.
Chimene, I knew you'd planned to kill me.
Ordonez told me.
I never hoped... our marriage would bring your love back quickly.
I did hope it would end your hate... and that... then somehow...
Chimene.
Do you know why
I married you, Rodrigo?
It was the only way left for me to avenge my father.
It is true that if you want me... it is your right as my husband to take me.
But you will never get a woman's love from me.
Perhaps we have... wounded each other too deeply.
Chimene.
Is it our Chimene?
Yes, Reverend Mother.
It's Chimene.
Why have you come back to us?
I've come to find peace, Mother.
After all that has happened to you... the peace you seek is not within these walls.
You were made for the world, Chimene.
One day you will want to go back to it.
But you may remain with us... until you feel you must leave.
Why do they not hail me king?
Because you are not the king.
The kingdom has been divided.
- Liar.
- Father proclaimed before he died that Castile is yours...
- but Asturias and Leon go to me!
- Liar!
- And to our sister Urraca the walled city of Calahorra.
- No! I am the eldest.
'Tis my birthright.
The kingdom will not be divided!
You can't stop it now.
I am King of Asturias and Leon.
- I won't let you stand in my way.
- I am the eldest son!
I'll have the Triple Crown or none at all!
Then let it be none at all.
It was you and Urraca against me.
Father was old.
She worked on him!
You're no better than we are, just because you're the firstborn.
You and our sister.
It was always you and our sister.
You... held her too close!
You covet her!
You lie!
Sancho, no!
He thought he could be king.
Accompany His Highness to his new kingdom... the dungeon of Zamora.
Will you give me your prisoner, or must I take him?
There are 13 of us and you are alone.
What you do is against God's law.
Were you 13 times 13
I would not be alone.
What kind of a man are you?
Come.
We'll go to your sister at Calahorra.
Open the gates of Valencia... in the name of Allah!
And the time came when Ben Yusuf rode to Valencia...
to secure the aid of the frightened
Moorish king Al Kadir.
He had to make certain that he could land his mighty armada...
on the shores of Spain.
Clear out, all of you!
My lord Ben Yusuf, what an honor.
What an honor.
Allah be praised.
Our moment has come.
King Ferdinand has died... and the two young kings have quarreled.
Allah, in his wisdom, has willed it so.
And now Allah will ordain it so that one Christian brother... will kill another Christian brother.
How will this happen?
He... will do the killing.
The word will spread that brother has killed brother.
There will be confusion, revolution.
The kingdom will be torn in two... and then, when they are most weak,
I will bring my legions from Africa.
A master strategy.
When I land, they may attack you here at Valencia.
If they do, you will hold Valencia.
Do you understand me?
Yes, my lord, I understand.
I will leave my guards with you to make certain you understand.
Don't let him take me, Urraca.
Go.
Go.
Urraca!
Urraca!
Urraca!
Urraca!
You have given refuge to my brother!
I demand you release him at once!
This is my city!
You do not demand!
Release the prisoner at once or my army will attack!
Alfonso stays here... with me!
I give you until dawn to decide.
My lady.
What would it be worth to you... if Sancho were kept from your gates?
Who is there who could do such a thing?
I could.
Only... Only I would ask a great deal.
Thank heaven you answered our call.
Why did you send it, sir?
Unless I surrender to Sancho...
- he threatens to lay siege to us by morning.
Help us, Rodrigo.
When brother fights against brother... what can any man do?
If you joined us, many knights would come.
I swore allegiance to Sancho.
And to Alfonso.
And to me!
I can only help one brother by breaking faith with the other.
- I can help no one.
- But Sancho would kill Alfonso.
Whatever happens... must happen without me.
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
What do you want here, Dolfos?
I have words for your ears only, my King.
Well?
There is a way Calahorra could be taken without a blow.
I will help you.
Why should you do this for me?
I will not stand by and see our land torn by civil war.
Tell me.
I know where there is an unguarded gate.
I will take you there.
With a few men, you...
Even though my father trusted you, Dolfos... one false move...
But I am unarmed, Sire.
Show me this gate.
From here it will be better to go on foot.
I see no gate.
There.
Around the corner.
Open!
Open the gate!
Open the gate!
Open the...
Confess me.
Confess me.
Confess me!
Sancho.
- Rodrigo.
- My poor Sancho.
I was almost a king.
Wasn't I?
You are a king, my lord.
I have not come here as a queen.
Forgive me, Your Highness.
You still love Rodrigo.
And I know Rodrigo still loves you.
You have made a long and hard journey to come here.
Rodrigo must be stopped!
We will not permit this,
Alfonso and I!
Rodrigo will listen to you.
What is it I must tell Rodrigo,
Your Highness?
He has threatened to force
Alfonso to swear publicly... that he is innocent of our brother Sancho's death.
Is he not innocent of your brother's death?
You must tell him not to do this.
He must not. We will not permit it!
We will stop him!
You... had better speak to him.
Do you understand me, Chimene?
I understand, Your Highness.
No one can ask a king to swear.
No one!
Before God and this assembly...
I do freely forgive those who have warred against me.
I promise to defend them and to show them favor... even as I defend and show favor to those that were ever loyal to me.
This, my written oath...
I entrust to this Holy Church.
Castilians...
God has called upon me to become your king.
I now call upon you to kneel in sign of fealty.
Rodrigo of Vivar... called the Cid... why do you alone refuse me fealty?
Sire... all those you see here... though none dares say so... harbor the suspicion that you may have counseled your own brother's death.
Unless you can prove your innocence... you will have no loyal subjects.
Your kingdom will be torn by doubt.
Thus I cannot give you fealty... nor own you as my liege.
What will satisfy you of my innocence?
Your oath upon the holy book.
You would ask me to swear?
Sire, I do ask it.
Very well.
Will you swear that you had no part... in the ordering of King Sancho's death?
I so swear.
Do you swear that you had no part by way of counsel... in King Sancho's death?
I so swear.
Do you swear that you had no part by way of design... in King Sancho's death?
I swear it!
If you are forsworn... may you die such a death as your brother did... struck from behind by the hand of a traitor.
Say amen.
You press me too far, Rodrigo.
Say amen.
Amen.
"By edict of our most illustrious
Sovereign Alfonso...
"King of Castile,
Leon and Asturias...
"be it known that Rodrigo of Vivar...
"has outraged the Royal Personage and is hereby exiled for life.
"He has been accorded nine days from this day...
"in which to depart from the realm, alone and without men at arms.
"All his property, his goods, his lands and his privileges...
"are hereby forfeit to the Crown.
"All vessels of the King...
"are forbidden to provide him with food, lodging or any means of sustenance...
"or to speak with him.
Let no man give him aid."
I thirst.
I thirst.
I thirst.
Lord Knight, I thirst.
There is no spring nearby from which a leper is allowed to drink.
I'm thirsty.
Here.
It's for you.
For you.
- Thank you, my Cid.
- How do you know my name?
There is only one man in Spain who could humble a king...
and would give a leper to drink from his own pouch.
Who are you?
I am called Lazarus.
May helping hands be extended to you... everywhere you go, my Cid.
Can you forgive me, Rodrigo?
Chimene.
Would you take me with you?
But... now I... have nowhere to take you.
If we are together... it will not be nowhere.
I love you, Rodrigo.
I love you.
You know what you risk... if you come with me, my love?
Since my love is not a man like other men... my life will not be like other lives.
It's only now... only now that I know... how hard the road would've been without you.
Are you the one they call the Cid?
Yes.
Then you must be the beautiful Chimene.
Do you not hate him anymore?
No, I do not.
My father says they'll cut our hands off if we help you.
My father says they have eyes everywhere.
But my father said if you walk very slowly it will soon be dark... and no one will be able to see you if you go into our barn.
I suppose we must leave soon... before it gets too light.
No, one more moment... to remember all of this.
Have you ever slept in a more beautiful bedchamber?
Never.
- Have you ever eaten better food?
- No.
Nor drunk better wine, nor...
I love you.
Dona Chimene, my wife.
I'm so glad, Rodrigo.
So glad.
Must we go?
Of what are you glad?
That you are no longer the King's champion... that you no longer have your knights and your armies... and that you have only me.
We will find some hidden place where you are not known.
Yes, a place like this.
And we will make our lives there.
If all men knew that banishment could be like this... we'd have a world of exiles.
Come.
We'll look for your hidden place... before the others find it.
We'll have a new life now.
Lord God... protect this woman I love... and who is now, finally, my wife.
El Cid!
I am in exile!
Without you, we are all in exile.
I can't take you with me!
You'd lose your homes, your families!
Every man here has already made the choice.
We want you to lead us!
You have no right to ask him!
He has done enough!
- El Cid!
- El Cid!
But why him?
Why?
For Spain!
Spain!
Urraca!
I haven't slept all night.
Every time I close my eyes to sleep...
I dream the same dream over and over.
I'm fighting an enemy whose face I can never see.
I cut him down with my broadsword, he falls.
But when I look down... it isn't my enemy lying at my feet.
It's...
It's my own right arm.
It was only a dream.
It was nothing.
It was nothing.
- Our dream was short.
- I know.
There is no hidden place for a man like you.
There must be thousands who would gladly part.
Why you?
Why me?
Please, let me carry away an image of you smiling.
It would be a lie.
I will beseech God with my prayers.
I will tell Him He must bring you back to me.
I must tell God how much I need you.
Then we will see each other again.
Don Rodrigo.
We have not forgotten or forgiven the wrong you did our Royal person.
But when danger threatens, it is a king's duty... to put the welfare of his subjects above all else.
That is why we summoned you here.
Sire, I have all these years lived... in the hope Your Majesty would call me.
Especially now, since Ben Yusuf has landed on our shores.
Ben Yusuf has challenged us to meet him on the plains of Sagrajas.
Sire, you must not fight at Sagrajas.
- Valencia must first be...
- We have already accepted the challenge.
My liege, you must first take Valencia.
While the Moors hold Valencia...
Ben Yusuf can strike out from there, overrun all Spain.
Your Majesty must not let this happen.
Look, I have brought friends to help you in this fight.
How dare they not kneel to us?
Sire.
These are kings.
They come here as allies.
- We need no such allies.
- We are a Christian kingdom!
We treat only with Christians.
They're ready to fight at your side for Valencia.
They fear Ben Yusuf as we do.
They are your friends.
We do not consider them friends.
Sire!
You risk having no Spain at all!
Don Rodrigo, you will join us at Sagrajas... and we shall annul your banishment and return your lands.
But if you are not at Sagrajas... we shall consider you and yours our enemies!
Don Rodrigo.
I know why you have come.
Your twin daughters are playing in the garden here.
This is your father.
You're Elvira?
Then you must be Sol.
You're Elvira.
You're exactly alike.
I'm tired.
Tired of exile.
Now I can take you home to Vivar... with honors.
I might be wrong to defy the King.
He commanded me to meet him at Sagrajas.
I could be wrong.
If you did not have us, Rodrigo... would you even wonder?
I used to see so many of your hidden places... where I could've lived with you.
And no one would have known.
Have you also found a place... where we could hide from ourselves?
I can't leave you... leave them here unprotected.
But if you do what must be done for all Spain... that will be our best protection.
Our Moorish silks suit well your Christian armor.
You'll make a Moslem of me yet, my lord.
How can anyone say this is wrong?
They will say so, on both sides.
We have so much to give to each other and to Spain.
If we are not destroyed first.
Once we take Valencia, then let Ben Yusuf try.
Valencia is surrounded.
No one here can leave the city or enter it.
Then our weapon is starvation.
May Allah make the siege a short one.
May God help our King Alfonso at Sagrajas.
We could have beaten Ben Yusuf!
With a few more men we could have won!
A handful of knights and victory would have been ours.
Dona Chimene, did you think we would permit your husband to go unpunished?
Would you punish the man who is now Spain's only hope?
What if we were to place Dona Chimene and her children in our deepest dungeons?
Might not the Cid then deliver himself into our hands?
Sire, this is a sanctuary.
There are no sanctuaries for the enemies of Christ!
If you crush him, who then would stand against the invaders of Spain?
It was his fault! If he had come, we would have won.
Sire?
It was not for lack of courage that we lost.
You shall see.
You saw!
I made no sound!
It was not through lack of courage that we lost!
It takes more than courage to make a king.
Tell me his exact words!
The King said he would not release
Chimene and the children.
What does the King expect I'd do?
That I would let my wife and children die in his dungeons?
No! He hopes you will march on Burgos to rescue her.
Burgos! Well, then, shall we disappoint our King?
What do we wait here for?
To Burgos!
My Lord Cid, wait!
My lord, the city is ready to fall.
More and more people are coming over to our side.
After all these months, we cannot leave!
Don't speak to me of Valencia, my Lord Moutamin.
Not now!
Am I not a man, too, like you?
May I not sometimes think of my wife? My children?
Well, then, what must I do?
What must I do?
Everything was taken from you.
How did you bribe the jailer to bring me your message?
With two words: The Cid.
Even all these months in the dungeon... have not marred your beauty.
There are terrible rumors.
They are not rumors.
The Cid has sent an ultimatum to the King.
Unless you and the children are released at once... your husband will march against us here.
Abandon Valencia?
Leave all Spain unprotected?
Yes, Chimene, for you.
Why not?
Help me and the children to escape.
Come with us.
Join Rodrigo.
If I thought it would stop him from coming here...
I would kill myself... and the children.
Then your love is as desperate as mine.
Rodrigo, let me fight at your side.
We have need of such men.
Count Ordonez, we must attack tonight.
Soldiers!
Citizens of Valencia!
We have starved you!
Now you are weak!
But we do not wish to attack you!
We are not your enemies!
Ben Yusuf is your enemy.
He will bring you death and destruction!
People of Valencia... rid yourselves of your leaders!
Join with us!
We bring you peace!
Soldiers and citizens!
We bring you freedom!
We bring you life!
We bring you... bread!
We bring you bread! Bread!
Bread! Bread!
Bread! Bread!
My lord!
El Cid is throwing them food!
Your starving soldiers have deserted the walls and joined the people!
Kill them!
Call out the Black Guard.
Stop them!
Run them down! Kill them!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
King! King! King!
The city is yours! Take the crown.
Proclaim yourself king!
All our battles we have fought for you.
We want you to rule us.
My Lord Cid!
We have given up everything for you.
We implore you to take the crown.
I take Valencia... in the name of my Sovereign Lord Alfonso...
King of Castile,
Leon and Asturias... of Sagunto and Almenara... of Castrejon and Alcantara...
King of Christians and Moors.
Valencia for Alfonso... by the grace of God, King of Spain!
King! King! King!
What a noble subject.
If he had only a noble king.
King! King! King!
The crown of Valencia!
The crown of Valencia?
The Cid sends this to me?
What are his conditions?
There are no conditions.
But Chimene... He knew about the dungeon, his children.
He knew.
And yet he sends me the crown.
What kind of man is this?
He wants something.
What is it he wants?
My lord, the Cid has asked for nothing.
But I ask! My lord, the Cid needs your help... to defend Valencia against Ben Yusuf.
No!
Tell your lord, the Cid, that we seek neither his favor nor his help.
Nor can he expect anything from us.
Now go.
Who has done more for you and Spain?
Go!
Look. Now you are also
King of Valencia.
I am king of nothing.
No king at all!
- I will make myself a king!
- Alfonso.
- I will!
- Alfonso!
All men must die.
Why not for a good cause?
What cause of yours could be worth such torture?
The Cid.
The Cid? He is a man like other men.
He will die.
I will kill him.
He'll never die. Never.
You dare think of him as we think of our Prophet?
We do!
Then this will be more than a battle.
It will be our God... against yours!
Where's Ordonez?
I sent him to see if
Ben Yusuf was on the march.
- Hasn't he returned?
- Not yet, my Cid.
Ben Yusuf's armada.
We should attack at dawn before they can all land.
We'll drive a wedge along the shore... and keep his forces split.
Come.
I know, I know.
This is always the hardest time.
When the enemy has no face.
You have been through this a hundred times.
I need to know.
Where do you find your courage?
I wish I knew.
Each warrior each time must find it for himself.
Come.
This is the battle we've waited for so long.
The last battle.
When we've won it, we'll have peace.
Open the gates.
For God, Alfonso and for Spain!
For God, Alfonso and Spain!
The Cid is wounded.
He goes back to Valencia.
The Cid is wounded.
The Cid is wounded.
The Cid is wounded.
The Cid...
No, Fanez.
We attack again tomorrow.
You will need time to recover your strength.
Must be tomorrow.
The enemy will only grow stronger... while we grow weaker.
- But, my lord!
- Tomorrow, Fanez.
Make the preparations.
Go. Cover their retreat. Go!
Close the gates!
Close the gates!
There will be a great loss of blood... but the arrow must be withdrawn immediately.
Will he live?
If the arrow is drawn, he has a chance.
If not, he will be dead within a few days.
Chimene.
I must lead the attack tomorrow.
If the arrow is not withdrawn... it is certain you will die.
Not before tomorrow.
- That's all I need.
- But it's not all I need.
What will there be for you if this battle is lost?
Someone else will lead them.
They have made me their heart.
But their heart is wounded.
It needs to rest.
We could take you to Vivar.
We could cure you.
My love would not let you die.
We have not spent much time together.
Yet it seems to me...
I will not let you.
You will live.
Yet it seems to me that those who have spent a lifetime together... have not had more than we.
I want more!
I want forever!
Oh, the children.
The children.
Chimene... you can't save my life.
You must help me give it up.
Now.
Lord Moutamin.
It is the wish of my husband... that the arrow shall not be removed.
Allah be praised!
The Cid is dead! The Cid is dead!
Let it be known everywhere the Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead! The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead! The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
The Cid is dead!
They dare not come out and fight!
Let it be known everywhere the Cid is dead!
I tell you!
The Cid is alive!
He is well!
I have seen him!
He will fight tomorrow!
He will be with us, leading the attack.
I promise! You must...
You must believe me!
The Cid is alive!
- Fanez?
- Yes, my lord.
What are they saying?
All is well, my lord.
Very well.
The people are hopeful.
The army is eager to fight.
You always were a bad liar, Fanez.
Now tell me the truth.
I could not convince them... that you are alive.
El Cid! El Cid!
Cid! Cid!
Cid! Cid!
Soldiers!
People of Valencia!
You must not be frightened... by the sound of a few drums.
In a few hours, they will be silenced forever!
I promise you!
Tomorrow morning...
I will ride with you!
Cid! Cid!
Cid! Cid!
Cid! Cid! Cid!
Cid! Cid! Cid!
- Chimene.
- I am here, Rodrigo. I am here.
Listen to me.
Even if my strength fails me...
- I must lead the attack tomorrow.
- Yes.
I must!
You understand?
I must.
Alive or dead...
I must be on my horse at the head of my soldiers.
You promise... you will do whatever needs to be done?
Yes.
- Promise me.
- I promise, Rodrigo.
I promise.
I promise.
Yes.
I promise.
I promise.
Open the gates!
It's the King!
My lord, the King!
Forgive me, my Cid.
- Forgive me!
- No!
My King kneels to no man!
To no man!
It's not easy for a man to conquer himself.
You have done that.
If only I could live to see Spain at peace.
You will.
You will!
No one can stand against us now.
We'll drive Ben Yusuf back into the sea!
I have not failed.
Spain... has a king.
Tomorrow we will fight side by side.
My King and I.
We will ride out together.
Together.
No!
I will be at your side.
Chimene!
Ah, Chimene.
Chimene.
I promise.
I have not forgotten.
I want you and my children... to remember me riding with my King.
Tomorrow.
For God, the Cid and Spain!
For God, the Cid and Spain!
For God, the Cid and Spain!
And thus the Cid rode out of the gates of history into legend.
Back! Back!
Go back!
Go back!
Heavenly Father, open Your arms to receive the soul... of one who lived and died the purest knight of all.
This man has been brought to me as one who misleads the people.
He is accused of sedition and blasphemy, for which he should suffer death.
My Lord Governor!
My Lord Governor...
...there is a custom in Jerusalem, that at this season of the feast...
...one condemned man should be released.
I remember the custom.
Who shall it be?
This man who many of you call their king?
Or shall it be Barabbas?
Release Barabbas!
- Release Jesus of Nazareth!
- No, not Barabbas!
- Barabbas!
- Release Barabbas! Crucify the Nazarene!
They're mad, Lord Governor.
Barabbas is a rebel.
A robber, an assassin.
Release Barabbas!
Take the Nazarene, scourge him and bring him here again...
...and he shall be crucified.
All right, that's enough.
Take him out.
Open up.
Come on.
One man to be set free.
Set free?
You ought to know the custom of the season.
The Governor offered them either the prophet or you.
He listened to the voices and they chose you.
I make no comment.
Come on. Get on the move.
All right.
Give us a hair of your beard.
It ought to be lucky, considering how things have gone for you.
I'm not used to the light. It plays tricks.
If I was you, I shouldn't loiter.
I'd want to see the back of this place before they change their minds.
Get on your way, will you?
- Who do you think you're shoving?
- Get going.
All right. I'm going.
Move on.
- There he is. Release the Nazarene!
- Get out of the way.
What are you standing for, like an idiot?
What are you all hanging around for?
Here's a fine sight.
Six weeks and nobody's moved.
What's happened then?
How did you get out?
This is a surprise, let me tell you.
Is that my duck? It's him!
- Sara!
- There's the black knave himself...
...come back to his own.
Cheating his death again, like a good boy.
The clever one. How did you do it?
I was released to celebrate the holiday as a surprise for you.
Here's a day to celebrate in all my god.
Come on and tell us the whole story.
You've not heard?
I'm the choice of the people.
"Give us Barabbas," they said.
Give me some food.
Food for Barabbas. Food for a hungry man.
How does it feel?
How did you feel when they told you?
The choice of the people, eh?
Old Sara here dropping tears so fast all the slopping wine got watered.
- Where did you get your luck?
- What witch gave you that?
Pass him across to me!
- Touch him for luck. That's it.
- I'm not taking chances.
Get away.
Where's Rachel?
Shut away mourning for me?
Fetch her down here.
She's no good for you or anyone else.
- She's completely changed, I'm telling you.
- What's wrong with her? Bring her down.
She's no good to my old rascal now.
She thinks of nothing, day or night...
...except this prophet from Nazareth, who's on trial for blasphemy.
Ever since she heard him preach, she has gone off her life...
...like a sick child goes off its food.
Come on, you old empty belly.
There's no food inside you worth vomiting.
Sit down and eat.
Barabbas, that girl's no good for you.
Take my word for it.
As morbid as a crow in a chimney.
Bewitched by a prophet.
A waste of a handsome girl.
And she's gone to his trial looking like a widow already.
She knows what happened to her prophet.
That's the end of him.
- Condemned, was he?
- That's just it.
They had the choice between him and me, and they chose me. How do you like that?
The idol of the city.
Tell you what.
You're as good as a king, Barabbas.
They call the prophet King of the Jews, but they chose you.
Show your respects to King Barabbas.
- Let's have a crowning of him.
- Yes!
- The wicked old King of Judea.
- What are you doing?
- Come on, give him his robes.
- You be nice to your King Barabbas.
More wives than Solomon and his subjects as ripe as old pumpkins.
Here's your sceptre. Take it.
Set him on his throne.
- What's that?
- That's the sceptre.
Sit down on your throne.
Kneel down, all you miserable scum of the earth, and acknowledge.
Kneel down, you scum of the earth.
Hail! Hail!
I'll make laws for you that will tax your constitutions.
I crown you, King Barabbas.
Here she is, Barabbas, if you want her.
Look here, Rachel, look who's been asking for you.
The old rascal back from the dead.
So, here she is.
What's the matter with me?
Why don't you look at me?
Barabbas, let me go.
Not until you've told me you're glad I'm alive.
- I wouldn't wish any man his death.
- What do you mean by that?
Don't make me speak to you.
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't make me speak to you.
That's a warm welcome.
I couldn't follow any further.
I daren't say what is still to come, but God forgive us all if he can.
What did I tell you?
She's no good to you now, Barabbas.
Come on.
I'm not here to be made a fool of.
What's the matter?
Remember how it used to be.
Barabbas, don't you see what's happening?
Don't you understand what set you free?
I just got out of prison.
I need to get the cramp out of my bones.
That's what's happened.
- I'm not the same. Nothing is the same.
- You'd better try and make it the same.
Barabbas, listen to me.
For pity's sake believe me.
He came from God, the man who's taking your place.
You think I should have been killed instead of him?
You think I ought to be dead?
Barabbas, hear what I say.
He came from God.
That's none of my worry.
God can look after his own.
- And you can look after me.
- No!
That girl up there was always coming back with strange ideas.
She's got her head full of them.
Well, it seems she's got something to think about now, anyway.
- I don't like the look of it.
- Look of what? What's the matter?
The sky. The light's gone out of it.
I've never known it dark like this in the middle of the day.
Get a light, for mercy's sake.
Something's wrong with my eyes.
I can't see.
Something's wrong.
Everything's black.
Black as death.
I knew there was something wrong when I saw that light.
Tell me. Am I going blind?
Am I going blind?
What's happening?
You know what has happened.
Even the light has left us, now that we've killed him.
Well, are you satisfied now?
He's dead.
Just the same as any other man.
- We've seen it. That's the end of it.
- He promised to come back.
We shall see that, too.
Only two days and he'll be in the world again.
Look at his friends.
You think they believe it?
I tell you, you're mad. That's the end of it.
Not tomorrow, but the morning after.
How many days have I been here?
How many days have I been here?
Can't you hear me?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter? Two days.
Two days.
Then today's the third day?
Two and one make three. What's so odd?
We'll see, then.
This is the morning of the third day.
Barabbas, where are you going?
Now you know it's true.
All I know is the tomb is empty.
- Who moved the stone?
- God moved it.
God himself? You saw him do it?
A power came from the sky.
It was when the sun was rising, at the beginning of the day.
- First there was the music of a horn.
- Horn?
Then in the air there was an angel.
The whole sky seemed to dismantle.
It was white, it was fire.
It was white fire.
He stretched out his arm.
It seemed as long as a spear.
The point of the spear went between the stone and the rock...
...and the stone rolled away.
If only you had been here sooner and seen what I saw.
My eyes are good.
They see nothing but real things.
You have to believe this, Barabbas.
The Master was a man of truth, and he said this would be so.
Did you see a prophet come out of the tomb?
My eyes were so dazzled.
I think I must have covered them.
But when I could see again...
...a man and a woman were together in the garden. Then the woman was alone.
And then she went quickly away.
And the man was the same man they buried in there?
He was like a shadow.
The morning light was behind him.
But I'm sure it was he.
Shadows, light, that's about the truth of it.
Here's the truth of it:
Why do you think he should lie about himself...
...when it meant he would be killed?
How do you know what he said?
The priests ought to know more than you do. And they call it blasphemy.
He said:
"Love one another."
"Love one another"?
And they crucified him for that?
Where are you going?
There are those who can tell you more.
There's a house in the street of the potters where they meet.
You may find them there.
Go and ask them.
It's a trick they're playing.
They took the body and hid it to go on with their story.
Or are you afraid?
Are you afraid of knowing what has happened?
Are you looking for someone?
You like to see it?
The clay making itself?
Some other day.
What's happened? I heard there was news.
The tomb's empty, the women said they saw him.
Creed can have strange visions.
Only it's true. Where's Peter?
Who could it be?
Don't open it.
We should get out of this city.
Wiser to go down to Galilee.
Can we hide from the future forever?
Let's see what is here.
What if they mean to destroy us all?
Leaving no one to tell the knowledge of the man.
Can the word turn to silence?
I'm not afraid of that.
Where is he?
- What have you done with him?
- What do you want with us?
- The truth. What happened?
- What right have you to be here?
You know what I mean.
What are you all afraid of?
What are we afraid of?
You want to know what we want to know.
- What is the truth of this morning?
- I know the truth.
You stole the body.
You think we might have hidden it here among us.
But something else has happened.
If you find him here, it will only be if he comes himself.
Through that gate, as you did just now.
Don't you believe it. I saw the body.
He was a dead man.
If you were sure of that, you wouldn't be here.
He's risen.
I trust in him and wait.
You're all mad.
What do you think you're doing, making that net?
There's no sea to fish in closer than Galilee.
It's what I'm used to doing, my hands go to it.
But the streets in the cities have to be the sea for me now.
He made a joke about it when he took us away from the boats.
He said that in the future our fish would be men.
It was a serious joke.
It meant he'd given us the word to draw men out of the dark sea...
...into the light.
And you call yourself a fisherman?
Do I have to tell you what happens to the fish?
They struggle about, gasp and die.
We struggle and gasp.
You said something good.
Poor fish.
I, too...
...must struggle and gasp.
And die.
And die in order to live.
That's where men have the advantage over fish.
They can die to the world, die to the dark sea...
...and begin to live again in the light.
That's what he promised, and what he promised has happened.
But what has happened...
...we still don't know.
He's come back to life.
- He'll lead us to the new kingdom.
- I'll believe it when he's before us.
When I can touch him and hear him.
You're always full of doubts without any cause.
No cause to doubt that a dead man can come back to life?
No cause.
I can take you now to talk with a man who was dead.
The Master brought him back to life.
Thomas knows him well.
Come, talk to him.
Let him tell you.
You needn't be afraid.
Lazarus? Will you come to us?
Here's someone wants to question you.
Come in.
I'll leave you with him.
You can ask him whatever you like.
They told me death is not...
Is not death.
They brought me here to see...
...because you could make me believe it.
Because you were dead, and were raised from the dead by the man.
I mean...
...the Master.
That is true.
I was dead.
And I know that he is Christ...
...the Son of God...
...who has power over life and death.
What's it like there?
You were there.
- Tell me what it's like.
- Like?
- Like?
- Yes, what is it...
...this thing you experienced?
What is it?
I have experienced nothing.
Only death.
And death is nothing.
Nothing?
No.
What should it be?
You want me to tell you about the realm of the dead?
I cannot.
How would you tell an unborn child what life is?
It exists.
But it isn't anything.
To those who've been there...
...nothing else is anything either.
No one has asked me this before.
They have listened how life came back to me and gone away praising.
Only you have asked about death.
And none the wiser.
We're two men who might be dead.
Sharing his body.
Life.
Love one another.
Listen, everybody! That's the word.
Love one another!
We can tell them about loving one another.
- Leave me alone. I want to sit.
- What do you want to do, sit and think?
It's no good thinking.
Come on, let's go and find a new life.
- Where are you going, Barabbas?
- To see what "brought back to life" means.
Love one another!
- Come on.
- My shoe.
Look.
- Hey! Get up! Come on!
- Leave it alone.
Stay alive.
It's all you have to do.
It's not my fault they let him get killed.
You can't hang it around my neck.
I've as much right to be alive as any of you.
You stinking fish.
You're afraid to look at me because I'm alive.
You, look at me. Look at me!
It may be today that the new world comes.
Today or tomorrow.
But it will come, you will see.
Every day you have promised us, it has never come.
- It will never come.
- It will come. I know it.
Please, Rachel, tell us again what it will be like.
You'd better mind what you say.
Don't you know what can happen to you if they hear you?
Anybody now caught spreading such stories...
...the Son of God, the Messiah and such, is to be judged an enemy of the State...
...and stoned until he's dead.
It will be as though the Earth has become like a star burned clean.
Everything evil swept away.
We shall look up and there will be angels coming down from the sky...
...and they will put food in front of us and perhaps new clothes to wear.
White, like their own.
Or some blue, like the colour of the sky.
Pain and sorrow will sink into the ground, and everything will be made new...
...because the Son of God has risen from the dead.
The world has become his kingdom.
There's no truth in any of it.
I know this woman.
She doesn't know the difference between what is real...
...and what she dreamed in her sleep.
Don't you listen to her.
She's raking up trouble.
Nothing but trouble.
Trouble for you...
...if you won't turn and listen to the sounds that have come.
He knows but is afraid to believe it.
Look at you, Barabbas.
How can you see or hear what's to come?
It will happen, whether you take part in it or not.
He's right. It's dangerous talk.
They'll pull down our homes, drive us out.
Better listen to this man.
- Let's hear what the prophet said.
- Don't leave. Where are you going?
To where the lepers are, to tell them to be ready for the freedom that's coming.
- She's going among the lepers!
- Stop her!
She's going to set the lepers free.
- Don't let her go among the lepers!
- Don't let her set the lepers free!
You have no right to go among the lepers!
Look out, it's a temple guard!
We don't want the lepers to be free!
A charge has been lodged against this woman.
- She must be questioned.
- We heard she preaches blasphemy.
Bring her to the temple and we will judge her.
- Take your dirty hands off her.
- Don't take her! She's done no wrong.
Don't take her away.
Rachel!
For blasphemy, and spreading blasphemy, this woman is condemned.
For stirring up evil matters among the people...
...for misleading their minds and denying the wisdom of authority.
For her sins, she has been condemned to death by stoning.
Let the man who accused her and was found just in his accusation...
...cast the first stone.
What must I do?
Take this stone.
Come on. Throw it at her.
Why should I throw?
- I've nothing against her.
- You accused her.
- The law gives you the first stone.
- It was you.
Or you'll find yourself there beside her.
Throw quickly. If you wait, I may be afraid.
You don't have to think of Barabbas any more. He's not coming back.
And if he did, we'd know what to do with him.
You're still afraid of him because he used to roar at you like a brass bull.
You can't stand up to him even when he's gone.
He's gone to the devil once and for all,
I can tell you.
He's lost his nerve.
He's creeping about the city like a shivering priest.
Why do you think he's not come back?
Because he's afraid to stir hand or foot.
- We don't know yet, he won't come back.
- Who cares if he does?
We got a man here who can hang him in his own guts.
He came out of that prison mad.
Acquitted but mad.
We'll soon see it then.
So, you remembered the way to get here.
Given you up this past week.
You'll find things altered.
What's over is over.
I remembered the way.
Bring them across.
God's curse on you! The money is sacred!
It belongs to the temple!
- The god of battle will destroy you!
- Blasphemy!
You hypocrites. I'll kill you both.
What are you doing?
Here's all the treasure we wanted.
Come away!
I'll kill you the way you had her killed.
It seemed to me at the time, Barabbas, when you were given your liberty before...
...it wasn't a fortunate exchange.
They were calling for death and disorder when they called your name.
This is what I thought and this is what has occurred.
They put the scourge back into the fist.
By that I mean you and your life.
And many men have suffered and died in consequence.
The other man, too.
They're dying because of that.
This is a local matter, which I hope will soon be adjusted.
The shock and fear of an unreasoning fanaticism will pass.
But the appetite to destroy...
...which, alas, the human being shares with the wild beast, is always with us.
And it has rigorously to be disciplined in the name of civilization...
...and according to the law.
- That's what you say.
But I tell you, whichever side of the law we're on, we're the same men.
You and your kind, and me and my kind.
How else have you lived except my way?
What we haven't got, we go out and take.
Let him speak.
How else have you lived except my way?
Whoever's against us or gets in our way, we get rid of.
My knife may have bitten a few throats, but what about your weapons?
They've split thousands upon thousands.
If I've taken a passing woman to myself...
...your armies have looted and raped across continents.
And have been called the glory of the earth for doing it.
You were born according to the law and raised according to the law.
I was born by a girl thrown out of a brothel...
...who gave birth and cursed me before she died.
But I tell you, we belong to the same herd.
Unfortunately for you, Barabbas, the law is indispensable.
The law is the pass and permit to life in this world.
You were without it.
However, the law here tells me...
...that a man released by the will of the people at a holy festival...
...cannot thereafter be given a capital punishment.
You can't kill me?
Easier on you if we could.
I sentence you to transportation for life, whatever that's worth...
...to the sulphur mines on the island of Sicily.
I can't...
...be killed.
He meant me to live.
Deliberately he did it.
No killing Barabbas.
No death for Barabbas.
He died in my place.
The death has been paid.
He's taken my death.
That's it. He's taken my death.
That light, that wasn't light.
The dark, that wasn't dark.
That wasn't dark, that was life.
- That was life.
- Take the man away.
You'll die and rot, but I'll live forever!
I've got my life and you can't take it!
You stinking fish!
I've got my life and you can't have it!
I've got my life!
- Well, which are you?
- I'm Scorpus.
That means nothing, idiot.
What's your number?
- That's better.
- Who's the god?
- The divine Emperor Tiberius.
You have the privilege of being his property.
Move.
Go on, move.
That's all. Move on. Next two.
Put your back to it.
Move. Get your feet on the ground.
What are they doing?
They're sending us down to the next level to make room for you.
That's how you know how long you've been here...
...by how deep you're down.
They break you in gradually to get used to the dark.
Wait.
You've gotten used to the dark.
Did it take long?
Long enough.
It's got into me.
Come here.
What do you see?
You're blind.
Sulphur burns.
Dig.
Here.
You've got a partner there that seems to know how to live forever.
Better learn from him.
How long has it been?
Who was emperor then?
Tiberius? That was long ago.
Almost in another world.
Here, I'm called Sahak.
That's mine.
Here.
Move!
You make this even a worse hell than it is.
You don't care how I got here...
...but I'll tell you.
The ship I was serving on took on a cargo of slaves.
Some of them got free.
Slipped over the side, during my watch.
So, the captain put the chains on me.
What about your world?
What's your name?
- I asked you what your name is.
- All right.
If it's going to keep you quiet.
Barabbas.
What are you saying?
Barabbas.
What's the town you came from?
Jerusalem.
Are you the man they acquitted?
What is that to you?
Chained to you, of all men on Earth.
That's what I like to see, devils and beasts going for each other's throats.
Here's a head of you to hate each other.
Now work, you crazy dogs.
Let's see you working.
Work!
Get out! Move!
You hate my name.
You hate the sound of it.
You weren't even in Jerusalem, but you hate my name.
That's right. We hate it.
What does it matter?
What does it matter to you?
- You know who was killed in your place?
- Still that?
So, why shouldn't we hate your name?
I thought what he said was to love one another.
I can't imagine...
...he expects a man to have a spirit...
...as strong and patient as a dray horse.
It was only something I was told.
If you think I got the best of it, you stay here for a generation or two.
We've got a special duty for you two.
This'll show you what happens to fighting mongrels. Come on.
Why isn't it all forgotten?
That's what I don't understand.
Who's been spreading things about?
Keeping that tale alive all these years?
What could kill it?
When you think it was God's will come to Earth to show what he is.
I can see the reality of that.
Which is why the name of the Master goes on growing in the world.
I began to meet it wherever I sailed:
Phoenicia, Cyprus, Greece.
Even at the Port of Rome.
I began to understand what it meant.
But...
...it's a tough demand, the will of God.
I'm a poor hand at it.
And look where I've got us now.
Even though I've got his sign scratched on the back of the Emperor's head.
It means I belong to him, not to the Emperor.
It's the sign he has put on us all, if we give way enough to see it.
Look at this.
There's the shape of the cross.
Keep your God to yourself.
Why did you come here and rake up old lies about killing God?
What's going on down there?
Move yourselves or I'll leave you to rot.
Pull!
You think what it's like to me.
You're the only man I've met who saw him.
You were there at the beginning, and you won't talk.
You won't tell me.
- What are you afraid of?
- Nothing I'm afraid of.
Then you can tell me.
You see the darkness that went over heaven and Earth when he died?
Suppose I did.
The man died in a dust storm, the same as anybody's death.
Suppose his tomb was empty.
Can't a dead man be taken away?
You want the truth? I'll give it to you.
That's all of your God you'll get out of me.
Here, what's the matter?
Come on, get up.
If they see you can't work they take you and you won't come back.
Hey! Away!
All right, wake up.
- Come on. Move out, all of you.
- Get on your feet. You've had your sleep.
- You two, get your feet on the ground.
- Get out of there. Come on. Move!
Root yourselves out! Move, I say!
Wake up.
All right, there's work to be done.
- You've had enough sleep now.
- Wake up.
Come on, you! You, over there.
Wake up, you hear me?
- Get on your feet, I say.
- One dead man here.
I said get on your feet, all of you.
Now come on. Up on your feet.
- You've got to look as if you can work.
- What's the matter with you?
You can't stand up? Can't work?
I can work.
Here, this one's no use.
- How many survivors?
- None, sir. There can't be any.
- It was like the end of the world to them.
- The end of the underworld.
- What did you say, sir?
- Nothing.
Survivors!
Over here. Survivors.
Get ready to receive survivors!
Away.
Pull!
When they've recovered, put them to work in the fields.
I can taste the salt in the air.
Every breath of wind is full of the sea.
I thought I could never love it better than I did. But, oh, glory!
After the darkness of the mines...
...I could go and drown in it like a man besotted.
Now, are you glad to live?
What? Like a damned ox?
Salt me down and I'd praise God even for this.
How many times were you swindled in those foreign ports?
You must've been the easiest game they ever got their hands on.
- Why is that?
- You'd fall for any trick.
One smile...
...and you trust the world that half kills you.
Yes, I trust it.
It has to be hard going...
...or else how will the strength come that God has wanted?
God should make himself plain or leave me alone.
Am I the one who lets himself be swindled, or you?
Every time he came near, you refused to believe it.
But it's never been out of your mind.
What other man's death could have troubled you so long?
Stop there. Pull over to the side.
Rock to be carried.
Here.
It's a poor scratching, but the true sign.
Now will you leave me in peace?
All right, we go on.
Wait.
Julia, there are the two men
I was telling you about.
Send for them, Rufio. I want to see them.
- Bring those men over here to us.
- Very good, sir.
Stop! These two.
Take them off the plough.
Two men so strangely come up from the underworld.
Twenty years in the mines, the old one.
Indestructible.
I heard so.
You've earned the air you breathe, you two, by sheer good fortune.
- What are your names?
- Sahak, sir.
- And yours?
- Barabbas.
What's your age?
What does it matter?
Indeed, what should it matter?
We understand you mean to live forever.
I must touch them for the luck that's in them.
My wife thinks your merit is contagious.
All right, we don't want to hold up the work.
Back now.
It's from the Emperor.
It seems the gods approve your superstition.
We're to call to Rome.
- To Rome? What does it mean?
- I'm to enter the Senate.
- We're to rise in the world.
- Rufio. Rome!
It's true. They are charmed.
We must always take them with us.
A good thing I touched them.
I see, their success, not mine.
Nothing but amiable days from now on, and knowing everybody instead of nobody.
- When shall we go?
- Ride with us. I'll give you the answer.
How wretched to arrive when all have gone to the mountains...
Look over there.
Well, here we have to leave your luck to learn its business.
What do you mean?
Why do we come here?
They cannot fight yet.
They must first learn the skill.
And so they will.
But here we have to deliver them over.
Let's hope they won't disgrace us.
When a charmed life turns professional, we can expect great things.
Flacus, the Commander.
You honour Rome and us.
Our happiness is all here, Commander.
Unsurpassable. The Emperor has given him his freedom three times.
There's the third staff of liberty in his hand.
Always he prefers to come back.
He knows his empire and has the sense to keep it.
Keep it he does.
He's taken a fair toll of them.
Torvald, the Senator Rufio and his lady.
I'll take this life.
Can't a man be made mad by the smell of blood?
A man can understand this.
To throw the net, hold it to your right, like this.
Then throw from the tips of your fingers, like this.
Your places now.
One here, you here and you over there.
Now, start your practice. Throw your nets.
What's this?
Have they mistaken this place for an old men's hospital?
The grey-haired one?
They say there's something remarkable about him. Nothing can kill him.
Show me what you can do, grandfather.
What do we do with aging fish, grandfather?
It's time he was thrown to the gulls.
Let me be.
Hit! One!
Hit! Two!
You move on.
Bring out the first group of gladiators.
You remember me?
You drew the sign of the Master beside my plate.
How did you know I carried the sign?
Several days I've watched you breaking the bread.
Can we speak freely?
He was there in Jerusalem.
He knew the Master.
God be praised and keep you safe.
The days have been getting darker for us.
Persecution increasing.
The Emperor wants to destroy every trace of us.
But tomorrow, when the games are over and the sun is down...
...discipline will be lax...
...and there may be a chance for me to lead you to where we meet.
The Master's disciple, Peter, is here in Rome.
Seldom enough I find my way there, some way off to the catacombs.
The catacombs?
Surely it's the dead who meet there.
It may seem to you that the faith is buried.
But so is the seed before there can be a harvest.
First group, assemble.
You shall see tomorrow the life we keep there.
First group, assemble.
- Did you hear him, Barabbas?
- I heard.
One, two, one, two...
To your fighting places.
Go.
When you've taken up these positions tomorrow...
...the trumpets will sound.
And from above you, there...
...the white cloth will be thrown into the arena.
When it touches the ground, the contest will begin.
To make sure you understand, this is the way it will happen.
Kill him! Kill him!
- That's an angry crowd.
- They want blood.
They were driven to a frenzy by Sahak, who wouldn't kill his man.
If the Emperor were here, he wouldn't have had a choice.
Wait till tomorrow.
He'll get his quota of killing, if you're lucky to win.
- Not one life will he get from me.
- Won't he?
Say that to the Emperor.
He will teach you the ways.
- When he says death, death it is.
- The true God says life.
- I only answer to him.
- Hark at this man.
By God, if he contradicts the Emperor...
- Who do you call your God?
- The only one.
The rest are inventions of fear, tales taken from the past...
...they can no more help you than this breast can bleed.
Put 'em down.
- Insulting the gods before we go fight.
- What revenge will Mars take?
None at all. He doesn't exist.
Mars doesn't exist?
What do you mean, he doesn't exist?
Will you keep your mouth shut?
The real God is greater than any man's thoughts can imagine.
He made life as deep and strong as the sea.
Your gods are as shallow as a reeking pond.
He's above us and around us, in us.
Like the breath in our bodies.
And he has one law that will break our pattern.
The law is love.
Whatever we do that breaks that law condemns us.
And so that we should see what his love is...
...he sent his son to live the life of a man.
To show that God understands the life he has made.
- Who spun you this?
- What do you want us to do?
What good will he do us in the arena?
We'll lose the goodwill of the gods we know.
Tomorrow in the arena, show the Emperor that we know what life's worth.
Throw away your weapons.
Do you think all the things of the Earth and the heavens...
...have been made for no other reason except we should eat and make money...
...and spawn children and kill and die?
What a purpose for creation!
If anything's beyond belief, that is.
God said, " Burn away the old world...
"...and let a new one rise from the ashes."
As the Son of God rose from the dead, he died for us.
Ask Barabbas here the truth of what I tell you.
He saw with his own eyes the Son of God when he lived among us.
Saw him die.
Was there, in the garden, on the third morning.
You saw him, Barabbas?
- Tell us what you saw.
- What happened?
A long time ago I saw a man.
Some people say he was...
...the Son of God.
- Enough!
You've condemned yourselves.
I charge you with sedition and stirring up mutiny.
You're both under arrest.
Take them out and put them in chains.
Move now!
Let me be sure you understand the seriousness of the charge against you.
Not only with holding views proscribed by the State...
...for which the punishment is death, but of recommending those views...
...to men sworn to the State's service.
What is more, you've betrayed your faith to me...
...who brought you to this city...
...and laid me under possible suspicion of connivance in the eyes of the Emperor.
The prospect is black for you.
You know what this is?
- The stamp of the Roman State.
- Which means that you're Rome's property.
What's this cut here?
The sign of my master.
- Who do you call your master?
- The one who is my lord.
- The Son of the Father.
- In other words, the Christian sign?
A religion which sets itself up to menace government and order.
Which denies the divine authority of the Emperor.
Which preaches that the slave is equal to the free man...
...and would reduce society to anarchy.
A rebellious, insufferable doctrine.
Give me a direct answer.
Do you belong to the State?
I belong to the Lord, my god.
So, you also believe in this god?
Tell me, do you?
You don't?
Then why do you bear his name on your disc?
Isn't he your god?
Isn't that what the inscription means?
I have no god.
I don't understand.
Why then do you bear this sign of Jesus Christ, scratched on your disc?
Because I...
...tried to believe.
I'll give you the opportunity to recover your senses.
If you'll admit publicly to the men you spoke to...
...that all these things were lies, you may save your life.
Will you do this?
That would be to lose my life, not save it.
What I am is his.
But isn't life dear to you?
Yes, it is.
And you understand the cruel death that punishes mutiny and sedition?
What do you choose?
I choose my god.
Then there is no more I can do for you.
Guilty of the charge.
Execution at sunrise.
You're as mad as your god.
You, come here.
Unwise to carry around with you what you don't believe in.
It may be the Master means you to live.
He may have some greater need of you.
Some other purpose, Barabbas.
- Something else.
- Take him away.
Guards.
Now you'll have to be worth two men to take his place.
You may go.
You are to witness the punishment of this man...
...so that there can be no doubt in your mind...
...that the words he spoke to you were a gross breach of the law.
An iniquitous crime against the State.
Not only lies, but treasonable lies...
...which were not only aimed at spreading rebellion among you...
...but also to pervert your minds...
...from those acceptable religions on which the State is built.
Any man who thinks that those words are harmless...
...or thinks that he can repeat or conform to such words as this man spoke...
...let him take warning from the punishment you are about to witness.
Long live the Emperor!
Proceed, Torvald.
Positions.
Ready.
Throw.
Traitors and fools!
You'll wish this was better done.
Kill him! Kill him!
Gladiator Barabbas, you're becoming quite a legend among us, I hear.
For your remarkable persistence in life...
...we have a traditional answer to this public acclaim.
We make you a free man.
We give you your liberty.
Here is the symbol of your freedom.
I brought him to you.
This is where he would have wanted to be buried.
Our brother Sahak.
So you had to carry your dead conscience here.
Did he have to die before you cared about him?
Are you more concerned with his body than his life?
You were willing to let him go to his death alone.
Why should you help him now he doesn't need you?
How could I have helped him by being killed?
He made his own death.
What good has it done?
I had to go on living, he said.
- There was something I still had to do.
- Barabbas, why should you believe it?
When the light shone, you wouldn't accept it.
When the dark came, you denied it.
When the spirit of God beckoned, you refused it.
When Sahak says your life is kept for some purpose...
...why should you believe it?
To make a gag for your conscience, is that it?
You believe it because it suits you.
Or maybe if Sahak stood before you now then you would say you believed.
You would repent and love God.
It would be easy.
But what strength would your belief have then?
What would it matter?
Jesus of Nazareth was killed instead of me.
There must have been a reason. Why me?
Why did he choose me?
Where have you gone?
You!
Where are you?
Wait for me.
Wait!
You wait!
For God's sake, where are you?
Show me the way! I'm lost!
Which way shall I go?
- What's happening?
- Rome is burning.
Can't you see? Rome is burning.
- What happened to make the fire?
- The Christians tried to burn down Rome.
- Move! Move that case. Come on.
- Christians?
- The Christians are burning Rome!
- It's the Christians!
Fire!
They're burning away the old world.
The new kingdom is coming.
God.
You won't find me failing this time.
What are you doing, madman?
Fire of God destroying the old world.
The hour has come when all is to perish.
- Are you a Christian?
- Yes, I am.
And I'm ready for Him!
The whole world will soon be ablaze.
Do you hear that?
We're burning the way.
We're ready for his coming.
- Take him away.
- The Master!
- The Master's coming to build a new world.
- Away!
Let me go!
I must make ready for his coming!
Let me go!
Here! Get yourself out of this one.
Here's one of your kind who was caught in the act, setting light to a storehouse.
He admits he's a Christian, burning the city to start a new kingdom.
The only honest man among you.
Who are you?
We've never seen you before.
Is it true?
Were you setting fire to a storehouse?
Yes.
- We've never seen you before.
- Who are you?
My name is Barabbas.
- Barabbas, the robber.
- Barabbas, the acquitted.
This burning city is no work of ours.
This isn't how the new kingdom is going to be made.
You were wrong.
Who are you to tell me I'm wrong?
Many years ago we spoke together.
You remember?
No.
You asked me why I was making a net so far from the sea.
Jerusalem.
The street of the potters.
You were mistaken of us then as you are again now.
We didn't set fire to the city.
You've done the work of the wild beast, the Emperor.
- Are you a lunatic?
- It was his fire, you fool, not God's.
Why can't God make himself plain?
What's become of all the fine hopes?
The trumpets, the angels?
All the promises?
Every time I've seen it end up the same way, with torments and dead bodies...
...with no good come of it.
All for nothing.
Do you think they persecute us to destroy nothing?
Or do you think that what has battered on your soul...
...for twenty years has been nothing?
It wasn't for nothing that Christ died.
Mankind isn't nothing.
In his eyes, each individual man is the whole world.
He loves each man as though there were no other.
I was the opposite of everything he taught, wasn't I?
Why did he let himself be killed instead of me?
Because being farthest from him, you were the nearest.
- I'm no nearer than I was before.
- Nor any farther away.
The truth of the matter is, he's never moved from your side.
I can tell you this.
There has been a wrestling in your spirit, back and forth in your life...
...which in itself is knowledge of God.
By the conflict you have known him.
I can tell you as well, that so it will be with the coming of the kingdom.
That wrestling back and forth and the labouring of the world spirit...
...like a woman in childbirth.
We are only the beginning.
We won't see the time when the Earth is full of the kingdom.
And yet, even now, even here...
...we are at the end ourselves.
The kingdom is within us.
There is nothing more to fear.
Upon us, the years will be built.
Many years, many martyrdoms.
The ground of men is very stubborn to mature.
But men will look back to us in our day and will wonder and remember our hope.
It is the end of the day.
We shall trust ourselves to a little pain...
... and sleep.
Saying to the world:
"God's speed."
What hour is it?
Night or day?
The sixth hour goes...
...when darkness...
Darkness...
I give myself up...
...into your keeping.
It is...
...Barabbas.

- Good morning, Excellency.
- Good morning, Monsignor.
- Alfeo.
- Stefano.
Everyone was shocked at my coming here.
They think I'm trying to steal your show.
You've helped make it.
I thought I wouldn't see you till the ceremony at St. Peter's.
I won't be there.
I'm going to Warsaw tonight to meet with the Cardinals of Vienna... and I won't be back till you've left for America.
So I thought I would take this chance to tell you... well, nothing really... just to have a look at you and our old school... and slip out of here as inconspicuously as I can.
I'm glad you decided to forget protocol.
I would have hated not seeing you at all.
- Especially the way things look.
- Yes.
Poland seems to be Hitler's next target.
Once again, we may have a war to separate us.
God bless you, Stefano.
Father Fermoyle.
Your Excellency.
It's a day of glory, Stefano... though I don't like to think how long it may be before we see each other again.
I don't know when
I'll ever be back in Rome... but perhaps you'll come to Boston some day, or New York.
It's possible, when this war is over.
I'm more likely to travel in my new post at the Vatican... than I was as a seminary lector.
But, you'll come back to Rome.
Most parish priests in America don't get the chance.
You will not be like most parish priests.
I've read your new chapters.
And as usual, I think they are splendid.
But as usual... that hasn't stopped me from writing... almost as many pages of notes as there are in the manuscript.
- You must finish this book, Stefano.
- I intend to.
I just hope wherever I'm sent, it isn't too far from a decent library.
You will manage, even in America.
Over the years...
I had very few students with your special talents.
Not only scholarship.
I've watched how you handle people.
I have even watched how you handle me.
If you noticed, then it wasn't very skillful.
I am an unusually observant man.
Seriously, Stefano, I expect a lot from you.
You have a fine mind, and a way of coming to grips with life... that is, well, Roman.
Your Excellency couldn't have chosen a word to flatter me more.
But you also have a drive that can be described only as American.
It makes a good mixture.
We need that drive over here.
We need it now, in this war... if the Kaiser and his partners are ever to be defeated.
Do you think it will happen that way,
America join the Allies?
As an Italian, I hope so, but... what a nation will do is hard to predict.
Even for a member of the Vatican Diplomatic Corps?
As of today, I'm still a teacher... and I make predictions only about my students.
You know the ring I wear?
This one also was designed by Dolcettiano... in the great days of Florence.
Three times in as many centuries... there have been two bishops at once in the Quarenghi family to wear them.
But when my brother died... that was the end of the tradition.
I want you to have his ring, Stefano.
I couldn't.
A bishop's ring?
Not for now.
For when the day comes.
Keep it for then.
There he is! Steve!
- Do you see him?
- Steve!
Okay, Father, go ahead.
Florrie.
Hello, Frank.
Monie!
Is that really my little sister?
Notice anything different?
As a priest, I guess I should say no... but I'm not supposed to tell lies, either.
Where's Dad?
I hear the clergy travels free of charge on Dennis Fermoyle's car.
Is that a fact, now?
The hell, you say!
Steve!
Hello, Dad.
Look at him now, will you?
Stiff as a board, he is, in that fine Italian suit.
But no matter, we'll soon wilt the
Roman starch from that collar of yours.
Dad's already talked to his old buddy,
Monsignor Monaghan.
"Don't make it too easy for my boy,"
Dad said...
"not good for his character."
I said no such thing.
He made him promise not to promote you to bishop the first day.
But you're going to be, aren't you?
He can't avoid it.
It's nearly impossible to make cardinal, unless you're a bishop first.
Now pay your fares, the lot of you.
This is no politician looking after his own.
You get no favors from your father on the Boston Municipal.
How well the new plaster and wood matches the old.
They all comment on it, Corny.
And what do you say to that?
The job was done by the Cornelius
J. Deegan Construction Company... without charge, as a donation to the parish.
That's telling 'em, Monsignor... but let me give you some of my cards for next time it comes up.
They remember the name better if they see it written.
Thank you.
I'll see they find their way to the right pockets.
You do that.
I was forgetting to mention our drive for a new heating system.
You mentioned it.
You'll be posting a list of the contributors, no doubt.
So I have to give what people expect from a Papal Knight.
I don't know if you knew, Stephen,
I was sent a decoration from the Pope.
Knights of Malta.
Yes, my father wrote me about it.
Did he, now?
And how's old Din coming along?
Bursting out of his britches, I daresay, with pride over you.
Give him my best, will you?
And tell him it's the old days
I'm missing yet... before I was rich enough to become the white-headed boy of this parish.
Look at the size of it, will you?
Raising money is a necessary part of running a parish, I guess.
If that fancy training of yours didn't cover the care in handling of millionaires... what is it they were teaching you, then?
I specialized in ecclesiastical history... the Reformation period, what led up to it... which meant learning German, as well as Italian, of course.
German, as well as Italian, huh?
Yes, in fact, I've been working on a book about the causes of the Reformation... and the Council of Trent and the Counter Reformation.
Council of Trent?
I feel that the churchmen at the time... were late in recognizing both the growth of nationalism... and the development of scientific thought, and that hastened the Reformation.
That's the thing that did it, was it?
Of course, nothing is ever quite that simple or straightforward, but...
I disagree, Father.
Let me give you an example.
The year is 1917, and this is the city of Boston.
Boston, not Rome.
You understand the difference.
That is the church of St. John's... and you are the new curate here.
All simple, straightforward facts, are they not?
Yes, Monsignor.
I don't suppose during the course of your elegant education... you ever drove a milk wagon.
- No.
- I did, as a lad... and I learned how to tell a good milk-wagon horse 10 blocks away.
You get my meaning, Father?
She's a milk-wagon horse I'll be wanting for a curate, Father.
We don't need any racehorses at St. John's.
The Monsignor... quite a man, isn't he?
Yes, he is quite a manager.
They don't call him
"Dollar Bill" Monaghan for nothing.
You'll not find the likes of him in Rome.
So, which is it that you want to be... a historian or a diplomat, like your Roman friend...
Bishop Quarenghi.
Or a good priest, like Bill Monaghan?
Both.
But if you had to make a choice between the two?
A good priest.
The very best priest in all the world?
The best priest in the world.
And how do you expect to be that... when already you are committing the sin of pride even to think it?
Frank, will you stop that noise?
Don't you get enough of that... playing in those Scully Square movie parlors... till the Lord knows what hour of the night?
Don't worry about me, Dad.
I get plenty of sleep during the day.
Steve, listen to this. It's a new one.
Dinner's ready.
Shouldn't we wait for Mona?
She's due back from the library any minute.
The library?
Is that where she told you she was going?
What you do mean by that, Florrie?
I mean, she is more likely out with lkie Rampbell.
His name's not lkie, it's Benny.
What's the difference?
There are enough Catholic boys in this parish... without you having to run around with a rag-picking Jew.
He's not a ragpicker.
He is studying to be a dentist
He's still a Jew.
I'm sick and tired of having to do all the work around here... while she is out with that sheeny boyfriend of hers.
You like it better not having any boyfriend at all?
Slut!
Will you go up to Mona, Steve?
You've always had a special way with her.
Yes, you talk to Mona, Steve.
I'll talk to Florrie.
Monie?
It's me, Steve.
Monie.
Put your arms around me.
Remember the bear hugs you used to give me... and I'd take you down Crescent Hill on my double runner?
Before we'd start, I'd show you how to put your arms around me... and I'd say:
"No matter what happens, just hang on to me."
And you'd say, "I'll hang on, Steve."
What am I gonna do?
I'm in love with Benny.
I want to marry him.
Has he asked you?
Yes.
I asked him to wait.
He won't wait forever.
The difference in faith. It doesn't matter?
Only if it matters to you, Steve.
Does it matter?
I'd like to meet Benny.
Would you bring him over to the rectory one of these days?
I'm so glad you're back.
You're gonna fix everything.
I'm so glad you're home.
- Father, I've got a bet.
- What about?
Chick, here, says that only Catholics can get into heaven.
Everyone knows Protestants can't go to heaven.
Why can't Protestants go to heaven?
Does anyone have an answer for that?
- Father!
- Father!
'Cause they ain't Catholics.
How does that strike the rest of you?
He's right!
You're all wrong.
The Catholic Church teaches that it's possible for anyone...
Protestant, Mohammedan, Jew... anyone who does God's will according to his conscience to go to heaven.
Then what's the use of going to all this trouble to be Catholic?
Yes, Father, what's the use?
We'll take that up next Sunday.
I think we've all had enough for today.
Steve.
This is Benny Rampbell.
- How do you do, Benny?
- How do you do, Father?
The kid had a point there, don't you think?
Have you ever thought about becoming Catholic?
You know... my parents aren't too keen on the idea of my marrying a Christian, either.
Couldn't we just get married, and then try to convert each other?
No, you couldn't.
For Mona to marry you at all, she'd need special dispensation... and you'd have to pledge not to interfere with the practice of her religion... and raise your children as Catholics.
That's not exactly treating the two things as equal, is it?
It would be hypocritical if we did.
We happen to believe our church is the only true one.
If you're right, then your rules make sense.
I'm glad you think so.
And, if you're right, then a guy'd be a fool not to join up.
Would you, Benny?
Steve, I'm in love with your sister.
I want to marry her.
So, if my becoming a Catholic will make that easier...
I'll give it a try.
Benny, I love you.
- Steve, you did it!
- Not yet.
You'll have to work pretty hard.
No Sunday school stuff for me.
I'm up to my neck in what you call perfidious darkness.
We'll do our best to turn on the light.
But hasn't Darwin put the skids to Genesis?
If he's done it for us, he's done it for the Jewish faith, too.
Listen, if I was a good Jew,
I wouldn't be here.
I don't see how anyone can square this
Adam-and-Eve business with evolution.
Why not?
Good afternoon, Monsignor.
- Father. Benny.
- Good afternoon, sir.
- How're you getting along?
- All right, I guess.
Go ahead, don't let me bother you.
Father Fermoyle was asking you,
"Why not?"
Because they are mutually exclusive.
Not if you separate what is essential in the Bible.
What affects matters of faith from... the names and physical details that don't have to be taken literally.
Dogma is that there is one pair of first parents... from whom all mankind is descended.
That truth remains... whether or not evolution was the method by which God chose to create them.
I've been working on a similar question that came up when...
Copernicus and Galileo... made their discoveries about the mechanics of the universe.
What's that?
It's a book I've been writing... in my spare time.
I borrowed a quote on the subject from Bishop Quarenghi, my teacher.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
That makes everything clear.
The Bible teaches not how the heavens go... but how to go to heaven.
A pretty phrase, Father... but aren't you getting a bit away from the usual instruction?
- Benny's a tough nut to crack.
- There's nothing tough about it.
What it all amounts to in the long run, Benny... is faith.
You've got to have faith.
Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be contagious.
What's going on out there?
What's happened, Father Lyons?
A miracle, it looks like.
There's blood dripping from the statue, from her heart.
That girl, Elena, one of the new Italian immigrants... her husband was stabbed yesterday.
He was dying when they took him to the hospital.
She prayed to the Blessed Mother to save him.
She lit a candle in front of the statue.
She went back to the hospital... and her husband was sitting up in bed, asking for pasta.
Get over there, quick.
Speak Italian to them, but for heaven's sake, get them out of the church.
Children of the miraculous Queen of the heavens... let us pray.
Let us cover the Blessed Virgin with flowers.
Let us cover her with the flowers... of her litanies.
Lord, have pity on us.
Lord, have pity on us.
Christ, hear our prayer.
Holy Trinity, one single God.
Son, God, Redeemer of the world.
Holy Spirit, thou art God.
He sure does have a way with them.
Holy Mother of God.
Pray for us.
The miracle of the leaking steam pipe... courtesy of the Cornelius J.
Deegan Construction Company.
And I thought this was a special effort for my conversion.
It'll be a jolt for those people when they find out the truth.
Maybe they won't have to.
You're not gonna tell them?
It's not up to me to tell them.
Come on.
I report what we found to Monsignor Monaghan.
He reports it to Cardinal Glennon's office.
In the end, the Cardinal himself will decide what to tell them.
What do you suppose that'll be?
He'll probably just fix the steam pipe, and let the commotion die down.
But if you didn't tell them the truth, you'd be committing a fraud.
What is the truth?
That the steam pipe leaks.
That's only a fact, Benny.
Like the sun being the center of the solar system.
Facts are only small parts of a much larger truth.
Faith?
Faith.
People see blood flowing from a statue's heart.
They believe God caused it to happen.
- But he didn't.
- But he did.
God is the first cause of everything.
He made that pipe leak.
Judging from all the rust, he must've been working on that stunt for quite a while.
From all eternity.
- Frank.
- Nice party.
How're you doing?
So far, I've met the Flynns, the Foleys, the Flahertys... the Deegans, the Doogans... the O'Connors, O'Neals, McMahons, and all the clan O'Toole.
You make it sound like one of Frank's songs.
After the Irish, the Germans will be a cinch.
You'll take the war in your stride.
Except for one little problem you can help me with.
Whose side is God on?
Is he an Englishman,
Frenchman, German... or is he an American?
He certainly could have his pick.
They all claim him.
- Happy?
- I've never been happier in my life.
How'd you like to meet the Rampbells?
I'd like to, very much.
Mom, Dad...
I'd like you to meet Mona's brother,
Father Steve.
- How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Rampbell?
- Hello.
I feel for you both. There's nothing quite as lonely as being in a crowd of strangers.
Not entirely strangers, Father.
There are several men here
I've done business with for years... including our host.
Of course, I've never been invited to their homes before.
Or invited them to yours.
Or invited them to ours, it's quite true.
All right, you micks, let's have a little quiet here.
I want to propose a toast... to Mona Fermoyle and her soldier boy.
There they are.
In case you haven't already met him... the lad's name is Benny Rampbell.
But don't let the name throw you.
I have it on reliable authority... that it's soon to become a good Catholic name.
As soon as that happens, and I have this on good authority, too... that same good Catholic name will become Mona's.
So what do you say?
Let's just tack an "O" in front of it... and make the whole clan of them honorary Irishmen.
Now we know the answer.
God is an Irishman.
Come on.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's been one week since my last confession.
These are my sins.
Yes?
I slept with a man.
Are you engaged to this man?
Yes.
Couldn't you have waited until you were married?
Steve, you didn't persuade him.
Benny's not going to become a Catholic.
I thought... if we made love...
I thought I could make him change his mind.
Steve, I'm so miserable.
Please help me.
Would he agree to let your children be raised as Catholics?
No.
He says that isn't fair.
He won't marry me at all, unless I take him just the way he is.
Then you cannot be married.
He says, "Let's leave all religion out of it and...
"get married by a judge."
That wouldn't be a marriage.
You'd be living in mortal sin.
What else can I do?
Why do you think I came here?
I want you to tell me what to do.
Hard as it may be, you must give him up.
Is that all you can say?
You must stop these illicit relations immediately.
- Steve.
- Father.
This is me.
And I'm a priest.
What you've done is immoral and cheap.
It wasn't cheap.
I'm in love with him.
Is that a sin?
Unless it's subordinated to a higher love, the love of God, yes.
Steve, you told me to hang on.
I'm just trying to hang on.
Help me.
Please help me.
Benny'll be going overseas soon.
He may be gone for a long time.
There's a saying in Italian:
"Love makes time pass, time makes love pass."
For these and all other sins that I have committed, I ask forgiveness.
For your penance, say three rosaries.
Now make a good act of contrition.
My God, I am heartily sorry
I have offended thee.
And a firm resolution to sin no more.
I can't do that!
You must.
I shouldn't have come here.
Cardinal Glennon will see you now, Father.
Good afternoon, Father Fermoyle.
Your Eminence.
I take the ring off for Bach.
Everyday I practice for an hour.
My staff encouraged me.
It may be that they hate music and enjoy hearing what I do to it.
Or perhaps they've learned the more
I pound the piano the less I pound them.
They're probably right.
I'd hardly call it pounding, Your Eminence.
You play very well.
The Goldberg Variations are a great challenge to the amateur.
But wasn't Your Eminence playing the Chromatic Fantasy?
When you compliment me as a musician,
I must find out whether you know music.
Not that I'm trying to trap you.
That's not my purpose.
It isn't?
No, it's because of my infernal weakness for flattery.
You see, Fermoyle, I'm incorrigibly vain... not about my personal charms... but about certain accomplishments... that have nothing to do with my function as a priest.
Because of this flaw in my nature,
I must always be on my guard.
Not only for the sake of my soul, but for yours.
I've read your book.
I'm no historian, but it seems a comprehensive treatment of the subject.
Thank you.
Why did you send it to me?
Because Bishop Quarenghi liked it very much and he felt...
- Quarenghi, of the Vatican.
- Yes.
He felt the next step would be to get your imprimatur to publish it.
Quarenghi read your book?
Yes. In fact, he helped me with a great deal of it.
You were close friends with this Bishop Quarenghi?
He was my teacher.
I admire him very much.
He's in the office of the Secretary of State?
Yes, he is assistant to Cardinal Giacobbi.
Giacobbi, whose main passion in life is to guard the Holy Father... from contaminating contacts with non-ltalians.
Cardinal Giacobbi would have good reason to like your book.
I'm not sure I understand...
It deals with a time when the Western Hemisphere... had little or no ecclesiastical significance.
Tell me, why did you write it?
- Why?
- Yes, why? For what reason?
- What did you expect to gain?
- I didn't expect to gain...
Fame?
- No, it was just...
- Admiration in Rome?
The subject interested me...
A job in the Vatican, with the Secretary of State... close to your Italian friends?
It was a field that had been neglected and...
Come, now. Examine your motives.
You are an ambitious priest.
I recognize all the symptoms.
You feel you're too good for parish work.
I have never said that.
Don't you think you're wasted here?
Your gifts for language... for scholarship, diplomacy...
All these are wasted at St. John's.
Admit it.
No, Your Eminence.
- The truth.
- I will serve wherever I'm sent.
Father Fermoyle, do you think there's more in you... than being a mere parish priest?
The truth.
Of course I do.
You wanted the truth, Your Eminence.
Ambition is a disease in any man.
In a priest, it can be fatal.
But at your age, it may still be curable.
We shall begin your treatment at once.
Cold climate, simple diet.
Stonebury. Perfect.
Stonebury will be your spiritual sanitarium.
You are now curate at Stonebury.
The parish church is called St. Peter's, no irony intended.
You will assist Father Halley.
A truly remarkable man.
As a pastor, he's a total failure, but... as an individual, he is without vanity... ambition.
From him, you can learn humility.
Goodbye, Father Fermoyle.
Steve!
Where've you been?
Where's Dad and the rest?
I tried to get you before you left St. John's.
- What's wrong?
- Have you seen Mona?
- No.
- Any message from her?
- No.
- She's gone.
She didn't come home last night.
We don't know where she is.
With Benny?
No, his regiment went overseas yesterday.
Let me know the minute you hear anything.
Send me a wire at Stonebury.
Call me. Tell Mom and Dad not to worry.
- Father Fermoyle?
- Yes.
Bonjour, Father.
Jump on.
Father Halley sent me to pick you up.
Me, Hercule Menton.
I'm very glad to meet you, Hercule.
Father Halley.
Father Fermoyle.
Sorry I couldn't meet you myself.
I was glad to be met at all. Thank you.
- You make a good fire.
- I was going to make some tea.
Good, I'll just take this off.
- Here, let me help you off with that coat.
- Thank you.
I'm not used to company.
You should ask them to send you a curate.
I'm afraid I've had too many favors from His Eminence.
Besides, there's hardly enough revenue here to support one priest... let alone two.
Things will be looking up now that you're here.
And a remarkably good collection this Sunday.
Quite a haul for St. Peter's.
Tomorrow we'll buy some coffee to celebrate... your arrival with festivities.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
You should be in bed.
This'll pass, it always does.
- Father, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.
Sit down.
Let's have some bread and tea.
I'll be all right.
- Have some fish.
- No, thank you, it's enough.
I always eat my principal meal at midday.
- Would you like the fish?
- No, thank you.
In the morning,
I'll show you around the parish.
Why don't you rest tomorrow?
I can manage alone.
Bless us... and these, thy gifts, which we are about to receive from thy bounty... through Christ, our Lord...
Amen.
Father, I insist you eat that fish.
You must be hungry after your long trip.
Father Fermoyle.
- Good morning, Hercule.
- Good morning, Father.
- How are you?
- Come in, come in.
My daughter, Lalage.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Lalage.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
- How is Father Halley?
- Not too well, I'm afraid.
I'm glad they sent someone to help him.
And this is my wife, Adele.
Will you stay and eat with us, Father?
Don't worry, there's plenty.
No, thank you.
I'd better be getting back to Father Halley.
Wait...
Father Halley needs a hot meal.
This'll make you feel better.
How long have you had these spells?
A long time?
What does the doctor say?
Well, he...
- You've seen a doctor, haven't you?
- Yes, no.
He couldn't diagnose it.
He said I'd have to go to the hospital for a week for a series of tests.
And?
We can't afford it.
The diocesan can afford it.
No, you mustn't ask him.
But you're sick.
His Eminence mustn't know.
He mustn't know that I'm sick.
Cardinal Glennon? Why not?
Well, you see... he gave me my first parish...
St. Anselm's in Stowe.
It was a small church with a big mortgage.
I couldn't lift it.
He sent me to Needham.
It was a prosperous parish.
There was money in the bank.
And I ran Needham into debt.
His Eminence warned me.
Then he sent me to...
Malden, lpsfield... always some place lower in his favor.
There's no more favor left, now.
He's disappointed in me.
He mustn't know... that I've failed again.
Father Fermoyle, your brother phoned the store... to come to Boston as quickly as you can.
Mona.
What do you guys want?
We want to talk to our sister.
It sure don't look like she wants to talk to you.
Mona, please.
What do you want?
We want you to come home.
Why?
You're breaking their hearts, Mona.
Please come home.
All right, I'll come home.
You don't think Mom will mind if I bring Ramón home with me, do you?
He spends a lot of his time in jail and he hasn't really learned to read yet.
You can tell her he's a Catholic.
Mona, listen to me.
- Benny won't be gone...
- Shut up.
We'll start all over again.
We'll try to work out a way that you and Benny can be married.
I promise I'll do everything I can.
Why don't you leave me alone!
What do you want from me?
I just want you to be happy.
Is that all?
Don't you want to forgive me, too?
Isn't that what you priests usually like to do the most?
- He's not your enemy, Mona.
- God will forgive you.
Will you hear my confession, Father?
I'll be glad to hear your confession at the proper time...
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
- Don't do this.
- I'll do anything I damn well please!
I've had it.
I'm through. I'm through with you and I'm through with your... pious, mealy-mouthed, hypocritical religion.
And I'm through with your God, too.
The next time you talk to him, you tell him that for me.
Come on, lover, let's dance.
It's not your fault.
Yes, it is.
- Lalage.
- Hello, Father.
Did you do all this?
You said look after Father Halley while you were gone. So I did.
- The doctor's with him now.
- What doctor?
Dr. Carter.
I got him to come up from Lynchburgh.
I work in his office sometimes.
Now that you're back,
I better be going home.
It was very kind of you to do so much.
It's very little compared to what he's done.
Father Halley?
When I was a child, Grand-mere died.
She was very old, very frightened... very religious.
Father Halley was sick himself, but he stayed with her night and day... prayed with her, helped her die well.
I'll be back to fix supper.
Doctor?
Father Fermoyle?
I'm afraid your pastor's a very sick man.
What is it?
The name of the disease? I can tell you, but very little else about it.
It's called multiple sclerosis.
We don't know its cause, and there's no cure for it.
It's a breakdown of the entire nervous system.
It can develop quickly or slowly.
But always in the same direction.
How far has it gone with Father Halley?
Near the end.
Has he always had this lack of energy?
I think so. I'm not sure how long.
Chances are he's been slowly dying all his adult life.
It's amazing he was able to function at all.
- What can we do for him now?
- He'll need full-time care.
He ought to be in a hospital or a nursing home.
If he's going to die, he'll die as a pastor in his own bed, in his own parish.
That's liable to be harder on you than it is on him.
Thank you.
You give him this as directed.
- Is this medicine very expensive?
- Yes.
The longer he lasts, the more it will cost.
It's never agreeable to watch someone go.
Forgive me for the long time I take.
Doesn't any of this bother you?
No, it's only nature.
It's strange.
What is strange?
For a girl who's young, attractive... to spend her days, her nights like this.
But you are a priest.
You must understand what it is to want to be of use.
You see, I have my vocation, too.
I have been accepted by the Geraldines.
The Geraldines?
The nursing sisterhood.
Yes, I know.
They take care of the incurable.
The incurable and the dying.
And that's the life you want?
That is the life I was born for.
Did you ever see this ring before?
Yes, it used to be mine.
Where did you get it?
- It was given to me.
- By whom?
By a friend.
Where did you get the ring?
Your fence, I believe, as you say in the underworld, was pinched.
One of the items recovered was this ring.
The police thought it might have been stolen from a bishop.
But the Karaghousian twins... claimed they bought it from one Father Fermoyle.
We've never had a priest working with the Mafia before.
But I suppose during your stay in Rome, you made many interesting contacts.
I had no choice, Your Eminence.
I had to work my way through the seminary... selling opium in St. Peter's Square.
- You're not afraid of me, are you?
- No.
Why not? Most people are.
Maybe it's because you remind me of my father.
He's sometimes called
Din the Downshouter.
But his roar is the only fierce thing about him.
He's a lucky man to have a son... who's not afraid of him.
But about this ring... why did you sell it?
- I needed the money.
- What for?
For private reasons, Your Eminence.
There are no private reasons between a priest and his archbishop.
I needed the money to pay for Father Halley's medical expenses.
- Is he ill?
- He's dying, Your Eminence.
- Why wasn't I told?
- He didn't want you to know.
Father O'Brien, have the car brought around.
Ned?
Your Eminence.
- Larry.
- How are you, Larry?
Giving everybody a bad time, as usual.
You know me, Ned.
I've let you down again.
No, it's I who've let you down.
Who else would have put up so long with an old muddler like me?
You're no such thing.
Now, Larry... no more of that silver tongue of yours... that we always said would talk you to the top.
The top of a mountain of worldly vanity.
I do want to thank you for giving me this parish.
The poorest in the diocese.
It was rich to me.
And then you sent me Father Fermoyle.
Vain, ambitious Roman puppy.
He's rather like you were, Larry.
That's a mortal blow.
I mean in his goodness.
Would you let him take my place here?
He'll make a good pastor, I know.
People love him already.
Grand idea. Thank you, Ned.
Would you do me one last favor?
Anything.
Would you give me extreme unction?
I'd consider it a great honor, Ned.
It'll be over soon. I hope.
You'll have the job of shutting down the church.
Send all the records to the dean at Averill.
But, Your Eminence...
I've kept the church open only for his sake.
- But you told him you were going to...
- I thanked him for his idea.
I happen to have another one for you.
But these people need a church.
A priest will come Sundays for Mass.
All else will be done through Averill.
Once a week isn't enough.
You must learn that when I've made up my mind...
I don't like interminable discussion, otherwise you'll be no use to me... as my secretary.
- Are you sure it's the same guy?
- Absolutely.
And now, we proudly present...
Bobby and his Adora-Belles.
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take great pleasure in presenting... that suave Tiger of the Tango:
Ramón Gongaro and his partner.
That isn't Mona.
Let's go.
- Where's Mona?
- I don't know.
Where is she?
- I haven't seen her for five months.
- Where did you see her last?
- In Albany. She left the act there.
- You mean you left her there.
- No, I told her...
- Told her what?
I told her I'd pay.
- Pay for what?
- For an abortion. But she didn't want...
Great, our only lead and you have to knock him cold.
What's going on there?
It's our friend, Officer.
He's a bit under the weather, I'm afraid.
What with the chilly night... and the need for a nip to keep one warm.
- Could I be getting your friend a cab?
- That would be most kind of you, Officer.
- Where is she?
- 5 Stanhope Lane, I think.
A noble and lonely task it is, preserving the law and order on a night like this.
Thank you, Officer.
I'm Ramón.
- What do you want?
- Where's Mona?
Second floor, in the back.
Who are your friends?
Second floor, in the back.
Mona, it's me.
Put your arms around me, just hang on.
I'm Dr. Parks.
- Are you the husband?
- No.
She has no husband.
She's our sister.
Your sister's been in labor for several days.
She's lost a great deal of blood.
Why has she received no medical attention?
Because we didn't know where she was.
Her pelvic structure is abnormally small.
The child's head is unusually large.
Normal delivery is impossible.
You can perform a cesarean, can't you?
It's much too late for that.
But we can save her.
I'll need your permission as next of kin to do a fetal craniotomy.
- A craniotomy?
- Yes.
We have to crush the child's head.
You want to kill the child?
You can't let Mona die.
I take it this is some sort of religious scruple?
It's a Commandment. "Thou shalt not kill."
But it's all right to kill Mona?
If Mona dies because we won't... commit a murder to save her, she dies a natural death.
But the baby...
We'd be taking a creature of God's... alive, with a soul.
And deliberately kill it.
I won't permit you to kill Mona.
Excuse me, there's not much time.
Are you a member of this family?
No.
Then which of you has the final say here?
He does.
I can't give you my permission to commit murder.
Can I see her?
You have to be quick about it, unless you want to lose both of them.
Monie, can you hear me?
Hear.
Say after me...
O, my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee.
O... thee.
O, my God.
God...
O, my God...
All right, Father, you'll have to go now.
Steve!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Regina
Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday. What a big girl!
- Blow out the candles.
Give it a try.
Blow out the other one. Blow it out.
Two, one more.
Get in.
Father Callahan packed a bag for you.
Whatever he forgot, you can buy in Rome.
Rome?
Yes, the Pope died this morning.
What does the Captain say?
We've lost three days.
If it clears tomorrow, we can make up one.
He'll have to do better than that.
The only thing that's keeping me alive... is the thought of... being there in time to vote for a new pope.
To go through what I'm going through now... would be...
- Where's my trunk?
- They promised to send it right over.
- What's happening?
- Nothing.
There should be smoke soon, white or dark.
This ballot is taking a long time.
Maybe it'll be dark.
Maybe there's still no majority.
Would you prefer that?
What difference does one more ballot make if it's a deadlock?
The American Church has a right to participate.
It's white!
Yes, Your Eminence, right away.
It's all wound up.
Stephen, good of you to come down.
Sit yourself.
And how have you been occupied, this splendid Roman day?
Your private audience must have gone very well.
What's he like, the new pope?
Amazing, the way he takes it all in his stride.
The man was made cardinal only eight months ago.
I brought up a point of procedure for the next conclave.
A procedure for what happens when he dies?
- That must have been a bit delicate.
- He seemed quite detached about it.
I explained that no matter how much faster ships they build... ten days is still too short a time to get from the United States to Rome.
He agreed to make it 15 days.
Congratulations.
That's quite an accomplishment.
Not my only one today.
Before I forget, your... bishop's ring.
You'll be needing it one of these days.
The Holy Father, it seems, is genuinely interested in America.
I called his attention to the almost complete absence... of our countrymen from the ranks of the Secretariat of State.
From there it was only a step to persuading him... it'd be difficult for the Vatican to function in the future without your services.
You'll be a domestic prelate,
Monsignor Fermoyle.
Entitled to wear the violet cassock and manteletta.
Well, Stephen?
What's the matter?
It isn't an easy thing to explain.
What isn't?
Speak up, man.
I can't accept a post at the Vatican.
Can't accept?
- It's not a matter of choice.
- In this case, it is.
I have to leave the priesthood.
But that's impossible.
- You can't suddenly...
- It isn't sudden.
I've been working up to this for years.
I'm only telling you now because...
What a masterpiece of timing!
An hour ago, at the Pope's request I was listing your virtues to Cardinal Giacobbi.
What a story he'll make of this, with his anti-American prejudice.
You set the whole hemisphere back a decade.
I'm deeply sorry for any embarrassment this may cause you, but I hardly think...
I don't want to hear what you think.
Now or ever.
Go, do you hear me? Go!
Our conversation is over.
You're dismissed! Go.
Yes?
Your Eminence.
You didn't even explain to me why you want to leave the priesthood.
I should have.
I didn't get the right opportunity.
It's been in your mind for so long.
May I sit?
- Please do, Your Eminence.
- Why didn't you tell me before?
I don't know.
I wasn't clear enough about what I really thought.
I must know what's behind this extraordinary decision of yours.
I'm not sure I could separate one reason from the others and say:
"That's what did it."
I don't think I was meant to be a priest to begin with.
It wasn't my idea.
My parents decided it when I was a baby.
I can't remember a time when it wasn't an established thing.
Like Dad being the one to go out and earn a living...
Mom staying home to care for the house and kids. Nobody ever questioned it.
I never questioned it.
A dollar a week was put aside for my education.
A dollar a week out of a motorman's pay.
By the time I was in seventh grade my brother was calling me "the Cardinal."
This morning I'd have said he had the makings of a prophet.
The only doubt I had, I wasn't sure
I had the strength to be a good priest... to deny myself what had to be denied... to live without the softness of a woman.
On the other side, there was the scholastic part.
I liked my courses, I was good at them.
As long as it was all theory and no practice...
I felt I was where I belonged.
But then came the time when I was on my own... when I had to function as God's anointed... answering people's questions about what was right, what was wrong... making decisions for them.
And one day, it was my own sister who needed my help.
And I found I couldn't help her.
Because what she needed was a man, a friend, a brother.
And all I could be was a judge with a set of rules.
And finally the time came when my being a priest meant she had to die.
I did what I had to do, I know that.
What I had to do as a priest, as an agent of God's law...
I couldn't do what a layman would do in the same situation:
Pretend that he'd never heard of the law.
I don't challenge the rules.
I just don't want to be the one to enforce them.
Not for anybody's sister.
I don't want the power over other people's lives.
I can't face the responsibility.
That's what it really comes down to.
I sit in the confessional, listening to someone tell his sins... and I'm the one who's trembling in terror.
I don't know what will become of me.
I must find what else I can do.
But I think, I pray... that there may be another kind of life for me.
A life I was meant for... that will let me sleep nights.
Steve...
I'm going to ask you to do something for me... because I think you're wrong about yourself.
I think I see your problem more objectively than you can.
Regardless of how it came about, you were meant to be a priest.
I'm going to ask you to postpone your decision.
There's something
I can do as your bishop.
It's seldom done, but I can grant you a leave of absence from active priesthood.
I'll tell Giacobbi... it's for reasons of health. And it is.
The health of your soul.
Priesthood isn't something you can put on and take off... like the cassock you wear.
It's part of you.
Think about it, Steve.
Take a year, take two years.
If at the end of that time, you're still of the same mind...
I'll do all in my power to get you a dispensation from your vows.
But... should you wish to remain a priest...
I'm sure the Holy Father can be persuaded to keep the position open for you here.
Will you do this much, Steve... for me and for yourself?
Because of the holiday, we won't be meeting again for two weeks.
Before our next class, I would like you to prepare a conversation in English... about a trip in an automobile from Vienna to Salzburg.
Until then, auf Wiedersehen.
'Bye, sir.
I hope you have very fine holidays.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again in 14 days.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you, same to you.
Yes, Miss Lederbohl?
Nothing. Have a nice holiday.
Thank you.
Mr. Fermoyle, do you mind if I walk with you?
- No, not at all.
- We go the same way.
Tell me about America.
- In 25 words, or less?
- Or more.
I've got all afternoon and evening if you need it.
- I want to be prepared.
- Prepared for what?
My dream is to go to America someday... where people think about the future, instead of always the past.
Please invite me for a cup of coffee.
All right.
Where would you like to go in America?
First to New York, of course.
Then, I haven't made up my mind yet.
Where do you think I should go?
- Where are you from?
- Boston.
Boston. That's in Massakewsetts.
Massachusetts.
Tell me about Boston.
All of a sudden I don't know what to say.
I was born in Boston, grew up there, with my family.
When I was a boy, we used to swim in the river...
I guess that's hardly an inducement to visit Boston.
I will go to Boston.
Tell me, what do you do?
- I teach.
- I mean when you're not teaching.
Do you go out to the theater, to parties?
Who are your friends?
I tried to find out, but no one seems to know.
Sometimes I think all you do is sit alone in your room in the Stallburggasse.
How do you know where I live?
I followed you.
You're different than other men.
"From" other men.
- You know how to wait.
- How to wait for what?
For "whom."
What are you going to do over the holidays?
I guess I'll just sit all by myself in my room in the Stallburggasse.
- You want to know something?
- Yes.
I won't let you do that.
Before the war there was no choice for a girl, only to be married.
Now there are not enough men.
Families have lost their money.
Most of my friends have jobs, or try to find them.
So people think I'm lucky to have a rich young man who wants to marry me.
Do you? Think you're lucky?
I'm not sure.
For me to work at a job, that is not to be a woman.
I think there's one thing I could do well.
One thing I was born for.
To love a man.
To love him so much that my whole life is to make him happy.
If that's true, then I should think...
When it is my whole life, it is important I find the right man.
- All I do is talk about myself.
- And about Vienna.
And you talk about America.
But not about Stephen Fermoyle.
Not much to talk about.
I've been in Europe about a year and a half.
Teaching, mostly.
First in Milan, then Munich, now Vienna.
I just go wherever the
International Language School sends me.
But what did you do before?
I mean, in Boston. What did you do there?
Why did you come to Europe?
Aren't we supposed to get off here?
The abbey was founded in 1410... the church built in a rich Baroque style...
It has a tower. Possibly the finest
Baroque tower of Austria.
You sound like Baedeker.
I'm just trying to keep it impersonal.
The chief attractions of the interior are the stucco reliefs on the ceiling.
The altar paintings by Schmidt of Krems.
The pulpit richly carved by his father,
Johann Schmidt.
- And the choir stalls...
- Yes, I know all about them.
I've been here before.
- You have?
- Many times.
Why?
I come here to pray.
You're a strange man.
I'm a priest, Annemarie.
I'm on a leave of absence.
Once in a great while, when a priest is unsure of his vocation... he is granted time to think about it.
What happens when your time is over?
I must decide whether I want to go on being a priest... or ask for a dispensation from my vows, if I can get one.
In the meantime, those vows are still binding.
Will it be harder for you to be with me, now that you've told me?
No harder than before, I think.
Because if I thought...
I was having an influence, directly or not directly... on what you will decide...
Yes, if you did?
I would make it, how does one say?
A full-time career.
Annemarie.
There will be no arguments about tonight.
You have to see a Viennese ball, and this is the last one of the season.
I rented everything you need.
Look.
Tails... evening shirt, white tie...
- west.
- "Vest."
And a cape.
And Manschettenknöpfe.
How do you call that?
- Cufflinks.
- Cufflinks. And this?
Studs.
And chapeau claque.
- Good evening, Kurt.
- Good evening.
- You look wonderful tonight.
- Thank you.
I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Fermoyle.
Stephen, this is Kurt von Hartman.
- Herr von Hartman.
- Mr. Fermoyle, how do you do?
- You're American, aren't you?
- Yes.
Then you are used to lending your treasures to impoverished Europe.
May I have this dance please? Annemarie?
Excuse me.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I heard you say you were from America.
Is it really true one is not allowed to drink... even beer and wine?
Are they insane to make this Prohibition?
The people who voted for it obviously think that any means is justified... to eliminate the evils of drunkenness.
Excuse me.
You know what that Prohibition is like?
It's like they want to eliminate the evils of rape... and so they pass a law against making love.
Can you imagine a life without making love?
Excuse me.
- I'm sorry, Stephen.
- For what?
For leaving you alone.
At a ball you should dance.
But you can't.
He seems like a very nice fellow.
Kurt? Yes, he is.
He's the one who wants to marry you?
Yes. Are you jealous?
I'm a priest, Annemarie.
But I'm also a man.
Men can show their feelings, but a priest has to learn how to hide them.
I can't hide them anymore.
I think I'm in love with you.
I know I'm in love with you.
I cannot ask you to kiss me while you're still married to the Church.
But in Vienna, even for a married man... it is a sin not to dance a waltz.
You answer this letter from Philadelphia.
Tell them there will be no private audiences for at least six weeks.
Welcome to Vatican City, Father Gillis.
Monsignor Fermoyle.
Your letter to the Holy Father was passed on to me... as a consultant on American affairs.
He'll see me?
The Holy Father will really see me?
I'm afraid I couldn't arrange that.
But I have arranged for you to tell your story to Cardinal Giacobbi.
That's the next best thing to a private audience with the Pope.
I didn't know if I'd hear back at all.
Since I mailed my letter the day I got to Rome...
I've been waiting to be called to the phone.
Shall we go along?
His Eminence is expecting us.
Fermoyle, come in, come in.
So, this is the American priest you told us about.
I'll come back when you're finished.
No, stay. It will not take long, will it?
Monsignor Fermoyle and Cardinal Quarenghi are old friends.
You find yourself in a nest of diplomats, Father.
That means that if anyone of us says exactly what he's thinking... it's a slip of the tongue.
Sit down.
Please, tell us what we can do for you.
Father Gillis's parish is in the state of Georgia, in a town called Lamar.
His congregation raised the money for him to come here.
That's very interesting.
St. Jude, Your Eminence.
It's called St. Jude, my church.
The saint of lost causes.
We should like not to lose this cause.
You see... there is only one Catholic school in that part of Georgia.
And, well... that school will not take the children of my parish because they're black.
- Well?
- Well, Your Eminence... is that a Christian thing to do?
It is against Christian principles for a Catholic school... to turn away a Catholic child because of race.
Of course it is.
But we have the most precise machinery... for the proper enforcement of these principles.
I did what was proper.
I went to the dean of the district,
Monsignor Whittle.
He said he would never ever let colored children in their school.
And your bishop?
I wrote him and didn't get an answer.
Then you decided that the only recourse left to you... was to come to Rome and tell your troubles to the Pope?
Your pardon, Eminence.
But one thing happened before Father Gillis decided to come.
His church was burned to the ground.
Quite a few of the folks in my parish... they feel it's time to make some changes.
So a bunch of them went and threw a picket line around that white school.
They threw what?
They marched in front of the school with signs, protesting the discrimination.
Then I got a lot of phone calls... and letters with no names signed.
And then one night, these men with white hoods... they burned my church.
Barbarians.
But still it's scarcely a tribute to your priestly discretion, is it... that your concern with these peculiar local politics... has left you without a church?
Politics, my dear Giacobbi?
The desecration, of course, is a moral issue.
I was speaking of Father Gillis's activities.
But discrimination is a moral issue, too.
It is not necessary to tell me... that race prejudice is contrary to the teachings of Christ and his church.
The question is, whether it is wise to use methods... that tend to be inflammatory.
I'm not sure that we can afford to use methods that tend to be glacial.
The truth of the matter is that to the non-white majority of the world... there is no more critical test of our democracy...
Democracy, my dear Fermoyle, is neither the ultimate... nor necessarily the best form of government.
It is simply the favorite doctrine of a country... discovered by an Italian, who thought he was going someplace else.
Your Eminence suggests a stimulating topic for discussion... but my point is that what happens to freedom in America... is important to the rest of the world.
But isn't your precious separation of church and state... a part of that freedom?
Aren't you always telling us we may not intrude... in the domestic affairs of your country in any way?
By your own logic, it is foolish... to challenge the deepest feelings and convictions... of the people of...
What is the name of the place?
- Georgia, Your Eminence.
- Georgia.
Father Gillis, may I suggest that your primary obligation is not... to political and social reform... but to the mortal souls of your flock.
Thank you, Monsignor, for bringing us Father Gillis.
We're always happy to meet a brother in Christ.
Let's get back to our work now.
I really don't remember where we left off.
Is that it?
I'd hoped we could dissuade him.
What will you do when you get back?
Thank you for your support.
I must go there, Alfeo.
I told him he could count on my help and then I failed him.
You went as far as you possibly could within the limits of your function.
There was another time somebody relied on me for help.
I did everything within my function for her, and it wasn't enough.
If you made a mistake with your sister... if you were too young to be both priest and brother to her... you've atoned for that a long time ago.
You don't have to find new ways to torture yourself.
I just don't want to realize again that it's too late to accomplish something.
What is there to accomplish by following Father Gillis?
I don't know, but I know I have to do it.
I don't think it will be a surprise if I say... the Pope has given some thought to naming you a bishop.
I've heard a certain amount of talk.
- You can't tell me it doesn't matter to you.
- It matters very much.
But it also matters to me what happens to Gillis.
I'll try not to compromise the Holy See.
I don't have to be an official emissary.
You still need the Holy Father's permission... which means Giacobbi's, unfortunately.
Do you suppose the thought might enter his mind... that I could make a fool of myself in Georgia?
It might.
What if you started him thinking along that line?
Why would I want to discredit you?
It might occur to him that this trip could lessen my chances to become a bishop.
Which could be just the incentive he needs to grant me permission to go.
Heaven forgive me for starting you off in diplomacy.
All right, Father.
Uncle Steve, it's so wonderful to see you.
Regina, I'd like you to meet a shipboard friend of mine, Father Eberling.
Father, I'm sorry. This is awful.
I don't imagine Father Eberling found it too painful.
Nicest welcome home I ever had.
Now.
Uncle Steve.
I'm so glad you're you, I mean, not him.
You're so much better looking, and younger.
With that blarney and your looks, you'll have your pick of husbands.
- Anything to declare?
- Nothing.
Thank you, Father.
Yeah, I'll get the bags.
Steve.
Boy, you look great.
How do you keep the old weight down?
Prayer, Frank. And a strict calorie count.
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.
No money, but I'm knocking 'em dead every night.
Singing in one of the best speakeasies in town.
I hope to be able to hear you before I go back.
What are your plans?
That's the trouble.
You shouldn't have come to New York.
Who said I shouldn't?
Am I some sort of an old lady...
I meant I have to catch a train this afternoon. We barely have time for lunch.
But it's worth it.
I don't like you spending the money.
Round-trip fares for you and Regina?
- Are you really sorry I brought her?
- She's an absolute delight, ravishing.
Having her around has made it easier for me to accept God's will.
Seeing her now has made it easier for me.
Excuse me?
Where does Father Gillis live?
- Right over there.
- Thank you.
- Monsignor.
- Father Fermoyle from Boston, for now.
Do come in.
Monsignor Whittle, this is Father Fermoyle.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
Sheriff Dubrow.
What brings you to Lamar, Father?
I'm a friend of Father Gillis.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
I've already said what I come to say.
There's a law against arson in this state.
So I had to do my job.
When Gillis here, Father Gillis... made out a complaint,
I brought the charges.
Tomorrow he can get up in the trial and testify.
That is, unless you can talk some sense into him.
He's your boy, not mine.
Know what I mean?
I don't. What do you mean?
That there's trouble for everybody, for him, for me, for the Church.
- What are you doing here, Father?
- I told you, I'm a friend of Father Gillis.
As a friend, I wish you'd tell this hard-headed boy...
He's not a boy, Monsignor, he's a priest.
Do you presume to correct my terminology, Father?
I simply meant to remind you that we are all brothers in Christ.
Then, my Yankee brother, will you tell this Father Gillis... that he must not testify?
'Cause people around here, they're in an awful ugly mood.
Do you want to testify?
- Yes, Father.
- Good.
Father Gillis will be at the trial tomorrow.
That does it.
That just about puts the lid on it.
Look, you know nothing of the conditions around here...
Monsignor, a church has been burned.
Charges have been brought, testimony must be given.
What is so unusual about due process of law?
I recognize a Yankee... sanctimonious self-righteousness.
You will not testify, Father.
You will withdraw your complaint.
You... you will give me the name of your superior to whom I will report you.
You were sent here from Rome?
I'm here unofficially.
My presence is a confidential matter between us.
But it's my strong opinion... that we must allow Father Gillis to act as he sees fit.
Just as you say, Monsignor.
I assume that he can count on you for your support in whatever he does.
- Yes, but...
- Then perhaps we can discuss the details... of that support on the way into town... if you can drive me.
I'd like to find a hotel.
Of course. I'd be delighted.
I'll get in touch with you later.
I can't believe you're here.
I didn't think anybody cared.
Have you so little faith?
The hotels are on the other side of the square.
Who told you that?
I don't need anybody to tell me, Father.
It's in the Bible.
Is it also God's law to burn churches?
We had nothing to do with that, Father.
I'm a good Catholic.
They must be members of your congregation.
You've got to see the problem, Monsignor.
We're in the minority here, too.
I'm sure you wouldn't have permitted this demonstration if you'd known of it.
I'll see that it's stopped immediately.
Good people, can I just talk to you for a minute?
What's going on there?
You want something, mister?
I need a room for a couple of nights.
It just so happens we don't have any rooms available.
I kind of get the impression you've been meddling, padre.
Looked to me like it was you who got that picket line called off.
For a Catholic priest to offer advice to members of his faith is not meddling.
Maybe you don't know what's going on in this town.
Some nigger is trying to make trouble for some white folks.
- Some nigger priest.
- Some nigger Catholic priest.
You can't really get much lower than that.
Perhaps you could recommend a good tourist home?
If you're a tourist, get touring before you've got something to be sorry for.
You ain't going to find a bed tonight.
Not in this town.
I don't know, Cecil.
Maybe he could find a bed in niggertown.
Yeah, that's right.
Maybe some licorice-stick bitch won't mind squeezing over for you.
What do you think, Cecil?
I think we got ourselves a little job this evening.
Give me the Sheriff's office.
All right.
What do you call this thing?
I mean, the fancy name?
A crucifix.
Yeah, that's what the nigger called it when we took it from him.
Only he was queer for it.
He kept wanting to kiss it while we was strengthening his character.
We ain't gonna stand for that kind of stuff.
You know what you're going to have to do with this little old statue, padre?
You're going to spit on it.
And what would that prove... except you've been able to scare one priest into defiling the image of Christ?
Maybe that's just plenty.
You'll tell them other nigger-lovers up north they ain't welcome here.
Now you spit on it.
I said for you to spit on it!
All right, keep going. Give it to him!
Maybe he needs a little music.
Got your harmonica?
Guaranteed to heal cuts, ringworm, harness sores and... foot welts.
Who are you?
Name's Lafe.
You live in Lamar?
All my life.
Are you Catholic?
No.
Then why are you doing this?
I ain't doing much.
Do you think you can walk?
I can try.
I'll take you to Owassa Junction.
You can get a train north there.
I'm going back to Lamar.
There's a trial starting there this morning.
In a quiet way, you're kind of a hard man, aren't you?
My car's just across the field.
You knew where to find me.
You were one of them last night.
When you start something you don't always know how you'll feel about it later.
- Last night...
- Don't try to talk. Play.
- Stefano!
- Alfeo.
Monsignor Fermoyle.
We had such a desire to talk to you, but you couldn't be reached.
I came back to Europe on a small ship, Your Eminence.
I needed time for meditation.
Your publicity traveled more quickly.
It served to remind us all of your flair for the theatrical.
If I'd chosen the theatricals,
I'd have staged them differently.
When Quarenghi and I discussed your trip to America...
I had the distinct impression it would be an unofficial one.
There were more than 30 witnesses to that display of violence.
Some talked. The reporters at the trial had the story soon enough.
What seems important is the result.
A group of racists convicted on the testimony of a Negro priest.
Convicted not of arson, but of some minor infraction.
Disorderly conduct. That doesn't matter.
It's the first conviction of a white man in that part of the country... on the word of a Negro.
What is the price of victory in this skirmish?
You plunge the Vatican into controversy, which many of your leading prelates... have advised us to avoid.
They're only fooling themselves.
They must face up to it eventually.
Eventually, by all means.
A slow process of education.
In the meantime, kids without decent education now will die of old age... before you do anything to help them.
I didn't mean to involve the Church.
Now that it's happened,
I'm not sure it isn't a desirable thing.
Desirable for whom, Monsignor?
For your private causes or for the Holy Church?
Does your concept of desirability... include splitting Catholic opinion in America right down the middle?
Some of us feel, dear brother... that it is precisely a clear Vatican policy in these matters... that might prevent such a split.
We all have our own opinions, dear brother.
We can only place them before the Holy Father... and so discover which of them is correct.
What do you think, Alfeo?
Will the Pope feel I was indiscreet?
Well, your job was supposed to be consulting on American affairs... not hurling yourself into the thick of them.
I wouldn't recommend it as the ideal way to become a bishop.
If there was so much commotion here, he's probably heard about it already.
If not, you can be sure he will now.
And it won't be long after that before you know the result.
March 13, 1938.
Hitler enters Vienna... at 5:30 p.m., welcomed by enthusiastic crowds.
Cardinal Innitzer, Archbishop of Vienna, reads a letter signed by him... and all the other Austrian bishops, welcoming Hitler to Austria.
We acknowledge happily that the National Socialist movement has... for the German Reich and people... and especially for the underprivileged classes... achieved outstanding progress.
The bishops are extending their blessings and best wishes... for the future of these efforts.
On the day of the plebiscite, it is for us bishops... a natural, national obligation... to declare ourselves as Germans and as part of the German Reich.
We expect of all faithful Catholics... that they will know what they owe to their people.
That's enough!
You are familiar with Vienna, aren't you, Bishop Fermoyle?
Yes, I am, Your Eminence.
I'm going to ask the Holy Father to send you there immediately.
Your official function will be to shut down the nunciature.
And my unofficial function?
It will be an educational one.
Instructing a prince of the Church in the realities of the modern world.
The first thing we noticed on the screen, Your Eminence... was that all the church bells rang as Hitler entered Vienna.
You think they asked me for permission?
It's a standard courtesy to distinguished visitors.
We are great bell-ringers here.
But this visitor...
Dr. Seyss-lnquart ordered it as a friendly gesture.
He was Interim Chancellor and is now Hitler's High Commissioner.
A very devout Catholic. A war hero.
- Some tea?
- Thank you.
You understand
I'm not speaking for myself...
- but for the Holy See.
- Naturally.
Drop of rum in it?
- I don't think I'd...
- Just a taste.
- Sugar?
- Nothing, thank you.
What disturbed the Vatican most... was the declaration urging people to vote "Yes" in the plebiscite.
I understand.
You mustn't leave here without tasting this strudel.
I ordered it for you because I know... that you Americans are mostly interested in strudel... when you come to Vienna.
My only concern, of course, was the Church.
I've nothing to do with politics.
- That statement was non-political?
- Quite so.
On a vote whether Austria should become part of Germany?
Austria is part of Germany.
Hitler announced it.
The plebiscite is a mere formality.
A formality that Hitler himself seems to consider very important.
Precisely. Hitler wants Austria.
A great many Austrians want Hitler.
If the Church presides at the marriage, we'll get better treatment than if it didn't.
But you're doing more than presiding.
You've come out in favor of the union.
Rome feels the Church will be stronger in the long run... if we take a more critical stand toward National Socialism... than you have taken so far.
Does Rome have any idea how Hitler responds to criticism?
Would you like to see Catholic men and women scrubbing the sidewalks... like so many Jews?
There are principles we cannot compromise.
The rights of the Church over family life, education of our youth.
Your Excellency, what do you think
I'm doing here?
Protecting those very rights.
I have been given personal assurances from the very highest sources.
We have to remember what happened in Germany.
Austria is a different matter.
Don't forget this is a Catholic country.
It's the country where he himself was born and baptized.
- Nevertheless, the Vatican feels...
- You see, Fermoyle...
I know the people who've taken over here.
You'll meet some at Dr. Seyss-lnquart's reception tonight.
We have a civilized tradition in Austria that the Germans don't have.
Then why are people here so anxious to be annexed by them?
Because our blood is German.
It's hard for a non-German to understand.
Hardest of all for an American.
Why do you say that?
You are used to so much mixture.
The joining together of all German people is... what we have been dreaming of for 1,000 years.
The Germans and we are different in many ways, yes.
But our blood is the same.
I agree with Your Eminence that it's a hard concept to understand.
Then why waste our time trying?
Why don't you tell me, in brief, what it is the Holy Father expects of me?
First, he would like you to make it clear... that your recommendation to vote "Yes" was purely personal... not binding on Catholics as a matter of conscience.
And once that is done, to issue no further statements on the plebiscite.
Very simple instructions to obey.
I have no desire to make election statements.
I'm not a politician.
Your Eminence, Theodor Cardinal Innitzer and your Excellency, Bishop Fermoyle.
General Albrecht Kraus. Bishop Fermoyle.
Frau Walter, may I introduce you to Bishop Fermoyle?
Frau Clara Walter. Dr. Seyss-lnquart.
Your Eminence.
This is His Excellency Bishop Fermoyle.
An American who works in the Vatican.
I am honored.
I do hope you tell His Holiness how we esteem His Eminence here.
I spoke today on the telephone with the Führer.
And he said:
"All Austria must be at your command, my dear Seyss-lnquart...
"except Cardinal Innitzer."
He said, "Remember, your authority you have from me...
"his is from God."
Herr Kurt von Hartman and Frau Annemarie von Hartman.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
I finally did make my trip to America.
Kurt went on business two years ago and took me along.
But we never saw Boston.
I'm afraid most people don't.
How did you like what you did see?
Very much. Most of it.
There were things our people should have here to bring them into modern times.
Now, I think we will begin to get them.
Because of Hitler?
Annemarie finds merits in Mr. Hitler... not apparent to more detached observers.
But you don't agree?
As a banker,
I have to know some economics...
You have to go up about 1,500 meters to get good snow this late.
The Zugspitze.
St. Christopher above Adelberg...
This is getting to be a persecution complex.
Not to speak in front of Reinhard, who's been with us 12 years.
I believe the best rule is to make no exceptions.
The great danger about the Nazis,
I believe... is they must keep expanding or collapse.
Sooner or later this means war.
He says peace is the great dream of his life.
While he builds tanks and planes and surrounds himself with gangsters.
Some of them are crude, I know.
But I think we need their strength.
Now we have become part of a great, powerful country.
- Who could it be?
- I don't know.
Excuse me.
Gestapo!
Excuse me.
Kurt!
Do you know why he did it?
His grandmother on his father's side was Jewish.
The Nazis knew.
Apparently, he was half out of his mind with fear.
He couldn't decide whether to get out of the country or what.
He discussed all this with his lawyer, but he never told me.
- How would you have reacted?
- I'm not sure.
Perhaps he wasn't either.
It wasn't fair of him not to tell me.
How could I help him if I didn't know?
He must have been desperate.
You don't think what he did was right, do you?
Nothing ever can justify suicide.
But some cases are easier to understand.
The mental condition of people who feel persecuted becomes distorted... and nothing they do is understandable to the normal mind.
Your Eminence.
Forgive me for breaking in on you like this, but I was at the opera... and it occurred to me you'd want to read this at the earliest opportunity.
The correction you asked for of our statement on the plebiscite.
You'll probably want to send it on to the Vatican.
I think you'll find it covers all the points we discussed.
- When will this be published?
- Is Your Excellency joking?
The Nazis aren't going to let anything be printed that will lose them votes.
I suggest you have it read in every church in the country, Sunday morning.
That's the day of the plebiscite.
Won't many people go to Mass before they vote?
- It might cause disturbances.
- Then you reject the idea?
Unless I get a direct order from the Vatican. That, I'd naturally obey... even if I thought it was imprudent.
Good night, Bishop Fermoyle.
Don't bother to show me out.
I can see how busy you are.
We're getting the papers from Archbishop
Cicognani's regime ready for shipment.
Reminding me that we'll soon have no direct voice of Rome at our side.
Good night.
While His Eminence was here, this lady came.
I wouldn't have come here, but I didn't know where else to turn.
What's happening?
They are following me, the Gestapo.
I think they followed me here.
I don't know what they're after, but... if they take me to prison, they can make me say anything they want to, can't they?
With drugs and torture.
I don't think I could stand much pain.
- I don't know what to do, where to go.
- You can stay here.
Father Neidermoser?
Is Sister Wilhelmina still up?
- I believe so.
- Please ask her to come here.
You'll be safe with us.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. I'm glad I can be of help to you.
Thank you.
Come in.
- You sent for me, Your Excellency?
- Yes, Sister.
I want you to prepare a room for Frau von Hartman.
Certainly.
Sister Wilhelmina will see to it that you have everything you need.
Will you come with me,
Frau von Hartman?
Thank you again.
Your Eminence must have been among the first voters this morning.
The news was on the radio at 9:00.
I'm an earlier riser.
I like to say Mass at 6:00.
You advertised how you had voted.
I reported to you the Holy Father's concern for the...
My dear Bishop, you said I was to issue no more statements on the plebiscite.
Last night, at the end of Hitler's campaign speech, all the church bells rang again.
You just won't understand about the bells.
What would attract attention is not to ring them.
Radio reports say that priests all over the country are urging people to vote "Yes."
And the big news is that after you cast your vote...
My purely personal vote.
You gave the Nazi salute, Heil Hitler.
That is correct. The words have become a part of the German language.
They are used instead of "good morning" or "good evening"... even, I regret to say, instead of "God bless you."
Still, under the circumstances, that salute was a partisan political act.
I was not issuing a statement.
I have not disobeyed the Holy Father.
Literally, maybe not.
What I tried to convey to Your Eminence was a spirit, a general attitude.
To that you obviously paid no attention at all.
You deliberately decided that your way was better than the Holy Father's.
That's how I see it, and that's how I'll have to report it.
One moment, Bishop.
You must understand that I have no wish to pry into your personal life.
That was taken at Kurt von Hartman's funeral.
May I ask how Your Eminence happens to have come by this picture?
The police gave it to me.
I knew Frau von Hartman before she was married.
I was here at the time during a leave of absence from priesthood.
A leave of absence?
My vows naturally remained in force.
That was many years ago.
And right now, this very same woman is living with you at the nunciature?
She's staying with Sister Wilhelmina, the housekeeper.
I don't suggest there's anything improper about it.
But you must appreciate what the Nazis might make of it.
I granted Frau von Hartman sanctuary.
From the police, I know.
But does the fact that the police claim she has committed a crime... make the propaganda image any more favorable to the Church?
She has not committed a crime.
Nobody has charged her with anything.
I'd better bring you up to date on that.
There is clear evidence that Kurt von Hartman... for understandable reasons, was planning to leave Austria.
That may be true, but it hardly...
He wanted to take a large sum of money with him.
That's been against the law for years, long before the Nazis came.
This in no way involves his wife.
The fact that her personal jewelry was included.
Included in what?
Sewn, with the money, into the lining of a suitcase found in the apartment.
- I didn't know about that.
- She didn't tell you.
She told me that she knew nothing about her husband's plans.
And you accepted that.
I suppose it might even be true.
If it is, she should want the investigation to proceed so her name can be cleared.
Simply tell her to cooperate with the authorities.
- When the authorities are the Gestapo...
- I cannot have this scandal.
Not at a moment when I am completing... the most delicate negotiations for the future of the Church in Austria.
I have to think about it.
I have to talk to Frau von Hartman.
But you appreciate the importance of the problem and the urgency?
You'll find a way that won't embarrass me or my relations with the new government?
Yes, I will find a way.
They've just reported the totals of the plebiscite.
11,807 "No" votes.
4,443,208 "Yes" votes.
The percentage of "Yes" votes was 99.73.
Thank you, Father.
99 and 3/4 percent majority.
There's a soap in America that's advertised as 99.44 percent pure.
But Hitler has to be even purer.
- You'll close the nunciature.
- Austria doesn't exist anymore.
Our diplomatic relations are with Germany, with the nuncio in Berlin.
The Gestapo said they found a suitcase hidden in your apartment.
Jewelry of yours was sewn into the lining along with cash.
Kurt always kept my jewelry in his safe.
I'll find a way to get you out of the country.
You don't owe me anything, Stephen.
I owe you a great deal.
At a time when I'd forgotten how to love, you helped me to love again.
And you gave that love, not to me, but to God.
It was his to begin with, it was always his.
For me it was always you.
I never loved another man but you.
Excuse me, Your Excellency, telephone.
I want a Vatican witness along with me tonight.
Not only to keep the record straight, but it should be an educational experience.
I want you to report that a non-Roman can practice successful diplomacy.
- Where are we going?
- To see Adolf Hitler.
We've been waiting more than two hours.
Does the Führer know this?
- I'm sure he knows, Your Eminence.
- Thank you.
Two hours is a bit long, no matter how busy he is... but at least we should find him in a good mood.
Austria is his greatest triumph yet.
Cardinal Innitzer.
Not Bishop Fermoyle.
- The Führer wants to speak to you alone.
- But I specifically asked...
The Führer gave these orders.
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
You will tell people when you are home in America, about these days of glory... how you saw two German countries peacefully reunited.
I will tell people what I saw.
It will be the same when we free our German brothers... in the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia.
And also in your country.
- You're talking about the United States?
- Yes.
We have no wish to conquer your land or harm your people.
Our only purpose is to liberate the five million Germans there.
Your friend must have said something wrong.
He repudiated all his promises to me, every one of them.
There is going to be a war, he says.
The Church must be drafted into the service of the Fatherland... the same as the Army.
In Austria, there must be even more control than in Germany... because we have such a Catholic majority.
Our schools are to be abolished.
Our youth groups dissolved.
Catholic marriage will no longer have the force of law.
At the very end, he started yelling... and asked me if I didn't think
Almighty God... had chosen him to lead the German people to their destiny.
He didn't wait for an answer.
And I remembered myself at the plebiscite... raising my hand in a heathen salute... and saying not, "Praise to the Lord," but "Heil Hitler."
We could save the Blessed Sacrament.
It leads to the crypt under the cathedral.
Eminence!
Oh, no. It's only a scratch.
We must get you out of here.
With a Vatican passport, you are one of the few people who can leave the country.
At least for the moment. You must tell the truth about Hitler's promises.
You can't stay here, Your Eminence.
You're not safe.
Safety, I'm afraid, is among the illusions we can no longer depend on.
Pray for me.
Your Excellency, the most extraordinary thing...
Frau von Hartman.
The Gestapo came to question her. I told them they'd no right to enter the building.
- That it's the soil of a sovereign power.
- What happened?
Frau von Hartman went outside to meet them.
She didn't wish to claim the right of asylum here.
I begged her to wait till
Your Excellency returned, but...
She wouldn't?
Frau von Hartman said her character was barely strong enough... to do what she was doing right then.
It wouldn't hold up if she had to talk to you about it.
Open up!
I couldn't believe it, Your Excellency, when they told me who was here.
Why did you let them take you?
Because it suddenly seemed easier not to fight them.
It just didn't matter anymore.
It matters a lot.
We both know you're innocent.
Of one thing, to escape from Austria with money and jewels. I'm innocent of that.
And with the right help, you may prove it.
I have a lawyer coming to see you.
Is it worth so much effort? I wonder.
I've had time to think about myself since Kurt died.
When I was a spoiled girl,
I fell in love with a young man.
A priest.
I loved him. At least, I think I loved him.
But he was also a challenge to my vanity.
I wanted to take him away from his priesthood.
I wanted to take him away from God.
- You're not allowing us much time.
- No, let me speak please.
When I lost that campaign,
I was disappointed... and I turned to Kurt, which might have been all right... if I had been able to make myself, for him, the wife I used to dream about.
A woman who existed only for her man.
Poor Kurt.
He would have been satisfied with less, much less, but I gave him nothing.
- Annemarie...
- Let me finish.
Even when two people have very little to share... it is possible for them to make some sort of a life together.
Until one of them has a very strong need of the other.
When Kurt felt such a need, there was nowhere for him to turn.
He loved me too much to leave the country without me... and he couldn't be sure enough of me to tell me about his plan.
I can imagine what he felt... when he heard my foolish talk about the new Greater Germany.
Because of that alone, it serves me right that I'm here now.
Do you think Kurt would feel that way?
No.
He was too kind.
He would not want to see me hurt.
Then that's one reason to try to clear yourself, for his sake.
Also for mine, because I care what happens to you.
Thank you. I wish I did.
Let's wrap it up! Your time is up.
You have to. The most important reason of all is for your own sake.
Because of what you are.
Not an ant in a totalitarian anthill... but a human being, an individual... with a God-given soul of your own.
Come.
Thank you, Your Excellency.
And goodbye.
I have the honor to inform
Your Eminence... that the Holy Father will confer the cardinal's biretta... at the semipublic consistory in the Apostolic Palace of the Vatican...
Thursday morning, at 10:00.
Thank you.
My friends... dear brethren in Christ... my mother... and the other members of my family, who have traveled so far for this occasion.
I thank you all for being here.
And I know you share my gratitude to the Holy Father... for the honor he has done to me and to America.
When His Holiness informed me that he intended to name me... to the Sacred College of Cardinals... my first reaction was that
I could not live up to his confidence in me.
I haven't gotten over that fear yet.
I doubt that I ever will.
But the second thought I had about it gave me the strength to try.
What occurred to me was that there is a special significance... in the Holy Father's decision to send me back to my own country... as a cardinal and archbishop... at this moment of global crisis.
America's first bishop, John Carroll... was the brother of a signer of the Declaration of Independence... and a living example... of that loyalty to church and state... to religion and to democracy... that this moment in history demands from us all.
I have seen at close range... the hell on earth that awaits us all if totalitarianism prevails.
If the world forgets that all men alike are the children of God... endowed by their Creator... with the unalienable right... to life... liberty... and the pursuit of happiness.
That is America's creed.
That is the Gospel of the Church.
It is in danger, at this moment, from men... and doctrines that are the enemies of all freedoms... political, as well as religious.
The defense of freedom calls for strong voices... strong hearts... strong hands.
Pray for me, that I may not falter... and for the liberty and exaltation of our church... and our beloved country.
God bless you.
Why? How could it happen?
Another 100 metres and the Americans would have captured the Oberkassel Bridge.
It was the only escape route for our units in that sector.
Escape route?
No. A highway for the American Army into the heart of Germany.
In any case, the Führer is determined we shall not take such a risk again.
Not very likely.
There's only one bridge left.
And already it is threatened by the American forces.
One breakthrough, a few hours, and it too can be lost.
General von Brock, you must prepare to destroy the Remagen
Bridge at the earliest possible moment.
Destroy?
We have 75,000 men who would be trapped on the other side of the Rhine.
And if the bridge falls to the enemy, are you prepared for the consequences?
These men are all that's left of the 15th Army.
Their only hope of salvation is that bridge.
The 15th Army will stand or die.
The Führer has ordered that not one foot of our sacred soil will be yielded to the enemy.
Herr Feldmarschall, if orders won wars, we wouldn't now be fighting with our backs against the Rhine.
We'd be dancing at the London Savoy.
I suggest you speak more carefully,
Herr General.
You might be misunderstood.
These are your written orders.
In the present conditions
I must require your countersignature.
Quite clear, Herr Feldmarschall.
I'm to destroy Remagen Bridge at the earliest possible moment.
Good night, gentlemen.
I am sorry the war has disturbed your sleep.
What a brilliant plan to shorten the war.
Do just what the enemy wants.
Just got word from G2.
At least 50,000 Germans are still here, on this side of the Rhine, starting to move toward the bridge at Remagen, but we're gonna cut 'em off.
- Who's out front now, Colonel Dent?
- 27th Armoured Infantry, sir.
- You again, eh, Barnes?
- Somebody has to be up there, sir.
All right, now, listen to me.
I want those Germans.
I want an armoured recon outfit to make an all-out run for the river, see what kind of resistance we're gonna find.
That's Indian country out there.
Loose German units everywhere.
But I don't want any tippytoe tactics.
We've gotta move fast.
Sir, the men are dead on their feet.
So are the Germans, sir.
If you don't mind my saying so, sir.
- Do you think you can do it?
- I know we can, sir.
It's our only chance to grab the 15th Army before it reaches the Remagen Bridge and hightails it across the Rhine.
Be nice if that bridge'd be in one piece when we got there.
Forget bridges. If the Germans haven't blown them, our airforce will. Get going.
You're spearhead.
Strike for Stadt Meckenheim tonight.
If you hit trouble, holler. With luck, we may reach the Rhine tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
We're spearhead again, Johnny.
- Jesus.
- Well, it's orders.
Got a light, Major?
You don't want the Russkies to beat us to Berlin, do you?
Think I should care?
Our mission is to get to the river.
Next stop Stadt Meckenheim by tonight.
So, give 'em hell, do you hear?
Keep sharp. You're the cuttin' edge.
- Hey, Pattison, come here!
- Hold it.
- We're on the move. Where's Hartman?
- Still up ahead, sir. Riding point.
OK. Let's go.
You know something, Angel? You're a pig.
I love you too... sir.
Everybody makes a profit out of the war.
Why shouldn't I?
Know your trouble, Lieutenant?
You got no ambition.
I'm goin' out of this war rich.
Or dead, Angel.
You may be dead.
If I do get it, I got a present for you.
Might help you get into heaven.
Who'd you steal that off?
- My mother.
- You're a pig.
Why don't you get off my back?
- Hello, John.
- Any casualties, Phil?
We hit 'em too fast.
Look, we've got a new mission.
Stadt Meckenheim by nightfall.
Barnes volunteering us for action again?
Look, will you forget Barnes?
Brass gives the orders.
And Barnes jumps in and picks 'em up like some dog picks up a bone.
"Sir, there's nothin' my boys like better..."
Just knock it off, Phil.
OK, John.
- Angel!
- Yes, sir.
- Pack up. We're movin' out.
- Where to?
Toward the enemy.
We're movin' out!
John...
Look, you gonna ride point, or do you want me to take it?
I am.
Move it!
- There you go.
- 38 bucks.
27 jewels. Swiss movement.
Best German watch you can buy.
- Payday, Angel?
- Payday, hell. Now.
Christ, Angel, I'm gonna be here.
What are you askin' for the ten-dollar watch?
Hey, Lieutenant, I hear we're gettin' a three-day pass.
Not funny, Slavek.
- I thought I'd take up photog...
- Clean it.
You snafu like that again,
Bissell, your ass is mine.
Let's go, Grebs.
Mount up.
- Get that truck into line there.
- We're movin' out!
Major Kreuger. This way, please.
One moment, please.
Herr Major.
Paul, I'm glad you could come. Sit down.
- You're looking well.
- Feeling much better.
- I had no idea you were in the hospital.
- That is unimportant.
- No, thank you.
- I signed my own discharge.
Why such a hurry? No pretty nurses?
Oh, yes. Yes.
But there was too much bad news.
You've had your share.
It was a blow to learn
General von Kreuger was killed in action.
He was a great soldier, your father.
Have you been home?
Not yet.
At this time, I think it's better that one should be doing something.
- I hear the Russians are at the Elbe.
- Yes.
- And here?
- Worse. Utter confusion.
Every day I get orders to attack with divisions that no longer exist.
Hitler still thinks he's winning the war.
The army helped bring Hitler into power.
Are you saying we made a mistake?
I'll show you something.
Here, the 15th Army, or what's left of it.
75,000 men trapped.
Here, Remagen Bridge - the only way to get them out.
And what are my orders? Blow it up.
What in God's name can I do?
One can only do one's duty.
What's that?
Delay. Try and save the army.
Hold the bridge as long as possible.
Are you suggesting I disobey an order?
If I put you in command of that bridge, would you hold it open as long as possible?
What are the defences?
One regular company, a reserve company, 600 volunteers,
200 Hitler Youth, an anti-aircraft unit.
About 1600 men, all told, fully equipped.
That is good. Where are the Americans?
Around Bonn.
What if they threaten Remagen?
I managed to hold two panzer battalions in reserve.
When shall I take command?
Be at the bridge by morning.
You understand that in the circumstances
I cannot give you a written order.
But I do promise you my full support.
From you, sir, that's quite enough.
What's wrong? Why'd you stop?
It's too easy. No mines. No roadblocks.
They don't have time. They're pullin' out.
The whole German Army's on the run.
Maybe they're not pulling out here.
You're gonna stop at every lousy bend in the road?
I don't know.
I'll tell you when I come to them.
Why the hell don't you admit it?
You don't like riding point.
I don't like riding point.
All right, I'm gonna ride point.
Just you keep up tight behind me.
Depends how fast you're going.
Well, come on. Let's go.
Hold it, you guys. Stay in your trucks.
Grebs! Get that Kraut car up here!
Yes, sir.
- What do you think it was, a mine?
- Anti-tank shell.
Take your half-track.
Cut across that field to the farmhouse.
When you hear these go off, come in fast.
Load her up. We're movin' out.
The rest of you stay back.
- What have they got in that farmhouse?
- I don't know, Grebs, but it ain't candy.
Easy, Grebs, normal speed.
If they spot our uniforms now, it's goodbye, Nancy.
- I think they've seen us, sir.
- Give it everything you got. Go. Go!
Closer! Get in closer!
Flush 'em out!
- Jellicoe.
- Yeah?
- Think we oughta check the barn.
- I think you're right, Angel.
What's the matter, Glover?
Nothing, sir. I, uh...
Just for a minute there, I was awful tired.
Sometimes it hits you like that.
Yes, sir.
It's Captain Colt, sir.
I couldn't leave him in the road.
Well...
What was all that about, Lieutenant?
Target practice, sir.
Gotta keep sharp.
We're the cutting edge.
How'd Johnny get it?
Anti-tank shell.
He was tryin' too hard, or he was pushed too hard.
What the hell do you mean by that?
He was tired. He got careless.
We're all pushed too hard. We're all tired.
Not as tired as he was.
Well, I guess this makes you commandin' officer of company A.
You take over from Johnny.
- Why me?
- Because you're available, that's why.
- Why not Pattison?
- He's too green.
Look, Hartman...
I know it's been a hard blow.
It's always a shock to lose a buddy, a man you fought with. We're all human.
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is
I realise Captain Colt was your friend.
He was my friend too.
Bullshit.
Would you care to rephrase that, Lieutenant?
You don't have any friends out here, Major.
Neither do I.
We can't afford 'em, either one of us.
What in the name of God is goin' on?
What kind of outfit is this?
The men are tired, Major.
They're blowing off steam.
OK.
I'm company CO. What are my orders?
We're punching our way through to the Rhine at top speed.
German lines are fluid this side of the river.
I want you in
Stadt Meckenheim by tonight.
And you can tell your men I'll give them leave as soon as they hit the river.
How do you know Stadt Meckenheim isn't crawling with Germans?
- What if they unload on us?
- Then we'll know, won't we, Lieutenant?
Angel!
Angel, we're movin' out!
- Chicken dinner.
- Move it.
Just havin' a little recreation, sir.
Didn't you forget something, Sergeant?
Yeah, well, I checked them all out.
Nothing worth much. Except this.
Let's go, Grebs.
- Wilhelm, what's holding us up?
- It's a checkpoint ahead, Herr Major.
Stillgestanden. Zur Salve.
Legt an.
Gebt... feuer!
Your papers?
Where are you going?
Remagen. General von Brock's orders.
- What was the meaning of that?
- To set an example.
Maybe other officers will stay at their posts.
Better to die facing the enemy... than the firing squad.
You may go on. Heil Hitler.
Wilhelm, cigarette?
Thank you, Herr Major.
It's not good, Herr Major.
When we do such things, shoot our own officers by the road, then I think the war is lost.
- Is this Meckenheim?
- Yeah.
What do you think?
We'll split up.
You go in from the right, across the field.
I'll go straight down the road.
We'll meet at the church.
I don't see any white flags.
You think they're friendly?
Let's sit tight until the patrol comes in.
What a way to fight a war. The goddamn conquering army sleeping in the streets, the Krauts nice and warm in their beds.
All clear, Angel. Secure the town.
Bed down the rest of the men.
Send a signal to Major Barnes with...
Murrie!
Send a signal to Major Barnes with the main column.
"Entered Meckenheim, 2300.
No - repeat no - resistance."
"Await further orders. Hartman."
Where do I bed the men down?
In the half-tracks?
Speak to Pattison. He found someplace.
- Hotel?
- Yeah, first class.
Jesus Christ, it's a goddamn jail.
- I want my lawyer.
- Home sweet home.
- Where's the can?
- Use your boot.
Oh, man. Real showers.
- It's even got a bed in it.
- I think that's mine.
Move it. That's my bunk.
All right, boys, find a spot and sack out.
They're rotten, these mattresses.
I've seen better accommodations in a zoo.
Clear the way. Come on, make room, boys. Make room.
- You never saw a girl before?
- Not like that.
She's fine.
- Get out.
- What?
- Out.
- You're joking.
What do you want? Get her for yourself?
- You don't understand.
- Get out! Move it!
- I love her.
- Move it!
They scared you, huh?
You don't have anything to worry about.
I wouldn't let one of those guys lay a glove on you.
Understand?
Would you like to sit down?
Listen, everything's gonna be all right.
I'll be nice to you.
I swear to God.
You hungry?
Chocolate.
Real.
What's going on?
Who brought her in here?
She was here all the time, for Christ's sakes.
What are you doing here?
- Warum sind Sie hier?
- The Germans arrested me. I am French.
- I thought you didn't speak English.
- Go on, get outta here. Get out.
You're a bastard, sir.
If there's not enough for everybody, there sure as hell ain't enough for you.
If I see her in here again,
I'll break your neck.
Lieutenant, she went that way.
What are you gonna do with all your money, Slavek?
Buy me the biggest whorehouse in Texas, then lock the door and retire.
The bastard's already got over $1200 in markers from all us poor people.
Deducting, of course, what I owe you, Lieutenant.
- I'm going to sleep.
- Lieutenant.
This belonged to Captain Colt, sir, and being as you're acting CO, I guess you'll be the man who'll write the letter.
- Well, he sure was a first-class...
- Yeah.
- What I mean is, sir, all the men...
- Can it, soldier.
Cold bastard, ain't he?
What is it you owe me, Slavek?
Well, that's all you're worth to me, Slavek.
$78.50, not a damn bit more.
And in future, you watch your mouth.
All right, let's play cards.
I thought I kicked you out.
I've nowhere to go.
How'd you get here?
I'll sleep with you.
Do you have cigarettes?
Help yourself.
I lived with a German.
He was killed in the Ardennes.
Before that, I went to a convent school.
They didn't teach you this in the convent.
Privileges of rank, eh, Lieutenant?
What do you want?
Signal from Barnes at battalion headquarters.
Tough, huh?
Get the men up. We're moving out.
Those men are tired. They'll kill us.
They're so happy we found no Germans, they want us to keep going till we do.
Where might that be?
Captain Schmidt,
Remagen Bridge Security Command.
- Major Kreuger.
- Thank God you have come.
- Headquarters said you were on the way.
- I must use your phone.
Yes, this is Major Kreuger. Get me
General von Brock at headquarters.
Yes, it's urgent.
- What's the last report on the Americans?
- Still in Stadt Meckenheim.
Good. Perhaps they'll head towards Bonn. Thank you.
At least it'll give us a little time to prepare our defences.
Captain Schmidt...
Oh, excuse me, Herr Major.
You must do something about the civilian traffic. We can't get our work done.
This is Captain Baumann,
Chief Engineering Officer. Major Kreuger.
I'm glad you're here. If we don't clear the bridge, we'll never be ready to blow it.
The most immediate problem is not to blow the bridge up but to keep it open.
Excuse me, but is it not true the Führer has ordered the bridge destroyed?
Does the Führer transmit his orders directly to you, or are you simply spreading idle gossip?
But I understood...
At this moment, Baumann, a loose tongue is our most dangerous enemy.
Surely you know the penalty for spreading defeatist rumours?
Please sit down, Captain Schmidt.
Baumann, you stay.
Will you brief me on the condition of all of the units at our disposal?
The regular company, is it fit for instant duty?
But there is no regular company.
I don't understand.
It's been transferred.
Oh.
The reserve company, is it fully equipped?
It no longer exists.
And the 600 Polish and Russian volunteers, can we count on them?
The so-called volunteers have vanished.
Captain Schmidt, on paper at least, you have some 1600 men.
How many, in fact, do you have?
About... 200.
Including the bridge detail.
And the 400 militia, the Volkssturm, the Hitler Youth?
A handful.
- Where are the others?
- Deserted.
Herr Hauptmann, do you realise what you are saying is treason?
No, Herr Major. Only the truth.
Yes?
General von Brock is temporarily unavailable.
This is Major Kreuger. You will convey this message to the general.
It is imperative that he send two panzer battalions at once.
So, Captain Baumann,
I trust that in the event of an emergency at least the explosives are in place to blow up the bridge?
Not yet, Herr Major. It is reported that 600 kilos of high explosives are on the way.
But perhaps that, too, is only a rumour.
- Captain Schmidt.
- Major?
Those towers will give us an excellent field of fire on the bridge.
- What is in them?
- Two heavy machine guns on each side.
That old barge, it will be very useful.
- We'll put weapons on it.
- Yes, Herr Major.
Come. Show me your defences.
With only 36 men, sir, there's a limit to what we can do.
Sergeant Becker, I'm not asking you to launch a major offensive.
I'm only asking that you hold off the enemy until reinforcements arrive.
Excuse me, Herr Major. We have heard a lot about reinforcements.
The men don't believe it any more.
I tell you, two panzer battalions will be here in a few hours.
Do you believe me?
Yes, Herr Major.
Then you make your men believe it.
Do you understand?
That's the road the enemy tanks will have to take.
The approaches to the bridge, are they mined?
Heavily mined, Herr Major. Ready to blow.
No enemy tank will reach the bridge.
For the moment, these are the heaviest defences we have against the enemy.
- A great deal depends on you.
- Yes, Herr Major.
Good.
Our best shelter - a whole mountain above us.
First-class gun position.
Get a crew to strengthen these gun emplacements.
Herr Major, still no answer from General von Brock.
Keep trying. What is this?
The master switch to destroy the bridge, when we have the explosives.
And the detonating circuit, what if it fails?
Herr Major.
Nine-centimetre cable. Heavy steel pipe.
- The circuit is tested every hour.
- What if it fails?
An emergency fuse can be lit by hand, over there, by the rail.
If we have the explosives.
I know, Captain Schmidt. I know.
I'll go to the town to see about civil defence.
You, cut up some bedsheets.
I want a flag for every window.
Rudi, check the wine cellar.
Do as Herr Holzgang says.
Greta, get a broom.
Sweep up the glass.
Oh, my God.
Didn't I tell you to pack these things away?
Pay no attention. Find the glue.
- At least we can try to...
- (knock on door)
Go away! We are closed!
What are you doing?
This is private property.
- You are Councillor Holzgang?
- Of course.
- In charge of civil defence?
- Yes.
I am Major Kreuger, new military commander at Remagen.
It's charming.
It is always good to meet someone who appreciates beautiful things.
- It must be very valuable.
- Irreplaceable.
- At least 1500 Reichsmarks.
- Really? That much?
Herr Holzgang, half of your town has been blown apart.
Remagen may be under direct attack by nightfall.
It is your duty to gather every able-bodied man to defend your town.
- But there's hardly anyone left.
- Find them.
The time has come, Herr Holzgang, for you too to make a small sacrifice.
Excuse me, Herr Major.
And what is that?
My only son. Killed at Stalingrad.
What greater sacrifice can a man make?
None, except the sacrifice made by your son.
Bring me some schnapps, and cigarettes.
Herr Holzgang, the sheets are ready.
Greta, quick, bring it.
What are you trying to do, get me shot?
That's a military commander, you fool.
- You are Frau Holzgang?
- Yes.
You have other children?
No.
You must be very proud of your son.
Is that what I'm supposed to be?
Proud that he's dead?
No.
I'm not proud at all.
I miss him.
Germany has lost four million sons.
I pity them, but I pity most my own son.
We must learn to live with our losses.
Even your husband.
Put this on the army circuit. I want the command post at the bridge at once.
Sergeant Becker? This is Major Kreuger.
He's dead, Major.
This is Major Kreuger.
Ja, ja.
Herr General, the Americans are attacking the ridge above the town.
We have no forces to hold them.
Where are the panzers?
Why elsewhere? They were promised here. This is where they are needed.
Herr General, your regrets will not save the bridge, but two panzer battalions might.
Spread out!
Come on, move out! Let's go!
Glover, get down.
Son of a bitch.
- Well, I'll be damned.
- Grebs, get Major Barnes.
Yes, sir.
- You got your camera with you, Glover?
- No, sir, I sold it back to Sergeant Angelo.
When the Krauts blow that bridge, it's gonna be some picture.
We got 'em.
We got 'em.
Hey, yeah, you. Get me headquarters.
Tell artillery to lay on the heavy stuff.
Get tanks up here fast. Start shelling the bridge. You got it? Move!
Yes, sir.
If you wait a minute, the Krauts'll probably save you the trouble.
Don't matter a damn.
Push 'em along, push 'em along.
OK, OK, Hartman, get on down there.
We'll send in tanks for support.
The quicker you boys get down there and blow the bridge, the quicker we got maybe six enemy divisions corked and bottled.
Hartman, boy, you do that for me,
I promise you a unit citation.
Major, sir, there's nothing my boys would appreciate more, sir.
All right, boys. Get goin'.
Move!
Captain Schmidt, transfer this command post to the tunnel at once.
Commandeer every able-bodied soldier.
Commandeer?
What about our reinforcements?
- They were sent elsewhere.
- Von Brock promised...
They were sent elsewhere.
- And the explosives?
- I gave you an order.
Yes, Herr Major.
Ja?
Herr Major, the explosives have arrived.
We are placing the charges.
- Have you enough men?
- Yes, Herr Major.
Good.
- The explosives?
- They are here.
Thank God.
Herr Hauptmann!
Sergeant, double the amount.
Crucial points only.
- Double amount. Crucial points only.
- (artillery fire)
Are you ready, Corporal?
- All ready, Herr Major.
- Get machine guns. Man those towers.
- Yes, Herr Major.
- You.
The white flags are out, Herr Holzgang.
Anything else?
Yes. Pray.
Come, into the cellar.
Greta, come on!
Come on, quickly.
- Column of twos. Get 'em outta here.
- Grebs! Jellicoe!
Come on, move.
Come on.
Come on. You can rob him later.
Come on, damn it. Move.
Line up over here.
You, come here.
Surrender, huh? Surrender.
Please, we are unarmed civilians.
We have done nothing.
Who was the boy upstairs who killed one of my men?
- Your hotel covered with surrender flags.
- Who was that boy? Who was he?
- Rudi. Where is he?
- He's dead.
- I ordered him not to resist.
- You're a dirty, lyin' bastard.
If you ordered him not to resist, how come he resisted?
But how could I stop him?
They were trained to kill.
Hitler made animals of them.
So you hate Hitler, huh?
A tragedy for Germany.
But we were helpless.
I hate this terrible war.
I'm a man of peace.
I'm an innkeeper.
Good. When they blow the bridge, my men'll be back, and they're used to the very best.
Anything you wish.
We will cooperate in every way.
Listen, if you're so anxious to show us how much you hate this terrible war...
Come here. Come here.
Come here.
Yes, sir.
File this among your souvenirs.
Come on.
Blow the approach to the bridge,
Herr Major!
Enemy tanks are at the river.
Keep the bridge open!
The munitions train is coming across.
Five minutes, Herr Major.
Give me five minutes.
We don't have one minute.
Prepare to fire the ramp charge.
- Wait!
- Fire!
Everyone to the tunnel.
Get into the tunnel.
Good to see you, sir. I think you've arrived just in time for the kill.
- Tell the tanks to cease fire!
- Sir?
Stop all artillery.
Tell 'em to hit the far side with smoke.
Yes, sir.
Barnes, where's your lead unit?
They're right on the bridge approach, sir.
We're not gonna blow that bridge, Barnes.
We're gonna take it.
Take it?
As long as it's still standing, we've got a chance. Cut every wire and cable.
Dent, alert HQ. Ask them to give us every available unit on the double.
I'd hate to think of our men in the middle of the bridge when they blow it.
It's a crapshoot, Major.
Take that bridge and we shorten the war.
We're risking 100 men, but we may save 10,000, even 50,000.
It's your chance to make history, Major.
What you've gotta do is throw your men across. Now, Major.
Yes, sir.
Give the order, Schmidt.
If you are afraid to act, I am not.
Prepare to fire.
No! Wait!
I think he's hurt.
Blow, you son of a bitch. Blow!
Relax. 20 minutes from now there ain't gonna be nothing out there but water.
- How about 15?
- How about 30?
Now, now, boys.
This here calls for a pool.
What do you say?
Ten bucks each, winner takes all.
- You're on.
- Name it.
- 30 minutes.
I'll take a piece of that action at 20 minutes.
Hartman, I gotta talk to you.
There's been a change of signals.
Well, get down here.
- Yes, sir?
- We gotta take the bridge.
- Who says?
- Shinner.
- He's crazy. They're gonna blow it.
- No, not if we rush it, cut all the cables.
Let 'em blow it.
That's not a bridge - it's a deathtrap.
We are wasting time, Hartman.
I got time to waste.
What makes that bridge so goddamn valuable?
- If we take it, maybe it'll shorten the war.
- Maybe?
Dying's a lot more definite than that.
So I've heard. Now, would you move it, get your men out there.
Why don't you "maybe" boys take on some of the dirty chores?
Why don't you take us across, Barnes?
Because I'm orderin' you!
Now, get going.
Hartman, that is an order.
Move.
That's a court martial for you, Sergeant.
You're dead.
You goddamn idiot. Do you think we ever had any choice? Come on.
- Come on.
- No!
You want me, you know where to find me.
Come on! Come on, let's go. Come on.
We're not giving them enough cover!
Hit the bridge with more smoke!
16th Field Artillery.
More smoke, more smoke!
Hold your fire!
Give the order, Herr Major!
For God's sake, give the order to blow!
We are about to explode the bridge.
I want everyone to lie down, open your mouths and cover your ears.
Cease fire!
Take cover!
Fire!
Fire!
The cable is broken.
A shell hit.
The emergency charge. At once!
- Send a man to light the fuse.
- If he can get to it.
- Where is it?
- I can show him, Herr Major.
Well, keep to the right side of the bridge.
Give covering fire to the left!
Fire only to the left!
They're blowing the bridge!
Get outta there!
Somebody lit the fuse! It's gonna blow!
Come on. Come on!
Get outta here! Come on!
Come on!
Angel.
Come on! Come on, get back!
It's gonna blow!
Come on, back!
We're alive.
They blew it, and we're alive.
Jesus loves me.
The army promised us first-grade military explosives.
Look. Donarit - cheap industrial explosives.
Get me General von Brock at headquarters.
It's these damned Poles.
We should kill them all.
Herr Leutnant,
I must give you one more order.
Get to General von Brock at any cost.
Tell him to bomb the bridge at once, and send reinforcements before morning.
- Otherwise...
- Yes, Herr Major.
He'll never get through.
Move forward!
Spread out! Keep moving!
It's not much of a bridgehead. Don't you think we oughta spread out a little?
With what? We don't even have enough men to hold what we've got.
- We'd better do something.
- Sure.
Sit here and pray Barnes sends help across in a hurry.
Medic!
We'll never fill up this goddamn hole.
Like hell we won't.
I'll put tanks across here by morning.
- They're back on the river.
- Must be the barge.
You stay here, Pattison.
You're in charge of the bridgehead.
- Where we goin'?
- You stay with him, Grebs.
What now?
Move out there and attack.
The Americans will have tanks across the bridge before daylight.
It's a farce! Where are the bombers?
Our reinforcements?
The most important place in Germany, and what do we have to fight with?
Old men, riffraff, the sweepings from the road.
And you, Baumann, will you fight as hard as you talk?
You will find out when we attack.
Tell Captain Schmidt to assemble the men.
Hartman!
Hartman!
Hartman!
- Schmidt. Where are the others?
- Gone, Herr Major.
- Where?
- God knows.
Tell the truth. They ran away, the cowards. If only you had...
All right, quiet.
Where are your weapons?
- You! Arm them.
- Yes, Herr Major.
Come on.
Herr Major, 27 men, three officers.
- What can we do?
- Fight.
The enemy doesn't know how many we are.
Listen, all of you.
We will divide into two squads.
Captain Schmidt will lead one and I the other.
I want every man to draw as much ammunition as he can carry.
Check your weapons and stand by.
Halt.
Halt!
Why?
They say that dying animals bite at their own wounds.
Now we are killing our own people.
Come.
- We must attack.
- It is useless.
These men are not going to die for nothing.
You just killed two men.
Are you going to try to kill us all?
- It is our duty.
- Your duty and mine is to these people.
Stop!
You will not attack?
We cannot.
Then I ask of you one thing.
Hold out till the last possible moment.
Give me a chance to get to headquarters and get reinforcements.
I'll do my best, Herr Major.
Lieutenant.
He's dead, sir.
Where're the guys?
Gone.
All?
Heil Hitler. Your papers, please.
Follow me.
I want to see
General von Brock immediately.
Impossible. He cannot be disturbed.
What do you want?
Wake him. And get on your feet when you speak to me.
But, Herr Major...
I'm Gerlach. And who are you?
Major Kreuger.
I've just come from Remagen.
- Come in.
- The Americans have taken the bridge.
I must report to General von Brock...
We've just been discussing the situation at Remagen with General von Brock.
I've been sent here by the Führer to learn the facts.
I'm sure you can help explain.
It's very simple. We did not have enough explosives to blow up the bridge.
Is that your excuse, Herr Major?
There is never enough for you cowards, is there?
The truth is you waited too long.
We must counterattack, blow up the bridge at once.
Any further delay will be fatal.
It's no use, Paul.
There's nothing we can do any longer.
Major Kreuger, you will address your remarks to me.
General von Brock has been relieved of his command.
And you, Herr Major, the bridge at Remagen is no longer your concern.
You are under arrest.
What's the matter with those guys back there?
What are they waiting on, a bus?
Where's Barnes, for Christ's sake?
Good old Barnes.
Take a count, Grebs.
Hey, Lieutenant, you OK?
Take a count.
All right, you guys. Sound off.
- Jenkins!
- Hawks!
- Montano!
- Vorkapich!
Julius!
- Engel!
- Gebhardt!
Savage!
Sir, they're comin' across.
Let's go, Grebs.
It's time to move out.
Jesus, Lieutenant, we got tanks comin'.
Hartman, get down, you crazy bastard!
Hartman!
Hartman!
All right, you guys, give him cover fire!
Captain Schmidt,
Remagen Bridge Security Command.
I offer you a surrender.
Herr Leutnant?
Bring your men out, hands on their heads.
No funny business.
You will have no trouble.
Los! Rauskommen alle!
Rauskommen! Los!
Hold it there. OK, move on.
Was soll aus uns werden?
Nichts. Du gehst jetzt nach Hause.
I told him to go home, nothing would happen.
He asked me because in peacetime
I am the schoolmaster here in Remagen.
There's not much left, is there?
That was a damn fool walk you just made, Lieutenant.
I'm movin' you and your men back for a rest. You deserve it.
And, uh...
I'm forgetting about what happened back there, do ya understand?
I feel the army and the whole country owes you all thanks and a unit citation.
And you know somethin'? You'll have somethin' to tell your grandchildren...
Hartman!
Hey, Hartman!
You're slowin' down.
I thought you'd be in Berlin by now.
Angel!
Angel!
Where'd you get that uniform?
Look here,
I got some German marks and, uh...
What is this?
That looks like a three-day pass.
I think I'll join the Germans.
Hold it. Hold it, now.
- You've got a wounded man here.
- I'll get you the Silver Star.
- At least the Congressional Medal.
- Anything you want.
- I'd like a cigar.
- Don't have that. Got a cigarette.
Oh, hold it, now.
Not yet, you bastard. Wait till I'm dead.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil.
- Übernimm die Einzelheiten.
- Zu Befehl.
Herr Major, I regret very much.
Ours or theirs?
Enemy planes, sir.
But who is the enemy?
Zur Salve.
Legt an.
Gebt... feuer!
Excuse me, Herr Leutnant.
May I ask - where did you get that?
From a friend.
Let's go.

There are a total of thirty-six gates into Edo Castle.
Eighteen of these cross the Outer Moat.
The other eighteen cross the Inner Moat.
In essence, they are the bottlenecks that control access to the Castle.
The Daimyo enter the Castle through one of the gates, usually the one closest to their Edo mansions.
Thus, each Daimyo has chosen one entrance as his favorite.
The Lord of the Hikone Domain, and
Great Elder of the shogunate
"Kamonnokami"
Naosuke, always enters through the Sakurada Gate.
A hemp symbol in a circle?
That's Sir Satake lzuminokami from Nihonmatsu in Ooshu.
Sir Satake of Nihonmatsu in
Oshu? I see.
Well, it's almost 8:30. The entourages using the Sakurada Gate should...
Yes, sir. That's about it for now.
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.
It's cold this morning.
Thank you.
Well, Edo Castle blanketed in snow is a sight to see.
Besides, for unemployed ronin like us, the opportunity to witness the Daimyo processions is a true delight.
I hope that your wish to become an officer will come true soon.
Today, li Naosuke did not arrive at the Castle
By command of Commander
Hoshino Kenmotsu, we retreat from the Sakurada
Gate for the time being.
It is the morning of February 17th,
1860. Nine in the morning.
The 32 men who retreated from the Sakurada Gate gather at Sagamiya, in Shinagawa.
Sagamiya is a large teahouse suitable for meetings and is listed in the "Edo Illustrated
Map of Famous Places."
Today is February 17th.
It's our understanding that the shogun's household and the high officials, will be holding a "Ongusoku lwai no Gi" armor ceremony before shogun lemochi's excursion to the countryside.
Great Elder li Naosuke had no reason not to show up at the Castle!
Our plan was... elaborately developed, with the utmost care, so that it would be top secret.
As such... it is unthinkable that there was an accidental disclosure that would allow the House of li to learn of our intentions!
There must be a traitor among us.
It's the only explanation that I can think of.
We have been infiltrated by someone working for the House of li.

It is 11 in the morning.
The meeting at Sagamiya ends.
Three men choose to remain.
So, it seems that there's a traitor in our midst.
Don't worry. It's nothing but the
Chief's absurd speculation.
Don't you worry. I have faith in us.
I have more faith in your Jigen-lchi
Style, Sir Tsuru than I do in our leader's maneuverings.
Right. Without any solid evidence, he's already talking about a "traitor!"
We're supposed to be comrades, our lives all pledged to the same cause.
Thank you very much.
Come back again!
Please come again.
Sir, the baggage. Here you go, sir.
What's wrong?
I apologize for the disarray, sir.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
- May I ask who you are?
- Sir, I may not look like it, but...
...thanks to our generous patrons,
I am the manager of Sagamiya.
What do they call you?
Your name.
Sir, my name is Okiku.
There's no doubt that he's a ronin, originally from Bishu?
Well, at least that's what he claims.
Nobody has confirmed it yet.
So, he lives in a mud hut by the Kamakura riverbed works as a bouncer... a hired body- guard, and extorts and blackmails?
He's a ruffian, indeed!
Yes, sir.
Perhaps I got carried away about increasing our manpower.
Seems I've hired someone we ought to suspect.
Niiro isn't the only man we ought to watch. There's another suspect.
Nobody important. One
Kurihara Einosuke.
He used to work for Matsudaira Sahyo- nosuke, the Yada Clan Chief in Joshu.
I see. Matsudaira Sahyonosuke and li Naosuke are very close friends. That's a very obvious connection.
Besides, it's unusual that he's friends with Niiro.
Sir Hoshino, why not eliminate these two from our group, right now?
No, wait. We can't possibly do that.
These two...
...have become well acquainted with our other men and many are undoubtedly loyal to them.
It would be different, if they chose to leave on their own but if we discharge them, it might send the wrong message to the men.
Besides, these two are no average swordsmen.
So, they'll be very useful to us, if the need arises.
But, if we don't do something...
Go check their homes and backgrounds.
Report on their activities in detail.
And, if either turns out to be an infiltrator working for... or, if there's any reason for us to suspect them, then we'll slay them without mercy!
The sooner we find out, the better.
If we've been infiltrated by li's agents, who knows how he'll strike against us, and when.
We're dealing with the one they call the "Demon of Hikone," after all.
He who instigated the vicious and merciless Ansei Purge.
Well? So, what next?
When will we attempt to carry out our mission again?
As the saying goes, "Walls have ears, doors have eyes."
It's not that I suspect you as well.
But, only I should know the actual date for now.
Yes.
But, for the time being, let me tell you this...
We won't be waiting for long.
The date of the next attack has been decided upon.
However, aside from Chief Hoshino
Kenmotsu, nobody knows when except that it will be in the very near future.
So, you're telling me that the suspects were gathered near the Inner Moat?
Correct, sir. I estimate there were about thirty ronin, mostly of Mito origin.
How were you able to determine that they were from Mito?
Someone close to them must have allowed an "exchange of information" to occur.
That's the only plausible explanation.
If we continue to let these rebels have their way who knows what undesirable consequences await us?
We should strike at them now.
The Ansei Purge was a bit harsh, in hindsight.
That being the case, wouldn't we be repeating that error
...if we attack them, based only on a suspicion?
No, sir, it's not just a suspicion.
Until they've actually done something, it's no more than a suspicion, isn't it?
In that case, your processions must be more heavily guarded!
The foundations of the Tokugawa shogunate aren't that weak!
I didn't cancel my trip to the Castle today because of your concerns.
I did it so I could meet the messenger who arrived this morning and hear from him the current situation in Kyoto and Osaka.
The Great Elder, assaulted by ronin, in broad daylight?
How in the world could such a absurd thing happen?
For 300 years, the authority and spirit of the Tokugawa have endured.
It will never be so weak as to succumb to something as ludicrous as that!
It sure feels like spring today!
Sure does. It's already February 20th.
So the good weather is no surprise.
There must be a lot of visitors coming to Edo.
We've a lot to be thankful for.
By the way... have you found an appointment yet?
Well... nothing ever goes as one would hope.
That must be Elder li, right?
Yes. It's time for him to leave the Castle.
Anytime you see him, he looks like a man full of vigor.
Surely. He's the strong right hand of the shogun, after all.
If it weren't for him, our business wouldn't be prospering as it is.
I have much to thank him for.
As always, leading the procession of men are
Nishikawa Chuzaemon and about thirty of his aides.
With their guards, they totaled approximately sixty in all.
The procession, and the number of men, hasn't changed.
It is said that there's a spy among the men but, could it really be true?
Mito Mansion
To investigate Niiro Tsuruchiyo's abode, a meeting is held between Inada Juzo and two other men. It is February 21st.
His home is a disheveled and bare hut built out of mud by the Kanda-Kamakura riverbed, in a little-traveled area.
What does he do to earn his three meals a day?
What does he do for living?
Sir, from what I can gather, he doesn't have a steady job.
If one could call it an occupation, he bodyguards for Bizenya Tatsukichi, an employment agent in Fujimi Village.
We know that a monster like you is working here!
We'd like to save face... but, no, not for this pittance!
So, it's a pittance. What're you gonna do about it?
This is what I'll do!
Go back where you came from, you pest!
Or we'll break your arm right off!
So, he's quite capable.
And seems to be an extremely dangerous bodyguard at that.
Surely, sir.
Still, I doubt he can afford to eat three times a day on what Bizenya pays.
Certainly, he couldn't afford the booze that he loves.
So, he referees matches, and raids gambling houses and dojo.
He's more or less a blackmailer.
He'll do anything but steal and murder, so he can indulge in wine and women.
What about family ties?
Sir, there was his mother, but she passed away five years ago.
Mother died five years ago, eh?
So... how did this monster become one of us?
Sir, what happened was...
May you rest in peace...
Your deaths won't be forgotten!
We swear we'll behead "Red Devil" li!
Your deaths won't be forgotten!
Run for it! Follow me!
You're all with the House of Mito, right?
Yes, sir.
A foot-soldier; 10-koku and 3 retainers.
An aide to the Commissioner of
Shrines; 3-ryo and 2 retainers.
An aide to a District Commissioner;
7-koku and 2 retainers.
You're nothing but a bunch of superfluous lackeys.
I was hoping that at least one of you was an Elder's son... or the son of a troop leader
...I guess I was wrong.
So the reason Tsuruchiyo helped them was because... if one of them turned out to be an important figure... he could extort a large sum of money?
No, that wasn't it.
"Built with utmost care..." but the Ecchu
Loincloth, upon completion, falls apart.
Well, you see... If one of you were somebody significant, then
I could've asked for a reward for saving you.
I could've used that chance to obtain a position, but...
The Ecchu Loincloth must've fallen apart!
Well... as we are of low rank, we really don't have any way to thank you.
No matter how much searching you do around Edo it's impossible to stumble upon a truly sweet opportunity.
So you see, from now on if you aren't a high-ranking officer somewhere... you're doomed.
But you're such a swordsman that any Daimyo house would want you.
Don't be ridiculous. You're all men with meager positions in life... but you still don't know the hardships of being a ronin.
You have no idea to what extremes I've sunk... I've done everything I can.
Skills alone won't get you anywhere.
I wonder if what you're saying is true.
By the way, fellows... you were saying some rather serious things back there in Nihonbashi.
About beheading Elder li, or something to that effect.
But, you know... that's pretty interesting.
Certainly interesting, if you're really serious about doing it.
Sir, what you're saying is very odd.
Still, you wouldn't have saved us if you didn't resent Elder li's arbitrary conduct.
I've got nothing to do with him, no connections whatsoever!
I hold no grudge against him, nor am I indebted to him.
He's a complete stranger to me.
No, that can't be so!
Otherwise, why help? If you got caught, you'd be in prison along with us!
You bunch of rockheads!
Sure, li Naosuke is indeed the "Red Devil..." from your viewpoint as men of Mito.
But it's different, for someone like me, who's got no connection to him.
The reason there's been a lot of political crap these last few years is because the Tokugawa and their allies are scheming about who'll be the next shogun, that is. Isn't that so?
The House of Mito wants Nariaki's son,
Yoshinobu, to be the next shogun.
And, you want Nariaki to live in the
Castle's Nishinomaru Quarters... so that he can rule the nation.
But...
Listen to me until
I'm done!
Everything seemed to be set, then he stepped forward to oppose you.
That was li Naosuke, the Lord of Hikone.
He used his post as the Great
Elder to bring to
Edo Castle a 13-year old, one Yoshi- tomi, from the House of Kii and basically made him the
14th shogun, lemochi.
The infuriated, uncalmable
Mito faction allied with clans from Satsuma and Choshu who shared the same feelings of outrage and won the support of officials in Kyoto who then brought the matter to the attention of the Emperor.
Once the Emperor learned of this... he declared that the shogunate, that is, li Naosuke's achievement, was far from desirable.
And so, it was li Naosuke's turn to be most imperially enraged.
He discharged the officials that worked for the Emperor and arrested men from
Mito and Satsuma... sent them to prison, beheaded them, and so forth.
This was the so-called
"Ansei Purge."
Well? Did I get any of it wrong?
Indeed. There's truth in what you've said, sir.
But, there's something important that you've overlooked.
Say what?
Consider shogun lemochi, only 14-years old, of the House of Kii.
The question is, can He save Japan from the crisis it faces?
From the North comes Russia, from the East, America.
From the West come England and France.
Should He make one little error, what'll happen to Japan then?
We must destroy li Naosuke, the Devil, immediately and make the Glorious Hitotsubashi
Yoshinobu shogun.
We must rebuild the shogunate as quickly as possible, or we'll be allowing the Emperor to be disgraced as well!
We aren't just concerned about who will be the next shogun.
That's enough.
Imperialists, Anti-shogunate or whatever it does me no good to listen to lame arguments like these.
What matters is whether... you truly intend to kill Naosuke or are you just all talk?
If you're planning to do it, then count me in.
Li Naosuke's head is easily worth a thousand ryo.
I'll do my best, demonstrate my skill... and then I'll have his head!
That way, Mito, Satsuma, or
Choshu... one of them will want to engage me, at a high price.
That much is true, without a doubt!
So... sir, what is your name?
Niiro Tsuruchiyo. Formerly of
Bishu clan, now a ronin.
So, he joined us because he wants to become a legitimate samurai... Just that?
Correct, sir. During our mission, he will do his best for the cause and after we succeed, he'll request that the Mito, or another clan... grant him a position.
That is his only motivation, sir.
At sunset that day, Hagiiwara
Matasaburo reports on the living conditions of Kurihara
Einosuke, the other suspect.
Thank you for your hard work.
Sir, Kurihara Einosuke's home is situated in
Honjo-Koume, where liege vassals and rich merchants maintain second homes.
Honjo-Koume?
Kurihara was once a retainer in the employ of
Matsudaira Sahyonosuke, the chief of the Yada clan in Joshu, and his stipend was more than 300-koku.
300-koku? He must've been an important man.
As close to his Clan Lord as Kurihara was as important as he was
...why did he leave his clan, become a ronin, and join us?
That, sir, we don't know for sure, but according to Yamamoto, a close confidante of his
Kurihara is an exceptional, avid scholar, who is well-read in Western philosophy.
Based on his studies, he strongly believes that unless Elder li is destroyed, Japan will not see the dawn of a new era.
His scholarly studies lead him to believe that the death of li is imperative?
That, sir, is what Yamamoto has told me.
By the way, this Kurihara as he is no longer an aide to his Clan Lord how, then, can he afford to live in such a noteworthy mansion?
Sir, as for that his wife, Mitsu, happens to be the daughter of Kagaya Seibei a shipping agent in Shinmachi, near Shiba Shiodome Bridge.
The mansion is Seibei's second home.
Thus, Kurihara's leisurely lifestyle in the mansion is not, I believe, grounds to suspect anything.
And so, Kurihara Einosuke can spend his days focusing his mind on scholarship and swordmanship.
I can well appreciate that he's absorbed in his studies... but, "swordmanship?"
Yes, sir. In Okachi Village, in Shitaya, one Tachibana Isshinsai runs a dojo, specializing in the Nen Style.
Now, this Kurihara Einosuke, and Niiro Tsuruchiyo...
I hear that the two are on very good terms.
Yes, that's correct, sir.
Their personalities and lifestyles make them complete opposites.
How could they possibly get along so well? How?
Well, I wondered about that myself, sir.
A comrade named Kojima Kaname ought to know the answer as he's especially close to Niiro Tsuruchiyo.
You should definitely hear what
Kojima has to say, sir.
- In December of last year, eh?
- Yes, sir.
It was close to the New Year.
Having become uneasy about the advent of the New Year
Niiro headed to Tachibana Isshinsai's dojo in Okachi Village in Shitaya after discussions with his fellow rogue ronin.
For what purpose?
Sir... it was for Dojo-harassment.
Not good...
That will be all.
We've accommodated enough outside styles for today. Please leave.
Impossible!
Here I stand.
I believe that I've clearly demonstrated our strengths to your four friends.
If you want to brag, you ought to wait until you've finished dueling with me.
It seems I have no choice. Very well then, please prepare yourself.
I'm ready right now!
What?
'Twas... a long duel that left us speechless with admiration... but, in the end...
Their skills were perfectly matched, so if they continued, the result would have been a simultaneous strike and both would have suffered grievous injuries.
So, the match was concluded.
If I may so ask... that is Jigen-
Ichi-Style, isn't it?
That is correct.
Your Nen Style seems rather useful.
I haven't had this good of a workout in a while.
After that, the two rapidly became close friends.
Occasionally, Niiro would visit Kurihara's mansion in Honjo-Koume.
Actually, I personally accompanied him once or twice.
He laughed!
The son of Kurihara Einosuke Eiichiro?
What a fine name it is!
A fine name, indeed!
Eiichiro... You're so lucky to have such wonderful parents!
Sir Niiro, do you have children yet?
I may not look like it, but I'm very much blessed!
Pun: "Ju-ni:" Twelve. "Ni-Ju:" Twenty.
Pun: "Ju-ni:" Twelve. "Ni-Ju:" Twenty.
Twenty, in all!
Surely you're joking!
Well, not only don't I have kids, but I don't even have a wife.
I didn't realize.
I am sorry.
How about your parents?
Are they alive?
I did have a mother, but she left this world five years ago.
I'm so sorry.
That old fool... I constantly gave her a hard time when she was alive.
You see, I have no idea who my father is.
He doesn't know his father?
Correct, sir.
By the way, Kojima...
How could such a fatherless fellow be a Bishu ronin? Do you know?
Sir Hoshino, I don't mean to be disrespectful to you, sir... but Niiro is not a spy for the House of li.
I, Kojima Kaname, personally attest!
If you can't determine the answer, then we'll have someone else find out.
But, Sir Sumida...
You were, after all, assigned the duty of watching the others yet, you've not once passed on anything concerning Niiro!
What exactly have you been doing every day?
Just what's Niiro been up to, since our last meeting?
Sir, the truth is that
...lately, since the February 17th plan was called off, our comrades congregated at Sagamiya in Shinagawa where we had an official meeting.
We know that already!
Ever since then... Niiro has been staying at Sagamiya and refuses to leave, no matter what we do!
"Botamochi during the Bon Festival...
"Udon-noodles during the day..."
Get Okiku! Okiku,
I said!
Here, now! Have some sake!
I'm not staying here so I can look at your ugly gourd of a face!
Get your boss!
Get Okiku!
Madam! How many days do we have to put up with him?
We gotta get him to go! I'm going to call in the Constabulary!
But you know...
...if the Constabulary comes around, business will suffer.
"Botamochi during the Bon Festival...
"Udon-noodles during the day...
"Have rice at night...
My... if it isn't the arrival of the Ocean Princess!
- Sir Niiro...
- What is it?
You've been here far too long, sir.
Your family must be worried about you.
Mind your own business!
I must say this; forgive my rudeness...
Say what?
Because you arrived with my long-time patrons, the gentlemen of Mito,
I realized that I couldn't possibly be impolite to you, until today.
I ask that you settle your account for the time being as financial matters need to be taken care of.
So what if you need to take care of financial matters?
I'd like you to pay what you owe us, and kindly ask that you return home for the time being.
If our Sagamiya is to your liking, then please come back again at a later date.
Since you demand it of me, I will leave.
But, let me tell you, lady...
I've got no money!
But if you tell me that you'll be in trouble if I don't pay then I guarantee that
I'll get the money after I leave, that is.
Please don't be concerned about the bill, sir.
I merely ask that you leave.
You're so aloof...
What are you doing?
So aloof...
Listen you, sooner or later...
I will become a full-fledged, two-sword retainer with four or five-hundred koku in income!
When that happens, Okiku... I will come here, to make you my wife!
Enough kidding around!
If you don't stop, I will be forced to call in the Constables!
Lady... how much do I owe you?
I don't care about that!
However, I ask that you never come here again!
As long as I pay,
I'm a customer.
No... perhaps it is you who owe me money, lady.
Listen, Okiku... I've become like this... like a stray dog... because of you.
"Kisoya's"
Tell your boss, Masagoro.
He'll understand.
Tell him that Tsuruchiyo is here.
That's Niiro Tsuruchiyo!
It's been five years, hasn't it?
Since the last time I saw you.
You look healthy, at least from what I can see.
Isn't that obvious?
But, it's so disgraceful...
Your mother would be so saddened, if she were still alive.
Stop talking about my mother!
I've come here to discuss money!
No, it cannot be.
Kisoya... you and my mother were two of a kind. Don't try acting otherwise.
Indeed, two of a kind... that was your mother and I.
We sacrificed everything to help you become an honorable samurai.
We encouraged you to excel in swords- manship... and academics...
And, look what happened...
But, these five years that I've had to live alone... I've learned a lot.
I left the path of the samurai once but it made me realize how cold society can be.
Anyway, these days, you either become a merchant like you and save money, or become a respectable samurai and strut around!
That is, if you've got any desire to live like a human being.
But, I can't imagine being a merchant or craftsman.
Of course not! Not you!
There you go again, just like mother did!
If there's really samurai blood in me, as you've always said then why can't you tell me who my father is?
I'm not a kid anymore... It's no use trying to hide it!
But, let me say this... l've had it... with living like a lone wolf!
I'll become...
...a real, spear-carrying samurai.
I'll become more important than you or my mother ever was.
I'm about to get involved in a fateful undertaking not just that... it's a once- in-a-lifetime opportunity!
I'll keep on top of this opportunity and I'll never let go of it, even if lightning strikes me!
Sir Tsuruchiyo... what exactly are you referring to?
Forget it.
I'll tell you about it someday... when I return with four or five vassals in tow.
Today's topic is money!
10-ryo!
- I must object, sir.
- What?
You say you've suffered greatly... but you don't know what suffering is!
The reason you've become this way,
Sir Tsuruchiyo, is because we always pampered you, perhaps too much!
Kisoya... so you're not going to give me money?
If that's not to your liking, then force open my safe yourself!
You've not been to this mansion in five years yet as soon as you do, look what happens!
On top of it, you come up with some fantastic story...
"If I go to Kisoya's, I can get money, no matter what."
You always behaved like a spoiled brat! You haven't changed a bit!
I, Kisoya Masagoro, refuse to give you a single mon!
If you're not going to pay... then I'll just have to ask my creditor to come here.
I must say that what I saw today was splendid.
Shichidayu Dances... Always a delight to see.
When people say something is "out of this world," this is what they mean.
They've all dedicated their lives to their craft.
'Tis the excellence achieved only by those devoted to a single thing.
However...
Why did you choose an evocative piece as the "Kurozuka?"
Well, as I would be watching the play with you, Sir Sahyonosuke...
I thought that we ought to watch something joyous and gorgeous but, 'tis disheartening that you see it only as an evocatory piece!
If you put it that way, I must not say what I was about to say.
No need for such formality.
Please speak your mind.
A unit of Mito's Tengu Faction has assembled and they've filtered into our district.
Yes, I'm aware of that.
They pose as Mito vassals, and can use the Mito Mansion in Koishikawa.
From this base, they've contacted
Satsuma and Choshu vassals and together, they've been hatching various plots.
I am aware of that, too.
Things look to be coming to a head.
And, if so?
What if... your life were in danger?
- That's totally ludicrous!
- But... what if it were so?
- No, it will not happen.
- Why not?
Do you expect me to put it in words?
Tell me. Today, tell me everything.
Our Fourteenth shogun, lemochi... is how old as of this year?
Fourteen years old.
I am the Lord of Hikone, a Tokugawa- affiliated domain.
I am the li Family's 15th descendant:
"Kamonnokami" Naosuke.
And, to top it off, I'm the Great
Elder of the shogunate.
It is no exaggeration to say that the Tokugawa government cannot run without me.
So, why would the men of Mito seek my life?
At a time when we're faced with many national dilemmas... the Mito... one of the three Great
Houses, wants me dead?
It's ridiculous!
If I were to die now, the shogunate would crumble into dust!
We are living in unstable times.
Reforming the government by killing me?
'Tis nothing but a bad story, fabricated by fools!
Should anybody dare to destroy me...
...the 300-year old Tokugawa government would fall.
And that would mean that the age of the samurai would be over!
Concerning Niiro Tsuruchiyo's background even though his real father's identity is unknown... the fact is, Niiro Soan, a Bishu clan physician, acted as his father.
So, this Niiro Soan, a physician to the Bishu with a fief of 10-koku, and two lackeys, is his adoptive father?
That means... he's considered to be a Bishu ronin?
Certainly, sir.
So he must've tried to get a position in Edo somewhere, but failed... so that explains why he's living like an outcast.
Yes. I believe that's a plausible explanation, sir.
Although I did suspect him, I don't think Niiro is the culprit anymore.
- What's the matter?
- Allow me to report to you.
We've unmasked the betrayers... spies associated with the li!
What?
It went to the mansion of Matsudaira Sahyonosuke?
Yes, sir. From the Akasaka
Gate, to the right, then further up Ushinaki Hill via
Omote-Denma Village, then down Yagen Hill... past the shogunate Sentries' office.
No doubt about it, sir.
Matsudaira Sahyonosuke, the head of
Joshu-Yada, has a mansion there.
As it seemed rather peculiar, we investigated further.
The woman in the palanquin was Lady
Ochiyo, Matsudaira's concubine.
Why would Matsudaira's concubine visit Kurihara?
Mitsu, Kurihara's wife, and this
Lady Ochiyo happen to be... sisters, blood relatives!
To check, we went to Shiodome, and checked with some shipping agents.
One Kagaya Seibei had two daughters.
The older is the Lady Ochiyo... concubine to Matsudaira Sahyonosuke, head of the Yada clan in Joshu.
Her sister is the wife of Kurihara Eino- suke, a close aide to Matsudaira!
We have verified all of this, sirs!
Our secrets have spread from Kurihara to Matsudaira Sahyonosuke.
And, from Sahyonosuke to li the "Kamonnokami?"
So that's how it is.
Really... one can never tell about some people.
Well, I for one have always believed that it was rather odd that
Kurihara joined us!
So how shall we deal with this?
What's up?
What do you mean, "what's up?"
I heard from Kojima Kaname that you're here all the time so I became worried.
Come on, Niiro.
Let's go home.
Don't worry about the bill...
I've taken care of it.
- What did you say?
- I've taken care of it, the whole thing.
It's none of your concern.
Madam Okiku took the money from you, then?
No, I didn't see the Madam.
I was told that she was visiting a lumber- yard in Fuyuki Village, in Fukagawa.
This struck me as somewhat strange, but... I paid the head clerk.
Like I told you, you should've minded your own business!
You don't pay the clerk!
But, the fact that she went to the Fuka- gawa lumberyard is interesting the fact that Okiku did that...
Now, that makes me laugh!
I am Okiku, the Madam of Sagamiya.
Niiro requested that I send my clerk here but the matter isn't settled yet, so I've come here in person.
I'm sorry to interrupt your busy schedule.
So, miss, you're the... You're from Sagamiya?
Yes, sir. I am she who is called Madam Okiku.
My goodness.
Really... it's remarkable how there can be look-alikes in this world.
When they say "be as alike as two split melons," they mean this!
"Two melons?"
No wonder Sir Niiro did what he did...
No wonder... he couldn't have helped himself!
Pardon me, but... what do you mean by that, sir?
When I first met Sir Niiro, he also had a surprised look on his face, like yours, sir... and wouldn't stop staring at me.
I'm curious as to why...
No... as long as I can collect what he owes, that's all it matters.
But... something about this does bother me.
If you don't mind, sir, please tell me.
I'm sure that there must be a reason not to tell me but, if I don't ask... then I'll regret it.
No... if I may be blunt... it does feel somewhat ominous.
...if I may so ask,
Mr. Kisoya...
Well, sooner or later, I would've had to tell...
- ...you, of all people, at least.
- Excuse me?
There is too much of a resemblance... too much for mere strangers.
As this may involve you in the future, please allow me to explain.
But, remember... I am telling you this because you seem trustworthy.
Please, never tell anyone.
Not even Sir Niiro.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir. I'm not Okiku of Sagamiya for nothing... I know that much.
The blood of a samurai family runs in Sir Niiro's veins.
I cannot reveal their name, but they are of exceptional legacy and status.
But, he is the son of a concubine or rather, I should say, adolescent mistakes resulted in his birth.
The woman... gave birth to him back in her home town.
There was a reason for that.
It was not possible for the son to be recognized by the father.
It so happens that the woman's father and I were very close friends so, recognizing how sad the situation was
I chose to take young Niiro and his mother with me and we proceeded to a certain place.
It was the house of a physician, who worked for a major Daimyo.
We went there so that the child could be adopted.
Instead of growing up in a merchant's house like mine, it would be better for him to be raised in the house of a physician with samurai connections.
That was what we, the child's mother and I, concluded.
But, when young Niiro turned
13, the physician was transferred to a country fief within his Lord's domain where, later, he contracted an illness and died.
That happened when
Sir Niiro was 22.
However, he had no desire to succeed his physician "father."
Together with his mother, he left for Edo, in search of me.
He said that he had no intention of becoming a physician
...but instead wanted to become a samurai of rank.
I myself believe that nothing is impossible, at least in spirit so, after discussing it with his mother, we let him study at a dojo in Ichigaya Yarai, under
Sir Todo Tatewaki, a master of the Jigen-lchi Style.
As for academics, we sent him to
Sir Miura Ansai's seminary in Yanaka-Oiwakekata Village.
For the next seven years,
Sir Niiro was a young man, full of hope who immersed himself in the worlds of academics and swordsmanship.
His mother and I both looked forward to his success and bright future, with pride in our hearts.
This anticipation was not at all a dream. It was no fantasy.
I knew that Sir Niiro's real father, an important shogunate official also took an interest in his future.
When the time came, when Sir
Niiro could live on his own on the day when he became a respectable, deserving man... we had secretly arranged for a very special event to occur.
But... like they say, "Nothing ever goes as planned."
An unexpected incident took place... one that drastically changed
Sir Niiro's life.
It was about a month before he was to receive what he had worked for a Commendation for Completion of Studies at the Todo Dojo.
In anticipation of this most commemorative event to pray for his life-long blessing in swordsmanship...
...we visited Kashima Shrine, in Hitachi, where the Gods of War are sanctified.
On the way back, we enjoyed a boat-ride in Itako.
It's nothing but rice fields, every which way!
"Oh, if only the Irises were in bloom!"
Captain, we're bored to death!
Take us somewhere!
Anywhere!
Excuse me, but seeing as we're traveling together, how about pouring me a drink?
Both the lady and I are a bit seasick, not feeling all that well.
I am sorry but we cannot serve you.
It must be fate that has brought us together. Pour me a drink.
It wouldn't be all that enjoyable if an old woman like me were to serve you.
I believe that it's best if you drink such valuable sake amongst yourselves.
You're too soft, fellow.
Let me handle this!
C'mon, just one drink!
Pour me some!
As I just told you...
I'm not asking you, old Mushroom!
I'm asking this wench, over here!
Don't be so conceited!
I ask you, just a drink!
How dare you!
Sir! You're being unreasonable!
Shut up!
You young punk!
Kill him!
You bastard!
Come back here!
Just who was the lady that you speak of?
She was of the House of
Takatsukasa in Kyoto the daughter of Sir Ichijo Narihisa, the 3rd-ranking General.
Such an important person!
On top of that, this "princess" was named "Kiku-hime."
Oh, my... Even our names are the same!
Indeed... Strange things can happen in this world.
So... what happened after that?
You may fool others... but you cannot deceive the eyes of this samurai!
Who do you wait for... at Kanda Myojin
Shrine, after the day's lessons?
You are still in training... yet you're lusting after women!
How dare you let your mind stray from the sword?
Further carelessness won't be tolerated!
Kiku-hime was to wed the eldest son of Miyamori Betto a distinguished Shinto priest known throughout the Kanto region.
As Sir Kii's auxiliary mansion was in Edo, near the Akasaka Gates she often traveled there with her father,
Sir Narihisa, all the way from Kyoto.
Kiku-hime would leave the Kii Mansion just about every day to visit Matsunaga Wafu's residence, to study Nagauta singing.
For a lady of a famous family, she's rather spirited.
Instead of requesting that the instructor visit her, she'd travel so she could take lessons in the company of regular girls.
It seems that you're visiting the Kanda
Myojin Shrine all the time, Miss Ichijo.
- Offering special prayers, perhaps?
- No, I don't believe in gods or buddhas.
Then, perhaps you're meeting someone special there?
Yes... Someone special is waiting for me.
If you'll excuse me...
The relationship between the two grew stronger every day but there was no way that such a thing could last for long.
Soon, Sir Ichijo Narihisa came up with ways to prevent Kiku-hime from leaving the
Kii Mansion even for a minute.
Then... nobody knows how Kiku-hime managed to do it...
...she somehow eluded her guards... and escaped from the mansion!
You've run away, just to be here?
Yes... my father wishes me to marry... against my will.
I had to be here, even if I had to run away!
I care not for status!
I thought that, if this is what Kiku- hime really wants, then l'd offer to talk to Sir Ichijo, in hopes that the matter might be resolved
...by offering him a solution to his problem.
Why force apart two people in love?
What if it causes them to plan to elope?
Who knows what kind of nightmare it could become?
So I imposed upon a merchant who frequented the Kii Mansion...
...and after much discussion we were able to arrange a meeting with Sir Ichijo Narihisa who was staying in the West
Quarters of the Mansion.
Kisoya... haven't you ever heard people say that "lanterns and bells can never go together?"
But, Sir Ichijo...
Listen to me, Kisoya.
The owner of this mansion,
Sir Kii Yorihisa happens to be the 3rd-ranking
Provincial General.
But, 3rd-ranking means... that they're at the same level as my House.
That means, Kisoya...
...that unless he's the noble son of a Daimyo or something discussing his marriage to a princess is just absurd, isn't it?
"Unless he's the noble son of a Daimyo or something...?"
That's right.
The truth is that...
What is it?
No... It's nothing.
"Unless he's the noble son of a Daimyo or something..."
Considering the situation, I considered revealing Tsuruchiyo's lineage... but I just couldn't, not without asking you.
Of course not.
Even if marriage negotiations were entered into who knows what problems of social standing might arise?
Besides, until he becomes a worthy warrior until he's mastered swordmanship, and we can be proud of him... until then, the truth must not be revealed.
That was the promise we and His
Highness made to each other.
We're nowhere near that time!
In the meantime, the marriage negotiations concerning
Kiku-hime and Miyamori Betto's eldest son continued to progress.
But, Tsuruchiyo could not wrest
Kiku-hime from his heart.
Eventually, he marched straight into Sir Kii's mansion.
What you've just told me, and the manner in which you said it...
I for one believe it's a bit impudent.
But, sir, Kiku-hime clearly objects to marrying the son of Sir Miyamori.
Whom my daughter will marry... is none of your concern.
Of course, it is my daughter's life we're talking about... so I cannot say that I have not considered you.
But, having done so, I have concerns, and so I simply cannot consent to it.
Niiro Soan, the Bishu clan physician, was merely a father figure to you.
Actually, he's not your real father.
That means you're but the son of some concubine a man who doesn't know who his father is.
How can I possibly give my precious daughter to someone so lowly?
But, what if I return with my parents? What then?
That depends on what happens... when your parents and I talk.
Kisoya... why won't you tell me the name of my father?
Why won't you tell me who my father is?
Why won't you tell me?
Why do you say that keeping it a secret is for own my good?
If you're doing it for my sake, then tell me! Tell me who my father is!
Tell me! Mother!
Tell me!
Next! Who's next?
You friggin' brat!
Brat! Twerp!
You womanizing, drunken crazy bastard!
Forget about your
Certificate!
As of today, we're no longer teacher and student... you're expelled!
You are to never step into this dojo ever again!
"To become a samurai is to master the sword?" To hell with it!
"As of today, we're no longer teacher and student?" That's for me to say!
This world never works the way you want it to anyway!
I, Niiro Tsuruchiyo, will live my life my own way!
As of that day, Sir Tsuruchiyo... left this house as well.
...from that day on, he became like a rolling stone, tumbling down a steep hill.
Does that mean, Sir Tsuruchiyo is dead, as far as we're concerned?
That's correct, sir.
He's no longer living in this world.
Sir Nozaka... even if you should meet someone that resembles Tsuruchiyo in every way... he's no longer Niiro Tsuruchiyo.
What happened to Sir Tsuruchiyo over the next five years?
Well, you know very well just what happened...
I understand now.
Actually, I understand very well now.
But, I'm not the Princess
Kiku that you speak of.
I cannot possibly do anything for Sir Niiro.
No, you should not be so concerned.
Still, no matter what foolish deeds he's done if it can be repaid with money, then I, Kisoya, will...
And, then... well,
Okiku...
If you ever get a chance to...
I know he can be like a wolf sometimes, but please say something kind once in a while, a "hello" would do.
Yes, of course.
One, two...
Thank you for your patience!
Here you go, ma'am!
Welcome back, ma'am!
He's gone home, ma'am!
"Gone home?"
Madame, no more.
I'm fine.
It's just ordinary home cooking, but did you like it?
Very good!
Somehow... I feel at ease only when I'm at your place.
It's intriguing.
Well, how could someone like you be so out of control at Sagamiya?
Well, don't worry about that.
Sir Niiro, would you like more sake?
No, I've had plenty already.
Sir Niiro, would you like more sake?
Wait...
I just can't understand something.
What is it?
Something about you.
What don't you understand about me?
Your life... It seems to me to be peacefulness itself.
Why then... have you joined the cause?
It should be obvious to you. My reason is the same as yours.
No. You shouldn't joke about it.
I'm different from you.
If I don't do something, I'll either starve like a stray dog...
...or have to live like a bandit.
"In order to stay dry, you've got to cross bridges, no matter how dangerous."
On the other hand... your situation is completely different.
You resigned from a comfortable 300- koku post as a shogunate aide!
My principles, you see... are contained in the books you see there.
The world is fast changing around us.
The 300-year old feudal govern- ment of the shogunate is doomed, thanks to the arrival of the
American Black Ships at Shimoda.
The world is moving in a new direction and I want to help push it forward with all my might.
My feelings are the same as yours.
No, it's different. I...
Well, listen!
You're deliberately blinding yourself to what's really essential... and putting the blame on something else.
We are both at the center of a vortex of revolutionary change.
We're trapped in an unstoppable, enormous whirlpool...
And, everyone is thinking...
"I've got to do something."
No, I'm not like that.
For me, this is the surest, quickest way of becoming a noble samurai.
In other words... I want to live more like a human being... And that's all.
What's the matter?
"Like a human being," you said?
- Why, is that crazy?
- No, it's not crazy.
In essence, I feel the same way you do.
However, what I am doing... I'm not doing just for myself...
...but, for the whole human race so that everyone can live like human beings. That's all that I wish for.
I don't understand...
I don't understand it at all.
There's only one thing that I understand... that you, Kurihara Einosuke, are a good man. That's all.
Oh, Ma'am, please don't mind me.
By the way, where's young Eiichiro?
Oh, he's sound asleep.
"Strong becomes a child that sleeps often," like they say, eh?
Well, I'd better get going myself.
Give yourself a break, Sir Niiro. Why don't you stay here tonight?
No, I cannot do that.
It might be a disheveled hut, but for me, it's my one and only castle.
By going home to my castle, I can sleep the way I want to...
...with my knees in my arms!
Please excuse us for coming in while you were away.
We would like to make a formal request of you, Niiro.
- A request?
- Correct.
We'd like you to assassinate the traitor in our midst.
A traitor?
Who is it?
A former Yada clansman from
Joshu, Kurihara Einosuke.
What?
It can't be true!
Besides, what evidence do you have?
As they say, "Before accusing, question seven times!"
Actually, Niiro... to be honest, we suspected you too at first.
But, we found that there were no grounds to suspect you and that Kurihara Einosuke is the traitor. We apologize for this.
Why do you say that Kurihara Einosuke is the traitor? Explain!
Are you familiar with his wife?
Yes, I am. She is an admirable, wonderful wife.
What about her older sister?
Her sister? No, I don't know her.
The sister of Kurihara's wife is named
Chiyo... She is the Lady Ochiyo... a concubine of Matsudaira Sahyono- suke, Lord of the Yada clan in Joshu!
Upon learning this, we too were stunned.
No... We were being too trusting.
Niiro... Matsudaira Sahyonosuke and Kurihara could be considered to be brothers-in-law.
Lady Ochiyo has often visited Kurihara's mansion in Honjo-Koume.
Thus, anything could... No... everything will, via Sahyonosuke be relayed to li Naosuke, the devil himself!
But... that alone does not prove that
Kurihara acted on li's behalf!
Niiro... are you saying, then, that you've never suspected Kurihara of anything, ever?
He's not of Mito, Satsuma or Choshu provinces.
I don't mean to insult you... he's not an opportunist like you either.
Matsudaira's close affiliation with the shogun means they're close to li, too.
Besides, Kurihara was a trusted aide of
Matsudaira, the head of the Yada clan.
So why did he join us?
Well, that's because...
Niiro... our decisive moment is just over the horizon.
When we decide on the date, and carry out our mission what will happen to us if li's men are forewarned?
We'll be arrested for sure!
And then we'll all be hung from the tops of trees!
Anyone suspicious must be eliminated as fast as possible, no matter what.
I refuse to do it...
I cannot do it!
Then, who will?
Kurihara has mastered the secrets of the Nen Style...
Even two or three of our comrades wouldn't stand a chance.
Indeed, he'd cut them all down in an instant.
And, if we send many men, it'll stir up a lot of trouble and attention.
You, Niiro... You're the only one who can destroy Kurihara!
Here's the plan. Kojima will tell him that, even though it's late... an emergency meeting will be held at
Yamazakiya, by the Nihonbashi Bridge.
You'll be waiting for Kurihara by the river- side, where people won't be around.
There, you will slay him in one stroke.
Fine. Well, that's too bad.
There's not much more we can do to try and convince you.
Niiro... effective immediately, you are to...
...leave our Elder Assassination
Group!
What did you say?
We were hoping that you were with us, and that we could count on you.
But, if you can't be convinced, then... there's nothing to be done. Farewell.
Wait!
I pledge that... I'll serve you, and that I will destroy li Naosuke!
But, Kurihara Einosuke must be destroyed first.
We can't possibly proceed with our plans, if we have a viper at our breast! Farewell!
Wait!
Niiro... Then, will you... take care of Kurihara?
Well, you'd prefer not to act alone, I'm sure.
Don't worry. You'll have some help.
Three good swordsmen, in fact.
No, they'd only be a hindrance!
I will kill him by myself!
Who's there?
Why... it's you,
Niiro!
You heard about the meeting at Yamazakiya, right?
Don't give me the wrong idea...
Standing there like that, one might think you want to test your sword on flesh.
Come on.
But... how did you know that
I was coming this way?
Niiro... what's wrong? You don't seem like your usual self tonight...
Niiro! Why?
Why, Niiro?
Why?
Niiro...
Why me?
"'Tis worthless to leave behind valuable things.
"What's worth leaving behind is what's not valuable... Mother's memories,
"imperceptible, intangible...
"That is the reality of this ever-changing world."
Oh? You're not having any?
Sir Niiro, how about a drink of hot sake?
- Sir Niiro?
- Quiet...
But, you shouldn't drink so much.
Be quiet!
Then, perhaps you should make that your last.
"The stomach is a part of the body also," as they say... You should be careful.
This is crazy! You shouldn't...
Ma'am, step outside! Excuse us.
Please excuse us for a moment!
Niiro, something's come up! Something horribly unexpected!
What is it? Is our mission starting?
No, that's not it! Well, Niiro... we've found out who the real traitor was!
Kurihara Einosuke was innocent!
What?
It was all an awful mistake!
What?
Kurihara didn't betray us.
The conspirator who spied for li was without a doubt, Masui
Sobei, the Staff Officer.
Sir Kenmotsu is conducting an inquiry back at the mansion!
Explain it!
Masui Sobei, a former
Mito clansman who had been a warehouse clerk, of 80-koku income. 35 years old.
In early February, this year, the said individual covertly maintained a second residence in the hills of Kaminegishi... into which, he installed a mistress.
The source of his funds came under suspicion.
Sir Kenmotsu ordered Seki Tetsunosuke to conduct an investigation and Masui was observed meeting with a samurai near the Nihonbashi Bridge at the tea parlor "Hatsune" in Yanagi Village.
When Seki Tetsunosuke followed them he saw them enter a warehouse owned by li Naosuke... near Nihonbashi's southern, eighth district.
After obtaining the samurai's name from the gate guard... it was revealed that he was Takigawa
Genba, an assistant to a Jr. Elder.
After interrogating Masui about his connection to Takigawa Genba... it was found that Genba worked for li's vassal, Nagano Shuzen and he has been secretly talking to Masui for a long time.
On January 31st, he received 20-ryo, and a further 30 on February 21st...
...totalling 50-ryo. Masui Sobei received these funds from Takigawa Genba.
He confessed to conspiring against us.
Thus, he is hereby sentenced to death.
Then... Kurihara Einosuke had... nothing to do with it?
Niiro... You're such a simple- minded fellow.
You take things too seriously.
You're too frank.
If you don't become a little more dispassionate you can't possibly destroy Elder li!
That has nothing to do with this!
Kurihara Einosuke was one of our comrades!
Also... he had a wife, and even an innocent child.
The blood of
Elder li... and the blood of Kurihara Einosuke... what's the difference?
Sympathy has no place here!
From the start, this has been the nature of our mission.
We can't allow our enemies to wound us without reprisal.
Our hands must get dirty with blood, too.
Listen to me, Niiro!
You must become a little more cold-blooded.
By the 3rd of March, for certain!
What?
On March 3rd, in the center atrium of Edo Castle a Joumi Day Celebration, important to the shogun's family, will take place.
In other words, the so-called
"Peach Observance."
Without a doubt, Elder li Naosuke will attend.
One traitor... and one suspected of being a traitor...
...a total of two comrades have been eliminated.
Finally, our mission can commence!
Get rid of him.
Yes, sir!
Ichigoro...
Erase every single record concerning
Kurihara Einosuke and Masui Sobei.
We must go down in history as devout men of principle.
There's absolutely no need to record anything about traitors.
The mission... was set for March 3rd.
March 3rd of the First Year of Man'en
(1860). The "Peach Observance."
Tomorrow is the "Peach
Observance."
Since I've come to Yokoyama Village, I thought I'd buy these while I'm here...
An Emperor Doll and an Empress Doll... they look so peaceful together.
They're timelessly splendid whenever you look at them.
Many things happen along the road of life, don't they?
They certainly do.
How about it? If I become a noble samurai with 200, 300 koku in income... why don't you become my wife?
But, I cannot possibly be apart from Sagamiya.
Even better,
Sir Niiro... why not say farewell to your dream of becoming some stuffy samurai?
Why not come live with me?
No, I cannot do that.
But... you can't go on chasing a dream forever.
No, it's not a dream... It will soon be reality.
You can't live like that forever, Sir Niiro.
It may be a dream...
No, let's say it is a dream. At least, until it does come true.
But, Sir Nosaka...
It can't be!
Well, I too think that it's impossible.
But, Kisoya...
You must be familiar with the Tengu
Faction of the Mito clan?
Yes.
A part of their group is in Edo, and... we know for a fact that they're planning on carrying out an unfavorable scheme.
Yes...
Well, I'd like to believe otherwise, but... what if what we fear does happen?
You see, the Lord seems to be concerned about the matter.
Although Tsuruchiyo's "death" was officially recorded the Lord has recently been asking about him... most emphatically.
The fearless Lord Himself... asking three times!
Now that we've come this far, he can't claim his official lineage.
If even if it were only a glance...
If our Lord could...
Yet, we cannot not let Sir Tsuruchiyo know anything.
This is such a shameful way of doing things... but we have no choice.
The feelings of the one and the only His Highness, Lord li... and your consideration and concerns, Sir Nosaka... are completely understood, sir! Allow me, Kisoya, to see what can be done!
Welcome.
Thanks again for the other day.
Is he here, by any chance?
You mean Sir Niiro?
Yes.
No, sir.
That's odd...
I went looking for him along the banks of the Kamakura, but he wasn't there.
So I assumed he'd be here.
I did the same thing when I happened to be in Yokoyama this morning...
And, what happened?
Well, he was in then.
I bothered him for a little while before coming home.
I see. I wonder where he could be...
Is this... an urgent matter, sir?
Well, it may be, it may not be...
Well, then, please come in!
Well, it may be, it may not be...
Yes! Thank you.
At times, he can be like a detached kite drifting away! Such a troublemaker!
It'd be nice if he'd walk in here while we're talking.
Oh, Sir Kisoya... didn't you say that it's an urgent matter?
Well, it's not exactly that urgent, but...
You see, a ship carrying some lumber will be arriving tonight from Kiso.
By evening, I must get going to take care of that so I thought it'd be nice if I could see him during the day, just for a moment.
I see. In that case, I will send my clerks to a place where he might be found.
Though, I cannot guarantee that he'll be there.
Oh, if I could impose on you to do that!
And... where might that be, if I may so ask?
The Mito Mansion in Koishigawa.
"The Mito?"
The first time that he came here he was with Mito people, amongst others.
Since then, men from Mito are always coming here asking for Sir Niiro.
So, that's the only place that I can think of.
Sir Tsuruchiyo has been... associating with Mito men?
Yes. They all seem to be on rather good terms with each other.
Well, at any rate, in that case, he might be back by now, so
I shall head over to the
Kamakura riverside now.
Besides, using a palanquin, I could be at the Mito Mansion in no time!
It's you, Okiku.
Sir Niiro hasn't been back yet?
It doesn't seem so.
What about the Mito Mansion?
It's not important enough to get me to go all that way.
Okiku... what brings you here?
Sir Kisoya...
I, Okiku of Sagamiya, feel a bit of resentment!
I sense that there is something about him that you're not telling me.
Even if you can't tell anyone else...
I ask that you tell me, of all people!
I know it's rude for me... Okiku of
Sagamiya... to say this, but... it feels like you're not being frank with me.
Why, it's not whether or not I'm being frank...
It's just that, if I may be blunt...
I have something on my mind.
But it's something that only
I can be concerned about.
I don't know if it'll actually be a problem or not.
What is it... that you're concerned about?
You said that Sir Tsuruchiyo was quite friendly with the men of Mito.
When I heard that,
I panicked.
Is there a problem with him associating with the Mito?
Okiku... you do know about the Tengu Faction of Mito?
Yes, well... that they caused a great commotion. I know that much.
Unscrupulous members of the faction have been sneaking into Edo.
That's the rumor that's going around.
Okiku... about the men Sir
Tsuruchiyo was with...
Are they new to Edo?
Now that you mention it...
...l've seen some new faces... who,
I'm told, were recently posted here.
"New faces?"
Yes. Among my many
Mito customers are new faces with
Satsuma accents... as well as some who seem to be from Choshu.
Okiku, listen... About
Sir Tsuruchiyo...
Have you noticed anything unusual about him recently?
No... Nothing particularly.
The other day... Well, when he came to visit me for the first time... in five years, he told me something quite puzzling.
He said he'd soon become a noble samurai... or words to that effect.
Oh, he told me that, too!
What?
It was just this morning, in fact.
I thought that he must be dreaming, but... he said that he would soon become a noble samurai.
Okiku... I'm afraid that he'll...
Forgive me, Kurihara...
I'll do it...
Finally, tomorrow morning...
For both of us, I shall strive to do my best!
If I may ask, Sir
Kisoya... what did you mean when you said you were concerned about something?
Sir Kisoya.
No, it's just my imagination!
It can't possibly be for real!
I just... cannot make any sense of it all.
Just exactly what are you talking about?
Okiku, it's just a rumor.
Understand? It's just some rumor floating around.
A group, led by Mito men, along with
Satsuma and Choshu ronin... plans to assassinate Honorable
Elder li... or something.
That is ridiculous! It can't possibly be true!
With the world in a state of turmoil...
...unfounded rumors are bound to appear and be spread around.
But, if we paid attention to them all, we'd all die from worry.
Very true! I agree with you.
I hope that's the case here.
But, what if...
Just, what if...
I understand.
Sir Kisoya, your concern is that... what if Sir Tsuruchiyo... becomes one of the conspirators.
These days, those wanting to become a samurai can do so by...
...being of service to the clans of Mito,
Satsuma, or even Choshu.
Yes... that's right.
But, what's so wrong with that, then?
- What?
- Sir Kisoya, I too cannot believe... that such a thing could possibly happen right here in Edo.
But, if it were to happen, it wouldn't mean the end of the Tokugawa.
And if it happened, Sir Niiro would become an honorable figure.
It's so courageous...
It's so like him... to depend on nobody but himself.
It's a goal worth pursuing.
No! It can't be allowed!
You can't be serious! It's ridiculous!
Nowhere in this world does the child kill the parent. It's absurd!
Okiku... the truth is that
Sir Tsuruchiyo's real father is the Lord of Hikone, Himself!
So, anyway, Kojima...
Niiro is not aware of this yet?
Correct, sir.
As I informed you earlier, sir, in preparation for tomorrow...
I went to the Kamakura riverside to confirm our plans with him.
However, Niiro was nowhere to be found.
Just then, Kisoya Masagoro entered from the front, a bit hesitantly.
I immediately sought a place to hide.
A while ago, I reported that there seemed to be... a mystery regarding the close relation- ship between Niiro and Kisoya.
I became somewhat curious about that, sir.
Before long, Okiku of
Sagamiya arrived... and they discussed the incredible story which I've just reported!
I knew that I had to report here as soon as possible, sir, but...
I couldn't move until after the two of them had left!
Also, the way they were talking leads me to believe they'll visit Niiro tomorrow, to tell him the truth.
Take care of it by tonight...
Who shall we send?
We need our own men for tomorrow.
So, Sir Hoshino, perhaps you ought to contact our friends in the clan... and ask them to dispatch people unrelated to tomorrow's events.
But, if many men are running around in the middle of the night... the suspicions of the gate guards will surely be aroused.
Better to do it early in the morning... using ten or so strong swordsmen.
Please make the necessary arrangements at once, sir!
"Sir Niiro"
"Masagoro"
"This is a matter of great urgency.
"When you wake up in the morning... please come to Fukagawa.
"Please be sure to come."
It cannot be done.
Because, tomorrow, finally... will deliver the chance of a lifetime... a major event, the outcome of which only heaven knows.
Oh? I'd expected that it would get chilly...
...but this is really cold for the "Peach Observance."
If you're thieves, you must've had too much to drink!
Reveal your names!
You're all unfamiliar faces...
Which House are you from?
State your names!
Damn you!
As scheduled, at 5 a.m., the eighteen comrades gathered... in front of Atago Shrine at the top of Mt. Atago.
Then, they went to the Sakuradamon
Gates, and made themselves ready.
Sir Hoshino Kenmotsu, along with one man, assumed the vanguard.
They stationed themselves inside a nearby tea parlor.
Hagiwara Matasaburo and the six men of the First Unit, on the right... took positions by a trench near the checkpoint.
The Main Unit, on the left, waited in front of Matsudaira Osuminokami's Mansion.
It consisted of Sir Sumida Keijiro, the Sub-Leader, and six others.
To the rear of the Main Unit were three men lead by Kadowaki Shozaemon.
They stationed themselves at the side of Uesugi Mansion.
The snow, which started falling the night before, showed no signs of abating.
Would the heavens bring us fortune... or misfortune?
It usually doesn't snow this much in the morning.
It's certainly rare during an occasion like the "Peach Observance."
It sure is. By the way... have you become an officer yet, or...
No... Things don't seem to go my way.
But, soon my dreams will come true.
That's excellent, sir! I hope it happens soon!
- The entourage will come now?
- Yes, sir.
As today is March 3rd, the procession celebrates the "Peach Observance."
But, with all this snow... the Daimyo must be having a hard time.
Lady... I'll leave the money here.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Arrow ends and a circle means...
...Sir Mori, Lord of Ecchu.
I'm glad I made it in time!
No... I'm sorry that I couldn't get here sooner.
I was assaulted this morning by nine assassins, hence the delay.
I'm afraid they might have been li's men.
Are the other comrades all right?
So far so good.
However... all the Choshu men... and, except for Arimura Jizaemon... all the Satsuma men... failed to show up.
As a result... we're slightly shorthanded... and so I've been impatiently waiting for you to arrive.
My apologies.
Where should I place myself?
Just like we planned, you're with the First Unit, on the right.
To the right of the checkpoint?
I expect you to do your best.
Sir Kenmotsu... the assassins that I fought earlier... they weren't sent by you, were they?
Don't be ridiculous.
A true ronin, a starving dog... nobody can predict what he might do.
Besides... should the Mito fail to distinguish themselves... certainly, you wouldn't want the world to know.
Might as well play it safe and kill him.
Now, that's a plan that Sir Hoshino, the cold-blooded one, might consider.
Here we are, critically shorthanded!
Niiro, how dare you accuse me! It's ridiculous!
Wait! Even if you try to leave me out, I won't let you!
I've long waited for this chance to gain renown, here at the Sakurada Gates!
With strength paramount... I'll take li's head with my own hands!
I won't allow anyone to get in my way... be he friend or foe!
With you in such a frame of mind, we can all feel invincible.
Well, then... show me your prowess.
Go and behead li!
Sir Niiro!
Please, sirs! Sirs! I have a complaint against you!
Insolent fool! Get out of the way!
Receiving Sir Hoshino
Kenmotsu's signal...
...the First Unit attacks the palanquin's vanguard.
Next, they engage the rearguard.
The Main Troop storms li "Kamon- nokami" Naosuke, head on.
Damn it!
Damn it!
No, you fools!
Idiots!
Let go!
Damn you!
Open the gate!
Open the gate!
Fools! This means that Japan holds no future for the samurai!
Niiro Tsuruchiyo, a Bishu ronin...
...beheaded Elder li Naosuke, not knowing that li was his father.
However, by order of Sir Hoshino all records concerning Niiro were purged the night before.
Thus, Niiro Tsuruchiyo was never a member of our conspiracy.
However, the fact remains... that the one who took the head of Elder li... was, without a doubt, his own son...
Niiro Tsuruchiyo, himself.
Look!
I won't let this head go for less than 200-koku!
No... even 300 would be a bargain!
Look!
Here's today's paramount achievement!
Elder li's head is in the hands of a Bishu ronin,
Niiro Tsuruchiyo!
It was March 3rd, the first year of Man'en.
On the day we celebrate the "Peach
Observance," it was unusual... to see Edo cloaked in unrelenting snow.
Such were the events that transpired at the Sakurada Gates.
The End
{1415}{1500}# 'Green Leaves Of Summer'
{4939}{5031}General Houston's arrived, gentlemen.|- Refreshments?
{5035}{5105}Thank you, Doc.
{5155}{5247}71 cold, windy, rump-bumping miles...|since yesterday!
{5251}{5365}You wouldn't have it|any other way, Lightfoot.
{5754}{5828}Company, stand to!
{5898}{5942}Attention!
{5946}{6010}As you are.
{6018}{6086}{y:i}¡Don Esparza!|- ¡Mi general!
{6090}{6158}General Houston, may I|order the men to bivouac?
{6162}{6254}The forced marches took it out of them.|- Foot soldiers may.
{6258}{6302}Feed the others, care for their horses...
{6306}{6398}{y:i}...and tell them there'll be|another march within the hour.
{6402}{6422}Yes, sir! Sergeant!
{6426}{6470}Doctor.|- Sam.
{6474}{6517}Dickinson.|- General, sir.
{6521}{6637}General, it ain't none of my business,|but you ain't ate since yesterday.
{6641}{6685}I'll sit it on the table here.
{6689}{6757}Where's Jim Bowie?
{6761}{6895}When certain people ain't ate,|they're meaner than a bobcat!
{6977}{7021}Mr Dickinson...
{7025}{7106}I asked you a question.
{7169}{7213}Where's Jim Bowie?
{7217}{7261}He's indisposed, sir.
{7265}{7333}By God, if you mean drunk,|you say drunk, sir!
{7337}{7405}He's drunk, sir.
{7409}{7453}What's your name?|- James Butler Bonham.
{7457}{7541}In Travis's command, sir.
{7576}{7628}Hm.
{7696}{7784}Neill, you go north with me.
{7792}{7836}Colonel Travis will be in command here.
{7840}{7908}Major, sir.|- Colonel Travis.
{7912}{7980}I'll send the commission through.|- Thank you, General.
{7984}{8100}Let me assure you I'll do...|- We'll dispense with the amenities. Now...
{8104}{8172}I've been given command|of the armies of Texas.
{8176}{8268}But the fly in the buttermilk is|there ain't no armies in Texas!
{8272}{8340}A few good friends and some willing men.
{8344}{8412}I'm gonna have to knock|some of those men into an army...
{8416}{8460}{y:i}...and to do that I need time.
{8464}{8579}You people right here on the real ground|are gonna have to buy me that time.
{8583}{8651}You have to keep Santa Anna|off the back of my neck...
{8655}{8747}...until I can get in shape to fight him.|- So you're ordering me to...
{8751}{8843}Dammit! I am ordering you to command!|How and what you do is your problem!
{8847}{8915}But, Sam, what about Jim Bowie?
{8919}{8987}Jim Bowie, as Mr Bonham|has informed us, is indisposed.
{8991}{9059}Yes, sir. But I'd like to point out...
{9063}{9131}{y:i}...that Jim Bowie is leading|a hundred volunteers...
{9135}{9227}...whereas young Travis here|commands less than 30 regulars.
{9279}{9347}General Houston, I think|we oughta discuss this...
{9351}{9467}Clear the room! Gentlemen, I would have|a word with Mr Travis if you'll excuse us.
{9471}{9536}Con permiso.
{9782}{9898}Mr Travis, were you going to|complain to me about Jim Bowie?
{9902}{9946}Not complain, sir.
{9950}{9994}Of course Jim Bowie's drunk.
{9998}{10090}He took this town from General Cos.|He fought a battle.
{10094}{10138}And now he's drunk.
{10142}{10227}Seems kinda natural to me.
{10238}{10330}Or perhaps you question something|other than Bowie's drinking.
{10334}{10426}Are you gonna tell me that he's got|a lot of acreage around here?
{10430}{10474}That he's married into|the Mexican aristocracy?
{10478}{10521}Yes, sir.
{10525}{10569}I would trust Jim Bowie with my life.
{10573}{10641}More than that, I would trust him|with the lives of my family.
{10645}{10737}And more than that, I would trust him|with the life of Texas.
{10741}{10785}Sir.|- That's all, Travis.
{10789}{10847}Travis!
{10933}{11001}I've never been able to like you.
{11005}{11121}But you are another one of the very few|men I would trust with the life of Texas.
{11125}{11169}For that, thank you, sir.
{11173}{11241}And it may very well be...
{11245}{11361}{y:i}...that that life rests in your hands now.
{11916}{11960}Jethro! Is that you?
{11964}{12008}Yes, sir, General. This is me.
{12012}{12056}How are you still alive?
{12060}{12152}You had white hair when I was a boy|and now we look the same age.
{12156}{12200}Yes, sir.
{12204}{12320}But I've been a temperate and|God-fearing man all my life, sir.
{12324}{12414}Well, I guess my past is out!
{12420}{12511}Jethro, you tell your Mr Jim|I'm sorry to hear about his illness.
{12515}{12559}I wish him a speedy recovery.
{12563}{12631}And assure him of my undying affection.
{12635}{12655}Yes, sir.
{12659}{12727}And, General Sam, sir, he love you too.
{12731}{12823}And them words of yours|gonna put him right back on his feet.
{12827}{12871}He got a colic, you know.|- I heard.
{12875}{12919}In the stomach.
{12923}{12967}Stay temperate, old man!
{12971}{12991}Neill!
{12995}{13039}Column right! Forward!
{13043}{13100}Yo-ho!
{13139}{13209}Take care, men!
{14434}{14514}You all right, Mr Jim?
{14529}{14573}Yeah.
{14577}{14647}Sit down, Jeth.
{14817}{14871}Ohh!
{14889}{14933}Can I get you something, sir?|- No, no.
{14937}{15012}You just sit there.
{15201}{15269}Houston's gone?
{15273}{15334}Yes, sir.
{15393}{15488}Come and gone and me lying drunk.
{15704}{15804}Colonel Travis! Bowie's approaching!
{16184}{16239}Halt!
{16256}{16328}Carry on, sentry!
{16400}{16444}Recall work parties!
{16448}{16533}Prepare for flag ceremony!
{16591}{16675}Detail! Forward... march!
{17311}{17382}Present... arms!
{17550}{17618}Order... arms!
{17646}{17714}We stand here ready to do our duty...
{17718}{17810}{y:i}...and cognisant of the will of God.
{17814}{17858}Captain Dickinson!
{17862}{17906}Dismiss the ceremony!
{17910}{18026}And, Captain, inform the men that|work details will be dismissed at 4.30...
{18030}{18146}{y:i}...in order that family men may gather|their dependants within these walls.
{18150}{18211}Yes, sir!
{18366}{18410}Lieutenant Blake!|- Yes, sir!
{18414}{18482}You will see to the quartering|of Bowie's volunteers.
{18486}{18505}Yes, sir!
{18509}{18590}You men will follow me!
{18725}{18793}Jeth, Blake'll show you|to our quarters. Set 'em up.
{18797}{18858}Yes, sir.
{19469}{19536}Colonel Bowie.
{19540}{19643}Santa Anna's got an army of 7,000 men.
{19708}{19752}So?
{19756}{19848}Well, you ain't gonna try to defend|this broken-down church...
{19852}{19920}...against 7,000 battle-hard troops?
{19924}{19968}Colonel Bowie.
{19972}{20040}You were drunk at the last officers' call.
{20044}{20136}And I would rather postpone|our discussion until the next.
{20140}{20208}At which time I will explain my plans...
{20212}{20346}{y:i}...and give orders for|the implementing of those plans.
{20931}{20951}Hey, Jim!
{20955}{21023}Why do we have to work like this?
{21027}{21095}I volunteered to fight, not to build no fort.
{21099}{21143}How come we have to work like this?
{21147}{21215}Because old Sam told Travis,|Travis told me...
{21219}{21287}{y:i}...and I'm telling you!
{21291}{21437}Somebody's comin' hellbent for leather,|sinking spurs at every jump!
{21459}{21514}Halt!
{21554}{21598}Corporal of the guard!
{21602}{21666}Post No. 1!
{21674}{21766}No civilians may enter the fort,|Señor Seguin. I'm sorry.
{21770}{21838}Juan! Silverio!|Let 'em through, Dick!
{21842}{21886}Captain Dickinson!
{21890}{21910}Yes, sir.
{21914}{22006}Come to my office, please, Captain.|- Yes, sir.
{22010}{22100}Tengo noticias de Santa Anna.
{22154}{22246}Good afternoon, Colonel Travis.|We have news of Santa Anna.
{22250}{22318}My son and I have...|- Good day, Señor Seguin.
{22322}{22438}Señor, even though you're|the alcalde of San Antonio de Bexar...
{22442}{22509}{y:i}...it does not exempt you|from military prohibitions.
{22513}{22581}This establishment is closed to all civilians!
{22585}{22653}I'm very sorry, Colonel Travis.
{22657}{22725}Had I known your restrictions|applied to me and my family, sir...
{22729}{22821}Now, wait a minute, Travis!|The Seguins have news of Santa Anna.
{22825}{22893}We have a dozen rumours a day.|- You can't just...
{22897}{22965}Por favor, Juan, tell him.
{22969}{23013}Colonel, the Indians of San Blas...
{23017}{23133}{y:i}...sent couriers to the vaqueros of|my properties along the Sangre de Cristo.
{23137}{23205}They say many soldiers crossed|the Baja Diablo two days ago.
{23209}{23277}That puts 'em a lot closer than you thought.
{23281}{23373}The Indians guessed the number|of troops at over 5,000.
{23377}{23493}There are also large numbers of|mounted soldiers and supply trains.
{23497}{23588}Also, lower down on the Baja Diablo|another party of Indians saw signs...
{23592}{23684}{y:i}...of shod horses crossing a ford.|- I'm sorry, Señor Seguin.
{23688}{23780}As a civilian, you cannot realise|how worthless this information is.
{23784}{23828}'Some Indian told some vaqueros...'
{23832}{23900}Anyway, thank you, sir. Good day.
{23904}{23972}You know the Seguins|are absolutely reliable!
{23976}{24044}If you'll excuse me.|- I meant no personal offence, señor.
{24048}{24140}But I cannot make a plan|based on third-hand rumours.
{24144}{24236}I do not take personal affront,|Colonel Travis...
{24240}{24356}{y:i}...else I should be forced to act|other than to simply bid you good day.
{24360}{24438}Adiós, Juan.|- Adiós.
{24671}{24758}You're a damn fool, Travis.
{25702}{25786}A true gentleman, Seguin.
{25822}{25910}I dislike being rude to him.
{25966}{26010}Even allowing for exaggeration...
{26014}{26106}...Santa Anna must have|crossed the Baja in strength.
{26110}{26178}But I had to do it, Dick.
{26182}{26322}I'd say we have two or at best|three days before we see his banners.
{26326}{26370}The men were listening.
{26374}{26533}And I can't let that rabble know how weak|we are and how strong the enemy is.
{26565}{26657}You couldn't do that, eh?|- No, I couldn't.
{26661}{26753}My honest and truthful|and plain-spoken friend.
{26757}{26825}{y:i}You could, perhaps, but I couldn't.
{26829}{26873}Now, take a look at this.
{26877}{26921}This oblique rampart here...
{26925}{27041}Well, have sense, Dick! Why should|those men stay if they knew the truth?
{27045}{27089}It's different for Bowie, of course.
{27093}{27185}He's got a big stake in Texas.|A couple of million acres, I hear.
{27189}{27281}Some of those men haven't got...|- Have you got any dollars or acres?
{27285}{27403}I've got an extra suit of clothes.|You know that.
{27620}{27664}Boy! So that's it!
{27668}{27712}San Antonio de Bexar.
{27716}{27784}It means Saint Anthony in English.
{27788}{27889}The colonel speaks Spanish, you know.
{28004}{28086}Are you gonna pray, sir?
{28100}{28144}But why, sir?
{28148}{28240}I mean, there wasn't|no doubt we'd find her.
{28244}{28360}The colonel just wasn't sure which one|of these here creeks was the shortest cut.
{28364}{28432}He ain't been here in nigh 15 years.
{28436}{28480}Better make the signal, boy.
{28484}{28527}Yes, sir.
{28531}{28575}I hope this powder ain't damp.
{28579}{28671}You don't take it wrong|I ask you all these questions, Parson?
{28675}{28743}No, boy, that's how you learn. Asking.
{28747}{28791}Yes, sir.
{28795}{28911}So many times every day|you stop and give thanks.
{28915}{29007}Mostly I can't catch on to what|you're thanking the Lord for.
{29011}{29055}I mean, there's nothin' special.
{29059}{29103}I give thanks for the time and the place.
{29107}{29175}The time and place, Parson?
{29179}{29271}A time to live and a place to die.|That's all any man gets.
{29275}{29319}No more, no less.
{29323}{29418}Fire the signal, boy.|- Yes, sir.
{29706}{29793}Must be Parson and the boy!
{29826}{29887}Think so!
{30953}{31021}Well, there she be, Colonel!
{31025}{31069}After 20 days of hard ridin'!
{31073}{31141}We gonna have to learn|the lingo they use down here, Davy?
{31145}{31237}Where do we go, Davy?|To the town or to the fort?
{31241}{31285}There's no fort. It's an old mission.
{31289}{31405}You better take a better look.|A lot of people movin' in there.
{31409}{31477}Them guns don't give it|no mission look to me.
{31481}{31524}Colonel...
{31528}{31616}What do C-A-N-T-I-N-A spell?
{31648}{31740}Cantina. Do it mean what I think it do?|- It do.
{31744}{31870}It means out of these deerskins|and into our foofaraw!
{32200}{32278}Hey, you got my coat!
{32583}{32603}Hey, Pedro!
{32607}{32651}Hand me down that guitar.
{32655}{32747}Now I want you folks to all|clump in here close together.
{32751}{32819}I want you Texicans to open up your ears...
{32823}{32937}{y:i}...and listen to a little pure Tennessee.
{32943}{32987}# Here's to the ladies...
{32991}{33035}# I love 'em all...
{33039}{33131}# Here's to the ones I recall...
{33135}{33179}# Here's to the ladies...
{33183}{33227}# Married or free...
{33231}{33299}# They all look pretty good to me...
{33303}{33347}# The big and small ones...
{33351}{33395}# The short and tall ones...
{33399}{33443}# Each one a lovely...
{33447}{33502}Halt!
{33542}{33562}# Here's to the ladies...
{33566}{33634}# I love the ladies...
{33638}{33706}Captain Dickinson, split your patrol.
{33710}{33802}Send half each way down the river for|about five miles to look for any signs.
{33806}{33874}Then report back to the mission.|- Yes, sir.
{33878}{33948}Forward! Yo-ho!
{34645}{34689}Sorry, sir!
{34693}{34771}She sorta come loose!
{34813}{34877}I'd like...
{34885}{34977}I'd like to speak to David Crockett.|- You did.
{34981}{35049}That was David Crockett from Tennessee?
{35053}{35145}Yes, sir. And I oughta know.|Me and him's neighbours back home.
{35149}{35217}Only live 40 mile apart.
{35221}{35288}Colonel Davy!
{35437}{35504}Are you David Crockett, sir?|- That's my name.
{35508}{35576}I'm Colonel Travis,|commanding the garrison.
{35580}{35600}I figured.
{35604}{35711}Well, son, you'd better start growing up.
{35772}{35840}I'd like to speak to you|on a matter of gravest importance.
{35844}{35929}Sure. Let's find a corner.
{35988}{36063}Talking's dry work!
{36204}{36282}You're learnin' fast!
{36348}{36392}Colonel!
{36396}{36440}I'm resignin' from you.
{36444}{36535}I'm gonna marry up with Conchita|and be the man of this house.
{36539}{36583}Bésame a kiss, señorita.
{36587}{36655}I toss around a mess|of that proud Spanish, too.
{36659}{36703}Most important part.
{36707}{36797}Let's jig a little, mamacita.
{36827}{36895}Light there and rest easy, Travis...
{36899}{36967}...while I bed down this buck.
{36971}{37074}He just ain't got no head for whiskey!
{37091}{37135}Parson!|- Yeah, Davy!
{37139}{37224}Take him away.|- Yes, sir!
{37355}{37423}Let's wet our whistles.
{37427}{37471}Words are dusty.
{37475}{37542}I don't drink.
{37546}{37614}Not ever?|- No.
{37618}{37686}I've heard of such.
{37690}{37734}Well, spread your wampum, Travis.
{37738}{37782}My title is colonel.
{37786}{37854}Me, I'm a colonel, too.
{37858}{37926}Wouldn't it sound kinda silly,|chattering colonel, colonel...
{37930}{37998}{y:i}...like a couple of marsh shield birds?
{38002}{38070}Just speak right up and call me Crockett.
{38074}{38118}Don't bother to use my title.
{38122}{38238}Old drunken General Flatford gave it|to me in the Choctaw Indian War.
{38242}{38320}I'll call you Travis.
{38410}{38478}Very well, Crockett.
{38482}{38573}I'd like your permission|to make a speech to your men.
{38577}{38669}Well, they've heard many a speech|while I was congressifying.
{38673}{38717}What would you talk about?
{38721}{38811}Oh, about freedom... liberty.
{38817}{38885}Well, they don't need any such speech.
{38889}{38957}These men are from Tennessee.
{38961}{39101}I'd like to explain why I want them|to volunteer to fight against Santa Anna.
{39105}{39157}Oh?
{39225}{39293}Not so careless!
{39297}{39418}You can't get new clothes|this side of Nacogdoches.
{39441}{39495}Tag!
{39560}{39652}Tennesseans ain't exactly against fighting...
{39656}{39772}{y:i}...but they ain't much for listening|to speeches. What would you tell them?
{39776}{39868}Of the many and unendurable hardships|the people have been subjected to...
{39872}{39988}...under the tyrannical government|of this military dictator Santa Anna.
{39992}{40060}We have no rights in the courts,|no market for our produce.
{40064}{40156}He has forbidden trade with the North.
{40160}{40204}Davy!
{40208}{40276}I want a chance for my money back.
{40280}{40372}Why don't you leave Davy alone?|He done beat you 38 times hand-runnin'!
{40519}{40587}This'll only take a minute, Travis.
{40591}{40659}Give me them feathers.
{40663}{40725}Gentlemen.
{40783}{40863}Balance your feathers.
{40903}{40968}Get set! Go!
{41455}{41570}Gotcha that time, Davy.|- It was fair and square.
{41574}{41666}If we can continue, I would like to say...|- One minute, Travis.
{41670}{41714}That was just for who gets first chance.
{41718}{41822}Prepare yourself, Davy.|- I'm prepared.
{41838}{41906}He's still on his feet!
{41910}{41930}Oh, no!
{41934}{42002}Oh, yes!|- Oh, yes!
{42006}{42078}And it's my turn!
{42294}{42410}He'll never learn!|Let's get a bucket of water.
{42414}{42482}Kind of a game the boys play|back in Tennessee.
{42486}{42577}Even though time is running out,|I must postpone this interview...
{42581}{42649}...until we can be assured|of no interruptions.
{42653}{42819}Step down off your high horse, mister.|You don't get lard less'n you boil the hog.
{42893}{42961}Have one of these cigars.
{42965}{43075}I brought 'em all the way from New Orleans.
{43085}{43153}Were you going to tell my Tennesseans...
{43157}{43201}{y:i}...that a good many men...
{43205}{43249}...sound men all...
{43253}{43345}{y:i}...had a plot to ease the suffering|of the people in these parts?
{43349}{43441}Or were you going to tell them|that Steve Austin, Houston and others...
{43445}{43584}{y:i}...and you too, Travis, had planned|to declare for a republic?
{43588}{43656}To declare this the Republic of Texas?
{43660}{43761}Were you gonna tell 'em that, Travis?
{43780}{43848}I hadn't thought this was generally known.
{43852}{43896}It isn't yet.
{43900}{44016}Not till Austin separates|the sheep from the goats.
{44020}{44112}Not till he decides who's on the right side.
{44116}{44160}Republic.
{44164}{44208}I like the sound of the word.
{44212}{44280}It means people can live free...
{44284}{44328}{y:i}...talk free...
{44332}{44376}{y:i}...go or come, buy or sell...
{44380}{44448}{y:i}...be drunk or sober.|However they choose.
{44452}{44519}Some words give you a feeling.
{44523}{44591}Republic is one of those words that...
{44595}{44663}...makes me tight in the throat.
{44667}{44735}Same tightness a man gets when his...
{44739}{44807}{y:i}...baby takes his first step or...
{44811}{44879}{y:i}...his first baby shaves...
{44883}{44975}{y:i}...and makes his first sound like a man.
{44979}{45115}Some words can give you a feeling|that makes your heart warm.
{45123}{45216}Republic is one of those words.
{45363}{45424}Crockett!
{45483}{45550}I have, I believe, learned|two things about you.
{45554}{45598}Worthwhile, I hope.
{45602}{45718}You're not the illiterate country bumpkin|you would have people believe.
{45722}{45814}You speak an excellent and|concise English when you wish.
{45818}{45862}The... uh... bad grammar is a pose.
{45866}{46030}A fella has to do a lot to get elected to|Congress. I've kissed many a baby, too.
{46034}{46150}The other is that you came|to Texas to fight with us.
{46154}{46222}Don't tell my Tennesseans that.
{46226}{46342}They think we came south|to hunt and... get drunk.
{46346}{46413}Whoo-hoo-hoo!
{46442}{46555}They... uh... seem|to have accomplished that.
{49319}{49411}Good evening, my almost-vanishing lady.
{49415}{49483}Puedes irte, Juan.|- Sí, Señor Sand.
{49487}{49530}{y:i}Trae el equipaje.
{49534}{49602}Incredible! I arranged for this carriage...
{49606}{49674}I would be heartbroken|if you left Bexar just now.
{49678}{49746}Even more so if you left|with my team of horses...
{49750}{49818}...which would bring|a pretty penny in these times...
{49822}{49949}{y:i}...with two factions|buying anything on four legs.
{50326}{50370}Do you have business here?
{50374}{50418}I promised Mother.
{50422}{50466}Your mother?
{50470}{50537}Pray to the North Star.|Ten minutes every night.
{50541}{50635}A long line of star-worshippers.
{50661}{50729}It keeps the rheumatiz away.
{50733}{50801}It seems to me you're looking for trouble.
{50805}{50862}It do?
{50949}{51041}Let's go upstairs. Unless you prefer|discussing your business...
{51045}{51113}{y:i}...in front of every drunken loafer in Bexar.
{51117}{51184}Ándala, pues!
{51453}{51496}I suppose that overdressed ignoramus...
{51500}{51568}{y:i}...is one of the riffraff|here to resist Santa Anna.
{51572}{51688}They'll find graves and nothing else.|Santa Anna will sweep across...
{51692}{51760}Overdressed?|I paid good money for these clothes.
{51764}{51818}Why?
{52052}{52122}Lady's luggage.
{52388}{52432}Gratuity for the boy. You forgot.
{52436}{52494}Dinero.
{52747}{52847}Son, I guess he isn't gonna tip you.
{53155}{53199}Another thing I promised Mother.
{53203}{53319}Never to get in situations|where people pointed guns at me.
{53323}{53367}Ma'am, it is possible that I am mistaken...
{53371}{53463}{y:i}...but it seems to me you find this|gentleman's company distasteful.
{53467}{53510}Tell him to get out.
{53514}{53606}Thank you, sir, but there is no way|in which you could be of help.
{53610}{53734}And I am in no danger.|- I bid you good night, ma'am.
{53778}{53856}Gratuity for the boy.
{54018}{54093}Your property, sir.
{54186}{54261}Muchísimas gracias!
{54737}{54829}We are guaranteed the protection|of the generalissimo himself.
{54833}{54901}Ah, but please don't misunderstand me.
{54905}{54949}{y:i}I don't want all of your lands.
{54953}{55021}Half will be sufficient for me.|I'm no glutton.
{55025}{55117}{y:i}¡Tú eres el más digno|descendiente de la liga de fuerzas!
{55121}{55165}{y:i}¡El más bajo de los cobardes!
{55169}{55237}{y:i}¿Pero cómo es posible que|tengas tan poca dignidad?
{55241}{55309}{y:i}¿Cómo es posible que tengas|tan poca vergüenza?
{55313}{55429}Easy, Graciela, easy! I speak your|language, but that's too fast for me.
{55433}{55524}Though I dare say|I'm better off not understanding.
{55528}{55572}You actually wanted me to agree to this?
{55576}{55644}This atrocity?!
{55648}{55716}I actually did and I actually do.
{55720}{55812}You're an educated woman, Graciela.|Intelligent.
{55816}{55884}Is there any other way|to restore your family properties?
{55888}{55993}Santa Anna's administrators rule Potosí.
{56008}{56052}You... you expect me to marry you...
{56056}{56196}{y:i}...with my father and four brothers newly|buried in Potosí... and my husband?
{56200}{56268}I expect it because it is the logical course.
{56272}{56316}To marry you? Logical?!
{56320}{56364}Of course!
{56368}{56412}I am acceptable to Santa Anna.
{56416}{56531}If he should be defeated, I will manage|to become acceptable to his successors.
{56535}{56579}Oh...
{56583}{56699}That's the trick. To be acceptable|to the powers that be.
{56703}{56771}Let's not pretend|you're a broken-hearted widow.
{56775}{56819}You barely knew the man.
{56823}{56915}The marriage was as much arranged|as this one would be.
{56919}{57011}Your family picked him up.|- That's the way of my people.
{57015}{57035}You'll say yes.
{57039}{57129}It's your only possible path.
{57135}{57203}Like all women,|you'll postpone the decision.
{57207}{57285}But you will say yes.
{58334}{58426}Forgive me, ma'am, but I was|having a smoke out on that gallery...
{58430}{58521}{y:i}...and I couldn't help but overhear...|I wasn't eavesdropping.
{58525}{58665}But it rankles me when somebody tries|to force somebody to do something.
{58669}{58785}You haven't seen me before tonight,|but I am offering you my services.
{58789}{58857}If that fella's making you stay in Bexar...
{58861}{58929}{y:i}...I'm ready, willing and able|to provide you...
{58933}{58977}{y:i}...a transport to wherever you wanna go.
{58981}{59073}And on the other hand,|if you choose to stay in Bexar...
{59077}{59223}{y:i}...I'm ready, willing and able|to see that he don't bother you.
{59245}{59361}Would you answer one question with|complete honesty, Mr... Tall American?
{59365}{59433}Ma'am, only modesty|restrains me from telling you...
{59437}{59552}{y:i}...that I am widely known|for my truthfulness.
{59556}{59696}Would you so quickly offer to defend me|if I were 60 years old and wrinkled?
{59700}{59768}Or is it because I am young and a widow...
{59772}{59898}{y:i}...and you are far from home|and your loved ones?
{59964}{60051}But thank you, anyway, sir.
{60084}{60128}In any event...
{60132}{60248}{y:i}...this is a matter in which|no outsider could help.
{60252}{60320}Mr Tall American!
{60324}{60440}I do believe that a woman in trouble,|even though 60 and wrinkled...
{60444}{60535}...could turn to you for help.
{60539}{60613}Good night, ma'am.
{61307}{61369}¡Adelante!
{62266}{62318}Ha!
{62482}{62525}Well, thanks, friend!
{62529}{62621}If you don't insist on having them|to yourself, I'll give you a hand.
{62625}{62697}Pleasure, friend.
{62721}{62813}You must be Jim Bowie.|The size and the shape is as described...
{62817}{62885}{y:i}...and this knife is certainly|everything I heard it was.
{62889}{62957}I'm Bowie.|- I'm Davy Crockett.
{62961}{63029}Well! I've heard a lot about you!
{63033}{63101}I've heard a lot about you, too.
{63105}{63149}I'd admire to buy you a drink,|or eight or ten.
{63153}{63224}Oh... Excuse me.
{63249}{63317}Did you have some trouble with Emil Sand?
{63321}{63365}Who's Emil Sand?|- Merchant.
{63369}{63437}Tall fella? Butter-coloured hair?|- That's him.
{63441}{63508}I've had some words with him.|Intend to have some more.
{63512}{63580}How about that drink?|- Honoured, Congressman Crockett!
{63584}{63727}Please, Jim! Don't call me that!|I've been trying to live it down.
{64136}{64204}Here's your extra coat, Davy. And a jug.
{64208}{64276}Thoughtful. You'd better|get some sleep, Smitty.
{64280}{64324}I'm not tired.
{64328}{64372}It's Mexico. Exciting night.
{64376}{64444}Yeah, well, you'd still better get some sleep.
{64448}{64515}All right, Davy.
{64519}{64539}Night, Smitty.
{64543}{64638}Good night, Colonel Bowie... Jim.
{64735}{64803}Took a long time for|this night to get unexciting.
{64807}{64872}It sure did.
{64879}{64947}'Tis a mighty pretty one though.
{64951}{65043}I understand you moved down here|lock, stock, and barrel, Jim.
{65047}{65163}I didn't plan on moving.|Came for a visit and stayed.
{65167}{65259}I gather you like it.|- Oh, Davy! If you only knew Mexico!
{65263}{65307}It's wonderful!
{65311}{65403}I thought she was a burnt-over|desert most of the time.
{65407}{65498}Nah... Most northerners|think that. It ain't so.
{65502}{65570}Big valleys between high mountains.
{65574}{65666}Just everything a man could want|in the way of country.
{65670}{65774}For looking at or... or for growing on.
{65790}{65834}But mostly...
{65838}{65906}Mostly it's the people, Davy.
{65910}{65974}They got...
{65982}{66026}This is kinda hard to explain, but...
{66030}{66122}{y:i}...they got courage and they got dignity.
{66126}{66194}They ain't afraid to die.
{66198}{66314}What seems most important to me|is that they ain't afraid to live.
{66318}{66458}Today is important to them,|not the dollar tomorrow might bring.
{66462}{66529}I suppose the Yankee says that's lazy.
{66533}{66626}Me? I say it's a way of livin'.
{66653}{66697}And the womenfolk!
{66701}{66745}Well, Davy...
{66749}{66817}I figured you favoured the Mexican ladies.
{66821}{66889}They tell me you married one.
{66893}{66937}Yeah, I... uh...
{66941}{66998}I did.
{67013}{67075}I... uh...
{67085}{67129}Well, Davy, I...
{67133}{67297}I just ain't got, you know, your way|of putting things into... into words, but...
{67301}{67378}I got a fine family.
{67397}{67441}A wonderful wife and...
{67445}{67525}{y:i}...two fine boys.
{67540}{67632}I guess I'm what you'd call a lucky man.
{67636}{67728}Now, that ain't a bad stab|at putting it into words.
{67732}{67891}I, uh, sent them up to Coahuila with|all the trouble around here, you know...
{67948}{68016}May I speak privately with you, sir?|- Sure, but...
{68020}{68088}Aren't you Señora de López?|- Señor Bowie, I'm sorry.
{68092}{68184}I did not recognise you.|- This place ain't fit for...
{68188}{68232}I know. But the matter is urgent.
{68236}{68304}Could I have a few private words|with this gentleman?
{68308}{68352}Sure. Excuse me.
{68356}{68400}I'll be inside, Crockett.
{68404}{68465}Crockett?
{68476}{68519}You are the famous David Crockett?
{68523}{68567}Well, I'm Crockett.
{68571}{68687}They named me Davy after an uncle|that didn't leave Pa the farm after all.
{68691}{68831}Mr Crockett, shortly after you left my|room I heard an altercation in the street.
{68835}{68927}I could hear the sound,|though I could not see from my window.
{68931}{68975}It sounded like a drunken brawl.
{68979}{69047}Well, sittin' right here I didn't hear a thing.
{69051}{69143}Well, anyway, I saw lights|in the old church...
{69147}{69215}{y:i}...and people moving about.|And one of them was Emil.
{69219}{69263}And... a thought came to me.
{69267}{69335}As you may know,|Colonel Travis has ordered...
{69339}{69431}{y:i}...all powder and ball|from the merchants of Bexar.
{69435}{69502}And he didn't find any at Emil's warehouse.
{69506}{69646}It's my opinion... it's all hidden|in the basement of that church.
{69650}{69694}And... Mr Crockett...
{69698}{69814}The defenders of Texas are going to|need that powder against Santa Anna.
{69818}{69910}And you're against Santa Anna?|- Bitterly. Of course.
{69914}{69958}And this... uh... Emil? He's for him?
{69962}{70006}Yes, he is.
{70010}{70078}Then, how did he figure you'd marry him?
{70082}{70150}Political arguments|don't flavour folks' supper.
{70154}{70270}Nevertheless, I am going to marry him.|Please let's not discuss it, Mr Crockett.
{70274}{70342}The name is Davy,|and I couldn't sleep nights...
{70346}{70414}Will you say goodbye for me to Mr Bowie?
{70418}{70462}Well, I...|- I can make my own way...
{70466}{70580}{y:i}...and I hope the information is helpful.
{70945}{70989}Something interesting, Jim.
{70993}{71109}Parson, round up a couple of the men,|fairly sober, and meet us out in the street.
{71113}{71181}Where are we goin'?
{71185}{71269}The church.|- Yeah, Davy.
{71449}{71493}Hey!
{71497}{71555}Parson!
{71568}{71684}Why'd you run off without me?|- I told him to stay behind. He's drunk.
{71688}{71756}Stick to the point.|Why'd you run off without me?
{71760}{71804}Jim, this is Beekeeper. Jim Bowie.
{71808}{71852}Hi.|- You can come along.
{71856}{71996}But hold your breath. Can they smell,|they'll be warned you're coming.
{72000}{72062}Excuse me.
{72527}{72609}Grab that torch.|- Yeah.
{72815}{72877}Excuse me.
{73510}{73554}Well! Here, Parson.
{73558}{73619}Yes, sir.
{73774}{73862}Rifles.|- Must be 50 of 'em!
{73918}{73962}Pólvora.|- That's gunpowder.
{73966}{74034}Let me take a look at that stuff.|- Watch it!
{74038}{74143}Stand back and stand still.|- Excuse me.
{74158}{74226}There must be a ton of it.
{74230}{74322}I'm sure gonna be looking forward|to seeing that soldier boy's face...
{74326}{74417}{y:i}...when we bring this in.
{76939}{77007}It's a beautiful morning, Davy Crockett.
{77011}{77078}It is that...
{77083}{77127}...María de López y Vejar.
{77131}{77175}My goodness! You remember all that?
{77179}{77295}Sure. I'm not as stupid|as I look from the outside.
{77299}{77367}What's Spanish for breakfast?|- Desayuno.
{77371}{77439}Let's take a paseado out|and get some desayuno.
{77443}{77510}Paseado?|- That means 'walk'.
{77514}{77582}That means 'have walked'.|But never mind. I'll get dressed.
{77586}{77654}Wait a minute.
{77658}{77702}First, write me a letter.
{77706}{77750}A letter?
{77754}{77836}In Spanish.|- Of course.
{77850}{77918}To whom is the letter addressed?
{77922}{77990}To the Honorable Davy Crockett Esquire.
{77994}{78062}You wish a letter written to yourself?|- Yep.
{78066}{78134}To the Honorable Davy Crockett Esquire...
{78138}{78254}...former Congressman of|the United States of America.
{78258}{78328}Esteemed sir...
{78426}{78500}Hurry it up there!
{78665}{78781}Seen Davy?|- Ain't nobody seen Davy. He ain't about.
{78785}{78890}First lie you've told today, Thimblerig.
{78905}{78949}Mornin', Davy!|- Howdy!
{78953}{78997}Say, Davy, what kind|of a load you got there?
{79001}{79069}Presents for some friends.
{79073}{79145}Let's go, Parson!
{79672}{79716}Halt! Who goes there?
{79720}{79764}Is that you, Bob?
{79768}{79836}Why, sure. Can't you see?
{79840}{79956}Then what kind of idiot nonsense|is this 'Who goes there'?
{79960}{80028}Well, Travis - Colonel Travis, that is -|he says that I should...
{80032}{80192}I don't care what Travis said. Open|the gate before I shoot you off that wall!
{80272}{80377}Sentry! Open the gate for Colonel Bowie!
{80631}{80699}Near a ton of good powder here, men!|Get it unloaded!
{80703}{80771}That long one there, he's Davy Crockett.
{80775}{80867}And three of his good men.|- Colonel Crockett.
{80871}{80915}Hello, Travis.
{80919}{80963}Looks like the answer to a prayer.
{80967}{81083}Colonel, I'd be pleased if you'd join me|in my quarters for some refreshment.
{81087}{81148}Proud to.
{81159}{81270}Oh, and you too,|Colonel Bowie, if you will.
{81495}{81562}I'm a stranger around these here parts.
{81566}{81634}What do you Texicans use|for drinkin' whiskey?
{81638}{81756}Drinkin' whiskey.|- You got manners or ain't you?
{81806}{81898}Captain Dickinson,|this is Colonel Davy Crockett.
{81902}{81946}Morning, Dick.
{81950}{82018}Oh, and this is my cousin Mrs Dickinson.
{82022}{82066}Colonel Crockett.|- Colonel Bowie.
{82070}{82138}Well, it's nice meeting you,|Davy Crockett.
{82142}{82186}I feel as if I know you already.
{82190}{82258}You see, part of my family|come from Tennessee...
{82262}{82378}{y:i}...and, well, your name is a household|word there. At least in our house it was.
{82382}{82450}Thank you, ma'am.|It's nice to be well thought of.
{82454}{82539}Mommy.|- Oh, yes, darling!
{82549}{82617}Oh! I've asked you|not to climb those stairs alone.
{82621}{82713}Well, who's this?|- You say hello to Colonel Crockett?
{82717}{82761}Hello.
{82765}{82833}Every size they get to|seems to be the most lovable.
{82837}{82927}Will you gentlemen excuse me?
{82933}{82977}Goodbye, Colonel.
{82981}{83025}Goodbye.
{83029}{83097}Kind of a shame|kids have to grow up into people.
{83101}{83214}It's good we're all here, gentlemen.|A cigar?
{83269}{83313}Please, make yourselves comfortable.
{83317}{83409}I have some news.|Fannin is doing well at Goliad.
{83413}{83457}He has mustered almost a thousand men...
{83461}{83552}{y:i}...and should be ready to move south|by the first of the week.
{83556}{83624}A thousand? It don't seem possible.
{83628}{83696}It does sound too good to be true,|I must confess.
{83700}{83744}But we can only admit|our doubts to each other.
{83748}{83840}In the privacy of a room|and not in front of the men.
{83844}{83960}As far as the volunteers are concerned,|we're sure Fannin has a thousand men.
{83964}{84032}I got a reputation for truth, Travis.|- I ain't.
{84036}{84104}Everybody says I'm a born liar.
{84108}{84224}But whether we talk out loud or quiet|don't seem to me the point right now.
{84228}{84320}The point is how many men has Fannin|and will he get here in time?
{84324}{84440}Whether he does or doesn't,|we'll be trapped here. And for no reason.
{84444}{84511}We should burn all of Bexar,|including this mission.
{84515}{84607}And annoy Santa Anna while he sweeps|north across the whole of Texas?
{84611}{84679}That's Colonel Bowie's theory!|- We could hit and run!
{84683}{84727}Jump him at every creek crossing...
{84731}{84799}You seem to forget one thing, Colonel!|That I command!
{84803}{84916}And I have already|decided against your plan!
{84947}{84991}Now...
{84995}{85039}Let us attack a more important problem.
{85043}{85111}Colonel Crockett's Tennesseans.
{85115}{85159}Will they fight, Colonel?
{85163}{85279}Last time I saw 'em they hadn't shown|any strong feelings against fighting.
{85283}{85375}Can you persuade them to come here?|- I can ask them.
{85379}{85471}And you're a very persuasive man|according to your reputation.
{85475}{85566}Build up the story that Fannin has|a thousand... no, two thousand men.
{85570}{85662}Play down the size of Santa Anna's...|- We've been through this.
{85666}{85734}He wants me to lie to my men, too.|Keep 'em here with lies.
{85738}{85830}Let the truth of Santa Anna's strength|be known and there won't be a dozen left!
{85834}{85926}You calling my boys cowards?|- Let us dispense with the pyrotechnics!
{85930}{86022}Remember this. My men are volunteers!|They're here because they wanna be!
{86026}{86155}But there's nothing to keep 'em|from gettin' outta here!
{86170}{86262}I'm aware that your men are militia.
{86266}{86310}And, like all volunteers, undisciplined.
{86314}{86396}Good day, Colonel Bowie.
{86577}{86717}Last night gave you a pretty good idea|of the discipline of my men.
{86721}{86813}Our position here is desperate.
{86817}{86954}And I feel sure that where Crockett leads|his men will follow.
{86961}{87005}Yeah.
{87009}{87139}That's a responsibility that's...|been kinda worrying me.
{87249}{87317}Thank you, gentlemen.|I'm gonna pass the word around.
{87321}{87413}What you Texans use for|drinkin' whiskey... is drinkin' whiskey.
{87417}{87508}And what's more important,|you got real good manners...
{87512}{87652}...seein' how you suffer the handicap|of having never been in Tennessee.
{87656}{87748}Davy, is it true that you fit|a four-day fight with Mike Fink?
{87752}{87820}Why, that's a blasted lie!
{87824}{87916}One of them stories|loose-mouthed people tell around.
{87920}{87964}Mike and me quit at sundown!
{87968}{88060}Wouldn't have been the fourth day|until, uh... next morning.
{88064}{88084}See you, men!
{88088}{88165}Let her rip, Parson!
{88615}{88659}Señora López.
{88663}{88707}Don Juan, this is Mr Davy Crockett.
{88711}{88755}I'm honoured.|- How do you do?
{88759}{88875}Señor Seguin is the alcalde... I mean,|the mayor of San Antonio de Bexar.
{88879}{88923}He's got a pretty busy town.
{88927}{88995}People are running like sheep|that have smelled a wolf pack.
{88999}{89067}I never said no such a thing!
{89071}{89187}When us took that powder in there, that|fella Travis asked if us Tennesseans...
{89191}{89259}{y:i}...was gonna join up with him. That's all.
{89263}{89331}He never asked us to fight his fight for him.
{89335}{89403}Have some breakfast.|- Breakfast?! Tortillas?
{89407}{89465}Tamale!
{89526}{89594}Never get burnt drinking this stuff.
{89598}{89690}Well, I only know part of Texas and|none of these Texicans is related to me...
{89694}{89762}{y:i}...so why should I fight for them?
{89766}{89834}Right. Ain't our ox that's gettin' gored.
{89838}{89930}Talkin' about whose ox|gets gored... figure this.
{89934}{90050}A fella gets in the habit of goring oxes,|whets his appetite.
{90054}{90122}He may come up north next|and gore yours.
{90126}{90226}Men, we're in a little fix, sort of.
{90246}{90338}The he-bull around here -|General Santa Anna. He's mad at us.
{90342}{90386}Yeah?
{90390}{90434}He's wrote us a letter.
{90438}{90482}I can't read it. It's in Spanish.
{90486}{90568}But the young lady will.
{90797}{90913}It is addressed to Davy Crockett and|the Tennesseans who accompany him.
{90917}{90961}Be it known:
{90965}{91057}You are interlopers in a country where|you are neither wanted nor welcome.
{91061}{91129}This is the order you are given.
{91133}{91225}Depart with all haste and at once,|because it has come to our attention...
{91229}{91345}{y:i}...that you are possibly considering joining|the rebels now skulking in the mission.
{91349}{91441}This is not your fight. Depart.
{91445}{91536}Should you fail to abide by this order...
{91540}{91608}{y:i}...I shall chastise you even unto death.
{91612}{91733}Signed: Generalissimo|Antonio Miguel de Santa Anna.
{91756}{91800}Huh!
{91804}{91872}Fella kinda fancies himself, don't he?
{91876}{91944}Sure does have a big-sounding name.
{91948}{92040}Givin' us orders. Who do he think he am?|Andy by God Jackson?
{92044}{92160}Riles me when somebody tells me|to go here or I can't go there.
{92164}{92208}I ain't never been run out of no place!
{92212}{92304}Except the time my old paw|kicked me over every acre...
{92308}{92376}{y:i}...of that half-section back there in Ohio.
{92380}{92448}But I was just a shirt-tail kid then.|My paw had big feet.
{92452}{92519}What do you say, Davy?|Are we gonna let this man...
{92523}{92591}{y:i}...tell us what we can or can't do?
{92595}{92731}Davy, maybe we'd better saddle up|and pay this fella a visit.
{92763}{92855}Do chastise mean what I think it do?|- It do.
{92859}{92975}Davy, let's do saddle up and go learn|that gentleman his manners.
{92979}{93095}We won't have to. He's wearin' out|horses comin' toward us.
{93099}{93167}Well, I guess we can't|stop him from coming.
{93171}{93239}But I reckon we can arrange|for him to limp going back.
{93243}{93359}I was thinking these Texicans|wasn't as neighbourly as they might be.
{93363}{93455}But here they've gone and arranged|a nice fight for us visitors.
{93459}{93550}One thing I oughta tell you.|Santa Anna never wrote that letter.
{93554}{93598}{y:i}I did.
{93602}{93670}Or rather... I had this lady here write it.
{93674}{93766}I was figuring how to tell you fellas|about this Texican hoedown.
{93770}{93886}I wondered what Santa Anna would've|said to us if he'd had a chance to say it.
{93890}{93958}Davy, I ain't never said|I ain't been whupped. I have.
{93962}{94054}But I give every one of them fellas|a chance to dig in and get the job done.
{94058}{94150}But I ain't never took nobody's word|that they was gonna chas...
{94154}{94222}Chastise.|- Chastise. Much obliged.
{94226}{94294}We're gonna stay, ain't we?|- I'm thinking it over.
{94298}{94366}What is there to think about?|You getting that old?
{94370}{94414}The man toed the mark and dared us!
{94418}{94509}Chastise, he said!|- That's right! Chastise!
{94513}{94581}But I wrote the letter!|- Don't you start weaslin'.
{94585}{94701}You said them'd be the words he'd write|if he was to write us a letter.
{94705}{94749}Well, gentlemen, you've convinced me.
{94753}{94797}We'll fight.
{94801}{94893}That's more like it!|- Now you're talkin', Davy!
{94897}{94941}First, the young lady and I|will take a pasear.
{94945}{95037}Gather up your possibles|and I'll meet up with you later.
{95041}{95148}Con permiso.|- Your Spanish is improving.
{95185}{95253}It kinda cheers me to see|the colonel with that lady.
{95257}{95349}Last couple of years he had me worried.
{95353}{95445}Lately he ain't been looking|at the girls like he was starved.
{95449}{95562}Being in Congress|has ruined many a good man.
{95712}{95780}All I hear is Crockett the bear-killer...
{95784}{95852}Crockett the Indian-fighter...
{95856}{95900}Crockett the brawler...
{95904}{95948}Crockett has brains.
{95952}{96020}Kept it hidden a number of years.
{96024}{96092}You like my Tennesseans, Flaca?|- Oh, yes.
{96096}{96188}Could strain 10,000|and never come up with 23 better.
{96192}{96308}Every one of those men has been|at my elbow, save the boy Smitty...
{96312}{96380}{y:i}...when some difficulty arose.
{96384}{96499}Some of them don't bathe as often|as polite folks would think necessary.
{96503}{96610}But every one of them smells sweet to me.
{96623}{96739}And I was the one that said|this country was burnt-over sand.
{96743}{96811}It's green and growing.
{96815}{96923}Like those green pastures they talk about.
{96935}{97038}Lord above! That's one beautiful tree!
{97606}{97650}This tree must've been growed...
{97654}{97790}...before man put his first|dirty footprints on this prairie.
{97846}{97963}Kind of a tree Adam and Eve|must have met under.
{98134}{98202}You know something, Flaca?
{98206}{98250}I guess I saw who knows how many trees...
{98254}{98346}...before I ever took|a long, thoughtful look at one.
{98350}{98512}Mostly I looked at a tree to see was there|a bear in it or an Indian behind it.
{98517}{98609}Davy, what's going to happen to us?
{98613}{98681}I mean, to you and me.
{98685}{98753}I'm gonna tell you something, Flaca,|and I want you to listen tight.
{98757}{98849}It may sound like I'm talking about me,|but I'm talkin' about you.
{98853}{98921}In fact, I'm talking about|all people everywhere.
{98925}{99017}When I came down here to Texas,|I was looking for something.
{99021}{99089}I didn't know what.
{99093}{99137}It seems like you added up my life...
{99141}{99281}{y:i}...and I'd spent it all either stomping other|men or in some cases getting stomped.
{99285}{99353}Had me some money|and had me some medals.
{99357}{99473}But none of it seemed a lifetime|worth the pain of the mother that bore me.
{99477}{99520}It's like I was empty.
{99524}{99568}Well, I'm not empty any more.
{99572}{99640}That's what's important.
{99644}{99688}To feel useful in this old world.
{99692}{99808}To hit a lick against what's wrong,|or to say a word for what's right...
{99812}{99904}{y:i}...even though you get walloped|for sayin' that word.
{99908}{100000}I may sound like a Bible-beater|yellin' up a revival at a camp meeting...
{100004}{100072}{y:i}...but that don't change the truth none.
{100076}{100144}There's right and there's wrong.|You gotta do one or the other.
{100148}{100216}You do the one and you're living.
{100220}{100383}You do the other and you may be walking|around, but you're dead as a beaver hat.
{100436}{100551}I'd hoped for a horse, but there's|nothing wrong with a good strong mule.
{100555}{100617}My things!
{100627}{100671}All my luggage is in the buggy!
{100675}{100719}Had my men take care of it.
{100723}{100850}Your geegaws may be rough-packed|but they're all there.
{100963}{101055}You are sending me away. You...
{101059}{101175}You talked about the fight|against evil but you...
{101179}{101247}You are sending me to safety.
{101251}{101319}Flaca, you have an important name.
{101323}{101391}You know a million words|and how they should be used.
{101395}{101510}I'm sending you to fight your war,|to talk up a howling mob.
{101514}{101605}I'll stay here and hit a lick.
{101634}{101678}I hope you can drive a mule.
{101682}{101726}His name's Jesús, they told me.
{101730}{101820}He seems a good, honest mule.
{101970}{102038}Maybe I'll never see you again.
{102042}{102110}If that's what's written,|that's what's written.
{102114}{102158}When it's time, it's time.
{102162}{102230}Talkin' only makes it the harder, Flaca.
{102234}{102278}So stir up that mule.
{102282}{102344}Davy, I...
{102665}{102755}You never pray, do you, Davy?
{102833}{102914}I never found the time.
{103504}{103576}Sir! Tennesseans.
{103672}{103740}Colonel Travis!
{103744}{103822}Crockett and his men.
{103888}{103932}Go down and open the gate.
{103936}{103980}I'll just holler down.
{103984}{104076}Your orders were to go down,|not holler down, Mr Dennison!
{104080}{104141}Yes, sir.
{104511}{104555}Crack shots, those Tennesseans.
{104559}{104651}Twenty times their number's|what we need, and more.
{104655}{104747}Oh, I'm sorry, Will. Such gloomy|remarks are for your ears alone.
{104751}{104861}Isn't that Bowie galloping up to catch 'em?
{104943}{105011}I can just hear him pleading his cause.
{105015}{105083}Crockett seems to me the type of man|that would choose Bowie.
{105087}{105155}What you mean is|he isn't the type of man to choose me.
{105159}{105251}Oh, Will. Depend on you|to say it the most brutal way.
{105255}{105335}Most facts are brutal!
{105423}{105491}Just look at that great knife fighter|yapping at Crockett.
{105495}{105562}Cut, slash, and run!
{105566}{105634}Let's get mounted. Cut, slash, and run!
{105638}{105682}Cut, slash, and run.
{105686}{105778}Cost Santa Anna a hundred troops|at every creek crossing...
{105782}{105826}...between here and the North.
{105830}{105898}Sounds reasonable the way you put it...
{105902}{105970}{y:i}...but Travis has a point, too.|Takes thinkin' on.
{105974}{105994}Hey, Jim!
{105998}{106042}Halt! Who goes there?
{106046}{106162}Bob, I swear I'm gonna shoot you|off that wall. Are you blind?
{106166}{106210}That's what I was told to holler every time.
{106214}{106282}Well, don't holler at me!
{106286}{106306}Idiot.
{106310}{106420}You think on it, Davy. You'll side with me.
{106621}{106665}What is it?
{106669}{106761}Tennesseans, Nell. 23 of 'em.|All the way from home.
{106765}{106857}Do you recognise any, Jocko?|Is my brother Malachi with them?
{106861}{106929}He was a fella to go|where there was trouble.
{106933}{106977}He was that.
{106981}{107025}But, Nell, you know Malachi was hung.
{107029}{107113}Or so some folks told us.
{107125}{107265}Colonel Crockett. I am glad you were able|to persuade your men to join us.
{107269}{107313}Well, they insisted, sort of.
{107317}{107385}Our heartiest welcome!
{107389}{107433}Ladies and gentlemen...
{107437}{107528}{y:i}...we are proud to welcome|these patriotic men...
{107532}{107624}{y:i}...who have travelled 1500 miles|to join us in our hour of need.
{107628}{107672}Sergeant Lightfoot!|- Yes, sir?
{107676}{107768}You will have your men|raise a cheer for our gallant allies...
{107772}{107840}...from the illustrious state of Tennessee!|- Yes, sir!
{107844}{107912}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{107916}{107960}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{107964}{108032}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{108036}{108128}Captain, you will attend to|the billeting of these men.
{108132}{108272}After you are quartered, I will take you|on a tour of the emplacements.
{108276}{108353}This way, gentlemen.
{108396}{108478}Crockett! Davy Crockett!
{108492}{108583}We're from Tennessee.|- Well, howdy, folks!
{108587}{108655}We seen you when you came|to Stink Wells...
{108659}{108703}{y:i}...to speak about that job for the Congress.
{108707}{108775}You shook hands with me.|- I'll do her again.
{108779}{108847}He didn't vote for you, though.
{108851}{108895}Other fella gave him four bits.|- I'm sorry.
{108899}{108991}Don't be. Glad there were|enough sensible folks like you...
{108995}{109039}{y:i}...to vote me out of that job.
{109043}{109135}Well, later on we'll have|a real old home talkfest.
{109139}{109293}Right now we've got to get quartered|and bedded down. Would you excuse us?
{109307}{109408}You should have voted for him, Jocko.
{109522}{109600}¡Soldados! ¡Soldados!
{109978}{110068}{y:i}¡Columna a la izquierda!
{110410}{110525}Of our 24 pieces of ordnance,|five are these six-pounders.
{110529}{110619}Something's stirring in town!
{110817}{110861}Ladies will take cover, please!
{110865}{110956}Men, to your battle positions!
{111489}{111556}¡Los documentos!
{111560}{111604}Los documentos.
{111608}{111729}{y:i}Teniente, cumpla con sus órdenes.|- Sí, señor.
{112280}{112348}Captain Dickinson,|are your men disposed?
{112352}{112429}At their posts, sir!
{112519}{112587}No one will fire unless I so order!
{112591}{112721}Those people are under|the protection of a flag of truce.
{112855}{112923}¡Columna alto!
{113023}{113139}From Generalissimo Antonio López de|Santa Anna, absolute ruler of Mexico...
{113143}{113211}{y:i}...to the rebel commander|who deems himself in command...
{113215}{113283}{y:i}...of the rebels occupying the mission.
{113287}{113331}Be it known:
{113335}{113403}The province of Mexico known as Texas...
{113407}{113498}{y:i}...has shown itself to be|in active and treasonous revolt...
{113502}{113570}...against the rule of|Generalissimo Santa Anna.
{113574}{113618}The generalissimo issues|the following order.
{113622}{113714}All occupants of the mission|will leave at once...
{113718}{113786}...leaving all arms|and ammunition behind them.
{113790}{113858}If this order is not followed with dispatch...
{113862}{113930}{y:i}...the generalissimo will reduce|the mission by assault.
{113934}{114027}There will be no quarter given.
{114222}{114266}{y:i}¡Columna a la derecha!
{114270}{114331}¡Marchen!
{114821}{114911}Well, what do you think, Jim?
{114941}{115081}I hate to say anything good about|that long-winded jackanapes...
{115085}{115211}{y:i}...but he does know|the short way to start a war.
{115756}{115821}The Sixth...
{115828}{115923}The Sixth Vera Cruzano Fusiliers.
{115996}{116088}They're bivouacking about|a mile south of our west bastion.
{116092}{116160}Light artillery, lancers, some engineers.
{116164}{116280}Not one unit of heavy assault troops yet,|and it still adds up to 2,000 men.
{116284}{116352}That'll be to our advantage, Dick.
{116356}{116448}That main body must be|strung out for miles.
{116452}{116543}The assault infantry,|heavy artillery and supply trains...
{116547}{116591}They won't be here for four or five days.
{116595}{116663}The actual battle can't start until then.
{116667}{116759}Oh, there'll be an occasional sortie|feeling out our defences.
{116763}{116879}But they won't commit to an attack until|Santa Anna is here with his main force.
{116883}{116986}Then what?|- Then Fannin will be here.
{117123}{117191}More troops arriving every hour.
{117195}{117263}Prettiest army I ever did see.
{117267}{117311}Yeah.
{117315}{117383}If I take my men out, do you go with me?
{117387}{117479}Davy, you know this old mission|can't stand up to Santa Anna's army.
{117483}{117550}My way's the only way.|- Travis says that Fannin's coming.
{117554}{117713}Travis says! I wouldn't take Travis's|word that night's dark and day's light.
{117770}{117790}Blowin' on a horn. That's all.
{117794}{117862}Chicken in the bread bag,|pickin' up the corn. That's all.
{117866}{117934}Flies in the buttermilk.|Shoo, fly, shoo! That's all.
{117938}{118006}Ants in the sugar bowl.|Two by two. That's all.
{118010}{118126}I carried twice as much!|- You're twice as big.
{118130}{118207}Patrol's in trouble!
{118657}{118701}Doggone it, Beekeeper!
{118705}{118797}I thought you wasn't gonna open|that corn liquor till nightfall!
{118801}{118893}It's only a half-hour till dark.
{118897}{118965}Besides, it's my keg, ain't it?
{118969}{119013}Well, all right. Give me some of that stuff!
{119017}{119085}I'm so scared I could drink all of it!
{119089}{119133}Maybe I will.
{119137}{119205}What'd you see, Irish?
{119209}{119277}More than I wanted to, Jim.|A lot of men arriving.
{119281}{119373}And they got the durned|blastedest cannon ever I did see!
{119377}{119454}Something like this.
{119568}{119636}12 or 14 foot long maybe!
{119640}{119708}He sure draws pretty, don't he?|- Frightening!
{119712}{119780}12 or 14 feet long. Are you sure, Irish?
{119784}{119828}Well, yeah...|- Finn!
{119832}{119876}Yes, sir!
{119880}{119972}You were ordered to report to me,|not to hold lecture courses. Get up here!
{119976}{120081}All right, Will... uh... Colonel Travis.
{120144}{120188}Hey, Travis! With a cannon like that...
{120192}{120308}{y:i}...them Santa Anna fellas can just sit up|there and give us what for, can't they?
{120312}{120380}There's no such cannon|in the North American continent.
{120384}{120452}They have some in Europe,|according to last reports.
{120456}{120547}Acting Lieutenant Finn is exaggerating.
{120551}{120609}¡Fuego!
{120743}{120873}She's a big one, Davy!|And she's shooting from over here!
{121055}{121123}Battery One! Is your gun ready?
{121127}{121171}We're primed and ready, sir!
{121175}{121219}Give it full elevation!
{121223}{121284}Yes, sir!
{121367}{121411}The gun is ready, sir!
{121415}{121470}Fire!
{121654}{121757}Kinda short there, Colonel, Mr Travis!
{121870}{121986}I'm sure I'm glad I seen that there cannon|sitting out there on that prairie.
{121990}{122058}For a minute I thought|they was shooting at us...
{122062}{122106}{y:i}...from one of them countries|over in Europe.
{122110}{122154}Oh, my goodness!
{122158}{122210}No!
{122230}{122298}Oh, no! They wouldn't dare!
{122302}{122412}Man, that ain't no fair way to fight a war!
{122517}{122609}Well, I guess we'd better do|somethin' about that, Crockett.
{122613}{122681}Plain as can be.|- About an hour after dark?
{122685}{122729}Good.
{122733}{122777}Thimblerig, 15 men.
{122781}{122825}Right after dark.
{122829}{122891}All sober.
{123141}{123161}Boo!
{123165}{123233}Halt!|- I lost the bet.
{123237}{123305}I bet my friends I could sneak up|on you without you hearing me.
{123309}{123420}Friend, you like to got a hole in your head.
{123429}{123481}Ha!
{123500}{123634}Tie him loose.|- Kick that fire out and kill our silhouette.
{123644}{123738}Let's go. Company One, let's go!
{124052}{124096}Everything set?|- Yes, sir.
{124100}{124144}All right. It's time, men.
{124148}{124240}Open the gate!|- Colonel Travis, sentry here!
{124244}{124312}Somebody jumped me!|- I'll say they did!
{124316}{124432}Shoved me down, tied me up, and|some of them stepped on me goin' by.
{124436}{124551}And never so much as|a by-your-leave from every one of them.
{124555}{124613}Dammit!
{124675}{124743}Return to your posts.|- Yes, sir.
{124747}{124817}Close the gate!
{124867}{124935}Well, you'd better get|your men mounted, then.
{124939}{125007}See if you can give them any help.|- Yes, sir.
{125011}{125092}Detail! Stand to horse!
{125634}{125704}Get the powder!
{125874}{125984}Where's the mud?|- It's comin'. Here it is.
{127025}{127093}¿Qúe es?|- ¡Es un cañon!
{127097}{127165}Clear out! I'll cover!
{127169}{127243}You heard the man.
{127361}{127472}Come on, kid! Get outta here!|- I can shoot.
{127504}{127611}Golly! What a gun!|- Go on! Grab a horse!
{127792}{127859}Cannon party!
{127864}{127932}No one will fire until|you can identify your target!
{127936}{127997}Yes, sir!
{128104}{128211}Let's give 'em a hand, boys! Knock on it!
{128559}{128627}Pick 'em up! Pick 'em up!
{128631}{128744}Everybody rides double!|Come on! Pick 'em up!
{129255}{129385}Hold the gate! Hold the gate!|- Somebody's still outside!
{129542}{129610}Close the gate!
{129614}{129658}Good work, Smitty!
{129662}{129730}We never missed you.|Good thing the kid did.
{129734}{129778}That horse folded with me.
{129782}{129826}You all right, Jim?|- Sure.
{129830}{129898}Oh, Mr Smith! You've been hurt!|- Oh, it's all right.
{129902}{129970}Let's take a look at that.|- Doctor!
{129974}{130018}Mm. No bones broken.
{130022}{130090}All you need is a little|Doctor Beekeeper's fix-all.
{130094}{130155}See? I...
{130190}{130234}Pretty close.
{130238}{130354}Bowie?|- Oh, he's all right. Turned a horse over.
{130358}{130402}Jethro?|- Yes, sir.
{130406}{130497}Tell Colonel Bowie|I wish to speak to him at once.
{130501}{130545}Yes, sir.
{130549}{130617}Over here, where we can|have a little privacy.
{130621}{130682}Yes, sir.
{131077}{131164}Post this area.|- Yes, sir!
{131245}{131337}Will, considering the way|things turned out, I...
{131341}{131422}Dick, leave this to me.
{131940}{132008}Colonel Bowie.
{132012}{132125}I have had just about|enough insubordination.
{132132}{132176}You have?
{132180}{132248}All right. Let's get to it. When and where?
{132252}{132320}I hear you're a good shot,|so let's choose pistols.
{132324}{132392}I assumed you would choose|the ruffian's knife.
{132396}{132440}Gentlemen, I beg...|- Dick, act for me!
{132444}{132488}Time?
{132492}{132587}I suggest after this war is over.
{132611}{132655}Yes.
{132659}{132727}The minute...|the very minute this war is over.
{132731}{132799}Jim?|- That's fine with me.
{132803}{132871}One last word, Bowie.
{132875}{132919}This evening's episode...
{132923}{133015}By going on a mission without orders|you endangered this command.
{133019}{133087}If it had not been for|the intervention of Captain Dickinson...
{133091}{133183}{y:i}...a large number of volunteers|would now be dead out there...
{133187}{133231}...instead of at their posts in here.
{133235}{133327}I demand your word of honour that|there will no repetition of such conduct.
{133331}{133447}Or else I shall be forced|to order your arrest.
{133522}{133583}Travis...
{133594}{133724}Don't you worry any more|about arrest or insubordination.
{133738}{133833}I take my people out at daybreak.
{133978}{134046}Colonel Travis...
{134050}{134094}I'm an old man...
{134098}{134182}{y:i}...but you're wrong.
{134266}{134334}That Jethro...
{134338}{134382}Reminds me of a story...
{134386}{134430}Please, Crockett!
{134434}{134501}No homespun wisdom.|No cracker-barrel philosophy.
{134505}{134644}None of the backwoods wit|for which you are famous. Good night!
{134649}{134717}You'd better slack off on me, mister.
{134721}{134813}This code of honour business|doesn't bother me a bit.
{134817}{134885}When there's trouble|I come from any direction...
{134889}{134933}{y:i}...as sudden and surprising as I can.
{134937}{135029}My only concern here is 23 Tennesseans.
{135033}{135149}So you'd better let me know|what's in your mind.
{135153}{135277}I'd have thought that would|have been obvious to you.
{135321}{135389}It's as simple as this.
{135393}{135461}There's Santa Anna with 7,000 men.
{135465}{135532}Up here is the Sabine River.
{135536}{135580}Somewhere around here...
{135584}{135652}{y:i}...Sam Houston is trying|to organise an army.
{135656}{135748}And right in between... is the Alamo.
{135752}{135868}Santa Anna can't go around and leave|a fort along his lines of communication.
{135872}{135916}He must reduce the Alamo by storm.
{135920}{136012}Every minute of time|we buy for Sam Houston...
{136016}{136084}{y:i}...is another precious minute|in the life of Texas.
{136088}{136180}And nobody is ever going to say|that William Barrett Travis...
{136184}{136276}{y:i}...did not buy every minute possible.
{136280}{136348}Makes sense.|Why didn't you tell Bowie that?
{136352}{136420}A commander does not have|to explain his every decision.
{136424}{136492}You explained to me.
{136496}{136539}I have great respect for you, Crockett.
{136543}{136659}But I have none for that|knife-fighting adventurer.
{136663}{136755}I figured any fella that shouldered|a gun was deserving of respect.
{136759}{136851}But then I'm not... a real soldier.
{136855}{136923}I never fought anybody but Injuns.
{136927}{136995}Less'n you count the British.
{136999}{137060}Crockett.
{137119}{137211}I must ask you to forgive|my rudeness earlier on to you.
{137215}{137310}I'm an easy forgiver... at times.
{137335}{137410}Good night, Travis.
{137838}{137930}Crack out a couple of jugs|and bring that guitar.
{137934}{137978}What are we gonna do, Davy?
{137982}{138043}Serenade.
{138342}{138362}Well...
{138366}{138458}I hope you told that long-winded idiot|what you think of him.
{138462}{138596}I'm not rightly sure what I think of him.|- What's all this?
{138605}{138721}Well, I figured we'd crack a jug|and tell each other our troubles.
{138725}{138769}Now wait a minute, Crockett.
{138773}{138841}Don't try your winnin' ways on me.|My mind's made up.
{138845}{138913}Well, we can have a farewell drink.
{138917}{138961}You mean you're stayin'?
{138965}{139033}That's what I figure, Jim.
{139037}{139105}All right. We'll have a drink or two or ten.
{139109}{139177}But you ain't gonna get me drunk|and change my mind.
{139181}{139249}Of course not!
{139421}{139465}Water patrol! Let's go!
{139469}{139536}Rise and shine! Up and at 'em!
{139540}{139584}Beekeeper, come on! Show a leg!
{139588}{139632}Get out of there!
{139636}{139704}Thimblerig, come on! It's your duty.
{139708}{139776}It's your duty!|- You don't have to wake us all!
{139780}{139903}I'll get 'em up, Sergeant.|- Thanks, Parson. Thanks.
{139924}{139968}Hey!
{139972}{140064}Two dollars American|if you take out my patrol.
{140068}{140160}Two dollars? This morning|I wouldn't take your patrol for ten.
{140164}{140268}I would!|- Got yourself a deal, Scotty.
{140356}{140467}Well, Davy, it looks like you done it again.
{140500}{140557}It do.
{140571}{140672}And Bowie?|- Looked like a tie to me.
{140787}{140849}Your duty!
{141554}{141622}Good morning, Colonel.|He's still sleepin'.
{141626}{141719}I'll take care of that, Jethro.
{141770}{141814}Aaagh!
{141818}{141872}Hey!
{141938}{141982}Ow!
{141986}{142047}Crockett!
{142058}{142119}Crockett!
{142202}{142294}Crockett, what the devil...|- Good morning, Smitty. Doc.
{142298}{142342}Davy.|- Good morning.
{142346}{142401}Well!
{142418}{142486}You got yourself famous.|Now when they talk about Jim Bowie...
{142490}{142581}...they'll tell about the man that|pulled him out from under the troops.
{142585}{142629}Gee! Will they?
{142633}{142725}Jim, the kid wants to know|about that sand bar episode.
{142729}{142773}Oh, come on, Crockett!|- That's the truth.
{142777}{142869}He's never heard anything but hearsay.|- Gosh, yes, Mr Bowie!
{142873}{142989}All the fellas back home talk about...|- By the way, Smitty...
{142993}{143068}Say goodbye to Jim.
{143089}{143194}Are you going someplace, Colonel... Jim?
{143209}{143261}No.
{143281}{143373}No, I'm not goin' noplace.|That's just Crockett's idea of a joke.
{143377}{143421}Now you get well, Smitty, boy.
{143425}{143509}And thanks for your help.
{143784}{143876}What are you doin'?|- It was rumoured we were leavin'.
{143880}{144010}I'll tell you when we're leaving.|Get that gear put away.
{144024}{144085}Crockett.
{144695}{144763}By God, boy! You're bad-tempered!
{144767}{144835}Don't you ever try to make|a fool out of me again!
{144839}{144883}Once is enough.|- I make up my own mind.
{144887}{144955}Never thought otherwise, Jim.
{144959}{145075}I was wondering... You think there'd be|a mouthful of that corn juice left?
{145079}{145147}We could kinda|cut the tar out of our throats.
{145151}{145219}That's a great idea, Davy!
{145223}{145300}That's a great idea!
{145343}{145437}I still say you're bad-tempered.
{145558}{145616}¡Amigo!
{145630}{145698}Halt! Who goes there?
{145702}{145770}Don't shoot, amigo!
{145774}{145856}A message for Jim Bowie.
{145870}{145941}In the sombrero!
{146110}{146130}Jim!
{146134}{146252}Fella says there's a message|in this hat for you.
{146302}{146394}Huh! Kind of a strange way|to be sending messages, ain't it?
{146398}{146453}Yeah.
{146470}{146560}Maybe Santa Anna surrendered.
{147644}{147715}What is it, Jim?
{147764}{147832}I never... knew the night...
{147836}{147913}...could be so dark.
{147980}{148051}My... my wife...
{148100}{148157}She...
{148172}{148240}She's... dead.
{148436}{148518}I lived through it, Jim.
{148555}{148617}It's hard.
{148627}{148695}It was the plague.
{148699}{148770}The damn plague!
{148819}{148893}Oh, God, dear God!
{149107}{149151}Oh, Davy... she...
{149155}{149223}She was so small.
{149227}{149307}So tiny. So very tiny.
{149347}{149439}She wanted to stay in Bexar|to be near me, but...
{149443}{149534}{y:i}...I made her go to Coahuila.
{149538}{149606}I made her go!
{149658}{149729}My man Parson...
{149754}{149822}He's a kind of a preacher.
{149826}{149900}He keeps sayin'...
{149922}{150012}...little do we mortals know.
{150162}{150243}Hold your head up, Jim.
{150306}{150350}Colonel Bowie...
{150354}{150422}You've had a communication|from outside these walls.
{150426}{150470}This is against my orders.
{150474}{150572}What information have you received?
{150593}{150680}Bowie, hand me that letter!
{150761}{150838}You may die tonight.
{150857}{150925}That little lady, Jim.
{150929}{151003}She won't like it.
{151888}{151932}Colonel Bowie...
{151936}{152044}Please accept|my most profound sympathy...
{152056}{152172}{y:i}...and my regret for having|disturbed you at such a moment.
{152176}{152345}This in no way impairs your right to call|me on the field of honour at a later date.
{152511}{152603}But I wish to express my sorrow for you...
{152607}{152753}{y:i}...and present my apology for|being such a boor at such a time.
{152775}{152819}Travis...
{152823}{152910}You can't help bein' you...
{152943}{153040}{y:i}...and I can't help bein' me.
{153638}{153754}What's that all about, Sergeant?|- 32 cases hospitalised today, sir.
{153758}{153850}Well... Tell 'em to move over|after last night's party...
{153854}{153946}Oh, no, sir. Women and children.
{153950}{154031}Another officers' call.
{154046}{154090}See for yourself. It's all like that.
{154094}{154148}Sir.
{154166}{154228}Gentlemen.
{154238}{154306}Doctor.|- It's as simple as this, gentlemen.
{154310}{154378}I had 32 cases|of mild dysentery this morning.
{154382}{154474}I tested the salt pork barrel the rations|were issued from. It's tainted.
{154478}{154545}So is every other barrel in the warehouse.
{154549}{154569}Sergeant.
{154573}{154617}Barring the pork, I figure we have...
{154621}{154757}...three or four days' full rations|to serve to the garrison.
{154789}{154833}You see the dilemma, gentlemen.
{154837}{154881}We are almost out of food.
{154885}{155001}However, Santa Anna does not|suffer under the same handicap.
{155005}{155049}Therefore our course is obvious.
{155053}{155130}If you'll follow me.
{155149}{155247}{y:i}? Vuelve, el gitano, vuelve...
{155485}{155540}¡Olé!
{156132}{156224}I can think of more comfortable places|to watch that show from.
{156228}{156285}Quiet!
{156827}{156871}Dick.
{156875}{156936}Yes, sir?
{156971}{157039}It's a half-hour to daybreak.
{157043}{157087}Have your men stand to horse.
{157091}{157152}Yes, sir.
{159728}{159772}The night herders.
{159776}{159844}Two to each one of 'em.
{159848}{159916}Don't miss.|There'll be a lot of hungry kids.
{159920}{159964}Take 'em.
{159968}{160026}Smitty.
{160064}{160132}Grab a horse off that picket line for Smitty.
{160136}{160180}Get a good one.
{160184}{160228}Colonel Davy?
{160232}{160300}Can I ask you fellas|something face to face?
{160304}{160348}Sure thing, kid.
{160352}{160468}Are you really sending me because|I'm a good horseman like you said?
{160472}{160515}As I live and breathe!
{160519}{160587}You're smarter than Beekeeper|and you swim better than the gambler.
{160591}{160683}It ain't that you don't think I'd be|worth my salt when the fighting starts?
{160687}{160731}Smitty, let me tell you something.
{160735}{160851}Of all the men in this outfit, I'd pick you|to side me if the goin' was rough.
{160855}{160923}You see?|- Gee!
{160927}{161001}Get on this horse.
{161071}{161139}There's nothing out there,|kid, but dark.
{161143}{161217}Good luck, Smitty.
{161311}{161379}It'll take him quite a few days|to get to Houston.
{161383}{161463}That's what I figured.
{161790}{161834}The south side's all taken care of.
{161838}{161903}Get a horse.
{161934}{162019}Now all we can do is wait.
{162030}{162074}That's the hardest part.
{162078}{162142}It sure is.
{162198}{162263}Column halt!
{162294}{162338}Carry on, Dick.
{162342}{162386}Good luck.|- Thank you, Will.
{162390}{162458}Best of luck, Dickinson.
{162462}{162532}Forward, yo-ho!
{162989}{163119}If they don't shoot pretty quick,|we've got to go anyway.
{163397}{163467}Let's take 'em!
{165411}{165481}Hold your fire!
{165506}{165526}Hold your fire!
{165530}{165574}Pick your targets!
{165578}{165622}Fire!
{165626}{165693}Fire at will!
{165890}{165958}Second rank, fire!
{165962}{166040}Fall back! Fall back!
{166130}{166192}Fall back!
{166729}{166749}Fire!
{166753}{166797}Fall back!
{166801}{166845}Second rank!
{166849}{166893}Fire!
{166897}{166959}Fall back!
{167017}{167061}Third rank!
{167065}{167085}Ready?
{167089}{167144}Fire!
{167353}{167417}Cease fire!
{167640}{167684}Close the gate!
{167688}{167756}There's one thing for sure.
{167760}{167804}He's a bearcat for nerve.
{167808}{167852}I'm grateful for that.
{167856}{167948}I'd hate to look at a coward|over a duellin' pistol.
{167952}{168068}You're not much for this forgive|and forget business, are you, Jim?
{168072}{168124}No.
{168575}{168619}Beef for supper.
{168623}{168684}Yes, sir.
{168791}{168859}Hog never rightly could pass for meat.
{168863}{168924}But beef!
{169127}{169195}The big he-bull himself!
{169199}{169243}Let's go!
{169247}{169291}Ladies to cover!
{169295}{169369}Men to your posts!
{170110}{170154}Captain Dickinson.|- Yes, sir.
{170158}{170250}Order all men fed in relays.|Full issue of ammunition.
{170254}{170315}Yes, sir.
{170470}{170537}That's the best-dressed army I ever saw.
{170541}{170609}Fancy clothes don't make a fightin' man.
{170613}{170681}They're just off two years|puttin' down revolts.
{170685}{170763}They're fightin' men.
{171668}{171760}Generalissimo Santa Anna has just|arrived with the main body of his army...
{171764}{171808}{y:i}...and has only now become aware...
{171812}{171880}{y:i}...that there are women|and children in the mission.
{171884}{171952}He wishes that the ladies|receive his apologies...
{171956}{172024}{y:i}...and be informed he has|never attacked a position...
{172028}{172096}...without the enemy|being given the opportunity...
{172100}{172168}{y:i}...to evacuate women and children.
{172172}{172264}According, you have one hour in which|to evacuate these noncombatants...
{172268}{172336}{y:i}...who will be provided with transport...
{172340}{172408}{y:i}...to proceed to such destination|as is their choice.
{172412}{172503}Signed: Antonio López|de Santa Anna, ruler of Mexico.
{172507}{172572}Your answer?
{172675}{172743}My compliments to the general|for his gallantry.
{172747}{172845}We will evacuate our noncombatants.
{173131}{173199}Single men will remain at their posts!
{173203}{173329}Married men will arrange|transport for their families!
{174066}{174158}Sue, you'd better hurry.|- She won't go.
{174162}{174254}Save your breath, Will.|Your ever so persuasive breath.
{174258}{174302}All right, say it.
{174306}{174374}It's a sorry man|that can't make his wife obey.
{174378}{174446}You seem to forget, Dick,|that I too am married.
{174450}{174517}I've got to do what I think is the right thing.
{174521}{174613}I'm a soldier's wife.|My child is a soldier's child.
{174617}{174661}We'll stay.
{174665}{174709}Very well, Sue.
{174713}{174757}Dick.
{174761}{174829}Don't be angry with me.
{174833}{174877}I'm not angry.
{174881}{174943}I'm proud.
{175001}{175099}Dick, take your patrol.|- Yes, sir.
{175169}{175237}Married men, return to your posts!
{175241}{175285}Open the gate!
{175289}{175333}Captain Dickinson!
{175337}{175381}Escort! Forward!
{175385}{175442}Yo-ho!
{175624}{175740}Ma'am, I ain't got no woman to say|goodbye to. Could I tell you goodbye?
{175744}{175802}Surely.
{175816}{175887}Get up, boy! Ya!
{175984}{176028}Jocko, Nell.
{176032}{176094}It's time.
{176559}{176656}Go on, Jocko. Do the best you can.
{176967}{177026}I can't.
{177135}{177194}I can't.
{177303}{177347}I just can't do it, fellas.
{177351}{177419}Colonel Bowie.
{177423}{177467}This is a request and not an order.
{177471}{177538}But I suggest that,|as desperate as our needs are...
{177542}{177658}{y:i}...that family's needs are more desperate.
{177662}{177778}Get in that line, Jocko,|and move out with your people.
{177782}{177826}You can see how it is.
{177830}{177874}It's more than a man can bear.
{177878}{178018}She's never said a word of pity for herself|in the ten years she's been blind.
{178022}{178066}Will Travis!|Just who do you think you are?
{178070}{178234}Mrs Robertson, I can assure you that no|blame will attach itself to your husband.
{178238}{178330}Get movin', Jocko, or I'll help you|along with the toe of my boot.
{178334}{178402}Shut up, Jim Bowie!|And you and Travis listen close.
{178406}{178521}My man ain't goin' out. He's just as much|a man as either one of you. Maybe more.
{178525}{178641}In spite of he ain't rich like you, Jim,|or fancy educated like you, Will Travis.
{178645}{178689}Now, Jocko, you get back up on that wall.
{178693}{178785}Cos you're just as good as|any man that ever trod leather.
{178789}{178833}And it's your right.
{178837}{178953}And I can't see, but I'm just as good|as any woman in Texas.
{178957}{179025}And it's my right to go and leave you.
{179029}{179145}Now we've cuddled nice and said|all our goodbyes, but I'll say it again.
{179149}{179193}We'd be fools not to face it.
{179197}{179265}You're likely to go and get|yourself killed in this battle.
{179269}{179361}I don't know what you're going|to say at the gates of heaven...
{179365}{179481}{y:i}...but I'm gonna say no woman ever lived|had herself a better husband than you.
{179485}{179547}Now go on!
{179844}{179912}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{179916}{179960}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{179964}{180039}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{181091}{181159}Captain Dickinson!
{181163}{181207}Yes, sir.
{181211}{181255}Have the Doctor set up|the hospital in the chapel.
{181259}{181379}You will take charge of Battery No. 4.|- Yes, sir.
{182338}{182435}{y:i}¡Clarines! ¡Suenen al ataque!
{182482}{182544}¡Adelante!
{183033}{183101}Hold your fire.
{183105}{183175}Hold your fire.
{183273}{183334}Take 'em!
{183920}{183964}Straight frontal attack!
{183968}{184108}We need more men up here!|I'll get some strength from Dickinson.
{184519}{184601}North wall! Hurry it up!
{184687}{184777}Who is it?|- It's the Parson.
{185502}{185599}{y:i}¡Clarines! ¡Suenen al retiro!
{185886}{185930}Hold your fire!
{185934}{186029}Hold your fire! They're retiring!
{186486}{186529}See did any of our boys get hurt.
{186533}{186673}I'll be below gettin' washed on|the outside and wet down inside.
{186677}{186758}We've been lucky today.
{186821}{186865}Check the damage.
{186869}{186960}Officers' call in ten minutes.
{186965}{187037}Bring on another.
{187972}{188064}Sure killed many a brave man today.
{188068}{188160}It's funny. I was proud of 'em.
{188164}{188280}Even while I was killin' 'em|I was proud of 'em.
{188284}{188352}Speaks well for men|that so many ain't afraid to die...
{188356}{188448}...because they think right's on their side.
{188452}{188517}Speaks well.
{188691}{188759}Post this area, Lightfoot.|- It's already done.
{188763}{188807}All right, Sergeant.
{188811}{188855}Report!|- 50 casualties.
{188859}{188927}28 dead, 22 wounded.
{188931}{188999}Morale... high.
{189003}{189095}Morale ain't gonna help us much|if Fannin don't get here... and quick!
{189099}{189143}Ow, Doc!|- Quit squawking.
{189147}{189215}You oughta be laying on your back.|You'll never walk.
{189219}{189311}Santa Anna didn't have much respect|for us today, and he got burned.
{189315}{189407}Now he's gonna be comin' at us|with a battle plan from all four sides.
{189411}{189526}We already been cut down by a third.|How long do you think we can hold out?
{189530}{189574}Santa Anna won't attack again today.
{189578}{189646}He'll clear the field of|all the dead and wounded.
{189650}{189718}Fannin will be here by tomorrow,|even without a forced march.
{189722}{189790}With his 500 men...
{189794}{189838}{y:i}...we can hold this fort for a month.
{189842}{189910}500? I thought it was a thousand.
{189914}{190006}500.|- Bonham's approaching, sir.
{190010}{190110}Good. Fannin should be close behind.
{190394}{190414}Well?
{190418}{190486}Colonel Fannin isn't comin'.
{190490}{190557}His men were ambushed. Murdered!
{190561}{190643}There won't be any help.
{190705}{190819}Have all volunteers|assembled in the compound.
{190921}{190965}Well, that's it.
{190969}{191037}I'm taking my men out.|Cut through to the North.
{191041}{191105}You comin'?
{191185}{191290}It seems like the better part of valour.
{191976}{192033}Men...
{192048}{192092}Jim Bonham has brought|news as sad as death.
{192096}{192188}Colonel Fannin has been ambushed.
{192192}{192272}We can expect no help.
{192288}{192376}I stay here with my command.
{192384}{192499}But any of you who wish to|may leave with all honour.
{192503}{192617}Failing reinforcements,|the Alamo cannot hold.
{192623}{192715}But do not go with heads hung low.
{192719}{192811}No man can criticise your behaviour.
{192815}{192899}Here on these ramparts...
{192911}{193027}{y:i}...you have bought a priceless|ten days of time for Houston.
{193031}{193099}You have bled the enemy army.
{193103}{193195}You are brave and noble soldiers.
{193199}{193267}Open the gate!
{193319}{193393}May God bless you.
{196220}{196290}Close the gate!
{196699}{196743}Hold up there, bub.
{196747}{196815}You're in dangerous territory.|Where you headin'?
{196819}{196911}I'm lookin' for General Sam Houston.|Got a message for him.
{196915}{196959}Well, you've come to the right place.
{196963}{197055}Corporal of the guard! Post No. 3!
{197059}{197127}What is it?|- He wants to see General Sam.
{197131}{197198}Come on, bub!
{197850}{197942}The lad has a message for the general.|- Yes, sir.
{197946}{198062}You'd better get down, and get yourself|some beans and a little sleep.
{198066}{198086}No, sir!
{198090}{198185}I've gotta get back to the Alamo.
{199001}{199069}Yesterday I read you Fannin's message...
{199073}{199189}...telling us he cannot reach|the Alamo in time.
{199193}{199293}Today I have this... from the Alamo.
{199337}{199381}They are surrounded...
{199385}{199477}{y:i}...and we can't help them.
{199481}{199524}Now, tomorrow...
{199528}{199659}{y:i}...when your recruits|start to whine and bellyache...
{199696}{199816}{y:i}...you tell them that 185 of their friends...
{199888}{199983}...neighbours, fellow Texicans...
{200008}{200124}{y:i}...are holed up in a crumbling adobe|church down on the Rio Bravo...
{200128}{200225}...buying them this precious time.
{200392}{200470}I hope they remember.
{200511}{200592}I hope Texas remembers.

{201902}{201946}I'm sorry.
{201950}{202011}What for?
{202022}{202090}I guess I've said some|pretty rude things to you.
{202094}{202185}Well, at least, I thought 'em.
{202190}{202234}You're a wonderful woman, Sue.
{202238}{202282}Forget it.
{202286}{202378}Dick, stay here as long as you can.
{202382}{202483}Probably won't need you till morning.
{202501}{202593}I've only added to your worries, haven't I?
{202597}{202688}I know I must be very selfish.
{202717}{202785}I couldn't think of facing|the world without you.

{203964}{204042}I'm just rememberin'.
{204132}{204224}Well, I sure done a heap of things|I shouldn't have done.
{204228}{204316}Seemed urgent at the moment.
{204324}{204416}Got myself a heap of sins to answer for.
{204420}{204488}Wish I hadn't did 'em.
{204492}{204607}I reckon old Saint Pete's gonna slam them|Pearly Gates right smack-dab in my face.

{204659}{204751}When you're dead, you're meat for|the worms. That's all there is to it.
{204755}{204823}You don't believe in no afterlife?|No hereafter?
{204827}{204919}Tales for children! Bunkum and bosh!
{204923}{204987}I say this.
{204995}{205039}I believe.
{205043}{205177}I can never find a way to argue down|you that don't believe.
{205187}{205255}But I believe in the Lord God Almighty...
{205259}{205351}{y:i}...all knowing and all forgiving.
{205355}{205471}And I believe that good|shall be triumphant in the end...
{205475}{205542}{y:i}...and that evil shall be vanquished.
{205546}{205614}I believe in a hereafter.
{205618}{205710}Me, too. I figure a man's|got to believe in those things...
{205714}{205806}{y:i}...does he want to believe in|the good things about man.
{205810}{205878}About his very own self.|The real good things.
{205882}{205969}Like courage and honesty...
{206002}{206063}And love.
{206122}{206180}Jethro!
{206218}{206279}Yes, sir.
{206482}{206586}This is somethin' I promised Mrs Bowie.
{206625}{206669}Know what it is?|- No, sir.
{206673}{206741}That's your freedom.
{206745}{206827}You're a free man, Jeth.
{206865}{206909}Thank you, sir.
{206913}{207029}You'd better get your belongings together|and get on over the wall tonight.

{207273}{207317}Good luck, Jeth.
{207321}{207389}Thank you, sir.
{207393}{207461}Uh... Colonel Bowie,|you say I'm a free man?
{207465}{207508}That's right.
{207512}{207580}Well, if I'm free...
{207584}{207676}{y:i}...then I got a right|to decide what I'm gonna do.
{207680}{207796}Seems to me that's what|you men are fighting for.
{207800}{207880}So I... reckon I'll...

Thank heaven the fog is gone.
I...
I do feel... out of sorts this morning.
I wasn't able to get much sleep with that awful foghorn going all night long.
Yes, like having a sick whale in the backyard.
Kept me awake too.
Did it? You have a strange way of showing your restlessness.
You were snoring so hard, I couldn't tell which was the foghorn.
Ten foghorns couldn't disturb you. You haven't a nerve in you. You never had.
Nonsense. You always exaggerate about my snoring.
I couldn't. If you could only hear yourself once.
What's the Joke, I wonder.
It's on me I'll bet that much.
It's always on the old man.
Yes. It's terrible the way we all pick on you, isn't it?
You're so abused!
Never mind.
No matter what the joke is, it's a relief to hear Edmund laugh.
He's been so down in the mouth lately.
Some joke of Jamie's, I'll wager.
He's forever making sneering fun of somebody, that one.
Now, don't start in on poor Jamie, dear.
He'll turn out alright in the end.
You wait and see.
He better start soon then, he's nearly 34.
Good heavens!
Are they gonna stay in the dinning room all day? Jamie! Edmund!
Come out on the porch, give Cathleen a chance to clear the table.
You'd make excuses for him no matter what he did.
I've been teasing your father about his snoring.
I'll... I'll leave it to the boys
James, they must've heard you.
Though not you, Jamie. I could hear you down the hall almost as bad as your father you're like him.
As soon as your head touches the pillow you're off.
And ten foghorns couldn't wake you.
Why are you staring, Jamie? Is my hair coming down? Or... something?
It's hard for me to do it out properly now. My eyes are getting so bad and I can never find my glasses
No. Your hair's alright, Mama.
I was just thinking how well you look.
Just as I was telling her, Jamie.
She's so fat and sassy there will soon be no holding her.
Yes, you certainly look grand, Mama.
And I'll back you up about Papa's snoring.
Gosh! What a racket.
I heard him too "The Moor,
I know his trumpet."
If it takes my snoring to make you remember Shakespeare instead of the dope sheet on the ponies,
I hope I'll keep on with it.
James! You mustn't be so touchy.
Yes, for Pete's sake, Papa!
The first thing after breakfast! Give it a rest, can't you'?
Your father wasn't finding fault with you.
You don't have to always take Jamie's part.
Let's forget it.
You'd think you were the one ten years older.
That's right. Forget everything and face nothing.
It's a convenient philosophy in life if you've no other ambitions than...
James! Be quiet.
What were you two grinning about like Cheshire cats when you came out?
What was the joke?
Yes, let us in on it, lad.
You remember, Papa, the ice pond on
Harker's estate is right next to the farm, and you remember
Shaughnessy keeps pigs.
Well, it seems there's a break in the fence and the pigs have been bathing in the millionaire's ice pond,
Good heavens!
The poor pigs, Shaughnessy yelled, had caught their death of cold.
Many of them were dying of pneumonia, and several others had been taken down with cholera from drinking the poisoned water.
He told Harker he was hiring a lawyer to sue him for damages.
And then he wound up by saying that he had to put up with potato bugs and ticks and poison ivy and snakes and skunks on his farm but he was an honest man who had to draw the line somewhere, and he'd be damned if he'd stand for a
Standard Oil thief trespassing.
So would Harker kindly remove his dirty feet from the premises before he sicked the dog on him.
And Harker did!
Heavens! What a terrible tongue that man has.
The damned old scoundrel.
By God you can't beat him.
The dirty blaggard he'll get me into serious trouble yet.
I hope you told him
I'd be mad as hell
I told him you'd be tickled to death over the great Irish victory and so you are. Stop faking, Papa.
- Well, I'm not tickled to death.
You are too, James.
You're simply denying it.
Well, what are you laughing at?
There's nothing funny! A fine son you are to help that blaggard get me into a lawsuit.
Now, James! Don't lose your temper.
Yes, I suppose your regretting you weren't there to prompt Shaughnessy with a few nastier insults.
You've a fine talent for that if for nothing else.
James! There's no reason to scold Jamie!
For God's sake, Papa, if you're gonna start that stuff I'll beat it.
God, Papa. I should think you'd get sick of hearing yourself.
You mustn't mind Edmund, James.
Remember he isn't well. A summer cold makes anyone irritable.
It's not just a cold he's got.
The kid is damn sick.
Why do you say that? It is just a cold, anyone can tell that. You always imagine things.
All Jamie meant is he may have a touch of something else which makes his cold worse.
Sure, Mama. That's all I meant.
Dr. Hardy thinks it might be a bit of malarial fever he caught when he was in the tropics.
Dr. Hardy! I wouldn't believe a thing he said if he swore it on a stack of bibles.
I know what doctors are, they're all alike, anything, they don't care what to keep you coming to them.
What is it?
What...? What are you looking at?
Is my hair coming down? or... something?
There's nothing wrong with your hair.
The fatter and healthier you are, the vainer you became.
You'll soon spend half the day primping before the mirror.
My eyes are so bad now, I really should have new glasses.
Your eyes are beautiful
- And well you know it.
- James, you mustn't be so silly.
- And right in front of Jamie.
- He's onto you now too.
He knows all this talk about eyes and hair is only fishing for compliments.
Ey, Jamie?
- Yes, you can't kid us, Mama.
- Get along with, both of you.
But I... I did truly have... have beautiful hair once.
Didn't I, James?
Most beautiful in the world
It.. it was a rare shade of... of reddish brown and so long it came down below my knees
You ought to remember it too, Jamie.
It wasn't until after Edmund was born that I had a single grey hair.
And that made it prettier than ever.
Will you listen to your father, Jamie.
After 35 years of marriage...
He isn't a great actor for nothing, is he?
What's come over you, James?
Are you pouring coals of fire on my head for teasing you about your snoring?
Well, then I take it all back.
It must've been ONLY the foghorn I heard.
Well...
I can't stay here any longer, even to hear compliments.
I have to see the cook about diner and the day's marketing.
That Bridgette is so lazy and so sly she begins telling me about her relatives so I can't get a word in edgeways to scold her.
Well...
I may as well get it over with.
Don't make Edmund work on the grounds with you, James, remember?
Not that he isn't strong enough, but he'd perspire and he might catch more cold.
You're a fine lunkhead!
Haven't you any sense?
Don't you know the one thing to avoid is saying anything that would get her more upset over Edmund?
All right. Have it your way.
I still think it's the wrong idea to let Mama go on kidding herself.
It will only make the shock worse when she has to face it.
Anyway, you can see she's deliberately fooling herself with that summer cold talk.
She knows better.
- Knows? Nobody knows yet.
- Well, I do.
I was with Edmund when he went to see Doc Hardy on Monday.
I heard him pull that touch of malaria stuff.
He was stalling.
That isn't what he thinks any more.
You know it as well as I do.
You talked to him when you went uptown yesterday, didn't you?
He can't say anything for sure yet.
He's to phone me today before
Edmund goes to him.
He thinks it's consumption, doesn't he, Papa?
He said it might be.
That poor kid!
Goddamnit!
It might never have happened if you'd sent him to a real doctor when he first got sick.
What's the matter with Hardy'? He's always been our doctor up here.
Hardy only charges a dollar.
That's what makes you think he's a fine doctor!
If you mean I can't afford one of the fine society doctors who prey on the rich summer people
Can't afford'? You're one of the biggest property owners around here.
That doesn't mean I'm rich.
If Edmund was a lousy acre of land you wanted, the sky would be the limit.
- That's a lie.
And your sneers against
Dr. Hardy are lies too.
I reckon I'm a fool to argue.
You can't change the leopard's spots.
No you CAN'T. You've taught me that lesson only too well, I've lost all hope you'll ever change yours.
You dare tell me what I can afford!
You've never known the value of a dollar in your life and you never will.
At the end of each season you're penniless.
You've thrown your salary away every week on whores and whiskey.
My salary!? God!
More than you're worth. You couldn't get that if it wasn't for me. If you weren't my son, there's not a manager in the business that would give you a part.
Your reputation stinks you. As it is
I have to humble my pride and beg for you, say you've turned over a new leaf although I know it's a lie.
I never wanted to be an actor.
- You forced me on the stage.
- That's a lie! You left it to me to get you a job and I've no influence except in the theater.
Forced you?! You never wanted to do anything except loaf in bar rooms.
After all the money I wasted on your education... and all you did was get fired and disgraced from every college you went.
Well, for God's sake don't drag up that ancient history!
It's not ancient history that you have to come back every summer to live on me.
Well, I earn my board and lodging working on the grounds.
It saves you hiring a man.
You have to be driven even to do that much.
I wouldn't give a damn if you ever displayed the slightest sign of gratitude.
The only thanks is to have you sneer at me for a dirty miser, sneer at my profession, sneer at every damned thing in the world—except yourself.
That's not true, Papa.
You can't hear me talking to myself, that's all.
“Ingratitude, the vilest weed that grows”!
God! I could see that line coming!
God, how many thousand times—!
All right, Papa. I'm a bum.
You're young yet. You could still make your mark.
You had the talent to become a fine actor!
You have it still. You're my son...!
Let's forget me. I'm not interested in the subject and neither are you.
What started us on this?
Oh, Doc Hardy!
When is he going to call you up about Edmund?
Around lunch time.
The less you say about Edmund's sickness, the better for your conscience! You're more responsible than anyone!
That's a lie! I won't stand for that, Papa!
It's the truth!
He grew up admiring you as a hero!
If you ever gave him advice except in the ways of rottenness,
I've never heard of it!
You made him old before his time, pumping him full of what you consider worldly wisdom, when he was too young to see that your mind was so poisoned by your own failure in life, you wanted to believe every man was a knave with his soul for sale, and every woman who wasn't a whore was a fool!
All right. All right. I did put him wise to a few things, but not until after I'd seen he'd started to raise hell, and would only laugh at me if I pulled that good advice, older brother stuff.
All I did was make a pal of him and be absolutely frank so he'd learn from my mistakes that
Well, that if you can't be good you can at least be careful.
That's a rotten accusation, Papa.
You know how much that kid means to me, and how close we've always been not like the usual brothers!
I'd do anything for him.
I know you may have thought it was for the best. I didn't say you did it deliberately to harm him.
Besides it's damned rot!
I'd like to see anyone influence Edmund any more than he wants to be.
What had I to do with all the crazy stunts he's pulled in the last few years working his way all over the map as a sailor and all that stuff.
No, thanks! I'll stick to Broadway, and a room with a bath, and bars that served bonded Bourbon.
You and Broadway! It's made you what you are!
Whatever Edmund's done, he's had the guts to go off on his own, where he couldn't come whining to me the minute he was broke.
He's always come home broke finally, hasn't he? And what's his going away get him?
Look at him now!
God! That's a lousy thing to say.
I didn't mean that.
He's been doing well on the paper. You used to talk about becoming a newspaper man but you were never willing to start at the bottom, you expected...
Oh for God's sake, Papa!
Can't you lay off me?
Damnable luck, Edmund should be sick right now, it couldn't have come at a worse time for him.
Or for your mother.
It's damnable she should have this to upset her just when she needs peace and freedom from worry.
She's been so well in the two months since she came home.
It's been heaven to me.
This home's been a real home again.
- But I needn't tell you, Jamie.
- No. I felt the same way, Papa.
Yes. She's been a different woman entirely from the other times.
She's control of her nerves, or she had until Edmund got sick.
Now you can feel her growing tense and frightened underneath.
I wish to God we could keep the truth from her but we can't if he's to be sent to a sanatorium.
What makes it worse is her father died of consumption.
She worshipped him. She's never forgotten it.
Yes it'll be hard for her.
But she can do it! She's the willpower now.
We must help her, Jamie.
In every way we can.
Of course, Papa.
Outside of nerves she seems perfectly alright this morning.
Yes, never better, she's full of fun and mischief.
Why do you say 'seems'?
Why shouldn't she be alright?
What the hell do you mean?
Don't start jumping down my throat.
God! Papa.
This ought to be one thing we can talk over, frankly, without a battle.
I'm sorry, Jamie.
But go on and tell me.
There's nothing to tell.
I was all wrong.
It's just that... last night...
Well, you know how it is, Papa.
I can't forget the past.
I can't help being suspicious anymore than you can.
That's the hell of it.
And it makes it hell for Mama.
- She watches us watching her.
- I know.
Well, what was it?
Can't you speak up?
Around 3 o'clock this morning, I woke up and I heard Mama moving around in the spare room.
Then she went to the bathroom. Now,
I pretended to be asleep and she stopped outside in the hall to listen as if she wanted to make sure I was.
For God's sake! Is that all?
She told me herself the foghorn kept her awake all last night. And every night since
Edmund's been sick she's been up and down going to his room to see how he was.
Yes, that's right. She did stop to listen outside his room.
But it was her being in the spare room that scared me.
Papa, I can't help remembering that when she starts sleeping alone in there it's always been a sign.
But it isn't this time. It's easily explained. Where else could she go last night to get away from my snoring?
How you can live with a mind that sees nothing but the worse motives behind everything is beyond me.
Don't pull that! I just said I was all wrong.
I suppose I'm as glad of that as you are.
Yes. Yes. I'm sure you are, Jamie.
It's been like a curse she can't escape if worry over Edmund.
It was her long sickness after bringing him into the world that she first ..
She didn't have anything to do with it.
I'm not blaming her.
Well, who are you blaming?
Edmund? For being born?
- You damn fool, no one was to blame.
- That bastard of a doctor was.
From what Mama said he was another cheap quack like Hardy.
You wouldn't pay for a first class doctor.
You liar!
So I'm to blame, am I? That's what you're driving at.
You evil minded loafer.
- What were you two arguing about?
- Same old stuff.
I heard you saying something about a doctor and your father accusing you of being evil minded.
Oh That? Well, I was just saying again that Doc Hardy isn't my idea of the world's greatest physician.
No. No. I wouldn't say he was either.
That Bridgette! I... I thought
I'd never get away. She told me all about her second cousin on the police force in St. Louis.
Well, if you're going to work on the hedge, why don't you go?
I... I mean... take advantage of the sunshine before the fog comes back.
Because I... I know it will.
That is... The rheumatism in my hands knows it.
It's a better weather prophet than you are, James.
How ugly they are. Who would ever believe they were once beautiful.
Now, now, Mary...
None of that foolishness.
They're the sweetest hands in the world.
Come on, Jamie!
The way to start work is to start work.
The hot sun will sweat some of that booze fat off your middle.
We're all so proud of you, Mama, so darn happy!
But you've still got to be careful.
I mean you mustn't worry so much about Edmund.
He'll be all right.
Of course he'll be all right
And I.. I don't know what you mean.
Warning me to be careful...
All right, Mama. I'm sorry I spoke.
Here you are! I was just going upstairs to look for you.
I didn't want to mix up in any arguments, I feel too rotten.
I'm sure you don't feel half as bad as you make out, you're such a baby.
You like to get us worried so we'll make a fuss over you... No, no. I'm only teasing you dear, I know how miserably uncomfortable you must be.
But you feel better today, don't you?
All the same you... you've grown much too thin.
Come on, sit down.
All you need is your mother to nurse you.
Because you are, you're still the baby of the family to me you know?
Never mind me, you take care of yourself.
That's all that counts.
- But I am.
Heavens! Don't you see how fat I've grown?
I'll have to have all my dresses let out.
They started clipping the hedge.
Poor Jamie. How he hates working in front where everyone passing can see him.
Not that I want anything to do with them. I've always hated this place and everyone in it.
But your father liked it and insisted on building this house and
I've had to come here every summer.
It was wrong from the start.
Everything was done in the cheapest possible way.
Your father would never spend the money to make it right.
It's just as well we haven't any friends. I'd be ashamed to have them step in the door.
But... yo... your father has never wanted family friends.
All he likes is to hobnob with men, in bar-rooms or at the club.
You and Jamie are the same way.
But you're not to blame.
I know it's useless to talk but... sometimes I... I feel so lonely.
You've got to be fair, Mama.
It may have been all his fault in the beginning but you know that latter on, even if he'd wanted to, we couldn't have had people here.
Don't I... I can't bear having you remind...
Don't take it that way please, Mama.
I'm trying to help.
Because it's bad for you to forget, the right way is to remember then you'll always be on your guard.
I... I don't understand why you should suddenly say such things.
What put it in your mind this morning?
Nothing, it just... well I... b... because I feel rotten and blue I suppose.
- Tell me the truth.
Why you so... suspicious all of a sudden?
I'm not.
Yes you are, I feel it.
Your father and Jamie too, particularly...
Now don't start imagining things, Mama.
It makes it so much harder living in this atmosphere of constant suspicion, knowing everyone is spying on me, that none of you believe in me or trust me.
- That's crazy, Mama. We do trust you.
- If there was only some place...
...I could go to get away for a day or even an afternoon, some woman friend
I could talk to, not about anything serious.
Simply laugh and gossip and forget for a while.
Someone besides the servants, that stupid Cathleen.
Stop it, Mama. You're getting yourself worked up over nothing.
Your father goes out, he meets his friends in bar-rooms or at the club. You and
Jamie have the boys, you know, you go out but I'm alone I've always been alone.
Now you know that's a fib, one of us always stays around to keep you company.
Because you're afraid to trust me alone.
I insist you tell me why you... act so differently this morning.
Why you felt you had to remind me.
It's stupid, it's just because I wasn't asleep when you came into my room last night.
You didn't go back to your and Papa's room you went into the spare room for the rest of the night.
Because your father's snoring was driving me crazy. For heavens sake!
Haven't I often used the spare room as my bedroom?
But I...
I see what you thought, that was...
- I didn't think that...
So... you were... you were pretending to be asleep, in order to spy on me.
No, I did it because I knew if you found out
I was feverish and couldn't sleep you'd be upset.
Jamie was pretending to be asleep too, I'm sure and I suppose your father...
- Stop it, Mama.
Oh, Edmund! I can't bear it when even you... It would serve all of you right if it was true.
Mama, don't say that!
That's the way you...
Stop suspecting me!
Please dear. You hurt me.
I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about you.
Th-that's the real reason.
I've been so worried ever since you got sick.
That's foolishness, you know it's just a bad cold.
Yes. Yes, of course, I know that.
But listen, Mama. I want you to promise me that even if it should turn out to be something worse.
You know I'll soon be all right again anyway.
No! No!
And you won't worry yourself sick about it and you'll keep on taking care of yourself.
No! No! I won't listen when you're so silly.
There's absolutely no reason to talk as if you expected something dreadful.
Of course I promise you. I give you my sacred word of honor.
But I suppose you're remembering...
I've promised before. I've no word of honor
- No.
- I'm not blaming you dear. How can you help it?
How can any of us forget?
That's what makes it so... hard for all of us we can't... forget.
. Stop it, Mama!
Alright dear. I didn't mean to be so gloomy.
Don't mind me.
Here, let me feel your head.
Well! It's nice and cool, you certainly haven't any fever now.
Forget me, it's you.
But I... I'm quite alright dear except I...
I naturally feel... tired and nervous this morning after such a bad night
I... I really... ought to go upstairs... and lie down until lunch time and take a nap
What are you gonna do? Read? Here?
It's be much better for you if you... went out in the... fresh air, sunshine.
Don't get overheated remember, be sure and wear a hat.
Or are you afraid to trust me alone?
Can't you stop talking like that?
I think you ought to take a nap.
I'll go out and help Jamie bear up.
I love to lie in the shade and watch him work.
It'll be lunch time soon, will I call your father and Mr. Jamie or will you?
- You do it.
Oh and you'd better call my mother too.
What for? She's always on time without any calling.
God bless her she has some consideration for the help.
She's taking a nap.
She wasn't asleep when I finished my work upstairs a while back.
She was lying down in the spare room with her eyes wide open.
She had a terrible headache, she said.
Oh well then... just call my father.
No wonder my feet kill me each night.
Mr. Tyrone! Mr. Jamie! It's time!
Sneaking one? Cut out the bluff kid, you're a rottener actor than I am.
Grabbing while the going was good.
Why don't you sneak one while you got a chance?
Yeah I was thinking of that little thing.
Hey! The old man was out there talking to old Captain Turner.
Yup, he's still at it.
You don't think that’ll fool him, do ya?
Well... maybe not... but he can't prove it.
God! I hope he doesn't forget lunch listening to himself talk.
I'm hungry.
That's what I hate working out down at the front. He puts on an act for every damn fool that comes along.
You're in luck to be hungry.
The way I feel I don't care if
I ever eat again.
Look kid... you know I never lectured you but Doc Hardy was right when he told you to cut out the red eye.
Well, I'm going to after the--after he hands me the bad news this afternoon, a few before then won't make any difference.
Jamie... what do you think it is?
How the hell would I know?
I'm no doc.
Where's Mama?
Upstairs.
When did she go up?
Oh about the time you started working on the hedge I guess.
She said she was going to take a nap.
- You didn't tell me.
- Why should I? What about it?
She was tired out, she didn't get much sleep last night.
Yeah I know she didn't.
Damn foghorn kept me awake too.
She's... been upstairs alone all morning... you haven't seen her?
No, I was reading. I wanted to give her a chance to sleep.
Is she coming down to lunch?
- Of course.
No! No "Of course" about it.
She might not want any lunch or she might start having her meals alone upstairs.
- Cut out the--
- Well, it's happened hasn't it?
You're all wrong to suspect anything.
Cathleen saw her not long ago.
Mama didn't tell her she wouldn't be down for lunch.
Then she wasn't taking a nap.
No, not right then but she was lying down, Cathleen said.
- In the spare room?
- Yes! For Pete's sake what of it?
You damn fool! Why did you leave her alone so long?
Why didn't you stick around?
Because she accused me and you and Papa of spying on her all the time and not trusting her.
She made me feel ashamed. I know how rotten it must be for her.
And she promised on her sacred word of honor.
Well, you ought to know that doesn't mean...
It does this time.
That's what we though the other times.
Aw, look kid, I know you think
I'm a cynical bastard but remember I've seen more of this game than you have.
You never knew what was really wrong until you were in prep school. Papa and I kept it from you.
I was wise ten years or more before we had to tell you.
I know this game backward and
I've been thinking all morning of the way she acted last night when she thought we were asleep.
I haven't been able to think of anything else and now you tell me she got you to leave her alone upstairs all morning.
Alright kid. Don't start a battle with me.
I hope as much as you do I'm crazy.
You know I've been happy as hell because I'd really begun to believe that this time...
She's coming downstairs you win on that one
I guess I was a damn suspicious louse.
Damn it I wish I'd grabbed another drink
You mustn't cough like that it's bad for your throat. You don't want to get a sore throat on top of your cold do you?
But I seem always to be picking on you telling you "don't do this", "don't do that" forgive me dear it's just that I want to take care of you.
Oh I know that.
What about you, do you feel rested?
Ever so much better. I've been lying down ever since you went out it's what I needed after such a restless night, I don't feel nervous now.
- That's fine.
- Good heavens! How down in the mouth you look, Jamie.
What's the matter now?
Nothing.
I'd forgotten, you've been working on the front hedge that always account for your sinking into the dumps, doesn't it?
If you wanna think so, Mama.
Well, that's the effect it always has, isn't it?
What a big baby you are.
Isn't he, Edmund?
He's certainly a fool to care what anyone thinks. Yes.
The only way is to make yourself not care.
Where's your father?
I heard Cathleen call him.
She's down there now, interrupting the famous beautiful voice.
She should have more respect.
It's you who should have more respect.
You, who thanks to him have never had to work hard in your life.
Remember, your father is getting old, Jamie.
You really... ought to show more consideration.
I'm hungry, I wish that old man would get a move on.
It's a rotten trick the way he keeps meals waiting and then beefs because they're spoiled.
Very trying, Jamie. You don't know how trying, you don't have to keep up the house with summer servants who don't care because... because they know it isn't a permanent position.
Your father won't even pay the wages the best summer help ask so every year I have stupid lazy greenhorns to deal with.
But you've heard me say this a thousand times.
What makes you ramble on like that, Mama?
I don't know, nothing in particular dear.
It's foolish of me.
Lunch is ready ma'am. I went down to Mr. Tyrone like you ordered and he said he'd come right away but...
Alright Cathleen. Tell
Bridget I'm sorry but she'll have to wait a few minutes until Mr. Tyrone is here.
Yes ma'am.
Look damn it why don't we go in without him, he told us to.
He doesn't mean it.
Don't you know your father yet?
He'd be so terribly hurt.
I'll... I'll go make him get a move on.
Why do you stare like that?
- You know.
- I don't know.
For God's sake, Mama! You think you can fool me? I'm not blind.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No?
Take a look at your eyes, Mama.
I got Papa moving, he'll... he'll be here any minute.
What's the matter.
- Your brother...
- What happened, Mama?
Your brother ought to be ashamed of himself he's been insinuating...
I don't know what.
- God damn you!
- Stop it at once! Do it!
He's a liar!
- It's a lie, isn't it, Mama?
- What's a lie?
Edmund... don't.
Here comes your father up the steps, I must... warn Bridget.
Well?
Well... what?
You're a liar.
Sorry I'm late. Captain Turner stopped to talk, once he starts gabbing you can't get away from him.
- You mean once he starts listening.
It's all right, the level of the bottle hasn't changed.
I wasn't noticing that.
As if it proved anything with you about.
I'm on to your tricks.
Did I hear you say "let's all have a drink"?
Jamie's welcome after his hard morning's work but I won't invite you, Doctor Harding...
- To hell with Doc Hardy.
One isn't going to kill me.
I feel all in, Papa.
Well, come along then, it's before a meal.
I've always found that good whiskey, taken in moderation, as an appetizer, is the best of tonics.
I said "in moderation".
It'd be a waste of breath mentioning moderation to you.
Well... here's to health and happiness.
That's a joke!
What is?
Nothing. Here's to health.
Well, what's the matter here?
There's gloom in the air you could cut with a knife.
You got the drink you were after didn't you? Why are you wearing that gloomy look on your mug?
You won't be singing a song yourself soon.
Shut up, Jamie!
I thought lunch was ready.
I'm hungry as a hunter.
Where's your mother?
Here I am.
I've had to calm down Bridget.
She's in a tantrum over you being late again and I don't blame her.
If your lunch is dried up from waiting in the oven she said you could like it or leave it for all she cared
I'm so sick and tired of pretending this is a home! You won't help me.
You won't put yourself out the least bit
You don't know how to act in a home, you don't even want one.
You've never have wanted one since we were married.
You should have remained a bachelor and lived in second rate hotels.
Entertained your friends in bar-rooms and nothing ever would've happened...
- Mama!
Stop talking.
Why don't we go in to lunch?
Yes. Yes. It is inconsiderate of me to dig up the past when I know your father and Jamie must be hungry.
I do hope you have an appetite dear.
You really must eat more...
Why is that glass there?
Did you have a drink?
How can you be such a fool?
You're to blame, James!
How could you let him?
Do you want to kill him?!
Don't you remember my father?
He wouldn't stop after he was stricken, he said doctors were fools, he thought like you that whiskey is a good tonic...
But of course... there... there... there's no comparison...
...at all, is there?
I... I don't know why I... I...
Forgive me for... scolding you, James.
One... one small drink won't hurt, Edmund.
Might be good for him.
If it gives him an appetite.
For God's sake let's eat.
- Come on kid, let's put on the feed bag.
- Yes
You go in with your mother lads.
I'll join you in a second.
Why... why do you... look at me like that?
Please stop staring, James.
One would think you're accusing me.
James...
...you don't understand...
I understand that I've been a god damned fool to believe in you.
I don't know what you mean by "believing" in me, all I felt was distrust and spying and suspicion.
Why are you having another drink?
You never have more than one drink before lunch.
Well... I know what to expect, you'll be drunk tonight and it won't be the first time, will it?
Or the thousandth.
James... please... please...
...you don't understand...
I've been so worried... so worried about Edmund.
I'm so afraid.
I don't want to listen to your excuses, Mary.
Excuses?
You... you mean... you couldn't believe that of me.
You mustn't believe that, James. No.
Shall... shall we not go in to lunch, dear?
I don't want anything, but I know you must be hungry.
James...
I tried... so hard.
I tried so hard!
- Please believe me.
- Yes I suppose you did, Mary.
But for the love of
God why couldn't you have the strength to keep on?
I... I don't know what you're talking about.
Have the strength to keep on what?
Never mind.
It's no use now.
It's unreasonable to expect
Bridget and Cathleen to act as if this were home, they know it isn't as well as we know it.
Never has been and never will be.
No it never can be now but it was once before you...
Before I what?
No... no dear, whatever you say, it isn't true.
It was never a home. You've always preferred a club or a bar-room.
And for me it's... always been as lonely a dirty room in a one night stand hotel.
I'm... I'm worried about you.
Edmund.
Edmund. You... you hardly touched anything.
It's alright for me not to have an appetite, I've...
I've been growing too fat but...
...you must eat.
Pro... promise me you will dear, for my sake.
- Yes, Mama.
- That's a good boy.
I'll answer. Maguire said he'd call.
Hello.
How are you doctor?
Well, the... you'll explain all about it when you see him this afternoon.
Yes he... he'll be with you without fail at 4 o'clock.
Yes.
Yes.
Goodbye. Goodbye doctor.
Well, that didn't sound like glad tidings.
It was doctor hardy
He wants to... you to be sure and see him at 4 this afternoon.
What did he say?
Not that I give a damn.
I wouldn't believe him if he swore on a stack of bibles.
Don't pay attention to a word he says, Edmund.
Mary!
We all know why you like him
James, because he's cheap.
Please don't try to tell me, I know all about Doctor Hardy.
Heaven knows I ought to after all these years.
He's an ignorant fool.
Should be a law to keep man like him from practicing.
He hasn't the slightest idea... when you're in agony and half insane.
Sits and holds your hand and delivers sermons on willpower.
He deliberately humiliates you.
He makes you beg and plead.
He treats you like a criminal.
He understands nothing!
And yet it was exactly the same type of cheap quack who first gave you the medicine and you never knew what it was until it was too late.
I hate doctors!
For Christ's sake, Mama!
Stop talking.
Yes, Mary, it's no time to...
You're... you're... quite right dear, forgive me.
I... It's useless to be angry now.
I'm going upstairs... for a moment.
If you'll excuse me.
I have to fix my hair.
That is, if I can find my glasses.
- I'll be right down.
- Mary.
Yes dear, what is it?
- Nothing.
- You're welcome to come up and watch me if you're so suspicious.
As if that could do any good, you'd only postpone it.
I'm not your jailer, this isn't a prison.
No, I know you can't help thinking it's a home.
I'm sorry dear.
I don't mean to be bitter.
It... It's not your fault.
- Another shot in the arm.
- Cut out that kind of talk.
Yes, hold your foul tongue and your rotten Broadway loafers lingo! Have you no pity or decency? You ought to be thrown out into the gutter
If I did it you know damn well who would weep you and plead for you and excuse you and complain until I let you come back.
God! Don't I know that?
No pity?
I have all the pity in the world for her because I understand what a hard game to beat she is up against.
Which is more than you ever had
No, the cures are no damn good except for a while. The truth is there is no cure and we've been saps to hope.
- They never come back.
- "They never come back"
Everything's in the bag, it's all a frame up we're all fall guys and suckers and we can't beat the game.
- God, if I felt the way you do...
- I thought you did! Your poetry isn't very cheery nor the stuff you read and claim to admire.
Shut up both of you! There's little choice between the philosophy you learn from Broadway loafers and the one Edmund got from his books.
They're both rotten to the core. You both flaunted the faith you were born and brought up in, the one true faith of the catholic church and your denial has brought nothing but self-destruction.
That's the bunk, Papa.
We don't pretend at any rate.
I don't notice you've worn any holes in the knees of your pants going to mass.
It's true, I'm a bad catholic in the observance.
God forgive me. But I believe.
And you're a liar, I may not go to church but every night and morning of my life I get down on my knees and pray.
Did you pray for Mama?
I did, I've prayed to God these many years for her.
But what's the good of talk?
Only, I wish she hadn't led me into hope this time.
By God! I never will again.
That's a rotten thing to say, Papa.
Well, I'll hope, she's only just started, it can't have got a hold on her yet, she can still stop.
You can't talk to her now, she'll listen but she won't listen.
Yes, every day from now on will be the same drifting away from us until at the end of each night...
Cut it out, Papa!
I'll go up and get dressed.
I'll make so much noise she can't suspect I've come up to spy on her.
What did Doc Hardy say about the kid?
It's what you thought... he's got consumption.
Damn it!
There's no possible doubt, he says.
Aw hell, he'll have to go to a sanatorium.
Yes. The sooner the better, Hardy says, for him and everyone around him.
He claims: in six months to a year,
Edmund will be cured, if he obeys orders.
Who would have thought a child of mine?
Doesn't come from my side of the family.
Wasn't one of us who didn't have lungs as strong as an ox!
Who gives a damn about that part of it?
Where does Hardy want to send him?
That's what I've to see him about.
Well, for God's sake pick out a good place and not some cheap dump.
I'll send him wherever
Hardy thinks best.
Well, don't give Hardy your old over the hills to the poor house song about taxes and mortgages
I'm no millionaire that can throw money away.
Why shouldn't I tell Hardy the truth?
Because he'll think you want him to pick a cheap dump.
And because he'll know it isn't the truth, especially if he hears afterwards you've seen McGuire and let that flannel-mouth, gold-brick merchant sting you with another piece of bum property!
Keep your nose out of my business!
This is Edmund's business!
What I'm afraid of is, with your Irish bogtrotter idea that consumption is fatal you'll figure it's a waste of money to spend any more than you can help
- You liar!
- All right, prove I'm a liar!
That's what I want, that's why I brought it up.
I have every hope Edmund will be cured.
And keep your dirty tongue off Ireland.
You're a fine one to sneer with a map of it on your face.
Not after I wash my face.
Well... I've said all I have to say, it's up to you.
What do you want me to do this afternoon now that you're going uptown?
I've done all I can do on the hedge until you cut more of it and you don't want me to go ahead with your clipping I know that.
No, you'd get it crooked.
Like you get everything else.
Well, I'd better go uptown with Edmund then.
Bad news coming on top of what's happened with Mama may hit him hard.
Yes, go with him, Jamie. Keep up his spirits if you can.
If you can without making it an excuse to get drunk.
What would I use for money?
The last I heard they were still selling booze not giving it away.
I'll get dressed.
You haven't... seen my... glasses anywhere, have you, Jamie?
You haven't seen them, have you, James?
No my dear.
What's the matter with, Jamie?
Have you been nagging at him again?
You really sh... shouldn't treat him with such contempt all the time.
He's not to blame, if he'd been brought up in a real home I'm sure it would have been dif...
You're not much of a weather prophet, James.
See how hazy it's getting.
I can hardly see the other shore.
Yes I spoke too soon we're in for another night of fog I'm afraid.
Well... I won't mind it tonight.
No. I don't imagine you will...
Mary.
I... I don't see Jamie going down to the hedge.
Where... where did he go?
He's going with Edmund to the doctor's, he went upstairs to change his clothes.
I have to do the same or I'll be late for my appointment.
Please wait a little while.
At least until one of the boys... comes down.
You... you'll all be... leaving me so soon.
It's you who are leaving us, Mary.
Well, that... that's a silly thing to say, James.
How could I leave?
There's nowhere I could go.
Who would I go to see?
- I have no friends.
- That's your own fault.
Surely there's something that you could do this afternoon that would be good for you, Mary.
Take a drive in the automobile, get away from the house get a little sun and fresh air.
I bought the automobile for you.
You know I don't care for the damn things, I'd rather walk any day or take the trolly.
I had it here waiting for you when you came back from the sanatorium.
I thought it would give you pleasure and distract your mind.
You used to ride in it every day, you hardly use it at all lately.
Paid more money than
I could afford.
There's the chauffeur, I have to feed and board and pay high wages whether he drives you or not.
Waste!
Same old waste that will land me in the poor house at my old age.
What good has it done you?
I might as well have thrown the money out the window.
It was a waste of money, James.
You shouldn't have bought a second hand automobile.
You were swindled again.
As you always are because you insist on second hand bargains in everything.
It's one of the best makes.
You're as bad as Jamie.
Suspecting everyone.
No. You mustn't be offended, James.
I wasn't offended when you gave me the automobile.
I knew that was the way you had to do everything.
I was grateful and touched.
I knew that buying the car was a... was a hard thing for you to do.
But it showed how much you love me... in your way.
Especially... as you couldn't really believe it would do me any good.
- Mary, dear Mary.
For the love of God, for the boys sake, for my sake and for your own, won't you stop? Now.
Stop what? What are you talking about?
James...
James we've loved each other, we always will.
Let's remember only that and not try to understand what we cannot understand or help things that cannot be helped.
The things... life has done to us, we cannot excuse or explain.
You won't even try?
Try... try to go for a drive?
This afternoon dear?
Yes... Yes I... I will if you wish it.
Although... it... it makes me feel lonelier... than if I stayed here.
There... there's no one I can invite to drive with me.
I never know where to tell Smythe to go
If there was only some friend's house where I could... drop in laugh and gossip over a while.
But of course there isn't.
Never has been.
At the convent, I had so many friends.
Naturally, after I married an actor, well... you... you know how actors were considered in those days and then of course... right after we were married there was the scandal of... of that... woman who... had been your mistress suing you. From then on all my old friends either pitied me or... cut me dead.
I hated the ones that cut me dead much less than the pitiers.
Mary for God's sake don't dig up what's long forgotten.
If you're that far gone in the past already when it's only the beginning of the afternoon what will you be tonight.
Come to think of it... I do have to drive uptown.
There's something I must get at the drugstore.
Yes. Leave it to you to have some of the stuff hidden and prescriptions for more.
Well, I hope you'll lay in a good stock ahead so we'll never have another night like the one when you screamed for it, and ran out of the house in your nightdress half crazy to try and throw yourself off the dock.
I have to get... tooth powder... and toilet soap... and cold cream.
You mustn't remember, you mustn't humiliate me so!
Forgive me.
I'm sorry, Mary.
It doesn't matter, nothing like that ever happened.
You must've dreamed it.
I... I was so... so healthy before Edmund was born.
Do you remember, James?
There wasn't a nerve in my body.
Even travelling with you, season after season and bearing children in hotel rooms, I still kept healthy.
But bearing Edmund was... the last straw.
I was so sick afterwards.
And that ignorant quack of a cheap hotel doctor all he knew was I was in pain, it was easy for him to stop the pain.
Mary, for God's sake forget the past.
Why how can I, the past is the present, it's the future too, isn't it?
I blame only myself.
I swore after Eugene died I would never have another baby.
I was to blame for his death.
If... If I hadn't left him with my mother to join you on the road because you wrote telling me you missed me and were so lonely
Jamie would never have been allowed when he still had measles to go into the baby's room.
I always believed Jamie did it on purpose.
He was jealous of the baby.
He hated him.
I know Jamie was only seven but he was never stupid.
He'd been warned it might kill the baby.
He knew. I've never been able to forgive him for that.
Are you back to Eugene now? Can't you let our dead baby rest in peace?
Above all... above all I should never have let you insist that I have another baby to take Eugene's place.
I was afraid, all the time I carried Edmund.
I knew something terrible would happen. I knew I'd proved by the way I left Eugene that I wasn't worthy to have another baby.
And that God would punish me if I did.
I should never have born Edmund.
Mary be careful with your talk, if he heard you he might think you never wanted him.
For God's sake try and be yourself, you can do that much for him.
There you are, you look spick-and-span.
I'm on my way up to change too.
Wait a minute, Papa. I hate to bring up disagreeable topic but there's the matter of car fare.
I'm broke.
You'll always be broke until you learn the value of...
...but you've been learning, lad.
You worked hard before you took ill.
You've done splendidly, I...
I'm proud of you.
"Thank you". How sharper than a snake's tooth it is to...
"...have a thankless child", I know. Give me a chance, Papa. I'm knocked speechless.
This isn't a dollar, it's a ten spot.
But why all of a sudden?
Did doc. Hardy say I was going to die?
That was a rotten crack. I was just kidding, Papa.
- I'm very grateful, honest, Papa.
- You're welcome, lad.
I won't have it! Do you hear?
Such morbid nonsense.
Saying you're going to die.
You think you didn't want to live.
A boy of your age, with everything before him.
It's just a pose you get out of books.
You're not really sick at all!
- Mary, hold your tongue!
- But James, it's absurd of him to be so gloomy and to make such a big to-do about nothing.
But never mind dear, I'm on to you.
You want to be petted and spoiled and made a fuss over, isn't that it?
You're still such a baby.
But please, don't carry it too far dear.
Don't say horrible things.
I know it's foolish to take them seriously but
I can't help it. You've got me so frightened!
I believe you ought to ask your mother now what you said you were... going to.
My God! Look at the time.
I have to shake a leg.
How do you feel?
Your head is a little hot... but that's just from going out in the sun.
You look ever so much better than you did this morning.
Come and sit down.
- Listen, Mama...
- No, no, don't talk. Sit down. Lean back.
And rest.
It's such a tiring trip uptown in the dirty old trolley on a hot day like this.
You'll be ever so much better off here with me.
Listen, Mama...
You could telephone Hardy.
Tell him you don't feel well enough.
The old idiot, all he knows about medicine is to look solemn and preach willpower.
- Listen, Mama...
I want to ask you something...
You can still stop.
You've only just started, you've got the willpower we'll all help you,
I'll do anything.
Won't you, Mama?
Please don't talk about things you don't understand.
All right I give up.
I knew it was no use.
Anyway I don't know what you're referring to but I do know you should be the last one...
Right after I returned from the sanatorium you began to be ill.
But after they had warned me
I must have peace at home with nothing to upset me all
I've done is worry about you.
But... that's no excuse.
I'm only trying to explain, it's not an excuse.
Promise me dear you won't believe I made you an excuse.
What else can I believe?
Nothing. I don't blame you.
How can you believe me when
I can't believe myself?
I've become such a liar.
I never lied about anything once upon a time.
Now I have to lie, especially to myself.
But how can you understand when
I can't understand myself?
I've never understood anything about it, except. That one day long ago I found I could no longer call my soul my own.
But someday dear...
I'll find it again.
Someday when you're all well.
And I see you healthy and happy and successful.
And I don't have to feel guilty anymore.
Someday... when the blessed virgin Mary forgives me.
And gives me back the faith in her love and pity I used to have in my convent days.
And I can pray to her again.
When she sees... no one can believe in me, even for a moment, anymore... then she will believe in me... and with her help it will be so easy.
I will hear myself scream with agony and yet at the same time I will laugh because I will be so sure of myself.
Well... but of course you can't... believe that either can...
Now I... now I think of it you might as well... go uptown.
I forgot. I'm taking a drive.
I have to go to the drugstore and you'd hardly want to go there with me would you?
You'd be so ashamed.
Mama, don't...
I suppose you'll divide that $10 your father gave you with, Jamie.
You always divide with each other, don't you?
Like good sports.
Well... I know what he'll do with his share.
He'll get drunk somewhere where he can be with the only kind of woman he understands or likes.
Edmund... promise me you won't drink.
It's so dangerous. You know doctor Hardy...
I thought he was an old idiot...
Edmund...
Come on kid, let's beat it!
Go on, Edmund.
Jamie's calling.
There comes your father down the stairs too.
Come on! Edmund.
- Goodbye, Mary.
- Goodbye, Edmund.
If you're coming home to dinner try not to be late.
Tell your father, you know how Bridget is.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mama.
So lonely here.
You're lying to yourself again.
You wanted to get rid of them.
Their contempt and disgust aren't pleasant company.
You're glad they've gone.
Then mother of God... why do I feel so lonely?
That foghorn... isn't it awful?
Yes indeed ma'am.
Wasn't the fog I minded,
I really love fog.
They say it's good for the complexion.
It hides you from the world and the world from you.
You feel everything has changed, nothing is what it seemed to be.
No one can find or touch you anymore.
I was scared out of my wits riding back from town.
You couldn't see your hand in front of you.
It's the foghorn I hate.
It won't let you alone.
It keeps reminding you... calling you back.
But it can't tonight, it's just an ugly sound.
It's...
It doesn't remind me of anything, except perhaps Mr. Tyrone's snores.
I've had such fun teasing him about it.
He's always snored... ever since I can remember, especially when he's had too much to drink. And then he's like a child, he doesn't like to admit it.
Well... I suppose I snore at times too and I don't like to admit it.
So I've no right to make fun of him, have I?
Sure everybody healthy snores, it's a sign of sanity they say.
What time is it ma'am? I ought to be getting back into the kitchen.
No, don't go Cathleen.
I don't want to be alone...
- ...yet.
- It won't be for long.
The master and the boys will be home soon.
I doubt if they'll come home for dinner.
They have too good an excuse... to remain in the bar-rooms... where they feel at home.
Have a drink yourself,
Cathleen, if you wish.
Well... I don't know if I'd better ma'am.
Well... maybe one won't harm.
Here's to your good health ma'am.
I really did have good health once
Cathleen but that was long ago.
For God's sake ma'am... it'll be half water.
He'll know by the taste.
By the time he gets home he'll be too drunk to tell the difference, he has such a good an excuse, he believes, to drown his sorrows.
Well... it's a good man's failing... never mind his weakness.
I don't mind, I've loved him dearly for thirty-six years.
That's right ma'am, love him dearly for any fool can tell he worships the ground you walk on.
Speaking of acting ma'am... how is it you never went on the stage?
What... I?
What put that absurd idea in your head?
I was brought up in a respectable home and educated in the best convent in the middle-west before
I met Mr. Tyrone.
I hardly knew there was such a thing as the theater.
I was a very pious girl.
I even dreamed of becoming a nun.
I never had the slightest desire to be an actress.
I'd never think of you being a holy nun ma'am.
Sure to God you'd never darken the door of a church God forgive me.
Well... I never felt at home in the theater.
Even though Mr. Tyrone has made me go with him on all his tours.
I've had... little to do with the people in his company.
Not that I had anything against them, they were always very kind to to me and I to them but... their life was not my life.
It's always stood between me and... and...
But let's not talk about old things that could not be helped.
How thick the fog is.
I... I can't see the road.
All the people in the world could pass by... and I would never know.
I wish it was always that way.
It's getting dark already.
It'll soon be night.
Thank goodness. It was kind of you to keep me company this afternoon Cathleen.
I should have been lonely driving up... driving uptown alone.
Sure. Why wouldn't I rather ride in a fine automobile than stay here?
It's like a vacation ma'am.
There's only one thing I didn't like.
What was that Cathleen.
The way the man in the drugstore acted when I took in the prescription for you.
The appearance of him.
I d... I don't know what you're talking about.
What drugstore? What prescrip...
Oh yes...
Of course, I'd forgotten.
The medicine for the... rheumatism... in my hands.
What did the man say?
Not that it matter so long as he filled the prescription.
Oh it mattered to me ma'am. I'm not used to being treated like a thief.
He gave me a long look and said insultingly
"where did you get hold of this?".
"Well" I says "it's none of your damn business" but if you must know it's for the lady I work for, Mrs. Tyrone who's sitting out there in the automobile.
That shut him up quick.
He gave a long look out and said "Ohh" and went to get the medicine.
Yes... he... knows me.
I... have to take it because there... there is no other that can... stop the pain.
All the pain.
I mean in my hands.
Poor hands.
You'll never believe it but they... they were once one of my good points along with my hair... and eyes.
I had a fine figure too.
They were a musician's hands.
I used to love the piano.
I worked so hard at my music at the convent.
Mother Elizabeth and my music teacher both said I had more talent than any student they remembered.
My father paid for special lessons.
He spoiled me. He would've sent me to Europe to study after I'd graduated from the convent.
I might have gone if I hadn't fallen in love with Mr. Tyrone or I might have become a nun.
I had two dreams.
To be a nun... that was the more beautiful one.
To be a concert pianist.
That was the other.
I haven't touched the piano in so many years. I couldn't play now with such crippled fingers even if I wanted to.
For a time after my marriage... I tried to keep up my music but it was hopeless. One night stands, cheap hotels, dirty trains, leaving children, never having a home.
See... Cathleen?
How ugly they are, so maimed and crippled.
You'd think they've been through some horrible accident.
So they have come to think of it.
I won't look at them, they are worst than the foghorn at reminding me.
But even they can't hurt me now.
They're far away.
I see them... but the pain is gone.
You've taken some of that medicine?
If I didn't know better I'd think you'd a drop taken.
It kills the pain.
You go back... until at last your... beyond it's reach.
Only the past when you were happy is real.
If you think Mr. Tyrone is handsome now, Cathleen, you should have seen him when I first met him.
He had a reputation of being one of the handsomest men in the country.
Those at the convent who'd seen him act or seen his photographs used to rave about him.
He was a big matinée idol then.
Women... used to wait at the stage door just to... see him come out.
You can imagine how... excited I was when my father wrote telling me he and James Tyrone had become friends and I was to meet him when I went home for my Easter vacation.
I showed the letter to all the girls.
How envious they were.
My father took me to see him act first.
It was a play about the French revolution and the... the leading character... was a nobleman.
I couldn't take my eyes off him.
I wept when he was thrown in prison and then was so mad because I was afraid my eyes would be red.
My... my father had said we would go backstage to his dressing room right after the play and so we did.
I guess my... eyes and nose... couldn't have been red after all.
I was really very pretty then actually and he was handsomer than my wildest dreams.
He was different... different from ordinary men like someone from another world.
I fell in love right then.
So did he.
He told me afterwards.
I forgot all about becoming a nun.
Or a concert pianist.
All I wanted was to be his wife.
Thirty-six years ago... but I can see it as clearly as if it were tonight.
And... we've loved each other ever since and in all those thirty-six years there... there's never been a breath of scandal about him.
I mean with another woman.
He's made me very happy Cathleen.
He's a fine gentleman.
You're a lucky woman.
Sentimental fool.
What's so wonderful about the first... meeting between a silly romantic schoolgirl... and a matinéer?
You were much... happier before... you knew he existed.
In the convent... when you could pray... to the blessed vi... virgin.
If only I could find the faith I lost.
So I could pray to her again.
Hail Mary, full of grace...
Hail Mary, full...
Hail Mary, full of...
Expect the blessed virgin to be fooled... by a lying dope fiend reciting words?
You can't fool her.
I haven't taken enough.
I have to go upstairs.
When you start again you never know...
You never know exactly how much you need.
Why are they coming back?
Why are they coming back?
Are you there... Mary?
Yes. Yes I'm... I'm here dear.
In the sitting room.
I've been... I've been waiting for you.
I'm... I'm so happy you've come. I'd given up hope.
I was afraid you wouldn't come home.
It's such a dismal foggy evening it must be much more cheerful in the bar-rooms uptown where there are people you can laugh and...
Oh no don't deny it.
I know how you feel. I don't blame you a bit.
I'm all the more grateful to you for coming home.
I was... sitting here so... lonely and blue.
Come and sit down.
Dinner won't be ready for a few minutes.
Your... your... actually a little early.
Will wonders never cease?
Here's the whiskey dear, shall I pour you a drink. And you, Edmund?
I don't want to encourage you.
But one small one be... be... before... dinner can't... do you any harm.
Where's Jamie?
But I... of course... he'll never come home so long as he has... the price of a date left.
I'm afraid Jamie has been..lost to us for a..long time..dear.
For the love of God, I'm a fool for coming home.
Papa, shut up.
Who would have... thought...
Jamie would... grow up to disgrace us.
Everyone liked him, all his... teachers told us what a fine brain he had.
They... they predicted a wonderful future for him if only he'd... learned to take life seriously.
Poor Jamie! Such a pity!
It's hard to understand.
No it isn't.
You brought him up to be a boozer.
Since he first opened his eyes he's seen you drinking.
Always a bottle on the bureau in the cheap hotel rooms.
If he had a nightmare when he was little or a stomach ache your remedy was to give him a tea spoon full of whiskey.
- To quiet him.
- So I'm to blame because that lazy hulk has made a drunken loafer of himself?
Is that what I came back to listen to?
I might have known. When you have the poison in you, you want to blame everyone but yourself!
Papa!
Are we going to have this drink or aren't we?
You're right. I'm a fool to take notice.
Drink hearty, lad.
I'm sorry if I... sounded bitter, James, I'm not.
It's all so far away I... I was a little hurt when you wished you hadn't come home. I was so relieved and happy when you came.
And grateful to you.
It's very dreary and sad to be here alone in the fog.
With night falling.
I'm glad I came, Mary, when you act like your real self.
I was so lonesome. I kept Cathleen with me just to have someone to talk to.
Do you know what I was telling her, James? About that night my father took me to your dressing room.
And I first fell in love with you, do you remember?
Can you think I'll ever forget, Mary?
No.
I know you still love me, James.
In spite of everything.
Yes, as God is my judge.
Always and forever, Mary.
And I... love you dear.
In spite of everything.
But...
Although I couldn't help loving you I would never have married you if I'd known you drank so much.
I remember the... first time your bar-room fellows had to help you... to the door of out hotel room and knocked and then ran away before I opened the door.
We... we were still in our honeymoon, remember?
I don't remember. It wasn't on our honeymoon.
I've never in my life had to be helped to bed or missed a performance.
I waited in that ugly hotel room... hour after hour.
I became terrified, I imagined all sorts of horrible accidents. I got down on my knees and prayed that nothing had happened to you.
Then they brought you up and left you outside the door.
God! No wonder.
I'm... I'm sorry I remembered out loud.
I don't want to be sad or to make you sad.
I want to remember only the happy part of the past.
Do you remember our wedding?
The wedding dear?
I... I... haven't made such a bad wife, have I?
I'm not complaining, Mary.
At least I've loved you dearly and I've done the best I could under the circumstances.
That wedding gown... was nearly the death of me.
And the dressmaker too.
I was so particular, it was never quite good enough.
At last she said she said she refused to touch it anymore "it might spoil it" so I made her leave so I could be alone to examine myself in the mirror.
I was so pleased and vain.
I thought to myself "you're just as pretty as any actress he's ever met and you don't have to use paint".
Wh... where is my wedding gown now I wonder.
I... I... I kept it wrapped up in tissue paper in my trunk.
I hoped someday I'd have a daughter and when it came time for her to marry she couldn't afford a lovely gown and I knew, James, you'd never tell her "never mind the cost".
You'd want her to pick up something at a bargain.
It was made of soft shimmering satin trimmed with wonderful old duchess lace around the neck and sleeves worked in with the folds that were draped around in a bustle effect at the back.
The bust was bound and very tight and then I...
I held my breath when it was fitted so my waist would be as small as possible.
My... my father...
...my father... even let me have lace on my white satin slippers and lace with orange blossoms in my veil.
How I loved that gown!
It was so...
...beautiful.
Where is it now I wonder.
I... I... I...
I used to take it out from time to time when I was lonely.
But it always made me cry and so... finally a long while ago...
I wonder where I hid it?
Probably in some old trunk in the attic, someday I must have a look.
Well, isn't it dinner time dear?
You're ever scolding me for being late but now
I'm on time for once, it's dinner that's late.
Well, if I can't eat yet, I can drink.
I forgot I had this.
Who's been tampering with my whiskey?
The damn stuff is half water.
Any fool can tell.
Mary, answer me.
I hope to God you haven't taken to drink on top of...
Shut up, Papa!
You treated Cathleen and
Bridget, isn't that it?
Yes. Yes I wanted to treat
Cathleen because I had her drive uptown with me and sent her to get my prescription filled.
For God's sake, Mama!
You can't trust her.
You want everyone on earth to know?
Know what?
That I suffer from rheumatism in my hands and have to take medicine to kill the pain?
Why should I be ashamed of that?
I never knew what rheumatism was before you were bo... born.
Ask your father.
Don't mind her, lad, it doesn't mean anything.
When it gets to the stage where she gives the old crazy excuse about her hands she's gone far away from us.
I'm glad you realize that, James.
Now perhaps you'll give up trying to remind me.
You and...
...Edmund.
Why don't you light the lights, James?
It's getting dark.
I know you hate to but
Edmund has proved to you that one bulb burning doesn't cost much.
It's too bad you let your fear of the poor house make you too stingy.
I never claimed one bulb costed much.
It's having them on one here one there makes the electric light company rich.
I'm a fool to talk sense to you.
I'll get a fresh bottle of whiskey, lad.
We'll have a real drink.
He'll sneak around....
...the outside cellar door so the...
...servants won't see him.
He's really ashamed of keeping his whiskey pad-locked in the cellar.
Your father is a strange man.
Took many years before I understood him.
His father deserted his mother and their six children a year or so after they came to America.
He told them he had a premonition he would die soon. He was homesick for Ireland and wanted to go there to die so he went and he did die.
He must have been a peculiar man too.
Your father had to go to work in a machine shop when he was only ten years...
- For Pete's sake, Mama!
Heard Papa tell that story ten thousand times.
Yes dear. You've had to listen. But I don't think you ever tried to understand.
Listen, Mama.
You're not so far gone yet that you've forgotten everything
You haven't asked me what I found out this afternoon.
Don't you care a damn?
- Don't say that. You hurt me dear.
- What I've got is serious, Mama.
Doc Hardy knows for sure.
That lying old quack! I warned you he'd invent...
He called in a specialist to examine me...
Don't tell me about doctor Hardy.
 ...so he'd be absolutely sure.
If you'd heard what the doctor in the sanatorium who really know something said about how he treated me.
He said it was a wonder I hadn't gone mad!
I told him I had once, that time
I ran down in my nightdress to throw myself off the dock.
You remember that, don't you?
And you want me to pay attention to what doctor Hardy says? Oh no.
Listen, Mama! I'm gonna tell you whether you want to hear it or not.
I've got to go away to a sanatorium.
No!
How dare your father allow him.
You're my baby.
I know why he wants to send you to a sanatorium.
To take you away from me.
He's been jealous of everyone of my babies and you most of all.
He knows I love you most because your my...
Stop talking crazy, can't you, Mama?
And stop trying to blame him.
And why are you so against my going away now? I've been away a lot and I've never noticed it broke your heart.
I'm afraid you're not... very sensitive dear.
You ought to have guessed that... after I knew you knew... about me...
I had to be glad whenever you were away you couldn't see me.
Don't, Mama.
All this talk about... loving me the more I try to tell you how sick I am.
You're so like your father dear.
Love to be dramatic and tragic so you can make a scene out of nothing.
If I gave you the slightest encouragement you'd tell me next you're gonna die.
People do die of it.
Your own father...
Why... why do you mention him?
No comparison at all. With him he had consumption.
I hate it when you become morbid and gloomy.
I forbid you to remind me of my father's death do you hear?
Yes I hear you. I wish to God I didn't.
It's... hard to take at times... having... a dope fiend for a mother.
Forgive me, Mama.
I was angry... and you hurt me.
Just listen to that... foghorn.
And the bells.
Why is it... fog makes everything sound so sad,
...lost?
I wonder.
I can't say.
I don't want any dinner.
I haven't taken enough
I have to go upstairs.
I hope sometime without...
...meaning to or...
...take an overdose.
Could never do it deliberately.
The blessed virgin would never forgive me.
The pad lock is all scratched.
That drunken loafer has tried to pick the lock with a piece of wire the way he's done before but
I fooled him this time.
It's a special pad lock a professional burglar couldn't pick.
Where's Edmund?
He went out.
Perhaps he's gone uptown to find Jamie.
He still had some money left.
I suppose it's burning a hole in his pocket.
He said he didn't want any dinner.
Doesn't seem to have any appetite these days.
But it's just a summer cold.
James!
I'm so frightened! I know he's gonna die.
Don't say that it's not true.
They promised me in six months he'd be cured.
You don't believe that. I can tell when you're acting. It'll be all my fault.
I should never have born him.
It would've been better for his sake.
I couldn't have hurt him then.
He wouldn't have had to know his mother was a dope fiend.
Hush, Mary. For the love of God.
He loves you. He knows it was a curse put upon you without you knowing or willing it.
He's proud you're his mother.
Hush now, here comes
Cathleen, you don't want her to see you crying.
Dinner is served sir.
Dinner is served ma'am.
Come along dear.
Let's have our dinner.
I'm as hungry as a hunter.
I couldn't... possibly eat anything, James.
I think you'll have to excuse me.
My... my hands... pain me dreadfully.
I think the best thing for me is to go to bed... and rest.
Goodnight dear.
Up to take more of that
God damn poison is it?
You'll be like a mad ghost before the night is over.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You say such mean bitter things when you've had too much to drink.
You're as bad as Jamie or Edmund.
Who's that?
- Is it you, Edmund?
- Yes.
Turn that light out before you come in.
Well, I'm glad you've come, lad.
I've been damn lonely.
You're a fine one to run away and leave me to sit alone here all night when you know...
I've told you to turn out that light.
We're not giving a ball.
There's no reason to have the house ablaze with electricity at this time of night burning up money.
"ablaze with electricity", one bulb!
Hell everyone leaves a light on in the front porch until they go to bed.
Ended up busting my knee on the hat-stand.
The light from here shows in the hall. You could see a way well enough if you were sober.
If "I" were sober, I like that.
I don't give a damn what other people do.
If they want to be wasteful fools for the sake of show let them be.
One bulb! God, don't be such a cheapskate!
I've proved to you by figures you can leave the light bulb all night on all night it wouldn't be as much as one drink.
To hell with your figures! The proof is in the bills I have to pay.
Yes, facts don't mean a thing do they?
What you want to believe, that's the only truth.
Shakespeare was an Irish catholic for example.
So he was. The proof was in his plays.
Well, he wasn't and there is no proof of it in his plays except to you.
The Duke of Wellington that was another good Irish catholic. I never said he was a good one, he was a renegade but a catholic just the same.
Well, he wasn't, you just want to believe that nobody but an Irish catholic general could beat Napoleon.
Yes, now I'm not going to argue with you. I asked you to turn out that light in the hall.
I heard you and as far as
I'm concerned it stays on.
None of your damned insolence.
Are you going to obey me or not?
Not!
You want to be a crazy miser, put it out yourself.
Now, listen to me. I put up with a lot from you because from the mad things you've done at times I thought you weren't quite right in your head.
I've excused you and never lifted my hand to you, but there's a straw that breaks the camel's back.
You'll obey me and put out that light or big as you are I'll give you a trashing that will teach you...
I'm sorry, lad.
Forgive me I forgot.
You shouldn't goat me into losing my temper.
Forget it, Papa, I apologize too.
I had no right being nasty about nothing.
I'm a bit souse I guess.
I'll put out the damn light.
No. No. No. Stay where you are.
Let it burn.
We'll have them all on.
Let them burn.
To hell with them. The poor house is the end of the road it might as well be sooner as later.
That's a grand curtain.
You're a wonder, Papa.
That's right, laugh at the poor old man.
The poor old ham.
But the final curtain will be in the poor house just he same. And that's not comedy.
Well, well let's not argue. You'll live to learn the value of a dollar.
You're not like that damned tramp of a brother.
I've given up hope he'll ever get sense.
Where is he, by the way?
How would I know?
I thought you went back uptown to meet him.
No I walked down by the beach. I haven't seen him since this afternoon.
Well, if you shared the money
I gave you like a fool...
Sure I did. He always staked me when he had anything.
Well, it doesn't take a soothsayer to tell he's probably in the whorehouse.
For God's sake, Papa. If you're gonna start that stuff again I'll beat it.
All right. All right. I'll stop. God knows I don't like the subject either.
- Will you join me in a drink?
- Now you're talking!
I'm wrong to treat you, you've had enough already but if you walked all the way to the beach you must be damp and chilled.
I dropped in at the inn on the way out and back.
Not the night I'd pick for a long walk.
I love the fog.
It was what I needed.
You should have more sense than to risk...
To hell with sense!
The fog was where I wanted to be.
Halfway down the path you can't see this house.
You'd never even know it was here.
Everything looked and sounded unreal.
It was like... walking on the bottom of the sea.
As if I'd drowned long ago.
As if I was a ghost, belonging to the fog.
And the fog was the ghost of the sea.
It felt damn peaceful to nothing more than a ghost within a ghost.
Don't look at me as if I'd gone nutty.
Who wants to see life as it is if they can help it?
You've a poet in you but it's a damn morbid one.
Devil take your pessimism!
I'm low spirited enough.
Why can't you remember your Shakespeare? You'll find what you were trying to say in him.
"We are such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded with a sleep"
Fine.
That's beautiful but I wasn't trying to say that.
We are such stuff as manure is made on so let's drink up and forget it, that's more my idea.
Keep such sentiments to yourself. I shouldn't have given you that drink.
It did pack a wallop all right.
On you too. Even if you never missed a performance.
What's wrong with being drunk?
It's what were after, isn't it?
"Be always drunken
Nothing else matters
That is the only question"
"If you would not feel the horrible burden of time weighing on your shoulders and crushing you to the earth"
"Be drunken continually"
"Be drunken with what? With wine, with poetry or virtue as you will"
"But be drunken And if sometimes on the stairs of a palace"
"Or on the green side of a ditch Or in the dreary solitude of your own room"
"You should awaken
And the drunkenness be half of wholly slipped away from you"
"Ask of the wind or of the wave or of the star or of the bird or of the clock Of whatever flies or sighs or rocks or sings or speaks"
"Ask what hour it is
And the wind, the wave, star, bird, clock will answer you"
"It is the hour to be drunken
Be drunken continually"
"With wine, with poetry or with virtue As you will"
Well, I wouldn't worry about the virtue part of it if I were you.
But you recited it well, lad.
- Who wrote it?
- Baudelaire.
Never heard of him.
Where do you get your taste in authors?
This damned library of yours...
Voltaire and Rousseau and
Schopenhauer and Ibsen!
Atheists, fools and madmen! And your poet, this Baudelaire.
And Swinburne and Oscar
Wilde, and Whitman and Poe!
Whore-mongers and degenerates.
I have three good sets of
Shakespeare you could read.
They say he was a souse too.
They lie. I don't doubt he liked his glass, it's a good man's failing, but he knew how to drink that it didn't poison his mind with morbidness and filth.
Don't compare him with the pack you've got here.
Your dirty Zola! And your Dante Gabriel
Rossetti who was a dope fiend...
Perhaps it would be wise to change the subject.
You can't accuse me of not knowing Shakespeare.
Didn't I win five dollars from you once when you bet me I couldn't learn a leading part of his in a week as you used to do in stock in the old days.
I learned Macbeth and recited it letter perfect with you giving me the cues.
That's true, so you did.
And a terrible ordeal it was I remember hearing you murder the lines.
I kept wishing I'd paid over the bet without making you prove it.
Did you hear?
She's moving around.
I hope to God she doesn't come down.
Yes, she'd be nothing more than a ghost haunting the past by this time.
Back before I was born.
Doesn't she do the same with me?
You must take her memories with a grain of salt.
Her wonderful home was ordinary enough.
Her father wasn't the great noble Irish gentleman she makes out. He was a nice enough man, good company a good talker.
I liked him and he liked me.
He was prosperous enough too in his wholesale grocery business.
An able man.
But he had his weakness.
She condemns my drinking but she forgets his.
It's true he never touched a drop until he was forty but after that he made up for lost time.
He became a steady champagne drinker.
The worst kind. That was his grand pose.
To drink only champagne.
Well, it finished him quick.
That and the consumption.
We don't seem to be able to avoid unpleasant topics, do we?
No.
Well, what do you say to a game or two of casino, lad? All right.
We can't lock up and go to bed until
Jamie comes on the last trolly.
Which I hope he won't.
I don't want to go upstairs anyway.
Until she's gone to sleep.
Neither do I.
As I told you before...
...you must take her tales of the past with a grain of salt.
The piano playing and her dream of becoming a concert pianist.
It was put in her head by the nuns flattering her. She was their pet.
They loved her for being so devout
And the idea she might have become a nun, that's the worst.
Your mother was one of the most beautiful girls you ever could see.
She knew it too.
She was a bit of a rogue and a coquette, God bless her, behind all her shyness and blushes.
She was never made to renounce the world.
She was bursting with health and high spirits and the love of loving.
For God's sake, Papa, pick up your hand.
Yes. Yes.
Let's see what I have here.
Listen.
She's coming downstairs.
Let's play our game, pretend not to notice.
She'll soon go up again.
I don't see her, she must have started down... and turned back.
- Thank God!
Yes.
It's pretty horrible to see her the way she must be now.
She's been terribly frightened about your illness for all her pretending.
Don't be too hard on her, lad.
Remember she's not responsible.
I know damn well she's not to blame.
And I know who is. You are.
Your damned stinginess.
If you'd spent money on a decent doctor when she was so sick after I was born she would never known morphine existed.
You must try to see my side of it too, lad.
How was I to know he was that kind of doctor?
He'd a good reputation.
Among the souses in the hotel bar I suppose.
You lie! I asked the hotel proprietor to recommend the best...
And at the same time crying "poor house" and making it plain you wanted a cheap one.
I know your system.
God I ought to after this afternoon.
What about this afternoon?
Never mind now. We're talking about Mama.
I'm saying no matter how you try and excuse yourself, you know damn well your stinginess was to blame.
I say you're a liar, shut your mouth right now or...
After you'd found out she was a morphine addict why didn't you send her to a cure then, at the start, when she still had a chance?
What did I know about morphine?
It was years before I discovered what was wrong.
Why didn't I send her to a cure you say? I've spent thousands on thousands in cures, a waste!
What have they done her?
She's always started again.
Yes, it's because you've never given her anything that would help her want to stay off it.
No home except this summer dump in a place she hates and you've refused to spend money even to make this look decent.
While you keep buying more property and playing sucker for every con-man with a gold mine or a silver mine or any other get rich quick swindle.
You've dragged her around the road, season after season, on one night stands with no one she could talk to.
Waiting night after night in dirty hotel rooms for you to come home with a bun on after the bar has closed.
It isn't any wonder she didn't want to be cured.
God. God! When I think of it I hate your guts.
Edmund how dare you talk to your father like that?
You insolent young cub!
After all I've done for you.
We'll come to that, what you're doing for me.
Will you stop repeating your mother's crazy accusations?
I've never dragged her on the road against her will.
Naturally I wanted her with me, I loved her.
And she came because she loved me and wanted to be with me that's the truth.
She needn't have been lonely, she had her children and I insisted despite the expense on having a nurse to travel with her.
Yes, your one generosity.
And that because you were jealous of her spending too much time with us.
And wanted us out of your way. And that was another mistake too. If she had to take care of me all by herself and had that to occupy her mind maybe she'd been able to stop.
Or for that matter since you insist on judging things by what she says when she's not in her right mind, if you'd never been born she'd never...
Sure.
I know that's how she feels, Papa.
She doesn't.
She loves you as dearly as ever a mother loved a son.
I've only said that because you've put me in such a God damned rage.
Making up the past, saying you hate me.
I didn't mean it, Papa.
I'm like Mama. I can't help liking you in spite of everything.
Well, I might say the same of you.
You're no great shakes as a son.
It's a case of "A poor thing but mine own".
Well, what's happened to our game?
Who's play is it?
Yours, I guess.
You mustn't let yourself get too downhearted, lad, by the bad news you had today.
Both doctors promised me, if you obey orders, at this place you're going, you'll be cured in six months or a year at most.
Don't kid me... you think I'm gonna die.
That's a lie! You're crazy!
So why waste money? That's why you're sending me to a state farm.
What state farm? It's the Hill Town
Sanatorium, that's all I know.
Both doctors told me it's the best place for you.
For the money. Or for nothing or practically nothing.
Don't lie, Papa. You know damn well Hill
Town Sanatorium is a state institution.
Jamie suspected you'd cry "poor house" to Hardy and wormed the truth out of him.
That drunken loafer! I'll kick him out in the gutter!
He's poisoned your mind against me ever since you were old enough to listen.
You can't deny it's true about the state farm, can you?
It's not true the way you look at it.
What if it is run by the state, that's nothing against it.
The state has money to make a better place than any private sanatorium.
And why shouldn't I take advantage of it?
It's my right and yours, we're residents, I'm a property owner.
I help to support it.
I'm taxed to death...
Yes, on property valued at a quarter of a million.
Lies. That's all mortgaged.
Hardy and the specialist know what you're worth.
All I told them was I was no millionaire that could afford such a sanatorium because I was land poor.
That's the truth.
Then you went to the club and you met McGuire and "you let him stick you with another bum piece of property".
- It's not true.
- Don't worry about it.
We met McGuire in the hotel bar after you left.
Jamie kidded him about hooking you and he winked and laughed.
- You liar.
- No lie about it!
God, Papa!
Ever since I went to see him was on my own and found out what it felt like to be broke and starved.
And I tried to be fair to you because I knew what you'd
Well...
Who's play is it?
"A stinking old miser"
Well, maybe you're right.
Maybe I can't help being....
Although all my life, since
I had anything, I've thrown money over the bar to buy drinks for everyone in the house or loaned money to sponges that I knew would never pay back. But of course that was in bar-rooms when I was full of whiskey.
Can't feel that way about it when I'm sober in my home.
It was at home I first learned the value of a dollar and the fear of the poor house.
I've never been able to believe in my luck since.
You said you realize what I'd been up against as a boy.
The hell you do. How could you?
You had everything. Nurses, schools...
I know you've had a spell of hard work with your back and hands and a bit of being homeless and penniless in a foreign land and I respect you for it. But it was a game of romance and adventure to you.
- It was play.
- Yes, particularly the time I tried to commit suicide at Jimmy the Priest's and almost did.
You weren't in your right mind.
No son of mine would ever...
- You were drunk.
- I was stone cold sober. That was the trouble. I stopped to think too long.
Don't start your damned atheist morbidness again.
I don't care to listen.
I was trying to make plain to you.
What do you know of the value of a dollar?
When I was ten... my father deserted my mother and went back to Ireland to die.
Which he did, soon enough and deserved to and I hope he's roasting in hell.
He mistook rat poison for flour or sugar or something...
There was gossip it wasn't by mistake but that's a lie.
No one in my family would ever...
My bet is it wasn't by mistake.
More morbidness. Your brother put that in your head.
The worst he can suspect is the only truth for him.
But never mind.
My mother was left... a stranger in a strange land with four small children. There was no damned romance in our poverty.
Twice we were evicted from the miserable hovel we called home.
My mother's few sticks of furniture thrown out on the gutter.
My mother and sisters crying.
I cried too, though I tried hard not to.
But I was the man of the family at ten years old.
There was no more school for me.
I went to work twelve hours a day in a machine shop.
Learning to make files.
Dirty barn of a place where rain dripped through the roof.
You roasted in the summer, there was no stove in winter. Your hands were numb with cold. The only light came through two small filthy windows.
So on gray days I'd have to sit bent over, my eyes almost touching the files in order to see.
You talk of work.
What do you think I got for it?
Fifty cents a week.
It's the truth. Fifty cents a week.
My poor mother washed and scrubbed for the yanks.
Well, I remember one thanksgiving... or maybe it was Christmas some yank in whose house mother had been scrubbing gave her a dollar extra for a present. On the way home she spent it all on food.
I remember her hugging and kissing us and saying, tears of joy running down her tired face,
"glory be to God! For once in our lives there will be enough for each of us."
Fine brave sweet woman!
Never was a finer or a braver!
Yes, she must have been.
It was in those days I learned to be a miser.
A dollar was worth so much then.
Once you've learned the lesson it's hard to unlearn it.
You have to look for bargains.
If I took this state farm for a good bargain you'll have to forgive me. The doctors did tell me it was a good place, you must believe that, Edmund.
But I swear I never meant for you to go there if you didn't want to.
You can go to any place you choose, never mind what it costs.
Any place... I can afford.
Any place... within reason.
What about our game?
Whose play is it?
I don't know.
Mine I guess.
No it's yours.
Yes.
Maybe life overdid the lesson for me and made a dollar worth too much.
And that mistake ruined my career as a fine actor.
I've never admitted this to anyone before, lad.
But tonight I'm so heartsick, I feel at the end of everything.
And what's the use of fake pride and pretense?
That God damned play I bought for a song and made such a great success in, a great money success, it ruined me with it's promise of an easy fortune.
I didn't want to do anything else.
By the time I woke up to the fact I'd become a slave to the damn thing and did try other plays it was too late.
They'd identified me with that one part and didn't want me in anything else.
They were right too.
I'd lost the great talent I once had through years of easy repetition, never learning a new part never really working hard.
Thirty-five to forty thousand dollars net profit a season!
Like snapping your fingers.
Yet before I bought the damn thing
I was considered one of the three or four young actors with the greatest artistic promise in America.
I'd work like hell!
I left a good job as a machinist to take supers' parts because I loved the theater.
I was wild with ambition.
I read all the plays ever written.
I studied
Shakespeare as you'd study the Bible.
I got rid of an Irish brogue(accent) you could cut with a knife. I loved Shakespeare. I'd have acted in any of his plays for nothing
For the joy of being alive in his great poetry.
I could have been a great
Shakespearean actor if I'd kept on.
In 1874 when Edwin Booth came to the theater in Chicago where I was leading man.
I played Cassius to his
Brutus one night, Brutus to his Cassius the next. Othello to his Iago and so on.
First night I played Othello he said to our manager: "That young man is playing Othello better than I ever did."
That from Booth!
The greatest actor of his day or any other.
As I look back on it now, that night was the highest spot of my career.
I had life where I wanted it.
But for a time after that I kept on with ambition high, married your mother. Ask her what I was like in those days.
Her love was an added incentive to ambition.
Then a few years later my good bad luck made me find the big money maker.
And then life had me where it wanted me.
At from thirty-five to forty thousand net profit a season.
A fortune in those days.
Even in these.
What the hell was it I wanted to buy, I wonder, that was worth...
Oh well, it's a late day for regrets.
My play, isn't it?
I'm glad you told me this, Papa.
I know you a lot better now.
Maybe I shouldn't have told you.
Maybe you'll only feel more contempt for me.
It's a poor way to convince you of the value of a dollar.
The glare from those extra lights hurts my eyes.
You don't mind if I turn them out do you?
We don't need them.
There's no point in making the electric company light company rich.
No, sure not. Turn them out.
No, I don't know what the hell it was I wanted to buy.
On my solemn oath, Edmund.
I'd gladly face not having an acre of land to call my own, nor a penny in the bank
I'd be willing to have no home but the poor house in my old age if I could look back now on having been the fine artist I might have been.
What the devil are you laughing at?
Not at you, Papa.
At life, it's so damned crazy.
More of your morbidness. There's nothing wrong with life.
It's we who...
"The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings"
The praise Edwin Booth gave my Othello!
I made our manager write down his exact words in writing.
I kept it in my wallet for years. I used to read it every once in a while.
Until, finally, it made me feel so bad I couldn't face it anymore.
Where is it now, I wonder?
Somewhere in this house.
I remember I put it away carefully.
Might be in an old trunk in the attic along with Mama's wedding dress.
For Pete's sake, Papa, if we're gonna play cards, let's play.
She's still moving around.
- God know when she'll go to sleep!
- For God's sake, Papa, forget it!
You just told me some high spots in your memories, want to hear mine?
They're all connected with the sea.
Here's one. When I was on the Squarehead square rigger, bound for Buenos Aires.
Full moon in the Trades the old hooker driving fourteen knots.
I lay on the bowsprit, facing astern the water foaming into spume under me, the masts with every sail white in the moonlight, towering high above me.
I became drunk with the beauty and singing rhythm of it, and for a moment
I lost myself -- actually lost my life.
I was set free!
I dissolved in the sea, became white sails and flying spray, became beauty and rhythm, became the ship and the moonlight and the high dim-starred sky!
I belonged, without past or future, within peace and unity and a wild joy, to something greater than my own life, or the life of Man, to Life itself!
To God, if you want to put it that way.
And several other times in my life, when I was swimming far out, or lying alone on a beach,
I have had the same experience.
Became the sun, the hot sand, green seaweed anchored to a rock, swaying in the tide.
Like a saint's vision of beatitude.
Like the veil of things as they seem drawn back by an unseen hand.
For a second you see -- and seeing the secret are the secret.
For a second there is meaning!
Then the hand lets the veil fall and you are alone, lost in the fog again.
It's a great mistake me being born a man. I'd have been much more successful as a seagull or a fish.
As it is I'll always be a stranger who can never really feel at home.
Who does not really want, is not really wanted who can never really belong and who must always be a little in love with death.
Yes, you've the makings of a poet in you all right.
The makings of a poet?
No I'm... I'm afraid
I'm like the guy who's always panhandling for a smoke.
He hasn't even got the makings, he's only got the habit.
I couldn't touch what I was trying to tell you just now
I only stammered.
It's the best I'll ever do, I mean if I live.
That's faithful realism at least.
Stammering is the native eloquence of us, fog people.
Well, that sounds like absent brother.
He must have a peach of a bun on.
That loafer. He caught the last car back.
Bad luck to it.
Get him to bed, Edmund. I'll go out on the porch. He has a tongue like an adder when he's drunk.
I'd only lose my temper.
What ho! What...
Nix on the loud noise.
Hello kid.
I'm as drunk as a fiddler's bitch.
Thanks for telling me your great secret.
Yeah. Unnecessary information number one.
I had a serious accident. Front steps tried to trample on me.
Took advantage of the fog the way...
Ought to be another lighthouse out there.
It's dark in here too.
What the hell is this, the morgue?
"Ford, ford, ford o' Kabul river in the dark!"
"Keep the crossing-stakes beside you, an' they will surely guide you 'Cross the ford o'
Kabul river in the dark."
There. That's more like it.
To hell with old Gaspard!
Where is that old tight wad?
He's out on the porch.
He expects us to live.... in a black hole in Calcutta!
Say...
Have I got the DTs? (delirium tremens; from alcohol withdrawal)
My God!
It's real.
Hey what's the matter with the old man? He must be acidified to forget he left this out.
Grab opportunity by the forelock!
It's the key to my success.
You're stinking now.
That will knock you stiff.
Wisdom from the mouth of babes.
Can the wise stuff kid, you're still wet behind the ears.
All right. Pass out if you want to.
I can't, that's the trouble.
I've had enough to sink a ship but I can't sink.
- Well... here's hoping.
- I'll have one too.
No. No you don't. Not while I'm around.
Remember doctors orders.
Maybe no one else gives a damn if you die but I do.
You're my kid brother.
I love your guts kid.
Everything else is gone and you're all I got left.
So no booze for you if I can help it.
Lay off.
You don't believe I care.
Just drunken bull.
All right go ahead and kill yourself.
Sure I know you care, Jamie.
And I'm going on the wagon but tonight doesn't count.
Too many damned things have happened today. Here's how.
I know kid, it's been a lousy day for you.
I bet old Gaspard hasn't tried to keep you off the booze. He'll probably give you a case to take with you to the state farm for pauper patients.
The sooner you kick the bucket, the less expense.
What a bastard to have for a father!
God if you put him in a book no one would believe it.
Papa's all right if you try to understand him and keep your sense of humor.
He's been putting on the old sob act for you?
He could always fool you but not me.
Never again.
Though I do feel sorry for him in a way about one thing.
He even had that coming to him.
He's to blame.
To hell with that.
The last drink is really getting to me, this one ought to put the lights out.
Hey did you tell old Gaspard that I got it out of doc.
Hardy that the sanatorium was a charity dump?
Yes. I told him I wouldn't go there.
It's all settled now, he said I can go anywhere I want... within reason of course.
Yes, "of course my boy, a-ny-thing... within reason".
That means another cheap dump!
Old Gaspard, the miser in "The Bells".
That's a part he can play without make-up.
I've heard that Gaspard stuff a million times.
All right, if you're satisfied, let him get away with it.
It's your funeral.
I mean...
I hope it won't be.
What did you do uptown tonight?
Go to Mamie Burns?
Sure thing. Where else could I find suitable feminine companionship?
And love?
Don't forget love.
What is man without a good woman to love?
- A God damn hollow hole.
- You're a nut.
Hey... guess which one of Mamie's charmers I picked to bless me with her woman's love.
It'll hand you a laugh kid.
I picked...
Fat Violet.
- No, honest?
- Yeah.
Some pick!
God! Oh God she weighs a ton.
- What the hell for, a joke?
- Oh no, no joke.
Very serious. By the time I hit
Mamie's dump I was feeling very sorry for myself and all the other poor bums in the world.
Ready for a weep on any old womanly bosom.
You know how you get when the old John barley corn turns on the soft music inside of you.
And the as soon as I hit the door, Mamie began telling me her troubles. She beefed how rotten business was. She was going to give Fat Violet the gate.
The customers didn't fall for Vi, the only reason she kept her was she could play the piano.
Well, lately Violet has been going on drunks and been getting to boiled to play and was eating her out of house and home.
How old Vi was a good hearted dumbbell and I felt sorry for her
'cause she didn't know how in the hell she'd make a living.
Still... business was business.
She couldn't afford to run a home for fat tarts.
Well, it made me... feel very sorry for Fat Violet.
So I squandered two bucks of your dough to escort her upstairs.
Now, with no dishonorable intentions whatever.
I like them fat but not that fat.
All I wanted was a little heart to heart talk concerning the infinite sorrow of life.
Poor Vi!
She stood it for a while, then she got good and sore.
Got the idea I'd taken her upstairs as a joke.
Gave me a grand bawling out.
Then she began to cry.
So I had to say I loved her, because she was fat.
And she wanted to believe that.
Then I stayed with her to prove it.
And that cheered her up.
She kissed me when I left.
Said she'd fallen hard for me.
And we both cried a little more in the hallway and everything was fine.
Except Mamie Burns thought
I'd gone bughouse.
Harlots and hunted have pleasures of their own to give, the vulgar herd can never understand.
Exactly!
And a hell of a good time at that.
This night has opened mine eyes to a great career in store for me my boy.
I shall give the art of acting back to the performing seals, which are it's most perfect expression, by applying my natural God given talents in their proper sphere.
I shall attain the pinnacle of success!
I'll be the lover of the fat woman in Barnum and Bailey Circus.
Imagine me sunk to the fat girl in a hick town hooker shop. Me!
I've had some of the best lookers on Broadway sit up and beg.
"Speakin' in general,
I've tried 'em all, the
'appy roads that take you o'er the world."
It's not so apt.
Happy roads is bunk.
Weary roads is right.
They get you nowhere fast.
And that's where I got... nowhere.
Where everyone lands in the end, even if most of the suckers won't admit it.
Can it, you'll be crying in a minute.
Hey!
Don't get too damn fresh.
But you're right, the hell with repining.
Fat Violet is a good kid.
I'm glad I stayed with her.
It was a Christian act.
Cured her blues, a hell of a good time.
You should have stuck around with me kid.
Taken your mind off your troubles.
What's the use of coming home?
You get the blues over what can't be helped.
It's all over.
Finished, now.
Not a hope.
"If I were hanged on the highest hill,
Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
I know whose love would follow me still..."
Shut up!
Where's the hop head?
Gone to sleep?
You dirty bastard!
Thanks kid.
I certainly had that coming.
I don't know what made me.
- Booze talking, you know me kid.
- God! Jamie.
No matter how drunk you are, there's no excuse.
I'm sorry I...
You and I never scrapped that bad.
Sorry kid. Glad you did.
My dirty tongue, I'd like to cut it out.
It was because I feel so damn sunk.
Because this time
Mama had me fooled.
I suppose I can't forgive her yet.
It meant so much...
I'd began to hope that if she'd beaten the game... maybe I could too.
God don't I know how you feel.
Oh God!
I've known about Mama so much longer than you.
I'll never forget the first time I got wise.
I caught her in the act with a hypo.
God!
I'd never believe before that anyone but whores took dope.
Stop it, Jamie.
And then this stuff of your getting consumption.
It's... it's got me licked.
We've been more than brothers.
You're the only pal I ever had.
I love your guts kid, I'd do anything for you.
I know that, Jamie.
Yeah.
I bet you heard Mama and old Gaspard spilling so much bunk about my hoping for the worst you suspect right now I'm thinking to myself that
Papa is old, can't last much longer and if you were to die, Mama and I would get all he's got.
- So I'm probably hoping...
- Shut up you damn fool!
What the hell put that in your nut?
That's what I'd like to know.
What put that in your mind?
Don't be a dumbbell!
What I said.
I'm always suspected of hoping for the worst.
I got so I can't help it.
Hey!
What are you trying to do?
Accuse me? Now don't you play the wise guy with me!
I've learned more about life than you'll ever know. Just because you read a lot of high brow junk don't think you can fool me.
You're only an overgrown kid.
Mama's baby,
Papa's pet, the family white hope.
The...
You've been getting a swelled head lately about nothing!
About a few poems in a hick town newspaper.
Hell, I used to write better stuff for the lit. magazine in college.
You better wake up!
You're setting no rivers on fire.
You let hick town boobs flatter you with bunk about your future...
Hell kid... forget that.
That goes for Sweeney. You know I didn't mean it.
No one is prouder that you started to make good.
Why shouldn't I be proud?
You reflect credit on me.
I had more to do with bringing you up than anybody.
I wised you up about women so you'd never be the fall guy and make any mistakes you didn't want to make.
And who steered you on to reading that poetry first?
Swinburne, for example?
I did!
And because I once wanted to write, I put it in your head that someday you'd write.
Hell you're more than my brother.
I made you!
You are my Frankenstein!
All right.
I'm your Frankenstein.
So... let's have another drink?
You crazy nut.
No.
I'll have a drink... not you.
I got to take care of you.
Listen kid... you'll be going away
I may not get another chance to talk or I may not be drunk enough to tell you the truth so I got to tell you now something I ought to have told you a long time ago for your own good.
No drunken bull.
But in vino veritas.
You better take this seriously.
I wanna warn you... against me.
Mama and Papa are right I've been a rotten bad influence but worst of all is...
I did it on purpose.
I don't want to hear anymore.
You listen...
I did it on purpose to make a bum out of you.
Part of me did a big part.
The part that's been dead so long that hates life.
My putting you wise so you'd learn from my mistakes well I believed that myself at times but it's a fake. It made my mistakes look good.
Made getting drunk romantic.
Made whores fascinating vampires instead of poor stupid diseased slobs they really are.
Made fun of work as a sucker's game.
I never wanted you to succeed and make me look even worse by comparison.
Wanted you to fail.
Always jealous of ya.
Mama's baby! Papa's pet!
And it was your being born that started Mama on dope. I know that's not your fault but all the same God damn you!
I can't help hating your guts.
- Cut it out, Jamie.
- Don't get me wrong kid.
I love you more than I hate you.
My telling what I'm telling you now proves it.
Because I run the risk you'll hate me and you're all I got left.
I didn't mean to tell you all that last stuff to go that far back, I don't know what made me.
What I wanted to say is I'd like to see you become the greatest success in the world.
But you better be on your guard, because
I'm gonna do my damnest to make you fail.
I can't help it.
I hate myself. I got to take revenge on everyone else, especially you.
The dead part of me hopes you won't get well.
Maybe he's even glad the game's got Mama again.
He wants company!
He doesn't want to be the only corpse around the house.
God, Jamie!
You're crazy!
You think it over, you'll see I'm right.
Think it over while you're away from me in the sanatorium. Make up your mind you gotta tie a can to me, get me out of your life.
You got to think of me as dead.
Tell people "I had a brother but he's dead".
And you come back you look out for me because I'll be waiting to welcome you here with that "My old pal" stuff and give you the glad hand and the first good chance I get I'm gonna stab you in the back!
Stop! I'll be god damned if I'm gonna listen to...
Don't you forget me. Remember
I warned you for your sake.
Come on! Give me credit!
"Greater love hath no man than this: That he saveth his brother from himself."
That's all.
I'm finished now... I've gone to confession.
I know you absolve me, don't you kid?
You understand.
You're a damn fine kid.
You ought to be.
I made you.
So go and get well.
Don't die on me, you're all I got left.
God bless, kid.
That last drink... the old K.O.
Thank God he's asleep.
I thought he'd never stop talking.
You better let him sleep, what he needs is to sleep it off.
I heard the last part of his talk, it's what warned you. I hope you'll heed the warning now that it comes from his own mouth.
You mustn't take it too much to heart though, lad.
He loves to exaggerate the worst in himself when he's drunk.
He's devoted to you.
It's the one good thing left in him.
What a sweet spectacle for me my first born who I'd hoped would bear my name in honor and dignity.
Showed such brilliant promise.
- Be quiet can't you, Papa?
- A waste! A wreck! A drunken hulk!
Done with and finished.
"Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured
Clarence, That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on him, Furies and take him in to torment."
What the hell are you staring at?
"Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been.
I am also called No-more,
Too-late, Farewell."
I'm well aware of that and God knows I don't want to look at it.
Quit it!
You know I got a great idea for you, Papa.
Pu on a revival of "The
Bells" this season, there's a great part in there you can play without make-up.
- Old Gaspard the miser!
- Shut up, Jamie!
I claim that Edwin Booth never saw the day when he could give as good a performance as a trained seal.
Seals are intelligent and honest, they don't put on any bluffs about "the art of acting", they admit they're just hams earning their daily fish.
You loafer!
Papa! You wanna start a row that'll bring Mama down?
Jamie go to sleep.
You shot off your mouth too much already.
All right kid.
I'm not looking for an argument.
Too damn sick.
I wish to God she'd go to bed so that I could too.
I'm dumb tired.
I can't stay up all night like I used to.
I'm getting old.
Old and finished.
I can't keep my eyes open.
I think I'll catch a few winks.
Why don't you do the same, Edmund.
It'll pass the time until she...
"A mad scene."
"Enter Ophelia"
Good boy, Edmund! The dirty blaggard!
His own mother!
All right kid I had that coming but I told you how much I'd hoped.
I'll kick you out in the gutter tomorrow, so help me God!
Papa.
Jamie.
For the love of God! Stop it.
I play so badly now. I'm all out of practice.
Sister Theresa would give me a dreadful scolding.
She'd tell me it isn't fair to my father who spent so much money for extra lessons.
She's quite right it isn't fair when he's so good and generous and so proud of me.
I'll practice everyday from now on.
Something... horrible has happened to my hands.
The fingers have gotten all stiff, the knuckles are all swollen, they're so ugly.
I'll go to the infirmary and show sister Martha. She's old and a little cranky, but I love her just the same.
She has things in her medicine chest that'll cure anything. She'll give me something to rub on my hands and tell me to pray to the blessed virgin.
I'll be well again in no time.
Let... let me see...
What did I... come here... to find?
It's terrible how absent minded I've become.
Always dreaming and forgetting.
Here, let me take it dear.
You'll only step on it and then you'll be sorry afterwards.
Thank you. You're very kind.
It's a wedding gown, it's very lovely, isn't it?
I remember now...
I found it... in the attic hidden in a trunk.
I... I don't know what I wanted it for.
I'm going to be a nun.
That is... if I can only... find...
What is it I'm looking for?
- I know it's something I lost.
- Mary.
No good, Papa.
Something I... I miss... terribly.
It... it can't be all together lost.
Mama.
- Something... - What's the use...?
- ...I need terribly.
I remember, when I had it I was never lonely nor afraid.
I can't have lost it forever.
I'd die if I thought that.
Because then th... there would be no hope.
Mama.
It's not just a summer cold.
I've got consumption.
No. No!
You must not try to hold me.
You must not try to touch me.
You damn fool, it's no good.
It's not right when
I'm hoping to be a nun.
We are fools to pay any attention.
It's the damn poison! I never knew her drown herself in it as deep as this before.
Pass me that bottle, Jamie.
I had a talk with mother Elizabeth.
She's so sweet and good.
A saint on earth.
I love her dearly.
It may be sinful of me, but I love her better than my own mother.
Because she always understands even before you say a word.
Her kind blue eyes look right into your heart.
Can't keep any secrets from her.
You couldn't deceive even if you were mean enough to want to.
All the same...
I... I don't think she was so understanding this time.
I told her I wanted to be a nun.
I explained how sure
I was of my vocation, that I'd prayed to the blessed virgin to make me sure and find me worthy.
I told mother I had had a true vision when I was praying in the shrine of our Lady of Lords, on the little island in the lake.
I said I knew as surely as I was kneeling there that the blessed virgin had smiled and given me her consent but mother Elizabeth said
I must be more sure than that even, that I must prove it wasn't simply my imagination.
She said if I was so sure then I wouldn't mind putting myself to a test by going home after I'd graduated and living as other girls live, going out to parties and dances and enjoy myself and then after a year or two if I was still sure I could come back to see her and we would talk it over again.
I never dreamed holy mother would give me such advice.
I was really shocked!
I said naturally I...
I would do anything she suggested, but I knew it was simply a waste of time.
After... I left her I felt... all mixed up.
So I went to the shrine and I prayed to the blessed virgin and found peace again.
Because I knew she heard my prayer and would always love me and see no harm ever came to me so long... so long as I never lost my faith in her.
That was in the winter of... senior year.
Then in the spring something happened to me.
Yes I remember.
I fell in love with James Tyrone and was so happy... for a time.
Tell what, boy?
Three times I had seen how they threw the ball with all their strength in his face, at his legs, in his loins.
Nettlinger had risked our chances of victory merely so that one of the opponents would have the opportunity of hitting Schrella with the ball.
And Vacano, our own sportsmaster, whom those from the Prince Otto School had accepted as referee, must have been in league with them.
Why, why did they do that to Schrella, put out a leg as he came down the steps during break, fall upon him on the way home, drag him into doorways, beat him up between dustbins and abandoned prams, push him down dark cellar steps.
Only a few didn't join in:
Enders, Drischka, Schweugel,
Grewe and Holten.
- Are you Jewish?
- No.
What are you then?
We are lambs, and have sworn never to eat of the Buffalo Sacrament.
Lambs?
I must know exactly.
I'll show you, come on.
They do it down in the old barracks near the Wilhelmskuhle.
Vacano and Nettlinger.
They call it auxiliary police.
They seized me during a raid on beggars in the harbour district.
Thirty-eight beggars arrested in one day.
I was one of them.
We were interrogated with the barbed whip.
They said:
"Admit you're a beggar, then. "
And I said:
"Yes, I am one. "
Fetch me a cognac, please.
A cognac for the gentleman upstairs.
How shall we redeem the world?
Through sheep's wool, sheep's leather, sheep's milk
... and through knitting.
Wherein lies the world's salvation hidden?
In sheep.
Why won't you be the Holy Lamb in my new religion, you silly boy?
I would make you great, rich, and they would kneel before you in even smarter hotel halls.
Go away, you're too silly.
At least 17 women, old and young, are searching for you.
Clear off quick, here comes another.
Love, my boy...
I've never known what it is.
They'd have poisoned me if they'd only summoned up the courage.
They called me
"such a thing shouldn't be born".
Is there any more to the story?
Do you want to hear it?
Ferdinand Progulske, apprentice, born on 1st May 1917 in Cologne,
was beheaded today at 7.30 a. m.
The Minister-President has rejected the appeal for a reprieve,
since this was an ambuscade
organised by the communist underworld.
He had slipped into
Vacano's apartment, had thrown the bomb at his feet.
Vacano only had burns on his feet.
You're still coming to the
Cafe Zons, as arranged?
Are you coming, or aren't you?
I had done it.
I'd gone with Schrella to the little
Cafe Zons in Boisseree Street, where the lambs met, and I had sworn to a young girl called Edith, sworn to her face, never to taste of the Buffalo Sacrament.
And then held a speech in the dark back room, with dark words which didn't sound like lamb, but like blood, like rebellion and revenge.
Nettlinger was waiting for me outside, and they took me to the Wilhelmskuhle.
Nettlinger lashed out.
And he came into my cell at daybreak, and said:
"Clear out. Run away.
"But I can only give you an hour's start.
"In one hour I shall have to report it to the police. "
I ran right round the city to the harbour.
Hey, sonny, that road leads nowhere.
- To your house.
- Come down here.
Oh, you're... I know who you are, but I've forgotten your name.
Fähmel.
Of course, they're after you.
It came this morning with the early news.
So you have to go flinging bombs about!
You have to plot together...
Yesterday I already packed one of you up and sent him across the border.
Yesterday, whom?
Schrella, he hid himself here, and I had to force him to leave on the "Anna Katharina".
What on earth is it, what's wrong with you?
- More milk, boy?
- No, thanks.
Don't worry, Alois will come the day after tomorrow.
Monday or Tuesday you'll be in Rotterdam.
They'll kill you.
Don't forget us, sonny.
- What can I do for you, Mr...?
- Nettlinger.
I must speak to Dr Fähmel.
Urgently. At once. Officially.
Available only for my mother, my father, my daughter,
my son... and for Mr Schrella.
Nobody else.
I know he's here.
I want to see the manager.
Left round here, then second door on the right... Management.
I wish to be announced.
The manager, please.
Porter speaking.
Sir, a Mr...
What was the name?
Mr, sorry, Dr Nettlinger, wishes to speak to you urgently.
Yes, thank you.
The manager is expecting you.
- Did you take part in the war?
- Yes.
What did you do?
I was a demolition expert.
Does that mean anything to you?
I have seen them blowing up rocks in the quarry behind Denklingen.
That's exactly what I did, only I didn't blow up rocks.
I blew up bridges and apartment blocks, churches and railway viaducts, villas and crossroads.
And at the end of the war
I was attached to a general who had only one word in his head:
"field-of-fire".
Do you know what
"field-of-fire" is?
Look, if I wanted to fire now at the bridge which is behind St Severin, the church would be in the field-of-fire, too, so St Severin would also have to be blown up so I could fire at the bridge, and I would blow St Severin sky high.
I had a good team with me, physicists and architects, and we blew up whatever stood in our way.
The last one was
St Anthony's Abbey, which had been built by my father.
It lay right between two armies, one German and one American.
I provided the German army with its field-of-fire, which it didn't need at all.
The manager asks if you will receive a Dr Nettlinger.
- Would you receive someone called Nettlinger? - No.
Schoolfellow of Robert's?
Ministerial councillor, director, manager?
And you sent him to the
Prince Heinrich Hotel!
He doesn't like it, my son Robert, when people disturb him.
But, my child, he won't do anything to you on that account!
Come...
Let's go and eat...
...and celebrate my birthday a little.
Municipal Prison
Where would you like to be taken to?
The station.
Are you thinking of leaving this hospitable city already?
No, I'm not thinking of leaving this hospitable city yet.
It was a damned accident your name was still on the wanted list.
Attempted murder becomes superannuated after 20 years.
Attempted murder?
Yes, what you tried against Vacano then comes under that heading.
You probably don't know I had absolutely no part in it.
I never once gave the affair my approval.
Well, so much the better.
All I could do was vouch for you, and arrange for your provisional release.
Now the rest will be merely a formality.
Are you actually still a German citizen?
No, I'm stateless.
Pity! If you could manage to prove you had to flee not for criminal but political reasons, you could get a tidy amount of compensation.
Tell me if you need money.
You won't get far with what you've got.
Thanks, I don't need anything.
May I at least invite you to eat?
Fine, let's go and eat.
Chicken.
I'll take the entrecote.
And smoked salmon?
No, thanks.
I'll have it.
You're missing something really delicious.
To drink?
- I'll have Beaujolais.
- Beer.
Ruthless political hatred between schoolfellows, persecution, interrogation, hatred, drawing blood...
But 20 years later it is, of all people, the atrocious persecutor who rescues the returning refugee from jail.
I'd be sorry if you thought I doubted the sincerity of your motives and feelings.
I don't even doubt your remorse.
But the roles you played then and play today are the same.
Perhaps you don't know what
I did for your sister.
You protected Edith?
Yes. Vacano wanted to have her arrested.
He put her on the list again and again, and again and again
I struck her name off.
Your good deeds are almost more frightful than your misdeeds.
And you are more merciless than God.
We are not God, and can lay no more claim to His mercy than to His omniscience.
Are you by any chance going to let that marvellous salmon go back?
Of course.
But you can't!
Listen to what the son of a waiter has to tell you:
A really fine man never submits to the tyranny of waiters.
By the way, is Vacano still alive?
Of course, he's only fifty-eight, and... he's one of the incorrigible ones.
And you?
If you could only understand me.
I'm a democrat... a democrat by conviction.
- What became of Trischler?
- Trischler?
Old Trischler who lived in the lower harbour.
Don't you remember Alois either, who was in our class?
Oh, now I remember.
We searched for Alois for weeks without finding him, and Vacano himself interrogated Old Trischler, but he got nothing out of him, nothing at all, nor out of the woman.
The district down there was often bombed.
Good God, what's the matter, what are you going to do?
Would you please have this wrapped for me so that the fat doesn't leak out?
- Certainly. The potatoes too, sir?
- No, thank you.
Would you rather I killed you?
I can't stand it any longer.
The fat won't leak out, it's all wrapped in cellophane.
Thank you.
How many breakfasts in the
Cafe Kroner?
Ten thousand, twenty thousand?
I never added them up.
Good morning, sir.
Breakfast?
Yes, please.
A small pot of coffee, but with three cups of coffee.
Toast, two slices of black bread, butter, marmalade, a boiled egg, and paprika-cheese.
Paprika-cheese?
Yes, cream-cheese mixed with paprika.
Very good.
And listen, waiter, I shall have breakfast here tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the day after that...
...in three weeks, three months and three years, you hear?
And always at the same time, around nine.
Very good.
I had rented a room and studio for half a year, paid in advance.
There were three ahead of me.
Every child knew their names:
Brehmockel, Grumpeter, Wollersein.
"Final deadline for
St Anthony project today.
"Have our young architects no spirit?"
...said the newspaper.
I should like to hand over a design to the notary.
St Anthony Open Competition.
The reputation of having been beaten only by
Brehmockel, Grumpeter and Wollersein would have been enough for me.
But the abbot liked my plan.
Will you hold out?
Yes, I'll hold out,
Reverend Father.
Him, gentlemen?
Nothing but work.
Eight o'clock in the morning goes to Low Mass in St Severin.
Breakfast in the Cafe Kroner till ten-thirty.
From ten-thirty till five, stays up there in his studio.
Won't speak to anyone.
Lives up there on pea soup which he cooks himself.
Has the peas and the pork sent by his old mother.
Even the onions.
From five till six, a stroll through the town.
From six-thirty to seven-thirty,
Reserve Officers' Club.
Paprika-cheese?
Very interesting!
And he draws, even at breakfast, like a man possessed.
I didn't know my wife yet.
I ask you for your daughter's hand.
The unforeseen struck me hard.
We'll find the culprit.
The Emperor's Speech:
I no longer see parties among my people.
There are only Germans among us.
And whichever party may have turned against me,
I forgive them all with my whole heart.
Now it is for us all to stand together as brothers,
for God to lead the
German sword to victory!
I let my son Heinrich play with the lancer's helmet which his uncles had given him.
And I put up with what the garrison commandant told me.
I'm so sorry, Fähmel, that we can't do without you yet, that you can't play your part in it, but we also need people at home, we need people exactly like you.
Construction of barracks, fortifications, hospitals.
The fool of a Kaiser.
The fool of a Kaiser, the fool of a Kaiser...
Court of honour.
And I did not say what
I ought to have said, that I agreed with my wife.
"Pregnant, gentlemen, due in two months;
"a little daughter lost,
"two brothers fallen on the same day:
"Captain Kilb of the
Horse Guards, Officer Kilb. "
And I couldn't summon up the courage to tear up the poem that Heinrich had to learn by heart for school.
Spoke Peter,
Heaven's doorman:
"I'll take the matter up in higher places. "
And lo, not long thereafter he came:
"Most Excellent Blücher, you are in luck!
"On leave for an indefinite time," said he, and opened
Heaven's door.
"Go, old warhorse, and strike there.
"Good old God will be with you. "
It was Blücher who came down
To lead us from victory to victory.
Onwards with hurrahs and Hindenburg,
Eastern Prussia's saviour and mighty fortress.
As long as the woods of Germany stand,
As long as the flags of
Germany fly, as long as...
I ought to have done what Johanna did then,
I ought to have spoken to the boy.
In his fever, he pieced his lines together.
"Good old God will be with you. "
Johanna tried to drag him out of his delirium, to shake him awake, but he never came back again.
"Onwards with hurrahs and Hindenburg"
...only this single, solitary line was alive in him.
Robert was not yet two, and Otto not yet born.
You must forgive me, Robert;
I couldn't bear it any longer.
I had to go to Dröscher to obtain an amnesty for you.
It was too much for us
... Father, myself, Edith.
Your son was already born.
We found your tiny messages in the letter-box:
"Don't worry, I'm studying hard in Amsterdam. "
"I need money. Give it wrapped in newspaper
"to a man called Groll, a waiter in the "Anchor" at the upper harbour. "
And all at once Otto was no longer Otto.
He brought Nettlinger and the sportsmaster home with him.
You know the conditions
Dröscher obtained for you: no political activity, and straight into the army after your exams.
Klähm, the statist, will examine you, and save you as many terms as he can.
Must you absolutely study statics?
Very well, as you wish.
Isn't he sweet, your little boy?
You must adopt him immediately after the wedding.
I'll furnish an apartment for you.
You should try to be reconciled with Otto.
Please, do try.
Please, go.
Even the news of his death did not bring a reconciliation.
Fallen at Kiev!
Sons of the same parents, born and grown up in the same house, gone the same way to school...
And suddenly not even strangers any more.
Behind Otto's pale, wide forehead was power in its simplest form.
Power over frightened schoolfellows, over passers-by who did not salute the flag.
He would have delivered his mother to the hangman.
Well? Did you speak to Otto?
No good!
I knew it, but one must always keep trying, again and again.
Perhaps there's only one way to set him free.
I shall do it, Robert.
I shall be the Lord's instrument.
I have patience, time doesn't press me.
One shouldn't use powder and wadding, but powder and lead.
Firecrackers do not kill, my boy.
You should have asked me.
Now he has become
Chief of Police.
Don't think I'm mad.
I know exactly where we are.
It's war.
Time can be read off in promotions.
You were a Lieutenant when you left.
After two years,
First Lieutenant.
Aren't you a Captain yet?
This time they won't do it in less than four years, perhaps it'll last six, and you'll be a Major.
Don't go too far with those formulas in your head, and don't lose your patience, and don't accept any privileges.
We won't eat a crumb more than we get on ration cards.
Edith is agreed.
I didn't want to allow your children to enjoy any privileges, either.
They should taste the truth on their lips.
But they took me away from the children.
I watched how time went marching by.
It seethed, it struck.
It paid a billion for a sweet, and then lacked three pfennigs for a roll.
I did not want to hear the name of the saviour, but they stuck his image on their letters, and recited their litany:
Respectable, respectable, earnest, honour-loyal. defeated and yet undefeated, order.
Dumb as earth, deaf as a tree.
And he, my little David, slept; only woke up when he saw how it could cost a life to pass a package of money, wrapped in newspaper, from one hand to another.
Loyalty, honour, respectable... then he saw it.
I warned him about Gretz, but he said: "He's harmless. "
"Of course," I said,
"you'll see yet what
"harmless people are capable of.
"Gretz would betray his own mother. "
He did it, Robert.
Just because the old woman kept saying:
"It's a sin and a disgrace. "
She didn't say anything else, only always this phrase.
Until one day her son declared:
"I can't stand this any longer, it's against my honour. "
They dragged the old woman away, stuck her in an old people's home.
Certified her insane, just to save her life, and that was exactly what killed her.
They gave her an injection.
They came to fetch Edith, too, but I didn't give her up.
I kept Edith until the fluttering bird killed her.
Forgive me, I couldn't save the lamb.
Step inside, bring some happiness in, old David!
Come, we'll say our
"do-you-still-know" prayers, and remind ourselves of the years when we lived out in Blessenfeld.
You had released me from that dreadful house.
They were already growing up, those to whom I was to be thrown: cap-wearers, beer-drinkers, guardians of the law.
I saw their hands, their eyes, and I prayed for him who would set me free,
I prayed and saw you over there at the studio window.
If you knew how I loved you, if you had any idea.
Have you got tickets?
Yes, but we've still got time.
Sit down.
A beer, please.
I'd very much like to give you something for your birthday, Father.
To show you...
Well, perhaps you know what
I'd like to show you.
I know, you don't need to say it.
Have you told Ruth we wanted to go to St. Anthony?
Yes, she's coming.
Is the abbot still there?
- Which one?
- Gregor.
No, he couldn't get over the Abbey's being destroyed.
And you, could you get over it?
After all, one can rebuild buildings.
And for your boy, it was a great opportunity to get some practical training, to learn coordination.
You know he has a girl, don't you?
No.
I don't want to know what mission Edith gave you,
Only... you did carry it out?
Yes.
Good.
I laughed at your childish conspiracies, but the laughter stuck in my throat when I read that they had killed the boy.
And later I knew that it had still been almost human.
I had thought I loved and understood your mother, but only then did I understand her and love her, and understand you all, and love you all.
Only later did I grasp it all, when one day the
British commanding officer came to apologise to me for their having bombed the Honorarius Church and destroyed the twelfth-century Crucifixion, when I would have given all the Crucifixions down the centuries to see Edith's smile once more, and feel her hand on my arm.
What did pictures of the Lord mean to me compared to his real emissary's smile?!
And for the boy who brought your little messages
...I never saw his face, or learnt his name...
I would have given St Severin, and known it would have been a ridiculous price.
We can go on to the platform now, Father.
Your Honour, it must be years since you were last here!
Ah, Mull!
How are you?
This is my son, haven't you met him yet?
Fähmel... pleased to meet you.
Mull... pleased to meet you.
Every child knows you here,
Your Honour.
Everyone knows you built our Abbey, and many grandmothers can still tell tales about you.
How you ordered whole truckloads of beer for the bricklayers, and danced a solo at the builder's party.
Is your mother still alive?
No, Your Honour, we had to lay her to rest.
It was a huge funeral.
She had a full life: seven children, thirty-six grandchildren, eleven great-grandchildren.
A full life.
Those are splendid people.
And are you not scared of them?
Scared of Mull? Now?
While you were away, and we were waiting for news of you,
I was scared of everyone.
Are you scared of Mull?
I ask myself with everyone whether I would want to be delivered up to him, and there are not many with whom I would say yes.
Over here, Father, over here!
He soon came out of prison and took us to the city, although Grandfather protested, and said that it would be better for us not to grow up among the ruins.
We were all living then in Grandfather's studio, because our house was uninhabitable.
There was a huge town-plan hanging on the wall in the studio.
Everything that had been destroyed was marked in heavy black crayon, and we often listened while doing homework at
Grandfather's drawing-table, as he and Grandfather and other men stood in front of the map.
They often quarrelled, for he always said:
"Away with it... blow it up!"
And he drew an X next to a black spot.
And the others would say:
"For God's sake, we can't do that,
"there are the remains of a lintel from the sixteenth century,
"and there's part of a chapel from the twelfth!"
And he threw the black crayon down, and said:
"All right, do as you wish, but without me, then. "
And the others said:
"But dear Mr Fähmel,
"you're our best demolition expert, you can't leave us in the lurch. "
And he said:
"But I will leave you in the lurch
"if I have to worry about every chicken-run from the Roman Age.
"Blow things up and make space. "
Grandfather laughed when they'd gone, and said:
"My God, you really must understand their feelings. "
And Father laughed:
"I do understand their feelings,
"but I don't respect them. "
And then he said:
"Come, children, we're going to buy some chocolate. "
And he went with us to the black market.
He always bought, but never sold.
Whenever we got bread or butter from Stehlingen or Gorlingen, we had to take his share to school with us, and he left it to us as to who we wanted to give it to.
And once on the black market we bought back butter which we had given away.
Mrs Kloschgrabe's note was still on it.
She had written:
"Sorry, only one kilo this week. "
But he only laughed, and said:
"Oh well, people need money for cigarettes, too. "
You'll like him, little lamb.
Fine.
But what did he do that made you suddenly lose interest in building?
Why won't you tell me?
Because I don't understand it yet myself.
Perhaps I'll be able to explain it to you later...
Here they are!
Another lemonade?
No, thank you.
But five cigarettes, please.
That'll be 90 altogether, please.
Do we really not know each other?
No, I'm sure not.
- Are you looking for somebody?
- Yes, the Schrellas.
Don't they live here anymore?
No, they never lived here.
Thank you.
Would you like a groschen?
My official speech will not stand as a mark of indictment, but of reconciliation, reconciliation also with those powers who in their blind zeal destroyed our home.
May I therefore extend an invitation to you, with the sincere hope that you will do us the honour of coming to the inauguration?
Many thanks,
Reverend Father.
Very pleased to have met your son.
I have sinned,
I have greatly sinned.
I did not want to see any recognition light up in
Erika Progulske's eyes, or hear Ferdi's name from her mouth.
Yes, Huberts, clear the tea away, and the bread and the cold meat as well.
I wonder whether the head-gardener could bring me a few flowers?
He's out, off duty till tomorrow evening.
And no one except him is allowed into the greenhouse?
No, Madam, he's terribly particular about it.
Then I suppose I must wait till tomorrow evening, or I'll get myself some outside.
You want to go out, Madam?
Yes, probably.
It's such a fine evening.
I'm allowed to, aren't I?
Of course you are allowed.
Or should I telephone
His Honour or Dr Fähmel?
I'll do that myself, Huberts.
- Good evening, Madam.
- Good evening, Huberts.
The exchange, please.
FIGHTERS' PARADE
Assembly in front of the Prince Heinrich Hotel.
Departure, 19.00 hours.
Prince Heinrich Hotel.
Oh yes, Madam!
Certainly, Madam.
Room 212, with balcony.
Do you really think that they might be useful to us?
- I'm sure of it.
- Without doubt.
But won't we antagonize more voters than we win through such a show of sympathy?
The Fighters' League is known as non-radical.
You can't lose anything, only win.
How many votes are there?
Under optimal and least favourable circumstances?
Optimal, around 80,000.
Under least favourable circumstances, around 50,000.
What will foreign circles think?
Yes?
Speaking.
Good.
Show sympathy.
I'll go down and draw the parade leader's attention to your balcony.
Go to our room, boy, and pack your things.
What will the old man say when
I present him for his birthday with a grandson who has
Edith's smile on his face?
You're right.
The voice of blood is false, only the other is true.
Don't you want to live with us?
No. The hotel room is just right.
Once I shut the door behind me, this town becomes as strange to me as all others.
There I can imagine
I must soon set off and give my language lessons somewhere.
The people I meet...
Am I deceiving myself in finding them no less bad than those
I left behind then?
The list of stereotypes has dwindled.
Nobody would've thought of calling your father a communist.
Even Nettlinger wasn't that stupid.
Today they wouldn't be able to classify him as anything else.
- Do you remember Enders, the ginger-haired boy? - Yes.
He's become a priest.
They've stuck him in a village that's not even reachable by train.
He's suspect because he made the Sermon on the Mount the subject of his own sermons too often.
I was thinking about whom
I'd like to see again.
But I'm scared of meetings, after having seen Ferdi's sister.
You saw Ferdi's sister?
Yes, she runs the drinks stall at the terminus of the number 11.
- Haven't you ever been there?
- No.
What are people like
Schweugel doing now?
Are you really interested?
Yes, why do you ask whether
I'm really interested?
Did you think about
Enders and Schweugel in your hotel rooms and pensions?
Yes, and about Grewe and Holten.
Drischka, too.
What are they doing?
Are they still alive?
Holten is dead, killed in the war.
But Schweugel's still alive.
He's a writer.
Always talks about bourgeois and non-bourgeois, probably regards himself as the latter.
What for?
It just doesn't interest me.
He has also sometimes asked me about you.
And what's become of Grewe?
He's a party-member, but don't ask me which party.
It's not important to know, anyway.
And Drischka is making
"Drischka's Auto-Lions", a patented article which brings in a lot of money.
While I was sitting downstairs waiting for you, some people were just assembling for a banquet.
And I heard something about "opposition".
They kept whispering in awe to each other the name of the star they were expecting: Kretz.
Kretz is a sort of star of the Left Opposition.
I saw him, he arrived last.
If he's hope,
I'd like to know what despair could be.
We must go to my father soon.
Or would you rather not go to the celebration?
Yes, I'll come with you.
We just have to wait for the boy.
Are the Trischlers really dead?
Yes. Alois, too.
He was taking them to friends in
Holland on the "Anna Katharina".
The boat was bombed.
Alois tried to get his parents out of the berths, but it was too late.
The water was already rushing in from above, and they never got out.
Where did you hear about it?
In the "Anchor".
I went there every day, and questioned all the boatmen until I found one who knew.
I'm scared, old man.
Not even in '35 or '42 did I feel such a stranger among people.
Just what do you want to do with that thing?
I want to shoot the fat man on the white horse down there.
Do you still remember him?
Do you think I would ever forget him?
All the same,
I wouldn't shoot him.
Look there, our old friend
Nettlinger.
I anyone, I'd rather shoot him.
But perhaps you'll consider: your grandson's murderer is standing on the next balcony.
Do you see him?
I'll rely on paragraph 51, dearest.
You probably don't know that all this is thanks to Father's zeal for blowing-up.
When they were blowing up the old guard-house, one of the vaults below collapsed.
Long live dynamite!
Remember how happy
Father was when he could still blow things up?
How do you find him,
Marianne?
Do you like him?
Yes, I like him very much.
Am I hungry!
I'm sure Grandfather's ordered something good for us.
You don't know yet, then?
Something dreadful must have happened.
Your grandfather has cancelled the party.
They just called from the Prince Heinrich.
I can't help it, children,
I can't be sad.
She'll be coming back now to stay with us.
He wasn't dangerously wounded, and I hope the great look of astonishment will not disappear from his face.
We got out of the car and got swept down the stream.
We caught on a tree, and my father-in-law lost his footing and asked me to grab the girl.
I grabber her, but slipped, and the little girl went.
Shortly after that the little boy he went, and soon after that my wife, father-in-law and the baby, they went too.
The three children that were lost, their ages, the oldest was six, and the middle one was four and the baby was three.
They haven't found the baby and the oldest boy yet.
The little girl we have and that's all.
To stop the devastation, the waste, the loss of life caused by the Tennessee River at flood, the Congress of the United States, on May 18th 1933, created a vast new agency called
The Tennessee Valley Authority, or TVA, and authorised it to build a series of dams along the river.
At the same time, the Tennessee Valley authority had to buy all the land along the shore of the river and all its islands.
Some people had lived on this land for generations.
Some people refused to sell, under any persuasion whatsoever.
Garthville.
Hi, I'm Chuck Glover.
I'm Betty Jackson.
I was Mr. Biggs secretary.
Do I inherit you, too?
I don't know. Mr. Biggs left so suddenly he didn't say.
You're inherited.
What desk should I use?
That was Mr. Biggs desk.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
I thought they'd send an older man.
No, they sent a younger one.
Shall we get to work?
I'll get the folder on Garth Island.
Getting the old lady off Garth is difficult.
You're the third one they've sent to try.
Ella Garth versus Washington.
Poor old Mr. Biggs was disgusted when he quit.
I'll bet he was.
Maybe, it could be he went about it the wrong way.
That man did everything anybody could do.
He begged and pleaded with her, but she won't budge an inch.
That's the American way of life.
Rugged individualism is our heritage.
3000 people sell, and Ella Garth won't sell.
We applaud that spirit, we admire it, we believe in it, but we must get her out of there.
The dam is finished and once they close those gates and the water starts to rise...
Well, we've not only got to get her out of there, but we must get the land cleared, the houses and trees down...
Be careful!
I guess I'm not telling you anything new.
Betty, how would you go about getting her off the island?
I'd let her drown.
That's one way.
How many...?
Is that the island?
Everyone of them bought up except that one.
How many Garth's live there?
There's many, but that old women, she's it.
They've been told the island will be flooded?
About a million times.
I guess I'll go out and talk to her.
You do that.
It's not that I think I can talk any better than the others, but I think we often underestimate the intelligence of people.
We can talk to them and they'll listen.
Well...
Well, what?
Let's see how you feel in a few days.
I'm off to see the Mayor.
He's in charge of clearing the land.
Wish me luck.
Have your cards and stamps in your hands.
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-We've been waiting, Mr. Davis.
Could you tell me where I'd find the Mayor?
In the barber shop.
Is the Mayor still in there?
Yeah, sure.
Mayor Maynard?
Be with you in just a minute.
All right.
The only way to get her off the island is to get a U.S. Marshal.
Except, we can't use force.
We're having trouble enough in Washington.
Some Senators are solidly opposed to these dams.
-Tom, how long are you going to be?
-I'll cut your hair tomorrow.
We've got to get those Garths off the island.
Bottled it Friday.
With no dispossess, no marshals, and no bad publicity in the papers.
You'll never do it.
I'll do it.
I mean, I'll try to do it.
There must be some way, don't you think?
Stay where you are.
There'll be 20 feet of water there.
We're a little behind schedule, but we'll make it before the winter rains.
Why don't you get more men?
Can't. Unless we use coloured.
Well?
Use coloured and the whites would quit.
For a minute there
I forgot where I was.
Here we are.
There's the island.
It looks deserted.
It's not. They're there.
They know you're here.
I suppose that means me.
T.V.A. KEEP OFF
Nobody else.
Well.
Here I go.
Good luck.
After all what can they do to me?
Just pull yourself over.
And let me know how you come out.
I will.
Hi, men.
-Who's that?
-I don't know.
Good afternoon.
I'm from the TVA.
And...
I saw your sign, unfortunately
I had to disregard it.
I'd like to talk to you.
Would you give me a few minutes?
If I was you I'd go now.
Would you give speak to me?
I have a problem.
We've just built this big dam down the river, and pretty soon this whole place will be water.
Everywhere it's going to be water.
That's wonderful.
What's your name?
Barbara Ann.
I'm five years old.
You're what?
Five years old.
You're not five.
You're at least six.
No, I'm only five.
Barbara Ann!
Yes, Mama?
Barbara Ann, where are the men working?
Barbara Ann, come in here.
Yes, Mama.
Uncle Hamilton and Uncle Cal are by the stream.
You mean, you get catfish bigger than that?
Some are bigger, some are smaller.
Well... about what I came to discuss...
Why don't you get out of here?
We don't want any trouble.
Trouble?
You're from the Government, ain't you?
Yes.
Go on about your business.
My business is with you.
Ma said we wasn't to talk to you.
You have to talk to me.
We do?
Look, you know as well as I know that you must leave here.
TVA has offered you a fair price and a new place just as good.
What have you got against a new place?
Too much work.
You work here, don't you?
No, sir.
Who does?
You don't do any work at all?
How do you manage that?
Just never started.
Ma owns this property and she ain't gonna sell it.
Certainly I can understand how a senile old woman would be sentimental about a place and not want to leave.
Perhaps, she doesn't understand what it's all about.
Ma understands everything.
If she understands, then what is she doing? These floods...
Ma knows about the floods.
Then I really don't understand!
Now, you just quiet down.
We ain't stupid.
I didn't say you were.
-Been reading your mind.
-Mister, Ma ain't selling.
It's up to you to make her sell.
Are you all afraid of her?
Joe John.
Don't say nothing against Ma.
What am I saying against her?
I'm saying that if your mother is senile it's up to you to make her understand she has to leave.
Ma ain't gonna.
She is gonna.
You know that.
Joe John.
Mister, you'd better go now.
Not until I talk to your mother.
Come on, take me up there.
What's so funny?
What's senile?
Crazy.
He says Ma is crazy?
I never saw so many men afraid of one...
What are you doing?
Hey, hey. Let me go!
Let go of me!
-Wake up, Mr. Penner.
-What time is it, Mrs. Riggs?
October, and you haven't got a job yet.
Want to buy a duck?
I'll sell Goo-Goo cheap.
I've been swimming.
Hello, Glover?
You sure got her off in a hurry.
Now start getting the land cleared.
What do you mean I got her off?
What's holding you up?
I've been here one half day.
Yes. There's a possibility that Biggs was right, the only way to get her off may be by force.
We can't use force.
What?
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
A couple of senators have got their teeth into us.
They'll use any incident to destroy us.
I know that.
I'll call you in a couple of days.
Right. Goodbye.
You wanted to see me?
Too bad about this afternoon.
Old Joe John is unpredictable.
What do you want?
Ma says you got an apology coming to you.
She's sorry about what happened.
Cal and Joe John are sorry.
Carol, she's sorry, too.
And me, I'm all busted up about it.
If you come tomorrow,
Ma will talk to you.
You better hang them up, they'll get crinkled down there.
What time?
Any time.
We don't go no place.
The say that President Roosevelt has a new government, you know.
It's called the New Deal.
What do you think of that?
You know anything about Mr. Roosevelt, son?
Yes ma'am.
I tell you Mr. Roosevelt is gonna flood this island.
Yes, sir.
He's going to take the best land in these parts and put it right smack under the Tennessee river.
You know these politicians, they gotta get the votes.
Yes, they gotta get the votes somehow.
So the President, he sits up there in that big White House, and says, "This country is just going to the dogs."
And the only way he can figure to do anything to stop it is to put my island under water.
What do you think of that?
I'm telling you this because our friend, in this end cabin here sneaked off last night.
Yes, sir.
He just slipped out with his family, in the middle of the night.
I ain't blaming him.
I ain't blaming him because nobody wants to be put under water permanent.
But I'm telling you all right now, don't go sneaking off in the middle of the night.
Any of you want to go?
Any of you want to leave?
The ferry is down there waiting for you just any time you want to go.
Nobody keeping you here.
Hi.
You go off and join the government.
I understand they're gonna put you on relief.
Now you just go and get yourselves relieved any time you want.
Me, I ain't going.
Sam.
Yes, Mrs. Ella?
How's "Old Blue" running these days?
He's all right, Mrs. Ella.
I decided I gonna buy
"Old Blue", Sam.
What's that?
You heard me,
I said I want to buy "Old Blue".
How much you want for him?
I wouldn't want to sell "Old Blue".
I didn't ask if you wanted to sell him.
I say I'm gonna buy him.
I gonna give you...
I'll give you 15 dollars for him.
What's the matter?
He ain't worth more than that.
No.
He ain't worth nothing, but I ain't selling him.
You gotta sell him because I'm going to buy him.
How am I gonna buy him unless you sell him?
I don't know, but I ain't gonna sell him.
Sam Johnson,
You is selling him.
No I ain't gonna.
"Old Blue" is mine and I ain't gonna sell him even to you.
You ain't got no right to make me.
That's true, Sam.
And come to think of it,
I don't have the right.
You see, young man,
Sam and me, we don't sell.
Sam don't sell his dog and I don't sell my land that
I've poured my heart's blood into.
Joe John.
Joe John is real sorry for what he done yesterday.
Ain't you, son?
That's all right, Joe John.
Mrs. Garth, sometimes it happens we can't remain true to our beliefs without hurting many people, and I'm afraid this is one of those times.
You're the only person who hasn't sold here.
That's all right with me.
Granma.
Yes, Carol?
What?
Nothing.
Young man, do you know anything at all about land?
I believe so, that's why I was sent down here.
When you go back to the ferry pick up a handful of soil.
That's real bottom.
Thousands of tonnes of it are being washed away every year.
Mrs. Garth, you don't love the land. You love your land.
You know the Tennessee River is a killer.
Year after year it's taken many lives.
Isn't it plain common sense to want to harness it?
You know what that will mean?
Today, 98 of the people in this valley have no electricity.
The dam will bring them the electricity.
I expect that's what you call progress, isn't it?
No, sir.
I don't.
Taking away peoples souls, putting electricity in place of them ain't progress.
Not the way I see it.
We're not doing that. We're giving them a chance to have a soul.
And it isn't just this dam.
It's dam after dam after dam.
We aim to tame this whole river.
You do? I like things running wild.
Like nature meant.
There's already enough dams locking things up, taming them, making them go against their natural wants and needs.
I'm against dams of any kind.
You can get me off by force,
I reckon.
It won't take much force, but it will take some.
That's the only way you'll ever get me off here, because I ain't going against nature and I ain't crawling for no damn government.
Mrs. Garth, we don't want to put you off by force.
What's going to happen to you?
Me?
I'll show you.
If you come with me,
I'll show you.
Now, read it out.
"Woodbridge Garth, born 1839, died 1889".
Now that one.
"Ella Garth, born 1853, died..."
I stay right here in this land.
The water would never come up this far, would it?
Young man, my husband come down this river in a flat bottom boat when he was nothing but a boy.
There wasn't even a road anywhere then.
He was looking for an island.
And he took this one.
That near field there was all trees, you know.
That one down there nothing but a damn swamp.
He cleared it.
He drained the fields, he cleaned the brush, he cut down them trees.
He worked himself to death just to make these fields and he told me never to get off, and I ain't.
I ain't.
I'm getting a little tired.
Goodbye.
Why haven't you gotten her off?
You know what's coming.
Don't look to me. I was born here.
I know what she's talking about.
You've gotta believe it, if she has to leave, it'll kill her.
People don't die as easy as that.
There's some people like that.
We'll get her a nice house with a radio, a modern kitchen.
You don't know her.
You love her, don't you?
And you're afraid of her.
Not really.
I think if anyone has a chance of reaching her, it would be you.
Was that your little girl?
I have a little boy, too.
One of those men isn't your husband?
My uncles.
Where's your husband?
I'm sorry.
How long have you lived here with here?
Since my husband died.
We lived on the other bank, in a white house. Did you see it?
Yes, I did. Yeah.
Well, when he died,
I just locked the door and took my two babies and come over here to Granma.
How old were you when he died?
Nineteen.
Nineteen?
And you have two children.
I plain gave up.
But Granma doesn't believe in giving up.
Yes, I kind of gathered that.
She gave me her savings and sent me off to Jennings college to better myself.
I tried it a whole year, but I just couldn't concentrate.
So I came back.
And I've been here ever since.
Certainly you have a fellow somebody who cares.
Yes, I've got a fellow.
Well, then?
What's that supposed to mean?
If you do have a fellow...
Yeah, a fellow solves everything.
I gather you don't care too much about him.
I'm going to marry him.
But you don't love him?
My children...
Everything is so confused,
I don't...
I can't wait much longer, he's getting impatient.
If you don't love him,
I wouldn't marry him.
You wouldn't?
You're a real romantic, aren't you?
I'll walk you to the ferry.
Come on.
You can't let a tough break ruin your whole life.
I know you can't.
Just like they say, you gotta snap out of it and take an interest in things.
I know you do.
The most dangerous erosion is not the land, but your capacity for living.
What you looking at, Sam?
Just measuring, Miss Carol.
The water won't rise until they close the gates.
How they get the electricity?
Is it in the water all the time or do they squeeze it out somehow?
No, Sam, it's the fall of the water.
The force of water coming down the mountain.
If you come down to the dam
I'll show you, okay?
Yes, sir.
What will you all do when the water starts covering the island?
-Let the white folks worry.
-We all gonna drown?
Of course not, but you've all got to get off.
Who's gonna look after us?
Who does that now?
Mrs. Ella, she looks after us good.
Wouldn't you rather look after yourselves?
I've got an idea.
Can all of you come down to the TVA office tomorrow?
We can talk about it.
Mrs. Ella won't like it.
Think about it.
I'll be in there all morning.
I want to thank you, Mrs...
I don't know your name.
Carol.
Okay, Carol.
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.
Will it?
Sure.
If we help a little.
There we go!
Do you mind if I come with you?
No.
Do you mind?
Do you mind?
No.
I haven't talked to anyone in so long.
I know.
The current will carry us across. Slowly.
Slowly.
What's that song?
It's just an old hymn.
And he walks with me.
And he tells me
I am his own.
And the joy we share as we tarry there, none other has ever known.
I think it might work.
What?
What you was talking about.
Come with me?
I want to show you something.
Sure.
Would you get me the key?
Oh, my...
You all right?
I'm all right, thanks.
This is...? is this the first time you've been back?
My, oh my.
I had someone straighten up a few weeks after, but since then...
There's that river out there.
Granma loves that river.
Maybe she could come here, sit here and look at it.
How come you never suggested it?
I just thought of it.
You never thought of it before?
I never thought I'd come back.
You really loved your husband, didn't you?
Jim.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can I ask you something?
When I told you about Walter...
About who?
Walter Clark.
The man who wants to marry me.
Yes?
You said that I shouldn't marry him if I didn't love him.
Yes, I said that, but as a sort of general rule.
Is he a nice person?
Yeah!
Well...
And I like him, but...
Maybe I'd get to love him, after I was married to him awhile.
You think it ever happens that way?
No.
If I married Walter, I could come here and live with the children.
And then, maybe Granma come.
But she won't, I know she won't, she'll never leave that island.
I don't know what to do.
I don't, I don't.
I just don't know.
It's getting dark out.
Don't go.
Please don't go.
Don't go.
And he walks with me and he talks with me,
And he tells me I am his own.
And the joy we share and we tarry there none other has ever known.
I don't understand. You're behind on clearing the fields and yet, here you have
12 able-bodied men who want jobs.
They want to work!
-I also said...
-Tom.
Not now, Jack.
I also said that we can't hire
Negroes. The whites would quit.
That's a chance we have to take.
Let's go out back.
You think if you take all the Negroes off the island the old lady will be stranded and will have to leave too?
It might work out that way.
You're heading into trouble with the townsfolk. Our customs is...
Look, this is TVA.
We're new, we don't have any customs yet.
I'm going to hire those men and every man, black or white, gets paid the same.
Mr. Glover, I predict your next visit will be from Mr. Moore.
We'd like a few words.
My name's Sy Moore.
Mr. Moore...
Come on in.
What can I do for you?
Thank you. Now Mr. Glover, we've come here to help you.
-Mr. Todd is President of our bank.
-Just fine.
And Mr. Thompson, he's our undertaker, also runs a furniture store, very highly respected.
I'm just a plain business man.
Won't you sit down?
I tell you this so you'll know who you're talking with.
You might say we're the responsibles of the town.
I see and you're here to tell me that if I hire Negroes the whites will quit, is that it?
Why, not at all.
What makes you think that?
Sorry.
Just have to keep them in separate gangs.
Keeping them...
In separate gangs.
All right. I will do that.
We were sure you would.
Now Mr. Glover, how much you planning to pay them?
You're not planning to pay them the same as the whites?
The jobs are the same.
-You look like a reasonable man.
-You do.
So just think, after this project is over we can't go on paying them as much as the white man.
Would ruin our whole economy.
The Federal Government can't make such distinctions.
Still, we prefer that you pay their usual wage.
How much do the whites get?
Five dollars a day.
You surely don't intend to pay these darkies five dollars?
I'll go out myself for five dollars a day.
I'll get you the biggest, strongest best-looking bucks in this country for two dollars a day.
We're all for the TVA and we want to help you, so if you'll cooperate on this point, everything will be just fine.
If I don't go along with you?
As I said, we're the responsibles of this town, but...
-There are other type of men here.
-Yes there are.
Men who aren't so responsible.
We can control them only to a point.
-Bailey's a good example.
-He runs the gas station.
He's a very good boy and he wanted to come too.
In which case the conversation would've been different.
We said to Bailey,
"Let's go over and talk to him."
-"Give him a chance".
-And that was all right with him.
We made it all right with him.
-We want to help you, but Bailey...
-Hard boy to reason with.
Yes. he is.
And there's a whole lot like him in this town.
Really.
We want you to know how we feel about it.
I understand your feeling.
I'd like to think it over.
Betty, would you ask them to come in?
You all come on in.
I'll be right with you.
Hi, Sam.
Here we are, boys.
Jerry, this ought to do for you and your family, until you find something of your own.
Boy, oh boy, who ever thought of that?
Yes, sir. We'd have trouble coming through mud tonight.
I'll say.
Goodnight,
I'll see you in the morning.
I've got them all jobs.
They're leaving the island in the morning.
Carol.
It's beautiful here when it rains too.
No wonder she doesn't want to leave.
You're shivering.
It's October.
I hate to see the summer go.
Look at the leaves falling.
Chuck.
Don't, don't, don't.
I don't want to kid myself or you.
I believe maybe
I'm in love with you.
I didn't think I'd ever fall in love again.
Soon this business will be over and you'll be leaving.
I've got to protect myself, Chuck.
I feel like living again now, but I don't want to be hurt any more.
Not by anybody.
Yes.
Do you want to come in?
I've been working here all day, and you know what?
I'm going to paint every room a different colour. Look.
That's all Jim's stuff.
Some boots and that old shotgun.
I don't know what to do with it.
Look, Chuck. Look at this sweater Granma knit.
It looks like something she'd do.
Stop walking around in front of me, would you?
Don't walk in front of me.
I'm sorry.
I'd like a drink.
I'll look.
What's the matter?
Stay still.
Don't.
Don't.
I'm gonna go.
Carol, did you know about this?
I had hints.
Hints?
Carol, you remember that yellow cat we had?
Come her season, we used to let her out at night.
It was dawn when she'd come back.
Now a cat is really quiet, but I could hear her at dawn, sneaking back into the house.
I know I done wrong.
I done wrong. I know it.
How long has Jim been dead now?
Three years.
That's a long time.
I remember when I was young.
That's a long time.
But I just can't understand going over to the enemy.
He's right, you can't stay here any longer.
Stop looking at me that way.
People say you're crazy.
I've fixed my house.
We can take the children.
We can't stay here any longer.
Well, you better go too.
I want you to go!
Tonight!
Go!
All right, I'll go, but I'm not going far.
I'm going over to my house and I'm going to wait for you.
Jim Junior, Barbara Ann!
Why are you sitting there?
Just resting.
Well, rest and then get going.
I've changed my mind.
I ain't going.
Get up.
Get up!
Never did have no brains, did you, Sam?
Don't you know what's coming?
Yes, ma'am.
You get going, Sam.
I want you to go.
I ain't going.
The ferry pole.
Granma.
We better go get some groceries.
Eight gallons at 18.
1.44 dollars.
Bailey, how's Alice?
Why, Carol, she's just fine.
Do you two know each other?
R.J. Bailey, Chuck Glover.
You're Bailey?
R.J. Bailey.
No, I haven't had the pleasure.
I'm happy to meet you.
That's a nice ready-made family you've got, Mr. Glouver.
Glover.
-Did I read that right? Carol Garth?
-I saw her, too.
You think Walter knows somebody's getting in his nest?
-I heard he knew about it.
-What do you expect he'll do?
He's so scared of what Carol thinks of him he might not do anything.
He might appreciate a little help in the situation.
As for those jobs, that gentleman is handing out...
We had a hard day.
Give him his supper and put him to bed.
What's the matter?
Afraid you're getting in too deep?
I don't want you to marry me.
Do you feel better?
That is it.
I understand how you men have to watch every step.
You can't be caught saying anything permanent sounding.
I'm not out to tie you down.
You don't have to say you love me.
Now will you come in?
It's just that I've been taking a good look at myself...
And you decided that you're not the marrying type.
No, no, it's not...
You've got so much to do before you settle down.
Don't, please.
Besides... let's tell the truth.
We're different people, aren't we?
You're... I don't know.
Everything different.
Do you ever need anybody?
Shut up.
Come here.
Don't.
Chuck...
The children.
Hold still, hold still.
Anyway now it's wonderful.
You can't get enough of me right now, can you? Tell me!
I can't get enough of you.
Let's put the kids to bed.
Let's put the kids to bed.
Jim Junior. Wake up, honey.
Hi, Jimmy.
Little rabbit, little white rabbit...
Wake up.
Chuck, will you carry me in?
Yes.
Jimmy!
You love me, don't you?
Walter, what are you doing here?
I came to help you clean up.
Aren't you going to introduce me to Mr. Glover?
I'm Walter Clark.
I brought in some eggs, milk, bread and coffee for breakfast.
You didn't have anything.
Oh, we...
You see, Mr. Glover, she doesn't even thank me. but it's natural to take care of the girl one is courting.
Get those kids to bed.
They look tired.
They slept in the car.
They look tired.
Will you sleep with me, Chuck?
You going back to town?
Yes.
Would you drive me in?
I'll leave my car here for her.
Do you mind?
No, not at all.
Well, say goodbye and let's go.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
You rest too, Carol.
You look tired.
Once this Garth business is over, will you be leaving here?
It ought to be over pretty soon, oughtn't it?
It has to be.
That's right.
It has to be.
You just drive me to your hotel.
I'll walk from there.
You do have my thought by now?
I have your thought.
You eat your cereal.
Well...
Which did you say your room was?
I didn't say, but it's next to the end.
You left your light on.
Goodnight.
And I want to pay you a compliment.
Carol could do worse.
Tonight, we open the jolly festivities, by singing the praises of dear old Redville".
What's the matter?
Don't go up there.
How many are there?
Just one.
He wants to see you...
Go on home.
BELL
Turn on the light.
There's only one of you.
I didn't figure I needed anyone else.
What do you want?
Remember my name, R.J. Bailey,
I run that gas station.
Yeah, I remember.
I also work 400 acres of cotton just outside of town.
I'd have visited you sooner, but we're harvesting.
Yesterday one of my best hands,
Ben, a real nice boy, ran off and joined your workers.
Five dollars a day.
When I heard about it,
I went into the house and got a stick about so long and about that thick, and I went to where he was working.
I didn't get out of the car,
I didn't want to shame him,
I said to him,
"Ben, get in the car."
When we got home, I took him into the barn and beat him.
He's all right now. I mean, he's thinking is all right now.
He couldn't work yesterday or today.
Had to hire another boy to do his job for two days.
So I figure you owe me what I had to pay that extra.
Two times two dollars a day, four dollars.
Yeah, Mr. Glover, you owe me four dollars.
I don't see it that way.
You need some time to think it over.
I don't need it.
You think it over.
Do you want one?
You see, Mr. Glover, if you keep stealing our best field hands at five dollars, you're gonna be dealing with my friends too.
What's keeping you here?
They tell me you're here to get an old woman off an island.
There's nothing to that.
I'll go and get her off tomorrow.
I'll go down and pack her up.
Wouldn't you like me to?
I want you to mind your own business.
I figured since you've been mixing in mine, that you wouldn't mind if just I mixed in yours.
But you're like me, Mr. Glover.
You do mind.
Well, how about it?
Four dollars?
No.
If you don't give it to me,
I'm going to take it away from you.
You may have some trouble.
Oh, man...
Good night, Sully.
Was you there, Charlie?
Then the air was full of hamburger meat.
Our friend in Number 3 needs change for this ten.
I think I have it.
I think you'll get your girl all right, Walter.
And I think our friend upstairs will be leaving town soon.
This is his change.
Take my four dollars and send him the best liquor you can find.
He needs it.
Okay, I am stubborn, but I can't get it out of my head that there isn't some way to reach that old woman.
After all, people are human,
I mean, people are human.
I don't know if Ella Garth is.
I don't care what you call her.
She was born, she'll die, won't she?
Mrs. Garth!
Mrs. Garth!
Mrs. Garth!
Who's there?
It's me, Chuck Glover.
Who's that with you?
That's my friend, Walter Clark.
You've been drinking that corn liquor, ain't you?
I acknowledge, I had a drink.
It seems to me you can hardly stand up.
Mrs. Garth, we've come here we want to talk to you as one human being to another.
Walter.
You better take this lunatic home.
I'll take him home in a minute, but I want to say something.
I understand you, Mrs. Garth.
I know exactly what you're fighting for.
It's your dignity.
I know!
I'm right?
It's your everlasting, ever loving dignity.
It's your dignity.
That's it, it's your dignity.
He's...
Well, he sure is.
He looks smaller than I thought.
That's right.
They're closing that dam Monday.
You got two weeks to get that island levelled.
We haven't got the old lady off yet.
Have the U.S. Marshal put her off as soon as you can.
-Or sooner.
-Clear the land!
But what about the bad publicity?
There'll be worse publicity if she gets wet!
Yeah.
I'll get to it right away.
Another cup of coffee?
Mr. Glover!
It's about Ma.
This here is Mr. Armstrong, our lawyer.
We feel that Mrs. Garth is no longer fit to handle her affairs.
We'll declare her senile and sell the property ourselves.
You said yourself she was incompetent.
Anybody that stays when the water is rising, must be crazy.
-The rest of us done got off.
-And Joe John and Mattie.
Under the law we can have her declared incompetent.
I'd rather have her put off at gun point.
I'll have the papers ready in the morning.
I've known her since I was a boy.
I hate to do this.
You hate to do it?
It all goes under the general heading of progress.
Yeah, that's what they say.
Heard you had trouble last night.
Any complaints?
All goes under the general heading of progress.
Mrs. Garth?
I apologise for the other night.
First and only time
I ever liked you.
Mrs. Garth, Hamilton y Cal came to my office with a lawyer.
They'll prove you're of unsound mind and unable to negotiate the sale of your property.
Worthless!
Can you hear me?
They was always worthless!
If they can prove it they can sell your land.
This whole island will be flooded in two weeks.
This house is coming down!
You can't stay here any longer!
Are you listening?
Marshal Hogue has issued an order for your eviction and tomorrow it'll be executed.
Come with me now.
Mrs. Garth.
What are you trying to prove?
Sam, all this is going to be under water.
I said a house with a porch.
It's got to have a porch.
So keep trying, will you?
When other helpers fail and comfort flees,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with.
Jimmy learned a new one.
Sing it for me.
Jesus loves me, this is know.
For the Bib...
Hi.
Hello, Chuck!
How is it?
Okay.
You look tired.
What you been doing all day?
Looking for a house with a porch.
Good night, Chuck.
Good night.
Frances, just put them down for me.
Get to bed, honey.
When I first came down here
I thought,
"How can one person go against what's happening in the country?"
There she's been, sitting there for 80 years and I was going to get her off in one day.
I was even looking forward to it.
Imagine.
And now, I have to make sure
I get her off alive.
Goodnight, honey.
Goodnight.
You're becoming human, aren't you?
I was always human, wasn't I?
Then you'll be leaving soon.
Not for a couple of weeks at least.
I have to wait until the land is cleared first, and stuff like that.
A couple of weeks?
Maybe more, maybe a little longer.
A little longer.
I'm going now, Mrs. Carol.
Good night, Frances.
Good night, Frances.
Here you are.
Chuck.
Yes, dear?
I hate to say this.
Say what?
Something I hate to say.
What?
When you go, take me with you.
One day soon, you're going to come to me and you're gonna say,
"Carol, I have to go."
And there won't be time to talk, or to think, or anything.
And there'll be a car waiting, and then a plane and you'll say,
"Carol, honey, I have to go."
Isn't that right?
Yes, that's right.
Take me with you.
Did I tell you what happened after you left with Walter?
No.
He came back here at the middle of the night and he nearly broke my heart.
How?
I kept saying to him,
"Stop looking at me.
I have nothing to give any man.
Except if I love him."
He kept saying,
"He'll leave you after his job's done, but I'm forever.
I'm forever."
He's right.
I wish you hadn't said that.
Why did you say that?
I know it's true, but why?
I know it's true.
I know.
I'm leaving here, with or without you, but I want you to know something.
I'd be a good wife for you.
A damn good wife.
I'm smart in some ways and I know what's good about you and what's bad and I'm not afraid to tell you.
I have two children who love you.
They love you and I love you.
And you're not easy to love, but you do need someone.
And I love you.
I love you.
It's stopped raining.
Don't say anything.
Don't.
I'm afraid of what you might say.
I don't know what to say.
God, that says it all.
That's not what I meant.
It's what you really meant.
It's what you are thinking.
I heard you.
I asked you and you said "no."
I heard you.
Chuck.
Anything.
What do you want from me?
I'll do anything.
I'm sorry to break in here.
I told you...
I owe it to him.
Carol!
What is it?
There are men coming.
Silence.
Turn off those lights.
Alden, give me that rifle.
-Whose truck is this, Buddy?
-Walter Clark.
Get out.
I don't know what's happening.
Mama!
I'm in here, honey.
I'd better pull down that shade.
Walter.
What happened?
Are you all right?
Chuck! It's your old buddy,
Bailey!
I've brought my friends along!
Got you all packed!
What are they doing with my car?
Excuse me, Barbara.
Don't you dare go out there.
Got your ticket bought all the way to Washington!
Got you a travelling mate.
How'd you like to go to Washington?
-What do you think?
-They're just having fun.
Mommy! Mommy!
You go...
Did you see that?
What are you doing in my pickup!
Get out of it!
Bailey, you damaged my house and you're paying for it!
-Time to go, Mr. Glover!
-Bailey, you shot at me.
-I shot at the lamp.
-You shot at me!
-Well, Mr. Glover.
-Sure is nice to meet you.
-Sure has been fitting to meet you.
-When are you going home?
-How's Eleanor up there.
-Who's Eleanor?
Eleanor Roosevelt.
My pickup. You did!
I'll see you to the train.
Glover!
Watch it, Chuck.
Bailey.
There's no way to scare me out.
I came down here to do a job and...
Carol!
Muss him up!
What that matter with you?
What are you doing?
No, no don't.
Let me go.
-Do you know what you just did?
-Don't hit a woman.
I don't want a word out of you.
Time to go beddy-bye.
You just smacked a woman right on the ground.
Don't hit a woman.
Don't hit a woman.
Who else is gonna say a word?
Go on, another word.
I want to hear another word out of someone!
Just say one word.
-Sheriff.
-How you getting along?
All right, I guess.
A little tired.
Why don't you all go on home?
Anything I can do for you,
Mrs. Carol?
Get off my place now.
You know...
I wish some day I could win maybe one fight.
You were wonderful up there.
I don't care if you ever win a fight.
Marry me?
I know I'll probably regret it.
I'm sure you'll regret it, but...
Get your hat, get a coat, wash up. All right?
All right.
"And now, by the authority invested in me by the State of Tennessee as a Justice of Peace,
I pronounce you man and wife.
What God has joined together let no man put asunder."
Five dollars, please.
Five dollars, please.
Anyway, it's got a porch.
I hope she likes it.
"You have refused to vacate said property you are therefore, hereby commanded to immediately and forthwith vacate the real estate, buildings, outbuildings, and the premises, designated as Tract 3, 4, 9, 6, 4, 7, and this you'll in nowise fail to do under the penalty of the law.
Signed, Allan R. Nealy,
District judge."
That's it.
What are you waiting for?
There she goes!
Well, this is it.
Granma, you look kind of tired.
Don't you want to go in and lie down?
Carol.
Yes, Granma.
I owe Frank Zachary
16 cents for two pounds of sugar.
You see that he gets it next time you go in.
Yes, Granma.
That's all I owe.
Anybody.
Chuck!
Well, here she goes.
Granma just died.
You had it to do. There was nothing else you could've done.
It looks like we're ready to go.
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Okay, go ahead!
"Truly, truly, I say to you she who believeth hath life eternal."
Barbara Ann!
London calling... with Frenchmen
speaking to their countrymen.
Take a look at that! What a handsome sight...
...the pride of the Third Reich!
The brave sergeant taking coffee to the beachgunners.
So that's a sample of the master race! In a pig's eye!
In this darkest hour, in the gloom of night...
...we must not despair.
For each of us...
...deliverance is coming!
We need mines and obstacles along the whole coast.
At every beach, on every dune...
...on every rock.
How many have been installed?
Four million, Herr Field Marshal.
The work has completely exhausted our troops.
Which would your troops rather be...
...exhausted or dead?
Just look at it, gentlemen.
How calm... how peaceful it is.
A strip of water between
England and the Continent...
...between the Allies and us.
But beyond that peaceful horizon... a monster waits!
A coiled spring of men, ships and planes...
...straining to be released against us.
But not a single Allied soldier shall reach the shore.
Whenever or wherever this invasion may come, gentlemen...
...I shall destroy the enemy there... at the water's edge!
Believe me, gentlemen.
The first 24 hours of the invasion will be decisive.
For the Allies as well as the Germans, it will be the longest day...
...the longest day!
The poem by Verlaine?
Play it back!
Frenchmen speaking to their countrymen.
Here are some personal messages.
"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."
I repeat:
"The long sobs of the violins of autumn."
Have you notified all commands?
If Berlin is right, when we intercept the second verse...
...it will mean the invasion will come within 24 hours.
Give me the text of the second verse.
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."
We've intercepted hundreds of messages in the last year... hundreds!
I've ordered alerts again and again.
Why should this poem mean more than other messages?
Tell me this:
Does it give us any clue as to where they will land and when?
Of course it doesn't.
How can I maintain discipline if
I keep my troops on the alert...
...just because a pair of nitwits in Berlin intercept a poem?
No, Blumentritt... no alert!
And especially not in this weather!
- Anything else?
- No, sir.
Good morning, Field Marshal.
- Any news?
- Nothing important.
Fighter bombers hit the Pas-de-
Calais yesterday afternoon.
Nothing much happened last night... the storm.
That's all I'm interested in this morning... the storm.
It came from nowhere... blew my roses to bits.
There are five-foot waves in the Channel...
...and winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour.
For the month of June...
...it's the worst Channel storm in 20 years.
My appointment at Berchtesgaden?
General Jodl will see the Führer today...
...and confirm the appointment for you.
Will you still go to Germany as planned?
Can you think of a better time?
The weather is expected to continue like this for another week.
Snap it up. Jerk the lead.
Snap it up.
Jerk the lead.
Snap it up.
Jerk the lead.
You expect us to eat this slop again?
I don't care what you do with it, mac.
Eat it, throw it out.
I get paid for cooking it.
Come on. Put it on.
Snap it up.
Jerk the lead.
Didn't you get any sleep?
Are you kidding? I haven't slept since we got here.
I got the absolute lowdown.
It's on for tonight. For sure.
Yeah.
I got in this crap game with this guy from F Company.
- He's an orderly for some general.
- Move it. Move it.
Hey, Hutchy!
Hutchy, I want to ask you something.
Hey, Hutchinson...
...do you think they'd let me write home? If it was really important?
Not likely, mate. Security.
I don't think old Churchill trusts us.
It's the wife, you see.
She's going to have a baby.
Your first, is it?
Oh, it's not mine, but I'm dead worried about her.
She's not too strong, you see.
Man, that stink.
Diesel oil, backed-up toilets, vomit.
And there ain't no place left to get sick in.
The puke bags is full.
The fire buckets is full.
All we got left is our helmets.
June.
Every June my old man used to take me camping...
...up in the Blue Mountains.
We'd hunt and fish all day long.
And at night...
...we'd sleep out under the stars.
Didn't even need a blanket.
June.
Wind and rain. Wind and rain.
Don't it ever stop?
Look, Dad, all I want to do is get going.
Wind or no wind. Even if we land in Paris on the Eiffel Tower.
- Come to think of it...
- Colonel wants us.
All of us.
All troops will participate in ground tactics and deployment.
In this weather, sir?
Of course, Harding, if you can ensure that we'll land in France...
...in sunshine and dry weather.
- Didn't mean that.
- What did you mean?
- It isn't the weather.
It's the waiting.
These men are itching to go.
I don't think I have to remind you...
...that this war has been going on for almost five years.
Half of Europe has been overrun and occupied.
We're comparative newcomers.
England's gone through a blitz with a knife at her throat since 1940.
I am quite sure that they too are impatient and itching to go.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir. Quite clear.
Three million men penned up on this island.
All over England, in staging areas like this.
We're on the threshold of the most crucial day of our times.
Three million men out there...
...keyed up, and waiting for that big step-off.
They aren't exactly alone.
Notify the men. Full packs and equipment, 14:00 hours.
Yes, sir.
This allows you more freedom.
Quicker to get rid of when we hit the beach.
- Well?
- It's on.
Tonight, as scheduled.
- If the weather isn't worse.
- How worse can it get?
Ike has called a high-level conference for 9:30.
I am not Eisenhower. I am an assistant division commander.
I don't know from nothing, but he can't call it off again.
Frank, turn that thing off.
Four thousand ships loaded for bear.
Troops ready to go.
Eleven thousand planes on the line.
Eighteen thousand paratroopers.
God only knows how many gliders.
Norm, relax.
RAF says the gale can stop as suddenly as it began.
So they told us yesterday and the day before.
Look, Norm.
We're all of us just as...
...dedicated to this thing as you are, just as anxious to get going.
And that includes Ike.
Now if he calls it off again, he knows what he's doing.
Of course he does. I know that.
I'm just thinking about those assault troops. 200,000 of them...
...out there on those ships.
They're probably seasick as hell.
Some of those men have been on those tubs for almost three days.
I say go.
Go. Weather or no weather.
No!
A hundred on the bone! Let's go.
- Hey, give me $50. I'm busted.
- I'm not doing so good myself.
Hey, lend me $50?
- Lend me 20 bucks?
- Drop dead.
Lend me $ 10?
- Fifty on a bet.
- I got it.
One, two, three, four, five.
Fifty!
Let me hear it, let me hear it.
- Five and two, four and three.
- Six! That's the way we go!
Seven points in a row. It ain't logical, it just ain't logical.
- There's a hundred out there.
- $ 100 dollars, $20 dollars.
Anything open?
- Forty more.
- Forty more.
You got a bet.
- Okay, you mother-loving...
- Just a minute. Wait a minute.
Here you are. Use this.
- You don't think I'd...
- I don't think anything.
I just like to hear the sound when it comes out of the cup.
That's it. Shake it.
Okay. Let me see what you do with it now. Go ahead. Shoot.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Seven!
- That's what I wanted!
Who put this cup in the game?
- Next shooter. Who's coming up?
- I'll go $ 100.
He's shooting a hundred.
Who's got it?
- Watch your side bets.
You got a letter for me.
Schultz, huh?
Yeah, that's it.
Thanks, buddy.
- How much did you take him for?
- Not much. Just a hair over $2500.
- Yeah.
Oh, man, $2500?
It's too bad you had to win it now.
What do you mean, now?
Suppose we take off tonight.
What will you do with it?
Five I take with me to Paris to blow on the broads and wine.
A thou I leave here for seed when I get back.
And the rest I send to my mother.
Oh, man, $2500. And in Paris.
You always was lucky.
Hey, remember that night in Fort Bragg?
I remember it.
You know, I think I sneak over there and give it a big whang myself.
Why not? What's to lose?
Damn it.
Why did he have to mention Fort Bragg?
I was lucky, all right, in that crap game.
Next day I break my leg in a jump.
And two months in traction.
That's more money I ever had in my whole life.
I know.
Man, I just know.
I wonder how long it takes to lose $2500?
Pint of sludge, Ted.
Oh, hello, Dave.
Hey, you seen Johnny?
Yes.
Well, where is he?
Come on, Dave.
I need my boots.
Johnny's borrowed them.
Where is he?
At the bottom...
...of the Channel.
You mean...
...he's bought it?
Ack-ack over Calais.
He jumped clean, but his parachute didn't open.
That leaves just you in the squadron, Dave.
I mean, of the old 1940 mob.
What's always worried me about being one of the few...
...is the way we keep on getting fewer.
Yeah.
Poor old Johnny.
Bad luck, it happening now.
- Now, then. What's the difference?
- He went through the Battle of Britain!
And now if the big show starts tonight...
...he won't be in it.
Look, will you please shut up about him?
All right, all right.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You heard something about tonight?
No, no. I haven't heard anything.
- What are you talking about then?
- Well, it's just...
- Go on, go on.
- I have a feeling it's on for tonight.
- That's all.
- A feeling.
Take your feeling somewhere else.
I've got a letter to write.
I've had this feeling since I woke up.
I've had it with me all day long.
I can't shake it off.
It's tonight. I know it is.
All right, it's tonight.
Suits me fine.
Tonight. This afternoon. Now!
I mean...
...as soon as I finish this beer.
- General, can you spare me a minute?
- Come in.
- Thank you.
- Can I get you coffee?
- No, thanks.
- I'll get some for myself.
Is it still raining?
On and off, off and on.
Sometimes I wonder which side God's on.
What?
I say, sometimes I wonder which side God's on.
Good question.
What's on your mind, Van?
I'm concerned about the placement of our drop zones.
Go on.
I know this is a hell of a late date to bring up something new...
...but you've given me a tough nut to crack.
- It gets tougher every time I try.
- I know, Van.
Sainte-Mère-Eglise straddles the only road the Germans can use...
...to drive into our northern flank.
But it has to be taken.
And it has to be held.
That's why I gave you the job, Van.
- Can I use your board?
- Of course.
Here's the town. Heavily fortified.
Down here is the swamp area that the Germans have flooded.
And in between, four miles from the town, is our drop zone.
Now if anything goes wrong and we undershoot...
...we land in this flooded area and are bogged down.
If we overshoot, we come down like clay pigeons...
...smack dab in the center of Sainte-Mère-Eglise.
That's why I gave the men training in low-level jumps near the villages.
So I've heard.
Got a complaint from the city council at Bexhall.
Some of your men overshot the drop zone and landed in the town.
- Tied up traffic for an hour.
- That's true, sir. I was with them.
Sudden crosswind hit us, swept us over the treetops...
...scattered us all over the place.
- Where did you end up?
- In the courtyard of a convent.
Relax, Van. Sit down.
The last few months have been a tough grind on all of us.
I hear you've been working yourself and your battalion hard.
Almost without a stop.
Now that we're almost at the end of the line...
...why don't you try easing up on yourself and on the men?
Sometimes a battalion can be sharpened to too fine a point.
Sometimes a commander can too.
Well...
...if there's any further delay...
...I request permission to submit a new placement for our drop zones.
All right. Put it in writing.
Make it official.
That's your prerogative.
But Ike has called a final meeting for tonight at Southwick House.
If it's on, we'll get the green light by 9:30.
- What are the chances?
- Better than 50-50.
Forget everything I said. I got the best battalion in this division...
...and they're ready.
Here it is. The latest report.
- It's Southwick House, sir.
- Stagg here.
Yes, sir. The new front's moving in much faster than we thought.
Yes, sir, it's definitely improving.
I'll be there, sir. 9:30.
- Would you like some more tea, sir?
- Coffee, and make it black.
Please.
One moment, Colonel Priller.
Why wasn't he court-martialed?
He shot down 132 planes.
Don't call me "Pips, old boy."
You were a rotten pilot when we flew in Russia.
You're flying a desk now, but you're still a rotten pilot!
What's that you're saying?
I'm squatting here on this
God-forsaken airfield...
...with only two planes... two stinking crates!
Oh, sure, sure... your orders were followed!
Now my squadrons are God-knows-where!
My supplies are all gone. What am I supposed to do now?
But Pips, we had to disperse our fighter squadrons... we had to!
Look what happened to our airstrips around the Pas-de-Calais!
The whole idea is absolutely idiotic!
You move us back instead of forward!
Sure, I know the weather's lousy and they probably won't invade...
...but what would happen if they did?
But you know I can't get there with my equipment for two days.
I tell you, you're all crazy!
Priller has always been a hothead...
...but let's not underestimate him.
What he says is not entirely illogical.
What's the weather report?
Slightly better over the Channel.
I wouldn't be surprised if...
- When's the next weather report?
- Tonight at 8, General.
Keep me posted on the weather.
You made my dinner reservations?
Yes, I did, General.
Cancel everything.
Shoes for my wife, I had them specially made in Paris...
...for her birthday... tomorrow, the sixth of June.
Please wish her a happy birthday.
Thank you, Speidel.
Why didn't they attack in May?
The weather was perfect...
An attack now would be embarrassing.
But I don't think we need worry.
Is the plan ready, sir?
Yes, yes, quite finished.
War games...
...theoretical invasions.
Rush to Rennes just to push little flags around a table.
Playing at war!
Do you win or lose, sir?
Have I ever lost?
But General, this time you play the role of Eisenhower.
I win because I go against the rules.
We expect them to cross at the narrowest part of the Channel...
...and in good weather. But that's too simple... too obvious.
I choose the widest part, in the worst weather... and attack here.
In Normandy.
And in bad weather!
Like now...
...bad weather!
Trying to pick a trend is difficult.
From a meteorological standpoint, conditions almost resemble mid-winter.
And Normandy?
High winds, clouds, and some fog over the beaches.
However, I can say with a certain degree of safety...
...that we can expect a brief period of fair conditions.
Let me summarize, then.
What you're promising us is a barely tolerable period of fair conditions.
Am I right?
Yes.
Conditions that are far below the minimum requirements.
That's all I can promise.
You've done your best, Stagg.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Well...
...there it is.
We've postponed the attack once already.
Now, either we go on the 6th, with only marginal conditions...
...or postpone again...
...in the hope of getting perfect conditions.
What do you think, Monty?
I say, go. Go.
I must remind everybody...
...that the American convoy for the Omaha and Utah beaches...
...they've farthest to go...
...must be given the order within the next half-hour...
...if the assault is to take place on the 6th.
We can't keep almost a quarter of a million men on ships...
...in embarkation areas, indefinitely.
The longer we wait, the more acute our security problem.
The next time...
...the tides and the moon will be right...
Not before July.
Gentlemen...
...such a postponement...
...is too bitter to contemplate.
A brilliant plan, General.
Unorthodox, but brilliant.
Fortunately, it's only a game.
I don't think we have much to worry about.
Eisenhower would never take the gamble.
Never.
I'm quite positive we must give the order.
I don't like it...
...but there it is.
Gentlemen...
...I don't see how we can possibly do anything else but go.
Wilson speaking.
Yes, sir.
It's on, sir. Ike's made the decision. Tonight, as scheduled!
Colonel Tomson speaking.
Thank you.
Next stop...
...Normandy.
God help us now.
Gentlemen...
...the day we've been waiting for has arrived.
Invasion! We're on our way.
General.
The orders have been given.
It's on.
Have the battalion commanders join me in the wardroom.
All right, Sergeant.
You men are the eyes of our airborne army.
You, the pathfinders, will have one job, and one job only:
To light the drop zones for our paratroops.
Along with the British and Canadians you'll be the first men...
...to land in France.
And remember this:
When you get to Normandy...
...you'll only have one friend:
God.
And this.
This...
...is Rupert.
Now, we are going to drop Rupert...
...and a lot more like him...
...behind the invasion area.
He's...
...a very extraordinary fellow, Rupert.
He's sort of a...
...one-man army, all by himself.
Let me show you.
Let me show you what happens when Rupert...
...hits the ground.
Sergeant, switch off the lights, please.
All right, Sergeant, that's all.
All right, come on. Simmer down.
Come on, up.
It's possible that Rupert and his men will do the same thing to the Germans.
Confuse them, make them look over their shoulders...
...and launch an attack in the wrong direction.
Ten-hut!
- The crickets have been distributed.
- So I heard.
At ease!
You're as ready as we can make you.
This five-cent toy...
...wasn't issued to you for laughs.
It may save your life.
You're gonna be landing in the dark.
On the other side of that hedgerow...
...the fellow may not be wearing the same uniform you are. So...
...one click...
...is to be answered by two clicks.
And if you don't get that answering click...
...hit the dirt and open fire.
I repeat:
One click...
...must be answered by two clicks.
Now, hang on to this gimmick.
It's as important as your weapon.
Do you read me?
Loud and clear, sir.
All right. One more thing.
Your assignment tonight is strategic.
You can't give the enemy a break.
Send them to hell.
That is all.
London calling with messages
for our friends.
"Molasses tomorrow will
bring forth cognac."
"John has a long mustache."
I repeat:
"John has a long mustache."
"John has a long mustache!"
No, not yet...
Oh, my Lord!
"John has a long mustache."
Make any sense to you, mac?
As I said last night, they're code messages to the Resistance chaps.
Obviously, one message means something to one group...
...and another means something to another group.
"There is a fire at the travel agency."
I repeat:
"There is a fire at the travel agency."
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
I repeat:
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
The bridge... in forty-five minutes.
We'll be back.
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
I repeat:
"Wounds my heart with a
monotonous languor."
"There is a fire at the travel agency."
The best hand I've had all night.
Let me see here...
Pardon me.
Pardon me, General... it's come!
Wait. Give that to me.
What's come?
It's the second part of the message.
The second verse.
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."
We can expect the invasion within 24 hours!
Put the Fifteenth Army on full alert.
Thank you.
You know, I'm too old a bunny to get very excited about all this.
Now... where was I...?
Oh yes, two spades!
It's almost impossible to believe.
Every dot represents a ship.
You got battlewagons, cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers.
You got assault craft of every size and every type.
The biggest armada the world's ever known.
Here.
You remember it.
Remember every bit of it.
We're on the eve of a day...
...that people will talk about long after we're dead and gone.
You wanna know something?
It gives me goose pimples just to be part of it.
You could call it one of them...
...crazy, quickie wartime marriages, you know?
Met at a dance at the USO and all that...
...but, I mean, I took it serious.
And so did she.
We didn't do it just for kicks.
- When did you get the letter?
- Week ago.
Two weeks.
Maybe I was wrong, what I wrote her.
I mean, she's a high-class model and all, and I...
I'm not the kind of guy to get married that easy.
I mean, it wasn't no joke to me.
But oh, man, we really had some wonderful times together.
And you think she's got a boyfriend?
Well, she never actually said so...
I mean...
You think I was right?
I mean, was I fair?
She can't get one without your permission, right?
You gotta give your okay.
I know it's the law.
They passed it for all the Dear Johns.
Well, I guess I better be getting back to the outfit.
Good luck.
You too.
Who was that guy?
The one you was talking to so long?
I don't know, Sparrow.
I never saw him before in my life.
Happy birthday, General... from your staff!
Thank you.
Will you cut the cake, sir?
I trust you don't expect me to eat it, too!
What's that?
Dummkopf, that's the "V for victory" sign. Three dots and a dash.
Ain't you never heard
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony?
Release point coming up, Major Howard.
Right, prepare for landing.
Cutting loose now.
Roger and out.
Major Howard, I cannot overestimate
the importance of your task.
The Orne River Bridge must be captured
before the enemy can destroy it.
It's a vital military artery, and the
enemy has prepared it for demolition.
It must be taken by surprise
and captured intact.
Your gliders will land at night,
without the benefit of ground support.
You will assault the garrison,
overwhelm it...
... and hold until relieved.
Hold until relieved.
Major Howard!
There's the bridge coming up.
Just on our left.
Right, link your arms.
Brace yourselves.
Feet up!
Hang on!
Smoke screen. Smoke.
Up the action, bucks!
Up the action, bucks!
Right, Tom.
Over the bridge.
Check for demolition charges!
Hello! Hello!
Clear.
It's working!
Where's the doc?
On the third glider.
There's no report from them.
Walsh.
Sir?
Tom, Ruskin and Royal have had it.
Take over.
On the other end of the bridge.
- What happened to you?
- Broke it on landing.
- Isn't the doc with you?
- No, he's missing.
We crashed in the river.
Afraid we've got a lot of casualties.
I'm all right, sir.
So are the boys.
- Okay, carry on.
- Right, sir. Come on!
Well, I'll be...
Hey, doc! Doc!
What are you doing there?
That's the German side.
Sir, anybody can make a mistake.
Sir?
The demolition charges have been removed. It's all clear.
Good. Corporal Smith.
Send out the success code words.
Keep sending until acknowledged.
- John, set up HQ in that pillbox.
- Right, sir.
All in less than 15 minutes.
Only a matter of time before they counterattack.
- What about the paratroopers?
- 7th Para might not get here for hours.
And Lovat and his commandos...
It could be midday before they get here.
The question is, how long can we hold?
Hold until relieved.
Hold until relieved.
It's raining again.
Thank you.
Did you get the list?
Gen. Schlieben of the 709th has already left for the war games.
The Commander of the 243rd left for Rennes at 18:00 hours.
Also, Zimmermann of the 352nd... twelve officers in all.
Yes, I know.
The weather is bad, so everyone enjoys an extra night in Rennes.
I don't like it.
Any of it.
So many key officers are away at the same time.
I don't know why, but I don't like it.
But the war games have been scheduled for a week...
Yes, for tomorrow... not tonight.
Advise all officers who have not yet left for Rennes...
...to postpone their departure until tomorrow.
May I remind you, General...
...that the Allies have always landed in perfect weather conditions.
North Africa... Sicily... Italy...
Yes, and always at dawn!
We're 11 minutes from the green light.
Now, once more, I repeat:
If, for any reason, we fail to hit our drop zones...
...move north by east.
North by east.
The Germans have flooded large swamp areas behind the coast.
Avoid them if possible.
We came here to fight, not to swim.
Do you read me?
Loud and clear, sir.
How'd you make out?
How did you make out at the game?
I lost.
Now we're both jumping clean.
I understand. And when will the Field Marshal return?
I see. Oh, well.
Just a moment.
The radar report.
We are getting reports of strong radar interference...
...and radio reception is jammed.
I realize this has happened before, but never this effectively!
And the...
Call the OB West? Very well.
Give my respects to the Field
Marshal when he returns.
Bye, Rupert.
Do your duty for God, king, and your country.
Call for reinforcements!
We're under attack!
- Are we late?
- No, but...
...we must hurry!
What is it?
I'll go.
Stop!
We said, stop!
Stop, or I'll shoot!
What are you doing here?
I live in that farm.
Nobody lives in that farm.
- It's abandoned.
- Show me your papers.
Hurry up!
Come with me.
Go on!
Put your bicycle there.
Hans!
Hans, where are you?
- What's going on here?
- Nothing!
Who is with you? I want to know!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Good luck at the war games, General.
Anything important?
Communications reports difficulty in contacting our forward posts.
The Underground again!
Some sort of rubber dummies have been dropped by parachute.
Rubber dummies!
Connect me with General Richter!
We can expect commando raids and other diversionary tactics...
...but I don't like this idea of dummy parachutists.
Are you certain?
How many?
What do you think of it?
Paratroopers...
Put it over there.
This is what they dropped, they explode on contact with the earth.
In the dark, they look like soldiers.
Perhaps these are what General
Richter saw, not real paratroopers.
When you create a diversion, it's for a reason.
Connect me with General Pemsel!
Dummies...?!
Rubber dummies!
I agree with you, General.
I'll call you back.
What about my call to von Rundstedt?
We haven't been able to reach him.
The main lines seem to be cut.
They wouldn't drop dummies...
...unless it was to divert our attention from something else.
In this weather?
In any kind of weather!
I must get in touch with OB West.
They're enemy paratroopers!
Blimey, mate...
...you'll wake up the whole blooming
German Army!
Fellas!
I'm hung up!
Fellas!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
Where have you come from?
Awfully sorry, old man.
Simply landed here by accident.
What's that?
Sorry I startled you.
I'm trying to find my communion set.
Your what?
My communion set. I've lost it.
Now listen, padre.
We've got no time to look for...
I'm sure that it was here that I lost it.
We're under fire, padre.
Don't you think we ought to...
You go on, my boy. Go on.
I'm sure I shall only be a minute.
Cor! Stuff a grouse.
I've got it! I've got it!
Glory be.
Now, my son, let's go about God's work this night.
Pluskat.
Hello, Pluskat! Do you hear me?
Nothing that I've heard...
The usual bombing, but quite distant.
Oh, yes, I can hear it.
Well, wait a minute.
Yes, just a moment.
Flares... but a long way up the coast.
Yes, Cherbourg is getting hit again.
There's probably nothing to it...
...but we have had reports of paratrooper landings.
I'll go to my bunker and take a look.
Thank you, sir.
Higher! Higher!
Louis, open your store.
We need more buckets!
Mayor Renaud, you must come with me immediately.
- Is it important?
- Very important, Mayor Renaud.
What's wrong, madam?
I was on my way to the little house outside...
Suddenly, I saw a man fall from the sky.
- A parachutist?
- Yes, that's right.
He looked like a big white bird!
- British or German?
- What?
The parachutist... was he a friend or an enemy?
I don't know. He disappeared without a word. Just "Shh!"
- Without a word?
- Just "Shh!"
Bonjour, madame...
... je suis amêricain.
Bonjour, mademoiselle...
... je suis amêricain.
We seem to be circling.
Maybe they're having difficulty finding the drop zone.
Je suis...
... amêricain.
Je suis amêricain.
Voulez-vous...
... mademoiselle?
Okay.
Go!
Go!
Paratroopers!
Anything new?
Heavy bombing over
Cherbourg as usual, sir...
...and now near Caen.
The lines to Stations 6 and 8 have been cut...
...but the direct line is open.
I'll stay for a while.
- Would you like coffee?
- Yes, thank you.
For God's sakes, padre, stop that damn noise.
I'm sorry, son. I'm afraid I'm lost.
Well, who ain't? Now, come on.
Two clicks.
I heard two clicks.
Man...
...am I glad to see you.
- You guys the 82nd?
- No. This is the 101.
Where's the 82nd?
Look, bud, we don't even know where our own outfit is.
Well, somebody's shooting at somebody.
Let's us go find this war.
Come on.
Maybe they're Limeys and ain't got no cricket.
They must be our guys.
Okay.
No.
Hey.
Hey, they were Germans.
Hundreds of planes have been flying to my left and right.
Toward Caen.
Now over the Cherbourg peninsula... something must be happening!
But what, Pluskat, what?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Has anything been observed on the beaches?
No... nothing.
Yes, I'll let you know right away.
Of course.
Are you positive that ankle's broken?
Compound fracture, sir.
Well, put the boot back on and lace it up...
...tight.
Don't get mad, I didn't break it.
And you're not walking on it.
- You're not going to try...
- Knock it off and do as you're told.
Yes?
A, B and C Company are scattered all over like we are.
Go on.
Conklin landed on a stone wall, broke his shoulder. I left him with a medic.
Any contact with F Company?
No, but they must be up ahead in the direction of Sainte-Mère-Eglise.
Well, go ahead. Tie it off.
Tie it off.
Well, here's where we are.
The northern edge of the swamp area...
...five miles from our drop zone.
Five miles.
- F Company?
- No, sir.
And we've got scouts all over the place.
We even picked up a group from the 101.
F Company were the first of the lead planes.
Well, give me a hand.
Can I have my rifle?
Well, we'll head out this way.
We ought to reach high ground and open country by daybreak.
All right. Have the men spread out...
...pick up any stragglers they can find.
- Pass the word.
- Right, sir.
All right, men, spread out.
Pick up stragglers you see.
Pass the word down.
All right...
...let's go.
From the latest reports, this is how I see it:
American paratroopers have landed...
British paratroopers...
The invasion...
Yes. Thank you, Pemsel.
General Pemsel is convinced that this is the invasion!
I do not agree with him.
This is my conclusion:
Normandy is the objective of a diversionary attack.
A diversionary attack, Blumentritt.
It's not the main attack. That will come at the Pas-de-Calais...
...where it was always expected.
Where we always expected it!
But we can't take any chances.
I want the reserve panzers moved up at once!
We need approval from the
Führer's headquarters.
They wouldn't dare refuse me!
Call the Führer's headquarters and insist.
Insist that the panzers be released to me immediately!
An invasion of Normandy would be against all military logic.
It would really be against all logic...
Well, that about covers it, gentlemen.
Most of you have had your feet wet before:
Dunkirk, Dieppe, Norway.
And we know what it means to be driven into the sea.
In a few hours we're going back from the sea.
And this time we're going to stay.
There's no time for any sob stuff about...
...England, home and beauty.
Remember, our people have had a rough time for four and a half years.
They've earned the final victory.
Let's give it to them.
And to our French comrades in arms,
I say:
Good luck.
Tomorrow morning, we'll take them.
Come in, Teddy.
Did you have to put it in writing?
I knew you wouldn't let me go unless I did.
You're putting me on the spot.
- I didn't mean to, Tubby.
- The hell you didn't.
You put that request in writing, made it official.
You're the assistant division commander.
And that's why I'm supposed to go ashore in the first wave.
That's where I'm supposed to be.
You know that.
You're important to this operation.
We can't have you knocked off on the first day.
But that's not the real reason.
Isn't it because my father was president of the United States?
And a great president.
And a great soldier.
He led the charge of the Rough Riders up San Juan Hill.
So now you've got to be the first man ashore on Utah Beach.
But that's where I'm supposed to be,
Tubby. That's my job.
Also, I've been there side by side with the men all through training.
They're used to seeing where I belong.
They have a right to expect me there.
President's son or not.
Is my request denied?
No, you know it's not.
Request reluctantly approved.
Thanks, Tubby.
Thanks a lot.
Say...
...how's that arthritis of yours?
Arthritis?
Haven't had a touch in months.
Glad to hear it.
The street...
...the bridge...
...the hotel...
...the casino.
One more thing...
You have been fighting everywhere for four years...
...in Abyssinia, Libya, Egypt, Crete...
But this time you are going to fight on French soil...
...in our fields...
...in our villages...
...under the eyes of our own people.
The Führer took a sedative, I won't wake him for these reports.
First we hear that the paratroopers are shot down plane crews.
Next they are identified as mechanical dummies.
If paratroopers have landed...
...it can only be a commando raid.
Is that a sufficient reason to send the panzers to the coast?
I will submit all reports to the
Führer as soon as he awakens.
I understand.
Jodl has turned us down.
He will not release the panzers without the Führer's approval...
...and the Führer is still asleep!
Will you tell von Rundstedt?
No, not now...
Not now.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Sit down.
This is history!
We are living an historical moment.
We are going to lose the war...
...because the glorious Führer has taken a sleeping pill...
...and is not to be awakened.
It's unbelievable.
Think of it, Kurt.
Don't ever forget it.
We are witnessing something...
...which historians will always say is completely improbable...
...and yet it is true.
The Führer is not to be awakened!
I sometimes wonder whose side God is on.
Can I...
...bring you anything, sir?
In my room there is a bottle of excellent cognac...
...Napoleon, unopened.
I was even saving it for a fitting occasion.
This isn't exactly the right occasion, but get it anyway.
Daylight at last.
A whole night wasted again!
Where's my dog?
He was here a minute ago.
Let's have one last look.
Not even a seagull...
My God!
The invasion.
They're coming!
It's the invasion! There must be five thousand ships out there!
Get hold of yourself, Pluskat.
The enemy doesn't have even half that many.
Well dammit! Come and see for yourself, you fool!
It's amazing.
It's beyond belief.
My dear Pluskat, where are these ships heading?
Straight for me!
General, in exactly two minutes...
...the fleet will open fire.
Your attention, please.
The Admiral has an announcement.
Soon we shall be engaged in battle.
To drive the enemy out, we must fire on our homeland.
This is the price of liberty.
Long live France!
There he goes, right on time... as usual.
They're landing!
They're coming! They're coming!
I'm not crazy.
Look, they're landing!
The Americans, the English and the French!
Do you hear me? What's the matter with you? What's going on?
You must be deaf! Can't you...?
Dammit can't you hear it for yourself?
We're under fire. Yes, under fire!
Those five thousand ships you say the Allies haven't got...
...well, they've got them!
It's wonderful!
Yes? What is it now?
Listen to me, Pips.
The invasion has started!
Put yourself on alert at once!
What the hell can I do with only two planes?
Where are the others, you idiots?!
Priller, that's an order! Get ready at once! Understand?
If it isn't too much trouble...
...would you tell me where the invasion is?
Normandy! How delightful!
Thanks my faithful Hans.
That's the end for us! So long!
It's getting very difficult to get any sleep around here.
Your prospects for a long sleep are excellent. The invasion has begun.
We're flying there, the two of us.
Nobody else is left.
I don't think we're coming back.
The shelling has stopped.
Landing craft approaching.
Return to headquarters. Direct your troops from there!
Landing craft approaching the coast!
Those French bastards!
Sergeant!
Send this to headquarters by courier.
No! Take it yourself. Tell them our lines are cut!
Gentlemen, come here please.
There it is, men.
Omaha Beach, dead ahead.
Lock on the target!
Stand by!
Get off of the beach!
Let's go!
Come on, move up!
Hello, General, sir.
Are you all right, boy?
Yes, sir.
Don't you think you better go back and get your rifle?
Out there, sir?
You're almost sure to need it before this day is over.
Yes, sir.
Come on! Move on up! Let's go.
Medic!
Medic!
General, first reports from Omaha, sir.
"Assault teams have landed.
No direct radio contact, but destroyers report...
...first and second waves appear pinned down on the beach.
Concentrated artillery and mortar fire.
Third wave floundering."
Heavy casualties, sir.
When the mortars and machine guns are silenced...
...have the battalion commanders join me...
...over there.
Okay.
Hang on to that map case, Eddie.
I made it.
Hey, I made it.
Did you see me get those two guys?
Hey, Sergeant?
Sergeant?
As best as I can figure it, this is the wrong beach.
We're a mile and a quarter south of where we were supposed to land.
We should be up there.
Control boat must've been confused by the naval bombardment smoke.
I agree with you, but what will we do now?
Our reinforcements and heavy equipment will approach in a very few minutes.
- I know, I know.
- What if they land at the right beach?
The reinforcements will have to follow us wherever we are.
We're starting the war from right here.
- Head inland. We're going inland.
- Okay, let's go.
Follow me. Do everything I do!
All right. Let's go!
Head for home!
The Luftwaffe has had its great moment!
Stand by to beach.
Duncan, take care of that strongpoint.
Any minute now. Stand by!
Let's give it them back for Dunkirk!
You hear that? Dunkirk.
Do you hear it, Clough?
Sure he was at school at the time.
Come on, you bums!
Come out, you dirty slobs!
Flanagan's back!
The evil of it all. Drowning a man before he fights.
Oh, come on!
Keep those vehicles moving!
MP, chase out those cyclists.
Get off the beach! Move inland!
Come on, you lot!
Hurry it up.
Never mind the blathering!
We must put these down somewhere.
The sooner you get off the beach...
...the sooner they'll stop this blasted shelling.
It's very bad for the dog!
Down, Winston, down!
Beach Master Sword, Section 2-A.
Third wave ashore on time.
No obstruction to follow-up.
Standing by.
Get going!
For heaven's sake, get that carrier off the beach!
I was told I could transmit a newsflash on your radio.
If you can't drive it, carry it!
You were saying?
I was told I could transmit a newsflash on your...
My dear fellow, I don't want to appear uncooperative...
Yes, I know all about the power of the press.
But this line happens to be rather busy! Come on!
Down, Winston. Down, Winston.
What did he say?
The answer is no.
We have to use the damn pigeons.
I've got these ready.
Here, clip this on.
They're going the wrong way.
Not toward the Germans, you idiots!
The other way! The other way!
Damned traitors!
- Hold it.
- Can't you get your finger out?
What's the matter?
Engine won't start, sir.
Full of seawater, I think.
My old grandmother used to say...
...anything mechanical, give it a good bash.
Try it now.
Thank you, sir.
Off you go. Good luck.
I'm sure that got it out.
That's what I call a hell of a man!
Aye, I like his dog too.
Don't stand there yapping!
This isn't Hyde Park Corner!
The war's over there!
Come along!
Come on!
- Thank you.
- Everything's going according to plan.
Stand by to move.
Millin, "Blue Bonnet."
What in God's name...?
Oh, my friends. What a day!
What a day!
Welcome to France.
Welcome to Colleville!
Most kind of you.
Very nice to meet you...
Look at this. I kept it for you all.
But I don't think there will be enough for everyone.
Perhaps next time. We have a previous engagement: The war!
Mustn't lose that champagne!
All right, men, fall in!
Millin, "Blue Bonnet."
Goodbye.
Thank you, boys! Thank you!
Long live France!
Long live the Allies!
If you ask me, Flanagan...
...there's a lot of very peculiar blokes on this beach.
Welcome!
Welcome to you all!
Thank you, dear, they're lovely!
Better try them on first.
Rommel speaking.
Good morning.
What?
What!
Where?
Normandy!
Have they a foothold already?
They must be thrown back!
What about the panzer reserves?
Did von Rundstedt obtain their release from the Führer?
Normandy!
How stupid of me!
There it is.
You mean to tell me that's all we gotta climb?
They're not as high as the practice ones.
They wasn't shooting at us then.
Why can't the Air Force or Navy do this job?
The big guns in bunkers behind the cliff can't be seen from the air.
We knock them out or they'll murder our guys on the beach.
Yeah, well if you ask me...
...three grandmothers with brooms could sweep us off there...
...like flies off of a sugar cake.
That's it, the one we're after.
It's empty.
The Air Force and Navy really plastered this baby.
But I don't get...
The guns.
There ain't no mounts.
They've never even been installed.
You mean...
...we come up all this way...
...for nothing?
Don't worry, sarge, you'll be all right.
Medic! Medic!
I wonder what "bitte, bitte" means?
What the hell are you wearing a life preserver for?
I can't swim.
Normandy. It really is Normandy.
This is madness... madness... sheer madness!
I just talked to General Jodl... the Führer is awake.
I don't care if he's awake or not!
What about the reserve panzers?
The Führer went into one of his tantrums...
...and no one dared bring up the subject.
They're still held in reserve!
Yes, Field Marshal.
Sir, if you would call the Führer yourself...
...I am convinced he would respect your views.
Call him?
Call that Bohemian corporal?!
Crawl on my knees to him?!
No! It is out of the question!
"Wounds my heart with a monotonous languor."
What's that?
Nothing... nothing of importance.
Here, let me help you.
You all right, Tom?
Come on, they're up there.
- Sir.
- Well?
Mr. Smith says to tell you he's stood his men too.
The Jerries are moving up into the woods...
...with machine guns and mortars.
- Tell the men to stand firm!
- Tell the chaps...
Tell them to expect another counterattack, a heavy one.
- Here you are, mate.
- Ta.
What's the matter?
Listen. I thought I heard bagpipes.
Don't be daft!
I told you I heard bagpipes!
It's the reinforcements.
It's Lovat!
Come on!
Come on!
- Sorry I'm late.
- Better than never, sir.
Glad to see you, Shimmy.
You boys are right on target.
What's the situation?
Jerry's regrouping in the woods, about a mile.
With mortars and machine guns.
Numbers?
No idea, Shimmy, but they seem to be moving forward in force.
In that case, we won't wait.
We'd better get moving.
All right, we're going across.
- Millin!
- Sir?
"Black Bear," sir.
All right, come on.
Everybody up!
On your feet!
There he goes. He's at it again.
Ever hear such a bleeding racket in all your life?
Yeah, it takes an Irishman to play the pipes.
Hold until relieved.
Hold until relieved.
North by east, north by east.
Sainte-Mère-Eglise is that way.
Somebody turned that sign around.
Doesn't anybody in this outfit look at a compass besides me?
Hey, you guys!
Over here! Over here!
Over here, on the double.
- Where you taking that?
- We don't know, sir.
We took the wrong road.
What do you got in here, ammo?
Yes, sir.
You 82nd?
No, sir, 101.
Well, you're in the 82nd now.
- But, sir, we're...
- But what?
Nothing, sir.
All right, move out.
- Knock that sign down!
- Yes, sir.
- Something's moving up there, colonel.
- Hit the dirt! Take cover.
Lieutenant Sheen, sir, A Company.
Colonel, it's me!
- Where did you come from?
- Sainte-Mère-Eglise.
We hold the main road and north side of the square.
The Germans have a battery on the other side of the town...
...and command the countryside.
- And Major Lance?
- Holed up in a building in the square.
- F Company?
They overshot the drop zone and landed in the middle of the town.
Go on.
It was a nightmare, sir. A slaughter.
They were mowed down before they hit the ground.
Major Lance sent me to try and contact you, sir.
He wants your permission to pull back and regroup outside of town.
No, damn it. We came here to take Sainte-Mère-Eglise.
We're gonna take it and hold it.
Follow the lieutenant, gentlemen.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
British and Canadians advancing steadily from Sword, Gold, and Juno.
Anything from Omaha?
Nothing since the first message:
Heavy fighting, heavy casualties.
Sir.
Omaha?
No.
I can't understand why Jerry hasn't brought his heavy armor into play.
All the panzer divisions except the 21 st...
...seem to be sitting it out in the rear.
Sir.
French commandos driving inland from Sword...
...have reached the outskirts of Ouistreham.
Ouistreham.
Fall back!
Take cover!
Tank support!
We must have tank support!
I can't get them!
Keep trying! We must have support!
Hold your positions...
I'm going for a tank!
Give us as much cover as you can!
Fire!
Try for the cannon!
Get the wounded out of here!
Go back!
Get out of here!
You can't stay here!
I am Mother Superior of the convent.
The sisters are qualified nurses.
But Madame... I mean, Mother, we're in the middle of a battle!
Take care of the wounded.
It's a tank!
It's Kieffer!
In the other direction!
Clear away the debris! Hurry!
But where is the Luftwaffe?!
I'm trying...
Yeah, yeah, you're trying.
The British troops have a beachhead here. They are moving inland.
The Americans hold Ste-Mère-Eglise and have cut the highway.
We control this center section.
The Americans have landed but their attack has bogged down.
Rommel is right...
If we can hold them on the beaches...
...the invasion will collapse.
That thing still work?
Yes, sir, now and then.
- Anything from the other beaches?
- Not directly.
A while ago the sergeant picked up some flashes from the destroyers.
The 4th Division is off Utah Beach and moving inland.
Inland?
- What about the 1 st Division?
- They're hung up, sir.
Like we are.
Move out.
- What do you think?
- Think?
We must have close to a thousand casualties up to now.
Do you want me to have the ships start picking us up?
- You think it's that bad?
- I don't see what else to do.
We can't get up this hill.
If we don't get off this beach, we won't have any division left.
What?
These are our men, Tom.
You think we brought them in so some die and ask the rest to turn tail?
Hell, no.
We're gonna get up that hill.
Find me somebody to speak for the Rangers.
Back down the beach on the right there's a gully.
With a heavily defended roadblock and machine gun nests on both sides.
- If we can blow our way through...
- We've hit it three times.
- We didn't get close.
- Three times isn't enough.
We're gonna hit it again.
Can you find me some engineers?
They're all around you!
I mean engineers with equipment still working.
Then I shouldn't radio the ships?
No, damn it!
We need bangalore torpedoes, bazookas, mortars, wire cutters...
...and every man that can stand.
Pass the word, will you?
Okay, Norm.
Now listen to me, all of you.
You guys got to snap out of it.
We're getting off of here, and we're going inland.
What about weapons, General?
My men lost everything.
They gotta have something to fight with.
Strip the dead and the wounded.
Pick up anything that'll shoot.
I don't have to tell you the score, you all know it.
Only two kinds of people are gonna stay on this beach:
Those that are already dead and those that will die. Get off your butts!
You guys are the fighting 29th!
I've looked at the naval reports.
Yes?
According to reports from the offshore destroyers, Omaha is a shambles.
There's no evidence...
To quote the report exactly:
"There is no evidence of any movement that can be observed off the beach."
I'd better have a look through these.
How is Ike taking it?
Like everybody else, sir.
Hanging on by his fingernails.
No, no! We must regroup according to Plan Six!
Can you hear me?
I said we must regroup according to Plan Six.
Nonsense!
If the panzers arrive, we still have time to use them.
We'll drive to the coast!
Shall we remove the files?
I don't care! I want to get to the front at once... to Normandy!
Yes, General.
- Where is everybody?
- What?
I said, where is everybody?
I can't hear you.
It's them bells.
I've had them in my ears for 10 hours.
Ding-dong, ding-dong.
Hey, Sergeant, where's Major Lance?
We moved the CP to that building. The major's there.
Get him, the colonel's here.
What?
Hold it!
Colonel, am I glad to see you!
Those bodies. Get those bodies down.
Why are you leaving them up there?
Get them down!
But we've been under fire, sir.
I know you have, but I don't care!
Get them down! Down!
- I don't want those boys left there.
- Take a detail and cut them down.
- At once!
- Yes, sir.
Has there been a linkup between our forces and the troops from the sea?
I don't know, Major. I don't even know if the landings took place.
But I am sure we're gonna hold this town until the linkup does come.
Whenever that is, today, tomorrow, till hell freezes over.
For their sake, if for no other reason.
Show me the enemy positions.
Well, sir, the Germans' strong point is right there.
That's over there on the hill.
They've got no tanks yet.
They've got heavy guns and machine gun positions at the top of that road.
How many men have you got?
Not enough.
Lt. Wilson will take A Company and reinforce Major Lance.
The rest of the command will follow us straight up that road.
Good luck, Major.
All right, A Company, fall out.
- Private.
- Yes, sir.
It's a helluva war.
It's a privilege to serve with you, colonel.
Well, God willing, we'll do what we came here to do.
Ready, sir.
Move out!
The old man sure has changed since yesterday.
Or maybe it's just that we've changed...
...since yesterday.
Lovat and his commandos have reached the bridge.
Bob, did you hear?
Yes, I heard.
"Sainte-Mère-Eglise captured by units of the 82nd Airborne."
"101 Airborne driving on Utah."
That's good. Good.
Yes, but if we can't get off Omaha it doesn't mean a damn. We know it.
We'll have two cut-off beachheads, one in British zone and one at Utah.
Yes...
...and the Germans in between.
You guys engineers?
Yes, sir. 299th.
Where are your officers?
Who's in charge here?
I guess I am, sir.
None of our officers made it in.
What about your equipment?
Those torpedoes work?
Yes, sir, we'll make them work!
- What's your name, Sergeant?
- It's Fuller, sir, John H.
You're Lieutenant Fuller from now on, whether you like it or not.
You send some men down to the foot of that gully with those torpedoes.
You and the rest of the men follow me.
Yes, sir!
All right, men!
Let's move that equipment down here.
- I got a rifle, sir.
- Well, good for you, son!
The Rangers are ready, General.
Okay, Major, move them out.
Captain, move them up.
Move them up!
- Well, Tom?
- We're ready.
As ready as we'll ever be.
It'll work. It's got to work.
We're getting murdered here! We might as well move inland and get murdered!
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.
You're gonna blow that roadblock for me.
When I give the word everything pops at once. Okay?
Yes, sir.
First, we gotta blow a hole through that wire with bangalores.
If that works, we'll pack everything we've got into that wall.
All right, let's go!
All right, let's go! Go! Go!
We must leave. The main highway is under aerial attack.
You don't say!
Don't worry, Yank.
He's dead.
Give me a cigarette.
I'm dying for a cigarette.
You hurt bad?
Shot down during the night.
He was gonna make sure of me, but I got him...
...with this.
You ever killed a man?
I mean, face to face?
No.
Neither had I, face to face.
I've been sitting here looking at him.
Have you noticed anything peculiar about him?
No.
He's got his boots...
...on the wrong feet.
He must have been in a big hurry, huh?
Is it bad?
Split wide open...
...from the crotch to the knee.
A medic came along and gave me a shot of morphine.
I hope he'll be back before it wears off.
He said he would.
Did he sew you up?
Well, when he came to shore he lost most of his equipment.
So he pinned it together...
...with safety pins.
Getting on toward night.
You know something?
I haven't fired my gun all day.
I keep hearing shooting, but every time I get there, everybody's gone.
Funny, isn't it?
He's dead.
I'm crippled.
You're lost.
I suppose it's always like that.
I mean war.
I wonder who won.
Okay, run me up the hill, son.
The Round-Up
Pest Buda.
The 1860's.
The industrial revolution, enrichment...
The age of Ferenc Deák, Gyula Andrássy,
Kálmán Tisza.
The spirit of 1848 is no more than a phrase,
only the welfare of the bourgeoisie is important.
The people have lived the same way for centuries.
Indeed, the lean years, following one after another,
from the middle of the '60's, have increased their destitution.
Criminal cases are multiplying,
as are the desperate attempts
by those born in poverty to break free.
The regime is pitiless.
It seeks the outlaws and highwaymen everywhere.
They are the last vestige of active resistance.
They are criminals in the eyes of officials,
they are freedom fighters in folk songs.
In 1869 Count Gedeon Raday was appointed Commissar
with a specific sphere of authority.
His task - to create material security.
His main target - the outlaws.
He wasn't particular about his methods.
- Is it them?
- Yes.
- Your husband and your son?
- Yes.
Please come with me.
Stop here.
- Do you have any relatives?
- Yes.
- Parents?
- Yes.
Don't be surprised if they never see you again.
- I won't.
- Won't you?
- No.
- Why not?
You people don't really like my kind.
I speak four languages and I've often been abroad.
You smuggled in Kossuth's papers in those days.
- I was young.
- Yes, you were young.
You may go now.
Line up!
All in order.
- Bring them closer.
- Come closer!
- Any hard cases?
- Yes.
Which one?
- That one.
- Any more?
And that one with the cape.
- The short black cape?
- Yes.
Let's go.
- Are you János Gajdor?
- I am.
Come over here.
Are you a farmer?
Yes, I am. I have three farms.
Are you a self-seeker?
- That's what they say.
- A clever man?
They say so.
Do you know whether in your area there are any renowned herdsmen?
There are.
- Shepherds?
- Those too.
Who, for instance?
The Kecsege Szûcs family, the Ferde Balogs, Kis Balogs...
- Kis Balogs?
- Yes.
Did you know the Kis Balogs?
- I know them.
- I didn't ask if you know them.
- I asked if you knew them.
- I knew them.
Well, the Kis Balogs are dead.
They were strangled.
They were renowned shepherds.
Renowned and wealthy, too.
- Wealthy.
- Did they have quality sheep?
Yes.
A lot of their sheep vanished.
Renowned sheep, quality sheep.
Do you know how they were strangled?
- No. No, I don't.
- With a halter.
With this halter.
Don't you recognise it?
- No.
- Take it in your hand.
- Are you frightened of it?
- No.
Seeing you've taken it, put it around your neck.
Men were killed with it.
You're not frightened of it?
- No.
- Didn't you kill them?
No, no. I don't kill people.
I'm self-seeking, but I don't kill people.
- You're not frightened, then?
- No.
Then keep it around your neck and tie a bow.
I can do that.
- Finished?
- Yes.
Good.
You may go. Take him away.
Please, stop.
Come here, János Gajdor.
Go inside.
- I killed them.
- Come on.
Do you know the penalty for killing them?
I do.
Ease your conscience, have you killed others apart from them?
Yes, I have. But not many.
Who and what?
Would you tell me?
For your conscience and maybe your fate.
Well, I've killed... three other people.
- Three?
- Yes.
Gabor Telkes in '61, then two years later,
Palkó János Czeder.
Then, in '66...
No, in '67, Feri Csulak.
- This Feri Csulak...
- We know who he was.
Maybe it doesn't count that I killed him.
Maybe.
I don't know.
So, János Gajdor, there is a solution for you.
If, at the earthworks, you find anyone more guilty than you... someone who killed more people... then you'll be pardoned.
We won't hang you.
So the terms are that you find such a man.
- Understand?
- Yes.
- Will you undertake it?
- Well...
I must.
All right, you may leave.
One, two, one, two...
Halt! Rope down. Follow me.
Let's go. Faster.
Come here.
Open them again.
Good day.
Please...
That one is such a person.
Open up!
Out! Stand straight!
Leave him. What's your name?
You know it. Varjú.
Of course. Béla. Béla Varjú.
You've had many a beating from me, haven't you?
You're going back to the big yard, understand?
You may thank this man.
- Why? Don't you know him?
- I know him.
- Well? What did I say?
- Thank you.
Not like that, with respect.
Is that enough? If you want, he'll even kiss your hand.
Let's go.
You, too.
Come here.
Take off his shackles.
Go back to your friends.
Get going!
Do you have any friends?
No, nor relatives at a time like this.
I should have kissed your hand, János.
You mean, the bishop's, my son.
You can't imagine what it was like in there.
You can't endure it.
I couldn't have if you hadn't intervened.
I have a lot to thank you for.
How did you get here?
- They caught me.
- Why weren't you careful?
- They caught you, too.
- Did someone squeal?
Maybe.
Was there any evidence against you?
Or any action?
Well?
You're not here for nothing.
What did you do?
Listen... they questioned me a lot and I said nothing.
Why are you inquiring about this?
Do you still remember the old songs, Béla?
Leave me alone.
Stop! Come back from there.
They'll shoot you.
Don't you understand?
Stand over there.
You come with me.
You... and you.
You... and you.
No, you. You come here.
You, too. Hurry up!
Well, let's go.
You're coming with us.
Let's go.
Come here!
Put it down there.
That's right, there.
And you people, put those down there.
And you, too. Over here.
You may go. Move back.
Go on, go on.
Come here.
Women, go further back. Even further.
Stop. Stop!
Shoot in the air. Fire!
- Come back.
- If he doesn't stop, shoot!
Come on, Béla Varjú.
Pick two friends to accompany you.
Ease your conscience, Béla.
Why don't you do it?
Confess. Who did you kill?
- Six people.
- Who? Tell me, who!
- Six people.
- The names. Say the names.
- Köves Kovács, Pista Kis, Kenyér.
- And?
Józsi Kenyér.
More, more!
Tell me about the other two.
Their names. At least say their names.
Józsi Kenyér.
Excuse me, officer.
Stand aside. Step back.
Demote him.
Take him away.
Come on.
Sir, please exonerate me, and save me from the gallows.
Because the man you just executed has killed more people.
When I went with him to the gallows he admitted to six.
Look, János Gajdor... everyone should have the brains to relate the confession of a dead man.
It's your life that we're talking about.
If you could tell me exactly who he killed, then maybe we could find out.
The trouble is he only told me of three.
After that his strength gave out.
Then he started to get really scared.
Well, you see, János Gajdor, that doesn't help you at all.
It's as if you heard nothing.
Just go back.
Go on.
Don't upset yourself.
You must get used to it.
We'll have to be redeemed one day, some way, some other way.
Why don't you speak?
They're impossible, and yet I'd have given them a farm.
They're as hard as nails.
Haven't you tried them out?
They used to let you go.
Three calves and I could go.
The next time, another three.
Now they're hard.
Come on. Let's see our friends.
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Come on. Let's take a walk.
I know you.
That's possible.
You've escorted me.
One escorts many people.
- Aren't you from the lower regions?
- No.
- Are you from Szeged?
- No.
- They say I'm Veszelka.
- Veszelka?
Yes, they say I'm him, that I killed an officer and took his place.
Before, they said he was dead.
Now they say that I'm him.
- Can you understand it?
- No.
If I can't prove I'm not him, they'll hang me.
Yet this Veszelka has killed many.
- At least seven.
- Seven!
I'll be absolved. Seven!
- This man has killed...
- Go to hell!
Come here. Let's go.
Excuse me...
- I know you.
- But I don't.
Get away from here.
- Excuse me...
- Come on.
Stop.
Yes.
Wait outside.
Sir, this convict wants to say something important.
- Go on.
- Excuse me...
- I was told to find...
- Yes, I know.
If you'd allow me to go around and look...
- Now?
- Now.
It should be done now, among the solitary ones.
Take him.
Open the cells.
- Show this man out.
- Have you found Veszelka?
It's not him. Please...
Let's go.
- Please don't hurt me.
- Let's go.
Line up. You too.
Sir, they're assembled.
You stop here.
You go ahead.
So, he's not here. Let's go back.
Stop.
- Don't put the lamps out.
- Yes, sir.
Stand against the wall.
Come here.
We're going back.
Everyone, stand up. In line.
Stand up in line again. Hurry up.
What are you waiting for?
Get back. Hurry up!
Let's go.
- Excuse me...
- Stay there.
You are lmre Veszelka.
You are intelligent and clever.
We're not asking you to find anyone.
We're not asking you for any names.
Just tell us how many of Sándor's men we've caught.
You...
Come with me.
Halt!
Attention!
Turn around!
Five steps forward!
Women stay there.
Stop there.
Excuse me...
You know, Veszelka's killed more people than I have.
Therefore I'm absolved.
And Veszelka has been found.
- Take off his hood.
- Right.
Go over towards that row.
Stop.
Come here.
Help him.
Walk along here.
Know anyone here?
- No.
- Then walk along again.
Put that down.
Go on.
Come here.
- Know anyone now?
- No.
Excuse me! I know someone who belongs to Sándor's gang.
Juli!
Run!
One... two...
Come on.
Sit down.
Hoods off!
Come on.
- Stop it!
- Don't!
Restore order.
Everyone settle down.
Hear me?
Form a square.
Let's go, let's go. Faster.
Move it. Let's go!
Bring that man over here.
Come here.
Which one of them is Sándor?
Sir, he's not here.
Sándor is not at the earthworks.
Had he been here,
I'd have reported it long ago.
Are you certain of that?
It's in my interests.
So you're quite certain he's not at the earthworks?
He's not.
But if you like,
I'll find out where he is.
The girl has died.
You're to find someone who belongs to Sándor's gang. Clear?
- Yes, Sir.
- You help him.
Go to hell!
Excuse me...
I'm frightened. Please protect me.
We'll protect you.
Sit down over there.
Hand out the provisions.
Sir, they usually get it in their cells.
Now they'll get it here.
Over to the wall.
Sit in groups of five.
Come on, hurry up... Sit down.
One... two... three... five...
Come to the front.
Three...
Hurry up.
Go to the front.
Let's go.
You hurry, too.
Sit down.
Escort that man up.
Put him in that one.
In cell number two.
Bring him out.
- They've strangled him.
- That's obvious.
Which two cells did we leave open last night?
- Apart from Gajdor's?
- Of course.
This one... and that one.
You...
- Are you Mihály Lovas Sr?
- Mihály Kabai Lovas.
- Did you leave your cell today?
- No.
No?
Right. Go over there.
- Mihály Kabai Lovas Jr?
- Yes.
- Did you leave your cell?
- No.
No. Right. Come inside.
We left two cell doors open last night.
It was either one or both of you.
Who killed him?
I asked, who killed him?
- Not me.
- Not me.
Right.
Both of you should be hanged.
But we'll only hang one.
One man for another.
Think about who killed János Gajdor.
Come back.
You, too.
Was it you?
- No.
- No.
Right.
So you won't admit it.
What I said will happen.
We'll hang one of you.
Choose.
Is Sándor here?
- No.
- Is Sándor here?
No.
Right. Go inside and think about if he's here or not.
Close the door.
Father, do you know Sándor?
- You know him too.
- I don't.
You do. You've seen him.
You've seen him often.
Is he inside here?
- No.
- Are you certain?
- Yes.
- Come outside.
You stay here.
I'd like to say something, please.
I'll show you who Sándor is, if you will pardon me.
If you pardon both of us.
All right.
If you show me Sándor,
I'll pardon both of you.
- Do you want their hoods off?
- That's not necessary.
Found him?
Show me.
- So, is it him?
- Yes.
He was very brave in '48.
His gang joined Kossuth's with Sándor as captain.
It was reported to him once that two of his gang had attacked a merchant and assaulted his wife.
Sándor summoned the two men.
He waited for them with his pistol loaded.
When the two lads appeared,
Sándor shot them.
Then he shouted loudly,
"That's outlaw's honour!"
They never stole while they were Kossuth's soldiers.
How do you know Sándor?
He came out to the field in '67, he even spoke to me.
He visited us last year.
I served the wine.
I saw him this year, too.
That's not Sándor.
You know it, too.
Sándor is not here.
Take him away.
Come on.
- Go inside.
- Excuse me...
I strangled that man.
Come out.
Repeat it.
- I killed him.
- You're both lying.
You're lying. Both of you.
Both of you should be hanged.
But I stand by what I said.
Only one.
Choose.
- This is the longer one.
- Please...
Please...
I'll tell you who killed him.
- So it wasn't you.
- No, sir.
I just opened the door.
I opened it, waited till he did it, then I went back.
My son didn't leave his cell all night.
All right.
Come and show me who it was.
It's him.
Well?
I killed him.
How?
His son came to my cell during the night.
He opened it, took my place, waited until I'd done it, then he locked me in.
So it wasn't him?
You're all lying.
Take them away.
Stand there.
- The chains.
- Men, the chains.
Turn your backs.
Stand up.
Kabai, stand up. Don't you hear?
Hear that? It's music.
Put it down here.
Put it next to it in a row.
Put that down, too.
Boots, over here.
Company, halt.
Get undressed.
You may rest.
Warden, sir...
- Well?
- I'd like to have a wash.
Hear that, Józsi?
He wants to wash.
What about the rest of you?
That's enough, Torma.
Maybe you'd care to report.
I humbly report... two guards and three prisoners.
Why are you people still here?
There were no other orders.
Everyone must join up.
- But they are hard cases.
- Even the hard cases.
They're part of Sándor's gang.
Even so, everyone must. Let's go.
Let's go.
Wait here.
- I humbly report...
- Bring them here.
- Name?
- Mihály Kabai Lovas Jr.
- Ever been a soldier?
- No.
- And you?
- I was, sir. In '48.
- Where did you serve?
- With the rebels.
- Were you a rebel?
- I was in the cavalry.
Sir, I was also a cavalry rebel.
That's rare.
You still have the skills?
It's not possible to forget, sir.
I've never witnessed it.
Would you show me?
- If you have the horses.
- We do.
- Any choice?
- Yes.
- Saddlery, too?
- Whatever you like. Come on.
Help yourselves.
This one. I don't need a saddle.
Stop! Give that to me.
Stop!
Stop it.
Give it to them.
That was beautiful, my friend.
You're an expert.
Would you form a corps like that?
A cavalry troop?
Yes, but I don't want him in it.
- Are they all from there?
- Yes, the earthworks.
- Everyone here?
- Yes.
- Any sick?
- No.
Go ahead.
Let's go.
Line up at the back.
Come on.
Are they all here?
There are more.
Are they all the former ones?
Yes, they are.
- Are they all alive?
- No.
At the time, many died in Damjanich's army.
And since then, at the earthworks, too.
Imre Veszelka.
But those who are alive... are they all here?
Yes.
Line up according to height.
You, too.
- So, now they're all here.
- Sándor is still missing.
- He won't come, anyway.
- Of course, he will.
- If we asked him, he will.
- No need!
Sir, I humbly report the troops are assembled.
Men... from the Commander-in-Chief...
His Majesty Ferenc József I,
Emperor of Austria, by the grace of God,
Apostolic King of Hungary, pardons Sándor, the leader, in his absence.
Lajos Kossuth sent a message
That his regiment is spent
If he sends that message again
We must all go
Long live Hungarian liberty!
Long live our homeland!
The rest of the troop will get their just punishment.
This land has a name today
and is marked on maps.
But the names and the marks and the land
all had to be won.
Won from nature and from primitive man.
Five generations ago,
a mere 125 years back...
... this land was known
only as the West.
Known only to a handful of white men...
... lonely trappers wandering its vastness
in search of beaver.
They were known as mountain men,
a new breed.
Men like Jim Bridger,
Franchère and Sublette, Linus Rawlings.
More Indian than the Indians
in all but blood.
They held to no law but their own...
... drifted free as the clouds,
settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.
Their mocassined feet and unshod horses
leaving no trace on the land.
Like the Indians,
with whom they were at peace...
... they wanted nothing beyond
what they found, and little of that.
The mountains, the forests,
the harsh country...
... were as unchanging to them
as the stars...
... and just as unyielding.
Far behind the mountains,
beyond the rolling plains...
... they had left the people of the East,
people who were restless in another way.
The kind who'd look at a mountain
and see a watershed...
... look at a forest
and see lumber for houses...
... look at a stony field and see a farm.
Their faces and their instincts
had been turned to the West...
... ever since Plymouth Rock
and Jamestown.
The trapper's road was the trail
of a wolf or the bend of a canyon.
But for whole families
chaffing to follow the sun...
... there had to be broader ways.
There were no roads into the wilderness,
only rivers.
And they flowed in the wrong direction:
North or south.
Or else they stopped at the Alleghenies.
Until one day, a new river took source
in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.
He conceived of a river
that would go west.
And in the way Americans have
of acting out their dreams, it came to be.
The Erie Canal left the Hudson
above Albany...
... and carried clear across
to the Great Lakes.
People who yearned for virgin land
and a new life...
... now had a highway to take them.
And they moved along.
Pride of Utica now loading!
All aboard for the Pride of Utica!
The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...
...the Skoga family!
All eight of them!
All aboard for the Pride of Utica!
Is the laddie's health the reason you're heading west?
Partly.
Only partly.
Mostly our trouble East was rocks.
I had me a farm where some years
I'd raise 100 bushels of rocks to the acre.
Zebulon, you hadn't ought to lie to the man like that.
Wife, I'm a God-fearing soul, and I tell the truth as I see it.
Now, I never used a plow.
I'd blast out the furrows with gunpowder.
And then one morning,
I hauled the bucket up out of the well...
...and so help me, the bucket was full of rocks.
Rocks.
I just stood there right still trying not to blaspheme.
I said to myself,
"You've got a son that's ailing...
...you've got a daughter what won't take to herself a husband."
- There she sits there, mooning as usual.
- Pa.
You've got another who don't seem quite right in the head.
Lilith?
Yes, Pa?
Now, I'll remind you, sir.
I'm still standing there holding a bucket full of rocks...
...and staring into a bleak old age.
So I made me a vow right then and there. I said:
"If I can find a man with $500 who likes rocks...
...then there's gonna be another fool owning this farm."
Well, sir, the Lord provided such a man...
...and here I am.
He ain't told you one word of truth,
Mr. Harvey.
We had the best farm in the township.
Yeah, Rockville Township it was.
Stone County.
Oh, it was not.
It was his itching foot that brought us here.
Heaven knows where we'll end up.
Oh, these are my laddies.
Angus, Brutus and Colin.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
I think they're already acquainted with your daughters.
- Be they single?
- Aye, single so far.
Well, this Illinois country's beginning to sound better to me.
Lilith?
Lilith, here. Strike up a little tune for these handsome lads.
- Oh, I ain't in no mood, Pa.
- Lilith, there's a time for coaxing...
...this ain't the time.
All right.
All right.
A captain bold in Halifax
Who lived in country quarters
Betrayed a maid who hanged herself
One morning in her garters...
Lilith.
Now, you know better than to sing a song like that.
- What ones do you know?
- We know "Yankee Doodle."
- "Yankee Doodle"?
- Their mother's dead.
They haven't had much learning in the social graces.
All right, give them
"A Home in the Meadow."
Eve, come on, you too.
That's it.
Come on, join in.
That's it.
Come on.
Stop.
Loading for the Flying Arrow!
All aboard for the Flying Arrow!
- The Prescott family!
- Here we be. Come on.
Alec Harvey and three sons!
Jeffrey Rose and family!
But the canal was only the first step
toward the promised land.
The next steps were longer and harder.
Those who could raise the fare
went by steamboat to the end of the line.
Others found a cheaper way
to head for Ohio, Illinois...
... and the open spaces beyond.
Lilith. Lilith, listen to this:
"Theirs was a poignant parting in the forest.
The handsome young backwoodsman carved two hearts on a tree trunk...
...then from ten paces, hurled a knife at the junction of the two hearts."
Junction. What's that?
Well, that's where the two hearts meet.
Now, listen:
"His marksmanship was uncanny.
Three times he hurled the knife on target.
'That was for luck,, he said the first time.
'That was for love. Deep, divine love" he said the second.
And the third time, 'That was a prayer, a plea for love undying."'
Isn't that beautiful?
I reckon. If anybody ever talks like that.
Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.
There ain't no sense to you, Eve.
You wanna to be a farm wife, but you don't wanna marry a farmer.
Neither do you.
Of course not.
I don't wanna have nothing to do with farms.
I want silk dresses and fine carriages and a man to smell good.
What I want's back East, not West.
But I'll get there yet. You watch.
You don't know what you want yet.
It's the man that counts, not where he lives.
- Ready, now?
Ready.
Daddy, Daddy, something coming upriver.
Hostile Indians, I suspect.
- Could it be river pirates, Zebulon?
- Don't know.
They say no honest man travels this river at night.
I can only see one man, Pa.
I hear that's a favorite pirate trick.
They hide in the bottom of the boat...
...till they're ready to jump you.
- Get my gun, Colin.
- All right, Pa.
Just come in slow and easy, stranger.
And keep your hands where we can see them.
Name's Linus Rawlings.
I'm hungrier than sin and real peaceful like.
- What have you got in the craft?
- Beaver pelts.
I said beaver pelts.
I never had a chance to see a beaver pelt,
Mr. Rawlings.
Well, in that case, ma'am,
I'll show you one.
There you are.
That's real soft.
It's a fine pelt, ma'am.
Now, my apologies, sir.
- We was afeared you might be a pirate.
- I ain't no pirate.
Come on, let's have supper and get acquainted.
No, no, no. That's yours.
Keep that, ma'am.
Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.
Is he the backwoodsman you've been waiting for?
More than likely he's got a wife and six kids waiting for him.
Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.
You've only had four plates.
I was beginning to think you didn't like it.
Well, it don't pay to eat too much on an empty stomach, ma'am.
How come you're to be traveling so late at night?
Well, I'm kind of anxious to get to Pittsburgh.
I ain't seen a city for a long time.
I aim to whoop it up a little.
Well, now, we've never seen a mountain man before.
Tell me, them Rocky Mountains as high as they say?
Well, now, I just don't rightly know.
I never climbed one. I've...
Uh...
Well, you know, that just ain't exactly true.
Jim Bridger and me...
...we started up one of them little-bitty
Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.
And then, one day, we see this fella...
...and he has a great big pair of white wings...
...and a harp in his hand.
And I said to Jim...
...I said, "Jim, I don't like the way that fella's looking at us."
And Jim said he didn't care too much for it neither...
...so we both skedaddled down out of there...
...and to this day I ain't never had a good look at the Rocky Mountains.
- Well, I remember one time...
- Zebulon.
- What?
- One liar at a time is enough.
Well, then, I reckon it's about bedtime.
Gotta get an early start in the morning.
We'll be expecting you for breakfast.
Oh, well, that's mighty hospitable,
Mr. Prescott...
...but sometimes I wake up and get the urge to move.
I might be long gone by sunup, but thank you.
- I wanna thank all of you. Good night.
- Good night.
- Strange fellas, these mountain men.
- Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.
- By golly, that looks like my blanket.
- It is.
Well, then, I'm a mite confused, ma'am.
Whose bed would it be?
Yours.
I ain't ever saw a bed like that since last time I come east.
Why'd you do it?
Ain't polite to ask a girl why she done something for a man.
No. Well, I reckon my manners ain't much at that.
Anyway, I sure thank you.
Good night, ma'am.
Are them Indian girls pretty?
Well, now, I reckon that all depends on just how long a man has gone...
...without seeing one.
How long's it been since you seen a white girl?
I ain't quite sure why you asked that.
How pretty do I look to you?
But, ma'am...
...ain't you just being a little bit forward?
Well, you're headed upriver and I'm headed down.
There's no time to get these questions answered.
You dead sure you want them answered?
Yes.
Glory be.
Ma'am, it seems like you've been kissed before.
I've never been kissed permanent before.
By golly, you sure use surprising words.
I never heard "permanent" mixed up with a thing like a kiss before.
I can still feel that kiss.
- Can you?
- Well, you said something before...
...that we had not forget:
I'm heading upstream and you're headed downstream.
Lovers have parted before and come together again.
- Ma'am.
- Eve.
Eve, I'm a sinful man.
Deep, dark, sinful.
I'm on my way to Pittsburgh to be sinful again.
Likely I'll stay drunk for a month.
I won't even remember the fancy gals I dally with...
...or the men I carve up just out of pure cussedness...
...any more than I'll remember you.
Linus, I'm asking you.
Can you still feel that kiss?
Eve...
Eve, you make me feel like a man standing on a narrow ledge...
...coming face-to-face with a grizzly bear.
There just ain't no ignoring the situation.
Eve!
Eve!
- Eve! Where is she?
- Zeb, what's the matter?
Anyways, you're here.
I thought you'd gone with him.
- Gone?
- Yes, gone.
I knowed you were setting with him...
...but I kept telling myself,
"At least she's looking at a man."
Even a wisp of smoke like that is better than...
Are you crying? Crying for him?
Now, what does that mean?
Now, tell me what that means.
Nothing, Pa.
What time did you come to bed?
It was early, Pa.
It wasn't. It was late.
Daughter, I'm only gonna ask you once.
Is there anything for your ma and pa to worry about?
No, Pa, there ain't.
He'll be back.
I'll see him again.
But you expected to see him this morning.
You know you did.
I don't care. I'll see him again.
Look.
- You got a growed man to do that?
- I did. Just like in the book.
Did you get him to say them crazy words?
I told you before, it ain't the words, it's the sentiment.
You mean, he didn't even giggle nor nothing at such foolishness?
He said it was a real solemn occasion.
Like shooting the rapids without a paddle.
No matter what he said, he did it just to get rid of you so as he could clear out.
You know that's so.
And you're lucky he did. Do you wanna live like a squaw all your life?
Go on, say anything you like...
...but I'll see him again. I know I will.
And he ain't got a wife and six kids.
He ain't got a wife at all yet.
Hey, Pierre!
Someone's coming upriver.
Customer.
Trapper, seems like.
See how that cover bellies up?
Could be furs.
Thirsty, mister?
Drier than a grasshopper on a hot griddle.
Well, welcome to our little inn, sir.
My name is Jeb Hawkins, late colonel of the Alabama militia.
- Where you bound for?
- Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh? Well.
Looks like he's got a whole canoe of furs, Pop.
- Sure enough mountain man.
- Indeed.
One of our explorers gonna extend our domain to the far shores of the Pacific.
Well, nothing but the finest for you, sir.
Whiskey?
- Right.
- No pepper or rattlesnake heads in this.
Nothing but the pure grain and the sweet kiss of the malt.
- Never mind the cup, I'll just take the jug.
- Oh, a real mountain man, huh?
- I trust you'll toast our noble banner, sir.
- Sure will.
Golly, you're right.
That's real sipping liquor.
Pa, him being a trapper, you suppose he might know what that varmint is we got?
Well, say, now, he might.
Yes, sir, he just might.
Sir, we caught us a cave-dwelling critter...
...that no man in these parts has seen before.
You know, it'd be right satisfying to having you tell us what it is.
Well, I don't know too much about cave-dwelling varmints.
Just yonder. Take your jug.
Well, I...
I don't know.
WOIt's right over here.
You know any sweet-talking gals in Pittsburgh?
No, no. Nary a one, yet.
Well, Pop and I are hoping we'll vacation there.
I'll be at the Duquesne House if it ain't burned down.
Hey, there, now, you pretty girl, you sure you got a varmint in here?
Now, you...
WODo you hear him?
Huh?
WOHe breathes loud and fierce.
- We keep him in this hole just yonder.
You keep him in there?
You gotta look a little closer.
Well, he seen the varmint, Pa.
- Well done, daughter.
- I ain't so sure.
He was hard muscled. I could feel the blade just skitter along his ribs.
Oh, you just need more practice, that's all.
It's a pity you ain't got the knack your ma had.
Lord rest her soul.
All right, men, lay it on, men.
Come on, come on.
We got more fish to fry.
Down to the island.
Tell Pa them settlers, rafts are coming.
Can't I have this toilet water, Pa?
- Genuine Parisian accent, it says.
- How much is it?
It's only 15 cents.
Fifteen cents? Put it back.
You're right, sir. Absolutely right.
You save the pennies and dollars will grow.
Likely you've growed many a dollar.
Mr. Bedloe, all my life I've been striving to avoid becoming a millionaire.
I think I've succeeded right well.
I've got a little put away in the sock.
It'll stay there.
Well, now, them's my sentiments exactly.
Now, you, sir.
You look like a man of property.
Now, if I was to bet, I'd say you was worth, say, a thousand dollars.
- Pretty close to the mark?
- Well, close, maybe.
Colin, how much powder we got left?
- Don't be afraid, now, don't be afraid.
Now, there's women and children here.
You gents wouldn't want us to have to start shooting, now, would you?
Be of good cheer, folks.
It's in our noble tradition that we conquer the wilderness...
...with nothing but our bare hands and stout hearts.
You can build new rafts and sally forth in the spirit of your forefathers.
Why, you pious old scoundrel.
I'll see you burn.
Americans can't be whipped.
It's him.
I knew he'd come back. It's him.
Now let us pray.
O Lord...
...we thank thee for our salvation.
We commit the souls of our dead to thy gentle keeping.
We pray for a speedy recovery of our wounded.
And now another matter.
O Lord...
...without consulting with thee...
...we have sent thy way some souls whose evil ways passeth all understanding.
We ask thee humbly to receive them.
Whether you want them or not.
Amen.
Now, it'll be a job...
...but I guess I can patch her up good enough to get to Pittsburgh.
- Linus.
- Now, Eve...
...let's just not talk any more about it.
Linus, I'm telling you, you don't know your own mind.
Well, maybe so, maybe not.
You know, I ain't saying that you haven't been on my mind some.
I ain't saying that.
But I still went to see the varmint with that pirate girl.
I'll always be going to see the varmint, Eve.
I just ain't cut out to be a farmer or a husband.
Linus, I ain't never bringing up the subject again...
...whether ever I see you or not.
No, it's for the best.
I wish you Godspeed, Eve.
And I ain't said that to anybody for a long time.
I can see rapids ahead, Pa. White water.
Look. Look.
Oh, we must've taken the wrong fork.
Let's beach her on this side.
Harvey!
Rapids!
Rapids ahead! Beach her!
Beach her!
Hold her steady.
Rein!
Pa, we're in the current!
Get inside, Zeke.
No, I don't wanna.
Straighten her, Pa.
Lilith!
Hold it steady!
I can't!
Go on. Go on to help Pa.
I'll get it.
Lilith! Lilith!
Lie down!
Lie down!
What happened?
They took the wrong fork of the river and they went over the falls.
Did you happen to hear the name of the family?
Uh... Prescott, I think.
Something like that.
As soon as they're buried decent...
...I'm heading back East on the first boat that comes along.
And if you were in your right mind, you would too.
Oh, Linus.
Would you walk with me a piece, Eve?
Eve, I...
Eve, all the time I was paddling down here
I was thinking...
...if I found you alive, I'd...
Would you come to Pittsburgh with me, Eve?
Oh, Linus.
I'm staying right here.
I ain't moving a foot one way or the other.
Now, would you explain that a little?
Ma and Pa, they wanted a farm in the West...
...and this is as far as they got.
Seems to me this is where the Lord wanted the farm to be.
But your brother, Sam, he's bad hurt, and winter's coming...
There's no sense talking about it.
I'm gonna do it.
Eve, you just ain't making much sense.
Well, half the people that come West don't make much sense, I reckon.
All right.
All right.
By golly, you're a strong-minded woman.
I reckon I seen that varmint for the last time.
The westward course was no smoother
than that of true love.
Not only the hard hand of nature
was against it, but the impediment of war.
Trouble over land
smoldered along the Mexican border.
Not all Americans were for war, including
Congressman Abe Lincoln of Illinois.
But a war did break out,
and in the end...
... vast new territories came into the Union
along with their rich Spanish names:
Rio Grande, Santa Fe,
Albuquerque, El Paso.
And most glittering of all, California...
... named after a mythical island
of pearls and gold in a 15th-century novel.
Here, in 1848...
... at Sutter's Mill, a man found something
he wasn't even looking for...
... at the bottom of a ditch.
And the cry of his discovery was heard
clear across the continent...
... in Boston, New York, Savannah...
... and across the oceans
in London, Paris, Berlin.
But nowhere was the clamor of gold
heard more eagerly than in St. Louis...
... the busiest fur-trading center
in the world...
... and the noisiest, bawdiest,
most uppity town west of New York.
I say there's no more than three.
- Six.
- Six?
It's that lace that fooled you. I say three.
Watch him. I hear Cleve's an expert on petticoats. Anyway, you can never prove it.
We're going to be late for that poker game.
Look, I've just stuck you for the most expensive dinner in St. Louis.
I don't mind sticking you a bit deeper.
I'll lay you a hundred it's no less than six.
- How will you prove it?
- Go backstage and find out.
- If I go back and check with you.
- Fair enough.
Second girl.
- Miss Prescott? Miss Prescott?
- Later.
It's rather important.
It's always important.
The older they are, the more important it gets.
Miss Prescott, please.
I am Hylan Seabury...
...attorney in the matter of Jonathan Brooks.
He means nothing to you?
That old goat?
Well, you must've meant something to him, Miss Prescott.
- Why?
- You're included in his will.
Of course, you have to make the trip to California to claim the bequest.
Well, now, I wouldn't go to California...
...if John Jacob Astor left me
San Francisco.
I don't think Mr. Astor had holdings there, no.
However, the yield from
Mr. Brooks, property is not to be scorned.
- Yield of what?
- Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.
- Gold?
- Precisely.
You own a gold mine, Miss Prescott.
It yielded $3500 the very first week.
Gold mine?
Well. Well, I...
That sweet old goat.
For heavens...
Well.
This is an unexpected pleasure.
- Where's the money?
- Money?
Money?
Oh, yes. You're referring, of course, to our little agreement.
One hundred to start you off...
...and my share of the winnings.
Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to report that the hundred no longer exists.
That $100, I assure you...
...will turn out to be the best investment you have ever made.
I have plans, gentlemen...
...beyond your wildest dreams.
I'm gonna earn you a piece of a gold mine.
Gold mine.
You ain't gonna earn nothing.
You ain't gonna be nothing, you ain't gonna do nothing...
...unless we get that 100 back by the morning.
Grimes, you don't mean that.
- You're gonna kill off the golden goose.
- Call it what you want, mister.
We'll be waiting.
Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off
point for emigrants from everywhere.
Solid, God-fearing families
bound for the farmlands of Oregon...
... and get-rich-quick adventurers
racing for the gold of California.
Try it.
- You got a wagon, I suppose?
- I can get one.
And a team to pull it?
I can get everything I need.
- You got a husband?
- I'm single, Mr. Morgan.
No traveling companion?
- No, I'm traveling alone.
- Not on my wagon train.
Alone and single brings out the deviltry in a man.
Gets them all worked up and they're wild enough already.
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.
Oh, woman of your sort?
One day you'd find yourself in trouble, and there'd be hell to pay just figuring out who.
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?
Well, now, ain't you the feisty one.
I like spirit in a woman.
Hey, you got a pretty face under that powder too.
And a fine, sturdy body under them clothes, I wager.
There's a woman named Clegg,
Aggie Clegg.
Why don't you go see her?
Thanks.
I told you, no.
I was hoping to make this trip with a husband.
Nearly got one last week.
Look, I hear there's 40 men to every woman in California.
- Miss Clegg, I'd be willing to pay you.
- I don't need money.
I need a man.
Any man.
Morning, ladies.
Beautiful morning.
Would you, by any chance, happen to be Miss Lily Prescott?
Not unless you got a big imagination.
Then you must be the lady in question.
Cleve Van Valen, Miss Prescott, at your service.
At your every command from here to California.
Well, thank you.
But whatever you're offering,
I don't need.
Perhaps you don't understand.
Yes, I do.
I know a tinhorn when I see one.
Miss Prescott.
I'm offering you an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.
Goodbye, Mr. Van Valen. Goodbye.
Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you,
Miss Clegg.
May I say I have never seen a woman with more beautiful hair.
What a prize catch it'll make...
...hanging from the waist of an Indian.
Beauty alone in the wilderness, and who's to protect you?
No one.
Not one person won't be looking after himself.
Well...
Good day, ladies. Good day.
Nobody ever said that to me before.
What?
That I had such... Such beautiful hair.
You know something?
I got a hunch you're gonna draw men like fish to the bait.
Maybe I can catch one of them while they swim by.
You got yourself a partner.
Thank you.
How's it, men?
It's all clear through here. Look for a little mudhole up through the next pocket.
How far?
Oh, maybe half a quarter.
Well, thanks.
Looks a little higher up on that ridge.
There's a water hole up there about half a mile. Let's head for it.
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.
Hey, you're driving.
I was raised on a farm.
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.
Hey, Aggie?
- Can you use these?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Ladies.
At your service.
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.
Well, I just couldn't bear to think of you two making this trip without my help.
If I was to hear later on that something happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.
You came 100 miles alone?
Well, I had no way of counting the miles,
Mr. Morgan, but I'll take your word for it.
Well, you've got another 100, mister.
Going back.
I told you, when a wagon breaks down,
I want men who can fix it...
...not bet how long it'll take.
You don't mean you'll turn me out?
Pass me adrift at the mercy of savage Indians?
If you don't get moving,
I'll cast you adrift...
Uh-uh-uh.
I appeal to your sporting instinct, sir.
I'm prepared to wager you that I stay with this train.
- Well, you got a wager.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
The fact is, I hired this man.
We'll put up his stake.
Is that right, Miss Prescott?
If Miss Clegg says so.
Ma'am...
...I'll be forever grateful.
Now, I'll unpack my gear.
Agatha, have you gone crazy?
He says he's a man wanting to do an honest day's work.
And he'll do it. I can promise you that.
Hey, you men on that last wagon, keep up that slack.
Keep it up.
Get that team moving.
Keep them moving there.
Don't let those lines sag.
Keep them up. Keep them up.
Keep those teams moving.
Keep them moving.
Don't let those lines sag.
You, on that middle team, keep them moving.
Get in there.
Over here, Pa.
Get in there.
Get in there. Get in there, mule.
I'm just overwhelmed by all this attention,
Miss Prescott.
I want to confess...
...I have lied about why I wanted to work for you.
I know.
The real reason is, of course, that I'm in love with you.
No.
It's the truth.
From the first moment I saw you,
I've known that I couldn't live without you.
Well, I'd hate to be the cause of your death, Mr. Van Valen.
I don't speak lightly, Miss Prescott.
I'm prepared to assume the responsibilities of a faithful husband.
Oh, and are you ready to assume the responsibilities...
...of my property too, Mr. Van Valen?
Really?
What kind of property?
Gold, Mr. Van Valen.
Gold by the ton, from what I understand.
Bright, yellow, shiny gold.
Why, I had no idea.
- I'm sure you hadn't.
- Miss Prescott, I really mean...
Here comes Agatha.
If you must propose to somebody...
...I suggest you get on your knees to her.
Besides, she has beautiful hair.
Look at them.
Think they was getting ready to bury somebody.
Ain't we worn down enough as it is?
Well, let's wake them up.
Listen, everybody.
That's the spirit! That's the way to feel!
Oh, hiya, Mr. Morgan!
Aggie. For lunch.
Thanks. Nice nest of fish.
What is it, Mr. Morgan?
Miss Prescott, I've been thinking.
Oh?
Wet or dry, you're the handsomest woman
I ever did see.
Spirit and a fine, sturdy body.
It's a noble combination, Miss Prescott.
Why, for you, childbearing would come as easy as rolling off a log.
Well, I think I'd rather roll off a log,
Mr. Morgan.
Ma'am, I'm telling you, you got the build for it.
I want you for my wife.
I've got a cattle ranch just below the Merced.
I'll be settling down there, fit and proper.
I'm sure you're very fit and proper,
Mr. Morgan.
Well, then...
...you just couldn't do no better than marrying me.
Why, we'd have ourselves a fine family in no time at all.
I believe that.
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan...
...but I can't accept your proposal.
Why not?
Well, a woman likes to hear something a little more inviting.
Well, ain't that what I've been doing?
Inviting you?
Inviting you to share my life,
Miss Prescott.
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.
It's something else, ain't it?
Must be something else nagging at you.
Well...
...I don't aim to let it stop me,
Miss Prescott.
You can count on that.
What did he want?
Children.
Children?
Well, I'll be...
Why didn't he come shopping at the right store?
- I'll take a look.
- Well.
Now, gentlemen, are we pikers?
I'm gonna see and I'm gonna raise this fine pistol...
...London-made and loaded for bear.
I'll take part of that bet.
I told you I wouldn't stand for you fleecing any...
Cheyennes.
There's too many to fight.
We'll have to run for it.
You can't outrun them with wagons.
The minute you get moving, cut your teams loose.
- Have you gone crazy?
- Go on, get moving.
Chances are they want our stock more than us.
Now, you're a gambler, ain't you?
All right, let's get moving.
Keep them closed up there.
I don't know how to unhook them.
Cleve, watch out!
Cleve!
Joe, pick me up.
We'll be moving at daybreak.
I'll take a few men, see if we can find him.
Give him a decent, Christian burial.
Someone's coming! Someone's coming!
Well, I can let you have this rig for a dollar a day, and I'll give you a good team.
- Pick it up in the morning.
- That'll be fine.
Could you tell me the way to the Brooks claim?
Well, the claims are down by the river.
- Which road should I take?
- Only one road. Along the river.
- Thank you.
- Sure welcome.
We're looking for a Mr. Huggins.
You found him.
This is Miss Lilith Prescott.
I figured.
They told me you was a real looker.
Yup. It's all here for you.
Just the way Mr. Brooks staked it out.
Must've had 20 men working on it.
Well, where are they now?
Who's digging the gold?
Gold? I ain't never seen a better grade since I come here with Millie.
It was just a pocket, though.
The whole shebang, nothing but a pocket.
Oh, we cleared 4200 before it played out.
Now, about that 4200...
Mr. Brooks, he spent three before his heart give out.
I put up 600 for a brass-handled casket.
I figure the rest you owe me for sitting on your claim.
Oh, miss, I mean, that's only fair, ain't it?
I mean, wouldn't you...?
Funny pair, all right.
How about you boys?
Come and see the brand-new attraction.
It's exciting and sensational.
Step right in, gentlemen.
Miss Prescott?
Hello, Mr. Morgan.
I'd invite you in, but it's a little cramped.
This is no life for a fine woman like you.
I heard your mine was played out.
But where's your fancy friend?
Cleve?
Last I heard, he was in Hangtown.
You mean that no-good went off and left you?
He went off and left me.
But I don't agree that he's no good.
Cleve is Cleve, that's all.
You're a perplexing woman,
Miss Prescott.
When a skunk needs killing...
...well, it ain't enough just to say a skunk's a skunk.
Mr. Morgan...
...all my life I've wanted to marry a rich husband.
Can I blame Cleve for wanting to marry a rich wife?
Both of us may have been born for the poorhouse...
...but we're not the kind to like it.
Do you believe all this you've been saying, or is it just words?
Now, tell me the truth.
The truth is...
...Cleve and I couldn't live alone just on love.
Not for five minutes.
Then you've answered the question I've been asking for better than 2000 miles.
I got the biggest ranch you ever did see.
You can't ride across it in a day.
That land's gonna mean money sooner than you think.
You want a rich husband...
...you're looking at him.
There ain't a blessed thing you have to do except mind the kids.
I'm sorry.
Not now.
Not ever.
What a waste.
Someone put together like you.
Aggie.
Those who struck it rich wanted
all the pleasures that money could buy.
And there were plenty to sell to them.
Even the Sacramento riverboats
took on luxury goods.
I'll see it.
It's up to you.
Betting?
What's the matter with you?
- I'm checking out.
- Checking out?
What's the matter with him?
Lily, I got to talk to you.
I found myself throwing in a winning hand.
Well, I just never thought
I'd do that for any girl.
Lily.
How'd you like to hook up with a no-good gambler?
Oh, hon, we are on our way.
I got $1200 right here.
- What'll we do, open a gambling house?
- No.
A married man should spend his evenings at home.
Then we'll open a music hall in San Francisco.
- No.
- I can still sing and dance.
No. A married woman should spend her evenings at home.
- But we can't sit at home on $1200 for...
- Lily.
Have you seen San Francisco?
It's ugly, and it's small, and it's full of fleas.
And it burns down about every five minutes...
...but each time they keep on rebuilding it a little bigger and better than before.
It's alive and kicking and nothing can stop it.
And it makes you wanna build something too.
A railroad.
A steamship line.
Something to help the baby grow.
Cleve, on $1200?
We could start out with a wagon or a rowboat.
With the help of the devil,
I'll bet we make it.
Young America was not only
a union of East and West.
There were North and South too.
And between them,
the bonds were weakening.
Mr. Lincoln, now retired
from Congress and practicing law...
... realized that the South would fight...
... to mold the new and
uncommitted territories to its own image.
Still two years from the presidency...
... he pleaded that the free West
be allowed to remain free...
... and warned of the hazards
of a house divided against itself.
But the South,
seeing its power and influence wane...
... struggled against the inevitable
in dozens of Western towns.
And slowly, the bitter seeds of civil war
took root.
Howdy, Ms. Rawlings.
Whoa, Rosebud, whoa.
Say, Mr. Peterson, what's that suit you got on?
Uniform, Mrs. Rawlings. A uniform.
Our militia company was sworn in...
...and I'm Corporal Peterson now,
Ohio Volunteers.
You won't be seeing me for a spell.
Hey, I got a letter for you, from way out in California.
It must be from my sister, Lilith.
"Dear Eve..."
Mr. Peterson, could you wait a minute?
I wanna answer this right away.
Zeb?
Zeb, come on down here.
Well, we was hoping that Zeb might be going with us.
His pa went when the first bugle blew.
Ain't one enough?
Hi, corporal.
Jeremiah, get Mr. Peterson some buttermilk.
Buttermilk.
It's from your aunt Lilith.
She says there ain't no war out in California and they don't expect there'll be one.
"Business is brisk.
Many opportunities for an energetic young man."
There's talk of building a railroad east.
"Cleve has hopes of getting in on the ground floor.
We would welcome Zeb if he wants to come."
Ma, did you write her about me?
- Not exactly.
- Now, did you?
I told her you didn't like farming any better than your pa did.
Ma, you got the wrong idea about this war.
It ain't gonna be so bad, is it, corporal?
You know Pa's having the time of his life.
Now, Ms. Rawlings,
I got it from the captain himself...
...that we ain't gonna be gone no time at all.
Pa left it up to you whether I go or not.
But you know what he really felt.
Ms. Rawlings, there ain't much glory in tromping behind a plow.
Reckon there's no hurry in answering this letter.
Thank you for waiting.
You mean I can go?
Oh, there'll be things to do.
Ma...
Gotta get your underwear washed and your socks darned.
Do they give you one of them suits?
One of them uniforms?
I reckon.
Might not give you no shirts, though.
Take that one off, I'll wash it for you.
I got the others washed, they aren't ironed yet.
Mother, I...
Why'd you call me that?
It's always been "Ma" before.
I don't know.
All of a sudden...
..."Ma" didn't seem enough somehow.
Hey, cowpoke!
Go on back, dog!
Go on!
What could I do, Pa?
He's Linus, boy.
Always was more Linus, blood.
I guess that's why I love him so much.
But you've gotta help me pray, Pa.
Help me pray.
Ohio.
Battery B, Ohio!
- Let's go!
On the double, come on!
Anybody here from the 12th Michigan?
Thirty-sixth Indiana.
Evening of April 6th, 1862.
The guns that had roared all day
fell silent...
... around a little church
called the Shiloh Meeting House.
Many a man had met his God
that Sunday...
... but not in church.
You wasted your time, men. He's dead.
- But, doc, this here is Captain Rawlings.
- Captain Linus Rawlings.
- Take him out.
- Keep moving, men.
- Why can't you look where you're going?
- I'm sorry, soldier.
Watch it.
Saw. Brandy.
Chloroform.
Get it all down. Come on, all of it.
Come on, we're just in the way here.
It had been the bloodiest day
of the war on the Western front.
In the morning, it had looked like
a Confederate victory, but by nightfall...
... no man cared to use
the words "win" or "lose."
After Shiloh...
... the South never smiled.
- You tasted that water yet?
- No.
Well, try it.
- Tastes funny, huh?
- Yeah.
I seen it before sundown. It was pink.
Pinker than sassafras tea.
You mean...?
It don't seem fitting a man should have to drink water like that.
Don't seem fitting a man should have to do any of the things we've done today.
Did you kill anybody?
I don't think so.
I got knocked dizzy right off.
And when I come to, found my rifle, it was busted.
And then some more soldiers come along and tried to stick me in the arm.
All the rest is mixed up after that.
Well, I ain't killed nobody, neither.
And I don't want to.
- Hey, where you from?
- Ohio.
This fool war started in the East.
What's us Westerners doing in it?
I don't rightly know anymore.
It ain't quite what I expected.
There ain't much glory looking at a man with his guts hanging out.
- Where are you from?
- Texas.
Say...
You ain't a Reb, are you?
Well, I was this morning.
Tonight, I ain't so sure.
Seems like I ought to be shooting you.
Well, you got anything to shoot with?
No.
All I got's this bayonet.
I got a pistol.
I took it off a dead officer.
Hey, why don't we skedaddle out of here?
- You mean desert?
- I mean, why don't...?
Just leave this here war to the folks who'd want it.
They say there ain't no war out in California.
Get that battery over here.
Stragglers, join your regiment.
Stragglers. Hey, you!
I'm planning to move Rousseau's brigade into this area.
Hidden battery, placed well before dawn.
Do you approve?
I'll approve any dispositions you wanna make.
If you hadn't held the flank today, we'd have been whipped for fair.
Sherman, let's sit down a minute.
There's something I wanna say to you.
Lantern.
You may find yourself in command here.
Why?
I've seen some of the dispatches the newspaper correspondents have filed today.
They're saying
I was taken by surprise this morning.
You weren't taken by surprise.
I was.
No matter.
They're saying...
...I was drunk again last night.
Were you?
No.
But you can't fight front and rear.
Win or lose, tomorrow...
...I intend to resign.
Because of the newspapers?
Because of a general lack of confidence in me.
Oh, don't you think
I've ever felt like that?
A month ago they were saying
I was crazy. Insane.
Now they're calling me a hero.
A hero or crazy, I'm the same man.
It doesn't matter what the people think.
It's what you think, Grant.
You mean that's Grant?
I reckon.
General Grant.
You know this war's gonna be won in the West, and how to win it.
Everything you've done proves it.
And I say that a man has the right to resign only if he's wrong.
Not if he's right.
I guess I never thought of it that way.
I'll think it over.
What is there to think about?
The Army's better off with you than without you. That's the test.
All right.
Thanks.
There's a lot to do before morning, Sherman.
What are you doing?
Why did you make me do that?
Fire.
Hey, Zeb!
Didn't you get my letter?
I wrote more than four months ago.
She never was...
...quite the same after she got the news about Pa.
I don't think she minded going,
Zeb, except...
...she wanted to see you again.
Of course Pa ain't really there.
I put up a stone anyway.
Well...
...better be on my way.
Way? Where?
I need you, Zeb.
Only one thing brought me back.
She's...
Well, this farm is half yours.
I was thinking we'd finally clear away that patch of woods down by the river and...
You're twice the farmer I am.
You don't need me.
Farm's all yours. It's only fair.
Sure don't feel right about this.
What are you gonna do?
I haven't mustered out yet.
I can still transfer to the regulars.
Cavalry, maybe. Go west.
Have to fight Indians?
You sure are hard to make out, Zeb.
Now, what do you wanna do that for?
Do you like fighting?
You remember the story Pa used to tell us about fighting that grizzly bear?
Yeah.
And I asked him, I said,
"Well, why'd you get in such a fix?
Do you like fighting grizzlies?"
He said:
"Well, uh, not especially. Uh...
I just wanted to go somewhere and the bear was there first."
Well, I...
I guess I just wanna go somewhere too.
- So long.
- So long, Zeb.
Even while North and South
were being torn apart...
... East and West had been
drawn together by the Pony Express...
... the most daring mail route in history.
Eighty riders were in the saddle
at all times, night and day, in all weather.
Half of them riding east,
half riding west...
... between Missouri and Sacramento...
... carrying mail across country
in days instead of months.
Unarmed, they rode to save weight.
Five dollars a letter, the mail cost,
and on thin paper too.
It was courage, skill and speed...
... against hostile Indians, bandits,
hell and occasional high water.
Even as they rode,
men were already building...
... a faster message carrier across
the country: The Overland Telegraph.
And the Indians found
a new amusement...
... listening to the level tune
of the singing wires.
But far less amusing to the Indians...
... was the coming of the steel roadway
of the iron horse.
The surveyors, route lay through immense
natural barriers, the Rocky Mountains...
... and the equally discouraging
High Sierras.
But range upon range could never stop
the titanic contest...
... between two corporate giants
racing to put down...
... the greatest mileage of track
before they met.
The Central Pacific eastward
from Sacramento through the Sierras.
And the Union Pacific,
forging westward across the plains...
... with the Rockies still to come.
The prize in the race was free land,
vast parcels for every mile of track laid.
Land that would one day
be worth millions.
Hold it.
Set it down.
Workers, up.
Where'd you find them?
About a mile back yonder.
That's Johnny Hormatz.
That's Jack Perkin.
What the hell is this? A picnic?
- Well, the Indians got a couple of our men...
- Mister, you were the foreman here.
Now you're a tracklayer.
Now get back to work, all of you!
Move it!
Fast!
- You.
- Yes, sir.
You're the foreman till I can find somebody better.
- Yes, sir.
- Get them at it.
- Wait a minute.
- Move it!
Your name Jethro Stuart?
All right, get at it.
Well, Mr. Jethro Stuart, you're hired to hunt buffalo to feed these men...
...not to stop their work.
Why'd you bring these bodies here?
They're railroaders. I thought somebody in the railroad might be interested.
I'm the railroad and I'm not interested.
You should've buried them, then tracked down the Indians who did it.
Well, Mr. King, like you said,
I was hired to hunt...
...not to dig graves or fight Indians.
Those fellas are mostly old soldiers.
You wouldn't think a couple dead men bother them much.
I don't want anything in their thick skulls but their work. Do you understand?
Now, get rid of those bodies.
Start tracking those Indians.
You keep forgetting, Mr. King, my job's buffalo.
It was buffalo.
Go to the paymaster and draw your time.
Well, now, that foreman fella, you didn't fire him.
You just took him down a peg because you needed him.
Who's gonna shoot buffalo? You?
- What the devil is that?
- Milk.
Milk?
The Army must've changed since I was in it.
- Just rode in. I'm hungry.
- You are, huh?
But you'd rather watch them than eat.
- Is that it?
- That's it.
Well, I wish you were as eager to protect this railroad.
Did you get any word about those two men who were killed today?
I tracked the Arapahos and talked to the chief.
Those men were a mile off the right-of-way...
...where they had no business, drunk and chasing squaws.
- As much their fault as it was the Indians'.
- That a fact?
Well, soldier boy, your job is to fight Indians, not to agree with them.
Mr. King, there were 200 Arapahos and I had 20 men.
Now, to me...
...agreeing seemed wiser than fighting.
To you, huh?
Well, you know, I might just send off a wire to the colonel.
He may not agree.
I already reported. He does agree.
Acknowledged and understood. Sergeant.
Trouble, sir?
I don't know.
Hey, lieutenant.
I got a message:
Indians are up to something.
You know anything about it?
Chief says railroad busted the agreement.
Changed the route, come smack through Arapaho hunting grounds.
- You sure the chief's right?
- Plenty sure.
They're getting the war paint ready.
Can you stand there and tell me...
...that one little change is gonna cost the Arapahos one buffalo.
- Or even one jackrabbit?
- Mr. King.
They can be made to see it differently.
Who's hurting them?
What's a railroad anyway?
Two tracks and a whistle.
It's not the tracks they're afraid of.
It's what the tracks bring.
The buffalo hunters slaughtering off their herds.
And then the settlers coming in.
And when will that be?
Twenty, 30 years, maybe?
By then, we'll all be dead.
Right now we're just crossing the land.
That's all. Land that's safe to the Arapahos for our lifetime.
Now, you go talk to them.
Smoke a peace pipe with them.
Do anything they want.
Just get them to make a new agreement.
That's your job, isn't it?
Keeping the peace?
I'll keep the peace, Mr. King...
...but you keep your promise.
Hear your name's Rawlings, you're from Ohio.
Your pa's name couldn't be
Linus Rawlings, could it?
- Could be.
- Knew him.
Jethro Stuart.
- He used to speak of you.
- Used to?
Pa was killed at Shiloh.
Sit down, Mr. Stuart.
Well, better than dying behind a plow.
I tried it. Settled down for a year once.
Took 10 years off my life.
Your ma...
She must've been something real special getting old Linus to stay put.
She was, Mr. Stuart. Very special.
Old Linus.
Two years running once.
Your pa and me trapped together.
Up along the Waunakee.
Got so many beaver, we had to tie them tail-to-tail...
...just to drag them down the mountain.
Over a mile long it was, that line of beaver pelts.
Mr. Stuart, my father could take the truth and stretch it about six ways.
You sound just like him.
I'll take it you meant that kindly.
Well, I'd think twice before I called you a liar.
Tell me something, talking about liars.
Why would a son of old Linus get mixed up with a man like Mike King?
I know what you mean.
- But Mike King isn't the railroad.
- Oh?
I don't think he knows that.
He's changing the route back, is he?
No.
I know.
But he'd do anything to gain a day on the Central Pacific.
He's not a fool. He doesn't want a war, and neither do the Arapahos.
I think I could get them to agree to this change in route...
...if I sit down and talk with them for a while.
- How you gonna get them to do it?
- That's just it.
I need somebody that knows the language and who they trust.
You wouldn't happen to know someone like that, would you, Mr. Stuart?
Your pa could set a trap like no man I ever come across.
Just coax them on and, bam.
You'd better do something so he'll know you're pledging your word.
That blame whistle's like the crack of doom for all that's natural.
My ma felt a man ought to make his scratch on the land.
Leave it a little different than when he come.
Anyway, thanks for fixing things with the chief.
Me? I fixed nothing.
You put the words to my mouth but that won't make them come true.
Jethro, I said what I had to to keep the peace.
- I know there's a risk.
- Risk?
Maybe you don't understand.
You pledged your word back there.
Not mine, not the Army's, not the railroad's.
It's your word told them they'd keep their hunting grounds.
- I think they will.
- I think you got your neck stuck out...
...like a prairie chicken waiting for one side or the other to chop it off.
Your pa and me got kicked out of one territory after another...
...with people pouring in, killing off game, putting up towns.
It ain't gonna stop.
Your treaty's gonna get broke and
I don't wanna be around to see it happen.
Look me up when you get your bellyful.
- Where you going?
- Heading back to the mountains.
A high lonesome where there ain't no people at all yet.
So long.
By now, the Central Pacific had broken
through the wall of the high Sierras...
... and was straining eastward
across the flatlands of Nevada.
While the Union Pacific,
thanks to its long peace with the Indians...
... was able to keep up pressure
just as avidly in the opposite direction.
The competition was exciting,
but also costly...
... and both companies were itching
to earn money from tracks already laid.
Did the horses ride all right, Jake?
- No better than I did.
We'll have to rest them a day before we can start hunting rabbits, much less buffalo.
Just get them to water right away.
You say no buffalo hunter come.
White man, liar.
We scout for you no more.
Not in our lifetime, you said.
And there they are.
The buffalo slaughterers and the settlers.
All right, it's sooner than I figured.
But the railroad's broke.
They need money to keep moving on.
No people, no money.
No money, no railroad.
- It's as simple as that.
- What about the Arapahos?
Just take a look at those people.
Half of them straight from Europe.
They'll have a rough time, but they'll make it.
And do you wanna know why they'll make it?
Because they're willing to change their ways.
Arapahos will have to change too.
If they don't, they're finished.
I know they have to and someday the land will be taken over...
...by these farmers with their towns and their cattle.
But not like this.
They don't have to be double-crossed, and I don't have to be a part of it.
You don't, lieutenant?
Well, aren't you forgetting that uniform?
That's right, Mr. King, I'm forgetting it.
If the Army hasn't got any authority out here, I'm resigning. And now.
I don't see how that's gonna help the Arapahos.
Nothing will help them.
But nothing's gonna stop them.
Indian attack!
Indian attack! Take cover!
Take a good look.
You wanted a war and you got one.
I hope you're the first man killed in it.
Turn those wagons over!
Shoot for the lead horses.
Pick off the chief.
Rawlings, try that.
The Indians are stampeding the buffalo.
Dirty skunks. Come on.
I told you there'd be no war.
Look at them.
They've quit.
They'll be back.
They just sent a bunch of animals to kill an animal they call the "iron horse."
Well, it's still standing, isn't it?
And nothing's gonna stop it.
You think you can live with that?
I can live with it, or I can die with it.
Just listen.
You can live with that?
That?
That ain't crying.
That's just new life going on.
Pick up this woman and put the rest of the injured in the tent house.
Hey, Merv...
The rest of you, back to work.
We got a railroad to build.
Well...
Looks like you finally got your bellyful.
Hello, Jethro.
Appears you're doing well.
Can't complain.
Creek's loaded with beavers, fighting their way into the trap.
No white men looking over my shoulder...
...and the Indians are plumb cordial.
Toss your stuff in there.
Plenty of room for two.
Thanks.
You'll be bunking yonder.
Take your bearings now so you can find it when you need it.
If you don't like my snoring, you can build your own cabin.
I'll furnish the ax.
- Thanks. I'm just passing through.
- Through to where?
Anywhere you go is like where you've been.
Ain't you lost enough tail feathers back there?
I've been plucked some.
But that's what I like about this country.
There's always greener grass over the next hill.
Not no more.
Not since that damn railroad come.
All the grass is being staked out now, with a lock on it.
Maybe I'll just have to climb a little higher hill to find it.
How about coming along?
You crazy?
Like the Indians say, "These rocks and trees around here feel no call to move."
Why should I?
Guess I'm not an Indian, Jethro.
But I'm sure not a rock nor a tree.
Man belongs his own kind, like him or not.
The coming of railroads brought changes
in the land through which they passed.
Now immense herds of cattle were driven
hundreds of miles to meet the lines...
... bound for markets in the East.
Fences went up, cattle trails were barred...
... and a long and bloody wrangle began
between cattlemen and homesteaders.
The law was in the hands of whoever
could shoot fast and straight...
... except where there was somebody
determined to stand for law.
Others might look on sheep and a shepherd
as a pastoral scene.
Not the cattleman.
To him, sheep destroyed grass,
and grass came dear.
And if a man's life were held cheaper
than grass...
... it was considered a casualty of war,
not a crime.
And, in all this, the man with the star
was only one against many.
But time was running out
for the reckless ones...
... the desperadoes,
the gallop-and-gunshot boys...
... as more and more citizens demanded
respect for the law...
... and showed themselves ready to fight
to uphold it.
And the raw new towns that sprung up
in the West began to dream...
... of becoming as refined as that one-time
hooligan city by the Golden Gate.
San Francisco was now respectable.
So sophisticated, in fact,
it even had mansions up for auction.
Two thousand dollars.
Two thousand dollars.
Is that your last bid?
Ladies and gentlemen, this trophy is solid gold and fully inscribed.
"Mr. Cleve Van Valen, president.
San Francisco-Kansas City Railroad."
It's a treasure he held dear to his heart.
Do I hear $3000 for this priceless possession?
Priceless, my foot.
We used it for a doorstop.
- Twenty-five hundred.
- Twenty-five hundred dollars.
Twenty-five hundred dollars.
Twenty-five hundred? Sold $2500.
It's a sad day, Lilith.
Sad?
We made and spent three fortunes together.
What's so sad about that?
And if he'd lived a little longer, we would've made and spent another.
- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Van Valen.
- What?
The chair, it's been sold. I'm sorry.
Well then, take it.
Quit apologizing and take it.
Thank you, madam.
If there'd been some other way to pay off the debts...
It doesn't matter.
I've got two things no one can ever take from me:
This and my land in Arizona.
Lilith, I don't want to dash any hopes...
...but that ranch is nearly worthless.
Well, it's there, isn't it?
Yes, but most of the cattle have been sold off or stolen.
- I'll get cattle.
- You'll need someone to work it.
- Someone to manage it for you.
- I'll get that too.
Who?
My nephew.
He's a marshal out there somewhere.
Now, Lilith, at your age, it might be kind of rough.
Rough?
My ma and pa were killed going down the river just looking for land.
I guess I got a little of that Prescott blood in me after all.
Pa?
Is Aunt Lilith's house on Nob Hill as high as that?
I don't know, son.
On our way home, you ask your aunt Lilith.
She'll tell you.
Honey? Do you think you'll know her?
- What?
- You aunt Lilith.
- Do you think you'll recognize her?
- Sure.
Zeb? What's the matter?
Nothing.
Come on.
Thank you.
- Ma'am, are you our great-aunt Lilith?
- If you're Zeb's children, I am.
- Lilith.
- Zeb.
Zeb Rawlings.
Oh, goodness.
I swore up and down I wasn't gonna cry.
You're just as pretty as Ma said you was.
I'd like you to meet my wife, Julie.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm pleased to meet you too.
I just can't tell you how pleased.
This here's Eve, underneath all the jam.
- Come on and meet Sam now.
- Sam?
Sam's our horse.
He could pull two wagons if he wanted.
Oh, well, if you'll excuse me,
I have my orders to meet Sam.
Come on.
- Oh, just a minute now, boys.
- But he's on the other side.
Come on.
Okay.
Come on.
Just a minute.
I think this means a whole lot to her.
You have no idea how much it means to me...
...to be able to settle down to a life of peace and quiet.
I'll get the luggage.
Hello, boys.
Jake.
Tom.
Pablo.
Zeb. Let's go.
Now, marshal, don't tell me you come all the way to Gold City just to meet me?
I hardly expected it.
And the beautiful... Mrs. Rawlings?
What a pleasure.
I envy you, marshal.
A well-favored, bright-eyed wife...
...just as dazzling as that sun up there.
Makes you almost thankful, don't it?
It makes a person wanna live.
That's Charlie Gant.
I thought you said he was in Montana.
Zeb?
I'm just gonna get the luggage, that's all.
See to the rooms, will you, Julie?
- Prescott, take care of the horses.
- Yes, sir.
- Linus, help your mother.
- Yes, sir.
Anything wrong, Julie?
No. No, nothing.
Come on, Eve.
- Lou.
- Zeb.
Got a minute?
Of course I got a minute.
Here.
Now, I urge you, most respectfully to peruse the...
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.
Well, what can I do for you?
Go ahead, name it.
I saw Gant get off the train this morning.
There were three men waiting for him.
That's why you're here, huh?
That's it.
Look, there ain't a thing we can do...
...to keep Charlie Gant from going where he wants to in this territory.
I know. I know what he was...
...but that's over now.
It was over the day his brother got...
Should've killed them both that day, but...
Well, you didn't.
There ain't a thing I can do about it now.
What's he doing here, Lou?
Ain't you even curious?
Well, what do you want me to do?
Run him out of town at the point of a gun?
Do you think we still put the law inside a holster here?
Look over there, Zeb. There's the law.
With all its writs and decrees and...
- We abide by that circuit judge now.
- How many get killed meantime?
Nobody's got killed. Nobody's going to.
Doc Holliday, the Clantons, the Youngers...
- They're all gone now.
- Charlie Gant ain't gone.
You get me a warrant. I'll get you Gant.
Lou? They want three guards in the wagon with the gold shipment tomorrow.
- Three?
- This is a big one. Over $100,000 worth.
I'll take Clayton and Sims with me, all right?
Well?
Well what?
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- It means we put on a three-man guard.
- To the train.
What happens then?
You know there's gold going out here every month or so.
There hasn't been a train robbery since Jesse James was killed.
Now, if the councilors wish to have a conference, we'll have one.
Zeb.
I don't want any trouble here now.
We've been friends a long time.
As a friend...
...I'd like you to leave town.
Boys, get back from there.
Look down there, son.
- Do you know how deep that shaft is?
- Uh-uh.
That's a thousand foot deep.
Do you know how deep a thousand foot is?
Uh-uh.
Well, if you had 200 brothers, all standing on your shoulders...
...you wouldn't be able to see over the top.
- I'd be squished.
Come on.
I'll show you boys the donkey engine.
You boys go ahead.
I'll be along in a minute.
I hear you've been talking to the local marshal about me.
- Would you call that friendly?
- I never considered us exactly friendly.
I don't like you, marshal.
I don't like what you and your kind are doing to this country.
Now, I don't want any trouble.
But you wanna put things on the old basis, just you and me?
That's fine.
I'm not gonna get in a fight with you, Gant.
It's peace you want, huh, marshal?
Peace?
There's only one kind I know of.
That's the kind my brother's got.
What happened to your brother didn't teach you very much, did it?
Easy, marshal.
Floyd never made mistakes...
...except the one time he trusted you.
And you're the one that got away.
One of these days, I'm likely to pay you Rawlingses a little visit.
Come on, move along.
Get those gold boxes up there.
That's a lot of gold.
Come on, keep moving, boys.
Zeb?
Lou Ramsey's here.
Lou.
- I warned you, Zeb.
- What is it?
Gant came to see me last night.
Said you tried to start some trouble with him.
You believe him?
I'm telling you, Zeb, you take your trouble to your own territory.
I don't want any more of it here.
There won't be any more trouble, Lou.
Gant's gone.
Rode out of here early this morning.
With who?
His gang.
They should be somewhere between here and Kingman...
...waiting on that train.
You don't fool me for a minute, Zeb.
You are not looking for a robbery, you're looking for Gant.
You still carry lead where he shot you.
That was Texas.
And Oklahoma, where you killed Floyd.
And now this.
I'm sorry, Julie...
...but I don't want my office to be any part of this.
Zeb?
The boys have got the team hitched.
I know.
It's almost time to go.
Zeb?
- Julie.
- No one's asking you to face Gant.
No one's making you.
We could ride out of here right now.
We could forget it.
Maybe there's something you haven't told me.
Is there, Zeb?
I'm asking you not to go.
Please.
Don't go.
Sorry, Julie.
I guess there's nothing more pigheaded in a man than his sense of honor.
They're all the same, every one of them.
You take my Cleve now.
Never could turn down a poker game.
Felt duty-bound to go.
Three nights running sometimes, but he wouldn't quit...
...not if his life depended on it. He...
I guess it isn't very funny.
Ma?
Where's Pa?
Out. That's where he is.
- What's the matter with Mom?
Nothing's the matter.
Come on, now, in the other room.
- What's the matter?
Come on, we're gonna play.
That's a good girl. That's better.
What's the matter with Mama?
- Nothing's the matter.
Do you know any games?
We know tag.
Musical chairs.
- Ugh. Tag.
- I know hide-and-seek.
Well, do you know how to play poker?
- Poker?
- Poker?
You're in luck. Sit down right there.
Now, come on, sit down. That's it.
But we don't know how to play poker.
Well, it's time you learned.
First, we'll start off with a little five-card stud.
I'll take that rifle, Zeb.
Your pistol too.
Sorry, Lou.
I just can't oblige.
Thought the law wouldn't let you use that anymore.
I'll use it if I have to.
I'm going out of here, Lou, and I'm taking this with me.
To kill Gant.
That's what you think, isn't it?
It's something personal between him and me.
Well, Lou, it could be...
...if I settle down with my family and wait for him to come.
And he'll come if I don't stop him here and now.
I'm gonna catch Gant red-handed, breaking the law...
...and then I'm gonna use the law to put him away once and for all.
The law, Lou.
I'm gonna use the law...
...but I haven't got much chance without your help.
How many men in the caboose?
Just one brakeman.
- Is he armed?
- No, never has been.
I'll be in the express car.
Thanks, Lou.
Marshal?
There's some riders up ahead.
I'll take a look.
Engineer, there's a barricade ahead!
Open it up, wide open.
Zeb!
Come on. Come on.
Everyone make it?
- Frenchy's horse fell.
- I don't think he made it.
- Well, let's move.
It's a long way from here to that gold.
There's no danger. Just keep going.
It's Rawlings.
Back this train up!
And fast!
How come we're leaving so early, Pa?
We got a long way to go, son.
Here.
Auntie, when we going to your house?
Your daddy will decide when we get to your home.
Auntie, can we take Sam with us?
I think Sam is taking us.
Pa, how much further is it to Aunt Lilith's ranch?
Well, son, it's around the next bend, the next bend...
...and the valley beyond.
- Oh.
- Aunt Lilith, do you know that song?
LINUS: That's our song.
Your song?
I sang that song long before your pa was ever born.
Come on.
Zeb.
The West that was won by its pioneers,
settlers, adventurers is long gone now.
Yet it is theirs forever.
For they left tracks in history
that will never be eroded by wind or rain...
... never plowed under by tractors,
never buried in the compost of events.
Out of the hard simplicity of their lives,
out of their vitality...
... their hopes and their sorrows...
... grew legends of courage and pride...
... to inspire their children
and their children's children.
From soil enriched by their blood...
... out of their fever to explore and build...
... came lakes where once
were burning deserts...
... came the goods of the earth,
mines and wheat fields...
... orchards and great lumber mills...
... all the sinews of a growing country.
Out of their rude settlements,
their trading posts, came cities...
... to rank among the great ones
of the world.
All the heritage of a people
free to dream...
... free to act,
free to mold their own destiny.
- Americano.
- Sì, americano.
Ah! Pilota!
Party, inward... turn!
Party... flag!
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God to take unto himself...
...the soul of our dear brother here departed...
...we therefore commit his body to the ground.
Uno, due, tre!
Detail, outward... turn!
Detail... quick march!
Major Fincham, will you now please dismiss your men? Please.
- Where is your commandant?
- As I told you, Major Battaglia is indisposed.
His orders are to disperse immediately after the funeral.
- Major Fincham, please.
- Get that Fascist bastard out here!
Grazie.
- You'd better follow me, please, Colonel.
- Thanks, pal.
What are they celebrating out there?
Signor maggiore.
Ryan, Joseph L.
United States Army Air Corps. 0718359.
Don't you salute senior officers in your army, Major?
- Are you the official interpreter?
- Yes, sir.
- Then interpret exactly. Clear?
- Yes, sir.
And add this: No wonder Italy's losing the war, with officers like him.
Well?
Battaglia! Battaglia!
Battaglia! Battaglia!
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!
Battaglia! Battaglia!
We have today buried our commanding officer...
...Colonel Brian David Lockart!
The purpose of this parade is to bear witness to his death...
...and charge the man responsible for it!
Major Battaglia!
The Ninth Fusiliers now formally charge you with the murder of Colonel Lockart!
Come forward and meet your accusers!
Sì, signor maggiore.
Battaglia! Battaglia!
Follow me, please.
Battaglia! Battaglia! Battaglia!
Major Fincham, unless you dismiss your men now, it will be out of my hands.
- That swine hasn't the guts.
- You have left him no choice.
You've shot one of my men!
He's fainted, sir. It's Ransom.
One of those from hospital.
Dismiss.
Parade... dismiss!
Captain Stein! One moment.
This is Colonel Ryan.
He needs your attention too.
- American.
- Army Air Corps.
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we still beating them in Sicily?
We took Messina three days ago.
- Are you reporting for sick parade, Sergeant?
- No, sir.
I'm still trying to get what my boys have needed all along.
I'm afraid I still have the same answer for you: There isn't any.
Easy, fellas. Easy.
Over here, Colonel.
The stool will do.
- Looks like you got a full house.
- And getting fuller, I'm afraid.
- What's the matter with these men?
- Malaria, scurvy.
Made worse by malnutrition.
- I've only alcohol for a disinfectant.
- Go right ahead, Doc.
How come you can't control the malaria with drugs?
The Eyeties make no mepacrine.
The Eyeties grow food.
Get extra rations for your sick.
And clean up some of this filth.
And perhaps get 'em some clean uniforms.
Our diet and filth are Battaglia's punishment for escape attempts.
He's taken our soap and razors, turned off our shower baths...
...issued us with no uniforms or Red Cross parcels, and kept us on half rations.
But he can't break us, and he can't stop us trying to escape.
Even with the way the war is going for us now?
Are you suggesting we should knuckle under?
If that's what it takes, yes.
Liberation can only be a few weeks away.
Did you hear the colonel's suggestion, fellas?
What do you think?
Well... meanin' no disrespect to him, sir...
...I'd say the colonel ought to muck off, sir.
I can't expect you to understand this, but these men belong to the Ninth Fusiliers.
This regiment fought with Mariborough in 1704...
...with Wellington against Napoleon, and in the Crimea.
These men are all volunteers, professionals, and they've come to fight a war.
It may come as news to you, Major, but that's why we're all here.
Yes, but each in his different way. You ought to know that. You're a professional.
Negative. I'm what they call at home a 90-day wonder.
- I'm an airplane driver. My business is flying.
- Ours is soldiering.
OK, clue me. Suppose you do rig an escape.
How many men do you figure to get clear?
- Colonel Ryan, if one gets out, it's a victory.
- Sure it is.
Can somebody show me where I bunk?
- Sergeant Major.
- Sir?
- Escort Colonel Ryan to his quarters.
- Yes, sir.
We dine at six, sir.
- Major.
- This way, Colonel.
Sergeant Bostick, sir. 113th Tank Division.
This is Corporal Giannini, and Private Ames.
The reason we didn't say anything to you in the sickbay, we wanted to get you alone.
They've all gone to mess.
- Are you cold, son?
- It's that damn malaria.
Don't knock it, Bostick. You ever have it,
Colonel? The fever makes you dream.
And, man, what dreams!
You know what I mean, sir?
- No. What?
- Well, they...
Hey. He's pretty sharp, huh?
You're a welcome sight, sir.
We need an American officer real bad.
- How many of us are there?
- Eight. We've lost two.
And if we don't get some decent grub and medicine, that's gonna double and triple.
That's tough. From what I've seen, everybody's in the same boat.
Sure, because the guys running it are section eight.
Those stir-crazy limey officers are trying to fight the war from in here.
They got so many tunnels dug, you could fall into one.
- You expect me to keep them from digging?
- You got the rank for it, sir.
Don't get us wrong, sir. Nobody's here to defend Battaglia. He's a two-bit Mussolini.
But if they'd let up, he would too.
With Sicily gone, our guys will come through
Italy like shoe polish through a tin horn.
All we gotta do is get healthy, sit tight and wait.
These people have been here for two years.
I just got here. I need time to check this out.
Not too long. Please, sir.
Three of my boys are just about gone now.
Colonel Ryan, this is Captain Costanzo, our regimental chaplain.
- Lieutenant Orde.
- Lieutenant.
- Delighted, Colonel Ryan.
- Please sit down. Sorry I kept you waiting.
Colonel Lockart always sat here.
I'll be fine right here. Thank you.
Major, if you don't mind talking about it, how did your colonel buy it?
He struck Battaglia with his stick.
Do you see that sweatbox there?
Colonel Lockart died in there last night.
Which makes you the senior officer of this camp.
My regiment will await your orders.
It's still your regiment, Major.
Thank you, sir.
It's made from pumpkins, you know.
Just a little different, don't you think?
We couldn't help noticing where you sat, Colonel.
It took 200 years to make officers like those. It took me 90 days.
- They're nuts, sir.
- It's their ball game.
- We're still shut out.
- We did as good with a sergeant.
Now we got us a bird colonel.
A bird colonel outranks a birdbrain. Clear?
- Anything else, Sergeant?
- No, sir.
Bird is right. Chicken.
OK, OK. Now we know we're on our own.
- Do you feel up to a bit of running, sir?
- Running?
Dodging the lights, I mean.
It's pretty important.
- What the hell is this?
- Earth, sir, from the tunnel.
We reckon the barracks ceiling can hold two tons of it if we spread it around right.
Sorry to ask you to make this trip, but I thought you ought to be here.
Your countrymen were caught trying to steal supplies.
- What supplies, Major?
- Escape rations. See for yourself.
These men are thieves.
But since they're Americans,
I wanted your approval to punish them.
- What's your side?
- My boys need things from those parcels, sir.
- Food. And more important, mepacrine.
- That true, Major?
Perfectly. But these men are thieves and should be punished.
Negative. These men are sick. You've also got
50 men in sickbay with the same disease.
- What the hell are you doing about that?
- War produces casualties, Colonel.
Everyone in camp's been exposed to malaria.
The only way a man has a chance of escape is for him to have mepacrine to keep him going.
Forget the punishment, Major. Bostick, get these men outta here. See me later.
- My boys are sick, sir.
- Out.
- Major, move those parcels to the sickbay.
- What did you say?
- That's a direct order.
- Damn your direct order!
I'm the ranking officer here. You'll deliver those parcels tonight. Is that clear, mister?
You'd better know what you're doing, unless you want a mutiny on your hands.
Mutiny in the Ninth Fusiliers?
Wellington and Mariborough would spin in their graves, Major, what?
321 present, 83 in hospital,
404 men present or accounted for.
- You may dismiss.
- If you don't mind, Captain...
...l'm assuming command as senior officer of the camp.
That is, of course, between you.
I will inform Major Battaglia.
I'd rather do that personally.
Will you take me to him?
Rest the men, Major, but keep them here.
Stand at... ease!
Stand easy.
Avanti!
My major warns you that he has no patience left with the prisoners.
By taking command, you have become personally responsible for their actions.
Good.
And tell him that, from now on, things will be much more different than they've been.
You have made a good impression on the major.
- But he warns you against trying to trick him.
- Never. Of course not.
Ask the major to come with me now. I'll prove how different things'll be around this camp.
What in heaven's name is he doing?
What does it look like?
Ryan!
Ryan!
Ryan, you can't do this.
You can't do this to anyone.
- I'm glad you could join us, Major.
- If you betray us, you'll pay for it.
You're just in time to watch. Have the men turn about face so they can watch too. Major?
Sergeant Bostick, rip up that shower floor.
Parade... about... turn!
All right. Now hear this.
While I'm in command, anyone attempting to escape will be held for court martial.
Clear?
Stand steady on parade!
You'll get the Nazi Iron Cross for this, Von Ryan!
By order of the commandant, the showers will be turned on at 1200 hours.
Razors will be provided and delousing powder issued.
Beginning tonight, Red Cross parcels will be distributed once a week.
- You may dismiss the parade.
- Not so fast, Captain.
What about the clothing in the Red Cross parcels in that storage house?
I advise you to forget this matter.
Sure, because Battaglia's got a black market going in Red Cross clothes. Right?
You tell this man I trusted him as a gentleman. I want those clothes.
I'm sorry. The major says he cannot issue... wine.
Wine? Who the hell said anything about wine? I'm talking about clothes.
It's for your own good, Colonel.
You let yourself be bought pretty cheaply, didn't you?
Louse powder and hot water? Hah!
- Orde, dismiss the men.
- I'll tell you when to dismiss, Lieutenant.
Bostick, tear the door off that bathhouse, and use anything else you might need.
Right, sir.
Major Fincham, you will give an order for the men to strip.
Strip. Understand? Naked.
Parade... strip.
Now take off all of those rags. All of them!
And, Major, that goes for the officers as well.
Pass thatjunk from the rear to the front of the line and throw it in the fire!
Captain Costanzo, I said strip.
Sir, I take being a member of the cloth literally.
I bow to your convictions, Captain.
- Here comes II Duce!
- Attention!
The major feels the fire should be put out at once.
Tell him we have no firefighting equipment.
- He says you are no gentleman, Colonel.
- Only by an act of Congress.
Now what about the clothing?
The prisoners will be issued clothing,
Colonel Ryan.
But you, sir, I'm afraid, must follow me.
Good show, Colonel!
Major Fincham!
You may dismiss when ready.
We made it, Colonel. Our guys landed at Salerno. Italy's surrendered.
That's great. Just great.
Yeah. Our guys are ready to shove off, but these limeys back here are giving us trouble.
Hello, sir. Are you all right?
Could you come right away? There's trouble.
- There are no guards.
- They bolted during the night.
Major Fincham took Battaglia prisoner.
He's court-martialling him.
Let the regimental records show Captain
Stein appearing as defending officer...
...Lieutenant Orde as prosecuting officer.
Major Fincham presiding.
If the court pleases.
- Colonel Ryan, this is no affair of yours.
- I'm still the senior officer in this camp.
We're holding a summary court martial exactly according to regulations.
What happens when you find him guilty, according to regulations?
- He will be hanged.
- That'll be murder. He's now a civilian.
No, sir. We're still at war, and the enemy is still the enemy.
I say hang him!
Major, release this man.
Oriani, get him outta here.
The parade will stand at ease!
The major begs me to say that...
...he never meant you harm.
It was Mussolini and his Fascists who forced him to be harsh.
Now it's all finished for Italy.
Let the killing be finished too.
You want your revenge with this?
I wantjustice.
Not only for Colonel Lockart and the other dead, but for those of us who are still alive.
We're 200 miles behind the lines.
I say not only military justice but military sense dictates we cannot turn this man loose.
- Aye!
- There's a better way, Major.
- You all wantjustice?
-  Yes!
Then do to him what he did to your colonel.
Put him in a sweatbox to rot.
- No!
- Yes!
You fool.
- You soft-headed, sentimental fool.
- That's privilege of rank, Major.
Damn your rank. If letting that scum live costs the life of one of my men, I promise...
Scatter! Hit the deck! Hit the deck!
He pinpointed us. We'd better move quick.
- Brilliant, Colonel. Where?
- We're a day's march from the coast.
- I could contact your navy.
- Move 400 men in daylight? You're mad.
- I'll lead you.
- Why should you?
You think you hate the Germans more than I do?
- It's worth a chance.
- I don't trust the Eyeties.
But I'm in command here and I say we move - now.
Halt!
German convoy! Everybody down!
Those ruins could hide a thousand men.
Let them rest there for the night while I go ahead and contact the ships.
How much farther to the coast?
Five... perhaps six miles.
I should be back well before dawn.
That's as pretty a place for a trap as I've ever seen.
Good luck, Oriani. We'll be waiting for you. Now let's go.
Kamerad.
Face it, Yank.
Your little Eyetie chum has deserted us.
We're left in a box.
Colonel!
Something's moving!
Out! Out!
Germans! Scatter!
Scatter! Scatter! Come on!
OK. Now.
Hold it. Hold it!
Colonel Ryan, Major Fincham, Captain Stein and Costanzo, Lieutenant Orde - the front car.
I'm a doctor. I stay with the wounded.
They will remain behind so we can care for them properly. Get aboard, gentlemen.
That little Eyetie bastard Oriani led us to the railhead and turned us in.
It was that pig who betrayed us!
I'll kill you!
They've cared for our wounded properly now.
The poor bastards.
Just cos you let Battaglia live!
You'll get your Iron Cross now, Von Ryan.
Hey, the roads are full of Germans.
It means we must still be headed north.
You can bet on it, Yank. Von Ryan's got us all a one-way ticket to the Fatherland.
- Yeah!
- Aw, blow it out your barracks bag, mate.
Listen, I'll take you on any time you like!
We are coming in to Rome.
I am Major von Klement, now in command of this prison train.
You will be in my charge until we reach the final destination.
You have now 30 minutes for rest, relief, and there is food and water for all.
Major von Klement?
Captain Oriani is an Italian officer. He's not a prisoner of war. He doesn't belong with us.
I have my orders.
Heil Hitler.
The guards are on top again.
They're not needed here as far as we're concerned.
No chance of our tunnelling through this coop, Von Ryan.
Say, Doc, you got a knife in that manicuring kit of yours?
Are you planning to snip your way through it?
No.
I'm planning to tunnel my way through it.
Do you mind, Major?
No, no, Colonel, wait. Wait until... until the wheels hit cross tracks.
It will cover the sound of the wood breaking.
It's impossible to get out while we are moving.
- And when we stop, the guards will patrol.
- If it's dark when we stop, I'll risk it.
- What about the rest? If one goes, we all go.
- Do we, now? Mind telling me how?
- We'll have to eliminate the guards.
- Brilliant!
They have machine pistols and we have bare hands.
If we could take one gun from one guard...
Oriani?
Turn around.
Go on. Just turn around.
Learn that from the cowboy films, did you?
You got a better idea?
It would take you too long to strangle a man, Colonel Ryan.
The average Nazi would get impatient while you were doing it.
Orde.
The knots smash his larynx, the knee breaks his back. He's dead in 15 seconds.
Thug garrotte - India.
All right, then. Now what's your scheme?
If you haven't the guts for it, I'll do it.
We're stopping again.
Something must have gone wrong.
- Perhaps they've been caught.
- Take it easy, Padre.
- There's a station up ahead.
- Wait.
- Someone might be watching.
- It's a chance we'll take.
The guards are on this side.
Open the door on that side.
- What kind of insanity...
- Knock it off.
- Get the men on the roof right away.
- Right, sir.
If you fail, the Germans won't have to kill you. I will.
Shut up.
Shh. Shh.
Bostick, you follow me with half the men.
Dunbar, spread out with the rest. Move. Quiet.
Let's turn 'em loose.
- Can we get moving?
- The engineer's alive but not the fireman.
- I can stoke the boiler, sir.
- Get Oriani up with the engineer.
- Send the chaplain and the doctor here.
- Yes, sir. Get those bodies in the boxcar!
Get this stiff in the boxcar.
Get those bods in quick!
Move, you people! Come on, move!
Ten more minutes... Of all the luck!
He'll have to stop for water, same as we did.
By the time he gets goin' we'll be miles away.
Damn thing's right behind us.
Can you bring him around? We'll need him.
Come on. Come on!
All the comforts of home.
Please. I am Italian.
I have done nothing. Please.
- What on earth are you doing here, my child?
- Padre, you're priceless.
Don't you think she ought to get dressed while we discuss it?
He's right. Go on, girl. No one will hurt you.
Now, about some questions, Major.
- May I rise?
- Of course.
I will answer no questions, Herr Oberst.
Major... All your guards are dead.
We're running this train now.
I want the schedule of when and where we're gonna get that food you promised us. Clear?
- Florence at 0600 hours.
- And what happens in Florence?
The train will stop in the rail complex and the prisoners can dismount.
Colonel Ryan! Colonel, look!
Looks like we're headed for Innsbruck.
What do these circles mean, Major?
I am to receive instructions in those cities from the dispatchers. I, myself. No one else.
Did you receive those instructions through that radio there?
- No. It is a simple commercial radio.
- All right. Over there.
Lieutenant, if he wiggles, put a hole in him.
- They're keeping pace with us.
- A German troop train is on this schedule.
Gentlemen, you have been very daring.
Yet what have you gained?
In Florence, other troops are waiting.
You have been brave.
If you now wish to be sensible, I will see that you are treated with respect in Florence.
We had a sample of your Nazi respect when we boarded this train.
- Still, you have no choice.
- And nothing to lose by trying to make one.
Von Klement's identification papers and railroad priority, good as far as Florence.
- You do very well with German, Padre.
- I studied in Germany.
I went to Breslau after Oxford.
Would the dispatcher in Florence recognise the major by sight?
- He'd be an Italian, wouldn't he?
- Of course! Under German supervision.
- And I think you're lying.
- I'd say, with the country in such a flap...
...the chances that the dispatcher will ask for identification is pretty small.
Will ask whom? I mean, you just said just now...
- Yes. It'll just have to be the chance we take.
- You are extremely foolish!
- Quite right.
- Oh, no. But I...
But... look at this picture!
I don't look remotely like this chap.
No, no. I won't do it.
I won't do it. Absolutely not.
- Heil Hitler!
- That's better. Now let's see you walk.
- It won't work, you know.
- Yes, it will. Let's see you walk.
Put some style into it. Hand on your hip.
The Boche have style.
Slap your gloves against your leg.
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler.
Gut. Sehr gut.
I think you had him goin' there, vicar.
You all set?
Yes, sir. I came over the tops of the cars to check. 14 of our guys are stationed as guards.
The rest of the uniforms were too bloody.
- Did you get rid of the bodies?
- While we were passing over the last bridge.
The lieutenant wants our men down from the top of the train, to be fed first.
If they get down, we're dead.
They can't speak German.
We've had it.
Crikey! Ain't that our vicar?
Better check our lovebirds.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler!
Heil Hitler.
- Here they come!
- My God, they've done it!
Well done, Padre. You've done it.
My God, you've done it.
Believe it or not, the poor devil's fainted.
They must be moving a couple of divisions south.
From the map, we'll be away from the main roads by dark.
The men could be gone in ten minutes.
How do we get ten minutes with that troop train only five behind us?
- It could turn off at Bologna.
- Or follow us straight to Berlin.
Escaped? We haven't escaped.
All we're doing is this bastard's job for him.
Exactly. And in Verona, which is marked by an X on the map, I will be properly grateful.
At Verona, both the train crew and guard detail is scheduled to be changed.
That's if we go to Verona.
Look here.
Suppose, when we get to Bologna, we...
...we could pass it and go to the left into Milano.
And you go, hm?
Perhaps on American railroads, yes?
But this train is under the orders of the German high command.
Such things are not possible.
To reroute a military train...
...requires a written order signed by a member of the general staff, Colonel.
Major, yours is not the only army that works in triplicate forms.
Obergruppenführer Wilhelm von Kleist.
- Does that mean general staff?
- It does indeed.
Well, now. We've got a pad full of blank forms and we've got a typewriter.
- I say! Wizard!
- We can't be any worse off than we are now.
Quite.
Let's say we type an order to Klement here.
Upon arriving in Bologna, he's told to go to Milan...
...where he is given confidential instructions from Gruppenführer...
- Give me a good Aryan name.
- Um... Ottfried. Johann Heinrich.
Gruppenführer Heinrich, who is in charge of a trainload of sealed boxcars...
...to be delivered to somebody... big, important.
- Fatso Goering.
- Der dicke Hermann. Brilliant!
- Loot for the Reichsmarschall.
- Major?
It might do. It's got enough nerve -
I'll give you that.
And we have it signed by our good friend from general staff, Wilhelm von Kleist.
- Amerikanisch, nicht?
- Ja.
Hauptmann Joseph Sonneberg, Herr Major.
Danke sehr.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Give this to the engineer.
Gestapo.
- How long is it now?
- Ten minutes, and my pulse is up 12 points.
- How'd it go?
- Piece of cake.
Leave it. Everybody stay low.
Gestapo. Get those blinds up.
Gestapo.
Nylon.
Amerikanische Zigaretten.
Ja.
That chap ought to be reported to his superiors.
That's the end of ruddy that.
Colonnello.
- We have found it.
- Found what?
We have found a place to leave the train.
An abandoned branch line halfway to Milano.
Come on. Let's have a look.
Looks to be about...
...90 miles.
- We'll get there by 2100 hours.
- Add half an hour, to stop for water.
- That's better still. It'll be good and dark.
- By morning, 90% of your men will be dead.
We don't need him any more. Or her either.
Don't flinch. If you haven't the stomach for it, it'll be my pleasure.
- I'll decide that.
- Like with Battaglia?
- That was different.
- I intend it to be.
- You'll take your orders, Major!
- I'm afraid not.
- For God's sake! These are people!
- People don't shoot wounded!
But they do commit murder in cold blood?
Are you that far gone?
May I go to my compartment now?
Yes, of course.
You haven't had any food since we took over the train.
- I'm not hungry.
- Of course you are. Here, take it. Relax.
You cannot hide it. I know you will do what the British major wants.
You mean to kill you both?
It is the right thing.
In your place, I would do it.
No, you wouldn't. You're not that tough.
- Then what do you want?
- Nothing.
Not to help me?
If I can, yes.
That is what all men say.
How old are you?
The first was the same man who helped my mother.
I was not yet confirmed then.
Such things do not happen in America?
- Why are you with this German?
- For food, for clothing. To stay alive.
- Is that all?
- There is a war, you know.
Yeah.
How did you say it?
Relax?
You think my legs are too thin?
Why don't you close the door?
I will.
On the way out.
-  We need water! We're hungry too!
- Knock it off in there!
- If they knew what was going on, they would.
- They'll just have to sweat it out.
What the hell are we waiting for now?
Come on!
They're gone. They're not here.
He's dead.
Back! Back! Get up on top!
- We can't leave them behind to talk.
- Cover that side. Work up toward the engine.
Get back!
All right. Let's move.
Get this train moving now!
Don't run away!
Get your hands off me or I'll blow your head off!
These tracks have quite a shine for not having been used.
Something's been running on this spur.
These tracks have been used recently.
But we don't know what's ahead.
It's deserted here. Let's get cracking.
- Last stop, Colonel?
- Last stop, soldier. Everybody out.
All cars unload!
- Those are not German planes.
- American?
No. British. Lancaster, I think.
Sorry to turn you out in the middle of nowhere, but it can't be helped.
Now, head for the mountains or the sea.
We'll form up again and have another crack at Jerry. Off you go, lads. Good luck.
Everybody back on the train!
Back on the train!
Get back! Get back on the train!
Come on, move! Back! Get in!
Come on, move! Back!
Oriani!
Take this train outta here! Go! Go! Come on!
Let the coward go!
Stop the train!
Bostick! Bostick!
- Injured to the lounge car!
- Tell Oriani to cut the burning cars loose!
- Where's Oriani? We're ready to roll.
- Roll? Roll where?
Three dead, and the rest need better help than
I can give 'em. Maybe it's the end of the line.
Colonnello.
This man thinks he can get us through.
- What are you talking about?
- Switzerland. The whole train. All of us.
- Switzerland?
- You're mad. You're all raving mad.
Here. North of Milano, where the track forks.
Since the war, all traffic goes right, into Germany.
But the left fork, the old Maloja Pass route, goes to Switzerland.
In a matter of hours we could be over the border and free.
- You know, it's possible.
- Yeah, maybe, but... Milano - that's the key.
- You think we can fool 'em again?
- The engineer says there is a way.
On the outskirts of Milano is a control tower at the beginning of the traffic complex.
This tower controls the whole Milano area.
If we can capture it and smash the signals, the main station, here...
...will not know where we are until they repair it, but by then it will be too late.
We can go through Milano without stopping?
Yes. The engineer says it can be done.
Let's move.
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!
Soon we cross back into the complex. If the power is back on, we will show on the board.
By then it will be full speed.
Too late for anyone to stop us.
- Can't this damn thing go any faster?
- Not before we reach the top of the pass.
From there it's downgrade all the way to Switzerland.
Shouldn't we go a bit slower?
If they've blocked the line ahead...
Keep it wide open. Let's move it.
Ryan.
- Whether we make it or not...
- We're gonna make it, Major.
What I'm trying to say is
I'm sorry it had to be you with the girl.
- Hey, mate, look! The Alps!
- We made it!
Now that we're over the hump, sir, Major
Fincham, I figured you'd want your stuff too.
Pepino! Pepino!
Messerschmitt!
He's trying to blow the engine.
Here comes his chum.
There's another one!
Oriani!
OK, let's go.
What the hell's he saying?
That footbridge leads around the mountain!
It's shorter than the tunnel to the other side.
- Fincham, get them moving on the catwalk.
- Follow me! Everybody follow me!
Move it! Move it!
- Come on, lads! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!
All right. Back! Back to the trestle!
Back!
Looks like they're takin' off.
Let's see those glasses.
No wonder they're takin' off. Let's go.
What about the German troop train back there?
- We have guns. We will stop them.
- Then what?
- He says we can replace the damaged track.
- Replace it with what?
It's simple. Remove track from behind the train - put it here.
Well, then let's get the troop train!
All those with Schmeissers, follow me!
This one's much too long.
Take that one there. Hurry up.
Clear this off! Clear this off! Hurry!
Pull! Pull!
Come on, hurry!
Come on, quick! That'll do it!
Move it!
Come on!
It didn't work! Back! Back!
Get back! Back!
Fire!
Come on, come on! Get it up!
Come on, hurry!
Let's pull back! Back!
Watch it! Over here! Stop!
Keep down! Hold your fire!
Fire!
Cease firing! Fall back!
- They'll try to outflank us now, huh?
- If they haven't already.
- Give me those grenades. I'll take some men.
- No. You're needed here.
Bostick, come with me.
Run!
Grenade!
Back!
There they are!
Come on, Ryan!
Come on, Major! Give me your hand!
Hurry!
Come on! Faster!
 I once told you, Ryan,
if only one gets out, it's a victory.

This is London.
Ed Murrow reporting.
To an American reporter...
...there is something very special about the people of this city...
...this island, this nation.
Never in the long and stormy history of Great Britain...
...have her fortunes been as low as they are in this spring of 1941.
Britain is fighting alone for her very existence,...
...fighting desperately.
Yet her people remain steadfast and unflinching.
Britain's allies have been defeated one by one,...
...as the dark stain of Nazi conquest spreads across the map of Europe.
In Africa, Rommel is giving the Eighth Army a very bad time.
Greece has fallen.
And the Luftwaffe continues to smash English cities.
The worst news of all comes from the North Atlantic,...
...where last month, German U-boats and surface raiders...
...sank 600,000 tons of shipping.
In this battle,
Britain's lifeblood is at stake.
This is the battle on which depend the future course of the war...
...the future course of British history.
The battle of the North Atlantic is fought at sea...
...but it is directed from the admiralty, here in London.
Very deep in the ancient
Admiralty Building,...
...200 feet underground, is the War Room.
Here is the guiding brain and central nervous system of the British Navy,...
...The Operations Division.
- Robert.
- Sir?
Take Captain Shepard's things and put them in the office.
Aye, Sir.
Thank you.
This, of course, is the message center for incoming and outgoing signals.
These tubes lead to the wireless room just down the hall.
Oh, Shepard...
- Anything wrong?
- That man's uniform.
Oh. We're quite informal here about some things.
You'll find it's much different from the bridge of a ship at sea.
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes. It has to be that way.
Shepard, this is Commander
Richards the duty plot officer.
Captain Shepard is the new director of operations.
- How do you do?
- Don't let me interrupt your meal.
Captain Shepard, Second Officer Anne Davis.
Captain Shepard's taking over for me.
- How do you do, Sir?
- How do you do?
Be nice to her, Shepard. If she ever got angry and walked out, we'd lose the war.
Really?
Seriously, you can depend on this young lady.
I've done it more times than I care to admit.
Anne, be a darling, will you and get your plot report in as soon as possible.
We mustn't be late for Jimmy's party tonight.
Right-oh.
I suppose I should shed a few tears at leaving this place, but...
...quite honestly, I've hated the job.
Too much responsibility, too much strain.
I'm getting a command at sea.
That's what I've always wanted.
Congratulations.
I hope you find one that doesn't involve too much strain.
Yes, The point is, it's a different kind of strain.
After all, if a man's going to serve in the navy, he ought to serve at sea...
...unless, of course, it's a man like yourself who's already seen a tremendous amount of action.
He should still serve at sea.
Yes. Well, I'd better get along.
I'll say good-bye now unless you have any questions.
I don't think so, thank you. Good luck.
Thank you.
We thought we might be of some assistance,
Sir,... not knowing your way around yet, Sir.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes, there is something you can do.
A few moments ago I saw a rating enter the War Room without his jumper.
From now on, everyone will be properly dressed at all times.
I cannot have officers eating sandwiches on duty, Commander Richards,...
...under any circumstances.
I'm sorry, Sir. It won't happen again.
Excuse me, Sir. I think you should know that Commander Richards...
...stood two watches without relief and...
I'm sure Commander Richards doesn't need an interpreter, Miss Davis.
I was also surprised to hear a Wren officer addressed by her Christian name.
To me, this kind of informality is both irregular and inexcusable.
Come in!
Sorry to interrupt, Sir.
- Priority signal.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
Come in.
Oh, Shepard.
- You know the assistant chief of naval staff.
- Yes, indeed, Sir. Very well.
How are you, Jonathan?
I'm glad to see you again.
Thank you. I have a signal here sent from our naval attache in Stockholm.
He reports two large German warships steaming through the Kattegat.
- What ships are they?
- He doesn't say.
Do you think it might be the Bismarck?
It's possible, Sir.
She's just completed three months' training in the Baltic.
They couldn't pick a better time to break out, could they?
With this Crete business going on, and our convoys scattered all over the ocean.
- I have a nasty hunch that's the idea, Sir.
- I hope for once you're wrong.
We can't afford to have that monster on the loose.
Look what Scharnhorst and Gneisenau did to us.
- 22 ships sunk... 115,000 tons.
- All in two months.
And they don't have anything like
Bismarck's fire power.
She could stand off and sink every ship in a convoy without ever coming under fire.
Shepard, get on to the Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet.
Tell him we're not sure, but we're very much concerned.
Tell him we'll let him have every scrap of information we get.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Oh, and, Shepard. I wish you'd prepare your recommendations in case it is the Bismarck.
Very good, Sir.
Pretty rough assignment for a new man on the job, isn't it?
I suppose, Sir, I'm not worried about Shepard.
He's one of the ablest men in the service.
I'm also told he's as cold as a witch's heart.
That's may be a slight exaggeration, Sir.
I want a man who's cold.
I'd like a man with no heart at all, no soul, just an enormous brain.
The battle of the North Atlantic is a grim business.
It won't be won by charm and personality.
- We've had too much of that here.
- I've known Shepard for years.
We've served together before.
He was different from these days.
Any particular reason for the change?
I suspect there are many reasons, Sir.
Reasons of a personal nature.
Oh. I see. Well, how are we going to get the information on those two ships?
- We have an agent in southern Norway, Sir,...
- Better get in touch with him.
We don't want to get in touch with him directly. It's much too dangerous.
And there isn't time to go through Zurich or Stockholm.
In this case, you'll have to make direct contact.
Sir, this man is in Nazi-occupied territory.
I realize that.
All the same, we must get in touch with him immediately.
Aye-aye, Sir.
The enemy ships were sighted coming out of the Baltic...
...obviously heading out to sea, obviously not in the service of the king.
Now, what have we got over here at Scapa Flow?
Battleships King George V, Prince of Wales,...
...battle cruiser Hood, and a few cruisers and destroyers.
The rest of the fleet's out on convoy escort.
It's from Admiral Cunningham, Sir.
"Situation in Crete is deteriorating."
"German airborne troops have captured Maleme Airfield."
Why is it we never get our bad medicine in small doses?
Perfect timing for an enemy breakout in the North Atlantic.
Cunningham and his fleet busy down here in Crete.
Sommerville's got his hands full trying to reinforce Malta with Force H.
Scharnhorst and Gneisenau are up here at Brest ready to come out again.
We must keep them covered.
And 16 convoys to guard, scattered all over the Atlantic.
If we had a hundred more ships, we still wouldn't have enough.
Sir, we've just had a signal from our agent in Norway.
The message is incomplete.
"Sighted two enemy ships off
Kristiansand at 0335 sailing due west,"
"...Cruiser Prinz Eugen and..."
The transmission stopped abruptly at that point, Sir.
- Did you try to get him back?
- Yes, Sir. No further contact.
Where is Kristiansand?
Off here, Sir. Southern tip of Norway.
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?
I don't think this man would have transmitted in the circumstances...
...if it hadn't been something really important.
Then we'll proceed on the assumption that it's Bismarck.
May I suggest we put Coastal Command to work on air reconnaissance?
By all means. Everything from Bergen southwards.
Tell them to photograph everything that looks suspicious.
I'll talk to Commander-in-Chief at Scapa Flow.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Excuse me, Sir.
First Sea Lord on the line, Sir.
Commander-in-Chief, Sir.
- Hello, Jack. How are you?
- I'm fine.
Those two German ships were sighted off southern Norway at 0335.
One is the Prinz Eugen... and we're not sure about the other.
Do you think it's...
I suggest you proceed on the worst possible assumption...
...that it's Bismarck and she's trying to breaking out.
Allright.
I may be wrong, but I can't think of anything worse at the moment.
Yes, I agree. We can't let that ship get loose in the Atlantic.
I'll come to immediate notice for steam, Sir.
All right. Good-bye.
We're directed to assume that it's Bismarck accompanied by Prinz Eugen...
...and that they're attempting to break out into the convoy lanes.
Now, gentlemen, they'd have four available passages, wouldn't they?
Here's the Denmark Strait, the passage south of Iceland,...
...the Faeroes-Shetland Passage, and the Fair Island Channel...
...between the Orkneys and the Shetlands.
Anyone care to place a bet?
What about the Iceland-Faeroes Channel?
Not too near our bases, and a plenty a room to maneuver.
Why wouldn't he take the nearest exit?
Fair Island Channel, is only a few hundred miles.
Much too close to our air patrol.
You're of no help to me, gentlemen. All you're saying is it could be any one of the four.
Actually, of course, you're perfectly right.
And I'm afraid somehow or other we've got to guard them all.
Have we any idea where they are now, Sir?
Nothing definite.
Jenkins, check with Coastal Command that they're still carrying out a search.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Looks like two cruisers.
That's what the pilot said.
One's a cruiser, all right.
The other one's...
...Bismarck.
- Bismarck's been located in Norway.
- Definitely identified.
Bismarck's in Grimstad Fjord.
They want us to send everything we've got.
Bombers, torpedo planes, everything.
- How was it?
- No luck. Nothing.
- Visibility down to nil.
- Cloud down to 200 feet, Sir.
You can't get a bombing run in weather like that.
We came in as low as we could,
200 feet along the fjord here.
- What convoy's that, Miss Jackson?
- O.G.62, Sir.
Right.
Now, Miss Davis, take the Arethusa from
O.G.62, and put her with the Home Fleet.
Good.
Now take the Victorious from that convoy forming up in the Clyde... W.S.8.B....
...and put her with the Home Fleet.
Sir, Operations Home Fleet calling.
Director of Operations.
No, I'm sorry. We still have no information.
Well, the weather's closed in over there and the aircraft can't see a thing.
Yes, as soon... as soon as
I hear, right. Right. I will.
Now...
...take the Repulse from W.S.8.B and put her with the Home Fleet.
Right.
Home Fleet looks better now, doesn't it?
Yes, Sir, but I wouldn't give much for the convoy.
You do recall that's a troop convoy, don't you, Sir?
Yes, I do.
They've got a long way to go round the cape to the Middle East.
This leaves them with almost no protection at all, Sir.
I'm quite aware of the circumstances, Miss Davis.
In my opinion this is a risk we have to take.
We have to take, Sir?
Well, Shepard.
What do you have in mind?
I think we must reinforce the Home Fleet, Sir.
We can't expect them to patrol everything from here to Greenland...
...with what they've got now.
Well, where do we get the ships?
We'd have to take ships from other duty.
It would involve some risk.
We could take Victorious and Repulse off escort duty.
That would give the Commander-in-Chief an aircraft carrier and another battle cruiser.
What convoy were they covering?
The W.8.S.B., sailing from the Clyde tomorrow.
It's a large troop convoy, Sir... 20,000 men.
We'd be exposing them to a long and dangerous voyage without proper escort.
Is that what you're recommending?
Yes, Sir.
You're willing to gamble the lives of 20,000 men?
I think there's a difference between a gamble and a calculated risk.
Good for you, Shepard.
Of course, I realize it's...
It's not an easy decision to make.
The important ones never are.
All right, go ahead and detach those two ships from the convoy.
- Inform Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
They're giving us Victorious and Repulse.
Now we can send Hood and Prince of Wales out...
...to support the patrols in the Greenland area.
- I want them ready to sail within an hour.
- Yes, Sir.
The Prince of Wales has civilian workers aboard.
They're making adjustments to the gun turrets.
If they finish on time, have them put ashore. If not, they'll sail with the ship.
Aye-aye, Sir.
As far as the rest of the fleet concerned, we'll wait here for definite information.
I suppose my nerves can stand it if yours can.
I've just talked to Captain
Shepard in London, Sir.
He says the visibility over the coast of Norway is absolutely nil.
She may still be there. She may have sailed hours ago.
What's the latest forecast?
Pretty bad, I'm afraid, Sir. It looks like two days of very thick weather.
The weather report is very good, Admiral.
Two days of heavy overcast.
Good news, is it not so, Captain?
It is, Sir.
Thank you, Bernhardt.
We have a most interesting chess game here, Lindemann.
The important moves this time are at the opening.
To break out into the Atlantic will not be easy, Sir.
Yes, but we have the advantage,...
...because they do not know what we are going to do.
We can move out immediately or we can hide for a while under this beautiful overcast.
Also, we have a choice of four different exits.
Group North has suggested the Iceland-Faeroes Passage.
You're not forgetting that, Sir?
We have to take orders from Group North.
- We do not have to take suggestions.
- Yes, Sir.
Lindemann, we have a great opportunity here.
I do not intend to let Group North or anyone else lose it for me.
There can be great glory in this voyage.
Glory for the Third Reich.
Glory for us!
- For you, Sir. You are the fleet commander.
- I will see that you are not forgotten.
I was forgotten after the last war.
Until the Führer came to power,
I got no recognition, no promotion.
I was ignored, just as Germany was ignored.
The world only remembers the winners, Lindemann.
We must make sure this time that it will remember us.
- I am sure it will.
- How soon can you get under way?
I can have steam in half an hour, Sir.
Captain, I want to be out of here in 15 minutes.
- Very well, Sir.
- Signal Prinz Eugen.
Very well, Sir.
Sir, it's a signal from the
Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.
An aircraft from Hatston's got through to Grimstad.
There's nothing there now, Sir. Nothing at all.
Well, they've sailed.
At least we know that much.
Now we can get moving.
- Position of all convoys, Sir.
- Thank you.
All we can do now is wait and see what happens.
That's the worst part of our job... The waiting.
By the way, you have a son in the service, haven't you?
Yes, Sir. He's at Gibraltar.
He's an air gunner in the Ark Royal.
I bet you're glad he won't be mixed up in this Bismarck show.
Why should I be glad?
If you were, you wouldn't admit it, would you? Even to me.
He's serving with a fleet. He must take his chance like everybody else.
I see.
There's an air vice marshal coming in later to help out on reconnaissance.
- Give him a briefing, will you?
- Very good, Sir.
You wanted to speak to the crew, Captain?
- They've been alerted.
- Yes, Sir.
Achtung!
Captain Lindemann.
With your permission, I would like to address the ship's company.
As you wish, Sir.
Thank you.
Officers and men of the Bismarck, this is the fleet commander.
I can now tell you that we are going out into the North Atlantic...
...to attack the British convoy system.
We are going to sink their ships until they no longer dare to let them sail.
It's true we are only two ships, but the world has never seen such ships.
You are sailing in the largest,...
...the most powerful battleship afloat, superior to anything in the British Navy.
We are faster, we are unsinkable, and we are German!
You cadet officers, you were selected the highest authority to make this voyage.
When you return to the fleet, you will have many inspiring stories to tell,...
...stories of German sea power, stories of Nazi victory!
To all of you, I say this never forget that you are Germans, never forget that you are Nazis!
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!
In the center, the main plot.
What's that?
- Another convoy, Sir.
- Fine. Carry on.
Now, Sir,...
...over here, we have the Hood and the Prince of Wales.
They left Scapa Flow 40 hours ago.
Here we have the Repulse,...
...the aircraft carrier Victorious, and the King George V.
They've been steaming for approximately 18 hours.
In this area,...
...the cruisers Arethusa,
Manchester, Birmingham.
In the Denmark Strait, the cruisers "Suffolk" and "Norfolk".
As you can see, Sir,...
...our cruiser screen is spread out much too thinly.
Now, if your people would get into the air...
Can't fly reconnaissance missions in weather like this.
We realize that, of course, Sir.
We must assume that the "Bismarck," in company with the Prinz Eugen,...
...is going to attempt a breakthrough to the North Atlantic.
But we don't know where and we don't know when.
If it's here...
...or here...
...then the "Repulse", and the "Victorious" and the "K.G. V" will have to do the job.
If it's here in the Denmark Strait,...
...then the "Hood" and the "Prince of Wales" will have to go after her.
I should think they could handle it very nicely.
Well, Sir, Hood's a great ship.
So is the Prince of Wales.
But she's fresh from the builder's yard.
No training for her crew.
In fact, in this emergency...
...she had to put to sea with some of contractor's workmen still on board.
The Bismarck's a tough proposition for any two ships.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
The First Sea Lord can see you now.
- Oh, good. Thank you very much, Shepard.
- A pleasure, Sir.
Yes, Sir.
Right, Sir.
Yes, I will.
Commander Richards, who's your relief?
- Dexter, Sir.
- He's late, isn't he?
A little. I don't mind, Sir.
Well, I do. Tell him I'll require him for duty the next three nights.
My dearest Tom...
Come in.
Thought you might like a cup of tea, Sir, long as you're not going to take any rest.
What are you doing here, Miss Davis?
I thought you're off duty.
Third Officer Simpson's down with flu. I'm just filling in.
Oh, thank you. Would you file that for me, please?
There's an air raid going on up top.
A Bad one?
No, not very.
Won't your family be worried about you?
I have no family here.
My father lives in Canada now.
I thought that surely you must be married or something.
No, Sir. Nothing at all.
Doesn't that seem a little odd, if you don't mind my saying so?
I was going to be married last year, but... It didn't work out.
His fault or yours?
He was at Dunkirk, and he was listed as missing in action.
It was just a year ago.
A year ago next week.
He was a rather wonderful man,...
...not... brilliant or dashing or anything like that, but... just rather wonderful.
I'm sorry.
Actually, I think it helps to talk about these things, don't you, Sir?
No, I don't. As a matter of fact
I don't think it helps at all.
Getting emotional about things is a peacetime luxury.
In wartime, it's much too painful.
You can't turn off your emotions just because there's a war on.
- You can't do anything about your feelings.
- Yes, you can.
- Director of Operations.
- Tell you why I called, Jonathan.
Dexter's here in my office... and he has rather a special problem.
I understand you've given him extra duty.
Yes, that's quite correct.
I said I'll require him for duty the next three nights.
It seems that his girl is an army nurse...
...and she's got orders to sail tomorrow night from Portsmouth.
I'm very sorry that Dexter's young lady is going overseas, but surely, that's beside the point.
Can't you make an exception?
No, Sir. I'm not prepared to make an exception for this officer or any other, for that matter...
...certainly not for reasons of personal convenience.
Well, it's very simple, Sir,... either you have discipline or you haven't.
Well, I'm sorry, Dexter.
Thank you, Sir.
By the way, Jonathan, there's a fleet commander aboard the Bismarck.
- Yes. Admiral Gunther Lutjens.
- Lutjens.
You know this man?
Yes, Sir, I do.
One of his cruisers sank my ship.
Oh. Then you'll have a special interest in him.
Commander Richards, have a bunk made up in my office.
Yes, Sir.
I want the latest report on all shipping in the North Atlantic,
- enemy, friendly, neutral.
- Yes.
Is there any air reconnaissance yet over this area?
No. The weather's still too bad.
You show two cruisers in the Denmark Strait.
Is Suffolk back on station?
We assume she is, but we don't know for certain.
She's quiet as a tomb.
- Alter course to 1-9-0.
- Starboard 15.
Starboard 15, Sir.
Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. Very good, Sir.
Bloody fool!
This blasted fog.
It's like looking into a cake of ice. I can't see a thing.
If you see something out there, it will have 15-inch guns on it.
A solid foot of armour plate, that's what the Bismarck's got.
- Who said so?
- The gunnery officer, that's who.
He said for all the good our guns'd do, we might as well throw crumpets at her.
I wish someone would throw a crumpet at me.
Ship bearing green 4-5!
Two ships bearing green 4-5!
Hard aport! Full ahead both!
Hard aport. Full ahead both, Sir.
Shall we follow them, Sir?
- Steady on 1-3-0.
- Steady on 1-3-0!
- Yeoman.
- Sir.
Make to admiralty.
"Bismarck and cruiser sighted."
"Course... south."
"My position..."
Give latitude and longitude.
Get that off immediately in case we run into trouble.
Aye-aye, Sir.
- Check radar.
- Check your radar plot.
Enemy report from Suffolk, Sir.
They've found her. Picked her up in the Denmark Strait.
Bismarck and a heavy cruiser.
66-45 north...
...26 west.
There, gentlemen.
Course southwest.
Now things are looking up.
- Tell the First Sea Lord immediately.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Good job we've got some heavy stuff in the area.
Richards, let me have an intercepting course for Hood and Prince of Wales.
- Yes
- Sir, this one's from the Norfolk.
Norfolk's there, too, Sir.
She's with Suffolk.
They're shadowing in thick fog, using radar.
I hope that radar works better than usual.
If she decided to turn on them, she could blow them both out of the water.
No. Lutjens is too clever for that.
He'd rather shake off a pair of cruisers than stop to sink them.
Course to intercept Bismarck is 3-1-0.
That would bring Hood in contact... just about... There.
Just about here, Sir.
The intercepting course is 3-1-0 degrees.
At full speed, we should make contact at 0300.
I don't want to engage him until daylight.
Give me a course and speed to intercept at dawn.
Aye-aye, Sir.
At 27 knots... Course 2-9-5,... we should meet them at first light.
- We'll proceed on that course at that speed.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
- Pass the word to Prince of Wales.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Anything further, Sir?
Signal from flag, Sir.
Speed... 27 knots.
200 revolutions.
- 200 revolutions.
- Admiral's intentions follow, Sir.
Very good.
Wilson, tell the captain we've gone onto 27 knots.
- Also, the admiral's sending his intentions.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Oh, Wilson, how are the civilian workers enjoying themselves?
They're loving every moment of it, Sir.
I'll tell you one thing, I'm not sleeping in one of these bloody hammocks.
Make a note,
Walter to speak to the captain.
We'll have double beds put in.
Oh, very funny.
Well, I reckon it's a diabolical liberty.
I believe, I never even had a chance to phone my wife to say what was happening.
They were afraid she might not let you go.
- I'm just Imagine what she thinks I'm up to.
- Pity she's wrong, isn't it?
She'll never believe this.
Where are we going? that's what I want to know.
A couple minutes ago, we picked up speed.
What's that for in the middle of the night?
Captain speaking.
Bismarck has been sighted in Denmark Strait.
She's on her way out into the Atlantic.
And we plan to tackle her about dawn tomorrow morning.
You'll be going to action stations shortly after midnight.
So get all the rest you can before then.
I'm confident tomorrow is going to be a big day for us.
Good luck and good shooting.
They can't do this to me.
I'm in a reserved occupation.
I never thought a thing like this would happen.
Fancy me fighting Germans on the high seas.
- Here, lad. You ever been in a battle before?
- Yeah, hundreds of times.
Don't hardly give it a thought any more.
Latest plot report, Sir.
Suffolk and Norfolk still in contact.
Hood and Prince of Wales are estimated 120 miles from Bismarck.
Should be quite a show tomorrow morning.
I know where I'd rather be.
Excuse me, Sir.
What a time for Shepard to take over.
I hope he's getting all the help he needs.
Help, Sir?
I didn't think he needed any help.
Captain Shepard is a very old friend of mine, Miss Davis.
You would be quite wrong if you judged him too harshly.
He had his ship blown from under him last year up in Norway.
This job here means promotion for him but he can't wait to get another ship.
As long as I've known Shepard, only two things matter to him.
His family and the sea.
I didn't know he had any family, Sir.
His son is an air gunner serving in the Ark Royal.
He and the boy are terribly close.
And his wife?
He hasn't spoken about her, and I haven't asked.
Signal from Commander-in-Chief,
Home Fleet. Sir.
"Suffolk and Norfolk will continue shadowing tonight."
"They will make no attempt to engage the enemy."
Right. Make to Hood and Prince of Wales.
"If enemy maintains present course and speed,..."
"...you should make contact approximately 0510."
Right, Sir.
- And, Dexter.
- Yes, Sir.
- Add to that... "Good luck".
- Very good, Sir.
I'm not strong enough for this sort of thing.
- Besides, I've got flat feet.
- Ah, shut up, Henry.
If we're gonna fight the Bismarck
I'm gonna check "Y" turret.
Yeah, and we'd better check that turbine. Come on, Henry.
Anyway, I always get seasick.
Hood and Prince of Wales are somewhere in here.
Suffolk and Norfolk... report
Bismarck and Prinz Eugen here.
If so, we shouldn't have long to wait.
- It should be getting light up there now.
- Signal from Suffolk, Sir.
"Have sighted Hood and Prince of Wales bearing southeast."
- "Distance... 15 miles."
- That means they've made it.
Good old Hood, she'll get them.
Come on, hurry up!
Come on, everyone!
Breach open!
Right gun shell!
Right gun shell!
Right gun, first half charge!
Right gun, second half charge!
Bridge.
Smoke bearing green 4-0, Sir.
Bismarck and cruiser...bearing green 4-0,...about 12 miles.
Closing fast.
Those are not cruisers.
They are battleships.
Captain, open fire on the leading ship.
Target leading ship!
Stand by to open fire!
Target leading ship!
Stand by to open fire!
Hard aport.
Open fire when you in range.
Concentrate on Bismarck.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Let me know when you're ready to engage guns
- and then we'll turn.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Tell Prince of Wales to open fire
- when she's in range.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Hard astarboard!
Shoot!
Range... 25,000.
Bearing... 300.
All turrets ready to open fire, Sir.
Open fire.
Fire!
Fire!
That was too close for comfort.
Turn 20 degrees to starboard, Captain.
Shoot!
Fire!
Unbelievable.
- Blimey.
- What happened?
The Hood's gone.
Good God.
- Yeoman.
- Yes, Sir?
Make to admiralty from Prince of Wales.
Tell them...
- Tell them the Hood has blown up.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Starboard 15.
Starboard 15, Sir.
Starboard 15.
Signal from Prince of Wales, Sir.
Well, what is it?
It says... HMS Hood has blown up.
Bring it here.
Signal from Suffolk, Sir.
Johnson.
"Hood sunk. Prince of Wales and Bismarck exchanging fire."
Fire!
Shoot.
Port 20!
Tell the engine room to give me everything they've got.
Course 2-4-0.
Very good. Course 2-4-0.
Fire!
Give me a hand!
Hard aport. Steer 1-5-0.
Make smoke.
She's badly damaged, Sir.
She's turning away and making smoke.
Do you want to pursue?
No. We have more important work to do.
Hold your course.
- Steady on present course.
- Very good, Sir.
Captain, congratulations.
It's a great moment for the German Navy.
Yes, Lindemann... and for the two of us.
This morning, HMS Hood, largest British warship, was sunk by the German...
This is London. Ed Murrow reporting.
This island, which is no stranger to bad tidings,...
...received news today that HMS Hood, the largest warship in the British fleet...
...and pride of the British Navy,...
...has been sunk by the German battleship Bismarck.
From the Hood's complement of 1,500 men, there were three survivors.
In the same engagement the battleship
Prince of Wales was badly damaged.
Two British capital ships have been put out of commission...
...and the most powerful battleship in the world is now loose on the high seas.
It remains to be seen whether British Navy has the capability at this crucial moment...
...of concentrating enough sea power to deal with the situation.
There is undoubtedly great rejoicing in
Berlin tonight and also on the Bismarck.
Here's to the ship, Lindemann, and here's to us.
We have beaten the best they have.
- Do you realize that?
- Yes, Sir.
They will never stop us, not now.
You wanted the damage control report, Sir.
What is it?
We received one hit, forward on the port side, over number two fuel tank.
- We're losing a little oil.
- Anything serious?
No, Sir. I would say the damage is very slight.
However, I would recommend we put about and have it repaired.
Put about? You mean go home?
Yes, Sir. We could refuel at the same time.
Are you mad?
We have fought our way out into the Atlantic.
- This is no time to turn and run for home.
- We wouldn't be running, Sir.
- We've won a tremendous victory.
- But it's not the victory that was ordered.
You haven't been close to the high command, Lindemann.
Do you know what will happen...
...when Admiral Raeder reports the sinking of the Hood?
The Führer will smile and everyone else will smile,...
...and then, a few moments later, he'll turn to Raeder with a scowl.
"What about the convoys, Raeder?
Have they sunk any convoys?"
There will still be plenty of convoys,
Sir, after we make repairs.
Is your ship unmaneuverable, Captain?
Are the guns damaged?
Anything out of action?
No, Sir.
Then we will push forward, as instructed by the high command.
But surely the Führer must realize...
Are you now going to tell the Führer what he must realize?
- No, Sir.
- Then do not tell me.
For the time being, we will hold our present course and speed.
Yes, Sir.
There will be no further statement to the press...
- ...not for the present.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Make a signal to admiral commanding First Cruiser Squadron.
"Suffolk and Norfolk must maintain contact..."
"...with the Bismarck, so that Home Fleet can intercept."
"Continue shadowing as long as you have fuel to do so."
- Aye-aye, Sir.
- Excuse me, Sir.
This is Bismarck's latest position, course, and speed.
Send it to the C-in-C,
Home Fleet, right away.
Now, Shepard.
At its present speed, Sir,...
...the Home Fleet cannot make contact with "Bismarck" until tomorrow,...
...and then only if she maintains her present course.
What if she doesn't maintain her present course?
That's it exactly, Sir.
- They won't make contact at all.
- Prime minister for you, Sir.
- First Sea Lord here.
- Now, First Sea Lord,...
...I want to make it unmistakably clear that there is absolutely nothing as vital...
...to the nation at this moment as the destruction of the "Bismarck"
You are authorized to employ any means at your disposal,...
...regardless of risk and regardless of the price that must be paid.
This is a battle we cannot afford to lose.
I understand, Sir.
I don't care how you do it.
You must sink the "Bismarck".
Good luck to you.
Thank you, Sir.
Well, gentlemen, any suggestions?
In my opinion, Sir, we cannot leave this entirely to the Home Fleet.
We must reach out and pull in everything we can lay our hands on.
I've ordered Rodney to leave her convoy. She was the last available ship.
I don't suggest this lightly, Sir.
Down here, at Gibraltar, we've Force H.
Renown, Sheffield, Ark Royal.
We can't strip the Western Mediterranean with this Crete business going on.
Perhaps if we left Ark Royal down there and sent the other two out.
No, Sir.
We may need Ark Royal's aircraft.
What do you think, A.C.N.S.?
It's taking a serious risk.
I know Shepard has weighed that very carefully.
In view of what the prime minister said, we don't seem to have much choice.
Well, I may be able to argue with you two, but I can't quarrel with the prime minister.
Order Force H to sail at the earliest possible moment.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Johnson.
Smith.
It's not for you, boy.
Stratton.
Singer.
Shepard.
Oh, thanks.
- Thompson. Thompson, where are you?
- That's me.
My dearest Tom,...
...I'm really much too tired to write, but I think of you so very often...
...that I'm always afraid there may be things I will forget to mention.
Marvelous. No letter again.
Well, where are we off to this time?
That's what I'd like to know.
Hey, Tom, is it true your father is director of operations?
Yeah, I'm afraid it is.
He's got a nerve, moving us out of Gibraltar.
Just when we get fixed up with a couple of girls.
Why don't you drop him a line, Tom?
Tell him we don't want to go to sea.
It's my fault, really. I thought you blokes would like a couple months in England.
- You said England?
- You're kidding?
Not at all. You see, my girl's in London.
That's what gave me the idea.
You mean to say you asked your father if
They wouldn't dare. Well, not in wartime.
Go on.
Your father would do the same for you.
This is the captain.
I thought you'd be interested to know...
...we shall be operating in the Atlantic for a while.
We've got orders to go out after the Bismarck... and we should engage.
- No! No! Boys!
- Grab him!
If Bismarck holds her present course and speed,...
...when's the earliest we can engage her?
Nine o'clock tomorrow morning, Sir, at best possible speed.
If Norfolk and Suffolk can keep track of her, they can guide us in.
Suppose Bismarck gives them the slip?
If she shakes off those cruisers during the night,...
...if we lose contact, we may never get hold of her again.
She's got the weather on her side, Sir.
Looks very bad for tonight.
We've got to try and slow her down before nightfall.
Sommers, do you think Victorious could launch an air strike?
Well, she's supposed to get her deck landing training in Mediteranian, Sir.
Most of her pilots have never flown off a carrier.
I'm afraid they'll have to start their training now.
Detach Victorious from the fleet.
Tell her to close Bismarck at 30 knots, and she's to launch an air strike as soon as she gets within 100 miles of the enemy.
Aye-aye, Sir.
That's all, gentlemen.
Signal Prinz Eugen that she is to proceed on her course...
- ...and make for Brest.
- Yes, Sir.
We will keep the enemy cruisers occupied until Prinz Eugen is out of sight.
All right, Captain, you can make your turn.
- Hard aport.
- Hard aport, Sir.
Stand by to open fire.
Radar plot, range decreasing.
Decreasing very rapidly.
Range down to 22,000 yards.
Doubled back on us, Sir!
There she is, Sir!
Hard aport. Full ahead both.
Hard aport!
Make smoke.
Make smoke. Full ahead both.
Signal to Prinz Eugen.
"Good-bye and good hunting."
- That's all, Becker.
- Very good, Sir.
Cease fire, Captain.
Cease fire.
Cease fire, Sir.
Signal to Group West.
"Prinz Eugen successfully detached and proceeding independently."
"Have been unable to shake off enemy cruisers because of radar."
"Will attempt to break away during the night."
- Thank you, Mueller.
- Very good, Sir.
All right, Captain, you may resume your original course.
- Starboard 20.
- Starboard 20.
Starboard 20.
Contact!
There she is... Starboard beam.
Hard astarboard!
What is it?
All right.
- One hit on the port bow, Sir.
- What is the damage?
Very slight, Sir, and no one wounded.
We will have the damage repaired in a few hours.
That is good. That is good.
- Lindemann.
- Yes, Sir.
If there were submarines in this area, we would zigzag, wouldn't we?
Of course, Sir.
And the cruisers following us would be obliged to do the same.
- Yes, Sir, but I would...
- Captain,
I want you to set a zigzag pattern.
Hold speed at 20 knots.
In exactly two hours we shall stop zigzagging
...and proceed at full speed in whatever direction we're headed.
We will be out of radar range before they realize that they have lost us.
This hit Victorious claims it hasn't slowed Bismarck down at all.
I know, Sir. She's been zigzagging now for more than two hours.
That's odd.
She must know we haven't any submarines in the area.
I wonder if Victorious can get off another strike tonight.
- I'm afraid not. It's too dark now.
- Signal from Norfolk, Sir.
Yes?
What is it?
Sir, they've...
They've lost contact with Bismarck.
This is London.
Over 24 hours have passed...
...since the battleship Bismarck destroyed HMS Hood.
It is reported that the British have attacked the Bismarck...
...with aircraft from a carrier, but Berlin says the attack was beaten off successfully.
Berlin adds that Bismarck was able subsequently...
...to shake off the surface vessels pursuing her.
The German battleship has survived...
...the heaviest guns and ships in the British Navy, and the gloomy speculation now is,
...that the British Navy may have trouble finding her, let alone destroying her.
Of one thing we can be sure...
...the lights will burn late in the admiralty tonight.
This is her last known position,... and this... her farthest on.
That means she has to be somewhere inside that circle.
In this sector, search aircraft from Victorious.
To the south and west, the cruisers Suffolk and Norfolk.
That leaves two possibilities.
Either she's broken back to Germany or she's headed for one of the French ports.
Now, Miss Davis.
If you were Bismarck, what would you do?
Well, I suppose I'm not very brave.
I'd head for home, Sir.
And a very sensible thing to do, too.
Plenty of fuel, good repair facilities, complete protection.
But not Lutjens or any other
German fleet commander.
Why not?
Because in Nazi Germany, he'd lose face.
I've fought these people before.
They have to prove their superiority every day.
- That's their one tremendous weakness.
- Sir.
- Yes?
- Signal from the Commander-in-Chief.
"King George V running short of fuel."
"Can't maintain full speed much longer."
Supposing she is heading for a French port.
It won't be long before she gets friendly submarine support and complete air cover.
Too late to stop her then.
Scharnhorst and Gneisenau at Brest.
Supposing Bismarck joins up with them...
...and all three of them decide to come out together.
What then?
What's the trouble?
He just collapsed, Sir. I think he's got a temperature.
Take him in the office.
Why is this man on duty if he's sick?
I don't know, Sir. He didn't report sick.
Ring the sick bay and get someone over here.
Aye-aye, Sir. Simms, take over.
- All right. Leave him here.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Sorry about this, Sir.
If you had a temperature, why the devil didn't you report sick?
I'm sorry, Sir.
I didn't want to miss anything.
All right, Brown. We'll get you along to the sick bay.
If anything happens, I'll let you know.
Thank you, Sir.
What time is it, Miss Davis?
- About 6:30, Sir.
- Morning or evening?
It's a very fine morning, and I think you should go on up and take a short walk.
You haven't been outside for five days.
Take down this message for
Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet.
"Our interpretation of best available information..."
"...indicates Bismarck heading for the coast of France."
Proceed accordingly.
Excuse me, Sir, but do you have to stick your neck out quite so far?
I'm afraid that goes with the job.
Make to admiral commanding Force H.
"Proceed to intercept Bismarck, on assumption she's headed for Brest."
"Suggest search by aircraft from Ark Royal."
Your son is in Ark Royal, isn't he, Sir?
Yes, yes. Yes, he is.
- Get that off immediately, will you?
- Yes.
Come in.
Come in, Miss Davis.
Signal for you, Sir.
Thank you.
This is a report on the
Ark Royal's air search.
They haven't found a thing.
- Better tell Captain Shepard.
- Yes, Sir.
Also, two of Ark Royal's aircraft failed to return to the carrier.
No need to tell him that,
- I should think it can't do any good.
- No, Sir.
By the way, how would you like a trip to America?
America, Sir?
The admiralty's sending a mission to discuss a master plot for convoys.
Two regular officers and a Wren officer.
The board picked you as first choice.
It sounds very exciting.
There will be no change, of course...
...until this Bismarck thing is settled, then talk to Captain Shepard.
Aye-aye, Sir. And thank you very much.
Yes, it would have to be long-range aircraft, Catalinas, I should think.
Yes, that's right. Call me back.
- Shepard.
- Sir?
It seems to me our forces are very heavily committed to a single course of action.
Is that based on the definite knowledge that Bismarck is headed for one of the French port?
On definite knowledge? No, Sir.
It's based on my summing up of the general situation.
I felt it was a decision that had to be made.
I hope you're right, Shepard.
I hope to God you're right.
A report from Ark Royal, Sir. they haven't found anything.
All right.
Are you off now, Miss Davis?
Yes, Sir. My watch ends at seven o'clock.
Alright, I seem to have a devil of a lot of work to do.
Do you think you could stay an hour and help me out?
Of course, Sir. I have a dinner date, but that's not until nine o'clock.
Good. Let me have the latest information on the available of aircraft in Force H.
Aye-aye, Sir.
"Coastal command will activate two crossover air patrols."
"The northern-most will cover possible enemy courses from Brest to La Rochelle."
The southern-most will cover
La Rochelle to Cape Finisterre."
Good. Now, if you'll coordinate that with Coastal Command,...
...I'll get on with the business of Force H...
...then you can run along and enjoy your dinner date.
What, at half past one in the morning, Sir?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I had no idea what time it was.
By the way, Miss Davis.
I'd like to make arrangements for you to work with me full-time, if you think you could face it.
What I had in mind was to take you off your present duties and make you my assistant.
I appreciate you thinking of me, Sir.
I need someone who's intelligent and dependable.
Quite honestly, someone like yourself.
Well... What do you say?
I don't know quite what to say, Sir.
I... I'd make an effort not to be so rude...
...as I have been in the past, if that's what's bothering you.
It isn't anything like that.
If you want to say no, please say so.
Well, you see...
Director of Operations.
One moment, please, Sir.
It's Captain Farnum... Casualty Section.
Hello, Richard. Yes?
What sort of bad news?
Is there no other information?
I see.
Yes. I appreciate your telling me.
Thank you, Richard.
My son's missing.
His plane ran out of fuel and failed to return.
I'm terribly sorry, Sir.
There's a good chance he'll be picked up.
You were picked up.
When I got out of hospital,... all I could think about was getting back to London.
I wanted to see my wife.
I took a taxi from Waterloo.
As I drove into Welbeck Place, everything looked so familiar.
Every house was just as I remembered it.
Every house except mine.
There was a large black hole in the ground where my house had been.
Uh... Where my wife had been?
I didn't think it was possible to feel such pain.
I know.
I've been through it myself, and I know.
I swore that night...
I'd never again get emotionally attached to a human being as long as I lived... but I made one mistake.
I forgot about... I forgot about my son.
You can't avoid pain by fencing yourself off.
Sometimes you need the help of other people more than anything else.
But you have to let them get close enough to help.
I don't want any help.
I found when I was deeply troubled that I needed people very badly.
People want to be needed.
I found that out, too.
We're in business again.
Bismarck's been spotted by a Catalina flying boat, headed for Brest.
Your hunch was right, Sir.
Excuse me.
Sir, Captain Shepard has offered me a new job, to be his assistant.
I'd like very much to take it.
I hope you'll have no objection.
Jonathan, what have you done to that girl?
She's just been offered a marvelous opportunity...
...to go to America.
It means sure promotion.
Now she's turning all that down just to stay here with you. I don't understand it.
Here's the situation. The flying boat spotted Bismarck at 1030 and has been shadowing ever since using cloud cov...
Jonathan.
I'm sorry, Sir.
- You were saying,...
- The flying boat spotted Bismarck at 1030 and has been shadowing ever since using cloud cover.
From time to time, "Bismarck" has put up very heavy anti-aircraft fire.
By now, the British know where we are.
They'll send out everything they have.
We can sink anything they send out.
What was your latest fuel report?
We've lost about 200 tons from the tanks that were damaged.
- We have 35 percent left.
- That is more than enough.
I want to check the plot.
- Becker.
- Yes, Sir.
- Keep me informed about the fuel situation.
- I will, Sir.
I've requested air cover from the Luftwaffe.
How soon can we expect them to be with us?
Shore-based aircraft can operate approximately that far from the coast, Sir.
We will arrive at that point about dawn tomorrow.
What about King George and Rodney?
What is their position now?
Based on reports from Group West,
I have them plotted 200 miles to the north of us, Sir.
That is good.
They cannot possibly overtake us now.
A day or so in Brest to make repairs and then we come out again with our tanks full.
Also, Lindemann...
I have an idea.
Suppose Scharnhorst and
Gneisenau came out with us.
We would be the most powerful fleet that ever sailed.
Nothing in the world could touch us.
Excuse me, Sir. Personal signal for the fleet commander.
Thank you, Mueller.
"Best wishes on your birthday."
Look.
Adolf Hitler.
This is a great honor.
Yes, please. Right.
Here are the fuel consumption reports for...
...K.G.V. and Rodney, Sir, as close as I can calculate them.
- Don't look too good, do they?
- No, Sir.
They're 140 miles astern of Bismarck.
Can they steam at full speed long enough to overtake her?
If they did, Sir, they wouldn't have enough fuel to get home.
Sir.
By daylight tomorrow, Bismarck will be in range of German air cover.
They'll send out the whole
Luftwaffe to their bearing.
- And a line of U-boats as well.
- Well, we have to slow her down by tonight...
...so Home Fleet can overtake her before she gets into friendly waters.
Well, Renown and Sheffield can't do it.
That leaves... Ark Royal.
Ten hours of daylight left.
Call it nine and a half.
There's time to get off one air strike anyway, with luck, they might get off two.
Yes, Sir.
We'd better get in touch with Ark Royal.
Your torpedoes have been fitted with the new magnetic exploders,...
...so you should get very good results.
You have Bismarck's position, course, and speed.
She's now 24 miles away, bearing 183 degrees.
You can't mistake her.
She's all by herself, so make your attack immediately.
Oh, there's just one final word.
The Home Fleet's 100 miles astern.
Unless you stop Bismarck today, they'll never catch up her.
It's up to you, gentlemen. Good day.
The Sheffield's been detached from the flagship, Sir.
She was ordered to close
Bismarck and shadow her.
How long ago?
This was sent an hour and a half ago, Sir.
An hour and a half?
It wasn't decoded immediately, Sir, because it wasn't addressed to us.
We just happened to pick it up, Sir.
Our pilots have orders to attack any ship alone in that area.
Get down below and send a message to all aircraft.
"Look out for Sheffield."
Send it in plain language and getting it off, immediately.
Aye-aye, Sir.
Bit of a cockup somewhere.
It's the Bismarck, all right!
It's all right. They're ours... Swordfish.
Sounds as if they're going to fly right over us, Sir.
They're using our position to get their bearings.
I can see them now, Sir. There they are.
They're attacking us!
- Full ahead both! Hard aport!
- Full ahead both.
- All guns, hold your fire!
- Aye-aye, Sir.
Torpedo exploded as it hit the water, Sir.
There's another one.
They're exploding short.
What's the matter with those?
It's those damn magnetic exploders.
Here comes one that didn't explode, Sir.
- Hard astarboard.
- Hard astarboard.
That was the Sheffield, Sir,
It just came through from the carrier.
Signal the other aircraft.
Tell them to break off the attack.
- Wheel amidships.
- Wheel amidships, Sir.
We all feel the same about what's happened so there's no point in discussing it.
Let's just say we've learned a very important lesson...
...which may well prove a blessing in disguise.
All right, let's get on with the job.
There's still enough light for one more attack.
Think you're up to it?
Yes, but what about those magnetic exploders?
They're being changed at this moment. We'll go back to contact exploders on torpedoes.
Keep your seats, gentlemen.
I have a message here from the Commander-in-Chief.
"Unless the enemy's speed has been reduced by midnight,..."
..."King George V will have to abandon the chase and turn back for refueling."
There's no need to tell you what that means.
This is our last chance, gentlemen.
I suggest you go below and get something to eat.
You'll be taking off at 1830.
Skipper! Ship bearing green 4-5.
This is it, boys! Come on, let's go!
Hard astarboard!
- Where was that?
- The hit was on the amidships.
- No serious damage, Sir.
- Thank you, Mueller.
- Tell damage control to keep us informed.
- Yes, Sir.
- Hard astarboard!
- Hard astarboard!
Hard aport!
Captain.
Hit in the steering compartment, Sir.
- Put your rudder amidships.
- Rudder amidships.
The rudder won't move, Sir.
What ships are these?
The 4th Destroyer Flotilla, Sir.
They're getting close.
We picked up two very peculiar reports from Coastal Command...
...following the attack by Ark Royal.
The first one says, "Bismarck circling."
The second one reads,
"Bismarck heading nor-norwest."
Nor-norwest? But that's impossible, Sir.
She'd be headed straight for "K.G. V" and "Rodney."
Sounds like faulty identification.
Wrong ship, most likely.
Sir? Signal from "Sheffield."
They made contact with Bismarck.
She's steering north at 10 knots.
That's incredible!
It must be Bismarck.
But what's she doing on that course and at a speed of 10 knots?
- Hit by a torpedo, I'll bet, and damaged.
- Propellers?
Could be, Sir.
Or rudder, and can't maneuver.
We've got a chance now, Sir.
I think we've got a chance.
Yes.
It's the Bismarck, all right.
- Yeoman?
- Sir?
Make to Solent. "Intend to attack with torpedoes.
Ships turning to port.
Firing range 4,000 yards."
Aye-aye, Sir.
Bring on 30 knots.
300 revolutions.
From Captain D, Sir.
"Speed 30 knots."
"Turning to port to fire torpedoes.
Firing range 4,000 yards."
Good! Then it is the Bismarck.
Damage control.
Damage control.
Damage control, Sir.
Captain speaking. I want a report on that rudder.
The divers are down now.
They'll be up in a moment, Sir.
Range 6,000 yards, Sir.
Yes.
I see.
It's impossible to free the rudder, Sir.
It was jammed too badly by the explosion.
How early in the morning can you put a couple of divers over the side?
At first light, Sir, about five o'clock if the sea is not too rough.
I do not care about the sea.
I was thinking about the men, Sir.
Sir, from fleet commander.
Thank you.
"Group West is sending out three seagoing tugs."
"All submarines in the area have been ordered to concentrate at this point."
That is good.
That is very good.
Range 5,000.
Attention all hands. Attention all hands.
This is the fleet commander.
We are having some difficulty repairing the damage to our steering gear,
...but I assure you there is no cause for alarm.
4,500 yards, Sir.
Stand by the torpedo tubes.
Stand by the torpedo tubes.
By morning, we will be in good hands.
And if the British Home Fleet should be foolish enough to appear,
...they will be torpedoed by U-boats.
Meanwhile, let me remind you that our guns have not been damaged.
This is still the most powerful ship afloat.
I have in my hand a message addressed to the entire crew.
"All Germany is at your side."
Your gallantry is an inspiration to our people.
"You will forever occupy a place of honour in the history of the Third Reich."
This message is signed by the Führer.
Range 4,000 yards, Sir.
Port 20, fire when the sights come on.
- Two enemy destroyers on port bow, Sir.
- Alarm port.
Alarm port, Sir!
Range 4,000, bearing 300 degrees.
Guns ready port.
Guns ready port, Sir.
- Illuminate with star shell.
- Illuminate with star shell.
They've seen us!
Now we're for it!
20 degrees to go, Sir.
Fire!
All torpedoes gone, Sir.
Let's get out of here. Hard aport.
- Hard aport.
- Open fire, main armament.
- Torpedo hit amidship, Sir.
- Good man!
Fire!
She's got the Solent.
Good shooting, Lindemann.
- Cease firing!
- Cease firing!
One hit on the armor near the forward boiling room.
The damage can be repaired and it won't affect our speed, Sir.
- Thank you.
- That is good.
Destroyers are still shadowing, Sir.
They have orders to keep track of the
"Bismarck" until the Home Fleet closes.
They claim three hits with torpedoes.
It hasn't even slowed her down.
What about the reports of enemy submarines?
A.C.N.S. says these have been confirmed.
I've notified the Commander-in-Chief.
What is C-in-C doing about it?
He hasn't altered his plans.
I'd like to send him a signal telling him to be careful, but I'm sure he'd resent it.
Cigarette?
No, thank you, Sir.
- I'll be here if you want me.
- Very good, Sir.
Shepard?
Sorry about your son.
Yes, Sir.
Captain Shepard, Sir.
Excuse me, Sir.
I took in an operational signal from one of the destroyers shadowing the Bismarck.
They picked up three flyers in a rubber boat.
It must have been over an hour ago,
Sir, so I couldn't get off in time.
I heard about your son so I thought I'd tell you.
It might not be him at all,
Sir, but you never know.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Oh, Sir, A.C.N.S. has been calling you, Sir. Says it's very urgent.
- Assistant chief of staff, please.
- Yes, Sir.
Hello, Sir. Shepard here.
Jonathan, I've got the most marvelous news.
Your son is alive and well.
He's been picked up by a destroyer.
This is absolutely official. Farnum got the message half an hour ago.
Jonathan?
Don't you understand, Jonathan?
Your son is alive and well.
What did he say, Sir?
He didn't say anything.
Well, if you'll you excuse me, Sir.
Signal for Captain Shepard.
- I'll take it.
- It's from King George V.
What is it?
- They've sighted Bismarck, Sir.
- Oh! Here comes the main event.
Urgent signal for you, Sir.
Right gun load.
Right gun second half charge.
Right gun loading.
How much fuel have we got left?
We shall have to break off action in two hours, Sir.
- Main armament ready.
- Enemy speed 10 knots.
Course 3-5-0, Sir.
They outnumber us 2 to 1 and we can't do more than 10 knots.
What are you saying, Captain?
This is the Bismarck.
We still have all our guns and any moment now the Luftwaffe will arrive.
Open fire, Captain.
- Open fire.
- Fire!
- Open fire!
- Shoot!
Fire!
Shoot!
She's hit.
- Good shooting, Captain.
- Shoot!
Shoot!
Shoot!
Signal from King George V, Sir.
"Bismarck on fire amidships.
Two of her turrets out of action."
All right.
I thought I'd be cheering, Sir, at this point, but I'm afraid I can't.
I know. It's always that way.
Shoot!
Hoffman, we have to flood the forward magazines. Get the men out.
They can't, Sir.
They're trapped by the fire.
There's too much danger of blowing up. Flood them!
What about the men?
I gave an order, Hoffman!
Flood the forward magazines!
Flood the forward magazines!
Our fuel state is critical, Sir.
Get closer. Get closer.
We've got to finish her now!
Shoot!
All the guns out of action except "A" turret, Sir.
- Where is your Luftwaffe now, Sir?
- I don't understand it.
The Führer promised
He promised to send help.
They will be along any minute now. You will see.
He was proud of that.
"Tomorrow, the world."
He said that only yesterday.
He was right.
Heil Hit...
Sir, all the officers on the bridge are dead.
I have to tell you that all the guns are finished!
- Finished? Tell the men to abandon ship!
- Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
We've got her! She's finished!
The Dorsetshire has joined us, Sir.
Tell Dorsetshire to finish her off with torpedoes.
Aye-aye, Sir.
- Cease firing!
- Cease firing!
She's going.
- Yeoman.
- Sir?
Tell Dorsetshire to stand by to pick up survivors.
Aye-aye, Sir.
- Jenkins?
- Sir?
Make to admiralty.
"Bismarck is sunk.
Fleet is returning to Scapa Flow."
Aye-aye, Sir.
Well, gentlemen... let's go home.
- Shepard?
- Sir?
The prime minister would like to see us tomorrow morning at eleven o'clock.
- I assume you can make yourself available.
- Certainly, Sir.
- But why should he want to see me?
- I don't know.
He seems to think you had something to do with this operation.
- Thank you, Sir.
- Well done, Jonathan.
Thank you, Sir.
- Petty Officer Williams?
- Sir.
Take a message for
Telegraphist Brown in the sick bay.
- Tell him the Bismarck's been sunk.
- Aye-aye, Sir.
- May I offer my congratulations, too, Sir?
- Thank you.
Uh, take a message.
"Request pleasure of the company... of Second Officer Anne Davis at dinner."
Accepted.
Good.
Now, I know you must be very tired,...
...and it's nearly nine o'clock, but how about tonight?
Right now.
I'll get my things.
Great heavens.
It's nine o'clock in the morning, and I asked you out to dinner.
We could always make it breakfast, couldn't we?
Why not?
You know, Harvey, these boys worry me.
Four stripes on his arm and he don't even know what time of day it is.
-- English --
(narrator) Greece,
that hard and timeless land
where even the stones speak -
of man's courage,
of his endurance, of his glory.
And none more eloquently
than this lonely pillar in a desolate pass
some 200 miles north of modern Athens.
Across the hush of 24 centuries,
this is the story of a turning point in history.
Of a blazing day
when 300 Greek warriors fought here,
to hold with their lives
their freedom...
and ours.
At last we are in Europe.
- Mardonius.
- My lord.
How long will it be before the whole of our troops pass into Greece?
About seven days and seven nights, my lord.
Whip them on if they are slow.
I am anxious to avenge my father's defeat.
My lord, this army will give you not only Greece, but the whole world.
You are right.
It was my father's dream:
One world, one master.
But at Marathon, 10 years ago, he sent a mere wave.
I am leading an ocean!
So this is the Spartan spy caught trying to count my troops?
Yes, my lord.
All our best torture is wasted on him.
He's worn out two of my men without uttering a sound.
Bring him here.
Why do you not speak?
I have nothing to say.
Tell me, is it true that the Spartans are the bravest warriors in all Greece?
You will find that out for yourself.
Fool! You have but few men.
Your little country is divided.
You have no single ruler.
How can you defy me, the master of the whole world?
That's not for you to understand, sir.
For you are the master of slavery.
And you know nothing of freedom.
Enough!
Let us see how insolence meets death.
Seize him!
Wait!
Release him.
Come here, my friend.
I have spared your life, but not out of pity.
I am told the Greeks are holding some assembly at Corinth.
Go there, and tell them what you have seen here.
The power that neither man nor the gods can thwart.
Go!
Agathon.
Gryllus. What evil wind has blown you into this scorpions' nest?
- I am here with Demaratus.
- You are with Xerxes.
I am in his camp, but not with him.
You know, after all, Demaratus was once our king in Sparta, before he was exiled.
I'm not interested in Demaratus.
Kings have their ways, but you, you are in the camp of our enemies, and therefore an enemy of Greece.
- You know my son Phylon in Sparta?
- Yes.
Please give him a message from me. Tell him not to judge me until he knows all the...
That Greek spy, this morning.
He was a brave man.
He was a Spartan, my lord.
Demaratus, you were once king of those people.
Tell me, do you really believe that Sparta will fight?
Do you wish for a truthful answer or an agreeable one?
- Tell me the truth. I shan't hold it against you.
- Sparta will fight, even if the rest submit.
How can they do anything together when they have two kings ruling them?
The one who stole my throne is a usurper, but the other, Leonidas, is a true Spartan king.
His name means "lion", and he lives up to it.
There is no man who can match him in courage and skill in battle.
Nor in devotion to his country.
You seem to have great regard for Spartan kings, Demaratus.
I have, my lord. I was one myself.
Yet you do not look to me like a formidable fighter.
I have never yet met the man
I could not master.
I'll give you a chance to prove your words.
I have in my bodyguard a remarkable young man.
I've seen him kill four good swordsmen with as many thrusts - just for displeasing me with their bragging words.
Now you can prove your boast.
Hurry. Hurry.
Argh!
(woman screams)
Once again, Demaratus, you've succeeded in spoiling my dinner.
My lord.
- Artemisia.
- May I enter this war council?
By all means.
My ships have just dropped anchor.
Five vessels, fully fitted and manned.
This is a pleasant surprise, Artemisia.
I expected your ships, but not you yourself.
If my men fight, I want to be with them. That's the least a queen can do for her subjects.
To watch them die for her? I never deny my subjects that pleasure. Come, sit with me.
Artemisia, queen of Halicarnassus.
We visited her city last year and the great king sought her advice about the war.
I'm glad to have you with me, Artemisia.
Everyone gives me different advice.
Artabanus, to abandon this war.
Mardonius, to conquer the whole world.
And Demaratus, to seek peace with the Spartans.
Only because I know my people well.
I can always predict their actions.
Even when they choose to discard one of their kings?
Will you forgive me, my lord?
I do not relish the noble lady's wit.
It has served me well, Demaratus.
At least I'm still with my people.
And still a queen.
Well spoken, Artemisia. I've tried to curb his arrogance with the wrong weapon.
A woman's tongue is deadlier than the sword.
Why do you permit him to remain here?
He may serve my purpose.
The Greeks are assembled at Corinth to discuss my demands.
Above all, I don't want them to unite.
Once they disagree among themselves, men like Demaratus may be of great use to me.
To us, you mean.
Yes.
I need your advice, too.
Come tonight, Artemisia.
Will you come?
Only if you promise to limit our discussions... to the Corinth assembly.
As I said before, the independence of our cities is the cornerstone of our freedom.
Therefore I propose that each city deal with this problem independently.
Without surrendering its dignity.
But also... without futile heroics which can only end in the mass suicide of the Greek race.
(muttering)
Silence! Silence!
We shall now hear from the representative of Athens, Themistocles.
10 years ago, the father of the present king of Persia invaded Greece at Marathon.
On that occasion, the Athenians rose to challenge him.
Our Spartan friends, famed for their piety no less than their military prowess, volunteered help, but were delayed by, if I remember correctly, a religious festival.
Whereupon the Athenians, unaided, outnumbered ten to one, attacked the invader and threw him into the sea.
We've no time for history now.
Things are different today.
Yes. Things are different today.
Today the danger is much greater.
The whole of Asia is descending upon us.
Many times more men than there are Greeks.
These men are fierce, savage, bloodthirsty, merciless.
But that is not the reason why we should fear them. That is not the source of their power.
Their power lies in their unity.
Unity.
Remember that one terrible word which will surely destroy Greece unless we counter it with a unity of our own.
A unity of free men fighting together, resisting this united tide of tyranny.
We all know Themistocles to be a master of words.
But before we allow ourselves to be led by them, let us consider some other words that have been spoken.
Has Athens not sent for and received a prediction from the Delphic oracle?
Come now, Themistocles.
No Greek state acts without first consulting the gods.
Why not reveal this prediction to us, instead of trying to draw us into a hopeless war?
There are no hopeless wars, friend.
Only hopeless cowards.
You are evading the answer.
I happen to know this prediction by heart.
And here it is.
"Fly to the world's end, doomed ones.
Leave your homes."
"For fire and the headlong god of war shall bring you low."
This clearly seems to me that the gods foretell the doom of Athens.
Isn't it wonderful that we have among us such a clever man?
Not only does he know how to steal state secrets, but he understands the meaning of the gods as well.
Now, since the sacred text has been filched, there's no longer any point in keeping it a secret.
Here is the rest of the prediction.
"Then far-seeing Jove grants this to the prayers of Athene:
Safe shall the wooden wall continue for thee and thy children."
Perhaps you can explain to us the meaning of these words.
- They have no meaning.
- No meaning?
Do you infer then the gods dispense nonsense?
Don't put words into my mouth to confuse the issue.
You know no wooden walls can stand against an army like Xerxes'.
And anyway, Athens no longer has a wooden wall.
And where did you steal this piece of information?
Has it a wooden wall now?
Answer me. Yes or no?
- Yes.
- A wooden wall?
A splendid one. I know how splendid because I've supervised its building.
Our new Athenian ships, manned by the bravest sailors in the world.
There is our wooden wall.
The wall far-seeing Jove declares shall keep us safe.
The gods don't lie.
Shall we not heed their words, rather than listen to fools, thieves, and blasphemous cowards?
- This is an insult!
- Following divine advice,
Athens shall fight to her victory.
A victory she invites all Greece to join.
Speak, friend.
I represent Phocis.
We are a small state.
We can field but 1,000 soldiers.
Who will help us if we fight?
Will Sparta come to our defence?
(men) Sparta! Sparta!
The delegate from Phocis asks the vital question.
Athens has ships, but Sparta has the finest army in Greece.
Sir, is it not fitting that we now hear from the representative of Sparta?
King Leonidas of Sparta.
A Spartan king cannot act without the authority of his people.
But I know my people.
And I know they will fight.
Will they lead all others?
Sparta will fight whether others will follow or not.
- Sir.
- Yes?
You will hear words never before uttered in the history of our country.
Athens, to prove her trust in Spartan valour, does hereby resign her claim to naval leadership, and places her ships under Spartan command.
From this day onward, every Athenian ship will sail under Spartan orders.
We've done it! We've done it, King Leonidas.
It's going our way. Of course, we must expect them to argue for a while.
Yes, argue while our house burns.
When people are free to speak their minds, they generally are more easily handled.
That fool nearly caught me with that prediction.
I wouldn't care to go through an ordeal like that again.
Of course, it was throwing in the navy won the day for us.
Why did you do it?
The Spartans are no sailors.
Thereby your admiral won't know how to interfere with my running the fleet.
You don't mind, do you?
No. Sparta will do her duty.
She'd better do it fast.
The Persians are moving like a plague of locusts.
If we attack them here, on the plain of Thessaly, or their ships on the open sea, they'll run over us without even noticing.
We must find a position which cannot be turned.
- What about here?
- The pass of Thermopylae?
It's the best line of defence north of Corinth.
These mountains run across Greece.
The Persians must pass through here.
With a small force, I can hold that narrow strip of land until the others are ready.
And I can bring the fleet through the straits above Thermopylae, protecting your flank.
With your admiral's consent, of course.
This is a splendid plan.
When can you march?
I must speak to the council first.
But once we start, we march faster than any soldiers on earth.
In the meantime, you can send a small force of Athenians to occupy the pass.
No. Don't let's deceive ourselves.
No Greek will stir until he sees the Spartans march.
Actually march, you know.
Thrump, thrump, thrump.
Red cloaks, flutes and all.
I know. Only this will unite Greece.
I'll leave at once.
I'll deploy the ships and meet you in this bay of Locris. You and your men.
We'll be there.
Agathon! I thought I should never see you again. What happened?
- I was a guest of the Persians.
- And escaped?
- He gave me a horse.
- Why?
So I could tell the Greeks what I have seen.
- Why were you not in council?
- Because I'm not a good liar.
I don't want to frighten them.
- Then the army is as enormous as they say?
- Leonidas...
It is bigger than anything you can imagine.
For six days I watched them pass. Six days!
I ran out of numbers and still more of them came. They're drinking the rivers dry.
And at night, there are more of their campfires than there are stars in the sky.
Good.
When I was a boy, I always wanted to reach the stars with my spear.
- I don't trust that woman.
- Neither do I.
But what can we do? During the day he seeks our advice. Then comes the night and...
Shh!
My lord.
My lord!
- Hydarnes, why must you disturb me?
- I have urgent news, my lord.
Scouts report the Greeks have abandoned Thessaly.
- I knew they would. Have some wine.
- Beyond Thessaly lies the Oeta range.
With just one pass near the sea called Thermopylae.
I'm in no mood for geography.
My lord, we must send a cavalry column to secure the pass before our army reaches it.
You must do only what I order you to do.
But, my lord, as a soldier it is my duty to...
Your duty is to obey me! I don't want the Greeks to think I'm afraid of them.
If they want to fight, let them come out into the open.
I'll leave Thermopylae as an open door for them.
- And supposing...
- Enough!
It's my war and I'll conduct it my way.
Now go!
- We should be in Sparta by late afternoon.
- Yes.
Tell me, did you see Demaratus in the Persian camp?
No, but I saw a real Persia-lover there.
- Who?
- Gryllus, the father of young Phylon.
I slashed his face with a whip.
I can't believe it. He was always a good man.
He has no business to be among barbarians.
I'm only sorry now I didn't spear him.
And Phylon should be questioned. He might have known about his father's actions.
We shall speak to him.
Phylon!
- What have you been doing?
- Exercising, with spear, sword and javelin.
Talking about the war.
Everyone says we're going to march north.
- To Corinth?
- Some say as far as Thessaly.
This is a really good war. They say Xerxes has brought 100 nations with him.
Isn't that wonderful?
- When does your aunt expect Leonidas?
- Maybe tonight.
The men gave me a very good idea.
I can ask Leonidas' permission to marry you.
I'm sure the law is that the king can act for my father in time of war.
And I can speak to my aunt.
I love you, Ellas.
I've never loved anyone else.
I think I loved you when we were children.
From the earliest moment I can remember.
Now we can marry.
- And I want you.
- I know. I want you too, Phylon.
But...
But we must wait.
Why wait? You are mine, I am yours.
What is there to keep us apart?
Only ourselves, Phylon. Just for a little while.
I want time to think.
We must be strong.
We are Spartans.
Remember what they say: Once the rain has fallen, nothing can put it back into the sky.
And since when have Spartans become afraid of rain?
Phylon, son of Gryllus, you shall soon march in defence of our land.
Are you ready to hear the laws sacred to a Spartan warrior?
- Yes, Queen Gorgo.
- Here they are.
You must treasure freedom above life.
Shun pleasure for the sake of virtue.
Endure pain and hardship in silence.
Obey orders implicitly.
Seek the enemies of Greece wherever they may be, and fight them fearlessly, until victory or death.
Now... taking the place of your dead mother,
I'm giving you... this shield.
There are but these five words to remember:
E tan e epi tas.
- What does it mean?
- "With this or on this."
Either come home victorious with this shield, or dead on it.
Please excuse me.
Oh, happy day!
Congratulations!
We, the elders of Sparta, have a sacred duty to perform.
We are the guardians of Spartan blood.
'Tis for us to see to it that that precious blood is not shed, whatever the occasion may be, far away from our native soil.
Then you suggest that we do not send our men north.
Not above Corinth, Togis.
We have no common cause with empty talkers of Athens and their sinful ways.
We must defend southern Greece, where we have our homes and our allies.
Greetings.
- Greetings, King Leotychidis.
- Greetings, King Leonidas.
Greetings, friends.
I bear important news.
Sparta has been selected to lead the united Greek cities in the war against Persia both on land and on the sea.
Athens has surrendered her naval leadership to us.
- But the council decides how Sparta acts.
- Of course. But the council must act quickly.
Why?
In order that we reach the first line of defence in time.
- Where might that be?
- The pass of Thermopylae.
Of course - the pass that protects Athens.
No! It's the pass that protects Greece.
Mere cities don't matter now.
It is Greece that counts!
Only by being united can we hope to avoid slavery.
I am no politician.
But I will plead this cause until the moon wanes and the night brings forth a new day.
Yes, Ellas.
Of course I'll speak to him about you and Phylon.
You two should be married.
What could be keeping him so long?
He went straight to the council without even stopping to see me.
- He's never done that before.
- But, Aunt Gorgo, this is a dangerous time.
Everyone is talking about the war and our men marching north.
- Do you think that...
- (door opens)
- I didn't even greet you. Forgive me.
- And you haven't asked about your son.
- How is he? Is he well?
- Is he well?
Today he fought with his toy sword against a boy a whole head taller than he, and he defeated him.
You could hear his war cry all the way to the marketplace.
Strong lungs are no proof of wisdom.
You should have heard
Xenathon speak tonight.
Shouting the isolation of Sparta.
He made me sick.
- But he loves our country.
- Not as much as he hates Athens.
He can never forget his two sons were killed by the Athenians in battle.
Dead children are not easy to forget,
Leonidas.
To remember is one thing.
To grow bitter in hatred, that's another.
That man is dangerous. He could sway that council to put me in a terrible position.
I could not disobey, and I cannot break my word.
What word?
I promised Themistocles to lead my men in defence of Thermopylae.
Thermopylae?
But that's so far away from Sparta.
To a Greek, no part of Greece is far away.
You are tired, my love.
Before the sun rises you must rest.
It's past midnight.
See how dark the sky is.
When you left for Corinth,
I went to see Megistias, the old priest.
He sacrificed a lamb and read the entrails.
He said that there was wonderful good fortune for both of us.
He said that you will be the Spartan king best remembered amongst men.
And he said that for centuries to come, women will sing songs about my love for you.
- This man brings an urgent message.
- What news?
Themistocles begs us to march at once.
He says the whole of Greece is waiting.
Ride back and tell him we march today.
Summons from the council. The prediction of the oracle has arrived from Delphi.
- Alert my bodyguard.
- Yes.
"Dwellers in glorious Sparta, hear now the words of your fate."
"Either your famous city goes down in front of the Persians, or, if your city is spared, the land of Sparta must mourn for the death of one of her kings."
(Xenathon) You may leave.
- The priestess has spoken.
- Yes.
And the meaning is clear.
It is either Sparta or a Spartan king.
- I accept the challenge.
- And, in your opinion, what must be done?
The army must march at once.
There is no time to lose.
The council must grant dispensation to leave during the festival.
It is not the Spartan way to neglect the holy festivals.
Nor to neglect Greece.
The alert order has gone to my bodyguard, who are not subject to decisions of the council.
All the other troops are waiting in their quarters. Do not let them wait long, friends.
Ellas.
Let me look. Let me look at you.
How handsome you are.
The red war-cloaks are so becoming to men.
This way no enemy will ever see Spartan blood.
Ellas, we may march tomorrow.
I must go to the king now.
Yes, let us go. I've spoken to my aunt already.
My father's gone to the king's house and is waiting.
Seems that all my life I've waited forjust this day. At last you're going to be my wife.
- The wife of a real Spartan soldier.
- Just wait till I come back.
I'll bring ten Persian slave girls to wait on you hand and foot.
Bring just one and you'll be a dead Spartan.
Now, as soon as the council proclaims a state of war, the whole army will come under my orders.
While King Leotychidis, in accordance with the law, will remain at home.
Pentheus, son of Salas, will be my second in command.
I thank you for honouring me.
- May I put forward a personal request?
- Of course, Pentheus.
My daughter Ellas is waiting outside with Phylon.
He asks permission to speak to you about a matter concerning both our families.
Let them come in.
Speak, Phylon.
Sir, I've come to ask your permission to marry Ellas, daughter of Pentheus.
Her father's granted his consent but, since my father's away on family business in Thrace,
I beg you to act in his stead.
- When did you last hear from your father?
- Not since he left Sparta.
He was supposed to return way before now.
Have you any idea what might have caused this delay?
No, sir.
Is there anything wrong?
Agathon believes so.
While I was being tortured by the Persians,
I saw your father in the enemy camp.
- No. Not my father.
- He was there with ex-king Demaratus.
- That's not possible.
- I'm not used to telling lies!
- You may have been mistaken...
- I tell you, I spoke to him!
He still bears the mark of my whip on his face.
Sir, I beg you by the immortal gods, let me wipe out this disgrace.
Put me in the first line of battle.
Let me die a Spartan!
As a freeborn man, you are not responsible for your father's actions.
Yet I cannot ask my soldiers to accept into their ranks a man whose father is consorting with the enemy.
- But, sir...
- That is my final word!
You will surrender your war-cloak to the officer on duty.
You may go.
I cannot find him anywhere.
I'm frightened. I don't know what to do.
Take hold of yourself.
Sparta gives her women more freedom than any state. In return it demands strength.
How can I be strong? I love him.
You must be strong.
Remember the mother who killed her son when he returned with a wound in his back.
Why should I remember? Phylon would never turn his back to the enemy.
- If only they would let him fight.
- I am not a general.
I cannot order the men to take him with them.
How can you talk like this? You know Phylon.
His mother was your best friend.
That does not matter.
- Have you heard?
- What?
The council has made its decision. Here it is.
"People of Sparta. The army will presently march in defence of our land against Persia."
"The men are hereby ordered to be ready to depart after the festival of Carnea."
- So you cannot go today.
- I can and will!
And disobey the council?
- My bodyguard is not subject to the council.
- But that's only 300 men.
I promised to have my men at Thermopylae.
I didn't say how many.
- This is madness.
- Less than to keep a festival and lose the war!
- Leave us please, Ellas.
- Ellas. You know how sorry I am.
I know.
Leonidas.
Why not wait until the festival is over?
And then lead out the whole army as a Spartan king should lead it.
- It's only a few days.
- No. Even a day might be too late.
All Greece waits for the Spartans to march.
A mere 300 men.
Since when have Spartans started counting numbers going into battle?
We are but a vanguard. The rest will join us just as soon as the festival is over.
But what if the Persians attack you before then?
Then we shall fight alone.
Leonidas.
My love.
I know your courage.
I am proud of you.
But there are times when prudence...
(sighs)
I don't know what I am saying.
I only know I cannot live without you.
You must trust me.
I love you more than life itself.
I don't want you to die.
It would be my end, too.
Leonidas, the men are ready.
Agathon, the law allows me to take 300 men.
Dismiss all those with no living sons and replace them with volunteers who have.
I don't want any Spartan family to die out.
- Phylon!
- Ellas!
- Why are you here?
- Because I love you.
There is nothing to love now.
I've been rejected by my own people.
I have no honour, no country.
- No name, no home. I'm an outcast.
- I, too, am an outcast.
I've left my father's house and I shall not return unless you come with me.
Sparta does not want me.
I'm ashamed of you. What if the king has refused to take you with him?
You are a free man and a soldier.
Prove it to him and he will take you back.
- How can I prove it?
- Surely not by killing yourself.
Look.
- My shield.
- Yes. Your shield.
You left it behind. Did you forget the words my aunt spoke giving it to you?
"Victory or death."
Take this shield.
Follow our soldiers.
Show them that you are a man and a Spartan.
And I shall be there watching you.
Look there.
300 men. To stand against the whole of Asia.
No.
And all Spartans.
Halt!
This is the bay of Locris, where we're to meet with Themistocles.
In the meantime, we'll rest here until sundown.
Then we'll march all night.
We must be in Thermopylae by sunrise.
Look.
There he is now.
Take Themistocles to that fisherman's hut.
- Do you want to bathe, Ellas?
- No. Just to rest.
- Are you ill, Ellas?
- No, of course not.
Just tired and so cold.
Yes, you are shivering.
You haven't eaten in two days.
I shouldn't have brought you with me.
We'll rest now. Yes, we'll rest now.
(fish splashes)
We have 271 ships lying in the straits.
The Persians are in the bay beyond.
1200 warships, with a good number of auxiliary craft.
- Then we are outnumbered six to one.
- Yes.
But geography is on our side. In the narrow waters we can give them a good fight.
- How many men have you brought?
- 300 Spartans.
- My personal bodyguard.
Other Spartans will follow after the festival.
- Another festival?
- We are religious people.
I know.
Some day I may enter religion myself.
It's better than politics.
With the gods behind you, you can be far more irresponsible.
Themistocles, we invoked divine help coming here. This is no time for impious remarks.
Forgive me... friend.
Greetings, friends. Leonidas.
Demophilus.
We've heard all of Sparta's on the march.
I've been riding since sunrise trying to catch up. Your men move like lightning.
- They have an appointment at Thermopylae.
- Yes, we heard about that too.
Can my warriors of Thespiae join you?
- There's always room. How many of you?
- About 700. All volunteers.
I couldn't hold them back when they heard about Sparta leading us in this war.
- Where do we find you?
- Thermopylae at daybreak.
The rest of our armies join us there.
Wonderful. But don't start the killing before we arrive.
You Spartans go wild when you smell the enemy. Leave some for us.
- We are Greeks, too.
- At Thermopylae.
"We are Greeks, too."
Did you hear what that man said?
Can this be the beginning of the miracle we've been waiting for?
Let us pray so.
You know, Leonidas, people call me a master politician.
Also a cynic, mountebank and a charlatan.
They're all wrong.
I'm nothing but a sentimental old fool desperately in love with a dream:
One free, united Greece.
That is no dream.
I think we should have told Demophilus that we are only 300 Spartans.
And ruin all my work?
I've sent 20 runners around with the news that the entire Spartan army is marching north.
- But that's not true.
- Truth is a heady wine, friend.
A politician must never exaggerate people's capacity for it.
- I thank the gods I am only a soldier.
- And I thank them I'm a politician.
Between us we may make our dream come true.
I must get back to my boats.
Get the men ready.
Halt!
(shouts order)
Spartans! We have reached Thermopylae.
The orders are, from this wall we do not retreat.
Somebody?
Somebody!
Greetings, friends.
Ephialtes, bring some water.
Oh, she's ill. Poor child.
Ephialtes! Where is that fool? Ephialtes!
- Your wife?
- Thermopylae. How far is it?
Not far. Just over those cliffs there.
- You see, if you go by...
- Be quiet. Quiet!
Take her inside.
Carry her.
Gently. Don't hurt her.
Goats have more brains than men!
Who can understand the way of gods?
They create lovely girls, and then turn them into wives.
- You're the first strangers to visit us in years.
- It was kind of you to give us shelter.
We have been herding goats here in the mountains all our lives, my wife and I.
She'll be better by sunrise.
But her feet, all swollen and sore.
- Our home is far away.
- Athens?
By the gods, no!
Have you not heard of Sparta?
Yes. They speak little, fight much. Eat that black broth that turns up the stomach.
- And their girls go about naked.
- Naked?
- That's what I heard.
- When?
- When I was young.
- Ephialtes.
More milk.
No.
I'm going to look after the goats.
I heard a wolf last night in the mountains.
- Your son?
- You think we'd have a son like that?
We don't know where he came from.
He just arrived one day.
Said he had quarrelled with the people in the valley.
Maybe a runaway slave. Maybe a thief.
But in the mountains, everyone is equal.
Have you heard anything about the Persians?
We see them when it's clear.
Come with me.
Look between those two hills.
- Have they been there long?
- For several days. And they are still coming.
More campfires every day.
Lucky Thermopylae is the only way through.
You mean it's lucky that the Persians don't know the other way.
- Is there another way?
- Yes. There is an old goat track.
It winds through the mountains and it comes down beyond the pass.
Nobody uses it now, but it's still there.
We must let the Spartans know. If the
Persians found it, our men would be trapped.
King Xerxes would give much gold to know about it, wouldn't he?
Come inside. It's getting cold.
We'll talk there.
I don't want you to get sick, too.
This is called the middle gate of Thermopylae.
It is too narrow for fighting in open order.
We will use our special tactics for close-in fighting.
And the rest can learn from watching the Spartans.
Shall we keep the men in their own units?
Yes. Men prefer to die among their friends.
- Who are you?
- I am a goatherd.
I know these mountains well.
I have come to tell you there is a path leading through them from the north.
It's a bad path, but the Persians could use it.
We know there is a path.
Our scouts are looking, but can't find it.
I can show the way.
It runs by the Callidromus mountain.
We'd better hurry, sir. The accursed barbarians are probably looking for it, too.
Agathon, dispatch all the Phocian troops.
Have them block that path and guard it.
Thank you, my friend.
If I had gold I would give it to you.
All we have is armour.
Take the best sword you can find.
I don't do this for gold.
And I'm too old to use a sword.
If I were younger, I would bring my own sword and be standing with you in battle.
Let's go, friend. It's a long walk.
Xerxes has men in millions. We have Greeks.
(fanfare)
I cannot believe there's only one pass through the mountains, Demaratus.
I've not heard of another one, my lord.
- Where is the main Greek army?
- Our scouts swam past Thermopylae.
The Greeks are camped far beyond it.
Still a small force.
I presume they are waiting for more men.
The more the better. If they insist on fighting, we can wipe them all out in one battle.
- What about the pass itself?
- Still held by just a few Spartans.
Some are rebuilding the wall. Others are just sitting on the rocks and sharpening weapons.
- The fools.
- Not a good sign, my lord.
It means that the Spartans will fight.
Whether reinforcements arrive or not.
They are mad.
I cannot think why you want to be king of such an extraordinary people, Demaratus.
I shall capture them and put them in cages.
Exhibit them all over Persia.
(man) My king!
Cyrus.
My brother.
How did this happen?
Speak!
We were on patrol, my lord. Near the pass.
Suddenly the Spartans came at us like devils. Swarms of them.
We fought. But it was a narrow place and we could not get near them.
Hydarnes.
See that my brother's body is buried with full honours.
And as for these cowards... let them be buried, too.
- My lord.
- Alive!
My lord, as a soldier, death is my duty.
And if I offend you, I'll be glad to die for it.
- But I feel that I must warn you.
- Well?
You have been listening to bad advice, my lord. If we had occupied the pass...
I know that I've listened to some people too much. But that period is over.
- Mardonius.
- My lord.
Tomorrow at dawn, we take the pass and march on.
I want no prisoners or slaves in this war.
- Every Greek is to be put to the sword!
- Very good, my lord.
Give your men this one night.
Then destroy all the soldiers' women.
There are enough women in Sparta and Athens.
And I want my men to be eager to get at them.
Very good, my lord.
Well done, Myron.
Not many of that Persian patrol got away.
It was easy, sir.
Five of us and only ten of them.
There is movement in the enemy camp.
It looks as though they intend to attack.
We need one more day to finish rebuilding that wall.
We must gain that day.
- Isn't that the king's tent near the shore?
- Yes.
Pick out 30 men for me. All good swimmers.
- I could swim the Evrotas river as a boy.
- No, you must stay, to take over command.
But if you're killed?
Then Greece will fight all the more fiercely.
But without Xerxes all that great horde would fall to pieces.
Have the men assemble by that rock at sundown.
I'm going to stay here tonight.
Go back, friend. And thank you.
The orders are silence and speed.
If I am killed, Pentheus will take command.
(music)
Silence.
- Where's the king?
- Gone away to visit the queen.
(screaming)
(man) My queen!
Come.
General alarm.
There is a great fire on the shore.
The king's camp is burning.
See that my boat is made ready!
- How is it?
- It missed the main artery, I think.
We shall see now.
This day will pass in peace.
I see it on the barb.
Blood curdles well.
As always, Megistias, your omens speak truthfully.
The Persian camp is disrupted.
It'll take them all day to put it together.
- Where's that young fool?
- There.
He... he saved my life, Leonidas.
I know that. He also disobeyed his orders.
In wartime the punishment is death.
You know that.
- Yes.
- So death it will be.
Get him his armour and a red cloak.
That's the only way for Spartans to die these days.
Half the camp burned!
Myself almost captured! And all by a handful of Greeks. Where were your men?
These Spartans are scarcely human, my lord.
They see in the night like cats.
This is no answer!
I'm surrounded by incompetent fools.
Fear, panic, disorder!
How can this happen to the army that was made to conquer the world?
Panic started amongst the conscript savages.
By the end of the day we shall restore order.
But this day is already lost.
And the Spartans are still in the pass.
By noon tomorrow,
I want to see every one of them destroyed!
Or all of you will forfeit your lives!
Leave me!
(man) They're killing our women!
Phylon.
Ellas.
- You're a Spartan again.
- Leonidas took me back into the army.
- You must have done something wonderful.
- Nothing another Spartan wouldn't do.
- How are you now?
- My fever's all gone.
Old Toris made me a bowl of herbs.
She's so kind.
I can look at you again.
I'm no longer ashamed of myself.
I've never been ashamed of you.
I knew you were always a good soldier.
- But...
- Yes?
I've been watching Samos and Toris.
They're such good and simple people.
They know nothing about honour and glory.
But Toris knows that every night her man will be sleeping at her side.
They live for themselves. They do no harm.
Is it a crime to want to live in peace?
No, Ellas. But you shouldn't speak like that.
- Why, you yourself gave me the shield.
- I know. I know it all.
I know that for a Spartan, life is a kind of preparation for death.
But why should a love like ours go down and be trampled in dirt and blood?
We must be ready to die for our country.
But we don't have to die.
- I want to live and come to you with victory.
- Victory? Did you see the enemy out there?
And there are only 300 of you.
We have men from other cities. Good men.
Everybody expects the Spartans to die first.
- Why hasn't the Spartan army arrived?
- They will come.
- When?
- I don't know, but they will come.
Our people won't abandon us.
(horses galloping)
- Those are the horses of Leonidas.
- That's my aunt's servant riding them.
It must be an important message from Sparta.
I must get back to camp.
Ellas, I must go.
My wife is a very clever woman.
Even if the messenger had been captured, no one would have guessed that there was a message hidden under the wax.
Shall we leave you alone, Leonidas?
No.
This news concerns us all.
Our troops are not coming.
Why, Leonidas?
The council made a secret decision to fortify the isthmus of Corinth, and not to go beyond it.
- Then we cannot stay here!
- We can. And we must.
We've received no orders to leave.
And we have our duty to Greece.
Greeks followed us because they believed in our word. We are not going to break it.
Here we stay! And here we stand!
- For how long?
- Until we win!
Or die.
Greetings, friends. What are the omens?
Last night a lioness came down to the pass with three of her cubs.
She cried piteously, as if begging mercy for her children.
This is a bad omen for Persia.
I accept the omen.
The Spartans will meet the first attack.
The rest of the troops will stand by in reserve until I send for them.
- My men want to fight, Leonidas.
- All Greeks want to fight.
But the Spartans were here first. We will lead.
The others will watch us, ready to move in when ordered.
To your places, friends.
- How many altogether?
- 20,000, my lord.
The rest are ready to march through the pass once it's cleared.
- We shall be in Athens in four days.
- Good.
I've ordered Mardonius to draw up the Sagartian horsemen behind the infantry.
Just before contact with the enemy, they will surprise the Spartans and take them alive.
Excellent, my lord.
I shall have Leonidas nailed to a board and watch him die as we eat our meal at noon.
Come, let us enjoy this in peace.
Enemy is on the move. Drawing nearer to us.
Good. It also means that we are drawing nearer to them.
(man) Spears!
They intend to surprise us by faking an infantry charge.
Pass the word to Agathon and Pentheus.
Be ready for horsemen.
- Cavalry.
- Cavalry.
- Cavalry.
- Cavalry.
Spartans... attack!
Spartans attack!
Drive them into the sea!
Don't let them escape!
- What does this mean?
- Leonidas has guessed our manoeuvre.
He's killed most horsemen, forcing the rest to confound our foot soldiers. Then he attacked!
He is slaughtering my men like sheep!
The cowards!
No. These men are a match for any regular soldiers. The Spartans fight like machines.
Leonidas. Leonidas.
- What news?
- A Persian herald.
Hydarnes wants to speak with you.
- Hydarnes?
- Yes. Shall I bring him here?
So he can see our defences? No. Here.
Get me a clean cloak.
How many men for your escort?
A Spartan king needs no escort to talk to a mere Persian.
- Greetings, Leonidas.
- Greetings, Hydarnes.
The great king admires the valour of you and your men.
Thank him. And tell him we will earn even more of his admiration today.
Stubbornness will avail you nothing. It's only a matter of time before you lose this battle.
Perhaps.
But by that time you will have lost your war.
Yesterday we only probed your defences.
When we attack today, our arrows will blot out the sun.
Then we will fight in the shade.
But this slaughter is useless.
Surrender your arms... and my king will spare you and your Spartans.
What shall I tell him?
Molon lave.
Come and take them.
(man) Spears!
(whistles)
Archers!
Spears! Spears!
Guards!
Advance!
The greatest army in the world, routed by savages!
We are giving Leonidas cheap victories, my lord.
Chariots cannot manoeuvre in that pass!
- I must see this pass cleared this morning.
- Then do it quickly. Send in the lmmortals.
- My own bodyguard?
- They are the only men that can match them.
Once we wipe out the Spartans fanatics, the rest of the Greeks will give way.
Very well, Hydarnes.
But I hold you responsible.
Pentheus.
What would you do now, if you were Xerxes?
Send in fresh troops. My very best.
That is just what he's doing.
These are his lmmortals.
The whole Persian army is watching them.
If we beat them back, fear will grip the others.
Phylon!
We'll fall back deliberately.
Pretend to be dead and stay here.
Put the torches under the chariot.
To your places, friends.
(groans)
Yes.
What are we to do now?
It was your idea.
You told me to send in the lmmortals.
You! You!
How can you expect these others to fight after what they've seen today?
My lord... you have the power to have me slain.
Silence!
Death is too good for you.
Get out of my sight!
I don't want to see your insolent face again! Go!
Another day.
The Spartans fought well.
So did the Thespians and all the other Greeks.
We can hold Thermopylae.
I've...
I have waited for the time when I could see you alone.
Why?
I'm...
I'm going down into the valley.
This is no place for you.
Come with me. Come with me.
I'll give you rubies and gold.
Touch me again and I'll strike you.
You? You strike me?
My lord.
Artemisia.
Surely you at least must be the bearer of good tidings.
Would that I were.
- Artemisia. You are hurt?
- No. I'm all right.
But your fleet had no more success today than your army.
And three of my ships were sunk.
Even the gods seem to conspire against me.
My ships falter, my troops in revolt...
Seized by fear that spreads like leprosy through the camp.
- What am I to do?
- Halt these senseless attacks which the Greeks are turning into victories, demoralising your men.
Another day of this and your own troops will destroy you.
You must stop this war.
With two of my brothers slain?
And Leonidas still in the pass?
I've sworn to destroy him.
This is Hydarnes' fault!
When the lmmortals failed, all others lost heart.
Heart.
Yes.
I'll have his heart for this.
I'll have it cut out and brought to me on a platter!
No! Then you would admit defeat.
There's a better way.
- What is it?
- Even the greatest king cannot defy the gods.
Tell your men you've had a message from heaven to return to Persia.
By this you would save your honour, reaffirm your divine origins, and rob Leonidas of victory.
Yes.
Yes.
It was a dark day when the first woman came into this world.
Mardonius.
My lord.
I have had a vision in which my father's shade appeared to me.
He told me to destroy the rebellious foreign troops, go back to Persia, and collect a new army.
I dare not disobey him.
We march at sunrise.
Go and see that all is made ready.
Very good, my lord.
Now I know why they call you "great king".
They tell me your mother was a Greek, and that you're a secret enemy trying to destroy me with your advice.
If I could prove it, I'd have your throat cut.
The bone is not broken and none of the muscles are cut.
Let me seal the wound with the iron.
Help him, Megistias. We need such men.
(music)
My lord.
- My lord.
- Yes.
I beg you to accept this gift I bring to you.
- Gift? What gift?
- Victory!
- What sort of ajoke is this?
- Ajoke, my lord?
This man will lead you to the victory which you have forsworn so easily.
Listen to him.
Who are you?
My name is Ephialtes.
I live in these mountains.
What are you doing here?
I know a secret path through these mountains.
- What secret path?
- An old goat track.
It comes down on the other side of Thermopylae.
- Can you lead us there?
- You see, I'm a poor man.
Not any more. This is worth gold to you.
As much gold as you can carry.
Take him away.
Hydarnes, cancel all orders.
Take half the lmmortals and go with this man.
I will lead the troops from this side.
We will attack at sunrise and trap Leonidas. Go!
You can have Greece as I promised. Empty and beautiful. Doesn't that make you happy?
What if this is a trap? Those mountains are treacherous. You could lose your whole army.
You must have a dependable guide.
- Yes, but I have no one.
- Yes, you have. Gryllus. He's with Demaratus.
Why not let him go with your troops?
Halt!
Take me to the king.
I am Ellas, daughter of Pentheus.
And the queen's niece.
Follow me.
Father!
Ellas!
What are you doing here?
Persians are coming through the mountains.
Phylon's father came to where I was staying.
- I led him here.
- We have been betrayed.
Hydarnes and his lmmortals are coming behind you.
They broke through your Phocian guards.
I escaped during the night to warn you.
- You traitor.
- No! If he was a traitor, why is he here?
Call the Spartans to arms.
Artemisia sent me, Leonidas.
Phylon.
You ride back to the pass.
Tell all Greek troops to retreat before they're cut off.
Then I can return.
I didn't come to be a messenger.
You're here to obey orders!
Phylon, the message you carry today will buy centuries of freedom for Greece.
Tell the Spartans we are staying here obedient to their word.
- Ellas, you must hurry.
- Ellas.
Ellas.
Tell my wife to take care of our son.
Tell her that I am thinking of them both.
I will, Leonidas.
Come, child.
Why are you here? Take your men out.
- My Thespians are staying.
- And disobeying me?
We obey our honour.
Where do we fight?
You're a bad soldier, but a good Greek.
Go to the end of the pass and hold it as long as you can.
Here.
Only Spartans with living sons have the privilege to fight today.
And you've got one of the best.
Come, old friend.
Today we carve out our own omens.
Sir, the main body of the Greek army has escaped in the direction of Opus.
- Who are left in the pass?
- The Thespians are at one end.
The Spartans at the other, facing the army of the king.
Fools.
I wish I had men like that fighting for me.
Immortals, march!
Thespians, advance! Attack!
- Have you heard?
- Agathon has just told me.
We have been betrayed.
Take your ships out of the straits at once.
This is our last morning at Thermopylae.
I must move the fleet.
But the ships can still take you out of this.
No. We shall stay here.
What about your wounded?
Spartan wounded go home only with victory.
In defeat they die with the rest.
I would share this day with you, Leonidas.
But I must be with the fleet when it fights again at Salamis.
I know you don't put much trust in omens, Themistocles.
But last night,
Megistias received a most wondrous vision.
Megistias, tell him your vision.
I saw ships burning between two shores.
Many of them.
With Persian markings on their sails.
There was Xerxes sitting upon a throne, his face in gloom, listening to the cries of burning men.
And behind him, the goddess Athena, all in white, a golden spear in her hand.
She was smiling.
Tell him all.
And a voice was saying:
"Divine Salamis, you will bring death to the enemies of Greece when the seeds are sown or the harvests are gathered in."
Thank you, old man.
They're advancing, sir.
King Xerxes is leading them in his chariot.
I'll be right there.
We shall be watching you fight at Salamis,
Megistias and I.
We shall not fail you... friend.
Sir, Hydarnes is attacking the Thespians in our rear.
We are cut off.
- And the others?
- All retreated safely.
Tell Demophilus to hold out as long as he can.
Spartans!
The orders for the day.
We can no longer defend the pass.
So we shall attack and kill Xerxes!
(man) Close the ranks!
Spartans... advance!
Right flank, advance!
Get the body of Leonidas!
Halt!
Halt!
Circle! Circle! Circle!
Circle!
My lord.
Your lmmortals have destroyed the Greek rearguard to the last man.
You hear Hydarnes' message.
Go deliver my final offer to the Spartans.
The lmmortals have wiped out your rearguard.
But the great king grants you your lives.
Give us the body of Leonidas and you can depart.
- We stay with our king.
- Your position is hopeless.
In a few moments you will be dead.
But Greece will live.
- Speak!
- My king, they will not surrender.
- Shall we attack, my lord?
- I shall waste no more of our men.
Finish them with arrows.
Archers!
Archers!
(narrator) "O stranger, tell the Spartans
that we lie here obedient to their word."
This last message of the fallen heroes
rallied Greece to victory.
First at Salamis, as predicted,
and then at Plataea.
But it was more than a victory for Greece.
It was a stirring example
to free people throughout the world
of what a few brave men can accomplish
once they refuse to submit to tyranny.
ENGLISH SDH
December, 1944.
British and American Armies were on the threshold of victory.
Stretched across half of europe.
The allies cathered themselves for the final assault of Germany.
To the north stood montcomery's
Eichth army.
To the south, patton's third.
In the center.
Along an 88-mile front.
A few battle-weary Amercan divisions
Rested in a quiet sector.
To them.
The war seemed already won.
This is their story.
Colonel, we've been flying
Over these woods all week.
There's nothing but trees.
Let's turn back.
Getting hungry, Joe?
The war is over.
I hear CHQ is shipping
Us home for Christmas.
Joe, the German Army still has
Six million men carrying arms.
They're not going home for Christmas.
Hey, there it is.
The German Amry.
Let's go down and have a look.
Buzz him acain. Joe.
I'll get a picturre.
Ok.
This time gun your engine.
Make him look up.
It worked.
Swing around, Joe.
I want to get another one.
Conrad?
I am ashamed of you.
Get up.
They could have killed us, sir.
If you had taken the pains to look carefully.
You would have observed.
It was an unarmed reconnaissance plane.
You would stay in the car
If fighter planes were shooting at us.
I did not lose a man to die in the back
Seat of a car.
Does the Colonel think anyone has a
Choice where to die?
I know where you'll die, conrad...
At home, in your own bed.
Is the Colonel trying to cet rid of me?
I think...
The world is coing to get
Rid of both of us.
Pick up your cap!
Put it on!
Try to look like a soldier!
What good is a soldier anyhow?
He wins, he loses.
What's he good for anyhow?
Conrad, I've told you before.
Never leave the motor running.
Petrol is blood.
I am sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.
Looks like something
On the cround at 10:00.
Let's take a look.
Nothing
Let's go home
Herr oberst Hessler is here.
Nach links, herr oberst.
Colonel Hessler, sir.
Ja.
Well, Hessler...
It has been a long time.
How good it is to see you acain.
You look the same.
A little... a little leaner, perhaps, hmm?
The Russian front does not put meat on a man's bones.
Cenral.
Ah, yes.
War is hard on all of us.
Central heating.
Crystal Chandeliers.
You have a nice cellar.
Field Hitler goering gave me that painting.
Lovely, isn't it?
I imagine he found a barcain in Paris last year.
My corporal is waiting outside. He's had a hard drive.
Is there somewhere in these runs. He can find a bed?
Sit down, Hessler.
You have too little faith.
In the genius of the german people.
A few stones have been knocked down.
But our country is strong...
United... Determined...
And more productive than ever.
The allies think that their constant air raids.
Have undermined our morale.
This they shall never do.
Why send for me, General?
You are our finest panzer commander
Hessler.
You will lead us to victory.
Our Germany is now like an iceberg...
Only a fraction of it can be seen on the surface.
Let me show you some of the results of
What Germany has produced underground.
You will discover a new Germany
And will take a new pride in being a German.
Our latest airplane.
A jet.
It files at more than
900 kilometers per hour.
Within six months.
We will have enough jet fighters
To shoot down every allied plane in the air.
Our V-1 rocket.
Destroyed 20% of london.
The V-2 will utterly smash the city.
The new 70-ton king tiger tank.
It has 21/2 times the fire power
And double the armor of the American tanks.
Our Germany is far from finished, hmm, Hessler?
It's a very... beautiful model, General.
It proves that the Germans
Are still the world's best toymakers.
Ha. The toys we are making these days.
Are not for children.
Let me show them to you.
We will attack...
Throuch the losheim cap.
Which is deffended only by a sincle battalion.
The American division on the schnee
Eifel will be cut off.
The our river bridge will be in our hands.
From there on the Ambleve, with the road network.
In four days, we will be across the river Meuse.
The strategic objective?
Antwerp.
By taking Antwerp.
We split the enemy forces in two.
It will take them 18 months to recover.
By then, we will have air superiority
With our jet encines,
And we will have even more significant
Aeapons- Weapons which can destroy
An entire city with a single blast.
You have forgotten one important detail, General.
With their present control of the air.
The allies will smash our tanks, machine Gun our troops
Bomb the bridges.
And cut our communications.
Suppose I tell you there will be no
Allied planes.
Another secret weapon?
From Spitsbergen, norway...
The northernmost weather station in the world.
We have been waiting two months for this report.
"A low pressure area over northern europe "Starting december
"Low clouds and FOG, which will ground all aircraft."
How long?
Long enough.
If we keep strictly to our timetable.
Unusual clock, isn't it?
It has only 1 cycle...
50 hours.
We have the resources for
50 hours full-scale attack.
Maps... Clocks... Toys
But with what will I fight?
Colonel Hessler,
I am putting you
In comand our armored spearhead.
I got a Christmas cake from home today.
Think I'll be around to eat it?
Bring me the prints as soon
As they're developed.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Kiley.
Find any Germans under your bed this morning?
Marching there all night.
Couldn't sleep a wink.
That's an order.
I want every item on that menu
Delivered to every soldier in the Division,
Especialy those in the forward positions.
Deliver them in time for
Christmas dinner.
Counterintellicence picked this up
From an enemy acent, dated November 29.
"From field marshal Kitel, most secret.
"Officers and men who speak English
"And wanted for special mission.
"Volunteers will report to
General Kohler's headquarters."
What do you make of it?
In my opinion, General,
This is one more confirmation
They're going to attack us.
Come on, Kiley. Not that acain.
They're probably preparing a fifth column
To drop behind our lines.
Were you in the state department, too. Kiley?
I thought your experience was limited to police work.
Haveing have an inspector of police
Doesn't disqualify me from thinking.
All cops aren't flatfoots.
Your limited military experience
Doesn't exactly inspire confidence in your conclusions.
If you think... Why do you say they're mounting an offensive?
I spent 20 years before the war asking questions.
Ever since D-day, you've had me doing the same thing...
Interrocating prisoners.
I can only report what I've learned.
The Grman soldier facing us is still undefeated.
He can still fight.
His leaders know that.
As long as he can fight, they'll attack.
I have io other officers in my section.
We see the same information,
Get the same facts as you.
All of us arrive at one answer,
And yours is a complete opposite.
When 10 men tell you you're drunk,
You'd better lie down.
You may be my superior officer...
He is.
Excuse me, sir.
Here are your prints, Colonel.
Thank you.
Look what showed up on this one.
I took it over the ardennes.
Is this a tiger tank, or isn't it?
So it appears.
Doesn't make a juncle.
Sir.
Tiger belong in jungles.
But when there's one in a peaceful neighborhood.
I recommend we all look under our beds.
Excuse me, sir.
Step outside.
With your permission, sir.
This is from headquarters,
Kiley. Top secret.
The third army has been ordered
To attack the cermans in the saar.
General Patton is launghing the offensive in two days.
Does it seem possible headquarters would commit an entire army
To an offensive in the south
If there were any possibility
Of germans attacking in the ardennes?
With all due respect toheadquarters,
They could be wrong.
Send this to headquarters anyway, pritchard.
There seem to be new features on that tank.
Yes, sir. Anything else?
I'd like a rundown on this german officer.
All right. Send this along.
Yes, sir.
Get up to the line. Tell them to grab some new prisoners.
I want any fresh information I can get.
Yes, sir.
And one thing more...
Why are you in a reconnaissance plane?
You're not a combat soldier.
Trying to shorten the war.
All by yourself?
I just want to enjoy
That nice Christmas dinner you ordered.
I see the Colonel's in fine appetite again.
I am.
Join me in a glass of wine.
Thank you, sir.
Sit down.
Thanks.
Conrad.
Speak.
What does the Colonel wish me to say?
Speak your mind... the truth.
Don't be afraid, Conrad.
I must have someone to tell me the truth.
I've always been fortunate to serve under brilliant men.
Who know everything.
From them I have learned one thing.
When all was lost,
These brilliant men never lost hope.
I admire that.
What else do you admire about these men?
The illusion.
Maybe... l'm not using the right word,
Colonel.
I'm... Not an educated man.
The hope that there's always one more chance,
That is the illusion.
Go on, Conrad. Yes, that's very good.
On, it's not my place to speak of such things.
Go on.
I order you to.
Colonel.
This new command...
Is an illusion.
Give it up.
I am martin Hessler.
For years ago, my panzers overran poland in one week.
That was no illusion.
In 39 days.
My tanks smashed all the way to Paris.
That way no illusion.
I conquered the crimea.
That was no illusion.
Today...
I was given a brigade of tiger tanks.
When I have a brigade of tanks.
That is reality.
And who will drive your tanks?
The men you led were soldiers veteran soldiers.
Are there any left?
What will they give you now?
I was by your side in Poland, france, the crimea.
Look at me. I'm no tthe same man.
I jumped in a ditch today
At the sight of an unarmed reconnaissange plane.
My two boys remember me as a good soldier.
They wouldn't believe it,
But, Colonel, I am not the only one.
How sure can you be
Of the men who will drive your tanks?
Major diepel.
Jawohl, oberst.
Diepel.
I want to see my tank commanders.
Have them assemble at once.
Jawohl, oberst.
Conrad.
My boots.
Achtung!
Your commanders, sir.
Boys. Too many boys.
The first battle will turn them into men.
In the old days, I lived six months with my men
Before going into action.
We knew each other.
These are strangers.
Too many boys.
They have never tasted defeat.
Do they know what is expected of them?
They are ready to die for you
Can you ask more?
Sing.
Louder.
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!
Pull up.
We got brass on our tail...
Pull it forward, you idiot!
Heh heh heh.
Drop dead.
Pull it forward, you idiot!
Just a little bit. Hold it.
Hold it! Hold it!
You're dropping my merchandise!
Barrel, Eddie, come on out of there!
Come on, Cortland!
Oh ho ho ho.
Oh, wow.
Disaster.
Oh.
Solid.
Some driver, huh?
Lucky thing for you nothing's busted.
Complain to my union.
Yeah, tie it up.
Are we near enemy territory yet?
Too near. Give me a cigarette.
I don't smoke.
When will we see some germans?
Hey, Barrel.
Smoke your own.
You got a cigarette, Eddie?
You kidding?
You cheapskates.
Reach into my duffel bag get me some cigarettes.
What's with you and the germans?
Nothing. I've just never seen one.
I've never even seen a german plane.
When are we going to get any action?
What are you, some kind of a nut?
What kind of replacements they sending us, huh?
"I want to see action."
What's this?
Put that back.
That's merchandise.
Don't tell me there's women where we're going.
Who are you giving these to?
Guffy don't give nothing.
He's peddling them.
Keep tying it up, huh?
Peddling them? To who?
The boys in the front.
They'll need that when they cet to Germany.
There's lots of broads there.
Wow! French perfume!
Champagne
That's going to bring me bills a bottle where we're going
Because there's nothing too good for our boys.
Yeah. What's in here?
The mail.
Are you going to charce them for that, too?
Huh?
No. They wouldn't sit still for that, huh?
Just kidding. Sarge. Just kidding.
No. When you get these good thoughts,
You tell me anyway.
One thing I'm not going back home again is poor!
Keep thinking, Kid. Very nice.
Germans?
This is the up-front front.
Wide-awake bunch of boys.
Don't you people post a sentry?
Sorry. I just came in for a second.
What's the matter with you?
Close the pneumonia hole!
Where where you born, in a barn?
Sorry, sir. We didn't know it was you.
Major Wolenski?
He's over there, sir.
Oh, hello, Colonel.
I wasn't expecting a visit from the front office.
I would've had my men smarten up.
Some hot coffee for the Colonel.
Come over and get warm.
You run a pretty loose outfit here.
That radio's been yakking between Christmas carols
We're all going home.
Here, sit down.
It's tough to try to keep discipline
When the only action around here
Is sitting on your butt, trying to keep warm.
What are the Germans doing on the ridge?
Same thing, except they don't have ny heat.
They exercise to keep from freezing.
I got a little exercise for your boys.
I want a patrol tonight to pick up some prisoners.
Well, there they are.
Hey, Sarge, put those blankets back.
Come on. Shut the window.
Why are you doing that, Sarge?
You know they're out of range.
They'll only shoot back with something heavier.
It's you or them, docface.
I need practice.
That's enough, Sergeant.
You want to play with that popgun, go outside.
What if I take the men out
For a field drill, Lieutenant?
In the weather?
What for?
Because they're drilling, that's why.
I'll let you know when I want a drill,
Sergeant.
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.
I'll take that Sergeant.
All right. That's all right.
But I'll pick the rest of your volunteers.
Here you are, Colonel.
We got about three hours before dark.
How about some half-and-half?
Just sweeten it.
Bitte.
You are Colonel Hessler?
Who are you?
How did you get in here?
General Kohler's signature is magic.
You will excuse us. Major.
Before you give orders.
May I ask your rank?
Courtesan first class,
Compliments of General Kohler.
I think we have covered everything, Colonel.
General Kohler did not tell me
You were so handsome.
What did General kohler tell you about me?
Nothing.
Whatever I want to know...
I'll find out for myself.
I'm very good at that.
Aren't you going to offer me a drink,
Or have you been at the front so long,
You have forgotten your manners?
What shall we talk about?
Your wife, perhaps?
Won't you join me?
I am told I'm an attractive woman.
You are not paying much attention to me.
Very little has escaped my attention.
General Kohler did tell me one thing.
What he admires most about you
Is your reputation with the ladies.
I regret that is the opinion of my commanding officer.
I have worked very hard
To achieve a reputation as a soldier.
Do not the two go together?
Give the general my compliments.
Tell him thank you,
I appreciate his gesture
And good night.
You can make your own way out.
Zero minus two hours.
All units ready to attack.
Repeat.
Zero minus two hours.
All units ready to attack.
Come with me.
Come on.
Put them down, dummkopf.
Hello, Kiley.
I was curious to see how you interrogate your prisoners.
My other officers may be asking the wrong questions.
I'm afraid you won't hear any new answers.
Sometimes it's more important what you see
Than what they say.
Could we get a little more light in here?
How is that, sir?
Hmm.
So this is the face of the undefeated enemy.
It looks you've captured
A sunday school class.
Is this all they have left.
For their front lines?
Where are their weapons?
Here, sir.
What's this?
Still has grease in the barrel.
It's never been fired.
Did they put up any fight? No, sir.
Just gave up?
Well, I'm not surprised.
They're only children.
Take a good look at them, Kiley.
They're not even tough enough
To be classified as delinquents.
Go ahead and question them.
Ask them if Germany's going to win the war.
Go ahead, Kiley.
They could be plants
Put in the front lines to misleas us.
I want to talk to you alone, Kiley.
Have these prisoners escorted to the rear for proper interrogation.
Yes, sir. Move them out.
Let's go! Move it out!
Sir, all these prisoners
Were carrying these rubber hoses.
Send them along and anything else you've found on them.
Yes, sir.
Do you actually still think
That the Germans are preparing a Major offensive?
Yes, sir, Colonel, I do.
You mean those kids you captured
Are just replacements for more seasoned troofps
Who were sent to the bear to re-form for the big attack?
Yes, sir, Colonel, I do.
Kiley, you're crazy.
Facts mean nothing to you.
Evidenge means nothing to you.
The only thing you can see
Are your own cock-eyed hunches.
Well, that doesn't work in the army.
I'm recommending you for transfer
To a desk in washington.
You can tell the president how to run
Major.
Speak English!
Ok, Lieutenant.
Let's get this stuff out of here.
Luftwaffe calling standard O.B.

Come on!

Turn them over! Let's go!

Soldier, did they give you basic training?
Here.
You do it this way.
They're green. Never seen action before.
What do you expect?
Sergeant, you're the anchorman here.
Nobody moves without orders.
Yes, sir.
You might as well stay here.
One more man won't make any difference.
I need to look inside a tiger.
Come on.
Hessler to standard O.B.

THE RISE OF LOUIS XIV
You're late
News from Vincennes; it seems the King is still there
When will he return?
He intends to stay there, our son-in-law says...
...close to the sick-bed of
Cardinal Mazarin
Our son-in-law! Always at the King's beck and call
His Majesty's best lackey
A King's only a man like any other
The English just chopped off their king's head; the world didn't end
No king; no palace.
No palace: no work for us
That's enough talking, we've got work to do.
More doctors going to Vincennes
We can’t even get a barber to bleed us if we're ill
We've been awaiting you.
His Eminence is gravely ill
I needed your opinion, my dear colleagues
Here are the colleagues I mentioned
Your Eminence
How do you feel?
I have difficulty in breathing
Dreadful bouts of stabbing pains
I would like to examine the...
Only a miracle...
Desiccation has set in
Gout, gravel...
Dropsy of the lung... He must be bled
But he was bled three times yesterday
Draw foul water from the well to make it sweet
The more a wet-nurse gives suck, the more milk she has
So it is with blood and bleeding
The body can lose thirty-five pints of blood without dying
So we can remain within reasonable limits
Nowadays we bleed patients in infancy and in advanced age
His Eminence is not yet sixty; we can but try
Rest assured, Your Eminence...
...with God's aid we shall do all in our power...
...to restore you to health
There's no hope
Is he insufficiently purged of evil humours ?
I administered rhubarb last night
These gentlemen have abandoned hope
You think the time has come ?
I think so
Perhaps a wet-nurse to suckle
His Eminence...
...as in the case of His Majesty
Or precious stones, perhaps
Is it worth trying ?
I've never tried them on a patient
So I must leave all this
My son, do not be afraid
Put your trust in Our Saviour's infinite mercy
But I feel no fear at all
That's what saddens me
I know I am going to die
I should tremble at the thought...
...of appearing before my Creator and Judge
Think of your sins
I think of this country, this Kingdom of France
This country I have chosen as mine
Perhaps that is why...
...you have served it better than many native Frenchmen
I believe I have served peace
In serving peace I have served my godson, the King
Perhaps it is because
I was born a Roman
All nations are children of Rome
Think of your sins
The gold, the money...
...the paintings and treasures you have accumulated...
...to whom will they go ?
My poor family
Was all this wealth honestly acquired ?
From the benefices of my sees and abbeys
Nothing unusual about that
Of course, but I don't mean ecclesiastical benefices...
...although twenty-three abbeys...
I mean civil appointments
A mere trifle
Take Brouage, for example
A busy port, but it brings me next to nothing
Not only Brouage
You are the chief shareholder in
La Campagnie du Nord
Since when has whaling been a dishonest trade ?
All offices may be bought
And have you not benefited ?
Come to the point, Monsieur Joly
What must I do to make my peace  with God?
What the King has given you, you may leave to your family
What you have given yourself, you must restore to the King
My family
I have no reason to be proud of them, despite my favours
But I cannot cheat God
Do you wish to confess?
Monsieur Colbert, His Eminence wishes to see you
My trusty Colbert
I shall have given you much work
It is hard for an orderly man like you...
...to serve a spendthrift such as I
I am content to serve His Eminence as best I can
It is a task, I fear...
...which will not occupy you much longer
But you have official standing
You may well cherish hopes
I have no wish to usurp anyone's position
I have never aspired to rise above my station
But Monsieur Fouquet...
Monsieur Fouquet, too, has served me well in his time
There is some truth in the report...
...which you submitted to me concerning his administration
His scandalous administration.
Exorbitant tax commissions...
...speculation, squandering of public funds
I know. But I returned the report to you...
...with orders to make peace with
Fouquet
The state owes him, personally, the sum of five million
He might feel entitled to succeed Your Eminence
He is intriguing already, I am told
The Queen Mother supports him
The Court is rife with intrigue since you fell ill
Courtiers hope for the return to power of the "favourite"
Pretty women imagine they'll rule the twenty-two year old King
Monsieur Fouquet is behind all these intrigues
All your Eminence's work could be destroyed in a few weeks
The spirit of our old opponents, the Fronde, is not dead
It could easily seize Fouquet and his friends...
...even though he supported you against the Fronde
Never at any time...
...has Fouquet pretended to care for the public good
In his circle the only concern is for public office
...influence to be bought, position to be won
If the King is not the man we alone seem to think he is...
If Fouquet becomes Prime Minister...
Well?
I will answer for nothing
What time is it ?
Not yet seven
Ask His Majesty...
...to visit me as soon as he rises
The Queen calls for something ?
No, she is informing us...
...that the King has this night performed his marital duty
How is His Eminence ?
His Eminence  wishes to see His Majesty
I wish to see His Eminence
Your Eminence, It is the King
Inform His Majesty I will receive him at once
His Eminence's rouge
Sire, His Eminence will receive you in a moment
Sire, I owe all to Your Majesty
I leave all to you
What do you mean?
My wealth, my property.
I have so decided, Sire
I may be the richest man in Europe...
...but I wish to die as though a pauper
This thought has always comforted me
All I beg is, Your Majesty...
...to be generous to my unfortunate family
I refuse
I refuse, Cardinal
I am touched by this token of your love for me
But it is in the name of the state
I represent...
...that I refuse
It is not your godson Louis who refuses: it is the King
Think, Sire, how your power would be increased...
...if you possessed such great wealth
I think also of public opinion...
...if it is known that this wealth comes from one of my subjects
Sire, you will be a great king
I die happy; you yourself are ready to govern
Listen to the advise of your ministers...
...use it if you so wish
And I think I acquit myself in full,
Sire...
...by leaving you Colbert
Spare yourself, Cardinal. Rest
To my mother's apartments
Monsieur Fouquet, have you come to enquire after our friend ?
I was grieved to learn that
His Eminence is at death's door
The Cardinal endures great suffering with admirable fortitude
I will receive you soon,
Monsieur Fouquet
Good day, Monsieur Le Tellier
What is it, Louis? You seem downcast
I have just spoken to Mazarin; for the last time, perhaps
Are you moved ?
I loved him and he loved me
You hated him
He saved my crown; but for him, the Fronde would have won
You called him "The Great Turk"
I was young; I copied other people
Have you no regret for this man's death ?
Yet you supported him against all France
Yes, even at the risk of losing your throne
But I deplore his ingratitude
He banished me from affairs of state.
He lacked respect
His insatiable passion for riches always frightened me
Forgive me, Madame; he was my only friend
The only person I could confide in, apart from you
I fear his death may mean a return to chaos
The security of your throne is assured
France is united behind her King.
The nobles are appeased
You think such senseless hatreds are so quickly forgotten?
I fear the Cardinal's death...
I am sure you will find a worthy successor to Mazarin
We have no lack of gifted nobles
Do you remember nothing mother?
The Fronde made you tremble, too
I was still a child, but some things are unforgettable
A prince of the Blood, leading my enemies
In January, 49, we were forced to flee by night...
...in a humble carriage, from the Louvre to Saint-Germain
We might have suffered the fate of my uncle in England
No, power is shared by too many opposing interests
The Cardinal cleverly balanced these forces...
...parliament, nobility, financiers, provinces
Even at Court I'm aware of little disinterested loyalty...
...and even my seemingly loyal subjects...
...are as much to be feared as the most rebellious
You will make yourself ill if you harbour such thoughts
In their greed, the nobles sell themselves to France's enemies
Even the Prince of Conde seeks Spanish aid
The nobles, no longer living on their lands...
...seek money from merchants
As in the time of the Fronde, they no longer sustain the Crown
They are in other hands, governed by base interests
Honour has become a commodity, like sugar and spice
Today we are suffering the effect of the sale of offices
Parliament, no longer content with its old privileges...
...seeks other powers
The English parliament delivers its master to the executioner
Ours might do the same and profane the divine right...
...since money alone holds power
Each must be content with his lot
That must be the order of things
Yes. Well ?
Forgive me, Madame
Forgive me, Madame, for having wearied you
He is still a child
Do you think he will ever forget the Cardinal's niece ?
She is engaged and will soon leave France
The King ignores her; he spends every night with the Queen
Pray God that continues
What are you thinking about,
Monsieur Le Tellier ?
About His Majesty's words
I must say, I couldn't really understand him
I was reminded of something he said a few days ago...
...after a Council presided over by His Eminence
His Majesty said to me:
"I want to govern, to attend Council every day, without fail "
He also said that he alone should have choice of action...
...in many circumstances...
...and provided that he lacked neither sense nor courage...
...none could make that choice better than the King
Have you ever heard of a King of France governing ?
Henry, perhaps. Catherine de' Medici, yes...
...but not her sons
At twenty, Francois I dreamt only of battles
His mother held the reins of power
His Majesty was not being serious
I swear I have never seen him more serious
What does it mean ?
You know the King as well as I do
Hunting, dancing, cards...
...those are his favourite pastimes
He was just showing off, that's all
Wait tonight in the Cardinal's apartments
Tell me at once if he dies, no matter what hour
The King is anxious about the Cardinal.
I will watch with you
-When did he die ?
-A few moments ago
We must tell the King
We have just lost a good friend
But take comfort, you have found a good master
Why does His Majesty not enter the Cardinal's room
It is not fitting that the King should be in contact with death
Monsieur Le Tellier, I shall return to Paris after dining
I will hold Council at the Louvre at seven tomorrow morning
I wish the Chancellor and the
Archbishop to attend too
I command the Court to observe full mourning
Sire, that is an honour reserved for the royal family
Full mourning
The Marechal was amazed when the King turned and said:
"We have just lost a good friend"
" But take comfort, you have found a good master"
It has pleased me, until now...
...to have my affairs governed by the late Cardinal
Now it is time that I governed
You will provide counsel when I seek it
I beg and order you, Chancellor...
...not to use the Royal Seal except by my order
I order you to sign nothing, not even a passport...
...without my consent
I wish you, Monsieur Fouquet, to employ Colbert...
...whom the late Cardinal recommended to me
As for Lionne, I am content with his services
Your Majesty ordered me to discuss
Church affairs with the Cardinal
-Whom should I deal with now?
-Myself, Archbishop
You know my wishes; it is for you to execute them
Well, gentlemen, this will make your task easier
The King is too fond of his pleasures; he'll soon tire of governing
Things will return to normal in a month or two
Monsieur Colbert, I confirm your appointment as Finance Administrator
Sire, I cannot express my gratitude...
Show the same zeal in great matters as you have in small
As a precaution, the Cardinal lodged sixteen millions in the Bastille
This money is not mentioned in his will
He considered it as belonging to the King
Sixteen million? This frees us from the financiers
You will come to work alone with me each evening
Tell no one. Secrecy is the prime virtue I require of my servants
I believe you understand that. I want to know if Fouquet understands, too
May I advise you, Sire, of a report and a secret thought...
...hitherto kept between myself and the Cardinal?
This is the report
And the thought?
I think Monsieur Fouquet will never grasp Your Majesty's intention...
...that it is time he put his accounts in order
Why should he? Disorder and confusion serve him better
His vanity and ambition know no bounds
His chateau at Vaux, built with money stolen from the state...
...is festooned with his coat of arms, a squirrel...
...with the motto:
"Where may I not climb?"
What exactly do you imply ?
The details are in my report...
...but among a thousand other frauds...
...I cite his extraordinate acquisition of unpaid promissory notes...
...which he later redeemed at their full value
It is reliably reported that he is fortifying Belle-Isle and Nantes
He has the soul of a Frondeur
We must not be hasty
My mother must be won over; she supports Fouquet
Yes, he often gives her gold, destined for her good works
I do not wish to endanger tax receipts by precipitate action
For the moment, Monsieur Fouquet remains a Council member
And the Queen Mother?
Cardinal Mazarin removed her from the
Council; will you restore her?
No
Your debauchery is unworthy of a Christian king
I am not averse to pleasure, but you abandon all restraint
When you were at Fontainebleau...
...you bathed naked in the river every day with your mistress
And Mignard had to paint the pair of you...
...as Apollo and a shepherdess, as if the Queen did not exist
I know why you do not want me in your Council
You fear I shall reproach your conduct
Have you lost all self-respect...
...all affection for your wife, for me?
You cannot imagine how you grieve me
Spurned by Mazarin, whose fortune
I made...
...I am now spurned by my son
Since you behave as though you have no mother...
...I shall retire to a convent, to Val de Grace
Forgive me, mother
Forgive me, Sire, but you must make a decision
I refer to the composition of the Council
Has Your Majesty decided?
The Queen Mother...
No change. Neither my mother nor my brother will attend Council
Do you enjoy hunting ?
Yes, it encourages intimacy; the King is quite at ease
As I said, he'll be easy to control if he can enjoy himself
Your speeches always begin with
"As I said..."
Will you never weary of always being right ?
Anyway, your imagination is running away with you
The King presides regularly at Council...
...and takes an interest in everything
His enthusiasm will be short-lived
I shall be Prime Minister within a month
If so, you must get rid of Colbert; he is a man to fear
Worry about that little provincial ?
Mademoiselle de la Valliere
...she is most important
Don't you know her ?
The Queen Mother calls her the” little seamstress from Tours"
Her father was an impoverished noble
She's well brought up, but unaccustomed to wealth
We shall easily win her over
How pretty, Madame
Not playing ?
I will bet for you
Seventeen; you lose
How is your game, Madame ?
Game! Will you never stop tormenting me?
-I don't understand
-You know what I mean
Not so loud
-Not playing?
-No I always lose
I must speak to you on behalf of
Monsieur Fouquet
He is impressed by your beauty and modesty
You may count on his generosity
As a token of his friendship...
...he begs you to accept a gift
Twenty thousand pistoles
Tell him his money cannot buy my complicity
Why are you trembling ?
Anger. Madame Du Plessis just offered me money
Twenty thousand pistoles from Monsieur Fouquet
So my first instinct was correct
This forces my hand...
...to what I have wished and feared so long
You did well to tell me
The next Council will be held at Nantes
The entire Court will leave within three days
I shall see you there.
Good night, Madame
Why the change? It's not what was decided at the last Council
There is something behind this
-Have your spies told you?
-About what ?
In your shoes, I'd fear the worst
You're imagining things. The king smiled graciously at you
No, the King is young...
...and tempted to demonstrate his power
No, you always look on the back side
He's visiting my domain as an act of homage to his prime servant
Sire, Your Majesty honours the City of Nantes
I wished to pay my respects
You will recover more rapidly if you rest
I hoped to find you alone, Sir, to give you this
I shall read it after.
Here is my mother
I want a word with you
I wanted you to know...
...that I will order my guard captain to arrest Fouquet
I called the Council at Nantes to ensure maximum effect
Louis, have you lost your senses?
My treasury is empty, revenue squandered two years in advance...
...the harvest is poor, my people fear another famine...
...yet in one day Fouquet spends more than I possess
His years of plunder and misappropriation from the realm
He is not afraid to flaunt his riches at me
Monsieur Fouquet is devoted to your service
My mind is made up
Arresting Monsieur Fouquet in his own province !
Beware, my son. You may revive the troubles of the Fronde
It will show me who is for and who is against me
My courts will deal with them
You frighten me
What a rotten place
You're always complaining; campaigning's not so bad
Who are we campaigning against ?
No Spaniards in Nantes
You'd better ask Monsieur d'Artagnan
In Paris we defend the King
-Do you see him every day?
-We ride before his carriage
His Majesty wishes to see you at once
He wishes to consider the duties of your company
Sire, Monsieur d'Artagnan is here
Your mission must be kept secret until it is accomplished
Then as many as possible must know of it
I am greatly honoured by
His Majesty's confidence...
Arrest Fouquet when he leaves the Council
Monsieur Colbert will give you detailed instructions
Take care to watch Fouquet after his arrest...
...lest he dispose of any papers
The prisoner will be taken to Angers, via Oudon
At Oudon you will get him to sign a document...
...surrendering Belle-Isle to the King
You may read the rest
Assure the King his orders will be faithfully executed
The next Council will be held at Vincennes
Monsieur Fouquet
I have something to say to you
No... it can wait until some other time
My courts, not I, will decide
Monsieur Fouquet's fate
But whatever happens, his office will fall in abeyance
The King must stand alone as the soul of his kingdom
It is not enough to lean on one, possibly loyal, person
All must depend on the King, as nature on the sun
The people must be assured of work and bread...
...so that misery does not ally them with new Frondeurs
We shall try to alleviate tolls and taxes
The nobles must again depend on the King for everything
Privileges, honours, money
This will keep them in our presence...
...away from the bourgeoisie...
...and absence from Court will be a misfortune worse than exile
Take care, Sire, that these measures are not too costly
The cost will be a fruitful investment
Merchants, craftsmen, bourgeois...
...will realize that prosperity depends on our enterprises
Our plans for building, factories, conquest of new territories...
...will result in great profits
This is my policy. Do you wish to serve it?
With all my soul
What means do you advise ?
Those you describe
We must give France the industry it lacks...
...producing all manner of goods
A fleet and an overseas empire...
...to free us from Holland's monopoly of maritime trade
People must be given work, not charity
Idle hands fall easy prey to troublemakers
We must dig canals, dig roads...
...breed horses for the army...
...combat famine, develop agriculture
We must reduce the tolls...
...which crush the peasantry...
...and introduce more equitable, indirect taxation
Customs dues, salt tax, concessions, tobacco...
This system permits, if Your Majesty wishes...
...relief for the underprivileged classes
And to increase revenue...
...a campaign against dishonest tax-collectors...
...and a firmer control on business transactions
Excellent. We shall adopt these measures
And velvet mantles. I wish to see the master-tailor
Do not forget; it is most important
We have faithfully followed
Your Majesty's commands
Not enough lace showing
That is better
Fouquet adopted this fashion; we shall make better use of it
For him it was mere display, not a political weapon
We will ensure that nobles think only of their doublets
In that way they will be best represented at Court
Now try on the wig
Darken the moustache to match
People are more easily governed through appearances than profundities
Does this style please Your Majesty ?
No, it is too plain. Start again
I shall be the first to dress thus; others will copy
Nobles must follow their King in all things
I have decided to keep the nobles away from Paris
Away from parliament and Fronde influence
I shall establish myself in my father's chateau at Versailles
Hitherto, nobles remained at Court at their own expense
Henceforth, they will be lodged and furnished at royal expense
Yet your generosity will not prevent them from incurring debts
With many opportunities for spending money, they will borrow
Let them
I will pay their urgent debts and thus bind them to me
As for those nobles who build houses at Versailles...
...I shall declare their mansions immune from attachment by law
That will attract them
They will answer to me, not to bourgeois money lenders
My father's chateau will be the temple of the monarchy
All the artists of the kingdom shall embellish it
Well, Monsieur le Vau?
Sire, duty obliges me to be brief
How is the work?
The masonry for the centre wing is ready
Plumbing and roofing almost complete...
...and soon a great deal of joinery will be ready
Your Majesty may judge the effect of the balustrades
Have you seen the paintings intended for the state rooms?
Nothing marks the greatness of princes so well as architecture
Posterity judges them by what they build
Versailles will stand as the palace of my dynasty
Remember this and spare no effort
Have you estimated how many the palace will accommodate?
Thirteen thousand, Sire
After the plans to accommodate fifteen thousand
When I am visited by the nobles of foreign princes...
...my palace must truly reflect the might of France
There is another modification,
Monsieur le Vau
Here, perfectly exposed to the sun...
...we shall build the greatest orangery in the world
Good day, Madame. I am well
Monsieur de Vardes,
I have recalled you
Sire, your recall to Court restores me to life
I am returned from the country,
Monsieur
Do you know you must salute no one in my presence?
I have forgotten everything, Sire.
Pardon my foolishness
I do so. But what is this costume?
Have you returned from China or the Americas?
Sire, when one is banished from your presence...
...one is not only unhappy, but ridiculous
Rise, and be assured of my regard
His Majesty begins the eighth course
Prepare the chicken.
And the baskets of fruit
Don't forget to prepare fresh breadcrumbs
Peas
What about the suckling pig?
The baskets of fruit
A little more sauce.
Garnish more generously
Is the pancake mixture ready?
A dozen with jam, two dozen each with chocolate and vanilla
The napkin, please, my brother
Music, please, my brother
The King's music!
Has the King never heard of the fork?
He disapproves of it
When he sees a fork used it throws him into a temper
I am thirsty
Monsieur de Lorrain
When I have eaten, we shall go to the kennels
And I will be pleased to see you at the hunt tomorrow
The King begins the fourteenth course
Form the cortege!
The King's meat !
I do not advise the pork, Your Majesty
Throw it away
I wish to be alone and undisturbed
There is a distinction which owes nothing to fortune
A certain air which seems to destine us to greatness
It is a prize which we imperceptibly assume
By this quality we command the deference of others...
...and it is rather this which raises us above them...
...than birth, honours, even merit
...than birth, honours, even merit
Neither sun nor death may be outfaced
Neither sun nor death may be outfaced

The days that we have seen!
Do you remember since we lay all night in the windmill...
...in St. George's field?
No more of that,
Master Shallow.
Ah! It was a merry night!
And is Jane Nightwork alive?
I think so.
- Doth she hold her own well?
- Old.
- Old, Master Shallow.
- Nay, certain she is old.
She must be old.
She had a child before
I came to...
...St. Clement's inn.
Jesu, the days that we have seen!
Sir John, said I well?
We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Robert Shallow.
That we have! That we have!
That we have! That we have!
Jesu, the days that we have seen!
"King Richard II, was murdered on behalf of the Duke...
...Henry Bollingbroke, say some, at the castle of...
...Pontefract, on 14th February, of the year 1400.
Before his death, the
Duke had been crowned.
And Edmund Mortimer, the true heir to the throne...
...was a prisoner of the
Welsh rebels.
The new king was in no hurry to pay for his ransom...
...and to prove this, Mortimer's cousins, the Percys...
...set off to Windsor, to see the King.
Northumberland...
...his son, Henry Percy, surnamed "Hotspur"...
...and Worcester, whose idea, was always to act maliciously...
...and to plot against them."
Shall we buy treason?
- My lord...
- No, let him starve.
For I shall never hold that man my friend...
...whose tongue shall ask me to ransom home revolted Mortimer!
Revolted? He never did fall off my lord's liege, but by war.
Till now, I have remain'd cold blooded before these iniquities...
...but, I tell thee, I shan't remain thus much longer a time.
Our family, my lord...
...deserves not the harshness of your rage...
...for thou art support'd, by our greatness and our weapons...
...to be seated on this throne.
- Worcester, leave us, I say!
For your eyes, speak of plots, resentment and obedience not.
- Lord...
- What else?
Let me not hear you speak of
Mortimer, or you shall hear in...
...such a kind from me as will displease you.
- Hear me, my lord.
- Lord Northumberland...
...we license you depart with...
...your son.
Speak of Mortimer! Zounds I will speak of him, and let my soul...
...want mercy if I join him not.
- Nephew, pray listen to me.
Did King Richard then proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer...
...heir to the crown?
- He did, myself did hear it.
Nay, then I can not blame his cousin, that wish'd him starve.
Shall it, for shame, be spoken in these days, or fill up chronicle...
...in time to come, that men of your nobility and power...
...did gage them both in an unjust behalf?
God pardon it!
To put down Richard, that sweet, lovely rose...
...and plant this thorn, this canker, Bollingbroke.
- Say no more.
- By heavens, me thinks it were...
...an easy leap to dive into the bottom of the deep, where...
...fathom-line could never touch the ground and pluck up...
...drown'd honour by the locks, than to bear so vile a king!
Farewell, I'll talk to you when you are better temper'd to attend.
Leave not! What can I do if nettled and stung with pismires...
...I get, when I hear of this vile polititian, Bollingbroke?
In Richard's time, what do ye call the place, where I first...
...bow'd my knee unto this king of smiles, this Bollingbroke?
When you and he came back from Ravenspurg!
You say true.
What a candy deal of courtesy this greyhoud then did proffer!
And, gentle Harry Percy, my kind cousin.
- O, the devil take such cozeners.
- Say no more, let us be wise.
God forgive me, good uncle, tell your tale, for I have done.
- Nay, if you have not, to't again.
- I have done already.
Secretly into the bossom creep of that some noble prelate, well...
...belov'd, the archbishop.
- Of York, it's not?
Good blow against the king!
And then the power of Scotland...
...and of York to join with
Mortimer, ha?
And so they shall. Farewell, good brother, no further go in this.
- I by letter shall direct you.
- We shall thrive, I trust.
One thing I shall do, pursue and fight that Bollingbroke!
And that some sword-and- buckler Prince of Wales...
...he, who cares not that his father loves him not.
I'd have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
- And Falstaff?
- Fast asleep.
And snorting like a horse.
- I have taken his purse.
- And what hast thou found?
Nothing but papers, my lord.
- What time of day is it, lad?
- What a devil hast thou to do...
...with the time of the day?
Unless hours were cups of sack...
...and minutes capons, and cocks the tongue of bawds, and dials...
...the sign of leaping houses, and blessed sun himself a fair hot...
...wench in flame-coloured taffeta.
I see no reason why thou hast to know the time of day.
Indeed, Hal.
For we that take purses, go by the moon.
Who the devil hast robbed me?
Hostess!
Hostess!
- What dost want thou?
- My pocket was picked!
Why, Sir John, what do you think that I keep thieves in my house?
- Leave! I know thee, even now!
- I know you, Sir John!
You owe me money, and now you pick a quarrel to belique me of it.
This house's turned bawdy-house.
- A bawdy-house sayest thee?
- Yea, and they pick pockets!
But for having 12 or 14 maidens who live honestly...
...by sewing, thou sayest I own a bawdy-house. What a world!
Canst one sleep fearing not for the fate of one's purse?
Sir John, you owe money here!
What didst thou lose, Jack?
- 'Tis no trifle offence, some' 40.
- What sayest thou?
And a seal ring of my grandfather's, worth 40 mark.
You owe so much money, Jack, you hath forgotten.
1st: A capon, 2s. 2d.
Sauce, 4p.
Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8p.
Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.
- Bread, 0s. 1/2 d.
- O monstrous!
Come, don't burden me with thou ill mood.
I forgive thee.
I'll have some sack!
God forgive thee for it.
Before I knew thee, I knew nothing, and now am I...
If a man should speak truly, little better than of the wicked.
I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be, enough.
Swore little, diced not above seven times a week, went to...
...a bawdy-house not above once in a quarter... of an hour.
Company, villanous company hath been the spoil of me.
An I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made...
...of, I am a pepper-corn, a brower's horse, a church!
Well, I repent.
- Where shall we take a purse?
- Where thou wilt, Ned.
I see a good amendement in thee, from praying to purse-taking.
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, 'tis no sin for a man to labour in it.
My lads, to-morrow morning, early, at Gadshill...
...there are pilgrims going to
Canterbury, with rich offerings...
...and traders riding to London with fat purses.
- Hal, wilt thou make one?
- Who, I rob? Not I, by my faith!
There's neither honesty, manhood nor good fellowship in thee.
Nor thou comest not of the blood royal, if thou darest not...
...stand for 10 shillings.
- It likes me not to go.
I'll be a traitor, then, when thou art king.
I care not.
My lord, I have a jest to execute, that I cannot do alone.
My dear prince!
Come, dost brood not over it!
I'll go with thee.
A booty shalt it be for all!
Provide us all things necessary.
Farewell, my lord.
- Farewell.
- Hal...
...when thou art king, let not us be called...
...thieves of the day's beauty, let us be Diana's foresters...
...gentlemen of the shade.
Let men say, we be men...
...of good government, being governed, as the sea is...
...by the moon, whose countenance we steal.
I know thee well,
I wilt join you in thy...
...errands for a while.
I would I be the sun, who lets horrid clouds, hide...
...away its beauty, until he wantest to show it in all...
...its splendour and grandeur, being thus more admired...
...for it hast taken a longer time to show itself.
If all the year, a holiday it were, pleasure woulst become as...
...tiresome as duty, but as holidays be few, we long for them...
That day when I fail to live a rash life, to pay a debt...
...that was never mine own, the surprise of them, my subjects...
...wilt be greater, my amendment in life so sudden, that it shalt...
...be all the more admired and reckon'd.
My amendment, after my sins, shalt be more worthy.
But, shall there be gallons in England when thou art king?
Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
No, thou shalt. Thou shalt become a brave hangman.
"The purpose you undertake is dangerous."
That's certain, 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink...!
- Henry...
- I tell thee, you vile coward...
...out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower safely.
- Henry...
- "The purpose is dangerous...
...the friends you hath named uncertain, the time itself...
...unsorted, and all your whole plot too light."
Say you so, say you so?
I say unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind!
By the Lord! Our plot is a good plot...
...as ever was laid.
A good plot with true and constant friends.
- Goeth you.
- Must I leave you, Kate...
...what a frosty-spirited rogue this is!
In respect of the love he bears our house, he shows in this.
He loves his own barn better than he loves our house!
Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
What horse, my lord?
A roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
That roan shall be my throne!
- What letters hast thou there?
- From thy father.
- Why comes he not himself?
- He's grievous sick.
How has he the leisure to be sick in such a justling time?
You shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and cold heart...
...will he to the king, and lay open all proceedings.
Hang him...!
For what offence have I this fortnight been a banish'd...
...woman from my Harry's bed?
In thy faint slumbers I, by thee have watch'd and heard thee...
...murmur tales of iron wars, speak terms of manage to thy...
...bounding steed;
Courage, to the field!
And thou hast talk'd of sallies and retics, of trenches, tents...
...of palisadoes, cannon, culverin, of soldiers slain, ransom and fight.
Yea, fights!
But hear you, my lord.
- My lord!
- What say'st thou, my lady?
- What is it, carries you away?
- Why, my horse, my love.
In faith, I'll know your business!
But if you go...
So far a foot, I shall be weary, love.
In faith I'll break thy finger, an if thou wilt not tell me...
...all things true.
- Away, you triffler!
Love? I love thee not.
I care not for thee.
This is no time to kiss, but for bloody noses and crack'd crowns.
Gods me, my horse!
Do you not love me?
Do you not, indeed?
Nay, tell me if you speak in jest, or no.
Come, wilt thou see me ride?
And when I am o'horseback...
...l'll swear
I love thee infinitely!
I know you wise, but yet no further wise...
...than Harry Percy's wife.
Constant you are, but...
...yet a woman.
And for secrecy no lady closer for I well believe, that thou...
...wilt not utter what thou dost not know...
...and so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
- How! So far?
- Not an inch further.
Wither I go, thither shall you go too.
- Will this content you?
- It must, of force.
How long it's ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?
My... own knee?
When I was about thy years, I was not an eagle's talon in the...
...waist, a plague of sighing and grief it blows a man up.
- Here comes the king's money.
- 'Tis going to his exchequer.
- My friends, the purpose is clear.
- Halt!
- You four shall front them.
- How many be there of them?
- Some eight or ten.
- Zounds, will they not rob us?
Give me my horse.
To thy tasks.
If they shalt escape your attack, they shalt fall unto our trap.
8 yards of uneven ground is 70 miles a foot with me.
I have removed his horse.
If I travel further, I shall break my wind.
I'll starve, are I'll rob a foot further!
Whew! A plague upon you all!
Lie down!
Lie down, close to the ground, and list if thou canst hear...
...the tread of travellers.
Have you any levers to lift me up again?
They art coming.
I pr'ythee, good prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king's son.
Shall I be your ostler?
Go hang thyself in thine own heir apparent garters!
Come on!
Come, the boy shall lead our horses down the hill;...
...we'll walk a-foot awhile, and ease our legs.
Cut the villains' throats!
- For obtaining of suits?
- Here.
Life hast been made for the young, old fool!
Come, come.
Come, my masters, let us share.
An the prince and Ned be not two cowards, there's no equity...
...stirring. There's no more value in that, than in a wild duck.
Your money villains!
The thieves are scatter'd, and possess'd with fear!
Each takes his fellow for an officer.
Falstaff sweats to death, and lards the earth as he walks.
We're not for laughing,
I should pity him.
None knowest the faring of mine strayed son, Harry?
- I hath seen him not for months.
- My lord.
- Did thou read the letters I sent?
- Yes, my lord.
Our kingdom is sick, a serious disease spreads over it.
Percy and Lord art supported by
50,000 men, they say.
Here comes Lord Rham.
Lord Northumberland is sick, but a great army of...
...Englishmen and Scots, follows Henry Percy.
My pride be wounded by envy.
I envy that Lord Northumberland should be the father...
...to so blest a son.
The very straightest plant.
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him, see riot and...
...dishonour stain the brow of my young Harry.
O that it could be prove'd that some night-tripping fairy had...
...exchang'd in craddle-clothes our children, where they lay...
...then I would have his Harry, and he mine.
- Where is the Prince of Wales?
- We know not, my lord.
Pray God they find him soom!
Ask in London, search the inns...
...they say he visits the taverns...
...with shady characters...
...who hidest in alleys to attack some...
...wardens, they pick-pocket our subjects.
My son, who is an affeminate fool...
...wantest to bet his honour by pervenrting that vile crowd.
Easy victory!
The virtue of this jest will be the incomprehensible lies...
...that this same fat rogue will tell us.
How 30, at least, he fought with what wards, what blows...
...what extremities he endured to defeat them all.
A plague of all cowards!
A plague of all cowards!
I say, and a vengeance too!
Give me a cup of sack, boy.
- Where hast thou been, Jack?
- A plague of all cowards!
Go thy ways, old Jack, die when thou wilt.
If manhood be not forgot upon the face of the earth...
...then I am a shotten herring.
There live not three good men unhanged in England...
...and one of them is fat and grows old; God help the wicked!
What mutter you, woolsack?
A king's son!
If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath...
...and drive all the subjets afore thee like a flock of wild geese...
...l'll never wear hair on my face any more. Prince of Wales.
- Why, you whoreson round man.
- Vile fat man!
What's the matter?
Are you not a coward? Answer.
And ye call me a coward?
Ye fat paunch!
Dost I call thee coward?
I'll see damned ere I call you coward, but I would give...
...a thousand pound, I could run as fast as thou canst.
What's the matter?
There be four of us here have ta'en a thousand pound this day?
- A thousand, where is it?
- Where is it, Jack?
Where? Taken from us it is.
- A hundred upon poor four of us.
- What, a hundred, man?
If I were not at half-sword with a dozen...
...of them two hours together,
I have'scaped by miracle.
I am eight times thrust through the doublet...
...my buckler cut through, my sword hacked like a hand-saw.
- How was it?
- We four set upon some dozen!
Sixteen at least.
And bound them, we were sharing, 6 or 7 men set upon us.
- What, fought ye them all?
- Lf I fought not with fifty of...
...them, I am a bunch of radish.
If there were not upon...
...poor Jack, then I am no two-legged creature.
Pray God, you have not murdered some of them.
Nay, that's past praying for.
I have peppered two of them, two I am sure I have paid.
Two rogues in buckram suits, if
I tell thee a lie, Hal, spit in...
...my face, and call me horse.
I acted a true man.
Four rogues in buckram let drive at me.
- What, four?
- Thou saidst but two even now.
Four, Hal, I told thee four.
These four came all a-front.
I made no more ado but took all their seven points in my target...
...thus!
- Seven?
Why, there were but four...
- In buckram suits?
- Ay, in dark buckram suits.
Seven, by these hilts or I am a villain else.
Let him alone, we shall have more anon.
- Dost thou hear me, Hal?
- Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
Do so, for it is worth listening to.
- These nine I told thee of...
- So, two more already.
...began to give me ground, but
I came in foot and hand...
...and with a thought...
...seven of the eleven... I paid.
- They are eleven now.
But as the devil would have...
...it three misbegotten knaves in green, came at my back...
...and let drive at me.
For it was so dark, Hal, that...
...thou couldst not see thy hand.
- These lies are like...
...the father that begett'd them.
Why, thou clay-brained guts...
...thou non patted fool, thou whoreson...
...obscene, swine...
- What, art thou mad?
- Is not the truth, the truth?
- Why, how couldst thou know...
...this men in green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see?
- Come, tell us your reason.
- Come, your reason, Jack.
What, upon compulsion?
No, were I at the strappado.
I would not tell you on compulsion.
I'll be no longer guilty of this sin, this sanguine coward.
This horse back-breaker, this huge hill of flesh!
Away you, starveling!
You elf-skin...
...you dried neat's tongue!
O for breathe to utter what is like thee!
You tailor's yard, you seath, you bow-case, you vile stuck!
Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again.
We two saw you four set on four;...
...mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.
Falstaff, you carried your guts away as nimbly and still...
...ran and roared, as ever
I heard a bull-calf.
What a slave art thou to hack sword as tho hast done...
...and say it was in fight. What trick canst thou now find out...
...to hide thee, from this shame?
- Jack, what trick hast thou now?
By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
Was it for me to kill the heir apparent?
Why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules, but...
...beware instinct. The lion will not touch the true prince.
I was a coward on instinct.
- I am glad you have the money.
- My lord, my prince!
Marry, my lord, there is a noble man would speak with you.
What's the matter?
He comes on behalf of thy father.
Give him as much as thee canst, and send him back to my mother.
- What manner of man is he?
- An old man.
What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight?
- Shall I give him answer?
- Pr'ythee, do, Ned.
Lock the doors, keep vigil to-day and pray to-morrow...
...lads, dost you want to enjoy?
- Lets put up a comedy.
- A comedy?
Thou wilt be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comes to...
...thy father, if you love him, practise an answer.
- Do thou stand for my father.
- Shall I? Content.
This chair shall be my state, and this cushion... my crown.
Twas Sir Thomas Gracey.
Bad news, they sayest...
...that Hotspur of the North...
- Percy.
He that kills me some six or seven dozen Scots at a breakfast...
...and says to his wife. Fie upon this quiet life! I want work.
Couldst anyone more fear'd be though off?
Doth not thy blood thrill?
Art thou not horribly afraid?
Not a whit, i'faith, I lack some of thy instinct.
Give me a cup of sack to make mine eyes look red...
...that it may be thought I have wept, for I must speak in passion.
Harry...
...I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time...
...but also how thou art accompanied.
He doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever I see!
Quiet, hostess!
That thou art my son, I have...
...partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion...
...but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye, and a foolish...
...hanging of thy nether lip.
Why, being son to me...
...art thou so pointed at?
There is a thing, which thou hast often heard of...
...the pitch, doth defile, so doth the company thou keepest.
And yet, there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted...
...in thy company,
I know not his name.
What manner of man...?
A goodly portly man, and a corpulent, of a cheerful look...
...a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage.
As I think his age, some 50 or 60...
...and now I remember me, his name is...
Falstaff.
If that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me...
...for I see virtue in his looks, him keep with...
...the rest banish.
- Dost thou speak like a king?
Do thou stand for me, and I'll play my father.
Depose me?
- Well, here I am set.
- And here I stand.
- Harry, whence come you?
- My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
They are false. I'll trickle ye for a young prince, i'faith.
There is a devil haunts thee, in the likeness of a fat old man...
...a tun of man is thy companion.
Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours...
...that bolting-hutch of beastliness...
...that huge bombard of sack...
...that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that ox that reverend vice...
...that father ruffian, that vanity in years?
Wherein is he good?
But to taste sack and drink it!
Wherein is he useful?
But to carve a capon and eat it.
Wherein cunning, but in craft?
Wherein crafty, but in villany?
Wherein villanous, but in all things?
Wherein worthy, but in nothing?
Whom means Your Grace?
That villanous abominable misleader of youth.
That old white beard Satan.
- My lord, the man I know.
- I know thou dost.
But to say I know more harm in him than in myself, is a lie.
That he is old, his white hairs do witness it.
But that he is, saving your reverence, an old Satan...
...that, I utterly deny!
If sack and sugar be a fault,
God help the wicked!
If to be old and merry, be a sin, then many I know is damned.
If to be fat, to be hated, many a monk shalt be burnt.
No, my lord, banish Peto, banish Bardolph...
...banish Poins, but for sweet Falstaff...
...kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff...
And therefore more valiant
Jack Falstaff...
...being as he is old
Jack Falstaff...
...banish not him thy
Harry's company.
Banish plump Jack... and banish all the world!
I do.
I will
- O, my lord, my lord!
- What's the matter?
The sheriff and all the watch are come to search the house.
Out, you rogue! I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
Go hide. Now, my masters, for a true face and good conscience.
Both which I have had, but their date is out, and so I hide me.
What is your will with me, master sheriff?
First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry hath followed men here.
What men?
One of them is well known a gross fat man.
As fat as butter!
The man, I do assure you, is not here, let me entreat you leave.
I will, my lord.
There are two gentlemen have in this robbery lost 300 mark.
If he have robb'd these men, he shall be answerable.
- Farewell.
- Good-night, my lord.
I'll to the court in the morning, we must all to the wars.
Good-night, my noble lord.
I think it is good-morrow, is it not?
Indeed, my lord.
We shall have to fight, ha?
Hostess, make ready breakfast.
You owe me money, Sir John!
- I lent thee some 23 pound.
- Go, you thing, go.
Say, what thing?
I am an honest man's wife and...
...setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to call me so.
Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say other.
- Say, what beast, thou knave?
- What beast?
- Why, an otter.
- An otter, sir John?
Why an otter?
Neither fish nor flesh, a man not knows where to have' her.
Thou know what thou sayest!
Thou, or any man knows where to have me. Thou knave, thou!
Thou sayest true, he slanders thee most grossly.
So he doth you, my lord.
And said this other day that you ought him 1,000 pound.
- Do I owe you 1,000 pound?
- A million pound, a million.
Thy love is worth a million.
Thou owest me thy love.
My sweet Jack, I must still be good angel to thee.
My lord, he'd call you an ass and a crafty...
...he would cudgel you.
- Did you?
As thou art man, I dare, but as thou art prince...
...I fear thee, as I fear the lion's whelp.
- Why not as the lion?
- The king is to be feared thus.
Dost thou think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father?
The money is paid back again.
O, I do not like that paying back: 'tis a double labour.
Whoreson!
Thou tender sucking pig...
...hungry bear!
Come, let's be friends, Jack.
Thou shalt go to wars, and who knowest we shalt meet again.
Who carest?
Farewell, fat Jack.
Farewell, winter rose!
Percy, Northumberland...
...the archbishop of York,
Douglas, Mortimer...
...capitulate against us.
But, wherefore do I tell thee of my foes...
...which are my near'st and dear'st enemy?
To fight against me under
Percy's pay...
...to dog his heels, and court'sy at his frowns...
...to show how much thou art degenerate.
Lords, give us leave.
The Prince of Wales and I must have some conference.
I know not whether God will have it so...
...for some displeasing service
I have done...
...that is his secret doom, out of my blood...
...He'll breed a scourge for me.
Tell me else...
...could such inordinate and low desires, such poor, such bare...
...rude society, accompany...
...the greatness of thy blood?
- I beg Your Majesty...
Hath faulty wander'd and irregular so common-hackney'd...
...in the eyes of men's opinion, that did help me to the crown...
...I should be deposed.
None lovest a king who goest with shallow jesters...
...mingled his royalty with carping fools.
He was but the cuckoo is in June, heard, not regarded...
...seen but with such eyes, as sick and blunted with...
...community, afford no gaze, such as is bent on sun-like majesty...
...when it shines seldom in admiring eyes.
And that line, stand'st thou.
For thou hast lost thy princely privilege with vile participation.
Not an eye but is a-weary of thy common sight.
Save mine, which hath desire'd to see thee more.
I shall hereafter, my thrice- gracious lord, be more myself.
As thou art to this hour, was Richard then...
...when I from France set foot at Ravenspurg...
...and even as I was then is Percy now!
Now, by my sceptre, and my soul to boot...
...he hath more worthy interest to the State than thou.
Do not think so.
I will redeem all this on Percy's head, and in the closing...
...of some glorious day, be bold to tell you that I am your son.
And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights...
...that this same child of honour and renown, this gallant Hotspur...
...and your unthought-of
Harry, chance to meet.
I shall make this northern youth exchange...
...his glorious deeds for my indignities...
...this is the name of God,
I vow here.
The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day...
...three days aft, thou shall set forward.
- Damn!
- Damn you, woolsack!
We must war together, why use daggers against eachother?
Thou vipers, thou!
I am Pistol, if thou darest load me, I'll shoot.
Pay the 8s. I won from thou playing bowls.
- He who payset is a vile slave.
- Swine!
Who is it who flees?
- Falstaff, Your Highness.
- The one involved in the theft?
O, my lord, the Judge.
I heard thou was sick...
...I would you have come out under doctor's orders.
Thy youth is not over yet, but thou art old...
...and thou canst feel the action of time on thyself...
...pray, take care of thyself.
Westmoreland, my lord!
I thought thou had been at Shrewsbury.
'This time for us both to be there.
What, is the king encamped?
He is, and I fear we shall stay too long.
Sir John, I did never see such pitiful rascals.
Methinks they are poor - bare.
If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused gurnet.
I have misused the king's press damnably...
...they have bought out their services...
...and now my whole change consists of revolted tapsters...
...and ostlers tradefallen...
...cankers of a calm world and long peace.
- Falstaff, we must leave.
- The king looks for us all.
- Cometh you with the Prince?
- You follow him from here to...
...there, hence an evil spirit.
- You hast perverted the prince.
- He did so to me.
- You lead a vile life.
Thy means are slender, and thy waste is great.
I would it be otherwise! My means greater, but my waist not.
The white hairs on thy face, should maketh thou...
...learn the graveness.
- The fat... the fat.
You, that are old consider not the capacities of us...
...thou measure thy ardousness against the roughness of thy skin.
- Dost thou think thyself young?
- All in thou art old.
Have you not a moist eye?
A dry hand? A yellow cheek?
- A white beard?
- A decreasing leg?
A broken voice when tired?
And thy faculties ruin'd through old age?
- Even so, thou call thyself young?
- I was born at three in the...
...afternoon carrying a white head, a round belly, the voice I lost...
...in singing and hollaing.
Sir John, you must recruit more soldiers in other counties...
...we must leave at once!
- Set forth!
Pray be humble, and pray
God to protect thy men.
Will you give me 1,000 pound for my men?
Lay out, lay out.
Fare you well.
- My lord...
- Not one pence.
- Bardolph, give me a cop os sack.
- Will you give me money?
Pray God he giveth a good ally to the prince!
Pray Heavens above he giveth the ally a good prince.
- What news?
- The Earl of Westmoreland...
...strong, is marching hitherwards with Prince John.
No harm, what more?
- The king himself is set forth.
- He shall be welcome too!
Where is his son, the nimble- footed madcap Prince of Wales...
...and his comrades, that daff'd the world aside and bid it pass?
All furnish'd, all in arms. By the lord, cousin, wait for help!
Gentlemen, life is always short...
...but, if lived cowardly, it would prove far too long...
...even if it lasted one hour.
If we dost live, it is to tread on king's heads.
If we are to die, it shall be beautiful, if we die with princes.
- Justice Shallow?
- I am, a poor knight...
...from this same county, and one of the king's peace justices.
My captain sends regards.
My captain, Sir John Falstaff...
...a handsome knightand a brave captain.
Welcome, sir.
Davy?
I thinkest...
Soldiers art coming...
Take good care of them, for they art but axes knives.
Let them use them on themselves, for they come looking shaby.
Why, Davy, how funny!
O, sir,! Go away!
Give me your hand, highness.
- Welcome, sir John.
- Master Robert Shallow...
...I am glad to see thou again.
Thy house is beautiful.
You shall see mine orchard...
...we'll eat a last year's pippin of my own graffing.
With a dish of carraways.
Have you provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?
Marry, have we, sir.
Let's see. Where's the roll?
Davy!
Robert Shallow...
I do remember him at
Clement's...
...like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring.
When he was naked, he was like a forked radish, he was...
...the very genious of famine, yet lecherous as a monkey.
And now, this Vice's dagger, become a squire, and now has...
...he land and beeves.
I will be acquainted with him.
A friend i'the court is better than a penny in purse, take care.
Let me see! Let them appear as I call.
Master Surecard, as I think?
- Er...
- Silence!
Sir John, it is my cousin Silence in comission with me.
Good Master Silence, it well befits you'd be of the peace.
The very same, Sir John.
Your Highness...
I would break Skogan's head at school when a child!
And the very same day,
I'd hit a Sampson Stockfish...
...a fruiterer, behind Gray's inn.
Jesu, the mad days I have spent!
Master Silence, let's see those men, Master Silence.
Name them in order, cousin.
Quick!
Mouldy.
- Mouldy?
- Yes, my lord.
It is time you were spent.
Mouldy!
Things that are mouldy, lack use.
Prick him.
You need not to have pricked me...
...my old dame'll be undone now for one to do the drudgery.
- Prick him.
- Prick him!
- Thomas Wart.
- Here, sir.
- There are other men fitter.
- Stand aside, Mouldy.
- Is Wart good enough, sir?
- His apparel is built upon his...
...back, prick him no more.
- Then, Simon Shadow.
Shadow? Shadow will serve good for summer.
You can do it, sir!
Prick him.
Let's see another.
Francis Feeble, cousin!
- What trade art thou, Feeble?
- A woman's tailor, sir.
Wilt thou make as many holes in an enemy's battle as thou...
...hast done in a woman's robe?
- I'll do my good, but no more.
Well said!
Well said, courageous Feeble!
Thou wilt be as valiant as a magnanimous mouse!
Prick the woman's tailor,
Master Silence.
Prick him, Master Silence.
- Who is next?
- Peter Bullcalf of the Green!
O lord, my lord captain.
Dost thou roar before thou art pricked?
- O, lord, sir! I'm a diseased man.
- What disease has thou?
A cough, sir, which I caught with ringing...
...in the king's affairs upon his coronation day.
We will have away thy cold, and thy friends shall ring for thee.
Prick him.
- Is here all?
- Here's more than your number.
- Good master corporal Captain...
- Go to, stand aside.
I had as lief be hanged, as go to war.
Sir captain...
- Here is four French crowns.
- Stand aside.
You shall have 40, sir. For my old dame's sake, she has...
...nobody when I am gone.
- Go to, stand aside.
Let it go which way it will.
Sir, I have three pound to free
Mouldy and Bullcalf.
Mouldy, stay at home till you are past service.
Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it.
- But they are your likeliest men.
- Will you tell me how to choose?
Wart, he shall charge you and discharge you with the motion...
...of a pewterer's hammer, and this half-faced fellow, he...
...presents no mark to the enemy and for a retreat, how swiftly...
...will this Feeble, the woman's tailor, run off.
O, give me the spare men...
...and spare me the great one
Fare you well.
- Sir John, Heaven bless you.
- Fare you well.
- Bardolph, get new sticks.
- There are none.
Give the soldiers clothes.
Heaven bless you, Sir John!
And prosper your affairs!
And send us peace!
How now, Worcester! 'Tis not well that you and I...
...should meet upon such terms, you have deceiv'd our trust...
...and made us doff our easy robes of peace, to crush our...
...old limbs in ungentle steel; this is not well, my lord.
My liege, I do protest, I have not sought the day of this dislike.
- How comes it, then?
- Rebellion lay in his way...
...and he found it.
- Peace, chewet, peace.
Tell your nephew, the Prince of Wales, doth join...
...with all the world in praise of Henry Percy, I do not think...
...a braver gentleman, more bold and daring.
I say it to my shame. I have a truant been to chivalry.
Yet, this before my father's majesty, I am content that he...
...shall take the odds of his great name and will, to save the...
...blood of more Englishmen.
We love our people well, even those that are misled...
...upon us and will they take the offer of our grace...
...every man shall be my friend again, and I'll his.
We offer fair.
Take it advisely.
It will not be accepted, on my life.
God befriend us, as our case is just.
Pray Harry hears not the king's offer.
What sayest to thee?
There is no seeming mercy in the king.
He calls us rebels, traitors, and will scourge.
Arms, gentlemen; to arms!
Soldiers, comrades, every leader to his charge.
I aswear to thee I shall stain this sword with the best blood!
The Prince of Wales said before the king, he would defy you...
...you in battle.
- Lf it were to befall upon...
...the Prince of Wales and myself,
I would be ready to even die.
- I would I could sleep now.
- Why, thou owest God a death.
'Tis not due yet; I would be lothe to pay Him before his day.
What need I be so forward with Him that calls not on me?
But that matters not, for honour pricks me.
But how if honour prick me off when I come on? How then?
Can honour set-to an arm, or take away the grief of a wound?
Hath it no skill in surgery?
What is honour?
Air, only air. Who hath it?
He that died on Wednesday, doth he feel it? No.
Is it insensible, then?
Yea, to the dead...
...but will it not live with the living? No.
Detraction will not suffer it, therefore I'll none of it.
Honour is a mere scutcheon, and so end my catechism.
Come, let me taste my horse, against the Prince of Wales!
Harry to Harry shall, not horse to horse...
...meet, and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
Good night, Pat.
Good night.
What happened to the old bank?
It was beautiful.
People kept robbing it.
That's a small price to pay for beauty.
Hit me.
Again.
Bust!
Give me credit,
Mr. Macon?
You know my rules, Tom.
Well, it looks like you just about cleaned everybody out, fella.
You haven't lost a hand since you got the deal.
What's the secret of your success?
Prayer.
Let's just you and me play.
Hit it.
Bust.
Yeah, you're a hell of a card player, fella.
I know, 'cause I'm a hell of a card player, and I can't even spot how you're cheating.
The money stays, and you go.
Well, we seem to be a little short on brotherly love around here.
If you're with him, you better get out of here.
We're on our way.
I wasn't cheating.
Come on.
I wasn't cheating!
You can die.
You can both die.
You hear that?
If he invites us to stay, then we'll go.
He's got to invite us to stick around.
He'll draw on you.
You don't know how fast he is.
I'm over the hill, but it can happen to you.
That's just what I want to hear.
Every day you get older.
That's a law.
What would you think about maybe asking us to stick around?
What?
You don't have to mean it or anything.
Just ask us to stick around.
I promise...
I can't help you,
Sundance.
I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating.
I draw on you, you'll kill me.
There's that possibility.
You'd be killing yourself.
Why don't you just invite us to stick around?
You can do it... and easy.
Come on.
Come on.
Why don't you stick around?
Thanks, but we got to get going.
Hey, Kid.
Hey, Kid, how good are you?
Like I been telling you... over the hill.
Boy, you know, every time I see
Hole-In-The-Wall, it's like seeing it for the first time.
Every time, I ask myself the same question... how can I be so damn stupid to keep coming back?
What's your idea this time?
Bolivia.
What's Bolivia?
Bolivia... that's a country, stupid.
Central or
South America.
One or the other.
Let's go to Mexico instead.
All they got in Mexico is sweat.
There's too much of that here.
If we'd been in business during the California gold rush, where would we have gone?
California, right?
When I say Bolivia, you just think California.
You wouldn't believe what they're finding in the ground down there.
They're just falling into it.
Silver mines, gold mines, tin mines.
Payrolls so heavy we'd strain ourselves stealing them.
You just keep thinking,
Butch.
That's what you're good at.
Boy, I got vision, and the rest of the world wears bifocals.
Hi, News.
What you doing?
Aw, howdy, Butch.
Uh, nothing.
Nothing.
Howdy, Sundance.
You sure are. You're doing something. What?
Just fixing to rob the Union Pacific Flyer, Butch, like what we had in mind.
You fellas got everything
I told you all wrong.
Sure, we might hit the Flyer, but even if we do, it won't be this run.
It'll be the next one, the return.
Sundance and me, we been checking the banks.
No banks.
What?
The Flyer, Butch.
Fellas, bad as they are, banks are better than trains.
They don't move.
They stay put.
You know the money's in there.
When I left,
I gave orders.
New orders been given.
I run things here,
Harvey.
Used to you did.
Me now.
This don't concern you.
You tell him to stay out.
Well, he goes his own way, like always.
What's the matter with you guys?
When I came here, you were nothing.
I formed you.
Who says?
Read them a clipping, News.
Which one?
Any of them.
This one here's from Salt Lake Herald.
"Butch Cassidy's
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang..."
That's me!
You want Harvey to do your planning?
Want him to do your thinking for you?
You want him to run things?
Shut up now, News.
Not till I get to the good part.
"Also known to have participated in the holdup are Flat Nose Curry and News Carver."
I just love to read my name in the paper, Butch.
So we just forget about Logan taking over,
OK, Flat Nose?
You always said that any one of us could challenge you.
'Cause I figured no one would do it.
Figured wrong, Butch.
You guys can't want Logan!
At least he's with us.
You been spending a lot of time gone.
Well, that's because everything's different now.
Guns or knives, Butch?
You got to plan more, prepare more.
Guns or knives?
Neither.
Pick!
I don't want to shoot with you, Harvey.
Anything you say, Butch.
Maybe there's a way to make a profit in this.
Bet on Logan.
I would, but who'd bet on you?
Sundance... when we're done and he's dead, you're welcome to stay.
I don't mean to be a sore loser, but when it's done, if I'm dead, kill him.
Love to.
No, no. Not yet.
Not until me and Harvey get the rules straightened out.
Rules in a knife fight?
No rules.
If there ain't any rules, let's get started.
Someone count
1, 2, 3, go.
1, 2, 3, go.
I was really rooting for you, Butch.
Well, thank you,
Flat Nose.
That's what sustained me in my time of trouble.
Hey, what's this about the Flyer?
Harvey said we'd hit it both this run and the return.
Nobody's done that to the Flyer before.
No matter how much we got at first, they'd figure the return was safe and load it up with money.
Harvey thought of that?
Yes, sir, he did.
I'll tell you something, fellas.
That's exactly what we're going to do.
Stop it.
Where?
Up ahead there.
Bet that's old Butch himself.
Hold it there.
Just thought I'd watch.
Bring the kids, why don't you?
Stick your heads in.
You're just going to get yourself blown up you don't open that door.
I can't do that.
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific
Railroad. He...
Shut up about that E.H. Harriman stuff and open up.
What's going on?
We got a patriot in there.
That's young Woodcock.
He's awful dedicated.
Woodcock?
Yes, sir.
You know who we are?
You're the Hole-In-The-Wall
Gang, Mr. Cassidy.
I understand that, but Mr. E.H. Harriman himself give me this job.
I got to do my best.
Your best don't include getting yourself killed.
Dynamite's ready.
Mr. E.H. Harriman himself had the confidence...
Open the door, or that's it.
You think
E.H. Harriman would get himself killed for you,
Woodcock?
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific
Railroad, and he entrusted me...
Hey, Woodcock.
Woodcock, you all right?
Hey.
Hmm?
Whatever Harriman's paying you ain't enough.
There ain't what I'd call a fortune in there, Butch.
Well, just so we come out ahead.
That's the main thing.
The Hole-In-The-Wall Gang
The Hole-In-The-Wall Gang
just robbed the Flyer right outside of our town, so that makes it our responsibility to get out there and get after them.
You'll have to bring your own horses.
How many of you can bring your own guns?
How many of you will want me to supply you with guns?
Well... come on now.
I think it's up to us to do something, don't you?
What's the point?
They're probably halfway to Hole-In-The-Wall already.
That's exactly why we have got to hurry.
If we mount up right now and get out there after them, maybe we can head them off.
If we did that, they'd kill us.
We don't want to let them get away with this.
Boy, I just eat this up with a spoon.
All right, youse two,
I want you at my party.
What party?
I'm losing my piano player.
He's going off to fight the war.
What war?
The war with the Spanish.
Remember the Maine.
Who can forget it?
I'm giving him a send-off. so come on.
When I was a kid,
I always thought
I would grow up to be a hero.
It's too late now.
Why'd you say something like that?
You didn't have to say something like that.
You want me to go alone and fight the Hole-In-The-Wall Gang?
That's fine with me.
If you want your kids to know you let me,
that's fine with me, but I don't think that's what you want.
Is it?
Why don't we enlist, go fight the Spanish?
You and me in the war.
We got a lot of things going for us... experience, maturity, leadership.
I'll bet we end up officers.
I'd be Major Parker.
Parker?
Yeah.
That's my real name.
Robert Leroy Parker.
No fooling?
No.
Mine's Longbaugh.
No fooling.
Long what?
Harry Longbaugh.
So you'd be
Major Longbaugh.
What do you say?
You just keep thinking,
Butch.
That's what you're good at.
But you're not frightened.
No, sir.
You have got respect for me,
and I have got respect for you.
That's why you and you and you are riding with me.
Am I right?
Well, what do you say?
I say this.
I say, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, friends and enemies, meet the future!
The future what?
The future mode of transportation for this weary
Western world.
Now, I'm not going to make a lot of extravagant claims.
Sure, it'll change your whole life for the better, but that's all.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You got the crowd together, so I thought I'd do a little selling.
I'm trying to raise a posse here.
A short presentation.
The horse is dead.
This item sells itself.
Are you going to listen to him or come with me?
Butch, Fanny says to come into her party right now.
No oats, no mess, no kicks, no bites,
no running away, no stepping on your foot.
Well, I think
I'll get saddled up and go looking for a woman.
Good hunting.
Shouldn't take more than a couple of days.
I'm not picky... as long as she's smart, pretty... sweet... gentle, and... tender and refined... lovely... carefree.
Aah!
Keep going, teacher lady.
It's OK Don't mind me.
Keep on going.
Let down your hair.
Shake your head.
Do you know what I wish?
That once you'd get here on time.
You are mine,
Etta Place.
Mine.
You hear me?
Mine.
All mine.
Your soft white flesh is mine.
Soft... white... bwhaa!
Meet the future.
Do you know what you're doing?
Theoretically.
Aah!
You've come to get him for the Flyer?
Would you believe
I'm broke already?
Why is there never any money, Butch?
I swear, Etta,
I don't know.
I've been working like a dog all my life, and I can't get a penny ahead.
Sundance says it's because you're a soft touch and always taking expensive vacations, buying drinks for everyone, and you're a rotten gambler.
That might have something to do with it.
Butch.
Hmm?
Do you ever wonder if I'd met you first we'd been the ones to get involved?
We are involved, Etta.
Don't you know that?
You are riding on my bicycle.
In some Arabian countries, that's the same as being married.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Stealing your woman.
Take her.
Take her.
Well, you're a romantic bastard.
I'll give you that.
OK, open up in there.
I work for
Mr. E.H. Harriman...
Hey, Woodcock!
Butch?
You OK?
Uh, well, sort of.
Hey, that's wonderful.
Let's take a look at you.
Well, now, Butch, you've got to have more respect for me than to think I'd fall for a stunt like that.
You can't want to get blown up again?
Uh, Butch, you know if it were my money, there's nobody I'd rather have steal it than you.
But I'm still in the employ of Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific
Railroad.
Start this train!
Get back inside, lady.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm a grandmother and a female, and I've got my rights.
We got no time for this.
You can bull the others, but not me.
I've fought whiskey, and I've fought gambling...
We got no time for this.
What are you doing?
Let go!
What are you going to do to her?
Well, leave her alone.
You're after the money, and the money's in here.
Please! All I want is for somebody to start this train.
Somebody, please!
Open the door,
Woodcock, or tell her goodbye.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name,
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
What am I going to tell poor Mr. Harriman?
Woodcock, what'd you have to go and do something like that for?
Well, Butch, you blew the last one so easy,
I just had to, um, do something.
Give me that and get some more, a lot more!
Well, that ought to do it.
Think you used enough dynamite there, Butch?
Ha ha ha ha.
What the hell is that?
Whatever they're selling,
I don't want it.
Will you leave it?
Come on!
Hyah!
Hey, Butch!
What?
They're very good!
Split up!
How many of 'em are following us?
All of 'em.
All of 'em?
What's the matter with those guys?
Hyah!
I think we lost 'em.
Do you think we lost 'em?
No.
Neither do I. Hyah!
Take our horses out back. Feed 'em good.
Where's Sweetface?
Just inside.
Trouble?
Listen, you dirty old man,
I know you're a lying thief and so do you, but who'd know it to look at you?
Get yourself out front fast.
You seen us ride through not five minutes ago.
Do this right,
I'll get you an old dog to kick.
Here, room 9.
Top of the stairs.
Hey, you realize you're driving me crazy staring out the window like that?
I swear, Sweetface can handle it, easy.
He wouldn't dare louse me up.
He's that scared of me.
Hey, kid, how can I give Agnes the concentration she deserves with you staring out the window like that?
Butch, you're really something, you know that?
Could you be a little more specific about that, Agnes?
Butch!
OK, Sweetface, give them a nice smile.
Come on.
That's a nice touch.
I swear, if he told me
I rode out of town
10 minutes ago,
I'd believe him.
And there they go.
No, no.
Don't ask me to stay.
You're the only real man I ever met.
You know that, Butch?
It's not just 'cause of all that money you got to spend on people. It's you.
The way you're always looking to see am I happy or not?
A lot of the other girls, they... they might want you for when you got lots of money to spend on people.
Me, I... I don't care about... clothes and money and jewels... and furs, and things like that.
Lots of the other girls do, but I never did.
I always said,
"Agnes..."
Don't move.
Stand up.
Put your hands up.
Higher.
Now turn around and start...
Get our horses and come on back here.
Hyah!
Get out of here!
Get out!
Go on!
Get out of here, you fat-headed beast!
Come on!
You're the fat-headed beast.
Quit shouting!
Boy, somebody sure trained 'em.
Which way?
Well, it doesn't matter.
I don't know where we've been, and I've just been there.
They can't follow us.
We're safe.
You really think so?
I will if you will.
How long you figure we've been watching?
Oh, a while.
How long before you figure they're not after us?
A while longer.
How come you're so talkative?
Just naturally blabby, I guess.
Ohh! I haven't done so much riding since I quit rustling.
That's a miserable occupation.
Dusk to dawn, no sleep, rotten food.
Hey.
I see it.
Torches you think?
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe lanterns.
They're following our path.
Dead on it.
I couldn't do that.
Could you do that?
How can they do that?
Who are those guys?
You sure this'll work?
It'll work.
That's what you said about Sweetface.
This'll work.
Once they divide up, we take them, no trouble, right?
Maybe.
Boy, for a gunman, you're one hell of a pessimist.
They ought to get to where we split up any time.
They're just about there.
How many of them do you think will come our way?
Oh, I wish we had rifles.
I mean, they got rifles.
But we got surprise on our side, right?
So far, they're doing what we want.
You think we ought to take them from up here?
Kid, look, you know this work better than I do.
Is it best here, or maybe down there, closer to the trail?
Uh...
Damn it!
They're not going for it.
Who are those guys?
I don't know.
I don't know.
We got to do something and shake them.
Whatever you come up with is fine with me, but whatever it is, it better be now!
What are you doing here?
Easy, Ray. Easy.
What the hell do you mean, take it easy?
You promised you'd never come into my territory.
And we haven't.
Just because we were friendly doesn't give you the right to break in.
What if we was seen together?
I'm too old to find another job.
At least have the decency to draw your guns.
Listen, Butch is trying to tell you something.
All right.
What do you want?
A couple of things.
We want to enlist, Ray.
In the army.
Right away.
Go fight the Spanish.
Oh, you're crazy.
You are crazy.
You are, both of you, crazy!
They'd throw you in jail for a thousand years each.
Come on, Sundance.
Start trussing my feet.
Here. You seen these before. Come on!
I'm not taking the chance that someone saw you coming in.
We're serious about this.
You are known outlaws.
We'd quit.
That's the point.
Is that on tight?
That's all right.
There's some hankies in the drawer you can use to gag me.
I swear, this'd work, Ray.
You trust us.
The government trusts you.
Anything you tell them they gotta believe, right?
You've never done a dishonest thing ever, and you're pushing 60.
We'd quit.
They'd drop the charges against us, we'd fight till the war is over.
They don't even have to make us officers.
That's some proposition.
They forget all about the years of thieving and robbing.
They take you into the army, which is what you want in the first place.
There's something out there that scares you, huh?
But it's too late.
You should've let yourself get killed while you had the chance.
You may be the biggest thing to hit this area, but you're still two-bit outlaws.
I never met a soul more affable than you, Butch, or faster than the Kid.
But you're still two-bit outlaws on the dodge.
It's over!
Don't you get that?
Your times is over, and you're gonna die bloody, and all you can do is choose where.
I'm sorry,
I'm getting mean in my old age.
Come on. Shut me up,
Sundance.
Ah, you're wasting your time.
They can't track us over rock.
Tell them that.
They're beginning to get on my nerves.
Who are those guys?
You remember the time you, me, and Etta went to Denver for a vacation?
I'm glad you brought that up, Kid.
That's an important topic, considering our situation.
The night we went gambling, remember?
We had dinner at the hotel.
Etta had roast beef, and I had chicken.
If I can remember what you had,
I'll die happy.
Look out there.
What?
I got to talking to some gambler that night.
He told us about an Indian... full-blooded Indian, except he used an English name,
Sir... somebody.
Lord Baltimore?
That's right, and he could track anybody over anything day or night.
So?
The guy on the ground,
I think it's him.
No. Baltimore works out of Oklahoma.
He's strictly an Oklahoma man.
I don't know where we are, but it isn't Oklahoma.
Ah, it couldn't be him.
It couldn't be him.
I guess.
Whoever it is, it sure the hell is somebody.
Damn it!
Don't they get tired?
Don't they get hungry?
They've gotta be.
Why don't they slow up?
They could even go faster.
At least that'd be a change.
They don't even break formation.
Do something!
Kid.
What?
Who's the best lawman?
Best? How?
You mean toughest or easiest to bribe?
Toughest.
Joe LeFors.
Gotta be.
LeFors never leaves
Wyoming. Never.
You know that.
He always wears a white skimmer.
That's how you tell it's Joe LeFors,
'cause he wears a white straw hat.
Look at that guy out front.
Jesus, who are those guys?
Hyah!
Come on now.
Here you go, Kid.
Go on! Get out of here!
Go on!
What if they don't follow the horse?
You're the brains,
Butch.
You'll think of something.
Damn it!
The way I figure it, we can either fight or give.
If we give, we go to jail.
I've been there already.
If we fight, they can stay where they are and starve us out... or go for position, shoot us.
Might even get a rock slide started.
What else can they do?
They could surrender to us, but I wouldn't count on that.
They're going for position, all right.
Better get ready.
Kid, the next time
I say let's go someplace like Bolivia, let's go someplace like Bolivia.
Next time.
Ready?
No. We'll jump.
Like hell we will.
No. It'll be O.K. if the water's deep enough and we don't get squished to death.
They'll never follow us.
How do you know?
Would you jump that if you didn't have to?
I have to, and I'm not gonna.
We got to.
Otherwise we're dead.
Come on.
Just one clear shot... that's all I want.
I want to fight them!
They'll kill us.
Maybe.
You want to die?
Do you?
All right,
I'll jump first.
No.
Then you jump first.
No, I said.
What's the matter?
I can't swim!
Why, you crazy?
The fall will probably kill you.
Oh-oh... ohhh... shiiiit!
Hang on to me.
You're drowning me!
I can't help it.
I can't swim.
You're choking me!
I can't swim!
I'm telling you, if I drown,
I swear to God
I'll kill you.
Never said I was a great swimmer.
Oh! You're choking me!
Oh! I'm choking!
Let go of me.
I'm choking!
Let go of my throat.
The papers said they had you.
Was it LeFors?
Did they say?
Joe LeFors?
I think so.
And their tracker?
Tracker?
Was it Lord Baltimore?
I think so.
The paper's inside.
You got enough to feed us?
Don't you know I do?
They said you were dead.
Don't make a big thing out of it.
No. Make a big thing out of it.
Hey.
It was Baltimore and LeFors.
You know who else?
Who?
Jeff Carr,
George Hiatt...
Hiatt?
T.T. Kelliher.
We lucked out getting away.
You know that?
Why would these guys join up and take after us, though?
Forget it.
Bunch like that won't stay together long.
They will... if Mr. Harriman has his way.
Who?
Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific
Railroad.
He resents the way you've been picking on him, so he's outfitted a special train and hired special employees.
You've been avoiding them for two days.
It's really sort of flattering if you want to think about it that way.
A setup like that costs more than we ever took.
Apparently he can afford it.
That crazy Harriman.
That's bad business.
How long do you think
I'd stay in operation if every job cost me money?
If he'd just pay me what he's spending to make me stop robbing him,
I'd stop robbing him.
You probably inherited every penny you got!
Inherited guys, what the hell do they know?
You say they were hired permanent?
No. Just till they kill you.
That means they're still after us, Butch, and it's going to be the same thing all over again.
They'll show up here... sooner or later.
Hey, Etta.
I'll get you some more.
Butch and me have been talking it all over.
Wherever the hell
Bolivia is, that's where we're off to.
We'll go down there and play it safe, maybe keep our hand in a little bit.
Butch speaks some Spanish.
I can wrestle with a menu O.K.
And you speak it good.
And it'd be good cover going with a woman.
No one expects it.
Then we could travel safer.
What I'm saying is, if you want to go,
I won't stop you, but the minute you start to whine or make a nuisance,
I don't care where we are,
I'm dumping you flat.
Don't sugarcoat it like that, Kid.
Tell her straight.
I'm 26, and I'm single and a schoolteacher, and that's the bottom of the pit.
And the only excitement
I've known is here with me now.
So I'll go with you, and I won't whine, and I'll sew your socks, and I'll stitch you when you're wounded, and I'll do anything you ask of me except one thing.
I won't watch you die.
I'll miss that scene, if you don't mind.
The future's all yours, you lousy bicycles.
Well, you know, it could be worse.
You get a lot more for your money in Bolivia.
I checked on it.
What could they have here that you could possibly want to buy?
Jeez, all Bolivia can't look like this.
How do you know?
This might be the garden spot of the whole country.
People may travel hundreds of miles just to get to this spot where we're standing now.
This might be the Atlantic City, New Jersey, of all Bolivia for all you know.
I know more about Bolivia than you know about
Atlantic City, New Jersey,
I can tell you that.
Aha!
You do, huh?
I was born there.
I was born in New Jersey... brought up there, so...
I didn't know that.
The total tonnage of what you don't know is enough to shatter...
We're not accomplishing as much as we might.
Listen, your job is to back me up, because you'd starve without me.
And you, your job is to shut up.
He'll feel a lot better after he's robbed a couple of banks.
Ha ha ha ha!
Bolivia.
Hell, it's just a bank like any other bank.
You got to move in slowly, check out everything.
The thing to remember...
Don't tell me how to rob a bank.
I know how to rob a bank.
A few dark clouds appear on your horizon, and you just go all to pieces, don't you?
Buenos días, señores.
¿Les puedo servir en algo?
Ordenen para atenderlos por favor inmediatamente.
¿Quieren hacer algún depósito?
¿Quieren abrir una cuenta?
Bien, el cajero los atienda inmediatamente.
Los atendemos por todo.
Señor?
Adiós.
This is a robbery.
Esto es un robo.
Esto es un robo.
This is supposed to be a unison recitation.
Why do I have to do any of this?
He's the one who claimed he knew the language.
Your line of work requires a specialized vocabulary.
I got nervous. I forgot the words. Shoot me.
You've had worse ideas lately.
Raise your hands.
Uh... las manos arriba.
Raise them.
Arriba.
All of you back against the wall.
Todos ustedes, um...
arrímense a la pared.
Give me the money.
Give me the money.
Give me the money.
This is not going to work, and we're going to be up all night until you get this.
Now give me the money.
It's on the tip of my tongue, Etta.
I swear it.
Butch, are you still thinking in there?
What the hell else is there to do?
Try this one.
Where is the safe?
Open it.
Dónde es...
Uh, that's a hard one.
¿Dónde está la caja?
¡Ábrala!
That's very good, Butch.
You're a good teacher,
Etta.
¡Esto es un robo!
Manos a...
Manos, um...
¡Manos arriba!
They got them up!
Skip down!
- ¡Arriba!
- Skip on down!
Todos ustedes arrísmense a la pared.
They're against the wall already!
Dónde es...
Oh, you're so damn smart, you read it.
A goddamn crib sheet.
You almost blew it.
You sure didn't help much.
You can't do anything without a crib sheet.
For God's sake, don't drop the money!
I won't drop the money!
Voy a traer el comisario.
Sí, vamos.
Ay, nombre.
Evarista.
¿Evarista qué?
Señor comandante,
dos hombres acometen y asaltan el banco.
Dos yanquis y una muchacha
se fueron por la cañada.
Se llevaron mi pistola y todo el dinero.
Vámanos!
A caballos!
Isn't that a pretty sight?
Well, we're back in business, boys and girls, just like the old days.
Let's stay here and get him and be done with it.
But what if we lose?
We saw him with two guys.
What if he's got 20?
You don't know for sure it's LeFors.
I'm a hell of a guesser.
He can't arrest you.
It's a foreign country.
He can't take you back.
He's not going to take anybody back.
He's going to wait for us to pull another job and then hunt us down.
Let's finish it now,
Butch, one way or the other.
He's got to wait for us to pull another job.
Well, what if there isn't another job?
He can't arrest us, and he can't take us out of here.
We'll drive him crazy.
We'll outlast the bastard.
We'll go straight.
So you want jobs.
You're from the U.S. of A., and you are seeking after employment.
Well, you couldn't have picked a more out of the way place in all of Bolivia,
I'll tell you that.
Gracias, Jesús.
Ordinarily you've got to wait to work for
Percy Garrison, but this ain't ordinarily.
Bingo.
You mean there are jobs.
Yes, there are jobs.
There are lots of jobs.
Don't you want to know why?
Yeah, why?
Damn it.
Because I cannot promise to pay you.
Don't you want to know why?
OK, why?
On account of the payroll thieves, fellow citizens.
You see, every mine around gets its payroll from La Paz.
And every mine around gets its payroll held up.
Some say it's the
Bolivian Bandits, and some say
that it's the bandidos yanquis.
Could I see that?
Mm-hmm.
Fairly nice-looking piece.
Can you hit anything?
Sometimes.
Hit that.
No, no, son.
No, son.
I just want to know, can you shoot your piece?
Shoot.
Damn it.
Can I move?
Move?
What the hell you mean, move?
I'm better when I move.
Yeah.
Well, considering that I'm desperate and you're just what
I'm looking for, on top of which you stem from the U.S. of A., we start tomorrow morning.
You mean we got jobs.
Payroll guard.
Damn.
Vámanos a trabajar!
Hey, Chucho!
Chucho!
I think they're in the trees up ahead.
In the bushes on the left.
They're in the trees up ahead.
You take the trees,
I'll take the bushes.
Will you two beginners cut it out?
Well, we're just trying to spot an ambush.
Morons.
I've got morons on my team.
Nobody is going to rob us going down the mountain.
We have got no money going down the mountain.
When we have got the money on the way back, then you can sweat.
Bingo.
Move it out!
Move it!
We hit this place in June, didn't we?
Jones!
Give me a hand over here.
Who am I,
Smith or Jones?
Live.
About a half hour more, and we can start to worry... as soon as we get to that pass up there.
We'll be all right till then.
They might try something here.
No. Better cover up there.
You got to relax, you fellas.
You got to get used to Bolivian ways.
You got to go easy.
Damn it!
Like I do.
Of course, you probably think I'm crazy, but I'm not.
Bingo.
I'm colorful.
That's what happens when you live 10 years alone in Bolivia.
You get colorful.
Where are they?
I can't see them.
Let's get out of here.
Tell them to leave the money and go.
Dijen el dinoro...
Dinero... and, uh...
y váyanese.
¿Que dejemos el dinero y nos vayamos?
Tell them we were hired to take it back.
It's our job.
Tell them the money isn't ours.
El dinero...
no es nuestro.
No, ya no es de ustedes.
Ahora es de nosotros.
Claro.
We'll try telling them again.
It's our job.
The money isn't ours.
El dinero no es nuestro.
Lo necesitamos.
También nosotros necesitamos.
What do you think?
Not so good.
Can you take the two on the right?
Kid, there's something
I think I ought to tell you.
I never shot anybody before.
One hell of a time to tell me.
Try for the two on the right dead center.
That way, if you miss a little, you'll still hit something.
Go.
Please.
¿Qué?
Por favor.
¿Por favor?
Aah!
Well, we've gone straight.
What'll we try now?
There are other ways of going straight, you know.
There are other ways of going straight.
There's farming.
We could buy a place.
I don't know how to farm.
What about a ranch, then?
I don't know.
The last time we tried ranching was during our rustling days.
Even then, we weren't much good at it.
It's hard.
Hours are brutal.
No, you got to be a kid to start a ranch.
Hey.
Hmm?
I might go back ahead of you.
You mean home?
I was thinking of it.
Whatever you want, Etta.
Maybe I'll go.
Hey.
Hmm?
Etta's thinking of, uh, maybe going home ahead of us.
Whatever she wants.
I'll go, then.
¡Manos arriba!
How much you got?
It's hardly worth it.
Alpoca mine.
I tell you, no more jungle work for me.
You're getting to be an old maid.
Keep your old maid remarks to yourself.
I'll work in the city, in the mountains, but from now on jungle work is out.
¿Bandidos yanquis?
Mm-hmm.
Tell them to be quiet.
What's the word?
Quietas.
Quietas.
I tell you, the jungle's a better cover for payrolls.
Kid, I got a right to my opinion, and in my opinion, there are snakes in the jungle.
I don't work around snakes.
What is this place?
I don't know.
San Vincente,
I think.
¿Comer?
Si, Señor.
Pasen.
Juan, ven.
Llévate los caballos.
I don't enjoy jungles.
I don't enjoy swamps.
I don't like snakes.
I don't much care for night work.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
¡Capitán! ¡Capitán!
Capitán, allá en la plaza,
hay una mula de las minas de Alpoca.
¿Las minas de Alpoca?
Sí, sí. Allí están.
Dos hombres la acaban de traer.
Están comiendo en el restaurante de mi papá.
El guisado está delicioso.
Para chuparse los dedos.
Si quieren mas, es la especialidad de la casa,
si quieren mas,
no tengan pena y díganmelo.
Yo estoy aquí para servirles.
Agradezco la visita de tan distinguidos caballeros.
Muchas gracias.
Para servirles.
Muchas gracias.
Sí.
The specialty of the house, and it's still moving.
Well, that settles it.
This place gets no more of my business.
Hey.
What?
What do you think?
I bet it's just one guy.
Don't you get sick of being right all the time?
Reloading.
That's all I got.
We're going to run out unless we can get to that mule and get some more.
I'll go.
This is no time for bravery.
I'll let you.
Loaded.
Hell!
I'm the one that has to go.
Why you?
'Cause I could never give you cover.
You can cover me.
You can see I'm right, can't you?
You go.
Yeah, why am I always so damn smart?
Here.
Go.
O.K.
Go.
Ah!
Is... Is that what you call giving cover?
Is that what you call running?
If I knew you were going to stroll...
You never could shoot, not from the very beginning.
And you are all mouth.
Jefe, llega el ejército.
Mi capitán.
¿Dónde están?
Allí en la plaza.
¿Cuántos hombres son?
Dos hombres.
¿Dos hombres?
Mi capitán, por favor...
¿Dos?
Bandidos yanquis.
¿Bandidos yanquis, eh?
Sí, mi capitán.
Hmm.
Sargento Rico,
desmonten 20 hombres
y vayan con el teniente.
I've got a great idea where we should go next.
I don't want to hear it.
You'll change your mind.
Shut up!
OK, O.K.
Your ideas got us here.
Forget it!
I never want to hear another of your ideas.
All right.
O.K.
Australia.
I figured secretly you wanted to know, so I told you.
Australia.
That's your great idea?
Oh, boy, it's the latest in... in a long line.
Australia's no better than here.
Aw, that's all you know.
Name me one thing.
They speak English in Australia.
They do?
That's right, smart guy.
So we wouldn't be foreigners.
They got horses in Australia.
They got thousands of miles we could hide out in.
And a good climate, nice beaches.
You could learn to swim.
No!
Swimming isn't important.
What about the banks?
They're easy.
Easy, ripe, and luscious.
The banks or the women?
Well, once you've got one, you've got the other.
It's a long way, isn't it?
Aw! Everything's got to be perfect with you.
I don't want to get there and find out it stinks.
At least think about it.
All right.
I'll think about it.
Hey.
When we get outside... and we get to the horses, just remember one thing.
Hey, wait a minute.
What?
You didn't see LeFors out there, did you?
LeFors?
No.
Oh, good.
For a moment there,
I thought we were in trouble.
¡Fuego!
¡Fuego!
¡Fuego!
