# I dream of not a ray of sun 
# A moment 
# And then the empty dawn 
# Awakens the lonely heart broken 
# A warm embrace 
# A fleeting smile 
# A whisper 
# And then the dream has gone 
# With most of the words left unspoken 
# Each lonely day when I awaken 
# I could not face the empty dawn 
# For I know 
# That my heart has been forsaken 
# A dream of love was all I knew 
# That moment before the empty dawn 
# Awakened my lonely heart broken... # 
DOOR CREAKS 
Tequila. 
- Is he having a dance? 
- Five-ace card player. 
STRUGGLES FOR BREATH 
Five dollars he doesn't last another minute. 
- Cut him down. 
- You stay out of this, Yank. We'll cut him down when he quits kicking. 
Ugh! 
Billy... Get in, boy! 
LAUGHTER 
GUNSHOT 
LAUGHTER CONTINUES 
Where have you been, Billy? 
GUNSHOTS 
- You'd better ride with us. 
- There ain't no Yellowleg Yankee boy goin' with us! 
I hear they got a new bank and an old marshal over at Gila City. 
- That beats cheatin' at cards, don't it?
- Let's go. 
The town looks quiet. 
Yeah, I bet the marshal's asleep. 
Ever shoot a man in his sleep, Yellowlegs? You bein' a Yankee? 
He ain't very sociable, is he? Been with us a week and ain't lost his temper once. 
- I never did trust a man who didn't lose his temper. Let's go. 
- We ain't takin' the bank today. 
- Are you givin' the orders now? 
- Looks that way, don't it? 
- Billy, get him in the back. 
- No, Turkey, that ain't my style. 
Come on, he's askin' for it, boy. 
Any man that'd turn his back on you is just a dag blam fool. 
I kinda like him. 
I never knowed a Yankee before. 
PLAYS MOURNFUL TUNE 
Hey, Mead! THEY CHANT TAUNTINGLY 
CONTINUES PLAYING TUNE 
CHILDREN LAUGHING 
Your horse needs a shoe. 
There's a blacksmith's shop. 
- How long do you figure that money's gonna keep?
- Till I tell you when. 
- I'm kinda anxious to get my hands on it.
- Take care of your horse first. 
I was figurin' on havin' a couple of drinks with you fellas. 
I sure hope this town has some pretty girls in it. 
When you get this far out in the brush, they're all pretty. 
Billy, take the horses round to the livery stables. 
Uh... 
Are you talkin' to me? 
Your name's Billy, ain't it? 
I'll take the horses for you, mister. 
Well, you look like an honest man. 
You know, some folks is just born lucky, I guess. 
Doggone it, you know, don't push yours! 
What's going on here? 
These don't look too pretty to me. 
I told you, you ain't been out here long enough. 
Hey! 
Hey, hey, wait a minute. Put that thing back up. 
- That'll have to wait, gents. 
- Wait? Wait for what? 
Church is about to start. The parson don't like to look at it during his sermon. 
- This ain't Sunday, is it?
- That's a matter of opinion in Gila City. 
We haven't seen a calendar in two years. Some folks hold it's Monday, but these folks hold it's Sunday. 
- Are you gents lookin' for a drink? 
- I'm lookin' right at it. What's in that bottle? 
- Best we've got. Even the Mayor drinks it.
- That'll have to do. 
- Tell me somethin'. How about the bank?
- The bank's open. They're Monday folks. 
The bar's closed when the parson walks in. 
Howdy, mister! 
Hello, boy. 
Hey, that's what I call pretty. 
- Who's she, the redhead?
- Works over at the dance hall across the street. 
Imagine comin' in here like she was respectable and bringin' her woods colt with her! 
- Imagine!
- She wouldn't know his father if she saw him again. 
- Poor boy.
- I imagine it's as close as she ever was to a parson. 
And her holding a prayer book like she was respectable! 
If they're going to heaven, let's you and me not go! 
Gents, the bar is closed. 
Number 23. 
# Rock of ages, cleft for me 
# Let me hide myself in thee 
# Let the water and the blood 
# From thy wounded side which flowed 
# Be of sin the double cure 
# Save from wrath and make me pure 
# Could my tears forever flow 
# Could my zeal no languor know 
# All for sin could not atone... # 
- What are y'all drinkin'? 
- No drinkin'. The bar's closed on account of the church meeting. 
- Whisky. - I told them the bar's... 
Billy, show 'em those six-shooters! 
See how fast you can take the cork out of that bottle. 
I wanna tell you somethin'. He's fast with them six-shooters. This boy's a real comin' boy. 
I taught him everythin' I know. 
- What's the matter?
- You'll have to stand and look at that bottle all the way through the sermon. 
# Let me hide myself in thee... # 
Lord, I see you sent us some new faces today. 
Male... and female. 
Lord, I thank you, and folks, I welcome you. 
And I'll be dishin' out the gospels in a minute. 
But first, I've got to say a word to you gents with your hats on. 
This here is a preach-house, gents, and you'll take your hats off to the Lord. 
Mister, I never met a man who wouldn't take off his hat to the Lord. 
Let's get it off. 
You get on with your preachin'. 
- He's touchy about that hat. 
- I've never seen nothin' like it. He don't even take it off to sleep. 
We'll have a moment of silent prayer. 
Yes... 
All that money just sittin' out there across the street. 
I've never known a man so hungry for money. I think you're studyin' up to be a miser. 
Studyin' up to buy us an army. Don't you remember? 
- Still dreamin' about that? 
- It ain't such a dream. 
We could set up our own republic on this country. It's wide open. Nobody can stop us. 
Take that bank money and the Comancheros will sell us 100, maybe 200 slave Indians. 
We put uniforms on 'em. 
Yeah, fix us up an army. 
And I could drill 'em. 
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hooray, hooray 
# When Johnny comes marching home again... # 
Left face, right face... 
# Johnny comes marching... # 
Mm-hm. 
Raise this arm. 
Raise it. Higher. 
Mm-hm. All right. 
- Has it always pained you that way? 
- Almost always. 
That ball ought to come out of there. 
That's what I'm here for. 
- Have you ever been in Springfield, Ohio?
- No. 
I'll swear I've seen you someplace before. 
Here... 
How long will this lay me up? 
- It's pretty close to the collarbone. A thing like that won't heal overnight, you know.
- What, a week? 
More like a month. 
Well, I got a little business to attend to. 
I don't think it can wait that long. 
Then stop wasting my time. 
Wait a minute. 
Missoura. That's where it was. 
A fella just about your size, Yellowleg sergeant. 
Somebody had tried to scalp him. A liquored-up Johnny Reb with a Bowie knife. 
He cut the sergeant up pretty badly before he was scared off by something. 
You know, if you take off your hat, you could make me out a liar. 
It's you, all right. 
You certainly went out of your way to look me up, didn't you? Take off the hat. 
I've kind of got used to keeping it on. 
Why? You haven't got anything to hide but a few battle scars. A lot of the boys came out with worse than that. 
- What did you do after the war ended? 
- What would YOU do? 
- I'd go after that Reb. 
- Well, I found him. 
Is that Reb in town? 
Well, what are you waiting for? 
I'm waiting to get him alone. 
You see, I want him to know who I am. 
I want him to know he's gonna get what he gave me. 
Are you sure you found the right man? 
Yeah, I'm sure. I left my teeth marks in his scalping hand. 
And I'm askin' you, my friends... 
Any man, woman or child that reckons that he wants to go to hell, 
I say let that man, woman or child stand up and be counted! 
What? 
Start countin', Parson. Get up, Turk. 
You white-livered coyote, you're saying you intend to go to that place? 
I sure do, Parson. I'll tell you somethin' else. 
Any man that don't get on his feet right now and join me is goin' there pronto! 
GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMING 
Well, nice to meet you, ma'am. My name's Billy. Billy Keplinger. 
Get out! 
GASPS AND SCREAMS 
Come on, Turkey! 
Sure is a pretty girl. 
Ma'am, I want to thank you for your fortitude. 
We'll all close with a prayer now for those poor, misguided men. 
All that money just sittin' there, waitin' on a Yellowlegged Yankee. 
I never saw a man so patient about robbin' a bank! 
Oh, church meeting's over. 
You have a nice afternoon. 
Thank you again, ma'am. 
STARTS PLAYING MOURNFUL TUNE 
Let me know when that Yankee's patience runs out. 
If his patience ever does wear out. 
That pretty redhead that just went in holds that today is Sunday. 
What do you lovely creatures feel about that? 
I think it's Monday. 
- Get your horse.
- Huh? 
Get it. 
Billy! 
Hey, Billy! Yellowleg's ready. 
GUNSHOTS 
SHOUTING AND GUNSHOTS 
Somethin' wrong with that Yankee's shootin' arm. 
Somebody get the doc. 
He's dead. 
It was them outlaws, Kit. They did some wild shootin'. 
No. 
It was me. 
- 'Is she the dance hall woman? 
- That's her. 
'Imagine comin' in here like she was respectable, bringin' her woods colt with her! 
- 'Imagine!
- She wouldn't know his father if she saw him again. 
- 'Poor boy.
- I imagine it's as close as she ever was to a parson. 
'And her holding the prayer book like she was respectable!' 
That Yellowleg sure has been tryin' to get hisself drunk. 
He ain't quite makin' it though. 
Some men are like that. Give me two. 
The boy's leanin' awful hard on him. 
You reckon the Mayor will be able to talk that redhead into changin' her mind? 
Ain't nothin' gonna change her mind. 
She got Doc Acton to take care of the body and rented herself a wagon. She's goin' tonight. 
Goin' alone if she has to. 
We've come to change your mind, Kit. 
We've decided to have a nice funeral for the boy in Gila City. 
The whole town will come. As Mayor, I'll see to it. 
Mead will be buried in Siringo next to his father. 
Now, Kit... 
Bury him here? You think I haven't heard all the whispering? 
- You and your gossiping little wives with their pinched little faces and their noses in the air!
- Miss Kit... 
"That dance hall woman with her freckle-faced woods colt. 
"No telling who the father might be!" 
They smell brimstone every time I walk by. 
They hated us both, me and the boy. 
Well, he's dead now and you can tell your wives that there was no sinning and there'll be no funeral. 
I'm taking him to Siringo. 
You can't do that. It's smack in the middle of Apache country and there ain't nobody willing to go with you. 
Besides, there's not much of it left but the weeds. 
I've tried, Kit. I've asked everybody. 
I'm not asking anybody to go with me. 
Poor Kit. She's trying mighty hard to make folk believe about the boy's pa. 
- Are you a single man?
- Married. 
- I didn't know that, Cal. 
Well, almost married. 
Me and Emma. She wouldn't let me go with Kit. Not that way. 
Not to mention the Apaches. 
I ain't never seen a town so full of cowards. 
I ain't never seen a town so scared of Indians. 
TURK CHUCKLES 
You can take three. 
Kit? 
I hate to think what all that sun will do to your face. 
Will you take this? 
No, thanks, Cal. 
Take it. I've got no use for it. I can't sell it. 
Imported all the way from St Louis. 
Get down from there! 
I said get down! 
- Somebody's got to drive this for you.
- Not you. 
I'm askin' to. 
I said get down! 
Need any help, ma'am? 
- Get out of here, Billy. 
- I didn't mean to butt in... 
Your place. 
Get down. 
I bet she don't get 20 miles before she turns around. 
50 dollars. 
And a call. 
What have you got? 
You lose to four aces. 
- We're leaving town.
- You're a little premature, Yellowleg. 
Get your horses. 
Billy and me like this town. We're stickin' around. You'd better leave alone cos we ain't leavin'. 
It wasn't me that shot that boy. 
Get up. Get up! 
Looks like you and me is gonna go to Siringo. 
Billy, you and I ain't leavin' here. 
I'm just backin' him up. 
Yeah, I kinda like the idea of going to Siringo with that redhead. 
Come on. What's the matter? 
Come on! 
I guess you don't mind the Yellowleg orderin' you around, but I don't like it. 
But if I could handle that six-shooter like you, Billy boy... 
His back's pointin' right at ya. What's the matter? Scared? 
Scared he might hear your gun comin' out of the holster? 
That ain't no fit way to kill a man. 
Not even a Yankee. 
There she is. 
Yah! Yah! 
- Good morning, ma'am.
- You'll kill your horse pushin' him like that. 
- Will you let me drive that wagon for you?
- I don't want YOUR help! 
Well, I'd be mighty proud to ride in that wagon with you, ma'am. 
Leave me alone! 
Both of you. 
Well, now, you know it ain't exactly safe out here for a woman? 
Well, it ain't exactly safe for you either. 
Any of you. Now git! 
Why don't you leave this woman be and let's head back? 
Yaah! 
Listen, that bank is probably just now opening up. 
Yeah, it probably is, probably is. 
We'll follow along and see she gets through. 
Turkey, that's a woman! 
Come on, let's go. 
Your dress is kinda wet. I guess you're gonna have to dry it out. 
It shouldn't take long in this heat. 
I never did see a dance-hall girl so touchy about gettin' kissed. 
You stay away from me. 
What will you do with that rock? Use it on me? 
Or a shotgun if I have to! 
Well, ma'am, I always did go for high stakes. 
Apaches. 
They scalped him. 
Yeah. It looks like they did. 
Come on, let's get back to that wagon. 
Hey, the coffee's ready! 
It's plain to see that woman don't want us round here, so why don't we accommodate her by leaving? 
Did you desert? 
- Hmm? 
- Did you desert the Rebel Army? 
I don't remember telling you I was in the army. 
I figured you for a deserter. 
How did you guess? 
Maybe I ought to take her a cup of coffee before it gets cold. 
Leave her alone. 
Are you... Are you talkin' to me? 
Hey, Billy, I think Yellowleg's kinda taken a shine to that woman. 
- And we thought he was feelin' sorry about that boy.
- Shut up! 
- Touchy too.
- Yeah. 
Like he is about that hat he keeps wearin'. 
- You know what I think he's got under it?
- What's that? 
Money. 
Well, there's one way we could find out. 
We can ask him... 
Take your hat off, Yellowlegs. 
He's scared of you, Billy. 
Yellowlegs... 
Take your hat off or I'll shoot it off. 
You try it and I'll kill you. 
BILLY LAUGHS 
Yellowlegs, there's something about you I just gotta like. 
Better mind your thinkin', kid. Yellowleg has done got his claim staked out. 
We could go back to that bank. That posse would never follow us out here, not to Siringo. 
We could set up our own little republic like that Edward fella did down in Texas. 
You know, the republic of Freedonia? 
All this land out here, just a-waitin'. Think how you'd look in a gold braid uniform! 
You're the kind of trigger-happy young fella I can use. 
I'd make you my military aide. 
Then we'd start makin' up a lot of laws, but not one of them would apply to us. 
- They don't now. They never did. 
- There's money in a thing like this. 
If it's run right. But we've got to start first with that bank back in Gila City. 
Turkey, don't you ever shut up? You nag like an old woman! 
It's sure quiet out here, isn't it? 
I don't blame you for feelin' the way you do, but right now, it might be a good idea if you could make out like we were getting along. 
Are you always that stubborn or just hard to figure out? 
Lady... 
I'm just tryin' to help. 
Who are you trying to help? 
Riding shotgun on this wagon isn't going to buy you a clean conscience! 
I'm beginning to wonder if you ever figured on going to Siringo at all. 
What are you trying to say? 
I mean, right here is as good as Siringo for the boy. 
You don't have to prove anything to me. 
Damn you! 
- Look at 'em fightin'!
- Yeah. 
You don't know me well enough to hate me that much. 
Hating is a subject I know a little something about. 
You've got to be careful it don't bite you back. 
I know somebody who spent five years looking for a man he hated. 
Hating and wanting revenge was all that kept him alive. 
He spent all them years tracking that other man down, and when he caught up with him, it was the worst day in his life. 
He'd get his revenge all right, but then he'd lose the one thing he had to live for. 
GUNSHOT 
- What was that for? 
- I was just checking my aim. 
Nothing like letting the Apaches know where we are! 
That ain't no fit way to kill a man, not even a Yankee. 
You go on up ahead and find us a place to camp. 
- There might be some Apaches out there.
- Then you go find out. 
You know, you could get the sun here. 
I'll get used to it. 
We'll be leaving you in Siringo. You can find your own way back. 
DISTANT HOWLS 
Come on. 
Turk, what are you doin' out here? This ain't your guard. 
I want to show you somethin'. 
I've been carryin' this around with me for a long while. 
- What's that? 
- It's a genuine general's cap. 
I stole it over at San Antonio. I never did show it to anybody before. 
A man sure really looks like something wearin' one of these, don't he, boy? 
Huh? 
If you're waitin' for me to salute you, you're gonna wait a long time. 
Here, I want to show you something else. 
Here... Come here. 
See that part right there? 
It's not on a regular map. A valley. Not many people know it's there. 
We're gonna buy ourselves some slave Indians. We're gonna put uniforms on and we're gonna fill 'em good. 
We'll be able to burn a fire path through this country from Tucson to Tucumcari. 
What do you say, boy? Huh? 
What do you say to that, huh? 
Fine, Turk, fine. 
Um... 
Take over my guard for me, will you? 
I never travelled with a lady before. 
It kinda appeals to me. 
- Get out of my way. 
- Maybe I will and maybe I won't. 
I'm telling you to leave me alone. 
I don't wanna... I don't wanna trouble you, Kit. 
I just wanna be sociable. 
And I never wear my guns when I make a social call. 
I always did like pretty things and... 
You're just about the prettiest I've ever seen. 
HE LAUGHS 
Saddle up. 
Come on, get out of here. 
- I'm goin' with you, Billy. 
- You ain't goin' no place.
- Huh? 
- You're stayin' right here. 
- He wouldn't stand a chance in Apache country alone.
- That's his lookout. 
COYOTE HOWLS 
Turk! 
He's gone. 
- They'll be going back to Gila City, both of them. I'll drive you back if you want.
- No, thanks. 
You still going to Siringo? 
- You think you can stop me? 
- Lady, I wouldn't even try. 
Aaaiee! 
I, uh... 
I'm sorry about losing the horse. 
- Well, you don't have to talk to me, you know!
- It ain't worth the effort. 
Five years is a long time to turn your back on, especially for a woman like me. That's what you think. 
- Lady, I quit thinking when I turned my horse around.
- Stop calling me Lady! My name is Kit. 
- I don't know you well enough! 
- Don't think you're fooling me. 
You're not half as mad at me as you are at yourself. 
Gonna talk all the way to Siringo? 
Ha! 
GUNFIRE AND WAR CRIES 
Grab that shotgun! Come on! 
GUNFIRE CONTINUES 
Must have ambushed that stage down at the border. 
YELLING AND WHOOPING 
I sure wish I could take a bath. 
Well, nothing's stopping you. 
Come on. 
Want some more? 
You know...I can hardly remember what my husband looked like. 
We were only married a few weeks. We were on our way to Gila City when he was... 
..he was killed in Siringo. 
When Mead was born, they wouldn't believe me. 
Gila City put a brand on both of us. 
With their...jokes and their...talk and their ugly little smiles. 
Getting dark. 
We've got to have another horse. 
Them Apaches can't be far off. They've got plenty of horses. 
You wait right here until I get back. 
SHOUTS AND CONFUSION 
CONTINUES FIRING 
Whoa. 
Kit! 
Pack up. We're moving out. 
Whoa. 
That's far enough. 
I don't think I can stay awake another minute. 
You'll have to. 
Start digging. 
- What?! 
- We're going to bury the wagon. 
Our trail's got to look Indian. If we're lucky, those Apaches are still trying to find their stagecoach. 
Getting tired? 
I didn't ask for any help. 
I wasn't offering any. I just asked if you were getting tired. 
Is Yellowleg a name? 
Well, it'll do. 
- Where are you from?
- Ohio. 
Is it pretty back there? 
Used to be. 
What are you doing? 
Do and I'll kill you. 
What is it? 
Apache. 
- How could he miss?
- He didn't. 
Well, why didn't he kill us? 
He's got a little score to settle up with me first. 
Start packing up. 
- Can't forgive me for making you give up those five years, can you? 
- I'll pick up his trail again. 
Hardly seemed worth the trouble. 
HORSE STIRS 
There you go. 
RATTLESNAKE HISSES 
He broke it. 
SINGLE SHOT 
What is he waiting for? Why doesn't he kill us? 
He will when he's ready. 
- Why don't you kill us and get it over with?! Come on!
- Stop it! 
- Leave me alone!
- Shut up!
- Why do you let him torture us?
- Shut up! 
Our Apache friend's been awful quiet. Maybe he got bit by a snake. 
- Do you think it's much further? 
- What?
- Siringo. 
- Siringo what?
- Do you think...? 
Strange. 
I feel I know you better than any man I've ever known. 
Yet I hardly know you at all. 
- What are you trying to do? 
- You're hurting me! 
- What did you expect to find? 
I was only trying to make you more comfortable. 
I'm sorry. 
HORSE WHINNIES 
Sorry... 
There's...some things about me you don't understand. 
You killed the only person I loved in this whole world. 
That's all I need to know about YOU. 
Next time I'll be waiting for him. 
Inside. 
Go on. 
This'll do. 
Here. 
You've got enough buckshot in there to stop an army. 
He ought to be on top of the bluff by sundown, so I'll wait for him. 
If I'm not back by morning, you're on your own. 
Wait. 
I...just wanted to say... 
..thank you. 
RUMBLE OF THUNDER 
THUNDER GROWS LOUDER 
- Aaaiee!
- Ungh! 
Aaargh! 
Where is it? By the mission? 
What was your husband's name? 
Mead Tildon. My son was named after him. 
I couldn't find it. 
It's there. 
No, there ain't nobody named Tildon buried there. 
You're just the same as all the rest of them. 
Here it is. 
It must be one of the others. 
Kit! 
Kit! I found it! 
I found it. 
Yellowleg. 
- Where's Turk? 
- Right behind you. 
When Billy gets hold of an idea, he just won't let go of it. Especially a red-headed woman. 
Well, there's no need to keep the lady out here in the sunshine. 
Let's step inside and talk things over. 
Sorry I can't offer you folks a drink. 
- What did you do with the money? 
- Money? What money? 
- Only one thing would bring him down here - keeping ahead of a posse.
- I never saw folks so scared of Injuns. 
I tell you, she sure is pretty. 
Turkey, go get that money. 
- Are you crazy?
- Go on. Do what I told you to do. 
- You know, I...I just ain't got the heart to kill him.
- Huh? 
How would you like to have your gun back? 
- You want me to do it? 
- I'll be much obliged. 
- Just the minute he walks back through this door.
- What about her? 
We'll decide that later. You and me. 
Well, I'm going for a little walk. I'll be around. 
The lady's got to admit I got guts. 
You'd better get out of here. 
- You can't! 
- I've waited five years. The waiting is over. Now keep out of it. 
What happened to Mead was an accident. I know that now, even though I thought that I could never forgive you for it. 
But I could never love a man who was a cold-blooded killer. 
Love? 
You don't even know me. 
I'm a face under a hat. 
Ever wonder why I won't take this off? 
- Want to talk about love? 
- I've seen you with your hat off. 
What about MY scars? 
Do you know how many men I've let kiss me just because their filthy money gave them the right? 
Men with dirty shirts, smelly arms, money in their pockets. 
Can those scars be forgotten? 
Can I ask you to love a... 
..a woman like that? 
Now don't that make a pretty picture? 
Where's Billy? 
- Out of the way.
- Don't do it! 
All this shooting and he ain't even touched him yet. 
Turkey... 
Billy! Are you crazy?! 
All right, Yellowleg. This is it. 
- You and me.
- Move out, Billy. Move out. I ain't got time for you. 
There ain't but two horses in this town. You know only two people are gonna ride out of here alive. 
You turned on me, Billy. And I raised him from a puppy. 
I'm not giving him this money. 
No... 
Get me some slave Indians... I'll train them myself. 
Take all this money... 
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH 
Yellowleg, Yellowleg, listen to me. We can make ourselves a deal. 
I don't want that Billy with me. I want you! Look at you. I put you in that uniform. 
Now come on, listen to reason. 
Why can't a Yankee join up with a Rebel? 
We could do it together. Look at all this money here. Look. I'll give it all to you. 
I'll make a general out of you. General Yellowleg. Think of how you'd look in one of these caps... 
Listen, Yellowleg, like I told you up there... 
- You're gonna be in my army. I'll make a general out of you with gold braid.
- Remember that? 
You know where you left it, don't you? 
- Chickamauga.
- Look at it. 
- No... Oh, Yellowleg, listen to me, I don't want that Billy...
- Look at me! 
Yellowleg, I'll make a general out of you. You'll look good in that gold braid. Listen to me... 
- Oh...
- Don't! 
Get out of here! 
Don't do it! 
Aah! 
(TURK) Billy! 
Billy! 
You tell Yellowleg it's a fact I got soldiers! 
HORSES APPROACH 
Hi. We're trailing a couple of bank robbers. You got one of them. 
- Where's the other?
- Inside. Looks like they figured you didn't have guts enough to come here. 
- You know how people are. If it's their money, the gates of hell wouldn't stop them.
- Sure. 
Parson, we're going to need a few of the right kind of words from you. 
- We're burying a boy alongside of his dad.
- I'll say the right words. 
- This is a convoy.
- Yes, sir. 
- Gentlemen, you're going to make great officers in my army. 
I'll soon have your uniforms for you. Gold braid. And then we'll start training... 
Thank you, sir. Well, Captain, if you'll say, "Forward, yo!" to these ranks, we'll go. 
Forward, yo! 
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah 
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah... # 
Fill up those ranks! 
Forward march! Follow me, men! 
We'll get us an army, we know what to do. 
We buy some slave Indians... 
# Each day when I awaken 
# No more I face the empty dawn 
# For I know that my heart is not forsaken 
# The dream of love that once I knew 
# Now lingers beyond the empty dawn 
# No more is my lonely heart broken... #
Ever since man started to think, he's wanted to fly.
But flying was strictly for the birds... and continued to be so for thousands of years.
Man, eternally optimistic, kept trying.
Encouraged by his many successes, man kept trying.
Through his genius and his inventiveness, he managed to get his machines off the ground, and sometimes he brought them down again.
Bravo! Bravo!
All over the world, early pioneers were making flying history.
And in Italy,
Count Emilio Ponticelli... made what many people claimed was the first long-distance flight.
There was no doubt about it, by 1910, flying had become the rage.
Man had conquered the air, and people everywhere were all agog about... those magnificent men in their flying machines.

Hello, Richard!
Oh, Richard! Oh, Richard, please take me up.
Oh, no, not today.
No, it's much too windy.
Come on.
We'll swing her round.
And anyway, strictly speaking,
I'm still on duty. Lift!
It isn't too windy for you to fly.
Come on.
Give a hand.
Oh, Richard, look at that bird.
It can go wherever it likes, whenever it likes.
- You're so lucky.
- Yes, I know.
Oh, I'd like to soar through the air and look down on the world.
Right, let her down.
I think I'd make a very nice bird.
Yes, I daresay.
Thank you, Carter.
Richard, isn't the rigging a bit tight?
It seems to be stretching the fabric.
You're getting rather good at noticing things.
Well, I should jolly well hope so.
Thank you, Carter.
After all the work I've done on this contraption.
Uh, Patricia, did you get a chance to talk to your father about my idea?
Yes, he's very interested, but you'll still have to talk to him.
Oh, well, I can do that, all right.
Tell him it will increase the circulation of his newspaper.
Wave the flag. You know,
Britannia rules the sea, but she doesn't rule the sky, and all that sort of thing.
Yes, I know exactly what to say.
Good. Then, when he's agreed to your idea, you're to ask him if you can take me flying.
Hmm. Yes, I might.
This afternoon?
- All right.
- Oh!
Patricia, not now.
I'm in uniform.
Oh, Richard, don't be so silly.
Follow me in your motorcar.
I'll try not to go too fast.
Oh.
- What's the trouble?
- Oh, nothing.
- Father doesn't know about this.
- Oh.
Won't be a minute.
- Well?
- Very nice.
You look just like a girl.
Thank you.
You know, one of these days, your father's going to find you out.
Mmm, I know.
Exciting, isn't it?
The trouble with aviation today is that too many good ideas.. . are being dissipated in too many aeroplanes.
If we could bring together all these different types from all over the world, then everyone could learn from each other.
From all over the world?
If possible, Lord Rawnsley. The French and the Americans are well ahead of us.
- I never knew that.
- Well, it's our own fault.
Believe it or not, no Englishman flew until three years ago.
Really?
Britannia may rule the waves, sir, but she doesn't rule the skies, not yet anyway.
Have some more Madeira.
Oh, you haven't finished.
Damn it.
We should rule the sky.
I can see you're going to be a real enthusiast, sir.
Anytime you should care to come up-
No, thank you, Mays.
I may be an old fogy, but I think that if the Lord had intended me to fly, he would have given me... wings.
You travel by train, Father, but you haven't any wheels.
Do you really mean no Englishman flew until three years ago?
That's right, sir.
Hmm.
Come and see me again in a few days.
Meanwhile, I'll discuss your idea with my circulation people.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
Uh, by the by, sir, there's one other thing.
I wonder if I might take
Patricia up this afternoon.
Up? Where?
Oh, into the sky,
Father, flying.
Certainly not! I absolutely forbid you to go up, and I absolutely forbid you... to take my daughter flying, today or any other day.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.
Absolutely, sir.
Thank you, sir.
"I absolutely forbid you to take my daughter flying, today or any day.
- Patricia, darling-
- Is that absolutely understood?"
"Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir." Three bags full, sir!
It's not my fault. Now, Patricia, you can't blame your father... for thinking that flying is dangerous. It is.
But when he gets enthusiastic about the idea, he'll change his mind.
Now, you'll see.
Oh, Patricia.
No, Richard.
You're in uniform.
If you won't take me flying,
I shall find someone who will.
Oh, all right.
I suppose you wouldn't like to go have lunch at Windsor.
You could drive the car if you like.
- Me?
- Yes.
Oh! Come on.
Well, that's my idea, gentlemen.
Not a festival but something which will fire the imagination of the world, which will bring together all the different types of flying machines... and, at the same time, increase the circulation of my newspaper.
An air race, gentlemen, initiated, sponsored and rewarded by the Daily Post.
An air race which will show that
Britannia not only rules the waves... but intends, in future, to rule the skies.
An air race between the two most important capitals of the world-
London and Paris.
But that means flying across the English Channel.
Well, of course it does.
That's the whole idea, Gascoyne.
Well, the French fellow did it last year.
I presume some progress has been made since then.
- Of course there has, sir.
- Very well.
I shall leave the details to be worked out by my staff.. . and you gentlemen of the Royal Aero Club.
You, Gascoyne, will be my liaison officer, an aeronautical correspondent.
I shall expect you to go aloft as often as possible.
Yes, sir. Um, may one ask what the prize will be, sir?
Most generous, sir.
That should attract fliers from all over the world.
That's the idea.
Nevertheless,
I shall expect the prize to be won by an Englishman.
"Great London-Paris air race.
"Daily Post offers £10,000 prize.
Competitors will actually fly across
English Channel." That's not bad, eh?
Could you add, um, "Foreign newspapers, please copy"?
That's already done there at the bottom of the page.
- Here are some more invitations.
- Good.
You know, between these invitations and the newspapers, we should reach every flying man in the world.
Emilio Ponticelli-
Italy.
Pierre Dubois
- Dieppe, France. France. Right.
Mademoiselle, s'il vous plaît.
Monsieur Dubois!
Monsieur Dubois!
Monsieur Dubois!
Monsieur Dubois!
- Mon Dieu!
- Dear me.
Il est mort!
Oh, am I dead, or am I dreaming?
Ah, merveilleuse.
You are so charming.
- What's your name?
- Brigitte.
Brigitte?
Oh, formidable.
Concussion.
Sir.
Monsieur, perhaps it is important.
It's from England.
Nom de chien!
250,000 francs?
- You?
- We must get down the machine.
- Yeah, What, me?
- Yes, you. Quick!
Read it, please.
"His Imperial Majesty the Kaiser commands.. .
"that a German officer wins the- the London-Paris air race.
You will make arrangements accordingly."
- Rumpelstrosse.
- Herr Colonel?
Order another flying machine.
Jawohl, Herr Colonel, another flying machine.
But there's no one else who can fly.
It cannot be difficult, otherwise Winkler couldn't have done it.
- Not that he was any good at it.
- Of course, Herr Colonel.
- So, Rumpelstrosse.
- Herr Colonel?
You will fly the new machine.
Jawohl, Herr Colonel.
But how will I learn to fly?
Same way as we learn everything else in the German army- from the book of instructions.
Come on!
I don't mind your being interested in the ladies. That's natural.
But it ain't natural to stand up and wave to 'em when you fly past them.
I lost my head, George.
Yeah. You lost most of my investment too.
I told you I could fix it.
Maybe we better just call it a day, Orvil.
Go back to work like ordinary people.
George, you just don't have the flying bug.
You don't fly, so you don't know what it's like up there.
It ain't the going up that discourages me.
It's the different ways you keep finding of coming down.
Boy, when you're up there, you get a sense of freedom and power that- well, that you just don't get from anything else.
No, sirree. I'm never gonna give up flying.
Hey, Orvil, look at this.
"London to Paris air race.
First prize- $50,000."
- Whoo-ee!
- "For further details, turn to page six."
Whoa!
Somewhere out there is page six.
Where is the great Ponticelli?
Ah! There he is!
There he is over there.
Emilio!
Emilio, have you heard the news?
Papa.
Emilio, now you give up flying, huh?
I promise, cara.
No more flying.
Finito Ohh!
Emilio, are you all right?
Every bone in my body is broken.
Emilio, have you seen this?
- Sophia?
- Eh?
Look.
I shall enter.
I shall win... for Italia.
- But you promised.
- Is postponed.
Come, we go and make-a the plans.
I'll buy the best-a flying machine in the world.
Like-a Caesar, we go to England!
Bella, Bambini, andiamo!
Bravo!
Bravo! Emilio! Emilio! Italia!
Yamamoto!
Just imagine, do you know we've had 83 entries?
Forty from the continent alone.
Ha! Interest in the race is worldwide.
I really think it's one of the best ideas I ever had.
Shh!
Your go, Patricia.
Another entry, from Phoenix-
- Arizona, milord.
- Arizona.
Arizona?
Oh.
Well, for someone to come all that way, must be either very rich or very confident.
Well, as he's American, he's probably both.
I say, there you are!
You didn't invite that bounder Sir Percy, did you?
No, of course not. Then, what the devil's he doing here?
I don't know.
- Hello, Miss Rawnsley.
- Hello.
Rawnsley, Mays. Just popped in for an entrance form.. . for that little junket of yours to Gay Paree.
If you are referring to an official entry form.. . for my London to Paris air race, my office will send you one.
Well, considering the fact that I'm one of England's foremost aeroplanists, it's rather jolly inefficient of them not to send me one before.
I say, excuse me, if you'll hold your mallet like this, you'll play that shot much better.
I shall hold my mallet as I've always held my mallet.
In that case, you'll miss the shot.
What did I tell you?
Missed the shot.
Well, I expect we'll be seeing you again soon, Sir Percy.
- Mm-hmm. - Glad you're going to join the race.
I'm not only going to join it, dear boy. I'm going to win it.
Do you really think you have a chance, Sir Percy?
Miss Rawnsley,
I never leave anything to chance.
Hang on to the tail.
I'm revving up. Hang on.
Hey, Orvil, look at that.
Wow! So this is
Brookley, huh?
- That's what you gotta beat.
- Yeah.
- Whoo-ee!
- Oh!
Hey, you take over.
I'll be right back.
- You all right?
- Yes, of course.
Oh, dear.
Thank you. No, no, the other way. This way.
- No, it's the other way.
- Ohh!
- Oh, look what you've done.
- What I've done?
Oh! Haven't you ever seen legs before?
Well, sure I have, lots of times, particularly when you take girls flying as often as I do, you get to see lots of legs.
And bloomers too.
Oh, but none of them as pretty as yours.
If that's supposed to be a compliment, I'm not flattered.
Did you say you took girls flying?
Well, sure I do, all the time, only back home.
I'm strictly here to race.
- Oh, you're one of the Americans.
- Uh-huh.
Oh, well, that explains everything.
- My bicycle, please.
- Oh, sure.
Say, uh, do you work around here?
No. Why?
Well, I thought that, uh-
Well, I'd like to see more of you.
You could have worded that better.
I'm afraid it's impossible.
I'm not being stuffy, but we haven't been introduced.
Well, do we have to be?
But of course. English girls don't care to be picked up.
So, until we are properly introduced, good-bye.
Ah, there you are, Mays.
- Oh, hello, sir.
- I'm glad you're in. I want to have a word with you.
Oh, certainly, sir.
Inside or out?
Out.
Well, I expect you know what
I want to talk to you about.
Oh, yes, sir, the race, of course.
No, no, not the race-
Patricia.
She's getting rather keen on you.
Oh.
Well, are you intending to propose to her?
Well, with your permission, sir.
My dear fellow, you can take that for granted.
Your father was at school with me.
There's just one snag, sir.
Oh?
It's finding the time for married life. What do you mean?
Well, I'm soldiering all day, and
I'm rather busy in the evenings too.
Monday I dine in.
Tuesday's card night at White's.
Wednesday I play snook with the adjutant.
Thursday, uh, well, we like to end up at Romano's.
Uh, that only leaves Friday.
Yes, but what about the weekends?
Well, that's flying, sir.
It's the only time I've got.
But I could give up my card night if you like, sir.
Oh, I don't think that's necessary.
We don't want to spoil the girl.
You do love her, don't you?
- Oh, I do, sir, very much.
- I thought you did.
Well, glad to have had this little talk. Nice to know you're serious.
So few young people are these days.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, sir.
Well, over there are the hangars.
When you get delivery of your plane, you will put it in the one nearest us.
First-a class for a first-a class plane. Wait till you see it.
Oh, my darling, it's-a wonderful.
I'm going to be very happy here.
And I'm very happy for you too.
What is all that water?
Actually, it's the sewage farm. What is sewage?
Actually, it's rather nasty, really. Drains and all that.
Jolly useful. Most of the pilots crash over there sometimes-
- Crash?
- They don't consider themselves aeroplaners until they have.
- Oh, oh.
- Well, now, uh, you'll want to know all about the practice times.
You are scheduled for 7:30 in the morning.. . and 4:00 in the afternoon.
Ah, first-a class. You'll be following the French.
I no follow any Frenchman. Italy come-a first or no come at all.
We go! Finito. Andiam' a casa. Andiamo.
Sir! Sir!
I say, sir! Sir!
Sir, if you feel so strongly about it, sir, you can go before the French.
I can?
- First-a class.
- Okay, steady on.
Sophia, we go before the French.
- Who is this?
- It's Lord Rawnsley.
Ah. This is the English milord.
Good morning, milord!
Good heavens. He's brought his entire family.
Who is he?
Emilio Ponticelli.
Richard says he's not only a great pilot, he's one of the richest chaps in Italy.
Never stops buying flying machines.
A great enthusiast for everything.
- Morning, milord.
- Morning, sir!
Righto, lads.
Heave-ho, onto the field.
Achtung!
Brigitte!
Oh, wonderful!
Every time I see you, my heart sings.
Brigitte, no. Ingrid.
I am Swedish.
- Swedish?
- Ja.
- But didn't I see you in Normandy?
- It's possible.
Come. Come and teach me to fly.
Oh!
Oh!
Look, Father! He's teaching her to fly!
How ridiculous. Anyone can see that young woman.. . isn't in the least mechanically minded.
- Good heavens, what's that?
- Does 35 miles an hour!
Wingspan of 30 feet!
Now, when you get up to about 40 flaps a minute, use the top power and you're away!
You are sure it will fly?
Of course it'll fly! What do you think it's gonna do, lay an egg?
This has the power of an eagle, the- the grace of a swan.
- And it's a bargain for 350 guineas.
- Emilio!
Don't-a worry. It's-a going to be first-a class!
Put it on for me, please!
No, I don't want that.
Is guaranteed.
Emilio, put it on for me, please!
Ah, Sophia.
Eh.
All right!
Take it away!
Up! Up! Up!
Up! Up!
Oh, God.
Oh, well, we all make mistakes.
Easy with her.
- Watch the tail skid, Charlie.
- Right.
Morning, sir.
Morning, madam.
Morning, Sir Percy.
I hope your hands are clean.
Come on, Courtney!
- Switch is off, sir?
- Switch is off, Courtney.
- Switch is on, sir?
- Switch is on, Courtney.
Contact, sir?
Contact, Courtney.
Come on, Courtney, you lazy loafer!
Hang on! I haven't revved up yet! Useless lot!
You! Yes, you!
Go and stand over there!
Give my chaps a hand, will you?
He's not supposed to carry passengers.
Ooh, heck.
Stand by, lads!
It's Sir Percy!
Make for the sewage farm!
Uhh! Oh!
Buzz off!
What the hell are you doing?
Whoo, that's my toe! Get your backside out of my face!
What the hell are you doing down there?
I can't land the plane!
Back to the sewage farm!
- He's gonna crash!
- Yeah.
You bounder! Look what you've done to my aeroplane!
I'll kill you!
Aaah!
- Come on, Courtney! Get on!
- Ooh!
Achtung! Halt!
Is this where the
Yankee fellow hangs out?
Yes, governor, this is the place.
Are you quite certain he's smaller than me?
- Oh, yes, governor.
- Right.
Stay there.
Hey, you there,
Yankee chap.
Oh, howdy.
- Did you want me?
- I certainly do.
You caused me to crash my flying machine.
I therefore intend giving you a jolly good thrashing.
- Ready?
- Ready.
I suppose you think that's funny.
- Well, pardon me.
- Eh?
You might wanna thrash someone else with this.
Yes.
Got a cold, governor?
♪ Ooh-ooh ♪
You're late.
Ooh, Richard. Ooh, you taste of castor oil.
Ew.
Did you fix the extra petrol tank?
Yes.
And changed the oil.
Did need changing.
You were quite right.
Of course.
I'm always right.
And now you're going to help me grease the undercarriage.
- Whoops!
- Now, come on.
Right. You begin greasing here.
On the axle?
Mmm, it could do with it.
Say, you've really got yourself something here, don't you?
- Anything I can do for you?
- Well, I was, uh-
I was hoping that you might let me borrow a monkey wrench from you.
Monkey wrench?
Oh. Well, I can let you have an adjustable spanner if that's what you mean.
Well, I guess that's what they call it in England.
- You're Orvil Newton, aren't you?
- That's right.
- I'm Richard Mays.
- Howdy-do.
I'll get it for you.
Oh. May I present
Miss Patricia Rawnsley?
Well, howdy-do.
Now, wouldn't you say this constitutes a formal introduction?
Well, y-yes,
I suppose so.
Do you have to do that every time we meet?
Oh, please.
Well, I-
Go on.
Hurry up!
Thank you!
Your monkey wrench,
Mr. Newton.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'll bring it back just as soon as I'm through with it.
Where'd you meet that fellow?
Oh, I-
I met him here.
Oh. Good-looking chap, isn't he?
Is he?
Oh, I-I didn't notice.
Come on, Richard.
On with the greasing.
Oh, thanks, dear.
Here. Just a wee dram to warm me up a bit, eh?
Oh!
Ingrid!
You are working here.
My name is Marlene.
I'm German.
But I've met you somewhere before, I'm sure.
- Oh, it is possible.
- Oh, never mind. We have met now.
And I would like you to know I adore Germans.
Howdy.
May I sit down?
Let me make quite sure my skirt is out of the way first.
How is the food?
Everything's off but the chop and chips.
Oh. Well, uh, well, that's what I'll have then.
Can I order you anything?
Oh, no
- no, thank you. I'm just going.
Not bad, huh?
Oh. Oh, yes. It's a very beautiful aeroplane.
- No, I meant me.
- Oh!
- Oh, is that you? Oh.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, I don't normally carry my photograph around.
It's just that, uh, well, Mr.
Gascoyne of the Daily Post, well, he wanted it, you see.
Oh, uh, please begin.
That's a Wright biplane, isn't it?
- No, that's a Curtis.
- Oh.
Is that the one you take passengers up in?
Mm-hmm. It's got an Anzani engine in it, developing 70 horsepower.
And you brought it all the way from Arizona?
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you must be very rich.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, ma'am, but we came all the way across by cattle boat.
We're in hock way up to our eyebrows.
Now, if I don't win that race, I'm going to lose my plane and everything.
Say, do you know that you are very beautiful?
Oh, yes,
I know I am.
I also have a very good figure, I'm rich... and I'm in love with an extremely handsome man.
- Mmm.
- Is he in love with you?
- Well, I think so.
- Well, hasn't he told you?
Well, no.
No, not exactly.
I mean, yes.
Yes, he has.
- Hmm.
- Well, let's talk about you.
All right. What do you want to know about me?
Would you take me up?
Well, sure. Anytime.
Tomorrow?
All right. First thing in the morning, huh?
Say, um, you have flown before, haven't you?
Yes. Yes.
Hundreds of times.
Well, I-
I just love it. I-
Oh, I have to go now.
Until tomorrow then.
I'll be looking forward to seeing you outside my hangar.
Yes.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I've brought the car to the door.
Been sitting with that
American, have you?
Yes. He was telling me all about Arizona.
Oh, you were quite right,
Richard.
H is very good-looking.
Well, I didn't fancy the way he was looking at you.
Richard, I do believe you're jealous.
Me, jealous? I've never been jealous in my life.
If I catch him looking at you again like that,
I'll give him a good hiding.
Oh, don't be so pompous.
Who's first off this morning,
Courtney?
Mr. Dubois, sir.
Oh, he's one of the dangers.
I know, sir. He's got a better flying machine than you have.
I don't admit that.
But if he has, it'll have to be nobbled.
You're not going-
You're not going to sabotage it, governor?
I certainly am not.
You are.
Get back. Get back.
Bonne chance, Pierre!
Okay!
Bon voyage, Pierre!
I think the Frenchy's taking off.
- Shall I call the lads out?
- No.
It's a lovely day. He'll be all right. He knows what he's doing.
You all right, Chief?
Halt!
Today we fly,
Herr Rumpelstrosse.
You will taxi across the field, take off, fly one circle and return.
Understood, Herr Colonel. Taxi across the field, take off, fly one
- Aaah!
Oh! Aaah!
Ach, Schweinehund!
Take up your flying machine at once... and show those French idiots what a German officer can do!
Jawohl,
Herr Colonel.
On the double!
Eins, zwei, drei!
Rumpelstrosse!
Come back!
Herr Rumpelstrosse!
Rumpelstrosse, you fool!
Stop playing the games!
Aaah!
How can I stop this damn thing?
Get out of the way!
I can't stop!
Oh, go away!
Idiotic instructions!
Stop in the name of the- Oh!
Come back here!
Hey! Just a minute!
Here! Here, what-
Go faster!
Put your foot down!
Leave my fire engine alone!
- Hey! No!
- Look out!
Where's that flying machine from?
Somebody do something!
Hrr Rumpelstrosse, no!
Not again! Aaah!
Hey, Orvil, where you going?
Orvil, you're supposed to be practicing!
Follow that flying machine!
Hrr Colonel, what shall I do now?
- Look in the book, fool!
- I already did so!
- What's he trying to do?
- Stop it, I suppose.
Oh, isn't he brave?
Oh, well done!
Whoops!
Oh!
We're heading for the wall!
Come on!
We gotta jump off!
Stop! Stop!
Stop the plane!
He's stopped him! Hear!
Three cheers for the American!
Hey, Orvil, have you gone crazy?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Somebody had to.
You're supposed to be flying!
Hey, put that man down!
You hear me?
Bravo, Orvil!
Well done!
It's another German!
Can't stop!
Rumpelstrosse!
Herr Colonel!
Come back!
Rumpelstrosse, save me!
Rumpelstrosse!
Rumpelstrosse!
Hang on! Hang on!
Hey, Orvil, what you doing? What's that contraption you're sticking on there?
It's a scoop. Produces more pressure up in the engine.
Yeah, well it might blow up the engine. Ever think of that?
- You ever think that cigar might too?
- Mmm. Ah.
No, I need the speed. All these monoplanes around here... are a lot faster than this old buzzard.
Since we've been here,
I been looking around,
- getting some new ideas.
- Yeah.
Um, may I come in?
Oh. Well, how do you do?
Boy, you sure are pretty.
I, uh- I waited as long as I could this morning.
Oh, I wanted to apologize, but I just couldn't get away.
- Why not?
- My father insisted on coming down... to watch everyone practice.
What's he got to do  with it?
- He's Lord Rawnsley.
- Lord who?
- Oh! Didn't you know?
- No.
But this is his race.
Ha! Well, I guess he's got every right in the world to watch it then, huh?
Oh, I get it.
Well, he won't allow you to- to fly, will he?
Hmm. What'd you ask me to take you up for then?
You want me kicked out of the race?
Why didn't you ask that fellow you're supposed to be in love with to take you up?
Oh, I couldn't. He gave my father his word that he wouldn't.
Richard's a man of principle.
Oh, yeah?
I asked you to take me flying.. . because I like you.
Oh?
I like you very much.
And I'm dying to fly!
Well, I have to go now.
Just a second. Look,
I'm going all out to win.
Now, do you think
I have a chance?
Well, that's entirely up to you.
Isn't it?
Well, yeah.
I guess it is.
I'll see you tomorrow at Dover.
Those are the rules, gentlemen.
Now for the route.
First day, first leg-
London to Dover.
Emergency landing fields here, here and here.
First aid stations here, here and here.
Refueling points here and here.
What is all this fuss about?
Why do we have to go to Dover by road? Why can't we fly?
Good heavens! You can't expect these machines to fly 62 miles nonstop!
You've got to reconnoiter by road.
None of you foreigners know which railway lines to follow anyway!
On my left, landmark number seven.
The level crossing five miles west of Tunbridge.
Mark it on your maps, gentlemen, and follow the railway line to Dover.
It's a hell of a long way to the other side.
- Yeah. What do you think?
- I don't know. What do you think?
Can you swim?
Look!
You can see France.
Yes, but there's an awful lot of water in-between.
It is impossible to cross,
Herr Colonel.
Nothing is impossible for the fatherland.
Aren't you afraid of getting "drownded," governor?
Sorry to disappoint you,
Courtney.
If anybody's going to get his feet wet, it isn't going to be me.
Uh, I say.
Pardon.
Uh, pardon moi, monsieur.
Uh. est-ce qu'il. uh, um, landing field-
Calais- Oh.
What's going-
Oh, I say! Oh, boy!
They're all enjoying themselves, sir.
I should hope so.
It's costing enough.
Hey, waiter.
Thank you.
Mr. Newton!
Orvil!
- Wanna drink to my health?
- What, the seawater?
No, I mean champagne.
That was a very charming gesture.
It is most strange.
I have been to every seaside resort all over the continent, but never have I seen a German dive.
Perhaps their skulls are too thin.
Come, Rumpelstrosse.
We are going to dive.
Come in, Colonel.
The water is magnificent.
- You don't like our little joke, Colonel?
- Schweinehund!
- Uh, Newton, may I have a word with you?
- Why, sure.
- What's on your mind?
- I think I should mention... that if you continue to make advances to my fiancée, I shall knock your block off.
Champagne?
Well, she's not. uh, officially engaged to you.
It's an understood thing between Lord Rawnsley and myself.
But Patricia hasn't agreed, and until she does, well, I'll make all the advances I want.
You really are being most tiresome.
What are you doing?
Are you two fighting over me?
Oh, good!
I say! I say! The
Japanese chap has arrived!
It's Yamamoto!
You know he's flown all the way from Japan?
- Really?
- Yes.
- We don't have the facts yet, sir.
- Don't argue with me.
We must get to the landing field and welcome him.
Come along, everyone!
Lieutenant Parsons,
Royal Navy.
How do you do?
How do you do, sir?
- Mr. Richard Mays, Coldstream Guards.
- Excuse me.
Yamamoto, excuse me, sir.
First-a class-a flying machine.
Thank you.
- May I?
- Of course.
Now that the Japanese are here, nobody's going to stand a chance.
He's right. This'll be the one to beat, governor.
In that case, we'll have to nobble the man and not the machine.
Perhaps a little cascara in his chop suey.
Shut up.
Excuse me, sir. May I have a word with you?
You must've had a remarkable journey.
Ten thousand miles, wasn't it? Did you fly it all?
Of course. First I came by mule train to Yokohama, then by ship to Vladivostok.. . to catch the Trans-Siberian Express.
Good heavens!
From Moscow, overland to Paris, then to Dieppe, where I took the cross-channel ferry to Folkestone.
Quite a remarkable journey.
But at Folkestone I boarded my machine and flew all the way here!
Four miles!
Amazing.
- Orvil.
- Oh, hello.
I've been looking all over for you. Well, here I am.
- Listen, I've got an idea.
- Yeah?
While everyone's still here, you know what we could do?
I know what we could do and I know what I'd like to do, but do you think we dare do it?
Motorcycles go very much
If we left now, we could be back at Brookley before everyone else.
- And then?
- Then... you could take me up in your flying machine.
Oh. You're really determined to get me into trouble, now, aren't you?
Don't you think I'm worth it?
All right. Come on.
Bonjour, mon capitan.
Oh. Colonel.
The name of your second, please.
My second?
Who wishes to be my second?
Oh, Jean Pascal.
Colonel Baron
Manfred Von Holstein... demands satisfaction before the race.
- I suggest at dawn tomorrow.
- Anything you wish.
But you are not serious?
This is 1910, you know?
I'm aware of the date.
Tell the idiot I agree.
He agrees.
The choice of weapons is yours.
Do you wish to use pistols, sabers or rapiers?
Balloons.
- Balloons?
- And blunderbusses.
You are trying to make the fools of us again.
On the contrary. There is an historical precedent.
- N'est-ce pas?
- Mm-hmm.
A similar duel between a Frenchman and German took place in, uh-
- Is right.
The Frenchman won.
In that case, I accept.
Come along, everybody.
Let's get back to the motors.
I expect you'll be flying back.
Come along, Richard!
Where's Patricia? I thought she was with you, sir.
Well, of course she is-
What the devil is my daughter doing in that contraption? Going back to Brookley, I think.
You don't think she's persuaded him to take her up?
I absolutely forbid it. Stop him!
Stop him at once! Absolutely useless.
Faster. Richard.
Faster!
I'm doing nearly 40 miles an hour as it is, sir.
Come down at once!
I absolutely forbid it!
Marvelous!
- It's fun, isn't it?
- Yes!
Oh, look, look!
Look, there's Father.
Let's give him a fright.
Oh, rats!
I broke a wing strut.
You take over the stick and keep it steady, will ya?
Oh, no.
I- I- I can't.
Okay.
I said keep it steady!
Orvil, help!
Orvil!
I can't keep it straight!
Orvil! Help me!
I can't do it. Hurry!
- Did that girl fly the machine herself?
- Yes!
- Are you all right, Patricia?
- Of course I'm all right.
- How dare you take my daughter up!
- He isn't to blame!
This race was organized to help flying, not for brainless boneheaded nincompoops to give joyrides.
I tell you, Father, it was my fault.
It didn't occur to you, I suppose, that if you'd crashed with a woman onboard, you would have put flying back 20 years.
- You might've killed her.
- Now, look,
I knew exactly what I was doing.
And I know what I'm doing.
Oh, Richard!
Patricia, come with me.
Yes, Father.
Niven, I'll have that machine scratched from the race.
- Certainly, sir.
- Oh, not now, Not in front of everyone.
- I am entirely to blame.
- I know that.
This is the last time you'll go up flying... and this is the last time you'll ride a motorcycle.
Yes, Father.
And that includes... the one you have hidden in the garden.
- But-
- Get into the motor!
Oh!
She's at it again- disobeying my instructions.
I don't think so.
It's the American.
The American? What's he doing prowling around in my garden?
- You suppose he has a gun?
- Why should he, sir?
Well, the fellow's from the Wild West, isn't he?
- It's only a motorbicycle, sir.
- Oh.
He's trying to get back into the race, just as I've been telling you for some time.
Well, he's not going to.
He may have changed your mind.
Nothing is going to make me change mine. Nothing!
Well, go and tell him so!
Well, don't stand there!
- Anyone thinks you're afraid of the fellow!
- Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, Newton. but Lord
Rawnsley's quite adamant.
Not only are you out of the race, but he expects you to remove yourself... and your flying machine from
Brookley as soon as possible.
Are you sure you told him that I had to see him?
Look, if I don't get back in that race, I'm gonna lose everything.
Boy, we don't even have enough money to get back to London, much less Phoenix, Arizona.
You should have thought of that before.
Let's face it, old chap.
H only has one daughter.
Yes, but-
Aw, shucks!
Well, I wanna thank you for trying to help me.
- What are you going to do?
- Oh, I don't know.
I guess I'll have to sell my flying machine.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But at least you're in the right place to do that.
Well, good-bye, and the best of luck to you.
- You know your way out.
- Thanks for everything.
Orvil, I'm-
I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, well.
You were worth it.
Winning the race meant a great deal to you, didn't it?
Mm-hmm.
If I'd have won it,
I'd have been somebody.
I might've been able to go up to any girl, even a rich and a beautiful one, and say to her what I wanted to say, ask her what I wanted to ask.
Only it can't happen now.
Oh, pl-please forgive me.
I've been very, very selfish.
I'll never forget you,
Patricia.
- Good-bye.
- Oh, no! No. Wait.
I'm going to talk to Father.
It won't be easy, but I'm going to get you back into the race.
Well, uh-
He'll soon change his mind.. . when he hears what the American ambassador's got to say about this.
Well, does he know the American ambassador?
No.
Neither do I.
But Father doesn't know that.
Achtung!
No one knows better than you gentlemen of the international press that-
I guess a lot of innovations have been introduced by the various competitors.
Oh, yes, indeed!
I- Well, uh, take young Parsons of the
Royal Navy, for instance- the fellow alighting now.
He's got a marvelous new naval idea for stopping his flying machine. Look.
Uh, what's that?
It's a flying machine,
I think.
Yes, it must be a flying machine.
It's got, um, propellers.
- Any other questions?
- That's one out.
You guarantee this one will fly better than the last?
There was nothing wrong with my ornithopter, just rotten piloting, if you ask me!
You'll like this one.
Just start the engine, and you're off, all right?
Contact!
Hmm? Oh!
Gentlemen, prepare your weapons!
Gentlemen, I count 10... and then you will fire!
One, two, three, four, five, six. seven, eight, nine- Nein!
Get back to your position.
Monsieur Dubois!
Schweinehund, you are not following the rules!
- We always follow the rules!
- No! You didn't!
The French always follow the rules!
Vive la France!
This time I'll count to five!
One, two, three, four, five!
Fire!
Sabotage! Sabotage!
You idiot!
Ooh la! Ooh la!
Ooh la! Ooh la!
Ooh la la!
Ooh.
Colonel!
Rumpelstrosse!
Hello.
"With only 16 hours to go.. .
"before the start of the greatest race of all time,
"temperatures have reached boiling point here at Brookley.
"Not surprising perhaps,
"when so many different nationalities are involved.
"You will be glad to know that the slight technical difficulty...
"which it was thought would keep
Orvil Newton out of the race...
"has now been ironed out.
"Tonight, along with the other competitors,
"he is attending a small eve-of-the-race reception,
"a gathering which one hopes may foster the spirit... of peace and goodwill amongst the aeronautists."
That's the idea. It won't take a minute.
If you could just turn round too, sir.
Could we just get your photograph?
Sir, if you turn this way-
Yes. Hand-to-hand, hands across the sea. That's the idea.
Now, if you could just give us a big smile.
That's the idea.
Now, hold it.
I always thought that the English were noted... for their sense of fair play.
- Oh, we are, indeed. Yes.
- I'm ready, gentlemen.
Well, you punched me when I wasn't looking.
My dear fellow, if you continue to pursue a certain party,
I shall take the greatest pleasure in punching you when you are looking.
Well, you're gonna have your hands full, because I'm gonna marry that certain party.
I'm afraid that's going to be rather awkward, because I'm going to marry her also.
Gentlemen, could we have a nice smile, please?
Thank you so much.
Oh! I beg your pardon.
Ooh! Buzz off.
Hello! Care for a glass of wine?
No, thanks, old chap. I only drink whiskey and water.
Oh. Sir Percy. Very kind. Is that mine?
Thank you very much.
Ahhh. Serves him right, the greedy blighter.
Come, Courtney. We've got work to do. We can't do nothing tonight.
There's guards all over the place.
Besides, everybody's going to sleep by their planes.
Not everybody.
Yamamoto's still inside, and, uh. I've given the Frenchman... the address of a very lovely young lady.
Oh-ho-ho. I'll bet she's a bit of all right, governor.
Well, you should know.
She's your daughter.
But, governor, she's an innocent young girl.
Not is, Courtney- was.
Come on.
Now, drop me at the American's hangar, then pop into Yamamoto's and see what you can do with this.
What are you gonna do to the Yankee?
It's no business of yours, Courtney, but if you really want to know,
I'm going to arrange that one of his wheels falls off.
That's a bit dirty, isn't it, governor?
If he can't land on one wheel, he shouldn't be in the race.
Yeah, but he might kill himself.
There are plenty more Americans where he comes from.
Now, sir, just one without your cap.
Certainly not.
I'm a naval officer.
Oh, well. perhaps a bit of a smile, sir?
Oh, very well.
Just a bit of a one.
Lieutenant Parsons, where have you been? Everybody's been waiting for you.
You've not got your logbook filled in or your starter's forms or anything.
- Meet Nelson, my passenger.
- You can't take that with you.
- Why not?
- It'll muck up my starter's forms.
And for another, no one has yet taken an animal aloft.
Nelson doesn't go, neither do I.
Absolutely out of the question.
- Go on.
- Oh, very well then, fill these forms.
Well, that's everybody- all 14 of you.
Oh, no, it isn't. Where are those blasted Germans?
Over at the hangars, old man. I don't think they know anything about your starter's forms.
Rumpelstrosse, the great moment has arrived. Come.
Herr Colonel, it is no good.
I'm a sick fellow.
I cannot fly.
You must fly!
For the emperor and the fatherland!
For the emp-
Excuse me.
It's going to be a busy day for our lads.
All spectators away from the flying machines!
Spectators away from the flying machines, please!
- Ought to be starting them, sir.
- Nonsense.
I haven't wished the competitors good luck yet.
What's the Japanese for "good luck"?
I have it here, sir.
One moment.
Here we are.
Thank you, sir.
Good luck.
Get out of it!
- Aren't you sitting the wrong way round?
- Of course I'm not.
You take me for an idiot?
This is my latest invention.
It's an idea
I had in the bath.. . when sitting with my back to the taps.
You see, the wind resistance on the tail... is less than it would be on the wings.
Heh. I shall most likely be in Paris... before any of this lot have even got to Calais.
It's pathetic, isn't it?
- I don't know what he's talking about.
- Neither does he, sir.
Well, let's see, now.. . what was the French for "give us the money"?
Ah, bonne chance,
Monsieur Dubois.
Ah, merci, monsieur.
Mmm. Mmm.
Wrong frog, sir.
Bonne chance,
Monsieur Dubois.
Ah. Bonjour, mademoiselle.
Really, Monsieur Dubois!
Uh, forgive me, mademoiselle.
I was carried away.
The spirit of the occasion, sir. The entente cordiale.
If you ask me, too much entente and far too cordiale.
The trouble with these international affairs is that they attract foreigners.
Achtung!
Ja!
But I thought Captain Rumpelstrosse was your pilot, Herr Colonel.
I am taking his place.
H is indisposed, sir.
I didn't know you could fly.
Oh, there's nothing a German officer cannot do.
So, "'Number One. Sit down."
Ah, so-
Surely, you're not taking your family with you, are you?
You always make-a the joke.
They come to wish their papa good-bye.
No, no. Sophia, no. No, no, no, no, no. Sophia.
I see you have another new flying machine.
Presented to me personally... by his majesty the King of Italy.
Generale Parlonni.
Fsst. Fsst.
Well, good luck to you and the King of Italy.
Thank you, milord.
Thank you, milord.
No, no, Sophia.
Sophia, no, no, no.
- Can you tell me where you come from?
- Phoenix, Arizona.
Good luck.
If it wasn't for my daughter's persuasiveness.. . and my native sporting instinct, you'd be out of this race.
Fortunately, I am a very reasonable man.
Good luck to you.
At least if he breaks his neck, my daughter won't be with him.
- Good luck, Orvil.
- Oh, thank you, Patricia.
Say, will I get to see you in Paris?
There's something I want to talk to you about
- something very important.
Oh, yes,
I'll be there.
Mm. We're going over on
Father's private yacht.
Richard.
Oh. Well-
Oh.
I'm not going to wish you luck, my boy.
- I expect you to win without it.
- Well, I'll do my best, sir.
Thank you.
Well, good luck, me dear fellow. Thank you, sir.
Good luck, Richard.
Uh, well, thanks. And thanks for all your help too.
Listen, Patricia, as soon as I get to Paris, I've got to talk to you.
It's very important.
You'll be there, won't you?
Yes, I'll be there.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
There they are,
Courtney.
- I've done everything you said, sir.
- Good.
Right, now get down to Dover and carry out the rest of your master's instructions.
Oh, can't I just wait and see the nip take off?
All right.
Don't think you're gonna get treats like this all the time, Courtney.
I say, the wind's getting up a bit, sir.
- We're 20 minutes late as it is.
- We've just got to start.
I can't start without Lord Rawnsley.
Well, can you start it quickly when he does arrive?
Of course. I've only got to do this to start it.
Look. They're off!
I didn't tell them they could start.
A knife!
Get me a knife.
You ain't going to commit hari-kari?
Of course not, you bloody fool.
I've got to cut my way out, haven't I?
All right, Courtney, shoot off.
You've had your treat.
- Yeah-
- Well, go on!
Away you go!
- Mama! Mama, he's up!
- Yes, but he's got to get down again.
Oh, Dio.
Oh, mamma mia.
This is indeed an unwarranted intrusion into our privacy.
Be good enough to remove yourself and your machine immediately.
Sisters, return to your work.
- Un momento.
- What is it?
I cannot leave unless I have-a some help.
I need-a men to hold down the tail so I can take off. Fsst!
Men are not permitted here.
No men, no take off.
Mother, perhaps, uh, the sisters-
- Certainly not.
- A pity.
We are the first aviators to make-a the race from London to Paris.
We are not interested in worldly matters.
I understand, Mother, but it is a pity.. . that the race. it will now be won by a Protestant.
Protestant?
Sisters, don't stand around gaping.
This good Catholic needs our help.
Brava! Superiore!
Oh! Ooh!
Don't push!
What's the idea?
Damn silly thing to do!
Nearly frightened the life out of the memsahib!
I'm terribly sorry, sir, but I had no alternative.
Fuel pipe blocked.
You haven't got a pipe cleaner
I could run through it, have you?
Why, we haven't got a pipe cleaner, have we?
Oh, wait a minute.
Would that do?
That's just the thing.
Thank you very much, madam.
I'm a competitor in the Daily Post Air
Race. I suppose you've read about it.
- No. I only read the Times.
- That's right.
Hold on, please.
I think I'll get one of those, Muriel.
I shouldn't, Willy. You're near enough to your wings as it is.
Come on.
Right over here. Could we just have a photograph-
Oh, I say! There's the French chappie. Very good effort.
Well done, sir! We'll take care of the machine.
Well done!
Hey!
Hey, you! No!
Come on!
Quick! Over here!
Danke schön.
Danke schön.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Assassin! Assassin!
Hey!
Ah!
Whoo!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
It's my flying machine
I'm worried about.
- Looks like you're out of the race.
- I wouldn't say that.
Say, do ya think they got any spare wheels on this landing field?
Well, possibly, but it'll take all night to repair that.
- Is there anything wrong with working all night?
- Well, no.
- All right then.
- Good luck.
- Any more to come?
- Let's see now.
Of the 14 starters, eight have landed, two crashed on takeoff, three crashed on the way here, and one. .. is on his way to Scotland?
- Ah!
- Marlene, what are you doing here?
Marlene? No, Françoise.
I am Bulgarian.
But aren't you
- I mean, haven't I met you somewhere before?
- It is possible.
- I see.
Have a drink?
D'accord.
Your attention, please!
Uh, your attention, please! I-I have a sensational announcement.
Sir Percy Ware-Armitage has taken off for France.
H is crossing the channel even now in the dark.
Stop mucking about!
Useless lot!
Oh, evening, sir. Great honor having your eminence onboard our little brig, sir.
I say, careful of that wing.
Courtney!
I say, I hope it isn't going to be rough.
Argh! Smooth as a billiard table, sir. Uh, you did bring the money, sir?
Oh, I never discuss that sort of thing.
You'll have to take it up with my man.
Courtney, are these people to be trusted?
Yes, governor, if you give them 10 guineas each.
Ten guineas? I can get a chambermaid for a year for that.
Do they guarantee to get me over to France before dawn?
Yes, governor.
Courtney, there are 10 of them.
Do you realize this is going to cost your master 100 guineas?
Uh, a hundred and ten.
You'll be paying me the same, I fancy?
Well, you fancy wrong,
Courtney. Impudent oaf!
Any more of this blackmail, I'll have you thrown out of your cottage.
- Now buzz off!
- Sorry.
- Go on! Off you go!
- Just a joke.
- I say, Courtney?
- Yes, governor?
You'll be hearing more of this matter when I return from la belle France.
Good heavens. Sir Percy is flying the channel at this moment.
In the dark? He must be mad. He won't be able to see the railway lines.
- What railway lines?
- I never thought he had the courage.
If we go on deck, sir, we might be able to hear him pass overhead.
Or drop into the sea!
Five guineas each, wasn't it?
Ten, or we go straight back to England.
Outrageous! I shall never hire your boat again.
Hey! The tide's in!
It'll be out in a couple hours. Back on board!
You don't think I'm gonna wait till daylight to be caught by the French?
You'll have to get your feet wet.
You dirty rotter.
I had hoped that I should be dealing with a gentleman.
So had I.
All ashore!
Good-bye!
Just look at those magnificent men... daring the elements, challenging the gods, trying- nay, hoping
- to fly their machines across no less than 22 miles.
Yes, that's what I said-
22 miles of sea!
Welcome to Calais, monsieur.
Give me a hand, will you?
No, no, no! Put me down!
Don't do that! Go away!
What are you doing?
I've gotta get to Calais to compete in the race! Put me down, you ruddy idiots!
Don't be silly!
I haven't got the time!
I've got to get to Calais to continue the race!
Bon voyage, monsieur!
Are you all right,
Lieutenant Parsons?
Don't worry!
We'll soon have you out!
Aah!
Can you swim?
There is nothing a German officer cannot do!
The race is not over yet! We've got to get them refueled and off to Paris!
Richard Mays,
Orvil Newton away from Calais at... 8:50.
La américaine, you can vive who you like, they haven't got a chance.
The fabulous Sir Percy took off for Paris two hours ago.
He's so far in the lead, nothing can stop him. Nothing at all. Ha!
Vive Sir Percy!
What am I saying?
He's a most ghastly person.
Buzz off!
Go on! Bug off!
Blast it!
Driver!
Driver!
Stop the train!
Arretez le train!
Blast!
Look! Go!
Hey, you!
Where can I get some-
Françoise, what are you doing here?
Pardon, monsieur?
- Uh, you are not Françoise?
- No, Yvette. Why?
Hey.
Um, where can I get some gasoline?
At Amiens. It is five kilometers from here.
Uh-huh.
Be a good fellow and bring me as much as possible.
The honor of France is at stake.
- But, Yvette!
- You must go. Go, go, go!
All right! All right, but
I will be a good 30 minutes.
We have 30 minutes.
Excuse me.
Can you see anyone yet?
Yes! Ponticelli is first round the Eiffel Tower.
There are two more on his tail!
This is going to be a close finish, very close indeed.
Count Ponticelli's still ahead, followed by...
Orvil Newton, Richard Mays.
Jump!
And here they come now!
Here's the winner!
It's Richard Mays!
Richard Mays of England!
You get ready to jump now!
- Ponticelli. Ponticelli! You all right?
- Eh?
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.
Emilio! Emilio!
Emilio! Ohh!
Patricia?
Oh, Richard! Oh, Richard!
You won!
Oh, Richard! You won! You won! You won! I'm so pleased.
- What happened to Ponticelli?
- Well, his machine caught fire.
Orvil was marvelous!
He had to stop to pick him up.
H could have won though.
Hey, Richard!
Richard.
Richard, congratulations.
Well done, Richard!
Congratulations!
Well, you deserve it more than I do. It was a wonderful thing you did.
You'd have done the same thing if you'd have seen him.
Well, you did it.
Let's call it a tie.
We'll share the prize.
The city of Paris salutes the gallant victor!
Pierre Dubois is coming!
Pierre!
You remember me, don't you?
- Yes, of course. You-You are- You are-
- Betty.
Betty! Of course. Oh.
How could I ever forget?
Every time I look at you, my heart sings.
Oh!
Will you pardon me?
I better have a look at my undercarriage.
It's been taking an awful beating.
I think we ought to go and find somewhere to put-
We must have your photograph by your machine, monsieur.
Over here. This way.
And now you stop flying, huh?
- Do I have to?
- You have to.
Not for me, but for bambinos.
By now they're used to it.
- Another one?
- Uh-huh.
In that-a case,
I give up.
- Emilio.
- Sophia.
Turn around.
- Whoops!
- Oh!
So ended the 1910 air race.
The winner's time:
25 hours, 11 minutes.
Today the same distance can be covered by supersonic jets in seven minutes, but it can take longer.
May I have your attention, please?
We regret to announce that the departure of all planes from London to Paris... have been delayed again, owing to bad weather.
Buses are waiting outside to take you back to your hotels.
Will you all come this way, please?
Will you all follow me?

There's an old story.
The way the Apaches tell it...
...a man was riding in the desert and came across a vulture...
...the kind they call turkey buzzards in Arizona, sittin' on a rock.
"Hey," the man says, "how come you old turkey buzzard's sittin' here?
"I saw you flying over Hadleyberg, and I didn't want to meet up with you...
"...so I turned around and come this way."
Old turkey buzzard says:
"That's funny,
I was only passing through that town.
"I was really coming over here to wait for you."
A thousand years ago, in the Southwest, there was an Apache legend.
It told about a hidden canyon, guarded by the Apache gods and rich with gold.
As long as the Apaches kept the canyon a secret and never touched the gold...
...they would be strong, powerful.
That was the legend.
When the Spanish Conquistadores came, they searched for that canyon.
They called it "Cañón Del Oro," meaning Canyon of Gold.
But they never found it.
Three hundred years later, the Americans came.
They heard about the legend, but they called the canyon, "The Lost Adams."
That was because a man named Adams saw it once, or so he said.
But whether he did or not, he never saw anythin' again...
...because the Apaches burned out his eyes.
Everybody knew about that legend and a lot of people believed it.
Cañón Del Oro. The Lost Adams.
And then for a while there, back in 1874, they called it, "Mackenna's Gold."
Take it easy, old man.
You're not healthy enough to play games.
I know you. You are Mackenna.
-The marshal.
-That's right, but I don't know you.
Why'd you try to bushwhack me?
Somebody pay you?
-Colorado?
-No pay. Nobody pay.
-Well, then, why?
-Because you look for gold.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, an old man like you...
...going around shooting at prospectors.
Keep that up, you're gonna get in trouble.
Besides, if you know me, you know
I quit gold huntin' a long time ago.
The only dust I ever found was prairie dust.
Never got rich but I sure got thirsty.
But now you look for the gold again.
-Everybody look for the gold.
-What gold?
What gold?
I know this place. That's Shaking Rock.
No gold around there.
I've been there.
Why you stay with me?
Why you not kill me?
Well, that's what I oughta do.
Tell you what, you give me your word you won't go around...
...pickin' off people anymore, and I'll take you home.
No home.
Well, I'll get you to a doctor, anyway.
I die here.
Now you have the gold.
But you will wish you never see this map.
The spirits will kill you. No laugh.
It is a secret place.
So that's what it's supposed to be.
Cañón Del Oro, The Lost Adams.
Don't worry, old man,
I won't go looking for it.
Wasted three good years chasing that wild goose. There is no Lost Adams.
It is bad time.
Young warriors want gold...
...like white men.
It is good time for old man to die.
Plenty of time for that, old man.
Don't rush it.
Feel like eating something?
Old man?
Old man.
I wish you hadn't shot at me.
I thought maybe you were someone else.
Soldiers. Many soldiers.
Sir, you have been most kind and we are grateful.
We ask no more of your hospitality than the loan of a few horses and mules...
...which we need, and some food for our journey.
Also, we will take your wife...
...because if we run into trouble with the Cavalry she may come in useful.
If we pass this way again, God willing,
I will sell her back to you.
That is a true promise.
Take a rest, Marshal.
We will finish the old man's grave.
We'll make it a little longer, a little wider...
...and then maybe we will bury you together.
God is good to me.
You remember?
I told you I would come for you, old friend.
You'll never get back, old friend.
I will find a way.
Put that shovel down and come and talk to Colorado.
Don't move, Mackenna, or I'll cut you in half.
Now come out like a gentlemen.
You know, we've been trailing that old man for two weeks now.
-Where's the map?
-Map? What map?
I know this fellow.
He's a good card player.
He always remembers the cards.
If he saw the map, he remembers it.
So we have a map in his head.
I told you.
I told you nobody runs me out.
And now I have you, and you will take us to the gold.
And then I will kill you.
Hurry up, Besh.
Cover him with some rocks and let's go.
No. He is a chief.
He was going to Cañón Del Oro.
We bury him there.
Are you crazy?
You know how bad he's going to stink by the time we get there?
Of course. He's a chief.
He must be buried there.
I should have thought of it myself.
Besh, come on.
In the old days, before Mackenna ran him out of the territory...
...Colorado had a hideout in a little box canyon.
Now that he was back, he was using it again.
And that's where he took Mackenna, his living map.
You're crazy to come back.
You know Judge Bergerman put a price on your head.
You know, that's funny. I never lay eyes on that Judge Bergerman.
But he don't like me.
Well, someday me and him will meet.
And I will take his head, in a basket.
Anyway, I came back after that map you burned up.
Why? You can buy a dozen just like it for a dollar a piece.
Not like that map. Not like the map old Prairie Dog was carrying.
Well, that old man wasn't Prairie Dog.
Prairie Dog is dead.
He sure is now.
The whole thing is a fairy tale.
There's no Cañón Del Oro.
Old Adams was never there.
Then why did you kill
Prairie Dog and take his map?
-That's not the way it happened.
-I know how it happened.
You just got tired of working for $20 a month...
...so you took advantage of that poor old man.
You bushwhacked him, gunned him down, and took his map.
I'm surprised at you. A marshal.
-Hesh-ke remembers you.
-I remember her, too.
Hesh-ke.
What I can't figure out is how you knew about this map. It's the only real one.
It was supposed to be only in Prairie Dog's head.
He was supposed to pass it on before he died.
Then somebody found out there really was a map.
And two weeks ago, the old man up and left the tribe.
Well, why didn't he pass it on?
I guess he didn't know who he could trust.
See, the Apache have changed.
They're beginning to think like white men now.
Some of the young think they got more use for that gold than those old spirits.
There isn't any gold.
And if there was, it would belong to the whole tribe.
You're wrong.
That gold belongs to the spirits, and they said I can have it.
Listen, old friend, I know you.
You're just like an Apache: Very stubborn.
These other friends of mine here, they are stubborn, too.
Why don't you just take us there and we'll be partners?
-There's enough for all of us.
-I've been there.
There's not enough gold there to fill your back tooth.
-You've been in the canyon?
-There's no canyon.
You don't know.
Listen, you like to gamble.
Let's take a chance.
Suppose we lose?
Well, then we split up and you go wherever you want.
How? On foot with my hands tied behind my back?
No. I'll give you anything you need.
Water, horses, your guns.
-When?
-When what?
The guns?
When you take us there.
I mean, you gotta prove yourself, no?
I'll tell you what else I'll give you.
I will give you the girl.
-What girl?
-The one you've been looking at.
I tell you the truth. Her husband's rich.
-You will get a big reward.
-No!
Monkey, what do we want?
We want the gold. Why?
Because when we get the gold, we can buy all the women we want.
Besides, if Laguna don't show up tomorrow, it's an extra share for all of us.
No.
You want the Scar-face? Take her.
Take the little fat one.
Take the old woman.
You can have lots of fun.
What do you say, we shake on it?
All right.
I'll take you there.
And the gold is all yours.
I'll take you there and then I go, like you said.
No gold?
Why?
You like Hadleyberg so much?
They don't like you. That's what I hear.
I'll tell you the truth. I'm superstitious.
I don't want to tangle with those Indian spirits.
-Okay. You're crazy, but okay.
-And another thing.
You tell your little boy there
I want all my stuff back.
Sure. I keep everything safe for you until you go.
But there's no gold and there's no canyon.
I make the jokes, compadre.
Hesh-ke.
You're lucky.
Looks like she ain't holding no grudge.
She was mad. I think she still likes you.
Too bad I already gave her to Monkey.
You want to change your mind?
Sleep well, old friend.
Miss.
You know me. I'm Mackenna, the marshal.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You know me.
It was your father who made me marshal.
They killed my father.
They killed my father.
Don't tell any of them, nobody, that you're Judge Bergerman's daughter.
If Colorado finds that out, you'll be in worse trouble than you are now.
You understand?
You hear me?
Yes, I remember you.
You came out to the ranch once for supper.
That's right. I was once.
They say you like to play cards.
Well, yes, I enjoy an unfriendly game of poker from time to time.
Off-duty, of course.
I take a drink now and then, too.
My father didn't hold with gambling and neither do I.
Well, I know, Miss. I know that.
I'm trying to mend my ways. Seriously.
It doesn't look right for a marshal to be playing cards. I know that.
Now you rest.
Try to sleep.
And remember what I told you.
We start early tomorrow.
Go get some sleep.
You see, I keep my end of the deal, old friend. You keep yours.
Better put your belt on.
You could lose your pants.
-Okay, come on.
-Ain't we gonna wait for Laguna?
Naw. He likes that girl in Hadleyberg so much, let him get rich with her.
Man comes with flag.
Hesh-ke, take the girl inside.
I don't think they're looking for you,
Marshal.
But if they are, I would like to kill you.
I don't know how I'd get you to that canyon if you did.
You could with a broken kneecap.
Painful, but possible.
If you want to collect the reward on that girl, remember that Hesh-ke has a knife.
Colorado!
John Colorado!
Ben!
Ben Baker! Ben!
-My old friend!
-No!
Stay where you are, Colorado.
Who's that with you?
Why, Marshal. You and Colorado together.
Well, well, well.
-Surprised?
-No.
Some of the people with me might be, but not me.
Not with a stake like this one.
No, this is no time for holding old grudges.
Speaking for myself, I'm glad you're here.
We can play some poker.
Not with your cards.
Welcome back, Colorado.
And there's enough for all of us.
-Enough?
-We know all about it.
We know you've been looking for Prairie Dog.
We know you got the word from Besh and Little Hatchet here.
How? And how'd you know we were here?
Nobody but us knows about this place.
Laguna.
Sorry, Colorado.
You know me.
-I drink too much, then I talk too much.
-Yeah.
Then they had me.
You see, didn't I say
Laguna shouldn't go into Hadleyberg?
Colorado, it's a big desert.
It's going to take a lot of eyes to find that old man.
And after that, it's going to be a long way to the canyon.
There's cavalry out after you.
More than you've ever seen.
And a lot of bronco Apaches on the prowl, after anybody and everybody.
Probably after the gold, too.
You don't know what's going on out there.
You need us.
One more thing.
You got yourself a mighty fine place here, but it's a box canyon.
One way in, same way out.
We could camp outside until you get awful hungry.
Well, there's a lot in what you say.
Of course, if the soldiers catch us together, you will hang together with me.
If Mackenna's gonna take a chance with you...
...that's good enough for me.
Well, what do you think, Mackenna?
I'm glad he's here.
Like he says, we can play some poker along the way.
Besh, with respect, move the chief.
It is true that there's enough for all of us.
But it is also true that it's a long way to the canyon.
It's a deal.
Come up and have some breakfast.
Hold it!
He double-crossed me.
You all knew I'd kill him the first chance I got.
Anyway, there's enough for all of us, only now there'll be a little bit more.
Okay.
Only no more killing, or there sure will be a lot of it.
You know, Ben, we've got a deal, but...
...I wish I could have seen all your friends before we made it.
What's wrong with them?
These two, I don't know what they are.
And I'm afraid to guess.
We were just passing through Hadleyberg...
...and I'm afraid we overheard a most interesting conversation.
Mr. Baker was kind enough to allow us to join the group.
He promised this to be good sport.
And profitable, too.
Is that so?
Is that so?
Colorado.
Yeah. "Good sport."
I know this fellow.
You're the storekeeper from Hadleyberg.
Does your wife know where you are?
I don't know this one, but he looks pale, too.
What are you? A dentist?
No. He's the editor of the Hadleyberg Gazette.
-This one looks like a preacher.
-I preach.
-Yeah? What you preach, gold?
-The Word of God.
Yeah, but you like gold, right?
It can work for the Lord as well as the devil.
Why should only the Church of Rome have gold?
Gold, silver, idols and corruption.
When I get my gold...
-Your gold?
-...my share.
My share will build a tabernacle to the Lord.
A temple of the true Gospel, a whole string of 'em through the territory.
Ben, to bring this fella, you gotta be crazier than he is.
I told you, everybody knows.
You can't keep gold a secret.
It travels in the air.
Anyway, we can use every gun we can get, no matter who carries it.
Mackenna.
Preacher, this isn't going to be like a walk to church on Sunday.
You might get yourself killed.
Might have to do some killing yourself.
The Lord knows what he wants his servants to do.
Anyway, that gold belongs to the Apache.
It can be used for them, to bring 'em to the Lord.
Ay, Chihuahua!
He makes a good deal with his Lord.
Now we come to the last and the best.
A blind man and a kid.
I see good enough for both of us.
That old man has a better right to be here than we have.
Don't you know him?
That's Adams himself.
Adams?
That's Adams.
-You see? That's Adams.
-I see Adams.
-I don't see any gold.
-There's gold there.
More gold than you ever saw.
All the gold in the world.
Yeah, tell him. Tell him the story.
No. It's been told too many times.
But we're gonna take you back there.
Go on, Mr. Adams.
-Tell us.
-No.
Well, it was the Mexican that took us there...
...the one who was brought up by the Apaches.
He didn't want no gold for himself.
He was afraid.
Kept talking about the old Apache spirits.
All he wanted was a string of horses.
So we gave it to him.
The way he took us there...
...twisting and turning, and mostly by night.
We never knew where we were.
And at the last, he made us put on blindfolds.
When we took 'em off...
...there it was...
...the prettiest little valley you ever saw.
Sparkling and shining in the sun.
It was just like a dream.
Indians used to live there 1,000 years ago, maybe even more.
And gold everywhere!
The canyon wall had streaks...
...five yards, ten yards wide.
On the canyon floor, there were nuggets laying all over the ground. Pure gold.
Gold dust in every clump of brush.
You couldn't put a pan in the river without showing colour.
Well, the first day we filled a great big coffee pot with just nuggets.
No one could lift it.
Well, we built a shack.
Went to work.
Next thing, the Apaches were there.
They killed everyone, except me.
Then they fixed my eyes, and left me in the desert.
I wasn't any older than this lad here.
Tell 'em about the nugget.
Well, when I got found...
...I still had one little nugget in my pocket. Just a little one.
$190 it was worth.
Just a little one.
You know something? You're pretty.
I don't know if you are a boy or a girl.
If you are a boy,
I'm going to give you a haircut.
If you are a girl, I am going to kiss you.
I think you are a girl.
That's Hachita.
Soldiers!
Now who's going to do it, your men or mine?
-Yours. You have more to spare.
-We'll cut for it.
Okay. But I shuffle.
When we move out...
...you gentlemen head straight for the Cavalry.
Tell them about Colorado.
You tell 'em I'm his prisoner.
What? I don't understand.
How could you be his prisoner?
-You trying to get rid of us?
-I'm trying to save your lives.
Forget about the gold, Mr. Weaver, there isn't any.
-Get back to your store.
-I don't believe you. You're lying!
You know better. Get out.
A man like you has no business here.
There's good use for gold.
Do a lot for the territory.
-Forget about it. Do what I tell you.
-No.
These men have gold fever.
Get out of this. Get to the Cavalry.
Mackenna.
-What is he telling you?
-The truth. I told them to go home.
Why are you so selfish?
You can't keep it all for yourself.
Did he tell you that he killed Prairie Dog?
He burned the map, but he knows where the canyon is.
-That's the truth.
-Well, now, that's more like it.
I never trusted you, Mackenna.
I knew it was a mistake to let the judge talk us into making you a marshal.
A man from nowhere. A drifter.
You never were one of us.
-I cleaned up your town.
-Where's your badge now?
Marshal, did you really kill that old man?
Sure, but it was self-defence.
You're a murderer!
It's been a nice, quick trial.
When's the hanging?
What's all this talk of hanging?
We're all friends here. All partners.
Inga! What are you doing here?
Why is she here?
I will tell you.
I will tell you the whole truth.
On our way to meet Mackenna, when he sent for us...
...we ran out of food, so we stopped at a little ranch.
We expected to pay, but the man...
...he starts to shoot.
So we beg, "Please, stop!"
He's crazy. He won't listen.
So we thought the best thing to do, make her a partner, give her a full share.
Your father's dead?
But what can we do now? Nothing.
We'll never get another chance like this.
-You mean it was an accident?
-I swear it.
I, myself, said a prayer over his grave.
Well, we can't bring him back now, that's for sure. Right, Fuller?
No, we can't.
Right, storekeeper?
I don't know. I don't know what to think.
This isn't what I expected.
I didn't think it would be like this.
I don't know what to do.
You can get out of this, all of you, before it's too late.
Gentlemen, forgive me, I'm a stranger here so I haven't followed a good deal of this...
...but I do feel it would be a terrible pity if we fell out among ourselves...
...or if we abandoned what we all set out to accomplish.
I mean, we're embarked on a great adventure, gentlemen.
Something that comes only once in a lifetime.
So, I propose that we forget the past, whatever may have occurred...
...and all go forward.
He's right!
Why else do you think the good God brings us all together like this?
It's true, Padrecito?
I have nothing to say to you.
The Lord has his own ways and I have my own reasons for being here.
So we agree,
Mackenna takes us to the canyon.
Sure, we agree.
We all agree to get rich.
We're all going to be millionaires.
Every one of you.
That's what you think, and nothing else matters.
The best man your town had has been murdered.
And all you can say is,
"Well, we can't bring him back."
Not much of an epitaph, is it?
It's all you've got time for.
You can't see, you can't hear, you don't want to know anything but that gold.
You're sick with it, all of you.
I started out being his prisoner and now I've got you all on my back.
There's no gold, no canyon.
There's nothing.
It's just a story that this old man tells to get himself free drinks.
I'll take you there. I got no choice.
But I'll tell you this, not many of you will be coming back.
There is gold.
I saw it. All the gold in the world.
Come on. We're wasting time.
You know, I'm beginning not to trust you.
I trust you.
My God, after all these years, don't you know you mount a horse on the left side?
They figured they had only one chance of gettin' past the Cavalry...
...and they had a plan.
They'd gotten the squaw so drunk she couldn't talk.
And two of Baker's men were gonna ride her right into the camp...
...making out they were being chased by Apaches.
And while Hachita, Besh, and Monkey were carryin' on...
...as though they were a whole raidin' party...
...all the rest were gonna take off a different way.
If it all went well, they'd meet up later.
That was the plan.
And with a little bit of luck, it just could work.
What's going on?
I can't tell, sir.
Don't shoot!
It's a squaw.
Tied to the horse!
Easy. Easy.
Where's the sergeant?
Get out of the way.
All right, let go.
What the hell's going on here, Sergeant?
Pie-eyed, sir.
I'll get some black coffee into her.
Maybe we'll make some sense out of this.
All right, the party's over.
Get back to your posts, all of you.
Do you hear me? Move!
So now they were all together.
The good citizens and the outlaws...
...and Mackenna and the girl.
They made for the waterhole at the old Brogan ranch...
...because it was the last chance to fill up before they hit the desert.
The Apaches had burnt out the old
Brogan place about five years before.
Nobody ever took it over because it was too far out.
But everybody knew about the waterhole, and everybody used it.
It was kind of neutral territory.
It's the Cavalry!
We're surrounded. It's the Cavalry!
I'm Judge Fuller!
You're making a mistake.
I'm Judge Fuller!
I'm editor of the Gazette!
I've captured Colorado!
Don't shoot! I've captured Colorado!
Don't shoot!
I've got old man Adams here.
Don't shoot, please!
Riding in this country without a gun?
Very reckless.
I knew we could depend on you.
Miss?
Leave her alone.
I mean leave her.
No. We're back to the way things were.
You gave her to me, don't you remember?
We're short of water and she's slowing us up.
So leave her.
-Get out of the way.
-No.
I'm not much good to you dead.
Has it crossed your mind that you'll never see that canyon if you kill me?
I won't kill you, but I'll hurt you awful bad.
So get out of the way.
There's plenty of water.
Less than two hours from here.
Are you crazy?
Just keep your eye on the dealer.
You're good.
You're really good.
-For this I give you Monkey's share.
-Yeah.
Come on, enjoy!
Mr. Mackenna, I want to thank you...
...for everything.
That's all right.
Your father and I never had much to say to each other...
...but he was a good man.
That's lucky for me.
Excuse me, but is there something between you and that Indian girl?
No.
There was a long time ago.
Then after I got the marshal's job,
I had to go out and collect her brother.
Then he got himself hanged.
Don't make her mad. She's kind of crazy.
Why aren't you married?
I guess I never found a man who could hold a candle to my father.
I guess not.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You like to be dirty?
Show you a new way to get your clothes clean.
I'll never understand the gringo, never.
It's all your fault.
You know Hesh-ke.
You know she has a terrible temper.
I'm sorry. If Hesh-ke's got her mind made up to kill that girl, she'll do it.
You gave her to me and I don't want her damaged.
I can't watch her every minute.
What's the matter with you?
We've got enough partners now.
Besides, this will keep those Apache happy for awhile.
Some scout.
The man leading that Cavalry patrol was Sergeant Tibbs.
"Foxy" Tibbs his men called him.
He knew his way around.
Old "Foxy" Tibbs and his eight men just kept followin' on.
At the end of the first day, he sent two men back to the company...
...so they could show the lieutenant the trail.
And every day after, he kept sending two more men back, in kind of a relay.
And he hung on their heels, fast or slow.
Finally, it was five against five.
You two in the back, get going.
Good.
Now we can double back and take them one by one.
Yeah, that's good.
When they see us comin', they can turn around...
...and lead us right back into the arms of the whole company two by two.
Of course, they won't hang me.
Now I'll tell you what you can do.
Send the girl back to the troopers.
-Why?
-Well, for one thing, she holds us up.
They wouldn't be able to keep up with us if they had her on their hands.
No.
All right.
You've probably got a better idea.
No. I have no better idea.
-Only this one better work.
-It'll work.
-I'll tell her.
-Sure, you tell her.
-I can tell her.
-I know.
Miss.
You're free to go over there and join the soldiers. They'll get you home.
It wouldn't be fair to leave you here all alone.
He's not alone. He's got me.
I think I should stay, Mr. Mackenna.
Look, lady, you'd better go before I change my mind.
I'll come by for supper some night when I get back.
Now git!
Stay here. And keep your eyes open.
Well, that gets rid of her, anyway.
You've had a hard time, Miss Bergerman.
You have my sympathy.
Thank you. Sergeant, you will be able to do something about Mr. Mackenna?
Yes, I think I can.
Now there were only four of them left.
That made the odds a little better for Mackenna.
Only thing was Hesh-ke had ideas.
She wanted Mackenna back now.
And now the girl was gone, she figured there was nothin' to stop her.
Thanks.
Mackenna, don't make her mad.
Colorado, someone comes.
Stop! Now!
Take it easy. I'm coming in.
Take it slow.
Stay where you are.
I've come to join up.
I hope there won't be any trouble about it.
-You expect us to believe that?
-Don't!
He's a murderer.
He killed two men, his own men.
That's right.
That's right.
That means I have two extra horses.
Good horses. They'll come in real handy when we find the gold.
Oh, yes, the little lady here told me all about it.
Of course, I already had a pretty good idea from the squaw.
All right. But you're a foolish man.
Suppose we say okay now and sometime in the night we change our minds?
Tonight, tomorrow night, you got to sleep sometime.
I'll get my sleep.
There's no point in your killing me.
Not for one share, more or less.
-Besides, you need me.
-Oh, no.
We don't need you.
We've got enough trouble without you.
The Army'll be looking for you. They'd be more anxious to hang you than me.
No. They'll think you did it, or Apache, and I was taken prisoner.
During all this time that I've been chasing you around...
...l've thought it all out.
Yeah, you do need me.
You know how much gold weighs?
You especially, Mr. Mackenna.
How much is there? $1,000,000?
More? In raw gold.
There's not enough of us here to carry it out.
But with me, you've got a better chance of getting there and out alive.
You're right, Sergeant.
You're welcome, Sergeant.
Coffee for the sergeant.
Only don't forget, I'm the captain.
A sergeant who kills two of his own troopers.
-What do you think of that?
-Not a hell of a lot.
Now, be reasonable, Mackenna.
Oh, thank you.
After all, a man of my age and rank, there's no future for me in the Army.
Do you mind, Sergeant?
Why don't you stay with your new partners?
No hard feelings I hope, Miss Bergerman.
Easy, friend.
Mackenna's too precious to me.
Miss Bergerman?
Could it be that she's the little girl of my old friend, the judge?
Mackenna, we'll never be true friends if you keep secrets from me.
Let's go.
To get away from the Cavalry, they headed for the ferry on Yellow River.
They figured they could cross over on the raft there...
...and then double back on the trail later.
But what they didn't know was...
...that the Apaches had taken over the whole Yellow River territory.
And there was another thing they didn't know:
Some other Apaches had already burned down the ferry.
But they had been in a hurry, and the raft was still afloat.
They still had a chance.
Help me! The current's too strong!
Get out of here!
Damn Prairie Dog!
And don't you go saying we ought to take him with us.
All right, let's go.
Now they were there. They'd reached it.
They'd reached the place
Mackenna knew as Shaking Rock.
We're here.
Where's the canyon?
Tomorrow. At sunrise.
Who says?
The map says.
-You nervous?
-No. Just thinking.
Mackenna.
-So we'll get into that canyon tomorrow--
-Not we, Sergeant. I'm not going in.
Maybe.
You might change your mind.
And you know as well as I do...
...that Colorado's not going to share the gold with anybody.
You've had time to figure that out?
Enough. Now look, Mackenna, you and I, we ought to stick together.
The way you stuck to your two soldiers?
Well, this is where the map ends.
I expect you to keep your word.
Show me the canyon and I will.
Well, if it's anywhere around here, you'll see it tomorrow morning.
I want my guns. And I want the girl.
Tomorrow.
And if there's no gold,
I still get the guns and the girl.
There is gold.
You'll never know if you shove that thing any farther.
I'm not in the mood for jokes.
What'll you do with it? Your share, I mean.
That's my business.
Well, all right.
I know what you think.
One big drunk in every stinking saloon in Sonora, till it's all gone.
-Is that all you think I want?
-That's the way it's always been with you.
Sure, because there was never enough for what I really want.
But when I get the gold, they'll never see
Colorado around here again. Never.
Good. Where will you go?
Sorry.
Maybe I will tell you. But if you laugh...
I won't laugh.
A millionaire in Paris.
That's right.
What is it?
Well, for whatever it's worth, he says he's going to let us go tomorrow morning.
I don't know what's going to happen, but from the minute you wake up...
...you keep your eye on me.
However it goes, we're gonna have to move fast.
Do we have to?
Can't we see the gold first?
-There isn't any gold.
-But there was a map.
You saw it. It brought us here. You said we could see the canyon in the morning.
-I heard you.
-I said a lot of things to keep us alive.
I've been running the bluff of my life.
And tomorrow morning is the showdown.
But we've come so far.
And then not even to see it.
No, listen, my father wasn't rich.
After my mother died, I wasn't only his daughter, I was his ranch hand...
...because we couldn't afford to keep one.
But with my share,
I could buy a real ranch, a big one.
If I had your place,
I wouldn't be the marshal for five minutes.
You don't have to.
With your share, you can do anything you want to.
You like to gamble.
Build a gambling house.
-I'll be your partner.
-You're out of your mind.
Now, wake up! Your share, my share, there aren't going to be any shares.
I know him.
He doesn't share with anybody.
I'm sorry.
I must be crazy.
You've done so much for me. Everything.
And I'm nothing but trouble.
I don't know why you bother with me.
I have to. We're partners.
-Well, what happens?
-I never would have believed it.
I think you're gonna see that canyon in about a minute.
-My guns.
-No, not until I see the canyon.
All right. Look at the rock.
Watch that shadow.
-What makes this?
-I don't know.
Might be a quartz deposit.
Look!
Come on!
Up there!
Mackenna! Look! I'm covered in gold.
-Come on. We're getting out.
-Getting out? No, why?
Listen to me. If we don't get away, we're going to be killed.
We're not staying, not for all the gold in the world. So start climbing.
No. No bullets. I take them all.
-When?
-Last night.
The spirits tell me what to do.
This is Apache gold. They tell me...
...kill everyone today.
Even you, Colorado.
You are not Apache.
Don't look down.
Keep going! Climb!
Come on, keep going.
Come on. Just a little further.
You can do it.
Come on, try. A little bit more.
Come on.
Come on, climb.
Climb. Come on.
I can't.
Try!
Goodbye, old friend. No more jokes.
Mackenna!
Goodbye, Mackenna.
You know I'm coming after you.
Stay away from me, Mackenna.
Find a hole, old friend.
Make it deep.

Portsmouth, December, 1787.
I looked upon the vessel
that was to take me to the Island of Tahiti.
A destination so far from England
that one couldn't go farther
without starting to come home.
And the length of the journey was equaled
by the importance of its mission.
What could be more vital
than to find and cultivate
a nourishing new food
that cost nothing to grow?
A blessing for the poor,
the hungry of the world.
It was a mission close to my heart.
And it was I who had been chosen
from amongst
all the gardeners in England.
Oh, beg pardon.
Can you tell me if this boat is the Bounty?
- Boat, did you say?
- Yes.
- A boat! It's a ship, you landlubber.
- Hey, what kind of a seaman's this?
- He's a peddler.
- You selling something, chum?
I'm not a peddler. I'm a gardener.
Assistant Botanist at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew.
You know Kew Gardens, of course.
Kew's outside London.
You lost your way, mate.
Well, I haven't lost my way if this boat,
I beg your pardon, if this ship is the Bounty.
Aye, it's the Bounty, all right.
Then, perhaps one of you gentlemen could tell me where I sign on?
I wonder what a gardener's doing onboard, huh?
Gonna plant roses in me hammock, are you?
Good thing, too, the way you smell.
Hold on, hold on. Look. Empty pots.
I know. We're going to Tahiti to fill them with something, right?
Well, one usually fills empty pots with something.
- What'd you got here? Little telescope?
- Be careful, please.
These are scientific documents.
Agronomy records.
- They're what?
- Agronomy records.
They're sketches, really.
- Sketches?
- Sketches of breadfruit.
- Breadfruit?
- Breadfruit?
You mean, where we're going, bread grows on trees?
Bread trees.
That's daft enough for a shipload, eh?
There's nothing daft about breadfruit.
It is a very real food. A staple, like wheat.
- Here.
- Goofy-looking weed.
It's funny that nobody's ever heard of this before, then.
No one ever heard of the potato until Sir Francis Drake brought it from South America.
It altered European economy.
Breadfruit may alter it again.
I wonder what it tastes like.
The West Indies Company plans to feed it to the slaves in Jamaica no matter what it tastes like.
But then, if it becomes popular, they'll feed it to the world.
Gentlemen, we're about to embark on a very momentous journey.
Personally, I'm proud to be part of it.
Now, where do I sign on?
I'll show you. Come along with me.
Breadfruit? Did you ever hear of that? A breadfruit?
Now come on, love, you got me money.
What more do you want?
- But when do you get paid?
- Now, come on, love. Get off the ship.
Hey, Scratch.
Sign on me mate here, will you?
Make your mark right there.
Captain coming aboard!
He was master of the Resolution under Captain Cook.
- What's he like?
- A hard one.
- I sailed under him.
- But he walks like a sailor, anyway.
- Mr. Fryer.
- Captain, sir.
- How is the crew shaping?
- A prime lot, I'd say, sir.
- And all volunteers.
- Good.
I'd like my chest brought aboard,
Mr. Fryer.
If you have a sober hand who can be trusted not to desert.
At your service, sir.
Mills is a good man, sir.
Remain by my cabin.
I'll have other errands.
Aye, aye, sir.
Come on, give me a hand, mate.
You're not backward in pushing yourself forward, are you?
You keep your pork-nose where it belongs and give me a hand with the Captain's gear.
Well, don't be touchy, mate.
Got a long voyage ahead, you know.
That's true. There it is.
Always speak up for the easy tasks in port, to be spared the difficult ones at sea.
What's this? A Royal visit?
That's Mr. Christian's carriage, sir.
Is it, now?
So, I've had a career fop palmed onto me as a first mate.
- You haven't met him yet, sir?
- He was assigned only yesterday.
Moorechild was my choice.
He was taken ill with some malady or other.
Aye, nothing compares with a woman washed all over, smelling like a Frenchman.
Fletcher Christian, Lieutenant, come aboard to join, sir.
Lieutenant Christian.
You are a naval lieutenant, I presume?
Yes. Please forgive my appearance, sir.
I was staying with friends in the country when my orders reached me.
- So, I came directly.
- I see.
- This is Mr. Fryer, our sailing master.
- Oh, yes.
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Fryer.
- Same to you, Mr. Christian.
Yes, we sailed together.
Let me show your men your cabin.
Your pardon, sir.
You've come none too soon.
Please be about your duties without delay.
Your indulgence, sir.
I have two charming friends here who insist upon seeing me to my ship.
And they also insist upon meeting the Captain.
They say it's important.
- Very well.
- Thank you.
- Hello, Ned.
- Fletcher.
- How are you?
- I'd heard you were going to be with us.
- Yes. We'll be together.
- What luck.
- Well, if you'll excuse me.
- Certainly.
We'll dine together.
Wonderful lad.
His mother's a great friend of the family.
Lady Young. Wonderful horsewoman, also.
Trains them herself, if you can imagine.
I'll try.
I'm sorry, Madam. I do not speak French.
Oh, for shame, Captain.
That's uncivilized of you.
I humbly apologize.
May I present Captain Bligh, the Lady Gwendolyn Arbast.
- Milady.
- Delighted to meet you, Captain.
May I compliment you upon your distinguished record of command?
The compliment's slightly premature, Milady.
This is my first captaincy.
- The first of many, I'm sure.
- Thank you.
Good luck, Captain.
Come along, Therese.
Excuse me, sir.
No, don't bother to come with us, Fletcher.
Last minute attentions are always hollow and you are insincere to start with.
Oh, dear.
Well, sir,
I understand we're taking this river scow halfway round the world on a grocer's errand.
I take a somewhat different view.
So do their Lordships of the Admiralty.
- Do they really? How extraordinary.
- Tell me, what is a man of your particular interests doing in the navy?
Oh, process of elimination.
There's something dusty about the army and affairs of state are rather a bore.
You know, one must do something.
Here's a fellow trying to catch your eye, sir.
Looks like an embalmer.
Beg pardon, sir. Might I have a word?
- Are you our gardener from Kew?
- Yes, sir. Brown, sir.
- Good. Found your quarters yet?
- No, sir.
Get him a good billet.
This is the most important man aboard.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Well, I'm hardly that, but thank you, sir.
I have a message for you, sir, from our chief botanist.
Well, what is it?
He has reached the conclusion that the breadfruit has a dormant period, sir.
According to his experiments, it begins some time in October.
A dormant period?
Four or five months when the fruit cannot be transplanted.
The cuttings die.
Well, October's some way off.
That shouldn't worry us, unless your botanist is wrong about the date.
Exactly, sir.
- Mr. Christian.
- Yes, sir?
Oh, sir, does it really matter when these vegetables arrive in Jamaica?
It matters to the tune of £1,000 a day, Mr. Christian.
My word, that is an impressive amount, yes.
The West India merchants are impressed by it.
So is the Admiralty. And so am I.
It is my intention to land our cargo in Jamaica, as far ahead of the Admiralty's timetable as is humanly possible.
Yes. Well, one can understand that.
Doing so, one can look forward to promotions and even honors.
And all that, yes.
I will do exactly all that, Mr. Christian.
Which brings me to the subject of yourself.
I will tolerate nothing less than a man's best efforts, officer or seaman.
Highborn connections are no substitute for hard work.
No, indeed they're not, sir.
But, personally, I see no reason why a good officer cannot be a gentleman, as well.
- Do you disagree, sir?
- Not if he's first a good officer.
It's a debatable point, but a good subject for a dinner's conversation.
But I'm keeping Mr. Brown waiting.
And I mustn't neglect the most important man on our ship.
Excuse me, sir.
Hello, Brown.
- Make ready for sail, Mr. Christian.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Hands to stations for leaving harbor!
Aye, aye, sir!
All hands to stations for leaving harbor!
All hands on deck!
All hands to stations for leaving harbor!
All right, now, heavy on it!
Step round.
Let go and hold!
Ship ready for sea, sir.
Set topsails and headsails. Starboard tack.
Set topsails and headsails.
Set topsails and headsails!
Set gallants!
- Set gallants!
- Sheet home!
Set royals!
Set royals!
Midships, steady as she goes.
- Bos'n's mate!
- Aye, sir?
Pipe up spirits.
Up spirits!
Watch below, muster for grog on the upper deck!
Hey, Mills.
Mr. Christian wants a word with you on the quarterdeck.
The fact is,
I'm a little slow sometimes and...
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.
Mack here is reporting a theft.
- What? Already?
- Aye, sir.
Carry on with your investigations.
Seaman Mills at your service, sir.
No labor too long, no job too hard, sir.
Well, you're a light-hearted fellow, as well as a light-fingered one.
Sir?
It seems that in a moment of exuberance, you stole two 25-pound cheeses.
I stole two 25-pound cheeses, sir?
You wish to deny it?
Well, speak up, Mills.
Why, yes I do, sir. Of course. Certainly, sir.
First of all, sir,
I'd be grateful to know who's accusing me.
Yes, of course. This observant chap here says he saw you take them before we left Portsmouth.
Well, he saw wrong, sir.
Or else he's a bloody liar.
- Are you a bloody liar? Answer freely.
- No, sir.
I saw him take them those two cheeses with me own eyes.
Mr. Christian, testing one man's word against another's is an empty procedure.
List the shortage as unsolved theft and stop the men's cheese ration
- until the deficit is made up.
- As you say, sir.
- Well, that'll be all, Mills.
- Thank you, sir.
Was there something further you wished to discuss?
Early Renaissance sketching, perhaps?
No, sir. Sorry, sir.
Let it lay, whatever it is. Let it lay.
- I got a little score to settle.
- Look, son, this is a small ship.
Fill it with grudges and there'd be no room left to live in.
And you're listening to 30 years at sea.
You don't preach to me, McCoy, and I won't preach to you. All right?
It's a good bargain, with you the loser.
You can thank your good friend Mills for this.
Now, this is the way it's gonna be.
Captain's orders.
There'll be no cheese issue until the shortage is made up.
You understand? And you?
So we've got a bootlicker onboard, eh?
A troublemaker.
- It wasn't my fault.
- Hey, what's the matter?
I don't like to be called a thief, that's all.
- A thief?
- A thief, that's right.
I'll teach you a lesson.
- Squealing on the boys.
- Hey!
I like a bit of cheese with my grub.
Maybe it's you who should take the licking.
Now look here.
It was the Captain asked me take the cheeses to his home, as a favor.
It's always the same in this blasted navy.
You do a job for an officer like that, you're called a thief.
And the crew lose their cheeses.
- So, you did the Captain a favor, eh?
- It was the Captain.
The Captain helping himself to the ship's stores.
- Hey.
- The Captain's the thief, not me!
The Articles of War provide most adequately for a man who calls his Captain a thief.
I think a few weeks without grog will teach him to hold his tongue.
No. Two dozen with the lash will teach him better still.
All hands to witness punishment.
Mr. Christian, if you please.
"If any officer, mariner or soldier, in or belonging to the fleet,
"shall behave himself with contempt to his superior officer,
"such superior officer being in the execution of his office,
"he shall be punished according to the nature of his offense."
Two dozen lashes.
Ship's company, on hats.
You just remember, it ain't me that's whipping you.
Don't worry, I'll live.
You know, mate, it ain't me. Remember.
Stop worrying. You're making me nervous.
Lay on, Quintal.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
- Six.
- You're going too lightly, Quintal.
Lay on with a will or you'll take his place.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Eleven.
Twelve.
You were ordered to witness punishment.
You can't turn away.
Thirteen.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Nineteen.
Twenty.
Twenty-one.
Twenty-two.
Twenty-three.
Twenty-four.
Company dismissed!
Lay away lee braces!
You are not eating, Mr. Young.
- With your permission, I'm not hungry, sir.
- Permission denied.
We'll not have food wasted.
- Eat your supper.
- Aye, sir.
Not a very sociable group tonight.
As a matter of fact, sir,
I was about to make a remark when you spoke.
You're pardoned.
Something troubling you, Mr. Christian?
No, sir. It's nothing. I just...
Well, I don't feel my cheeriest after watching a man take a severe lashing.
Pass Mr. Young the potatoes, please.
You've witnessed punishment before, surely.
Go ahead, speak your mind.
Well, sir, since you ask, it's...
It's the question of degree that troubles me.
You see, if one flogs a man half to death for a minor infraction, then how does one punish him for a serious offense?
Minor infraction, you said?
Yes. I think that two cheeses, sir...
Plus the word "thief" applied to his Captain.
But you still feel, though, that stopping the man's grog was sufficient punishment?
Well, I agree with you.
- You agree?
- Eat it up. Excellent stew.
If we were concerned with only the one case, certainly.
- Well, I don't know...
- Hear me.
You will, all of you, no doubt command your own ships some day.
Let us suppose that your vessel is running in heavy seas.
The shrouds are covered with ice.
A gale is blowing.
It becomes necessary, in your opinion, to order a seaman aloft.
He realizes, of course, that if his fingers slip from the icy shrouds for a split second, he'll perish immediately.
Now, this is a typical seaman, a half-witted, wife-beating, habitual drunkard.
His whole life is spent evading and defying authority.
Tell me, sir.
What is it that makes this man go aloft?
I think, depending on the man, sir, any number of things.
You can put it in one word. Fear.
Fear of what you'll do to him.
Fear of punishment so vivid in his mind that he fears it even more than sudden death.
Now don't mistake me.
I'm not advising cruelty or brutality with no purpose.
My point is that cruelty with purpose is not cruelty.
It's efficiency.
But a man will never disobey you once he's watched his mate's backbone laid bare.
He'll remember those white ribs staring at him, he'll see the flesh jump and hear the whistle of the whip for the rest of his life.
Well, perhaps you're right, sir.
I'd be careful of that cheese if I were you, sir.
It has a peculiar smell.
I think it's a bit tainted.
But then, of course, it's a question of individual taste.
It's damn good port.
In the following weeks,
Captain Bligh worked the ship
for every furlong of gain it could give.
Every inch of canvas spread,
and God help the helmsman
if the wake were not arrow-straight.
Captain Bligh must've asked me
the same question a score of times.
"What day saw the beginning
of the breadfruit's dormant period?"
I told him repeatedly,
I could not name the exact date
for lack of knowing it.
It became clear he'd begun to worry
lest we arrive too late.
He studied his charts hour on hour,
I could not imagine why.
I'd been told there was only one way
to get to the other side of the world.
The long way,
around the Cape of Good Hope
at the bottom of Africa.
That was the course with favoring winds.
As for the other route,
the westward passage around the Horn,
while arithmetic said "yes" to that,
weather said "no."
May I share your merriment?
Just a pleasantry, sir. It was nothing.
Mayn't I be included?
Well, it was just the way you were walking, sir.
It reminded me of a mutual friend,
Lord Folkestone.
- Do continue.
- Well, that's all, sir.
What was the resemblance?
Well, you just both have this distinctive walk, sir.
Really? In what way distinctive?
Well, he was kicked by a horse, sir.
I'd rather not say where, sir.
It had the effect of making him walk most oddly.
Poor fellow.
I see.
You may make yourself comfortable at the masthead, Mr. Young.
Please remain there until I summon you.
Aye, sir.
Don't repeat that mistake, Mr. Christian.
I'm not a figure of fun.
Indeed, you're not, sir.
- Make the course south southwest, please.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Bos'n's mate!
- Did you say south southwest, sir?
- I did.
- Lee braces!
- Lee braces it is, sir!
- Down helm.
- Down helm, sir!
- Hold her steady south southwest.
- South southwest, sir.
- Take away those weather sheets!
- Aye, aye, sir.
Going around the Horn will take five months off our journey.
Well, we shall have ourselves quite a little adventure.
What amuses you now?
I was just thinking, sir, that our little errand for groceries might wind up in a page of naval history.
If we succeed in negotiating the Horn in the dead of winter.
Why shouldn't we succeed?
Admiral Anderson did.
Yes, but of course he didn't choose to attempt it in a 91-foot chamber pot.
In any event, his was the only ship to do it, and I believe he lost 50 percent of his crew.
You might point that out to the crew.
It should improve their performance.
Remember, fear is our best weapon.
Good night, sir.
- When should I recall Mr. Young, sir?
- When I come on deck in the morning.
I want to see how comically he walks.
Poor fellow.
But, perhaps, in the morning, sir, he won't be able to walk at all.
Perhaps.
Good night, sir.
Good fellow.
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we really making for the Horn?
Yes, evidently.
May Heaven protect us.
I was in Admiral Anderson's ship, sir.
Were you, really?
Did you find it interesting?
Interesting, sir?
It was like riding a cork over a waterfall, sir.
And wind is not the name for what blows in your face.
It's something made of iron, swings at you from the west, never changing, day in and day out.
With seas as high as the mainmast.
We had lifelines rigged everywhere, sir, and there were still 16 men washed overboard.
Cold?
Three men froze in the yards.
Frozen stiff, sir.
Couldn't get them down without cutting their fingers loose from the shrouds.
I was lucky.
Well, that's the Horn for you, sir.
A delightful passage.
Good morning, sir.
And good morning to you, Ned.
Did you sleep well?
- My hands, I can't move them at all.
- Steady.
Easy, Ned.
- There's no feeling in them, Fletcher.
- Easy, Ned. Easy, Ned.
None at all.
Can't you understand? Absolute...
You're being undignified.
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.
Come along.
I don't think I can walk very well, Fletcher.
Well, don't be self-conscious.
We shall probably all walk like Lord Folkestone before this voyage is over.
There you are.
Very good, Ned. Very good.
She's straining badly, sir.
Yes, I'll have the t'gallants off of her,
Mr. Morrison.
Watch on deck, t'gallants fore line!
Bos'n's mate, call all hands!
All hands on deck!
Step lively, now. Come on.
Jump to it!
Try again...
Come on, let's get on with it!
We don't want be here if this stick breaks!
I think that's better, sir.
I have seen this storm.
Afraid of a little weather, Mr. Christian?
Set the t'gallants again.
But, you see, sir, the masts are straining, sir.
- You arguing with me?
- By no means, sir.
I was simply answering your question.
- Mr. Morrison, set the t'gallants again!
- Aye, sir!
All right, you men.
Up aloft and set the t'gallants again.
Any excuse to retard our progress, eh,
Mr. Christian?
But you wrong me, sir, if you believe that
I would willfully obstruct our progress.
Come now, why don't you admit you wouldn't lift a finger to speed it?
But that's absurd, sir.
Why should I not wish to do my best?
Because you are the sort of self-styled gentleman who thinks only one thought.
You feel only one emotion, contempt.
Contempt for effort, for ambition, for anyone born less fortunate than yourself.
You are poisoned with contempt,
Mr. Christian, and it makes you useless to me.
But I assure you, sir, that the execution of my duties is entirely unaffected by my private opinion of you.
Be certain of that, Mr. Christian.
Be most entirely certain.
Land ho!
Land ho!
Prepare the ship for heavy weather, if you please.
Aye, aye, sir.
Bos'n, prepare the ship for heavy weather!
Aye, aye, sir!
Ahoy, below!
Breakers dead ahead!
They ain't no breakers. They're combers.
Two oceans meeting head on.
Lend a hand, Norman.
Captain's orders to wear ship,
Mr. Christian!
- Do so!
- Aye, aye, sir!
All hands on deck! Come on!
Come on, come on. All hands lay aloft!
We've only just come below.
Listen here, what's he think he's doing?
Come on, come on!
The forward storeroom, sir!
A barrel has broken loose.
- Take over, Mr. Fryer!
- Aye, aye, sir!
Up helm!
Up helm!
Quickly there. Move!
Mills, Norman, Bennet...
Watch it!
Bennet!
Wait a moment. Go tell Mr. Fryer to let her run before the wind.
Right!
We've got to get a lash on it.
- Mr. Fryer, sir.
- What is it, Mills?
Mr. Christian said, let her run before the wind.
Before the wind?
We can't lash the barrels until she steadies.
- All right, go below.
- Right you are, sir.
- Midships to helm!
- Midships to helm!
Quintal, stand away.
Now hold off till she steadies.
Hold her steady before the wind!
All right, she's steady.
Norman, Quintal, get a lash on that cask.
Pass me a line!
What the hell are you doing, Mr. Fryer?
Mr. Christian's orders, sir.
Barrel broke loose...
- Put the helm over instantly!
- But Mr. Christian's below, sir,
- with a work party.
- Put the helm over!
- Down with helm.
- Down with helm, it is, sir.
Idiots!
Secure those barrels.
Easy now, easy.
Careful.
Gently now.
Move him carefully.
I'll get the medicine chest.
- He's dead.
- Mr. Christian!
Mr. Christian!
Are you deaf as well as irresponsible?
I demand an explanation.
I thought she was holding steadily enough, sir.
I ordered Norman under a water cask...
Never mind Norman. Answer me.
Never mind Norman, sir?
There was no justification in your ordering the ship hove to.
We lost a full league before I could countermand your order, one full league!
- You countermanded my order, sir?
- Now, you heed me well, Mr. Christian.
We are embarked upon a King's mission.
Any further attempt at sabotage and I will deal with you as a traitor.
When you countermanded that order, sir, you crushed the life out of Thomas Norman.
I suppose you would halt the ship again for his burial service.
Since we are not at war, sir,
I would hope to give him a decent burial.
Yes, sir.
I am at war.
Against ill winds, contrary currents and incompetent officers.
You'd best join my war, Mr. Christian, for if I don't start winning soon, the casualty list will be real enough.
Aye, aye, sir!
I make our position here by dead reckoning.
If that's right, sir, another three weeks will see us through.
We'll get through.
The pumps holding their own?
- Aye, sir.
- Good.
We'll go on the other tack now.
Tack ship, if you please.
Aye, aye, sir.
All hands on deck!
Tack ship! Come on, Williams, up top!
- Gently, gently.
- Get up, the Horn waits for no man.
He'll drown the lot of us.
I know the way that man's mind works.
- I felt it on my back.
- Stop your grousing.
Portsmouth or Cape Horn, it's all one to a seaman.
Well, it can't stay overcast forever, sir.
Four weeks blind tacking is forever,
Mr. Fryer, and you know it!
Other tack, wear ship!
Downwind in this weather, sir, is very dangerous.
We have no choice!
- Weather braces!
- Aye, aye, sir!
Starboard watch on deck!
Starboard watch on deck!
All hands on deck!
What's the matter?
Up helm!
Steer two points to starboard!
Be ready to reverse your helm!
Lay away lee braces! All the way!
All the way weather braces!
We're back where we started four weeks ago!
Bad news, sir.
Your cabin's completely awash.
The pumps are barely able to hold their own, sir.
We've lost, Mr. Fryer.
- Make way for the Cape of Good Hope.
- Aye, aye, sir!
Lay away lee braces!
Downward off the mizzen.
Here, here, here. What's all this, then?
That, old son, is half a ration of meat.
- What do you mean half a ration?
- Captain's orders.
Orders! You dish up a full plate of that or I'll cut your curls off.
I don't make the rules, I just dish the stuff.
That's all you're gonna get, you'd better take it.
He's right.
Half-rations are better than none at all.
- Why half-rations? What for?
- Make up time, I suppose.
Well, starving a man doesn't make the ship go no faster.
It saves stopping for stores, doesn't it?
Oh, so to catch up a couple of weeks, we starve all the way to Tahiti, eh?
I'll tell you one thing, it's against the regulations.
Regulations?
If we can be flogged by the regulations, we can be fed by them.
Good. You convinced me.
Now, go and convince the Captain.
All right.
Anybody coming along with me?
- To see the Captain?
- That's right, the Captain.
You sure it's regulation?
How do you know?
Because I read them.
A sailor with an education, like a singing pig.
All right, I'm with you.
What are you men doing in these quarters?
I brought them, sir.
They wish to state a complaint.
Let them do so.
Speak up.
I'm begging your pardon, sir.
We're sorry to disturb you, sir.
If this isn't a good moment, sir, why, this is nothing that won't...
That won't keep a while, sir.
No, no, no. Please continue.
I'm always available to hear complaints.
Well, Captain, sir, we've...
We've come representing the whole crew.
It's about the half-rations, sir.
And they ain't right, sir.
I'd like to...
The crew would like to remind you, sir, what it says in the regulations.
You dare to quote the regulations to me?
The regulations was made to go by, sir.
We don't mean no impertinence, sir.
But right is right, sir.
Five full months you've cost me, you fumbling idlers.
Us? How, sir? What did we do?
This commission gave every man in the ship's company the key to opportunity, the chance to show what he's made of.
Well, you've shown what you're made of.
Dirt and empty silk nightcaps.
Well, I thought I heard your voice, sir.
Good night.
So you want full rations, do you?
Well, I'll give you all the rations you need to get us to Tahiti in time.
Now get out!
"All the rations you need
to get us to Tahiti on time. "
Those were Captain Bligh's words.
Rations of what, he didn't say.
But he soon showed us.
Rations of
his favorite commodity, punishment.
Served up to the tune
of his favorite music,
a cry of pain, a scream of agony.
That was the concert that played us
across three oceans
as the months vanished from the calendar.
And Captain Bligh's tension increased.
Three.
Come down on deck, you clumsy lubbers!
And that jib, hoist it taut.
Land ho!
Land ho!
This island is inhabited by over 200,000 savages.
Eleven years ago, when I was here with Captain Cook, they were not dangerous.
However, the natives of the Sandwich Islands seemed friendly enough, but without warning, they turned on Captain Cook and killed him.
We shall take all due military precautions.
In the event we find ourselves welcome, you will discover that these savages have absolutely no conception of ordinary morality.
And you will, no doubt, take full advantage of their ignorance.
It is a matter of supernatural indifference to me whether you contaminate the natives or the natives contaminate you.
I have but one concern, our mission.
Let any one of you provoke an incident which endangers it, and I shall cause that man to curse his mother for giving him birth.
Lee braces, Mr. Christian.
Stand by the anchor!
Let off.
Hoist out the launch. I shall want 12 men.
- Aye, aye.
- Mr. Fryer, give them muskets.
And arm another six men and put them in the cutter.
At the first sign of treachery, you will open fire
- and help us to retreat.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Select a work detail before you go ashore.
Advise Mr. Christian.
If our reception is friendly, start gathering the plants right away.
One plant will be enough to tell the story, sir, but I shall have to find a specimen that has sprouted from the root.
- Then instruct your men accordingly.
- Very good, sir.
No, not as a walking stick, Brown.
Bring the cutter in closer.
King George?
No, Your Excellency.
But King George ordered me to pay his compliments to King Hitihiti.
I talk you talk. I go Captain Cook.
Visit many islands.
You Mr. Bligh. Me Minarii.
I know, I remember you well.
Our island pilot, and a fine one.
Oh, yes, very wonderful.
Will you please tell King Hitihiti that King George sends many tokens of friendship?
Hitihiti say, what he have,
King George want.
This is what we have come for,
Your Excellency, breadfruit.
That's right, uru.
King George wants his people to be as strong as your people.
He wants your breadfruit to nourish them.
Hitihiti say take all breadfruit you want.
You are most grateful, Your Excellency.
Thank you.
Here you are, Brownie. This is one, isn't it?
No, no. Nothing like it.
Brown, is that it over there?
Right you are, sir.
Right you are.
Artocarpus incisa.
Isn't it amazing?
Such a delicate sprig with the power to feed a continent.
You know, there's evidence to prove that a diet of breadfruit can sustain life all by itself.
Whose life? Not mine.
Lay on, Mills.
Watch your toes there.
They're like a string of live pearls.
- It must be some sort of game.
- Women only!
- Damn dull game.
- Oh, it has its possibilities.
Not a single man among them.
How many women do you suppose are down there?
Enough.
Here! Do you think we need to tell the others?
Look at those, fellows.
They're flogging the water.
- What they do?
- Chase fish for feast.
You like go?
Go ask him. Go on.
I'll ask him.
- There. Now, you see the new roots.
- I beg your pardon, sir.
Almost like little veins, aren't they, stretching down into the earth?
- Would you just... For a moment, sir.
- What?
What is it, Mills?
It's a debatable point.
Some favor the longer, some the shorter.
They're fishing, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir, but seeing them down there, working their fingers to the bones, well, we thought, that is, the lads and I thought, that we might just, well, nip along and give them a little hand, sir.
Something to talk about when we get home, sir.
Yes, sir, considering our mission, sir.
Well, can we give them a hand, sir?
Yes, I think we should all give them a hand.
Mr. Christian, I'm ready for a man to help me ball the root.
- To what?
- Ball the root.
Well...
- Mills?
- Gosh, sir, I...
I don't know a thing about gardening, sir.
Honest, I don't.
Well, go on, then!
Thank you, sir.
- I'm ready, Mr. Christian.
- Oh, damn you, Brown! I'm coming.
Mates! Hey, mates. What's that?
Don't be scared.
I'm going to take you home with me.
- Well, is it dormant, or isn't it?
- I couldn't say, sir.
Only the transplant itself can answer you, by living or dying.
And when can I expect its decision?
Perhaps 12 hours, perhaps three weeks, sir.
Excellent. You can't say yet.
Perhaps 12 hours, perhaps three weeks.
We've traveled a gardener 29,000 miles to be told we don't even know the condition of the breadfruit. Excellent!
You know, I heard that if that bread plant dries up, we could be here four or five months.
- You better pray it don't, mate.
- Pray it don't? What do you mean?
How did you like your voyage out here, then?
Nice? Comfortable?
Nothing but fair and proper treatment from the Captain, eh?
Worst I ever remember.
Well, what makes you want to get underway, then?
Use your head.
If Captain Bligh was cooped up here for five months, five months, mark you, who do you think he'd take it out on?
You think we sweat a bit, making for the Horn?
Wait till he breaks our back making for Jamaica.
We'll worry about that when it comes. Here!
- Aye.
- Might as well at that, mates.
I wonder why they make those women eat alone?
Because if they didn't, you'd be too busy to eat.
Funny lot, aren't they?
They let us make free with their women.
They won't let us eat with them.
Isn't that like knocking at the wrong door?
Hitihiti say,
Captain dance with daughter now.
Dance? No, not me.
I thank Your Excellency, but I don't dance.
No say no. Hitihiti angry.
My apologies, Your Excellency.
I did not understand.
- You are amused?
- No, I hope I shall not be, sir.
But it does seem a rather difficult dance, doesn't it?
We shall see.
Sorry to spoil your evening, sir, but you said you wished to be informed of any development.
It looks wilted, Brown.
It's dead, sir.
Might there not be other plants that will flourish?
Sir, this proves that the dormant season has begun.
Well, you did the best you could, sir.
It's a pity the Admiralty will blame you, in any case, for the delay.
But, it's an unjust world. My sympathy!
I dislike failure.
I dislike it as much as the Admiralty does.
Forgive me. I have a partner over there.
Forgive me, please.
It was in that time of year called Indian summer,
That season when the Canadian wilderness...
Is touched with
Autumn's mystery.
It's a time when change is in the air,
When migration is in the blood...
And the homing instinct is strong in the heart.
It's a time of busy comings and goings,
Of constant commotion and unexplained restlessness.
Yet, as each day ends, nature sleeps again,
And the night brings a peaceful calm.
It was in this uncertain season,
In this same wild section of Canada,
That this story had its beginnings.
One evening, a man named John Longridge...
Was passing the time with some old friends.
They were good company, these three.
For a bachelor, almost like having a family around.
Washing will be done on the floor.
Yet, things weren't as perfect as they seemed.
It so happened, this wasn't the animals' true home.
And this man, for all his hospitality and kindness,
Wasn't their real master.
And that accounted for the lonely look...
In the young retriever's eyes.
Hello.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.
Mrs. Oakes?
Yes, it's me, Mr. Longridge.
Can you hear me?
I hear you.
I wanted to know what time you'd be leaving in the morning.
About seven.
Trouble is,
I can't make it by then.
Sorry, Mrs. Oakes,
I've lost you again.
I think it's somebody else on the line.
If that's you, Winifred, you get off this minute.
Do you hear me?
Winifred?
- You're still there.
- I can tell.
What I was trying to tell you, Mr. Longridge,
I can't get there until nine o'clock.
That's quite all right.
You're sure now?
Nine o'clock...
Is all right?
Of course, and before you get here I'll take...
The 2 dogs and the cat...
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Mr. Longridge?
The joys of living in the country.
Well, that was your friend,
Mrs. Oakes.
Now, how about a run?
Come on, you two.
For a man who'd never kept pets,
Longridge had learned the ropes quickly.
He knew the animals expected and enjoyed...
Their nightly romp outdoors.
He'd learned not to worry about them.
They'd be back in their own good time.
"Dear Mrs. Oakes,
"we are out of coffee.
"Please order more.
"I'll be taking dogs...
"and Tao, too, of course,
"out for a morning run...
"before I leave.
"Don't worry yourself too much over them.
I know they will be fine."
No bears out tonight?
Rabbits? Skunks?
No other cats?
Come on, Luath.
You're letting in the cold.
At bedtime every night,
The retriever liked to get off by himself,
So he slept in the kitchen.
The comfort-loving Siamese chose the hearth...
In front of the fire.
But the bull terrier wouldn't settle for anything less...
Than the master bedroom.
Old Bodger had his own basket, his own blanket,
And his own sly plans.
The moment the man dropped off to sleep,
The dog would sneak out of his own bed...
And then climb into the big one.
He practically never missed his chance.
But tonight for some reason, the man stayed awake.
He was calling to mind again,
How he'd come to have
3 remarkable animals...
Belonging to somebody else.
It was one weekend at professor Hunter's house.
The Hunters were his closest friends.
He was godfather to the daughter,
And sort of an unofficial uncle to the son.
This, somehow, gave him a special interest in their pets.
Come on, Bodger, jump!
Get the ball!
On this Sunday, as usual, he was invited to dinner,
And this happened to be the day the exciting telegram came.
I've been offered a visiting fellowship at Oxford.
Here's what they say.
"A series of 12 lectures.
Lodging for family available.
Hope you will accept."
It's wonderful news!
You are going to accept?
Well, it does mean a lot to my career...
And Nancy's willing.
Nancy was more than willing.
In fact, everybody was thrilled,
And in their excitement had forgotten something important.
What will we do about Tao while we're away?
Hey, that's right.
What about Bodger?
I must confess, this is a problem I'd overlooked.
Don't worry, we'll find a good kennel and board them out.
But mother, not Tao.
You know how he hates to be cooped up.
he wouldn't be that cooped up.
He'd be with other cats.
but he hates other cats.
might do him good.
Sometimes, I think, he thinks he's a dog.
Well, suppose we settle this later.
No need to bother John with the problem.
Ah, but I have the answer.
There I am rattling around that big house of mine, right?
I know the animals.
The animals know me.
So there's no need to board them out.
They will stay with me.
About the time everyone else was in bed,
It was the cat's habit to wake up and go prowling.
A shadow, a moth, a beam of moonlight,
His curiosity took him everywhere.
On this particular night, his exploring...
Would sort of miscarry.
Without his knowing it, he had opened the door...
For the incredible journey.
Next morning, as he'd planned,
John Longridge got off to an early start.
For as long as he could remember,
He'd never missed the opening day of duck season.
Here it was, that time of year again.
Luath,
Young fella,
You'd like to come along, but I'm afraid it wouldn't do.
You couldn't leave your friends,
Now, could you?
Why, Luath.
This is the first time.
You charmer, you.
Well, young fella, you're the steady one,
So you'll look after the other two.
Won't you?
Au revoir.
Now, the animals were alone,
And for all they knew, completely deserted.
Silence fell upon the scene,
Silence that seemed to stretch away to the ends of the earth.
Then voices spoke.
Wild geese called,
Wild geese going home.
Somehow, this was an urge the young dog could understand.
For in him, the homing instinct was strong, too.
Among these three, the bond of friendship was binding.
Wherever one would go, the others would follow.
So it was,
The animals set out for home.
They couldn't know it was 200 miles away.
They only knew that it was somewhere off to the west,
So they would follow the sun.
The incredible journey had begun.
That's funny.
I don't see the animals.
They're always out to welcome us.
Probably Mr. Longridge left them inside...
Knowing you was coming.
I s'pose so.
Bring the vacuum cleaner,
Will ya, Bert?
Now, where do you s'pose they've gone to?
Bodger, Luath?
Where could those rascals be?
Probably gone up to the school.
There's no note at all.
He goes up there sometimes to play with the kids.
Where's the cat?
He wouldn't go up there.
Luath, Tao?
Here puss, puss, puss.
Bodger?
Here, boy.
Here, boy!
Luath? Tao?
Bodger?
They're not outside.
Probably hunting.
The cat, maybe. I never saw such an animal for hunting.
But the dogs, they wouldn't go off.
Quit stewing.
They'll show up.
Where do you want this plugged in?
Right there, in front of your nose.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Here's a note from
Mr. Longridge, after all.
That's funny.
"I'll be taking the dogs and Tao too, of course."
Now what do you s'pose he means by that?
Just what it says.
He's got the animals.
Why didn't he say so on the phone?
Don't ask me.
Wait a minute.
I remember now.
Last night when the phone went dead,
Mr. Longridge was just about to tell me something.
Then, don't worry. He's got the dogs and the cat, too.
You've got nothing to fuss about.
Well, all I can say is that...
It sure beats me how some people can change their minds.
As it turned out, not a single person concerned...
Would know of the secret departure.
By this time, the animals were well on their way.
From the very start,
The travelers had adopted a certain marching order.
The young dog became the natural leader,
For he was the one driven by the desire to get home.
The old dog was more of a follower,
Quite satisfied to let someone else show the way.
He wasn't too sure he could make it,
But he'd try for his friends' sake.
The cat, meanwhile, was everywhere;
Sometimes in front, sometimes far behind,
Sometimes off on side trips of his own.
As the little procession went along,
The dogs were the dedicated ones,
And the cat the happy-go-lucky one...
Ready for anything, especially hunting.
Along about mid-afternoon of that first day,
The animals were getting a little tired...
And beginning to feel the effects of their long walk.
They put their heads together a moment,
And even the ambitious young leader seemed to agree...
It was time to stop.
When he'd had his fill, the retriever led off again.
He took it for granted that the rest periods would be short,
That they'd immediately push on.
It seemed, though,
That his partners weren't of the same mind.
Old Bodger's feet hurt.
The truth of the matter was,
This was almost too much for an old dog...
No longer in his prime.
The others would just have to wait while he took a moment out.
The cat was agreeable.
Especially since he'd stumbled onto something...
Well worth waiting around for.
Car coming!
Might be someone who would recognize them, and this was...
The last thing they wanted.
The scare over, it was time to get going again.
If the old terrier had been alone at this moment,
He probably wouldn't have bothered.
He was stiff in every joint, and definitely feeling his years.
Much more of this and he'd be through.
By morning of the second day,
Bodger was definitely beginning to slow down.
It was becoming more and more apparent...
He'd soon have to rest.
But the young leader couldn't bring himself to stop,
Not this early in the game,
And he kept urging his friends to push on.
As the leader,
It was the retriever's job to choose the way.
He seemed to have an uncanny knack...
Of always knowing where west was.
So far as he was concerned,
There'd be no such thing as obstacles.
He would keep going in a straight line.
It was up to the others to follow.
For Bodger, it wasn't quite that simple.
His sore feet were beginning to give him real trouble,
And his pace was getting slower and slower.
Many miles farther on,
Near mid-afternoon of the second day,
The weary old terrier had just about reached his limit.
The collapse, when it came, was total.
His legs simply folded up under him.
The young dog hated to stop, yet he knew he had to.
He couldn't leave his friend.
There was nothing else to do...
But wait until Bodger could get his second wind.
And if possible, somewhere, somehow, something to eat.
In fact, all of them were getting hungry,
And before much longer,
Would need something more to go on, than water.
If food was to be found,
It was likely the cat would be the first to find it.
Suddenly, the chance popped up right in front of him.
Old Bodger stayed put, glad for the chance to rest.
As yet, he wasn't aware that he was a celebrity of sorts.
Somehow the news had got around about him,
And now the curious came to look him over.
These two decided not to be standoffish about it,
But to give him their greeting in person.
Bodger, perhaps,
Could have done with a little less of the personal touch,
But he was much too tired to object.
Pretty soon the cubs had had enough, too.
To their way of thinking,
This dull stranger wasn't much for fun.
In another moment,
They'd invented a game with a lot more action in it,
Action...
And noise.
From a distance, it sounded like a really vicious fight.
Alarming enough to raise a mother's fears,
And make her come a runnin'.
Thoroughly aroused,
The she-bear needed a target.
Somebody'd been hurtin' her cubs,
And somebody would have to suffer the consequences.
It had been a near thing for Bodger,
Weak as he was and almost helpless.
But now the cat would cheer him up.
He would bring the meal so badly needed.
Within a few minutes...
The old dog was quite himself again,
Revived and refreshed, and ready for the road.
By the end of the first week,
The animals had learned to travel after sundown.
For then, they stood less chance of being seen.
Generally, they steered around settlements,
But one night they decided to break their rule.
An old sawmill looked deserted enough to risk it,
And they chose the shortcut.
Everything went along all right...
Until Bodger got wind of the cook house.
Being shot at was something new for the old terrier.
It sort of shook his faith in human nature.
But worse than that,
It made him look foolish in front of his friends.
He could sense it in their accusing looks.
After 10 days on the trail,
The animals were weak with hunger,
And had begun to get discouraged.
Even the determined young leader.
By now,
They were ready to stalk any wild game they could find.
The cat, of course, was a natural hunter,
But the dogs were ready to try, too,
Though neither of them was a true hunting breed.
Chasing rabbits was a bit strenuous for the old terrier,
And instead, he rested.
Then, suddenly, he heard singing.
It was old Jeremy, the hermit,
Recluse, and philosopher.
Slightly odd, people said,
But kindly, and very friendly to animals.
Oh, ho!
Good day to you.
Old Jeremy lived close to nature...
In a world of his own.
His friends, the wild creatures of the forest.
Instinctively,
Bodger felt this was a man who might help them.
When the retriever returned and fell in step,
He was sort of lukewarm about it.
This was all against his better judgment.
He wasn't sure...
They wanted to get mixed-up with people.
At the hermit's cabin the young dog hung back,
Still not convinced this was a good idea.
Come in, my dear, around this way.
Presently, Maud, presently.
It was the appetizing smell of the stew...
That finally won the dog over.
However, he would put his rabbit...
Where he could find it later.
Oh, come in, old chap.
Glad to have you aboard.
So the retriever joined his friends,
Prepared to accept the old man's hospitality.
Now, their host went about setting the table.
From long habit, he got out only one plate.
But wait,
Today there would be places for 3 more.
Oh, Maud, you must learn to control yourself.
At last, the half-starved animals...
Were about to enjoy a home-cooked meal.
How lucky that Bodger had spied this friendly old hermit,
And how kind of him to bring them to his bountiful table.
For what we are about to receive,
May the lord make us truly thankful. Amen.
Do sit down.
At the familiar command, the animals sat...
On the floor,
Where most pets have been trained to sit.
All except cats.
Cats, of course, will sit where they please.
Oh, not hungry?
Oh, picky.
His own plate finished,
The old man moved to the next chair and the next serving.
Since no one was eating it,
This seemed the most logical thing to do.
Gradually, it began to dawn on the dogs...
That they might be about to lose out on a good thing.
The last chair, the last plate,
Their last chance.
In the end, it was the crow...
That roused the old man from his daydreaming.
Oh, Maud,
Time for our nap, is it?
Good-bye, old chap.
Nice you could come to dine.
Remember me most kindly to your mother.
Disappointed, but too polite to show it,
The animals carried out their part of the make-believe,
And took themselves off,
Like the well-behaved guests they were.
Delightful people, eh, Maud?
We must have them over again very soon.
Yes.
As it worked out, their luck wasn't all bad.
This rabbit wasn't make-believe,
So they wouldn't starve.
It was to be expected that the wilderness, itself,
Would give them a problem or two.
Now they had one.
At moments like this,
The retriever had a decided advantage over his friends.
For him, being an out-and-out water dog,
Crossing a river was nothing.
In fact, he sort of enjoyed a nice swim.
The bull terrier didn't take to it quite so naturally.
Still, once he got over his fear,
He turned out to be...
A pretty good water dog, too.
But when it came the cat's turn, it was a different proposition.
For the first time on the trip,
He got his back up.
He wouldn't even dip his toe in.
He could face a bear, maybe,
But he couldn't bring himself to face a river.
This was asking too much.
As it turned out,
The cat wouldn't have to get his feet wet, after all.
There was a bridge the beavers had built.
It had a stick or two missing,
But not so much but what the cat couldn't jump over.
He'd crossed many a creek wider than this,
And the dogs were confident he could do it.
The cat was gone, no two ways about it.
Their friend had disappeared.
Instinctively, the dogs knew a sense of loss.
They missed their partner, missed him very much.
They tried to console each other in their common sorrow.
For hours afterward, they stood by...
Refusing to leave.
They seemed to feel that somehow, by hook or crook,
The clever cat would find a way to get back.
If they'd stay just a little longer,
They'd see him comin' along...
As sleek and spry as ever.
But it was a forlorn hope,
And finally, they seemed to understand that.
Now they'd have to forget their best friend and provider,
And push on, just the two of them.
Miles downstream, pure chance would play a part in things.
For in the cat's moment of greatest need,
A helping hand happened to be near.
Papa!
Come and see.
There's a funny looking animal.
See, papa?
Is it a weasel?
No, I don't think so.
No, it's a cat.
Or...
It was a cat.
It's moving.
It's still alive.
Poor thing.
What can we do?
I don't know.
Helvi, you run and get a dry towel,
And I'll heat some milk.
Put some brandy in it, too.
Be careful.
Don't squeeze too hard.
He swallowed half the river.
That poor thing won't need a drink for weeks.
Olga, see if he'll take a little milk and brandy.
Oh, look.
He's moving.
Keep him warm and quiet for awhile.
I've got chores to do.
Will he be all right, papa?
Maybe, maybe not.
Hard to tell just yet.
And so it was, that a half-starved cat...
And a lonely little girl struck up an acquaintance...
That brought comfort and companionship to both.
Good night, mama.
Sleep well.
You, too.
Papa, one little song...
For my cat?
♪ Ol kaunis kesa ilta ♪
♪ Kun laaksossa kavelin ♪
♪ Ol kaunis kesa ilta ♪
♪ Kun laaksossa kavelin ♪
♪ So tun tee Ni voitti ♪
♪ Ja hei tyi syommeni ♪
♪ So tun tee Ni voitti ♪
♪ Ja hei tyi syommeni ♪♪
Later that night, the cat came to the girl,
As though to tell her something.
He was trying to say good-bye.
Something out there was calling him,
And he knew what it was.
He knew he must find the 2 dogs.
Next morning, the cat located the place...
Where the dogs had waited,
And soon had picked up their trail.
Now that he was alone, he could travel...
At his own pace, in his own way,
His natural stealth his protection.
He was almost as much at home in the wilderness...
As the creatures of the wild themselves,
And often watched them pass...
Without their knowing he was anywhere near.
As he went deeper and deeper into the forest,
The cat began to get uneasy.
He had a strange feeling...
He was being followed.
There was nothing in sight,
Yet his senses told him there was something back there,
Something evil.
Evil it was, for it was the lynx,
A wild and wanton killer.
Suddenly, another hunter appeared.
Not as savage as the lynx, perhaps,
But equipped to deal out death, just the same.
When all seemed quiet, the cat went on.
Faster now, to make up for the time he'd lost.
One morning, not long after,
The dogs heard a peculiar call.
It was a cry to stop them in their tracks,
For it sounded like a Siamese cat.
The young dog let Bodger be the first to greet the cat.
He understood that there was...
Something special about this friendship.
Then both dogs offered the cat their affection.
They seemed to want to tell him how much they'd missed him.
Every step of the way, the animals had known hunger,
And by the end of the third week...
Were desperate for food.
By this time, they'd taught themselves...
To chase anything that moved.
Especially if it looked fat and easy to catch.
Now, a porcupine could only mean trouble,
But the dogs weren't experienced enough to know that.
the retriever was struck...
Before he quite knew what had happened.
Something else he didn't know...
Was that the sharp quills were barbed like fishhooks,
And would work their way in deeper.
Instinctively,
The retriever turned to his friends for help,
But Bodger, not knowing what to do,
Only succeeded in making things worse.
When the pain started,
The dog went to water to cool his burning face.
It wasn't a cure, but it was a relief.
It was the only thing he knew to do.
Every few hours,
He found it necessary to repeat the treatment.
And so it was, that he happened to be at a nearby lake...
When the first flight of mallards came in.
Surprised though he was, the hunter was interested, too,
For he could see that the retriever had been well trained.
He was James Mackenzie, fancier of fine hunting dogs...
And a man to admire one when he saw it.
Good dog!
Well done.
Now bring it to me.
Poor laddie.
You've got mixed-up with a porcupine someplace.
Where's your master?
Ahoy!
Or don't you have one?
Whose ever dog it was,
Mackenzie's mind was made up.
The animal must have immediate attention.
The retriever went along without protest.
He seemed to realize...
He needed help,
And must return to the world of humans to find it.
And so, the kindly man led the dog home.
He couldn't know there were others of the party around,
That he might even have touched one...
If he'd known he was there.
Nell, look what I found.
And look what I found.
Another one.
This poor dog's nearly starving.
Aye, so is this one.
Worse than that, he's hurt.
Hurt?
Porcupine quills.
You can see for yourself.
Will he let you touch him?
I think so.
That is if his partner, here, will let me.
Funny, how they seem to know each other.
It's more than that. I think they're traveling together.
Where do you suppose they came from?
I don't know.
Lost from a car traveling cross-country,
It's hard to say.
The main thing is...
This retriever needs help.
When did you find Whitey?
Oh, he found me.
I guess he smelled the bacon cooking.
He came to the door like an old hobo, begging,
And I really mean begging.
I heard this scratching, and there he was carrying on...
Just like he's doing now.
You old clown.
Now, laddie, hold still.
I know this hurts.
Unfortunately, it's got to be done.
There, there, laddie.
It's not as bad as all that.
See if you can get him on the porch.
How?
Food, food.
Your intentions are good, but you're getting in the way.
Shall I go out there with him?
No.
There, I'm through.
Let the other one in.
I can't get over the affection these two show.
Do you think we can find who they belong to?
When I drive into deepwater in the morning,
I'll inquire around, maybe put an ad in the paper.
Meanwhile,
The one person who should have been the first to know,
Would be the last to hear...
Of the events of the past several weeks.
Welcome back,
Mr. Longridge.
Thank you.
I've been watching out for you all morning.
This came the first of the week.
The hunter family...
Will be flying back the day after tomorrow. So I see.
Was it a good trip?
Yes, marvelous.
And the animals, did they have a good time?
The animals?
Why Bodger, and the cat and Luath.
You mean, all this time...
They haven't been with you?
Of course not. I left them here.
But they're not here!
I haven't seen them in 3 weeks.
3 weeks?
When I came, the morning you left,
The animals were nowhere in sight.
And then, I found this note,
Saying that you were taking them with you.
But this is only half of it!
That's all there was,
Mr. Longridge.
Do you suppose they could have been hit by a car?
Or poisoned?
Or stolen?
One of them, maybe,
But not all 3 together.
Yet, they couldn't just vanish.
The retriever,
I keep remembering the look in his eyes.
You know,
On the morning I left,
For the very first time, he offered me his paw.
Mrs. Oakes, they've gone home.
Home?
Home!
The retriever has taken them home.
He was the unhappy one,
So he's simply gone back home.
Someone would have seen them.
Not necessarily.
They wouldn't be where anyone would see them.
You see, traveling by instinct,
They'd simply go west,
Straight across country...
And over the Ironmouth Range.
Over the Ironmouth!
Then there's no use hoping anymore.
Don't let's fool ourselves.
You know old Bodger couldn't last more than 10 miles.
I wouldn't give much for the cat's chances, either.
Operator?
If they did make for home, there's a good chance...
That the big powerful dog, like the retriever,
Would get there.
But it's a long way,
Mr. Longridge.
Yes, I know.
Operator, would you please get me the chief ranger...
Of lands and forests up at the Ironmouth station?
Glad to,
Mr. Longridge.
I'll pass the word on to the game wardens tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
No trouble at all,
Mr. Longridge,
But the reporter that knows that area...
Is up at Windigo covering a plowing contest.
But he'll be in tomorrow, and I'll have him call you.
Yes, Mr. Longridge,
I have maintenance crews all through that country.
I'll be in touch with them in the morning.
Tomorrow, tomorrow.
I gotta know today.
How do you find a dog...
In 200 miles of backwoods country?
That same evening,
James Mackenzie was providing bed-and-board for his guests.
He'd decided to keep the dogs locked up until he could...
Inquire around and find out who they belonged to.
There you are, now.
Spend a quiet night.
The third member of the party,
Whose presence Mackenzie was still unaware of,
Had watched these goings-on with great interest.
He now knew where the dogs were.
He knew they were all alone.
This was his chance to join them.
Neither latch nor lock could keep him from his friends.
The worst thing is, we haven't got a single clue.
Hello.
Yes, this is John Longridge.
Yes!
Yes, that's right.
2 dogs and a Siamese cat.
It's the operator at Lintola.
She says a little girl rescued a Siamese cat.
Oh, it disappeared.
2 weeks ago.
Get me the map.
No sign of the dogs?
Well, thank you very much for calling.
Please let me know if you hear anything more.
Good night.
It's not much to go on,
But apparently the cat got as far as Lintola.
It's about 100 miles from here.
100 miles? There it is, right there.
Lintola.
How could the cat get that far,
And nobody's seen the dogs?
If it was our cat.
What could have happened to those dogs?
Poor old Bodger.
I don't think we're going to solve anything more tonight.
Come on, mother.
We'd better get home,
And let Mr. Longridge get some sleep.
He's gotta be on that plane in the morning.
Yes.
When the hunters get home,
I've got to be there.
That's the least I can do.
But I don't know how I'm going to face up to the children.
At sun-up the next morning,
The retriever was eager to be up and doing.
The old restlessness had returned.
It was time to press on.
For a moment,
His determination seemed to weaken.
He was grateful for the kind treatment he had received.
Yet, the homing call was stronger than gratitude,
And he knew he must answer it.
Ahead lay the Ironmouth Range,
Rugged, forbidding, and uninhabited.
Now, the animals were beyond all human help.
And worst of all,
A biting edge of cold could be felt in the air.
Already ice had begun to form in the stream.
Before many more days, the river's voice would be still,
And this land frozen under winter snows.
At the hunter's house, meanwhile,
The telephone had been kept busy day and night.
Thank you for calling.
Good night.
That's the best bet, yet.
A man named Mackenzie, who lives in Conrad,
Says he actually had the dogs only 3 days ago.
Had the dogs?
Yeah. He didn't know about the cat,
But the dogs answer our description.
Why didn't he keep them?
He must have known they belonged to somebody.
He did. He locked them in his barn,
But they managed to get away.
He figures they're headed through here.
Through the primitive area.
Then there's no hope.
There might be, Jim.
They made it this far.
It's only 40 miles more.
But 40 miles of what?
The worst kind of country!
Nancy, as you can guess,
I've regretted that day when I offered to take the animals.
Nonsense, John.
None of that.
It wasn't your fault.
Oh, sure.
But try to tell the youngsters that.
They'll get over it, in time.
Peter doesn't say much.
I think he knew from the beginning...
That an old dog wouldn't stand a chance.
I think he's accepted the fact that poor old Bodger's gone.
And Elizabeth?
Elizabeth's a strange one.
She's just the opposite.
Firmly convinced in her own mind...
That her cat's going to show up.
Just has faith that her old
Tao cat will come walking in...
As sassy and independent as ever.
The grownups wished they could share the child's belief,
But they knew it was too much to hope for.
It was better to forget what had happened...
And look forward to happier occasions.
♪ happy birthday, dear Peter ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪
Bravo!
Blow them out.
Did you make a wish?
I don't feel much like it, really.
Not the wish I'd like to wish.
Peter, I was going to wait until you opened your presents,
But I think this is the right time for you to have this.
Happy birthday.
What is it?
Registration papers from the Kenmore Kennels.
They're holding a puppy in your name.
Well, Peter.
Another bull terrier.
How nice of you, John.
What's his name?
He's properly named, as tradition says,
Starting with a "B."
Champion Birmingham...
Brigadier of Brocton.
What's his color?
White, of course.
And so much like Bodger,
I just couldn't believe it!
Peter, darling, can't you say thank you?
Thank you, Uncle John.
Suppose we serve the cake now, hmm?
Elizabeth, would you get the ice cream, please?
All right. Very nice of you, John.
Listen.
Listen, everybody!
What is it?
I hear a dog barking.
I don't hear anything.
I do.
Daddy, it's Luath!
Oh, Liz, please don't.
But I'm sure of it.
I know his bark.
I think I hear it, too,
Up on the hill.
It's probably just somebody out hunting.
You know, James, Luath might have been able to make it.
It could be Luath, dad.
Try calling him.
For a magic moment,
James Hunter was as a child again,
Hoping against hope.
It is!
It is Luath!
Look at him come!
Come on, Luath!
Come on, boy!
Good boy, Luath.
I can't believe it.
Luath!
In the general excitement, everything else was forgotten,
Peter, Bodger, and the cat.
Quite ignored until Elizabeth...
Heard a familiar voice.
Mother, it's Tao!
He's back!
Tao!
I can't believe it.
I know it's true,
But I can't believe it!
I'd never have bet on it.
It was hard to believe, yet there he was...
Safe in Elizabeth's arms.
Her cat was home.
Peter, I'm sorry.
Oh, it's all right.
Hi there, Luath.
I'm glad he's back, dad.
And Tao cat, too.
I knew all along
Bodger wouldn't make it.
He was just too old.
But Peter, you're not old, and he's the same age.
I feel old.
And with dogs it's different.
Look!
Bodger!
Bodger!
Bodger!
Miraculous as it seemed, it was Bodger.
Champion Buracastle
Brigadier of Doon,
Coming as fast as he could.
Come on, boy.
Hurry!
It is you!
Come on!
Oh, Bodger!
It is you, you silly dog.
Cut it out, Bodger.
Bodger, stop it.
And so it was,
3 devoted friends came marching home,
Together as always,
They came to the end of their incredible journey.
Come on! Knock it off.
Knock it off!
Gardner, keep telling them you're innocent.
Don't let them see you're afraid, kid!
It'll be all right, son.
I didn't wanna do it, sir.
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry!
I didn't... Sir? Sir?
It won't happen again, sir.
I didn't want...
I didn't...
Private Arthur James Gardner... you've been found guilty as charged for the crime of murder.
Your case has been appealed three times... and reviewed three times.
The verdict of each court-martial has been the same:
Guilty as charged.
Do you have anything to say before sentence is carried out?
I didn't mean it.
I... I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
I'm sorry.
Open it up.
Enjoy the show, major?
I want to see Major Armbruster.
- Just down the corridor...
- Yeah, I know where it is. I know.
John. Good to see you.
Don't you give me that. We had dinner last night together, remember?
Be nice. Take it easy.
This time it's serious, John.
You've gotta cooperate.
Let's go.
Colonel.
General is waiting, major.
Major Reisman, sir.
Sit down, gentlemen. Sit down.
- Sit down, major.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, major, what did you think of the hanging?
Looked very efficient.
Then again, I'm not an expert.
I meant, how did you personally feel about it?
It wasn't the nicest way to spend an evening.
Well, it wasn't staged for your entertainment, you know.
I hope Private Gardner was aware of that.
- Private who?
- Private Gardner.
He was the object of the exercise.
There happens to have been a reason, major.
I've got your service record here, major.
A lot of fireworks. A lot of transfers.
One tough scrape after another, very short on discipline.
Very short on discipline.
I hear you did a pretty good job in Italy.
Then you loused it up by exceeding your orders. And that's not the first time.
- I didn't write those reports, sir.
- What is that supposed to mean?
I don't necessarily agree with what's in them.
- Maybe you'd like to write your own?
- No, thank you, sir.
I'm not very interested in embroidery, only results.
Now, you hold it right there.
This war was not started for your private gratification.
And you can be damn sure that this Army... isn't being run for your personal convenience, either.
You've been waiting for a transfer for over two months now.
With a record like yours, you could go on waiting forever.
However, I get orders too.
And right now I've got some... that sound as if they were made for somebody just like you.
Personally, I don't go for this behind-the-lines nonsense.
As far as I'm concerned, a soldier's job is to wear his uniform and kill the enemy.
But that's another matter.
I'm gonna ask General Denton to read these orders... just as they came down to us.
After, if you have any questions, ask.
Understand?
- Yes, sir.
- General.
"Project Amnesty:
You will select 12 prisoners sentenced to death... or long-term imprisonment for murder, rape, robbery or other violent crimes.
Train these prisoners in as much of the behind-the-lines operations... as they can absorb in a brief but unspecified time.
You'll then deliver them secretly to Europe and prior to the invasion... attack and destroy the target specified: Overleaf."
- That's all?
- That's all.
What about the target specified,
Overleaf?
Doesn't concern you now.
Well, what do you say, major?
I'd say it confirms a suspicion
I've had for some time now, sir.
Do you think we might share that suspicion, major?
I think you should.
Since I'll have to assume we're over here to win the war... it wouldn't pay to advertise... that one man we're working for is a raving lunatic.
Now, that's enough, major. You're here to be briefed on an operation.
You have permission to ask questions about that operation.
You do not have permission to make personal comments... concerning the officers responsible for its conception.
- Now, is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Ask relevant questions or shut up.
Is it relevant to ask why I'm being offered this mission?
It's not, as you say, being offered.
I'm volunteering.
Exactly, major.
I'm glad you look at these things so realistically.
I don't mean to appear unduly cautious, but if my personal survival... depends on the performance of 12 deadheads... it might be helpful to know exactly what I'm training them for.
Now, that's a very good question, major.
- Armbruster, let's have the basic outline.
- Yes, sir.
"The Germans are using a large chateau near Rennes in Brittany... as a rest center and a conference place for general staff officers."
The target has no real military value itself... but with these conferences, discussion groups and the like going on... there's hardly a day when there aren't a considerable number... of important general officers in residence.
Usually with the benefit of female companionship.
"Eliminating a number of senior officers couldn't but have the effect... of disrupting their chain of command."
The idea is simply that our men are dropped by parachute.
They enter the chateau and kill as many senior officers as is possible... in the time available.
Naturally, the place is fortified and heavily guarded.
Naturally.
What's the deal with the men?
None whatsoever. Let's have no misunderstanding about that.
It's exactly what it says, an amnesty.
A temporary postponement.
You take it or leave it on that basis.
Like you say, sir, let's not have any misunderstandings.
I don't like it. I think it stinks.
I've had enough of your insolence.
It's not a question of insolence but of practicality.
I'm the guy that's being asked to sell this idea... to 12 happy, smiling faces, right?
They do have an alternative way to go, you know.
- That's no way for anybody to go.
- Oh, the hell you say, major.
Why, I know a lot of people who should go exactly that way.
But that's beside the point.
Now, come on, major, what's your basic objection?
These men are, by definition, incapable of any discipline or authority... much less intensive training.
If there isn't a possibility for a remission of their sentence... they have nothing to look forward to and no reason to cooperate, right?
Got a point.
You got a point, major.
However, as you know,
I don't have the power... to reverse the findings of a court-martial.
You do have the power to commute the sentence of such a court.
- Excuse me, general.
- Yes?
You do have authority under the Visiting
Forces Act to make such a ruling.
- Visiting Forces Act?
- Yes, sir.
All right, major, you got a deal.
Let's say that if any of these men distinguish themselves... then we will give serious consideration to commuting their sentences.
That's no deal.
Who's to say whether they really distinguish themselves or not?
You can leave that decision to me.
But remember, the other alternative will apply with equal force.
Any breach of security, any failure of discipline... those prisoners go right back where they came from.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
Good. Anything more, gentlemen?
Well, yes, sir. I noticed
Colonel Breed in the waiting room.
I wondered whether he was connected with this operation.
- What if he is?
- I'd be very unhappy, sir.
Major, Colonel Breed is your superior officer.
And you will behave accordingly, at all times.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Now, it so happens that Colonel Breed is not concerned with this operation.
But he is running the parachute school where part of your training will be.
I don't want to hear any complaints, from either of you.
Now, you've got a job to do, mister, so move it.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Major Reisman seems to be heading to his own court-martial.
He's the most ill-mannered, ill-disciplined officer... it's ever been my displeasure to meet.
You think so, Denton?
You may be right.
But he's sure right about one thing.
Somebody up there must be a raving lunatic.
Let's get Colonel Breed in here.
Open.
All right, you men, this is an exercise period.
So exercise!
Major Reisman, Sergeant Bowren, sir.
- Have the prisoners fall in.
- Sir.
Prisoners, fall in.
All right, come on now. Get with it!
- Come on, come on.
- Move it!
Come on, move!
Hey, you, move, I said, move.
"Franko, V.R.
Death by hanging.
Vladek, M.
Thirty years' hard labor.
Jefferson, R.T.
Death by hanging.
Pinkley, V.L.
Thirty years' imprisonment.
Gilpin, S.
Thirty years' hard labor.
Posey, S.
Death by hanging.
Wladislaw, T.
Death by hanging.
Sawyer, S.K.
Twenty years' hard labor.
Lever, R.
Twenty years' imprisonment.
Bravos, T.R.
Twenty years' hard labor.
Jiminez, P.
Twenty years' hard labor.
Maggott, A.J.
Death by hanging."
All right, sergeant. Have them fall in according to height, right to left.
According to height, fall in!
Come on, you jokers, you heard him.
Get in there! Fall in line!
- Come on, move!
- Come on, come on. Turn around.
Come on, here! I said, get in line.
Straighten up your jacket there.
Get over there.
- All right, have them count off.
- Sir. Count off!
Let's see what they can do with a little close-order.
- Hut, right!
- Right.
Left, march!
Hut, hut, hut, hut.
Two, three, four, hut, hut, hut.
Two, three.
Squad, halt!
About face!
Left, march!
Squad, halt!
Right face! At ease.
Now, what did I say to you?
Or maybe you don't understand English!
- What's the matter, Number 11?
- I got a pain.
- Where does it hurt?
- Well, I'll tell you. It's...
I wish you would.
And do it correctly, please.
Oh, I don't have to say, sir, I...
To you or anyone else.
And I don't have to march, either.
And I know the rules.
Why don't you have to march?
Because condemned men don't have to drill.
And there's nothing you can do about it, mister.
What's your name, son?
Eleven.
His name is Franko, sir.
Franko, come over here a minute.
Come on.
Look, you little bastard, either you march or I'll beat your brains out.
Understand?
What'd you see, sergeant?
I saw the major attacked by the prisoner and forced to defend himself, sir.
All right, have the prisoner taken back to his cell.
Take his head, I'll get his feet.
Now let's see what they can do with a little close-order.
Yes, sir.
Squad, ten-hut!
Right face.
Forward, march! Hut.
Squad, halt!
About face!
Forward, march!
General prisoner Franko, Victor, sir.
So how's the jaw?
If you're gonna act tough, you should learn how to take care of yourself.
You really should.
You're worried about my jaw?
Franko's pain bothers the major?
You were a big man with the syndicate back in Chicago?
You've seen my record.
Yeah, I've seen your record, so let's knock it off, huh?
So, what happens first when you hit London?
You get involved in a penny-ante stickup and start blasting and kill some old guy.
And come away with what?
- What did you have when they got you?
- What did I have? What do you mean?
Come on, big shot.
How much money did you have?
I had enough.
Two pounds and 10 shilling.
That's almost 10 dollars.
You're gonna get yourself hung for a lousy 10 bucks.
- What's that to you?
- Nothing.
Then why don't you get off my back?
You didn't come to visit me.
What do you want?
I don't care if they hang you for 10 dollars or 10 cents.
It makes no difference to me.
But it just so happens that temporarily
I got a little pull around here.
And I might be able to get you off the hook, if I wanted to.
Are you a general?
You're not a general, and only a general can grant my reprieve.
Look, stupid.
I'm making you a proposition.
All I want from you is a straight yes or no.
- You talk, I'll listen.
- Okay.
You either can sweat out the two days you have before the hanging... or you join an outfit that I'm putting together.
If you do that, I'll have you out of here in less than 24 hours.
But you'll be worked to death, and there's not a beating you won't take.
And then when I'm satisfied with you... you'll go where the Army tells you.
Chances are you'll get killed anyway.
You don't know Victor Franko.
- Guard.
- All right, what's the deal?
What's the deal if I do stay alive?
- Might get off the hook.
- Count me in.
But you foul up once, anywhere along the line, just once... and you'll be back here at the end of a rope.
Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute!
What's the matter with you?
You think I want to die?
If you do, then you don't know Victor Franko.
How come you speak German?
Because my old man was a coal miner in Silesia.
If he didn't speak German, he didn't dig coal and he didn't eat.
That was the language he spoke when he came to the States?
Pretty tough job in those days.
Yeah, it still is.
I don't like officers, not any of them, and I never have.
But you were one yourself, weren't you?
Yeah, three lousy days.
Somebody must have thought you'd make a good officer.
They made a big mistake, didn't they?
Well, I thought you claimed he was going over the hill.
What the hell are you talking about,
"claimed"?
He was going over the hill.
My outfit was pinned down by the worst crossfire you ever saw.
Half of them bleeding to death.
And this lover took off like a rabbit... with the medical supplies on his back.
The only way to stop him was to shoot him.
Anyhow, he had it coming.
Yeah. But you only made one mistake, huh?
Guard.
You let somebody see you do it.
General prisoner Maggott, A.J., sir.
"Maggott, A.J. Death by hanging."
Hey, midnight.
Be a real good boy, now, and maybe
I'll let you eat with the white folks.
Well, Maggott, I see you've got a sense of humor.
The all-American hero, laughing in the face of death.
They're not gonna hang me, major.
I never raped that evil slut... or any other creature.
The Lord gave me that woman and told me to chastise her.
Then he told you to beat her to death, huh?
I only do what I'm called on to do.
I was in a state of grace.
And that woman... she tried to soil my spirit.
Well, I'm sure you were, Maggott.
But it seems to me I remember a quotation that goes like:
Vengeance is mine.
Vengeance is mine.
I will repay, sayeth the Lord.
Paul to the Romans, Chapter 12.
Exactly. Now, isn't that supposed to mean... that we leave punishment of the transgressors to his hands?
That's right, major.
That's exactly what it means.
But it doesn't restrict him to the kind of tools he would use, now does it?
And like I told you, major,
I only do what I'm called on to do.
You know, Maggott, I don't think you're going to hang after all.
I think a man like you is destined for higher things. Guard.
Besides, us Southern boys have to stick together now, don't we?
I sure didn't mean to kill that fella.
But you do like I say, and maybe they won't hang you.
Fixing to kill me some other way?
It might not come to that.
I reckon the folks would be a sight happier if I died like a soldier.
Can't say I would.
Who does this hotshot major think he is?
Making us play wet nurses to a bunch of scum.
Corporal Morgan.
If you can't find something to do,
I'll find something for you.
Now, move it.
Don't sweet-talk me, whitey.
You know why I'm here.
Or maybe you think I should've let those cracker bastards... go right ahead and castrate me?
Seeing what those guys tried to do to you...
I'd say that you had considerable justification.
Thank you, Mr. Major, sir.
I really do thank you for that.
But the court didn't agree, right?
So where does that leave you?
I'm offering you an alternative, which means you can keep fighting.
- Who for, major?
- For yourself, if you want.
But the Krauts, they're the real master-race merchants.
That's your war, man, not mine.
You don't like the Krauts, major, you fight them.
Me, I'll pick my own enemies.
That's your privilege. But you won't be able to exercise it much longer.
Guard.
Because on March 25th, you have a date with the hangman.
That's just six days from now.
Buenos dias, major.
You know, sergeant, going over the transcript of that man's trial... there are a couple of things
I don't get.
Did he ever claim that he didn't do it?
I beg your pardon, but you haven't been around prisons very much, have you?
You see, the first thing one learns in prison, everybody is innocent.
This one, he doesn't say too much about that one way or another.
He's only disturbed because we don't allow him to have strings for his guitar.
Sergeant, did you ever lose a man... because he hung himself with a guitar string?
No, sir, I haven't, and I'm not about to.
Well, if he makes the trip, see he gets the strings.
Yes, sir.
Attention!
- Tell the men to be seated.
- Yes, sir. Take seats!
- Guards out.
- Sir, I...
- Guards out.
- Yes, sir.
You heard him. Guards, out!
My name, for those of you who may have forgotten, is Reisman.
You've all volunteered for a mission which gives you just three ways to go:
You can foul up in training and be sent back here for execution of sentence... or you can foul up in combat... in which case
I'll blow your brains out... or you can do as you're told, in which case you might just get by.
You must not attempt to escape.
There will be no excuses, there will be no appeal.
Any breach of either of these conditions by any one of you... means you'll all be shipped back for immediate execution of sentence.
You are therefore dependent upon each other.
Any one of you try anything smart... and the 12 of you get it right in the head, all right?
So try to remember that.
Now, are there any questions?
Sir?
Do we have to eat with niggers?
It's all right.
The gentleman from the South... made some kind of inquiries about the dining arrangements.
He and his colleagues are discussing the place-card settings. All right?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Look, corporal, fellas, let's get with it, right? Remember?
Baseball, pitching?
Chicago's always had the pitching.
But now, as far as...
As far as hitting goes... well, my sister, she can hit better than half them fellas.
Let's move it out!
- Well, what do you think, sergeant?
- I think you'll do just fine, sir.
Don't give me that.
I said, what do you think?
I think the first chance one of them lovers gets... he's gonna shoot the major right in the head, sir.
- Thank you, sergeant.
- Sir.
Okay, Franko. Let's go.
All right, move it out.
Come on.
Over there.
Sergeant, have the men fall in, facing me.
Sir. All right, on your feet. Fall in over here, double-quick! Come on now!
Come on, snap it up.
Snap it up!
Jiminez, get in there!
Ten-hut!
All right, Franko, get rid of that cigarette.
Thank you.
This will be your new home until further notice.
What there is of it will be built by you, but the construction... will in no way interfere with your training.
So the sooner you get it up, the sooner you'll be sleeping in out of the rain.
- Sergeant.
- Sir?
You're in charge. I want this compound up and completed within the month.
Thank you.
If this place was on fire, it'd burn to the ground.
Come on, what are you doing?
All right, come on. Let's move.
Come on.
Hey, Maggott, what are you? German?
Hey, what are you trying to do, break the window?
All right, sergeant, fall them in.
Fall in, in front of the hut.
On the double!
Round it up!
At ease.
All right, that'll be all for today.
How come they got all the comforts of home?
Why can't we put our floor in?
Why can't we put our windows in?
- Franko's right.
- I'd rather sleep in my cell.
Mr. Franko, with his keen eye for detail... has noted that the prisoners' quarters are not yet ready.
The answer to that is simple:
You are not yet ready to occupy that hut... with the degree of comfort that you would like.
When I think that you've earned that privilege, I'll let you know.
Reveille is at 0530.
That is all. Sergeant.
Sir. You heard the man, chow time!
Dismissed!
That's it, fellas. Speak up, boys.
Speak up.
Wind it up, strike one!
Hey, Joseph, is that the way they did it in the Polish navy?
You won't win any cigars that way.
Hey, Franko, number please.
Ask the operator for my nickel back.
Why don't you guys just dry up and blow away?
Meanwhile, on the Atlantic wall...
the German forces
have been preparing...
a few nice surprises for you,
gentlemen...
just in case Mr. Churchill...
is really foolish enough
to attempt an invasion.
He may not be
unduly worried about this...
but then, of course, he will not
be taking any active part...
in such an...
Hey, what's this guy's name again?
You ought to know.
You listen to him every night.
- Dumbo, get me a cup of coffee.
- You crazy?
I say shut the guy up.
- Sleepy time.
- Hey, jump through this, will you?
Hey, you. Come here.
You look like an intelligent guy.
- You like it here?
- No.
You gonna stay here?
- Well, I ain't got nowhere else to go.
- Ah, you're an idiot.
Hey, Wladislaw.
You understand German.
Who's that dame singing about?
Well, it's about a very lonely girl... who's sick and tired of war and being left alone.
- Waiting for her man to come home.
- Keep that cheap, wailing slut quiet!
Let's cut out the community sing.
Get some sleep. You're gonna need it.
Up yours.
Creeps. They're all creeps.
That's what they are. Creeps.
- Hey, where you going?
- Going to the can.
- Want me to come with you?
- You kidding?
They're after Franko.
You trying to get us all hung?
We're all dead anyway. Don't tell me you believe that creep Reisman.
Want that slick bum to make suckers out of you? Whose side are you on?
What's with you?
What is this, anyway?
Uncle Tom week?
You come with me, we're home free.
He doesn't give a damn about you.
If we go on that mission, we all get killed. That's what they want!
Those idiots in there are gonna get shot, and they're not even due for hanging.
You, you slob, you slob.
What do you think you got coming?
- Slipped on a bar of soap, huh?
- Yeah.
Pull with your arms, hold with your legs.
Pull with your arms, hold with your legs.
Come on, Jiminez. Move it.
When the time comes... you've got exactly 34 seconds to clear that distance.
I really can't make it, major.
Oh, come on, Jiminez.
Move it. Don't stop now.
I can't! I can't!
- Come on, Jiminez. Move.
- I really can't.
I can't make it, major.
I can't make it! I can't make it!
Jiminez! You come back down that rope, you're going straight back to prison.
I can't. I can't!
Really, I can't.
Sergeant, give me that weapon.
Take a spin on that rope.
I can't make it. I can't make it!
I can't!
I really can't make it, major.
I can't!
Boy, look at him go now!
So you couldn't make it, huh?
Okay, Posey, let's see a little of that Apache know-how.
Re-thread that pulley and get another rope down here. Come on!
Give these other characters a crack at immortality.
You said Mayonnaise was the only one supposed to get on top of that chateau.
But suppose Jiminez gets killed before he gets to the top of that chateau.
- Come on, Posey. Move it.
- Come on, get that thing up here.
We'll have it ready in a minute, major.
All right, Franko, you're next.
All right, so much for hygiene on the field.
Now, which one of you guys would like to stick this in the major?
Well, major, if it's gonna help the war effort...
Franko, sit down.
You'll get your chance.
Well, let's see...
- Posey.
- Me?
Yeah, step out here.
I'd rather not, sir.
Look, Posey, it's just an example.
Come on, now. Step out here.
Now, will you hold this knife?
Posey, it's got a scabbard on it.
It can't hurt anybody.
Tell me, Posey, what did they lock you up for?
I mean, what did you do?
I already told you that, sir.
Well, tell me again.
I'm sure that your friends over here would like to know too.
- What'd you do, Posey?
- Yeah, fill him in.
This fella kept pushing me.
I don't like to be pushed, so I hit him.
Killed a man with your bare hands because he shoved you?
I only hit him once.
Only hit him once.
And drove his jawbone right through his brain because he pushed him.
- I didn't mean to kill him.
- You didn't mean to kill him, but you did.
Now, what would you do if you meant to kill somebody? Could you do it?
If you had to kill somebody with a knife, do you think you could do it?
- Come on. Tell me.
- I'd rather not.
I don't care what you'd rather do.
Come on, stick that knife in me.
You can do that. Come on.
Major, I don't want to do this.
Come on, Posey. Just stick it right here in me, it won't hurt.
Come on.
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You're not. I'm gonna hurt you.
- Posey, stick me.
- I don't want no trouble.
You got no trouble. I'll give you all the trouble you'll get.
Come on, now, Posey. Just stick that knife right there, right there.
You're a big boy.
You killed a man for shoving you?
I'm shoving you.
- Come on. Let me have it.
- Stick him!
I'm talking to you. Give it to me or I'm gonna shove you right through the wall!
Come on, Posey. Give it to him!
- Stab him!
- Get him, Posey! Come on, Posey!
I want that knife.
Why won't you give it to me?
- I don't like to be shoved, major.
- You're being shoved!
- Stick him!
- Knock him down, Posey!
Posey. What a name for a guy like you.
- Stop!
- Don't tell me what to do.
- I'm giving orders.
- I don't like pushing.
Give it to him, Pose! Come on!
I don't like to be shoved.
Stop pushing!
Posey. Posey!
- Posey.
- Yes, sir?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
All right, now. Relax.
Come on, get up.
You know, you learn how to take care of that temper of yours... ain't nobody gonna take this knife away from you.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Okay, major. We're all set.
All right, you go in and see Captain Kinder.
- What's he gonna do?
- He's just gonna talk to you, Posey.
- Brush yourself off and go on in.
- Yes, sir.
All right, which of you gentlemen is next?
Come on. I'm looking for a volunteer.
All right, Maggott. You're next.
Speed it up, men.
Come on, speed it up.
They're looking good.
Yes, sir. I hope they don't forget what they're getting in shape for.
Captain Kinder figures maybe he can teach me letters.
Folks back home would be proud if I could write.
Well, that would put you way ahead of most of the guys around here.
- Better fall in and join them.
- Yes, sir.
It's true that I've been blessed... with an insight into women that others don't have.
And sometimes...
Well, sometimes I'm called upon... to use it in our beloved master's will.
If women are your special province, why do you hate Major Reisman so much?
There are 11 evil men out there... and they must be punished for their wickedness.
And this Major Reisman, he just snatched them up... from the brink of the pit, and he cheated the master of his vengeance.
And you think that's what God wants?
To punish these men?
Oh, he will, captain. He will.
And Major Reisman too.
- So, what does that give you?
- It doesn't give me anything.
But along with these other results, it gives you... about the most twisted, anti-social bunch of psychopathic deformities ever.
And the worst, the most dangerous of the bunch is Maggott.
You've got one religious maniac, one malignant dwarf, two near-idiots...
And the rest, I don't even want to think about.
Well, I can't think of a better way to fight a war.
The results of these tests point to the fact that each man... has a built-in resentment against any kind of authority. Any kind.
- Don't you?
- But this is different.
These guys think the U.S. Army is their enemy, not the Germans.
Well, they know the U.S. Army.
But the Krauts haven't done anything to them yet.
Very sophisticated.
Well, at least they know the U.S. Army.
You can twist it any way you want.
But the point is... you are their main enemy.
And when the time comes, you'll be the number one target.
Well, at least it gives them something in common.
What do you mean?
They've come a long way individually, further than we have a right to expect.
But not as a unit. Not as a group.
They've gotta function as a team.
And that's what's lacking.
You think putting them on guard duty will help?
Well, it might give them a sense of participation.
Why don't you let me weed out the real morons? Especially Maggott.
I didn't pick these men, the Army did.
And I didn't pick the assignment either.
This is one time the Army's going with a starting lineup all the way.
- Including Maggott?
- Including Maggott.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- We could get ourselves hurt, right?
- Why don't you shut up, huh?
What's the matter?
You planning to save your mother?
Why don't you lay off?
Want me to show you how to do it, huh?
All right.
Take my arm, put it around your neck.
Very simple, right?
And then it's all in the leverage.
Better learn how to fall.
You'll end up in a wheelchair.
That's what I tried to tell him.
Trouble is you just don't know how to fall right. Here.
Slob. Ah, that's a bad attitude.
Kind of rough on the little fella, aren't you? Like to try that with me?
Now, this is really quite simple.
I'm going to say a word, and you come back at me... as fast as you can with whatever comes to mind.
For instance, if I were to say
"happiness," you might say "children."
I wouldn't say that.
Well, that was just an example.
But if I said "ambition," what would you say?
I wouldn't say anything.
Well, let's give it a try, okay?
- Weapon.
- Baseball.
- Knife.
- Dodgers.
- Officer.
- Pitcher.
You seem to be thinking about just one thing, aren't you?
Yeah. What are you thinking about?
Well, you see, I don't want you to think of just one thing.
I'd like for you to concentrate on each word I throw at you. Okay?
Okay.
Food.
Cincinnati.
- Comfort.
- Chicago.
- Now, what made you say that?
- That's what I was thinking about.
The hell with it!
Franko, what is it this time?
How am I supposed to shave in cold water?!
You're in the field now.
Where are you gonna get hot water?
The guards got hot water!
You got hot water!
- You're in the field!
- That's tough.
Right. How come you guys have hot water and we don't?
You keep quiet!
You keep your big mouth shut.
- We ain't shaving in cold water!
- Not if all you don't.
You want us to shave in cold water?
Why don't you?
- That's right.
- Yeah!
Franko means it.
We ain't shaving. We ain't washing.
Not in cold water!
- Is that right?
- That's right!
The guards got hot, we won't use cold.
And you can't make us!
You're gonna get yourself into hot water, Franko.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna hang us?
What can they do?
They can't do nothing!
- Nothing.
- Now what are you gonna do?
You know, I think Franko might be right this time.
Yeah, shaving in cold water won't make us any better soldiers.
Excuse me, sir.
We got some trouble outside.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear.
- All right, sergeant. Fall them in.
- Yes, sir.
All right, fall in. On your feet!
Come on, right over here, Posey!
Come on! Dress it up there. Get in line!
What's this about refusing to shave?
Who is refusing to shave?
- We are!
- Who is we?
We!
All those refusing to shave, take one step forward.
So you want to stink, huh?
And maybe itch too?
Well, that's okay with me because I don't have to smell you.
Sergeant, there will be no further issue of shaving equipment... or the use of soap.
And there will be no more hot meals.
Just K rations.
Courtesy of Mr. Franko.
At ease.
- Hey, I really think we got something.
- Yeah, it's what the Navy calls "mutiny."
No, no. Remember what I was saying last night about 12 rugged individualists?
So?
You heard them. It was "we ain't gonna do this and we ain't gonna do that."
When I asked them to step forward, even Posey joined.
I'll bet you he's been shaving in cold water since he was a kid.
Boy, do I love that Franko.
That means that we are going to have that much more time for work.
Right?
So now, if you...
You "dirty dozen" have no objections... we will get our equipment... and we will start in right now.
Attention!
Ready, hut!
That's very good.
You look just like real soldiers.
Fall out!
Now, move it!
You're still the dirtiest soldiers in this man's army... and you're getting filthier every day.
But your training is almost over.
In two days, you'll be learning how to jump with a parachute... and you'll learn quick.
This training will take place at a regular Army base.
And I just want to remind you that this operation is secret.
Top secret.
You will not be wearing dog tags.
You will not say anything to anyone.
Do you understand? Nothing.
Nothing!
One word, one slip from any one of you... and the deal is off!
And you all know what that means, right?
All right, serve it up.
All right, serve it up!
Colonel Breed won't like this secrecy bit.
He'll want to know.
- We're still top-priority, aren't we?
- You can't ignore his author...
- Do we have the juice?
- Yes, but Colonel Br...
Then I don't care what Colonel Breed likes.
Look, you're supposed to be the liaison officer.
I want you to get orders to the highest echelon... stating to Colonel Everett
Dasher Breed... that a group, over which he will have no authority, will be arriving Tuesday... and the identity of the men is secret.
Tell him we got a general with them... tell him anything you want, just get that West Point bum off of my back.
A general, huh?
I'll see what I can do.
- I know you will.
- Hey, Franko. What is it, man?
- What kind of food is that?
- Pig face, serve it up!
What is it?
I don't know. I never ate anything like this before.
I've stepped in it a couple of times, but I never ate it.
What is it?
Did you ask what general?
Yes, sir. Got the same thing again.
No information beyond what was in the order.
What about General Denton?
When we first called, his extension was busy. Now he's not there.
Not now.
- Well, what about you?
- Nothing, sir.
Not now, you...
I think they're coming.
Yeah, it's them.
Yes? Sir, they just passed the checkpoint.
Let's go.
Now. Now!
Sounds like we're running into a party.
Boy, you don't suppose it's for us, do you?
Present arms!
Major Reisman reporting, sir.
Where's the general?
He's in the truck. But you understand that he's traveling incognito.
We thought he might care to inspect our number one platoon.
If you give me a moment,
I'll see if he's willing to do that.
Order, halt!
How come the band?
- What are we waiting for?
- They're inspecting the guest list.
- What guest list?
- What's the matter with you?
Which one of you wants to be a general?
Be a what?
Pinkley.
What? What kind of a general, sir?
Just a plain ordinary, everyday, home-loving American general.
I'd rather be a civilian, sir.
What do I have to do?
You've seen generals inspecting troops.
Just walk slow and act stupid.
Up one rank, down the other, and straight back to the truck.
They're expecting a general, and that's exactly what they'll get.
So let's go.
- Move it. Come on, move it!
- Ten-hut!
Present arms!
Move it.
Let's go, move it.
Fall in!
- Pinkley's gonna be a general.
- Why?
- Pinkley's gonna be a general.
- What for?
Shut up and watch.
First Platoon waiting for inspection, sir!
They're very pretty, colonel.
Very pretty.
- But can they fight?
- Yes, sir.
I hope you're right.
- Where are you from, son?
- Madison City, Missouri, sir.
Never heard of it.
All right, major, let's go. We got work to do. Thank you, colonel.
Hold it down. Hold it down.
You pull a stunt like that again,
I'll beat your brains out.
Major, you d...
Sergeant, fall them into a column of twos, then move out.
Yes, sir. Fall out. Fall into column of twos on me. Fall out!
Reisman!
Some people may consider you a first-class officer.
But as far as I'm concerned, you're a disorganized, undisciplined clown.
I'm gonna make it my business to run you out of this Army.
I owe you an apology, colonel.
I always thought that you were a cold, unimaginative, tight-lipped officer.
But you're really quite emotional, aren't you?
Clayton, Blake.
- Hey, watch it.
- Look out, will you?
- Hey, hold this.
- All right, let's go!
- Do you believe this guy?
- Okay, all right, we're coming!
Come on, let's go!
You're in the way.
What's the matter with you guys?
- Listen, buster.
- Hands off!
Now, take it easy.
- Just want to ask you a few questions.
- Questions, huh?
Hold him! Hold him!
You son of a...
In the gut, so it don't show.
That's the way!
Talk, you bastard.
Who the hell are you?
- Number Nine, you crumb.
- Number Nine?
- You gonna tell us or not?
- Go to hell.
Hold him.
Where the hell are your dog tags?
- I ate them.
- You ate them?
- You gonna tell us now?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- Number Nine!
- Wladislaw!
What happened?
They tried to make me talk.
Where the hell have you been?
- Wait. What happened to him?
- He slipped on a bar of soap.
Everybody's slipping on soap.
Of all the miserable...
- Who?
- Who? Reisman.
He had a couple of those paras jump him.
- Major did this?
- Gave him a pretty hard time.
- Well?
- Well, what?
Did he tell them anything?
Are you crazy?
Three wise men.
"Trust your major."
I'd rather trust Hitler.
- All right, move it out.
- Come on, move it! Move it!
You'll find this easier than our jump-tower training.
Action stations!
Go!
Morgan.
- Yes, sir.
- They should be here any minute now.
Get the men together.
I'll talk to them first.
- We'll use your hut tonight.
- Our hut?
Your hut.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
All right, Ike and Mike.
Come on, get on your feet.
Come on, let's go.
Move it!
What are you, the Gold Dust Twins?
What, you need a special invitation?
- No, sir.
- No, sir?
- I mean, yes, sir.
- Then move it.
That's TS, Greek.
Why don't you tell it to the chaplain?
All right, you foul-ups, come on!
Get over to the MP hut.
The man wants to talk to you.
Come on, move it!
All right.
Stop pushing.
Come on, off it now. Let's get going!
So this is how the other half lives.
Get going!
Hey, we're not going to the junior prom.
- Pretty sweet, huh?
- No dancing. Come on, let's go!
- They got electricity.
- Nice to be rich.
- Hey, what does he want to see us for?
- A radio.
- A radio?
- Hey, look at those pictures.
Maybe the guards are lonesome.
- Horny bunch of mothers.
- Wow!
All right, give them a little air, boys.
Move it, Jiminez.
Okay, sarge.
Well, jump school didn't kill you.
Maybe that stuff will.
Your training's about over and I figure that entitles you... to a graduation ball or something.
You have cups and glasses.
All right, wheel them in.
Shall I say they're with your compliments?
Hell, no.
Tell them it's part of their training.
Yes, sir.
Where are we?
Oh! Somebody in this truck has a cold nose.
Get off me foot!
Watch yourself, baby.
- Have you hurt yourself?
- It's a limey barrack!
I'm not one for orgies meself.
- Should've asked for more money.
- Bitch.
You sadists!
- Good evening.
- I'm already too worn out to work.
- Right this way, ladies.
- Move along. That's nice.
Good evening, major.
I could only get eight, sir. It's like cops.
If you want one, you can't find them.
- Good evening, ladies.
- Good evening, admiral.
Blimey, they're filthy!
They may be, lady, but they sure do mean well.
Hey!
All present and accounted for, major.
You gentlemen will be on duty again at 0600 hours in the morning.
That's, oddly enough, the same amount of time... that these young ladies have allotted to be your guests.
In the meantime, I suggest that you use that time to get acquainted.
I don't believe that Mr. Maggott would care to indulge... so I suggest you save some whiskey for him when he gets off of duty.
Good night, gentlemen. Ladies.
Good night, colonel.
- Are you crazy?
- Let's go. We might inhibit them.
- You want to bet?
- Major!
Yes, you, Major Reisman!
I saw those filthy strumpets!
You're turning this place into a bottomless pit of vice!
Comes Judgment Day!
And Judgment Day is coming!
Those men, major, they'll suffer eternal damnation... because of you, major!
Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open.
You're on guard duty, Maggott.
Want to dance?
There's no music.
Try humming.
All right, girls, you want to lose those wraps?
- Put on that radio.
- Make yourself at home.
You think those guys realize tomorrow's Mother's Day?
Is it?
Now they're doing it to music.
- This is a restricted area, sir.
- I know that.
Two groups, three ranks in.
Open the gate.
Come on, let's move it!
Open this gate.
Yes, sir.
Hey, look at those guys.
You can't come in here, sir!
Sergeant, take his weapon.
Take his weapon.
Corporal Morgan. Sergeant, get that rabble in some kind of order.
Yes, sir. Commander, man to man!
Sir, you are contravening a direct order.
Contravening nothing!
Fall in with the rest and speak when you're spoken to.
You heard what the colonel said.
Fall in!
Come on, move it!
All right, you heard what he said.
Fall in!
Come on, come on!
Let's get the lead out.
What's he all upset about?
All right, you bunch of foul-ups.
Come on. Grab a formation.
Fall in there!
Come on, you yard birds!
You believe this Army?
We gotta be losing.
Move it! What's wrong with you?
You got lead in them?
Come on, get going!
Hey, ain't those the jokers that roughed you up in the latrine?
Come on!
Hey, come on, pick it up!
Yeah, we had Reisman all wrong.
- Come on, move it!
- Not now. Wait for it.
What's going on up there?
Hey, you!
What are you, something special?
We gotta wait all day for you?
Come on!
Get in position there.
Let's try and make a straight line.
Let's look like soldiers, huh?
I told you nobody could pass.
Now, open the gate. Let's get going.
Those are the two guys that got Wladislaw.
Those are the two guys that gave Wladislaw his lumps.
Those are the two guys that jumped Wladislaw.
Those are the two guys that banged Wladislaw.
Those two gorillas beat up Wladislaw.
Those are the two guys...
In my opinion... the officer in command of this operation... has either disregarded his orders or is flagrantly disobeying them... one way or the other.
And that is what I am here to find out.
All right... gentlemen, let's understand each other.
I'm here to find out exactly what this is all about... and I intend to do it if it takes all day.
Now, you can make it easy or tough on yourself. That's up to you.
Before I leave, we're going to find out who's involved in this insanity... what you're doing here and why.
Is that understood?
All right, general.
What's your name, rank and serial number?
You tell him, we've all had it!
Quiet!
What's your name, soldier?
Number Two, sir.
Morgan. Clayton.
Yes, sir?
Give Clayton this man's name, rank and serial number. For all of them.
- I really don't know that, sir.
- Then tell him what you do know.
You fink, you tell him nothing!
- What was that talk down there?
- Nothing, sir.
Come here, soldier.
When did you bathe last?
- I don't remember, sir.
- You're filthy.
You're a disgrace to the uniform.
Sergeant Fredericks, get a razor and water.
He will demonstrate proper procedure for shaving and bathing in the field.
- Yes, sir.
- Right, soldier?
No, sir!
No, sir, what?
No, sir, I am not going to shave, sir!
Then we'll have to do it the hard way.
Clayton, Blake, dry-shave him.
Now!
- Reisman!
- That's right!
You be good enough to have your men dispose of their weapons!
- Sergeant Bowren!
- Sir!
Get some special help and get those weapons!
Yes, sir.
All right, you heard the man!
Now, get moving!
Hit them only where it hurts.
- Turn it loose!
- That's great.
Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.
You Nazi!
I'm with you, major, all the way.
Don't call us, we'll call you.
You must be out of your mind.
It might seem that way.
Take it all back, colonel.
They aren't pretty and they can't fight.
They're all 4-Fs!
Hey, colonel, I hear they don't even use parachutes!
Hey, colonel, you crybaby!
Don't just stand there, pick it up!
- Stick around for tea.
- Put some money in there.
Come again, colonel!
Stop by any time, bozo.
I'm sure you look upon your service record as being highly colorful, major.
Well, that's not my view of it.
I think you know I was never in favor of you leading this operation.
So I can't say that I'm disappointed in your performance.
Because the impression you made on me was unfavorable in the first place.
You behave as if this were a personal matter.
Let me assure you, it isn't.
What happens to you is something to which I am indifferent.
But the nature of the operation
I am running is not.
Colonel Breed's report on your unit's level of achievement... and general behavior at the parachute training school is entirely negative.
It would in itself justify my recommendation... that this operation be canceled.
Your men will be sent back for execution of sentence.
Whether disciplinary action should be taken against you... is a matter for General Worden here.
I take it you don't deny your responsibility for the fact that... on the night of April 14-15, a military establishment of the U.S. Army... was the scene of a drunken party... at which no less than seven female civilians took an active part.
Oh, yes, sir, they took an active part all right.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Are you in a position to offer even the remotest mitigating circumstances?
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, sergeant, more ice.
Yes, sir.
Well?
You offered those men a chance to get off the hook, and they worked hard.
Now that they're just shaping up, you're gonna say, "Sorry, the deal's off"?
You've only yourself to blame for that.
You brought those women to camp.
So I broke an Army regulation.
You're gonna kill five men and send the rest to prison for life?
Because if you did that... you'd have to lock up half the U.S. Army, officers included.
Anyway, you said it yourself, it was my fault.
It's not gonna affect their ability as soldiers.
Yes, well, we've heard about their ability as soldiers from Colonel Breed.
That's his opinion.
My men have crammed six months of intensive training into as many weeks.
As of this moment, I'd stack them up against any men in the Army.
You can't be serious.
You're damn right I am!
They might not be pretty... but any one of mine is worth 10 of yours.
- Those comparisons are hardly the point.
- It's precisely the point.
My contention is that my men are more than able to handle any job given them.
Now, you gentlemen set this thing up.
You promised them a chance.
At least you can let them show you what they're capable of.
I shudder to think what they might be capable of.
Give them a chance to prove it, then if they fail, your conscience is clear.
Tell me, major... just how would you have your men prove it?
It can't be done, can it?
Well, yes. I suppose it could.
I mean, there might be a way.
What I mean is, general, if you recall... next week we've got divisional maneuvers in Devonshire.
Yes, yes, yes.
Colonel Breed's outfit will be part of that exercise.
As a matter of fact, one of his companies... has been assigned the defense of divisional headquarters.
So?
So...
So you let my 12 men act as an independent unit... attached to the opposing force.
And they'll knock out Breed's headquarters and capture his entire staff.
That I'd like to see.
So would I.
Charlie and Fox Companies will support the back of the woods.
They'll need supplies from the 2nd Battalion.
Rogers won't like that, but I don't want to hear about it.
- Yes, sir.
- How's Johnson's armor?
They just ran through two minutes ago, sir. The armor's all set.
Hold it!
Back!
Change!
You think we're gonna get away with this?
Smile, you idiots! If those blue slobs recognize us, we're in trouble.
Can you believe it?
They shaved.
How about that?
Get a load of the major.
He can't believe we made it.
- The day go fast, major?
- You're beautiful, but you're late.
- Got everything you need?
- Absolutely.
Think you can remember the plan?
- So where'd you get the vehicle?
- We stole it.
Like we're gonna steal everything else.
We're playing war games, right?
Anything else, sir?
I guess not. All right, we'll be with the generals at headquarters.
From now on, you're on your own.
So take off and good luck.
Let's move!
All right, split up into three groups.
These two belong to you?
Where's General Worden?
Well, he's gone to check up in the field, sir.
Oh, my God.
- Well?
- Be with you in a minute, sir.
- Well, how about this one?
- Yes, sir. I think that's it, sir.
Oh, that's excellent,
Haskell, excellent!
Come on, let's go.
- We made it.
- Where are the others?
8:45. Four of them ought to be coming over that ridge soon.
0845? They'd better be coming fast then.
The enemy is gonna lay a live barrage on that ridge at 0850. Did you know that?
Yes, sir, I knew that.
But that's the one direction Colonel
Breed won't be looking for them.
- Are they all set?
- All set, sir.
Batteries one, three and four, open fire and continue at will.
Batteries one, three and four, open fire and continue at will.
Batteries one, three and four...
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Come on!
Let's go! Come on!
Load!
Now, come on!
- While they're reloading!
- Let's go!
- Down! Can't you hear it?!
- Hit it!
Secure guards!
All right, let's go!
Let's go.
Now, what the hell were you guys waiting for?
What do you m...?
Mean, boy?
Those lovers were trying to kill us back there.
Change.
Change? What do you mean, "change"?
You can't do that!
It's all right, major.
We're gonna change back later.
They can't stop us now.
Let's go.
Come on.
We're on our way.
We get across this road, take 10.
What are we waiting here for?
For a jeep, a heavy machine gun and four men.
Like this one?
Slow down.
Ten-hut!
Good afternoon, general.
The Mafia has landed!
- Whatever Franko says, Franko does!
- Machine gun.
Let's get it out. Move it out.
- Come on, snap it up.
- Franko, out!
Out? What do you mean, "out"?
- Who do you think stole this thing?
- You did, my boy.
Look, you and Pinkley are the only guys that Colonel Breed got a good look at.
This operation is a big enough risk without you coming along.
- Out.
- Come on, Franko.
Jefferson, you have until 0930 to show up with the ambulance.
You don't make it,
I'll figure you got nailed.
- Then we'll take a whack at plan B.
- Right.
So long, major.
Hold on, Maggott.
Don't want to lose you now.
Attention!
Attention.
Ten-hut!
- Morning, Breed.
- Morning. Quite a surprise.
- Everything under control?
- I think you could say that, sir.
Good, good.
At ease, gentlemen, at ease.
Just thought I'd drop by to see how things are shaping up.
So this is what it looks like, huh?
Come on, push!
- Posey, remember, you're hurt.
- Oh, I'm dying.
Come on, Maggott.
Stand back, now.
- What's that?
- Over there!
- What was that?
- Down the road, sir. See that smoke?
- Sergeant, have somebody take a look.
- Yes, sir.
- What are they doing around that ridge?
- I don't know, sir.
That should've been cleared half an hour ago.
Now, colonel, it sure doesn't look like it's been cleared, does it?
Let's go.
- Posey, remember, you're injured.
- Gilpin, you forgot the ketchup.
- Help!
- Come on.
Sir?
We got a man that's hurt bad.
We'd like to call an ambulance.
Call an ambulance.
Go see what happened.
- Yes, sir. Come on, you two.
- Private?
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.
What were you doing on that road?
Our jeep got a flat tire.
We went into a ditch.
I didn't ask you that. I asked you what you were doing on that road.
Spotting for the Field Artillery, sir.
Let's see that map.
Move Able, Charlie Company to... the bridge under smoke screen.
Baker Company bank towards the ridge at 1420 hours.
- Private. Come here.
- Yes, sir.
What's your name and outfit?
Private Matthew Donald, sir.
Serial number 726256.
Battery B, 526th Field Artillery, sir.
- Where are your orders?
- Right here, sir.
From Captain Thornhill, sir.
I know most of the men under my command.
But I don't recall seeing you before.
No, sir.
I was transferred in last week, sir.
We're getting congested at point B.
Two forces have mined the road.
- Where's Peterson?
- Here it comes!
Clear the way!
Looks like somebody got hurt.
Watch it there!
Okay, let's have some help with this soldier.
Count of three, lift. One, two, lift.
Take it easy now.
- Where do we put him, sir?
- Put him there.
- You can stay, but keep out of the way.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Sorry, but this is the end of the line for you.
But we got a bad accident down here, sir.
That's too bad, because you just became prisoners of war.
It's the enemy, sir!
All right, come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.
They can't do that.
You're wearing Red Force insignia.
That's right. We're traitors.
- Watch my finger.
- They use real bullets, you idiot!
Now, look here, I'm a doctor, major.
And I'm a major, captain.
Yes, sir, but we had a radio message.
There's a man badly hurt down there.
Hurry it up!
Here's our permission to cross all lines and roadblocks.
Very cute idea, captain.
But it won't work. Get out.
But it's not a gag, sir.
There's a real casualty there.
All set back here, Jefferson.
Sir, will you explain the rules to him?
The man may be dying.
I'm just an observer, captain, not an umpire.
I can't interfere or make any rulings.
Come on, doc,
I've got a sick tree back here.
Come on, you too.
She's blond, she's engaged.
Come on, sugar!
- Got your bracelet right here.
- What's the matter?
Come on, Little Red Riding Hood.
You're really gonna enjoy this.
How about this patient, huh, doc?
You're really gonna enjoy it here, doc.
Come on, men. What about 0930?
All right, take out the blue bands.
Let's go!
Change to the blue armband!
What about the prisoners?
Sorry, major. We can't spare any men to look after prisoners.
You coming?
- Is he trying to kill us?
- We must be going 120.
He's gonna squash us in this sardine can.
You want to be there by 0930, don't you?
Yeah.
- Pulling back the map reference,
That's Blue Force crew.
Call in company orders and hit them when they reach crossroads.
Hello, Able 3.
Don't worry, Bill. They called for the ambulance.
- It's gonna be all right.
- Yes, it will.
It's gonna be all right.
I want a strike on Hill 80 between them at 1400 hours.
Move them up to the base of the hill and keep their heads down.
Well, thanks very much, colonel.
It's been very instructive.
I think I'll take a little ride now and get the overall picture.
Yes, sir, thank you.
Move it over. Give them room.
Forward observation report.
Blue Force tanks approaching... airfield at map reference...
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Come on.
Watch out for the ambulance!
There he is. The old man.
Come on, observers!
Major Reisman's compliments, sir.
Hey, major. What do you think about that one, major?
I didn't wanna tell you before because
I thought it might make you nervous.
After our last little party, the generals were all in favor... of sending you back to finish your sentences.
- Or get hung.
- Or get hung.
Or get hung.
But I made a deal with them.
Knocking off Breed's headquarters is what got you guys off the hook.
You weren't really worried, were you, major?
No, not much, he wasn't.
But we still have one operation to go.
If you guys foul up on this one, none of us will ever play the violin again.
Because up until now, it's all been a game.
But as of tomorrow night, it's gonna be the real thing.
If you want to know how real,
I'll tell you.
It's my guess the lot of you guys won't be coming back.
But there's no sense in squawking about that.
Because the Army never did love you.
Besides, you all volunteered, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, that's more than I did.
Sergeant Bowren.
Look, I know we've been over this a thousand times... but a lot can go wrong.
We gotta be prepared to improvise.
So let's see what happens if everything goes right. Ready?
- One.
- At the roadblock, we've just begun.
- One.
- At the roadblock, we've just begun.
- Two.
- The guards are through.
- Three.
- The major's men are on a spree.
- Four.
- Major and Wladislaw through the door.
- Five.
- Pinkley stays out in the drive.
- Six.
- The major gives the rope a fix.
- Seven.
- Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven.
- Eight.
- Jiminez has got a date.
- Nine.
- The other guys go up the line.
- Ten.
- Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen.
- Eleven.
- Posey guards points five and seven.
- Twelve.
- Wladislaw and major go down to delve.
And where's Donald Duck?
Donald Duck's down at the crossroads with a machine gun.
And he'd better not be asleep, or we'll all be in trouble.
- Thirteen.
- Franko goes up without being seen.
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.
- And?
- Mayonnaise cuts the cable...
Franko cuts the phone.
- Fifteen.
- Franko goes in... where the others have been.
- Sixteen.
- We all come out like it's Halloween.
And kill every officer in sight.
Ours or theirs?
Well, let's start off with theirs, huh?
Let's take it again from the top, without the ad-libs.
- All right, one.
- Down the roadblock, we've just begun.
- Two.
- The guards are through.
- Three.
- The major's men are on a spree.
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.
- And?
- Mayonnaise cuts the cable...
Franko cuts the phone.
- Fifteen.
- Franko goes in... where the others have been.
- Sixteen.
- We all come out like it's Halloween.
Seventeen?
Seventeen. D-day.
We get out as best we can and make our way to the coast.
And hope that the entire invasion hasn't been a total disaster.
Otherwise, we got a long swim home.
How much longer, major?
I'll ask the driver.
You're not worried about jumping at night, are you?
Getting back.
Ready.
Cargo.
Go.
- Where have you been? We're late.
- We've been looking for Jiminez.
- And?
- We found him hung up in an apple tree.
- His neck's broken.
- You mean he's dead?
That's exactly what I mean.
- This far.
- Yeah.
All right, Franko, now you know why we all checked out on that rope, huh?
Gilpin, number eight.
Gilpin, did you hear me?
- Eight.
- Gilpin's got a date?
- Fourteen.
- Zero hour.
- And?
- Gilpin cuts the cables...
Franko cuts the phone.
- Let's go.
- What a great way to start out, huh?
- Yeah.
So far, so good, major.
Where are those guys?
Here they come.
Let's go.
Come on, Pinkley, let's go.
It's just like the major said it would be.
Yeah, really some spread, ain't it?
There they go now.
- No blackout?
- Think they're expecting us?
Hey, the silencer!
Let's go.
"Radio room."
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
I don't know how many
Germans we'll kill... but we're gonna make an awful lot of noise.
Hey, do you believe in stuff like that?
Oh, I don't know, can't hurt nothing.
I don't think I believe in stuff like that.
- So, how's your German holding up?
- Oh, man, I don't know.
You know those two guys walking down the stairs?
I couldn't understand a word they said.
- Just act mean and grunt, huh?
- Yeah.
Okay, Room 11.
So?
You go first, I'll carry the bags.
We'll set it up here.
- They should've been here by now.
- Yeah.
Guard!
I left the rope.
Hold it.
Idiot.
- Do it, Polack!
- Shut up.
Hurry up.
Now.
Now.
Ready for the turkey shoot?
I wish I could read this.
I think it's dirty.
Hey! What are you doing?
Franko and the others are still down there. Come on!
Hey, Maggott.
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of sight.
Wolfgang?
Wolfgang?
Wolfgang?
Scream.
Scream.
Scream, you slut.
Sprechen, you harlot.
Scream.
Radio room.
Blow it! Blow it!
- Hey, what's going on?
- Shut up.
It's Judgment Day, you sinners.
Come out.
Come out, wherever you are.
Come out.
Come out.
Now!
- You didn't think about that, did you?
- They gotta breathe.
You got the grenades?
Right. Right, sir.
We got enough here to blow up the world.
What are we gonna do about them?
We'll feed the French and kill the Germans.
- Franko, cover that corner.
- What happened?
They're locked in the bunker. There's gotta be some air vents. Take a look.
All right, bring your grenades!
Over here!
I'll take them.
Here they are.
Take it down there.
Bowren, get Vladek out here.
Where's that coming from?
Come on, Vladek, we need you.
Come on, come on.
Franko! Get over here and see if you can start one of those trucks!
Wladislaw, Jefferson. Get the lids off those other ventilators.
You know what you gotta do, so do it.
Hurry up!
All right, you Frenchies, beat it.
No, it's all right. It's all right. Go on.
Get back up there and cover that bridge!
Move it!
Help Bowren!
There they are!
Hurry it up. Posey's got trouble!
Get one of those trucks started!
No, no, no. Leave the pins in.
The pins in, huh?
Bowren, get some gasoline.
Some gasoline?
Are you sure?
You want to ask Pinkley and Vladek?
Now, get going!
Yes, sir.
Sawyer, Lever, cover that bridge!
Do you believe these guys?
They keep these things locked.
Keep looking!
The other road! The other road!
Come on, baby.
Where are you, baby?
Let's go!
Move over.
Move over!
Wladislaw... get Vladek out of there, huh?
Another flare! Another flare!
Come on, you...
Jefferson! When I give you the signal... set them off one, two, three, four, and get the hell out of there.
We'll wait for you at the bridge.
- Right?
- Right.
Let's go!
Come on, let's go.
Come on, hurry up!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Jefferson, set them off!
Get that thing out of here or we'll all go up!
Let's go.
They're not gonna make it.
We'll get a boat and get out the other side. Come on, let's go.
All right, blow it!
Remember, Jefferson, 20 seconds!
Run!
- Faster, faster.
- Come on! Come on!
Jefferson faster.
Come on, Jefferson. Run!
- Go!
- Hurry up!
- Come on, move!
- Come on, come on.
- It's gonna blow!
- Come on!
Come on, Jefferson!
Jefferson!
Come on, start.
It won't start! It won't start!
The bastard won't start!
All right, get in!
Shift! Shift it, shift it!
We made it!
We made it. Those stupid bastards, we made it!
Come on! Keep shooting!
Major!
Among the many reports of the raid
on the chateau near Rennes...
perhaps the most objective
is the one by General Worden...
in which he states:
"We are recommending that those
members of the group known...
as 'The Dirty Dozen ' who survived
this operation...
should have their records
amended to indicate...
that they are being returned
to active duty at their former ranks.
And that the next of kin of those
prisoners who were killed be advised...
that they lost their lives in the line of duty. "
You did a fine job, major.
I'll see you around.
You did a good job, soldier.
Hurry up and get well.
We need men like you out there.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Killing generals could get to be a habit with me.
Franko, V.R.
Vladek, M.
Jefferson, R. T.
Pinkley, V.L.
Gilpin, S.
Posey, S.
Sawyer, S.K.
Lever, R.
Bravos, T.R.
Jiminez, J.P.
Maggott, A.J.
They lost their lives
in the line of duty.

Come on, hurry. Let's go.
Come, come on. Come on.
You are not leaving.
Why won't you understand that I have to go where my husband goes?
I suppose that even if he jumped off a cliff you'd have to follow him.
Yes.
You see, I love him very much.
Love. How much good will your love do you...
...in the middle of a wilderness surrounded by Indians?
What kind of a frontier woman do you think you'll make?
You've never had to cook or wash or keep house in your life.
Your father and I saw to that.
I can learn, Mother.
- And that husband of yours.
- Mother.
Yancey Cravat. That isn't even a name.
It is my name now.
What is a lawyer going to do on a homestead?
If only you'd let me say something.
If Yancey says he can do it, he can.
I warned you when you married him, a man you had only known three months...
...that you'd live to regret it.
I will never regret it. Not for one second.
There's never been anything like it in the history of the world.
Imagine, a whole territory settled in one afternoon.
Whole cities springing up in one hour.
I'll bet you there's thousands of people on that borderline right now...
...today, right this moment, steaming and waiting for that opening gun next week.
Now, can you imagine it?
Can you just imagine it?
Look. Here.
Here is the Oklahoma territory...
...over 2 million acres of the finest land the crow ever flew over.
And here, see...
...that's all divided up into quarter sections.
Like that. That's... Um...
Now.
Here are the soldiers all lined up in a row.
Here they are all lined up...
...to see that nobody gets into that territory before they're supposed to.
Now, now here...
Here come the settlers.
Here they come, thousands of them.
Thousands of them, from all over.
And here. Here you are, honey.
Here they come.
And they're just so anxious.
They're just starving for a piece of that land.
They're starving for it.
Matter of fact, they'd fight for it.
They'd even die for it.
Well, how about that?
Charley, hand me a few more of those settlers, will you?
That's a boy.
And give some to the children too, huh?
Oh, Sabra.
Oh, my Sabra.
Here. Have yourself a settler, huh?
Mr. Yancey!
Better not forget this, Mr. Yancey.
You might need it one day.
Yeah.
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, my dear.
I envy you.
All right.
Now, remember what I told you, dear.
A little tighter.
Both reins.
That's right.
And I'll follow you.
You all ready?
- Yes.
Good luck, darling.
Mother. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Yancey, it's getting awfully lonesome back here.
Well, we'll be stopping right up here ahead, honey.
That's very pretty.
Where did you learn that?
In the old country.
What does it mean?
"If God keeps me alive, believe you me...
...I will take care of no one but thee. "
Darling, how many times you walked towards me...
...I looked at you, wanted you?
How many times you didn't even look at me?
And I wanted you.
- Yes, sir, she sure looks good from here.
- Ha-ha-ha.
What are you laughing at?
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Let's start sailing.
What do you want with me?
- Wants to know what we want.
- What do we want?
Anybody who wears anything...
- Oh, look at this. Look at this.
- ... as pretty as that ain't no pea patch.
Get up.
I ought to shoot your ears off, scaring my wife like that.
Cim. Hey, what's the matter with you?
Don't you recognize me? The Kid?
I recognized you.
Oh, Cim, how was we supposed to know it was your wife?
Somebody else's wife, everything would've been all right.
I'm sorry. We didn't mean anything.
Well, I guess there's no harm done.
- How are you, boy?
- Just great.
- Who's this?
- It's Wes.
- I'm Pat Jennings' boy.
- Jennings.
- Remember Hoss?
- Yeah, don't tell me.
- This is what's-his-name, uh... Barry.
- Barry.
Ned Barry's boy, yeah.
Say, last time I saw this fellow, he was just about so high.
We heard you got killed in a gunfight out in California, remember?
I used to work for this boy's daddy as a ranch hand.
How nice.
What are you boys doing?
Devilmenting around?
We're kind of riding around.
I used to ride the old bag line myself...
...living off the old hospitality of the South as it were.
Well, you had your breakfast?
- No, we ain't ate yet.
- Fine.
Honey, you better lay out a little more food and cups and saucers and all.
We're gonna have some guests for breakfast.
Just turn around and step over there...
...while the little lady gets out of the water, right over there.
The first of you bindlestiffs that looks around...
...you'll get the meat end of this rifle right between the eyeballs.
- All right, you can get out now, honey.
- Get out?
If you stay in there, you're gonna catch cold.
You want them to stay and have breakfast with us?
- Well, these are my friends.
- Oh-!
Sir, we really gotta be going.
No fooling, we're late now.
Where are we going?
Listen, ma'am. Uh...
I'm awful sorry we, uh, discommode you.
I hope you won't hold no, uh, you know, grievance against old Cim.
I tell you, when I was a little buster, no bigger than a rabbit...
...I used to follow Cim around everywhere he went.
He spit on a stump, I spit on a stump.
And all I ever wanted was just to grow up and be like him.
And so if I've done anything at all, anything to come between you and him, uh...
All right. All right.
- Skimmeroot.
- Ha-ha-ha!
Honey, I'm afraid you hurt my friends' feelings.
I hurt their feelings?
I'm afraid you did. Come on, dear.
In the West, you never turn a man away without a hot meal in his stomach.
It just isn't done.
Oh, well, you'll learn.
There we go. There, now.
Come on, now, you're still not scared, are you?
No, I'm not scared.
I'm just frozen and cold.
All right, dear.
And don't you dare talk to me again until I tell you you can.
All right, I won't talk to you anymore.
Not until you tell me.
You all right now?
No.
What happened?
What's the matter? You lose your horse?
Never had none.
Where you from?
Missouri.
You mean to tell me you walked all the way from Missouri?
I guess so. I'm here.
Suppose you get in out of the rain and ride with us.
- You wouldn't object to that, would you?
- I wouldn't, but maybe you might.
I got my family with me.
Oh, we'll make room.
- Yancey Cravat.
- Tom Wyatt.
Hi, Tom. This is my wife here, Sabra.
Sabra, this is Tom Wyatt.
How do you do, Mr. Wyatt?
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.
That's my family.
Now, what was that you said about making room?
Well, I said we could, I guess we can.
I guess.
Come on, we got a ride.
Let's get out of the rain.
Come on, you itty-bitty.
Pa got a ride for us.
- Itty-bits, you'll fall.
We got a ride.
- What is it, Tom? What is it?
Ha-ha-ha.
This is my wife, Mrs. Wyatt.
And this is my children. Janet.
- You wanna meet my children?
- No, never mind for now.
Suppose you take this wagon.
Listen, you take my wagon, and you children...
...half of you get in the other wagon and half of you get in this wagon, all right?
That's right.
Come on, you itty-bits.
Go get in his wagon...
...before this poor man change your mind.
Which ones go in which wagon?
It doesn't matter.
Just so we're half and half.
Hold them up there, boys.
Man, ain't that something?
- Hey.
- Get on back to the line.
I guess we made it, Sarah.
I guess we did.
Hey, you.
Hey, you can't stop there.
Hey. Yancey.
Hi, Ned. How are you, boy?
Fine, fine. Ma'am.
Haven't seen you since you were selling
Indian ponies to the cavalry.
Not in that business anymore?
No, I gave that up.
It's really something, isn't it?
Yeah, just one big headache to me...
...trying to keep all them too-sooners out of there.
I sure hate to think about tomorrow.
Look at all of them.
We haven't got enough land for one-third of them.
There's gonna be an awful lot of mad and disappointed people...
...to say nothing of the dead ones.
You mean all this land and there won't be enough?
No, honey. The land around here ain't fit to raise goats on.
But over there, right over there...
...just about, oh, I'd say about 10 or 15 miles...
...you never seen such rich farming and grazing land.
That's the land we'll have to run for.
Hey, I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
Hey, Ike, where you been?
Where you been?
Hey, you're all dressed up like a prune picker.
Have you seen Sam Pegler?
There's 10,000 people down there and he's one of them.
Wait till you meet Sam, he's really something.
He must be something.
Yancey won't stop talking about him.
How about taking our picture?
Take my picture.
All right. All right.
We'll make a nice, big group shot.
All right, now, watch the birdie.
Take our picture.
- Take my picture.
- Take our picture.
My bird's kind of stringy.
How's yours, pretty?
Don't blame it on the bird.
Even butter's stringy to you with those horrible, misfitting, store-bought teeth.
Mike, you old frog-sticker.
How you doing?
Well, I'll be. Yancey.
Have you seen Sam Pegler anywhere?
Not yet, but he'll be here.
Hey, Ike, look who's here.
I seen him this afternoon.
How are you, Cim?
I'm fine. Hi, Grat.
- You didn't waste any time, did you?
- Come and see me.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Where do you know these people?
- You know everybody.
- Oh, honey, they-
Hey, Cimarron.
- Hey, Dixie, there's Cimarron.
- Yancey, how are you? Where you been?
Where?
Who's that?
Oh, uh, it's nothing, honey, they're sort of friends of mine, ahem, you know.
Well, he could have wrote you at least.
Uh... Well, I'll explain it all to you someday, dear.
Pins. I have pins, needles.
Calico. Hamburg lace.
Hey, mister, mister, come over here.
Come here.
Have you any candy for the children?
Candy for the children? Plenty.
Help yourself.
There's all kinds of candy there.
There's red and green and yellow and licorice.
There's licorice down below.
Did you get it? Huh?
You look so young, madam.
How long have you been married?
Two weeks.
Two weeks?
- Lady, the candy is on the house.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Wait a moment, mister, no, listen.
These are not our children.
Honey, it's all right.
Hey, Tom, that's Pegler's wagon up ahead.
I'll see you there.
Come on, buddy, let's go there.
Indians got as much right to be here as anybody else.
Sam Pegler,
I want you to stay out of this fight.
Somebody's got to help him.
- Look at those fellers. That's a darn shame.
- Terrible.
Look at the baby.
Back to the reservation.
Send them back where they come from.
Wait a minute. This fellow's got as much right here as you have.
You stay out of this, old man.
Shame's on you. Well, I-
Stop it!
All right, break that fight up.
Separate those men.
What's this commotion all about?
This Indian's got just as much right to be here as anybody else.
Let me have your papers.
Now, this man has been legally registered.
And according to law, he's got as much right to make this land run as you have.
You heard what I said.
Now, go on, get back to your wagons.
The Indian stays.
Now, go on, break this up.
Go on. Now, move along, everybody.
Go on, move along.
I wanna tell you something, old man.
You try to run that newspaper of yours up here...
...the same way you did down in Texas...
...you're gonna get buried here.
And I don't care who your friends are.
Let's go, Millis.
Man, you really are something, Sam.
- You can't keep out of trouble, can you?
- Now, why should I?
Why should you?
Honey, this is Sam Pegler.
This is my wife, Sabra.
Your what?
Well, ma'am, I'm pleased to meet you.
Mavis, come look who's hooked himself a wife.
Oh, you poor girl.
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute.
Just don't pay no attention to her, because...
This is Jessie Rickey.
- How do you do?
- You know what he is?
He's one of the best printers in the business, when he's sober he is, that is.
Well, you know the last time he smiled, it caused an earthquake.
- You done pretty good in that fight.
- How do you mean, pretty good?
He almost got himself killed, risking his life for an Indian.
Sorry.
Suppose we, uh, give this fellow a hand here and get this wagon turned up.
Sir, do you mind if we help you?
Why don't you get on that side here.
- Sam Pegler.
- Yancey Cravat.
- Sol Levy.
- My wife.
Tom, suppose you go down to that end.
Now, watch it when-
- Tom Wyatt.
- Jessie Rickey.
Sam, take good care of it.
Yeah, I'll watch it.
That's my wife.
All right, let's go all together. Heave!
- Why do they call you Cimarron?
- It's a long story.
He's mean and wild and crazy.
That's what the word means.
Come on, you wanna make her think she married a wildcat?
She didn't marry a scat rabbit.
Do you know what you married?
A lunatic.
- He don't know what he wants.
- I do.
- Do you now? Now, do you?
- Of course I do.
How many things you been already?
A gambler, a gunman, a lawyer.
Now you wanna be a farmer. Bah.
No. I don't wanna be a farmer, I wanna be a rancher.
- I give you just two months.
- That's different.
You'll be pulling your hair out with both hands.
No. No, not this time.
This is the first time in my life
I've seen a piece of land and I said:
"This is what I want. "
More than anything, this is what I want.
You know how long
I've been dreaming about that land?
You know how long?
Ever since I used to ride herds through this country.
I used to lean down, pick up a big handful of that earth and smell it.
It was so rich.
You know how you do?
It smelled so rich you felt like you just...
You just throw out a handful of seeds and a whole crop of corn would sprout up.
Ten feet high.
That's what I wanna do.
I wanna grow my own food and raise my own cattle.
Now, just a minute.
There's only one thing wrong with that little dream of yours.
Corn just don't pop up 10 feet tall.
No, it's gotta have plowing and planting and weeding and watering.
- And then along comes a drought. Ruined.
- Shh.
- All right.
- And as for that fictional cattle-
All right. All right. Ha-ha-ha.
Say, you really are something, young fellow.
Come on, little lady.
We've got a rough day ahead.
I'll get out the bedroll here.
Good night. Good night.
Oh, ma'am, I don't want you to think we meant nothing by what we were saying.
- We were just joshing him.
- Oh, I know.
Oh, there is just one thing, though.
You see, we kind of raised that lunatic.
He's kind of like a son.
Well, we never had any children of our own.
And I was just thinking, you being his wife and all...
...maybe you could talk him into trying the newspaper business.
It isn't so much for ourselves.
Well, now, wait a minute, Mother.
That enters into it.
You see, a man hates to work...
...and have everything that he stood for just disappear.
- Well, it's just that-
- Kind of like to pass it on to somebody.
Yeah. You see, we need somebody to leave things to.
- Sam.
- And-
Listen, how many times...?
You never give up, do you?
I told you
I don't like the newspaper business.
I just don't like this business of being a crusader all the time.
- It's an embarrassing thing, you know.
- Who's a crusader? I'm not a crusader.
You are, Sam, you are a crusader.
Isn't that right?
Every time some unpopular cause comes along...
...old Sammy gets himself right in the middle on the wrong side.
Somebody's got to.
- That's what I'm talking about.
That's exactly what I mean.
No, sir, you're not gonna catch me spending my time-
Wasting my time behind a desk.
Just look out there, look at all those people.
Isn't that a sight? And every one of them, every one of them have some sort of dream.
What's the use of any of us being here...
...if we're not chasing some sort of a dream of some kind?
There they are out there.
Good men, bad men, lawmen, gunmen, horse thieves, wanted men...
...men not wanted so much by anybody or anything, anyplace.
But they've all got that dream in their head.
They've all got that new life they're hoping to lead sometime.
And how many of them...
...four out of five, ain't gonna make no life...
...ain't gonna find no land, no nothing?
That's good old Mavis.
I don't know how you put up with her all these years.
Well, somebody's got to.
I know. Come on, honey.
Good night. Good night, Sam.
Good night.
I love you.
Stand by.
You know, you're welcome to use one of my horses.
The way I ride, I'd never be able to hold my own against these boys.
Don't worry about it, honey.
We come this far, didn't we?
I didn't come this far to get done out of my land.
Bye, Pop.
- I'll get my land somehow.
- Bye, Pa.
And what's gonna happen if you miss that stagecoach?
Well, I'll worry about that when I come to it.
All right, now.
Suppose you take this along just in case, huh?
- Thanks, for everything.
- Good luck, Tom.
Come on, itty-bit, go back to the wagon now.
Hope you get your land.
Pa's gotta go.
You just stay with your ma, now.
How on earth are we ever gonna find you?
You all stay with the folks. I'll find you.
Let's say goodbye to Daddy.
- Bye. Bye. Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
- Yancey, can you see our land from here?
- No.
It's in that direction, though.
Way out there there's a big grove of trees, and then there's this gully.
On the other side of the gully, there's this big hill...
...and on top of that hill, there's some of the finest grazing land you ever saw.
You best come in town with us.
- You mean that the town's already set up?
No, no, no, they have it, uh...
These certain sections plotted off into, like, town lots.
Is that right? And all the rest is divided up into farms.
- One hundred and sixty acres apiece.
- Yeah.
- And it's free?
- Yes.
All this wonderful land just here to take.
They're about ready.
I'm gonna saddle up.
Huh? Oh.
What a foolish sight. An old character like you racing like a tomcat.
Never mind the lecture.
Help me get this rheumatic old knight on his wooden charger.
I said, take your hands off me, both of you.
Since when do I have to have help getting up on a wagon?
Come on, Sir Galahad, upsy-daisy.
- Come on, you.
- Ahh...
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Take good care of that wildcat, Sabra.
He won't be easy to tame.
I will.
Hey, Dixie, where'd you get them pants?
Hey, Dixie.
Hello, Dixie. You racing for land?
I already know the land I want.
Hey, Dixie. Hey, Dixie.
Hey, Dixie.
Yancey, who is she?
Well, I gotta tell you all about that someday, honey.
Now, look, you stay back here till the race gets started, right?
Now, you come on, itty-bits, get in that wagon.
Come on, get out of the way of them horses.
You come with me, baby. Get over there.
Get up there, Nellie.
Never mind about that thing, just get up.
I got two hands and I can't handle all of you.
Well, we're off to the hunt.
Exciting, what?
What? Cecil, button your duster.
Yeah, or I'll button it for you.
- I got money, I got money.
Okay, get on the back if you can.
I paid.
I gave the man up there the money.
Let me on. Let me on here.
Get ready.
It's Pa. I think it's Pa. He didn't make it.
Is Pa hurt? Is Pa hurt?
I'll do it myself.
I got to do it myself.
I got to do it myself.
Hey, soldiers, I crossed the line.
I crossed that line, didn't I?
I crossed that line.
I got my land. I got my land.
I got my land.
Nellie. Go, girls.
Nellie.
Hyah! Hyah!
Get him.
Aah! Help, Yancey!
This is my land now.
Well, how about that?
Yeah, how about that?
Yeah, the land is so rich out here, all you gotta do is toss out a handful of seeds...
...and up pops a corn patch 10 feet tall.
So I'm told.
- Now, come on, Dixie.
- Don't come near me.
So help me, I'd sooner put a bullet through you than not.
You know, I think you would too.
Yancey.
Yancey, did you get the land?
Well, I didn't exactly get the land I wanted, but, uh, well, I got to thinking.
Uh... After all, we're not farmers, so, what would we want a farm for?
But...
It's not worth it.
What do you wind up with?
I'm a woman.
Where are my children?
I'm a woman. Where's my house?
I'm a woman.
Where's my man?
You, my rheumatic old knight.
Who's gonna climb up on our wheezy old charger...
...and lead us into the thick of things?
What good is it without you?
Anything?
I'm lonesome.
Already, I'm just plain lonesome.
Come on.
Hurry, let's get these claims.
I got mine.
You gotta line up.
I'm in a hurry.
Line up to file claims for your land.
First come, first served.
- Line up, don't block the door.
Let's go, hurry up.
Uh...
Jessie, suppose you stay and, well, you help me run the paper.
Are you sure you want to do it?
Somebody has to.
My, what a lot we've seen together, you and me and this, this wicked old...
Well...
I wish you would change your mind and stay with us.
No, Sam left a lot of things he was fixing to do...
...and I might just as well get going.
Yancey, you're getting right smack in the middle of things.
You'll only end up getting yourself killed too.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, I better get myself situated.
Yeah, I guess we all better.
You know where to find me.
Listen, everything will be all right.
Honey, you stay here.
I have something to attend to.
Yancey.
- Yancey, Yancey, where are you going?
- Before you know I'm gone, I'll be back.
Yancey, please, don't go looking for trouble. Please.
There are things a man has to do a woman doesn't understand.
- It's different here.
- Suppose he kills you.
What's going to happen to me?
What can I do here, all by myself?
Yancey, please.
Don't go looking for trouble, please.
Oh, please.
You must help me, please.
I'm so afraid.
I don't know what to do.
It's this place.
Is this where we're going to settle down and raise a family?
- It's all right, please.
- Oh, darling, I'm so...
- I hate to be afraid.
- Oh, please.
Sabra, please, it's my fault. It's my-
- I wanna make you happy.
- I've gotta take care of you more.
But just help me. Tell me what to do.
- I love you. Shh.
- Please don't leave me.
Wait, darling, wait, please.
Listen. Listen, I need you far more than you need me.
- You help me. You help me, darling.
- I just love you so much.
We just gotta be patient with each other, that's all.
Yes.
What are we going to do? Hmm?
We're gonna go home.
- Yes.
- Oh, no.
Oh, no.
We came to stay, didn't we?
And we are going to stay.
- No?
- You. Oh...
Sabra. Sabra, over here.
- Sabra, when's the baby due?
How are you?
- Well, a couple of weeks from now.
- You poor thing.
Come on. Take a blow there.
- No, Kid.
- Come on.
- One, two, three, four...
- Kid, no!
- No, I don't wanna go.
- Walk it out.
I'm gonna shoot the bottles out of his hands.
- I don't want- No.
- Take bets now, I've got $5.
- I got $50 say you don't.
- Fifty?
We ain't seen $50 at one time in our lives.
- Anyone could take all or a piece of it.
I'll take all.
Just one thing.
I don't see any point in killing a white man.
Hey, Moses. Yeah, you.
Or is it Izzy?
If you're talking to me, the name is Sol-
Stand still.
Hold up your arms.
When I speak, you jump.
You hold up your arms or I'll cut you from end to end.
Let's shoot.
Hey, Moses, don't you worry about a thing.
All right, everybody, clear out.
Clear out back there.
I gotta see what I'm shooting at.
Good night in the morning.
You again, ma'am?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't you "ma'am" me.
You bunch of good-for-nothing loafers.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, playing with guns.
- You think they're toys?
- Sabra. Sabra, darling.
Take care of her, please, Sol.
Take a look, Millis. Millis!
Worth twice the price to see his face when those bottles broke.
Oh, if I ever see a guy that was scared, he was it.
I never seen anything so funny in my life.
There you go, Joe.
Get your money, men.
- You the one that did the shooting?
- Well, now, look who's here.
What's the matter, you got no white-men friends?
Now, I'm not gonna ask you again.
Was it you or wasn't it?
As a matter of fact it wasn't, but don't let that stop you.
I done it, Cim. I was the one.
What, are you gonna write that up in your paper?
I'll tell you, we'll really give you something to write about.
- Won't we, fellas?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What are you doing? I'm not a child.
You ain't no liquor-bellied saddle tramp, neither, like you're trying to be.
You think that's being tough?
Think that's being a man?
What are you doing?
Treating me like a child.
I don't want you hanging around with that crowd no more.
I'll get you in a hotel, give you a job on my newspaper.
- Wait, now, who do you think you are?
- Your friend, for one thing.
Think your daddy would be proud, the way you're gambling, spitting and drinking?
I ain't nothing.
You think I'm something, but I ain't.
I promised your father
I'd look out for you.
What if I help you out?
Send you back East to school?
Would you try to make something of yourself?
- No, Cim, I'm nothing.
- You better make up your mind, boy.
You go kill yourself the way your daddy did.
Nobody's gonna care.
And nobody's gonna stop you.
You know something?
I think if you put your mind to it, you could make something of yourself.
You hear me?
Maybe I have faith in you.
Oh, don't, Cim.
Just don't have faith in me, that's all.
- Please, don't have faith in me.
- Just think it over.
You just think it over.
Hey, Wes, Hoss.
Hey, skimmeroot! I'll see you, Cim.
Skimmeroot!
That Indian woman, what does she want?
Uh...
Honey, uh, there's a little something
I have to do.
- It's, uh, you know, I won't be very long.
- Darling, supper is ready.
Well, suppose you keep it warm for me.
Before you know I'm gone, I'll be back.
Stay with her until I get back, Jessie.
All right, hurry it up. Get him up there.
Back away. Back off.
Hah!
Mr. Jessie.
Mr. Jessie, please, would you get Sol to get Mrs. Wyatt?
- Yancey hasn't come back yet.
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.
- Are you sure?
I'm all right.
Let him hang.
He stole one of my horses.
Now we wanna see the rest of the Indians watch him.
You heard what I said.
I heard you.
I was against it, Yancey.
I told the Indian he wouldn't be safe here.
I didn't think they'd go this far.
Why isn't Yancey back yet?
You got no call to worry about Yancey.
He'll take care of hisself.
I'm really scared of everything.
Well, why shouldn't you be?
Now, you drink this now.
Come on.
Pretty good whisky.
Ain't gonna do you no harm.
It won't be as terrible as everybody says, having a baby?
- That one hurt, didn't it?
- Just a little.
Well, it's supposed to hurt a little, along about this time.
- Here, drink it.
- More?
Good for you.
Nothing for you to do now but lie back and enjoy it.
What are they laughing so much?
What is there to laugh at at a time like this?
- Don't you drink?
- Not when I'm having a baby.
What are you so nervous?
You'd think you had 10 babies already, you wouldn't be nervous.
I'm not nervous, just thirsty.
No.
Cimarron.
What kind of a name is that?
Yancey insisted on it.
- What if he's a girl baby?
- A girl?
- Yancey would send her right back.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I bet he would.
I can't have a girl.
No? Well, that's what I said.
And I got eight girls.
I've got eight of them.
Gentlemen, you're fathers.
- Yancey, what...?
- Shh. Shh.
It's all right, baby. It's all right.
Shh. There.
Oh, my darling.
- Hey, Tom.
- How are you, Yancey?
Hey, that's quite a contraption you got there.
- It look anything like it ought to look?
- Well, how ought it to look like?
Here's a picture in the magazine.
Where? That it?
How about that?
You really done it, huh?
- Seven hundred feet down now.
- Yeah?
And I ain't found enough oil to grease a fiddle.
Yancey, for once I'm afraid
I don't think too much of your advice.
I could have stuck those Eastern dudes with this whole useless farm at $25 an acre.
You wait a minute, Tom.
I figured those Eastern dudes you talk about.
They're not gonna just give their money away.
For something they don't want on top of this ground...
...there must be something underneath.
Yeah, but how far underneath?
I don't know how far down...
...but look, if you strike water, you'll still be ahead.
- I'll strike China first.
- Ha-ha.
Look, I'll tell you how you gotta figure it, Tom.
If you weren't sitting around digging for oil, then what would you be doing, huh?
Nothing.
- That's what I mean.
Tom!
- I'll see you, Tom.
- So long, Yancey.
Come on in, it's time to eat.
- Oh, hush, woman.
You come on in now, Tom.
Food's on the table.
- Hi there.
- Hello, Sarah.
- Will you come on in now?
- Hush, woman.
- Come on in now, Tom.
- Oh, hush, talk, talk, talk.
I swear, I think he's gone clean out of his head.
He don't do nothing but stay out here with that thing, whatever it is.
Meantime, the potatoes are rotting in the ground.
Everybody's laughing at the fool.
Oh, hush, woman.
Will you come on in?
I'm gonna throw your chitlins to the hog.
You know what you can do with my chitlins?
Hey, he sure has managed to keep hisself busy...
...these past few years, hasn't he?
You'd think they were hunting a mad dog or something.
Why is it you always have to take the wrong side of everything?
Every paper in the territory has got an editorial.
"The most dangerous public enemy since Billy the Kid. "
Yeah.
" If the territory of Oklahoma is ever going to be made a state...
...these killers must be stopped. "
- Sabra-
- Only you in the world could have the nerve-
You don't understand. You just don't-
Eight innocent people have been killed and how many banks have they robbed?
Yeah.
When I first knew that boy, his father was one of the biggest landowners...
...one of the biggest ranchers in this territory, Jessie.
The government come along and they decide they're gonna break up...
...that grazing land, and give those ranchers three days.
Imagine that.
Three days to get rid of their herds.
You know as well as I do that buyers take advantage of a situation like this.
And in one day, this man loses everything he spent all his life building up.
In just one day.
Now, you know what happened to him, Sabra?
Do you know?
In four months, he was shot for being a cattle rustler.
There, now, supposing, just supposing, Sabra...
...you were 8 or 9 years old, like that boy was.
What do you suppose a thing like that would do to you?
I didn't know that.
Terrible thing is,
I could have helped that boy.
I could've done something for him.
I don't know what, but I...
I just didn't bother. I didn't...
I didn't take the time.
- If you hadn't been so stupid, we-
- What are you bringing that up for?
- I made a mistake.
- You won't listen to nobody, will you?
Every time I bring up the town of Osage, you change the subject on me.
That couldn't have anything to do with Yancey Cravat, could it?
I'm sick of you.
I'm sick of looking at you.
And I'm sick of hearing your voice, and I'm sick of smelling you.
Go where you want to, will you?
Just get away from me.
That's fine with me.
Hoss, you coming with me?
I go with him.
That's good enough.
Wes.
All right.
You wanna get the train?
We'll get the train.
To tell you the truth,
I don't care no more what we do.
Come on, Hoss.
Hey, Dixie.
How are you?
Hi, Dixie.
Pretty nice rig.
I'm looking for a lawyer.
Are you still a lawyer?
Well, I... Uh...
I'm not much of a one anymore,
I'm afraid.
I don't need much of a one.
Right.
In that case, I'm your man.
Here, would you like to sit down?
Well, now, what can I do for you?
Hurry up, Yancey, we'll be late.
Oh, uh, do you mind running along?
I got business to attend to.
It will just take a few minutes.
Would you mind if...? Um-
No, no. I wait for you.
- Honey, honey.
- Yes, you go play.
Cimarron, you can go and play with Ruby in the yard, but don't go out in the street.
Honey.
Uh... Do you mind if we have a little privacy? It...
It's a...
- Well, it's customary, you know.
- But I'm not listening.
Who wants to listen? Go right ahead.
I don't want to listen.
Do you want to listen, Mr. Jessie?
Well, suppose we step outside, hmm?
Look, all I want is some legal papers.
I'm selling the farm.
- Now, can you draw them up for me?
- You're selling the farm?
Just answer me yes or no.
If you can, fine.
If you can't, I'll go someplace else.
Yes, of course,
I can take care of that for you.
Well, here's all the particulars.
You know, who's buying and for how much and all that.
And when you get them done, just bring them out to the farm.
Well, would you believe a human being could have such nerve?
She wants him to draw up the papers for the...
I think it's about time right now that you tell me about this woman.
There's really nothing to expl-
The Cherokee Kid, got him cornered at depot.
Get the Cherokee Kid.
The Cherokee Kid gang.
- Hoss, come back here.
- Hoss.
Cim. Cim, come back.
Cim.
If you hadn't been so stupid, we wouldn't have gotten in this mess.
We shouldn't have come to Osage.
All right, so I didn't figure it right.
Well, we gotta get out of here.
They'll be around us any minute.
Hey, the schoolhouse.
Yeah, they won't figure on shooting us in there.
Go on, all you kids. Get over in that corner.
Go on, get over there.
No. No.
Don't shoot, don't shoot. Are you crazy?
- There are children.
- My boy's in the schoolhouse.
- Get over there.
- Go.
- Hold on.
- Get over there.
- Cover the window!
- Get down. Get down on the floor.
Down, all of you.
All right, it's okay. Stay here.
My boy's in there. Please get my boy.
Take it easy, Johnson.
There's a lot of other kids in there.
Kid, I wanna talk to you.
Keep out of this, Cim, we don't want you in it. Keep out of it.
Don't come any closer!
If you wanna get these kids out of here alive, you drop the rifle.
Drop it!
Now, you get us our horses.
Sol, bring me their horses.
Come on.
Now, you bring them up to the door.
That's far enough.
Now we can get out of here.
- Wes, what are you doing?
- Mommy. Mommy.
- Wes. Wes, leave that girl alone.
- Mommy! Mommy!
- I'm coming out with a kid.
- Mommy! Mommy!
I'm coming out with this kid in front of me.
You're not coming out with any kid.
All right, you kids get out of here, all of you. Come on, move.
I told you not to have faith in me, didn't I?
Didn't I?
Skimmeroot.
You girls like hotcakes, right? Want some?
Careful. Watch it, now.
Want one?
I made it myself, you'll love them.
Have one. You'll like it.
Here's Mrs. Cravat.
She can tell you where Yancey is.
Oh, hey.
Yeah.
Mrs. Yancey Cravat-
- Now, hold on. Just hold on.
- Please.
- Please, one question-
- Hold on, now where's Yancey?
Leave me alone now.
Like I told you, you can read about it in the next issue of the Wigwam.
- Oh, that's not-
- Went for smokes, I guess.
Now, now you stay here.
I come back in a moment.
I just get changed.
There you are.
Everybody's looking for you.
Reporters from New York and every place.
They want to get some pictures of you receiving the checks.
I got them.
Here, darling.
Your reward money.
I don't take money for killing a man.
Then what was your reason for going in there?
I felt responsible.
What about your responsibility to us?
You risk your life for everybody else, any hopeless cause that comes along...
...but you tear up a check that could give Cim a little security for once.
You'd give our boy security by killing another man's son?
Yancey, I'd give anything to have kept you from going through what you did...
...but it's done now, and we might as well be practical, just for once.
Why don't you tear up our bills too?
All of them.
I don't care. Why should I?
Scrape the grubby ends together day by day.
Go ahead. Tear them up.
You wouldn't care if I took that money, huh?
How can I understand a man like you?
- Don't you know that we have a child now?
- Yes, yes.
He needs some money for some education.
He needs some money for some advantages in life.
Oh, but what does that matter to you?
That was his money you tore up.
What is that in you that...?
That hunger, whatever it is, to be there in the middle of any excitement?
You don't know the meaning of responsibility, do you?
What is it you want?
- Did it occur to you that you are wrong?
- Just wait-
No, no.
Everybody else is on the wrong side.
It's that I don't know what it is you want.
- I just want to be like everybody else.
- Yes, all right.
Well, perhaps you and I, we just...
Maybe you didn't think of this.
Maybe you and I see things differently.
Yes. I guess we do.
Know something else?
I don't know, maybe...
Maybe you picked yourself the wrong man.
And for you?
Am I the wrong woman?
I...
I can't please you.
I just can't please you, Sabra.
Son, I hope that someday, when you get to be an old man...
...you'll be able to tell your grandchildren that you saw the day...
...when this town became civilized.
- You understand what I mean?
- Yes, Daddy.
Yes, and that the things that are happening out there now are just...
They just can't happen and won't happen.
And there's something else, and this is even more important.
You listen to your mother.
Because she's the only one who makes sense around here.
You just don't doubt that for one minute, no matter what any...
What anybody says to you.
Now, there.
Let's make out we don't see her.
Now, look at our nice horse.
Our horse.
Yes, our horse.
Here you go. Fix him up.
And I says to myself:
"If I can only get that land, oh, I've got to get that land.
If I can get it, then I'm sure that most of my problems, they'll be...
Well, they'll be solved, you know.
Some way. "
Then I got to thinking that even if I had gotten the land...
...it wouldn't have solved most of my problems at all, really.
Depends on what your problems are,
I guess.
I guess so.
Well, you got the land, it didn't solve all of your problems.
I don't think. Did it?
It solved one thing, though.
It kept you from getting it.
Dixie.
Listen. Listen, now.
Did I ever tell you, did I ever say to you that we were gonna get married...
...and that we were gonna live here together?
- Did I ever? Did I ever s-?
- No. No.
I never did.
You never actually said you wouldn't, neither.
I thought about you a lot, a whole lot.
I love you.
No.
You came here to bring the papers, and you brought them, thank you very much.
Just leave the bill on the table.
A little breeze feels kind of good, huh?
Skimmeroot.
Do you feel better now?
Yeah.
I never could resist a little old hill to holler from.
Any time you wanna borrow my hill to holler from, you just holler away.
As long as I got it.
You do much?
- Hollering?
- Yeah.
Or don't you need to?
Me? I'm done hollered out.
Any ideas?
Oh, yes.
Sure, I've got a lot of ideas.
But a man just can't wear two hats.
No.
Not at the same time.
Well, what do you figure on doing now, Dixie?
Well, I don't know. Go back to what I ran away from, I guess.
You know, there's not much else I can do.
Of course, uh, if I had a man-
Oh, come on, now. Come on, here.
You never tried real hard to get a man, Dixie.
Because all you'd have to do is just bat your eyelashes...
...and you'd cause a stampede.
That's a fact.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, a man can always, uh, buy a new hat...
...if the one he's got don't fit him.
If he wants to.
Who do you think you're fooling?
Yourself?
You're not fooling me.
I know you, I see all the signs.
You left me and you're gonna leave her.
It's just a question of time.
And when you got those jumping meemies of yours like you always do.
I can see it right now on your face.
There ain't no family, no conscience in this world can hold you.
And you know it, don't you?
Tell me to my face I'm wrong.
Maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
Time for school, children.
Everybody in.
School's starting.
Last bell, children. Inside.
I wanna go to school, Daddy.
Oh, you do? Oh, it won't be long until you'll be old enough.
- And then you'll cry to stay home.
- No, he's not gonna cry. Are you, son?
- No, Daddy.
- No, you bet you're not.
Now, well, you look like a real little lady, darling.
You better hurry.
Don't want to start being late the first day.
Come.
Well, I hope she does better than I did in school.
I was kicked out of class the first day...
...for hitting the teacher with a hard-boiled egg.
- I bet you did.
- That's a fact.
- Daddy, look.
- Huh?
They don't want me.
The school board has considered your request on behalf of that Indian girl.
By unanimous decision, your request has been denied.
Meeting is adjourned.
You don't expect me to keep quiet about this, do you?
You can do what you want, Yancey...
...but I gotta tell you, all you'll do is make enemies for yourself.
If you love the Indians so much, you ought to make your living from the Indians.
You start printing nonsense about this and I'll pull out all my advertisements.
- So will a lot of other people I know.
That's right.
Good. Good.
Let's keep our children's blood pure and their heads empty.
Yancey, Yancey.
- Yeah?
Telegram from the news service just come in the depot.
What do we have here?
How about that?
Sabra?
How about that?
"President Cleveland proclaimed the opening of the Cherokee Strip, September the 16th. "
- The Cherokee what?
- Six million acres of land.
That makes that old puny run we were on just look like a Sunday school picnic.
What are you talking about?
Honey, uh...
Honey, don't-
- Please don't say no, yet.
- No.
I don't want to hear it.
Come on. Don't say no until-
Usually, we have a chance-
- We can discuss it, darling.
- I'm not interested.
Please, darling.
Please.
Let's go.
And leave everything?
Just when we were beginning to get a little established?
For what reason?
To start all over again with the dust and the mud and the shooting?
We've got a child now to be responsible for.
I'll tell you what we'll do, then.
All right, fine.
We'll go and we'll sort of take a vacation.
- What kind of a vacation?
- We'll just go and look at it.
This is the most important thing that's happened in the history of the world.
- You won't even go and look at it?
- I don't want to go.
Who's going to take care of Cim and run the newspaper?
All right.
All right, we'll take Cim with us.
- And Jessie, he'll run the newspaper.
- I don't-
- He's done it before.
- I don't even want to discuss it.
- Oh, honey.
- You get that crazy look out of your eyes.
We are not going.
We are not going.
And that's the end of it.
Well, I guess that's the end of it.
I guess, huh?
Come on, Yancey.
We're all waiting on you.
Are you sure you won't change your mind and come with me?
Son, you be real good to your mom, you hear?
Treat her real good, huh?
And I'll bring you something real nice.
Come on, now, don't look so sad.
Before you know I'm gone, I'll be back.
Make way! Move over!
Make way!
I wanna go with my daddy.
I wanna go with my daddy.
I wanna go with my daddy.
If you get shoes for one of them, you gotta get them for all of them.
Don't worry, Sol, I'll pay you.
When my oil well comes in,
I'll pay you double.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take the shoes.
Thank you, Sol.
- Bye, Sol.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Sabra.
- Goodbye, Tom.
And now you.
I don't know, Sabra, you went to the bank and they wouldn't give you the money...
...so now you come to me for it.
Well...
What have you got to put up for security?
If I had something,
I wouldn't have to come to you.
Now, listen, Sabra, friendship is friendship, and business is business.
If you haven't anything to put up...
What's that?
Stem-winding clock?
I'll take the clock.
But that's a cheap watch.
You can buy one anywhere.
What are you talking about?
All my life,
I wanted a nice little clock like that.
You've got the loan,
I've got the security.
It's a deal.
- Close the door.
- Where is it?
On the table.
Cim, it's for you.
- For me?
- Yes, here.
Look.
Look, Ruby. It has my name on it.
It's a present to me from Alaska.
And there's a letter in it too. I'll bet you anything that your daddy's coming home.
I bet you anything.
What is it? A bearskin?
Yes, a lovely bearskin.
- It's a lovely bearskin.
- What am I supposed to do with that?
Now, don't be rude.
You know better than that.
It's not the gift, it's the thought that counts.
Now, be careful with the letter.
There must be a letter somewhere.
I don't see any letter.
Then it's somewhere around.
Oh, boy, look at this.
Boy, look at those teeth.
Oh, God, look at these claws.
Bet he was 8 feet tall.
Reckon he could eat a man.
Give my best to your husband the next time you write to him.
Yes, I will. Thank you.
Do you expect him back soon?
Well, it's hard to say.
He's away on business, as you know.
It's difficult to foresee the complications when you're away on big business.
It must be really big, to keep a man away from home for five years.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Evening.
Sol.
I thought you were a masher.
I am.
Walk you home?
All right.
What do you care?
Let them talk.
I guess one more piece of gossip can't hurt me.
Me? I only wish it was true.
Sol.
Why don't you get married, hmm?
Is that a proposal?
It would be, if I had any sense.
Ah, sense. Ha-ha-ha.
Already I'm finished.
Do you know what water is to fire?
That's what sense is to love.
Some people in love aren't crazy.
Love.
There's love and there's love.
Me? A woman might love.
But Yancey, if you'll excuse the expression...
...there's a man you could love.
Hey, Sol.
Oh...
Sol.
Thanks for the hat, I love it.
Isn't it a lollapalooza?
I'll, uh, see you later on.
Sol.
Well, listen, women...
It all comes out in the wash.
How can a woman walk like that?
You'd think she'd be embarrassed.
Listen, you tell me every day,
"It pays to advertise. "
Oh, no.
- Sol?
- Hmm?
Can I ask you a favor?
You know everything I've got.
Would you-?
- I mean, would you ask your friend?
- No.
You don't even know what I'm going to ask you.
Am I stupid?
Does she know where Yancey is, right?
- What else?
- So she does know.
- You have discussed it with her.
- Please, Sabra, don't ask for trouble.
So she does know.
Well, I better go and ask her myself.
Sabra.
Sabra, you can't.
I bet you I can.
Sabra.
Why don't you come in here? It's quieter.
Hey.
Hey, hey.
- Sit down.
- Here?
Yeah, we can talk in here.
Well...
I had a very good reason all prepared, an excuse for my being here.
But I don't think you'd believe me anyway.
That's good.
You seem to know me and how I operate.
You shouldn't get me confused with them kind you read about in the storybooks...
...you know, with the heart of gold?
If I had a heart of gold,
I'd have sold it long ago.
For twice what it's worth.
I guess you know essentially why I've come here.
I don't know nothing.
You want me to know something, you gotta tell me straight.
I have reason to believe that you know where my husband is.
- And?
- Naturally, I'd like you to tell me.
Where he is?
You're not making it any easier for me, are you?
Why should I?
Well, I haven't heard from my husband-
I mean, I haven't heard from the man in two years.
I don't know whether he's dead or alive.
He ain't dead.
Did he write to you?
Oh. So it ain't just where he is, you wanna know if he wrote me too.
Well, I don't think it's unnatural that I'd be curious.
You women really puzzle me.
You so-called respectable women.
Would you address me with my proper name?
You say anything because you want to?
- Not without worrying what people think.
- I didn't know I was getting a lecture too.
Is it free?
I don't give nothing free.
In that case, I'd better check the price before you continue.
It might not be worth it to me.
Your husband's in Cuba.
Him and two buddies.
He joined the Rough Riders.
Thank you.
Is that all you wanna know?
I'd like to know much more, but I doubt if it's any of my business.
- You really think that?
- No.
But I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of asking.
You know, I've always wondered how come a man like Yancey...
...married a woman like you.
And I think
I'm beginning to understand it.
Do you know also why he left me?
Don't you?
Probably.
I might as well tell you.
He didn't write me.
His buddy Matt did.
That surprise you, my telling you that?
Very much.
Yeah.
Kind of surprises me too.
I doubt if I'd have told you if the situation were reversed.
You know, I'd take him away from you in one second if I thought I could.
I'm glad you put it that way.
Oh, what a shame you don't know the hold you've got on that man.
Oh, I'm not sure of that.
You know, all I keep thinking is this saying I heard once...
...about the woman who is composed of three parts:
One part mother and one part companion...
...and one part, you know.
That.
It's that third part that worries me...
...and it's not because
I wouldn't like to, either.
Well, I'll tell you something, for what it's worth.
I wouldn't worry about that if I was you.
And I'm not exactly an amateur at spotting, you know, who's got what.
You really mean that?
Yeah.
You know, that's about the nicest compliment I've ever got.
Thank you. Good night.
Good night.
Good night. Thank you very much.
Good night.
Mrs. Cravat.
Good evening, Mrs. Lancey.
Good evening, Mrs. Kuye.
Well...
We all feel gay
When Johnny comes marching home
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Go ahead, Cim, find your daddy.
- Daddy.
- Hurry up, Ruby.
Come on, Ruby. Let's find Daddy.
Daddy. Daddy, Daddy.
"Welcome home, Daddy. "
Sabra.
Sabra, please don't be so stubborn.
The whole town is going to be at the train to meet him, it doesn't look nice.
I don't care how it looks.
If Yancey Cravat thinks he can disappear for five years with never a single word...
...and then come back and find me at the station waving a flag...
...and carrying a welcome sign,
I don't know who he thinks he is anyway.
And how he even has the nerve to come back here.
No matter how many Spanish hills he ran up and down.
And if he thinks he can just calmly walk back into my life...
...a person would have to be crazy to forgive an irresponsible, selfish-
And you, you stay right here, now.
Right here.
And you don't move.
And you see what I'm going to tell him.
I want an audience.
I'm telling you.
Yancey's not on this end.
- He ain't in there.
- Well, he's gotta be.
Daddy's not on the train, Uncle Jessie.
Daddy's not on the train!
All right, where is he?
He ain't on the train.
He didn't come back.
Are you sure?
That's him, all right. That's him all over.
You ought to have seen the faces of the committee.
They searched that train high and low.
No sign of him nowhere.
I won't get over it.
My love.
You know, son, I know that I haven't been very much of a daddy to you...
...but I would like to make it up to you, somehow, if you'd let me.
I...
I'd like to make it up to both of you.
Well, you think you'd give your old daddy another chance?
Hmm?
Now, do you think you might squeeze a little smile out for me?
I know I don't deserve one right now, but perhaps you could give me, uh...
...sort of an advance on one you might decide to give me next week.
How about it, son?
Let me in.
Let me in.
It's Tom. It's Tom Wyatt.
Let me in. It's Tom Wyatt.
It's oil! Look at it.
Smell it. Taste it.
Oil. I hit oil.
I hit oil. Oil.
It's oil.
We're rich.
Yeah, I never...
Oh, Lord.
Oh, no.
Well, there goes the money in the cookie jar.
Oh, my. What's so funny about that?
It's okay, Mama,
I'll go to college next year.
It is not funny.
- What do you think of all these statues?
- Wonderful.
Cost me $100,000 just to have them cleaned.
Sit down here, dear.
- May I help you?
- Sabra.
Thank you, Tom.
- Senator, here's one I got in Milan.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Call him a senator, old windbag.
He couldn't senate my Aunt Fanny.
Hors d'oeuvre, madam?
Where did you get them from?
Some little-bitty midget?
When I was poor, I used to have my sandwiches that were that thick.
Look at that.
Make half a dozen, six, seven sandwiches out of one measly piece of bread.
Hi, Yancey.
Hey, Tom.
Hi, folks.
Come here.
You want to hear something funny?
You know why they put that Indian reservation way out there, where they did?
Hi, folks.
Because that ground was so useless...
...they figured it was so worthless that nobody'd know what to do with it.
It'd just be useless.
Well, sir, those 2000 Indians squatting in their rags out there...
...are now just about the richest nation in the whole world.
Yes, sir, they've discovered oil on the reservation. Ha-ha!
How about that, huh?
Well, I call that divine providence, Sabra.
- Isn't that right, Tom?
- It sure is.
Wait till they find out
I got it all sewed up.
I own every drop of oil out there.
Ha-ha-ha.
Have a drink to my new oil field.
Come on, Yancey,
I'll pour you some champagne.
No, thanks.
Come on, Sabra.
Well, I just hope you're satisfied.
Every time I manage to get us socially accepted again in this town...
...you come along and do something against it.
You promised, too, didn't you...
...if you did come, you would behave like a gentleman?
- Didn't you promise me?
- Yes, yes.
What did Tom Wyatt do so terrible, huh?
He must have paid the Indians for their oil rights.
Nobody forced them to sell.
It's purely business, isn't it? Hmm?
I never thought of it quite that way.
I'm sure you didn't.
"Wyatt swindles Indians"?
Yancey, you're crazy.
You can't print this.
I told him I wouldn't run it off.
What's the point of having a newspaper if you can't have fun with it?
- Dad's right, Mother.
- I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to your father.
Now, this is out-and-out libel.
We'll be ruined.
Jessie, I'm gonna tell you something.
You know those Indians up there?
You know they're not gonna get 5 cents?
Not one nickel of all that oil money.
All those politicians and that Tom Wyatt.
Tom Wyatt, I tell you.
But you can't prove it!
I know I can't. I know.
Sabra, I know that I can't prove it.
But I'm gonna tell you-
Son, they don't know that.
Whenever you're dealing with crooks, you know what you have to do?
I mean, if you know you're right?
Well, I tell you, you just stir up a great big fuss, like we're doing right now.
And what happens to those crooks?
They just run.
Yes, sir, they just run just like a bunch of scared jackrabbits.
Yes, sir.
I tell you, we're gonna get that Tom Wyatt out of there...
...and we're going to make those Indians millionaires.
Now, give that a turn, will you, Jessie?
Turn around there.
That's it.
Yes. Yes.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry.
I've got my own skin to save.
Now, wait a minute, Rollins.
How'd they get the news in Washington?
From some little cheap, small-town newspaper?
Washington?
Every newspaper picked it up from the Associated Press.
Well, I ain't through yet.
You'll find there's more than one way
I can milk a bullfrog.
Yancey, look out.
Those crazy Indians.
What do they think, that they own the street?
You'd think one of them would stop and help you, after all you've done for them.
We'll just give it a little push and we'll be in fine shape.
Fellows, would you mind giving me a hand here?
Right.
I better walk.
I got Civic Club due in 10 minutes.
All right, dear. Here we go. Easy.
- Yancey.
- Yeah?
- Yancey.
- Yeah, what?
Congratulations.
- Yeah, what for?
- Lord, where is that darned thing?
Telegram just come in.
Thought maybe you'd like to see it.
They want you to come to Washington, get yourself appointed governor of the-
Oh, here it is. -territory.
Well, how about that?
Must be pretty hard up for politicians if they wanna make you governor. Ha-ha.
You're not joking there, boy.
Train leaves at 7 tonight.
I went around to check it.
Would you mind not telling Sabra about this for a while?
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?
Maybe I don't wanna be the governor.
- I don't get along very good with politicians.
- All I done was give you the telegram.
If you wanna keep it from her, that's your neck, not mine.
Well, I gotta get back.
Yeah, sure.
Well, how about that?
That's it.
What are you doing out here?
Just sitting out here?
I've got 23 women and they'll be here in a minute...
...and you just sitting out here.
Mother.
You are supposed to be helping Jessie this afternoon.
What are you doing out here?
Did you make the salad?
- Ruby-
- You didn't make the salad?
What are you doing?
What are you wearing?
I've got the Civic Club due here in a minute.
Mother, it's a big Indian festival day today.
- She told you about it.
- What big Indian festival?
I've got 23 women, they'll be here in a minute.
Did you make the pineapple and the marshmallow salad I told you to fix?
Not yet, dear.
But you can't walk out and leave me like this.
Well, that settles it.
They've got to go.
I have put up with their insolence, their arrogance...
...even their endless brood of relatives, but to ask me on a day like this-
You told her they could go.
I heard you.
I don't like this, young man.
I don't like it.
I promised I'd drive them out.
I won't discuss it. You are not going.
If you can't keep away from that girl,
I'll get her out of the house.
You go and do your work, just for once, or I'll have to talk to your father about it.
Oh.
- Hello.
- But-
- I'm Theresa Grayfox.
- I'm Sally Crowfoot.
- But she-
- Arita showed us what to do.
I hope we've got everything the way you like it.
But marshmallow.
You take my coat away. Oh.
Oh, Sarah.
- Looks like we're too early.
- No, it's fine.
It's just that everybody else is a little late.
You just walk right in.
Cim!
Hyah.
- Yancey?
- What?
It's almost 3 in the morning.
What?
Did you wake me up to tell me that?
I want to go out and get Cim.
He hasn't come home yet.
Oh, honey, leave the boy alone.
- But it's almost 3 in the morning.
- It's 3 in the morning, fine.
He's not a baby.
But I don't want him out there with those Indians all the time.
I'm worried to death what's happening to that boy.
He has got no drive, no ambition at all.
And that girl, that Ruby.
I really think they're getting serious.
Well, they are, well, that's just fine.
It shows he's got good taste.
Can't you see I'm worried?
Yancey.
We have got one son.
That's all we've got in this world...
...and I see him drifting away from us day by day.
And it's my fault, both of us.
Please, we've got to do something about that boy.
Please, before it's too late.
- Please.
- All right. All right.
You're really worried about him, aren't you?
You promised that you'd make up for all the things you never did for him.
Well, now is the time.
Please, Yancey.
We have got to find a way to get him out of this town...
...into a different kind of environment entirely.
I know we'll never be rich like everybody else, but if we find money enough to-
What's that?
Oh, no.
Oh, my.
This could be the answer to everything.
Do you know what it could mean for the boy to be the son of a governor?
It says they just want me to come up and talk about it.
- But-
- It doesn't say that I've got it yet.
So you mean there's a chance you might not get it?
Oh, you women.
If you didn't have anything to worry about, you'd worry about that.
Oh, but-
It's something new.
And I'm so nervous.
Why? What have you got to be nervous?
How about that? Look here.
Oh, I guess I don't know how to act among civilized people anymore.
Look at that.
Yancey, look.
- We are invited to a party tonight.
- Fine, that's fine.
Not a party, the party.
The Congressional New Year's Eve party.
Isn't that wonderful?
- Anything else, sir?
- Hmm?
No, uh, thank you very much, son.
Thank you, sir, and happy New Year.
- Happy New Year to you too.
- Same to you.
- Yancey, isn't that wonderful?
- Hmm? Yes, it is.
To Sabra, my Sabra.
- Happy New Year, darling.
- Happy New Year.
Who are the Lou Brothers?
Well, they're the, uh... Uh...
No, actually, no.
There's only one man, I think he's on the committee that recommends me.
I'm not sure, exactly.
What's he want to see you for right now?
Well, it beats me.
Oh, my goodness, what next here?
Do you think something's wrong?
I don't know if there's anything wrong.
I tell you what I can do.
I can take a run upstairs and find out what it's all about.
All right.
I suppose I do that while you put on your nice, pretty party dress for tonight.
How's that suit you, huh?
Oh, you suit me fine.
Hey, you know something, Sabra?
You know, I got to thinking...
...I don't know, all that you've had to put up with from me, all-
Being married to me all these years,
I don't know how you've- Ha-ha-ha.
I don't know how you've managed to do it.
You don't expect me to be noble and deny it?
No, now, I want to tell you something, though.
Tonight, being as it's New Year's Eve,
I'm gonna make a very special resolution.
You know what it is?
It's a resolution that I'm gonna try to make it up to you.
I'm gonna try.
Say, honey, I need a shave. Yeah.
- Would you promise me?
- Maybe I don't need a shave.
- Yancey, would you really promise me?
- Yeah.
I know what you're gonna say.
All right, I promise that tonight I'll, uh, try to behave like a perfect gentleman.
I'll try.
- You go ahead. You look fine.
- I wouldn't say that.
But you can't go with the cigar.
Give it to me.
- All right.
- Don't be too long.
I won't.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What? What?
- No, wait.
- Honey, that's nothing.
Darling, I can't see. Turn around.
- Honey, that's okay, all right?
- That's it.
All right, okay.
Oh, how can I be so happy?
Well, Mr. Cravat, I'm Lou Brothers.
Come on in, sir.
Happy New Year to you.
It sure is a great honor to meet you, sir.
- Oh, this is Mr. Walters.
- Hello.
- Glad to know you.
- Mr. Self.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- Mr. Greer.
- How are you?
- And Mr. Hodges.
- How do you do, sir?
You know, it's not often a man has a chance...
...to meet either a great newspaper man or a great American.
Here we have both, right in the same person.
Yes, sir, and a great war hero to boot.
It sure is getting deep in here.
Hi, Yancey boy. How was the trip?
Well, now,
I didn't expect to see you here.
Well, that's the funny thing about this city, always expect the unexpected.
Yeah. So I see.
Everything all right? Your room all right?
Oh, yes, it's fine. Just fine.
All right, sit down.
Why don't you make yourself at home?
All right.
Well, now, this looks like we're getting ready for an all-night poker session.
What are the stakes?
I just wanted you to meet some of my friends.
Some of the boys you'll be bumping into, once you're the governor.
Gentlemen, it's like the fellow says:
"What's good for oil is good for Oklahoma.
What's good for Oklahoma is good for the country.
What's good for the country, well, it's good for the whole wide world. "
The man can't say "Pass the sugar" without bringing tears to your eyes.
Is there anything special you'd like to do or see here in Washington, Mr. Cravat?
I'd be more than happy to have my office take care of the whole thing.
Let me fill up your drink, governor.
Oh, hold on there, Tom.
I'm not the governor yet, you know.
It's just a little matter of signing your name.
- Am I right, men?
- Yes, sir.
- If you say so, Tom.
- Right.
The thing is, Yancey...
...you're talking to the committee right now.
Whoever we recommend will automatically get it.
- Are those real diamonds you got on there?
- Yeah.
My, would you look at that.
Two of them, huh?
You know something, when I see the way you've sprouted up, Tom...
...you know, the way, all this-
My goodness, it's really something.
Yes, sir.
And I ain't forgotten my old friends, neither.
Just like I know they won't forget me.
What do you mean by that?
You sure squeeze a man into laying it on the line, don't you?
I wouldn't say that, I mean I just want to sort of try it out and see what happens.
Well...
Let me put it this way, Yancey.
Ain't nobody gonna ask a man to do anything out-and-out dishonest.
Why, of course not.
But at the same time, a little cooperation-
No cooperation, and no governor, is that it?
I guess that's about it.
I see.
That's good liquor you serve here.
Well, we'll see, Tom.
We'll see.
Happy New Year, gentlemen.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, Yancey.
Oh, my, I can't get over it.
I just can't get over it.
My husband is going to be the governor, and I'm dancing.
Oh, come, let's dance again, please.
I want to swing around and around and around and around.
Oh, Yancey. I'm dizzy.
I was so afraid you'd disappoint me.
I didn't even want to think about it, your getting made governor...
...because every time I used to count on something, I'd only get disappointed.
But this time, this time when I really didn't think of it...
Oh, Yancey,
I want you to know how grateful I am...
...for what you do for Cim and me.
- Yancey.
- Sabra.
Sabra, there's something
I've got to talk to you about.
I can't do it, Sabra. I can't, I'm sorry.
Now, I know I promised and I gave my word...
...and I'm going back on that word, but I just can't go through with it.
I wanted to be governor for you and for Cim more than anything in the whole world...
...but I can't.
So that's the end of it?
I'm sorry I have to disappoint you once more, my darling.
But I can't do it.
No.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne
All right, that's the end of it.
Sabra.
What do you want me to say?
How am I going to go back and tell everybody you didn't get it?
I keep on watching everybody getting richer and richer.
We don't even have the money to get our own son out of trouble.
You talk as though the only thing we've got to do is to give him a big bank account...
...and everything will be all right.
No, Sabra, no.
We can't live his life for him, Sabra...
...and we can't expect him to live our lives for us.
Yancey, I have forgiven you a lot.
More already than I should have.
But I'm telling you now, if you disappoint us in this...
...I'm through.
- I'm just through.
- Don't say that, Sabra, please.
If you can't for your own son, you are selfish.
Can't you ever do anything for anybody except yourself?
Don't say that. Don't say that,
Sabra, please don't.
Go on. Go on.
Go away from me.
Leave me alone, forever.
But eight stories.
I know what I'm doing.
- We need it.
- You what?
At least, we will need it.
Two hundred thousand dollars.
That's a lot of money, Sabra.
I mean, you want to expand, all right.
Build yourself a little building, but that's a lot of money.
Didn't I always pay you back? Before?
Before? Before. Before.
Before, I loaned you 5, $600.
But $200,000?
What can you put up for security?
A very good dinner, Sabra. I enjoyed it.
Sorry I have to rush off like this, but you know how it is, business before pleasure.
I've got a lot of these things at home.
- Listen to that old fool talk business.
- Now, hush, Sarah.
High muckety-muck talk, that's all it is.
Just talk.
- Second childhood.
- I'll second-childhood you...
- ... in about two minutes, you know it.
- You know who I miss?
I miss old Yancey, the ornery old son of a gun.
Remember the time he picked us up?
On our way to the starting line.
If we're gonna go, let's go, you old tomcat.
Well, we'll be seeing you.
In a couple of months, when we get back from Paris, France.
Have a good trip.
- Bye.
- You take care of yourself.
I will.
Hi, boy.
- Good evening.
- How are you, Ruby?
Mrs. Wyatt.
Hello, Ruby.
My dear.
- Hello, Mother.
That was a good meal, wasn't it?
Well...
Why didn't you call and let me know you weren't coming home for dinner?
That's the least you could have done, no? Let me know?
I thought you knew we had guests.
Dinner was arranged accordingly.
That is impolite.
Mother.
Well?
Ruby and I have gotten married.
I know we should have told you before.
But I knew what your attitude would be.
Well...
What am I supposed to do now?
Am I supposed to kiss you...
...and tell you how happy I am?
No.
No.
We're leaving tonight.
I've got a job.
It's in Oregon.
Mother.
We did wanna say goodbye.
You needn't have bothered.
You go, you go, there's nothing to talk about.
If you want to throw your life away, then you just go ahead and do it.
Like your father did before you.
If you want to go, then go.
Aha. What are you doing here so late?
- We've been looking all over for you.
- How are you, Sabra?
We just came from your home and every place.
I've been trying to dream up something special to say...
...about the anniversary issue tomorrow.
So far, all I've got is a big, fat blank.
Sabra, this is Jacob Krubechoff, the famous sculptor.
I'm very honored.
How do you do, Mr. Krubechoff?
He's the best there is.
Half a million is nothing to ask for his stuff.
He wouldn't even pick up a chisel for a quarter of a million.
My work, I'm afraid, doesn't impress them half as much as my price.
Oh, dear Mr. Krubechoff.
The thing is, Sabra-
You know I'm building a university?
With all the children I got, it's cheaper to build one than to send them all to college.
Well, anyhow, I hired Mr. Krubechoff here to put me up some kind of a statue...
...something that'll stand for the Oklahoma pioneer.
- That's wonderful.
- We got to talking.
We all decided, the whole committee...
...that nobody stood for the spirit of the pioneer like you did.
So that's how come we wanted
Mr. Krubechoff to talk to you and all...
...and we thought maybe you'd pose and everything for him.
- Am I right, Sol?
- Yeah, yeah, yes, you know.
Something nice, like you and the little boy in a covered wagon.
Something nice, very simple.
But you're out of your minds.
I haven't decided yet what should be the best to represent-
Whatever it is, the spirit...
...but I would appreciate, maybe you'd talk to me.
Talk.
I'm afraid they have given you the wrong idea.
I was just sitting here thinking, as a matter of fact, you know...
...nothing really has turned out the way I thought it would.
My son and- Look at this.
That's my son.
My son, he had to run away to get married, to do what he wanted to do.
They won't live in the same state with me.
He won't even write me a letter once in a while.
And my husband. This is my husband.
He had to run away too.
I haven't heard from him in about 10 years.
- The newspaper, nothing, noth-?
- The news-
What's the newspaper? The newspaper.
Oh, my dear.
I've made it bigger, louder, more profitable.
Yes, I have made it more profitable.
But it hasn't got the spirit it had when my husband was here.
But, Sabra, please,
I mean, this whole thing-
And that's what you want to symbolize, the spirit of the pioneer, with me?
Oh, Tom.
This is very sweet of you, Tom.
What Sabra means is-
I think he knows what I mean.
Don't you?
- Let's all go and have a cup of coffee.
- I have no time.
- I'm sorry, I have to-
- Have you got the editorial?
No, I haven't got the editorial, but-
I'm trying to squeeze out something at least.
- Please forgive me-
- Look, this will take five minutes.
The newspaper will not run away.
- You will have a cup of coffee.
- That's enough.
You might as well go ahead.
- They've waited this long.
- What's happening?
- Coffee will make us all think.
- Off you go.
- You are out of your mind, all of you.
- Come on.
What's come over you?
You know what I ought to run tomorrow, in place of the editorial?
I was just thinking about it before.
We just go down for a cup of coffee.
One little woman told me once-
You remember her, Sol, Jessie?
Her name was Mrs. Pegler and she told me-
It was on the day when her husband got killed in the land rush.
" It's not worth it," she told me.
"I'm a woman," she said.
"Where are my children?
I'm a woman," she said.
"Where is my man? "
"It's not worth it," she said.
And I'm beginning to think that she was...
Oh...
Oh, you.
And you.
Cim.
Congratulations, Mother.
Oh, Ruby, darling.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Oh, my boy.
I'm afraid two of your honored guests are just a little sleepy.
- You brought the children too?
- Yes.
- Where are they?
- Over there.
Come with me. Come on.
Oh, Arita.
Oh, Arita.
Well...
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Mother.
Oh, do you remember when I told you to stick with it?
Do you remember that day when I told you?
Oh, she wanted to give up, and I told her,
"You stick with it, little lady. "
- And she stuck.
- Oh, you.
And she's made something.
- You said-
- No, no.
Speech. Speech.
- Speech.
- Speech.
- Speech.
- Oh, Tom, you make a speech.
- You are a much better speaker than I am.
- Speech, speech.
Speech.
Well, I feel-
I'm afraid
I feel like a fraud standing here.
If it hadn't been for so many people like Mrs. Pegler...
...there wouldn't have been an Oklahoma Wigwam at all.
And Jessie, who got us started.
And Sol, who kept us going...
...through all the mean and ugly years, both spiritually and financially.
Oh, yes.
And, uh, most of all... You were looking for the spirit of the pioneer.
Well, his spirit is here tonight.
God only knows where his ornery self is.
And you all know who I mean.
It's easy enough to drudge along and cling on to something...
...what somebody else has created.
And that's all I've done.
Just to survive.
But the leaders, the true pioneers...
...they are rare and hard to come by.
Sometimes even harder to understand.
And almost never appreciated until it's too late.
But such a man was my husband.
No, I don't mean "was," I mean "is. "
Because every time
I hear a sudden noise...
...or see an unexpected shadow,
I hold my breath...
...waiting for my Yancey to burst in on me and pick me up...
...and pick up the conversation exactly where he left it 10 years ago.
Well, I hope he still can pick me up, the weight I've put on.
Oh, my God.
My darling Sabra.
I can just hear you now, accusing me of chasing excitement again...
...but I feel sure America is bound to get into this thing, sooner or later...
...and I had to get into it as soon as I could, and don't ask me why.
I guess somebody's got to.
For 11 years,
I've been trying to write this letter to you.
And when I think of all the things you've given me and how little I've given you...
...how does a man say to a woman he loves:
"I apologize for loving you "?
We've just gotta be patient with each other, that's all.
Yes.
I just love you so much.
- What if he's a girl baby?
- A girl?
Yancey would send her right back.
Oh, I'll bet he would.
He's part of the history, a man like that.
We'll be proud of him.
Round and around and around and around.
Listen, I need you far more than you need me.
You helped me. You helped me.
Yancey.

You got a dollar?
All alone, off the land, like Thoreau.
Yeah.
Edible Plants of the Forest.
Gus? Gus, where are you?
Okay. Here we go.
SAM: But you promised, Dad.
You promised.
PRUDENCE: Next summe and I'm going to travel to Mars and Venus. this seems like a good time to get rid of that old box
Laurentians, here we come.
Hey, Gus, look.
Here we are.
I’m going to catch us a fish
Dinner, here we come.
All by myself.
Come on.
Rats.
I can't do it.
I just can't do it and too tired to write any more.
Go on, you old bear.
In a tree.
I tried again with my flint and steel.
Come on.
Everything we need.
The only thing we don't need,
Gus, is... that bear. that I will be completely alone.
Hey, Gus, look at this e?
What have we got here
This could be
Oh, mint.
Gus, where are you? of You go
Hey, what do you got there, Gus?
Nobody can ever find us here,
Gus.
It was very hard work.
Hi, Gus.
What have you got there, Gus
Hm.
Yes, I really could.
(whistling: I’ve Been Working

Shh.
Boy, I’d like to know where his nest is.
Huh?
No.
Continue patrol.
Roger. Wilco.
Phew.
I swear to it by this holy hemlock branch.
Okay. Come on, let’s move in.
One, dry algae to make flour from it. so I can continue my experiments.
Wow!
Rats.
What are you doing up here?
But you’re alone. right down there in that gorge.
You one of them?
Oh, no, ma’ ’am.
Come on!
Where do you live, boy?
I’m going to get me a baby falcon or die trying.
Keep in touch
Thank you.
Peregrine falcons. if my memory serves me right, and it usually does.
Of course.
Sam.
Sam.
Training.
Uh-huh.
Sam... you'll need a leather glove.
SAM: And so I bought some gloves.
Hey, what should we call her?
How about Frightful?
Frightful it is.
Come on, Frightful
I’m going to teach her to catch our dinner for us
And so my training of Frightful began.
Come on, little one. Come on.
That’s it.
You eat only when you're on my hand.
Good girl, Frightful.
Yeah. you'll have that BB gun of yours zeroed in...
I scraped the hair from the hide. and had a place to tan the deer hide.
Now I'm really getting prepared for the colder weather. but she has not yet learned to come to the lure.
Good girl, Frightful.
Good girl. so I was still experimenting with natural food sources.
Algae soup, here we come.
Hey, Gus, you got a friend.
Hey, you guys, how about some algae soup?
Well, at least somebody likes it.
Okay, Frightful, you’re on your own. you'll turn wild on me again.
Come on.
I'm going to share this with you.
Testemondia.
And who's that ferocious-looki creature, huh?
Look, name is Bando.
Let's be friends, huh?
How about you?
And I record them.
Come on, let’s be friends, huh?
Okay. take me to your leader.
The only way.
I agree.
SAM: Well, what do you think of it,
Bando? I mean, really?
William Shakespeare, my boy.
Say, Sam... if I stayed the ni ght here around the fire?
Come on.
It’s over here.
Well, I'll be...
These here are my food niches.
Quite a pad you have here, Sam.
Les pays trangers
Bando.
Bando?
Bando!
Bando!
You going to a fire or something? but it doesn't quite accommodate my legs.
I just don't need anybody.
This is a good place to fly Frightful.
(harmonica and guitar playing melody) for some sugar.
Right now, all this seems pretty dull. for any sugar tomorrow. we’re going to make us some syrup.
Mm.
Yeah.
Here comes your first pancake.
Not too many of those kind among people nowadays.
Well, eat the rest of it.
Maybe you'll get used to it.
Here, you try.
(playing "Twinkle, Twinkle,

Again. but now I was doing them myself.
Yeah, he's quite a character.
Yes, we shall meet another day ♪♪
Say, I could make some kind of a fireplace thing.
It should stand up well to heat.
When are you going, Bando?
Oh, any day now.
Find me some new strumming music, Sam. doing it all myself.
Mail a letter for me? so is good news from a far country. with any human animal.
She'’’s a great lady. the whole change that’s going come over this place.
You've got a great thing going for you up here.
Thanks, Bando.
I hope you find some new songs.
There’s always songs.
Well, so long now.
Keep in touch.
Everybody's leaving us,
Frightful. being alone, doing it... myself.
Hello, Mr. Otter.
Dried algae for your dinner today?
How about that, huh?
Here you go, Mr. Otter.
We're going to make it.
Bando was right about building that fireplace.
Hey, Gus, stop eating up our old fireplace.
Anyway, I finally got something that looks like a fireplace. we’ll have us a nice, warm home.
You'll need a leather glove.
(harmonica and guitar playing melody)
You lost, boy?
Air.
Air.
The fireplace is using up all our oxygen, Gus.
Now we won't suffocate.
Honest, he did.
I won't be gone long.
Hi
Did you, uh, manage to observe those falcons at close range?
Then come on.
Wait till you see her in the sky.
Oh, she'’’s glorious.
Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye, Miss Turner. and I was glad to talk to someone.
(Henry Mancini's
"Baby Elephant Walk" playing)
Oh, sure.
I am. and how to live off it.
It's dying.
Frightful.
She was my pet.
Yes, to be as deadly as any gun. and with it... came the snow. look so different, so bare and desolate.
I really loved her, and I need her. and mountains and marshes, as easily as the deer.
So bare and desolate.
Gus?
Gus?
Gu... (chittering)
Gus.
I thought you’d run off or something.
Hey, Gus, want an algae ice cream cone?
Well, let's go up and thaw it out.
Hi, you guys. Having fun?
Ew!
It decays as soon as the ice is melted away from it. because my breath fogs up the mirror and the eyepiece.
Wonder what Pasteur would have done. millions of miles away.
Most of the animals are hiding out from us.
We’re snowed in.
We've gotta save our oxygen, Gus.
BANDO:
Sam? Sam?
Sam, where are you?
Sam?
Sam, where are you?
I’m snowed in. Here. Here
BANDO:
You keep digging up.
I'm digging down to you.
That’s right, you keep digging up.
I'll be right back.
Come on.
Come on there, Gus.
I was in that old tree for two days.
Oh, Bando.
Oh, that’s too bad. to keep it growi ng after it got cold.
Now, Sam, what did I tell you about trusting me?
By the way, Sam, you got quite a few people worried about you.
And I came because of my experiments.
And I learned about survival.
I learned about myself.
That's quite a lot.
What now, Sam?
I've learned all I can here.
It's just time to go home.

Sure thing, Sam.
So long, Mr. Otter.

BANDO: Let's go, Thoreau.

- Good night, John.
- Good night, milord. Good night, milady.
- Good night.
Excuse me, sir. Is that
Lord Glenarvan's yacht?
- It is.
- Well, we'd like to see him, please.
Oh, would you, now?
He'll be horribly hurt to know... you didn't arrive for the start of the party.
We didn't even know about it.
I bring news of one of his ships, disappeared at sea.
A message from Captain Grant of the Britannia.
Captain Grant?
Why, he's dead, isn't he?
And just how would he get a bottle where he's at?
- Go on. Get on with you.
- Captain Grant's our father, and he's not dead.
I'm Mary Grant, and this is my brother, Robert.
Oh, no offense intended, miss.
He was a good man, he was.
The best this line ever had.
It's just that it's, uh, hard to take serious. The note in the bottle, I mean.
Still, I-I suppose it could happen.
And that's why we just have to see his lordship before he sails.
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
I've had my orders.
Nobody aboard except invited guests.
But we've come all the way from Plymouth today. It has cost me my last franc.
And we haven't had a thing to eat.
So that's it.
Another trick, is it?
Get out of here with your wild tales, your hard-luck stories.
You almost had me taken in for a minute.
Go on. Stand clear of the gate there.
Come on, Robert.
- Lovely.
- Good night to you.
You two, come back here!
Come back, I said.
You children, come here at once.
- Did you hear me?
- Good evening.
- Come back, I said!
- Good evening.
- Come back at once!
Come out now, matey, wherever you are.
You wouldn't want me to lose my bloomin' job now, would you?
- How do we get past this one?
- Good night, sir.
Oh, very simple.
Just walk nonchalantly... up the plank backwards.
Yes, with all the confusion... he won't be able to tell you from the departing guests.
Go on now. Go on.
Good night, sir, madam.
Good night, sir.
Good night, sir, madam.
- Come on.
- You now.
Go on. Go on, go on!
Good night, sir.
Good night.
Little boy, would you be so kind as to get my wrap for me?
- I think I left it in the salon.
- You children, what are you doing there?
- Stop those children!
- Evening.
- Come back, you two!
- Good evening. Good evening, sir.
Come back. Stop, you two!
Come on. Stop!
Come back, you two.
Come back!
- May I give you some more turkey?
- Thank you.
- Not too much.
- The salmon is delicious.
I hear Lord Glenarvan is going to Venezuela again this year.
Yes. He so much enjoys the seasons.
How long does he plan to be away this time?
He seems very proud of this new, uh, steamer.
Good evening.
Uh-Uh, cloves from Madagascar.
It is not bad for English ham.
Oh, excuse me, madam.
There's someone under the table! Look!
There they are!
Head them off the other way.
Steward! Steward!
Up there on the deck!
- Oh, let me go!
- Why?
Come back, you two! Come back!
Oh, come here.
Come here now, then. I got you!
- I got you!
- Oh, let me go!
- You leave him alone!
- Oh!
Oh. It's you, your lordship.
- Isn't it?
- I dare say, but who are you?
- Oh, please, your lordship, we must speak to you.
- We've come all the way from Plymouth.
- I'm Mary Grant, and this is my brother. Our father's Captain Grant.
- On the Britannia.
- And he's alive. And you must send a ship to bring them back.
- With two of his men.
- As quick as you can.
- Now, just a minute.
Come along.
We'll talk it over.
Now, then, how do you know your father's still alive?
- He put a note in a bottle.
- And a French professor...
- Monsieur Paganel, he found it.
- Oh-Oh, that again.
- What do you mean?
- My dear children, ever since...
I posted the reward for news of your father's ship... people have been turning up with notes they claim to have found in bottles.
- How many is this, John?
- Uh, 22, Father.
If I had my way, every last one of the culprits would be hanged from the yardarms!
Exploiting human misery, that's what it is.
Nothing more vicious, more treacherous.
But it is from my father.
I can tell.
Monsieur Paganel, show them the note you found in the bottle.
Voilà. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
Wr-Wrong bottle.
Ah, this is the one.
First question always, where'd you find the bottle?
Well, y-you see, milord,
I-I went fishing with some students.
And I suppose you cut open a fish and found the bottle inside.
Oui, oui, milord, a 220-pound shark!
Osborne, throw this man off the ship before I turn him over to the police.
- No, your lordship.
- But it is the truth, what I tell you.
Ridiculous. Why should a shark want to swallow a bottle?
Oh, what was in his mind,
I-I-I don't know.
I-I tell you only what was in his stomach.
You make a career of this, do you, exploiting children?
I am Jacques Eliacin
Francois Paganel.
Professor of geography,
Université of Paris.
My credentials, milord. Oh!
Forged, I imagine, like the note in the bottle. All right, steward.
Come along.
- Oh, no, your lordship, you can't!
- Monsieur Paganel's our friend.
Just a minute, children.
I have something to say to you.
If we could be alone for a moment.
Take your hands off me, messieurs.
Never have I been thrown from anyplace in my life.
Let's not set a precedent.
My dear children, don't you think
I'd be the first to respond... if I thought there was the slightest chance of finding your father... or any of his crew alive?
I'd go to the ends of the earth, and that's no idle boast.
The Glenarvan motto:
''Persevero. ''
It's been the family creed for 800 years.
But it's not a hoax. I saw the note myself, and I know my father wrote it.
The way he makes his letters.
I can tell.
Just a little more clever than the rest, that's all.
When you consider the odds, it would be fantastic just finding the bottle.
But this business about it being swallowed by a shark--
Well, what would my father have to do?
Come back here himself and say...
''Yes, I wrote the note.
Now come and find me.''
Did I understand you to say you came all the way from Plymouth?
Tell Osborne to get cabins ready for 'em. We'll drop them off there on the way.
- Very well.
- But what about Monsieur Paganel?
- We can't go off here and leave him.
- Now, my dear, I'm only doing what's best for you.
Now, then, how'd he get past you in the first place?
Well, how did he get past you, if it comes to that?
Now, wait a minute.
Oh, here's his lordship's wine.
- And about time too.
- A bit late, aren't you, Charlie?
It'll be a pretty rough trip if his lordship doesn't get his wine.
Uh, follow me, please.
This way, miss. Cabin number five on the starboard side.
Of course, Richard's a lot older than you.
Maybe not actually in years, but--
Oh, he's been around more.
I don't know what you mean by that.
After all, there's probably nobody else in the world my age... who's made as many trips to the Mediterranean as I have.
Well, that's just it! I mean... have you ever been to, oh,
South America, for instance?
As a matter of fact, no.
- Pacific Ocean. Ever seen that?
- It's only an ocean.
Perhaps you should have waited and had breakfast with my father.
He's the one who'd have to give the order to change course for South America.
Oh, he would go.
Nothing could stop him... if it were for something you could really believe in... and not this note in a bottle.
Let me ask you something. If you were a castaway and you had a bottle... wouldn't you put a note in it and throw it into the sea?
Oh, I don't think so. After all, it's such a small chance, isn't it?
Well, what would you do, then?
Just sit there with the empty bottle until you died or something?
All right. I suppose I would try it.
But I wouldn't expect someone to find it inside a shark.
Well, if that's where they did find it... you wouldn't expect them to just forget about you, would you?
You never saw that Frenchman before in your life... did you, until he showed up with the bottle.
And yet, you believe every word he says.
And no matter what he says, you and your father refuse to believe him.
Suppose I told you that I'd found a bottle with a note in it.
- Would you believe me?
- Well, did you?
- Yes.
- And what did it say?
It said:
''Disregard first message.''
Oh, I suppose you think that's funny, don't you?
You've got your father, so to you this is just a big joke.
Now, wait a minute.
I'm not making a joke of it.
- I'm just trying to show you.
- Please, do you mind?
- I'll make you an offer.
- What kind of an offer?
I don't necessarily believe this story about the shark swallowing the bottle.
But I am getting a little fed up with these infernal trips to the Mediterranean.
Down, boy. Good old boy. I'll bring you a bone or something later.
That's a good boy.
Oh, uh, bonjour.
In case you've emptied your own pockets.
And just don't let any shark get this away from you.
Thank you.
I assure you, mademoiselle, your case shall be properly presented.
After all, Father, suppose it was you cast away.
Do you think I would give up if I had even the slightest clue?
I'd live up to all the legends of Glenarvan. Persevere, if I had to move heaven and earth.
- Why don't we try Corsica for a change?
- Father, will you listen to me?
- Haven't been there for years.
- Suppose you were a castaway and you had a bottle.
You wouldn't just sit there staring at it until you died or something, would you?
You'd at least try putting a note into it.
And suppose for some strange reason it did get swallowed by a shark.
- Most unlikely, I'd say.
- Very well, then.
If you won't listen, I shall be getting off at Plymouth with Mary and Robert.
- Oh, come, come, come, come.
- I feel very strongly about this,
Father.
My dear boy, if that's the way you feel about it, let's have a look at the blasted note.
- Where is it?
- In the bottle.
- Well, where's the bottle?
- The Frenchman has it.
- Confound it, where's the Frenchman?
- You had him thrown off the ship in Glasgow.
- That's a fine thing.
When I really want something, no one takes the slightest notice.
- If I happen to drop a casual remark--
- Casual remark?
''Throw him off the ship before I call the police!
We ought to hang him from the yardarm.''
Now we're in a deuce of a fix.
That Frenchman might be anywhere by now.
Where's Captain Mangles?
Tell Captain Mangles to-- Oh!
- Oui, milord?
- Good gracious, the Frenchman!
- I thought--
- Oh, but I give you my word,
I was put off the ship.
Fortunately, I do not let such things upset me.
The note, milord.
Well, this is useless. There's practically nothing of it left.
Ah, but with a little study, a little intelligence... it is possible to make out what is said.
You will see one thing w-without question.
Their location is given as 37 degrees...
11 minutes, southern latitude.
That's no good without the longitude.
Consider first, milord, on the 37th parallel... there are only a few places they could be.
That's what I've always said.
If Captain Grant's anywhere at all, he's in Australia.
It's only logical, monsieur, if you know anything about shipping and commerce.
Use the head, milord.
The note makes reference to being captured, no?
And you can make out the word
''Indian'' or ''Indians.''
So where on the 37th parallel would they be captured by Indians?
- Australia, of course!
- Aboriginals, yes. Indians, no.
By George! I've got it. South America.
Couldn't be anywhere else.
And if he was captured by Indians, he'd be on the West Coast.
It's a matter of simple logic, monsieur.
We'll go there and follow the 37th parallel over the Andes... until we find Captain Grant.
Osborne, find Captain Mangles!
Tell him I'm going to change course.
- Thank you, milord! Thank you!
- Oh!
- Now, just a minute.
Don't forget that it was me who arranged--
- Thank you!
- Thank you, milord!
- Thank you, milord!
Oh, please!
I'm an Englishman, you know.
There, milord, is where we must go.
The pass of Antuco.
Then follow the parallel until we find Captain Grant.
Ha, jolly good trick to throw a bottle into the ocean from up there, I must say.
Ah, but could he not put the bottle into a river?
And would it not flow down to the sea, eh?
No, no. Grimpons.
- Grimpons.
- That means ''let's climb.''
It is the French recipe for the good life.
Whatever you want to do, don't be afraid to do it for fear of failure.
Don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain
- Let's climb, let's climb let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
- Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
Don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb
And if we fall, crash, bang
And die a terrible death
Never mind, we've had the joy the joy of the climb
Oh, don't be afraid of the beautiful and high mountain
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb, let's climb
Let's climb, let's climb
Oh, look! Look!
Straight down that valley there.
- Where?
- Do you see it, milord?
A river into which one might throw a bottle.
- By Jove, yes!
- And an Indian village.
I'd say, this could be just the place, couldn't it? Have a look, my dear.
Better make camp here tonight and get an early start in the morning.
Hey, you, make camp.
Stay here tonight.
- No stay.
- Huh?
- What's the fellow talking about?
- Ah, it is not Spanish.
It must be a local Indian term.
Hey, hey, hey.
What means trango peeray?
Oh, I-I-I-I-I think he-he wants to tell us... it gets, uh, terribly cold up here.
Oh, we build a fire, no matter how cold.
No matter how trango peeray, we stay in hut.
- No stay.
- Listen to me.
I tell you when to go and when to stay.
- No stay.
- We stay here tonight!
- You stay. We go.
- Don't you dare to try and tell me!
I think the fellow really means it.
Well, that's done it.
Without the horses, we're helpless.
- We'll never make it.
- Well, can't we still go on on foot?
But of course, mademoiselle.
The Araucanians have... crossed these mountains on foot for hundreds of years.
- Even drive their sheep.
- Oh, good!
- When do we start?
- We're not gonna start.
I'm not gonna go leaping about like a-- like a confounded mountain sheep, thank you.
- Oh, please, your lordship, please!
- No, no, mademoiselle. Uh, he's right.
Uh-Uh-Uh, we-we'll, uh, return to the ship with the Indians... and get some crewmen who are younger.
- Age has got nothing whatever to do with it.
- I'll take over and lead the-the expedition.
You-You-You can remain in your deck chair.
You lead the way? Ridiculous! Have the whole lot of you lost in no time.
On the other hand, with me in command... it would take a great deal more than, ha, trango peeray to turn us back.
- That's right, isn't it?
- Right, your lordship.
Monsieur Paganel, do you think we might have one tonight?
When you are in the poultry yard, it is a good time to wish you catch the egg.
See? Look at this. See?
Any slight tremor of the earth, and it starts to swing.
But if you're asleep, how could you tell?
Oh, maybe all night I sleep, uh, with one eye open.
Perhaps his lordship will sleep better... if we do not tell him before tomorrow... what trango peeray means, eh?
Your pleasure, mademoiselle.
Castaway, castaway
Trust in your star
You know I will find you
Wherever you are
Though all your dreams
May be tossed by the tide
Cling to your hopes
Never cast them aside
Castaway, castaway
Though you may be
Lost in the wilderness
Over the sea
I will discover
Your castaway shore
Then you'll
Be a castaway
No more
You'll be
A castaway
No more
It's my father's favorite.
E-Ever since I was a little girl,
I've always thought it sad.
Not the way you sang it.
Oh, it's just the way I feel tonight, I suppose.
Oh, it's all so exciting.
We're up here.
Father's down there.
The stars pointing the way.
It's almost like being in heaven.
- I know.
- Ah, there you are, my boy.
Better get some sleep, you know.
Got an early start.
- We're too excited to sleep.
- Mm, so I see.
You'd better come along with me, just the same.
Wait. I want to make a wish on that star.
What could you wish for that you haven't got?
That my father would go somewhere and get lost.
Just for a little while, you understand.
- What on earth are you doing?
- This is to wake me up.
- Wake you up?
- Yes, in case--
- In case what?
- Oh, nothing.
- And what is this, may I ask?
- My watch, milord.
Perhaps I want to look at it during the night.
How very peculiar.
Oh, Robert, really.
Do put those things away.
But if there's an earthquake,
I want to be sure and see it.
Earthquake? Who said anything about an earthquake?
Oh, I'm so stupid, milord.
I didn't realize it until later.
The Indian, when he did, uh-uh-uh, that, you see?
He did not mean it was cold. No.
He meant trango peeray-- earthquake!
- This is the land of many earthquakes.
- Good gracious me.
In the whole world, no place has such big... such beautiful, such magnificent earthquakes as right here.
But it is one chance in a million we should be so fortunate.
Yes. Yes. Yes, of course.
Quite right.
Besides, this place looks as if it's been here for hundreds of years.
Doesn't it?
I mean, uh, it's safe to assume... that it will last one more night, eh?
- Oui, monsieur?
- Oui, milord.
And I'll wake you up if one comes, your lordship.
- It worked!
- Oh, Robert, do be quiet.
An earthquake of the first magnitude.
I say, do you have to shake the whole place?
By Jove, it's an earthquake!
Outside, everybody!
Oh! Oh, magnificent!
This is an experience that makes our entire expedition worthwhile.
By Jove, that was a narrow squeak! Oh!
I say, this is getting rather dangerous.
Then we attempt to change course.
Everybody to port.
- It worked!
- That's better. Much obliged.
- Look out! Look out!
- This way, everybody, quick!
To the port, quick!
- What the-- Port, quickly!
- No, starboard!
- Port, I say!
- Starboard!
Where are we going now?
- Perfect timing.
- Oh!
- Abandon ship!
- No! Wait!
- There's a hole in the ice!
- But we don't know where it goes.
We'll soon find out.
Alpine-type glacier.
Drift minimum.
We'll never get out of here alive.
The ice melts and gets out.
Why can't we?
- Isn't it beautiful!
- Oh!
They'll never believe us when we get home. If we get home.
Look out, everybody! Duck!
Where--
Where're we going now? Ooh.
Try starboard, I tell you!
- This is most peculiar.
- Look out!
- That was close.
- Oh!
Mary!
Come on!
- Where's Robert?
- Here's his hat.
Robert! Robert, can you hear me?
Not down there.
I'm up here.
Oh, a giant condor.
A Sarcohamphus gryphus.
Robert, hold on!
I don't have to.
She won't let go.
This is true. She will not let go until she reaches her nest.
- Reaches her nest?
- Yes, high in the mountains.
No doubt she has little ones that must--
Hang on, Robert.
We're coming!
- Robert!
- I got dizzy coming down... but it was a jolly good view from up there.
- Oh, thank goodness you're all right.
- I wonder who fired the shot.
Perhaps he did.
A Patagonian. Magnificent!
It's like turning back the history book hundreds of years.
Hope he's not dangerous.
Permit me. I-I've learned a few primitive words.
Anyway, even if you don't understand...
I-I want to thank you for saving my brother's life.
- Happy could do.
- Heavens, he speaks English.
First-class shooting, sir.
First time, right through the heart.
No. Shoot through heart... bird go limp, drop small boy.
But shoot back of head... bird go stiff, wings go up.
He circle down, land boy safe.
Y-You mean, you-you purposely... i-induced motor paralysis through damage on the medulla?
- Not understand.
- Neither do I.
- Can you tell us where our father is?
- He was captured by Indians.
- On the 37th parallel.
They were kidnapped, washed up on the shore, captured.
Three white men.
Indians hold them for ransom money.
- You very slow to come.
- Are they all right?
Last time I hear, they are well, but very tired of being prisoners.
Just a minute. What do you mean,
''last time you hear''? Don't you come from the village where they're held?
No. I'm an Araucanian chief,
Thalcave.
My people do not rob, do not steal, do not hold prisoners for ransom.
- Well, where are they?
- Far away, at the foot of the mountain.
Great plain reaches far as you can see.
- Many days to cross.
- The pampas.
Well, couldn't you take us there?
First we stop at my village for horses and supplies... then Thalcave will try help you find them.
Much rain there.
You sleep in tree. May come flood.
Flood? By George, that's a good one.
A giant ombu tree,
Phytolacca dioica.
- Magnificent specimen.
- Oh, please, may we sleep in it?
You can sleep where you like, but I certainly don't intend to roost... in a tree like a confounded sparrow.
Pitch my tent just here.
You in tree, listen!
Flood come. Much water.
You stay in tree. I bring help.
- My father?
- I wake him.
To be safe, we tie things so they do not fall.
Flood come. You go quick to tree.
I ride for help.
Not even raining.
Just like on a ship.
Make ready for the storm.
Look! The flood!
- Father! Father!
- John, be careful!
- Father, hurry up!
- Now what's going on?
- Come with me!
Can't a fellow get a decent night's rest in this place?
- Come on, Father!
- Oh!
Come on.
They've got it!
Hold on!
Highly irregular, flood like this-- and not even raining.
With some food in your stomach, milord, the world will feel a lot brighter.
- Oh! Look out below!
- Oh!
Sorry, milord.
Why cry about bad weather
Enjoy it
Each moment is a treasure enjoy it
We're travelers on life's highway
Enjoy the trip
Each lovely twist and byway
Each bump and dip
If there's a complication enjoy it
You've got imagination employ it
Then you'll see roses in the snow
Joie de vivre will make them grow
Voilà, that's life
Enjoy it
Since I must do the cooking
I'll enjoy it
This ombu tree smells gorgeous
You'll enjoy it
A hurricane comes your way enjoy the breeze
You're stranded in the jungle enjoy the trees
If there's a complication enjoy it
You've got imagination employ it
This tree's a cornucopia
Why, it could be--
- Utopia
- Voilà, that's right, enjoy it
Why cry about bad weather
- Enjoy it
- No, enjoy
Oh, each moment is a treasure
Enjoy it
- That's better. Enjoy it.
- We're travelers on life's highway
Enjoy the trip
Each lovely twist and byway each bump and dip
- Good.
- If there's a complication
- Enjoy it
- Enjoy it
You've got imagination employ it
Employ it
From eggs and herbs au naturel
Omelette ombu a la Paganel
Pour vous, milord
Enjoy it
Voilà!
Robert, can you see anything... that looks like an Indian on horseback coming to our rescue?
- Only some birds.
- Only some--
Only gone down half an inch in two days.
We'll be here for 10 years at this rate.
Cheer up, milord.
We pay no rent.
Mother Nature sets the table for us.
And, fortunately, we have plenty of water.
That's very fortunate,
I must say.
- Very fortunate.
- My father will never trust another Indian.
But Thalcave's different.
He said, ''I bring help.''
- And he will.
- If he got through.
Don't even think such things.
All right.
But if I may paraphrase... what a wise young girl once said to me many years ago:
''If you were marooned in an ombu tree... and you had some logs and something to tie them into a raft... you wouldn't just sit there until you died or something, would you?''
That's very good.
For a girl, I mean.
I suppose most girls are taught embroidery and things.
But Mother died after Robert was born.
And Father, being a sea captain--
When we first met,
I had a different impression.
Most girls can be rather silly.
Do you know what I mean?
- No, I don't.
- Well, you're different.
- How different?
- I don't know how to say it.
I had it all worked out last night.
Sounds rather silly now, though.
- What does?
- Well, you don't expect things of a girl, certain things... like climbing mountains, going through floods, making the most of it.
You know what I mean?
Don't think I do.
Well, I want to say that...
I think you've been just fine, for a girl.
Oh, what I really mean is that if we get out of here alive... and when we're old enough--
- John!
- Mary!
There's the log you've needed for your raft.
That's it, just what we need.
Perfect!
Got it.
- Oh!
- Keep out of the way!
- It's a tiger!
- No, no, it's a jaguar. Felis onca.
Get that beast out of here!
It's probably as frightened of us as we are of it.
- Just a big cat, milord.
- Well, get rid of it. Get rid of it.
Can't stand cats at the best of times.
Confounded things always make me sneeze.
Go on! Get out of here!
- Go on! Get out!
- Don't, John! The poor thing.
Do not move, not an eyelash.
''Marooned in ombu tree.
Latitude, 37 degrees south.
Longitude, 66 degrees west.
Send help immediately.''
One, two... three, four, five... six, seven.
More than two kilometers away.
My father always told me, never go near a tree in a thunderstorm.
One, two, three... four, five.
I think it's getting closer.
Yes. At 35 degrees centigrade... sound travels at approximately-- one--
Great heavens, the tree's on fire. Look!
We'll beat it out.
No time for that sort of thing.
Get out of the way!
You see? It's too late now.
The oil in the ombu tree, milord, it has a remarkably low flashpoint.
- Onto the raft. It's our only chance.
- Look out!
Oh, no!
- I'll get it.
- No, don't!
Apparently, we have our choice: eaten raw down there... or roasted alive up here.
Hold on, everybody. Mother Nature comes to our rescue. A waterspout!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
We're still several degrees off course, you know.
Hurry up with the canvas.
There's a breeze coming up.
Aye, aye, Captain!
You're strangely quiet, aren't you?
- Sorry, milord. I was thinking.
- I don't know which is worse, by George: having you so happy you sing all the time, or so glum you won't even talk.
''The ombu tree is gorgeous.
Enjoy it.'' Huh.
I am stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!
I know, but that hasn't worried you till now.
- It is better they do not hear.
- Better they don't hear?
What are you talking about?
It is something
I remembered in the night.
- How could I be so stupid?
I don't know, but the shark I caught...
- Land ho! with the bottle, it was a mako shark.
- It--
- Ahoy!
And as well as I know anything in the world, I should know that the mako shark lives only in--
Be quiet! Ahoy there!
Ahoy. Ahoy there!
I think I see it. There.
- A canoe!
- Ahoy there! Aho--
Good heavens. It's an Indian war canoe.
This is a fine fix.
We're completely unarmed.
- It's Thalcave! He did come back!
- What? Thalca--
Ho-ho. Thalcave, my good man.
Delighted to see you.
- I bring news.
- News? What kind of news?
You come in canoe.
We go fast to village... where they hold prisoners, three sailor men.
Three sailor me--
Oh, monsieur, we've found them!
It's like a miracle.
Thank you, my lordship! Thank you!
Oh, I say, I say. Careful. Come along.
Let's get aboard. Careful, now. Careful.
You're a welcome sight, sir, believe me. Is this thing safe?
Forty-six, 47, 48...
Oh, now it's come,
I can hardly believe it.
- We're saved!
- We're saved!
Stop it! Stop it! Who the devil are these people? Where's Captain Grant?
These not right men?
It's all my fault.
How could I be so stupid?
It's what I started to tell you, milord, about the mako shark.
- What about the blasted thing?
- It lives only in and around the Indian Ocean.
That's what the-the word ''Indian'' means in the note... not that they were captured by Indians.
If you knew this, why didn't you tell me before I paid out all that money?
I kept hoping, milord, that maybe somehow I could be wrong.
This can mean only one thing:
Captain Grant is in Australia.
Australia? That's where
I wanted to go in the first place... only I was stupid enough to let you talk me out of it.
Oh, my dear children, I'm so sorry it all had to end like this.
Listen! Thalcave speak.
For many years, my people hunt... trail game many miles.
Sometimes sneak up, but game not there.
But Indian knows if game not there... it somewhere else.
Keep looking: otherwise,
Indian die out many years ago.
''Keep looking.''
He's right, you know.
Now we know where Captain Grant really is.
And by Jove, we'll go and find him.
Oh, thank you, Thalcave.
Thank you.
- How does she look to you?
- Just what we need.
- Ain't a ship hereabouts could overhaul her.
- What about the steam?
- We can learn.
- The old man wants to know what happened to the Britannia.
- Maybe I should tell him.
- You're not serious, now, are ya?
Maybe I should tell him.
The very spot, your lordship, where she sank beneath the waves.
Now, it's me own dear brother who lost his life... tryin' to put out in a small boat to save some of the crew.
- It was shockin'.
- All right, Osborne. Pay 'em off.
- Very good, milord.
- Thank you, lordship.
Much-- Much obliged.
- I don't wanna see any more.
- Very good, milord.
Look at that!
Ridiculous! Preposterous!
How can the same ship go down in a dozen different places, sometimes
500 miles apart? Answer me that.
Ah, confounded wharf rats! Lie to you, take your money, cut your throat if you give 'em half a chance.
How the dickens can I tell where to start, eh? What do you want?
- Mr. Frederick Ayrton to see you, milord.
- I told you I didn't want to see anybody else.
- This is a gentleman, your lordship.
- I do hope I haven't arrived at an awkward moment.
I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner.
I would've warned you not to offer a reward.
- Well, as a matter of--
- I'm afraid you'll find very little integrity... among some of the men who frequent our waterfront.
And it so happens that
I have the very information you require.
- About my father?
- Ah, so this is the daughter of Captain Grant.
Well, if I can reunite this delightful child and her gallant father... that is the reward I'm interested in.
Were you ever in Plymouth?
Plymouth, England?
No, I haven't had that pleasure.
May I inquire, sir, as to the nature of your information?
Oh, well, two years ago,
I was caught in a violent storm in the Tasman Sea.
We picked up a poor fellow, badly battered and halfdrowned...
- just off the coast of New Zealand.
- New Zealand?
He said he was from the Britannia and that she'd gone down with all hands.
He died during the night, and our ship combed the area the following day.
You know, until I read that piece in the paper about the message... in the bottle, I had no idea that there were any survivors.
But why wasn't the sinking reported when you reached your destination?
Well, I assumed that it was. I was only a passenger on the ship, you know.
Heavens. If he landed in New Zealand, he must've been captured by the Maoris.
I'll report this to the authorities at once. Osborne!
- I'm afraid it isn't as easy as that.
- Why ever not?
You haven't had my experience in dealing with our colonial government.
Eventually, you learn to get along in spite of them.
They talk endlessly, and they need authorization from London.
You'll be lucky if they're ready in a year.
But anything could happen to him in a year. What do you suggest?
Oh, I-I can't afford to get mixed up in this.
I've told you all that I know, and-- and I've got my own estates to run.
Sir, the lives of three men are at stake.
I'd like to speak to this gentleman alone, please.
The trouble is,
New Zealand is not in the Indian Ocean.
There is something strange, very strange.
I don't care what it is.
I've seen that man before.
- Oh, you're just imagining it.
- No, I'm not.
Anyway, I can't stand people who look at me like that.
''Delightful child.''
''Gallant father.''
Perhaps it's a good sign that neither of you take to him... because it seems that everything else that you've welcomed with open arms... has turned out dead wrong.
Please understand I don't wish to do anything against the law.
-Oh, certainly not.
-But at the same time, I don't intend... to leave Captain Grant in the hands of those bloodthirsty cannibals.
So, uh, I appeal to you as a man with experience... and knowledge of local conditions to help us before it's too late.
All right. I'll gather up some men who know the Maoris... and who can handle any kind of situation.
By Jove, you mean we just, uh, go in and have it out with them?
Oh, good heavens, no. We'll take along some supplies to barter... and then if Captain Grant and his men are still alive, we'll buy them back.
Capital idea. I can't tell you how grateful I am to you.
- I need hardly remind you that we must be discreet about what we plan to do.
- Ooh, of course, of course.
- Don't want to be tied down by a lot of confounded red tape, do we?
- No.
Just my son John and Captain Mangles.
Otherwise, not a word to a soul.
Yes, just as it should be.
Get this crate down in the hull, would ya, lads?
Motley looking lot of fellows you've got together.
Well, when you look for men to go into Maori country... you don't choose them from among the socially elite.
Jolly well put.
But I must say, I didn't realize you'd require quite so much merchandise.
Ooh, I'm afraid the days are gone when one could impress the natives with a handful of colored beads.
And if they choose to sell their prisoners dearly... we'd better be prepared.
I see.
John, you've got to tell me.
What's going on out there?
Ah, mademoiselle, you are far too beautiful... in the new gown to worry your pretty little head about such things.
But what's in all those boxes?
I would've thought if my father wanted you to know, he would've told you.
Every man out there looks like a fugitive from the penal colony.
John, you've got to do something. Don't let this man make a fool of your father.
Just because he called you ''a delightful child'' and you don't like it... you think he's trying to make a fool of my father.
It is better that we think it, monsieur, than to give him the opportunity to prove it.
All right. Let me tell you something, both of you.
Maybe my father huffs and puffs a little bit, and we've all smiled at him just in fun.
But I don't think anybody's going to make a fool of him quite as easily as-- well, certain people I could name.
And now, if you'll excuse me.
Patience, dear.
We shall see what we shall see.
I'll wager she's faster than any ship in the Royal Navy.
Good. You know,
I'd say that... steam was the coming thing if it weren't all so complicated to handle.
Well, you don't have to complicate it.
Actually, it's quite simple.
- Yes?
- Pardon, milord. Uh-Uh, Could I talk... to you sometime before too long?
- Certainly. What about?
- No matter how much I think about it, it is always the same.
Captain Grant is in Australia.
There is no possible way the note could mean he's in New Zealand.
Oh, my dear fellow, don't worry about that beastly note.
Mr. Ayrton knows precisely where the Britannia went down, don't you?
- Of course.
- Milord, I'd be the happiest man... in the world if it turns out that once again, I'm wrong.
- I've no doubt you will be.
- If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to see the engine room.
Oh, my dear fellow, delighted.
Take you around myself.
I think you'll find there's nothing complicated about steam.
It's a beautiful day. Why not enjoy it, let bygones be bygones?
Now that we're at sea, I can let you in on our secret, if you're interested.
Those boxes you were wondering about.
Would you like to know what's in them?
Trinkets. Trade goods.
They're for barter with the Maoris so that we can buy your father's freedom.
- Who told you this?
- Mr. Ayrton.
- And you believed him?
- All right, Miss Suspicious.
If it'll make you more companionable,
I'll take you below and show you.
Well, here you are.
All right, Pandora.
Which box do you want me to open?
- That one.
- You sure you don't have a guilty feeling?
After all, it is rather like spying on someone... especially when they've gone out of their way to be so nice to you.
- Open it.
- I will.
Nothing is too much trouble if it satisfies your curiosity.
Voilà, mademoiselle.
''Trade goods. Trinkets,'' he said.
So that's his game. He's using my father's ship as a gunrunner.
Pity you did that.
Wilcox, down here!
We've got to warn the others. I'll lead them off, then you make for the door.
- There he is!
- I see him!
- Ooh! Oh!
- Now, is that a nice way to behave... when we're taking you to meet your father?
Come on.
Make no noise. Just stop the paddles.
Anything else, and I'll shoot.
Ever been to New Zealand before?
Yes. Twice.
Do as I tell you, and perhaps you'll live to make it three times.
- We're stopping.
- That is most strange.
- Raise the hands quietly.
- Do as he says, Robert.
Help! Pirates!
Lord Glenarvan, help!
Come quickly!
Lord Glenarvan, help! Pirates!
Lord Glenarvan!
I thought
I heard the boy call for help.
You did. Now, give me that gun, and no harm will come to him.
Wait.
I say, you can't put us out there without oars. It's not human.
Oh, the current will carry you to the shore, if that's any consolation... but I'm afraid we'll have to keep your crew on board... until they've taught us the fine points of using steam.
We're unaccustomed to such luxuries in the South Pacific.
- You'll pay for this.
- You've got it backwards, old man.
We have been paid for it, and quite handsomely. Cheer up, Frenchie.
You promised you would be the happiest man in the world... if you were wrong about Captain Grant being in Australia.
And you were. Brown and Riley, lay aloft and stand by to make sail.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- You were in Plymouth!
My father signed you on the day he sailed.
As third mate. What a memory.
You'll hang for this, you know.
I'll see to it personally.
I'll make a full report to the admiralty.
You do that.
And here's a bottle to put it in.
Let's hope it isn't swallowed by a shark. Lower away!
You'll never get away with this.
That's what Captain Grant said when we put him over the side... at this very spot with his two rather foolishly loyal mates.
If you're lucky, you might all end up in the same stewpot.
If anyone is interested,
I might explain.
It is the influence of the west wind drift... playing against the east Australian current... that might drive us right up onto the shore.
Yes, yes, yes.
That's the second of my ships he's got.
First the Britannia, and now my beautiful new steam yacht.
It's all clear now.
It was a mutiny.
There's no reason why he should lie about it.
My father was set adrift here--
Then he must be a prisoner of the Maoris.
What did he mean, we might all end up in the same stewpot?
Not to change the subject, but our reception committee seems to be waiting.
Maoris, hundreds of'em.
Deuce of a fix.
No trinkets to bargain with.
What have we got to offer, huh?
Just us, I suppose.
- Good gracious!
- You come as a stranger, and I take ye in.
I have prepared a place for thee in the presence of thine enemy.
- It's all right, my dear.
I'm sure he's harmless.
- What think ye now?
I be crazy, eh?
Not a bit of it.
I be smart. Mark ye well the words of old Bill Gaye.
Bill Gaye! Weren't you the mate on my father's ship?
Depends entirely who your father was.
What was his ship?
And who you be, for that matter?
You see, I be smart.
Makes a difference who she is.
I'm Mary Grant. My father's
Captain Grant of the Britannia.
Well, why didn't you say so before?
Fine ship, she was.
I walked her decks across the seven seas.
Woe be onto thee, O Moab, for thy sons are taken captive.
- Who is he?
- Fantastic, he seems to be the mate from the Britannia.
Do you know where he is?
Can you tell me?
Where is Captain Grant?
Have you no eyes?
Can you not see?
- He's gone.
- Where?
Same as before. Diane's Inlet.
- Did the Maoris take him?
- He be smart too.
He learns the way to keep alive, for they need him when they get more guns.
Guns? Then it must be Ayrton.
Aye, that's who it be.
Somehow the devil has got another ship.
- Were there three of you?
- Aye, three of us there were.
Captain Grant, McNabb and old Bill Gaye... against Ayrton and all of his mutinous crew.
- The scoundrel!
- Bonjour, monsieur.
My father, Captain Grant-- Did he and
McNabb go together to Diane's Inlet?
Nay, my child.
I say unto you:
McNabb, he was not smart.
He was caught when he tried to escape.
Odd devil.
- What's he laughing at?
- For this child, I have prayed.
And the Lord hath granted my petition, which I asked of him.
This is the night the Lord hath given us our salvation.
What think ye? Could a man force himself through there... even a man who has gone without food to make himself as thin as a man can be?
Nay. I say unto you, it is impossible.
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.
Robert, do you think you could crawl through there?
Maybe if I tried very hard.
- You be smart too.
- Even if he could, what good would it do?
I'll show ye now. The Lord helps them that helps themselves.
Two years we took to make it, from the hairs of our heads... from the garments we wore, from a thousand things we gathered.
Absolutely preposterous. What could the boy possibly do all by himself?
There be more to it than that, for this be the night of the haka.
Bide ye your time till the night be well begun... and the horns sound and the flames leap upward... and the devil hath seized the souls of our captors.
Then I will show the way.
- Nobody's looking. Now's your chance.
- Right. Up you go. Up.
- It looks awfully small.
- Go on. Go on!
I'm stuck.
Let out all the air.
Upon my soul, I don't know which is worse: a crazy man... who thinks he's smart or a Frenchman who admits he's stupid.
- Hold that.
- Oh! Ooh-ooh!
Now to get the pendulum swinging.
Oh, do be careful!
Lower away.
I have the unhappy feeling we're going out of the frying pan into the fire.
He can't get over!
The rope's not long enough!
Lower away!
- He still can't do it.
- Go on! Lower away!
That's all there is!
Then let her go!
He did it!
Tie that down there.
Go down it.
Go. Bye.
- Deuce of a fix this is.
- Off ye go to the mountain.
We'll never outrun these fellas.
By Jove, I never saw a rope burn like that.
Gunpowder. It's woven in like a fuse.
Aye, what say ye?
Who be smart now?
''Vengeance is mine.
I will repay,'' said the Lord.
Father, come on!
If this is the sacred volcano of the taboo, they dare not follow.
You know of such things, even though you be a stranger?
Aye. I be smart too.
Aye. We be two of a kind.
- By Jove, they've stopped.
- What think ye now of old Bill Gaye?
Be he crazy or be he smart?
They dare not set foot here, for all this is taboo.
I say, that's splendid, isn't it?
- But they're moving on again!
- A slight miscalculation, milord.
- I'm afraid we're on the wrong volcano.
- Just as I thought.
- Out of the frying pan, into the fire.
- Don't worry, milord.
Some help, please!
- What are you planning to do?
- Uncork the bottle and let the genie free.
Oh, I've got it!
Everybody, push!
- Lucky shot, that. Chance in a million.
- At the university, milord...
I'm considered the wizard of the croquet court.
Come ye, where we'll be safe.
- Oh, it's horrible!
- Have no fear, mademoiselle.
The Maoris can run faster than the lava. Enjoy it!
And now, Mr. Gaye, to Captain Grant.
Aye, to Captain Grant!
Follow Bill Gaye!
He's got it all planned out!
All right, Grant.
Tell them there are six more boxes... nearly 200 rifles still in the hold.
I'll set the whole lot ashore as soon as they hand over the money.
And how do I know the rest are as good as this one?
- I give you my word.
- That's what you offered last time... when you unloaded a pile of junk.
Now, really, Grant.
Every time I do something charitable,
I live to regret it.
Like putting you ashore alive.
And I intend to stay alive by not recommending rifles I haven't examined.
My beautiful, beautiful yacht.
If they've done anything to damage her...
I'll have them strung up by their thumbs.
How did you know where she was going to be?
This be where they always unload: in Diane's Inlet.
In Diane's Inlet? Oh!
In the note, what I thought said
''Indian'' was really--
Oh!
I'm stupid, stupid, stupid!
Cheer up, my friend. Your stupidity may turn out to be of divine inspiration.
Mr. Gaye, I thought we were going to find Father.
We be. We be. Look ye now.
It's Father!
He looks well, thank goodness.
- They're all getting into boats.
- They're comin' here.
We have but little time to prepare our reception.
- I come to see thy ship.
- No one can come aboard.
Surely ye be not afraid of old Bill Gaye?
- Bill Gaye?
- ''The hoary head is a crown of glory.''
Know ye not that?
- How many do you want, Lucky?
- That'll do.
How many cards do you want?
- So where's mine?
- I gave you them.
What a hand here. Right.
How do we get past him?
Excuse me, sir, but is this Lord Glenarvan's yacht?
Well, sonny, I guess--
Here. Wait a minute. Ain't you the boy that's with that lot? Come back here!
- Your lordship.
- We haven't got the keys, Captain.
We'll have to break the door down best we can.
- Put out your decks, gentlemen.
- I'm busted.
- See if Thompson'll play.
He's got money.
- Yeah. All right.
- Your deal, Bob.
- Right. Here you are.
Riley, come here quick!
- The brig!
- The brig!
Know ye not what the Good Book says? ''He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it''?
Send him over to me.
Ooh, got him! Quick.
I suppose we'll have to open every box.
Put the best ones on top.
Ayrton, you scoundrel!
Don't move. You may live long enough to hang.
Hello, Glenarvan.
Welcome aboard.
Well, here we are.
This makes us even, doesn't it, uh?
You've got your ship back, and I'm bringing you Captain Grant... so, uh, why don't we, uh--
Captain, take him below with the rest of the scoundrels.
Aye, ye've sown the wind... and I say to you, you shall reap the whirlwind.
Back, you dogs! Back, I say!
Bill Gaye! What on earth--
- Father!
- Mary. Robert!
You think I be crazy, don't ye?
See now, how are the mighty fallen.
- How on earth did you find me out here?
- Monsieur Paganel.
- He's a French professor.
- He found a note in a bottle.
- Lord Glenarvan took us on his yacht.
- And we've been all around the world looking for you.
- South America.
- And we were captured by Maoris.
- Maoris!
My dear children.
Oh, how I've prayed for this day.
- I was beginning to give up hope that I'd ever see you again.
- I must be catching a cold.
And now you're suddenly here, and I'm able to hold you both close in my arms.
I can't find words to express my gratitude to all of you.
We would've been here months earlier if
I hadn't been so stupid about the note.
- The note?
- Yes. The-The note in-in the bottle.
The note in the bottle?
What think ye now? It was I put that note in the bottle.
And put the bottle in the sea.
''Cast thy bread on the waters... for thou shall find it after many days.''
But they seemed so sure it was their father's handwriting.
- It was, wasn't it?
- Now you know my secret... why I ran away to sea.
The voice is the voice of a God-fearing man... but the hands are the hands of a forger.
- Oh, my word!
- Bill, you scoundrel!
Just think. If he hadn't put the note in the bottle... and if Monsieur Paganel hadn't caught that shark--
And if you hadn't tried to slap my face that morning on the way to Plymouth...
I wouldn't have talked my father into making this trip.
- Funny how things work out, isn't it?
- Isn't it?
Here we are, all of us together.
All of us.
Did you ever see so many stars?
Once, on top of a mountain.
Did you know that down there, out of the light, you can see the Southern Cross?
Southern Cross?
So, that's my little girl.
By George, they do grow up.
Uh-Uh, I was just thinking to myself.
No matter where you are in the world... it is always different, but it is always the same.
In English, you would say...
''All climates are the same for love.''
There it is.
The Southern Cross.
He dies for a rifle.
¿Murió bien, eh?
¿Pero para qué?
¿Para esto?
¡Para nada! ¡Para nada!
Whoa.
Let's go, men.
¡Alto!
¡Chica! Vàmonos!
Good morning, amigo.
Maybe you can help me.
No hablo inglés.
Esto es Mexico.
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Español.
Can I help you?
- What was he saying?
- That you're in Mexico now.
That anyone coming to Mexico ought to be speaking Spanish.
You, uh, in command here?
No, but I speak English.
Seen this man?
Hey, Joe.
- Mornin', darlin'.
- Where you going, Joe?
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm on my way.
You say all day, all night.
All night, all day?
Did I say that?
- You say.
- Ah.
Well, uh, things is different now.
The soldiers.
Yeah.
I gotta go.
Why don't you try this hotel.
He may be in there.
You mean they let Indians in there?
Anyone who can pay, sir.
One moment, please.
What is your name?
I am Lieutenant Franz Von Klemme from the Imperial German Army.
I'm what you'd call an adviser.
I'm Lyedecker.
Policeman.
You got some money?
Money?
What the hell for?
Get out of the window!
For me, yes?
Some dollars for me?
I saw you got dollars.
- I thought you said you loved me.
- Sure.
You give me money?
Yeah, well, later, maybe, huh?
I yell pretty loud.
Then the sergeant come up.
You want to talk to them?
What do you want to do with them?
Well...
Well, what do you mean?
They were pulling out the railroad track.
Your track.
Oh, my company's.
Not mine.
Why do they do that?
Damn it!
Why?
Why have they been fighting us for 400 years?
Because they're Yaqui Indians, that's why.
They call them los tigres de la rocas... the tigers of the rocks.
They say your track is on their land.
What shall we do about it?
Oh, whatever's customary.
Whatever you think is right.
Of course.
Muy bien.
Verdugo...
Verdugo...
I'm no part of this.
Do what you like... a trial.
I'm no part of this.
Look.
I know the value of things.
Bullets are valuable.
These are not.
No.
Listen.
Don't be like that.
You can give me money... or I'll make you some trouble.
Come here.
- Sargento Paletes!
- Señor.
Run! Run!
Run, Indians!
Run, Indians! Run!
Run!
Hey!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
¡Cabrón!
Mi general.
He is our prisoner.
Too bad I had to interrupt your entertainment up there.
Yes, you distracted my soldiers...
disbanded the Indians...
Very clever.
But now I got you.
Yeah.
Well, you wouldn't have me if that hotel had a back door.
Very clever.
Very clever.
Now, General, you don't wanna do that.
He's a very valuable man.
If you got to kill him, why don't you let me have him?
Perhaps I will kill you too.
That won't get you very much either.
- He's your friend?
- He's no friend of mine.
Well, then, what is he to you?
Bank robber.
He stole $6,000 from the Citizen's Bank in Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr. Lyedecker... how much did you say he stole?
Six thousand dollars.
- Uh-huh. When?
- Twelve days ago.
Twelve days, huh?
I see.
Fifty dollars.
Where is the rest?
You look Mexican, but you don't talk Mexican.
- What the hell are you?
- Well, I sure as hell ain't no damn Mexican.
My mama was a Yaqui Indian... and my daddy was from Alabama.
I see.
Well, I hope you know how to die.
I admire a man who dies well.
Now, tell me... where is the money? Hmm?
The money.
All those dollars you speak of.
Where are they?
Women and whiskey.
That's what I'd do if I was him.
Oh?
Six thousand dollars in 12 days?
Oh!
You could be the biggest stallion in the world...
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
Now...
No.
No, it was not spent on women or on whiskey.
Now, for the last time, where is the money?
Just like he said, jefe.
Half of it I spent on whiskey and women... and the other half I wasted.
Excuse me, sir, but if he spent the entire night in the hotel... don't you...
Yes.
Yes, let's go and take a look.
Where is the money?
Hey, friend, I hear your mama sells it on the street.
I don't think he understands English.
All that's fine.
But where's the money?
You really the honest-to-God law?
Somethin' wrong with that?
No! No.
You caught me, didn't ya?
That's right.
Now I gotta see about gettin' you out of here.
See, you bein' the Yankee law don't cut no ice with the Mexican army.
They ain't gonna let you get out of here.
Well, why don't you buy us out?
The money ain't worth gettin' killed for, now, is it?
I ain't got no money.
- Bank says different.
- Oh, I took it, all right.
But I spent it two days later.
- What did you spend it on?
- Rifles.
Rifles?
One hundred rifles for the Yaqui Indians.
Them poor devils hangin' on them telephone poles out there... them's Yaqui Indians... my people.
Well, if you tellin' the truth... that general's gonna kill you real slow.
Well, let me tell you about that general.
They told him to get rid of the Yaquis any way he could... and he took the easy way.
He's just killin' everybody.
Well, you've spent enough time in the States. You as American as me.
And you know you just can't go around stickin' up banks.
Yeah.
But I ain't goin' back.
Yes, you are.
On foot, on horseback, or hangin' across a saddle, you're goin' back.
How is it over there?
It's crowded over here.
How about out there?
Well, I think, with a little bit of luck, we might be able to get out of this.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna jump right out that window behind you.
Go ahead.
¡Sargento Paletes!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
Yaqui!
Mi caballo.
¡Sargento! ¡Vamos!
Well, I think we lost 'em.
All of'em.
Well, do you bring the rifles?
You damn betcha.
Romero send you?
Where are the rifles, Joe?
How come he sent a woman?
- They're expecting a man.
- Oh.
Now, uh, where are the rifles, Joe?
On the Chilina trail, not too far from here.
Well, I hope so.
They're there.
And where is the profit for you, Joe?
There ain't none, Sarita.
Look, you told me to get the rifles, and I got 'em.
- What are you bein'so tough on me for?
- Because I know you.
Boy, you sure have soured up in the last few years, ain't ya?
Yes. I have changed.
I watched them hang my father... and I helped him to die.
You hear that?
I helped my father to die.
You say the Chilina trail?
Yeah.
We'll see.
Mara.
Oh, shoot.
Now, why'd you do that?
I wasn't gonna do nothin'
I couldn't have done before.
You're pretty good, Joe.
I can't take any chances with you.
- Let's go.
- Where we goin'?
Back to Phoenix.
How come them to give you a badge in the first place?
Well, I guess I took a job that nobody else wanted.
Even at that, it took me a whole year to get it.
- How much they gon' give you for takin' me back?
- Two hundred dollars.
And the job permanent-like.
Shoot, that ain't even hardly worth botherin' about.
Well, Joe, that depends on what you got in the first place.
Yeah.
I ain't never been worth a damn in my whole damn life.
Ain't never been worth nothin' to talk about.
I never even had a job permanent-like.
But now I finally done somethin' for somebody... me.
I finally amounted to somethin'.
Yeah.
You robbed a bank.
Let's go.
I should have known.
You lied to me.
There's no sign of tracks.
No people. No guns.
What are you talkin' about?
They're there. Come on. I'll show you.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
- Where do you find him?
- I didn't find him! He found me!
Will he help us?
- Señor, will you help?
- Hell, no.
- Why not? You ain't got nothin' better to do.
- It ain't my party.
Come on.
So, we meet again, huh?
You murderer!
You assassin!
Too bad I don't have enough time for you right now.
Lopez!
Now you...
Mr. Sheriff.
Mr. Half-breed.
By the time
I'm through with you... you'll be ready to tell me everything I want to know.
I'm not afraid.
Damn it!
Stay on your feet!
Go to hell!
Damn you, you big son of a...
Muy bien.
Ay. Look what the rurales found.
Rifles.
Two Indians with these mules.
Now, how would two Indians... find 100 rifles, huh?
They were skinned alive.
Slowly.
But they wouldn't say.
Tsk tsk.
Nice day, Verdugo.
Indeed it is, Mr. Grimes.
Hello.
My name's Grimes.
Steven Grimes.
Oh, that's... that's nice.
Mighty nice.
Well...
You know, fellow Americans.
And, uh, what's a nice fellow like you doing in a place like this?
I'm with Southern Pacific.
We run the railroads here.
Then, uh, you're really all right with that general, ain't you?
Look, Lyedecker, what's the point of all this?
If you don't tell him what he wants to know, he'll have you killed.
Well, maybe put a good word in for us.
- Why don't you get the hell outta here?
- Tell him something.
Anything.
Six thousand dollars is not worth dying for.
And he's just gonna let us go.
Is that right?
Why don't you go away and stop botherin' us?
Look.
If he has you shot, it'll create terrible problems.
- It'll be a terrible thing for all of us.
- Sure as hell will.
- For us or for the railroad?
- For both.
The way relations are between the United
States and Mexico...Well, you know.
Look... we don't wanna talk to you.
You understand?
We don't wanna talk to you.
Hey, wait a minute, Joe.
Wait a minute.
He's got the rifles, and he's got us too.
What do we got to lose?
Tell you what you do.
You go tell that general I wanna see him.
What about my men?
How are they progressing?
Well, sir, they fight well, they train well.
They don't seem to take too naturally to the drill.
Well, the parades will come later.
As long as they can fight.
Sit down.
Sit down.
What disturbs you?
The rifles, sir.
Someone is arming the Yaquis.
If they get hold of any more guns, you're going to have the tiger by its tail.
The Yaquis do not have the rifles.
I do.
Yes, sir, at the moment you do.
Von Klemme, you worry me.
That was my intent, sir.
No. I mean, you worry me.
- Oh?
- Yes.
You...You seem afraid.
Of what?
I don't know.
Perhaps if you would return to Mexico City...
I would prefer nothing more than that, sir, if my orders could be changed.
You know that I don't need you.
But, you see, sir... we Germans are here to advise, so we advise.
Oh, yes.
Now, tell me, what perfect piece of advice have you this time?
Finish off the Yaquis as quickly as possible before more guns come through.
I know that, don't I?
Of course you do. Then send them south and sell them to the wood merchants.
No. It isn't worth it.
The prices are too low.
I have to feed them, send some of my men with them.
By the time we sell one, the price will be lower than the price of a cow.
Then kill them all.
That is your advice?
That is my advice, sir.
Very good.
So, all the time, eh?
All the time the $6,000 was right there in my front yard, huh?
Incredible.
- I'll take him back now, General.
That's the deal. Right?
- Now wait.
Wait.
Tell me something.
Where are the other rifles?
I don't know what you're talking about.
When do they arrive?
Answer the question, Indian.
- You got 'em all.
- That is not the answer!
- There ain't no more guns!
- How do you know that?
You know, Lyedecker, as I told you before,
I think you're part of it.
I ain't a part of anything!
This man stole $6,000. For that amount of money, there can't be no more guns.
You refuse to answer, eh?
Look, there ain't no more damn guns.
Very well.
Too bad, gentlemen.
¡Sargento Paletes!
What did all that mean?
Look like they're gonna shoot us.
Verdugo, I suggested that if they told you about the money... you'd let them go.
Grimes, you run the railroad.
I'll run the state of Sonora.
And don't you ever forget it.
- Por favor, General...
- ¡No, señor!
¡Alto!
You know somethin'?
What?
I think our string has done run out.
The hell it has.
We're gonna get out of this.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Well, there's nothin' to it.
A big, giant hand is gonna reach in here, pick us up... take us away and put us down someplace... right in the middle of a whole bunch of women and whiskey.
That ain't funny.
Well, I ain't laughin' neither.
That ain't funny at all!
Stay out of other people's business.
That's what I always said and that's what I always done.
But look at me now.
Smart Lyedecker.
Hung up on a fence with a bunch of scruffy Indians.
Well, that's too bad about you.
Your number's comin' up over there, and it's just too damn bad.
- You know why?
- No, I don't know why. Why?
- 'Cause you'd have been a hell of a lawman.
- You damn right!
'Cause you don't care about nothin' or nobody... just like all them big boys with their badges.
What do you know about badges?
You're just a pissant border half-breed.
I know a lot about it.
I know all about them small-town, barbershop, hair-cuttin' sheriffs.
And I know all about them big-town, big-bellied... billy club-swingin' policemen from St. Louis.
- You don't know nothin'!
- The hell I don't!
They look you up and down, and you're guilty!
You don't get no trial, just like we ain't gonna get one now!
'Cause them guys over there don't care about nothin' or nobody, just like you!
That's why you'd have been so good with a badge.
Washington's going to react very badly to this.
What are they going to do?
Send a note saying,
"Where is our black policeman?"
- And then what?
- They'll ask questions.
They're going to ask my company a great many questions.
And they will get answers,
I'm sure.
Your company cares for its trains... not for two gringos that disappear in Mexico.
¡Fuego!
Hold it, gentlemen.
Padre.
My sons, allow me to help you...
We ain't no damn sons of yours.
There's probably more than one scattered around here someplace.
Fear and despair are human failings.
Yet we are human.
Make yourselves ready to die in peace and love.
Why don't you talk to Verdugo about some of that peace and love... instead of tryin' to get somebody ready to die.
That's right.
Ain't no man ever died ready for it.
I want you to go with love in your hearts.
I want you to go to hell.
Allow me to hear your confession.
Whatever you got in that book, just put me down for it.
- Lyedecker.
- What?
I'm sorry you got mixed up in this.
You ain't half as sorry as me.
¡Ataque!
What the hell?
Goddamn it!
Come on! Come on!
¡Rapido!
¡Vamos! ¡Vamos!
Hyah! Hyah!
I want their heads.
Some kind of woman, ain't she?
Yeah. Kinda stout.
Now that you got them rifles...
what are you gonna do with 'em?
- Take 'em to General Romero.
- General.
Why every time four Mexicans get together, one of'em makes himself a general?
Look, you.
Romero can call himself anything he wants.
I knew him when he was young... when he brought the people together to fight.
Good or bad, he's all we have.
It's a good thing you have him,
'cause me and that one there, we goin' north.
We are, huh?
Yeah.
What do you say we wait till we get them rifles to General Romero?
Then I'll go easy-like.
Uh-uh. No good.
Lyedecker, you're a mule-headed son of a bitch.
You saw all them Indians hung up like a side of beef.
- After all the trouble we went through to get them rifles...
- We?
Yeah, we!
Look, I spent 15 years in the 9th Cavalry... keepin' the law and chasin' bad Indians.
But this one ain't my business, it ain't my fight and it ain't my job!
And besides...
I don't much like Indians anyway.
We should have killed him!
Yeah.
I think she's right.
You know your trouble, big man?
You're dumb.
Just plain ol'black-ass dumb!
Now who's dumb, you half-breed?
Huh?
I am!
Let me up!
Come on!
Thank you.
Don't shoot him!
And let him kill you?
The rifles, they are more important.
I don't wanna drag his big ass all over Mexico.
- What's it gon' be?
- I guess I ain't got much of a choice, have I?
We split up here.
You take the guns upriver.
I'll meet you in Delgado.
I'm glad to meet you.
Ah.
Woman, what are they looking at?
It's the first time they've seen a black man before.
Well, if they wait a while, they'll see this one turn into a chili bean.
I sure wish I had myself a fried steak.
Well, two or three times now, you could've killed me.
Sí.
That is true.
- I need you.
- What for?
Mira.
Those rifles, they are what keeps Joe here.
He is what keeps you here.
I want you to help us.
No, I won't do that.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. Yeah, I reckon I am.
Oh, not of being shot at.
That's happened plenty before.
Lyedecker, if... if you would join with us... for just a little while...
I won't worry about YaquiJoe.
Afterwards, you can have him.
You ain't, uh, partial to him?
No.
I don't trust him.
He's a bad man.
But he's smart... and he's important for us now.
Nothing else?
No.
Nothing.
No deals. I'm gonna take him back, and there ain't gonna be no deals.
We got problems. Verdugo's about one mile behind us, but I don't think he saw us.
Get the rifles. Let's get out of here.
¡Vámonos!
Adios.
Gracias, kid.
Keep goin'!
Go on!
- ¡ Sargento!
- Mi general.
Collect all the children and take them to the rancho.
With the general's permission, the time might be better spent collecting the rifles.
Von Klemme, I'm gonna tell you something once and for all...
and let it be a lesson for your future.
I never do anything without a purpose, and remember that.
Humara.
Los niños. Los niños.
El rancho.
El rancho.
Yaqui.
The children.
They've taken all of the children... and holding them for the rifles.
They're holding 'em for us too, you can bet.
Well, we have to go back.
Look, Sarita, I think we ought to go on to Romero... give 'em the guns, and get some more men, huh?
No. We have to get those children.
We will.
We'd better make this quick and quiet.
Shh!
Well, I wonder if he died ready for it.
Get them kids out of here!
Hey, big fella.
How you doin', man?
Where's Joe?
Where's the whiskey?
I guess you never can tell where they might go to drink, huh?
Don't-Don't shoot, Lyedecker!
For God's sake, don't shoot!
- I didn't know it was you.
- Obviously!
Hey, Joe, look what I found.
Hey, Big Ben.
You ain't still thinking about taking me to Phoenix with you, are ya?
You'd better believe it, hombre.
Well, you're a stubborn, son of a...
Damn.
Well, what's you gonna do with him?
Well, uh, whatever's customary and whatever you think is right.
I'll-I'll be glad to take care of him for you.
Lyedecker, this is silly.
There's no need for...
Keep him alive.
We might be able to use him later.
I'll do it.
Didn't turn out to be much, did it?
Hmm?
Pretty fancy, huh?
For me?
Too fancy for me?
She had one like it when my father worked here a long time ago.
She's dead now...
Verdugo's wife.
I always wanted one like it.
It looks like you were born for it.
It's a lie. But you're a pretty good man after all, Lyedecker.
I guess I know that.
I know what I am.
I don't have to go looking for it.
Then why are you a policeman?
It's a job.
Everybody has to do something.
What the job is ain't important.
It's how you do it.
Are you good at what you do?
Well, it ain't much different than the cavalry. I do the best I can.
Well, that is a hard thing to do.
For all the bad things
I have said to you...
I give you this.
No. No! No!
No! No!
Please, not like this!
Not with you.
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
Lyedecker.
He died yesterday.
Ah, sí. The black gringo.
We have heard of you.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Good day for travelin', and we're gonna travel.
Hey.
What is this stuff?
What is this "mi general"?
- You mean you don't know?
- No, I don't know.
Well, it seems that you have been elected the new general.
I ain't no damn general.
That's just...
That's the dumbest...
That's just plumb crazy! Come on!
Buenos días, general.
Look, you tell them to get out of here.
Tell them I don't want 'em following me.
Tell 'em to go away.
Tell 'em I ain't no general.
Not for no bad-ass Indians.
Not for nobody.
You tell 'em.
It looks to me like... you're back in the cavalry business...
mi general.
I'm sure the rifles are somewhere up there.
I can promise you that, with Romero.
No.
If he gets the guns and the ammunition... he will probably come down that mountain, and we'll have war.
I know Romero.
He's a dying tiger.
He wouldn't come downhill with an army of 10,000 cannons.
No.
Lyedecker is the one.
I want his head on a stick in the middle of the plaza for everyone to see.
Lyedecker and the others.
Sir, I personally think we ought to be going after Romero.
Now, listen to me, Von Klemme.
I know Romero.
I know these mountains.
I know my country, and you don't!
So shut up.
Shut up and follow my orders.
I want Lyedecker.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
Buenos noches, mi general.
Lyedecker?
Oh. Your supper is almost ready.
- Tortillas?
- No.
Look what I found.
You said fried steak.
Is that, um, the way it is?
If that's the way you want it.
No.
Let me get that.
Here?
Lyedecker, you are my man.
You know, you gotta be, uh, careful about a thing like that.
I don't have to be careful.
I am your woman for as long as you want it.
Do you want me?
What does Verdugo use that train for?
- What are you going to do?
- Answer the question.
Now, look, you can't be...
You're not going to wreck the train?
In one minute, I'm gonna pinch off your head... and mail it back to the home office.
The train carries troops and supplies from Nogales to Hermosillo.
It's well-guarded.
Does it make any stops along the way?
No.
- No stops.
- There is a water tower...
in the plano, the flat part.
He stops there.
Now, look, you're not going to wreck the train.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Lyedecker...
God!
Dear God!
He ain't gonna help you.
¡ Hey, muchachos!
¡Una muchacha!
No, no, no, no.
He ain't here.
Well, must be he didn't make the trip then...
'cause I've been watchin' this car all the time.
- How many did we lose?
- I don't know for sure.
Hey. You did a real fine job.
You seen Grimes?
No.
Last time I saw him, we were diggin' in.
I saw him.
He had a horse.
I guarantee you, he's almost to Nogales by now.
What the hell are we gonna do now?
Load the train up.
We're still goin' in.
- Uh, hello. Buenos días.
- Buenos días.
¿ Verdugo aquí?
Well, is he here?
Grimes, I should have you shot.
What are you trying to do, become an adventurer?
Well, that's good, because the role does not suit you.
Tell me, Mr. Grimes... how did you happen to be with them in the first place?
I was taken at the point of a gun.
I was a prisoner.
- For so long?
- All right.
He did return... finally.
- You escaped, huh?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
They're going to attack the town.
Really?
- How?
- They've taken the train.
Are you sure?
You saw it?
I heard the plans.
- There was nothing I could do.
- Of course not.
Look.
Let them come in.
And after they've gotten off the train... we can catch them in the streets.
Mr. Grimes, that would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.
First, you have them nicely trapped on the train... and then you allow them to get into the streets and houses?
Grimes... your train will be a small sacrifice to our cause.
- Go check up there... the machine gun.
- Yes, sir.
¡Alto!
¡ Fuego!
Sarita!
We did all right, didn't we?
Yeah, I guess we did.
I mean, we won, didn't we?
Well.
We won, huh?
Yep.
I think I can put the train back into running order. I thought you'd like to know that.
It'll take time, and I'll need men for the labor.
Yeah.
It's important that, uh... we know where we stand, huh?
What the hell for?
Well, look out there.
You're their leader now.
You should think about that.
- I ain't no dadgum such thing.
- They think you are.
They do?
This place is yours, and you have an army.
With them, you can control the entire area for good or bad.
You're ready to say no to that?
Damn right I am.
Oh, no, you're not.
A man like you... with your intelligence?
The whole state can be yours.
All of Sonora.
- No. Hell, no.
- You have to.
The choice isn't yours.
The decision's been taken out of your hands.
Do you know what'll happen if you walk away from all this? There'll be anarchy.
- What...
- These people...
Your people, they'll drift apart without a leader.
And then another general will come from Mexico City... with another army, and these streets'll run with blood again.
You'll need to move men and supplies.
You'll need the railroad.
I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
Lyedecker!
- Hey, you ain't leavin' are you?
- Yep.
You can't do that.
I mean, I ain't goin' with ya.
What are you gonna tell 'em?
What are you gonna say?
Well, I'll tell 'em I just didn't bring you back, Joe.
Of course, they'll be able to see that for themselves anyway, won't they?
Yeah, but you're the leader.
I mean, if you go, there could be anarchy.
There could be blood in the streets.
Look, Joe, they'll follow you now.
In fact, it could be a good deal for you.
Yeah, but, Lyedecker, what do you got to go back to?
You came down here with nothin', not even a job permanent.
- After all them years, nothin'.
- Yeah, I thought about that.
You did?
What'd you think?
I thought I oughta go back and give it one more shot.
Lyedecker, maybe
I oughta go back with ya.
You don't wanna do that, Joe.
You belong here, and I belong up north.
Like I said,
I wanna give it that one more shot.
And, Joe, good luck, amigo.
All right, dadgumit, let's get this dadgum army together!
All right!
All right!
Greece and the islands
of the Aegean Sea...
...have given birth to many myths
and legends of war and adventure.
And these once-proud stones,
these ruined and shattered temples...
...bear witness to the civilization
that flourished and then died here.
And of the demigods and heroes
who inspired those legends...
...on this sea and these islands.
But though the stage is the same,
ours is a legend of our own times...
...and its heroes are not demigods,
but ordinary people.
In 1943, so the story goes...
...2000 British soldiers lay
marooned on the island of Kheros...
...exhausted and helpless.
They had exactly one week to live.
In Berlin, the Axis had determined...
...on a show of strength
in the Aegean Sea...
...to bully neutral Turkey into
coming into the war on their side.
The scene of that demonstration
was to be Kheros...
...itself of no military value,
but only miles off the coast of Turkey.
The cream of the German war machine,
rested and ready...
...was to spearhead the attack.
The men on Kheros were doomed...
...unless they could be evacuated
before the blitz.
But the only passage
to and from Kheros...
...was guarded and blocked
by two great...
...newly designed,
radar-controlled guns...
...on the nearby island of Navarone.
Guns too powerful and accurate...
...for any Allied ship then
in the Aegean to challenge.
Allied Intelligence learned
of the projected blitz...
...only one week before
the appointed date.
What took place in the next six days
became the legend of Navarone.
Yes?
I'm looking for
Commodore Jensen.
I'm Jensen.
Come in, Mallory.
You're late.
I'm sorry. Our plane was attacked an hour out of Crete.
- We got into Alex on one engine, sir.
- The Germans have a price on you...
...and Andrea Stavros of 10,000 pounds apiece.
How did you know that?
I should do. I'm your boss.
You've been working for me the past 18 months.
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance.
Did they say you were going on leave?
Yes, sir. They did.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's not true.
Not yet, at any rate.
Here's your old chum.
Come and say hello to him.
You haven't changed since Athens.
Hello, Roy.
Come along, gentlemen, will you?
Barnsby...
...these gentlemen have an interest in Navarone.
We've heard you on radio, but perhaps you'll be more specific now.
I'll be specific.
As you can plainly see, it was bloody awful!
Squadron Leader
Barnsby's Australian.
But we'd love to go back, wouldn't we boys?
- Sure! Right!
- Just as soon as we can! But...
...only on one condition.
We want the joker who thought of this to come with us...
...and when we get there...
...we're gonna shove him out at 10,000 feet...
...without a parachute.
Bloody right.
- It was bad as that?
- Bad?!
It can't be done.
Not from the air, anyway.
You're sure about that, squadron leader? This is important.
So's my life!
To me, anyway. And the lives of these jokers here...
...and the 18 men we lost tonight!
Look, sir...
...first...
...you've got that old fortress on top of that bloody cliff.
Then you've got the bloody cliff overhang.
You can't even see the bloody cave, let alone the guns.
And anyway, we haven't got a bloody bomb big enough...
...to smash that bloody rock.
And that's the bloody truth, sir.
I know how to hit those guns.
Yes?
Yes, sir.
You fill a plane full of TNT...
...and then you do a suicide dive right into that cave.
There's just one problem, sir:
Getting someone to pilot the plane.
I see. Perhaps you might consider it yourself.
Thank you, squadron leader, and all of you.
I know you've done your best, and nobody could have done more.
And I'm sorry.
As you've probably surmised, I'm the joker they'd heave out at 10,000 feet.
And I can't say I blame them.
I knew it was hopeless from the start, but it had to be tried.
Anyway, this is why you were hauled out of Crete.
And don't mislay this, will you?
No, sir.
We're pressed for time.
Let's go, gentlemen, shall we?
- Any questions?
- Only one.
Why me?
What you want is a seagoing taxi driver.
Other men know these waters as well as I do.
Yes, but you've got special qualifications.
Franklin'll explain it.
It's his idea, anyway.
First, you speak Greek and German.
Second, you've kept alive in occupied territory for a year and a half.
And before the war, you were the greatest mountain climber in the world.
"Keith Mallory, the human fly."
Come to the point, Roy.
The point is that our Resistance contacts on Navarone...
...say there's only one spot on the coast the Germans don't watch:
The South Cliff.
It's 400 feet straight up...
...and it can't be climbed by man or beast.
And that's where you come in.
That was your idea too?
That's right.
I want you to get me and my team over there and on top of that cliff.
When you've done that, you can take a richly deserved leave...
...and a long-overdue promotion.
I see.
Can you do it?
No.
With all due respect,
I think the operation is insane.
But that's not my business.
My business is to climb and I haven't climbed in five years.
That's a long time.
It's too long for this cliff.
And you're asking me to do it at night.
I wouldn't try it in broad daylight.
I'll have a go myself, then.
I've climbed a bit.
Don't be a fool. You'd get yourself killed and your team along with you.
- Then it's scrubbed?
- No, it's not scrubbed!
It can't be.
Not now.
Mallory...
...this is our last hope.
The Germans won't expect a team of saboteurs at this late date.
Those 2000 men on Kheros will die next Wednesday morning...
...unless somebody climbs the cliff.
There's nobody else we can get in time.
If there were, you wouldn't be here now.
I suppose it's too late to get
Andrea Stavros to help me.
On the contrary.
I think you'll find him waiting for you in your hotel.
You think of everything.
I have to. It's part of my job.
- Thanks, Keith.
- It's my pleasure.
Nothing I like better than a well-organized setup.
You'll want to know about the team.
Sydney, would you get us some more coffee, please?
Franklin considers it the best team in the business. I agree.
He himself is ideal for the job. He's experienced and extremely capable.
Don't blush, Roy.
And best of all, he's lucky.
Aren't you lucky?
- If you say so, sir.
- I do, indeed.
Napoleon said once, when somebody was up for promotion to general:
"Yes, I know he's brilliant.
But is he lucky?"
The emperor knew the value of luck.
Our Roy seems to have it.
- Then make me a general, sir.
- Patience, my dear boy, patience.
Now this is our Corporal Miller.
A chemistry professor in private life.
An absolute genius with high explosives.
He blew up Rommel's headquarters...
...with no damage to the orphanage next door.
They don't come any better. We tried to make him an officer. He refused.
This is "Butcher" Brown, our mechanical marvel.
He's a genius with engines, machinery, radios, et cetera.
And the best man with a knife
I've ever met.
He got his training in Spain. The boys call him the Butcher of Barcelona.
Private Spyro Pappadimos.
What's his particular genius?
He's a born killer. A useful man to have along on a job like this.
His father happens to be our chief resistance contact on Navarone.
The boy went to America to get an education.
I'm afraid he got the wrong kind.
Well, there's the team.
Pirates and cutthroats, every one of them.
And of course, there's Lucky here.
And the redoubtable Mr. Stavros and yourself.
With every one of us a genius, how can we fail?
You can't.
We're sending six destroyers through the Navarone Channel next Tuesday...
...to take the men off Kheros.
If those guns aren't spiked by then...
...there'll be six more ships at the bottom of the Aegean.
There's your car, gentlemen.
Surprised?
I didn't think I'd see you again so soon.
You thought you'd have to look for me?
When the time came,
I would find you.
What is this?
We have to ferry some operators to an island called Navarone.
- Do you know it?
- I know it.
I also know I have work to do on Crete.
- Who's responsible for this?
- A major I used to know.
Name of Franklin.
He's a man who still has to prove to himself he's a hero.
I'll speak to Franklin.
Where do I find him?
That's the man.
You can speak with him on the way.
Think they've got a chance?
Frankly, no.
Not a chance in the world.
I'll be surprised if they get halfway to Navarone.
It's just a waste of six good men.
However, it doesn't matter, considering how many have been wasted already.
I'm glad it's not my decision.
I'm only the middleman.
Still, they may get there and they may pull it off.
Anything can happen in a war.
In the middle of absolute insanity...
...people pull out extraordinary resources.
Ingenuity, courage, self-sacrifice.
Pity we can't beat the problems of peace in the same way.
It would be so much cheaper.
I never thought of it in just that way.
- You're a philosopher.
- No.
I'm just the man who has to send people out on jobs like this one.
Must have been delayed.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.
- Major Franklin?
- Right.
My name's Baker. Sorry I was delayed.
Come with me, please.
It's been so comfortable,
I hate to leave.
When you're all quite ready...
Charming.
Just like an English country hotel.
Where does everybody else sleep?
Nobody sleeps. On your feet, professor. We've got homework to do.
If you insist, major.
What are you doing, friend?
Looking for dust?
No, friend. Microphones.
This is the British Army Post.
Don't you trust anyone?
No. That is why I have lived so long.
Mr. Stavros is Colonel Stavros of the Greek 19th Motorized Regiment.
- He outranks us all.
- It is of no moment.
The 19th Regiment no longer exists, for the time being.
- I beg your pardon, colonel.
- Andrea.
Please continue.
Right. If you're ready, corporal.
Yes, sir. Ready, sir.
Ready, willing and able, sir.
Champing at the bit.
Captain Mallory and Andrea...
...are responsible for getting us to where we're going.
I'll tell you where it is, and why we're going.
That is, if you really want to know, professor.
I'm all ears, sir. All ears.
We must avoid the coast road.
That means a 12-mile trek...
...to St. Alexis, where Resistance people from the town of Mandrakos...
...will come and meet us if they can make it.
Any questions?
I have an alternative route to that place.
May I borrow your pencil, please?
Does the major think this is possible?
I see.
That's a thought, isn't it?
Well, let's re-examine the plan and see if we have any alternative.
Watch out!
- How long has he been there?
- I heard something 10 minutes ago.
I thought my ears were playing tricks.
Then I heard it again.
Ten minutes?
Brown, go and get Major Baker.
Yes, sir.
What's your name?
What are you doing here?
The major asked you a question!
Answer the major.
Sounds like Kurdish.
I don't understand it.
I'll try Greek.
- Translation, please.
- He doesn't speak English.
Why was he listening?
- What are you doing to that man?
- You know him?
That's Nicolai, our laundry boy.
Is he the reason I've been disturbed?
I've had a hard day!
Does his job involve listening at keyholes?
- I don't believe it.
- We caught him at it.
It was just idle curiosity.
He doesn't speak English.
Why does he listen?
And why did he try to stab this man?
I presume he was trying to defend himself.
In this part of the world, carrying a knife doesn't make you a criminal.
Let him go.
Major Baker, arrest this man and hold him incommunicado for a week.
After that, my advice is you kick him out of Castelrosso.
Who the hell are you to give me advice, major?
Then I'm asking you as a favor.
I'll consider it.
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
I said, let him go!
Pappadimos, have you got your silencer?
- Yes, sir.
- Then use it. Shoot the laundry boy!
Are you crazy?
And if the major gets in your way, shoot him too.
That's an order.
Captain, he's insane!
Surely you won't let him do this.
I can't stop him, he's in charge.
Anyway, I agree with him.
Of course, he doesn't have to shoot you.
He can just call our HQ and you'll be on a troopship home, as a private...
...unless you give him your word that you'll do exactly as he says.
All right.
If it means that much to you, you have my word.
Take him, sergeant!
Stupid theatricals.
You're entitled to your opinion...
...but I just saved your life.
I'm desperately sorry, gentlemen.
Really, I am.
It's embarrassing.
Just look at it!
No, it's exactly what we want.
They said you wanted a boat no one would notice, but that's a disgrace!
Give me 36 hours, and I know I can lay my hands...
...on a German E-boat in absolutely perfect condition.
I promise you, only one careful owner.
I can pop over to Rhodes and get it for you.
Won't the Germans have something to say about that?
I suppose so, if they knew.
But I've got good connections there.
What do you say?
- No, thanks. We can't wait.
- Pity.
I'll get my chaps to help with your gear.
No, that's all right, thank you.
Right. I get it.
Special cargo and all that, what?
Well, good luck to you.
Brown?
Yes, sir?
What do you think?
Well, she's a bit of a monster, sir.
But I think I've got her worried.
- Comfortable, professor?
- Yes, thank you.
Matter of fact, the boys have almost finished.
Permission to speak?
- What about?
- Well, the condition of this vessel.
Talk to Captain Mallory.
He's in charge of transportation.
Very good, sir.
I've inspected this boat and I think you ought to know...
...I can't swim.
I'll keep it in mind.
Dead on 10, sir.
Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.
Report my signal. Report my signal.
Hello, George-Mike-William.
George-Mike-William.
Strength three. Strength three, over.
Hello, Lucky.
High Flight reports Indians on warpath
in your territory.
So please be careful.
Also, severe storms expected
throughout your area tonight.
Repeat. High Flight reports
Indians on warpath...
Hey.
Ship ahoy!
Go on working.
They'll have glasses.
Lower your sails!
Lower your sails!
We are coming aboard!
It's knee-deep in the hold, but I think we'll manage.
You want a breather?
Wouldn't mind.
Funny the way that German officer spoke English to us back there...
...almost as if he knew who we were.
I had the same thought.
I think our friend Baker may have some explaining to do.
I shouldn't have done it.
What's that?
Dragged you into this.
I'm sorry.
Forget it. I was getting tired of Crete food anyway.
No, I'm stupid sometimes.
Even as a kid, I'd expect people to play the games I liked.
Then I'd get furious when they didn't.
Well, now they have to, so why worry?
Hot coffee!
That's good.
I'm sorry, captain.
There's a serious shortage of cups aboard this ship.
I pointed out deficiencies in this vessel.
I remember.
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.
Any time you want another chat, about this boat, I mean, I'm available.
All right.
And I still can't swim.
Don't mind him.
He doesn't mean anything.
I don't mind him as much as he seems to mind me.
Have you been together long?
Since the beginning out here.
He's the best friend I have in this part of the world.
That's a pretty good partner you've got there yourself.
Yes.
- We've been together a long time too.
- You're lucky.
He's going to kill me when the war's over.
- You're not serious.
- Yes, I am.
So's he.
About a year ago, I gave a German patrol a safe conduct...
...to get their wounded into hospital.
I still had some romantic notions about fighting a civilized war.
Anyway, they wanted Andrea pretty badly even then.
They shot their casualties, went to his house and blew it up.
He was out on a job, but his wife and three children were in the house.
They were all killed.
I helped him to bury them.
He didn't say a word to me.
Never looked at me.
But after it was over, he said that as far as he was concerned...
...it wasn't the Germans who were responsible, but me.
Me and my stupid
Anglo-Saxon decency.
He said what he was going to do, and when.
Do you think he still means to do it?
He's from Crete.
Those people don't make idle threats.
I thought I was getting leave.
I was going to ask for transfer to another area.
Take some time to think, get ready for him.
And I messed that up.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
It's gonna be a long war.
What makes you sure he's gonna wait that long?
I'm not. Not if he gets the right opportunity.
What I'm banking on is, that now all he wants to do is to kill Germans.
As long as I can be useful to him in that department...
...he'll do his best to keep me alive.
I hope.
That's nice of him.
Well, I can see his point.
The only way to win a war is to be just as nasty as the enemy.
I'm only worried we'll find out we're even nastier than they are.
I can't say that worries me.
Well, you're lucky.
Think I better have a look at the hold.
Before Miller tells me to!
Help!
We've saved the explosives...
...the guns...
...and most of the ammunition.
I'm afraid we've lost the food and the medical supplies.
But if we rendezvous with the Resistance...
...at St. Alexis, they'll supply us with both.
Let's get out of this place as quickly as we can.
Pappadimos and Miller, you'll have the first shift with the stretcher.
You're officially taking command, sir?
Yes, I suppose I am. Why?
Just for the record.
This afternoon on the boat...
...you fumbled your job.
How'd that happen?
I don't know, sir.
The man was a foot away from you.
You only wounded him.
How could you miss?
I must have hesitated, sir.
You hesitated?
A man of your experience?
The Butcher of Barcelona?
How could you hesitate?
Well, I was tired.
I'm tired and I'm fed up.
I've been fighting this war a long time.
I've been killing Germans since 1937.
There's no end to them.
Shoot a man at 200 yards, he's just a target.
You kill him with a knife...
...you're close enough to smell him.
I smell them in my sleep.
After the last time, I made a pact with myself: I'd do my job.
But I wouldn't do the other anymore.
Not if I could help it.
And who gave you the right to make a private peace?
You think you're the only one who's tired?
I do my job, sir!
Your job is to kill enemy soldiers.
There will, of course, be a code word.
If we don't answer, a patrol will be here in no time.
Let's pack and get out.
Let's go.
Well?
The major's leg is broken in two places.
He could be hurt inside too.
He needs medical attention.
What do you suggest?
- Leave him for the Germans.
- They'd get him to a hospital.
If he doesn't get sulphanilamide, he doesn't stand a chance.
Naturally, you all think a lot of Major Franklin. So do I.
We have two choices.
We can take him, and if he doesn't get help, he'll die.
Or we can leave him here, and he'll tell the Germans everything.
Roy? Never!
He might not be able to help himself.
They have other drugs besides sulpha.
All they have to do is use scopolamine, and he'll tell them our whole plan.
There is, of course, a third choice.
One bullet now. Better for him.
Better for us.
You take that man along, you endanger us all.
Why not drop him off the cliff and save a bullet?
And why don't you shut up?
Yes, there's a third choice.
We'll make it if necessary...
...when it's necessary...
...and not before!
Now let's move!
Brown, from now on your job is to look after Major Franklin.
I said, move!
Morning!
I'm sorry.
Don't be silly. It's just bad luck.
Well, what do we do now?
Where are we?
We're on our way.
- I'm going to hold you up.
- No, you won't.
Anyway, the professor won the toss and he's dying to carry you.
That's right. You're not nearly as heavy as I thought.
Now look...
...you've got to leave me.
You're out of your mind.
It's radio time.
Well, it's all on your plate now.
You'll never be able to thank me enough.
I wanted the job all the time.
Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.
Report my signal.
Hello, George-Mike-William.
George-Mike-William.
Strength four. Strength four, over.
Hello, Lucky. This is most urgent.
Paddington Station will close
at midnight, X minus one.
Do you understand?
X minus one, over.
We've lost a full day.
Germans are gonna hit Kheros a day ahead of time.
Gives us until midnight, the day after tomorrow.
Message understood.
Message understood. Over and out.
I'd like to be alone with the major.
Roy, that was foolish.
You almost ruined everything.
We've just heard, we're canceled out.
Scrubbed.
What?
They're going for an amphibious landing the day after tomorrow...
...on the east coast.
The Turkish side.
The Turkish side?
And they're coming in force.
As far as we're concerned, the pressure's off.
All we have to do is make as much trouble as we can.
By tonight, we'll have you in the hands of the underground.
We'll have you taken care of.
Try this again, I'll have Andrea break your other leg.
Good luck.
Do not worry.
I shall see you tonight at St. Alexis.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Obviously, this place has been used before.
Any food around?
I regret to say no.
Weren't you careless?
We might have been anyone.
I heard you coming five minutes ago.
No.
No!
Pappadimos, it's time to relieve Andrea.
I'll take it.
No.
Pappadimos...
...you go.
- Maybe he brought food.
- Hold it.
He might be faking.
Saved!
Don't move!
Raise your hands!
Raise your hands high!
All of you!
You there, with the food, speak!
You are not Germans.
Which of you is Major Franklin?
The man on the stretcher.
Who are you?
My name is Maria Pappadimos.
You may put your hands down now, gentlemen.
Pappadimos?
They said Pappadimos was a man.
My father.
He was taken two days ago.
He was taken?
He told them nothing.
He will die first.
- You have sisters or brothers?
- A brother, Spyro, in America.
Oh, he's not as far away as all that.
He's that handsome devil right over there.
Spyro!
Why did you do that for?
To remind you to write letters occasionally.
- There's a war on!
- I mean before the war!
I promised myself I would do this the first time I saw you again.
Well, I'm sorry, brother.
Which of you did this?
Well...
I'm afraid it was me.
- Who is she?
- My friend, Anna. She's one of us.
It's bad that this happened to her.
Before the Germans came, she was a schoolteacher in Mandrakos.
Last year, she was caught. They tortured her to make her betray us.
They whipped her until the white of her bones showed.
Some nights, we could hear her screaming.
Then they kept her in the fortress for six months.
When they let her go...
...she could not speak.
She has never spoken since.
Not even in her dreams.
Even I have never been allowed to see the scars on her back.
But she's a good fighter.
As good as any of you!
Like a ghost, she goes anywhere!
She got us these guns.
And she kills without mercy.
You are very lucky, brother.
No, they are the friends! Our friends!
It's gangrene, sir.
If the leg doesn't come off, he'll die.
Does he know?
I don't think so.
Sir...
...I beg your pardon, but I haven't had a chance to talk to you alone.
I don't want to be left out anymore.
I want to be part of the team again.
Please give me a chance.
You can trust me.
I'll think it over.
That's gangrene! What choice do we have now, captain?
- Who relieved you?
- She did.
- In future, take orders only from me.
- I asked you a question, sir!
And I heard you, corporal.
Get yourself something to eat.
That's an order.
Thank you, sir.
There's a lot of activity down there.
I can hear it.
They're turning Mandrakos inside out.
As soon as they move out, we'll move in.
We're gonna get you to a doctor.
Brown says that you are doing well.
Brown is a liar. And so are you.
I haven't lost my sense of smell, you know.
I just hope the doctor's a good surgeon.
I wonder what old Jensen would say?
My luck seems to have changed, doesn't it?
I don't suppose I'll ever be a general now.
This Franklin...
...he's not a bad fellow.
No, not bad at all.
- You're sure there's a tunnel there?
- They'll never find us.
Well, they found us here.
Let's go. Let's go!
Oh, excuse me.
- Where is this tunnel?
- Up here, sir.
Where does this lead to?
We'll come out just behind Mandrakos.
All right.
Let's keep going.
Anna?
Anna?
You're limping. Are you hurt?
Do you need help?
Thank you, old bean.
Get off your behinds.
Think there's a fire escape?
These are fine people.
Give up quietly, gentlemen.
Unless you want many innocent people killed, as well as yourselves.
Turn around, please.
Captain Mallory, you've made a remarkable effort.
Unfortunately, it was doomed from the beginning.
Will you tell me where you've hidden your explosives?
No.
As your commanding officer, Captain
Mallory must play a heroic role.
You needn't carry such a burden.
You've all suffered a great deal.
Why prolong that suffering?
For you, the war is over.
Another officer is coming to question you. A captain in the SS.
His methods, quite frankly, are most severe.
None of you are in uniform.
Therefore, you're considered spies.
You know the penalty for espionage.
But if any one of you has the courage to tell me where the explosives are...
...I promise, you will not only save your own life...
...but the lives of your comrades.
This will be your only chance.
I do advise you to take it.
Please, sir! I am no spy!
I am not one of them!
You yellow--
Go on.
Sir, I swear to you, sir...
...I'm just a poor fisherman.
Two days ago these men killed my sailors and stole my boat.
They forced me to join them.
Sir, I am their prisoner!
Where did you learn your English, fisherman?
In Cyprus, sir.
I swear to you, it's true.
Aren't you Andrea Stavros?
Colonel Stavros?
Oh, no. No, sir.
My name is Nondus Salonikus.
I told you,
I'm a fisherman from Cyprus.
Then how do you happen to wear a shoulder holster?
They forced me to wear it...
...and made it a kind of joke.
Where are the explosives?
I swear, sir...
...I would tell you if I knew.
But, see, they didn't say.
The truth is, sir, they don't trust me.
I don't blame them.
The commandant will telephone to congratulate you, Muesel.
Thank you.
I've questioned them about the explosives, but they refuse to answer.
The Greek claims he is not one of them.
Now you! You are not of this company, you say?
No, sir, I'm not.
You are a liar!
- But Your Excellency--
- A liar!
Come, come. That didn't hurt.
- Where are the explosives?
- I don't know, Your Excellency.
Your Excellency,
I swear I do not know!
I am not one of these men!
They forced me to join them.
As I explained to the captain...
...I'm just a...
...poor fisherman from Cyprus.
My name is...
...Nondus Salonikus.
I swear to you.
These men stole my boat and then they forced me to join them.
Your Excellency--
Your Excellency, I am their prisoner!
Where are the explosives?
I want an answer now, or I'll personally rearrange this officer's splints.
Very well.
I can't!
Please, I can't!
I can't!
- Get up!
- I'm sick! I'm sick!
- Get up!
- Please! Oh, I'm sick!
But I'm sick! No, please!
Please, I'm sick!
I'm sick! I'm sick!
Call the sentry in.
Now, Oberleutnant...
...get on the phone.
Tell them you're not to be disturbed until you give further orders.
Remember...
...I speak German...
...perfect.
Not very hygienic, I must say.
Shocking taste in undies too.
Ah, well...
Heil, everybody!
Roy...
...we're gonna leave you here.
I understand.
We're gonna let them chase us around for a while.
But the one thing they mustn't know...
...is about the landing tomorrow night.
Of course.
Don't worry.
Oh, thanks.
Good luck.
Hold it.
We'll leave Major Franklin behind.
He's a wounded officer.
I expect him to get medical attention.
We don't make war on wounded men.
We're not all like Hauptmann Sessler.
Now, where's the camp radio station?
I will not tell you.
You wouldn't hesitate to kill me for any number of reasons.
But not this one.
In any event, I will not tell you.
- So long, Roy.
- Good luck, Keith.
Well, Lucky, I shall miss you.
Try to be a bad patient, will you?
Keep on asking for bedpans.
Drives them mad.
I'll keep it in mind.
When this is over, you'll buy me a lunch.
Roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, a nice little red wine...
Steak and kidney pie.
Anything you say.
You'll be paying for it.
And you, colonel, what a performance.
All right.
I hope you were right to leave
Franklin with the Germans.
Sir?
- Yes?
- No, not you, sir. Mr. Stavros.
Tell me about yourself.
- What do you want to know?
- Are you married?
I have been married.
My wife and children were killed.
Have you killed many people?
Only Germans.
Oh, some Italians too.
- Captain Mallory?
- Yes?
You are a lucky man.
Yes, I know.
- Mr. Stavros?
- Yes?
I like you.
I like you too.
I don't know.
Well, baby face,
I never would have known you.
You better get rid of that fuzz under your nose.
No, I'm an officer, remember?
You just picked the wrong uniform.
Lights out in five minutes.
I want you as well-rested as possible.
Now, first thing in the morning...
...we'll ditch the truck and get hold of another car.
Then we'll pick up the explosives and go into Navarone.
We've got to be inside the fortress by 10:00 tomorrow night.
Might one inquire how?
We're gonna walk in.
Simply because of this masquerade?
No.
Because I told Franklin our orders had been changed.
That we weren't after the guns.
That we were just to create a diversion for an assault...
...tomorrow night on the Turkish side.
Now, if my hunch is right, the Germans will give him scopolamine...
...and that's what he'll tell them.
They may not believe it, but they'll be faced with the fact that he does.
Now I'm gambling that they'll clear out of Navarone...
...and take up positions on the coast.
Very clever.
But that still leaves the garrison inside the fortress...
...and we get them out by having
Andrea, Pappadimos and Brown...
...start up diversions all over Navarone.
If there's enough confusion going...
...Miller and I should have a chance to break in.
At the same time, the girls will steal the fastest boat they can find...
...so we all have a chance of getting out when this thing is over.
Very clever, indeed.
Suppose they don't have any scopolamine? What happens then?
Suppose they use the old-fashioned methods?
Suppose your ventriloquist's dummy just won't talk...
...because he's a good man?
He won't be easy to break!
He may take a lot of punishment before he tells them our plan!
He may even die on them and tell them nothing at all!
Have you considered that?
Yes, I have.
I'll bet you have!
I'll bet you've considered that as far back as the cliff!
You and your...
...three choices.
I'll bet that's why you dragged him around with us all this time!
If he lives, he'll never be the same again!
Do you know what you've done?
You've used up an important human being!
Oh, I misjudged you.
You're rather a ruthless character,
Captain Mallory.
I didn't think of it back on the cliff.
But if I had...
...I'd have done the same thing.
It's our only chance!
Well, right now I say to hell with the job!
I've been on 100 jobs, none of which altered the war.
There've been 1000 wars and there'll be 1000 more, until we're all dead.
I don't care about the war anymore.
I care about Roy!
And if Turkey enters on the wrong side?
So what? Let the world blow itself to pieces, as it deserves!
What about the 2000 men on Kheros?
I don't know them.
But I do know the man on Navarone!
Mr. Miller, the man was finished when he fell.
That's easy for you to say, sitting there, drinking coffee!
It's funny. I was grateful when you left him behind today.
I just hope before this job's over...
...that I get the chance to use you the way you've used him.
I'm sorry, but I couldn't think of any other way.
Everybody get a good night's sleep.
No matter how it goes tomorrow...
...you're gonna need it.
I'll take the first watch.
Hello.
Tell me, schoolteacher...
...from a purely moral point of view...
...bearing in mind that we represent goodness and civilization...
...do you think that what I did was a civilized thing to do?
Scopolamine.
They are burning Mandrakos...
...in punishment.
This part of town has been evacuated...
...because the guns' vibrations has weakened the houses.
Where will the attacks come?
On the Turkish side.
What time?
What time?
Is the timetable clear?
Any questions?
Good luck.
I won't be needing this. You take it.
Spyro.
Andrea.
Everybody stay where you are.
The party's over.
Somebody's stepped on the cake.
Exhibit A: A clockwork fuse.
Elementary and archaic, but they work.
This one won't work anymore.
Know why?
The clock's okay, but the contact arm's broken off.
It could tick until Christmas and not even set off a firecracker!
Exhibit B:
Exhibit B is missing.
All my slow burning fuses are gone.
Disappeared! Vanished!
Exhibit C: My time pencils.
75 grains of fulminate of mercury in each of them.
Enough to blow my hand off.
And very unstable, very delicate.
Which means there's a traitor in this room.
You're crazy.
It happened at base.
No, I'm not that crazy!
I checked it all before I left base.
No, here.
Here!
Someone here.
But who?
Who?
This stuff's only been out of my sight two times.
Once was when Andrea and Maria took it away to hide it.
But it was all right when we picked it up again.
The only other time was when we left it in the truck...
...and we scouted the gates.
All of us!
Except her.
We left her on guard in the truck...
...alone.
You are crazy, sir!
Let me just think for a moment.
Since we got here, we've jumped out of one frying pan into another.
Just think...
We were hiding in the carob grove...
...and she's up in a tree. Remember?
Anybody can signal an airplane with tin or a mirror.
And they found us there, didn't they?
And then in the tunnel.
In the tunnel she lagged far behind, with a shocking limp.
Seen her limping lately?
But being behind us, she could leave some messages.
So when you take Roy to the doctor, the Germans are waiting for you.
When she takes us to her place, they come there.
But she got us out.
Of course! That house would be a shambles and she'd be dead with us.
So, what does she do?
She disappears into the bedroom to change her clothes...
...and to leave a little note.
She takes us to the wedding and we're caught...
...because we can't get to our guns!
But even if we can, we slaughter half of Mandrakos!
You are an insane man!
Am I?
Maybe I am.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
We can settle this thing very easily.
Let's see those scars the Germans made on her back...
...those terrible scars.
How about it, Maria?
Don't you want to see those scars?
Q.E.D.
You cannot believe it?
Believe it.
I cannot stand pain.
It's easy to be brave when you're free, when you're with friends.
But I was caught.
The others were free but they didn't help me. I was alone.
I was alone in their hands.
They said they would put me into their brothels.
They said they would torture me.
I saw what they did to other people.
I'm sorry.
I cannot stand pain.
When we got here...
...why didn't you put in with us?
You could have come with us!
It was your only chance to get free of them!
There was never any chance.
You never had any chance!
It was hopeless from the beginning.
You'll never get out of here!
Never!
I tried to tell you last night.
Can you do anything at all?
I don't know.
There's always some way to blow up explosives.
The trick is not to be around when they go off.
But aren't you forgetting something, captain?
The lady.
As I see it, we have three choices:
One, we can leave her here.
But she might be found.
And in her case they won't need a truth drug.
Two, we take her with us.
But that makes things more difficult.
And three...
Well, that's Andrea's choice.
Remember?
You really want your pound of flesh.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
I just couldn't manage to get to sleep last night.
- If you're anxious to kill her, do it!
- I'm not anxious to kill her.
I'm not anxious to kill anyone.
See, I'm not a born soldier.
I got trapped.
You may find me facetious...
...but if I didn't make some bad jokes,
I'd go out of my mind.
No, I prefer to leave the killing to you.
An officer and a gentleman.
A leader of men, a hero.
If you think I enjoy this, you're mad!
I never wanted it.
I was trapped like you, or anybody in uniform.
You wanted it.
You're an officer, aren't you?
I'll never want the responsibility of an officer.
Then you've had a free ride all this time.
Someone's got to be responsible.
Do you think it's easy?
I don't know!
I'm beginning to wonder who is responsible to do the dirty work.
Is the man who gives the orders guilty, or the one who has to do it?
- We've no time for this.
- Now just a minute!
If we're gonna get this job done, she has got to be killed!
And we all know how keen you are on getting the job done.
I've never killed a woman before, traitor or not...
...and I'm finicky.
So why don't you do it?
Why don't you let us off for once?
Come on, be a pal.
Be a father to your men.
Come down off your cross, close your eyes and pull the trigger!
What do you say, sir?
You all know what you have to do. Get started.
Brown, you go with Maria.
Now, you know when you put on a uniform and learn how to do it...
...it's not hard to kill anyone.
Sometimes it's harder not to.
You think you've been getting away with it all this time, standing by.
Well, son...
...your "bystanding" days are over.
You're in it now, up to your neck!
They say you're a genius with explosives. Start proving it!
You got me in the mood to use this thing...
...and by God, if you don't think of something, I'll use it on you!
I mean it.
Go on.
You stay here.
I'll call you if I need you.
Whatever you say, sir.
Spyro!
Spyro!
Detonators, sir, please.
I'll be finished here in about
30 seconds.
Miller?
Miller!
- Miller!
- Yes, what is it?
What are you doing?
They'll search those guns first and find my stuff.
They're not stupid.
But if they remove it carelessly, they could have the same result.
But I'm banking on this job being our insurance.
- What happens?
- Would you bring down the hoist?
Whoa, that's enough!
See this bottom runner?
When they send this hoist down for shells or charges, it'll come here.
It'll hit these two wires and we get a circuit...
...that'll send up all my plastic explosives here...
...plus this little item...
...that I borrowed here.
They won't see these wires under the grease.
Are you sure it'll work?
No guarantee, but the theory's perfectly feasible.
But if this stuff goes up...
...everything else in this place will go up with it.
Suppose you don't get a contact?
Then I'll be responsible for sinking one of the destroyers...
...maybe the whole lot of them.
I'm sorry, sir. it's the only way
I know to get the job done.
As you said, I'm in it now...
...up to my neck.
Hurry up.
- Go ahead.
- After you.
Remember? I can't swim.
You won't let me drown, will you?
I can't make it.
My arm...
Come on, man. Take it!
Grab it!
Spyro's dead, isn't he?
What happened?
He forgot why we came here.
And now you're going back to Crete?
Yes.
Come with us.
With us?
With me.
I must go back.
You saw what the Germans did to Mandrakos.
Navarone will pay heavily for your success tonight.
Come on,
I'll give you a hand.
I'm going back.
The job is finished.
Your job is finished.
What chance do you think you have of staying alive back there?
I'm not so easy to kill.
Hey.
Well, the boys on Kheros will be happy soon.
It'll be crowded, but there's nothing like an ocean voyage:
Fresh air, good food, deck sports, pretty girls...
I'd like to offer you my apologies...
...and my congratulations.
The truth is,
I didn't think we could do it.
To tell you the truth, neither did I.
{3918}{3986}Now, boy,|I've told you time and again.
{3988}{4064}Now, listen to me. There's no horsing|around when the train's coming.
{4066}{4124}Do you hear me?|Now, go on, get away.
{4224}{4277}- Looks like she's on time.|- Yes, she is.
{5051}{5102}Harrington!
{5276}{5352}-Let me help you with that, little girl.|-Thank you.|-Watch your step.
{5354}{5429}Watch your step.|There you are, little girl.
{5626}{5706}So I have to go to the store.|You go get the luggage.|Be careful of the fresh eggs.
{5708}{5776}- They're wrapped in paper.|- Yes, dear.|- Ben?
{5778}{5854}- Yes, dear?|- I want you to write a letter|to the president of this railroad.
{5856}{5925}There were men smoking|in the parlour car. Disgraceful!
{5927}{5995}- I've taken his number.|- Yes, dear.
{6069}{6137}- Miss Pollyanna?|- Yes? Aunt Polly?
{6139}{6208}No, I'm Nancy. I work for your aunt|and I came here to fetch you.
{6210}{6269}Oh. How do you do?
{6271}{6342}- This is Mr Thomas, the gardener.|- How do you do?
{6344}{6392}Hello, young lady.
{6394}{6456}Oh, no, no, no.|Thomas will take that for you.
{6458}{6524}Oh. Put it in the back seat.|Oh, good afternoon, Mrs Tarbell.
{6583}{6672}- Is that Jenny Harrington's child?|- Yes, it is.
{6674}{6758}Doesn't look a thing like any of the|Harringtons. What's your name, girl?
{6760}{6815}- Speak up.|- Pollyanna Whittier, ma'am.
{6817}{6873}Well, you're a very fortunate|little girl.
{6875}{6946}Most children who have lost their|parents would end up in an orphanage.
{6993}{7052}- You know that, don't you?|- Yes, ma'am.
{7054}{7191}Well, thank your lucky stars for such|a good woman as your aunt taking you in.
{7193}{7242}- Yes, ma'am.|- Yes.
{7244}{7319}Well, see that|you're properly appreciative|and don't cause any trouble.
{7321}{7370}- Children really never realize--|- Ed?
{7372}{7417}- Uncle Karl!|- Much too long.
{7419}{7485}- It's good to see you.|- Oh, same here.|How's everything at the house?
{7562}{7627}Wait till Polly Harrington|hears about this!
{7891}{7975}Right up here in the back seat, honey.|There you are.
{8111}{8190}Nancy, what are you staring at?
{8192}{8265}Oh, nothing!|Nothing at all, sir.
{8895}{8952}- Think she'll want the car?|- I don't know if|she wants the car or not.
{8954}{9009}You'll have to ask her yourself.
{9342}{9393}Your aunt's waiting for you, miss.
{9518}{9580}Hurry up.|I haven't got all day!
{10071}{10122}Oh, Mr Thomas.|Please put that here.
{10124}{10198}All right, Nancy.|All right.
{10200}{10271}You wait here, miss,|and don't touch anything.
{10273}{10332}- Do you understand?|- Yes, ma'am.
{11361}{11430}Well, we had, uh, Matthew.
{11432}{11515}- Mark last week.|- Isaiah has some very good passages.
{11517}{11581}- Isaiah?|- Yes, that's more what I had in mind.
{11583}{11650}- Yes, Isaiah has some|very good passages.|- What is it, Nancy?
{11652}{11714}Oh, excuse me, ma'am.|The little girl is here.
{11716}{11796}All right, show her in.
{11798}{11862}What you've been waiting for.
{11864}{11925}About the sermon, Reverend.
{11927}{11975}Yes.
{12030}{12127}Now, the transiency of life...
{12129}{12204}that-that fleeting,|ephemeral vapour...
{12206}{12278}it appeareth and it vanisheth--|James, the New Testament.
{12280}{12350}The perishability of our mortal bodies.
{12352}{12409}You want me to-- to weave a theme|of this into my sermon?
{12411}{12486}- Well, let me tell you what|my father said to Reverend Moffet.|- Yes. What did he say?
{12488}{12578}He said that you only have the|congregation for one short hour a week.
{12580}{12657}And there are six long days of mischief|for them before you get them again.
{12659}{12735}Aha! I see your point.
{12737}{12841}Strike hard on Sunday the excessiveness|of God's wrath and hope they carry it|with them a few days into the week.
{12843}{12904}- Exactly what I mean.|- Oh, yes, yes.
{13029}{13095}Well, come in, young lady.
{13097}{13145}Let's meet each other properly.
{13301}{13387}- I'm your Aunt Polly.|- How do you do?
{13389}{13463}This is the pastor of our church,|Reverend Ford.
{13465}{13557}How do you do?|Well, there's a family resemblance.
{13559}{13618}She looks very much like her mother.
{13620}{13673}Mother always used to say|I look like you!
{13726}{13832}Would you be good enough to stand|erect and in a proper manner, please?
{13869}{13928}And where in the world|did you get that dress?
{13990}{14068}It came in the missionary barrels.
{14070}{14158}- Missionary barrels?|- Yes. Her father was a minister.
{14160}{14257}As a matter of fact, he was|a missionary in the British West Indies.
{14316}{14407}Pollyanna, this is going|to be your new home...
{14409}{14472}and I hope you'll be|very happy with me.
{14576}{14646}I'm very sorry|about the dress, Aunt Polly.
{14648}{14704}My father said|it was a size too big...
{14706}{14804}but that I should be glad it wasn't|a pair of boys' trousers.
{14806}{14864}Well, that's hardly anything|to be glad about.
{14866}{14927}Well, my father always used to say|that people--
{14929}{15019}Yes, well, never mind|what your father used to say.
{15021}{15114}Supper is at 6:00 sharp, and no one|is ever late for meals at this house.
{15116}{15191}- Yes, ma'am.|- Nancy will show you your room.
{15342}{15390}I'm very glad you sent for me,|Aunt Polly.
{15511}{15589}Your home is very lovely.
{15591}{15639}Well, thank you.
{15727}{15784}It must make you awfully glad.
{15786}{15848}- Glad?|- That you're so very rich!
{16049}{16119}Honestly!
{16121}{16179}- Did I say something wrong?|- Well, let's just say...
{16181}{16277}there are about sixty-eleven things|you could have said besides that.
{16279}{16352}I run a clean kitchen.|No shenanigans in here.
{16354}{16410}And you clean up after yourself,|you hear me?
{16412}{16463}Yes, ma'am.
{16465}{16543}- You sure it was Doc Chilton?|- Mrs Tarbell saw him first!
{16545}{16643}Coming back after all these years!|D-Does she know yet?
{16645}{16708}- Old blabbermouth Tarbell|will see to that.|- Yeah.
{16710}{16799}Now, mind what you're doing and don't|spill your milk. Now, come along.
{16801}{16868}- You hurry up and change your clothes|and get back here. I need your help.|- All right, all right.
{16870}{16932}- And if you see Angelica,|tell her to come down here too.|- Okay.
{16934}{17033}- Leaving me all alone here.|- I'm very pleased to have met you,|Mrs Lagerlof.
{17035}{17083}- Mmm.|- Now come along.
{17352}{17412}Hello.
{17473}{17575}- What's his name, please?|- His name happens to be Elizabeth.
{17577}{17665}Oh! You're a girl!
{17667}{17761}- You're lovely.|- Now, leave her alone and come along.
{17812}{17861}How-- How do I address you, please?
{17863}{17927}Well, just call me Nancy,|same as everybody else.
{17929}{18000}Oh. And this is Angelica.|She's the upstairs maid.
{18002}{18054}- How do you do?|- Psst! Psst!
{18056}{18121}At the back porch.|You know who.
{18123}{18199}Now?|Oh, for heaven's sake.
{18201}{18251}Oh, Angie, would you show her|to her room, please?
{18253}{18332}- Well, I still have|two rooms left to do.|- I'll help you with|the bedrooms in the morning.
{18334}{18383}- All right, just this once.|- Come on. Come on.
{18498}{18587}Will you get out of here? Come on.|Hurry up. I've got work to do.|Now, come on and get up here.
{18612}{18682}I turn my back for one moment,|and what do you do? You disappear.
{18684}{18725}- And don't spill that milk.|- Yes, ma'am.
{18727}{18789}- I just got through|cleaning up this hall.|- Yes, ma'am.
{19132}{19223}- What are you doing now?|- Who lives in all these?
{19225}{19284}There's no one lives in them.|They're just there.
{19286}{19373}- What for?|- That's what being wealthy is.
{19375}{19426}You sure are a question-asker,|aren't you?
{19428}{19476}Now, hurry up.
{19840}{19888}Come on, come on.|Don't dawdle.
{20150}{20213}- Well, what's the matter?|- Nothing.
{20263}{20342}Oh! Stuffy!
{20344}{20390}Not much of a room, is it?
{20392}{20482}But it's my own anyway.|I'm glad of that.
{20602}{20676}Ooh, and the bed's soft.
{20678}{20739}And it's got a lovely window.
{21149}{21210}Who's that man down there with Nancy?
{21266}{21341}None of your business.
{21343}{21399}Just make sure|you're dressed in time for dinner.
{21472}{21527}You'd think she'd do better|than this for her own niece.
{21888}{21949}Almighty God,|we thank thee for thy bounty.
{21951}{22023}Grant unto us the grace|ever to live in dread of thee.
{22025}{22098}And bless this food unto our nourishment|that it may strengthen us...
{22100}{22151}to do thy will in all things.
{22153}{22210}Amen.
{22620}{22696}Oh, I'm sorry.
{22698}{22762}Nancy, would you bring|another glass of milk, please?
{22764}{22812}Yes, ma'am.
{22957}{23005}My-My clumsy old hand.
{23007}{23055}Well, now, there's no harm done.
{23121}{23220}- Did you find your room satisfactory?|- Oh, yes. It's very nice. Thank you.
{23222}{23317}You hadn't mentioned it,|so I just wondered.
{23319}{23421}I've never had a whole room|to myself before.
{23423}{23496}I must be higher up in the house|than anyone, aren't I?
{23540}{23598}Well, I'm not used to|children's noises around the house...
{23600}{23686}and that's the reason|I chose that one.
{23688}{23771}Oh, I'm--|I love it. I really do.
{23773}{23821}Really!
{24095}{24161}Aunt Polly?
{24163}{24214}Do you ever have steak and ice cream?
{24275}{24328}Are you complaining about the food?
{24330}{24389}Oh, no!|It's delicious!
{24391}{24449}I just wondered.
{24497}{24554}I love steak.
{24556}{24657}Father always used to say that if|we ever had the money you have...
{24659}{24779}we'd have steak and ice cream|three times every day!
{24781}{24881}Pollyanna, I think we ought to get|one thing straight right now.
{24883}{24987}I don't want you constantly quoting|what your father used to say.
{24989}{25037}Do you understand?
{25214}{25324}Nancy, I thought I made myself clear|about gentlemen callers.
{25326}{25393}- Ma'am?|- Now, don't pretend|you don't understand me.
{25395}{25445}I saw you and George Dodds|out in the summer house.
{25447}{25551}- George has been every inch|a gentleman with me, and it's not--|- We won't discuss it.
{25553}{25641}If you want to remain on my staff,|I don't want you to see him any more.
{25643}{25735}- Do you understand?|- Yes, ma'am.
{25854}{25929}This is no concern of yours.
{25931}{25985}You can finish your supper, Pollyanna.
{26120}{26181}In the fall, I'll introduce you|to Mr Bainbridge.
{26183}{26307}He's the principal of our school, and|he'll decide what grade you're to be in.
{26309}{26420}Pollyanna, I think we should talk about|you and your position in this community.
{26422}{26485}Do you know why|it's called Harrington Town?
{26487}{26552}My mother said it was named|after my grandfather.
{26554}{26603}That's right.
{26605}{26669}And everyone in this town looks to us|to set a good example...
{26671}{26782}in the way we conduct ourselves,|in our duties and manners...
{26784}{26837}in what we think|and even what we say.
{26839}{26918}So we must be good examples|for everyone in everything we do.
{26920}{26974}- Is that clear?|- Yes, Aunt Polly.
{26976}{27084}Just remember our family position and|conduct yourself properly and modestly.
{27086}{27174}Oh. You mean what I said before?
{27176}{27272}I understand that now.|I'll never say that again.
{27274}{27364}- You understand what?|- About the money.
{27366}{27471}I'm not supposed to be glad|we're so very rich, huh?
{27536}{27631}Well, uh, I think it's time for you|to get ready for bed, young lady.
{27795}{27869}- May I kiss you good night? Please?|- What?
{27907}{27968}Kiss you?
{28131}{28188}I love you, Aunt Polly.
{28269}{28322}Uh, just a moment, please.|Come back here.
{28435}{28483}Turn around once.
{28540}{28613}That dress is disgraceful.
{28615}{28727}Tomorrow we'll go into town|and get you some decent clothes.
{28729}{28788}- Store-bought?|- But of course.
{28790}{28836}Where else would we get them?
{28838}{28937}Out of an actual store?|New clothes?
{28939}{29015}Well, you're a Harrington now,|and I want you to look like one.
{29017}{29088}Yoo-hoo!
{29090}{29144}Pollyanna?
{29146}{29205}Walk up the stairs|like a lady, please.
{29597}{29664}Store-bought clothes!
{29666}{29719}What do you think of that, Elizabeth?
{29765}{29844}I wonder if she meant|new petticoats too.
{29846}{29915}And new garters|and stockings and underpants.
{30016}{30096}Don't tell anyone...
{30098}{30166}but it's wonderful|to be so rich, isn't it?
{33099}{33161}Nancy, something's come up.|I'm going with Mrs Tarbell.
{33163}{33259}- Would you please take Pollyanna home?|- Yes, madame.
{33261}{33330}Oh, I'll take that box, Pollyanna.
{33332}{33395}Now, get into the car, miss.
{33470}{33565}Oh, Pollyanna. Will you please get into|the car? We've simply got to get home!
{33567}{33613}Oh!
{33694}{33751}George, stop it!
{33831}{33943}Oh, Pollyanna, you don't know|my cousin Fred, do you?
{33993}{34069}- Your cousin Fred?|- This is Pollyanna Whittier.
{34071}{34167}Miss Harrington's niece.|The one who's come to live with her.
{34169}{34223}Oh. Oh, that one.
{34225}{34280}Hello, Pollyanna.|How are you, honey?
{34282}{34370}- Fine, thank you.|- Good.
{34372}{34461}Well, uh, how about this?|Running into you after all these--
{34463}{34560}- What's it been, six years?|Say, how's your ma and pa?|- Well, they're just fine.
{34562}{34632}You know, Pollyanna,|I don't take too much to relatives.
{34634}{34732}But this girl here, she was|always just like a sister to me.
{34734}{34869}- I tell ya, I love this cousin.|- Will you cut it out?
{34952}{35051}Uh-huh. Well, look, uh,|what are you girls doin'?
{35053}{35111}How'd you like to go down the street|and get a great big dish of ice cream?
{35113}{35159}- Huh?|- Oh!
{35161}{35225}Oh, no, that's a rotten idea. She|probably hates ice cream, doesn't she?
{35227}{35288}- Oh, probably.|- Who, me?
{35290}{35338}- Oh, no. I love it!|- Really?
{35340}{35389}You do?|Well, now, isn't that astounding?
{35391}{35447}How'd you ever develop|a taste for that awful stuff?
{35449}{35514}Oh, no, really!|I really do love it. I--
{35516}{35611}Well, I know a wonderful place.|Come on, girls.
{35613}{35688}Follow old cousin Fred|to the land of strawberry frappe.
{35690}{35750}Unless you'd rather go down|the street and have a beer.
{35752}{35819}You're funny.
{36135}{36205}Hey, you two,|get down off that truck right now.
{36207}{36297}How many times did I tell you|to keep away from the fire engine?
{36382}{36462}Hey, get on, there! Go on!|I'm not gonna tell you again.|Now, get off that ladder.
{36464}{36523}You-You see?|Right up there under the eaves?
{36525}{36588}-Just beyond the window is where--|- How'd it happen?
{36590}{36677}Oh, the pipes busted, Mayor. Both them|boilers went up at the same time.
{36679}{36754}- And before we knew it,|we was up to our necks in water.|- Mr Geary!
{36756}{36854}- Uh, comin'. Excuse me.|- Well, the children are safe,|thank goodness.
{36856}{36914}I warned you about this|and told you we should do something.
{36916}{36971}- Now, perhaps, you'll listen.|- I've asked everyone...
{36973}{37028}to meet at my house,|and we'll discuss this calmly.
{37030}{37118}A fine orphanage this is!|Water pipes busting all over the place.
{37296}{37370}Oh, Dr Chilton? Doctor, could you|have a look at Mr Geary's arm?
{37372}{37420}- Oh, just scalded it a bit.|- Of course.
{37422}{37489}- Is there a dispensary here?|- Yes, Doctor. This way.
{37840}{37896}I wonder what's going on.
{37898}{37956}Listen, miss, before we go in...
{37958}{38007}it might be just as well|not to mention...
{38009}{38091}about the ice cream to your aunt.
{38093}{38193}My father told me|never to tell a lie.
{38195}{38243}Pollyanna...
{38275}{38335}I didn't mean to tell a lie.
{38337}{38405}But there's no reason to bring up|the subject if it isn't mentioned.
{38407}{38512}- I mean, about cousin Fred and all.|- I like your cousin Fred very much.
{38514}{38579}Oh, he's all right, I guess.
{38581}{38688}He's very handsome,|and he has a nice smile.
{38690}{38747}But there's something sort of...
{38749}{38827}I don't know, funny about him.
{38829}{38921}What do you mean, funny?
{38923}{38988}I know what it is.|It's his name.
{38990}{39064}- He doesn't look at all like a Fred.|- What?
{39066}{39132}He looks more like a George to me.
{39134}{39202}Pollyanna! Wait a minute.
{39424}{39494}- Pollyanna, I told you|to come directly home.|- Yes, I know, but--
{39496}{39554}And know that when I tell you|to do something, you must do it.
{39556}{39642}There are rules-- Nancy, where have|you two been? It's almost 1 :00.
{39644}{39695}Well, uh, you see, ma'am--
{39697}{39789}Have you been carrying on|with George Dodds again?
{39791}{39883}- Oh, it was my fault, Aunt Polly.|- What do you mean, your fault?
{39946}{40042}Well, I-I just dawdled so.
{40044}{40116}It was the excitement|of the new dress, I suppose.
{40118}{40200}Polly, before Karl Warren|get's here, we must talk.
{40202}{40261}Oh, I suppose you're right.|Nancy?
{40332}{40386}Nancy, get into your uniform|and help with the luncheon.
{40388}{40479}- Yes, ma'am.|- And this is no place|for you, young lady.
{40481}{40544}- We have lots to do, so run along.|- Yes, Aunt Polly.
{40548}{40627}I'm sorry to start your vacation off|like this, Ed, but this won't take long.
{40629}{40681}Don't worry about me, Uncle Karl.|I'll just wait out here.
{40683}{40778}Fine. Fine.
{40780}{40847}Oh, Frieda, Bessie, they're waiting|for you in the conservatory.
{40849}{40897}Right in there, ladies.
{40934}{41028}Why, Edmond.|This is a surprise.
{41030}{41123}- Well, if it isn't young Dr Chilton.|- Mrs Tarbell.
{41196}{41303}- I'll see if everyone's|ready for you, Polly.|- Thank you.
{41305}{41397}It's nice to see you again.|Are you just visiting?
{41399}{41484}Well, I thought it was time for|vacation, the first one in five years.
{41486}{41578}I'm just waiting here for Karl.|I won't be in the way here, I hope.
{41580}{41628}No, no, of course not.
{41677}{41804}Seems strange,|being back here again like this.
{41830}{41904}Polly, they're all ready for you.
{41906}{41962}I'll be right there.
{42013}{42081}- Why don't you come in and join us?|- No, I'd rather not butt in.
{42083}{42167}I'll wait here.
{42169}{42219}- Well, they're waiting for me.|- Go ahead.
{42221}{42269}I'll be fine here.
{42559}{42629}- Hi, Nancy!|- Hi. You better get out of here.
{42631}{42685}Oh, I'm all right.
{42898}{42948}It should be parliamentary procedure,|same as it's always been.
{42950}{43023}- Well, for once, let's have facts.|- We always observe regular procedure.
{43025}{43073}Oh, bunkum!|We're here because of an emergency.
{43075}{43151}- Everybody will be talking|at the same time.|- Exactly!
{43247}{43309}- Hello.|- Hello.
{43311}{43400}- Is this the town meeting?|- Oh, no. It's in there.
{43402}{43490}-In the conservatory, for heaven's sake.|-Oh.
{43492}{43544}Are you a member|of the ladies aid group?
{43546}{43603}Oh, no. I'm just a child.
{43605}{43680}I'm not even supposed to be here.
{43682}{43753}- What's your name?|- Pollyanna Whittier.
{43755}{43826}That's my aunt over there,|the pretty one.
{43828}{43899}This is her house,|and I live with her.
{43979}{44061}Wait just a moment, everybody.|We'll compromise.
{44063}{44142}- We'll go to|the immediate problems first.|- Good.
{44144}{44257}Amelia, wouldn't you like to hear|what Karl has to say?
{44259}{44350}All I'm saying is that it's time|we took some pride in that orphanage...
{44352}{44438}and put up a decent, presentable|building that we could all be proud of.
{44440}{44509}That's all I'm saying,|and I've been saying it...
{44511}{44576}for three and a half long years!
{44845}{44949}Polly, he is completely|out of line on the whole thing.
{44951}{45049}If we'd all be a little more quiet,|cooperative, orderly.
{45051}{45099}If we'd all stop shouting|and cooperate--
{45101}{45193}There is nothing wrong with that|building! All it needs is new plumbing.
{45195}{45282}Today the plumbing, tomorrow|the roof and the Lord knows what--
{45284}{45366}Excuse me, Reverend.|Who knows what's gonna happen next?
{45368}{45437}You were very happy when my father|donated the building for the town.
{45439}{45515}Oh, for Pete's sake,|Polly Harrington, listen to reason.
{45517}{45581}It's a dilapidated old relic!
{45583}{45639}The dining hall, the dispensary.
{45641}{45719}Even my nephew, Dr Chilton there,|he noticed that.
{45721}{45811}Ed, tell them what you said.
{45813}{45869}Well, I don't think|I should say anything.
{45871}{45950}No, no. Now, come on. Tell them|what you said. I want them to hear it.
{45952}{46066}Well, I got a look at the dispensary|when I fixed Mr Geary's arm.
{46068}{46146}And I mentioned it seemed a little|inadequate for 32 children there.
{46148}{46237}There you are.|Now you've heard it.
{46239}{46354}We all thank you for your interest,|Edmond, but it's an equipment problem.
{46356}{46431}We're talking about Harrington House,|which is a landmark in this town...
{46433}{46492}and I intend to see that|it stays that way.
{46494}{46548}We'll spend more trying|to repair that old building...
{46550}{46622}-than it would cost to put up a new one.|-It won't cost this town one cent!
{46624}{46691}My father donated|the building to the town...
{46693}{46751}and I will stand the cost of the pipes|or the plumbing...
{46753}{46836}or whatever it is that's necessary.
{46838}{46900}It's my duty,|and I will not shirk it.
{46961}{47027}And I suppose there's not one of you|out there that has the gumption...
{47029}{47123}to stand up and say what you think,|is there?
{47125}{47196}What about you, Reverend? You're a man|of influence in this community.
{47198}{47284}- What do you think?|- No! No, no, I-I, uh--
{47286}{47343}I-I never take sides|in these matters.
{47345}{47411}That's comfortable. Ben?
{47413}{47491}Speak up. Come on.
{47493}{47547}Oh, Karl!
{47549}{47620}Charlie, what do you say?
{47622}{47719}Well, say something!|Anybody!
{47721}{47769}We do have other business to discuss.
{47771}{47841}- That is, if you've finished, Karl.|- Oh, yes, I've finished!
{47944}{48021}There's your whole town council|and your whole civic conscience!
{48023}{48072}And you certainly don't need me|as mayor around here as long as...
{48074}{48132}you've got Polly Harrington|running everything.
{48205}{48267}Karl never changes, does he?
{48269}{48339}Uh, ladies and gentlemen,|we're having a little light lunch.
{48341}{48390}Suppose we stop for a while|and have a bite.
{48481}{48575}If you ask me, Reverend Ford should|have taken sides with Mayor Warren.
{48577}{48655}He had the chance, and what'd he do?|He says he never|takes sides in these matters.
{48657}{48738}Oh, stop stickin' your nose|into their business and|get these sherbet glasses out there.
{48740}{48828}- We're out of spoons.|- Well, wash some up. Don't stand there|bellyaching to me about it.
{48830}{48883}You're in a fine mood,|aren't you?
{48918}{49011}Pollyanna, I thought you|could use this for your room.
{49013}{49114}Oh, thank you, Nancy!|Oh, it's gorgeous!
{49116}{49195}Oh, well, thanks for not spilling|the beans about you-know-who.
{49197}{49252}- About cousin Fred, you mean?|- Mm-hmm. Isn't he handsome?
{49254}{49313}- I knew it all the time!|- You did? How did you know?
{49315}{49379}Well, sure, it was easy! I saw you|holding hands under the table.
{49381}{49432}If you ladies got|nothing better to do...
{49434}{49482}than sit there|gossipin' and snickerin'--
{49484}{49555}- Well, we're just talking, Tilly.|- Well, talk on your own time.
{49557}{49646}- This sherbet's turning to mush.|- All right, all right.
{49712}{49788}- Nancy?|- Hmm?|- You know that man?
{49790}{49871}- What man?|- The one at the train station.
{49873}{49926}The one that was just here.
{49928}{49987}Well, what was he to Aunt Polly?
{49989}{50091}Well, you might say|they used to be friends sort of.
{50093}{50173}- You think he's gonna marry Aunt Polly?|- Who's gonna marry her?
{50175}{50241}- She means Dr Chilton.|- Huh!
{50243}{50333}Fat chance! Who'd want to marry|old pickle-faced Harrington?
{50335}{50414}Nancy, are you and George|gonna get married?
{50416}{50490}- Oh, we hope to someday.|- Oh, I am glad.
{50492}{50546}I think everyone should be married.
{50548}{50647}And maybe when|you do marry George...
{50649}{50768}Aunt Polly will see how happy you are|and she'll be very glad|to get married herself then.
{50770}{50829}Glad this, glad that!|Do you have to be glad about everything?
{50831}{50893}- What's the matter with you anyway?|- Oh, lay off her, Angie.
{50895}{50966}- She's not hurting you.|- Oh, the way she goes on.
{50968}{51032}Now, that's enough!|You heard what she said.
{51034}{51120}Stop pickin' on the girl.|Now, take that sherbet out|and serve it the way you should.
{51122}{51170}Go on!
{51239}{51313}Well, let's see what your aunt|has on the menu for tomorrow.
{51420}{51493}Roast chicken.|Chicken every Sunday.
{51495}{51553}Your aunt has no imagination.
{51555}{51639}Oh, I love roast chicken!|I'm glad tomorrow's Sunday.
{51641}{51705}Yeah. Wait till tomorrow.|You won't be so glad.
{51707}{51785}Did you ever hear of sour stomach?|Well, Sundays around here...
{51787}{51888}give folks sour stomach|for the whole rest of the week.
{51890}{51957}- How come?|- Wait till tomorrow.
{51959}{52011}You'll find out soon enough.
{52136}{52211}{Y:i}Praise him all creatures
{52213}{52286}{Y:i}Here below
{52288}{52434}{Y:i}Praise him above ye heavenly host
{52436}{52499}{Y:i}Praise Father, Son
{52501}{52629}{Y:i}And Holy Ghost
{52631}{52757}{Y:i}Amen
{53758}{53867}Death comes unexpectedly!
{53869}{53947}And the god,Jehovah,|will execute his vengeance on ye...
{53949}{54048}who despise his dying love|and trample his benefits underfoot.
{54050}{54126}The unconverted soul,|the foolish children of man...
{54128}{54205}do miserably delude themselves|in the false confidence...
{54207}{54284}of their own strength and wisdom.
{54286}{54408}They trust to nothing but a shadow.|But bear testament.
{54410}{54487}Death comes unexpectedly!
{54489}{54585}Now, you say, "Ah, no.|I-I had not intended it to come now.
{54587}{54660}I had laid out matters otherwise.|I thought my scheme good.
{54662}{54733}I intended to take effectual care,|but death came unexpectedly...
{54735}{54813}like a thief, outwitting me,|too quick for me.
{54815}{54896}Oh, cursed foolishness, that I had|flattered and pleased myself...
{54898}{54952}with vain dreams of repentance.
{54954}{55053}But sudden destruction|caught me up."
{55055}{55136}And now he will deal with you.
{55138}{55238}Now, the great king|of heaven and earth...
{55240}{55335}will abolish and annihilate|this pride!
{55337}{55451}Will crush the hardened wretch of|the polluted, infinite abomination...
{55453}{55500}and rain on him...
{55502}{55596}a deluge of fire and brimstone!
{55631}{55700}And where's their strength then?
{55702}{55799}Where are the great leviathans|who defy God then?
{55801}{55897}Where's their courage, these-these--|these-these proud spirits?
{55975}{56029}Yes...
{56031}{56134}death comes unexpectedly.
{56136}{56200}And the dread judge|has the key of hell.
{56202}{56323}He shuts, and no man opens.
{56325}{56364}In hell...
{56366}{56451}you will be reserved in chains|of darkness forever and ever.
{56453}{56551}This place of atonement,|of damned souls and misery...
{56553}{56617}with nothing to relieve you,|no comfort...
{56619}{56679}no water for your parched tongues...
{56681}{56732}no place to rest or take a breath...
{56734}{56850}but the everlasting,|infinite convulsions of misery...
{56852}{56907}forever...
{56909}{56980}and ever and ever!
{56982}{57049}Now, Isaiah has warned us...
{57051}{57160}on the day of vengeance,|the earth shall be laid to waste.
{57162}{57255}And the cormorant and the bittern|shall possess the land.
{57257}{57327}The raven and screech owl|shall dwell in it.
{57329}{57433}- Don't stare at the orphans, Pollyanna.|- And who is man...
{57435}{57519}to think he can withstand|God's mighty wrath?
{57596}{57697}Great mountains cannot stand|before this wrath.
{57699}{57817}Yea, he can lay the earth|to pieces in one moment...
{57819}{57926}or shatter the whole universe|with one stroke of his fiery sword.
{57928}{58003}How dreadful is the state of those|who are in daily danger...
{58005}{58055}of this great wrath...
{58057}{58129}this abyss of death and despair.
{58131}{58234}Yet, this is the dismal case...
{58236}{58341}of every soul in this congregation|who has not been born again...
{58343}{58448}however moral or strict, sober|and religious you may otherwise be.
{58450}{58516}There is no security|for the wicked...
{58518}{58619}because there are no visible signs|of death at hand!
{58621}{58672}Unconverted men...
{58674}{58750}walk over the pit of hell|on a rotten covering.
{58752}{58836}And there are innumerable places|on this covering so weak...
{58838}{58883}they will not bear their weight.
{58885}{58972}And these places cannot be seen.|The arrows of death fly...
{58974}{59042}unseen as noonday.
{59044}{59171}God has many different|unsearchable ways of taking|the wicked from this world.
{59173}{59301}Who here, in this congregation,|listening to this discourse...
{59303}{59427}will soon be visited|by this covenant of darkness?
{59429}{59532}There you are, sitting there...
{59534}{59655}calm in your knowledge of health,|secure in your well-being.
{59701}{59802}Yet who could suffer the agonies|of the damned of tomorrow?
{59804}{59893}Yes, even today|or maybe the next hour...
{59895}{59978}the next minute.
{59980}{60066}And if we were to know|which of you it was...
{60068}{60148}what an awful sight it would be.
{60150}{60242}A soul doomed...
{60244}{60341}to the everlasting bottomless pit|of a divine wrath!
{60343}{60389}Yes...
{60391}{60472}death comes unexpectedly!
{60539}{60593}Amen.
{61398}{61446}Exactly!
{61480}{61554}I thought the reference to Jeremiah|at the finish was very effective.
{61556}{61606}- Didn't you, Mrs Ford?|- Yes.
{61608}{61663}I, uh, sometimes wonder|whether it's necessary...
{61665}{61729}to talk so furiously at them though.
{61731}{61794}Dear, Isaiah,|Jeremiah and Ezekiel...
{61796}{61847}were all recorded with flaming pens|and fire.
{61849}{61907}I-I can't deliver the message|with syrup.
{61909}{61967}Of course not.|Your voice is God's instrument.
{61969}{62025}- It should be used accordingly.|- Well, we try our best.
{62027}{62097}What'd I tell ya?
{62099}{62189}He sure sermonizes something fierce,|doesn't he?
{62191}{62267}Brimstone and damnation|on top of ham and eggs!
{62269}{62351}- The one day a week we have off.|- I hate Sundays.
{62353}{62433}- Ooh, I just hate them.|- Breakfast still a hot ball|in our stomachs...
{62435}{62503}and him chewing our ears off|from that pulpit!
{62505}{62565}We're gonna have roast chicken though.|I'm glad of that.
{62567}{62660}Are you gonna start that all over again?|Glad this, glad that!
{62662}{62743}What is all this "glad" business|you talk about?
{62779}{62838}Oh, just a game I play.
{62840}{62921}What kind of a game?
{62923}{62992}A game my father taught me.
{62994}{63090}- It helps sometimes.|- Helps what?
{63092}{63140}When things aren't going so well.
{63142}{63216}- That reverend!|- Away from the peas. Go away.
{63218}{63285}Folks just hate the coming of Sunday|because of him.
{63287}{63337}Do you know why I hate Sunday?
{63339}{63397}Because it means|the starting of another week.
{63399}{63471}-That's true.|-That's when you can play the glad game.
{63473}{63523}Here it comes.
{63525}{63591}Miss Goody Two-Shoes is gonna find|something about Sunday to be glad about!
{63593}{63657}- Oh, lay off her, Angie.|- Oh, stop it!
{63659}{63752}If you knew how to play the game,|then you could find something|to be glad about too.
{63754}{63813}But you don't!
{63887}{64002}All right, Miss Smartie-Pants,|what's so good about Sunday?
{64004}{64065}- Well, there's always something.|- Huh!
{64126}{64198}You could be glad because--
{64200}{64263}Well, because what?
{64440}{64537}Because it will be six whole days|before Sunday comes around again, huh?
{64626}{64674}That kid.
{66082}{66143}Hi.
{66145}{66211}Why don't you come out of|the front door like normal people?
{66213}{66319}They won't let us. I can come out|anytime I want with my tree.
{66321}{66413}You can also fall and hurt yourself|badly. You shouldn't play in trees.
{66415}{66492}That's stupid.|Don't you believe in God?
{66494}{66560}Of course I do!|But what's that got to do with it?
{66562}{66682}He grew it there, didn't he,|so I could climb out anytime I want.
{66684}{66775}You're much too young|to go around discussing things|you don't know anything about.
{66848}{66939}He did too!|Why else would it be there?
{66941}{67006}Shows you're very juvenile.
{67008}{67114}You aren't so much, you girl!
{67116}{67190}Besides, I'm somethin' you can't be.
{67192}{67244}I'm an orphan.
{67246}{67316}Go away from me, please,|little boy.
{67318}{67389}"Go away from me, please, little boy."
{67391}{67442}What is it you want?
{67444}{67515}I wanna go fishin'.|You wanna come along?
{67582}{67636}Aren't you supposed to use a hook?
{67638}{67681}I don't have a hook.
{67683}{67731}Oh.
{69389}{69437}Hello.
{69439}{69526}- Well, look who's here. How are you?|- Fine, thank you.
{69528}{69604}- Caught anything?|- Not yet.
{69905}{69962}What was it you and|my Aunt Polly fought about?
{70091}{70186}Now, where did you hear about that?
{70188}{70293}Oh, just around. But they won't|discuss it when I'm there.
{70295}{70367}Um, would you mind|telling me what it was?
{70369}{70443}Well, Pollyanna,|it's a strange thing about arguments.
{70445}{70552}At the time, they seem very important.|But now--
{70554}{70615}You know, I can't even remember|what it was about.
{70617}{70665}Huh.
{70732}{70783}Aunt Polly's very pretty.
{70832}{70909}Yes, I think she is, don't you?
{70911}{70984}Yes. I just said so.
{71085}{71176}I love her, but I don't love|the way she fixes her hair.
{71178}{71300}Years ago, she used to wear it|long and soft down to her shoulders.
{71302}{71355}It was very soft.
{71357}{71448}It must've been beautiful.
{71450}{71504}Yes, it was very beautiful.
{71667}{71724}Did you used to be in love with her?
{71781}{71865}Come on, Pollyanna.|Let's go!
{71867}{71963}Reverend Ford and his wife|are with Aunt Polly now.
{71965}{72045}But they'll--|they'll be leaving soon.
{72047}{72175}I suppose Aunt Polly will be alone|by herself most of the afternoon.
{72177}{72231}Well, I-I'd better be going now.
{72233}{72281}Good-bye.
{72404}{72465}- You wanna know something?|- What?
{72467}{72527}Trees are the best things|in the world.
{72529}{72618}You can hide up in 'em and people|don't even know where you are.
{72620}{72705}- And they're walking right beneath you.|- I never thought much about it.
{72707}{72773}Well, they are.|You wanna see something?
{72775}{72841}- What?|- Come on. I'll show ya.
{73218}{73330}- It says, "Keep out."|- Shh! Ya gotta keep quiet.
{73801}{73853}- Ya see that place?|- What about it?
{73855}{73908}That's Old Man Pendergast's place.
{73910}{73984}He's the meanest man in town!
{73986}{74071}- Well, what are we doing here?|- Shh! Keep quiet.
{74279}{74330}Come on, Pollyanna.
{74491}{74564}This is his old, wet basement|with rats in it.
{74566}{74640}He hates kids.|If he catches ya...
{74642}{74752}he throws ya down in his basement|and keeps ya for his slave.
{74754}{74867}- Then what are we doing here?|- Because I wanna show ya something.
{75275}{75332}There it is.
{75334}{75383}Up there.
{75407}{75471}The best climbing tree in town!
{75533}{75582}Isn't it a beauty?
{75584}{75685}Why, of all the stupid little|juvenile tricks!
{75687}{75765}Do you mean to tell me that you|brought me all the way up here...
{75767}{75873}just to see a crummy old--|a crummy old tree?
{75875}{75958}Wait a minute, Pollyanna.|Don't you even want to climb it?
{75960}{76034}- No.|- Well, would ya give me a boost?
{76036}{76121}Aw, come on. Please?
{76152}{76206}All right.
{76208}{76291}All right. Up this way.|More. Come on. Higher.
{76293}{76393}A little bit higher.|Just a little bit more.
{76395}{76467}A little bit higher.|Right--
{76469}{76521}Right there.
{76523}{76574}- What are you doing here?|- Look out!
{76576}{76614}I've gotcha!
{76616}{76689}- Oh, you little--|- Lemme go!
{76691}{76753}- I've got you, you little devil.|Come back here, you little girl!|- Lemme go!
{76755}{76860}Come back here! You wicked little boy.|I'm gonna get the constable this time.
{76862}{76946}- Lemme go, lemme go!|- Shut up! I'll teach you.
{76948}{77012}- Lemme go!|- I'll teach you a lesson|you won't forget. Come here.
{77014}{77061}- Lemme go.|- Come on! Get up there!
{77063}{77117}Lemme go!
{77305}{77375}I want you children to understand|that I do not want you on my property.
{77377}{77460}- Keep away from me. Lemme go.|- Hey! Listen to me!|- You big bully, lemme go!
{77462}{77524}- I've told you 50 times|to keep out of that tree!|- Lemme go!
{77526}{77577}And I don't want you in the tree.|You hear me?
{77579}{77638}You keep away from me.|I wasn't hurtin' anything.
{77640}{77709}It doesn't make any difference what|you were doing. I'm gonna call|the constable this time...
{77711}{77789}- and see that you keep off my property.|- Lemme go!|- That's all there is to it, you hear me?
{77791}{77852}Stop it!|Stop it, you mean old man.
{77854}{77920}- You let him go immediately!|- Oh!
{77922}{77982}You came back, did you?|Who are you?
{77984}{78037}My Aunt Polly will send|for the police.
{78039}{78130}And they'll find us|in your old rat-filled basement|and you'll go to jail.
{78132}{78189}Oh. Oh, they know about me, do they?
{78191}{78303}Everything!|All about the children you've kidnapped|and turned into your slaves.
{78305}{78401}- Serves 'em right for|trespassing on my property.|- We weren't hurting anything.
{78403}{78491}We just wanna climb your old tree.
{78493}{78557}You fall out of that tree and get hurt|and I get sued by your parents.
{78559}{78673}I don't got any parents.|I'm an orphan.
{78675}{78760}Well, before I pitch you|into the basement with the others...
{78762}{78832}- what name do you go by, boy?|-Jimmy Bean.
{78834}{78923}Jimmy Bean. I like to keep a record|of your names, you see,Jimmy...
{78925}{78986}so that I can tell you from|the rats down there in the basement.
{78988}{79032}- You lemme go!|- Hey! Come back here, doggone you!
{79034}{79101}Oh, no you don't. No, you don't.|You come back here.
{79132}{79215}What am I going|to do with you, huh?
{79217}{79317}I don't know, sir.
{79319}{79405}Well, it was getting too crowded|with kids in that basement anyway.
{79407}{79470}All right.|I'll let you go this time...
{79472}{79539}but you've got to promise|never to come bothering me here again.
{79541}{79583}- You promise?|- Yes, sir.
{79585}{79652}Cross your heart and hope to die?
{79654}{79724}All right. Get out.|Get out!
{79775}{79838}Go on. What are you waiting for?
{79906}{79965}- You know what I think?|- No.
{79967}{80032}What do you think?
{80034}{80129}I don't think there's any|kids in your old basement.
{80131}{80213}- I think you're just a big bluff!|- Oh, you do, do you?
{80215}{80274}Well, put that down!|What are you doing touching things?
{80276}{80363}Don't touch anything. These are|my things and I don't want them touched.
{80365}{80470}It just looks like a lotta|old dusty junk to me.
{80472}{80541}Well, you wouldn't know anything|about that anyway.
{80543}{80593}You're nothing but a child.
{80595}{80664}Imagine criticizing|a beautiful antique of this kind.
{80797}{80904}- Never heard of such a thing.|- How'd you do that?|- What? What?|What are you talking about?
{80906}{80997}That.|How do you make it?
{81047}{81117}Don't you know anything?|I didn't make it. The sun made it.
{81119}{81213}- That's prismatic reflected light.|- Where from?
{81215}{81291}Where from? Well, uh--
{81310}{81358}Oh, from here.
{81433}{81498}- You see these hanging crystals?|- Mm-hmm.
{81500}{81587}The sun's rays hit it, and it acts|like a prism. You understand?
{81589}{81658}- Sure I understand.|- You do not.
{81660}{81731}You don't know what|a prism is. Now, admit it.
{81733}{81834}It makes a rainbow right on your wall.|Isn't it beautiful?
{81836}{81938}Yes, but when the sun sets,|it'll be gone. So stop carrying on so.
{81940}{82052}Sure, but it'll be back again|tomorrow when the sun comes again.
{82054}{82149}- You have to admit that.|- I don't have to admit anything!
{82201}{82280}Well, I better be|going back home now.
{82361}{82428}Well, goodbye, Mr Pendergast.|It was very nice meeting you.
{82430}{82475}And thank you|for showing me your house.
{82477}{82570}But I didn't show you my house.|You came barging in here!
{82572}{82608}Goodbye.
{82714}{82780}Kids. Kids today.
{82931}{82999}Well, you always were|unpredictable, Edmond.
{83001}{83104}- Hello, Polly.|- Coming here like this|without even calling.
{83106}{83146}Uh, won't you sit down?
{83148}{83212}- Could I get you some sherry?|- Uh, no, thank you.
{83214}{83267}I ran into your niece|down at Wompus Creek.
{83269}{83360}We were talking about you and I thought,|why not stop by and say hello.
{83362}{83442}Why, that's very nice. I don't know why|Pollyanna would be at Wompus Creek.
{83444}{83490}Oh, she was playing.
{83492}{83546}She told me|you'd be alone today.
{83548}{83612}There were so many people|around the other day,|we hardly had a chance to talk.
{83614}{83702}Yes, well, I'm sorry that meeting|got out of hand like that.
{83704}{83790}Well, tell me, who have you seen|since you've been back?|- No one.
{83792}{83859}- You knew that Carleen Donnelly|got married, didn't you?|- No.
{83861}{83912}- You remember her brother,|Beckett Donnelly?|- No.
{83914}{83984}Of course you do.|You two used to argue all the time.
{83986}{84072}Well, I'm sorry, I don't.
{84074}{84162}Well, it really|wasn't that important.
{84164}{84229}I know what I'll do.|I'll give you a welcoming home party.
{84231}{84289}It might be nice to see|some of the old faces again.
{84291}{84345}I know that Gary and Nell|would love to see you.
{84347}{84430}Do you know that Nell|has eight children?|And I think it's the fifth one--
{84432}{84482}- Polly?|- What?
{84546}{84641}I'm not very good at parties.|Please don't.
{84643}{84744}Well, I just thought you might like|to see some of your friends.
{84746}{84807}I came back to see you.
{84858}{84915}Well, that's very flattering.
{84917}{84976}A busy person like you|remembering me.
{84978}{85053}I came back to see if you were married|and what had happened to you.
{85094}{85159}Oh, I'm just the same.
{85161}{85257}- Nothing has changed. Everything is--|- We made a mistake.
{85259}{85358}I came back to see|if you felt the same as I do.
{85360}{85425}Oh, but it's been five years.
{85427}{85504}- You can't just pop out--|- They were wasted years.
{85581}{85638}Tell me about your work, Edmond.
{85640}{85695}We've heard that you've opened|a clinic in Baltimore...
{85697}{85761}and we're very proud of you.
{85813}{85908}- What was it you mentioned|yesterday about the orphanage?|- I don't remember.
{85910}{86017}Oh, yes, you do.|It was something about the dispensary.
{86019}{86089}It's inadequate for that number|of children. That's all.
{86091}{86156}Well, I want to modernize it.|Will you help us?
{86158}{86209}Just tell us what we need|and I'll buy it.
{86211}{86287}It's a civic responsibility.|Why should you buy it?
{86289}{86389}- Well, it isn't as if|I couldn't afford it.|- What does that have to do with it?
{86391}{86468}Well, it's because I want to.|I feel I should.
{86470}{86544}After all, there is an obligation|to having wealth.
{86546}{86665}Haven't you learned yet|that people don't like false charity?
{86667}{86754}Well, I don't want to talk|about it any more. I don't know how|we got off on this subject.
{86756}{86822}Well, it isn't the way I wanted it.
{86866}{86948}- Perhaps I should come again|another time.|- Yes, perhaps you should.
{86950}{87033}And maybe you should call first?
{87035}{87084}Yes, I'll do that.
{87268}{87326}Pollyanna, look at your new dress.
{87328}{87381}It's filthy! And your shoes!
{87412}{87460}Oh, I'm sorry, Aunt Polly.
{87462}{87522}I was playing, and I didn't realise.
{87620}{87696}What were you|and Dr Chilton talking about?
{87720}{87789}Oh! Nothing.
{87791}{87851}We were talking about your hair.
{87853}{87920}- My hair?|- Yes.
{87922}{88016}He said you used to wear it very|long and soft, down to your shoulders.
{88018}{88102}He said it was beautiful!
{88104}{88193}Yes, well, uh--|Clean yourself up for supper, dear.
{88195}{88244}Yes, Aunt Polly.
{88871}{88949}Here is the last|of the calf's-foot jelly.
{88951}{89029}- Oh, but Aunt Polly, please--|- There'll be no nonsense|about it, Pollyanna.
{89031}{89095}This is a duty and a job|that must be done.
{89097}{89165}Nancy will show you where|the deliveries are supposed to be made.
{89167}{89231}- What kind of deliveries?|- Charity baskets, child.
{89233}{89299}- Oh, the suffering in this world!|- Dwell on it.
{89301}{89372}Appreciate how lucky you are.
{89374}{89471}Now, these two go first, Nancy,|and handle them with care.
{89473}{89532}- Where's the one for Mrs Snow?|- Oh.
{89534}{89622}- We took great pains to wrap that|attractively, knowing how she is.|- Yes, ma'am.
{89624}{89703}And there'll be no dawdling. And keep|your clothes clean for a change.
{89705}{89774}Come on. Off with you.
{89776}{89885}- Come on, honey.|We've got three more to go!|- Oh, just a minute, Nancy.
{89887}{89927}What's in the durn thing?
{89929}{90022}Um, I think that one's|calfs'-foot jelly.
{90024}{90087}Oh, you don't have to look at it|as though it was charity...
{90089}{90160}just a gift from|one friend to another.
{90162}{90240}- Friend?|- Yes. I'm your friend.
{90242}{90308}Well, uh, I better be going now.|Goodbye.
{90418}{90489}- People sure hate to get charity.|- Isn't it the truth?
{90491}{90576}- And I don't blame them.|- Do-gooders! Ha!
{90624}{90704}- Goodbye, Miss Ferd.|- Goodbye.
{90706}{90775}- Now, how does that go again?|- Uh--
{90777}{90871}{Y:i}Early one morning|just as the sun was rising
{90873}{90979}{Y:i}Early one morning|just as the sun was rising
{90981}{91079}{Y:i}I heard a maiden singing|in the valley below
{91081}{91117}One up.
{91119}{91224}{Y:i}- Early one morning|-Just as the sun was rising
{91226}{91280}{Y:i}I heard a maiden singing
{91352}{91441}That takes care of|Mrs Gaupherson, Miss Neely...
{91443}{91501}Doppsils and the Ferds.
{91503}{91565}- Who's left?|-Just this one, Mrs Snow.
{91567}{91660}- And I wish this one were over with.|- What's wrong with her?
{91662}{91729}She's just plain crabby,|that's what's wrong with her.
{91731}{91787}You never met anyone|so cantankerous.
{91789}{91855}If it was Friday,|she'd wish it was Tuesday.
{91989}{92088}- What'd we bring her today?|- Uh, calfs'-foot jelly.
{92090}{92168}You wait and see.|She's bound to wish she had chicken.
{92170}{92227}And if we brought her chicken,|she'd want lamb broth.
{92229}{92287}She's just cantankerous!
{92374}{92448}Millie?
{92450}{92500}Nancy, come on in.
{92502}{92539}- How are you?|- Hello, there.
{92541}{92602}- Hello.|- Uh, this is Pollyanna Whittier.
{92604}{92666}Oh, sure. I heard you were coming|to stay with your aunt.
{92668}{92730}- And this is Mrs Snow's|daughter, Mildred.|- How do you do?
{92732}{92794}- How do you do?|- Where were you last night?|We waited and waited.
{92796}{92872}At the hayride. I know. My mother said|I could go and at the last minute|changed her mind.
{92874}{92929}- She had some kind of,|I don't know, an upset stomach.|- Oh, what a shame.
{92931}{93053}Stop that noise in there! Haven't you|any respect for a dying woman?
{93055}{93192}Honestly! She was so crotchety|today. I'm just worn to a frazzle!
{93194}{93247}This morning I-I fixed her|a cup of coffee, as usual.
{93249}{93296}You know, I brought it in.|She didn't want coffee this morning.
{93298}{93370}- This morning she wanted tea.|- I don't know how you stand it.|I swear!
{93372}{93431}I don't know either.|I poured it down the sink.|I had to make her a new cup of tea.
{93433}{93492}Do you remember the day that-that-that|I brought the currant jelly?
{93494}{93556}-Yes!|-I had currant jelly from here to there.
{93558}{93616}She threw it at you!
{93729}{93764}Hello.
{93766}{93804}Who are you?
{93806}{93901}And what are you doing|in my bedroom?
{93903}{93985}- Uh, I am Pollyanna Whittier.|- Who?
{93987}{94051}- Miss Harrington's niece.|- Oh!
{94053}{94130}- The ladies' aid has sent me with this.|- Hmm? What is it?
{94132}{94258}- Calfs'-foot jelly.|- Calfs'-foot jelly! Oh!
{94260}{94357}And I had my heart set|on lamb's broth today.
{94359}{94453}- You mean chicken, don't you?|- What's that?
{94455}{94565}Well, they tell me you always wanted|chicken when you were brought jelly.
{94567}{94661}You're a Miss Impertinence,|aren't ya?
{94663}{94767}Come here.|Come right over here.
{94833}{94895}You have a stubby little nose.
{94897}{94947}What do you think about that?
{94949}{95022}I know it.|I wish I were pretty like you.
{95024}{95096}Oh, don't you try to butter me up.
{95098}{95191}- I'm not at all pretty.|- Oh, but you are!
{95193}{95249}And you don't look sick at all.
{95251}{95343}Well, that shows you|what a stupid little girl you are.
{95345}{95414}Well, get outta my way.
{95416}{95485}Why, I'm right on death's doorstep...
{95487}{95592}just hanging on by sheer will power.
{95594}{95692}If you had to lay here day after day|and day after day, and you call|anybody, and your daughter--
{95694}{95767}Put that down, stop it.|And she wouldn't come.
{95769}{95851}She's gallivantin' somewhere. And the|doctor, all he gives you is pills.
{95853}{95926}Pills and bills.|Just pills and bills. That's all.
{95983}{96049}- What are you staring at?|- Your prisms.
{96051}{96130}- My what?|- Your prisms.
{96132}{96231}- Did you know they paint|rainbows on your wall?|- Oh.
{96233}{96304}See? On that wall over there.
{96546}{96595}How'd you do that?
{96597}{96694}- Well,I said that I'm too old and too|smart for that old saw, Fred Pallegrew.|- Well, I should say so!
{96696}{96790}You just turn that horse around|and head out from underneath|this covered bridge right now.
{96792}{96904}- I'll bet that cooled his heels.|- You should've seen his face.
{96906}{96954}- More coffee?|- Oh, please.
{97040}{97143}- It's awful quiet in there.|- I wonder what's going on.
{97224}{97304}Uh, more to your left.|To your left, you silly girl.
{97306}{97438}What's the matter with you? Now, there.|There. That's not bad at all.
{97440}{97524}Not bad?|It's gorgeous!
{97526}{97596}- I think it was a fine idea.|- Now, don't be taking credit.
{97598}{97676}I suggested stringing them up there.
{97678}{97789}Why, Mrs Snow, that's a fib.|It was my idea.
{97791}{97850}It was my idea to use the string!
{97852}{97920}You didn't know how to do it|till I suggested the string.
{97922}{98035}You're impertinent.|I don't like you at all.
{98037}{98116}I'm sorry.
{98118}{98168}When are you coming back again?
{98170}{98218}Tomorrow, I guess. I'll see you then.
{98220}{98302}Well, if I'm not in my grave.
{98304}{98393}- Bye.|- Bye.
{98395}{98450}All right, Nancy?
{98452}{98537}- Goodbye, Millie.|- Goodbye, Nancy.
{98539}{98606}- Goodbye, Pollyanna!|- Bye.
{98608}{98714}Don't stand there! Go on and fix|a cold pack for my headache!
{98716}{98787}Go on! Go on!
{98789}{98822}Yes, Mother.
{99250}{99296}Let's get some gumption around here.
{99298}{99368}Let's start acting|like a community.
{99405}{99469}Hey, Doc, you just sit there|chewing on that straw.
{99471}{99528}Put in your two bits' worth.|What do you think?
{99530}{99653}I came here to fish, Charlie. I don't|want to butt into your affairs here.
{99655}{99729}Ben Tarbell?|Where are you sneaking off to?
{99778}{99849}You folks are biting off|a pretty big chew with all this talk.
{99851}{99893}Come on, Ben. Get it said.
{99895}{99977}A lot of us have got vested interests|in the Harrington companies.
{99979}{100057}Our wives belong to|her ladies' aid group.
{100059}{100131}My woman would skin me alive if I was|to go opposite to Polly Harrington.
{100133}{100237}And that's the truth!|I'm sorry.
{100239}{100326}Anybody else want to quit,|do it now.
{100328}{100397}All right, then. Let's get our hands|out of our hip pockets...
{100399}{100447}and find a way to raise some money.
{100449}{100525}- Are you with me?|- Yeah.
{100627}{100709}{Y:i}Early one morning|just as the sun was rising
{100711}{100839}{Y:i}I heard a maiden singing|in the valley below
{100841}{100879}What's happening?
{100881}{100941}Now, that's the very first thing|in the morning. Charlie Gorman...
{100943}{100995}that means eight men|assigned to you for carpentry.
{100997}{101065}- Dan Seymour'll supply|the one-by-twelves. Right, Dan?|- Right.
{101067}{101125}All right. Now, look, Mary,|you gotta get that cooking done.
{101127}{101219}- Of course, you got|that other thing to run.|- Yes, Karl,|I'll take care of the chicken.
{101221}{101294}- Hi, Pollyanna!|- Hi. I'll be back in a minute.
{101296}{101356}- Hi, honey.|- Hi. What's going on?
{101358}{101437}Lady, you are looking at the elected|head of the entertainment committee.
{101439}{101490}Old Uncle George!
{101492}{101546}- Entertainment committee for what?|- Well--
{101548}{101608}If we get the corn, you can take|that whole thing out of there.
{101610}{101697}Charlie, you can count on me|to haul in that lumber.
{101699}{101804}- Don't have to use the big truck--|- We're gonna have the best bazaar|you've ever seen.
{101806}{101861}We sure are!
{101863}{101931}- A bazaar?|- To raise money for a new orphanage.
{101933}{102000}It's the first time folks have|stood together against Polly Harrington.
{102002}{102067}- Nancy, did you know|there's going to be a bazaar?|- Yes!
{102069}{102130}With corn on the cob|and ice cream and everything!
{102132}{102219}- Can kids come, George? Can they come?|- Well, of course they--
{102221}{102353}-George?|Now, where'd you get that name?|-Oh, stop. She's known it all along.
{102355}{102414}And you mean|you didn't tell your aunt?
{102416}{102496}- Well, what did you think|I was, a snitch-baby?|- You're a good girl.
{102498}{102556}- When's it gonna be?|- Sunday night, a week.
{102558}{102625}Let me tell you about it.|What a night. An extravaganza.
{102627}{102687}And I'm in charge of all the acts,|all the entertainment.
{102689}{102785}Picture it, ladies.|Darkness, and out of the night...
{102787}{102893}50 bicycles appear,|moving down the square.
{102895}{102954}And hanging from their handlebars...
{102956}{103081}200-- 200 gorgeous Japanese lanterns.
{103598}{103671}Hey, Pollyanna, wait for me.
{103673}{103764}- Where are you goin'?|- There's a big bazaar and I'm helping.
{103766}{103831}Hey, wait a minute.
{103833}{103932}- What's it for?|- It's an extravaganza.
{103934}{103974}Picture it.
{103976}{104022}Darkness...
{104024}{104075}fifty bicycles...
{104077}{104198}200 gorgeous|Japanese lanterns swinging.
{104200}{104305}And I'll be on the lead bicycle,|just riding along, right out in front.
{104307}{104409}- Oh, boy. Can I help?|- All right. Come on.
{104411}{104482}- Where you goin' now?|- Mr Pendergast's.
{104484}{104573}You're going back?|You're nutty!
{105219}{105313}- What are you doing back here?|- Oh, just came to say hello.
{105315}{105426}- Tell you something about your prisms.|- Well, what about them?
{105428}{105513}-Well, aren't you going to invite me in?|-Invite you in?
{105515}{105580}No more privacy than a goldfish.
{105582}{105648}All right. Come in, come in.|But you can't stay long.
{105650}{105711}Can he come in too?
{105713}{105807}- Can who come in?|-Jimmy Bean!
{105809}{105893}Come on.|Don't be a scare-baby!
{105986}{106047}Oh, come on!
{106199}{106249}Don't touch anything.
{106251}{106352}Well, why didn't you just invite|the whole town while you were at it?
{106354}{106440}Oh, I just wanted to show Jimmy|the rainbow on your wall.
{106442}{106505}Do you mind?
{106507}{106563}All right.|Go ahead, go ahead.
{106565}{106622}Kids--|They'll drive you crazy.
{106624}{106689}One thing or another.|It's getting so a man...
{106691}{106755}can't call his home his own any more.
{106798}{106892}And where do you think it comes from?|Through this piece of glass.
{106894}{106989}- Explain it to him, Mr Pendergast.|- I've got work to do.
{106991}{107100}- Don't you know anything about|refracted light, there, boy?|- It's the sunlight coming through--
{107102}{107191}I'll do the explaining if you don't|mind, little Miss Know-it-all.
{107193}{107271}Now, boy, you see here, the--
{107273}{107364}- Don't they ever cut your hair|in that darn orphanage?|- I like it the way it is.
{107366}{107443}Look at you. So much hair, you look|like you're wearing a coonskin cap.
{107445}{107515}- Lemme go, will ya?|- Anyway...
{107517}{107569}about the refracted light.
{107571}{107627}Oh yes.
{107629}{107680}Now pay attention, boy.
{107682}{107776}You see the shape of this crystal?|That is a prism.
{107778}{107850}The light is stripped by that angle.|That refracts the ray...
{107852}{107910}splits the colours,|diffuses them in an oblique angle...
{107912}{107964}and bends it out|into a dispersed colour band.
{107966}{108014}You understand?
{108074}{108115}What he means is...
{108117}{108194}the sun comes through here|and paints a rainbow.
{108196}{108284}- You see?|- Oh, I understand!
{108286}{108343}Can I try it once, please?
{108345}{108415}Go ahead, but don't break anything.
{108517}{108616}Do you know Mrs Snow?|Well, I've just come from her place.
{108618}{108689}And we strung a whole bunch of them|up across her window.
{108691}{108735}You should see what that does!
{108737}{108803}- Let's try it.|- All right.
{108805}{108874}Oh no, I've got work to do.
{108876}{108946}If we had some wire|or a piece of thread...
{108948}{109004}we could string 'em up|across the whole window.
{109006}{109067}Oh, we could, could we?|Do you kids think...
{109069}{109146}I've got nothing better to do|than to play silly games?
{109329}{109381}Well, don't stand there|looking at me like that.
{109383}{109483}There's string in that box over there.|Go and get it, go and get it.
{109485}{109514}Oh, dear, dear, dear.
{109739}{109864}Oh, my goodness! Look!
{109866}{109943}- Look. See over here?|- Look on the door!
{109945}{110036}- It's on the door. Can't you see?|- Look!
{110038}{110086}Oh, it's gorgeous!
{110088}{110191}It's the most beautiful|room in the entire world.
{110193}{110242}Not bad, is it?
{110244}{110292}It's not bad at all.
{110342}{110428}That dining room looks awfully gloomy.|Why don't we do the same thing in there?
{110430}{110486}- Oh, boy! Let's go!|- No.
{110488}{110542}What do you mean, "no"?|I thought you enjoyed it.
{110544}{110610}Well, it's what I came to see you|about, Mr Pendergast.
{110612}{110667}You see, they're having|a big bazaar in town...
{110669}{110744}and they're trying to raise enough money|to build a new orphanage.
{110746}{110799}- I like the old one.|- Be still.
{110801}{110852}Anyway, they need help.
{110854}{110990}And everyone's supposed to bring|somebody else. And I want to bring you.
{110992}{111088}- What for?|- They're having all kinds of stands|to sell things--
{111090}{111188}hooked rugs, quilts|and crocheted tablecloths.
{111190}{111260}And we can have a stand and sell these!
{111262}{111319}Rainbow makers!
{111321}{111378}I'll bet everyone would buy one.
{111380}{111470}I never go into town, and I don't|believe in community projects.
{111472}{111536}- But they need you!|- They need me?
{111676}{111787}Of course, they are sort of|attractive little things, aren't they?
{111789}{111878}I just wonder if folks|would buy a thing like this.
{111880}{111927}I wonder.
{111981}{112082}Now, I'm not trying to sell you|the brass, but it is durable.
{112084}{112152}Well, the silver's pretty, and I think|you're right about the brass.
{112154}{112216}Oh, I don't know.|I just can't make up my mind.
{112218}{112314}Of course, the effect of silver|is always in good taste.
{112316}{112401}- Hi, Mrs Snow.|- Well, where have you been,|you naughty girl?
{112403}{112494}- Oh, I'm sorry. I've been helping|for the bazaar. Hello, Mr Murg.|- How do you do?
{112496}{112608}What've you got there? Don't bring those|dirty rags in here! Get them off my bed!
{112610}{112739}Oh, they aren't dirty rags.|They're patchwork squares.|Mrs Gaupherson made them.
{112741}{112809}I thought perhaps you'd like to|stitch them together...
{112811}{112863}to make a patchwork quilt|for the bazaar.
{112865}{112950}- What an impertinent child!|- Listen. You just take them|right out of here!
{112952}{113034}- I'm not gonna do anything of the sort!|- But everyone's helping--
{113036}{113118}Mr Neely, the Julians,|and even old Mrs Thurm.
{113120}{113221}Oh. She wants me to work|in my condition.
{113223}{113290}Don't bother Mrs Snow, girl.
{113292}{113356}She's a very sick woman!
{113358}{113478}Well, I thought it might give you|something to do instead of|just lying around.
{113480}{113554}I mean, the bazaar's|for an awfully good cause.
{113556}{113645}Well, it's a waste of time.|Nobody'll come to it. You wait and see.
{113647}{113704}- That's right.|- Why not?
{113706}{113831}Because-- Because of your aunt,|that's why not.
{113833}{113878}Well, I don't understand.
{113880}{113949}Well, we do, don't we, Mr Murg?
{113951}{114008}- Indeed we do.|- Good. Well.
{114010}{114108}Now, about this white satin.|I think it's lovely.
{114110}{114188}- This-This is my first choice.|- And I think the best one.
{114190}{114265}- Yeah.|- It'll look lovely|against the brass handles.
{114267}{114329}Are you having a dress made?
{114386}{114463}Don't be impertinent!
{114465}{114535}I'm pickin' the lining for my coffin.
{114537}{114593}That's right.
{114595}{114670}But you're not gonna die!
{114672}{114726}Does she have to be here?
{114728}{114845}Go on into the kitchen|and talk to Mildred.
{114847}{114893}Now--
{114895}{114952}Now, this satin is lovely.
{114954}{115011}Well, it's all settled then.
{115084}{115153}Thirteen yards of the white satin...
{115155}{115216}at $ 1 .20 the yard.
{115265}{115352}And the brass coffin handles.
{115354}{115454}Well, all right, all right.|Write it up.
{115456}{115516}Stop frowning at me like that!
{115518}{115577}What's the matter with you?
{115579}{115655}Well, it's just that...
{115657}{115746}well, a person shouldn't think|about dying so much!
{115748}{115853}- I don't want you to die.|- Oh, bless you for that.
{115855}{115907}It seems everyone else can't wait.
{115983}{116047}I'm not supposed to talk|about my father at home...
{116049}{116097}but I guess it's all right here.
{116099}{116205}My father used to say,|a person should think about living.
{116207}{116290}Why don't you go outside and play?
{116292}{116409}- Hush up.|I want to hear what she has to say.|- Yes. Mrs Snow. Yes.
{116411}{116483}It just reminded me|about my father and the doll.
{116485}{116543}You see,|I always wanted a doll...
{116545}{116654}but we never had enough money|for things like that.|My father was a minister.
{116656}{116747}But surely he could afford|a little thing like a doll.
{116749}{116818}Well, he couldn't.|We had to have the money for food.
{116820}{116899}- Oh, for heaven's sake!|- Shh!
{116901}{116982}So anyway, my father wrote|to the missionary people...
{116984}{117076}and asked them to please send|a little secondhand doll.
{117078}{117168}Well, there was a funny mistake.|When the missionary barrels came...
{117170}{117268}instead of a doll,|they sent a pair of crutches.
{117270}{117330}Well, of course,|I was rather disappointed.
{117332}{117425}- So my father made up the glad game.|- The what game?
{117427}{117532}She's been pestering folks all over town|with this sunshine and happiness thing.
{117534}{117625}Hearts and flowers.|Enough to make you sick.
{117627}{117720}- Hush up! I want to hear it.|- Certainly.
{117772}{117826}Anyway, about the crutches...
{117828}{117887}my father said,|"Don't let's be gloomy.
{117889}{117953}Let's try to find something|to be glad about."
{117955}{118021}So we made a game of it--|the glad game!
{118023}{118105}- "The glad game"!|- Shh!
{118107}{118171}So anyway, we played the game...
{118173}{118265}and after a while I forgot|about the doll and being gloomy.
{118267}{118349}And you know what?|I found a reason for being glad.
{118351}{118443}Well, there's nothing happy|about a pair of crutches.
{118445}{118536}Well, we were glad|that we didn't have to use them!
{118538}{118610}Why must you bedevil|this poor dying woman...
{118612}{118663}with your childish,|silly little stories?
{118665}{118783}I just thought she could play the game!|You could be glad you don't need|this horrid old coffin!
{118785}{118910}You could help others|by making the patchwork quilt|for the orphans if you wanted.
{118912}{119001}You ought to forget about dying|and be glad you're living!
{119087}{119148}Oh, I don't care what you do.
{119252}{119340}I'm not gonna come|and see you any more.
{119367}{119462}I-- I didn't mean|to hurt her feelings.
{119513}{119606}- She's serious about it, isn't she?|- Oh, please, please, Mr Murg.
{119608}{119656}Leave me alone.
{119658}{119751}- I'm sorry if I've--|- Please.
{119753}{119821}Please leave me alone.
{121085}{121185}Ben told me yesterday they've been|organizing, about 50 of them.
{121187}{121253}- And Ed Chilton's got a finger|in the pie too!|- Edmond?
{121255}{121317}Gave them the idea is what he did.|And that's not all.
{121319}{121449}- It couldn't have been Nancy.|- I tell you, she was there.|Jesse told me.
{121451}{121546}I'd fire that girl so fast,|it would make her head swim.
{121548}{121682}And that child, your own niece,|helping them!
{121684}{121738}Pollyanna?
{121740}{121803}Just a moment.
{121805}{121883}Mrs Tarbell tells me you're involved|with that bazaar. Well, I won't have it.
{121885}{121957}But, Aunt Polly,|I'm part of the flag.
{121959}{122031}We won't discuss it. I don't want you|to see those people any more...
{122033}{122108}and that's an order!
{122110}{122159}Yes, ma'am.
{122236}{122360}The blessings you've heaped|on that child, and her working|with those people against you.
{122394}{122465}Get down my cake tins, Angie.|We're going to work.
{122467}{122560}- Doin' what?|- Thinks she's the queen of Sheba,|does she?
{122562}{122629}Well, she can't stop us|from helping with that bazaar!
{122631}{122704}We're gonna bake cakes,|dozens and dozens of'em!
{122706}{122788}- Where are you gonna get|the ingredients?|- Where do you think?
{122937}{123035}- You're getting paid, aren't you?|- Not to be kicked.|He kicked me in the stomach.
{123037}{123110}Now,Jimmy, you've got to stop|kicking Mr Hooper and sit still.
{123112}{123169}- I don't want to get my hair cut!|- Hey,Jed.
{123171}{123250}Get that hammer out back,|and we'll nail his shoes to the chair!
{123252}{123321}- Hey.|- Mr Pendergast.
{123323}{123381}You should be ashamed of yourself,|Ben Tarbell!
{123383}{123481}I paid for the tickets.|Will you let it go at that, Karl?|I just can't show up at your affair.
{123483}{123581}- You ain't the only one, Ben.|- What do you mean by that?
{123583}{123681}Well, I just came|from your newspaper office.|What's the matter with those fellows?
{123683}{123774}They said they couldn't handle|this ad for our bazaar. Will you|go over and straighten them out?
{123776}{123863}Ah, take it easy, Doc. Our space|is all sold, and I can't go around--
{123865}{123953}Tell him the truth.|Why lie to the man? You're a coward!
{123955}{124035}It isn't Baltimore up here, Doc.|This is a small town.
{124037}{124107}And you know as well as everybody else|our newspaper's owned|by the Harrington family.
{124109}{124169}Liver-bellied bunch of miserable sheep!|That's what you all are.
{124171}{124245}Well, take it easy, Pendergast.|It's the way things are.
{124247}{124308}I say that you're all chicken-livered!|And I'm sick and tired of--
{124310}{124379}Just a minute!Just a minute!|The thing is this.
{124381}{124465}Most folks around here make a living|outta Polly Harrington,|some way or another.
{124467}{124555}- We can't afford to antagonize her.|- Can't afford to antagonize her?
{124557}{124644}Just don't be surprised if come Sunday|night nobody shows up at your bazaar.
{124646}{124749}I don't believe that.
{124751}{124854}Well, you're comin', aren't ya?|Claire? Charlie?
{124904}{124966}People are just plain scared to, Karl.
{124968}{125034}They're afraid of Polly Harrington|paying 'em back later.
{125036}{125111}- She'll do it too. You know her.|- Now, look.
{125113}{125161}We've all taken a cut or two|at the Harringtons...
{125163}{125246}but she wouldn't do a thing like that.
{125311}{125398}- If you think I'm|intimidating a whole town--|- Oh, Polly, you know what I mean.
{125400}{125472}No one will make a move|in this town without the Harrington|stamp of approval on it.
{125474}{125515}Oh!
{125578}{125670}Karl Warren sent you, didn't he? He knew|no one would cooperate without me.
{125672}{125773}Nobody sent me.|I just wanted it made clear|you don't mind if the others cooperate.
{125775}{125846}You needed my help.|Why don't you admit it?
{125848}{125916}Won't let your guard down|for a minute, will you?
{125918}{126005}Still suspicious.|Still don't trust anyone.
{126007}{126072}Nothing's changed, has it, Polly?
{126074}{126160}You're still as opinionated as ever,|if that's what you mean.
{126229}{126282}Oh, Angelica...
{126284}{126339}Dr Chilton is leaving.
{126418}{126523}Keep busy, Polly. Lots of meetings|and civic duties and obligations.
{126525}{126619}It's a poor substitute|for what's really wrong with you.
{126621}{126718}I knew I could count on you|for some lofty clinical observations.
{126720}{126804}Would you like to be paid|for your diagnosis?
{126806}{126932}This one's on the house.|There's no medical term for it.
{126934}{127040}You can give everything but love.|It's as simple as that.
{127298}{127337}- Angelica?|- Ma'am?
{127339}{127398}See that the flowers|in the conservatory get fresh water.
{127400}{127484}- I found them dry again today.|- Yes, ma'am.
{127728}{127776}Did ya hear how he told her off?
{127778}{127840}Like water off a duck's back to her.
{127842}{127908}That woman's got no feelings at all!
{128817}{128920}- How'd it go, Ed?|- Stubborn, mule-headed woman.Just like|her father. I should have known better.
{128922}{128979}- What did she say?|- A lot of foolish nonsense.
{128981}{129044}What she really wants|is for us to go begging to her...
{129046}{129138}get her sanction, permission|from the queen to gather in the streets.
{129140}{129198}- Hi, Nancy.|- Hi, dear.|- What's the matter?
{129200}{129278}- Oh, nothing.|- It's a doggone shame,|after all the work folks put into it.
{129280}{129340}- Is the bazaar off?|- It looks that way.
{129342}{129417}- Why?|- You wouldn't understand.
{129419}{129468}- Is it because of Aunt Polly?|- Yes.
{129470}{129552}It takes a word from someone,|someone who isn't under her thumb.
{129554}{129613}Fat change you got, Ed. She's got|her finger in nearly everything--
{129615}{129671}the bank, the mills,|the paper, real estate.
{129673}{129750}Harrington Town. A fine thing,|one woman owning a town.
{129752}{129800}Well, like it or not,|that's what she does.
{129802}{129868}- Nancy.|- Yes?|- She doesn't own the church.
{129870}{129923}That's right.
{129960}{130043}What did you say?
{130045}{130143}Um, I just said that|nobody could own a church.
{130209}{130308}Our social structure in this small town|seems to teeter on a delicate balance...
{130310}{130398}one which-- which I certainly cannot|in any way attempt to influence.
{130400}{130470}A-A man of God cannot be|taking sides in these feuds.
{130472}{130520}- But all we want|is a word from you, Reverend.|- No.
{130522}{130599}- If you'd just let the people know|tomorrow you're in favour of us.|- No, no, no.
{130601}{130650}I won't use that pulpit|for public announcements.
{130652}{130759}- Then you're siding with her|by not mentioning it.|- I am not!
{130761}{130817}I'm staying completely out of it,|and that's all there is to it.
{130819}{130892}Reverend Ford, if you'd just|let us say that you're in favour.
{130894}{130962}There's nothing more to discuss.
{130964}{131049}- This is all just impossible.|- I'm afraid you're right.
{131210}{131262}Thank you, Reverend Ford.
{131454}{131511}You see, I--|Of course, you understand that--
{131513}{131640}Personally I think it's a good cause and|all that, and-and I wish you luck with it.
{131642}{131748}Thanks a lot.|I guess Pollyanna was wrong.
{131750}{131834}Now, what has she got to do with this?
{131836}{131918}She said nobody|could own a church.
{132215}{132301}- Hello, Mrs Ford.|- Hello, dear. What are you doing here?
{132303}{132376}Aunt Polly sent me.|Uh, something for Reverend Ford.
{132378}{132459}- Oh, he's just back up there.|- Oh, yes, I saw him. Thank you.
{132461}{132538}- It's a lovely day, isn't it?|- Yes, it is.
{132691}{132787}And he sayeth unto them...
{132789}{132855}the wicked shall be punished.
{132917}{133025}The wicked shall be punished.
{133027}{133099}Their poison is like|the poison of serpents.
{133128}{133214}But they shall feel|the gall of asps within them.
{133332}{133392}How many times|have I stood on this pulpit...
{133442}{133541}and warned you,|cautioned you again and again--
{133543}{133638}A house divided against itself|cannot stand.
{133640}{133763}A kingdom divided against itself|can be brought to desolation.
{133765}{133848}If you are an enemy to one another...
{133850}{133921}then you are an enemy to God!
{133994}{134095}Am I reaching out to you?|Do you understand my words?
{134097}{134143}Well--
{134175}{134286}Week after week, I stand here|reaching out to you...
{134288}{134357}begging you to understand.
{134359}{134408}Yet, week after week...
{134410}{134477}the same wickedness persists...
{134479}{134534}the same dissension...
{134536}{134598}the same belligerence,|the same feuding...
{134600}{134666}until you are|ten thousand times...
{134668}{134743}more abominable in|the eyes of God...
{134745}{134861}than the most hateful,|venomous, violent, vicious--
{134939}{134987}You!
{135019}{135110}- What are you doing here?|- Oh, nothing.
{135112}{135171}Um, I mean, I was looking for you.
{135173}{135242}Uh, Aunt Polly sent you this.
{135244}{135305}- Now, what is it?|- Uh, I don't know.
{135339}{135413}I'm sorry I disturbed|your practise.
{135618}{135692}- Would you like someone|to practise your sermon on?|- No. No, thank you, child.
{135762}{135845}Uh, Mother and I used to be|an audience to my father...
{135847}{135900}when he was practising|his sermons.
{135982}{136065}- He-He was a minister too, you know.|- Oh, yes, yes. So he was.
{136119}{136182}Uh, do you like being a minister?
{136290}{136340}Do I like being a m--
{136415}{136479}Now, why would you ask|a thing like that?
{136481}{136603}Oh, the way you looked just then|reminded me of my father.
{136630}{136718}Once I saw him sorta sad like that,|and I asked him.
{136841}{136890}And what did he say?
{136892}{136993}Oh. Oh, said he was glad he was.
{136995}{137057}But it made him sad sometimes.
{137059}{137153}Just couldn't seem to get through|to his congregation.
{137155}{137203}Sounds familiar.
{137205}{137285}I suppose every minister of|God faces the same problem.
{137287}{137360}Mm, I suppose.
{137362}{137471}Tell me, did your father|ever solve the problem?
{137473}{137587}Well, he read something one day|that he said helped him.
{137589}{137637}In the Bible?
{137639}{137710}No, just something|he read someplace.
{137712}{137770}He had it put on this chain.
{137772}{137856}He wore it always.|It's all I have of his.
{137905}{137993}"When you look for the bad--"
{137995}{138078}Ooh! It always makes me cross-eyed.
{138080}{138138}May I?
{138269}{138400}"When you look for the bad in mankind|expecting to find it...
{138402}{138478}you surely will.
{138480}{138588}- Abraham Lincoln."|- He was the president.
{138590}{138643}Yes. Yes, I know.
{138731}{138798}But I never heard that before.
{138800}{138848}Neither had my father.
{138850}{138925}Anyway, he said|it started him thinking.
{138927}{139041}And from then on, he was gonna|look for the good in people.
{139043}{139132}That's when we both started|searching the Bible for the texts.
{139134}{139189}The texts?
{139191}{139333}Yes. You know. My father|called them "the glad passages."
{139335}{139395}You know, the happy ones like...
{139397}{139484}um, uh, "Shout for joy"...
{139486}{139551}or "Be glad in the Lord."
{139553}{139681}You know, like that. There are|800 happy texts. Did you know that?
{139683}{139752}- No, I didn't know that.|- Yes, well, there are.
{139754}{139802}And you know, my father said...
{139804}{139918}"If God took the trouble to tell us|800 times to be glad and rejoice...
{139920}{139970}he must've wanted us to do it."
{140007}{140099}Oh, I'd better be going now.|I'm sorry I disturbed your practising.
{140101}{140182}I'll see you later. Uh, goodbye.
{140475}{140523}Goodbye, Reverend Ford.
{140916}{140964}"Dear Reverend...
{140993}{141063}I've taken the liberty of|jotting down a few thoughts...
{141065}{141117}and some text from Matthew...
{141158}{141238}which I thought you might want|to use in your sermon tom--"
{141663}{141754}Oh, my God. What have I done?
{141756}{141804}What have I done?
{142313}{142366}Dear, are you all right?
{142591}{142663}Nobody owns a church.
{142665}{142713}No one.
{143783}{143881}Apocrypha. Ecclesiasticus 30...
{143912}{143978}paragraph 22.
{144047}{144120}"Gladness of the heart|is the life of man."
{144171}{144262}This is one of the rejoicing...
{144264}{144334}or happy texts.
{144336}{144388}Ayoung member of our parish|pointed out to me...
{144390}{144464}that there are 800 such|happy texts in our Bible.
{144516}{144566}Well, she was wrong.
{144602}{144655}There are, to be exact...
{144766}{144865}I know, because I stayed up most|of last night counting them.
{144961}{145030}I intend to read one|of them every week.
{145032}{145133}And that should take us, according to|my calculations, through 1 6 years...
{145160}{145211}if I'm around here that long.
{145294}{145403}But I can promise you this.|If I am here...
{145405}{145501}our visits with God on Sunday|are going to be happier...
{145503}{145557}and more rejoicing too.
{145607}{145655}Eh.
{145824}{145886}Now, what I have to say now...
{145888}{145943}is very difficult for me.
{145983}{146036}But it must be said.
{146062}{146115}I look out to you now...
{146161}{146220}and realize...
{146222}{146290}after four years|in this congregation...
{146340}{146463}I don't even know you. I look out|to you now not as my congregation...
{146465}{146516}but as people.
{146518}{146608}And I say to myself, how sad it is|to have missed those four years...
{146610}{146704}four years when|we could've been friends.
{146706}{146811}I should have been looking|for the good in you.
{146813}{146901}And I-- I failed you. I--
{146973}{147037}And I apologize for this.
{147113}{147222}God is forgiving, but it's not|God's forgiveness I beg, it is yours.
{147317}{147432}I'm-I'm not gonna speak about this|any more now. It's a lovely day outside.
{147434}{147518}So let's go outside and enjoy|this Sunday for a change.
{147520}{147586}And while you're out|appreciating the sunlight, just...
{147588}{147686}give a little thought|to who's sending it down to you.
{147688}{147744}Eh.
{147874}{147983}Oh, stop, please.|One more thing, please! Please sit down.
{147985}{148094}Please.Just one more thing.|I'm sorry.
{148096}{148178}There's to be a charity bazaar|in the band park tonight.
{148180}{148236}It's for a good cause.
{148238}{148301}And, um, I want to go on record...
{148303}{148374}as being 1 00 percent for it.
{148376}{148433}So let's all go out there|and have ourselves some fun...
{148435}{148495}because, um...
{148497}{148579}well, if you're not there--
{148581}{148652}Let me put it this way.
{148654}{148725}If you're not there...
{148727}{148824}I'll lam into you something fierce|when I get you in here next week!
{148826}{148901}And you know I can do it too!
{149693}{149777}- Where's Pollyanna?|- I don't know. I haven't seen her.
{150163}{150224}Be careful when you put those in the|car. Don't you smudge that frosting.
{150226}{150279}Keep your fingers outta there.
{150394}{150460}Nancy? Angelica?
{150759}{150842}Where's Pollyanna, please?|She's gotta be there.
{150844}{150990}It's a big bazaar tonight. Pollyanna's|gotta be there, or she'll ruin the flag.
{150992}{151054}Well, Pollyanna is too young|to be out alone at night.
{151056}{151186}- Couldn't you bring her?|- No, I could not. Goodnight.
{151336}{151401}Gemmenie! Oh!
{152220}{152268}Pollyanna!
{152446}{152528}What are you doing up here?|You'll fall.
{152530}{152588}You'll fall and kill yourself,|you big silly.
{152590}{152684}You gotta come. You'll spoil|the flag if you don't show up.
{152686}{152791}I can't. Aunt Polly won't let me.
{152793}{152867}Come on. She'll never know.
{153113}{153178}Don't look down.
{153233}{153308}- I don't think I want to try it.|- Come on. Gimme your hand.
{153310}{153358}I'll help you across.
{153450}{153565}Come on. Easy. Easy. Real slow.
{153593}{153678}Grab that one. All right.|Don't look down.
{153680}{153765}- Are you sure it's safe?|- I'm sure it's safe.
{153767}{153823}It's ripe. It's lovely.|There you are, folks.
{153825}{153930}The finest watermelon at a penny|a slice. You cannot have finer.
{153932}{154030}There's your best one.|I say, isn't that good? Yes, it is.
{154032}{154101}- Here you are, lad.|- Thank you very much.
{154103}{154169}- There you are. Isn't that fine?|- It looks wonderful!
{154627}{154679}Hurry, hurry! Hurry, hurry!
{155176}{155264}- Hello, Mr Howard.|- Reverend Ford, Mrs Ford.|Nice to see ya.
{155266}{155326}- We have a booth over here.|- There you are, sir.
{155328}{155387}This beautiful,|soon-to-be patented rainbow maker.
{155389}{155439}You're going to be very happy|with it, sir. Hurry, hurry.
{155441}{155489}Right this way,|ladies and gentlemen.
{155491}{155539}- Well, where in the heck have you been?|- Well, we made--
{155541}{155597}Well, they're looking|for you everywhere.|Go and get into your costume now.
{155599}{155675}Hurry, hurry! Go on! And,Jimmy,|go have some fun for yourself.
{155677}{155775}- This way, ladies and gentlemen.|- Oh, that looks delicious, Mrs Litner.
{155777}{155853}Thank you, Mrs Cleaver.|Just pay on the other side.
{155924}{156010}- There you go, my dear.|- Thank you, Mrs Lagerlof.
{156012}{156067}You're very welcome.
{156069}{156192}Pollyanna! Will you go and get into|your costume? They're waiting for you.
{156194}{156277}Now, who do you suppose this is?
{156279}{156335}- Mrs Snow!|- Here.
{156337}{156421}Here. Now, you can take this|and raffle it off.
{156423}{156508}You finished it. Oh, it's gorgeous.
{156510}{156559}Mrs Snow, it's beautiful.
{156561}{156619}Hi, Millie. Good evening, Mrs Snow.
{156621}{156713}Darling! Listen, honey, you've|gotta hurry. They're waiting for you.
{156715}{156777}- Uhh, quilt?|- Well, I'll take it to the quilt stand.
{156779}{156844}- Now you skedaddle as fast as you can|and put on your costume.|- Here. Hold my cake.
{156846}{156894}Run!
{156896}{157004}A nice, home-made patchwork quilt.|No home is complete without one.
{157006}{157065}On the cob.|There's some salt over there.
{157067}{157129}- Can I have more?|- You finish those first, then you|can come back and have some more.
{157131}{157194}Delicious corn on the cob.
{157196}{157247}- One.|- Right here.
{157249}{157321}Pollyanna, will you hurry up? Everyone|else is dressed and waiting for you.
{157323}{157384}- But I never get a chance|to have anything.|- Oh, come on.
{157386}{157449}Yes, you'll win yourself|a beautiful doll.
{157451}{157521}A beautiful doll if ya fish|in the fishing pond.
{157523}{157573}All right, step right up here, folks.|This is the place.
{157575}{157702}- I am not going to budge.|- I've had just enough of your nonsense.
{157704}{157793}You're going to join in with the others|and make this a town, not a dynasty.
{157795}{157873}Get down out of that car, Amelia.|I'm warning you. Move!

{158293}{158385}- I'm wishing.|- Do you know what you want?
{158387}{158435}All right.

{158761}{158856}It's only two cents.|Drop a line and fish for your surprise.
{158858}{158919}It's the most exciting game|at the bazaar.

{159349}{159403}- Step right up|and show 'em how to do it.|- No, no. No, no.
{159405}{159468}- I haven't pitched|since my college days.|- Hey, Reverend!
{159470}{159523}Bet you couldn't hit|the broad side of a barn.
{159578}{159642}Who is that?|Charley MacAndrews up there?
{159644}{159711}- What about it?|- Here. Hold this.
{159713}{159769}Leave your coat on.|You're not gonna hit anything anyhow.
{159771}{159850}- Buy some corn with the money.|- You know...
{159852}{159935}I've been trying to get you|baptised for the past three years.
{160027}{160079}And he throws!

{162456}{162576}{Y:i}O beautiful for spacious skies
{162578}{162681}{Y:i}For amber waves of grain
{162683}{162793}{Y:i}For purple mountain majesties

{162913}{163028}{Y:i}America, America
{163030}{163143}{Y:i}God shed his grace on thee
{163145}{163270}{Y:i}And crown thy good with brotherhood
{163272}{163379}{Y:i}From sea to shining
{163381}{163464}{Y:i}Sea

{165391}{165481}{Y:i}Wild and wide
{165524}{165579}- Oh! Thank you.|- Goodnight.|- Goodnight.

{166135}{166222}{Y:i}My heart just fades away
{166224}{166292}{Y:i}And dies
{166294}{166378}{Y:i}I'll take you home again
{166380}{166466}{Y:i}Kathleen
{170139}{170216}I'd never thought.|The way they bought up those cakes!
{170218}{170289}It's a lot of money for that.
{170291}{170360}- What is it, ma'am?|- I thought I heard something.
{170561}{170609}Oh, Lord of mercy.
{170701}{170749}Oh!
{170885}{170949}Oh, Angelica,|call the doctor quickly.
{171015}{171066}Oh, my God.
{172230}{172321}If you don't mind, I'd like to speak|to all of you in the salon for a moment.
{172795}{172891}Nancy, when Miss Pollyanna|feels better...
{172893}{172995}I want you to move all of my clothes|and my personal belongings|into the next room.
{172997}{173077}- Yes, ma'am.|- I want her to stay where she is.
{173079}{173163}It's a larger room,|and it has a much nicer view.
{173209}{173322}And it looks as though she's|going to have to remain there|for quite some time.
{173379}{173470}You might as well know that|Pollyanna's legs are paralyzed.
{173576}{173664}She doesn't know it yet, and I don't|know exactly how I'm going to tell her.
{173704}{173790}I just don't know how|I'm going to tell her.
{174085}{174172}I came as soon as I heard.|Eh, how is the child?
{174916}{174969}Pollyanna!
{174971}{175081}Come on down and play! Pollyanna!
{175083}{175132}We'll go swimmin'. Want to?
{175134}{175205}- Pollyanna!|- Boy! Boy! Boy, boy.
{175207}{175273}Stop that, stop that.|Now, you go away from here.
{175275}{175382}- But I wanna play with Pollyanna.|- Pollyanna can't play,|because she's had an accident.
{175384}{175504}Now, you go on home like a good boy.|Go on. Hurry up. Go on.
{175531}{175579}Hurry up. Go on.
{176011}{176093}- God works in ways mysterious to man.|- Don't speak to me about God!
{176095}{176194}Say what you think.|I can see it in your eyes.
{176196}{176281}- They blame me, don't they?|- No. No, nobody's blaming you.
{176283}{176401}It's true, isn't it? I could have|been the least bit understanding.
{176403}{176463}That child lies up there|because of me.
{176518}{176618}- Polly, the mercy of God is forgiving--|- Oh, what kind of a merciful God...
{176620}{176701}could allow a thing like this|to happen to a child?
{176703}{176775}And if he were merciful,|why did he let her come to our town?
{176810}{176876}Let me tell you something,|Polly Harrington.
{176907}{176961}-Sunday a miracle happened in this town.|-Oh, this town!
{176963}{177070}Yes, this town.|Right out there in that street|the people are smiling at one another.
{177072}{177182}Go on. Take a look for yourself.|It's very contagious.
{177184}{177289}Just think, Polly.|If she had never come to this town--
{177419}{177505}We ought to get down on our knees|and thank God for sending her to us.
{177575}{177657}Excuse me, ma'am.|Dr Chilton wants to see you.
{178075}{178138}Now, you understand everything|I told you, don't you, dear?
{178140}{178222}- And there's nothing to be afraid of.|- What is it, Edmond?
{178224}{178345}I told Pollyanna about her injury.|She understands. Don't you, dear?
{178347}{178439}We're going to take you to Baltimore|for an operation so you can walk again.
{178441}{178494}You hear that, honey?
{178658}{178729}I know. Why don't we all cheer up?
{178776}{178902}Let's see if we can't find something|to be glad about your staying in bed.
{178904}{178977}Um, oh, I know.
{178979}{179044}This way we can all|have steak and ice cream.
{179046}{179128}Did you know that your aunt|ordered it for you?
{179130}{179212}Now you find something to be|glad about. We'll play the game.
{179276}{179341}Well--
{179418}{179488}I suppose I could be glad because--
{179490}{179546}Yes? Go ahead, darling.
{179618}{179699}No. It was a silly game.
{179737}{179789}I hate it.
{179791}{179855}I never want to play it again.
{179887}{179949}Leave me alone.
{180131}{180188}Please try to understand,|Pollyanna.
{180219}{180293}You're such a part|of our lives now.
{180295}{180396}Nancy and Angelica, Mrs Lagerlof.
{180439}{180519}And I love you as if|you were my own little girl.
{180565}{180640}Won't you give me that chance?|Please?
{181103}{181170}- Put these in too, Mr Thomas.|- All right.
{181172}{181261}- And tell Dr Chilton|that the car's all ready.|- Yes.
{181263}{181361}Yes, we're leaving immediately|on the 1 1 :30 train.
{181363}{181432}Well, check the arrival schedule.
{181434}{181537}Make sure we're met with an ambulance.|I want complete X rays|the minute we arrive.
{181567}{181620}Yes. Thank you.
{181773}{181871}- Is the operation dangerous?|- Yes, it's very delicate.
{181873}{181953}You're coming, aren't you?|I need your permission to operate.
{182090}{182152}Edmond.
{182154}{182250}There's something worrying you,|and I want to know what it is.
{182252}{182358}We can only do so much with surgery.|A great deal depends on her.
{182360}{182468}This depression she's got herself into.|That's what's worrying me.
{182499}{182616}Edmond. She's had a shock.|She's just learned about her legs.
{182618}{182679}I can't have her despondent|like this for the operation.
{182681}{182751}- Well, you have to give her time.|- Time? There is no time.
{182753}{182830}I have to move her, get her into|the hospital, and I don't like it.
{182832}{182908}What that child needs is|a good shot in the arm of hope.
{182945}{183040}Hope?|What she really needed was love.
{183042}{183113}And that's something|I never gave her.
{183227}{183286}We can still give her that love.
{183288}{183341}You and I together.
{183464}{183554}Ma'am! Ma'am! There's something|very peculiar happening outside.
{183556}{183639}Miss Harrington!|They-They-They'll ruin our flower beds.
{183641}{183723}- What are you talking about?|- A-A-Across the lawns and the flowers.
{183725}{183834}W-We gotta do something. I gotta|stop 'em. Gotta get 'em outta there.
{183836}{183893}- Now, let me out.|- That's what I've been|trying to tell you.
{183895}{183953}Been trying to tell me what?
{184620}{184674}Oh, not the begonias!
{184711}{184782}Them's Miss Harrington's|favourite flowers.
{184784}{184835}Now, please, folks.|Go around the other way.
{184837}{184918}Don't come through there.|You can go around that tree.
{184920}{185017}Now look!|Go around over by the driveway. I--
{185105}{185172}Oh, the heck with it.
{185295}{185361}- What is it you want?|- We don't want anything.
{185363}{185422}We just come to say|"How'd ya do" to the child...
{185424}{185484}and bring a bit of gladness|into her life.
{185486}{185549}Like she brought into ours,|God love her.
{185551}{185618}We just want her to know|she's got friends, lots of them.
{185620}{185725}Give her our love and we'll get off|your private property, Miss Harrington.
{185727}{185795}Well, no. Uh, wait.
{185797}{185888}Why don't you tell her yourself?|Open the doors, Nancy.
{185890}{185938}Nancy, open the door.
{185969}{186017}Come in, won't you?|Nice to see you.
{186019}{186097}Hello. How are you, Mr Neely?|I'm just fine. How are you today?
{186125}{186197}Hello. Won't you come in?|Oh, what beautiful flowers.
{186199}{186304}Hello. I'm so glad you came. Hello.
{186417}{186492}You have a few callers downstairs,|young lady.
{186494}{186595}- What?|- You gonna greet them with|that mopey old face of yours?
{186597}{186653}I don't wanna see anyone.
{186655}{186749}Well, Pollyanna, you're not gonna have|much choice in the matter this time.
{186837}{186914}- Oh, no, please.|I don't wanna see anyone.|- Now, just easy.
{187643}{187749}- You'll be all right, dear. I know.|- You get well now, you hear?
{187751}{187849}It's not charity.Just a gift,|eh, from one friend to another.
{187851}{187919}- Oh, thank you, Mr Neely.|- Hi, honey.
{187921}{187983}You're going to be fine.|Don't you worry.
{187985}{188058}Goodbye, darling. We're going|to visit you in the hospital.
{188060}{188147}Hey, Snookie.|Take a look at this, will ya?
{188149}{188244}Really? You mean, really?|You did it!
{188284}{188406}- Oh, Nancy. It's gorgeous.|- Isn't it?
{188408}{188508}And we're gonna wait for you.|You're gonna be my flower girl.
{188613}{188674}I'm glad you'll be comin'|back to us, darlin'.
{188676}{188729}And that's the truth of it.
{188770}{188829}The house will be|miserable without you.
{188831}{188930}Miserable. You hurry back to us.
{188995}{189043}Best wishes, Pollyanna.
{189204}{189252}Goodbye.
{189291}{189345}Goodbye, Angelica.
{189499}{189547}Hurry home to us.
{189611}{189685}What is everybody sniffin' about?|My goodness.
{189687}{189771}A bunch of ninnies.|Think a person couldn't get well.
{189773}{189891}- Hi, Mrs Snow.|- Oh, bless you. Bless you, darling.

Be careful.
Crete.
Excuse me.
He says, "Big storm. Ship must wait."
- How long?
- I don't know.
You're traveling.
Where to, with your permission?
Crete.
And you stay there long, no?
How do you know?
I watch you with all the boxes in the rain. Very funny.
I like you.
Take me with you. Will you?
Take...?
- Why?
- Why?
Will no man ever do something without a "why?" Just like that. For the hell of it.
All right, take me as a cook.
I make soups like...
You like soups, no?
- Well...
- Of course you do. You're English, no?
- Half.
- Half?
My father was Greek, but I was born in England.
Same thing.
With your permission.
Hey...
"Virginia."
- No. No, thank you.
- Please.
Keep the packet.
Only one.
Are you a cook?
If you need one, I am.
What I meant was, what work do you do?
Listen to him. I got hands, feet, head. They do the jobs.
Who the hell am I to choose?
Well then, what was the most recent?
In a mine. I am a good miner.
I have a clever nose for the metals.
But I beat up the boss, and they kicked me out.
I'm getting awfully nervous about the boat. I think I'll...
If you like, I go ask.
No, thank you. It's... It's all right.
Well, maybe we could go together and then you could ask for me.
- Sure. Give me.
- No. Thank you, I can manage.
He says 10:00.
Well, that's three whole hours. Damn.
- Are you in big hurry?
- No.
Then it's all right. Come.
Roumi.  That's "rum."
- I'll have some tea, if you don't mind.
- Tea?
And you, mister, what do you do?
Me? Well, I'm a writer.
Excuse me, but you look it.
What do you write? Love stories?
No. Poetry. Essays.
What's that?
Essays.
No. You think too much.
That is your trouble.
Clever people and grocers, they weigh everything.
Me? If I was you, I would look at me straight and I would say:
"Zorba, come." Or, "Zorba, don't come."
Zorba?
That's me: Alexis Zorba.
- I have other names, if you are interested.
- Oh, I am.
"Spaghetti," because I am long.
And "California," because I have been to America.
And "Epidemic," because every place
I go, people say I louse things up.
Your health.
Listen to that bitch, the sea.
That maker of widows.
What have you got in there?
Clothes?
You ask such sensible questions.
- It's my santouri. 
- Your what?
My santouri. 
Makes the best music.
It goes with me always.
And you, what are you go to do in Crete? With your permission.
I have some land there.
It belonged to my father.
And you go to write?
Not exactly.
What, exactly?
I haven't written anything in months.
On this land, there's an old mine.
- Lignite.
- Lignitis! I know!
It's been idle for years.
Why?
Because I let it.
And now you want to make it work.
If I can.
Yes.
I must.
Which way is it going?
- What?
- The weighing machine.
Zorba up, or Zorba down?
Well. I was thinking...
That mine...
I'm not very rich, and I will need someone with experience.
- So I...
- And so?
Well, although I...
I don't really know you very well...
And what I'm doing is probably mad.
It's yes.
Yes?
Yes.
Shake.
Mister, you are a lucky man.
When Zorba goes to work...
...no mine stands a chance.
Be wonderful to get down to some real work.
Also, it'll be good for the village.
I understand it's rather poor.
We make everybody happy.
And we'll have fun too.
We'll swim. And we'll drink wine.
And you'll play the santouri. 
What's the matter?
It's about the santouri. 
We make a bargain, or I cannot come.
In work, I am your man.
But in things like playing and singing, I am my own.
How do you mean?
I mean free.
You...
...you sign?
I sign.
- Here.
- But I don't drink rum.
This time you will.
Why start with the wrong foot?
Well, Zorba, God bless.
And the devil too, boss!
You like her, boss?
No.
Are you all right?
Sure.
Here.
Thanks, boss.
Your friend in there will be looking for you.
Incidentally, you never told me.
Are you married?
Am I not a man?
And is not a man stupid?
I'm a man. So I married.
Wife, children, house. Everything.
The full catastrophe.
What happened?
Be a pal, boss.
Don't make me talk.
And you?
No, I'm single.
I guess too many books.
Look! Look! A dolphin.
Why, yes.
What kind of a man are you?
Don't you even like dolphins?
- I hope we find somewhere to stay.
- Sure.
Have you never heard of Cretan hospitality?
Now, Mr. Epidemic, you behave yourself.
We don't want to start another war.
Boss, if there is a widow around, don't worry.
- What are they all saying?
- They all want us to stay with them.
Madame Hortense.
Who is that?
- Who's Madame Hortense?
- A French woman.
She has hotel.
I am Mavrandoni.
So you come at last. I welcome you.
- I'm glad to meet you. You got my letter?
- Yes.
Mr. Mavrandoni has been looking after our land.
This madame. She's a widow?
How many hairs on my head?
She's a widow of the same number of husbands.
Bonjour. 
Bonjour. 
Welcome, gentlemen.
This is a great pleasure, madame.
Two beds, madame.
Without bugs.
Monsieur, Madame Hortense has not the bugs.
You have to admit, boss. It is big.
But she shakes it well.
This way.
They say it was my grand success.
You may not believe it, monsieur, but I was a very famous artiste.
I appear in all the most chic cabarets.
I slept in the silk sheets with real lace.
- Boss, ask her to dance.
- What?
- Make a pass. Pinch her.
- No.
It's only polite.
What?
He would like to dance with you.
But he is shy.
Perhaps madame is tired.
She is not.
Are you?
Come on.
These Cretans. They are so ungrateful.
Don't cry, my little chouchou. 
They would be dead, all dead, if there was not me.
I know, I know.
- No hands.
- Madame.
Hey.
Boss. Match?
Madame.
You know how I came to Crete?
With the British fleet. Yes, monsieur.
I was in love with the admiral...
...and where he go, I go.
It was here that I met the other three.
What other three?
Admirals, of course.
The French, the Italian and the Russian.
How lovely they was, my four admirals...
...with their golden epaulets and all those feathers.
Like big, beautiful cockerels!
And what beards.
So soft, and curly and perfumed.
Fortunately, each has different perfume, so it was no mistake...
...even in the dark.
My little chouchou.  Here, here.
- My darling queen, please continue.
- Yes.
Me and my admirals...
...we sit on the deck...
...dressed very informal...
...and we discussion politics.
Very serious.
All the time they pour champagne over me to make me fresh.
It was summer, you know, very hot.
And in this time, in Crete...
...it was big trouble.
Revolution or something.
With my binoculars I could see the poor little Cretans...
...running in mountains with their flags.
My four admirals...
...they want to open the fire.
But I throw myself in the middle.
I pull the Italian by the beard...
You know, I was more familiar with him.
And I cry:
"Stop it, you can't kill them!
Please, Canavaro, Canavaro mio, no boom-boom!"
Canavaro? What the hell is that?
What you think it is?
Himself. Canavaro.
Canavaro mio. 
Go on, my chouchou. 
Again and again I stopped the boom-boom.
- And what do you think I get in the end?
- What?
What? Tell me.
Tell me what.
Nothing! No medals!
- Nothing!
- Please, no more boom-boom.
- You are laughing.
- No.
- At me.
- No, of course not.
Don't... Don't go.
That was a very bad thing we did, boss.
A poor, weak creature.
Where are you? Bouboulina?
Where are you?
My Bouboulina.
Bouboulina.
Go away.
It's me, your Canavaro.
Fine Canavaro you are.
No feathers.
No beard.
Here. Blow, my Bouboulina.
What's that, "Bouboulina"?
She was a big hero in the war against the Turks. Huh, boss?
Yes, madame. She was like you.
A great sea dog.
You see?
Yes.
Me too. I fought breasts to breasts.
But then came the bad times.
They make the peace...
...and the ship must go away.
"And me...
...what will become of me?" I cry.
Four times a widow.
They laughed, monsieur.
You men are so cruel.
In the end, they was sorry for me, so they undress me...
...they fill the bath with champagne...
...and they drop me.
Then they sit all around.
You understand that now that we was all very familiar.
And they drank all the champagne.
All, from the top to the bottom.
Then...
And then they put out the light.
When I waked up...
...I smelled so good.
All their perfume...
...one on top of the other.
But they was gone.
Men are so cruel.
Canavaro.
Hello?
Canavaro.
What is it?
Look.
Boss, a big, beautiful, wild widow.
Pavlo!
Look at Mavrandoni.
He is burning.
Why?
His son is crazy in love with the widow.
But she spits him in the eye.
The more she spits...
...the more he wants her.
Look.
Look at the faces of all these.
They all want her.
And they hate her because they cannot have her.
Only one man here...
...can.
Who?
You.
Rubbish.
I saw her eyes when she looked at you.
- Zorba, don't start.
- Listen.
God, who is a clever devil, today put in your hands a gift from paradise.
- Don't be silly.
- Boss. Why did God give us hands?
To grab. Well, grab.
- Boss.
- Yes.
Boss, listen. You go, you knock.
You say,
"I have come for my umbrella."
- She will say, "Please, please come in."
- No.
Boss. Boss, don't make me mad.
I don't want any trouble.
Boss. Life is trouble, only death is not.
To be alive is to undo your belt and look for trouble.
Well?
No.
Zorba!
What?
For God's sake, boss.
Will you go back to your papers?
Zorba?
Get out.
Get out!
Zorba!
You bastard mountain!
I'll eat your guts!
What is it, Zorba?
They left axes inside, that's what.
They are so brave, every time they hear a noise, they mess their pants!
Zorba, leave them alone!
- Axes cost money.
- I know, and I don't care!
Right now I'm just glad that nobody's hurt. That's all.
And what's more, I think you should let them go for today.
Boss.
You better make up your mind. Are you or are you not a gosh darn capitalist?
I'm hungry.
We've got to find some strong trees...
...to make beams for the galleries.
Hello.
You're late.
What is it, Zorba?
Out with it.
Boss...
Do you trust me?
Yes, I do.
Why the hell do you?
- Because you are you.
- But you don't understand.
My brain is not the right weight.
It... It gives me such crazy ideas.
I might ruin you.
I'll take that chance.
Say that again, boss.
Give me courage.
I'll take that chance.
Boss.
- Boss.
- What?
- Do you dance?
- Dance? No, no.
Then get out of the way.
I... I may knock you down.
Zorba!
That's enough!
Stop. Stop.
Go!
Zorba. Zorba!
Are you all right?
Now...
Now, I can...
I can talk again.
What on earth came over you?
When a man is full...
...what can he do?
Burst?
When my little boy, Dimitri, died...
...everybody was crying.
Me?
I got up...
...and I danced.
They said:
"Zorba is mad."
But it was the dancing...
...only the dancing that stopped the pain.
You see, he was my first.
And he was only 3.
When I'm happy...
...it's the same thing.
Come inside. You'll catch cold.
With your permission.
Now...
...will you tell me what this is all about?
- I got a plan.
- What plan?
A great, big, crazy plan.
Well, what?
- I cannot tell you.
- Why?
I got many things to be figuring:
Trees, monks, machines.
Tomorrow, maybe.
Tonight we celebrate.
Come on! Don't be delicate.
- Boss.
- What?
Come and see.
Do you remember that plan
I could not tell you about?
- Here it is.
- What is it?
It's a mountain. That one.
Oh, yes.
Look.
That's the way we'll get the trees down.
An overhead cable? You're mad.
Why?
Well, to begin with that forest doesn't belong to us.
Well it doesn't, and it does.
What does that mean?
It belongs to the monastery.
The monastery belongs to God.
And God belongs to everybody.
You agree?
No, I certainly don't.
All right, you will pay them something...
...but not much.
- How do you know?
They are friends of mine.
If it works, we will bring down the whole forest.
First we get the mine going.
Then open a timber factory.
We get stinking rich, then make our own ship and sail around the world.
Aren't you going a little too fast?
Do you know how old I am?
Never mind, that's a secret.
But I have got to go fast.
You know, they... They say that age kills the fire inside of a man.
That he hears death coming.
He opens the door and says,
"Come in. Give me rest."
That is a pack of old damn lies!
I've got enough fight in me to devour the world.
So I fight.
Well? Do we?
Or do we let the mountain win?
Tell me what you need.
I will need some strong wire, hooks and... And things.
I will have to go to town.
I still have to figure out the angle.
If it's not perfect, it will be catastrophe.
How long will it take you?
The way things are going, it had better be soon or not at all.
I'll give you until Christmas.
Hey, boss.
Rose water.
- Boss?
- Well? What news?
I made a great discovery.
Stones are alive.
Well, that's fine.
Well, I wish instead you'd discover your famous angle.
I'm trying, boss.
- Look, your umbrella.
- Never mind.
Just let me remind you that tomorrow's Christmas.
I know.
Wh...? Where are you going?
I need some wire.
Where the hell did I put it?
Won't this string do?
Excuse me.
Look.
A melomakarouna.
- A what?
- A Christmas cookie.
Well, what's so strange about that?
Nothing.
But many melomakarouna inside an empty trunk is very strange.
- An umbrella under a bed is also strange.
- All right, all right.
- She came here?
- No. She sent them.
Now you have the proof.
Now, it is very simple.
- Tonight, after Bouboulina's party...
- Get on with your work.
Boss, you want me to beat you an egg?
It's good for the strength.
Boss, now I can tell you a secret.
All these days I couldn't work,
I couldn't sleep.
And you know why?
Because of the widow.
Don't get me wrong, I know she's too good for these old bones.
But to think of her without anybody...
...that was too much.
All right, laugh, but remember this.
If a woman sleeps alone, it puts a shame on all men.
God has a very big heart...
...but there is one sin he will not forgive:
If a woman calls a man to her bed and he will not go.
I know, because a very wise, old Turk told me.
A Turk? And you, a Greek, believed him?
I'm going to wash.
I thought the Greeks and the Turks never talked.
They just fought.
Don't tell me you never went to war.
I don't like that kind of stupid talk.
What's so stupid about...
...fighting for your country?
- Excuse me, boss.
You talk like a teacher.
You think like a teacher.
How can you understand?
Of course I can.
With your head, yes.
You say, "This is right.
This is wrong."
But when you talk...
...I watch your arms...
...your legs, your chest.
They are dumb.
They say nothing.
- So how can you understand?
- You're just making up excuses.
I don't believe you give a damn about your country.
Don't you talk to me like that!
Look, here, and here and here.
Nothing on the back!
I have done things for my country that would make your hair stand.
I have killed, burned villages, raped women.
And why?
Because they were Turks or Bulgarians.
That's the rotten damn fool I was.
Now I look at a man, any man, and I say, "He is good. He is bad."
What do I care if he's Greek or Turk?
As I get older,
I swear by the bread I eat.
I even stop asking that.
Good or bad, what is the difference?
They all end up the same way...
...food for worms.
And as for women, you make fun of me that I love them.
How can I not love them?
They're such poor, weak creatures.
And it takes so little.
A man's hand on their breast...
...and they give you all they've got.
Where are you, Bouboulina?
Canavaro is here.
Chouchou!
Look what I brought you.
- Merci. 
- Happy Christmas!
I made it myself to make her feel good.
- It's me?
- Yes.
- Merry Christmas, madame.
- And also for you.
What is that extraordinary smell coming from the kitchen?
- It is a big fat Turkish.
- A Turkish.
- I hope he's not burning.
- Do not worry. Sit down.
We will start from the center, the belly.
Then we will take care of the other parts, later.
Yes.
Merci. 
Aren't you feeling well?
In my age, monsieur, one is never well.
Especially on the holidays.
I drink to your health, my beautiful chouchou mermaid.
May you grow new teeth...
...and new skin...
...and throw away these stupid ribbons you wear to hide your neck.
May the Great Powers come back to Crete.
And when you rise out of the waves to greet them...
...may all their damn ships crash...
...on these round, hard rocks.
I wish it could happen, what you say.
- But it is too late.
- No, it is not!
Please, no!
Are you all right?
You see, it is too late.
Oh, don't be sad, my little Bouboulina.
I have heard of a new doctor in Europe.
He makes miracles.
You take what the hell ever he gives you, drops or powders...
...and you become 20 again.
Maybe 25.
I will get you some.
- You will?
- Sure.
- A big bottle?
- A whole barrel.
Here.
What are you thinking?
Alexandria, Beirut, Istanbul.
How they loved me.
Who?
Everybody.
Ali Bey, Mustafa Nahas Pasha.
Suleiman Pasha. Especially Suleiman.
Those damn cats.
Well, I...
What?
- She's asleep?
- Yes.
Let her.
She's 20 again.
She's strolling around Alexandria, Beirut.
Look at her, smiling.
Silly old bitch. Come on.
We can't go and just leave her alone.
She's not alone. She is with
Suleiman Pasha, having hell of a time.
Dirty old cow.
She is in.
Go.
And God bless you.
- Where are you going?
- To church.
- I've never been to a Greek Christmas.
- Boss!
- No. Don't you understand?
- You're young, full of energy.
I don't understand what you're doing with it.
I've had enough of this.
Why don't you leave me alone?
I love you, and I want the best for you.
- Don't shout!
- Who's shouting!
There she is. She is waiting.
- Cigarette.
- This is ridiculous.
- I'm not going to stand here arguing.
- But, boss...
...she is waiting for you.
- Let's just say that I'm different...
...and I've got to go my own way.
If God went your way, there would be no Christmas.
He didn't go to church, he went to Mary.
And Christ was born.
He went that way. Mary is the widow.
On a deaf man's door, you can knock forever!
Ever.
- Now, here's the money.
- Thank you.
And remember, it's all I can afford.
- Poor boss, I know.
- Just buy what we need for the cable...
...and come straight back.
- Of course.
- Don't get stuck anywhere on the way.
- I will be quick like the wind.
- Five days. You promised.
- Boss, I promise.
Goodbye, boss.
Zorba. Zorba!
What do you want?
Don't forget me.
Yes. Goodbye.
Don't be sad. He's coming back.
They all say that.
Garçon! Champagne.
"I shall not describe you...
...the continuation.
Except to say...
...that it was long and very wild."
Very, very wild.
Next afternoon...
Next afternoon...
...I wake up.
And...
...what do I see?
Next to me, in bed...
...the female sex...
...in person.
Soft...
...and warm...
...and sweet-smelling.
So I say to myself:
"Zorba...
...you are in paradise.
Enjoy it.
Don't move."
Imagine what luck. 
There's a restaurant opposite... 
... and they sends us food,
splendiferous food. Caviar... 
... steaks, baklava, everything. 
We eat and back to work,
and back to sleep and so on, et cetera. 
Antoni!
This is my good news, boss. And don't
worry, I think of your business also. 
But I ask you, why push things?
Every day my head becomes more clear... 
... and I shall be able
to make the best deals. 
I kiss you friendly. Me, Zorba. 
P.S., I forgot to tell you. 
Her name is Lola. 
Monsieur.
Pardon. They told me you had a letter.
It's from him?
It's from him.
What does he say?
Read it yourself.
I cannot.
My eyes.
He says...
...he's very busy.
There is something for me?
Of course.
Read it.
Please.
"Please tell Bouboulina that I miss her."
Go on.
"Tell her...
...that every night I go back to my little room...
...and I pray to God to send me back to her...
...quickly.
For without my Bouboulina...
...I feel so damn miserable...
...that when I see her again I...
...I'll..."
What?
"I'll kneel before her...
...and ask her to be mine forever."
Forever?
Yes, forever. That's what he says.
All right.
Tell him that I accept.
And please, write that he brings me...
...5 meters of white satin...
...and voile.
You see, I cannot find here.
I understand.
You are very kind.
One thing more.
You know...
...Zorba and me, we like you very much.
Will you be our witness?
It will be an honor.
I'm sorry.
Mr. Zorba.
Boss!
Oh, boss.
You stink of perfume, Mr. Zorba.
Yes, I know. I scrubbed my skin for two hours, but it still smells. It's funny.
Isn't it?
Well, what's all this?
- Presents.
- Presents!
- Who the hell for?
- Barba Antoni, Yianni.
This...
...is for poor little Bouboulina.
- I hope it's a wedding dress.
A what?
Well, you heard me.
Boss...
...what have you been cooking up?
Well she was here when your letter came.
I couldn't very well read to her what was in it.
Could I?
That was not a very good joke, boss.
What about the stuff for the overhead cable?
I got everything.
Don't worry.
A gift for you.
A box of English chocolates.
Thank you.
It's all right.
Hey, no more fooling around.
Not in this place.
Now we pull up our pants and we make some money, a pile of money.
You are incorrigible.
I don't know what that means, but here.
With my compliments.
Good God.
What have you done to your hair?
- I painted it.
- Why?
For pride. So I could go out with Lola, without making her ashamed.
He laughs. But listen, you know what?
I became young like my hair.
Stronger than a bull.
You ask Lola.
And you know that pain in my kidneys?
That's gone.
Figure that out!
By the way, boss...
...I come in last night, and you were out.
Where the hell are you?
I...
...couldn't help.
Why do the young die?
Why does anybody die? Tell me.
I don't know.
What's the use of all your damn books?
If they don't tell you that, what the hell do they tell you?
They tell me...
...about the agony of men...
...who can't answer questions like yours.
I spit on their agony.
Who's that?
It's me.
- Boss.
- Get her inside, quickly.
Hey.
Did you get drenched?
You are cruel.
Why you abandon me?
I will make some coffee.
The whole village, they're laughing at me.
Where is my white satin?
Where is my wedding dress?
In Crete...
...you don't find the real good satin.
No!
So...
...I ordered some.
From Athens.
Yes.
Also some white candles...
...with silk ribbons.
And pink bonbonnières.
Our wedding, my dear Bouboulina...
...will be so splendiferous...
...it will blind the world with glory.
I can no longer keep it a secret.
I have engaged the best tailors in Athens...
...to make for you a dress like nobody has seen in the East.
Or the West.
Twenty meters of white satin covered in pearls.
With the sun on one breast and the moon on the other.
In pure gold.
Me too.
I have a secret for you.
What's that?
Open it.
- I'll have some coffee first.
- No.
Now.
You see what you've done.
Where the hell did you get these rings?
I had them made for us.
From two golden sovereign the English admiral gave me.
I was keeping them for my...
For what?
My funeral.
Zorba?
Please. We become fiancés. 
Now.
- But...
- We have the witness.
We have the rings.
Please?
But we have no priest.
I don't mind.
God is watching.
No?
All right.
We go outside where God can see us better.
You, you get ready.
Witness, come on.
What do we do?
Can you sing?
- Certainly not.
- Never mind, I can.
Weddings, baptisms, funerals,
I know them back to front.
I was a boy chanter.
It's nothing.
Just a cold.
Tomorrow you'll feel better.
Next Sunday we go out, have a hell of a time.
It's Easter, you know.
Yes.
Yes.
You need some sun to cheer you up.
Now, my beautiful.
We pull everything away.
Listen to that...
...beautiful noise.
Like kissing.
Very sexy.
I'm jealous.
- I don't want...
- No.
- I don't know what...
- It's all right.
Canavaro.
Canavaro.
It's me, Zorba.
Don't be afraid.
He asks us to drink to her soul.
Zorba, what about the funeral?
There will be no funeral.
Why?
She was a Frank.
She crossed herself with four fingers.
But I don't understand.
The priest will not bury her like everybody else.
- But that's dreadful.
- Why?
She is dead.
It makes no difference.
Hey, boss!
Boss!
Come on. We are nearly ready.
Hey, Canavaro, you want to come and watch too?
Come on.
It's nothing. It's nothing!
The first time it always does that.
Boss, where are you, boss?
It's nothing.
Hey, Canavaro. How are you?
- The lamb!
- What?
It will burn!
You know...
...people tell the future from this.
Can you?
Everything's fine.
We will live a thousand years.
Oh, I see a journey.
A big journey to a city.
With big houses.
How soon, boss?
I don't know.
A few days.
What will I do...
...without your company?
Cheer up.
We'll get together again.
No.
You'll go away and stay.
With your books.
Your health.
Yours, Zorba.
Damn it, boss,
I like you too much not to say it.
You've got everything...
...except one thing:
Madness.
A man needs a little madness, or else...
Or else?
He never dares cut the rope and be free.
Are you angry with me?
Teach me to dance.
Will you?
Dance?
Did you say dance?
Come on, my boy.
Together.
Let's go.
Again.
Down.
Boss...
...I have so much to tell you.
I never loved a man more than you.
Hey, boss...
...did you ever see a more splendiferous crash?
You can laugh too, huh?
Hey, you laugh!
You saw... You saw how they all ran.
Especially the monks.
The second time...
The third time was the best.
Nothing left!
Sorry we got you up at this hour, Mr Grant.
I thought I was on vacation.
What's it all about?
I can't tell you.
- Where are we goin'?
- I can't tell you that either.
You're to stay inside, Mr Grant, and wait.
Your ID card, please.
Thank you.
- Hello, Grant.
- General Carter.
- Good to see you again.
- The Pentagon, wasn't it?
Come on.
Benes! What the devil happened?
The other side got to him.
- How bad off is he?
- Brain injury. He's in a coma.
Before or after what he wanted to say?
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows what we're after.
That's why we have to operate.
And why we need you.
Me? I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Here's the surgeon. Duval.
Dr Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country.
Ever hear of him?
- I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
- Cora Peterson, his technical assistant.
- You'll be joining Duval and the others.
- What can I do? Except pass out.
Mike?
Yes, Alan.
Meet Grant.
Dr Michaels, chief of the medical section.
- Glad to have you with us.
- I wish I knew why.
Tell him where he fits in.
I've got a few things to check out.
We need you for security purposes, Mr Grant.
- At an operation?
- They know they failed to kill Benes.
Security thinks they'll try again. We're afraid of sabotage: surgical assassination.
- Surgical assassination? You suspect...?
- Duval. That's right.
I don't agree. Just because he's difficult...
- He's impossible.
- It's no reason to suspect disloyalty.
There must be other doctors.
Duval's the most skilful brain surgeon in the country - and he's right here at hand.
- I wouldn't know if he's trying to kill him.
- I'll be standing by. I would know.
You're to take orders only from Dr Michaels.
Understand?
- Right, sir.
- Come along. They'll be operating shortly.
See you later, Mike.
His technician OK? In addition to the looks?
No question of her loyalty.
- I'll take that, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
I don't mean to be inquisitive, but this CMDF.
For all I know, it could stand for Consolidated
Mobilisation of Delinquent Females.
Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces.
Say that again.
We can reduce anything down to any size.
People, ships, tanks, planes.
I've heard some wild ones, but this takes it.
We can shrink an army.
Put it in a bottle cap.
That's why we call it
Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces.
If the other side gets that...
They have.
But we both have the same problem: lack of control.
They can only miniaturise things for exactly 60 minutes.
After that everything starts growing back to its original size.
- I assume Benes knows howto control it.
- Yes. He wanted us to have the secret.
- That's why they tried to kill him.
- They'll try again.
No wonder you want me to stand by at the operation.
And take a little trip with him.
Trip? Where to?
The only way we can reach that clot is from inside the brain.
So we'll put a surgical team and crew into a submarine, reduce it way down in size and inject it into an artery.
- You mean I'm going along?
- As part of the crew, yes.
Wait a minute. They can't shrink me.
- We can shrink anything.
- I don't want to be miniaturised.
- It's just for an hour.
- Not even for a minute.
Sir, I really think you should reconsider.
I just don't think I'm right for this job.
Grant, you're going to a briefing.
Miss Peterson volunteered to come.
So did every male technician. A woman has no place on a mission of this kind.
- I insist on taking my technician.
- You'll take along who I assign.
Don't tell me who I'm going to work with - not on this operation.
I'll do what I think is best without interference!
Dr Duval has relied on Miss Peterson for years.
And since she wants to come along,
I think it's for the best, Dr Reid.
Well, I disagree with you.
Since you're in charge, do as you please.
But I want it on record I'm against it.
Grant, Colonel Reid, operational commander.
You met our medical chief.
- Dr Duval, head surgeon.
- I've heard of you.
Miss Peterson, his assistant.
And Captain Bill Owens, designer of an experimental submarine for the Navy's research programme.
- Out of your element, Captain?
- Sort of.
- That makes two of us.
- Grant is uniquely suited to this mission.
He's a communications expert and he was a frogman during the war.
Besides, he brought Benes into this country.
The fewer people who knowthat, the better.
You'll find Grant invaluable should anything go wrong once you're underway.
OK, Don.
Here's the overall target area.
Doctor?
Benes's brain.
As near as we can map it stereotaxically.
The clot is right here.
It's impossible to get at without damage to the intervening tissue, which would prove fatal to Benes.
The only way to reach it is via the arterial system.
Phase one calls for miniaturising a submarine, with crew and surgical team, and injecting it into the carotid artery.
How small will it be?
About the size of a microbe.
We're putting Benes in deep hypothermia.
What?
That's freezing him as low as is compatible with human life.
It'll slow down his heartbeat, circulation and all other physical processes.
Even so, Colonel, because of our size -
I mean, the lack of it - we'll still be cruising pretty fast.
We'll be smashed to bits if there's turbulence.
The only danger of turbulence is in the heart, and we're not going through it.
Once in the carotid artery, we remain within the arterial system until we reach the point of the damage, where Dr Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam.
Thank you.
After the operation, we return by way of the venous system until we reach the base of the neck, where we'll be removed right here. With a hypodermic.
How will you know where the sub is at any moment?
Dr Michaels is a circulatory specialist and will act as your navigator.
He'll know where you are and you can communicate directly with us by wireless.
Also the sub is nuclear powered. We'll track it just as we would any radioactive tracer.
There'll be surgeons standing by to remove you immediately should anything happen.
In any event, you must be out within 60 minutes.
After that, you're in danger of attack.
Attack? Who? Or should I say what from?
Benes's natural defences.
White corpuscles, antibodies.
You see, once you begin to grow, you become a menace to the body and you'll trigger them off.
And there may be other, unknown, factors.
We can't be certain of anything.
Any further questions? Anybody?
- Just one, General.
- What's that?
Where do I get a cab backto town?
Dr Michaels, proceed to the sterilisation section.
Yes, sir.
Will you follow me?
How much can a man give to his country?
Your attention, please.
Make the final preparations.
Heart.
How's it look, Henry?
Holding steady. 32 per minute.
Respiration.
Jack, what's the report?
Respiration is down to six a minute.
I wouldn't take him down any further.
Hypothermia.
Any problems, Dr Sawyer?
No, sir.
We're holding him at 28 degrees Centigrade.
- How do we stand?
- Ready.
They're now entering the sterilisation corridor, sir.
Please board and check all your equipment immediately.
Here's the particle, sir.
- Everything aboard?
- All squared away.
Dr Michaels.
- Yes?
- Here's your chart table right here.
All the maps and charts are in sequence from left to right.
- And here's your checklist.
- Dr Duval and I will checkthe charts.
Fine. Mr Grant?
- This is your wireless station here.
- Good.
- Ocular motor nerve.
- I see.
- Need any help, skipper?
- Oh, yeah. We'll save some time.
Open this, would you? Set it down there.
- Where? On the deck here?
- Yeah, right there.
- That's radioactive material.
- It's atomic fuel.
- Is it all right to open it?
- Perfectly safe.
There's a microscopic radioactive particle inside.
Nothing big enough to be seen with the naked eye.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
They can't reduce nuclear fuel.
But once the reactor's been miniaturised, a microscopic particle should put out enough energy to activate it.
That's cutting it close for a perfect fit.
Well, it should work, theoretically.
If it doesn't, the whole mission's off.
You see, this craft is nuclear powered.
All except for your wireless.
All in all, quite a canoe.
Designed for piscatorial research: spawning habits of deep-sea fish.
That reminds me,
I'd better spawn a radio message.
Test message from the Proteus, sir.
"Miss Peterson has smiled. "
Well, that's an auspicious sign.
Confirm receiving.
Captain?
How will you be able to follow my charts from up there?
There's no power on now, but once there is...
May I have this chart, please?
You just place the chart here and it will come through on that repeater.
- Repeater?
- Yeah, the devi...
Come on, I'll show you.
- There, that's it.
- Oh, yes.
It all seems quite simple to operate.
Actually, it is, although the controls are highly sophisticated.
Look here.
There's a button and a switch for everything.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house.
Can you cook?
We're pushing oxygen today.
I'll have some laughing gas.
You're not looking forward to it?
It's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
I think it's very exciting.
We're going to see things no one has ever seen before.
Not just something under a microscope.
- Think about it.
- That's the trouble, I am.
- Being shrunk!
- You may learn to like it.
Excuse me.
For a nice young lady, you play with the damnedest toys, Miss Peterson.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Now I know.
That could be quite a lethal weapon.
It could kill, not cure.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr Duval.
The beam from this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimetre.
You've been Dr Duval's assistant for some time.
- He must have snatched you out of a cradle!
- I've been with him since I got out of school.
He brought me into the CMDF over five years ago.
- That's a long time with one man.
- Not working with someone like Dr Duval.
He's...
Well...
- Prepare for miniaturisation.
- Positions, please.
- I still have something to check.
- Right. Mr Grant?
There are two seats under the chart table.
Would you pull them out, please?
Secure your safety belts.
Miss Peterson, this is your chair right here.
- Doctor, let me help you.
- No, it's all right. I can manage.
- Doctor?
- Yes, Cora.
I...
I wanted to say that...
What is it? Is anything wrong?
No, nothing. I... just wanted to say... thank you for taking me along.
Thank you for volunteering.
Right, Mr Grant.
You can tell them the Proteus is ready.
- The Proteus? What's that?
- The name of this vessel.
Sounds better than calling it the U-91035.
Proteus reports all secured, sir.
Miniaturiser.
All stations, stand by.
All medical posts, stand by.
Check scanner. Computer 9-5.
Checks out on radar.
Instruct computer for a plus 6-0-9.
Phase one.
- Colonel?
- OK to proceed.
Phase two.
Elevate zero module.
Lower zero module.
Halt and transfer.
HDR in order.
Elevate zero module.
We'll submerge manually.
Mr Grant, open induction valves one and two.
- Where are they?
- There's one port and one starboard.
On the bulkhead right behind you.
- I'll get the other.
- Fine.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Induction valve open.
Valve open.
Close valves.
Valve closed.
Right. That's all for the present.
- I can't breathe.
- Dr Michaels.
- Dr Michaels!
- I've got to get out.
It's too late for that.
Now, we must go on.
I'm sorry. I...
I've got claustrophobia. I was...
I was buried alive in an air raid in England.
Two days.
I thought I'd got over it.
Please forgive me.
I'll really be all right now.
Come on.
You'll feel better once we're underway.
Thank you.
Lock and hold.
- OK, Colonel.
- OK.
Phase three.
All stations, 60 and counting.
- Inform Proteusthey are at full reduction.
- Yes, sir.
- At full reduction.
- Right.
- That air feels good.
- Yes.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm OK.
Mr Grant, tell them the Proteus is on power.
- Proteus on power, sir.
- OK, Don, it's all yours.
Phase four.
Elevate zero module.
Check thermal blanket.
Tracking.
Contact Proteus.
- Stand by for injection.
- Right.
Inject.
Tracking post.
The medieval philosophers were right.
Man is the centre of the universe.
We stand in the middle of infinity, between outer and inner space.
And there's no limit to either.
I never imagined it could be anything like this.
- No, I always thought it was nothing but red.
- Only to the naked eye.
Those corpuscles carrying oxygen give the stream its colour.
The rest of the plasma's very much like sea water.
- An ocean of life.
- End to end, 100,000 miles long.
Dr Duval?
What could those be?
That looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
I don't agree.
- We should stop and investigate.
- I'm afraid we haven't time.
Captain, keep your present heading until we're in the clear.
Arterial wall to the left.
- What's our speed?
- 15 knots.
You should reach the main branching artery in two minutes.
Keep the wall at this distance when you turn.
That should bring you safely into the middle of the branch.
- Captain, correctyour course and speed.
- She won't respond. We're in a current.
- That isn't possible.
- Not in a sealed vessel like an artery.
There's something wrong with your controls.
No, it's a current. It's too strong.
I can't seem to break out of it.
Whirlpool. Strap yourselves in.
Anyone hurt?
Cora?
I'm all right. Thank you, Doctor.
Where are we?
The corpuscles are blue.
Captain, what's your compass heading?
Proteus off course.
They've... they've crossed over into the jugular vein!
That can't be. There's no direct connection between the two.
Well, normally not.
Unless there's an arteriovenous fistula.
A what?
It's a forced joining of a vein and an artery.
It must have happened when Benes was hurt.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up in the tests.
- But big enough for us.
- Can you head back into the artery?
No, we can't fight that current.
It's impossible.
Well, try not to drift down any further.
I'll do what I can.
Is there an alternate route?
We can go forward on this course but... that means going directly through the heart.
No, we can't do that either.
We decided in the briefing.
This craft couldn't stand the turbulence.
It would be a hundred times worse than the whirlpool.
That's just dandy!
We can't go forward and we can't go back.
There's only one thing we can do.
Call off the mission.
We've no choice. We've got to take them out.
No. We've still got 51 minutes. Leave 'em in.
But it's hopeless.
They can't go back and they can't go on.
There's no choice but to remove them.
Not until the last second. We gotta think of something to save the situation.
Proteus reports trapped in venous system.
Requests removal, sir.
Well, there it is.
What do I tell them, General?
Doctor...
Without killing him, how long could we stop his heart?
- The less time the better.
- I know, but what's the maximum?
In his comatose state and everything slowed down, no more than 60 seconds.
At top speed, adjusting distance for degree of miniaturisation, that sub should get through the heart in exactly 57 seconds.
That's only three seconds to revive him.
What are the problems involved in stopping the heart?
Nothing - compared with starting it up again.
We're wasting time. Let's get on with it.
Message to Proteus.
- Cardiac red alert.
- Maintaining maximum speed, the sub should get through the heart in 57 seconds.
This will allow us three seconds to spare in which to revive him.
To minimise the turbulence we will have to arrest the heart.
Prepare for cardiac shock. Remove the radar.
The Proteus will proceed to the entrance of the right atrium, at which point the heart will be stopped - by electric shock.
57 seconds.
And if it takes longer to get through?
We can't take a second more.
Captain, head in the direction of the flow and then drift with it.
Well, that looks pretty complicated.
I shall be able to guide you once we're inside.
Ready for cardiac shock.
Cardioscope.
Tracking.
Listen. The heart.
- Yes. It's slowed down a great deal.
- Sounds like heavy artillery.
It lays down quite a barrage.
Over 40 million beats in a year.
And every beat separates a man from eternity.
Stand by.
They're about to stop the heart.
Full power when we enter the valve.
Hit it!
24 seconds left. Including three to revive him.
19 seconds, Doctor.
The semilunar valve should be on our left any second now.
Stand by to revive.
- There it is.
- Bear to your left.
- Can you see it, Captain?
- Yes. I see it now.
Brace yourselves. There'll be a tremendous surge when the heart starts up again.
If it does.
Eight seconds left.
Now!
They're in the pulmonary artery.
They'll make up time once they get through that and reach the pleural cavity.
Respiration post.
- What's his rate, Jack?
- Back to six per minute.
Dammit! I just had them cleaned.
They all lead to the same place: the lungs.
Dr Michaels, the channel is getting awfully narrow.
Yes, we're entering a capillary.
Try to stay in the middle.
The wall's transparent.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Doctor, just think of it.
We're the first ones to actually see it happen.
The living process.
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
It's just a simple exchange, Mr Grant.
Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide in return for oxygen coming through on the other side.
- Don't tell me they're refuelling!
- Oxygenation.
We've known it exists even though we never saw it.
Like the structure of the atom.
But to actually see one of the miracles of the universe, the engineering of the cycle of a breath...
I wouldn't call it a miracle.
Just an interchange of gases.
The end product of 500 million years of evolution.
You can't believe all that is accidental? That there isn't a creative intelligence at work?
Well, the creative...
- Mr Grant?
- Yes, skipper?
I'm losing pressure in the flotation tanks.
Check the manual control panel.
It's aft on the starboard side.
The left tank's losing pressure.
There must be a short in the electrical valve circuit system.
Yeah.
That takes care of the valves. I suppose it happened because of that electric shock.
- Is there any damage?
- Not to the valve.
But we've lost so much air we can't make it the rest of the way.
What do you propose to do, Captain?
There's nothing we can do.
We can't continue without full tanks.
- Any reserve air?
- Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber, one of the countless alveoli of the lung, and we can't get enough air to fill a microscopic tank!
Maybe we can.
- Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
- Yes, there is.
Could I run a tube through that wall without harming Benes?
At our present size, I should think so, certainly.
If those corpuscles can take on air, there's no reason why we can't.
All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.
- How's that sound to you, skipper?
- Well, it's a dangerous procedure.
If I miss the timing we could explode the air tanks, but...
I'm willing to try it.
I think we should.
Yes, of course. We must try it.
One more thing. It'll be safer if everybody leaves the sub but me.
I'll get the equipment.
Cora?
- You didn't fasten it down too well.
- But I did! I'm positive.
- Then how come it worked loose?
- I've no idea.
How badly is it damaged?
I don't know. We'll have to test it.
That'll have to wait until after we're refuelled.
I can't imagine how it could have happened.
I distinctly remember fastening it down.
Must've been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
Better get these on as quickly as possible.
They've stopped on the outer limits of the left lung.
Another delay, with only 42 minutes left.
It'll be close but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find out what's holding them up.
Contact the Proteus.
Must be some kind of mechanical difficulty.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.
Oh, I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
- Shouldn'tyou answer that?
- Not now. We need air, not greetings.
- It's full of rocks.
- Those are impurities embedded in the lung.
Carbon from smoke and specks of dust.
Well, we'd better get on with it.
Careful! There's a tremendous air pressure in there in relation to our size.
I'll hold her from the other side of the wall.
Maybe that will do it.
- Tie my safety line to the sub.
- Here. Let me have it.
All right, now. Push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
Wait for the lull - between the time he inhales and exhales.
Now!
Full.
He's gone!
What can we do?
"Delay caused by stop to refuel air. "
"Proceeding through pleural cavity. "
"Refuel air"?
Why not?
They had a choice of over a billion alveoli.
And a broken trigger wire.
A smashed transistor.
No way to fire the lamp.
Well, that's the end of the laser.
- You must carry spare parts.
- Nothing that's built into the chassis.
- If it only hadn't come loose!
- That's beside the point now.
- Isn't there another operation you could try?
- No. No, there's no other way.
I don't see the sense in going on with this.
- But we must!
- With no laser?
If you had a transistor about this size and power output and a thin enough wire, could you mend it?
Yes, but it requires absolute precision.
A surgeon might.
Yes. Yes, I could do it.
Well, if I had the parts!
I've got a source. All we have to do is tap it.
Grant, just a minute. You're surely not going to dismantle the wireless?
It's just one transistor and a circuit wire.
That'll knock out our communications.
We'll be cutting ourselves off.
They'd still be able to track us by radar because of the radioactive fuel.
What's it to be? The wireless, or Benes's life?
Send a message to the control tower.
Message from the Proteus, sir.
"Cannibalising wireless to repair laser. "
- They're what?
- "This is our last message. "
Incommunicado!
Now they're really on their own.
We can track 'em, but that's all we can do.
Something told me I got into the wrong end of this business.
Inner space...!
The transistor will do, but the wire is much too thick.
- There's nothing closer.
- Let me see.
I might be able to scrape it thin enough.
Cora, would you bring me a number 11 scalpel, please?
Yes, Doctor.
Looks like the sea at dawn.
We're safe as long as it remains that colour.
We're in the pleural sac.
It keeps the lungs from rubbing against the wall of the chest. Up there.
When those membranes become inflamed we get pleurisy and a racking cough.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just breathing...!
His pleura's in fine condition.
Should be plain sailing from here on.
Let's hope so.
So far, someone's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
Sabotage?
I don't quite understand.
I sawthe laser before we started.
It was fastened down securely.
What happened was no accident.
Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub.
- Surely you don't suspect Duval.
- That line was tampered with.
I don't know what to say.
I know he's under a cloud, but... there's not a more dedicated man in medicine.
We still never know anyone's mind.
I don't believe it. It was an accident.
- Two in a row?
- It's possible.
Look at those walls up ahead.
We're entering the lymphatic system.
Those are nuclei of cells lining a duct.
I always had an idea there was only one system: the circulatory.
The lymphatic system drains off excess fluid from the tissues.
Without it, we'd all blow up like balloons.
- Looks like quite a navigation problem.
- Only until we get through the nodes.
The lymphatic glands.
- Keep your present compass heading.
- Right.
We're picking up seaweed, or whatever that is.
Reticular fibres.
We ought to be clear of them soon.
Well, I hope so, Doctor.
Because if that stuff clogs the vents, the engines will overheat.
What's causing all this?
- Looks like somebody declared war.
- That's exactly what it is.
Antibodies destroying bacteria or any other foreign invader that threatens the system.
Look! It's taken on its exact shape.
- It's like hand in glove.
- Much closer. Like two atoms.
We'll never get there in time at this rate.
Isn't there another route to bypass all this?
- No.
- Yes!
- There's no other suitable route.
- Yes, there is.
We can transfer to the inner ear.
And go by way of the endolymphatic duct.
- Why don't we take it?
- Because it's more hazardous than the route we're following now.
You see, once in the ear, any noise at all in the operating theatre would be disastrous.
At our reduced size, any vibrations inside the ear would have a shattering effect.
Well, they're tracking us. Once they see where we're going they'll take precautions.
All right.
Let's hope they realise the danger.
Captain, I'll give you a new heading.
Proteus turning, in quadrant 7-3.
Finally. They're heading for the inner ear.
About time they realised they'd never make it the other way.
Your attention, please.
Proteus is about to enter the inner ear.
You are not to walk, talk, or make a sound of any kind.
Absolute silence must be maintained until they are out of the danger area.
- What's wrong, skipper?
- What I was afraid would happen.
That stuff we passed through that looks like seaweed?
Yes, reticular fibres.
It clogged the intake vents.
We're not getting any propulsion.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
What?
I'll see if maybe there's some way
I can clear those vents.
How long do you think it'll take?
Quite some time.
- Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
- You're right. We haven't a minute to spare.
- Would you...?
- Oh, yes.
I'll stay behind.
I'd better use the time to finish repairing the laser.
Why don'tyou start on the engines?
Report no movement of the Proteus since entering quadrant 7-4 at level D.
24 minutes left, maximum.
This is just what we need. Another delay.
You'll wind up a Hindu.
They respect all forms of life, however small.
Help!
Please help!
There she is.
She's damaging those fibres.
Antibodies will attack any moment.
Grant?
The pressure. I...
- I can't...
- Get backto the sub. I'll get her out.
Hurry!
- Where are they?
- They're belowthe cells of Hensen.
If the antibodies reach her, they'll attack as if she were bacteria.
Open it! Open it before they get here.
I can't till the hatch is flooded.
They're tightening!
Please! I... can't... breathe.
I can't...
They've crystallised.
It's all right, Cora. It's all right.
They're on their way again.
12 minutes left.
What a time to run out of sugar.
Looks like quite a way.
We'll reach the base of the brain soon.
From there it's not far to the site of the injury.
But we're running out of time.
Where's that light coming from?
It's from the outside world.
Filtering in through Benes's eardrum.
That puts us right here.
Which means we can head for the subarachnoid cavity.
The Proteus has passed the inner ear and is now in the channel leading to the brain.
I thought I'd die when the scissors dropped on the floor.
- It's against my better judgement.
- To wait until it may be too late?
- I've done all I could with the laser!
- All I ask...
I'm only asking him that he test it beforehand.
If it doesn't work, it's beyond my power to fix it.
But if it does, there's no telling how long it'll stand up.
It's a jury rig at best and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it.
That's why I don't want to put extra strain on it by running unnecessary tests!
- Dr Duval, I insist thatyou test the laser.
- I'll do nothing of the sort!
The operation is my responsibility.
I won't do it.
All right. As usual you want ityour own way.
Only this time there's more at stake.
I know what's at stake, Dr Michaels.
Imagine! They're in the human mind.
"Yet all the suns that light the corridors of the universe shine dim before the blazing of a single thought, proclaiming an incandescent glory: the myriad mind of Man. "
Quite poetic, gentlemen.
Let me know when we pass the soul.
The soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend infinity, and the soul which comes from God is infinite.
Yes, but our time isn't.
- If my calculations are correct...
- Doctor, what's that up ahead?
That's it. That's the site of the injury, that dark spot.
- We'd better get prepared.
- There isn't time.
I don't see how you could operate and get out of here before the hour's up.
Captain, head for the removal point.
Removal point? What are you talking about?
We've only six minutes left.
Hold it, skipper.
- What happens if we overstay?
- Once time's up, deminiaturisation begins.
Then, within seconds, this ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the system.
Then white corpuscles will destroy it as they would any other invader.
How long will it take to get from here to the removal point?
- About two minutes.
- That still leaves me four minutes to operate.
All you'll succeed in doing is getting us trapped.
I simply won't hear of it.
Captain, return to the removal point.
All right.
Grant, what are you doing? 
My power's gone.
Dr Duval, get the laser.
I'm in charge. You were instructed to take orders, not to give them.
- The situation has changed.
- Nothing has, so far as my authority goes.
We've got to get out of here now.
It's suicide. 
I'm not going to let him operate.
You're in no condition to make any decision.
You're not going through with this. 
I forbid it.
- I won't allow anyone to leave this ship!
- I'm going to do all I can to save Benes.
Don't you see whatyou've done? You've given him a perfect opportunity to kill Benes.
- I don't believe that.
- Because of all his gibberish about the soul?
Camouflage, that's all that is, to blind the gullible and cover up his real identity.
A fanatic whose only purpose is to kill Benes!
And now you've made it possible.
I've come up against fanatics before and Duval doesn't fit the pattern.
Skipper, I'm going out there to help.
Remember, we need at least two minutes to get out.
How does it look, Doctor?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
Doctor, we've had it.
If I can clear this central nerve, that may be enough.
Captain, there's something wrong with the escape hatch.
- What do you mean?
- Fluid is seeping through. Have a look at it.
Fluid? There shouldn't be any fluid...
Yes, you'll see it underneath the door.
That should do it.
Look!
- It's heading for the nerve!
- I don't understand.
The laser. Let me have the laser!
Give me your widest beam.
Full power.
The ship's finished.
We'll have to get out on our own.
Is there a quick way out?
- What about Dr Michaels?
- White corpuscles!
We've got to get them out.
They'll ingest the ship and everything in it.
Stay here, both of you.
Hold them off if you can.
What happened?
Dr Michaels... went berserk.
- Berserk, nothing!
- Get me out!
Get this on, quick.
If a window blows we'll lose this airlock.
Grant, help! I'm trapped! Help me!
Grant, can't get my...
Can't get my hands out. 
Get me out of here.
My hands are trapped.
I can't move... can't move my hands.
I can't move my hands.
I can't move my hands.
Get me out! Get me out of here!
Get me out!
Come on, it's no use.
- That's the end of the laser.
- You said there was a quick way out.
We could follow the optic nerve to the corner of the eye.
Time's up.
We'll have to take them out immediately.
It means killing Benes. For all we know, they may have completed the operation.
Damn it to hell!
Attention, please.
You will remove the Proteus immediately.
Remove the radar.
Prepare for trephination.
Light impulses. 
On the way to the brain.
We're nearing the eye.
Hold it, Doctor.
What is it?
That blip we're picking up might only be a radioactive particle.
The Proteus may already be destroyed.
- What are you getting at?
- If I were in their place, running out of time,
I'd abandon ship before I grew to dangerous size and use the extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible.
On my own.
Along the optic nerve to the eye.
Wait 30 seconds.
Glass slide, quick.
Open that door, please!

Eight days of loitering
Yes, eight days.
Almost 12 h. -Ooo
I'm starving.
Smell this cheese.
-Wanderful.
Professor! Professor! -Yes?
A phone call for you. -I'm not here.
They've robbed the museum!
What?
What? In the museum?! I'll come at once.
You didn't eat. -You didn't eat again.
See you later. -Yes, adios Lebel.
Will you go out? -Of course.
-But you have a girl.
What if she has someone else? -Impossible!
If she has, that's the end with her.
Would you really hit a woman?
-Listen, my friend. Nobody is worthy of this.
After eight days on the train at 14:40.
You know that. But you know me.
Adios, Lebel. -Adios, Dufourquet.
No-one may enter.
-Agnes de Villermosa is here. -And?
That's all? Yes, I finished. Thank you.
So? -There are no surface wounds.
According to me, it's a heart attack.
The poor man most probably died of fear.
-Sure you agree, Professor, that something here stinks.
He didn't touch the golden crown and the necklace of rubies.
Most probably he's a crazy collectior.
-The statuette is something special.
It's priceless. The civilization that made it has disappeared.
Disappeared? -The Maltek civilization.
-Maltek? And what has this to do with that? -Everything.
And who are the Malteks?
People of the Amazonian rainforest who were destroyed by barbarians. -Barbarians?
Conquistadors, Europe, you, I... -I?
You have been there? In the rainforest?
-Yes, I will show you.
Shot three years ago.
On the day that the expedition ended.
Yes, I see you.
You're here. -No, here.
And the other two? - Villermosa, who died after we returned.
And Di Castro. The Brazilian who financed the expedition.
Each one of you came back with your own doll, stolen and now yours.
Exactly.
-We won't get anywhere that way.
The Malteks were interested in secrets and hypnosis.
Do you know what was their best weapon?
-Swords, spears?
Poison.
That's nonsense.
-What if not all of them disappeared?
Yes, Indians dead for the last 300 years came to Paris only to steal a lousy piece of wood.
With the help of hypnosis. Obvious!
The statuettes are cursed.
I gave mine to the museum; that's why they came here.
Villermosa kept his and died from a poisonous arrow.
Why didn't you tell me, Martin?
-But I did, three years ago.
Agnes, you came. -Of course.
-Whom do I have the honour...
The daughter of Mr. Villermose.
-I didn't know. But of course.
Excuse me, miss.
Do you know where is the statuette of your father?
-We never found it.
Father hid it before he died.
-Ah, I see. Thank you.
I will accompany the lady.
-I'll wait.
Look, I found something. An arrow.
Everyone ridiculed me and told me that the Malteks have died out.
The morons think that I'm mad.
The rainforest swallowed the Malteks, submitted to green oblivion...
It's nice that you dropped by.
You always come if something goes wrong.
Thank you.
I would take such a little girl for a daughter at once.
I'm not a little girl anymore.
You always call me that way.
Only once per half-year.
-Haven't I changed at all?
You've chnaged a lot.
You are more... -Feminine? Ha ha ha
Quite a little different, no?
-Yes, truly.
So?
I still age alone.
How is it with aunt?
-Come for a visit, you'll find out.
Bye!
Why would they kidnap the professor?
-Because of the statuette, of course.
The story repeats itself.
-It interests me, what's with these statuettes.
They haven't found the statuette of Mr. Villermose?
-No. -No, no, no.
After the expedition my borthert, her father, hid the statuette.
After that, poor him...
Dreadful thing, madam.
Adrien! -Free for a whole week.
Did you get the postcard? Well, I'm here.
Greetings, auntie!
Whom do I have the honor...-My pleasure.
Well, until later.
I'll come back in a week.
Don't wait for me. -No.
Not now, the police is here.
Police?
You say that your father hid the statuette. -Yes.
And Agnes knowa where he hid it.
-At that time we lived in Rio...
She was only 14.
-He hid it at the top of the aviary.
An aviary in Brazil? -I remember.
At three in the afternoon everyone was sleeping.
I also went to take a rest when I saw from the window
...how father dug a hole and put the statuette in it.
He wore gloves and was all sweaty.
If we were to go there, I'd find it for sure.
Draw the location, I'll send it to the Brazilian police.
-I don't know exactly.
I would truly have to be there. -Miss, your car obstructs traffic.
My car? Let's see again. We still will see
And really that's the case again. I'll be there right away.
-You forgot about me?
We haven't forgotten about you, young man. Come here.
Whom do I have the plasure...
-Soldier Dufourquet, 3rd squadron.
A pilot, then. You don't look like it. A relative?
-No.
Fiance? -Not yet.
-What are you here for?
Agnes is a friend of mine.
-Oh, is she? -Yes, she is.
What are you saying?
Why did they kidnap the professor?
-The professor? Oh yes!
I'll tell you.
I kidnapped him.
-Listen. We'll be friends if you don't make fun.
-Do you want details?
I stood at the window, the night was coming down, when two sinister men in black stepped out of the car.
They walked slowly towards the professor, reached him and kidnapped him.
They kidnapped her!
Stop him!
Your ticket, please. -I must stop...
-You can get a ticket from the machine.
From the machine, please.
Get in line, like everyone else.
Agnes!
Thank you, sir.
General, general? Should I bring you a newspaper?
Yes, please, miss.
You didn't bring one miss?
Still, you are charming.
At your orders, general. -At rest!
Like Charlesroi!
Sir, your boarding pass. You have to go there.
Agnes!
-You have to go there.
All passengers embarked.
Listen...-Sit down, sir.
-Listen to me me, please.
Please... -Buckle yourself. I will help you.
Dear passengers, you are on the plane to Rio de Janeiro.
Rio!
Can I help? -No.
-What do you need? -No.
You seat... -It is here.
If Lebel could hear this!
Sir?
-I have to talk to the capitan.
We may not distrub him. -The matter is serious.
The have kidnapped this girl. -Which one?
The one who sits between two men.
-Wait, please.
You passports, please. Thank you.
Thank you.
That's what the mister says. -Do you know him?
No. -Agnes, after everything...
Return to your seat. We do not want any problems.
-But Agnes...
I will notify the police in Rio.
They will put things in order.
I can explain...
Could you hold for a moment to check your passport?
Welcome to Rio.
Do you speak English? -No.
-French? -No.
Italian? -No.
-Only Portuguese? -Yes, yes. -Forget it.
This is Rio.
Americano? Liz Taylor, Cadilaci,
Hollywood, Cape Canaveral.
I know all America.
Polish it well. And the other one.
Francaise? Tour Eiffel, de Gaule,
Brigitte Bardot... I know.
Five cruzeiros.
I don't have any.
Go your way.
Fifty.
Here. -Thanks
What am I doing here?
What is your name?
-Sir Winston. -What?
Sir Winston.
-Hi Sir Winston.
Where are you going?
-I'm looking for a girl. -Girls!
I know where. Let's go.
No, my girl Agnes.
-Agnes? Is she pretty?
Lost in Rio. They kidnapped her and I don't know where she is.
Wait.
Here, here!
What's wrong?
Call the ambulance.
What is wrong with you?
Excuse me, it is mine.
-Yes, yes.
If you please, I'd like it back. Give it back to me. It's mine!
-Right away!
What did you see? -Let's go.
Miss Villermosa. -She isn't here.
A French woman, she came with two local losers.
Tell me only the number of her room.
I may not tell you this.
-Right, I'll find it out on my own.
If you insist, sir, we'll have to kick you out.
Don't worry, I'll still find her.
Dear! -What?
Don't you remember me? -No.
So you kow Pickwick?
Of course I know this old saber. After you, madam.
I'm glad that you like him.
-Yes, yes.
It is very kind of you. -No problem.
Pickwick, now we'll have our nice afternoon cup of tea.
What would he do without his tea.
You know how chidren are. -Yes.
We'll be delighted to see you again. Oh, thank you.
Goodbye, goodbye. -I hope to see you soon.
-Goodbye, goodbye.
Agnes, do you hear me? Wake up.
What have they done to you?
Wake up! -What do you want? - Let's go, do you hear?
-Stop shaking me!
These hogs drugged her.
Look at me, Agnes.
Get up.
Smile, walk.
Agnes, go to the door and don't stop.
Where is she? Where are you going?
Walk.
Goodbye. -Let's go
Did you get the gang?
Wake up.
Wake up!
These lousy hogs, hogs!
How pleasant.
And this looks like waves.
Agnes!
Of course these are waves.
And this is a sea.
Because we are in Rio. -Rio?
Yes, Rio de Janeiro. Brazil.
Do you understand? -Brazil! Brazil.
Stop! -Some man.
Don't you remember me? -No. I don't care who, forget it.
Get yourself together. -You look handsome.
Something like this never happens.
She doesn't know me anymore.
-What a nice surprise.
Pleasant music, no-one on the beach.
Thank you, handsome. -Stop it already.
These hogs!
What does he say?
We shouldn't sleep on the beach, we must go.
I'm sleepy.
We go to my house.
Come, sweetheart!
You live here? -Yes. Come!
She is beautiful! -Believe me, she's heavy.
Bring me pink sheets.
-Do you hear her?
She always wants what I don't have.
If I say something it's like talking to the wall.
She doesn't listen at all.
Woman means that she waits for you at home.
The woman is tender, understanding.
When you come home in the evening, you see her in the living room playing the piano. Or the harp.
Love at home for whom has it.
This water still doesn't know how to boil.
I'm chasing her around the world.
Is this normal? -I know. Scotch?
Chin, chin!
Where am I? Adrien!
What are you doing here?
Where am I? Agnes!
A, Agnes. Everything is alright.
Finally you are back to yourself. Look.
What is this? How beautiful.
-Rio.
Rio? -Quite simply:
Yesterday at 16h I arrived with Lebel to Pariz.
I went to your place... -Dreadful!
Wonderful. -What will it be? Dreadful or wonderful?
-The icecream is wonderful, what happened is dreadful.
You are nailed. -Better stop this.
Do you think that I'm having fun?
They can shoot me for this.
You and your statuettes, Indian barbars, and profesor Batactan...
Catalan. Don't mix the poor man into this.
-Alright, why did they kidnap him.
And you... -They couldn't dare?
-Don't get upset.
There's more reasons to kidnap me.
Only I know where the statuette is hidden.
You aren't still clear?
-So?
I plan to tell them where the statuette is. They made a mistake.
Where are you going? -Come, come!
Where? -Just come along.
We lived here with father.
You don't like it.
-Yes, yes, beautiful. -Look!
The dog house.
What a sweetheart he was.
His name was Pilou.
Bernard, with a blind eye.
The chambermaid broke it with the broom. -Beautiful...
How beautiful. -You didn't come to look around.
-You're right. Wait here.
I stood here when father came from the house.
Go to the end of the garden.
Furhter back. Go, go...
To the left.
You're clumsy.
Where are you? I don't see you.
-Here. -Further back.
Quickly, quickly!
Straight. Go already! Stay.
That's good. I remember that he stood heretukaj je stal.
Where is the aviary?
-This all is an aviary.
At the time there weren't so many plants.
-This is life: from seed to plant.
Give me the shovel.
No, no, no, no.
Yes.
-Shovel.
Come on, I'm waiting!
Isn't it wonderful?
Run.
You asked for it!
Adrien! Help me!
Adrien, save me!
The statuette!
What's the problem? -I'm warning you, don't point a gun at me.
Are you crazy? We need it.
-Adrien, what did I tell you? - I'm going.
Why do the bad guys always win?
-They still don't know with whom they play.
There's a surprise waiting for them.
Where did they go? -You know
I may not tell you this.
Where did they go?
-I don't know, miss.
They have two statuettes. There's one left.
-Di Castro's.
Is he from Rio?
-Yes, I think.
Most probably he's in the phone directory.
How do you spell it? -The way you pronounce it.
-As a member of the expedition he's next.
But I won't allow this.
-Stop talking and search. -Aha, di Castro.
Mr. di Castro is on the ship.
There he is. -Slowly.
-We must be fast, we have to warn him.
-We have to get such a boat.
What if we are already too late?
What if they already killed him, stabbed him?
The ship is his grave on the water.
I'm have fears. -You're right, let's go.
To hell! Only your mouth works.
-Watch your language.
You're right, I'll go alone.
Wait! Did you get crazy?
You'll attract attention.
-I'm not afraid of the water.
Did you learn to swim?
-No, why? -I will go.
Don't worry. Only don't move until I come back.
I'll be back right away. -Ah so!
I'm not good enough anymore.
Is there anyone here?
Hands up.
-I will explain...
Towards the shore, darling.
I gave up my motherland, family, army and friends, crossed the ocean, so that I could see miss Agnes, to kick the nosy potlids.
Is this normal?
Adrien, try it, it's not difficult. -I'd rather die.
You dared a lot to leave me alone.
Did you find di Castro?
No. -Wasn't he on the ship?
-No.
Is there something wrong? -No.
-You're angry, aren't you?
You have Rio at your feet.
You can manage alone quite well.
This is for you. Bye, darling.
In 4 days I have an appointment with Lebel at the station under the clock. It was nice.
If I start something, I finish it.
The statuette! -Mr. di Castro.
-You know him?
I know him.
-Where is he?
He went by plane? Where?
-To Brasilia.
Adrien, did you hear? He's in Brasilia.
We can still catch him.
Why not? It's not far, we'll get the subway. Do you have a ticket? Here.
Smell it.
If you loved me, you wouldn't make fun.
-I still haven't proven my love to you?
Words don't prove anything.
How far is Brasilia?
-Thousand, two thousand kilometers.
We'll need a car.
-I know. -Exactly!
You have to choose the color. -Pink with small green stars.
Look at this little house! Butterflies!
What is this? Look.
-Pole. -No, that.
Telegraph pole.
For all this you see poles.
-Leave me alone.
You are ridiculous. How could you be insensitive to the beauty of the world?
Listen! A deserter in a stolen car with a hyterical woman is a moron or a drug addict, but is not insensitive. So what am I?
Let's go. -If I want to.
-I'll get out? -If you want to.
You always achive what you want.
Pull!
-That's what I'm doing.
Where does it lock? -Find it out.
-Why should I be doing everything?
Pay attention! Don't let it lose!
-But I hold it!
Get up, what are you doing?
-Yes, sergeant. At once, sergeant.
On the floor! On your feet!
On the floor! On your feet!
How sweet you are in your underwear. Angry?
Answer me!
Come back!
This is the police.
Sir, could you, please, arrest me?
I deserted, lost my uniform and flew with the stolen ticket of some invalid.
I fought with men of all colors and nations, and I drive around in a stolen pink car with little green stars.
I'm also guilty of public indecency.
Sir, the handcuffs! Please.
Soldier Dufourquet, third squadron.
French airforce. Do you understand?
No, eh?
Only Rio and Brasilia.
Ah, Brasilia? 50 km. -Too bad that I don't smuggle something.
Look! -Yes, I know. Butterflies with ears.
Stop, the green car. It's the professor.
Stop, it's Catalan!
Who, Catalan? -The professor is alive.
We must save him.
Let's do it!
Hold the steering wheel.
No! No! No!
Quickly, so you don't end up there.
Professor!
-You'll hug him afterwards.
Let's go, fast! Step on the gas.
Agnes! How come you are here?
They kidnapped me, and Adrien , my fiance, saved me.
He has a leave. -Keep your eyes on the road!
-Thank you very much, sir.
Don't mention it.
-What have they done to you?
First they kidnapped me.
-And we meet on the road to Brasilia.
Where are we going? -To warn di Castro.
-To warn?
Indeed!
We must warn him before they get him.
I was afraid that they had killed you. -No, no.
Only I know the secret of the statuettes.
Secret! I haven't come to play cowboys and Indians.
I still have three days of leave left.
-Don't think only about yourself!
Everywhere there'll be windows, everywhere only glass.
So that it will be bright, full of glare and transparent light.
Like a butterfly wing.
Such shall be the building.
I insist.
Let's go!
Norbert!
Let's go to my place for a glass.
We'll talk there.
This is my hiding place.
Not at all.
Ah, my fountains. Not really from Versailles, but still cool. I hate these plants.
We'll throw them out!
No, no, no!
There won't be such crashings in my house.
Go!
The statuette is safe.
This is the jewel in my collection, my most precious memory.
My youth.
And you? Still single?
You still wear a suit too small?
Do you like the new Brasilia?
-Very much. -And Brasilians?
How strong it is!
-I know her since she had diapers.
Everything grows: the world grows and shoots sprouts, that grow like my city.
This was wilderness three years ago.
Then some of us got together and this is what happened.
-You are wonderful!
Only you haven't changed, Norbert.
I followed your work about the Malteks. Wonderful.
You are still such a dreamer, no? -You don't believe me?
-I'm a busy man and I don't have time for daydreams.
I joked. But you aren't... -A loser?
Come on. You are wonderful!
-The statuette, Mario.
We shouldn't bore the guests.
-They won't mind at all.
Would you like to see the statuette?
Here it is!
Imitation. -Bravo!
The eyes of an expert.
It's fake.
I have a few of these, the real one is hidden. -Where?
-Did you think in the living room?
Where so many people pass by?
-Good. And me?
Is there a problem? -Our friend is in an unusual situation.
He must be in Paris on Monday.
-Come, you have my word.
I will arrange everything.
Tonight there will be a hydroplane available to Mr. Catalan. -Tonight?!
Correct, in the morning before daybreak.
Tonight you are my guests. -My leave...
-That's unimportant. I know that you are reasonable.
I'll introduce to you my wife. Norma!
Friends from France.
We'll quickly prepare something and have entertainment.
That's you!
-Unbeatable.
They call me so because I always win.
Cheers. Agnes, your eyes spill out.
-Spill out? -Full with anger and promises. -Truly?
-Your eyes are whispering, murmuring.
Stop throbbing!
I hate noise.
Where did we stop?
-My eyes are spilling out.
You are frightening me.
-I hope, dear.
I took off.
The flames from the ship were high.
Suddenly I notice that I burn.
And I'm 5km above ground.
It was just for laughter.
What is so funny?
-He lies.
Before the flight to Rio he still hadn't been in mid air. -Just a second, girls.
Just a second, girls.
You're witty.
-Don't neglect me.
Be glad for what I still do for you?
-I'm not joking.
I think that I love you. -There's really nowhere still some dragon which I have to kill for you?
It's over with the dragons. -Whom do I shoot?
Save? I can retire.
The slippers, mom!
-This will come. Kiss me.
Only if you'll be happy.
Mario, show me the statuette.
-My friend, drink a bit.
You didn't drink at all. -No.
Are you afraid that you'll be poisoned?
Like the father of Agnes.
-Why are you saying this? -You're nervous.
This is expected after all that happened. -Is the statuette truly safe?
Sure. -I'd like to see it.
-You're joking.
You're right that you want reassurance.
As long as I guard it, it's not in any danger.
Trust me.
Come.
Come on, come.
Behind you.
Do you still believe in Maltek's treasure?
-More than anyone else.
And the answer is in the three statuettes?
-As if you didn't know.
Enter.
Wonderful. -We keep here the best pieces. My treasures.
And the statuette?
So?
Yes.
I waited three years for this.
Three years of preparations.
You make fun of me that I wear a suit too small.
But this loser will soon be richer than you.
Wait below.
We lead! -You try.
-Are you having fun?
Where were you?
-Here, Agnes.
Where is di Castro?
-He retreated because he is tired.
I already said goodbye so that we can go.
No, as long as we're winning.
I missed!
Forget about this stupid game.
I have to tell you something.
20 points. -I tell you for the last time.
-I'll throw one more time, and then we'll go.
I promise.
It hurts! -My patience has a limit.
You won't make of me as with your own foolish lovers.
-Nobody complained. -How unfortunate!
You won't make a scene.
-It's your turn, Agnes.
I'll do it.
Agnes!
Wait, Adrien calls.
You boor, let me be!
Adrien!
Agnes, don't worry! I'm coming!
A call for you. Mother is calling.
Calmly, don't panic.
What's written in the book?
Pull the control lever.
Slowly.
Slowly, slowly.
Agnes!
Everywhere there's only water.
Man would need a ponton.
I'll jump.
No, that's not for me.
I thought it over.
Now!
I got him, the devil!
Also a Frenchman? It's a small world.
Where from?
Besancon. -And they say that we stay only at home.
Where are we going?
-We're going to drink.
More? -Yes.
You'll like it here. They have everything: girls, drinks and music.
Paradise, my friend.
True paradise.
Where are these two going?
-The gorillas? -Yes.
They go to Loli, like everyone.
Come, I'll show you.
Do you like her?
This is Lola.
In this golden throat there's a hidden character. The girl directs the town.
She has a business head.
Drink.
Listen.
Calm down, drink something.
Good luck comes your way.
-With your help.
Help is worthy of gold.
-He's very effective, right?
I know how to choose men.
-The boat is wonderful.
Give me money for the crew.
Your fairy tale is very expensive to me.
-A few more days and I'll repay you a thousand times.
I don't believe you any more.
This I make for you.
These statuettes are the key to the sectret.
And only I discovered it.
Look.
One...
Two...
Three.
The key is in the light.
Listen:
At the source of the river, the sun melts the rocks.

And when you enter the holy pit, the dead light will become alive.
Diamondes, tons of diamonds.
The famous treasure of the Malteks.
Of course.
-Which you still don't believe?
I know what it will be when you find the stones.
-I'll give you a half. -And Agnes?
What is she doing here? -Quiet!
-First you kill her father, and then you show up with her.
-Only she knew where the statuette was.
You needed her in Rio, not here.
-Enough! Don't monetion her any more.
Never!
-Alright, alright.
He's here?
-What's wrong?
Some Parisian followed us.
-I'll arrange it.
Is there anybody from Paris here?
-Me!
You, right?
-Yes, madam.
It's me.
-Come on, Chita!
You hog!
You from the right, me from the left.
Hey, Manuel!
Do you help me? Thanks.
Don't leave me alone!
Agnes!
You are a monster!
Do you truly believe in this?
What do you think?
I'm enchanted!
After the discovery my work became appreciated, it's fascinating!
I neede a lot of time.
You don't believe me about the secret and you don't see these beauties.
Besides, you're still in love with this poor Adrien.
Forget him.
Come with me!
Together we'll become right and enjoy glory!
I had to use force, it came to that.
What should I do with you?
Could you tell me?
I don't know.
Think about my proposal.
See you tomorrow.
Adrien!
I love you.
And you me?
What me?
We are going to the spring with the boat.
Two come with me, the others not.
That's it. No doubt, we arrived.
Wait. -I can't anymore.
-A few more minutes and the this will be the end of my effort.
Here!
Agnes!
Adrien, help!
Where is Catalan?
Agnes!
Quickly!
Do they still shoot deserters?
-Because I still have two days.
More than enough.
Have you seen Lebel? -No.
-He'll be also late.
Go, run! Jump!
Look, what... -Only how I was running!
Wait to catch my breath.
I brought you something. -Nice.
Who would know what I went through.
What happened?
-I walked three hours, three hours!
Where from? -From home.
I crossed the whole of Paris.
A whole adventure.
Our hero grew apace.
A country lad, far happier in the woods than in the study.
A bad hero, it may be, with many a weakness.
But then, if Adam hadn't had such a weakness for apples, there would be nobody to tell Tom's story at all.
And a part of that story tells of the sport Tom found in the woods.
Ah, Tom.
You wicked dog.
Molly. What are you doing here?
I 'eard Father tell Mother you was coming.
It's a good night to be abroad and looking for game.
Ah, Tom...
Oh, Tom...
It shall be our custom to leave such scenes where taste, decorum and the censor dictate.
In this way, we shall try to make up for our incorrigible hero.
As soon as he had left the disreputable Molly, what did he do but join her equally disreputable father, Black George, gamekeeper to Squire Allworthy.
- Come on!
- I hear 'em. Psst.
Come on, lads. We'll smoke 'em out.
Fetch it. Fetch it, boy. Come on.
Wait. That's fallen on Squire Western's ground.
Well, let's after it.
No - I've been warned for trespassing.
It's our bird. Don't worry, Blackie.
- Come back! Come...
- Here, boy. Here, boy. Here, boy.
All right, you devils, I'll get you!
- I'll have your blood! I'll...
- Run, Blackie!
Let's give the old man a run for his money.
Home, lads. I'll get 'em another night.
- I thought I'd lost you in the woods.
- Short cut.
- We'll be caught one of these days.
- Don't worry.
It's all right for you - you haven't got a family to keep.
I'll look after you.
Here... Take this guinea.
Good night, Blackie.
Our hero, alas, was always being exploited by villains like Black George.
For a generous man is merely a fool in the eyes of a thief.
- A sheep?
- Aye, sir, an entire sheep.
A fat animal. Enough to feed a village for a week.
Hanging up in his cottage as proud as a battle trophy.
- This is a grave matter.
- A hanging matter.
- Sir, if I may speak on his behalf, I'd...
- Be silent.
Are you guilty?
I am... guilty...
- Sir, forgive him.
- Be quiet, sir. I have to do justice here.
You have committed a capital crime.
The laws have provided the most terrible penalty: To hang by your neck.
But you have children.
For their sake, I shall only dismiss you from my service.
And may God have mercy on you.
You're too lenient, Mr Allworthy.
Compassion is one thing, sir, but justice is another.
Mr Thwackum and Mr Square were Tom's tutors.
Over the years, they tried - with little success - to thrash into Tom a sense of virtue and religion.
They had, however, a more apt pupil.
Soon after Tom had been found, the squire's sister Bridget married a Captain Blifil, and they had a son.
This young man was quite different from Tom.
He was sober, discreet and pious beyond his age, and the whole neighbourhood resounded in his praise.
You have only taught Tom to laugh at whatever is decent and virtuous and right.
- I've taught him religion.
- Mr Thwackum, the word "religion" is as vague and uncertain as any in the English language.
By "religion" I mean the Christian religion.
Not only that, but the Protestant religion.
And not only that, but the Church of England.
I fear that Tom is the embodiment of the old truth that foundlings should be left to the parish.
My dear tutors, I'm afraid neither of you can touch his bastard's heart.
Neither indeed.
But there was another who could.
Tom...
- I want you to help me.
- How?
I want you to get me a post, Tom.
Mm-hm...
Miss Western's come back from France and'll be wantin' a maid.
I'll speak to her.
Tom, you are kind to me.
Miss Western's maid!
Sophie Western! Miss Western!
Why, Tom Jones!
I've brought you a thrush.
He's beautiful, Tom. How kind of you.
Two years is a long time. Did they teach you London ways, make a lady of you?
Most of the time I was in France.
My aunt took me there.
- Did you like France, Meez Western?
- Mais oui. Je me suis tres bien amusee.
- Ah, bon.
- You haven't changed, Tom.
You've grown, Sophie.
Grown more beautiful than ever.
Doesn't he sing beautifully?
I shall teach him some new songs.
I doubt if an English bird can learn French songs.
You'll see.
Avignon
Sur le pont d'Avignon...
We're asked to supper. I came early to ask if you'd help Black George's daughter.
Oh, yes. He stole a sheep, didn't he?
Black George is a poor man.
With big, hungry daughters to feed.
Most hungry - I can vouch for it.
I have a maid already.
But I'll see what I can do.
Good, good.
Ah! Welcome, neighbours! Welcome!
- How nice to see you.
- Welcome, madam. Welcome, Squire.
Good day, Western, good day.
- Look! Tom brought me a thrush!
- What a sweet little bird!
His song is sweeter than any tune of Mr Handel's.
Ugh, Handel!
Tom, thank you.
Welcome home, Sophie.
How lovely you're looking, child.
Aye, it's good to have her home.
Let's all go in to dinner.
- Oh dear.
- Oh, my little bird!
Don't worry, Sophie,
I'll get it back for you.
- Tom...
- Good lad, Tom.
Be careful, Tom! Tom, take care!
- I'll wager he gets it.
- Take care.
I am sorry to cause you this distress,
Miss Western.
I did not think the bird would fly away.
But I cannot help observing that the idea of caged birds is against the laws of nature.
Don't you agree, Mr Square?
He's got him!
Argh!
He'll drown! Quick, pick him up!
Help him, someone!
- Oh, Tom, you're soaked!
- Come on, lad, give me your hand.
Damn me if I won't love the boy for this as long as I have to live!
Serves him right.
And you, sir.
The weeks passed... and Molly grew apace too.
Ah, you lazy slut, you!
Look at her, with that great belly on her!
That I should have lived to see this day!
You'd better have minded what the parson said and not harkened after menfolks.
She's the first of this family to be a whore!
Mother, you yourself was brought to bed with sister there a week after you married.
Ah, but I were made an honest woman of.
But you, you have to be doing with gentlemen, don't you, you nasty slut, you!
You will have a bastard!
And I defy anybody to say that of me.
- My gentlemen'll look after me.
- Your gentlemen! Far from gentlemen!
You lay off me, or I'll tell my gentlemen...
...if these be constantly applied,
And then, though we cannot absolutely promise success, yet we may properly say with the apostle
"What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?"
And now, my dear brethren, let us sing together the hymn
"O God, Our Help in Ages Past."
O God, our help in ages past
Our hope for years to come...
"Let dogs delight to bark and bite,
For God hath made them so."
"Let bears and lions growl and fight,
For 'tis their nature too."
"But, ladies, you should never let
Such angry passions rise."
"Your little hands were never made
To tear each other's eyes."
There she is! Let's get at her!
Let's thrash her!
Don't want the likes of her in this village!
Won't have her mixing with us good folk!
Take that, you hussy!
I'll get you, Goody Brown, you dirty old harridan!
Oh, Tom... Please, Tom...
Don't... Don't leave me, Tom.
Slowly. Slowly.
That filthy slut.
Ah, good boy, good boy!
He's a game lad, your Tom.
So, the wench is having a bastard?
Yes. It seems the girl has refused to name the father to Mr Allworthy.
He may have to send her to Bridewell.
- Father, I have a headache.
- I smoke it.
I smoke it!
Tom is the father of that bastard!
Aye! As sure as tuppence,
Tom is the bastard's father!
Father...
Odds zodikins!
What a little whoremaster that boy is!
The girl is ruined, surely.
Aye! Ruined. Ruined for sure!
Once broken, never mended, eh?
Lt'll do no harm. Ask Sophie.
She knows about Tom.
You have no worse opinion of a young fellow for getting a bastard, have you?
Will you stop bobbing up and down, girl!
No, no. The women will like him the better for it, won't they?
- Sophie, sing us one of your jolly songs.
- Not tonight, Father. I have a headache.
Let's have "St George, He Was for England" or "Bobbing Joan".
That's a good song for tonight, eh?
None of your old Handel now, my little darling.
Ah, you play like an angel.
Molly's reputation was destroyed, and Tom's heart was heavy with remorse.
Perhaps Mr Square had been right, that the wicked are snared in the work of their own hands.
Oh. Mr Jones.
- Where's Molly?
- Oh, she... she ain't home.
She's upstairs. In bed.
- Who is it?
- It's me. Tom.
Why haven't you been to see me before this, Tom?
- Molly, I...
- Agh!
- You said you'd be my gentleman!
- I hope to explain why...
You'll not admit you've had your wicked will of me?!
- Molly...
- No.
I shall never love another man but you, Tom.
Not if the greatest squire in the country came a-courtin',
I couldn't give myself to him!
No, Tom, not for all the riches in the world, now that you've gained my heart.
You are a lecherous rascal after all, Tom!
I shall always hate and despise the whole sex on account of you, Tom!
Mr Square.
Molly's favours, after all, had not been bestowed on Tom alone.
Our hero, unlike many other men, was fortunate enough to discover the father of his child in time.
And after everyone's kindness, too.
She has laid the child at young Mr Jones's door.
All the parish say Mr Allworthy is so angry with Mr Jones that he won't see him.
To be sure, one can't help pitying the poor young man.
He's so pretty a gentleman. I should be sorry to see him turned out-of-doors.
Why do you tell me all this? What concern have I in what Mr Jones does?
Why, ma'am, I never thought it was any harm to say a young man was handsome.
But I shall never think of him any more now. For handsome is as handsome does.
Tittle-tattle, tittle-tattle.
I shall be late for the hunt.
Sorry, I'm sure, madam.
Everyone in my household!
Where's the cider?
Greetings! Greetings!
- Greetings, Thwackum.
- Morning, Squire. Morning, Miss Western.
Welcome, everyone.
Morning, Western.
Oh, you brute!
- Morning.
- And you, sir.
Ah, you're getting no younger.
I mean the horse, madam.
A stirrup cup, everyone!
Come, help yourselves, everyone!
Plenty to eat and drink!
Here. The Church is always first with the bread and wine.
Health to everyone!
French miss isn't speaking today?
Drink up, everyone.
- Huntsmen, loose the hounds.
- Another tankard, please.
Come on, boys and girls!
Come on, come on!
Have a drop of cider inside you, boy.
Then you'll be ready for the kill.
Come on, drink up. Drink up, everyone.
Come on, drink up!
Some Western brew for you, my girl!
Squire, it's too early! You'll tire yourself!
Quiet, everyone.
Good health and good hunting!
Come on, Sophie! Hurry, hurry!
Come on, sweetheart! After him!
Tally-ho!
Ahhh! Here he is!
- I trust you're not harmed.
- No, no. How can I ever thank you?
If I have preserved you, madam,
I am sufficiently repaid. Agh...
I hope you're not hurt.
If I have broken my arm, it is a trifle compared to my fears on your account.
Broken your arm?!
I'm afraid I have, madam.
Yet I have another to lead you home.
Look at him, ma'am. He's the most handsome man I ever saw in my life.
Why, Honor, I do believe you're in love with him.
I assure you, ma'am, I'm not.
If you were, I see no reason that you should be ashamed of it.
For he is certainly a handsome fellow.
That he is - the most handsome man
I ever saw in my life.
And, as you say, ma'am, I don't know why
I should be ashamed of looking at him, even though he is my better.
For gentlefolk are but flesh and blood, like us servants.
I am an honest person's child, and my mother and father were married - which is more than some people can say.
Honor!
My grandfather was a clergyman, and he'd have been very angry to have thought any of his family had taken up with Molly Seagrim's leavings.
Why, ma'am, the young gentleman is awake.
Yes. You've awakened him with your foolish chatter.
I feel awake for the first time, madam.
"...after narrow scru... narrow scrutiny, found some magical books..." Ha-haar!
"...several vials of strange liquors, pots of ointment..."
Remember that picnic, Sister, last year, when Western sat on a wasps' nest?
I shall never forget it!
Oh, it's so beautiful this summer.
Brother... Brother...
- Brother!
- Whoa! Whoa!
- I can't...
- It's all right. It's all right.
Why the long face, Blif?
- Such a terrible thing.
- What's happened?
There's been an accident.
My mother is dead.
Blif...
And Squire Allworthy?
He's not expected to live.
Shh.
Fever has developed and there is little hope. We can only pray.
Something for which you have scant relish!
"Forasmuch as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear sister here departed, we therefore commit her body to the ground, earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen."
Well, there's another one gone.
So sorry.
Cheer up, lad.
She will be with the angels, my boy.
Our mortal forms are but shadows of a purer reality.
- Thank you for your comforting words.
- She was a great lady.
Sir, some time before your mother died she gave me a letter.
Her instructions were to hand it to Mr Allworthy as she was buried.
I will give it to my uncle.
She expressly said into no hands but Mr Allworthy's.
Lawyer Dowling, if my uncle lives he will need a new steward.
I intend to recommend you.
You are most kind, sir.
Do not grieve, my dear nephew.
Do not grieve.
Sir, you cannot die.
Death comes to us all, Tom.
I have asked you here to tell you of my will.
Nephew Blifil, I leave you heir to my whole estate, with these exceptions.
To you, my dear Tom,
I have given an estate of $800 a year, together with $1,000 in ready money.
I am convinced, my boy, that you have much goodness, generosity and honour in your nature.
If you will add prudence and religion to these, you must be happy.
$1,000 I leave to you, Mr Thwackum, and a like sum to you, Mr Square - which I am convinced exceeds your desires as well as your wants.
As for my servants, for Marjorie and Jane, $100 each.
"...my soul shall praise the Lord even to death, and my life was drawing near to hell beneath..."
Mr Allworthy's recovered!
It's over! The fever's gone!
He's sitting up! He's well again!
The squire's recovered!
It's over!
It is not true that drink changes a man's character.
It can reveal it more clearly.
The Squire's recovery brought joy to Tom, to his tutors sheer disappointment.
Sing, thick Thwackum, your bounty's flown...
You have good reason for your drunkenness, you beggarly bastard!
- He's provided well enough for you!
- Do you think that could weigh with me?
- Damn you, Thwackum!
- How dare you, sir?!
And damn me if I don't open another bottle.
I shall sing you a ballad, entitled "Sing, thick Thwackum, thy bounty has flown".
Sing, thick Thwackum, thy bounty's flown
You've lost all the money you thought that you'd own...
Mr Jones!
This house is in mourning on account of the death of my dear mother.
Oh, sir, forgive me.
The joy of Mr Allworthy's recovery...
I had the misfortune to know who my parents were.
Consequently, I'm grieved by their loss.
You rascal. Do you dare to insult me?
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
This behaviour is most unseemly.
Oh, Master Blifil!
Oh, that vulgar animal! Out with him!
All right, we'll go outside!
Let's have some wine!
Get him out! Get him out!
How dare you throw me out?
Shall we take the evening air?
It is widely held that too much wine will dull a man's desire.
Indeed it will - in a dull man.
Sophia...
Sophie...
I'll carve her name on this tree!
Tree, do you mind if I carve the name of my Sophia?
Big S for Sophia... Sophie...
Sophie, Sophia...
So... Molly...
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly...
M for Molly...
Are you aimin' to slit my throat, Squire?
Would you like... a sip of my wine?
Mm.
I never had a sip of a gentleman's wine before.
Oh, it's very potent!
What are you laughin' at, Tom?
I'm thinking of Square in your bedroom!
To those who find our hero's behaviour startling, the answer is simple:
Tom had always thought that any woman was better than none, while Molly never felt that one man was quite as good as two.
- He has a wench!
- A wench?
- Let's go and find the wicked girl.
- Yes!
Who's that?
- How dare you?!
- Thwacky! Ha-ha!
Mr Jones, control yourself!
How disgraceful!
Go away, sir! Go away, sir!
Take that, you wicked fool!
You there! Damnation to you!
Stop it! Stop! What's the matter with you?
Damnation to you! Get over there!
Whoa, there! Three falling onto one?
Whoa! The whip!
Come, lass, see to Tom.
He's in a devilish pickle, I promise you.
Tom... Shh. Poor Tom. Shh.
- Sophie, dear...
- Shh. I'll fetch some water.
- What are you brawling about, Tom?
- If you search the bushes you'll find out.
You lickerish dog, you!
Where is she? Where's Tom's pussy?
Puss, puss, puss, puss...
Where's Tom's pussy? Puss, puss, puss...
Sophie, I...
Come. After him.
- Sophie!
- Tom. Tom! Come and sup with me.
Gentlemen, let us make our peace over a bottle.
Sir, it is no slight matter for a man of my character to be buffeted by a boy just for trying to bring a wanton harlot to justice!
The fault lies with Mr Allworthy and yourself, sir.
If you would put the right laws into execution, you would soon rid the country of these... vermin.
Ha! I'd sooner rid the country of foxes!
Come, you sup with me. Damn me if there's nothing I wouldn't give you - except my hounds and my favourite mare, Miss Slouch.
Up...
Away, Miss Slouch!
Let us tell Mr Allworthy how the monster has behaved!
No, sirs, I beg of you, let us wait.
A better time will come.
Odds zodikins, it's me sister's coach.
What brings her from London?
I hope the old bitch has gone to bed.
Come, Sophie, sing us one of your jolly songs, my girl.
Father, I do not feel well.
I think I shall go to bed.
Not before you attend to your guest.
Tom here has a great thirst, I warrant you.
Western? What are these nocturnal riots?
- Now lookie here, Sister...
- Sophie?
- Yes, Aunt?
- To bed.
- Bed?
- Bed!
I'd be glad to, madam.
Now lookie here, Sister!
Brother, as I am here to stay a while,
I shall sign a peace treaty with you.
Sister, I've often warned you not to talk that court gibberish to me.
I pity your country ignorance from my heart.
And I despise your citified claptrap!
I'd rather be anything than a courtier, or a... or a Presbyterian, or a crawler around one of those damned German kings, as I believe some people are.
If you mean me, I'm a woman of...
Yes, and a good thing for you that you are.
If you were a man, I'd have lent you a flick long ago!
Brother, I think you are a perfect goat.
Good night, sir.
Good night, Sister.
Brother!
Brother!
Brother!
Oh, stop!
Brother!
Brother, have you not noticed something very extraordinary about Sophie lately?
Tell me, then. You know I love that girl more than my own soul.
Well, unless I am deceived, my niece is desperately in love.
In love?
In love?! Without my consent?!
I'll disinherit her!
I'll cast her out-of-doors stark naked without a farthing!
Where is she?
Supposing she should have fixed on the very person you would have wished?
No. No! She can love whom she pleases, but she'll marry the man I choose!
But she has fixed on the very person you would have wished!
- What?
- What think you of Mr Blifil?
- Young Blifil?
- Well, who else could there be?
In this rude country and society.
Who else is of her class?
'Fore George...
Nothing could lie handier together than Allworthy's estates and mine.
Come, Sister.
What do you advise me to do?
I think you should propose the match to Mr Allworthy... immediately.
I will propose it.
Saddle my horse!
Well, Nephew, how do you feel about this marriage between you and Miss Western?
- I will do exactly as you wish, Uncle.
- Oh, come, sir.
That is a cold answer when confronted by the prospect of so beautiful a young lady.
My dear Uncle,
I am well aware of the many pleasures of that noble institution, marriage, and I will gladly call upon the young lady at any time she will receive me.
Good. You shall call upon her this very afternoon.
Sophie, dear, what book is that you're reading?
A sad one.
- You blush, my dear Sophie.
- I have no thoughts to be ashamed of.
Now, Sophie, you know how I love you.
You know the easiness of my nature.
I have not always been like this.
I used to be thought cruel - by the men, I mean.
I was called "the cruel Parthenissa".
Now come.
I have news that will delight you.
What news, Aunt?
This very afternoon your father has arranged for you to receive your lover.
My lover?
He's coming?! This afternoon?!
Yes. And you're to put on all your best airs.
Why, Aunt!
You almost frighten me out of my senses!
You will come to yourself again.
He's a charming young fellow.
Dear, dear Aunt... I know none of such perfections.
So brave, and yet so gentle.
So handsome.
What matters his being baseborn?
Baseborn? What do you mean?
- Mr Blifil, baseborn?
- Mr Blifil?
Mr Blifil. Of whom else have we been talking?
- Why, Mr Jones!
- Mr Jones?!
Mr Blifil?! You can't be in earnest!
Oh, then I am the most unhappy woman alive.
How can you think of disgracing your family by allying yourself to a... bastard?
Madam, you have extorted this from me.
Whatever were my thoughts of that poor, unhappy Mr Jones,
I had intended to carry them to the grave.
I would rather follow you to that grave than see you disgrace us by such a match!
Yes! Yes!
No, no, no, no, no!
I will not marry that idiot!
To force me to do so would be to kill me!
Then die and be damned!
Damn me! What a misery it is to have daughters, when a man has a good mare and dogs.
Tom, that pig-headed hussy dares to refuse to marry Mr Blifil.
I'll turn her penniless out-of-doors if she doesn't!
Go to her, lad, and see what you can do.
Sophie! Sophie!
- Sophie!
- Sophie!
No! No! No, no! No!
- Sophie!
- Brother! Brother!
Sophie!
Sophie... Sophie...
Sophie, Sophie... Shh.
My dearest, promise you won't give yourself to Blifil.
- Don't say that name to me!
- Tell me, tell me I may hope!
Tom, you must go.
- Sophie, please...
- Or you'll be destroyed.
The only destruction I fear is the loss of my Sophie. I cannot part with you.
Can't I make you understand, you country clot?
Tom Jones?
Damnation!
Where is he? That parasite!
That home-wrecker! Where is he?
There they are!
Tom, you must go. Quick, Tom, quick.
Run, Tom, run!
Come back here!
- I'll get thee if I hang for it!
- Tom, run!
- Sophie, please!
- Run, Tom!
You there! Allworthy!
- A fine piece of work you've done!
- What can be the matter, Mr Western?
My daughter has fallen in love with your bastard!
That's what comes of trying to raise a bastard as a gentleman, and letting him go visiting to nice folks' houses.
- I'm sorry to hear you say this.
- A pox on your sorrow!
I've lost my only daughter.
My poor Sophie, the joy of my heart.
Little did I think, when I loved him as a sportsman, that he was all the while a-poaching my daughter!
I wish you had not given him so many opportunities with her.
What the devil did she have to do with him?
He came a-huntin' with me, not a-courtin' to her!
What are we to do, Mr Western?
Keep the rascal away from my house until I lock the wench up.
I'll make her marry Mr Blifil here if it's the last thing I do.
I'll have no other son-in-law but you.
So go to her, you jolly dog, you.
I tell you, you shall have her.
And as for that son-of-a-whore Jones, if I catch him anywhere near my gal,
I'll qualify him to run for the Gelding's Plate!
Come on, Miss Slouch, come on.
Even the best of horsemen should avoid the bottle.
However, the forces of sobriety were gathering in all their strength against our hero.
We draw your attention to the abominable behaviour of Mr Jones.
He is a monster of depravity and should be expelled from your house this instant.
You let her out of her room after I locked her in?
Women are convinced by reason, not by force.
The English of which is:
I am in the wrong!
As soon as she came back to live with you, Brother, she imbibed these romantic notions.
You don't imagine, do you, that I taught her such things?
Your ignorance, Brother, as the great
Milton says, almost subdues my patience.
Damn Milton!
If he had the impudence to be here and say it to my face, I'd lend him a flick.
Come on, my girl.
He was, according to the vulgar phrase, whistle drunk.
On the very day of your utmost danger, he filled the house with riot and debauchery.
And he even struck Master Blifil.
How?! Did he dare strike you?
Oh, Uncle, I'm sure
I've forgiven him for that long ago.
But the same evening we unluckily saw him... with a girl... in a manner not fit to be mentioned.
Mr Thwackum advanced to rebuke him when, I am sorry to say, he fell upon the worthy man and beat him outrageously.
Tell me, child, what objection can you have to the young gentleman?
A very solid objection, in my opinion -
I hate him.
Well, I have known many couples who have entirely disliked each other lead very comfortable, genteel lives.
Madam, I assure you,
I shall never marry a man I detest.
I still believe the young man to have a few redeeming graces.
Some of the crimes you accuse him of sprang from his mistaken compassion for the gamekeeper and his family.
Compassion, sir? Lust!
All his gifts, his so-called generosity, were merely bribes to debauch another innocent.
As you know, the unfortunate Molly...
Miss Sophie Western will be the next to be undone.
All this I would have revealed long ago, had not Master Blifil begged me to give him another chance.
Send him to me.
Tom, I have forgiven you too often in the past out of compassion for your youth and in hope of your improvement.
You must leave my house for ever.
However, I have educated you like my own child and would not turn you naked into this world.
Here is something which will enable you, with industry, to get a good employment.
Goodbye, Tom.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, sir.
Stay, boy. Stay.
Mr Allworthy is very sensible of the many advantages of binding our two estates together.
Indeed?
I had not realised Mr Allworthy was so interested in questions of property.
Oh, he is.
And you?
I? Well, naturally my attentions are set constantly on those most blissful and sanctified pleasures of holy matrimony.
Clandestine amours so soon, Mr Blifil?
I pray you, Aunt, excuse me.
I feel a little... faint.
The fox, Mr Blifil, the fox.
Tally-ho!
It is you who have taught her disobedience, Brother.
You are such a boor!
Boar? I am no boar! No! Nor ass!
Ah, more-than-gothic ignorance!
As for your manners, they deserve a cane!
And yours I despise as much as I do a fart!
And as for your niece, I'm going to lock her up in my tower this time!
You'll do nothing of the sort!
- Honor, promise to keep your word.
- I can't, madam. I'm frightened. I can't.
- I'm frightened, madam.
- Aaargh! Aaargh!
Got you, my girl! Come on!
Come on. You won't get out this time,
I warrant you!
Our hero was now on the road to London.
His first adventure was with a party of those men whose profligate ways could be conducted with safety only under the protection of red coats.
Good day, gentlemen.
Which way are you heading?
- North, to fight for the Protestant cause.
- Against Prince Charles?
Those damned Scots are already on their way to England.
I've been walking all day and I'm hungry.
May I buy some food and drink?
- Right, give him some.
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Good day, Captain.
- Good day.
I perceive you are a gentleman.
We should be glad to welcome you into our company.
- I'd be glad to march with you.
- Good. We shall be on the march shortly.
There comes a time when men in a constant state of readiness for war will slip their leash and fight like dogs.
I believe... that a man can fight for no nobler cause than that of his religion.
Hear, hear.
I'd like to propose a toast to the Protestant cause.
Smoke the prig out, Northerton.
Smoke him.
Sir, were you ever at university?
Sir, so far from having been at university,
I was never at school.
Me neither!
I only presumed, sir, from the information of your great learning.
Sir, it is as easy for a man not to have been at school and know something as it is for a man to have been at school and know nothing.
Well said, young volunteer.
Upon my word, Northerton, you'd best let him alone or he'll prove too hard for you.
Give us a toast, young fellow.
Fill up his cup.
I would like to propose a toast... to the health, and bless the name... of Miss Sophie Western.
Sophie Western.
Sophie Western?
I knew one Sophie Western - was lain with by half the young fellows at Bath.
Perhaps this is the same woman.
Miss Western is a lady of fashion and fortune.
Oh aye, so she is, so she is!
Aye, it is the same young lady.
I'll lay half a dozen of Burgundy
Tom French of our regiment had her in the tavern at Bridge Street!
Sophie Western!
Sir! I can bear no jesting with this lady's character.
Jesting? Damn me if I was ever more in earnest in my life.
Tom French of our regiment had her and her aunt together at Bath.
You are the most impudent rascal on earth!
You've killed him, you swine!
Zounds, I was but in jest with the fellow.
I never heard of Miss Western in my life.
Then you deserve to be hanged. You are under arrest. Sergeant, take him away.
Arrest him.
But a hero cannot be lost until his tale is told.
For, heaven be thanked, we live in such an age where no man dies for love except upon the stage.
I'll kill you, Northerton...
I'm going to kill you, Northerton!
Northerton... Northerton...
Must find Northerton.
Must find Northerton...
Northerton!
Northerton!
Northerton!
Northerton!
Help! Help!
The ghost walks!
Shh! Shh!
Shh-shh-shh!
Come on, you, get up.
I can't afford for you to lie here idle any longer.
Get out and follow them rascally friends of yours!
You soldiers call yourselves gentlemen, but it's we who have to pay for you - and keep you too, for that matter!
- What are you talking about?
- That Lt Northerton escaped last night.
The rest of the company went in pursuit after him - and conveniently left without paying the bill.
- How could he have escaped?
- His doxy, a trollop called Mrs Waters.
The sentry disappeared and she let him out.
She'll soon learn what kind of a man he is.
Nothing's good enough for sparks like him, but paying the bill is another matter!
Don't worry, madam.
I will repay you handsomely.
Ah, sir... A nice young gentleman like yourself shouldn't want to get mixed up with them rough soldiers.
- It's gone.
- What's gone?
I had a $500 note in my breeches pocket and it's gone!
- That's a likely story.
- I had $500...
- You never had $500 in your life!
- One single note of $500, and it's gone!
- I should've known your kind...
- Who took it?!
Somebody's been in this room during the night and taken $500 out of my pocket!
Was it you? Did you see her take it?
Somebody took the $500 out of...
You lying rascal! Nor them cheating redcoat friends of yours, neither!
Go on, take your things and get out of here quick!
Go on! I'll set the dogs on you if you don't hurry up!
You blackguard! Robber!
The whole lot of you! You and your $500!
Wake up, you country stewpot!
Your daughter, sir!
While you've been lying a-bubbling here, your daughter is gone!
Rouse yourself from this pastoral torpor.
Your daughter is gone!
What?!
Come on, you lazy lot, and take the
London road! Come on, Miss Slouch!
- Are you wanting anything, madam?
- We're tired and in need of refreshment.
It'd be an honour to serve such a lady.
Has by any chance a young gentleman, a Mr Jones, passed this way?
Indeed he has. I'm surprised at a lady like you inquiring of the likes of him - brawling, thieving, bragging about his mistress - one Sophie Western.
- Sophie Western?
- I'm not surprised, after Molly Seagrim.
- But I am the same Sophie Western.
- Well, you can get out of here quick!
Go on! Follow your fine friend. Take your fine airs and graces with you!
This is a respectable house!
We don't want the likes of you here!
Our hero's next adventure concerns a lady in circumstances from which any gentleman would instinctively wish to free her - but of which any man who was not a gentleman might instantly want to take advantage.
Let her go, villain!
You savage!
Aaargh!
Sure, I've only myself to blame for trusting in a man so unworthy of my favours.
No, sir - you've had trouble enough.
My nakedness may well shame me. I'd go alone, but for the need of your protection.
Well then, in case any prying eyes should offend you,
I will walk ahead and escort you as far as Up... Upton.
So Tom and Mrs Waters - for so the lady was called - set out on the road to Upton,
Tom, like Orpheus leading
Eurydice out of Hell, hardly daring to look back in case the fires consumed him.
Sophie! Sophie Western!
Sophie!
- Cousin Sophie!
- Look, ma'am, 'tis Mrs Fitzpatrick!
- My cousin Harriet?
- The same.
Why, so it is.
- Cousin!
- Harriet!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way to London.
That is my destination. But why are you both on one horse, indeed?
Oh, Harriet,
I am running away from home.
And I too - running away from my husband, Mr Fitzpatrick, who's hot on my trail, I'm sure.
Oh, never marry an Irishman - particularly if he is eaten up with jealousy, possessed of a quick temper, and a mighty fool into the bargain.
But what will you do alone in London?
I have a friend. He has taken lodgings for me in Curzon Street.
Cousin.
He's a dear, kind man, and a peer of the realm.
You can stay with me.
- May I?
- Come on.
- But your friend.
- He is away for a few days.
When he returns we will make other arrangements.
Now get in, Cousin.
Two rooms, please.
And perhaps you'd find this lady a gown.
She's been involved in an accident and deprived of her clothes.
Take us to our rooms at once.
Heroes - whatever high ideals we may have of them - are mortal, not divine.
We are all as God made us, and many of us much worse.
All right, all right, I'm coming.
I'm coming, I said!
- Where's me wife?
- Who?
Me wife! Mrs Fitzpatrick.
I have come a distance to fetch her.
- There's no Mrs Fitzpatrick here.
- I know she's here! I know it.
Where is that serpent-toothed siren?!
Who's here, girl? Tell me, and I'll make you the richest poor woman in the nation.
There's only a gentleman - Mr Jones.
- No lady?
- He has a Mrs Waters with him.
Waters! I'll bet she's usin' a false name!
That cunning wench! By the waters of the Babylon I shall lay me down...
I'll bet she's lying down beside Mr Jones!
Show me her room!
Now where is she?
Where is that painted Delilah?!
- Down the end there.
- Mrs Fitzpatrick!
- Come on, Mrs Fitzpatrick!
- My husband!
- Your husband?!
- Do you think I don't know his voice?
Discovered, you whore!
Aaargh! Rape! Murder! Rape!
- What is it, lassie?
- A rape's going on down there!
Rape?!
Rape! Murder! Murder!
What is all this?!
Mr MacLachlan, dear friend!
I rejoice to see you here.
- This villain has debauched my wife!
- Your wife? What wife?
Do I not know Mrs Fitzpatrick very well?
And can I not see that the lady in bed with this gentleman is not your wife at all?!
Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape!
Girl, what's this hullabaloo?
'Tis Tom Jones, madam, in bed with Mrs Waters and discovered by her husband - an Irish gentleman, madam.
Forgive me - did you say Tom Jones?
Yes, madam - in bed with that trull Mrs Waters.
Betrayed!
Ma'am, pray forgive my dastardly intrusion. I...
What the devil is this disturbance?
I thought myself in a respectable inn, but I see now it's a bawdyhouse!
I have made a mistake.
I was looking for me wife.
These villains burst into me room!
I heartily ask your pardon, ma'am.
I thought you was me wife.
Though I see no reason for a gentleman to be in a lady's bed in his shirt.
I heard her screams and ran in from the adjoining chamber.
Adjoining chamber!
It seems I have prevented the lady being robbed.
- Robbed!
- Robbed? I'll have your blood for that!
- You wild Irishman!
- Rape!
Come on, Sophie, dear. We must fly before Fitzpatrick discovers me.
Oh, come, pull yourself together, Coz.
We've got a long ride ahead of us.
Help!
Sophie...
Ah, got you, you fox!
Well, the vixen can't be far away!
Goodbye, madam.
I regret I must take my leave of you.
Odds bodikins! After him!
After him! Damnation! After him!
- Oh! There he is!
- Miss Western!
Brother!
Don't be dismayed, sir. She will soon be tired and will stop in some inn.
- She's bound for London, I'm sure.
- Ah, damn the girl.
I'm lamenting the loss of such a fine morning for huntin'.
It's confounded hard to lose one of the finest scentin' days of the season.
Whoa!
Ha!
- Come on, Miss Slouch!
- What are you doing?
Oh!
Dobson, drive on.
Get up, there! Get up!
Stand... and deliver!
Whoa!
- What did you say, sir?
- Stand and deliver!
Deliver? I am no travelling midwife, sir.
Deliver what?
Stand...
I will not stand for you, sir - no, nor for any man!
- Madam...
- Don't you point that firearm at me, sir!
- Dobson, drive on.
- Get up there!
It is hard when a woman leaves a man nothing but memories - and a muff.
Your money or your life!
- I only have one guinea, sir.
- Give it here.
As a gentleman of the road you cut a poor figure.
Be merciful, sir.
I didn't mean any harm. Truly I didn't.
- No harm?
- It isn't loaded.
- Nor it is.
- I'm not a bandit by profession, sir.
Just a poor man down on his luck.
Mine, sir, is a sad story.
The start of my ruin was 20 years ago.
- It was all over one Tom Jones.
- What do you mean?
At that time I was employed as a barber by a Mr Allworthy.
One day he found a baby abandoned in his bed.
I was accused of being the father.
- Then your name is...
- Partridge.
Father!
But I do assure you, sir, there was no truth in the accusation.
- Then who was my father?
- None of us ever discovered.
That was the whole beginning of my downfall.
Mr Partridge, how can I make up for the suffering you've had on my account?
Would you take me on as your servant, sir?
- My companion in misfortune!
- Oh, sir!
Are lodgings cheap in London?
I have no money.
I know an old lady who runs a lodging house in London.
She was Mr Allworthy's cook when I was his barber.
No friend of Mr Allworthy's will speak to me.
Mrs Miller is one of the kindest ladies I know.
Who knows? She may get you back in his favour.
Here, you're a lovely boy.
Are you going to stay?
Good day.
No. No, thank you.
Desperate to find his Sophie,
Tom called on Mrs Fitzpatrick, who was entertaining a certain Lady
Bellaston - the notorious Lady Bellaston.
It's the handsome young gentleman again, madam, inquiring for Miss Western.
You see, Bella, how persistent he is.
His servant discovered this address, and ever since he persecutes us.
Send him away, Abigail.
Tell him Miss Western is no longer here.
Bella, you must let Sophie come and stay with you.
My protector is coming back, and I fear he may take too much interest in my cousin.
Oh, Harriet, you can always rely on me.
Your little maid is obviously in the right.
He's a very pretty fellow. No wonder so many women are fond of him.
Harriet, we must do what we can for Sophie.
The girl is obviously intoxicated, and nothing less than ruin will content her.
I'm absolutely certain Sophie was at Mrs Fitzpatrick's when I called.
Dear Mrs Miller, what am I to do?
No friends, no money,
I know nothing of London...
You're not to worry about the money.
You can stay here for the moment.
You're very kind, Mrs Miller.
For you, Tom. It's just arrived.
I wonder, what can it be?
What is it?
It's an invitation to a masked ball.
"The Queen of the Fairies sends you this.
Treat her favours not amiss."
It's Mrs Fitzpatrick, perhaps, with news of my Sophie.
Or Miss Sophie herself.
Vauxhall Gardens, where people come to see and to be seen.
In heaps they run, some to undo and some to be undone.
It's no fun for a man like me to be dolled up in this damned fruppery!
All folks of fashion are here.
Sophie will be no exception.
Show her to me and I'll have her arrested!
Arrested! Do you imagine a woman of stature can be arrested in a civilised nation?
A pretty civilised nation indeed, where women are above the law!
Civilisation, my trunk!
Je vous meprise de tout mon cour.
Now, where can my niece be?
If you engage any longer with that trollop
I shall tell Miss Western.
- Is Sophie here, then, madam?
- Upon my honour, she is not here.
Mrs Fitzpatrick - if you are she - it's a little cruel to divert yourself at my expense.
And do you imagine, good sir,
I have no better regard for my cousin than to assist her in carrying on an affair between you two... which must end in her ruin?
Madam, that is the last thing I would wish.
If the Queen of the Fairies had so little regard for you and Sophie, she would not have appointed to meet you here.
Confess honestly:
Are you used, Mr Jones, to make these sudden conquests?
I am used, madam, to submit.
If you take my heart by surprise, the rest of my body has the right to follow.
I hope you won't follow me.
I protest I shall not know what to say if you do.
Free chair, sir. Free chair.
You must be a pauper if you can't go in a chair. Or a miser!
I thought you were Mrs Fitzpatrick.
Fitzpatrick...
Sir, I am unfamiliar with customs in the country, but in town it is considered impolite to keep a lady waiting.
With our usual good breeding, we will not follow this particular conversation further, but attend results on the following day.
Our hero released from Lady Bellaston a torrent of affection - as well as a flood of gifts, which he found suitably embarrassing and quite irresistible.
- We must have you looking your best.
- Lady Bellaston...
Isn't that what Miss Western would want?
Come back precisely at four.
I shall have news for you then.
- Send the bill to me, sir.
- Yes, milady. Very good, milady.
Good day, milady.
How could Tom know that Sophie was now staying here with Lady Bellaston?
And being besieged by a certain Lord Fellamar, a gentleman with an eye for any beauty - especially when a fortune was attached.
I do beg you to excuse the play.
But when may I see you again?
Forgive me, my lord.
I'm afraid my plans for remaining in London are still a little uncertain.
Good day, my lord.
Aaah... Aaah...
Oh, my la... Sophie!
Tom!
I see, Sophie, you're somewhat surprised.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to look for you.
I found your pocket book at Upton and came to ask if I might return it.
- How dare you mention that place to me?!
- Oh, Sophie, let me ask your pardon.
My pardon?! After what I heard at the inn?
You cannot despise me more than I do myself.
I thought, Miss Western, you were at the play.
The play caused so violent an uproar,
I got frightened and came home.
Where I found this gentleman.
He has apparently found the pocket book
I told your ladyship I had lost and wishes to return it.
And when I do so, all I ask is that I might have the honour of presenting it in person.
I presume, sir, you are a gentleman, and my doors are never shut to people of fashion.
Thank you, madam. Ladies.
Your cane, sir.
Oh.
A handsome fellow. I don't remember ever to have seen his face before.
Nor I neither, madam.
I suspected it was Mr Jones himself.
- Did your ladyship indeed?
- Yes.
I can't imagine what put the idea into my head, for, to give this fellow his due, he was very well dressed.
I think, dear Sophie, that is not often the case with your friend.
I thought your ladyship had said he was handsome.
- Whom, pray?
- Mr Jones.
I meant, of course, the gentleman who was with us just now.
Oh, Sophie, Sophie...
This Mr Jones, I fear, still runs in your head.
I assure you, madam,
Mr Jones means no more to me than the gentleman who has just left us.
Forgive me teasing you.
I promise...
I'll never mention his name again.
Take this to Lord Fellamar and beg him to attend me tomorrow.
She is the only daughter of a country booby squire.
At the playhouse she blazed like a star.
The first moment I saw her,
I loved her to distraction.
Her father's estate is a good $3,000 a year.
Then, madam, I think it the best match in all England.
Then, if you like her, my lord, you shall have her.
Honor!
A letter from my mistress.
- Upstairs?
- Honor!
- In here.
- I told my mistress she should...
Get behind that curtain and don't speak! Shh!
- My dear, charming Lady Bellaston.
- Dear? Charming?
You've been avoiding me.
I should scold you.
But I don't think I intend to.
- Shh! There is a lady...
- A lady? One of your ladies, I suppose.
- Where is she?
- Uh-uh-uh-uh...
There is a lady in the next room... a-dying, madam.
What scheme have you and Sophie been plotting behind my back?
- Madam, I don't understand.
- Answer me one question:
Have you not betrayed my honour to her?
Am I neglected, slighted for a country girl, for an idiot?
Neglected, madam?
"I charge you not to think of visiting again", Sophie desperately wrote to Tom.
"The truth will certainly be discovered."
"Something favourable perhaps may happen."
"Until then, we must be patient."
Courage, mon vieux.
Lord Fellamar is one of the most gallant young fellows about town.
Make love to you, indeed!
I only wish he would.
You would be mad to refuse him.
Then I shall most certainly be mad.
Entrez.
Madam. Miss Western is hardly encouraging.
My dear lord, you certainly need a cordial.
Fie upon it. Have more resolution.
Are you frightened by the word "rape"?
All women love a man of spirit.
Remember the story of the Sabine ladies.
I believe they made tolerably good wives afterwards.
Come this evening at nine.
I will see she is alone.
Oh, I am so entangled with this woman that I don't know how to extricate myself.
- I know. Propose marriage to her.
- To Lady Bellaston?!
Aye. Propose marriage to her and she'll call it off in a moment.
You've not a penny, and she'll think you're marrying her for her wealth.
It's very convincing for a man in your desperate situation.
But what if she took me at my word?
Then I'm caught in my own trap.
I promise you she won't.
She'll be the one to break it off.
- Lord Fellamar.
- Miss Western, it is I.
- I fear I break in upon you abruptly.
- Indeed, my lord, I am a little surprised.
Love... Love has deprived me of all reason.
My lord, I neither understand your words nor your behaviour.
You're the most adorable, most divine creature.
I do assure you, my lord,
I shall not wait to hear any more.
If I were master of the world,
I would lay it at your feet!
My lord, I beg you to stop.
Let go my hand.
I will never see you again.
Then, madam, we must make the best use of this moment.
What do you mean?
I have no fear but of losing you, madam!
Where is she?
Damn me if I won't unkennel her now!
Aaagh!
Oh, Father!
- Your father?
- Yes. And who in hell are you?
I, sir, am Lord Fellamar, the happy man whom I hope you will accept as your son-in-law.
You're a son of a whore, for all your fancy falderals!
- I resent your tone, sir.
- Resent, me arse!
I'll teach you to father-in-law me!
Ooh!
Father, put me down!
Put me down, Father!
"Dearest madam,"
Tom had carefully written,
"I am extremely concerned for fear your reputation should be exposed."
"There is only one way to secure it - that you bestow on me the legal right to call you mine for ever. Thomas Jones."
Understand this: I shall not receive
Mr Jones if he calls here again.
In London, love and scandal are considered the best sweeteners of tea.
I do not doubt that my niece will welcome the favours of a man like Lord Fellamar.
This Blifil is a hideous kind of fellow.
But, as you know, Bell, all country gentlemen are.
I don't then wonder at Sophie's infatuation for this Jones creature.
He's an agreeable fellow to look at.
Miss Western, will you believe me when I tell you that he has the audacity to make love to me?
Oh, these men!
I would've torn the eyes out of a prince if he had attempted such freedoms with me!
Indeed, he's even gone so far as to propose marriage to me.
With your leave, Bell,
I will show this to my niece.
Apply it to what purpose you may please.
- It's from my Sophie.
- Good.
"Sir, " she wrote, "my aunt has just now shown me a letter from you to Lady Bellaston which contains a proposal of marriage."
"All I desire is that your name may never more be mentioned to your obliged humble servant,
Sophie Western."
You could try Mrs Fitzpatrick.
She might be able to help.
'Tis said that hope is a bad supper, but makes a good breakfast, and in the morning Tom set off for Mrs Fitzpatrick to seek help.
Not a moment too soon, for who should arrive but his old benefactor, Squire Allworthy.
Mr Allworthy!
What an unexpected pleasure.
- Good morning, Mrs Miller.
- You are come to forgive him.
- Forgive who, Mrs Miller?
- Dear Mr Jones.
Mr Jones, here, madam?
No, I've come to bring my nephew Mr Blifil to London.
She must be a most contemptible woman who can overlook merits such as yours.
An old acquaintance arrives.
I swear that dirty whore's had it now!
You wait till I get me hands on her!
Let us meet tomorrow. We will find a way of easing your predicament.
Oh...
Yes, tomorrow.
Thank you.
Oh!
I'm very sorry...
My dear sir, I hope no ill blood remains between us.
Sir, I don't remember your name.
Nor I yours, but I remember your face from the inn at Upton.
- Upton... Then your name is Tom Jones?
- Indeed it is, sir.
Then you have been with me wife after all!
Well, that's for you, you rascal!
And if you don't give me satisfaction for that blow, I'll give you another!
Fight, damn you!
Aargh!
- I'm sorry, but you drew this on yourself.
- Liar! You set on him to rob him!
I was coming out of the house...
Only to defend myself! He drew his sword!
Step back there. What's this all about?
Yes - for armed robbery.
- You're certain the bastard will hang?
- No doubt of it.
I hired these two to follow Master Jones - which they did with rare zeal.
Good. See that they're properly taken care of, will you?
I will break the news to my uncle.
Mr Jones has one of the kindest hearts I know.
He never mentions your name but to praise it.
Uncle...
I am afraid to tell you what has happened.
It may shock you too much.
What's the matter, Nephew?
Your adopted son, sir - Jones - has proved himself one of the greatest villains on earth.
If anyone else called him a villain
I'd throw this tea in his face.
Mrs Miller.
I know he's not without faults, but they're those of wildness and youth, and I am sure many of us have worse.
At least we're not footpads, Mrs Miller.
What do you mean?
Mr Jones has attacked a man.
He has been sentenced to be hanged at Tyburn.
Nobody can save him now.
If he swing by the string
He will hear the bell ring
And then there's an end to poor Tommy
He must hang by the noose,
For no hand will cut loose
The rope from the neck of poor Tommy
If he swing...
If he swing...
And Tom was to swing - his enemies had determined on that.
So Lawyer Dowling decided to pay a call on Mr Fitzpatrick, and who should receive him but Mrs Waters.
Strictly confidential.
I come from a most worthy gentleman, whose name at the moment
I am not at liberty to divulge.
What does this mysterious gentleman want of me?
He wants you to help him see that justice is done.
To make sure that Jones gets his just deserts.
For any assistance you can give him he is prepared to pay handsomely.
He is? You interest me, sir.
What is the proposition?
Meanwhile, faithful Partridge searched for anyone who could prove Tom's innocence of the charge against him.
Constable...
Constable, have you seen a man with a big scar on his cheek?
No, can't say as I 'ave.
But all the rogues in the district haunt that tavern yonder.
Will you accompany me?
I don't go searching for trouble, friend.
It's easy enough to come by.
Excuse me... Are you the two gentlemen that saw the fight with Mr Jones?
Tom cannot escape the gallows unless you retract your evidence.
I beg you to do so. And in the meantime,
I assure you, you will be rewarded.
Hark ye, sir, everything we said was true!
Now if I were you, I'd be off, or you're gonna be the worse for it!
Only one hope was left now, poor Partridge thought - Fitzpatrick.
Now that's better.
You'll be all right in a minute.
Come in.
Sorry for the intrusion, Mrs Fitzpatrick.
Well, if it isn't Mr Partridge!
Jenny Jones!
- But I'm Mrs Waters now.
- Whatever are you doing here?
I'm a close friend of Mr Fitzpatrick.
I'm looking after him.
Well, indeed, I came to see Mr Fitzpatrick to plead for your son.
- My son?!
- Your son, Tom Jones.
He never intended to wound Mr Fitzpatrick.
But I met the man who wounded
Mr Fitzpatrick, at Upton.
Then that is the same man - your son, Tom Jones.
With his own mother?!
- With Jenny Jones?!
- How could either have known, sir?
Good heavens, in what miserable distresses do vice and imprudence involve men!
Ma'am, there's a Mrs Waters here to see Mr Allworthy.
- What is she doing here?!
- The very woman herself, sir.
- You probably don't recognise me, sir.
- Indeed you are much changed.
But what business can you have with me now?
Such business as I can impart only to you, sir.
Pray leave us.
This, sir, is the very man
I was telling you about!
- But he is my steward.
- Nevertheless, this is the man.
- Do you know this lady?
- That lady, sir?
Mr Dowling, if you value my favour, you will not hesitate, but answer truly.
- Do you know this lady?
- I have seen her, sir.
Before my sister died, did she give you a letter for me, sir?
Come with me, sir.
Partridge, have my coach brought round at once!
Yes, sir.
- Uncle...
- Before I return, you'd best find the letter which your mother gave to Dowling here before she died!
Ah, good day, neighbour.
Are you going to see your bastard hang?
On the contrary, Mr Western, we're going to Newgate jail to save him.
Save him? Save him for what?
And this what Mr Allworthy is saying to Mr Western:
My friend Mr Fitzpatrick has now recovered and is no longer charging Tom with robbery.
I'm as pleased as if he were me own son - which, it may surprise you to know, he's not.
Mr Allworthy's own sister Bridget was Tom's mother, and I the one who put the baby in the squire's bed.
And that is what it says in the letter.
And so Tom is now my only heir!
Your heir? Did you say your heir?
Yes, neighbour. To Newgate, Goody, and drive for dear life!
But I always loved that boy best!
He shall have my Sophie by the hand!
Tyburn, here I come!
Come on, Miss Slouch! Come on!
And another old acquaintance has arrived, not only reinstated in the army, but now in charge of the condemned.
On your life, Goody, faster!
Turnkey!
I have come to release a Mr Tom Jones.
We sent him off hours ago.
He'll be strung up by now.
- But they can't hang him!
- I have procured this pardon for him!
- They can't hang an innocent man!
- They have done often enough before.
They won't have reached Tyburn yet.
We must stop them. Come.
If he swing by the string
He will hear the bell ring
And then there's an end to poor Tommy
Faster, faster, Goody!
Better luck in the next world, Mr Jones.
To die for a cause is a common evil.
To die for nonsense is the devil.
And 'twould be the devil's own nonsense to leave Tom Jones without a rescuer.
Aargh!
Oh, my dear boy! Forgive me!
Forgive you?
How can I ever make amends for those unjust suspicions I've held of you?
- You have always used me kindly.
- No, Nephew. I have used you cruelly.
- Nephew?
- Yes.
You are indeed illegitimate, but your mother was not this lady here, but my sister Bridget.
- Uncle!
- It is true, Tom.
Ah, this is no time for explanations!
Tom, thou art as hearty a cock as any in the kingdom.
Go on, after your mistress.
Alas, I fear I've sinned against her for all time. I doubt if she'll speak to me.
No, Tom, don't say you've lost her yet.
Go to her now.
- Go on, Tom,
- Go to her.
Go on, lad.
I will!
Ah, go to her, lad! To her!
Hark ye, Allworthy, I'll bet thee a thousand pounds to a crown we'll have a boy tomorrow nine months.
Happy the man and happy he alone, he who can call today his own, he who, secure within, can say "Tomorrow, do thy worst, for I have lived today."
Mr Moran, we going to be on time in Benghazi?
I don't see why not, Gabriele.
I'll ask Captain Towns to make a special point of it.
'1350. Radio out of service.
'Voltage regulators inoperative.
'Holding course for Benghazi.'
Thanks, Mike. I'll let you have them back.
- How's it going up there?
- Lousy.
Never yet taken off in one of Arabco's old tubs without something being wrong.
This time we've got faulty regulators and a duff radio.
Yeah, well, don't let that hold you up, mate.
I've got two months' leave coming in.
It's not the company's time we're flying on.
Radios are no good anyway. I got a radio.
Record players are nice, though. Reliable.
Thank you, Doctor.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
It's good of you oil people to give the Army a lift.
Not at all.
That's not much good, is it, Sergeant?
Stow it away with the cargo.
Oh, I meant to tell you, the number four control pulley on the starboard side seems a bit noisy.
Perhaps binding a bit.
I don't know, I couldn't see properly.
I don't feel it up here.
I'd better have a look.
Hand me the flashlight.
- Are you ready for another flying lesson?
- Haven't recovered from the last one yet.
Oh, now, I got her all trimmed up for you.
Just hold her straight.
Straight and level, two-zero degrees.
Here, I'll take that.
Straight. Now, don't over-control it.
Don't sway it.
Thank you very much.
I say, don't leave me holding this thing forever, will you?
Hi, skipper.
How are you?
Hey, Mr Bill. Here, try this.
It's real good for you.
One drink, the girl comes out of the picture and bites you.
Hey, skipper, you want some ouzo?
- Make you fly real good.
- No thanks, son. I'm driving.
I reckon I deserve this. Listening to that wog music has given me a headache.
The pulley's all right.
Squeaking a little, that's all.
- How are you getting along with your work?
- Magnificently.
But I think someone up there knows that I'm flying this thing.
That's quite a respectable sandstorm he's sending our way.
Yep, I've seen it.
So much for your weather report.
Let's have a look at that chart.
- If this thing closes in on us...
- This old bird will need a coat of paint.
- What alternate did you nominate?
- El Aouzzad.
Three stinking mud huts and a poison well.
That's not a place, that's a disease.
Oh, now, Lew, don't worry.
We're not about to start turning to alternates just yet.
We're bigger than a little local sandstorm.
Old Auntie at traffic management's gonna have kittens.
A pilot is supposed to use his own judgement, don't you think?
Gee, if it weren't for that...
I don't know, Lew...
I suppose pilots are just as good now as they ever were, but they sure don't live the way we did.
Well, I can tell you that there were times when you took real pride in just getting there.
Flying used to be fun.
It really did, Lew.
It used to be fun.
- You don't think perhaps we should...?
- Head for the alternate?
You'd better take a look out the window.
We're being followed.
There goes our alternate.
That stuff up ahead looks like it's rising.
We'd better find out just how high it does go.
I must say, without a radio,
I would have expected them to turn for the alternate airport by now.
Wouldn't you?
I don't know you, do I, boy?
Are you from the oil field?
My brother is there. Dorfmann.
I went to visit him on my holiday.
- You went to visit your brother in Jebel?
- Yes.
He's chief analytical geophysicist for the Arabco Oil Company.
That pilot...
I would have thought he was a little elderly to be flying without a co-pilot.
Wouldn't you?
That sand's a bastard, you know that?
A real bastard.
Hey, Standish.
Not while the train's in the station, eh?
It's not gonna let up, Frank.
There she goes.
Are we gonna put her down?
That right engine didn't make it, the other one probably won't either.
We're gonna have to put her down before this one quits, too.
Can you get any lift out of her at all?
Well, maybe enough to hop over a few sand dunes.
I'm gonna have to make it on the first try, if that's what you mean.
We going in with our wheels down?
I'd give anything not to, but we'll never get up again if I don't.
No, I suppose not.
What's happening? What is it?
- The lights are shorting out.
- It's gonna start a fire.
The cargo!
It's breaking apart!
Oh, no!
Lew?
Lew?
Come on, come on. Get a flashlight.
Let me out of here. Come on, run. Run!
It's gonna blow! Get away from the plane!
Maria.
Maria...
Harris, keep those guys together.
She won't burn now.
Get them back there under the wing before we lose somebody.
Lew, see if you can get the emergency lighting system...
There are three trapped in the back.
Three trapped in the back!
Dr Renaud!
Dr Renaud!
Dr Renaud!
Come on. Come on!
- Careful.
- All together now. Easy.
Here it comes.
The leg is entirely crushed.
- See if you can find my bag.
- What about the other two back here?
- They've had it.
- They've what?
Frank.
Skipper!
What are we gonna do now?
Do you want to say something?
Like what? "Sorry"?
There. Make it secure, will you?
Captain, don't you think it's time we started getting things organised all round?
Yes, I think you're right.
I'll get Sergeant Watson to make up some containers for flares.
- We'll need some of your fuel.
- Leave that to Moran.
Maybe you'd better check on our water supply and figure up some kind of rationing.
How much longer do you estimate we'll have to be here?
I mean, I take it there will be an air search before long.
Um...
Yes, well, we're not due in Benghazi till... well, now.
He's a right little organiser, your captain, isn't he?
Yeah, they're all the same.
Toffee-nosed bunch of gits.
You shouldn't have joined, should you?
I never did.
I was what they call a boy soldier.
Me dad joined me.
- Did he?
- Attendant at the public baths, he was.
November 21st, 1934.
Me mum made me a sponge cake for me birthday tea.
Next morning the old man walked me down our street straight into the barracks.
"You'll be all right," he said.
"You'll like it. I know you will."
1934, eh?
You didn't have to join for bleeding life, did you?
I don't know.
One thing leads to another, doesn't it?
Hey, Fritz!
Give us the loan of your book when you're finished, will you?
I don't think you'll find it interesting.
Oh, incidentally...
My name is Dorfmann, Heinrich Dorfmann.
Go on. Is it really?
Yes.
Hey, Sergeant, his name's Dorfmann.
Heinrich Dorfmann.
- What's the matter, Doc?
- Nothing, Mr Cobb. Nothing.
- How are you feeling today?
- All right.
What do you care? Anyway, why ask me?
You got it all written down in that little black book, haven't you?
No, no. I have nothing written down,
Mr Cobb. Nothing.
Yeah?
- Then why don't you show it to me, huh?
- Any time you wish.
Right now, though,
I have to have a look at Gabriele.
What a crummy quack.
They're all alike, huh? Huh?
'1600 hours. March 17th.'
What...
What about my wife, Doctor?
No, don't think about it now.
She'll be all right. She'll be fine.
Do you have any kind of liquor on board?
Well, there's still some morphine left.
Wouldn't that be better?
Erm...
I would like to save it for when the pain gets worse.
Doctor.
'Cause of crash: pilot error.'
Is it all right if we issue the water ration now, Mr Towns?
Sure, go ahead.
- Work something out?
- Yes, I think so.
Could I have your attention, please?
We have something important to say concerning our water supply.
Now, there is just under a full measure for each of us here.
And Dr Renaud informs me that we shall require, as an absolute minimum, one pint of water per person per day.
Is that right, Doctor?
Yes, that's right.
Now, on the basis of the 15 gallons in the emergency tank, that gives us roughly 10 to 11 days.
That is, of course, if we just sit here and don't exert ourselves in any way.
Hey, Lightning, do you hear that?
You're not to wear yourself out.
As we are somewhat off our original course, and unless we are certain of being picked up,
I think we ought to make do with the absolute minimum.
- Is that understood?
- Hear, hear.
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.
- Yeah.
- All right, Mr Towns?
Sounds reasonable.
If we have enough water for all that time, couldn't we set aside just a little bit for washing?
- Washing?
- What a dumb thing.
Hey, Captain.
What are we supposed to do for grub?
I reckon we ought to eat the monkey, don't you?
As far as food is concerned, we seem to be singularly fortunate.
There happens to be an almost unlimited supply of pressed dates on board.
- Pressed dates?
- All they're good for is regularity.
Yes, I quite agree.
They were being sent back from Jebel because nobody would eat them.
Yes, I think that's about all.
That's about all? That's enough, isn't it?
Thank you.
Excuse me, Mr Towns, but shouldn't some kind of rescue plane have seen us by now?
Now, don't worry.
Someone will be along even before you have time to think about lunch.
Our accounts people will be waiting for my report on the Jebel operation before they can get started on the annual figures.
How big a hole will a busted-up sky truck make in your annual figures, Mr Standish?
Well, there will be insurance, but... insurance companies move in mysterious ways.
Like God, of course, but not half as generous.
- It's bound to be a setback.
- I imagine it will be.
Anyway, you don't have to worry.
They'll be here.
Oh, thank you.
It will work very well.
The captain says our chances are good.
- A bit optimistic, aren't you?
- I don't think so.
Well, being 130 miles off-course isn't exactly going to help.
It's not gonna stop them either.
Music while you work, eh?
It's mine. I bought it.
Did it ever occur to you we could use this thing to find out what's happening?
Nobody told...
He did say something about it, Frank.
It's my fault. I should have...
It's mine.
What's the matter with this thing?
Look at Heinrich, will you?
Hey, shut that damn thing off!
What are you trying to prove?
I'm trying to remain reasonably clean.
You think this is some kind of a picnic?
That's just a local station relaying a political broadcast.
I don't think you'll find any station we want until nightfall.
Doctor, what was that chap talking about, anyway?
Water conservation and a five-year plan for irrigation.
A fat lot of use that is.
What this country needs is a few more pubs.
Fold it up. Get this stuff furled.
Tie it on so it won't blow away.
Get that line.
Give a hand. Pull, man.
- This darn wind's too much.
- Hold it, hold it.
Don't let it get away.
Close it up! Come on!
Close it up! OK, now, get aboard.
Push. Push.
Get in there, lock it up!
Here it comes!
Get inside. Come on!
Let's get the door closed.
How are you feeling?
Better have some more of this.
Come on. Up you come.
I think you like this better than I do.
That's all right.
As a matter of fact, I've given it up.
How's he doing?
Oh, he's fine. We'll have him back with his wife in no time.
But maybe too late.
No, no, you can't tell. Perhaps she'll be better by the time you get there.
No, she would never send a cable.
My wife is a very modest person.
She'd send a cable only if it were something bad.
Now, don't you worry.
We'll get you out of here.
He's right, Gabriele.
Do that.
The sandstorm will make it more difficult, won't it?
What, finding us?
No, simplify things no end, old chap.
They'll just bloody well give up.
You're not frightened, are you?
You don't want to be despondent, old man, you know?
Wait till the water runs out, then you can really start laughing.
They wouldn't really just give up looking, would they?
Never.
Don't you worry, me old duck, they'll find us.
Trouble is, we'll all be dead.

'I told our friend Standish we wouldn't even have time to think about lunch.
'That was three days ago.
'This is our fifth day.
'Most of them still believe it's only a matter of time before we're picked up.
'I wish I could be sure of that.'
This heat is intolerable.
You should come here in the summer.
It's lovely.
Hey, Sarge, look at this!
Hey, Abdul!
They went that way.
Abdul!
Your mates went flashing through here on a herd of camels about an hour ago.
Can they see us?
- There it is.
- Where?
Yeah, I see it. Up there!
Hey! Down here!
Down here!
Hey!
Down here!
- Come on!
- Come back!
Hey! Get down here!
- Here we are!
- Down here!
- Come on!
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!
- Come on!
- Come on down here!
- Come down!
- Come on!
- Come back here!
It's pretty high. Probably about 30,000.
More like 35.
Couldn't be the airlines, not in this area.
I don't think they could see us even if they were looking for us.
- Hey!
- Come on!
No, I suppose not.
- Hey!
- All right, come on now, forget it.
- You're wasting time, they didn't see us.
- Bloody pilots.
All them flares do is make a lousy stink.
Might as well quit using them.
Then there'll be nothing.
Nobody could find us.
That's right, Standish. Nobody will.
It's time we tried to march out of here.
Oh?
You've heard the others.
You know what they're thinking?
It's five days, we've had two sandstorms...
We're not sure they're even looking for us anymore.
They're looking.
Nevertheless, if we're 100 miles off-course...
Which way were you thinking of marching, Captain?
What is our nearest water point?
You said you could show me on your charts.
Well, yes, I can do that.
Tell me, though, how many were you thinking of taking with you?
Apart from Sergeant Watson,
I don't know yet.
Well, perhaps now's the time to find out.
Yes, perhaps it is.
He can't walk out of here.
No, of course he can't, but...
I suppose he's entitled to try.
- He's not entitled to kill himself.
- Oh, don't worry, Frank.
I don't think he's anything like aware of the problems involved.
I'll get the maps.
Gentlemen, I made a decision and I'd like you all to hear about it.
Now, I intend marching out of here.
The plan is to travel at night when it's cool and then rest as best we can during the day.
We leave at sundown this evening.
Sergeant Watson, would you come here, please?
I'll take Sergeant Watson and anybody else who wants to come with me.
If there's any volunteers, give me your names and we'll start making the necessary preparations.
Captain Harris?
You wanted to know our position.
If you'd like to come over here,
I'll show you.
Now, gentlemen, we're in the middle of this circle which runs through the three nearest water points.
That's Marada in the north,
Tazerbo in the east and Namous in the south.
Er, Marada is 106.
Say, London to Birmingham.
Except that Marada's not a city, it's just a flea-bitten waterhole with some borax quarries, an oil well and a few lousy palm trees.
Well, that's our objective then, Marada.
Say, Captain...
You done much marching in desert terrain?
- On exercises and that sort of thing.
- How far?
Ten or 15 miles.
Full equipment, of course.
- Plenty of water, I suppose?
- Sufficient.
Look, I don't know what your practical navigation's like, mine's not bad.
But I wouldn't march 10 paces from here.
In the daytime, it's hitting 120 in the shade.
And out there, there is no shade.
If you could take as much as four pints a day with you, you'd still be sweating 10.
We intend marching by night.
Fine, well, precisely in what direction?
- There are compasses, you know.
- That's fine.
That's just fine.
Someday I'll have you tell me just what your compass was reading as you passed the Jebel Haroudj Mountains.
They're mostly magnetic rock and that sort of makes nonsense out of the compass to start out with.
One can navigate by the stars.
But if you marched 106 miles by the stars and your calculations were just one percent out, you could pass the Eiffel Tower in daylight and never even see it.
Look where Marada is.
There's absolutely n-n-noth...
- Nothing.
- Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.
If you miss this glorious little bunch of trees, there's n-nothing between you and the coast, and that's 500 miles.
Well, nobody's suggesting that it was easy, Mr Moran.
Tell me this, Captain, are you right-handed?
- Yes, as a matter of fact. Why?
- Well, that means that your right leg is more developed than the other one and takes a longer step.
So, if you have an unreliable compass, it means that you just go around in a left-handed circle like that and there's nothing you can do about it.
Nothing!
You're right, Mr Towns, but you're talking about right-handed civilians.
You must know that in an officer's training corps, we military men are taught to march with absolute precision.
I might even send Sergeant Watson here on ahead.
As it happens, he's left-handed.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
Come along, Sergeant.
There's nothing you can do, Frank.
He goes by the book.
- And you can't re-write it for him.
- No.
Gentlemen.
- I've been examining this aeroplane.
- You have?
Yes.
We have everything here that we need to build a new one and fly it out.
Now, if you would like to have a look at my calculations...
- I don't know if you can read my handwriting.
- Are you trying to be funny?
- What did you say?
- I said, are you trying to be funny?
That is precisely the reaction
I would have expected from a man of your obvious limitations.
What's happening to everybody?
Here. Here, you can have this.
And here you are, Ratbags.
I won't be needing this anymore.
I won't be needing this either.
Hey, you don't have a coat, do you?
Here, take mine.
I won't be needing it anymore.
I don't think I should.
Why, what's wrong with it?
That's a good coat.
Cost me 50 bucks in Marseilles.
It'd cost more than 100 in the States.
- If you really want me to...
- Oh, sure.
I gave the radio to the boy.
I won't be needing it anymore.
I'm going with Captain Harris.
Hey, I got something for you fellas, too.
I got a lot of work shirts
I picked up cheap in Genoa.
They're good work shirts.
I only washed them once or twice.
Harris...
Don't you know better than to tell Cobb he could go with you?
How far do you think...? The man's crazy.
He wouldn't last a day out there.
Cobb? I haven't even spoken to him.
He seems to think he's going with you.
Does he?
Well, I'll have to disillusion him.
No, no, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Just let it alone for a while.
Incidentally, I appreciate your concern about me going, but I want you to know
I'm doing it all off my own bat.
It may be a gamble, but it can only increase your chances of being picked up.
Come on, Sergeant.
- What's happened, Sergeant?
- Must have twisted it, sir.
Let's get him over here.
Just tripped in the doorway, sir.
Must have caught it on something.
It seems there is nothing broken.
Perhaps you just sprained it.
Sorry we have no ice.
Looks as if you're for the sick parade, Sergeant.
Just my luck, eh, sir?
I suppose I'd only be a burden to you.
Well, it can't be helped now.
Perhaps, if I... if I could rest it tonight,
I'd be all right tomorrow.
I'm afraid we haven't time.
Don't you worry about it, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
What do you mean, "don't worry"?
You don't think for a minute you're going out there on your own?
Oh, no. No, he's not.
He's not gonna go alone.
I'm going with him.
- Isn't that right, Captain?
- I'm afraid not, old chap.
But I just told you.
I just told you I was going.
You're in no condition to come with me.
Sorry, but I think it's better that you stay here.
Why, I told you I was going!
I told you! I told you!
- Take it easy, Cobb. Come on.
- I told you!
- Let me go!
- Easy, Cobb.
- Let me go!
- Easy, Cobb, easy. Easy.
We don't want to hurt you.
I told you!
We'll all end up like him, I'm betting.
Leave him now, Captain.
I'll talk to him later.
Here.
Thank you.
- That an oil journal you're reading?
- No.
You're not in this line, then?
Line?
Well, yes. I mean drilling. Oil.
No, I'm a designer.
Oh, really? What, furniture, that sort of thing?
No, Mr Moran, aeroplanes.
I'm an aircraft designer.
Are you?
Then you really meant what you said about getting this thing out of here.
Did you think I was joking, perhaps?
No, Mr Dorfmann.
That I didn't think.
You always have to spoil things for me, don't you?
What did you have to tell the captain
I couldn't go along for, huh?
- I didn't tell the captain anything.
- Yeah.
Well, you're the one had me fired in Jebel, though, wasn't it?
Chief rigger, in charge of seven guys.
You think I couldn't handle a crummy job like that?
All I had to do was hold onto this lousy job for another six months.
I could have gone back to the States as a chief.
But, no. Oh, no.
You had to spoil it for me.
- Well, you still could go back.
- Yeah...
To what? They ain't gonna let no headcase run a drilling operation.
Nobody's describing you as a headcase, Mr Cobb.
That's what I came to tell you.
Now, you really must try to understand that fatigue mentale,
I mean, mental exhaustion can happen to anyone.
But it doesn't last.
Well, I don't understand all those fancy words.
I don't think those guys that do the hiring do either.
Well, possibly not, but it will pass.
It will pass, I assure you.
I tell you now, mate, we're better off right here than traipsing off on that bloody desert.
Do you think you can look after Chucho for a few days?
I'm gonna go along with Captain Harris.
- Well, well, yeah. But...
- What's the matter with you?
I thought you were saving him for some snotty-nosed Mexican kid.
Sure, but don't be jealous, Ratbags.
Maybe one day I find a present for you, too.
What's this "jaloose"?
Can't you learn to speak English?
Hey, why would you want to go walking off into that?
- Didn't you see enough of that in Jebel?
- Who knows, Mike?
Maybe after a few days walking we'll be better off than you are.
It's all right, Chucho.
It's all right, Chucho.
- I will be back. It's all right, Chucho.
- Easy, easy, easy.
Adiós, Chucho.
You must be bloody daft, mate.
Anyway, maybe Capitan Harris can teach me to speak real good English like you, my little Ratbags.
Stupid sod.
Thank you, mate.
- Good, you all set?
- Yes, sir.
Welcome aboard.
I'm not as confident that we won't make it as you seem to be, but I'd be grateful if you'd send up some smoke at midday for the next three days.
- Might help us to help keep our bearings.
- Three days?
Yes, we won't need it after that.
Ah.
Well, Captain, we all wish you every...
Well, you know how all of us feel, so...
Yes, well, come along.
It'll be getting dark soon.
We might get lost.
Hey, Babozo, slow down.
Remember you got flat feet.
Adiós, little Ratbags.
He's gone!
He's gone!
He's gone.
Cobb's gone.
I don't understand.
Can they see him from up there or can't they?
Of course not, he's just looking at the view.
Haven't you been up there? It's lovely.
There's a big lake on the other side.
They got speedboats, everything.
Frank, he's got six hours' start on you.
How far do you think he could get without water?
He didn't even stop to take a canteen.
And it's my fault.
I should have watched him.
Even if you find him, what can you do?
What can we do?
You'll be just as badly off as Harris would be.
I'm gonna bring him back, Lew.
You will see we have all we need:
Welding torches, steel cable, all the tools we would need.
For example, this here, it all looks quite adequate.
Why were they being returned?
Well, you know what engineers are like.
They just love shiny new tools, especially if someone else is paying for them.
The prototype I have in mind would have to fly at the first attempt.
To achieve that, Mr Moran, requires a pilot of quite outstanding capabilities.
Granted, this may not be the best possible advertisement, but Frank Towns is probably one of the few really great pilots left in this push-button world of yours.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, oh, really!
He was flying by the seat of his pants in planes that were n-nothing more than bits and pieces before you went to school.
That is precisely what is wrong.
He's remembered everything and learned nothing.
However, since...
Since he apparently finds it necessary to run off into the desert in pursuit of a lunatic who could be of no practical value to this project, the question is entirely academic.
Don't you think so, Mr Moran?
I agree.
Entirely academic.
Get away! Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Get out! Get out!
- What is it? What's the matter?
- It's three minutes after 12.
Don't you want to start the signals for Captain Harris?
And your Captain Towns?
Get out if it, you stinker!
It's Frank!
- Hey, skipper!
- Someone get some water.
I'll get it.
Frank!
What happened to Cobb?
You all right?
We're stuck here, Lew.
You know that, don't you?
Frank, I talked to Dorfmann again.
I... I...
I realise that he...
That he, you know, irritates you.
But I do think he knows more than we give him credit for.
Well, what's he dreamed up now?
Well, maybe he hasn't a leg to stand on,
I don't know, but you're the only person who's even remotely qualified to tell him so and all I'm asking you to do is to... is to talk to him.
Well, just talk to him.
All right, I'll talk to him, Lew.
If it makes you happy, I'll talk to him.
There's no component problem.
The port boom is undamaged and so are all the portside components.
If we remove the starboard wing and attach it to the port boom and perform a similar operation on the tail plane, you'll see that we'll have the basis of an entirely new and aerodynamically sound structure.
- Is that understood?
- Oh, absolutely.
We need only to clear the port engine of the sand that choked it in flight.
The Coffman starter is serviceable and we should have no difficulty starting up the engine.
If we don't waste too much fuel on signals to Captain Harris who's unlikely to be in any condition to benefit from them, we shall have enough of that as well.
Most of the hydraulic fluid has leaked away, but I've worked out direct rod and cable controls, so that is no problem.
All right, now, what are you going to use for an undercarriage?
Our last landing rendered the undercarriage unserviceable.
However, there is enough H-section in the cargo monorail and hull longerons to make up the skid cradle for take-off.
- Skid cradle?
- Well, er...
Skis, Mr Moran. Skis.
In order to take off, we shall have to move the final structure to the valley beyond that far dune.
The surface there should be adequate.
Now, as to whether it will fly, as far as the general design factors are concerned, there are no special problems.
The centre of gravity will allow us to distribute the payload, that means ourselves, on both wings.
Now, wait a minute.
Are you suggesting we string people on top of that wing like sacks of potatoes?
They'll be behind fairings, of course.
Never mind about the fairings!
We got an injured man in there.
The doctor says he can't even be moved.
You're suggesting we tack him onto this thing and bounce him around like a wrangler in a rodeo?
That is not what I had in mind, Mr Towns.
With the material and personnel available, this project would require at least 12 days.
How long did you say Mr Scarnati might be expected to live?
Six days?
Perhaps less.
See, the problem does not even arise.
Mr Scarnati will remain here.
Why, you really are a miserable...
Even with the men on them, the wing loading is going to be half that of the sky truck, because we shall leave the hull, starboard boom, undercarriage, chanson and so on on the ground.
Now, any more questions?
Yeah! Yeah, I have a few.
Now, let's see if I've got this straight.
You're just gonna unzip that starboard wing and lift it up all the way over from the other side and tag it onto this port boom.
Is that correct?
Well, yes. The tapers will be of course the wrong way, but...
The tapers? Forget about the tapers!
You know what that wing weighs?
I would estimate it at something just over a ton.
That's just about right.
Now, there are eight of us.
Do you think you can lift
250 pounds, Mr Dorfmann?
We use wedges and levers, Mr Towns.
There is also a winch and we can construct an A-frame.
All right, we'll have levers and wedges and we'll throw in a winch.
Look, this bunch is living on pressed dates with a sip of water every once in a while.
In a couple days from now, nobody's gonna have the strength to do anything around here.
That is a very good point.
The heavy work will need to be done first.
The wing will have to be moved tonight.
- Tonight?
- Yes.
I've worked out a simple winding gear for use with the starboard generator which will keep the batteries charged and provide adequate lighting.
I see no other immediate problems.
Unless you have some more questions,
I still have some calculations to make.
I thought it was all cut and dried.
You mean you have a few little things you haven't figured out yet, huh?
Well, naturally I discontinued my work when you decided to embark on your romantic search for Mr Cobb.
We do need a pilot on this project,
Mr Towns, and frankly, I considered your chances of survival quite remote.
However, now that you are with us again,
I can complete my calculations.
I see no insoluble problems.
Well, I'll give you one.
You say building this thing of yours will take 12 days. Well, that's just fine.
If we're real lucky, we just have enough water to last another 10.
We have several gallons of antifreeze.
We can distil enough to provide for another four or five days.
But certainly I agree water will be a critical factor.
So, maybe we'll be dead before you finish this thing of yours and maybe we won't, but that's what you'd call a critical factor.
Now, let me tell you something that makes nonsense out of this whole thing.
- Please do.
- And I'm not gonna give you the old veteran flyer routine,
Mr Dorfmann.
But I just want you to know that
I've been flying for quite some time now and it hasn't always been for crummy outfits like this one.
I'm sure you've had a very colourful career,
Mr Towns, but that's not quite the point.
All right, you know a whole lot more than I do about aerodynamics and drag coefficients and stress factors.
OK, OK. Your theory's fine.
But you get this, mister:
That engine's rated at 2,000 horsepower and if I was ever fool enough to let it get started, it'd shake your patched-up pile of junk into 1,000 pieces and cut us up into mincemeat with the propeller.
I told you there'd be no difficulty building this aeroplane.
I also told you it would require an outstanding pilot to fly it.
The only thing outstanding about you,
Mr Towns, is your stupidity!
- What did he expect?
- Shh...
- Easy, easy.
- What did you...?
You want me to throw a conniption fit with those drawings of his?
Say he's a genius or something?
What good would that do when I know the damn thing could never fly?
Excuse me, Captain, but perhaps...
Perhaps there is one other thing.
The way it is now, some of these men may not last as long as the water.
But they need to believe that there is hope for them.
I don't know, Mr Towns, but maybe to build a thing like this could be a lot of help.
So, we prove it can't fly and get killed in the process, is that it?
What're you giving us, Doc?
This is hard work.
These men can't stand hard work.
Watching each other die could be even harder.
I've lost five men, Lew.
Gabriele in there, he's on the way.
That'll be six.
Are you...? Are you asking me to kill the rest of them trying to get a death-trap off the ground?
I don't know.
I don't know, Lew. It won't work.
It just can't work.
All right, maybe it can't.
Maybe it can't and we'll all be killed.
But if there's just one chance in a thousand that he has got something, boy, I'd rather take it than just sit around here waiting to die.
You there, Mr Crow.
We'll need those panels again.
You must be more careful.
All right, Heinrich, I'll watch it.
Oh, he's a lovely little fella, a little ray of sunshine.
A slow, steady turn is quite sufficient.
You'll be relieved in about half an hour.
Don't let that needle drop below eighty.
That one there.
- Eighty, huh?
- That's right.
Now, we pull on three.
One, two, three.
Shift, you wee mother...
Hey, Bellamy!
You big horse! Come on up here and give me a hand, will you?
Hang on, little Ratbags. I'm coming.
My hand's tough enough.
You want me to leave this in place, Frank?
Ask Mr Dorfmann.
Leave both of the bolts in place until the trestle is ready to take the weight.
As soon as you have finished that...
Mr Moran!
Once you have finished that, would you please come to the tail end.
I'll mark out the assembly for you.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, what are you building, sandcastles?
Hashish, huh? Hubbly-bubbly.
Hubbly-bubbly.
What's it for? Come on. Eh?
I'm constructing a still.
The sand will prevent the tube from fracturing when I bend it.
That's very cunning.
Sometimes I wonder how you chaps never won the war.
- War?
- You know...
I wasn't involved.
That's it, then.
That's why they never won.
They didn't have old Heinrich.
Oh, no, no, no, no! No, no!
We won't need that second winch now.
Go around and get that cable over the apron.
We've got enough rope?
Go on then!
Don't keep Uncle Heinrich waiting.
Double up. Double, double, double.
Mr Watson? Don't forget, save those bolts.
Very good.
We need a spanner.
Erm...
Have you got a 3/8 spanner, darling?
Thank you, dear.
Give us a big, wet kiss, will you?
Look, knock it off, mate.
All right, everything's set.
Easy now.
There, that's it.
Come on. Come on, that's it.
Watch your step.
Are we ready, Mr Towns?
- Yeah, I guess so.
- All right.
Let's commence. Now!
Keep the pressure up. That's it.
Come on, come on. Come on, now.
All right, a little slower.
Easy now.
Don't let her loosen up!
Easy.
Come on, pull harder, come on.
Hold it. Hold it there!
Enough!
Stop.
Oh, Lord, I'm tired.
Harris!
Harris!
Well, Sergeant...
You've been holding the fort?
Yes, sir.
This is full of sand.
Clean it out for me like a good chap?
Yes, sir.
'We've worked at it two nights now,
'but Dorfmann's brainchild looks less like an aeroplane
'than it did when we started.
'It's almost midday and he's still working.
'He's right about one thing, though.
'The little men with the slide rules and computers are going to inherit the Earth.
'And it's kind of sad that Dorfmann won't be there to see it.
'But then, I...
I guess he doesn't need to see it.
'He already knows it.'
Here. Here, is that any better?
I'll try it.
Mr Standish...
You can continue with the cutting of the tail surfaces.
The tools are still in the hull.
Hey, Standish!
Watch your diet.
You don't have to eat all those dates.
Save some for the scum up here, will you?
Your wife's a lovely girl.
She died.
But you can't know that.
You there, we need help with the welding.
All right. We're coming, men.
It's getting cold up here, anyway.
Sisters of mercy!
Your brother will play the violin again.
Did you, erm...?
Did you say something to Captain Harris?
Now, what would I have said to Captain Harris?
Oh, I don't know. He's acting very funny.
Yeah, yeah.
In here!
In here!
Here.
We're ready to proceed.
Come along. It's quite essential to maintain our schedule.
Oh, I reckon we've been flogging a dead horse long enough.
Well, of course you're right, but couldn't we just rest for another hour and then...
Absolutely not!
- Come on, let's get...
- Now, now, before we start talking about who's gonna work and when, let me tell you something.
Somebody's been stealing water out of this tank.
Stealing the water? What do you mean?
Who in the hell would do a thing like that?
Skipper, you sure?
- Damn! How much is gone?
- I started checking on it yesterday.
How do you like that?
Now, I don't even want to know who it is, but I'm telling you this.
If it happens again and I see who's doing it, I'll kill him.
It was me.
It was you?
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
You... bloody fool.
In any case, I didn't steal it. I took it.
You took it?
The people here could die for lack of water and you took it?
Yes.
Yes, because whilst you people have been sleeping or pursuing your own ridiculous little interests,
I have been working.
And since I was working harder than you were,
I also needed more water than you did.
However, it won't happen again, because from now on we shall all work equally hard.
- Is it clear now?
- No, it isn't.
But maybe I'm an idiot.
Maybe you'll have to explain it to me.
If you think being some kind of a boy wonder entitles you to other people's water, you've got another think coming.
Why did you have to steal it?
Why didn't you just come and ask me for it?
Because you wouldn't have given me any.
You're damn right I wouldn't!
Now, listen, if you're coming up here to tell me I shouldn't be unkind to that miserable Kraut, you're wasting your breath.
Now, don't tell me you don't think he's crazy.
Well, suppose we agree he's as mad as a hatter.
Do you think the rest of us aren't?
Do you think you've been behaving rationally?
Do you really think anyone would?
All right, maybe not, but he isn't even concerned about getting out of here.
All he wants to do is to see that thing fly.
He doesn't care who gets killed in the process.
- Well, now...
- Well, nothing!
I've done my share of killing.
My score is five now.
What does he want to do, improve on that?
- So, we're back to that, are we?
- Yes...
You know, I don't believe you're really all that concerned about those five men.
- No, I'm laughing myself sick.
- No, you're not laughing either.
What really gets you is the idea that maybe you're wrong.
And maybe that little, er... little, er... dried-up calculating machine down there really does kn-know the answers.
And maybe Frank Towns, who's flown every crate they've ever built and who could fly in and out of a tennis court if he had to, maybe that great hellful of trailblazer's nothing more than a back number now.
And maybe men like Dorfmann can build machines that can do Frank Towns' job for him.
And do it better.
You're getting to be quite a little philosopher, aren't you?
All right.
Let's suppose you have killed five men.
And if it gives you any sort of satisfaction to sit up here feeling sorry for yourself, well, that's your... That's fine!
But if you really mean that it is all your fault, then it's up to you to bloody well get us out of here, isn't it?
And if you're not too proud to talk to Dorfmann, and you're half the pilot you think you are, well, maybe you will!
"If"! All right.
If you hadn't made a career out of being a drunk, you might not have been a second-rate navigator in a fifth-rate outfit.
And if you hadn't stayed in your bunk to kill that last bottle, you might have checked that engineer's report on the radio, and we might not be here. All right?
Oh, Lew, I...
Oh, Lew.
Why the hell isn't anyone on the generator?
What's the point?
Come on, you drunken bum.
Let's get back to work.
Don't worry. It'll be cut in time.
Do you think the Wright Brothers would approve?
I can't see why not.
It's all free and clear up here, Heinrich.
What's the drill, Mr Dorfmann?
You're not yet ready for heavy work.
I'd like to do something.
We could use Dr Renaud down here.
Perhaps you could relieve him at the generator.
Now, how about that?
Heinrich Schweitzer.
It's all set.
I think we are read...
I think we are ready to proceed.
All right?
Go!
We did it! That's it!
Are we all ready?
Let's go!
Hold it, stop!
- All right.
- Well done, Watson.
All right, now, everybody pull together.
Keep pulling. Keep going.
Keep pulling, boys.
Coming fine now.
Keep it going. Keep it going. That's it.
Don't let up with the slack.
Now, it's coming fine. Just fine.
Hold it!
Hold it!
Take it easy... now.
It's nearly there. Nearly.
Hold it!
I've got a story for the Daily Mirror when I get back.
"How I stopped smoking in three days."
Here, hold it.
You've done a wonderful job, Heinrich.
But will it fly?
Oh, come on, will you? Let's finish it.
It's all set up there.
You know, it's... it's really beginning to look like something.
Don't worry, Mr Towns.
Helicopters don't look very elegant either, but they fly reasonably well.
Really looks pretty good.
You suppose if we get out of here we're gonna have extra leave coming?
From Arabco Oil?
We'll be lucky they don't take this off our two months.
Tell you what though, if ever we do get out of here alive and I get my leave,
I'm going to stay put in Benghazi and fix myself up with one of them Arab bints.
That's not all you'll fix yourself up with in Benghazi. I've been there, mate.
No, straight up.
This place I was at last year, there's this bint.
Farida or something.
She did a sort of a dance.
You should have seen it.
I've woken up a few nights in a cold sweat thinking about it, I can tell you.
Probably some poxed-up old bag from Manchester.
Is it right?
What's the point of that?
Oh, I don't know.
I just thought I'd give it a name.
What sort of a name is that supposed to be?
It's a bird.
The phoenix was a mythical bird that burnt itself to ashes and rose...
I'm not bloody stupid, you know.
What's the matter, Captain? Smell the sea?
He's staggering around Benghazi, you know, with this ugly, ugly broad.
Boxed out of his mind with Kickapoo joy juice or hashish or something or other.
I've never seen anyone...
- Kickapoo joy juice...
- Shh. Hey! Hey! Hey! Shh!
What's wrong with him?
Get Mr Towns.
Eleven... I count twelve.
- They are way off any route.
- Yes.
Probably a razzia raiding party.
Better go and tell the men.
We don't want to rush into anything.
Tell Mr Towns to come up here.
I already have.
There! Up there!
Arabs.
I'm sorry. That's all I know.
But I don't get it. They've got camels.
They could take us out of here.
If they are a raiding party, they're outcasts from their own tribe and so far beyond the law that killing a few people like us wouldn't mean a thing.
They are, in all probability, lost.
And just as short of water as we are.
They can only cause difficulties.
If we leave them alone they'll move on and we can get back to work.
But why don't we just talk to them?
We can do that, can't we?
They sound friendly enough.
- I wouldn't count on it.
- No.
But we have to find out.
This time I'll go with you.
They're staying put.
Now, I'll take Sgt. Watson with me and we'll go and tell...
Now, wait a minute.
I've already told you that I'd be going.
What's the sense of these chaps building this contraption if you're not here to drive it?
- He's right, Frank.
- Nobody's going to drive this fool thing.
What?
Don't let's have an argument.
It's sublimely unimportant to me who goes out, but I think the Sergeant and I have the best chance.
Now, at first we'll tell them there's only two of us.
We'll approach them in a circle, so if they do prove to be unfriendly, they won't double back and find you.
I think the uniform might do the trick.
- Where's the Sergeant?
- He went in the hull.
Right.
Makes sense, Frank.
Here you are, Sergeant. Ready?
- What's the trouble, Sergeant?
- Nothing. No trouble, sir.
Come along, then.
I'm not going.
- What was that?
- I'm not going!
Sergeant, I don't think you've quite understood.
I'm giving you an order.
You are to come with me.
Now, look here, old chap.
There's only water for three more days.
This thing they're building won't work.
It's up to you and I to go out to those Arabs and get them to help us.
Now, there's nothing to be afraid of.
I'm not afraid, Mr Harris.
Sergeant, I'm going to repeat my order.
If you refuse it,
I shall have to assume that you're wilfully disobeying a superior officer.
Is that understood?
Don't let yourself down, Watson.
Report for duty and come with me.
You leave me no alternative but to place you under open arrest.
Give me that revolver.
No.
You refuse?
Very well, Sergeant.
Mr Towns, I am going out on my own.
Now, I suggest that you don't light any fires and maintain absolute silence until I report back.
I'll keep them quiet, Captain, and there won't be any lights.
- Right.
- I... I believe I go along with you.
- Thank you, but that won't be necessary.
- Perhaps not, but I do speak a little Arabic. Do you?
Well, not enough, but these fellows will understand.
Well, maybe not as much as you might suppose.
Anyway, I'd like to go with you.
Merci. Allons-y.
I'm gonna wait another half-hour, then I'm going down there and have a look.
- We can't just sit here.
- Look, Frank, Harris is n-no fool.
He... He may be a bit excessively British, but he's no fool.
If those people can be induced to help us, Harris will do it.
But I mean if the situation is a bit tricky down there and he's told them there are just the two of them, he can't suddenly announce there are seven more of us.
And if you and I go barging in, that'll really put the lid on it.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
I doubt it all the time.
Hey!
Captain Towns! Captain Towns!
They've gone!
They've taken our fellows with them, but they left a camel or something.
I can't see properly up there.
Frank, there's no...
Come on, Lew, we'd better have a look.
Camel's lame.
That's why they left it, it's lame.
Give me the...
He's dead, isn't he?
Mr Towns and I will be in the fuselage itself.
The heaviest men will need to be inboard, the lighter men outside.
They'll, er... they'll lie flat, holding onto the ribs of the windscreen.
We testing this engine today?
Mr Dorfmann, it's time we tested this engine.
- I think you can leave things to me, Mr Towns.
- No, wait. Wait a minute.
I'm not forgetting you're the designer, but if you want me to fly this thing...
"This thing"... This thing has a name.
- It's called an aeroplane.
- All right, all right, it's an aeroplane.
I'd have a lot more respect for it if I knew the engine worked.
The engine was running perfectly until the sand blocked the carburettor jets in flight.
There is no reason why it shouldn't run as it did before.
Unless you haven't cleaned the jets properly, in which case I'd advise you to do it again.
Now listen, those sand screens are clear, and I've checked everything under that cowling pretty thoroughly.
And if I'm to fly this machine
I'm gonna test run that engine today.
If... If we'd start this engine now, the vibration will put unnecessary strain on the whole structure.
Furthermore, there are only seven cartridges in the Coffman starter.
It could take four or five to start the engine, leaving us only with two or three when we are ready to depart.
I imagine even you will understand that once we have used all seven cartridges, we have no further means of starting this engine.
Any doubt about starting this engine, now is the time to find out.
Mr Towns...
You behave as if stupidity were a virtue.
Why is that?
Lew, I'm gonna run up this engine.
A couple of you guys come up here and pull this prop through.
And that's an order.
No, you're not!
There's no point in going over it all again.
Look, I've got them working on the fairings, but we need you for the control groupings.
There's nothing down on paper.
It's all... it's all in your head.
I'd hate to spoil the job after all the work you've put in.
I... I know it's difficult for you to get on with Frank Towns, but you've got to understand.
He need...
He needs to feel he's doing something.
You don't leave him anything.
- Do you want yours now?
- Uh-huh.
- You ought to come in, it's freezing out.
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, now I've really balled things up, haven't I?
Dorfmann?
Yeah, I've been thinking about this thing.
And I guess old Frank Towns just never could stand being told what to do.
That's all there is to it.
You know, funny thing...
He was right about the engine, too.
I guess I just wanted to make a point.
That's what really gets you about him.
He...
He always has to be right.
- You coming in?
- In a few minutes.
What else do you want me to say?
Nothing.
Leave me alone.
Tomorrow's the last day.
Then there'll only be what we get from the still.
And that's not enough to keep us all going.
Do you want them to fight over the water?
Is that what you want?
If we don't go back to work, we're going to die.
- All of us.
- Yes.
Well, for God's sake, man, you're not a child, are you?
Go away.
You told Towns he was behaving as if stupidity was a virtue.
If he's making it into a virtue, you're making it into a bloody science!
Ah...
Look, Lord Muck's woke up.
I want to talk to you.
No, I want to talk to all of you.
Mr Towns, who is in authority here?
You are.
Very well, then.
Since I am in authority,
I have decided to finish this plane and make it fly.
We shall now go back to work.
Hallelujah.
The fairings are about ready, but you'll need to look at the control linkages.
I'll be with you right after this here.
Well, is this the outfit you work for?
Becker Flugzeuge, yes.
I think I've heard of them.
Build all kinds of models.
Don't they build model planes?
The best.
I didn't know they produced the big stuff, too.
Well, the biggest we make is the Adler.
I think you'll find it on page 23.
The Adler has a two-metre wingspan.
But it's not one of my designs, because it's a glider, and I work only on the power models.
Page 23?
Yes, I think it's 23.
What about the big stuff?
Is it a different department or what?
The biggest I've personally designed is the Jaeger 250.
Could I have this a moment, please?
Thank you.
Wait, it's here. There it is. Jaeger 250.
It won the prize for extended flight at Frankfurt last year.
Ext... extended flight?
Yes. The radio control also is my design.
And then on the opposite page there, there's another rather fine model.
It's called die Schwalbe. It's there.
Yes, but I think what
Mr Towns meant was the real thing.
How much designing have you done on the real thing?
The real thing?
Well, yes. You know, like this.
Oh, no, no, no. You misunderstand.
We make nothing but model aeroplanes.
You mean you've never designed a full-sized aeroplane?
Full-sized? No.
But then, of course, the principles are the same.
Well, yes, they would be, wouldn't they?
Well, of course one encounters different problems, but basically the principles are the same.
I think I'd better check on the control linkages.
He's crazy, Lew.
He...
He builds toy aeroplanes.
He didn't even keep anything from us.
He really doesn't think there's any difference.
Well, what are we going to tell those guys out there?
They...
What are we going to tell them, Lew?
Nothing.
We haven't enough water left...
...to stay alive.
We can die here...
...or we can die in that thing.
What's the matter?
Haven't you any curiosity left?
Wouldn't you like to know how it feels to fly a toy aeroplane?
Now what's he up to?
I don't know.
Maybe we'd better have a word with him about not saying anything to the others.
I don't know why you keep humouring him like that.
If the thing can't fly, it can't fly.
That's all there is to it.
Anything missing?
No, I... I don't think so.
I'm arranging the harness attachments.
You'll be lucky if these guys can walk tomorrow, let alone pull this thing.
Nevertheless, it will have to be done.
The propeller itself will provide the basic impetus.
The men will mainly be to give it direction.
Well, why n-not n-now?
It's too dangerous in the dark.
Well, I think maybe you're right.
It's too risky.
Go on.
Oh, well, one other thing.
It might be better not to mention to the others about being a toy plane designer.
"Toy plane designer"?
Lew and I feel it might upset them.
Mr Tow...
Mr Towns.
A toy plane is something you wind up and it rolls along the floor.
A model aeroplane is something totally different.
Model aeroplanes have been flying successfully more than 50 years before the
Wright Brothers ever got off the ground.
They were not toy planes.
- All right.
- I didn't know that, Frank, did you?
Nevertheless, it is a fact.
And there is something else you should remember, Mr Towns.
A model plane has to fly itself.
There is no pilot to correct the trim.
Therefore, if anything, a model plane has to be designed for greater stability than what you are pleased to call "the real thing".
In 1851, Henson and Stringfellow built a rubber-powered model that flew 600 metres before encountering an obstruction.
Aerofoil surfaces, lift and drag coefficients, weight-thrust equations and the whole pattern of modern aviation originate from right there.
Well, where is he?
I'll go and get him.
Here he is.
Our friend Dorfmann's a bit impatient.
In 1851, Henson and Stringfellow built a rubber-powered m-model aircraft that flew 600 metres before encountering an obstruction.
Did you kn-know that, M-Mr Towns?
That's great.
No, not great, but significant.
You understand, those are the only cartridges we have.
If you fail with them, my work has been wasted.
The moment the engine fires, throttle back.
Too much unnecessary vibration could shake the structure to pieces.
Vibration must be kept to a minimum.
- Clear.
- Clear.
That's number one.
Two.
What's wrong?
There ain't nothing wrong with that engine.
Maybe he ain't giving it enough juice.
Three.
But he should know, shouldn't he?
He does know.
Wait.
Wait!
You're wasting the cartridges.
We have only three left.
I know that.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna use one cartridge, ignition off, clean out the cylinders.
No!
What are you doing? Stop! I forbid you!
I forbid you!
Do you hear me? I forbid you!
Come on, mate.
You'll make it.
Take it easy.
Hey!
Come on!
You bastard, Frank!
You bastard!
You made it!
Frank, you bastard!
Stop! Stop it!
Stop it!
Throttle back! I told you, stop it!
All right, Mr Dorfmann, start pulling.
All aboard.
I can't. I can't.
You did good, skipper.
Give it some slack. Come on, move!
That's it. That's it.
Watch your step.
Go!
Go!
What the hell is that?
Hey, they ain't gonna try to land that thing here, are they?
Well, it sure as hell looks that way.
Look at it! Look at it! Just look at it!
I've never seen anything so beautiful.
Seventeen days without a drink.
Boy, I wouldn't have believed just plain water could look so good.
You never know, Frank.
I might become an addict.
- It's beautiful!
- Where'd they come from?
Those guys are either drunk or crazy.
How far did you say that Henson and Stringfellow flew that rubber-powered model in 1851, Mr Dorfmann?
600 metres, Mr Towns.
Is that metres or yards?
Metres, Mr Towns, metres.
[BOAT HORN HONKING]
[SIREN]
All right, make way there, make way.
How long was he under,
Larry?
Seven or eight minutes.
He was talking and then suddenly just cut off.
Any hope?
Of what, reincarnation?
This man's drowned.
His suit burst.
He didn't have much of a chance.
With this suit, he had no chance.
One of yours?
Look, Doc, I rent them.
I don't guarantee them.
Look after him.
Uh, just a minute Doc.
What do we owe you?
Not a thing.
It's part of my job.
I understand you're looking for sunken treasure.
Mm-hmm.
Spanish gallions.
Hmm. Makes sense.
Doctor.
The diver--we didn't know him very well.
Did he have a wife?
No,my dear.
He didn't have a wife, and he had no family.
Bless you for the question.
You know, for a little while,
Ithought that nobody gave a damn.
Did I draw?
You drew.
Light's bad.
Throw the queen away.
Queen?
Queen. Before I catch you with the store.
Queen.
Awfully good choice.
Gin.
You have exceptional card sense, old friend. exceptional card sense.
Application my dear Linc, just simple application.
Next week, you can look at my hand.
I'll ask the bartender.
Excuse me, do you know a Mr. Mark Brittain?
Is he here?
Yes sir,Over there.
Back of the trellis.
Fellow with the cap?
That's right.
Thank you.
Come on, Rosa.
Well, Mr. Brittain.
Fellow named Trench said
I'd find you in here.
You found me.
I'm Victor Rossiter.
How are you? don't you feel a little left out?
Oh, come here.
My name is Rosa Lucchesi.
Yeah.
Can we buy you a drink?
Thanks, we got one.
This fellow Trench says that you were a lieutenant, in a submarine.
That I was, and I was many things..
Mm-hm, well, so was I.
But I was also on a destroyer.
You trying to start a legion post here,
Mr. Rossiter?
Trench also said that you were a good diver, and for a price, you'd put on a suit.
For a good price, I'd put on a suit, but not one of Trench's suits.
That would take more money than you've got and more of a death wish than I've got..
We'll order a new diver's suit.
Haven't you had enough?
You lost one diver today, right?
Well that won't happen again.
We've got a map, Brittain..
An authentic map.
We've got a map, too.
We got it at the gas station.
A galleon went down 3 miles from here.
It carried gold bullion worth millions of dollars.
That it did, Miss Lucchesi.
And 10 miles up the coast, a ship called the Sevilla hit a reef and sunk full of pearls and emeralds.
North of the cove, there was a ship called the Almirante.
It had its magazine blown up.
It was carrying treasure to King Philip.
Lady, I've lived here a lot of years..
I can read you every legend, in Spanish if you like.
You name the ship,
I'll draw you the riggings.
This map shows exactly where that ship went down.
None of us can dive, but you can.
You name the price.
You can have it in cash or a piece of the action.
Piece of what action?
Don't you realize that every 50 years some dedicated professionals get lucky and come up with a find?
You're not dedicated professionals.
You're a brotherhood of happy, free-swinging thinkers.
You've got a crap shooter's instinct.
Why don't you go to Vegas?
You'd be better off.
Please, look at this.
[VICTOR]
Hmmm?
That's quite a map.
But Mr. Langley and I are very busy.
We charter a small but dependable fishing boat to people who like to go to sea and catch bass and not pieces of eight, which they can't.
What part of Italy are you from, Miss Lucchesi?
Naples.
Must be beautiful there this time of year.
Well...
Well, you may change your mind.
If we're not on board, you can find us at this motel right here.
And if you'd like to charter a fishing boat, we're at the dock.
Ask anyone.
Imagine her drinking red wine with a 50 cent sharpie like him.
That's a beautiful woman.
She walks well.
You're quite right.
She walks well.
[WHISTLING]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Give me a stick. I'll beat it to death.
Blessings on Thee,
O Landlord.
Barefoot boy with cheek of jowl.
Stand aside while the crew boards.
You ain't boarding this boat..
Not tonight.
Maybe never.
You're wrong, Mr. Trench.
Short of a hurricane or your departing this earth, we're going to board this boat, and you're a minute away from losing your teeth..
Brittain, you owe me 190 bucks for dockage,
$363 for gas,
$88 for ice and supplies.
That makes a total of $641 overdue and collectable.
We never hung you up on a bill.
I ain't going to let you.
I ain't no credit union..
You bring the dough, you can get on this boat.
You got till tomorrow night.
Can't we sleep on board?
You've got the keys.
We can't go anywhere.
You can't go anywhere because I'm keeping the keys.
Gently, gently Trench, gently.
Look Brittain,
I'm going to tell you one more time...
Don't poke, Trench.
Don't you know how it can irritate a guy?
Let that remind you to keep a civil tounge in your big, fat head..
And also to check out your diver's suits..
Can he swim?
We'll check the morning papers.
Good morning.
Does Rossiter live here?
That's correct.
I'm one of his party.
You're Brittain.
Mm-hmm.
Come in.
Mr. Rossiter and Miss Lucchesi are in town hoping to find a new diver.
I expect them shortly.
Cup of coffee?
Thanks, no.
Forgive me.
I'm Eric Lauffnauer.
We have, uh something in common, Mr. Brittain.
What's that?
Iwas in the submarines also.
Hmm. I wonderwho invaded Europe?
Everbody I've met in the past 24 hours is an old salt.
We have the makings of a select fraternity.
That so?
Rather fortunate
Though, that we didn't meet during the war.
I commanded the U-17.
There is always two sides to every question,
Mr. Brittain.
True.
What kind of sub were you on?
Fleet type.
I was in the Pacific.
We operated in the Atlantic.
Come out alright, did you?
No. I was drowned off Okinawa.
I mean your sub.
The man's here to take the job, Mr.Lauffnaur.
I only reminisce about the war on Memorial Day.
We'll try it again after lunch.
Well, well, well, well.
Here you are, Eric.
Thank you..
You decided to join us, eh Mr. Brittain?
I decided to work for you.
I am glad to hear that.
One hour down,six hours off.
Three days.
That'll be 700 bucks, payable in advance.
That's a little stiff, isn't it?
I might be a little stiff before I find your galleon.
That's the tab,
Rossiter.
It's alright.
In advance.
Yeah, fine, fine.
It's a deal.
We've got new equipment coming over from Orlando's.
It'll be here tomorrow before lunch.
It's a good start.
Thank you.
What kind of a compressor have you got?
We're using Trench's
Not with me you're not using Trench's.
There's a marine store downtown called Daley's.
You can rent one down there.
Check your boat in.
We'll use mine.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Firm type, huh?
Knows what he wants.
Wear slacks from now on will you, Baby?
I don't want him frustrated.
Everything fit?
Itspassable.
[STARTS ENGINE]
Now let's go..
Checked out the compressor.
And the helmet, too.
Any special instructions?
Nothing special.
Just keep me alive.
You bet.
What's holding things up fellas?
Patience, Victor,
Patience.
He's only good to us alive.
You told us one hour at a time.
I'd like you to put something into that hour.
 I've got afew thousand pounds of weight on me,
 so relax.
It's going to take a while.
[MARK]
Hey, partner.
What have you got,
Mark?
 The fatigue and the blues.
 Pull me up,
Linc.
Now, wait a minute.
You've still got
8 or 10 minutes of the hour left.
 Well, you can have them back,
Buddy.
 Pull me up.
Pull him up right away.
Let's not have the same thing happen again.
All right.
Pull him up.
 Hold it. wait a minute. hold it.
Did you find something?
 Think so, yeah. <i/>
What is it Mark?
What is it?
 It's a sight to delight
 Mr. Lauffnaur's practiced eye.
 I wish you were down here,
<i/>Herr Kapitan.<i/>
 The nostalgia would kill you.
Describe it.
 Hmm, very simple. <i/>
 It's a German submarine, <i/>
Kapitan.
 Ask Rossiter if he'll settle
 for World War II souveniers,
 Or we could raise her
 and you could put her in your parlor as a memento.

[MARK]
All right, Linc..
Pull me up.
What sre you looking for Eric, ghosts?
Really incredible.
She was one of the small jobs.
Reported missing
I think about 1943.
Hmm, fascinating.
Well, thanks for nothing, Brittain.
I guaranteed a look, not a find, Buddy.
What do you guess her tonnage to be?
Oh, I don't know.
I'd say maybe 300.
She looked undamaged.
My guess is that her ballast tanks are still full.
What looked like the escape hatch was closed.
I don't know if anybody got out of her, but she's probably full of sea water anyway.
What if her valves held?
They might have held.
If her valves held, she's dry. So what??
With the tanks blown, we could raise her.
Raise her?
Raise her?
What the hell would we do with a submarine?
Refit her. Use her
For sightseeing.
Sell her to a museum.
The possibilities are endless.
Brittain, do you think you could find it?
The sub, probably.
Do you think you could find it right now?
Again, probably, but why?
I'd like you to attach a line and float a buoy.
You mean right now?
Right now.
That'll be overtime.
We'll pay you.
Where do you get this "we"?
Rosa's doing the financing, check with her.
You have a reason?
Yes.
I'd like to think it out.
Then I'll explain.
That's good enough for me.
All right, we'd better get to it.
There's not much daylight.
Lincoln, let's go.
Hey, uh Captain?
Mm-hmm?
You ever get depth-charged?
Yes, often.
Slip and fall down and maybe hit your head a little bit?
I'm quite sane, Mr. Brittain.
Big deal. So now we lasso a submarine..
Would you like to explain why, Eric?
If we can raise her and refit her...
Why not play pirates.
Good evening.
Evening. You want Mark?
Yes, I'd like to see him.
Hey Mark.
Yo!
We've got company.
Well...
Oh, hello.
I was afraid you might be sleeping.
No, it's too early for that. Come on aboard.
Thank you.
Watch your head. beautiful night, huh?
Like Naples?
Stars are stars.
Ever look at them, Mr. Brittain?
On occasion, yes.
For navigational purposes only.
Mm-hm, but not romantically?
Tell me something,
Miss Lucchesi, is this a mid-week seduction or the opening gambit of a con job?
Is that how I strike you?
You're financing this whole operation, are you not?
Yes, with all the money I have, Mr. Brittain.
In Italy, during the war,
I lost my family, my illusions, my patience.
I want only one thing now--
To never be cold or wet or hungry again.
Is that terrible for you?
Well, it depends.
If you're telling me that you'll settle for three meals a day and Vic Rossiter, then I got to say
You got cheap tastes.
But if you're looking for sable and a deluxe cruiser, well, that makes more sense.
I want more than that.
I want my life to be whipped cream and silk sheets.
And without problems.
You're not exclusive.
Perhaps I am not.
I'll steal, if necessary.
But, uh I have certain reservations.
That's interesting.
Now, what kind of reservation?
For instance uh, a hot stove you wouldn't steal?
I wouldn't steal from those whocouldn't afford to lose.
How do you like this?
A blonde Italian Robin Hood.
What about you,
Mr. Brittain?
Do you have a master plan or a set ofdreams?
I don't need them.
I just live my life as I see fit, and do what I want.
I have a ball.
I take things as they come.
Then take this, will you?
This is the sort of thing that comes one time in your life.
Go on.
Eric has an idea, an incredibleidea.
If we could raise that sub, get it yo work, why not pirates?
You're kidding me.
You think I'm kidding?
A hijack with a submarine?
Mm-hmm.
I got a better idea.
We put you in a bikini and strap you to the wings of a 707, and we fly you over Fort Knox.
While all the people on the ground are looking at you, we sneak in the back door and steal the gold.
Please.
Take me seriously.
You I take seriously.
But not some pipe dream about running off in a submarine to pull a heist on the high seas.
That, Miss Lucchesi, is for laughs.
Have you ever thought about what you could get by even pointing a gun at an ocean liner?
30 years, if we're lucky.
Failing that, that leaky war memorial at the ocean bottom might wind up back at the ocean bottom, but this time with all of us in it.
Will you come over to the motel and discuss this?
I don't think so.
If you're so difficult now, Mr. Brittain, how can we ever become friends?
I got a funny feeling we are friends.
Very good friends.
Linc.
What?
There are three idiots over at the motel having a seance, and they need two more idiots to make a quorum.
And they sent for us?
Who else?
We could stop the Queen Mary anywhere here, just off the coast of Abaco Island.
We'll travel at night, surface, wait for her.
Wait a minute.
Just a moment.
That submarine's been on the bottom of the ocean for 20 years.
Brittain, let me ask you something.
Can you guarantee that you'd be able to raise her?
I guarantee you nothing.
For argument's sake,
Mr. Lauffnaur, let's assume she's dry.
Let's further assume you can raise her and get her in operating condition.
Enter the gracious Queen.
What are you going to do with her?
Or to her?
There must be thousands of dollars in the bank and gold in her bullion room.
We could take a million dollars.
I'll bet it could even be more than a million.
This could be the biggest heist ever.
It could be a lot of things...
Assuming you can get the Queen Mary to stop for you.
Man has a big point.
Think of it this way.
Think of a submarine as a big pistol that holds men and machinery.
Then you aim this pistol at the head of your victim...
Full of blanks, mind you-- torpedoes with dummy warheads.
But the victim, the Queen Mary, does not know this.
I believe we can assume
that our Queen won't take any unnecessary risks.
She'll allow herself to be boarded.
Then, as Rosa has suggested, it's gold bullion and cash.
We go back to our submarine, submerge, leave the scene.
Yeah, and figure the take.
A million bucks or more.
We could walk away from this with nothing to worry about for the rest of our lives.
Yeah, I like it.
It makes sense.
It makes sense if you win the game.
The game you're a playingis that you're holding an unloaded pistol at a stranger's head.
You figure he's going to throw up his hands.
Suppose the stranger spits in your eye and says,
"Go ahead and shoot."
What the hell are you going to do then?
Now, hold on, this is all a joke, right?
Nobody here thinks this is going to work?
You just get this clear.
If you don't think it can work, you don't belong on this trip.
I don't relish the ides of being cooped up in a sub
with a caramel-colored lush, anyway.
Forgive him, Linc, please.
He didn't mean it.
I'll take your word for that.
Hey, come on, this is ridiculous.
Why the argument, huh?
Let's get on with the, uh, with the business.
Did you know this thing is so wild, it can work?
It's so nutty it can work.
Eric...
You think it's possible.
What about it?
I take it you are willing.
We all have special needs,
Mr. Brittain.
I wish it were catching.
I'd like you along.
Let's take it by steps.
First we got o find an enclosed mooring somewhere down the coastline where it's nice and quiet, nobody around, check?
Check.
Then tomorrow,
I'll go over and see if I can't raise that submarine.
Lieutenant Brittain, what a pity we have never before served in the same navy.
We should do very well together.
You just see you run a taut ship, Commander, because in this little war, we're going to need one.
Let's go.
Look at the buoy.
He must have reached the sub.
How long will it take him, Eric?
15 minutes, half hour.
Maybe longer.
Not much longer.
It better not take him much longer.
What will he do?
He'll go to the escape hatch.
If the trunk underneath is flooded he might get it open.
If he does, he'll move inside and close the hatch...
Once he's inside the tube... he'll, uh, try to open the drain.
Go on.
Then what?
At that point, either the water just stays there, unmoving, because the sub is filled with water, or it will drain away.
If it does, he'll try to open the lower hatch.
But if it's not possible, he'll come up?
There's 100 feet of sea water
35,000 pounds on that hatch.
He could never open it.
Then you'll have to take up another card game, and we'll have missed another one.
Victor, please.
Hey, hey, come on Baby,
What's the matter?
Nobody dies in Italy?
58 minutes.
Well, kiss him off.
Eric, any...chance?
He's got a job down there.
He's got to stay on his lung, because if that sub is dry,
It'll all be dead air and damn little of it.
He'll blow the ballast if he can.
But there's a lot of ifs.
The valves of the air flask have to hold.
There's got to be enough pressure to blow all the water from the ballast.
He's got quite a job.
Hey!
Hooray!
[ENGINE STARTS]
Upsy-Daisy.
Give me that light.
Quite an exceptional gentleman... in his day.
He was left here... probably at his own orders so that his men could get out.
Then he, himself, filled the ballast tanks to let the sub sink.
Then he just sat....
Waiting to die.
Well, what do you want to do, stuff him and sell tickets, Hmm?
We'll get hold of some fishing nets, some canvas...
And bury him at sea?
Yes.
Would you help me?
I'll find some canvas.
I can think of a hundred better ways to die.
All right, let's get this stuff ashore and burn it.
Pass this along.
Rosa!
Yes.
Pass this through.
Victor!
We're going backto the boat, Mark.
Yeah, O.K.
Come along as soon as you're through.
Check.
Well, what's the verdict?
4-0 is the verdict.
She's in better shape than we dared hope.
Not too much corrosion, little damage.
Batteries are dead, naturally.
That's probably what stopped her to begin with.
Let's get started,
Huh?
What's the first thing?
I want a drink first.
What we need now is a mechanic. A good mechanic, somebody who knows sub engines inside and out.
That's great.
We'll put an ad in the paper.
No need.
I know such a man.
I worked in the Brooklyn navy yard a while back.
Met a chap named Moreno.
He can strip an engine and put it together again in his sleep.
He car repair anything from an ocean liner to a sailboat.
He'd he well worth his cut.
Eric, what would his cut be?
Even shares all around.
Isn't that what we decided?
Sure, sure.
But someJonny-Come-Lately greasemonkey who contributes a screwdriver...
How does he figure to get a full share?
Rosa, you know something,
We start divvying this up too many ways, that's going to shrink the melon.
If Eric says he's needed, he's s partner.
He's a partner if he wants to be a partner.
I think we're taking a little too much for granted, here.
How do we know he'll sit still for this?
You'd be amazed at what some people will sit still for.
Mr Moreno and I have been involved in several transactions.
I've never known him to fail me.
Are you saying you got something on Moreno?
Maybe a little more than he's got on me.
At any rate, his morality is as flexible as ours.
He is what your navy calls
"Dishonorably
Discharged".
You think you can locate this man?
I'll start tomorrow.
It shouldn't be too difficult.
Well, that settles that.
Let's go ashore and get some sleep.
It's getting late.
No. I'd like a swim first.
Well, now baby, it's past midnight.
Why don't we settle for a hot bath?
You got a bathing suit,
I got some towels below.
I'm sure you do, but the lady needs her sleep.
Just so we don't misunderstand each other, Brittain.
We don't share everything alike.
What was owned before, that's not in the pot.
So we don't have anymisunderstandings--
Nobody owns me.
You have a few prerogatives,
Victor, but that's a gift from me to you.
I can revoke the license anytime.
May I use your cabin, please?
Thank you.
I'll go with you.
The young lady can swim her way back home.
You step on my toes a lot, Brittain.
I'm unaccustomed.
Cry a little baby, so I'll know.
You'll know, believe it.
You don't get out of there, you're going to grow a fin.
Ahh...Brrr!
Ever been a masseur?
No, but I could kick myself.
Linc, throw me that that little jacket, will you?
Thank you.
Where'd you learn to swim so good, diving for coins in the Bay of Naples?
I do everything with perfection,
Mr. Brittain--
Swimming, dancing, fundraising, almost everything.
And you?
I play a little gin.
I catch a little fish.
If I catch a lot of fish,
I get splendidly stoned.
It's a living.
I think
I swim home now.
Yes, but that's only half way.
When you get on the shore, you have to walk the rest of the way in a wet bathing suit.
Let me drive you to the pier.
I'll be there before you can start the engines.
That isn't exactly the Brooklyn navy yard.
Mark, this is
Tony Moreno.
He tells me you're s shark with engines.
Depends on the engines.
Where's the boat?
Right in there.
Are you serious?
I didn't say it was just launched.
You didn't say it came out of a museum, either.
I ain't seen one like this in 20 years.
It grows on you.
I got enough growing on me.
When do I start?
You've already started.
Hey!
Rossiter, Langley,
Miss Lucchesi,
My old friend, Tony Moreno.
Hello.
HI. Charmed.
 Italiana?
 Si, di Napoli.
Lei?
 Io sono diMilano.
Hmm, Bene.
Are you looking for something special, or are you just browsing?
You ever serves on these?
Only on the engines.
Anybody go down on one of these is crazy.
How about you?
Submarines.
Officer?
Check.
Senior grade.
Do I salute?
Nope, not in this outfit,
But we got a chain of command.
He gives the orders, and we jump.
Nice to have you with us, Moreno.
Yeah.
What do you think of him, Mark?
How did you say he got that D. D.?
The discharge?
He hit the superior officer with a wrench.
Almost killed him.
Is that all?
Ha!
Hope he can work under pressure.
Not too much pressure, mind you.
After all, what are we asking him to do?
Just to get the engines going so we can holdup a liner.
That's not asking too much.
Not too complicated.
Let's go to work.
Gaskets will have to be replaced.
You'll need all new indicators.
Gears look like they're in good shape.
The clutch is frozen.
We'll have the repack the whole thing.
I've got new packing coming,
A blowtorch, too.
You'll need it.
I hope the shafts are not rusted away.
The mountings, fittings, surfaces are all corroded.
The same goes for the compressor and the pumps.
I'll need at least 10 days-- repairing, improvising, patching up.
Maybe some reinventing.
You want my my honest opinion?
Well, yeah.
Forget the whole thing.
What's all that about?
Tony, for the moment, just worry about your side of this.
I know you can do this.
Those batteries are going to give us nightmares.
What do you mean? completely gone?
They couldn't light a flashlight.
We could use car batteries for emergency lighting.
We'll have to get a generator, distilled water and acid.
We'll get them.
We still have to pray there's enough lead to take a half charge.
And even then...
Yeah?
Even then?
You'll have to ride the surface most of the time.
You won't be able to keep her down there for more than one hour at a time.
But if it gets us where we want to go...
If?
"The terrible ifs accumulate."
Hmm?
Winston Churchill.
They better do all their accumulating while we're on this dry run.
If those batteries die out 100 miles offshore, we can have a big farewell party on the bottom of the ocean.
Tony, it's still worth the try.
Yeah. Think of the money.
[ITALIAN]
Oh, boy!
Five more minutes of this, and they can put me in a rubber room.
Next time,
I'll stick to galleons.
Oh...
Hey.
Where'd you steal that
Huh?
What do you mean by that?
Nothing, nothing it's just an expression.
You don't strike me as the Tiffany type.
The world's full of surprises.
Yeah.
You know, I got a thing for rocks.
Anything shiny, you know.
What about a little shiny sweat on the forehead?
If I want my jewelry appraised,
I'll send for somebody. Move over.
[ENGINE STARTS]
Hear that?
That's what you should be worried about.
Right now they're singing at me... but who knows?
The engines are singing at him.
I love Italians.
They're so damned musical.
Let's knock it off for tonight.
That honest sweat you were looking for-- it' all used up.
I haven't got any liquid left.
Hey, what union you with?
You keep short hours.
What, suddenly you're the foreman?
When I punch out, that's my business.
Why don't both of you shut up.
The temperature's no different over here.
Ahh, let's stop.
It's like an oven.
It's like a nuthouse.
That's what it is, a loony bin-- a happy German, queer for boats,our spaghetti eater,
Mr. Brittain's wino freedom rider, and Mr. Brittain, himself, who I think would sell us out for 25 bucks in hard cash.
Did I forget anybody?
What do we do about him?
Somebody make a suggestion.
I think that'll do itfor this evening, gentlemen.
Mark!
Yeah?
We're knocking it off for tonight. Let's go.
There's still much to do.
Tomorrow night,
Mark and I will dive her right here at less than conning tower depth.
Then we'll fill and blow all the ballasts and pump the trim tanks before we even go out.
When we do take her out of here, we'll surface at night a few times if we have to.
For now, let's all get a little sleep, O.K.?
All right, Rosa.
Let's go.
Thank you.
 Arrivederci.
So silent.
So little to say?
Just tryingto thinkof a rhyme for Rossiter.
He doesn't appeal?
I'm mad about him.
Make allowances,
Mark.
He had a hard beginning--
The slums until 14 years old, then the reformatory.
That would explain his angers, wouldn't it?
I'll try to set asidean hour a day to extend my sympathy.
How many hours a day will you devote?
How many hours at night?
I don't like that, Mark.
There was a time when Victor Rossiter appealed to me-- when he filled a need.
I make no excuses, Mark.
I didn't ask for any.
Rosa?
Are you coming or not?
I was thinking of saving this for the christening, but
I seriously doubt this old tub would survive the blow.
Know something, Mark?
Not very much.
We're digging ourselves a grave here.
Each of us for his own particular reason-- love, loyalty, greed.
The atmosphere is stifling.
It's becoming extremely difficult to breathe.
You want out, Linc?
I signed onfor the duration.
Funny thing, though.
Ever since I went into long trousers,
I've been running away from myself.
I found a hiding place in a bottle.
Where'll I hide after this, Mark?
If we're lucky,
Maybe in a suite at the Waldorf.
You believe that?
I do not.
Drink up, Lincoln.
You've got your problems and I've got mine.
She's so deep in my gut, we breathe together.
[MUSIC PLAYS]
What time is it, please?
Quarter to 2:00.
Freshen it up?
Just more ice, thank you.
Well?
Well, come on, Eric.
What happened?
She's ready.
Well, so far, so good.
Yeah, and that calls for a nice, tall drink.
Hey, Rosa.
Oh, Linc.
It wasn't what you'd call a maiden voyage, but our lady went under 12 feet without a leak.
And everyone's all right?
As Mark says, 4-0.
Same again?
Please.
For me, too, no ice.
How did your little shopping trip go?
Two of them?
Just what we need.
Linc...
You were in the British navy, no?
Wireless operator on a cruiser.
How long have you known Mark?
Quite some time.
He recreated me.
I'd been ill.
He found me lying on the sidewalk one night.
I weighed 104 pounds,
And death was waiting just around the corner.
Mark beat him to it.
He picked me up, fed me.
Shared his clothes with me.
Then taught me to play gin.
I owe him very much, Rosa.
Certainly for my life.
Among this whole motley crew,
I think he has the most substance.
Thank you, Linc.
Right now I think he's looking at the stars.
Linc said I'd find you under the stars.
He sure narrowed it down, didn't he?
What do the stars tell you tonight?
Tonight the stars tell me I'm an idiot.
A gold-plated idiot, for getting mixed up in this thing.
You're not usually afraid, Mark.
Why the second thoughts now?
Do you seriously realize what we're getting into, Rosa?
The minute we set foot on deck of the Queen Mary, we consign ourselves to South America.
But do you think it would be so difficult to livein
Rio De Janerio or Caracus?
Live?
That wouldn't be living, Rosa.
We'd be running and hiding for the rest of our lives.
It's not more wrong now than before.
I didn't hear you say no.
That's because maybe you weren't listening.
Come to think of it,
I wasn't talking.
What held you?
What held me?
A blue-eyed, long legged
Italian with hooks.
That's what held me.
I--I remove them, Mark.
You're free.
You wouldn't con me lady, not again?
You--you never thought you might be important for me, from choice-- and not design?
Well, in that case,
Why don't you drop the other shoe?
Stay a while.
Heave!
[WHISTLING]
What about the explosive?
Well, what about it?
What are you, the floorwalker?
I want to be sure you dump it far enough out so it doesn't float back in.
Don't worry. this is my department.
And weight that warhead with plenty of sea water.
Oh, yes, sir, lieutenant. sir.
Morning.
[ERIC]
Morning, Rosa.
You always look this good in the morning?
You'll have time to compare.
There will be thousands of mornings.
Let's get back to work.
We should be ready to take her out when it's dark.
Hatch secured!
You know what to do with the ballast tanks?
Yes, I know.
Eric?
Yes.
They're running nice and cool.
Good.
Let's take her down.
Remember, all of you.
Don't only look for water, listen for it.
If you hear it, sing out loud and clear.
Did you hear that, Tony?
Right.
Stand by to dive.
Stand by to dive.
Right.
Food them, Rosa.
Pressure in the boat.
Pressure in the boat.
15 degrees dive.
15 degrees.
Victor, check for leaks in the torpedo room.
Right.
8 Meters.
Watch the trim gauges.
Check.
[LINC]
12 Meters.
Level off at 16 meters.
Close the vents, Rosa.
16 meters.
Upperiscope.
She's all dry in the torpedo room.
All dry back there, too.
We are now 50 feet under the surface.
We are dry, breathing, we have eyes.
Gentlemen, and lady, congratulations to us all.
Now what do we do?
Now we go up and talk strategy.
Stand by to surface.
All right, once more.
No, I'm bleary.
Let's pick it up tomorrow.
Hold it, we'll do it once more.
Good.
The day after tomorrow
the Queen Mary sails from New York.
Three nights from tonight,
We'll sail out to a predetermined point, surface, wait for her.
Sailing procedure.
We travel surface at just above negative boyancy-- only the tower up.
We ride the vents, everyone at their stations, so long as we sight no other ships.
But if we do?
Under fast.
Periscope up until their running lights are over the horizon.
Good. Once we get under way, we'll have dry runs on the diving procedure.
From now on until the moment we meet the Mary,
I want every one of you to study the charts.
Come up here.
Remember the deck levels.
Victor, you memorize your route here, from the bullion room to "R" Deck.
Only take as much gold as you can drag.
You've got a long way back.
Mark and I will do the same from the bank to "R" Deck. if the elevator's tied up, we'll try the other side.
If that fails, we'll take the stairs.
This caper sounds less and less possible by the second.
If everyone does his job--
You, Linc and Rosa on the sub,
the three of us on the Mary-- with dispatch and complete accuracy, it is perfectly possible.
O.K.Let's run through the time sequences again.
All right.
At the moment of contact, we'll have 30 minutes to get on the deck, five minutes to board, and for the elevator trip up to the bridge.
Two minutes before sending the dummy torpedo.
15 minutes in the bank-- the same 15 minutes in the bullion room.
Five minutes for us to reassemble on "R" Deck.
Three minutes to depart.
Eric, why all the clock watching?
You're trying for a record? Hmm?
Should you need a reminder,
Only one man on the Mary has to call the bluff.
A cabin boy, a stoker, a 10 year old, but it only takes one.
The longer we're there,
the more chance someone will call the bluff.
Keep in mind we'll be three of us
against all the passengers and crew.
What if somebody does try to use muscle?
I'd like to answer that.
Forget it, kiss it off,, call the whole thing off.
I'm afraid that's correct.
Victor, we must begin your accent immediately.
Now, wait a minute that's the one big snag.
I'm not sure I can pass myself off as an Englishman.
Leave that to Linc.
Who?
Linc.
He's the only one
who speaks
EnglishEnglish.
What time does school start?
Tomorrow morning,
8:00 sharp.
Be a good boy and bring teacher a nice shiny watermelon.
[VIC]
Good night.
Rosa?
YEAH?
Stay on bands three and four.
Eric.
School's open again,
Mr. Rossiter.
Shall we try it?
O.K., let's try it again.
When you arrive on the bridge, what's the first thing you say?
[ENGLISH ACCENT]
Commander Cunningham presents his compliments and wishes to express his sincere thanks.
And?
And I want to personally extend my gratitude to you sir.
Very good.
What is the name of your ship?
the HMS Trident.
And if the captain notices that your submarine looks strange?
UH-UH. SORRY, SIR.
Admiralty orders.
Top secret.
Rather hush hush and all that, you know.
Not exactlyOxonian, but you'll pass.
What is your name?
Lieutenant--
 Leftenant.
Oh, damn. Leftenant.
You must remember that.
Right, right.
That's important.
Leftenant. Leftenant.
Tony, it's your watch.
Leftenant,
Leftenant,
Leftenant.
Hey.
Hmm?
Rememberit's Leftenant.
Listen, he can't even speak English.
Are you having kippers instead of spaghetti, now?
How are the batteries?
They're old and tired, but they should be charged up in an hour.
 You are relieved.
Want some coffee?
Yeah, thanks.
Tell me something, Tony.
How'd you get the navy cross?
Sheer raw courage and devotion to duty.
I believe you.
Ha. Well, don't
Why?
Me and the navy got divorced.
I like the ships and the water all right, but the brass and the braid didn't sit.
I got tired of saying "Yes, sir", to fraternity boys who'd done all their sailing in a bathtub.
Didn't Lauffnaur tell you?
I shaved an ensign's skull with a wrench.
You didn't answer my question--
How did you get the medal?
Just swam out, pulled some guys into a raft after we hit a mine.
Not one of them was over the rank of seaman first.
Boy, you got no idea how I hate the navy.
I'll see you get relieved.
Hey, you were a lieutenant, weren't you?
Correct.
Get me anothercup of coffee.
Aye,aye, sir.
[WHISTLING]
You got a bayonet to go with that thing?
Be prepared.
Thay's my motto.
That motto belongs to the Boy Scouts.
Can I get a merit badge for blowing out one of your eyeballs?
That'll do it.
You don't need the gun, and I don't need the argument.
Why don't you make your choice?
I'm used to failure.
I'm quite philosophical about it.
But to lose because two idiots share the same passion and are willing to kill over you.
This I can't live with!
Do you likethe choice made public now, Commander?
You think that this is the time?
Rosa, we owe you a lot, but tell your two friends this is the Atlantic ocean.
It is adequate for burials, but it is no field of honor.
If they want to duel over you, tell them to wait until I've satisfied my passion!
Running lights off the starboard bow!
Stand by to dive!
Dive!
A tanker.
A big, fat tanker.
12,15 knots and deep in the water.
We could blow her apart with just one torpedo.
Dead amidships.
Just one torpedo.
That's your pleasure, Eric, to sink a big, fat, tanker?
My training, Mark.
My instinct.
Did you say 18, 36.4?
Correct.
Then that's it.
Is that the end of the line?
Unless the sun lies and I've forgotten my navigation, we're here.
Tell Mark stop the engines.
You know,
I'm going to get you a big, big brother--Yeah!
[WHISTLING]
We're here, Linc.
Rosa, get the uniforms ready, Subito.
We're ready to submerge in about an hour.
Make it longer.
Those batteries can't last forever.
We've a long trip back.
From now on, keep changing bands.
You're bound to pick up her transmissions or messages to her.
She can't be too far away from us now.
This the one?
50 pounds of flash powder, but she'll make as much noise as the atomic bomb.
Be sure she runs shallow so everybody sees her.
I can't wait to see their faces when this hits.
Never mind their faces.
Just make sure our watches synchronize with Tony's.
Two minutes after we reach the bridge,
He'll fire this torpedo.
[LINC] I'm getting her loud and clear!
 HMS Trident,
British submarine,
calling Queen Mary.
 HMS Trident,
British submarine,
calling Queen Mary.
Please reply with an extremely low-strength signal.
We're on a secret mission here.
 HMS Trident
Calling Queen Mary.
Aha.
Gentlemen, the Queen.
Gentlemen, we're in the wrong clothing.
HMS Trident callingQueen Mary.
We do not wish our presence revealed.
This is important.
We urge that you call your captain before replying.
Repeat--Urge calling your captain before replying.
Get the Captain.
HMS Trident callingQueen Mary.
Get the Captain. Urgent!
 HMS Trident calling Queen Mary.
We're a British submarine on a secret mission.
This is the Captain of the Queen Mary.
Who are you?
Your name and rank, please.
Low-strength signal!
They're playing along!
This is Commander
Cunningham, Sir.
Commanding the British submarine
Trident.
We're an experimental submarine on a secret mission on these waters under Admiralty orders.
One of our main engines has broken down, Sir.
We need a part
Which we believe your engineers can supply.
I urgently request permission to board, Sir.
Board?
You're asking me to stop my ship?
I'm afraid I must,
Sir.
I cannot overemphasize the importance of my mission, Captain.
It is absolutelyimperative that we have help, Sir, and equally imperative that we have it secretly from a British ship.
We've been waiting on your course for three days, submerging at sight of other ships.
We will delay you
No longer than 20 minutes at the most.
We are on Admiralty orders and request permission to board, Sir.
Very well, Commander,
But you'd better know what you're doing.
We'll stop and lend assistance if we can, but this will be reported to the Admiralty as soon as we dock.
Of course, Sir, and I'm deeply grateful.
May I further request radio silence concerning our presence here?
We do not wish to interfere with your normal transmissions, Captain, but you will request your operators to refrain from mentioning our presence here.
I have already done so, Commander.
Do you have a small boat you can board?
Yes, Sir, we have a raft.
Our chief engineer and two officers will set out immediately.
See that you do.
Gentlemen...
Mr. Lawrence.
Sir?
All engines full astern.
Mr. Porter, go down to "R" Deck and escort the boarding party to the bridge.
Mr. Stewart.
Tony, Linc will help you load the torpedo.
Remember, no mistakes.
She's preset and aimed.
Don't fiddle with the mechanism.
Come on.
Be careful.
Please.
Miss Lucchsi... why the hell didn't you stay in Naples?
Let's go.
Easy, easy.
Good.
This elevator, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Where to, Sir?
Sun deck, please.
Very good, Sir.
Sorry abut the delay.
That's quite all right.
I hope we have just what you need.
I'm sure you do.
Thank you.
They're on a boat deck.
Commander Cunningham presents his compliments and wishes to express his sincere thanks.
Thank you, your name, Sir?
Lieutenant Follett, Sir, and we're extrem--
We're extremely grateful.
Ahem.
 Lieutenant Follett, is it?
That's right, Sir. and are you a British sub?
That's correct, Sir.
HMS Trident.
You're Canadian, aren't you?
Why, yes, Sir.
I'm surprised you could still tell, Sir.
I've been in the Royal Navy just under four years now.
I see. Now about this part you need,
Leftenant,
I hope it won't delay us too long.
No, of course not, Sir.
Captain, I wonder if we might speak with you, privately?
Our mission...
This way, please...
Thank you.
Now, what can I do for you, gentlemen?
I have a schedule to meet.
Would you kindly read this?
"Maintain normal radio transmission."
"Make announcement to pacify passengers and crew."
"Lower a ship's boat."
"Do not interfere with us in any way."
"Open the bank and bullion room"?
Mm-hm.
Do you intend to rob this ship?
Exactly.
Are you insane?
If you'll just follow the instructions--
Now, Eric.
Captain, will you look to our submarine?
That was a dummy torpedo, Captain.
The rest of them are live.
I don't believe you.
Sink this ship, and you sink with her.
That's true.
You've read our instructions.
If you don't follow them,
I advise you to abandon ship.
Gentlemen.
Mr. Lobley?
Sir?
Attend to the radio as per instructions.
Yes, Sir.
Mr. Long?
Sir.
Make the necessary announcement.
Yes, Sir.
And, Captain, if you'll please detail someone
To take three rather large empty sacks to the bank.
Makeit an order with no explanation. Hmm?
You're out of your minds.
You're completely out of your minds.
Do as he says.
Yes, Sir.
Give these keys to the Master-at-Arms.
I commend your wisdom.
It's taken care of, Sir.
Mr. Porter and Mr. Stewart will escort you.
The Captain requests the following information imparted to passengers and crew members.
We've been boarded by members of a British submarine for military purposes.
There's no cause for alarm. and we shall be under way shortly.
Excuse me , Sir, you ordered three sacks?
We did.
Master-at-Arms.
Sir?
Come with me please.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Stand aside.
Captain's orders.
Open it up.
I beg your pardon?
Open it up.
Don't interfere.
What is going on?
Open it up.
What is it?
The Queen Mary, Sir.
She's dead in the water.
Any radio message?
No, Sir.
Nothing at all.
Contact her.
Ask if she requires any assistance.
Aye, aye, Captain.
15 minutes.
O.K.
Whoops.
You two fellas want to give me a hand?
Nah,
I didn't think so.
Out of the way!
Lets go.
Out of the way.
All right, out of the way now.
That's it.
Mr. Lobley.
Sir?
Lower the ship's boat and take it aft to the accommodation ladder.
Yes, Sir.
Well?
Oh, nothing, Sir.
I was just wondering.
I know. You were just wondering why we don't overpower them, take their uniforms and lead a boarding party against that filthy submarine.
Something like that, Sir.
I'd give a year's pay to be able to do it... call their bluff... but I cannot endanger this ship.
I cannot, and I will not.
The junior officer, in a hurry.
Mr. Conroy.
Sir?
Captain...
We contacted her...
She requested we stop transmitting, then broke off.
All ahead full.
All ahead full.
Aye, Sir. All ahead full.
Steady as she goes.
Aye, Captain.
Steady as she goes.
[LINC]
Sunrise cslling
Buccaneer.
 Buccaneer, this is Sunrise.
 Come in. Come in.
Yes Sunrise this is Buccaneer.
Something funny happening.
 Go on. Go on.
I'm getting something on a close band.
Another ship.
Some kind of code, and then she broke off.
But whoever it came from was close by.
You chaps better hurry up. I mesn it.
Will do.
We got company.
The other side.
Captain...
What do they say?
Well, they uh...
They what?
What is it?
They're being held up by a submarine.
Ask them to repeat the message.
Yes, Sir.
Captain.
Well?
"We are being held up by a submarine."
Sound General Quarters.
General Quarters.
Aye, Sir.
General Quarters.
[BELL RINGS]
Back up, please.
Out of the way.
Stand aside, please.
[WHISTLES]
Let me see that, will you, lady?
I beg your pardon.
Oh, no! Help!
No! No!
No, don't shoot!
[GUNSHOT]
[GUNSHOT]
Shove off!
Whoever they are, they're coming fast!
Here they come.
Come on!
Come on!
It's a patrol boat!
Let's get below.
How close is he?
He's gaining.
Stand by to dive.
What?
Dive? What about this stuff?
Shut the hatch.
Mark, he's going to dive.
Come on!
What's the matter with you?
You were going to leave us up there.
We've got to get out!
Stand by to dive.
Where is Victor?
He's dead, Rosa.
Open the vents...now!
Dive!
Level off at periscope depth.
Right.
Mark, take a look.
A Coast Guard cutter.
What about her armament?
She's got a few popguns.
They can make holes in us.
Not to mention the depth charges.
Mark, take the wheel.
Bow and stern.
Planes.
Full dive!
Stay on that course.
Check.
Level off at 25 meters.
We sare moving under the Queen.
[SONAR PINGING]
They've found us.
[SONAR PINGING]
How far behind schedule are we?
Almost an hour, Sir.
We'll get underway.
Signal the cutter to stand by.
Yes, Sir, Mr. Conroy.
Sir.
Left full rudder.
Left full rudder.
Hold it.
[SONAR PINGING]
Slow to 1/3.
[TONY]
Slow to 1/3.
[ENGINE RUMBLES]
We're close.
Very close.
That cutter is probably plotting our position and course right now.
What do we do?
They'll be dropping depth charges.
Not while we're this close
to the Queen they won't.
When the Queen moves off, we can expect it then.
They'll catch us.
One way or another, they'll catch us.
Sonar has them still under the Queen Mary.
Well, we'll just wait on her.
We got plenty of time.
You keep your guns trained on that spot.
What if they're too close?
We'll ram her.
Eric, the batteries are running down.
We're going to have to surface.
Well, we have no alternative.
What the hell does that mean?
Quite simple.
We'll have to torpedo that cutter.
Torpedo her with what?
Tony.
Torpedo her with what?
You've got live fish in those tubes, haven't you?
You've got live torpedoes in there.
Yeah, they're live and ready to fire.
We'll surface. reverse course.
Give her both torpedoes.
You read him? he wants you to sink that ship.
What difference does it make?
That's s United States
Coast Guard vessel.
When my head's on the block,
I shut my eyes.
Keep your eyes open.
We're not going to sink that ship.
[ENGINE RUMBLES]
[SONAR PINGING]
What is that?
That's the Queen.
She's stirring.
She's getting under way.
Grab on to something.
Come on. Over here..
Hold on.
Ohh!
Surface.
Blow all the ballasts!
Left full rudder.
Steady on course.
That'll give us a good shot to miship.
Wait a minute.
You can't do--
Stay right there,
Mr. Brittain.
Steady on 2-2-0.
Hold it there.
Tony, stand by to fire!
[GUNSHOT]
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Fire on those torpedoes!
Aah!
On deck.
Get up there.
Tony.
Tony.
Stand by to ram!
Stand by to ram!
[SIREN]
Aah!
Captain, empty life raft-- there.
Yeah, I see it.
Give me 3/4 full on the original course.
AYE, CAPTAIN.
3/4 full on the original course.
We'll crisscrossfor a while in that direction
My guess is they all bought it, Sir.
Yep.
O.K., climb in.
[SHIP'S HORN BLOWS]
Greatest heist in the world, and we wind up with this.
We almost made it.
Sure.
We're alive, Mark.
Be thankful for that.
Exit the gracious Queen.
Here, start paddling.
South America is that way.
[SHIP'S HORN BLOWS]
Ladies and gentlemen...
...you are about to witness the most spectacular feat...
...ever attempted by the greatest daredevil in the world.
The Great Leslie.
He will be strapped in a straitjacket before your very eyes...
...and lifted up into the clouds...
...where eagles soar and no sparrow dares to venture.
Hey, bull's-eye.
There's a hole in the balloon.
- He'll never make it.
- He'll never make it.
- A parachute.
- A parachute.
A parachute!
A parachute!
What?
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness a feat...
...so dangerous that only one man would dare attempt it.
The Magnificent Professor Fate.
Attach the hooks.
The professor will defy death as his assistant...
...swoops down from the sky, snares the professor...
...on the ground and lifts him into the air.
Contact.
Switch on.
Up, Max! Bring it up!
Coming up.
Max, up, you idiot! Up!
She's up!
Up, you idiot, up!
Too much weight.
I'd like to see The Great Leslie try that one.
After today you will have broken every existing speed record.
What are your future plans?
That depends on my success today.
Gentlemen, will you excuse me please?
Be careful, you idiot, you'll blow us both to kingdom come.
He's getting in the boat.
- You sure you tested the mechanism?
- It can't miss.
All you have to do is throw this switch, it homes in on the loudest engine noise.
You see, it's picked up Leslie's boat!
Farewell, Leslie.
Away.
Golly!
Look at the pretty face on that...
Get away from there.
I intend to cover the measured mile in approximately twelve seconds.
Activate the rockets.
One hundred and fifty!
Two hundred and fifty!
- I'll go down in history!
- Three hundred.
They'll erect a monument to me!
I've done it!
- Professor? Professor?
- What?
Well, there's another one Leslie can try on for size.
Gentlemen.
I've requested this meeting in order to make you a proposition.
In my opinion your company manufactures the finest automobile in the world.
The automobile represents progress, in the most profound sense of the word.
The ultimate example of American ingenuity and enterprise.
This great nation cannot take a back seat to competitors like Daimler...
...Mercedes, Napier, Rolls-Royce,
Dietrich or Panhard.
Gentlemen, I propose to prove that the American automobile...
...your automobile, is without peers.
And just how do you propose to prove that, sir?
A race.
Really, sir, you surprise me.
Automobile races are becoming most commonplace.
I mean, a long race. A very long race.
Buffalo to Albany? It's been done.
Chicago to Cleveland? That's been done.
New York...
...to Paris?
You must build an automobile to the most precise specifications.
Absolutely no!
For a company of this repute, a great company the likes of this one...
...entrusting its entire automobile future to a man like Leslie, it's disreputable.
A cheap carnival performer, a fraud, a trickster.
Help! Don't! A madman!
I apologize.
I thought you were someone else.
Pulling it out by the roots. I warned you.
The madman. Did you see him trying to pull my beard out by the roots?
Leslie will lose!
Your automobile will lose! I will win!
He jumped!
I shall build the greatest automobile in the world and I shall win!
Okay, Professor.
This time it will not be Leslie.
It will be I, Professor Fate!
Fate the Magnificent!
And it is with no little pride that the Webber Motor Car Company...
...unveils its latest and greatest achievement.
Gentlemen, behold the motor car of the future!
Holy cow!
Holy Toledo, look at that car!
Yes, it's quite a car.
- I never saw a car like that in my life.
- You never will again either.
Give me the bomb.
Professor, be careful.
After you activate the mechanism, you only got ten seconds.
I know that. Give me the cord.
We have taken the liberty of naming it after the man who inspired its creation.
- The Leslie Special.
- I'm deeply honored.
What took you so long?
I had to go to the Rolls-Royce agency.
I had to steal a spare magneto.
It's ready.
Yes, it's ready.
There has never been anything like this.
- Professor, your greatest creation.
- The work of genius.
The finest parts from the greatest automobiles in the world.
The Hannibal Twin 8.
When the blizzards and snow storms come, we will continue on just as planned.
Push the button, Max.
When the rains come, and when the snow melts...
...we shall continue to rise above it.
Push the button, Max!
Nature will chase us, we will beat her.
And brigands, thieves, cutthroats of all nations may hound us.
But we are ready for them.
We will blast them to kingdom come!
We can melt, we can blast.
We can rise above! We are invincible!
Take us down.
Push the button, Max.
Yes.
- Mr. Goodbody.
- What is it, Frisbee?
- You have to come.
- What's the matter?
Well, it's a young lady, sir.
- What about the young lady?
- She's handcuffed herself to the door.
- Handcuffed herself to the door?
- Of the men's room.
What?
Gentleman!
Return to your assignments.
This is a newspaper office.
There will be no lollygagging in this hallway.
There will be no lollygagging in this hallway.
Now, young lady, who are you?
I am a female past the age of consent.
I'm the first woman to edit the newspaper at my college.
I'll remain handcuffed until I'm the first female reporter of The New York Sentinel.
Over my dead body.
Unlock those handcuffs and get out.
I will unlock the handcuffs when you give me the job.
Never!
- Never?
- Never.
But, sir, if she remains here, handcuffed to the men's room.
You men may use the washroom on the next floor.
- They can't keep running upstairs forever.
- They can until you get hungry.
That would make a story for your competition.
Woman starves to death in the men's room of The New York Sentinel.
- You wouldn't dare.
- I would dare anything for women's rights.
- Give me an assignment. If I fail, fire me.
- You're fired.
Frisbee, post a bulletin.
Suffragettes are not permitted.
- Let me cover the great race.
- It's covered by experienced reporters.
No, I mean really cover it.
From start to finish, mile by mile.
Reporters are not permitted on the trip, only contestants. Those are the rules.
We run a newspaper, not a school for revolutionaries!
Enter the race. Enter your own car.
We are running a newspaper, a newspaper, not an automotive agency!
Are you afraid of losing?
Give me the money and I'll enter the race.
I despise suffragettes.
I am not just trying to get the vote for women.
I'll emancipate them from the drudgery of being servants or saints.
Out of the laundry rooms and off the pedestals!
You're mad, young woman, you're mad!
And you, sir, are a slave to your puritanism.
Does your wife wear silk stockings?
- I won't discuss such an intimate subject.
- She does, and they're very expensive.
But has she raised her skirts for you and shown her calf?
A woman's leg in a silk stocking can be quite alluring.
Maggie Dubois.
You've never seen a woman's leg in a silk stocking.
Never, never in your whole life.
Frisbee, leave the room!
What are you thinking?
There isn't anything men and women can't discuss when civilized and mature.
And emancipated.
- Anything.
- You can't discuss it. That's the problem.
Women have to emancipate themselves in order to emancipate men.
So they can emancipate each other where it counts the most.
Fifty dollars for every exclusive story
I send back...
...and a hundred dollars for every photograph.
You're a fine man.
A timid man, but a worthwhile one.
Have a cigar.
Don't smoke?
The Sentinel will scoop the world!
Man the helm!
Aye, aye, sir.
- Up periscope!
- Up periscope!
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
I don't know what she's doing here, boss.
She says she's a woman with a mission.
But I think she's a spy for Professor Fate.
You're not suggesting I'm the first woman to ever seek an audience with Great Leslie.
I'm simply Leslie and I'm at your service.
I'm rather thirsty.
Do you have something cold?
I have champagne.
- Down periscope.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Up, idiot! Up, up!
I got you.
There's something wrong with the mechanism.
Down, you idiot!
Release your feet. Release your feet!
- You have to be careful...
- You've got a brain the size of a carbuncle.
Get out of here before Leslie spots us!
Dive, crash dive!
Help!
Wait. Professor!
I'm a reporter.
A reporter?
You disapprove?
No. Let's say I'm a bit surprised.
Let's be honest and say you disapprove.
A woman doing a man's job is competitive, both sexually and economically.
You want to know why I'm here.
I want to report the race and be in it.
It's as simple as that.
Well, it's hardly that simple. But...
...let's discuss it, shall we?
Let's discuss the whole thing completely.
Right from the beginning.
Do you want a wife, a companion?
Or just a woman?
There are certain things we shouldn't discuss.
Why? Men discuss their relationships with women.
Gentlemen don't.
But I'm not a gentleman. I'm a woman.
Indeed you are.
Then say it. What's expected of me?
I'm an emancipated woman and you're an emancipated man.
There are things that should remain implicit between men and women.
Why?
It's been this way for years and I see no reason to change.
- I am a creature of habit.
- All the more reason.
Now you're using your female attractiveness as a weapon.
Equality, real equality of the sexes bothers you, doesn't it.
I can speak, read and write Russian,
French and Arabic.
Yes, so can I. Plus five other languages.
- I can drive any car there is.
- So can Hezekiah.
I won the
Woman's International Competition.
En garde.
Very well.
Now if you'd won the
Men's International Fencing Competition...
Now, we'll talk this out.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Hezekiah, see Miss Dubois to her horse please.
You're afraid!
You're afraid of a real woman!
I'll show you! I'll enter the race myself.
I'll enter my own car and I'll beat you!
And another thing...
Professor, dinner is served.
Who is it?
I wish to see Professor Fate.
I'm a reporter. For The Sentinel.
Beat it, little girl, or I'll sic the dogs on you.
Who was that?
- Kids, just kids, more kids.
- Stupid kids.
You want me to feed you?
Listen to that!
Out back by the garage.
The car! Hurry up!
Help!
Help!
- You sure you locked the door?
- I'm positive. Professor, be careful.
If you open the door one inch, it sets off the alarm.
Help!
Get away! Get away!
Help! Get me down!
Go away.
You idiot.
Get me down! Help!
Get me down! Please!
Out! And stay out!
You can't treat me that way!
I'll expose you!
Out! And stay out! A pox on you!
I don't care. You beast of a turncoat!
What are you kicking the professor for?
Put up your dukes! Come on!
You're a lunatic! A lunatic!
You can't talk to me that way!
I'm a member of the press.
Get off the car, please.
Will you just get off the car?
Hands off the car. Get away from there.
Keep your hands away from there.
Get off of the car! Get away from the car.
- Get away from there!
- Hold it.
That's it.
Away from the car!
Hold it.
That's it.
- Everything is ready?
- Everything is ready.
Hold it.
Just stay away from the automobile.
I'll sign it for you.
I checked everything over twice.
We're ready to go.
Look, buddy, will you please step to one side like a good boy?
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm an official entry.
- Representing The Sentinel.
- What?
Since it is my job as a reporter to be there when the first car crosses the finish line...
...it will be necessary for me to win.
Imagine that crazy female!
She won't even get as far as Albany in that Steamer.
Don't bet on it.
That's a very determined young lady.
Good morning, Hester.
Have a cigar?
I want to thank you again for this opportunity, Mr. Goodbody.
I had little choice after your conversation with my wife.
Henry, if you can't be more gracious, shut up!
- It's a great day for the cause, Maggie.
- It is indeed, Hester.
Drivers, to your cars!
- Hezekiah.
- Boss.
All right, Max.
- Good luck, Maggie.
- Thank you.
Max!
- Come on, Max!
- All checked.
Are you sure you took care of everything?
Just keep your eye on car number 2.
Now, at approximately the 50 mile mark, car number 3, it loses its transmission.
And in about five seconds, car number 4 bites the dust.
Genius, Max, positive genius.
What's next?
- Car number 5, the engine falls out.
- Car number five?
Max! We're number 5.
That shouldn't happen to number 6.
I fixed it so the wheels would come off.
Smoke! Get the fire extinguisher!
- I got the extinguisher!
- Get the extinguisher!
Coming through. I got it.
I think we got it in time. I think we got it!
I think we got it now, Professor.
Okay, she's out.
Where are you?
- Where are you?
- To your right.
Hold it.
That was a pigeon.
- Get the bird.
- Yes, sir.
- Come here, bird, just come here.
- All right. Hurry up, will you, Frisbee?
Frisbee, just get the bird.
Don't lollygag out there, just get the bird.
I got him. I got him, sir.
- Frisbee.
- Yes, I got the bird.
Just hold it. Frisbee. Just be quiet.
Yes, sir. Oh, help me, sir.
Oh, please try to save me, sir.
Just be steady, Frisbee.
Just be steady. Be quiet now.
And it's organizations like The Sentinel that we must deal with first.
Why, at this very moment the editor sits behind his desk...
Frisbee, next time be more careful.
If you're falling, let go of the bird.
"Sentinel car takes lead approximately
600 miles west of Chicago."
Frisbee!
Well, that should put us about here.
Farewell.
Hezekiah, see what's wrong with her car.
- I must have fainted.
- Perfectly natural in this heat.
- Thank you for stopping.
- My pleasure.
May I offer you some water?
No, I'm much better now. Thank you.
- Hezekiah, can she be fixed?
- Not a chance, boss.
Well, I guess that's the end of that.
I know how disappointed you must be.
But it's amazing that you were able to accomplish what you did.
You mean amazing because I'm a woman.
The Steamer is a fast, sporty, attractive automobile...
...designed for city driving and country picnics.
You're lucky it didn't blow up on you.
You know, it's really amazing that anyone was able to go this far. I congratulate you.
Not as a woman, but an intrepid autoist.
You mean an intrepid woman autoist.
A rather dubious honor when you consider that the accomplishment is predicated...
...on the fact that you chose the wrong automobile.
But the choice was not mine.
My editor, a man, made the arrangements.
Your editor is something less than an authority on automobiles.
But you, on the other hand, claim full knowledge of the auto and its workings.
So, being a woman, you chose to ignore the practical evidence, acted emotionally...
...entered the race knowing full well that you couldn't possibly finish.
Oh, I'll finish.
May I ask how?
No, you may not ask how, but I'll finish.
I may not still be an official entry...
...but I will report every foot of this race.
- I'll get another car.
- From where?
If I don't, I'll get something else.
I'll find a way, even if I have to walk.
What are you waiting for?
Every minute wasted is another mile for Professor Fate.
We'll take you as far as Boracho, where I pick up some gasoline.
- Perfect.
- From there, you're on your own!
Thank you. My luggage, please.
Hezekiah, the young lady's luggage please.
Indian attack! We're being attacked!
Smoke screen, Max!
Give them the smoke screen!
No, you idiot! The smoke screen!
Push the button, Max!
Smoke screen!
Get it down! Get it down!
Take cover, you fools, take cover!
Indians! Savages!
Indian attack!
Get a posse! Savages behind us!
- Help!
- Savages attacking us! Indians!
Take cover!
Welcome to Boracho.
Yes, thank you.
Indians, savages attacking us!
- Right behind us. An attack!
- What's funny?
That was just the sheriff and some of the men dressed up like Indians.
- Why, they rode out to welcome you.
- That's very reassuring, Mr. Mayor.
Now if you will just show us where the gasoline is, we'll be on our way.
You understand every second counts.
- You can't go now.
- What do you mean we can't go now?
You're the guest of honor.
Well, I don't want to be a guest of honor.
I got to present you with this here key to the city!
He doesn't want a key, he wants gas!
- As Mayor of Boracho, l...
- I want gas and I want it now!
- You ain't gonna get no gas till tomorrow!
- Tomorrow.
You're gonna accept this here key.
You're gonna attend that meeting tonight...
...or, by jumped-up Harry, you're gonna be guest of honor at a necktie party!
Necktie?
Well, what kind of cheap present is that?
Listen to me, you cheap, mealy-mouthed, third-rate war healer!
- Somebody get me a rope.
- You want a rope?
I got a rope in the car.
Somebody get me a rope!
Hurry up, they're leaving.
Oh! Get me a rope, somebody!
Get me a rope!
- You gonna give us any trouble?
- I beg your pardon.
We been planning this here shindig for over a week.
Now do we string up the bunch of you or cooperate and be the guest of honor.
I greet you with cordiality and good cheer.
It's a pleasure to be the great honor.
It's a big celebration tonight.
You ain't gonna get no gas till tomorrow.
We look forward to celebrating and the hospitality of your community.
Quiet! Citizens of Boracho! Quiet!
Citizens of Boracho. Thank you.
As Mayor of Boracho, I offer a toast...
...to our guest of honor, The Great Leslie!
To the fair city of Boracho.
Now here she is...
...the Queen of the West,
Boracho's own Lily Olay!
- I spotted the gas!
- Shut up.
Howdy, Mayor. Howdy, Sheriff.
Hello, there, Curly.
Hello, there.
Lily, this here's our guest of honor,
The Great Leslie.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Welcome to Boracho, honey.
Won't you join us?
Just for a minute. Scoot over.
How long are y'all going to be here?
Unfortunately, just for the night.
We have to leave in the morning.
That's a pity.
I would like to propose a toast to Miss Olay.
It's lucky Texas Jack ain't around.
He'd gun that dude for sure.
Pardon me, Mr. Partner.
Who is this Texas Jack?
Who's Texas Jack?
The roughest, toughest gunslinger in these parts.
Lily is his girl.
- Lily's his girl.
- Terrific!
Honey, your smile is downright painful!
Thank you. Are you a native of Boracho?
I ain't no native, I was born here!
- Mr. Partner.
- Yes.
Where would I find this Texas Jack?
He's got a ranch about eight miles south of town.
I have to get on that moon again.
Don't go away, you hear?
- It's been a pleasure to meet you.
- Welcome to Boracho, honey.
Jack.
Now wait a minute, Jack.
This is a friendly celebration.
Fiddle-de-dee! I don't much like the way you're celebrating.
So you just step back, Sheriff, unless you want to fall back.
Howdy, Jack, honey.
Jack, honey, don't get rough.
He's the guest of honor.
Now just a moment.
I'm afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
As you can see, I am unarmed.
He's unarmed.
- Let's get the gas.
- Not yet.
All right now, everybody stand back and give a man some fighting room.
Now will you give me some fighting room?
My camera!
Citizens of Boracho, stop!
Music, somebody! Start the music!
Citizens of Boracho!
Now will you give me some fighting room?
Jack, honey!
Excuse me, please.
- Now look what you've done.
- Me?
There's the gas.
There's a fight! Fight in the saloon! Fight!
Fight in the saloon! Big fight! Fight!
Fight! There's a big fight in the saloon. Texas Jack! He's drunk!
Max! Max, you idiot, the gas.
Where's the car?
Get the car!
Hey, boss!
Now can I have me some fighting room?
The back is full. I'll put the rest of the gas in the seat.
Leave it? Can't leave it for Leslie.
Leave Leslie to me. Start the car. The car.
Switch on!
My apologies.
The gasoline!
We shall win!
Well, that finishes Leslie.
Oh, no, not Leslie. Never Leslie.
The Great Leslie. He'll think of something, but we'll be in Alaska by the time he does.
I'm offering you a lift.
Or would you prefer an engraved invitation?
- I might consider an apology.
- An apology?
For what?
It's twenty miles back to Boracho.
- You'd never make it.
- Well, that's your fault.
My fault.
I warned you.
I would not be left behind in Boracho.
You left me no choice so I had to stow away in Fate's car.
And he cast you adrift.
If you had provided me with transportation to Grommett...
...where I could have caught a train, it never would have happened.
Grommett was 100 miles out of our way.
And where are you going now?
Professor Fate destroyed all the gasoline,
Grommett is a matter of necessity.
And when you reach Grommett you'll send for gasoline?
But if you were to send for gasoline now it would be in Grommett when you arrived.
If I were to send for gasoline now
I would need a telegraph.
Not necessarily.
I will take you no further than Grommett.
Hey, Professor, where we going?
We save 15 miles by following the tracks, Max.
Oh, terrific!
- Is that gasoline?
- Sure is.
Let me give you a hand with it.
Wait a minute.
- Nobody gets nothing till it's signed for.
- Of course.
- You M. Dubois?
- I beg your pardon.
- Gasoline consigned to M. Dubois.
- What?
- Oh, I'm M. Dubois.
- I knew it.
You got some identification?
What did I tell you?
I told you not to trust her.
My press card.
Okay, just sign on the line.
- What if I don't sign?
- You see.
Look, ma'am, you don't sign, you don't get no gas.
Well, Mr. Leslie?
You wish to continue the race, so do I.
As far as the West Coast?
If she goes, I stay!
Hezekiah.
You going to sign or do I send the gas back to New York?
Miss Dubois, this is very...
The gas is yours if you take me to the West Coast.
Under the circumstances, it's a fair exchange.
Load the gas back on the train.
She's not signing and the train's leaving in five minutes.
Just one moment, please, sir.
I will not leave without Hezekiah.
If I can change his mind?
Suppose you don't change his mind?
Then I shall take this train back to New York.
Sir, let me give you a hand with the gasoline.
Boys, would you care to join me?
Hezekiah, I understand how you feel, but I beg you to reconsider.
A deal is a deal.
Then I guess I'll have to hurry or I'll miss my train. Goodbye, Hezekiah.
You mean...
Well, a deal is a deal.
It's been wonderful knowing you.
What about the gas?
I signed for it.
I'm sorry. You see, this race ain't the right place for a woman.
I understand.
Board!
Well.
- Would you take me to the train?
- Well, yes, ma'am.
Boys and girls, this is a six-cylinder automobile...
...with an overhead cam that can...
It was built by a company especially for me, for this race.
He just wouldn't listen.
I told him, and he said that...
...he's had enough and he didn't think you could win anyway.
And...
...he said he was going to go back to New York.
Double-crossing females!
Hey, boss! Look.
Hey, conductor!
You are trying my patience, madam.
We know our rights.
You're obstructing traffic and disturbing the peace!
- And you are exceeding your authority.
- I ain't exceeding nothing, lady!
- Then, arrest us.
- What?
Arrest us. I dare you.
Sorry, sir.
I want you to run to City Hall and bail out Mrs. Goodbody.
Yes, sir.
In about two hours.
Yes, sir.
I once went on an anthropological expedition...
...to study the Kwakiutl Indians.
In winter, one Kwakiutl in a blanket froze.
But two Kwakiutls in the same blanket...
Yes?
Were warmer.
Would you hold this, please?
Champagne?
You put alcohol in the radiator of the automobile...
...to keep it from freezing, don't you?
I can't see a thing.
Neither can I.
Maybe we better stop.
I can't stand it, I'm freezing to death.
Shut up!
Even the thermometer is frozen.
Everything's frozen.
Look at that!
It won't take long to grow back.
It's only a half of a mustache.
What was that?
I don't know.
Well, I'll go see.
Miss Dubois, please. Thank you.
I'm terribly sorry.
I thought you were Maximillian.
Nothing to worry about. We have a lot more champagne in the car.
Professor!
Yes!
Where are you?
Behind the rock!
Behind which rock?
This rock, you idiot. Come on.
Close the door and hurry it. Bring it up!
We're safe up here.
Yeah, safe here.
Help!
My apologies.
There's a polar bear in our car.
If you don't leave this car immediately,
I shall personally feed you to the bear.
If the bears don't get us, we'll certainly freeze to death out there!
As far as freezing is concerned, you have the same chance that we have.
- Not if you put us out in the blizzard.
- Snowing very bad.
May I point out that you've completely demolished my top.
And there's very little difference between the blizzard out there and in here.
Except that you have blankets and stimulants.
Stimulants.
He's right.
Miss Dubois, you're not suggesting...
If two in a blanket stand a better chance than one...
Then four in a blanket...
He's a cheat and a liar.
That's beside the point.
The point is that we're freezing.
Yes, and the time has come to cast aside our personal differences.
Bury the hatchet.
And you know who has the hatchet.
He doesn't even have a whole moustache...
...so why can't we settle this whole thing underneath the blanket?
We must get underneath the blankets together. Close together.
Therefore, it will be necessary to lower the seat.
Lower the seat!
Max, the back!
The foot. Watch that foot!
I beg your pardon.
Champagne, Professor?
Thank you.
Hey, this is terrific.
May I propose a toast?
What's so funny? Something wrong?
What happened to your mustache?
- I broke it off.
- You what?
I broke it off. It was frozen. Look.
What time is it?
Just a moment.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Very big. The head very big.
Time to get up.
Professor, time to get up.
Come on, Professor, rise and shine.
Rise and shine?
- Then you rise, you shine.
- He's always like this in the morning.
- I'm not always like this!
This particular morning
I happen to be seasick.
Too much champagne.
I'm not sick from champagne,
I'm sick from the sea!
- It's not necessary to yell at her.
- I'll yell at whoever I want to yell at!
- He always yells like this.
- Let me out of here!
7:30 in the morning, you idiots, I'm seasick!
Rise and shine.
Help! Max!
I'm coming, Professor.
I got you!
You're wasting your time.
- Perhaps.
- We're melting.
- Slowly.
- We're going to sink.
- Eventually.
- Then you're wasting your time!
I shall place this log...
...in a water-tight container, if found...
...it shall provide valuable information for those who may follow.
Valuable information for those who may follow.
Professor, I got an idea.
Instead of the book, why don't you and me get into the container?
Shut up!
- We got to do something.
- Don't worry.
Before this iceberg melts and we drown like rats, we're going to do plenty.
We're going to starve!
Miss Dubois, I recommend we have cold meals from now on...
...we're melting fast enough as it is.
What difference does it make?
A few hours one way or another.
Minutes have made the difference in survival, Miss Dubois.
Mr. Leslie, I suspect you are being unrealistically optimistic for my benefit.
And it isn't at all necessary.
We're lost on an iceberg, and doomed to drift with the tide and melt.
You're a brave woman, Miss Dubois.
Red sky.
So what?
There's going to be a storm.
What are you talking about?
"Red sky in the morning, sailor, take warning."
You thimble-headed gherkin, do you realize the odds against a storm...
...in this part of the ocean at this time of year? 100-to-1.
Throw me a rope!
"Red sky in the morning, sailor, take warning."
Why you, nincompoop!
Max!
Another foot.
Another foot.
Thirty-seven inches to go.
Thirty-seven inches to go.
At the rate we've been melting that's good for about one more week.
You better keep it to yourself.
Of course I'll keep it to myself.
Until the water reaches my lower lip, then I'll mention it to somebody.
What was the professor complaining about?
You know the professor.
He thinks we're melting too fast, and he was venting his wrath on the gods.
Are we melting too fast?
I don't think so.
According to my calculations...
...we'll reach land just about the time that our feet get wet.
- I'm hungry.
- She's getting it.
How long does it take to open a can of beans?
The eternal struggle takes time, Max.
What struggle? She's got a can opener.
You cork-brain, I'm talking about man, woman, sex, conquest.
What was that?
He's making his move.
And I'm sure she's interested.
But unless I miss my guess she will never submit.
If she does, we won't get any beans.
It's a contest, and he's using weapons that have toppled everything...
...from a Kansas farm girl to a European duchess.
But she will counter with women's rights.
That's terrible.
For a man like Leslie, that's terrible.
Like me, he must win on his own terms.
She recognizes no terms except her own.
Come and get it.
You see?
Maybe she doesn't mean us.
Hey, Professor.
Hey, Professor, up and at 'em.
Up and at 'em?
- It's 7:30. Up and at 'em.
- "Up and at 'em!"
Don't yell!
Always yells like that in the morning.
You idiot!
"Hey, Professor, up and at 'em."
"Hey, Professor, up and at 'em, it's 7:30."
We're underwater!
We're underwater! We're doomed!
- We'll make it.
- We'll make what?
- Land.
- Land!
Land!
It's probably East Cape.
I see a ship in the harbor.
We're saved. We're saved!
Max, we're saved! We're saved!
- I am Professor Fate!
- We're saved!
Max, my trusty trout, the cannon.
Fire the cannon, let them know we're here!
Push the button, Max!
Max!
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Isn't it wonderful to see an American ship in this godforsaken outpost?
It is indeed. It's probably from San Francisco or Seattle.
Ahoy, iceberg.
It's me!
It's me!
If I didn't know better I would say that's...
It's me!
- Hezekiah.
- What?
You gave me your word and I trusted you.
Then you handcuffed Hezekiah to the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe.
It was the Southern Pacific.
What has that got to do with it?
You gave me your word.
- You gave me no choice!
- You lie!
I told you I would finish the race.
- Push the button, Max.
- Are you sure this is such a good idea?
She is his Achilles' heel, she is our ace in the hole.
- She must not be left behind now, Max!
- I know!
Push the button.
But you can't leave me here.
Boss!
We want jobs. We want jobs.
Frisbee?
Frisbee!
Frisbee?
I'm sorry, dear.
- Capitulate, Henry.
- Never.
Well, remember we're having the Simpsons to dinner. Now try not to be late.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry, dear.
I could hardly get across the hall.
Why are you complaining?
I have to sleep with their leader.
This is from Reuters.
"Last report dated March 10.
"Fate's car still in lead and nearing Srednek Kolimsk."
They could have reached the Lena River by now.
- Hey, Professor, what is this?
- Shut up.
You give them beads, makes them friendly.
Obviously, they don't know who I am.
I am professor Fate!
You want to try the beads?
What is the word for "friends"?
- Professor...
- Shut up!
- I don't know this language.
- Get the dictionary.
- I've got it.
- What is it?
I can't pronounce it.
Very simple.
- "Drozia."
- Drozia.
I speak, read and write French,
Russian and Arabic.
Max, stick with the car!
She don't act like she's being kidnapped.
Max!
Boss, this dispatch just came in from Maggie Dubois.
"Have crossed Carpanian border.
"No contact with Leslie's car in nearly three weeks.
"So there's no way of telling who's in the lead."
The Webber Motor Car Company built the Leslie Special.
- Have they integrated yet?
- No.
They still refuse to hire any women.
Until Webber changes its policy, there will be no mention...
...of the Leslie Special in this newspaper.
But you can't do that.
We'll lose their advertising.
Mr. Frisbee, until my husband is released...
...from Happy Acres, I am in charge here.
Yes, sir... Ma'am.
Now, let's see.
They should be approaching the next gasoline stop...
...which is Potzdorf.
I am General Kuhster.
I will escort you to the palace where you will be the guests...
...of His Royal Highness, Prince Hapnick.
We are deeply honored.
Who's Prince Hapnick?
He's the royal heir to the throne.
I say we should've dumped her a long time ago!
I say we shall dump her when I say we'll dump her!
She's playing you for a sucker!
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
What do you want?
Who are you?
Professor Fate. And who might you be?
- Incredible.
- Amazing.
Unhand me.
I found this wildcat swimming in the lake.
I demand to know what this is all about?
It's very simple:
You and your friends are under arrest.
- Will you be in Potzdorf long, Mr. Leslie?
- I'm afraid not.
We leave tomorrow morning. Early.
Where is your competitor, this Professor Fate?
- I suspect not far behind.
- Lf he ain't ahead of us already.
Have you met the Crown Prince yet,
Mr. Leslie?
No, I haven't had the honor.
His Royal Highness,
Crown Prince Frederick Hapnick!
Hey, boss...
- Yeah, but that's...
- No, it isn't.
That was exhausting.
Your Highness!
Your highness, may I present the Great Leslie.
- Your Highness.
- And this is Mr. Hezekiah.
Welcome to Potzdorf.
Excuse me, Your Highness, but do you have any relatives in the United States?
Me? Relatives in the States?
It's of no consequence, Sire.
It's just that you bear...
...an uncanny resemblance to someone we both know.
- Someone who looks like me?
- Yes, sir.
Poor fellow.
May I have the honor of this dance?
In the Kingdom of Carpania if one doesn't waltz...
...one doesn't dance. And I love to dance.
Only problem is, I hate the waltz.
I waltz just enough to comply with tradition...
...then I sneak off to more rewarding activities.
Brandy!
I should have scheduled divine entertainment for you:
Carpania's full of forests.
The forests are full of gypsies...
...and the gypsies are full of shenanigans such as swallowing swords...
...and chewing broken glass, eating fire.
It's wonderful!
I don't know how they do it.
Your Highness should visit India one day.
India, isn't that where they have those Hindu persons walking on hot coals?
And lie on nails!
They train those hideous snakes!
I think I'm supposed to go to India, after I assume the throne...
- Do we go to India, General?
- Yes.
Good, I can hardly wait.
Sit. Here, have a cigar.
The coronation is tomorrow.
I hope you'll stay, you Great Leslie, you.
I'd be most honored, Your Highness.
But if you attend the coronation, won't you lose time in your race to Paris?
Since there hasn't been report
Professor Fate has crossed your border...
...I assume that I'm in the lead.
But he might cross at any moment.
It's been my experience, General...
...that there is little advantage to winning if one wins too easily.
What do you say to that, General?
An admirable point of view.
For anyone, but a soldier.
In my profession, to win is imperative.
To win easily is a blessing.
Yes, blessing. He has terrible mottos written all over his walls like:
"If a good soldier dies with his boots on, rest assured they're polished."
- Good evening, Your Highness.
- Rolfe, you rogue, where have you been?
My apologies for being late,
Your Highness, but I was delayed by...
...some last minute business.
You haven't been dueling again, you naughty boy.
No, Your Highness.
Mr. Leslie, this is Baron Rolfe Von Stuppe.
Baron Von Stuppe, is Carpania's greatest swordsman.
Matter of fact, his prowess with the blade...
...is surpassed only by his reputation with the ladies.
- Baron.
- I'm honored.
Sit and drink up. The evening's young, we're all going to have such a gay...
Brandy! What kept you?
What makes you so great, Mr. Leslie?
Greatness is a light-hearted title for theatrical amusements.
Or a definition endowed on men...
...too long dead to know that its been awarded.
I'm simply Leslie.
And I'm at your service, Your Highness.
Goodness gracious.
You know there's one thing wrong with living in a palace:
It takes so long to get from one place to another.
I live in a constant state of exhaustion.
Poor Prince!
One good thing, when one was young, you could play along the corridors.
I used to ride my pony up and down this corridor when I was young.
Then I grew up and got drunk, and fell off.
I'm going to bed, now.
Good night, Your Highness.
- Who is going to tuck me in?
- I can manage that.
No. You're the sloppiest tucker-inner in all Potzdorf.
If there's anything I abhor, it's a sloppy tucker-inner.
Good night, you good Leslie, you.
Sleep tight and don't let the bedbugs bite.
There, kids.
They've been waiting for me.
Mumsey...
...l'm afraid I had a teeny-weeny bit too much to drink.
But then again, I always have a teeny-weeny bit too much to drink.
Because Mumsey isn't here to scold me.
I wish Mumsey were here.
Hello.
Good night, Mumsey.
Running like a top.
Good mechanics always got to keep checking. Every little thing.
A beautiful machine.
Indeed it is.
And you make sure nobody gets nearer than 50 feet to it, you understand?
Unless of course, it's me or...
...Mr. Leslie.
- Don't worry.
Well, I'll see you in the morning.
Looks like a beautiful night.
I think I'll just take a little stroll around the palace.
Don't make too much noise.
It's a secret.
A secret? I love secrets.
- What's the secret?
- What we're doing, your Highness.
We're going to take you for a little ride.
Good. Where are we going?
For a little ride, your Highness.
In you go.
Speed on.
King, I'm going to be king.
It'll do no good to get the bars out off the windows.
You and your stupid ideas.
Max can't accomplish anything with a pen knife.
And if he could, it's at least a 100-foot drop.
Unhand me! You blackguards, scoundrels!
Unhand me!
I demand to see the American Consul.
You blundering idiots!
You'll answer to my government for this outrage! Outrage!
You have kidnapped me.
Fate the Magnificent!
Let's get practical.
I don't care what you do to the others...
...as long as you let me go.
What do you say to $500?
Professor...
...allow me to present
His Royal Highness, Prince Hapnick.
Heir to the throne of Carpania.
Hi, there.
It's out!
No!
I suggest you reconsider.
I won't do it!
Then you leave us no alternative.
I'll do it.
Don't just stand there, do something.
Hezekiah, please wake up.
Hezekiah?
Please, Hezekiah.
Max!
Open this door!
Max, you little rat! I'll get you for this.
By tomorrow, you'll be king.
After that you declare General Kuhster chancellor and quietly abdicate.
Your Highness, remember one slip and you're dead.
Aren't we all?
Good evening.
When we get back to the palace, you must trim your mustache.
You must look exactly like the prince.
Can you laugh?
What do you mean can I laugh?
- The prince has a very individual laugh.
- Like what?
No, that's much too bass.
The prince is more of a soprano. Try it.
Try it once more.
I demand to know what this is all about.
You've been told. You're under arrest.
I know, but for what?
- Spying.
- Spying?
At last, the Great Leslie is finished.
I've won!
They said I never could. Get off of the bed!
Don't you try any double-crosses, my friend, keep our deal.
He stays in the pokey until I'm safely in Paris.
When it comes to double-crossers, you are looking at the king!
Not until you've trimmed your mustache,
Your Majesty.
I hate you.
I've come to see the Great Leslie.
I'm sorry, Padre,
I can't let anyone see the prisoner...
...without the proper authority.
I understand. Bless you, my son.
Leslie!
I'm here. In here.
- Max!
- We've got to save the professor.
What about Miss Dubois and Hezekiah?
- They're with the baron.
- The baron?
He's got everybody.
We've got to go save the professor.
Stop! Stop!
Escaped?
With a small friar.
Leslie escaped with a chicken?
No, you idiot, with a friar.
A monk. A priest.
What should we do?
The coronation must take place without delay.
With Leslie free, every minute counts.
You're right. With Leslie on the loose, every second counts.
Are you sure that the baron's castle is on a lake?
I'm positive. Great big lake.
And the only lake on this map is straight ahead.
You're not serious?
Deadly serious.
You're a sadistic fiend.
He has only to answer a few simple questions.
Not the mustache.
Why did you come here?
Who sent you?
- Proceed.
- No!
Touch one hair on his head and you'll answer to...
...Teddy Roosevelt and the United States government!
"My country 'tis of thee
"Sweet land of liberty of thee I sing"
That's it. On the lake.
Come on, we'll save the professor.
Maximillian, if Miss Dubois and Hezekiah are not in that castle...
They're there, I swear it.
Come on, save the professor.
They're there. Cross my heart.
Terrific.
What's more, do as I tell you.
Stay down. Down.
"Land where our fathers died
"Land of thy pilgrim's pride from every mountainside
"Let freedom ring"
Shut up, Professor.
They're there.
Here comes the Marines!
Good evening, Baron.
Well, Mr. Leslie.
What a pleasant surprise.
I half expected to see you again, but...
...not with a sword in your hand.
Do you prefer the foil?
Not particularly.
It happened to be convenient.
I presume you know how to use one.
I hope that won't be necessary.
I'm sure you do.
Will you release Miss Dubois and the others?
- No.
- I'm afraid this will be necessary.
You're being very foolish.
That's an assumption, Baron. You make me the victim even before we start.
It's your life.
You're assuming again. En garde.
Very adroit, Mr. Leslie. Very skilled.
My compliments, Mr. Leslie.
You handle the foil very well.
Thank you, Baron. So do you.
Personally, I prefer a man's weapon.
How are you with a saber?
There's only one way to find out.
Surround him!
Look out! Look out!
Oh, the smoke!
Running away, Baron?
As a very wise English gentleman once said:
"He who fights and runs away, may live to fight another day."
So until another day, Mr. Leslie.
Please excuse me. I have a boat waiting.
Faster!
Professor, the jig is up.
Your Highness.
Your Royal Highness.
Your Royal Highness!
Wait, Your Royal Highness! My prince!
Out of the way!
Your Highness.
Your Highness, we've got to get out of here!
You wouldn't dare!
Please!
Wait for me. Wait for me.
- Your Majesty.
- Hi, there.
Brandy!
Throw more brandy.
More brandy.
Brandy. Throw more brandy.
Rum. I never mix my pies.
I want to play, too.
Miss Dubois!
Hey, Professor!
Hey, Professor.
Hey, Professor!
You. You're the cause of it all.
It was your idea.
No, Your Highness.
It was Baron Von Stuppe.
I don't care. You're banished!
I'm getting a new tucker-inner.
Banished, banished!
Miss Dubois!
Hey, Professor!
- Hey, Professor, where are you?
- Right here, you idiot.
Terrific. Let's go. I got the car.
More pies! More pies!
Oh, Leslie! Leslie!
Goodbye. Farewell, you good Leslie, you.
I hope you win. I hope you win!
I'll miss him. Oh, there it is!
General?
E Flat.
I think I better go and fix the car.
- Miss Dubois.
- Yes?
I believe the time has come for us to resolve our differences.
Good.
As you know, I've steadfastly maintained...
...an uncompromising position about women's rights and the equality of sexes.
As have I.
Therefore, it is safe to assume that has been the principal area of our conflict.
No doubt about it.
Therefore, in the interest of progress and harmony...
...I am willing to concede to your point of view.
Concede?
You are an emancipated woman,
Miss Dubois.
And I am an emancipated man.
Come back here.
You are the most unreasonable, inconsistent female...
- I'm unreasonable? I'm inconsistent?
- Yes.
What about you? Talk about inconsistent.
- Inconsistent!
- And unreasonable.
- Unreasonable!
- And arrogant.
- Arrogant!
- Yes, arrogant!
All right, Miss Dubois, let's discuss arrogance for a moment.
All right, Mr. Leslie. Let's.
Any woman who has the unmitigated arrogance to consider herself man's equal.
Any man who has the arrogance to consider himself better than a woman.
- Any fool knows that a woman cannot...
- That's right! Any fool!
- You know what's the matter with you?
- I know what's the matter with you.
What did I tell you?
She's going to win the race for us.
The buffalo-headed vixen!
- I tried to kiss you.
- I know what you tried.
You're the one that's been preaching emancipation.
We're going to win, Max.
We're going to win!
I think you turn right at the next corner.
- You're not talking about equal rights.
- I know what I'm talking about.
You're talking about some convenient feminine utopia...
...that has all of the advantages and no responsibilities.
- Responsibilities?
- Yes!
Look who's talking about responsibilities.
Turn right.
- Go back and turn right.
- We do not turn right.
- I know Paris.
- So do I.
You have to turn right in order to get to the Eiffel Tower.
If we turn right back there, we'd end up on the Montmartre Steps.
You talk a good fight, but when it comes down to it...
...you're as emancipated as a confirmed spinster in a knitting bee.
How would you know?
You're a suffragette. You're the one who wanted to bring sex out in the open.
So I brought it out into the open and
I got slapped in the face for my trouble.
Your interpretation of bringing sex out into the open and mine are two different things.
Well, will you please tell me what your concept of sex is?
Gladly!
You and your stupid map!
She's still with him. You said if she was with him, we couldn't lose.
Shut up!
And because I consider myself sexually free and morally emancipated...
...l'm a responsible, discriminating woman who doesn't intend to jump into bed...
...with the first muscular egocentric male who thinks he can seduce me...
...by agreeing with some of the things
I believe in.
- I only wanted to kiss you.
- Why?
Because I love you, that's why.
- You don't believe me?
- I do not.
- What are you doing?
- Proving that I love you.
You'll lose the race.
Can you think of a better way to prove it?
Max, I won!
- I won!
- We won!
- I won!
- We won!
- I am invincible!
- We won!
I have beaten Leslie at last.
The world is mine!
You lost.
Only the race.
I am king!
I am the king.
No, I'm not! I didn't beat him.
He let me win!
I can't win this way.
I can only win one way:
My way! They let me win!
I can't win your way. You cheated.
You cheated.
You cheated! You cheated!
You cheated. I hate you.
I refuse to accept!
I won't win any way but my way.
You ruined my reputation!
Do you hear? You, I hate!
You with your hair that is always combed.
Your suit is always white.
Your car is always clean.
I refuse to accept.
I challenge you to another race.
- Get off my hood.
- Another race!
Come on, Professor, go!
Come on, go, go!
Relax, this time
I'm going to win it my way.
Push the button, Max!
Done by (c) dCd / November 2007
Emerald, my kingdom for the emerald
For the Topkapi emerald, oh, hallelujah
It can be done.
That's the way it can be done.
Oh! Oh, excuse me.
I've just had a great idea.
Something I've been looking for a long time. A very long time.
Josef, how many times have you been in and out of the country?
Many times, many times.
I should say... Yes, 12 times.
Ever had a problem at the border, at customs?
- Bah! They know me.
- Josef, you're going to be very rich.
Do you like that?
I like that.
It will be some time before
I see you again, Josef.
I will wait for you.
This is...
You don't even know who I am, or where I am.
First, my name is not really Elizabeth
Lipp, but please call me that.
It's convenient.
And I am in Turkey... in Istanbul... in the seraglio.
This is where the old sultans lived.
They had a lot of wives and other treasures, so they made the palace bigger and bigger.
Like each of the buildings here, this little shack contains works of art unique in the world.
The entire seraglio is now a museum... the fabulous Topkapi Museum.
But... but there is one special room.
That's why I'm here. I'll show you.
Come in.
This cradle... pearls, rubies, and pure, solid gold.
This is the famous throne of Shah Ismael.
No king or emperor ever sat on a throne more precious.
From every corner of the earth... gifts made to the Turkish empire.
But I would give you all of them... for just one dagger, encrusted with diamonds and emeralds.
The four greatest emeralds the world has ever known.
Dazzling.
Flawless.
All four are priceless.
But there is one that is perfection.
It has life. It is warm.
It has nerves, senses...
Oh, forgive me.
A strange thing happens to me.
Difficult to explain.
All right.
I'm going to have it.
It's going to be mine.
How?
I didn't finish introducing myself.
I am a thief.
Honest.
Excusez-moi, monsieur l'agent, ou est l'Hôtel George V?
Vous descendez les Champs Élysées et vous prenez l'avenue George V.
- Merci.
- A votre santé, monsieur.
Merci, monsieur l'agent.
Taxi!
A gun is one thing, intelligence is another.
Since I'm more afraid of intelligence...
Hôtel George V. Here.
Up to your old tricks, Walter?
Hello, Elizabeth.
- What brings you here?
- That old magnetism. I was drawn to you.
It took three years to get that old magnetism to work.
- How's the captain?
- Hm?
My successor.
It took three days for the magnetism to wear off.
Seriously?
Seriously.
- Cannibal.
- It's like Chinese food.
One hour, and you're hungry again.
- What do you want?
- You.
- Business? Pleasure?
- So many questions.
Let's go and eat. I am hungry.
- Where?
- My studio.
- Still the same?
- Slight change.
You've lost none of your skill.
- Darling, you too.
- I was talking seriously.
- I, too.
- You're never serious, except when it comes to stealing emeralds.
It's a living.
Well?
It's too tough.
But I'll do it.
- I knew you would.
- On one condition.
- Granted.
- I pick the crew.
- As always.
- Not as always.
This time, with amateurs.
- Amateurs?
- Only amateurs.
- All right, I give up.
- My favourite pupil.
Sit down.
Lesson one... the three cardinal rules of theft.
How Swiss you are. Eins, zwei, drei.
You're right. Eins... plan meticulously.
- Zwei... execute...
- Cleanly.
- Drei?
- Don't get caught before, during...
Or after. That's right.
The Istanbul emeralds... the most protected jewels in the world... have been stolen.
Alarm system.
Check Cedric Page, London.
Cedric Page? What's that?
You will meet him.
Now, the emeralds are gone.
Policemen of the world unite.
You're Scotland Yard, Turkish police... what do you do?
- What do I do?
- You eliminate the riffraff.
Obviously, this is a class job.
You dig out the dossiers on the top professionals, the elite.
How many are they? Not more than half a dozen, and all known.
But, there is no dossier on Elizabeth Lipp... not even Elizavetta Lippmanova... because you have been lucky.
There's no dossier on Walter Harper... not even Walter Haberlee... because I have been efficient.
- What you would call "Swiss".
- Liebling.
So there must be no police record on anyone who works with us.
Where do you find these lily-white innocents?
That's my job.
What do you say?
Amateurs?
Amateurs.
Ah.
He has many children, Cedric Page?
None. These are all his own toys.
- Come, look at this parrot.
- I don't like parrots.
This one isn't real.
I'm beginning to wonder if anything is real.
I'm beginning to wonder if anything is real.
Well you may, dear lady.
Like the old faith healer of Deal who said, "Although pain isn't real, when I sit on a pin and it punctures my skin,
I dislike what I fancy I feel."
I'm Cedric Page. How nice of you to come, Walter, and to bring Miss Lipp.
I see you've met my recording Polly.
Amusing, isn't she?
Oh, very. I hope it won't record all our conversations.
Polly is the soul of discretion.
I never go anywhere without her.
Well, shall we move into my den?
We'll be more private in there.
Come along, Miss Lipp.
My newest toy.
It doesn't work with a ray.
Just the smallest change of temperature, the natural heat of the human body, close enough to it does the trick.
If you had a refrigerated dress, it wouldn't work!
Fortunately, I haven't. I very seldom wear one, especially not in England.
Make yourselves comfortable.
The entertainment is charming.
- Is it all for me?
- I'm a terrible show-off.
But do let me offer you a drink.
- No, thank you.
- How was your trip to Istanbul?
Marvellous! Did you go on the underground railway?
It's the oldest in Europe.
Did you bother to go to the museum, Mr Page?
Well, of course. That was the whole idea, wasn't it? The alarm.
I take my responsibilities in this enterprise seriously, as I'm sure you do, Miss Lipp.
Well, now, let's all go into the museum, shall we?
Here is the door, shall we say?
And Walter... Walter is the sultan... with the dagger.
Miss Lipp?
It was you weight that did it, on the Treasury floor.
Perhaps I should have said,
"Even your weight".
Try again, just one foot.
Well, just the toe.
It's all based on a little chap down here.
This is a delicate strain gauge.
There are hundreds of them under the Treasury, each one connected to the alarm system.
They measure weight... the smallest weight.
Even a ping pong ball.
That's our problem.
Then all you have to do is to find the switch and turn it off.
It could be anywhere, hidden in the walls or the ceiling, operated by remote control a mile away or more.
And how do you propose to get into a museum without touching the floor?
I wouldn't have to touch the floor if I were a fly.
It isn't how I see you, Mr Page.
We have our human fly.
And our human fly holder.
- That's Giulio, that's Hans.
- And...
..we have a sucker!
A sucker?
Yes. You'll catch on.
And we need another kind of sucker, but him we'll find in the north of Greece.
In Kavala, near the Turkish border.
- Yianis, give me my money.
- Tomorrow.
- Young one. No money. Nothing.
- And no groups aboard there?
- Some English.
- English? Open that bag.
Let's have the box. Come on.
Where is it? Oh, ah, there we go.
Yes, the English lay great store by things like this.
I hate to do it myself but, c'est la vie!
Well, wish me luck, Voula.
Ah, Simpson!
So that's Arthur Simpson.
Arthur Simon Simpson... historian, guide, and schmo.
Morning. First time in Kavala, no doubt.
I'm Arthur Simpson, archaeologist and historian.
I dug this up many...
Look, it's still wet.
This harbour's full of historical connections.
Brutus spent the night here before Philippi, after that unpleasant business he had with Shakespeare... Julius Caesar.
Viens, chérie.
Je parle Belgique...
Ceramics, handmade by the descendants of ancient heroes here.
Ah, Reverend!
My name is Simpson, sir.
Arthur Simpson.
I'm Church of England myself.
It's a very religious place.
Do you know St Paul passed through here on his way to Samothrace?
I do.
You'd be surprised to know the amount of people that don't, Bishop.
Mack, want to see the nightlife of Kavala?
You want the belly dancers, stripteasers?
You showed me Kavala nightlife. Remember?
- I'm not expensive...
- No.
- Look work of art!
- I don't want any.
- Only 10 drachma.
- Go to Hell!
Nothing.
- Do I look like a tourist?
- A hustler's dream.
I like the touch of the parasol.
- Genius!
- Come, sucker.
- Genuine antique?
- Oh, madam has a very keen eye.
No, it's an imitation, but of a period about 1000 BC. But I've got other things.
I'm Arthur Simpson, the uncrowned king of Kavala nightlife.
- I've got some Minoan cuff links...
- Thank you!
I've got some Hellenistic ones of the ninth dynasty...
- Hey!
- What? You want me, sir?
Come to the yacht club after lunch.
Might have a little job for you.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Voula. Voula my doll.
I smell hard currency.
Take the plate.
Off home now, girl, and iron the tie.
- Ah, Simpson!
- Oh, yes, yes.
I know, I know, I know.
You wicked thing, you.
Here comes the schmo.
I'm sorry I'm late. I ran into an old friend... archaeologist.
- We used to run an art publication.
- Simpson,
- how'd you like to earn a fast buck?
- Sir?
100 bucks, to be precise.
But if you are not interested...
- I am, sir.
- You live here?
Yes, well, while my own place up there is being done up,
I'm right down... right down there.
You see that Lincoln?
Don't see many of them in Kavala, sir.
It's been rented by a friend to take to Turkey. He's going by sea.
- Do you know Istanbul?
- Turkey, oh, yes. Istanbul, yes.
Good. Here's what you will do. Take the car to the Hilton Hotel, Istanbul.
- Your papers and licence in order?
- Oh yes, Mr... Yes, sir.
Here is the car key.
Leave it with the hotel porter.
Tell him the car is for Mr Plimpton.
Got it? Plimp-ton. P-l-i-m-p...
P-t-o-n. Tes.
They'll want the papers at the border.
They're in the glove department.
Glove department. Yes, sir.
Just one more little thing, Simpson.
This car is worth over $13,000.
If I don't hear from Mr
Plimpton by 5 o'clock tomorrow,
I'll report to the police here. Understood?
That was uncalled for, sir.
Mr Simpson can be relied on.
He has a very reliable face.
- Thank you, Mrs...
- Miss.
Oh!
- Bon voyage, Mr Simpson.
- Godspeed, Arthur Simpson.
Walter, suppose they really search the car at the border.
It could happen.
- Suppose they find...
- Finders keepers.
- What about Simpson?
- I'm afraid they will keep him, too.
- They'll ask him about us.
- So? Who is us?
We didn't rent the car,
Plimpton did, and he doesn't exist.
All our plans, all our hopes, riding in the car with that... what did you call him?
Schmo.
Schmo.
Istanbul, I love you.
Uh-oh.
- Morning.
- Passport.
Morning. Mind if I watch?
- Mr Arthur Simpson?
- Mr Simpson, yes.
There's nothing wrong there, I hope.
- You are English?
- Oh, yes.
Then why you have Egyptian passport?
That's a long story. My father was a British officer... a colonel.
- Then why not a British passport?
- I'm coming to that.
Mummy... my mother... she was Egyptian.
In fact, I was born over there, in Egypt.
Cairo. Which is in... Egypt.
Yes?
Well, there was some trouble with the marriage documents.
Troop movements. You gentlemen know what it's like in the army.
- I know how it is in the army.
- Yes. The army, yes.
Mr Simpson, this passport is not good.
It expired nearly three weeks ago.
This?
I'll tell you what, as soon as we get to Istanbul...
I'm sorry, Mr Simpson.
You must go back to Greece.
Uh...
I do not speak Arabic.
Uh, officer? Officer?
May I have your ear for a moment, please?
Now, you misunderstand entirely.
I thought that the Turks were a hospitable people.
I know somebody who is going to have something to say about this... me!
And another thing. I...
- Be careful!
- Don't!
- Mefkufsunuz.
- Mefkufsunuz?
- What does that mean?
- That means you're under arrest!
Mefkufsunuz.
- Uh...
- You will speak when spoken to!
- When did you join the Sigma group?
- Me?
- Who recruited you?
- Nobody.
- So you volunteered.
- No, no, please.
- I was hired to drive, to...
- Who else did the man and woman see?
I don't know.
- Did they send other arms out of Greece?
- No.
- Did they tell you?
- No.
- Then how do you know?
- I don't know...
- Why did you lie?
- I did not lie. I mean...
Simpson, be careful.
I am a victim of circumstances.
Ci...
I swear it.
Look here, I think it's time you took me to my embassy.
- You can... you can call...
- Call which embassy?
I doubt the Egyptian authorities will issue a passport to Arthur Simpson.
It seems there is a dossier.
The Egyptians bear me a grudge, sir, because I claim to be British.
In 1958, he was deported from Britain for smuggling pornographic literature.
An art magazine, sir.
Called...
Stop Press Nudes.
But may I remind you gentlemen that not so very long ago,
James Joyce and even Lady Chatterley herself were considered obscene.
Simpson, the penalty for terrorism is death.
Were you going to use the roof of the Hilton? One of the balconies?
Balconies? What for?
Where would you use the smoke grenade?
Are they for your accomplices, to create confusion?
Accomplices? I don't know.
Simpson, you're aware next Tuesday is our annual Army Day parade?
I swear on the life of my fa... of my mother.
You know our chiefs of staff and the foreign military missions will be together on the grandstand?
Their safety is our responsibility.
We shall be merciless with anyone who threatens it. Merciless.
You frighten me, sir, but after all, that's part of your job.
But if my father could hear you now, he'd laugh himself sick.
He wasn't no colonel, sir.
I just said that in order to make myself seem important, you know.
He was a sergeant. Acting sergeant.
Acting, unpaid sergeant.
Do you know what he used to say?
He used to say, "Arthur,
Arthur, you're a carbuncle on the behind of humanity."
Carbuncle. I'm a nothing!
I'm a nobody! Me, with a gun?
Me, up on the roof?
I don't like heights, sir.
I get very dizzy. Honestly.
I don't know what you're up to, sir, but I can see it from your face.
You don't think that I'm a terrorist?
All right.
I will give you a chance to prove it.
You will work for us.
I can't do that, sir.
- If they were to find out, they'd kill me.
- You will not let them find out.
Mefkufsunuz.
The arms are back in the car, just as they were.
The chances are they won't be touched until the evening before Army Day, but you will check them constantly.
If they have been touched, you will report at once.
- What's the matter?
- I feel dizzy. Uh...
This is for your messages.
Cigarettes.
Be always sure to have an empty pack.
Put your messages there, and drop them from the car.
That car will follow you everywhere.
They will pick them up wherever you go.
Most important, report everything you overhear.
Everything, no matter how trivial it may seem to you.
One word could tell us whom they work for.
- Yes, sir.
- Remember our briefing for the Hilton?
Hilton? Oh, yes.
If you betray us, we will know. Understand?
- Yes.
- OK.
Courage, Simpson. You are now an agent of Turkish Security.
- Off you go.
- Oh, well, you can rely on me, sir.
Stop!
I've come. I've got the documents for Mr Plimpton's car here.
- Any mail for Mr Barlow?
- No.
- Thank you.
- Mr Plimpton? Is he staying here?
I was supposed to deliver them here for Mr Barlow... Plimpton.
- I will give it to him when he comes.
- Thank you.
I've been waiting for my telegram for three weeks.
It must be here somewhere!
It isn't possible. When my aunt says she sends a telegram, she sends a telegram.
Was that the driver of Mr Plimpton's car?
- Yes. Do you want me to stop him?
- No, I'll catch him up.
I have been coming for three weeks.
Mr Plimpton, I'm the lad who drove your car from Kavala.
She's a beautiful machine.
She really will motor.
- Thank you.
- Uh, um...
I suppose you want some remuneration.
- Oh, the gasoline, sir.
- You mean the petrol.
Oh, I thought you might be an American.
No.
Well, that will be $46, sir, calculating the drachma at 29.7 and...
There. Have a pleasant journey back to Greece.
Oh, Greece, yes.
The home of Homer, of...
- Oh, thank you very much, Mr...
- Goodbye.
I'm sorry, I don't speak a word of Turkish.
- You'll have to ask somebody else.
- Please to show your car papers.
My car papers? Why didn't you say so?
- You are Mrs Plimpton?
- Of course I'm not Mrs Plimpton.
- Effendi.
- That's all right. I'm not offended.
- Is not you who bring car into country?
- No. There's a driver.
Oh. Turkish law says only gentleman who bring car or Mrs Plimpton may drive.
- I didn't know that. Now the driver's gone.
- You may not drive this car.
What do you expect me to do?
- You are not Mrs Plimpton.
- I know that. There is the driver. Driver!
- Driver!
- Called me, sir?
Come here a moment, will you?
Why don't you get rid of that drunken cook? Makes me crazy.
He goes with the villa.
Learn to live with him.
What's the matter? What's the matter?
In my country, cooks cook, no shervish table.
Shervish people shervish table.
Blurry foreigns.
Put the tray down and get out.
Get out or I'll break your neck!
OK.
Ah, pig.
Easy, Hans.
I've told you, one servant is already one servant too many.
For poor Hans, too.
Come on, maybe you'll beat me.
- There's always a first time.
- I played backgammon...
- Not backgammon, tavli.
- What's the difference?
The difference between you and the Turks.
It's their game. Backgammon.
He doesn't need speech.
He talks with his whole body.
- His body talks too much.
- Play.
Cedric is here with the car.
Somebody's with him.
Who is it, Giulio?
- He's brought Simpson. Why?
- Damn! What can we do with him here?
You wouldn't take the car in, would you? Sit down.
Ah, Cedric, you have picked up Plimpton's car, good man.
Forgive us, we began tea without you.
You've brought Simpson with you.
How nice to see you, Mr Simpson.
An unexpected pleasure.
- Nothing wrong, I hope?
- No, no, but...
I say, I'm afraid we've run foul of the Turkish law.
They threatened to take the car away.
Only Plimpton or Simpson's allowed to drive it, or take it out of the country.
How silly of Plimpton not to have known.
- No other misadventures, Simpson?
- Apart from the customs.
Poor Mr Simpson.
Did they search the car?
Took the seats out, underneath...
Did they find my heroin and marijuana?
No. Tou hid those too well.
We'll take advantage of your being here.
Take us sightseeing until Mr Plimpton arrives.
Hans, take Simpson to the kitchen and see that he gets fed and has a room.
Come on.
- Bon appétit, Mr Simpson.
- Don't overdo it.
He scared me to death.
- You are foreign not?
- Oh, no. I'm English.
Oh, you OK.
Yeah, you good man, like the King Victoria.
I say, those people out there, they're tourists?
Huh? Ha!
- Aren't they?
- Take.
Everybody, all misters...
Russische spies.
Russians? No. They're a different class of people. That lady's very...
Everybody Russische spies. Fischer...
Fischer is Germanische spy for Russische. I kill him.
Yes, I kill him. I'll get a medal, big like this.
Music, boom-broom. General...
I kill him, my friend. Hmm?
- Are you here officially?
- Huh?
Are you here officially?
You mean... Oh, I understood.
Fishely? No. No fishely.
Give you good meat.
I give Russische spies fishely.
Fresh fishely...
English friend, no fishely.
Good meat, shish kebab. Understood?
Good meat, shish kebab. Understood.
Well, I thought I understood.
Stop pacing.
This is not a cage, and you are not a lion.
OK, I am wrong. You are a lion... the king of the jungle. My king.
Well, don't just stand there. Roar.
- Or give me a kiss.
- Later.
That's what I like about you Swiss. You're so sexy.
I don't like Simpson being here.
Arthur Simpson is keeping you away from my side?
- He's harmless. He's a schmo.
- No, no, no, no.
It's not that. It's a departure from the plan. This I hate.
Not true. You do everything with style.
It's a departure from your style, this you hate. For this I love you.
Mm. Style, my eye.
As long as I get the emerald for you, you don't care how I get it.
Walter, I don't hide the way
I feel about the emerald.
I don't hide the way
I feel about you.
The emerald excites me physically, like a man.
Like you. You excite me.
The emerald and you are fused in my mind.
Each of you excites me more because of the other.
Mm.
I thought the evening was lost.
I was beginning to wonder whom I could turn to next.
How about Giulio? Isn't he fused in your mind with your emerald, too?
Mm.
But there is a dilemma... so is Hans, so is Cedric Page.
There's a fine figure of a man.
But watch out, the English are not what they seem.
- Read the papers.
- I know.
There's Arthur Simpson, too.
I feel a strange attraction.
- What's so strange?
- You're so understanding.
He has beautiful eyelashes.
Have you noticed?
First thing I noticed.
Do you mind that I am a nymphomaniac?
No. It's your most endearing quality.
Don't waste it, use it.
The door is open, darling.
Now, Mr Simpson, you can show us how well you know Istanbul.
We want to see Saint Sophia...
- And the Grand Bazaar.
- Everything.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Go ahead.
No, no. I prefer my own brand. I've got a...
Huh? Uh-oh. How stupid of me.
Whoop!
- Papa, there's your pretty searchlight.
- Shut up!
Ooh! Candyfloss!
Couldn't be better. Just a few hundred yards from the museum.
There's your enemy, the searchlight.
But Walter will take care of it, eh?
Follow me.
- Are the arms in the car?
- They haven't been touched.
I don't think you're an idiot. What made you suspect they're Russian spies?
- I deduced it.
- From what?
- The cook.
- What did he say?
- They're Russian spies.
- A clever deduction.
- Are they expecting Mr Plimpton?
- I believe they are.
- Is he their leader?
- I think it's Mr Harper.
- And Miss Lipp has her say.
- What has Miss Lipp to say?
- Did you hear her talk to anyone?
- Yes, I heard her speak to Mr Harper.
- What did she say?
- Personal things.
- I don't think they'd be of any interest.
- Everything she says is of interest.
- Well, she said I was attractive.
- Fool! She knew you were listening!
- That's impossible.
- Why'd she say anything so stupid?
Well, she did. She went further.
She said I had beautiful eyelashes.
Did Miss Lipp confide any more tender secrets to Mr Harper?
Yes, she did. She said she was a nymphomaniac!
There!
- I just came from the villa.
- What did you find?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
This is your last chance, Simpson.
Today is Thursday. On Saturday, three days before the army parade, your friends will be arrested and locked safely away.
If, before that, you don't learn who they work for, you'll be charged with smuggling arms into Turkey for terrorist purposes.
That's what I call a handsome man.
Him I would like to take home.
Ah, madam, the sultan lives here with me.
But please, you come and visit him again.
We can't. We leave on Monday.
- Monday.
- Monday.
Well, now that the sultan has seen you, maybe the sultan will leave with you.
Whereas the famous Istanbul dagger contains the four world's most priceless emeralds.
The Topkapi treasury is also famous for...
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
Excuse me. Hope I didn't hurt you.
- Any time.
- It's a date.
Did you get the impression of the key?
- Naturally. Did Cedric get his?
- Yes.
Look behind me. That's the longest stretch of roof we have to cross.
Look for the places where we can lie low.
The searchlight sweeps that roof every 21 seconds.
I can't shoot that light until we get to this roof.
It's only from there that I can get a clear shot at it.
Well, we paid our respects to culture.
Tomorrow we'll see the wrestling.
That I like more.
Hey!
While the guards are busy coughing, this will assure our means of transport.
Pull.
- There is no stronger knot.
- Too strong.
I don't want to leave it up there.
You agreed, "not a trace".
Momento. Giulio...
Pull.
- Genius!
- Boy scout.
- Walter!
- Giulio.
You fool! Sports cars?
Understand this well: for a year, you'll buy nothing.
For a year, you will rot in your garret.
There will be an army organised to find us... investigators, detectives, and informers.
The overnight millionaire will be caught in a spotlight from Istanbul to Peru.
This project's been planned to the last detail and will work.
If our timing is right, the whole
Turkish Army can't stop us.
We've made contact with Josef at the fair.
Josef is waiting for our signal to move.
You were chosen because you're unknown to the police, and it'll stay that way.
Everything's ready.
Everything has been timed...
All of the time I knew that you spy on the spies.
OK, Giulio?
If there's to be a killing, there can only be one leader.
And that doesn't go for Turkey alone.
Good evening. It's a bit warmer...
- Yeah!
- ...tonight.
- Who's there?
- What are you doing here?
- I'm afraid it's cook, sir.
- Put him to bed.
- Get to bed, you drunken pig!
- Fischer, you Scheisskopf! I kill you!
- Scheisskopf?
- I make you chop-chop!
Big bakaklish.
I make pipilish on you!
Don't be such an idiot!
I give you chotchka!
Hans!
Bakaklish!
My hands!
My hand! My hand!
My hand! He's ruined my hand!
Ah!
So close, so close, and then this idiot...
I'm sorry, darling.
I know how you feel.
Ah-ah! No good looking at me, dear.
I couldn't possibly hold Giulio.
Why, I used to get blisters just holding my cricket bat.
Walter.
Cedric, call Simpson.
- Simpson?
- Simpson.
Simpson.
Giulio, bring the nylon cord from the fishing basket.
- Simpson.
- Yes, yes, sir.
Simpson, you are wanted.
Give it to him, Giulio.
Simpson, I've just bet $100 you can pull this sofa six feet with just the strength of your arms.
If you win, you get half.
- I'm not very good at this, sir.
- Try.
As you wish, but you are not asking me to do this just to settle some bet.
Bravo, Mr Simpson, but you would still get your $50.
Do it, Mr Simpson.
Do it! Prove that you are a man, not a jelly.
Feet together. Just the strength of your arms.
You can do it, Arthur.
I didn't mean to talk to you like that.
I'm very fond of you.
Try it again, please.
Don't yank the cord. Just pull steadily, hand over hand.
You can do it.
Quiet! Feet together.
Good, Arthur.
Good.
Steady, steady!
Hand over hand.
Bravo!
Oh! Oh... Oh, well.
- Dare we?
- Yes.
We can't postpone.
- Arthur.
- Yes.
Come sit down.
Get it, Giulio.
Simpson, how would you like to make $10,000?
Ten?
Hoo! Whoo.
Paris, Roma, Washington.
Not a dossier on any single one of them.
No dossier, no dossier, no dossier.
But Simpson, "I heard Walter say, if we are to make a killing, there can be only one leader."
"And if our timing is right, the whole Turkish Army can't stop us."'
Do you know what this is?
It's the... sultan's dagger from the museum.
Not yet. We are going to put it in the museum.
Close you mouth, my dear fellow.
Thank you.
Miss Lipp made the copy.
Isn't she clever?
We are going to exchange it for the original.
And we are confident it will be a long time before anyone is the wiser.
That's how you will earn $10,000.
You will be on the museum roof and lower Giulio over the side by rope.
Museum roof?
That's impossible.
It has to be possible.
Now that you know about it, you have no choice.
You don't understand.
I don't like heights. I get dizzy.
Give me your hand.
Arthur, you are a clever man.
You could have gone far.
But you always played for small stakes.
This is your chance.
You can do it.
It won't be so difficult.
You won't be on the edge of the roof.
- Yes, but can I do it?
- You can.
All right. I'll do it.
- But what about Turkish Security?
- What about Turkish Security?
They don't know about the museum.
They think you're terrorists.
Who thinks so?
Who? Who?
It's your own fault. Why'd you get me to do your dirty work?
Why'd you get me to bring the arms into the country?
They found the arms at the border, and they let you in the country?
Then you must be working for them.
The time has come for us to leave this beautiful country.
Cedric, who is going to let you out?
Who, indeed?
They left the arms in the car, didn't they?
Yes.
And when do they think we'll move?
Not till Tuesday.
But they're gonna pick you up on Saturday.
Saturday.
That gives us a little time, doesn't it?
Time for what? We can't go forwards, we can't go back. We're trapped.
- We're finished.
- Who says we are finished?
- Just a minute.
- Quiet, Hans.
When Walter fights in a corner, that's when he fights at his best.
One thing is sure... the gun, the grenades... they stay in the car.
We cannot touch them, ever.
How can you shoot at the searchlight without a rifle?
How can you get away from the guards without the grenades?
The searchlight and the guards.
The searchlight and the guards.
The searchlight and the guards.
There must be a solution.
Searchlight.
I wonder.
Cedric.
Cedric.
The guards.
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth, laugh.
- What's so funny?
- Laugh!
I have news for you.
Maybe it's even better. God bless the Turkish Security. Cedric.
- You want to see me laugh?
- No.
I want you to take Elizabeth fishing.
- What are you doing?
- I'm being a lighthouse.
- Did you get in?
- We did.
Good. Tell me.
It was too easy.
The poor man was so lonely.
And we did get that invitation to go back tonight.
- Good!
- To do what? Hmm? Guess.
Something no Turk can resist.
- Must I guess?
- Wrong. Tavli.
I have been invited to play tavli!
Giulio, come here.
Put your hand on the table.
Now, spread your fingers.
Turn my hand. This is the way the beam revolves.
Two great wheels, their cogs interlocked, turning each other so.
Now, try again.
You see, when I do this, it's slower.
- How much can you reduce the speed?
- Almost by half.
The beam comes around every 21 seconds. You can slow it down to 40.
You gain about 18 or 19 seconds,
Giulio. Is that enough?
Good work, Cedric.
I never liked that gun.
It upset the artist in me.
Picasso!
- Did you talk to Josef?
- He's ready, willing, and very amused.
Now, there is just one more little change.
We go tonight.
I'm getting dizzy.
Now, lift it up.
- What is it?
- Don't worry.
Not even Hans could do it. It's like lifting 200 pounds with one hand.
Oh.
Oh!
That dropped on the museum floor and we are cooked.
- Cooked?
- Nothing to worry about.
You just concentrate on the $10,000.
- Again?
- I'm nervous.
To the attention of Major Ali Tufan.
I, Arthur Simpson, herewith regretfully resign from the Turkish Security services.
Now, be sure not to lose them.
Do you want them to follow us to the museum?
Are they coming up on the roof with us?
We are not going to the museum yet.
First we're going to the wrestling stadium.
- Wrestling, at this time of day?
- It's a big annual event.
There's a carnival, too.
It goes on all day until 8.30pm.
By which time, Arthur, you'll be tired, happy, and rich!
Rich!
Psst!
It will all be this easy, Arthur.
Psst.
Search every corner of the villa.
Look everywhere for a cigarette package.
How much longer are we staying here?
Until... now.
Ah! Aaah!
You are all right, Arthur.
You are doing fine.
Now the alarm system is set in every room of the museum.
There isn't a floor that can be touched.
- What do we do next?
- Nothing. Sit.
- Sit?
- Sit. Until dark.
Sit. What then?
Then we'll make our way to the Treasury.
- Where's that?
- Over there.
Huh?
In... in the dark?
It's impossible.
We have to make it in the dark.
There are guards.
Not with me. I'll fall, you see.
I get too dizzy.
Fool, it's easier in the dark.
I don't think you understand. You won't get me across there in the dark.
- You will!
- You can kill me...
Shh!
You can kill me, I don't care.
I'm not going across in the dark.
No!
All right.
We'll go now.
This way. Move!
Come on!
Are you all right, Arthur?
Never... never better.
All right, Arthur. From now on, it's all easy. Come!
There is the Treasury. The roof is not very strong here, so one at a time.
First me, then you, then Giulio.
- It's down here.
- Will you be going through that window?
No. That would be too easy. We can't reach the dagger through here.
Hm?
- That fair anything to do with us?
- A little bit, Arthur.
All right?
They leave in an hour.
It's going like clockwork.
That means the fair is ready to leave, and Elizabeth and Cedric are on their way to the lighthouse.
It will be dark soon.
All right, gentlemen, it's time to undress.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Are you ready?
- Ready.
Good!
- What's that?
- The guard house.
Oh, those smoke grenades... they were intended to deal with that?
They were.
They'll see Giulio going down.
Elizabeth and Cedric are taking care that they don't.
It'll be seconds until
Cedric gets to the light.
Put your weight against the wall.
Stop.
Brace yourself.
Go!
Argh!
Don't let my hand go! Shh, shh, shh.
Hold it. I've got it.
Pull!
Up!
Hold it!
- Hey!
- Oh!
You're not gonna leave me here, are you? I don't fancy that hole.
No, Arthur, I wouldn't go anywhere without you. Come on.
If I get this out, it'll give you some support.
- Can we go soon?
- In about ten minutes.
But let's take Giulio with us... and the dagger.
You are not going to lose your nerve?
It's not a question of losing my nerve. I never had none.
Giulio's on the sill now.
I'll help you lower him down.
Can't he do anything by himself?
Let's go to work.
Stop!
Pull up.
You have to hold it by yourself now, OK?
Yes.
I'm going to let go now,
Arthur. Ready?
Ready.
Pull up!
He's got it, Arthur. He's got it!
This is the last bit,
Arthur. Lower slowly.
Slowly!
I'll tell you when to stop.
Stop.
It's done.
The time has come to ask you to sit here on the edge.
Where else?
Put your hands around this bit of hose, think of $10,000, and hold on.
- Then you push me off the edge?
- I wouldn't do that.
- Major Tufan?
- Yes?
My name, sir, is Walter Harper.
This is Miss Lipp, Mr Page,
Mr Vecchi, Mr Fischer... and this is Mr Simpson, who's been driving us in a car rented by Mr Plimpton in Greece.
And borrowed by us while waiting for him.
Yes, dear.
What can I do for you, gentlemen? Madam?
Something quite extraordinary has happened,
I felt I should report to someone in authority.
- What do you wish to report to me?
- I heard a rattle in the car.
- I heard it first.
- Yes, dear. You heard it first.
I heard a rattle in the car, had it investigated, and discovered arms hidden in it.
- Arms?
- Yes.
A rifle and six grenades.
Were these arms in the car?
They certainly look like them.
How clever of you. Had you lost them?
No, madam. We had found them.
May I ask where you have been today?
At the wrestling, major.
It was quite an experience.
- Were you there all day, Mr Walter?
- Yes.
- Madam?
- All day.
Were you there all day, Mr Simpson?
No.
No, sir.
We didn't get there until after 3 o'clock.
Gentlemen, madam... sometimes a man's profession gives him a narrow view of things.
- I know now why you are here.
- Do you really, sir?
Yes, Mr Simpson.
A little bird told me.
Mefkufsunuz.
Tomorrow we're out.
- I have an idea.
- Oh, no!
There is a secret stairway in the Kremlin. The Romanov jewels...
Gentlemen...
Gentlemen, I bid you welcome, and beg at the very outset to be allowed to express my extreme gratitude...
That you have seen fit to grace this noble room with your presence this afternoon.
I... I have here to hand a document of high concern and vast importance...
Vast importance to each and every one of you.
This document, gentlemen, sets forth the rules regulating an agreement to enter upon a venture known as a tontine.
"... tontine. "
A tontine is, in point of fact, a lottery, a lottery, plain and simple, gentlemen.
"... simple. "
Into this tontine each parent - or guardian - has placed for each of you and in your name the sum of £1,000 sterling.
The sum so constituted is to be administered by a self-perpetuating board and held in trust by them for whomsoever survives.
"... survives. "
This £20,000 will grow and grow, under astute management, who will charge but a nominal fee, and this by then great sum will be handed to the one amongst you who is the last surviving member of the tontine.
It is as plain and as simple as that.
Therefore, allow me to say, in conclusion, long life to all.
But since no other shall be present when the winner has won...
"... has won... "
...let us cheer him now.
He whom fate sees fit to favour.
Oh. Hip-hip.
Hooray!
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!
- Hip-hip.
- Hooray!
- Cannon reloaded?
- Cannon reloaded, sir.
- Then fire.
- But sir...
You heard me, man. Fire!
Never fear, ladies. He knows his prey.
Ah, see, yonder.
Kill!
In the name of the Queen...
And so it gives me great pleasure to name this ship Repulsion.
God bless all who sail in her.
You swine!
They're disorganised!
Victory must soon be ours. Sound the charge!
- Sound the what, sir?
- Give that to me, you fool.
Now, then, my good men, what's all this poppycock about the mine not being safe, eh?
Speak up. What's wrong with it?
Not yet, Tumba.
You must learn the white man's code.
It is not sporting, it is not done, to fire at rhino until he's actually charging.
When I die, my son...
...all this will be yours.
Yes, Father.
In recognition of your many and varied services to the Crown...
...I dub thee...
Oh.
We are frightfully sorry, Sir Robert.
- Michael...
- Yes...
Yes, Grandfather?
The time has come...
Yes.
Yes, I really believe the time has come.
At last. At last.
Not so fast, sir! You're a very quick man with the sheet, Michael.
Oh, yes, yes. You see, sir, I thought...
I know what you thought, sir.
But let me tell you something.
Death cannot be assumed simply because signs of life are not present.
Hasn't medical school taught you how to take a pulse?
Oh, we have touched on it, sir.
But mostly, we cut up things.
Hmm.
- Do you know what this is?
- No, sir. I gave it to you unopened.
- Hackett is dead.
- Hackett, sir?
Mm-hm. Ebenezer Hackett.
I went to school with him.
An unpleasant name for a dirty little boy and an even dirtier old man.
Died of the pox, no doubt.
Now, the point is, sir, it only leaves my brother Joseph and me in the tontine.
- Oh, yes, I see, sir.
- Do you, sir? Do you?
I doubt it. I doubt it.
But we're not concerned with you, are we, eh?
We're concerned with me - my thoughts and feelings.
- That's right, sir.
- Yes.
Now, you're to go and get Joseph and tell him I want to see him.
Yes, sir.
- Won't that upset you, sir?
- Upset me? But of course it'll upset me.
But nothing will upset me more than not winning the tontine and leaving you with a mountain of debts and a doubtful future as an idiot in a profession of rogues and charlatans.
So, get him and tell him I'm dying.
Thank you, Peacock.
Privilege, sir.
How's your grandfather this morning?
- He says he's dying, Peacock.
- Oh, they always say that, sir.
But Peacock, he wants to see his brother Joseph.
- Master Joseph?
- Yes.
But they haven't even spoken to each other for 40 years.
Yes, I know, Peacock.
He must be dying!
Yes. Goodbye, Peacock.
Good day...
Michael.
There's too much excitement in this house.
Yes? Who is that?
Oh, er... yes.
Er... is Joseph Finsbury at home?
I can't hear you. Could you speak a little lower?
Is Joseph Finsbury at home?
Lower.
Is Joseph...
Oh, er...
Joseph Finsbury. Is he at home?
- No, he is not.
- Oh.
Could you tell me, then, when he is expected?
Who, may I ask, is enquiring?
Oh, allow me...
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Michael Finsbury, of the same name.
Oh...
Oh, I'm sorry to seem so inhospitable, but in the past 12 months alone, over 320 girls in the Greater London area have been attacked by persons unknown, and many of them unnecessarily mutilated.
- Do come in.
- Oh, yes.
Thank you.
They do say it's something to do with the weather.
Oh... yes.
So, you're Michael Finsbury?
Yes.
Actually, Michael Hubert Gregory Finsbury.
And I am your cousin Julia.
Yes, I know.
- Do come in.
- Thank you.
Oh, yes...
Er... do you er...
- Do you breed birds?
- Oh, no.
Cousin Morris is an ardent collector of eggs.
He has spent most of his adult life in the pursuit of them.
- Most commendable.
- Oh, do you think so?
I find them... obscene.
Well, yes, yes, of course. They are obscene.
I suddenly see now how obscene they are.
He doesn't pursue birds, I take it?
No. Only eggs.
Well, I'm glad, because that would be even more obscene.
Oh, I can see you are a deep thinker, like me.
What is your particular interest?
My consuming interest is the human body.
Oh...
Oh, I am studying to be a surgeon at St Mary's.
Oh, I see. So, that's where you go every morning. I see you often... er... through the window.
Oh, what an extraordinary coincidence!
I look at you through the window.
And I've often had a burning desire... to nod.
But my grandfather does not approve of such things.
Nor does my Uncle Joseph.
Yes.
Well...
There it is, then.
Is he at home, your Uncle Joseph?
Oh, no. He is in Bournemouth, taking the sun, with Cousin Morris and Cousin John.
Oh.
Might I enquire why you are enquiring?
- Well, my grandfather is dying.
- Oh...
Oh, it's nothing serious.
He's been dying for years.
But now he seems to have taken a turn for the worse, and he wants desperately to see his brother, before it is too late.
Well, you... you could send Uncle Joseph a telegraph.
They say the telegraphic service has much to commend it.
Yes. I've heard them say that.
What an excellent idea!
I've never sent one.
One should always broaden one's horizons.
Oh, yes...
Yes.
Well...
That's what I'll do, then.
Oh, thank you for pointing out to me how obscene eggs are.
It was a most... Excuse me.
It was a most illuminating observation.
Oh...
It was superb of you to call.
Oh, not at all.
I hope I shall see a great deal more of you.
Well... off to St Mary's.
Oh, yes, I'm... I'm...
I'm sure they have need of you there.
Along with everything else, Uncle Joseph says there are 124 tropical diseases that can be contracted here in England.
Mainly from fresh fruit, returning travellers and...
...hand towels in public places.
- Yes.
Really?
I must make a note of that. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Oh! Oh!
Listen to me, all you eggs. I met him!
I've finally met him!
Oh...
- Yes?
- It's Michael Finsbury again.
Oh... we mustn't make a habit of this.
People will begin to talk.
Oh, I fully agree.
It's just that...
I don't know where to send the telegraph.
Oh. Mrs Goodge's Boarding House...
Mrs Goodge's Boarding House...
...Flodden Road...
... Flodden Road...
...Bournemouth...
... Bournemouth...
- ... Hants.
... Hants.
Funny.
John! What are you doing? You're supposed to be looking after Uncle Joseph.
Ah! Uncle Joseph. I knew there was somebody
I was supposed to be looking after.
Erm... I merely threw my body across this young lady, to protect her from the falling... thing.
You realise you made me drop my grebe?
Oh, I'm awfully sorry, Morris.
Come outside.
Oh, Mr John, do you think he'll get me my notice?
Oh, don't worry. I'll take care of Mrs Goodge.
Tonight, then, at eight, behind the bandstand.
Oh, you insatiable creature!
John, I'm waiting!
You must control this obsession you have for chambermaids and other girls of that class.
I try. Night and day, I try.
Oh, there you are, boys.
I was just about to take this telegraph to your uncle.
Telegraph? From whom?
I don't know, Mr Morris.
Private matters are private with me.
I'll take it.
We must relive our madness tonight.
Ten o'clock, under the pier.
I'm coming, Cousin.
- What is it, Cousin?
- Look at that.
We're going to win!
We're going to win!
We're going to win! We're going to win!
We're going to win! We're going to win!
Later. Later. No time for celebration now.
Uncle!
Have you been smoking again, Uncle?
And you're in a draught. The window's open.
Well, shut it, and get his coat and things.
Uncle, dear, you're going out.
Going out? Well, that'll be jolly.
Yes, you're going to London.
London? Yes.
Now, where did I put it? Where is it?
Ah, here it is. Now, London.
Now, if you ascribe a number to each letter of the alphabet, beginning with A as one and B as two, culminating with the letter Z as 26, then the letters that compose the word London add up to 74, which, coincidentally, is my age.
- Lovely, Uncle. Now, read this.
- Yes. Get into your coat.
Why... Why this unseemly haste?
- Your brother is dying.
- What did you say?
What? Masterman? Masterman dying?
This must be the effect of the nutmeg tarts.
Nutmeg tarts!
At Harrow he lived on little else.
- Where are your gloves?
- I don't know.
I have for some time been compiling exhaustive notes on the peculiarities of spices and herbs in common use, and I have discovered that it can be authoritatively proved that the excessive indulgence in nutmeg leads to hallucination and general debilitation.
Pepper, on the other hand, in any form or variety, passes through the body without any effect on the organs.
It has absolutely no value, nutritive or otherwise.
But, in the case of cinnamon or cloves...
- Uncle...
- Yes? You have a question?
Read your paper.
- Tontine!
- Lovely word!
- Tontine!
- A derivation from the name Lorenzo Tonti, a banker of Neapolitan persuasion.
Read your paper, Uncle.
Morris, have you any idea how much it's worth?
Well over £100,000.
And we've earned every penny of it.
True, Cousin. True.
We've devoted our lives to him.
We were two little orphans.
We waited on him hand and foot.
It wasn't easy, keeping him alive.
Yes, it was difficult.
We kept him from the draughts.
We warmed his shoes before we put them on.
- We tucked him up in bed at night.
- Fed him every sort of tonic.
- Never thinking of ourselves.
- First in our hearts, first in our minds.
And now, after all these years... he's gone.
He's gone?
You go that way.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Excuse you, sir?
Mannerless young pup! Ought to be in the Army.
I beg your pardon, sir.
I take it these seats are not reserved.
I see you are proficient in the ancient and noble art of knitting.
I'm sure you know that examples of knitting, much like your afghan there, date back to the mainstream of the Egyptian civilisation.
Ah, the avocational activities of man are many and varied.
Some demand skill - yours, for instance.
Carpentry, or the playing of games with balls of various sizes.
- Have you found him?
- No.
Come on, then. This way.
Some demand inspiration - oil painting or the writing of epitaphs.
The rest of us, an uninspired lot, collect things.
My nephew, for instance...
...with whom I'm travelling... collects birds' eggs.
And I, for the last 63 years, have been collecting facts.
- He seems safe enough.
- Yes.
What a joy it is to indulge in convivial conversation with a fellow being, a kindred spirit.
This will prove the most amiable journey - you pursuing your hobby and me mine.
"Bournemouth strangler escapes.
Large-scale murder hunt in three counties. "
Ah, murder and murderers.
I once gave an informal lecture on the subject.
I wonder if you're aware, sir, of the fact that there is an increasing number of unsolved murders every year.
Now, this fact I gleaned from a pamphlet by the noted criminologist Sir Henry Stanhope - whose own murder, I might add, was never solved.
My word, sir,
I perceive we are travelling at a goodish rate.
You realise, sir, I state only facts, no opinions, and this fascinates everyone I meet.
Oh, don't be alarmed.
I shall continue, but for the moment,
I must take my leave.
Next stop: Basingstoke!
Basingstoke, next stop!
Er... Morris,
I may or may not be back in a moment.
Uncle, where are you going? Uncle!
- How dare you?
- My apologies. I'm looking for my uncle.
- Well, do I look like anybody's uncle?
- No, no. I'm terribly sorry.
- What do you make that out to be?
- What's that?
- 'Tain't, is it?
- It is, you know.
It's the 4.40 out of London!
It's the 4.50 out of Bournemouth!
Help me! Help me, somebody!
I think there's been an accident.
Fred...
- Yeah?
- We haven't heard the last of this.
Drag them out of the cab!
What's going on here, sir? Control yourself.
Look here! Stop all this damn rioting.
Now, look here, you men.
Dowse that fire in the baggage van.
Now, the children will arrange themselves by height, and the women in alphabetical order.
Now, I want a couple of volunteers.
You and you. Now, follow me.
Get those bags down. Form a human chain.
Sir... I didn't lose my right eye in the Indian Mutiny to have my left eye offended by the youth of England standing with their arses hanging out.
Dress yourself, sir. Dress yourself.
One of the most disgusting sights
I've ever seen. Dress yourself, sir.
You are, I suppose, aware of the fact that accidents occur with more frequency on standard-gauge railways?
Abigail? Abigail? Abigail?
Has anyone seen Abigail?
John! Come out of there at once.
Where's Uncle Joseph? Where is he?
Er... I... was just having a look for him in there.
- Come along.
- Morris...
Do you realise it's a criminal offence to wear that coat?
I'm not wearing any trousers.
But... but that too is a criminal affair.
Uncle Joseph?
- I hope you don't mind if I take my leave.
- Oh, would you, sir?
Uncle Joseph?
Uncle Joseph?
Uncle Joseph?
Cousin!
Oh... oh, no.
Oh, don't tell me. I can't bear it. Is it him?
- Of course it's him!
- Well, how do you know?
Well, look at his coat. It's his coat.
Is he dead?
What's left of him is very dead indeed.
Are you going to say a prayer or something?
Not at a time like this.
Now, you listen to me, Uncle Joseph.
You may be dead, but you listen to me.
You're a nasty, mean, spiteful, vindictive old man, to do this to two little orphans.
Your brother's on his deathbed.
Couldn't you have waited a day?
You stupid oaf!
- Look, I'll get some help.
- What's the use?
Wait. Let me think.
- Into the woods.
- Oh. Right. Yes.
- With him!
- Who?
- Uncle Joseph.
- Into the woods with Uncle Joseph?
Don't stand there.
The tontine - we may still win it.
- But he's dead.
- He's not dead until I say he's dead.
Hey!
Hey, sir!
Ah. I wonder, sir, if you and your fine bay gelding are heading for London.
- I am, sir.
- And what would you ask a passenger?
- Your company would be payment enough, sir.
- Oh...
Well, thank you.
Hey.
Well, I wonder if you realise how many times the word "whip" occurs in the Old Testament.
174 times.
Oh, I see you are impressed.
But that figure is infinitesimal, when you consider that the Bible contains
774,176 words altogether.
And it is a remarkable fact...
Do get on, or we'll be here all night.
Well, a penknife's not the ideal tool, is it?
Anyway, I don't think we ought to do this.
I don't want to go to prison.
Don't start snivelling in that revolting way.
If you can't dig a hole for him, cover him in leaves or something. Cover him.
But why do I always have to do the dirty work?
Because you are remarkably stupid.
Yes, I forgot that. Sorry.
In any case, I have to look after my hands.
Petal-soft hands are the mark of a great ornithologist. Now, get on with it!
Morris, I beg of you - let's have done with this.
Let's get an undertaker. He won't be too expensive and he'll do a professional job.
- We're not burying him.
- We're not?
We're merely hiding him.
- Merely hiding him.
- What we need is a venal doctor.
But uncle Joseph's dead! It's too late.
Not for him, for us. Now, you remember that chamber maid you got into erm?
- Thing.
- Thing. Who was the doctor who did the er?
Thing. Er Pratt. Dr Pratt.
Was he venal?
I didn't like to ask.
- Well, did he do the?
- Thing. Yes.
- Good.
- But what's he got to do with it?
He's part of the plan.
Now, you and I are the only two people in the world who know that Uncle Joseph is erm...
- Thing.
- Dead. And we won't tell anyone.
But people are bound to find out sooner or later.
Not quite yet.
Now, Uncle Masterman, at best, has only two or three days to live.
When he goes, I'll announce that Uncle Joseph has died of a heart attack on hearing the tragic news of his brother's death.
I then go along to your accommodating Dr er...
- Pratt.
- Thing.
He provides me with a blank death certificate for Uncle Joseph.
I fill in the date and the tontine is mine.
- Ours.
- We'll go into that later.
There come moments in life, cousin, when every man must find moral courage.
Your moment is about to come.
- It is?
- It is.
I'll go to London, tell everybody that you and Uncle Joseph have been delayed.
You go back to Bournemouth and remain there till I send for you.
I see, but erm... what about him?
I'm coming to that.
You must find a suitable box or container, crate him up and send him back to London.
We shall, after all, need him at the funeral.
Crate him in a box? What sort of box?
Something of suitable size and robustness for a man in that condition.
If you'll allow me, sir.
I will take charge of the rest of the packing.
All right, Peacock.
But don't lean too far in the barrel.
I say! We've received a telegraph.
It must be from Uncle.
Oh, drat.
No. It's from Lady Pitman.
She's sending back that statue we sent her, says it's a fraud.
"I am having it crated and sent back to you at once. "
Was it a fraud, Peacock?
Life is a fraud, Master Michael.
Yes, Peacock.
Well, this is all right, isn't it?
This should fetch a good price at Sotheby's.
Well, if it arrives in one piece, sir.
Well, there's nothing else to sell.
Except the piano.
It's all right, Peacock, I'll answer it.
Michael Finsbury, do I presume?
- Yes?
- I'm your cousin, Morris Finsbury.
- Oh, do come in.
- Thank you.
- Isn't Uncle Joseph with you?
- Alas, no.
My dear uncle, like your beloved grandfather, is of advancing years and declining health.
Grandfather will be disappointed.
May I take your coat?
No, thank you. No, thank you.
Uncle Joseph is naturally deeply concerned with his brother's death - I mean, illness.
- Or is he already?
- Oh, no, no, not yet.
What a relief to us all.
I know you are a medical student, cousin, so I need hardly remind you that blood is thicker than water.
Yes, five times, as I believe.
Uncle Joseph is valiantly gathering what remains of his strength in order to come to London in the next day or two to be with his dear brother... at the end.
I do hope he will be in time.
Uncle Masterman is that low?
Yes.
Oh, I am filled with an immense grief... that that proud and lovely man should...
Oh, my God.
Sir...
Sir, it's me - Maurice.
Oh, look at that noble face ravaged by time, those eyes filled with pain.
Oh, I should never have forgiven myself, if I hadn't seen you before.
- Cousin...
- But you shouldn't be out of bed.
- Cousin, this is our butler.
- No need to call him.
I can assist my own flesh and blood.
Who's the butler?
I have that honour, sir.
How dare you embrace me!
Grandfather is upstairs, sleeping.
All right, Peacock, you may go.
Thank you, Master Michael, sir.
Thank you, too, Colonel.
I, too, must be on my way, cousin.
I have some urgent, pressing business.
You will let us know the moment Uncle Joseph arrives.
As soon as I've got the date.
That is, immediately.
A great pity, cousin, that grief is the agent responsible for bringing us together after all these years.
Cousin Morris had no trousers on, Peacock.
If you say so, sir.
For heaven's sake, Julia.
Oh, it's you, Morris. I thought it was the Bournemouth strangler.
It says in the papers he might be in London.
Do I look like the Bournemouth Strangler?
Well... yes, you could be, Morris.
Why are you wearing that strange coat?
Because it suits me to wear it.
I think you should have it shortened.
Isn't Uncle Joseph with you?
Er... no, erm... the news in The Telegraph came as a great shock to him.
He is remaining in Bournemouth with Cousin John.
And now I must bid you good night.
Good night, cousin.
You won't always wear that coat, will you?
It's very frightening.
It could easily have been the Bournemouth Strangler instead of you.
I might have been stalked by him and, in fleeing, been trampled by a runaway horse.
Perhaps a large hole in my head, my brains spilling out all over Shaftesbury Avenue.
Oh, wouldn't that have been a homecoming for you, going to the mortuary to identify my poor, crushed body?
Body? What body?
No body, Morris. I was just thinking aloud.
You mustn't use that word. It isn't becoming.
Oh, I meant a dead body, Morris.
Not what is under a person's clothing.
Julia.
Now, why... did I say that?
See that it gets on the first available train.
If I could help you with your baggage.
It's rather heavy.
There have, of course, been many editions of the Bible, some famous, some infamous.
For instance, there is the Wicked Bible, so called because the word "not" is omitted from the seventh commandment, making it read: "Thou shalt commit adultery. "
A small error which could encourage certain sections of the populace to a frenzy of immorality unknown since first-century Rome.
Speaking of which, have you heard that the Emperor Heliogabalus?
I'm afraid, sir, that this is as far as I go.
What? Oh, splendid. Excellent, excellent.
Many, many thanks.
13 hours seemed but so many minutes.
Well, perhaps you might care to know who your fellow traveller was.
Non other than Joseph Finsbury, scholar extraordinary, lecturer, and one of the two Englishmen living who can speak pure Swahili.
Well, said, sir.
Well, well, who knows, perhaps our paths may cross again?
- God save us.
- Ah!
Oh! Good.
Good, yes. Thank you, Peacock.
It is Peacock, isn't it?
It is, sir.
Ah! How long has it been?
I came as quick as I could.
It's Master Joseph, Peacock.
Master Joseph!
Oh! Forgive me, sir.
It must be all of 40 years.
- Yes.
- Yes, yes.
I remember clearly the last time I saw you.
On that very day, the American, Colonel Colt, inventor of the Colt revolver, used electricity to detonate a torpedo, thereby destroying a brig in full sail upon the Potomac in Washington DC.
The present, not the former capital of the
United States, New York City, being the first...
I take it my brother is upstairs?
Yes, sir.
- May I announce you, sir?
- No, no. I will announce myself.
You might perhaps bring me a cup of tea.
I am a trifle piqued.
With pleasure, sir.
China, of course. You'll remember,
I developed a taste for it in Turkey during the 23rd revolution there.
Oh, ha ha, yes.
Masterman?
Masterman?
Is that you, Mother?
It is I - Joseph.
Joseph?
Brother Joseph.
What unexpected joy.
Don't tax yourself, brother.
I am raised in spirits already.
Doesn't raise mine to find you so, lying in the very bed in which our dear papa passed from us.
I am soon to follow his example, I fear.
Never say it.
But I do say it.
Last week old Hackett.
Next week, or even before...
...old Masterman.
Ah, yes. Poor Hackett.
I must somehow attend his funeral.
Our generation, brother, is on its way to Valhalla.
Or, as the Red Indians so aptly put it, the happy hunting ground.
Let me... give you a glass of good cheer. Hm?
It will seal the occasion... and revive your spirits.
Oh, no, thanks. I've asked for some tea.
Oh.
Ah... Ah...
Oh, what... What is it, brother?
Shall I send for a physician?
Oh, no, no. No, send for no-one.
I only want you.
- Jo-jo.
- Oh... oh, Jo-jo.
Jo-jo. Oh, those boyhood names.
Oh! What fond memories they recall.
Argh!
My goodness! My gracious!
What... What is it?
Are you hurt?
No, no, no. I needed some air.
I must... I must have air.
Open the window, Joseph.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Oh. Bless my soul.
You're down again.
Here. Let me...
Come on. Oh.
Yes, now, you lie here... and let me open the window.
What was that? What was that?
Surely... Surely the populace are not demonstrating?
Yesterday, do you know,
I had the narrowest of escapes.
- Upon my soul, I could have been killed.
- Killed?
I was in the water closet of the Bournemouth Express, when it quite unaccountably exploded, thereby extensively damaging the rest of the train.
I can't really think that I was to blame, although at the time I was smoking.
But it didn't... damage you?
No, no, no.
Thanks for the thought.
I confess, I am a trifle ruffled.
Yes... I think I'll lie low at the club a few days.
My nephews have been most annoying of late.
Oh, brother, no, no. Don't test yourself.
Sit down. It's you who should sit up here.
You may have a nutmeg poisoning.
Take a sip of your glass of good cheer, dear old chap.
It may prove effective.
Do you know, it's the most astonishing thing, there is a tribe of aborigines in Southwest Tasmania who distil the chewed bark of the banyan tree.
Enough, you pedantic, boring old poop!
A pedantic, boring, old...
- Poop!
- I shall leave you... brother.
You've lost your reason.
Reason? Reason, yes.
But not... not the tontine!
Here it is!
Too late to apologise.
- Name of Finsbury, sir?
- Yes?
Sign here, please, sir.
Where do you want it, sir?
Anywhere, my good man, anywhere.
Er... thank you for the tea and cakes.
I shall taste them all through my dissection class.
Would you say your work is in the nature of a vocation?
No, no, not quite. My grandfather wished it.
He believes that if one cannot join the ruling classes, one must do one's best to deplete them.
Well...
Who is it?
Finsbury? Name of Finsbury, ma'am?
- Yes?
- There's a shipment for you, ma'am.
Cousin Morris must have excelled himself.
We're always having shipments of eggs, but never anything like this before.
A little assistance would not be refused, ma'am.
If the staff were available.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, allow me to help.
Oh, won't you miss your class?
Oh, that's of no consequence.
I doubt if my class will miss me.
- Would you hold my coat?
- Oh...
Dr Pratt?
Dr Pratt?
Dr Pratt?
Are you Dr Pratt?
What? What?
Are you Dr Pratt?
Are you?
Are you from the police?
- No.
- Then I am Dr Pratt, yes.
I was referred to you by a slight acquaintance... for professional advice.
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, mm.
Is it? Is it night or day?
Day.
Did you have an appointment to see me, sir?
I'm afraid not.
Then I will give you a day appointment immediately.
Thank you very much.
Sit in that chair.
Don't sit on that moggy, sir.
She's the finest ratter in the East End.
- I'm terribly sorry.
- That's all right.
Quiet, Tiger.
Now, then, take off your clothes, sir... and cough.
Doctor, it's not me.
It's certainly not me, sir.
It's probably one of my cats.
- Doctor!
- Come in!
- Come in!
- Doctor!
I am not here on a matter of my personal health.
Would you be so good, sir, as to er... say that again?
I did not come here for reasons of my personal health.
What is the young lady's name?
- It is not that, Doctor.
- No, no, it isn't, no.
- I wanted to make a somewhat unusual request.
- Yes, yes.
I was wondering... do you by any chance... happen to have any...
...death certificates?
Do I happen to have any death certificates?
What a monstrous thing, sir.
What a monstrous thing to say to a member of the medical profession!
You realise the enormity of what you have just said?
Yes.
Do you have any death certificates?
- How may do you want?
- Just the one would be sufficient.
Ah.
And if you'd be so good as to simply sign your name and leave the remainder blank...
It'll cost you five shillings.
Price is no object.
Right, ten shillings, then, payable in advance.
Stay there, I'll just get my medical pen.
Sorry, Button.
I keep them here. Yes.
Oh! Would you like to buy a moggy?
No, thank you, Doctor.
They make lovely pets.
You'd like to have a moggy in the home.
I collect eggs, Doctor.
Eggs? Oh, yes, I enjoy an egg myself.
Yes, they don't make god pets, though.
You can never get 'em in at night.
They're too quiet. Yes.
All I want is a death certificate, Doctor.
Don't we all? Yes, yes.
Yes, indeed.
Erm... you may return for it this evening.
I will have one of my staff collect it from the place of its origin.
Meanwhile, keep taking the pills.
This evening, Doctor.
Take them this evening it's as good a time as any, yes.
That's better.
Of course, I was not always as you see me now.
I am sure you weren't, Doctor.
No, I had a magnificent practice in the fair confines of Camden Town.
A charming area.
The sick and groggy travelled from all over the world to queue at my door.
Wonderful work.
I specialised, you see, in rare, malign diseases of the spleen.
How very interesting.
The accolade itself was not beyond my grasp.
- Within it, I'm sure.
- Yes.
Until that unfortunate episode with the Lord Mayor's wife.
Goodbye, Doctor.
Come in. Come in.
We are both old enough to know what kisses lead to.
- Oh, yes.
- And if I may be blunt, our children would be idiots.
Why? Is there insanity in your family?
What? Oh, no, no.
What I mean is, it is a proved medical fact that marriage between cousins...
Oh, but we're not cousins.
Uncle Joseph is just my guardian.
I am an orphan.
- An orphan?
- Yes.
Oh, me, too. I never knew my parents.
They were killed in a balloon ascension.
I only knew mine vaguely.
My father was a missionary.
He was eaten by his Bible class.
- And your mother?
- She too.
They never eat one without the other.
Oh, it's... it's destiny!
Oh.
Stop!
Have you just made a delivery to number 11?
That's right, sir. Yeah.
Thank you.
Ah, cousin.
How is your dear grandfather this morning?
- Oh, she's well.
- What?
That is to say, he's just the same - my grandfather, of course.
Well, I must be off to my Bible class.
Cousin... I mean, Julia.
Master Michael, sir, come quickly!
Your granddad! Come quickly!
Oh... Dr Slattery.
- Am I too late?
- No, no, no. I've just given him a sedative.
Is it anything serious?
As you know, I'm a medical student and I would understand a more detailed diagnosis.
I see. Well, in that case, what I think he had... to the nearest guess, technically speaking, that is, was a conniption fit.
Oh... yes.
Yes, well, don't worry about it.
Oh, what are you blubbing for, boy? Hm?
Such a good man.
Such a gentle soul to be taken from us.
- What are you talking about?
- My dear departed Uncle Masterman.
He's no more departed than you are, probably less so, judging from the last time you consulted me.
How are the boils, by the way, hm?
Disappeared?
Miss Julia.
Excuse me.
Come, Julia. Good day, cousin.
Julia?
Peacock?
What is this? I thought they'd all gone.
I took it to be Lady Pitman's goods returned, sir.
Oh, dear.
A perfect day ruined.
Dead.
Peacock!
Peacock...
- Uncle Joseph...
- Oh, yes, I forgot to tell you.
He came and went.
- Came and went?
- Yes.
It was terrible, sir.
- Oh, terrible, it was.
- What was?
The altercation between them.
- Altercation?
- Yes, terrible.
Things flying around.
Words, angry words.
And objects.
Objects?
Peacock...
...Grandfather has murdered Uncle Joseph...
And then suffered a conniption fit.
No, never say...
And he did it because he wanted me to have the tontine.
Mercy on us.
See for yourself, Peacock.
See for yourself.
No.
What shall we do, Master Michael?
What shall we do?
There's only one thing to do, Peacock.
We must inform the police.
But your grandfather's good name, sir?
I shall say I did it.
No. I am an old man.
Let me say I did it.
- What was your motive?
- Money.
- They'd never believe you.
- Why not, sir?
After all, I haven't been paid for seven years.
Begging your pardon, sir.
No, Peacock.
It's a noble gesture... but I shall plead guilty to the crime.
But think of your career, sir.
You have your whole life before you.
Yes, there is that, of course.
Well, we must think of something else, then.
Who is it?
I don't know, sir. Shall I ask?
I don't know.
Could it be the police already?
- I don't know. Do they work that fast?
- I don't know.
Hello?
Oh, it's Miss Julia.
Listen, listen, listen.
Take your time getting to the door.
Coming!
I'll slow it down a bit.
Thank you.
I've brought some broth for Uncle Masterman.
My Uncle Joseph says it has strong recuperative qualities.
Oh.
Hello.
Oh...
Oh, I've brought a little sustenance for your dear grandfather.
I thought that...
Oh.
What is it?
Oh.
You haven't any furniture.
- What?
- Oh, how sad.
I always knew you were poor, but I never imagined anything like this.
- Oh, really?
- Would you mind if I looked around?
- Would you like to look around the hallway?
- I've always wanted an empty room of my own.
Ours is so cluttered.
We have lots of empty rooms.
Would you like to see another one?
Oh!
Oh, how sad.
All you've got left is your piano.
- I learned the pianoforte as I child, but...
- Oh, yes?
...I can never practise.
- No.
Cousin Morris will not a permit an instrument in the house.
He says the vibrations might shatter his eggs.
Yes, of course.
I think you'll find the piano's rather out of tune.
Oh, I'm sure not.
My repertoire is somewhat limited, I'm afraid.
I think I hear my grandfather calling me.
No, I don't think so.
I'm terribly sorry.
It must be cousin Morris calling you.
Yes, that must be it.
In either case, it's one or the other.
And I think we ought see which one of them wants to see which one of us.
- Goodbye.
- Oh!
Oh.
Forgive me!
What to do, Peacock?
What to do? That's the question.
If I may be allowed to say, sir.
Anything, Peacock, anything.
I have heard that there are, in certain sectors of this great city, men...
...unscrupulous men, sir, who, for a price, will perform the most unsavoury tasks.
Dr Pratt?
Rouse yourself, Dr Pratt.
I assure you, the lady was already dead, when I arrived, Constable.
- Dr Pratt.
- Come in. Hm?
I was here earlier. You asked me to return.
What?
Oh, yes. Yes, yes. I remember.
- I've got what you wanted.
- Thank you, Doctor.
Blackcurrant jelly.
It contains 12 grains of arsenic.
Just spread it on your mother's bread and butter.
Doctor, I wanted a death certificate!
Oh, you've done her in already, have you?
- What's this? Is that it?
- Mm? What?
- What's that?
- Oh, yes, this is...
- This is a death certificate.
- Yes.
- I've signed a lot of these in my time.
- Could you sign this one?
Yes, yes, I'll sign this one.
- Give me a hand.
- Up you get, Doctor.
Yes. Yes.
Oh, yes. Before I sign this,
I must do my ablutions according to the sterile principles laid down by Lord Lister:
"Cleanliness in all things, even the humblest of tasks. "
Oh, that's better.
Now, then.
Oh, look at that. Look at that! Scarcely human.
- I'll have to see a vet about it.
- Doctor...
- Come in.
- Come on!
Keep taking the pills. You'll be all right.
- Are you all right, Doctor?
- Yes, I'm all right. It's just a fur ball.
It's nothing.
Strange. I haven't had fur for a fortnight.
Now, let's see...
Now... Yes. Er... That's it.
There they are.
- Doctor...
- Mm?
Oh, you want it signed in two places? Yes.
Yes.
P.
- P, Doctor. P.
- Oh, yes.
- P.
- R.
- R...
... A- T-T.
Oh.
MD.
"Pratt MD". Is that your name, as well?
Oh, I've gone and blotted it, now.
It's a small world.
You'd never think that there were two Pratts in one room, would you?
There we are.
- Thank you, Doctor. Good night.
- Yes. Come in.
Of course, you know...
...I was not always as you see me now.
Was I, Mervin, eh?
Oh, no, you are too young to remember.
Stay away, lad. It's not good for you.
Julia!
Are you mad?
A scream like that might have shattered my eggs.
Oh, but I was dreaming I was an egg, Morris, and that an eagle was trying to hatch me.
- Please cover yourself.
- Oh...
What erm...
What news of next door?
Oh, well, very peculiar, Morris.
I took Uncle Masterman some broth and Michael... Well, he seemed to...
How shall I say it? I... I think he threw me out.
- Threw you out?
- Yes! What do you think it means, Morris?
Well, it means that erm...
What it means is that erm...
I... don't know what it means.
Morris, am I pretty?
Let me think.
Oh... Never mind.
He's up to something.
It's happened. I know it's happened.
And Michael's trying to cheat us.
Trying to cheat two orphans out of the tontine.
That must be it!
Peacock? Peacock!
Where is the old fool?
The house is full of fools!
I'm coming, blast you!
I'm coming! I'm coming!
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
I'm... Oh! Aagh! Oh!
I'll turn the cart round and stand guard.
Hey...
- Funny.
- Funny, Daddy.
What's all this malarkey about a piano, then?
Still, he must be the one. Can't be two in the same house, can there?
Come on, let's get him wrapped up now.
Here, you take his legs, I'll take his shoulders.
Right, well, thanks for the business, sir.
Good night.
You, there!
- Where are you going with that?
- Er... Chelsea Undertakers, sir.
We have a dead person what has just deceased.
I see. Well, be about your sacred business.
Thank you, sir.
The compliments of the night to you, sir.
And so, gentlemen, the great tontine has been won after 63 years by your uncle erm... Joseph of Finsbury.
Yes, we've telegraphed him in Bournemouth.
He will erm... arrive shortly.
- A most magnificent sum!
- Erm... could we ask... just how magnificent?
Oh, yes. Well, it's the magnificent total of
£111,000 three shillings and thruppence.
We could continue to administer the fund.
No, no, no, no, no.
Erm... my uncle gave quite explicit instructions.
He wants the entire amount handed over to him.
- Oh?
- In cash.
- Immediately.
- Oh. That is most unusual.
Oh, well. However...
Well, in that case...
...would it be convenient for you to return, say, at three o'clock?
Ah! We were thinking more immediately than that.
Erm... Unless, of course, our new legal friend could bring it to the house.
Yes, that would suit. You see, this is sure to prove a trying day for our dear uncle.
Mm! The shock of losing a brother, you see.
Plus the shock of winning the tontine
- might prove too much for his... weak...
- Terribly weak.
...heart.
- Mm!
That's no good. Here! Give it to me.
Leave it, leave it, leave it! Give it to me.
Now, this time. This time, pull!
- Pull!
- You know what that is?
That is stuck. That is what that is.
Is this the Finsbury residence?
- Who asks?
- Kindly address me as "Major".
- Are you a member of this household?
- The butler, Major.
Does your employer answer to the name of Masterman Finsbury?
That was the case, Major.
Then he is delivered up and safely returned.
This poor, misguided man attempted to take his own immortal life last night.
- We fished him out of the river.
- Mercy!
Yes? Did somebody call?
Later, Mercy. Later! First things first.
Pass him through.
Come along! Come along!
Now, you two, give a hand. Come along!
Get the piano out of the way!
Come on, get moving! Get moving!
- Where is he usually kept?
- First door.
Forward, the Army!
Take him upstairs.
You ought to count yourself lucky we were on our toes last night.
The Lord moves in mysterious ways when He is raising money for our cause.
He will have to move very mysteriously...
...to raise any boodle here.
Boodle? What do you mean?
I am not in charge of the finances.
You have to wait till Master Michael returns.
We can wait.
- Agh, Master Michael! Oh, poor!
- Ha!
Here, that boy!
- Do you want to earn a penny?
- Yeah.
Here, go to St Mary's hospital.
- Ask for Mr Michael Finsbury.
- Michael Finsbury?
Good morning.
May I be of service in your hour of need?
Oh... Oh, yes, I've come to pay my respects.
Who, may I ask, do you suffer the sad loss of?
My uncle, Masterman Finsbury.
Finsbury?
"Finsbury" as in "Park"?
No, the only soul reposing here belongs and answers to the name
Wilfred Ebenezer Hackett.
Oh. Well, Uncle was called many names, but that was never one of them.
- When did your uncle die?
- Late last night.
In that case, allow me to present you with my card.
Er... Er...
Oh, I appear to have run out.
Business is so brisk these days!
It is quite obvious, my dear young lady, that you are in need of my entire organisation.
When you leave me at the undertakers', go back to the house, unpack Uncle and place him in the hallway, so that it appears he fell down the stairs.
Why do I always have the packing and unpacking to do?
You're quite right. I can't trust you with the simplest task. I'd better handle it.
We haven't got much time.
Here we are. Get out!
Tell the undertakers, a simple coffin.
Nothing expensive!
Now, if you'll excuse me, Miss Finsbury.
Brothers and sisters, our prayers were for nought.

- Michael Finsbury, sir?
- I know, I know!
Michael Finsbury, naturally.
- Bring that down, will you?
- Right, sir.
Mr Patience.
- What means this?
- Our dead uncle.
My cousin should never have broken the glad news at the top of the stairs.
- Why? What happened?
- Well, the poor old chap...
...broke his noodle.
- I see. You mean it... it proved fatal?
Oh, totally. Excuse me.
Allow me.

Excuse me.

Where is Uncle Joseph?
- I say, she's a bit of all right!
- "Where is Uncle Joseph," indeed, you cretin!
- I sent him to you in a barrel!
- Oh? What's this?
- You realise we're ruined?
- I think I know what's happened.
- There's been a mix-up.

Pray, what is going on? Hmm?

Well, here today and gone tomorrow.
Surely a mere formality, sir?
You have our words as English gentlemen that our uncle is... no longer with us.
I wonder... I wonder if you could give us a few more moments alone with him

- Please indulge yourself.

Well, in that case, perhaps it'd be as well if I returned another day for the transfer of the...

I did not kill my brother Joseph!
I tried to, but I failed.

The point is, the tontine is ours!
Well, it certainly isn't yours and it must be returned!

You couldn't take it back now!
You gave it to us. It's ours!

It is, as you know, a statistical fact that in London one person dies every 25 seconds, which means it is extremely probable that one of us may not even live to arrive at the cemetery.
Morris, I think there's been another mix-up.
- We've got a body instead of the boodle.
- What?
We must go to the cemetery!
Quick. Get the flag. They'll never notice.
I will recall, Mrs Hackett, that your late husband showed me another kindness on February 3rd.
- No, February 4th. Another kindness, by...
- And it was kind of him to pass on, wasn't it?
Wasn't it? Gave you a better chance of the tontine! Hypocrite! You hypocrite!
Don't touch me!
Now, come, Mrs Hackett.
You mustn't spoil this beautiful occasion.
Perfidious! How dare...
What have you done with Mr Hackett?
Look at the size of that coffin!
That's only part of him! He weighed 15 stone.
And look at that ridiculous flag!
He hated England!
Excuse me, you have our body.
Erm... our Yorkshire terrier.
He would have been 14 tomorrow.
Poor little beggar.
Hey! Get back!
Excuse... Excuse me!
Stop! Thief! Stop! Thief!
Let us remember where we are!

- Aargh!
- Oh!
Oh, my!
Uncle...
That's him.
Please. May we begin?
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the sight of God and in the face of this congregation to join this man and this woman...
No, no - that's not it. Er... Er...
- Aah!
- Ugh!
I must have quiet! I demand the silence due this solemn occasion!
Uncle Joseph!
- Just where you belong, Jo-jo.
- Oh!
Please! I beg of you, sir!
- Get off him, all of you!
- Ladies! Gentlemen!
I beg of you to conduct your business elsewhere.
- What do you mean, elsewhere?
- Not you, of course, Mrs Hackett.
Uncle Joseph.
Let us begin...
Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery.
He cometh up and is cut down like a flower.
He fleeth as it were a shadow and never continueth in one stay.
In the midst of life, we are in death.
- Of whom may we seek for succour...
- Stop! Stop this funeral.
I demand the money to be returned.
The tontine has yet to be won.
If fate names me the winner, the entire amount goes to my ward, Julia.
Julia, my darling, I've always loved you.
Be mine tonight.
Better still, be mine.
Let us begin. Man that is born of woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery.
What's going on? What is it? Come on.
Please, sir, I beg of you.
There's a dead man here.
All right, no-one move!
- Finsbury?
Yes?
- Morris Finsbury?
- Yes.
Morris Finsbury, I arrest you for stealing £100,000.
- But the money has been returned, sir.
- And who are you, sir?
- Some sort of accomplice?
- Certainly not! I am his solicitor.
You've brought a solicitor with you, have you?
- I've met your type before.
- No, I'm the administrator of the tontine!
- "Tontine"?
- Named after Lorenzo Tonti,
- a Neapolitan banker.
- And who are you, sir?
- I...
- He's nobody. He's my young brother.
- And who are you, sir?
- None of your business.
I shall have you arrested for indecent exposure!
My grandfather was recently buried, sir.
And who are you, sir?
He is Michael Finsbury.
And who are you, madam?
She is Julia Finsbury, shortly to become...
...Julia Finsbury.
Young man, did you know there was a body in the piano?
I did it.
- Who is he?
- He is the butler, sir.
- The butler did it?
- No, sir.
- I put the body there.
- Is this true?
- Yes, sir.
- Then you are entitled to a reward of £1,000.
You are responsible for bringing the Bournemouth Strangler to his just end.
Oh, but I... I don't deserve it.
- The body just arrived in a barrel.
- I sent it.
- And who are you, sir?
- He is of diminished responsibility, Officer.
It was all my doing. If there's any justice in this naughty world, the reward is mine.
And who are you?
You remember me. Morris Finsbury.
I was falsely accused of stealing £100,000, whereas, in fact, it was me and me alone who was responsible for bringing the Bournemouth Strangler to his just deserts.
Not yet, Colonel.
Wait till you get a clear shot.
You damn fool!
I said wait!
That's not some clay animal in a fairground you're shooting at.
I'm sorry, old man.
I thought I could make it.
[SPEAKS NATIVE LANGUAGE]
What's the matter, Marchent?
It will be dark in an hour.
Can't leave it to suffer all night.
Let's go after it.
- You'd better go back to camp.
- Wouldn't you like me to come with you?
You're dead right I would. I wanted to catch one of the most dangerous animals there is.
Might teach you something.
- Marchent? I realise that while I'm on this safari, I'm your responsibility, but I think I'd like to go.
Whatever the danger.
I'm sorry, Colonel Hammond.
I had no right to shout at you like that.
But the animals in this country are part of my life.
And I hate to see them abused in any way.
You go back to camp.
Your daughter should be arriving tonight.
You must be there to meet her.
All right, David. If you think it's best.
Good luck. See you later.
Right. Come on. Let's hurry.
Release the antelope.
Bwana! Look here.
- We can't be far behind.
- Look!
What is it?
It is the sign of the sacred
White Rhino, that guards the entry into the lands of the Kunaka.
Wait bwana!
You would enter their lands?
Well, we haven't come this far to be turned back by a primitive tree carving.
But here the Devils of Darkness are all about us!
The Deils of waht?
The spirits of the past that protect the forest lands, from the desecration of unworthy eyes.
- They won't come with us?
- They dare not.
And you?
Do you believe in this?
Then wait here.
Malinga. Peace to you.
You are on the hallowed hunting ground of the Kunaka.
No hunter is allowed her.
I only came to end the suffering of this wounded beast.
Your presence has disturbed the spirit of the White Rhinoseros.
He who watches over you would understand.
Can you not also forgive me?
That is for our leaders to decide, but it is written, that whenever the pale ones return, they must die.
Come!
[CHANTS IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]
You who have entered the sacred lands and disturbed the tormented spirits, must die.
- Is there no defence I can offer?
- None.
For your fate was sealed in the dark days of the past, when this area was the domain of the rare White Rhinoseros.
In that time, tribes of the primitive white races came from the far north.
And having no fear of and no respect for our religion, entered this area and senselessly slaughtered the sacred beasts.
Instead of falling upon them and killing them for this sacrilege we of the Kunaka accepted their false idol and entered into a hideous pact with them.
In this, we displeased our gods, who placed us in spiritual bondage, until the White Rhinoseros itself reappears!
Or until the false idol shatters.
Until such time as either of these signs from the god appears, all who enter the sacred land must die!
Don't be afraid.
Let me help you.
I was trying to help her.
Who are you?
The White Rhino.
Your clothes are different. You are different.
Can you speak our tongue?
Yes.
Where do you come from?
A land far from here.
- Why did you come?
- I...
I can only believe the Fates brought me here.
Then they brought you to me!
Take him!
I'm sorry I had to hurt you.
- What is your name?
- They call me Saria.
- Mine is David.
- You came to help us?
If I can.
Tell me something about this place, Saria.
It is our prison...
This room will be yours.
So when we met out there in the jungle, you were trying to escape?
Yes.
But there is no escape from Kari.
We are her slaves.
Slaves?
How long has it been like this?
- For as lomg as I can remember.
- Why not rebel?
You make it sound so easy.
She's not only protected by the timeless ones, but beyond...by the devils.
Devils?
Yes. They are everywhere.
Who are they?
They are our guardians.
They shield us from the cruel world outside.
In return, at each new moon, one of us must wed them.
The bride is never seen again.
It is our fate.
No one must accept such a fate, Saria.
Are there no men here to help you?
- But you said you had come to help us.
- But your men, where are they?
They are no longer men.
Take her!
I did not save you for others, strange one.
You're mine, and mine alone.
Think on this.
Bring the stranger to me.
Now there are two mouths that eat before we get ours!
We are hungry, also!
If you choose to have your food upon the ground, then let it be so.
Now you may eat.
- I will tear the heart from her!
- Now is not the time.
Look at her! She eats upon a throne while we grovel in the dust.
We are not beasts of the field.
We are women, equal to her!
You are wrong.
You are my slaves.
Let her go.
Let the dancing continue.
Permit me, my queen, to speak.
Speak slave.
The women are sad, and when the heart is heavy the feet are not light.
Let there be no more dancing.
You heard my command. Dance!
- You refuse me!
- What else can you expect?
Your heartless cruelty is sickening.
You'd have me otherwise?
What makes you so cruel?
Cruelty has made me cruel.
I was once their slave.
Before the Devils came we dark ones were in bondage to the fair ones.
You would have pitied me then, a meek, cringing creature.
You would have pitied me, but you would not have wanted me.
- I don't want you now.
- Why not?
Must a woman always be subservient to a man to be wanted?
No.
You suggest we should be equals?
Yes.
Then I offer you equality.
Share my throne and my kingdom with me.
If you abandon the harshness of your regime, yes, I could accept your offer.
You see!
Already you want to impose your will!
You want to dominate me.
I'd be a fool to let any man do that again.
But you will want me- and on my terms1
Never.
I am queen here.
I will not be denied.
You will never rule me.
Then like the others, you will become my slave.
Take him!
Tomorrow you will learn what happens to those who try to master me.
A devil!
Poor Saria. She's too young to have sufferred so.
The let this be your lesson.
Many more of us will have to suffer if you persist in this seneless search for freedom..
There is no escape.
Lie still, little one.
- Is he safe? Have they hurt him?
- Who?
The stranger.
The one that came to help us.
Don't expect too much from him.
Kari has taken him for her own.
He has not resisted.
I don't believe you.
He wouldn't betray me.
Do you still refuse me?
Let us see what a visit in there will do to weaken your resolve.
You- on the bellows!
Who are you? Where are you from?
How did you come here?
Silence, you senile old fool.
The sooner you join your ancestors and your stupid tongue is silenced forever, the happier I shall be!
Work!
- He hates yoy. Why?
- The man he used to hate died last week.
He needs someone new.
They all hate.
It keeps them alive.
- You do not hate?
- I am too old.
Even for hatred.
Silence! Quiet!
Work.
Let the ceremony of selection begin.
It won't help.
The selection has been made.
The bride will be...
Amyak!
No!
Do not look upon us with such disgust.
We too were once a civilised people.
It's hard to believe now.
It was so when we first came to the sacred land of the White Rhinoseros.
Even where I have come from,
I have heard much of this legend.
Tell me, how did it begin?
Our forefather's brought us here.
We were not superstitious like the others.
We hunted the White Rhinoseros until it finally became extinct.
Then we erected a false image to make others believe that it still lived.
In this way we offended the gods, and the legend was born.
They sent us a tribe of dark people, who came here looking for sanctuary.
For our protection...
They were less intelligent people, and instead of nurturing them, we made them our slaves.
This easing of our daily burden made us soft and thoughtless to the well-being of others.
One day, a young slave girl escaped.
She went to the most barbaric of the neighbouring tribes, those who call themselves the
'Devils of Darkness'.
She betrayed our secrets.
No longer fearing the spirit of the
White Rhinoseros, the devils fell upon us.
Our women were enslaved.
The men put in here... and that young slave girl was made our queen.
A more evil woman could not have been chosen.
How could she know better?
The evil within her was put there by us!
Our own selfishness and greed had grown tenfold on fertile soil, and had turned against us.
These false doctrines that we have created will be washed from the minds of men.
No. You're wrong.
The legend will not die.
Then we can only pray for the forgiveness of the gods.
For the legend is that we must all remain in spiritual bondage,
Until the White Rhino itself reappears, and the false idol rent asunder.
They must not take Amyak away from us now.
- We must rebel.
- Let us rise up.
Without Amyak, we are lost.
- She is our leader...
- No!
You must take no action!
You're not ready yet.
You must only choose a new leader.
Let Saria lead you after I am gone.
Any form of resistence means death.
- Then you won't join us?
- We must all be bride someday.
It si our destiny.
Only the gods can change one's destiny, and you are not gods.
We must go to the stranger.
He will help us.
How can he help you, little one?
He's imprisoned with the other men.
- He's not like other men.
- To you he isn't.
He's not like other men, and it is Kari who desires him!
If he were to become her man, he could use his position in helping us destroy her.
And could you agree to allowing this stranger to become- Kari's man?
I must agree, for all our sakes.
- Are you not afraid?
- Yes, little one. I am afraid.
- Don't wake the others.
- Why are you here?
The women are ready to rebel, but we need your help.
How can I help?
Kari must be watched by somebody close to her.
- You could be that person.
- Me?
It is known that you have refused her, but, if you would change your mind?
- Do you know what you're asking?
- Yes.
Yes, I know what, but you must help us.
Please, promise me that you will.
How can I refuse you?
Don't be sad.
When this is over, we'll be together.
No, when this is over, you will leave us.
I will never leave you.
The legend foretells, that when the stranger comes to free us, and his task is done, he will return to his own land... alone.
I won't leave you.
I must go.
That woman... is she your special woman?
Yes.
I had forgotten about such things.
- On my terms, completely?
- Yes.
- You will run my household?
- Yes.
- Look after my clothing?
- Yes.
- Mix my perfumes?
- Yes.
In fact you will do everything that I ask?
Yes.
Fetch me my robe.
Why do you hesitate?
It will take me a little time to...
You must learn that each command must be obeyed at once.
Come.
My body hungers.
Bring food and drink to my chambers.
No!
I release you from your promise.
What promise?
There is no promise.
He fulfills your desires only because
I made him promise that he would.
Is this true?
She is confused.
She doesn't know what she is saying.
- Is it true?
- He did it for all our sakes!
Take him to the cavern, and never let him see daylight again!
Never! Never! Never!
Bring her!
Never! Never! Never! Never!
Look at her. Look!
For you'll never see her again.
Never! Never!
The Devils are here.
They've come for a bride.
Why did you stop him?
I couldn't bear to see him humiliated any more.
And yet to save him you've condemned yourself- and us.
While he and the other men still live, you must not lose hope.
The men! What use are they?
Better they were dead.
They've become beasts.
You must think of the men, not as enemies, but as friends.
Then together you will conquer.
It is the only way.
No! Nobody can stand it!
He's right.
Pain won't last long.
Let us try again.
- You must stop!
- No!
Not until we are free.
Are we free?
Yes.
The gods are kind.
My one prayer was to die free.
Am I free?
I... I am free!
I am...free.
Quickly! There is work to be done!
After them!
Victory is ours. Stop!
You don't have the time to go in there!.
The jungle is their home.
- Kill her!
- After them!
Kill them all! They dare to rebel against me! Kill them all!
Kill them all!
- David! David!
-Saria!
Look!
Stop!
He is our god.
He will not harm us.
We won't need them any more.
You don't think they'll come back?
No. The legend...
It's partly fulfilled.
I don't care what the legend says.
I won't leave you.
My world is not yours.
This much I understand.
- How can you know that?
- You came to help us and your task is finished.
And now you must leave.
Saria!
Are we never to be together?
Not until the gods who watch over us wish it to be so.
I love you.
And my love for you will last forever.
It is fulfilled.
The legend of the White Rhinoseros is fulfilled!
At last we are free.
Our souls are no longer in bondage.
We are free!
Free! We are free! Free!
Our gods chose you to free us from this burden that has tormented us through the ages.
The Kunaka will be eternally grateful.
The temple of the false idol must be destroyed!
What happened, bwana,
I thought you were in danger?
- Jakara, how long was I in there?
- Only for one moment.
One moment...
What happened?
I'm not sure.
There was a sheet of lightning.
What has happened to them?
They are not as fierce a tribe as you would have me believe, Jakara.
I think it safer we get back to camp.
Pity David didn't get that leopard, m'dear.
The skin would have made a nice present for our daughter.
John... Did you notice anything strange about Mr. Marcheant when he came back?
Can't say I did. Why?
He had a sort of farawy look in his eye.
- Almost as if he...
- Excuse me, bwana.
- The others are coming.
- Splendid. Tell Mr. Marchent.
Wonder if they've got some
English newspapers.
The others have come, bwana.
Thank you.
I'll be out in a moment.
John!
- David.
- Hello. Good journey?
Fine, David. Fine.
Hope I haven't missed any excitement here?
No. Not really.
Come on then.
Come and meet the new people.
Mr. and Mrs Perkins, from London.
Mrs. Perkins. Mr. Perkins.
And Mr. Peter O'Donnell.
Mr. O'Donnell.
Please make yourselves at home.
My head boy will show you the sleeping arrangements.
There's another one here, somewhere.
Ah, there she is.
Oh, Sarah, I'd like you to meet
Mr. David Marchent.

(BOTH IMITATING
CAR ENGINE)
Hang on, we're coming to a bend.
You're going too fast!
No, I'm not. Hang on!
What's this heap of old iron doing here?
Old iron?
I'll give you
10 bob for it.
Don't be daft.
This was once a great car.
Won the Grand Prix three years running.
So it's a car, is it?
Certainly it's a car.
It's a racing car.
And we're winning.
And you're in the way.
And you're in the way for a right belt around the ear, young man, if I have any more of your lip.
All right.
I'll give you
15 bob for it.
Make it 30 bob, and she's yours.
Mr. Coggins, you're not going to sell her, are you?
Of course he's gonna sell her.
What do you think he's running here, a children's playground or something?
All right, 30 bob.
I'll pick her up Wednesday.
But, Mr. Coggins, you promised we could play in her.
Well, I'm sorry, my dears, but she ain't any use to me.
Times are hard.
But you can't take her away.
She's not just any old car.
She's ours.
Not anymore, she ain't.
I'll see you tomorrow, Bill.
Giddy-up!
What're you going to do with her?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do with her, we're gonna put her in the clapper and we're gonna crunch her up till she's one solid piece of metal.
Then we're gonna put her in a fiery furnace, and we're gonna melt her down till she's liquid iron.
That's what we're gonna do with her.
Now look what you've done.
You've frightened her.
She shivered.
See? She's a very special car.
If you put her in the fiery furnace, you'll be guilty of murder.
Yeah, and if you don't get out of it,
I'll be guilty of two more murders.
Now go on, out of it.
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
Please, Mr. Coggins, you can't sell our lovely car to that nasty man.
Well, I'm sorry, children, but I'm afraid
I already have.
I know!
Daddy will buy it for us.
Won't he, Jemima?
Of course he will.
Mr. Coggins, promise you won't let her go until we come back.
Well, 30 shillings, mind.
Not a penny less.
Please promise.
Please.
All right, I promise.
Come on, Jemima.
Well, that's a clever thing to do!
We're very sorry, miss.
I'm sure you are.
Well, just look at my car.
And just look what a mess I'm in, too.
Oh, no, I think you're beautiful.
And I like your car.
Hmm.
Just the same, you shouldn't be rushing across the road like that.
You know, you might have been killed.
Anyway, why aren't you in school?
It isn't a holiday, is it?
No, miss.
Do you live around here?
Yes, we live just down the road.
Come on, get into my car,
I'm taking you home.
Gosh, just wait till
Daddy hears we've been for a ride in a motorcar!
Yes!
What's your name?
I'm Jemima.
And I'm Jeremy.
What's yours?
Truly.
That's a very pretty name.
Now, where is your house?
Oh, we don't live in a house.
We live in the castle on top of the hill.
A castle? I didn't know there were any castles around here.
Well, it isn't a castle exactly.
That's what
Daddy calls it.
He says King Alfred used to live there hundreds of years ago.
And does your daddy know you aren't in school?
Oh, he won't mind.
He never does.
Anyway, he's awfully busy.
Is he?
Well, he'll have to find time to see me, because I have a few things to say to him.
JEMlMA: Edison! Edison!
JEREMY: Come here, boy!
Good boy, good boy.
That's Daddy over there.
JEMlMA: Hello!
JEREMY: Hello!
Hello.
You're just in time.
What on earth is he up to?
JEMlMA: That's his latest invention.
Rockets.
Rockets?
Stand back!
Keep clear!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Does he know what he's doing?
Of course he does.
Whoa!
Well, I don't see anything funny.
Somebody should do something about it.
Hold on! Hold on!
Wait! Wait there.
Oh!
Thank you!
I should hope so.
You might have gone up in flames.
Madam, I took that into consideration.
This suit is completely flameproof.
Oh, dear.
You have just succeeded in ruining my propulsion unit.
But how was l to know that you were. . .
Don't be cross with the lady, Daddy.
JEREMY: She gave us a ride in her car.
JEMlMA: She was only trying to help.
How very kind.
Her name's Truly.
That's nice.
Do you realize,
Mr. Potts, that I nearly knocked down your two children?
Well, we do seem to be accident-prone, don't we?
But it wasn't my fault.
You see, they came rushing out. . .
Oh, well, it was very, very nice of you to apologize.
Apologize?
Tea time, children.
Bye-bye, Truly.
Thanks for the ride.
Just a moment, you two.
Don't you have something to tell your father?
Yes, we have.
Daddy, Mr. Coggins promised us. . .
But she didn't mean about that.
Daddy, we didn't go to school today.
Oh-ho.
Well, it'll give the other children a chance to catch up, won't it?
Run along, children.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Bye, Truly.
Come on, Edison.
But, Mr. Potts. . .
Good day!
But, but. . .
Unstable.
Definitely unstable.
Good afternoon, miss.
Sorry I can't stop.
I'm off to India.
Going to have a cup of tea with the Maharajah. Cheerio!
Mr. Potts.
I'm sorry to persist about this, but perhaps you simply aren't aware that your children were running about in the road.
And after all, you know, it's not a playground.
It's very. . .
Would you mind just pressing that switch there?
Switch?
Yes, just behind you.
On the right.
The right.
The right?
Thank you.
You really ought to try and exercise more control over them.
Yes, I suppose I could chain them up, couldn't l?
On a nice long chain, of course, so they get plenty of exercise.
Mr. Potts, don't your children go to school?
Oh, I have it now.
You're the truant officer.
No, I'm not the truant officer.
Well, didn't you ever play truant?
I mean, just once?
No, I most certainly did not.
I bet you didn't.
Would it be too much to ask what this is, this, um, thing?
A little invention of mine, cleans carpets by suction.
All that to clean carpets?
Away with sweeping, and away with brushing, and away with dirty carpets.
Is that all you do,
Mr. Potts? Invent things?
Is that all I do?
And what's this gadget?
Well, that's not quite right yet, but eventually,
I hope to transmit moving pictures by wireless.
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
That's my. . .
And this?
This, madam, is a sweet-making machine.
And is this one of the sweets?
Yes, it is.
And is it supposed to have all those holes in it?
No. Actually, I think that the problem is. . .
The boiling point of your sugar is too high.
Oh, we're an expert on sweet-making, are we?
Well, as a matter of fact. . .
And an expert on child welfare.
I was only trying to help your children.
Well, maybe my children like running wild in the street.
Did that ever occur to you?
I do not see any cause to. . .
And in any case, how my children behave is frankly no concern of yours.
I was merely trying. . .
So, if you'll be so good as to take yourself off in that fancy automobile of yours and go do good somewhere else.
Well, I've never been. . .
Spoken to that way before?
Well, maybe it's about time.
Good afternoon, madam.
Mind the cable!
Vicious, interfering. . .
If women are going to drive motorcars around, they should learn to operate one correctly.
Well, I suppose it wouldn't occur to you to offer to help me.
Get in the car. Please.
Well, for a mechanically-minded man,
Mr. Potts. . .
Try switching it on.
Oh.
Hmm!
Open the throttle!
And keep it open!
Women!
Confounded woman!
Who does she think she is?
Coming in here and telling me how to raise my children.
Do I need somebody to tell me how to raise my children?
Do l? Hmm?
No, of course not.
Of course not!
Where's my cardigan?
Under your jacket.
Under. . . Yes.
Self-righteous busybody.
She won't be bothering us again.
But I liked her.
So did l.
She was very pretty.
She certainly was.
Do you think your father's a crackpot?
Your cardigan's inside out.
Oh.
Do you think
I'm a lunatic, wasting my time on a lot of silly inventions?
But they aren't silly.
They're wonderful.
Nobody else could think of them.
That's right. That is right.
Nobody else could think of them.
Yes. After all, what makes the battle worth the fighting?
What makes the mountain worth the climb?
What makes the questions worth the asking?
The reason worth the rhyme?
(SINGING) To me, the answer's clear
It's having someone near
Someone dear
Someone to care for
To be there for
I have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
I have you two
Someone to share joy or despair with
Whichever betides you
Life becomes a chore
Unless you're living for
Someone to tend to, be a friend to
I have you two
Someone to strive for
Do or die for
I have you two
Could be we three get along so famously
'Cause you two have me
And I have you two, too
BOTH: Someone to care for
To be there for
I have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
I have you two
Someone to smile once in a while with
Whenever you're lonesome
I've a happy lot
Considering what I've got
But I couldn't do more
Than you do for your poor father
Daddy!
Daddy!
Things go asunder
And I wonder why you bother
ALL: Could be we three
Get along so famously 'cause
BOTH: We two have you
And I have you two
Too
Jeremy.
Oh, good.
Do I smell food?
Bring the bread, will you, Grandpa.
Yes, sir! Sir! Sir!
And pepper and salt, please.
Right away, sir!
Oh!
Sausage and egg, my favorite!
How was India?
India?
I'll tell you something.
I got up this morning, and I shot an elephant in my pajamas.
How he ever. . .
ALL: Got into my pajamas,
I shall never know.
You've heard it before.
Now, I wonder how that could have happened.
Daddy, could we ask you something?
It's about Mr. Coggins.
Mr. Coggins.
You see, the junkman wanted to take it away.
But Mr. Coggins says if we asked you first. . .
Asked me what first?
He's a horrid, mean, old man.
Mr. Coggins?
No, the junkman.
He's going to take it away and put it in a furnace.
And burn it all up.
It's terrible.
What are you going on about?
BOTH: Our car!
Yes, well, what about it?
Mr. Coggins is selling it to the junkman.
And the junkman's going to put it in the fiery furnace.
And squidge it all up till there's nothing left.
Oh, well, that's terrible.
That is terrible.
We can't let that happen, Grandpa.
No, definitely not.
We knew you wouldn't let them, Daddy.
So we made Mr.
Coggins promise we could have it if you gave him
30 shillings.
Uh, 30 shillings.
JEREMY: You can give
Mr. Coggins the money in the morning, Daddy.
Yes, well, I suppose we can work something out somehow.
Good!
Hooray!
Are you all finished?
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, thank you.
Well, I think, maybe, you should go run up to bed.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my boy.
Sleep tight.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my darling.
God bless you.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
Good night, Daddy.
Yes, well, you've done it now, haven't you?
You think Coggins might do a deal?
So much a week?
Coggins? What, him down the road? Sure.
He's so mean he wouldn't light your pipe if his house was on fire.
Did you hear that?
You know what that means, don't you?
I'll be up all night, rain pouring through my bedroom roof.
Grandpa, why don't you sleep in the workshop?
It's nice and. . .
The workshop?
You promised, faithfully, to fix my bedroom roof.
I will, Grandpa.
It's just. . .
Caractacus, please.
My boy, listen.
It's time you woke up.
When I was your age,
I did a day's work. . .
For a day's pay, polishing the Colonel's boots.
I was the smartest batman in the British Army.
So you've been telling me.
When my Brigadier went into action, the fuzzy-wuzzies were so blinded by the shine on his boots, they couldn't see to fight.
Catch me death of cold.
He doesn't care.
Nobody cares.
Me own son!
She was right.
Who wants sweets with holes in them?
Oh, Edison, stop that whistling.
Edison, hey, do that again.
Edison, you're a genius.
The employment office is in the rear.
Thank you. Oh.
You see, I've invented these sweets.
Really?
Name?
Uh. . .
Whistling Sweets.
Mr. Whistling Sweets.
Not Mr. Whistling Sweets.
No, I'm Potts.
Hmm.
May I see the managing director?
Lord Scrumptious sees no one without an appointment.
CARACTACUS: Well, how do l get an appointment?
Why, hello, children.
JEMlMA: Jeremy, it's Truly.
Hello, Truly.
Good morning,
Miss Scrumptious.
How nice to see you.
Good morning, Phillips.
Please tell my father that I'm here.
But of course,
Miss Scrumptious.
Are you here on business, Mr. Potts?
Yes, Miss. . .
Father?
Truly Scrumptious.
You're his. . .
His daughter.
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, children, let's go.
But, Daddy, you haven't shown anybody your invention.
Somehow, I don't think that'll do much good.
Just a moment,
Mr. Potts.
Exactly what was it you. . .
You've seen them.
Oh, those.
But they whistle.
Whistle?
Those holes.
You just blow through them.
They're very ingenious.
Kind of a novelty.
Please go in,
Miss Scrumptious.
You can come back in three weeks' time.
Show Mr. Potts in,
Phillips.
Now?
Now.
But his Lordship said. . .
Now.
Very well.
Please follow me.
Maybe I should come back in three weeks.
Oh, Daddy!
Go on, Daddy.
All right.
And don't let him bully you.
Yes.
Mr. Potts, milord.
Potts? Who's he?
Where's me daughter?
She insisted on
Mr. Potts seeing you.
All right, don't just stand there.
What's it all about?
Sweets, sir.
I hardly thought it was nuts and bolts.
Let's have a look.
Yes.
Hurry up, man!
Yes, sir.
If I may be allowed to explain, sir.
You have exactly
20 seconds.
Yes.
Well, the fundamental novelty of these particular sweets is their musical quality.
Not only are they remarkably tasty, but due to the unique positioning of these little holes, they are capable, when blown through, of rendering a tuneful whistle.
Place your fingers over the holes and blow thus.
Tasting time, milord.
Too late. Had your chance.
Muffed it. Good morning.
Go on. Follow him.
Milord?
CARACTACUS: Sir?
Excuse me.
Sir, if I may be allowed to demonstrate.
You see, by blowing air through this hole in the center of the sweet you get a wonderful-sounding. . .
Raspberry?
No, no.
It's more like a toot, really.
Not enough fruit, too much sugar.
Yes, milord.
Prepare the peppermint.
Beautiful. Would you care to try it, sir?
Under no circumstances.
Prepare the lemon!
He's not doing very well, is he?
You know, another remarkable feature about these little sweets is that by sucking on them. . .
Throw it away!
Will you get rid of this idiot for me?
Milord. You.
. . .in perfect pitch.
They also come in strawberry, raspberry. . .
Are you still here?
. . .lemon and. . .
And pineapple.
(MOUTHING) Go on.
Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker.
And don't try a toffee or cream.
If you seek perfection in sugar confection, well, there's something new on the scene.
A mouthful of cheer, a sweet without peer.
A musical morsel supreme
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The candies you whistle
The whistles you eat
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The eatable, tweetable treats
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The toot of a flute with the flavor of fruit
Toot sweets, toot sweets
No longer need candy be mute
Don't waste your pucker on some all-day sucker
And don't try a toffee or cream
If you seek perfection in sugar confection
Well, there's something new on the scene
That mouthful of cheer
That sweet without peer
That musical morsel supreme
That musical morsel supreme
BOTH: Toot sweets, toot sweets
A bonbon to blow on at last has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
With tweetable, eatable sound
No! Take it away!
Father, please.
He likes it!
(SINGING) Their value is intrinsic
Surpass any mint stick
BOTH: Or marshmallow mouthful you munch
Though licorice is chewy
And gumdrops are gooey
And chocolate is charming to crunch
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
It's clearly the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
Is clearly the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
A bonbon to blow on at last has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The treat that's so tweetable
Lusciously eatable
With that unbeatable
Sound
Get out of here!
Go away!
What's going on?
Get those dogs out of here!
Edison, no!
Edison! Edison!
Children!
JEMlMA: Edison!
Edison!
It's entirely your fault.
I'll send for the police.
Daddy.
Now, why aren't you two asleep?
Don't be sad,
Daddy.
It wasn't your fault.
It was all those mean, old dogs.
Children, about the car. . .
You see,
30 shillings is pretty hard to come by.
And when I do get any money,
I need it for my inventions.
Well, there isn't any left.
Jeremy and l have been thinking.
It's our treasure chest.
These things are enormously valuable.
Look, an ivory tusk.
JEREMY: That must be worth a fortune.
JEMlMA: And diamonds.
And a golden crown.
It's probably
King Alfred's.
Of course, it needs cleaning up a little.
Take them, Daddy.
You can sell them.
And never mind about the car.
You can spend it all on your inventions.
Thank you, children.
All these wonderful things, they're very precious.
But I'm afraid other people wouldn't appreciate them.
Why not, Daddy?
Because other people don't see things the way you do.
Come on, now.
Let's go to bed.
And don't you worry.
Things are going to come right somehow.
(SINGING) A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay
It fills the sails of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail your worries away
It isn't far to Hushabye Mountain
And your boat waits down by the quay
The winds of night so softly are sighing
Soon they will fly your troubles to sea
So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye to cares of the day
And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay
(CIRCUS MARCH
PLAYlNG DlSTANTLY)
All the lovely colors.
Two for the price of one.
Get your balloons here!
MAN: Hurry, hurry, hurry along now.
Don't miss these lovely toffee apples!
Hurry along now!
Get your toffee apples at 8p each.
Thank you very much, young man.
Any more for any more?
Which one of you lovely ladies and gentlemen would like a splendid, automatic haircut?
I've stood in this marketplace for 25 years.
I do not profess to make dead men talk!
(LOUDLY) Hey, now, here you go then. Who's for an automatic haircut?
Only three pence a time.
You may have long hair, you may have short hair, sir, you may have straight hair, it makes no difference to the Potts automatic and hygienic, electronic hair-cutting machine!
Come on.
You could do with a haircut.
Cut me hair?
That's where me strength is.
Excuse me, sir, you look like a man who could do with a haircut.
Bah!
Yeah, go on! Go on.
Come on, sit down.
Hold that, then.
My word, you have a lot of hair.
Would you like an estimate, sir?
Very funny.
Go on, get on with it.
You just sit tight, sir, while I lower this hair-cutting machine.
There we are.
You just relax, we'll have you finished in a bit.
I feel like a real right nana sitting here.
No, you look lovely, Cyril.
It's going to be smashing.
You keep your eyes on that geezer.
Yeah, all right, then.
What's going on?
It's all right,
Cyril, it's all right.
Nothing to worry about, sir, a little friction to start.
It tickles!
Oh, you always say that, Cyril.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Cyril, you're smoking!
I'm on fire!
Stop it!
Oh!
Excuse me!
Me head's on fire!
It's all right, sir.
What you done?
Give me a mirror.
Let's have a look.
A mirror?
I'll go home and get you one.
Me hair! Look at me hair!
Where is he?
I'll kill him!
There he is, mister!
Cyril!
I'll smash your teeth down your throat!
You!
Come on, you're too fat to catch him!
Oi! Big bonce!
Get out of here.
There he is!
Get out of my way!
Oi!
Here, hurry up.
We're on.
Get out of the way!
Get out of it!
(SINGING) A gentleman's got a walking stick
A seaman's got a gaff
And the merry men of Robin Hood
They used a quarterstaff
On the Spanish plains, inside their canes
They hide their ruddy swords
But we make do with an old bamboo
And everyone applauds
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
When punting on the beautiful Thames
You use a sturdy pole
To protect their fair complexion
Ladies use a parasol
It's useful in the underbrush
To have a hefty spear
Right!
But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everybody cheer
One, two, three
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
Have a go, mate!
A flier in an aerial plane
He steers it with a stick
He does?
A collier in the pits of Wales
He leans upon his pick
That's right
Now every wheel of an automobile
Revolves around a shaft
But what we do with an old bamboo
Makes everyone go daft
And one, two
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
And a-one, two, three, four
And a-five and six and seven
Me old bamboo, me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
You can have me hat or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother with me old bamboo
You better never bother with me old bamboo
Thank you.
Here, thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
CHlLDREN: It's Daddy!
It's Daddy! He's got the car!
Look! I've got it!
He's got the car!
He's got the car!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Hello!
BOTH: The car!
What do you think of this?
Isn't she a beauty?
Oh, Daddy! Oh!
That's a nice pile of junk you got there, my boy.
Well, it needs a little work, but there's a fine engine under here.
GRANDPA: It doesn't go, though, does it?
No, not yet, but it will. It will.
You can make it go, can't you, Daddy?
Well, I'm gonna give it a try.
All right, come on, everybody, put a hand to the wheel.
George, give us a hand here, will you?
Yes, sir.
Okay, heave!
JEMlMA: We're off!
We're off! Hooray!
Comfortable, Grandpa?
Won't work, of course.
Another catastrophe.
Left hand down.
JEREMY: Come on,
Grandpa, push!
Watch it, Jeremy.
Mind the bicycle.
JEMlMA: Push.
Good. Keep coming, Jeremy.
That's it. Keep coming.
Look out, Edison.
Watch out, Edison.
Look out, Edison.
That's it.
Keep coming.
Good. Whoa! That's it.
Whoa!
All right, governor.
Many, many thanks, George.
Right.
Now. . .
Can we stay and watch, Daddy?
Yes!
No, come on, my dears, we'd better go.
You know what your dad's like when he's working.
JEMlMA: But, Grandpa, we wanted to stay and watch.
GRANDPA: Come back in the house, darling.
I'll make you a nice cup of tea.
Don't overdo it, will you, my boy?
Right, Grandpa.
You might exhaust yourself.
Come on!
"And the big brown bear
"came lolloping over the mountain.
"'No, no,' the princess cried.
"And the big brown bear came lolloping over the mountain."
It's awfully quiet in there.
Come on, children, breakfast is ready.
He's been there for days!
Will you please come and have your breakfast?
But Daddy said the car would be finished today.
Darling, you'll be waiting a month of Sundays before he's finished that.
Come on.
Be good children.
Come on.
That's Daddy!
The car.
He's finished the car!
Gosh!
Oh!
Well, what do you think of her?
JEMIMA: She's the most beautiful thing
I ever saw in my life!
It's wonderful! Oh, Daddy, you're so clever.
Oh, yes.
Can we go for a drive?
For a drive?
A drive. A drive.
I have a better idea.
How about a picnic?
BOTH: Hooray!
A picnic! A picnic.
All right?
Let's get cracking.
You get the basket out of the workshop.
Get in, Jemima.
Hooray! Hooray!
Hurry! Mind the woodwork.
Mind the woodwork.
Don't touch.
Don't touch the horn.
Here's the basket, Daddy.
Oh, yes.
Just put it on the back.
All right.
Now. Don't touch that.
BOTH: Grandfather! Come on.
We're going on a picnic.
Get aboard, Grandpa.
Come on, come on.
It'll never go, my dears.
Not if he's had anything to do with it.
But it is going!
Hooray!
Then it'll never stop.
Anyway, it's far too hot.
Where are you going?
Me? I'm off to Alaska, me boy. Cheerio!
BOTH: Goodbye, Grandpa!
Come on, Daddy!
All right.
Come on!
Come on!
We're off!
Hooray!
We're off! We're off!
Sit down, Jemima, sit down.
Are you ready?
Yes!
Here we go!
Hooray!
Mind your back, Grandpa.
Bye, Grandpa.
Nasty, smelly things, motorcars!
What a funny noise it's making!
It's talking to us.

Look out!
You'll find a slight squeeze on the hooter an excellent safety precaution,
Miss Scrumptious.
Never mind about that.
How am I supposed to get out of here?
Well, looks to me as if you have to walk.
Or swim.
What? In this dress?
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
Mr. Potts.
Come on.
(STAMMERING) What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna carry you.
Oh, dear, must you?
Well, unless you'd rather ride piggyback.
All right.
You may carry me.
Good.
Wait, wait, wait.
My handbag. Oh!
Whoa! Oh!
It's all right.
Thank you.
Not at all.
We're going to the seaside.
On a picnic.
Come with us.
Please.
Well, I'm hardly in the mood for a picnic just now.
Well, you needn't worry about your car.
I can have Mr. Coggins tow it out.
Well, I. . .
We've got sausage tarts.
And marmalade rolls.
I'm afraid I got 'em a little mixed up.
What an unusual car.
Daddy made it.
Oh. And it actually goes?
It's called
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
That's a curious name for a motorcar.
But that's the sound it makes.

BOTH: Hooray!
CHlLDREN: Hooray!
Oops!
I'm so glad you came.
It's much more fun with two grownups.
Truly Scrumptious.
You know, even if we didn't know your name, we could have guessed it.
Oh?
You had to be called something lovely.
Like Yum Yum!
Or Angel Cake.
Or Toot Sweets.
Yes. Toot Sweets.
(LAUGHS) Toot Sweets?
Oh, no.
(SINGING) Toot sweets sound like what they are
So do lollies in a lollipop jar
Gingerbread men have a gingerbread sound
We've found
Sugarplum, cinnamon, and lemon tart
Tell you what they are right from the start
And your name does the same for you
By coincidence,
Truly Scrumptious
You're truly, truly scrumptious
Scrumptious as a cherry peach parfait
When you're near us
It's so delicious
Honest, Truly
You're the answer to our wishes
Truly Scrumptious
Though we may seem presumptuous
Never, never ever go away
Our hearts beat so unruly
Because we love you truly
Aw!
Honest, Truly
We do
CHlLDREN: Daddy! Daddy!
Boo!
Truly scrumptious
You two are truly scrumptious
Scrumptious as the breeze across the bay
When you're smiling
It's so delicious
So beguiling
You're the answer to my wishes
Truly scrumptious
You two are truly scrumptious
And I shan't forget this lovely day
My heart beats so unruly
I also love you truly
Honest, truly
I do
Come on.
Hey, wait for me!
Mr. Potts.
Somebody call?
Oh. (GROANS)
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
What are you doing?
Oh, just tinkering.
Oh.
You know, Mr. Potts, you have two wonderful children.
Why, thank you.
I must agree with you there.
Isn't it beautiful?
Lovely. Just lovely.
Jeremy, it's not nice to peek.
I'm not peeking,
I'm looking.
Do you think they like each other?
Of course they do.
Do you think they're going to get married?
Has he kissed her yet?
Not yet.
Well, just as soon as he kisses her then they'll have to get married.
JEMIMA: Jeremy, what are you doing?
JEREMY: I'm keeping a lookout for pirates.
There aren't any pirates around here, are there, Truly?
Oh, I'm sure there are.
Hundreds of them.
'Course there are.
This is where they bury their treasure, isn't it, Daddy?
Mmm-hmm.
Tell us a story about pirates, Daddy.
A story about pirates, huh?
Well, let me see.
A boat!
I can see a boat!
A boat?
Did you say, "a boat"?
That isn't just any old boat out there.
No?
No?
(lN GERMAN ACCENT) No.
That is a private yacht of the notorious Baron Bomburst.
Baron Bomburst?
Baron Bomburst?
You have never heard of Baron Bomburst, ruler of Vulgaria?
The most evil man in the world!
CHlLDREN: Oh!
Yeah.
And he has sailed all the way to England because he has heard tell of a fantastic motorcar built by that brilliant inventor
Caractacus Potts.
Hooray!
Hooray!
Yes, hooray!
And he has come to steal the car and take it back to
Vulgaria with him.
CHILDREN: No!
Yeah.
MAN: (EXCLAIMS) Yes!
That car!
MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want it! I want it!
I want it! I want it!
But, Your Excellency. . .
Are you giving me an argument?
No, Your Excellency.
Stand by the boats!
Stand by the boats!
Man the grappling hooks.
Man the grappling hooks.
And load the cannon!
Load the cannon!
He's awful.
He's terrible.
Not only that, he isn't even nice.
But he can't steal our lovely car!
You won't let him, will you, Daddy?
Look!
They're getting closer.
We've got to get away!
Start the car.
Quickly, Daddy, before they get here.
Well, now, that's easier said than done.
But why, Daddy? Why?
Well, I'll tell you.
What none of us have noticed is while we've been sitting here, the tide has been coming in.
Now, we're completely cut off.
What are we going to do?
Do hurry, Mr. Potts!
Now don't panic.
Everyone, stay calm!
Quickly, Daddy.
Quickly. Hurry up.
Look! They are completely cut off by the tide.
They will all drown!
I haven't seen a good drowning in years!
Is there anything
I can do to help?
The throttle.
Push the throttle lever.
JEREMY: Hurry, Daddy! Hurry!
Quickly, Daddy, before they get here!
No, not that one, the other one!
It's no good.
It won't start!
We're gonna have to swim for it.
Come on, Jemima.
We must. Come on.
Come on, Jeremy.
We have to.
Come on, everybody over the side.
Quickly! (GASPS)
It's starting to change!
CARACTACUS:
Everybody, hold on!
TRULY: It's unbelievable!
Mr. Potts, it's so clever!
This is impossible!
But you built it!
It's a magic car.
You always said it was a magic car.
I did?
JEREMY: Yes. Look, it's like a boat!
I knew Chitty would save us!
Hang on, everybody!
We're off!
A floating car?
What do you think of that, Chancellor?
Yeah, Baron.
A car floating, floating on the water.
This, in my whole life long, it never could be seen, never, never.
It's uncategorical!
A fuel-burning oracle.
Phantasmagorical machine!
(SINGING) It's more than spectacular
To use the vernacular
It's wizard
It's smashing
It's keen
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you
And, Chitty, our Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang loves us too
High Chitty, low Chitty, anywhere we go
On Chitty Chitty we depend
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Our fine four-fendered friend
They're firing at us!
All right.
We'll show them something.
Follow that car!
Follow that car!
My word!
I want the car!
I want that car!
I must have it!
Follow the car!
Stop that car!
After them! Faster!
I want the car!
I must have it!
Action stations, everybody.
We're going ashore!
Get out!
Where are my two spies?
Ah, there you are.
Now, then, I have a secret mission for you.
You will go ashore, and you will capture that motorcar, understand?
Good.
But if you fail,
I will cut off your heads.
Out.
I want that car!
Now, then, where are we?
I have here a map.
I know where we are, stupid!
We are in England!
And when we are in England, what do we do?
We play cricket!
We play. . .
No. We dress like Englishmen.
BOTH: A-ha!
Remarkable weather we are having for the time of year.
Do you not think so, Cuthbort?
Indubitably, Basil.
You know, Mr. Potts. . .
Caractacus.
It's a pretty silly name, isn't it?
Oh, I don't think so.
You know,
I really owe you an apology.
You're more than just a father to those two children.
Oh, yes.
Nursemaid, private tutor, chief, cook, and bottle washer.
Everything.
Except what they really need.
Well, it's been quite a day.
Yes, certainly has.
Thank you, (WHISPERING) and say goodbye to the children for me.
Yes, I will.
I hope we'll see you again.
I hope so, too. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
(SINGING) This lovely, lonely man
I've only known a day
I look at him
And cannot look away
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
I've met so many men
So easy to forget
I thought I'd grown immune to them
And yet
He's such a love
He's such a lovely, lonely man
How did he touch my heart?
How did this feeling start?
This glow that feels so warm inside
This sudden summer storm inside
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see
That I need him as much as he needs me
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see
That I need him as much as he needs me
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
Oh, how I love this one and only man
Quickly! Quickly!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Hurry! They're coming!
Quickly! Quickly!
Come on. Hurry.
Come on! Come on!
They're coming!
Get ready.
Get ready. Fire!
Stop, stop, stop!
This way.
No! Stop! Stop, stop.
They're trying to get past, Daddy.
Fine.
Go on.
Get over, you half-wit.
It's Father. And he's in one of his tempers.
Oh, that'll be a change.
You'd better let him pass.
I can't.
There isn't room.
Get out of the way.
Move over, you idiot!
Turn off here.
What do you think you're doing?
We've got him!
Drive away from here.
Whoa!
LORD SCRUMPTIOUS:
You nincompoops!
I'll have you sent away for the rest of your natural lives.
I suppose you blue-faced baboons have some explanation for this outrage.
You stupid fool!
Why? What have I done?
What have you. . .
Ah, ah!
I have an idea.
Now, remember, we are supposed to be
English gentlemen.
So let us try and behave like
English gentlemen.
So open the door!
Caracatacacus Potts.
Inventor.
Typical English eccentric.
That must be the inventor.
Hmm.
Pardon me for protruding, but have I the pleasure of addressing Herr...
(CLEARS THROAT) Mr. Potts?
Yes, that's me.
What do you want?
You selling something?
I don't want nothing.
Excuse me.
I'm off to Africa.
Africa. (CHUCKLES)
That was a ruse to put us off the scent.
I know where he has gone.
Where? Where?
He has gone into his laboratory.
Quick! The portable wireless transmitter!
(MAN SPEAKING GERMAN
ON TRANSMlTTER)
This is X speaking.
Schrecks?
No. X.
Lecks?

No, Sherman! That way!

Lower the ladder.
Get up the ladder!
Quickly. Get up.
Ow!
Quickly! Up!
Take it up! Up. Up.
Now over here! Up. Up.
Wait for me!
God!
Hello!
What's your game, then?
What's going on?
Oi, I'm flying!
Look!
JEREMY: What's that?
JEMlMA: It's a big balloon.
JEREMY: It's a zeppelin.
What's that underneath?
That's. . .
That's Grandpa's hut.
But what's it doing up there?
Well, I don't know.
Help me! Caractacus, my boy.
I'm being kidnapped!
Grandpa, what do you think you're doing?
You come down here!
Caractacus! My boy, it's me, your own father!
Caractacus!
They're not getting away with that.
Grandpa!
Hold tight, back there.
Sit down, Jeremy.
Quickly, Daddy, quickly!
Hurry, Daddy.
Caractacus!
Grandpa!
CARACTACUS: Hold on, Grandpa!
We're coming!
Help!
JEMlMA: Come back, Grandpa!
Hey, Grandpa, come back.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm being abducted by foreigners! Caractacus!
Hey!
Grandpa!
Faster, Daddy, faster.
Where do they think they're going?
(GASPS) Look out!
JEMlMA: Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
(CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG
PLAYING)
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Where do they think they're going?
(GASPS) Look out!
JEMlMA: Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy!
What's happening?
Look.
Look at that.
It's fantastic.
Oh!
You're a genius.
It's nothing, really.
Look! There they are!
JEREMY: Come on, Daddy, after them.
Right, we'll catch them up.
Oh!
Oh, we've lost them.
We'll find them, all right.
But what about Grandpa?
Don't worry about Grandpa.
Grandpa can take care of himself.
(SINGING) This is livin', this is style
This is elegance by the mile

Well, you can't oblige them all
Oh, the posh, posh traveling life

We're still losing height?
There must be something else we can throw out.
But there's nothing else we can throw out.
There's nothing else we. . .
No, no, no! No, no, no!
You just dropped someone!
I can't swim!
Come back. Come back!
Come back! Come back!

What do we do now?
Start swimming!
I don't swim.
Then start drowning!

Hello.
Where are we?
Somewhere over the North Sea, I think.
Don't you know where we're going?
No, I don't, but Chitty does.
I think we're in pretty good hands.
BARON: Good morning.
This is your
Captain speaking.
We hope you had a pleasant trip.
In a few moments we will be landing in Vulgaria.
Where?
Vulgaria.
Oh.
So, please, fasten your seat belts.
And no smoking.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Speed, four and a half knots, sir.
Wind, east-southeast, sir.
Brigade, attention!
Present arms!
We have a guest.
Welcome him.
Jawohl, your Excellency.
Order arms!
Ah, Professor Potts.
Please, to walk this way.
Present arms!
On behalf of
Her Majesty The Queen,
I'd like. . .
Oi! (WHISTLES)
Excuse me.
You're early!
Oh!
Down the table and in the pocket.
Cheat, cheat, cheat.
Ah, Professor Potts!
Professor?
Vulgaria welcomes the brilliant
Professor Potts, inventor extraordinaire.
Excuse me, sir.
There seems to be some sort of mistake.
What?
You are not Professor Potts, the inventor?
Well, l. . .
Executioner!
ALL: Executioner!
What would you like me to invent, sir?
I will show you. My horse!
MAN: Get the horse for his Excellency.
Giddy-up.
How proud you look on that fine horse.
The most beautiful toy you ever bought me, my darling.
But who is this?
This is Professor Potts from England.
How do you do, madam?
And I think we have a surprise for you.
Herr Professor, come on.
(BIDDING FAREWELL
IN FRENCH)
Well, what do you think, professor?
Everything you need.
And these will be your assistants.
And here, this is the Baronial car.
Can you make this car float?
Float?
Like amphibial
English moty car, float over the cresty wave of the water.
Yes, sir, but you see, it's not that easy without my laboratory.
Oh, I have already thought of that.
Here is your lavatory.
If you succeed in making the car float,
I will make you privy councilor.
But if you fail,
I will stuff your head with sauerkraut and feed you to the dogs!
Feedy dorribles, snarly (SNORTS) horribold.
You have got 24 hours!
Twenty-four hours and worky nosy grindstone.
Proper card he is.
Odd sense of humor.
Stuff me head with sauerkraut.
The Baron never makes jokes.
Look at us.
We've been here for years and years.
I came here to repair the telephone.
That was 24 years ago.
They have terrible tortures.
The thumbscrew and rack.
They stretch you and stretch you!
When I first came here,
I was a midget.
Come on.
Me? Floating car?
Well, that's impossible!
Nothing's impossible.
Now, that's what my son's always saying.
We'll help you, won't we, lads?
Nil desperandum.
We'll succeed. You'll see.
Courage, man, courage.
(SINGING) Every bursted bubble has a glory
Each abysmal failure makes a point
Every glowing path that goes astray
Shows you how to find a better way
So every time you stumble, never grumble
Next time you'll bumble even less
For up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Oh, yes!
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Yes. I know, but he wants it to float.
It will!
For every big mistake you make
Be grateful
Hear, hear!
That mistake you'll never make again
No, sir
Every shiny dream that fades and dies
Generates the steam for two more tries
There's magic in the wake of a fiasco
Correct!
It gives you that chance to second guess
Oh, yes!
Then up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Disaster didn't stymie Louis Pasteur
No, sir
Edison took years to see the light
Right
Alexander Graham knew failure well
He took a lot of knocks to ring that bell
So when it gets distressing, it's a blessing
Onward and upward you must press
Yes, yes
Till up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Grow the roses of success
Grow the roses
Those rosy roses
From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success
Start the engine!
Success!
Batten the hatches!
Success!
Man the shrouds!
Lift the anchor!
Success!
Oh, Daddy, we'll never find him.
We must keep looking.
Look, look!
What's that down there?
CARACTACUS: A-ha!
Let's have a look.
Look!
The zeppelin.
JEREMY: We've found Grandpa!
CARACTACUS: No, not yet, we haven't.
BARON: What's that?
No, no, no.
What's happening?
MAN: Remarkable.
Your Excellency!
Your Excellency!
We're being attacked!
Attacked?
Attacked!
That was that terrible Bomburst.
It certainly was.
Where are they going?
Where did they go?
Look, it's a car!
Look, that car's flying!
Floating in the heavenly abode, four peoplebodes.
There they are!
Fire!
What's the matter with you?
Do you want to destroy my beautiful car?
They're firing at us.
Children.
There are children up there.
Children!
We'd better get away from here.
Now, hang on, everybody.
We're coming in to land.
Your Excellency, it's landing in the village.
In the village.
Call out the guards!
Everybody, charge!
And call out the child catcher.
Charge.
Charge! Charge!
Oh.
Let me in!
JEMlMA: Hooray!
We've landed! Hooray!
We've landed!
Hooray! Hooray!
Isn't Chitty wonderful?
Aren't you clever, Daddy?
Yes, he certainly is.
All right. You all stay here.
I'm going up to that castle.
We want to come, too.
We want to help you find Grandpa.
Don't you think we ought to stay together?
Maybe you're right.
All right, come along.
Come on, children.
TRULY: I wonder where we are.
CARACTACUS:
I don't know.
Come on.
Pardon me, sir.
The castle?
What's the matter with him?
Come on.
What are they staring at?
I don't know.
It seems to be the children.
What's the matter with them?
Haven't they seen children before?
Haven't you noticed?
There aren't any children.
Not one.
What's going on?
What's happening?
What's. . .
Hey, you. What's happening?
What's going on?
What is it?
Soldiers! Soldiers!
Hey, you there.
Get those children in here.
Would you mind telling me what's happening?
Quickly, before the soldiers get here.
Soldiers?
Come, Fräulein.
Quickly, quickly.
Get inside.
Just a minute.
Would somebody mind telling me what's going on?
Please don't talk.
We must get those children out of sight.
Jeremy!
If the soldiers find them, they will take them away.
But why? What for?
It's the law.
Nobody's allowed to have children in Vulgaria.
Not allowed?
What about these toys?
The Baroness, she hates children.
Who could hate children?
Quickly, down there!
Whatever you do, don't make a sound.
I want every house in this square to be searched from top to bottom!
Jawohl, Captain!
The first section, step out over there and search!
The second section, over there and search.
Quick!
Section three, over there.
Quick! Search!
Search everywhere!
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
There are children here somewhere.
I can smell them.
A-ha!
Captain,
I think we've got them.
Lieutenant.
You two men, break down this door.
Quick! Quick!
Yes, sir!
Get this door open.
Quickly!
All right! I'm coming!
I'm coming!
Open the door!
Break the door down!
Quickly!
You have no right to come into here.
You've no right.
Search the place!
Search! Search!
A-ha!
They are here somewhere.
I can feel it in my bones.
There are children here somewhere.
Children?
In the toy shop?
Such a notion.
I mean. . .
What do you think you're you doing?
That's something special for the Baron's birthday.
Let me tell you, toymaker.
This nose of mine has never failed me, and if there are children here, my friend, you will die.
A-ha!
Quick! Open it up!
Get down there and search the cellar!
The Baroness will have your teeth for a necklace and your eyeballs for earrings.
Nobody down here, sir.
Fool! ldiot!
Out of my way!
You have to know where to look.
Like cockroaches, they get under the floors, in the cracks in the walls, in the woodwork.
I don't trust a man who makes toys in a land where children are forbidden.
Every toy I make is exclusively for his
Excellency, the Baron.
SOLDlER: Captain, Captain, the flying car!
We've captured the flying car!
CAPTAlN: Come on!
Let's go!
Uh-huh!
Take this car to the castle!
They can't take
Chitty, Daddy.
Daddy, do something.
They can't take
Chitty away.
What are you going to do?
Well, I don't know, but I'm not just gonna stand here.
Are you mad?
Are you going to take on the whole Vulgarian Army single-handed?
What kind of a country is this?
No children!
Everybody terrified out of their lives.
My friend, take some good advice.
Take your children and your good lady and get out of Vulgaria.
And leave Grandpa up in the castle?
Oh, no.
We came to get him out, that's what we're gonna do.
Just tell me how to get there.
Look, I'm only a toymaker.
And if I don't finish this in time for the Baron's birthday tomorrow,
I shall be a dead toymaker.
All right. I'll go myself.
Truly, you stay here with the children.
All right. All right.
You don't know what you're letting yourself in for, believe me.
Here's one for you, one for you.
Thank you.
Thank you, toymaker.
Keep them out of sight, please!
You be good children.
And you do what
Truly tells you.
Yes, Daddy.
We will.
TOYMAKER:
Well, are you coming?
(SOFTLY) Come.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
There isn't a scrap of food in the place.
I'm so hungry, my tummy hurts.
Mine's making funny noises.
I simply must find something for you.
Now, if you promise me not to move from here until I come back. . .
We promise, don't we, Jemima?
Yes.
Now, you remember, you stay right here.
To get in that way, you would have to be a mouse or a magician.
We should go down now before a sentry sees us.
Come. Come.
Ah, the flying car!
At last it's mine!
Send for the inventor!
Then, fly!
Fly.
Yes, fly.
Come on, fly.
Fly, fly, fly. Oh.
I command you to fly!
Bring him over here.
Over here.
Hello.
What's this doing here?
You're the inventor.
Make this car fly.
Make it fly. Go get in.
Stand back, everyone!
We are going to fly.
Stand back.
Yoo-hoo, Bombie!
Wait for me!
No, every time I want to have a little fun, she turns up.
There you are. Get in.
My darling, we're going for a fly.
How exciting.
Fly. How thrilling.
Very well. Come on.
Hurry up.
Yes, yes,
I'm doing my best, sir.
Now just a minute.
Here's one that we haven't tried yet.
Here we go, my beloved.
Hold on!
Isn't it exciting, my dear?
Oh!
You're a genius.
My guns! Bring my guns!
Don't worry.
I'll get you down.
I've been waiting for this for 20 years.
Hold on, my love.
Are you still there, my love?
Don't move.
There she is,
Your Excellency.
Oh! Oh! My God.
My diamonds.
Are you all right, my dear?
I'm all right, my dumpling.
Good.
Never mind.
I'll get her the next time.
Here we are, children.
Come and get your lollipops.
Lollipops.
Come along, my little ones.
Lollipops.
Ice cream, chocolate, all free today.
Listen.
Come along, children.
Lollipops.
What's that?
Children, where are you?
I know you're here somewhere.
I've lots of lovely goodies for you.
Jeremy, you mustn't.
Lollipops.
And all free today.
Cherry pies. Cream puffs. lce cream. Treacle tarts.
Treacle tarts!
And ice creams.
And all free!
Come along, kiddie-winkies.
Come on!
But, Jeremy,
Truly said we mustn't. . .
We'll get Truly some as well. Come on.
Mr. Man!
Hey! Wait!
Children!
Come back here!
Wait! Wait!
Come along, my little dears, my little mice. Come to me.
What will it be? lce cream?
Yes, ice cream!
Strawberry, chocolate, vanilla?
Strawberry! Chocolate!
It's all inside.
Yes, strawberry!
Come along, my little dears.
Goodie! Come on. Yes!
Come inside.
Not a penny to pay.
Yes, come on.
Get in.
Go inside, my little dears!
No. Help, help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Children! Children!
CARACTACUS: Truly!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
What is it?
What's happened?
The children!
He took the children!
Your Excellency!
Let us out!
Let us out!
Silence!
Children,
Your Highness.
Foreign children.
Unique specimens.
You're sure they can't get out?
No, Your Highness.
Perhaps Your Highness would care to examine them.
Nasty little creatures.
Very, very treacherous.
Foreign.
Just you wait till our daddy hears about this.
He'll come and blow up the whole castle!
Take them away to the tower.
To the tower!
Nasty, horrid, mean old lady.
And very ugly.
Oh, she's going!
She's going!
Two hundred feet above us through that solid rock is the castle of
Baron Bomburst.
These are our children.
For 12 years, we have hidden them here.
Look at them.
They don't know what a tree looks like or what it is to run or to laugh in the sunshine.
Do you, eh?
Food!
Get the food here.
Come on!
There's bread for everyone.
Look at them.
Like little rats, they run up and down the sewers, stealing food from the kitchens.
. . .potatoes.
Here, catch!
Son! Son!
I'm looking for my children.
I think they're up there in the castle with their grandfather.
Have you seen anything of them?
No, sir.
A little boy and girl?
Yes.
They're locked up in the tower.
And the grandfather?
He's in the dungeon under the castle.
Sir, have you come to help us?
Are you going to take us out of here?
What's your name, son?
Peter, sir.
Well, Peter, you shouldn't be afraid, even in a terrible place like this, because there's always hope.
That's what I always tell my children when they're afraid.
(SINGING) A gentle breeze from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows o'er Lullaby Bay
It fills the sails of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail
So close your eyes on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye to cares of the day
And watch your boat from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away from Lullaby Bay
Is that the only advice you have to offer, my friend? Hmm?
It's a beautiful dream,
Caractacus, but I don't see how it's gonna help them.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna get up into that castle.
It is impossible!
Well, we'll see.
Now, everybody listen to me.
You want to get out of here, don't you?
ALL: Yes! Yes!
Tomorrow is
Baron Bomburst's birthday, yes?
Well, we're gonna give him a birthday party he'll never forget.
I want everybody to gather around here.
I have an idea.
Yes, come in closer.
All right, quiet!
(SINGING) Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday, dear Bombie...
Don't move. What a picture!
Such memories it brings back.
My little dumpling!
(SINGING) You're my little chu-chi face
My coot-chi, coot-chi woot-chi little chu-chi face
Every time I look at you
I sigh
And you're my little teddy bear
My lovey lovey dovey little teddy bear
Yoo-hoo!
You're the Apfelstrudel of mein eye
Your chu-chi woot-chi nose
Your chu-chi woot-chi eyes
They set my heart aflutter
Your oot-chi, coot-chi ways
Your oot-chi, coot-chi gaze
Wilts me down like melting butter
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Whatever you may ask becomes my happy task
I only live to serve you
I never will divine what magic made you mine
I only know
I don't deserve you
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi
Chu-chi
Woot-chi
Oot-chi
Coot-chi
Chu-chi, woot-chi, oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Oh, what a rotten birthday party.
Never mind, my little Bombie.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprises?
Oh, I love surprises!
Sit down quickly.
Summon the toymaker!
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!
Don't waste time!
Your Excellency, may I be permitted to wish you all you wish yourself on this happy occasion.
Never mind all that.
What have you made me for my birthday?
What have I made you?
Such a toy!
Such a work of mechanical perfection.
Well, well, well, where is it?
Bring it in!
Right away.
I'll just get it for you.
Bring in the Baron's birthday present!
TOYMAKER: Here, here, here.
This year, Your Excellency,
I have surpassed even myself.
Put it down there.
Careful! Careful with it!
For months,
I have been working night und day perfecting every little detail to bring you this!
Dolls? Dolls?
I have hundreds of dolls!
(CRYING) No dolls.
But this is not just an ordinary doll,
Your Excellency.
You see?
(SINGING) What do you see?
You people gazing at me
You see a doll on a music box
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
You cannot see
How much I long to be free
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
While
I'm
Turning around and around
(SINGING) What do you see?
Truly Scrumptious
You people gazing at me
You're truly, truly scrumptious
You see a doll on a music box
Scrumptious...
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for love's first kiss
Honest, Truly
You're the answer to my wishes
You cannot see
Truly Scrumptious
How much
I long to be free
Though I may seem presumptuous
Turning around on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
My heart beats so unruly
Yearning
Because I love you truly
While I'm
Honest, Truly
I do
Turning around and around
Just a minute!
Oh, I'm so happy,
I could jump for joy!
Come on!
Follow me.
Children! No! No!
BARON: No! No!
No!
Let me down!
Call out the cavalry!
Let me down!
TRULY: Jeremy!
CARACTACUS: Jemima!
TRULY: Jeremy!
They could be anywhere.
You look down that way.
I'll go this way.
Jeremy! Jemima!
Jeremy and Jemima!
Jeremy! Jemima!
It's Truly!
Truly! We're in here!
Don't worry.
We'll get you out of here in a minute.
Here! Here, quick.
Quick, they're in there.
Children, are you all right?
CHlLDREN: Get us out of here!
We found them.
They're in there. Come on.
Help me break the door down.
Children, get away from the door.
Children!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Let me down!
Ow!
My Liebchen, are you hurt?
My back is broken.
We must escape through the cellars.
Very well. Come on.
Come on!
Daddy, look at the children.
You stay here.
JEMIMA: Daddy!
What are you doing?
Where are all these children coming from?
I thought we had passed a law against children.
Quick. This way.
Where are we going?
Quickly. We'll go down here.
(GASPS) No, no.
I'll get my clothes dirty.
Don't argue.
Oh, my crown.
I lost my crown.
Oh, never mind, my little pumpkin.
Here.
Attack!
No! Daddy!
Look! There's Chitty!
Chitty's come to save us!
Hooray!
Hello, a motorcar.
What's that doing here?
There's Grandpa.
Grandpa!
Caractacus! My boy!
Are you all right?
Oh!
Stand back from the propellers.
Keep clear.
Bye!
Bye! Bye!
Bye! Bye!
CARACTACUS: And so, after that, Vulgaria became a free country, and all the children laughed and played in the sunshine, and they were very, very happy.
And Chitty flew high over the mountains back to England, everybody safe and sound.
And Daddy and Truly were married.
And lived happily ever after.
Yes.
Is that how the story ends?
It's getting late.
We better get back.
Well. . .
Goodbye, Jeremy.
Goodbye, Jemima.
Goodbye, Truly.
Will we see you again?
Oh, I expect so.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Truly.
I'm sorry about the children.
I hope they didn't embarrass you.
In what way?
Why, that silly joke about us getting married.
Well, you know what kids are like.
Yes, I understand.
I mean, I don't think they realize how ridiculous that would be.
Ridiculous?
Well, yes.
You live in that big house, your father, the factory and all.
It's a different world, Truly.
You know, if I said something like that, you'd call me a snob.
I didn't mean. . .
Goodbye.
Well, don't you want to ride up front?
Well, that was a fine picnic, wasn't it?
Shall we have another one tomorrow?
With Truly?
Yes.
Well, Miss Scrumptious has a lot of social engagements, you know.
Are we ever going to see Truly again, Daddy?
Well, we'll see.
JEREMY: Look, that's Lord Scrumptious' car.
CARACTACUS:
Why, I believe it is.
JEMIMA: I wonder what it's doing here.
CARACTACUS:
Well, I don't know.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Good afternoon.
Are you. . .
Boom! Boom! Boom!
That's wiped out your dashed cavalry.
Yes, sir.
But I have my 2nd
Infantry battalion attacking here from the rear.
Attacking from the rear?
That's dashed unethical.
Artillery, prepare to open fire.
Fire!
GRANDPA: Number one battalion, prepare to advance!
What's going on here?
There you are, young Potts.
Been waiting for you.
And that wiped out your artillery!
You're a cad, Potts.
Would someone mind telling me what's going on?
Fancy you being old Bungie's son.
Bungie?
Bungie Potts, best batman I ever had.
Weren't you, Potts?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
You mean that you were. . .
My boy.
Allow me to introduce to you my Brigadier.
Your Brigadier?
Potts. . .
How about some more tea?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
As for you, young man, there's a very good chance you may be very rich.
CARACTACUS: Very rich?
What do you mean?
Those confounded sweets of yours.
Useless for humans, wonderful for dogs.
Woof Sweets, that's what we'll call them.
Woof Sweets?
Canine candies.
Dogs love them.
Make a fortune.
Daddy, Daddy!
You've done it, Daddy.
You've done it!
Have l?
It's the posh life for us all now, my boy.
We're all going to be rich!
Hooray!
Do you mean to tell me
I invented something that actually works?
Of course they do.
Wouldn't be offering you a contract unless they did.
Sign here, please.
Wait. Don't go away.
I'll be right back.
LORD SCRUMPTlOUS:
What about the contract?
But, Daddy, where are you going?
Daddy!
What's the matter with the fellow?
Well, he's a bit of an eccentric, sir, a genius, of course, but definitely an eccentric.
Can't imagine where he gets it from.
Truly, you'll never believe it.
I just got home. . .
This is beginning to be. . .
. . .and your father was at my house.
. . .a hazard.
I know! I know!
They told me at the house.
We're rich.
You know, more than that,
I have succeeded.
I always knew you would.
You know something else?
The kids were right.
There's nothing so ridiculous about the idea of getting married.
Well, whoever said there was?
Well, Mr. Potts.
What's the matter?
Now you'll have to marry me.
So dreams can come true.
Yes, they can.
Yes, they can, but you have to be practical, too.
You have to face the facts.
Man has to see things as they really are.
After all, a man with responsibilities can't walk around with his head in the clouds all the time.
A man should keep his feet solidly on the ground.
Oh, a man should have his dreams but a man has to learn to put those dreams to some practical use, not just sit around and think about them all the time.
BOTH: (SINGING) Oh, you, pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, we love you

On Chitty Chitty we depend

To use the vernacular
It's wizard
It's smashing
BOTH: It's keen
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty

Hi!
Hey, wait for me.
I can't hardly move with all these creeper things.
Them other kids must have got scattered in the dark.
We ought to go and find them.
My auntie told me not to run on account of my asthma.
- Asthma?
- That's right.
I was the only boy in our school that had asthma.
And I've been wearing specs since I was three.
- Where's the plane?
- The storm must have dragged it out to sea.
There must have been some kids still in it.
Are there any grown-ups?
- I don't think so.
- What's your name?
Ralph.
I don't care what they call me... as long as they don't call me what they did at school.
What's that?
- They used to call me "Piggy."
- Piggy!
As long as you don't tell the others.
Daddy's a commander in the navy.
One day, when he gets leave, he'll come and rescue us.
- Aren't you coming in?
- Oh, it's hot.
No. My auntie wouldn't let me- account of my asthma.
Sucks to your asthma!
You can't half swim well.
- Hey, look.
- It's a shell.
I've seen one like it before on someone's back wall.
A conch, he called it. He used to blow it, and then his mum would come.
He blew from down here.
You've done it!
Hey! Is anyone there?
Hey! Hey!
I think we ought to go and explore a bit.
- What's your name?
- Percival Williams Madison... the Vicarage, Hartcourt, St. Anthony.
Telephone: Hartcourt 241.
- And what's your name?
- George.
- What's your name?
- Sam and Eric.
Sam and Eric.

Choir, halt!
Where's the man with the trumpet?
There's no man with a trumpet.
Only me.
- Isn't there a man here?
- No.
Then we'll have to look after ourselves.
We're having a meeting.
Come and join us.
Is he all right?
Take him out of the sun.
Put him in the shade, quick!
- All right. Let him alone.
- But, Merridew-
He'll be all right.
Simon's always throwing a faint.
Now let's decide what we're going to do.
That's why Ralph made a meeting- so as we can decide what to do.
We got most names.
Those two- they're twins.
Sam and Eric.
- I'm Sam.
- I'm Eric.
I'm Ralph.
- And you?
- Douglas.
Robin.
- Yours?
- Charles.
And what are all your names?
Henry.
Maurice.
Robert.
Rupert.
Harold.
Bill.
Roger.
- Simon.
- I'm Jack.
- And that boy there. He-
- You're talking too much.
- Shut up, Fatty!
- His name's not Fatty.
- His real name's Piggy.
- Piggy!
We've got to decide about being rescued.
I think we ought to have a chief to decide things.
Yeah, someone must take charge.
- I ought to be chief.
- Him with the shell!
- He got us together.
- I'm chief chorister and head boy.
Let's have a vote.
All right. We'll have a vote.
Who wants Jack for chief then?
- Who wants me?
- Me!
- Me!
- Me!
Me. Me.
I'm chief then.
Jack's in charge of the choir.
What do you want them to be?
Hunters.
Choir, take off your togs.
Hey, what are you wearing those funny clothes for?
It's our uniform.
Listen, everybody.
If this isn't an island... we might get rescued straightaway.
So we've got to decide if it is.
Three of us will go on an expedition to find out.
I'll go... and Jack.
- And-
- Take me. Please.
You. You all right now?
- I'll come.
- We don't want you. Three's enough.
I was with him when he found the conch.
I was with him before anyone else was.
- You can't come.
- You told them after what I said- after I said I didn't want-
What on earth are you talking about?
About being called Piggy.
I said I didn't care as long as they didn't call me Piggy.
And I said not to tell.
And then you went and said straight out-
Better Piggy than Fatty.
And anyway, I'm sorry if you feel like that.
Go back, Piggy, and take names.
That's your job. So long.
Hey, look!
One, two, three.
Heave!
Heave!
We're on an uninhabited island.
We shall have to look after ourselves.
But it's a good island.
There's lots of fruit, water... and I'm pretty sure there aren't any dangerous animals.
So things aren't so bad.
None of us are hurt.
There isn't any danger... and we can build shelters and be comfortable.
So if we're sensible, if we do things properly... if we don't lose our head, we'll be all right.
- But where will we sleep?
- We'll build shelters.
We can have smashing fun.
And another thing.
We can't have everybody talking at once.
We shall have to put our hands up, like we do at school.
Then I'll give him the conch.
I agree with Ralph.
We've got to have rules and obey them.
After all, we're not savages.
We're English.
And the English are best at everything.
So we'll have lots of rules, and when anybody breaks them-
- Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!
- Quiet!
You're not letting Ralph get to the most important thing.
Who knows we're here?
Nobody knows we're here.
Perhaps they knew where we were going to... perhaps not.
But they don't know where we are now
'cause we never got there.
We might stay here till we die.
He wants to know what you're going to do about the snake thing.
Tell us about the snake thing.
Now he says it was a beastie.
Beastie?
- A snake thing, ever so big. He saw it.
- When?
When he was hiding in the jungle in the dark.
He says when the rain stopped... it turned into one of them things like ropes in the trees... and hung in the branches.
He says, "Will it come back tonight?"
But there isn't a beastie.
I tell you, there isn't a beast.
Ralph's right, of course.
There isn't a snake thing, but if there was, we'd hunt and kill it.
There's another thing.
If a ship comes near the island, they may not notice us.
So we must make smoke on top of the mountain.
We must make a fire.
Come on! Follow me!
- Yes!
- Let's go now!
Just like kids- like a crowd of kids.
I bet it's gone teatime.
Anybody got any matches?
My, what a big heap you've made!
Piggy's specs! Come on!
Get out of the light!
Roger. Hey, Roger.
Come on over here.
My specs!
Ralph, I'll split up my choir- my hunters, that is- and we'll be responsible for keeping the fire going.
We'll make a big blaze now.
It'll last all night.
Come and give us a hand, will you?
Attention!
Here comes one.
This is a nice one.
Just a minute. Be careful.
Go!
No!
- You're gonna hit me, huh?
- No, this isn't gonna hit you!
Come on, come on! Come on!
Kill! Kill! Kill!
No throwing sand!
Ralph, come here! It's a plane!
A plane! A plane!
Can't you hear it? Ralph, it's going!
Hurry up! Ralph!
I can't see no smoke.
Where is it?
Smoke.
Piggy's glasses!
If the fire's out, we'll need them!
Stop! Come back! Come back!
Come back! Come back!
They've let the bloody fire out!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Hey, Ralph!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!
Look. We killed a pig!
We stole up on it. We got in a circle-
You let the fire out.
We can light it up again.
You should have been with us, Ralph.
There was lots of blood.
You should have seen it.
There was a plane. There was a plane!
They might have seen us.
We might have gone home!
You and your blood, Jack Merridew!
You and your hunting!
We might have gone home!
We needed meat.
You didn't ought to have let the fire go out!
My specs!
Here. Here they are.
Just you wait!
That was a dirty trick.
All right, all right. I'm sorry!
About the fire, I mean.
There.
I apologize.
Light the fire then.
Choir!
- Piggy.
- No, Ralph, don't! Please!
I'll bring them back.
- Will it swell up his legs?
- Give me a nice piece!
Give me a leg, will ya?
- Give it to me.
- Give me a piece, please.
Aren't I havin' none?
You didn't hunt.
No more did Ralph.
No more did Simon.
Eat, damn you!
Kill the pig!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Quiet!
Get down on the beach.
I'm calling an assembly.
Things are beginning to break up.
I don't know why.
It all began well.
Then people started forgetting what really matters.
The most important thing for all of us... is getting rescued.
So now let's discuss who does what, and when we have decided... we can start again... and be careful about things like the fire.
All right, so the fire went out.
But we're hunters. We got you meat.
And if there is a beast... it's my hunters who will protect you from it.
What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name?
Quiet! Quiet!
What's your name?
Percival Williams Madison, the Vicarage...
Hartcourt, St. Anthony.
Telephone-
Telephone-
Tele-
Ready?
What did he say?
He says there's a beast.
It comes out of the sea.
My daddy said they haven't found all the animals in the sea.
My daddy says there are animals-
What do you call them?
They make ink and are hundreds of feet long... and eat whales whole.
A squid can't come out of the water.
Maybe he means it's some sort of ghost.
Maybe that's what the beast is- a ghost.
I don't believe in no ghosts. Ever.
Who cares what you believe, Fatty?
Maybe there is a beast.
Hear him. He's got the conch.
What I mean is... maybe it's only us.
Nuts!
We should have left all this till daylight.
We're tired.
We'll have a vote- on ghosts, I mean- and then go back to the shelters.
Who thinks there may be ghosts?
- I see.
- I didn't vote for no ghosts.
Remember that, all of you.
- You shut up, you fat slug!
- I got the conch!
Oh, Jack, let him speak.
He's got the conch.
And you shut up. Who are you anyway, just sitting there, telling people what to do?
- You can't hunt. You can't sing.
- I'm chief. I was chosen.
Why should choosing make any difference, telling people what to do?
Piggy's got the conch.
That's right. Favor
Piggy as you always do.
- Jack!
- "Jack!" "Jack!"
- The rules. You're breaking the rules!
- Who cares?
Because the rules are the only thing we've got.
Bollocks to the rules!
We're strong. We hunt.
If there's a beast, we'll hunt it down and beat and beat!
What's grown-ups going to say?
Look at 'em!
I think I ought to give up being chief.
You can't, Ralph. Not now.
Blow the conch.
You've got to be tough.
Make them do what you want.
If I blow the conch... and they don't come back... then we've had it.
Are there ghosts, Piggy? Or beasts?
Of course there aren't.
- Why not?
- Because things wouldn't make sense.
Houses and streets... and TV.
They wouldn't work.
But suppose they wouldn't make sense, not here on this island.
Supposing things are watching us... and waiting.
Go on being chief, Ralph.
- Who's there?
- Me, Simon.
I wish my auntie were here.
Oh, what's the use?
Grown-ups know things.
They ain't afraid of the dark.
They'd meet and have tea and discuss.
Then things would be all right.
- Sam.
- What's the matter?
- It was furry.
- There was something moving... behind his head- wings.
It sort of sat up.
It had eyes... teeth, claws.
We ran as fast as we could, bashed into things.
The beast followed us.
Nearly caught me.
You're not pulling our legs, are you?
- We'll hunt it. Who'll come?
- Me! Me!
But those sticks- they're made of wood.
Don't be so silly.
- Frightened?
- Of course I am. Who wouldn't be?
- Come on. Let's go.
- Who'll mind the little ones?
- Piggy will look after them.
- That's right. Keep Piggy out of danger.
Haven't you got any sense?
How can Piggy help with only one eye?
Jack, is there anywhere on this island where we haven't been?
There's only- Of course!
The tail end part, where the rocks pile up.
I'm chief. I'll go on alone.
The rest of you wait here and hide.
Do you think-
I've been all over. It must be here.
I... don't believe in the beast.
I suppose not.
Couldn't let you do it on your own.
What a place for a fort!
The beast isn't here.
Let's get the others and go on to the top.
Now, this story is about the place where I live... called Camberley.
Now, Camberley is quite an old place... but it hasn't been called Camberley all the time.
It used to be called Cambridgetown.
And they used to get mixed up with the letters... between Cambridge or Cambridgetown.
So letters that were to a person in Cambridgetown... used to go to a person in Cambridge.
So they got a bit mixed up.
So they thought they'd change the name at the post office... because it was the post office that had all the trouble of sorting the letters.
And they thought they'd leave the "cam" from Cambridgetown... and they- and "ber" is a river... and there are a lot of rivers round there.
"Camber." And then "ley," because a lot of the towns near there ended with "ley."
Their names ended with "ley."
So they called it Cam-ber-ley. Camberley.
And that's the true story of Camberley.
I don't think we should leave Piggy with the little uns. Not all night.
We mustn't let anything happen to Piggy, must we?
I think someone should go back and tell them we won't be back till after dark.
I'll go. I don't mind.
Honestly.
We'll go to the beach.
We can go to the top tomorrow.
If you're frightened, of course.
All right then. Who wants to go now?
You see?
I'm going to climb the mountain to look for the beast- now.
- Coming?
- I don't mind.
If you don't mind, of course.
Not at all!
I think it's silly only two of us go.
If we meet anything on the other side, two won't be enough.
All right. Come along, Roger.
If you don't want to go on,
I'll go myself.
Go on then. We'll wait here.
Shut up.
I saw a thing on top.
There was a noise too. Kind of "plop."
Keep close to the ground.
Over there, gap in the rock.
First, you know now we've seen the beast.
We crawled up.
We were only a few feet away.
The beast sat up and looked at us.
I don't think we could fight a thing that size.
Honestly, you know.
We're talk, but we couldn't fight a tiger.
We'd hide. Even Jack would hide.
- What about my hunters?
- Boys armed with sticks?
All right then.
He's not a hunter.
He'd never have got us meat.
He's just giving orders, expects people to obey for nothing.
He's like Piggy.
He says things like Piggy.
He's not a proper chief.
He's a coward.
On top, when Roger and me went on, he stayed back.
- I went too.
- After.
I went on too, then I went away.
So did you.
Call me a coward then.
All this talk.
- All this talk, talk, talk.
- Right.
I'm not gonna be part of Ralph's lot.
I'm going off by myself to the rocks to hunt and have feasts and have fun.
Anyone who wants can come too.
Jack!
I said we could do without a certain person.
Now I think we've got to decide.
We can do without Jack Merridew.
There's others besides him on this island.
But now we've really got a beast- though I can hardly believe it- we'll need to stay close to the platform.
I've been talking, Ralph.
What?
We've got no fire on the mountain... but what's wrong with a fire down here?
That's a good idea. We can build it right here between the shelters.
I think we ought to climb the mountain.
What's the use?
What else is there to do?
And put some dry leaves on.
Make sure they're dry.
So it'll burn.
If they're wet, it won't burn properly.
Come on.
Come on.
Now!
Right up the ass.
Sharpen a stick at both ends.
This head is for the beast.
It's a gift.
Can't they see?
Don't they understand?
Unless we keep the smoke burning, we'll die.
What's wrong, Piggy?
Why are things going wrong like they are?
I don't know, Ralph.

Looks like we're going to have a lot of rain, all right.
What about the fire?
Hey, come back! That was a mean trick!
We would have given it to you if you asked.
Take 'em some food.
Bananas!
Who'll join my tribe?
Jack. I'll join your tribe, Jack.
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I want to join.
I gave you food, and my hunters will protect you from the beast.
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I will, Jack.
I'm chief. And what about the fire?
And I've got the conch!
You haven't got it with you.
You left it behind.
See? Clever.
Anyway, the conch doesn't count on this end of the island.
The conch counts here and all over the island.
Who'll join my tribe?
- Me, me!
- I will!
- Let's join Jack's tribe!
- Yeah!
Come away. There's going to be trouble.
Kill... the... beast!

Piggy, are you the only one left?
There are some little uns.
They don't count. No big uns?
Oh, Sam and Eric.
They're collecting wood.
- Nobody else?
- Not that I know of.
Piggy.
Piggy.
That was murder.
You stop it!
What good are you doing talking like that?
It was dark!
There was that bloody dance!
There was thunder and lightning and rain!
We were scared!
It wasn't... what you said.
Oh, Piggy!
It was an accident.
He was batty.
He asked for it. It was an accident.
Oh, God, I want to go home.
Take him away!
Tomorrow, I'll hunt again.
Then we'll leave another head for the beast.
Some of you will stay and defend the gate.
The beast may try and come in.
Remember how he crawled?
He came disguised.
The beast may try and come... even though we gave him the head of our kill to eat.
So watch and be careful.
But didn't we- Didn't we-
No. How could we kill it?
He told us. The beast was disguised.
Tomorrow, when we get meat, we'll have a feast.
- Chief?
- Yes, Bill?
What'll we use to light the fire?
We'll get fire from the others.
We've got to get out of this.
What do you mean?
Get rescued.
I mean it.
If we don't get out of here soon, we'll be barmy.
- Round the bend.
- Crackers.
Have you written a letter to your auntie lately?
I don't know where she is now... and I haven't got an envelope or a stamp... and there isn't a pillar-box or a postman.
I haven't said anything very funny.
Piggy-y-y-y!
Piggy!
Don't make a sound.
We're going to get you, Piggy.
Piggy?
Where are you, Piggy?
We've come to get you.
Piggy, you've changed!
Piggy!
I just take the conch to say this.
I can't see without my glasses... and I got to get them back.
What are we going to do?
Hey! Who goes there?
Stop being silly!
You can see who I am!
I'm calling an assembly!
Don't leave me, Ralph!
You sit down and wait for me. Here.
What do you want?
Go away, Ralph.
You keep to your end.
This is my end and my tribe.
You have to leave me alone.
You took Piggy's specs.
You've got to give them back.
Got to? Who says?
I say! That was a dirty trick.
We would have given you fire if you asked for it.
But you didn't.
You came sneaking up like a thief.
- Say that again.
- Thief! Thief!
Who's a thief?
You are!
Ralph! Remember what we came for.
The fire. My specs.
Don't you see?
There may be a ship out there or a plane!
- Grab 'em!
- Jack!
Tie 'em up!
See? They do what I want.
You're a beast and a swine and a bloody, bloody thief!
Go, Jack! Go!
Let me speak!
I've got the conch!
Which is it better to be?
A pack of painted savages like you are... or sensible like Ralph is?
Which is better?
To have rules and agree, or to hunt and kill?
Piggy!
Sam and Eric!
Hey, Sam and Eric.
It's me, Ralph.
When they find me, what are they going to do?
Roger sharpened a stick at both ends.
They're going to hurt you tomorrow.
We've got to give signals like this-
Only louder, of course.
You've got to go now, Ralph.
Won't you come with me?
The three of us would have a better chance.
Quick, Ralph!
I'll be in that thicket there.
They won't think to look so close.
- Who is it? Who's there?
- Attention!
- Eric, it's Roger.
- Scouts' report.
Here. Take this.
Attention!
Scouts' report.
Come here.
Got Piggy's specs?
I'll start a fire.
He must be in here somewhere.
You go round that way.
We'll smoke him out.
Something's moved.
Roger, come help.
Got the stick?
I told you. He's dangerous.

That's your man.
- Draw your pay.
- You wanted him broken.
Yeah, but not ruined.
Now, get out of here.
Mr. Marshall.
Ever heard of a J.W. Grant?
He needs you. Urgent.
My husband.
Hurry. Hurry.
Please, hurry.
Get out of here.
Baby!
It's nice to see you.
I'm Joe Grant.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Ehrengard.
Got your telegram, Mr. Grant.
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sharp.
Yeah. Me too, Lizzie.
Mr. Grant, I'm your local bank representative.
As per your instructions, this box contains...
Thank you for coming, Mr. Fardan.
The receipt, Mr. Grant.
Exactly $100,000 in gold coins.
Not a coin larger than $50.
That's quite an unusual request.
Thank you. Move out.
Mr. Grant. Slow freight ahead.
- Sidetrack it.
- You should count the money.
- Didn't you count it?
- Well, yes, of course, but...
Thank you.
Henry "Rico" Fardan. Virginia Military
Academy, Philippine campaign...
...Cuba with Roosevelt's Rough
Riders. Married a Mexican woman.
No children. Wife deceased.
Joined Pancho Villa as weapons expert and tactician.
Your hair was darker then.
My heart was lighter then.
Left Villa's forces, June, 1915.
A year of wildcatting and prospecting.
Results: Negative.
Now demonstrating automatic weapons. Salary: $40 a week.
Hans Ehrengard. Ex-cavalryman, cattle boss, wrangler...
...bull-whacker, packmaster.
Jacob Sharp. Specialist with rifle, rope and longbow.
Most dependable scout and tracker in the territory.
Any objections to working with a Negro?
What's the job, Mr. Grant?
How well do you know him?
- Well enough.
- What's your feeling toward him?
I have the highest respect for him...
...as a soldier.
Last week, your respected soldier kidnapped my wife.
His ransom note.
Your job:
A mission of mercy.
Raza. Captain Jesus Raza.
Jesus.
What a name for the bloodiest cutthroat in Mexico.
Mrs. Grant is a prisoner about 100 miles across this desert.
A hellhole. For Raza, a fortress.
He was born in that desert.
He and his men know every ravine, every rock, every cliff.
It'd take a battalion at least a month.
But a few daring men...
...specialists, led by you...
...could do it in one bold, swift stroke.
Why not? You're fluent in Spanish.
You know the terrain.
You know Raza.
How he thinks and reacts.
- I know you can do it.
- I don't think so, Mr. Grant.
One thousand dollars a man going in.
If you bring her back safe and sound...
...another 9000 dollars for each of you.
- How many men does Raza have?
- Pasqual?
Last month, 150, maybe. Now?
- If I were you, I'd pay the ransom.
- There it is.
One hundred thousand dollars in gold coins, as requested by Raza.
Will that guarantee that she won't be killed? You know Raza.
Say we were lucky enough to get there.
How do we get your wife out? Safely?
Gentlemen, I don't know where else to turn.
- What we really need is an equalizer.
- Name it.
A dynamiter with a delicate touch to blow out a candle...
...without denting the candleholder.
- Who?
Him.
Arrange to have that man at the train where we pick up the horses.
- Where is he?
- Not far.
- Get the details.
- In jail.
- In jail?
- He says that $700 will bail him out.
But is he dependable?
Can he be trusted?
I trust him.
Then you've got him.
- Rico, buddy, I don't deserve you.
- I agree.
I can understand you getting into a crap game and losing $700...
...but how'd you lose your pants?
- In a lady's bedroom.
Trying to raise the cash.
Almost had it made too.
You realise people are the only animals who make love face to face?
He's all yours.
Thanks. Again.
You could have telegraphed the money yesterday.
Yesterday, I didn't have the money.
What's the proposition?
You won't lose your pants.
Your life, maybe, but... what's that?
Hardly anything at all.
- Well?
- Nice animals.
- Picked by Mr. Ortega.
- You can depend on them.
This one is Mrs. Grant's favourite.
Bred for speed.
He'll need a lot more than that for this job.
- You'll have to make them do.
- Mr. Grant...
...I can make them go, but I can't make them do.
$100,000 for a wife?
She must be a lot of woman.
Certain women have a way of changing some boys into men...
...and some men back into boys.
- That's a woman worth saving.
- Where are we going?
- The Painted Mountains.
That's right.
- You want us to go back to Mexico?
- This time strictly for cash.
- What's the deal?
- $10,000 per man, for nine days' work.
More money than we ever realised out of all our schemes put together.
No detours!
I made us a contract. All the way.
- They know who took the woman?
- Raza.
Our Raza? A kidnapper?
- Grant's got a ransom note to prove it.
- Well, I'll be damned.
Most of us are.
Last week Mrs. Grant went riding.
Across the border.
She was born in Mexico.
I suppose she got lonely for it.
By the time we were alarmed, the note of ransom arrived.
You'll want to know how she looks.
Those were taken four years ago on our wedding day.
I guess I'm not much good without her.
Not anymore.
- What part of the hacienda is she kept?
- I'd only be guessing.
We have to know.
- The goat-keeper must know.
- Is he still there?
- What goat-keeper?
- By name, Padillia. Eduardo Padillia.
He was devoted to Mrs. Grant.
Twice a day he brought her goat's milk. It was almost a ritual.
By this, he will know you have my blessing.
Like myself, he would give his life for the señora.
When you cross under that bridge, you're in Mexico.
You'll leave as soon as it's dark.
It's safer to travel by night, rest by day.
Bring her back to me.
Please.
We've been following the same tracks.
- Mexicans.
- How many horses?
Eight. More likely 10.
- How long ago?
- Couple hours.
- Which way they headed?
- Same as us, south. Only, circling.
Now, why should they circle?
Raza's men?
- Why not?
- This far north?
That's a good question.
Could be anybody. Even friendly.
- Could be.
- Jake, shag them. Look them over.
But just look.
We'll camp at Dead Man's Canyon.
Spot us by the Painted Hills.
I'll find you.
Rico. You know something?
Me and Raza are the two most corruptible bums.
- We'd do most anything for money.
- And have.
But not kidnapping.
That's not our trade.
Why did Raza pick Grant's wife to kidnap?
Company. Eight.
Next bend up ahead.
- Last night you saw tracks for 10.
- That's right.
- Any cover?
- Both sides.
Cut out your two horses and the dynamite mule.
- Maybe they're just passing.
- If so, they'll ride in single file.
The leader in front, and they'll palaver.
If it's trouble, they'll come as a group.
If the leader takes his hat off and passes it across to cover his gun...
...let go, fast.
- Bill, you take the point.
- They got bolt-action rifles.
- Same setup as Durango?
- Yeah. Why not?
- They're here.
- They're here.
Good morning, friends.
Good morning.
They're Americans.
- You got lost?
- Just looking for a place to camp.
What you got in those packs, boss?
Gold?
You got more gold in your teeth.
He says I've got more gold in my teeth. How funny!
- It's very dangerous around here.
- Oh, that so?
Sure. Many bandits hide in these mountains.
Very bad men.
They steal from anybody.
- Especially gringos.
- In that case, we'd better keep moving.
Go with God.
- That makes 10.
- That's right.
Shoot the horse. Shoot him!
- Bury them deep.
- Nine more of their horses are still left.
- You gonna shoot them too?
- We can't spare the food and water.
You can turn them loose.
- What's so funny?
- People.
We just killed 10 men.
Nobody bats an eye.
- When it comes to a stupid animal...
- But harmless.
Nothing's harmless in the desert, unless it's dead.
Want to face another pack of Raza's men?
- They'll head south, to camp.
- They'll head to the river, north.
Suppose they follow us? What then?
Then shoot them.
All right. Cut them loose.
God almighty.
I've known heat before, but this is...
I hate the desert.
It's got no pity.
Jake.
- Did he take his salt?
- I'll see that he gets some.
Let him sleep. You too.
How they taking it?
They'll be all right.
You'd better scout ahead tonight.
Now, beyond that ridge,
20 miles of salt flats.
Then 10 more of sand.
220 degrees south by southwest.
Our next layover, Coyote Pass.
The cemetery of nameless men.
We buried some fine friends there.
And some fine enemies.
That was a fine battle.
Outnumbered, outgunned, and still we held that pass.
Yeah, but who cares now?
Or even remembers?
Now, take that ruckus this morning.
A year ago, those men would be fighting federals instead of gringos.
- We were lucky.
- We were also stiffed.
They had us spotted back where we picked up their trail.
- Why did they sucker us into this spot?
- You're leery about the setup too. So?
Amigo, three days' ride from
Coyote Pass is another graveyard.
But instead of dead heroes, they buried gold bullion.
Two million in Spanish gold.
Melted down into beautiful bars.
Waiting for us.
We don't have to fight Raza to get it.
- It's not the reason you took this job.
- Got a better reason?
Our word. We gave our word to bring the woman back.
My word to Grant ain't worth a plugged nickel.
You gave your word to me.
Drink?
Thanks.
Yeah, takes getting used to.
Broiling by day. Freezing at night.
Alkali dust choking your body.
Who lives here long enough to get used to it?
Men, tempered like steel, a tough breed.
Men who've learned how to endure.
- Like you and Dolworth.
- Oh, no.
Men like Raza.
I wonder how long that's been there.
About an hour or so.
Dolworth put it there.
That means everything's all clear.
An upside-down cross means danger.
- Could've been put there by anybody.
- That's the idea.
Good morning, friend.
- Dolworth?
- Yeah.
- How many more?
- Three.
No guns.
- We that close to Raza?
- Could be.
At least I made out with a fine pistol.
We sure got lucky with this gringo, eh?
No wonder my mother kicked me out of the house!
- A bottle.
- You'd even frighten the dead!
Don't get carried away.
The bottle.
Where are your friends, amigo?
Here have a drink.
These shoes will be mine if they fit.
- Hey, don't I know you?
- Well, from here you look like me.
- Why you come to this place?
- You'll laugh.
It is not proper to laugh at a man who is about to die.
I came because I'm crazy about your tequila.
And I like your women.
See? You laugh.
What a funny guy, huh?
I'm gonna ask again.
Where are your friends?
I told you. I always travel alone.
It is a sacrilege to die with a lie in your teeth.
See?
Those horses and six more come back to us.
But where are the men who ride them?
I don't think you kill 10 men by yourself, buddy.
Hold it!
Stop!
I wouldn't do that.
My friend would die of a terrible headache. And so would you.
And so would you.
So wouldn't it be more sensible if we both kept our heads, huh?
Put down your gun.
If I did that, how do I know that you would still be friendly?
Do I gotta kill you to prove I like you?
Your gun, mister.
That's why I like this fool, because he's intelligent.
- Behave!
- Behave. Let it drop.
That's why I like this one, because he's so intelligent.
Thattaboy.
Come on, buddy.
Let it go already.
He's a good man after all.
You have to get over this habit of losing your pants.
- It's not dignified.
- It's draughty too.
- Don't worry. This time I'll do it.
- This time we need them.
You all right?
Makes you wonder how we ever beat the Indians.
Thanks.
Interesting pass.
You should see it from upside down.
If we hightail it out of here in a hurry, that doorway could save us hours.
It's the same shortcut for Raza.
Not if you rig it so we slam that door in his face.
Yeah?
I'll take the first watch.
If it isn't hot, it's cold.
If it isn't cold, it's raining.
How bad is that horse?
- Not too good. No bottom.
- We could all do with a rest.
Yeah.
- A shave would be a relief.
- So would a bath.
Might as well throw in a woman.
Any size, any age, any colour.
Any woman.
Mr. D...
...whatever got a loving man like you in the dynamite business?
I'll tell you. I was born with a powerful passion to create.
I can't write, I can't paint,
I can't make up a song.
- So you explode things.
- That's how the world was born.
Biggest damn explosion ever.
Dynamite in the hands of a fool means death.
In this case it could mean life. Ours.
If we're lucky...
...and get back to this rattrap, it'll be touch-and-go.
All you gotta do is light this fuse.
You got 10 seconds to run like hell.
And then dynamite, not faith, will move that mountain into this pass.
Peace, brother.
That track is the main line to Mexico City.
According to this, Grant's railroad spur branches off three miles up.
Beyond those hills... the hacienda.
Supply train.
- Government troops.
- Well, look here.
Raza.
Throw it!
Pull it!
- How are you, man?
- Good, chief. Thank you.
- Are they all Reds?
- Yes, Captain, they all are.
Well, you know what to do.
- Justice.
- Shut up!
The men on that train are Colorados.
Expert marksmen.
Also expert at torture.
Years ago, they burned and looted a town of 3000 people.
When they finished, 40 were left.
Fardan's wife was one of the lucky 40.
"Why are you a revolutionary?"
They asked her.
"To rid the world of scum like you," she said.
They stripped her naked...
...ran her through the cactus until her flesh was...
The other 39 rebels watched her die...
...and did nothing.
Just watched.
What were Americans doing in a Mexican revolution?
Maybe there's only one revolution, since the beginning.
The good guys against the bad guys.
The question is:
Who are the good guys?
- Juanito, to the north and south, okay?
- Got it.
About 60 horses, four burros.
Two machine guns from the train.
Jake.
Keep those horses quiet.
Get some more from the other side.
Hurry.
You rode well today, honey.
Perfectly.
Beautiful.
- That Mrs. Grant?
- That is a soldier.
Lieutenant Si Si Chiquita.
Now, there's a woman worth a ransom.
She never says no.
Before you blow a gasket, think you can blow the water tower?
- How do you want it?
- Like it was hit with a French 75.
Mrs. Grant could be there.
- Seems the only likely place.
- The trouble is, we gotta be dead sure.
When we make our move, there won't be time for guessing.
Coming through the gate.
- Morning. How's the wife and kids?
- Very good, very good.
Wow, there's a lot of you here.
Anybody see any cows?
No.
It's a cinch that milk didn't come from the breast of a tin can.
Our friend, the goat-keeper.
Good morning, sir.
- What is your name?
- Eduardo Padillia, at your service.
Do you recognise this?
Friends of Mr. Ortega.
That's right.
The milk that you brought to the hacienda this morning...
Who was that for?
- Who drinks it?
- Many people.
Anybody special?
The lady. Señora Grant.
She live in that room? You're sure?
- You have seen her?
- I know her from when she was born.
Her mother was dry. She was raised on the milk of my goats.
- Is she well?
- Very well, considering.
We have come to help her.
Blessed be the Lord.
May God repay you. May God...
Raza has to expect one of two things:
A messenger with a ransom...
...or an attack from the federales.
We've gotta make him think we're the Mexican army.
- The four of us?
- A whole battalion.
Now, how do the federales start an attack? Artillery.
This is our battery of field guns.
First you hit him here. French 75s.
Then here, here, here.
Carefully avoiding Mrs. Grant.
- When they run to defend the...
- We rescue Little Red Riding Hood.
We can't fight our way in.
Diversion is our only chance.
Well?
Rico, buddy, I got one of my feelings.
Something's dicey about this.
Let's pull out.
If you can deliver this dynamite with split-second timing...
...we can pull this job off.
Mr. D?
I guess we just gotta get lucky.
Jacob, this stick of dynamite weighs exactly four ounces.
If you taped that to an arrow, how far could you shoot it?
And hit the mark.
I don't like it.
- We get it wrong?
- Relax.
The stuff you're handling is safe.
These beaded sticks are trickier.
It's the heat.
Makes them sweat. Nitro.
When they're dry and cool, they're safe and obedient.
We'll leave these sweaty ones behind.
Ventilate them. Cool them.
Then maybe they'll behave.
I don't know whether it's me or the dynamite...
...that's doing all that sweating.
Four men against so many.
How will you save the señora?
- I don't know yet.
- When will it happen?
- Tomorrow. Maybe the next day.
- Not before?
- There's much to prepare.
- Speak plainly, señor.
Am I your prisoner?
I want to help the señora.
But you make me feel unworthy.
Trouble!
Show us if you're worthy.
Go greet them.
And remember,
I speak your language.
They don't give good milk if they're skinny.
What happened, old man?
Any news?
- Talk!
- Same as always. Very hot weather.
- Have you seen anyone around here?
- No.
A gringo maybe?
- Gringo?
- Yeah, a gringo.
Are you sure?
They killed and buried ten of our men.
They found the men we buried in the canyon.
Am I worthy?
If I were you, Jacob, I wouldn't use any of these for firewood.
Excuse me. I am ready to leave.
- Shall I tell the señora of your coming?
- No.
- She might behave differently.
- I understand.
By tomorrow, God willing, the señora will be safe.
Until later, then.
So you let him go.
They expect him to bring the milk.
To hell with the milk.
- What must he do to prove himself?
- He proved nothing.
He knew if he said a wrong word, he'd be shot.
What were we to do?
Watch him all night, and tomorrow?
When we go do the job, then what?
We take him with us? Tie him up?
Or were you planning killing him?
I wouldn't put that past you.
- I don't like it.
- All right.
We do the job tonight, as planned.
This fuse burns for 10 seconds.
Three seconds for flight of arrow?
- About.
- Once you light the fuse...
...you've got seven seconds to shoot.
- Clear.
Start shooting as soon as the water tower blows.
These are your targets.
That's your position.
- I have 4:17.
- Set them at 4:30.
We should have an hour before dawn.
How much time do you need?
I'll be ready by 5:00. This fuse will burn for half-hour exactly.
- Fireworks start at 5:30 sharp.
- Any questions?
- Machine gun over the lady's room?
- My job. Anything else?
Let's go to work.
Listen to me!
- Who are you looking for?
- Raza.
There are things that...
Captain.
What?
Carlos, I won't take long.
I know.
- How was it?
- Okay.
- Carlos?
- Yeah?
- Want some tequila?
- Oh, good. Thank you, friend.
Where are you all going?
I'm right here.
Good night.
- See the woman?
- Yes.
- Talk to her yet?
- No.
- How much time we got?
- About eight minutes.
- Listen to me!
- Go on.
- Go to hell!
- You go to hell!
I don't give a shit!
That Chiquita, she can lick a whole regiment...
...but she can't dance a lick.
You. Go away!
Amigo, we've been had.
Let's get the hell out of here.
- No.
- No!
Do exactly as I said.
The Mrs.
Speak only what I told you.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Call them.
Rico. All clear.
By the way, I forgot to bring your wooden cross...
...your upside-down cross.
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
You're going to injure the Mrs.
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!
They're afraid to hit the woman.
Your position is hopeless.
Put down your weapons.
Get up.
Come on, baby. Let's go.
Don't shoot.
Release the woman!
Release her!
Shoot.
Do as I say.
Shoot.
One shot from you, I'll kill her.
Get your men off that train.
Move!
Now!
Let's go! Outside.
Three against four. What happened?
- Feels like a busted rib.
- You're lucky.
The bullet went clean through.
Your hands are filthy.
What's it to you if he lives or dies?
If he lives, we'll have to slow down.
That'll give Raza a chance to catch up.
She'll work to keep him alive, all right.
Yes?
Just wondering.
What makes you worth $100,000?
Go to hell.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm on my way.
Thanks.
How is he?
He will never reach the border.
None of you.
You have no chance. You never did.
We knew everything.
From the moment you set foot in Mexico. Even before.
From the day my husband sent for you.
Mr. Ortega.
He said he would give his life for you.
For me, not my husband.
For Raza. For the revolution.
From the loyal Ortega to the devoted goat-keeper, to the faithful wife...
...at the mercy of a brutal kidnapper.
That's one hell of a rigged parlay.
I was not kidnapped.
The old badger game.
Shakedown partners, bed partners.
Cosy.
Raza and I grew up together.
I am born there.
When it's the hacienda of my father, when Raza is only a stable boy.
We are lovers long before
Mr. Joe Grant buys the place.
When my father lies dying, he says:
"Mr. Joe Grant wants you for his wife."
"You will become Dona Grant, a fine lady. That is my wish."
Here, a wish is a command.
But I'm very young and very foolish.
I tell Mr. Joe Grant
I cannot marry to him.
I love another man.
Very romantic, no?
Your husband sent you clothes.
I offer you a better bargain than I got.
Four lives. Yours, if you let me go.
You better change before we start back.
It'll be a long ride on your bare bottom.
Raza!
- How much time have we got?
- None.
Get her out. Get her out!
Mario!
Drink it.
See anything?
Sand.
They'll be along.
- How would they know which way?
- Raza will know.
You should have let me finish him.
Why didn't you kill him?
You let Raza live.
Why?
Shall I tell you?
You are simpatico. No man was more loyal to the revolution than you.
I fought like any other man.
Loyalty such as yours, that comes only from devotion to a cause.
That same fire burns in Raza. That is why you could not see him murdered.
He is a thief, trying to steal
100,000 dollars.
You are a whore cheating on your husband.
My husband stole millions from this land, our land.
If we can keep the revolution alive, with that money, for just a day...
...then I'll steal and cheat, and whore...
...and anything else that must be done.
You laugh. But you believed in the revolution once.
What else inspired you to fight for us?
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you.
I got inspired one day in May, 1911, in El Paso.
It started suddenly. Shooting, yelling, bombs going across the Rio Grande.
Everybody ran to see what the ruckus was about. Me too.
From the top of freight cars we saw across the river.
The Maderistas were taking Juarez.
The revolution had busted wide open.
It was beautiful.
The next thing I know I was across the border shooting...
...with everybody and yelling,
"Viva Mexico."
A month later I was blowing up trains for Villa.
Yes?
That's it.
Nothing more?
Not even money?
Promised, never paid.
But you stayed. You and this one.
And fought for six years, the worst years.
It's not our war anymore, Mrs. Grant.
Him, I understand.
An adventurer without principles.
But you?
Change your clothes.
We're leaving.
Raza says you and he were good friends.
- That's right.
- And yet, you would have killed him.
That's right.
For money.
That's right.
For as much money, would you let me go?
- How long since you had a woman?
- Too long.
You want me?
My price is high.
Freedom.
I might say yes now and later, no.
I trust you.
I trust you too.
You heard the man. We're leaving.
Finished.
Try a little salt, ma'am.
Make you feel better.
Ma'am...
Sorry about your horse, ma'am.
- You know something, Rico?
- Here.
That's a lot of woman there.
Beautiful. Classy. And guts.
Hard enough to kill you, and soft enough to change you.
Reminds me of another Maria.
Yours.
Amigo, don't con me.
She's going back. If I have to do it alone, she's going back.
That's what I wanted to hear you say.
What is on your mind besides
100-proof women, 90-proof whisky...
...and 14-carat gold?
Amigo...
...you just wrote my epitaph.
- How many men?
- Raza and six. Pushing hard.
Moving out.
To make the border, we gotta be out in three hours.
We got an hour, maybe less.
You have lost.
Win or lose, here and now.
Bottleneck like this, one of us might hold them off.
- One of us.
- If he plays it cool.
Hit and run. Stall and retreat.
Ehrengard needs help.
That's Jake's job.
The woman has to be watched.
That's your job.
- Buying the time we need is my job.
- Whoa, amigo. Slow down.
Let's keep this professional. Your job is to make good our contract.
To deliver the goods. All the way.
That's your job.
I got 9000 bucks coming.
In hard cash, please.
Take my horse.
You'll need him if Raza gets past me.
Bill.
See you.
Jake.
How are you going to make it back?
Well, how were you?
No!
Come on! Go on!
Sons of bitches.
Show your faces, bastards.
- Fierro!
- I got one of them.
Francisco!
Where are they?
Speak, man. Their positions!
Rico!
Fierro, is he finished?
Not yet, baby.
Baby.
Amigo.
So you are the one they left to die, huh?
Where did the bullet bite you?
In the ass.
You?
Another two inches, mamacita.
Could you spare one more cigarro?
Why, sure.
Come and get it.
Hey, Fierro!
- You want tobacco?
- Smoking is bad for the health.
How do you come to this dirty business?
The usual.
Money.
Everything is as usual.
I need guns and bullets, as usual.
The war goes badly, as usual.
Only you...
...you are not as usual.
Chiquita!
How's your love life?
Terrific.
You want some?
Don't you ever say no?
- Never.
- Anybody?
Everybody!
You know, of course, one of us must die.
Maybe both of us.
To die for money is foolish.
To die for a woman is more foolish.
Any woman, even her.
How long you think to hold us here?
Oh, a couple of hours.
Then what happens here won't matter.
She'll be Mrs. Joe Grant again.
But that will change nothing.
She is my woman.
Before. Now. Always.
Nothing is for always.
Except death.
Ask Fierro. Ask Francisco.
Ask those in the cemetery of nameless men.
- They died for what they believed.
- The revolution?
When the shooting stops and the dead buried...
...and the politicians take over, it all adds up to one thing, a lost cause.
So...
You want perfection or nothing.
You're too romantic, compadre.
La Revolucion is like a great love affair.
In the beginning, she is a goddess.
A holy cause. But every love affair has a terrible enemy.
Time.
We see her as she is.
La Revolucion is not a goddess, but a whore.
She was never pure, never saintly, never perfect.
So we run away.
Find another lover, another cause.
Quick, sordid affairs.
Lust, but no love.
Passion, but no compassion.
Without love...
...without a cause, we are nothing.
We stay because we believe.
We leave because we are disillusioned.
We come back because we are lost.
We die because we are committed.
You and I together.
I to the front.
- I will go first.
- Do as I say, woman!
A woman he will not shoot.
Jesus!
Hello, baby.
Long time since I hear "baby."
Hey, you ever find...
...that damn gold mine?
I am not lucky today.
But you're beautiful.
Querido, baby.
We had some fine times together.
Terrific.
Give us a kiss.
Mrs. Grant, let's go.
As long as we're not pressed for time.
Well, in a few minutes she'll be home.
Be nice if Bill was here for the payoff.
Be nice if he was here alive.
But stalling around won't make it so.
A cloud of dust. Could be Mr. Raza.
Could be most anything.
Even a whirling dervish.
That, gentlemen, is the whirlingest dervish of them all.
- Never thought he'd get out alive.
- And that, gentlemen...
...calls for a celebration.
What's that supposed to mean?
Rico, buddy, this will come as a shock to both of us.
- I'm a born sucker for love.
- That bullet knocked your brains out.
Or let some in.
What happened back there?
What changed your mind?
I found out what makes a woman worth 100,000 dollars.
You expect me to turn her loose?
Turn her loose? After all we've been through together?
After all the blood it's cost?
Hell, no!
You made a contract to kidnap a wife for Mr. J.W. Grant.
Now, let's collect that ransom.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.
Nicked you a bit, did they?
Help yourself.
- I'll get Mrs. Grant.
- That isn't necessary.
Hooper! Escort these men into town. See they're paid in full.
Charge hotel bills, whisky bills, girl bills, all bills. Anything. On me.
You must be anxious to get a hot bath...
...so it'll have to be adios and muchas gracias.
- A hot bath.
- Why? Is it Saturday?
You did your job and earned a bust-out. Those are orders.
The contract is not complete until...
...Mrs. Grant is delivered safe and sound.
- The code of the profession?
- Something like that.
Very well. I hereby declare our contract satisfactorily concluded.
Not yet. Mrs. Grant...
Thank you.
Maria!
- Hooper.
- Yes, sir.
Kill him.
No, no.
You haven't earned the right to kill him.
If it's not too much, I want privacy.
- Joseph!
- Not now.
There is nothing to hide.
They know everything.
Everything.
You're back again.
Nothing else matters.
I will run away again. That matters.
You're my wife. You belong to me.
I belong here.
- With him?
- With him.
I'd rather see you dead.
You're coming with me!
You're going home!
- No!
- Yes!
Gentlemen, you heard our employer.
The lady's going home.
Did you think J.W. Grant was stupid enough to pay that ransom?
Certainly not.
There was no kidnapping.
Right, Mr. Grant?
- Right, Mr. Grant?
- That is none of your business.
Wrong, Mr. Grant.
We made a contract to save a lady from a nasty old kidnapper.
Who turns out to be you.
We both made a bad deal, Mr. Grant.
You lose a wife, and we lose
10,000 dollars apiece.
You bastard!
Yes, sir.
In my case, an accident of birth.
But you, sir, you're a self-made man.
Joseph Conrad wrote:
If you want to know the age of the
Earth, look upon the sea in a storm.
But what storm can fully reveal the heart of a man?
Between Suez and the China Sea are many nameless men...
...who prefer to live and die unknown.
This is the story of one such man.
Among the great gallery of rogues and heroes...
...thrown up on the beaches and ports...
...no man was more respected or more damned than...
The story of Jim begins when Queen Victorias fleet...
...of merchant ships served a vast empire of trade and commerce.
On the day he received his sailing papers...
...Jims class proved it was shipshape.
It was a gray, overcast, ominous day...
...but not for Jim.
For him, it was the beginning of an honorable career.
He was particularly smart aloft, especially in the tgallant yards.
There, he could live out his private dreams...
...the kind of dreams most of us have.
Even on graduation day, it was clear that Jim...
...was the sort of man you would trust on sight. One of us, so to speak.
He was exactly the kind of man
I wanted on the deck of my ship.
He found life exacting, but dull.
Demanding, but empty.
Theres such a magnificent vagueness that drives some of us to roam the sea.
Such a beautiful greed for adventure and mystery.
He withdrew into a private world of fantasy.
For which of us has not dreamed of rescuing a pretty girl...
...on a picturesque raft?
In these flights of fancy, he won fame, fortune...
...and respect by saving his captain from a very nasty mutiny.
Single-handed, of course.
Jim was acclaimed, loved, and, above all, trusted.
Then, on a calm day, in a perfectly smooth sea...
...Jim met his first seagoing hazard face to face.
We put in at the nearest port...
...so that Jim could have proper hospital care.
Goodbye, sir.
The other patients were delighted to be safe on land.
But Jim craved the open sea, action.
Meanwhile, he haunted the teeming waterfronts.
He held himself aloof from the uprooted human wrecks.
How about a couple of coppers, sir?
They'll help me.
Thank you.
Directly, he could navigate without a stick.
He signed on with the first available ship.
That ship was the SS Patna.
Mister, you're looking at a dead ship for certain.
She was bound for the Red Sea.
Cargo: 800 Muslims on a holy pilgrimage to Mecca.
Good morning, captain.
I'm the new first officer.
How long you was first officer?
- Two years.
- British, huh?
The ship was peaceful, secure.
The world was firm beneath his feet.
He felt that he alone was responsible for every soul aboard ship.
He was equal to the challenge.
There was nothing he could not face.
Hey, mister, barometer dropping fast.
- For how long, sir?
- How the devil I know?
I get up, she's down.
I think soon we catch a squall.
Then maybe this old iron stove cools off, huh?
Mr. Robinson!
Cut your engines to half speed.
No! Shut up!
Keep her steady as she goes.
Hot. "Hot" is no name for it down below.
What are you doing on my bridge?
Where'd you expect me to take a breather?
Down that hellhole with them scurvy toads?
What you? Drunk?
How else can I stand this godforsaken stinkpot?
I throw you in the brig, you scum!
- What is it?
- The chart shows 100 fathoms.
- Something afloat, awash?
- More.
- We're stove in, done for.
- Where are you going?
To see if there's damage below.
- I heard something.
- No cause for alarm, sir.
- It seemed...
- It's the fog.
Makes us imagine things.
It's all right.
They only wanted water.
I felt it bulge, I swear.
There's a million tons of pressure...
...and nothing holding it back but this rusty brown paper. Paper!
- She'll go down like a lump of lead.
- Shut up!
- We'll shore it up.
- Listen.
- She's coming apart.
- Wait!
There's no time. There's 800 of them and only two boats!
- Shut your engines off!
- There's no time...
Shut your engines off!
Yes, sir.
Very sensible.
Clear thinking, sir.
Hurry!
There, in the dark, alone with the unexpected...
...Jim was finally infected with the other mans terror.
His imagination made him see what he feared to see.
Yes. Yes.
- Are we in danger?
- Only if you panic!
You must let me free the lifeboats.
Why, so you can abandon us?
You believe that?
No.
Let him pass. Let him pass.
Lend a hand, quick.
- We've got to free both of the boats.
- Sure, sure, but one at a time.
We got to clear out before the storm hits.
Push! Push!
- What about them?
- Who?
Them!
They're dead! Finished!
Nothing can save them!
- Jump! Hurry!
- Jump!
Hurry! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Hurry up!
- Jump! Hurry!
- Jump!
Well, we're all in the same boat.
We all gotta have the same story.
- I don't know...
- She sank, didn't she?
I saw her.
I saw her go down with all hands.
Gone. I swear it.
All them poor heathens.
Hey, you! It's a lucky thing we jump!
You understand?
To the trio of dirty owls...
...the Patnas rescue was proof of their desertion.
Jim saw it as a monstrous practical joke on himself.
Paper! Paper!
There never would have been an open inquiry if Jim had vanished...
...with the others.
When he insisted on making a public confession...
...the Patna affair became a public disgrace.
- What changed your mind?
- He did.
- How?
- He gave his word. I trusted him.
Evidently, you were mistaken.
Thank you very much.
The French officer, please.
- You salvaged the Patna?
- Yes, sir.
Would you say that the ship was in danger of sinking?
- Possibly. When we towed her in...
- That is not the point.
Danger is never the barometer of an officer's conduct.
Will you admit, lieutenant, that his behavior...
...was the unmitigated, inexcusable act of a coward?
It is not for me to say if another man is a coward.
Isn't that a decoration for bravery?
In a war, in front of others, one is expected to be brave.
The trade of war demands it.
At sea, we're always at war with the elements.
Officers are expected to go down with the ship.
- Honor demands it.
- Honor?
- Honor is a personal thing.
- Very well! The law demands it.
What law?
Where is such a law written?
Among civilized men, there's such a thing as the unwritten law.
An idea created by insurance companies.
Necessary because if even one crewman remains on board...
...the ship cannot be claimed as salvage.
Then loyalty. What about loyalty?
Once, there was loyalty to ships under sail...
...but when ships changed to steam, perhaps men changed too.
Could you do what he did?
Who knows?
Under certain conditions, fear will come to any man.
It's always there, waiting for us.
- The fear.
- Thank you very much, lieutenant.
Why?
Why did you insist on eating all that dirt?
How could you make that disgusting confession...
...in public, before all those grinning natives?
If you had to rut around in shame...
...why didn't you run, hide, crawl 20 feet underground where you belong?
Do you realize what you've done here today?
Do you know what you've done?
You're one of us.
Your disgrace reflects on us.
You put all of us on trial!
Don't you understand that?
Yes, sir.
I understand.
Jim! Jim!
He beat his way from port to port...
...trying to lose himself among the nameless.
He no longer dreamed of fame or glory.
He no longer wanted to dream at all.
He took on any job, anywhere, for any pay.
Up to the hotel, boy.
He craved anonymity.
He wanted, finally, to become one of the nameless flotsam...
...he formerly had scorned and pitied.
He hungered to forget his failure...
...the recurring nightmare aboard the Patna.
But the scandal followed him...
...found him...
...made him run again.
The perfect skipper had jumped, it seems, from his own ship.
His final entry in the ships log read:
If fear can find the flaw in even one of us...
...why not in any of us?
One hope kept Jim going, a hope common to most men.
Rich or poor, strong or weak...
...who among us has not begged God for a second chance?
Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump!
You did not jump with the others. Why?
Maybe I can't swim.
So much depends on this cargo.
No, wait. Please.
The fire was not accidental.
The men on your boat, you know them?
Could I ask your name, please?
Herr Stein?
Shall we put the powder in the warehouse?
No. We move it upcountry tonight.
Now, this could never show my gratitude, but...
You!
Is it really yourself, Jim, lad?
It's me, your old shipmate.
You're not gonna forget I saved your life aboard that bucket, the SS Patna.
No need to feel uneasy.
Not on my account.
I know just how you feel, mate.
It's a mean, untidy world run by toads.
What is it you want, Mr. Robinson?
God bless you, lad, just a couple of quid to see me through.
Stop. Hello.
Mr. Stein, please.
Can you show me one butterfly with a weak heart?
Can you show me one butterfly who's a 70-year-old businessman?
- What can I do for you, please?
- Mr. Stein.
- Up here, young man.
- Sit down, please.
Here, a rare specimen of life.
- Perfection.
- Beautiful.
Beauty's nothing.
Look at the accuracy, the harmony.
Fragile but strong.
The exact balance of colossal forces.
Masterpiece.
Look into the body of man for a real masterpiece.
Man is amazing, yes, but too many flaws.
Man makes too much noise about himself.
Disturbs the equilibrium.
He wants to be a saint, and he wants also to be a devil.
Always, he wants to be what he is not.
What do you think?
I think you ought not to go upcountry tonight.
Be a nice butterfly.
Stay in your cocoon.
And for this, one of these.
No smoking, no excitement.
Everything in moderation.
Even death?
If I had your strong, young heart...
Is your burden really so heavy as you look?
- No, sir.
- Good.
- I want to ship out tonight.
- That is not so serious.
Where are you bound? What port?
It doesn't matter.
That makes it serious.
I don't want your money.
Just mine, or anyone's?
- Take it. I owe you...
- Nothing.
I do not trust a man who does not respect money.
One moment, please.
If you want to be an idealist, you must also be tolerant.
Are you running from the police?
So much pride.
Even you must have a name.
- Jim.
- That's all? Jim?
A man of mystery, huh?
Today, you risked your life for who-knows-what reason.
Would you risk it again for ambition, chivalry, adventure?
Are you making an offer?
The role of a hero appeals, huh?
It might interest you to know that some men can never become heroes...
...and some heroes never become men.
And some are lucky enough to be both.
Who says they are lucky?
Now...
...if someone tries to make another fire...
...kill him.
That stuff makes you uneasy?
Well, sir, gunpowder is highly impersonal.
It will blow up anybody.
- How fast can you load and fire a rifle?
- About five seconds.
Well, this weapon can shoot five bullets in the same time.
- Is somebody gonna fight?
- Well, it doesn't have to be your fight.
- Is it yours?
- Yes.
For pleasure, profit or patriotism?
Nothing so noble.
I go to help a friend, if it is not too late.
Now, tomorrow we come to Batu Kring.
End of railroad, end of province, end of police escort.
Our destination...
...Patusan. By engine boat, 12 hours away, through enemy country...
...and no protection, sitting on all that dynamite...
...which somebody already tried to destroy.
Well...
...what do you say?
I'd say our situation...
...was highly inflammable.
What do you expect to find in Patusan?
I was rather hoping...
...to find paradise.
Patusan is like a jump into the unknown.
My first trading post was in Patusan.
And my first friend was Chief Du-Ramin.
We fought side by side against river pirates.
But today, 30 years later, the enemy is a warlord without a country...
...a precise militarist, intelligent, ruthless, and deadly...
...with an army of escaped criminals, riffraff.
The General suppresses thousands, collects taxes, also tribute.
From here, rubber. From this province, tea and precious stones.
Patusan, tin.
And those who refuse to operate the mines now work as chained prisoners!
Life is cheaper than tin.
So on a certain day, all men will mine tin or be shot.
And that certain day will be three days from now.
But on that day, people will resist.
Resist.
One old, rusty cannon, useless without that powder.
Without these weapons, it will be spears against rifles.
But if we don't get there on time...
...or not at all?
They will still resist.
- What with?
- Mostly with courage.
- Schomberg!
- Just a minute.
Schomberg!
Where is Schomberg's engine boat?
Schomberg.
Schomberg!
Hello, hello! Welcome,
Papa Stein, you look sensational.
- Where is the boat?
- Take your pick...
...sampan, sailboat, barge.
What you want, Schomberg's got.
- You promised the engine boat.
- True, true.
- Well, where is it?
- Where else? In dry dock.
- Fungus, dry rot, terrible shape.
- I will buy it.
- No, no, it's not for sale.
- But you promised.
Yeah, a promise straight from the heart.
The heart says "yes," but the conditions say "no."
All my life, I'm a victim of conditions, so it's got to be "no."
Better you don't go where you're going.
Nobody gets up that river, not alive, not since the General.
Positively not carrying contraband cargo.
- How do you know it's contraband?
- I know nothing. I don't even know you.
- You've got your business, I got mine.
- Your business is renting boats.
Please, my business is to stay in business.
You can have any boat I got, but not the engine boat.
The one at the pier rigged for sail.
- You can't push her up the river alone.
- Get me a couple of men.
That's very funny, mister.
You think everybody is dying to die?
At most, a few fools who are desperate for money. Ridiculous.
Get them!
- Get them.
- I can see you're a born leader.
Leave it to Schomberg.
Do you want a doctor?
Does he have a prescription for failure?
We haven't failed yet, sir.
Without the engine boat, there is not enough time.
- Not enough time.
- We can rig a sail.
And if there's no wind?
Then we'll row, paddle, push.
For 20 hours?
We can try.
Yes.
- Yes, we can try.
- You're not coming.
- But without me...
- We might make it.
You can't pull your own weight.
No offense, sir.
This elephant camp is halfway point.
You must reach it by morning.
After that is a little difficult and dangerous.
If you sail openly into Patusan...
...the only welcome you expect is a bullet or worse.
Now, Du-Ramin's people expect us.
His plan is simple. Also, it is tricky.
Two miles before you reach Patusan, you find these ruins.
And behind them, hidden in the jungle...
Try not to use the rifle.
Even one shot would upset the plan.
These weapons must not fall to the General under any conditions.
If such a thing happens, destroy the rifles, everything.
You are under no obligation to me, even now.
- Lf you wish to...
- Jump?
...withdraw, I would understand.
- Your man at the trading post...
- Cornelius?
- Can he be trusted?
- Why?
Well, you haven't said much about him.
You haven't said much about yourself, but I trust you.
We each have our weaknesses.
I am too romantic,
Cornelius drinks too much...
...and you?
- Goodbye, sir.
- Is there nothing I can do for you?
- Yes, sir.
Cast off.
If I knew where I could write your parents, your friends...
...and tell them... what?
Tell them...
...nothing.
Kill him.
Captain, this man wants to kill...
You see? That crazy rascal tried to kill you.
Sun sickness, I bet you.
Lucky for you, l...
- What for you do that, sir?
- Sun sickness.
That gun cannot shoot without you put another bullet in, sir...
Pick up that oar.
Sir.
General, I salute you.
Well?
Your information correct.
Coming from trading company of Stein, weapons, gunpowder.
- Weapons?
- Rifles.
How many?
The man who brought them?
Alone?
Big bang, huh?
Yeah, big bang.
'Nelius...
...you are a corrupt, depraved drunkard.
True.
- This weakness I overlook.
- The General is compassionate.
Your employer, Mr. Stein, conspires against me.
- A sentimental gesture.
- Supported by new rifles.
- Harmless, where they are.
- They are here.
- Impossible.
- Possible, probable, actual, here.
And you know it.
For disloyalty, I kill.
Disloyal to you?
You already betray the people of Patusan.
Why not me?
Because you are supremely powerful, and I am incredibly selfish.
That makes me your most loyal subject.
Cut.
- Can we bury this one?
- They cremate their dead.
Chief Du-Ramin was told?
This morning, sir!
When their women bring food, they will take him away.
Hey, General...
Chop, chop, chop.
Father, please stay in the house.
Thank you.
What hostility brings you here?
- Politics?
- Business for Mr. Stein.
I like men of business.
We have a common language:
Money.
You sell munitions, I buy.
They're gone.
Blown up. Exploded.
One explosion.
You bring nine separate barrels of powder.
So there should be many separate explosions.
Correct?
Correct.
You have two paths.
First path, we trade.
You give rifles and powder,
I give a boat...
...and freedom.
- And the second path?
It leads to the same place, only not so pleasant.
Torture.
Persuasion.
Can all men...
...be persuaded?
All.
And if it is too late?
He may have told them where he put the weapons.
Then they would not still be searching.
And while they search, we must wait.
That is why we must act swiftly.
And the dead prisoner...
...is it proper to use his body this way?
If the dead can serve the living...
...yes.
In spite of overwhelming odds, you made a noble effort.
No, please, don't deny it.
What did the General call it?
"Gallant. Admirable."
Self-sacrifice for one's own kind, yes, understandable.
Why suffer excruciating agony if you have to submit anyway?
And for whom?
For the glory of the trading company?
Look at me. Eight years of loyal service in this godforsaken hellhole.
Deserted, forgotten.
No gratitude, no respect...
...no future.
Be sensible.
Think of yourself.
- I am.
- Capital.
I'll see you have first-class treatment.
You can depend on it. Right?
Now, tell me, where is it?
Where did you hide the rifles?
- What about them?
- Who?
Them.
Nothing can save them.
Tomorrow morning, they are finished...
...as a nation, as a people.
Down the drain, gone without a trace.
- Like a sinking ship.
- Exactly. Done for.
With our without your weapons, done for.
In that case...
...why all the fuss?
You don't even know them.
Why?
Have you ever considered what makes pain unbearable?
One thing. The brain.
Put the brain to sleep, and the flesh can be burned, torn...
...twisted, chopped without pain.
Awaken the brain...
...anticipate pain...
...then every touch, sight, sound...
...becomes exaggerated.
Mind betrays the body.
And finally, the pain becomes unbearable.
Nothing to say?
You think silence is strength.
Wrong.
A man's strength is relative to his imagination.
The more imagination, the less resistance.
For God's sake, tell him. Tell him.
They'll never know you spoke, so there's nothing to be ashamed of.
Never test another man by your own weakness.
Science bores you?
This?
No man is a stranger to fear.
Fear is the perfect tool for persuasion.
Now...
...what do you fear most?
What do you prize most?
Your strong, young body?
Your manhood?
Your eyesight?
What could make you cheat a friend, forsake honor...
...desert a post of duty?
What fear could turn you into a coward?
Interesting man.
I hate him.
Naturally. He endured where you could not.
You should have killed him.
He knew I would not kill him, not until...
Of course.
He knew!
For one hour, he is not to be molested.
Attend his comfort.
Indulge your senses.
Feel life.
Eat, smoke, dream, make love.
If he wishes privacy with her, permit.
Look.
The essence of pleasure.
Warm, sweet, ripe.
A woman can satisfy all your senses at the same time.
She is the only reality.
She is life.
Death is the end of all things real.
It is the end of all feeling, desire, hope.
Death is nothingness.
And that is what you fear most. Death.
Not pain, but oblivion.
In one hour, I will ask for the weapons.
I will ask but once.
If you refuse, if you lie...
...oblivion.
One hour.
Do you believe that death is the end of everything?
Oblivion?
I believe you must leave here...
...before you learn the answer.
Then why not save one of your own people?
You, they will chase.
And while they hunt for you...
...we will get the weapons.
Sorry.
I don't mind being chased.
But I'd like not to get caught.
If you hesitate...
...we fail.
If you move too soon, we fail.
If the moon comes out too soon, we fail.
Each thing must be exact.
Cigarette?
A nice, fresh, long one, please.
Full of life.
You're the one on the boat...
...and the fire.
You know, if you'd done a proper job of sabotage...
...neither of us would be in this mess, would we?
Now, mister...
I thought it was him.
Find him.
One moment, please.
To pray for a dead soul.
Come, I shall pray for you also.
Hey. Hey!
We found the body of the dead prisoner at the monastery.
That is how the Englishman escape.
Chain them with the prisoners.
What's it mean?
That the Englishman is safe with them.
That means they have the weapons.
And that means...
...armed resistance.
Now we can resist.
To resist is not enough.
If this becomes the battleground...
...your women and children become the first casualties.
We have 10 rifles, they have a hundred.
Ours are better weapons, but they have unlimited bullets.
According to Mr. Stein, you have a cannon, a six-pounder.
Yes, but not fired for many years, buried in some old ruins.
It's useless there.
But if we place it here in the village, it brings the stockade within range.
You think the General will wait?
His men will sweep over us like locusts.
But...
...if we can keep them locked in their own stockade...
...and at the same time...
...if we can destroy the ammunition dump with a cannon...
...if we can attack on their ground...
...if we can keep them inside, on the defensive...
...if we can be ready by tomorrow's sunrise...
...then perhaps...
...we might win.
- Lf.
The night is too short for ifs!
To take human life is a sin against Buddha.
Can peaceful farmers be made...
...into an army in one night?
- Yes!
- Begin before we talk the night away.
- Can you use an old artilleryman?
Now we can fight.
Looks peaceful to me.
Too peaceful.
- What about these? Will they fire?
- Yes...
...if there was something to fire.
Bits of iron, nails, broken glass.
Why wait? Attack! Now!
- Do their spears frighten you?
- Fools frighten me.
Would you lead an attack by torchlight...
...with 500 spears waiting in the darkness?
There is the margin of victory.
Firepower.
Yes, yes.
We will slaughter them.
Yes, yes, but will we defeat them?
Rockets, like fireworks. Many.
This kite...
When the sun rises, be ready.
- You're not well.
- I'm fine.
- We have far to go.
- Women.
- Not a job for...
- lf we can plough a field...
...we can pull a cannon.
- Everything go as planned?
- Yes.
- You didn't forget the bamboo poles?
- Everything as planned.
He will need someone to lead the way.
- Lf you see a kite flying?
- We fire.
And keep firing till you hit the blockhouse.
- Lf that ammunition dump explodes?
- We have won.
Ruon.
- Lf we send up a white rocket?
- Our shot is too long.
- A red one?
- Means we are short.
I know not why...
...you've made our cause yours, but...
- Does it matter?
It matters that you risk your life for us.
No.
Goodbye, sir.
God go with you...
...Tuan Jim.
What's it mean...
..."Tuan Jim"?
A Tuan is a man of bravery...
...a man to respect.
A lord.
Yes. "Lord Jim."
- For my mother.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Why should you sorrow for the dead?
What lives once lives forever.
Many people wait here to be purified by fire.
Only then can their souls be freed from their bodies.
A proper funeral should have music and dancing...
...and fine gifts for the gods and beautiful painted towers to burn.
But it is very, very expensive.
So we wait for a rich man to die, and then...
...we quickly bring out our dead and join the cremation.
It is a happy time when so many souls come back to us.
One day, my mother's soul will return to a new life...
...sweet and bitter as the old...
...but one step closer to perfection.
The sign of the true believer.
You wear the Jesus medal, yet you beseech Buddha.
Last week, it was Mohammed.
Before that, Confucius.
I was lonely.
At times like this,
I can't stand to be alone.
Besides, I always did believe in God.
In your mouth, that is blasphemy.
What do you think of before a battle?
Killing? Death? God? A woman!
I think only of what the enemy is thinking.
- And you?
- Oh, I feel a griping pain here.
Probably something I ate.
Probably a precious stone, perhaps.
Like all things great and small...
...it will pass.
And when it does...
...give it back.
- The cannon. Is it ready?
- It is in position.
Its always there, waiting for us.
Waiting...
Its always there. Fear.
Why didn't you run, hide, crawl 20 feet underground where you belong?
- What about them?
- Who?
- Them!
- Theyre dead! Finished!
- Nothing can save them.
- Jump! Jump! Jump!
- I will go now.
- Wait! Please.
I need some help with this.
Count by ones.
- Now!
- One, two...
...three, four...
...five, six...
...seven.
- Seven.
That man, what did he want?
What does a child want when it cries in the dark?
At a time like this, most of us...
...are afraid.
Not you.
Oh, yes.
I know what they did.
You told them nothing.
Next time, I would have told them everything.
The General is a persuasive man.
He knows human nature.
String, please.
He knew how much I wanted you.
Would you have given yourself?
Yes.
Because of fear?
Because it was necessary.
It is only what we do, what we think...
...that makes us unclean.
At sunrise, we invade Patusan.
Resistance is expected.
Consequently, you will go in front.
You will form a human wall...
...a shield to protect my men.
Therefore, ask them not to resist.
Your lives depend upon the mercy of your brothers.
At sunrise, then.
Will the gods be on our side today?
- Do you wish me to pray for you?
- I already have.
That is good. To which god?
We have only one god.
That is unfortunate.
There is too much work for one god, no?
Go. Go!
Why didn't you keep firing?
I cannot...
Tuan, attack! Attack!
Fight!
If we try now, too many die.
- When it's dark.
- Thank you. Thank you.
No chains. No chains.
Thank you. No chains.
All the fuses must be lighted at the same time.
All the spears must be thrown at the same time.
- What are you waiting for?
- Darkness.
And then?
Escape.
The tunnel!
From there, under the walls.
Ingenious!
General, I salute you.
We are much more alike than I thought.
An escape hatch for all of us.
Not all.
Oh, yes. Too bad, yes.
Some are destined to fight to the very end.
A glorious death.
Gentlemen...
For what would you be willing to die?
- Willing?
- Certainly not honor.
Love?
Power?
Perhaps this treasure?
I...
...didn't know where else to go.
You are welcome everywhere, but here is your home.
You?
My mother.
The man is my father.
He came here for Mr. Stein.
I remember him...
...as a golden god.
My mother worshiped him...
...loved him even as she died.
I was born in this house.
We had many happy times together...
...until one day...
...the golden god ran away.
Perhaps, after all, he was not a god.
Mr. Stein sends other men.
They promise never to leave us, like my father.
But always, they dream of someplace else.
Always...
...something pulled them away.
Always, they leave.
You too.
You will go away, back.
Yes, back to your own kind.
I won't go back.
One day, a letter will come.
Or the whiskey soda will remind you of a woman, a dream, a memory.
- Something will make you leave.
- Do you want me to stay?
Everyone will be honored.
Do you want me to stay?
No.
Only because...
...I do not wish to die weeping...
...like my mother.
You see?
It is already too late.
Then I might as well stay.
I'll never go...
Never is forever.
Let us try to live one day at a time.
At least 10 wooden chests filled with money. Worth 50,000, maybe more.
A gallon of stones worth who knows how much.
- Ours for the taking.
- Why didn't you take them?
By myself?
I could have managed a handful...
...but with your engine boat, we get it all like a breeze.
That easy, eh?
Kill one man, becomes easy.
Well, personally, I'm not a man for killing. Are you?
So we need a specialist in these matters.
The captain of this ship is...
Did you ever hear of Gentleman Brown?
For this, we don't want any gentleman.
This gentleman, Captain Brown...
...has given more business to death than the bubonic plague.
From Java to Fiji...
...he's wanted for piracy, for slavery, for mutiny...
...for rape, murder, even some things that are not mentioned in the Bible.
- You were saying?
- On the day of the festival...
...Patusan will be like a wild and noisy carnival.
- Tea?
- Thank you.
We can be in and out before they know what hit them.
If an army couldn't take this money, what makes you think we can?
The General was too ambitious.
All we have to do is...
...eliminate a certain person.
You mean murder?
Justice.
Kill one pompous fool and...
Let's see, now. You're out, he's in, but he's the fool.
- Could I have whiskey, please, captain?
- Did you bring some with you?
Now, where is this gold kept?
Is it guarded?
If so, how? And by whom?
How do I know I can trust you?
You don't know.
- What do you think?
- I'm a silent partner.
Well, I suppose we have to take each other's word as gentlemen.
I suppose.
Fine.
If we can cut a canal from here to the river, we can ship 30 percent more tin.
Fifty percent if you had machines.
But that takes much money.
- Are you still against money?
- No, sir.
- Good.
- With machines...
...we could build a dam, which would give us two rice crops.
Wait a minute. Not so fast.
This is still their land...
...their future. They must decide.
- They have.
Waris, his father, the people.
Full approval.
Do they understand what they are approving?
Not entirely. I gave them my word.
Seemed to be enough.
I see. Well, this project is practical, yes.
It takes only one thing to make it workable.
Well, then.
All you must do is kill an evil phantom.
Let's see now, you can't kill a ghost with a bullet or a spear.
Black magic?
The weapon is truth.
You know.
That phantom's been with me a long time.
- It won't die.
- No, son. Not in the dark.
- But if you bring it out into the open...
- You expect me to tell them?
Why?
The stink of the Patna belongs to another world.
There is only one world.
The long arm of this trading company has reached across 10,000 miles...
...right here into your hiding place.
This is from Amsterdam.
"Your request for Jim, alias James, Burke...
...to represent us in Patusan is denied."
But let Chief Du-Ramin insist on Jim, as he will, and I'll back you all the way.
But no secrets.
Everybody, eyes open.
Then, if anything happens again...
I meant...
You meant exactly what you said.
You know the truth.
- Can you trust me?
- I did.
Then. Before you knew.
What about now?
Just now, you were thinking,
"lt'll happen again.
Tomorrow, the next day, when there's dirty weather. Watch out.
He'll slip, turn coward, jump."
You expect it to happen.
It'll always be there, the doubt. Waiting.
You have visitors of much importance.
Now you are one of us, it is proper to become family.
My mama.
Her mama.
Her mama.
We hope for you to happy.
They respect you.
We respect each other.
Enough to share a secret with them?
Not that one.
You won't even tell the girl?
No.
If she can trust you with her love, if they can trust you with their faith...
...why can't you trust them with the truth?
Did you take a look at them out there?
A good look?
Do you know what they felt?
What I feel right now?
The trust in their eyes means more...
You think I want to see in their eyes what I see in yours?
I earned their respect, and you want me to...
No. I can't.
I won't. I cannot tell them and stay here, and I'm staying.
Whether I work for you or not,
I'm staying.
Now, if you want to tell them about me, go ahead. Just go ahead.
You gave me this chance.
Don't ask me to throw it away.
Not now.
You know, the time of the harvest...
...is a season for gifts.
An ancient custom invented by me just now.
For your collection.
According to Professor Stein, rare, exact specimens.
Perfect.
We are only what God made us.
Nothing more.
Drunk, you're useless and unreliable.
- Sober, he's the same.
- Tell me about his man Jim.
- I told you 20 times.
- Start again. From the beginning.
Tuan!
Ruon!
- It's the lascar, hurt bad.
- Leave him.
He sounds terrible.
I think he'll die slow and painful.
- They should put him out of his misery.
- One bullet.
An act of compassion?
Good for us, bad for him.
Please, please do not let me die.
Ahoy.
Ahoy there.
This is Captain Brown.
- Is it Duncan Brown?
- Yes, sir.
Gentleman Duncan Malcolm Brown at your service.
- What do you want?
- A truce.
I'm prepared to discuss terms...
...but only in private and with the white man, the one they call "Lord Jim."
Him alone. No other.
- Is it a truce or not?
- Ignore him.
How do you ignore a fact?
Well? Yes or no?
Yes!
Jim.
I'd use it.
Yes, I think his majesty has pretensions to heroism...
...a form of mental disease induced by vanity.
Kill him. Just one shot.
You have a natural talent for disaster.
Try to improve yourself into an ordinary failure...
...by keeping your mouth shut.
My lord, it's a privilege and an honor.
Yes, well, what a waste...
...to risk so much on the drunken fantasies of the idiot Cornelius.
Pure folly on my part.
You, my lord, what brought you to lotus land?
A weapon may seem inconsistent with a truce...
...but habit...
Hunted men are creatures of caution.
Yes. Fired in self-defense.
Someone close to you was hurt?
Murdered.
The wounded lascar we left in your own personal care was like my own...
...and only sweet son.
You let him die.
And there you are.
The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh...
Now, what's our situation?
We have two choices.
One, you give us our boats, accept our apology, we leave peacefully.
Choice two, we fight.
- You'd lose.
- Granted.
But in all good conscience, my lord, is it worth even one innocent life...
...merely to remove worthless rabble, riffraff, like myself...
...who one day will die on the gallows anyway?
Really, my lord, you don't have the moral right to spend their lives.
Besides, what would you gain by our death?
Just that. Your death.
You...
...your mouth full of stinking piety.
Hypocrite!
Have you said one word touched with Christian charity and pity?
Are you so pure?
Nothing fishy about your life?
Nothing to be ashamed of?
No white man hides himself in the wilderness without a reason!
Come, my lord, what made you run from your world?
Are we not exiles, you and I, not good enough for the world out there?
Are we so far apart?
Have we not the same roots, the same skin?
Same God?
Same weaknesses?
Have you never begged forgiveness, never needed a second chance?
You'll give up your weapons.
And leave my men helpless?
I may be a scoundrel, but a deserter...
No, sir. I'd rather die than spend another day in prison.
And if we're to die, this place is as good as any.
But remember, when it comes to saving one's life in the dark...
...one doesn't care how many go down.
Do you? Three more, 30, 300.
That's the choice. Let us go, be rid of us, or fight and be damned.
Choose!
If you hear a big bell tolling...
...you'll get your boat...
...and a safe passage out.
- Lf you hear a rifle shot...
- Till when do we wait?
- Till it's decided.
- Decided? By whom? By them?
Even if you tolled the bell, is your word good enough against theirs?
Yes.
You're white, clean through.
In the name of God Almighty himself,
I trust you.
Glass.
- You should have killed him.
- Shut your gob.
- I could've gone home rich, respected...
- And dead.
Without even a penny to keep your eyes closed.
Might as well be dead as go home empty-handed.
If I am an expert judge of human weakness, depravity and avarice...
...and I am...
...we shall not leave here unrewarded for our labor.
Give them their boat.
- Let them go away.
- Why? Those men broke the law.
Now they must answer to the law.
That law is the oldest of our land.
The law of survival. Death for death.
- There's more than one kind of law.
- Which kind?
Your private law? Colonial justice?
Or is it perhaps your Christian conscience?
Perhaps.
Perhaps your conscience is colored by your skin.
His lordship has the self-righteous stench of a converted sinner.
He'll trust us to prove that we can trust him.
But what's the profit?
What's he get?
Glory.
Forgiveness for his sins.
What's he done?
It doesn't matter very much what he's done.
Just so he thinks it much.
- You said they'd go in peace.
- Yes.
- You trust their word?
- Yes.
Their word.
Ask the police of any port from Jidda to Makassar...
...about the word of Gentlemen Brown.
Tell the boy's mama...
...and her mama...
...how very sorry I am.
- Why must you go against the majority?
- Is the majority always right?
Is your conscience, yours alone, right?
Why must you take this thing on yourself?
Because I'm responsible for everyone on...
Yes. But Brown...
What is he to you, or you to him?
You owe him nothing.
This has to do with me, not him!
- This is my word, not his.
- Words.
Even for the cleanest mouth, words are a poor security.
All right.
If even one of your people dies because of what I ask...
...l'll forfeit my own life.
It comes to one thing:
- Do we trust him?
- Do you?
Yes.
Ring the bell. Close the book.
- Quench the candle.
- What's that?
Never heard the final sentence of excommunication?
- For God's sake, are we safe?
- What sinner is safe from damnation?
Father? Go to the temple, Father.
Tell the people to stay at home.
- That's my boat, all right.
- Captain, I salute you.
Yes.
Now, place all guns on the boat.
We have one objective, only one. The money.
And may I remind you that vengeance belongs to God...
...is that clear?
- That's not.
The trusting souls are even lighting our way.
Notice all of them posted downriver. Perfect.
Now, then, mister, illusion is the trick.
Make it slow and noisy.
Stall your engine, start again, keep moving, stop...
...anything to keep attention on the boat.
Your boat will be the pied piper.
They'll follow as you go.
- Take off your shoes.
- I'll stay with the boat, just in case.
Take off your shoes.
Brown!
- Captain Brown!
- At your service, my lord.
- Light your portside lamp!
- Yes, sir.
- But it'll be slow-going in this muck.
- Just keep moving. Don't stop.
Stop?
Whatever for?
Don't you fret, milord, a gentleman's word is his bond.
You won't regret this kindness.
May God bless and keep you.
- Where's my blasted first officer?
- Here, sir.
Take over, mister.
Look lively, men.
- Ready to cast off?
- Cast off!
- Hey, hey!
- Who's yelling? What happened?
Wait! Hey, it's the donkeyman,
Captain Brown, sir.
He's still ashore!
- He says he can't. He's hurt his foot.
- Go get him!
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Won't be a minute, captain, sir.
And I gotta get some steam up anyway.
Cold?
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing.
And yet, something.
Perhaps it is not a thing.
More like a feeling.
- Yes.
- You sense it also?
Yes.
Does it have a name, this feeling?
Many names.
Destiny.
Luck.
Fate.
Then all of this was meant to happen?
And of all places to happen.
Here...
...in paradise.
Patusan.
Take two letters from Patusan,
U and S.
Us.
What's left?
- "Patna."
- What is Patna?
An ugly hag of a sea witch.
A phantom ship coming to settle an old account.
Something that happened a long time ago...
...on a night like this.
In a fog like this.
Stand by, everybody! Cast off at the stern. And keep a sharp lookout!
You. You. Reconnoiter.
Clear the decks.
You show them the way.
Keep her midstream.
Starboard. More to starboard!
Don't let that engine die.
Let me talk to Brown!
I told you to watch that engine, stupid.
I found the trouble, Captain Brown, sir. It's the feed line.
Nothing can stop us now.
He's done for.
Jim. Finished.
No.
This is what they came to get.
They must not leave without it.
The windows.
We must make them come through there.
Forgive me.
We do...
...what we must.
Jim.
Jim, boy.
Here. Take the money.
Take it!
Sometimes, from a good intention comes evil...
...if God wills it so.
This was not done by the hand of God.
Nor by Jim.
His hands are not clean.
Your judgment is clouded with a father's anger.
Become a father...
...before you judge a father's anger.
But the law is without anger.
Look at your son.
Did he die in anger?
Tell him to go.
Tell him...
...to take the woman and go...
...tonight.
Thank you.
In the morning, if I find him still here...
...by his own word...
...he owes the law...
...his life.
- Ready?
- I'm staying.
Have you understood nothing?
If you stay, you die.
That's a simple fact.
Must it be explained?
Do facts ever explain anything?
I know you, mister.
You don't expect to die.
You expect a miracle.
You will strut out there like a hero.
Du-Ramin will shoot, but the gun will not fire.
Already, you hear the cheering.
Always, you hear the applause before the deed.
Your kinds of hero need victims.
You profit by their despair.
And who will be the victim this time?
This time...
...l'll be my own victim.
So you want a neat, orderly world.
Yes.
Perfect conduct for the imperfect man in his imperfect world.
- That's right.
- A quick, clean ending.
- Yes.
- Full of morals and high purpose.
What morals? What purpose?
Do you think you'll pay for the Patna this way?
I don't know any other way.
You think the world cares how you die?
I care.
But... But there is nothing in suicide.
No victory, not even salvation.
Not even peace?
There is too much pride in your humility.
Perhaps there is no best way.
But surely not his way.
Be practical. Take him and run.
Someone else said that.
"Run," he said.
"Hide."
"Crawl into a hole 20 feet deep and disappear."
How?
How do you hide with a stone the size of the Patna around your neck?
How do you end a bad dream?
The dream is not bad and not good.
Not a vice and not a virtue.
The dream exists, like the...
Like the Earth, like the sea.
The dream is you.
To end the dream, you must end yourself.
To survive a dream, you must, to the destructive element, submit yourself...
...and fight with hands and feet.
Fight to make the deep, deep sea keep you up, alive.
You must look at yourself as you are.
You must face the truth.
The truth.
What is the truth?
I've been a so-called coward...
...and a so-called hero.
And there's not the thickness of a sheet of paper between them.
Maybe cowards and heroes are just ordinary men...
...who, for a split second, do something out of the ordinary.
That's all.
I've never wanted so much to live...
...and I've never been so afraid to die.
I'll get you a new start.
You'll see.
It will be...
You're like a father to me.
Please...
...don't save me.
Help me, Papa.
Help me do what I have to do.
We both know what that is.
I don't know why things happened the way they did.
You do something wrong...
...and it begins.
You lie to yourself, and that's wrong.
You try to cover up, and that's wrong.
And once these things get to moving...
...they take their own course...
...and there's no stopping them...
...till they reach their own end.
Just being sorry doesn't change it or make it right.
And it's not even what you do...
...but why you do it.
I guess that's really the eye of the needle.
Maybe... Maybe next time you...
This is my next time.
Now...
...with the morning...
...end the dream.
Give yourself another chance.
I had my chance, Papa...
...and I lost.
But if I lose without honor...
...if, at the last moment, I weaken...
...then it's all...
...without meaning.
Wasted.

When Columbus discovered America, a series of mysteries arose to confound the scholars of Europe.
Here, are two continents, completely isolated from each other.
Yet they simultaneously developed similar cultures.
For example;
The Mayans measured time, on the same principle as the Gregorian calendar of Europe.
They used the same signs of the zodiac.
The same decimal, and mathematical system.
They valued silver and gold.
Using both for jewelry and barter.
Another mystery was the banana plant.
A native of Asia, that cannot be grown from seed.
Yet, Columbus found it thriving, in the New World.
Elephants at that time, did not exist in the Americas.
Yet there likenesses were cleaved on the walls of prehistoric caves in Peru.
The pyramids in Mexico, and in Egypt, were built on identical architectural principles...
Then there was a striking resemblance of a witch of Spain...
...and the witch depicted in the New World.
But the most significant of all...
Mayan, and Aztec legends, shared with Greek, and Hebrew and Assyrian literature...
... an account of a terrible deluge.
A deluge, many believe, had destroyed the link.
The mother empire...
...that had spread her civilization, to both sides of the Atlantic.
The Greek scholar Plato, recorded this theory first, over two thousand years ago.
There was once, another continent.
I have a bite.
Look father, there.
Damn.
What?
Come back.
Demitrius, come back.
It's a trickery of sirens.
Be careful, don't touch her.
By the trident of Neptune.
A mermaid.
The flask.
Who are you?
Who can she be?
She's not one of our people.
I don't know, but no fisherman of our village, ever came home with the catch like this?
Father.
Where is this miserable hovel, and why do I wear the garb of slaves?
You are in Greece, this is our home.
The robe is mine.
You dressed me?
Someone had to.
Where are my robes?
This cloth offends my skin. they were wet, I hung them to dry.
Our fare is simple, come.
Break bread with us, and tell us your story.
Your food tempts me not.
As you wish, my little mermaid.
I am not your little mermaid!
I'm a Princess.
Princess?
Princess Antillia, the daughter of King Kronos.
And where, is this kingdom of yours, Princess?
In the great sea, beyond the Pillars of Hercules.
Pillars of Hercules!
There is nothing beyond.
The world ends there.
You doubt my word, fisherman?
Have you ever been, beyond them?
Had we, we wouldn't be here.
Do not touch me!
You smell of fish.
We should...
We are fishermen.
Now listen.
And listen well, Princess.
In our land, we have no Kings...
No Kings daughters, no slaves.
We are all free men.
Treating one another, as we would be treated ourselves.
My son and I, rescued you from the sea.
Deliver you to safety.
Our humble best you shared.
Yet we receive insults in return.
If our home is a hovel, our weave to coarse,
Our food tempts you not Royal Princess, bestow the honor of your presents on someone else.
You may help me now.
You may help yourself.
Come, Demetrius.
There are fish to be caught.
Good evening, Petros.
You're right, Antília?
Of course, why?
Your face, so pale you look sick.
Where is Demetrius?
Spreading the nets to dry.
I will help him.
She is sick.
Demetrius...
Now neither you nor I, have anything to hide.
Will you hand me my robe, or shall I come aboard as I am.
Why, you...
Beyond the sunset, is Atlantis my home.
A land of wonders beyond compare.
Take me to it, Demetrius.
My father will shower you with riches.
Antillia, all the riches I desire,
I already possess.
All save one.
The one you will never possess, fisherman.
Antillia.
Antillia!
Stand back!
- Sit down!
- Oh!
You must be mad.
There a law against stealing a boat.
I'm going home, and no law will hinder me.
Many men have tried.
Many good seamen have sailed into the sunset.
But none has ever returned, Antillia.
Not one!
- Are you afraid?
- Yes!
And rightly so, endless terrors, lurk beyond the great Pillars.
I would rather chance it and die, than live in your village another day.
Ah, forget this foolishness.
I will not let you go.
Very well, take me back.
There are other men, braver ones, who would beg for the privilege of doing my bidding.
Put me ashore, and watch me choose my traveling companion.
Listen, Antillia.
I will take you, but only on my terms.
Before the space of one moon,
I do not sight your land...
We will return to my land.
But wait that's not all.
And when we return...
You will become my beautiful wife, forever more.
As you say, Demetrius.
Antillia!
I can no longer tell east from west, north from south.
We must shore the sail and wait awhile.
No need for that.
This will guide us.
It points always to the north.
My father would call it sorcery.
It's not sorcery it's, science.
Demetrius.
It's time we ate.
No food.
Just some wine.
'Twas only a fish.
Let me fill it.
Shh!
These are cursed waters, we're turning back.
A dolphin moans, and my
Captain regrets his bargain.
It's not the bargain, it's not the dolphins, it's everything.
The fog, the silence when the wind goes.
It's voice, when it returns, whispering to me...
Turn about.
Turn about, or you'll never moor you're lonely ship.
Listen to my lips, Demetrius.
They too whispers.
But not of doom.
Tonight will bring the full moon, and there's still nothing ahead but sea.
I shall hold you to your promise?
I will keep it.
We turn back then?
Not yet.
Our bargain is for one moon...
...no more, no less.
Demetrius.
Yes?
Is the edge of the world at the Pillars of Hercules?
No.
And have you found unknown terrors, lurking behind every wave?
Well...
Well?
Well, I did see King Neptune.
But you did not truly see him.
Perhaps not.
Have I then earned your trust?
Forever.
Then believe me now, my love.
Before the full moon dies, you shall gaze upon Atlantis. I promise.
No, Demetrius.
We're not in danger.
We rejoice, Princess.
Our Gods are kind.
They bring you safely home.
With his help, Sonoy.
A guard, take him aboard.
- The name is Demetrius?
- It is.
- Fisherman?
- I can handle the net.
Could it be then, that you were born under the sign of Pisces?
- Sign?
- When were you born?
What stars control your destiny?
The stars are but for guiding seamen across the seas.
A man who speaks with a voice of a true seaman.
My name is Zaren.
This is Sonoy, who reads the stars.
With a ship like this, I would be the greatest fisherman in Greece.
You have no ships that sail under the sea?
Ah, Princess...
Your in time.
We're about to surface.
Why isn't my father here, to meet to me?
Didn't you send word to him?
The moment we discovered you.
But he is not well...
...he's waiting for you at the palace.
- Pull him off!
- Into the dungeon!
What is this?
Let go of me!
Let me go!
Let go!
Father.
Father?
- Oh.
- Antillia.
My child.
They told me you were ill.
Ill, I have been my dear with grief and worry.
Even though the stars foretold, you're safe return.
Did the star also foretell, that a stranger would return with me?
A stranger you say?
Yes father.
A wonderful stranger.
To whom will you give my hand in marriage.
But, but I had hoped that, you and Zaren...
I have never loved Zaren,
I never will.
But wait child.
We're forgetting the law.
For me, you will change it.
Don't worry my dear, It may take a little time.
Until then, it is best you not see each other.
But now...
Now I have a thousand questions.
Thank you.
Thank you for saving my life.
Your face...
I've not seen it before.
I'm Demetrius, the fisherman.
I'm Xandros, the sailor.
Xandros.
- From my homeland?
- Yes.
And the others?
All these strange men.
Where are they from?
From land I never knew existed.
Mostly seamen like you and I, blown off course, ship wrecked, washed a shore.
We sought sanctuary...
...but found instead, whips, and chains.
How long ago?
A lifetime of suffering ago.
One loses count, of time here.
I will not be here long enough to lose count.
Those were my very words, when I was first brought here.
To your feet!
There's work to be done.
Come...
Come.
Once they were men, young and strong like you.
But how could it be?
They are monsters.
How it is done, I do not know.
But in this fowl land, there are cruelties beyond belief.
Time and again, some of us are taken away without warning.
Where?
The house of fear.
Never seen again they are the beasts of burden.
Show him what to do!
Learn well and learn soon!
Or you'll feel the bite of this!
What is that?
The crystals born in the crater, capture the energy of the sun.
The little ones, are used for heat, and light.
The big one, could destroy the world.
- Fill it, I said!
- No, no, no, no, no...
One moment, your Highness.
Clear these slaves out of the way.
Into the ditch, all of you.
Get back, move along.
Forgive this your Highness, they'll have the filth, cleared from your path in a moment.
A gift, for the Princess.
You insolent slave!
Release that chain!
Your trusted Zaren, has lied to us.
He put the man who saved my life in chains.
I want him punished.
But was I, who gave the order to enslave the Greek.
You.
His Majesty, had no alternative.
By what right do you speak for your King.
What does he mean?
The law.
The law compels us to enslave foreigners.
And you my Princess, raised in the shadow of the throne, must certainly respect the law.
But what of my promises?
And what of your word, do they no longer mean anything?
But he is a foreigner, and all foreigners are dangerous.
Indeed Princess, I've consulted the stars, they do not favor him.
- You see my dear.
- In fact the Greek should have been put to death.
Yet I spared him.
Surely this is in no way to show gratitude, to the man who not only saved my life...
...but risked his very own.
Princess, you are unduly alarmed...
... He can always gain his freedom, through the ordeal of fire and water.
He wouldn't survive, you know it.
Father, please.
You enslaved him.
Free him now!
You have changed.
When I left, you were strong.
You were a King!
It's you, who have changed.
I wish I could help my child, I...
The law must be obeyed!
How dare you presume to speak for your King!
One would think you wear his crown!
In deed you do.
Oh, Azor!
Tears are of little use, Centurion.
What has Zaren, done to my father.
And what have I done to Demetrius.
I know, little one.
Come with me, your prayers are wasted here.
These Gods are false, with hearts of stone.
Azor...
Such talk is heresy.
It is the truth.
Come.
Up their my child, there dwells the one true God, who created all living things.
The true God is the moon?
No Antillia.
His hand, fashioned the moon...
And sent it spinning, through the galaxy’s of stars.
That same hand, molded the earth, with its high mountains, and deep seas.
He gave life to you, and to me.
Pray to him, Antillia.
He will listen to your prayers.
- The earth moved again last night.
- And gave us more work to do.
Remove his chains, he will come with me.
Wait here.
My orders are not to let him out of my sight.
Only nobles, may pass through these doors.
Well this Greek, is no noble.
Neither is he an Atlantean.
The Gods do not recognize the presence of barbarians, and he is one, is he not?
- Yes, but I...
- Do you argue with your Gods?
No, holy one.
Wait.
Wait, Demetrius.
Why?
You must listen to me.
I listened once, and awoke in chains.
Isn't that enough?
It wasn't my doing.
Zaren, told me you chose to return to Greece, and I believed him.
Till I saw you yesterday.
Then set me free, now.
I can't.
Why not?
Your father is the King, who will shower me with riches, remember?
He is not the same King I left here...
Zaren, has become the power in Atlantis.
Then ask Zaren.
He would have you killed, if he knew I loved you.
Subtitle created by,
Dandysubs and cryinoutloud.
Love...
You lured me to this miserable country, by lies and trickery.
You accepted my bargain, then made me believe you loved me, to keep from turning back.
And all the time, knowing I would soon be enslaved...
... is this love, Princess?
I thought my father was above the law.
You lie.
You do not think beyond your own selfish desires.
At first, true.
But when you took me in your arms...
...my heart was yours.
Your heart, comes dear Princess.
It is not worth the price I paid.
Give it to Zaren. Give him your love, and buy back my freedom.
Even your words, smell like fish.
Stay, Demetrius!
I prefer the company slaves.
Drink.
Drink.
Now, you will close your eyes.
When you are commanded to open them again, you will be a bull.
Every day, and every way, you will become more and more, like one.
Strong, strong, strong.
Take him away.
Now bring me the Greek.
And what shall you be?
Part mule, with long ridiculous ears?
Here?
Or a...
...a buffalo, with great horns.
Here, here?
But you, unlike the others...
...will be able to remember who you are.
Perhaps this would be appropriate.
Think how it would amuse the Princess, to see you as you really are.
A filthy pig.
Yes.
I have orders my Lord, Zaren.
He allows the Greek, a chance to gain his freedom.
Why do they always, take my best specimens, away from me.
But he must face the ordeal, of fire and water.
Alright.
Take him.
I will enjoy, seeing you slowly roasted alive.
What troubles you, Azor?
The doves, look at them.
In the past, they always circle the coliseum, and then return to their cages.
Now the whole flock is winging out toward the open sea.
Father it's Demetrius, you must stop this.
I will, my dear.
But Your Majesty, you can't disappoint your faithful subjects.
Of course.
I must not.
There's nothing we can do.
By his Majesty the King...
Demetrius, is a slave no more.
Here, in the middle of our vast ocean...
...is Atlantis, our mighty empire.
But no ocean is vast enough to contain our might, our power, our ambitions.
In the past, this one great crystal was enough to supply energy for all our needs.
But we cannot live in the past.
If we are to survive, we must live in the future.
And as a monument to the future, I have cause...
...to be readied another, a greater crystal in the belly of the crater.
A weapon so powerful, that with it, Governors of Atlantis, we can become, masters of the world.
You speak of wicked things, Zaren.
Do not listen to these words of war.
It's the destiny of Atlantis, to rule the world.
Do not the Gods themselves call us, the race of masters?
And isn't it also written, conquer or be conquered?
Conquered by whom?
I shall answer you.
One country alone, may not be an enemy worth fearing.
But united with other countries, could present...
...a strength that would endanger our very existence.
No!
Atlantis, can not take that chance.
We must attack them one by one.
Our only assurance of survival, is to attack and attack soon.
No. No. No.
Let Azor, be heard.
You have arms, that can repel any invasion.
Any imaginary invasion you can conceive.
More important, we have erred, in deliberately isolating Atlantis, from the rest of the world.
We should have shared, our advancements with all mankind.
The mankind you speak of, is good for one thing.
Slavery.
A country that depends upon slavery for its existence... must perish.
Your Majesty.
Noble Governors of Atlantis.
Long before he came, it was written in the stars...
...that a Greek fishermen would reach our shores.
That prophecy has been fulfilled.
It was also written, that with his arrival, the downfall of Atlantis would commence.
The fact, that a barbarian, was able to survive the ordeal of fire and water...
...is a warning nobleman, that we will be conquered by barbarians.
Unless we conquer first.
I call for war.
We of the mountains, say war.
And for the sea.
War for the rivers.
And for science.
And the animals.
War.
War.
You, priest?
Let it be war.
Empty?
Just as all the others.
The bees have deserted us.
Strange.
Each morning of my life,
I have awakened to the singing birds.
Now only silence, greets the day.
Perhaps it is instinct, call it what you will.
But they sense something, something evil.
A strange breeze now rises, with every outgoing tide...
Blowing dead leaves, out toward the open sea.
The humblest insects, seem to know it carries them...
...not to destruction... but to survival.
Even the seeds, forsake their mother soil.
All nature senses, that the end is near.
Man alone, turns deaf ears to natures warnings.
The Princess would speak to you, Demetrius.
I have no wish to speak to her.
It is best that you do.
I'm here to repay the debt I owe you.
Tonight at moon rise, the fishing fleet sets sail from the north harbor.
Be there.
One ship bears the Kings crest.
The captain will be waiting for you.
He will take you aboard, and set you ashore, at the Pillars of Hercules.
You must find your own way from their.
Antillia.
If you suspect treachery, set your mind at rest.
The words I spoke when last we met...
...they were words of anger.
Forgive me.
Thank you, Antillia.
You owe thanks to no one.
Your farewells, were said quickly.
She loves you.
I wish it were true.
I'm leaving.
Antillia, told me so in trust.
Do you want me to stay?
To remain in Atlantis, is to die.
None will be spared.
And doomsday is not far off.
But no one can foretell the future, not even a holy man.
I was not always a priest my son.
In the days when Atlantis, was a just, and noble land, I was well versed in sciences.
But I hid my eyes, when she began to use her great knowledge for evil.
And fashioned Gods, after her own scientific achievements.
For this, we will die.
The true God, will destroy Atlantis.
But why do you stay, Azor?
Because, guilt rests heavy on my heart.
We created wonders for the good of mankind.
Then turned them into monsters.
The crystals capture the rays of the sun, the base stores the energy.
They seem identical yet, vary greatly in function.
Now, this is a model, of the original invention.
It's purpose...
Provides warmth, and light, comfort.
Feel it.
Now see what they have done with it.
That urn...
Zaren, now builds one that has a thousand times more power.
Within a moon, it will be ready, and with it, he will subjugate the world.
Why are you telling me this?
You can warn the world, your own people, when you reach home.
But what defense, have we?
None.
And if I stay...
What can I do, to halt Zaren's, plan.
Nothing now, but tomorrow may bring a chance.
I can not wait til tomorrow, my ship leaves tonight.
Demetrius...
Dawn this seamen's garb, it will make your boarding easier.
Farewell, Azor.
God, shield you my son.
All my calculations, add up to the same conclusion.
On the next full moon, you must depart for conquest.
It'll give me little time, to finish the crystal.
It is the only date, the stars favor.
It'll be ready.
One man, Demetrius, wishes to see you my Lord.
 Let him enter.
You need my help.
Why would I need the help of a slave?
Forgive my stumbling tongue, a free man.
I'm also a fisherman, who knows the waters, and lands you do not know.
I can lead your ship safely, through the
Pillars of Hercules, into the hidden sea.
I can add color, to the darkness of your chart.
Why this change of heart?
Other slaves would rather face death, than give us guidance.
I have tasted luxury, and groomed an appetite for it.
Your friends in the dungeon, will call you a traitor.
Let them.
I can find comfort in, silver, and beaten gold.
Well?
Are we to bargain with the slaves?
He will bring us disaster.
You must excuse, our impetuous astrologer.
A bargain it is.
Proceed, Demetrius.
Let me see you change, the face of the world.
What do you think, map maker?
Well my Lord is aware, that none of our ships has ever returned, from the hidden sea.
They must have perished in the, treacherous reefs, or in the shifting currents, of the Pillars of Hercules.
We therefore possess virtually, no knowledge, only speculation.
The chance, favors this, being a trustworthy guide.
I'll wager, not one detail is correct.
We'll soon see.
Guard.
You, traitorous dog!
You traitor!
Remove him.
You stinking, filthy, traitor!
You filthy traitor! You swine!
You stinking traitor!
I'll take my pay now.
Of course, Demetrius.
This is only a sample, of my generosity,
I may have need of your services again.
I would never trust this Greek.
He lies with every breath
Dwell with your stars, Sonoy, and let matters of importance, rest in my hands.
I Trust men, who put wealth, above honor.
Another warning.
I measure the lava, every day.
It rises steadily.
A sea of boiling devastation, below Atlantis.
Straining at the throat of this sleeping volcano.
Waiting for the beginning of the end.
When is the end, Azor?
Soon after the next full moon.
Soon after Zaren, and his warriors, have set sail to, conquer the world.
But if Zaren, is delayed, this conquest can never take place.
My Lord Zaren, waits impatiently.
You should have been here before this.
Look.
Another delay.
There's little time left, and the slaves, grow lazier by the hour.
They can't help me.
You must help me.
What can you do?
Nothing.
But you, a man of wisdom, must surely know a way.
There is a limit to mans endurance.
These men have reached that limit.
They must rest!
Our Priest, has a splendid remedy.
Indeed.
I have an even better one.
Captain!
A score of them, to the gallows.
That will cure, the others.
The gallows, is not the answer, Zaren.
Listen to a man, that was once a slave.
What is your remedy?
Put me in charge here.
Then, what would you do?
Put up a camp near by, the dungeon is far away.
The slaves weary, before they begin their daily tasks.
Remove their chains, discard the whip, give them decent food.
Ridiculous, why should I grant such insane demands?
You have no choice.
Very well.
Of course, my services are not without a fee.
You have sampled my generosity.
You can rely upon it again.
But if you fail...
I will succeed.
I'm awake, Xandros.
The others are waiting.
They believe as I, that Demetrius, did not betray his friends.
We're all eager to help you with your plan.
I've been thinking.
Wishing I could do something to help you.
There's nothing you can do.
Nothing anyone can do.
It slowly eats its way, through the will, of the mind...
Till I'm no longer human.
In the end, I must be locked up, with the others.
Come, we must be on our way.
I want to help you, while I still can.
Remove the wedge.
Hurry, hurry!
- Set the bit deeper.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Volcano will wake!
- Hurry, hurry!
- Destroy the crystal.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Before the full moon.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Before Zaren, sees us.
- Hurry, hurry!
- Come up lava.
- Soon, soon!
- Crystal be damned.
- Damn, damn.
- Zaren, shall not conquer.
- No, no!.
Hurry, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry...
I want to be your wife, Demetrius.
I love you.
Take me away.
I can't.
Your boat waits in the secret cove.
Let's leave Atlantis, and never return.
I have wronged you Demetrius, I know.
No that's not it Antillia, believe me.
What is it then?
I can't tell you.
Not yet.
Very well, leave me behind if you will.
But you must leave Atlantis, at once.
As soon as you finish your task,
Zaren, will kill you.
That's a chance I must take.
Please Princess, leave now, the sun will soon rise and he needs rest.
Trust me Antillia.
- Volcano will leak.
- Covering more, covering more.
- Come up lava.
- Covering more, covering more.
- Our days are numbered.
- Hurry more, hurry more.
- Destroy the crystal.
- Hurry more, hurry more.
- Before the full Moon.
- Hurry more, hurry...
- Come up lava.
- Now, now.
- Crystal be damned.
- Shh!
There, there!
No, this way.
Quick, cover the entrance!
They mustn't find the shaft.
There they are!
Go get them!
We'll, kill every last one of them!
- There!
- Don't let them get away.
Where is the Greek?
He can not be far.
Find him!
Free yourselves!
The end has come.
To the harbor!
Board the ships!
Insolent gravel!
Dare them, enter my palace.
Follow me!
No. No. No.
Antillia!
Antillia!
Antillia!
Antillia!
The water's rising, we are trapped!
No escape there, the harbor is sealed, it's flooded with the lava!
Here, this way!
Damn you.
Atlantis is gone.
But free men, wiser men...
...carried the culture, from the mother empire...
...to the four corners, of the earth.

The legend of Jack the Giant Killer was born more than a thousand years ago in Cornwall, England near Land's End.
There was a time when the kingdom of Cornwall lived in fear and trembling of the black prince
Pendragon, master of all witches, giants, and hobgoblins who ravaged the land.
But at long last, Herla the wizard drove Pendragon and all his witches from the kingdom and exiled them beyond the reaches of the known world.
Here, on a misty isle uncharted and unknown
Pendragon schemed and waited for the day when he would return to power in Cornwall.
Then, after many years, the day came.
It was a day of great rejoicing in Cornwall and kings and princes bearing gifts came to celebrate a special occasion.
Know then, Princess
Elaine that as you are by the grace of God the only child of our noble king therefore I now place upon your head this ancient coronet of the house of Cornwall.
May you wear it in honor as befits our future queen.
Rise, Elaine.
Trumpeters, proclaim the festivities.
Let the bells ring.
Health and happiness to the princess Elaine.
May she live to be a hundred years.
For the great Elaine's birthday.
Come on, move aside.
For your country.
As the people of Cornwall celebrated, Pendragon arrived.
Make way.
And now the presentation of gifts.
His Highness Vallons, Duke of Normandy.
His Excellency, the prince of Tarquin Isle Elidorus.
It is exquisite, King Meliodas.
Elidorus?
Know you this prince, Chancellor?
Never have I heard the name yet there's something faintly familiar if I can but recall.
Your most gracious majesty King Mark.
I apologize for the lateness of my arrival.
Prince Elidorus?
I cannot seem to remember.
When was it that we met?
We never have, Your Majesty.
Yet you honor my daughter's birthday?
I have always admired the crown of Cornwall.
Therefore I took the liberty of bringing
Her Royal Highness a small, but unique gift.
If you please, Garna.
Certainly, master.
Thank you, Prince.
May I see what's inside?
- Allow me, Princess.
A music box.
He walks.
Why, he could almost be alive.
A nation merchant of whom I acquired him spoke of a curious talent.
Look, Father, what an unusual gift.
I believe he wishes this dance.
Certainly, my cavalier.
Oh, you were wonderful.
What an enchanting gift, Prince Elidorus.
Enter.
More gifts.
Bring them over here.
Put them on the table.
Careful, now.
You were lovely today, Princess.
Your father was proud of you.
I think my father is slightly prejudiced.
It was nice to be remembered by so many people.
One day, it'll be a crown you'll be wearing, the queen of a mighty kingdom.
My father still has many good years ahead of him.
I don't like to think about that day.
Of course not.
When you're young, it's only today that counts.
Into bed with you.
Good night, Princess.
Sleep well, Lady Constance.
A pity to shatter your innocent dreams, Princess Elaine, but the throne of Cornwall is to be mine and only you can give it to me.
Garna, quickly.
Cormoran will meet you at the place appointed.
Be assured, Master, all will be as you wish.
No, no!
No!
- Princess.
It's the princess.
Something's happened to the princess.
Guards, guards.
The princess.
No!
No!
My daughter.
Elaine.
Elaine!
Make room.
Break it down.
Elaine, Elaine!
Elaine!
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.
A giant is running off with the princess.
Alarm, sound the alarm.
Guards, guards, stop him.
Stop him, men!
Lower the gates!
Drop the portcullis.
Get him.
Repair the bridge, men.
Axes and poles.
Guards, lend a hand.
We can't let him out of our sight.
It's been years since giants were banished.
Why would they return now?
Why?
Come on, Jonathan, Tom.
It's a beautiful day.
Whoa, oh.
OK, Tom, come on, back.
Back, back.
Oh.
Come on, Tom.
Come on, oh.
What's the matter with you two this morning?
We have to get that feed to town whether you like it or not.
Now come on, no more nonsense, back.
What's going on around here?
Well done, Cormoran.
Leaving so soon, Princess?
Why, your voyage has just begun.
No, no, no.
Let me go, please, help.
Who's to hear you, Princess?
- Please.
- Now quiet.
Please let me go.
The master has planned a nice long voyage for you...
- Please.
- In honor of your birthday.
Don't.
Cormoran!
Look out!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran!
Cormoran, after them!
Head them off.
Bring them back.
Quick, the loft.
Look out, run!
Are you all right?
You've done it.
You killed him.
It was nothing.
I kill a giant every morning before breakfast.
Starts my day right.
I think you'd better put this on.
You, farmer.
Have you seen the princess?
Your Majesty.
Kneel, girl, it's the king.
The princess, Your Majesty?
Elaine.
Young man be good enough to come down from there with my daughter.
Oh, I'm sorry, Princess.
I didn't know.
Well, young man?
We mustn't keep the king waiting.
- Elaine.
- Father.
The Lord has been merciful.
Oh, father, this is the young man who so bravely rescued me from the giant.
- Rise, my boy.
- Jack, Jack.
Oh, Jack.
You're safe.
When I saw that horrible monster...
Mother, this is the king.
Your Majesty.
Rise, madame.
Forgive me, I was so thankful to see my son alive.
I'm so thankful to see my daughter alive.
Oh, poor child, I have some hot porridge on the fire.
She'll need warmth and rest before she returns to the castle.
You've done a most remarkable deed, young man.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
I'm proud to serve the king as my father did.
Your father served the crown?
Yes, in the royal archers.
He fell at the Battle of Land's End.
A noble battle then, a noble battle now.
Your father would have been proud of you this day.
Come, let's have a look at your giant.
Hideous creature.
The boat.
The strange boat that was taking the princess away.
Hurry, Your Majesty.
But it was...
There it is the small black craft.
And there was a strange, dwarf-like man, Your Majesty.
- The servant, Garna.
- You know him, Sire?
I know him and his master.
Master.
Master.
Master Pendragon.
What happened?
Calamity, O Prince.
Most fateful disaster.
The princess where is she?
Cormoran is dead, slain by a young farmer.
By now the princess is back in her father's castle.
Impossible, you're lying.
I tell the truth, Master.
I swear it.
He took her from me at the boat and then killed the giant.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Blundering fool.
A fury take you to your torment all of you.
I scheme a thousand nights put the princess in your very hands.
And you, imbecile, idiot allow a mere farmer, a mortal, to defy me.
We have failed, Master.
We have failed.
But only for a moment.
I shall have the princess, and the farmer shall die.
By all the powers of darkness, he shall die.
For returning to us the princess alive and well as by a miracle and so delivering us from the ravages of our enemies we dub thee Sir Jack protector of the realm.
Rise, Sir Jack.
May you serve this court with honor as did your father before you.
- So be it.
- Amen.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.
- What is it, Chancellor?
We must talk privately at once.
- Can't it wait?
- This is very important.
Very well.
Attend Sir Jack, daughter.
I'll return presently.
Congratulations upon your knighthood, Sir Jack.
- I'm so proud of you, Jack.
- Sir Jack now.
I'm honored to shake your hand, Sir Jack.
At long last, a hero in the court who is young.
And handsome.
It's a bit warm here.
Would you mind seeing me to the terrace, Sir Jack?
Certainly, Princess.
Thank you for rescuing me.
You saved my life once, remember?
Hail to Sir Jack1
To Jack the Giant Killer.
Hail, Sir Jack, hail, Sir Jack.
I think my rescuer has acquired a new name.
I seem to have acquired more than a new name.
It's a great honor.
I only hope I can be worthy of it.
That's my father's way of thanking you.
This is mine.
I shall immediately go out and find another giant to slay.
Before breakfast?
Know also that these ageless giants with horns and satyr-like features who roam our Cornwall countryside destroy and plunder at the bidding of their master, Pendragon.
These records were lost among the archives of your father's reign.
I've only just uncovered them.
Then this Prince Elidorus is really Pendragon in disguise.
The prince of witches.
But why would he want to seize the princess?
Why?
If we knew that, we'd know what to do.
There's only one thing we can do.
We were fortunate this time, but Pendragon is certain to make another attempt.
I'm going to entrust you with the most important mission ever given to a Cornish knight to protect the life of the princess until she's safe.
I will certainly try to be worthy of your trust, Sire, but is one guard enough?
Our only defense is secrecy.
There aren't enough men in all Cornwall to protect the life of the princess should her whereabouts become known to Pendragon.
At dawn, you and Elaine, disguised as peasants will travel to a convent in Normandy.
When the princess is safely within its walls you will return here.
That means I'm to live in exile.
It won't be easy, Father.
Believe me, Elaine, it's the only way.
Very well, Father.
I'm ready to do whatever's best.
Go now.
Prepare yourself for the journey.
Good night, Father.
Good night, my dear.
We have plans to make and the dawn comes much too soon.
You'd better go now.
It's getting late.
Is there anything more I can do for you, mistress?
No, nothing more, Lady Constance.
I shall miss you.
And I shall pray for your safe journey.
We'll send word as soon as it's safe to return to Cornwall.
Take care of her, Jack.
No one will harm her while I live, Your Majesty.
Quiet, Gaunt, quiet.
We have a mission for you at last a most interesting mission.
Patience, patience.
Patience.
Fly straight and true, Gaunt.
Our master will be most eager for your message.
Master.
Master, Black Prince.
Look, it has come from the castle.
So you finally decided to visit us, eh, Gaunt?
Bringing a little present.
She sails with the morning tide.
What kind of a voyage is it to be, eh, Tubo?
Smooth and tranquil?
All right, lads, bear a hand on that halyard.
You, man, lay a hand there.
Heave.
Heave.
Lay your backs into it, lads.
Heave.
Heave.
Heave.
How goes it, Captain?
Fair skies and a sparkling breeze.
No man could ask for better.
I haven't seen miss Elaine since mid-morn.
Nor I.
She's not in her cabin.
Probably with the helmsman.
Come on, mind the wheel, Jack.
Peter!
Aye, Father.
Have you seen our lady passenger?
Aye, she's here with me.
Well, come up and lend a hand, lad.
We've got a landfall to make.
Aye, Captain.
He's a fine lad, your son.
That he is and smart as paint.
And he can haul a jib as proper as any man aboard.
Here you are, son.
Take over the helm.
I'll get a bite to eat.
Jack, you can give Miss Elaine her first glance at the continent.
Thank you, Captain.
Oh, you can see much better from up there, off the larboard.
Helmsman, keep her teeth in the wind.
Aye, Captain.
I didn't realize we were so close to shore.
This makes it even closer.
Do you want to look?
It's already too close.
Soon I'll be in the convent, and you'll be going back.
I'll be alone.
The sisters will take good care of you.
It's been such a wonderful voyage just the two of us.
I wish I didn't have to go into hiding that I could stay as a make-believe peasant girl.
I wish I were a genie to make your wish come true.
Suppose you were?
What would you do?
I would turn myself into a great prince and I would search every farm and village of England until I found you.
Then I would hold you and tell you that I love you.
And I would answer that I love you.
But it wouldn't be make-believe,
Jack, because it's true.
And then we'd fly away on my magic carpet and live happily together forever after.
Jack.
All right, lads, heave.
Heave.
- Ho.
- Heave.
- Ho.
All right, lay your backs to it, lads.
Heave.
- Ho.
Pipe the captain.
All hands lay to.
What happened?
Captain!
Rocks, Captain.
We've run aground.
- Mid-channel?
There are no rocks here.
- All hands lay to.
- Are you all right, lad?
- Aye.
- What did we hit?
I don't know, look at the sky.
It's turning dark.
- And we've stopped moving.
- It's unnatural.
Captain, look aloft.
Witches.
Who is it, Captain?
This voyage is accursed.
- It's the work of the devil.
- It's the devil himself.
Devil or witch or whatever you are, you may have the wind on me now, but you'll not scuttle my ship.
Witches.
We're doomed.
- Run for you lives.
- Witches, witches.
Witches.
Come with me.
Peter, up here.
- Witches.
Father, here.
Lock the door and let no one in.
- Witches.
- Witches, witches.
Witches.
A witch.
Captain, Captain.
More witches on the quarter deck.
Witches.
Sail across my bow, will you?
Father.
Father.
Jack.
Jack, Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
Look.
Jack.
Jack, Jack!
No.
No.
No.
No!
No!
Elaine!
The witches, they're going.
Father!
- We're moving.
- Look, it's getting light.
Captain.
Let's head for home.
They mustn't turn back the ship.
Captain.
Back to England it is, lads.
Make ready to come about.
Bosun, I'm taking command of this ship.
Oh, you are?
You hear that, lads?
Our passenger's taking command of the ship.
- In His Majesty's name.
- In His Majesty's name.
And where would our Royal
Highness wish us to sail him?
We're going to save the girl.
His Majesty can have this blasted tub as soon as we're safe ashore at Cornwall.
As for me, I'll not sail in the wake of those accursed witches.
Turn to, we're going go.
Listen, you men.
Sail to England and you'll all swing from the gallows.
Elaine is the royal princess of Cornwall.
Aye, and I'm the caliph of Baghdad.
Well, then, throw him overboard.
Over the side.
Over the side.
I'll get you.
Jack, Jack!
Jack!
O Isis, keeper of the magic flame, behold thy shrouded minions, demons of the dark assembled to prepare before the altar of thy eternal flame a neophyte to serve thee in thy mystic labyrinth.
Behold O Isis the eye of ancient Egypt.
Awake, Princess of Cornwall.
Open thine eyes.
Gaze deep within the sacred orb of egypt.
Bathe your innermost soul in the magic flame.
Now let the blood in your veins intermingle with the blood of the ancient spirits of the dark nether world.
Behold yourself in the mirror.
Now are you one of the mystic coven of witches.
The court of His Exalted Majesty
King Mark of Cornwall is now in session.
Let the stranger approach the throne.
Pendragon.
You dare to come here?
Guards!
I detect a chill in your hospitality, but perhaps Your Majesty does not wish to hear of the whereabouts of the royal princess?
He couldn't possibly know about Elaine.
Approach the throne.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Speak forth, Black Prince.
I merely wish to inform Your Majesty that your daughter did not reach the convent as you planned.
What have you done with her?
Where is she?
Only I know that.
I don't believe you.
You're lying.
Do you think so?
Behold.
Elaine.
Elaine.
Do you really think I am so stupid as to bring the girl herself?
That illusion was merely to prove to you that I have her in reality.
My daughter is she safe?
Perfectly, at my castle.
What is it that you want of me?
My terms are simple.
Merely that you abdicate within a week.
You may take your chancellor and any aides that you require and leave
England, never to return.
But who will rule my country, govern my people?
You?
On the contrary.
The next in legal succession will ascend the throne.
Her coronation will take place immediately after your abdication.
You mean my daughter will become queen?
You see?
My terms are generous, are they not?
With you by her side to advise her?
That may be as may be.
You have one choice to make, King Mark.
Your daughter or your throne.
In a week, I shall return for your answer.
You hold my daughter, witch, but we hold you!
Seize him.
One week, King Mark no more.
How could he have known of our plans?
Outside of the two of us?
Lady Constance!
Except for the princess and Jack only we three knew we were sending Elaine away.
Surely, you don't think it was I?
Look into that mirror.
No, no.
According to legend, if you're a witch the mirror will reflect your true soul.
All right, it was I who told the master.
Break the mirror.
Break the spell.
Oh.
Oh, forgive me.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Forgive me, forgive me.
We do not blame you, Constance.
- Forgive me.
- We pity you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Ahoy on board!
Help!
Ahoy!
Help!
Strange fish in the sea today.
Ah.
Here, drink.
All of it.
It's good, Sigurd, after it's down.
We were trying to remember if you'd ever seen these witches.
Oh, the witches.
Yeah.
Ah, I sailed these waters under Eric the Red.
Sailed in 50 ships, we did, to conquer Ireland.
Oh, it was wonderful the fighting, the plundering.
Yes, but did you ever see the witches?
Oh, the witches, the witches.
These old eyes have seen many strange sights.
Once when Eric the Red and I were sailing south we saw a school of dragons in the sea.
Yes, but these witches were in the sky and their leader had three horns on his head.
And he carried a pitchfork.
- A pitchfork?
- That shot blue flames.
Blue flames?
Sounds like
Tubo the warlock to me,
Pendragor's witch from across the sea.
Yeah?
What was that?
The imp of the bottle.
I fished him up in my nets one day.
He claims to have great powers, but he will do nothing for me.
Have a care.
Just a moment.
You ugly mean devil.
Couldn't you wait?
I asked for nothing.
And nothing you'll get, you murderous Viking.
Me power's reserved for one to me liking.
A little toy man.
Insulting a leprechaun.
A toy, you say?
Oh, for that there'll be the devil to pay.
Now hush up and listen.
Jack here is a good and true lad with with a just cause.
There's a princess to be rescued from the witches and I need help.
A noble aim, if spoken true.
Pick up the bottle I dare you to.
A caution if you've told a lie the glass will glow, and your hand will fry.
Faith, and after a thousand years at last an honest man appears.
Have you been in there that long?
He was imprisoned by the king of elves for dabbling in the black arts.
I'd finished me work, me shoes heeled and sewn.
All I did was to make me these boots out of gold.
Not just boots, seven-league boots.
Made out of the old pot of gold, you baboon to go around the world and over the moon.
You'll help me, then?
These magic coins will aid your mission if you'll agree to one condition.
When they're gone, there are only three you'll smash the glass and set me free.
It's a bargain, then.
♪ For his island we'll sail to twist Pendragor's tail ♪
♪ And the princess we'll save from that horrible knave ♪
♪ I'm off on a fling, I'll get out of this thing ♪
♪ A free man I'll be, oh, tralura tralee ♪
At least we're here, thanks to the imp.
Now to find out where he's hiding Elaine.
You think it wise for you to go alone?
I think there's less chance of being discovered.
Suppose you're caught, Jack?
We'll see if our little friend here is as good as he says he is.
Who led you safely across the brine?
You do your part, I'll do mine.
Ah.
I'd put my trust in that sword.
We'll see.
Remember to put some fresh water aboard.
Be careful, Jack.
Good luck.
We don't often have visitors.
A clever lad.
How would he fair, do you suppose against our castle's defenses?
It would be a most diverting spectacle to see.
You cannot fight these men with stone.
Look about you, seize a bone.
A bone, to fight them?
A bone to fight their magic might.
A bone to get a fairer fight.
Don't be asking questions, dunce.
Seize the bone now, at once.
Thanks, imp.
Thank me later, on the ship.
Right now, get cracking with that whip.
A magic whip.
This alters things.
He must be dealt with differently.
Enter, lad, enter.
Don't look back in that direction.
I'll take care of your protection.
Welcome to castle Pendragon.
I had a sample of your welcome outside.
I must compliment you on your valor, young man.
First you vanquished Cormoran, my giant.
Then you found your way to this island, a feat in itself.
And just now you lashed at and destroyed my dragon men with your magic whip, a stroke of genius.
A real tragedy to have come so far only to suffer failure.
You're so sure I have failed?
I am, indeed.
For you see, if you take one step toward me horns will sprout from your head.
A second step, and you will develop cloven hooves and walk on all fours.
A third step and the transformation will be complete.
You will have become a black ram.
So, you see?
Your sword can be an antidote to give you a cashmere coat.
Hold it 'fore you as you go, hilt above and point below.
No horns.
No hooves.
No wool.
Defeated, did you say, witch?
Please, let us dispense with theatricalities.
My powers are obviously completely without effect against your own.
Therefore, I yield to the inevitable.
I'm curious, how do you acquire such potent forces?
The princess.
- She is not here.
- Produce her, or die.
- She's not in the castle.
- Then where?
On the other side of the island there are the ruins of a little Roman temple.
She is imprisoned there.
Have her brought to me at once.
If you wish to free the princess you must go there.
How do I know I can trust you?
Aren't we rather forced to trust each other?
There seems no other way.
Very well.
But make no attempt to trick me.
Master, your magic what's happened?
Princess.
Out of my way, you yelping dogs, and let me think.
Never have I failed to turn a mere mortal into a cringing beast.
But he was able to withstand the strength of my magic.
It was the sword, Master.
The burning sword.
It was not only the sword, you fool.
Have you forgotten the magic whip?
He has a strange power, perhaps some ancient talisman of the black arts.
We must find the secret of this power.
Perhaps I can help.
He doesn't know I'm one of you.
Perhaps you can.
Garna.
- Yes, Master?
Take her to the ruined temple.
Yes, Master.
There you will appear to him as the princess Elaine.
- Princess, it's all right.
- Jack.
You're safe now.
Dear Jack, I prayed you'd come.
I have a boat on the beach waiting to take us back to England.
Can you walk?
I'll be all right.
Ahoy, Sigurd, Peter.
The cask is gone.
They must still be looking for water.
Well, they'll be returning soon.
I'd better make ready to sail.
I never thought I'd see you again, Jack or that I'd ever leave this island alive.
We had the luck of the Irish on our side.
Surely it would take more than luck to defeat Pendragon.
Luck and the secret of my magic weapon.
- You mean this?
- The sword?
No.
That's just Sigurd's rusty old blade.
I was talking about my friend, the imp of the bottle.
He's a leprechaun, imprisoned in the bottle by a magic spell.
We both owe him everything.
Oh, such pretty words you'd better stay till we are safe and far away.
Is there something wrong, Princess?
I guess being chained out there for so long I'm cold.
We can wait in the cabin.
This'll warm you.
Is there anything, some hot tea to drink?
Well, this brew of
Sigurd's isn't exactly fit for a princess but it is warming.
I'll pour it.
Get another cup, Jack.
We'll drink together to our escape from this island.
That I will gladly do.
I wish Peter were here to celebrate with us.
Yes, and Sigurd, too.
You'll like him.
Thank you, Princess.
To a safe voyage home.
And to us.
To a happy future.
You and I together, Jack, for the rest of our lives.
To us.
To us.
All right, to us.
Oh, it's strange to feel happy at a time like this, but when we set...
What's the matter, Jack?
I don't know.
Suddenly I feel strange, as if I were going to...
Fresh air.
She must be evil, the bottle's hot.
She pretends to be what she is not.
Watch it there!
Don't rock the ship.
Saints preserve us, I'm going to slip!
Ahoy on board.
Sigurd!
Jack, Jack.
Sigurd, come here, quick.
Your imp stands between me and the throne of Cornwall.
Where is he?
You have great magic powers.
Find him yourself.
Yes, I will.
Only twice in my existence have I been thwarted, once by Herla the wizard and this second time by you.
Herla is dead.
Yes, and I will die, too, rather than betray my king.
I shall hope to make you change your mind.
Garna.
- Yes, Master?
Peter, Sigurd.
For the last time, where is the imp?
Release the Viking.
I am afraid you were not sufficiently impressed on your first visit.
I'll give you a new demonstration of my powers.
Sigurd.
Now the boy.
Look at me.
Stop it.
Jack!
Peter!
Wait.
Jack, tell him, please.
I can't.
Look at me.
Peter, Peter!
And now, my dear, you are next.
What do you suppose would be most fitting?
A serpent?
Or perhaps a toad?
Or would you prefer to tell me where you have hid the imp?
Your loyalty to your king is touching, but your allegiance to the princess is another matter.
You have...
You have until these sands run out to convince your knight that he is being most unwise.
Garna.
I advise you, consider carefully.
Please, Jack, tell him where you hid the imp.
You've got to to save us all.
Is that why you drugged me, to get the imp?
I did it to save your life.
He threatened to kill you if I refused.
He was watching every move.
He'll kill you now if you don't tell him where you hid the imp.
Then I'll have to die because I don't know where the imp is.
You really don't know?
It's the truth, Princess.
I don't know.
You were a fool to come here, Jack.
Your fate was sealed the moment you set foot on this island.
The only thing that kept you alive was the imp.
As soon as the master returns, you die, all of you.
Princess, you are bewitched.
Break the mirror before it's too late.
Break the spell he cast over you.
Untie me!
Help me before it's too late.
And what would you save me from,
Prince Charming, my reflection?
Look at me.
Gaze upon my true self.
Am I not beautiful?
Why be the princess of Cornwall when I can be queen of all England?
Think of it.
How exciting.
A witch on the throne of England.
I forgot.
Pity you won't be there.
Peter, Peter.
That's right.
Come over here and untie me.
Over here, untie me quickly.
No!
No!
No!
Get away from there.
Get back in your cage.
Please, let him be.
Master!
Pendragon, help!
Help me, Pendragon.
Master.
Help me!
Help.
Master, no, no.
No, Master.
No, please.
No!
- Sorry, Princess.
Master!
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Garna, quickly.
Pendragon.
Master, the cage it's empty, too.
This would explain it.
Flaming gauntlets live.
Fight.
Wait.
There's a secret passage out of the castle this way.
Hurry.
No matter.
They cannot reach the boat.
Jack, Jack, come back!
The boat is just beyond those rocks.
Run for the rocks!
It's a matter of a few moments now.
At least we're safe in here.
Not at high tide.
Ahoy there, you, whoever you be, get me out of this boiling sea!
The imp.
Peter, give it to me, quick.
Hurry, imp, your last good deed.
Do it now.
- Please, hurry.
Beware of her.
She'll change your features like she did those other creatures.
She was under Pendragor's spell, but it's broken now.
Hurry, your magic.
In all the kingdom under the sea there's just one creature might set you free.
Well, throw the coin.
Call him.
Master, they're making for the boat.
Out of my way.
Master, they're escaping.
Give me room.
Can't you help us, just once more?
Oh, I would if I could, but you've had your three.
Look at me purse.
It is empty, see?
No, Jack!
Jack!
Jack, help!
Jack, Jack.
Help!
Jack!
Jack.
Jack.
Peter.
Sigurd.
How wonderful.
- Jack, come on.
- Come on.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
Sigurd.
Ah, Peter, you're restored, too.
When you killed Pendragon, it broke the spell over us.
And look at his castle.
Destroyed forever.
You'll find dry clothes in the cabin.
Just a minute.
I have a promise to fulfill.
You got a hammer?
Here, see?
Be careful, don't hurt him.
Will you be still and calm your fears?
I've been waiting 10 hundred years.
Now, watch the glass.
Just a minute.
Have a care.
The bottle turn it, give me air.
- Sorry, I was only...
- Never mind the lame excuse.
Break the glass and then let me loose.
Little imp, you're free.
Free at last, to breathe and bend thanks to you, me noble friend.
For you, Elaine, some sound advice.
Opportunity knocks, but never twice.
So if it's happiness you'd woo marry Jack.
He's the lad for you.
I intend to.
The little people are waiting for me in Ireland there, across the sea.
Ah, it is a beautiful place, the fairest of fair and me seven-league boots will get me there.
So bless you all and have no fear.
Your course for home will soon be clear.
He's gone.
What did he mean about our course?
Look, over there, in the sky.
If your homeward way you'd wend follow the rainbow to its end.
- Goodbye, imp.
- Goodbye, imp.
- Good luck.
- He was a loyal friend.
I'll miss him.
Come boy, we must get on our course.
She doesn't answer to the helm very well.
Oh, she will do to get us back to England.
To England and home.
This yacht is bringing a revolutionary
scientific invention to Gotham City.
On a peaceful motor ride,
millionaire Bruce Wayne...
... and his ward, Dick Grayson,
have been summoned to Wayne Manor...
... by an urgent but anonymous
call for help.
The invention and its custodian
are reported in grave danger...
... aboard the yacht.
Never ones
to shirk responsibility...
... Bruce and Dick, with
characteristic speed and resolve...
... descend promptly to the Batcave.
And then, as they have done
many times before...
... as Batman and Robin,
courageous warriors against crime...
... they are off, once again,
to the rescue.
Batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.
Roger. Ready to move out.
Batmobile to airport, red alert.
Prepare Batcopter for takeoff.
Batmobile approaching.
Red Alert! Gotham Tower to all
aircraft in the control zone.
Enter your holding pattern.
Batcopter cleared for takeoff.
It's good to know they're up there doing their job.
Batdrift angle: 03 to starboard.
Roger. Correcting to port.
Altitude: 317. Sink rate: 0.49.
- Drop Bat ladder.
- Bat ladder away.
Lock computer on afterdeck.
Set automatic Bathold.
Watch out. This could be tricky.
Have no fear. I'll keep all my wits about me. So long, for a minute.
Batman to Robin, ease off on the power!
Increase sink rate!
Roger! Wilco!
Take her up!
Holy sardine!
Hand me down the shark-repellent Bat spray!
- Enough pictures.
- This press conference must be brief.
- You're lucky they'll talk to you.
- Mr. Merrick of The Gotham City Times.
A yacht approaching the city is said to have disappeared.
- Nonsense. How can a yacht disappear?
- It isn't true?
I stand on my answer.
Mr. Stanley of The Globe.
This yacht belonged to the famous Big Ben Distilleries.
Isn't the proprietor,
Commodore Schmidlapp...
...bringing a new invention from Big Ben's lab?
- No more questions about that ship.
- What about that shark?
An unfortunate animal who chanced to swallow a floating mine.
I wouldn't worry about that.
You there, Miss...
Comrade Kitanya Irenya Tatanya
Karenska Alisoff.
From The Moscow Bugle.
You grace us with your presence.
May I be of service?
Please, take off the mask to give the better picture.
- Batman take off his mask?
- The woman must be mad.
Please, Chief O'Hara, all of you.
This young lady is a stranger.
Her request is not unnatural...
...however, impossible to grant.
- Impossible?
- Indeed.
If we were to remove our masks, our true identities would be revealed.
- Ruining their value as crime fighters.
- Not even we know who they are.
In fact, our own relatives don't know.
But your so curious costumes...
Don't be put off by them.
Under this we're ordinary Americans.
You're like the masked vigilantes in the Westerns?
Batman and Robin are deputized agents of the law!
- "Support your police" is our message.
- Well said, Robin.
And no better way to end this conference.
- Thank you and good day.
- Batman...
Never mind, everybody out.
Come on, we're all busy here.
A fine job. You allayed their fears.
If I'd told the truth, panic would grip the city.
The truth. And what is the truth?
A decoy. An anonymous warning...
...that Schmidlapp's in danger, to lure me into a trap.
An attempt on his life.
While they were luring you to a watery grave...
...the yacht was being hijacked?
- Precisely!
- And who behind it?
What known super criminals are at large now?
I'll check at once, Batman.
Let's have the latest status report on criminals at large. Thank you.
Coming up on the closed-circuit TV screen.
Status report. Known super criminals
not currently imprisoned.
The Penguin.
That pompous waddling master of foul play.
- The Joker!
- Devilish clown prince of crime!
If I had a nickel for every time he baffled us!
The Riddler loose too?
So it seems.
To plague us with his conundrums.
- Gosh, and the Catwoman!
- End of status report.
Could be any one of them, but which one?
Which ones?
Pretty fishy what happened to me on that ladder.
- Where there's a fish, there's Penguin.
- Wait! It happened at sea.
See? "C" for Catwoman!
Yet, that exploding shark was pulling my leg.
- The Joker!
- It all adds up to a sinister riddle.
Riddle-er. Riddler?
A thought strikes me.
So dreadful I scarcely dare give it utterance.
The four of them.
Their forces combined.
- Holy nightmare!
- Batman, could it be?
I don't know.
But I think I know where to find a clue.
Robin, to the Batcave!
We haven't one moment to lose!
Ahoy, Catwoman.
How many times have I told you?
Never use my real name in public!
You and your trained exploding shark!
How should I know they'd have a can...
...of shark-repellent Bat spray?
You sniveling sardine!
You pompous puffed-up penguin!
Friends, make peace.
Have a shake on me.
A joke a day keeps the gloom away!
Sic them, Hecate, scratch out their eyes.
- Take away that ravenous panther!
- I'll feed him to the birds.
I'll incapacitate it with my trick confetti!
"United Underworld."
We're about as united...
...as the members of the United World headquarters.
- What's the matter with you all?
- She's right.
If we don't manage to swallow our super-criminal pride...
Right, Mr. Riddler, quite right!
We must hang together, or we shall hang separately.
What a pity that would be on the eve of the greatest criminal coup ever!
- How did it go, Catwoman?
- Purr-fectly. Purr-fectly.
In my disguise as Kitka,
I penetrated their press conference.
- The fools are completely baffled.
- But undrowned.
Yes, unfortunately.
Batman's boots didn't even look damp!
Our prisoner still doesn't know he's kidnapped?
He hasn't the foggiest.
He just keeps ringing for his tea.
- There he goes again.
- Take it to him, man.
Come in.
Your tea, commodore.
Thank you, steward.
Good service aboard this yacht.
We strive to give satisfaction, sir.
Your face has the most ghastly pallor.
Are you getting enough sea air?
My duties keep me mostly undercover.
Too bad, too bad.
How much longer will this yacht be fogbound off the Grand Banks?
I couldn't say, sir.
Well, gives me a chance to catch up on my Dickens.
Still, I'd like to get to Gotham City.
I've a clever invention with me, stored in the hold.
Should be worth millions of dollars, pip-pip!
Well, pip-pip to you, sir! If you wish anything further, just ring!
Schmidlapp's invention in our hands...
...the whole world almost literally in our grasp!
And Batman and Robin still alive to block us.
Everything pip-pip with the prisoner!
He hasn't a clue.
- I bet the Dynamic Duo has.
- What?
A clue on how we made that ship disappear.
- And when they solve it...
- They'll be out to investigate.
But we'll be there first.
If we hurry, that is.
Catwoman, you tend to this headquarters.
- Attention, you unfathomable finks!
- Yo-ho!
Call down to our secret river-bottom dock.
- Prepare our submarine for sea.
- Yo-ho!
- Yo-ho what?
- Sir!
Holy Merlin magician!
Get set for a shock.
The Batcamera was aimed at the yacht.
- My strange hunch was right.
- I don't get it...
Think! As you remarked, no one can make...
...a seagoing vessel simply disappear.
Provided it was ever really there at all.
- You mean...?
- Precisely!
The yacht we thought we saw was a mere illusion.
A tricky projection akin to the common desert mirage.
It deceived our naked eyes...
...but was blocked by the Batcamera's Batfilter!
I know where that projection came from.
- Observe that bell buoy.
- What about it?
The coordinates of our position were 10.3 by 69-B.
Feed those figures into the navigational aid computer.
No legal bell buoy at that position.
As I surmised, an illegal projection buoy cleverly camouflaged.
Maybe the crooks left fingerprints!
Good thinking, let's find out.
To the Batboat, fast!
One thing I don't dig, Batman.
If that ship was a mirage, where's the real one?
Taken to some secret island hideaway with every soul aboard, save one.
- Commodore Schmidlapp?
- Precisely.
For some reason the hijackers needed him...
...or his invention as part of their criminal scheme.
Keep an eye on the scope.
Watch for suspicious vessels.
It looks like we've got the whole ocean to ourselves.
Diving planes, Mr. Bluebeard, three degrees.
Hoist three degrees.
I hope you know what you're doing, Penguin.
Mr. Riddler, I ignore your insipid insinuation, sir!
Mr. Joker, you're leaning on the control!
Don't sound so bossy, if you please!
As the poet says:
"On land, you may command.
At sea, it is me!"
Now hear this. This is your captain speaking, my fine pinioned pirates.
We're approaching the buoy.
There may be skullduggery ahead!
- Yo-ho!
- What? What?
Unidentified small craft, bearing 113.
Mr. Bluebeard, hold her steady!
Up periscope!
Great quivering icebergs!
Just as I hoped.
Watch your step.
An underwater shark cage.
The source of that fish.
What cruelty!
Stuffing a poor shark with deadly TNT!
Nothing's sacred to those devils.
Torpedoes! What are we waiting for?
Chain of command, Mr. Riddler.
The Penguin runs the ship.
Now hear this, Mr. Joker.
Load the torpedo tubes!
Load torpedo tubes!
Salt and corrosion.
The infamous old enemies of the crime fighter. No prints here.
Look here, Batman.
That tricky mirage projector must be behind this plate.
Wow! What a set of superpower lenses!
No wonder we were fooled.
Look, Robin.
Holy Long John Silver!
A pirate periscope!
He spotted us! Set torpedoes to automatic homing.
Set torpedoes to automatic homing!
You crazy bird.
Fire them off, quickly!
Activate the remote control
Penguin magnet inside that buoy.
Holy glue pot! What's going on?
The fiends! They've converted this buoy into a gigantic magnet!
It's got us by the metallic objects in our utility belts.
Torpedo tubes armed!
Batman! We're helpless in this monstrous, invisible grip!
- Steady, Robin. I see one hope.
- What, Batman?
If I could just pry loose my utility belt transmitter!
- Mr. Joker, are you ready to fire?
- Yo-ho, ready to fire!
Five, four, three, two.
- Fire 1!
- Fire 1!
Torpedoes!
If I can just reverse the polarity, send out waves of super energy.
- What happened?
- Mr. Joker, fire 2!
Fire 2!
Here comes another one!
You and your reconditioned surplus torpedoes!
He must be using a super energy reverse polarizer! Mr. Joker, fire 3!
Fire 3!
Here comes a third one!
Confound it, the batteries are dead!
This one's getting through!
It is. It's getting through.
Surface, Mr. Bluebeard!
Let us feast our eyes on the watery remains!
Gosh, the nobility of the almost-human porpoise.
True, Robin.
It was noble of that animal...
...to hurl himself into the path of that torpedo.
He gave his life for ours.
Operator, give me the Pentagon,
Navy department.
Too bad.
Admiral Fangschliester's office.
Hello, Batman speaking.
- Who is it?
- Batman.
Oh, Batman.
Hello, Batman. Ahoy!
What can I do for you?
Hello, admiral.
A routine question.
Have you recently sold surplus submarines? If so, to whom?
Just a moment,
I'll have to look that up.
Keep practicing.
Answer: Affirmative. We disposed of a surplus submarine on Friday.
A pre-atomic model.
To some chap named P.N. Gwynne.
- P.N. Gwynne?
- The Penguin!
Did this P.N. Gwynne leave an address?
Just a post office box number.
Would you like it?
No, thank you, admiral.
You've been very helpful.
Your tone sounds grim.
We haven't done anything foolish?
Disposing of submarines to persons who don't even leave their addresses?
- Good day, admiral.
- Gosh!
The Penguin in command of a pre-atomic submarine!
- Grave situation, Robin.
- If only we knew what he was up to!
Holy Polaris!
From that submarine, no doubt.
That missile, it's written something.
A riddle, in the form of a joke!
Let's race back to headquarters.
You know what this means, don't you?
Our fear is confirmed. Penguin,
Joker, Riddler, their forces combined.
- Heaven only knows the objective!
- It may be worse.
- Saints alive, how can that be?
- Look at this pair of riddles.
"What does a turkey do when he flies upside down?"
- He gobbles up.
- And number two.
"What weighs 6 ounces, sits in a tree and is dangerous?"
- A sparrow with a machine gun.
- Of course.
Now, combine both answers.
What kind of creature would gobble up a bird in a tree?
Heaven protect us, a cat!
Yes, the criminal catalyst in this entire affair...
...our old archenemy, Catwoman.
Penguin, Joker, Riddler and Catwoman too!
The sum of the angles of that rectangle is monstrous.
We've been given warning.
They work to take over...
- Gotham City?
- Any two of them might try that!
- The whole country?
- If it were three, I'd say yes.
But four?
Their minimum objective must be...
...the entire world.
The United World building, dear comrades in crime.
Our objective, the Security Council.
Sitting like fat birds in a tree just waiting to be snatched.
And you bungled it!
The Dynamic Duo escaped our trap!
Passing porpoises which intercept torpedoes!
There ought to be a piscatorial statute!
Time is short! We've got to get Batman before he gets us.
I could lure him into a giant exploding octopus...
After one of your fishy explosions, they're still in one piece.
I suppose they'll be broken up by your moldy jokes!
Shut up, all of you!
I see the way to do it.
We'll play each of our treacherous trumps in one hand.
And we'll do it right here!
- How?
- How?
The end.
The end of...
We shall spring them from the Joker's jack-in-the-box...
...through that window, out over the sea...
...and into the waiting arms of the Penguin's exploding octopus!
The trigger? One of my riddles.
And the bait? You, Catwoman.
You're mad.
The minute Batman spots her...
...he'll bop her with a Batarang.
You don't understand.
She will be disguised as Kitka.
And as Kitka, she shall lure some millionaire into a kidnap trap.
Of course!
With a clever clue pointing here.
- Batman will race to the rescue.
- Capital!
But who are we going to kidnap?
I know the perfect victim.
I know the perfect victim! I know!
Bruce Wayne, the millionaire head...
...of that disgusting do-gooding
Wayne Foundation.
Delicious! Just the sort of square citizen Batman will dash to rescue.
- Then snap!
- Into the combination trap.
Purr-fect, Riddler, purr-fect.
Comrade Wayne? My name is Kitanya
Irenya Tatanya Karenska Alisoff.
I'm from The Moscow Bugle.
My friends call me Kitka.
Kitka. Kitka, a charming acronym.
Thank you, Comrade Wayne.
The Wayne Foundation is known from Leningrad to Kamchatka.
It works for peace and understanding.
Your picture has appeared countless times in The Moscow Bugle.
I'm most grateful,
I wasn't aware of that.
You found these riddles on Wayne
Foundation stationery under your door?
Yes, Comrade Wayne.
That's why I brought them to you.
I thought it was some foolishness, then I remembered:
Is there not a bourgeois criminal cad...
...the Riddler, who preys upon the workers?
Your jargon is quaint, Miss Kitka.
But there is such a creature.
What do we do now? Report these riddles to your police...
...or perhaps to that Cossack Batman?
That's hardly necessary at the moment.
Doubtless it's the work of some harmless crank.
Nevertheless, shall we give this matter further consideration...
...over dinner tonight?
What a purr-fectly lovely idea.
I'll telephone to cancel a previous engagement.
Alfred will see you to the door.
Do vechera.
Do vechera, Comrade Wayne.
Alfred, see Miss Kitka out, please.
Meet me in the Batcave. Emergency.
Very good, sir.
Listen to these riddles.
Tell me if you interpret them as I do.
- "What has yellow skin and writes?"
- A ballpoint banana.
Right. "What people are always in a hurry?"
Rushing people? Russians!
Right again.
What would you say they mean?
Banana, Russian...
A Russian will slip on a banana peel and break their neck!
Precisely, the only possible meaning.
- A clear threat to Miss Kitka's life.
- Who?
Miss Kitka, the charming Russian journalist for The Moscow Bugle.
In some way she must have unwittingly stumbled on the criminals' plot!
What is the scheme?
Tonight Bruce Wayne will go out on the town with Miss Kitka.
- A not displeasing chore.
- Indeed.
I've rarely met a girl...
...who's a potent argument in favor of international relations.
You will dog our footsteps in the Batmobile.
You'll keep watch via the Batscanner.
- If the Riddler tries to make good...
- I'll bash him brutally.
Then we close in with the police.
- Got your driver's license?
- In my wallet.
Good man. Drive carefully. Good luck!
This may be a memorable night.
This curtain which separates our countries is so foolish.
If we could just contrive...
...some way of getting more deeply involved with each other.
Da, we must search for such a method.
It's wrong to listen to this.
Some things have to be private, even for a crime fighter.
Your discretion is admirable,
Master Robin, yes.
- Time for another check-in.
- Roger.
- Commissioner.
- Yes?
- Yes, Boy Wonder.
- Batmobile position:
Gotham Park, proceeding south on West Drive.
About to pass
Benedict Arnold monument.
Still in the park? It's been almost an hour. What are they doing?
No comment, commissioner. Let's just say, no sign of criminal activity.
Yes, I understand.
I've just thought of a clever ruse.
Have Chief O'Hara flash the Batsignal.
If you say so, but why?
The crooks will think we're racing to headquarters.
Thinking we're out of the way, they might strike at Miss Kitka!
Devilishly clever!
- Thank you. Batmobile over and out.
- Right.
- Chief O'Hara, flash the Batsignal.
- Yes, sir.
Shades of Smolensk, what is that?
Incredible, I don't...
- Of course! How clever.
- Clever, Comrade Wayne?
I mean, clever device, Miss Kitka.
It's the Batsignal, from the roof of police headquarters.
Batman must be racing there in response.
Then you did get the police to call them in for my protection.
Yes, yes.
How purr-fectly wonderful of you!
I close my eyes and I dream of those savage Cossacks...
...racing over the steps on their mission.
How strange.
I close my eyes, and I dream of something...
...quite astonishingly different.
Keep your eyes closed.
Continue with this dream.
The dream continues.
It approaches a climax.
Not so fast. Be more slow.
Miss Kitka?
May I see you home to that penthouse apartment?
- He swallowed the Catbait!
- And now to make him Batbait.
Finks, Morgan, Bluebeard, Quetch, the jetpack umbrellas!
I'll slip into something more comfortable...
...while your cocoa is warming.
Is that prudent?
Our instructions were to keep watch.
I don't know about prudent.
But it's the only decent thing to do.
Perhaps. Yes, yes.
There it is, 73rd Street and Concord Avenue.
Follow me down to the terrace.
And all my days are trances
And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eye glances
And where thy footstep gleams
Edgar Allan Poe, Miss Kitka.
"To One in Paradise," first stanza.
About that dream you had...
- Do we dare?
- Why not?
Yes, of course. Why not?
Of what use is a dream if not a blueprint for courageous action?
Into action, comrade.
Miss Kitka,
I have the strangest feeling...
...that I am about to be utterly and madly carried away.
- This is a kidnapping!
- Our joke's on you!
You filthy criminals!
- Much as one deplores indiscretion...
- Right.
I'll just take one tiny, tiny peek.
- Holy demolition!
- Bless my dustpan!
Cover the exits.
I'll race up with my Batrope!
Holy Halloween!
Strange, Batman should've been here hours ago.
Maybe you didn't leave a clear enough clue.
I did! I can't understand why
Batman hasn't dashed into our trap.
He puts his foot here, my secret jack-in-the-box fires...
...shooting him over the sea...
...into the waiting arms of Penguin's exploding octopus.
What a deliciously humorous trajectory!
And nothing to link us with the crime.
You abominable outlaws!
What have you done with Miss Kitka?
She's quite well, Mr. Wayne.
I swear by heaven, if you've harmed that girl...
...I'll kill you all.
I'll rend you limb from limb!
Mr. Wayne, must you be so impulsive?
Where is she?
Show me Miss Kitka...
...or I'll wreck this place with my dying breath!
Blindfold the captive.
Lead him down the labyrinthine path to chamber 17.
Two minutes, no more.
- Turn on the secret microphone.
- Quiet, quiet!
- Miss Kitka.
- Comrade Wayne.
Are you all right?
I'll curse myself forever.
This nasty soup we're in is of my brewing.
If I hadn't let your beauty lull me off guard...
Off guard, comrade?
There are some things
I cannot disclose.
But we're in the hands of the most vicious foursome.
I fear we have nothing
to look forward to but death.
It may not be that black,
Comrade Wayne.
Batman and Robin are probably hot on our trail.
From something
I happened to overhear...
... I think we are merely
bait for Batman.
Once he's in their trap,
we'll be released.
A slender hope, Miss Kitka.
More slender than you can know.
You do not think
Batman will get here?
That I cannot say.
Did you overhear any mention...
...of any other prisoner of this rotten gang?
No, I did not.
Who on earth could you mean?
Commodore Schmidlapp ringing for his tea.
Just a thought, it doesn't matter.
Speedy escape is our only hope.
A moment, while I think...
Why didn 't I think of it sooner?
Of what?
Up my sleeve I have a radio transmitter strapped above my elbow.
- What a curious device to carry.
- Not at all.
Capitalists who carry a lot of money have safety contrivances.
If I can just get at it...
Wiggle around back-to-back.
Maybe you can reach it with your fingers.
Let's get him.
There we are.
You think you're pretty clever, don't you?
- Clever enough to outwit you.
- We'll see about that.
Dear colleagues, let's see what's strapped above his left elbow.
Cretinous creatures!
I knew you'd been listening in!
I told you that fish story about a radio...
Get him!
Miss Kitka! Where are you?
- Great day!
- Hello, commissioner.
Dick, we're late for that demonstration. Excuse us.
But you can't dash off now.
How did you escape?
- With the aid of Batman.
- Thank goodness for the Caped Crusader.
Return to police headquarters.
He may wish to call you.
My fine finkish friends, you have heard my astounding proposal.
What do you say?
What do you say?!
Our strike cannot be postponed.
We're at the mercy of the Gotham River tide.
It's now or never to get through the channel.
Batman will never come here now.
But the police will, any instant.
So, to the Penguin's princely plan.
Is it yes or no?
It's crazy, but let's try it.
We have to get Batman out of the way.
Oh, go ahead, Penguin.
Would you drop one of your dream pills into Commodore Schmidlapp's tea?
- Presto!
- Then carry him to the submarine!
Mr. Riddler, will you tell Mr. Quetch...
...to fetch the five guinea pigs?
Fetch the guinea pigs.
Yo-ho-ho, sir!
Now, my fine fishy finks...
...you see the commodore's pièce de "no-résistance"...
...an instant whiskey maker.
Waiting for us to put it to more universal use.
Don't be afraid.
You'll feel nothing.
I am merely going to temporarily extract...
...every bit of moisture from your bodies!
It's a painless operation.
- Delightful!
- Dehydrated!
Catwoman, will you get a dustpan...
...and put every one of them very carefully into separate vials?
Mr. Riddler, would you prepare the submarine to get underway...
...while I prepare a terrifying demolition charge for the police?
- Where do we meet?
- United World building.
Gotham River.
39th floor. The elevator.
- One hour?
- One hour.
What criminal genius, Catwoman!
Who but a genius could conceive such an audacious plot?
To trick Batman and Robin into inviting me to their Batcave...
...with five dehydrated death-dealing pirates at my command.
Careful, careful.
Every one of them has a mother.
Out, Batarang and Batrope.
Stand clear.
With people in weird outfits like the supercrooks around here...
...it's amazing no one reports this place to the police!
It's a low neighborhood, full of rum pots.
They attribute curious sights to alcoholic delusions.
Drink is a filthy thing.
I'd rather be dead than unable to trust my own eyes.
Yes, honey. There was someone walking up the wall.
Ready with super-blinding Batpellets.
- Away, Robin. Away!
- But...
Come on, Batman.
Batman!
Miss Kitka!
Quick, everyone!
Flee for your lives! Into the street!
Some days you just can't get rid of a bomb.
- It's all right.
- Holy heart failure!
I was able to dispose of that bomb just in time...
...and shield myself behind these iron pipes.
You risked your life to save that riffraff in the bar?
They may be drinkers, but they're also human beings...
...and may be salvaged.
I had to do it!
But we lost the trail of Miss Kitka.
Stranded without a clue!
Ahoy there! Could you chaps direct me to a policeman?
Commodore Schmidlapp's the name.
Big Ben Distilleries, you know.
- Holy costume party. The Penguin!
- Obviously.
What's his game?
- What's your game, Penguin?
- Penguin?
No, my name's Schmidlapp, old boy, Schmidlapp.
Your fingerprints will settle that hash.
We'll check them against our mobile anti-crime file in our Batmobile.
Let's see your hands.
Looks like plastic-coated fingertips!
Yes, I scorched myself pressing a waistcoat.
I do believe the attending surgeon did use plastic, yes.
It looks bad.
This brassy bird has us buffaloed.
Not quite.
There's one method of identification no one can evade.
Retinal eye patterns?
He's right. The pattern of blood vessels...
...in the retina, as individual as a fingerprint.
Don't you have an anti-criminal, eye-pattern master file...
...in your Batcave?
Why don't you take me there?
- You'll submit yourself to a test?
- It might be an amusing experience.
Stand by to catch him, Robin.
I'll give him the Batgas.
What? Batgas?
An anesthetic, necessary to prevent you from seeing...
...the entrance to the Batcave.
If anyone knew that, they could pierce the secret of our identities.
Ready, commodore?
Oh, I say, what deucedly strange customs you colonials have!
Well, I'm ready.
To the Batmobile.
This could be our break.
- I wonder why he let us take him?
- We'll soon know.
- I've got the eye checker.
- Stay on the alert.
After I give him the Batwake, we must be ready for anything.
Oh, it's you.
We're here, eh? I see.
Oh, what's this? Oh, say!
This is extraordinary!
It's absolutely extraordinary!
I must say that your laboratory exceeds the limits...
...of man's wildest imagination.
Could I trouble you for a glass of water?
Your Batgas has left me with a parched sensation.
The water dispenser is clearly marked.
All right, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Help yourself, commodore.
Slake your thirst.
You'll have worse than a parched sensation when we're through.
Perhaps, perhaps. But I am appalled by your attitude, sir.
Condemning me before the facts have been authoritatively established!
You are abrogating my constitutional rights, sir.
All set, Batman.
Come on, Penguin.
Time to rip off your false feathers.
Coming, Batman.
I'm coming at once.
Holy hallucination!
I wish it were, but it's five dehydrated pirates, rehydrated!
At them, me hearties!
Shiver them from stem to stern!
Attack them, you faltering fink!
They're gone! Popped like balloons.
How did it happen?
Whoever dehydrated those pirates...
...couldn't have foreseen their rehydration with the heavy water...
...we use to recharge the atomic pile!
It left them in an unstable condition!
You saw it yourself. The slightest impact was sufficient...
...to instantly reduce them to antimatter.
Antimatter?
You mean, they won't be coming back?
No, Robin. Not in this universe.
Let that be a lesson in the dangers...
...of tampering with the laws of Mother Nature.
My apologies, commodore.
I've done you a cruel injustice.
- You have?
- You were duped. Brainwashed.
The criminals planted those dehydrated thugs on you.
You were obviously under the influence...
...of post-hypnotic suggestion when you rehydrated them.
Come on down, commodore.
Another sniff of Batgas, and we'll all return to the city.
Are you sure you didn't hurt your head?
Perfectly. Swallow this pill.
Now, give our friend here a whiff of Batwake.
Good morning.
What's wrong?
Manifold pressure's dropping.
We'd better stop and check it.
- Sorry about that. Won't take long.
- Yes, you will!
And away we go in my Birdmobile!
One side kick for a sailor.
- You okay?
- Thanks to that anti-Penguin gas pill!
He's played right into our hands.
Via Batcycle to the Batcopter!
We'll track him to the gang's new hideout.
Disengage go-cart.
Batscanner tracking the stolen Batmobile.
Port two degrees, then steady as she goes!
Yo-ho, port two degrees!
We're almost there!
- Where are you going?
- To fire off more riddling clues.
Riddler! You're mad!
Penguin's finished Batman by now.
That miserable, waddling mountebank of a bird!
He couldn't finish a bag of popcorn!
Say Penguin failed. All the more reason not to hand them clues.
But I must! Outwitting Batman is my sole delight...
...my joy, my heaven on earth, my very paradise.
Riddler, come back!
Stolen Batmobile turning, heading up Gotham River Drive.
Polaris-type missile coming right for us!
Hold on! This may be tricky.
- Damage?
- The tail rotor's disengaged.
Brace yourself, Robin, we're going down.
This could be the end.
Now, to find my riddling
Polaris skywriter!
Look! Look, the Dynamic Duo!
I got them. I got them.
Holy horseshoe!
Some luck, landing on top of foam rubber!
The odds against it would make even the most reckless gambler cringe.
True, I did think I'd spotted it out of the corner of my eye, but...
That crazy missile wrote two more riddles.
"What goes up white and comes down yellow and white?"
An egg!
"How do you divide 17 apples among 16 people?"
Make applesauce.
Apples into applesauce.
A unification into one smooth mixture.
An egg, nature's perfect container.
The container of our future hopes.
A unification in a container of hope?
United World Organization!
Precisely!
And the Security Council meets today.
- If what I fear is true...
- Let's commandeer a taxi.
No, not at this time of day.
Luckily we're in tip-top condition.
It'll be faster if we run. Let's go!
We are now passing through the grotto.
- Depth, a half-fathom.
- Engines, dead slow astern.
Dead slow astern.
As the blueprint said, an abandoned construction elevator.
Hecate, sniff out the weak spot.
- I hope Penguin made it.
- Who needs him?
Stand back.
Hey! Can't you read?
A fine day for penguins.
My co-conspirators, we meet as planned.
No thanks to you, the Dynamic Duo has been silenced forever.
Blasted out of the sky by a coincidence!
The delicious irony of it!
Downed by Riddler's Polaris skywriter.
Happy happenstance! Hold your breath till we cross the hall.
There are still lingering traces of my finely filtered Penguin gas.
Holy marathon! I'm getting a stitch!
Let's hope it's a stitch in time that saves nine.
The nine members of the Security Council.
It is the opinion of Her Majesty that we pursue peace at all costs.
Our poor united world in microcosm.
I'm afraid they'll find our humor very, very dry.
We understand your position, but for peace...
It has always been our policy...
Quickly now!
Each one in a separate vial.
And, boys, don't anybody sneeze.
- Seal the building!
- Turn off the ventilating system!
The Security Council may have been dehydrated!
Emergency, operator.
Get me security.
Emergency, operator, emergency!
Up, up, up, up!
- Surrender! You criminals!
- The United Underworld is through!
What's this, an apparition?
One false move, and you'll find out.
We'll hurl our Batarangs!
- To the elevator!
- Catwoman! Stop, I said!
I don't think you mean that.
Miss Kitka dies if you take one more step! Go!
This way, Robin!
The Security Council, gone!
What a fiendishly clever way to abduct nine men...
...from a heavily guarded building!
Where does that elevator go?
Downstairs, to an abandoned submarine dock on the river.
Holy Captain Nemo! They'll head for sea by way of Short Island Sound.
We have just one trump card left.
Heaven help the world if we fail.
Come on!
Down periscope.
We're over the last bar.
Mr. Bluebeard, all engines full ahead.
Yo-ho, all engines full ahead!
What a delightful haul!
Mr. Riddler, will you prepare those nine radio ransom messages?
And no stupid riddles.
Make those messages plain.
One billion dollars cash, from each country.
Precisely! To be delivered to our secret island...
...by the horde of trained carrier pigeons which I shall provide.
No whimsical embellishments.
Make those messages clear!
Make those messages clear!
It's like a dream, Pengy-sweet.
Nothing can stop us now.
Sonar contact.
Range 8000. Bearing 181.
Yo-ho, sonar contact.
Small craft at 7500, bearing 01.
Small craft?
It's moving fast.
Range is down to 7000.
- The Batboat!
- Drat that cockleshell!
Mr. Bluebeard, steady on the diving planes.
I'll man the torpedo tubes.
Would you fire a surface-to-surface underwater homing missile?
Missile ahoy!
It has a homing device in its nose cone. Take evasive action.
No use. It's tracking us!
Take my Batradio.
I looked it up this morning.
That class of missile receives on a wavelength of 164. 1.
- Quickly! Send a jamming signal.
It's starting down.
Farewell, Batman!
Farewell, Dynamic Duo!
Holy bikini, that was close!
Yo-ho, small craft still closing.
Range 4000. Bearing 88.
They know how to jam our missiles.
Up to periscope depth!
Yo-ho, up to periscope depth.
- Range 3500.
- Get the Batcharge launcher.
Roger!
They hold nine of the world's most eminent men in dehydrated condition.
Our task is not to sink that sub, merely to drive it to the surface.
Forward torpedo tubes, prepare to fire.
Yo-ho! Forward torpedo tubes, prepare to fire.
Five, four, three, two...
...torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes, fire!
Torpedoes away!
- Dive, Mr. Bluebeard, dive!
- Yo-ho, dive.
Down periscope.
Torpedo off the port bow!
Prepare to fire Batcharges in front of torpedoes.
That's too soon!
It must be Batcharges!
And that means there'll be more of the dread things meant for us!
You dismal bird!
You and your submarine!
Shut up, you feline floozy!
Mr. Bluebeard, down 30 fathoms.
Run silent, run deep.
They're diving, silent engines.
I'll circle them at full-thrust speed, diminishing radius of curvature.
Roger.
What's their bearing?
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know?
It's changing every second.
They must be circling us.
Fire when ready.
I'll maintain curvature.
Yo-ho! Compartments A, B and C taking in water, sir!
Penguin, you know I can't take water!
You cowardly kitten, you want to live forever?
- This bird has flown around the bend!
- To cuckooland!
Riddler, Joker, do something!
We weren't meant for a watery grave!
Now hear this! Now hear this!
Blow all tanks! Surface! Surface!
Cut the Batcharges.
They've had enough, I imagine.
They're surfacing fast.
- Estimated surfacing position?
- 200 yards.
Here they come.
Diminishing speed. Ready to board.
Roger.
Pirates! To arms!
Prepare to repel boarders!
Strike your colors!
We have not yet begun to fight!
Attack!
Bon voyage, pussy.
Holy heartbreak! Miss Kitka!
Batman, I...
Say no more, Robin.
It could be compromising.
Of course.
It's just one of those things in the life of every crime fighter.
It means nothing.
Snap on the Batcuffs.
Batman to coast guard.
There's a submarine two miles east of Sandy Nose.
It's filled with human jetsam.
Come, take it in tow.
Robin. Over here, look.
The hope of the world, tottering on the brink!
Holy almost!
To think, it might have been shattered before our very eyes.
- Up, Catwoman.
- The service here has gone to pot.
What the devil is this?
The captain's costume party?
Holy jumble!
Where's the hope of the world now?
Batcentrifuge at 32,000 rpm.
Increase angstrom force in vector X.
Vector X up one notch.
- Yes, commissioner?
- What progress? Is there hope?
There's always hope.
But do you think you and Robin can separate that mingled dust...
...back into its constituent members?
With all modesty, commissioner...
...if we can't, heaven knows who can.
Truer words were never spoken.
Howdy, you all.
How are those boys doing up there?
Batman says there's hope,
Mr. President. What more can one ask?
The free world is waiting. Tell Batman
I salute him and wish him luck.
I needn 't tell you
with whom I have just spoken.
Ready for separation.
All right.
I'll activate the computer link.
Input the ethnic and national factors.
- Batman, wait a minute!
- What?
Well, with the way the world is and all...
...maybe we ought to try to improve those factors?
- Reshuffle them a little.
- No.
It's not for us to tamper with the laws of nature.
In this very Batcave, you saw a ghastly example...
...of what happens when one tries to do that.
Gosh, yes.
When you put it that way...
Here we go.
Separation accomplished.
Ready to rehydrate.
Separation accomplished.
They are ready to rehydrate.
We are ready to rehydrate.
They are ready to rehydrate.
A solemn moment, gentlemen.
One of dedication and humble supplication.
Robin, prepare to rehydrate.
Ready to rehydrate.
Turn on the water faucet.
Success! Success!
They've done it!
They've done it!
Success, success!
We've done it, we've done it!
Success! Success!
What the...?
In the interest of peace, you must hear me out!
Gentlemen, it is imperative that we limit our conversation to peace.
Who knows, Robin?
This strange mixing of minds...
...may be the greatest single service ever performed for humanity.
Let's go, but inconspicuously.
Through the window.
We'll use our Batropes.
Our job is finished.

- Professor Ragheeb.
- Send him in, will you?
Good afternoon. Mr. Saeed?
Mr. Saeed's away, I'm afraid.
My name's Sloane.
Away? Why is he away?
Flu, Professor.
Medical men aren't immune. He asked me to look after his appointments.
I'm only checking your glasses. You look as though I want to drill your teeth.
Do sit down, Professor.
Ragheeb. That doesn't sound English.
Are you English, Professor Ragheeb?
- Why do you ask?
- Oh, small talk, merely small talk.
The weather's too dull and politics too explosive.
I certainly didn't mean to pry.
- May I see your glasses?
- I can't see anything without them.
- Yes. Yes, indeed.
- Please.
- Have you been exposed to flu recently?
- Does that weaken the eyes?
No, merely the eye doctors.
There's so much close personal contact in our line, we can't be too careful.
Now... let's just try these.
There.
- Read those letters in the mirror.
- "A."
"N, D."
"A, O, H, T."
Not bad. Now the other eye.
"H, C, U."
"D, H, L, E."
- "M." No. "N."
- Jolly good.
Look up at me, Professor.
I want to put some drops in your eyes.
- Why?
- To dilate the pupil.
It's quite all right, Professor.
You won't feel anything.
- There. That didn't hurt, did it?
- No, it was...
Here on the final slide is an example of a more cursive form of hieroglyphs, probably from the reign of the great Pharaoh Ramses II.
Now we can still recognize what many of the signs represent.
Here, for example, is the word for "heart", written simply with the picture of the heart.
But here, above the monster Amensit, who, as you can see, is part crocodile, part lion and part hippo, and who waits to devour the heart of the dead man is the glyph for a house.
Below it is a mouth.
These signs have phonetic value only.
They are followed by a drawing of a pair of legs, which, in this case, has no phonetic value.
As an ideogram, it does give us the clue to the meaning of the word
"to go forth".
Sex.
I thought there must be some way of attracting your attention, Mr. Fanshaw.
I seem to have been talking in your sleep.
That will be all for today.
Professor Ragheeb will be back tomorrow.
Good morning.
May I have a word, Professor Pollock?
If it's about that outstanding bill at the bookstore, there's a simple explanation: poverty.
- No, it's nothing like that.
- In that case, how do you do?
My name is Sloane.
Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane of Her Majesty's
42nd Highland Fusiliers, retired.
- Marvelous.
- Yes, quite.
I'm private secretary to Mr. Nejim
Beshraavi of the shipping lines.
- The Nejim Beshraavi.
- I didn't think there could be two.
Mr. Beshraavi would like to see you in London, so if you'll follow me, please, the car is waiting.
Mr. Sloane, this is Wednesday.
Shall I tell you about my Wednesdays?
Right now: a healthy jog and a couple of tutorials, an indescribable lunch with the faculty at 12:45...
Mr. Beshraavi will pay you well for your time.
And I could use it,
I don't mind telling you.
But, as I said, not on Wednesdays.
Good morning, Mr. Sloane.
You people really can't take no for an answer, can you?
What do you think you're doing?
Let me go!
Good Lord, a-aren't you...
Mr. Pollock, may I present
His Excellency, Mr. Hassan Jena?
- Well... Mr. Prime Minister.
- Good morning, Mr. Pollock.
I am Mr. Jena's Ambassador to Great Britain, Mohammed Lufti.
Mr. Ambassador.
Please forgive this unorthodox method of making your acquaintance.
Please, don't mention it.
There's nothing like a kidnapping now and then to keep the circulation going.
The fact is that there are very few men on this Earth whom I admire more than you.
You're a very great man.
No man is greater than the people he serves. Your respect must be for them.
Yes, sir. I...
I didn't know that you were in England.
You are quite right. I am not.
You have not seen me.
The first favor I would ask of you is to help keep my visit here a secret.
Of course, sir. And... And the second?
You know a fellow countryman of mine,
Mr. Nejim Beshraavi.
The Nejim Beshraavi.
Yes, our richest and most powerful citizen.
We have every reason to believe he intends approaching you with a business proposition.
He already has, sir, but I turned him down.
- Oh, dear.
- Wrong?
Your association with him could have been valuable to the cause of freedom.
How?
All we know is that Beshraavi is opposed to our programmes and plans some violent exercise of that opposition in the near future.
We have to find out what he intends doing and when.
You want me to re-establish contact, accept his offer and see what I can find out?
We want that very much.
But you must not accept until you know all the possibilities.
The assignment carries a certain amount of risk.
Is that a statesmanlike way of saying that I could get killed?
Mr. Beshraavi respects no one's life but his own.
If you wish, I will stop the car and let you out with nothing further being said.
For generations, the Pollocks have devoted themselves to uncovering the past.
I think it's probably about time that a Pollock involved himself in the future for a change.
As soon as you have any information, you will contact Mr. Jena in London.
Ambassador-2779.
Words cannot express my gratitude.
Mr. Pollock, very good of you to reconsider my proposal.
I always try my best to cooperate with the very rich, Mr. Beshraavi.
Do sit down.
You mustn't mind Hassan, Mr. Pollock.
- Hassan?
- He's a peregrine falcon.
I've named him Hassan Jena after our beloved prime minister.
They share so many sterling qualities.
A sharp eye, a fierce dedication, and very sharp claws.
Hassan won't harm you, Mr. Pollock, if you don't separate him from his master.
He is excessively loyal.
You keep him well fed, I trust.
Of course. Nobody's that loyal.
I won't presume upon your time,
Professor.
I know how valuable it must be.
What do you make of that?
It's a copy of a Hittite inscription.
Second millennium BC, I would guess.
Take a date, Mr. Pollock, as a gesture of friendship.
I'm a very Arabian Arab, I'm afraid.
Friends?
Flesh, Mr. Pollock.
Hassan eats only flesh.
- I thought he looked at it wistfully.
- It must have been your fingers.
I want to know what that inscription means.
I want to know that very much.
May I ask an indelicate question?
- How much?
Very well. I won't quibble, $30,000.
You go right ahead and quibble.
How did you happen to get hold of it?
Let us say,
I happened upon it by chance.
Oh.
Well, may the... gods continue to smile on you.
Thank you, Professor.
I value your good wishes.
But I won't keep you from your work any longer.
If you haven't finished by 8:00 tonight, you'll be...
- Tonight?
- That is correct.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt your threat.
- If I'm not finished by 8:00...
- Then you'll be my guest for dinner.
I see.
If I should happen to run just a smidge over?
You'll find this house a comfortable place to work in, Mr. Pollock, however long it takes you.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
What are you doing?
Oh, these English crosswords are devilish, don't you think?
- You're an American.
- Yes, sir. Indeedy-do, ma'am.
I don't meet many Americans.
Actually, I don't meet many people who are dressed like that either.
Do you like it?
Would you do me up, please?
- Oh.
- Can you manage?
Well, I...
I always tremble when I'm happy.
- I take it you're a houseguest here.
- Why do you take that?
One doesn't usually arrive for high tea dressed in a nighty.
One also isn't a houseguest in one's own house.
Oh, it's your house. I got the impression it was Mr. Beshraavi's house.
Nejim gives that impression with everything he borrows, but I assure you it is my house, and he's the guest.
Would you care to stay for dinner?
I'm afraid that our street urchin has already invited me.
How bothersome.
You are working on the cipher, aren't you?
Let's not talk about work.
Let's talk about you.
Listen,
I don't know what Nejim has told you...
There you are, Yasmin.
I hardly expected to find you here.
- In her own house?
- In the library.
Yasmin has so many talents, she has practically no time for reading.
I'm sorry to tell you this, my dear, but
Mr. Pollock is as poor as a church mouse.
- Will you come and change for dinner?
- Excuse me.
Those slippers are absolutely beautiful, my darling.
- Are you wearing them for my benefit?
- Of course.
Mr. Pollock does not have your exotic refinements.
- He prefers nighties.
- She said it, I didn't.
Mr. Pollock, some Bedouins are in the habit of saying to their guests,
"All that I possess is yours".
I am not one of them.
Delicious, Beshraavi. What is it, squab?
- Lark.
- Lark? Good heavens.
They've been soaked in honey for eight days.
What about you, Mr. Pollock?
Or is the prospect too exotic?
I trust you'll notify my next of kin.
Go on, Mr. Pollock. Courage.
Oh, I am sorry.
That's all right.
I've always had a sweet tooth.
I hate being clumsy. I despise it.
But you never are, my dear.
This is the first time
I've seen you be so gauche.
You've dropped something, Mr. Pollock.
Well... so I have at that.
What do you suppose it is?
It looks like a little piece of folded paper, doesn't it?
Let's see if there's anything written on it.
Was that you? I'm terribly sorry.
Let's see if there's anything written on it.
There is something written on it.
Don't keep it a secret. What is it?
It's a prescription.
I suffer from indigestion.
All those dry books I try to digest.
Perhaps we can have it made up at the chemist just around the corner.
- Don't bother.
- No bother. One of the servants...
It would be for them.
It's absolutely unnecessary.
I think I'd better be getting back to work.
The dinner was delicious, and... that was quite a lark.
Well...
He certainly was strange, even for an American.
I'm sure you and Mr. Beauchamp have business to discuss, so I'll develop a splitting headache before your talk gives me one.
- Good night, Mr. Beauchamp.
- Good night, Miss Azir.
When are you going to let me show you around my bank?
The moment I find myself in need of refinancing.
You, I'll see later, no doubt.
Beauchamp, you've been oozing good fellowship all evening.
When a banker oozes, someone's in trouble.
Let us have your bad news.
I was too discreet to mention it in front of your guests, but do you know what they've been saying about you on the exchange?
Your brokers gossip like Arab women at the well.
They say when Prime Minister Jena arrives the day after tomorrow, he will sign the treaty.
They say the treaty specifies
Anglo-American finance in return for a promise your country uses English and American tankers.
They say your ships will be laid up for good.
- Do they?
- If they go on saying that, old boy, in a week your shares will be down ten points.
Don't worry. There will be no treaty signed, old boy.
I happen to have in my employ a most dependable soothsayer.
Psst. In here.
Now then, Miss Azir, I wonder if you'd tell me what this is all about.
Call me Yasmin.
At least while you're in my bathroom.
Now then, Yasmin, I wonder if you would tell me what is going on?
Professor Ragheeb didn't fall out of any window.
They murdered him!
Beshraavi?
I doubt if it was him personally.
- How do you know?
- What difference does it make?
They killed him, and they'll kill you too. You'd better keep out of this.
Me? Why should Beshraavi have anything against me?
He needs me to decipher the inscription.
- And when you've done it?
- Good point.
The message is too important for anyone he doesn't own to know about it.
What about you?
Lock, stock and barrel?
This is ridiculous.
We're in England, a civilized country, in the middle of London.
Over there is Regent's Park.
There's the zoo.
Over in Buckingham Palace, the Queen is probably playing Scrabble.
He can't own anyone here.
Everyone has his price.
How much, Mr. Pollock?
I did not settle so cheaply.
Why should you care what happens to me?
I care about all things that live,
Professor.
$30,000 in exchange for your old age is a very bad bargain.
Do you know...
- Who is it?
- Yasmin, why have you locked the door?
Yasmin? Can you hear me?
I was about to take a shower, darling.
You know how I despise locked doors.
Forgive me, Nejim.
People who lock doors generally have things to hide.
Would you care to search me?
Would I find your thoughts?
Well?
Darling, don't ask me to speak with my mouth full.
You know, at dinner, just for a moment,
I thought you deliberately knocked over the plate and gave a note to Mr. Pollock.
Imagine. That really is extraordinary.
- Jealous? You?
- I'm jealous of your thoughts, Yasmin.
I'm jealous of everything I can't see or hear. Your shower's still running.
- I'll turn it off.
- No, take your shower.
Maybe I won't tonight. I'm so sleepy.
In that case, please do.
I want you wide awake.
There now. Wasn't I right?
Isn't that refreshing?
You might say that.
- You feel wide awake now?
- Yes... but I wish I weren't.
You sound very tense, my love.
Turn around.
Let the water run down your back.
- It soothes the nerves.
- I don't think it would.
- Nejim?
- Yes?
Why is Mr. Pollock working on that inscription?
It's a business matter.
It would only bore you.
- What was that?
- I dropped the soap.
- Should I pick it up?
- Oh, no, no, I... I'll manage.
Somehow.
- Have you got it?
- Yes, darling. It's all right.
Extraordinary sensation. Perhaps it was the way he looked at you.
- Who?
- Pollock.
Darling, if you start getting jealous over everyone who looks at me, it will do terrible things to your blood pressure.
I don't think you have to worry about college professors.
- Why not?
- They're only interested in work.
They're the most dangerous kind, my love. They're such expert peekers.
Don't worry. If I were standing stark naked in front of Mr. Pollock, he'd probably yawn.
I think it's time I dried you.
Excuse me, Yasmin. The phone.
- Yes?
- Mr. Beshraavi.
Yes, what is it, Sloane?
I don't know where Mr. Pollock is, sir.
- Isn't he in the library?
- I don't think so, sir.
He was your responsibility.
- What about the cipher?
- I don't know, sir.
Well, go and check.
Yes, sir.
- Mr. Pollock.
- Yes?
- Do you have the inscription?
- It's in my pocket.
I hope it's written with waterproof ink.
- It isn't there.
- It isn't there?
Must you mismanage everything?
I don't know where
Mr. Pollock is either.
What do you mean?
You've got to find him!
Come up here at once, and bring that butler of hers!
What are you doing?
- This is no time for dessert.
- Well, they're good.
- Here, have one.
- Come on. Come on.
- He is not on the ground floor, sir.
- You searched every room?
Every room, sir.
Sloane, Pollock was in your charge.
I trusted you.
- Now, you. What's your name?
- Hemsley, sir.
Hemsley. Yes, of course.
- What have you been up to, Hemsley?
- N-Nothing, sir.
Have you been disobeying my orders?
I-I work for Miss Azir, sir.
So you do.
I appreciate loyalty, Hemsley.
Tell me, how would you like to work for me?
I'm satisfied with my present position, thank you.
Are you?
Please tell me when you're dissatisfied with it, Hemsley.
Welcome aboard, Hemsley.
Thank you, sir.
Don't worry, Hemsley. Here's a bonus.
Oh. Well, thank you, sir.
Don't mention it, Hemsley.
Would you like another bonus?
Oh, not just now, sir, if you don't mind, sir.
- Where's Mr. Pollock?
- He came up here, sir.
Up here?
- Where up here?
- To this room, sir.
No hanky-panky, Mr. Beshraavi.
From man or bird.
Believe him, Nejim. He means it.
He said he'd kill me.
Close the door, lady.
Lock it.
Get him, Mustafa.
But carefully.
Whatever he does to Miss Azir,
I will do to you, personally.
Don't think that I haven't enjoyed it.
It's been a nice change.
- Thanks a lot. Bye now.
- No, they won't shoot if I'm with you.
You still need me.
Need you?
Lady, I can't live without you.
Messy business. My apologies, miss.
I'm sorry you had to see it.
Was I glad to see you?
- Are you with the police?
- Inspector Webster, CID.
How in the world did you know?
We've been watching the house.
Nasty customers.
My house?
Yes, miss. Since
Mr. Beshraavi's been staying with you.
Might I suggest we move along?
We'll have to get down to the station.
All right, all right. Who's the ruddy nit who's broke my tank downstairs?
- I'm up to me neck in drowning fishes.
- There's been some trouble.
Oh, and who are you?
The ruddy Sheriff of Sherwood Forest?
Webster, CID.
Oh. Oh, I see.
You better let me see your card.
I've got to make a report.
Somebody's got to pay for them fish.
Yes, of course.
All right, let's go.
I don't get it. Whose side are you on?
What difference does it make?
Let's get out of here.
You're not with the authorities, and you're not with Beshraavi.
And you can't be with Prime Minister Jena.
Who are you with?
Her.
Swell.
Ain't it a gas about my promotion?
Number three to General Ali himself.
He's coming round, waking up.
So you're with us again, teach.
I don't know whether I am or not.
Whose side are you on?
Don't worry about sides, daddy-o.
Yussef Kasim is the name.
Kyle Webster you've met.
And dear Miss Azir.
For a poor, subjugated Arab lady, you lead one hell of an emancipated life.
Mr. Beshraavi on the one hand, and Mr. Yussef Kasim on the other.
Do you get Sundays off?
Skip the college talk, teach.
To the point, daddy-o:
Where is the cipher?
- The cipher?
- Yeah, the cipher.
We know you've got it. No point fooling.
You're in the middle of nowhere.
The Marines can't save you for democracy here.
That cipher, where is it?
- Ask me later, alligator.
- Where is it?
I left it at Beshraavi's.
After all, it belongs to him.
Wrong again, teach. He snatched it.
It belongs to this cat right here.
Where is it?
Miss Azir, after all we've been through together, couldn't you find it in your heart to put in a small word on my behalf?
He told me he had it in his pocket.
Tattletale.
- Where is it?
- Cool it, Webster!
There's a better way.
Nice business associates you have,
Miss Azir.
Why don't you tell them where it is?
Because I don't know where it is.
- You told me you had it.
- You told me lots of things too.
Looks like we're just a pair of pathological liars.
I was honest about one thing.
I told you to keep out of this, didn't I?
- That you did.
- Then why didn't you listen to me?
Because I'm such a big know-it-all.
OK, teach, here's your chance to be a big "tell-it-all."
Somehow I get the idea you've seen too much television.
Webster.
Hey, Miss Azir, come on down here and I'll scrub your back.
Professor, can you hear me?
An earnest professor of math studied figures while taking a bath.
Professor, what did you do with the cipher?
Cipher, cipher, who's got the cipher?
- Number nine's got the cipher.
- "Nine"? What's that mean?
That's for me to know and you to guess.
Where is it?
That tickles.
Professor, you can tell me.
Where is the cipher?
Candy, I call my sugar Candy...
This is beginning to bug me.
Let's get rid of him.
- What are you going to do?
- Dump him.
- You heard him. He doesn't have it.
- Then who does?
That's what you're going to find out, sweet mama, as soon as you scoot on home and ask your rich sugar daddy. Webster.
Olé! Olé!
Olé!
Olé! Olé! Olé!
- We were quite worried about you.
- Were you, Hemsley? How sweet.
But I expected to see you wearing a burnous by now.
I'm sorry, miss.
Don't sulk, Hemsley. I'm in no position to throw the first stone.
Allah be praised, miss.
Yasmin, there you are.
I'm so delighted that you've decided to come back.
Your concern is so comforting, Nejim.
Your shower must have been quite stimulating.
It was.
But how do you suppose he happened to be in there, my pet?
I neglected to ask him.
All I know is he was waiting for me with those scissors when I stepped in.
I wonder what made him come up here in the first place?
I don't suppose it could have been your promise to keep him a prisoner here until he'd finished his work.
Oh, dear, I hope not.
I thought I was being so hospitable.
Westerners so often misunderstand us, don't you find?
Oh, I am exhausted.
Of course you are, my poor darling.
Let me give you a massage.
How can you continue being so good to me when I'm such a trial?
Oh, look at your poor shoes.
You must have done so much running.
What do you suppose happened to Mustafa?
- He hasn't come back yet.
- Dead, I'm afraid.
And servants so hard to come by these days.
I saw several possible replacements at the zoo.
My admiration for Mr. Pollock increases.
Probably Mustafa didn't feel like dying.
Mr. Pollock didn't do it, darling.
Don't stop. It feels divine.
It was Yussef Kasim.
The guerrilla forces.
I was wondering what they were up to.
I must say, they were a little miffed at you for borrowing their cipher.
I really don't think they had a chance to see it themselves.
Roll over, my love.
Do you think you can find the energy to tell me what they did to our professor?
Killed him too, I'm afraid.
That's heaven.
- So Yussef has the cipher now?
- What makes you think that?
Surely they were able to make poor Mr. Pollock relinquish it.
Mr. Pollock swore he didn't have it.
Mr. Pollock was lying.
Then I'm afraid he took the truth with him to his grave.
Before you came home I received word that Mr. Pollock had arrived safely at his rooms at Oxford.
A hardy race, the Americans.
I was also told that he was riding a bicycle and singing a very strange song.
A hardy and fun-loving race.
But tell me, my flower,
I don't think you've explained yet how it happens that Yussef managed to leave you alive.
It's very simple, really.
I promised I'd work with him.
- By spying on me, you mean?
- Of course.
- How very amusing.
- Isn't it?
- Marvelous, in fact.
- I knew you'd enjoy it.
- Darling?
- Yes, precious?
- You are hurting my shoulders.
- Am I? Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Better?
- Much.
You must have been very convincing.
It's a feminine talent.
Well, what a waste not to exploit it.
I was going to send Sloane to see Mr. Pollock to convince him to return the cipher.
But Sloane has so few subtle qualities.
I'm sure the professor would much rather deal with you.
I thought you were jealous of the professor.
I'm too busy now being jealous of Yussef.
- Hello.
- Mr. Pollock.
One moment, please, for the Prime Minister.
Mr. Pollock.
Good morning, sir.
We've been trying to contact you, Mr.
Pollock. We were very worried about you.
No more than I was, sir.
- Did you get the information?
- No, sir.
- But you do have the cipher?
- No, sir.
Do you know who does?
- I think so, sir.
- Will you be getting it then?
- No, sir.
- Why is that, Mr. Pollock?
- No guts, sir.
- I beg your pardon?
As long as you needed someone to sit down and work, I was your man.
But the situation has changed somewhat.
What you need now is someone with a Ph.D in roughhouse.
I did warn you that it might become dangerous.
Well, dangerous, sir, not lethal.
Yes. Yes, you are quite right.
I apologize, Mr. Pollock.
When one is willing to die for national honor, it is hard to remember that other people have equally important values to live for.
There is no reason why you, an outsider, should risk such a sacrifice for another man's country.
You... You take unfair advantage,
Mr. Prime Minister.
How so?
By appealing to a man's better instincts.
- I was confident that you had them.
- Well... very well, sir.
Where would you like me to be... murdered this time?
Try and find the inscription if you can.
Decipher it, and call me the moment you have.
- Time is getting very short and...
- David. David.
Thank God you're all right.
This isn't your house.
This is my house, and you weren't invited. So go away.
I didn't even know you were alive, but I came to warn you anyway.
About what?
Nejim's men are on their way here to get the cipher back.
- You've got to get away.
- Now slow down a minute.
Aren't you the same Miss Azir who just stood there while your friends tried to kill me?
Oh, David!
You don't think I enjoyed that?
- Well, so long as you didn't enjoy it.
- There was nothing I could do.
You've got to listen to me!
Every time I listen to you, someone either hits me over the head or tries to vaccinate me.
Maybe it's time that I called the police.
You mustn't do that.
What do you suggest then, the Salvation Army?
- Come with me, before it's too late.
- What?
And wind up back in Yussef Kasim's rumble seat? No, thank you.
Tell your boyfriend I'm a bad sport.
If I'd let him kill me,
I'd never have forgiven myself.
Yussef is not my boyfriend.
I loathe him.
Of course you do.
You just do what he tells you because he's holding your family hostage back in the old country.
- How did you know that?
- Oh, come on.
I've seen that movie.
General Ali Ben Ali, the man he works for, threatened to kill my mother and sisters unless I cooperated with him.
And Beshraavi, who's he got, your Uncle Max from Newark?
- What do you mean?
- Forget it.
If you want to live with Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, that's your business.
Do you think I like being near that degenerate?
I have to. Don't you understand?
Yussef ordered me to meet him and to cultivate his friendship, so I could report on his actions.
Anyway, the pay is good.
It's not the money.
I swear it. It's my family.
Oh, look, everyone's got problems, including me, so I'd just as soon not get mixed up in yours.
But you are mixed up in them, whether you like it or not.
Beshraavi wants to rule our country with his money, General Ali with his guns.
Both must know what's in that inscription.
That means they need you.
David, you must believe that I hate them both, that I'm only doing what they want because I have to.
If you can translate the inscription and we can get it to my embassy, we'll both be safe.
Yeah, well,
It sounds reasonable, I guess.
Then... you believe me?
In this cynical old world, you have to believe in something.
So, it might as well be you.
- OK, I'll buy it.
- Thank you.
Take it easy.
I'm not quite myself this morning.
You're wonderful.
Yeah, if I could find my head,
I'd go get it examined.
If we're going to have visitors, we better get out of here.
Want to give it to me now?
- Give what to you?
- The inscription.
- I don't have it.
- Well, who does?
- You do.
- Me? No, no.
You've forgotten, Yussef took it from me in the van last night.
But he couldn't find it.
Yeah, he found it.
He just didn't know that he'd found it.
Maybe we can still get it back... with a little help from you.
Where's Yussef?
It's all right. He's down there.
OK, where is it?
Over there, I think. Come on.
Must have had pups during the night.
I'll know it when I see it.
He dented it last week.
How? Knocking down an old lady at a crossing?
There it is.
Hey, hey.
- It's still there.
- I don't see anything.
The candy! You are brilliant!
The result of a clean mind and a healthy body.
Yussef.
I've checked all the morning papers.
There's not a word.
- Do you think he's still alive?
- Stop bugging me. How would I know?
Have you heard from the girl?
She'll give me a blast when she knows something.
Oh, no, he's taking it.
Why couldn't he be on a diet?
What do you know?
- Thirty-five. Which one is it?
- Number nine.
- You were actually telling the truth.
- What do you mean?
Yussef was here. I was here.
The cipher was here.
All you had to do was yell, but you didn't.
That absurd story about your mother and sisters must be true.
- You mean you didn't believe me?
- Not a word.
- Then why did you come with me?
- I didn't know where the van was.
Miss Azir, I humbly apologize.
I don't accept. The least you can do when I tell you something is believe it.
With your track record?
Let's go. Be ready to duck.
- Fourteen.
- I only hope his sweet tooth holds up.
We're victims of the Establishment.
Ask him to move.
It's no use.
They can't move, speak or even listen.
If they do, they're beheaded.
Oh, nonsense. He's a man, isn't he?
- Excuse me, soldier.
- He's a guardsman.
Excuse me, guardsman.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I know you're on duty, but...
There is something under your foot that belongs to us.
OK?
Please.
Pretty please.
David, make him lift his foot!
You've been learning from Nejim.
Fifty-two! You'd think after all that...
Oh, no. He's found it.
Sink, sank, sunk.
- He must be calling Yussef.
- I don't think so.
He knows Yussef's number.
Keep an eye on Webster.
Look here.
Webster sold out to Nejim.
Seems to be a popular indoor sport these days.
You're not including me, I hope.
Of course not.
We're believing you today.
- 3:30, but it doesn't say where.
- It doesn't have to.
If he's meeting Nejim at 3:30, there's only one place it can be.
In the fifth race the runners are as follows...
I must go and advise my horse.
- Are you coming, my love?
- You go, my darling.
I think I'll put some money on her.
What an excellent idea.
But only to win, of course.
It would be a grave mistake to back another horse at this late stage.
Well, if it isn't Mr. Dillingham.
By Jove, it's actually
Lady Hetherington-Cartwright.
- Don't overdo it.
- I didn't know you could.
I haven't seen Webster.
He's handing the inscription to Sloane at 3:30 by the winning post.
- Do be a dear, Mr. Dillingworth.
- Ham.
Dillingham. Tell me what you fancy for this race.
I'm putting my jolly old shirt on number nine.
Keep your eyes on the winning post.
You'll have to get it somehow.
- And then what?
- Meet at Trafalgar Square at midnight.
It's been positively smash to have bumped into you this way, old thing.
Do give my regards to your husband next visiting day.
- Ta-ta.
- Toodle-oo.
What odds did you get?
Two to one.
They're off.
It's Pollock.
Who is that?
They're turning into the stretch.
Three furlongs left to race, and it's...
That bungling idiot, Sloane.
Darling, we won!
- Hello?
- Prime Minister Jena, please.
It's very urgent. This is Mr. Pollock.
Pollock.
Mr. Pollock, what has happened?
Mr. Jena, there's been some trouble.
- A man was killed at Ascot today.
- Yes, I heard.
Have you also heard who it is they think killed him?
Mrs. Pollock's idiot son, David, that's who. I need your help.
I don't think there's anything
I can do for you right now, besides suggesting that you stay clear of the police.
Mr. Prime Minister,
I don't think I've made myself clear.
Right now I'm wanted for murder.
You're the only one who can explain what I've been doing.
But, Mr. Pollock,
I thought I'd made myself clear.
For security reasons,
I have never seen you.
I am not even in England.
Whatever the circumstances, we must disclaim any knowledge of you.
Where are you? Have you the message?
If the message is not deciphered soon, then...
Come here, my darling.
- I brought you some presents.
- How sweet.
More shoes?
But, darling, you've already given me dozens.
I couldn't resist these.
Quite a coincidence, Mr. Pollock turning up at the right place and right time.
- Don't you think so?
- I would hardly call it a coincidence.
Neither would I.
How do you account for it, my flower?
He must have been following
Yussef's man, the one who was killed.
- Do you think so?
- It's the only explanation.
You wouldn't have mentioned it, of course.
I?
Those are rather attractive, don't you think?
Exquisite.
I really must thank whoever was responsible for getting him there.
- Then you wanted him to have it?
- Certainly.
Who else is going to decipher it?
I want you to find him again,
I want you to stay with him until he finishes his work, and then I want you to bring the answers to me.
- Is that clear, my angel?
- Very clear.
I know that I can trust you to do that for me.
Unless, of course, you're growing weary of my little gifts.
Oh, and if I don't hear from you by noon tomorrow try and think of some remote corner of the world where I won't find you.
I don't think you can... but try.
Thank you, sir.
- Mrs. Ragheeb?
- Oh, but, sir...
I must speak to Mrs. Ragheeb.
Mrs. Ragheeb, I'm an associate of Professor Ragheeb at Oxford.
This is tremendously urgent.
It's about your husband's... murder.
Murder? Why do you say "murder"?
Your husband was murdered by some agent of Nejim Beshraavi.
He was killed for a Hittite inscription.
I don't know why.
- I know very little, but I know that.
- No, Amir.
Mrs. Ragheeb, I know this is a terrible time to trouble you, but I've got to know what that inscription means.
I thought, perhaps, among your husband's notes...
- A Hittite inscription, you say?
- Did he tell you anything about it?
Show it to me.
Mrs. Ragheeb...
I told him he was mad to meddle in such things.
Madness and suicide.
And now... he's in there.
But he must have told you something.
He must have mentioned where he got it, who gave it to him.
- We have to know.
- "We"? Who else?
A girl. Her family's in great danger.
Her mother and sisters,
General Ali will kill them.
- Is the girl named Yasmin Azir?
- Yes.
And she told you that her mother and her sisters are in danger?
Yes.
Yasmin has no such family, Mr. Pollock.
There is only her father.
General Ali would never harm him.
- Why not?
- Because General Ali is her father.
David, I was so worried about you.
Oh, you were?
The police think you killed Webster.
Have you seen the papers?
I don't care what they say as long as they spell my name right.
I had a hard time convincing Nejim I had nothing to do with your being at Ascot.
I'm sure that you were very convincing.
I told him you must have been following Webster,
- but I'm not sure he believed me.
- How could anyone not believe you?
He made me promise to keep you working on the cipher and to call him the moment you've broken it.
- Oh, damn.
- What's wrong?
Nejim had me followed when I left the house but I thought I'd lost them.
Now they're back again. Duck.
Oh, it's all right. We lost them.
Next time let me know so I can fasten my seat belt.
Where is the inscription? May I see it?
Why do you want to see it?
I don't know. I've never seen it.
When you've seen one, you've seen them all.
- As long as you have it.
- Well, I don't have it.
- What do you mean? Of course you have it!
- Look out!
- Would you like me to drive?
- What have you done with it?
Relax. I haven't forgotten your mother and sisters.
- I mailed it to myself.
- Oh, no.
How will you be able to work on it?
I won't have to. I know what's in it.
What does it mean? Tell me.
It said, "The... plague shall not pass until the swans... fly high in the kingdom of Vesta."
- Vesta? What does that mean?
- How should I know?
My job was to translate it into English.
Well, I suppose it will mean something to somebody.
I'll call the embassy and tell them, but I'd better drop you off first.
- Where are you staying?
- Right here with you.
It's not safe for you to be out on the streets. What if the police stop us?
The way you drive?
Why should they stop us?
All right, David.
I'll look for a phone box.
No, no, I'll look. That way maybe we can keep from hitting it.
- Want me to come with you?
- What for?
- Think how cozy it would be.
- But so hard to dial.
Don't tell me that the ambassador spoke with you at this hour?
As a matter of fact, he did.
They are preparing for Mr. Jena's visit tomorrow.
What did he say?
He didn't understand the message.
He said to come right over.
Er... it's all right. You can get out here. I'll meet you later.
- Why?
- Stop asking so many questions.
There are police at the embassy.
They'll recognize you.
Do you want to be arrested for murder?
All right. I'll meet you in Knightsbridge at the Kelly Hotel.
I'm registered in the name of O'Malley.
- O'Malley?
- There's a discount if you're Irish.
Follow that car.
All my life
I've waited for somebody to say that.
Thanks, guv. I enjoyed that.
Yussef?
Yasmin! Get down!
- David, you followed me.
- No, I didn't.
You went to the embassy and I came here to my hotel.
There. Over the wall.
Wait!
Down here.
Can't say I care much for your embassy.
David, I wasn't deceiving you. I had to find out what the message means.
Yussef is the only one who knows.
That's why I came here.
Not one of your brighter ideas.
- You stay here.
- David!
Oh, David! Oh, David!
I couldn't let you die without hearing the end of your story.
Come on!
But it's true. Everything. I swear it.
As true as your poor old mother and your three sisters?
- Of course.
- I went to Mrs. Ragheeb.
- Oh, no.
- She was very well-informed about you.
You told her you and I were working together?
- Naturally.
- No wonder.
No wonder what?
She'd say anything to keep you from trusting me.
She's an agent of Yussef's, like her husband. Don't you see what you did?
The moment you let her know
I was double-crossing them, she called Yussef to warn him.
So he lured me to the construction site, to kill me!
What is there about you that makes you so hard to believe?
Perhaps it's because
I'm such a terrible liar.
But never with you, of course.
I wish I could say the same.
"The plague shall not pass until the swans fly high in the kingdom of Vesta."
You made it up?
- What's the real message?
- I haven't worked it out yet.
We'll have to do something.
I packed a suitcase. It's in the back.
I can't very well go back to my house.
Nejim isn't the understanding type.
Haven't you any ideas?
Yeah.
Darling?
I got the message.
Yasmin!
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning, my darling.
You pass bachelor's requirement number one. You're lovely in the morning.
I was dreaming of someone much more romantic. You.
No, come back here.
I have something else.
I've cracked the cipher.
David, that's wonderful.
What does it mean?
It's a phony, 100 per cent phony.
It isn't Hittite. It's an ordinary, common-or-garden grade-school code.
- Look. Here, you want these?
- No, certainly not.
You see, bird sign, bird sign, bird sign.
Sex differentiation factor.
You mean it's dirty?
No, a three-year-old child could understand.
Female bird: goose.
Female bird: goose. Male bird: gander.
"Whither do you wender..."
- No, that's "wander".
- Wander.
- "Upstairs, downstairs..."
- "Or in my lady's chamber."
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.
We've got Beshraavi, the British constabulary, the whole human race howling after our blood just for a lousy nursery rhyme.
- It's got to mean something.
- It must.
- Who wrote it in the first place?
- Ragheeb, I imagine.
Exactly. Ragheeb.
"Upstairs, downstairs... in my lady's chamber."
Mrs. Ragheeb must have the answer.
She couldn't have.
She would have told Yussef.
That's right too.
When I showed her a copy of it, she tore it up.
She looked at it, and she didn't give a damn.
- Wow!
- David... what are you talking about?
A copy of the message means nothing, the translation means nothing.
The message is a screen. It's a doodle.
All that matters is the original piece of paper.
- The original?
- Of course. It isn't the cipher.
It's something else on that paper.
Something underneath the cipher.
Arise, arise, oh, my beloved.
To the Hammersmith Post Office.
Have you got it?
Don't you trust me with anything?
No watermark.
- What do you see?
- Gander, goosy, goosy.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
It must be here someplace.
Are you burning it?
That's how you detect invisible ink.
- Weren't you ever in the Boy Scouts?
- I flunked the physical.
You should have tried my troop.
We'd have waived it.
Wait, wait! Stop the car!
- What are you doing?
- I'm about to invent the wheel.
Well, there it goes.
- No, no, wait. Look!
- I don't see anything.
The eye. The eye of the third bird.
What's that?
A microdot.
- What do you see?
- Take a look.
- She's a beauty, isn't she?
- She certainly is.
But the microscope's a trifle small.
Haven't you anything larger?
Certainly, sir.
So that's what they wanted Yussef to know.
Something on this order, sir?
I'm afraid not.
Haven't you anything larger?
I'll look, sir.
What do we do now?
It says when, but it doesn't say where.
When is the 18th?
Monday was the 14th.
Tuesday, Wednesday...
- It's today.
- Today?
Come on!
This is the largest we have, sir.
Shall I...
Hey, David, look!
- Oh, no! Do something!
- Lift it out of the way?
I don't care. Do anything!
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Jena will be happy to answer your questions now.
All right, mate.
Lots of room. That's it.
Keep on going.
Lots of leeway back there.
Bring her on back, mate.
OK, fine. Plenty of leeway.
Plenty of leeway. Lots of room.
Right on back. Good.
Right on back, mate. Right on back.
Fine, fine. Good. Plenty of room, mate.
That's good.
Thanks, mate.
This is your first visit to England.
What are your first impressions?
We could use some of your
English rain in our dry country.
In our country, there's a great deal of oil and very little water.
A highly inflammable situation.
All right, Hemsley.
Water remains our most serious problem.
To paraphrase Marie Antoinette:
I can hardly say of my people,
"Let them drink oil."
May I see your press card, please, sir?
Diners Club?
I'm afraid I don't recognize you.
We're doing a piece on the Arabic cuisine.
- I'm sorry, sir. It's not on my list.
- Get out of the way.
I'm sorry, sir.
Would you comment on the treaty you intend signing?
You've been misinformed, sir.
I shall not sign the treaty.
- Listen!
- Let us through!
- He's about to be killed!
- I hardly think so, this is England.
I have studied the terms of the treaty most carefully, and I could not, in good conscience...
They have fought too long and hard...
Please! Let us through, please!
What is happening?
- Mr. Pollock?
- I'm sorry, sir. Are you all right?
It appears that I am. What happened?
I was a little late deciphering the message. That's what.
- Here. Let me help you up.
- Thank you.
Mr. Pollock was brilliant.
He deserves a medal.
Who is responsible for this?
Do you know?
Yes, sir. Nejim Beshraavi.
Beshr...
Mr. Pollock, I must speak with you.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Come,
Mr. Prime Minister. The car is waiting.
- I must speak with Mr. Pollock.
- There's no time.
We don't know who else here might be involved.
I must speak to Mr. Pollock!
Come on.
They did it. After all that, they did it. We just stood there.
- Where are we going?
- We have to find Jena.
- Did I understand you to say...
- That wasn't Jena.
- It sounded like you said...
- I tell you, it wasn't!
It looked very much like him, but it wasn't Jena.
It was Hassan Jena. I know him.
- Oh!
- He knows me.
I've spoken to him many times.
He came to Oxford.
Jena's never set foot in England before today.
He wanted people to think that.
He was here.
He's the one who sent me to Beshraavi in the first place.
That man? The one who was shot?
Yes. Now do you believe me?
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I never knew who you were.
That's why he looked so frightened.
Nejim hired him to impersonate Jena, only he neglected to mention that part of his job was to be murdered.
We have to find the real Jena. Come on.
You expect me to believe that nonsense?
- What proof do you have?
- He didn't recognize me.
But... Wait...
Why should he recognize you?
Yasmin, are you trying to tell me something?
I am a spy.
Hey. Wait!
- Can you prove that statement?
- Do you think we carry calling cards?
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- You wouldn't have believed me.
- Where are we going?
- I want to see where it happened.
Where what happened?
Did you record the Prime Minister's arrival on tape?
- Yes.
- Run it for me.
The Prime Minister's life may depend on it.
- You're a bit late. He's been shot.
- Do as I say.
- Is that tape ready to roll yet?
- It's all set.
Put it up on the monitors.
- Which one is that?
- The real one. It has to be.
There was no way to get to him before this.
Yes, it's Jena.
Those are his favorite slippers.
Can you see what's happening inside the car?
The windows are too dark.
Hold that. Can you freeze it?
Look, the shoes are different.
He's not wearing slippers anymore.
That's where it happened. In the car.
We've got to find it.
She's a government spy.
Look.
Come on.
Give me a hand, will you?
You seriously think...
What else would they have done?
Left him in the airport?
It's the treaty, isn't it?
If it had gone through,
Nejim would have been ruined.
- Jena was going to sign it?
- That's why they needed a substitute.
To denounce the treaty before the assassination.
I have a vivid imagination.
I must say, I never saw myself unpacking a prime minister.
Our life expectancy may be nil, but I'd like you to know this has been a very real, warm, human experience.
It's uncanny.
What is it? Where am...
You're among friends, sir.
At least for the next 30 seconds.
- Are you all right?
- I think so.
- Is that you, Miss Azir?
- Let's get him out.
Ploy number one.
We've got him, sir.
It's about time you did something right.
Well, get him out!
Hey, you two! Lend a hand here. And you!
Undo these chains.
Put it down! Open it, Sloane.
Imbecile. Must you mismanage everything?
Down! Flat! Now!
Come on! Run for it!
Wait!
- Can you ride, Mr. Prime Minister?
- You ask that of an Arab?
- What do you want?
- We, er... er...
You can't ride in that skirt.
Hup!
- Are you all right, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
That way!
I don't see what he can do now.
He'll think of something.
I knew you couldn't keep a good man down.
There!
Get them, Sloane! This time get them!
David!
- Are you all right?
- No. I'm ashamed of myself.
- I ride better than that.
- Come on!
This side!
Those stairs must lead somewhere.
Are you sure?
If they don't, watch out for the last one.
Here comes old Eagle-Eye.
This is like a recurring dream I used to have.
- How did it end?
- Don't ask.
Here goes.
Don't, David. Please, don't.
You'll be a sitting duck.
How come my recurring dream never ended this way?
I don't know. Mine always did.
I guess I just travel in better dreams.
Do I have your... solemn pledge that you'll never spy again?
- Only on you.
- Oh, swell.
Hey!
You clumsy idiot!
Oh, it's you, Mr. Pollock.
Oh, hello, Fanshaw.
David... you can swim, can't you?
Sorry. Not a stroke.
David!
Here we are again, taking a bath together.
David, you lied to me!
Sure. It was my turn.
Help!
Get us out of here!
Help!
Help! Get us out of here!
We're trapped.
(screams)
Somebody get us out! Help!
(splintering)
What happened?
- She's hit something.
- Have mercy.
I can't get it open. It's jammed.
You first, Fritz.
(grunts)
Ernst, help your mother.
Captain Wilhelm? Anybody here?
Anyone there, Fritz?
If anybody was here, they'd have heard us long before this.
As I said, if they've abandoned the ship, they've got no claim.
It's ours, by maritime law.
They wouldn't leave us here.
Something must have happened.
They thought the ship was going to sink. It was every man for himself.
It was carrying too much sail. The captain and the mate argued about it.
I'd have fought the pirates instead of running into the storm.
Alright, Mother.
What a mess!
- At least we're not far from land.
- Then there's hope.
Maybe when we get to shore we can get help. Make her sail again.
She'll never sail again.
We could build a raft.
We've got enough wood.
Fritz is right.
The sooner we get ashore, the better.
Look what I found!
(cow moos)
- Look.
- Those poor things!
They must have had a worse time than we did.
How's it look?
Are we solid on the rocks?
I don't know. No, I'd say we're here until the turning of the tide.
Help me, somebody! Help!
(barking)
No!
Look what I found. The captain's dogs. And are they glad to see me!
- He's alright.
- Better make a start. Come on.
Give me a hand.
If it's deserted I can work out where we are when I learn how to use this.
Alright, take it along.
(organ plays)
- It still works!
- There's no time for that.
- Let's put up a distress flag.
- We don't look distressed enough?
Anyone who sees a ship stuck on the rocks might guess it's in trouble.
Now, you look after them, Turk.
You too, Duke.
- How can we take all these animals?
- We're not taking them.
- If we leave them they'll die!
- When we're safe on land then you can talk to me about the animals. Not before.
Francis, get them out of there!
We don't want this one or that.
- Wait a minute!
- Or that. We don't want any of them.
Right, Fritz.
Put it over your head. That's it.
- Alright, I'm fine.
- Grip the rope here.
- Alright?
- Come on, Mother. We'll catch you.
- Don't worry.
- Right, Fritz.
- Come on.
- Now.
- Sorry, Mother.
- Are you alright?
(dog moans)
Fritz, the dogs!
He forgot the dogs.
They're not coming. Cast off.
They're my dogs! I found them!
Sit down. They weigh more than any of us. We'd sink in no time.
Alright, Fritz? Right.
Watch that wreckage.
(dog barks)
The dogs are going to swim it.
Come on, Duke. Come on, Turk.
You can make it. Keep swimming.
Straight between those rocks.
That side.
No, come and help me push over here.
Come on, boys, you can make it!
Keep swimming.
- Watch those rocks.
- Your side, Ernst. Push off!
Come on, Turk! Come on, Duke!
Look out!
Do something. They'll drown!
We can't take any more chances.
Look!
(barking)
Come on, boy.
(barking)
- Good boy, Turk. Well done.
- Keep them in the middle.
- That's right. In the centre.
- You see? They didn't sink us.
Let's get to shore.
I wouldn't dare pray for any more miracles, not in one day.
Turk, Duke, wait. I'm coming too.
Wait for me!
- Francis, stay in your tub.
- I'm coming!
(barking)
- Come back!
- Tie it round the tree stump.
(growling)
Come on, let's go.
Francis, come back here.
See you later.
First thing we'd better do is unload the raft. Then...
...put up some sort of shelter for the night.
Not the first thing.
Fritz. No, hold it, Fritz.
- We are not making any progress.
- I know.
It's got to hang down even on both sides.
- Aren't very good.
- We're lucky to have them.
- Pull your side down.
- Right, I've got my side.
Hold it down, Fritz.
Come on.
You're very lucky to have them.
(growls)
I think tomorrow, if the ship's still there, you and I, and maybe Ernst, ought to try and bring in the animals and anything else we might need.
- How long will we have to stay here?
- I don't know. I just...
I just think we ought to do everything we can.
(screams)
(click)
What's going on?
Powder was wet.
(thunder)
(screeching hooting)
Aren't you coming to bed?
You have to have some sleep.
- Besides, it's going to rain.
- No, I'm alright.
No-one can go back and undo what's already done but...
Well, I... want you to know that...
...l'm sorry things didn't work out the way I wanted them to.
I know.
It would have been better if we'd just stayed in Bern.
I'm not so sure. Not with Napoleon trying to grab up more and more.
Fritz and Ernst might both be in a war. Maybe even you.
No. Better to stay and face things rather than just running away.
Is it running away to try to find a new life in a new colony?
Try to give our sons a chance to live, a chance to be free?
Is that running away?
I keep thinking about all the men in those other offices along the Marktgasse. They go on working at the same old jobs and manage to find opportunities for their families, without running off to the other side of the world.
We settled all this before we left home.
It was a good thing we set out to do.
We were right. Nothing has changed just because we were shipwrecked.
You're always right, aren't you?
We'll get there. I'm sure of it.
Sooner or later there'll be a ship.
I'll pray for it with every breath I take.
It's a big land, New Guinea.
For hundreds of years there'll be new colonies, a great new world to build.
No limit to what a man can do.
If we're a couple of months late getting there, it won't matter.
We're not too badly off, are we?
We've got each other, the family,
- food to eat.
- Even a tent to keep the rain off, if we had sense enough to use it.
(thunder and rain)
Now don't worry.
Try to go back to sleep.
I'm soaked!
- Having trouble?
- I'll get it down, but it may take a while.
(pigs squeal)
Easy.
(bleating)
Wait a minute. Hold him.
Easy!
(bleating)
I keep trying to tell her it's for her own good.
A ship! There's a ship!
Ahoy! Ahoy there!
I think they've seen us.
Take a look, Fritz.
- There's something on the sail...
- I knew it.
It's the pirate ship that chased us into the storm. Get down!
And I deliberately tried to get their attention.
This time we have a weapon.
- Do you know how to fire it?
- I think so. Let's pull it back.
I'll get a keg of powder. See if you can find some rags, for wadding.
I know. I'll be right back.
(shouts in foreign language)
(whistling)
We'll only have one shot. Let's wait until we can't possibly miss.
(whistle and splash)
(canon fires)
- What's happening?
- They're going away.
Did they see us loading the cannon and get scared?
Pirates scared off by one cannon and three people?
Do you know what they're up to?
What's that?
A quarantine flag, warning there's Black Death aboard.
How did you know that?
Well, I do a bit of reading too.
Come on, Fritz.
(cow moos)
- Pull those new lines tight.
- Right.
Yes, that's it. There.
(bleating, crowing, gobbling)
(grunting)
No! What's the matter with you?
(moo)
Not that way, stupid. This way.
- Maybe it's too much for one trip.
- We had to try.
Sharks!
(anxious lowing)
- You got one!
- Watch that one coming in.
- There's another one.
- I'll get it.
- I hit it!
- Here comes another one!
Get out of here!
Got one.
Look out, Ernst, there's another.
- No, it's a turtle.
- We disturbed him with our shots.
I think we scared them away.
It's pulling us!
Better to use your head than break your back, I always say.
Francis, see if you can find the...
Where are you?
Here, Duke, Turk. Here, boys.
(barking)
Where's Francis? Go find him.
Now you wait just one minute and I'll have some sugarcane for you.
Now, come along, little fella.
I won't hurt you.
Now, just let me fix this.
Here, little elephant. Come here.
That's right.
Come on, little elephant.
I wouldn't hurt you.
Come on, little fella.
I wouldn't hurt you.
I have some nice fresh sugarcane for you.
Come on.
(trumpets)
Come on. Just a little closer.
That's right.
Come on, little fella.
(Mother) Francis, where are you?
Now you just put your foot... right there.
Come on, little elephant.
A little closer.
Just a little bit closer.
Right...
Now stop pulling!
(growls)
(trumpets)
What's the matter?
- (trumpeting)
- (Mother) Francis.
(growls)
You get out of here!
(trumpets)
Francis
Francis, where are you?
You get away from my elephant.
Get out. He's my elephant.
(barking)
(growling and roaring)
(barking)
Duke, Turk, come on!
You bit him enough.
Good old Duke.
Did I tell you you could leave the beach?
You might have been eaten, wandering off that way!
What do you have to say for yourself?
- I'm sorry but...
- But what?
Can I keep the baby elephant, anyhow?
Now I'll keep you.
Come on, Rocky, get going.
Alright, Francis, hold it.
Slack off a bit.
Come on, Rocky, back up.
Good little fella, back up.
- Right.
- Hold it.
- That was a good idea, Ernst.
- Thanks, Fritz.
Come on.
Fritz, no more full planks, just some odds and ends.
I think we've got enough.
Well? What do you think of it?
I'd like it a lot better if I knew tigers couldn't climb trees.
They won't climb this one.
You probably won't have seen such a house.
I'm sure of that.
The world is full of nice, ordinary little people who live in nice, ordinary little houses on the ground.
But didn't you ever dream of having a tree house?
No. Mostly I dream of having a house in New Guinea.
You think we're going to be here for a long time.
This I have no way of knowing but we can't sit on the beach just waiting for a ship.
- But there could be a ship?
- Of course.
Then I think we ought to try to light the signal fire.
And just forget about the pirates?
Maybe they won't come back.
Maybe we could get away with it.
We can't chance it. Being alive is more important than being found.
- Don't look down.
- Alright, Mother. I've got you.
- What do you think?
- Fritz, can I sleep with you?
- What an idea!
- It's not built for two.
- But I'll give you a swing.
- Be careful. Take this rope.
Tie it around his waist.
Mother?
(Frances squeals)
- Getting on, aren't we?
- Yes.
Here, I want to show you something.
(Frances) Faster.
(gasps)
Look. This is our room.
You won't to get me to go up there,
- not without some sort of railing.
- It'll be like a house, enclosed.
This is your own circular stairway.
Let's go back down before someone falls off the edge.
- Come on, Francis.
- He'll be alright. I'll go first.
(chattering)
Come on, little fella. I wouldn't hurt you. I just want to pet you.
Come on.
- Frances.
- (shouts)
- Hold him, Ernst.
- I've got him.
- He caught it.
- Are you alright?
Yes. He's my new pet.
Don't let him go.
- Feel his heart beating!
- Mine could match his beat for beat!
Supposing I hadn't insisted that he had this rope tied around his waist?
Until you get a railing put up,
I don't want Francis back up here.
And I assure you
I won't be up here either!
I'm sorry, dear.
I don't blame you for being upset.
But you don't seem to understand what we have in mind.
No, but won't you trust us?
Do what you like, just see Francis is on the ground.
I assure you I won't be back up here.
Alright, we'll do that.
You stay back in camp and when we've got everything as we want it, then we'll bring you back, see how you feel.
(chatters)
Don't you think you can talk to me like that.
- How much further?
- Hurry! You'll love the new house.
This way, Mother. Wait till you see what we've done.
There's all sorts of things inside.
You just wait.
- We must be there now.
- Take off the blindfold.
Just a moment, please.
Old Swiss custom.
Carry the bride across the threshold.
Father!
Duke, Turk, get out of my way.
(bell tolls)
How's this?
All the latest innovations.
Running water.
Genuine imported tortoiseshell.
And not forgetting the cooler.
This is Ernst's contribution.
He invented it.
He and Fritz built it.
See how it works, Mother? Look.
Big wheel turns the little wheel up there, the cup pours the water into the shell, it runs down the bamboo and feeds the sink and the cooler.
I... can't believe it.
Darling, thank you.
I'm second. I go after Mother.
- Thank you.
- Up you go.
(parrot squawks)
Up there's the boys' room.
And look.
This is something I worked out. When in for the night, turn the wheel, pull up the stairs.
Keeps out wild animals and neighbours who may become a nuisance, always wanting to borrow something.
We'll be troubled so much by them!
Get me down!
Whoah.
Remember this? I built it for us.
Don't tell me, you pull this to ring for the butler.
Here, I'll show you.
You can lie and look at the stars.
Don't you remember?
That summer we went to Interlaken.
You said that some day, if you could have your wish, you'd sleep each night so you could see the stars.
What is it? What's wrong?
These curtains don't belong here.
They're from the Captain's cabin. We thought you'd like them.
It's so wonderful. I don't deserve it. I can't believe it.
Don't worry about the curtains.
If you don't like them, I know a woman who can fix anything.
(Mother sings)
# ... was an island on a stormy sea
# Till my golden ship of dreams
came to me
(hums)
# ... filled with the wondrous dreams
# that love brings to light
# so when you're old...
Here it is. Tiger.
"Panthera tigris, a native of Asia, ranges north to Siberia and south to India and the Malay Peninsula."
Only with a land bridge could there be so many different animals on one island.
How do you know it's an island?
Why couldn't it be a peninsula?
Well, why don't you let us try and sail around it?
You know how your mother feels about that.
I think there used to be a land bridge between here and Asia.
This is all that's left.
That's why so many different types of animals are trapped here.
What do you think, Fritz?
Do you agree?
I suppose there could have been one, a long time ago.
There's only one way to find out.
Ask Mother again.
Maybe she'll change her mind.
Mother wants to get to New Guinea too. There might be a village or some place where ships come in.
If the occasion presents itself, I might bring it up again. What's this?
A spelling competition?
"Tiger, bear, elephant."
That's a list of animals we've identified so far.
"Hyena, monkey, lizard."
(squawking and barking)
Ostrich.
Help!
- Francis, let go!
- I can't let go
- or he'll get away.
- Let him go anyway. We'll catch him.
Frances.
- Are you alright?
- Yes, I'm alright.
Are you alright?
Not a mark on him that won't wash off!
- Grab his neck.
- We can learn to ride him.
Let me try. Help me out.
We'd better get him trained a bit first.
- Let me try it, then.
- Alright.
I get to try next.
I got it.
You silly...
(whoops)
Here I go.
Look out for that rock.
No, you gotta keep swinging.
Everybody, follow the leader.
Come on, I'll race you down.
Mother, look at me.
- Go on, Father. You can do it.
- Of course I can.
Whaa!
Here I come.
- Where are we going?
- Wait and see.
Come on.
(chattering)
Look at the monkeys. Look.
- What?
- Look at them swinging.
- Look at that.
- I can do that.
- Let's see you try.
- Anyone can change hands.
- Now, steady.
- Go on.
My turn next.
- No, my turn.
- After me.
Are you alright?
Never better. See what I mean?
- You really are very graceful.
- Thank you very much.
Isn't this the kind of life we were meant to live on this earth?
Everything we need. Everything's right here, right at our fingertips.
You know, if only people could have all this and be satisfied,
- the world wouldn't have problems.
- Or any future generations.
There isn't everything we need right at our fingertips.
- Now what are you talking about?
- This.
It's wonderful for today, but what about tomorrow? And our sons?
- What future is there here for them?
- Tomorrow can take care of itself.
Suppose we never got away?
They'd never know what it was like to be married.
Yes. Yes, that's right.
Now you come to mention it, there aren't many girls around here.
It's nothing to joke about.
Suppose they never have a chance to know what it's like to have a family?
What you're trying to say is we ought to make every effort to get away?
- Exactly.
- Right.
Then I'll tell the boys they can sail around the coast,
- see what they can find.
- That's not what I said!
Sooner or later we'll have to face it.
But what do they know about sailing and outrigging and...
- Do you think it's safe?
- We can't hold on to them forever.
Come on, Rocky, you can pull it faster.
Come on, pull.
Fritz, grab hold. That's it.
We'll be back soon and maybe we'll find a ship to take us away.
Don't worry, Mother.
Be careful, Fritz.
Get Rocky clear.
Back up.
Well...
It's going to be up to you,
Fritz. If you run into a storm or trouble of any kind, I'm relying on your judgement, your good sense.
Make sure you both get safely back.
Goodbye, Ernst.
- Goodbye. Don't worry.
- Remember to use your head.
(whoops)
(trumpets)
Good luck.
Don't worry.
They'll be back before you know it.
I hope we are doing the right thing.
Letting them go.
I'm sure we are.
If we'd let them go sooner we might be in New Guinea by this time.
- Bye! Bring me back a crocodile!
- Goodbye!
Goodbye.
I wish Mother could see this place. She'd love it.
You know what I'd like? I'd like to see some real mountains once again.
Walk the Oberland.
Stand looking up at the Jungfrau when a storm moves in.
Remember how you could smell the snow in the air?
Do you ever think about what you'd be doing if you'd stayed in Bern?
Sometimes.
I think about Herr Kobel, what he said, that I should attend the Academy.
- Fine chance you would have had.
- It might have worked out.
I tell you where
I'd really like to be.
Walking down the Nydeggasse, like on a Sunday after church.
All the girls stroll past all dressed up.
- Anyone in particular?
- No, nobody special.
Maybe you don't know them or speak to them, but you look and they look and you just know they're there.
Fritz, if we ever get to New Guinea, will there be any girls our age?
By the time we get to New Guinea we won't care what age they are!
Ernst, get the sail down. Quick!
- Keep down.
- What's the matter?
- What happened?
- Quick, give me the glass.
There's something moving over there on the beach.
Pirates.
I'm sure it's the same one we scared off with the quarantine flag.
Let's sneak in closer. If we stay behind the rocks they won't see us.
- Ernst, bring the bow round.
- I'm trying.
(shouting)
That chest they've opened was my
First Officer's, God rest his soul.
I wish they'd fight and kill each other.
You let me do any talking.
No! Leave him! Put him down!
Kuala, listen to me!
Little boy, you all alone.
He is 14 years.
Leave him alone.
Leave the boy alone! Kuala, wait!
You will want me to write a ransom note. I write.
My people send money if you let me go.
You send plenty money, then you go.
No, wait!
Leave the boy with me or I not write ransom note.
No boy, no note.
I'm sorry, Bertie, to have got you into this.
We'll... get out of this somehow.
Now keep as still as you can.
You'll only make things worse.
Now they'll decide which crew is going to take us.
We could sneak in and free the old man and the boy before the others knew what was happening.
Alright.
It's now or never. Come on.
At least I think they'll keep us together.
- Shhh. Don't make any noise.
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
- We've come to help you.
- If only we had a knife.
- Quick! Don't bother with me.
Get the boy free first. Go on!
They won't harm me. I'm valuable for ransom. Get Bertie free.
Get away if you can.
If they ransom me, I'll get a ship and come back for you.
I won't leave without you.
Get away quickly.
Don't waste time on me. Go on!
- Run!
- No, I won't go!
Go on, leave me!
(gunshots)
Ow!
- Come on.
- I can't go on another step.
(shouting)
In here.
Shhh!
Pirates took your ship?
What were you, cabin boy?
The old gentleman back there's your grandfather?
Come on.
And who are you anyway?
Where did you come from?
- We were shipwrecked. Our ship...
- (yell)
Ernst.
Run.
Come on.
They're leaving.
They're going away.
Could be a trick, so we come back, like the Greeks and the Trojan horse.
I think we'll stay here until daylight.
Probably save time cutting across the island instead of going around the beach.
No question about it now, this is an island.
What about me?
What am I going to do?
I guess you'll come with us.
Right about that direction should take us home.
But if they release my grandfather he'll come back here to look for me.
Don't worry. He knows you're with us.
If we're not here, he'll just sail around the island.
He couldn't get a ship past our place unseen, even if he wanted to.
- Bertie, you can have the middle.
- Come on.
I'll just sit up. Not sleepy.
(chattering)
Fritz.
Do you imagine we've changed a lot since we first landed?
- In what way?
- Lots. Like getting stronger,
- more sure of ourselves.
- I suppose so.
When we first came here, everything scared us.
- All those strange noises.
- How could I forget?
We must have been pretty helpless.
That I'd have to agree with.
Listen. You don't think we were something like him?
I don't think so.
Did you get a good look at his hands?
I bet he's never done anything.
A wealthy family, an only child.
- Sometime, look at the way he walks.
- I did!
And back home, we used to call
Jean Monteau a sissy.
Remember we were wishing we could see some girls?
We're so close to getting our wish but we've still missed it completely!
That direction. That's the way we've got to go, Fritz.
We'll cross here. Doesn't look as though it'll be over our heads.
Do we have to cross just here?
It's easy. Take off your clothes, carry them over your head.
Better than walking in wet clothes.
Just until we've crossed the deep part.
- I can't swim.
- I don't think you'll have to.
Come on, get started.
I'm going back to the beach to wait for my grandfather.
- Don't come any closer!
- Are you out of your mind?
- Stay back!
- That's my gun! You can't take it!
Sorry, but I need it more than you.
My grandfather will make it alright with you.
Wait. You keep his attention.
- I'll slip round behind him.
- I'll keep his attention!
You! Bertie!
Put that down or I'll let this go.
Drop it!
Don't do that, Ernst, I'll shoot!
I don't want to shoot you.
Now put that down!
(gun fires)
Let go of me!
Stop it!
I'll teach him to shoot at me!
She didn't mean to fire.
I don't care! I could have been...
What? She didn't?!
(whimpers)
It's a girl!
Why would a girl dress up like that?
It was because of the pirates.
My grandfather made me cut my hair and dress like this because...
Because he didn't want them to know.
At least now you can wash your face.
Well, it'll be nice to be called Roberta again.
I'm sorry, but if we'd known you were a girl
- we wouldn't have...
- We'll try to make it easy for you, as much as possible.
- Careful.
- Give me your hand.
Thank you.
Careful. Watch your step, Roberta.
Thank you, Fritz.
Variations and deviations are two completely different things.
Like here, Roberta.
Variations can be compensated for mathematically.
But deviations, you never know when they're going to happen.
My grandfather will get you navigating one of his ships.
- Would you like that?
- Maybe. Someday.
I'd like to finish school first, though.
- Do you like the sea, Fritz?
- I like things you can depend on.
You can never be sure of the sea.
That's the fun of it, not being sure.
"The winds aloud howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud.
Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears and instant death on every wave appears."
Homer's Iliad. One of the most beautiful things ever written.
When we were caught in the storm I thought of those lines over and over.
Do you read a lot, Fritz?
Him? He practically doesn't even read at all.
Never needed to. Ernst always tells me everything he knows.
I think we're getting off course.
We should bear more...
...to the right.
It's alright, he won't hurt you.
It's gone. Come on.
Stay close to me.
(bird calls)
(chattering and bird calls)
(gasps)
(yells)
Get out of it, quick!
Do something!
Get the knife!
Ernst, the knife! The knife!
Hurry.
Hurry, Ernst!
- Hit the head!
- I can't find it.
Here!
Now!
I'm sorry it took so long to find it.
It was horrible.
Let's go back.
Please, let's go back.
It keeps getting worse.
And worse.
I think the worst is behind us now.
Here, give me your hand.
No! My compass has gone!
I don't know where to look.
I guess we'll have to get along without it.
Without it? We wouldn't have a chance. We need that compass.
We don't necessarily need a compass.
I think I can do as well without it.
Think? You could be wrong.
Alright, I don't think it,
I know it. And from now on, Ernst, you're just going to have to trust my judgement. Come on.
How's it feel now, Roberta?
I don't care what he says.
I can't go on day after day.
- We've got no other choice.
- We're lost and you know it.
- We're not lost.
- If you want to go on, go ahead.
Ernst and I have decided not to.
You've what?
We can find the river and follow it back to the coast.
- Anyway, it's two against one.
- Even if it were ten against one
I've got to get us back and I'm going to.
Being older doesn't make you always right.
- What are you doing?
- Taking charge of the pistol.
It was appropriated once before when somebody wanted to go back.
Give me back my pistol!
Now, watch yourself.
Stop it!
Have your pistol back.
But you only have a few shots left.
How far do you think you'd get?
There isn't any decision to make.
We've got to keep going.
I suppose we'd better go with him.
- Do you think you can?
- I'll try.
(animal cries)
(zebra cries)
Hey! Hey!
Go on, get out! Get away!
Go on. Get away.
(hyenas snarl and wail)
Get away. Go on.
You really got yourself into a mess.
Alright, I won't hurt you.
Easy, boy. Easy. I'll get you out.
If we can get him out, maybe you won't have to walk all the way.
You'll never get him out that way.
I'll get more branches, to make a path.
At a time like this you gotta use your head. Here you are.
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
# Not only green when summer's here,
but also when 'tis cold and drear
- # O Christmas tree,
- (organ squawks)
# Thy leaves are so...
Must have got wet coming over.
I don't know how you managed to get it ashore.
I couldn't have done it alone.
Fritz and Ernst helped. I...
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Are we ever gonna open up these other packages?
- Those are for Fritz and Ernst.
- But suppose they don't come back?
- Suppose they got ate up?
- Francis, it's been a long day.
- And it's past your bedtime.
- But it's Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- I'll come up and say goodnight.
Alright.
(organ)
(discord)
(whining)
(distant singing)
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
much pleasure thou can'st give me
It's Fritz and Ernst!
What have you got there?
Did you bring me back my crocodile?
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
What have you got there? We thought you got ate up or something.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
- What is it?
- A zebra.
Merry Christmas!
Ernst! Happy Christmas!
- Mother!
- Fritz! Happy Christmas!
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
A zebra.
# O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,
thy leaves are so unchanging
- I think I need that razor next.
- Let's see, Ernst.
Yes. Got it.
It's a good thing you boys have done. A very good thing.
And I'm going to try and make sure it's not wasted.
How do you mean?
The pirates know you took their prisoner and that you're on this island.
Think they're going to forget?
They didn't know she was a girl and not a cabin boy.
They wouldn't come after us.
What have we got?
- We've got their prisoner here.
- Pirates! If they come here,
I'll shoot them.
It'll take more than a crossbow.
We'll get the cannon from the ship.
It's useless.
It's rusted right over.
I should have covered it up.
Let's not waste time looking backwards.
Thank you, Father.
First thing tomorrow, we'll go out to the ship, take off everything else we might possibly need and then blow her up.
- You mean with gunpowder?
- What for?
They already know it's there.
I'm hoping that with hundreds of islands and thousands of reefs, they won't remember exactly where we are.
Father's right.
We have to blow it up.
Be ready to fight but not too proud to hide, eh?
Just a sip now.
That's enough.
It must have taken great courage to pack up and set off for a new colony and leave your whole world behind you.
With my husband and my sons, I wasn't leaving my entire world behind me.
You couldn't know what you were getting into. All the hardships.
Think of the things you might have had to do without.
Take a look.
- It's beautiful.
- I've always wanted a daughter, someone I could dress up and make clothes for.
I just didn't expect it for Christmas.
Thank you.
How about this? We get some trees, bend them down, make snares, the pirates step in the snares, trip them and they're caught.
But how can we defend this place?
I think what we need is a hill, so they have to come up to us.
- I got an idea.
- What is it, Francis?
We could dig some big pits and then we could put lions, tigers, snakes, and all sorts of animals in there.
When the pirates come, they fall in.
I don't know whether we could manage the lions and tigers, but I think a few pits might be a very good idea.
Nyah!
You look very beautiful, my dear.
Come and join the family.
Allow me, Roberta.
May I have the pleasure of the first dance?
Oh!
(country dance)
There. What did I tell you?
Anything we really need, the island will produce it. Even a girl.
A girl. But we have three sons.
Excuse me, Fritz.
I'll dance with you, Fritz.
I'll rest awhile, if you don't mind.
- What's the matter?
- I was just thinking.
We gotta have those lions and tigers or else...
Well, that's the whole idea.
I guess we'll just have to have them, then.
(monkey chatters)
Since you have a partner, Ernst,
I'm sure you won't mind.
(laughter)
It might have been simpler if I'd left the dress in the chest.
Alright, keep playing.
Thank you.
Come on, Francis.
May I have the pleasure?
(whooping)
Something must have gone wrong with the fuse.
We're not going back to find out.
We'll have to pick up every scrap of lumber. Can't leave any evidence.
Must be getting close.
(explosion)
Ka-boom!
I used to dream that somehow we'd find a way to make her sail again.
Now...
Well, we can be sure of one thing.
If the pirates do come, we're going to outnumbered.
Maybe ten to one.
But up here, if we prepare everything in advance, we'll be able to give a good account of ourselves.
We'll be like medieval knights defending the castle.
We'll keep the muskets for our final defence.
I'll give the order when to use them.
Of course, if anything should happen to me, then Fritz will take charge,
- then Ernst.
- And then me.
Yes, then you, Francis.
We've only got a small army.
We can only afford one general.
Now that's our weak point and this is where they'll try to come up.
We could have used the cannon.
We'll have to do the best we can without it.
Down there we'll put our pits and our snares and our entanglements.
We could plant some gunpowder and touch it off with fuses from the top.
Anything to hold them up.
You can rely on me, Roberta.
I've got it all worked out.
Can I take care of the lions and tigers and things?
- You're in charge of the tigers.
- Good.
I'd like to be something in the world, so I want to go to school.
You'd love it in London, anyway.
There are concerts, parties, dances.
Ladies in beautiful gowns.
Elegant men in tall hats.
- Did you ever own a tall hat?
- No.
I can't wait to see you in one.
You'll be quite handsome.
I think that's what I miss most of all, the colour and the excitement.
I know I'd especially like it... if you were there.
I'll be there. As long as I live,
I won't travel any further from home than an occasional trip to the seaside.
Thank you, Roberta.
There must be something my grandfather can do for you all.
Herr Kobel used to say,
"For some boys school is a punishment, for others a reward."
There must be something my grandfather can do.
(cow bells jangle)
Francis, don't! If you drop that you could blow us all to pieces.
Dropping it wouldn't set it off.
You'd have to light the fuse.
- Even then I'm not so sure.
- You don't think they'll work?
They'll make noise, keep the pirates confused, that's all.
Just because Papa thought of them instead of you.
What's all this?
More pirate alarms?
Yes, for the steep side.
You and your pirate alarm.
What about your tiger?
Have you caught him yet?
No. Until Fritz and Ernst dig the pits there's no place to keep him.
Ernst, Roberta.
- One of you, give me a hand!
- It's alright, I'll go.
Don't bother.
Up there.
Pull the knot as tight as you can.
Francis, put that down!
Is that alright?
Good.
There we are.
What are you doing?
He was just showing me how it will work.
I feel sorry for any pirates who come.
It was my idea. If you like I'll show you what else I had in mind.
(explosion)
Pirates. They're here! Into the fort, everybody! Come on, quick!
- What is it?
- Francis! Where is he?
You know those coconut bombs?
You don't have to worry about them.
They work right well.
Come down!
You might have been killed?
If you'd stayed put, Ernst, this wouldn't have happened.
- Don't tell me what to do!
- I just did.
- That's enough.
- I don't care.
He thinks he can just give orders.
I said that's enough.
This incident's closed.
Now let's get back to work.
I don't want to hear another word about it.
If you really don't want to go to school and your mind is made up, maybe my grandfather could give you a job. It'll be a good job, Fritz.
Perhaps in the counting house.
What if he doesn't get back here for some reason?
What if we have to stay on the island for 10 or 20 years?
He will come back, I know it.
He's probably headed this way now in one of his fastest ships.
You'd take the job if he offered it to you?
It's not that I wouldn't appreciate it, but it's just not for me.
Cooped up in an office counting somebody else's money, doing the same thing day after day.
What would you like to do?
If we get off this island I'd like to do what we started out to do.
Go on to New Guinea and become part of the new colony.
Maybe take up some land in my own name.
- Well, why?
- Why?
Well, because it's a good thing.
You've got a chance to build, with your own two hands.
It's the beginning of a new country.
That's what I like about it.
Well, I'm going to London.
Ernst was very flattering. He said he'd like to be there if I was.
Wouldn't you like to see me in London?
I don't know that I'll ever be in London.
I don't see how anybody can shoot a thing like this.
Why don't you teach me how to shoot?
It might be important if there's a battle.
Alright. Come on.
Well... first you pull the gun tight into your shoulder like this. And...
Well, here.
Tight into your shoulder and...
Well, right hand near the trigger.
No, here.
Left hand out to support it.
A little more. Right.
Now. No, you have to use this hand to support it.
Now you sight along the barrel here.
You don't mind?
Why do you think I wanted you to teach me?
- Roberta! Where are you?
- I'm over here.
May I have this next dance, m'lady?
You said that's what you missed.
- It's to make you feel at home.
- Where ever did you get that?
You wish the name of my tailor, sir?
Go past the town square, take the first street to the left.
- Weren't you covering the pits?
- Weren't you working on the bridge?
He was teaching me how to shoot.
I asked him to.
Fritz.
Come here a minute.
I want to show you something.
If you'd like to learn how to shoot,
Roberta, I'd be happy to teach you.
I think I have the general idea.
The old tiger, he'll come along here like this at night, after the pit's been all covered up, and he'll sniff the meat...
...and he'll start to circle the pit.
(yowls)
He'll come around here like this
...and he'll think, "I think I just might grab that big hunk of meat."
So he gets down like this, gets like this, and then...
Tell me, Francis, don't show me. Or you'll be in there before your tiger!
Anyhow, he'll jump for the bait and that's how I'll catch my tiger.
Think a tiger's going to fall for this? You're wasting your time.
You talk about wasting time.
How many hours did you spend making that silly hat?
None of your business.
You're not my boss.
No? We've got more important things to do than try to amuse Roberta.
You're jealous.
Jealous? Of what?
Why don't you grow up?
That's enough, Ernst.
Fight!
Now hit him, Fritz. Ow!
Come on, Fritz. Get him.
Fight!
Come on, Ernst. Fight.
Get him, Ernst. Come on.
Get him, Ernst.
What a beauty!
Now your turn.
Come on, Fritz, get him.
Fight. Are you afraid of him, Ernst?
Poke him one.
Come on, Fritz. Ernst!
- What's this all about?
- Nothing.
Who started it?
You know,
I think this is probably my fault.
I think I've been pushing everybody just a bit too hard.
It might do us a lot of good to relax for a change.
So here's what we're going to do.
Tomorrow, we are going to observe the first national holiday in the history of New Switzerland.
A holiday? You mean like Christmas?
Now let's get on with the work.
Get ready for it.
Yippee. A holiday. We're going to have a holiday, Roberta.
(roars)
- Where did we get all these flags?
- I got them off the ship.
- Allow me.
- Thank you.
(growls)
How do you like this?
For the winner of the race.
I'd better try it on for size.
Not going to argue?
Just conceding that I'll win?
This afternoon you and Ernst were fighting. It was my fault.
- It wasn't your fault.
- Everything that's happened lately is because you brought me back, even the danger we're in from pirates.
You didn't ask to be brought here.
In fact, you had quite different ideas. Remember?
Poor Ernst. The hours he must have spent making that silly hat.
He didn't mean to neglect his work.
He was just trying to be nice to me.
- I know that.
- I never dreamed he'd do that.
I did hope I could repay your family and all I've done is cause trouble between you. I didn't want to.
Don't.
Roberta, I'm not much at saying things, you know, but...
It's no good. When we leave here, you're going on and I'm going back to London.
Let's not make it difficult.
When we leave here? How do you know we're ever going to?
We might be here...
(roar)
- My tiger! I bet I got him!
- Francis, come back here.
Look out, Ernst.
(roaring)
- He might be anywhere.
- Let me go!
Francis, wait till we get there.
It's my tiger. Let me go.
Mind the pit.
Where is he?
I would never have believed it!
Well done, Francis.
Let's cover it with palm leaves so he'll go to sleep and the pirates won't know he's there.
Go and tell Mother. We'll do it.
Yes.
You don't have to worry any more!
I got my tiger!
He's got his tiger.
Everybody back behind the starting line.
Stay back.
Hang on.
Mother, you hold Duke, will you?
That's it.
You go round the first pylon and then over to that one, then back and forth three times and here to the finish.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, to the winner this gorgeous culinary creation which all of us will eat.
Quiet. Serving as official starter, the loveliest lady of the canton.
Quick! Come back!
Quick, Mother, fire.
Faster.
Come on, Rocky, get going.
Come on, Duchess. Run, girl.
That way. Come on, Rocky.
I can't get on! Give me a chance.
No, Turk, get out of here, you're ruining everything.
Look out, Mother.
Wait a minute, Ernst.
- No, not that way.
- Hold it, Clementine.
Jump on.
Good boy, Lightning.
You're going the wrong way, Roberta.
Come on, Rocky.
Stand still.
Now we're going to win.
It's not good if you can't stay on him, Fritz.
Turk, get away.
Not fair, Ernst, you have to ride him.
- Come on, Rocky, we're going to win.
- Come on, Lightning.
Straight on.
No, not that way, the other way.
No, the other way.
Come on.
Now.
I give up. Come on, Clementine.
Come on!
Out of my way.
I'm going to ride you if it's the last thing I do.
Quick, the tape.
That's not the way you're supposed to go!
Wrong way, Roberta.
Roberta. Come back here.
Come on, Rocky, we're winning!
Not fair, Roberta, I was winning!
You're not hurt?
- Pirates on the beach.
- What?
Pirates on our beach.
- Up the hill, everybody, quick!
- I'll get the muskets.
Come on, Roberta. Come on.
Remember your orders?
Get started!
Yes, sir!
(barking)
Come on. Come on, Francis.
(barking)
Duke, Turk, come back.
No time now. They'll be alright.
Come along, Mother.
Come on, Francis.
Just stay quiet.
Quick.
(barking)
Frances
(whistles)
They've seen us.
They've seen us. The bridge, quick.
Alright, Mother?
Here, Duke! Here, Turk!
Good boy.
- Ready, Ernst?
- Ready.
Now!
Fritz, Ernst, come up.
Come up.
(screams)
They must be getting near it now.
Over this way a bit.
(roaring)
My tiger! He got them.
(screams)
(screams)
Number three.
Now, don't light it till I tell you.
Now.
The flame is meant to reach the powder at the same time as the pirates.
See what I mean? Give me the torch.
Bull's-eye!
They're running!
- Now the coconut bombs.
- No, not yet.
- They're coming round this way.
- Don't fire yet.
Get back.
We've got them on the run.
- Right. The coconut bombs.
- Good!
Ka-boom!
That's it.
Keep throwing.
We haven't stopped them. Use the rifles. Try and pick off the leaders.
Where are you going, Father?
Hurray, hurray1
It worked.
Watch those logs fall down.
There's a man getting squashed.
(roars)
We're safe!
Kuala make talk.
You hear?
We hear you.
You take boy belong Kuala.
Give us boy, no more fight.
You hear?
You want the boy? Come and get him.
We're ready for you.
You can put away your white flag.
- Maybe it would be better to agree.
- Don't worry.
He wouldn't bargain if he thought he could beat us.
Send the boy down the hill.
Kuala take boy.
Nobody hurt.
You hear?
You make Kuala fight long time then you die!
And Kuala take boy all the same.
It's true. You can't possibly hold them off forever.
You don't look like a boy any more.
If you give yourself up now...
But what will happen to all of you if I don't?
Nothing's going to happen to anybody.
He must think we're mad.
Roberta, don't listen.
(cow bells)
My pirate alarm.
They're coming up that way.
Quick. Down!
Look out! Father, look out!
Ernst, look.
Stay back.
Get down!
- How many rounds have we got left?
- Five.
Five.
(canon fire)
They're very close.
(canon fire)
They're running away.
(canon fire)
It's a ship. A merchantman.
They're firing on the pirates.
One of my grandfather's ships.
I knew he'd come for us.
- Yippee. Here we are!
- We're here!
- Can I see your hat, please?
- Of course.
Thank you.
No more, thank you.
That was delicious.
Nothing to it, my boy. I've given money to that college for years.
It's time I asked for something.
Well, Roberta and I have talked about school but a... university!
I never dreamed!
I'm going to a university!
As for the rest of you,
I won't try to influence you but if you'd like to return to Europe,
I could give you an interesting fresh start.
But if you still want to go to New
Guinea I'll happily take you there.
I think that since we have to decide forever, that...
...my husband and I would just rather stay here.
That's what you want?
It's been a good life for us here.
As Roberta says, there are things you have to do without.
But they're unimportant if people aren't around feeling sorry for you.
You mean I don't have to go?
Fritz and Ernst will go with you.
We'll keep Francis for a few years.
- I'll be back.
- You won't be without neighbours.
You realise that? This is a new island. There'll be a new colony,
- a new governor.
- You might be made governor, Father.
More than likely I should say.
Hello.
It's funny how you can change your mind about what's important.
What it is you really want.
Take your parents.
All of this time they've been wanting to get to New Guinea and now they have their chance they find everything they want is here.
You mean they're not going?
- I can understand how they feel.
- I do, too.
Two people, if they have each other, what more could they want?
I guess just to be alone.
Fritz, it's time to go now. The
Captain wants to sail with the tide.
Just coming.
Surely you'll want to go and see him off?
Anyway, I'll have to explain to my grandfather.
- Bye, Ernst.
- Good luck next year.
Goodbye, Mother, Father,
Fritz, Roberta.
Bye, Ernst.
God be with you.
Wait for me! Duchess!
Clementine! Turk!
(barking)

Mr Bond?
Yes?
I'm Lieutenant Mathis of the Special Police.
These are my credentials.
They appear to be in order.
Come with me.
They used to say a good spy is a pure spy, inside and out.
Roses, Tanagra figurines and Debussy.
He plays Debussy every afternoon from sunset until it's too dark to read the music.
Stands on his head a lot, eats royal jelly.
Lets his intestines down and washes them by hand.
Something he learned during his sojourn in Tibet.
M, what gives?
I forgot to mention lions.
- Lions and more lions.
- We're surrounded by lions.
I did not come here to be devoured by symbols of monarchy!
I warn you, M, if this is a trap...
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.
It's no trap, I assure you.
The lions are only curious.
He has few visitors.
That I can believe.
A veritable Eden, is it not, gentlemen?
Eden without an Eve is an absurdity.
A good spy is a pure spy.
Not good. Great.
The greatest spy in history, gentlemen.
The true, one and only, original James Bond.
- The gentlemen are here, Sir James.
- Thank you.
- My dear Bond.
- My dear M.
Ransome, CIA, Sir James.
J-Junior cipher c-clerk in m-my day, weren't you, Ransome?
Yes, sir. JCC, class G, SIC to SCCT.
CIA, Washington DC.
Smernov, KGB, Sir James.
Ah, yes. L-Labour camp inspector.
Ikon 988, GPU, Siberian sector.
I remember your ch-chap Lenin very well.
First-class organiser, second-class mind.
Le Grand, Sir James.
{y:bi}Deuxième bureau.
Promoted at last from the vice detail?
How incredibly well you look, James.
Time, my dear M, does not exist within these walls.
- They ain't for real.
- Yes, a far cry from our embattled world.
In my day spying was an alternative to war.
The spy was a member of a select and immaculate priesthood, vocationally d-devoted, sublimely disinterested.
Hardly a description of that sexual acrobat who leaves a t-trail of beautiful dead women like blown roses behind him.
- You mean...
- You know very well who I mean.
That b-bounder to whom you gave my name and number.
My dear James, when you left us we were a small service, under-financed, ludicrously ill-equipped.
It was essential that your legend be maintained.
Without a James Bond 007, no one would have respected us.
Him and his wretched g-gadgets.
We must make use of the weapons of our time.
So I observe.
You, Ransome, with your trick carnation that s-spits cyanide.
You ought to be ashamed.
The Russians started it.
And you, Smernov, with an armoury concealed in your grotesque boots.
Listen to them tinkle.
And you, Le Grand, with a different deadly poison in each of your fly buttons.
And you, M, with your flame-throwing fountain pens.
Y-Y-You're joke-shop spies, gentlemen.
We are in the last half of the 20th century, Sir James.
- Even you have to face it.
- Why should l, when I can face that?
Look at my garden.
Out there, there is a black rose.
Not dark red, but black.
As a raven's wing at midnight.
I would not exchange one single petal for anything your world has to offer, including an Aston M-Martin with lethal accessories.
You have only contempt for the proletariat, Sir James. This we know.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you'd lost your faith in democracy.
You can break the glass, but you can't hold back the weather.
Things are bad. I've lost 11 agents in the last fortnight - seven killed, four missing.
- Is my namesake among them?
- He may well be tomorrow.
Eight of ours were given the works - two in the Pentagon.
- KGB is depleted.
I cannot disclose exact figures.
The enemy has penetrated our most secret inner circles.
- He reads our very mind.
- For all we know, he has his eye on us now.
Are you quite sure he is not one or m-more of you?
- No, no.
- Absolutely sure.
Until this danger is past, we must stand united in the defence of all spies, great or small, regardless of nationality.
Calamity makes strange b-bedfellows, but why, in the strength of your unity, do you disturb a gentleman in his retirement?
We need your inspirational leadership.
Please give us the benefit of your incomparable powers of deduction.
- For all freedom-loving peoples.
- For the glorious socialist revolution.
If I may interrupt this flow of clichés, it is now that time of day
I have set apart for Debussy.
Can this be the man who won a Victoria Cross at Mafeking?
The hero of the Ashanti Uprising?
What genius to be wasted in the service of a crumbling empire.
Why, at the height of his powers, did Bond decide to retire?
Mata Hari, my dear friend.
- What's the connection?
- The woman in his life.
- I don't get it.
- It was his painful duty to lure her across the Spanish frontier into France, where we stood her in front of a firing squad.
He really loved that woman.
Well, James?
I'm sorry, old man, but what you ask is quite impossible.
Perhaps this will change your decision.
My record speaks my loyalty.
But no, not even for her, McTarry.
Sorry, James.
There's McTarry's signal. Stand by.
- Zero.
- On.
- Fire!
- Fire!
Up 200!
{y:bi}- Authority to Control.
- Go ahead.
{y:bi}Proceed with Smersh Plan B.
{y:bi}Sir James Bond is back, with his morals,
{y:bi}his vows, and his celibate image.
{y:bi}We must destroy that image.
Riverbank to Control.
{y:bi}- Go ahead.
- The target has just entered Scotland.
- M's castle to Control.
{y:bi}- M's name is McTarry. Use it.
Plan B in operation.
McTarry Castle completely occupied, with only one change.
Agent Mimi is now M's widow.
{y:bi}Agent Mimi impersonating Lady Fiona?
Well, she has the best Scots accent.
And that's all that's left of the McTarry.
Your husband d-died as he lived,
Lady Fiona. In the service of Her Majesty.
I thought it would be my p-painful duty to impart the news.
How did you know your husband M -
I'm sorry, McTarry - was dead?
- We were told.
- Might I ask who told you?
- The Grey Piper.
- The who?
Tell Sir James about the Grey Piper, lass.
Whenever a McTarry dies, he comes down from the mountain, over the loch and through the heather, playing the clan lament.
We always put a tappit-hen of usquebaugh outside the castle door.
- Tappit-hen?
- A quart o' whisky.
- Is he a real p-piper?
- We dinna ken.
But it's been the same one for 600 years.
- Naught else remains?
- Nothing to s-speak of, I'm afraid.
It was found in a tree,
100 yards from where he stood.
Took off, as it were, and flew like a b-bird.
But whether it is an article of apparel or an anatomical f-feature, that is the question.
Should it be given Christian burial?
Just how p-personal is a toupee?
It can only be regarded as a "hairloom".
Eliza, put it wi' all the other relics of McTarry glory.
We all ken that our beloved McTarry of the Glen was a different man in Whitehall.
But McTarry women never ask questions.
According to clan tradition, when the laird dies a black he-goat must be ta'en alive off Ben Tarry by six barefoot virgins.
I myself slaughter it.
The daughters wrest the stomach out, and stuff it wi' entrails.
Bright entrails.
Sear it, boil it, and serve it up.
And eat it?
- Warm reekin'.
- Sounds d-delicious.
We start feastin' at midnight, washin' the haggis down wi' usquebaugh.
One gies strength to the limbs, the other fire to the blood for dancin'.
- Dancing?
- The McTarry funeral fling.
"Argar, argar garar goru argar" it goes.
- Most m-moving.
- Ah, we dance till we fall in our tracks.
And after an hour's repose, the piper wakes us to the tune o' "Awa' to the Grouse" and awa' we go to the memorial grouse shoot.
B-But surely the grouse are not in season?
Whenever a McTarry dies, the grouse come into season.
I'm Heather.
I'm Meg. Your bath's ready, Sir James.
- Thank you.
- At the end of the passage.
- Very kind of you.
- Let us help you out o' your duddies.
- No, thank you. I can manage m-my...
- We always helped Daddy.
How many of you are there?
D-Daughters, I mean.
- 11 in all.
- 11? M-My word.
And how do the ages run?
Who is the... How young is the youngest?
- And the eldest?
You mean there are only...?
That's my loose kneecap.
There are only three years between all 11 of you?
Some of us are adopted daughters.
I see. Steady.
- Are there any m-men in the house?
- Nane but the pipers.
My daddy only liked the lassies.
Your d-daddy really was a d-different man in Whitehall.
I'm testing the temperature of the water as I always did for my daddy.
He used to call me his little thermometer.
Well? Get in.
- Get in?
- Get in!
You're sure I'm not c-crowding you?
Get in.
Do you like your back scrubbed?
Thank you.
- What is your n-name, my dear?
- Buttercup.
- How old are you?
- Do you go to school?
- Daddy taught us.
There. You're as sleek as a baby.
Now, turn round.
What form are you in?
Can ye nae judge that for yourself, Sir James?
- What is your favourite subject?
- Anatomy.
That's your mediastinum.
That's your
{y:bi}orbicularis oris.
That's your Azygos vein.
That's your articular cartilage, and those are your synovial membranes.
- Right, right.
- It's getting gey cold!
- Quite.
- My daddy liked it hotter.
I am not your d-da... Quite.
Thank you.
- To the laird!
- To the laird!
To your right, Sir James - Lady Mary, daughter of Lord Douglas McTarry, raped by the Campbells in 1622.
In retaliation of which,
Lord Douglas sent his only son Hamish out to rape twa Campbell lassies.
- At the same t-time?
- Eldest first, of course.
As prescribed by scripture.
The youngest bore him triplets.
Their union being thus bounteously blessed, a contract of marriage was entered into which brought the McTarrys Black Loch,
Ben Torn, the Shags of Raugh,
Glen Noch, and a good stretch of salmon water.
All the best.
I say, does she...?
Good night, ladies.
Sleep I've had nane for thinkin' on my dearie.
All the long night I walk, grovellin' in grief.
Comfort me, Jamie lad.
Gie me your bosom to weep on.
- Doudle me, Jamie.
- Really, madam!
I hereby claim my widow's due according to McTarry tradition.
Let me be comforted.
Doudle me!
A quaint custom, but one more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
Then you'll have to pay the piper!
The p-piper?
You heard me, you mean-mou'd, ill-willie cuif!
You'll have to pay the piper!
Robin! Jock!
Sandy!
You've been challenged to warsle with Sir James.
He wants to warsle.
I haven't warsled for years.
I may be a little out of p-practice.
Play ball!
Ha!
{y:bi}Superbe!
{y:bi}Formidable!
{y:bi}Splendide! Bravo!
{y:bi}Magnifique. Mais...
Surprising how quickly it all comes back.
Ah, well. A little b-beauty sleep before the grouse shoot, perhaps?
Beaters, follow Marie over to the butts.
Eliza, stay here with me for the countdown.
Oh, my love is like a red, red rose that's newly sprung in June.
- Fire, Mission.
- Roger.
- Fuse alarm missiles.
- Roger.
- Supercharge.
- Roger.
Fire.
The button!
The button!
The button!
- Oh, beloved!
- Good of you to join me.
- The button! The button!
- She's with him.
Magnetic! Homing device!
- Which button is it? Let me look!
- There's a knife in my pocket.
- See!
- Take off my braces.
My braces.
And now, madam, if you'd be kind enough to furnish a few answers.
Our orders were to corrupt you, to befoul your image of yourself.
Failing that, we were to kill you.
- I see.
- Look! They've found the button.
- Who g-gave you these orders?
- Authority.
International Mothers' Help, East Berlin.
Jolly good sport, what?
You're wounded.
'Tis but a thimbleful.
But heart's blood.
Farewell, Jamie.
My dear.
Again. Say it again.
James Bond, my jo James.
James Bond, my jo.
My dear.
One more request.
The last.
Think of me as the second woman in your life.
The one after Mata Hari.
Kiss me, Jamie.
Kiss me goodbye.
Madam! Are you quite sure you're dying?
Not dying, but giving up my life.
I'm going to another world.
There's a convent over that hill.
{y:bi}Bond leaving Scotland now.
{y:bi}Instructions understood.
Jag to Dairy. Contact in position.
{y:bi}- Get ready to delivermilk.
- Dairy to Jag. Understood.
- Stand by, Remote Control.
- Remote control ready.
Speed ready. Distance ready.
- Start milk float.
- Contact.
- Distance 75 yards.
- Accelerating.
- Prime detonators.
- Check.
- Gap has widened.
- 30 yards.
- Retract detonators.
- Check.
- Hold it. He's too close.
- Dropping speed.
Ignore Jag. Increase speed.
- Distance gauge failing.
- Vision failing. No vision.
Switch to automatic control.
Hello, Jag. Are you receiving me?
Drop speed. I'm in direct line.
Jag to Dairy. Drop speed now!
Hello, Jag. Come in, Jag.
- Detonators out.
- Out.
Good Lord! Moneypenny.
You haven't changed a bit.
Actually,
I'm Miss Moneypenny's daughter.
- How is your dear mother?
- After you left, she took the vows.
That seems to be the in thing to do these days.
I must say, this place brings back a few memories.
Yes, Mother told me some of them.
She probably also told you that I'm partial to jasmine tea. Lapsang Souchong.
By the way, since I came in here have you noticed me stammer?
- No, sir.
- Let me know if I do.
I haven't got time for that now.
- Will you be needing me tonight, sir?
- Very probably.
If I'm to take over this department,
I have to know all M's secrets.
Not his personal ones, of course.
- May I say welcome back, Sir James.
- Thank you...
- Hadley, sir.
- Of course. You were...
- My father's son, sir.
- And where is your dear father now?
- The same place, sir.
- That's encouraging.
Bring me up to date.
Who's on what assignment?
- It's not a happy picture.
- Why the black flags?
They've been liquidated, I'm afraid.
Finland - stabbed to death in a ladies' sauna bath, sir.
Madrid - burnt in a blazing bordello, sir.
And Tokyo, sir - garrotted in a geisha house.
It's depressing that "secret agent" has become synonymous with "sex maniac".
- Incidentally, where is my namesake?
- We had to take him off the board, sir.
He's now doing television.
Why are there two flags in the Caribbean?
We've been out of contact for a month, sir. We're not sure which one to leave.
- Who's there?
- Your nephew, sir. Jimmy Bond.
Rather a disappointment,
I'm afraid, little Jimmy.
Listen. You can't shoot me.
I have a very low threshold of death.
My doctor says I can't have bullets enter my body at any time.
What if I said I was pregnant?
Could I have a last c-cigarette?
I'm gonna give it up any day now.
Thank you.
{y:bi}¡Listos!
You realise this means an angry letter to The Times.
{y:bi}¡Apunten!
{y:bi}¡Fuego!
So long, suckers!
{y:bi}¡Apunten! ¡Fuego!
And so I think we'd better count him out, sir.
Yes. Hadley, we're up against an opposition of fiendish ingenuity.
- They make incredible use of women.
- Yes, they tend to nowadays.
Female spies harassed me in Scotland, female spies chased me to London.
We need an AFSD -
Anti-Female-Spy Device.
We find the one man all women want, then we train him not to want women.
All our wantable agents have disappeared, sir.
This is where you come in.
Go through all the auxiliary files.
The lot, sir? It'll take all night.
Your mother did her best work at night.
Shall we continue?
- And what is your name?
- Cooper, Big Eyes. But call me Coop.
- Like something for keeping birds.
- That's me.
- I have to note your qualifications.
- Height 6ft 1/2, 184lb.
Trophies for karate and judo, holder of the Kamasutra black belt.
- Very impressive. How do you spell that?
- I'll show you.
I have to check 15 more auxiliaries in alphabetical...
Call Mr Zacharias and tell him not to wait up. The vacancy's just been filled.
A first-class performance, Cooper.
Excellent.
- Your primary statistics fit the bill.
- We aim to please, sir.
You will start your AFSD training immediately.
Moneypenny, get a few dozen girls for Cooper to start with.
- Moneypenny?
- A few dozen girls...
I appreciate your confidence, sir.
All agents and trainees will now be known as James Bond 007, including the girls.
Won't that be confusing, sir?
The enemy won't know which way to turn. You are now James Bond.
Congratulations, 007.
And you, 007... sir.
Good hunting, 007.
Doesn't that do something to you, 007?
It does but I'm being trained to ignore it.
Beauty's only skin-deep.
How about some skin diving?
Not today, Lorelei.
Right. Ting-Ling.
You know that every fifth child born in the world is Chinese?
- They'll have to keep it up without me.
- Why are you so inscrutable?
- That's meant to be our racket.
- You might be a double agent.
- What would you do if I was?
- Whether you are or not, sayonara.
Next. Shirley.
- You're not Shirley.
- No.
I'm the new secret weapon.
- I've just been perfected.
- Yes, haven't you?
- They've kept me under wraps.
- Lucky them.
What do you do that's so secret?
I don't do anything.
But unless you're one of them, you do.
You're really learning to put up quite a resistance.
- It goes against my nature.
- I sense that too.
- What are you doing after the exercise?
- Getting my head examined.
Our man in Delhi tells us gold will be up two points by midday tomorrow.
Buy gold.
- It'll cost you three nuclear warheads.
- Offer two.
Your offer for Rockefeller Center is accepted.
I've changed my mind. I like London.
What about Lord Nelson's statue?
It was delivered today, Miss Lynd.
My dear Miss Lynd.
- Who are you, sir?
- I am Sir James Bond.
But I thought you were retired, Sir James.
The whole world believes you were eaten by a shark.
That was no shark, that was my personal submarine.
But enough of this polite conversation.
- What is the purpose of your visit?
- I desperately need your help.
My dear Sir James, I hardly ever undertake assignments these days.
I can see why, but I think I can persuade you to undertake this one.
Your reputation is remarkable.
But believe me when I say
I save all my energies for business.
I have here a writ for just over £5 million tax arrears.
If you were to be cooperative,
I could arrange easy payments and a substantial discount?
Perhaps we should discuss this matter in comfort, Sir James.
Thank you. What a charming outfit that is.
Do you often wear that in the office?
If I wore it in the street, people might stare.
You said, Sir James, you needed my help.
I did, didn't l? I have a dossier on a man who works at the Buckingham Club.
His name is Evelyn Tremble.
Mr Evelyn Tremble?
- Yes, that's right.
- Isn't Evelyn a girl's name?
No, it's mine actually.
- Do you know me from somewhere?
- Your book: Tremble On Baccarat.
I've studied it very closely.
At night, in my bed.
Is that where you study it?
There are several passes you describe in your book which I don't fully understand.
Which passes are these?
They're all marked. I would have to have my book. Your book.
And my book is in...
My bed.
You're winning tonight.
I'll send my car for you.
- Yes?
{y:bi}- Hello. It's me, Evelyn Tremble.
Hello, Mr Tremble.
Can you hold on for a moment?
Eric? Don't forget to empty the deepfreeze first thing in the morning.
Hello, Mr Tremble.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, but I was just seeing someone off.
Come right up, all right? Bye-bye.
- So nice of you to come.
- My pleasure.
This way.
{y:bi}# The look of love
{y:bi}# Is in your eyes
{y:bi}# A look your smile can't disguise
{y:bi}# The look oflove
{y:bi}# It's saying so much more
{y:bi}than just words could ever say
{y:bi}# And what my heart has heard
{y:bi}# Well, it takes my breath away
{y:bi}# I can hardly wait to hold you
{y:bi}# Feel my arms around you
{y:bi}# How long I have waited
{y:bi}# Waited just to love you
{y:bi}# Now that I have found you
{y:bi}# You've got the look of love
{y:bi}# It's on your face
{y:bi}# The look that time can't erase
Hello.
Hello.
That's Lord Nelson, isn't it?
- Yes. Isn't he beautiful?
- Yes.
- And do you know what he said?
- What?
England expects every man to do his duty.
So he did, yes. But this is Mayfair.
Lord Nelson's in Trafalgar Square surely.
No, not any more. He's mine.
Haven't you read the papers today?
- I don't normally get them quite so early.
- I get 'em before they're printed.
I suppose you can do anything if you have money.
Why don't you come down to me?
Thank you very much.
Lovely place you've got down there.
Sit here.
I do so like to feel comfortable whatever I'm doing.
Yes indeed. Yes.
The more relaxed the muscles, the better the synchronisation between mind and body.
I should think you're frightfully synchronised, Mr Tremble.
- Martini?
- What about them?
I was just about to offer you one.
The things I didn't understand too well in your book. Let me see...
Was it in chapter seven or chapter six?
Chapter six probably.
Though of course it could have been chapter seven.
Have you got the book or is it still in your bed?
I believe it is.
Well, we'd better go right through the book, hadn't we?
Do you get many complaints from the neighbours?
Do you really think that your system is completely faultless?
- Which system?
- Your system for winning at baccarat.
Yes, yes.
The Evelyn Tremble system is faultless.
Good. Come on. We have more to do.
More?
I like a man who is able to retain his own personality, no matter what the circumstances.
Yes.
No matter how he's dressed.
They say it's the clothes that make the man.
If we're gonna work together, I have to know what kind of a man you are.
I thought you might have gathered a little from...
I want to see what happens when you put on a different hat, a costume.
You know, that sort of thing.
- You like that sort of thing, eh?
- You'll find clothes in there. Put them on.
Well, if you think it's really necessary.
Unless you'd like to go around one more time.
One more time?
There is nothing wrong with the British
Army that a damn good swim won't cure.
Now, Evelyn Tremble.
38 years old, born in Highgate.
Hello, sailor.
The wrong one, yes?
Perfect.
Distinguishing birthmark, little scar on right shoulder, strawberry-shaped birthmark on left thigh.
Well, there's nothing unusual in that.
No. I myself have an apricot one on my hip.
Well, I'll show you my strawberry if you'll show me your apricot.
Author of a book on baccarat.
Have you ever heard of a man called Le Chiffre?
Yes. An excellent card player.
He once wrote me a fan letter.
Keep your hands there. Perfect. Lovely.
I devoted a chapter to him in my book.
His forte is baccarat.
Beside baccarat, he deals in lechery.
Well, nobody's perfect.
Do you think you can win against Le Chiffre?
Well, you'll remember that to operate my system completely free of risk a stake of £100,000 is required.
Yes, I remember.
Stand still.
I'm gonna give you a 500th at f2.
That's the nicest thing that anyone's ever said to me.
What would you say if I offered to stake you in a game against Le Chiffre?
What?
I put up the money, you play the game and we split 50-50.
- I think I'll go now if you don't mind.
- What's wrong?
I enjoyed the earlier part of this evening very much.
I shall always remember the pleasure of your company.
I didn't even mind this dressing-up bit.
But I do mind bloody unnecessary jokes about the one thing I really know well.
Evelyn, I'm serious. It's because you know about baccarat that I'm not joking.
You said you needed £100,000?
- It's yours.
- That's fantastic.
But look here. Old Le Chiffre would never agree to play me.
He's read my book.
He'd recognise my name.
- No, no. Not any more.
- Why?
We have chosen a new name for you.
James Bond.
{y:bi}Welcome to
{y:bi}the James Bond 007 training school.
It's a small Minnox camera, isn't it?
A friend of mine's got one of those.
- It's Mr Bond, isn't it?
- Yes.
If you'd be good enough to sign here, sir.
It's not for me.
It's for the Official Secrets Act.
Of course.
Eyes right!
Eyes front!
- Carry on, Sergeant Major.
- Yes, sir. Mark time!
Halt! About turn.
You really do stock everything at Harrod's.
Don't pay too much attention.
It's all basic stuff.
It'll be out of date by the January sales.
- Good morning, Johnson.
- Sir!
May I tell you something?
- I'm being followed.
- I know. It's part of the training.
Shadowing people without being seen.
The whole point is I can quite clearly see the man who is shadowing me.
Oh! Him. Don't worry about him.
He's not one of our trainees.
- He's our security man.
- I see.
Good morning, lnspector.
Don't let me interrupt you.
On the command, the head is turned thus, the hat is aimed thus, the gun is fired thus.
Yes, we're still working on that one.
Now to Agents' Outfitting. Here we are.
- Morning, Q.
- Good morning, Fordyce. New man.
If I could bother you for the signature, sir.
I shouldn't use that pen.
The moment the nib touches the paper, it releases a stream of poisonous gas into the writer's eye.
Good heavens!
What will they think of next?
I won't be going near that.
I suppose it's useful if you want to send anyone a...
Poison-pen letter.
All our new men say that. I reply "I don't wish to know that. Kindly leave Ml5."
Yes, sir. We have a very highly developed sense of humour down here.
It isn't the only thing that's highly developed down here. Fordyce!
- Wristwatch.
- Sir.
1965 Rolex Oyster Perpetual.
Date indicator and log table round the outer band.
And a thing that shows you what shape the moon is.
- Now, this is very important. Try it on.
- Let me help you.
It's your means of reporting to us and our means of contacting you.
Channel six, Fordyce.
Don't worry too much about him, sir.
Channel six it is, sir.
I don't think I know which one is which myself now, sir.
Look at your watch and tell me what you see.
It's five and 20 minutes past 11 .
It's the 14th of March and...
I said channel six, Fordyce.
Well, nobody's perfect.
But it's absolutely amazing!
I've never seen anything like this.
It's a two-way television and radio wristwatch.
It's an American idea. They got it from one of their comic strips.
- Good heavens.
- Ah! Tea.
Three lumps.
It's an incredible thing, this.
Which side do you dress, sir?
- I usually dress away from the window.
- It's just some protective clothing, sir.
Let me help you out of your hampering things.
And it is of course Sanforized, sir, non-iron, and also available in chocolate, oyster or clerical grey.
- It's hand-reefed and double-charvered.
- Is it?
- It's a little tight around the...
- Poison capsule compartment?
I'm sure we can let it out above the switchblade and Geiger counter.
Do what you can, Fordyce.
Your intercom button's in here with midget transmitters for short-range contacts.
There's an infrared camera, a tape recorder in the shoulder padding, a Beretta in the buttonhole, and a cute little minigun in the gusset.
Yes. Just one thing.
What happens if I suddenly need to go somewhere?
In this, sir? You'll find safety instructions under the left lapel.
Don't worry.
You're in very good hands here.
Now this won't hurt a bit, sir.
{y:bi}- Who g-gave you these orders?
{y:bi}- International Mothers' Help, East Berlin.
There it is, Hadley. Our only clue.
The voice of a beautiful woman.
We've checked it out, sir.
It's a Smersh cover operation, sir.
It supplies baby-sitters and au pair girls to some of the most important families.
Then it must be infiltrated by someone absolutely reliable.
- I hope you weren't thinking of me.
- I was thinking of Mata.
- You can't mean Mata Hari, sir.
- No, her daughter Mata Bond.
- Mata Bond, sir?
- Her mother gave her that name because I happen to be the child's sort of godfather.
And to think that you knew Mata Hari!
She really was one of the greats.
Yes. Great little dancer, terrible spy.
Whereas young Mata is a terrible dancer.
Might be a great little spy.
It's uncanny. Quite uncanny.
What memories it brings back.
Paris, Berlin, Vienna.
How madly we danced through the night.
- I was disguised as a Hungarian hussar...
- What are you going on about?
You're the very image of your mother and every bit as beautiful.
You knew my mum?
I am Sir James Bond.
- Daddy!
- My child.
- Snail's egg?
- No, thanks. They don't agree with me.
Well, you're a charmer, aren't you?
You dump me in an orphanage when I'm three, and now, because you need me...
It really was very difficult.
My career was at its height...
It was a traumatic experience,
I can tell you, being the illegitimate daughter of Mata Hari and James Bond.
Still, you do get my monthly paychecks?
Your monthly paychecks went on analysts' fees.
That's why I came here.
I had to get away from it all.
I had no idea. Well, I must say, you seem to be very comfortable here.
It's crazy. You want a drag?
No, thank you. I'm trying to give that up.
Who are all these people?
They're the high priests of the temple.
OK, Fred. Hop it.
Extraordinary performance.
They seem to treat you like a goddess.
Well, I am the Celestial Virgin of the Sacred Altar.
- Figuratively speaking, of course.
- Of course. Some tea.
A cup of tea. Splendid.
It's made from poppy seeds. Two cups of this and you're stoned out of your mind.
Thank you.
You know, if you weren't my dad,
I think I could fancy you.
Well, that's very good of you, my dear.
- Rather warm in here, don't you think?
- Cool it, Charlie.
So you want me to go to Berlin, huh?
Now, Mata. You remember the old house on the Feldmannstrasse?
- Where Mum had her dancing school.
- It's become lnternational Mothers' Help.
But that's just a cover for its real function. It is...
- Does he speak English?
- Hey, Charlie. Speak English?
- No.
- Good.
It is a training centre for what are commonly referred to as spies.
You are eminently suited to infiltrate the organisation.
Two weeks' briefing in London and you're off to Berlin.
You want me to be a spy like Mum, huh?
- Well!
- Family tradition, my dear.
Do I get an exploding briefcase and a secret transmitter?
- That won't be necessary.
- I have to have some equipment.
Your mother wiped out three divisions of infantry and five of cavalry and...
Well, frankly, she had much less equipment than you have.
If you have any problems, contact London immediately.
- Are there any questions?
- Well, I have got one question.
- How do I get to Berlin?
- Oh, dear! Silly me.
Taxi!
- Where to?
- Berlin.
- East or West?
- West, of course.
Well, that's all right, then.
- Say goodbye to Dad for me.
- Yes. Have a good trip. Jolly good luck.
Get out of it, you lunatic!
What are you trying to do?
Come on! Move. Get out of it.
Get out the way! Go on.
- That'll be £482 15s 9d.
- You'll have to wait.
I've been caught like that before.
I haven't had my dinner yet.
- I don't have any change.
- Here we go.
What about my dinner then, eh?
What a liberty. Any fish and chip shops round here, mush?
Who are you? What do you want?
I'm here to enrol as a student.
What are your qualifications?
- I am the daughter of Mata Hari.
- Mata Hari!
- You are a liar.
- Am l?
Well, what about this, then?
My little Mata Hari!
- I told you she'd come back!
- Silence! Or I will switch you off.
Not that! Anything but that.
You're even more fascinating than your mother.
You must be Frau Hoffner,
Mum's teacher.
- I had that honour.
- You must be Polo.
She remembers me, her little Polo.
She remembers me.
- Welcome home.
- Welcome indeed.
Shtum!
The Mata Hari School of Dancing is the only international school of espionage.
There is no political prejudice here.
We train Russian spies for America und American spies for Russia.
- Very democratic.
- Very democratic.
Some of the greatest spies in the world have graduated from this institution.
- Von Grudendorf, Malenvosky...
- Peter Lorre, Bela Lugosi.
Here we have the decoding and cipher class.
We are even training animals as espionage agents.
We have in the Kremlin a Russian-speaking parrot in constant radio communication with the Pentagon.
Und here is our class in karate und self-defence.
Excuse me. I have an important conference to attend.
Polo, you will show Mata to her room.
Please, follow me.
Mata? Allow me.
- Thank you.
- Follow me.
My battery needs recharging.
- Might be your head needs examining.
- No, I had that examined last week.
This is your mother's room. It has not been opened since she left here in 1916.
You see? Nothing has been touched.
It's a wild room.
Hey, what an enormous bed.
The German army was very large in those days.
To see you here in your mother's room brings back such happy memories.
Here.
What's all this about an important conference, hm?
A representative of Le Chiffre is coming.
Tonight.
Who is Le Chiffre?
Nobody knows.
Not even Le Chiffre.
What's the conference about then, hm?
Le Chiffre is trying to raise money by selling his unique art collection.
- Why does he need money?
- He is a compulsive gambler, that's why.
Und he is using organisation funds for his gambling!
- You mean Smersh?
- Smersh!
If he does not pay off his debts, he will be liquidated.
Liquidated? Who by?
- By them.
- You mean...?
You're so like your mother.
You're driving me mad.
- Well, you haven't got far to go.
- Come to me, my little Mata. Come!
About time you were back in your box, innit?
You must forgive me.
I lose control of myself.
- I'm a mad fool. Mad.
- You want an argument?
- Remember, forget everything I tell you.
- My lips are sealed.
- Lips! Don't say such words.
- Run along, sonny.
Le Chiffre. Mm-hm.
It's the first john
I've ever gone round with.
There you are.
I have been looking for you.
- It is little Otto.
- Who is he?
One of your mother's lovers.
We often find them lying around.
- Is he dead?
- Hard to tell. He always looked like that.
Come along, child.
The auction is about to begin.
Auction?
Tonight we are selling one of the finest art collections in Europe.
- Le Chiffre's collection.
- Who is Le Chiffre?
- The man who owns the collection.
- What collection?
- The one to be auctioned.
- Who said anything about an auction?
- You did.
- Who am l?
- Frau Hoffner.
- Never heard of her. You're insane.
- Quite insane.
- I think she's right.
Gentlemen! Please take your seats and the auction will commence.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, I am here tonight on behalf of
Le Chiffre, of whom you will have heard, to auction this unique collection of art treasures.
Are there any specific bidding instructions?
When we sit, we are bidding.
When we stand, we are not bidding.
We'll do our bidding sitting down.
When we stand up, we're not bidding.
We stand, we bid.
We no stand, we no bid.
And the British representatives?
Well, I don't know actually.
A bit of both, I suppose, really.
- Is that all right with you chaps?
- That's fine.
Very well, gentlemen.
Now then.
This is an extraordinarily embarrassing item, one of the classic blackmail items of all time.
What am I bid for this priceless picture?
£14 10s.
- 300 roubles.
- 300 roubles.
- 2 million Chinese dollars.
- 2 million Chinese dollars?
Look at this masterpiece, gentlemen.
Surely we can do better than that.
- Here, what about my fare?
- Get out!
- Here!
- Stop it!
Whatever you do, you must not let Le Chiffre raise the money.
Who are you?
I'm Carleton Towers of the FO.
- FO?
- The Foreign Office, dear.
Wait outside and keep the motor running.
- 200,000 American dollars!
- A wagonload of vodka!
- 70 million tons of rice!
- 60 tons of caviar!
- 30 million trucks!
Hey! It's war!
Hello! Hello! Get me the Pentagon!
Hello, Fenella?
I shan't be able to get back for dinner. A sort of war's broken out.
You should not have done this thing.
Now I will have to kill you.
What are you doing to me?
No!
Positive, negative -
I never know which is which.
Give me those films.
She's got the films!
Grab her! Get her! Get her!
Now look here.
- Taxi!
- Tally-ho!
I'm sorry, madam.
- Let me go! Taxi!
- Over here!
Come on!
- Good Lord! Captain Towers?
- How nice to see you.
This way!
No, no! Down. No.
- Where to, miss?
- London!
- Le Chiffre speaking.
{y:bi}- The scheme was a failure.
And also Dr Noah knows what you've been up to.
{y:bi}- What now?
- I'll just have to raise the money.
- But how?
- How? By playing baccarat.
But Le Chiffre, what about me?
{y:bi}What's going to happen to me?
Thank you.
And welcome to France, Monsieur Bond.
We don't want our little talk to be overheard. Get in the car.
Well, there's nothing to talk about, is there?
Perhaps. Perhaps not.
The point is you must not allow yourself to become involved.
Don't forget there are many people here who loathe and despise you.
I have to warn you, Bond, my instructions are that you play your game with Le Chiffre and leave immediately.
No one can be such a perverse idiot as to assault a customs official.
- It may just be natural talent, sir.
- I have to warn Vesper.
- You mean James Bond 007, sir.
- Yes, yes, yes.
{y:bi}Vesper? James Bond 007?
{y:bi}- Vesper, are you there?
- Hello, Sir James. Yes, I'm here.
{y:bi}I can't see you. Your picture's gone.
No, it hasn't. I was just getting into the bath.
Vesper, do you think
Tremble could be a double agent?
He has enough trouble being a single agent. Leave him to me.
Right. Over and out.
Mr Bond?
Missed, Mr Bond.
Yes.
I am Miss Goodthighs.
I can see that.
You've got your cork still in your bottle.
So I have. What are you going to do about it?
Stick your arm out.
The management of the Hotel Tropical send their compliments and hope you will enjoy your stay with us.
I see.
Very sexy pants you're wearing, James.
Yes, they're the new double-O-fronts.
Tell me, Miss Goodthighs, how much did you tip the porter to let you in here?
- I just showed him a little kindness.
- How much?
Not too much. He's 83.
It's a good year.
So...
What can I do for you?
The question should be what can I do for you?
- Have you got any suggestions?
- This, for one.
Tell me about yourself, James.
Well, I've had some pretty wild times in my life.
Could you move over a bit?
You're lying on my loose change.
James, I need you.
Yes, yes, yes.
Well, I can understand that, my dear.
- I want to know you better.
- You're absolutely right.
My goodness, this is strong shampoo.
This really is.
I think I'd better freshen up a bit quick.
I'll be back in five minutes.
If I'm not, start without me.

Evelyn! Evelyn!
Evelyn! Evelyn!
Evelyn! Evelyn!
Evelyn, wake up!
Evelyn, what's the matter?
- Wake up! You were drugged.
- What?
- You were drugged.
- Yes, I know I was drugged.
I put the antidote pill in. And then...
Hey, I thought those antidote pills were supposed to give me 24-hour protection.
- I've got to get Sir James Bond...
- There is no time for that.
Look at you! You're wearing your glasses and you know you're not supposed to.
James Bond doesn't wear glasses.
Yes, but l... It's just that
I like to see who I'm shooting.
There are only a few hours left before the game. Now, get freshened up.
Here, what about Miss Goodthighs?
Don't worry. I took care of her.
Now concentrate on the game.
Vesper, I've given this game a lot of thought.
When I go into that casino tonight,
I'm going to sit down opposite
Le Chiffre, look him in the eye and say...
No cards.
{y:bi}- Neuf à la banque.
- It's amazing! He never loses.
{y:bi}La banque gagne. La partie est terminée.
Quiet. Absolute silence, please.
For this experiment, I require the assistance of a young lady.
You, madam. Look me in the eyes!
And you, Georges, keep your eyes on my chips.
I present you with the levitation of the Princess Ayisha, an illusion taught to me by an ancient vegetarian in the mountain fastnesses of Tibet.
She feels no pain.
My assistants will enshroud her in this perfectly ordinary paisley shawl.
Now will you all place your hands on the table?
Now let's get the show off the ground.
Keep your hand in place, madam, and continue to ascend into thin air.
Don't take your eyes from her, not one of you.
It is by your perfect concentration that the young lady remains floating in thin air.
Excuse me, madam.
Sorry to keep you hanging around.
Monsieur. You wish to make a deposit?
- Yes.
- How much?
- £100,000 sterling.
- One hundred thou...
You can keep the case with my compliments.
Thank you, monsieur.
Could we have the name, please?
Bond. James Bond.
James B...
- James Bond?
- Yes, James Bond.
Yes. James Bond.
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to sign my autograph book.
It's not for me, you understand.
It's my little sister.
I wonder if you'd be kind enough to put your autograph on that receipt for the £100,000 sterling.
But of course, Mr Bond.
It's not for me, it's for somebody else.
- Now what happens?
- We go to the casino director's office.
Point me. Just point me.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Just a bit different from the Buckingham Club, that's all.
- Bond has arrived.
- Bond is here. All staff on the alert.
Come in.
Ah! Hello. How nice to see you again.
- May I introduce...
- We have met.
Mr Slymington-Jones, Mr James Bond.
How do you do?
Do make yourself comfortable.
I see you've put a tiger in your office.
Yes. I have several actually.
That one that you so cleverly spotted, the head on the wall over there, and the one you're about to trip over.
Do be careful.
Yes.
The man in the white coat is Le Chiffre.
Don't be afraid. It's a one-way mirror.
- Which way?
- That way.
- No card.
- No card.
{y:bi}Neuf à la banque.
Mr Bond, you can watch
Le Chiffre better on here.
He's bought the bank for the evening, and he's winning consistently.
And showing off with his magic throughout.
- Why the dark glasses?
- Here.
So if Le Chiffre wears the same kind of glasses, he knows every card on the table.
- Infrared glasses.
- The cheat!
Listen, Evelyn.
You win and he will almost certainly be killed by his organisation.
- But he'd try and avoid that, wouldn't he?
- If you win, yes.
- How?
- By trying to kill you.
- As in dead?
- Yes. But don't worry about that now.
Let's go down there and you play the game of your life.
Yes, I better had. There may not be too much more of it left.
- Vesper...
- Don't worry. I'll take care of you.
- Well, then. It's all under control now.
- I hope so.
- Well, excuse me.
- Willingly.
{y:bi}Messieurs, faites vos jeux.
I believe you have my name in a crevice. James Bond.
{y:bi}- Pardon, monsieur?
- Bond. James Bond.
Oh, yes, Mr Bond.
Bond? James Bond?
The name is familiar.
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
- I'm flattered you've heard of me.
- I have heard of you, but not as an expert on baccarat.
Well, I'm sorry you weren't told.
Don't think that went unnoticed, Mr Bond.
I see everything that goes on at this table.
- Nothing escapes me.
- I'm quite sure it doesn't.
But we mustn't forget that the beggar who is in the marketplace is completely deaf insomuch as far as listening to the song that is coming from the mockingbird is concerned.
I'm sorry, Mr Bond,
I don't get the connection.
You will.
Sim salabim.
When you're quite ready.
Now I require a perfectly ordinary gentleman's pocket handkerchief.
From the pocket of one perfectly ordinary gentleman.
That's the kind of remark that leads to war.
How much better for all humanity if all the nations could learn to live together in peace.
Marvellous!
More!
That's finished, is it?
Fantastic. Wonderful. Incredible.
Incredible, isn't it? Absolutely marvellous.
I've never seen anything like it.
And now if you're ready, Monsieur
Le Chiffre, I would like to play baccarat.
- I use the Evelyn Tremble method.
- You read Tremble.
I thought he'd only published a few paperback editions.
Well, I have an autographed first edition.
It's a bit dog-eared now, mind you, but it nevertheless has a certain...
Uninformed quality?
{y:bi}Six à la ponte et neuf à la banque.
{y:bi}La banque gagne.
Aren't you a little out of your depth, Mr Bond?
In the last 20 minutes I have ruined two Greeks and a maharajah.
You know, Mr Bond, we aren't playing for marbles.
The night is young and the rose garden is already littered with my victims.
Yes, but the beggar in marketplace are deaf to song of nightingale.
- You amuse me, Mr Bond.
- I'm glad you're enjoying me.
Shall we double the bank?
If it'll improve your game.
{y:bi}Pas de cartes.
No card.
{y:bi}- Sept à la banque.
- He never loses!
{y:bi}Cinq à la ponte. La banque gagne.
What about one for the road?
It looks as though luck isn't on your side of the road, old man.
She has a habit of moving around.
Then we might as well double the bank again.
Suppose I were to treble it?
Treble it? You haven't any chips!
I think my credit's good.
Bond credit good.
The bank now stands at 50 million francs.
Very well.
Goodbye, Mr Bond.
It's been nice knowing you.
{y:bi}Pas de cartes.
No card.
- Baccarat.
- He lost!
{y:bi}La ponte gagne.
Goodbye, Monsieur Le Chiffre.
It was nice knowing you.
Let's not say goodbye, Mr Bond.
Let's just say au revoir.
- Lovely!
- Credit my account, would you?
{y:bi}La partie est terminée.
- A remarkable performance, Mr Bond.
- Thank you. Trifle unusual but...
- How would you like the money?
- A cheque in a Swiss bank.
- Would you like the cheque now?
- Yes, now, yes.
I'll tell the cashier.
You can pick it up as you go out.
- Excuse me.
- Willingly.
Mr Bond, what are your movements for the rest of the evening?
We thought we'd have a bite to eat and then back to the hotel.
And you're leaving Royale first thing in the morning.
Are we?
The inspector isn't asking us.
He's telling us.
A police car will escort you from the hotel to the airport.
- Mr Mathis.
- Yes?
Something's been worrying me.
You're a French police officer and yet you have a Scots accent.
Aye. It worries me, too.
Haven't by any chance seen a young lady in a green dress?
Would that be a lady with a black bag over her head being manhandled by two unsavoury gentlemens?
- Could very well be.
- She went that way, sir.
In a car. A very fast car!
- Moss?
- Yes, sir.
- Follow that car!
- Yes, sir.
I'll use Fangio next time. Idiot!
Grand Prix enthusiasts may be worried by the time it's taken me to get into this Lotus Formula Three.
They don't realise that although Le Chiffre thinks he has a faster car than me,
I am faster in my Lotus Formula Three!
Wake up, Mr Bond. Wake up.
Well, now, Mr Bond. You've had your little victory at the baccarat table.
Now it's my turn. I'm going to have to have that cheque, Mr Bond.
Smersh is going to be very unhappy.
- You mean you're going to torture me?
- Persuade you, Mr Bond. Persuade you.
Don't worry about that chair with the hole.
It's merely waiting to be reupholstered.
- By me.
- You have an inventive mind, Mr Bond.
But my methods are much more subtle.
They have to be.
- What are you going to do?
- Physically, I'm not going to do anything.
Oh, you're going to nothing me to death.
Torture of the mind. The most exquisite torture is all in the mind.
{y:bi}I'm going to have to
{y:bi}have that cheque, Mr Bond.
Suppose Mr Bond isn't ready to give it to you?
{y:bi}You are a tiresome little man.
{y:bi}Let's try another approach.
{y:bi}It's a beauty contest, Mr Bond.
{y:bi}You're supposed to pick the winner.
- Excuse me. Are you Richard Burton?
- No, I'm Peter O'Toole.
Then you're the finest man that ever breathed.
- God bless you, sir.
- Thank you.
You've changed my plans, Miss Lynd.
But neither you nor Bond will leave here till I get that cheque!
Mr Tremble?
Never trust a rich spy.
{y:bi}Le Chiffre, you're a fool. Smersh
{y:bi}believed you could win at baccarat.
- All I need is 24 hours!
{y:bi}- It's too late.
Oh, Daddy, I do so long to meet him.
All the girls do. He really turns me on.
- Did that finishing school teach you that?
- No, I taught them.
Now run along and watch the Changing of the Guard.
- I bet Mummy would have taken me in.
- Mummy took everyone in.
Put me down! Put me down!!
- What is it, a film?
- It must be a commercial.
No time for window-gazing, Moneypenny.
Mata's been kidnapped.
- But...
- That's an unidentified flying object.
And our fastest jets trying to track it down. Control?
- That's the canteen.
- Control!
Contact all operatives.
We must find out where it lands.
- Air Ministry. They've lost it.
- Lost it? You were right on its tail.
Well, you must have one plane fast enough... I see.
They stopped building those last week.
I wonder if you'd care to help us.
- Could you come back...
- Do please come in, Sister.
It's our annual collection for needy girls.
Your receipt?
This department has always been very helpful to needy girls.
That's strange.
We've never had a receipt before.
"They're taking your daughter to Casino Royale. Sister McTarry."
The Prime Minister, urgently.
Daddy'll come after me.
- That's what we're hopin'.
- You won't get away with this.
{y:bi}Move to the door, Mata Bond.
{y:bi}You are a prisoner of Smersh.
{y:bi}We already have most of your father's
{y:bi}agents here. You will complete the set.
- Looks like a Smersh convention.
- Le directeur wishes to see you.
- It is about your daughter.
- Tactic 4B if necessary.
I will tell him you are here.
Hold it! Back up.
Face the curtains!
March!
{y:bi}You are now entering
{y:bi}the Smersh headquarters of Dr Noah.
Tactic 33A.
Now!
{y:bi}Operation James Bond completed.
Dr Noah, I presume.
Why don't you come out and face me?
{y:bi}Because you are going to
{y:bi}come in and face me.
Sir!
Moneypenny!
{y:bi}This is an historic day
{y:bi}in our saga, Sir James.
{y:bi}The day Smersh finally eliminated
{y:bi}the original James Bond.
{y:bi}- His world will soon follow.
- This is all very impressive.
{y:bi}You might be even more impressed
{y:bi}to meet one of my 1,000 doubles.
{y:bi}Waiting for the moment when
{y:bi}I command them to take over the world.
It's fantastic. May I take a closer look?
{y:bi}It's quite perfect.
- Good Lord! It's my nephew.
- Jimmy Bond?
This explains the Caribbean assignment.
Is this some kind of a joke?
- He can't speak!
- Never could in my presence.
Psychological block he's had since childhood, based on hero worship.
- He's Dr Noah?
- My nephew the head of Smersh?
I have been bombed, bullied and baited out of retirement to deal with you?
- Do you suppose he's a junkie?
- Leave this to me.
Now, Jimmy, as your uncle
I really must insist...
- What is it?
- He's put a sheet of glass between us.
I never should have let Nellie send him to progressive school.
What's that?
Dr Noah's bacillus? Now, Jimmy, even you wouldn't release germ warfare.
{y:bi}Handle these capsules with care.
{y:bi}Dr Noah's bacillus is highly contagious.
{y:bi}When distributed in the atmosphere
{y:bi}it will make all women beautiful
{y:bi}and destroy all men over 4ft 6.
{y:bi}- Please handle these capsules with care.
- So that's your plan, huh?
A world full of beautiful women and all men shorter than yourself.
Good evening. All this just to make up for your feeling of sexual inferiority?
I'm beginning to think you're a trifle neurotic.
Maybe you can explain. Why was I abducted and subjected to this?
Because, of all Uncle James's 007s, you're the most beautiful and desirable.
Do you treat all the girls you desire this way?
Yes! I undress them and tie them up.
I learned that in the Boy Scouts.
Let me ask you a question.
Do I appear menacing to you at all?
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing. I just think...
Did you see yourself in the mirror lately?
I think you should.
You are a wretched, grotesque, ridiculous, insignificant little monster.
Are you saying to me that you find
Uncle James more attractive than I am?
Uncle James? He's a real man. Wow!
Do you realise that anything
Uncle James can do I can do better?
That will be the day.
You're crazy. You are absolutely crazy.
- They called Einstein crazy.
- No one ever called Einstein crazy.
- They would have if he behaved like this.
- People respected Einstein.
Einstein could never have conceived of something like this.
It looks like an aspirin, it tastes like an aspirin, but it's not an aspirin.
- It's cyanide.
- This pill contains 400 tiny time pills.
They go off in the body, forming a chain reaction, and turn the person into a walking atomic bomb.
Einstein's bomb was crude.
This is brilliant.
It's crude to tie up women.
In a week it'll be
April Fools' Day, my birthday.
All world leaders will be assassinated and my doubles will take their places.
In five days' time
I'll be ruler of the Earth.
- How would you like to be my co-ruler?
- Why not?
- Why not? You hate me.
- I don't know.
I'm beginning to wonder if the real genius of the Bond family is not right here in the room with me now.
- Why don't you unlock me?
- Yes, I will.
I'll unlock you immediately and we'll run amok.
If you're too tired, we'll walk amok.
I'm so sorry for all the things I said.
I didn't really mean it.
- Here. Slip into this.
- Just a moment. Be careful.
Yes. I don't want to damage any of your parts.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Now, turn yourself like a nice fool while I slip this on.
Yes. Yes, I'll wait over here.
This'll show Sir James once and for all which of us has the perfect body.
The poor boob! Hurry, my dear.
I have great plans for us.
It's vaporised lysergic acid.
It's highly explosive.
{y:bi}You are now entering
{y:bi}Dr Noah's personal aircraft
{y:bi}where our beloved leader
{y:bi}has assembled a collection
{y:bi}of the world's
{y:bi}most distinguished doubles.
Dr Noah's jet orbital space plane welcomes you aboard.
A great likeness, isn't she?
I copied her right down to the last...
The two of us have had some profoundly moving religious experiences.
How do you like this place? I had a decorator help me, but I worked with her.
{y:bi}Your leader
{y:bi}has remoulded ordinary agents
{y:bi}into replicas of the world's greatest
{y:bi}figures in culture, politics and the arts.
- Look! They're uncovered!
- These are not doubles.
These are the real people. I've already substituted my robots for them.
At this very minute the world is being ruled by duplicates under my control.
Well, that explains a lot of things.
Your rain-cooled Taittinger, sir.
The drink!
And for you.
Think of it. A world free of poverty and pestilence and war.
A world where all men are created equal.
Where a man, no matter how short, can score with a top broad.
Where each man, regardless of race, creed, colour, gets free dental work and a chance of subscription-buying all the good things in life.
But, Noah, you are for all this?
No, no. I'm against all this.
I love politics!
- To your future.
- I'll drink to that.
My very special champagne.
- With your very special pill in it.
- What are you talking about?
It looks like an aspirin, it tastes like an aspirin, but it isn't an aspirin.
- And you just swallowed it.
- You're lying.
398 more of those little pills to go off.
Have a real bomb of an evening!
Alka Seltzer!
Right?
Charge!
Delightful vintage, sir.
- Smooth to the palate.
Here. There's a fish in my mixture. You fool!
I say! Super place for a coming-out party.
Now now, Mata.
- Through here!
- Down!
Look! Quick, before the fuse burns out.
Try not to look conspicuous.
- Good Lord! It's one of ours.
- Sir!
- We've got to get out before he blows up!
- We've got to find that office.
- What office?
- The one we came down in, of course.
Leave this to me.
Where's the office? The office.
Come on! Quick.
That's very civil of you, sir. Thank you.
- Come on, give me a hand.
- Look out!
Follow me!
Charge!
Mata, put your finger in the tiger's ear. It works the doors.
- Good.
- What's the strategy, sir?
Get out of the bloody place before it blows up.
- Everybody stay close behind me.
- I'm not chancing that casino again.
- I'd rather slide down a drainpipe.
- Beautiful, but no stamina.
Get the girls out the back way.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
Good heavens, Daddy.
I couldn't have enjoyed it more.
Over there.
Clear the building.
It's liable to blow up.
I want London. Whitehall double 0, 07.
Too bad you won't get it, Sir James.
I went through a lot of trouble to bring you here.
Dear Vesper.
The things you do for money.
This time it's for love, Sir James.
- Don't expect...
- Back to the office.
The American aid, sir. It's arrived.
Geronimo!
- Glad we could be of help, sir.
- Good Lord! Ransome, isn't it?
A-OK, Sir James. CIC at CIA.
Don't start all that again.
I haven't worked out your last lot yet.
- As you were saying, sir?
- A-OK, Ransome. A-OK.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
{y:bi}- Les Français sont arrivés.
- Pardon?
{y:bi}- Les Français sont là.
- Sorry, my French is rather rusty.
- The French have arrived.
- Splendid. Thank you.
Look out!
{y:bi}- Merde!
- What? Look in the book.
- Ouch.
- This way.
Police!
I've been framed.
This gun shoots backwards.
I just killed myself.
18. Wait!
Four.
Three. Two.

He was the most extraordinary man
I ever knew.
Did you know him well?
I knew him.
Well, nil nisi bonum.
But did he really deserve...
...a place in here?
Lord Allenby, could you give a few words about Lawrence?
What, more words?
The revolt in the desert...
...played a decisive part in the Middle Eastern campaign.
Yes, sir, but about
Colonel Lawrence himself.
No, no. I didn't know him well, you know.
Mr. Bentley, you know as much about Lawrence as anybody.
Yes, it was my privilege to know him.
And to make him known to the world.
He was a poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior.
Thank you.
He was also the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.
You, sir. Who are you?
My name is Jackson Bentley.
I overheard your last remark and take the gravest exception.
- He was a great man.
- Did you know him?
No, I can't claim to have known him.
I had the honour to shake his hand in Damascus.
Knew him? I never knew him.
He had some minor function on my staff in Cairo.
Michael George Hartley...
...this is a nasty, dark little room.
That's right.
We are not happy in it.
I am. It's better than a nasty, dark little trench.
- Then you're a big noble fellow.
- That's right.
Here is William Potter with my newspaper.
- Here you are, tosh.
- Thanks.
Would you care for one of
Corporal Hartley's cigarettes?
- Is it there?
- Of course.
Headlines.
But I bet it isn't mentioned in the Times.
"Bedouin tribes attack
Turkish stronghold."
I bet that no one in this headquarters even knows it happened.
Or would care if it did.
Allow me to ignite your cigarette.
- Mr. Lawrence?
- Yes.
- Flimsy, sir.
- Thank you.
You'll do that once too often.
It's only flesh and blood.
Michael George Hartley, you're a philosopher.
And you're balmy!
- It damn well hurts!
- Certainly, it hurts.
What's the trick, then?
The trick, William Potter, is not minding that it hurts.
By the way, if Captain Gibbon should enquire for me...
...tell him I've gone for a chat with the general.
- He's balmy.
- He's all right.
Lawrence.
Yes?
You're supposed to be...
Do you usually wear your cap in the mess?
Always.
You should be on duty.
Where are you going?
Mustn't talk shop,
Freddie, not in the mess.
I'm going for a powwow with the general.
I'm not asking as your superior, but as the secretary of this mess.
We don't want chaps in here who should be on duty.
Where are you going?
I must say, Lawrence!
- Sorry.
- You're a clown, Lawrence.
Ah, well, we can't all be lion tamers.
Sorry.
It's an intrigue, Dryden.
I do not propose to let an overweening, crass lieutenant...
...thumb his nose at his commander and get away with it.
It doesn't sound as though he'd be any great loss, sir.
Don't try that, Dryden.
There's a principle involved.
There is, indeed.
He's of no use here in Cairo.
He might be in Arabia.
He knows his stuff, sir.
Knows the books, you mean.
I've already sent out
Colonel Brighton, who's a soldier.
If Brighton thinks we should send some arms, we will.
Well, what more do you want?
That there would be no question of Lieutenant Lawrence...
...giving military advice.
By God, I should hope not.
It's just that the Arab Bureau would like its own man on the spot to...
To what?
To make our own appraisal of the situation.
I'll tell you, it's my considered opinion and that of my staff...
...that time spent on the Bedouin will be time wasted.
They're a nation of sheep-stealers.
They did attack Medina.
And the Turks made mincemeat of them.
We don't know that.
We know that they didn't take it.
A storm in a teacup, a sideshow.
In my opinion, this whole theatre of operations is a sideshow.
The real war's being fought against
Germans, not Turks.
Not here, but on the Western front in the trenches.
Your Bedouin Army, or whatever it calls itself...
...would be a sideshow of a sideshow.
Big things have small beginnings, sir.
Does the Arab Bureau want a big thing in Arabia?
Does the bureau think they'll sit down under us when this war is over?
The bureau thinks the job of the moment, sir, is to win the war.
Don't tell me my duty, Mr. Dryden.
- Lawrence, sir.
- Send him in.
Good morning, sir.
Salute.
If you're insubordinate,
I shall put you under arrest.
- It's my manner.
- Your what?
My manner. It looks insubordinate, but it isn't.
I can't make out whether you're bad-mannered or just half-witted.
- I have the same problem, sir.
- Shut up.
The Arab Bureau thinks you would be of use to them in Arabia.
Why, I can't imagine.
You can't perform your present duties properly.
"I cannot fiddle, but I can make a great state from a little city."
- What?
- Themistocles, sir.
- A Greek philosopher.
- I know you've been well-educated.
It says so in your dossier.
You're the kind of creature
I can't stand, Lawrence.
But I suppose I could be wrong.
All right, Dryden.
You can have him for six weeks.
Who knows? It might even make a man of him. Come in!
Yes, what is it?
The convoy will be in
Port Said tomorrow night.
- Is that certain?
- Yes, sir.
There doesn't seem to be any artillery.
But there must be artillery!
Sir, this is something of an expedition.
He has to get to Yenbo, find a guide, find the Arabs and then get back.
He can't do that in six weeks.
- Two months, then.
- Three.
All right, three. Now, will you let me do some work, Mr. Dryden?
Thank you, sir.
I'd like to say, sir, that I am grateful for this.
Shut up and get out.
Sir?
How can I fight a bloody war without bloody artillery?
- How did you do it?
- Might better ask why I bothered to.
- Because I'm the man for the job.
- I just wonder about that.
Of course I am.
What is the job, by the way?
Find Prince Feisal.
Good. And when I've found him?
Find out what kind of a man he is.
Find out what his intentions are.
Not his immediate intentions.
That is Colonel Brighton's business, not yours.
I mean, his intentions in Arabia altogether.
That's new.
Where are they now?
Anywhere within 300 miles of Medina.
They're Hashemite Bedouins.
They can cross 60 miles of desert in a day.
Thanks. This is going to be fun.
Lawrence, only two kinds of creature get fun in the desert:
Bedouins and gods, and you're neither. Take it from me.
For ordinary men, it's a burning fiery furnace.
No, Dryden. It's going to be fun.
It is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun.
Here you may drink.
One cup.
You do not drink?
No.
I'll drink when you do.
I am Bedu.
Truly, now, you are a British officer?
Yes.
From Cairo?
Yes.
- You did not ride from Cairo?
- No.
Thank heaven. It's 900 miles.
I came by boat.
And before?
From Britain?
Yes.
Truly?
From Oxfordshire.
Is that a desert country?
No. A fat country. Fat people.
You are not fat?
No.
I'm different.
Here...
...take it.
First I take you to Lord Feisal, then you give it to me.
Take it now.
Bedu food.
Good.
More?
- Bedu.
- Where?
From here to Lord Feisal's camp is Harith country.
Yes, I know.
- I am not Harith.
- No.
Hazimi, of the Beni Salem.
Put the right foot in tight.
Lock it with your left foot.
When you are ready to go...
...hit her on the shoulder and say, "Hut-hut-hut."
Today will be difficult, but tomorrow, good riding.
I think we reach Masturah Well tomorrow. Yes.
And from Masturah Well to
Lord Feisal's camp, one day more.
Now!
Good?
It's all right.
This is a Harith well.
The Harith are a dirty people.
Turks?
Bedu.
Who is he?
He is dead.
Yes.
Why?
This is my well.
I have drunk from it.
You are welcome.
He was my friend.
- That?
- Yes, that.
- This pistol yours?
- No, his.
His?
Mine.
Then I will use it.
Your friend...
...was a Hazimi of the Beni Salem.
I know.
I am Ali ibn el Kharish.
I have heard of you.
So...
...what was a Hazimi doing here?
He was taking me to help
Prince Feisal.
- You've been sent from Cairo.
- Yes.
I have been in Cairo for my schooling.
I can both read and write.
My Lord Feisal already has an Englishman.
What is your name?
My name is for my friends.
None of my friends is a murderer.
You are angry, English.
He was nothing.
The well is everything.
The Hazimi may not drink at our wells.
He knew that.
Salaam.
Sherif Ali.
So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe...
...so long will they be a little people...
...a silly people.
Greedy, barbarous and cruel, as you are.
Come.
I will take you to Feisal.
I do not want your company, sherif.
Wadi Safra is another day from here.
You will not find it, and you will die.
I will find it with this.
Good army compass.
How if I take it?
Then you would be a thief.
Have you no fear, English?
My fear is my concern.
Truly.
God be with you, English.
As I walk along the Bois de Boulogne
With an independent air
You can hear the girls declare
He must be a millionaire
I'm the man who broke the bank
At Monte Carlo
Hey, you!
- I've been waiting for you.
- Did you know I was coming?
I knew someone was coming.
Feisal told me.
How did he know?
Not much happens within 50 miles of Feisal that he doesn't know.
I'll give him that. No escort?
My guide was killed at the Masturah Well.
- Turks?
- No, an Arab.
Bloody savages.
- This is Wadi Safra, isn't it?
- Yes, they're over there.
Just a minute.
What's your name and who sent you?
Lawrence. I've been seconded to the Arab Bureau.
What are you to do for the Arab Bureau?
Well, it's rather vague, sir.
I'm to appreciate the situation.
Well, that won't be difficult.
The situation's bloody awful.
Their morale, if they ever had any, which I doubt...
...the Turks knocked out of them in front of Medina, with howitzers.
They're fading away by dozens every night.
What I want to say is this:
Wherever you are and whoever you are with...
...you're a British officer.
Here's an order.
When we get into that camp, you're to keep your mouth shut.
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- I understand what you're saying.
You'll make your appreciation and get back to...
Oh, my God.
Not again.
I've told him!
God knows I've told him.
"Move South," I've said.
"You're still in range."
They simply will not understand what modern weapons do!
Stand and fight. Stand and fight.
Fire back at them.
- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Lawrence, sir.
Seconded to the Arab Bureau.
This is a bloody mess, sir.
We'll have to move south.
Yes, colonel, 50 miles south.
You were right and I was wrong.
We must take some thought for the wounded.
- We can take care of them at Yenbo.
- Lf they can get to Yenbo.
They can hardly come with us.
No. They must try to reach Yenbo.
Lieutenant?
Lawrence.
You understand,
Lieutenant Lawrence...
...my people are unused to explosives and machines.
First the guns, and now this.
Cigarette?
I'm sorry.
Cigarette, Your Excellency?
Umph off.
Please, Your Excellency.
Just one for two?
Hold it, Jenkins!
Jenkins!
Lawrence?
You have no servant.
- I don't need a servant.
- No?
We can do everything. Light fires, cook food, wash clothes.
- Yes, everything.
- I don't doubt it.
- It will be very nice for you.
- I can't afford it.
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may be easy to you.
Recite, then, as much of the Koran as may be easy to you.
God knoweth that there be some among you sick...
...while others travel through the
Earth in quest for the bounties of God.
Others do battle in His cause.
Recite, therefore, as much as may be easy.
And observe the prayers.
This will be best and richest in the recompense.
Seek ye the forgiveness of God.
Verily, God is forgiving, merciful...
Greetings, Ali.
- My lord.
- Sherif Ali.
Lieutenant Lawrence, you have met
Sherif Ali, I think.
Yes, my lord.
And now, Selim, "The Brightness."
"By the noonday brightness...
...and by the night when it darkeneth...
...thy Lord hath not forsaken thee...
...neither hath He been displeased.
And surely the future shall be better for thee than the past."
"And in the end shall your Lord be bounteous to thee...
...and thou be satisfied."
So?
Yes, colonel.
- I want a decision, sir.
- You want me to fall back on Yenbo.
Well, you're not doing much good here, sir.
I'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we can't supply you here.
You could supply us through Aqaba!
Aqaba!
If you can get ahold of Aqaba, we can supply you.
- But you can't!
- You could.
You mean, the navy?
The Turks have 12-inch guns at Aqaba, sir.
Can you imagine what that means?
Yes, I can imagine.
Put that out of your mind, sir.
The navy's got other things to do.
Oh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.
The one essential sector of this front is and must be the canal.
You can see that, sir, surely.
I see that the canal is an essential British interest.
It is of little consequence to us.
I must ask you not to speak like that.
British and Arab interests are one and the same.
Possibly.
Upon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.
Fall back on Yenbo and we will give you equipment.
Give you arms, advice, training, everything.
- Guns?
- A modern rifle for every man.
No. Guns. Artillery.
Guns like the Turkish guns at Medina.
Yes, give us guns and keep the training.
Your men need training far more than guns, sir.
English will teach
Bedu to fight?
We will teach them, Sherif Ali, to fight a modern mechanized army.
Yes, lieutenant?
What do you think about Yenbo?
I think it is far from Damascus.
We'll have you in Damascus, sir.
Never fear.
Have you been in Damascus,
Mr. Lawrence?
Yes, my lord.
It is beautiful, is it not?
- Very.
- That will do, Lawrence.
Dreaming won't get you to Damascus, but discipline will.
Look, Great Britain is a small country, much smaller than yours.
Small population compared with some.
It's small, but it's great. And why?
- Because it has guns.
- Because it has discipline.
Because it has a navy, because of this...
...the English go where they please...
...and strike where they please.
This makes them great.
- Right.
- Mr. Lawrence, that will do!
Lawrence is not your military adviser.
But I would like to hear his opinion.
Damn it!
Who do you take your orders from?
From Lord Feisal, in Feisal's tent.
Old fool! Why turn from him to him?
They are master and man.
My lord, I think...
I think your book is right.
The desert is an ocean in which no oar is dipped.
On this ocean, the Bedu go where they please...
...and strike where they please.
This is the way the Bedu has always fought.
You're famed through the world for fighting this way.
And this is the way you should fight now.
I don't know.
I'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong.
Fall back on Yenbo, the Arab Rising becomes one unit in the British army.
- What is this to you?
- You're a traitor.
No, colonel.
He is a young man, and young men are passionate.
They must say their say.
But wiser people must decide.
I know you are right.
Very well. When shall we move?
The sooner the better.
You'll lose another 50 men tonight.
You tread heavily...
...but you speak the truth.
I will give you my answer tomorrow.
And now...
...it is late.
Colonel Brighton means to put my men...
...under European officers, does he not?
In effect, my lord, yes.
And I must do it...
...because the Turks have
European guns.
But I fear to do it...
...upon my soul I do.
The English have a great hunger for desolate places.
I fear they hunger for Arabia.
Then you must deny it to them.
You are an Englishman.
Are you not loyal to England?
To England and to other things.
To England and Arabia both?
And is that possible?
I think you are another of these desert-Ioving English.
Doughty, Stanhope...
...Gordon of Khartoum.
No Arab loves the desert.
We love water and green trees.
There is nothing in the desert.
And no man needs nothing.
Or is it that you think we are something you can play with...
...because we are a little people, a silly people...
...greedy, barbarous and cruel?
Or do you know, lieutenant, in the Arab city of Cordoba...
...were two miles of lighting in the streets...
...when London was a village.
Yes, you were great.
Nine centuries ago.
Time to be great again, my lord.
Which is why my father made this war upon the Turks.
My father, Mr. Lawrence, not the English.
But my father is old...
...and I...
...I long for the vanished gardens of Cordoba.
However, before the gardens must come the fighting.
To be great again, it seems that we need the English...
...or...
Or?
What no man can provide,
Mr. Lawrence.
We need a miracle.
Aqaba.
Aqaba.
From the land.
You are mad.
To come to Aqaba by land we should have to cross the Nefud Desert.
That's right.
The Nefud cannot be crossed.
I'll cross it if you will.
You? It takes more than a compass,
Englishman.
The Nefud is the worst place
God created.
I can't answer for the place.
Only for myself.
Fifty men?
Fifty? Against Aqaba?
If 50 men came out of the Nefud...
...they would be 50 men other men might join.
The Howeitat are there, I hear.
The Howeitat are brigands.
They'll sell themselves to anyone.
- Good fighters, though.
- Good...
Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.
They face the sea, Sherif Ali, and cannot be turned around.
From the landward side, there are no guns at Aqaba.
With good reason. It cannot be approached from the landward side.
Certainly the Turks don't dream of it.
Aqaba's over there.
It's only a matter of going.
You are mad.
And where are you going, lieutenant?
With 50 of my men.
To work your miracle.
Blasphemy is a bad beginning for such a journey.
- Who told you?
- Ali did.
Why not you?
You are falling back from Yenbo, sir?
Yes, I must.
But I will spare these to you.
Did Ali break confidence to tell me?
Sherif Ali owes you his allegiance, my lord.
Yet you did not tell
Colonel Brighton.
No.
Since you do know...
...we can claim to arrive in the name of Feisal of Mecca.
Yes, Lieutenant Lawrence, you may claim it.
But in whose name do you ride?
Sherif, I caught them.
They have tracked us.
They were here. I caught them.
Why are you here? Boy!
To serve Lord Lawrence, sherif.
This is true, Lawrence.
They do wish it.
You have been tracking us.
- You were told to stay.
- No, sherif.
Our camel strayed. We followed her.
She led us here to be
Lord Lawrence's servants.
- It is the will of Allah.
- Blasphemy.
Don't do that.
No, Lawrence, these are not servants.
These are outcasts, parent-less.
Be warned. They are not suitable.
They sound very suitable.
You can ride with the baggage.
These are not servants.
These are worshippers.
One shilling, every week?
That is fair.
- Each?
- No.
- That is too much.
- All right.
They will be lucky for you.
Allah favours the compassionate.
There is the railway.
And that is the desert.
From here until the other side, no water but what we carry.
For the camels, no water at all.
If the camels die...
...we die.
And in 20 days they will start to die.
There's no time to waste, then, is there?
I was thinking.
You were drifting.
Yes. It will not happen again.
Be warned, you were drifting.
It will not happen again.
That water is wasted.
From now on, we must travel by night...
...and rest while it is too hot to travel.
A few hours each day.
Why don't we start now?
No. We will rest now.
Three hours.
Fine.
I'll wake you.
Do we rest here?
There is no rest now short of water.
The other side of that.
And how much of that is there?
I'm not sure.
But however much, it must be crossed before tomorrow's sun gets up.
This is the sun's anvil.
Have we done it?
No, but we're off the anvil.
Thank God for that anyway.
Yes, thank Him.
Lawrence, I do not think you know how you have tempted Him.
I know.
We've done it.
God willing.
When do we reach the wells?
God willing, midday.
- Then we've done it.
- Thank Him, Lawrence. Thank Him.
Gasim's.
What's happened to him?
God knows.
Why don't you stop?
For what? He will be dead by midday.
We must go back.
What for, to die with Gasim?
In one hour comes the sun.
In God's name, understand!
We cannot go back!
I can.
Take the boys.
If you go back, you kill yourself, is all.
Gasim you have killed already.
Get out of my way.
Gasim's time is come, Lawrence.
It is written.
Nothing is written!
Go back, then!
What did you bring us here for with your blasphemous conceit?
English blasphemer!
Aqaba?
Was it Aqaba?
You will not be at Aqaba, English!
Go back, blasphemer...
...but you will not be at Aqaba.
I shall be at Aqaba.
That is written.
In here.
English!
English!
Lawrence! Daud!
Nothing is written.
Al Lawrence.
Farraj.
Wash.
Al Lawrence.
Truly, for some men nothing is written unless they write it.
Not Al Lawrence. Just Lawrence.
- AI Lawrence is better.
- True.
Your father too, just Mr. Lawrence?
My father is Sir Thomas Chapman.
- Is that a lord?
- A kind of lord.
Then when he dies, you too will be a lord.
No.
You have an elder brother.
But then, I do not understand this.
Your father's name is Chapman.
He didn't marry my mother.
I see.
I'm sorry.
It seems to me that you are free to choose your own name, then.
Yes, I suppose I am.
Al Lawrence is best.
All right, I'll settle for
Al Lawrence.
They are the robes of a sherif of the Beni Wejh.
Very fine.
- Great honour.
- The honour is to us. Salaam, sherif.
- Is it permitted?
- Surely.
He for whom nothing is written may write himself a clan.
They are good for riding. Try.
What are you doing, Englishman?
As you see.
Are you alone?
Almost.
Are you with those dogs drinking at my well?
Yours?
I am Auda Abu Tayi.
I've heard of another man of that name.
Other? What other?
The Auda I'd heard of wouldn't need to summon help to look after his wells.
He must be a great hero.
He is.
He wouldn't refuse water to men coming out of Nefud Desert.
Now, would he not?
No, that must be some other man.
Here is my help.
Son, what fashion is this?
- Harith, Father.
- What manner of Harith?
A Beni Wejh sherif.
And is he Harith?
No, Father, English.
Son...
...they are stealing our water.
Tell them we are coming.
Tell them.
- Empty that!
- Do not!
It is Auda of the Howeitat who speaks.
It is Ali of the Harith who answers.
Harith.
Ali.
Does your father still steal?
No.
Does Auda take me for one of his own bastards?
No. There is no resemblance.
Alas, you resemble your father.
- Auda flatters me.
- You are easily flattered.
I knew your father well.
Did you know your own?
We are 50, you are two.
How if we shot you down?
Why, then you have a blood feud with the Howeitat.
- Do you desire it?
- Not the generals in Cairo...
...nor the sultan himself desire that.
Call off your men.
This honours the unworthy.
I've only just begun to teach him.
And what are you teaching him today?
Howeitat hospitality?
Be not clever with me, English.
- Who is he?
- A friend of Prince Feisal's.
- So you desire my hospitality?
- Yes.
Is he your tongue?
We do desire it.
Then it is given, if you will take it.
I'm at my summer camp, a poor place.
Well, to me it seems a poor place.
Some men find it marvellous.
Tomorrow, maybe I will allow the
Turks to buy you, friends of Feisal.
But...
...dine with me.
Dine with Auda, English.
Dine with the Howeitat, Harith.
It is my pleasure that you dine with me in Wadi Rumm!
This thing you work against Aqaba...
...what profit do you hope from it?
We work it for Feisal of Mecca.
The Harith do not work for profit.
Well, if it is in a man to be a servant, Sherif Ali...
...he could find worse masters than Feisal.
But I...
I cannot serve.
You permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.
Yes, it is my pleasure.
We do not work this thing for Feisal.
No?
- For the English, then?
- For the Arabs.
The Arabs?
The Howeitat, Ageyil, Ruala,
Beni Sahkr, these I know.
I have even heard of the Harith.
But the Arabs?
What tribe is that?
They're a tribe of slaves.
They serve the Turks.
Well, they are nothing to me.
My tribe is the Howeitat.
Who work only for profit.
Who work at Auda's pleasure.
And Auda's pleasure is to serve the Turks.
Serve?
I serve?
It is the servant who takes money.
I am Auda Abu Tayi.
- Does Auda serve?
- No!
- Does Auda Abu Tayi serve?
- No!
I carry 23 great wounds, all got in battle.
75 men have I killed with my own hands, in battle.
I scatter, I burn my enemies tents.
I take away their flocks and herds.
The Turks pay me a golden treasure, yet I am poor!
Because I am a river to my people.
Is that service?
No.
And yet now it seems Auda has grown old.
And lost his taste for fighting.
It is well you say it in my tent, thou old tulip.
Yet this is a tulip that the Turks could not buy.
Why should they wish to?
Now...
I will tell you what they pay me, and you will tell me if this is...
...a servant's wages.
They pay me, month by month...
...100 golden guineas.
150, Auda.
- Who told you that?
- I have long ears.
And a long tongue between them.
100, 150, what matters?
It's a trifle.
A trifle which they take from a great box they have.
In Aqaba.
- In Aqaba?
- Where else?
You trouble me like women.
Friends, we've been foolish.
Auda will not come to Aqaba.
- For money?
- No.
- For Feisal?
- No!
Nor to drive away the Turks.
He will come...
...because it is his pleasure.
Thy mother mated with a scorpion.
Make God your agent!
Aqaba!
Aqaba!
God be with you.
God be with you.
God be with you.
God be with you.
Yes.
Aqaba.
Tomorrow we will go and get it.
- Do you think we shall?
- Yes.
If you are right about the guns.
He killed. He dies.
This is the end of Aqaba.
One of our men murdered Auda's man.
Why?
Theft? Blood feud?
It makes no matter why.
Ali!
It is an ancient wound.
I didn't come here to watch a tribal bloodbath.
It is the law, Lawrence.
The law says the man must die.
If he dies, will that content the Howeitat?
Yes.
Sherif Ali!
If none of Lord Auda's men harms any of yours...
...will that content the Harith?
- Yes.
Then I will execute the law.
I have no tribe.
And no one is offended.
Gasim.
Did you do it?
Well, Lawrence...
What ails the Englishman?
That that he killed was the man he brought out of the Nefud.
It was written, then.
Better to have left him.
It was execution, Lawrence.
No shame in that.
Besides, it was necessary.
You gave life and you took it.
The writing is still yours.
Auda Abu Tayi!
The miracle is accomplished.
Garlands for the conqueror.
Tribute for the prince.
Flowers for the man.
I'm none of those things, Ali.
- What, then?
- Don't know.
Thanks.
My God, I love this country.
What!
No gold in Aqaba!
Auda, I found it!
That's a pity.
Ali, get a message down the coast to Yenbo.
Tell Feisal to find boats, any boats...
...and bring the Arab army here to Aqaba, quickly.
And you?
I'm going to tell the generals...
...in Cairo.
Yes, cross Sinai.
Come on!
Sinai?
Yes.
- With these?
- They'll be all right with me.
Look, Ali. If any of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and said:
"We've taken Aqaba," the generals would laugh.
I see.
In Cairo you will put off these funny clothes.
You'll wear trousers and tell stories of our quaintness and barbarity...
...and then they will believe you.
You're an ignorant man.
Paper.
Paper!
There is no gold in Aqaba.
No gold.
No great box!
Did Auda come to Aqaba for gold?
For my pleasure, as you said.
But gold is honorable...
...and Lawrence promised gold.
Lawrence lied.
See, Auda.
"The Crown of England...
...promises to pay...
...5000 golden guineas...
...to Auda Abu Tayi."
Signed in His Majesty's absence...
...by...
...me.
In 10 days...
...I'll be back with the gold.
With gold, with guns, with everything.
Ten days.
You'll cross Sinai?
Why not?
Moses did.
And you will take the children?
Moses did.
Moses was a prophet...
...and beloved of God.
He said there was gold here.
He lied.
He is not perfect.
Lord, can we not rest?
I told you, no rest till they know that I have Aqaba.
Have you two slept in beds?
Farraj?
Daud?
With sheets?
Tomorrow the finest sheets in the finest room and hotel in Cairo.
I promise.
Then it shall be so, lord.
Look!
Pillar of fire.
No, lord. Dust.
My compass.
No matter.
If we ride west, we must strike the canal.
Due west.
Come on!
Lawrence!
Farraj!
Farraj, don't! Don't!
Don't!
Why do you walk?
But why, lord?
But why, lord?
There is room for both.
It serves no purpose.
Lawrence, look!
It's all right, Farraj.
It's all right.
Who are you?
Who are you?
- Daud!
- We're here, sir.
You taking him in there?
Yes.
Here!
Here. You!
And where the hell do you think you're going to, Mustapha?
We are thirsty.
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.
- Are you going to the officers' bar?
- Yes.
You can't take him in there, sir.
What do you think you look like?
No, no. You must go.
No, no. Go, effendi, go!
Get out! You must get out! Get out!
We want two large glasses of lemonade.
- This is a bar for British officers.
- We are not particular.
- Are you off your head?
- No. Oddly enough I'm not.
- Just clear out of here, will you?
- Get that boy out of here.
Corporal, we'll have this one out anyway.
- Get that wog out of here.
- Clear off.
What's going on?
- It's Lawrence, sir.
- Lemonade with ice.
Explain yourself.
We've taken Aqaba.
- Taken Aqaba? Who has?
- We have.
Our side in this war has.
The wogs have.
We have.
He likes your lemonade.
You mean the Turks have gone?
No, they're still there but they've no boots.
Prisoners, sir. We took them prisoners. The entire garrison.
That's not true. We killed some.
Too many, really.
I'll manage it better next time.
There's been a lot of killing one way or another.
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's all perfectly true.
- It isn't possible.
- Yes, it is.
I did it.
You'd better talk to Allenby.
- General Allenby?
- He's in command. Murray's gone.
That's a step in the right direction.
First I want a room.
With a bed, with sheets.
- Yes, of course.
- It's for him.
Right. You want a bed yourself, don't you?
See Allenby first, though.
Will he see me?
I think so.
Do that, then.
- I'd better shave.
- Yes, you had.
You'd better get into some trousers too.
"Undisciplined.
Unpunctual.
Untidy.
Several languages.
Knowledge of music...
...literature.
Knowledge of...
Knowledge of..."
You're an interesting man, there's no doubt about it.
- Who told you to take Aqaba?
- Nobody.
- Sir.
- Sir.
Then why did you?
- Aqaba's important.
- Why is it important?
- It's the Turkish route to the canal.
- Not anymore.
- They're coming through Beersheba.
- I know, but we've gone to Gaza.
- So?
- So that left Aqaba behind your right.
True.
And it will be further behind your right when you go for Jerusalem.
Am I going for Jerusalem?
Yes.
Very well.
Aqaba behind my right.
It threatened EI' Arish and Gaza.
Anything else?
Yes.
Aqaba's linked with Medina.
Do you think we should shift them out of Medina now?
No. I think you should leave them there.
You acted without orders, you know.
Shouldn't officers use their initiative at all times?
Not really. It's awfully dangerous.
Yes, I know.
Already?
Yes.
I'm promoting you major.
I don't think that's a very good idea.
I didn't ask you.
I want you to go back...
...and carry on the good work.
No. Thank you, sir.
- Why not?
- Well, I, it's...
Let me see now...
I killed two people.
I mean, two Arabs.
One was a boy.
That was...
...yesterday.
I led him into a quicksand.
The other was a man.
That was...
...before Aqaba, anyway.
I had to execute him with my pistol.
There was something about it
I didn't like.
- Well, naturally.
- No. Something else.
That's all right.
Let it be a warning.
No. Something else.
What, then?
I enjoyed it.
Rubbish. Rubbish and nerves.
You're tired.
What do you mean coming dressed like that? Amateur theatricals?
Yes. Entirely.
Let me see that hat thing or whatever it is.
Fascinating gear they wear.
How would I look in this, Harry?
- Damn ridiculous, sir.
- Here, you keep it.
What I'm trying to say is I don't think I'm fit for it.
Really? What do you think, Dryden?
Before he did it, sir, I'd have said it couldn't be done.
- Brighton?
- I know what he thinks.
I think you should recommend a decoration, sir.
I don't think it matters what his motives were.
It was a brilliant bit of soldiering.
- Mr. Perkins!
- Sir!
Let's have a drink, gentlemen.
- You've heard about this, Mr. Perkins?
- Yes, sir.
- What do you think about it?
- Bloody marvellous, sir. Well done.
- Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
- Sir!
Come on, then.
You're a clever man, sir.
No, but I know a good thing when I see one.
That's fair, surely?
If I need a breakthrough to Jerusalem,
I must concentrate, not dissipate.
- Bravo.
- You know better?
I fight like Clausewitz, then you fight like Saxe.
We should do very well indeed, shouldn't we?
Easy, gentlemen, please.
- Give us something to drink.
- Of course, sir.
I'm here at the invitation of Major Lawrence.
Tracy.
Shall we go outside?
So you hold bound the Turkish desert army?
Yes.
With 1000 Arabs?
With 1000 Arabs?
1000 Arabs means 1000 knives.
Delivered anywhere, day or night.
It means 1000 camels.
That means 1000 packs of high explosives and 1000 crack rifles.
We can cross Arabia while
Johnny Turk is still turning round.
I'll smash his railways.
While he mends,
I'll smash them somewhere else.
In 13 weeks I can have
Arabia in chaos.
You are going back, then?
Yes.
Of course I'm going back.
Well, if we can see it, so can the Turk.
If he finds he's using four divisions to fend off a handful of bandits...
...he'll withdraw.
He daren't withdraw.
Arabia's part of his empire.
If he gets out now, he'll never get back again.
- I wonder who will.
- No one will.
Arabia's for the Arabs now.
That's what I've told them anyway.
That's what they think.
- That's why they're fighting.
- Oh, surely.
They've only one suspicion.
That we'll let them drive the Turks out and then move in ourselves.
I've told them that that's false, that we have no ambitions in Arabia.
Have we?
I'm not a politician, thank God.
Have we any ambition in Arabia, Dryden?
Difficult question, sir.
I want to know, sir, if I can tell them in your name...
...that we've no ambitions in Arabia.
Certainly.
2000 small arms, not enough.
I need five.
Right.
Money. It'll have to be sovereigns.
They don't like paper.
- Instructors for the Lewis guns.
- Right.
More money.
- How much more?
- 25,000 now. A lot more later.
- Dryden?
- It can be done, sir.
A couple of armoured cars.
Right.
Field artillery.
Right.
I'll give you every blessed thing I can...
...because I know you'll use it.
Congratulations.
Thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen.
Congratulations!
Are you really going to give them artillery, sir?
I was wondering that, sir.
Might be difficult to get it back.
Give them artillery and you've made them independent.
Then I can't give it to them, can I?
- For you to say.
- No, it's not.
I've got orders to obey, thank God.
Not like that poor devil.
He's riding the whirlwind.
Let's hope we're not.
Excuse me, friend.
Who do these bags belong to?
To Prince Feisal.
- You're not Prince Feisal?
- No.
You know him though?
He is my master. I am his servant.
Can you read?
Chicago Courier is my paper, but my work is syndicated in America.
I understood so from your letter,
Mr. Bentley.
Now...
- Where can I find Major Lawrence?
- Is that what you have come for?
Not altogether, sir, no.
Well, Mr. Bentley, you will find
Major Lawrence with my army.
That's what I meant, sir.
Where can I find your army?
I don't know.
- Last week they were near El Ghira.
- Ghira?
Yes, I fear you have a long journey.
Can you ride a camel?
- I've never tried.
- Take a mule.
Avoid Mellaha, the Turks are there.
In Mellaha now? They move fast.
They do.
But not so fast as we do, you will find.
Myself...
...I am going to Cairo.
- As you know.
- Yes.
There's work for me there of a different kind.
Yes.
I understand you've been given no artillery.
- That is so.
- You're handicapped?
It restricts us to small things.
It's intended to.
Do you know General Allenby?
Watch out for Allenby.
He's a slim customer.
- Excuse me?
- A clever man.
Slim customer. It's very good.
I'll certainly watch out for him.
You're being very sympathetic.
Your Highness, we Americans were once a colonial people.
We naturally feel sympathetic to any people...
...who struggle for their freedom.
Very gratifying.
Also, my interests are the same as yours. You want your story told.
I badly want a story to tell.
Ah, now you are talking turkey, are you not?
I will give you a guide and a letter.
And before I leave here...
...which must be presently...
...I will have some facts and figures put on paper for you.
You know that we are destroying the Turkish railways.
I do, sir.
Major Lawrence is in charge of all this, is he?
My army is made up of tribes.
The tribes are led by the tribal leaders.
Your people do think very highly of Major Lawrence?
Oh, yes. And the rightly.
In this country, Mr. Bentley...
...the man who gives victory in battle is prized...
...beyond every other man.
One figure I can give you from my head...
...because it never leaves my head.
Since starting this campaign four months ago, we have lost...
...37 wounded...
...156 dead.
You remark the disproportion between our dead and wounded.
Yeah.
Four times as many.
That's because those too wounded to bring away, we ourselves kill.
We leave no wounded for the Turks.
- You mean?
- We leave no wounded for the Turks.
In their eyes, we are not soldiers but rebels.
Rebels, wounded or whole, are not protected by the Geneva Code...
...and are treated harshly.
How harshly?
More harshly than I hope you can imagine.
I see.
Our own prisoners are taken care of until the British...
...can relieve us of them, according to the Code.
- I should like you to notice that.
- Yes, sir.
Is that the influence of Major Lawrence?
Why should you suppose?
It's just that I heard in Cairo that...
...Major Lawrence has a horror of bloodshed.
That is exactly so.
With Major Lawrence, mercy is a passion.
With me, it is merely good manners.
You may judge which motive is the more reliable.
- And now, perhaps...
- Oh, sure, sure.
Thank you, sir.
Can you manage the letter...?
I'll do everything I have said...
...if you will tell me truly the nature of your interest...
...in my people and Major Lawrence.
It's very simple, sir.
I'm looking for a hero.
Indeed.
You do not seem a romantic man.
Oh, no.
But influential men back home believe it's time for America...
...to lend her weight to the struggle against Germany.
And Turkey.
I've been sent to find material to show our people that this war is...
- Enjoyable?
- Hardly that, sir.
But to show it in its more adventurous aspects.
You look for a figure who will draw your country towards war.
All right. Yes.
Lawrence is your man.
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Come on, men!
Lawrence!
Good God! God!
Jiminy! Never seen a man killed with a sword before.
Why don't you take a picture?
Wish I had.
How is it with thee, Lawrence?
Am I in this?
Did you take his picture?
Yeah.
You are using up your nine lives very quickly.
Charming company you keep.
Auda?
He's a bit old-fashioned. He thinks these things will steal his virtue.
He thinks you're a kind of thief.
It's all right to take your picture?
- All right.
- Okay.
Just walk.
Major Lawrence!
Yes, sir, that's my baby.
This looting has got to stop!
It is customary.
It's theft. And theft makes thieves.
I would not say that to Auda.
- It is their payment, colonel.
- Payment.
Truly. Are not British soldiers paid?
- They don't go home when being paid.
- They are not free to.
Well, there's another lot you've seen the last of.
They'll come back.
He says they'll come back.
Will they?
Not this year, Lawrence.
Look, Lawrence, how many men do you think you'll have left? 200?
- Less.
- Well, then?
I said, they'll come back.
You badly hurt?
Not hurt at all.
Didn't you know? They can only kill me with a golden bullet.
It is for children.
I have set myself to learn again.
- What are you learning from this?
- Politics.
You'll be a democracy in this country?
You gonna have a parliament?
I will tell you that when I have a country.
Did I answer well?
You answered without saying anything. That's politics.
You learn quickly.
I have a good teacher.
Yeah.
- How's your hurt?
- Fine.
Before I return to the fleshpots, which I shall be very glad to do...
...may I put two questions to you, straight?
I'd be interested to hear you put a question straight.
One.
What, in your opinion, do these people hope to gain from this war?
They hope to gain their freedom.
Freedom.
"They hope to gain their freedom."
- There's one born every minute.
- They're going to get it.
I'm going to give it to them.
- The second question?
- Well, I was going to ask...
...what is it that attracts you personally to the desert?
It's clean.
Well, now...
...that's a very illuminating answer.
May I...
...take one farewell picture?
I gave Math Budad two lamps for it.
One clock for two lamps.
A fair bargain.
Fair? I robbed him.
Trash.
I must find something honorable.
Honorable?
The year is running out, Brighton.
I must find something honorable.
Now you may blow up my train.
And what will you do now?
Now I go home.
They will carry my toys.
They will carry my toys too, see?
Major Lawrence will campaign this winter.
But you got what you wanted, so you're going home, is that it?
Of course. When Lawrence has got what he wants, he will go home.
When you've got what you want, you will go home.
No, I shan't, Auda.
Then you are a fool.
Maybe. But I am not a deserter.
Give thanks to God, Brighton...
...that when He made you a fool,
He gave you a fool's face.
You are an impudent rascal.
I must go, Lawrence, before I soil myself with a fool's blood.
Like talking to a brick wall.
So what will you do now?
What can you do?
I'll go north.
That's what Allenby wants.
Allenby wanted the Arab army behind Deraa.
Then that's where I'll take it.
Tell Allenby to hurry up, or we'll be in Deraa before he's in Jerusalem.
Won't we?
Train, Farraj.
Yeah, Lawrence.
Hide yourself, my friend.
Detonator.
All right, fetch another.
- Pardon, Lawrence. I put...
- Plenty of time. Fetch another.
Farraj?
- What happened?
- Detonator. A detonator!
He cannot ride, Lawrence. Look.
If they take him alive, you know what they'll do to him.
Daud will be angry with you.
Salute him for me.
What will you do now?
Go north.
With twenty?
What would you recommend me to do?
What would you recommend?
He hasn't 1 l10 so many men, sir.
He's lied, in fact.
Yes and no. He doesn't claim to have done anything he hasn't done.
Then there is an Arab north army.
- No, sir, he has lied about that.
- Any idea why?
- It's his army, I suppose.
- It's Prince Feisal's army.
Do you think he's gone native, Harry?
No.
He would if he could, I think.
- Not my line of country.
- It doesn't matter. Just curious.
What matters is I believed it.
The Turks believe it.
They are offering 20,000 pounds for him.
Good heavens.
- Shouldn't say he had long to live.
- Whatever else, he's a brave man...
Surely, surely. If he's still going north with 50 men, he doesn't lack guts.
I wonder if they'd offer that much for me.
What about next year?
Will they still come back?
I wouldn't be surprised.
- They think he's a kind of prophet.
- They do or he does?
- Now may I speak?
- Yes.
One more failure and you will find yourself alone.
- I do not include myself.
- I do not include the others.
So say they love you.
The more reason to be thrifty with them.
Give them something to do that can be done. But you, no.
They must move mountains, walk on water.
That's right. That's right.
Who are you to know what can be done?
If we'd done what you thought could be done, we'd be in Yenbo now.
Whatever I ask them to do can be done. They know that if you don't.
Do you think I'm just anybody?
Do you?
My friends, who will walk on water with me?
- Who will come with me into Deraa?
- Deraa is garrisoned.
Will you take 20 against 2000?
- I'll go by myself if I have to.
- Why?
Because I told the English generals...
...the Arab revolt would be in Deraa when they'd be in Jerusalem.
Or perhaps you are here...
...for the English generals.
Who says this?
Rumour.
That is not an argument.
Oh, argument.
This afternoon I will take the Arab revolt into Deraa...
...while the Arabs argue.
Can you pass for an Arab in an Arab town?
Yes. If one of you would lend me some dirty clothes.
It's madness.
What are you looking for?
Some way to announce myself.
Be patient with him, God.
- Do you not see how they look at you?
- Peace, Ali, I am invisible.
Halt!
Walk on.
- Halt!
- Walk on.
You and you.
You.
You have blue eyes.
- I say you have blue eyes.
- Yes, effendi.
- Are you Circassian?
- Yes, effendi.
How old are you?
Twenty-seven, effendi.
I think.
You look older.
You have had a lot of experience.
It's an interesting face.
I am surrounded by cattle.
He wouldn't know an interesting face from a sow's belly.
I have been is Deraa now for three and a half years.
If they posted me to the dark side of the moon, I could not be more...
...isolated.
You haven't the least idea what I'm talking about.
No, effendi.
Have you?
No.
That would be too...
...lucky.
Where did you get that?
- It's old, effendi.
- No, this is recent.
- You are a deserter.
- No, effendi.
Yes, you are a deserter.
But from which army?
Not that it matters at all.
A man cannot be always in uniform.
Your skin is very fair.
Beat him.
To me!
Sleep.
Sleep.
Eat.
Eat.
You have a body, like other men.
Good.
Then sleep.
Better?
Much better. You were right.
Rest, rest. Can you not learn?
Oh, I've learned all right.
I'm going, Ali.
- Why?
- Why?
Heavens.
Why?
I've come to the end of myself,
I suppose.
And the end of the Arab revolt?
I'm not the Arab revolt, Ali.
I'm not even Arab.
A man can be whatever he wants.
You said.
I'm sorry. I thought it was true.
You proved it.
Look, Ali. Look.
That's me. What colour is it?
That's me.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
A man can do whatever he wants.
You said.
He can...
...but he can't want what he wants.
This is the stuff that decides what he wants.
You may as well know.
I would've told them anything.
I would've told them who I am.
I would've told them where you were.
- I tried to.
- So would any man.
Well, any man is what I am.
And I'm going back to Allenby to ask him for a job...
...that any man can do.
Allenby's in Jerusalem.
- I'll make easy stages.
- You?
Oh, yes. Easy stages.
Look, Ali, I think I see a way of being just...
...ordinarily...
...happy.
Can I take this?
It is not clean.
No, but it's warm.
And these...
...having led them here, have you no care for them?
You lead them. They're yours.
Trust your own people.
And let me go back to mine.
- I say, don't forget those form fives.
- All right.
Mind if I join you?
Honoured, sir.
- Good to be back.
- We heard you were, sir.
- What's doing out there?
- Where?
- Arabia?
- Well, yes, sir.
Nothing much. Wrong time of year.
What's doing here?
We're settling in.
We built a squash court.
Jolly good.
Well, I have to go up there.
It's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.
Bloody wogs.
Yes, probably.
Jolly good about the squash court.
Lays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?
Morning.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good to be back.
- I'll believe you, sir.
- No, really it is.
Hello.
Morning. You're to go right in.
Lawrence.
Or is it Major Lawrence?
Sir.
Well, general, I will leave you.
Major Lawrence doubtless has reports to make...
...about my people and their weakness...
...and the need to keep them in the British interest.
And the French interest too.
We must not forget the French.
I told you, sir, no such treaty exists.
Yes, general, you have lied most bravely, but not convincingly.
I know this treaty does exist.
Treaty, sir?
He does it better than you, general.
But then, of course, he is almost an Arab.
You really don't know?
Then what the devil's this?
It's my request for release from Arabia, sir.
For what reason?
You sure you haven't heard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?
No.
- I can guess.
- Don't guess. Tell him.
Well, now...
Mr. Sykes is an English civil servant.
Monsieur Picot is a French civil servant.
Mr. Sykes and Monsieur Picot met, and they agreed that after the war...
...France and England should share the Turkish Empire.
Including Arabia.
They signed an agreement, not a treaty, sir.
An agreement to that effect.
There may be honour among thieves, but there's none in politicians.
And let's have no displays of indignation.
You may not have known, but you certainly had suspicions.
If we've told lies, you've told half-lies.
And a man who tells lies, like me, merely hides the truth.
But a man who tells half-lies has forgotten where he put it.
The truth is I'm an ordinary man.
You might have told me that, Dryden.
And I want an ordinary job, sir.
That's my reason for resigning.
It's personal.
- Personal?
- Yes, sir.
Personal?
You're a serving officer in the field.
And as it happens, a damned important one. Are you mad?
No, and if you don't mind,
I'd rather not go mad.
That's my reason too.
Look, I'm making my big push on Damascus the 16th of next month...
...and you are part of it.
Can you understand that? You're an important part of the big push!
I don't want to be part of your big push!
What about your Arab friends?
I have no Arab friends!
I don't want Arab friends!
What in hell do you want, Lawrence?
I've told you, I just want my ration of common humanity.
- Lawrence.
- Yes?
Nothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.
That's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Dryden.
Thank you, sir.
Why don't we?
There's blood on your back.
- Do you want a doctor?
- No.
Tell me what happened.
Say, what goes on in there?
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on!
- No, really. Nothing at all.
- Is the man in trouble?
I expect so. We all have troubles.
Life's a vale of troubles.
Let me know if the man's in trouble.
I've got a claim in that man.
- What claim?
- I've made that boy a hero.
When the war's over, he can be anything he wants.
Yes. Well, at the moment he wants to be somebody else.
Will you kindly allow me to pass?
Walk away, Dryden, walk away.
Always walking away, aren't you?
Well, I'll tell you.
It's a clash of temperament that's going on in there.
Inevitably, one of them's half-mad...
...and the other, wholly unscrupulous.
I believe your name will be a household word...
...when you'd have to go to the war museum to find who Allenby was.
You're the most extraordinary man
I ever met.
Leave me alone.
- Leave me alone.
- That's a feeble thing to say.
- I know I'm not ordinary.
- That's not what I'm saying.
All right, I'm extraordinary.
What of it?
Not many people have a destiny, Lawrence.
It's a terrible thing for a man to flunk it if he has.
Are you speaking from experience?
No.
You're guessing, then.
Suppose you're wrong.
Why suppose that?
We both know I'm right.
- Yes. I said, yes.
- After all...
- The 16th?
- Can you do it?
I'll give you a lot of money.
- Artillery?
- I can't.
They won't be coming for money, not the best of them.
They'll be coming for Damascus.
Which I'm going to give them.
That's all I want.
All you want is someone holding down the Turkish Right.
But I'm going to give them Damascus.
We'll get there before you do.
And when we've got it, we'll keep it.
Tell the politicians to burn their paper now.
Fair enough.
Fair? What's fair got to do with it?
It's going to happen.
I shall want quite a lot of money.
All there is.
Not that much.
The best of them won't come for money.
They'll come for me.
No pictures!
It's not for you, it's for Major Lawrence.
He doesn't mind having his picture taken. He doesn't mind at all.
Well, there's only one Lawrence.
Have you met Major Lawrence since he's come back?
Yes.
- Changed, hasn't he?
- No.
Oh, I'd say he had.
Different man, I'd say.
What did that Turkish general do to him in Deraa?
He was the same man after Deraa.
The same man, humbled.
What did the English general do to him in Jerusalem?
Search me. Ask Lawrence.
- I did.
- What did he say?
He laughed.
He told me to gather the Harith here.
He offered me money.
Did you take it?
No. But many did.
- What is this?
- This is my bodyguard.
There is not a man without a price on his head.
- There's a price on my head too.
- But these are murderers.
The sheiks will hang these men.
These men are mine.
Lawrence, these things know nothing of the Arab revolt.
- You, Ghitan of Aleppo.
- Sherif?
- Where do we ride?
- Damascus, sherif.
Aye, but for what?
Sherif, for Lawrence.
- You have bought these things.
- I bought half the men here, Ali.
That is different.
These are not ordinary men.
I don't want ordinary men. Hut!
Damascus!
Damascus! Damascus!
Damascus! Damascus!
Very well, gentlemen. The cavalry's gone through Mazril and Deraa.
Very good, by the way.
Very good indeed. Now your turn.
If the enemy's retreating in any order, which we'll assume...
Certainly.
He can't be far from Mallud...
...in which case I can have him within range by 0900 hours tomorrow.
Splendid. Philip.
These are the last infantry supports going up now.
But Mallud, we could have the fusiliers there by Wednesday.
That'll do for now.
The guns are what matter.
Any questions?
This Arab army on the right, sir, what's it consist of?
Irregular cavalry, sir. About 2000.
Where are they now?
- Can only know by being with them.
- Then get with them. I want to know.
Pound them, Charley.
Pound them.
God help the men who lie under that.
They're Turks.
God help them.
Well, he's got the bit between his teeth all right.
Cocky?
More than cocky, sir.
He's got the bit between his teeth all right.
I tell you, sir, I think he'll get to Damascus before we do.
- Unless...
- Unless?
Well, there's a Turkish column in front of him, out of Mazril.
- What do the Turks have in Mazril?
- A brigade, sir.
I wonder where they are now.
No prisoners.
Damascus, Lawrence.
Lawrence, not this.
Go round.
Damascus, Lawrence, Damascus.
No prisoners.
This was Talaal's village.
Talaal!
Talaal!
No prisoners!
No prisoners!
God.
God.
God!
Enough.
Enough! Make them stop!
Major!
Major Lawrence!
Jesus wept.
Jesus wept.
Does it surprise you, Mr. Bentley?
Surely you know the Arabs are a barbarous people.
Barbarous and cruel.
Who but they?
Who but they?
Oh, you rotten man.
Here, let me take your rotten bloody picture.
For the rotten bloody newspapers.
These were cut last night,
Lawrence, in Damascus.
Damascus!
Take them to Sherif Ali.
Tell him.
Remind him.
- Is Allenby in Damascus?
- Near.
Tell Sherif Ali that.
They are not ripe.
General salute!
Present arms!
Port arms!
Lawrence is behind it, sir.
The whole town is plastered with the Arab flag.
- When?
- A day and a night, sir.
They've been here a day and a night.
They've occupied the town.
They've done it.
He's set up his own headquarters in the town hall.
What else beside the town hall?
Telephone exchange, post office, powerhouse...
...hospitals, fire station.
Everything, sir.
They call themselves the Arab National Council...
...and they're in the town hall.
Well, they're your pigeon, Harry.
What should we do about it?
Get them out of it, sir, quick time.
How about that, Dryden?
Not unless you want a full-scale rising.
- What, then?
- When will Feisal be in Damascus?
By special train in two days' time.
Two days.
Two days is what you asked for.
I can't keep him out any longer.
- Isn't it enough?
- Yes.
- Ample, I should think.
- We can't just do nothing.
Why not? It's usually best.
Get us something to drink, Tracey.
And Tracey, all troops to remain quartered until further orders.
Does that apply to technical units?
Technical units particularly.
Yes, sir.
Medicals too, sir?
I'm afraid so, Harry.
Medicals too.
We here...
...are neither Harith nor Howeitat...
...nor any other tribe, but Arabs...
...of the Arab Council, acting for Prince Feisal.
He insulted me.
Sherif Ali said that the telephones are in the care of the Howeitat...
...and they have ceased to work.
And this is true.
They will not work because they are given no electricity.
The electricity is in the care of the Harith.
If you answer, there will be bloodshed.
You speak to me of bloodshed?
I ask pardon of Auda Abu Tayi.
Humbly?
Humbly, Harith?
Yes, humbly.
This is a new trick.
Why is there no electricity?
I have been to that electrical house, Lawrence.
There are three large machines.
He means generators!
So.
One of them is burning.
They are of an incredible size, but helpless.
It is so of all machines.
Let them burn.
What need of telephones?
- The need is absolute.
- Then we need English engineers.
No. Take English engineers and you take English government.
Take...
Fire has broken out.
- Where?
- The Jinsibi district.
- It is not a district that matters.
- It will spread!
Then use the fire brigade!
We have tried, but there is no force in the water.
Then you must carry it.
- The Ruala do not carry water.
- What else are they good for?
We will hear petitions this afternoon.
This afternoon!
- I'll take this up after the war.
- Surely we should do something, sir.
- It's an old man's sport.
- Are you an old man, sir?
All I can say is, sir, it's a heavy responsibility.
Sorry, sir.
Maybe it's the bulb.
No, sir.
It's the power.
They're leaving.
That's it, then.
Marvellous-Iooking beggars, aren't they?
Leave it, Lawrence. Come with me.
- Come where?
- Back.
I know your heart.
What is it?
Is it this?
I tell you, this is nothing.
Is it the blood?
The desert has dried up more blood than you could think of.
I pray that I may never see the desert again.
Hear me, God.
You will come.
There is only the desert for you.
What about you?
No, I shall stay here and learn politics.
A very low occupation.
I had not thought of it when I met you.
You have tried very hard to give us Damascus.
It's what I came for.
And then...
...it would be something.
Yes.
Much.
- He is your friend?
- Take your hand away.
- You love him.
- I fear him.
Then why do you weep?
If I fear him, who love him...
...how must he fear himself, who hates himself?
Take your hand away, Howeitat!
So you are not yet entirely politician.
Not yet.
Well, these are new tricks, and I am an old dog.
And Allah be thanked.
I'll tell thee what...
...being an Arab will be thornier than you suppose, Harith.
In all my years,
I've never seen anything like it.
It comes within the jurisdiction of the Arab Council.
Under the circumstances, I think
I must take over. Immediately.
Under any circumstances at all, you must obey your orders.
No, sir, I will not.
Control yourself.
Now, go over to the town hall and see what they say.
We did what we could in the civic hospitals.
But you forgot the Turkish Military Hospital.
It has 600 beds. There are about 2000 Turkish wounded in it.
All of whom are the responsibility of your precious Arab Council.
What's it like?
This is outrageous!
Outrageous!
Outrageous!
You filthy little wog!
My friend Lawrence, if I may call him that.
"My friend Lawrence."
How many men will claim the right to use that phrase? How proudly.
He longs for the greenness of his native land.
He pines for the Gothic cottages of Surrey, is it not?
Already in imagination, he catches trout...
...and all the activities of the English gentleman.
That's me you're describing, sir, not Colonel Lawrence.
You're promoted colonel.
Yes. What for?
Take the honour, colonel.
Be a little kind.
As a colonel, you'll have a cabin to yourself on the boat home.
Then, thank you.
Well, then...
...Godspeed.
There's nothing further here for a warrior.
We drive bargains. Old men's work.
Young men make wars, and the virtues of war...
...are the virtues of young men.
Courage and hope for the future.
Then old men make the peace.
And the vices of peace are the vices of old men.
Mistrust and caution.
It must be so.
What I owe you is beyond evaluation.
The powerhouse, the telephone exchange, these I concede.
The pumping plant I must retain.
If you retain it, there will be no water.
- I shall be glad of assistance.
- Then you must bring down your flag.
I shall not, and if your men attempt it, my men will resist it.
- Have you men?
- Enough of that.
It's a thing that makes an ugly incident.
I'm sure your government...
...does not wish to appear at the peace conference as an aggressor.
I say!
It's Lawrence, isn't it?
May I shake your hand, sir?
Just want to be able to say I'd done it, sir.
Haven't we met before?
Don't think so, sir.
No, no, sir, I should remember that.
It is widely known the Arab Council took power in my name.
They have no power. It's illusory.
Illusions can be very powerful.
Particularly...
...when they take this form.
The world is delighted at the picture of Damascus...
...liberated by the Arab army.
Led, may I remind you, by a British-serving officer.
Ah, yes. But then Lawrence is a sword with two edges.
We are equally glad to be rid of him, are we not?
I thought I was a hard man, sir.
You are merely a general.
I must be a king.
Excuse me, sir.
Well?
Well...
...it seems we're to have a British waterworks...
...with an Arab flag on it.
Do you think it was worth it?
Not my business.
Thank God I'm a soldier.
Yes, sir.
So you keep saying.
You, I suspect...
...are chief architect of this compromise.
- What do you think?
- Me, Your Highness?
On the whole, I wish
I'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.
Well, sir. Going home.
Home, sir.
Goodbye, Dolly, I must leave you
Though it breaks my heart to go
Aussteigen.
Tor aufmachen!
Go inside.
Hurry up.
This way.
Hurry up.
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?
- I...
- No, that's mine.
Allez... hup!
How far are the trees, Danny?
- Over 200 feet.
- Yeah, I'd say 300.
Long ways to dig.
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.
Willie, you think X got away?
He'd have sent us word, somehow, if he had.
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.
Good morning, Group Captain.
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer, you are to be liaison between the prisoners and the colonel.
He wishes to make clear to you certain matters of...
- The word is "policy"?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Herein.
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.
I am Colonel Von Luger.
Please sit down.
Group Captain Ramsey, in the past four years the Reich has been forced to spend an enormous amount of time, energy, manpower and equipment hunting down escaping prisoner-of-war officers.
At least it's rather nice to know you're wanted, isn't it?
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty of all officers to try to escape.
If they can't, it is their duty to cause the enemy to use an inordinate number of troops to guard them, and their sworn duty to harass the enemy to the best of their ability.
Yes, I know.
The men under your authority have been most successful.
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.
Caught in the North Sea, escaped, recaptured, escaped, recaptured.
Archibald "Archie" Ives, eleven escape attempts.
Even tried to jump out of the truck coming here.
Dickes, William.
Known to have participated in digging of
11 escape tunnels.
Flight Lieutenant Willinski, four escapes.
MacDonald, nine.
Hendley, the American, five.
Haynes, four. Sedgwick, seven.
The list is almost endless.
One man here has made 17 attempted escapes.
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.
- Quite.
- And it must stop!
Colonel, do you expect officers to forget their duty?
No.
It is because we expect the opposite that we have brought you here.
This is a new camp.
It has been built to hold you and your men.
It is organized to incorporate all we have learned of security measures.
And, in me, you will not be dealing with a common jailer, but with a staff officer personally selected for the task by the Luftwaffe high command.
We have, in effect, put all our rotten eggs in one basket, and we intend to watch this basket carefully.
Very wise.
You will not be denied the usual facilities.
Sports, a library, a recreation hall...
And, for gardening, we will give you tools.
We trust you to use them for gardening.
Devote your energies to these things.
Give up your hopeless attempts to escape.
And, with intelligent cooperation, we may all sit out the war... as comfortably as possible.
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.
Of course. Why do you come to Germany?
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?
- In 1812 they burned your Capitol.
- That's propaganda.
It's in the history books. I read it.
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.
Yeah. No tools.
Hey, Virgil.
Hey, did you see the cooler?
Boy, is it ever a big one!
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.
Those two guys who were with us in the old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- I guess.
What were their names?
It was Jackson and, uh...
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Danny. Who are they?
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.
Willie, cigarettes.
Danny and I have a blitz in mind.
Could you put on a brief show for the goons?
Sure, man. What'll it be?
An all-out go?
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles?
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!
- Are you pushing me?
- That's mine, you son of a...
Tovarich.
Spasibo.
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!
It's all right, mate.
We're just having a friendly little argument.
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.
You, too!
Get away! Get back in your huts!
Go on!
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only one other American in the whole camp.
Some guy named Hendley in the RAF Eagle squadron.
Hey, you got something goin' already?
See the way the goons got those towers placed?
There's a blind spot through the middle.
A blind spot?
A guy could stand at that wire and not be seen by either tower.
They'd never see me, especially at night.
You're crazy.
You think so?
Let's find out right now.
Now, the next step's a little tricky.
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.
I think I'll take a little walk.
Abteilung marsch!
Tovarich.
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.
- Let me have it, mate.
- Ja vas lublu.
- Ja vas...
- Lublu.
Lublu? Ja vas lublu.
Ja vas lublu.
- What's it mean?
- I love you.
I love you? What bloody good is that?
I don't know. I wasn't going to use it myself.
Halt!
Out.
- Out!
- Nyet, nyet. Tovarich.
Your friend, yes?
Tovarich.
And who vouches for you, Lieutenant Willinski?
Get out, Sedgwick.
Spasibo.
Marsch!
Hold it, hold it!
- Your name?
- Ives.
Ives. Ives.
Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.
The photograph doesn't do you justice.
I'd like to see one of you under similar circumstances.
I will not take action against you now.
This is the first day here, and there has been much stupidity and carelessness... on both sides.
Hey! Get out!
Nicht schieben! Nicht schieben!
Don't shoot!
You fool! To cross the wire is death!
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.
Gettin' my baseball.
Stop this!
Get over the wire immediately!
- OK.
- You stay there!
Out of the way. Out.
What are you doing over here by the wire?
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...
Achtung!
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...
I was trying to cut my way through your wire, because I wanna get out.
Durchsuchen Sie ihn.
- Do you speak German?
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
- Wire cutters.
- Jawohl, Herr Oberst.
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite a number of British officers in this war.
And I flatter myself that we understand one another.
You are the first American officer I have met.
Hilts, isn't it?
Captain Hilts, actually.
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.
I suppose what's called in the American army a "hotshot pilot."
Unfortunately, you were shot down anyway.
So we are both grounded for the duration of the war.
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.
I plan on doing so before the war's over.
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?
- About 99 percent.
- Perhaps while you are with us, you will have a chance to learn some.
Ten days isolation, Hilts.
- Captain Hilts.
- Twenty days.
Right.
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?
Cooler.
- Name?
- Ives.
- Flying Officer Ives.
- Cooler, 20 days.
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.
- Hilts.
- Yeah?
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?
No, I was in college.
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.
- How tall are you, Ives?
- Five feet four. Why?
Oh, just wondering.
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.
- Bicycles?
- Motorcycles.
Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.
- Helped pay my tuition.
- I did a wee bit of racing myself.
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?
No, horse racing. Jockey.
Jockey.
Jockey.
Hilts?
Are you there, Hilts?
Yeah, I'm here.
Don't you have them in the States? Jockeys?
- Sure.
- They were the days.
Saturday nights in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.
You had to fight off the birds.
You know, birds.
Girls, man. Girls.
Do you not have them in the States?
Hilts? Are you there, Hilts?
Ives.
What?
You know the kind of clay and gravel we got here in the compound?
How many feet do you think you could get through in eight hours?
I could go through this dirt here like the bit on an end of an auger.
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood, and getting the dirt out, that's what you've to worry about.
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.
How are you going to get the dirt out?
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.
Aye.
Well, what do you think?
I must say, it's an interesting first 20 minutes.
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.
As the sergeant out there says, this is only the first day.
Eric.
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.
He has arrived.
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.
I suggest this prisoner be kept under the strictest security confinement permanently.
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.
We have reason to believe he is the leader of numerous criminal escape attempts.
Squadron Leader Bartlett has been three months in your care, and the Gestapo has only "reason to believe"?
If he once more falls into our hands, he will not be so lucky.
Air-force officer prisoners are the responsibility of the Luftwaffe, not the SS... or the Gestapo.
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.
That is why he is returned, for the moment, to your care.
Of course, if the Luftwaffe is not up to the task, the prisoners will find themselves totally in our charge.
We regretfully are not so professionally understanding.
Squadron Leader Bartlett, if you escape again and be caught, you will be shot.
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Heil Hitler.
Herr Kuhn.
Nehmen Sie dem Mann diese Dinger ab.
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?
Well, it's new.
- Here. Let's find you a bed.
- Thanks.
Come in.
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.
The fellows wanted to put up a welcome committee, but that's for later.
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.
New camp, expert guards, the elite.
You met the commandant?
Yes, I did.
What were the Gestapo and the SS doing with you?
They wanted to find out who helped me to the border.
Who else is here? Cavendish?
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.
- Blythe?
- Yes.
Almost the whole X organization.
Almost. They cleaned out all the other camps and dumped us in this one.
As Von Luger put it,
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."
There's madness in their method.
- What about Tommy Bristol?
- No, but there's an American, Hendley.
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.
Last of the tea until the Red Cross gets through again.
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?
Not nearly as rough as I now intend to give them.
Roger, personal revenge must be kept out of what we have to do here.
Too many lives are at stake.
What my personal feelings are is of no importance.
You appointed me Big X, and it's my duty to harass, confound and confuse the enemy to the best of my ability.
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink in this Third Reich of theirs that thousands of troops'll be tied up here looking after us.
How?
By putting more men out of this... perfect camp of theirs than have ever escaped before.
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.
The goons have put every escape artist in Germany here. You said so yourself.
Have you thought of what it might cost?
I've thought of the humiliation if we just tamely submit, knuckle under and crawl.
Surely you don't advocate that, do you, sir?
I have to point out one thing to you, Roger.
No matter how unsatisfactory this camp may be, the high command have left us in the hands of the Luftwaffe, not the Gestapo and the SS.
Look, sir, you talk about the high command of the Luftwaffe, then the SS and the Gestapo.
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.
There's only one way to put it, sir.
They are the common enemies of everyone who believes in freedom.
If they didn't approve of Hitler, why didn't they throw him out?
I have no argument with you, Roger.
As senior officer,
I'm merely pointing out a pertinent fact.
When are you calling a meeting, X?
Tonight.
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the immortal words of our new commandant.
"Devote your energies to things other than escape, and sit out the war as comfortably as possible."
Well, that's exactly what we're going to do.
We're going to devote our energies to sports and gardening, all the cultural pursuits as far as they're concerned.
In fact, we're going to put the goons to sleep.
Meanwhile... we dig.
Now, even a superficial look at the compound shows us that huts 104 and five are closest to the woods.
The first tunnel goes out from 105, directly east under the cooler and the wire.
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.
- I make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down 30 feet before we go horizontal.
That'll rule out any question of sound detection or probing.
All right, Roger, but... did you say the first tunnel?
I did. There'll be three.
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.
If the goons find one, we'll move into the other.
How many men do you plan to take out, Roger?
Two hundred and fifty.
There'll be no half measures this time.
Identification papers for everyone.
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Mostly civilian clothes.
Yes, but, uh...
OK, Roger.
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations, compasses for all the walkers.
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.
- We're going to tunnel.
- Splendid.
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, in charge of traps.
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions.
Mac, of course, will take care of intelligence.
Hendley. We haven't met.
- Scrounger?
- Right.
Dennis, maps and surveys.
Colin, you'll take your usual job.
Eric, how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated three tunnels, but we'll manage.
Roger, who's going to handle security for all this?
You are. I want a system of stooges covering this compound from front to back, checking every goon in and out.
I want a signal system so perfect that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet of any of the huts in which we're working, we can shut down without a sign.
Well, I don't think there's much point in discussing any more now.
I'll meet each of you on the exercise circuit, we'll pound out the details.
- Nothing else, is there, Mac?
- I shouldn't think so, Roger.
Oh, hello. My name's Blythe.
Hendley.
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.
Oh, not hunting. Watching.
Oh, a... bird watcher?
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.
I suppose you have bird watchers in the States?
Yes, we have some.
Tea?
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.
- Where's your kit?
- This is it.
The rest was confiscated in the last shakedown.
The goons didn't appreciate some of my more... personal items.
Such as.
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.
I'll need a camera.
- What kind?
- A good one.
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter should do all right.
All right.
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.
- Only one?
- Two would be better.
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.
I must have used these wretched leaves about 20 times.
It's not that I mind so much.
Tea without milk is so uncivilized.
Yeah. I'll get our wood.
Close up! Close up!
Close up!
Close up!
Close up!
- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up!
Splendid.
Blythe, what are you doing here?
I'm in Photographic Aerial Reconnaissance Interpretation.
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?
I'm the forger.
Forgers are installing themselves in the recreation hut.
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 110.
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.
- 109? Right.
- I'll work in 107.
For now, Danny, Willie and their trap team will be in 104.
I want to take a chance on the tunnels and press ahead without any shoring-up.
We will need timber for the shafts and the entrance chambers.
Hendley figures there are 36 empty bunks.
We can tear up 15 and move the men around so the goons won't miss them.
The rest will come from strips off the wall.
Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
Not yet.
He's working on some steel for a pick that Danny needs.
Hey! What the hell is going on here?
Turn the water off!
Get your hands away!
Get away!
Hey! What the hell's going on there?
Stop this nonsense!
Get away! Turn the water off!
Somewhere!
In the stove, we keep fire burning, always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 113's washroom.
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.
Not when you're organized, Mac.
- We're ready.
- Big enough?
It's perfect. Right through the middle of the foundation.
Good luck to us, Danny.
Why 17?
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.
All right?
It's good.
It's very good.
- Raus!
- Get out!
- Get out!
- Raus hier!
Raus! Fertig machen da hinten.
Du da hinten. Raus hier!
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?
Mopping up.
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.
Raus!
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.
Raus.
No. I vote no. Look, we've put the goons to sleep exactly like you said.
But just one little thing like this and we're up the creek without a paddle.
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.
I understand you two are contemplating a blitz-out.
Where'd you hear that... sir?
MacDonald. It's Mac's job to know everything that goes on.
We thought, perhaps, we might talk it over.
Why? It's only a two-man job.
Everybody in the camp is supposed to clear all escape attempts in advance with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.
We don't necessarily want to interfere.
It's just that...
Well, what sort of blitz were you contemplating?
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire, a blind spot.
Then we dig down, take the dirt, spread it on top so it won't make a pile, and then straight out.
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs in front, pushes the dirt behind him.
I stash it behind me, then we burrow through the dirt like a couple of moles.
By dawn we're under the wire, across the open space, into the woods and gone.
Well, uh...
When do you intend to try this?
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.
Hilts, this may not be quite the right time for this sort of thing.
Look, sir, I've been in the bag nearly three years now, bloody close to being wire-happy.
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.
It'll work. I know it will.
Good luck.
Thank you.
- Hilts... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.
We shove it up and make air holes as we go along.
Good night, sir.
Now, why didn't anybody think of that before?
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.
But it'll bring every goon in the camp down on top of us.
I don't know. Perhaps we're being too clever.
If we stop all the breakouts, it may only convince the goons that we must be tunneling.
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going to be in the cooler for an awful long time.
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.
This is the dirt from the compound.
This is from the tunnel.
Wherever we put it, they're going to spot it a mile away.
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.
It's the first place the ferrets'd look.
I saw one measuring yesterday.
Maybe we could dry it to the same color.
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.
If you must think, for God's sake, think clearly.
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?
We can't destroy the dirt and we can't eat it.
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.
That's as far as my thinking takes me.
Didn't they teach you promptness in the RN?
You'll never believe it, but I think I have the solution.
The problem is somehow to get rid of this tunnel dirt over the compound.
Well, of course.
Would you mind?
Now... you fill these bags with the dirt from the tunnel.
Then, wearing them inside your trousers, you wander out into the compound where you pull these strings in your pockets.
Out come the pins.
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.
Unless you're a fool, the ferrets won't see a thing.
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. it works.
Mac, this is what we'll do.
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.
Nice garden you've got, sir.
All right. Let's look sharp.
That looks sharp.
Sir.
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.
I am sorry the soil here isn't better suited to your men's purpose.
We'll manage, sir.
I must say I am surprised with the extent of this activity, Group Captain.
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.
- The English are keen on gardening.
- Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.
Good point.
I have the nasty feeling he knows exactly what we're doing.
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.
Here we are. Now, let's see.
Biscuits, two packets.
Coffee, two tins.
Bovril, one jar.
Cigarettes, six packets.
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Blackcurrant jam, Cavendish.
And marmalade, mine.
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.
That cleans out the gift food for the entire organization.
Now, the first thing we need is the new form of travel permit.
The forgers have no idea what it looks like.
I'll see what I can do.
And, of course, any other identity cards, personal papers, documents you can put your hands on.
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.
Good luck.
O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye
O come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold Him
Born the King of Angels
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?
Patience is a virtue, Roger.
Yes, I know, but the diggers can only work when the trap's open, and this is holding us up very badly.
- Is it finished?
- Of course.
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.
Mac.
Excellent.
Have it in by tomorrow night.
Christ the Lord
- Got a light?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?
I'll smoke it later, when I'm off duty.
Thank you.
You probably have a couple of roommates, huh?
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.
No, no. Red sky in the morning, sailor takes warning.
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.
It was a red sky last night.
I never heard that before.
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.
- You were a Boy Scout? So was I.
- Really?
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.
I was working on my 20th when the government abolished scouting and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.
Werner, you think you'll stay in the army after the war?
No. I'm not a well man.
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?
Yes. I could tell you stories about my teeth that would make your hair stand on end.
Our dentist here is a butcher.
But don't tell anyone I said so.
- It's a soldier's right to complain.
- Maybe in your army, but here?
One little criticism, and... to the Russian front.
Is that so? Terrible.
That's terrible.
Werner.
Why don't we go into my room?
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...
I was just gonna make some coffee.
Real coffee.
Coffee, coffee, coffee.
Where is it?
Marmelade. Ist ja wunderbar.
My grandmother keeps sending me this stuff.
- Ach du lieber Gott, Schokolade.
- Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.
- Von Lugers Butter.
- Yeah. Keep it.
Nein. I must go.
It's OK. You can keep it.
We're friends.
With you in the cooler, will we be friends?
I must report this.
I don't understand you. Report what?
That you and I were chatting in my room?
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.
- I'll never be able to eat it all.
- Nein, ich muss jetzt weg.
I'm sorry. All right.
Forget it. Forget it.
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember, is the voice of the Nelles warbler.
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman, the masked shrike.
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.
The shrike impales his foes on the spikes of thorn bushes.
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the coloring.
Uniform black above, from head to tail.
A black rump, a black crown with a bold white flash, and a white line over the eye.
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country...
Hendley. Sit down.
You'll find drawing materials on the table.
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country, olive groves and gardens.
Well, Hendley, have you taken to birds, too, now?
Yeah. Stick around. You might learn something.
I have better things to do than draw birds.
The voice is a monotonous succession of scratchy, complaining notes.
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...
An Urlaubsschein. Permission to cross a frontier.
Here's another one.
Which one's the forgery?
- That one.
- That's right.
They both are.
What's holding us up now is the new form of this travel permit.
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.
And a military identity card.
And a...
- An Ausweis.
- Yeah.
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.
What appears to be the ferret assignments for the next week.
You get ten out of ten for this, old boy.
Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?
- It's on loan.
In order to get the right amount of outfits, Roger,
I suggest that we work mainly from service uniforms.
I can do double-breasteds, single-breasteds, and rather nice lounge suits.
Lapels. I can do quite a lot of things with those.
I can have them deep like that, or high ones like that.
Here's one that we're working on right now.
Oh, yes. What about buttons?
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.
And, uh... here's one that I dyed with a bottle of blue ink.
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?
The goons'd have a field day if they crashed in on this lot.
That's Sorren's department.
Now, I've started working on the other materials.
This blanket.
Particularly the stripes. Marvelous.
- Coats.
- Yes.
I've got the chaps working on these all over the compound.
Those battle dresses,
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.
I'll have to get the chaps to make those into some sort of working man's outfits.
Blanket ticking.
Now, I've made these into rather nice little Waistcoats.
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.
Just take a look at this, Roger.
Now, this blanket material, we scrape this down until it's really smooth, and then dye it with boot polish.
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.
Good morning, Hilts.
Well, if you're here to find out if I'm going out again, I am.
- When?
- Seventeen days, 7th of July.
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.
- Is Ives going with you?
- Yeah, if he wants to.
You, uh... You know that Ives is close to cracking?
Yeah.
Better for him to go out in the tunnel, huh?
Safer.
Right.
It's possible for one man to get out through the wire, even get away, but there are in fact a considerable number of people besides yourself in this camp who are trying to escape.
I appreciate that.
Something's coming, I can feel it, and it's coming right around the corner at me, Squadron Leader.
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.
Yes, well... as I was saying, uh, Hilts, we have maps of Germany, general maps, that is.
We have all the information we need for the escape routes out of Germany.
But what we do not have... is a clear idea of what's 500 yards beyond those trees.
We've tried every goon in the camp. No go.
We must know the exact position of the local town.
We want to know where we hit the main roads.
Where the police stations are, where they've got their roadblocks.
And, most important of all, we've got to know how to get from here to the railway station.
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,
I'm not gonna be making maps for you guys.
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear if they're shooting at me with howitzers.
- Understandable.
- Completely.
I mean, I'd like to help, but...
Interesting idea.
- How many you taking out?
- Two hundred and fifty.
Two hundred and fifty?
Yeah.
You're crazy. You too.
Two hundred and fifty guys just walking down the road, just like that.
Well, some on the road, some by train, some cross-country.
They'll have forged papers, clothes, maps, compasses, rations.
You're gonna alert every goon in the country.
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork is gonna be out looking for you.
They're gonna swoop down and scoop you up so fast it'd make your head swim.
Yes, well... thanks, anyway.
If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.
- Any time.
Wait a minute.
You aren't seriously suggesting that if I get through the wire and case everything out there and don't get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown back in the cooler so you can get the information you need?
Yes. One has to ask some very strange things in the job I have.
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.
Check.
- Herr Hendley, I...
- Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.
What's the matter, Werner?
My wallet, my papers, my identity card.
Gone. I lost them. Everything.
He lost his wallet.
Do you realize what would happen if Strachwitz found this out?
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.
I've looked every place, every place.
I must have lost them while I was in here.
- No.
- Yes.
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.
Werner.
Not now. It might look a little peculiar if you and I were seen probing around at this time of night.
Look, I'll find them.
I promise you I'll find 'em if I have to tear this room apart.
- Thank you.
- Forget it.
- Werner.
- Yes?
There is one small favor.
A camera.
We want to take some snapshots.
You know... keepsakes.
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.
Focal-plane shutter.
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.
Let me know when you got it.
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid, that Werner, but I like him.
Checkmate.
How soon's our air pump going to be ready?
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.
- No good?
- Today, three times.
Willie, you all right? Pull!
You're gonna have to shore up the whole bloody tunnel, Roger.
- All 335 feet of it.
- Four times today.
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.
It's a lot of timber, Roger.
Can you get it?
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.
I'll put Hendley on it, and the new man we got this morning.
OK, Willie.
On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me
A partridge in a pear tree
On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the fourth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the fifth day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Five gold rings
How's it going with the rafters up there?
Taking out one in four.
Stay with it.
Five gold rings
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
On the seventh day of Christmas my true love sent to me
Seven swans a-swimming, six geese a-laying
Five gold rings
Four calling birds, three French hens
Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
Five gold rings, four calling birds...
Bloody singing.
I've never worked so hard in all my life.
Hi, Hilts.
Say, Cavendish...
Three French hens, two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear...
Allez... hup!
Never mind.
Here's a present from our friend, Werner.
Splendid. Simply splendid.
This should do very nicely.
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.
He requested permission to dispose of some of his dirt in our attic.
Tom has reached just beyond that pile of wood, sir.
Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?
- We make it 50 feet, sir.
- Dark of the moon is the seventh...
- Eight and ninth.
A day earlier in August.
Morning.
There he goes again.
Why is he buying up all the potatoes in the camp?
I've been working on that, but I can't find out.
Hilts and Hendley lock themselves in every night.
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.
Put the entire effort into Tom, and press on into the trees.
Right, Roger.
About face!
Forward march!
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.
It's the Fourth of July.
What the devil's this?
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.
- Quite right, too.
- And a little drink to Tom.
- And to getting home.
- Very well. We accept.
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!
Gentlemen, follow us.
About face!
Company... halt!
All right, let's line up down here!
All right, grab a cup!
Line it up! Here we go.
That explains what happened to the potatoes.
No harm in closing down Tom for one day, Roger.
I suppose it'll do us all good to let off a bit of steam.
There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and you can feel it throughout the whole camp.
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?
Moonshine. American moonshine. Moonshine.
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.
Keep it moving.
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.
- There you go.
- Down with the British.
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?
- Keep it moving.
- Don't get any on your clothes, sir.
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.
Get good and stoned, my friend.
Keep it going. Keep it...
No taxation without representation.
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...
Keep it going, fellas.
Enjoy yourselves.
- Well, let's drink to Tom.
- To Tom.
In the three years, seven months and two weeks that I've been in the bag, that's the most extraordinary stuff
I've ever tasted.
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.
Call on Ives.
Cheers, Hendley!
You know what that is?
I'll tell you what it isn't.
It isn't Napoleon brandy.
How do you like it, sir?
- Well, it's, uh...
- To the colonies.
Independence.
How are you managing over there without us?
Getting along all right, are you?
We seem to be getting along all right, shir... sir.
Yes, well, it's, uh...
It's good stuff, Hilts.
Thank you, sir.
Danny! Here's to...
Roger, goons in 105.
- Who?
- Strachwitz.
We have to ignore it.
If we pay attention, the goons'll know the hut's important.
Here's to going home.
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.
Home!
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you in the tunnel with us. To Tom.
Never mind.
You'll be walking down Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realize that myself.
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.
We're nearly at the trees.
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!
Das ist es also.
Los, holen Sie die Wache!
Ich hab's doch geahnt.
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.
It's the tunnel.
Success.
- Ives!
- Halt! Halt!
Halt!
Sir, let me know the exact information you need.
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.
Open up, Harry. We dig.
Around the clock.
- Cooler.
- Right.
Well, I didn't think they'd catch him so soon.
He wasn't caught.
Hilts, welcome home.
Danny?
Danny?
Danny?
Are you all right, Danny?
Yes. All right.
All right. Bring some shovels.
I'm all right.
For God's sake, you've left out a whole eagle.
That's impossible.
Yes.
Four days' work up the bloody spout!
- I'm sorry, Colin.
- It's all right, Smithy.
It's getting late. You push off to bed.
I'll pack up here.
All right.
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.
I can't see a bloody thing.
Hut ab.
Sehr gut. In Ordnung. Danke schön.
- Bitte schön.
- Herein.
Heil Hitler.
- Wie heiben Sie?
- Erich Stressel, aus München.
Warum sind Sie hier?
Ich habe Urlaub bekommen.
Meine Mutter ist krank.
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up a suspect.
Don't fall for that old gag.
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.
Herein.
One, two, three, four, five.
Roger.
No, it's me.
How do you like the old escape suit?
Fine, fine.
Colin.
How do you like mine?
It looks splendid.
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.
Danny, we're getting out through the tunnel.
We're almost clear.
Please, Willie, let me alone.
I can't go in that tunnel anymore.
So I'm going out through the wire.
Danny, think. We're getting out, but not through the wire.
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.
- I go out now.
- No.
Danny, you go through that wire and you'll get killed.
Don't do that.
Willie...
Since I was a boy,
I hate... and feared little rooms, closets, caves.
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.
Because I must get out.
I hide the fear, and I dig.
But tomorrow night in the tunnel with all those men,
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head, and ruin the escape for everybody.
So I go now.
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.
All right.
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.
Well, how do you think we look?
Guten Abend, mein Herr.
Wie geht es Ihnen?
It's as bad as all that?
Colin, I want first of all to say that without you, we would not have been ready.
That's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.
What's the matter, Roger?
You can't go.
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.
Why?
You can't see your hand in front of your face.
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.
That's ridiculous.
That's ridiculous.
Never heard anything so absurd in my life.
I can see perfectly.
I can see perfectly!
I can see... that pin down there.
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?
Yes, of course.
Put the pin down there, will you?
All right.
All right. Come on. Come on. Sit down.
Sit down. It was a good try.
I hate these last-minute letdowns, but I've only just been told.
It's too risky for you.
Don't you think that's Colin's decision?
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.
We all know the score here.
Well, at least... most of us do.
Your idea of this escape is to start another front, to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.
But once we get past that wire and have them looking all over Germany for us, that mission is accomplished.
Afterwards, we have some ideas of our own.
You mean getting home?
- Back to your family?
- That's right.
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that, too?
I'm sure you have.
I know Colin has.
And, Roger, I have, too.
We think we can make it all the way.
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard to the escape. That must be my decision.
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.
No one has said you can't go.
That's true.
I have thought about the Gestapo.
But if you're asking me how far a commanding officer is allowed to go, or dare go, or should be permitted to play God,
I can't answer you.
But I can tell you a blind man is an unnecessary hazard to himself and the whole plan, and must therefore be eliminated from the operation.
Colin's not a blind man as long as he's with me, and he's going with me.
It's all right with you, Colin?
Oh, yes. Quite.
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape numbers to be altered accordingly.
Good night, gentlemen.
Actually... he's quite right.
He's completely right.
I really shouldn't go at all.
My eyes have been getting worse and worse lately.
I think they call it progressive myopia.
I can see things up here. Close to.
I can see to work, but, uh...
- you're just a blur.
- I know.
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.
Colin, do you have any tea?
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.
Splendid.
Raus.
- Hi, Hilts.
- Hey, Mac.
When?
Tonight. We thought they'd never let you out.
Me, too. Let's get at it.
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.
What time?
Only eight minutes now, Danny.
You OK?
Cavendish.
Griff, down there.
Goff, there.
Smith, Foles, third on the right.
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.
There are the lights.
Right on the tick, Danny.
Look down the tunnel, Danny.
It's lovely.
It's just like Blackpool at the height of the season.
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?
Yes. No.
I don't know.
It's time, Roger.
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.
It's all clear, sir.
All set, Roger.
Roger.
Good luck.
They're coming down the shaft now, Danny.
And then they'll be coming right up the tunnel.
Willie... I can't wait. I must get out.
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.
Danny, tell me what this is, and tell me quickly!
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.
Let me out. Let me out.
Take him out, Willie.
Take him out.
Danny? What is it?
Danny, what's going on?
It's all right, Sedgwick.
It's all right. We're going later.
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.
All right, Colin. Down you go.
Sit down. Feel the top rung of the ladder with your right foot. Got it?
Down you go.
Danny cut out, huh?
Willie took him up top.
Hilts, I, uh...
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.
Right.
Bartlett.
All right?
Hold onto yourself.
You're 20 feet short.
What do you mean?
Twenty feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.
The guard is between us and the lights.
How could that happen?
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!
We could postpone it.
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.
One chance.
When the guard goes to the far end, you might be able to move out.
I think I can make it to the woods, set up a signal when you're clear.
What about the towers?
They're gonna be watching the compound, not the woods.
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.
Send down 30 feet of rope!
Send down 30 feet of rope.
Send down 30 feet of rope!
- What?
- Thirty feet of rope!
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.
Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
I don't think so, sir.
He's over there.
Right. You go first, Eric.
I'm staying here till we get moving.
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.
Right.
Thank you.
- Good luck.
- Right.
We're moving.
Danny, they're moving through the tunnel now.
They're getting out.
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and came to England because you're a flier.
You came because you wanted to fly with us and fight the Germans.
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.
If you don't go through that tunnel, everything you've done will have been for nothing, nothing!
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.
- In here, Colin.
- Come on.
Sit down.
You're up, Sedgwick.
I'll take over.
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?
I wish he was home with his kangaroos.
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?
Hilts is on the other end of that rope in the woods.
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs, off you go, but keep Colin low.
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.
What's that?
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.
Come on, Colin.
We can get out when the lights go down.
Willie.
Willie!
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!
Get 'em out.
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.
Light the lamps down there!
There's been an air raid and they've cut the lights.
Danny, it's all right.
Listen to me!
Danny, look.
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.
What the hell's going on?
- You go.
- No. Danny.
Go.
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.
Get him out fast.
Come on.
Come on, Danny, move.
Up you go.
Give me your bag.
We're on the rope!
You and I had better get out, or we won't have a chance of any of the trains.
It's moving. We'll just have to pass the instructions from man to man.
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.
Ist da jemand?
- Hast du etwas gehört?
- Nein.
Come on, come on.
Come on.
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Get off! We're coming back!
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot of shooting going on up there.
Think they've been shooting them as they came out?
We would've heard the shots before.
- Pull!
- Wait for me.
Out.
Out.
Die Aufstellung, Herr Hauptmann.
- Sechsundsiebzig.
- Jawohl.
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.
Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!
Half the guys who missed their trains are piled up here.
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.
Makes quite a group.
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.
Merci.
Können Sie mich mitnehmen?
Aber gerne. Steigen Sie ein.
Danke schön.
Ihre Pässe, bitte.
Tallyho.
- Vous êtes Français?
- Oui.
Moi, aussi.
- Merci bien.
- Merci.
Tallyho.
- Sie reisen für eine Firma?
- Ja.
Für mein...
Fur mein Geschäft.
- Danke.
- Danke.
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.
All right.
I'll tell you when.
I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
That's quite exciting.
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.
Switzerland.
Hey!
Wo willst du hin? Komm mal her.
Wo willst du denn hin?
Zeig mal deinen Ausweis.
Bartlett.
Alles auf den Boden.
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- I, uh... I hadn't quite decided.
What information were you to collect on the way?
None.
What sabotage directions did you receive?
What have you done with your papers?
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?
All I did was escape from a prison camp.
You'd do the same if you'd been locked up for three years.
I wanted to get home.
I don't think you'll see your wife again.
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.
You're wearing civilian clothes.
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.
I dyed it with boot polish to cover some oil smears
I picked up when I was shot down.
And you lost your insignia over the years?
That's right.
Bringen Sie ihn zu den anderen.
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.
Hello, boys.
Hello.
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.
I wish I could say I was happy to see you again.
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.
There's a trainer out there I can fly.
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.
Colin, when I say go, crank this clockwise.
When the engine catches, don't move, or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.
Go!
Next stop, Switzerland!
- The Alps.
- Splendid.
Over this range, then 20 more minutes and we've got it made.
- What is it? Petrol?
- I don't know. We're losing power.
Go that way! I'll follow.
Hendley?
Colin!
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!
Colin... I'm sorry I fouled things up.
That's all right.
Thank you for... getting me... out.
Los, aufstehen.
Hände hoch.
Bonjour, messieurs.
Comment ça va? Ça va bien?
Bonjour.
Comme d'habitude, trois Pernod, n'est-ce pas?
Trois Pernod, Papa.
Café Suzette.
Oui.
- Et voilà, messieurs, les trois Pernod.
- Merci.
Deux...
Et trois. Et voilà de l'eau.
- Bon appétit, messieurs.
- Merci.
Monsieur. Téléphone pour vous.
- Téléphone pour moi?
- Oui, monsieur, téléphone.
Par ici.
Voilà, téléphone.
Merci.
Hello?
Hello?
Resistance.
Resistance?
You are English?
I'm Australian.
- Dites-moi...
- You can speak English. I understand.
Bloody good. I'm a British officer.
I've just escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.
I'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?
- Oui.
- Can you help me?
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.
Geheime Staatspolizei.
Ihren Ausweis, bitte.
- Français?
- Jawohl.
- Commerçant?
- Mais oui. Parlez-vous français?
- Un peu.
- Votre accent est très bon.
Je l'ai étudié dans l'école supérieure.
Très bien. Passez.
Au revoir, monsieur. Au revoir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Halt!
Zwei vom Lager sind getürmt. Engländer.
Los!
Alles einsteigen.
Einsteigen.
Halt! Halt!
Stehen bleiben! Hände hoch!
- Was soll das?
- You are English.
Engländer?
Sie drohen mir mit einer Pistole?
- Nehmen Sie die weg.
- Ach, Sie sind Deutscher?
- Selbstverständlich.
- Schon gut. Entschuldigung.
Herr Bartlett?
- Ich heibe Fröhlich.
- Your German is good.
And I hear also your French.
Your arms... up!
Ausgezeichnet!
Herr Bartlett... and Herr MacDonald.
We are together again.
You are going to wish you had never put us to so much trouble.
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.
I expected either a long stay or a very short trip.
Yes.
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried, though.
I hope to God I haven't blotted 70-odd ledgers.
No, no.
We're all over 21, footloose and fancy-free.
We'd never have got as far as we did without you, Roger.
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.
- I think we all do.
- Yes.
Was ist los? Wo sind wir?
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.
It will take hours before you reach the camp.
You know, Mac, all this, the organization, tunneling,
Tom and Harry, kept me alive.
And even though we...
I've never been happier.
You know, Mac...
Eleven of your men are being returned today.
- Oh, who?
- I do not have that information.
I...
I am directed by a higher authority to inform you that...
50 of your officers were shot while escaping.
Shot?
Their... personal effects will be returned.
How many of them were wounded?
Here are the names... of the dead.
How many of the 50 were wounded?
None. They, the higher authority... only directs me to inform you that... that 50 men were...
I see.
Addison, John.
Alladale, Peter.
Bancroft, Edward.
Bartlett, Roger.
Cavendish, Dennis.
Eldridge, David.
Felton, William.
Fanshaw, Arthur.
- Ici?
- Oui, monsieur. C'est ici.
Alors, au revoir.
- Merci beaucoup, monsieur.
- Pas de quoi. Au revoir.
- Au revoir.
- Bonne chance.
I am your guide, señor.
For Spain?
España.
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.
What happened to Blythe?
He didn't make it, sir.
Roger was right about that.
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.
I've just posted the list.
They shot... 50.
The Gestapo murdered them.
Fifty? MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?
No, they're not on the list.
- Haynes?
- Yes. I'm sorry.
Roger's idea was to get back at the enemy the hardest way he could.
Mess up the works.
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.
Do you think it was worth the price?
That depends on your point of view, Hendley.
Yes, sir.
Achtung!
Achtung!
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.
The job just didn't work out, huh?
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...
How many?
Fifty.
It looks, after all, as if you will see Berlin before I do.
Sir.
Hey, Hilts!

My congratulations, sir.
A brilliant coup.
Siamese fighting fish.
Fascinating creatures.
Brave, but, on the whole, stupid.
Yes, they're stupid.
Except for the occasional one, such as we have here, who lets the other two fight... while he waits.
Waits until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself.
Then, like SPECTRE, he strikes.
I find the parallel amusing.
Our organisation did not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement, Number Three.
Come in, Kronsteen.
Sit down, Number Three, while we listen to what Number Five has devised for us.
I hope his efforts as director of planning continue to be as successful as his chess.
They will be.
As you instructed,
I've planned for SPECTRE to steal from the Russians their new Lektor decoding machine.
For this we need the services of the
Russian Cryptograph Section in Turkey and the help of the British Secret Service.
Neither the Russians nor the British will be aware that they are working for us.
Number Three, is your section ready to carry out the directives?
Yes, the operation will be organised according to Kronsteen's plan.
I have selected a girl from the Russian Consulate in Istanbul.
She's capable, cooperative, and her loyalty to the state is beyond question.
You're sure she believes you're still head of operations for Soviet Intelligence?
It's most unlikely she would know
I'm now working for SPECTRE.
Moscow has kept my defection secret from everyone but the presidium.
For your sake, I hope so.
Kronsteen, you're sure this plan is foolproof?
Yes, because I have anticipated every possible variation of countermove.
But what makes you think that M will oblige you by falling in with your plan?
For the simple reason that this is so obviously a trap.
My reading of the British mentality is that they always treat a trap as a challenge.
And they couldn't possibly pass up the chance of getting the Lektor decoder.
They have wanted one for years.
All that you say could be true. What else?
SPECTRE will probably have the chance of a personal revenge for the killing of our operative Dr No, because the man the British will almost certainly use on a mission of this sort would be their agent, James Bond.
Let his death be a particularly unpleasant and humiliating one.
Good. I'll put my plan into operation straight away.
And there will be no failure.
(helicopter overhead)
Hurry.
Welcome to SPECTRE Island.
I hope you had a pleasant flight.
My time is limited.
Is the man I requested ready?
- His dossier.
- Good.
Donald Grant, convicted murderer.
Escaped Dartmoor Prison in 1960, recruited in Tangier in 1962.
Excellent.
Where is he now?
- At the lake.
- Bring him to my office, will you?
- Take me to the lake.
- Through the training area.
Grant's one of our best men.
Homicidal paranoiac, superb material.
His response to our training and indoctrination have been remarkable.
(gunfire)
I hope our work here meets with your approval.
Training is useful, but there is no substitute for experience.
I agree. We use live targets as well.
- Call him.
- Grant!
He seems fit enough. Have him report to me in Istanbul in 24 hours.
(speak Russian)
(speak Turkish)
Corporal of State Security
Tatiana Romanova.
Come in.
You know who I am?
Colonel Klebb, head of operations for SMERSH.
I saw you once in Moscow, when
I worked for the English decoding room.
Did you tell anyone you were coming here?
- No, the message...
- Yes, yes, I know. I sent it.
Your work record is excellent.
- The state is proud of you.
- Thank you, Comrade Colonel.
Take off your jacket.
Turn around.
You're a fine-Iooking girl.
Sit down.
I see you trained for the ballet.
But I grew an inch over the regulation height, and so...
And then you have had three lovers.
What is the purpose of such an intimate question?
You're not here to ask questions.
You forget to whom you are speaking.
- I was in love.
- And if you were not in love?
I suppose that would depend on the man.
Sensible answer.
This man, for instance.
I cannot tell.
Perhaps if he was kind and kulturny.
Corporal, I have selected you for a most important assignment.
Its purpose is to give false information to the enemy.
If you complete it successfully, you will be promoted.
From now on, you will do anything he says.
- And if I refuse?
- Then you will not leave this room alive.
- I will obey your orders.
- Good. Now, these are your instructions.
You report to me here, but the consulate security man must not know anything.
- This is classified far above his level.
- I will say nothing...
If you do, you will be shot.
Come, come, my dear.
You're very fortunate to have been chosen for such a simple, delightful duty.
A real labour of love, as we say.
(# "From Russia With Love" on radio)
- Great sport, this.
- What did you say?
I said it's great sport, this punting.
- I couldn't agree with him more.
- I may even give up golf for it.
Really?
Not quite.
Souvenir from another jealous woman?
Yes. But I haven't turned my back on one since.
(beeping)
- Excuse me.
- What?
- Give me my shirt.
- What's going on?
- I have to make a phone call.
- But we haven't eaten yet.
I'm starving.
Come in, Univex.
James Bond here. Over.
He's been asking for you all morning.
Where in the world are you, James?
Well, I've just been reviewing an old case.
- So I'm an old case now, am I?
- It's the office.
- Tell him I'm on my way, will you?
- He is not on his way.
Sylvia, behave. We'll do this again some other time soon.
Do what? Last time you said that, you went off to Jamaica.
I haven't seen you for six months.
- I'll be there in an hour.
- I'll tell him.
Hey. Your old case sounds interesting, James.
Make that an hour and a half.
Now, about that lunch.
For my next miracle, I...
It'll be a miracle if he can explain where he's been all day.
But I've never even heard of a Tatiana Romanova.
- Ridiculous, isn't it?
- It's absolutely crazy.
Of course, girls do fall in love with pictures of film stars.
But not a Russian cipher clerk with a file photo of a British agent.
Unless she's mental.
No, it's some sort of trap.
Obviously it's a trap, and the bait is a cipher machine, a brand-new Lektor.
A Lektor, no less. The CIA's been after one of those for years.
Yes, so have we.
When she contacted Kerim Bey, head of Station T in Turkey, and told him she wanted to defect, she said she'd turn it over to us.
On one condition.
That you went out to Istanbul and brought her and the machine back to England.
Here's a snapshot Kerim managed to get of her.
I don't know too much about cryptography, but a Lektor could decode their top secret signals.
The whole thing's so fantastic it just could be true.
That had occurred to me.
Besides, the Russians haven't been up to any tricks recently.
Well, really, I'm not too busy at the moment, sir.
You're booked on the 8.30 plane in the morning.
If there's any chance of us getting a Lektor, we must look into it.
Suppose when she meets me in the flesh
I don't come up to expectations?
Just see that you do.
Miss Moneypenny, ask the equipment officer to come in, please.
Q Branch has put together a smart-Iooking piece of luggage for us.
We're issuing this to all double-0 personnel.
An ordinary black leather case with
20 rounds of ammunition here and here.
Now, if you take the top off, you'll find the ammunition inside.
In the side here, a flat throwing knife.
Press that button there, and out she comes.
Inside the case, you'll find an AR7 folding sniper's rifle.
.25 calibre, with an infrared telescopic sight.
Then, if you pull out these straps, inside are 50 gold sovereigns, 25 in either side.
Now, watch very carefully.
An ordinary tin of talcum powder.
Inside, a tear-gas cartridge. That goes in the case against the side here.
It's magnetised, so it won't fall.
Shut the case.
Normally, to open a case like that, you move the catches to the side.
If you do, the cartridge will explode in your face.
Now, to stop the cartridge exploding, turn the catches horizontally, like that.
Then, open normally.
Now you try it.
- Turn the catches like that.
- That's right.
And open ordinarily.
- You got it?
- Yes, I think so.
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes, thanks very much.
Nasty little Christmas present.
But I shouldn't need it on this assignment.
All the same, take it with you.
Good luck, 007.
Thank you, sir.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
And one plane ticket. Lucky man.
I've never been to Istanbul.
- You've never been to Istanbul?
- No.
Where the moonlight on the Bosphorus is irresistible?
Maybe I should get you to take me there someday. I've tried everything else.
Darling Moneypenny, you know
I never even look at another woman.
Really, James?
Let me tell you the secret of the world.
(buzzing)
Miss Moneypenny,
ask 007 to leave the photograph.
I'm sure he'll recognise
the lady when he sees her.
- Good luck.
- Ciao.
Ciao.
Hello, London.
Your flight PA1 just landed Istanbul.
Mr Bond.
- Kerim Bey sent a car for you, sir.
- Fine.
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.
- It's better still.
- Until they go wrong.
- Exactly.
- I'll get the car, sir.
Kerim Bey suggested that you see him before going to the hotel.
- Would that be convenient?
- Fine.
I suppose it's customary to have people tailing you in these parts.
Oh, yes.
Today it's Citroën H31854 on duty.
Bulgarians working for the Russians.
They follow us, we follow them.
- It's a sort of understanding we have.
- That's very friendly.
Ah, my friend, come in, come in.
Glad to see you. Welcome to Istanbul.
Thank you for sending the car.
But it does rather tie you in with me.
You're in the Balkans now. The game with the Russians is played differently.
For routine matters, we don't make it too difficult to keep a tab on each other.
So I gathered from your chauffeur.
He's a rather intelligent young man.
He should be. He's my son.
- Coffee?
- Medium sweet.
Two medium sweet.
He also is my son.
All my key employees are my sons.
Blood is the best security in this business.
- You must have quite an establishment.
- Biggest family payroll in Turkey.
Not bad for a man who used to break chains and bend bars in a circus.
- But let's talk about your business.
- M thinks I'm wasting my time here.
And so do I.
This is an old friend of mine.
- And it tells me something smells.
- Maybe.
But if there's a chance of getting a Lektor...
Now you tell me.
Where can I contact this girl?
She said she would make her own arrangements. You'll have to wait.
Thank you.
My friend, if you really want my advice, you should spend a few pleasant days with us here in Istanbul, then go home.
- James Bond, I have a reservation.
- Your room is ready.
Number 32.
- 32 for Mr Bond.
- Hope you enjoy your stay.
Thank you.
(porter clears throat)
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Only this. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Mr Bond here.
I'm afraid the room won't do.
- The bed's too small.
- One moment, sir. Did you hear that?
Tell him that's all there is.
Unless he would like the bridal suite.
I'm sorry, sir. That's all we have available, except the bridal suite.
Well, let's have a look at it.
I may like it.
The porter will show it to you.
He will be up immediately.
Good.
Good work. Who can the Russians suspect but the British?
The Cold War in Istanbul will not remain cold very much longer.
Ali Kerim Bey...
- Ali Kerim Bey.
- Mm.
Ali Kerim Bey.
You are not glad to see me this morning?
Overjoyed.
I no longer please you?
Be still.
Back to the salt mines.
Careful with those papers.
- Well, who won?
- I had visitors.
Limpet mine on the wall outside.
Timed to catch me at my desk.
But, by good fortune, I was relaxing on the settee for a few moments.
- The girl left in hysterics.
- Found your technique too violent?
I can't understand this sudden breach of the truce. It's unlike the Russians.
Most inconsiderate. My visit might have something to do with it.
Let's try and find out.
Close up afterwards.
Quite a place.
The Emperor Constantine built it as a reservoir 1600 years ago.
Really?
Here.
My daily exercise: At eleven in the morning and three in the afternoon.
Tie her up, will you?
Mind your head now.
Underneath the Russian Consulate.
A present from your navy.
Our friends were turned out by the Public Works Ministry.
The story was that the heavy traffic was shaking the foundations.
By the time the place was declared safe,
I had this installed.
I can see everything
M said about you is right.
You know why I stay in this mad business?
It could be that you find selling rugs a bore.
My friend, you should be a mind-reader.
Head of the table is General Vassili, director of Military Intelligence.
On his left:
Koslovski, Chief of Security.
Opposite him:
Benz, one of his agents.
I can't see the face of the other man, the one the general is shouting at.
- He's giving him a hell of a blowing up.
- It's too bad we can't hear as well as see.
Tell me. Does our girl Romanova ever come to this room?
Sometimes, with messages.
I can see the face of the other man now.
Krilencu.
So he's back.
Another Bulgarian they use as a killer.
Just the man for the limpet mine job.
I've had trouble with him before.
But he's stayed out of Istanbul for over a year now.
Take a look.
You should remember him.
This man kills for pleasure.
Nice face.
Just a moment.
A girl's just come in.
Probably Romanova.
She's the only one who's allowed to.
How does she look to you?
From this angle, things are shaping up nicely.
I'd like to see her in the flesh. Yes.
- Could you get me a plan of that place?
- I wish I could.
But there must be the original drawing somewhere.
I'll get onto that.
Now, I need a little time to deal with this stinking Krilencu.
It will be better if you didn't stay at the hotel tonight. Come.
I see now why you keep the Rolls.
One of my sons is driving it.
With two dummies in the back.
In the opposite direction.
They'll follow it for hours.
You'll like my Gypsy friends.
I use them like the Russians the Bulgars.
It's created a blood feud between them.
(music)
Hello, Krilencu.
(speaks Russian)
(man addresses Kerim Bey)
It seems we've come on the wrong night.
Two girls in love with the same man have threatened to kill each other.
As I'm an old friend of the family, we can stay.
We're bidden to table. I hope you are good at eating with your fingers.
Kerim Bey!
Raki. Filthy stuff.
Quick.
Tell our host his hospitality overwhelms me.
Thank you. Thank you.
No matter what happens now, say and do nothing.
(man makes announcement)
He's asking whether they will cease their blood feud.
The elders of the tribe will then decide who will marry the chief's son.
- She's saying...
- I think I got it without the subtitles.
(gunshots)
Thank you!
- Did you get Krilencu?
- No.
Just a minute.
Here. Thank you.
You fought well.
I am nothing but a clumsy old man.
(man screams)
They're making one of the wounded Bulgars talk.
(man addresses Kerim Bey)
It was me they were after.
Why would they want me out of the way?
Tomorrow we will have to find
Krilencu's hide-out.
- Meantime, I'll take care of this filthy stuff.
- (man speaks to Bond)
Vavra thanks you for saving his life.
You are now his son.
Thank you.
I'd like to ask him a favour.
Could he stop the girl fight?
Your heart is too soft to be a real Gypsy.
But he lets you decide the matter.
As if I didn't have enough problems.
Vavra said for you to decide. So decide.
They're both yours.
This might take some time.
- Did you pick up the package?
- It's on the seat.
Thank you.
Twice that Krilencu has tried to kill me.
The third time he will succeed.
Unless I get him first.
And that I'll do tonight.
Not with that arm, you won't.
You'd better leave it to me.
- I'm already too much in your debt.
- How can a friend be in debt?
Here.
Infrared lens.
Shh.
(footsteps)
My sons.
They will ring his doorbell.
He has a private escape hatch.
Try this for size.
- Do you notice anything?
- Not yet.
She has a lovely mouth, that Anita.
Yes, I see what you mean.
Arm or no arm,
I have to pull that trigger.
If you think you can.
You've got one shot, remember.
It'll have to do.
Quick. He's coming.
Quick.
Aah!
That pays many debts.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
Hello?
Breakfast for one at nine please.
Green figs, yoghurt, coffee - very black. Thank you.
(sniffs)
(creaking)
(creaking)
You look surprised.
I thought you were expecting me.
So you are Tatiana Romanova?
My friends call me Tania.
Mine call me James Bond.
Well, now that we've been properly introduced...
Careful. Guns upset me.
I'm sorry.
I'm a bit upset myself.
You look just like your... your photograph.
You're one of the most beautiful girls ever.
Thank you, but I think my mouth is too big.
No, it's the right size.
For me, that is.
Yes.
- Is it here?
- What?
The decoding machine. Lektor.
Must we talk about it now?
Or is it at the Russian Consulate?
Yes.
Yes... I would need a plan of the place.
If you could get one, we could meet at the Saint Sophia mosque as tourists.
Why don't you ask me that later?
- Now what are you looking for?
- The scar.
You see?
I know all about you from your file.
You do? Well,
I hope you're not disappointed.
I will tell you... in the morning.
We are now approaching the most interesting corner of Saint Sophia.
Including these two great red porphyry columns, stolen and brought from Egypt.
In front of them, alabaster urn was brought from Bergama, a famous historical city near Smyrna.
It dates back from the Alexander the Great period.
About 1648 Sultan Murad IV brought it from Bergama.
It was used as an ablution fountain.
It contains a thousand litres of water.
Right after the ablution fountain, we are going to a highly interesting column over there, known for centuries as the Saint Sophia wishing column.
Tens of thousands of people have wished here, putting their right hand and middle finger in the hole.
I promise you - it wasn't one of my men who killed him.
He didn't die of old age.
All I know is that it saved me the job.
Once he'd seen the girl, she was compromised, and so...
And he wasn't killed because of that.
Let's just say that Istanbul's a rough town.
Let's see how Tania's map compares with your architect's plans.
This is conference room of the Russian Consulate. That checks.
And this here is the communication room.
That's the same.
And she says she works there with the Lektor between two and three.
- How is she gonna get the machine to us?
- She'll do anything I say.
Anything.
My dear James, you're not using this.
It all sounds too easy. We don't even know if she's telling the truth.
- I intend to find out.
- Where? In the hotel?
No. She won't go there again.
She says it's too dangerous.
The old game.
Give a wolf a taste, then keep him hungry.
My friend, she's got you dangling.
That doesn't matter.
- All I want is that Lektor.
- AII?
Are you sure that's all you want?
Well...
- Lovely view.
- James, we must leave here now.
- If that agent reports my meeting you...
- Don't worry. He won't.
But you don't understand the danger.
- James, look up.
- Smile.
Another one. Further back.
- About the machine...
- That's all you are interested in. Not me.
Business first.
I know, once you have got what you want...
I haven't got it yet.
But, afterwards, we won't always be working on the company's time.
All right. What do you want to know?
Talk into this.
Answer my questions quietly, but clearly.
How large is the machine?
Like... like a typewriter.
- Weight?
- About ten kilos.
In a brown case.
Brown like your eyes.
Keep it technical.
Self-calibrating or manual?
Both, with an in-built compensator.
- James, couldn't we...
- Not now.
Talk into the camera.
How many keys?
- Symbol or code keys?
- Both.
There are 24 symbols and 16 code keys.
It is inserted in a slot and
the message comes out in a paper roll
from another slot on the other side.
The mechanism is...
Oh, James, James, will you
make love to me all the time in England?
Day and night.
Go on about the mechanism.
Oh, yes, the mechanism.
Once, when it was being repaired,
I saw the insides.
There were many perforated discs,
made I think of copper, with a small light.
Dushka, tell me the truth, am I
as exciting as all those Western girls?
Once, when I was with M in Tokyo,
we had an interesting experience.
Thank you, Miss Moneypenny.
That's all, that's all.
Later, later.
- Those copper discs and the light...
- Oh, the light, the light.
James, come closer.
I want to whisper something.
Go on. No, not that.
The mechanism.
(M) Miss Moneypenny, as you're no doubt
listening, perhaps you'd take this cable?
"Merchandise appears genuine. Stop.
Go ahead with deal." Signed, M.
Now all I have to do is to tell the girl the date.
- The 13th?
- The 14th.
Visas?
Visas? Thank you.
Visa, please.
Your clock, is it correct?
- Always.
- Of course.
Excuse me.
You did say your clock was correct?
Russian clocks are always...
- Is this the Lektor?
- Yes.
(coughs)
- Take this.
- It thought it was for tomorrow.
- Today is the 13th, isn't it?
- It's a hell of a time to be superstitious.
Come on. Quickly.
(sirens)
Keep your head down.
Argh!
Back inside.
This way. Quickly.
- What's the matter?
- Benz, the Russian security man.
Come on. Never mind.
Hurry. Hurry.
(speak Russian)
Here's one of them.
And there's the other one.
Your passports.
The pictures do not do you justice.
I have rarely seen a handsomer couple.
Mr and Mrs David Somerset.
- Your name's Caroline.
- Caroline. I like that name.
You're accompanying me on a business trip on our way home.
- To our children?
- No children.
- Not even one little boy?
- Nyet.
I like big families. My whole life has been a crusade for larger families.
- So I heard. Tania?
- Yes?
Keep the door locked.
I'll knock three times.
OK.
- I'll go see the conductor.
- You're sure he'll cooperate?
We've done business before.
He'll stop the train near the frontier, where my sons will be waiting with a car.
- We'll be there about six o'clock.
- And the airstrip?
20 miles.
The plane is chartered to Athens.
You'll be in London tomorrow.
We'll drink to that in London.
So, we are really on our way to England.
Yes, with a lovely two-day honeymoon before us.
Honeymoon? And I've nothing to wear.
- Your trousseau.
- Oh, James.
One moment.
Oh. Oh, no. James, James!
Oh, look, look.
There.
(hums)
I will wear this one in Piccadilly.
You won't.
They've just passed some new laws there.
- You're nearest.
- Oh, all right.
Charming. Charming.
Let's go to the restaurant car,
James, for that drink.
Surely.
Charming.
We'll continue the fashion show later.
Everything's arranged for me to stop the train. We'll get off at the restaurant car.
Fine. We'll meet you there at six.
Make it just a little later.
But there are complications.
One of the Russian security men,
Benz, he's on the train.
But he wouldn't have had time to contact the consulate.
Just in case, I'll keep him company until it's time to get off.
- Perhaps you'd like me to introduce you.
- Charming.
(knock)
Ticket control.
Do not be alarmed. We will make you as comfortable as possible.
Now I'm sure Commissar Benz will have a much safer journey.
I'm not mad about his tailor, are you?
You know, James, life in Istanbul will never be the same without you.
See you in the restaurant car.
I've had a particularly fascinating life.
Would you like to hear about it?
You would?
(knocking)
- You like it?
- Yes, it does rather suit you.
- I will save everything else for England.
- It is four o'clock, you know.
This is not kulturny in the afternoon?
Even on a honeymoon?
Then I will take it off.
I think we're talking at cross purposes again.
- Tania.
- Mm-hm?
We'd better get dressed now.
- Why?
- It's almost six.
So?
Well, it's teatime.
We'll have it in here.
- We'll have all our meals here.
- Yes, that would be splendid.
But I've arranged to meet Kerim in the restaurant car.
You go alone. I will stay here.
My dear Mrs Somerset, we're supposed to be a respectable English couple.
They would certainly have tea in the restaurant.
Now listen...
- Just do as I say, will you?
- Yes, James.
But there are some English customs that are going to be changed.
But of course, darling.
Do I look right, Mr Somerset?
Yes...
- Mrs Somerset.
- (in Russian) How pretty.
Mr Somerset. Mr Somerset.
- You are the friend of Kerim Bey?
- Yes?
There's been a terrible accident.
Please come with me.
- No tea?
- Later. Keep the door locked.
They killed each other.
- This must be kept quiet until Trieste.
- It will be difficult.
I'm sure.
Kerim Bey had many influential friends.
I'm sure they also will reward you.
I will try.
(knocking)
What is it?
- Kerim's dead.
- Dead?
I want the truth.
- James, you are hurting me.
- I'll do worse if you don't tell me.
You're doing this under orders, I know.
What are they?
- I don't know what you mean.
- Liar.
Even if you kill me, I can say nothing.
I did not know anything like Kerim's death would happen.
But when we get to England, I tell you.
- Go on.
- Oh, no.
Maybe they didn't let you in on all of it, but whatever you do know, tell me.
- I know I love you, James. I love you.
- Just tell me.
I love you, I love you, it's true.
Sure.
Belgrade. Belgrade.
Excuse me.
- Can I borrow a match?
- I use a lighter.
- Better still.
- Until they go wrong.
My brother telephoned me.
Why did the train not stop?
Well, I have some bad news.
Your father's dead.
Who did it? Tell me.
He took care of that himself.
The other man died first.
Now listen...
I'll need help to get across the frontier between Yugoslavia and Trieste.
I want you to send a message to M in London:
Tell him to send someone from Station Y to meet me in Zagreb.
I will.
Good.
Oh.
You'II... I think you'll want these.
- Monsieur Somerset, le train part.
- Thank you.
- Captain Nash.
- Bond, travelling as Somerset.
My card.
- What kept you?
- I only got M's wire an hour ago.
I busted every record getting here.
- What were M's orders?
- To contact you and the lady on the train.
Good. Come this way.
Thank you.
(knocking)
This is my wife Caroline.
Captain Nash.
How do you do?
I'm so pleased to meet you.
- This way, Nash. Sit down, will you?
- Thank you.
- Been long in Yugoslavia?
- About three years.
- Interesting work?
- Yes, sometimes.
You know how it is, old man.
- You look very fit, Nash.
- Yes, I try to keep in shape.
So what's our problem, sir?
I can't risk taking this through the customs at the Yugoslav-Trieste border.
No stops till then.
We'd have to jump off.
- Can you get us across?
- Any of the opposition around?
- Not in any condition to worry about.
- Good. We'll make it.
I know this territory like the back of my hand.
Do you mind if we have a bite to eat?
I've been on the go since breakfast.
No, of course not.
We'll go to the restaurant car.
Caroline, you go with Nash.
I'll join you there in a few minutes.
Whatever you say, old man.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
There you are, old man.
I was worried something had happened to you.
- Voilà, monsieur.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
I'll have the grilled sole.
And for madam.
What about you, Nash?
Yes, that sounds very nice.
Make that three of those, will you?
- I'll have a bottle of Blanc de Blancs.
- Make mine chianti.
- White chianti?
- No, the red kind.
Well, enjoy your dinner, old man.
I've got the answer to our problems.
Very simple, really.
Good.
We should reach the border in about an hour.
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs Somerset.
That was clumsy of me.
- Waiter.
- Monsieur.
- Waiter.
- Tout de suite, monsieur.
- Excuse me. Merci.
- You'll find Trieste quite interesting.
Of course, it's not London.
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.
I don't feel very well.
My head...
- The lady's come over faint.
- Bring her in here.
What is wrong with me?
- Let's go next door.
- Exhaustion, I'd say.
What was it, the stuff you put in her drink?
Chloral hydrate.
Quick, but mild.
- And?
- Take it easy, 007.
My escape route's only for one.
What are you after, the girl or the Lektor?
All right.
- What is your plan?
- Explain it better on a map. All right?
Now, we're here, you see?
When we reach there, there's a steep gradient. The train slows down there.
We'll block the line, make for that main road, pick up a car.
A truck, in fact.
That must be about 20 miles from here...
Keep still.
All right, now. Get up on your knees.
Put your hands in your pockets.
Keep them there.
Red wine with fish.
That should have told me something.
You may know the right wines, but you're the one on your knees.
How does it feel, old man?
Old man? Is that what you chaps in SMERSH call each other?
SMERSH?
Of course. SPECTRE.
It wasn't a Russian show at all.
You've been playing us off against each other, haven't you?
It was SPECTRE who killed the Russian agent in the mosque.
- You?
- Mm-hm.
- Kerim and the other man?
- Mm-hm.
And Nash?
I don't mind talking.
I get a kick out of watching James Bond find out what a bloody fool he's been.
We're pros, Mr Bond.
We sweated your recognition code out of one of your men in Tokyo before he died.
I've been keeping tabs on you.
I've been your guardian angel.
Saved your life at the Gypsy camp.
Oh, yes.
I'm much obliged.
We were keeping you alive until you could get us the Lektor.
So you had me deliver it on a plate.
That's brilliant.
Go on. I'm fascinated.
Now that we've got it, you and the girl are expendable.
Between here and Trieste.
The girl?
- Isn't she working for SPECTRE, too?
- No.
She thinks she's doing it all for Mother Russia.
She takes her orders from Colonel Klebb.
Rosa Klebb's Russian.
Head of operations for SMERSH.
Was.
Klebb works for SPECTRE now.
The girl doesn't know that.
- Then why kill her?
- Orders.
That's only half of it, old man.
Here's a roll of film.
She'll have this in her handbag.
And on you, they'll find this letter.
It's from her, threatening to give the film to the press unless you marry her for helping you get the Lektor.
What film?
Taken in the bridal suite at your hotel.
Something else the girl didn't know about. Or you.
It must be a pretty sick collection of minds to dream up a plan like that.
Can't you see the headlines?
"British agent murders beautiful
Russian spy, then commits suicide."
Tell me, which lunatic asylum did they get you out of?
Don't make it tougher on yourself.
My orders are to kill you and deliver the Lektor.
How I do it is my business.
- It'll be slow and painful.
- How much are they paying you?
- What's it to you?
- We'll double it.
Your word of honour?
As an English gentleman?
The first one won't kill you.
Not the second.
Not even the third.
Not till you crawl over here and you kiss my foot.
- How about a cigarette?
- Not a chance.
I'll pay for it.
- What with?
- 50 gold sovereigns.
- Where are they?
- Up there, in my case.
You show me.
Here you are.
What about that cigarette?
Throw 'em down there.
Any more in the other case?
I should imagine so. It's standard kit.
I'll have a look.
Put your hands back in your pockets.
Keep them there.
You won't be needing this... old man.
Tania. Wake up.
Wake up, or I'll leave you behind.
Tania, wake up or I'll leave you behind, do you hear me?
Don't leave me. Never leave me.
Tania, this is Nash's escape route.
You understand?
We've got to get off here.
Take this. Come on.
We must get to the other side of the train.
Under here.
(whistles)
Grant, where are you? Grant?
Excuse me.
Now, don't run away.
Come on.
- Come on, or I'll leave you here.
- Stay here with me.
Sleep it off in there.
You'll feel better in the morning.
Come on, wake up.
Try and straddle the truck.
I'll get them away from here.
You hide under the truck.
I'd say one of their aircraft is missing.
Tania.
- Here, take this, and cast the rope off.
- All right.
Where's the key? Where's the key?
In my coat. In the pocket.
All right, get out. Move.
In the boat.
Do you swim?
Take the wheel.
This way, please.
Mind the step.
Just isn't your day, is it?
- Where are we going?
- Venice.
Take a look at that locker, will you?
Charts, pistol, some flares.
Give me those charts.
Yes, we're here, near Istria.
We've got plenty of fuel.
With luck we should be there by morning.
Three man were found dead on the train at Trieste. One of them was Grant.
What have you to say, Number Five?
He was Klebb's choice.
Her people failed.
It was your plan.
They followed it implicitly.
Impossible. It was perfect.
Except for one thing:
They were dealing with Bond.
Who is Bond compared with Kronsteen?
Exactly. What have you to say to that, Number Three?
Bond is still alive and the Lektor is not yet in our possession.
I have already negotiated with the Russians to return it to them.
We've agreed a price. And SPECTRE always delivers what it promises.
Our whole organisation depends on our keeping those promises.
I warned you. We do not tolerate failure,
Number Three. You know the penalty.
Yes, Number One.
Our rules are very simple. If you fail...
12 seconds. One day we must invent a faster-working venom.
- Number Three.
- Yes?
I do not wish to tell the Russians there will be another delay.
There will be no delay, Number One.
There's still time.
- Which way are we going?
- The shortest route.
Which is between those two mountains and straight along the coast.
Ahoy, Mr Bond. Ahoy, Mr Bond.
Heave to. Heave to.
You're trapped, Mr Bond.
You're trapped.
You cannot escape. You cannot escape.
Prepare to fire.
We're coming through. Pull over,
SPECTRE Green. Get out of the way!
Give them a warning shot.
Rifle grenade, fire.
Forward machine gun, fire.
You're firing too close.
SPECTRE Red, SPECTRE Green,
you're firing too close.
You're trying to stop them,
not to sink them.
Here, take the wheel.
Slow down.
Slow down. Slow down all boats.
Green, go alongside while we keep you covered.
Hands up, Mr Bond.
- Without the drums we can go faster.
- Hand me the Very pistol.
Keep your hands up. We're sending
a boat along to take you off.
There's a saying in England,
"Where there's smoke, there's fire."
Green, change your course.
Go astern.
All boats, throw out your ammunition.
Get rid of it, quick.
Get rid of it.
Jump.
(phone)
Don't go away.
Yes.
Oh, thanks. Tell him to wait, will you?
And send up a porter for the luggage.
Avanti.
- Permesso, signore?
- Sì, prego.
And also get me the British Consul.
Thank you.
(phone)
Yes? Oh, Mr Maxwell, please.
James Bond.
James, we will miss the plane.
And we will...
Hello, Paul? Bond here.
I wanted to thank you for everything.
Signal the office we're on our way back, will you? What was that?
Here, leave that. I'll take it.
What? Oh, no.
Should be routine from here on in.
- Hello, what was that you were saying?
- Klebb.
James, you still there? Hello?
Romanova, the door.
Romanova!
Take this.
Horrible woman.
Yes. She's had her kicks.
# From Russia with love
# I'd fly to you...
Here you are.
In case you ever need it again.
Oh, yes. All government property has to be accounted for.
But as I said before, we won't always work on the company's time, will we?
No.
# I've travelled the world...
James, behave yourself.
We are being filmed.
Oh, not again.
# ... return
# From Russia with love
He was right, you know.
- What is it?
- I'll show you.
# ... faces
# And smile for a moment
# But, oh
# You haunted me so
# Still my tongue-tied
# Young pride would not let my love
# For you show
# In case you'd say no
# To Russia I flew
# But there and then
# I suddenly knew
# You'd care again
# My running around
# Is proof
# I'd fly to you
# From Russia
# With love

ENHOH
All ready here, sir. Crew standing by and awaiting your word. Over.
Right. Over and out.
Our man was brought down at 2 a. m. this morning.
SHAEF, in their all-knowing wisdom, didn't let us know until 10 a. m.
Damned idiots.
Damned idiots for not letting us know.
Double damned idiots for ignoring our advice in the first place.
Anyway, here he is...
...in a town called Werfen...
...at the Schloss Adler, the Castle of the Eagles.
And believe me, it's well-named, because only an eagle can get to it.
Our job is to get inside there and get him out as soon as possible...
...before they can get the information from him.
How are you so sure that he's there, sir?
The Mosquito he was in crash-landed only 10 miles away.
The Schloss Adler is the headquarters of the
German secret service in southern Bavaria.
Where else would they take him?
- How did the plane crash, sir?
- Through the most damnable ill luck.
We carried out a saturation raid on Nuremberg last night.
There shouldn't have been a German fighter within 100 miles of the Austrian border.
A wandering Messerschmitt patrol got him.
Anyway, that's not important.
What is important is that we get him out before he talks.
Or I should say, you get him out.
What about paratroops, sir?
The Schloss Adler is inaccessible and impregnable.
It would require a battalion of paratroops to take it.
We haven't got the time.
Stealth and secrecy are our only hope...
...and you gentlemen are,
I trust, stealthy and secretive.
We realize of course that you've never worked together before as a team...
...but you're familiar with one another, except for Lieutenant Schaffer here.
You probably noticed that Lieutenant Schaffer...
...wears the shoulder flashes of the American Ranger division.
I think that speaks for itself.
Major Smith will lead the group in.
Now, you're all expert at survival behind enemy lines.
Smith, Lieutenant Schaffer...
...Sergeants Harrod and MacPherson in their military capacities...
...the rest of you in other duties.
You all speak fluent German.
You've been trained in different types of combat.
If anybody has a chance of getting him out, you have.
There is, of course, another way, sir.
A way with a 100 percent guarantee of success.
Neither Admiral Rolland or I claim to be omniscient or infallible.
Is there an alternative that we've missed?
Whistle up a pathfinder squadron of Lancasters with 10-ton bombs.
I don't think anybody in that castle would ever talk again.
Nor do I think that you grasp the realities of the situation.
The captured man, General Carnaby, is an American.
If we were to destroy him, then I think General Eisenhower...
...might launch his second front against us rather than against the Germans.
There are certain niceties to be observed in our relationship with our allies.
Very well, then, gentlemen.
Ten o'clock tonight at the airfield.
- No more questions, I take it?
- Yes, sir.
Begging the colonel's pardon, sir.
What's all this about?
I mean, why is this man so damned important?
- Why should...?
- That'll do, sergeant.
You have all the information you require.
I think if we're sending a man to what may be his death...
...he has a right to know why.
It's painfully simple, sergeant.
General Carnaby is one of the overall coordinators...
...of planning for the second front.
He set out last night to meet his opposite numbers in the Middle East...
...to finalize the plans for the invasion of Europe.
The rendezvous with the Russians was to have been in Crete.
Now, unfortunately, his plane didn't get through.
Now, if the Germans can make him talk...
...it could mean no second front this year.
- Do you understand, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry, sir.
That's all right, sergeant. Forget it.
Now, if you have any more questions,
Major Smith will answer them.
That's all, gentlemen.
Get them ready.
We're approaching the drop area.
Stand by!
Green on! Go!
Where's Harrod?
Well, last time I saw him, he was drifting towards those trees over here.
All right. Spread out.
Let's go and find him.
Major!
- His neck's broken.
- Damn it.
Well, what do we do now?
Do we bury him or do we leave him here?
We leave him here. The snow will cover him in a couple of hours.
Get back and pick up the equipment.
I want to see if the radio's still working.
Well...
...the radio works all right. There's a barn about a mile down the valley.
We'll use it to check our equipment.
- What about the people who live in it?
- There aren't any.
This is a high alpine pasture.
They bring the cattle up in May and take them down in September.
The rest of the time, the place is totally deserted.
Come on. Let's go.
Somehow, you know, this just isn't me.
It's not any of us, Jock.
You're the cook. Cook...
...some hot food and some hot coffee, and then call London on the radio.
Damn it. I left that codebook in Sergeant Harrod's tunic.
- I'll go and get it for you.
- No, it's all right. It's my own stupid fault.
Sounds as if it's still blowing a blizzard.
Yeah.
Well, if I'm not back in an hour...
...signal me with a flare pistol four times every five minutes.
That should bring a blind man home.
Might also bring the best part of a German regiment.
There's not a German within five miles.
Nobody leaves here until I come back.
- Jock, save me some coffee.
- It'll be cold by then.
They say that's an advantage.
You can't taste cold coffee.
Halt.
Turn around.
You took your time getting here, didn't you?
Things to attend to.
- You enjoy your trip?
- Lovely.
I nearly froze to death in that damn plane.
Why couldn't you have supplied some hot water bottles or an electrically heated suit?
- I thought you loved me.
- I can't help what you think.
You managed to bring your gear.
Is that all the greeting I'm going to get?
I'm afraid so, for the time being.
My radio operator was killed in the drop.
What happened?
Something struck him in the back of the neck.
Either the haft of a knife or the butt of a gun.
The skin was unbroken, but badly discolored.
It means someone broke his neck afterwards...
...to make it look like an accident.
Now listen, I'm taking the group at dawn over the ridge into the next valley.
We'll stop in the woods until about 7.
Now, don't stumble into us.
As soon as it's dark, we'll move into the village of Werfen.
In the village, there's a gasthaus called Zum Wilden Hirsch.
Behind it and to the right, there's a woodshed.
I'll meet you there at exactly 8:00 tomorrow night.
- And after that, what?
- I'll let you know when the time comes.
Ah.
- I see you've come fully prepared.
- Never mind about that.
How do you know about all these things,
Zum Wilden Hirsch and the shed?
I'm entitled to know.
You're entitled to know nothing.
We've worked together for three years.
I'm a professional.
So am I.
If I were the marrying kind, which I'm...
- I thought you were in a hurry.
- So I am.
Aren't you?
What kept you?
Well, I was very lucky.
I ran into this fabulous blond.
She was lying on a snowdrift.
Does she have a friend?
No, I'm afraid you're out of luck.
- Thanks for waiting up for me, anyway.
- No problem.
Lieutenant, why don't you go to sleep?
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours.
You too, Jock.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Can't get a thing.
Probably the storm, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, we'll try again in the morning.
Lieutenant, come with me.
The rest of you stay here.
Better leave the equipment here.
Somebody's got to be crazy.
How'd your colonel expect anyone to get in there?
He feels if he can penetrate the German High Command...
...we shouldn't have difficulty getting up.
He did what?
He spent the years '40 to '43 in Germany, first in the Wehrmacht...
...and then finally in General Headquarters in Berlin.
They say he knew Hitler quite well.
- I thought he looked a little nuts.
- Yeah, probably is.
Now we've got problems of our own.
Get the boys into the trees.
We've brought them too far over.
Be sure they go beyond that tree line.
- And what about you?
- I'll be along in a minute.
- Be sure they stay behind the trees.
- All right.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.
Danny Boy calling
Broadsword. Father Machree is waiting.
This is Father Machree, Broadsword.
What is your present position, please?
Over.
Woods due west of castle.
Descending at dusk. Harrod dead.
Over.
Was Harrod killed accidentally? Over.
No. Over.
By the Germans? Over.
No.
Time of next broadcast uncertain.
Will you stand by?
Over.
Colonel Turner and I will remain at headquarters till operation completed.
Good luck. Out.
It looks as though you're right, sir.
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Who's next, I wonder?
Smith himself, perhaps.
I doubt that.
Some people have a sixth sense.
He has a sixth, a seventh and an eighth.
- He's our best agent.
- Except yourself.
Still and all, even if he is the best, this whole operation looks impossible now.
Take a look down there, at the foot of the castle.
Dobermans.
Yeah. Dobermans, a guard tower and a wire fence.
Fences can be cut or climbed, lieutenant.
I doubt if that one can be climbed. It's got around 3,000 volts running through it.
If I'm not mistaken, major, that's an army barracks over there.
No mistake. This is the headquarters of the Wehrmacht Alpenkorps.
Swell. If you got any other surprises,
I think I ought to know about them.
I thought you knew, lieutenant.
Why do you think we're not dressed as German sailors?
Training troops come and go all the time.
What are six new faces among 600 new faces?
Look, major, this is primarily a British operation.
I'm an American.
I don't even know why the hell I'm here.
Lieutenant, you're here because you're an American.
Dear Kramer, you have turned a little gray since I saw you last.
I'm afraid so, sir.
- How is Berlin, sir?
- Things have changed.
You like my machine?
- It looks pretty dangerous.
- Well, you must try it.
Major Burkhalter, my adjutant.
Major Brant, Jaeger Battalion.
Colonel Weissner, Field Security.
Major Von Hapen, Gestapo.
- Have you questioned him yet?
- No. I was waiting for you.
That Major Von Hapen, does he know General Carnaby's here?
Yes. I did inform him of his arrival, but not of his importance.
Good. If possible, I'd prefer the Gestapo to be kept out of this matter...
...until we have the information we want.
- Fine.
We don't need them cluttering up things with torture chambers.
This can remain a strictly army matter for the time being.
- I agree.
- Good.
I've had a very tiring trip down here from Berlin. I'd like to freshen up a bit.
Perhaps sleep a few hours before meeting General Carnaby.
I'll see you to your quarters.
Thank you.
The meeting will be ready whenever you wish.
Tell me...
Show me your papers.
Right.
I've written her many times of course, but...
...with so many troops on leave in Berlin, it was hardly likely she'd remember me.
But one always hopes you're the one she'll never forget.
Yeah. What was her name, anyway?
- Fred.
- Fred?
Oh, yeah, I remember Fred, yeah.
She was a short little redhead.
We'll try this one behind us.
When you get inside, circulate around.
Keep your ears open for anything about General Carnaby.
We meet back here in half an hour. All right.
Two beers.
Ah.
See you later.
Anything else needed here? Oh.
And who might you be, my pretty alpine rose?
- Heidi. Stop, major. I've got work.
- There's no more important work...
...than entertaining the soldiers of the fatherland.
- Shall I sing you a song?
- I hear too much singing.
Oh, very well, then. I'll whistle.
It goes like this:
I bet you have a beautiful singing voice too.
Thank you.
Be in the woodshed in five minutes.
Now slap me across the face as hard as you can.
Oh!
Major...
...your conduct does not become an officer of the Wehrmacht.
Herr Major, when you talk to me.
Major Bernd Himmler.
Does the name mean anything to you?
I advise you to mind your own business in future.
Is that understood?
- Cognac.
- Make that two.
I don't suppose you found out anything about General Carnaby.
I didn't get around to that. Thank you.
What were you and that major talking about?
I told him I was Himmler's brother.
Yeah, I could see why that would shake him up a little.
More than a little, I should think.
Keep an eye on things. I'll be back.
Take your clothes off.
- But I...
- Don't argue. Take your clothes off.
All right.
Now, relax. I didn't mean it that way.
You are going up to the castle tonight as...
Well, yes, as a domestic.
How? Naked?
Not a bad idea, but it's a bit obvious.
There's an acute staff shortage in Germany and the Schloss Adler is no exception.
You're the type they're looking for: young, intelligent, good-looking...
...and as we both know, not entirely without humor.
You must be mad.
If I wasn't, what would I be doing in this job?
Now listen very carefully.
You're supposed to arrive on a bus from Steingaden in about 20 minutes.
Your name is Maria Schenk.
You come from the Rhineland.
Here, give me that boot.
You've had TB and were forced to give up your job.
You have a cousin called Heidi who works in Zum Wilden Hirsch.
It's because of her that you got the job.
- Where are my identity papers?
- In that case...
...together with your travel permit.
Heidi will give you the rest later.
It must have taken time to prepare these things.
Very likely. Our Forgery Department did a special job on your papers.
But I thought General Carnaby's plane crashed only yesterday morning.
It was carefully arranged.
The plane was crash-landed in Oberhausen Military Airfield...
...about five miles from here.
It was riddled with machine-gun holes,
British machine-gun holes.
But what the hell?
A hole is a hole is a hole, as they say.
Are you trying to say that you'd risk the life of an American general...
...and all the plans for the second front?
- Of course not.
Give me the other boot.
I'm in a hurry to get to the castle...
...before they find out they haven't got General Carnaby.
The chap they've got knows no more about the second front...
...than I know about the back end of the moon. He's an American corporal.
His name is Cartwright Jones.
He's an ex-actor, probably second-rate...
...but he's the dead spitting image of the general.
Did you talk this poor man into getting involved with all this?
I didn't have to. He volunteered.
What actor wouldn't?
If he pulls this off, it'll be the summit of his professional career.
Mind you, it might be a short engagement.
Yes. A one-night stand.
Ah.
Well, here we are.
Mary, now Maria, this is your cousin Heidi.
Leave this behind in case you're searched.
Heidi will tell you what to do from now on.
She's been one of our top agents in Bavaria since 1941 and...
What a disguise.
So he left three minutes after me...
...in a hurry, you say, so he wasn't after me.
Any of the others leave?
Not that I could see, but this place is so crowded...
...and there are several other exits.
Any one of them could have slipped out.
You better start playing it straight or you can deal me out of this mess.
Now, we both know that radio operator wasn't killed in any drop.
Now, with MacPherson dead, there's only five of us left.
You either let me know what's going on or there's only gonna be four.
All right, lieutenant.
This morning you asked me why you, an American, was on this mission.
Well, the answer is really very simple.
Maria.
Oh, my dear Maria, you came after all.
My dear cousin Heidi, how wonderful to see you after all these years.
Gestapo. I am so happy to see you.
May I introduce you to a friend of mine?
Major Von Hapen.
My cousin Maria Schenk.
Your cousin told us to expect you,
Fräulein Schenk, but Heidi...
...you did not tell me she was as beautiful as this.
Thank you.
Perhaps when you're ready to take the cable car to the castle...
...I'll have the honor to escort you.
Thank you.
And I am going with her.
Oh.
Both of you, huh?
Well, then I am very fortunate.
Fräulein, until a little bit later.
This is a map of the castle.
And your instructions.
Do your homework well.
He doesn't seem to be anywhere in here.
Wonder where the devil he's got to.
I gave orders that nobody should leave.
Shall I go outside and take a look?
Attention. Nobody make a move.
Against the wall, please.
Against the wall.
Attention.
We are looking for four or five
Alpenkorps deserters from Stuttgart.
To escape, they killed two officers and a guardroom sergeant.
They were last known to be heading this way.
Clever. Very clever, indeed.
I want the senior officers of Drafts 13,
14 and 15 to come forward at once.
Check their papers.
Well, gentlemen, any suggestions?
Lieutenant?
Well, I think we'll stand a lot better chance outside than we will in here.
Agreed.
Gentlemen, see you after the war.
These papers are from the Fourth Panzer
Division stationed in Stuttgart.
When were they issued to him?
- Colonel.
- What is it, major?
Myself and the others are the ones you're looking for. We've come to surrender.
Lieutenant, take the three men away for questioning.
The officers will come with me.
Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Major Von Hapen.
Yes, sir.
Fräulein.
It's just my shoelaces.
- Need to get rid of this thing.
- Yeah.
Over the cliff. Let's push.
Okay. Push.
Push.
And a little more.
Good evening, lieutenant.
This is Miss Schenk. Lieutenant Kernitser.
She is the colonel's secretary in charge of all the female staff.
Can I see your papers, please?
And yours, Fräulein.
Would you come with me, please?
- Perhaps I'll see you a little later.
- Thank you.
Do you find anything interesting, major?
I hear there was some excitement in the village tonight.
Oh, nothing very serious.
Just the arrest of five army deserters, that's all.
Not quite. Those were the orders that were put out.
But actually, they were five British agents dressed in German uniforms.
British agents? Why wasn't I informed?
I'm informing you now, major.
If you sent out the orders, colonel...
...then you must have known for some time...
...who they were and that they were in this district.
We called you in your office and in your rooms.
You were not there.
Colonel, I don't have to remind you, do I...
...that I am in charge of all the Gestapo activities in this area...
...and if there are foreign agents, then I am to be informed at once!
- You were not here, major.
- Then you find me, colonel.
My duty is to inform you, but not to search every gasthaus to locate you.
I know your duties...
...and your loyalties.
Let me remind you, major, that I'm a colonel in the SS...
...and not some lieutenant you can frighten with your threats!
Your military rank and position are obvious to me, colonel...
...and so are your attempts to discredit me with my superiors in Berlin.
If there is any discredit, you bring it upon yourself.
Good night.
- You better lock the door.
- Sure.
Here are all the things you'll need.
Automatic, field glasses, ball of string and lead weight.
- You put those things in there?
- A week ago.
- You knew all about this even then?
- Yeah. Good luck, cousin.
We may need these.
I guess it's occurred to you, the Germans probably know about all this stuff by now.
It did cross my mind.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.
Broadsword, sir.
Danny Boy calling Broadsword.
Come in, Broadsword. Over.
MacPherson murdered. Thomas,
Christiansen and Berkeley captured.
I'm effecting entrance within the hour.
Please have transport standing by. Over.
Pull out now, Broadsword.
Save yourselves. Over.
You must be joking. Over and out.
That is an order, Broadsword. Over.
Broadsword? Broadsword?
Broadsword?
He's gone, sir.
Damn it!
It's all my fault.
It's all our fault, colonel.
It was my idea.
Maybe I'm getting too old.
Maybe we're both too old.
Well, anyway, there can't be any doubt anymore.
The Germans have totally penetrated Ml6.
They know every move we make almost before we make it.
Where the hell are they getting it all from?
We handpicked every man for this mission.
- We have top security.
- Security?
That word has become a bloody joke.
We've got company.
- Open the window.
- All right.
Put the bag in the bus and see if you can start the engine.
- How's it going?
- Try to give it a start.
Right.
Yes. Captain Mueller, with three prisoners.
All right.
Leave this one behind and tie that one to the end of the rope.
Good God, that nearly killed me.
You shouldn't go on these insane missions.
You're getting too old.
I thank you for those few kind words.
The first time I've been hot since I was in this bloody country.
- You got a plan of the castle?
- Yes.
Well, fetch it for me, would you?
Why don't you give him a hand?
What for? He's perfectly capable of looking after himself.
If I could climb up on my own, why can't he?
First left down the stairs, third door.
Next right-hander takes us into the east wing.
Down again. Second left.
Telephone exchange.
You wouldn't mind giving me a hand, would you?
You seem to have a lot of women stashed around this country, major.
I'm sorry. This is Mary.
She's one of our group.
- Lieutenant Schaffer.
- Hello.
Hello, Mary.
Thank you.
Take the rope and the explosives to your room...
...and bring them with you when you come.
- How's it looking?
- It's quiet enough.
First thing we gotta do is cripple that helicopter.
They might try to fly Carnaby out in it.
I think we can handle that.
Hello?
- You the pilot?
Yes, sir.
Kommandant wants you on the phone.
It's in the radio office on the left, around the corner.
- Do you have a cigarette, lieutenant?
- Yes, sir. Of course.
- Rather cold, isn't it?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Well, that was quick.
Fear lent them wings, as the saying goes.
What do we do now?
I think we'd better see how
Cartwright Jones is getting along.
You are making things very difficult, Herr General.
- Very, very difficult, indeed.
There aren't any difficulties, major.
General Rosemeyer here hasn't forgotten that Germany's a signatory...
...to the Hague Convention.
I have not forgotten, but my hands are tied.
I have my orders from Berlin.
You can tell Berlin all they're entitled to know.
I'm General George Carnaby,
United States Army, RA 123-025-3964.
And one of the chief coordinators of planning for the second front.
Which second front is that?
Well, general, I have done all I can.
I have tried to hold up the Gestapo.
I've persuaded the High Command that the mere fact of your capture...
...will compel the Allies to alter their plans...
...but this, it seems, is not enough.
For the last time, may I request you to give us the information?
General George Carnaby,
United States Army.
The matter is in your hands, Kramer.
You know, general, we have drugs that will make you talk.
- We do not wish to use them, but...
- Scopolamine. Heh, heh, heh.
Where's that gonna get you, colonel?
There are other drugs too.
The lieutenant here is a trained nurse.
Excuse me.
Yes?
And they are who we thought?
Very good.
Yes. Yes, you can bring them up now.
Has there been any further information about the other two?
Well, keep me advised.
Some very interesting company coming up, general.
The drugs may not be necessary.
Don't you think it's time we make a move?
Any minute now.
Just be patient.
A moment.
Fräulein.
Did I disturb you?
- No, I was just going out.
- Well, then I am just in time.
- You wanted to see me, major?
- Naturally.
What about?
Well, nothing.
I just wanted to see you.
Now, that is not a crime, is it?
No.
It's very seldom we have so pretty a girl here.
Perhaps I can show you a little Bavarian hospitality.
Now, downstairs, we have an armaments room...
...which has been converted into the most marvelous café.
But my duties,
I have to see the colonel's secretary.
The colonel's secretary can wait a little while.
You and me, we have a lot to talk about.
- Such as?
- Düsseldorf.
- Düsseldorf?
- I was a student there for many years.
From 1929 to 1933.
To your health, gentlemen.
You are not drinking, general.
That's understandable...
...when your rescuers turn out to be, well, birds of a different feather.
And the return trip, gentlemen.
How was that to be accomplished?
- Through Switzerland.
- Mm-hm.
Then it should be quite easy for you to return to London.
A rubber dinghy across the Rhine, and then a short walk.
You'll be in Whitehall...
...reporting General Carnaby's transfer to Berlin before you know it.
Back to London? Are you mad?
Not with Smith and Schaffer still alive.
What do you take us for?
You will also, of course, be reporting the unfortunate demise of Major Smith.
- Is he dead?
We are not quite sure.
- It is being looked into right now.
- It's getting late.
- Please remember the important issue.
- Yes, sir.
I think the situation has changed sufficiently...
...for you to give us the information we have been asking for.
Nothing's changed, colonel.
Most unfortunate.
Just a waste of good scopolamine.
Don't move, any of you.
Lieutenant.
No, I'd advise you not to, colonel.
Well, gentlemen, I'm glad to see you all here, safe and sound, enjoying a drink.
I'm sorry to interrupt you.
Lieutenant, drop that gun.
- What?
- Drop that gun and sit down.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Sit down!
- Major, if I live to be 100...
- Do nothing, lieutenant.
In your own idiom, you're a punk...
...and a pretty second-rate punk at that.
- If I might have some explanation...
- In good time, colonel. All in good time.
I was about to say scopolamine would have little effect on our friend...
...except to prove he's not General Carnaby, but a certain Cartwright Jones...
...an American actor impersonating General Carnaby.
- Who are you?
- Just a passer-by, as you might say.
In fact, I think the drug would probably work better...
...on our friends at the end of the table.
They're our real enemies.
- Don't listen to him, general. It's a bluff!
- Keep quiet!
Allow me to introduce myself.
Major Johann Schmidt.
SS Military Intelligence, Stuttgart.
- Can you prove that?
- Certainly, colonel.
Before I do, I wonder if you'd be good enough to call one of your guards.
I don't fancy talking and keeping my eye on these people at the same time.
Strange.
I seem to remember...
...that the cathedral was on the other side of the square.
Well...
Of course, I might be mistaken.
It's been a long time.
Oh, no, major.
I could have made a mistake.
I haven't been to Düsseldorf for three years.
It's very easy to forget.
Yes. It's very easy.
Fräulein, you seem to be a little bit distracted.
- Is anything wrong?
- No. No, it's nothing.
Just a slight headache.
I've had a long day traveling.
Oh, yes, of course. And here I am...
...I'm talking about silly things like Düsseldorf.
- You will forgive me?
- Of course.
Thank you. I tell you what.
We will have one more schnapps together and then I'll see you to your quarters.
- Thank you.
- Fräulein!
Well, now that we're all comfortable, the first order of business...
...is to find out exactly who everybody is and what they're doing here.
Now, first the lieutenant.
He's an assassin...
...a member of the American intelligence organization known as OSS.
His job was to shoot you, Colonel Kramer, and you, General Rosemeyer.
Now, General Carnaby's mission was twofold:
First, to allow himself to be tortured...
...into giving you the wrong plans for the second front.
And secondly, to afford the British...
...a perfect excuse to send in a team of experts to rescue him.
Which brings us to our three friends here...
...and the cleverest phase of the British operation.
- They are, of course, members of Ml6.
- That's a lie.
Let him finish!
Their job was to penetrate the German High Command...
...instead of the real
Thomas, Berkeley and Christiansen...
...who worked for us in London...
...and were discovered and captured by the British about a month ago.
That's another lie.
You can't prove any of this.
Can't I?
Any denials, lieutenant?
Now, General Carnaby, perhaps you'd be good enough...
...to give us your real name, rank and serial number.
Cartwright Jones, corporal, U.S. Army...
...RA 123-025-3964.
Thank you.
Having successfully substituted these three British agents for our men...
...what was the next phase of the British plan?
To penetrate the German High Command.
How? Simple.
Stage a fake air crash with a fake American general on board...
...send in special agents to effect his release...
...be sure that they fail in their mission...
...and these men would be taken to Berlin...
...where they would be right in the heart of the Wehrmacht.
And you, Major Schmidt, what were your orders on this mission?
To lead them in and make my own way out through Switzerland.
- But it... It's incredible.
- Yes.
But to the British, very, very simple.
You were going to give us some proof of who you are.
Certainly, general.
The proof is in three parts.
First, if I'm not who I say I am...
...what am I doing here?
What can I possibly hope to gain?
The rescue of an impostor, the exposure of three spies. Who to?
To the very people they're supposed to be working for.
I have nothing to gain.
Also, if these people are what they say they are...
...they would know the name of our top agent in Whitehall.
- Yes.
- So why don't we ask them?
They should know the man who sent them on this mission.
We all work through contacts.
It wasn't necessary or safe for us to know...
...where our orders were coming from.
Then I should be in the same boat as you, but I know his name and you don't.
Secondly, colonel, you have...
...one of the most powerful radio transmitters in Europe.
Put a radio telephone call through...
...to Field Marshal Kesselring's headquarters in Italy...
...and ask for his Chief of Intelligence, a Major Wilhelm Wilner.
Major. Major.
Major.
There's Colonel Kramer on the telephone from the Schloss Adler in Bavaria.
He says it's very urgent.
Major Wilner speaking.
Ja, colonel.
- Can you describe him?
- That will not be necessary.
Ask him to show you his right forearm.
- May I see your right forearm?
- Certainly.
There are two parallel scars, about three centimeters apart.
The scars are there.
Ask how did he get them.
- How did you get those?
- I was born with them.
He says he was born with them.
That is right. Then tell him he's a traitor.
Tell him he's a renegade.
That is Schmidt. No question about it.
- Thank you, major.
- Thank you, colonel.
Good night.
Give me the water.
As you know, the real Thomas,
Christiansen and Berkeley...
...while working for British counterespionage...
...were responsible for setting up an excellent chain of agents throughout Britain.
Now, if these men are who they claim to be...
...it would be reasonable...
...to expect them to be able to write down a list of those agents.
You could then compare their lists with the genuine one...
...which I have in this book.
- There's something very wrong, colonel.
I don't doubt who Schmidt is, but there has been some mistake.
Yes, and you're the ones who have made it.
Fräulein, would you be good enough to get some pencils and some notebooks...
...and we'll soon find out who's speaking the truth.
Good night, Maria.
You are a most charming girl.
Good night and thank you.
We must get to know each other a little better.
- Yes.
- Good night.
Good night.
Any one of these will do.
Now compare it with my original.
Guard!
Stay as you were, gentlemen.
Just relax.
Second-rate punk, huh?
All I could think of on the spur of the moment.
- Thanks. That even makes it worse.
- Sorry.
Well, between them, they shouldn't have missed anything.
This is all you want. Those books?
- Lots of nice names and addresses.
And these men?
Then they are who they claim to be?
I'm afraid so. They've been under suspicion for some time.
Classified information was going out and useless information was coming in.
It took several weeks to pin it on the departments controlled by those men.
But we knew we couldn't prove it.
Even if we could...
...what we really wanted was the names of their contacts.
These names and addresses.
So we thought this plan up.
And Wilner,
Kesselring's Chief of Intelligence?
He truly believes me to be one of his top agents in Italy.
I've been feeding him useless, false and out-of-date information for a couple years.
- All right, gentlemen...
Stay where you are!
I'd advise everyone to keep perfectly still.
Drop your gun, major.
You too, lieutenant.
By the fireplace.
Thank God you're here.
We were just about...
Sit down, colonel!
Everybody remain as he is...
...until I find out what exactly is going on here.
What do you mean?
Surely, you can see what's...
Sit down, colonel.
It's perfectly simple.
The lieutenant and myself...
...have uncovered a plot to assassinate the Führer.
- This is preposterous!
- General!
Sit down.
These people were all involved in a conspiracy to overthrow the Third Reich.
In my pocket here,
I have the names of all the conspirators.
Just before you interrupted us, we put this entire party under arrest.
The list in his pocket are the names of German agents working in Britain!
I don't expect you to believe me, major.
But you'll certainly believe these names if you'll permit me to show them to you.
Let me see them.
Careful, major.
Go very slowly.
Bring them here.
Smith.
All of you, get up! Stand over there.
Put your hands up.
Put your hands up!
Jones, see if you can find something to tie them up with.
Mary, bring that bag over here.
- What do we do with these three?
- We take them with us.
You were late.
- One day I won't come at all.
- Keep your eye on those three.
Lieutenant, in the next 15 minutes...
...we have to create enough confusion to get out of here alive.
Major, right now you got me about as confused as I ever hope to be.
The armory's here.
If we blow it up, the castle will think...
...it's being attacked by a division.
On the other side of the castle over here is the radio room.
I'll take the others and meet you there.
You take the map.
Mary, we're going.
Let me make myself perfectly understood.
If any of you utters a word, I'll kill you all.
You understand?
- Jones, get the major's gun. Now move.
- Yes, sir.
Move!
Go!
This way.
Jones.
Wait. Go back. Jones, go on.
Mary, get in. Get in there.
At ease.
Hello.
Get them in.
All right, inside, quickly.
You may need this.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
- We got company.
- Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.
Get the rest of the men out of here and report to the Kommandant.
Danny Boy calling Broadsword. Over.
Everything ready.
We need transport. Understood?
- Over.
- Understood.
Do you have it? Over.
We have it. We have it all. Over.
All sins forgiven.
Damn it.
Get Thomas out of there. Quickly.
Now!
Get out. Climb out.
Get on with it!
Grenades.
Corporal!
Outside! Out! Out!
All right.
Lieutenant, get the rope.
Back. Get back.
All right, to the right.
Quick. Move it.
Damn! Blast it!
Get moving.
All right. Get those men untied.
Better put those coats on if you don't want to freeze to death. Quickly, now.
Christiansen.
Jones, get them out. Mary.
Watch them. Right.
- The doors to the corridor are locked.
- See what winch controls they have.
- There's a stop and start button.
- See if you can make the motor work.
Not bad, huh?
- Yes, good.
Now bring it down here and we'll get on top, and you can take us back inside.
- Mary, bring them out here!
- Go on.
Get ahold of the rope and climb down.
Climb down!
Look out!
Schaffer?
Schaffer? Schaffer?
We've got him, Smith! Now, listen, Smith.
I'll make a deal with you.
You let us go down in the car and we won't kill Schaffer.
Smith!
You bring him out so I can see he's still alive.
I'm bringing him out now.
Get in the car.
Give me that.
Damn it!
Up there. Get him!
Help me. No.
No. No!
Help me.
Please.
No!
Lieutenant.
- Where's the major?
- He's on the cable car.
Jones, the bag.
Let's go.
Set the bombs to go off in three and a half minutes.
- Almost ready?
- Almost.
Jones. Mary.
All set.
Go.
- Twenty-five minutes. Can we make it?
- We can make it.
- Point is, will they?
- God knows.
Everybody on the floor.
Emergency. Get me the Oberhausen Airfield immediately.
- We've got company.
- Yeah, I saw them in the mirror.
How long before we reach the poles?
Just around the next turn.
Oberhausen Airfield?
Give me the Kommandant's office.
Get ready.
Set the rest of them and get out of here.
Oberhausen control tower.
Oberhausen control tower.
Oberhausen control. Over.
I'm in serious trouble.
Request urgent permission to land. Over.
Identify. Over.
Leutnant Ulrich.
Third Jaeger Junker squadron on night navigational exercise.
One engine out. Losing altitude. Over.
You are cleared for immediate landing. Over.
Coming in. Over.
Fighter Wing 126,
Oberhausen Airfield calling. Over.
Fighter Wing 126, Ober...
Get the control tower.
Come in... Aah!
Get down.
- Berkeley wrote these names?
- Yes, sir.
Ted Berkeley. I can't believe it.
And Thomas. And Christiansen.
All three of them?
- My God, it's incredible.
- Yes, quite.
But not as incredible as the one name that's missing from that list, colonel.
What name is that, major?
I have it in this notebook here in my pocket.
Earlier tonight, I showed it to Colonel Kramer.
He agreed with me that this was the top German agent in Britain.
It's your name, colonel.
Don't look so shocked.
Surely, you suspected it.
Otherwise, why were you here to meet us?
In case you were found out?
Go on.
You see, you underestimated
Admiral Rolland.
He'd suspected you and the others for some time.
He brought me and Mary back from Italy because we were the only two...
...in his department that he could trust, yourself included.
He asked you to choose a leader for this expedition.
You chose me because you knew from German intelligence...
...that I was a double agent.
Admiral Rolland knew I was not.
But for you, I was the perfect choice.
- Now you're guessing, Smith.
- No guesswork, colonel.
Your pointing that gun at me is sufficient evidence.
You are pointing it at me, aren't you?
Go on.
Mary was brought on the mission without your knowledge because I needed her...
...to get me into the castle.
The lieutenant, being an American...
...had no possible connection with Ml6...
...and was the only member of the group
I could trust.
I wasn't even sure of
Harrod and MacPherson...
...until they were killed by the others.
Fascinating. Very fascinating.
Perhaps even true.
- Assuming for a moment...
- You're finished, colonel.
- You're overlooking something, aren't you?
- Not at all.
Admiral Rolland took you to the plane himself, didn't he?
He also made certain that you had that gun, didn't he?
We took the precaution of removing the firing pin before the mission started.
Put it down, colonel.
Not so hasty, lieutenant.
We mustn't cheat the hangman.
What now, major?
You'll be tried for treason.
A public trial would be embarrassing.
Painful, not only for myself...
...but also for British Intelligence and Admiral Rolland.
Perhaps, but not as painful as that long drop to the end of the rope.
Well...
...I seem to have no cards left to play, do I?
No, colonel, you don't.
- Do I have an alternative?
- If you want it.
Mm.
Thank you.
I'll have those books.
Well, is that it, major?
Yes, that's it, lieutenant.
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time you have one of these things, keep it an all-British operation.
I'll try, lieutenant.
I've lived all my life on the sea.
So did my father.
So will my son.
I've seen the giant creatures of the deep, the great whales, making their passage to northern feeding grounds.
And the last herds of the sea elephant.
I've watched the cunning maneuvers of killer whale..
As they leaped into the air...
And hit the sea with the sound of a Cannon shot, frightening the sea elephants and sea lions into the water, where they would become easy prey.
The shark, lacking this cleverness, prowled for what smaller fish he could find.
The giant octopus, fearsome-looking but timid, has many a time avoided my boat.
But the dolphins, the dolphins always seemed to come right up to the Fisherman's boat and ride the bow wave with the speed of a torpedo.
Curiously, they seemed at times to be talking to each other and to be looking at us.
I used to watch them for hours, studying them, thinking and remembering the stories
I'd heard about them.
But I didn't really know the dolphins until my son, a child, as in the Bible, led me to an understanding of their kind.
It was a few years ago when the red plague destroyed almost all edible fish in the Florida keys.
Like the fishermen above, the surviving creatures below were hungry.
Even the swift dolphin was able to find no food.
The fish were poisoned by the plague.
Their lifeless bodies were spread throughout the sea.
Pa, maybe this time the fish will be alive.
Maybe the red tide didn't come out this far.
Maybe. But soon we're gonna find fish if we have to go 20 miles out and clear to the bottom.
They're dead.
Well, let's get rid of them.
It used to be you'd throw out an anchor, you'd hit a fish.
Pa, look!
Dolphins.
They're sure making time.
They're probably looking for fish the same as we are.
It shouldn't be as hard for them.
What's the matter, pa?
Is something wrong, pa?
Hazel must have changed her course.
The weather station this morning said she was headed west, but she's coming north now.
Amplifier's gone.
I should have carried a spare tube.
You're not scared, are you?
No, pa.
Well, lash down everything loose.
We'll gonna make a run for home.
Message block, son.
Good boy.
Read it.
"Return to port.
"Coast guard patrol boat will intercept you.
"Hurricane Hazel now heading north.
Winds increasing up to 80 knots."
But you knew that already.
I should have known it an hour ago. Hold fast.
You Porter Ricks out of coral key?
That's right.
We've been trying to raise you.
Radio's out.
You heard from Nick Velakis, another boat like mine?
Just had him on the radio.
He says he can make it in all right ahead of the storm.
I can't take you in tow.
Do you want to come aboard?
Risk my boat?
No, thank you.
We'll make it.
Pa, are we gonna make it?
I promised your ma we'd be home before dark.
Come on, Zack, hurry up.
It's terrible outside the channel.
I haven't seen your folks go by yet.
You better go and get 'em.
Mr. L.C. Porett, you old fool, stop nagging that boat and get get on up there to the post office.
And leave mirabel?
I'd rather leave my wife!
There's Porter.
Porter Ricks' boat.
Come on, Porter!
Come on, mirabel!
Porter, where the halifax you been?
Nick Velakis come in yet?
Ain't seen him.
Come on!
Everybody's heading for the post office.
Sandy, if your mother's not already at the post office, you get home and help her, you hear?
Ok, pa.
Give me that line.
Where the blazes you goin' now?
I'm gonna put that boat up at Willow creek.
She'll be safe there.
But you ain't got time.
Give me that line!
This boat's my living!
Kim.
Gee, I'm sorry.
Where you been?
The whole town's been worried about you and your father.
Is my mother inside the post office?
No. I was just going to see if... you go back inside.
I'll get her.
Gee, you're lucky.
A hurricane on your first visit.
Son!
Ma!
Where's your pa?
He's taking the boat up Willow creek.
Ma, what about Pete?
Can I take him?
Everyone's allowed one luxury.
Go get him.
Pete!
Pete, where are you?
Pete!
Pete!
Pete, come down here.
We got to get to the post office.
Pete, I'll whale the tar out of you unless you come down here!
Pete, come down here.
We got to get to the post office.
Is your ma all right?
Ma's ready to go.
Get Pete and come.
Come on down here, Pete.
Porter.
You didn't worry?
I did.
Will it be here when we get back?
The boat's safe.
I can always build another house.
Dang blast it, you stubborn old bird!
Come on, Sandy.
Pete won't come.
We can't wait.
He'll be killed.
Pelicans have lived through more hurricanes than we'll ever see.
Come on.
May I bring my boat in, miss hettie?
No, sir,
Mr. L.C. Porett.
You can come in, but you can't bring the boat.
I can't leave mirabel out here.
She'll blow away.
"Parcels in any post office of the United States
"shall not exceed
100 inches in length and girth combined."
Section 135.32, postal laws and regulations.
I don't want to mail mirabel anywhere.
The same applies to holding and storage.
Are you coming in?
Not without my mirabel
I ain't.
I'm pretty sure we got ahold of everybody that didn't go inland, except Nick Velakis.
His boat's still out.
Well, if the phone goes out, we've still got the radio.
Well, we're fairly comfortable here.
If the water level don't rise,
I think we'll make it all right.
Nick must have run with the wind, put in at one of the other keys.
He would have called me.
The phone lines might be down.
When he's safe,
I feel it.
Stella, he has to be all right.
Nobody knows the sea like Nick.
The sea...
It kills even those who know it.
I'm not worried about myself.
I just hope my father and cousin aren't trying to come out from the mainland.
State police don't let anybody on the causeway once the hurricane warning goes up.
Well, I bet he's sure worried about me.
What? With you staying with hettie?
You know what she says.
Uh-uh.
No hurricane would dare blow down the U.S. post office.
Miss hettie?
Miss hettie?
Miss hettie?
It's still no,
Mr. L.C. Porett.
Don't make no difference, miss hettie.
Mirabel just blew away.
Oh, Mr. Porett, come in.
Oh, Mr. L.C. Porett, you poor, dear man!
Post office.
Who's calling?
Who? Parker?
Oh. He wants you.
Miss hettie white speaking.
Yes, Mr. Parker.
I'm looking at her this very moment, safe, high and dry.
Aren't you, Kim?
Now, don't you worry,
Mr. Parker.
As soon as Hazel leaves, you come right on out.
Of course, we'll take good care... hello. Hello?
Hello!
Well, line's down.
That means the water's over the causeway.
Yeah. We could have water in here like in '58.
Radio: Winds to 120, gusts to 160.
Barometer is still falling.
Waterspouts reported in the area.
Full Gale warnings have been posted.
Pa, what about Pete?
It's my fish house!
It's on fire!
My fish house is on fire!
Mr. Abrams!
If it's not there, what do we do?
Build it again.
That's right, son.
Let's find out.
It's still there!
Pete?
Pete?
Isn't it beautiful?
You sure are.
Thanks for not crying.
Pa, we should've taken him with us.
Pa, we should've.
You haven't even looked for him.
Maybe he's under the house.
Let's go see.
Ohh!
Well, let's take a look.
Old hurricane Pete.
You get him untangled, son, he'll be all right.
Maybe we'd better look inside.
Pete, you old...
You gave me all that trouble last night you're going to, you old...
Sandy, your house is ok!
I thought I'd come and see.
Yeah, but this bird isn't.
Hey, it's Pete!
Yeah. And just as big a pest as ever.
Hi, Mr. Ricks.
Hi, Kim.
Well, it's kind of damp inside, but it's not too bad.
You going to see the boat?
Right now. Do you want to come along?
Yeah.
Sure!
Come on.
Pa, she's wrecked.
No, not wrecked, just swamped, but there might be some damage.
Here, son.
You bail out the dinghy while I take a look here.
A shark!
Where?
Over there!
It's a dolphin.
You hurt or scared?
Just scared,
I guess.
Good. You better start bailing.
Mr. L.C. Porett's gonna have to help me get the boat out.
Drive shaft's broken.
Lay to, northern star.
Lay to, baby.
Anytime your Jack is ready, Mr. L.C. Porett!
Aye, aye, Porter.
1/3 ahead, northern star.
1/3 ahead.
Easy as you go.
Gee, it's so pretty up here.
Look!
There he is again!
Pa?
Ever see anything like that before?
Dolphins do like that every now and then.
Little right rudder, northern star.
Do they really,
Mr. Ricks?
Well, there are lots of stories about dolphins.
One old one that Nick Velakis... that Nick tells about a Greek poet named arion, who lived some 3,000 years ago.
Once when he was sailing home to Greece from sicily, robbers took his money and threw him overboard.
Well, a dolphin who was following the ship swam for him, lifted him up, and carried him safely to shore.
You believe that, pa?
Well, I believe dolphins are very special animals.
Animals?
Sure. A dolphin isn't a fish.
They breathe air and have eyelids and have babies, just like people.
You mean the dolphin jumped right out of the dinghy?
Like a bucking bronco.
And like a dope,
I was yelling,
"shark! Shark!"
Oh, hello, sid.
Would you like a cup of... what is it?
Porter, I thought you ought to know.
He was your friend.
Nick Velakis.
We found his boat, but not his body, and we searched all day.
"He is not dead.
"He doth not sleep.
"He hath awakened from the dream of life.
He has outsoared the shadow of our night."
Unto almighty god, we commend the soul of Nick Velakis, who might not have been of our faith, but was in spirit a brother to us all.
We commit his body to the deep.
Amen.
Nick Velakis was killed by the sea, but he wasn't defeated by it.
His life and his living came from it.
When the red tide came and took the fish away, he kept looking for new places to find them, as food for all of us.
Nick, I'll keep searching.
In there, young man.
Put it in there.
Oh, Porter, knew I'd catch you on the way back.
Sorry I couldn't attend, but the living come first.
Lou germain sent you a wire from Ocala.
He...well, read it yourself.
It's really to you.
Thanks, hettie.
Come, now, a little bigger!
I wonder what's on Lou's mind.
Sandy!
My father's on his way with my cousin.
Is he bringing his new boat?
Uh-huh. We'll all go fishing.
Sandy: Ok.
Sandy, you've got a lot of chores and repair work at home.
Yes, sir.
See you later.
Fishing.
It's nice of Lou germain to offer to help.
Truth is,
I was going to ask him.
It's going to take a good
$300 worth of credit... a new drive shaft, engine parts, some new planking.
Po, have you thought again about doing what Lou did?
Go onto the mainland,
I mean.
Open a boat agency or some inland job we talked about?
At least there'd be no red plague or hurricanes.
Well, there might be other things.
I guess.
Well, if you're gonna truck the boat into Ocala tomorrow, let's go to bed.
Would you...Want to live on the mainland?
I just don't know anymore.
Leave those till morning, sweetheart.
Oh. I don't want to forget this.
Do you expect him to get all those chores done before you get back?
Well, he ought to.
I'll be gone at least a couple of weeks.
Dang you, Pete.
Don't you think this is heavy enough?
Beat it.
Mom?
Mom, could
I please... oh, thanks, ma.
Tired?
Dragging tired.
I think you've done enough for one day.
It's Kim and her father.
They've come for me.
Ma, can I go?
Of course.
Hi, Sandy!
Hi, Kim.
Dad, this is
Sandy Ricks.
Coming with us?
Oh, yes, sir.
With the red plague and the hurricanes, is there any fish out there?
Oh, yes, sir, if you know the spots.
Well, you're the pilot.
Cast off the lines.
The plague hasn't left very many fish, but sometimes there's one or two.
Sandy, you remember,
I told you my cousin was coming with dad?
Bill Jamison,
Sandy Ricks.
Aah!
Come on, Sandy.
Be careful.
Hey, let's go find Bill.
He's hurt.
What was it?
A dolphin.
Go get your pa.
Over there a little bit.
Sandy!
Doc barnett will know what to do.
He's taken care of just about everybody.
It's a slight concussion, but he's going to be all right.
Sandy, I can't thank you enough.
If Bill's ok, could we go back to Silver Cove now?
Silver cove?
What for?
That dolphin, sir.
It has a spear in its side.
What could we do for it?
My pa taught me to put a dog or a cat or any animal out of its pain, especially a dolphin, because they beach themselves before they die, and...
But, Sandy, I've got to call Bill's mother and tell her what happened.
She may want me to take bill in to to see the family doctor. I can't... it won't take long, dad!
Please, sir?
Dad...
Kim, it's not that
I don't want to.
But bill's mother would never forgive me.
Please...
Sandy!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
Hey, go ahead.
You're free.
I cut you loose.
Swim!
Are you hurt that bad?
Please move.
Just a flipper or something?
I can't leave you here to die.
Can't you move at all?
Sandy?
Hi.
Where'd you go?
Nowhere.
What'd you do?
Nothing.
Supper will be ready in a minute.
Didn't you go out with Kim and her father?
Oh, sure, mom.
Well, that's nice.
Mom?
Yes?
Mom...
Sandy, you been up to something?
Oh, no, ma, only...
Sandy, what?
I've got an 8-foot dying dolphin in the fish pen.
An 8-foot dolphin?
You know how long that cabinet is?
About 8 feet.
Now, you go wash up for supper.
Sandy.
I think I'll have a look.
Sandy!
That's what
I told you, ma.
He got speared.
Oh, that poor thing.
What'll we do, ma?
Same thing I'd do for any animal.
Get me the kitchen knife and the iodine.
And then?
Then I just towed him home.
"Where'd you go?
What'd you do?"
Nowhere, nothing, huh?
I think it'll be supper and a good night's rest for you.
Sandy!
That water's freezing!
You want to catch your death of cold?
Back to bed.
Yes, ma'am.
I just wanted to see how flipper was doing.
Flipper?
Yes, flipper.
I named him flipper.
Don't you think that's a good name, ma?
I think you should go back to bed. Go on, now.
Ok.
Poor flipper.
My cousin says he's awful sorry.
Daddy took him home this morning.
Ma, is he gonna die?
It's a very bad wound.
But you fixed it.
He needs strength to recover.
He needs food.
In the ocean, he'd have a chance... in the ocean?
Ma, the first shark that saw him would kill him.
He's so weak!
He'll die here, too, without food.
Couldn't we...
Somehow...
Can't I...
Your pa told you how much fish a dolphin eats.
About 15 pounds a day.
With the red plague, where would you find it?
Some days up at silver cove, there's a lot.
Not every day.
But he'll be well in a few days, and... and then we could...
Please, ma?
Please?
Well, you try it, but just today.
Come on, Kim!
Sandy, don't go down anymore.
You'll make yourself sick.
But only
2 little fish?
Please?
There just aren't any more.
I guess you're right.
I guess he doesn't like those kind of fish.
What are we going to do?
I don't know.
You don't feel you owe me nothing for a whole day's fishing?
You owe us a day's fishing.
50 miles out and 50 back.
Our deal was for marlin, and all we get is a bunch of trash fish.
Don't expect to see us back again, either.
Mr. Lake, sir, could I have some of the fish?
Take 'em.
Take them all.
But to get them, you're gonna have to clean my boat.
Clean it of the smell of fish, every board and seam.
From now on, this is gonna be a coral reef sightseeing boat.
The devil with fish!
Yes, sir.
Yaah!
Ma!
Ma!
Ma!
Hey, ma!
Sandy, come out!
Sandy, don't do that!
Sandy, come out!
Don't do that!
Please, Sandy!
What's the matter, ma?
I think we better go in the house and talk this over.
Still, even if, uh, uh...
Flipper.
Even if flipper is as gentle as a dog, how will you feed him?
There aren't any fish, not even at silver cove.
Mr. Abrams is bringing in fish from the other keys to sell here.
Mr. Abrams is not going to feed your dolphin.
I'll do chores for him.
He needs help to rebuild his fish house.
What about your own chores?
I'll do them both.
Mine, too.
Please, ma, let me try.
Well...you can try for a while, but you'd better get at that fence first thing in the morning.
Ok, mom.
Hungry again, huh?
All right, it's a deal.
You're hired.
$1.00 an hour.
In fish?
In fish.
Start nailing up the boards.
Hi, Rick.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Roy.
Hey, Kim Parker says you got a porpoise at your place that does tricks.
Dolphin.
You're a bigger liar than she is.
I've been out to your place a couple of times.
It don't do no tricks.
I can prove
I'm not a liar.
How?
Tomorrow afternoon.
Bring your friends, all of them.
Ok.
But everybody's got to bring a ticket.
Ticket?
One fish.
Each kid has got to bring a fish.
Ok.
Hi, Charlie.
Watch him get it.
Take a seat right over there.

Po figures to be in about midnight.
Thank you, Baxter.
It seemed like
10 weeks.
It sure did.
That's why I didn't stop to put the boat in the water.
What is it, po?
Well, maybe it's not right keeping you out here, but, Martha,
10 days in Ocala decided me all over again.
I couldn't trade this for jammed sidewalks, auto smoke, all that hurry.
Unless you said you wanted to.
I don't want to.
None of the work's been done.
Martha?
Well, po, the day after you left, it so happened that a dolphin...
This'll take a while.
We better go inside.
Pa, watch this!
Come on out, son.
I want to talk to you.
Pretty good, huh, pa?
I've never known anybody who's seen anything like it.
It's like the old stories
Nick used to tell about.
But your mother tells me you expect to keep the dolphin.
You'll figure some way, won't you, pa?
Where? The boat's ready.
I'll need the pen.
Couldn't we dig another, maybe?
It took a month and $500 to blast that one out of the coral.
Sandy, the dolphin's well again.
Let him go free.
Pa, he's come to be my friend.
I'd lose him.
I couldn't do that.
He's a friend who's kept you from your work.
Not one thing finished in the 10 days I was gone.
I'll do my work, honest.
How will you feed him?
Doing chores for Mr. Abrams.
What about your own chores?
I'll do them, too.
Son, you've tried that before.
It just didn't work out.
I couldn't let him go, pa.
I've gotten to love him.
Do you remember
Stella Velakis at the funeral?
Didn't she love her husband?
Sandy, for you this may be the first time.
I know it hurts.
Open the fish gate.
I can't, pa.
I can't.
Pa, please don't.
Flipper, don't go.
Flipper, come back.
I sure hope we find flipper.
I never prayed so hard in my life as I did this morning.
Flipper!
Flipper!
Nothing again?
Nothing.
Have you thought about what I said the other day?
About losing things and the people you love?
Uh-huh, like flipper and Nick Velakis.
Like everybody.
Everybody?
Not you and mom.
In time, everybody, son.
But that's not to think about now.
What we've got to make up our minds to is to find fish, look ahead to better days, new friends, and for you...
School, come September.
How come the hurricane hit everything but the schoolhouse?
Flipper!
Boy, am I ever glad to see you!
You say something?
Uh, no, sir.
Stay down. Pa doesn't think you're a good influence.
Sandy!
You'll fall overboard!
Hey, where are you going?
Flipper, where are you going?
You want us to follow you?
You see something?
I thought I saw some fish jumping, towards shore.
Well, that's Green Point.
I don't see anything.
I thought I did.
Well, hang on.
Sandy, come here!
Pa, look!
Healthy, live pompano.
What made you try off green point?
Well, Sandy saw them jumping.
Well, I didn't exactly see them...
Tomorrow I'll be back there at first light, and, Martha, tomorrow I'm bringing back a boatload.
Son, by the way, when I'm gone, will you fix that wire?
Ok.
Flipper!
Where have you been?
Sure missed you!
You didn't have to stay away that long.
Flipper, come here!
Flipper, come up here!
Flipper, don't do that!
Hey, where are you?
Flipper, no!
Flipper, no!
You ate all of pa's pompano!
That's pa coming now.
All of them.
Every last one.
That dolphin got every last one of them.
Pompano's selling in ocala for better than $1.00 a pound, and you let a dolphin into the fish pen.
What have you got to say for yourself?
Pa, the fish you caught today, couldn't I help you get them into the pen?
There were no fish at green point.
Yesterday's catch was just an accident.
Yes, sir.
What's wrong with you, boy?
How old are you, 12?
Almost in your teens?
Or are you 9 or 7 or 5, a child who doesn't have the sense to know what his next meal depends on?
Answer me! The fence, the yard, the nets... not one of your chores done, and now this!
Are you growing up or down?
Aren't you getting any sense of responsibility, of obligation, discipline?
Or are you hanging on to a "feed me, dress me, blow my nose" childhood?
Answer me! Are you?!
I'm sure he would...
If he could.
Sandy, you better go to your room.
One more thing.
Tomorrow you'll go out by yourself.
And by yourself you'll find the fish to replace what that dolphin ate.
And you'll keep going out every day till you've replaced every pound of them.
Yes, sir.
Why?
Because it was the truth.
But you were too rough.
He's just a boy.
Well, he's got to grow up.
Nevertheless, he is a boy.
He's hurt. He's crying.
He still has to be told the truth.
The way you told him?
Shouting?
Nearly taking his head off?
Well, you should have stopped me.
I did.
Look, Martha,
I love that boy... then why don't you tell him?
Men just don't talk that way.
Maybe they should.
Maybe.
Look, sweetheart,
I grew up with the sea.
The sea is never soft.
And he is a Fisherman's son.
Flipper!
Flipper!
Where are you going?
Is it for me?
Can you get me another one?
Oh, flipper!
Near Kingman reef, huh?
There's never been fish there.
What made you try?
I...i just had a feeling.
Well, never mind why.
Let's go back and see.
Pa, will they be alive this time?
Only one way to find out, son.
Pa!
Well, this could mean life for Coral Key again.
We'll stop at the wharf and tell them, then we'll go home.
Only this time, I'll make sure the fish gate stays closed.
But flipper was the one... flipper can find his own fish.
Easy, folks. There's enough for everybody.
Here's a big fat one.
Hold out your sack there.
Sandy, you keep it going with Mr. Porett, will you?
Keep them coming, lad.
Well, what do you think?
Good as it ever was.
But for commercial, there has to be tonnage.
Is there tonnage?
There's never been any at Kingman reef before.
Well, there is now.
Maybe it has to do with the red tide, or it could be a new current from the channel.
Baxter, you and I could sample the whole area in one day.
I'll be at your place at 7:00 in the morning.
Good.
Mmm, smells good.
Ahh!
Lord, whose bounty sustains us, we ask thy favor.
Unite our hearts in family love.
Strengthen our will to serve thee in peace.
Thank thee, o lord, who bringest forth food from the sea for all. Amen.
Pa, when the lord brings forth food, he gets help sometimes, doesn't he?
Well, the lord helps those who help themselves.
I mean, the lord, for instance, would ask one man to help another?
Of course.
Well, sometimes wouldn't the lord ask dolphins to help people?
What's on your mind, Sandy?
It was flipper who led me to Kingman reef.
Flipper, huh?
Yes, pa.
Maybe you saw the same dolphin and maybe you didn't.
It doesn't matter.
Try to understand, son.
If the dolphins come, they tear our nets, they eat our fish, they chase the rest away.
Now, they may be your friends, but when the fish are scarce, they're a deadly enemy.
If they come, we'll kill them.
We have no choice.
Even flipper?
Even flipper.
Flipper!
Flipper!
Where are you?
We ought to be getting pretty close now.
Dolphins.
Hundreds of them.
If we kill a few, maybe the rest will run.
Look, po. There's one that got inside.
I'll get him.
Wait, Baxter.
Ease up.
Sandy!
And so after flipper killed the shark, he lifted me up and brought me back to you, just like you told us about Arion, the Greek poet?
You believe me, don't you, pa?
I saw it.
And, pa, there are lots of fish, millions and millions of them.
And it was flipper who led me to them.
Aren't there plenty for all of us?
I think it was written for us today to share with the dolphins, not to kill them.

Today's top of the news comes from the top of the world.
The unpredictable Admiral Harriman Nelson has done it again.
His brainchild, a fantastic atomic submarine... with an amazing glass nose... is now undergoing final tests below the ice at the North Pole.
To sit in judgment on the final test... the Bureau of Marine Exploration has sent a seaplane... with its top officer, the former vice admiral B.J. Crawford...
to rendezvous with the submarine Seaview in the Arctic.
Flying with him is the congressional watchdog of the budget... penny-pinching congressman
Lewellyn Parker... who had fought a losing fight against what he had termed...
"Nelson's Folly. "
And so the question of the day comes to this-
Will the final test on the U.S.O.S. Seaview... turn it into "Nelson's Folly"... or will it be another triumph of a great man... a great inventor who, despite his oddball reputation... may yet emerge as the predominant scientific genius of our time?
So bon voyage, Admiral Nelson.
Good luck, Seaview.
Well, gentlemen, modesty forbids my adding anything to that.
- Shall we take her down, Captain?
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Let's make it 90 feet at the start.
- Aye, sir.
Diving stations.
Diving stations.
- Any time you're ready, Mr. Thompson.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Stand by.
Clear the decks, Mr. Thompson.
- Decks clear.
- Decks clear.
Prepare to dive.
Close all main ballast tank vents.
Stand by to blow tanks.
Ballast tanks full.
- Close the vent.
- Flood negative.
Full dive on the planes.
Fifteen degrees down bubble.
Secure the air.
- All agreed?
- All agreed.
Dive! All dive!
- Pressure in the boat.
- Up scope.
9-0 feet.
Level off at 9-0 feet.
Down scope.
All ahead two-thirds.
All ahead two-thirds.
- Final trim, Captain.
- Carry on.
Well, final trim, sir.
Depth: 9-0 feet. Speed: two-thirds.
Well, Lee, it's been a long, tough haul... from conception to execution... but, my boy, we've done it.
You've done it, sir. It bears out what you taught us at Annapolis.
"The wild dreams of today... are the practical realities of tomorrow. "
- I'm glad you remembered one of my more temperate quotes.
Some of our colleagues haven't been quite so diplomatic.
Say, speaking of diplomacy, we've got some guests to entertain.
I've met 'em.
Now it's your turn.
And just remember, they hold the purse strings to this "folly" of ours.
- Shall we dress?
- Dress?
Black tie.
Let's go.
- Take the conn, Ed. I'll be fore.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's the most exotic thing I've ever seen.
No more, thank you.
Admiral.
Nice to see you, sir.
- Captain Crane, Dr. Hiller.
- How do you do?
- Congressman Parker.
- How do you do, sir?
You have an expensive toy here, Admiral.
Though it is suitable for sightseeing.
QUite right, sir. We hope to see sights never before seen by man... and by seeing, solve some of the mysteries of the deep.
Sorry for the brief hello when you came aboard...
- but this, uh, toy of mine is a demanding lady.
- Aren't we all.
Washington probably thought you needed a woman's touch around here.
- Research project, isn't it?
- That's right.
The reaction of crewmen under conditions of lengthy confinement?
Yes, Admiral, and I appreciate the honor of being the only woman aboard.
- Ah, but you're not. We have another one.
- Oh?
You'll meet her.
Shall we see the rest of the ship?
Well, I did think that was the purpose of our visit.
- Doctor.
- Congressman.
The control room- the brain of the sub.
Over here, we have our chauffeurs.
It takes two to run this toy- helmsman and planesman.
Now, on a submarine, it's always Christmas.
That's what I've been telling Congress.
Wrong deduction, sir.
That's our Christmas tree.
Tells us when we can dive.
Now, if we go down before all those lights are green... we start bailing.
Over here... we have our ballast control.
- How does it work?
- Like an elevator system, Doctor.
Takes us up and lets us down.
Now, on this side... that is radar.
This is sonar. Sonar keeps us from running into anything under the water.
Radar does the same thing on the surface.
Oh. Try this one, Congressman.
Two "S"s in "progress. "
Uh, now if you'll come down here, Doctor.
This is our missile tracking tape.
If we have to shoot, at least we like to know where the missile's going.
And if we do shoot, over there are the buttons.
The trick is to know which one.
Suppose the other fella shoots first?
In that event, sir, that's the way out.
This way, Doctor, please.
And watch your step here.
The radio shack. Lee?
- Excuse me. This way, please.
- Sparks?
- Make that Washington call in exactly 11 minutes.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Not even Jules Verne dreamed of anything like this.
- The world's only undersea aquarium.
- What on earth is he doing?
- Shark walking.
- Shark walking?
Come on, Bessie. Come on.
You want to get well, don't you?
For ages, man has been trying to learn the secret of the fish.
Now we have a perfect underwater laboratory.
Well, Lucius, back with your fish again, I see.
B.J. It's nice to see you.
Commodore Emery, this is
Dr. Hiller and Congressman Parker.
How do you do, Commodore?
I still don't understand what he's doing.
The commodore regards all sea creatures as personal friends.
He'd rather be remembered for his discovery of a new fish... than as one of the leading physicists of our time.
- May I explain?
- I wish you would.
My little friend Bessie here, we had to drug her in order to do some tests.
Now I'm trying to force some water through her gills so she doesn't drown.
In her present condition, she wouldn't even bite a congressman.
Well, then she's the only one on board who wouldn't.
- Oh, you're much too sensitive, Congressman.
- Right you are, Doctor.
- Come along, everybody.
- See you later, Lucius, I hope.
Come on!
Hup, two, three.
Come on. Get going.
Watch your step there.
You've seen the brain of the sub.
In here is the heart-
the atomic motor room.
- Careful, sir. That's our warning system.
- Disregard.
No one is allowed in there, not even congressmen.
You understand.
For your own safety.
Now, down here you'll find the sting of the ship.
In fact, there are more stings in here than in a hornet's nest.
The missile and escape room.
Congressman, there is more destructive force in this room... than in all the explosives used in World War II.
The missiles are for research.
Experimental torpedoes. You name 'em, we've got 'em. Show 'em, Lee.
Right. Well, let's see.
Here's something new.
This is a magnetic primer. In case we lose power in the control room... we just slap this dude on by hand, and away she goes.
This looks like a pineapple.
Some pineapple.
One bite, and pow.
- Well, don't worry. It can't activate itself.
- Captain?
- Yes, sir?
- Where does this door lead to?
That leads to DavyJones's locker, sir.
I would suggest if you contemplate using it, you use this.
- No, no, thank you.
- No offense, sir. Red.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, shall we continue?
B.J.?
Take a look at this lad.
He's Seaman Smith.
- Recognize him?
- Should I?
Seems only yesterday you were bouncing him on your knees.
- Smith- Ol' Bricktop's boy!
- Yeah.
- Spittin' image of him too.
- Isn't he?
His mother wrote me that he finished his hitch in the navy... so I had him sign up with us on the double.
- He looks a little big for me to bounce on my knee now.
- Yeah.
- Jimmy, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.
And now you're a minisub man.
How do you like the new model?
She handles like a dream, sir.
I can't wait to test her under the ice.
- You will. Good luck, my boy.
- Thank you, sir.
Sorry to break in on your social life.
Back to work.
This should interest you, Doctor.
Dr. Jamieson, Dr. Hiller,
Congressman Parker.
- How do you do?
- Happy to meet you, Congressman.
- Thank you.
- The Dr. Hiller?
It's a pleasure to welcome such a distinguished psychiatrist aboard.
You flatter me. You seem very well equipped here and pleasantly unoccupied.
Well, we're hoping to keep it that way with the help of these little gadgets.
Afraid it's mandatory that you wear our newest style in submarine sportswear.
- May I?
- Thank you.
If you pick up a fatal dose of radiation, it glows red.
- A fatal dose of radiation?
- Oh, there's a warning. It loses all its color first.
By the way, give me one of those for Admiral Crawford.
I hate to break this up, Doc, but I have some healthier places to show our guests.
I'll check in later with you, Doctor.
See ya.
Uh, this way, please.
Ah, there you are.
I've just introduced our guests to Dr. Jamieson.
- By the way, Admiral, I have your dosimeter here.
- Good man,Jamieson.
He'll keep you well filled in on statistics.
Attention!
Well, Admiral, I-I suppose she's your dancing dietitian? And he's your musical chef?
- She is my secretary. And as for him-
- Sorry.
- I'm to blame, sir. I started it all.
- I have no doubt of that.
Doctor, I told you another woman was aboard, but I hardly expected you to meet her... under such boisterous circumstances.
It all seems very gay and happy, and I am here to observe.
Yes, not choreography to a trumpet!
Mr. Romano, belay that noisy horn.
As for you, Miss Connors, we shall have a little talk later.
- Doctor.
- I'll have a little talk now, Lieutenant, outside.
Romano, aren't you about due back on duty?
Not for another two minutes yet, sir.
- Now, Lieutenant-
- Yes?
- Yes, sir.
- Sir!
I'm sure your act will get a wonderful review in the Congressional Record.
- Will they break me, Captain?
- Well, they've broken better men for less.
How do you explain this undignified behavior?
I was just showing them how I'll dance at my wedding.
I see. Well, that is an extenuating circumstance.
- In about three weeks, isn't it?
- And two days and four hours.
Mm-hmm.
Who's the unlucky man?
Pardon me, Captain.
May I?
By all means, Lieutenant.
What did you say about undignified behavior, Captain?
Captain Crane. Control Room, please.
We'll continue this discussion later...
Lieutenant.
Calling Seaview. Calling Seaview.
- Come in, Washington.
- Hello, Seaview.
- We're making contact, sir.
- Very well.
- You called me, sir?
- Yes.
We're just about through to Washington.
Stand by to take her deep.
- Come in.
- All set, sir. Inspector Bergen's on the line.
- Bergen, Nelson here.
- Forget the amenities. How's she running?
Like a clock. We're all set to make our dive under the ice.
Official checkout time: 3-4-2.
- Make it 500 feet.
- Aye, aye, sir.
We'll be out of sound range in a few seconds, Bergen... and then ride radio silence for the next 96 hours.
- Give him my regards.
- B.J. sends his best to you landlubbers.
Is he seasick yet?
He was the worst sailor in the navy.
- Well, good hunting.
- Thank you, Inspector.
Keep a lamp burning.
- Hi, Susan.
- Oh, hi, Cathy.
Personnel file you asked for.
Oh, thanks.
Have some hot coffee?
Best prescription you've written today, Doctor.
Say, this Captain Crane of yours is surprisingly young for a job this size.
He was the youngest sub captain in the navy.
He must have a friend at court.
The admiral?
It's a bad diagnosis, Doctor.
They are almost like father and son, but the captain earned his rank.
- Neither he nor the admiral would have it any other way.
- Oh.
No criticism intended. I'm sure you'll both live happily ever after.
You know, settling down isn't going to be an easy adjustment after all this.
Well, I was born on a farm, and I'm going back.
We bought a small ranch in Colorado.
We bought a small ranch in Colorado.
- What do you read?
- Can't make it out, Captain.
- Iceberg, sir?
- I don't know.
- Nose camera.
- Camera on.
Take over.
I'll be fore.
Here they are.
- Admiral-
- How deep are we?
- Riding at 500 feet. 650 left from keel to bottom.
- Take her to a thousand.
Take her to a thousand feet.
Emergency!
- Sonar?
- Clear overhead, sir.
- Surface!
- Surface! Surface!
Congressman, you and the ladies go aft.
It might be safer there.
Break out the polar gear.
Let's go, B.J.
- Just breaking surface, sir.
- All stop.
- All stop.
- Crack the hatch.
- Crack the hatch!
- Let's go. Come on, B.J.
My God!
The sky's on fire!
What happened?
Come on.
Let's find out.
Get Washington.
- Hurry up. Make it quick. Get Washington.
- Aye, aye, sir.
There's a bad magnetic storm, sir.
- Can you clear it?
- I'm trying, sir.
U.S.O.S. Seaview calling Washington.
Come in, Washington.
- I can't seem to break through, sir.
- Keep trying.
Admiral Nelson calling Bureau of Marine
Exploration. Inspector Bergen.
Rescue team, up and out on the double!
Man on the ice. Belay the parkas.
Rescue team, topside, on the double!
All set, sir.
Inspector Bergen's on the line.
- Pipe this through the ship.
- Aye, aye.
Bergen, we've just seen it.
What is it?
Nelson, we've been calling you for almost three days.
- What's that fire in the sky?
- It's the Van Allen Belt of radiation- the 300-mile level.
It caught fire about 50 hours ago.
Nobody knows how, but a South African observatory... reported heavy meteor activity at about the same time it exploded.
- Theoretically, it's possible.
- What's the forecast?
We just don't know. The U.N. has called an emergency scientific conference.
It's working around the clock.
The world's top brains are there-
Pittar, Zucco, Charbier- and the president wants you there on the double.
- Can you send a plane for me?
- Impossible.
Thermal conditions have grounded all aircraft.
There's nothing flying anywhere in the world.
The temperature has reached
135 degrees... and there's no way of knowing how much hotter it will get.
DEW line headquarters just below the pole reports the polar ice caps are melting.
Okay, Bergen, we're on our way.
Be there in two days.
Godspeed. Out.
- Let's get going, Captain.
- In a moment, sir.
Picked up a survivor. He's in pretty bad shape.
Doc, lend a hand.
Must've been out there for two days.
He's burned to a crisp.
- Who is he?
- I don't know.
Let's get him to sick bay.
- Take her down. Full speed. New York.
- New York?
Aye, aye, sir.
- He had this pooch with him.
- Take care of him.
- Here are the man's papers.
- Take her down, periscope depth.
Dive!
Full dive on the planes.
Flood negative.
- All ahead full.
- All ahead full.
- What's his name?
- Miguel Alvarez.
A civilian scientist. Doing a government survey on Ice Floe Delta.
- He's lucky to be alive.
- So are we.
Yeah.
- How is he, Doctor?
- Severe exposure.
Small wonder lying out there in 135-degrees heat for two days.
- Listen, Doctor.
- Jim, you there?
I- I can't hold on.
It's breaking away.
The ice floe's drifting.
Jim. Jim.
Can you hear me?
Mac, you there? Mac? Mac?
There must be others still out there on that ice.
This is the captain. Reverse course.
Repeat: reverse course.
Rescue team, stand by.
This is Admiral Nelson.
Hold your course.
You heard what the man said. We can't leave this area without searching for survivors.
Captain Crane, if we waste any time at all here... there may be no survivors left anywhere in the world.
Help me.! Please.!
Help me! Mac! Mac!
I've got it, Lieutenant.
Sir?
I didn't know there was a regulation about not picking up survivors.
Lee? Lee?
The chances are no one's still alive out there anyway.
He was still alive, wasn't he?
The blazing
Van Allen Belt continues to spread a path... of death and destruction across the world.
The rising heat has touched off raging forest fires... in the Ural Mountains of Russia... the Black Forest of Germany, and the rich French timberlands.
These film clips from the northwest-
Let's see how the rest of the crew's taking it.
The situation grows more desperate with a report that emergency shipping-
- Are they still at it, Cookie?
- For more than 24 hours, sir.
And they've eaten nothing but coffee and pencils in all that time.
- Excuse me.
- I better see if he needs me.
The projection must be on the nose.
No margin for error.
Now, if these figures prove out-
Keeping you awake, Harry?
Yeah.
Now, the last temperature reading-
It checks. It checks! On the nose!
Lucius, I think we've hit it.
Oh, you're always so sure of everything.
- If the temperature maintains the same rate of progression- - If.
- Yes, if. And if we can reach there by the 29th-
- 29th?
- It has to be the 29th.
- and project at exactly 16 hours-
- B.J., it's right. I don't see how we can miss!
- Do you need me, sir?
Huh? Oh, uh, no, Connors.
Thank you.
- And close the door on the way out, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Lucius?
- Now what?
- Get off that couch.
Let's double-check these figures.
I do more walking for you than I do with the shark.
Yeah. Now, at the present rate of temperature rise-
The fiery sky is now threatening to strike a mortal blow... at the heart of the Midwest farm belt.
Thousands of acres of vital grain... have already shriveled under the intense heat... giving rise to fears of famine... if the flaming belt continues to rage unchecked.
In Italy, all roads leading to Rome and the Vatican... have been jammed for two days.
From all over Europe, the faithful have been streaming towards St. Peter's... to pray for deliverance from the catastrophe which has struck the Earth.
Here now, our television satellite camera in outer space... showing the frightening ring of fire encircling the Earth.
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our broadcast for today.
Well, there will be a hot time in the old world tonight.
That's not even funny, Mac.
- Attention!
- As you were.
Well, you've all seen it.
There's not much that I can add... except to tell you that the situation is far from hopeless.
Right now in New York, the greatest scientific minds in the world... are working around the clock analyzing ways and means of survival.
And don't forget, we have two of the best scientific minds right here on this boat.
Sir? Sir, what about leave?
I live in New York, and I got a baby that's new in the family.
I'm sorry. There hasn't been any word on leaves yet.
But I'll keep you all posted.
We've just received word that
Admiral Nelson is in the building... and he's walking through the lower hallway.
Excitement has been at fever pitch since last night's radio report...
from the submarine Seaview... that the admiral had conceived a plan... which hopefully might extinguish the flaming Van Allen Belt.
Now, several theories are already under consideration by the U.N.
In fact, yesterday, Dr. Zucco, the eminent physicist of Vienna... presented his own plan... which in essence says,
"Hands off. Let's wait and see. "
Unofficial sources tell us that Dr. Zucco's arguments... swayed the scientific body, and they might give him their stamp of approval.
However, in view of Admiral Nelson's tremendous scientific achievements... we've been advised that the international scientific committee... is standing pat until
Nelson's plan can be evaluated.
Pardon the interruption. Some woman is a bit hysterical. Nerves are on edge.
And this may be one of the most important moments in history.
The admiral and Commodore Emery are coming into the conference room right now.
We thank the French delegate for his remarks... and we will take them under advisement.
We acknowledge the arrival... of two of the world's most distinguished scientists...
Admiral Nelson and Commodore Emery.
And now, the chair will listen to Admiral Nelson.
Mr. Chairman... distinguished scientists, ladies and gentlemen.
This planet is impaled on a roasting spit... slowly but inexorably being seared and blistered... by the fire in the sky.
If the Van Allen Belt continues to burn, the world will burn with it.
And no one can doubt that civilization as we know it will disintegrate... if the temperature should rise to 175 degrees.
Now, in the last five days, the recorded temperature rise... has been two degrees every 24 hours.
If that rate is maintained... our planet has a life expectancy of about three weeks.
Therefore-
Therefore, if we are to avoid cremation... we must act at once.
Lucius, let me have those charts of ours and the maps, will you, please?
Thank you. Now, if I may make a comparison.
When a diseased appendage threatens the life of a human body... a doctor has no choice but to amputate.
We have no choice either.
We must amputate the belt, or die.
Amputate? How?
Not with a knife, Doctor, but with a shot in the heart.
The burning belt must be exploded clear of the Earth's magnetic field.
And we have exactly 16 days and... three hours in which to do it.
How do you arrive at that particular timing?
How? The admiral and I have worked out the mathematical formula... and, believe me, our figures are correct.
Oh, he irritates me.
The shot must take place on August the 29th at exactly 4:00 p. m.
The location of this operation is as vital as the time.
A place, uh...
205 miles north-northwest of Guam in the Marianas Islands.
To be exact-
Where are those figures, Lucius? Ah.
To be exact, latitude, 15 degrees north... longitude, 145 degrees east.
The location and the time are dictated by the Earth's rotation... and the consequent trajectory of firing.
Firing of what, Admiral?
An atomic missile, Doctor, fired from the submarine Seaview.
The missile will arc along the burning belt.
As it detonates, it will seed the flames with an overdose of radiation...
'causing the belt to explode outward into space.
Uh, to simplify it, take a toy balloon.
A little too much air, and poof.
No balloon.
A little too much radiation, and-
Poof!. No world!
Insanity! Insanity!
This lunatic scheme will destroy us all.
You gentlemen care to look at our figures?
Give me those.
The admiral's scheme is suicidal insanity.
You should know that, Commodore.
Explode the belt, and you explode the world!
Not if the blast is directed away from us.
No, no, no!
I am diametrically opposed.
I know the chemical composition of the gases within the belt... at the rate of consumption by fire.
My calculations cannot be wrong.!
I say the belt will burn itself out.
At 173 degrees, it will burn itself out.!
Fine. What if it doesn't burn itself out?
You have your plan. I have mine.
Time will judge which one is right.
Doctor, our plan can't wait.
You say the belt will burn out at 173 degrees.
At the present rate of climb, that's August the 30th.
We say it won't burn out, but we can't wait to test our theory... because we must fire the missile on August the 29th.
Otherwise, we lose our angle of trajectory.
Then this scientific body must decide which one of us is right.
I'm not gonna wait and watch the world burn to a crisp.
I have 16 days to get to the Marianas... and I shall need every ounce of speed and every precious moment of time.
Lucius, have the captain stand by to get under way.
- I say the admiral's scheme be referred to committee.!
- There's no time.
- Then I call a vote.
All those in favor of the admiral's scheme?
All those against?
- There's your answer.
- Not mine-yours.
My answer shall come only from the president of the United States.
- Look out!
- We'll never get out of the building.
- We go out the basement.
- Sir, what about the congressman and admiral?
There's no other way.
We'll have to leave them behind.
Whew. This heat.
Hold these, Lieutenant.
Get out of this.
Aboard ship.!
Cast off!.
Clear the decks!
- You all right?
- I'll tell you in just a minute as soon as I get my breath.
- Crash dive.
- What?
- You heard me. Crash dive.
- The U.N. police are on deck. A crash dive will kill 'em.
Give 'em a 15-second warning to clear off, and then dive. That's an order.
Come on, Lucius.
Attention. This is the captain.
This sub will dive in 15 seconds.
Clear the deck.
Sound the klaxon.
- Camera.
- Sail camera on.
Close all main ballast tank vents.
Repeat warning. This sub is diving immediately. Clear the deck.
Clear the deck.
- All right, take her down.
- Prepare to dive!
- Ballast tanks full.
- All green. Dive! Dive!
Bow's under.
Deck's awash.
Stern gone.
- Take the conn, Lieutenant. I'll be in the admiral's cabin.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Lee! He had no other choice.
I hope Washington agrees with you.
I don't understand ordering a crash dive with men on deck.
Zucco just can't be right.
You'd better make deadly sure he's wrong.
- Come in.
- Sir.
Oh, forget it, Lee. Military police swim like fish. It's part of their training.
Now here's our goal- the Marianas.
And we've only got 16 days to get there.
What do you think, Captain?
If the Panama Canal is knocked out... to go around the Horn doubles our distance.
In my opinion,
I'm afraid it's impossible.
Impossible? Sounds like Zucco.
Nothing is impossible.
We'll make it if we get the president's permission.
Captain, set your course for the Marianas as though we already had that permission.
- And give us all the speed you can make.
- Sir-
Captain!
Very well, sir.
Doctor. Mr. Alvarez.
I'd forgotten you two were still aboard.
My orders did not include a trip to the Marianas or wherever you're headed.
Admiral, I must get off this submarine.
There may be no chance to get into port, Doctor.
I'm afraid you'll both have to go along for the ride.
Yes?
Sparks, sir.
No contact yet.
Since the heat went over 139, radio contact is highly erratic.
The radiation has set up a field of static.
Forget the technicalities. Keep at it.
I must talk with the president.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Now, look here, Admiral-
Doctor, as I remember, your research project was "men under stress. "
You couldn't have picked a better laboratory.
Glad to see you up and about, Mr. Alvarez.
Sorry you didn't get ashore... but I'm sure we'll be able to find something to keep you busy.
Don't worry about me, Admiral.
Man must accept what is ordained.
That's a convenient rationalization, but under the circumstances... there seems to be no alternative.
- Check the heat.
- Up scope.
- How hot is it up there?
- 141.2 degrees.
No snow today.
Down scope.
U.S.O.S. Seaview calling Washington.
Come in, Washington.
Twenty-five hours of static in my ear.
Man, I'm gettin' shell shock.
And I'll say it again, loudmouth.
You talk pretty big... behind the admiral's back.
Yeah? Well, here's a message for you, special delivery.
Break it up! Hold it!
Hold it! Knock it off!.
All right, Smithy!
All right, break it up!
Attention!
Now, I don't know who or what started this... but I'm telling you, the next fight ends up in the brig.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.
Now you two men shake hands and forget it.
Carry on.
- QUestion, Captain.
- Shoot.
Are we headin' for the Pacific?
I'd answer that question, Gleason, if I could, but I can't yet.
Well, we certainly are headin' someplace mighty fast.
Sir, maybe-maybe home soon.
I can tell you this. We've been heading south for the last 25 hours.
Whether or not we stay on course depends on the president.
The admiral's still trying to contact him.
As for home... you'll be holding that new baby on your knee before you know it.
But what about this burning belt, Captain?
Captain Crane, I just picked up Miami.
- That's my hometown.
- What about that, huh?
- Sparks, this is the captain. Pipe it through the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.
And the news from Paris is just as disastrous.
The rising water of the Seine has overrun its banks... flooding out thousands of homes in the low-lying areas.
From Moscow, scattered reports indicate a severe shortage of water... as wells from the Ukraine to the Steppes all dry up.
In China and India conditions are chaotic... as riots and pestilence sweep the land.
Meanwhile, the heat has burned like a giant torch across the face of Africa.
Terror-stricken herds of wild animals fleeing from the blazing forests... to the open plains are dying of thirst around mud-caked water holes.
Other reports indicate that steaming water... from the melting
North and South Poles... are being sucked into the air currents... spreading weird, freakish fog banks throughout the world.
In many areas, dense fog severely hampers vital operations.
In this country, the blistering heat continues to blaze... a path of destruction across the Midwest grain belt.
The rich farmland of America is now almost a waste-
Excuse me.
- What's the matter?
- What's the story, Captain?
- Sparks, did we lose contact?
- No, sir.
The admiral ordered a news blackout.
All right, knock it off!.
- Yes?
- Sir, may I ask why you blacked out the news?
A matter of morale, Captain.
No news is better than bad news.
I can't agree, sir. This is no time to cut the men off from the world.
There may be no world at all if we don't start making news instead of listening to it.
- May I be excused, sir?
- Go.
What was that about the fog bank?
Do you remember?
Lee!
All right, Lee.
Simmer down.
Now, I know the admiral was rough, and I also know about maritime regulations.
- It had nothing to do with regulations.
- Lee!
It's a matter of common decency! The men are worried sick about their families.
They have a right to know the facts, good or bad.
- Lee, come have a cup of coffee, talk it over.
- I don't want any coffee.
Please! Now, you know the admiral as well as I do... and we've never known him to be wrong on a question of policy.
- Even if it ruins morale?
- That's just what he hopes to avoid!
He has a strange way of showing it.
There may be some here whose friends and loved ones... have already gone to meet their maker.
If it is God's will that they and we shall die, so be it.
Ajoyous reunion can be only a brief moment away.
That's enough, Mr. Alvarez.
That's more than enough.
What kind of talk is this anyway?
- I only came to offer comfort.
- Comfort? You offer defeatism!
May I remind you this is a federal ship, and these are federal seamen.
By what right do you dare preach of imminent death... of meek resignation to the inevitable?
- Captain, I-
- Nothing is inevitable except defeat... for those who give up without a fight.
I'll remind you to keep your sniveling philosophies to yourself.
Now get forward and stay away from my men.
As you wish, Captain.
Carry on.
Lee! Please, don't do it.
Come in.
Yes, Captain?
Still upset about that news blackout?
As a matter of fact, I am, sir.
And more than that, this man Alvarez is trying to subvert the crew.
If I'm gonna meet your deadline in the Marianas,
I need fighters, not fatalists.
Then order Alvarez to keep away from the crew.
I've already done that.
But if I might suggest, sir...
it would help if you treat the crew as men and not like children.
If you'djust let them in on your plans.!
That has always been my intention,
Captain, but only at the proper time.
- Sparks!
- Sir?
- What luck with Washington?
- Static's gettin'worse, sir.
That Miami pickup was just a freak.
Now all contact's blacked out.
Very well.
Now what?
If you can't reach the president-
- I haven't given up trying.
- But the radio-
- Where are we now, Captain?
- Sir?
Just exactly where are we?
- We're right here, sir.
- Good.
Set a course, close in toward Cape de Sao Roque.
May I ask why, sir?
Static caused by magnetic storms may knock out radio, but it won't affect a telephone cable.
- Telephone cable?
- Yes, Lucius, right here.
Our mine detectors should locate it easily where it crosses the continental shelf.
- Have Engineering rig a tapping device.
- And tap the cable?
If we can't reach the president by radio, we'll tap the cable and phone him... over the Rio-to-London telephone cable.
I like that, Harry.
Thank you.
- Check your mask.
- Right.
- Check.
- Alvarez, I thought I asked for volunteers.
- That's right.
- A little out of character, aren't you?
Hardly out of character, Captain.
Undersea work was part of my job.
All right, let's move out.
- All clear?
- Clear.
Secure the hatch.
- Hatch secure.
- Prepare to flood.
- Ready here.
- Divers ready.
Slow flood.
Slow flood.
- Let's hope this works.
- I wouldn't count on it.
- There's the signal. They've found it.
- Where?
Right out there.
- Get Sparks.
- I can't see anything but the signal.
Stand by, Sparks.
They've located the cable.
- Should be a connection in a minute.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Connection made, Admiral.
Hello? Hello?
This is submarine Seaview.
Can anybody hear us?
- Hello?
- Something's coming in.
- Can you hear us?
- This is London.
Hello?
This is London speaking.
Can you hear me, London?
This is submarine Seaview, Admiral Nelson.
I hear you, Seaview.
Go ahead.
Could you patch me through to Washington?
Hello? Hello?
Come in, London.
Sorry, sir, not a chance.
We've been out of contact with the States for 35 hours.
There's no answer on either the north or south cables.
Harry, we'll never get through.
Could you relay a call through the telephone satellite?
Impossible.
The whole system's flooded out.
London's been evacuated, and-
Hello? Hello?
Come in, London.
Are you there? Hello?
- Break the connection, Sparks. Order that last man in.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Lee?
Oh, am I glad to see you!
Am I glad to see you.
What do you say, Doc?
Apparently, no ribs broken.
You're very fortunate, Captain.
He's all right.
Where's Alva-Thanks.
It was a perfect shot.
Saved my life.
- My hand was guided by the Lord.
- Perhaps.
- But I'm glad your fatalism didn't run its obvious course.
- Lee!
I'm sorry.
That was uncalled for.
- Thanks.
- Oh.
This will have to be seen to, Doctor.
- Bring him to sick bay.
- Please come this way.
- How about you, Romano?
- In the pink, Captain.
- Good.
- You had me kind of worried there for a minute.
- I had myself worried.
- Lee, are you all right?
Well, I'm still in one piece.
What's the news, Admiral?
Disastrous. For all they know, there isn't any Washington.
- No London either from the sound of things.
- What do we do now?
Let's get the ship under way, then have the crew stand by for an announcement.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Lucius.
I'm about to make the most important decision of my life, and I'd like you there.
- Connors.
- Yes, sir.
- Sparks?
- Sir.
- Pipe this through the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Ready, sir.
Now hear this.
Men, this is a time for decision.
You heard the tragic news over the cable.
Contact with Washington is now impossible.
This means we can't get presidential approval of my plan.
Therefore, the final decision must be made now.
There are only two choices.
So with higher directives unavailable and by the authority vested in me...
I have made that final decision.
We are headed for the Marianas to fire the missile.
Now, it's a race against time...
a countdown of only 14 days in which to cross half the world.
If we are to win that race, and we must...
sacrifices will become daily obligations.
The new work schedule will be posted immediately.
And I tell you now, it's a rough one.
just one thing more.
Our world faces its darkest hour... but I am convinced that, with God's help... my plan will succeed and the world will survive.
That is all.
- Doctor.
- Captain.
- Just checking on Alvarez.
- He went forward with Dr. Jamieson.
- Seems to be all right.
- Good.
I wish I could say the same of some of the others.
- George Young.
- Mm-hmm.
I've given him a sedative.
Nervous hysteria.
After all, Doctor, he just became a new father... and it's only his second trip.
It's not necessarily a question of experience.
Now, here's a veteran, your engineer, Lieutenant Hodges.
Lieutenant.
What seems to be your problem, Mr. Hodges?
Just don't feel good, sir.
I'll be okay in an hour or so.
You try and get some rest.
We'll manage.
- Yes, sir.
- Doctor.
- What happened to him?
- Same thing. Hyper neurasthenia.
Your crew is like a capped oil well.
When tension builds up, there's bound to be an explosion.
But these are handpicked men.
Therefore with eyes to see and minds that question.
They know the world's probably on the brink of oblivion... but instead of trying to get to their homes and finding their families... here they are, racing under the sea... driven on by one man's wild scheme, which has no proven scientific basis.
Doctor, this is a submarine, not a nursery school.
- And the admiral's orders must be obeyed.
- I wonder.
Professionally, I am interested to know if the admiral always behaves this way.
- This ruthless compulsion that-
- Doctor. Doctor.
Excuse me.
- Where are we, Romano?
- Sub's right here, Skipper. We ought to raise the-
- Engine Room, what happened?
- The generator's gone out, sir.
- How bad?
- Don't know yet, sir. We're checking.
- All stop!
- All stop, sir.
- What is it, Lee?
- It's the generator. They're checking on it now.
- It's an armature, Captain.
- How long to fix?
- About 10 hours.
- We can't afford to wait 10 hours.
It's dangerous not to wait.
Radar and sonar are both knocked out.
- We can't move without 'em.
- Yes, we can.
There's nothing wrong with the motors.
As for sonar and radar... these are safe waters.
Keep moving and rush those repairs.
That's an order, Captain.
- All ahead two-thirds.
- All ahead two-thirds.
Get on those repairs on the double.
- Hello.
- Oh.
- Oh, you startled me. It's so dark in here.
- I'm sorry.
Well, I'm the one that's sorry.
I didn't thank you for saving Lee.
That was a very brave thing you did, risking your life to save his.
We'll all die when our time comes.
You really believe the world is coming to an end?
Yes, I do.
I had time to think about it out there on the ice.
At first, I was puzzled.
But then I began to see things clearly.
As a child,
I was pledged to the church... but my mind was filled with doubts... enough to make me turn my back on my chosen path.
But out there, the fire burned away my doubts... and I saw the truth... crystal clear in my mind and in my heart.
- I found peace again.
- And resignation?
Has man a right to even try to oppose God's will?
Why should God want to destroy us?
Haven't we tried to destroy ourselves?
I don't agree with anything you say.
I won't.
I doesn't matter. Perhaps our death comes even sooner than the others.
Mines!
Lee! Mines, mines!
Dead ahead!
Hundreds of mines.!
- All stop!
- All stop.
- Take over.
- Aye, aye, sir.
It's caught in the searchlight casing, sir.
- All back. Dead slow.
- All back. Dead slow.
- Hold it! All stop!
- All stop!
We've got to clear it from the outside.
Frogmen.
No, we're too deep. Use the minisub and a torch. Burn through the cable.
- Minisub in all these mines?
- Can you think of a better idea, Captain?
I could a couple of hours ago when I suggested we wait for repairs.
You made your point.
The responsibility is now mine.
Aye, aye, sir.
Harry, take it easy.
This is the captain.
We're in the middle of a minefield.
A cable is caught on the forward searchlight.
I need two volunteers for the minisub.
- Gleason, sir. I'll go.
- Right, Gleason.
Okay, Red, here's your chance for that joyride.
Smith, sir.
Count on me.
- Right, Smith.
- Hey, that's young Jimmy.
Now, look, this is a pretty touchy situation, so play it cool.
Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Good luck.
Damage Patrol, stand by!
What are your orders now, sir?
Back out of the minefield dead slow.
Then proceed with caution until the generator is fixed.
Aye, aye, sir.
All back.
Dead slow.
All back. Dead slow.
Are you all right, sir?
Huh? Yes, yes, of course, Connors.
Perfectly all right.
Are you, Harry?
Gleason was a good man.
So was young Smith.
LittleJimmy.
Look, you have no right to brood, Harry.
You had to take a gamble. Otherwise, your entire plan would have been wrecked.
The commodore's right, sir.
If the generator hadn't gone out-
- You're both very kind, thank you.
- Kind? No, I think-
Hey, that's pretty good, isn't it?
Only about six hours.
What do you say, Connors?
- What's that?
- Nothing important.
It seems that, uh, somebody's concerned about my health and welfare.
Huh?
- Yes?
- This is the captain.
Please come to the sick bay, sir, at once.
- Very well.
- Now what?
Let's find out.
Come along, Connors.
- Hodges?
- He smashed in the medicine chest and swallowed these, Admiral.
He must've typed that note on my machine.
"I was to blame for the death of Gleason and Smith.
I sabotaged the generator... although only God knows why
I did this terrible thing. "
- Sabotage?
- He wasn't responsible, Admiral.
It was a severe nervous breakdown.
That's beside the point, Doctor.
All right, Captain. You blamed me for the death of Gleason and Smith... but here is positive proof that those men were victims... not of my impatience, but of deliberate sabotage.
- Any comments?
- Yes, sir.
Sabotage might be just the beginning.
You're driving my crew to the point of exhaustion... possibly even rebellion.
These are men, not machines.
If they break down or blow up, we'll never meet your deadline.
We'll meet it because we have to meet it.
I'm not worried that your men can't take it. They can.
But I am concerned about your alternative: rebellion.
I found this note in my cabin... just a few minutes ago.
"If you continue your lunatic project, you'll never live to see it completed. "
Hodges will never see it completed.
And he won't bother you anymore.
I'm not so sure that he did.
These notes were not typed on the same machine.
Double the security guard.
All men off duty are restricted to quarters.
Until proved otherwise, everyone is suspect.
- Lee? Don't turn against the admiral.
- I'm not turning against anybody.
Lee, let's not argue, please.
Not now.
Not now.
Lieutenant.
There is something you can do to help.
Take this note sent to the admiral.
- Run a test sample on all the typewriters.
- I don't have to.
The dot's off the small "I."
This was typed on my machine.
- In the admiral's office, Cathy?
- Yes.
- Captain, may I speak freely?
- Please do.
You're so concerned about your crew that you're overlooking other danger signs.
Admiral Nelson's becoming a textbook case.
Taciturnity combined with anxiety, high irritability.
- And now, perhaps delusions of persecution.
- Delusions?
The admiral could've typed that threatening note himself.
Susan! How can you consider such a thing?
Cathy.
Thanks very much for your diagnosis,
Dr. Hiller.
The admiral is showing signs of strain.
However, I'm sure he's in complete command of his senses.
I hope so.
We still have a long way to go.
Fire in the admiral's cabin!
Lee! The admiral's cabin!
- Step up the power to the ventilators!
- Lee! Lee!
It's not smoke.
Look up here. It's gas!
Surface! Surface!
Ship off the port side, sir.
Glasses.
Looks becalm.
On the ship! On the ship!
Do you read me?
Do you read me?
On the ship.!
Do you read me?
Shall I send out a boat, sir?
We can't proceed until we ventilate anyway.
Very well.
Rescue team, up and out on the double.
Check forward.
Check aft.
Let's go.
Dead.
They're all dead.
Let's go.
- What'd you see out there?
- Dead men.
Dead men on a dead ship.
Ain't it about time we went home?
Yeah. You've all got families, haven't you? Well, how about it?
Leave it to me!
- Yes, Lieutenant?
- It's a complete derelict, sir.
Just four days out of Honolulu.
Everyone's dead.
The heat, no water.
We found this in the bar.
It's the Hawaiian Times.
It's dated last Thursday.
I've been asked to speak for some of the crew, sir.
- What is it, Kowski?
- We've been feeling this way for days, but-
- Well, I guess that dead ship brought it to a head.
- Brought what to a head?
Sir, the men feel if it's really the end coming... they ought to be spending their last hours with their wives and families.
Now, we respectfully demand, sir, that you take us back home.
I see.
May I remind all of you that this is a government ship.
Demands made by a crewman or an officer could be considered mutiny.
Shall I so consider it?
Well, speak up!
Captain, as a civilian, may I say a word?
The world may end at any minute now.
Certainly at such a time, these men have a right to choose where to die and with whom.
- Listen, Mr. Alvarez- - Just a minute,
Captain. Mr. Alvarez makes a valid point.
I do not believe the world is ending.
If I did,
I'd be heading for home myself.
But in fairness to everyone, there is some recent news... that may have a bearing on your decision.
It comes from a Honolulu newspaper found on the derelict yacht.
The headline reads: "World Subs Ordered to Stop Seaview from Firing Missile. "
So in addition to all our other problems, we are now a hunted ship... and we may never get a chance to fire the missile.
This in no way alters my plans.
This ship will hold its course.
But in view of this news and your request... the men who want to go home may do so on that yacht.
I think you're fools to try it...
but I'll supply sufficient water... and food to give you a good fighting chance.
Admiral, if we're to meet your deadline to the Marianas... it's madness to split this crew.
- In view of the threat of mutiny, we-
- It's not mutiny yet, Captain.
Your challenge was not taken up by the men.
All our trouble stems from the fanatical desire... on the part of some- not all of them- to go home.
I'd rather have a small loyal crew than risk further sabotage.
- Admiral-
- That's enough, Captain.
Men, you have 15 minutes to make your decision.
Please have any in the sick bay that want to go placed aboard the yacht.
One of you doctors better go along.
The other, stay here.
Dr. Jamieson, I would say that this looks like a job for you.
- Yes, sir.
- Get the supplies rolling, Captain. Excuse me.
- All clear on deck!
- Very well. Captain, take her down.
- Take her down! Hundred feet.
- Hundred feet, flood negative.
- Are you all right, Admiral?
- Perfectly all right, thanks to Captain Crane.
Well, Mr. Alvarez,
I see you decided to stay with us.
Stay or go-what's the difference?
What's to be will be.
- That guy gets on my nerves.
- Cheerful, isn't he?
Stern's under. Deck's awash.
- Full speed ahead, Captain.
- One moment, sir.
Lieutenant, I ask you to take official note of my protest... against the admiral's actions.
- Actions?
- Yes, sir.
Despite my objection, you encouraged desertion.
I can't argue with that. You're within your rights to record a protest.
But, Lieutenant, you can also record this.
Desertion or not, we're better off without a murderer on board.
The note I found was no idle warning.
That fire in my cabin was deliberately set.
Begging your pardon, sir.
Romano.
Fire detail found a cigar burning on the floor, sir.
- Meaning I was smoking in bed?
- Apparently, sir.
Apparently, sir. Except I ran out of cigars before I went to bed.
Lieutenant, file the captain's report.
Then have my cabin cleaned up.
I'm going to check supplies... for more cigars.
Delusions are typical in cases like this.
- I'll be in my quarters.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Yes?
Hi.
Buy you a cup of coffee?
- Look, Lee-
- Now, wait-wait just a minute.
I appreciate your blind loyalty to the admiral.
I felt that way myself until his lunatic actions started to follow a pattern.
- Lunatic actions?
- All right, is this rational?
No search for survivors on Ice Floe Delta.
Crash-dived in New York with police on deck.
Sent a minisub into a minefield which killed two of my men.
- He had to take the chance.
- Drove a fine officer to sabotage and suicide.
Produced a threatening note which he probably wrote himself.
Then he dreamed up this so-called murder attempt... which was actually his smoking in bed.
- I believe him.
- And now, the final straw! He approves of desertion... when we desperately need every able-bodied man on this sub.
- Lord knows what he'll do next.
- Or what you'll do next. Is that it?
"Procedure under which a subordinate officer... may relieve a superior of his command. "
- That's just in case.
- Of what?
If I decide the admiral is irresponsible.
Irresponsible?
Then what are you going to do about the missile? It has to be fired.
Why? If the admiral is crazy, his plan is crazy too.
The U.N. thought so. They've got subs out looking for us right now.
Well, Professor Emery believes in it.
I'm sorry, but until I say so, the matter's closed.
Sir.
Less than eight degrees to Dr. Zucco's burn-out point.
Let's hope he's right.
Hang it up.
- What's our position?
- Guam's due south of us, sir. Just 12 miles to target.
- Yes?
- This is the captain.
We're 12 miles and 50 minutes to zero.
Uh, missile ready for firing?
- All ready, sir.
- I'll speak to the ship.
- Sparks, pipe the admiral though the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Go ahead, sir.
This is the admiral.
The missile is primed... and in exactly 49 minutes it will be fired.
Shortly thereafter, we should know... if our long voyage across the world has been justified.
With luck, we'll soon be on our way home.
That is all.
Connors, we're all out of aspirin here.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll get some.
- Susan, where do you keep the aspirin?
- Top drawer, over there.
Thank you.
- Lucius, what happened to you?
- Oh, nothing.
I got a little too close to one of my sharks. You know Bessie.
- Will he be all right, Doctor?
- It's not serious, Admiral.
I thought Bessie was a friend of your-
Lieutenant, you should be on duty.
Not me, sir.
I'm beat.
- Aren't we all? Get forward.
- Sorry, sir.
As a sick man,
I take my orders from the doctor.
Sick, huh?
In my judgment, you're faking.
With due respect, sir, I think your judgment's been a little rocky lately.
Why, you goldbricking pip-squeak!
What brought that on?
- Go on, tell him.
- I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
Tell him.
First, the doctor tells me to rest.
Then the admiral comes in and orders me back to duty, then pow.
Doctor, I request you certify the admiral as irresponsible, if you agree.
- What?
- I certainly do, Captain.
Master at Arms,
Sick Bay on the double.
Hold it, sir. It was all my fault.
I was disrespectful.
- Captain, you can't arrest the admiral.
- Of course you can't, Lee.
Any other decision would be dangerous for everybody else on board.
Captain, that missile's scheduled to be fired at 4. 00.
Are you still going to permit this?
I guarantee the admiral's plan is sound.
Dr. Zucco and our finest scientific minds don't agree.
- Dr. Zucco.
- You can't do it, and I'm going to warn him.
Lieutenant, confine yourself to your quarters. That's an order.
Follow me.
- Yes?
- Dr. Hiller, this is the admiral.
- Is the captain still there?
- He has just gone forward, Admiral.
Sir.
Sir, I deeply regret this, but under federal regulations...
number 249, governing conduct on the high seas...
I am forced to relieve you of your command.
Arrest?
- Not arrest, sir. I'm placing you on sick list.
- And if I refuse?
I'm afraid you have no choice.
I must also inform you of this, sir.
- I've decided not to fire the missile.
- Lee, for the love of heaven-
Most of the scientists agree the fire will burn itself out at 173 degrees.
I'll wait and see.
Lee,you must fire that missile at 4. 00, or we lose the angle of trajectory.
- Detail.
- Captain, this is Sonar.
- Detail.
- Captain, this is Sonar.
Unidentified fast propellers bearing 0-9-0... about 2,000 yards astern.
They've found us.
Torpedo approaching to starboard!
Left full rudder.
Battle stations. Take off.
Sparks, contact that sub and tell them we're not firing the missile.
Sonar, switch pickup into the P.A.
Battle stations!
Battle stations!
- Move! Move!
- Battle stations!
Whew. Too close.
Sparks, can't you reach that sub?
- There's no answer, sir.
- Rig for attack! Ready torpedoes!
No, no! We can't fire on a U.N. sub.
We've got to make a run for it.
Torpedoes approaching starboard!
Left full rudder!
- We're a sitting duck. Dive!
- I'm giving orders aboard this ship.
I'm not challenging that, but I built this ship!
We can take the pressure of the Mariana
Trench. That sub can't dive as deep.
- Dive, Lee, dive, for heaven's sake!
- Dive, dive!
Dive! Dive!
- 400 feet!
- 1,200 feet.
- 1,200.
- 1,400 feet.
- 2,300 feet.
- 2,300.
- 2,500 feet.
Torpedoes approaching port side.
Right full rudder!
Fools.
They'd better get up fast.
- 3,200 feet.
- She'll blow!
- All stop! Check for damage!
- All stop!
Damage Control, make check!
Fire detail, on the double!
Return to stations!
Return to stations!
- Full emergency power.!
- Full emergency power!
All full!
Captain, this is Sonar. We're picking up something else, real close.
- Well, it can't be another sub.
- Not at this depth.
Lee, what the-
Power Room, reactors up full.
Shoot a charge through the hull.
Aye, aye, sir.
It must give way.
- Full emergency power!
- Full emergency power.!
It's breaking loose.
That did it, Lee.
- All ahead full.
- All ahead full.
Now what happened?
Power Room. Power Room!
- Power Room! Power Room!
- No answer?
Negative.
Control Room, what happened to the reactors?
- Don't know, sir. Theyjust quit.
- I'll find out myself.
The admiral's scheme is suicidal insanity.
If you pick up a fatal dose of radiation, it glows red.
You gotta stop the admiral.
He'll destroy the world.
Doctor, what were you doing in there?
Making sure you don't reach your target position by 4:00.
So you were the saboteur.
Control Room!
Switch to auxiliary, fast!
Aye, aye, sir.
Moving on batteries, sir.
Very well.
What's the temperature reading?
173.2, and the fire's still burning.
I knew it. Zucco was wrong.
There is no burn-out point.
Stand by to fire.
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Sail camera, prepare to track missile.
Sail camera on. Missile Room, stand by, number eight tube.
- Missile Room standing by.
- Target position in 10 minutes.
This is the missile room.
Hatch opening now.
We've made it, Alvarez.
We'll fire that missile on time.
I think not, Admiral.
- Alvarez!
- No man has a right to challenge God's will.
Have you gone completely mad?
Put down that bomb.
Man has sown the seeds of sin.
Now he will reap the whirlwind.
Everybody, stand still.
Lieutenant, get away from the missile button.
Don't move, Admiral.
Hold it!
Attention, everyone!
This is Alvarez.
I have a bomb.
- A bomb?
- If anybody tries to fire the missile...
I'll blow up this ship.
Captain Crane, wherever you are, see that no one interferes.
- Cathy.
- Commodore, where's Lee?
Come on. We have no time to lose.
We must find him.
- Lee!
- What's the matter?
What's the matter, my boy?
- What happened?
- Alvarez has a bomb.
He's holding the ship at bay.
We've only got a few minutes, and the missile's got to be fired.
Alvarez is covering the control room.
- There must be some other way.
- You go to your quarters.
Only eight more minutes, Admiral... and it will be too late for you to do anything.
Diving gear, on the double.
- Which hatch is opened?
- Number eight, sir,just under the bridge.
Alvarez, for heaven's sake, man, come to your senses.
If the missile isn't fired in six minutes-
It won't be. God's will is written across the heavens.
Alvarez, are you saying... that man must accept destruction even though it's in his power to avert it?
It's not for us to judge, Admiral.
Freeze!
Not tojudge, maybe, but we can reason.
If God ordains that man should die without a fight... then why does he give us the will to live?
Your time's run out, Admiral.
This is the admiral.
Surface! Surface!
Surface! Surface!
- You did it!
- Lucius, we did it.
- Admiral, sir.
- Lieutenant.
- Thank your, sir.
- Good luck, lad.
- Thank you.
- Admiral?
Lee.
- Full speed for home, Lee.
- Aye, aye, sir.
In the dark days at the dawn of the 16th century, the conquering hordes of the Turkish Sultan spread terror throughout the civilized world.
The Ottoman Empire swept east across Asia Minor, south across the Mediterranean, north across the Crimea.
Triumphant, the Turkish Sultan turned west to the Ukraine.
Turkish spearheads threatened the frontiers of Poland.
The fate of Europe hung in the balance on the vast fertile plains known as the Steppes.
Your Highness, the Turks have broken our lines.
Call out the reserves.
We have yet to hear from our allies.
The Cossacks.
The whole army's probably lying drunk in the mud.
-The Cossacks will be here.
-We can't wait, Sire.
Zaporozhtzi.
Cutthroats, animals.
Devils with scalp locks.
But there are no such fighters in the world.
Prince Grigory will toast victory at the Royal Pavilion with the Cossack Colonel.
Tell your Prince, the hetman of the Zaporozhtzi only drinks with kings.
My Colonel, have a drink for me with Prince Grigory.
And you will represent me at the Royal Pavilion,
Taras Bulba.
Follow me.
Never set foot under a Polish roof.
Not even a tent.
Colonel Manfred, we will speak here.
It will spare us both embarrassment.
I give you a toast to our common triumph over the infidels.
I'll drink to that.
Gold.
Too bad we're fighting on the same side, huh?
You fight well, Cossack.
How are you known?
Armed guards behind my back.
Your name?
Taras Bulba.
Colonel of the Oumansky Cossacks.
Well, Taras Bulba,
Colonel of the Oumansky Cossacks,
His Majesty is pleased by the results of our alliance.
So pleased he has decided to do you the honor of integrating all Cossack troops into the Polish-Imperial Army.
Do you see this scalp lock?
That means you're speaking to the Zaporozhtzi.
Do you know what Zaporozhtzi means?
The Cossack Brotherhood.
Free men.
We fought with you to rid this land of the Turks because this is our land.
Now take your Polish honor back to Poland and leave us alone.
Leave us alone, Pole.
Colonel Manfred, the Cossack is right.
Honor has nothing to do with this.
We need the Ukraine as a buffer against the East and we need your grain.
We are here and we intend to stay.
That is why His Imperial Majesty is dispersing the Cossack troops before you can turn your horses against us.
That is why we held back our reserves till you had won the battle for us.
Zaporozhtzi !
Holy Father, blessed archangel, what have we done?
What is your will?
I've led you to dishonor, defeat and death.
No.
Devil take you, Mykola.
You are our hetman.
You did not lead us to defeat.
We trusted the Poles.
That was our mistake.
Before the moon changes,
I'm going to have a son.
He may already be born.
And I will kiss the Devil before my son wears the Polish collar.
So, start again, burn our farms, take to the forests, live in the hills.
Kubenko in the south.
Tymoshevsky in the east.
The scalp lock is forbidden.
There's my pledge.
It may take years, it may take a whole generation, but the Cossack Brotherhood will rise again, with fire and sword and repay the Pole measure for measure.
And take the Steppes back for our own.
And may God help us.
Zaporozhtzi, pray to your archangel.
With the burning of their farms, the Cossacks scattered across their beloved Steppes.
There, in the ancient hills,
Taras Bulba's vision was to take root and grow like the sons he bore, steeled from birth for the day when the Cossack Brotherhood would drive the Polish conquerors from their homeland and take back the Steppes for their own.
There, Andrei, there's your lesson.
Armor plate can stop a saber.
If you want to kill a man in armor, what you need is this.
Why don't Cossacks wear armor?
This is our armor, boy.
Faith.
And a good saber arm.
Ostap, watch your brother.
He rides like a Cossack, fights like a Cossack.
And soon, we'll teach him to drink like a Cossack.
Taras Zaporozhtzi !
When you see a Cossack with him is a Cossack
We the brotherhood we are one
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
We the brotherhood we are one
Hey!
Turn to your left then turn to your right
And faces shine brighter than the sun
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Faces shine brighter than the sun
Hey!
When you say Cossack you're saying brother
Cossack and brother mean the same
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Cossack and brother mean the same!
Hey!
We are the Cossacks
We are the Cossacks
Men that no one on earth can tame
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Hi, Zaporozhtzi!
Men that no one on earth can tame
Taras?
In the holy name, are you mad?
-A Cossack scalp lock?
-Don't chatter, magpie.
You make the barber nervous.
You'll be hanged on sight.
The more you talk, the more you show your ignorance.
The scalp lock is the latest fashion imported from the court at Warsaw,
His Polish Majesty has forgiven us our sins.
Royal pardon to all Cossacks.
Watch what you're doing.
Shave me when you're through with papa.
I want a scalp lock.
How's that?
A scalp lock!
You'll wear a scalp lock when you've earned it, boy.
In battle.
You don't need a scalp lock to study Latin.
Latin?
The Poles have opened the Kiev Academy to all Cossacks, and the sons of Taras Bulba will be the first ones there.
Right, Father Mikhail?
The devil we are!
The King is spitting in our eye.
He's saying the Cossacks aren't worth worrying about anymore.
What the devil are you doing up there?
I am repairing the weathercock so that you can tell which way the wind blows.
Papa, what can we learn from the Poles?
Father Mikhail has taught us everything that a Cossack should know.
-A Cossack?
-Yes.
What do you know?
Pots and pans.
Petticoats and apron strings.
That's what you know.
A Cossack should be fighting Poles, that's what I know.
Send me to Kiev with a saber,
I'll teach them what I know.
But I won't go to learn to be a Pole.
You think you are ready to fight me, boy?
Anytime you say, Papa.
All right, Papa.
Come on.
So we go, the sons of Taras Bulba, to learn to be Poles.
I don't know why we go, Papa, but I follow your orders until the day comes that I can throw you in the well.
And that day will come.
So. . .
You don't know why you're going.
So you say you want to fight the Poles.
When you come home, when you've learned everything the Poles know and all there is to know about the Poles, then you'll be ready to fight them, and not before.
And that day will come.
That day will come.
Pigs, lepers and Cossacks around the back.
Follow me.
Andrei Bulba.
Ostap Bulba.
We have opened our schools to you in the hope that we may yet raise a generation of civilized Cossacks, worthy to be counted among the subjects of the Polish crown.
Let it be clear from the start, we will not tolerate the barbaric behavior to which you are accustomed.
You will remove your tunics and prostrate yourselves.
Brother Bartholomew.
I thought we came here to study.
Papa said we should learn everything there is to know about the Poles.
But she's the governor's daughter.
She'd spit on a Cossack.
Amo, amas, amat.
I love, thou lovest, he loves.
Rise ye shepherds on this winter's night
In the skies one wondrous star shines bright
Angel voices bid ye rise
Oh come ye all where Jesus lies
Oh come and greet your Lord!
Come, ye shepherds
Ye have traveled far
Ye have been guided
By his holy star
Gently, gently dawn is creeping
In the manger he is sleeping
Come and greet your Lord
Rise, ye shepherds on this winter's night
In the skies one wondrous star shines bright
Angel voices bid ye rise
Oh come ye all where Jesus lies
Oh come and greet your Lord
Oh, Natalia, your brother and I would like to share a toast with you.
Whoa, there!
Do you think it's funny to run people down?
I'm sorry.
You look so funny when you get angry.
It's hard to look angry with mud on your face.
That's the Academy bell.
You will be late.
They will whip you.
-I'll return this.
-Oh, it doesn't matter.
Tomorrow.
No.
Please.
I won't be here tomorrow.
But I can easily get another one, at the Thieves' Market.
Joseph.
Andrei. . .
Andrei, come on.
Come on, Andrei, the gates are closed.
-The Thieves' Market.
-What did you say?
The gates are closed.
Veni.
Vidi.
Vici.
I came.
I saw.
I conquered.
Make yourselves presentable.
Then report to the Abbot.
Ostap Bulba, you're dismissed.
Go to your studies.
I'm sure that'll be more painful for you than any flogging.
Do you know why I have decided to punish you and not your brother?
It's the Machiavellian theory of statesmanship you taught us.
Divide your enemy and conquer.
Ostap was born a Cossack, he will die a Cossack.
But you distress me, Andrei.
You have a fine mind.
It distresses you to find a Cossack can think?
On the contrary, you gave me hope for the Cossack kind.
To raise yourself out of ignorance and barbarism.
There's a real challenge for a restless spirit.
Must you waste yourself hating all Poles?
Not all Poles.
It's not so much that I hate Poles, sir.
I love the Steppes.
But the Steppes are Poland.
The past is dead.
The wheel of history moves forward and no one can turn it back single-handed.
Not even you, Andrei Bulba.
Well, it's a challenge for a restless spirit.
Remove your cassock and prostrate yourself.
Brother Bartholomew.
Tomorrow?
Where?
After vespers. At the cathedral.
-Are you out of your mind?
-Yes.
And she loves me.
And as soon as we can get out of this monk's trap she's going to be my wife.
Do you know what Papa would do to her?
He'll throw her to the pigs for slop.
Andrei, she's a Pole.
Don't let her make a fool of you.
This Cossack dishonored my sister.
We cannot allow him to disgrace any more Polish families.
Gentlemen, I'll need your assistance.
I'm not going to kill you, Cossack, but I'm going to make sure you never molest another Polish woman as long as you live.
Stand him up.
Stop the Cossacks!
-Brother Bartholomew!
-Brother Bartholomew!
Open the door!
Open the door!
They killed Captain Alex.
-The stables. We'll need horses.
-I'll find Natalia. Saddle three.
Thank you, Lieutenant, for coming here.
It was considerate of you.
Please wait.
My son is dead.
Your brother killed by your Cossack lover.
Tell your servant to pack your belongings.
I'll arrange for an escort to take you out of the city.
You cannot stay here after tonight.
You'll be taken to Dubno.
There you will serve as maid in waiting until you have been trained in the responsibilities of your birth.
Alert the patrol and apprehend my daughter as well.
Natalia!
Go back!
Go back, Andrei ! Go back!
Go back! Go back!
Go back!
Strangers.
Strangers.
Look at the way they ride.
Turn around, son. Turn around.
Don't move, son. Don't move.
Let's take a look at you.
What is this, a skirt?
My sons in skirts.
Let's see if you can run to the well without tripping over your dress.
Papa, the only reason
I'd run to the well is to throw you in.
How do you ride?
Sidesaddle?
Papa, please don't make fun of us.
And why not?
Because if you do, Papa, I'll hit you.
You want to fight?
Anytime you say, Papa.
-Fists?
-What else?
So you think you're tough enough to push the old cock off the roost.
Andrei, Taras.
Look at them.
Two years they haven't seen each other.
What do they do? Try to kill each other.
Well, you've learned to fight a little.
I'll say that for you.
What about you?
Andrei, you're hurt.
Come.
Sit.
So,
-who stuck you?
-A Pole.
Did you kill him?
My little brother did.
What did you fight about?
-A woman.
-A woman !
How do you like that?
Did you see the way he fought me?
With a sword hole in his shoulder.
If we drink we will die
And if we don't drink we will die
So we might as well say what the hell
And let our glasses clink!
Whatever your name you'll be dying just the same
So as long as we are going to die
It is better if we drink
Whatever your name is...
To Andrei and Ostap, sons of Taras.
What's the Latin for vodka?
-The Romans didn't drink vodka.
-That's why the Roman Empire fell.
Scholars.
Some men are lovers
They work under covers
And from lady's bed to lady's bed they leap
But I want to drink to the man nobody drinks to
The fellow who gets into bed and goes to sleep
If we drink we will die
And if we don't drink we will die
So we might as well say what the hell
And let our glasses clink
Go back.
Make room.
Andrei !
Ostap!
Take these horses with your father's blessing.
Kneel.
I am the oldest living Cossack, but I refuse to die sitting on an oven.
Now, you two start some fighting and give an old Cossack a chance to die the way he should.
Welcome to the Cossack Brotherhood.
God ride with you.
We're looking for Taras Bulba,
Colonel of the Oumansky Cossacks.
Filipenko! Korzh !
You sons of the devil.
-Shilo.
-Filipenko.
What more can a man want?
My sons and my friends.
My old partners and my future partners in battle.
So these are your young pups, eh?
Not bad, not bad.
Taras, you've done a good job, eh?
Nice pair, but too small for me.
I'd have to carry this horse on my back.
-I'd like to see that.
-With you on his back.
Let's go.
-Come on.
-Come on, Korzh.
Come on.
Who else can carry a horse on their back all the night?
Who else but an idiot would want to?
The time is at hand when Cossacks will have something better to do than carry horses around the house.
Lift your scalp locks out of the soup, Cossacks.
Pull your sabers out of the bread.
The hetman has raised the golden standard of the archangel.
The Zaporozhtzi are called to arms.
We are marching to war!
Women, more glasses. More vodka.
May God ride with the Zaporozhtzi !
Hey! When do we march?
Every hairy-tongued Cossack with powder in his flask will assemble at Chigirin on the road to Dubno by the first day of Holy Easter Week.
You can whet your blade,
Stepan Kanevsky, and prepare to die like a Cossack should.
Who. . . Who. . . Who are we fighting?
Or doesn't it matter?
Not a devil of a lot.
Who is there to fight except the Poles?
Right. The Poles.
Not this time.
The King of Poland wants an army of 10,000 Cossacks under the Cossack standard, led by Cossack officers, at full pay and booty, to march to the Baltic wars.
And after the war?
We bury our dead, clean our sabers, count our booty, and get drunk.
What the devil is he talking about?
You don't argue with an old pirate like Filipenko.
This we will settle with our hetman, Mykola.
Why must you always be so particular about whose booty you take?
Because the Cossacks fought for the Poles once before, or have you forgotten?
And do you remember, puppy?
You weren't even littered yet.
I'd rather be pulling the Turk's nose if I had my choice.
The plunder is richer and I like the smell of harem girls.
But they say these Baltic princes have slop pots of gold, too, and their women have hips like Percherons.
And what's going to be left of the Steppes when we get back?
Questions! Questions!
Is that what the Poles taught you?
I'll tell you what the Poles taught me.
That a Cossack is an ignorant barbarian good enough to kiss a Pole's foot or fight a Pole's war, but not good enough to walk Polish streets.
Or raise his eyes to a Polish woman.
Or rule his own land.
A Cossack does not question the word of a hetman.
Will you fight or not?
That is the only question.
Not for the Poles.
Devil's blood, Taras, it looks like you've raised a coward for a son.
No man on earth can say a Cossack is a coward.
That can only be proven by the will of God.
Tell him you didn't mean it.
It's only a word. You can't die over a word.
Taras, stop them.
There are words men must die for.
We will ride to the gorge at dawn.
The starting mark will be of your choice.
Take your positions.
Let the will of God be done.
-His shoulder, Papa.
-Return to your place, Cossack.
Your arm, boy.
Let the will of God be done.
Burn this in your memory.
The man who died was a great Cossack, and never forget it.
Was I wrong?
The hetman has called us to the standard.
Now, tomorrow you raise your companies and meet on the march to Chigirin.
Tonight, ride to the village and drink Korzh's soul to hell.
Flaming flatbread, Cossacks.
-Was I wrong?
-You were both wrong.
And you were both right.
Now, we ride to join Mykola on the road to Dubno and I swear it will all be settled.
Come on, Andrei.
Tonight, we sleep under the stars.
We'll be making our bed on the ground for a long while to come.
Women, take them and forget them.
A Cossack can't let a woman worry him.
Right, brother Andrei?
Right, brother Ostap.
Till you find your woman.
Then you take her.
You never forget her.
You try.
You fight, you get drunk.
You tell yourself you're a Cossack.
You tell yourself that Papa's right.
But you never forget her.
You never forget her.
All right, let's not waste time, bless your sons.
Bless you, my sons.
May God's Mother keep you.
Send some little word if you can.
May they always fight bravely, and if not, perish. So, we go.
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Zaporozhtzi !
Welcome, Taras.
-Greetings, Mykola.
-So, we ride together again, to meet Prince Grigory at Dubno.
When I ride to Dubno,
I'm riding to fight the Poles, and anyone who stands with them.
Would you ride against the Zaporozhtzi,
Taras Bulba?
Let the Zaporozhtzi speak for themselves.
Colonels, form your regiments.
You heard the voice of the Zaporozhtzi,
Taras Bulba.
Ride and you ride to your death.
Let him hear your voice.
You swore to wear a patch over one eye until the Steppes were free.
Cover both eyes, Tymoshevsky, so you cannot see yourself.
Can we fight the whole Polish Empire?
-Answer him with your guns.
-Filipenko?
I'll have to shoot you, Taras.
We are sworn by our holy faith,
Taras Bulba.
Would you destroy that?
There's only one way to keep faith with a Pole.
Put your faith in your sword, and the sword in the Pole.
Look to the heavens, Cossacks.
The sun stands at the equinox.
The Holy Easter dawns.
Let the day of the Resurrection of our Lord be the day of the Resurrection of our land.
The Poles have put a sword in our hands.
Turn it on them.
Surrender the standard, Mykola.
Long life to the Zaporozhtzi !
Death to the Poles!
Cossacks.
I signed this covenant, by the holy faith, in the name of our brotherhood.
While I live, you are bound by that oath.
When you march, you have to march forward over the flesh and bones of Ivan Mykola.
Stand aside, Mykola.
Long live Poland !
I count only three regiments.
Three regiments.
To start.
You taught us, Pole.
Back, Zaporozhtzi, back from the wall !
Back, sulfur and oil.
So, you won't fight?
Then starve.
When you're eating cockroaches, then you will come out.
And we will be here.
Do you hear me, Poles?
We will be waiting.
Are we going to fight or weasel in the bushes, sucking eggs?
Why the devil fall back?
Let's go after them and storm the walls.
No.
Here we are. And here we stay, until Dubno is a Cossack city.
He's strong.
He will live, God willing.
First battle. You fought well.
With your eyes open.
He fought well, too.
Too well.
So. . .
How is your strength?
I think you should find out for yourself, Papa.
You're sure you're ready, Cossack?
Your stomach looks a little soft.
Soft?
Not as soft as I thought.
You're right, Papa, too soft.
Not ready.
Big horse.
A lake, a lake is as good as a well, Papa.
So. . .
Listen.
The death bell.
Do you hear that?
The death bell.
There's plague in the city.
They're burning their dead.
Hold your fire.
Wait till they're closer.
Fire.
A Cossack.
There's a Cossack in the city!
There's a Cossack in the city.
Raise the alarm !
Alert the watch !
A Cossack in the city.
Call out the guards.
There's a Cossack in the city.
A Cossack in the city!
-Natalia.
-Andrei.
-We'll get out of this city.
-Yes.
Stop.
The plague.
This part of the city has been condemned.
Let me go there. Please.
They will open the east gate to bury the dead outside of the city.
No.
No.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
Bring out the dead.
-The Cossack!
-Take him.
-A Polish woman !
-The Lady Natalia.
Take them alive!
She had nothing to do with it. Let her go.
-She helped you.
-Let her alone.
Why did you come here?
To conquer Dubno single-handed?
-Let her alone!
-Or to spy?
Let her alone!
Don't tell me the son of Taras Bulba came into the city to rescue a Polish woman.
Let her alone.
Let her alone.
Aliosha!
You can't have that, you'll jangle like an Arab dancing girl.
What are you doing?
We're wrapping the horses' hooves, padding the wheels with sheepskin, and we're tying the axles of the wagons so the Poles won't hear us when we leave.
Why?
Listen to that iron bell, Taras.
Look at the smoke.
You can smell the stench of the Black Death even here.
Look at the sky, hetman.
The dawn is rising over Mecca this very moment.
The Sultan is getting ready to sail.
Dawn is rising over the Steppes, too.
How many good men have died to keep the Steppes free, and the Cossack Brotherhood alive?
But there is also another kind of brotherhood.
The brotherhood of wild beasts, who will desert their own kind.
I will shovel manure, Taras, but I will not eat it.
We followed you here to fight the Poles, not to wait like carrion crows over a rotting carcass.
I'm leaving by nightfall tonight with any Cossack who will follow me.
Will you turn traitor, Filipenko?
Will you give the order to shoot me down, Taras?
-I will shoot you myself.
-Now you listen to me.
You talk about wild animals, Taras, but if we fall killing each other right under the enemy's nose, that is like wild animals.
Is that what brotherhood means?
So. . .
The old man is right.
It is for each Cossack to search his soul and choose the way he will go.
So, they're going.
We stay.
Someday, in years to come, when the Steppes are free, minstrels will sing of this.
How a prince of the Poles surrendered to a meager three regiments of Cossacks.
May God help us.
May God help us.
Where is he?
You heard him during the fever.
It's that Polish woman.
He must have gone into the city to find her.
-You're mad, boy.
-He loves her.
She's been in his blood since the first day at Kiev.
No, not Andrei.
In fever, men dream of women.
But a Cossack could not love a Pole, no.
Death to her!
Death to her!
Death to the Cossack harlot!
Expose her shame!
Let her be purged !
Let her be purged in the fire of our wrath !
-It is difficult to stop a hungry mob.
-I'll get food.
That is easily said, Cossack.
Give me a company of men.
I'll get you the oxen.
Why should I trust the lives of Poles to a Cossack?
Because you're desperate.
And I know a way through the stockade.
You ask me to accept your word?
The handclasp of a Cossack?
I extended my hand to a Cossack once.
It was a Cossack's saber, but very much like this.
Come here, Cossack.
Come here.
Reduce her to ashes!
Burn the witch !
Extend your arm, Cossack.
We take our hands too much for granted.
My first concern was for my sword arm, but I quickly learned to use a sword with my left hand.
Set the torch !
She's your hostage. I'll get food.
You ask me to believe that the son of Taras Bulba would betray the Cossack Brotherhood, his country, his father, for the sake of a woman?
Could father and son be so unlike?
Not so unlike.
Both would be willing to die for the thing they love.
Give me 60 men to divert the Cossacks.
I'll stampede the oxen.
Your reserves can drive them into the city.
The power of love is a constant source of amazement.
If the military could control it, we would conquer the world.
Hear me!
The Cossack will bring food to the city.
Release the woman.
No!
-Burn the traitor.
-Oh, Andrei.
Burn the witch !
I love you, Andrei. I will always love you.
You know that. I love you.
But I can't let you fight against your own people.
I can't do it. Please don't.
-I'm just getting food for the city.
-The Cossacks will fight.
You're a Cossack, Andrei.
I'm a man before I'm a Cossack.
-I'm a Pole.
-You're a woman.
Don't let them use me, please, don't let them use me.
You're the woman that I love.
Don't let them use me to turn you against your own kind.
Natalia, you are my kind.
You are my country.
You are my love.
Cossack!
His Royal Highness is waiting for you.
No, Andrei, no. Don't do it, please.
Don't do it. No, please, it's not too late.
Please, Andrei.
Andrei, please.
Andrei.
There's sulfur and saltpeter in the air, so strong I could almost taste it.
They're filling their powder flasks.
They're coming out, Shilo, they're coming out.
-And we've less than half an army.
-They're coming out, pass the word.
They're coming out, pass the word.
They're going for the oxen.
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
Death to the Poles!
Zaporozhtzi !
Alert the cannoneer.
Prepare bombardment.
Fire!
Where's their strength?
Where's the Cossacks' strength?
They're hard-pressed to give battle to a handful of volunteers.
We won't send out our forces to round up the oxen.
We'll slaughter the Cossack Brotherhood once and for all.
Call out the reserves, we're going to attack.
Damn his soul to hell.
Traitor. After him.
After him. After him.
Get off your horse.
Take off that Polish helmet.
My son.
Why?
Why?
I did what I had to do.
From the day I plunged you in the river to give you life,
I loved you as I loved the Steppes.
You were my pride.
I gave you life.
It is on me to take it away from you.
The whole army is coming out!
-They're attacking in full force.
-Sound the retreat.
-Has your son made a coward of you?
-Sound the retreat!
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
Ride, Filipenko!
Filipenko!
Ride!
-Zaporozhtzi !
-Zaporozhtzi !
We will take him home.
-To be buried on Cossack soil.
-This is Cossack soil now.
Let Andrei be buried here.
In peace.
Now Dubno is a Cossack city.
We will not ravage or plunder.
There will be no more killing.
We will take this city in peace, burn out the plague, open the supply wagons.
We will feed all the people of our city.
Calling Cape Com. Cape Com?
This is Jupiter 16.
Can you give a go for fourth orbit?
Cape Com to Jupiter 16.
Can you confirm 02 pressure is within limit?
Roger. It all looks good in the environmental control system.
OK. Everything looks good from here.
You have a go for fourth orbit.
Jupiter 16. Roger.
You're stowing all loose gear.
Ready for the EVA.
Jupiter 16, this is Cape Com.
Start your EVA when you're ready.
You have time in the other EVAs for experiments.
So don't stay out too long, Chris.
OK, flight.
- Don't worry. We'll stick to plan.
- Roger.
Cape Com to Jupiter 16. On my mark it will be fourplus three seven.
Four, three, two one, mark.
Cape Com, this is Chris.
I'm out.
Everything looks OK.
Good.
The manoeuvring unit works this time.
I used it to get out.
It makes things a lot easier.
Cape Com to Hawaii, this is flight control, come in.
Hawaii, roger.
Hawaii, we expect to start EVA over your station on this pass.
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
An unidentified object is closing on you fast from astern.
Can you see it?
Hawaii, we have nothing here.
Hold while we check the space track.
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
Repeat, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
An unidentified object is on our scope.
We see nothing.
Can you give me a bearing?
Appears to be coming up fast, from astern.
Hey, now I see it.
It's another spacecraft!
Repeat, it's another spacecraft!
Does it looks like a close pass?
You're breaking up. Say again.
- Does it look like a close pass?
- Chris, what's happening?
It's coming right at us.
The front is opening up!
I repeat, the front is opening up!
- It's coming right at us.
- Chris, get back in, get back in!
Do you read me? You're breaking up.
- Repeat, you're breaking up.
- What's happening?
Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
Hawaii to Jupiter 16. Are you receiving?
You're breaking up. Come in, please.
Jupiter 16!
You're breaking up...
My lead line! It's cu...
Hawaii to Jupiter 16, Hawaii to Jupiter 16.
Are you receiving me?
Come in, please. Over.
Hello, Houston.
We've lost radio contact.
We've also lost him on the scope.
Unidentified object is still orbiting.
Alert all stations and track him closely.
It is ridiculous for the Soviet government to deny responsibility.
The Soviet government denies all knowledge of this affair.
The world knows we are a peace-loving people.
I hereby give notice that in 20 days the United States will launch her next spaceship.
My government has instructed me to inform you that any interference with it will be regarded as an act of war.
May I ask what motive our Russian friends would have for wishing to destroy
American spacecraft?
My government sees this as a blatant attempt to gain complete and absolute control of space itself for military purposes.
We don't agree.
Her Majesty's Government is not convinced that this intruder missile originated from Soviet Russia.
Our tracking station in Singapore reported faint echoes of this craft coming down in the Sea of Japan area.
Might I suggest that this is where you should concentrate your intelligence forces?
The prime minister asked me to assure you this is what we propose to do.
As a matter of fact, our man in Hong Kong is working on it now.
Why do Chinese girls taste different from all other girls?
You think we better?
No, just different.
Like Peking duck is different from
Russian caviar, but I love 'em both.
Darling, I give you very best duck.
That would be lovely.
We've had some interesting times together, Ling. I'll be sorry to go.
Take that door.
The bed!
- We're too late.
- At least he died on the job.
He'd have wanted it this way.
We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.
For the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall all be changed.
We therefore commit his body to the deep to be turned into corruption,
Iooking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead.
Present!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
- Carry on.
- Aye aye, sir.
Permission to come aboard?
- Permission granted.
- Thank you.
- Take this officer aft.
- Yes, sir.
Number One, take her up to 90ft.
Course zero four five.
Aye aye, sir.
- Hello, Penny.
- You'd better go right in.
You're late as usual, even from your own funeral.
We corpses have no sense of timing.
In you go... sir.
Thank you... ma'am.
- Sit down, 007.
- Thank you, sir.
- No ill effects?
- None at all, sir.
Now you're dead, perhaps some of your old friends will pay less attention to you.
Give you more elbow room.
You'll need it, too.
This is the big one, 007. That's why
I'm out here. You're fully briefed?
Yes, but there's one thing
I don't understand.
If our Singapore tracking station is correct about the rocket not landing in Russia, where did it land?
We assume it's Japan.
All this is guesswork, but the PM wants us to play it with everything we've got.
- And the aerial reconnaissance?
- All photographed. Nothing.
Are the Japanese equipped to launch such a rocket?
- We don't think so.
- Then who else is?
That's what you've got to find out, and fast.
Before the real shooting starts.
This damn thing could blow up into a full-scale war.
When you get to Tokyo, go to that name and address.
Our man Henderson will contact you there.
- Henderson.
- Captain here. Full ahead.
Right.
- That's all.
- Thank you, sir.
- Sir?
We've only three weeks to the next American launch.
- You know that?
- Yes, sir.
My sources tell me the Russians are planning one even earlier.
- So move fast, 007.
- Yes, sir.
By the way, how was the girl?
Which girl?
The Chinese one we fixed you up with.
Another five minutes, I'd have found out.
She'll never know what she missed.
Miss Moneypenny, give 007 the password we've agreed
- with Japanese SIS.
- Yes, sir.
We tried to think of something you wouldn't forget.
Yes?
I... Iove... you.
Repeat it, please, to make sure you get it.
Don't worry, I get it.
Sayonara.
James... good luck.
Instant Japanese. You may need it.
You forget, I took a first in oriental languages at Cambridge.
Stand by to load.
Lift to the launch!
Tube loaded.
Hubcap open.
Fire.
This is your ticket.
Thank you.
Dozo.
I love you.
I have a car nearby.
- Where do you suggest we go?
- I know a quiet hotel.
- And?
- Where your friend is waiting.
Mr Henderson.
Wasn't Mr Henderson able to come himself?
- I suppose not.
- Why?
He didn't say.
I think it's about hotel-time.
How long have you worked for Henderson?
Long enough to learn not to discuss such matters with strangers.
- Mr Henderson's waiting for you.
- You're not coming in with me?
Mr Henderson would like to see you alone.
Do come in.
Mr Henderson?
At your service.
I believe you wanted to ask me some questions.
Yes. Excuse me.
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you got it right.
I lost that in Singapore in '42.
You must excuse this rather odd mixture of styles, but I refuse to go entirely Japanese.
Very fond of some of these old things.
- You've never been to Japan before?
- No, never.
I myself have lived here for...
28 years.
And I'm just beginning to know my way about.
- Your most vital contact will be Tanaka.
- Tanaka?
He's head of the Japanese secret service.
And his identity is the most closely guarded secret in Japan.
When can I see him?
- You can see Tiger tonight.
- Tiger?
His closest friends are permitted to call him that.
- Do you have any leads of your own?
- Yes, I do.
That's stirred not shaken.
That was right?
Perfect.
Cheers.
Russian vodka. Well done.
Yes, I get it from the doorman at the Russian embassy.
Amongst certain other things.
Now, look. I think London's theory about the missile being fired from this country is right.
I don't know how or where.
And don't ask me who's doing it either.
But I have a fairly shrewd idea that a major foreign power is behind it all.
You mean, apart from Russia and Japan?
It's not Russia, old boy, I'm sure of that.
It's not Japan either.
Although a large Japanese industrial concern is...
Good evening.
Cheers.
Siamese vodka?
There he is!
Freeze!
Get in, quick!
What the hell's the score?
What do you mean?
My job is to help you.
Like you helped Henderson?
I'm taking you to a place of safety.
No, this time I'm taking you.
I want some information now.
- I have no information to give you.
- We'll see about that. Slow down.
Welcome.
Welcome to Japan, Mr Bond.
It is a great pleasure to meet you at last.
And how do you like our country so far?
I am a trifle disappointed at the ease with which I could pull you in.
The one thing my honourable mother taught me long ago was never to get into a car with a strange girl.
But you, I'm afraid, will get into anything with any girl!
You have a lot of energy for a dead man, Mr Bond.
You are James Bond, aren't you?
I am so very pleased to meet you,
Bond-san. I really am.
Permit me to introduce myself.
My name is Tanaka. Please call me Tiger.
If you're Tanaka, how do you feel about me?
I... Iove you.
I'm glad we got that out of the way.
I'd like you to examine these as soon as possible.
They're from Osato's safe.
This is an order for naval stores.
500 kilos of butter, 50 containers of lox.
What is lox?
An American name for smoked salmon.
But it's also the technical name for liquid oxygen.
Which makes rocket fuel.
- Very interesting.
- Yes.
We must go.
The journey out will be more dignified than the journey in.
That wouldn't be difficult.
I'd like that negative enlarged.
OK.
My private train.
I never travel in the streets of Tokyo.
In my position, it would be most unwise.
Very convenient.
I imagine that your Mr M in London has a similar arrangement.
M? Oh yes, but of course.
Then the girl in the white sports car's one of us.
- Aki? Yes.
- Very competent.
- Domo arigato.
- Dozo.
Do you like Japanese sake, or would you prefer vodka martini?
Oh, no. I like sake.
Especially when it's served at the correct temperature.
98.4° Fahrenheit, like this is.
For a European, you are exceptionally cultivated.
- We'll see the photograph you found.
- Good.
A ship and a strip of land.
It could be anywhere.
My men found a microdot on the paper.
Enlarge!
It says, 'Photograph taken by female
American tourist from coastal vessel.'
'The woman has been liquidated as a routine precaution.'
- Can we see the photograph again?
- Of course.
They killed an innocent tourist for taking this?
Can you make it bigger?
Ning-Po.
Check motor vessel Ning-Po. Full details.
All recent movements and present whereabouts.
- What's that on the left?
- Focus on the left!
Ama. Diving girls.
Can you identify that coastline?
Given time, yes.
- Who is the head of Osato Chemicals?
- Mr Osato.
Can you arrange an appointment with him tomorrow?
Of course.
But tonight, consider my house yours.
Including all of my possessions, naturally.
My friend, now you take your first civilised bath.
Really? Well, I like the plumbing.
Place yourself entirely in their hands, my dear Bond-san.
Rule number one... is never do anything for yourself when someone else can do it for you.
- And number two?
- Rule number two: in Japan, men always come first.
Women come second.
I might just retire to here.
Your English girls would never perform this simple service.
I know one or two who might get round to it.
Miss Moneypenny, perhaps?
We have our sources,
Bond-san, just like you.
Don't get the soap in my eye, will you?
I suppose you know what it is about you that fascinates them.
It's the hair on your chest.
Japanese men have beautiful bare skin.
Japanese proverb say,
'Bird never make nest in bare tree.'
If Henderson's theory is right, why would a foreign power want to launch missiles from Japan?
Because if they were discovered, they could deny responsibility.
Especially if some private organisation's doing the work.
- Osato?
- Perhaps.
Mr Osato is one of our greatest industrialists.
No, he's merely a front.
- Who is big enough?
- SPECTRE.
Could be.
Now, massage. Which girl do you select?
I'll settle for this little old lady here.
Good choice.
She's very sexyful.
The last time someone gave me a massage was in Hong Kong.
But unfortunately... we had to cut it short.
We were rudely interrupted by a couple of gunmen.
So, we never got around to finishing it.
This time, you shall finish it.
Aki.
No one will disturb you tonight.
I think I will enjoy very much serving under you.
- Mr Fisher?
- Yes.
- This way, please.
- Thank you.
Please come in, Mr Fisher.
- Mr Osato is expecting you.
- Thank you.
You are three and a half minutes early.
Please be seated.
- How do you do, Mr Fisher?
- How do you do?
Miss Grant, my confidential secretary.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- May we offer you some champagne?
- No, thank you, it's too early for me.
- You're quite sure?
- Quite sure.
I always take a glass in the morning.
- You should try it.
- It's bad for your liver.
- Nonsense, it adds a sparkle to the day.
- I'm sure it does.
A Dom Pérignon '59, Mr Fisher.
- Sure you won't change your mind?
- Well, if you insist.
- Please be seated, Mr Fisher.
- Thank you.
So, you are the new managing director
- of Empire Chemicals?
- Yes.
- What happened to Williamson?
- Williamson?
He died rather suddenly, poor chap.
Ah, so. From what?
He fell into a pulveriser at the works.
Ah, so.
How shocking.
- A very honourable death, all the same.
- Very.
He gained great face with the company.
I hope you are not taking any risks yourself, Mr Fisher.
Me? I never take any risks.
You forgive me for saying so, but...
I think you are taking one now.
I am?
You should give up smoking.
Cigarettes are very bad for your chest.
Mr Osato believes in a healthy chest.
Really?
You must tell me what I can do for you.
We're interested in the bulk-buying of fermentation chemicals.
Monosodium glutamate and ascorbic acid.
- Would you like a manufacturing licence?
- Yes, very much.
I'll have my sales manager get the quotations and delivery dates for you as soon as possible.
We'll contact you later today at your hotel.
- Which hotel are you staying at?
- The Hilton.
Goodbye, Mr Fisher.
- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure to meet you, too.
- Goodbye, Miss Brandt.
- Goodbye, Mr Fisher.
Kill him.
Get down!
294 here. Tiger, immediate.
Come in, 294.
Zero-zero is with me. We are being chased by gunmen, in black sedan.
I'm heading south for Highway Two.
Arrange usual reception, please.
- How's that for Japanese efficiency?
- Just a drop in the ocean.
- Zero-zero?
- Yes, Tiger.
Ning-Po is owned by Osato Chemicals.
- That fits. Go on.
- Vessel now loading in Kobe docks.
Sailing for Shanghai at 5pm this afternoon.
Suggest you proceed Kobe immediately to look her over.
- Can we make it?
- Yes, just.
Proceeding immediately, Kobe docks.
Tiger, contact M.
Tell him to send Little Nellie.
Repeat, Little Nellie.
Suggest she be accompanied by her father.
Most urgent. Understood?
Understood.
Condensation: ice-cold. Liquid oxygen.
Get out of here. Contact Tanaka.
I'm not leaving you.
Tell him to keep that ship shadowed.
Go now.
Take him to Number 11.
- Wake him up.
- Are you finished?
Where am l?
You're in my cabin on the Ning-Po.
Leave him to me now. Wait in there.
And shut the door.
I've got you now.
Enjoy yourself.
- Who are you working for?
- Empire Chemicals, you know that.
- Do all their people carry guns?
- When they're abroad, yes.
And why were you snooping around the docks?
I like ships. And I used to be a sailor.
You are a liar.
- Do you know what this is?
- I'd rather not.
Plastic surgeons call it a dermatome.
They use it to slice off skin.
I hope you won't force me to use it.
Now, what's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?
I have a confession to make.
What?
Actually, I'm a spy.
I know that.
I suppose you know that industrial secrets are big business?
I've stolen Osato's new process for making monosodium glutamate.
And...
Well, it's worth
So?
I'll split it with you if you'll get me out of here and back to Tokyo.
That's a nice offer.
- How about it?
- I'm afraid not.
Why?
Osato would kill me.
We could fly to Europe tomorrow, you and l.
The things I do for England.
Now, you are going to need some very close... protection tonight in Tokyo because... well, that's when they'll try and get at you.
You'll need the best man we've got.
And who do you suggest?
Well, me.
I'm afraid I have another appointment tonight, Mr Fisher.
I'm awfully sorry to leave you... but I have to get off.
Chasing girls will be the end of you,
Bond-san, I have told you before.
He didn't chase her.
He did it so I could get away.
He wouldn't touch that horrible girl.
- Would you?
- Heaven forbid.
Any progress?
Yes. We identified the coastline in the photograph.
It is an island called Matsu, on the direct route between Kobe and Shanghai.
We shadowed the Ning-Po in a helicopter.
- Did it stop at the island?
- I think so.
It was a very dark night.
Impossible to see her all the time.
But we know she stopped somewhere.
Look at these.
That one we took last night.
And that one, early this morning.
- Notice, please, the water line.
- You're right.
Fully laden here and empty here.
I want to take a fast look at the island now.
- Has Little Nellie arrived yet?
- Yes, and her father.
Ah, welcome to Japan, Dad.
Is my little girl hot and ready?
Look, 007, I've had a long and tiring journey, probably to no purpose.
I'm in no mood for your juvenile quips.
I have much curiosity, Bond-san.
What is Little Nellie?
She's a wonderful girl.
Very small, quite fast.
Can do anything. Just your type.
A toy helicopter?
No, it's certainly not a toy! You'll see.
We've made some improvements since you used her last.
- I'll give you the drill.
- This is only for children. Don't use it!
Take my helicopter instead.
Right. Now pay attention.
- Two machine guns, fixed.
- Synchronised to what?
100 yards, using incendiaries and high explosives.
Two rocket launchers,
- forward-firing on either side.
- Fine.
Now, these fire heat-seeking air-to-air missiles. 60 a minute.
Good.
Flame guns. Two of 'em. Firing astern.
- What range?
- 80 yards. Two smoke ejectors next door.
Aerial mines. Now remember, use them only when directly above target.
- That's about the lot. You know the rest.
- Yes.
Cine camera.
- Tanaka, listen in on 410 megacycles.
- Good luck!
I'll contact you when I get over the island.
Be careful, Bond-san!
Hello, Base One.
I'm over the island and the fishing village.
Nothing to report.
We'll keep listening.
Hello, Base One.
There's nothing here but volcanoes.
Understood. Carry on.
- Hello, Base One.
- Listening.
Little Nellie got a hot reception.
Four big-shots made improper advances, but she defended her honour with great success.
- Heading for home.
- Do not come home.
Russian space shot imminent.
Proceed vector4-6 degrees and await instructions.
- Understood?
- Roger and out.
Clear the area. Clear the area.
Prepare for reception.
Prepare for reception.
Radar blackout is now complete.
Radar blackout is now complete.
Moscow radio's already saying we did it.
The president's called a press conference for 2pm.
He'll deny emphatically we were involved.
- But can we prove it?
- Of course not.
No one will believe the Russians did it.
Now they'll use the excuse to shoot down our next Jupiter.
Houston to Washington. We followed him for one orbit, now he's offthe screen.
That means he's coming down.
- Yeah, but where?
- Some place in Russia. It has to be.
The British theory about Japan is nonsense.
- Forget Japan.
- I agree.
We've re-photographed every square inch.
Ventilator fans to full power.
Open all air ducts.
Area safe to enter.
All crews to stations.
All air ducts to normal.
Air ducts opened.
- Close crater.
- Closing crater.
Fire guards to station.
Ventilator fans to normal. Open shutters.
Reception complete.
Withdraw captive spaceship.
Guards to stations.
Remove the prisoners.
I shall be in my apartment.
I may send for you later.
I must congratulate you, gentlemen, upon your superb equipment.
We congratulate you, sir, upon the way you handle it.
Our clients are satisfied with the progress so far?
- My government is quite satisfied.
- Good.
Hans!
You will see that my piranha fish get very hungry.
They can strip a man to the bone in 30 seconds.
I have decided to ask for a little money in advance.
I want the sum of 100 million dollars, in gold bullion, deposited in our account in Buenos Aires.
Our agreement states no money should be paid until war has broken out between Russia and the United States.
- This is extortion.
- Extortion is my business.
Go and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy.
Osato and Number 11, report now.
An unknown Englishman was in your office the other day.
Correct, Number One.
- Do you know what gun this is?
- Walther PPK.
Only one person we know uses this sort of gun.
James Bond.
- But Bond is dead.
- It was in all the newspapers.
Rubbish.
Bond is alive.
Unless you killed him, Mr Osato?
Don't tell me you let him go.
I gave Number 11 the strictest orders to eliminate him.
And did she?
She failed.
You should have killed him.
You had plenty of opportunity.
This organisation does not tolerate failure.
- I know, but you see, l...
- Go!
Well?
Osato!
Kill Bond! Now!
Yes, Number One. Yes. Yes, yes.
- Hello.
- Bad news from outer space.
Yes, I heard it. Now the Russians are accusing the Americans.
Next time it will be war.
- We'll have to get down to the volcanoes.
- I agree.
We'll also need a company of first-rate men.
Do you have any commandos here?
I have much, much better.
Ninjas. Top-secret, Bond-san.
This is my ninja training school.
- Ninjas?
- The art of concealment and surprise.
This must develop very fast reflex actions.
And spiritual strength.
Now, we will see some modern ninjas.
My plan is this.
I make a base on the Ama island.
100 of my ninjas will slide in unseen.
They will be workers and fishermen.
- What about me?
- Later.
But for the moment, these will interest you. Rocket guns.
Very powerful.
See the holes in the back for jet propulsion.
- It's a fine gun.
- All rocket guns.
This is our special baby rocket.
Very useful for people who smoke too many cigarettes, like you.
- Accurate up to 30 yards.
- Very neat.
- It can save your life.
- You sound like a commercial.
- What's the plan for me?
- First, you become a Japanese.
Second, you train hard and quickly to become a ninja like us.
And third, to give you extra-special cover, you take a wife.
Regretfully impossible.
You must marry Ama girl.
One who is known on the island.
- Is she pretty?
- She has a face like a pig.
- To hell with that idea.
- But this is duty.
The girl I have chosen is an agent of mine.
But first, you must become Japanese.
Eyepieces to Hera.
Why don't you just dye the parts that show?
- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.
Tiger said, from now on, you must do everything Japanese-style.
Everything?
Good for Tiger.
I'm...
I... I...
Aki!
I'm...
She's dead.
Poisoned.
Tiger, we must get to that island.
You're almost ready.
Just two more days' training.
- You killed him.
- Yeah, he tried to kill me.
This man is a stranger from outside.
It's lucky we're getting out of here.
Tomorrow you will be a poor Japanese worker, with humble Japanese wife.
Yeah, with a face like a pig.
My men are already ashore.
All over the island.
We have four days left.
It is not much time.
This is my house.
My friend has made us some food.
Do you live here alone?
Yes. My parents are dead.
Sit down, please.
Oysters.
Is this the only room there is?
Yes.
That is your bed.
I shall sleep over there.
- We're supposed to be married.
- Think again, please.
You gave false name to priest.
But we must keep up appearances!
We're on our honeymoon.
No honeymoon. This is business.
I won't need these.
- Bond-san.
- What's wrong?
The Americans have changed the launching date.
The countdown has already started.
The president has given a last warning to the Russians.
- When does it go up?
- Tonight, midnight. Our time.
- Did your men search the island?
- Yes. There is nothing but volcanoes.
Everything is so normal around here.
- Nothing happens.
- One thing has happened.
Yesterday an Ama girl rowed her boat into Ryuzaki.
- Ryuzaki?
- It is a big cave on the mainland.
And when her boat floated out again, she was dead.
- Was that the funeral we saw yesterday?
- Yes.
- How did she die?
- Nobody knows.
- Can you take me to this cave?
- Yes.
We'll slip away from the fishing fleet in the morning.
All right?
Now, where is this cave?
It's straight across.
The cave is over there.
Gas. Get over the side.
Quick!
Phosgene gas, to keep the visitors away.
Did you notice the sulphur on the walls?
- The yellow?
- Yes.
It was once an underground outlet for the volcanic lava.
- There must be a long tunnel.
- Miles of it.
It leads all the way, right up to the top.
That's where we have to go.
Can you make it?
Of course. It's business.
Good.
May I rest a moment?
Surely.
It's hard work.
Some honeymoon!
It's going down! lnto the volcano!
Heliport to position.
The honeymoon's over. Come on.
This volcano isn't active, is it?
It never has been. Not in my lifetime.
There's been some terrific heat here recently.
What happened to the helicopter?
It's down there somewhere.
Come on.
Stand by. Mark.
Stand by for ten-second countdown.
All units worldwide will remain at readiness so long as the spacecraft is in orbit.
Ignition.
This is it, gentlemen.
All we can do now is wait and pray.
Is that deep?
They usually are - very.
It's metal!
Wait here.
Heliport to takeoffposition.

Re-coordinate with target vehicle.
A new update with target vehicle has been received from computers.
We now have T minus seven minutes and counting.
You made a mistake, my friend.
No astronaut enters the capsule with his air conditioner.
Remove his helmet!
James Bond.
Allow me to introduce myself.
I am Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
They told me you were assassinated in Hong Kong.
Yes, this is my second life.
You only live twice, Mr Bond.
Target vehicle passing over central Russia.
Approaching Mongolia.
Track is as predicted. All computers...
As you see,
I am about to inaugurate a little war.
In a matter of hours, when America and Russia have annihilated each other, we shall see a new power dominating the world.

Hans, our job will soon be done.
Blow them up as soon as they have captured the Americans. Here is the key to operate the exploder button.
There are men in the crater!
Crater guns, fire.
Crater guns, open fire.
The firing power inside my crater is enough to annihilate a small army.
You can watch it all on TV.
It's the last programme you're likely to see.
If I'm going to be forced to watch television, may I smoke?
Yes. Give him his cigarettes.
It won't be the nicotine that kills you, Mr Bond.
Armed guards to control room.
- Close the crater.
- Close crater!
I shall look forward personally to exterminating you, Mr Bond.
Close the shutters.
We are now impregnable.
Interception takes place in eight minutes.
Nothing can prevent that.
Impregnable?
- Come with me, Mr Bond.
- Bird 1 to base. Locked on target.
- Osato?
- Yes, Number One?
Base calling Bird 1.
You are to assume full control of operation from now on.
Seven minutes to interception.
Roger, Base One.
Houston, this is Hawaii.
We have an unidentified object on scope.
Order first alert. Arm all weapons.
Interception will occur in six minutes.
This is the price of failure, Mr Bond.
Come on.
Goodbye, Mr Bond.
There's an exploder button in the control room. We've got to get up there.
Impossible. Too well defended.
Evacuate the control!
Evacuate the control!
Control room technicians.
There must be another way up there.
Give me cover till I get to the staircase.
Bon appétit.
Closing fast on our vehicle.
Orbit identical.
All units stand by for codeword.
Codeword is imminent.
I repeat, closing fast on our vehicle.
It's blown up! The enemy!
I repeat, the enemy has blown up.
All units will return to first alert.
Codeword is not -
I say again, not - imminent.
Tiger, we've done it.
Down the tunnel!
Steady.
Now... about that honeymoon.
Why not?
But they'll never let you stay.
But they'll never find us.
- Dinghy's on board, sir.
- Tell him to come below and report.
It'll be a pleasure, sir.
Coffee?
Coffee, Rick?
All right, come on, Peggy. lt'll serve you right if you get burned. lt won't be the first time.
Oh my, aren't we bitter.
That's no way to start your vacation. lt's no vacation.
Oh? No trouble, l hope.
Well, l'm going home to get away from trouble.
Now there's a switch, even for you.
Uh...
Oh, thank you.
What's up, Rick? l got fired.
Oh, l'm sorry.
But, knowing you, you must have brought it on yourself.
Not this time.
You'll find a spot with another airline.
Have you tried United? l've tried them all.
But you're a good pilot.
Well, nobody questions my ability. lt's my reputation.
Nobody will believe l've changed. l know. lt's the girls that stay the same.
Believe it or not, this time, l was innocent. l was sitting there flying, minding my own business when this soft feminine voice came over the intercom and told me there was something smoldering in the galley.
Don't tell me-- she was.
Right.
But l took it straight and l went back to investigate.
And she took advantage of you.
Are you going to tell it, or am l?
All right, so she didn't take advantage of you.
She kissed me.
That doesn't sound too bad.
You never fought it before.
Well, we hit some turbulence and we both wound up on the deck in full view of the passengers.
Well, it makes a good story.
Uh, how about having dinner with me tonight?
Help me forget my troubles.
Uh-uh.
You've been away from the islands too long, skipper. l got over you years ago.
Well, thanks for the sympathetic ear.
Part of the service.
Welcome to paradise,
Hawaiian style.
Hawaii
USA
Hawaii
USA
We're flyin'
Comin' your way
Aloha
Hawaii, USA
Gee, it's great
To be in that 50th state
The land of enchanted dreams
What an isle
Well, it's heaven, tropical style
Where love weaves a spell lt seems
Gee, what fun
Just to swim and surf in the sun
While the trade winds caress
The sea
What a sight
Those exotic scenes of delight
Are waiting for you
And me
Hawaii
USA
Hawaii
USA...
Thanks a lot, Johnny.
Hey, missionary.
Oh, hi, native.
Welcome back to Paradise.
Why didn't you wire me? l'd have been at the ramp with a dozen Wahines. l wanted to surprise you.
You did, you did.
How much vacation time you got? lndefinitely. l got, l got let out of the airlines.
So, what happened this time? What'd you do?
You'd never believe it.
All right, don't tell me.
So what'll you do now, missionary?
Aw, come on, Danny, there hasn't been a missionary in my family for a hundred years.
You know that.
You can take the boy out of the church but you can't keep his hands out of the cookie jar.
Who was the cookie?
All right, she was a stewardess.
But l had nothing to do with it.
All l had on my mind was helping her put out the fire in the galley.
And what was on fire?
She was.
Hey, maybe you can give me a job.
Are you out of your pineapple-pickin' mind? l go for days without even a sniff of a customer and with five kids to feed.
You got five kids?
At last count.
What are you trying to do, sink the island?
Well, l've got this nervous habit...
Well, you better try biting your nails.
Hey, l set some lobster nets out on the reef.
How about a lobster luau?
You haven't seen Betty for a long time.
Well, l'd like to, Danny but l've got to find a job and a place to live.
Tomorrow.
Tonight, you stay with us. ln the morning, you can take my car and go find a job.
-Five kids?
-Yeah.
You got yourself a baby-sitter.
Finish it up, Earl. ls this a picnic, Mama? lt's a welcome home party for Uncle Rick.
Now watch your step. l have the biggest watermelon!
No, l do.
Now, now, no fighting.
Now be careful, that's heavy.
Here you go, Rick.
Papaya and liquid oxygen.
What time do l blast off?
You won't know a thing until you're in orbit. lt's the reentry that's rough.
Are you two reminiscing about old times?
We're just talking about Rick's little adventure with a...
Uh, uh... l think the kids would like to hear about my, uh, skin-diving off Malibu.
That would be fun.
Yeah, sit down.
Well, l was down about 50 feet, and l got lost.
And a beautiful mermaid came by and offered me a can of tuna.
Oh, Uncle Rick...
What happened then,
Uncle Rick?
Well, uh, uh... l ate the tuna, see... and, uh, l held my breath and l started swimming and l swam all the way here.
That's why l'm so tired.
But you came in Daddy's car.
We saw you.
Mmm, well, actually, the, uh, the real truth is, uh... l flew from
San Francisco, see and my wings are tired.
But only angels have wings.
And you're no angel, because l heard Daddy say so.
Big mouth.
Why don't you take the kids and go help your mother?
Okay, l'll go.
But don't believe any of his stories, Mommy.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Number-one child's very bright.
They all are. lt's tough to keep up with them.
Yeah, it must be tough to keep track of them.
Ah, you'll find out one of these days.
Him married?
Not a chance.
Marriage and children are for squares like us. l'm glad you're back, Rick. lt gets dull without you around.
You know, no planes being taxied into offices on New Year's Eve, no girls calling at all hours of the night looking for you no irate fathers writing to newspapers...
Yeah, l guess l did burn some bridges behind me.
Well, you can always go back to crop dusting or, or working for the Blackmont outfit. l hear they're looking for someone to pilot their helicopters.
Oh, l'm not that desperate.
Where will you live, Rick? l'll get an apartment in Eva Beach.
Well, there goes that neighborhood.
Oh!
Hey, kids, quiet it down!
We want Queenie!
Maya-maya, where's my papaya?
Boolu-boolu, it's in Honolulu.
Boolu-boolu, it's in Honolulu.
Hey, Uncle Rick, look. l'm Queenie Wahine.
You know, you look like a little queen.
Come on, Uncle Rick, tell us about Queenie Wahine.
Come on, tell us a story!
She sells sea shells, by the seashore
But l know a gal who sells so much more
Queenie Wahine's papaya rates higher
Than pineapple, pumpkin or poi
Please pick her papaya
Put Queenie Wahine in perfect, perpetual joy
Though some peoples' palates prefer pickle salads
Plum pudding, pink popcorn, peach pie
Oh, Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by
Queenie Wahine's papaya rates higher
Than pineapple, pumpkin or poi
Please pick her papaya
Put Queenie Wahine in perfect, perpetual joy
Though some people's palates prefer pickle salads
Plum pudding
Pink popcorn
Peach pie
Oh, Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by
Queenie Wahine's papaya rates higher
Than pineapple, pumpkin or poi
Please pick her papaya
Put Queenie Wahine in perfect, perpetual joy
Though some people's palates prefer pickle salads
Plum pudding, pink popcorn, peach pie
Oh, Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by.
You're fun, Uncle Rick!
You're fun!
Hey, Uncle Rick!
Hey, Danny, you got room for one more?
Sure, hop in.
Mr. Cubberson is in alligator shoes.
Hmm, so l see.
Yes, l certainly am.
And our intention is to see everyone in alligator shoes,
Mister, uh...
Uh, Richards.
Rick Richards.
-Aloha.
-Aloha.
Mr. Cubberson's on his way to the shoe convention on Maui.
Oh, the boys always depend on me for my old keynote address. l mustn't be late and let them down.
They know they can count on Cubberson.
How'd it go? lt's rough out.
That's too bad.
You'll find another spot.
Good commercial pilots are rare.
And so are alligator shoes and that's what we're trying to sell.
Alligator shoes are a symbol of prestige, of wealth, of importance.
Hey, yeah, you're right,
Mr. Cubberson.
Ah, l'm not going back to work for somebody else,
Danny.
Let me take the controls, l want to show you a place l looked at this morning.
Why are we sinking?
Where are the life jackets?
Just a slight detour,
Mr. Cubberson.
No extra charge.
Oh, but l'm late now and l have to make that opening speech.
We'll get you there in plenty of time.
Beautiful, aren't they?
Yeah, but, uh, so are
Mr. Cubberson's alligator shoes.
What am l supposed to be seeing?
'Cause whatever it is, l don't.
Well, l came over to see
Blackmont, like you said but instead of going to work for him we figured out a way to scratch each other's backs. l sold him on going into partnership with us.
He scratches our backs by putting up the choppers we scratch his by putting up the service.
Ah, what kind of service?
A personal air service.
Look, we both know these islands, Danny.
We could use the choppers to fly tourists to places they could never reach by any other means of transportation.
Three passengers at a time?
We couldn't afford it, and neither could the customers.
Why not?
Cubberson has the right idea.
Give the people a little something special and they'll pay for it.
Two choppers would make it pay us.
And all we'd provide is the service.
Well, not exactly.
Blackmont wants us to put up $10,000 bond.
Yeah, l knew there was a catch.
Where do we get that kind of money?
Well, my severance pay and the loan you're going to get on your plane.
And if we can't meet the payments we lose both the choppers and the bond, right?
Ah, yes, but we won't let that happen.
Sorry, old buddy. l love you like a brother, but it's too risky.
Come on,
Cubberson's waiting.
Aloha, aloha!
Aloha!
Gentlemen, l greet you. lt's delightful to be here.
Oh, it's, it's good to be well-liked.
Danny, l'd like you to meet somebody.
We'll see you later,
Mr. Cubberson.
Sure.
Lehua!
Do l know you?
Allow me to introduce myself.
Rick Richards.
This is my buddy, Danny Kohana.
Aren't you a little late?
Late?
We had a date, remember?
Well, how could l forget? When?
For dinner.
June 4, two years ago.
And you've been waiting all this time?
Well, you must be starving.
Not anymore. l ate my heart out for a day or two.
Lehua, l-l know l gave you a bad time but l'm a different guy now.
Any change would be an improvement. l said l was sorry. l'd like to make it up to you.
How about joining us for lunch?
Well, l'm on duty right now.
What time do you have?
Fine. l'll meet you at exactly same time two years from today.
Lehua, l got a proposition for you.
The same one?
We can help each other.
Sorry, we don't provide that service anymore. lf you just listen for a minute.
Look, Danny and l are starting a helicopter line for the tourists.
Hey, wait.
We know these islands better than anybody.
We can take people to places that nobody else can.
And you can help by lining up some passengers for us.
Not me, honey. l been that route.
When you take somebody for a ride it's a long trip.
Uh, chow time? l'm not giving up that easy.
Don't go away.
Lehua, two years ago, l got sent to the mainland. l tried to phone you before l left.
For your cards and letters, l thank you.
Well, l'm not much for writing, but l thought about you a lot. l wish l could believe that. lf you go along with us, l'll prove it to you.
Look, you're the only one that can help us. l'll tell you what.
You scratch my back, and l'll scratch yours.
Make bigger circles.
Mmm, bigger, Rick.
Mr. Kohana!
Mr. Kohana!
Shh!
Quick, quick, we've got to get to the plane.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Uh, you've brought me to the wrong convention is what's the matter.
We're even on the wrong island.
Wrong convention?
This is a convention of the SPCA-- the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to...
Alligators.
Oh, quick.
We've got to get out of here.
They're liable to lynch me. l'm supposed to be at the Hanalei Plantation.
But you said the Maui Sheraton.
Well, l'm a stranger around here.
How am l supposed to know where l'm going?
That's the reason l hired you.
No, you.
Okay, Mr. Cubberson.
Let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Hey, that's great. l know another girl at the Hanalei Plantation.
She can do us a lot of good, too.
Spare me, will you,
Rick, buddy?
You're wasting your time.
Don't bet on it.
Come on, come on. l'll talk to you later, Lehua.
Oh... Oh, well, l'm here in plenty of time. l'd like to settle up and buy you boys a drink? l'll take a rain check, Mr. Cubberson.
But don't forget us on your next trip.
Oh, no, l won't. l'll see you later, Danny.
Aren't you forgetting something,
Mr. Cubberson?
Huh?
Oh.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, Rick!
Rick, welcome home! l'm glad to be back, Lani. l thought you were dead, or worse, married.
Well, l had a few crash landings but l managed to walk away.
What's new in your life?
Just an absence of you.
Come on.
Oh, where you taking me?
Down to the Piki Niki. ln case you've forgotten, l work here. ls Charlie running, or do we walk?
Well, he's still temperamental, but let's risk it.
Tell me you came back to see me, Rick.
Go ahead, lie a little.
Well, the truth is l'm trying to start a helicopter service with Danny Kohana.
We could fly people to out-of-the-way places like Moonlight Beach.
Rick, you remembered!
Sure. lt was a long walk, but it was worth it.
Three days of absolute heaven.
When can we go again?
Well, until l get this business started l'm going to be pretty busy, but there is a way.
What's that?
Well, you could recommend our service to the hotel guests, and l can combine work with the pleasure of seeing you.
And l'd be helping you get your business started, right? ln a way like nobody else could.
You scratch my back and l'll scratch yours.
Huh? What about it?
Start scratching.
And here she is, and none too soon--
Hanalei's own Lani Kaimana.
One good turn deserves another
Be my love, l'll be your lover lt's all part of nature's laws
Ooba do-bop, do-bop lf you scratch my back
Ooba do-bop, do-bop
Then l'll scratch yours
Ooba do-bop, a-dooba do-bop lf you'll scratch-a my back
Then l scratch-a your back
Like two peas in a pack
Let's get rid of our itch together
Joy, they say, is in the givin'
Come on, give, make life worth livin'
Your welfare is my concern
Dooba do-bop, do-bop
Do a favor for me
Dooba do-bop, do-bop l'll do one in return
Dooba do-bop, a-dooba, do-bop lf you'll scratch-a my back
Then l'll scratch-a your back
Like two peas in a pack
Let's get rid of our itch together, hmm
Scratch me now, a little lower
What a feeling, do it slower
[ Skipped item nr. 467 ]
Well, l gotta admit
Dooba, do-bop, do-bop
You just hit the spot
Dooba, do-bop, dooba, do-bop lf you'll scratch-a my back
Then l'll scratch-a your back
Like two peas in a pack
Let's get rid of our itch together lf you scratch-a my back
Then l'll scratch-a your back
Like two peas in a pack
Let's get rid of our itch together.
Hey, Danny, Blackmont won't wait much longer. l mean, where would we be if Captain Cook hadn't taken a chance?
You'd probably be in a stew pot and my people would still own the islands.
Look, we're missing a chance of a lifetime. lt could work just great with Lani and Lehua sending us customers and there'll be more.
Okay. l borrowed all the cash l possibly could but l still can't make it without you. l said okay.
And if l don't pay it back, l'll be in hock up to my neck.
That should show how serious l am about this thing.
You said okay? l did.
That means you'll go? l already made up my mind.
Lani called about a couple of firm deals and Lehua called asking about prices. l may be a little pupule, but... shake, partner.
''Danrick.'' Dan, Rick.
Thanks for the billing.
Well, we're in business now.
Hey, but, uh, what's the lineup?
Don't tell me we've got customers already.
Well, uh, not exactly.
We need somebody to mind the place while we're out so l advertised for a Girl Friday.
You sure it's not a little something for Saturday and Sunday?
All right, girls.
Follow me inside and... l'll check out your qualifications. lt's a good thing she doesn't have a portable television.
Where did you put the ad, in ''Playboy''?
This way, girls.
Hi, Danny.
Judy, what are you doing? l told Ben this is the last time l'd rent this plane if he didn't get the rudder cable fixed.
You practicing for the powder-puff derby?
Ha! My mom won that when she was nothing but a bored housewife.
Anyway, l've had it for a while. l'm running too low on cash to rent planes anymore.
Judy, how would you like to work for me?
As a pilot?
A pilot?!
Why not?
Women can set all kinds of records but not one of you will let us make a living flying.
Well, maybe we can talk about that later.
Ever work in an office?
Where do you think l get the money to sink into flying? l've outrun some of the biggest executives in Honolulu!
Did you bring a change of clothes?
Sure. Why?
Don't ask any questions.
Just get cleaned up.
Here. l'll explain it later.
Well, thanks a lot, girls and we'll get in touch with you later on.
Thank you.
Thank you.
-Good-bye.
-Bye.
Well, your qualifications look good.
How's your typing? l hunt and peck.
Yeah, l'll bet you do.
You sit over at my desk and l'll be with you in a minute.
How's your shorthand? l take 180 words per minute. l also operate a tabulating machine translate Hawaiian and Japanese and l'm quite good with a scalp massage.
Yeah, uh, well, you sit right over here and my partner will talk to you in a few minutes.
How are you at answering the phone?
Depends on what l'm doing when you call.
Well, you wait here, and l'll interview you.
Hey, Rick, can l see you out here for a minute?
Don't go away, girls.
Look, you can let them all go. l've hired the perfect girl.
She can type, take shorthand and knows the islands.
Huh... We met before, about two years ago.
On a surfboard.
Really?
Yeah, Waikiki.
You were wiped out.
Remember? l scooped you out of the soup.
Oh, yeah, l remember.
You tried to give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
The offer still holds.
Hmm, l'll keep it in mind.
You never gave me your name.
Judy...
Uh, Mrs. Hudson.
Oh. Mrs. Rock Hudson?
Uh, Mrs. Roy Hudson.
Julie's husband's a Navy pilot.
He's out on maneuvers.
Oh. Do you mind if l call you ''Friday''?
Uh, Judy reminds me of a clam shucker.
A clam shucker?
Yeah, it's this girl l used to know. lt was her favorite pastime-- shucking clams.
Would you excuse us, please?
Danny?
Why pick a married one?
So you'd keep your mind on your work.
Ah, you worry too much, Danny. l'm off to forge another link in the Danrick operation.
There's a girl at the
Polynesian Culture Center...
Oh, not another one.
Look, we've got enough gals working for us now to start a modeling agency.
The more girls, the more business. l promise l won't get emotionally involved.
Take the other girls inside, will you?
And get their numbers while you're at it. l'll buy one of my own at the dime store.
Sometimes saying you're married works better than an insect repellent.
Hi, Rick.
Hi.
Please excuse me.
Rick, aloha noe!
Pua, it's been a long time.
Too long. l've missed you.
Where did you get the helicopter? l've just gone into business with Danny Kohana.
Then you're going to stay on the islands?
Once l get the helicopter service going l can spend most of my time here.
Oh, l'm for that!
Can l help?
Like nobody else can.
You scratch my back, and l'll scratch yours.
Sounds good.
Oh, but right now l've got to ride on a canoe. lt's part of the show.
Do you want to come along?
Great! Let's go!
Okay.
Drums of the islands, you're beating in my heart
You're with me no matter where l roam lf ever l wander, if ever we're apart l know that you will lead me home lf l should journey across the deep blue sea l'll never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands, l hear you calling me
And l'll return forever yours l love each valley, each grain of sand, each hill
The flowers, the music of the isles
These are the things that l love and always will
Though l may roam
10,000 miles
Drums of the islands, you're beating in my heart

Danrick Airways. l'm sorry, he's not here right now.
Yes, l will.
Oh, how's it going?
Danny was looking for you.
He had to leave with a customer.
What's up?
You've got a date with some dogs.
Oh, a change of pace, eh? l meant real ones.
A Mrs. Daisy Barrington chartered our service to take her pets to a dog show in Kauai.
Nobody else would take them uncrated.
She'll meet you at the country club.
We don't haul dogs.
She's willing to pay a great deal.
Oh. We do haul dogs.
Uh, where are they?
You're to pick them up at the Kahala Hilton.
Like right now.
The Kahala Hilton.
That reminds me, l know a girl who works there.
Might be able to help us.
Another clam shucker?
Very funny.
Oh, uh, by the way, how do you like the job? l'd rather be doing what you're doing. l don't think you could take the strain.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Mm. l sure like the way you working girls don't dress. lt's my day off and l can dress any way l like.
Are those your dogs?
Well, it's time for you to go to work.
Hmm. What a way to earn a living. lt's nice of you to come along, Joanna. l want to see what l'm selling.
Thank you.
We'll get them there all right. lf l had my life to live over, l know just what l'd like to be
A pampered pet of a rich brunette
Sittin' on my mama's knee
Someone to love me, someone to care
Rubba-dubba-dub her little fingers through my hair l need a dog's life
What a life
That's good enough for me
That's good enough for me lf l had a bone to be pickin'
A pickin' chicken or a steak
Curled up there in an easy chair
Man, that won't be hard to take l'll always be faithful
That's what l'd be
Never bite the hand that feeds me, no, sirree
Just lead a dog's life
What a life
That's good enough for me
That's good enough for me l'd find me a fifi le poodle
And lose my noodle over her l'd chase her around
All over town
Just to ruffle up her fur
Nuzzle her muzzle, a hole in her paw
Greatest case of puppy lovin' you ever saw lt's called a dog's life
What a life
That's good enough for me
You heard me say it now
That's good enough for me
Yeah.
That's good enough for me.
Ah, behave yourself.
This evening had better be worth what l'm going through back here. l'll buy you the biggest steak you ever had.
Okay, all right, you cats, cool it!
Hey, l'm your friend.
They must be hungry.
Behave yourself.
Ow! You don't eat out much, do you?
Here. You take them and see if you can calm them down.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, get them off me!
Help me!
Help!
Down, boy.
Down, l said. Not up!
Rick!
Rick!
Hey!
He's blocking my view.
Get him off my lap!
Rick, watch what you're doing!
Joanna, hold him back.
Hey, you want to fly it? l can't see! Rick!
Yeah, l see it!
Help!
Oh, my God, help!
Rick, Rick, Rick, stop!
Rick, the car!
Donald!
You, you, you... road hog!
There ought to be a law against such an outrage! l got his number.
This is the day, Ruggles.
The is the big day we've been waiting for.
At last, at last. lt's their first flight without me.
They're growing up.
Oh, Ruggles, l hope to heaven my little ones didn't get airsick.
My babies.
My babies.
My babies!
What have they done to you?!
Look at them.
Just look at them.
How can l ever show them?!
What have you done to my precious babies?!
Well, look what they've done to me.
Shh-shh!
Well, they're just fine, ma'am.
See, we had a little party on the way over... with dancing and music... and doggie yum-yums.
You fed them dog food?
How dare...!
Oh... did that naughty man hurt
Mommy's little sweethearts?
Oh, well, you come on with Mommy.
Mommy take care of you.
Come on, Ruggles.
Come on, baby.
Mommy take care of you. l look a lot worse than they do.
Yeah. How am l going to show you?
By paying for a new hairdo.
And that steak you promised.
Stop it, Andy.
Behave yourself.
You're making me lose my appetite.
Oh, well, l'm improving mine. l was told you were shy and retiring.
You must have been talking to my mother. l'm starved.
All l've had all day were those doggie yum-yums.
My hairdresser almost gave up.
She thought l should be declared a disaster area. l don't know about that.
Stop it! l'll have a thick slice of that one.
Uh, new rules: no dogs, alligators or cats.
Just give us two fillets.
You, uh, lose your wedding ring?
Oh, l always take it off when l bathe.
Oh, you've taken a bath.
Uh, Joanna, this is my secretary, Mrs. Hudson.
Oh, hello.
Hi. Well, it's been nice seeing you.
Come on, Andy.
The table's ready. l haven't ordered my steak yet. l've ordered enough for two-- come on!
Oh, l didn't know your husband was back from maneuvers.
Rick Richards.
Give me a big hunk of that, mac.
Husband?!
Uh, well, this isn't my husband.
He's a friend-- a friend of ours.
Baby, l didn't know you were married. l'm sorry, l've done a terrible thing and l can understand you hating me.
But l don't hate you. l think it's great.
Stop it. l told you, l'm married.
Yeah, l know.
Maybe you better cool it, huh?
Hey, why don't you stick that big nose somewhere else, buster?
Cut it out.
Just chalk it off to experience.
Now, look, l ain't leaving until l get my steak.
Baby, we could have a good time...
Here's your steak... rare!
One of those, huh?
That's my boy.
Dust him off, Rusty.
Duck, Rick!
You... you...!
Joanna!
Get me out of here.
Would you like your steaks put in a doggie bag, sir?
A doggie bag!
After what l've been through?
You're quite a girl, Friday: surfer, pilot, secretary, wife.
Well, yes, sometimes l amaze myself. l'll see you in the morning?
Why not? l haven't been fired, have l?
No, your personal life's your own. l'm sorry l got involved in it tonight.
You can let me off here. lt's only another block.
For the same fare, l could take you all the way.
Good night, Rick.
Uh, maybe l better go and explain to your husband that you had to work late.
Uh, no, thanks.
And that you'll be leaving early on a special assignment.
-For the company?
-Of course.
But maybe it's better if l tell him about it.
No, he wouldn't understand.
He's very jealous.
Well, that didn't bother you earlier.
Which makes me just the kind of girl you like, doesn't it?
Good night.
Aw, come on, you can't be that angry.
Can't l? l was afraid you might not show up this morning but l'm glad you did.
Thank you.
There's still something wrong.
That bugs you, doesn't it?
No, it's just good business.
A single girl sells more tickets. l'll keep it.
Where? lt's a good thing you weren't wearing a charm bracelet.
That's it.
Hold it.
B-But, Mr. Belden are you sure it was one of our helicopters?
Yes, yes, that's right.
Not now, Jan.
Friday?
He did what?!
Mr. Belden, why would anyone be driving down either side of the highway, let alone the wrong side?
Look, Kohana, l'm accustomed to handling complaints filed by others and l hate to make more work for myself and the board but l can not ignore reckless flying and the near-destruction of government property in the form of my assigned automobile not to mention my wife.
Your wife? l hope it wasn't serious.
What happened?
Oh, hi, Uncle Rick!
Oh, hi, Jan. l guess l'm getting too old for that stuff.
No, you got a long way to go,
Jan.
What are you doing here?
Daddy promised me a ride in his helicopter!
Shh...
And then we're going for a swim.
Hmm.
Now there's no point in making a federal case out of it as long as no one was seriously hurt.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, l'll come right over and see if we can't straighten it out.
Yes, sir, right away.
Do you know who that was?
Surprise me.
Donald Belden.
One of the regional directors of the lsland Aviation Bureau.
Where does he want us to fly him?
He's already been given a short trip-- right into an irrigation ditch.
You forced him off the highway with the chopper. l what?!
He says his wife will never be the same.
Are you sure he doesn't want to thank me?
Oh, come on.
This is no time for jokes. l've got to go right over and calm him down before he files a formal complaint.
Look, Danny, l didn't even see him. lt must've happened when the dogs got loose.
You really set some kind of a new record. ln addition to Belden we've had complaints from Mrs. Barrington the Steak House and the
Pineapple Pickers Union.
Oh, boy.
Good news travels fast, doesn't it? l'll see you all later. l got to go bail us out, one at a time.
But Dad, you said you were going to go take me for a ride. l did it, Danny. l'll clear it up.
Let me talk to Belden.
No chance.
You couldn't get near him. l'm sorry, sweetheart.
Maybe later.
You keep an eye on her until l get back.
Come on, honey, l'll teach you how to type your name. l already know that.
Oh, you had two calls.
Business or pleasure? l'm beginning to wonder if there's a difference.
Uh, Joanna wants you to call her and Lani has a honeymoon couple on Kauai who want to come back here to the airport.
Cheer up, Jan.
He'll be back soon.
Why do grownups always think business is so important?
Nothing is more important than you are.
Your daddy just has to straighten out a mess l got us into.
Now what if l take you up?
Would you, Uncle Rick?
Why not?
Right near the hotel on Kauai is a place called the lron Kettle where they have the most beautiful beach and they build the biggest sand castles you ever saw.
How about it?
That sounds great.
Let's go.
That's nice of you, but you think you should?
Sure, why not?
We'll have lunch at Hanalei and then bring the passengers back after that. lt'll be like a real date!
Hmm... my life gets more and more complicated.
Let's go.
And remember: no dogs, alligators or cats.
And you keep off the highways.
Bye, Friday!
Fun, huh? lt's like being inside a big glass bug. l'll teach you how to fly this bug when you're old enough.
Do you really think l could?
Sure, there's nothing to it.
All you have to do is learn how to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time.
That's great.
Now try blinking one eye.
Now stick out your tongue.
Oh, that's just being silly.
Well, that's what dates are for.
Datin' is a game that grown-ups play
Datin' means actin' in a silly way
Datin' makes the gals start wiggle walkin'
Datin' makes a guy start baby-talkin'
Dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
Grown-ups are the biggest kids l've found
You'd think they'd belong in a baby carriage
They're doin' things that lead to marriage
Now, don't you laugh at what they do, oh, no
'Cause someday you'll be datin', too
Datin' makes a guy comb his hair just right
So his gal can mess it up when they kiss good night
Datin' makes you quarrel and say you'll break up
Just because it's so much fun to make up
Children can't wait to grow up, but then...
They're datin' and they're actin' like kids again
You'd think they'd belong in a baby carriage
But they're doin' things that lead to marriage
Now, don't you laugh at what they do, oh, no
Someday you'll be datin' too
Oh, boy! Sandcastles!
Welcome, Rick.
Thank you.
You've come back to marry my daughter?
Papa, please.
She has royal blood.
On her mother's side?
My ancestors had the right idea. lf a young man didn't want to marry your daughter you dipped him in coconut butter and threw him into a volcano. ln coconut butter?
They use it on everything.
You think it over, Rick. l got some other cooking to do.
Well, uh, l better get back to the hotel.
The honeymooners will be waiting.
Oh, they won't be ready until 4:00.
4:00? That's five hours from now.
Wasn't that the point to our deal-- to spend a little time together? l've got Jan with me.
You can have her back before dark.
We'll leave her here with Papa and go to Moonlight Beach.
No deal. l can't leave Jan. l promised not to let her out of my sight.
All right, but it won't be the same. l'll get my swimsuit and meet you at the 'copter... with three lunches.
Uncle Rick!
Uncle Rick, come help us build a sand castle.
A house of sand is an empty work of art
Oh, you can take a whole lot of sand
And build a castle on the beach
And though you mold it, and you plan
Still you've got nothing in your reach
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love that's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
A house of sand is an empty work of art
Oh, you can build a tower of clay
But if you ask my advice
Well, it's worthless, l say lt's got no heart, it's cold as ice
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love
That's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art
A house of sand is an empty work of art
A house of sand is an empty work of art.
Oh, it's just beautiful!
Just beautiful!
You sure you're going to make it?
Yeah, l'm sure.
You made it!
Just like a roller-coaster. lt was scary.
Well, what do you say we go for a swim?
Now... last one out of the water is a papaya picker!
Uncle Rick, l don't care if l am a papaya picker.
You're the prettiest little papaya picker l've ever seen.
Boy, this is a neat place. l could stay here forever.
So could l, ''Uncle Rick.''
Uh, we can't stay long. l've got some business to take care of.
Aren't l part of that business?
You're more pleasure than business.
Well, prove it.
There's a third party at this convention, you know.
Well, she could go bird- watching, or something. lt's getting late.
Time to go.
Let's pack up.
Party pooper!
You'd better go wash that sand off.
You all packed?
We're all ready, Rick.
Come on.
Oh, no!
All right, Lani, where is it?
Where is what?
The key.
How would l know?
This is no time for games.
We can't stay any longer.
Okay, l'll make a deal with you. l'm listening. l'd like your complete attention.
You got 15 seconds.
You want to renegotiate? l'd like to, but l think my mainspring's busted.
Now, about that key.
Where'd you learn a trick like that?
From you.
Don't you remember?
You ''lost'' the key to your car the first night we met.
That's how we got stranded at Waimea Lookout.
Well, where is it? l threw it over there.
You threw it?!
Hey, Uncle Rick, what are you doing digging for sand crabs?
Not exactly.
We're playing a game called ''one of our keys is missing.''
Oh, gee, can l play, too?
Why not?
First one to find it gets a great big kiss.
Aw, heck, l'd rather have a hot fudge sundae.
Look, Rick, l'll explain that it all happened because of me. l don't think that'll help. l wonder if they've dropped the death penalty for kidnapping.
Daddy won't be mad,
Uncle Rick.
He knows l'm with you.
Sure.
Hey, you shovel for a while.
Jan, you better get dressed.
How did it go?
What a mess. l straightened everything out except Belden.
He's already filed a formal complaint.
We could lose our charter to operate.
What are you doing here so late?
Waiting for Rick and Jan.
Where did they go?
Rick took Jan with him to Kauai on a job but that was hours ago. l phoned the hotel, but they said he'd left there... with three picnic lunches.
Three?!
Maybe he picked up a playmate for Jan.
Yeah, sure.
A playmate named Lani.
Some playmate.
What time did they leave there?
This morning.
MGA six-seven-zero calling helicopter two-zero-two.
Rick, this is base.
Can you hear me? Over.
[ Skipped item nr. 1157 ] l'm sure of it.
She'd better be.
Where are you going?
The last time he was with Lani they spent three days at Moonlight Beach. lt was their favorite hideaway.
But he wouldn't go there with Jan along, would he?
Wouldn't he?
Sometimes he seems so nice.
You're married, remember?
You stick by the phone. l'm going to try to find them.
Stay clear of the blades.
Hey, why don't we build a signal fire with driftwood like they say in the Brownies? lt's a good idea.
We'll rest awhile, and if no one sees us then we'll, uh, then we'll start walking.
Let's get some driftwood.
Hey, Uncle Rick, they say in the Brownies that seaweed makes more smoke.
Want to put some seaweed on it?
Sure. Why not?
Whew!
What would we do without the Brownies?
Uncle Rick, look!
Hey, it must be Daddy.
He's come to rescue us.
Yeah, l think l'm going to need rescuing after he gets here.
Daddy! Daddy!
Are you all right, honey?
Oh, l'm fine.
We had a wonderful time.
We went on a picnic, we got marooned we lost the key and then we built a big signal fire.
Listen, you can tell me all about it later, Jan.
Now you just get inside. l've got to get you home.
Your mother's worried about you.
Danny... l can explain the whole thing to you.
Oh, l bet you can.
Go ahead.
We were stranded... marooned. l lost the key.
Aw, come on.
That gag was old when you first started using it ten years ago.
But it wasn't his fault-- l lost the key.
Oh, sure you did. l must have been crazy to think l could go into business with you.
We were booked solid today and your little stunt cost us every passenger not to mention keeping
Jan out all night and scaring us half to death.
We thought you were spread out all over some mountain.
Calm down, Danny. l'm telling the truth.
We lost the key, we spent the whole night looking for it.
Save it. You can bring the chopper back in but you and l are through.
Our partnership's dissolved.
Good-bye, Uncle Rick. lt was a wonderful picnic.
Yeah.
A registered letter for Mr. Richards. l'll take it.
Thank you. l'm glad you're back, but where are Danny and Jan?
Aren't they back yet?
Danny called Betty--
Jan's all right.
He was refueling at Hanalei, but that was quite a while ago.
Ah, he flies that thing like an old lady from Pasadena.
Oh, this just came for you. l was glad to know you hadn't crashed.
That's a matter of opinion.
Going somewhere?
Danny thinks he can get along better without me so let him settle up with Blackmont any way he wants to.
And that evens up the score.
That's life, fun and games.
Too bad Danny didn't realize that before he put himself into hock for all this.
That's his problem. l got my own to worry about.
Has there ever been anyone but you, really? l mean, have you ever cared about anything or anybody without thinking what they could do for you? l tried to explain to him it wasn't my fault, but he wouldn't listen. l think you're more to blame for what happens to you than you're willing to admit. l think you're bitter and arrogant and-and just plain selfish.
Danrick Airways.
Oh, hi, Betty.
No. No, not yet. l-l'm sure they're all right.
Rick just came back.
You sit tight. l'll ring you the minute they get here.
Where could they be?
They should've been back here long before this.
There's nothing l can do about it.
Belden's had me grounded for 30 days.
Rick... l'm sorry, l didn't know.
Forget it.
Somebody has to find them.
You better notify the authorities.
That'll take too long. l'm going in the plane.
Hey, Friday.
Wait a minute. lf they're down, you'll never get there in a plane.
We'd better take the chopper.
But if you fly, they'll revoke your license for good.
Well, that's a chance l'll have to take.
Would they go this way? lt's the shortest route home.
The only place to land around here is that stretch of beach.
Rick, over there to the left.
Uncle Rick! Uncle Rick!
You all right, Jan?
Yes, but Daddy's hurt.
Where is he?
-He's over there.
-Let's go.
Hey, Rick!
You wait right here.
Rick!
Mountain climbing again, native? l tried to check the damage to the rotor blade. l slipped and fell. l think my leg's broken.
Hey, Rick!
What can l do to help?
Get the first aid kit out of the chopper.
Why didn't you radio? lt conked out when we came down. l tried to set her down easy, but without power l couldn't move away from the ledge. l'm going to get you fixed up.
Hold it. Easy.
Take it real easy.
Take Jan back to the chopper and wait there.
He'll be all right now, Jan.
We didn't have first aid in the Brownies yet. l know, honey.
You did very well.
But l lit the flares.
All by yourself?
Daddy showed me how. lt's real easy. ls it? l never lit one.
Well, you see, you just pull the paper off the end and strike it like a match. lt's a lot easier than building a fire.
Mm, sounds like it. l wonder if the Brownies know about flares?
Watch it.
Come on, attaboy.
All right, what happened?
You wouldn't believe it just like l didn't believe you.
Don't tell me you lost your key.
Worse than that.
After we left you we stopped at the plantation to call Betty and gas up.
Then we took off again.
15 minutes later, l was in trouble. l was so upset, l forgot to fill her up. l stopped using that gag
15 years ago.
You think she'll stay there?
She'll stay there until l get help to move her.
But remember one thing.
Yeah, what's that?
That's your chopper.
Let's go.
Thank you, nurse. l'll be back.
Another contact?
Well, you never know.
She could send us some customers.
You know, like, uh, people with broken legs.
How do you feel, Danny?
Ooh, l can't kick.
Very funny.
What about the chopper?
Well, l ordered the parts.
We should be able to fly her out of there in a few days.
A lot of good that'll do us, huh?
With me in that cast and you still grounded.
What's happening with the board?
When are they going to make their ruling?
Next week.
And with my record they'll never let me near an airplane again.
But it was an emergency.
Yeah, but they got rules and they don't like to see them broken. lf l could just talk to Belden.
But he won't even see me.
He's going to be guest of honor at the Polynesian
Welcoming Festival.
Yeah? When's that?
Saturday.
But you won't be able to talk to him there.
Why not? lt's a big affair, top entertainment.
Hey, Jan's going to sing. lf l can't get Belden to listen to reason, we've had it. l told you before, you won't be able to get near him.
Look, why don't we forget the whole thing and open up a pizza parlor, huh?
Any of those girls ltalian?
Now you're starting to sound like me.
Polynesian Welcoming Festival.
Oh, won't you come home
Bill Bailey?
Come on home
She moaned the whole day long l'll do the cookin', honey l'll pay the rent l know l done you wrong
Ah, yes, indeed, ah
Remember that rainy evening l put you out
With nothin', oh, nothin' but a fine-tooth comb?
You see, l know l'm to blame
Well, now, ain't it a shame?
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?
Won't you come home,
Bill Bailey?
Will you please come on home?
This woman moaned and groaned l'm telling you, a-moaning and a-groaning
The whole day long, she said l'll do the cooking, honey l'll pay the rent l know l done you wrong
Yes, indeed, ah
Remember that rainy evening l a-put you out
With nothing, oh, nothing, but a fine-tooth comb?
You see l know l'm to blame
Well, now ain't it a shame?
Ah, Bill Bailey, won't you please come ho-o-o-ome?
Now, now, now, now, Bill Bailey
Won't you please come home?
Oh, you were fine, honey.
Just fine.
Everybody else seems to think so, too.
Sounds like they want more.
First rule of show business:
Always leave them wanting more, right, Uncle Rick?
Right.
You were great, Jan.
Thanks. l'm hungry!
-Me, too.
-Me, too.
You having a good time?
Oh, yeah.
Relax, they said Belden wouldn't be here till later.
You might as well enjoy yourself in the meantime.
Oh, well, l am.
But only because you decided to come along and l promise your husband will never know.
Rick, there's something l think you have the right to know. l want you to know...
Uh... let's dance, huh?
What about our food?
Well, l-l-l'm not hungry.
We'll work up an appetite.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?!
Oh, oh, l'm sorry, what were you saying?
Nothing, nothing at all. lt wasn't important.
Why did you stop?
We were just starting. l-l-l'll explain it to you later.
What's the matter? l think l better wait for Belden outside. Look.
Pua and Lehua?
Yeah, they're all here.
So? l told you everybody on the island would be here.
Oh, no!
Stop...
Where you are
Don't move an inch
Don't come any closer now, baby
You'll be in a pinch
Don't start what you can't finish l warn you what's in store lf it's love you're looking to get
You're gonna get what you're looking for
Stop...
Where you are
You'd better freeze
Don't fool with fire now, baby
Don't be a tease
Don't start what you can't finish l told you once before lf it's love you're lookin' to get
You're gonna get what you're lookin' for
Don't you know
You're walkin' on dangerous ground
Listen, babe, when l make love l just don't fool around, no, l don't l just don't play around
Stop...
Where you are
Just take it slow
Once l put my hands on you, baby l won't let you go
Don't start what you can't finish
One kiss and l want more lf it's love you're lookin' to get
You're gonna get what you're lookin' for
Stop...
Where you are
Don't move an inch
Stop...
Where you are
You're gonna be in a pinch
Stop...
Where you are
You're gonna get what you're looking for
Bop-bop, bah
Bop-bop, ba-dah, bop
Bop-bop, bah, ba-dop.
Gee, that was swell,
Uncle Rick. l'll just look outside for Belden.
But you haven't eaten.
Who can eat?
There's a storm brewing and l got to get out of here before it hits.
Oops, too late. lt just hit.
No wonder you're too busy to come see me.
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Hi, Jan.
Hi, Lani.
When are we going on another picnic?
Well, it looks like we're on one right now, honey. l didn't know you girls knew Rick.
Apparently he went right through the sorority.
What loyalty. l wonder if he got to our house mother?
Uh... if you'll excuse me, l was just leaving. l've got business to settle with you first.
That has a familiar ring.
Don't tell me you've been sending him customers, too.
Look, ladies, l can explain the whole thing.
Well, how'd he hook you in this deal?
''You scratch my back and l'll scratch yours.''
Oh... ls this any way to run an airline? l have every intention of paying you for the services rendered.
Wouldn't that be spreading yourself a little thin? l'd like to make it up to you if you'll just give me a chance. l-l'll put it on a cash basis.
A percentage of all the business you book for us.
A percentage? ln writing? ln writing.
Do you think we can trust him?
Well, l guess it couldn't hurt.
Any more than it already has.
Okay, for money, l'll swallow my pride.
And if he doesn't come through we'll boil him in coconut butter.
Been nice doing business with you all. l think my date's getting cold.
Bye, girls. l'll check with you later.
That's quite a harem.
Well, look, uh, l may have made some promises but that's as far as it went.
You're pretty free with your promises.
How you going to keep that last one? l'll tell you after l talk to Belden.
Good luck, Rick.
The performance is about to begin in the amphitheater.
Now look, l agreed to the pancake or whatever it is but the lipstick is out.
But, sir, it's necessary for the television camera.
Those are my orders.
No lipstick.
-Mr. Belden.
-Yes.
Congratulations, sir.
Oh, thank you. l realize this is an honor but they're making me feel like an actor.
Who are you?
Have we met?
Oh, well, sort of-- l-l know this is not the time or the place to discuss business, but... l make it a rule never to discuss business outside my office.
Well, you wouldn't see me at your office, sir.
And this is an emergency. l'm Rick Richards.
Rick Richards?
Oh, you're the one responsible for my wife not being here.
She threw her back out when you ran us off the road. lf you'll just listen,
Mr. Belden. lf l don't get my license reinstated l'm in real trouble.
My partner, Danny Kohana, hocked everything to go into business with me and now he's laid up with a broken leg. l know all about the rescue.
We're not trying to run you out of business and we're not unfairly rigid in our interpretation of the law.
We realize, occasionally there are mitigating circumstances.
Then l-l'll get my license back?
Oh, when the board meets next week l'll make the recommendation. lf a man risks his entire future to save a friend he can't be all bad.
Well, thank you,
Mr. Belden. Thank you.
Besides... this is the first time l've been able to get out without my wife in years. l think l like it.
Thanks again, Mr. Belden.
By George, l think he did it.
He did.
We're back in business.
All you need to do is get rid of that concrete cowboy boot. l'd like to talk to you, Mrs. Hudson.
Well, Rick, there's something l've got to explain to you about Friday.
Danny, l can spot a single girl with my eyes closed-- strictly on instruments.
Excuse us, pal.
You knew all along?
There's some things you just can't hide.
Why didn't you say something? l didn't want to spoil your fun... and mine.
Oh, no!
This is my heaven
Being here with you
Make it last forever
This is my heaven lt's a dream come true
Make it last forever
Here 'neath the sky
Beside the sea
This is my heaven
When you
Come to me

Hawaii, USA!
Gentlemen? Gentlemen, it's quite true.
The weather continues to defy nature.
Overnight the temperatureat the Arctic has risen 4.9°F.
Gentlemen! Another five degrees...
...and Haifa Harbour is completely under water!
It's true. New York, San
Francisco, NewOrleans,
Marseilles - every port's in danger.
Who is doing this? And why?
- It's the work of madmen.
Mad, sane...
They're brilliant.
They're demonstrating thatthey can control the weather!
Turn wheat belts into deserts, put icebergs in the Mediterranean.
Control the weather, you control the world. - What do they want?
Why haven't they contacted us? - Oh, they will.
But we're not going to wait for them. We've just had our first break.
According to this dispatch I just received, our team of agents has them cornered!
At any second...
It was a trap.
We just lost another team of agents.
They know every move we make! - They have a superb intelligence unit.
How can I find that laboratoryif
I keep losing manpower?
How about 0008? - Unfortunately he is not available.
International narcotics. -
Please. We can't use 0008.
They have a file on all our personnel. Wehave...
...to recruit from outside the organisation.
Well, ifyou'll write down the qualificationsyou believe necessary for the assignment, our computer'll give us the ideal man.
Stand by computers.
Derek Flint! My country awarded himthe Croix de Guerre!
Flint's wrong for this job. - Wasn't he under your command in the war?
Forget it. He can't take orders. - Derek
Flint! Three promotions in a month!
And our Medal of Honor. - I said forget it!
Excellent chap, expert frogman. Name's Derek Flint.
We need a man who can follow regulations!
We need a man who's disciplined!
Flint.
I don't care what these computers say. I know this man. He just...
Yes, sir?
Yeah? Well, uh...
Well, how did you know, sir?
Very well, sir.
Yes, sir. Well, of course, that's your privilege, sir.
Well, ifthat's your wish.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.
Very well, gentlemen, uh... Derek Flint.
Mr Cramden wants...
Mr Flint? General Hawkins.
Mr Cramden wants...
What do you mean, he said no? I sent you...
Yes, sir?
But I sent General Hawkins himself, sir.
Yes, sir. I'll contact Flint personally.
Yes, sir. It'll be a pleasure, sir.
Sir?
Flint...
Lower your hand slowly and smile.
What? - If he senses hostility, he'll rip you apart.
Smile, sir.
Thank you, Caesar.
Well, sir, this is a surprise.
Let me take your hat and coat.
Perhaps nudes aren't your dish oftea.
Have a cigar, sir.
No, thank you.
Breakfast, sir?
I had lunch two hours ago. - Oh,
I must still be on Moscow time.
Moscow? Business? - No. Ballet, sir.
You travelled to Moscow to watch a ballet? - No, to teach.
Do you mind ifwe talk while I shave? - After you.
Flint, I'm here because...-
You want something.
Don't be clever. I came here on orders. - Bonjour, cheri.
Bonjour, baby.
Maybe my office is a better place to talk...- I doubt it, sir.
Well, once you realise the importanceofthis project, I know you'll be interested...
You know the high regard I havefor you and your organisation.
Thank you. - But I think your file on me needs updating.
You see, as of late my interestsare less governmental than personal.
All right for today?
Excellent, carissima.
Later.
Now, Flint, in the pastyou and
I have had our differences of...
Well, discipline is a vital factor...
...that every citizen has got...
Don't wave the flag in the bathroom. Just come to the point.
Excuse me.
Flint, the government needs you.
Yes, well, it's good to be wanted, sir.
This is the most important assignmentever offered!
I hope you find a good man for your project.
Ohayo gozaimasu, Derek.
- Ohayo gozaimasu, honey.
Man does not live by bread alone.
Later.
Now, Flint, every computer designated youthe best man for the job.
That must have pleased you. -
Look, I don't bear a grudge.
I know we've had our disagreements...-
Sir, you know it doesn't work between us.
Later, baby.
Do you want a shave, sir? -
Flint, the world's in trouble!
It usually is, but it managesto extricate itselfwithout my help.
You're still the same old selfish, arrogant...!
Sir, you're getting edgy. - Don't tell me...!
Later!
Yeah?
But l...
Good evening, Monsieur Flint.
Paul, table number one.
Thank you, Maurice. - The pleasure is mine, Monsieur Flint. Merci.
Stand back, folks. Please stand back. Give the man some air. Thank you very much.
Give me that candle.
Why would anyone want to kill Mr Cramden?
I think that dart was meant for me.
It seems I have ajobwhether
I want one or not.
Gentlemen, the new head of ouroperations team, the man you selected,
Derek Flint.
Thank you, gentlemen. I accept this assignment.
Oh, I'm sorry about that crude incision, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen. We'll now have a private briefing.
I owe you my life. The medics said four more seconds...
Three, sir. - Dammit, is there anything you don't know?
A great many things, sir.
Now, ifyou'll excuse me, I'll need a few hours to prepare.
It worries me when he stops his heart.
It's over three hours, isn't it?
Yes, but it does relax him.
Must be a dangerous assignment.
Ladies.
Sakito?
You call Eddie and confirmour seats for the concert.
Gina?
Venison's almost ready to be hung. You'll take care of it?
Leslie.
Call Freddie and postpone my fitting. - Till when?
Wednesday will be all right. - Are you sure?
Of course.
Your code book. - Ifyou don't mind, I'll use my own code.
I'd rather you used this. - Mine's a mathematical progression.
40, 26, 36. It's based on...- I can imagine what it's based on.
Walther PPK with silencer. High velocity, extreme penetrating power.
Yes, it's a very fine weapon.
Tempered steel. Very effective at close range.
But I have no need for these. They're crude.
Dammit, these are the most...
Stopwatch, please.
When I nod, you start the stopwatch.
When I indicate 'stop', stop.
This needle is dipped in curare. How long did it take?
Three tenths of a second.
Now, this contains 65 weapons.
This has 82 different functions.83 ifyou wish to light a cigar.
Chemical analysis ofthat dart.
That's odd.
In addition to the poison, there were traces of garlic, saffron and fennel on the feather.
What proportions, sir? - Propor...? Here.
Marseilles. Bouillabaisse.
Huh?
Throughout the world in thepreparation of bouillabaisse, the proportion of garlic to saffron and fennel...
...is two cloves of garlic to a pinchof saffron to a dash offennel.
Now, only in a certainsmall section of Marseilles...
...are these three condimentsprepared in these proportions.
Whoever handled that dart was inMarseilles within the last 24 hours.
Goodbye, sir.
Hold it, hold it.
These are the men under your command. - I don't need anyone, sir.
You said you'd join the team.
- The team isn'tjoining me.
Dammit, man, for once you'll follow orders!
- This is my mission, sir. I work alone.
Your mission? The US Government isinvolved too, not to mention the world!
It's my show now.
You're under arrest, Flint!
I'm glad to see you kept up your karate, sir.
These men wore Battle ofthe Bulge ribbons.
There's no ribbon for the Battle ofthe
Bulge. - Exactly. They're impostors.
Gridley? He's been with us... That's Gridley!
Sir, ifyou look around the eyes, you'll see some scars.
On the bridge ofthe nose. Plastic surgery.
You've cracked. All this high living - you've cracked.
In here! They're dead! ln here! They're dead!
Gridley! - This one's gone.
Excuse me, sir. - What are you doing? What are you doing!
We still might save him.
I've got a beat.
I, uh... I'll arrange for yourtransportation to Marseilles.
Oh, no, that won't be necessary, sir. I have my own jet.
Yourattention, please. PagingMrDerek Flint.
Yourplane is ready, sir.
You said nine o'clock, Mr Flint.
Yes.
Thank you.
Mmm. Yes.
Check, please.
Finest bouillabaisse in
Marseilles, monsieur.
Merci, monsieur.
The shipment went as scheduled.
I had some free time, and only here do theyreally make bouillabaisse. I thought...
You thought? It is your musclethat thinks, not your brain.
And this in plain sight of everyone.
A harmless jar of cream. A little gift for one's wife.
A harmless jar of cream? Someone in thisden ofthieves stole it and examined it.
Well, I thought...- You will leave at once.
Look slowly to your right.
Yeah! More! Come on, baby, come on.
Come on, let's see you work hard.
Come on, baby!
Hello, Flint. - 0008.
I wanted a word with you.
- Yeah, my pleasure.
Narcotics. A new, powerful drug. Hear anything?
No. SPECTRE involved? -
It's bigger than SPECTRE.
Who is it?
GALAXY.
GALAXY? ls that all? - That's it.
So long, 0008. - So long, Flint.
Hans Gruber, Hitler Youth Movement, escaped during the Nuremberg trials.
I'm a much nicer person now.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Appenine-Tuscan kaolin.
Water from the Pontine Marshes.
Cold cream.
Rome? Why the hell is he going to
Rome? - I don't exactly know, sir.
'To buy ajar of cold cream.'
Cold cream. Cold cream, eh?
The world is crumblingand he's buying cold cream.
Yourreport? - Mr Flint will cause no more trouble.
An interesting statement, butnotfactual.
The explosion. I heard it myself.
The explosion was live, and unfortunatelyso is Mr Flint.
Thanks to Rodney's desire forproof, we discovered there were no remains.
Why didn't you tell me? - That you were unsuccessful again?
Rodney, you mustlearn patience.
Gentlemen, forgive me. You are scientists.
As such, you are accustomed to failure.
It merely increases your desire for success.
But in my business, failure is inexcusable.
We've treated Flint too lightly.
He's too dangerous to live.
Yes. We've lostseveralgoodmen, anda valuedfriendin Gruber.
Gentlemen, I'd welcome the opportunity...-
We have notyetlost confidence in Gila.
Mr Flint will cause no more trouble. I...
...havejust received the information I requested.
You mean the impregnable Mr
Flintdoes have one weakness?
No, Dr Schneider. Four.
Madam? - Yes, would you unzipper me, please?
Thank you.
'Am walking into... trap.'
'Heading for the Exotica Beauty Factory.'
'If lucky, will lead to laboratory.'
'If not, please send flowers.'
I'm leaving for Rome immediately.
You can contact me at the embassy.
Gila? Our visitorhas arrived.
Good. Now I can silence him permanently. - Put away the gun.
Violence hasn't worked. You have proof...
...ofthat. Besides, how do you know he is alone?
All right, Gila. But you'd better be right this time.
It is my responsibility to deliver Flint.
Buongiorno. Do you have an appointment?
Well, not really, but I would liketo see the manager, if at all possible.
My card.
Please, I couldn't think of accepting this.
Yes?
There's a man here. He's very insistent...- My name is Flint.
I didn't...- Thank you very much, my dear.
You have a very charmingand efficient secretary.
Mr Flint, do you alwaysbarge into people's offices?
No, I'd rather be invited.
Come in.
I've a feeling I was expected. Have we met before?
Twice before, Mr Flint. Once in
New York and once in Marseilles.
Oh, you must have been the blond harpist.
And Gruber's friend.
And you left me a little present. Ajar like this, right?
May I look inside? - Some ofthem are harmless, Mr Flint.
You were right. We were expecting you.
Well, here I am. Now, shall wetalk about the weather?
About what? - The weather.
Of course. But not here.
Personal matters require privacy.
Oh, you have some little place in mind? A... a trap?
You are prepared to take some risks, no?
I'll answer all your questions. Is that a deal?
It's cold cream. - Cold cream.
Yes, it's a deal.
How romantic. Rome at night.
A sky full of stars.
It is marvellous, isn't it?
You can almost see a whole galaxy from here.
Shall we discuss it further?
I thought we were gonnatalk about the weather.
You won't believe me. You're too shrewd, tooexperienced to pay attention to our secret.
You try me.
They are controlling the weatherfrom inside a volcano.
Right. Inside a volcano.
Where? Where is this volcano?
Not so fast, Mr Flint.
There are many other details.
Get some brandy.
Now, tell me more about that volcano.
He took the key. He's on his way.
You say you speak English? - Yes, sir.
This man you described, you took him to this address?
Yes. He was the one who was sitting therefiguring out the lottery numbers.
Mm? Oh. Yeah.
There's the building...
What's the trouble? - There's no building.
Will someone tell this idiot to make sense? - All right, now what happened?
Do you think he...? - General,
I didn't have anything to drink.
Now, just a minute. Nobody's accusing you of anything.
We both know there was a building there.
And buildings can't disappear into thin air.
So what happened to the building?
- It disappeared into thin air.
Great intelligence work. Your next post will be Peyton Place!
You talk about discipline.
Why did you stop me from killing Flint?
- Are you questioning my loyalty?
No, no.
I merely thought you might have felt...
...certain stirrings.
You are romantic yourself, Rodney.
There's verylittle air in thatsafe.
Flint will die of suffocation.
Your way wouldhave been kinder. - Myapologies, Gila.
How very thoughtfulyou are.
'Have discovered locationof enemy headquarters.'
'Advise you send fleet thereat once and destroy it.'
Congratulations on the capture ofFlint.
You have done well, Section Four.
You willbe pleased to knowFlint's fourplaymates have arrivedatheadquarters, andare nowin the proc essofbeingprogrammed.
Get him back! We gotta find that location! - Yes, sir.
That's it. That's... What's the message?
'Will give you location later.'
'Am headed for...
...a family reunion. Regards, Flint.'
A... family reunion?
Well, you were right. He's dead.
You will arrange for the coffin.
- I've already arranged it.
It's on its way. - You were very sure.
Yes. Weren't you?
Send it.
This photograph arrived minutes ago.
It speaks for itself.
He was the best.
Undisciplined, but the best.
He was a legend.
Yes, sir? At once.
Gentlemen, your attention, please. The television screen.
I don't know, sir. It's on all channels.
Who are they?
People ofthe world, there is no need to panic.
Please do notbe alarmed.
We are yourfriends.
Members ofthe Grand Council, youjust witnesseda live transmission, remote-controlledfrom the Arctic region. - Get a radio fix on this.

Take over.
Gila, we're approaching the island. Do you want to go on deck?
Oh, no. Why force themto turn offthe waterfall?
What nonsense. As iftherecould be a man like that.
I believe your friend in the box therewas brought up on stuff like that.
Poor heroic Mr Flint.
Report, please. - Section Four reporting. Mission successful.
You have proof?. Afterall, you havemade quite a few unsuccessfulattempts.
That's true, Dr Wu, but...-
Valuable time has been wasted.
Several colleagues have been lost, and all through sheer negligence.
Had I been in charge, Dr
Wu, things wouldhave...
...been different. Flint was only a man.
Mr Flint was no ordinary man!
We have his body with us. - How unfortunate there was no other way.
Report to headquarters. And congratulationson the elimination ofFlint.
No! Help!
Absolutely no one is getting through, sir.
Gentlemen, I give you Mr Flint.
Come on.
Say, why does that eagle attack me?
He's been trained to recogniseand attack Americans.
An anti-American eagle.
It's diabolical.
Come on. We can't keep 'em waiting.
Mr Flint,
I am Dr Krupov.
Doctor.
I am very happy to meet you in person.
Thank you, sir. - And this is Dr Wu and Dr Schneider.
How do you do? - Dr Schneider.
Dr Wu.
Gentlemen... I have not hadthe pleasure of meeting Mr Flint.
I am Malcolm Rodney.
Oh, yes.
How very smart you lookin your
GALAXY uniform, Mr Flint.
Don't you think so, Gila?
We found this in his pocket, sir.
The Americans' fondnessfor marvellous toys!
A weapon too, perhaps?
You are obviously anextraordinary fellow, Mr Flint.
That you have come this faris a great tribute, Mr Flint.
Well, thank you. - I would say it's more of a tribute to Gila.
To Gila? - Yes.
Or rather to her individuality.
She has allowed self-interestto supersede her loyalty to GALAXY.
If Rodney had shown me more loyalty...- I carried out your orders.
We were unsuccessful three times.
I could have disposed of Flint!
- Gila, Rodney is right.
As head of Section Four, you wereresponsible for every mission.
But I have given my life to GALAXY.
Gentlemen, it seems to me...
...that what it comes to is this: ln a moment of extreme decision, our dear Gila made an instinctive choice.
But that choice was not for GALAXY.
Her conditioning is incomplete. It is our mistake.
We made a sentimental misjudgment.
True, Dr Schneider. True. You understand,
Gila. Now, you will be taken to the...
No. It's not fair.
Gila, GALAXY may be served in many ways.
As a woman, there is one wayin which you may best serve GALAXY.
Gila! Gila!
Take her to Preparation.
Take her to Preparation.
How often woman's animal nature triumphs!
Perhaps now, Dr Wu, you'll admit that I was correct.
Strength has its merits, Rodney, but I value intelligence higher.
Gentlemen, Mr Flint's seemingly limitlesstalents can be of value to GALAXY.
Of course. - Yes.
I think Mr Flint has outlived his usefulness.
- We will be the judge ofthat, Mr Rodney.
Mr Flint, we welcome you to GALAXY.
To GALAXY!
Gentlemen,
I thank you very much for your kind offer, but you must know that
I came to GALAXY...
...not to join the organisation, but to destroy it.
You see, gentlemen?
He's not worth saving.
When something is deadly, you kill it!
- It is a new world we offer, Mr Flint.
Gentlemen, your priceis much too high for me.
You are wrong, Mr Flint.
Hear us, Mr Flint.
We seek no master race. We are the friends ofthe common man.
Surely you must have noticedthe absence of guns here in our paradise.
Violence is a last resort.
It was only the unenlightened resistance ofa...
...decadent world that triggered our actions.
Under our guidance you willbecome a useful scientist.
Take him to Preparation.
Wait!
Gentlemen, I'm sorry.
But all my instincts tell me that
Mr Flint's archaic sense of independence...
...mayeventually re-emerge, with disruptive results.
Dr Krupov is right.
Flint will never conform.
It may be best to return him to his elements.
The electro-fragmentiser.
I wonder what it is that always makesthe Rodneys choose the wrong side.
Enjoy your defiance.
It'll be the last pleasureyou have on this earth.
You're a foolish man, Mr Flint.
Gentlemen, the temperature in the Arcticis still rising, and so is the water level.
Sir? It's unanimous.
Capitulation.
The fleet is in readiness?
Yes, sir.
Request permission to joinAdmiral
Davenport in my old unit.
Thank you, sir. I'll leave at once.
Thank you, sir.
Repeat: Mysole purpose in lifeis to bringpleasure to my companions.
My sole purpose in life is to bringpleasure to my companions.
All thatis asked ofme I willperform.
All that is asked of me I will perform.

It is an honour to offer my bodyto the service of GALAXY.
Repeat after me: I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
I am not a pleasure unit.
We have to get up to thatcommunications room. My lighter...
Our lighter has been fragmentised.
They are expecting me in the reward room. - Reward room? What's that?
Never mind. You'll love it.
Brand me.
What?
It's our only chance.
Go ahead.
Present the unit, please.
- Pleasure Unit 504.
Present the unit, please.
Pleasure Unit 736.
Unit 736 is welcome here.
Enter, 736, andgo to the firstrobing room.
It's me, Anna. You're not a pleasure unit.
You're not a pleasure unit.
You're not a pleasure unit.
Now listen, girls. You stay right herewith
Gila. I'll be back for you all shortly.
Where are you going?
I'm going to put GALAXY into orbit.
Ladies andgentlemen, the president ofthe United States.
My fellowAmericans, whatlhaveto say does not come easily.
Butl cannotshirk myresponsibility, nor can lkeep from you the gravityofthe crisis we are nowfacing.
Itis with a heavyheart thatlmakethe following announcement:
People ofallnations, all ofyou knowsomething ofthe events ofthe pastfew weeks...
Flint?! - It can't be!
Of course it can. That's why he's Flint.
Purple alert!
We have allbeen witness...-
Purple alert. Purple alert.
All units, air and naval. The mountain island, latitude 18 degrees 9 minutes north,
Iongitude 11 degrees 3 minutes west. Destroy! Destroy!
Commander, the bridge.
Are you there, sir? Sir, stall!
Stall, dammit! Flint is alive!
Uh, no, uh...
No great decision...- 54, 22, 37.
Does anyone know this code? - No.
No. - Well, it must have some meaning.
Communications room, Dr Wu speaking. Come in, please.
Communications room? Dr
Krupov. Come in, please.
Come in, please. Dr Schneider calling.
- Rodney, check communications room.
Communications room? Dr
Schneiderspeaking. Come in.
Communications room, come in...
Attention. Attention.
Flinthas escaped. Findhim.
Findhim.
There he is! Get him!
Get back! The wheel! - The steam!
Somebody kill the steam!
I'll get it...
Get Flint!
Up there!
Don't, Mr Flint! You will destroy the...
...potentialof all of mankind, organised for good.
Not for my good, Dr Wu. - Mr Flint!
It would mean an end for all time topoverty, disease, doubt and frustration!
Mr Flint, we have the power to doaway with excessive heat and cold!
To turn wastelands into Gardens of Eden! -
All I have to do is take a bite ofyour apple?
No, thanks. - No, Mr Flint!
Mr Flint! No!
Ours would be a perfect world! Why?
Because it's your idea ofperfection, gentlemen, not mine.
It is better to surrender than todestroy this great work. Agreed?
Yes! - Agreed!
All right, Mr Flint. The power is yours. Take it.
Please, take it, Mr Flint. There has been too much violence.
It is senseless to take more lives. - It is not senseless to take one more life!
Hey! Come on!
You people out there, pay attention!
Lower a boat. - Aye aye, sir.
Blankets.
Bring them up to the bridge.
Sir?
Yes, sir?
Yeah! Over a waterfall, sir. Yes, in steel drums.
Yeah, that's right. In drums!
D-r-u-m-s.
Yes. Oh, he wrecked the whole island!
He had no drum, he dove offthe topofthe island. Gotta be a world record!
No, sir, I don't know his political affiliation.
He is young enough to be a senator, yes, sir.
I believe he's aboard, sir. Wouldyou like to speak with him? Yeah.
Flint? Flint, our commander in chiefwould like to...
The commander in chiefwould liketo congratulate you and your friend.
Flint!
I'm sorry, he's indisposed at the moment, sir.
What?
I can't hear ya!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
- What's your name?
- Barran.
You're the one I'm looking for.
You knew one of my friends.
- He was supposed to come back.
- Who?
He was a doctor, like you.
His name is Mozart... Mozart, like the musician.
Try to remember.
Never heard of him.
Nice gun, nice girl.
What was it exactly?
Smith and Wesson.45.
Not the gun... the girl.
Somebody looking for somebody.
Everybody is looking for somebody.
Not me...
I don't know anybody.
Well, if it was me, a girl like that...
I'd know whoever she wanted me to know.
I'd say,
"Mademoiselle, this guy you're looking for,
I used to play golf with him at Dien Bien Phu."
You're American?
I'm everything... depends on who's paying.
You're French, huh?
No, I'm a drunk, and a tightwad.
Good luck.
Bye, Doctor.
Lieutenant, if you're not gonna sign on again, what are you gonna do?
I know some folks who need a doctor.
Listen, Pop,
I'm not a doctor either.
All I ever did was to patch up some poor bastards so they could go back and get shot up for good.
And now I've had it.
I'm up to here with the whole mess, and with you on my back all the time.
Is that clear?
So leave me alone.
Hey, why don't you make yourself useful?
Where can
I lose this?
Right up to here with money too, huh?
This isn't money.
It's my pay.
Go for broke.
I ain't got your looks,
Lieutenant.
I have to pay to see the ladies.
Whoa-oa.
Don't worry about the doctor.
He always finds a chopper to get back to base.
Then they decorate him.
Huh?
Anything else you're up to here with, Lieutenant?
Do you ever make it?
Last one, Doc.
Yeah.
Anything else in there worthwhile?
How come there's one missing, huh?
You know, my first gun was even bigger than this.
I was just a kid then.
I could hardly lift the damned thing.
And that's when I lost my first war too.
When I pick a side, you can bet the other side is gonna win.
Anyhow, it's a job with a future.
There are plenty of wars to be lost.
Doc,
I've got a line to the Congo.
Come with me.
I already answered that one, Pop.
There'll be 15 of us... radio man, a medic, everything.
But we need a doctor.
We split everything at the end.
And who knows? At the end, there might not be 15 of us left.
What the hell do you want from me?
All right, come on.
Move over.
You know that fellow,
Mozart?
I knew him all right.
I used to play golf with him in Dien Bien Phu.
He never was in Dien Bien Phu.
- Name?
- Moreau.
Isabelle Moreau.
- Married?
- No.
- Profession?
- Photographer in a big company.
What kind of company?
Petroleum products, synthetic fibers, that kind of thing.
In Marseille?
No, in Paris.
And you made this trip because you love music?
I never said I loved him.
I wasn't his mistress.
I needed him, that's all.
What for?
Yesterday it seemed like the end of the world.
Today it doesn't matter.
What for?
I got him a job doing medical checkups on the staff at the company I work for.
He promised me.
Don't they have civilian doctors to do medical checkups?
You drive 2,000 kilometers there and back in tears... and in a rented car... just to give a soldier a job any doctor can do.
Interesting.
Who do you think you're kidding?
They do the checkup in the basement
- just before the Christmas weekend.
- So what?
Not any doctor would let himself be locked up in the basement the last night.
- What's in the basement?
- A safe.
- What's in the safe?
- Nothing.
Then why do you want to open it?
To put these back... bearer bonds,
50,000 francs' worth, that's all.
It's a 30-story building.
The basement is the publicity department. It's enormous... full of corridors.
They do their medical checkups here in the conference room.
The strong room is just next door.
How was Mozart going to get in?
The door is electrically controlled.
I have diagrams of all the switches and circuits.
- Was it all right, sir?
- Perfect.
What about the safe?
There's a seven-figure combination... we figured out the way to get it.
Who's we,
Mozart and you?
Both of us.
I've been personnel director here for 10 years.
I had six others before you, Dr. Barran.
You're the youngest one yet.
That's all in your favor.
Between 30 and 40 are the best working years of a man's life.
Your predecessors were all too slow, Dr. Barran.
This company employs
300 people... five minutes each, six a half hour,
12 an hour, 96 a day.
It'll take you three days... we've allotted you three days.
This is your assistant,
Doctor.
Mademoiselle Austerlitz, our company controller's daughter.
She's a medical student.
What do you want a doctor for, anyway?
I want to take them on a nice long trip with me.
- You're going off again?
- Now don't ask too many questions.
You haven't changed, have you?
Not very much, baby.
Will I see you soon?
As soon as you get me a doctor.
It's very important.
Thanks.
There's a man downstairs.
His name is Barran.
He's a medical lieutenant.
I want to know his address and what he's doing here.
Yeah.
Hey, Doc, you've come up in the world since Marseille.
Not far enough since you're here.
With me, it's different.
I haven't found my way.
I don't want to be nosy, but the Congo is in the other direction.
I still need a doctor.
And the guys you find nowadays... all they want to be is like everybody else... petty bureaucrats cooped up in cages.
Is that where you're doing the medical checkups, Doc?
What did you come here for?
I could use some money, thought maybe you'd like to buy this back.
- How much?
- You name it.
You still haven't told me why there's one bullet missing, Doc, but I'll find that out too.
There'll be two missing then.
I don't want to see you again.
Don't worry, Doc... you will.
Who's that?
A guy.
Is that yours?
Yes, it's mine.
You can get dressed.
When was it you had that positive TB reaction?
Last year.
- Can I call the next, Doctor?
- I'll tell you when I'm ready.
Do you ever look anybody in the face?
What's the matter?
Don't you like my face?
Franz Propp... my name is Franz Propp.
Yeah.
Gentlemen, my girlfriend's name is Catherine.
Say hello,
Catherine.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Don't you ever fail,
Mr. Propp?
Never.
And have you belonged to Mr. Propp for a long time?
Since this evening.
I'd like to be a doll.
Franz would pull a string in my back... like this... and you know what
I'd say?
I love you, I love you,
I love you.
Martha, there'll be five of us tonight.
And listen,
I shall be very disappointed if there isn't a doll in the house when we get there.
That's right, Martha... a doll.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
This is it, boys...
10 times the ante.
I was born in Montpelier.
I'm 24 years old.
- I'm beautiful.
- No, not that!
- I don't know what to say.
- You're an idiot.
Well?
Well?!
- Well, I'm waiting!
- Papa gone.
- Yeah!
- Papa gone.
Papa gone.
Now tell us a story.
- I don't know where to begin.
- Make one up... any kind of a story.
Once upon a time...
Leave me alone, leave me alone.
Quickly, please.
As quick as you can.
5 Rue Pont de Neuilly.
Yes, 5.
Good luck.
But I don't even know where to find you again.
You don't know how lucky you are.
Montparnasse.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, Doctor.
Which way is the White Zone?
I've been here six months and I still don't understand it.
I think it's down there.
Good morning, Doctor.
Morning.
- Weekend?
- Weekend.
Weekend.
I didn't say to look at me all the time.
You can do something else.
Hi.
Well...
What time do they open the safe?
In the afternoon. Every Friday they put in the account books.
This will take three pictures a second.
All you have to do is switch it on when they get into the room
- and stop it when they leave.
- Does it make noise?
Not on the other side.
I've done what I could here.
It's funny... tonight is the first time we won't be together.
Will you miss me?
No.
Basement staff, basement staff, staff working in the basement are to leave the corridors.
Staff working in the basement are to leave the corridors.
Immediate order... evacuate the corridors, please.
Why do they clear everybody out of the corridors?
They've brought down the Christmas bonuses.
- Extra month pay?
- It's all the pay and bonuses.
The banks are closed down over the holidays.
Inhale.
Do they keep the money in the safe over the weekend?
I guess so.
Cough.
- Is it a lot?
- I guess so.
My heart isn't making that noise, is it?
No, the X-ray machine is out of order.
Cough.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't know.
- How much is in there?
- They say two million.
That's not bad for a staff of 300.
Yes, but there's also the factory pay.
- I'll explain it.
- Explain what?!
That you were after the money right from the start?
But you're crazy.
I didn't ask you to open the safe to take out anything. I just want you to put my bonds in, mine!
I haven't changed.
And I'm not supposed to touch the two million?
No. You're crazy.
How long will it take to develop this?
It will be ready at quarter after 6:00.
Well, we're finished.
I want to thank you for your help.
Merry Christmas,
Mademoiselle Austerlitz.
Merry Christmas, Doctor.
- Happy Christmas, Doctor.
- Same to you.
Oh, I'm sticking around, but I've already got my Christmas present.
Forget the whole thing. I've only got three figures out of seven.
Third, fourth, and the last... that's all.
The rest are no good. if we need four figures, that makes 10,000 possible combinations.
I've got three days and nights to try them all.
- No.
- Why not?
I might hit it on the first try.
No, I don't want you to.
I'll explain it to them.
I'll give the bonds back.
If I give back the bonds, they won't do anything to me.
They're all wearing gloves in the pictures.
I thought of that.
There isn't a single fingerprint in the whole strong room.
It's a sanctuary.
If I don't get out before, we'll meet at my place on Tuesday morning.
We've been together for two weeks.
I don't even know your first name.
- Dino.
- You really mean it?
You won't touch anything in the safe?
What are you doing here?
I was just about to ask you the same question, Doc.
Attention, please.
Staff in the basement are asked to leave immediately.
- Come on.
- Attention, please.
Staff in the basement are asked to leave immediately.
Get in.
What the hell do you want from me?
When I smell something cooking, Doc,
I want to know what it is.
- Anyhow, we can always yell...
- No.
They've got them at every crossing.
The runs are every 12 hours... at noon and midnight.
- You'll find a way to get out.
- How about you, Doc?
Go to hell.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
How much have they got in there, Doc?
- Not a cent.
- Then why do you want to open it?
To put some in.
See?
Come on, it's time for the run.
Number 555 isn't in the garage office.
He hasn't eaten here.
I guess he just stayed home.
If the management hears about this, we'll all get fired.
You don't stay home when there's over two million in the safe.
I'm going to ask
315 to stand in for him.
No money in the safe, huh?
I didn't ask you to come here.
But I am here!
And I want half.
Get this into your thick skull... we're not gonna touch that money.
Who're you kidding?
I don't care what you think.
You can't stop me from opening that safe, Doc.
You have to sleep some time.
I've got three figures of the combination and you don't.
You'd need six months.
Ahem.
All right.
We'll take turns on the safe.
When it's open, we don't split.
Either you take it all or I'll stop you, all right?
Right.
I'm not left-handed.
You'll learn.
- How many is that?
- About 2,000.
Get any sleep, Doc?
Terrific.
Liar.
You know we're not gonna make it.
Suppose it's the last one.
It's not the last one.
I know, I've tried it.
Thirsty?
That was a lousy trick.
I told you, it's you or me.
Why did they take that?
Well, I don't know.
I guess it was borrowed from someplace.
All right, where's the food?
You put it in there?
All of it?
How could I know?!
Maybe they've got machines in the other corridors.
Barran!
I'll get you.
Watch the fifth knob.
It's beginning to stick.
How many combinations have we tried?
Outside they're having goose liver, oysters, turkey... disgusting.
I had a date too... a girl in a white uniform a little penguin right here... penguin.
Open it.
- Now what?
- There's a patrol in a few minutes.
When they open the doors, we'll get out.
No!
I'm not gonna end up in jail.
We'll wait like good little boys until Tuesday.
The lights.
Don't knock yourself out.
If you'd listened to me, we'd be outside!
If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here in the first place!
Where would we be, shooting Negroes?
People like you make me sick.
You stink!
What are you up to now?
The one thing I know about electricity... it travels through wires.
There's no lock, no key, no window, and no bread in the safe, but we've got... wires all around us.
The door?
No.
I must've shorted the air-conditioning.
If there is some damn fool thing to do, you'll never miss.
Once in Indochina, for 18 hours,
I was in a hole... full of water.
I was alone.
The light's going.
- Are they counterfeit?
- No.
Then they're hot... the banks have their numbers or something.
I wasn't going to keep them.
You wanted to get a hold of the two million, didn't you, Doc?
No.
Then what the hell are you doing here?
That's the whole point,
Pop.
I'm not here.
She needed a patsy in this basement and I replaced the patsy.
I'm a stand-in... a mirage.
How come?
There are some things we have to do.
Light!
Is it noon or midnight?
I don't know anymore.
Well, if it's midnight, they're celebrating outside.
What did you say?
"Goose liver, oysters, turkey... and a girl in a uniform."
With a penguin on top and nothing underneath.
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Propp.
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Barran.
I'm rich... filthy rich... investing my bread.
How do we get out of here
Tuesday morning?
Feet first.
How long can a man go without drinking water?
Not until Tuesday.
Now that it doesn't matter much... why was a bullet missing from your gun?
His name was Mozart... like the composer.
He was a doctor like me.
We did everything together... passed exams, chased girls, got drunk, fights.
He had talent for everything, especially for dirty tricks.
You wouldn't believe it.
I guess some people thought he was a bastard... but he was somebody.
He was... well, a brother... more than a brother.
In Algeria one night we were nailed down, near Sétif...
I mistook him for an enemy... and shot him... there!
An hour later, they brought his body back in a helicopter.
And that was the night they decorated me for.
Just the way
I'm telling you.
Well, you can't always tell your friends from your enemies.
Come right down to it, maybe they're the same thing.
It's like this.
Look.
Is it giving us light or is it suffocating us?
Is Mozart the one the girl was waiting for in Marseille?
Yeah, but I didn't want to talk about him.
He tell you about her?
He told me about a promise he made to somebody... a sort of
Christmas present.
Yeah? What then?
Nothing.
That's it.
You mean to tell me you're in this mess because of him?!
Well, I'm not a dancer!
What the hell difference does that make? He's dead!
He never let me down and I won't let him down.
Now shut up!
Some guy, this Mozart.
If he was so great, how would he get out of here, huh?
Bring the light.
- What's the matter?
- It's cold here, only here.
There's a shaft behind it.
Are you crazy?
Yeah.
It's the same... if they take us now or Tuesday.
Except now we are alive.
Go on, your turn.
We'd better work in the dark.
We're gonna choke.
Did it make you think of the good old days?
Better than that, Doc.
You've got another laugh coming.
Have a look.
He's been dead more than two days.
Shot four times with a.45.
Must've been Friday while the people were leaving and making all that racket.
I left Isabelle in the cafe just then.
So she couldn't have done it.
Who do you think did it?
Ask him.
If this is Tuesday, they're going to open the doors around 8:00.
It's Tuesday.
- Who told you?
- It was exceptionally fine weather throughout France for the weekend.
And now that Christmas is over, everyone is returning to work.
That gives us three hours to clean up our prints.
Had a good weekend?
Oh, great.
Yeah.
Bad news gets around fast.
If I hadn't been hungry, they would have got me up there.
What are you gonna do now?
Find Isabelle.
I got plenty,
I sold a doll.
You need anything else, you call the Val-de-Grâce, extension 18.
I've got pull there.
No, you fly to Marseille.
I will too.
And we'll meet at the bar in front of the camp.
And remember, you were never in that basement.
You don't know me.
You don't have to worry about me, Doc.
I'm not worrying about you.
We'll get at least 10 years if they find out there were two of us.
Give me your word.
I ain't got one, Doc.
Give it anyway.
Farewell, friend.
I repeat,
Dino Barran, age 32, eyes blue, hair brown.
This man is armed.
Shoot after first warning.
I repeat: this man is armed.
Shoot after first warning.
Over.
Flight 637, scheduled at 12:35, boarding expected at 12:05, gate number 12.
Chief Inspector Méloutis...
Antoine Pierre Mille.
Drop that razor.
Hey, you.
Get going, fathead.
Synteco Advertising, good morning.
I would like to speak to Isabelle Moreau... photographic department, please.
One minute, please.
- Did you say Isabelle Moreau?
- Yes.
I'm sorry. There is no such name on the staff list.
What did you say?
I said this person is not employed here.
Alone! Alone... everybody is alone.
Me too, I'm alone.
But it happens there were two of you in that basement.
I spend my weekends in the country, not in basements.
You were in Algeria together, you were repatriated together, you were at St. Martha's camp together, and you don't know him?!
Coincidences.
What do you take me for?
Um...
- a cop?
- Right.
You don't know Barran and I'm a cop.
I can't get it through my thick head, but I can try.
You just explain it slowly.
Explain what?
How it happened, for instance, this morning at Orly, that at the same moment you were both there together?!
Coincidence.
I know something that's going to coincide with your kisser.
Hey, that's a beautiful lifeline you have there.
I'm telling you, time is on my side.
Take him out and start over again from the beginning.
When he's tired, let me know.
Don't be afraid.
I'll let you go as you soon as you're quiet.
You're the only one who can help me.
That's why I'm here.
It's a lie... all lies.
Listen to me, my only chance to prove it... is you.
You're alone here?
I don't know this guy Barran.
I wasn't in the basement,
I was in the country. You go to hell.
Where in the country?
Normandy.
Had oysters, goose liver and turkey.
Who were you with, a girl?
Two... a blonde and then a... brunette. And I didn't get a wink of sleep.
Recognize this?
- You let me sleep if I do?
- Okay.
It's a holster, Sheriff.
Good night.
Wake him up.
Who shot the watchman, you or him?
I don't know the guy.
Who had the safe combination, you or him?
You know, this is, uh... none of my business, but this man Barran... he's a doctor. That means he's an educated man.
Now if he had done it, he would've planned this and it wouldn't be so simple for you.
He did plan it.
We got this off the conveyor belt, see?
Did you see
Barran's record?
He's a great shot... certified.
So what?
So he wouldn't need four shots to kill that guard.
One would have been enough.
Say, you know a lot of things, don't you?
I've read it in the paper.
Ask, uh... him.
When I went out of the garage, a car tried to run me down.
Was it Isabelle's, the one she had in Marseille?
I didn't see, I don't know.
I don't think so.
In Marseille, it was a rented car.
- Mustard.
- You told me it was white.
Not the color of the car.
I mean, get me the mustard!
Mustard!
You don't believe a word
I told you, do you?
There's an American they've arrested.
Was he with you in the basement?
No, I was alone.
Then who took the money?
Somebody who knew the combination.
On Friday night when I got myself shut in there, the safe was already empty.
Somebody put me there to make it look spectacular.
In fact, it was much simpler... all they had to do was take the money and go.
- Hmm?
- How could they? When?
When everybody had left and the corridors were empty.
The guard had the bad idea to come along just then.
But he was killed with your gun.
That too... all they had to do was take it.
- You live here with your father?
- Yes.
He's been in Switzerland for two months.
- What's wrong with him?
- Coronary thrombosis.
How far have you got with your medical school?
Third year...
I mean,
I'm doing the first year for the third time.
- What's your first name?
- Dominique.
- They call me Waterloo.
- Why?
Oh, because my name is Austerlitz.
Ah.
It's on account of my exams.
They're always a disaster.
I get in a panic.
Come here...
Waterloo.
Are you going to help me?
That name...
Isabelle Moreau... her job at Synteco, the address she gave me, it was all a lie.
She thought of everything to keep me from pursuing her, except for one thing... she came to the medical checkup and had a card on the uniform like everybody else.
And I have one witness... you.
There were dozens of girls.
How can you expect me to remember one?
You filed her card, so you can find it again.
I need that card.
No, I can't do it.
No no no!
No!
You killed him.
I'm sure of it. You killed him!
Tomorrow you will go to the office, Waterloo.
- No.
- And get me that card.
No.
No.
Let go of me!
Please.
No.
Oh, let go of me.
Yeah?
- It's me, Chief.
- I know it's you.
- So what?
- I've got something.
Barran was hired for the medical checkup on the strength of a note signed by the general manager.
- Want me to read it to you?
- What for? It's a fake.
- How do you know?
- What else?
We've been over the whole ventilating shaft from where he broke in and there's only evidence for one man.
Any prints in the vault?
No, he cleaned everything up.
They cleaned everything up.
- Is that all?
- That's all.
You get up early?
No, I go to bed late.
Come on.
I'll tell you something... something that comes from here.
I think it's great you don't squeal on a friend.
I admire that.
He's no friend of mine, Sheriff.
Never laid eyes on him.
What have you got there anyway?
Come on.
Sit down.
I like this time of night.
Where were you born?
In a tree.
Me, I was born in the Arden.
You don't know the Arden and I don't know the United States.
Why don't you say what you gotta say?
Something that comes from here.
No kidding.
It's damn depressing to think that you're going to wind up in jail for life
- and what for?
- I'm gonna cry.
Listen, Franz... we know this Barran opened the safe.
We know it was his gun.
So why deny it?
If you would give us a break, it will go down in your record.
I'll put it down myself in black and white.
And you know what?
They think a lot of me.
They listen to what I say.
I'll do better than that.
I'll talk to the judge and with your decorations they'll let you out easy.
I'll bet my right hand you'll get off with a suspended sentence.
Sorry, lefty,
I wasn't in that basement.
But I'm gonna tell you something that comes from here.
If Barran didn't blow that safe, he had the combination.
Who gave it to him?
He had three days and three nights to try all the possible combinations.
Figure it out.
It would have taken six months.
Look, this is very hard to do.
If I can put five big coins in here without spilling it, will you promise me you will go out and look for who gave him the combination?
- And if you lose?
- If I lose?
Okay.
If you lose, you tell me why you ran away this morning at Orly when nobody was after you.
Okay.
The last one, cop.
Well, if you don't know
Barran why were you running so fast at Orly?
Why?
The truth.
On the night of Thursday to Friday...
I was at a party in Neuilly and it got rough towards the end.
And I have witnesses.
You're lying!
That's him.
Papa gone.
Papa gone.
- On a glass turntable?
- Mm-hmm.
- And it stopped whatever you wanted?
- Mm-hmm.
How was the girl?
Too good for you, cop.
Why didn't you come before?
- Before what?
- Before all this.
Three months, a week ago, how do I know?
Oh, it's one of Daddy's shirts.
What's your father like?
Wonderful.
Why do you ask?
Has your mother been dead a long time?
- Since me.
- He never got married again?
No.
Why do you ask that?
What do the papers say?
The American admitted he was with you in the basement.
I dreamed of water last night.
Water everywhere.
I knew a guy once, he was in a hole full of water in Indochina.
18 hours... alone.
Quite a guy.
That's a lousy trick printing lies like this!
That ought to shake your pal up a little.
No, he's no friend of mine.
He couldn't care less.
I followed your advice.
I looked at the safe again.
I'm sorry, Franz.
Nobody gave him the combination.
If you had tried them all in order, you would have got the right one long before the weekend was over.
Look, it's mathematical.
You up on your history, cop?
Looks like a date... the 18th of June, 1815.
It's Waterloo.
Has father got the money?
Yes.
How is he?
What do you think, after that?
Not here, please.
Keep straight.
I didn't want to kill the guard, Isabelle.
But he arrived just as I was getting out the money.
He yelled.
Why didn't you tell me
Friday night?
I thought it would upset Papa.
Of course you've no idea where Barran is now.
- At home.
- At home?
Yes, at Daddy's place.
At our place.
He wants me to bring him your medical card.
Very well.
If he wants it let him come and get it.
Bring him to the basement tonight.
Where's the gun?
And afterwards we'll go join Daddy and live like before?
Just like before.
Come on, Inspector.
Did he have the combination to the safe?
What was he charged with?
What's your nationality?
- You'll know more tomorrow.
- Why did they do it?
- Was there any money in the safe?
- You're not being very helpful.
They said Barran escaped through the air shaft.
- Is that true?
- Mr. Propp, were you in Korean action?
- What's Propp's relationship to Barran?
- Is there a criminal record?
- Was there any outside help?
- Come on, give us a clue.
- Come on, Inspector.
- What's gonna happen to Propp?
I'm taking him out of circulation until this evening.
He's involved in another case.
Inspector, you only found one pair of gloves in Barran's valise.
So there can't have been two of them.
I don't know Barran, but I'd like him to call me.
He can always find me with this gentleman,
- Inspector Méloutis.
- You've got no right to do that.
I'm taking it.
I'm sorry,
Gilberte.
I've got a dreadful exam.
You can clean the place tomorrow.
- You could've told me.
- I'm sorry, Gilberte.
I brought the paper.
They say you helped the killer.
- Me?
- Yes.
At the medical checkups.
All right, then
I'll be going.
Police,
Mademoiselle.
Are you Dominique
Austerlitz?
We've got a few questions to ask you.
Leave it. The cleaning woman is coming back.
You were Dr. Dino Barran's assistant for three days, weren't you?
Yes.
Come in.
Chief, some crackpot.
They put him on from the switchboard.
Wants to talk to him.
- Who are you?
- And you?
- Franz Propp.
- Morning, Mr. Propp.
Sorry I got you into this mess.
- See they trace the call.
- Right.
Switchboard, trace this call.
That wasn't Propp, this is.
Who's speaking?
- Dino Barran.
- Ah, Mr. Barran.
I don't know you, but if there's anything I can do for you...
What's this Méloutis like?
You could do worse.
Anyhow, he's listening in.
Tell him to come to the Café Breteuil,
Place de Breteuil, at 4:00... alone, of course.
- Think he'll do that?
- I'll try to persuade him.
And wherever you are, split.
They're tracing the call.
I'll make it, don't worry.
I'm not worried.
By the way, how're the girls outside?
Masked, inscrutable.
Wait wait.
Correction... not masked, sympathetic.
A glass of white wine.
Are you
Inspector Méloutis?
Yes.
Where are you, Doc?
Not far... you can even see me.
If you move, you won't see me again.
Who's moving?
Franz Propp wasn't with me in the basement.
Did you come here to tell me that?
No.
I haven't got the gun.
I didn't kill the watchman and I didn't take the money.
When I opened the safe, it was empty.
If that's true, come to headquarters with me.
I'm coming.
Give me till midnight.
Okay, Cinderella, till midnight.
But I warn you... try one fancy step and you will never walk again.
Don't worry about me walking.
Follow him, but don't interfere.
I'm on my way, Chief.
Muratti is on the other side.
- He's all yours, Muratti.
- Right, Chief.
Hey. Hey, now take it easy.
It's time to go.
Let's not go there.
Please let's not go.
Let's go away.
Far away, anywhere!
I know how to cook spaghetti.
I'll let you smoke
Papa's cigars.
I love you.
I'll pass my exams.
I'll read Shakespeare.
I'll learn to make love very well.
But please, let's not go there.
Let's not go.
I need that card.
I know it's been tough, Waterloo.
It's almost over now.
Were you that scared when you shot the guard?
Why did you give her my gun, Isabelle?
She was supposed to leave it there, not to use it.
Anyway, it worked out fine.
You've only got one more shot left.
What if you miss me?
What if I don't?
Get in there.
Stop there.
How did you connect Waterloo with me?
When she told me her nickname... the safe combination was the date of Waterloo.
- Her father gave it to you, didn't he?
- Is that all?
No. I searched the apartment and found that.
- Found what?
- My gun...
- at the bottom of a golf bag.
- You left it there?
Yeah, I wanted to see this through.
You've seen too much.
I'm sorry.
Were you sorry when you tried to run me down in the garage?
That wasn't her, it was me.
I was already in Switzerland with the money.
- And Waterloo's father?
- That's none of your business.
But I am one of the family. Ask her.
She shot Muratti!
She shot Muratti!
The gun is empty.
Don't shoot!
You told me till midnight.
You know what they call a guy who doesn't keep his word?
A dancer.
I'm not your fairy godmother.
I'm not a Boy Scout.
Go to hell, do you hear?
Go to hell!
You'll have my report tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
Come with me.
No, leave it there.
You two must have a lot to say to each other.
Who's that?
The man you called up.
Get up!
If you expected me to leave my fingerprints all over the place,
I didn't.
Do you think
I'd pull a trick like that?
Yeah.
Now that it doesn't matter anymore, Doctor, you might as well tell me you were together.
To make it tougher for him?
To get the truth.
The truth is
I was alone.
Otherwise I'd tell you, wouldn't I?
Yeah.
Yeah.
[Birds chattering and hooting]
[Narrator] Many strange legends
are told of these jungles of India,
but none so strange as the story
of a small boy named Mowgli.
It all began when the silence
of the jungle was broken
by an unfamiliar sound.
[Baby crying]
It was a sound like
one never heard before
in this part of the jungle.
[Crying continues]
It was a man cub!
Had I known how deeply
I was to be involved,
I would've obeyed
my first impulse and walked away.
[Baby laughing, cooing]
[Cooing and laughing]
This man cub would have
to have nourishment, and soon.
It was many days' travel
to the nearest man-village,
and without a mother's care,
he would soon perish.
- [Cooing continues]
- Then it occurred to me.
A family of wolves I knew
had been blessed
with a litter of cubs.
[Whining, whimpering]
[Barking]
[Loud crying]
[Cooing, laughing]
I knew there'd be no problem
with the mother,
thanks to the maternal instinct,
but I wasn't so sure
about Rama, the father.
[Sniffs]
[Crying]
[Cooing, laughing]
[Laughing continues]
Ten times, the rains
had come and gone,
and I often stopped by to see how
Mowgli, the man cub, was getting along.
He was a favourite with all
the young wolf cubs of the pack.
[Imitates howling]
[Howling]
- [Grunts]
- [Panting]
[Laughing]
[Whimpering]
No man cub was ever happier.
And yet, I knew that someday
he would have to go back
to his own kind.
[Wolf howling]
Then one night, the wolf pack
elders met at Council Rock
because Shere Khan, the tiger,
had returned
to their part of the jungle.
This meeting was to change
the man cub's entire future.
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy and all who try to protect him.
Now, are we all in agreement as to what must be done?
Now it is my unpleasant duty to tell the boy's father.
Rama.
Uh, come over here, please.
Yes, Akela?
The council has reached its decision.
The man cub can no longer stay with the pack.
He must leave at once.
"Leave"?
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.
But... But the man cub is...
Well, he's like my own son.
Surely he's entitled to the protection of the pack.
But, Rama, even the strength of the pack is no match for the tiger.
[Rama] But the boy cannot survive alone in the jungle.
Akela, perhaps
I can be of help.
You, Bagheera? How?
I know of a man-village where he'll be safe.
Mowgli and I have taken many walks into the jungle together.
I'm sure he'll go with me.
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.
Good luck.
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.
Shouldn't we start back home?
Mowgli, this time we're not going back.
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?
Because Shere Khan has returned to this part of the jungle...
...and he has sworn to kill you.
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?
He hates man.
Shere Khan is not going to allow you to grow up to become a man, just another hunter with a gun.
Aw, we'll just explain to him that I'd never do a thing like that.
Nonsense. No one explains anything to Shere Khan.
Well, maybe so, but I'm not afraid.
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.
We'll spend the night here.
Things will look better in the morning.
Man Cub?
Man Cub!
Now, come on. Up this tree.
It's safer up there.
Uh... I don't wanna go back to the man-village.
Go on. Up you go.
- That limb way up there?
- That's right.
[Laughing] Is that all the better you can climb?
[Grunting] It's too big around.
And besides, I don't have any claws.
[Grunting]
- Yeow-ohhh!
- [Snarling]
[Groaning]
Now get some sleep.
We've got a long journey ahead of us tomorrow.
I wanna stay in the jungle.
Huh? [chuckles]
You wouldn't last one day.
[Yawns]
I'm not afraid.
I... I can look out for myself.
[Smacking lips]
S-S-S-Say, now.
What have we here?
[Giggles] It's a man cub.
A delic-i-ous man cub.
Oh, go away and leave me alone.
[Yawns] Oh, that's just what
I should do, but I'm not.
Oh, now, please go to sleep, Man Cub.
Yes-s-s-s, Man Cub.
# Pleas-s-se go to sleep
# Please go to sleep
# S-S-Sleep, little man cub
# Rest in peace #
Sleep.
- S-S-S-Sleep.
- [Moaning]
Ba-Ba-Bagheera...
[gulps]
Oh, now... now, look, there's no use arguing anymore.
Now, no more talk till morning.
[Chuckles] He won't be here in the morning.
Huh? Oh, yes, he will. I...
Kaa! Hold it, Kaa!
[Grunts]
Ohhh!
My sinus-s-s-s-s.
You have just made a s-s-s-serious mistake, my friend, a very s-s-s-stupid...
[stammers] Now, Kaa, I was...
[Kaa]... mistake.
Look me in the eye when I'm speaking to you.
No, please, Kaa...
Both eyes, if you please.
You have just s-s-s-sealed your doom.
Ohhh... Aaah!
Aaah! Ooh.
Look, Bagheera.
Look. Bagheera.
Wake up, Bagheera.
[Groaning] Wha...?
Just you wait till I get you in my coils.
Uhhh!
[Mowgli laughing] Bagheera, he's got a knot in his tail!
"He's got a knot in his tail."
[Grunting]
[Moaning] This is going to slow down my s-s-s-slithering.
[Laughing]
- [Laughing stops]
- [Nervous chuckle]
So, you can look out for yourself, can you?
So, you want to stay in the jungle, do you?
Yes, I wanna stay in the jungle.
Ohhh! Now, now, for the last time, go to sleep.
[Muttering] Man cub. Huh!
Man cub. Ahhh.
[Yawns]
[Snoring]
[Rumbling]
# Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up
Two, three, four
- # Hup, two, three, four
- [snoring]
# Keep it up two, three, four
- [yawns]
- # Hup, two, three, four
A parade!
Oh, no.
The dawn patrol again. [sighs]
Company... sound off!
# Oh, the aim of our patrol
# Is a question rather droll
# For to march and drill
over field and hill
[trumpeting]
# Is a military goal
# Is a military goal
# Hup, two, three, four
# Dress it up, two, three, four
# By the ranks or single file
# Over every jungle mile
# Oh, we stamp and crush
through the underbrush
[squeaky trumpeting]
# In the military style
[all] # In the military style
Hello. What are you doing?
Shh! Drilling.
- Can I do it too?
- Sure. Just do what I do.
But don't talk in ranks.
It's against regulations.
[Leader] To the rear... march!
The other way. Turn around.
[Leader] # Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up, two, three, four #
To the rear...
...ho!
Company... halt!
That means "stop."
Company... left face!
March, march, march.
My feet are killing me.
I'm puttin' in for a transfer to another herd.
Silence in the ranks!
- Dress up that line.
- Oooh!
[Clearing throat]
Uh, pull it in, Winifred.
Inspection...
...arms!
[Whispering] Stick your nose out.
- [Whispering] Like this?
- That's right.
[Clicking tongue] A dusty muzzle.
Soldier, remember: In battle, that trunk can save your life.
Take good care of it, my man.
- Yes, sir.
- Very good. Carry on.
- [Clears throat]
- [Munching]
Let's have a little more spit and polish on those bayonets.
Yes, sir.
Esprit de corps.
That's the way I earned my commission in the Maharajah's
Fifth Pachyderm Brigade.
Back in '88, it was...
Or... Or was it?
Here it comes.
The Victoria Cross bit again.
It was then I received the Victoria Cross, for bravery above and beyond the call of duty.
Ha ha!
Those were the days.
Discipline! Discipline was the thing.
Builds character and that sort of thing, you know.
Eh... Uh... Oh.
Uh, where was I?
Oh, yes. Inspection. [clears throat]
Well, very good.
Wipe off that silly grin, soldier.
This is the army.
[Fly buzzing]
[Clears throat] Eyes front.
[Clicks tongue] Lieutenant, that haircut is not regulation.
Rather on the gaudy side, don't you think?
There. That's better.
And as for you...
Oh, there you are.
[Chuckles]
Let's keep those heels together, shall we, son?
OK, Pop.
- Sir.
- Yes, now that's better.
Well, a new recruit, eh?
[Laughs]
- I say, what happened to your trunk?
- Hey!
- Stop that!
- [Gasps, sputtering]
A man cub! Ohh, this is treason!
Sabotage!
I'll have no man cub in my jungle!
- It's not your jungle!
- Hold it! Hold it!
I can explain, Hathi.
Colonel Hathi, if you please, sir.
Oh, yes, yes. Colonel Hathi.
The man cub is with me.
I'm taking him back to the man-village.
- To stay?
- You have the word of Bagheera.
Good.
And remember, an elephant never forgets.
[Muttering] I don't know what the army's coming to these days.
These young whippersnappers.
Who do they think they are?
[Clears throat] Let's get on with it!
Right face!
Forward... march!
Dear, haven't you forgotten something?
Nonsense, Winifred, old girl.
An elephant never forgets.
Well, you just forgot our son.
Uh, our s... Son? Son!
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Quite right.
To the rear... march!
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be a colonel just like my...
If I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times...
- Pop! Look out!
- [Groaning]
- [Thudding]
- [Groaning]
Ohhh! Oww!
Ohhh! Owww! Oooh!
Gee, Pop, you forgot to say "halt."
[Giggling]
He said an elephant never forgets.
- [Laughing stops]
- It's not funny.
Let's get out of here quick before anything else happens.
Bagheera! Where are we goin'?
You're going back to the man-village right now.
I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I'm staying right here.
You're going, if I have to drag you every step of the way.
[Grunting] Let go, you...
You let go of me! [grunting]
[Splash]
[Sputtering]
Ohh!
Oh, that does it.
I've had it, Man Cub.
From now on, you're on your own...
...alone!
Don't worry about me.
[Sighs] Foolish man cub.
[Rustling]
[Munching, slurps]
# Doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee-dee-doo
# Well, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
# Yes, it's a-doo-bah-dee-doo
# I mean, a-doo-bee, doo-bee
Doo-bee, doo-bee
# Doo-bee-dee-doo
# And with... #
Well, now. Ha ha.
What have we here?
[Sniffs]
Hmm. Hey!
What a funny little bit of a...
- Ooh!
- Go away!
Oh, boy, I've seen everything in these woods.
Ooh, what have I run on?
- What a pretty thing this is.
- Leave me alone.
Well, now, that's pretty big talk, little britches.
I'm big enough.
- [Chuckles]
- [Grunting]
[Clicks tongue] Pitiful.
Hey, kid, you need help and ol' Baloo's gonna learn you to fight like a bear.
Come on. I'm gonna show ya.
[Growls]
Ha ha! Yeah!
All right, now, kid, loosen up.
Get real loose, then start to weave.
Weave a little. Now, move.
That's it. Now give me a big bear growl.
- Scare me.
- [Tiny growl]
[Clicks tongue]
Oh, boy.
I'm talkin' about like a big bear.
[Loud roar]
[Roaring continues]
He's in trouble.
I shouldn't have left him alone.
[Growls]
- [Loud roar]
- [Roaring]
- A big one, right from your toes.
- How's that?
[Mowgli continues roaring]
[Baloo laughs] You're gettin' it, kid.
Oh, no! It's Baloo!
That shiftless, stupid jungle bum.
Weave about now.
Look for an opening.
Keep movin'. Keep... [laughs]
You're gettin' it, kid.
Come on! That's it! [laughing]
He's a dandy!
[Chuckles] Fine teacher you are,
Ol' Iron Paws.
Oh! Thanks, Bagheera.
Tell me, tell me, after you knock your pupil senseless, how do you expect him to remember the lesson, hmm?
Well, I... I, uh...
Well, I didn't mean to lay it on him so hard.
I'm not hurt. I'm all right.
I'm a lot tougher than some people think.
You better believe it.
Now, let's go once more.
I want you to keep circlin', or
I'm gonna knock your roof in again.
You'd better keep movin'... Ooh!
Hey! Right on the button.
[Groans]
[Laughs] No. No, no.
No, no. Now you're ticklin'.
[Laughs] No. No, no.
No, no. Now you're ticklin'.
[Laughing]
No. No, n-now, we don't do that here in the jun... No!
No, you're ticklin'.
I can't stand that ticklin'.
[Laughing] Help! Bagheera!
Oh, boy. That's all he needs, more confidence.
- Give up, Baloo?
- I give up, I told ya!
Ha ha! Oooh! I give...
Hey! Ha ha!
You know somethin'?
You're all right, kid.
What do they call you?
Mowgli, and he's going back to the man-village right now.
Man-village? They'll ruin 'im!
They'll make a man out of him.
Oh, Baloo, I wanna stay here with you.
Certainly, you do.
Oh? And just how do you think he will survive?
"How do you think..."
What do you mean, how do you think he...
He's with me, ain't he?
And I'll learn him all I know.
Oh? That shouldn't take too long.
Look, now, it's like this, little britches.
All you gotta do is...
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# Are Mother Nature's recipes
# That bring
the bare necessities of life
- # Wherever I wander
- Ooof!
# Wherever I roam
# I couldn't be fonder
# Of my big home
# The bees are buzzin' in the tree
# To make some honey just for me
# When you look under
the rocks and plants
# And take a glance
at the fancy ants
# Then maybe try a few
You eat ants?
Ha ha! You better believe it.
And you're gonna love the way they tickle.
- [Gasps] Mowgli, look out!
- [Thud]
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
But when?
# They'll come to you
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear can rest at ease
# With just the bare necessities of life
# Now, when you pick a pawpaw
- # Or a prickly pear
- Oww!
# And you prick a raw paw
Well, next time beware
# Don't pick the prickly pear
by the paw
# When you pick a pear
try to use the claw
# But you don't need
to use the claw
# When you pick a pear
of the big pawpaw
# Have I given you a clue?
Golly, thanks, Baloo.
"Pawpaw." Ha!
Of all the silly gibberish.
Come on, Baggy, get with the beat.
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
- They'll come to me!
- # They'll come to you
How 'bout scratchin' that left shoulder while you're up there, Mowgli?
No. Just a hair lower.
There. Right there. That's it. Ohh!
This is beautiful. Oooh, that's good.
Kid, we've got to get to a tree.
This calls for some big scratchin'.
[Laughing] You're lots of fun, Baloo.
[Moaning] Right on it.
Yeah!
That's delicious.
Ohhh! Oooh!
Just a little bit... Mmm.
Yeah! Ha ha!
Oooh!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Ha ha! Oooh!
Yeah!
Oh, man. This is really livin'.
So just try and relax. Yeah.
Cool it.
Fall apart in my backyard.
'Cause let me tell you somethin', little britches...
- [buzzing]
- If you act like that bee...
Uh-uh. You're workin' too hard.
And don't spend your time...
...lookin' around...
...for something you want...
...that can't be found.
# When you find out
you can live without it
# And go along not thinkin' about it
# I'll tell you somethin' true
# The bare necessities of life
will come to you
[sighs] I give up.
Well, I hope his luck holds out.
Mowgli, how about you singin'?
[Together]
# Look for the bare necessities
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
- Yeah, man!
- # I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear
can rest at ease
# With just the bare necessities of life
Yeah!
# With just the bare necessities of life
- # Yeah, man #
- Ha ha ha!
Beautiful. That's real jungle harmony.
I like being a bear.
That's my boy.
You're gonna make one swell bear.
Why, you even sing like one.
Yeah.
[Yawns]
# Doo-bee-doo
# Doo-bee-doo
# Aye-bee doogie-woogie doo
[fly buzzing]
Hey, Mowgli, how about you flickin' that ol' mean fly off of your papa bear's nose?
Ouch!
[Chuckles] Boy, when you flick a fly, you really...
Why, you flat-nosed, little-eyed, flaky creep!
Hey! Let go of me!
[Monkeys laughing]
Take your flea-pickin' hands off of my cub!
Come on and get 'im, champ!
- He ain't no champ! He's a chump!
- Baloo!
Yeah! Ha ha! A big hothead!
OK, you guys asked for it. I'll...
- Oooh!
- That'll cool 'im off! [laughing]
Gimme back my man cub!
Here he is! Come and get 'im!
[Monkeys chattering, hooting]
That's how a bear can rest at ease!
Here's some bare necessities!
Now, just try that again, you...
- What's that you hit him with, son?
- That was a bare necessity!
You turn him loose, or I'll jerk a knot in your tail!
We give up!
- Here he comes!
- Whoa-ohh-ohh!
- Baloo! Catch me!
- [Monkeys laughing]
- Baloo!
- Back up! Back up! Faster! Faster!
Faster!
- [Giggling]
- A rolling bear gathers no hair!
Baloo, help me!
Baloo! They're carrying me away!
Bagheera!
[Echoing] Bagheera!
Well, it's happened.
Took a little longer than I thought, but it's happened.
[Grunting]
- Bagheera!
- [Snarls]
[Echoing] Bagheera!
Oh, you heard me, huh?
Mowgli. Mowgli!
All right, what happened?
Where's Mowgli?
They ambushed me.
Thousands of 'em.
I jabbed with my left, then I swung with a right...
Oh, for the last time, what happened to Mowgli?
Like I told ya, them mangy monkeys carried him off!
The ancient ruins.
Ohh, I hate to think what will happen when he meets that king of theirs.

Cool it, boy. Unwind yourself.

"Stay in the jungle"? I sure do.
Good. And ol' King Louie...
# Bah-be-do-bay
Bu-bu-doo
That's me.
...can fix it for you.
Have two bananas.
Have we got a deal?
Yes, sir, I'll do... [gulps]

[Whistling tune]
[# Singing in gibberish]
[Applause, cheering]
[Giggling]
Gee, Cousin Louie, you're doin' real good.
Now here's your part of the deal, cuz.
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire.
But I don't know how to make fire.
# Now, don't try to kid me, Man Cub
# I made a deal with you
# What I desire is man's red fire
# To make my dream come true
# Now give me the secret, Man Cub
# Come on
Clue me what to do
# Give me the power
of man's red flower
- # So I can be like you

Fire? So that's what that scoundrel's after.
I'll tear 'im limb from limb.
I'll beat 'im. I'll... I'll...
Mmm. Yeah!
Well, man, what a beat.
Will you stop that silly beat business and listen?
This will take brains, not brawn.
You better believe it, and I'm loaded with both.
- Will you listen?
- Oh! Yeah, yeah.
Now, while you create a disturbance,
I'll rescue Mowgli.
- Got that?
- I'm gone, man.
- Solid gone!
- Not yet, Baloo!

How'd that square get in there?
Baloo! It's you!
[Roars]
[Laughing hysterically]
[Hooting, chattering]
[Shrieks]
Whew!
[Laughs]
Man, that's what I call a swingin' party!
And furthermore, Baloo,
Mowgli seems to have man's ability to get into trouble, and your influence hasn't been exactly...
Shh! Keep it down.
You're gonna wake up little buddy.
- [Bagheera groans]
- Well, he's had a big day.
It was a real sockeroo.
You know, it ain't easy learnin' to be like me.
Hah! A disgraceful performance.
Associating with those undesirable, scatterbrained apes?
[Scoffs] I hope Mowgli learned something from that experience.
[Sighs]
# Scooby-dooby-dooby
Dooby-doo #
Ha ha!
That's my boy.
Oh, nonsense.
[Bagheera] Baloo.
Over here. I'd like to have a word with you.
"A word"?
You gonna talk some more?
[Yawns]
All right, what's up, Bagheera?
Baloo, the man cub must go back to the man-village.
The jungle is not the place for him.
I grew up in the jungle.
Take a look at me.
Yes, just look at yourself.
Look at that eye.
Yeah.
It's beautiful, ain't it?
Frankly, you're a disreputable sight.
Well, you don't look exactly like a basket of fruit yourself.
Ohhh! [clears throat]
Uh, Baloo, you can't adopt Mowgli as your son.
Why not?
How can I put it?
Baloo, birds of a feather should flock together.
You wouldn't marry a panther, would you?
I don't know.
[Laughs] Come to think of it, no panther ever asked me.
Oh, Baloo, you've got to be serious about this.
Oh, stop worryin', Baggy.
Stop worryin'.
I'll take care of him.
Yes, like you did when the monkeys kidnapped him, huh?
- Can't a guy make one mistake?
- Not in the jungle.
And another thing, sooner or later
Mowgli will meet Shere Khan.
The tiger? What's he got against the kid?
He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.
Because he fears man's gun and man's fire.
But little Mowgli don't have those things.
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.
He'll get Mowgli while he's young and helpless.
Just one swipe and...
Ohh!
Well... Well, what are we gonna do?
We'll do what's best for the boy.
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.
Good. Then make Mowgli go to the man-village.
Are you out of your mind?
I promised him he could stay here in the jungle with me.
That's just the point.
As long as he remains with you, he's in danger.
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?
[Stammers] Because he won't listen to me.
I love that kid. [sniffles]
I love him like he was my own cub.
Then think of what's best for Mowgli and not yourself.
Uh, well, can't...
Can't I wait until morning?
It's morning now.
Go on, Baloo.
[Sighs]
Uh...
[sighs]
[Gasps]
Oh, boy.
Mowgli. Mowgli.
Uh, it's time to get up.
[Yawns] Oh. Hi, Baloo.
Hi.
Hey, rub that ol' sleep outta your eyes.
You and me, we got a long walk ahead of us.
Swell. Gee, we'll have lots of fun together.
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, all right, let's hit the trail, kid.
See ya around, uh, Bagheera.
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.
Me and Baloo, we've got things to do.
Goodbye, Man Cub...
...and good luck.
Come on, Baloo.
All we gotta do is...
# Look for the bare necessities
# Some good ol' bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
# I mean, the bare necessities
# That's why a bear
can rest at ease
# With just the bare
necessities of life
Yeah!
# I'll live here in the jungle
all my life #
Yeah, man! I like being a bear.
Where we goin', Baloo?
Well, uh, it's, uh... Um...
Well, it's sorta new and, uh...
Oh, I don't care, as long as I'm with you.
Mowgli, uh, look, buddy, uh, there's somethin' I gotta tell ya.
Tell me what, Baloo?
Oh, gee whiz.
Now, how did ol' Baggy put it?
It's, uh...
Uh, uh, Mowgli... [chuckles]
You wouldn't marry a panther, would ya?
[Laughing] Gee, I don't even know what you're talking about.
[Growls]
Mowgli, don't you realize that you're a human?
I'm not anymore, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo!
- Mowgli, stop it now. Hold still.
- [Growling]
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin' all morning to tell ya,
I've got to take you back to the man-village.
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!
That's goin' too far!
Hey, Mowgli! Where you goin'?
Wait a minute! Stop!
Wait!
Wait! Listen to ol' Baloo!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
Mowgli. Mowgli!
Now what's happened?
Well, y-you're not gonna believe me, Bagheera, but look, now, I used the same words you did, and he ran out on me!
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's separate. We've got to find him!
Oh, if anything happens to that little guy, I'll never forgive myself.
I gotta find him.
Mowgli!
Mowgli!
[Elephants trumpet]
# Hup, two, three, four
# Hup, two, three, four
# Keep it up, two, three, four
What beastly luck.
Confound that ridiculous Colonel Hathi.
Company... sound off!
# Oh, we march from here to there
# And it doesn't matter where
# You can hear us push
through the deepest bush
# Hup, two, three, four
[Hathi] # With a military air
[all] # With a military air
[trumpeting]
The jungle patrol!
# We're a crackerjack brigade
# On a pachyderm parade
# But we'd rather stroll
to a water hole
# Hup, two, three, four
[all] # For a furlough in the shade #
Stop!
Wait a minute. Halt!
- Ohh! Ohh!
- [Thudding]
Who said "halt"?
I give the commands around here.
Well, speak up. Who was it?
Oh, it was me, Colonel.
What do you mean, sir, taking over my command? Highly irregular, you know.
Oh, Colonel, I'm sorry, but I need your help.
[Hathi] Oh, absolutely impossible.
We're on a cross-country march.
[Bagheera] But it's an emergency,
Colonel.
- The man cub must be found.
- [Hathi] Man cub? What man cub?
How interesting.
The one I was taking to the man-village.
Good. That's where he belongs.
Now, sir, if you don't mind, we'd like to get on with the march.
[Bagheera] No, no, you don't understand, Hathi.
He is lost. He ran away.
How delightful.
Well, it serves the young whippersnapper right.
But... But Shere Khan, the tiger, is sure to pick up the man cub's trail.
[Chuckles]
Shere Khan. Nonsense, old boy.
Shere Khan isn't within miles of here.
[Chuckling]
Oh, sorry, Bagheera. Fortunes of war and all that sort of thing, you know.
This has gone far enough.
Far enough!
Now, just a minute, you pompous old windbag!
Winifred! What are you doing out of ranks?
Never mind.
How would you like to have our boy lost and alone in the jungle?
[Hathi] Our son... alone?
But, Winifred, old girl, that's an entirely different matter.
- [Scoffs]
- Different, entirely.
That little boy is no different than our own son.
Now you help find him or I'm taking over command.
What? A female leading my herd?
Utterly preposterous.
Pop, the man cub and I are friends.
He'll get hurt if we don't find him.
Please, Pop, sir? Please?
Now, don't you worry, son.
Your father had a plan in mind all the time.
[Scoffs] Sure you did.
[Sputtering] Troopers!
Company... left face!
Volunteers for a special mission will step one pace forward.
Ha ha! That's what I like to see.
Devotion to duty.
Now, you volunteers will find the lost man cub.
Oh, thank you, Colonel.
There's no time to lose.
Yes. Yes.
Uh, Bugler, when the man cub is sighted, you will sound your trumpet three times.
Yes, sir.
- [Trumpeting]
- [Hathi] Shh!
Not now, soldier.
[Nasal] Sorry, sir.
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be the element of surprise.
[Whispering] You will take one squad and cover the right flank.
[Lieutenant] Yes, sir.
[Whispering] And I shall meet the other squad on the left flank.
Very well.
[Shouting] Company...
[shout echoing]
...forward... march!
Element of surprise?
Oh, I say.
[Chuckling]
And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man cub.
Kaa! It's you!
Yes-s-s, Man Cub.
So nice to see you again.
[Giggling, hissing]
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.
Let me look at you.
You don't want me to look at you?
Then you look at me.
No, sir. I know what you're trying to do, Kaa.
You do?
Uh, I mean, you don't trust me.
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.
You want to help me?
[Hisses] Certainly.
I can see to it...
...that you never have to leave this jungle.
How could you do that?
Hmm?
Oh, I have my own...
...s- s-subtle little ways. [chuckles]
But first, you must trust me.
I don't trust anyone anymore.
I don't blame you.
I'm not like those so-called fair-weather friends of yours.
You can believe in me.
# Trust in me
# Just in me
# Shut your eyes
# And trust in me
Hold still, please.
# You can sleep
# Safe and sound
# Knowing I
# Am around
# Slip into silent slumber
# Sail on a silver mist
# Slowly and surely
# Your senses will cease to resist
[snoring]
You're snoring.
Sorry.
# Trust in me
# And just in me
# Shut your eyes
# And trust in me #
- [doorbell rings]
- Huh?
Oh, now what?
I'll be right down.
Yes? Yes? Who is it?
It's me, Shere Khan.
Uh, I'd like a word with you, if you don't mind.
Shere Khan.
What a s-s-surprise.
Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.
Oh, no, no. Nothing at all.
I thought perhaps you were entertaining someone up there in your coils.
Coils? Someone? Oh, no.
I was just curling up for my siesta.
But you were singing to someone.
- Who is it, Kaa?
- [Gulps] Uh, who?
[Coughs] Oh, no.
- I was just singing to myself.
- Indeed.
Yes. Yes, you see,
I have trouble with my s-s-sinuses.
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.
It's simply terrible. I can't eat.
I can't s-s-sleep, so I sing myself to sleep.
You know, self-hypnosis?
Let me show you how it works.
# Trust in me
- [muffled coughs]
- I can't be bothered with that.
I have no time for that sort of nonsense.
- [Hisses] Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.
But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.
"Man cub"? What man cub?
The one who's lost.
Now, where do you suppose he could be?
Search me.
That's an excellent idea. [chuckling]
I'm sure you wouldn't mind showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?
Uh, [hisses] certainly not.
Nothing here, and nothing in here.
[Snoring]
[Snorting]
My sinuses.
Hmm. Indeed.
And now, how about the middle?
The middle?
Oh, the middle.
[Laughing] Absolutely nothing in the middle.
Hmm.
Really?
Well, if you do just happen to see the man cub, you will inform me first.
- Understand?
- [Gulps] I get the point.
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.
And I must continue my search for the helpless little lad.
Ooh, who does he think he's fooling?
"Helpless little lad."
Ooh, he gives me the s-s-shivers.
Picking on that poor little helpless boy. [sighs]
Oh, yes.
The poor little helpless boy.
Aaah!
[Grunts, groans]
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.
It's like you said.
You can't trust anyone.
If I never see that skinny little shrimp again, it will be too soon.
Ooh, my s-s-sacroiliac.
[Thunder rumbling]
[Yawns]
Hey, Flaps. What we gonna do?
I don't know. What do you wanna do?
I've got it! Let's flap over to the east side of the jungle.
They've always got a bit of action, a bit of a swingin' scene.
Aw, come off it!
Things are right dead all over.
You mean you wish they were.
[Laughing]
[All laughing]
Very funny.
OK, so what we gonna do?
I don't know. What do you wanna do?
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do?"
"What we gonna do?"
"What you wanna do?"
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!
OK. What do you want to do?
Oh, blimey. There you go again.
The same notes again.
I've got it!
This time, I've really got it.
So you've got it.
So what we gonna do?
Hold it, lads.
Look. Look what's coming our way.
Hey, what in the world is that?
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.
Yeah, and they're all walking about by themselves.
[All laughing]
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.
Hey, now, don't start that again.
Come on, lads. Come on.
Let's have some fun with this little fella, this little bloke, eh?
Blimey! He's got legs like a stork, he has.
Like a stork. Ha ha!
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.
[Laughter]
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.
[Thunder rumbling]
What's wrong with him?
I think we overdid it.
We were just having a bit of fun, that's all.
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.
You know, he must be down on his luck.
Yeah, or he wouldn't be in our neighbourhood.
Hey, new kid! Wait a minute! Hey!
Just leave me alone.
Oh, come on. What's wrong?
You look like you haven't got a friend in the world.
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?
No. Nobody wants me around.
Yeah. We know how you feel.
Nobody wants us around either.
Oh, we may look a bit shabby, but we've got hearts.
And feelings too.
And just to prove it to you, we're going to let you join our little group.
Kid, we'd like to make you an honorary vulture.
Thanks, but I...
I'd rather be on my own alone.
Oh, now, look, kid.
Everybody's got to have friends.
Hey, fellas, are we his friends?
# We're your friends
[harmonizing]
# We're your friends
# We're your friends
to the bitter end
# The bitter end
# When you're alone
# When you're alone
# Who comes around
# Who comes around
# To pluck you up
- Give us a smile.
- # To pluck you up
# When you are down
# When you are down
# And when you're outside looking in
# Who's there to open the door?
- Come on, kid. We need a tenor.
- # That's
# What
# Friends are for
# Who's always eager to extend
# A friendly claw
# That's what friends are for
# And when you're lost
# In dire need
# Who's at your side
# At lightning speed
# We're friends with every creature
comin' down the pike
# In fact, we've never met
an animal we didn't like
Ha ha! You take it, kid.
# Didn't like
- # So, you can see we're friends
- # Friends in need
# We're friends in need
and friends indeed
# Friends indeed
- # Oh, friends indeed
- Whoops! Ooh!
- Easy, lads. Steady. Watch it!
- # We'll keep you safe in the jungle
# Forevermore
# That's what friends
# Are for #
Bravo. Bravo.
An extraordinary performance.
And thank you for detaining my victim.
Uh, don't mention it, Your Highness.
[Chuckling]
- Boo!
- [Sputtering, yelling]
- Let's get out of here.
- Gimme room! Gangway!
- [Thunder crashing]
- Run, friend! Run!
"Run"? Why should I run?
Why should you run?
Could it be possible that you don't know who I am?
I know you, all right.
- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.
Then you should also know that everyone runs from Shere Khan.
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.
Ah! You have spirit for one so small, and such spirit is deserving of a sporting chance.
Now, I'm going to close my eyes and count to ten.
It makes the chase more interesting... for me.
One...
...two, three...
...four...
You're trying my patience.
...five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
- [Thunder crashing]
- [Growling]
Run, Mowgli, run!
- Let go, you big oaf!
- Ooh!
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Whoa!
- [Growling]
- Yeow! Whoa, slow! Easy, now!
- [Growling]
- [Stammering] Whoa! Easy!
He's got a tiger by the tail, he has.
And he better hang on too.
- Yeow!
- Take that, you big bully.
Let him have it again, kid!
Hit him again, kid! Go on!
- Baloo! Help me!
- [Shere Khan roaring]
Ooh!
Woo-woo-wooo-wooo!
- [Thunder crashing]
- [Growling]
Somebody do something with that kid!
Come on, lads!
He's safe now! Ha ha ha!
You can let go, Baloo.
Are you kiddin'?
There's teeth in the other end.
[Snarling]
- Ooof!
- [Thud]
- I'll kill you for this. [growling]
- [Thunder crashing]
Let go! Baloo needs help!
Fire! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.
Oof!
[All] Charge!
- Punch and blow!
- Stay out of this, you mangy fools!
Yeah, yeah. Missed me a mile, he did!
[Vultures laughing]
- Yeah, pull his blinkin' whiskers!
- [Laughter]
He's a bloomin' pussycat, he is!
Look behind you, chum.
[Roaring]
[Snarling, roaring]
[Thunderclap]
- Well, that's the last of him.
- [Laughter]
[Laughter continues]
Old Stripes took off like a flaming comet, he did.
Well, come on. Let's go congratulate our friend.
Hold it, fellas.
Now is not the time for it. Look.
Baloo?
Baloo, get up.
Oh, please, get up.
[Sniffs] Oh.
Mowgli, try to understand.
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?
You've got to be brave, like Baloo was.
You... You don't mean...
Oh, no. Baloo.
[Sniffles]
Now, now. I know how you feel.
But you must remember, Mowgli,
"Greater love hath no one than he who lays down his life for his friend."
When great deeds are remembered in this jungle, one name will stand above all others:
Our friend, Baloo the bear.
[Sniffling] He's crackin' me up.
The memory of Baloo's sacrifice and bravery will forever be engraved on our saddened hearts.
Beautiful.
This spot where Baloo fell will always be a hallowed place in the jungle, for there lies one of nature's noblest creatures.
[Sniffling]
I wish my mother could have heard this.
It's best we leave now.
Come along, Man Cub.
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great!
There's more. Lots more!
Why, you big fraud!
[Stammers] You four-flusher!
I'm-I'm fed up! [sputtering]
- Baloo, you're all right!
- [Chuckles]
Who, me? Sure I am.
Never felt... better.
[Laughter]
- You sure had us worried.
- Aw, I was just takin' five.
You know, playin' it cool.
- [Chuckling] But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.
It's going to be a bit dull without the little bloke, isn't it?
Yeah. So what we gonna do?
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!
Hey, Baggy.
Too bad you missed the action.
You should have seen how I made a sucker out of Old Stripes with that left up in his face.
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him. "Wham!"
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.
- [Laughs] You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.
Nothing or nobody is ever gonna come between us again.
[Girl] # My own home
# My own home
# My own home
# My own home
- Look! What's that?
- [humming]
- Oh, it's the man-village.
- No, no. I mean that.
Forget about those.
They ain't nothing but trouble.
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.
So you've seen one. So let's go.
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.
- Mowgli, wait a minute!
- Oh, Baloo.
Let him have a better look.
[Humming continues]
# Father's hunting in the forest
# Mother's cooking in the home
# I must go to fetch the water
# Till the day that I am grown
# Till I'm grown
# Till I'm grown
# I must go to fetch the water
# Till the day that I am grown
[giggles]
# Then I will have a handsome husband
# And a daughter of my own
# And I'll send her to fetch the water
# I'll be cooking in the home
[humming]
# Then I'll send her to fetch the water
# I'll be cooking in my home #
Oh!
- She did that on purpose!
- Obviously.
[Humming]
Mowgli, come back. Come back.
Go on. Go on.
He's hooked.
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.
The boy couldn't help himself.
It was bound to happen.
Mowgli is where he belongs now.
Yeah.
I guess you're right.
But I still think he'd have made one swell bear.
Well, come on, Baggy, buddy.
Let's get back to where we belong.
And get with the beat.
- # Look for the bare necessities
- [grunts]
# The simple bare necessities
# Forget about your worries
and your strife
[both] # I mean the bare necessities
# Are Mother Nature's recipes
# That bring the bare necessities
of life #
Turn him over.
Oh, no!
"Do not drink wine nor strong drink...
"thou, nor thy sons with thee...
"lest ye shall die.
"Look not thou upon the wine when it is red...
"and when it bringeth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.
"At the last it biteth like a serpent...
"and stingeth like an adder."
Now, folks... that's from the Good Book... but in this here town... it's five cents a glass.
Five cents a glass.
Does anyone really think that that is the price of a drink?
The price of a drink? Let him decide... who has lost his courage and his pride... who lies a groveling heap of clay not far removed...
All's quiet, sir.
Let's fall in.
Follow me.
I beg your pardon, ma'am.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Allow me, ma'am.
Thank you.
May I?
Thank you.
Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!
Take a look.
I don't care what you meant to do... it's what you did I don't like.
You inconvenienced this lady, and made a fool of yourself... and this railroad in the bargain.
Now, I want you to apologize to this...
Yes, sir, can I help you?
If they move, kill them.
Is he with them?
He's there.
Hold your fire! Get down!
Wait till they come out.
I can nail him.
I said, wait!
What if they slip out the back way?
It's covered.
You two-bit redneck peckerwood.
Abe?
I solemnly promise...
God helping me...
"I solemnly promise, God helping me."
...to abstain from all distilled, fermented malt liquors... including wine, beer and cider.
"To abstain from liquor, wine, cider and beer."
People marching and singing, coming down the street.
They're gonna pass by the horses.
We'll join them.
The Temperance Union?
They should have been told.
Told what?
How long do you think anybody in this manure pile... could keep his mouth shut?
Yes, we'll gather at the river
The beautiful, beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
Rifles.
One?
No, three!
Maybe more, there, on the roof.
Get down.
Son of a bitch!
- Lyle, Dutch.
- What are they, bounty hunters?
Hell, I wouldn't know.
Buck, with Abe.
- I kill them now?
- No.
Hold them here as long as you can until after the shooting starts.
I'll hold them till hell freezes over or you say different.
When I kick him out, blast them.
We'll make a run for it.
C.L., give me that shotgun.
The beautiful, beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God
Set?
Let's go!
Good luck, boys!
They're blowing this town all to hell!
You're trash!
Now, you just hush now.
They was playing Gather at the River.
You know that one?
Sing it!
Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel feet have trod
Hurry!
River that flows by the throne of God
Come on, you lazy bastard!
I'm coming, damn it!
They've cleared out, for Christ's sake!
Let's go, T. C!
Put some more on!
Let's go!
Take him!
He's mine!
- He's mine!
- Mr. Harrigan.
He's mine!
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!
You just dig out that bullet and see if it ain't my.06!
You know I shot him.
You'd claim the whole thing, wouldn't you?
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Did he have any money?
Damn, I can't get his belt off!
You stupid, damn fools!
Why did you shoot this employee and let the others get away?
I didn't shoot that employee!
My first shot killed this man right here!
Liar!
He shot that employee while I was dropping this bandit and them others, too.
I must've killed all three of them.
Killed all three of them?
What were we doing up on that roof?
Liar! Black liar!
You shouldn't talk like that to me.
I'm sorry.
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.
I think this will do pretty good.
Harrigan!
Next time, you better plan the massacre more carefully, or I'll start with you.
Why didn't you kill Pike when you had the chance?
Stop!
Feathers flew like a turkey!
They shouldn't have run.
Say!
How'd you like to kiss my sister's black cat's ass?
This is better than a hog-killing!
Get them out of here!
We're holding you and your whole damn railroad responsible for this carnage!
- Mr. Benson...
- Innocent people are dead!
Women dying and mangled because you used our town as a battlefield!
You're going to pay! The railroad is going to pay for our loss of blood!
We were trying to catch a band of outlaws!
You lured that gang in here!
The railroad has been blabbing their mouth about a big payload for weeks!
We represent the law!
Pike, is that you?
I can ride, Pike.
I can ride.
I can't see, but I can ride.
God!
No!
I can't ride.
Finish it.
You boys want to move on, or stay and give him... a decent burial?
He was a good man.
I think we ought to bury him.
He's dead!
He's got a lot of good men back there to keep him company!
Too damn many!
I think the boys are right.
I'd like to say a few words for the dear, dead departed.
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!
Followed by a church supper... with a choir!
You crazy bastards, both of you!
Bishop, Engstrom, the Gorch brothers!
Amounts to a total of $4,500 and you let them ride out on you!
When the hard-money value of the men you killed... less my commission, adds up to $500!
Any one of those pelts would've not only cleared you with the company... but given you a bundle of money to raise hell with!
We'll do better next time!
We'll do anything you say, but we sure would appreciate liquor money for tonight.
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!
Get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!
If one of you tries to quit on me...
I'll pay a bonus of $1,000... to the man that kills him!
Let's pack it up then!
- Mr. Harrigan.
- Why should I let you go with them?
We've been over that.
You might run off with them.
Might even join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
What I like and what I need are two different things.
Listen, Mr. Harrigan.
I don't want to go back to prison, never again.
But it's got to be my way!
I need some good men!
You saw what happened out there this morning!
You'll use what you have and you'll see to it that it doesn't happen again... or I'll see you spend the rest of your life behind bars.
Try to run,
I'll be after you and so will they.
I gave you my word.
Well, we'll see what it's worth!
Six minutes.
Tell me, Mr. Harrigan, how does it feel... getting paid for it?
Getting paid to sit back and hire your killings with the law's arms around you?
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?
Good.
You dirty son of a bitch!
You've got 30 days to get Pike or 30 days back to Yuma.
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.
I want all of them back here, head down over a saddle.
Thirty days to get Pike or 30 days back to Yuma.
I don't see nothing so lindo about it.
Just looks like more of Texas as far as I'm concerned.
You have no eyes.
Got a half-hour of light. Let's go.
Hello, little fella.
- Them other fellas...
- They're not coming!
- None of them?
- No.
- But I got horses and saddles for them.
- We'll need them, they won't.
Now, about the sharing up.
The sharing up will be the same as always.
Well, me and Tector don't think that he ought to get the same amount.
He's just starting out, and this is mine and Tector's opening for a new territory.
That's right.
And I figure a share to that old goat for watching them horses... is damn sure a share too much.
So, we decided... it ain't fair.
If you two boys don't like equal shares, why in the hell don't you just take all of it?
Well, why don't you answer me, you damned, yellow-livered trash?
Now, Pike, you know damn well...
I don't know a damned thing except that
I either lead this bunch or end it right now.
All right.
We divide it up just like you say.
Chick, chick, chick, chick.
Silver rings.
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!
Bastards!
Washers!
Washers!
We shot our way out of that town for a dollar's worth of steel holes!
They set it up!
They? Who in the hell is "they"?
"They?"
Why, "they" is just plain and fancy "they."
That's who "they" is.
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!
Led you in and waltzed you out again!
Oh, my, what a bunch!
Big tough one!
Here you are with a handful of holes, a thumb up your ass... and a big grin to pass the time of day with.
"They!"
Who the hell is "they"?
Railroad men.
Bounty hunters.
Deke Thornton.
Deke Thornton?
He was one of them?
How the hell come you didn't know that?
Hey, gringo.
You can have my silver.
Come on, gringo, don't kill me.
You can have the silver.
But don't kill me.
Please?
Go on... go for it.
Fall apart.
Walk softly, boys.
What's our next move?
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.
Three days, maybe.
We'll get the news and drift to the border.
Maybe a payroll, maybe a bank.
Maybe that damn railroad!
That damn railroad you're talking about sure as hell ain't getting no easier.
And you boys ain't getting any younger, either.
We gotta start thinking beyond our guns.
Those days are closing fast.
All your fancy planning and talking damn near got us shot to pieces... over a few lousy bags of washers.
Well, this was going to be me and Tector's last job before we quit and headed south!
We spent all our time and money getting ready for this!
You spent all your time and money running whores in Hondo... while I spent my stake setting it up!
Hell, I should have been running whores instead of stealing army horses!
While you was doing all that planning... me and Tector was getting our bell rope pulled by two... two, mind you, Hondo whores!
And Pike was dreaming of washers!
He was.
You were matching whores... in tandem!
What's that?
That's one behind the other.
That's right! That's what we was doing!
Mr. Thornton?
You rode with Pike.
What kind of man are we up against?
The best.
He never got caught.
This was going to be my last.
Ain't getting around any better.
I'd like to make one good score and back off.
Back off to what?
Have you got anything lined up?
Pershing's got troops spread out all along the border.
Every one of those garrisons are gonna be getting a payroll.
That kind of information is kind of hard to come by.
I didn't say it's going to be easy, but it can be done.
He'll be waiting for us.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Come on, Pike, let's go.
You sound like you're all caught up.
Caught up enough to know we've overstayed our welcome.
What the hell's the matter with you?
We've got plenty of money to spend, and not a worry in the world.
They're not going to look for us in their own backyard.
How can you be so damn sure?
Being sure is my business.
Being sure is my business.
- Hold it!
- Relax.
It's just some champagne we ordered.
Relax. It's just some champagne we ordered.
Being sure is my business.
Did you get him?
No, the bastard got away.
Damn, you sure must have hurt that railroad.
They spent a lot of money setting up that ambush.
I caught up with them.
Two or three times.
There was a man named Harrigan.
He used to have a way of doing things.
I made him change his ways.
And a hell of a lot of people... that just can't stand to be wrong.
Pride.
And they can't forget it.
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.
How about us, Pike?
You reckon we learned... being wrong today?
I sure hope to God we did.
Them's hot.
Damn!
Where in the hell did you ever find him?
He used to run with Thornton and me.
Did his share of killing, and more.
Around Langtry.
Yeah, only now he does his killing with a coffee cup.
Pike...
I wouldn't have it any other way either.
Watch out, boys!
Go on, easy.
Watch it, Tector!
That goddamned son of a bitch!
Get those horses up!
What the hell is going...
Damned old punk! Bastard!
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!
Get over here!
What in the hell's the matter with you, old man?
Leave him alone!
He's going to get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.
You're not getting rid of anybody! We're gonna stick together, like it used to be.
When you side with a man, you stay with him.
And if you can't do that, you're like some animal!
You're finished!
We're finished! All of us!
Mount up.
Appears Brother Pike needs help,
Brother Lyle.
That Brother Pike and the old man Sykes... makes a man wonder if it ain't time... to pick up his chips and find another game.
How in the hell are you going to side anybody... when you can't even get on your horse?
That was a mighty fine talk you gave the boys back there about sticking together.
That Gorch came near killing me.
Or me him.
Damned old fool like me's not worth taking along!
- We started together, we'll end it together.
- By God, that's the way I see it.
That's the way it's always been with me.
Sorry about Deke.
I never figured him that way.
Say, back there in Starbuck... how did my boy do?
Your boy?
Crazy Lee?
Yes, C.L., Clarence Lee.
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.
I kill them now? I kill them now?
No, you just hold them here.
Hold them here.
Why didn't you tell me he was your grandson?
You had enough things on your mind.
Besides, he had to pull his own weight just like the rest of us.
I just wanted to make sure he didn't let you down, run, when things got hot.
No, he did fine.
Just fine.
All clear!
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.
What's the closest town of any size?
Agua Verde.
What's in Agua Verde?
Mexicans, what else?
A headquarters for regulars fighting against Villa.
Mapache territory.
Don't we follow?
No, we go back and wait.
- Damn it! Go find...
- Shut up!
Why in the hell won't you tell your folks to feed them dogs?
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.
I have invited you to my village, to my home.
Any disrespect to my family or to my people...
I will kill you.
Ashamed of having us meet your people?
Yes. They don't know about my life when I leave the village.
- You got a sister?
- Yes.
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance.
And that of your mama too.
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.
How bad did they hit you?
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they give you any protection?
They were federal troops... commissioned by the traitor, Huerta.
And the soldier who shot my father?
What was his name?
- What the hell difference does it make?
- Your father died like a man.
Names in this matter do not have any importance.
How was he called?
Mapache.
That is name enough.
In Mexico, señor... these are the years of sadness.
But if we had... rifles like these...
And Teresa? Did they molest her?
She went with them because she wished to.
She became the woman of Mapache... and the others.
She went with them, laughing.
Drunk with wine and love.
To him, Teresa was like a goddess, to be worshipped from afar.
I tell you, she was a mango... ripe and waiting.
Angel dreams of love and Mapache eats the mango.
That's a good trick.
Now that I find hard to believe.
Not so hard.
We all dream of being a child again.
Even the worst of us.
Perhaps the worst most of all.
You know what we are, then?
Yes, just so, the both of you!
And you!
Where is Mapache?
All right, Pike? All right?
Tector, let's swap!
Come on, let's swap!
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?
Why do you wish to know?
For your father?
Or the whore?
Either you learn to live with it or we'll leave you here.
I go with you, Jefe.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna steal his girl.
You are?
Here I go.
Dutch, I'm cutting in.
Come on, lady!
No gringos?
Only federales.
All soldiers.
Not a bounty hunter in sight.
Now, what in the hell is that?
I saw one just like it in Waco.
Run on steam?
No, on alcohol or gasoline.
Hey, Pike, you know what I hear?
I hear they got one of those things up north that can fly.
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.
No, the old man's right.
They've got motors and wings and go 60 miles in less than an hour.
Going to use them in the war they say.
Well, let's go and talk to the General... about his automobile and our extra horses.
Nice and easy.
Probably talking about us behind our backs.
I'm down to about twenty in silver.
With the way the Generalísimo's cleaned out this part of the country... he ought to have a lot to spare.
Generalísimo, hell.
He's just another bandit grabbing all he can for himself.
Like some others I could mention.
Not so as you'd know it, Mr. Bishop.
We ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.
I hope someday these people here kick him... and the rest of the scum like him right into their graves.
We will.
If it takes forever!
Look here.
Pretty good-looking old pony, ain't he?
Boy, do you know them beauties?
Come on.
- She was my woman.
- I know.
Sure ain't your woman no more.
Just look at her licking inside that general's ear.
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.
He went a little crazy when he saw her with you.
Are you men associated with the American Army?
No, we're not associated with anybody.
I see.
I was curious about the equipment which you are carrying. That pistol... is restricted for the use of army personnel.
It can't be purchased or even owned... legally.
- Is that so?
- Weapons are a specialty of mine.
I am Commander Frederick Mohr of the Imperial German Army.
It would be very useful for us if we knew of some Americans... who did not share their government's naive sentiments.
Well, we share very few sentiments with our government.
He's asking us to have a drink with him.
Good.
Shoot him.
I gave it to him, T.C.
- You mean here?
- No, no, not there!
Wait a minute, now, what you going to do?
We got to show a little class here.
Right here!
It must be that garrison rail spur.
I know it's the easiest to hit, but I gotta figure some way to get it out of there.
What do you think, Dutch?
Getting pretty close to home, ain't it?
Look at them gathered around that big table.
Here we sit like kitchen help.
Why do you want us to hit a train like that at the border?
Can't the General just go up there and take over the whole thing?
General Huerta is anxious to better relations with the United States... not to cross the border and destroy them.
Usually these arms shipments are kept pretty secret.
How'd you find out about this one?
Mapache has a superb intelligence force... organized under supervision of my commanding officer.
Now, gentlemen, we are quite well organized... and able to pay $10,000... in gold.
Of course, if you're not able to do the work, we'll find someone else.
We can do it. It's just that we're going to need special equipment.
Do not worry.
Our accountant will take care of everything.
General... soon you will be the best-equipped general in Mexico.
Well, look here... ain't he the one?
To the host!
With your permission, I need a bath.
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.
I don't need no bath!
What me and Tector need is a couple of them women you're hogging.
You think you can fix that up for us?
Gentlemen, you will excuse me, I'm sure.
I'm sure.
- Herrera.
- Let's get Angel.
Por favor, General, I need him.
I'll give you someone much better than that.
If you don't mind, I'll make my own choice.
All right.
He is not important to me. Take him.
I think we're gonna get on the wagon now.
Hey, here come our sweeties.
Ain't them pretty?
I don't know about yours, Lyle, but...
I think I got more than I can handle.
Hey, get out of there.
You know what they told me?
The dons of Spain built this over 300 years ago.
- Is that right?
- That's right.
I tell you, Lyle, I'm all for them dons.
Let's have a little target.
She ain't going to get away.
Turn her loose.
Why not!
Tector, look at them beauties!
How in the hell can you stand it that hot?
I'm going to build me one of these some day and live in it.
Hell, Lyle, look here.
Come on, sweetheart, let me see your teatsies.
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.
Listen, I'm not going to steal guns for that devil to rob and kill my people again.
Noble, noble. Very noble.
I didn't see no tears rolling down your cheeks when you rode in from Starbuck.
They were not my people.
I care about my people, my village.
Listen, boy, you ride with us, your village don't count.
If it does, you just don't go along.
Then I don't go along.
Angel, one load of guns ain't going to stop them raiding villages.
Why, you ought to be thinking about all the money you're gonna have.
Buy them a ranch. Move them 1,000 miles.
- Buy them two or three ranches.
- One.
A very small one.
Don't you see? This is their land.
No one is going to drive them away.
I'll drink to that sentiment.
And to love.
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!
Angel.
You're a pain in the ass.
Would you give guns to someone to kill your father... or your mother, or your brother?
Ten thousand cuts an awful lot of family ties.
My people have no guns.
But with guns... my people could fight.
If I could take guns...
I would come with you.
Say, how many cases of rifles did Zamorra say was in that shipment?
Sixteen.
Well... give him one.
All right.
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.
I will.
- We know you will.
- Sure glad we got that settled.
Why, you reprobate!
Boys...
I want you to meet my fiancée.
They just got engaged.
I'm a son of a bitch!
Trot them on in, fellas.
I'm hell on packing mules, but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.
You want to gamble everything that this one shipment will be attacked?
If they're in Agua Verde, they'll try for it.
- If? What about Juarez?
- If he was, we would've heard about it.
If they are in Agua Verde, they will have seen Mapache.
And who in the hell is Mapache?
A killer for Huerta who calls himself a general.
He's been fighting Villa and losing.
But with enough guns, he could become a power in northern Mexico.
My guess is,
Pike will try to get them for him.
How can he? The train will be guarded by regular troops.
Not regular troops, green recruits not worth a damn.
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.
And not this gutter trash you've given me.
What you've got is 24 more days.
Never told me how you got all torn up like that.
I met a woman I wanted to marry.
- Is your husband coming back?
- No.
He's never coming back.
But you are late.
Two days late.
She had a husband.
If I'd had any sense, I'd have killed him.
He wasn't around.
I got careless.
One night, he walked in on us.
Got her with the first shot, and got me here with the second.
Then the damn coward turned and ran.
Ever catch up with him?
No, but there isn't a day or an hour that passes that I don't think about it.
Come on, pretty! We've got a long way!
This is our last go around, Dutch.
This time, we do it right.
Just do your work.
Let's go!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Faster!
Get over!
Get that ramp up!
Get that horse out of here!
Bring them all out! Get them out!
Get over here!
Get them over here! Get those horses!
Hurry up!
Your horse kicked me.
Run them up along here!
Where the hell is my horse?
Hey, we got grenades!
- Hurry up! We gotta get out of here!
- Be careful with this, boys!
Let's go on this.
Here we go.
All right, line up in a column of twos!
Corporal, give us a hand here!
Hey, Pike, we're all ready!
Let's go!
Come on!
Get after that horse!
That was my horse!
Get after him!
You men get out!
Get that damn horse off my butt!
Get those horses out of here!
The train's coming back!
Train?
- Where?
- What train?
I don't see any train.
Get the goddamn horse off my foot!
Corporal, ride back to the telegraph at Todos Malos... and tell the railroad deputies they robbed the train... and we're in pursuit!
Yes, sir!
Come on!
Dutch!
Damn son of a...
Come on! It's lit!
Get them horses going!
Don't shoot at the army, you idiots!
Come on, Pike!
Let's go!
Come on, you lazy bastard!
I'm coming, damn it!
- Is it all right?
- Yep.
Where are they supposed to meet us?
Agua Verde or before.
But when we do meet them, don't expect any open arms.
Least we won't have to worry about Deke Thornton.
Hell, no. Not after riding a half a case of dynamite into the river.
Don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along and you know it.
I sure would like to get hold of that fool horse of mine.
Some Mex kid's probably riding him home right now.
I don't see how I could've lost both my boots.
They always were hard as hell to get on.
That damn river sucked them right off.
That damn dynamite helped some.
Maybe the same kid that's riding T.C.'s horse is wearing your boots right now.
You stupid bastards!
Why did you fire at those soldiers?
Huey started firing at them.
I even tried to stop him.
- One of the bandits...
- Don't blame it on me!
Liar!
Shut your mouths!
Are we going after them?
We are, unless you want to face a firing squad.
Come on, T. C!
Why the hell do we have to leave now?
Besides, my hair's wet!
Impossible! We have no arms or ammunition.
The gringos assaulted the train!
They got the guns.
We must go!
Take the necessary people and take the road to Agua Verde.
Convince the gringos to give you the guns.
I'll wait for you in the village.
If the gringos refuse?
He's still heading east.
Are they bluffing, or did they really miss it?
I'd say they missed it. Here, take a look.
There's only five left.
- Hell, we lost them.
- I don't see how we lost them.
Unless it was in the big valley where the ground was hard.
Wasn't but one way they could take a wagon out of there, and this here is it.
They didn't take it out.
And we haven't lost them.
I could point to them right now.
Sit still, damn it!
You think Pike and old Sykes haven't been watching us?
They know what this is all about.
And what do I have?
Nothing but you egg-sucking, chicken-stealing gutter trash... with not even 60 rounds between you.
We're after men.
And I wish to God I was with them.
The next time you make a mistake,
I'm gonna ride off and let you die.
Come on.
I never figured they'd come down here after us.
How much you reckon we could be worth?
Depends on how hungry they are.
You better stay here and look out for big hats.
I'll go down and start rigging the fireworks.
All right.
Angel... get that case of explosives off the back there!
Lyle... hand me down those blasting caps.
What're you gonna do with the dynamite?
I figure that damn general will try to take this load without paying for it... and shoot us in the bargain.
The only thing to change his mind is if something happened to these guns.
I'm gonna make sure something could happen.
Pike, take a look at this.
Think you can handle that?
What I don't know about,
I sure as hell am going to learn.
My people are here for their guns.
Where the hell were you when you were supposed to be guarding us.
I never heard them, didn't even see them.
They apologize and ask you to forgive them for their lack of trust.
But only by caution do they remain alive.
Tell them not to break that fuse.
These people from your village?
They are part of the village, but not from it.
They are puro Indio and these mountains belong to them.
I'd say those fellows know how to handle themselves.
They've been fighting Apaches for 1,000 years. That's a sure way to learn.
If they ever get armed, with good leaders, this whole country will go up in smoke.
That it will, son. That it will.
They made damn fools out of us,
Mr. Bishop.
Getting so a fella can't sleep with both eyes closed... for fear of getting his throat cut.
Where in the hell were you?
Now, you listen to me, Lyle.
If you got up off your ass and helped once in a while...
I wouldn't have got caught near so easy.
With the new guns and ammunition, this could never have happened.
Swing your leaders wide, old man!
Bring them on!
Come on, horse!
- Hold up!
- Whoa there!
Mapache's?
Let's just hope they don't belong to Villa.
We are friends.
We are from el General Mapache.
Tell the one out in front to come over here.
Alone.
I am coming.
I am your friend, remember?
We are friends. All of us.
I bring you love and affection from el General.
You bring the guns with you?
What bravery you have done!
I am to escort you to the General.
- Tell him to come closer.
- I hear.
I am coming, my friend.
You know what this is?
Any trouble, no guns for the General.
Very smart!
That's very smart for you damn gringos.
So nobody can rob the guns.
Nobody.
I am not afraid. They are not afraid.
You blow up the wagon, you die.
Or we kill you pretty soon.
- But we are amigos.
- Show them, boys.
Start the ball, Tector.
Please, cut the fuse.
Please.
El General waits in Agua Verde to meet with you.
Tell the General one of us will be there to trade tomorrow.
Any trouble, no guns.
Damn gringos!
Get them up there, Freddie!
Pull them over!
You bring the guns?
Don't worry, we've got them.
Hidden.
When I get my share of the gold,
$2,500 worth...
I'll tell you where four cases are.
The others are waiting for me back at the wagon.
If I don't show up pretty quick, they'll blow it.
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fooled me.
Our accountant will pay you immediately.
When do we get our guns?
The quicker I get back, the quicker you get the next load.
Open it up.
Up the arroyo, about two miles... you'll find three cases of rifles... and one case of ammunition hidden in the bush behind them.
I understand you have a machine gun.
Our contract called for 16 cases of rifles... and ammunition for $10,000.
Not a machine gun.
That's our present to the General.
Gringo, you fight with Mapache...
I'll think about it.
In case he don't find them...
Go. I trust him.
- Why the hell don't you stir up some grub?
- Why don't you go to hell?
Shit!
Damn it!
Damn it, Pike must've found you under a rock.
You gonna whip me?
Nope.
But you better just hope
I don't get riled enough... to start dogging you when this is over.
You're not going to get a chance to dry gulch me, old man.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Pike's coming!
He's got it. Carrying gold.
Any trouble?
Just from carrying this weight.
- Pike, I want to go next.
- All right.
You and your brother take the next load, along with the machine gun.
Then Angel and Dutch. Freddie, you follow and pick up the pack horses.
It must be mounted on a tripod!
It must be mounted on a tripod!
Crazy bastards!
Put it on the tripod!
We brought the last of it, General.
At the head of the arroyo, in the wagon.
You can have the wagon, we'll take the horses.
How many cases did you take from the train?
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.
He stole it.
The mother of the girl he killed told me so.
Well, I'm wasting time here.
He's a thief. You take care of him.
Well, he had guts.
We're just lucky he didn't talk.
He played his string right out to the end.
Her own mama turned him in like some kind of a Judas.
Sykes says we ought to go after him.
How in the hell are we gonna do that?
They got guns and 200 men.
No way.
No way at all.
Is that Sykes?
Mapache!
Thornton.
I got him.
They got Freddie.
Looks like he's hit pretty bad.
Damn that Deke Thornton to hell!
What would you do in his place?
He gave his word.
Gave his word to a railroad.
It's his word!
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to!
We can stay up here and kick hell out of them!
That's what we can do.
No, we're running short of water.
Make a run for the border?
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.
I'm tired of being hunted.
Let's go back to Agua Verde.
Let the General take care of those boys.
You're crazy.
That general would just as soon kill us as break wind.
He's so tickled with those guns... he'll be celebrating for a week and happy to do us a favor.
Thornton's not gonna follow us in there.
While they're busy picking over Freddie... we'll find a back trail off this mountain and head for town.
What about our gold?
We'll take one sack to pay our way.
Bury the rest.
Together.
Look out!
Lots of blood, then it stops. No track.
- $10 says he's dead by now.
- Take us a day to find him if he is.
If he isn't, he has a gun on us right now.
Let's go after the others.
Just leave him here? He's worth money.
Yes, you ride out tomorrow, that is if you can stay on your horse... and watch the buzzards.
They'll show you where he is.
What if he ain't dead, Mr. Thornton?
That's your problem. Let's go!
- God, I hate to see that.
- No more than I do.
Welcome, amigos!
You come for your friend, no?
I want to buy him back.
I don't think he looks worth too much.
I don't think he's going to live too long.
I'll give you half of my share for him.
I need no gold and I don't sell this one.
Why not? You've had your fun with him.
El Generalísimo's happy with the guns.
Why don't you go and get a drink?
Enjoy yourself.
There are women everywhere.
Don't be foolish and change his mood.
Son of a bitch!
Why not?
There ain't nobody here!
There's wagon tracks and somebody was here!
They sure as hell ain't here now!
Army patrol!
Coming this way!
You said dos for two!
Here's your dos and one to grow on.
That's all you're gonna get out of me.
Let's go.
Why not?
What do you want?
We want Angel.
You want Angel, no? All right.
I'm going to give him to you.
Bitch!
Come on, you lazy bastard!
Give them hell, Pike!
No, Pike!
Pike.
Pike.
Look at them.
- Come on.
- I'm coming.
Wait for me!
- Come on, let's get all the guns.
- This is fine!
This is just like a big old picnic!
Here's a rifle for you.
He's got a gun.
T.C., it's them!
It's the Gorches!
Get up there, Coffer. Come on.
Mr. Thornton, it's them.
It is them.
Here's a boy's got some gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.
- Here.
- Let me see your knife!
Mr. Thornton.
Should we load up?
Are we going to wait for Jess or meet him on the way?
If he's waiting for them buzzards to lead him to old Sykes, he's got a long wait.
Look! We got them all.
T.C., there he is.
There's Pike.
There, you ain't so damned much now, are you, Mr. Pike?
You ain't coming?
No.
Maybe we ought to wait here for Jess.
No, we pick him up on the way.
I want to get out of this damn place.
Anyway, these boys'll start going ripe on us by tomorrow.
We got to move.
I went to the river and I couldn't get across
Singing 'polly wolly doodle'all the day
I jumped on a buzzard 'cause
I thought he was a horse
Singing 'polly wolly doodle'all the day
Fare thee well
- Didn't expect to find you here.
- Why not?
I sent them back.
- That's all I said I'd do.
- They didn't get very far.
I figured.
What are your plans?
Drift around down here.
Try to stay out of jail.
Well, me and the boys here... we got some work to do.
You want to come along?
Ain't like it used to be, but it'll do.
English
And that completes my final report until we reach touchdown.
We're now on full automatic, in the hands of the computers.
I've tucked my crew in for the long sleep and I'll be joining them soon.
In less than an hour we'll finish our sixth month out of Cape Kennedy.
Six months in deep space.
By our time, that is.
According to Dr. Hasslein's theory of time in a vehicle traveling nearly the speed of light, the Earth has aged nearly 700 years since we left it, while we've aged hardly at all.
It may be so.
This much is probably true.
The men who sent us on this journey are long since dead and gone.
You who are reading me now are a different breed.
I hope a better one.
I leave the 20th century with no regrets, but... one more thing.
If anybody's listening, that is.
Nothing scientific. It's... purely personal.
Seen from out here, everything seems different.
Time bends.
Space is... boundless.
It squashes a man's ego.
I feel lonely.
That's about it.
Tell me, though...
Does man, that marvel of the universe, that glorious paradox who has sent me to the stars, still make war against his brother, keep his neighbor's children starving?
Are you all right?
Stewart?
We're in the soup!
She's sinking!
Dodge, read the atmosphere!
Landon, get out a last signal!
What signal?
To Earth! That we've landed!
The air's OK!
Blow the hatch before we lose all our power!
It's no use! The power's gone!
Forget it! Abandon ship!
She's sinking.
Going...
Gone.
OK. We're here to stay.
Well, where are we?
Do you have any notion, skipper?
We're some 320 light years from Earth on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion.
Is that close enough for you?
That could be Bellatrix.
It's too white for Bellatrix.
You didn't have time to read the tapes.
So you really don't know, do you?
What went wrong?
We weren't programmed to land in the water.
The question is not so much where we are as when we are.
We've had enough sleep to hold us for a while.
Let's start earning all that back pay.
Dodge, run your soil test.
- Got your sensors?
- Right.
- Geiger counter?
- Got it.
Let's see. One pistol,
20 rounds ammo, a medical kit, camera, TX9.
We've got food and water enough for three days.
How long is a day?
That's a good question.
Landon!
Hey, Landon!
Join the expedition.
Sorry. I was thinking about Stewart.
What do you suppose happened?
Air leak. She died in her sleep.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
It's a little late for a wake.
She's been dead nearly a year.
That means we've been away from Earth for 18 months.
Our time.
You've gone gray.
Apart from that you look pretty chipper for a man who's 2,031 years old.
I read the clocks.
They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis.
We have been away from Earth for 2,000 years, give or take a decade.
Still can't accept it?
Time's wiped out everything you ever knew.
It's all dust.
Prove it.
If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
It's a fact, Landon.
Buy it. You'll sleep better.
Nothing will grow here.
There's just a trace of carbohydrates.
All the nitrogen is locked into the nitrates.
No dangerous ionization?
No.
Well...
If there's no life here, we've got just 72 hours to find it.
That's when the groceries run out.
Let's go.
Which direction?
That way.
Any particular reason?
None at all.
Come on...
Everybody all right?
Water check.
Eight ounces.
It doesn't add up.
Thunder and lightning, and no rain.
Cloud cover at night.
That strange luminosity... yet there's no moon.
If we could just get a fix.
What would that tell you?
I've told you where you are and when you are.
All right, all right.
You're 300 light years from your precious planet.
Your loved ones are dead and forgotten for 20 centuries.
Even if you could get back, they'd think you were something that fell out of a tree.
Taylor, quit riding him.
There is just one reality.
We are here and it is now.
You get hold of that, or you might as well be dead.
I'm prepared to die.
He's prepared to die.
Doesn't that make you misty?
Chalk up another victory for the human spirit.
Clue me in on something, will you?
Why did you sign on for this trip?
You volunteered. Why?
Never mind. I'll clue you in.
You were the golden boy of the class of '72.
When they nominated you for the big one, you couldn't turn it down.
Not without losing your all-American image.
Climb off, will you?
Oh, and the glory. Don't forget that.
There's a life-size bronze statue of you standing out there somewhere.
It's probably turned green by now and nobody can read the nameplate.
But never let it be said that we forget our heroes.
Taylor, I'm telling you to climb off my back.
And there's one last item.
Immortality.
You wanted to live for ever, didn't you?
Well, you damn near made it.
Except for me and Dodge, you've lived longer than anyone ever born.
And with our lovely Lieutenant Stewart dead, it looks like you're the last of the line.
You got what you wanted, tiger.
How does it taste?
OK. You read me well enough.
But why can't I read you?
Don't bother.
Dodge, there. He's not like me at all.
But he makes sense.
He'd walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something that no other man knew.
But you... You're no seeker.
You're negative.
- And I'm not prepared to die.
- I'd like to know why not.
You thought life on Earth was meaningless.
You despised people.
So what did you do? You ran out.
No, no. It's not like that, Landon.
I'm a seeker too.
But my dreams aren't like yours.
I can't help thinking somewhere in the universe there has to be something better than man. Has to be.
Taylor, over here!
Life.
Where there's one, there's another.
And another and another.
Let's find 'em.
Skipper!
Look!
Scarecrows?
Let's see.
To hell with the scarecrows!
Taylor!
Look at this.
Taylor, look!
They didn't leave much, did they?
Well, at least they haven't tried to bite us.
Blessed are the vegetarians.
They look more or less human, but I think they're mute.
We got off at the wrong stop.
You're supposed to be the optimist, Landon.
Look on the bright side.
If this is the best they've got around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Smile.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?
This one.
Will he live?
I don't know.
This beast has lost a lot of blood.
There's no probe here. Find one!
Yes, sir.
This place is dirty, doctor.
Doctor, these animals are dirty. They stink and they carry communicable diseases.
Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
You don't sound happy in your work.
I'm little more than a vet in this laboratory.
You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius about me.
I did. You know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees.
But the quota system's been abolished.
- You made it. Why can't I?
- What do you mean - made it?
I'm an animal psychologist, that's all.
We have no authority.
You do all right when it comes to getting space and equipment.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here in studies of cerebral functions of these animals.
They're still dirty, doctor.
And their bite is septic.
There. Look at that.
Hold his jaw.
- Good morning, Dr. Zira.
- Good morning, Julius.
- How's our patient today?
- No change.
The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
Well!
And what do we want this morning?
Do we want something? Come on. Speak.
Come on.
Speak.
Do we want some sugar, old-timer?
You could get hurt doing that, doctor.
Oh, don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
They're all tame until they take a chunk out of you.
Well, Bright Eyes.
Is our throat feeling better?
Still hurts, doesn't it?
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
That Bright Eyes is remarkable.
He keeps trying to form words.
You know what they say.
Human see, human do.
Now what?
He seems to want something.
I'd be careful, doctor.
What did I tell you?
Try that again and I'll break your arm!
Good morning, Your Excellency.
Dr. Zaius.
Good morning, sir.
Open up, please.
I'm so glad you could come.
Sir, he's over here.
Bright Eyes...
Show him. Go ahead.
Do your trick.
Speak.
Go on. Speak again.
There! Can you believe it?
Yes, amusing.
A man acting like an ape.
Dr. Zaius,
I could swear he's answering you.
He has a definite gift for mimicry.
Most unusual.
He's using that old blanket as clothing.
I wonder how he'd score on a Hopkins manual dexterity test.
An animal?
Look!
He's moving his fingers.
Only because he saw you moving yours.
But perhaps he understood.
Man has no understanding.
He can be taught a few simple tricks.
Nothing more.
I'm afraid I must disagree.
- According to my experiments...
- Dr. Zira, I must caution you.
Experimental brain surgery on these creatures is one thing, and I'm all in favor of it.
But your behavioral studies are something else again.
To suggest that we can learn anything about the simian nature from the study of man is sheer nonsense.
Besides, man is a nuisance.
He eats up his food supplies in the forest, then migrates to our green belts and ravages our crops.
The sooner he is exterminated the better.
It's a question of simian survival.
Is this the one you wanted, doctor?
Oh, yes. Thank you.
Bright Eyes, I've got a present for you.
Put her in with him.
Cornelius! Up here.
Do you have to work tonight?
No.
Neither do I.
Oh, Cornelius.
There's Bright Eyes.
The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
Watch.
Hello, Bright Eyes.
How's our throat today?
- Look! She remembers!
- Remembers what?
The blood transfusion.
Zira, really!
You know, they can't... Watch out.
Here comes number one.
Something's bothering him.
He's been prying around the lab for the last two days.
Good morning, Dr. Zaius.
- You know my... Dr. Cornelius, my fiancé.
- Of course.
The young ape with a shovel.
I hear you're planning another archaeological expedition.
- With the Academy's approval, sir.
- The project will require my support.
I hope I may count on it, sir.
Cornelius, a friendly warning.
As you dig for artifacts, be sure you don't bury your reputation.
Guard!
Stop!
You'll hurt him!
Take him inside.
Cornelius! Cornelius, if you have a moment today,
I'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.
Certainly, sir. I'll pick up my notes and I'll come right over.
I don't understand these animal psychologists.
What's Dr. Zira trying to prove?
That man can be domesticated.
- What happened?
- Oh, those fools and their torches.
- Do you have any ointment?
- I'll see.
I'm sorry, Bright Eyes.
Julius!
I told you what you'd get!
Julius, don't, don't, don't!
It doesn't matter!
Julius, don't hurt him!
Julius!
Natural-born thieves, aren't they?
Get me a collar and leash.
- I'm taking him out of here.
- He's vicious, doctor.
- Besides, it's against the rules.
- Do as I say!
You... you wouldn't hurt me, would you,
Taylor?
It's a stunt.
Humans can't write.
Dear, you're a scientist.
Don't you believe your own eyes?
Where did you learn to do this?
"Jefferson
Public School."
"Fort Wayne,
Indiana."
Back on that planet you say you came from?
Maybe he is intelligent.
But he is also... crazy.
Cornelius.
Cornelius, please.
"Dodge was killed in the hunt."
"What happened to... Landon?"
I don't know.
They fell out of the sky with you?
"Not fell. Flew."
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
And even if it weren't, why fly?
Where would it get you?
"Do you have maps?"
We're here. You were captured here.
You fell into the water here?
You came ashore...
Marched across the desert?
Mountains?
Many days and nights.
And reached the jungle.
Out of the question.
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
No creature can survive in the forbidden zone. I know. I've been there. I've seen it.
"Then how do you account for me?"
I don't.
And I'm not going to try.
But what about your theory?
The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Do you want to get my head chopped off?
Don't be foolish.
If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
No, they won't.
Cornelius has developed the most brilliant hypothesis.
But I'm probably wrong.
That the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man.
In his trip to the forbidden zone, he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time.
- The evidence was very meager.
- You didn't think so then.
That was before Dr. Zaius and half of the Academy said my idea was heresy.
How can scientific truth be heresy?
What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed?
A mutation.
A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape.
Touchy, isn't he?
"I am not a missing link."
Well, if he were a missing link, the sacred scrolls wouldn't be worth their parchment.
Well, maybe they're not.
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm not going to get into that battle.
- Cornelius, show some strength!
- Zira, listen to me!
Now, we both have fine futures.
Marriage, stimulating careers.
I'm up for a raise.
Dr. Zaius.
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
No, sir. I was just collecting my notes.
You know Dr. Maximus, of course.
Our commissioner for animal affairs.
Yes, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
What is that?
A man, Dr. Maximus.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules.
No animals allowed outside the compound, and most especially not without a leash.
Yes, sir, but... but this creature is a special case.
Why special?
We're conducting a new experiment.
Wouldn't that more properly be done in your office?
Yes, sir.
Guards, return this beast to the compound.
What is this?
A toy.
It floats on the air.
Zira...
Try it.
Nonsense.
- What's up, lieutenant?
- We're taking number four to surgery.
- Have him ready.
- How come?
- The beast's throat's nearly healed.
- The vet's going to geld him.
Dr. Zira won't like it.
She wants that pair to mate.
These orders come from Dr. Zaius himself.
There's nothing she can do about it.
If only you knew what they're going to do.
Stay still now. Don't give me any trouble.
Weep if you must, but make an end of sorrow.
He lives again.
Yes, he has found peace in heaven.
He was a model for us all, a gorilla to remember...
Hunter, warrior, defender of the faith.
Cherished husband, beloved father, generous master, yes.
He was a font of simian kindness.
The dear departed once said to me
"I never met an ape I didn't like."
Look! It's a man!
In heaven's name! Get rid of that creature!
Catch him!
Catch him! Catch him!
Come on, Quintus.
- Go get him!
- Taylor!
- Why did you run away?
- Security police.
I'm in charge of this man.
He is in the custody of the ministry of science.
Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape!
No one'll listen to me.
Only you.
You.
Nova.
You... Nova.
No...
Yeah. Me Tarzan, you Jane.
What are you doing?
Leave her alone, damn you!
Where are you taking her?
Damn you! You hairy scum!
Shut up, you freak!
Julius, you...
I said shut up!
It's a madhouse!
A madhouse!
Now I don't even have you.
Imagine me needing someone.
Back on Earth I never did.
Oh, there were women. Lots of women.
Lots of... lovemaking, but no love.
That was the kind of world we'd made.
So I left because there was no one to hold me there.
Did I tell you about Stewart?
Now there was a lovely girl.
The most precious cargo we'd brought along.
She was... to be the new Eve.
With our hot and eager help, of course.
Probably just as well she didn't make it this far.
Do you love me, I wonder?
Can you love, I wonder?
Well...
You're not as smart as Stewart, but you're the only girl in town.
Look at that. I...
I taught you to smile.
It's been weeks.
What happened? Where have you been?
Why didn't you come to see me?
- What is this?
- A hearing.
- Be clever. Be quiet.
- All rise!
Be seated!
This ad hoc tribunal of the National Academy is now in session.
The president of the Academy presiding.
On my right, Dr. Maximus, commissioner for animal affairs. And on my left,
Dr. Zaius, minister of science and chief defender of the faith.
And appearing for the state,
Dr. Honorious, deputy minister ofjustice.
Bailiff! Your instructions:
To clean up the beast.
These rags he's wearing give off a stench that's offensive to the dignity of this tribunal.
You may proceed,
- Dr. Honorious.
- By your leave, Mr. President, this tribunal has not yet defined the purpose for this inquiry.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case.
Surely you must know why you're here.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Objection!
This exhibit is indeed a man.
Therefore he has no rights under ape law.
Dr. Zira, this is a man,
- is it not?
- He is unlike any man you have ever seen.
As we hope to prove.
Answer the question, Dr. Zira. Is it a man?
Sir, perhaps the... question is the point at issue.
Is he a man, is he a deviant, or... a freak of nature?
- Objection!
- Sustained.
Now, Dr. Zira, in all fairness, you must admit that the accused is a non-ape and therefore has no rights under ape law.
Then why is he called the accused?
Your Honors must think him guilty of something.
The creature's not being tried.
He's being disposed of.
It is scientific heresy that is being tried here.
Well put, Dr. Zaius.
Let us warn our friends that they endanger their own careers by defending this animal.
Then I'll... defend myself.
Dr. Zira, would you tell
Bright Eyes to be quiet?
- My name is Taylor!
- Bailiff! Silence the animal!
Wait! Let me...
You may proceed, Mr. Prosecutor.
Learned judges, my case is simple.
It is based on our first article of faith.
That the almighty created the ape in his own image.
That he gave him a soul and a mind.
That he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle and made him the lord of the planet.
These sacred truths are self-evident.
The proper study of apes is apes.
But certain young cynics have chosen to study man.
Yes! Perverted scientists who advance an insidious theory called evolution.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorious.
The state charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues, to produce a speaking monster.
That's a lie!
Mind your tongue, madam.
Did we create his mind as well?
Not only can this man speak, he can think! He can reason.
That can reason?
With the tribunal's permission, allow me to expose this hoax by direct examination.
Proceed, doctor. But do not turn this hearing into a farce.
Tell the court, Bright Eyes, what is the second article of faith?
I know nothing of your culture.
I admit that.
Of course he doesn't know our culture, because he cannot think!
Tell us... Why are all apes created equal?
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
Ridiculous!
Tell us, Bright Eyes.
Why do men have no souls?
What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
Read this for me.
Since the defendant has been forbidden to speak in his own defense, he requests that the following statement be read into the record.
You read it, Dr. Cornelius. Read it.
"I have, uh, come to you from a planet in a different solar system."
"I am an explorer in space..."
Stop right there. Let me see that paper.
It's a joke.
In very poor taste.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Dr. Zira, you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.
You state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions with him at the time of his capture.
That is his assertion.
Mr. President, in addition to Bright Eyes,
I believe the prosecutor has reassembled all the surviving humans that were captured in the hunt.
That's true, Dr. Zaius.
Very well.
Then I suggest that we... go take a look at 'em.
That's him! That's Landon!
- Which one?
- The tall one in the back.
Do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
- With one of them, yes.
- Identify him, then. Speak to him.
Landon?
Landon.
Oh! They cut him!
Did you know about this?
No. I... I swear.
I never saw this man before.
But they...
You did it.
You cut up his brain, you bloody baboon!
Stop him!
Take him inside!
Mr. President, a word of explanation.
The human specimen you saw outside suffered a skull fracture in the course of the hunt.
Two fine veterinary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life.
But the beast could not speak, of course.
Nor will he ever speak.
You did that to him, damn you!
Cut out his memory, took his identity, and that's what you wanna do to me!
Bailiff! Gag the animal!
Damn you!
May it please the tribunal,
I grant you that this creature cannot have come from another planet.
But this much is certain. He does come from somewhere in the forbidden zone.
He's described the region to us and described it accurately for...
I have been there.
You visited the forbidden zone?
Yes, sir.
A year ago.
With the permission of the Academy.
He exceeded his orders.
His travel permit was canceled immediately.
Yes, sir. That is true, thanks to you.
But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written.
Objection! These remarks are profane and irrelevant!
Sustained. Your archaeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.
Let them talk, Mr. President.
Let them talk.
Sirs, our theories have a bearing on his identity.
How so?
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false.
But if he did not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own.
Yes! Sprang! As an animal psychologist,
I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
- Objection!
- Sustained!
Their speech organs are adequate.
The flaw lies not in anatomy, but in the brain.
- Objection!
- Sustained!
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Yes! Behold this marvel!
This living paradox!
This missing link in an evolutionary chain!
Silence there!
You go too far.
I think an indictment is in order.
Yes, sir. The state charges Drs. Zira and
Cornelius with contempt of this tribunal, malicious mischief, and scientific heresy.
It is so ordered.
This tribunal will examine the evidence and in due course render its verdict.
As to the proposed indictment and as to the disposition of the deviate in question, this hearing is adjourned.
Wait outside.
Well, the verdict is in.
At the moment, your two simian friends and sponsors are free on bail.
But they'll soon be brought to trial for heresy.
What about me?
Your case was preordained.
In a way, you did the state a service because you made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.
Now the tribunal has placed you in my custody for final disposition.
Do you realize what that means?
No.
Emasculation to begin with.
Then experimental surgery on the speech centers - on the brain.
Eventually a kind of living death.
However,
I have it in my power to grant a reprieve.
That is why I summoned you here tonight.
Tell me who and what you really are and where you came from, and no veterinary shall touch you.
I told you that at that hearing of yours.
You lied!
Where is your tribe?
My tribe!
They live on another planet in another solar system.
Even in your lies, some truth slips through.
That mythical community you're supposed to come from -
Fort Wayne.
- What about it?
- A fort!
Unconsciously you chose a name that was belligerent.
Where were you nurtured?
Then... you don't believe that prosecutor's charge that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira?
Certainly not.
You're a mutant.
That's what Zira and Cornelius claim.
You're talking heresy, doctor.
Of course!
Suppose I am a mutant.
How can the appearance of one mutant
- send you into a panic?
- Because you're not unique.
- There's the one you call Landon.
- Oh. Then you admit that...
I admit that where there's one mutant, there's probably another and another.
A whole nest of them.
Where is your nest, Taylor?
Where are your women?
Thank you.
Thank you for calling me Taylor.
Dr. Zaius,
I know who I am.
But who are you?
How in hell did this upside-down civilization get started?
You may well call it upside down, since you occupy its lowest level.
And deservedly so.
Our eastern desert has never been explored because we've always assumed that life cannot exist there.
Taylor, save yourself!
Tell me, is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone?
I don't know.
If you're trying to protect others of your kind, it'll cost you your identity.
I'm not protecting anyone.
This whole thing is insane!
What have I done?
You are a menace.
A walking pestilence!
I do know who you are, Taylor.
I'll give you just six hours to make a full confession.
After that
I shall use surgery to obtain one.
Guards!
All right. You can cut pieces out of me.
You've got the power.
Return this creature to his cage.
But you do it out of fear!
Remember that!
Because you're afraid of me!
What are you afraid of, doctor?
Are you Julius?
- Who are you?
- I'm from the office of animal affairs.
That male is to be transferred to the zoo.
At this hour?
Who says so?
Don't they tell you anything?
The antivivisectionist society is up in arms.
They're gonna save this beast from those butchers in the lab.
If he can speak, he belongs in a public zoo, but what'll probably happen is some money-mad grown-up'll put him in a circus, and we'll have to pay...
Stop making speeches and show me the order!
This order's no good.
It must be countersigned by Dr. Zaius.
Grab him!
Who are you?
So you can talk!
I'm Dr. Zira's nephew.
This abduction was her idea.
You're not really going to the zoo.
That's our story if somebody stops us.
Get me out of this.
We've gotta move fast!
She comes along too.
- Zira doesn't want your female.
- I want her.
If you insist, but I'm not taking any orders.
All right. Come on! Let's go!
- I told you not to bring the other one!
- He wouldn't leave her.
Oh, all right. Come on!
- Here. Put this on.
- Don't you have any clothes for me?
What do you expect? An ape's new suit?
- This stuff stinks!
- Well, so do you. Like all men.
Taylor, remember, all men look alike to most apes.
So put it on and keep quiet, and we may just get away with this. Hurry!
Cornelius!
How'd it go?
Come on!
Let me out of this!
Well, Taylor, we're all fugitives now.
Do you have any weapons? Any guns?
The best. But we won't need them.
I'm glad to hear it. I want one anyway.
Taylor, I'm in charge of this expedition!
Good for you.
But you're not in charge of me.
Not any more.
I don't plan to be caught again.
- As you wish.
- Dr. Zaius seemed to think there was another jungle beyond the forbidden zone.
I'll try for that. What about you?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy.
Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
You're going back to the forbidden zone?
We're going back to the diggings
I worked at over a year ago.
It's a three-day ride across the desert.
Near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
- You still don't believe me, do you?
- It's a long detour to Dead Lake.
- What would we find?
- Nothing much.
An empty rubber life raft. Maybe a... little flag, the emblem of my countrymen.
The terrain around that lake is poisonous.
There's no fresh water, no vegetation - nothing.
Anyway, I... ought to thank you for saving me. You'll be in trouble for that.
We've been in trouble since the moment we met you.
What's she pointing at?
This must be close to home for her.
She knows it.
Nova, no. Nova!
Nova, you can't go there!
It's not safe! Nova!
We'd better get started.
If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far.
Right. Let's get the water and provisions into the wagon.
Cornelius!
Where does this river lead to?
It flows into a sea some miles from here.
That's where we'll find the diggings.
And beyond that?
I don't know. You can't ride along the shore at high tide and we had no boats on our last expedition.
You never told me - why do you call this the forbidden zone?
No one knows. It's an ancient taboo, set forth in the sacred scrolls.
The lawgiver pronounced this whole area deadly.
Shouldn't we be moving on?
I'm for that.
Well? Do you like it?
Why did you do that? Scrape off your hair?
In my world, when I left it, only kids your age wore beards.
Beards?
I don't go in for fads.
Somehow it makes you look less intelligent.
When will you show me what's in that cave?
Right now, if you like.
Cornelius!
- Lucius, don't fire at them!
- You're all under arrest!
If there's any more shooting,
Dr. Zaius, you'll be the first to go.
You can count on it.
You are not in command.
Put down that gun.
Shut up!
Very well.
Lower your weapons.
Tell them to pull back around the rocks, out of range.
Withdraw!
How did you know we'd come here?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate would flee to the forbidden zone.
And only a fool would give a gun to an animal.
I see you've brought the female of your species.
I didn't realize that man could be monogamous.
On this planet it's easy.
I'll ask you to reconsider the rash course you've undertaken.
If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years, but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
We never meant to be treasonous, sir.
But up there, in the face of that cliff, there is a vast cave, and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
There's your minister of science.
Honor-bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
- Taylor, please!
- Except he's also chief defender of the faith.
There is no contradiction between faith and science - true science.
- Are you willing to put it to the test?
- Taylor, I would rather...
Take it easy. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can return the favor.
What is your proposal?
When were those sacred scrolls of yours written?
1,200 years ago.
All right. If they can prove those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history, if they can find some real evidence of another culture from some remote past, will you let them off?
- Of course.
- Let's go up to the cave.
Sorry, Lucius. You've got to stay here and guard the camp.
Always giving orders.
Just like every other adult.
Relax. You'll get to see it all later on.
Present your evidence, Cornelius.
It was at this level that I discovered traces of an early ape creature.
A stage of primitive barbarism really, dating back some 1,300 years roughly.
It was at this level... I discovered cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas.
But the artifacts lying here were found at this level, and date back... 700 years earlier.
That's the paradox.
For the more ancient culture is the more advanced.
Now, admittedly, many of these objects are unidentified.
But clearly they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge of metallurgy.
Indeed, the fact that many of these tools are unknown to us suggests a culture which in certain ways equals our own.
Some of the evidence is uncontestable.
Don't speak to me in absolutes.
The evidence is contestable!
I apologize, sir.
To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude to say the least.
There are geologists on my staff who'd laugh at your speculations.
But there's the doll, sir.
What?
Oh, lying right there. The human doll.
What does this prove?
My granddaughter plays with human dolls.
The doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossil has been found in this deposit.
Your conclusion is premature.
Have you forgotten your scripture?
The 13th scroll?
"And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden and chained him to a tree,
- and the children did make sport of him."
- No, sir, I have not forgotten.
Well, for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets until our lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed.
Keep digging, Cornelius.
You'll find evidence of the master of this house...
An ape.
What are you doing?
Reconstructing a past life.
You say these things were found at the same level as that doll?
Whoever owned them must have been in pretty bad shape.
He wore false teeth.
And eyeglasses.
He had a failing heart.
Towards the end, he... had this prefabricated valve put in it.
I don't say he was a man like I knew at home, but he must have been a close relative.
He had all the same weaknesses.
He was a weak, fragile animal.
But he was here before you and he was better than you are.
That's lunacy! I can offer alternate descriptions of every one of those articles which is just as ingenious as yours.
But it'd be conjecture, not proof.
Mamma!
Dr. Zaius, would an ape make a human doll that talks?
Lucius!
You dirty...
Nova!
Cornelius!
Zira!
Help me!
Mamma!
I oughta kill you right now.
Come on!
Tell 'em to pull back. Now!
Cease fire! Withdraw!
Up there!
Withdraw!
Get down!
Lucius, are you all right?
They took me by surprise.
Sneaked up on me while I was feeding the horses.
What's happened to honor?
I got off two rounds to warn you.
- They've taken everything.
- Not quite everything!
They left a hostage behind.
- How are you feeling?
- Disillusioned.
You can't trust the older generation.
I know what you mean.
I want you to go round the rocks and tell those gorillas I've got Dr. Zaius prisoner.
Yes, I can do that.
I want a horse, food, and water.
Enough for a week for me and this female.
- And 50 rounds of ammunition.
- What if they won't agree to your terms?
Tell them I'll shoot him.
Taylor, you can't!
Oh, yes, he can.
He's a born killer.
Deliver the message.
Over here.
Sit down.
Taylor, please! Don't treat him like that!
- Why not?
- It's humiliating.
The way I was humiliated... by all of you?
You led me around on a leash!
That was different.
We thought you were inferior.
Now you know better.
Cornelius was right, doctor. He proved it.
Man was here first. You owe him your science, your culture,
- whatever civilization you've got.
- Then answer me this.
If man was superior, why didn't he survive?
Wiped out by a plague, some natural catastrophe, a storm of meteors.
From the looks of some parts of this planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
But we can't be sure.
He is.
He knew all the time.
Long before you found your cave, he knew.
Defender of the faith?
Guardian of the terrible secret.
- That's it, isn't it, doctor?
- What I know of man was written long ago.
Set down by the greatest ape of all, our lawgiver.
Cornelius, come here.
Reach into my pocket. Read to him the 29th scroll.
6th verse.
"Beware the beast man, for he is the devil's pawn."
"Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed."
"Yea, he will murder his brother to possess his brother's land."
"Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours."
"Shun him."
"Drive him back into his jungle lair."
"For he is the harbinger of death."
I found nothing in the cave to alter that conception of man and I still live by its injunction.
That's far enough!
They think you're behaving foolishly.
I must say, I agree!
Where will you go?
To start with, I'll follow the shoreline and my nose.
But suppose you find nothing but... but wasteland?
How will you survive?
He won't survive.
Nova.
How about coming along?
- We can't.
- It's better than going to jail for heresy.
Oh, they can't convict us of heresy.
You've helped prove our innocence.
Besides... his culture is our culture.
Well, good luck, then.
Lucius.
I still say you're making a mistake.
That's the spirit. Keep 'em flying.
- What?
- The flags of discontent.
Remember, never trust anybody over 30.
Doctor, I'd like to kiss you goodbye.
All right, but you're so damned ugly.
Don't try to follow us.
I'm pretty handy with this.
Of that I'm sure.
All my life I've awaited your coming and dreaded it, like death itself.
Why?
I've terrified you from the first, doctor.
I still do.
You're afraid of me and you hate me. Why?
Because you're a man.
And you're right.
I have always known about man.
From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy.
His emotions must rule his brain.
He must be a warlike creature who gives battle to everything around him, even himself.
What evidence?
There were no weapons in that cave.
The forbidden zone was once a paradise.
Your breed made a desert of it... ages ago.
It still doesn't give me the why.
A planet where apes evolved from men.
There's gotta be an answer.
Don't look for it, Taylor.
You may not like what you find.
Untie me!
No, no, no! Wait!
Wait!
Let him go!
Lieutenant, fetch your explosives.
We're going to seal up the cave.
Yes, sir!
- Seal the cave?
- That is correct.
And you will both stand trial for heresy.
- But the proof! The doll!
- In a few minutes there will be no doll.
There can't be. I'm sorry.
Dr. Zaius!
Dr. Zaius, you mustn't! You promised!
What I do, I do with no pleasure.
- Silence him!
- Doctor.
Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable!
Why must knowledge stand still?
What about the future?
I may just have saved it for you.
What will he find out there, doctor?
His destiny.
Oh, my God!
I'm back!
I'm home.
All the time, it was...
We finally really did it.
You maniacs!
You blew it up!
God damn you!
God damn you all to hell!
Prodis Presents
No!
I won!
And I want my prize!
So what do you want?
That lily.
Good, I just wanted to refresh myself.
There’s shooting.
That’s probably hunters.
- Take it.
- I don’t need it.
Angelique, who plays like that?
You asked for prize and I brought you a flower 
Very well, I will return it to it’s place .
No!
What’s with you?
No, Nothing.
This is not a hunt.
Lets go.
- Let me go! I must avenge them!
- No! You’re alone!
- Doesn’t matter, let me!
- No! You run to Sanc?, and I will run to Monteloup.
We must alert all villages and tell them all to run to the castle.
- I’ll kill these dogs!
- Do what I told you! Run!
- Where is Angelique?
- I don’t know, Baron.
Where is Angelique?
Don’t worry, nobody will dare to offend our little  Angelique.
Place that cart by the main gate.
Prepare a bonfire nearby 
Monsieur Baron! Monsieur Baron!
Angelique, She’s here!
Let Mademoiselle Angelique inside.
Finally!
In times like this you should go far away from home. I couldn’t find a place for myself.
Help us, Saint Ignatius. Help us.
Help us, Saint Damian.
Help Us.
Here you are!
Where were you?
I must introduce to you:
My sister, Angelique.
Instead of running around God knows where,
You should have met  Monsieur Fallot 
Counselor of Parliament in Paris and my fianc?e.
If I had sat at home, I couldn’t have raised the alarm
How could our father pander to her pranks?
Immediately go change your clothes!
I’m shocking you, mother? And you, brother?
And you, Monsieur Counselor?
- Can’t you do without stupid jokes?.
- It’s better to joke stupidly, than not at all.
- You think that everything is allowed for beautiful?
- Yes, so what?
This is not the time for quarrels.
- She must respect me!
- I saved your life.
- Pray to God that this would help us.
- Let’s pray.
Don’t shoot, let them come closer.
Nicolas!
Charge! Charge!
This Plessis-Belli?res is a fine fellow
He fights like he dances
Road is open!
Bravo!
Congratulations, cousin. Your son is a hero.
We all owe our lives to him.
This is nothing for Philippe.
Sometimes it is nice to have a son colonel.
Any fight he turns into a miracle
He hides us all in the forests and waits until the bandits would run out of ammo then fire a musket volley and we tear them apart
This was wonderful interlude!
There was one man , all black, then suddenly his head burst and he became all red !
Time will come when you will be locked in a cage with someone handsome like that one
And he will take you away from here.
How wonderful!
And after that one man who was black became so red , so red
- Angelique!
- Yes, father. You need me?
- Come, say hello to our guests.
- I won’t go.
Come with me, I said!
- Very glad to see you.
- This is your brave cousin.
- Can I kiss her?
- I thought you were more gallant.
- So, I’ll make the first step.
- No, not me!.
This a real little devil! Let me hug you. She’s charming!
Cousin, this pearl needs a fitting frame.
You must take her to us in Plessis 
She will be wonderful friend to my wife
Let’s go with us.
I won’t.
She is so cute and modest.
Isn’t she, Adelaide? 
Philippe has arrived!
Take the horse.
Philippe, dear !
Allow me to introduce: Angelique my cousin, marquise of the gloomy dress
Recently she didn’t even let me kiss herself, and I don’t even understand why
She probably prefers shepherds
Quiet!
Bertram, Robert… 
Taste of countryside, this is wonderful like a fresh fruit from a tree
Try it, Louis!
Your turn, Bernard
- There’s plenty for everyone! Go ahead, Maxim!
- What about me?
Absolutely! You all can in turn.
- She smells like berries.
- And you smell like stables!
Hey ! Hey!
Hold her !
My dear young friends, run around, play, but away from here!
Go, go.
I should have cut my fingernails
No ? You like it like that?
You have as many clothes as onion has layers
How can you wear so many clothes ?
I remember my horse was painted like this all covered in laces.
Oh well, too bad. Go away
Come in.
- Monsieur, he is here already.
- Let him in.
Well, monsieur Cl?ment Tonnel 
Here is what you have asked for
Beautiful color , isn’t it?
Green – color of hope.
Such a little bottle and there will not be a king, or his brother , or Mazarini
- Is it reliable?
- Yes, of course .
Person is taken over by the weakness and then death.
- Monsieur Fouke gave you a letter?
- Yes, monsieur.
Here it is.
Great.
He sealed the agreement with his signature we will finally refresh the royal blood
Thank monsieur Fouke and tell him to wait
I will act when there will be favorable moment. Let’s go monsieur.
What a smell!
Did someone insult you ?
Cousin can’t give me money, he needs them to help Fronde
- What will happen to us?
- I don’t know.
Poor Sanse loves his sheep so much that their smell follows him everywhere
Do you think that smell of poison is better?
At least we are not plotting to kill the King!
His highness, Prince de Cond?.
Monsieur, this is my daughter.
What did I say?
Any conspiracy is always against the King starting from Julius Caesar
Cutie…
She is charming
Are you in love with Julius Caesar ?
I understand passion for history of
Gallic War , I was passionate myself
Victories of Julius Caesar do you know about them ?
No, monsieur.
You will have to catch up on your history in one of the monasteries in Poitiers
Fronde will give your daughter opportunity of education, baron.
I am thankful to you beyond all limits
I don’t want to go to monastery!
Wishes of the Prince are not discussed they are carried out, my child
Let’s go Angelique, that’s enough.
Shameless!
- Oh, Guillaume!
- Mademoiselle Angelique!
I haven’t seen you for so long.
- Is this beautiful carriage ours?
- Yes.
- Why my father didn’t come.
- He couldn’t, he is very busy right now.
Why am I taken in the middle of the year? mademoiselle, you will receive all explanations at home, in Monteloup 
- Girls are in the monastery in La Rochelle 
- Your brother are in Nior College.
- Where’s father?
- He is in the mines.
What mines?
I abandoned these mines long ago now turned out it was wrong
Peyrac  suggested me to open it again.
This man has a flair
You know, Peyracs – the most noble and the richest family in Languedoc 
And Jeoffrey is a great swordsman, brilliant and mysterious
He is insanely rich and also  a poet and a scientist
His castle in Toulouse doesn’t have equals
In a word this is a great match.
- Is he very old?
- No, but, of course older than you,
Must I marry him?
Your wallet or your life?
Nicolas!
Yes, this is me.
And you. I can’t believe it.
I thought I will never see you again.
How beautiful you became more beautiful than before.
Don’t look at me like that.
Ang?lique Sanc? de Monteloup do not talk with poor anymore
This is ridiculous!
No, you are grown up now
You are daughter of Baron, and I’m just a servant.
I thought about you every day, every night, Angelique.
Leave me.
Then it is not a lie, you allowed sell yourself.
You’re out of your mind!
And how is this called? You met him in the monastery? 
I never seen him!
This is the exact point,
Madam Countess de Peyrac
Count de Peyrac the most distinguished noblemen in Languedoc
- And the richest.
- What’s wrong with that?
Of course, rich husband it is always good.
But wait, you didn’t see him yet.
This Peyrac is a real monster.
- This is not true!
- No, this is really true.
He is not only ugly, he is also old, scarred, and limping
- You’re lying!
- A real monster!
However, in bed this might be interesting, no ?
Soon you will see for yourself that I’m right!
Make way for the carriage of Count de Peyrac!
Make way for the carriage of Count de Peyrac!
Malivin, I’m asking you, don’t forget that you are notary
Madam, Even sun grows dark next to you.
I’m the happiest of mortals because I’m marrying you.
But at the same time I’m the most unfortunate because my name is Bernard D'Andijos because I’m marrying you as a proxy
According to special verdict enacted in our province,
Persons from different cities who are getting married, do it by the proxy.
Count de Peyrac will meet his  spouse only during religious ceremony in his city of Toulouse, where…
- What did you wish for?
- I wished for you to fall in love with me!
- For the bride!
- For the bride!
Angelique, you could at least smile
Peyrac doesn’t like sad girls.
D'Andijos,  is it true that he’s ugly?
Ugly?
Ugly!
No, he’s not ugly.
He’s monster!
Come, Nicolas.
Love me, Nicolas...
Love me.
Come here.
I want you to be my first.
You are kind, handsome, sweet and very gentle
- Will you be gentle, Nicolas?
- Yes.
No, No!
No, Nicolas!
How dared you, traitor!
- Stop, Guillaume , I order you!
- Let me go, I will teach him a lesson!
Dog, You will pay for this!
- Run, Run!
- No!
- They will catch you!
- Let’s run away together!
You know it is impossible!
But I won’t leave you alone!
They will come here soon.
Run quickly, I will catch up with you later.
I will be waiting for you in the forest, by the big tree near the pond.
Will you really come ?
Yes, yes.
Take this horse and run.
Long live the bride!
Welcome, these fireworks are in your honor.
We’ve stepped on to your land, Madame, into possessions of that wizard de Peyrac. 
Please over here, Madame .
Ang?lique Sanc? de Monteloup, do you agree, to be always and in every way obedient to 
Jeoffrey de Peyrac,
Arvalle, Cavarex,
Moraines and Eristrue
Yes.
Your cause is lost, Carmencita.
I don’t think so, dear.
To earn love of Peyrac is not enough to just a village girl.
I know tastes for Jeoffrey
He loves what burns and can scorch.
What will happen if he falls in love ?
She is quite cute.
He will play with her, until he is tired. and he will return to me, on his knees.
- Germontaz, please let me have this gavotte.
- I wanted to ask you the same exact thing.
Fine, Fine, Gentlemen.
So are we going to dance?
Yes, monsieur Peyrac, your wife will turn anybody’s head.
- We aren’t at risk, Monsignor.
- Why is that?.
Your cloth and my leg doesn’t allow us to dance.
- Isn’t it pity?
- What did you say?
I said , pity, but God created beauty, so that everyone could admire her.
- Well, admire her Monsignor,
- She has wonderful figure.
Will you be distracted by smoke?
- What is it?
- This is a cigar, Monsignor.
Oh, what abomination,
It’s even scary to look at.
I brought them from America.
This is an excellent tobacco.
- Sniff it or smoke a pipe.
- Cigars are much more pleasing.
Always your striving to be original.
This disturbs me, my son.
Do you hear me ?
Excuse me, Monsignor.
Excuse me, I can’t dance anymore
I must rest a little bit.
What luxury, what riches.
I hope, my child,  you won’t forget my poor ?
Of course I won’t, Monsignor your parish is my parish
Such humility is very commendable.
But... you chose yourself a strange husband.
Your hand, Madame.
I will help you, Madame.
Please , Madame.
Good night, Madame.
Take me quickly... and leave
You have no reason to insult me.
Good night, Madame.
I heard a lot about your beauty.
It is above any superlatives.
Good morning, Madame. Count ordered to prepare a horse riding dress for you.
My alchemy.
I will allow myself, to introduce myself to you.
You are my wife and don’t know anything about me.
They say, that Jeoffrey de Peyrac is a sorcerer and friend of the devil
I want to explain to you what is my wizardry.
These are my masters.
He is from China, there I’ve been learning chemistry and astronomy.
In India I’ve been learning all kinds of poisons and antidotes.
I learned algebra from Arabs.
I’ve been their prisoner.
They sunk my ship, and made up my face.
Kouassi-B?  saved me.
This is my accountant, he is son of my wet-nurse.
He is a brave warrior.
When me and him were in mortal danger, we jumped from the roof of a high building.
He broke both of his legs, and I only one.
This is Fritz Hauer, I met him in Saxony 10 years ago.
This is him who taught me how to mine gold.
My gold... it is also yours.
Well, now you have acquainted yourself with wizard.
Everything is ready.
A bar of pure gold.
If Archbishop saw it, he would’ve thrown me into the bonfire.
- Then you are really a sorcerer?
- You think so as well?
- What all this show is for?
- For my wife to know me.
Thank you, for today’s night.
- Thank me for you leaving you alone?.
- Yes.
I couldn’t do it any differently .
How could I instill disgust for love in such a woman.
- Thank You.
- Don’t Thank me.
I know I will be rewarded for this sacrifice. and I’m sure that you won’t be just a wife to me... but a lover as well.
You are surely wrong, this will never happen.
- You’re gorgeous , even when you’re angry.
- Why did you marry me?
Until I met you, because of the mines.
- Business before everything?
- After I saw you, because of your beauty.
And now?
Because of courage. And when you will be mine
I will become the happiest man on Earth.
- This will never happen.
- Time changes a lot of things.
But please stay the way you are.
Allow me... to give you this bar of gold ?
Give it to these people.
Fritz, carry out the order of the Countess.
Hey, over here!
For Countess de Peyrac!
Why, dear Count, you are not following the tradition?
There is no test stone in the glass of  Countess
- There is no in mine too.
- Is this the reason?
And who here wants to poison my wife ? You ?
I didn’t mean any of your guests.
However all the security measures must be followed.
And the main measure, of course is the stone, which loses it’s colors, when surrounded in poison. traditions must be respected.
But Monsignor, sometimes they bring only harm.
All nobility follows this tradition.
Some even swallowed the stone... and died from that.
Madame, allow me to leave.
I must prepare a sermon about humility
I hope you will come to listen to it.
And now, since he’s left, tell us some story.
Please, Jeoffrey!
A love story !
Are they all in love with him ?
Possibly.
- And he is always so obliging with them?
- But they are his guests.
Oh what can I do with you, let’s go.
- What do they want?
- To listen to their idol.
So, a tale about love.
Once upon a time on a river bank a pretty girl was sitting... still very young and when...
I’m sorry, you shouldn’t listen to this.
Countess is tired and asking to excuse her.
Are you thinking that I’m so stupid ?
I’m afraid that 
I’m much more stupid myself
Young man was very persistent, but girl was a better swimmer.
- I will finish it next time.
- This can’t be! Is this all?
The Archbishop’s guards are after me.
I’ve ran away from Switzerland.
- Physicist Bernoui...
- Are you from Geneva?
Yes, but in Toulouse inquisition got on my trail. I almost got caught.
Come, in my house you will be in complete safety.
My such early visit is explained by my care about you.
Hiding a man wanted by inquisition is punishable by death.
What are you talking about?
An Officer of the Guards  insists that he saw him. He saw how he can in here
Would be nice to ask about this the beautiful Countess de Peyrac.
Kouassi-B? , ask Countess to come here , please.
You’re overstepping your boundaries Peyrac.
You can reach boundaries of my kingdom only by riding the horse.
- You will ride too far this way!.
- Not farther than the skies!
Will you allow me to ask Countess a few questions ?
Yes, if this will not tire her?
This night one man sneaked in here
Have you seen him ?
Tell the truth, Angelique. 
I didn’t see anyone.
Good catholic , of course couldn’t lie to her shepherd.
- What do you mean?.
- So you didn’t see anyone?
No.
Then my guards were just dreaming, and there is no runaway. and there is no mines in Salcini and there no any suspicious deeds at all suspicious?
Will you dare to show me , how you produce the gold?
Is this a challenge?
Yes it is a challenge.
I will wait for you tomorrow in Salcini without fail.
Everyone says that you are a bit of a  sorcerer
I want to know if this is true
- I’m thankful to you for this lie.
- I wanted to save this unfortunate.
When D'Andijos  came to take him from here  you have seen it.
I didn’t think that you can lie.
He shouldn’t speak in German,
I must understand everything.
Why did you let in this barbarian ?
He won’t understand anything.
So be it.
I want that someone else believed it.
- Those who play with fire are serving devil!
- This is not a game, my dear Bechene
This is a chemical process called purification.
- And what will be produced?
- Right it is lead.
While heating lead absorbs gold
Gold! I thought so.
And now watch, if you’re really want to understand.
We fill forms with ashes of bones
Ashes, bones, everything is clear Peyrac this is  the real sorcery.
Look Angelique, lead passes through ashes and the gold is left in the form.
You transform lead into gold ?
Fan the fire, fan it
Peyrac you are cheating people, but you will never be able to cheat God.
Don’t listen to his silliness
You are wizard. Everyone could’ve make gold if this was so easy.
He is so annoying.
Everyone knows 7 notes of octave, but only monsieur Louli can write opera.
Go give him one bar.
- What, he gotten so poor?
- Do what I said.
Allow me to accompany you.
But I’m not in a hurry.
And I don’t want you to leave.
You ride with the speed of a devil!
But I am a devil!
- What is it, another mine?.
- Yes and the most valuable one. You’ll see now.
- Where is she?
- Here, please.
She is 2000 years old, but she is still young.
Forever young, like a true love.
Just don’t tell me, that it is too beautiful
It is breathtaking.
I brought it from India.
It sank twice with me.
It’s like it was made for you.
Look at yourself.
I’m sorry!
You are repulsed by me.
I can see it.
I’ve lost.
You are not my wife and not my lover.
I didn’t love anyone like that in my life
- I can’t be without you!
- I’m very sorry.
It is unbearable, return to me!
Jeofrrey , I’m begging you!
Find somebody else, you can console you.
Very well, Jeoffrey! If I’ll be asked about you, I will find what to say !
Excuse me.
I will have my revenge!
Jeoffrey, I was looking for you to tell you...
Le chevalier de Germontaz.
I didn’t invite him.
What a surprise?
What brings you here?
His Holiness doesn’t wish to accept gifts from the devil.
Devil can’t answer to this insult, but I can!
I’m waiting for you tomorrow morning at 6 in Bressenclode !
Magnificent D'Andijos!
- You’re ready for anything for this vixen!
- Tomorrow in Bressenclode !
No, not with you and not tomorrow, but with me and right now!
Your choice of weapons.
A sword.
Germontaz is the best swordsman in Languedoc!
He already killed 20 men!
- Jeoffrey you’re crazy!
- Yes, but this is how is.
But this is won’t be a duel but murder!
Stop him!
This is not in my powers anymore.
Begin.
You’re crying ?
You’re gorgeous.
This is unjust...
You are the beauty itself, and my face is all covered in ugly scars, and such leg.
You don’t notice any of this, when you’re in love.
- You are not afraid of me anymore?
- No.
But I haven’t changed.
I love you!
No, love is definitely blind.
Are you falling asleep?
Jeoffrey, I just understood ,how foolish
I was. But I didn’t know you then.
This was before...
Before what?
Before us.
Are you sleeping?
I was a fool too.
You?
I waited for so long.
Waited for what?
To tell you...
About what?
That I love you, love.
Jeoffrey!
Yes, dear?
Madame, Countess!
Madame, Countess!
Madam Countess, look he walks!
Florimount is walking already!
Urgent letter, monsieur Count.
Report to His Majesty that he will honor me greatly.
Can you guess who is going to visit us?
I didn’t invite anyone, and I don’t want to see anyone but you.
But to accept this visitor is a great honor.
The King will stop here on his road from Saint Jean de Liu with his  young wife.
Dish “The Ship of Love”
This is a turkey, inside it a duck, inside which is a quail with Parma ham.
Recipe is mine.
Accompanied with truffles.
Skylark with p?t?... 
His Majesty my brother won’t get up, until he eats everything. This will take couple hours
This can’t be helped.
“Pomerole”,from the year 1692.
Very light, Sir.
What is the wine over there ?
I think, something Roman ?
Absolutely right, Sir,
Julius Caesar loved this wine.
I don’t have such good wine cellar as you do.
- You’re probably a great connoisseur of wines?
- No, I more prefer music.
Yes, I saw your collection of instruments, it’s admirable.
Besides this, you are collector of medals and antique sculpture.
Wonderful.
- I love it, Sir.
- And this is enough?
To love – means to wish passionately, and then you can achieve anything.
You wished a whole lot!
I’d like to wish like you as well.
By the way, tell me about the gold, rumors about which reaching me.
Imagine Sir, that you have a rock.
And you explode it, by using gunpowder.
So am I, blowing up my hills, crush them, heat them, separate minerals and receive gold.
Your friend Peyrac is out of his mind..
Teasing my cousin ?
You amaze me, Peyrac.
But your biggest jewel is something else entirely.
- And you are hiding her from me.
- Sir?
Madame de Peyrac.
They say, she is unbelievably beautiful?
She is waiting when you allow her to appear.
- She’s astonishing!.
- Quiet!
You are delightful, Madame.
Thank You.
- You should be more careful!
- Me?
But yes. These shoulders, these breasts, this is a challenge, my dear!
Court is strict, ladies are clothed up to their ears. Very unpleasant fashion, but can’t be helped.
Anna Maria Louise, please introduce me.
De Vardes, the most dangerous seducer in Paris.
- What is the danger?
- I will show it to you.
And the biggest jackass.
And he looks similar!
I like you very much,
Peyrac and you. You are so funny.
If you’ll visit  Paris, drop me a visit.
Looking at all this,
I’m dying from hunger!
Frankness for frankness, wait, I’ll be right back.
Would you order to start a ball,
Your Majesty?
Her Majesty the Queen is a little bit tired.
Why are you laughing?
You were so beautiful last night, surrounded by all these court ladies.
A pearl among the pees.
- Will you never cheat me?
- Never.
- If you ever do this...
- You will kill me.
Quick, Quick, hurry up!
King doesn’t like to wait...
King couldn’t do that...
Common, hurry up, faster!
The King left and didn’t tell me anything ?
You know well that The King is everywhere at home and everywhere master.
He already gave you an honor, by stopping here.
- Where to?
Carry it outside!
Everything take outside!
Hurry up!
And he left just like that, didn’t say a word?
But I have saved his life.
6 years ago Cond? was in
Plessis-Belli?res and was preparing a plot.
He received a bottle of poison, and I happened to be nearby and saw everything.
I’ve noticed where prince de Cond? hid the chest with poison, and stole it.
Don’t laugh!
Now prince de Cond?  has excellent relationship with the King’s brother.
If he finds out everything, he will want to get rid of you.
Where are you going?
I must see the King.
- And you will tell him everything?
No, what for?
But no one leaves my house like that.
Leave him – he did it from sadness, you have seen his wife.
Don’t risk our happiness, Jeoffrey.
This is what I want to protect.
I saw how he was looking at you last night.
I’m afraid for you.
If the King is our enemy,
I must know about it.
Jeoffrey!
- I came to say good by.
- Who let you in?
Your husband rode away, your servants ran away, I couldn’t leave you alone.
- Go away!
- How many times I’ve been told that!
But all ladies later thanked me for don’t listening to them
The weren’t scrupulous!
Let go of me!
Help someone!
Don’t touch me!
Help ! Help!
Don’t raise your sword, I don’t fight with scoundrels , I just slap them!
Nothing, I will still get to her.
She won’t get away from me.
You can be assured, she will be mine!
Where is Peyrac?.
He decided to talk with the King.
He mustn’t do that!
He’s out of his mind!
I must return him immediately, even if by force.
Say good night.
Good night, my baby.
Good night.
What happened?
- What happened?
- Master was attacked.
He killed one of them, but they were too many.
They took Master away in a carriage.
- Where these Archbishop’s men?
- No, soldiers of the King.
- And King saw all of this?
- No, ambush was earlier.
This is impossible.
What did he do to them?
- D'Andijos, where is he ?
- He went to Paris to talk to the King.
Order to prepare a carriage.
I will go as well.
I must see the King.
- Look, what do you say, I learned it?
- What?
How to get to Rue de Pale ?
Drive along Seine until the last island, and there take first street to the right. 
- Did you stole anything from them?
- No.
I had a good harvest today.
You know what, let’s go to my place?
Leave me alone, do your business.
I have to think.
Do you want to compromise me?
Your husband is under arrest, and you come into a house of prosecutor’s wife!
- Into a house of my sister.
- Ah, a sister?
- And did you think about her in Toulouse?
- You are hating Jeoffrey?
- If you married a freak...
- Jeoffrey  a freak?
You don’t know anything. Jeoffrey is the best of husbands and excellent lover!
- Are you not ashamed to say such thing?
- Do you know  such thing?
- I’m disgusted to listen to you!
- And I pity your husband.
Why, Madame?
- This is you who should be pitied.
- Have you found out anything?
But remember, this is a secret.
- In the morning your husband was transferred to Bastille.
- So he’s in Bastille...
This is serious.
Very serious.
But no one comes out of there!
I can admire your self-control, but order for arrest is signed by the King.
But into prison registry are not entered neither the name of Peyrac no the offence.
- King wants to avoid the scandal.
- Exactly.
- And that means , he will free Jeoffrey.
- I’m not sure about that.
Then what will happen to him?
Sometimes  a prison, becomes a tomb.
Sorbonne, to me!
I must talk with Countess de Peyrac,
I’m from a Maitre Fallot.
Quiet Sorbonne, we are in high society.
Who is this?
Madam de Peyrac,
I’m Fran?ois Desgrez , an attorney.
Maitre Fallot told me that you need a cunning man.
But need an attorney at law, not a cunning person.
I understand, how no one else will take up the defense of your husband.
And now to business, I only need some information from you and a payment.
You won’t get anything. And I will do perfectly fine without your services.
I have connections in the court.
Well if it is true...
Sorbonne!
Jack loses,
Queen wins.
But why was he arrested,
I still can’t find this out.
Jack and 10.
I win again. I’m lucky today.
He was placed in a special cell.
What will happen to him now?
Jack and 10,
I win again.
He will be tried, well see what happens then.
Is it impossible to save him?
End of deck!
New game!
I will do everything that’s in my power.
But too little time has passed.
King still haven’t forgotten my participation in The Fronde.
- 10,000 louir.
- Bank.
I ran all over Paris.
Finally I have found you!
Oh, my friend!
Angelique... bad news from Toulouse.
Your estate was arrested, everything at all is sealed.
But Why? Did we hosted the King badly ?
- On the contrary, too well.
- Did it make him jealous?
I don’t know, but it’s possible.
However I think there’s different reason.
- Countess de Peyrac?.
- Yes.
Madame, I must give you this invitation.
His Highness, King’s Brother awaits you tomorrow at 4pm
- Me?
- You.
The talk will be about your husband.
But this is a secret for now.
So, at 4pm in Louver.
- What is it?
- Everything will be ok.
God, You are almighty, protect Jeoffrey, tell me what to do.
I will bear anything for Jeoffrey, for Phlorimone and for the child, which I carry.
It’s too late, let’s go Madame.
It’s dark in the streets, we can be attacked.
- Who should be I afraid of?
- You’re brave, but I’m scared. 
Paris is a terribly city, and I don’t even have a light.
His Highness is asking to excuse him.
He is not feeling good, sudden bout of fever.
- When should I come then?
- Tomorrow, here, at the same time.
- Thank you.
- Tuilri Gates are closed already.
Pass through the garden of Infantes.
Please over here.
This path is much shorter,
In 20 steps you will be on the New Bridge.
For God’s sake, save me!
My maid was just killed!
Ah you’re my cutie,
I’m glad to help you.
De Vardes, I beg you, help me!
Save me!
- You have enemies?
- Here everyone is my enemy!
What about me? I’m your friend and ready to serve with all heart and all body
- I only need your order.
- Then you will help me!
- But we have to hurry!
- You’re right, my dear.
- Where are you going?
- To the sofa.
This may not be very comfortable, but I must fulfill my promise.
Sorbonne, come along!
I have news for you.
- I’ve seen your husband.
- You’re joking with me.
I this uniform I snuck into Bastille, saw Peyrac and found out reason of arrest.
So  you have seen him?
How is he ?
Let’s go inside, 
I will tell you everything.
No!
This is not most elegant place, but it is quiet.
Let’s go in or I won’t tell anything
Julienne, now you can return him this. 
Peyrac is locked in Bastille by the order of Archbishop.
Because of death of his niece?
Oh no, that duel has nothing to do with it.
Then because of that monk.
Yes. Peyrac was playing with inquisition and he knew it.
But Archbishop wanted a symbolic punishment.
And would’ve been satisfied with some small revenge.
He didn’t expect it to turn thins way and wanted to stop the case, but couldn’t.
King himself gave order to arrest.
But Jeoffrey loves the King!
And King don’t love those, who surpass him in any way.
- And my advice to you –  leave Paris.
- Never! My husband is waiting for me!
- We must help him get out of Bastille.
- Only executioner can help him!
You’re lying, not telling all!
You don’t know anything!
It’s not easy to figure out state secrets, but I’m trying.
Not only your husband is mixed up in here, but you yourself.
Particularly, King’s Brother knows that you keep some terrible secret, which involves prince de Cond?, you know what I’m talking about.
But to save his friend, he  may destroy you.
- This is what I’m telling you to run.
- Never!
Anyway Peyrac will be burned as a wizard at Plaza de Grev 
- But he is not guilty.
- Not only guilty end up on a scaffold.
Excellent! Forehead of Diane, don’t you find? Gaze of Venus...
And this hand, it is like a milk river!
Superb!
Step aside, I can’t see anything!
And all these delights cannot compare with you, Anne Mary.
How can I thank you!
Honor me please, raise  a finger.
Finger of a fairy!
Don’t thank me, I didn’t even have to drop to King’s feet.
He is disposed in your favor, and if you will properly use  this...
Go, quickly!
Sir, Countess de Peyrac is here.
- And you knew him well?
- He was very original.
There you go, she finally came to the King.
We must act... and immediately.
Sir, excuse me for my boldness.
Tradition prescribes me to speak first.
Decidedly, you are even more beautiful, than my memory of you.
Your golden dress, then... in Toulouse, was charming.
- But what’s with you?
- On that day my happiness ended.
- Happiness?
- Since then I haven’t seen my husband.
Unbelievable, you are so charming and cute, are you really in love with you ugly and lame husband?
He is kind, fascinating man, You had opportunity to confirm that yourself.
Yes, he can conquer women...
A real sorcerer.
This is not true!
- You forget yourself Madame!
- How can you believe rumors, Sir?
I believe in what I have seen myself.
Where does he get gold?
- He produces it from the oar.
- And produces too much of it.
So much that he decided, that to him everything is allowed.
Such luxury is not for mere mortals.
- He was richer than the King.
- He thought only about good of the Kingdom.
By being richer than everyone else?
Having means to raise an army and start mutiny?
I swear, he was never part of any conspiracies.
We are your loyal servants, Sir.
Rise, Madame.
- You are so strict not with everybody?
- Who told you that?
Leave it...
You are denying to the King, that what you allow to his courtiers.
And you believe in these lies?
This is only a whim for you.
I know, right now I’m at your mercy.
I can’t do anything,
And you are all powerful. Well...
But I do not want to wrap my hands around a ghost.
You will be thinking about Peyrac, about this devil!
Go away, I do not wish to hear about you!
- Save him, Sir, I’m begging you!
- I have already answered that. Go away.
Tonnel, watch out, that no one can come in.
You must die, Countess.
You have a choice sword or poison.
- Help anyone, save me!
- Only in death is salvation.
You won’t dare!
We hope you yourself will do the dirty work.
We must hurry Philippe.
In 5 minutes we must be with the King.
No, No!
Prefer poison?
Wonderful.
This is the best poison you absolutely won’t feel anything.
Yes, I know what poison that is!
It was made for you, and I hid it!
Exactly,
You know too much!
Drink it!
Drink!
I saved your life, Monsieur!
Don’t kill me!
Drink!
God sees everything, monsieur!
Yes, God... Well, let her pray for her soul.
Witch doesn’t have a soul! Drink!
Drink or else I...
Help! Help!
Save me!
This woman is under spell!
She is very dangerous!
By the order of the King, I must send her to monastery Saint-Honore
You’re lying!
- She splashed alcohol into de Lorraine 
- Not alcohol, but poison!
- She’s crazy.
- This was a poison!
You’re crazy yourself, cousin.
I know Countess de Peyrac.
Enough cousin.
I’m King’s brother, and you are just being tolerated here.
Go away, Go away everyone!
What are you waiting for?
I don’t leave my friends in danger.
I won’t leave
Madame de Peyrac alone.
But I’m asking you to retire.
I give you my word of a noblemen, that your prot?g? has nothing to fear.
My word is not enough for you?
This request is for you too cousin.
Don’t be afraid, dear, you have word of my cousin.
I gave my word, this is true.
But Chevalier de Lorraine didn’t give it.
Revenge!
Guards to me!
Guards!
Faster!
Guards!
Guards!
Get them!
- Run to Monteloup, here you will be killed!
- But you? You are our only friend? 
That’s why I’m staying!
Run, I will hold them off! 
Seems to me that now even me will come in handy.
Yesterday my maid was killed.
- And today they wanted to kill me.
- What prevented them from doing it?
- People on the street?.
- This wasn’t on the street, in Louvre.
They are so bored in that barn?
Good By!
I was right?
- I couldn’t believe it.
- Unfortunately.
- I’m listening.
- I’ve gained an audience with the King.
And what?
Jeoffrey will stay in jail until trial.
Sorbonne, it’s time for us to act.
Let’s go.
During the trial
I cannot receive you.
Afraid for you husband’s reputation?
No offence, But you don’t want us to be in your situation, do you.
What about baby, Madame?
Let at least him stay with you. and second one will be born soon.
- Madam, where will you go?
- It’s nothing, dear Barbe, world is big.
Where will we go?
I don’t know.
But I do.
- Where is this.
- Behind temple.
This is ideal place for you.
Police is afraid  to stick it’s nose in here.
Kouassi-B?, sell the horse and a carriage.
There will be enough for your living.
- I will not allow myself this, Madame.
- Thank you.
This is your new dwelling.
Is this you?
Raymond!
Sister, please at least respect my cloth.
You are amiable as usual, didn’t change at all.
Don’t hurt your brother. I’ve found him with great effort. He promised to help us.
- This service doesn’t allow you to smile?
- No, situation is very serious.
- When will you see the exorcist?
- I don’t want to hear about devil anymore.
- The you shouldn’t have married a sorcerer.
- He’s not a sorcerer, and I will prove it to them.
And we will help you in that.
Farther Kirsher will be main witness during trial. He promised you this?
Yes I was able to convince him.
And if Peyrac accused unjustly, father Kirsher will save him.
You are afraid for nothing, he is innocent.
Gentlemen, the honorable court.
Bring in the accused.
By order oh His Majesty, a commission was established to decide your fate. as it was before in a case of Saint-Marse.
Accused, take the oath.
I swear to say the truth, but...
Nothing can be added to the oath, or else you will be judged as a mute.
Well, it’s very convenient.
Mute accused, defense is also mute... and justice is mute.
Wonderful
Then I swear to say the truth... no matter what it is.
Prosecution has a floor.
Monsieur Chairman,
Messieurs Councilmen.
A heinous crime was committed and it contained in the sorcery.
Such crime is punishable by death, and I demand a death penalty.
Without right for appeal.
Inquisitions Prosecutor has the floor.
I tested the accused with seal soaked in holy water.
When touching it, possessed by the devil will groan and shake.
10 times I touched Peyrac,
10 times he groaned and shook.
- Is this true?
- Yes.
With the seal identical this, dear Conan Becher ?
Yes, it is classical seal for exorcism.
- May I repeat the experiment?
- But...
Give me your hand.
What is it?
This seal is an exact copy of a seal used by monk work of apprentice of Maitre Antoine, the locksmith of Bastille.
- Can I call in a witness?
- call.
Here’s a craftsman, who made both tools.
This is true.
- How old are you?
He is underage.
Guards!
- Take Courage!
- You will need courage more.
Peyrac, get up!
I’m asking, Monsieur Chairman, permission for my client to sit.
He has serious injury from childhood, and last days he underwent torture.
One supposed to stand before tribunal!
Stand Up!
Jeoffrey!
Order!
His Majesty magnanimously forbid presence of the public in court.
In case of appearance of disorder
Court will make decision behind the closed doors.
Calling witnesses of prosecution and we will have honor to convince the tribunal that accused is possessed.
Small duel.
Monsieur Germontaz is very strong.
The strongest.
First sword of Languedoc.
Impossible to defeat Germontaz, but my master...
Thank You
I didn’t force him to talk.
Gentlemen, accused, regardless of his injuries, defeated chevalier de Germontaz legendary fencing master.
And there is only one explanation of this – Peyrac put a spell on him!
To put a spell on the niece of the head of Inquisition? You’re flatter me!
This doll was found in the coffin of one of your lovers.
What will you say?
I will say that it looks just like me...
Your doll had a burial service in a church, like a martyr!
What, you consider yourself a God?
But God is beautiful.
Peyrac charmed judges, no we have to only convince them. Only you father... holy father Kirsher doesn’t doubt de Peyrac
I was sure.
And I hope, in Bastille, if only they will let me visit him,
I will be able to exorcise all devils torturing your unfortunate husband.
Opinion of the Great Exorcist of Devil will have weight even in this tribunal.
Yes, they still believe me.
Flames of Hell! Look it is tricolor of Satan! He’s Devil!
Lead, it is just lead, everything else is a Satanism and cheating...
Lucifer always wanted to change the world created by Almighty.
Tongues of fire are the snakes, and smoke is dreams of damned souls!
Peyrac!
Quit whining.
Kouassi-B?, take a bar and show it.
Don’t look messieurs, this was created by Satan himself.
Show me the oar.
- This is gold containing pyrites.
- How would you know?
I make lectures about it in the University.
To order!
Take those Satan’s helpers out.
Look at this unfortunate woman.
Peyrac wasn’t satisfied with violence he did to nature.
He also put an evil eye on a human.
I’m calling all of you to bear witness.
He is a death itself!
See, she is under his spell.
Talk!
He took me away from my family, took me from my husband!
And I can’t be without him not even an hour, not even a minute.
To save this poor victim we put her into monastery!
He breaks up crucifixes and burns them while laughing watching them in flames!
He throws them at me and burns me!
Stop this comedy! This hysterical woman is no more possessed than myself!
No, don’t touch me! I swore, that no one will touch me!
- Enough!
- I’m giving you my sould!
She foams from her mouth!
But this is just a soap!
Do you hear?
This is laugh of the Satan!
Take her away.
I think gentlemen than now no one will deny, that this woman was bewitches.
Fortunately, a hysterical comedy cannot be  reason for death penalty.
And I can assure you, gentlemen, that my client is not a sorcerer.
I have a proof.
I, reverend father Kirsher, of Society of Jesuits. official exorcist, do swear with our soul and consciousness that Count Jeoffrey de Peyrac is not possessed by the devil.
Signed on the day 25th of August
Year of 1660 of Our Lord, in Bastille.
So, the Church itself, the most concerned party, removes from my client accusations of sorcery.
Will you really prefer to the opinion of father Kirsher ravings of this obsolete monk.
Tribunal cannot trust document, which was made up especially, to win this hopeless case.
Father Kirsher himself will appear here, and then we will see who is falsifier.
I demand to remove maitre Desgrez for insulting this court.
And I demand, that reverend Kirsher was invited to this hearing.
Well, the Court doesn’t object.
Hearing will be resumed tomorrow.
Thy aren’t here...
You’re alone?
Farther Kirsher is not at his home, not in his residence, not in parish, nowhere.
- He must be found.
- I’ll go with you!
- You cannot walk anywhere!
- I will go anyway!
Quiet Please!
Hearing is resumed.
Monsieur Chairman, it is 11 o’clock already.
I believe, that the word play of maitre Desgrez was long enough. and I think, that it is time...
Monsieur Chairman, body of father Kirsher was found in Seine.
He was strangled.
This is you who ordered his death.
No, you, it is clear for everyone!
You made him to sign that document and then get rid of him.
Gentlemen members of tribunal this is murder.
Dear members of tribunal, if we talk about murder, the in the last days there was 2 attempts to murder Countess de Peyrac...
.. In Louvre.
- Are you accusing King’s Court?
- No, those who are obstructing justice.
You are insulting His Majesty.
Guards, Arrest him!
This court has no rights!
The trial is falsified!
Archbishop himself was against the death penalty!
Sorbonne!
Justice is being suppressed here!
So, gentlemen of jury
Listen to the voice of your conscience what sentence do you propose? 
It is your decision.
I’m not sure of anything.
I can’t decide.
Who is for death penalty?
King doesn’t like indecisive people and doesn’t trust them.
Peyrac... Court declares you guilty.
Naturally, I have to be killed.
And I will tell you why.
The Fronde advances and tears Kingdom apart.
Crown Princes want death of the King.
But wind changes, and King wants a commander – Conde.
He summons him, forgiving the Fronde, never suspecting about prepared poisoning.
You are reeking of poison yourself!
Fool!
To be careful, Conde drowns with gifts  King’s brother.
He must  find poison,
Conde’s spy Tonnel discovered, that poison is stolen by Angelique de Peyrac who knows about plot.
Since this moment Angelique is sentenced to death.
But to reach her...
They must first remove me...
You were removed
.. This is why I was arrested.
Way is free! These gentlemen can now make short work with my wife and breather freely.
And what reason for arrest?
Most stupid and improbable...
.. The Sorcery
That’s all.
Retrial!
I demand a retrial!
This is accomplice of Peyrac!
We are noting, monsieur from University your solidarity with the accused.
But we will fulfill your wish.
Justice is merciful.
Justice is objective Monsieur.
It is no higher us and not lower us, it is absolute.
Who is for retrial, please raise you hands.
No thank you, my friend.
Nobody?
Accused de Peyrac,
Court sentences you to death.
You will be burned at a stake on the Plaza de Grev.
I will leave kids with my sister and will go to the King again. He will pardon Jeoffrey.
You won’t enter the Louvre.
There are warrants for arrest.
- Today I will leave Paris.
- And you will leave me?
Put on this peasant dress, and I will take you to father in Monteloup.
There you’ll be able to hide.
This is impossible, she will compromise the family. I’m already being sent to exile.
While Joeffrey is alive,
I will not leave Paris.
Then take this purse, give it to the executioner on Rue de la Fermry.
- He will save Jeoffrey?
- He will strangle him, relieving of pain.
My baby!
- What is there, Barbe?
- These are children of your sister.
My husband, Count de Peyrac,
I beseech you.
30 ecu, all is good. Be assured he won’t feel a thing.
No, this can’t be. It is impossible.
Will Joeffrey really die.
- Give me your hand, I will tell your future, Madame
- It is too late..
There is someone, who can save you and Peyrac.
- Do you know me?
- Of course not.
Bandits can save Peyrac, when he will be taken to execution.
- Bandits...
- Only they can help you.
Very well, let’s go.
This is me, Barcarolle, mission accomplished.
- Look, a widow of de Peyrac.
- Not a widow just yet.
Shut up!
I waited for you Angelique.
I kept you in my sight and knew, that today you will come here.
- Nicolas!
- Nicolas doesn’t exist!
Nicolas waited for you in the forest for 2 days. 2 days and 2 nights.
Finally soldiers founded him, but he killed them, and since then he is called Collambreden
Help me!
I can of course steal even sentenced to death.
- But what will you give me for it?
- Anything you want!
Just don’t promise money or gold, you don’t have any.
I will offer you this.
Peyrac is to be executed tomorrow at 6am.
I know by which road they will take him there.
I will free your husband, and he will live.
But we two will run to America, like we decided, when we were still kids.
Promise me, Angelique.
There we will start a new live.
Nicolas!
Peyrac will live, I will rescue him.
So tell me yes or no.
I accept.
To arms!
Damn, we were tricked, this is a straw stuffed doll!
Everyone quickly to Plaza de Grev!
Probably this Peyrac was a worthy man, and they were really afraid of him.
Villains, foul murderers!
Angelique!
Here she is, that witch!
She must die this witch!
Catch this withc, and throw into fire!
Let her burn in the Heaven’s name !
Seize her!
Don’t let her get away!
Catch her, damned witch must die!
Put me down!
Put me down!
Give us the woman!
Give us the woman!
Let me go!
Give us the woman!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Well, you’re welcome to shoot.
But you see how many we are.
There are much more of us.
You’re saved.
Do you hear, you’re saved Angelique?
Here no one will harm you even the King. You are in safety.
And we don’t have to move to America.
You will stay here with us.
I offer you strength, which needed, to start everything from the start.
You can rely on them.
They are not devils.
They have not very pretty faces, but they are all good fellows.
You will become their Marquise –
Marquise of Angels.
Angelique, you will be happy yet.
You have friends.
You have two sons. And also there is still revenge. We all will be with you.
Angelique, you must live...
Angelique, marquise des anges
One cannot deny, I suppose,
that murder has its uses in society.
But I must say that in the past,
it has been pursued with more
enthusiasm than accuracy.
Explosive devices certainly went off,
but usually in the wrong place...
...at the right time,
or the right place at the wrong time.
Quite suddenly, all this inefficiency
became a thing of the past.
Murders began to be committed
with a sort of unholy precision.
A comprehensive service
was now being offered by
the Assassination Bureau...Limited.
This is from your own paper, two weeks ago.
There is only one common factor in these killings: Ruthless efficiency.
No social or political bias, just murder as a fine art.
"Mesopotamia"?
What the devil does that mean?
Personal Column of The Times, three weeks before Alderman J.T. Langer was blown up by an exploding casket.
Berliner Morgenpost, two weeks before Count von Kissen fell down the lift shaft at the Adlon Hotel.
- Our own paper.
- Good heavens.
One week before the affair of the exploding Bible.
I believe this is how prospective clients contact this organization.
Employ me, and you can have my story.
But that's our paper again.
Find out who placed it.
Get to Small Ads!
Pray, don't bother.
I know who placed it.
- Who?
- I did.
The ad has been answered, my name and address supplied.
I expect them to get in touch with me at any moment.
- Splendid. Splendid!
- My lord.
You certainly are the New Woman incarnate, Miss Winter.
I slipped in unobserved so
Miss Winter would talk freely.
I always talk freely. Who are you?
This is Lord Bostwick, the owner of our newspaper.
How do you do?
The newspaper business is a male preserve.
If you are plotting to breach the citadel, it should be done in privacy. Come.
Sit down. Sit down.
Put you to work in this office, and they'd all walk out.
But they'd leap to take you out to dinner.
Why should they ask me out to dinner?
Because you are a very attractive young woman.
There can be no sexual equality whilst women exploit their appearance.
I rigidly avoid it.
Yes, well, this lift will take us to my office.
- Allow me to offer you a little reviver.
- I touch no spirituous liquor.
I should hope not.
This is a fine Madeira.
I have a partiality for it, just as I have for adventurous women.
What, then, is your reaction to my proposal?
That this newspaper should support you to the full extent of its resources.
It is truly wonderful to find someone as liberal as yourself in a position of power and authority.
Yes, indeed. It's not at all common.
My newspapers are only a means to an end.
I have a genuine concern for the political welfare of the world.
You'd be astonished if I told you of the courts in Europe where I wield power.
Behind the thrones, of course.
I am a retiring man.
It will be an honor to work for you.
I'd like to keep it a secret between us.
- Why?
- Because, Miss Winter, if there's truth to what you say, I'd be a marked man for supporting you.
- I see.
- You'll have to be satisfied,
- with the thin end of the wedge.
- Very well.
I want your employment, and need your resources behind me.
In that case, sit down and tell me a little bit about your plan.
I must admit that one thing intrigues me.
- And what is that?
- Apart from your desire to prove women's equality with men, what is your object in contacting
- these organized assassins?
- Surely that's obvious.
I want someone assassinated.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's all right, lady. I'm used to it.
- Your matches.
- It doesn't matter.
I've lost me eyes, lady, but I've still got my pride.
Yes, of course.
"Mr. Pemberty's bowler."
Pardon me, madam.
Are you being attended to?
No. I've come to collect
Mr. Pemberty's bowler.
- Mr. Pemberty's?
- Yes.
Very hard-wearing felt, madam, from Mesopotamia.
I am sure Mr. Pemberty will be pleased with it.
Oh, I'm sure he will.
If you would care to take it, we will deliver it for you.
This way, madam.
Just through here, madam.
I must apologize for the lack of amenities, but we don't usually cater for lady customers.
However, the journey will not take long.
Whoa.
Back. Back.
Whoa.
This way, madam.
These cloak-and-dagger precautions are an unfortunate necessity.
We try and keep them to a minimum.
Forgive me. A test for our customers.
We're not used to dealing with ladies.
- Evidently.
- An interesting reaction.
Men come on gruesome business, yet without exception they are frightened out of their wits by a whiff of gunpowder.
You seem to be made of sterner stuff.
Will you please be seated?
Miss Winter, you are not married.
You have, as far as we can ascertain, no romantic associations.
Whom, other than a husband or lover, could a young lady wish to kill?
- You know a lot about me.
- Naturally, or you'd not be here.
At least may I know whom I am addressing?
Certainly. I am lvan Dragomiloff.
Oh, don't be put off by the name.
My father's Russian sentimentality has been counteracted by
- an English public school education.
- Are you head of this organization?
- Certainly.
- You look extremely young.
Oh, don't let that worry you.
I was born and bred for the job.
- That's terrible.
- It's not terrible.
My father brought me up to continue his life work.
It's natural for a son to inherit the family business.
Business? You're murderers.
Our proper title is the Assassination Bureau, Limited.
- Our dividends are quite substantial.
- You admit you take life for money.
Money is life, don't you agree?
The lack of it has killed more people one way or another than
100 Assassination Bureaus.
Human life is possibly the most expendable commodity we possess.
It's so easily replaced, and so pleasurably.
This is fantastic.
You're a monster.
No. My father only saw to it that I was educated in the logic of my profession.
- He was somewhat of a philosopher.
- I'm not interested in him.
- May we get down to business?
- Certainly. Please be seated.
Very well, then.
What about your fees?
Oh, we have a sliding scale, according to the importance of the victim.
Quality is always worth paying for.
We have very high overheads.
Since taking over, I have tried to completely modernize our methods.
This, after all, is the age of science.
Take, for instance, this little bomb.
We've just issued it to all our branches.
It can be timed to go off at any hour one chooses.
And its tick is no louder than a normal clock.
Switched off, it's as harmless as your pocket watch...
...unless you drop it, of course.
Miss Winter, please don't be shy.
Confide in me as you would in a doctor or a priest.
Whom do you wish to kill?
You will undertake this assignment,
Mr. Dragomiloff?
I shall want justification.
Of what sins is he guilty?
Pride.
- Avarice.
- Oh, dear, dear.
And murder.
He seems a suitable candidate.
You guarantee that he will be killed?
You have my word.
The name, please.
Very well, then. His name is...
...lvan Dragomiloff.
I shall need further identification.
He is of Russian extraction, though educated in England.
Physical characteristics?
Approximately your size, weight and age.
I was born in the province of Valenko.
Where was your man born?
In the province of Valenko.
I am compelled to believe that you mean me.
I do.
You puzzle me, Miss Winter.
We've never met, yet you want my life.
Why? Why?
Because of my organization?
Because you believe "kill me, kill my bureau." Is that it? Is that it?!
What an absolutely marvelous idea.
It was not intended to amuse you.
But it does. It intrigues me too.
It will let me put my aging colleagues on their mettle. Wonderful.
Since you'll enjoy it, perhaps you'd give me a bargain price?
There's one matter upon which my board never compromise, on finance.
Without self-flattery, you'll never afford me.
Name your price.
Well, I'm not my father, of course, but in all due honesty I couldn't put myself in at a penny less than...
...20,000 pounds.
- What a pity.
- I accept.
- You do?
- You will no doubt wish to count it.
But you will find each bundle contains a thousand pounds.
I trust your board will be quite satisfied.
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening.
- Popescu, good job in Zagreb.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen.
General von Pinck. Military life certainly keeps you fit, sir.
Lucoville, welcome to London.
You too, my dear Weiss.
Cesare, you're putting on weight.
Food is the greatest pleasure in my life.
Greatest? They tell me your wife is the most beautiful woman in Venice.
She is also the best cook.
And now, gentlemen, to business, please.
It is fortunate that you're all in London for this meeting.
Something has come up which has... How shall I put it?
Crystallized thoughts I've had for some time past.
Look at the great deeds recorded on these walls, gentlemen, each one performed in the course of bettering the world, purging it of evil, striking down tyranny.
In those days, you were all ruled by my father's principle that our bureau would never kill anyone without a sound moral reason for doing so.
He was a saintly man.
Do you still adhere to his principles?
Consider a moment. Be honest.
Haven't we, in the pursuit of profit, fallen short of the high morals upon which our bureau was founded?
It's always possible to find a good moral reason for killing anybody.
Everybody, from some point of view, deserves death.
Man is born to die.
No operation that consistently shows a profit can do so without answering a legitimate demand.
You say that we are justified by the prosperity our operations have brought us all.
You, Lucoville, with your string of hotels.
You, general, with your estates and castles.
You, Weiss, with your
Swiss banking syndicates, and you Spado, with your fake antiques. And you...
Oh, dear, we seem to have started our meeting without our vice chairman.
Does anybody know...?
Lord Bostwick, my apologies.
We started without you.
Forgive me. A fallen horse in Piccadilly caused a terrible congestion.
How the traffic will flow when it is all motorized.
Please, proceed, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, my lord. I wish to put a commission before you.
It is an assignment I welcome and have accepted on your behalf.
To the commission of
Miss Sonya Winter for 20,000 pounds, the assassination of lvan Dragomiloff, your chairman.
Miss Winter has put into my hands the very weapon I need.
With all respect, I no longer see in you the idealism without which we are no more than murderers.
Murderers! We are assassins!
I aim to put you to the test.
I believe Miss Winter has shown us the way to rekindle the torch we once held so high.
We won't stand for it.
It's really quite simple.
Under our constitution we have the right to accept commissions on behalf of all.
I have accepted this one.
But what does it mean?
It means, my friends, that you must kill me, or I will kill you.
Kill us?
Yes, gentlemen, kill you.
Not to put too fine a point on it,
I consider you all expendable.
Taking the honorable course,
I challenge you to this duel.
Yes, but supposing, my dear young friend, that we succeed in killing you?
Then you, Lord Bostwick, whom I appoint as neutral referee in this game, will, as vice chairman, take over my position, pending the election of my successor.
I repeat, gentlemen.
The commission has been accepted.
We must now settle a moment to begin this little adventure.
We must give you time to return home.
Some of your journeys will be longer than others.
Let us say that 24 hours from now we shall be considered at hazard.
Lord Bostwick, we'd better synchronize our watches.
Gentlemen, 24 hours from the striking of this gavel, we shall be at hazard.
From tomorrow then, at precisely 7:30 p.m.
Hardly the act of a gentleman.
But one should always applaud initiative.
Good night to you, gentlemen, and good luck.
We must go after him. This ridiculous nonsense must be stopped.
The motion has been accepted.
Discipline must be observed.
Why should we accept it?
We've given our lives for the Bureau.
- Not yet.
- Gentlemen, it's not a moneymaking proposition.
As acting chairman,
I call you to order.
Gentlemen, we have all been very loyal to the memory of our dear founder, but let us be honest with ourselves.
I think we have all felt that seniority should have counted for something when the succession was decided.
He should not have come in at the top.
- His father trained the boy well.
- Of course.
Please do not misunderstand me, gentlemen.
I'm merely suggesting that it is in everybody's interest to go along with our young chairman's sporting proposition.
In fact, I feel it is my duty as referee to stimulate your enthusiasm.
In addition to Miss Winter's fee,
I offer a prize of 10,000 pounds to whichever member accomplishes her commission.
A very sporting gesture, my lord.
No, no, no, no.
Our young chairman deserves all the credit.
He conceived this great adventure.
He is certainly a sportsman.
Isn't he handsome.
Really.
Good morning.
Shall we take a little walk in the park, Miss Winter?
Mr. Dragomiloff.
Oh, forgive the disguise.
Thanks to you, I'm a marked man.
My bureau accepted your commission.
Well, really.
The Albert Memorial?
It was an agreed rendezvous.
It was glorious in the park this morning.
- Well, when are you leaving?
- Leaving?
Miss Winter, have you forgotten so soon that you're a journalist?
- What more can I do?
- Follow Dragomiloff.
Report on his execution.
It's the greatest story of the decade, and covered by a woman.
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- Of course.
My secretary will take care of everything. Money, tickets...
But I suppose you don't know where he'll go.
Well, he did tell me quite a lot about the Bureau, where it operates and everything.
- We walked by the Serpentine.
- Miss Winter, you do want to go on with the story?
I've invested a lot of money in it.
Oh, most certainly. I shall have the greatest pleasure in reporting his...
- Whatever happens to him.
- Splendid.
Now, remember, you are to wire me personally about all his movements.
Now, to where shall we buy you a ticket?
To Paris.
Shocking.
Disgusting.
It's disgraceful. It's a scandal.
Oh! It's an outrage.
What has happened to my Paris?
It has become a sink of iniquity.
A sewer. A den of vice.
- The tourists expect it, my dear.
- Oh, nonsense!
The whole civilized world is shocked by it.
Nobody knows that better than you,
Henri. Oh, yes, my dear.
You are one of the few senators of the republic who have dared to stand out against evil.
I suppose it was my duty.
Oh, I respect you for it.
Though sometimes I must confess,
- I fear for you.
- Fear for me?
To oppose this underworld of vice may endanger your very life.
Well, it was your idea.
Somebody had to speak out.
As I've always said, if you want something done, do it yourself.
Well, my dear, I must be off to the senate.
We've a sitting that may go on most of the night.
The women of France will never forget what you're doing for them, Henri.
I hope not. Good night.
- Anything to report?
- There's not a sign of him.
Everyone has been shown his photo.
Watch carefully. He's a devil.
- Good evening, Monsieur Lucoville.
- Good evening.
- How is business?
- Up a little on last week.
And how is the new cheap champagne going?
We serve it after midnight, same price, and nobody notices.
Excellent. You have been warned to look out for a certain man.
I have his picture here.
- He will not pass.
- Excellent.
I am informed that one may find here the most suitable arrangements for the night.
Monsieur le Comte de...
Certainly, Your Excellency.
We shall arrange for you something special.
Good evening.
Just one moment.
My dear count, it's a pleasure to welcome you to our house.
- Well, madame, I am incognito.
- But of course.
You will be one of our best-known unknown visitors. This way.
Phillippe, champagne in the Swan Room at once.
Absolutely hopeless.
This one has knock-knees and this one has the most frightful hangdog look about her.
And as for this one,
I seem to remember her at least five years ago in le Sphinx.
I demand something different, something fresh.
But Your Excellency has seen the most beautiful girls in the house!
Damn it! Damn it!
I demand to see the director.
But he does not concern himself with the customers, Excellency.
He will concern himself with me, madame.
You tell Monsieur Lucoville to come here now!
And get these creatures out of here!
Of course, Excellency. Spank to your pleasure, Your Excellency, Your Honor.
Oh! Allez, vite!
Good evening. I was recommended to you by Lord Bostwick.
Lord Bostwick?
Yes, he's a very old customer.
He knows we like to cater for the English taste.
Nothing I can do will please the gentleman.
Nothing you can do. I don't wonder.
Let someone else try.
Surely this is a place of assignation?
It is certainly not a convent.
Just stay here. I'll tell madame.
How very interesting.
I must make some notes.
The count wants something different.
- Excuse me. There is a new girl.
- No, not now.
That's the most exciting creature in the place!
But she looks completely innocent.
Yes, exactly.
- I am the patron, mademoiselle.
- How do you do?
Come this way, please.
I wonder if I might ask you one or two questions.
Don't worry, chérie, he doesn't want anyone experienced.
Entrez.
Your Excellency, it is an honor to meet you.
I have found you something entirely fresh.
What delightful surprises you have up your sleeve, patron.
In there. In there.
For the exceptional customer, there is always something...
How shall I say... special.
Special, yes. The room is to your satisfaction, Excellency?
They have sent you champagne.
It's on the house, of course.
Oui, oui, oui, oui.
Where is that girl?
Where are you?
Tell me. Are all the rooms decorated in this fashion?
What are you doing, girl? The count doesn't want to be kept waiting.
Get your clothes off.
Dear, dear chairman, is this fair?
- I am unarmed.
- Of course.
You see, you're slack as well as degenerate.
I really must apologize...
It's you.
Pierre. Gaston. In there.
What's a girl like you doing here?
- I thought it was a hotel.
- Break down the door.
- Let's get out of the window.
- You stay here.
You can't leave me in a place like this.
- Your bed, Miss Winter. You lie on it.
- Shoot off the lock.
All right. Come on.
Let's cut through here.
No, perhaps not.
It's a raid. It's a raid.
It's a raid.
My God, it's a raid!
A raid, patron.
- Don't panic, gentlemen!
- What's the meaning of this intrusion?
A madman has seized one of my girls against her will.
- Impossible.
- Carry on, gentlemen!
The emergency will soon be over.
Jacques, champagne on the house for our guests!
Search the whole place!
Oh, Mallon, my dear fellow, how nice to see you. Au revoir.
We must go in somewhere.
I begin to suspect you're protecting my virtue.
I'm afraid it will have to look after itself.
You're too beautiful, chérie.
I dare not look at you.
No! No! I can wait no longer!
Quick! The stairs.
No! Don't shoot the customers!
In there, patron.
Now we have him trapped.
Shoot the lock.
It's no use, patron.
He's bolted the door.
Very well. We'll smoke him out.
- You've got us into a pretty pickle.
- I have?
- You're not here at my invitation.
- Well, how do we get out?
All problems are capable of solution.
Keep your guns ready.
Gas.
A laundry chute.
I told you there's always a solution.
- It is exceedingly small.
- Fortunately, I am not too fat, and you are positively skinny.
- Skinny.
- Come along.
We've got a little while.
Get on the floor, please.
- I beg your pardon!
- Gas.
It's lighter than air.
It fills the room from the ceiling...
...downwards.
- It won't take long.
- Long enough.
This commodious bag of yours wouldn't by any chance contain such a thing as a first-aid kit, would it?
Do not arrest anyone wearing the Légion d'Honneur!
Surely you do not wish to harm that innocent young lady.
Come out and face the music.
When they burst the door open, they'll strike these matches alight.
The room will become a bomb.
- Now, Miss Winter,
- Yes.
I thought I told you to keep close to the floor!
- Yes, I will...
- Miss Winter?
Inspector, we have nothing to hide.
I assure you that this is a perfectly respectable hotel.
En avant!
Now, open the door, lvan.
We might even make a bargain.
If I was to become vice chairman...
He's drawing the bolts!
I knew you'd see reason, lvan.
I can't manage the lock.
It's the gas! The gas!
We'll have to break in.
Quick, quick!
Break open the door!
No, no, no!
Out of the way!
I always say, if you want something done, you've got to do it yourself.
Stand back!
Champagne on the house!
Come on, you.
No use hiding in here.
Been at the bottle?
Put her in the wagon with the others.
Let me go, please!
Let me go!
I am a British citizen!
I demand to see the British ambassador!
- Good morning.
- Good God.
May I come in?
Thanks to those ridiculous policemen,
I nearly missed the train.
I thought I'd given you the slip.
Thank you, it was most considerate.
There was a first-class ticket to Zurich in the pocket.
An oversight.
Miss Winter, our rules do not allow our clients to supervise the execution of their commissions.
Oh, I'm not doing that.
I'm just covering the story in the course of my profession.
Our records didn't show you were a journalist.
Well, this is my first assignment.
Which newspaper are you writing for?
For the Daily...
For the Daily Press, at large.
Women are not yet accepted in journalism.
But when I have this story, anyone will employ me.
It will strike a great blow for women.
Well, Miss Winter...
...if anybody is to write the story of this epic adventure,
- it is only right that it should be you.
- Thank you.
And since you're to be my constant shadow, I suppose I'd better feed you.
Shall we adjourn to the dining car for luncheon?
But how can I accept your point of view?
To take life is the ultimate wrong.
- It's basic to all civilized ethics.
- Really.
You accept the gallows, guillotine and the gas chamber.
And not to mention the field of battle.
- Brandy?
- No, thank you. I never touch spirits.
Pity. Taken in moderation, it can greatly clarify the mind.
Thank you. My mind is perfectly clear on one topic concerning us:
All killing is wrong.
- And yet you commissioned mine.
- That was quite different.
You don't go into a butcher to buy a steak and question his morality in killing the cow.
Really, you're impossible.
I shall return to my carriage.
- Shall I accompany you?
- No, thank you.
I'm sure you are the one in need of the brandy.
- Cognac, monsieur?
- Please.
Thank you.
- Excellent, an '88.
- Anything further, sir?
- Just a cigar, thank you.
- A cigar.
That'll be all, thank you.
Not quite all, lvan.
Popescu?
What a marvelous makeup.
You know, these new
Leichner waxes are fantastic!
Thank you, lvan. And now there is much sadness in the world, and there must be a little more.
Won't you at least permit me to finish my brandy and cigar?
The drink certainly, the cigar will take too long.
The kitchen staff won't stay locked in the galley forever.
While you were enjoying yourself in Paris, lvan,
I was preparing this operation.
You will admit it has the merit of surprise.
What's this?
"Popescu...
Romanian businessman...
"...falls from Paris-Zurich express..."
Et cetera...
"...burns on body"?
What did that young devil do to him?
The toast is absent friends.
Lucoville was a fool.
Any business with women is bad business.
But Popescu will be a great loss.
Does your agent report where our chairman is now?
Not yet. But she is a very able young woman, and I'm sure that we shall hear something quite soon.
That idiot in Liechtenstein!
His talent lay in company fraud.
Certainly not in handling explosives.
Things are not going well, Muntzov.
I want this matter finished quickly.
Political tension is growing in Europe.
The Bureau is the instrument I need.
Weiss understands the value of money.
I'm sure we can rely on
Swiss efficiency in Zurich.
Suspect everyone!
Do you understand? Everyone.
The man is a master of disguises.
Better to be safe than sorry.
- If we spot him, what do we do?
- I told you.
Ring the bell to my office.
But on no account wink an eyelid even.
Otherwise, you are a dead man.
Right. Go to your places, everyone!
Open the doors!
Is this where they keep the money?
Well, yes, mein Herr.
What...? What did you require?
The mountains are full of thieves.
Nothing is safe.
Bad luck, lvan!
You don't fool me with this, my boy.
In Switzerland we are efficient, yes?
What are you doing?
My box! Take care of my box!
The box.
Of course. The box.
- Throw it out into the street.
- What?
Throw it out before it goes off.
The game is up, lvan.
Come back! Come back!
My box! My savings!
Stop it, lvan.
The game is up.
Das geht zu weit.
I never know if I can trust you.
Dear, you know I might be recognized anywhere.
Simply hand it in for the attention of the director.
- That's all.
- Very well.
- You're a villain.
- I beg you...
Thief! Give me my money.
They told me you would look after my money.
What do you do?
You throw it in the gutter!
I want my money!
Give it to me!
Excuse me.
- Yes, mademoiselle.
- I have something for the director.
What? What is it?
Well, she has something for the director.
Half-wit. Idiot!
My apologies, mademoiselle.
Take it, man.
Put it in my office!
A terrible misunderstanding,
mein Herr.
Get away!
What are you all standing here for?
Get back to work!
All of you!
Get back to work.
What exactly was in that case?
Purely technical details. They belong to our research department.
We have some very brilliant scientists working for us.
When they make a discovery, they deposit their secrets in a safe place.
I think they'll be pleased with the result.
There is no one in the army to match you, Herr General.
- Congratulations, Herr General.
- Congratulate him.
It is not a disgrace to be beaten by the ex-champion of Germany.
You will bear the scars of your general's saber.
Carry them with honor, lieutenant.
What is the army coming to?
- Take him away and stitch him up!
- A visitor, Herr General.
Lord Bostwick.
General, I'm glad you're keeping your hand in.
I'm just from Essen.
Alfred Krupp sends his regards.
- Can we talk privately?
- Leave us.
- You've heard the news from Zurich?
- So much for the efficient Swiss.
Ja, ja. Always one must be alert.
And to be alert, you must be fit.
En garde!
Absent friends.
For heaven's sake, stop it, Muntzov!
I've a good mind to send you back to Petrograd.
No, no, we don't want to risk any more of us.
Well, this fooling has got to stop.
What good is the Bureau with its best members gone?
The cream still remains.
Prove it, general, in Vienna.
Our young chairman is on his way there now.
- We have no one in Vienna.
- Send someone.
It will be arranged.
To poor lvan.
Drunken idiot. Young Dragomiloff is worth ten of you.
What a tragedy that he lacks the vision to go along with me.
His whole romantic notion on moral killing is out-of-date.
If only he could realize that our organization is the most lethal instrument of power ever conceived.
The Assassination Bureau is a political weapon or it is nothing.
Properly used, as I can use it, it could bring down governments, dynasties and empires.
I could rule the destiny of Europe.
Great things are afoot.
Sell everything you possess, my friends, and buy shares in armaments.
Krupp, Skoda, Vickers-Armstrong.
Take your pick.
Europe is already in ferment!
- Good morning, Miss Winter.
- Good morning.
- You evidently sleep well in Vienna.
- A luxury I appreciate.
Our bureau hasn't a branch here.
A day off is a pleasant prospect.
Are you impressed with the emperor's forces? Thank you.
How ridiculous men are. All this dressing up and rattling of sabers.
Who's that barbarous gentleman taking the salute?
Prince Ferdinand of Ruthenia.
He's Austria's Balkan puppet.
He's here in Vienna to be impressed by his master's military might.
When will we learn that force is meaningless?
Never. After all, you're paying to have me killed because you believe that you are right and I am wrong.
It's nothing personal.
It's just that...
Oh, my God!
Die, Ruthenian dogs, long live Carpathia!
Long live Carpathia!
Thank you, Miss Winter.
- I... I thought...
- That the bullet was meant for me.
Sadly, I have no monopoly in the assassination business.
- Now, I insist you have a brandy.
- No, thank you, I...
Your mind needs clarifying.
You're paying to have me killed, yet when you think I might be, you try to save me.
A revelation comparable with Saint Paul's at Tarsus.
Surely that calls for a celebration.
I'm quite out of breath.
- You're a very good dancer.
- Of course.
My father liked me to excel... in everything.
Your father. You know something,
I don't think you've really grown up.
- I was born old.
- Well, maybe that's the trouble.
Now, while we're in Vienna, there's a certain Professor Freud...
Don't mention that name.
To meddle with my basic instincts would be professional suicide.
That's what I had in mind.
- I like it here.
- Good.
You wait till you taste the Blutwurst.
Where's that waiter got to?
Get me his apron.
Put the bomb inside the sausage.
Quickly, man, and be careful.
Mind the knife!
The slightest touch of metal will set it off.
Drink to the days
The days going by
Some day we'll meet again
Remember me till then
While we're young
While we're young
There are songs to be sung
And a pledge that's warm and gay
"I promise to

Excellencies.
The Archduke Ferdinand of Ruthenia has decided to visit this establishment.
It is an honor, Excellency.
His Highness wants some relaxation.
We were against it, after this morning's incident.
You must see that everything is in order.
Of course. This is a most respectable establishment.
I hope not. I told you, he wanted some relaxation.
Now, leave it to me and get out!
Lift up your glass on high
Drink to the days
The days going by
Some day we'll meet again
Remember me till then

There are songs to be sung

- The Blutwurst.
- Here we are, mein Herr, the riesen Blutwurst, the greatest delicacy in all Vienna.
The pigs for the Blutwurst are bred here in our Vienna woods.
They were slaughtered only this morning.
The blood must be quite fresh.
Yes, yes.
In Vienna we have the best of everything.
Enjoy yourselves.
And drink it down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Lift up your glass on high
Drink to the days
The days gone by
Waiter!
Some day we'll meet again
Remember me till then
Lift up your glass on high
A sausage! But what did I say?
This is indeed a place of fun!
Excellency, apologies. Allow me.
No, no, no. Put it on the table.
The Blutwurst is my favorite dish.
Bring me a knife.
- Come on!
- But why? Why are we going?
You're acting completely like a lunatic!
It was just warming up in there.
Evidently.
- That poor man.
- Archduke Ferdie?
Waste no tears on him.
A petty tyrant, if ever there was one.
An historic event. You should make an excellent journalist.
You're always on the spot.
- But that bomb was meant for you.
- Precisely.
I thought you said the Bureau had no one here in Vienna.
They sent someone.
I wonder how they knew I was here.
Perhaps you've been followed.
- Indeed. I have, my dear. By you.
- Me?
At Lord Bostwick's command, no doubt.
How did you know?
He said not to say...
He also didn't tell you he's vice chairman of our bureau.
Lord Bostwick?
- I can't believe it.
- A man of many parts.
- He's a villain.
- Well, he'll hear no more from you.
On the contrary. I intend to keep him fully informed.
You what?
I want to know exactly why he wants control of the Bureau.
I shall wire him at once you're on your way to Venice.
Can't you make any more of it than this?
- There's nothing but facts!
- We mustn't inflame the situation.
Ruthenia and Carpathia are puppets!
Russia and Austria pull the strings.
So punch in some big headlines:
"Russia Warns Austria"!
"Austria Warns Russia"!
"The Kaiser Summons his General Staff"!
You have private sources of information?
Of course. So get on with it, man.
We're running a newspaper.
Give them news!
This is a stroke of luck, Muntzov.
Ferdinand's death is the spark
I needed. Cheer up.
To a Russian, death is a serious matter.
- Life is no joke, either.
- But time is running out.
I've got my new members picked.
But I need the Bureau in my hands now.
We must make sure once and for all in Venice.
Thank heaven for Cesare Spado.
He has all the skill of the Borgias.
All my friends in London tell me
I'm getting a little fat.
I can't resist.
My dearest one! You haven't put vanilla in the zabaglione!
You know how I dislike it!
Nonsense, Cesare.
Just peel of tangerine.
I prepared it myself.
There's not a drop of vanilla in it.
I can taste it distinctly.
There is positively no vanilla in the zabaglione.
Taste it again.
Perhaps you're right.
Eat it up now or I shall be very offended.
I will not speak to you.
Or let you...
No, no, no.
Eleanora, my angel...
It's delicious.
I tell everyone your cooking is supreme.
The taste has quite disappeared.
You've outdone yourself, my darling.
Eleanora, my dear, it's just possible that a man with whom I have business connections may call here.
- I would prefer not to see him.
- As you wish.
His name is Dragomiloff, but he may not declare himself.
I would like you to describe carefully anyone who may call.
What a dreadful fuss.
This is our finest view, the room Signor Dragomiloff always prefers, signora.
You will see the sun rise up behind the Santa Maria della Salute.
- A sight never to be forgotten.
- A little misunderstanding.
I am not a signora and therefore require a separate room.
Scusi, signorina.
What a pity.
I hope you have another equally delightful room.
The room, yes, signor.
The view, no.
- I have only a room at the back.
- Then she must have this room.
- Oh, no.
- No, I insist.
Take my luggage to whatever room.
I'll see you later.
It is a very delightful room, signor.
You will be most comfortable.
I'm sure I will.
Thank you very much indeed.
Well, it seems we have a married look.
Because you're after my blood, no doubt.
Don't talk nonsense.
We've got no time to waste.
- What are you doing?
- Can't be too careful.
My dear friend Spado might have left me a welcoming present.
That's all clear.
Bombs aren't the Italian line.
They prefer more subtle methods.
Well, the sooner you talk to him the better. Isn't it time you left?
Miss Winter.
Since our relationship became less formal,
I observe a tendency on your part to nag.
- Sometimes you can be very irritating.
- I have been told that.
Stay here until I return, understand?
Absolutely no one is allowed in.
If you sleep, lock the windows.
The balcony's an easy climb.
To be on the safe side,
I will lock you in and keep the key.
But this is absurd.
If Spado is so dangerous, how can you hope to win him over to our plan?
Cesare and my father were very close.
I doubt he'd go the way of the others had it not been for such a demanding wife.
- As usual, the woman gets the blame.
- Not without good cause, I gather.
I'm told that Signora Spado has considerable charms and doesn't hesitate to use them.
She hasn't your high principles.
Your self-denial is really quite remarkable.
A woman's beauty can be a lethal weapon.
- My God.
- My darling, what can it be?
Is it something you have eaten?
It's working.
The poison, it's doing its work.
Poison?
What are you saying, Cesare?
How could he have managed it?
He? Who are you talking of, my darling?
The son of my old friend and comrade.
I had arranged his death, but he has got me first.
- Cesare, you're delirious.
- There is so much I must tell you.
Lie still.
Angelo has gone for a doctor.
You must hear it all.
This business I am in with this man Dragomiloff, it is called...
...the Assassination Bureau.
This Englishman lord will pay 10,000 pounds for this man Dragomiloff's death?
Pieces of silver.
Pieces of silver.
Many pieces.
Can you forgive me?
It was for you that I did these dreadful things.
But you are so tender, so innocent.
What can you know of assassination?
Life flows along
Just like a boat on a river
All that I want is to
Find a place
Safe in the harbor
Of love's embrace
Good evening.
- Forgive my entering unannounced.
- Who are you?
- A friend of your husband.
- My husband is away.
Strange.
He knew I was coming.
We had some business to do together.
You... You haven't told me your name.
My name is...
...lvan Dragomiloff.
Signor Dragomiloff.
I've heard him talk so often about you.
I feel we are old friends.
Me too.
I have heard much about you.
Cesare is a... A lucky man.
May I ask you where he has gone?
I don't know.
He's just, well, floating around.
Since you are alone, my presence might compromise you.
- Perhaps I should go.
- No, no. We'll have a glass of wine.
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.
How much do you know about his business?
Oh, nothing.
Well, then, you'll hardly be able to make up for his absence, will you?
I wouldn't say that.
Will you think me very wicked if I confess to being pleased that Cesare is away?
I would think you very flattering.
But that's not the reason why you made away with him.
I what?!
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.
How dare you accuse me of such a thing!
Let's not have melodramatics.
I saw your handsome gondolier dispose of the body.
Now please sit down.
Perhaps we can come to some arrangement.
One moment.
Angelo, I must deal with him.
- You have a man in.
- Not for long.
- Long, short, what is the difference?
- Don't be a fool.
He knows. He saw you.
He could destroy us.
- Then I will fix him.
- I will.
My way.
Go and prepare the gondola, then wait.
I will ring when it is done.
It will be quick this time.
You can't prove your ridiculous accusation.
I hope I won't have to.
We have plenty of time to talk it over.
Then let's have another glass of wine.
Please, close the window.
The night has grown chilly.
Even if what you say was true, wouldn't I have been merely doing your job for you?
You said you knew nothing of your husband's business.
Perhaps it is now my business.
I'm sure that you'll handle it very capably.
Thank you.
Please draw the curtains.
It appears we understand each other well.
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.
I told you I could take my husband's place.
What a delightful little table, like a wheel of fortune.
Our fortunes, it seems, are to be linked.
- Shall we drink to that?
- I...
- I can't drink to the unknown.
- You're not adventurous.
I drink to it.
Bellissima.
Get rid of him.
What a pity.
He was so young.
All that I want is to
Find a place
Safe in the harbor
Of love's embrace
How sweet...
Fortunately, I kept wicket for Eton.
- Oh, don't worry, I've turned it off.
- It...
It was on the canopy.
Splendid. I knew these new time bombs would come in useful.
Can't you talk anything but shop?
I've nearly been killed.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I am sorry.
I'll never forgive myself.
This room was meant for me.
I should never have left you here.
What on earth are you doing in that ridiculous costume?
I forgot.
I regret to have to inform you that lvan Dragomiloff is now dead.
- What?
- Yes, events took an unexpected turn.
However, the first part of our plot has been achieved.
- You mean they think you're dead?
- Precisely.
I shall now have to disappear into hiding.
And the rest, Miss Winter, is up to you.
Now, that's what I call a really pretty dress.
Miss Winter.
Miss Winter, surrender.
Why not?
Surrender is no defeat...
...for a woman.
My friend has not returned to the hotel.
He's been out all night.
I'm desperately afraid he was run over.
- In Venice, signorina?
- Well, fallen in a canal, anything.
- Please, you must help me.
- Of course, signorina.
- The name of your friend?
- Dragomiloff.
Ivan Dragomiloff.
One moment, signorina.
Signorina, I am sorry.
- I fear I have very bad news.
- What?
- What is it?
- Your friend.
There must have been an accident.
He has been drowned.
His body has been taken from the canal.
- I'll be all right.
- There were papers with his name.
But we would like you to identify the body, if you are able.
- Very well.
- Please come this way, signorina.
It is...
...he.
This way, signorina.
It... It... It is him.
- Yes, we found papers on the body.
- Was Dragomiloff a good friend?
He was the best friend my husband had.
We were very close.
We will save you any more pain, signora.
I would be very glad if he could be brought to my palazzo.
It is not fitting that such a man should lie here.
Whatever the signora desires.
We salvaged the gondola, signora.
But alas, there is as yet no sign of the gondolier.
Poor Angelo.
Poor Angelo's clothes fit you perfectly.
A little tight, perhaps, because you are more muscular.
I prefer that.
Go to the undertakers.
I want this gruesome thing removed as soon as my guests have paid their respects.
Well, come along, Piero.
Get on with it.
I hope you're not going to take liberties.
Miss Winter?
Miss Winter,
I hardly recognized you.
- My congratulations.
- Lord Bostwick.
I came as soon as I received your telegram announcing his death.
May I introduce an associate of mine,
Baron Muntzov.
Well, my dear young lady, the press has once again shown itself to be the conscience of the nation.
Your story will be syndicated all over the world.
Come, we will go directly to Spado's house, and pay our respects to the dead.
At Spado's house?
But his body is at the morgue.
As I so often find, my information is more up-to-date than my reporters'.
Signora Spado's had the coffin taken to her palazzo.
My lord. My lord.
I've just arrived from Berlin, the news is grave.
Dragomiloff has gone just in time.
Miss Winter, may I introduce
General von Pinck.
Collect the luggage and bring Miss Winter.
The general and I will go on ahead.
We have important matters to discuss.
There's mobilization.
I must return tonight.
Will there be war?
Not yet, the kaiser's proposing a secret peace conference.
- Indeed.
- He goes to Ruthenia for the funeral, and that's where the conference will take place.
They will all be there:
The English king. Tsar Nicholas.
The president of France.
The Austrian emperor. The...
Spare me this catalog of mediocrity.
All this may suit me very well.
Signora Spado, my greetings and congratulations.
My colleague, General von Pinck.
My husband is away.
I had to act on his behalf.
It's hard to believe a beautiful lady succeeds where many men failed.
We should invite you onto the board.
Thank you, Lord Bostwick.
But I don't think it is suitable for an Italian lady to practice murder professionally.
I will be content with the reward you have so kindly offered.
And you shall have it, dear lady.
So there he lies.
Poor lvan.
He was too young to see the potentialities of his inheritance.
Requiescat in pace.
Ivan killed by a woman, that's droll.
I believe Spado's house is quite beautiful.
As with so many things, first impressions are the worst.
This way, signorina.
And so you see, my dear signora, this young lady has served her purpose and must be disposed of.
Miss Winter, Muntzov has been monopolizing you.
Signora Spado, this is Miss Winter, whose commission you executed on behalf of your husband.
If you'll excuse me, I'll make a room ready for the discussion.
No, no, no.
This will do splendidly.
The presence of our ex-chairman will be a spur to our deliberations.
You openly admit you are a member of the Bureau?
A member?
Thanks to you and Signora Spado,
I am now the chairman.
What a journalist you would have made.
In at the death of the old Bureau and the birth of the new.
Unfortunately, you must also be its first victim.
Dispose of her, Muntzov.
It's time you did something useful.
This way.
Take her below.
There are steps to the canal.
Don't make any false moves.
I'm a dangerous man.
Go to that wall, please,
Miss Winter.
If you would please face the wall, my dear.
We Slavs are so temperamental.
Somehow, I don't feel like it at all today.
So you're a coward as well as a murderer.
I don't seem really to care for killing people anymore.
Keep quite still, Miss Winter.
It's best to make a clean job of it.
Ivan.
What on earth?
- I'm in mourning.
- For your lost principles, I presume?
You look like you're got up to seduce an archbishop.
- Don't you like it?
- Oh, I'm turning in my grave.
Will you at least get rid of that preposterous hat.
- How dare you!
- That's better.
At any rate, you played your part admirably.
See what results the report of my death produced.
- It nearly produced mine.
- It's brought them here, as I knew it would.
Now we see whether
I can learn more dead than alive.
But the coffin in the room upstairs, who's in it?
The man you identified as me, of course, her gondolier.
- Muntzov!
- Come on.
Muntzov, where are you?
- Where could that idiot go?
- He'd be here.
The secret stairs from my apartments lead down to that landing.
A girl, even Muntzov couldn't fail.
He evidently did.
And the girl's hat.
- If he killed her, then...
- Then who killed him?
- I want to see inside that coffin.
- Oh, no.
- And why not, signora?
- You're not squeamish, surely?
Take off the lid.
- Please, don't disturb the dead.
- Be silent.
Replace the lid.
My apologies, signora.
You've done your job well.
Don't worry, signora.
He can't get away.
General, I will return to Germany.
Where will your headquarters be?
At my hunting lodge at Rothenburg.
The peace conference will take place across the frontier in the Castle Minsk.
Convenient. I'll summon the Bureau members to meet us at Rothenburg.
- But my staff will be there, officers.
- Of course, and they'll be very useful.
So goodbye, lvan.
You're going to miss our greatest assignment of all.
At my commission, the assassination of Europe.
They have come to take him away.
Make sure the screws are tight.
We'll have a glass of wine, and then we can complete our business.
Of course, the reward.
I suppose it was rather tactless of Cesare to tell me so much about your secret business.
Who can quarrel with such an excellent result?
Surely it is worth more than a mere 10,000 pounds?
Of course.
How much would you suggest?
Naturally, you would not like your affairs made public.
Shall we say 100,000?
Oh, alas, signora, we are not a rich organization.
But you have such great plans now that I have given you control.
Surely that is worth special consideration?
Indeed.
Von Pinck, see that signora gets the most special consideration we offer.
Well done, Miss Winter.
On the spot as usual.
As Europe's heads of state travel
to Ruthenia for the funeral of its ruler,
the Archduke Ferdinand's tragic death
threatens to set Europe ablaze.
Throughout Germany
and the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
troops of the Grand Alliance are
moving toward the Ruthenian frontier.
In Russia, Tsar Nicholas assumes
personal command of his forces,
as his Balkan allies call impatiently
for action.
In the Republic of France, military
preparations are already afoot.
Great Britain puts her armed forces
in a state of instant readiness.
After the funeral, the heads of state will proceed to the royal castle at Minsk.
Here, close to the Ruthenian border with Germany.
Just across the valley at Rothenburg is a German army...
...commanded by
General von Pinck.
- What do you make of it?
- The kaiser is at the conference.
- What can the German army do?
- Nothing.
But what Lord Bostwick does with the remains of my bureau is the question.
Mein Gott!
You might look all right around the board table, my friends, but thank God
I don't have to take you into battle.
That goes under the jacket, man.
The Russian anthem.
The czar is arriving.
We shall need an anthem of our own.
Remind me.
The czar.
The others will soon be here.
The time has come to make a move, gentlemen.
Are your officers safely under lock and key?
Quite safe and very angry in their underwear.
I've sent a limber ahead with our little toy.
My engineers will have it loaded by the time we arrive.
There it is, the castle at Minsk.
All the crowned heads of Europe under one roof, what an opportunity.
Now, lvan.
For his lordship, I mean, if war is what he wants.
With your ideas, I'm surprised you're shocked at war.
Not at all. It's a matter of business.
How can we charge our prices with everybody happily killing each other for a shilling a day?
Look out.
- What is it?
- A bomb.
It's so big.
What will they do?
- Drop it.
- What?
On the castle. Ride there quickly.
It must be evacuated.
- But the frontier will be guarded.
- Ride, I say. I must follow that bomb.
French president.
Vorsicht, vorsicht.
Corporal? Corporal!
What are you doing?
What is that thing?
Some new sort of bomb.
We are to load it.
Aboard my zeppelin?
What's the devil next?
- General's orders, sir.
- This is a naval ship.
We'll soon see about that.
Come on, come on, get busy, there.
Los, get this thing unloaded.
The general gave me the order himself. Los!
What the devil are you talking about?
Bombs in zeppelins, ridiculous.
Weg mit dem Objekt. Es muss
heute nicht getan werden.
Get up.
A life on the ocean wave and here we are in the middle of a forest
- with a bloody gas bag.
- You men there, what are you doing?
Do up your buttons.
Where is your officer?
- Your officer, where is he?
- He was here a moment ago.
Well, he is not here now.
I shall take over command.
General's orders.
The zeppelin takes off and returns to base immediately.
Get that thing away from there.
Corporal, do you hear me?
Get that thing away from here!
Jawohl, Herr Kapitän.
Bloody officers.
- Who is the pilot?
- The Herr Kapitän, Herr Kapitän.
- But he is not here.
- Well, I also am a pilot, Herr Kapitän.
Then why didn't you say so?
Get on with it, man.
Get that thing down here.
Careful, careful.
- Hey, you. Where's the officer?
- Well, there was one here.
- Where is he now?
- I don't know, Herr General.
- We've lost one already.
- Don't answer back.
Prepare to take off immediately.
What are you doing there, corporal?
- Get that thing aboard.
- Jawohl, Herr General.
- Where are you going?
- I must go to the castle.
You have, have you? The frontier is closed. No one is allowed through.
The castle must be evacuated.
They're gonna bomb it.
Do you think we're idiots in Ruthenia?
Evacuate! They've only just arrived.
They are going to drop a bomb, I tell you.
Oh, drop it?
Who is going to? An eagle?
Through you go.
There are no frontiers for the Sisters of Mercy.
Will you please listen to me?
Get out of here, before I have you arrested.
Heave ho.
Heave.
Heave.
Heave ho.
Steady. Good.
Up.
- Up. Up.
- Careful.
Up. Up.
Halt.
The bomb is secured.
Stand by to cast off.
Release ballast.
Cast off of it.
Cast off now.
- Set course for Minsk.
- Minsk, Herr General?
Drive and ask no questions.
Bombs from the air.
What a marvelous idea.
All those little houses down there, just pull a lever and poof! They're gone.
My God, let's go and see.
Dragomiloff!
Revolutionary idea, general, an aerial bomb.
History in the making.
A frightening concept.
In 15 minutes, we should be over the castle.
What's that fool up to?
- What the devil are you doing there?
- There's a naval officer onboard.
Get it back on course.
The captain. He must have hidden on board.
- Well, why didn't you search?
- He'll give no more trouble.
- We're back on course.
- Not too soon.
We're approaching the frontier.
Look! Look!
So, what is this?
It is un ballon.
By Jove! It looks like some sort of airship.
Nothing is supposed to cross the frontier.
It's one of those damned zeppelins.
Where's that Hun?
- Good morning.
- There you are, Herr Oberleutnant.
General von Pinck has sent word.
- It's a patrol for security purposes.
- Why was I not informed?
- Prussians do what they like.
- They're invading our frontier.
Now, then. Now, then.
Steady the butts.
This is supposed to be a peace conference.
- Starboard two points.
- Gentlemen.
Dragomiloff.
- It's impossible.
- Nothing's impossible, general.
- This time we'll make quite sure.
- Unwise, my lord.
You see, a bullet through a hydrogen balloon will blow us all out of the sky.
It's true, my lord.
Leave him to me.
He will not stand a chance.
I was the saber champion of all Germany.
En garde.
Now, here! And here!
Come on.
Very good.
Take this.
Here, here, here.
- Get him.
- This way. After him.
Keep her steady.
Don't do it, Charles. Indiscriminate destruction will engulf you too.
One death or a million, where's the difference?
We're surgeons, not butchers.
We only kill to destroy evil.
- Hypocrite. You kill for money.
- Only those who deserve to die.
- We must judge before we kill.
- Judge? Young fool.
You're not an assassin, you're a critic.
Steady.
Steady.
It's jammed.
Damn you, get out of my way.
Rise, Sir lvan.
Your Majesties, you must evacuate the castle immediately.
Miss Winter, not quite on the spot for once.
- Ivan, what happened?
- Sir lvan, if you please.
Virtue has been rewarded.
Well, really.
My story begins in London.
Not so very long ago.
And yet so much has happened since then,
that it seems more like an eternity.
At that time, I lived with my pet
in a bachelor flat just off Regent's Park.
It was a beautiful spring day,
a tedious time of the year for bachelors.
Oh. That's my pet, Roger.
Roger Radcliffe, a musician of sorts.
No. No, I'm the one with the spots.
My name's Pongo.
And you know, as far as I could see,
the old notion that a bachelor's life was so glamorous
and carefree was all nonsense.
It was downright dull.
It was plain to see that my old pet needed someone.
But if it were left up to Roger, we'd be bachelors forever.
He was married to his work. Writing songs.
Songs about romance, of all things,
something he knew absolutely nothing about.
Oh, he's intelligent enough, as humans go.
And I think you could say that Roger is a rather handsome animal in his way.
I could see no reason why my pet didn't deserve an attractive mate.
At least, I was determined to do my best.
Of course, dogs are a pretty poor judge of human beauty.
But I had a rough idea of what to look for.
Hmm. Unusual breed.
Very unusual.
Oh, surely not.
Well, now, what have we here?
Hmm.
Well, a little too short-coupled.
Nope.
I say... Oh, well I do say!
Now, there's a fancy breed.
Hmm... Perhaps a little too fancy.
Yes. That's much too fancy.
Too old.
Too young.
It was a problem. A real problem.
Well, now that's a bit more like it!
The most beautiful creature on four legs.
Oh, now, if only the girl...
Well! She's very lovely, too.
It was almost too good to be true.
I'd never find another pair like that, not if I looked for 100 years.
Ah, they're heading for the park.
A perfect meeting place, if I could only arrange it.
Uh-oh. But Roger never stopped work till after 5:00.
That would be too late.
After 5:00 already.
Fancy that.
All right, Pongo. All right, boy.
Pongo, boy, take it easy!
What's all the hurry?
Pongo, boy, slow down.
I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.
Then suddenly, I spotted them.
It was a perfect situation if I planned it right.
I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.
He'd settle on the grass, puff his pipe and that would be it.
No, it was all up to me.
Well...
At first I had no particular plan,
just anything to attract attention.
You know, stir things up a bit.
Pongo, you silly old thing! Come on.
Come on, let's have it, boy.
Pongo!
Pongo!
For a while, it seemed to work.
At least they had seen one another.
Things were going along first-rate.
But for some strange reason they left!
Come on, you old renegade.
We're going home.
But I wasn't giving up.
I was determined that, somehow, they just had to meet.
- Oh!
- Oh!
I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry. Please excuse me.
- I must say, what on earth!
- Oh, dear!
Oh, really. Good heavens. Of all the...
- Oh!
- Ah!
Oh, my new spring suit and my new hat!
I'm terribly sorry.
Please let me help you.
I'm so sorry. Pongo, you...
I don't know what's come over him.
I'm terribly sorry. He's never acted this way before.
Never mind. Never mind.
Please, just go away.
You've done enough.
Please? Oh.
Oh, I say. Here, take mine.
Oh.
Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
For the first six months or so,
we lived in a small house near the park,
a modest little place,
but just right for two couples who were just starting out.
Perdita, darling, are you all right?
Oh, of course, dear.
After all, dogs were having puppies long before our time.
Oh, that's Nanny, a wonderful cook and housekeeper.
She's such a kind, understanding soul.
You know,
at times she seems almost canine.
Roger, dear, tea time.
Tea time!
Be down in a minute
Do you like my new song?
- Such clever lyrics.
- Melody first, my dear.
And then the lyrics, hmm?
Oh, Pongo, it's her.
It's that devil woman.
Oh, must be Cruella, your dearly devoted old school mate.
Cruella De Vil.
That's it!
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Oh, Roger.
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Oh!
Cruella
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Roger, she'll hear you.
Look out for Cruella De Vil
Let her in, Nanny.
- Anita, darling!
- How are you?
Miserable as usual.
Perfectly wretched!
Where are they? Where are they?
For heaven sakes, where are they?
- Who, Cruella?
- The puppies! The puppies.
No time for games. Where are the little brutes?
It'll be at least three weeks.
No rushing these things.
Anita, you're such a wit.
Here, dog, here.
Here, dog.
Cruella, isn't that a new fur coat?
My only true love, darling.
I live for furs. I worship furs!
After all, is there a woman in this wretched world who doesn't?
Oh, I'd like a nice fur, but there are many other things...
Sweet, simple Anita.
I know, I know!
This horrid little house is your dream castle.
And poor Roger is your bold and fearless Sir Galahad!
Oh, Cruella.
Then of course you have your little spotted friends.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I must say, such perfectly beautiful coats.
- Won't you have some tea?
- I've got to run.
Let me know when the puppies arrive.
- You will, won't you, dear?
- Yes, Cruella.
Don't forget, it's a promise.
See you in three weeks. Cheerio.
Cheerio, darling.
Oh!
At first you think
Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realise
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
You're no help.
This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella
Cruella De Vil
Roger, you are an idiot!
- Perdy?
- That witch. That devil woman.
She wants our puppies.
That's all she's after.
Don't worry, Perdy.
They're on to her.
Nothing's going to happen to our puppies.
What does she want with them?
She can't possibly love them.
Oh, Pongo.
I was so happy at first, but now I...
Oh, I...
I wish we weren't having any.
Poor Perdita. Of course, she had no choice.
The puppies arrived right on schedule,
one wild and stormy night in October.
Steady, boy.
The puppies are here!
Oh, the puppies are here!
How many?
- Eight.
- Eight?
By George, Pongo! Eight puppies.
Ten.
- Eleven.
- Eleven.
Eleven? Eleven puppies, Pongo, boy.
Wait a minute now, wait a minute, 13!
No, no, no. Fourteen.
- Oh, 15!
- Fifteen?
And the mother's doing fine, love.
You ducky thing, you.
Fifteen puppies?
Why, Pongo, that's marvellous!
It's fabulous!
Why, you old rascal!
Fourteen.
Just 14.
We lost one.
Oh, poor little thing.
Oh, Pongo, boy.
It's just one of those things.
And yet...
And yet I wonder.
Look, Pongo.
Anita!
Nanny. Fifteen!
We still have 15!
Oh, Roger, he's all right!
Thank heaven.
See? He's just as good as new.
Can you imagine, Roger, 15 puppies!
Fifteen. Fifteen puppies!
How marvellous.
How marvellous, how perfectly... Ugh!
The devil take it. They're mongrels, no spots!
No spots at all. What a horrid little white rat.
They're not mongrels!
They'll get their spots.
Just wait and see.
That's right. They'll have their spots in a few weeks.
Oh, well, in that case I'll take them all. The whole litter.
Just name your price, dear.
I'm afraid we can't give them up.
- Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous.
You can't afford to keep them.
You can scarcely afford to feed yourselves.
I'm sure we'll get along.
Yes, I know. I know!
Roger's... Roger's songs!
Enough of this nonsense. I'll pay you twice what they're worth.
Come now, I'm being more than generous.
Blast this pen.
Blast this wretched, wretched pen! Ah!
When can the puppies leave their mother?
Two weeks? Three weeks?
Never.
- What?
- We're not selling the puppies.
Not a single one.
Do you understand?
Anita, is he serious?
I really don't know Roger.
- Cruella, he seems...
- Surely he must be joking!
No, no, no. I mean it.
You're, you're not getting one. Not one.
And that's final.
Why, you horrid man!
You... You...
All right, keep the little beasts for all I care.
Do as you like with them.
Drown them!
But I warn you, Anita, We're through.
I'm through with all of you!
I'll get even. Just wait.
You'll be sorry, you fools!
You idiots!
Oh, Roger! You were magnificent, darling.
He was a bloomin' hero, ma'am!
Indeed he was. A bloomin' hero!
Perdy? Perdy, darling?
We're keeping the puppies, every single one of them.
My ol' pet Roger, he told that devil woman off.
He told her off, Perdy. She's gone.
- Darling, she's gone for good.
- Oh, Pongo.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
Go get him, Thunder.
After him, boy.
He'll get that dirty ol' horse thief.
Old Thunderbolt's the greatest dog in the whole world.
He's even better than Dad.
No dog's better than Dad.
What's he going to do, Dad?
Shh. Shh. Let's just wait and see.
Look at him run, the old coward.
That old dirty Dawson!
The yellow-livered old skunk!
I'd like to tear his gizzard out.
Why, Patch, where did you ever hear such talk?
Certainly not from your mother.
- Watch out, Thunder.
- Don't worry, Penny.
He'll get that yellow-livered...
Well, he'll get him, all right.
Lucky, get down. We can't see. Get down.
Mother, make him get down.
Come on, Lucky. Down, dear.
Missed him. Missed him by a mile.
I'm hungry, mother. I'm hungry.
Now, Rolly, you've just had your dinner.
But I am, just the same.
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole elephant.
Shh!
There he is, behind that rock.
Oh, dear. He shot poor Thunder.
He missed him. Ol' Thunder's pretending, I think.
See? What did I tell you?
That's one of his tricks.
Lucky, get down.
I'm hungry, Mother. I really am.
Don't miss next week's episode. Who will triumph?
Ol' Thunder always wins!
And speaking of champions, friends,
Kanine Krunchies is the champion of all dog biscuits.
Kanine Krunchies can't be beat
They make each meal a special treat
Happy dogs are those who eat nutritious Kanine Krunchies
Perdy, we better get these little nippers off to bed if we're going for a W-A-L-K.
- We want to go, too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?
We never get to go.
Come along, children. Bedtime.
But we're not a... bit sleepy.
We want to go for a walk in the park.
- Dad, can we?
- Better do as your mother says.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13...
I'm not sleepy. I'm hungry.
Fourteen.
Hmm?
So do what all the smart dogs do
And you'll feel great the whole day through
You can be a champion, too if you eat Kanine Krunchies
Remember, friends, just send five...
Lucky, you little rascal, let's go.
There they go, Horace, me lad, out for their evening constitutional.
Oh. A lovely pair of turtledoves.
Around the Johnny Horner and off to the park.
Yeah, I don't like it, Jasper.
One more pinch and they'll throw the keys away.
Oh, come off it, Horace. We're getting plenty of boodle.
Yes, but I've been thinkin'.
You've been thinkin'?
I warned you about thinkin'.
I've got the knob for this job, so let's get on with it.
Ah, nobody home but the little ol' cook.
You just leave her to ol' Jasper.
He can handle her real diplomatic-like.
Yeah, but I still don't like it.
Here, here. Patch, you settle down.
Oh, dear.
Go to sleep now.
Close your little eyes.
That's a good little one.
Who do you suppose?
Good evening, ma'am.
We're here to inspect the wiring and the switches.
- We're from the gas company.
- Electric, electric.
Electric company.
But we didn't call for any inspection.
Yes, I know. See, there's a new act just been passed in Parliament.
Under the heading of the "Defence of the
Realm Act." Article four, section 29.
It's a law. And it's for your own safety, ma'am.
I don't care what Parliament
Realm or whatever it is says.
You're not coming in here, not with the Mister and Missus gone.
Oh, now. Come off it, Ducky.
We got no time to palaver.
We got a job to do. Excuse me!
What's the matter with you two?
You got cloth ears? I said you're not coming in here!
- Oh!
- Oh-ho-ho!
She's a regular little tartar, ain't she, Horace?
Don't you dare go up there, you big, long-legged lummox!
Now I mean it.
If you don't get out of this house,
I'll call the police, I will.
Now be off with you, you big weasel!
Now you've been gone and done it.
You've cut me to the quick, lady.
Why, I wouldn't stay here if you asked me.
Not even for a cup of tea.
Oy! Horace, me lad, I've got a sneaky suspicion we're not welcome here.
Pack up. We're leaving.
Sharp's the word and quick's the action.
Let me out! Help!
I'll call the police. Help!
Goodnight, Ducky. Ta-ta!
Those good-for-nothing hoodlums!
Electric company. Hmph!
Nothing but common sneak thieves.
I'll bet they made off with the good silver.
Why, I'll bet they took every last...
The puppies!
The puppies! They're gone!
Patch? Lucky? Rolly?
Oh! They took the puppies!
Oh, whatever will I do?
Those scoundrels!
They stole the puppies.
Police? Help! The puppies.
Police! Somebody help me!
Help! Help! Help!
"Dognapping!" Tsk-tsk. Can you imagine such a thing?
"15 puppies stolen." They are darling little things.
Anita and her...
And her bashful Beethoven!
Pipe and all!
Oh, Roger, you are a fool!
Hello?
Jasper! Jasper, you idiot!
How dare you call here?
We don't want no more of this, we want our boodle!
We'll settle for half!
Not one shilling 'till the job's done.
- Jasper! Jasper!
- Do you understand?
It's in the blinkin' papers, pictures and all!
Hang the papers! It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
- I don't like it.
- Shut up, you idiot!
What?
Not you, miss. I mean Horace!
Why, you imbecile!
Maybe Scotland Yard.
Maybe they found something.
Hello, Inspector?
- Is Anita there?
- Who?
- Anita!
- It's for you.
- Hello?
- Anita, darling.
- Oh. Cruella.
- Oh, Anita.
What a dreadful thing.
I just saw the papers.
I couldn't believe it.
Yes, Cruella. It was quite a shock.
- Is she calling to confess?
- Roger, please!
She's a sly one.
We're doing everything possible.
- Have you called the police?
- Yes, Scotland Yard.
- But I'm afraid...
- Where are they?
You idiot!
- Anita!
- Sorry, Cruella.
Yes. If there's any news, we'll let you know.
Thank you, Cruella.
Roger, I admit she's eccentric, but she's not a thief.
She's still number one suspect in my book!
She's been investigated by Scotland Yard.
- What more do you want?
- I don't know, darling.
I don't know.
Oh, Rog. What'll we do?
What'll we do?
Perdy, I'm afraid it's all up to us.
Oh, Pongo. Isn't there any hope?
Well, yes. There's the twilight bark.
The twilight bark? That's only a gossip chain.
Darling, it's the very fastest way to send news.
If our puppies are anywhere in the city, the London dogs will know.
We'll send the word tonight when our pets take us for a walk in the park.
There's no one out tonight.
I'm afraid it's too cold.
We've got to keep trying, Perdy.
Perdy, we're in luck!
It's the Great Dane at Hampstead.
Pongo. Quiet, boy!
Do you want to stir up the whole neighbourhood? Come on. Pongo.
- Perdy, come on!
- Let's go.
Pongo, you old idiot!
Come on, now. We're going home!
What is it, Danny?
Who's on the telegraph?
It's Pongo, Regent's Park!
It's an all-dog alert.
What's it all about? What's the word?
Tell me, Danny! Tell me, tell me!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Well, now... Hmm, that is something.
What, Danny? What's something?
Fifteen Dalmatian puppies, stolen!
Have they called the police?
Scotland Yard?
The humans tried everything.
Now it's up to us dogs and the twilight bark.
I'll sound the alert!
Prissy, come in here!
Coco!
Be quiet now!
Ah, shut up!
Quiet!
Will you be quiet!
Towser, what's going on?
What is it? What's all the gossip?
'Tain't no gossip, Lucy. It be all the way from London.
- You don't say!
- Fifteen puppies stolen.
There's no puppies around here, not since Nellie's last litter.
And they're all grown up.
Well, then, we'd best send the word along.
It be up to me to reach the Colonel!
He be the only one in barking range.
You'll never reach him at this hour!
Well, I can try!
I'll bark all night if I have to.
Hmm...
Hmm... Sounds like old Towser.
It's an alert. Sergeant!
Sergeant Tibs! I say, Sergeant!
Oh, yes, Captain!
Barking signal. It's an alert.
Report to the Colonel at once.
Yes, sir. Right-o, sir.
Right away, sir!
Colonel?
I say, Colonel!
Colonel, sir? Colonel?
- Colonel?
- What? Who goes there?
Sergeant Tibs reporting, sir.
- Tibs? Tibs? Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs!
- Colonel, sir...
Look here, Tibs. What's the idea of barging in at this hour?
- But Colonel...
- Hold on, Sergeant.
You hear that?
- Sounds like an alert.
- Yes, Colonel.
We'd better look into it.
Come along, on the double.
Right-o, sir.
It's old Towser down at Withermarsh, sir.
By Jove, yes! So it is. Hmm.
Well, I'll see what he wants. it be the Colonel.
The old boy himself!
He wants the message.
You'd better make it loud and clear or he'll never get it.
One long howl, two short.
- One yip and a woof.
- Two yips, sir.
- What's the word, Colonel?
- It's from London.
Then it must be important.
Yes, yes, I'll get the rest of it.
Sounds like a number.
Three fives are 13...
That's 15, sir.
Fifteen, of course 15.
Yes, dot, spot, spotted puddings, poodles...
No, no, puddles.
Puddles, sir?
Fifteen spotted puddles stolen.
Oh, balderdash.
Better double check it, Colonel.
Oh, yes, yes, I suppose I better.
Two woofs, one yip and a woof.
It sounds like puppies, sir.
Of course, puppies.
Colonel, Colonel, sir,
I just remembered.
Two nights past I heard puppy barking over at Hell Hall.
You mean the old De Vil place?
Nonsense, Tibs! No one's lived there for years.
Hold on! There's smoke coming from the chimney!
By Jove, that's strange, strange indeed.
I suppose we'd better investigate.
I'll send word for ol'
Towser to stand by.
Please stand by.
- What's he mean by that?
- I don't know.
Oh, maybe the ol' boy's found something!
Oh, I do hope so.
They say the ol' place is haunted or bewitched or some such fiddle-faddle.
Fiddle-faddle and rot, sir.
Just the same, use extreme caution.
No telling what sort of hocus-pocus you might run into.
Blast it all, Tibs.
On the double, man.
- On the double.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Psst!
- Rover. Spotty.
- Hmm. What?
Are you one of the
15 stolen puppies?
No, we're not stolen.
We're bought and paid for.
There's 99 of us all together.
Ninety-nine!
How 'bout that bunch of little ones?
They have names and collars.
They're not from the pet shops.
- Fifteen of 'em.
- We never counted them.
They're over there by the TV.
- I'd better count 'em.
- Watch out for the Baduns.
Baduns?
Those two blokes,
Horace and Jasper.
They're mean ones, they are.
Hey, look, Horace!
Watch me pot His Lordship smack on the conk.
How's that for calling 'em, eh?
One, two,
- three, four, five, six...
- Hey, Jasper.
Come on, now, give us a swig, just a short one.
Now, Horace, this hogwash ain't fit for a fancy bloke like yourself.
Besides, you'd get crumbs in it, you cabbage head!
All right.
Guzzle the whole works. I hope it gives you collywobbles, that's what.
Hey, Jasper. Did you...
Let me see. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...
Hey, get down, you runt!
And stay down!
Go on, get out of here or I'll black your other peeper.
Where was I? Nine...
Nine, three more.
Twelve and... One, two, three. That's 15!
They're the ones!
Blimey!
What the...
Horace, look what we got! A tabby cat!
How'd you like a tabby cat stew?
Or a cat casserole?
À la mode.
- What is it, Pongo? What is it?
- Shh. It's the Great Dane.
He has news for us. He'll meet us at Primrose Hill.
- How'll we get out?
- Uh, the back bedroom window.
It's always open a wee bit. Come on.
Pongos, you've made it. Good.
- What's the word? What's the news?
- Have they found our puppies?
They've been located somewhere north of here,
- in Suffolk.
- Oh, thank heaven.
- Can you leave tonight?
- We can leave right away.
I'll go along as far as Camden
Road and give you instructions.
When you reach Withermarsh, contact old Towser.
He'll direct you to the Colonel and the Colonel will take you to your puppies at the De Vil place.
- De Vil!
- The De Vil place!
Oh, Pongo, it was her!
Oh, someone you know?
Sorry, sir. There's no time to explain.
Oh, I hope we're not too late.
Good luck, Pongos.
If you lose your way, contact the barking chain.
They'll be standing by!
Any news, Colonel?
Not a blasted thing.
They're lost or captured, or something or other.
- Who knows what.
- Colonel, here comes a car.
Come now, Tibs.
Don't be ridiculous.
- They wouldn't be driving.
- Yes, I know, sir.
But it's heading for Hell Hall.
It's stopping at the gate!
It is? Blast it all!
Better see what's up.
- On the double, man. On the double!
- Yes, sir.
Take over, Captain.
Right-o, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr Simpkins.
The answer's no, no, no.
Six down, four to go.
I've got no time to argue.
It's got to be done tonight.
It must be a yes or no question, Inspector.
Do you understand? Tonight!
But they ain't big enough.
You couldn't get half a dozen coats out of the whole caboodle.
Coats! Dog-skin coats?
Then we'll settle for half a dozen! We can't wait.
The police are everywhere.
I want the job done tonight!
How're we gonna do it?
Any way you like. Poison them, drown them.
Bash them in the head.
You got any chloroform?
- Not a drop.
- And no ether, ei-ther.
Eye-ther!
I don't care how you kill the little beasts, but do it, and do it now!
Aw, please, miss. Have pity.
Can't we see the rest of the show first?
We want to see What's My Crime?
Listen, you idiots!
I'll be back in the morning.
The job better be done, or I'll call the police!
Do you understand?
I think she means it.
Ah... We'll get on with it, as soon as the show's over.
Will you please sign in, sir?
You'd better get out of here if you want to save your skins.
- But how?
- Shh.
There's a hole in the wall there by the door.
Come on, shake a leg.
Psst! Kids, follow me.
Hey, Jasper, look!
It's old Meathead.
Yeah, what do you know, old Meathead Fauncewater.
Come on, don't crowd.
One at a time. One at a time!
For our last contestant,
meet Mr Percival Fauncewater.
If the panel fails to guess your unusual crime in ten questions,
you will receive two weeks vacation at a seaside resort,
all expenses paid.
That is, after you've paid your debt to society.
Who will take the first question? Inspector?
Mr Fauncewater, could your crime be classified as larceny?
- A theft, burglary?
- Straighten out!
Form a queue, along the wall.
Come on. Snap it up, faster.
Mr Fauncewater is a burglar by trade, but in this case,
his crime was not burglary.
I'm sorry, the answer's no. One down, nine to go. Miss Birdwell?
If your crime wasn't robbery, did you,
oh, dear, what I mean is,
do something of a violent nature, that is...
Come, Miss Birdwell, we're running short of time.
So sorry. Did you do someone in?
No, Miss Birdwell, I'm sorry.
The answer is no.
Two down, eight to go.
- Mr Simpkins?
- Psst!
Hey, kid, let's go.
Could it be a violation of a city ordinance?
Uh, no. The answer is...
Hey, get out of the way, you little runt!
Three down, seven to go. Inspector?
Very confusing, I must say.
Surely, this crime could...
I'm terribly sorry.
We've run out of time.
Ain't that always the way!
Would it be possible for Mr Fauncewater
to come back next week?
Then we could finish our little game.
Good night, audience. See you next week at this same time on What's My Crime?
Ah. Oh, well.
Come on, Horace.
Let's get on with it.
I'll pop 'em on the head, you do the skinnin'.
No, you don't, Jasper!
I'll pop 'em off and you do the skinnin'.
Horace, look!
They're gone. They flew the coop, right out through this hole.
Here, grab a torch.
We'll run 'em down before you can say "Bob's your uncle."
There they go, Horace, up the stairs.
Here, puppies.
Here, puppies! Come on now.
Don't go hiding from ol' Uncle Jasper.
Oh, I ain't gonna hurt ya.
I thought we was gonna pop 'em off.
Shh! Shut up.
Take a squint in there. I'll check these other two rooms.
Here, puppies.
Puppies, come on out. Come out wherever you are.
Horace! Ooh!
It's that mangy tabby cat!
He's the ringleader!
Head 'em off, Horace! Head 'em...
You bungling blockhead!
Back here! Back here!
Shh! Here they come.
Double-crossin' little twerps, pulling a snitch on us!
After we took care of 'em.
There's gratitude for you.
It ain't fair, Jasper.
Horace, there they go!
Sergeant? I say, Sergeant.
No time to explain. Busy, sir.
Shut that door, Horace!
We'll close in on 'em. Enough of this Ring Around the Rosy.
Oh, Pongo, I'm afraid we're lost.
It can't be far.
By Jove! It can't be the Pongos.
It's the Colonel. This way.
Colonel? Are you the Colonel?
Oh, Pingo! Pongo?
Our puppies, are they all right?
No time to explain.
There's trouble.
A big hullabaloo. Come along!
Follow me!
Now we've got 'em, Horace.
They've run out of room.
What have we got here?
A couple of spotted hyenas?
Come on, Horace. Give 'em what for.
I'm right behind ya, lad.
Oh!
You clumsy clod!
Hey! I'll knock the spots off you. Let go!
Let go!
Well, by George!
You mangy mongrel!
I'll knock your blinkin' block off.
Blast 'em, Tibs. Give 'em what for.
No, Colonel. Retreat, retreat!
Yes. Yes, of course. Retreat!
Retreat, on the double!
Help, Jasper! Get me out of here!
Horace, they're fighting dirty!
Oh!
Jasper!
Horace!
Come on, Perdy. Let's go.
I'll skin every one of them spotted hyenas if it's the last thing I do.
Dad! Mother!
- I missed you, Mommy.
- Here we are, Mommy.
Oh, my darlings, my darlings!
How'd you find us, Dad?
Lucky, Patch, Pepper!
Hi, Freckles.
Oh, Daddy.
And Rolly, you rascal!
Did you bring me anything to eat?
Everybody here? All 15?
Twice that many, Dad.
Now there's 99 of us!
What? Ninety-nine?
Where did they all come from?
What would she want with so many?
She's gonna make coats out of us.
- She couldn't!
- That's right, dog-skin coats.
Oh, dog-skin coats! Come now, Tibs!
But it's true, sir.
Horace and Jasper were gonna pop us off and skin us!
She's a devil, a witch!
What'll we do?
We have to get back to London somehow.
What about the others?
What'll they do?
Perdy, we'll take them home with us, all of them.
Our pets would never turn them out.
Colonel, sir, lights on the road.
It's a truck headin' this way.
It's the Baduns, Horace and Jasper.
They're following our tracks.
We've got 'em outnumbered, Tibs.
When I give the signal, we'll attack.
Colonel, sir, I'm afraid that would be disastrous.
Oh, you think so?
He's right. We'd better run for it.
Out the back way, across the pasture.
Thank you, Sergeant,
Colonel, Captain.
- Bless you all.
- How can we ever repay you?
Nothing at all. All in the line of duty.
That's right, sir, routine.
Better be off. Here they come.
Come on, kids, hurry.
- Good luck, Pongos.
- And never fear.
We'll hold them off
'til the bitter end.
Now, what's this?
Out of my way, you barkin' haystack.
Or I'll knock your blinkin' block off!
They ain't in here, Jasper.
They're hiding in the hay.
Give me a match.
We'll burn 'em out.
Ready, Captain. Aim.
Fire one.
Fire two.
Hey, there they go, the little sneaks.
Come on, back to the truck.
We'll head 'em off in half a mile.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
- I've been thinkin'.
- Now, Horace.
What if they went down the froze-up creek, so's not to leave their tracks?
Horace, you idiot!
Dogs ain't that smart.
All clear, Perdy.
- All clear.
- We gave 'em the slip! Didn't we, Dad?
They didn't even see us, Patch!
Shh, children. Children, shh.
My feet are slippery.
I wish we could walk on the snow.
No, son, we can't leave tracks.
Well, any sign of them?
Not so much as one bloomin' footprint.
And we've been up and down every road in the county.
We're froze stiff. We're givin' up.
Oh, no, you don't!
We'll find the little mongrels if it takes till next Christmas.
Now get going! Watch your driving, you imbeciles! Do you wanna get nabbed by the police?
Ninety-three,
Oh, Lucky!
Come on, Lucky, boy.
We can't give up now.
I'm tired and I'm hungry and my tail's froze, and my nose is froze and my ears are froze.
And my toes are froze.
Pongo!
Pongo! Pongo!
We'd just about lost hope.
We have shelter for you, at the dairy barn across the road.
Oh, thank goodness.
Perdy! Perdy!
This way, Perdy.
- The dairy barn across the road.
- Come on, kids.
It's not far. Come on, this way. Follow the collie.
Just look, Queenie.
- Have you ever seen so many puppies?
- Aren't they adorable!
- Perfectly darling.
- The poor little dears.
They're completely worn out and half frozen!
They all here, Pongo?
Yes, dear. All 99 accounted for.
The famous Pongos. We were so worried about you.
Been trying to reach you.
Afraid you'd been captured.
How did you make it all this way?
- And in such dreadful weather.
- With all those little ones.
I'm hungry, Mother. I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry, too.
- Mother, we're hungry.
- We're all hungry.
- I'm sorry, children.
Do they like warm milk? It's fresh.
- Where is it?
- Where is the milk?
Come and get it, kids.
It's on the house.
This way, children.
Around this way.
Don't crowd. You'll have to take turns.
Rolly, wait your turn, dear.
Don't worry, kids.
There's plenty for all.
Ooh! The little darlings.
Pongo, a few scraps I saved
- for you and the missus.
- Oh, thank you.
It's not much, but it might hold you as far as Dinsford.
Huh? Dinsford?
There's a Labrador there.
His pet is a grocer.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Quite all right.
Get some rest and don't worry.
I'll be standing watch.
I don't know what we'd have done if...
- We're very honoured to be of service.
- We're only sorry we can't do more.
Anyone who would think of hurting these dear little puppies...
- Shh! Duchess!
- They're so dear.
I wish they could stay with us for always.
Princess, shh! Quiet, everyone.
Let them sleep, the poor things.
They're so exhausted and they still have such a long way to go.
Hurry, kids. Hurry!
Well now, what have we here?
Well, so they thought they could outwit Cruella.
Jasper! Horace!
Here's their tracks heading straight for the village.
Blimey! Oh, it's them, all right.
Work your way south on the side roads. I'll take the main road.
See you in Dinsford!
Pongo, I've got a ride home for you.
A ride home? Perdy, did you hear that?
For all of us?
You mean we don't have to walk any more?
If we can manage it.
Come on. We'd better hurry.
We've got a ride home!
Come on, children.
See the van down the street?
It's going to London as soon as the engine's repaired.
And there's room for all of you.
Pongo, there's Cruella.
Yes, and Jasper and Horace.
Pongo, how will we get to the van?
I don't know, Perdy.
But somehow we've got to.
Mother, Dad,
- Patch pushed me in the fireplace.
- Lucky pushed me first.
- Did not. Did not.
- Did, too. Did, too.
Did not!
- Please, children, don't quarrel.
- Say...
Perdy, I've got an idea.
Pongo, what on earth...
Look, I'm a Labrador!
We'll all roll in soot.
We'll be Labradors.
Say, that is an idea!
Come on, kids! Roll in the soot.
You mean, you want us to get dirty?
Did you hear that, Freckles?
Dad wants us to get dirty.
- Mother, should we?
- Do as your father says.
- This'll be fun.
- I always wanted to get good and dirty.
That's the stuff. The blacker the better.
- I'm ready.
- Me, too.
How's this, Dad?
Wait. That's enough. Not too many at a time.
Uh-oh. Rolly, hold on.
You're only half done.
Now, stay right with me.
We're gonna fool the ol' mad lady.
Pongo.
I'm so afraid.
Look, Jasper.
Do you suppose they disguised themselves?
Say now, Horace. That's just what they did.
Dogs is always painting theirselves black!
You idiot!
Well, so far so good.
Come on, Perdy. Better get on your make-up.
I'll go ahead with the next bunch.
Jasper! Horace!
- Well?
- Aw, now be reasonable, miss.
We're froze clean to our bones.
We've been out all night and all day, with nothin' to eat.
They're somewhere in this village, and we're going to find them.
Now get swing!
Do you think they've seen us?
No, but we're running out of time.
Try 'er again, mate.
Hurry, Perdy. The van's about to leave.
Better hurry.
I'll get the rest.
That ought to do her. She'll get you back to London.
Better get aboard, miss.
Hey, Jasper.
Come on, Horace.
Hurry, kids!
Come on, kids. Run on ahead.
- She's watching us, Dad.
- Keep going.
It can't be!
It's impossible!
Run for it!
Jasper! Horace!
Jasper!
There they go! In the van.
After them! After them!
Pongo! There she is, Cruella.
Hey, lady, what in thunder are you tryin' to do?
Crazy woman driver!
Pongo, look!
Jasper!
Ain't nothin' to it.
I'll give him a nudge and shove him in the dirt.
Perdy, watch out!
- Jasper!
- Horace!
You idiots!
You fools!
You imbeciles!
Ah, shut up!
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De
Roger, after all, that's your first big hit.
It's made more money than we ever dreamed of.
Yes, I know.
I still can't believe that Pongo and Perdy would run away.
Here's a bit of Christmas cheer for you, if there's anything to be cheerful about.
Oh, the dear little things.
Sometimes at night I can hear them barking.
But it always turns out I'm dreaming.
Roger, what on earth...
They're Labradors!
No, no. They're covered with soot.
Look, here's Lucky!
Pongo, boy, is that you?
Oh, Pongo, Pongo!
Ho-ho, it's Pongo!
And Perdy, my darling.
And Patch, and Rolly, and Penny, and Freckles.
They're all here, the little dears.
- It's a miracle!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!
And look, there's a whole lot more!
Look, Anita, puppies everywhere.
There must be 100!
One, two, three and four, is seven.
Two, four, six, and three is nine, plus two is 11.
- Thirty-six over here.
- Thirty-six and 11, that's 47!
- Eighteen, Roger.
- That's 65!
Ten, 11, 12, 13!
Wait a minute, six more.
Let's see, that's 84.
And 15 plus two, 101!
A hundred and one? Where did they come from?
Oh, Pongo, you old rascal!
- What'll we do with them?
- We'll keep 'em.
- In this little house?
- We'll buy a big place in the country.
We'll have a plantation, a Dalmatian plantation.
Roger, that's truly an inspiration.
It'll be a sensation!
We'll have a Dalmatian plantation.
A Dalmatian plantation, I say.
We'll have a dalmatian plantation
Where our population can roam
- I'm hungry, mother.
- In this new location
Our whole aggregation
Will love our plantation home
Dalmatian plantation home
Hello there!
Hi, vesla. Do you want candy?
- Do you have a guy?
- Have something else you can smoke.
Thin on you, I smoke.
- Can I have a seat?
- Have a train ever?
- Can I help them?
- Tullinger. Come on, full tank!
Super, normal or ethyl?
What are you doing? Get away,
I do not want you here.
What the hell is it wrong with you?
"I'm in a hurry, I said!
You are badly in the oil.
Is this how you treat customers?
You are discontinued. Begone.
Up with chin.
What happened?
Looks eaten out.
What is wrong with you?
Where did you get hold of that scratch?
Want to pay for the broken headlight?
Want to get your head broken too?
- What is the problem?
- The wreck ruined my headlight.
- Take it easy.
- Go to hell.
What do you think about it?
The driver is the poet.
All right. Come with me then I'll get you a new smell.
Come on.
What about the smell?
Later. We have something
We are going to make up here.
Do not take it personally.
Have nothing with you to do.
Do you need help?
If someone comes running out, can you take him
Hey hello, do you want a beer?
- I'm not your mate.
- What are you doing here?
- Shall give you a try.
Are you going to take us all?
Take a break now
See what you did with him.
That's fine.
Do you think?
Spark into the toe.
I asked you to wait outside.
Where do you act
Here it's closed tonight.
Sorry.
It's my beer. Why do you help? him? We just got him up.
When I was little wild
I become a nurse.
Do you get the guys to christmas up each other so you can play sister?
I have a crack in my lip.
A crack in lip, I said.
Buddy, it's not what it looks like.
You're my crap, right?
You're eaten.
Drive with him.
Your asshole.
We have all our kick, right?
Hi, Pearl.
Alright, everyone. Then we stick.
Sit close to me on the bike.
You are not so important to him.
He is sticking with another girl.
But I like you.
Do not do it.
Do you want a ride?
Have no choice.
Come on.
See you later, okay?
Do you like the roller coaster?
- Yes, joe.
- What about you?
How about you, Shill?
Do you like speed?
Yes, I love it.
Come on.
Why should I drive with the poet?
Pearl sat down with me. And three on a bike are too many.
I do not think you care about me.
I care about everyone like that do as I say.
- Go to hell!
- Fits me better than heaven.
- Look up where you go.
- Go to hell!
Shut up.
Sorry, I went in thought.
- Do not sound like an excuse.
- Did anyone hear that he was sad?
Let me hear that.
Not from me, mate.
Give them a carnival dress they look all the same.
Which fools are you from?
Hold him!
It's cowardly.
Are you going to join?
Stay away from that.
Is he worth it?
He guy ... the poet?
Yes, is he still there?
Four guests went loose on him.
Was there four of them?
Did you see the gradient?
One of them had a propeller with three leaves.
He is a mechanic. I mean his degree.
We have a nice room all over the park we find them.
Are they them?
Either they saw that we were coming,
Or they stuck right away.
We stay here for a while and looking after them anyway.
- How do you feel?
- A little sore in the stomach.
Go over to Shill and relax a little.
I want to be with you when you find them.
Just do as I say.
Jocko, get started.
Come, let's go.
Should I drive?
Sit down.
Relax she's just my roommate
You have a wild mouth.
You know what-
I've wanted to kiss you from the first moment.
Why do you say "Do you know what?"
Low self-esteem?
I have something for you.
Keep it
You're cheeky.
One moment ... and so ...
Really cheeky.
Will you make love to me?
Well?
Do not you want to?
Yes. I will love you.
No thanks.
If you want to do that, so do it.
Wait. There are some here.
So what?
Let her look.
Sorry.
Is she never talking?
Not as much as you.
Do it now then.
Sorry.
Quite square, what.
Civil morality, right?
Do you have fun?
There are too many of them.
You were not too many when you took the guy.
Just go to hell.
You killed him.
Let's sting.
Let the door stand up,
I want to see.
Did you find him?
- Yes, we found them.
Did you fix them?
- Yes, fix them properly.
One of them relaxed too good.
Do not forget that we do not was there tonight.
Could have been another gang, but it's just forgetting.
I'll take care of it.
Buddy does not know how lucky he is.
A girl with your hair and your body.
Lori, do not start again.
With what?
Nothing, pretty.
Just a little girlfriend.
Same for me.
- They really got what?
- Yes, proper bank.
No one knocks us.
No.
You should see him tonight.
A bit of a fight.
Wish I had been there.
You're weak for Shill, what?
Yes, I am.
She is awesome.
But she is angry.
One moment, nice and straightforward and next something else.
Really?
What kind of painter are you?
What kind of painter are you?
Do not know. Doseter, baseballs- places, arm hooks.
Occasionally self-portraits.
- Yes?
- Yes. I can make portraits.
Do you think so?
Paint it
Yes it.
Hi, mad me.
Shill, you are beautiful.
Why can not you be that way? when we are alone?
Can not we go somewhere and being alone?
We can try.
Why do you lock the door?
Some may come in.
What is it with you?
Are you shy or?
Do not you care about yourself?
Yes I do.
I'm not ashamed for something I do.
You're pissed on Buddy-
- and are looking to give up again.
And you will use that for me.
Be grateful for small services
You want me to fight for you, right?
If you're scared, the little one ...
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Not for me once?
Or what can I do you?
I just know I want you more than any other girl.
Will you fight for me?
I should kill for you.
Bingham is outside.
- Complain again.
- Are you bothering us again?
Hope it's not the beginning a long tiring weekend.
If we go out and drive a bit, do you bother us?
Do we have a quiet and fun party,
Do you come and disturb.
Is that what you are going to do? do your career?
Not far from.
Are you going out and running this weekend?
Maybe. We have our rights.
It has everyone else too.
Take it easy. Otherwise I'll put take you in a couple of days.
- Are you threatening me? Do you have arrest warrant?
- I'm just saying that.
That's okay, old friend.
Where have you been tonight?
I said so. We have been here at a quiet and fun party.
A guest was killed in the park tonight. Someone killed him.
So bad then.
And the perpetrator was comfy and a jacket like you.
Do you want to arrest me?
Maybe do it this time.
We'll see. Best you get ready to the big fall.
There are many who have comfy and such a jacket.
We'll see. See you soon.
- Certainly.
- Many times a day.
So be careful to spit on the sidewalk. All right?
- I will not do it.
- No do not do it.
Have it, mate.
What do you say about it? Warning from our own private purk.
Shall we drive out this weekend?
Do not want to he's going to be on the go.
It's you who decide, Buddy.
Look at him a. The purse took us almost and he has not noticed anything.
You should marry and relax a little.
Do you know what we do?
We are going to Nevada and make weddings.
- How are you?
- Good.
- Do you have a carburetor for me?
- Takes a week to get one.
- I'm knocking one. Available?
- Yes, Please.
The girls are waiting here.
Only members.
Who has my beer?
Alright, the meeting is set.
We have some things to talk about.
Firstly, the battle yesterday was self-defense.
The guy pulled that knife, right?
You really calmed him.
If Bingham or anyone comes, we do not know anything.
He's the poet guy is all right, right?
Who wants him? as a member?
Okay. Who does he propose?
I.
- I support him.
- He is a childhood pomp.
I like him.
Okay, go get him.
Third, just right.
Gypsy and Abigale will marry.
Take him, Bull.
Take him
He likes it.
Here he is.
The poet.
You are now aspiring to become a member.
Come on. Take it on you.
See how well it fits.
- Purks.
- I've seen them.
Drink your coke.
We have nothing to hide.
What's up?
Looks like we get an escort.
See how people are there with open mouth-
- and the island on the stalk.
Just like the president.
The bride must have flowers. Pick some bouquets.
- Is this a good idea?
- Cold feet?
Just a little tired and hurried.
Poet, he pulls.
Not after we have traveled the whole this way.
What's going on here?
- What is all this noise?
- Are you going to wake all the neighbors?
Not that tone to me. And you there, stay away from the flowers!
But, dear priest, they are for the bride.
All stores are closed.
Is there anyone who wants to get married?
Sure. These two nice young people.
And we will pay for the flowers.
Just the couple and two witnesses.
Wait here. Pearl will join that maid of honor.
She does not need to write under something?
I love you with all my heart from the bottom of my heart
I love you
Here you can sign like the other witness.
Please, this way.
We are a motorcycle club.
I can hear that.
We've heard that parachutists gets married in the air.
And divers marry under water.
Have heard it. It is spotting a holy ceremony.
That's your opinion.
But we also have our faith.
We mix in what you do.
I do not put myself on one motorcycle and reading the Bible.
We do not expect that.
We can bring the bikes here.
I was born faster than this.
Everyone out there is his friends and they will look at when he gets married.
Are you sure that you will do this?
Definitely.
Outside.
How long did it take? with your wife?
Is it OK?
Should I take away from you? this blessed moment?
Stand still in line as an honorary guardian.
Let's sing.
Here comes the bride completely dressed in white
Why do they make fun of it?
Who knows?
Do you, Abigale McKenna, this one the husband of your husband?
Yes.
Do you, Darryl Rickman-
- this woman to yours wife?
- Yes.
- Rings.
Do you have a ring?
Lunatic. How are you getting married? without a ring?
It's a flip.
So funny that one can cry.
As my authority
I declare you husband and wife.
You can kiss the bride.
Now it's my turn.
Rent a room for them. Have you groats?
Look, Jesse James and his ties.
Is this Jesse?
He is the leader. He's fine the best horses.
You are going to lose.
I'm not alone. I have many friends in the bar.
We just came to have a beer.
- Another place.
- You do not understand.
We do not want anywhere else.
We want to drink beer here.
Sorry, but it's full here.
- Not even a small one?
- Not a drop.
Take your smelly bastard bags and bikes and sticks.
You are going to get hurt. Did you know?
Let's make up then.
You do not understand.
Should I fight with anyone who would
I had to fight all the time.
If you want to fight with me, do you have to fight with all of us.
Nice little comfy, what?
Has Gypsy got her room?
Could not have left
Who's left outside?
Then it's just stolen.
If I left you outside you are also stolen.
They fight.
Come on, please.
I come. But it looks as they may need some help.
They are doing fine.
Do not you come to bed?
Hi Buddy, where are you going?
Squaw Rock. With Moely and the guys.
Enjoy yourself.
How do you feel?
Why do you ask always?
Maybe I'll start to like you
Beginner.
Do not leave what happened last night get to your head
Did not mean anything to you?
That was what it was.
Nothing else.
You are me a nice rebel.
Totally broken because Shill does not swear on a cloud for it last night.
- nothing to blow up
Love them and walk from them.
Is that why you joined the Angels?
So you can get down on citizens and be free?
Why are you here if you do not like it?
- Maybe I'm spying for the fool.
- Maybe you like rough treatment?
You learn.
Listen.
Could I just make you cut pisseprekenet and relax a little.
Wish you did it.
Wish somebody could.
Everyone is terrified to take responsibility.
I can take responsibility for you.
Have a beer. I like you not when you get angry with me
You are different.
I have said so. So all out
Like me, I had not been anything.
When people see me on the street, I want to that they should say:He is the leader.
Will you never grow up?
You do not need money in order to live off?
I have enough.
A little money can be done all the time obtain.
Do you just want a little?
How much do I need? I pay
$ 50 a month in rent.
I do not drink champagne and do not go to fine restaurants.
But if you want to marry one day?
Have already tried it.
And it's just crazy. Two people that cling to a paper.
What's the joke about it?
I want you now.
Do you want anything with me?
And tomorrow you'll hit other guy-
- and want to be with him.
And that's okay.
And I find something new.
I do not know if I like it.
Girls have nothing to say.
They just gotta shut up.
If you do not like it, just jumping off.
You're joking?
Yes of course.
Want a ripe?
Why not?
Ally, everyone. Come on.
Hi, I do not share you.
As you wish.
It's far to go to town.
Come on. Jump on
Get up with you.
- Do not imagine anything.
- Just fine.
Otherwise, we get out of the way over the road.
- Do you never bathe?
- A month ago. My charm.
- You're sitting with me.
- Okay, Buddy.
Hi, wait a minute.
Shill is not a potato bag.
And you're not an Angel yet, småen.
We keep learning about you.
So just relax.
Find out by yourself.
I'm still a little sleepy.
What do you have?
Guaranteed full speed.
You are a rat. A beautiful rat.
The only rat boy, baby.
That's the girl for Bull.
You delicious sheep.
- Drive to the side!
- Come on, gammer.
Idiot, away road.
Come on, get away!
Swing away.
Now you are not sitting properly.
Cut out, your baby.
Relax, you're sitting on with the best.
I can make it sit down and give a lab.
He drove off the road. I saw the dust.
Just got a hole outside.
It certainly went well.
- Hey, shit.
- Sergeant Bingham.
A welcome committee. Watch blank sign.
Do you have refreshments?
- I told you we'll see you again.
- Yes, you did.
You've been having fun?
In Nevada? It's beyond your district.
- This time it was flausing.
- Flause this time.
Not in hell either.
Hello shill
Who are you with today?
Is not that personal?
Who are you wearing?
I'm sitting on with Buddy.
I'll hold you, Buddy.
You're joking.
You were involved in an accident.
Impossible. Look at my bike.
Not a scratch on it.
You last ran with a girl behind on the bike. I have two witnesses.
They were wrong. I ran last and last
He front as usual.
He is out of control. I drove last with that pretty little girl at the back.
- No, that's the way ...
Wait a minute, I was.
Why did you do it?
Wanted to. Would not blame him something for the guests.
- We did not want to lie to you.
- Take them all together.
What is this? A guy will be scared of us and driving off the road.
Should we pay compensation, or?
He was killed.
Come on.
Wait.
They can not arrest me.
I have not done anything.
I do not even know them.
It was him. He drove last.
Well, Jocko. You stay with us.
You will not see your friends other than in prison.
You will have one to five years for this.
Too bad it was not you.
- But I'll take you for guests.
- Just try.
Do you want to tell me about guests?
Perhaps you get reduced punishment
Cut out now!
We'll see.
No hassle now.
Get off.
Do you believe Bingham
Are you looking for Pearl?
Are you involved in this?
We'll take back Jocko.
- Are you crazy?
- Should we kidnap him?
- It's too dangerous.
- I do not ask.
We wait until they are down in the valley.
Then we take them in the intersection.
They continue and Jocko is driving with us.
We explain to them that Jocko not so often in prison.
And if it does not help, we'll find something.
They are armed.
- There are many more of us.
- Are you trying to kill me?
You are too naughty to die.
Squaw Rock is canceled.
Drive towards the ruins.
Tonight there will be a party!
Hi, Moley.
- How are you?
Look here. The newlyweds.
- Did you enjoy it?
- Drink two beers and fall asleep.
Now you are joking.
I'm sticking now.
Down the beach to La Paz and forget the scorpion.
That's fine.
I would be alone.
Without Buddy too?
Without all.
You said I'd figure it out self.
Find out what?
Why you stuck so fast
Buddy waved his finger.
You took it hard, what?
Stop staring at me.
You look like an idiot.
Want to tell me what is the problem?
The problem!
The bourgeois way to say that!
A girl has a problem?
They can not help me.
I'm taking a mess on them all.
I'm one big cliché.
I want kids.
With Buddy?
Correct.
Have you told him?
Why should I do that? So he can marry me?
Do you want to marry him?
I do not know...
- Do you think he wants?
- Why should he?
- I want that.
- It's not yours.
Does not matter.
Do you want to marry me anyway?
Yes.
She is my property!
Do not you ever learn?
Do not you?
She will have children with you.
Tough. Do you plan to be midwife?
Is nothing important to you?
- You're just a damned bluff.
- Shut up. Just do as I say.
I'm not in your tires.
- Then you can just stab.
- I do not need you.
Come on!
- You got orders?
- Yeah.
Check in. Stay off the streets.
There's no liberty.
Right.
- Where's Mitch?
- He died a couple of months ago.
- What happened?
- Just didn't wake up one morning.
I was a shipmate of his. Name's Baxter.
Ex-chief signalman. I took over.
- Everything?
- Yeah, everything.
Gimme a UB of whiskey.
- He was all right, though.
- They start liberty again?
Nah. Transferrin' to a new ship.
The San Pablo.
You can have my part of that.
Them gunboats are nothin'.
- Well, they got engines, ain't they?
- Sure.
Well, then they ain't nothin'.
- You likee me?
- Oh, much like all the sailor man!
Uniform gets 'em every time.
We can't threaten them into being our friends.
- Exactly.
- Then what's the point?
Now, you can hate the gunboats and what they represent, Jameson, but you missionaries are only tolerated because we have them.
- I question that.
- The Chinese'd run you out, otherwise.
They hate you and despise you.
Dare you know that?
I dare love them in return, and I dare trust God rather than guns.
Yes, but when there are anti-foreign riots, how often have you fled to the gunboat for protection?
To my shame, twice. But never again.
My name is Hamilton.
- Holman.
- How do you do? This is Miss Eckert.
And Mr Jameson. As you may have gathered,
Mr Jameson is a missionary. Miss Eckert, too.
- And this is Mr Outscout.
- How do you do?
British.
- Where are you headed?
- Uh, San Pablo. Gunboat.
Well, if I were you,
I'd jump overboard while I still had time.
- Do you know anything about her?
- Uh-uh.
American gunboats in central China are a painful local joke, Mr Holman.
- And the most painful is the San Pablo.
- Oh, yeah?
I think she's something you chaps inherited from Spain after the Spanish-American War.
Well, I missed that one.
They don't let her on the Yangtze proper.
They keep her up in some small river.
You must know her.
She operates near Changsha.
- Yes. We know her.
- Mr Jameson dislikes gunboats.
Whatever flag they fly.
English, French, American...
Symbols of what the great powers did to this nation.
Nation? Don't be ridiculous.
It's a patchwork quilt of bandits, warlords, mobs, rape, loot and chaos.
China will be unable to put her own house in order until she is free of your enslaving, unequal treaties.
Foreigners collecting her taxes, placed in charge of her Customs, postal system...
Foreigners enjoying immunity from her laws.
Would we tolerate a Frenchman who had committed a crime in America not to be tried in our courts?
You know Chinese justice.
Confessions by torture, corruption...
Have you seen the executioner of the warlords walk through the streets? "Oh, you."
"Ah. You!"
Well, do you think that's funny?
Well, you do it kinda funny.
Yes, those things happen.
But they're trying.
Responsible Chinese leaders are trying to put their house in order.
- From the south, the Nationalist Party...
- Mobs, that's all I see. Mobs that threaten us.
Confusing, isn't it? And painful.
I bequeath China and her agonies to you youngsters, with pity, and with the hope that perhaps
you can understand what's going on, can comprehend what so many people are going to have to die for.
The good, the bad... the innocent.
- Excuse me, sir, but you're talking rot.
- Conceivably.
A firm hand, that's what's needed.
That's what you're doing here.
Hey. Listen, I run the engine.
All this other is just "looksee-pidgin".
- I beg your pardon?
- To make a show. Something for the officers.
I don't fool with it.
Oh, don't stop.
I can't do no more.
Just butterflies and rabbits.
Is this your first trip upriver?
Yeah.
Did you understand what they were talking about last night?
- Politics.
- I'd like to know more.
I'm not a missionary, I'm a teacher. And if I'm going to teach, I ought to know more.
You gonna try to teach the slopeheads?
Yeah.
I taught back home in high school.
Vermont.
- Where's your home?
- Well, I was born in Grover, Utah.
But my home's whatever ship I'm on.
You're an engineer, huh?
I'd have thought the engine on a large ship is more interesting than the one on a gunboat.
Too many guys tryin' to tell you how to run it.
Ah.
See, on a small ship you haven't got any of that military crap.
They, uh... They leave you alone.
I had a brother in the navy during the war.
He was a lieutenant in the reserve.
Uh-huh?
- How long have you been in the navy?
- Nine years.
- And out here?
- Seven.
See, most China sailors, they don't go back.
They pull their 20, 30 years and shack up with a Chinese girl, open up a bar.
I see.
I mean, I keep asking myself the same question about what I'm doing here.
I'm kinda frightened.
It may be romantic, but I wanted to be swept up by something.
One night, Mr Jameson showed coloured slides in the basement of the church.
Slides of his mission, China Light.
- How long you sign up for?
- Seven years.
Well, those slopeheads could use some teaching.
I hope you're good at it. Long as you're good at something, they can't bust you down.
Like me, you know, with the engine.
The Reverend'll probably tell you that nice
American girls don't talk to China sailors.
It's not your brother's navy.
I'm sorry if I've embarrassed you.
No.
Goodbye.
I can't help feeling a sort of sadness about his life.
Yes, it would be sad - if he wanted something else.
They don't. They reduce life to a very simple point, or no point at all.
As long as they obey orders, the navy takes care of them.
The way of life appeals to a certain kind of man.
Go.
- Hello. I takee.
- I got it.
- I takee all gear sailor man.
- OK! Takee.
- OK.
- Takee!
- That guy sure likes to carry things.
- Ah, it's his rice bowl.
You must be Holman, huh?
We was wondering when you'd get here.
Well, Shanghai slowed me up a little bit.
Had a hell of a time tryin' to find you.
Oh, we only come down to civilisation every couple of years for overhaul.
Welcome aboard the Sand Pebble.
That's what we call her. We're Sand Pebbles.
- Frenchy Burgoyne.
- Yeah. Hey, you got an engineerin' officer?
No, just the skipper and the exec.
You'll be the senior engineering rate.
- Yeah?
- Wong will show you your bunk.
I wanna look at the engine first.
All thing proper. You makee looksee, master.
Any side proper. All OK.
Hello, engine.
I'm Jake Holman.
Coffee, sailor man?
Ah. Good boy, Wong.
Through with the butter?
Welcome aboard. My name's Bronson.
- Hiya.
- Hey, what's your name, buddy?
- Holman.
- Stawski. Machinist's mate.
- That's Farren. Bosun's mate, second class.
- Howdy.
- The redhead is Shanahan, ship's writer.
- Yeah, that's me. Red Dog.
- Red Dog "bite 'em in the butt" Shanahan.
- Red Dog, cut it out!
- Jennings, pharmacist's mate.
- Hey, Holman.
When you meet those pigs at the Red Candle at Changsha, the doc's a man's best friend.
Right, Crosley?
Say, Holman, what was your last ship?
Flagship. Asiatic fleet.
- Harris, electrician. Navy's foulest mouth.
- So don't get me started.
- What do you want for breakfast? Tell Wong.
- Eggs.
- Sure. How many?
- Half a dozen?
- You got 'em. Over easy, or what?
- Yeah, over easy.
- Ham?
- Yeah.
- OK, Wong?
- OK.
The old Sand Pebble ain't much to look at, but she's sure as hell a home and a feeder.
- Yeah, she sure is, Frenchy.
- Tell him all about it.
Hey, Holman.
Clip-Clip here does all the shaving.
I like to do my own shavin'.
It's his rice bowl.
Don't wanna break nobody's rice bowl.
OK.
- Attaboy, Clip-Clip.
- Great breakfast this morning, huh?
Let's go! Come on.
Come on, come on, come on.
Move it, move it. Come on!
Fall in at attention. Let's go. Hup!
Come on, come on, come on, come on! On the double!
Let's go! Fall in at attention.
Dress right!
Front! Answer to muster!
- Holman! Burgoyne!
- Banks!
- Perna! Shanahan!
- Ho!
- Colgate! Troys!
- Here!
- Crosley!
- MacDonald!
- Haythorn!
- Here!
- Report!
- Deck and gunnery divisions all present, sir.
Engineering and navigation all present or accounted for, sir.
- Ship's company all accounted for, sir.
- Very well.
- Posts!
- The clock reads eight, Captain.
Make it so.
Ten hut!
- Dismiss the ship's company.
- Aye aye, sir.
All right, Chief, dismiss the men.
- Fall out and turn to.
- Fall out.
Holman. Welcome aboard. I'm Wellbeck, your mustering Chief Petty Officer.
Did you look at the new man's records,
Mr Bordelles? What did you think?
Well, he seems to be a first-rate engineer, sir.
- You take a good look at his service record?
- Yes, sir. Nothing but 4.0 marks.
In everything except leadership.
And he's had seven transfers in nine years.
It's almost time for battle drill, sir.
What shall we run this morning?
- Repel boarders starboard.
- Yes, sir.
All hands, repel boarders starboard!
- Repel boarders!
- On the double, Holman.
You help man the hose in the waist party.
I'm Chief Franks.
OK, grab this.
Waist party manned and ready, sir.
Stand back, you slope-headed slobs!
Stand back, you slobs! Stand back!
Go! Go!
Stand by on that hose!
All right. Cut her in down there.
- Secure from drill!
- Secure from drill!
Secure from drill!
- You do this a lot?
- Every day except Sunday.
Well, what do you do Sundays?
Turn a machine gun on 'em?
Come on.
Master!
All of you. Go back to work. Go back to work.
Continue. Continue.
- You, uh...
- Po-han, master.
I wanna looksee the bilge side.
Take up the floor plate. Savvy?
- Me savvy.
- Bilge pidgin no can do.
Today must washee port side.
- Who the hell are you?
- Chien. Boss coolie. No can do bilge pidgin.
Yeah? I do bilge pidgin. Looksee pipes.
Learn pidgin all pipes. Savvy?
This ain't the Chinese Navy. Take it up.
Master! Master!
Hey, shut it off! Shut it off!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! What the hell is wrong?
- That boss coolie's gonna get his head bent.
- What?
- He blew the glass on me in the bilges.
- Oh, take it easy.
We always blow the glass when the watch changes.
- You do, huh?
- Yeah.
He probably didn't even know you was there.
He knew.
We don't never go in the bilges. And if you want Chien's respect, stay out of 'em.
- I don't care if that slopehead respects me.
- Well, you better!
- We couldn't get along without him.
- Well, by God, I can get along without him.
- Who works for who around here?
- Oh, it's a system they got.
If you want a bilge coolie, go through Chien.
For a deck coolie, go through Pappy Tung.
The boss of all the coolies is Lop-eye Shing.
He's kind of captain.
- Like Collins is with the crew.
- Yeah?
- How the hell did they get this thing started?
- Oh, a long time ago, before I shipped on.
The sampans'd gang around the slop chutes, and the Chinese'd fight for the garbage.
Well, that was no way, so finally the cook gave one sampan the contract. Hey, come on.
Relax, huh?
Soon, they wasn't only collectin' it, they was scrapin' and washin' dishes.
In a week, every mess cook had a Chinese helper to do all the work.
Next thing, they were sleeping in the galley passageways.
Then they was with the ship for good, in all the departments.
- Course, it ain't official.
- Hey, how do they get paid?
Oh, squeeze. Little here, little there.
Uncle Sam don't miss it. You got a minute?
- Yeah.
- Come on. I'll show you.
They live in the old crew's quarters.
We never come in here.
The Captain don't even inspect it.
Oh, come on.
He's lost enough face for one day.
If you wanna hit one of them, kick him.
Never touch him with your hand.
Don't get buddies with a coolie.
That's trouble.
- And they do all the work?
- Sure.
That leaves us free for standing topside watches and our primary duty.
Black gangs ain't supposed to stand topside watches.
- On this ship, everybody.
- What is our primary duty?
- Fightin'.
- Who do we fight?
Nobody. Probably never will. But, like the skipper said, we're always ready.
Look, Jake, we got it good here, huh?
I didn't come all the way from the fleet to have it good. I'm an engineer.
Look, I told you. Let Chien handle the engine.
He'll keep it in shape. He knows it inside out.
Relax, huh?
Today we begin cruising to show the flag on
Tungting Lake and the Hunan Rivers.
I want all honours rendered smartly.
At home in America, when today reaches them, it'll be Flag Day.
For us who wear the uniform, every day is Flag Day.
It is said there will be no more wars.
We must pretend to believe that.
But when war comes, it is we who will take the first shock, and buy time with our lives.
It is we who keep the faith.
We serve the flag.
The trade we all follow is the give-and-take of death.
It is for that purpose that the people of America maintain us.
Any one of us who believes he has ajob like any other, for which he draws a money wage, is a thief of the food he eats, and a trespasser in the bunk in which he lies down to sleep.
Mr Bordelles, make preparations for getting underway.
- When was the last time it was overhauled?
- About a month ago.
Captain?
- Yes, Holman?
- Got a burnt bearing, sir.
It could tear up the crankshaft.
I'd like to shut down and repair it.
Holman, as long as we move and smoke boils out of our stack, we'll make the impression
I want to make on the Chinese.
Yes, sir. It's still gonna give us trouble, sir.
It never has.
Yes, sir.
Here's a message, sir.
- Full speed ahead.
- Full speed ahead.
Full speed ahead.
Tell the Captain she won't take no more turns.
Oil the cups! Oil the cups! Oil the cups!
Oil the cup. Oil. More oil.
- Holman, why aren't we up to full speed?
- She won't take no more turns, sir.
We're under orders to reach Changsha on the double.
She ain't gonna make it.
We've never had to stop before.
Well, I'm just telling you.
That's right.
Tell the Captain we must stop and secure.
As soon as we get the LP at the top, we'll lock in the jacking gear. That'll hold it.
- A lot of slack in that damn thing, Jake.
- There sure as hell is.
OK. Lock it in.
Two men. You and you.
Jacking gear in.
Into the pit. I order you.
- I won't go.
- You are boss. You do it.
- You want to be fired?
- Do it yourself.
Gimme the wrench.
My takee wrench. My takee wrench.
OK, Chien.
Hammer.
- Watch it!
- The damn jacking gear gave way!
- Get Jennings down here!
- Aye aye, sir!
Floor plate down. If you try and pull him out through there you'll tear him to pieces.
Frenchy...
- The drain valves open?
- Yeah.
And Frenchy?
Don't let no steam build up, huh?
All right. Come on. Out, out.
Come on.
Easy, easy.
Hey, Jennings, grab his hands.
Easy. Easy now.
OK.
- Slow engine.
- Slow engine.
Stand by all lines.
Get cleaned up.
The Captain's waiting for you.
A man has been killed on this ship for the first time. I want to know why.
- A key in the jacking gearjarred out, sir.
- Why?
- Vibration.
- And why the vibration?
Because of the bearing knock, sir. I guess one key has been missin' for a long time.
And the other one's just being held in by rust.
Can you fix any personal responsibility for this?
- For the jacking gear, sir?
- For the accident, Holman.
Without the knock in the LP, there'd be no vibration.
Chien handled the overhaul.
He should have fixed it, sir.
Are you saying that Chien killed himself?
I'll remind you he worked under supervision.
Can't supervise an overhaul and stand deck watches at the same time, sir.
Black gang should stand their watches in the engine room, sir.
Lop-eye Shing says that you killed Chien.
You threw the engine in some mysterious way.
Now, that may be superstition,
Holman, but it's very real to them.
Your resentment of Chien was well known.
The system you got on this ship is what killed him, sir.
You will immediately train a new coolie to take Chien's place. Give it your full time.
- They ain't got the brains.
- They operate efficiently enough.
It's monkey see, monkey do. They don't know what happens with the engine.
- It's not necessary they should.
- Let me run the engine room like I should.
- I can give you 12 knots, no breakdowns...
- Holman.
I'm the one here who decides what jobs'll be done by whom.
The crew of this ship is designed just like the machinery that powers the ship.
Captains before me designed the San Pablo for a special job in the backwaters of China.
But men will not hold together like brass and steel.
We have to refit ourselves into the design every day.
That's the purpose of all we do in San Pablo.
As part of that design, you cannot do what you prefer to do, however well you do it.
You will train a new coolie and then return to your military duties.
That's all, Holman.
- Hey, come on. Over here.
- Hey, Red Dog! Bring our whiskey back!
- You no wantee whiskey?
- Oh, no, honey.
Not on an empty stomach, I'll tell you.
Hey, Jake.
Jake!
- How'd you make out with the Captain?
- One piece whiskey.
- We ain't waltzin' no more.
- What happened?
Collins says that us Sand Pebbles is like machinery, only different.
Huh?
We gotta keep changing, cos we ain't made out of brass. Think that one over.
Didn't he say nothing about Chien?
Yeah. I gotta train a new coolie.
- What?
- Yeah, one of them slopeheads.
I can't do it, Frenchy.
They think that engine's got ghosts in it.
- Sailor man?
- I'm broke.
Hey! Mama Chunk.
- Where's the new stuff?
- You all the time same Sand Pebble sailor.
What's the matter? No likee all the same girl?
What's the matter with her?

Brand new. She just now makee pretty.
I suppose bye-bye she come see you?
- Well, I...

Your eyes are bigger than your...
Hey. Oh, OK.
Right over here, lovey duck. Best table in the house. Right here. Sit over here.
Clear out, you slobs. Back to your pigs.
My name is Ski.
Ski. Savvy?
What name you?
My name is Maily.
Say that again.
- My name is Maily.
- Did you hear that? A Vassar girl.
- Well, hello, Maily.
- Ski, I am your buddy.
- Shove off, Restorff.
- Hey, Ski. Pal? Come on.
I'm sure you have your own joy junks to go to.
Come on, why don't you vamoose?
Come on, you guys, beat it.
Maily, what'll you have to drink?
I should warn you,
I get a commission on what I drink.
All I drink is cold tea, but you'll have to pay for whiskey.
Oh. I see. Yeah, sure.
Boy! Catch two piece whiskey.
Relax. Relax, Maily.
- I keep books for Mr Shu.
- Oh.
And act as hostess.
I'm very pleased to meet all of you.
Yeah.
Where'd you learn to talk English like that?
My secret.
Uh-huh.
- Where do you come from?
- New Jersey.
- Oh, yes. Trenton.
- Yeah, Trenton's in New Jersey.
- Where Washington crossed the Delaware.
- Yeah. That was a little before my time.
As hostess, I'm supposed to divide my time among all the tables.
It's been pleasant meeting all of you, but I must go now.
Oh, no, no. Not till we take a little trip across the Delaware.
I don't go upstairs. I'm only a hostess.
- Ski, she don't love you.
- Hey, Ski, go and get some air.
Mr Ski, please. Please don't!
- Ski, let her alone!
- You go to hell.
Please.
Hold it, Frenchy. In case you didn't know, this girl's got duties, just like sailors.
- Oh, please.
- Oh, let her go.
Now, Frenchy, stand fast! That's an order.
You know better than to mess around with another man's girl till he's through with her.
What's the matter? Wait. What's the matter?
You want to go topside her? Pay money.
- Money!
- Money, money. OK.
- Come on. Topside.
- Wait.
This girl first time.
Must pay 200 dollar.

- 200 dollar!
- You think I'm an admiral?
- That be first-time price.
- Who say so?
- Victor Shu.
- Nobody's ever gonna have that much.
- I'll be damned.
- I'm still drinkin' with her.
- No. She go other table now.
You can't change the house rules just like that.
- As long as I pay for her drinks, I keep her.
- What's the matter? You crazy?
Come on, on the side.
Come on. Come on. All right, break it up.
All right, break it up. Go back to your pigs.
Wait. Wait. You like talk to pretty girl?
Yeah, sure, Mama.

- Frenchy.
- And yours?
- Jake Holman.
- Mine is Maily.
- How do you do?
Ooh!
- Thank you very much for helping me.
- Oh, it was nothing.
- Where are you from, Mr Holman?
- Utah.
- Oh, Salt Lake City.
- Uh-huh.
- I'm from Philadelphia.
- Yes, Liberty Bell.
- Uh-huh.
- Is Utah nice?
Oh, for some people.
Well, I guess I'd better get back to ship.
- Huh?
- Yeah. Thanks, buddy.
- So long.
- There's a guy who knows when to leave.
Where'd you learn to speak English this good, Maily?
My secret.
Oh.
Why $200?
Is there something special about $200?
Yeah, I know. Your secret, huh?
Well, what happens when Shu gets his $200?
I go to Hankow, to Shanghai.
I am free!
I wish I had $200.
Oh, I mean... I mean, just to give you.
You would do that?
Yeah, sure.
Look... I'll get it.
Time's up. Next table.
You gotta work fast here, boy.
My name's Farren. I don't come from nowhere and I don't wanna talk geography.
- Anybody wanna shoot a little crap?
- You won't get 200 bucks from me, lover boy.
Next week, Frenchy. Next week.
Hey. Come here.
You, uh... you likee be boss?
All same, like Chien?
Like same who?
Chien. Number one engine coolie.
Him all die.
Yeah, him all die. And that's too bad.
But I wantee new boss, savvy?
Teachee all pidgin.
Oh. Engine side not proper?
No, no, the engine's OK.
I'll teach you how to run it right. Come here.
Now, the valve.
Huh?
Belong same.
- Valve.
- Wowel.
Valve.
Wowel.
- Wowel.
- Yeah?
OK. Wowel.
Now, main steam stop valve.
May stim stop wowel.
Where?
You find.
No, no.
No, not proper wowel.
May stim stop wowel.
- May stim stop wowel?
- Yeah.
- May stim stop wowel?
- Main steam stop valve.
But I don't know.
You, me, can do.
Jake.
OK.
OK. If you go that way, then we're going reverse. OK?
Huh?
The generator. Makes juice for the lights.
See?
OK.
This is the boiler.
Inside belongs live steam. Savvy?
Strong steam.
- Stim.
- Steam.
Stim.
Live stim goes through this pipe.
Live stim goes into the feed pump.
Live stim! Make pump go vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom...
Live stim, huh?
Live stim... Live stim... Live stim.
Exhaust stim.
Condenser. Makee steam all dead.
You know, sleepy stim.
Live stim, dead stim.
Before, live stim.
Now water. Water belong dead stim.
All same dead stim.
Stim dead. Stim dead!
That's right. That's it.
Now you got it! That's right!
That's the way it works!
And that's the throttle.
I'll teach you about that throttle one day.
Go ahead. Grab ahold of it.
Boo!
Nah. There ain't no ghosts in that engine.
Hey!
- Who's your new throttle man, Homang?
- Out.
Ask the new throttle man if you can have some coffee. Maybe he'll let you use his cup.
Yeah. Why, you slant-eyed bastard...
Holman, you'd better watch out.
Lettin' that slopehead drink coffee down here, touch the throttle...
You watch out, Holman.
Slopehead!
Pick up your coffee cup.
Looks like you ain't runnin' this ship after all, Lop-eye.
Sir, is it wise overruling Lop-eye about the coolie?
That's not what I've done.
The crew wants Po-han off the ship.
They believe Stawski about what happened in the engine room.
- You believe Holman, sir?
- Not necessarily, but he makes more sense.
But Lop-eye fired Po-han. He'll lose face if Holman makes the crew change their mind.
Unlikely as that is, it might serve a purpose.
Lop-eye has a tendency to forget his place from time to time.
That's right. That's what happened, Holman.
The slopehead hit me and you jumped me before I had a chance to kill him.
- Right, Perna?
- Just like that.
You're lucky I busted it up when I did.
If he'd have hit ya, he woulda killed ya.
The slopehead woulda killed me?
You never... You ever see a slopehead fight?
- You guys saw a slopehead fight.
- Yeah.
Holman, you're crazy.
He woulda killed the Chink.
- He woulda put out your lights.
- Who says so?
- I got 50 bucks that says so.
- I'll take it.
- You got any more?
- I'll take some of that.
Now, wait a minute. Hold it, hold it.
Hold it! Hold it! Just one minute! Hold it!
Who's gonna do the fightin' here? Now,
I don't go for it unless you bet me $100.
- You holdin' $100?
- Yeah, I'm holdin' $100.
And I need $200 to buy myself a very special present.
$100 says he'll take you.
Oh, Maily! Maily, here I come!
Hey, hold it.
Beside the money, if Po-han wins, he stays aboard. That's my deal.
- Sure.
- Well, he's not gonna win anyway.
- Bets right here.
- You said $50, huh?
Hey. You got any more, Homang?
- Yeah, I got an extra $50.
- Holman?
- I'll bet you $10 the slopehead don't fight.
- He'll fight.
Put me down for $10.
Hey, Chief. When are we gonna start?
- Frenchy, you mustn't worry.
- How the hell can you say...
- Excuse me.
- If Ski gets me, then he's supposed to.
- That big ape.
- It will only mean that I'm being punished.
- For what?
- My secret.
Now look. You quit that "my secret" stuff.
- Who'd wanna punish you?
- God.
- Who?
- God!
What'd you do to him?
I...
I stole some money from American missionaries.
They found me as a baby and brought me up.
Why did you steal it?
To get away.
They wanted me to be a missionary too.
I meant to go to Shanghai and earn enough money to send it back to them.
But I couldn't get there. So I came to
Changsha instead and Mr Shu advanced it.
And now he must be paid. And so must God.
You're bughouse, Maily.
What kind of religion do they teach you?
- Don't you worry about it.
- The Chinaman can't fight.
Get me some beer.
Yeah, he's big. But he's blubber.
How can you fight and drink beer?
Ah!
Po-han. Get him in the throat, in the kidneys, in the gut. Hurt him.
Too much cold this side. Suppose cold this side, any man no can fight.
Oh, you plenty time fight Chinese man.
How you no fashion fight Stawski?
- Ski no same.
- Come on, boy!
Listen to me. He's gonna try to hurt you.
Forget what colour he is.
You want you come back ship, you fight.
Fight!
- Give me a bell.
- Let's get out here.
- Come on out here.
- Let's go.
- How you doin'?
- Come on! Come on, get out here.
- Ski, you look great.
- Come on, come on, come on.
Now look. No kickee, no scratchee.
None of that stuff, you savvy?
- Me savvy.
- Me no savvy.
You!
Go on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Give me a bell.
OK. Let's go.
Get him, get him. Come on!
Boo!
Come on. Hit me. Come on, come on. Hit me.
What's the matter?
Your man all same not fight? Huh?
Give you even money Ski don't knock him out in the first round.
Drop anchor, will you?
- Hit him!
- Fight!
What do I do now, Ma?
Come on. Fight. Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Hit him.
All right. Break, break.
- Hi, Haythorn, how are ya?
- Hit him! Hit him.
- Get up, Ski. Get up!
- Get up there.
Get up, Ski!
Hit him!
- One...
- He's bleeding. The guy is bleeding, Ski.
Finish him off.
- One. Two.
- You got him, Ski.
- Three.
- He wants his mother, Ski.
- Four. Five.
- He wants his mommy.
- Nice going!
- You've got him goin', boy.
Thanks for the fifty, Homang!
Now listen. He's getting tired.
You thinkee he tired hit me?
I'm tellin' you, he's runnin' out of steam.
Now, hit him, Po-han. Hit him in the guts.
Hit him. Hit him!
Pack your bags for that trip across the Delaware, baby!
Hit him.
Hammer! Hammer!
Get him, Ski!
Hit him! Hit him!
Come on, Ski, belt him!
Open his face!
Tear his head off!
Come on, Ski, get him!
Hammer!
Hammer!
This is what happens when you train on beer.
Finish him this time. You'll need your strength for the main event.
Oh, yeah! Whee!
Hammer! He's ready to go down.
Hammer! Hammer!
Yeah, hammer, hammer.
Hit him in the gut. In the gut!
Kiss your money goodbye, Holman.
- Jake, if we lose fight, you lose money?
- Three. Four.
- Five. Six. Seven.
- Yeah. I lose money. But you lose ship.
Eight.
Come on. Fight.
One. Two.
Three. Four.
One. Two.
Three. Four.
Put him down. Put him down!
- Get him, Ski. Get him!
- Hammer!
Hit the bum!
Hammer! Hammer!
- Ski!
- One. Two.
- Three.
- Four!
- Get up, you slob.
- Get up, Ski.
One. Two. Three.
Four. Five.
Emergency recall!
Everybody back to the ship on the double.
Finish the count! Six!
- Let him alone.
- Eight!
- Nine! Ten!
- Yahoo!
Maily! I told you he'd do it!
I told you! What'd I tell you?
Me go back to ship?
You're damned right you do!
- Come on! Let's go!
- What the hell's goin' on up there, Waldron?
- Who's blowin' that whistle?
- On the double!
On the double! On the double, there!
- Keep moving.
- Let's go!
- What's goin' on?
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Come on, Chief, get 'em aboard. Look alive!
- Come on! Come on!
Get steam up. Stand by to cast off lines and drift if we don't get steam up fast enough.
We'll anchor in the channel.
Sober the men up.
- We may have to repel boarders.
- Aye aye. Chief, prepare to get underway.
Now hear this.
Make all preparations for getting underway.
Holman!
Get steam up to the engine on the double.
- Come on, Red Dog.
- Just a moment.
Up on the bridge. Come on.
- Steam coming up on number two.
- I'll get the steam pump.
Where are you goin'? You're boss now.
- Look sharp on those lines!
- All hands are on board, Captain.
Very well.
- Cast off all lines!
- Cast off all lines!
Get 'em in. Come on.
Take in gangway, on the double.
Last night, at Wanxian up the gorges of the Yangtze, two British warships fought with the local warlord.
200 Chinese were killed, and 150 British.
The Bolsheviks are now saying that
2,000 innocent Chinese were slaughtered.
- We're up against a new strategy of lies.
- I see, sir.
The students of China support a new leader,
Chiang Kai-shek of the Nationalist Party.
He's leading an army north to wipe out the warlords.
- What are we to do, sir?
- We have new orders, Mr Bordelles.
- Not to fire back.
- Sir?
- Not to fire back.
- I don't understand, sir.
Apparently, we're being blamed for everything. "The foreign devils".
Oh, it's an old trick, to unify people by getting them to hate something or someone.
Well, we're it.
They all want to get rid of us.
Chiang Kai-shek peacefully, the Communists in the movement by force.
And we're supposed to grin and bear it.
Because if we fire back, we give them new propaganda to use against us, and play into the hands of Communists, who want us to start a real war so that Russia can come to China's rescue and in that way take her over.
It is an accident of history that we in the
San Pablo are the first American armed unit to come face to face with this new thing.
How we face it can be our great honour, or our dishonour.
I intend that it shall be our honour.
Our government has decided for now not to treat fighting between
Chiang Kai-shek and the other warlords as just another warlord squabble.
We will treat it as an authentic civil war, in which we must remain very carefully neutral.
The United States Government has ordered the evacuation of central China.
We shall be making one last trip to Baoshan to rescue the missionaries at China Light.
Make all preparations for getting underway.
- Stop engine.
- Stop engine.
Those are the China Light people, but I don't see Jameson. Where is Jameson?
He wouldn't come.
- Go to China Light and get him.
- Aye aye, sir.
Shove off at once. Damned nonsense.
Left, left, left, right.
Left, left and right turn.
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, right and left turn.
Left, left, left, right, left, left, left, right, left, left and halt.
Left face.
Mr Jameson is in my custody.
- Yes?
- Mr Jameson, please.
Come in. He's down the hall.
Hi.
She's a schoolteacher. I met her on a steamer comin' up from Shanghai.
- Yeah?
- She's a lady.
They'd do great on the San Pablo, huh?
Collins'd have 'em standin' like that all day.
- Hello.
- Hi. Thanks.
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm Shirley Eckert.
- Oh. Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?
Those kids stand like that much longer, they're gonna melt.
What's all the machinery you got over there?
A lot of things we don't understand.
I thought about you the minute I saw it.
- How do you like your gunboat?
- It's OK.
- Do you like your teaching here?
- Oh, yes. Very much.
That's to make beet sugar, and this is for electric light.
Hey, you oughta be runnin' 'em.
- Cho-jen!
- How come you ain't runnin' 'em?
We don't know how. Some wealthy man from Philadelphia sent them out.
Cho-jen.
Cho-jen's the leader of the students in this district.
I want you to meet him. He's very bright.
Cho-jen, this is Mr Holman. He's an engineer.
- Hiya.
- Hello.
Where's your direction manuals?
Machinery like this usually has 'em.
Oh, well, I think Mr Jameson has them.
Attention! Attention! Face front!
That Cho-jen, he a Bolshevik?
Oh, no. Chiang Kai-shek is his god.
For all of them he's the hope.
How come he tied a can to the Reverend?
Mr Jameson stood trial in a Chinese court here. He's under sentence of death.
Opium was growing on a remote piece of mission property.
He didn't know, but technically he's responsible.
Why go to a Chinese court?
He coulda ducked that.
He didn't want to.
He's in Cho-jen's custody now.
We're going to Changsha to appeal the sentence. We're sure it'll be changed.
Then we can return to our work here.
Changsha? That's where we're goin'.
We heard you were taking the missionaries all the way down to Hankow.
Changsha.
Shirley!
The San Pablo is going to Changsha.
It'll be quicker than going overland.
Cho-jen has agreed.
We'll leave when you are ready.
I'll go pack.
Now, don't take too much.
I'm sure we'll be returning.
Forward march!
Mr Bordelles, steam is up. We'll get underway when the motor pan's secured.
Aye aye, sir.
- Repel boarders port side, on the double.
- Aye aye, sir. Repel boarders port side!
Repel boarders port side!
Repel boarders port side!
Don't shoot unless attacked. Wait the word.
Wait the word!
It's the bilge coolie, Captain.
- Hold fire!
- Hold fire!
- What was he doing ashore?
- I send.
- Cho-jen?
- They are not ours.
Let him go! He is our countryman!
- What's he saying?
- "Watch what we do to the running dog."
- Who is it, sir?
- It's Po-han.
Offer ransom.
Speak I pay money, $100.
- No, sir.
- Speak!
Release him. The American sailors will pay $100 if you let him go.
We dare you to shoot.
- What?
- They dare ship to shoot.
Yes. They'd like another incident.
They'd like a war. Tell them $200.
He will pay you $200.
He will pay $200.
Four hundred!
- You dirty bastards!
- Crosley, stand clear of that gun!
- They're killing that coolie!
- Stand clear! Bronson, take over.
Hold station, Holman.
Five hundred!
$500, the Captain will pay you.
Let him go! Let him go!
Steady. Steady. Hold station, Holman.
Offer $1,000!
- Get back to your station.
- Do something!
- Get below, or I'll have you shot for mutiny.
- Well, shoot somethin'!
Someone save me! Please shoot me!
Po-han say, somebody shoot him.
Holman! Holman!
Holman!
- Jake.
- Get out.
That man this afternoon, who was he?
He was a bilge coolie I trained.
So you became a teacher too, hm?
Yeah.
That's good.
If you had killed a Chinese, there'd have been a massacre.
We'd have had to open fire, and it might have been the war the Bolsheviks want. You see?
As it is, in killing the coolie...
Although I can understand your feelings,
I can't condone what you did.
However, I choose to ignore it officially, on condition you request a transfer.
You're opposed to the whole spirit aboard the
San Pablo, Holman. You've disrupted morale.
You've been involved in the only two deaths this ship has ever had, and the men consider you a Jonah.
If you won't request a transfer to keep your record clean, then I'll request it.
I'll request it, sir.
You want me to keep running the engine?
Yes. It'll be some time before a replacement can get here.
That'll be all.
- Engine ahead one third.
- Engine ahead one third.
- Prepare to drop anchor out here.
- Aye aye, sir. Stand by the anchor.
- Stop engine.
- Stop engine.
Let go the anchor.
Did you ever find out what happened to them engine manuals?
Mr Jameson says he has them.
- Hit them with the hose if they get too close.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Get a fire hose up here.
- Right.
The Boatmen's Union has declared a strike on your ship.
When the missionaries go ashore, send an armed escort.
- With what orders, sir?
- The same orders the ship has.
Fire only to save American lives, and then only when everything else fails.
We demand that you permit us to take off the citizens of Republic of China who you are holding against their will.
You can go to hell. Hit 'em with the hose.
Aye aye, sir. Give us the water.
Come ahead! Come ahead!
Keep it smart!
Come ahead! Come ahead!
Left, right, left. Left.
Left. Left, right, left.
Detail, halt.
Mr Jameson.
Miss Eckert, how nice to see you again.
Left face!
Mr Bordelles, this is Major Chin of the Nationalist Chinese Army.
- What is your mission here, Mr Bordelles?
- I ask you that, Major Chin.
- This compound is American property.
- It is Chinese soil.
I have authority under Chinese law to commandeer it for battalion headquarters.
You have no right to be here under arms.
I will have you escorted back to your ship.
Let me warn you, Major Chin.
If your superior officers are not prepared to go to war against the United States, they will undoubtedly disavow your actions and make amends.
Do you understand my meaning?
It has happened before.
All too often before.
But we've had enough of that now.
I will quote your own history to you,
Mr Bordelles.
"If you mean to have a war, let it begin here."
Gentlemen, please. Mr Bordelles, we're perfectly safe here with Major Chin.
You may have your men sling arms, or you may have them lay down their arms.
You may go under escort or under full arrest.
That is all the choice I will give you.
And you must make it now.
Present arms.
Sling... arms.
Turn right!
Right face.
Right and left about... turn.
Detail, forward march!
- Don't wash it. Burn it! Burn it.
- Throw that out.
Nobody could wash it clean enough for me to wear.
- What the hell happened?
- Shut up!
Wash this, will you?
- Will there still be liberty, sir?
- I have no instructions to the contrary.
- They'll tear the town apart.
- Restrict it to that place they usually go.
Aye, sir.
- Where you been?
- Nobody'd rent me a room for Maily.
- You get one?
- Finally. It cost me an arm and a leg though.
- What's going on?
- She's been with them since I got here.
- They've got her drinking.
- Did you tell her?
I ain't had a chance.
Give me the dough, Frenchy.
I'll talk to Shu, have him get her away from them, huh?
Yeah.
Shu?
I got the $200 for Maily.
Now, let's do it quiet.
Just pry her loose from those guys in a few minutes and bring her outside.
I got the $200.
- Outside.
- I say $210.
Well, how about it, sailor?
You said the price was $200, Shu.
- And I said $210.
- Butt out of this, mister.
All right, break it up, you guys.
You've got no authority over me, sailor.
He's right.
Match it.
- I'll pay $210.
- Auction! Auction! How about it, Mr Shu?
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
We haven't had an auction here yet.
So let's do it.
Why not?
- Wait a minute. Keep clear.
- Put her up on the block.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Now, just look at this merchandise.
Now, what am I bid for this clean, delicious piece of girl-flesh here?
- Come on, what am I bid?
And 40.
Boys, boys. That won't even buy one leg.
Brand-fresh new goods, untouched by human hands.
- Let's bid it up here, come on.
- More! More!
Boys! Who'll say $300 and we see it all?
All right, let's take a look at her.
- $300 I got...
- $300. Now let her go, damn you!
- She ain't yours yet, buddy.
- $350, I...
Strip her. Strip her!
Strip her! Strip her! Strip her! Strip her!
$350! I said $350! Now that's it!
- Bid $400 and we strip her.
- OK. $400.
Jake, come on!
Watch the steps. They're slippery.
It's down this way.
- Anybody after us?
- Nah.
- Oh, let me go back.
- After all that?
- Please!
- No. No.
Here. Here.
- Boy. If ever I get my hands on those guys...
- You've got enough troubles.
What happens now?
Well, I guess I'll go back tomorrow and pay Shu the $200.
That's all she owes him.
- OK.
- I'll see you.
No, hey, hey.
Hang on a minute. I'll go with you.
You all right?
I'm sorry as hell about...
You'll be OK here.
I'm gonna go tomorrow and pay Shu just what you owe him.
Then I'll get you on a train to Shanghai.
Look, if I can't get you on a train right away, you could stay here, huh?
Maybe I'll... I'll drop in.
I sure as hell apologise. I don't know what to say about those guys. They...
You all right?
Let me go away. Just let me go away.
No. I want you to go to Shanghai like you want, but not just away like that.
I'll do what you want. You've bought me.
No. I didn't buy you.
Oh, sure, I'm gonna pay some money, but I'm not buying you.
I don't want it to be...
Well, I don't want it to be like that between us.
I want it to be something else.
It's got to be something else.
You'll be all right.
Please. Please don't leave me.
- Jake?
- Yeah?
- I wanna marry her.
- Hey! Now, wait a minute...
I don't know what I've been doing.
Years with them dumb pigs...
They got a law.
You can't marry no Chinese girl.
- One of them missionaries might marry us.
- Well, they ain't gonna do it.
Why don't you just move in with her?
No. I don't want that.
Maybe we could get it done in Chinese?
I just know I wanna marry her.
Six dollars.
OK.
Thank you.
Sounds kinda nuts, but guys catch these birds so you'll buy one and set it free.
You know, just for the hell...
For the fun of it.
- Go ahead.
- It's a lovely idea.
Well, it's supposed to make you feel like when you help an old lady across the street.
Go, fella.
It does. It's ridiculous, but it makes you feel marvellous.
- What happens if you make it?
- You get a wish.
Oh.
Jake, you made it!
You got it! You get a wish.
What do you want?
- I don't know.
- Well, there must be something.
Yeah, well. I used to want... want an engine.
Isn't the engine still important?
Well, not like it used to be.
- Why don't you take my wish?
- OK.
Oh, hey. Mr Jameson said
I could lend these to you.
These are the booklets for the machinery.
- OK. I'll look 'em over.
- All right.
- Well, go ahead. Take your wish.
- OK.
- Jake?
- Huh?
- Don't you wanna know?
- Know what?
Don't you wanna know what I wish for?
OK.
Well, I wished that someday you'd feel like telling me more about yourself.
Sometime.
When you feel like it.
OK.
So? Then what happened?
- You just keep pullin', don't you?
- You can't just stop in the middle.
Well, why not?
Because it's about you. I'd like to know.
OK. I graduated at the head of my class.
Jake!
Um... I got kicked outta school.
- Aw...
- Aw?
No, I mean it. What happened?
Well, me and this guy got in it on a class picnic.
He brought a couple of bottles of booze and he was chargin' double for drinks.
And I never liked him anyhow, so I hung one on him.
Thing was, though, I was gonna get my diploma in a couple of months.
So I went to see the principal.
He was one of them soft, smiley kind of guys.
He said "If you'll sign this paper saying you brought the booze, that'll be that."
So, like a bonehead, I signed it. Then he looks at the paper and he kinda smiles.
He says "Well, I'll have to think about it."
So I guess I started swingin'.
I forgot he was wearing glasses, and I put out his eye.
So anyhow, the judge says "You got three choices: Army, navy, reform school."
Well, why did you pick the navy?
Well, ain't much water in Utah.
Jake. Wasn't there anybody to stick up for you with the judge?
My mother. She didn't count for very much around there, though.
But a good dame.
We're mixing our lives together, Maily.
We'll never be able to unmix 'em again.
And we'll never want to.
I take you for what you are, and all that you are, and mix you with all of me.
And I don't hold back nothing.
When you're cold and hungry and afraid, so am I.
I'm gonna stay with you all I can, and take the best care of you I can.
And love you... till I die.
Now you say it.
I will always love you, and honour and serve you, and stay as near to you as I can, and do everything for you, and live for you.
I won't have any life except our life together.
I will just love you, Frenchy, all of me, loving you for ever.
Now we're married.
Want to put a hand on ours for luck?
I hope you have luck, and I hope it goes smooth and easy for you.
Thanks for comin'.
They seem very much in love.
- Frenchy is.
- Not Maily?
Yeah, but she knows.
She's not foolin' herself.
- About what?
- Well, for one thing, she's Chinese.
And for another, one day he's gonna get shipped out.
- She could follow him.
- Where?
What they got right now ain't no good.
Somethin' called a "block committee" is trying to kick 'em out of their rooms.
Where are they gonna go?
Just runnin' from hole to hole.
Still, I envy them.
Jake...
It ain't gonna work, Shirley.
Why?
Cos you're goin' back to China Light pretty soon, and I'm goin' back to the fleet.
Jake? Come back to China Light with us now.
You know how hard they look for deserters, Shirley?
And what happens to 'em when they catch 'em?
Well... Well, I just thought...
Knowing how you feel about the military, and that you taught Po-han...
That ain't what we're talkin' about.
Oh, it's good up there, Jake.
It can be a good life.
The court's agreed to let Mr Jameson go back.
You could come as a kind of engineering missionary.
I shouldn't have suggested it.
I'm sorry.
I told you not to talk to sailors, didn't I?
Hey, look. I wonder what's the matter.
They're jumpin' all over.
Hey, it's our coolies. They're jumpin' ship!
Bend off.
- Hey, what the hell happened?
- Shing put opium on board, said it was ours.
- Ski, the bonehead, dumped it in the furnace.
- The Captain told me to get rid of it.
- We can't run this ship without coolies.
- Well, we're gonna.
Shall we try to mask the smoke with rubber, Captain?
It's too late, Mr Bordelles. It's too late.
The San Pablo is now in a state of siege here, and will be all winter.
The water level in the channel is already too low for us to leave before spring.
There will be no liberty.
No contact with the shore except a guard mail trip to the consulate once a week.
Each of you will get a chance to make this trip once.
They have singled out
San Pablo for destruction, using their new weapons of boycott and propaganda.
They expect in the end to haul down the flag in shame and disgrace.
We will not let them do that.
When the time comes, we will defend our flag with our life's blood.
They will watch us every minute.
They will gloat over every rust streak down our sides, every sign of military slackness.
They expect to destroy us.
But it will only make us stronger.
That's all. Carry on.
All right, Chief. Carry on.
Ten hut! Dismissed.
The next incident, they could just as well turn on him and kill him.
Well, at least he's off our necks, sir.
Our primary mission is still to defend American lives.
Even if they are damned fools.
Pray for an early spring.
Or permission to open fire.
Frenchy, you mustn't come here any more.
- You must stay on the ship.
- No.
Sometimes, when I come here,
I think maybe you've gone...
They've chased you away someplace I can't find you.
- Maybe it would be better.
- No, sweetie, don't say that.
I can't help it.
I'm nothing.
I'm not Chinese, I'm not American.
And the child will be nothing.
He'll be ours.
Like you're mine. That's all we need.
Harris, clean up your stinkin' mess!
I'm not gonna do your work.
- I won't stand any more of your watches.
- Harris, lay below!
- Perna, you...
- I said lay below!
Harris!
- Cut it out! Cut it out, you guys!
- Let him go! Let him go!
- Get the deck aides to help you.
- What's the matter with you guys?
- Isn't there enough trouble with slopeheads?
- Get him down below where he belongs!
- I'm an electrician. He belongs below.
- Knock it off!
And the rest of you!
What are you standin' around for?
I want you to start wearing side arms. Franks, too.
When the water in the channel rises and we can get to Shanghai, everything will be all right.
Till then, the men are not responsible.
They have to be protected.
- So stay clear of them.
- Aye aye, sir.
There's never been a mutiny aboard a United States ship of war.
I'm not gonna give them the slightest chance on this one.
I understand, sir.
I told him to go back to the ship to see a doctor.
But he was afraid they would lock him up.
How long has he been dead?
Last night.
You can't stay here.
I'll be all right.
You go back to your ship.
I'm all through with that.
Come up to China Light with me.
I can't.
Listen. Listen.
Frenchy'd want you to.
It's gonna be all different up there.
Nobody's gonna ask you whether you're Chinese or American, where's your father, or anything.
It's just gonna be everybody, all together.
And you got your kid to think about.
Shirley says they grow vegetables, and they got a milk goat.
You can't stay here. Get out.
Him, too. Wake him up, white man's slut!
- The white pig is dead.
- Throw her out.
Stop! What are you doing here?
Come with us. Come!
Don't come back to that part of the city again.
What the hell happened?
Don't say nothin' about this on the ship, will you?
All right.
Captain! Mr Bordelles!
Captain?
- Repel boarders.
- Repel boarders! All hands to stations.
Repel boarders! Repel boarders!
Hey! What the?
- Get Holman up here on the double.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Captain wants to see you.
- Now what's goin' on?
I don't know.
- What's this all about?
- I don't know, sir.
You were ashore yesterday. What happened?
Tell me. That's an order.
- I don't know anything about no murder.
- He is a murderer!
He killed a Chinese woman who was carrying his child!
What is it? What's he talking about?
Frenchy's wife. Maily.
I think they killed her.
What happened?
Frenchy's dead. He got sick and he couldn't make it back.
While I was there they busted in and...
I didn't think they'd do that.
They say you killed her. That's all that's important. How do they know your name?
They must have found my hat.
Within two days this'll be an international incident.
"American Gunboat Sailor
Kills Chinese Woman."
- Is the channel deep enough yet?
- Well, I think we could make it, sir.
We may have to fight our way out of here.
Not for you personally, Holman.
You only matter now as a symbol of your country.
That's all.
- Secure from repel boarders.
- Aye aye, sir.
We wanna talk to you. Word is, they ain't gonna let us out till they get you.
As long as you're aboard, they ain't gonna give up.
They got guns between here and Hankow.
Blow us right out of the water.
You oughta turn yourself in.
Tell the Captain you'll go ashore and stand trial so we can get outta here.
- I didn't kill Maily.
- Then you got no problems.
They'll let you go.
You give yourself up, Holman. You've been a Jonah since the day you come aboard.
Captain!
Looks like nationalist soldiers this time.
Repel boarders.
Get Holman up to the flying bridge.
Underjust and equal law of nations, we demand you give up murderer Holman to people's justice.
Under the just law of nations, you people are pirates. I will not parley with you.
We will!
Come and get him!
- Come and get him!
- Silence on the main deck!
Homang, come down!
Homang! Come down!
- Homang, come down. Homang, come down.
- Homang, come down.
Homang, come down.
Homang, come down.
Homang, come down. Homang, come down.
Homang, come down. Homang, come down.
Holman, if you make any effort to give yourself up...
You in the sampan there, shove off!
Shove off, or I'll fire into you.
Crosley, fire a burst into the water.
Crosley, damn you, fire a burst!
The gun is jammed, sir.
- Bronson, fire a burst!
- The gun's jammed, sir.
Homang, come down!
Homang, come down! Homang, come down!
Homang, come down! Homang, come down!
Homang...
Mr Bordelles, make all preparations for getting underway.
- Take her out of rifle range and anchor her.
- Aye aye, sir.
Captain...
Make preparations for getting underway.
Aye aye, sir.
Here. Wear this.
Come back up as soon as we secure.
Make all preparations for getting underway.
Captain?
Sir, there's an urgent message.
Nationalist troops have Nanking.
They're killing American treaty people.
British and American ships have shelled the city. Marines are landing in Shanghai.
Sir? Treaty people are being directed to flee to the coast for their lives.
Plan Red will be put into effect upon confirmation from Washington.
Mr Bordelles, get Franks.
Come into my cabin, all of you.
What happened this morning has not gone down on paper yet.
It is not history unless it goes down on paper.
What is going down on paper for the end of San Pablo is quite different.
Our radio communications are out of order.
They're out of order.
We are therefore on our own.
Not hampered by orders from above.
At dawn we will get underway.
We will proceed into the lake.
Then, instead of turning downriver to Shanghai, we will cross the lake, and turn up the Chien River to China Light.
Our objective will be to rescue the missionaries at China Light.
After the slaughter at Nanking they will be desperate for rescue.
We will make one last, savage thrust deep into China, and if the San Pablo dies, she dies clean.
It is my responsibility to the ship.
And to the men.
They've been put through intolerable strain.
They rate this... last chance.
Reports indicate the Chien river is blocked by a boom of junks linked with bamboo cable and defended by militia.
We will break that boom and we will move on to rescue the people at China Light.
All right. There's the boom.
About a dozen junks, 50 to 60 feet apart, a cable from bow to bow.
- Half speed.
- Half speed!
It looks like the sampans are bringing more men from shore.
- Drop armour. Call general quarters.
- All hands, general quarters.
Man your battle stations.
Let's go! Let's go!
Look alive! Look alive!
Minimum crew in engine spaces.
All others topside.
Aye aye, sir.
Minimum crew in the engine spaces.
All others topside.
Comin' up. Stawski, take the throttle.
Perna and MacDonald, handle the boilers.
The rest of you, on deck.
Bronson.
Holman! Set up a BAR position forward.
You others, lend a hand.
- Aye aye, sir.
- I'll get it.
From the bulkhead over.
- Battle stations manned and ready.
- Very well. Run up the battle flag.
Aye aye, sir. Battle flag!
- Full speed!
- Full speed.
- Holman, you lower the jack staff.
- Let's go!
Here you go.
- Steer for the centre of the channel.
- Steering for the centre of the channel, sir.
Prepare to concentrate fire on the centre junk.
- Have Wellbeck take the con below.
- Chief, take the wheel.
I got it.
- They're within range, sir.
- They'll have to fire first.
Half speed.
Half speed, sir.
- Main battery, commence firing.
- Main battery, commence firing.
Ready.
Ready!
Ready.
Ready.
Sir.
- Commence firing.
- Commence firing.
- Commence firing! Commence firing!
- Commence firing! Commence firing!
Magazine.
- Here you go.
- Ready!
How about that? The mast!
Ready.
- Captain.
- Ready!
- Slow speed.
- Slow speed, sir.
- Main battery, cease firing.
- Cease fire.
Cease firing!
- Boarding party, take arms!
- Aye aye, sir.
Boarding party, take arms!
Boarding party, take arms!
Boarding party, take arms!
First wave, take boarding position.
- Take her now and lay her alongside.
- Aye aye, sir.
Fix bayonets!
Prepare to grapple!
Grapple!
Boarding party, away!
Why, you dirty...
Let's go.
Aboard, second wave!
Let's go!
Down!
Come on, Holman. Come on!
Captain!
Return to the ship! Come on, Bronson.
Lend a hand with the wounded.
Return to the ship!
They'll try to repair the boom.
We haven't the strength to break it again.
If I'm not back by daylight, consider our mission failed. Sail without me.
- Captain, I can't do that.
- That's all. That's an order.
Whom do I have for a landing party?
Well, all of them are badly cut up, sir, but it's the best we could do.
Farren will handle the boat, and Bronson and Crosley.
Holman will be the senior petty officer.
- Remember your orders.
- Aye aye, sir.
- The men performed brilliantly, Mr Bordelles.
- Yes, sir.
Uh, Captain?
Good luck, sir.
Lieutenant Collins, it would be much better for all of us if you go away at once.
- We have no intention of leaving.
- Your lives are in danger.
- You shouldn't have come here.
- Jameson, you're to come back with me.
You have five minutes to pack what you need.
Our militia of students went to fight you at the boom.
I was hoping to see them come back victorious instead of you.
- You've heard about Nanking?
- Yes.
But those events have no bearing here.
You alone endanger us.
I must ask you to leave now.
My duty is to protect you.
No longer. Shirley, will you please get that paper from my desk?
We've declared ourselves stateless persons.
We've sent our names to Geneva.
That's impossible.
Read this.
- Jake.
- I tried to get back sooner. I couldn't.
- You staying?
- Yes. What happened at the boom?
By that signed declaration we have renounced nationality itself.
Your uniform now gives you no authority over us and no responsibility for us.
- Romantic nonsense.
- We've convinced most people here that there is no connection between ourselves and the gunboats.
- Your presence only endangers us.
- We're at war, Jameson. They'll kill you.
They will not.
Perhaps once this might have protected you, but not now.
Now it is shooting and killing.
It's too late for such fine distinctions.
It will protect us.
This afternoon, my ship fought its way through down there at the boom.
People were killed on both sides. You will not make that a futile and meaningless battle.
We will not serve to give meaning to your heroics. Our lives have their own meaning.
- We have renounced nationality!
- You were sentenced to death!
I am free, under the protection of a student.
They will not care who protects you now.
Not after Nanking.
And it will not be a student militia who comes for you now, but regular troops.
Miss Eckert, they will strip you and rape you.
And this whole valley will be destroyed when our country comes to avenge your death.
Do you want that?
You don't know them.
Have you ever cared for
Chinese women raped and butchered by the warlord troops you favour with your treaties?
- In heaven's name, leave us alone!
- That's enough!
Holman, help them get their things together.
No, sir.
That's an order.
You better get back to the ship, Captain.
Cos they're stayin' here. And so am I.
Do you know what this is?
Desertion in the face of the enemy.
I ain't got no more enemies.
Shove off, Captain.
Jameson! Jameson, sir!
Jameson, sir, sir...
Jameson, sir...
Jameson, sir...
Cho-jen was killed at the boom.
Soldiers are coming to get you. You must go.
Shirley, he says Cho-jen is dead.
Oh, no.
No!
You killed him at the boom.
And now they're coming for me.
Because of you... and your blind pride.
Damn your flag!
Damn all flags!
It's too late in the world for flags!
Lights! Get the lights.
Wait. Wait!
Listen to me.
Wait. Listen...
No!
Is there another way out of here?
A hut by the back wall has a door that leads to the open fields.
Show us.
Cover us. Come on.
Ammo.
- Which way?
- The doorway over there.
Holman, take charge and get everybody back to the motor pan.
You're senior here.
I'll stay and make 'em think we're all still here. Give me the BAR.
When I think you've gotten clear, I'll follow.
You did well at the boom today.
All of you.
Wait till I open fire, then get 'em out of here.
All right, you cover the screen!
You other men take the walls!
What the hell are we waitin' for?
Fire at anything that moves!
Jake...
He's dead. Get her outta here.
- Let's all get goin'.
- Somebody's gotta slow 'em up.
They'd nail us before we got to the river. If they get her, you know what they'll do to her.
- Jake, for God's sake!
- Get goin'.
No! Jake!
Now go ahead. I'll be along.
Hold your fire, Bronson.
Don't shoot till you see something.
How we doin', Crosley?
Watch it, Crosley!
We're gonna get outta here,
Bronson! Watch the walls.
OK, everybody out!
Time to go, Holman. Right!
Right.
I was home.
What happened?
What the hell happened?
FOR LOVE AND GOLD
Come on, come on.
- Come here... l'll catch you.
- Mercy, mercy, no!
- You asshole, idiot.
- Grab him, make him in pieces.
Slaughter them, slaughter them all.
No, no, please.
No, no, no.
- Badsmell?
- Shut up.
- Let me go, let me go.
- Hold on.
That's it.
I'm leavin'.
Help...
Let me go, let me go.
Get down.
- Let's play roll.
- No.
- A kid?
- Go away.
Hey, you asshole, what are you doing?
- Come on, hurry up.
- Come on, come on.
They are coming!
Quick!
You asshole!
- Get out of here.
- Get lost, get lost.
No, no, I beg your kindness.
Mercy, mercy, no.
Run away!
This staff is mine.
Get out.
Give me that, it's mine.
Your dirty thief!
It's mine.
- Drop it.
- No.
Grab him, come on.
Let him go.
- Hey, you, trader!
- Hold on, old man.
- Abacuc.
- Somebody helps me, help.
I'm going to hide myself.
They are thieves.
They are going to take all!
I've got to hire myself.
- Open up, Abacuc.
- Open up!
- We got something to sell to you.
- Open up or else we'll burn you.
- Get it up.
- No, let's throw him into the river.
- Let's go.
- Hey, you, get it up.
- Where are you taking me to?
- Open up or we're gonna drown you.
Gush, this is damn heavy!
Open it, open it.
- Ah! He's finally decided!
- What's going on, what's this about?
- What do you want?
- I'll show what's good for you.
- What a staff, ah?
- Look at this sward, the steel's great.
- Let me get out of here first.
- Good stuff, the best.
Get out, come on.
Look at this armor, Abacuc.
The armor of a great warrior.
- First I take it, then I pay it.
- Look at this.
What a thing!
Everything's spoiled.
- It's the best! How come it's spoiled?
- Who's gonna buy this staff?
- It's a big deal.
- It's a bad deal.
See, I'm gonna tell you,
I'm short on money, so I pay a little.
The cheaper old man.
What's this?
- What's written there?
- You nuts, do you know who did you...
- Stole these weapons and clothes from?
- No.
- Arnolf Iron-Hand.
- Who is he?
Prince's Otoni Fighter vassal, a great Lord of Saxon... damn it, I wish I've never seen you before.
I've killed him.
- Have you?
- Yes, he's dead.
- Are you sure?
- Of course.
Well, so, we'll have a good deal,
I'm gonna read it to you, right?
Hold on...
We concede to the owner of this parchment the possession of the...
Aurocastro Fortress in Pulha, and the vineyards, the cattle, and... all the riches in there. The Feudal
Gentleman has to make a sacred vow... to rule the city through wisdom vanishing with the terrible... danger that comes from the seas, with the winds of springs... when... when... when... hold on.
But, what danger?
A piece is missing. But this can worth it about a hundred grand...
- How?
- Selling it.
- Selling it?
- For a Gentleman. He, with this... parchment, goes to the Fortress and will take it for real.
Let's go find a Lord, and let's not sell the parchment.
We're gonna take possession of the land.
He'll be the head and we, the soldiers.
Before he'll swear that he'll divide everything with us.
- That's it.
- Sure, that's it!
So, he needs to be a haughty Gentleman, good looking, but hungry for... goods and for lands, yes,
Gentleman out of money...
- And in rags like ourselves.
- Definitely.
- I know one like that.
- Really?
Let's go to Civita, there'll be a tournament for all the Knights there.
Wait a minute!
His tent.
Aquilante?
Aquilante, you asshole.
Come here, I'm gonna give you some sugar, come here.
There you are, your stupid horse.
Now, I'll catch you.
Damn it!
Come here, you damn thing!
Come, come here, sweety.
Come here, you stupid thing,
I'll give you a reward.
- Here's your bar of sugar.
- That's what you got?
Gentleman, we've a good bargain for you.
We, ah... Otoni, known as The
Fighter, for God's will...
Prince of the Holy Roman Empire,
Lord of Saxon...
Duke of Battenburg and of Poemwritten, concedes to the owner... of this parchment... the possession of this City and of the Fortress... of Aurocastro in Pulha, with the vineyards, the cattle... and all the riches in there. The Feudal
Gentleman has to make a sublime vow... to rule the city through wisdom and eliminating, etc... etc.
We received this parchment from a great and noble Gentleman... that gave it to us when he was dying.
Now, we offer you, brave and spotless Gentleman...
And broke.
...the luck of been the owner of a wealthy land, and of the Fortress of...
Aurocastro. In change, you'll make a sublime swear of dividing... all the riches and all the goods, with all of us.
- Do you know who I am?
- No!
I supposed you've heard the name
Spanker Le Fugitive.
I've never heard it before.
Spanker Le Fugitive.
The biggest captain of Tussia.
And I'm the one who at a stroke of axe have cut him in two.
My name, pay attention, my name is Brancaleone, da Norcia.
Enrich, the landlord of this land, offers to the winner of this... tournament the title of Captain of... the Weapons and offers his daughter
Lucrecia to marry with him, too.
Consider that Brancaleone da Norcia, has already on his hands the title... and the wealthy marriage.
So, get out of here, you insignificant.
You and your miserable feudal of Pulha.
The vineyards, cattle and the sea full of fishes to be divided in a half.
Besides, put this into your mind, old man. Brancaleone da Norcia... has never shared anything with anybody.
Go ahead, go ahead.
Come on, stupid thing.
Take part in this tournament the
Knights: Wizard Peacock... cadet of Gun, Herald of the
Deaf, Badcome Villain of...
Sulmona, Sir of Corkscrew,
Rich, commonly known as Less Hand...
Brancaleone da Norcia.
The first contest is with Bigshout, commonly known as Dirty-Hand... versus Brancaleone da Norcia.
Present yourselves with your helms and shield of combat.
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Go ahead.
- It's that way!
- Stop it. Stop it.
Come back, don't run away.
Gush! Your traitor.
- Coward.
- It's not my fault, it's this asshole.
- Stop it. Go ahead.
- Big runner.
Coward, don't flee, stop and fight.
And why don't you reach me?
Reach me and I'll show you...
- Damned.
- Go slowly...
Turn on, horse.
What side is that Feudal?
The man at my service is not afraid neither of the rain nor of the sun...
- The fire or the wind.
- What service? We are all equal.
Silence here. I'm the commander.
So, you own me obedience and submission. Our route will be... covered by sweat, tears and blood. Are you ready for that?
- Everybody at the same time.
- Yes.
- We are.
- Are you ready to... fight to death? We'll set off for days, weeks and months, but... at the end, we'll have castles, treasures and white women... with big teats.
Bigstick, stand up the flags.
- I have no flags.
- All right, stand them up very high.
And you villain, put yourselves under your shade... get out of the mud, I'll turn the five of you a speed army and...
- Sir, we are in four.
- I'll turn the four of you a... speed army, brave that's gonna be a greyhound and a lion at the same time.
Let's go ahead, on the way to
Aurocastro just in the heart of Pulha.
Let's go. Go ahead my hero fellows.
On the road. Go, go.
Follow me.
Where is he going to?
It's over here.
Get out of my way.
You get out.
No, you must to get out.
I'm a Knight.
What about me? You've seen my army.
Don't you have eyes?
- As much as you have a tongue.
- So, what is missing is your brain.
Yes, maybe, but guts I have a lot. On foot or by horse?
No, not by horse, on foot.
My name is Brancaleone da Norcia.
I'm Teofiltall Gain Gold.
From the family Bysantine descendent of
Giveaphoto l, and seen you...
I have pity on you.
Bigstick.
Show him who we are, sir.
My Lord!
- Break.
- Do you want a break?
- What about you?
- Ah!
Yes, a break.
- Axe.
- What?
I said, axe.
An axe!
Squire, an axe.
Is this gonna last forever?
- Look out!
- Let's get out of here.
- Well... That's it.
- That's it.
- A break?
- Ok.
It was the only one. It's history!
Now, let's get the sword.
On guard!
Go... go away.
Let's make the fire 'cause the whole thing is gonna last a lot.
- Is it ready?
- A little more.
Hey.
Do you surrender?
Ouch!
- It's the spleen... yes.
- No...
No...
It's the liver... in there.
- Yes?
- Yes.
It always hurts me.
Boil some alfalfa... chicory... brimstone, mallow, citron-tree, and boil them all... and... drink it all.
- Is it a good medicine?
- Yeah!
It's gonna be inside you giving kicks till everything is clean, then... gets out from your ass a big fire.
It burns, but it cures.
Hey, you there?
Night's coming!
That's the Hebrew Abacuc, he is in charge of the treasures of the army... and he is a great trader, he is at my service.
Salute.
I have an idea. Though you sound pompous, all of you seem to be... in rags. My family is very rich... and would pay a lot for my life.
So, I thought, if I offered myself as a prisoner and go to my... father's Castle to demand a ransom in gold, that is gonna be half and half.
- And then, each one for himself, right?
- And where is this Castle?
Very far, there.
No, there, where the sun's down.
- But, don't we have to go to Aurocastro?
- No way, Aurocastro can wait... for a while we're going to get our gold, hurry up, let's go.
Hurry up? Who are you?
Capricious of Verdict.
- Where did my horse go to?
- We'll go to where I tell you to...
We'll leave and we'll take possession of our feudal, according to the... parchment. All of you need to act with dignity... obedience, decency and submission... but where is the look of the man who keeps the weapons? Out with all... this trash, out with the hanging rags... and with all these old staffs and with the tents.
Discipline! We're the Army of
Brancaleone, blood of Judas.
Blood of Judas.
Wait, wait for me.
My horse ran away.
- Wait, I'll go with you.
- What for?
I'm your prisoner,
I've got to follow you.
Listen, you're free, just take another way and don't disturb us anymore.
Attention, let's go straight ahead.
The stubborn Bizantine continues following us.
Don't mind about him.
Look, a village.
- What village is that?
- For sure it's, San Simonne or...
Bonharollo... or Ancopontanatico or... another place that I've never been to.
- We'll stay here for tonight.
- As you want.
Quick, this way.
Quiet! This silence doesn't make me feel good. Gush!
Let's go very carefully.
Abacuc.
Cover my back.
- What do you expect?
- Let's go.
Let's go together.
What a tomb silence!
What a gloomy!
Hold on!
Did they run away from us?
All the villagers escape when they see armed soldiers.
Well, that's it. By the right of the winner, take everything... you can, hurry up to get to
Aurocastro well dressed, go!
- Go.
- Count on me, let's go.
- Everybody to the cellar.
- We're gonna to devastate this village.
My army will leave its terrible signal. Dura lex, thirsty lex.
- Cucurucu.
- Cucurucu.
Let's enjoy the life, to sin, what's the death?
What's left for you from the life?
Give it a bite.
Let me kiss you.
No! No! Where are you going?
Surrender to me, take me.
Surrender to me. Cucurucu, cucurucu.
Cucurucu.
Surrender, take me.
Let's enjoy and sin.
Cucurucu.
Cucurucu.
Your skin is on fire.
Fever for love!
For you, I can dye.
- No, not that bed.
- Why not?
- How you said: Cucurucu.
- My husband died in it.
- Died? When?
- Yesterday.
- Yesterday? Of what?
- The ill that reached everyone.
The pest.
Let's get out of here.
Let's run.
Help. The pest.
- The pest! It's here.
- Let's leave this place. Come on.
- Run, let's run.
- We're lost, lost.
Come on, let's follow Aquilante, he's an expert in running away.
- Come on, come on, let's go.
- Don't spoil the cloth.
- It'll be our last suit!
- Don't doubt it.
Hurry up. Come on, let's go.
Damned village. Let's go.
- Come on.
- Not so fast.
- What a foolish thing we've done.
- Run, old man.
- Get some wings, old man.
- The chest is gonna break.
Don't worry about that, old man.
You're gonna spoil it.
Oh! M treasure!
Hold on. Hold on, brothers.
Abacuc, Decorum...
Hold on... it doesn't help to run, the death, death's already in all of us.
You damned, I wish I've never seen you all.
My fault...
My fault, my entire fault.
My fault.
My fault.
- Are you happy now?
- My entire fault.
My fault...
Hey...
It's true.
You didn't get into the village.
- You didn't want me to.
- You knew about the pest.
- And didn't say a word about it.
- Stay there.
- Be aware or I'll make a hole on you.
- Bizantine worm.
- We contracted the pest, and you laugh.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna infect you.
- No, no, no.
- Don't do that to me, please!
- Don't let him go. Catch him.
Hold him, let's transmit the ill to him.
Touch him, touch him.
No! Stop it, Christian.
You don't want to suffer the same way we are...
How you can see, we were infected by the pest.
- Pest?
- Pest.
Pest? What a sin!
Fortunate men,
I bring you the salvation...
Join us and save your lives.
Follow me and the terrible harm... won't get you. Take your weapons and come with me to the Holy...
Land to get the
Holy Tomb free...
I promise you that you'll have your body and soul saved. Who purifies the... impure will be pure. Who goes with me to the Holy Land will be cured.
Come on, soldiers of faith, form with me a happy squad.
Everybody to the Holy, Holy
Tomb. God wants this way.
From every harm will be cured who goes with me to the Holy Land.
- I go.
- Before let's ask for a guarantee in...
- A paper that there is cure for all.
- What do you say, son of Judas?
- What about Aurocastro?
- We'll never get there.
What do you prefer, brothers, right death by pest, or what the monk... promised us? It will be the salvation of the life in the Holy Land. Let's go.
Let's go, brothers.
Courage, come on.
To the Holy Lands.
Come you too, Aquilante.
- Why are you here?
- I've got the gout and sand on my teeth.
The good monk guaranteed me health, then we're going to Taranto where... there's an army and many boats, we're going to the Holy Land to fight...
- Against the Africans with the hands.
- That's it... we'll fight one a one against the black people in the Holy Land, and what... about you, my friend, what do you have?
What battle did you lose the arm?
- In Barcelonta? Or against the Swedish?
- In his house, he found me... with his woman, and just because of it he cut my arm.
- Ah!
- After that, we've become... friends, we've packed and... both of us have left... with the monk Zoneone to the Holy Lands.
- I see.
- And I carry on this huge stone...
- For a bigger punishment.
- All right, let's all go fight... everybody to the Holy Lands. What about you, my good man, why are you with us?
- He is leprous.
- It's disgusting.
Hold on! Make lines.
One after the other. Cross on Indian line.
- Monk Zoneone, it doesn't seem safety!
- Men of a little faith...
How can you be afraid of the bridge, if the hand of God is holding it?
Remember Thomas, the incredulous apostle.
Let's remember him and cross it.
Come on, you cowards.
You, Abacuc, who weights a few pounds, will be the first one to cross it.
- Go, go, go.
- Trust.
- Go on Indian line.
- Go, come on.
The hands of God hold you.
Go through and remember Thomas...
Don't you remember Thomas, yeah?
Follow me, come on.
- Don't be afraid.
- Put your faith on the bridge.
- I'm here with you.
- Go ahead, come on.
Let's sing!
The way is so big as much as...
- The goal.
- Big.
Men of a little faith.
Come on, Decorum.
Cross it.
Come on, don't doubt it, it will bring you happiness.
God took His hand away.
But why did he take His hand away?
Do you know?
- No, Priest. We don't know.
- 'Cause among us there're some impure...
Someone here has no faith...
Who has no faith?
- No, everybody has faith.
- Almost everybody.
That one, that one.
- What? Who are you talking about?
- I have my faith.
- Of course, he has.
- He has his own faith.
- We are all friends.
- Right, we are all friends.
- Horror! By the way, are you an heretic?
- No! I'm a Jewish.
There was a serpent among us!
That's the reason of our disgrace.
Let's baptize him.
Let's baptize him, an impure.
It'll be pure who purifies an impure.
Let's go to the waters, to the waters, of the salvation! Let's go to the bath.
- For the purification.
- Calm down, Abacuc.
- Come on, Abacuc, come on.
- Take it easy.
Today is Saint Monsueto's day, and your name will be Monsueto.
Get up warriors pilgrims, why to sleep when it's time... to thank the Lord?
Stand up...
Let's thank the Lord.
And now, another bridge! thank to the Lord, that makes the way to salvation, full of... obstacles.
Let's cross on Indian file.
Follow me.
But, how can you fight in the Holy Lands... if you don't have the faith to cross a bridge?
What are you afraid of? Now, we're pure. There's no dangerous...
- Because the heretic was purified.
- So, he goes first.
Cowards! Cowards, cowards.
Sing and cross, I'll give you and example, the bridge is firm. Look!
Look!
God punishes. That's the way God wants.
Look! That's the proof.
Where are you going, Priest?
- What a flight, ah?
- Yeah, rest in peace.
- And, what to do now?
- Well, let's go back.
- But, what about the pest?
- We're pure. The monk said it.
- He vanished.
- Who gave, gave. Who had, had. did you forget the vows? We'll go back to the Holy Land. That's what God wants.
Peace, peace!
He is right, that's it.
We're free of the vow.
And if from each fact we should extract the meaning... here it is. I doesn't want,
God doesn't want. Am I clear?
- No, wants.
- No, He doesn't want.
Let's go back to our route, come on, straight ahead to Auro... don't mention the place.
Or else they are not going anywhere.
You are right, yeah. Well, fellows... come on, come on. On the road, let's go.
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Liberated.
Come on. Each one for himself.
- Where are you going to?
- No where, exactly.
- Let's go together.
- No where, exactly, but... to the other side.
Soldiers, come here, hurry up.
Jesus Christ!
Help me.
Let me go.
Help me.
- Follow me, my warriors.
- My Holy Mother, helps me.
- Hold on.
- Help.
Hold on!
Help!
Look, when I say, follow me, my warriors... what you have to do is follow me and fight.
Or else, we are gonna have bad moments.
Thank you, my hero.
Thank you.
- My name is Matelda.
- Yeah?
I own you my life.
My tutor.
My tutor!
What a cruel!
- Are you a Gentleman?
- Of course I am.
This is my pupil Matelda, she is gonna marry a noble... the Duke Guccione of Nuts-Frog, if you are a Knight of Sword... you must know the code of honor...
I left my little girl for you to take care, be her father and her mother... her baby-sitter and her sister, her shield and her support... take care of her life, and at most take care of her pureness. Make a swear.
The ward, give me your ward.
He is feeling bad, isn't he?
I swear.
- Aren't we going to Aurocastro anymore?
- Calm down...
- It's the same way.
- No, it's 4 days more on the road.
Take the girl to his future husband.
- I'll give you a good reward.
- How much? How much?
A hundred coins of gold.
- What about 150?
- Abacuc, before the death?
All right.
And where is our gold?
- In a secret place.
- There's a secret place.
- And where, where, where is the place?
- Get my beard up.
Come on, get it up, get it up.
- Oh! Tutor, Tutor. No!
- Ouch, damned, ouch, ouch.
Carefully, it's dangerous.
Carefully.
There is no rush, go down slowly.
Come on quick.
Ah? Did it arrive, ha?
- Yeah. It arrived.
- But it's all wet.
Get it up!
- There we go.
- Whose turn is it?
The girl's turn.
I'm scared.
Come with me.
Get it up.
Come on.
Hold on.
- Going down.
- Slowly.
Go it down. Slowly.
Slowly.
Close to you I feel safety.
I wonder if it will be this way with my future husband?
Ah? What do you think?
This... this guy Guccione, how is he, ah? Is he... is he blond? Or brunette?
- Or what?
- I don't know him.
The husband who I've dreamed about has to be... tall, strong, a good looking, like you.
What's the matter with you, Gentleman?
I can feel your heart beating a lot.
- Stop it.
- The rope twisted, make something.
What can I do?
- Don't be afraid.
- No, I'm not afraid.
Hold on.
I take care of it.
Courage, you can jump.
The little safe.
My father, the Baron of Norcia, died when I was nine years old.
My mother got married so, married to a perverse man... who, eager for my treasures, gave me to his foreman... that new how to use a knife very well, to kill me.
But he didn't do it, he had pity on me and abandoned me in the forest... where I could survive myself.
And where I grew up free and strong like a jaguar.
When I was 20 years old I went to the castle to claim for what was mine... however, my mother and my step-father were dead... after exterminate with all the goods.
And when I said, I'm Brancaleone, the unique legitimate heir... of everything that they left to me, the
Policy Captain shouted: Yeah? So... you'll pay the debts. Catch him.
Then, I took the sward, I hurt two of the officers and I had to run.
Since then, I'm walking around fighting.
Cover yourself. What are you doing?
- Crooked ones, what are you looking at?
- Why? Can't we look?
- No.
- I look.
- No, don't look, no.
- Ah! Let's look, yeah.
Because of the young lady we are not going to...
Aurocastro, at least she can amuse us.
- Besides, get out of my sight.
- You Pilatos of Bysantium how dare you?
- Go back to the lines.
- They are claiming because... you're getting far away from Aurocasto to take me to Nuts-Frog.
They are soldiers, they claim, but accept my hard discipline.
- But they are full of right.
- What did you say?
You must get back to your way.
What about you?
I'm gonna with you.
Scratch my back.
If you want me, I'll go.
We'll have great kids for the new lineage of the Brancaleones.
I'll be your faithful wife and you, a husband deep in love because...
I know that you love me as I love you.
I'll give you my pureness. I will.
Matelda! Matelda! I beg you, don't tempt me, I gave my ward.
Don't take me to Guccione,
I don't want him. I want you.
Me, your little sheep, take me, Leone.
- No, no.
- Nobody will have me, then.
Catch the girl.
Matelda?
Matelda, wait.
Matelda.
Stop, Aquilante.
It's an order.
Stop, it's an order.
Aquilante, stop, stop.
- Why don't you get some sleep?
- I'm not sleepy.
- Tomorrow you are not gonna sleep.
- Why not?
You'll be given to Guccione tomorrow.
The Brights make the night a day.
Go away.
Wait.
- I didn't want Guccione.
- Ah?
And didn't he want you?
That damned asshole.
And he sword to keep you pure.
But I want to change this.
Tonight.
Matelda!
Matel... but...
Weren't you in a hurry to take me to Guccione?
Well, I'm ready.
You sleep too much, come on, hurry up.
Move, you lazy horse, we got just one minute.
Look, over there.
- Cheers to the fiancée.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- But, why are we stopped in here?
We've to go right to the point.
Ah! Guccione invited us to the wedding.
- I couldn't say no.
- Get my advice.
We'll go tomorrow.
Eat something to get your strength back.
Guccione is an obscene man.
And he'll be the first guy to catch...
- That flower.
- He can be not the first one.
- What did you say?
- No... it's that if you had caught... the flower when she offered you...
Maybe you are right, but what could I do?
We could get the road, pick up our things and leave.
Ah! But, why the rush?
Have a drink.
We're gonna leave, my sweet wife.
- Take my advice, let's go now.
- It wouldn't be correct.
- Isn't it time to stop drinking?
- I want to drink to forget.
So, let me drink, too.
Do you want a fruit?
Hey? I'm talking to you.
What's the matter with you?
Did you get nuts?
They went to the nuptial room, the party is over, let's go.
It's over? It's not over, it has just started.
The harm caused by love, it's just cured by another one.
Sweety, what do you want to do now?
You want me to make love with you, ah?
You want to eat me. Right?
Bigstick, throw me another fruit.
A very ripe one.
Are you ready?
Look, I'm gonna eat you.
It's good! But not in front of everybody. Let's go upstairs... there is a room there just for us.
- Let's go.
- Not yet. The whole thing's starting.
Hold on everyone.
What is going on?
Tell me who did it?
- Who did what?
- Abused of her.
I want to know who did it.
- He.
- No! I swear to God.
Matelda! Matelda. How could you say such a perverse thing... when you felt on your own flesh how is to keep a word?
- Catch him.
- Come on, my hero fellows...
Branca, Branca, Branca.
Damned!
It's a painting.
Go back, you damned.
Or else, I'll put fire on you.
Army, over here.
Oh! Look out, I'm here.
Oh! Mercy, don't hurt me!
Brancaleone, over here!
Come on, my soldiers.
Branca, Branca.
Ah! Help! Help!
Don't hurt me.
Let me go.
And what about our coins of gold that are with you?
Get out of here.
The money was given for what... you haven't done. So, we've confiscated them all. And you are... lucky not to be killed. Get out, or else you'll turn like your... commander. As an example for all, he'll stay in a cage... for days, weeks, months, till he's devoured by crows and falcons.
Get out of here, and don't come back.
Hey, commander, we are here. Come on.
Very good. You're loyal.
It's a merit.
- Do you know anything about Matelda?
- No. I hope she's dead.
- Take me out of here, come on.
- Let's see what we can do...
Stay there, for a while.
Go... come on, old man, help.
Come on.
Hey! Gush, how you weight, you damned Christian.
No... don't put your hand. It's gonna fall down, take your hands off!
- It's gonna fall down.
- It was stimulating.
Damned shot.
Open up. Come on.
- They can bite.
- Sure. Let's go to the trench.
- Let's cross the trench.
- Come on, come on. Go, go, go.
- Is it bottom?
- No, it's shallow, you can...
- Cross it.
- I trust in you.
Where is the forger?
- Why do you want a forger?
- To open a cage.
A job? He is on the bridge, but go fast.
- One, one and a half, two, two and a...
- Hold on, hold on, Forger.
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone.
- Hold him.
- What are you doing?
- I caught him.
- That's ok. I'll hold him.
I wanna die.
- She's cheating on me.
- Hold him, don't let him go.
I wanna die.
- A little more.
- My wife ran away... with a soldier.
She's cheating on me.
I want to kill myself.
We made it.
- Are you thinking of her?
- Who else could it be?
- Take it, it's soft.
- Ah! Ah! Be aware.
Why did she do that?
It wasn't me that have abused of her.
You couldn't do that, when the woman offers herself, it's dangerous to say no.
- She gets a revenge.
- I couldn't have her... she was pure like a pigeon!
Of course she said yes to the to the tricks of a villain.
If I put my hands on him,
I swear to God.
He only did what you must have done, if you were an expert about woman.
I gave my ward to keep her pure.
Brancaleone da Norcia will never injure a virgin.
- Virgin, she?! Maybe a piranha.
- How dare you?
Worm Bizantine. Liar. Dirty snake. Cynical detractor.
I'm gonna spank you. I'm gonna catch you. Wait till I catch you, ouch, ouch.
I'll catch you.
Oh, shit, not again.
This is the cage, open it up, fast
'cause we have to leave.
Hold this.
I hope we go, without stopping, to Aurocastro.
I can't wait to get there, to lay on a very soft place.
Do you think we'll have servants to do the things for us there?
Servants?
Servants and more servants.
What are we waiting for, let's get to the Fortress, I'm an old man... and I'm always in pain.
I need to get some good sleep, good food, a good drink and stay...
- Doing nothing.
- Yeah.
- Where are you going to?
- To the land of pleasure.
We're happy soldiers of the noble
Gentleman. Glorious Commander...
- And a fabulous hero. Come with us, too.
- When does he arrive, when?
- Who?
- The noble Gentleman.
The commander, the fabulous hero?
It's he.
What are you doing?
- Come back, where are you going?
- To the river, to the river.
- Don't do that.
- He's leaving.
Asshole.
Ask me to apology you, you son of a piranha.
You are mad at me, you're suffering because of the barefaced Matelda.
A thousand times cursed. Matelda was the last ward that you... spelled in your life.
Take that one.
I'll kill you.
What's this about? For Matelda?
Are they combating for her?
Hey?
- You don't need to kill each other.
- What do you mean?
- I saw Matelda today. She was crying.
- Where did you see her?
In a car escorted by soldiers of the
Duke Guccione. She was going to a...
- Convent for the rest of her life.
- Aquilante.
To the convent...
Fast like a ray.
Damned stirrup!
- A foreigner is coming.
- Who let him get in?
Matelda?
Matelda?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Matelda.
Matelda?
I'm here.
I'm here, and so kind that I say to you... come with me. I don't want to know who was the villain that abused of you.
Come with me, let's start our lives again.
We'll have great kids, everything as you wanted.
- No.
- I didn't understand the meaning...
- Of the last ward.
- Too late.
I have now a very different husband.
What are you talking about?
I know I was very bad with you.
And I'm here to atone for what I did.
But now, I only can love Him...
- Forgive me, good-bye.
- Matelda?
Matelda, come with me, or else I...
Will kill me? You can do that, my mission will finish earlier.
Cut my head off.
Hey?
Are you feeling something, milord?
Your Lord, my dear, suffered a hard stroke.
He found his great love on the dangerous way of weapons.
He had to resign to keep his ward.
You know my dear, what happened then? The pain... that my heart had to hold up.
Now your commander, says to his doctrine, do you know what's in this... world the reward for the human sacrifice? A kick in the ass.
From now on I'll be called
The Bitter Gentleman.
Or something like that.
You too?!
- Where are you going?
- This way.
- No, this way.
- Why that way?
- The wind comes from here.
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.
- Do you know where we are?
Beyond the jungle is my castle.
And I offer you again...
I pretend I'm your prisoner and ask to my father the ransom in gold.
That's it, so, we can buy clothes, weapons and some horses.
- Let's go scoria.
- That's okay... then. Down there, there is current water, we're gonna get to the...
Bizantine castle tidied as this army has to be.
To the bath dirty worriers.
You, and specially you, to the bath.
Ah! I knew it.
- What a freak people. Who are they?
- The last dukes of Bysantium... precious blood and very sick.
Hectic limbs, weak using the sward... but fast using the dagger. People that you better lose than found.
- What about that empty place?
- It's my father's.
- Time for his prayer, let's wait.
- Do you know what I'm gonna do?
Ask to your father a thousand of coins of gold. Thinking again, two thousand.
- Who's that pale but appetizing lady?
- My sister.
No, not that one, the other one, that looks like a piranha.
My mother.
What do you say about aunt Teodora?
She killed her husband with a poisoned...
- Dagger sending him directly to hell.
- Jesus Christ.
To please her lover.
Which one?
That one with the bowl.
- His name is Type.
- My goodness!
You have to drink it, hot wine with spices.
Aren't you afraid of the pain?
I liked you.
You're welcome.
I'll cure your hand.
She...
- Go! She's a great lover.
- What about type? Doesn't he mind?
Yes, he does.
- But, do you care?
- Of course not.
- So?
- I'm in charge of the negotiations.
But with respect, don't be too fast.
I'm going to take a big cash from them.
I'm Brancaleone da Norcia.
Do you know to make love the same way you know how to suffer the pain?
Yeah, but actually a long time I...
Pleasure and pain... are the same.
I don't know, maybe.
- Do you want to make it?
- Of course I want!
- Take off your clothes.
- Right now.
Come on, damned buckle.
It's gonna be this way. Let's make it.
Let's make it, let's make it.
- Make it, make it.
- What's that, woman? Are you crazy?
- Ouch, stop it, stop it.
- Take it, spank me, too.
- Ouch, I'm gonna take it, I go. Wait.
- Take it, go ahead.
- That's what you want? Right.
- That's it, spank me again.
You bizantine. Take it!
Do you like it? So, take it.
No, not on me! No!
- I love you.
- I love you.
Stop it!
Sancirilo Abacuc, master of finances of Lord Brancaleone... that made your son his prisoner, after a combat, and the old people... say great value, great price. And the value of your son is great.
But, considering your tender heart of a father, we'll ask you a lower value.
- Three thousand.
- Three thousand what?
- Coins of gold, no?
- No.
No? Are you letting your son as a prisoner...
Submissive to hard works?
And abandoned, doesn't your heart gets hurt as a father?
- We'll do it for two...
- No.
You can take him, and you can spank him as you want...
- I'm gonna like it.
- It went wrong.
He's the shame of the family, the white sheep, a thief and a tramp...
He is the bastard son I had with a servant of mine against my will.
Neither a coin of gold, nor a tin, he doesn't worth it.
That's right, but he is your son.
One thousand and everybody is happy.
You're the trashy accomplices of Scant?
If the bell rings for the third time... and you aren't out of here you'll be be killed by poisoned arrows.
Poisoned arrows. Look at them.
You bastard, I wish I've never seen you before.
Wait. Abacuc, how much did you get?
Where are you going, ah?
Why are you running?
What's going on?
Take your weapons.
Betrayal, let's run away.
I cover the back.
Come on, hurry up. Come on.
Let's go, quickly.
- You should tell us you were a bastard.
- Neither I knew it.
- So, you're my relative.
- And mine, too.
Hold on. I see signal of smoke.
Watch out.
These lands are unknown and wild. Two brave men are going... to open the way. You stay here.
You go.
- A bear.
- Ah?
Did he make a fire?
It's not a daddy bear, by the head and by the ears it looks like a mummy bear.
And a bear does that?
- Look.
- That guy is Decorum.
Let's go over there.
What?
- Ah! What do you want?
- We thought you had died...
- Are you with the bear?
- Come on.
Go, go.
- Did you see her?
- Of course.
- Does she bite?
- No, she is gentle.
She found me in pieces, and took care of me and... took me to the cave like she was my Godmother.
But I don't claim, one day I eat chestnut, the other day, chicory... or else a frog and I'm still alive.
So, let's go, good luck.
No, wait, I'm going with you.
But, let's go slowly.
If she notice she's gonna eat us.
- She's like an animal. Come on.
- But...
Decorum, she is looking for you.
Go... go.
Run.
She is there.
- She is mad.
- Run away.
Be a good girl, I'm going with my friends. I'll come back soon.
Help me! Wait for me.
Help.
Hold on.
We'd better stay here.
Be careful.
Yeah, old man, you found a good excuse for not walk.
I'm very sick.
Little Christians, I'm really bad.
No, what bad? You're just a little ill.
Soon you'll get strong again, listen to the old Branca.
My time is over, I know it.
I already don't have the pain on my foot.
- I'm tired.
- Abacuc...
But if it's what you say,
I think you're gonna be okay.
I don't know if you die, you'll go to our Christian paradise.
Or of your people, or of the God you've had before.
For sure, I believe that it'll be better than the life...
- We are having here.
- I think so, too.
You are not going to be cold, neither hot.
Neither hungry, nor thirsty.
- Neither spanks.
- Nor scares.
You'll have a heaven always beautiful.
Birds and flowered trees.
Angels that will give you big breads, cheeses, wine and milk.
And they'll say: do you want, old man?
Eat. Do you want more? Take it. Eat... drink till you get satisfied.
Sleep, sleep.
Sleep.
Lucky old man!
Hold on.
Look, men, look.
That is Aurocastro!
Look it now, men of a little faith.
It's a sound!
The sound of the ring of Zoneone, you abandoned too early the happiness.
The monk's back.
Who are you talking about?
Who's this monk?
Get on your knees.
- It's a cow!
- A cow! A cow.
A cow! God doesn't want you to suffer anymore. Branca, Branca.
Citizens of Aurocastro, open up the gates for your Lord... that came by imperial will to guide you, to protect you and... to administrate you, open it up for Brancaleone... da Norcia and Aurocastro and for his army.
I'm Quarentino, an ancient of this village, this is the key of the city.
Follow me to the Fortress and I'll show you what belongs to you. Come on.
- One moment, the lmperial possession.
- You don't need to. You'll read it later.
Your coming make us happy.
It's the end of the time of favors.
And they are not a few. Come on, we can't waist the time.
Here it's the cellar. We've left a little wine in there.
We'll drink.
We are all happy, with your presence.
Now that you are here, show us that you are brave men. Are you seen something?
A black flag.
It's the damned ones, they are back.
Like every year... for a new pillage. Give them a lesson so, they are never coming... back here to rob anymore.
Thank you, Gentleman, and to you and to the Great Lord of Saxon... that nominated you, go fighting our defenders, attack with violence... those sanguinary. Fight and God be with you. With all of you.
But... what sanguinary?
The Saracen!
It's explained now what is written in that parchment...
"The black danger that comes from the sea".
It's the Saracen pirates that come every year from the sea to...
- Sack.
- It had to end up this way, I was an...
- Idiot to follow you.
- Old Branca, we got screw.
Friends, brothers, soldiers, there's only one thing to do: To run away!
What are you saying, Mangotree?
We have only one thing to do: to fight!
This is our Fortress, they are people that are trusting on us and... put their hopes on us.
We deserve the title we came here to have.
Bigstick, I nominated you,
"Primus Milis."
The squad of yours, will have
Captain Teofiltall, and... and below Mangotree,
"Millis Simplicius".
Vito, I want to give you a proof of my esteem. With a good news...
I nominated you, Master of Weapons.
We have to be firm till night to discourage the... enemy and encourage the peasants to come back, to fight and to win.
The Saracen are coming.
Run away!
- They are going to put the gate down.
- It's a little rotten.
Don't be afraid, men.
I have a plan that will exterminate the enemy.
Let's see.
Take off the board that cover the cellar.
Aquilante, where are you?
Where are you? I have a job for you.
Get these ropes, hooks and pulleys prepared. Aquilante, come here.
Take it easy. The gate can take the first strokes. Calm down.
Calm down.
Hey, you. What are you seen?
- They are starting it over.
- Ah! That's what I need.
Prepare a great quantity of rocks.
It will have their function when the moment comes.
And now listen to me. The Saracen'll throw themselves with a big arch, right?
He's going to resist. But the gate's going to open like the arms of... a lover, and the Saracen, pushed by their own...
- Strength, will fall into the trench.
- Do you think that the horse is gonna... pull the rope that opens the gate to your command?
Bigstick, get your sling ready.
The useless horse hit by the projectile of our slinger... is gonna move, for sure.
Master Vito, be alert. Listen, are you seen the gate?
- It's only what I can see.
- That's enough.
When you see they opening the gate and falling into the trench... to close the trench... you cut the rope with your vigorous sward.
Take it, did you hear me?
I heard you very well.
Decorum, you'll put fire to the ray and you'll throw it into the trench... to burn the infidels. Teofiltall and Mangotree get prepared... stretch the arrow. The plan was elaborated very carefully. Now...
I'm going to tell you how to move precisely and in order.
Go, Bigstick.
Keep on alert, my hero.
Till now, you are covered by shit, cover yourself with glory now.
- Commander?
- What happened?
- It wasn't my fault.
- Decorum, Mangotree...
- What happened? What's going on?
- Help me.
- Give me the hand.
- Put all your strength, that's it.
- Damned asshole.
- What a hell darkness is that?
Open up. We are going to close the lines again. Open up.
Vito, the heavens are gonna curse you. Open up.
I barely know them!
My beautiful river, my pretty anvil.
- Damned parchment.
- And damned Moorish that came...
- From the sea.
- No more crying.
You always lived like women, try at least to die... like men.
You call this die like a man?
- Did you see, Teofiltall? Look!
- Who are they?
Christians soldiers.
- They arrived on time.
- Come on, my rescuers.
- Cheers for the Christendom!
- They came to save us.
Attack.
Carefully, carefully, brothers.
Don't cut the rope.
We thank our Holy Mother.
God bless you, Gentleman, thank you very much.
- You saved us, God bless.
- I'm your slave.
Glorious Gentleman, without you,
I won't be here now to thank you... and shaking your hands and all your men.
Brancaleone da Norcia.
Master and owner of Aurocastro.
Their vineyards and their cattle.
I ask your permission, my dear Lord, to have you here as hosts... to eat and to drink in my castle.
What?
Nice end.
It's not the end you should claim, but the beginning.
I was deceived by that parchment.
It's true. It's our fault, if we're here now... forgive us, Brancaleone.
Is it use now to demand? We need to love and to forgive at death's time.
We need to love and to forgive.
Listen, Brancaleone,
I wasn't a good guy for you too...
- And I want to confess my faults.
- You don't need to, brother.
We arrived at this point, no way out.
We need to love and to forgive... at death's time.
We need to love and to forgive.
I ask for your forgiveness.
It was me that abused of Matelda.
You disgraceful traitor.
You dirty man.
You crappy bizantine.
I'm going to exterminate you...
I'm going to exterminate you, damned.
- The bells of Zoneone.
- It's a cow, a cow.
Shut up.
- It's him!
- It's Zoneone. Zoneone.
- Brother.
- Who's that?
- Zoneone.
- Zoneone, Zoneone!
Hold on, I don't know who you're and why you want to burn the men.
- That's it, monk.
- But their lives belong to me...
- We belong to you.
- Listen to me, Saint Man...
- They are traitors and deserve to die.
- Yes, they do...
As all of us.
But their lives are not yours... but of the Lord that is in heaven, and He said that... it'll be pure who'd purify the impure.
- I want to be pure.
- All of them swore to go with me... to the Holy Land, to fight against the infidel, and nobody can... take any man from the lines that wants to die happy for the Saint Sepulcher.
Keep on your knees, Christians.
- On your knees.
- Obey, obey.
- That's the way God wants.
- Obey.
Aquilante?
Ah! I never doubted you.
Come on, my faithful animal.
Give me the sward.
Well, my brave men, leave all the discouragement behind you... chest out... stand up the weapons, flags up, self confidence... and let's forget Aurocastro, across the sea blood and glory... are waiting for us, like the wolf that attacks and the lion that goes ahead... we keep walking till the Holy Land.
Branca, Branca, Branca.
Lisa, Paris is on the phone.
- About the hemline again? I'll take it.
- Mm-hmm.
Hello? Please, Paris.
It has been decided.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's correct.
- Lisa, how do you like this?
- It's very nice. Just fine.
- Put it through immediately.
- Thank you.
Lovely.
The color, the drama!
- It is fantastic!
- It's glorious!
Blast off.
Why not?
Come along, ladies.
Ladies. Ladies!
- Will you leave us, please? Thank you.
- Indicates a perfect orbit.
Right now we're waiting for the computers to answer the question.
Then, we'll have an announcement from one of the men responsible.
Yes, that's it.
We have an announcement.
Ladies and gentlemen, Lloyd C. Cramden.
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we've done it.
The first manned space platform in history is moving into a perfect orbit!
And this is only the beginning.
In the weeks to come, other rockets containing weather instruments, cameras, mapping and surveying equipment... will join up with our platform... making it the first scientific laboratory in outer space.
- Think of it, ladies and gentlemen.
- We've done it. We've done it!
- Nobody can stop us now!
- Ladies, please!
This accomplishment will add immeasurably to our scientific knowledge... and will usher in a new era of goodwill... as the platform passes across all national boundaries...
Oh, uh, excuse me, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's the president calling Mr. Cramden.
I want to congratulate you on your part in this magnificent achievement, Lloyd.
Thank you, sir. Thank you.
I must say, now that it's over,
I can use a little relaxation.
Right. Now you can relax. I was thinking about a little round of g-o-I-f.
Very good. When do you suggest, sir?
- Tomorrow.
- Thank you, sir.
Uh-huh. Good enough. See you then.
Next week, same time, same station.
And now let's return to our on-the-spot coverage... Uh, Colonel.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Colonel...
- Uh, Carter, Colonel Carter.
- Colonel Carter. Right.
You must be an old ball player, Colonel.
For a moment there, I thought you were making signals like a third-base coach.
What? Oh, this.
Habit, I guess.
But this space shot does put us back in the ball game, doesn't it?
- This is quite a day.
- "Does put us back in the ball game, doesn't it?"
Men.
But he's right about one thing:
This is quite a day.
- That is, Helena, if...
- Oh, forgive me, dear.
I must have my moment of drama.
I will bring him right in.
Please, sir. Come with me.
Now you will see the final results of 37 operations.
Sit down here.
Now.
- Voila!
- My God!
He's, he's perfect!
You see? It is possible.
Yes, it can be done.
Ladies, I have done what I promised.
- The next step is up to you.
- He's wonderful.
Remarkable.
Now just sit tight up there.
Tomorrow we begin.
- Operation Duffer.
- Operation Duffer!
Duffer! Duffer!
Duffer!
Operation Duffer!
Duffer!
Watch me very carefully, Lloyd.
You've been trying to kill the ball.
Brute power is not the answer.
Golf and life itself have one thing in common: Success is based on timing.
- I'm only down three holes, sir.
- Well, that's all we've played.
Now, Lloyd, I'm going to give you a little lesson on that swing of yours.
- You got your stopwatch?
- Oh, yes, sir.
All right now.
Watch me very carefully, and remember, it's all in the timing.
- Start your watch.
- Hold it, Mr. President.
It's all right.
Nothing to be alarmed about.
Well, boys, it's the president.
My apologies, sir.
That's all right, sir. Hello, boys.
- Hi.
- How do you do?
Ask him for his autograph.
Gosh, Mr. President, if you'd autograph your golf ball for me,
I'd put it right next to my picture of Batman.
- Martin, comparing the president...
- Perfectly normal, sir.
When I was his age, the president ran a poor second to Babe Ruth.
- Lloyd, let's have yours.
- Yes, sir.
- There you are, sonny. Come over here.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
And here is one for you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you very... Oh.
Here's one for you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much again.
- You're welcome.
- That was very kind of you, sir.
My pleasure, sir.
- Time me, Lloyd, with your stopwatch.
- Yes, sir.
- Lloyd?
- Huh?
- Did you get that?
- Yes, sir.
What was it?
Three... Three min...
Now, if this watch is right, something else is terribly wrong.
- But you could be mistaken, sir.
- I wish I were, Avery, but three minutes went by that I can't account for.
Three minutes in the life of the president.
It's not just irregular, it's irrational.
Irrational.
Exactly like the problem, sir.
You're right, damn it.
Get me that book on dogs.
- On what, sir?
- Dogs. I'm gonna see Flint.
Uh-huh. All right.
All right. Thank you.
You're right. Our man's in the White House, but Cramden has turned to Flint for help.
You see how predictable, this childish masculine loyalty?
- The Flint file.
- It's quite a dossier.
- It's very impressive.
- Yes, yes. I know.
- Weaknesses?
- Yes. Three of them.
I'll leave for New York.
"Avoid tension.
"A dog can sense fear.
Show him you're his friend.
Offer him food. "
And, ladies, at Fabulous Face, we offer completely individual beauty treatments.
For example, if you happen to enjoy a full body massage, we can...
I'm sure it's very nice, Miss Norton, but I don't think we really need to leave town for a massage.
- And, besides,
I don't think we've got the time.
As soon as Derek gets back, we leave for Rio.
Well, that's just perfect.
Our place Fabulous Face is right in the islands, just a short flight from Rio, right on your way.
Please, say you'll come.
Derek can pick us up on the way back from the desert.
- That's just marvelous.
- Great. I'll tell him.
- Oh, is he here?
- Why, yes.
Pardon me.
You're supposed to smile, sir.
Then he'll let go.
Oh.
You must be Mr. Cramden, right?
Uh, yes, but I don't remember our meeting before.
No, we're new. All of us.
- All of you?
- Excuse us. We won't be long.
- This way, Mr. Cramden.
- Yes.
Derek is out at the pool.
He said to bring you along.
Thank you.
Simple. I'm hungry.
I'm hungry.
Oh, Mr. Cramden.
- Uh...
- May I get you a cup of coffee, a drink?
- A cigar... any one of his favorite cigars.
- Thank you.
- Huh?
- No, no, no. I gave them up. I had to, uh...
- Thank you, young lady.
- Thank you, darling.
- Isn't she lovely?
- And... Yeah.
By the way, w-what happened to the old girls?
I mean, the other one.
- Oh, they're married.
- Ah, happily, I expect.
- Oh.
- Oh, naturally. Why wouldn't they be?
They certainly were well... Well, um...
- Prepared?
- Oh, naturally.
But, uh, tell me.
Didn't there used to be four?
Well, there were five at one time, sir, but that got to be a little too much.
See, I'm trying to cut down.
Come on, Eric. You've had your lunch.
Now, sir, what's on your mind?
That, that fish out there. You don't...
No. Sir, a dolphin is a mammal.
Actually, a member of the cetacean group.
Whales, sir.
- Whales.
- Very intelligent animals.
Right. Oh, good. What's one more mammal in this household, eh?
But he doesn't live here.
He's just staying a few weeks... while I compile a dictionary on dolphin sounds.
A dictionary on dolphin s...
Well, not words, sir.
See, we communicate by sonic waves.
It's part of an experiment in isomerism.
- Terry.
- Isomerism.
- Isomerism, sir.
- Isome... Isome...
Isomerism.
Yes, isomerism, sir... the relationship between two or more nuclei to the same mass numbers.
Let's go to the library. Actually, they have the same mass and atomic numbers.
It's just, there are different states of energy and radioactive decay.
If it were not important, I...
It's simply radiant energy transmitted by pressure waves at the speed of sound.
That's very interesting, but my reason for being here...
Now, by controlling the frequency of the sound wave, we can produce a musical tone.
- For instance...
- Flint, this is important.
Yet, all solid objects can be destroyed by the proper pitch.
- That's extraordinary.
- Ah, it's a toy.
However, we are making such scientific strides... that last year's book is already outdated.
How do you find time to read?
No, no. I wrote that. Already obsolete.
Flint, I've got to talk to you in private.
Oh, yes. Excuse me, sir. Terry?
- Would you mind...
- Not at all.
Thank you, baby.
Mmm.
Oh.
Now, Flint, something happened when
I was playing golf with the president.
Oh, the president! Well...
Oh, yes.
I don't know where to begin.
I- It just doesn't seem to make sense.
Well, I'm sure it will, sir.
Just, um...
Well, you know I haven't been playing up to my game.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Well...
So the president felt my timing was off.
So he asked me to time his swing with this stopwatch. Well...
- Oh, I see. So, uh... Yes, uh-huh.
- Yeah.
Flint, it took three minutes.
Now that's not possible, is it?
- Uh, no, sir. It's not.
- No.
The, uh, the watch... now you've had it checked, of course.
Oh, of course.
That's very interesting.
Would you like me to look into this?
That's what I was hoping.
I can take care of it in about a week, sir.
- A week?
- Well, why? Is it urgent?
- Well, no, I guess...
- Oh, fine then, sir.
I'll contact you as soon as I get back from Death Valley.
- Death Valley?
- Yes, a survival test.
- Derek?
- Yeah, baby.
Miss Norton has invited us to be her guests at Fabulous Face while you're away.
Fabulous Face? What's that?
It's that great new health resort in the Virgin Islands.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- It's just a couple of hours to Rio.
- I'll check the airlines.
- Yeah.
- Fabulous Face?
- Besides, you'll be gone that week anyway.
Hmm.
You're very convincing, Miss Norton.
The resort must be quite a place.
Believe me, Mr. Flint, it is.
I, uh, do hope you'll allow them to come.
- Why not?
- Ladies, perhaps you ought to start packing.
- Well, thank you very much, Miss Norton.
- Thank you.
Oh, sir. Where was I?
The desert. That's right.
Well, it's not really too difficult to know where to find food.
Food in the de... Thank you.
In the desert?
Oh, yes, sir. It's all around you, if you know where to find it.
- Snakes, lizards, chiefly edible grubs.
- Oh!
- Grubs?
- Yes, they're found in decaying wood, under rocks, shrubs.
- Grubs?
- Grubs, sir.
Yes. Larvae, pupae.
Anglicized from Latin vermiculus.
One of the most edible worms that we have in the western hemisphere.
Have the appearance of macaroni.
Uh, if you'd like some more conventional food, how about dinner with me tonight at Luigi's?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I have some packing to do.
Ah, that's all right.
I'll let myself out.
Oh, well, then. All right, sir.
Give my best to Luigi.
If you want something really special, try his Vermicelli a la Derek Flint.
- Vermicelli a la Derek Flint.
- I'll see you as soon as I get back.
- Good-bye, Miss Norton.
- Good-bye, Mr. Flint.
Grubs. Ew!
Uh, grubs.
- Table, miss?
- Yes, please. That table right there.
Oh, certainly.
Good evening.
Would you care for a cocktail?
Yes, please.
Oh, I'll have a martini.
- Mm-hmm.
- Very dry.
Yes, ma'am.
- Oh!
- Oh, dear.
- Allow me.
- Oh, thank you. How awful of me.
- Oh, no.
- How terribly clumsy.
- Not at all.
- Thank you so much.
I... Um, I'm afraid this will sound quite familiar, sort of a line, as it were, but... haven't we met?
Oh, no. No, I don't believe so.
You see, this is my first trip here to New York.
- Oh, well...
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
- Would the gentleman care for a drink?
- Well, I'm...
- Uh...
I'm not expecting anyone.
That isn't a line either.
Won't you join me?
Well, I-I'd, I'd love to, I'd love to...
- I'll have a cognac, please.
- Yes, sir.
Uh, may I introduce myself?
I'm Lloyd Cramden.
And I'm Norma Benson.
Oh.
Um... would you please give me a light?
Well...
Thank you.
Here.
Thank you.
My trip here has to be a very short one.
Schoolteachers are not in the higher income brackets.
Oh.
I never had a teacher as beautiful as you.
Perhaps it was just as well.
It would have been too distracting.
Oh, you're very flattering, Mr. Cramden.
Truthful would be more accurate.
Just... where do you teach?
I teach at the
John C. Calhoun High School... in Roanoke, Virginia.
Roanoke, Virginia.
But let's not talk about me.
It's, uh... quite evident that you're in a much more important position.
Hmm. No. Well, I...
I'm just one of the many thousands of government workers.
- Oh, how nice.
- Uh, to the school system.
Especially Roanoke, Virginia.
And to a very charming representative of our government.
- Uh, what?
- I'm sure you can explain this, sir.
- Who is... Wait!
- Pardon me, dearie.
- I don't know.
- I'll have to take you into custody.
- What?
- I'll arrange for an audience with the president... first thing in the morning, and any decision will be made by him.
- Cooper, you and Austin take Mr. Cramden to the car.
- I'll question the woman.
- I never...
- This way.
- There's a mistake.
You're not listening.
I don't even remember registering.
So, you met this woman for the first time, had a couple of drinks with her, and you can't recall anything that happened afterward?
I can only conclude, sir, that the drink must have been drugged.
What does your report show,
General Carter?
The waiter in the restaurant didn't get a good look at the woman, sir.
As for the glasses they drank from, the lab reports show no trace of a drug.
- And the schoolteacher?
- No criminal record, sir.
TheJohn C. Calhoun High School of Roanoke, Virginia.
Oh, yes, sir. We checked it out.
TheJohn C. Calhoun High School was vacated quite a few years ago, at our request.
I'm afraid there's a security angle involved, Mr. President.
Well, go on, General Carter.
Let's have the whole story.
Well, that school became one of our top secret installations... training center for Special Forces Project K-14.
Lloyd, can you shed any light at all on this?
- No, sir.
- And the woman in the hotel room?
Skid Row, sir. I'm sorry, Mr. Cramden.
Lloyd,
I know what a dedicated servant you've been to me... and to the country we both love so dearly.
I'm sure you'll be vindicated at your hearing.
Until then, you're under suspension.
However, you may continue to use your office and the assistance of Lieutenant Avery.
- We'll try to keep this out of the newspapers.
- Oh, thank you, sir.
You can be sure of one thing, though, Lloyd.
I'll never turn my back on you.
General Carter.
- Yes, sir.
- There's a couple of security issues we better discuss now.
Oh, yes, Mr. President. I've outlined some of the major issues in this...
Sir, this is more important than the missing three minutes.
- I'm certain Flint can help.
- Flint?
What a field day he could have at my expense.
Oh.
She was ugly, sir.
Hmm?
Oh.
Well, you can forget about Flint.
He's going to be leaving very shortly.
Then we have no time to lose.
May I have your permission?
Well, fine.
Thank you, sir.
- Hey, Bill.
- Hi, Mr. Flint.
- Empty all the ash trays?
- No, I got you a new plane.
Ah, beautiful. Let's go.
So, damn it, Flint, you know I'm no Don Juan.
Yes, I'm sure of that, sir.
The question is, since raw animal passion is ruled out, what was the woman's motive?
Raw animal... See here, Flint...
- It is ruled out, I assume.
- Yeah, well, yeah, no. Of course it's ruled out.
- You should have seen her without her makeup.
- I'm sure it was traumatic.
Yeah.
Now just take your time, sir.
Relax.
Breathe... deeply.
Now... try to remember.
You're in Luigi's.
What?
You're in Luigi's.
What happened?
She, uh, dropped her purse.
Yes?
And I, uh, tried to help her.
And then we, uh, introduced ourselves.
And she wanted a cigarette,
so I lit a couple of cigarettes, and...
Hmm?
Cigarettes. Matches.
- What about it?
- Paper, please.
Huh? Paper... please.
- Uh...
- Hold still one moment, sir.
- Yes.
- Huh?
Paper.
Hmm.
Hmm. Interesting. Singed, of course.
Singed?
There's some styrax, ylang, mimosa, hyacinth and... cannabis.
- Oh.
- There's a combination of rare oils, exotic flowers, herbs and Macedonian brawley... combined with... the ash, of course.
- Ah.
- The residue. Euphoric acid.
- Euphoric acid.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Centuries old, discovered by the Assyrians during the reign of Hammurabi.
- What is it?
- It's a psychic deinhibitor... a tranquilizer which conversely stimulates the libido... while giving the feeling of euphoria.
Combined with alcohol, it becomes a soporific.
It's obvious that someone's trying to discredit you... to embarrass you.
First the missing three minutes, and now this.
Yeah.
- But who?
- Someone in your own organization.
- Yeah, but why?
- That we'll have to find out.
How can I find out when my own organization is off-limits to me?
- It's not off-limits to me, sir.
- Now, wait a minute.
We're talking about a top-security complex. If you get caught...
I'll take care of it tonight, sir.
- Cooper?
- Yes, sir.
General Carter.
I believe we can expect a visit from Mr. Flint tonight.
Okay.
I'll need your identification papers, sir.
May I see those, please?
I'm sorry, sir.
This doesn't permit you in this area.
Eighty heartbeats per minute.
Must be Russian cosmonauts.
That's 80.
Let's pay our respects.
My deepest sympathy, sir.
Your friend Flint.
I'm sorry. The document disintegrator.
You killed him.
Mr. Cramden, I'm surprised at you.
He broke into a top-secret security complex.
There was no choice.
He did it because I...
I'm sorry, but you know the rules, sir.
Flint.
He was obstinate.
A loner.
But the greatest.
What are you doing?
Sorry, sir.
Yes, sir?
Huh? Who's this? Flint!
Flint! Where are you?
Huh? Don't trust anyone.
I got it. I got it.
Flint, I gotta see you.
W- Where? Moscow?
Why Moscow?
Flint!
He hung up.
He's alive! He's going to Moscow!
Well, if he's alive, sir, who's this?
Oh, who cares?
I've gotta get the president.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
I was afraid you'd have thought
I cracked up.
Who could explain those missing three minutes?
And you felt that Flint could help unravel the problem.
He seemed my last hope, sir.
And after he broke into security last night, he told you that we were infiltrated with traitors?
Yes, sir.
Did he mention any names?
No, sir, but I believe him.
That's why I thought you should know, sir.
I wanna thank you, Lloyd.
I want to confess that I misjudged Flint.
- Where is he now?
- Uh, Moscow.
What's he doing in Moscow?
Derek, darling, what are you doing in Moskova?
The usual thing, my love.
When can I see you?
Tonight.
Where?
The usual place.
- Derek, darling.
- Yes.
Your American music is so decadent.
- Yeah.
- Mmm, but it's so exciting.
Well, that's where it's at, honey.
Champagne.
Mmm, champagne. Pazhalsta.
A good year, huh?
I've been saving it for your regular visit.
Mmm!
Tonight.
Derek, darling, you haven't told me why you are here.
It has to do with a couple of lady cosmonauts.
Lady cosmonauts?
Now, how would I know about lady cosmonauts?
I read the cardiographs from the space platform.
And, uh, what makes you think these are women?
The male heart beats
72 times per minute.
The female, 80.
- And these were 80?
- Yes.
Derek, you are right.
There are two missing.
This is important, Natasha.
Can you tell me about it?
I will tell you all I know.
Oh, Natasha...
Don't you move.
It's the same ingredients.
Of course. It was in the paper!
Agave Americana.
It's indigenous to the Virgin Islands.
Virgin Islands?
Virgin Islands.
Fabulous Face?
It's in the Virgin Islands, right?
The missing cosmonauts...
What is it, Natasha?
What are you into? What is it?
Derek, darling, I am not your enemy.
I am your friend. I can't tell you now because it's too late.
- Well, tell me anyway.
- You will be very happy, but first, darling, you must make me happy.
Who are you? What are you doing here?
My apologies, comrade Natasha, but the order comes from the prime minister himself.
He wishes to see Mr. Flint.
At 4:30 in the morning?
He couldn't sleep.
Your performance was so magnificent.
He wishes to confer upon you the Nijinksy Medal.
Oh.
- Is this your coat?
- Yes.
Ivan, help Mr. Flint on with his coat.
Soon.
No, no!
Now! You too!
Hoo-hoo.
Hoo-hoo!
Hi, there!
Mr. President...
Melvin, listen!
If you haven't got our two lady cosmonauts,
who has?
Melvin, I've got to find those girls.
Be reasonable.
They could be where?
Melvin, bite your tongue. They couldn't live there three days. They hate rice.
Melvin.
Melvin, you give me the girls.
Melvin,
I will make a deal with you.
All right. You say you haven't got the girls.
But just in case, we got Flint.
"Who?" Flint!
Yes, Flint!
What? Kill him?
But he's your number one hero.
Well, Melvin, I was exaggerating.
We don't actually have him, but we know where he is going.
The Virgin Islands.
Melvin, you know we got no flights there. Only to Cuba.
Melvin, what would Flint want in Cuba?
Senora, para usted.
Para los pilotos.
Gracias. Gracias.
¿Como esta, pilotos?
Para usted y usted.
¡Que bueno!
Es de Havana. Mmm, muy bueno.
What's going on?
I mention Flint is in Moscow, the president can hardly wait to get rid of me.
People I've never even heard of are placed in key positions, new faces everywhere.
Even the date of my hearing postponed.
I tell you, if Flint is right... and we've been infiltrated, we're in real danger.
I'm being electrocuted.
If you'll stop talking, sir,
I believe I can pry it out.
- Take it easy.
- I think I've got it, sir.
A transmitter.
They've known every move we've made.
But who's doing it, sir?
I don't know.
But I was right, and so was Flint.
How do we trace them?
I think I can find a way, sir.
This device operates on the same principle as a walkie-talkie.
The system can be reversed.
Paper clip, sir.
This transmitting device can become a receiver.
Just a few moments, sir.
Yeah.
I think this should do it.
General Carter?
General Carter?
General Carter? General Carter?
General Carter here.
What is it, Lieutenant?
Sir, this orders me to load the rocket with nuclear bombs... instead of a weather laboratory.
Nuclear bombs, sir?
- That's right, Lieutenant. Project Damocles.
- Project Damocles?
- Arming the space laboratory, sir?
- That's correct.
The code name is Damocles. New orders directly from the White House.
This is top security.
You understand, Lieutenant?
Yes, sir.
Proceed with arming immediately.
Arming the space platform.
You realize the consequences, Avery?
Yes, sir.
A nuclear threat to the world.
And he said the orders came from the White House.
We know better than that.
General Carter is the traitor.
We've got to stop him.
General Carter's got the president brainwashed.
If we could just get to Flint.
Yeah.
Why, we can!
He was gonna meet his girls.
That's it, Avery!
Some beauty resort... with a silly name in the Virgin Islands.
- "Fabulous Face. "
- Virgin Islands?
But that's where...
The missile site.
Coincidence?
- Avery, you get to the missile site.
- Yes, sir.
And you, sir?
I'm going to Fabulous Face.
I haven't always been a desk-bound commando.
And Flint... he's not the only master of disguise.
Tovarisch. Tovarisch.
Do-svidanya.
Adios.
You're doing fine, dearie.
- I'd better take these upstairs.
- Why?
There's something wrong with these girls.
Well, not much that I can see.
Hmm, yes. Well, maybe the machines are out of whack.
Just these three? Uh-uh.
These girls have got resistance.
We're just not reaching them.
You know that Flint, he must make quite an impression.
Hmm.
Well, I'd better take these upstairs.
They'll know what to do.
- Mind the store?
- Okay.
- What's the trouble?
- I can't explain it.
These girls have rejected all our programming.
This Mr. Flint of theirs...
Yes. Yes, he's quite an influence.
As a matter of fact, he's on his way here right now, and we must get them out of sight.
Welcome to Fabulous Face, Mrs. Hiller.
Oh, I'll take the bags. Thank you.
Your room is ready.
Will you follow me, please?
I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay here at Fabulous Face.
Come along now, dear.
Just take your time.
That's just fine.
Uh, this way, dear.
Get a load of this one.
Oh.
What's that?
That's what I call ambition.
Good morning.
- Mr. President.
- Yes, madam?
M... Oh!
Lloyd!
Of course.
The golf course.
The missing three minutes.
Lloyd, what's going on? Why am I here?
- We'll take care of that.
- There. Isn't that better?
Just one more session, and we're through for the day.
Well, I hope at least this one will be cool.
Oh, you'll just love it. Mm-hmm.
That's a cryobiology lab!
- Oh, no!
You're not putting me in there!
Let me go! No!
Let me go! Oh, please, no!
- You're not putting me in there!
- Oh, yes, dear.
I hated to do that. They're nice.
What a pity they're so hard to convince.
It's that Flint of theirs.
He must be a hypnotist or something.
Does it ever make you wonder when you see how girls like that feel?
Forget it.
Penthouse, please.
Hello, Mr. Flint.
Miss Norton.
I imagine you find it all a bit... Gothic?
It's lovely.
What you must think of us... to come in this way, unannounced.
But not unexpected, I gather.
No. Is this real?
- Cryobiology?
- Yes.
Oh, yes. Yes, it's quite real.
We call it our "save for later" program.
- No!
- Yes.
Here, people worth keeping can be saved for a time more worth living in.
As a matter of fact, it's really quite the ultimate luxury.
- Hmm.
- Just imagine.
Just imagine.
Here we can suspend time for as long as we wish... to return 50 or a hundred years later.
Well... to be frozen in nitrogen gas... and then thawed out at some time later like a supermarket pizza... is not exactly the classical idea of immortality, but...
Now, those... Occupied?
- Oh, yes.
- Who?
But-But come along, Mr. Flint.
This, uh, really isn't much of a welcome.
I'd like to give you a tour.
I'm sure our ladies... would like to get a good look at the famous Derek Flint.
Oh, you're very flattering.
Good evening, Mr. Flint.
Good evening, Mr. Flint.
- May I?
- Thank you.
Oh, sorry.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Excuse me.
You're quite accustomed to being admired by women, aren't you?
- Hmm.
- All those, uh, ridiculous...
Sighs? Yes, you're quite right.
They are ridiculous.
I must say it's refreshing... to be with a beautiful woman who's above that sort of thing.
Why, I never said I was above that sort of thing.
What I meant was, uh...
Yes?
You really are good at it, Mr. Flint.
Tell me something.
What is it about you that makes you so irresistible to women?
It's very simple.
I don't compete with them.
Now that ends the suspense.
You're quite right. I was curious.
Well, now you've had the tour, and so have I.
It's getting late, Mr. Flint.
Shall I have them take you to the airport now?
- No. I want to see the girls.
- The girls?
- Where are they?
- They left this morning.
Look, I just came from Moscow.
I had a talk with a little ballerina named Natasha.
There are two cosmonauts up there, and my girls are here.
There's a connection. What is it?
- Cosmonauts?
- Mm-hmm.
Ballerinas?
I think we should take him to the office.
Lead on, ladies.
Now, let's not have that media discussion all over again.
The announcement has to be on television the same time everywhere.
Understood?
Do you mind?
Come along, Mr. Flint.
Ladies, this, of course, is Derek Flint.
- Miss Elisabeth.
- Miss Elisabeth.
- Miss Simone.
- Miss Simone.
- And Miss Helena.
- Miss Helena.
I know all of you ladies.
Fashions, cosmetics, publications, communications.
You're all very famous ladies.
What you don't manage, you control.
What you don't control, you influence.
What you don't influence, you probably one day will inherit, hmm?
That's very well put,
Mr. Flynn... uh, Mr. Flint.
- Don't you agree, ladies?
- Indeed.
All silo personnel stand by. Ready for missile loading.
Excellent. Excellent.
Well, I must say that this is quite a sight for a mere man... to be present here among all of you.
This, uh, summit conference of brains and beauty, all sitting here watching a rocket being prepared.
Now, what could that mean?
Uh... those Russian ladies flying arou...
You're in control of the space platform?
He's really very clever.
Mr. Flint, you're really quite intelligent for a man.
Yes, yes. But it's getting late, and there's still a great deal to be done.
Run along, Mr. Flint. All your questions will be answered tomorrow.
As soon as Project Damocles is complete, we shall return.
- Project Damocles?
- Project Damocles.
The Project Damocles that calls for nuclear energy to be used as a threat?
Correct.
That's a totally discredited idea.
No one in his right mind could...
Miss Elisabeth, we can't let him leave here now.
No, my dear. You're quite right.
Don't be so nervous, Mr. Flint.
There's nothing to worry about.
By this time tomorrow, women will be running the world.
And then you will see how quickly everything will settle down.
Women running the world?
Oh, you can't... You can't be serious.
- Why not, Mr. Flint?
- Yes, why not?
Oh, come now, Mr. Flint.
How many businesses... are actually being run by secretaries, mistresses, wives?
If the boss goes away for a few days, does the work stop?
- No, of course not.
- That's probably true, but I can't imagine...
You can't imagine how we poor, dear ladies can cope with it all?
Face it, Mr. Flint.
We women are outliving you.
The wealth of this country, of the world, is concentrated in our dishpan hands.
In the laboratories, our reflexes are quicker than yours, our manual dexterity
20 percent higher... and our patience a damn sight longer.
All right. Granted all of that.
Now, what's your hurry?
Why don't you just wait?
It'll all fall right into your laps.
Uh, you will still have laps when you're all wearing the pants, I assume.
But what about the millions of women throughout the world... who may not see your little plan just the way you do?
- Did you say millions?
- Millions, yes.
My dear, show Mr. Flint how the hair dryer works.
Go ahead, Mr. Flint.
I think you'll be quite interested.
Hair dryer?
I suppose when the hair is wet, the current is conducted and the programming received.
Brain and hair washing at the same time.
Exactly.
You really think you can get away with this?
Get away with it?
Oh, Mr. Flint, think a minute. Think.
Now then, hair dryers like these have been in use for some time, correct?
Yes, correct.
Very well. For many years now, every time a woman went into a beauty shop, she came out a little bit more dissatisfied with a man's world.
We've been busy, Mr. Flint.
I think you'll find the contented housewife... is a thing of the past.
Ladies.
Forget it!
Forget it?
General Carter, what is the meaning of this?
Why aren't you and Sebastian getting the flight ready? You know your orders.
Shut up and sit down, Your Highness.
Playtime is over.
Sit. Major.
Well, Mr. Flint, I bet you've been getting an earful of this nonsense too.
- Well...
- Well, forget it.
The situation is well in hand. My hand.
Did you really think we were gonna go through all that just for you old broads?
- Broads?
- Come on now, did you?
But Sebastian believed in us. And so did you and the girls on the platform.
- Sebastian, the actor?
- The best.
- What's he playing?
- The president.
- The president?
- Yes. He took you all in, didn't he?
You know something?
He's really enjoying the role.
So much so, we're going to make the whole thing permanent.
All this time, the years we spent in planning...
He couldn't have fooled us.
He was so sincere about our cause.
Oh, yes, he was sincere.
But that's before we saw the view from the top.
An actor as president?
Oh, we were fools to trust any man!
I hate to break this up, but I've got to be there when the balloon goes up.
- Yes, of course.
- Major, escort Mr. Flint personally to the cooler.
- The cooler?
- Yes.
You'll see your friends there in a minute.
Take the ladies down.
Shall we try diplomacy?
You've kept everyone waiting, Mr. Flint.
Take your hands off me, you monster! How dare you!
Since there aren't enough freezers to go around, you two will just have to double up.
I've seen to it that you have a lovely companion, Mr. Flint.
You're so kind.
How much time do we have?
We have less than an hour.
Sir, a call from you?
There's an air base close by.
Who'd believe me?
Well, I saw a lot of floating stuff up there, and your staff, I understand, is quite athletic.
- I don't know what you mean.
- I do.
Look, Miss Elisabeth, our way just didn't work.
I'll get the rest of the girls, and I'll meet you at the beach.
- What will you do when you get there?
- Operation Smooch.
Operation Smooch?
Operation Smooch?
Smooch.
I've been expecting you, sir.
Mr. President, Mr. Flint, if you'll follow me, please.
Come this way, ladies.
Gentlemen. Gentlemen, we are rapidly approaching... what we hope will be the most momentous launch of the century.
I'm sure you'll join with me in wishing both of our astronauts...
- What the hell is going on here?
- I don't know.
Guards!
- It's the president!
- No, that's the president.
Now, you all know me.
You've known me for years!
That man is an impostor.
He's right. I was not elected to this office.
However, there are certain compelling reasons... why I feel I should continue in it.
And I'm sure that
General Carter agrees with me.
Oh, yes, sir.
You take charge here, sir.
I'll see the bird flies right.
Countdown will continue.
Pick up the count, soldier.
11 minutes.
Don't be disturbed, gentlemen.
I assure you that our relations with your governments... will continue as before.
- In fact, with possibly fewer disagreements.
Verify that missile checks are complete...
and auxiliary checkout kit readout is compatible.
Well, Doctor, how are they?
They're in excellent condition, General.
- Excellent.
- Good.
The president asked me personally to offer his best.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.
- Have a good trip.
: eight minutes. Mark.
Verify that Mod llI guidance data link test is complete.
Verify flight dynamics auxiliary sustainer cutoff test is complete.
seven minutes.
- Ladies.
- Mark.
- Hello, baby.
- You don't need your gun, honey.
But I can't. I'm married.
I'm married.
What the hell is this?
Sadie Hawkins Day?
Cut it out. Cut it out!
I...
Cut it out.
That is a presidential order.
I order you to... You!
I order you all to cut it out!
Stop the countdown!
Do you know what you just did?
You cannot manhandle me.
That is a treasonable offense.
Get Carter down here, quick!
- Don't touch me!
- Mr. President...
Don't touch me!
Calling General Carter.
Calling General Carter.
Calling General Carter.
Calling General Carter.
Calling General Carter.
Calling General Carter.
Nuclear alert!
This is General Carter.
As you know, this lever controls the arming of ten megatons.
Enough power to destroy the entire Caribbean area, with a radiation fallout that could cover half the world.
I know you don't want me to do that, so think about it.
But don't take too long.
Sir, we've got to get the people out of here.
- If we delay...
- Stall him! I'll go after him.
Flint, wa...
But, sir, you better stop him.
Lloyd, you've gotta stop Carter.
This is Lloyd Cramden.
What is it you want?
Start the countdown immediately.
You're not gonna pull that lever.
You'd go up with the rest of us.
That's right.
Carter, wait! We can make a deal.
We've got Trent.
Congratulations. Now he's your problem.
Carter! Carter, listen to me!
Come on, Cramden.
You're stalling.
You've got to stop him.
General Carter, this is your acting commander-in-chief.
I order you to leave that capsule at once!
"Acting" is right.
But you're out of the cast now.
Your understudy has taken over.
Stop stalling, Cramden.
Get going. Don't waste any more time on that clown.
Clown? Do you realize who you're talking to?
I am the commander-in-chief of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force!
I call on all loyal Americans to picket the White House!
Write to your congressmen!
Don't let them fluoridate your water!
I am deposed!
"Oh, for God's sake, let us sit upon the ground...
"and tell sad stories of the death of kings.
"Once more into the breach, dear friends.
Once more into the breach. "
Carter, the countdown will begin.
Good.
Just remember. I don't want to see... any deliberate malfunctions appear on these instruments.
So be reasonable.
Start the countdown.
Uh, get me Mission Control.
I'm gonna need that suit.
Mission Control, give me Cramden.
Mr. Cramden, it's the ready room, sir. Mr. Flint.
Flint? Yes?
Lloyd, get me three minutes, any way you can. Three minutes.
Right.
He's in the ready room.
Get him three minutes any way you can.
Yes, sir. You, you've got a malfunction in the tank pressure stabilization.
Move!
Reporting malfunction in tank pressurization stabilizer.
We're checking it out.
- Good luck, sir.
- Thank you, gentlemen.
Propulsion officer checking out tank pressurization malfunction.
You're stalling! There's nothing wrong.
I'll give you ten more seconds.
There's no other choice.
Yes, sir.
Resume the countdown.
Yes, sir. minus ten seconds.
Nine, eight...
Hatch open, and all systems are go. Pre-ignition.
Five...
Why, it's Mr. Flint.
That's Flint!
- Ignition!
- Zero.
See ya!
What about the interceptor missiles?
If we detonate in the atmosphere, we've had it... the whole hemisphere.
We can't let them arm that space platform.
The timing will be critical.
We'll have to wait till the last second.
- All right, have the missiles readied.
- Yes, sir.
What about Flint?
We're committed.
- Send them up.
- Yes, sir.
Fire one.
Confirming visual observation of liftoff.
Report time of launch vehicle liftoff.
Second stage separated and clear.
Capsule entering orbital path.
Unable to regain monitor contact.
We can't communicate with the capsule.
We can't reach him, sir.
Sir, there's something wrong with the capsule.
The guidance control system has malfunctioned, and the capsule is off course.
It's heading into deep space.
Hold those interceptors.
It's too late, sir.
Two seconds.
He'll not be forgotten, Lloyd.
There will be a national... no, an international day of mourning for him.
I'll issue a proclamation.
Mission Control. Control Center.
Control Center, awaiting instructions.
It's Flint!
He's alive!
Hooray! Hooray!
- He must be on the platform!
- That's impossible!
Of course it is!
That's why he's Flint!
Congratulations, Flint.
You made it!
We'll get you back here safely.
We've got a recovery team in the area of the Canary Islands.
Sorry, sir, but the Canary Islands seems a bit far out to me.
I... would appreciate splashdown instructions... for, say, Central Park.
Central...
Get the coordinates of Central Park.
Flint, what's going on up there?
I'm with a couple of friends.
Now, Flint, listen to me!
You're no astronaut. You're in danger!
Well, ladies, it was touch and go, but I hope you learned your lesson.
The world is better off in our hands.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Mm-hmm.
Flint, are you all right? Say something!
Flint, are you all right?
Say something!
If you're not single or courting
When our hearts mingle in space
That face
I don't believe it is grace
Combined with evil in such a zowie way
I'll maybe steal a little guile from you
I should run a mile from you
But I'd sooner stay
If we could only be left alone
In a lonely place
It would be dreamy and if I'm disgraced
I could know your zowie-zowie face
WeII, there it is, darl. Bulinga.
Just another town.
Can't tell it from 20 others we've passed through in six months.
Best part is when you come to them for the first time, like now.
They're all different somehow.
You mean like some have six pubs and others have a dozen?
No, that ain't what l mean.
The trouble with you, lda, is you got no imagination. l got an aching backside, that's my trouble. l know all about that backside. lt only aches when you're losing an argument.
Let's go, Sam.
- Good night, Mum.
- Good night, dear. ls that all the money we got left?
Yeah.
And keep your hands off it.
Got a hole in my sock.
All right.
Leave it out where l can find it.
Aren't you gonna wash tonight? l washed this morning.
Admiring yourself?
Magnificent specimen, ain't l?
Oh, l don't know. Downright puny compared to some l've seen.
You know something, lde?
You're built the way a woman ought to be built.
- Just find it out?
- No, l noticed it a couple times before. lt just came home to me today, when we were passing through Cooma...
...seeing all them sheilas.
Broomsticks, that's what they are.
Nothing to hang on to.
Did you try?
Now, you know better than that. l was just looking.
- And comparing, eh?
- That's right.
Looking, comparing, thinking what a lucky bloke l am.
Oh, glad to know you appreciate me.
Come on over here, l'll appreciate you.
Want another cuppa?
There's still some in the billy.
No.
Sean, get that saddle on Sam, will you?
Well, come on, get a move on you.
Look at that farm, Dad. Ain't it a beaut? lt's nice.
Oh, it's all right.
Bit on the small side.
And how many acres do you own,
Mr. Carmody?
All of Australia, that's what l own.
The rivers, the plains, all of it.
Do you suppose the poor coot on that farm can just come and go like we do?
- Well, maybe he don't want to.
- He can't. He's stuck.
He don't sleep for fear his cows will run dry...
...or else he don't sleep because he's up milking them.
Breaks his back painting the place and watches the sun peel it off.
Worries about droughts, and when the drought breaks...
...he's got floods to worry about.
- You do have troubles, don't you?
Why, you've just gone through more in the last 10 seconds...
...than most farmers go through in 10 years.
Do you think those cow cockies have an easy time of it?
Nobody has an easy time of it.
How do you know that bloke don't lie awake...
...worrying about the mortgage?
Do l do that?
Well, if you did, you'd be the first man ever mortgaged a tent.
Oh, you're a card, lde.
You're a real card. l don't know why the pictures didn't take you instead of Buster Keaton.
Well, l'll be home for dinner.
Darl, if you get the job...
...what you gonna do about an extra horse?
Well, l thought about taking on another drover.
Be sure and get someone we can live with.
We're gonna be stuck with him for two or three months.
A clean-living teetotaler, that's what l'll hire.
Well, you can try a little teetotaling yourself, while you're at it. lt's all right, ain't it? lt's what home looks like, when you have a home.
Reckon l'll go bag us a couple of rabbits.
Head towards town.
See if you can find your dad.
He ought to have been back long ago.
He's either celebrating getting the job or drowning his disappointment.
Come on, Ollie.
Get off me!
Get lost!
Ollie! Ollie, let go!
Hey, mister, that's my dog.
Get off!
Get this moronic whelp off me before l beat his brains out.
Don't hit him.
Hit him with that, and l'll shoot you.
- Get off.
- Ollie, let go.
All right, fearless, lower your blunderbuss.
Well, l don't know if you've got a father...
...but you're obviously a piece of true-blue British stock.
- My father's lrish.
- Oh, is he? l'm sorry. l'm sorry about the dog.
He just don't seem to like people. l am not people, boy.
You must teach him to be more discriminating.
This your place?
Never mind that.
Where'd you spring from?
My old man's a drover.
We're here after a job moving sheep. l mean, my dad's after it.
But where he goes, we all go.
Mr. Venneker!
- Yes.
- l want to talk to you, Mr. Venneker. lndeed. Yes. The widow McDonald.
- ls she your boss?
- My employer...
...which is a vastly different thing.
- Mr. Venneker?
- Yes.
- You'll be back for dinner tonight...
...won't you?
- Well, l'll try. l can't... l'm doing roast beef and Yorkshire pudding for you.
Are you, indeed? Oh, there you are, yes.
Many's the man who sunk to his doom in Yorkshire pudding.
- Pardon?
- Pay a woman a compliment...
...she tries to turn it into a contract.
Well, may l offer you a lift into town?
Yes, please.
Well, l must say, l find you less repellant than most people your age.
Giddap, giddap.
- Well, there we are.
- He must've got the job.
Thank you, boy.
Thanks, Mr. Venneker.
Hey, Sean. Hey, that's my boy.
Hi, boy.
Right-o, Dad. How about you and me going home now?
Don't wanna spoil the concert, do you?
What's the rush, anyway? l got the job.
Good-o. Did you hire a drover?
You were gonna get a bloke with horses, remember?
You worry too much, Sean. lt's a sad thing, kid like you worrying. l'll tell you what.
You run along home and leave everything in your old man's hands, all right?
How about more from Paddy?
Now, look here. l simply cannot concentrate on any drinking...
...with this intolerable noise going on.
Stop it!
Hello, boy. What's the matter?
You lost your father?
My old man's got the job, and he's feeling too good to quit.
- That's him singing.
- ls it? l'm very sorry to hear that.
He has the most disagreeable voice, doesn't he?
- Well, he likes it.
- Does he?
Now, what's he weigh?
- Thirteen and a half.
- Thirteen and a half?
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen?
Why? l wouldn't disturb him while he's singing.
Hold my beer, will you?
Oh, no. Not again. Boy!
Ollie, let go.
Get off. Get off!
Come on, hurry up.
Boy, get this man-eating mongrel off me.
Get off. Get off.
Get off. Get off.
Hey, you know that English coot?
The remittance man.
The one whose old man's a lord or something.
He's having a blue with some fella.
Good on him.
Can you see anyone with our beer?
Get off!
Get off.
Ollie, will you quit it?
Let the law through. lt's old Venneker. He's drunk.
No, he's not.
He's being attacked by a dog.
- A mad dog?
- Mad dog?
- Mad dog.
- Mad dog.
- Mad dog?
- Mad dog.
Look out, he leaning. l was bitten by a mad dog once.
Oh, God, l was crook.
They wouldn't let me have any beer for a whole month.
Paddy.
Paddy!
When are we supposed to pick up the sheep?
What's the flaming rush, lde?
Since when do we...?
Conscientious bloke, that drover you hired last night.
Got here before sunup.
So there you are, Carmody.
Hale and chipper for the job ahead?
Ain't it cracker,
Mr. Venneker coming with us, Dad?
Sean, you got the wagon packed?
- l'm gonna put Mr. Venneker's stuff in.
- Hang on.
Look, mate...
...l was a bit shickered last night.
You looked like something sculptured from the sediment of a beer vat.
Never mind about that.
The point is, l don't need a drover.
Well, where'd you get that idea?
You make less sense sober than drunk, Carmody.
- You got 1200 head of sheep to move.
- l've moved bigger mobs on my own.
You're not on your own. lf you insist on riding that dejected beast of yours, who's gonna pull the wagon?
- The good woman there?
- l shouldn't be surprised.
Right-o.
Look, what's the sense talking? l couldn't pay you anyway.
Oh, well, money is not my problem.
You can pay me when we get to Cawndilla. lde, what the devil's he gotta come with us for?
You hired me. ln any case, l've been here long enough.
Most places are fit only for arrivals and departures. l like to do them both as often as possible.
- Could be you talking.
- l knew we'd end up soul mates.
- l'm thinking of chucking up the job.
- No, you're not.
- lde, you stay out of this.
- Speak for yourself.
Do you mind if l handle it? lf we have to live in a tent, l say we keep moving.
That way, we've got an excuse for not having a home. l'm sick of other people's sympathy.
And that's what we always get if we stay too long near any one town.
We're taking those sheep to Cawndilla, no matter what.
And Mr. Venneker and his horses are going with us. l'm sorry, Carmody. l didn't mean to precipitate that.
- Right-o, we'll take you.
- Yes.
And your horses.
That's 1200 sheep. Deliver them to Cawndilla in six weeks...
...the bloke at the other end will pay you a shilling a head.
- Goodbye. Good luck.
- Thank you.
Do me a favor, will you? lf you're gonna be a drover, look like a drover.
Get rid of that silly, flaming hat.
Let me tell you about this silly, flaming hat, my good man.
And don't call me that. l'm not your good man.
- What do you prefer? Boss?
- Wouldn't be a bad idea.
This cap belonged to a ship's master in the China trade.
Oh, what happened to him?
Nothing happened to him. He's just not gonna call you boss, that's all.
Got a passenger for you. Here.
Good. Thanks, Dad.
Rupe, why do you talk to your horses?
Don't you know it's very rude to listen to other people's conversations?
Sorry. l never thought of horses as people.
Let's hope you never have to.
Are you a real duke?
Shut up, boy.
Dad told me you'd been a ship's captain in China.
Oh, yes. l had occasion to tell him that.
What's China like?
Very full.
Just as Australia's very empty.
Why did you leave?
My stomach. l was a notoriously bad sailor.
Dad said you must've been a better sailor than you are a horseman.
What the devil's he talking about? l was cashiered from the 17th Lancers...
...before he knew one end of a horse from the other.
Not that he does now.
What does "cashiered" mean?
A kind of promotion, from the army into civilian life.
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.
Go to sleep now.
- l'd love to go to China.
- What about the farm? l want that more than anything.
Want a bit of everything, like me.
- Because you're young.
- But you're not, though. l'm younger than l seem to you. l've never really grown up, you see.
And you've never had time.
That's why we're out here instead of in a comfortable tent, like your parents.
- Rupe...
- No more questions.
You're still growing upwards. l'm only growing sideways now.
Apart from that, we have a great deal in common.
Come on, Sam. Giddap, there.
Come on, giddap.
Hey, Dad, look, a dingo.
- Where?
- Over there, Mum.
Just like a dingo.
Too big a coward to come out in the open and have a go.
He'll catch a couple of sheep tonight and kill them just for the fun of it.
Not if l get him first, he won't.
Get him, Dad!
Missed him.
Nice bit of riding, all the same.
Come on, giddap, Sam.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- Be all right to spill the mob here?
- You can use that paddock there.
But don't let them stray into the other one. Me grass is thin enough now.
Yeah, looks a bit dry.
You been having a rough trot?
Terrible. No rain now for 10 months.
- Good day.
- Good day.
- We're the Batemans.
- Hello.
- We're the Carmodys.
- How you doing?
- This here's...
- Rupert Venneker. Afternoon, ladies.
English. l ain't had a man take off his hat off to me...
...since the day Ern first met me.
Oh, thank you very much. lf you'll excuse me... Sheep.
Why don't you came in for a cuppa? lt'd be welcomed, but l ought to start dinner.
How'd you like to cook it on a regular stove?
- How did you know?
- Ern used to be a drover. l broke my back bending over too many campfires.
My name's Kylie.
Come on.
Here we are. lda, the way you cook, l'll never hear the last of this.
Yeah, she'll do me, Paddy. l'm thinking about keeping her.
Oh, l'm a champion woodchopper too. l get plenty of practice.
Ern, how long you been here?
Started eight years ago with only the land.
- Things was pretty crook for a while.
- You should've stuck with droving.
No worries a horse can't take you away from.
- Stay put, that's my motto.
- Well, it's different with us.
- lda likes to move about, don't you?
- Oh, you'll hear if l don't.
Of course, it might be different when the girls marry.
Mum, can l take my scraps down to Ollie?
- Oh, yes, dear.
- Excuse me, missus. l've got plenty of scraps for Ollie too.
Well, all right.
His mother got me the same way.
Darl.
After Cawndilla, where are we going?
Oh, l don't know.
What difference does it make?
What's the matter, darl?
Can't you sleep? l was thinking about Sean.
He really wants us to settle down, get a place of our own.
You saw the way he looked around here today. lt's like that with every farm we pass.
He's never stopped talking about the one in Bulinga. lde, he wouldn't wanna be a blooming farmer, would he?
Oh, he might. lt's natural for him to want a home.
He's not all you, remember?
No, but he thinks like me. Anyway, he's not old enough to leave school yet.
What school?
He's been going to school and l didn't know it?
He went to school in Jindabyne.
And that six weeks at Broken Hill.
What about the time...?
Oh, imagine all that schooling.
- He must be ready for the university.
- He can read and write, can't he?
He wouldn't be able to do that if l hadn't taught him. lde, you're getting me all mixed up.
Now, where was l?
Sean was getting ready to leave school.
We'll have to get him a new suit for that occasion.
Well, if you're just gonna be funny about it...
Oh, no, no, no. Go on. You're the boss.
Right.
Well, l was gonna say, all this talk about settling down...
...he could forget about that tomorrow.
You know how kids are.
You mean, because he feels so comfortable...
...bouncing his guts out in the wagon, sleeping on the ground...
...and eating dust with his food and never getting to know anyone but us?
No, l mean because he's a kid, and kids change their mind every 10 minutes.
Six months from now, he might even wanna be a tram conductor.
And what if six months from now, he still wants a place?
Well, that's when we'll talk about it, then.
Right now, we better try and get some sleep.
Anyway, we ain't got enough money for a fence post, let alone a farm.
How much will we have in six months? l thought l smelled smoke.
Well, my nose is too full of dust to smell anything.
There's a fire on that ridge over there.
Well, that ridge is over two miles away.
Two miles ain't anything if it's a crown fire. lt can go through the treetops faster than a horse can run.
Everything underneath it, trees, scrub, air, the lot, just goes up in flames.
- l see.
- Better get the mob on the run.
Fire. You better get a move on, quick.
Oh, it's coming this way.
There's a river two miles on.
Get to the other side, you'll be all right.
You hop down, Sean. We'll need you.
Don't go risking your life for the sheep, now.
- See you the other side of the river.
- Come on. lt's a crown fire.
Get up to the head of the mob.
You can make a break for it if you have to.
Tell Sean to get after lda.
Get back to your mother, Sean.
Your dad says so.
- But what about...?
- Go on. Cut through there.
Move, boy, move. Go on.
Mum.
Mum! Mum!
- Dad told me to come ahead.
- But what about him and Mr. Venneker?
They'll be all right.
He knows what he's doing. l hope so.
Come on, Sam, giddap!
Giddap!
Hey, the mob's breaking up. l've got to turn them back.
Paddy, come back!
Paddy!
Paddy!
Paddy!
Paddy!
Paddy!
Whoa, back, Sam! Whoa, back!
Whoa, back. Whoa, back! lt's swinging away from us.
We're all right.
We're not all right.
Your dad's still in there.
Where's Paddy? Where's Paddy?
Mum! Mum!
Paddy.
Oh, Paddy.
Well, here it is, lde.
What is it, darl?
Nothing, really.
Giddap, Sam.
Lord love a duck, a woman.
Been waiting long? l've been having a bash at the piano.
You should've come sooner, you would've heard me singing. l've got a voice like a foghorn, but l enjoy myself. l don't think life's worth living unless you enjoy yourself, eh?
Now, where are you from? You look as though you've come a long way.
What are your names?
Oh, never mind, we can sign that later.
- How long you gonna be here?
- Just the night.
We're off to Queensland in the morning.
We come over from Bulinga.
Our name's Carmody.
Oh, Bulinga? l don't know where that is.
My word, you are lucky, all this traveling. l've always wanted to travel. l came from Port Augusta for a week...
...about 15 years ago, and l've never been back since.
Have they missed you?
Ain't he a joker? With a beard too. l bet that scratches the girls, eh, love?
- Now then, what can l do to help?
- Well, we'd like a bath.
Too right, too right. Plenty of hot water.
Now, who's going first?
Or is it all in together, this cold weather?
Now, follow me.
Nothing like a good hot bath.
Weakens the men and strengthens the women.
Ought to be the other way around.
Now, come on, Mrs. Carmody. l'll take you and sonny first. l'll get the baggage, all right, Mum?
Carmody, do you think that creature is planning to give us our baths? l've got lda to protect me.
But l'd watch my step if l was you.
Especially if you're gonna stick around for a while.
Oh, yes. This is the end of the line, isn't it?
Hey, that's right.
This is where we split up.
Rupe, aren't you moving with us?
No. l only signed on to come this far,
Sean. Job's finished.
Yeah, l suppose you're right.
- Come on, Carmody. l'll buy you a drink.
- No, let me buy you a drink.
You know, Rupe, sometimes you make my teeth ache...
...but there's worse than you.
Now that we're parting, Carmody, the drinks are on me.
Look, don't start another flaming argument on me. lt's my show!
Look, Mum.
Shearers coming from all over Australia to make money...
...and here we are, turning our backs on it. lf we stay here, maybe l could get a job.
You're old enough to be a tar-boy. lf you and your dad both work as a team...
...we could make quite a little nest egg to put in the jam jar.
Just in case we ever decided to settle.
Settle? You mean, get a place?
Our own place?
But what about Dad?
He said that if in six months, you still wanted it, we'd talk about it...
...and that was quite a while back.
- Did he mean it?
No. But he'll have to talk about it if we've got the money and still want it.
- l do want it.
- Then that just leaves getting the money.
Well done, if l say so, who sings it better alone.
There's nothing like a sing-song to get the dust out of your lungs.
- How you going? All right?
- Very well.
How about a dance? lda, can you play?
Oh, l haven't played for years. l suppose l can try.
Good-o.
No, no, no.
No prancing. No, no.
Oh, that's more exhausting than track.
Rupe, we'd like you to come to Queensland with us.
Now, what do you say? l say, you'll hate yourself in the morning.
But l think l'll linger a while...
...and investigate the possibilities of Cawndilla.
Paddy, do you think he means me? l've never had such a good time. l say, lda, why don't you stay here a while?
No, no, no. One night will do us.
We're the restless type, ain't we, lde?
Looks that way, doesn't it?
Where are you going, Sean?
- l don't know. To bed, l suppose.
- No one can blame you.
Nothing's so revolting to the young as the sight of their elders at play.
You get a good night's rest, Sean.
Gotta get an early start in the morning.
- Good night, son.
- Good night, Mum.
But think what we could do with the money.
We could fix up the wagon, get new gear, buy an extra horse.
You think Sam isn't tired?
You think poor old Sam doesn't need a bit of a rest?
First it's Sean, then it's you, and now it's Sam l gotta do all this for.
What about Ollie? ls he mad for me to be shearing sheep too?
Mr. Venneker's coming with us after all.
That's nice. What are you doing here? l didn't investigate the possibilities of Cawndilla, after all.
Things got very serious after you left the party and... l'm an old fish, Carmody.
- l know the hook when l see it.
- You ain't going back to her? l probably will, eventually.
She's an awfully pleasant person. l flatter myself l created a rather good impression on her.
Pity to waste it.
Shall we join the shearers?
Good day. You the shearing boss?
Yeah. Quinlan's the name.
Looks like you got your team all filled up already, eh?
Pretty near.
- How good are you?
- Just fair. l ain't done it a while.
He doesn't like to boast, but he can do better than 200 sheep a day.
- His best is 248.
- Yeah.
Mister, you got yourself a job.
Hold on there. Not so fast.
We're sticking together. lt's all or none.
My kid wants to be a tar-boy.
Well, that's easy enough.
What about him? He don't look like shearing no sheep, does he?
He's quite right, actually. lf l have to break my back, l'd rather do it by some more merciful method. l reckon that puts the kibosh on it.
No point in wasting Mr. Quinlan's time.
Now, look, just a minute.
We've still got an opening for a cook and a wool roller.
How do either of them strike you?
The roller's job is gone to Mr. Venneker.
That leaves me.
How about me for the cook?
Just a minute, darl.
You never cooked for a...
That queers it. l never use a woman cook.
Right-o, if the missus ain't good enough for you, neither am l.
Come on, love.
Hold your horses.
As union representative of this team, l gotta remind you of the rules. lt's the men who choose the cook, not the boss.
Bluey, use your head, man.
They've gotta have a cook they can abuse if the tucker's not up to scratch.
That tucker will be up to scratch, all right. lf that's them, why don't you ask them?
All right. Hey, you blokes, come on over here, will you?
Come on, move it.
There's a lady here looking for a job as cook.
Now, it's up to you blokes, like the union rep says.
As far as l'm concerned, the vote's no.
A wool shed's no place for a woman. l won't be in the wool shed, l'll be in the kitchen.
Been a long time since l had a meal cooked by a woman.
- Be a nice change.
- l'm not worried about the food, missus.
But there's rough language that goes on in the shed.
Some might shock you, you know what l mean?
- You wouldn't be able to stand it, love.
- l've stood your language for 16 years. lf she can cook as good as my missus, l'm for her. l'm for giving the lady a chance.
Well, yeah. Let's try her out.
All we can get is indigestion.
Sean!
That boy of mine is real keen to get started.
He'll do. lt's that husband of yours who don't seem too keen.
You haven't got a worry.
He's as happy as a lark.
What the...?
All New South bloody Wales to drive in, and you gotta aim at us!
Didn't you hear me blow me horn?
What's blowing your horn got to do with it?
- We had the right of way!
- Right of way? Go...
Right-o. You're in the wrong, and that's all there is to it.
- Come on. Shake a leg.
- You wanna pull your head in.
- Herbie was in the right.
- Who asked you to put your oar in...?
Like to make a small wager on who's gonna get...?
Hey! Get back!
Right-o, everybody. All aboard.
The war's over.
- Get up.
- All aboard!
Well, l must've drew Jack Dempsey. l was going up and down like a lavatory seat.
Ocker, it was you what got us into that donnybrook.
- Good on him. Had the time of me life.
- Looked like you done some pro fighting. l was up for the middleweight title back in '01.
Got put in me back in the ninth.
Too much unwatered beer.
- l remember you. You're Turk Tuthill.
- l was all right.
Just wasn't good enough to be champ. l'd say Paddy's missus was champ today. l never seen anyone break up a fight so quick.
You got a real good sort there, Paddy.
Yeah.
Anyone know how to spell
"obstetrician"? l'll tell you how if you tell us why.
Because l'm gonna have a baby.
- Did you hear that?
- Good on you, boy.
- Why, you little beauty.
- You'll do me for a dadda.
What do you want, Bluey, a boy or a girl?
Make it a girl. They never have to work as hard as us poor mugs.
Why don't you stop laughing? lf it is a boy, you gonna bring him up to be a shearer?
Oh, no, no.
No, he's gonna be a cricketer.
The best bat since Victor Trumper.
He's gonna play for Australia like l wanted to but never did.
Neither will he, because he's gonna be a she. l'm never wrong.
Ocker, why don't you shut your big, sour trap? l hope he's good enough, Bluey.
Oh, he'll be good enough, l'll see to that.
All he's gotta do is be born a boy.
- What's amusing you?
- Gee, it's gonna be fun.
This is the first time l was ever away from home.
With your mom and dad not 50 yards outside that window.
You call that being away from home?
Being out in the world's a state of mind, not of geography.
Distance between that tent and this bunkhouse...
...is the longest journey you'll ever make in your life.
Anybody hollers for a bucket of dip, you bring it, see?
You can't go wrong, short of getting counted for a sheep.
Here comes the brains.
All right, men!
Hold on. Want him to think you hear him?
You gotta keep the bosses in their places.
This is the boss, Mr. Halstead.
Good day, men. l want you to work fast, but careful, right?
All right.
Get ready, now.
Who is it?
Good morning. l'm Jean Halstead.
Oh, the boss's wife. Come in. l'm lda Carmody. l thought l'd drop in and see if there's anything you need.
As a matter of fact, there is.
Would the boss go for me getting a little oilcloth...
...to edge the shelves and windows? l don't see why not.
Sorry it's such a dreary place for you to work in. lt's the first kitchen l've been able to call my own since l left home...
...and that's a long time ago.
To me, it's heaven.
Well, come on, sit down, have a cuppa with me. l just made a fresh pot. l'll bet you didn't get that dress in Cawndilla.
You remind me of a society girl who gets their picture in the Sydney papers. l used to be one before l got married.
Thought l'd changed by now.
Oh, aged? Not so as it shows.
You don't even look married. l don't feel it most of the time.
Oh, living way out here must be a big change...
...from what you're used to.
How do you like it? l'm trying to.
Bob loves the place so...
...and he worries about my not belonging.
The real trouble is, l've nothing to do.
Sorry. l don't usually spill over like that.
Don't be silly.
You get starved for another woman to talk to sometimes. l know.
This is a good country for sheep, and it's not bad for men...
...but it's hard on us women.
The men come here for the sheep.
We come here for the men...
...and most of us finish up looking like the sheep.
Wrinkled faces, knotty hair, not even much of a mind of our own. l think you'd always have a mind of your own, Mrs. Carmody.
You sure you have time for a chat with all those men to cook for? lt's their aching backs they'll be worrying about tonight, not their stomachs.
First day's hard on them, but it's a blessing for the cook.
Well, l hope you're satisfied, you and Sean.
And Sam. Mustn't forget about Sam.
Shut up. You're worse than Ocker.
Why don't you give yourself a chance to like it? l don't see how you can like it, cooking for a mob of no-hopers.
Working your fingers to the bone. l'm having a real good time. l got room to put things and a chair to sit on...
...and another woman around if l want a bit of a gossip.
She's a nice little piece, not too happy either.
That Halstead probably gives her a rough time of it.
No, just the opposite.
Keeps her wrapped in cotton wool.
Women don't like that, you know.
Educate me, darl.
Tell me what women do like.
All right.
No, no, no. Around here, we do everything by the bell.
Get up by the bell, go to sleep by the bell, eat by the bell...
...wash by the bell.
We ain't got a bell for that, lde.
Oh, what's the use?
Welcome back, Rupe.
What would you like? l'd like a schooner of beer, among other things. lda, we have a visitor.
Oh, just a wild guess...
...but would you be Liz Brown,
Bluey's wife?
She's been traveling three days and nights.
You took an awful risk.
- Might've had the baby on the train.
- l don't care. l want to be with Bluey.
And l don't care how angry he is either.
Oh, come on in and sit down.
You're all tired out.
- Sean, hurry up and get Liz a cuppa.
- All right.
There. Give me these, that's it. l know the men aren't supposed to bring their wives.
- Do you think they'll let me stay?
- Well, l don't know. lt's up to the boss, really.
What do you think, Jean?
Well, l don't see why she shouldn't.
There's lots of room up at the house.
And after all, it's my house too.
You wait here, Liz, and don't worry.
You powder your nose after you've had your cuppa. l'm gonna go and get your old man.
Sean here will keep you company.
He's a special friend of Bluey's.
Thank you. l must look awful.
No, no, honest. You look good. l mean, no worse than a sheep does before...
You're not gonna have the baby now, are you?
No. l wouldn't dream of doing such a thing to a special friend of Bluey's.
Liz! Liz! Liz!
Liz.
There's one doctor in Cawndilla.
He covers 500 miles, so he's never there. l just hope you women know what you're doing.
We ought to, we've been having babies long enough.
Tar-boy missing. Shearer missing.
All the men carrying on like a bunch of school kids.
What sort of way is this to run a shed?
- Oh, shut up!
- Oh, shut up!
- Morning, Mum.
- Morning, dear.
There's a letter for you from the Batemans.
- Bluey.
- Thanks.
Hey, listen to this, fellas. lt's from a mate of mine in Melbourne.
He puts five quid on a horse and wins 200.
And here l am playing barber to a mob of greasy sheep.
You're doing all right out of greasy sheep. We all are. l'm halfway to paying off me radio shop. l hate to say it, but Bluey's right.
One more season, and l'll own the neatest pub you've ever seen.
A cheerful place that will be.
Come on, you blokes. Let's go!
- Oh, come on. What's the matter with...?
- Back to the torture chamber.
Come on.
Gotta get this thing going.
- Made it again.
- Good on you, missus.
Hey, wasn't that the starting bell?
They can start without me. l'm gonna have a cuppa tea with my missus.
Well, good on you.
You know, we haven't said 10 words to each other all week? l know.
What about going to town on Saturday night?
You know, have a few drinks, talk.
What do you say?
Oh, l'd love it, Paddy.
Tell you what.
You let me have half a quid out of the jam jar...
...l'll treat you like a bloke with his first girl.
Ten shillings? Oh, l don't know.
Oh, come on, lde. l break me back for you.
Let me have a bit of fun.
Right-o. Saturday night it is, eh?
Spending the night in Cawndilla?
Would a cup of hot, strong tea be possible?
A few more visits to Mrs. Firth and you're gonna end up married. l've paid many visits to many Mrs. Firths all my life...
...and l'm still free.
- lt's all a question of technique.
- Yeah.
But let's leave my problems and consider yours.
Your good man seemed almost cheerful.
No, not really.
This job's got him down worse than l expected.
Well, he's a man who hates routine.
What he need is a little excitement.
But where's he gonna get it?
Barring some sheep turning round and shearing him.
Tea's up.
Time for a smoko, mate.
Right-o, let's stretch the spine for a bit.
Gentlemen, l have a sudden yen for some nice, clean, easy money.
- Do you wanna start a two-up game?
- We'd only take money from each other.
What we want is to take it from someone else.
What are you talking about? ln this shed, we have a gun shearer who's among the fastest l've ever seen.
- Paddy.
- Exactly.
A shearing contest.
Well, l ain't no flaming world's champion, you know.
Didn't say you were, but let's have none of this hanging back.
Can't stand false modesty.
Well, if you blokes wanna risk your money on me, l'll give it a burl.
Hey, Paddy!
Saturday night, and you're just standing around?
Shearers ain't what they used to be.
Quinlan's taking us all in to Cawndilla.
We're going to fix up a shearing contest with the Mulgrue mob.
- They're bound to be in town.
- Come on in with us. l promised the missus l'd take her out.
She'd kill me if l welshed.
That's how it is when a bloke's married.
Can't call his soul his own.
- l tell you.
- You tell him, Ocker.
What about you, Sean?
You off to the pictures?
Rupe's taking me to a play, with live actors.
Not very live probably, it's just a small touring company.
- Don't start tearing it down in advance.
- No, it's a fine night, stars are shining.
My missus is all dolled up for me.
Let's not anybody start tearing anything down.
Should have a tie, really.
What's the matter, darl?
You ain't dressed.
Paddy. Paddy, l can't go.
Liz is pretty close. l just can't take a chance and leave her.
Why can't Bluey sit with her?
- What about the Halsteads?
- None of them know what to do.
Besides, she wants Bluey to go out and have a good time. l've been looking forward to this all week long.
You think l haven't?
But you can understand, can't you?
Well, l suppose so.
Look, why don't we just forget about going to town?
We go down by the tent and build a fire, sit around and talk.
Pretend we're back on the track again.
We'll save ourselves 10 bob.
Well, you see, Liz asked if she could bring her knitting over...
...and sit with me, company-like. l thought you were going out with the men...
What'd you have to do that for, lde?
You didn't ask me about it.
- Hey, Bluey! What are you doing?
- Blue! Hey!
Come on, Bluey!
Thanks, lde.
Hey, come on, Paddy.
Paddy, l wish you'd go along and have a few beers. l'd feel better.
Besides, l need you to go to see that Bluey gets back early...
...and not too drunk. Will you?
Right. Hey, Quinlan, wait for me!
Hey, Bluey, what are you gonna call this girl of yours when she's born?
Ocker, l told you a dozen times, it's gonna be a boy.
- That's right, ain't it, Paddy?
- Anything you say, Bluey.
Hey, Bluey. You ain't drinking too much, are you?
- Oh, no.
- Right-o.
Why do you say this man of yours can beat any shearer we got? ls that just a figure of speech, or do you have in mind, for example, money? l got in mind, for example, 20 quid.
Beside what the rest of the blokes in my team have in their minds, you follow?
When we was mixing it by the trucks that day...
...l couldn't help but notice you kept leading with your right, like this:
No offense, but that's why l smeared you.
- My right's where l pack my punch.
- And where you leave yourself open.
Now, why don't you try something like this:
- See?
- Like this, you mean?
- Watch it, Turk!
- Careful, mate!
See what l mean?
Friends, Romans, shearers.
Hello, Sean. How did you like the play?
Oh, don't question him, madame.
Don't waken him from his dream.
He fell in love with the leading lady.
- Honest truth, give a bloke a go.
- Oh, no shame in that.
When l was your age, l was head over heels in love with Lily Langtry.
And now, my mulga-scrub lily, l'm head over heels in love with you.
Oh, no.
Hey, Sean.
Oh, hello, Dad. Didn't see you.
What are you doing all by yourself? l like being by myself, except for you, of course.
My own family.
Your mother wouldn't come with me.
Should've taken you.
But l was going to the play with Rupe.
That's what l mean.
All my family seems to be spending their time with somebody else.
Madame, the memory of...
The memory of your bell-like laughter keeps calling me back.
Oh, Rupe. Those duke's daughters must miss you.
The duke's daughters. They haven't heard half the things l want to say.
- Can't we go?
- Oh, l can't leave the till, Rupe. Not yet.
Well, have l come to this?
A cash register as a rival?
Gert. l'm back, Gert.
How's the cold you had in your chest?
Matter of fact, how's your chest?
- You miss me while l was gone?
- Certainly not.
- Who the devil's this, Gert?
- Hello, Jack. This here's Rupe Venneker.
Rupe, this is Jack Patchogue, mayor of Cawndilla.
He's a sort of friend.
- Pleased to meet you, Venneker.
- Patchogue.
"Sort of friend"?
Gert, what's been going on here?
Now, you pull your head in, Jack.
What l do with my spare time is my own affair.
- Now, listen to me.
- Yes, you do that, Your Worship.
And l'll be next door warming the cockles of my heart...
...for you-know-who.
You're gonna die laughing at him, Jack.
And you should've heard the words.
When you think it's the same language, you say, "Pass the salt in"...
- You just can't understand how they...
- Sean.
Sean, have a beer.
- What?
- Have a beer.
You went to the play with Rupe because that's what he likes.
Now have a beer with me because that's what l like.
All right.
Here, love, small beer.
Just wish Mum could see me now.
Now, where is the doctor?
But he must have said when he'd be back, l... l'm sorry l yelled, but please, send him over the minute he gets in.
The doctor's at the Jameson place,
20 miles from here.
You think you might catch him before he leaves? l can have a go.
- What will we do?
- Be a welcoming committee.
That baby's on its way, doctor or no doctor.
Well, l better help Liz get into bed.
Mrs. Carmody, l don't want Jean to be frightened.
Well, you think we should let Liz have that baby alone?
Give Jean credit, Mr. Halstead.
She's a strong girl.
She'll do what she has to do.
Right. Try Mrs. Firth's pub, see if our mob's there. lf not, try every pub in town.
They're bound to be in one of them.
Nobody home.
There's nobody home but me.
And l'm in terrible hurry.
We played lots of tennis at school and did a lot of surfing.
Sydney's lovely in the summer.
Couldn't find him. lda, l feel crook.
- Starting to hurt quite a lot.
- Not for nothing, Liz. l'll try to be good.
Don't. You scream the house down if it helps. lf she doesn't, l probably will.
- lda, how long were you with Sean?
- lt's different every time, you know.
Bluey. l want Bluey.
- Hang on, Liz.
- l want Bluey with me.
- You'll be all right, Liz.
- Bluey.
- l'll get him.
- What? l'll go into town, find him, and bring him back.
All right, but don't be long.
Hello. What are you doing here,
Mrs. Halstead? l'm looking for Bluey.
- Hello, love.
- Have you seen Bluey Brown?
Where is he, l said?
Oh, get away from me.
Oh, here he... Bluey? Here he is, love.
Right over here.
Look at him. Full as a goog. lt's just that after-hours drinking.
Well, sober him up and be quick about it.
Liz wants him.
Oh, hey. Hey, Bluey! Hey.
Hey, Bluey.
- You're having a baby.
- l know that. lt's lambing time at Wattle Run!
- l'll lay a quid it's a boy!
- Neither one, it's twins!
Come on! Come on, you!
- l'll lay a quid it's a boy!
- Neither one, it's twins!
Come on, you blokes! l'm driving! l couldn't get the doc.
He's gone out to Big Billabong.
Bob, l must go and help lda.
See that the men get Bluey sobered up.
Well, here he is, lde.
All in one piece, and almost as good as new.
Shut up, all of you!
Well, stone the flaming crows, if it ain't old lde.
Good on you, lde!
Well, thanks for all your kind help!
Now then, get him sobered up. l don't care how you do it, but do it quick.
What am l, his flaming keeper or something?
Hello, Mum. l saw my first play and had my first beer tonight.
Aren't you his keeper either? lda, hurry.
Come on now, Liz. Push.
That's it. Now harder. Come on.
There's a girl.
Here, Jean. Let her pull on your hands.
Well, here he is, what's left of him.
The rest is down the hill.
Well, he looks shrunk, but human. lda. Oh, lda, l feel crook.
No, you don't, Bluey.
Go on in and say hello to your son.
Oh, l gotta tell the fellas.
Well, this is the first baby born on Wattle Run that isn't a sheep.
Won't be the last, l hope.
What are you two talking about?
- Morning.
- You're up early.
Well, l needed something to do.
- l told Turk to tell you...
- Yes, yes, he told me. Thanks.
Didn't want you to worry.
- All right, look...
- Paddy.
Before you say anything, l...
- l'm sorry about last night.
- lt's all right. l'm sorry about Sean, for that matter. l don't know what l was thinking about.
- lt was just one beer, lde.
- Well, won't kill him, eh?
Everything all right, then?
Yeah.
Only...
...l'm turning in my time tomorrow.
We're leaving Saturday night, right after work.
We've been here six weeks, lde.
You needed a change, you said.
All right.
Well, ain't six weeks long enough?
Listen, lde. Everything's going wrong between us since we've been here.
We never see Sean anymore.
We never see each other.
When we do, we're dead tired or there's a hundred strangers hanging around. lt isn't staying l care about, it's the money we're making.
We don't need the money.
We've never needed it.
We need it now. l want a home, Paddy, just like Sean does. l don't want to ride that wagon right into my grave.
Oh, what good does it do turning away every time l say it? l told you in the beginning, l couldn't get stuck in one place. l had to keep on the move.
You kept on saying it was all right.
Now, what'd you wanna lie for? l never promised l wouldn't change. l never promised l wouldn't get older and scared.
What do you mean? You think l can't take care of you and the kid?
We're both getting older. lt's time we...
- Don't talk for me. l'm not finished yet.
- l'm just trying to look ahead, Paddy.
Well, l'm not looking past Saturday.
That's when l'm gonna go.
You and Sean don't wanna come with me?
Well, don't.
Hey, Paddy.
Wait a minute, will you?
Everything's right for the contest with the Mulgrue bunch. lt's okay with the boss too, so we fixed it for Saturday.
- We're depending on you.
- l don't want nobody depending on me.
- You better get somebody else.
- Stone the crows.
You heard us make the plans last night. You didn't stop us. l was drunk last night. l ain't gonna split a gut just so l can say l'm faster than some other bloke.
That dirty dingo.
A man ought to knock his head off.
He could have his reasons.
Oh, blast his reasons.
He's backing out like a yellow dog.
How we gonna look, going over to Mulgrue's, telling him it's all off?
Oh, maybe we're better off this way.
A dingo like that, he'd probably throw his hand in halfway through the contest.
Dad just told the men he wouldn't be in the contest...
...after letting them set it up for next Saturday.
He wants us to leave next Saturday.
Then how will we ever get enough money for a place?
He doesn't care about a place.
He's going whether we go with him or not...
...and that's how strong he feels about it, Sean.
- But we never split up before.
- And we're not gonna split up now. l'm gonna stay, Mum.
And l think you ought to stay too.
Sean, you've got your whole life to live.
We're halfway through ours, your dad and me.
There are other people waiting for you...
...but there's no one waiting for us except each other.
Don't ever ask me to choose between you and your dad...
...because l'll choose him every time.
Good day.
Mum says you're leaving Saturday. l got me own reasons, Sean.
You're too young to understand. l get sick of being told l'm too young, like it's a disease or something. l told Rupe there'd be no sense talking to you.
What right have you got going over our business with him?
He was sticking up for you. He didn't think you were a dingo, like Clint said. l'll fix that Clint later.
The minute you turn your back, people go around talking about you.
There's not one of them game enough to say it to me face. l think you're a dingo for running out on Mum and me.
Don't hit me, Dad, or you can leave and l'll never come after you.
Don't ever talk like that to me again, Sean. l might have killed you.
You're not gonna leave, are you, Dad?
Please don't.
- Hey, Paddy, can we see you?
- Just a minute. lt's the men. All of them, Dad. l know, Sean. l feel crook about it, but...
Well, they just can't back down. lf there was only some way...
Yeah?
We have a new plan, Carmody.
- What plan?
- A plan for the competition.
We want the Mulgrues to see that we have a man in whom we're proud.
Cut it out, will you?
But the main object is to raise money for a worthy cause.
Christening present for Bluey's baby.
Well, crikey. Why didn't you say so? l didn't know it was anything like that.
Doesn't mean we can't bet on the side.
We can still make a pile of money.
As long as Bluey's nipper gets a big piece of it...
...l'll be only too happy to give it a go.
You beaut, Dad.
Hey, let us in on the secret. lt's the shearing contest. lt's all set up for next Saturday.
Well, now. l come over to give you all an invite to a party in honor of Bluey's baby.
But it seems to me as though he's gonna have to share it...
...with Paddy, the people's choice.
Right-o, boys. Next Sunday at the pub, beer, saveloys and sausage rolls.
Come on, Rupe. Walk me to the car.
How does that bloke do it? lde, l was thinking...
...since l have to stay here for the contest anyway...
...might as well stay to the end of the season.
Well, how about a cuppa?
You haven't had a bite all day, have you?
Too right.
- You hungry?
- No, l'll have an earbash with the boys.
See you later.
Carmody, there isn't a living soul in Wattle Run who hasn't bet on you.
Even a couple sheep have been trying to get a word with me. l just hope this Mulgrue mob's brought enough money. l'm not guaranteeing anything.
None of that. No modesty. lt's confidence gonna win the day. lt is? Well, that's good. l was afraid it was gonna be me.
Hey, here comes the Mulgrue mob.
Johnson. Are you the challenger? l don't know why they picked me, l'm the worst man we got. l ain't counting any chickens, Herb.
Don't rush it, Carmody.
Just keep a nice, steady pace.
Two hundred and ninety should be enough to win. l've heard bull in me time, but that takes some beating.
Well, if you're gonna do it, let's do it.
You're here, stand number four.
Here, Wilson.
Keep your eye on those, will you?
You gonna unscrew your wooden leg?
No, we don't want to embarrass the champ.
They must be off their rockers, that Mulgrue bunch.
- He's 80 if he's a day.
- Paddy'll make a monkey out of him. l wouldn't wanna show him up, anything like that. lt wouldn't be right.
Hey, Clint, lay a fiver for me, will you?
- You're on, mate.
- Just win, Dad.
We got a quid on you,
Mum and me. Good luck.
The contestants will work in two-hour stretches...
...with five-minute rests and one hour for a meal.
The score will be kept jointly by our Mr. Quinlan...
...and Mr. Wilson of Mulgrue's.
May the best man win.
- Stand by.
- Come on. Hey.
Go for your quota, Paddy.
You won't get any compo if you collapse, Herbie.
That little runt couldn't bag a hussy.
Work from the hip, Carmody.
Now, easy follow-through.
Follow through with that instrument, come on.
- How does he look?
- Fresh as a babe.
You've been flat out like a lizard drinking, but he's been with you all the way. lt's shocking.
That cove ain't human.
Try not to show him that you're nervous. ln fact, it might be good psychology if you could manage a hearty laugh.
You laugh. l can't think of anything funny.
- We could tickle you.
- Don't worry, Dad. He can't keep it up.
- That ain't what l'm worried about.
- Paddy, his legs'll give out.
- You got a long way to go yet.
- That's what l'm worried about.
Stand by.
Break for lunch.
That little old weasel.
- What l'd give to have money on him.
- Ocker!
Do you practice being a louse or does it just come natural?
Dad, you've got an hour.
- Go and lie down. l'll bring your...
- No, he mustn't. lt'd give Johnson an immense psychological advantage...
...to know that
Paddy's lying flat on his back.
He hasn't even come outside.
Has it occurred to you that he may be too exhausted even to reach the door? l'm gonna go lie down in the tent.
- Paddy...
- Rupe.
We may be neck and neck in the shearing...
...but psychologically, he's got me licked.
- Ten for Johnny Sanford.
- Ten for Johnny Sanford.
- Two for Willis Jacobs.
- Right, two for Jacobs.
Ten for Costello. Four for Pierce.
All right, four for Pierce.
And a tenner for you, Wilson.
Do you want that now, Wilson?
Bluey. l'm sorry l didn't win for your little nipper, Bluey.
Don't worry about it, Paddy.
You did your best.
And three for Sandy Sanderson, and that's the lot.
Well, good day. l've enjoyed meself.
Thanks for asking us.
Poor Dad.
Just when he was feeling cheerful.
He'll stay cheerful, once we're on the move again.
- Sean, remember that farm in Bulinga?
- Remember it?
Whenever we talk about a place, that's the one l'm thinking of. lt's still for sale.
Mrs. Bateman wrote me. l didn't wanna tell you about it before. l suppose those farms don't get sold very quick.
- Did she say how much it costs?
- Two thousand pounds.
At the end of the season, we'll have better than 400.
That's enough for a down payment.
That's if Dad wanted a place.
First we'll get the money, then we'll worry about Dad.
Speaking of Dad, this doesn't seem tactful, somehow.
Quiet.
Quiet!
Quiet!
Right-o, who's for peeling potatoes?
Hey, fellas!
Listen, there's a room outside with sawdust on the floor.
How is it for a game of two-up? l've got a feeling it's us for peeling potatoes.
Woman's instinct, l call that.
Well, go on, booby.
Come on, girls.
Where are all those big betters?
Are we all here? l'm for five.
- Here's five quid to say l can head them.
- l'll set the center.
- l'll bet he heads them.
- Thirty bob.
- A pound he heads them.
- A pound he tails them.
Two bob he tails them!
- Yes, l'll set you.
- Right.
- You all set on the side?
- Yeah.
Right-o, come in, spinner.
Now, fair go.
Up they go, and it's a head up.
And it's... tails! l won. You should've bet the same as me, Dad.
- Son, you see, l only had a quid left...
- l'll bet the ten.
Excuse me, Dad.
Don't wanna miss the next toss.
Four bob, he tails them.
Four pounds, head.
Serving beer on Sundays and running a gambling joint? l could get 12 months in jail and lose me license.
Why don't you make them stop the game then?
Oh, let them have their fun.
They don't get much, the men out here.
They battle all their lives just to try and stay ahead of nature...
...keeping this part of the country alive.
And when they're dead, they're forgotten.
Nobody thanks them.
All they get is abuse.
Getting drunk on Sunday and gambling may be against the law...
...but the law was made by city wowsers.
They don't know nothing of what it takes to keep a man alive out here.
Beer, that's what it takes, Gert. Beer.
Well, it's not like you to leave a two-up game.
What happened, your luck run out?
Anybody home? l'm the owner. What'll it be, a room?
Yes, missus, and tucker, if you can manage.
Evan Evans, the name is.
Just delivered a mob of sheep. l'm a drover myself.
Paddy Carmody's my name.
- You're late in the season.
- Ran into a card game on the way.
Lasted a month.
Any place my sulky and horses can get shelter?
Here, l'll put them up for you.
Oh, in case you're interested, there's a two-up game going on in there.
- Where?
- All right, skinny, after you're fed.
"Skinny."
You know how much l won already?
Four quid. What's the matter, Dad?
You're not playing. l ain't got no money.
Which, if you had eyes, you could see for yourself.
Well, do you want a loan?
Take anything, Dad. Take it all.
A quid'll do me. A quid he tails them.
Come in, spinner!
- Tails, it is.
- Beauty.
You'll do me for a good luck charm.
Two quid he tails them again.
Fifteen years in a pub...
...and l still prefer a good cuppa tea to a bottle of beer.
Of course, l gotta get drunk now and then...
...to set an example to the customers.
More tea, lde? l'm going to miss the whole lot of you.
Just a couple of more weeks, isn't it?
Don't give me much time to work on Rupe.
Heads!
- A fiver on tails.
- You're on.
He's going again. He's going again.
Oh, come on. This is a party, and the food's ready.
- ls that all the money you got?
- Yeah.
- Another fiver he tails them.
- You're covered.
- Paddy's won 17 straight tosses.
- What?
- l loaned him money, changed his luck.
- All right, come in, spinner.
You got it, Paddy!
- How much has Paddy won?
- About 200 quid.
Sean, with what's left in the jar...
...that's almost enough for a down payment on the farm.
Well, what do you reckon?
You lost a packet already.
Don't worry about me, friend.
This is the air l breathe.
You've cleaned me out.
That's the way it goes. l'll tell you what, mate.
You put up that horse you got outside...
...l'll bet everything l've won tonight against him.
One toss of the pennies, what do you say?
What do l say when l won him in a poker game anyway?
You're on, friend. And l call tails.
Chilla, you ready?
Brother Carmody, you've got yourself a racehorse.
- Make more of him than l did.
- And the money, Mum.
And the money too.
Oh, you... You won!
Gee, Dad, ain't he wonderful to watch?
Ever since l was a kid...
...the thing l wanted most in the world was a horse like that.
You reckon you could ride him flat out and not fall off him?
Could l? You just watch me.
Go, Sean!
Come on, you little beauty! Let's have it!
Look at him go! You beauty!
Well, how is he?
Oh, darl, he's a beauty.
- What you gonna do with him?
- When we quit here...
...let's take him round to some of the small bush tracks, picnic races.
Everything works out, we'll head for a big race meeting.
Could we go back to Bulinga?
- They run a cup meeting and we...
- We could see Kylie Bateman?
No, Mum. That wasn't what l was thinking about.
Well, why not?
All right, we'll make it Bulinga...
...and we'll stop and talk to the Batemans on the way.
Got the makings of a real champion there, haven't we?
Yes, if he's looked after properly, and l shall see to it that he is.
Why, you know something about training horses? ls there anything he don't know about? l was brought up among horses,
English horses.
Epsom Downs was my second home.
Come on, come on.
What do you think this is, bush week? l wonder where the nearest race course is?
We could clean up a packet if Paddy'd race him.
Come on. You're like a lot of flaming old hens!
Can't you just see us, darl?
Still moving, going from track to track.
The Carmodys, not just drovers anymore, but racehorse owners.
Come down to earth. You'll be winning the Melbourne Cup next.
Well, why not?
Did you ever dream you'd have
200 quid in the kick...
...besides owning a racehorse?
- We'll have to name the brute.
Hey, that's right.
We could call him Dynamite.
Or what about Fireball?
Fireball? Grotesque.
No, no. Something classical would be more appropriate.
Wait. Why don't we call him
Sundowner?
Yeah, l like that.
Sundowner. What does that mean? l've been called that on occasion. l assumed it was a term of abuse.
No, that's the Australian word for people like us.
A sundowner is someone whose home is where the sun goes down. lt's the same as saying someone who doesn't have a home.
Quinlan's gonna sack you if this keeps up.
Old friend Quinlan is the least of my worries.
Care for a cuppa?
You're very chipper. ls it the prospect of wandering...
...from race course to race course which delights you?
Or Bulinga, with its farm for sale? lf Paddy knew what was in my mind, he'd be scared to death. l want him to look at the farm before he gets his back up.
Now, since this is nosy day at Wattle Run...
...what are you gonna do about Mrs. Firth?
Mrs. Firth? l'm going to say goodbye to Mrs. Firth.
She's a dear little body, isn't she? l just hope l don't hurt her feelings.
Don't you worry about her losing you.
She isn't losing one damned thing.
- lda, l thought you were my friend.
- l am your friend.
- l just don't like you much right now.
- l don't like myself very much.
Perhaps it would be better if l didn't accompany your family to Bulinga.
We'd be glad to have you, and you know it.
Though why you want to beats me.
Well, l'm a kind of elderly turtle, lda.
Hard shell, soft belly, wealth of experience.
Not much of a mind to make use of it.
Always in the soup.
No joke intended.
And this turtle can't share its shell with anyone.
But only when it finds people who really belong to each other...
...as Paddy and you do...
...it becomes attached, like a household pet.
Not a very well-trained one at that.
Oh, go on with you, Rupe.
Liz, you think the train trip will be too much?
Not nearly as much as all this saying goodbye.
Here.
Hopeless.
Hey, look at Ollie.
Three times now he's run back to the cook house. l don't think he wants to go. l don't feel so good meself.
Listen, Sean, there's something l wanna say. l just hope my kid turns out to be like you.
- Hey, Bluey.
- Yeah.
You hear the latest?
Ocker's thinking of getting married.
What's so funny about it? l've been engaged eight years trying to decide.
Speaking of getting married, l hope the great lover's getting an earful.
Now then, Rupe, we've had a lot of fun, and no harm done.
And why you're getting this hangdog look, l don't know.
All l want to say to you is...
...drop in again sometime, and take your chances.
Couldn't pin him down.
Not without breaking his leg.
Well, someone's gotta take the plunge.
- Hooroo.
- Hooroo, Turk.
Be seeing you.
Everybody for the track, in the truck.
Next stop, Big Billabong and another 50,000 wooly jumbucks.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
Come on, Sean! Come on!
Yes! Marvelous!
Look at the chest on him, huh?
What do you think of him, Ern? l'd swap the missus for him any day in the week.
He'll pay for that.
All the same, he's a real champ.
He'll stand a chance being a champ if we start at the Bulinga Cup.
You can camp right on the farm, lda.
Just drop in on the agent as you pass through Bulinga. l told him you would.
- What farm?
- Oh, the Owens' farm.
The one Sean and l were so keen on.
Annie wrote me it was still for sale. lt's a nice little place, Paddy.
You can grow anything on it. l didn't think there'd be any harm taking a look at it, darl.
Well, looks like l got the Sundowner just in time.
Otherwise you'd have me pinned under a mortgage...
...faster than you can say Bulinga.
But as you do have the Sundowner, why don't you camp at the farm?
Then he can have a good roll in the sand. lt'll fix up just lovely, a room like this. lt's the kitchen l wanna see.
Oh, my.
Hey, they even left two beds in one of the bedrooms.
Why don't we stay in the house tonight?
Because it don't belong to us.
Sean, run out and get my bag, will you?
Do you like the place? lt's a nice enough spread, all right, yeah.
What's a place like this cost?
Two thousand's the asking price for it.
Two thou...?
You ought to have your head read.
Now, why do you make yourself and Sean feel bad?
We ain't got money like that.
Yes, we have, Paddy.
We've got enough for a down payment. l thought maybe we could risk some tomorrow on Sundowner...
...to get us started with the farm.
You reckon he's a sure thing.
You know how l feel about settling.
Look, Paddy, you can't race Sundowner for the rest of your life. lf you stay here, you can put him out to stud.
Did you ever see a better place for raising horses?
Stay here, you could have the time of your life. lt's still getting stuck.
Rupe says he's off to the fleshpots of Bulinga.
What do you think, Dad?
Well, it makes sense, don't it?
Suppose l better say yes.
- Oh, Paddy.
- We'll see the agent in the morning.
Well, l guess l better get in town and get our bets down...
...before the odds shorten.
Yeah.
- How much?
- Fifty'll be all right.
Right. Well, see you later.
When'll you be back, darl?
Around sundown?
Soon as l can.
Did he mean it?
Yeah. Yes, he meant it.
Otherwise, he wouldn't have said it.
Well, he didn't seem too happy. lt's hard for him to get used to the idea.
He'll like it later, though. l bet he'll like it.
Of course he'll like it.
- Now can we stay in the house?
- l don't see why not.
Paddy?
Paddy? l've done something, lde. l lost the money. Two-up.
We still got the money in the jar. l wrote lOU's. l lost it all. l don't know what to say. l looked at you both, you and Sean.
You were just like strangers. l wanted you to have what you wanted...
...but God forgive me, l must've hated you both. l just wanted to get away from you, get drunk, get the taste out of me mouth.
That's all l meant to do, darl, was just get drunk.
That's all l meant to do. l'll make it up to you, darl. l promise you.
- l'll get you a place.
- No, no, no.
Don't talk about it.
Don't talk about it. lf it's of any use to you, l've got about a hundred pounds.
Oh, they'd never take that as a down payment.
Thanks, anyway.
Just by way of covering all the possibilities...
...you could sell Sundowner for a goodly sum.
Not before the race, you couldn't.
You'll need this to settle the lOU's.
Will we have enough to get us another job?
Well, there's 50 pounds prize money if Sundowner wins the race.
We better leave right after the race, then.
Come on!
Did he win?
He had to, darl. He just had to.
Wasn't he beaut? We had to go round the outside of him.
You'll be a better rider than l was.
- Two champions on that course today.
- And we won 200 quid.
We better collect our prize money, start looking for another job.
We're not going anywhere, darl. l made a deal with a bloke before the race.
Two hundred pounds for Sundowner if he wins.
That means we've got 400 quid.
We've still got enough for a down payment. l know what the horse means to you. l know what the farm means to you, lde.
You keep him.
Yeah, Owens' farm isn't the only farm in Australia.
When we've earned something, race him again...
...and make enough money for another place.
You know what l'm like when l've got a little money.
- l don't trust myself, lde.
- l trust you, darl.
We're not selling the horse.
Can't l do anything in my life without getting an argument from you?
- Mum, if Dad really wants to...
- Shut your gob.
This is between your dad and me, and it's settled.
- lda, you want a home, don't you?
- Oh, we'll have a home someday.
This way, if we do it, you'll hate every inch of the place. l don't wanna live with a martyr.
You're the only martyr to this family's got room for?
- You can stop being so damn noble.
- Who said anything about being...?
A protest has been entered in the last race!
Jockey Carmody, will you report to the steward's room? l'll bet on the fences.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...a change in the result of the last race!
A protest was lodged and upheld.
Number 17, The Sundowner...
...and number 8, Billabong, are disqualified for interference!
The winner is now Cassidy Sheila!
Well, you can't expect justice on a provincial course.
All right, where's the cow that squealed?
Who's running this race track, anyway, a mob of bush rangers?
Flaming robbers couldn't conduct a bazaar for...
Well, there goes both our chances to be noble.
Hey, Carmody.
He didn't do it so good, but l tell what. l'll give you 25 quid for him.
Oh, take off, friend.
The horse is not for sale.
- But a deal's a deal.
- She's the boss.
Come on, you two.
- Coming, Rupe?
- Coming.
Twenty-five quid?
Lucky for you, we've got a sense of humor.

Pati!
You monster.
Nuru, don't leave the drinks where Pati can get at them.
I'm very sorry, Memsahib. That bad, Pati!
It's not really her fault.
You're not supposed to put temptation in the path of an alcoholic.
She's not a.... She's a rock hyrax.
Yes, and a disgrace to her species.
Anyway, we'll all have to be more careful.
-I'm sure it can't be good for her.
-Yes, but she likes it.
I Know. Now, where did I leave my paints?
Here, Memsahib.
Thank you, Nuru. Will you take Pati?
Thank you.
Now, no more drinking.
I am Joy Adamson...
...and for many years my home has been in the northern province of Kenya...
...where my husband, George, was senior game warden.
One of his duties was to deal with dangerous animals...
...who were a menace to either human life or to crops.
And we were on safari in the Boran region...
...where a man-eating lion had been reported.
Look out!
You've been very successful, haven't you?
-Joy, can you spare a minute?
-Yes, I suppose so. What is it?
I've a little something for you.
-Do they belong to those two up there?
-Yes.
We had to kill the mother.
I'm sorry. She attacked us and we didn't know why until it was too late.
Poor little dears. Come here, darlings.
Careful!
One gave Sam a first-class scratch.
Not very good-tempered, are they?
Neither are you when you're hungry. l don't suppose you've fed them.
No, I can't say I have.
You didn't pack any lion's milk for me before I left.
You didn't ask me.
Come on, darlings, never mind that brute.
We'll feed you.
We'll make you strong and healthy.
Come on.
Well, that wasn't a great success, was it?
But why don't they? lt's at least two days since they've eaten.
-They'll just die.
-Yes, I Know.
It must be the formula.
We haven't hit on it yet.
-We'll just have to try again.
-Right.
Back to the drawing board. Formula....
Thirteen.
George, I've just been thinking about the cod-liver oil.
Do you think we put too much in?
Twenty-four hours Iater, they were still refusing food of any kind.
They were actuaIIy dying of starvation before our eyes.
Formula seventeen.
To be perfectly honest, I'm beginning to wish I hadn't brought them back.
Come on, darling. Come on, sweetie.
What is it?
What are we going to do with you?
Why won't you eat?
Don't you see you'll die?
Come on, baby, there's a little sweetie baby.
My little sweeties.
There.
There.
A little nap and they'll be begging for more.
Yes, thanks to Elsa.
Who?
-The one who took the milk first.
-Oh, yes.
-But why "Elsa"?
-I don't know.
Well, I suppose I do really.
She reminds me of a little girl
I knew at school.
She was the smallest of us all and not good at games...
...but she was bright and brave and good, and I liked her very much.
-Her name was Elsa.
-Fair enough.
You're wonderful, too, darling.
After all, you're the one that did it.
Why, sure.
They said I couldn't do it, but I did it.
Formula seventeen. You're a genius.
You really ought to put it on the market.
No.
You see, it would never work without one special ingredient. This.
I'm not putting that on the market.
Even as babies, each had a different character.
The largest one, we called her the "Big One"...
...was vain of her size and strength.
The second largest, Lastika, was the clown of the three.
But my favorite, of course, was the smallest, EIsa.
A weakling in size but the bravest of them all...
...she loved to expIore and investigate and examine.
And there were no limits to her curiosity.
In the wild, she would have been the throw-out of the pride...
...for the smallest cub in a Iitter rarely survives.
But Elsa had no inferiority complex.
AII the cubs were, naturally, housetrained...
...and always took great care to reach the sandboxes outside.
But, also naturally, there were a few accidents in the early days...
...and when these happened, they were most embarrassed.
Unfortunately for Pati, very soon the cubs were too Iarge for her.
At three months oId, their teeth were big enough for them to eat meat.
And this soon meant that poor Iittle Elsa never got her fair share.
So I kept the best bits for her.
George said he was convinced
Elsa thought I was her mother.
Whatever she thought, she made me happy by following me everywhere...
...and keeping me company whiIe George was away.
When they grew older and needed more room to play...
...we put Nuru in charge of them, and they got along beautifully.
...we put Nuru in charge of them, and they got along beautifully.
Elsa!
What are you doing? Go away!
Go! Get away!
Getting them out of their cage for their morning exercise was never a probIem.
Come on, babies.
But putting them to bed was another story.
Come back!
-Come back, Big One.
-Come on, Big One.
Come back, Elsa!
In you go!
Come on. That's it.
Come on. Inside.
And you. There!
Eventually, we had to ban them entireIy from the house.
To make it up to them, we hung an old tire from a tree...
...and Elsa particularly fell in Iove with it.
They're beginning to look like lions now.
Yes, and to behave like them, too.
Don't I remember the father was a man-eater?
You don't believe that man-eating is an inherited trait, do you?
I don't think anyone really knows.
I hope you're ready for lunch, 'cause I am.
And hungry enough to eat a hyena.
John's just wondering if your cubs might start eating people one day.
You're joking, of course.
You know my lions are perfect little angels.
Yes, but they'll be very large angels soon.
Isn't it about time you thought of shipping them off to a zoo?
Is that an order, John?
You're touchy. Have you been feeding him that lion's milk he's famous for?
Of course it's not an order.
But it's a good idea, isn't it?
Yes, of course, you're right.
We've already arranged to send them to Rotterdam Zoo.
-We're not ecstatic about it.
-Why? lt's excellent.
He means we're going to miss them.
I know I will, terribly.
Particularly one of them.
Of course you will.
They're absolutely loveable at this age.
-Forgot to shut the gates.
-Heaven help the house. Hurry!
Perfect little angels!
John, be a dear and get hold of Elsa.
-Be careful, she's not very strong.
-Neither am I.
No, you don't understand. She's delicate.
So am I. Let George fetch her.
Would you mind keeping your eye on her?
We'll be back in a moment.
All right, my delicate one. Here I come.
-Joy, would you go back and fetch Elsa?
-Yes. I hope John doesn't scare her.
Steady.
Elsa, you naughty girl.
Don't you understand? He's the boss.
I'm sorry, John, you must have frightened her.
Come on, come on, darling.
You mustn't be afraid of John.
He likes lions.
AII too soon, we received word from the Rotterdam Zoo...
...that it was ready to receive the cubs.
We padded and wired the truck.
And each day we took them out for a long ride...
...in order to prepare them for the 180-miIe trip to the Nairobi airfieId.
I wouId leave Pati behind on these rides.
She was getting old now, and I kept her as quiet as possibIe.
-Look after Pati for me, Nuru.
-Yes, Memsahib.
-All right, darling?
-Yes, fine.
-Memsahib. Pati....
-What's happened?
She's very sick, I think from heat.
I think she die.
She's dead.
When the day that I had been dreading came...
...I went for a last waIk with Elsa.
Elsa?
There you are. Come on.
Come on, come on down.
This way. Come on.
Elsa, no!
Come away. Please!
Thank you, darling. That's a good girl.
If it's any consolation,
I feel as rotten about it as you do.
George, I think I ought to tell you that just now Elsa....
What about her?
Nothing.
Come on, love. Come on.
There you go, my sweetie.
-l suppose we do have to send them off.
-Yes.
All of them?
Yes, even Elsa.
Even if I told you that she just stopped me from walking into a great big cobra...
...and that she knew what she was doing?
I'm sorry, it wasn't fair to ask.
Let's get the show on the road, as they say.
-Would you mind if I did some shopping?
-No, good idea.
-Can you cope?
-Yes, I think so.
I'll meet you outside Ahmed's.
-How will you get there?
-In a taxi.
I know it's silly.
I know she's not a human being.
I know she's just a lion, but I wish
I could stop feeling so miserable.
You will.
No, I'm just a fool.
I'm going to miss her terribly.
You won't, you know.
Elsa, sweetie.
Darling, thank you. Thank you very much.
-Hello, George!
-Hello, John.
Good afternoon, Bwana Kendall.
-Where's Elsa?
-Elsa's not out here today.
Good.
-How's Bwana George?
-Much better now.
But that malaria was very bad.
Good thing he has strong medicine.
Yes. Well, you don't look too bad.
I boxed with Nuru before breakfast, and earned a draw.
Good.
-Marvelous stuff, these malaria pills.
-Yes, if you don't overdo it.
I'm feeling fine.
Well enough for Joy to go out...
...and you Know she wouldn't go if I wasn't fit.
Quite. What's she up to?
Having the Land Rover checked.
And in case you're wondering,
Elsa's with her.
I don't understand why everyone assumes that Elsa and I have a feud.
-Help yourself.
-Thank you.
Actually, George,
I wanted to talk to you about another lion.
You know, the one that's been snatching all those goats down in Kiunga.
I don't see why you have to travel all that way in your condition.
Why don't I send Ken, or one of the others?
No, I think I'd like some sea air.
If you can wait until I feel a bit stronger.
I don't mind. A change would do you good.
But don't overdo it, will you?
The best cure for malaria is rest.
I take your point, John.
II'll rest. I promise you.
-Here, isn't that....
-Yes.
Come on, Elsa.
Come on down. Ride's over.
Hurry up. Let's go and see how George is.
Hello, John, how nice of you to drop in.
-Here's some letters for you.
-Thanks.
-How are you?
-Fine.
Good.
-Boxed six rounds with John this morning.
-Earned a draw.
How does it feel to live with the boxing champion of the world?
Marvelous. We boxed two rounds this morning and I knocked him out.
Can you stay to dinner?
Or, better still, stay the night.
-I can do both.
-Good. I'll just go and warn the cook.
Poor darling, I've hurt her feelings.
Joy!
Hello, Elsa. Have a nice drive?
-Stop it, Elsa.
-Hello, Elsa.
Get down.
Why don't you go and say hello to John?
You know, I think I'm being snubbed.
-Now stop it, Elsa.
-I hope.
You're getting heavy, Elsa.
Stop it, you're squashing me.
Now, the question is:
What have I forgotten?
Tell you what I've forgotten.
I'm almost out of malaria pills.
Right. Goodbye, darling.
Look after yourself. And no boxing.
I wouldn't dream of such a thing.
-Goodbye, John. Lovely to see you.
-Thank you.
Now I must say goodbye to Elsa.
Where is she?
On her car.
Elsa, I told you you couldn't go to Nairobi with me.
Have you met my wife who talks to lions?
Please, come down. Elsa.
-I'm afraid you'll have to help me, Father.
-Good old Dad.
Elsa, don't be such a lunatic. Get down!
Get down!
Come on!
Come on! Good girl.
Will you have another cup of coffee before you go off?
No, thank you.
What will you do with Elsa while you're away in Kiunga?
We'll take her with us...
...unless you care to board her till we get back.
No, thank you.
You know, you're as much her prisoner as she is yours.
She's not a prisoner. She's a friend.
Yes, I know.
And there's probably no harm in taking her on a short trip, with reasonable care.
But your long leave is due soon.
Are you planning on taking her to England for a year?
No, it's a problem.
I've meant to talk to Joy about it, but...
...I suppose I've been waiting.
Don't wait too long.
Look after yourself.
Come on, lunatic.
You're blocking the road.
John wants to go home.
All clear, John.
Thank you.
Now, look, Joy will be back tomorrow.
You can't stay here all night.
Damn it!
Now you've got me talking to you.
Look, she'll be back tomorrow.
I promise you.
Elsa, go away.
Don't you sneak up on me like that.
It's very unpleasant.
Elsa, get down, you idiot. l don't know.
Stop playing about.
Kindly give me the towel.
Thank you.
Now let's have my dressing gown back.
Come on. Give it to me.
Right away.
Go on, push off!
Hello, Elsa.
Did you look after George for me?
-Hello, darling.
-Hello, George.
-Good trip?
-Not bad. A bit dusty.
-How's Elsa?
-She missed her mom. l did my best as a babysitter, but I'm afraid I'm not the type.
Do you Know, she sat out here all night long waiting for you?
Poor thing. And poor you, too, darling.
Come on, Elsa.
I'll find something nice for you.
George seemed so recovered from his attack of malaria...
...that we left for Kiunga the very next day...
...wondering how Elsa wouId react to the sight of her first ocean.
We reached Kiunga too late for anything...
...except to make camp and then meet the local fishermen...
...who had come to tell George about their troubles with the lion killing their goats.
Under the circumstances, Elsa's presence seemed to puzzIe them considerabIy.
We were tired and had fallen asleep quickIy.
But I was awakened by noises coming from near the cars and the kitchen.
There was no doubt that our cars, or our food...
...were providing a great temptation to someone.
I didn't want to wake George.
He had looked so tired and paIe when we arrived.
-George. George!
-What is it?
There's a lion out there. l think it's John's goat-eater.
Don't be silly.
No lion would come into camp. lt's probably a hyena, or a leopard or something.
No, it's a lion. I saw it. l was out there by the cook tent.
What were you doing....
All right.
Go back to bed.
Did you see him?
Yes, I saw him. Go to sleep.
Well, what happened?
I'd rather not discuss it. Go to sleep.
What are you doing?
Getting a drink of water.
Look, will you or will you not go to sleep?
That's that.
Work finished ahead of schedule.
From tomorrow, we play.
Marvelous watchdog you are!
ImmediateIy after our first waIk along the beach...
...we all trooped down to the water's edge to introduce EIsa to the Indian Ocean.
At first she was put off by the growl and rush of the waves...
...and the taste of the water.
And perhaps, by the audience we had collected...
...and which was looking on from a safe distance.
But soon her characteristic curiosity prevaiIed...
...and she enjoyed herseIf tremendousIy.
She loved playing almost any game George invented.
At the same time, she exhibited a talent for foothall that none of us had suspected.
It was a marvelous holiday.
Until one afternoon,
Nuru came panting down the beach...
...to tell me that something was terribIy wrong with Bwana George.
I ran to our camp.
Let me get the pills.
Joy!
Here, it's all right, darling.
It's all right!
Lie down.
There, that's all right. Just give me those.
Yes, you see, medicine can be very good...
...but too much medicine can be very bad, and he has taken too much...
...and he has been too active, too soon.
He might very well have died, you see.
Indeed, I'm surprised that he did not.
Goggle fishing too soon, too soon.
He seems to be an impetuous man.
True. He's a mad, impetuous boy.
Then we must curb his impetuosity.
No more goggling.
No. He must rest and then he will get well.
We'll see to it, Doctor.
Elsa will look after him.
She's a wonderful watchdog.
Yes. I see what you mean.
Goodbye.
-Thank you very much.
-Good luck.
You mad, impetuous boy.
Like all hoIidays, ours was over all too soon.
And it was the last we wouId ever take together.
The time was approaching when our Iives would be changed forever.
Elsa was fully grown now.
She had already been in season and was capabIe of having her own cubs...
...and she started to realize there was another life...
...than the one we had been living together.
A little later, our troubIes began.
You okay?
Sorry, but I Know that lioness.
She's a friend of mine.
-You're certain she's all right?
-Completely.
She and her friend Nuru came over to say hello...
...and then went on for a walk.
But it's a good thing I spotted her collar...
...or Mr. Watson might have claimed his first bag.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Adamson, I didn't know.
After all, you don't see a lion sitting in a tree every day.
No, I suppose not.
Actually, we're looking for elephants.
I've got my heart set on getting an elephant.
Well, we do get elephants here, but not for shooting. l don't understand.
They come each year for the maize and Brussels sprouts...
...which they love, and they're usually quite well-behaved.
They fascinate Elsa, I'm sorry to say.
This is elephant season now.
Really? Do you think we might get to see some? l shouldn't be surprised.
Memsahib, Elsa playing with the elephants.
Many elephants.
No. Sorry. Come along if you want to see some elephants.
Good.
Remember, they're just for looking at.
-No shooting unless it's necessary.
-l know. But let's go.
Come in the back, there's more room.
Okay!
A few moments Iater, when we passed through the shambles of a village...
...we saw one of the resuIts of Elsa's "playing" with the elephants.
As bad as it was, it was a great relief to learn that no one had been hurt.
But now I was dreadfuIIy afraid...
...that Elsa might have been trampIed by some angry eIephant.
And then we saw her...
...very happiIy bringing home a two-year-old souvenir of the occasion.
And the damage, I'm sorry to say, is considerable.
The complaints and bills for crop damage, et cetera, are still coming in...
...and will do so for some time to come.
The point is, I'm afraid, that you can't keep Elsa any longer.
I'm not responsible for the decision.
Don't you see?
Too many people know she was the cause of the stampede...
...and from now on she'll be blamed for any lost livestock or damage.
Or for anything that any wild lion or leopard might do.
On the other hand, she might very easily be shot by anyone.
I think you were lucky the last time.
She's too big now to be allowed to roam about...
...even with Nuru or yourselves.
And you can't keep her caged all the time...
...that would only frustrate her and could make her vicious.
I'm sorry, but I think you've got to find some zoo that will take her.
I'm certain you'll have no difficulty.
She'd make a wonderful attraction.
Well, we've always known that she....
John...
...I'm sure we can solve this in time.
That's the point, my dear.
There isn't very much time.
Your long leave has come through.
How soon?
In a month. So, you see....
Well, why couldn't we take it here, in this country?
-George wouldn't mind, right, dear?
-No.
Then we could have time--
You know government policies for a completely different climate.
I'm certain we could easily find a good zoo for her in a month.
I don't want her to go to a zoo.
I want to set her free.
You can't be serious.
You'd be sentencing her to death.
You might just as well shoot her here.
He's right. She can't fend for herself.
She's never killed to eat.
She'd starve out there in the bush.
We could teach her.
You've waited too long. lt's never been done successfully.
We could try.
You know how intelligent she is.
We could teach her, train her.
George, please, let's try.
I'm sorry, darling. I agree with John.
Even if we could show her how to hunt and kill...
...she'd never hold her own against wild lions.
I don't want to part with her any more than you do.
But what's wrong with sending her to a zoo?
Everything.
I know you think I'm being foolish, but I know Elsa.
We both know she'd be miserable in a zoo.
Don't you see? She's been free too long.
I can't let her be caged for the rest of her life.
John, as a friend, give us just a little more time.
Give us three months to try.
Please!
Please!
All right, my dear,
I'll get you your three months.
But you're wasting your time.
-Could I have another drink, please?
-Yes, of course.
If Elsa were to go wiId, it wouId have to be in another district...
...and we were able to get permission to take her to a reserve 340 miIes away...
...where there was abundant game, and best of all, many Iions.
Whatever George's reservations were, he did his best not to Iet me see them.
And I was gratefuI to him.
Our plan was to spend the first week...
...taking Elsa around the new country to get her used to it.
During the second week, we intended to leave her overnight...
...and to visit, and, if necessary, feed her in the mornings.
Afterwards, we intended to reduce her meaIs...
...in the hope that it wouId encourage her to kill on her own or to join a wild Iion.
Elsa, what are you doing?
That is not your dinner.
Put that back.
On schedule, the day came...
...when we took her out to leave her overnight for the first time.
Come on, Elsa, up you get.
Come on.
Come on. Today's the day.
If that's what I think it is....
Thanks.
Crikey. What a bit of lucK.
Right off the bat.
What a handsome fellow.
Let's keep our fingers crossed.
This could solve everything.
-Do you believe in love at first sight?
-I do now. I mean, I hope so.
-George, pray!
-I am!
So far, so good.
Why don't you get her down?
I think we should let her handle this.
All talk and no action.
Beautiful dialogue, though.
You're not funny, George.
I mean, we should give her more time.
-By all means. May I smoke?
-No.
This could go on forever.
I think you'd better get her down.
All right.
Wait!
We could use a little more room ourselves.
Come on, darling, get down.
Don't be afraid.
I'm sure you'll like him.
Come on, Elsa, get down.
There's a name for girls like her.
All I can say is I'm glad you didn't behave like that.
I take it you want to try again.
-Yes?
-I was just thinKing.
If there's anything left of that Kill, and Elsa can get to it...
...and with the fresh scent of lions on it, she just might get the general idea.
Well, that's good thinKing.
I have a thought.
If we take the kill to that fellow back there...
...and he thinks she's a good provider, he might get the general idea, too.
Right. Now it all depends on....
UnfortunateIy, it turned out to be a large pride...
...who thoroughIy and unhurriedIy enjoyed their family picnic.
It was severaI hours before we got to the remains of the zebra...
...and take it and Elsa back to the young bacheIor.
Luckily, he had remained near his tree.
But he was most annoyed by Elsa's ignorance of lion etiquette...
...which calls for the lioness to bring home the food...
...and then sit by until her lord and master has had his fill.
Poor Elsa, of course, didn't know that and was properly chastised.
That evening, we suffered all the agony of parents...
...whose teenage daughter is out on her first date.
We returned the next day, only to find Elsa minus both the young lion and her food.
She was so forlorn and so happy to see us...
...that I felt guilty about the entire episode.
We took her back to camp.
We resumed basic training.
According to plan, we'd cut down on her meals...
...hoping that hunger would encourage her to kill for food.
But to Elsa, stalking other animaIs was just a game she never took seriousIy.
And she obviousIy enjoyed herself so much that it was difficult to be angry with her.
George continued to take her out every day, without resuIt.
Then, one day, she suddenIy came upon a waethog.
But Elsa's inabiIity to feed herseIf...
...meant that George had to leave the reserve every day...
...and drive a very long distance to another area...
...where the shooting of game was allowed.
-Tired?
-Yes, I am, a little.
Have a drink.
Yes.
As the weeks sped by...
...we continued to leave her overnight as much as possibIe...
...only to find her in the morning right where we'd left her...
...hungry and patheticaIIy happy to see us.
Then, one night just before dawn....
It was Elsa, and it was soon apparent that she'd had some kind of encounter...
...with other lions, or perhaps a leopard, and had not come off too well.
Sweetie. George.
I can't think how she managed to find us.
Yes, she does all the wrong things right.
Sorry.
After that, she refused to venture out of camp.
Nice.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
-Have you any idea what time it is?
-I left my watch in the tent.
No, I meant the time of year.
We've only two weeks left.
The rains will be on us soon.
Yes, I know. I know.
I've been thinking.
We've got to take Elsa out, and leave her for at least a week...
...and we've got to move camp so that she can't find us.
Make or break, is that it?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
All right.
You've missed out that pretty bit over there.
Did I?
Yes.
At last, both the week and the rains came to an end.
Well, let's try this.
All my nightmares had come true.
It won't do.
Look, by now it's obvious she can't make it.
She can't fend for herself, mix with her own Kind...
...or do anything a wild lion must do to survive.
We've....
You've done too good a job on her.
We've made her tame, and it's too late to try to let her go wild now.
All we're doing is making her miserable, torturing her.
How can you be so cruel?
Do you think I enjoy it?
I don't know what goes on in that head of yours anymore.
You have this fixed idea.
What's wrong with a zoo, anyway?
Nothing, except that she won't be free.
-And is freedom so important?
-Yes.
Yes!
She was born free, and she has the right to live free.
Why don't we live in a nice comfortable city? Other people do.
But we've chosen to live out here because it represents freedom. We can breathe.
-Because we're fit for it.
-So could she be! She can.
-She'll be safe in the zoo.
-Yes, safe.
And fat and lazy and dull...
...and stupid like some cow on a milking machine.
Joy...
...tell me the truth.
You just don't want to give her up.
What you're hoping is that she can stay out here wild but not too wild...
...so you can see her every now and then.
That's it, isn't it?
It's not the whole truth, but I don't deny I'd like it.
It's impossible! It can't happen.
Even if she should be able to go wild, which I doubt...
...that'd be the end.
You'd never see her again.
Then at least she'd be free.
She wouldn't be in a cage for the rest of her life.
And if she gets herself killed in the process?
I'd never forgive myself, I suppose.
AIthough, at one time, we were afraid she would die...
...Elsa did recover.
And when she did, she seemed somehow different.
Thanks to John...
...who was wonderfuIIy kind, despite his reservations...
...we were able to get a time extension...
...as well as permission to take her to another area...
...only 35 miIes from where she was born...
...and where George could shoot wild game.
Now, as if she knew what was required of her...
...she started going out aIone, sometimes for days at a time...
...only returning when she was hungry.
Then one day, when we'd followed her into the bush...
...she caught sight of another waethog.
Well, there's no doubt at all whose kill that is.
Congratulations.
After that, she proved again and again that she couId feed herseIf...
...and so when she came into season...
...we took her out for what became her most dangerous and final test.
No, don't.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't stand anymore.
It's all right. It's really all right.
She's done it. She's crossed the bridge.
She's wild now. And free.
You should be very happy. And proud.
We've....
You've done something no one else has ever done.
And you should be very proud.
I am...
...of her.
Well, you might at least stop laughing.
-George?
-Yes?
Suppose we never see her again?
We will. We'll come back.
We'll come here as soon as our leave is over...
...before we do anything else.
And we'll find out how she's been.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for everything.
We did go back.
We had only a week in which to find her.
We camped in the same spot, and went to look for her every day...
...hoping that we wouId see her...
...and wondering what she wouId be like if we did.
But we never found any trace of her.
Finally, it was our last day.
Wait.
Let's try just once more.
Nothing. We start back today.
Elsa and her babies stayed with us all the afternoon...
...and she made it quite clear that she was happy to be with us again.
I was dying to pick them up and hoId them, as I had done with Elsa and her sisters.
But I knew that it wouId be wrong.
They were wild...
...and it was better now that they remained wild.
Her master's voice.
Jump up, Elsa.
We saw her many times again, born free and living free.
We saw her many times again, born free and Iiving free.
But to us she was always the same:
Our friend, Elsa.
Two thousand years ago and more,
Julius Caesar came, saw and... conquered the land of the Gauls after a long and bitter struggle.
The resistance was led by Vercingetorige.
This valiant young leader... was forced to lay down his arms at the feet of Caesar. lt's an historical fact that Caesar had a lot of Gaul but he didn't have it all.
One little region held out.
A fortified village surrounded by the... entrenched Romans and it is in this village that we shall meet the hero... of our tale, the mighty warrior Asterix.
There he is now, about to go hunting for wild boar, their habit.
You'll be back soon Asterix ?
- Yes l'll be back in time for dinner.
Ah something tells me there are
Romans around here.
What hit me ?
- The Gaul keeper's key.
The occupation of Gaul as we see was no Roman holiday.
And one sweet morning the legion leader , Bonus Belonus, was meditating.
Hail Bonus Belonus !
The patrol is back.
Hail Patroleum, lets hear the report !
- Hail Bonus Belonus.
By Jupiter, how did you men get so badly beaten, were you outnumbered ?
Well, were we outnumbered ?
- Outnumbered ? l wouldn't say that.
There was a boy.
And he wasn't too big either.
By Jupiter there is a deep secret to the Gaelic strength.
Well Asterix, anything special happened ?
- Oh no, oh yes, l crowned four Romans.
That all ?
- Obelix, how would you like some boar ?
Oh sure, just got a couple of these to drop off.
Yum yum roast boars. l guess the Romans were furious.
They are going to attack us again you'll see.
Why worry as long as Panoramix can cook up his magic potion.
That reminds me this is my ration day, let's go see the old Druid.
Come along Obelix ?
- You know we mustn't waste food.
Hear that ! That's him cutting mistletoe with his golden sickle.
Panoramix, Druid ?
What's the matter Panoramix ?
- You scared me, you made me... cut my finger with my sickle.
- Sorry,l've come to get my potion.
Shhh, it's a secret, come with me !
With stirring motion l mix the potion that gives us our magic powers.
The magic potion that increases your strength a thousand fold.
Exactly what do you put into that potion, oh druid ?
The origin of the potion is lost in the darkness of the ages.
A Druid can only repeat the secret to another druid, all that l can tell you... is that it contains mistletoe and lobster, the lobster is not necessary... but it tastes good.
Can l have some too ?
- No Obelix, no no you know you can't !
You fell into the potion when you were just a baby and the effects... of the potion on you are permanent, you know that.
Why don't you try out the effects of the potion for us ?
Sure here l go. lt works, old druid it works.
Those poor poor Romans, how sorry l feel for them.
And now lets see what the Romans are up to.
And in spite of our siege, these Gauls go on defying us ! lf they are going to fight one against four it isn't fair !
We have to find out their secret .
- You're right Marcus Sufrus. l must have a volunteer, who will go and spy on the Gauls ?
With so many volunteers l 'll decide by playing musical chairs.
This game which has come to us down through the ages. lt was played with one chair less than there were legionnaires ... when the music stopped... lt's Caligolaminus ! lt's Caligolaminus ! lt's Caligolaminus !
No no l won't go
- Caesar will reward you Caligolaminus.
No not me !
Either you volunteer or l will feed you to the lions. lf you insist, l'll go.
- Make a Gaul out of Caligolaminus.
Meanwhile in the Gaelic village...
Men it's a long time now since we last heard from the Romans, that's a bad sign.
We must be vigilant and remember to get your ration of the potion.
Hooray for Tunabrix, our chief !
Hooray for Tunabrix, our chief !
Chief ! Chief !
- Yes Obelix ?
Panoramix won't give me any potion, that's not fair. Because l feel weak.
You weak ?
- Oh my oh my, here comes Stopthemusic ! l shall now sing a lay in honour of Gaelic courage !
Barbarians, they can't appreciate my art.
Caligolaminus is now ready !
- Good, lets go and see.
Put him in chains.
You're going for a stroll near the village of the Gauls, when the Gauls see you ... they'll rescue you, when you'll be within their gates, you'll learn their secret.
Now how do you like my plan ?
- Well just between us l don't understand.
Take him to the enemy.
- Take it easy, easy man easy ! l'm a real Roman, l'm a Roman, hey ! l'd like to get into a good fight.
- Yeah but don't count on it Asterix.
The Romans are staying close to their camp, they're tired of getting beat.
What's that ?
The sound of chains
Somebody's arriving, up the tree.
How long are we going to have to walk like this.
Shut up, you'll be the only one spared when the Gauls attack, don't forget !
Romans coming, they've got a Gaul.
- Let's save him ! l feel better.
Let's we wake them up and start again.
No come on, it's getting late.
- Come along little fellow.
Mission accomplished.
Well lets take off his chains.
- But you can't do it without tools.
Tools ? Who needs tools ?
Well who are you ?
- l'm Cali... Caligoliminix. l live in Lutetia.
But the Romans and Gauls live in peace there, don't they ?
Well in their eyes l appear so foxy, that they think l am a spy.
The Romans take you for a spy ?
Are they stupid ?
The heroic patrol, commanded by
Marcus Sufrus returns to the camp.
At HamsweetHam.
Oh hail, the Gauls came they saw and they freed Caligolaminus.
What a great victory for us ! l hope that Caligolaminus will come back to us in a single piece. l hope so for him otherwise l'll grind his pieces to pieces.
And throw him to the lions.
Poor Caligolaminus.
We're approaching the village, there you'll be safe. There's only us Gauls.
Oh great !
Asterix and Obelix they brought company !
- l wonder who it is.
You'll have to meet our chief, the great Tunabrix.
Where are the Romans ? Let me at them !
Where are the Romans ?
Here we are ! l bid you welcome brother and l hope you'll feel at home.
Well, thanks.
And now l shall carol a song of welcome.
Stroll around the village till supper.
- All right. l'll find out what sort of tools these Gauls use to work their metal.
Hey come on Obelix , that stone !
- Here it is, coming right up.
Gosh They really are strong !
There must be a secret to this power.
Hey Caligoliminix ! Supper's ready !
Roast boar.
- Roast boar ? ls there a secret to your super human strength ?
Yup, but we can't tell it.
Why don't you eat ? lt'll get cold otherwise.
Why can't you tell me what the secret is ?
- Because it's a secret. lt's not fair ! lf we Gauls can't share our secrets, what's the use ? lf l was as strong as you l could get past the Roman line and get back to my home.
What do you say ?
- Well l say lets finish his roast boar.
My relatives are probably worried.
- Well lets go and see the Druid.
Panoramix ! Panoramix !
What do you want now Asterix ?
Me, nothing, but our new friend want to know why we're so strong. lts absolutely out of the question.
But l have to get home to get back to work.
What do you work at ? l'm a guide, l guide for Lutetia by night. National tourism.
No ! No ! And No !
All right, l get it, you don't want me. l'll get to Lutetia anyway and if the Romans throw me to the lions... at each bite l'll say,
''You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
You can blame Panoramix the Druid !
Oh Well, all right !
- Come back Caligoliminix !
Come back, Caligoliminix ! l'll show you the secret of our power, l'll even give you a portion of a potion. lt's a secret you can drink ?
- Go call the others Asterix. lt's a secret you can drink ?
- Go call the others Asterix.
Get your magic potion !
Come and get your potion !
Come and get your potion !
Magic ?
- Potion ?
Come and get your potion !
- Magic ?
Potion ?
- The magic potion ?
A portion of this potion, can give you the necessary strength to return... to Lutetia but the effects of it disappear quickly. lt tastes like vegetable soup.
- l can make it taste like other things... lamb barbecue, clam chowder, cheese omelette, steak and onions...
But l don't feel anything special.
- Why don't you try lifting up that rock ?
But l will never be able to.
Hey little fellow, you have to be careful anyway.
What are we going to do now ?
- Were going to dance.
Lets the dance now begin !
Take your places !
Step to the right !
Step to the left !
Left row forward, right row back !
Mark your places, reach your partner.
Pull your partners moustache !
Pull your partners moustache !
These are removable moustaches,
They are the latest style in Lutetia.
Your are no Gaul, you're a Roman spy.
Get the Roman ! lt's no use Asterix, remember he just drank the potion. lt's because of you that he escapes.
By my golden sickle, you are the one who insisted that l give him some.
Lets forget it, he didn't learn much and the effect will disappear soon.
Hail Bonus Belonus ! l've learnt the secret of the Gauls. lt's a magic potion.
Where is this potion ?
- Here here here !
Come along Caligolaminus, l want to see what effects this potion produces.
Fight them !
Fight them ! l said fight them !
- Him ? Fight us ? By Jupiter, he can't !
We'll make mincemeat out of them.
That's that !
Wonderful ! Trouble is we don't have the potion to study ! l suggest we cut him open just like a rabbit.
You just try it, come on you just try it.
Your idea isn't bad, but
Caligolaminus refused to cooperate.
Sure l refuse !
How long is the potion effective ?
How long ? l don't know.
All right, lift that rock.
There you are.
What a man ! Now don't move, when that rock gets too heavy for you ... it'll mean the effects of the potion have completely disappeared.
Much much later...
Well now, you don't feel quite so strong ?
- No not quite. lf l can find out what's in that potion, l can become emperor, Bonus Caesar.
We leave Bonus Belonus to his dreams and return to the Gauls. l'm going to gather mistletoe.
- Do you want me to come along ?
No Asterix, you stay here and protect the village, your strength is ... due to my potion but your intelligence was yours from the day you were born.
Anyhow l won't be very long.
All right.
You Roman nincompoops !
We've captured the Druid, Bonus Belonus.
- Bravo, Julius Octopus, as a reward... you can have a pass to go to Rome and see the circus.
Rome, l'm going to the circus !
Rome, l'm going to the circus !
Druid tell me your secret.
- The secret ? Not on your life.
This man must talk, get me the torturer.
We'll see if he'll talk or not.
Cough !
Come on druid ! We've been torturing you for hours and it hasn't helped. lt has helped me pass the time.
- Speak, l'll make you powerful and rich !
No !
You will have lots and lots of money.
No
The magical powers of this Druid are much too strong for me.
And he's so stubborn, a stubborn as a mule.
What's the matter Asterix ?
You look worried.
The Druid went to gather mistletoe and he hasn't come back. l'm going to go and find him.
- Be careful Asterix !
You had your potion a long time ago.
- Well l'll just have to trust my brain.
Panoramix !
Druid, where are you ?
Panoramix !
Panoramix !
Panoramix !
Don't worry, don't sell your oxen.
- Then what ?
Just sell your cart .
- What ?
Just sell your cart and go home with your oxen.
What a brilliant idea that is !
Stop, stop enough !
Tell me, have you seen a Druid gathering mistletoe ?
No but l did see one being carried in a net, a group of legionnaires.
They were taking him to HamSweetham.
What ? You take me to Hamsweetham.
- But that is a way out of my way !
Hamsweetham is the biggest market around and it has a great used cart park.
How lucky for me to have met you,
Hamsweetham, here we come.
Why are you hiding ?
- To play a joke on my Roman pals.
That's great, l love jokes.
This jackass should get the laurel wreath for stupidity.
What are you carrying in your cart ?
- Nothing.
By Jupiter, are you laughing at me ?
What is going on here Cracsus Daris ?
This sap is laughing at me, l'll have to check his cart.
Let him enter, l know him he's not dangerous.
That idiot had almost got me caught.
Here we are in camp, are you going to play your joke now ? lt's dark, ln the morning it'll be funnier.
- Oh sure.
Goodnight... l better start looking for the
Druid, lets start there.
Lie down and dine, oh Marcus, my loyal right-hand. We must talk.
Thank you Oh gracious Bonus.
We must get the secret recipe the
Druid has for the potion, understand ?
And when we do we shall march on Rome and take the place of Caesar.
Julius Caesar ?
Right friend, Jules, and the two of us will form a powerful triumvirate. l have need of him now but later in Rome, l'll be the triumphant. l'll have him eaten by a lion in Rome, l shall become Caesar, just me, all alone.
This is very interesting but it doesn't help me find Panoramix the Druid.
Oh he's certainly being guarded in that tent. l beg your pardon, l've come to free Panoramix, my friend.
Don't let him get out, he's an unconquerable Gaul. l'll go get some help.
- Sure go.
Asterix !
- How are you ?
Have you gone mad ? Why did you come here you've walked into the lions den.
Chief ! Chief !
These asses can't do a thing against my magical powers. l know that, lets have some fun, with them, l 've got a few ideas.
Chief ! Chief !
Oh Bonus Belonus
- What now ?
We've captured a Gal, G, Gaul in the t, tent of the D, D Druid.
We need reinforcements or the prisoner is sure to get away.
By the great Jupiter, sound off the alarm !
Surrender, you Gauls, if not l'll order my brave legionaries to attack you. l hope he surrenders.
The suspense is killing me. l toss my weapon at your feet as
Vercingetorige, my chief, tossed his ... at Caesar's feet, come on, l'm surrendering. l've got no time to waste !
Seize that Gaul or l'll have you all fed to the lions.
Lions ?
- Fed to the lions he said !
- And he means it too.
Hey what's happening ?
The camps been invaded by a Gaul.
- Well that's not fair, he might have waited will l woke up to begin his joke.
He doesn't play fair, it's not nice !
So you refuse to speak, do you Druid ?
But tomorrow on the torture rack ... your friend may be a bit more gracious !
They've no idea how loquacious l'll be. l'll break the record for loquacit
Shh they're coming !
Bonus Belonus wants to see you.
You, do you know the secret of the magic potion ?
Me ? No !
- For the last time Druid... give me the recipe for the magic potion or l'll have your friend tortured.
You can't scare me Roman.
- l trust in the courage of my friend.
Well, we shall see, l want this Gaul tied to that table, and go get the torturer.
Here l am, you know my motto, always ready.
Pity please, don't hurt me, l can't take anymore !
Enough, l can't see him suffer like this, l'll tell you all.
Torturer, desist !
But chief l didn't even get started.
Oh pity please, pity please !
OK druid, let me in on the secret, if not l'll have him finish the job. l'll prepare the potion in front of you but l need a number of ingredients... that l can only find in the forest.
- What scared-i cats these Gauls are !
You will have what you need, go with him l will hold the other Gaul as a hostage. l'll need mistletoe... herbs and a few roots, and some flowers.
The Druid is back.
- Now he wants a big pot.
Then give him one !
Just a pinch of salt, a tiny touch of pepper and let it bubble.
Bubble ? Bubble oh make it bubble fast.
- Something is lacking.
An ingredient that is important,
- What ? What ? What ?
Strawberries.
- Strawberries at this season ?
Of course it won't be that easy, we could wait until the right season.
No, send out our fastest messengers, l want strawberries, strawberries !
Strawberries, strawberries !
Asterix, you get good ideas.
- You are the one who thought of ... sending them strawberry picking, while we lounge at Caesar's expense.
The messengers have been gone for days, not a single one has returned.
The messengers have come back !
- That's fine.
Hail Bonus Belonus.
- Hail my legionaries, did you find them ?
No, no sir !
- No strawberries Bonus.
- And we lost Julius Octopus.
Here l am Bonus Belonus, look l found the strawberry, l ran into a route... merchant just back from Greece, l had to pay their weight in gold !
That's good, you shall have a reward, l grant you a pass to Rome and you've... my permission to go to the circus.
- l'm going to the circus !
Druid, here are the strawberries you needed for your magic potion.
What do you think of them Asterix ?
- l'm not sure they are of fine quality.
Could be worse. l've changed my opinion they are excellent.
Yes, just what l needed for my potion, send for another basket. l've had about enough, you're driving me mad, you're not being fair.
All right, all right, take it easy, don't cry l'll prepare your potion.
Stop crying, he'll prepare it.
- Sure, l'll make it without strawberries.
Of course it won't be as sweet.
- Anyhow strawberries ... can give you a rash. lt's ready, it's best to serve it hot.
- l'll be first.
Where is the proof that your potion is not a poison, by Jupiter ? l'll be happy to taste it first if you are afraid.
No, if this potion is the real one it will increase your power ... and you will become invincible. l want a volunteer ! l said l am calling for a volunteer.
Oh Bonus Belonus, don't risk the life of a legionnaire, try the potion ... on some ordinary person for the experiment.
Good idea !
You come over here, friend.
- Who me ?
Are you well, my good friend ?
- No l am not, l was told l could sell ... my cart but no one wants to buy it, and it is all his fault ! l don't quite get what you mean but for consolation you may have some of this.
No thanks, l don't drink.
Drink it !
Why are you looking at me ? Didn't you ever see a cart dealer taking a drink ?
After drinking this potion, you are the worlds strongest man.
Me ?
You're so funny, he's a big joker.
We'll find that out, punch somebody !
- But l'm not mad at anybody.
A volunteer for a good wallop ! l would like a bit more enthusiasm when l call for a volunteer.
Me, l'll volunteer.
- You, that's an idea By Jupiter.
Go on !
- Go ahead hit him !
Go on, hit him !
- Hit him, you fool !
By Jupiter, its absolutely marvellous.
Did it hurt much ?
- l thought the sky dropped on my head.
Well you don't need me anymore so, l guess l'll go.
That potion is simply, that is its magic.
Forward, come and get your magic potion.
The road to Rome lies before us, oh Marcus, Caesar's days are numbered.
You Druid, you write down the recipe of the magic potion.
They will be cooked once it is in our possession, that will teach them a lesson.
A good idea yes.
Let us tryout our great new strength. l'm trying to over do it. l'll try that boulder.
A smaller one. l'm strong, l am a superman !
What great power !
- Yes ?
Bonus Belonus ?
- Yes ?
There is no powers in lifting that little stone.
You're right !
So you tricked me you Gauls, this potion is not magic.
Yes it is !
Oh Bonus Belonus, lets settle the hash of these Gauls.
How dare you appear before me without shaving ?
A good legionnaire should be clean shaven !
You are right but a legionnaire leader should set an example.
But, what, what is gong on ?
- Look at them !
What's happening here Druid ?
- lt's an old formulae for a hair growing... lotion, an extremely powerful one, the hair on you heads and on your face... will grow and grow with the fastest pace. l will have you killed.
Give me the anti-dote for this. lf you kill us who will make the antidote for you ? We are a little bit tired today.
- Yes, we are going to retire to our tent.
Hey you two ! Wait, hey !
What's wrong oh Bonus Belonus ? l caught my foot in my beard, imbecile ! l am at the mercy of these Gauls, l'll have to bargain with them.
Three thousand and seventy five.
- What ? lt's a new game we invented, one who sees a beard gets 15 points, 10 000 wins.
You've got your goal, you Gaul, well what do you want ?
Promise not to split hairs about it ?
- Don't you mention hairs again, you hear ?
That's for the beards.
- No wait, please.
All right but don't get in my hair again.
Oh to be exact to a hair we'll listen !
All right, l give up, just give me the antidote and l'll let you go free.
Well you see l don't feel very much feel like working now.
He gets a hand for being hair brained.
You wouldn't think he's just had a close shave.
All right, all right don't get so upset, l'll do it. l'll have to go out again and... get all the ingredients in the forest.
Yes but with an escort.
Why did you accept so fast, he's up to no good.
The effects of the potion l laid down aren't going to last very long.
Tomorrow there won't be any beards, so we had better try to get out of here.
As soon as l'm rid of this long hair and this beard, l'll murder those Gauls. lt will give me a riotous satisfaction.
We have come to escort you to the forest to gather the ingredients for the potion. l have a plan.
- That's great, we've got a million idea.
You will keep off my beard.
Keep your beard off from under my feet.
Come on hurry, our beards keep growing. l think that now l have got pretty much what is necessary. lt's only us.
- That's fine, well get to work. l've been working all morning, l hope l will be able to take a rest sometime.
Where are you going ?
- Can l see him prepare the anti -dote ?
No, better not, you would hinder us, you are too nervous.
You guards, watch this tent, see to it they don't escape.
Well that's good, you see Asterix, in the small pot l have prepared ... our real magic potion, l think we will need your muscles if we are to get out ... of here and here in the big pot l have prepared the anti dote. water, salt, vegetables and a marrow bone, since we have to taste it in front... of the Romans l thought you would like something good.
The magic potion is ready, might as well take a good portion.
All right now call our bearded hosts.
Hey Romans, soups on !
You bring that pot out here.
- All right, all right.
You taste it first. ls it good ?
- lt's fine but l like it with more salt. lt's your turn Bonus Belonus.
How can we really be sure that this potion keeps the hair from growing longer ?
You really are clever, watch my moustache you will see, it has stopped growing.
By Jupiter, it is true, drink men.
They swim like swine.
- Yes.
Now my guards, seize those two Gauls.
- The pleasure is mine.
Not by the hair of your chinny chin chin.
Let me go, please let me go, help me.
Run, we'll leave while they are picking up the pieces. l was just starting to have some fun.
- Halt you, get back in there.
Romans !
More Romans !
Many more !
More there ! We are surrounded.
Reinforcements, they got here just in time, what luck. lt's not so good.
Now l've got you Gauls, l'll have you eaten by the lions.
Oh Bonus Belonus, you are awaited in your tent, it's urgent.
Urgent ?
- Yes urgent.
Who's cloak is this littering my tent ?
Remnant of Caesar, that which is Caesar.
Julius Caesar ?
- ln person. l have come to find out what you are been doing about he Gauls.
And I want to know what has been going on here to keep your garrison... from receiving me with all due honour.
Well you see, l mean, we have been fighting what l mean is with some Gauls.
Fighting with Gauls ? How many Gauls ?
- Two.
By Cleopatra, show me the two man who are capable of standing up against... a garrison of my legionaries.
Well so there are the terrible Gauls ?
Tell me just what happened here ?
Caesar, Bonus Belonus was trying to steal our magic potion so he... would be invincible. He intended to become emperor.
Well, well
- Oh well, let me explain...
You need not bother, and go and shave will you ? You and your men will be... leaving for Mongolia, there're other barbarians there who tried to oust me.
But l could explain everything.
- And as for you, in exchange for the services you have rendered l shall... allow you your liberty, but we will meet before long, Gauls. l'll count on that Caesar.
By the Gods here they are.
Hooray Panoramix, Hooray Tunabricks our chief hooray Asterix,
Let us rejoice because our brothers have reached a decisive new victory.
Hooray for Tunabricks our chief.
Let the festivities start.
Under a star studded sky, the little fortified village of brave Gauls celebrated one more victory. Obtained through the protection of their Gods. lntelligence, magic and courage, they knew the future would bring them ... further victories over the Roman legions.

{19084}{19108}More.
{19157}{19224}I told you to stay|away from that window.
{19465}{19521}- Was she your sister?|- No.
{19548}{19591}She was my partner.
{19676}{19715}Are you French?
{19741}{19784}English.
{19835}{19867}I'm Irish.
{19918}{19965}I was born in Dublin.
{19992}{20040}In the central prison.
{20058}{20106}I had to obey and I did.
{20125}{20163}Blew it all up:
{20165}{20215}The bridge, the soldiers...
{20254}{20288}and my father.
{20332}{20387}They always wind up like that.
{20396}{20480}- I'm afraid it runs in the family.|- Runs in the family?
{20515}{20543}You see this?
{20544}{20639}My people have been fighting|the English for a very long time.

{21378}{21435}The Prince of Wales.
{21441}{21502}His beard smelled of eau de cologne.
{21543}{21587}- He is a friend of yours?|- No.
{21589}{21702}In Paris, he once came backstage, walked|right up to me and he gave me a kiss.
{21707}{21774}I was already a star and only 15.
{21777}{21811}Look.
{21829}{21886}That's when I tried drama.
{21928}{21975}I did all the classics:
{21979}{22052}Romeo and Juliet,|Othello, East Lynnet.
{22079}{22119}Now I just sing.
{22133}{22185}Nothing's like music hall.
{22204}{22271}It's the greatest|training you can get.
{22352}{22445}- Is acting an interesting life?|- Of course, it's the best.
{22470}{22517}If you like to travel.
{22631}{22675}Music hall is beautiful.
{22792}{22841}You don't happen to dance?

{23024}{23086}One day, I tried to use powder.
{23089}{23155}Papa grabbed the puff and|slapped me on both cheeks.
{23157}{23197}No more powder.

{23362}{23440}If you paint it on thick|enough, you don't feel scared.
{23456}{23528}- Scared of what?|- All those people out there.
{23538}{23589}The men who stare.
{23645}{23710}Well, I'm not afraid|of men. You'll see.
{23713}{23751}Do you know any?
{23779}{23805}I guess not.
{23951}{23998}How frightful not to be able...
{23999}{24063}to get a decent cup|of tea in this country.
{24105}{24211}My dear Johnson, if the water isn't|good, what can you expect of the tea?
{24534}{24611}Lace it with a bit of|brandy. That'll cheer it up.
{24667}{24724}- Passport, please.|- Yes.
{24776}{24830}We're looking for a terrorist.
{24846}{24934}A young chap. Haven't|seen anybody, have you?
{24946}{25013}Good gracious, no, not a soul.
{26203}{26247}Don't wake her up.
{27156}{27197}What's happening?
{27199}{27270}Relax. We've left the|British Empire behind.
{27374}{27451}- Who is that girl?|- Who is that Englishman?
{27467}{27556}Rodolfo, come here and|meet my new partner.
{27644}{27713}Oh, that's right. I|don't even know your name.
{27715}{27785}- Marie Fitzgerald O'Malley.|- Marie?
{27793}{27820}Mary?
{27834}{27892}I'm not Mary. Marie.
{27908}{27960}Mary and Mary.
{27999}{28038}That's splendid.
{30352}{30425}You could try a little harder.
{31136}{31188}Help me!
{31485}{31537}My God, they are so vulgar.
{31687}{31734}What's the house like tonight?
{31736}{31781}Oh, as usual.
{31787}{31854}They're not too bad. Could be worse.
{31856}{31880}Go on, once more:
{31882}{31949}And being drunk on too much champagne
{32013}{32076}Discovering this gallant heaven
{32091}{32129}- Two minutes, girls.|- Already?
{33736}{33785}- Darn!|- What is it?
{33787}{33828}I can't remember how it begins.
{33830}{33898}We sang of the|sweetness of the tropics.
{33908}{33946}We sang of Venice and its gondolas.
{33947}{33987}We sang of the British grass.
{33989}{34069}But there is nothing like Paris.
{34519}{34629}We sang of the|sweetness of the tropics
{34630}{34729}We sang of Venice and its gondolas
{34734}{34834}We sang of the British grass
{34840}{34937}But there's nothing like Paris
{34963}{35019}- You all right?|- Guess so.
{35020}{35070}It's such a stupid song.
{35076}{35171}Pretty white stockings|and black garters
{35175}{35250}Pretty coquettes with high boots
{35278}{35386}Sweet darlings in frilly lace
{35391}{35482}This is Paris
{35485}{35566}This is Paris
{35791}{35851}- I have a problem.|- Shut up and sing.
{35855}{35950}We sang of Geneva and its mountains
{35952}{36040}We sang of Verona and its lovers
{36045}{36155}We sang of the guitars of Spain
{36162}{36238}But Paris will always win
{36241}{36325}Fleeting glimpses of women
{36327}{36430}Suzon, Fanchon, Lisette, or Nini
{36436}{36526}Elegant ladies or housemaids
{36902}{36978}- What'll I do now?|- Well, do the same thing.
{36994}{37089}In every corner of our old Paris
{37092}{37186}From the Eiffel Tower to the Opera
{37189}{37290}From the Moulin Rouge to|Boulogne and Notre Dame
{37297}{37373}There's always a heart beating
{37397}{37484}Laundress or granny
{37509}{37628}Bejeweled ladies
{37655}{37775}Seamstress and heiress, too
{37786}{37880}This is Paris
{37890}{37986}This is Paris
{38316}{38396}If you come from Norway or China
{38425}{38527}From the Transvaal or Montenegro
{38533}{38628}Whether you come from|Egypt or Argentina
{38657}{38764}You'll feel at home on the Trocadero
{39584}{39702}Like being drunk on too much champagne
{39748}{39865}Discovering this gallant heaven
{39918}{40036}In love there is always a winner
{40047}{40147}Because Paris will always be Paris
{40152}{40269}Because Paris will always be Paris
{40941}{40999}This will revolutionize show business.
{41085}{41134}If Papa could see me now.
{41159}{41236}Go get some clothes on,|I'll take you to the ball.
{42189}{42252}I don't know how to dance, I'm sorry.
{42509}{42549}I'd like a drink.
{42834}{42876}So that's liquor?
{43086}{43128}I like it.
{43340}{43387}You little scamp.
{43390}{43445}But, Mother, I'm 17 and a half.
{43447}{43538}Drunk at your age. You've|plenty of time for that later.
{43618}{43665}What is Rodolfo doing?
{43715}{43807}He's inventing the perfect weapon,|a gun with a crooking barrel...
{43809}{43849}so he can shoot around corners.
{43852}{43893}It's an obsession.
{43957}{43981}What a pity.
{44002}{44038}He's kind of nice for an Englishman.
{44674}{44738}Werther, it's our waltz.
{44740}{44803}Ja, our waltz.
{45263}{45297}What did he say?
{45299}{45356}He spoke to me of love.
{45361}{45400}I might've known.
{45422}{45472}I'm not sure what love is.
{45474}{45527}But I'm dying to be educated.
{45542}{45595}Love is marvelous.
{45613}{45660}Look at Madame Diogène.
{45666}{45761}Werther, I feel like|I'm floating on air.
{45866}{45912}Pleasant dreams.
{46020}{46076}Aren't you girls going to bed?
{46160}{46218}Listen, one month|ago in Porto Visto...
{46220}{46282}Janine, poor Janine...
{46297}{46395}showed me a man|standing on a balcony...
{46402}{46472}who was devouring my every move.
{46476}{46550}He was Spanish, but he acted French.
{46571}{46653}At my curtain call, he tore|the flower from his lapel...
{46656}{46736}threw it at my feet,|then left without a word.
{46828}{46878}You'll never believe it...
{46883}{46964}but this went on after every|performance for one whole week.
{46972}{47027}- Was he handsome?|- In a way.
{47089}{47139}He was more distinguished.
{47142}{47174}All man.
{47206}{47244}Hard to resist.
{47522}{47618}So the last night, I picked up his|flower and threw it back to him.
{47620}{47659}He understood.
{47661}{47763}He took me to supper. He was very|correct and gallant in all things...
{47773}{47814}a little awkward.
{47912}{47942}Go on.
{47953}{48033}We had to leave by the|next morning at dawn.
{48066}{48132}When I left, he was still asleep.
{48178}{48254}- I didn't even wake him.|- Why didn't you stay with him?
{48259}{48319}I hardly knew him. Are you mad?
{48897}{48963}That's how it is.|That's show business.
{48977}{49022}Here today, gone tomorrow.
{49194}{49286}Still, if I ever do meet|the man of my life...
{49294}{49365}I'm sure I'll know him at first sight.
{50136}{50184}What do you take me for?
{50721}{50764}Marie isn't back yet.
{50766}{50805}Mary? No.
{51989}{52030}Come on, come on.
{52192}{52228}Good morning.
{52388}{52429}I'm bushed.
{52502}{52544}You were right.
{52635}{52689}Love is too marvelous for words.
{56396}{56490}You left my life for no reason
{56502}{56580}You left my sight for no reason
{56598}{56677}In the fountain
{56741}{56834}In the fountain where|the peacock slept
{57120}{57225}In the fountain where|the peacock slept
{61272}{61358}You can chose between
{61363}{61428}two legs or two eyes
{61452}{61536}One must always have two
{61539}{61617}to seek a fortune
{61618}{61694}But blonde or brunette
{61699}{61768}In Paris they are better
{61777}{61842}One equals two
{61843}{61920}And two makes only one
{61931}{62015}Ah! Women Parisian women
{62259}{62323}I multiply one
{62325}{62370}I multiply two
{62372}{62467}It's unfortunate that|they are such a problem
{62474}{62553}Ten times or a hundred|times It's too dangerous
{62559}{62604}God have mercy
{62607}{62671}Get rid of them both
{62678}{62758}Ah! Women Parisian women
{62950}{63026}Holding a grudge
{63032}{63103}won't make you happy
{63106}{63173}Say goodbye
{63173}{63260}Because two is one too much
{63266}{63344}There's only one head left
{63350}{63408}Ah, no, there are two
{63415}{63475}Every one
{63477}{63564}will find his one
{64988}{65042}Lost a glove
{65051}{65092}A run in my stocking
{65118}{65184}My petticoats are in rags
{65229}{65304}Make no mistake, this|stripping onstage...
{65311}{65363}doesn't help this wardrobe.
{65437}{65477}It's incredible.
{65480}{65544}The fashions have|changed again in Paris.
{65616}{65683}- You don't care, do you?|- Not a whit.
{65741}{65799}I suppose you're right at that.
{65948}{66006}You are quite happy as you are?
{66020}{66073}Quite happy. You're not?
{66076}{66133}Me, happy? I don't know.
{66144}{66203}Do you understand? I'm bored.
{66208}{66274}You can't call these|rubes a real public.
{66275}{66315}Country bumpkins.
{66324}{66364}What's the matter?
{66367}{66410}You're getting homesick?
{67353}{67386}Dirty blackguards.
{67389}{67419}The brutes.
{67890}{67928}Good shot, indeed!
{68222}{68293}Forgive me, please.|I had to do something.
{68783}{68862}Ladies, what an unexpected pleasure.
{68885}{68943}And what unexpected marksmanship.
{69762}{69812}Welcome, Señor Florès.
{70209}{70250}Do we know each other?
{70252}{70292}My name is Florès.
{70306}{70361}I spoke to you one night.
{70371}{70435}When? Where?
{70458}{70524}Doesn't matter. It|meant nothing to you.
{71334}{71400}All around me, I could|see only misery...
{71409}{71483}injustice, and brutality.
{71515}{71563}And so I left my village.
{71596}{71650}I rode though the countryside.
{71660}{71718}I spoke to the villagers,|and they listened.
{71719}{71768}Some of them joined me.
{71778}{71837}We had but a few weapons among us.
{71853}{71941}Most of them were captured or killed.
{71972}{72061}For two months, I have|been running from Rodriguez.
{72090}{72166}With a price on my head,|I know what to expect.
{72213}{72279}But what's it all for?
{72316}{72355}The revolution.
{72612}{72677}Well, what are you|going to do with us?
{72705}{72765}Señor Rodriguez will decide.
{72767}{72824}Tomorrow, he will let you know.
{73382}{73463}Sleep, now. The sandman has passed.
{73634}{73682}You still smoking?
{74136}{74198}You're wasting your|time with 12-caliber.
{74199}{74246}The casing's too short.
{74258}{74352}Try upping it to 30.|You'll increase your range.
{79528}{79562}Rodriguez!
{80991}{81037}They took both girls away.
{81039}{81071}What for?
{81098}{81203}With a man like Rodriguez,|we must expect anything.
{81783}{81845}Oh, it's the new Vickers.
{81914}{81961}Not quite, Mademoiselle.
{81963}{82043}It's the Skyton-Babbit, 1907.
{82048}{82097}The latest model.
{82252}{82325}I see that you are interested in guns.
{82327}{82398}Enough to be able to shoot my men.
{82422}{82471}Do you know who you are dealing with?
{82473}{82541}I have electricity. Padre.
{82601}{82698}I am the only one within|a radius of 50 miles.
{82715}{82742}Look.
{83565}{83591}Good.
{83835}{83876}I'm not a brute.
{83903}{83945}I am very modern.
{84004}{84051}I love art...
{84059}{84123}especially the School of Paris.
{84212}{84257}My little Parisians.
{84262}{84340}Now I'll teach you a little game.
{85101}{85136}That music...
{85181}{85224}The Lady in White.
{85254}{85290}What does it mean?
{85292}{85357}That means they are going to die...
{85380}{85427}but before they die...
{88942}{89010}Grant them eternal rest, O Lord...
{89015}{89083}and may everlasting|light shine upon them.
{90525}{90549}Good.
{90551}{90584}Come here.
{90636}{90668}Come here.
{92293}{92358}Ah, you have certainly|messed that up, my son.
{94243}{94274}Look out!
{94990}{95080}I'm going to die. Take|me back to my village.
{95609}{95699}What are we going to do when|we do get to the other side?
{95728}{95767}We told you already.
{95769}{95818}We are going to take Florès home.
{95819}{95886}For the moment, we've two objectives:
{95891}{95954}To give Rodriguez and|his men the slip...
{96073}{96128}and to keep ourselves fed.
{96591}{96642}Shit! Notre Dame!
{98007}{98067}- You'll be home in a few hours.|- Maria...
{98103}{98136}No, don't speak.
{98137}{98219}- Maria, I am dying.|- Don't say that, please.
{98221}{98285}No, listen to me, Maria.
{98290}{98358}Continue with my cause when I'm dead.
{98379}{98451}- Swear to me you'll go on fighting.|- Fighting, me?
{98453}{98513}- Florès, how could I?|- Go on, swear.
{98569}{98603}Yes.
{98610}{98640}I swear.
{98790}{98817}I swear it.
{99005}{99040}There it is.
{100283}{100321}Hurry. Quick.
{100563}{100610}The doctor is not home.
{100627}{100675}- They have all gone.|- That is strange.
{100677}{100723}The village is completely deserted.
{101011}{101042}Rodolfo!
{101168}{101234}He's getting worse. What can we do?
{101281}{101374}Ave Maria
{101378}{101496}Long live the rosary
{101502}{101620}Long live Saint Dominic
{101627}{101732}That he founded
{101740}{101828}Ave Maria
{101829}{101887}Well, there are your villagers.
{101918}{101990}He has a family here.|He will speak to them.
{102269}{102300}Mama.
{102375}{102406}Dolores.
{102413}{102472}What are you doing here, Domingo?
{102557}{102647}Did you come to see your wife?
{102663}{102697}Your mother?
{102710}{102748}Your children?
{102771}{102861}Or did you forget that|you left them here...
{102872}{102913}left them alone...
{102931}{102985}to follow your hero Florès...
{102989}{103078}like a dog, loyal and stupid.
{103088}{103119}Get out!
{103125}{103178}Get out and do not come back.
{103197}{103230}All of you.
{103251}{103309}There is no place for you here.
{103388}{103443}All of you followed Florès...
{103448}{103516}down the path of crime and revolution.
{103535}{103580}Now go back to him...
{103590}{103638}wherever he is hiding...
{103646}{103716}and tell him never to return again.
{103739}{103778}Florès was alive.
{103823}{103857}I loved him.
{103979}{104021}Florès is dead.
{104040}{104065}I mourn him.
{104278}{104341}I am not here to revenge one man...
{104365}{104420}but to bring a nation justice.
{104441}{104483}What is she up to?
{104512}{104554}It's her big scene.
{104638}{104681}Florès is dead.
{104720}{104782}His last noble thoughts were for you.
{104792}{104843}These will I now undertake...
{104856}{104903}to faithfully transmit.
{104950}{104990}Yet what do I see?
{105039}{105083}A flock of lowly sheep...
{105084}{105152}who cringe and dare|not raise their heads.
{105220}{105258}Oh, judgment...
{105282}{105340}thou art fled to brutish beasts.
{105361}{105429}Alas, have all men|then lost their reason?
{105438}{105491}Shakespeare, Julius Caesar.
{105495}{105542}Act 3, Scene 2.
{105549}{105635}Are you not exploited,|degraded, whipped?
{105661}{105706}Yet you say thank you...
{105709}{105766}and you bow to your oppressors.
{105822}{105854}Rise...
{105890}{105941}and freedom will answer you.
{105943}{106018}Stand up and let the|mountains ring with your anger.
{106020}{106079}Always hate, hate and more hate.
{106096}{106172}You speak like Florès,|you will end like him.
{106269}{106357}Is there any man here so base|that he is willingly a slave?
{106388}{106451}Let that man now speak...
{106479}{106527}for him I have offended.
{106626}{106666}I'm waiting for an answer.
{107363}{107417}She was very good.
{108934}{108975}Congratulations.
{108978}{109015}Quite a show.
{109084}{109146}Everybody thought you were sublime.
{109183}{109235}Madame Diogène was about to cry.
{109336}{109392}All I felt for you was shame.
{109433}{109484}I've done as Florès requested.
{109485}{109541}Don't you dare speak of Florès.
{109877}{109921}So what do you expect to do?
{109923}{109972}I have sworn to carry|on the revolution.
{109973}{110010}The revolution?
{110055}{110092}You're a fool.
{110099}{110128}Perhaps.
{110141}{110200}And how? With who?
{110200}{110234}With them.
{110321}{110404}But stop and think. You|are only courting trouble.
{110406}{110457}I've already given my word.
{110517}{110565}Well, don't count on me.
{113182}{113234}Give me your lighter.
{113253}{113307}She doesn't have a chance.
{114332}{114372}Climb up there and cover me.
{114374}{114405}All right.
{114496}{114554}Don't move! Stay where you are.
{114680}{114724}Shoot anything that moves.
{114725}{114798}You others keep cover.|I'll take care of this.
{121474}{121514}Thank you, Marie.
{121568}{121617}The pleasure was all mine.
{121865}{121965}Well, it looks to me as if we've|got ourselves into a revolution.
{121975}{122045}What did you say? It's a revolution?
{122062}{122104}It is now.
{122873}{122929}Take me to the Father Superior.
{122983}{123049}The Father Superior.
{123209}{123286}- Domine benedictu.|- Padre!
{123478}{123543}- What happened, my son?|- Maria.
{123596}{123624}Maria?
{123634}{123726}No. Maria and Maria. Two.
{123728}{123800}- The revolution.|- Two?
{125820}{125857}The revolution?
{125879}{125922}Led by two women?
{126556}{126631}To arms, citizens,|form your battalions.
{126633}{126729}March! March! Before an|impure blood floods our fields.
{126962}{126997}This is our infirmary.
{127536}{127617}We have no intention of|attacking the United States.
{127683}{127749}On the contrary, we|respect your country...
{127751}{127792}liberal and modern.
{128098}{128188}However, your government|has to realize...
{128193}{128272}that here we are still|in the Middle Ages.
{128282}{128364}Are you aware that the|whole nation of San Miguel...
{128366}{128480}- still belongs to 14 families?|- Then you are against private property?
{128505}{128567}Private property is highway robbery.
{128738}{128835}We won't give up our fight|until the dictator is eliminated.
{128978}{129008}Our army.
{129027}{129074}Sit over there, please.
{129243}{129298}The viaduct at Barharen. Interesting.
{129371}{129405}And then what?
{129407}{129472}I also blew up the|prison in Palmares...
{129486}{129538}the bridge at Los Andos...
{129548}{129599}the cathedral in Chicacao...
{129609}{129659}the mines at Totonicapan.
{129711}{129774}Our objective is now the capital.
{130177}{130233}They have blown up my statue.
{130269}{130307}Send out our special armored train.
{130347}{130399}You mean the train of death?
{130413}{130437}Yes.
{133566}{133593}What?
{133641}{133686}You're a fool.
{133719}{133798}All is not lost. Our|fight has just begun.
{135072}{135188}THE LIBERATOR
{136929}{136963}THE LADIES OF PARIS
{137621}{137678}Now they're performing miracles.
{137775}{137809}Sacrilege!
{138094}{138154}Padre, what'll I do now?
{138195}{138257}This affair no longer concerns you.
{138280}{138316}Leave it to me.
{138680}{138720}It's a message from Pablo.
{138722}{138781}He will meet us up|north, with 600 guns.
{138783}{138818}And if all goes well...
{138819}{138893}tomorrow, at the break of dawn,|all of us will attack San Miguel.
{139425}{139522}- Can I help you, Padre?|- You may conduct me to Maria and Maria.
{140137}{140203}We're alone, as you requested.
{140205}{140270}- What do you want?|- We know who you are.
{140271}{140356}- You hold the power to...|- I'm the servant of the Lord.
{140359}{140391}But you...
{140393}{140441}you profaned our sacred rites.
{140443}{140518}Shrines are raised in|your honor by the peasants.
{140520}{140577}Are not the two of you|worshiped like saints?
{140579}{140641}- They want revolution.|- No.
{140649}{140689}They want chaos...
{140690}{140727}and violence...
{140746}{140782}and scandal.
{141046}{141106}Show your hand. What do you want?
{141155}{141198}My task is difficult.
{141201}{141254}Who knows? God may be on your side.
{141256}{141329}- Do you doubt it?|- No man is ever sure.
{141427}{141480}He sometimes appears to us...
{141506}{141551}just when we least expect.
{141730}{141811}We'll bring down San Miguel|tomorrow, whatever the cost.
{141813}{141845}Is that so?
{142081}{142168}Help us to see the light,|oh, Lord, lest we err.
{142209}{142280}Padre, what exactly|are you getting at?
{142464}{142522}Reach for heaven, my daughters.
{143466}{143490}Damn!
{143628}{143655}We must warn Pablo.
{145044}{145099}We do not wish to do you harm.
{145114}{145198}If you'll just sign the paper in|which you recognize your errors...
{145200}{145274}we shall put it on the|walls of the churches...
{145281}{145334}and order shall be restored.
{145368}{145454}- But then you must leave the country.|- No! No! No!
{146025}{146108}Pablo, they have been taken|prisoner. We must attack.
{148970}{149056}Come, come! Hurry, my children.
{149059}{149094}Hurry, quickly.
{150104}{150138}Oh, I am sorry.
{150140}{150213}Nobody has used any of|this equipment in ages.
{151455}{151526}Go shoot those two women at once.
{151890}{151935}No. I protest.
{151947}{152002}They're the property of the church.
{153166}{153214}Now we'll see if it works.
{156277}{156396}SAN MIGUEL NATIONAL BANK
{156674}{156714}Take cover, men!
{158871}{158904}Are you afraid?
{158930}{158972}A little, yes.
{159038}{159072}Ready.
{159152}{159188}Aim.
{159214}{159243}Fire!
{159414}{159448}Are you dead?
{159455}{159505}No, you?
{159522}{159559}I'll kill you myself.
{159761}{159801}So sorry, girls.
{159814}{159862}We were almost too late.
{162088}{162129}We've done it.
{162131}{162191}Florès is avenged. Satisfied now?
{162207}{162235}I just feel tired.
{162621}{162652}I'm happy.
{162666}{162713}So happy.
{163864}{163899}Ah, women.
{165896}{165947}THEY RETURNED TO EUROPE
{165950}{166040}FROM THEN ON, EVERY NIGHT...
{166088}{166164}On the other side of the ocean
{166166}{166240}The two young women meet
{166243}{166305}In the jungle of the tropics
{166404}{166470}Together they share|thousands of adventures
{166476}{166546}Strange and very dangerous
{166555}{166628}Over there, over there
{166661}{166764}The first one was dark
{166766}{166855}And her name was Maria
{166865}{166942}And the second one was blonde
{166946}{167052}and her name was also
{167057}{167103}Maria
I've said for years that our special equipment is obsolete.
And now, computer analysis reveals a new approach: miniaturization.
For instance, radioactive lint.
When placed in an opponent's pockets...
...the personnel and location fix seems obvious.
What we want is a location fix on 007.
Number 10 is making ugly noises about Operation Bedlam.
Miss Moneypenny, did you check with Communications?
Replies to our Cairo, Amsterdam and Madrid inquiries: all negative.
The PM wants to be informed personally when we find 007.
Good morning. My name's Bond.
James Bond. Miss...?
Don't move, Mr. Bond.
Now get up!
Put your hands behind your head.
Move!
Get in.
Lie down.
This never happened to the other fellow.
- Baggage, sir?
- In the boot.
- Take care of those clubs.
- Right, sir.
- Commander Bond. How are you?
- Good to see you, Manuel.
Everything seems up to the Palacio's usual standards.
Yes, it's a good season.
That red car, does it belong to a lady?
Yes. Contessa Teresa di Vincenzo.
Our best.
Fortunately, we have had a cancellation.
Allow me.
This will do.
This will do me nicely.
I'm sure we can look after your special needs.
I'm sure you can. Thank you.
Thank you.
Twenty thousand francs.
Too rich for my blood.
Madame?
I don't have the money.
I regret too, but I don't have any money.
The dame can't pay up.
Forgive me.
My mind was elsewhere.
Madame has forgotten we agreed to be partners this evening.
Please continue.
That's lucky, being bailed out like that at the last minute.
Waiter.
- Dom Perignon, '57.
- Yes, sir.
Why do you persist in rescuing me, Mr. Bond?
It's becoming a habit,
Contessa Teresa.
Teresa was a saint.
I'm known as Tracy.
Tracy, next time play it safe and stand on five.
People who want to stay alive play it safe.
Please stay alive, at least for tonight.
Come later.
I hope it'll be worth it, partner.
Send it to suite 423 with caviar for two.
Tracy?
Tracy?
Gatecrasher.
I'll leave you to tidy up.
Royal beluga, north of the Caspian.
- You're full of surprises, contessa.
- So are you, Mr. Bond.
Do you always have a gun for a rendezvous?
Occasionally. I seem to be accident-prone.
I'll take that, if you don't mind.
You're very confident.
Suppose I kill you for a thrill?
I can think of something more sociable to do.
Stop playing games.
Who was that man in your room?
- You're hurting me.
- I thought that was the idea tonight.
Now, who was he?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I can be a lot more persuasive.
I'm sure you can.
Whatever else I may be,
I'm not a liar.
Get dressed.
You're the most extraordinary girl.
I'm not interested in your opinion of me, Mr. Bond.
- I'm here for a business transaction.
- Really?
Isn't Le Bleu a bit heady for that?
You know your perfumes.
What else do you know?
A little about women.
Think about me...
...as a woman you've just bought.
Who needs to buy?
Look, you don't owe me a thing.
I think you're in trouble.
Would you like to talk about it?
No, Mr. Bond.
The only thing you need know about me is that I pay my debts.
Twenty thousand francs is a lot of money.
- Good morning, Commander Bond.
- Good morning. Café complet for two.
- Yes, sir.
- Connect me with suite 423, please.
The Contessa di Vincenzo has left the hotel, sir.
- Checked out?
- A few minutes ago.
Thank you.
Paid in full, as well.
- Mr. Bond?
- Yes.
- You've lost something.
- Really?
We'll give it to you outside.
Why not? Perhaps we can make up a foursome.
You've thought of everything.
What a lovely surprise, our meeting again so soon.
Where's the party this time?
- You have an appointment.
- Business or pleasure?
Mystery tour, eh?
I think we'd enjoy it more without that.
Do not kill me, Mr. Bond.
At least not until we've had a drink.
Then if you wish, I'll give you another chance.
I'm Draco, of Draco Construction.
- But today is the 13th, commander.
- I'm superstitious.
- A martini for our guest.
- A pleasure.
Shaken, not stirred.
- Of course.
- Campari for me.
My apologies for the way you were brought here today. Please sit down.
I was not sure you would accept a formal invitation.
There's always something formal about the point of a pistol.
Thank you, cheri.
Olympe, we will finish our struggle later.
As you wish.
And she also plays a very good game of chess.
Cheers.
You usually drink Corsican brandy.
What else do you know about me?
Marc Ange Draco:
Head of the Union Corse.
A big crime syndicate in Europe.
- The biggest.
- Not quite.
An organization known as SPECTRE operates worldwide.
But your legitimate business fronts are more extensive.
Construction, electrical supplies...
...numerous agricultural holdings.
Your dossier on me...
...is not entirely complete.
I am also Teresa's father.
- Tracy.
- Yes, Tracy.
Tracy. My only child.
Her mother was an English girl.
A romantic who had come to Corsica to look for bandits.
Rather like those women who ventured into the desert looking for sheiks.
She found me in the mountains...
...hiding from the police at the time.
I came to love this girl.
We married. The result: Teresa.
Twelve years later, my wife died.
I sent Teresa to Switzerland...
- No, thanks, I prefer my own.
- ...to finish her education.
Unfortunately, I didn't give her a proper home.
She was without supervision.
So she joined a fast international set.
One scandal after another.
When I disapproved, cut off her allowance...
...she committed some greater folly...
...to spite me.
And yet, behind her bravado...
...something was eating away at her soul.
This can happen to men and women.
They burn the heart out of themselves by living too greedily...
...and suddenly...
- ...all is finished.
- Why tell me this?
She married...
...an Italian count who killed himself...
...in a Maserati with one of his mistresses.
I gave her too much, and it brought her nothing.
Now, why I tell you all this.
I've been informed of everything you've done for my daughter.
- Everything?
- Don't worry. Don't worry about that.
What you did, the way you behaved...
...might be the beginning of some kind of therapy.
She needs help.
Your help.
I find her fascinating, but she needs a psychiatrist, not me.
What she needs is a man to dominate her...
...to make love to her enough to make her love him.
A man like you.
You overestimate me, Draco.
She's very attractive, but what you ask is not for me.
Listen to me.
On the day you marry her...
...I'll give you a personal dowry of one million pounds...
...in gold.
That's quite an inducement.
But I don't need a million pounds.
And I have a taste for freedom.
Please, just see her some more.
Who knows what will come of it?
I'm sorry, Draco, but in my profession, I can't--
- What?
- You have connections not open to me.
Where is Ernst Stavro Blofeld?
Blofeld?
Some of my men defected to him.
I don't know where he is.
- Can you find out?
- If I could...
...I wouldn't tell
Her Majesty's Secret Service...
...but I might tell my future son-in-law.
Go on.
Next week is my birthday.
For that, Teresa always comes back to me.
You understand?
- Let's say I'll sleep on the idea.
- You do that.
James, where have you been?
- Much too far from you, darling.
- Same old James.
Only more so.
Heartless brute, letting me pine away without even a postcard.
Pine no more.
Cocktails at my place,
8- ish, just the two of us.
Oh, I'd adore that...
...if only I could trust myself.
Same old Moneypenny:
Britain's last line of defense.
You'd better go in.
He's running a very tight ship today.
I'm relieving you from Operation Bedlam, 007.
But, sir, Blofeld's something of a must with me.
You've had two years to run him down.
You've lost confidence in me?
I'm well aware of your talents, 007...
...but license to kill is useless unless one has a target.
I'll find you a more suitable assignment. That's all.
- Sir--
- That's all.
That was a quick conference.
How do you expect a girl to keep herself alluring-- ?
Take a memo, please.
- Ready, James.
- Sir, I have the honor to request...
...you will accept my resignation, effective forthwith.
- Resignation from what?
- Her Majesty's Secret Service.
And kindly present it to that monument in there.
Sorry, ma'am.
James Bond here.
He wants you, James.
Request granted.
Request granted.
Not even with regret.
What did you expect, a knighthood?
Why don't you read it?
''Two weeks leave.''
You didn't really want to resign, did you?
Moneypenny, what would I do without you?
My problem is that you never do anything with me.
It's a date. The moment I get back.
- Where are you off to?
- Just someplace to laze about.
Beachcombing.
What would I do without you,
Miss Moneypenny? Thank you.
Bonjour, Miguel.
- Teresa, hello.
- Good morning.
- It's so nice that we see you.
- How are you?
- Yes, very well.
- There's Tracy.
Where is she? Ah, there she is!
- Teresa!
- Happy birthday, Papa.
You make it so by being here.
You look marvelous.
There's someone
I want you to meet. Come.
- Olympe, how are you?
- It's good to have you back.
- You look wonderful.
- Thanks.
Mr. Bond, may I introduce my daughter, Teresa?
- Contessa.
- Mr. Bond and I have already met.
Each time is a renewed pleasure.
Madame always makes one feel so welcome.
She likes you. I can see it.
You must give me the name of your oculist.
Olympe, I didn't know
Mr. Bond knew Papa.
There is much about Mr. Bond one does not know.
It would be interesting to attend night school, perhaps.
Papa is up to something.
I'm sure of it.
Your father loves you very much, Tracy.
Whatever he may arrange,
I know it's for your happiness.
What has Papa arranged?
- Ah, Mr. Bond!
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Many happy returns.
The best years are still to come, let's hope.
Allow me.
What are you doing here?
Yes, wasn't it kind of your father to invite me?
We're discussing a business deal.
Really?
No woman would waste this excellent champagne discussing business.
Unless she happened to be part of the arrangement.
What did you say?
Don't blame Olympe.
I'm not your daughter for nothing.
I detect a certain family resemblance.
I suggest you revise the terms of your contract, Mr. Bond.
- Your liability is too expensive.
- There you're mistaken.
- Papa.
- Yes?
- Mr. Bond wants some information.
- What are you talking about?
You taught me that a good host supplies his guests' needs.
And without obligation.
- And then?
- ''Obligation'' is not the right word.
Tell him, Papa.
Tell him what he wants to know.
- Now!
- Please, Teresa.
There's only a possibility.
Nothing definite.
Tell him, Papa, or you'll never see me again.
All right.
All right.
There may be a connection between that man Blofeld...
...and a lawyer with offices in Bern, Switzerland.
- Named Gumbold.
- Gumbold.
- Bern, Switzerland.
- Yes, Gumbold.
So...
- Mr. Bond need have no interest in me.
- Another mistake.
She always was a headstrong child.
I'm sorry--
Where has he gone?
Tracy!
Tracy.
I was always taught that mistakes should be remedied.
Especially between friends.
Or lovers.
I'll catch up with you later.
- The story of our life, James?
- Just keep my martini cool.
I will be back in an hour.
Such things should be left to a girl's father, who knows best.
But what could be better than being in love?
Mr. Bond is in love with you?
That may come too...
...someday.
Life's too short for ''someday,''
Teresa.
Tomorrow I will speak to him alone, man-to-man.
- No, Papa. No talk.
- Why not?
Whatever happens, there'll be no regrets.
Please.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon. Is the admiral in?
Excuse me, sir.
Commander Bond to see you.
Show him in.
- Aye, aye, sir. If you please.
- Thank you.
Unusually small for a Nymphalis polychloros.
I wasn't aware that your expertise included lepidoptery.
- Why are you here? You're on leave.
- Genealogy.
Fascinating subject.
Found a letter from Gebrüder
Gumbold, solicitors in Switzerland...
...to a certain
Count Balthazar de Bleuchamp.
- De Bleuchamp?
- French form of Blofeld.
You've been relieved from
Operation Bedlam, remember?
I assumed you'd reassign me, sir.
This is a Photostat copy of a letter...
...addressed to College of Arms in London...
...with a request to establish de Bleuchamp's claim to the title.
Sir Hilary Bray, the sable basilisk of the college...
...has replied to Gumbold, suggesting they meet in person.
I've taken the liberty of working with the college on this...
...using an examination of my own family as cover.
I've also been studying the technical side of heraldry.
- Sir Hilary Bray. Commander Bond.
- Ah, yes, sir.
If he consents to a meeting, I could act as a college representative.
Come.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Look at this. Let me take your coat.
Arms of Sir Thomas Bond,
Baronet of Peckham, died 1734.
Argent on a chevron sable.
Three bezants.
Good motto, eh?
''The World is Not Enough.''
- Phidian's doing a splendid job.
- Thank you, sir.
We've traced your line to a Sir Otho le Bon...
...who held the manor of
Wickhamsbreux by a knight's fee...
...from the Earl of Thanet, 1387.
We're in luck.
Gumbold's telephoned from Bern...
...to say that his client will see me.
- You mean me.
- Yes, you.
But, Commander Bond...
...I'm only able to countenance this deception...
...on your assurance this matter is of national importance.
I haven't exaggerated.
We appreciate your help.
All right. During the deception period,
I've arranged to go to Brittany.
I want to do some brass rubbings.
Where do I go for this meeting?
They want a description of myself.
- Tactfully adjusted to favor me.
- Yes.
They will send the time and place where I am to be...
...collected, as they put it.
It's not our sort of thing, but under the circumstances...
- Sounds like they're suspicious.
- No, not suspicious.
Just discreet.
There was no objection to my fee of 1000 guineas.
- Could their claim be genuine?
- It's hard to say at this point.
We never like to speak until we're absolutely certain...
...that there's no error on our side...
...or forgery on theirs.
I hope I meet your high standards.
One helpful physical point might be...
...that the real de Bleuchamps are without earlobes.
It's not the sort of thing that we rely on, but it could help.
- No earlobes.
- You might invite him to Augsburg.
They've been there for generations.
Yes, I'd like to get him away from Switzerland.
- Sir Hilary Bray, baronet?
- The same, dear lady.
I am Fraülein Irma Bunt, personal secretary to the count.
- Have you had a good journey?
- No, quite intolerable.
I'm not a good traveler.
I'm sorry. Grunther will take your luggage.
- No, I can manage.
- I take it.
- You know Switzerland, Sir Hilary?
- I'm afraid not, Fraülein...?
- Bunt.
- Bunt.
Interesting name for a genealogist.
- Are you from a naval family?
- Naval?
It's a nautical term, meaning the baggy or swollen parts of a sail.
- Nothing personal, of course.
- Interesting.
- You speak German?
- I'm afraid not.
- French?
- A little. Where are we off to?
You will not be disappointed.
Please?
Like the bugs in a rug, yes?
- You are comfortable?
- Yes, indeed, fraülein.
- Your kindness is quite overwhelming.
- Good.
So we are halfway.
Now we will have a little flight.
I've never been in one of these.
You must your pipe knock off.
''Knock out,'' you mean.
I hope.
Mind your head, Sir Hilary.
Please fasten your safety belt.
Now, up into the Alps.
That is avalanche damage.
You enjoy the skiing or the bobsled perhaps?
I'm not a sporting man, fraülein.
Even when I'm at my best.
Do you feel the airsickness?
Up to there is for the public, and from here upwards it is private.
No one may come through without permission from the count.
There is the Bleuchamp Institute for Allergy Research.
- What kind of allergies?
- All of them.
Like the hay fever, or the sickness caused by the oysters...
...or inability to eat meat.
The count is a great specialist in this field.
I'll be glad to get my feet on the ground.
Not ground. Ice.
I should warn you, guns make me very nervous.
They are to keep the spies from the chemical companies.
Many times already they have tried to steal our discoveries.
We live in a world of avarice and deceit.
- Here at least is no avarice.
- Really?
The Bleuchamp Institute is not for profit, Sir Hilary.
The count does his work for the sake of mankind.
I'm very happy to hear it.
He wants to leave his mark on the entire world.
- Characteristic ambition.
- Characteristic?
Of a true humanitarian.
Formerly it was a sports club, open to the public.
Now it belongs to the count, who has given it to scientific research.
Joseph, Sir Hilary Bray will take number four.
I'll show you there after Grunther takes you for medical examination.
- I'm quite all right now.
- You are our honored guest.
Thank you.
After your experience in the helicopter...
...we must make sure you are well again.
Grunther, take Sir Hilary to Dr. Von Sant.
Yes?
Give him the usual comforts.
You have 10 minutes...
...and then take them to number four.
If you wish anything for your comfort, you must ring this...
...and the attendant will come.
Very considerate. Thank you.
You must also ring for him to open the door when you wish to leave.
- Complicated arrangement.
- To stop patients leaving their rooms...
...when they should be resting.
The count believes very strongly in undisturbed rest.
Prudent fellow. When can I see him?
We have much to discuss.
He will send for you when he's ready.
Meanwhile, I'd like you to join me in the Alpine room before dinner.
- Alpine room?
- Yes. Grunther will come for you.
- Shall we say 7:00?
- Thank you.
Fraülein Bunt will receive you.
Sir Hilary, please, come to meet our patients.
- This is Sir Hilary Bray, baronet.
- How do you do?
He's a famous genealogist.
You will have a drink, yes?
- Please, come and sit down.
- How do you do?
Thank you.
- What is a baronet?
- An inferior sort of baron.
- Oh, how disappointing.
- Well--
Oh, I don't mean you're inferior.
I mean the title is.
What's a gyn-- genealogist?
What is that?
An old people's doctor.
So he's here to cure Fraülein Bunt?
Be careful. She's got ears like an elephant.
- What will you drink, sir?
- Malt whiskey and branch water.
I'm sorry I was so rude about what a baronet is.
You gave a very accurate description.
- Sir.
- Thank you.
It's a treat, having a man here for once.
You mean there aren't any others?
Only the staff, and you can't really count them.
Don't discuss the affairs of the clinic.
Yes, but what is a genealogist?
Will nobody tell me?
- I would be pleased to tell you.
- Well?
Genealogy is all about ancestors and families.
It could easily be that any one of you here is related to a royal house...
...if only we could go back far enough to find out.
Now, if you will tell me your names--
We do not use surnames here.
It is a rule of the clinic.
I'm so sorry. I didn't know that.
Come, it's time for dinner.
Our schedule is rather strict.
So is our diet.
Please, if you will sit there between Helen and Ruby.
I've never had much to do with young ladies.
I have ordered you a steak Piz Gloria.
- I hope you enjoy it.
- Thank you. I'm sure I will.
- Are you here for Christmas?
- Well, I might be if--
- We can have a party before we go!
- That's not quite in my line.
Delicious! I used to hate chicken.
It used to make me break out all over.
You'd be surprised where.
Potatoes did it to me.
Now I adore them.
No medical histories, please.
Girls, I'm sure Sir Hilary would like to tell us about the College of Arms.
Go on, Sir Hilary.
Please tell us.
- If you'd really enjoy that.
- Please. Yes!
- We promise to listen.
- Would you?
Come on, tell us all about it.
The Heralds' College, or College of Arms...
...consists of 13 members of the royal household...
...appointed by the sovereign to superintend...
...armourial, genealogical, ceremonial and other matters.
The 13 members are divided into three categories...
...kings, heralds and pursuivants.
Their titles and offices are of great antiquity.
Well, the first Clarenceux
King of Arms...
...was created in 1334...
...and the first
Somerset Herald in 1448.
Now, when we authorize a coat of arms...
...it can include all sorts of funny things...
...crescent moons, portcullises...
...beasts couchant and rampant, bars, bezants--
Please, what is ''bezant''?
Gold balls.
I brought a book on the subject with a picture of my coat of arms.
Which includes four of them...
...if you'd care to see them.
I'd love to. I'm in room--
No, no. He will give the book to me.
I will pass it to everyone in turn.
- It is fairer like that.
- Of course. If you think so, fraülein.
Is anything the matter, Sir Hilary?
Just a slight stiffness coming on in the shoulder.
Due to the altitude, no doubt.
The count will see you.
Grunther will take you.
Thank you.
Please excuse me, ladies.
May all your allergies be swiftly cured.
- What a nice man.
- Sweet!
I know what he's allergic to.
Bezants...
Antisepsis.
Please wait here.
- Good evening, Sir Hilary.
- Good evening.
Balthazar, Count de Bleuchamp.
If you'll forgive me, that's what
I'm here to find out.
To confirm. There can be no doubt of the truth.
- Please, sit down.
- If there were no doubt...
...I'm sure I would not have been sent.
Well, since you are here, I'll make everything very plain to you.
To begin with, I was born without earlobes...
...a well-known congenital distinction of Bleuchamp ancestry...
...like the Hapsburg lip or the hawk nose of the Medicis.
Granted, but the fact that you're a de Bleuchamp...
...doesn't make you the reigning count.
I feel it in my blood and in my bones.
I'm afraid the college will require more concrete proofs.
And it shall have them.
I have assembled all the relevant documents...
...title deeds, certificates of birth and death.
I'll send them to your room for authentication.
You've only to ask Fraülein Bunt for anything you require.
- Are you comfortable here?
- Yes, but puzzled by your clinic.
The methods of the great pioneers often puzzle conventional minds.
I've devised a cure for allergies...
...which depends on holding an unusual...
...and delicate psychological balance.
So I must impose rather special conditions on my patients.
And your laboratories?
The cure is not entirely psychological, Sir Hilary.
There are special vaccines to be prepared.
Vaccines which must be modified to suit each individual case.
So I'm a very busy man...
...and I cannot spare you as much time as I might wish.
To be confirmed as Count de Bleuchamp...
...you must give me some of your time.
I need details of your living relatives, parents and grandparents.
- The documents you will see--
- Can answer questions, but not all.
Oh, one more thing.
It would help if you could accompany me to visit Augsburg.
- Augsburg?
- The de Bleuchamps' ancestral home.
There are tombs in the cathedral...
...and important records in the city archives.
You there to assist with your personal knowledge--
That may not be convenient for some time...
...but my title shall be recognized.
You may proceed with your preliminary research.
I'll be happy to start immediately.
Thank you, Herr Grunther.
Sir Hilary!
I brought you the book.
- The illustrated book?
- No, don't turn it on.
- I want to see the pictures.
- You're a picture yourself...
...and twice as lovely in the firelight.
You are funny, pretending not to like girls.
Well, I don't usually.
But you're not usual.
That lipstick was an inspiration.
So are you.
Oh, Sir Hilary.
Call me ''Hilly.''
Hilly.
What's your name?
Ruby Bartlett, from Lancashire.
- Morecambe Bay, actually.
- How did you get here?
Do we have to talk about that now?
It's true!
How did you get here?
I had this awful allergy about chickens.
My family has a chicken farm...
...and whenever I had to work on it
I nearly died.
A specialist said there was a Swiss clinic...
...where they cured you, free, because they're doing research.
Go on.
No, about the clinic, I mean.
Well, the specialist had me meet
Fraülein Bunt in London...
...and she said I had a very interesting case.
How right she was.
Oh, Hilly!
Oh, bother!
No, Hilly.
It's part of the cure.
Cassette number seven.
Number eight.
Do you remember when you first came here...
...how you hated chickens?
How you were sick when you even saw one?
But all that is over now...
...for I have shown you how foolish it was...
...and your cure is nearly done.
I have taught you to love chickens...
...to love their flesh, their voice.
Yes, your cure is nearly done.
And soon you will go home...
...to look after the chickens that you love so much.
You do love me just a little, don't you, Hilly?
- Learn one more thing before you go.
- Ruby.
I must teach you how to give them special care.
I will tell you what to do.
- Ruby, wake up.
- I will tell you when.
I will tell you how.
And after you've done what I teach you...
...you will forget it forever.
Forever.
Hilly, you old devil.
- It is me, yes?
- Quite undeniably, yes.
How did you get out?
With a fingernail file.
It's so easy.
I wouldn't know.
- I come to see the book, the pictures?
- Jolly good idea.
Now, where did I put it?
I had it a few moments ago.
- Perhaps if we turn on the light?
- No.
You're a picture yourself.
And twice as lovely in the firelight.
- But, Sir Hilary--
- Hilly.
But I think you do not like girls, Hilly.
Usually, I don't, but you're not usual.
Coming here was an inspiration...
...and so are you.
You'll need to be.
- What you say?
- A miracle, our meeting like this.
I don't even know your name.
I tell you all about myself later.
In the morning.
Hey.
What about a lift to the top?
It is not permitted.
All is private.
But surely there's a restaurant, a club up there.
I've seen them advertised.
- It's all closed now.
- Since when?
- I've seen them advertised.
- You are mistaken.
For many weeks, they are finished.
But I'd still like to get to the top.
From here up, it's forbidden!
Private! Closed!
All right.
It's my turn now.
- Sir Hilary!
- Good morning.
Good morning.
Your stiffness of last night...
...it is all gone?
- For the time being.
- Then come and do curling with us.
- Won't that be frightfully energetic?
- No.
- We'll show you.
- Perhaps you'd teach me.
- Have a go.
- We expect great things of you.
We're leaving very soon.
I must see you.
Eight o'clock tonight.
And the man was alone?
- Good morning, ladies.
- Good morning!
Good morning, Sir Hilary.
How's your research?
Riveting, and very promising too.
I've never heard anything so ridiculous in all my life!
Since when is climbing a criminal offence?
Excuse me.
Piz Gloria, sir, is private property.
The whole bloody Alp?
Ridiculous!
There are many signs, and my servant warned you down at the station.
Your throw, I think it is.
I had my throw.
Made a mess of it, I'm afraid.
That didn't count.
You can throw again.
- Yes, go on.
- Very civil of you, fraülein.
-- doesn't entitle these goons to shoot at me. Who the hell are you?
I am the director of this institute.
You'll be sent back down and will refrain from troubling us again!
What about my belongings?
- They will be sent later.
- But they're mine!
We have certain rules which must be observed.
- The authorities will hear about it!
- Good day.
Director-- Or count, as I think I can now safely say...
I thought I'd take the afternoon off, so if you send the car down--
But you've already had the morning off.
Must have a bit of fresh air.
Those ancestors are hard work.
And the College of Arms is being very well paid.
- If you put it like that--
- I do put it like that.
I'll show you what I've done, then we'll plan the trip to Augsburg...
- ...and finish it.
- Over Christmas?
The archives will be closed, will they not?
Come, girls, it's time for our massage.
Girls, that is enough curling for today.
- I must see you tonight.
- Nine o'clock?
Ten? Well, back to work.
You've no idea how it's piling up.
Ruby! It's me, Hilly.
Hilly's so sad that Ruby's leaving.
Has that old cow told you-- ?
Fancy meeting you here, fraülein!
Merry Christmas, 007.
I'm Sir Hilary Bray.
No, no, Mr. Bond.
Respectable baronets from the College of Heralds...
...do not seduce female patients in clinics.
On the other hand, they do get their professional details right.
The Bleuchamp tombs are not in the Augsburg Cathedral, as you said...
...but in the Saint Anna Kirche.
Sir Hilary Bray would've known.
A small slip.
Takes more than a few props to turn 007 into a herald.
It'll take more than cutting off your earlobes to turn you into a count.
I may yet surprise you, but I'm afraid you have no surprises left for me.
I know all about your mission,
Mr. Bond.
Your colleague...
Such a keen climber, such a brilliant conversationalist...
...before he left us.
- Of course he reported where I am.
- I doubt that.
In any case, no one's going to come to your rescue.
In a few hours, the United Nations will receive my yuletide greetings:
The information that I now possess the scientific means to control...
...or to destroy the economy of the whole world.
People will have more important things to think about than you.
If they believe your threat.
They will. In any case,
I have prepared a demonstration.
Remember that disagreeable outbreak...
...of foot-and-mouth disease in England last summer?
Well, I shall instruct them, in very convincing terms...
...exactly how I arranged that.
And my capacity has improved since.
Allergy vaccines?
Bacteria. Bacteriological warfare.
With a difference.
Our great breakthrough since last summer...
...has been the confection of a certain...
- ...Virus Omega.
- Infertility.
Total infertility in plants and animals.
Not just disease in a few herds,
Mr. Bond...
...or the loss of a single crop...
...but the destruction of a whole strain, forever...
...throughout an entire continent.
If my demands are not met...
...I shall proceed with the systematic extinction...
...of whole species of cereals and livestock all over the world.
Including, I suppose, the human race?
I don't think, do you, Mr. Bond...
...the UN will let it come to that.
Not after their scientists analyze a small sample...
...of Virus Omega they have received.
Epidemics of sterility.
Nothing is born.
No seed even begins to sprout.
- They'll find an antidote.
- Of course!
If I give them enough time.
They'll have time.
Once they're warned, you'll have a problem dispensing it.
That problem has already been solved.
I have been training my own special ''Angels of Death.''
Those girls.
Those girls, and many others like them.
But exactly how?
That will remain my secret.
How many hundred millions do you want for your services this time?
This time? This time, the price is of another kind.
You'll be amused when you know what.
In the meanwhile,
I will keep you here as my guest.
You'll be very useful in helping to convince the authorities...
...that I mean what I say...
...and I'll do what I claim.
Come. Let me show you to your new quarters.
You're likely to be with us for some time, Mr. Bond.
So first...
...a little therapy to soothe your restless nature.
Poor fellow. He was restless too.
You perverse British, how you love your exercise.
Every year, dozens of amateur climbers end in the same predicament.
A kind of waxworks show for morbid tourists.
Dear, dear me.
Now, now. Now, Mr. Bond, you must learn to be absolutely calm...
...before we can accept you back into polite society.
Presents!
Going-away presents...
...from the count himself, in appreciation.
- I want to open mine now.
- No.
It is more fun to open them all together, yes?
Please sit down.
We will wait for the others.
Look, look, look!
Eggnog on Christmas Eve.
Just like home!
It is a treat for the going-away party.
- Your very good health, my dears.
- Cheers! Cheers!
It has been so nice to cure you.
It has something special in it for the Holy Night celebration.
And now you're going on a journey.
A journey home.
But first you must rest for a while.
Rest. Rest.
Rest...
I will tell you when, and I will tell you how...
...but it must be our secret.
Yours and mine. Our secret.
And after you've done what I teach you...
...you will forget it forever.
Forever. Forever.
And now you may open your eyes again.
Each of you has been given a present...
...such a prettily wrapped present.
Now is the time to open them.
Open them.
You see, they're beautiful...
...and you're longing to know what's inside.
You may use anything but the atomizer...
...which you must never touch, never...
...until I tell you how and where to use it.
Open the compact.
Adjust the bottom control.
Every night at exactly 12:00, you must be alone...
...so you can switch on that receiver...
...and listen for my voice.
I'll tell you what to do,
I will tell you when...
...and I will tell you how.
After you've heard what I say...
...push the mirror back to conceal the receiver again.
Push it back now and close the case.
Now rest again. Rest.
Rest.
In a few minutes, you will wake up.
You will not remember what I just told you...
...until you return home.
- What a lovely present.
- I don't feel too good.
Please, girls, we are in a hurry.
Merry Christmas.
Maybe you should've been gift-wrapped.
Flare.
- He's making for the village.
- Head him off at the precipice.
Idiot!
Goodbye, girls. Merry Christmas.
And a happy New Year.
Goodbye!
Bye!
Come on.
James.
Darling, what is it?
- There's people after me.
- Can I help?
- Have you got a car?
- Outside.
Let's get out of here.
Stay close to me.
Not far now.
Near-side door.
- Maybe he didn't see me.
- I wouldn't go ''Banco!'' on that.
Giving up bad habits?
- Where are we heading?
- Nearest post office to contact London.
I know, Feldkirch.
Why are they looking for you?
I suspect they're trying to kill me.
Drive on!
No sign of them yet.
Or of someone saying thank you.
Thank you, Tracy. You've got sharp eyes and beautiful--
Earlobes. What were you doing so near Piz Gloria?
Now I have a new interest in life.
Winter sports? Very wholesome.
Just one winter sportsman, and Papa told me where to find him.
Just keep my mind on your driving.
Good. There it is, James. Hurry.
James!
Shoot at them!
Good girl.
That crowd might discourage them.
Looks like we've hit the rush hour.
We must stop them!
How do we get out?
Knock him out of the way!
I hope my big end will stand up to this.
James! How do we get out?
Keep straight!
- We can get out there.
- If you say so.
We didn't even stop for the prize.
I told you that crowd would discourage them.
That's all we need right now.
Pull in there.
Keep moving. I'll open the doors.
Sorry about the accommodations, contessa.
We should have rung ahead and booked.
If only I'd got through to London.
- At least you'll get another chance.
- But when?
Let's get some rest.
We'll push on as soon as we can.
At least it's dry.
What really went on up there, James?
Her Majesty's Secret Service is still my job.
But there isn't anything you can do about it at the moment, is there?
No.
Then why are you thinking about it now?
I'm not.
I'm thinking about us.
Tracy, an agent shouldn't be concerned with anything but himself.
I understand. We'll just have to go on the way we are.
No.
I'll have to find something else to do.
Are you sure, James?
I love you.
I know I'll never find another girl like you.
Will you marry me?
Do you mean it?
I mean it.
Mr. and Mrs. James Bond.
Of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells.
How about Belgrave Square?
Or the Via Veneto, Rome.
Paris, convenient for Le Touquet.
Monaco, handy for the Rainiers.
I wonder how much they're asking for this place.
The proper time for this is our wedding night.
And that's my New Year's resolution.
- Whatever you say, darling.
- And that is yours.
Good night, Tracy.
Good night, James.
It's not New Year yet.
- James!
- Keep going!
- Simple!
- Good girl.
He had lots of guts.
You three keep going.
Let's head for the trees!
- James!
- Keep going!
Tracy, cling onto me!
A grave deep enough, I think, to prevent even 007 from walking.
Get the girl.
United Nations, sir. Red scrambler.
M here.
Yes, we're standing by as instructed.
I understand.
Thank you, sir.
No decision has been announced yet.
Of course, it's a total news blackout.
But my informant was very plain.
- How plain, sir?
- They're going to buy Blofeld off.
Sit down.
- And the price?
- Amnesty.
A full pardon for all past crimes.
Official recognition of his title...
...when he retires into private life as Count de Bleuchamp.
He seems to set great store by that.
A very curious thing, snobbery.
- When will they conclude the deal?
- Blofeld wants to know...
...the council's decision not later than midnight the day after tomorrow.
That gives us time to get to Piz Gloria first. In force.
No, 007. My instructions are clear.
Destroy the institute and destroy
Blofeld and his virus with it.
It's been rejected as too risky.
Those girls...
God knows how many, let alone where.
If we destroy the center of communication controlling the girls...
...they can do nothing.
I have my orders, you have yours.
Forget it.
The girl who helped me escape, we just leave her?
This department is not concerned with your personal problems.
This department owes her a debt.
She saved my life.
Operation Bedlam is dead.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.
I understand.
Your call to Marc Draco, head of Draco Construction.
- Hello, Draco?
- Yes, who is it?
- James Bond.
- Thank God, James.
I'd like to interest you in a demolition deal...
...that requires aerial activity to install equipment.
Are you sure we're going to find
Teresa when we get up there?
I'm pretty certain. If not, there's a good reason for going anyway.
So you've explained.
Quite a crusade.
It is a time for celebration.
Perhaps, if they agree.
They can do nothing else and you know it, and they know it.
I shall be able to offer you anything your heart could wish for.
Paid for with how many lives?
Oh, come now, Tracy, don't be so proud.
Your own father's profession is not entirely within the law.
His brotherhood also have exotic ways to keep it a closed shop.
Basle approach calling unidentified aircraft.
You're flying in controlled airspace.
We have no flight plan filed on you.
I think some people don't know we're crusaders.
Now, if you're very, very nice to me...
...I could make you my countess.
But I'm already a countess.
Whereas if you displease me, I can promise you a very different estate.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?
There is something on the radio you should hear.
- Excuse me.
- This is Zurich information...
...calling unidentified aircraft.
Over.
This is Zurich information calling unidentified aircraft.
- Well?
- That helicopter is one of three.
- None have answered air control.
- And?
There are suspect aircraft in the vicinity.
-- pilot's name and destination.
Over.
Zurich, this is Foxtrot, Gulf, Sierra, leading Red Cross helicopter flight...
...carrying Red Cross medical supplies to Italy.
What's the trouble? Over.
We have no record of your flight plan.
Over.
I repeat, we have no record of your flight plan or registration. Over.
Then your registrations must be out-of-date. Over.
Foxtrot, Gulf, Sierra, this is Zurich information.
You must land at Zurich and report.
I say again, land at Zurich and report.
- Over.
- Do you wish to commit murder?
I told you, this is a mercy flight...
...carrying blood plasma and emergency equipment...
...for the victims of the Italian flood disaster...
...at Rovigo.
I repeat:
Mercy flight. You understand me?
- Gulf, Sierra?
- Yes?
Zurich. Very well, you may proceed. Out.
You see? It is nothing.
Seems to have settled it.
In case one or both of us is delayed on the way home...
...it's better to have a rendezvous for later.
Before we start getting sentimental,
I think we're being followed.
I've been thinking about your proposition.
Please, tell me more.
This is military air control.
There is no record of your mission.
Alter course to Zurich and land.
Fighters have been dispatched to intercept you. Over.
I suggest you check your records again, carefully. Over.
I repeat, return to Zurich and land. Over.
Check with Geneva. Check with the Red Cross in Geneva.
Meanwhile, call off your air force.
- It is making my passengers sick.
- Foxtrot, Gulf, Sierra...
- ...you are carrying passengers?
- Of course I am.
Distinguished representatives of the world press.
They've had enough of your nonsense. So have I.
Over and out.
There's a lot more to tell, but there will be plenty of time later.
Take me to the Alpine room.
Are you unhappy here?
I want to see the dawn.
So poetic a pleasure.
What were all the world's charms to mighty Paris...
...when he found that first dawn in the arms of his Helen?
When do you expect the signal accepting your terms?
Any time before midnight tonight.
''Thy dawn, O master of the world, thy dawn.
For thee, the sunlight creeps across the lawn.
For thee, the ships are drawn down to the waves.
For thee, the markets throng with myriad slaves.
For thee, the hammer on the anvil rings.
For thee...
...the poet of beguilement sings.''
- Helicopters! An attack!
- Get all positions covered!
Look to the girl!
- Tracy! Darling!
- Thank God, Teresa!
James, wait!
Guns make me nervous!
You've done your share.
Get her to safety.
Come on! Let's go!
And you!
Get the circuit set up now!
Let's go!
- All points covered?
- Yes, sir.
All set to blow?
The fuse is set for exactly five minutes and 10 seconds.
The place will be sealed forever.
Will that give the Englishman time to get out?
He knows the schedule.
- Where are you going?
- Where's James?
- He'll join us soon.
- But we can't leave him!
- He doesn't need help!
- I won't go without him!
You'll have to!
Spare the rod and spoil the child!
Five, four, three...
...two, one. Now!
He's branched off.
Never mind that.
Go and get the brandy, huh?
Five-star Hennessy, of course.
Your Royal Highnesses...
...my lords, ladies and gentlemen...
...the toast is, the bride and bridegroom:
Mr. and Mrs. James Bond.
- Good luck, Teresa.
- Thank you.
Anyway, it's a pleasure...
...to meet the man who cost me three of my best operatives.
Yes, November '64, the bullion job.
You even got away with quite a chunk of the haul. Tell me...
Congratulations, 007.
I must confess that I've sometimes thought you a little--
- Irresponsible?
- That's exactly the word. Thank you.
- This time, my boy, I can't complain.
- Nor can I.
- Teresa?
- Yes, Papa?
Look, James, I know that we haven't always exactly seen--
Anyway, don't forget, if there's anything you ever need--
Thank you. This time I've got the gadgets, and I know how to use them.
Remember, obey your husband in all things.
- You promise me?
- But of course I will.
As I always obeyed you.
Of course. Well, James,
I wish you luck.
For the first and last time.
Remember?
An old proverb: ''Her price is far above rubies, or even your million pounds.''
Just because you are Mrs. Bond...
- ...don't forget my birthday.
- Have I ever?
Both of you, maybe all of you.
Come on, James.
Very happy. Be happy, my darling.
Come on.
On your way.
- Goodbye!
- Drive carefully!
Miss Moneypenny, what would you do without me?
I always cry at weddings.
007 never had any respect for government property.
You know, I haven't given you a wedding present yet.
I had an idea about that.
Three girls, three boys.
- Pleased?
- Not bad for a start.
But, darling, now we have all the time in the world.
Say it with flowers!
He's got a point. We do look like an ad for a flower shop.
That reminds me, I didn't even send you flowers.
Anyway, you have given me a wedding present.
The best I could have: A future.
Mrs. Bond, shut...
...up. And don't eat it all at once.
- He loves me--
- Instinctively.
- Infuriatingly.
- Intensely.
In...
- In...
- In...?
Indubitably.
First a boy, and then a girl.
It's Blofeld!
It's Blofeld.
It's all right.
It's quite all right, really.
She's having a rest.
We'll be going on soon.
There's no hurry, you see.
We have all the time in the world.
[Inspiring music]
He was a good man, davie.
Yes, sir.
Here's the key to the schoolhouse, sir.
Thank you.
I'll go with you as far as the ford.
Yes, sir.
Well, davie, are you sorry to leave this place?
I could answer that, mr. Campbell,
If i knew where i was going or what was likely
To become of me.
'Tis a good place indeed.
But then i've never been anywhere else.
[Chuckles]
And now that my father's dead, i'm-
I'm no nearer to him here
Than i would be in the kingdom of hungary.
To tell you the truth, sir, if i knew i was going
Where i could better myself,
I should be leaving with a good heart.
Very well, davie.
Then it behooves me to tell you your fortune.
Or so far as i may.
You see, davie, when your father,
That worthy christian man, began to sicken for his end,
He gave me this letter, which he said was your inheritance.
"So soon as i am gone," said he,
"Give my boy this letter in his hand
"And start him off for the house of shaws near cramond.
It was there i came from," he said.
"And it's there it befits my boy should return."
The house of shaws?
What did my father to do with the house of shaws?
Who can say?
But the name of the family is the name you bear-
Balfour of shaws.
"To the hand of ebenezer balfour, esquire, of shaws,
"In his house of shaws,
This will be delivered by my son, david balfour."
Mr. Campbell, if you were in my shoes,
Would you go?
Indeed i would.
A lad like you should get there in but two days of walk.
Good-Bye, mr. Campbell.
May god be with ye.
And, davie!
Yes, sir?
Mind you do not shame us
In yon great house with all those domestics,
Upper and under.
Show yourself as nice and circumspect as any.
Yes, sir.
And as for the laird.
Remember, he's the laird.
I'll say no more.
It's a pleasure to obey a laird
Or should be to the young.
Of course, sir.
Good-Bye, sir.
Good-Bye, davie.
[Rattling]
Which way is cramond?
Down the road, mannie.
Have you heard of a house by there
That they call the house of shaws?
Aye.
'Tis a great house?
Aye.
But the folk that are in it?
Folk?
Are you daft?
There's no folk there
To be called folk.
Not mr. Ebenezer balfour?
Ou, ay, there's the laird, to be sure,
If it's him you're wanting.
It's none of my affairs,
But you seem a decent-Spoken lad.
And if you'll take a word from me,
You'll steer clear of the shaws.
Mother.
Which way is the house of shaws?
The house of shaws?
- Aye.
- That is the house of shaws.
Blood built it,
Blood stopped the building of it,
And blood will bring it down.
And if you see the laird,
Tell him what you hear-
That this makes the 1, 219th time
That jennet clouston has called down her curse
On his house, byre, and stable,
Man, guest, or master,
Wife, miss, or bairn!
Black be their fall.
[Tapping]
[Birds cawing]
[Knocking]
[Coughs]
Is anybody there?
[Coughs]
Is anybody there?
Is mr. Balfour there?
Open this door.
You can hear me!
Open this door!
[Creaking]
It's loaded.
I'm here with a letter to mr. Ebenezer balfour.
Then put it down on the doorstep, and be off with ye.
I will not.
'Tis a letter of introduction.
And i will deliver it to mr. Balfour's own hands.
And who are yourself?
A balfour just as he is-
David balfour.
Is your father dead?
Aye, he'll be dead no doubt,
And that'll be what brings you to my door.
Enter the kitchen, will ye?
And touch nothing!
Are you sharp-Set?
Can you eat that drop of porridge?
But no doubt that's your own supper.
Oh, i can do fine wanting it.
I'll take that bit of small beer.
It slockens my cough.
Now give me alexander's letter.
How did you know my father's name?
It'd be strange if i didn't,
For he was my born brother.
And little as you seem to like me
Or my house or my good porridge,
I'm your born uncle and you, davie,
My born nephew.
So the letter's for me and for nobody else in the world.
Now sit down and fill your belly.
Do you ken what's in this?
The seal wasn't broken.
You saw that yourself.
Aye, but what brought you here?
You'll have had some hopes, no doubt.
Aye, sir.
When i heard that i had kinfolk well-To-Do,
I did think they might help me in life.
But i want no favors that are not freely given.
Hoot-Toot, do not fly up in the snuff at me.
If you're done with that bit of porridge,
I could just take a sup of it myself.
Has your father been long dead?
Three weeks, sir.
He was a secret man, alexander-
A secret, silent man.
He'll never have spoken much of me?
I never knew he had a brother
Till you told me so yourself.
Dear me.
And the house of shaws?
He never spoke of that either, i dare say.
Not so much as the name.
To think of that.
Strange nature of a man.
And now come away to your bed.
Yes, sir.
[Key rattling]
We'll agree fine yet, davie, my man.
I'm just as glad i let you in.
Good night, dear davie.
Will you leave me no candle?
Did nobody ever tell you that a candle costs money?
[Key rattles]
Ebenezer balfour, esquire... of shaws... in his house of shaws.
Your breakfast's ready!
Bond, wholesome food porridge.
And cheap.
Aye, and cheap.
I don't imagine that you'd take small beer
To your breakfast.
I do, but don't put yourself out.
No, no, i'll deny you nothing
In reason.
[Chuckling] you see, davie,
You came to the right place
When you came to your uncle ebenezer
For i have a great notion of the family,
And i mean to do right by ye.
But i'm a poor man.
Never forget that.
For my father sinfully wasted the estate
When he began to rebuild this house.
Mind ye, i sent the workmen packing ten minutes
After he was dead, but it was too late, davie.
It was too late.
That's not how jennet clouston tells it.
Jennet clouston?
And what did jennet clouston say?
That blood built it,
Blood stopped the building of it,
And blood will bring it down.
And she told me to tell you
That this makes the 1,219th time
That she called down a curse on your house.
A witch. A proclaimed witch.
That's every day since i had her sold up.
I'm off to see the session clerk.
I'll have her roasted in red peats
Before i'm by with her.
There's too much here.
I can't leave you by yourself in the house.
I'll have to lock you out.
If you lock me out,
It'll be the last you see of me in friendship.
David, this is not the way to win my favor.
Sir, with a proper reverence for our common blood,
I do not value your favor at the penny's purchase.
And if you are all the uncle
And all the family i have in the world,
I wouldn't buy your liking at those prices.
Well-Ell, we must bear and forbear.
I'll not go.
That's all that's to be said of it.
[Lightning crashes]
[Thunder]
When my father was little,
Was he quick at his book?
Alexander?
[Chuckles]
Not him.
I was far quicker myself.
I was a clever chappie when i was young.
I found this on the shelf.
"To my brother ebenezer
On his fifth birthday."
In my father's own hand.
Yet you are the laird of shaws.
So wasn't he younger than you?
What made you ask that?
Because if he wrote this when he was only four,
He must have been very quick indeed at his book.
And take your hands from my jacket.
This is no way to behave.
You shouldn't speak to me of your father, davie.
That's where the mistake is.
He was all the brother that ever i had.
[Thunder]
Nevertheless, there are things that i don't understand.
And whether you like me to speak of my father
Or whether you do not,
I intend to find them out.
So be it, davie.
So be it.
Go on up there.
At the top of the tower, there's a wee room
With a chest in it.
Bring the chest down to me.
There are papers in it that'll tell you everything.
Very well.
Uh, do not take the light.
I'm not well, davie.
I'm an old man, and i'm not well.
Get along, lad.
Get along.
[Gasps]
[Thunder]
Are you alive?
Oh, man, are you alive?
That i am, and small thanks to you.
The wee bottle on the mantelpiece.
[Whimpers]
It's the trouble.
The trouble, davie.
It's the heart.
[Hiccups]
You're quite well enough to speak now.
So follow on with your explanation.
And now you have one more thing to explain-
Why you tried to kill me.
For pity's sake, let me go to my bed, davie.
I'll tell you everything the morning.
As sure as death i will.
Very well.
But this is where you'll sleep.
- Good night to ye.
- Good night, uncle ebenezer.
[Locks door]
[Knocking at door]
What cheer, mate?
Here's a letter for your master.
From captain hoseason himself.
And who might captain hoseason be?
Never heard of hoseason,
Captain of the brig covenant?
And a man what minds for nothing
In heaven nor on earth.
Why, he'd crack on all sail into the day of judgment, he would.
And i'm his cabin boy and proud of it.
You see, davie,
I have a trading venture with this man hoseason.
And now he writes that he's ashore at queensferry
And ready to sail.
Look for yourself.
He wants to meet me at the inn
For we have business to settle.
So have we.
And ours comes first.
No, no, davie man, do not be hasty.
For after all that's come and gone,
I doubt if you would believe me upon my naked word.
Your doubt is right.
But, you see, there he writes
Of mr. Rankeillor, the lawyer.
Now after we're done at the inn, we'll jog on to mr. Rankeillor,
And there's a man you will believe.
For he's lawyer to half the gentry in these parts-
An old man, forby, highly respected,
And he knew your father.
Very well.
We'll go to the inn
And directly afterwards to mr. Rankeillor.
What do they think of mr. Ebenezer here abouts?
That he's a wicked old man.
Many would like to see him dancing at the end of a rope.
Jennet clouston, all the other folks
He's hurried out of hearth and home.
He was a fine young fellow once,
But that was before the report went out about mr. Alexander.
Mr. Alexander?
What was the report about mr. Alexander?
Only that ebenezer killed him.
You never hear that, man?
What would he kill him for?
Just to get the place.
The house of shaws?
No other place that i ken.
Then my--Then alexander was the eldest son.
Indeed he was.
What else would he have killed him for?
Master davie, your uncle tells me great things of you.
I wish i was for longer here
That we might make the better friends.
But you must come aboard my brig for half an hour
Till the ebb sets and drink a bowl with me.
Well, i'm on my way to mr. Rankeillor, the lawyer.
And so is my uncle.
Aye, he passed me word of that.
But the boat'll set you ashore at the town pier.
Rankeillor's... take care of that old fox.
He means mischief.
Come on board till i can get a word with ye.
We must be fast on board.
Welcome to my ship, mr. Balfour.
And now let me show you the lie of her.
Mind ye, she's only a small, trading boat,
Sailing for the most part from here to the carolinas.
But she's home to me, mr. Balfour.
That's my berth.
Now since the mates are never off duty together.
They use the other- Turn and turnabout.
Here i keep all the valuable of the ship stores-
Brandy, for instance.
But to tell the truth,
My first mate's only too fond of that.
In here, pistols, powder, and shot.
You never know what sort of ruffian
You may ship up on your crew.
- Over here--
- Wasn't there something
You were going to tell me?
Something about my uncle?
Was there, young man?
Was something about my old friend mr. Ebenezer?
Where is my uncle?
That's the point, young man.
Come back!
Come back!
Bring back that boat!
[Creaking]
Take the boy out of this hole
And put him in the forecastle.
Why should he not bide here?
After what you did to him
And the fever he has in consequence,
It wouldn't be beyond him to die in a place like this.
Well, you was paid to get rid of him, wasn't you?
Mr. Shaun, you've been with me three cruises,
And if you'd spent less time at the bottle,
You might have got to know me.
I'm a stiff man, and i'm a dour man,
But i'm a man of principle.
And i'll have no part in murder.
Very noble of you.
Besides, if he's dead when we reach the carolinas,
He'll not be worth a scotch shilling.
Mr. Shaun, take the boy to the forecastle.
Drunk or sober, you'll obey my orders.
Take him to the forecastle,
And be quick about it.
Told you that's where he should have been
In the first place.
One day, he'll go too far.
Look. I'm sick and tired of being knocked about.
And, one day, i'm gonna use it.
Well, who got you into this?
My uncle.
Gah, i'm lucky.
Don't have no relations at all.
I had a father once, though.
I remember he kept a jackdaw in the parlor
What could whistle rule, brittania!
But i ain't heard tell of him or the jackdaw
Since i went to sea when i was nine.
I'd tell you how long ago that was,
But i lost count.
Come on.
Can you walk, matey?
I think so.
Lean on me.
I'm little, but i'm strong.
What did your uncle want to get rid of you for?
I don't know the whole fact of it yet.
But he's a crafty, old miser who's stolen an estate
That doesn't belong to him.
Who do it belong to?
Me.
And when i get out of here, i'll be rich.
Well, ain't that lucky.
But you know something, matey, it may be a longish time.
Didn't you hear what they said about the carolinas?
It's as plain as the nose on your face.
The captain's planning to sell you off as a 20-Pounder.
A 20-Pounder?
You know what they is.
Indentured servants on the plantations.
Yes, matey,
You may be rich,
But you'll be hoeing tobacco in the carolinas
For the next seven years.
Mr. Balfour, you mustn't think i hold anything
Against you personally.
An uncle must be judge of what's best for his nephew,
For the ways of providence are inscrutable.
Very well.
If you wish-
[Indistinct arguing]
Mr. Shaun!
Mr. Shaun!
[Boy screams]
I knew it would come.
Mr. Shaun has done for him at last.
Mr. Balfour... mr. Balfour, move your berth aft.
You'll serve in the deckhouse in his place.
You were not here before.
There was another boy.
Yes, sir.
I thought so.
The boy is dead, mr. Shaun.
The boy is dead?
That was the other boy.
The other boy's dead.
[Glass shatters]
You sot and you swine,
Do you know what you've done?
You've murdered the boy.
Balfour, put him in his bunk.
Go on.
Do as i say.
He made me throw away a bottle of brandy,
And there's no sense in that.
Here, get me another one from the locker over there.
Balfour, this night's work must never be known.
The lad went overboard, that's it.
That's what the story is.
And i'd give five pounds out of my pocket
If it were true.
[Snores]
Listening for the breakers.
We're not past the hebrides,
And weather like this you don't see in ireland,
You hear it.
Look out!
Starboard!
Hard to starboard.
Hard to starboard, sir.
A fishing boat from the shore.
We must have cut her in two.
What were they about on a night like this?
It's no use lowering a boat.
There's a man here on the bowsprit.
When we struck, her stern went in the air.
He must have jumped for the bowsprit.
There's something strange about this.
That's no ordinary fisherman.
Good evening to you, captain.
It seems to me you keep a poor lookout on this ship.
I could say the same about the crew of your boat.
You have nothing against them, sir.
They were my friends,
And now they're at the bottom of the sea.
You have a scottish tongue in your head,
But the french king's uniform on your back.
You see ill in that, sir?
Now there's no need to do a mischief
Before you see the need of it.
There's many a highland gentleman
Who fought for prince charlie in the year '45
And, when he was beaten, followed him to france.
Are you one of us, captain?
No, sir.
I'm for king george, i'm a true-Blue whig,
And i thank god for it.
But for all that, i can be sorry to see a man
With his back to the wall.
David.
Very well, i'll be plain with you.
I was on my way back to france,
And there was a french ship
Cruising here to pick me up,
But we missed in the fog.
And if i get into the hands
Of any of the red-Coated gentry,
Very likely it'll go hard with me.
So if you can take me to where i was going,
I'll reward you highly for your trouble.
To france?
No, sir, that i cannot do.
But to set you ashore where you came up from...
[coins clinking]
Now we might talk about that.
Half of what's here, and i'm your man.
The money's not mine.
It belongs to my chief.
And i wouldn't use it to buy my carcass any too dearly.
30 guineas if you set me on shore at the linnhe loch.
You can take it if you like, or do your worst.
And if i hand you over to the red coats?
You'll be making a fool's bargain.
My chief has forfeited, and his estates are in the hands
Of the man from hanover that they call king george.
And his officers collect the rents or try to,
Because, for the honor of scotland,
The tenants have not forgotten their chief in exile,
And they send their rents to him under the nose of king george.
And this is it--The money king george is looking for.
So, you see, sir,
You could bring it within reach of the government-
How much of it will come to you?
Little enough to be sure,
If they knew whose money it was.
But i think, if i was to try,
I could hold my tongue about that.
And i'll have you there too.
Play me false, and i play you cunning.
If a hand is laid upon me,
They'll know what money this is.
Very well.
What must be must.
30 guineas and done.
Here's my hand on it.
And mine.
[Door opens and shuts]
Well, boy, doubtless this is the first time
You've seen a wicked rebel.
Aye, sir.
By your long face, you should be a whig.
I am for king george, my lawful king.
He's not the--Well, we won't quarrel about that just now.
Your bottle's dry.
It's hard if i'm to pay
30 guineas to be denied a dram
On the back of it.
I'll fetch the key, sir.
It's not an easy thing with no pistols with us,
Only our cutlasses.
And the man has a look of a fighting man.
I take your meaning, mr. Shaun,
But i'll give you my word.
You'll get your finger on half the guineas in his purse.
Does that satisfy you?
Aye.
Better where he is.
He hasn't room to use his sword.
We'll keep the man in talk.
Well, what is it?
The gentleman's seeking a dram,
And the bottle's out.
Very well.
- David.
- Yes, sir?
Do you know where the pistols are?
In the locker by the other door.
You see, david, that wild highlander
Is a danger to my ship,
Besides being a foe to king george, god bless him.
Now the trouble is that all our firelocks
Are in the deckhouse under this man's nose,
Likewise the powder.
Now, if we were to go in and take them,
He might fall to thinking.
But a lad like you might snap up
A powder horn and a pistol or two
Without remark.
If you can do it cleverly,
I'll bear it in mind
When it'll be good for you to have friends-
And that's when we come to the carolinas.
Aye, sir.
One of our good captain's pipes
And his excellent carolina tobacco.
There's no other way, sir.
I have to tell you.
Tell me what?
That they're planning to kill you.
But it's true, sir.
They're all murderers here.
They've murdered a boy already,
And now it's to be you.
Would you stand with me?
I will.
It'll be the two of us against the whole ship.
I'll stand with you, sir.
Well, then.
What's your name?
David balfour... of shaws.
And mine's stewart.
Alan breck stewart.
Now, mr. Balfour, let's look to our defenses.
I have my sword and my dirk.
You'll have to make do with a sailor's cutlass.
I have the key to the pistols, sir.
Good. Then you can fight like a gentleman.
Now there are two doors, four windows,
All weather-Boarded.
You bolt your door... yes, sir.
And i'll open mine.
Why open it?
Now don't argue with me so soon, mr. Balfour.
That door is the best part of my defenses.
I only have one face,
And if the door is open
And my face towards it,
The best part of my enemies will be in front of me,
Where i would always wish them to be.
Your post is at the window.
And don't fire to this side unless they get me down.
I'd sooner have ten foes in front of me
Than one friend cracking pistols at my back.
This is a strange return of a hospitality.
Sir, i am come of kings.
And i bear the king's name,
And this sword has slashed the heads off more whigs
Than you have toes to your feet.
So call your vermin to your back... and fall on.
I'll mind this, balfour.
Now let your hand rule your head,
For the grip is coming.
Mr. Shaun, you will attack to the open door
Where no doubt they expect the main battle.
While you engage them there,
My men will break through the door on the other side.
As you will.
Ye afraid, mr. Balfour?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, i am.
Bravely said.
There's many a fine, handsome gentleman
That wouldn't a-Dared to say it.
Very well, mr. Shaun.
Come on.
[Shouting]
That's him that killed the boy.
Look through your window.
Right, break it down.
[Gunshot]
[Moans]
[Gunshots]
Hey, come back!
Come back!
I've settled two.
How about you, mr. Balfour?
- I think i winged the captain.
- Good.
That makes three.
There's not enough blood let.
They'll be back again.
[Muffled whispering] i can hear them.
I think they're planning something.
That's just what we want.
Unless we can give them a distaste of us
And be done with it,
There'll be neither sleep for you nor me.
[Creaking]
They're all around us.
Aye, mr. Balfour.
And this time, they'll be in earnest.
[Whistle blows]
[Gunshot]
[shouts]
Mr. Balfour, mr. Balfour!
Mr. Balfour!
Get below, you scurvy rats.
[Laughs]
[Footsteps]
Man, am i not a bonny fighter?
David balfour, i love you like a brother.
[Sobbing]
Oh, is it because you've killed a man?
I ken what you're feeling.
I remember it myself.
When i was an age to you.
It's rest you're needing.
I'll take the first watch
And clean up this filth.
There's one thing i mislike about your tale
Than the villainy of your uncle,
And that is that your minister has the name of campbell.
Mr. Campbell.
But he's a man you'd be proud to give your hand to.
I'd give nothing to a campbell,
Unless it were a leaden bullet.
If i was dying, i'd crawl on my knees
To a window to get a shot at one.
What ails you at the campbells?
I'm an appine stewart.
And the campbells have long harried and wasted
The people of my name.
Aye, and taken lands of us out of treachery
And never with a sword.
Heh. What happened
When the clans were broken at culloden,
And the good cause came down, and the horses ran up
To their fetlocks in the best blood of the north,
And my chieftain had to flee like a deer in the mountain
And his lady and his bairn?
And the campbells stripped him of his land
And plucked the weapons out of the hands of the clansmen
That held arms for 30 centuries.
Aye, and the very clothes from their backs,
For now it is a crime to wear a plaid tartan.
And a man may be cast into jail
That he has a kilt about his legs.
But the one thing they couldn't kill
Was the love they bore their chieftain.
These guineas are proof of that.
Then there steps in a campbell-
Red-Headed colin roy that men call the red fox.
He gets a paper from king george
That he's an agent in the lands of appin.
And when he finds out
The tenants are sending their rents overseas
To their chieftain, the black campbell blood in him runs wild.
Oh, will a stewart get a piece of bread
That i cannot prevent it.
So he's sending for lawyers and papers and red coats
To stand at his back.
And soon the kindly folk of the country
Will have to pack and tramp,
Each father's son from his father's home
And from the lands where he was fed and bred
And played as a lad.
[Chuckles]
The red fox-- If ever i get you at gun's end,
The lord have pity on you.
I mean that, david.
If a day comes when i have time and leisure
For a bit of hunting, there's not enough heather grows
In scotland that can hide him from my vengeance.
It seems to me, mr. Stewart,
That you're neither very wise nor very christian
To blow off so many words in anger.
For they will do the man you call the red fox no harm
And yourself no good.
That's a good observe,
Barring that about christianity,
Of which my opinion is quite otherwise,
But i'm much of your mind.
Opinion here or opinion there,
It's a known fact that christianity forbids revenge.
Aye?
It's easily seen that a campbell taught you.
It'd be a very convenient world for them and their sort
If there was no such thing
As a lad with a gun behind a heather bush.
[Chuckles]
But you're a grand man in a fight, david,
Even though you have whig blood in you.
These i had from my father.
And he from his father before him.
Here, a keepsake for the fight we made together.
And wherever you go, if you show that button,
The friends of alan breck will come around you.
Balfour, tell your friend i'm here for a parlay.
Will you give me your word you'll try no treachery?
I do.
I give my word.
Put those things up.
Have i not passed my word?
I doubt not your word is breakable.
Last night, you haggled and argle-Bargled
Like an apple-Wife, then gave me your word
And your hand to back it,
And you ken well what was the upshot.
Be damned to your word.
You'll get little good by swearing.
And there are other things to speak of.
You've made a sore hash of my brig.
I've not men enough to work her.
There's nothing left but to run south to glasgow
For fresh hands.
And you'll have a bonny tale to tell there.
A dozen tarry sailors on the one side,
A man and a halfling boy up on the other.
Oh, it's pitiful.
Tell 'em what you like.
But first set me ashore as we agreed,
And my friend too,
For i intend to see him on his way to his estate.
How can i put you ashore?
My first officer's dead.
You know best how.
There's none of us acquainted with this coast.
And it's one very dangerous to ships.
You want the 30 guineas or do you not?
If you do, set me on dry land at appine,
Morven, or ardgour-
Anywhere within 20 miles of my own country,
Excepting the country of the campbells.
That's a broad target.
If you miss it, you must be as feckless
At sailoring as i found you at fighting.
It's to risk my brig and your lives along with her.
Take it or want it.
As you will.
But if i'd lost less money on this unchancy cruise,
I'd see you with a rope's end before i risked my ship.
Are you acquainted with this coast?
I've been picked up and set down in it often enough.
Then come and help me pilot my ship.
Is this one of your tricks?
Do i look like tricks?
My brig's in danger.
What do you call that?
The sea breaking on the reef.
So you know where the reef is.
What better do you want?
Aye, if it was the only one.
If i'd known about these reefs, it's not 30 guineas,
No, nor yet 300 would have made me risk my brig
In such a stone yard.
I'm thinking that's what they call the torran rocks.
Are there many of them?
I'm no pilot, but it sticks in my mind
That there's ten miles of them.
Is there a way through them?
Doubtless, but where?
It also runs through my mind
It's clearer in under the land.
Very well, sir.
We'll try your way of it.
But i may as well trust to a blind fiddler.
Pray god you're right.
Pray god i am.
Hard to port!
Hard to port.
Hard to port, sir.
This is not the kind of death i fancy.
You're not afraid, are you?
No, but i'm more of a fighting man than a sailor man,
And you'll allow it's a very cold ending.
Clear water ahead, sir!
You were right, sir.
You've saved my brig.
And i'll mind that when we come to clear accounts.
Bring her up a point.
One more reef to leeward.
A point to port.
A point to port, sir.
Easy now.
Easy.
[Gusting wind]
[Wood creaking]
Look out, forward!
Hold on.
Hold on!
[Speaking gaelic]
You're wasting your breath.
I'm no highlander, and i have no gaelic.
[Speaking gaelic]
You mean you're going to steal from that stinking tub.
Don't fuss yourself, for i'll not interfere with you.
[Speaks gaelic] och, no.
I was swept ashore last night
On the other side of the island.
And all i want is someone to guide me to the mainland.
Well, that'll cost you two shillings.
So you do have english.
Only when it's needful.
Did you see anyone from the ship?
- Aye.
- Did any get ashore?
Aye, they went away to the mainland.
A man dressed like a gentleman
With a uniform under his coat?
Aye, there was a great gout like that.
Oh, no two shillings to guide you,
But then you'll be hungry, and i'll have to give you food.
And when i'm gone, maybe someone else will come
And find this wreck of mine
And take what doesn't belong to him.
All together it'll cost you five shillings.
You said two shillings!
Oh, well, find your own way then, manny.
Very well.
Five shillings.
Come then.
There's where you go, manny.
Over the hills and far away.
And where you go too.
I paid you good silver to guide me.
[Speaks gaelic]
I know what will bring your english back.
[Coins rattle] aye, another five shillings,
And i'll lead you to the ferry.
You're a cheat, and you're a liar.
And i'd starve to my death in the mountains
Before i gave you one penny more.
Give me five shillings in my hand.
[Dog barks; gulls cry]
Is it you that keeps a ferry?
Everybody knows that.
I'm seeking somebody,
And it comes in my mind that you may have news of him.
His name is alan breck stewart.
I am very much affronted.
This is not the way
The clan gentleman should behave to another.
The man you ask for is in france,
But if he were in my sporran and your belly full of shillings,
I would not hurt a hair of his head.
[Barks]
Now pick up your dirty money and be off with you.
Yes, sir.
Just a minute.
Are you, by any chance, a shipwrecked man?
Aye.
And have you, by any other chance,
A silver button?
Yes, sir.
Well, i think you might have started
With that end of the stick, whatever.
Now come you with me to my boat,
For i've the word to see you come safe.
Two things i tell you plain, young man.
There is a name you must never take in your mouth,
And that's the name of alan breck.
And there's a thing you must never do,
And that is to offer your money to a highland gentleman.
Well, i've just left one over on the other side
Who wouldn't do anything without it.
There are highland gentlemen and highland gentlemen.
And as you are only a lowlander,
You have not the sense to tell the one from the other.
[Dog barks]
It's the land of appin-
And a hard country for men to care as much about
As the appine stewarts do.
Yonder is duror of appin,
And there you must ask for james of the glens,
Who is brother to the chief.
Your friend is on his way there
And will join you when he can.
When he can?
The noise is that colin roy campbell,
The man they call the red fox,
Is coming with his soldiers to turn the stewarts
Out of hearth and home.
It's a chancy day in appin,
And you must take care to walk softly.
But i'm no jacobite or no rebel,
For i was born a true-Blue whig.
We can none of us help what we were born.
[Jangling]
Well, boy, where are you off to?
To duror of appin, sir.
And if you know it, i'd be obliged
If you'll tell me where i will find james of the glens.
James of the glens.
There's many a man who would think this is an omen.
Here am i on my road to duror
For the job that you ken,
And a young lad waits in a wood
And asks me for james of the glens.
This is an ill subject for jest, mr. Campbell.
Very well.
What does it mean?
Does it mean that james is gathering his people against us?
If you're thinking of me, sir,
I am neither of his people nor of yours,
But an honest subject of king george,
Owing no man and fearing no man.
Very well said, sir.
But if i may make so bold,
What does an honest man so far from his country?
And why does he seek james of the glens,
Brother to the chief of appin?
I have power here, sir, i must tell you.
I am the king's agent
With 12 files of soldiers at my back.
If you'd asked me for james of the glens
On any other day but this,
I should have set you right and bidden you godspeed.
But today when you ask me this,
Today-
Take care, sir.
[Gunshot]
[Gasps]
Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Campbell.
There he is!
Stop that boy!
He's an accomplice, posted here to keep us in talk.
Ten pounds if you take him.
Follow them!
[Gunfire]
- In here.
- Alan.
Come on.
Spread out!
Spread out!
There they go.
[Gunfire]
In here.
Come on.
[Sighs]
Well, yon was a hot burst.
[Groans]
Are you still wearied?
No, i'm not wearied now,
And i can speak.
I liked you very well, alan breck,
But now a campbell man lies dead on the road,
And your ways are not my ways,
And they're not god's ways.
And the long and the short of it is that we must part.
Oh, so that's it.
Well, let me tell you, mr. Balfour of shaws,
If i was gonna kill a man, i wouldn't do it
In my own country and bring trouble on my clan,
Nor would i set out to shoot him without any gun in my hand.
You mean you had nothing to do with it?
I swear by the holy iron
That i had neither art nor part, thought nor act in it.
Such a fuss about a campbell.
They're not so scarce.
That i ken.
Still, you do know who did do it.
Well, i wouldn't conscientiously swear to it.
But he must have run close past you.
Aye, to be sure.
But it's a strange thing that, just at that moment,
I was tying my shoe.
Further more, if i had seen him,
I have a grand memory for forgetting.
And another thing,
It seemed to me that, once or twice,
You exposed yourself to draw the soldiers after us.
That's very likely.
And if you were in the shoes of the lad that fired the bullet,
You'd be a deal obliged for it.
You see, mr. Balfour, them that haven't dipped their hands
In any little difficulty should be very mindful
Of the case of them that have.
And that's the good christianity.
Well, i'll not say it's the good christianity
As i understand it,
But it's good enough.
[Chuckles]
Tomorrow there'll be a fine to-Do in appin.
You and i must be far away.
You and i?
You may have reason to run from the red coats,
But it seems to me that i'm running away
From plain, common sense.
Alan, this is no quarrel of mine.
My quarrel is with my uncle,
And eager i am to get back to settle it.
So let me go my way as an honest traveler.
And if they take me,
I've done nothing wrong.
And i'll trust to the justice of my country.
Justice!
[Laughs]
Man, sometimes i wonder about you.
That was a campbell that was killed.
If you're taken, you'll be tried at inverara,
The head place of the campbells,
With campbells swarming all over the jury box
And the biggest campbell of them all lording it on the bench.
No, david, we're in the highlands,
And if i tell you to run,
Take my word and run.
Mind you, i'll be no small thing.
You'll have to lie bare and hard and brook many an empty belly.
Your bed'll be the moorcocks,
And your life will be like a hunted deer's,
And you'll drag many a weary foot ere we get clear.
But if you ask me if you have another choice,
I'll answer, "none."
Either you take to the heather with me, or--Ssk!
You'll hang.
Well, that's a choice very easily made.
I'll prove myself a gomerel.
The day has found us where we never ought to be-
Glencoe, and a pass they're bound to watch.
Well, now it's no worse to go forward than back.
Spread out on the right!
Down there.
Come on.
Come on. Jump!
Jump!
[Whinnying]
[Metal clacks]
[Shouts in gaelic]
I'm me, alan breck stewart.
Alan breck stewart.
[Speaking gaelic]
We couldn't have fallen better. These are cluny's men.
We're to bide with them until they get word
To their chief that i'm here.
Well, i do not ken who cluny is,
And i do not care for his men,
But i would like finally to get some sleep.
Well, mr. Stewart, come awa', sir,
And bring in your friend that as yet i do not ken the name of.
And how's yourself, cluny?
You do brawly, i hope, sir.
I'm proud to see you.
And to present my friend, the laird of shaws, david balfour.
I'm glad to make the both of you welcome to my house.
It's a queer, rude place for certain,
But since my estates are forfeit and there's a price on my head,
This is one of the burrows that serves me well.
And now we'll take a dram for luck.
And as soon as these rascals of mine have the venison ready,
We'll dine.
And then we'll take a hand at the cards
As every gentleman should.
My life is very dry.
I see little company.
Just sit and twiddle my thumbs
And think of a great day gone by,
And weary for another great day
That we all hope is upon the road.
And so here's a toast to it-
To the restoration of our own true king.
Mr. Balfour was born a whig.
But i believe he's learning.
And now, gentlemen, let's stick a hand at the cards, eh?
- Good.
- Come, mr. Balfour.
Sit you down.
I don't play at cards, sir.
You--You--You do not play?
Why not?
Well, i've no call to judge others,
But i was taught that it was wrong to gamble.
In the devil's name, what kind of whiggish, canting talk
Is this for the house of cluny macpherson?
Sir, i'll put my hand in the fire for mr. Balfour.
I bear a king's name,
And any man i call friend is company for the best.
But now mr. Balfour is tired and must sleep.
In this poor house of mine, i'll have you to ken
That any gentleman may follow his pleasure.
If your friend would like to stand on his head,
He's welcome, but if he or you or any other gentleman
Is not precisely satisfied,
I'll be proud to step outside with him.
Sir, i am very wearied, as alan says.
And what's more, as you're a man who likely has sons of your own,
I may tell you that it was a promise to my father.
Well... say no more.
Say no more.
There's good heather to lie on,
And you may sleep if you must.
Yes, sir.
Have you got any money?
- A little.
- Well, give it to me.
- What for?
- For the loan, man.
Just for a loan.
But why?
We'll need the money.
David, would you begrudge me a loan?
For five guineas... for five guineas, aye.
[Coins clatter]
[Birds chirping]
[Speaks gaelic]
Well, have you rested quite enough, mr. Balfour?
For the news is that the road is clear in the south.
The sooner we start, the better.
The little money we have has a long way to carry us.
I've lost it, and that's the naked truth.
My money too?
You shouldn't have given it to me.
I'm daft when i get at the cards.
Toots-Toots, man, you'll have your money back.
It's not to be supposed that i'd be a hindrance
To gentlemen in your situation.
But can i take it, sir?
For my friend fairly lost my money,
And it puts me in a painful position.
You attack my conduct, sir?
No, but i ask your advice,
For whatever i do, it must be hard on a man with any pride.
Aye, and it's hard on me too,
For you give me the look of a man
Who has cheated poor people to their hurt.
I wouldn't have my friends come to my house
To accept affronts, no, nor yet to give them
As it seems that you're doing.
You see, sir, there is something
To be said on my side-
That gambling is a very poor employ for gentlemen.
[Sighing] mr. Balfour,
You're too nice and covenanting,
But, i must confess, you're a gentleman of spirit.
On my honest word, you may take this money.
It's what i would say to my own son.
And there's my hand on it.
[Chuckles]
Uh, this is no way for two friends
To take a small accident.
I-I have to say i'm sorry,
So it's said.
If you have anything, you better say it.
- No, i have nothing.
- Nothing?
After i said i'm to blame?
Why, of course you're to blame,
And you must bear me out that i never reproached you.
No, you've done worse.
I've long owed you my life,
And now i owe you money too.
You must try to make that burden easy for me.
You ask me to speak.
Well, then i will.
You own that you have done me a disservice.
And now you blame me because i cannot laugh or sing
As if i was glad of it.
And the next thing will be that i'm to go down on my knees
And thank you for it.
You should think more of others, alan breck,
And then perhaps you might speak less about yourself.
And when a friend has passed over an offense
Without so much as one word,
You would be glad to let it lie
Instead of making it a stick to break his back with.
Oh, well, we'll say no more.
[Coughing]
Seems to me that you're ill and can stand no more.
I am ill.
I know i'm ill.
But as to the other,
I can stand anything you can, mr. Stewart.
Further down the burren, there's bound to be a croft
Where i can find you shelter.
And the red coats too?
What silly talk is that?
David, i'm not a patient man.
I never said you were.
Mr. Balfour of shaws,
You're a stiff-Necked, ignorant whig.
And you, sir, are old enough to know your manners.
And from now on, i'll thank you to speak civilly of my king
And of the campbells too, who have never done me any harm.
Have a care, sir.
Do not forget i'm a stewart.
Oh, i know you bear a king's name.
But since i've been in the highlands,
I've seen many of those that do,
And the best i can say of them is this-
That they'd be none the worse for a good washing.
There are some things said that cannot be passed over.
I never asked you to, for i am as ready as yourself.
And i am no blowhard and boaster like some that i could name,
So come on!
David, don't be daft.
I cannot draw on you.
That was your lookout when you insulted me.
David, i cannot, i cannot.
Defend yourself, mr. Stewart.
Defend yourself!
Defend yourself.
Defend-
David!
"Described as 5'10" in height,
"Brown, bushy hair,
"Round-Shouldered, and a little knock-Kneed.
Shabby with an inclination to be genteel."
[Chuckles] so you've finished your sleep at last.
I told you we'd find a croft along the burren.
And by good fortune, donald dhu maclaren is of the right party.
- Alan.
- Hmm?
Can you forgive me for what i've said?
Hoot-Toot, you were so taken with fever,
You didn't know a thing you did.
Besides, that's precisely what i thought i liked about you,
Is the fact that you never quarreled.
Now i find i like you better.
When i heard there was a stranger here,
I did not think i would be so unchancy
As to find an appine stewart.
And when yon door opened,
The last kind of man i hoped to see
Was the son of rob roy macgregor.
Oh, indeed, sir.
Then i must console myself
With the bill i found on the way,
Which tells me that this painful meeting may be turned
To the profit of 100 pounds.
By a macgregor, no doubt.
For your tribe have long held money above honor.
There are words that i could say to that, sir,
But i think i will have heard
That you are a man of your sword.
Unless you were born deaf,
You'd have heard a great deal more than that.
Now when my chief drew steel on a gentleman of your name,
I never heard that it was a macgregor
That got the best of it.
You mean my father, sir, rob roy macgregor?
I wouldn't wonder at it.
My father was an old man,
And the match was unequal.
You and i would make a better pair.
I was thinking of that.
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I've been thinking of a different matter, whatever.
Here are my pipes.
And here are you two gentlemen,
Both acclaimed pipers.
It is an old dispute which one of you is the best.
Here is a broad chance
To settle it.
Well, sir, have you music?
I can play like a macrimmon.
That is a very bold word, sir.
I've used bolder words before this... and against better adversaries.
[Bag pipe music]
That's not very bad, mr. Stewart,
But you show poor device in your warblers.
Me! I'll give you the lie.
Do you own yourself beaten at the pipes
That you seek to change them for the sword?
Well said, mr. Macgregor.
So i'll appeal to donald.
You need appeal to no one, sir,
For it's the god's truth you're a creditable piper.
For a stewart.
Enough.
You can play the pipes.
Make the most of that.
You're a great piper, robin macgregor.
I'm not fit to play in the same kingdom with you.
A while ago, i could have given you a lesson with my sword,
But no more.
It'd go against my heart
To slice a man up that can play the pipes like you can.
[Laughs]
There it is, the old bridge of stirling.
When we get across that, we can throw our bonnets in the air.
We're away from the highlands.
Ah, to have come this far
And be bocked at the last step.
We could set about him.
And have the whole garrison after us at his first cry.
Could we swim across?
I swim like a stone.
But there are boats.
If i set my mind to it, doubtless i could steal one.
No. If you pass the bridge, you can tell no tales,
But if you leave a boat on the other side,
Somebody must have brought it.
And the whole countryside's in an uproar.
Well, there's nothing else for it.
We'll have to go back the way we came
And creep around the head of the river.
Look.
Well?
Did you not observe?
He didn't even turn his head to see
Whether it was a man or a woman,
Which means they're not on the lookout for us here.
They didn't think we'd be such gulks as to cross
Under the noses of the garrison.
David, it's a chief military principle
To go where you're least expected.
So this is where we cross.
Your very humble and obedient servant, madam.
Have you got a twist of tobacco?
For which i'll give you sixpence.
I'll need something to light it with,
So if you've got a tinderbox,
I'll give you a shilling.
But, madam, i'll need something to smoke it in.
So make it two shillings for your pipe.
May god bless you, madam.
What are those for?
I'll tell you, since you seem so inexperienced
In such matters.
Hunted men are always on the run.
- You'll grant that?
- Aye.
So we must seem to be in no hurry at all.
That's what i want this for.
I'll wander up there, and then light it
As slowly as can be.
You saunter by,
And after a while, i follow.
- [Chatter]
- Look at that.
- [Indistinct chatter]
- At least it's not raining.
Hoot-Toot, twice the redcoats, half the risk.
Now he's got someone to talk to,
Why should he fuss himself over us?
Now, david, keep a cool head.
If you lose your courage and take to your heels,
We're both dead men.
And what a time i had.
Didn't we just?
Five weeks in the punishing mountains
And not a thing to show at the end of it.
Fellow by the name of campbell, wasn't it?
I don't know.
One scotsman's just like another to me.
[Chuckles]
But we were supposed to be there
To guard him, so when he got done in, well,
We had to chase off after the two blokes what done it.
You never nabbed either of 'em, eh?
Nah, and couldn't they run?
Like a pair of blooming rabbits.
Took us over half of scotland they did.
I heard they got a reward out for 'em now.
Yeah, yeah, they have.
100 quid for the big one,
And 50 for the little one.
Bloody hell.
Blimey, what i could do with 150 quid.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what i'd do?
Yeah, what?
I'd buy myself a nice, little pub
Right in front of the barracks.
[Laughs] i would.
And i'd sit there out in the sun,
Drinking me own beer from noon onward...
[dog barks; clopping hooves]
Mr. Rankeillor?
Are you mr. Rankeillor, the lawyer?
I am, but i do not know your name nor yet your face.
My name is david balfour, sir.
And i believe i have some rights on the estate of shaws.
David balfour.
And where did you come from, mr. David balfour?
From many strange places, sir.
'Tis six weeks since i started for that door,
But i was kidnapped on the way
By someone who did not want me to reach it.
And who was this villainous person, mr. Balfour?
Someone whom i think you know, sir-
My uncle ebenezer.
Pray come inside.
No, mr. David, your uncle did not steal
The house of shaws.
It came to him in a much more singular way
As the result of a love affair.
- A love affair?
- Yes, mr. David.
Your uncle was not always old,
And, what may surprise you more, not always ugly.
So when he and your father fell in love
With the same young lady,
Oh, he made mighty certain of the victory.
But when instead the young lady chose your father,
He screeched like a peacock.
Well, mr. David, the end of it was
That they came to a sort of bargain.
Your father took the lady, who became your mother,
But he left your uncle ebenezer with the estate.
They talk a lot about generosity,
But i often think the happiest consequences flow
When a gentleman consults his lawyer.
Certainly, your father's hasty decision brought no joy at all
To your uncle ebenezer, as you've seen for yourself.
I have indeed, sir.
Money was all he got out of his bargain.
And he came to think the more of money.
He was selfish when he was young.
He's selfish now he's old.
And the latter end to all this selfishness you know yourself.
Yes, sir, but in all this, what is my position?
Oh, the estate's yours.
Beyond a doubt, your father might give up his own rights.
He couldn't sign away yours.
So the day he died,
You became the laird of shaws.
However, getting possession-
Quite another question.
A lawsuit is expensive,
And a family lawsuit is always scandalous.
But what possible answer could my uncle have?
Well, he would begin, no doubt,
By denying you were his nephew.
How could he?
He as much as admitted it by having me kidnapped.
Very true.
How are we to prove that he had you kidnapped?
Mr. Rankeillor, i do not intend
To haul down my colors and leave my uncle
A fortune that isn't his.
Quite so.
So the only thing to do
Is to make him admit the kidnapping
In front of witnesses.
And just how are you gonna manage that?
Oh, i could not manage it,
And i do not think that even you could,
For it needs a violent man without too much concern
For what is proper and correct.
And for that, sir, i think i know just the man we need.
[Window screeches open]
Well?
[Chuckles]
Have a care with that blunderbuss.
They're nasty things to burst.
Who are ye, and what brings you here?
What brings me here is more your affair than mine.
And if you're sure it's what you'd like,
I'll set it to a tune and sing it to you.
Well, what is it?
David.
I'm thinking i had better let ye in.
I dare say that, but the point is, would i go in?
And i'll tell you what i'm thinking.
I'm thinking it's here upon this doorstep
That we must confer upon this business.
And it shall be here or nowhere at all,
For i'll have you to understand that i'm as stiff-Necked
As yourself, and a gentleman of better family.
Oh, well,
What must be must be.
One step nearer, and you're as good as dead.
A very civil greeting, to be sure.
This is a very chancy kind of a proceeding,
And i'm bound to be prepared.
And now that we understand one another,
You can name your business.
Well, you that are a man of understanding
Will doubtless have perceived that i am a highland gentleman.
My name has no business in my story.
But the country of my friends
Is not very far from the torran rocks.
Well, it seems that there was a ship that went aground there.
A gentleman of my family came upon a lad
That was half-Drowned.
He brought him to, and he and some other gentlemen
Clapped him in an old, ruined castle where,
From that day to this, he's been a great expense to my friends.
Now they, not being so particular about the law
As some i could name,
In finding out the lad owns some decent folk,
Asked me to give you a call and confer upon the matter.
And i can tell you this from the start-
That unless we can agree on some terms,
You're not likely to set eyes on the lad again.
For my friends are not very well off.
I'm not very caring.
He was never a good lad at the best of it,
And i have no call to interfere.
Oh, come on, you wouldn't desert your brother's son.
It wouldn't make you very popular in the countryside.
I'm not just very popular the way it is,
So that's idle talk, my buckie.
[Laughs]
Mr. Balfour, we thought you liked david,
Would pay to get him back.
But it seems that's not the case.
And i'm thinking you've very good reasons
For not wanting him back,
And, instead, you'll pay us to keep him.
That'll put as pretty a penny in our pocket as the other.
I do not follow you there.
Now see here,
You don't want the lad back,
What do you want done with him
And how much will you pay?
Come, sir.
I'm a highland gentleman,
Not a sniveling beggar to kick my heels at your hall door.
Either give me an answer in civility,
Or i'll run three feet of steel in your vitals!
Hey, sir, give me a minute.
I'm trying to be as civil as it's morally possible.
Just tell me what you'll be wanting,
And we'll agree fine.
In two words--Do you want the lad killed or kept?
Oh, kept, kept.
Have no bloodshed, if you please.
That'll be the dearer.
The dearer?
What for the dearer?
Killing is easier and quicker.
To keep the lad will be a troublesome business.
I'll have him kept, though.
I'm a man of principle.
And if i have to pay for it, i'll pay for it.
Ah.
What about the price?
Of course, i'll have to ken first
What you paid captain hoseason.
Captain hoseason?
What for?
- For kidnapping the boy.
- It's a lie!
It's a black lie.
He never was kidnapped.
He lied in his throat that told you that.
Hoseason wouldn't like to hear you say so.
What do you mean?
Was it hoseason that told ye?
How else you think i ken, you stupid, old runt?
Oh, hoseason and i are partners.
We gang shares.
But i'm bound to say you struck a fool's bargain
When you let a man like that sail a man so far forward
In your private affairs.
The point in hand is this-
How much did you pay him?
How much does he say i paid him?
That's my concern.
Well, i do not doubt that he lied.
I don't care what he said.
I tell you that he lied.
And the solemn god's truth is this-
I paid him no more than 20 pounds.
- You paid him 20 pounds?
- Aye.
- To kidnap the lad?
- I swear it.
20 pounds.
Mind ye, i'll be perfectly frank with you.
He was to have the selling of the lad in carolina,
Which would be 20 pounds more,
But not out of my pocket, you see.
Thank you, mr. Stewart.
I think we have just what we need.
Good evening, uncle.
It's a fine night, isn't it?
David, is that you, man?
Yes, it's me, uncle.
Then i have wasted my 20 pounds.
It's a braw new suit, mr. Balfour of shaws.
I don't have just the hang of it yet.
You're none too early, davie.
The tide's on the turn.
I'm waiting for a signal to go aboard.
So you have a ship.
There she is.
The captain's the right party.
I'll be in france within the week.
How about you?
It's all settled and sealed.
[Laughs] to think of it, davie,
Only a week ago, you lay under heaven with an empty belly
And in fear of death.
And now you're the laird of shaws.
I suppose so.
You don't seem very joyful about it.
I'll get used to it.
[Cannon shot]
There's the signal.
- When will you be back?
- [Chuckles]
The highlands will be no safe place
For alan breck for a while.
But, later on, when the noise dies down,
You'll come away one day behind a heather bush
Or watching you from the wood about you.
Well, good-Bye.
Good-Bye, alan breck.
{275}{358}About two thousand years ago|in the time of Cleopatra, queen of Egypt...
{361}{463}The Egyptians talked like this:
{1388}{1468}This language was rather|difficult to understand.
{1471}{1566}So the film you are about to see has|been dubbed into English. However ...
{1569}{1663}due to the fact that dubbing techniques|had not been perfected in this period ...
{1666}{1765}you may notice that the movement of|lips is not always synchronised exactly ...
{1767}{1866}with the words being spoken.
{1873}{2021}And now after this|interesting and instructive prologue, ...
{8782}{8881}...and as for the saying that we Egyptians,|who are the descended from the great...
{8883}{8984}Gods, have built things proudly...|Well it's a disgrace, it's a shame, ...
{8986}{9110}it's absurd, ridiculous and its just|plain silly and there's nothing else ...
{9113}{9261}to add unless it's to say that your|stable is infamous, oh Caesar!
{9275}{9353}But you really do have to face the facts|oh Queen, that Egypt is decadent.
{9362}{9469}My people have built the pyramids, the|tower of Souls and the temples, the Obelix!
{9473}{9612}A long time ago I might add.|- Enough!
{9495}{9594}I Cleopatra, will prove my people aren't|decadent! In exactly three months ...
{9596}{9695}I will have a magnificent palace built|for you, here in Alexandria.
{9705}{9802}Very well then.|If you win your bet I will admit the ...
{9805}{9904}Egyptian people are still powerful.
{9961}{10093}She's a nice girl but her nose is easily|put out of joint, it's a pretty nose too.
{10280}{10367}Edephus! I have summoned you because|you're the best architect in Alexandria, ...
{10370}{10447}not that that is saying very much,|your building crumble.
{10450}{10528}They are the laughing stock for those|that don't live in them.
{10531}{10663}Well you see, actually what I like|to build is pyramids.
{10666}{10753}Silence! you have three months to|make good, you are to build a ...
{10756}{10828}magnificent palace here in|Alexandria for Julius Caesar.
{10833}{10932}What three months?|- If you succeed I'll cover you ...
{10934}{11031}with gold, if not, I will have you|thrown to the crocodiles. Go!
{11034}{11157}Three months! Well I need someone|who can work magic to help me do that.
{11185}{11333}A magician, oh I got it,|I know the very man!
{12090}{12196}I'm training him to carry the menhirs|- In the meantime what about a boar?
{12764}{12885}Where do I find the Druid, Getafix?|- Up that tree, under the mistletoe.
{12892}{12989}Getafix!
{13005}{13102}What a pleasant surprise!
{13290}{13410}Meet my dear old friend Edephus, he's an|Architect from Alexandria.
{13449}{13579}Well I've been told to build a palace|for Caesar within three months, and ...
{13582}{13712}if I don't, Cleopatra will throw me|to the crocodiles.
{13715}{13791}Are crocodiles good to eat Asterix?|- Be quiet!
{13794}{13907}And if you won't help me,|I'll never get it done.
{13910}{14028}Now you mustn't cry Edephus,|I'm coming back to Egypt with you.
{14126}{14196}By yourself? Do you mean it?
{14200}{14274}We're off on a long sea voyage Dogmatix.|- You're not going to take him along!
{14276}{14353}Why not mister Asterix?|- Because he's far too small for such ...
{14356}{14440}a long journey Mr. Obelix,|so you go and pack.
{14444}{14570}Oh sure, I'm just an extra to fill in,|non one ever listens to me.
{14614}{14737}My friends, the best of luck to you and I|hope the sky never falls on your heads.
{14795}{14871}I will now sing a for you a|little farewell tune.
{14875}{14948}Oh no!
{15080}{15154}Philistine!
{15461}{15566}That was me barking, woof woof.|Can't I even bark now?
{15573}{15670}All right you idiot, let Dogmatix|out of the bag.
{15986}{16109}Weight anchor now, send the bags up|- Hoist the bags up
{16381}{16504}In Egypt we'll have to contend|with a lot of difficulties and ...
{16507}{16606}there's always the danger|of meeting pirates.
{16619}{16705}We'll look after the pirates, won't we?|- Oh sure.
{16736}{16810}Ship to starboard!
{16944}{17062}The pirates! The pirates!
{17419}{17567}Yoohoo, yoohoo wait for us|we are coming, yoohoo!
{17786}{17909}Right then me hearties, don't loose your|nerve. We'll comer them, we'll cut ...
{17912}{18035}their throats, we'll have their guts, we|will throw them in, sink the lot of them.
{18083}{18191}Same old drill as usual, wait till a I|give the word then board them.
{18194}{18342}Come on board them!|- Did you say board us?
{18980}{19041}I'll be right with you.
{19209}{19279}I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
{19310}{19358}That's not fair.
{19362}{19410}Did you say board us?
{19732}{19786}Did you say board us?
{20155}{20202}Obelix, come on.
{20337}{20411}Come on let's go.|- Right Asterix, but there's still one ...
{20414}{20562}pirate left up there!|- No, no!
{20739}{20862}You say board us?|-Same old drill as usual boy!
{20957}{21056}And one fine night after a long calm|voyage, unbroken by further incident ...
{21058}{21181}the ship approaches the end|of its peaceful voyage.
{21213}{21286}What's that light on the horizon?
{21292}{21389}That's the tower of Pharaoh, it guides|ship into the harbour, ...
{21391}{21453}we'll be in Alexandria tomorrow.
{21459}{21570}A tower for guiding ships in?|They're crazy these Egyptians.
{22228}{22353}Cleopatra' s bath!|- Queen Cleopatra's bath!
{22405}{22478}Queen Cleopatra's bath!
{22924}{23062}Bring Cleopatra's soap!|- Bring Cleopatra's soap!
{23065}{23177}Bring Cleopatra's soap!
{23760}{23894}Bring Cleopatra's lion!|- Bring Cleopatra's lion!
{23897}{23952}Bring Cleopatra's lion!
{26678}{26801}Oh my Queen, this are my friends from|Gaul, a powerful magician and ...
{26804}{26907}two brave warriors, who have|come to help me in my task.
{26911}{26971}Well get going, you really|don't have much time.
{27027}{27170}If you succeed there will be gold for all,|if not you'll be thrown to the crocodiles.
{27175}{27274}And by the way, I warn you that your rival|Ardefus isn't please that I chose you ...
{27276}{27386}and not him to build the palace and he's|jealous. If you want to know what I think ...
{27389}{27481}he'd love to see you wind up inside...|- A Crocodile
{27486}{27552}That is right. Now go!
{27557}{27646}She's bad tempered but what a pretty nose.|- Yes very pretty.
{27651}{27721}Now I'll take you to my place.
{27783}{27906}That's my work there.|I designed that one too.
{27942}{28025}And that is another one of mine.
{28189}{28263}That was one mine too.
{28330}{28408}And this is my house.|- I might have guessed it.
{28630}{28766}The door is jammed, it's the dampness.|- I'll just give you a little hand.
{28770}{28816}No Obelix!
{28887}{28953}Oh don't scold him the|wood is still too dry.
{29005}{29079}Welcome to my house.
{29438}{29512}Come this way please.
{29514}{29573}Coming Obelix.
{30223}{30271}And this is where I work.
{30321}{30440}Master, the architect Ardefus|demand to see you.
{30444}{30567}My rival, show him in.|- I'll come straight to the point, ...
{30570}{30693}let us build Caesar's palace together.|If we succeed then we divide the gold ...
{30696}{30844}between us, if not, you can be food for|the crocodiles by yourself, after all ...
{30847}{30995}there wouldn't be any need to give|them two when one will do nicely.
{30998}{31121}I refuse, you are a cruel, two-faced|schemer that's what you are.
{31127}{31275}Now get out of my home!|-You'll be sorry for this, you wait, ...
{31279}{31427}and I'll see you later in an alligator!
{31790}{31879}I'll take you to the building site.|- Yes do Edephus, It should be ...
{31882}{31956}interesting to see where you work.
{31962}{32026}Dogmatix!
{33036}{33148}Are they slaves?|- Oh no, those are free workers.
{33152}{33220}They are crazy these Egyptians.
{33824}{33921}This is lunch hour, come and see the|plans for the palace.
{33924}{33996}Why aren't those two stopping?|- They are getting a little overtime.
{34065}{34211}Here are the plans, I designed them.|- I recognise your style.
{34620}{34743}Good people, don't let that wretched|architect Edephus exploit you.
{34746}{34869}You have eaten too much and|you are paid too little, stop work now!
{34872}{34995}Take action against such as|exploiter, leave him in the lurch.
{34998}{35099}Go on strike, go back home!
{35708}{35818}Master the workers have just told me|that they refuse to do any more work.
{35821}{35910}Someone is stirring them up against me.|- But who?
{35913}{35996}Yes, who?|- Ardefus, your rival of course.
{35999}{36146}All this worry makes me feel ill, when the|crocodiles get me, I'll be uneatable!
{36149}{36299}You're eager to make them a good meal.|- Of course, they are sacred crocodiles!
{36299}{36361}After all, they are crazy,|these architects!
{36365}{36464}Let's see what is going on.
{36487}{36569}We refuse to go on working under|this condition, the work is too hard.
{36574}{36629}Right!
{36640}{36786}They don't want to go on working.
{36791}{36877}The work is too hard.
{36884}{36985}Asterix light me a good fire|under that cauldron.
{37241}{37387}No, not for you. You fell in the potion|when you were a baby.
{37391}{37482}Give them a little|demonstration Asterix.
{38285}{38408}It works like a charm.|- Of course, bring your men along, ...
{38411}{38528}a little portion of this magic potion|will do the trick.
{38829}{38902}No!
{39079}{39152}No!
{39225}{39298}No!
{39434}{39538}No!|- How does he manage to recognise me?
{41063}{41186}I must do something and fast. Crewcut!
{41191}{41323}Yes, oh Ardefus my master|- I know that Edephus's expecting stone ...
{41325}{41473}to come down the Nile from the south,|that stone must never arrive.
{41480}{41567}Here is gold, Crewcut for you|to settle this business.
{41574}{41675}I hear you and obey you and|Ardefus my master.
{41937}{42077}Take this gold and make sure that the|stone doesn't reach its destination.
{42081}{42182}Done by Osiris.|Thrown this stones overboard.
{43073}{43188}There's non stone left.|- This is Ardefus's doing.
{43205}{43328}No more stone, no palace,|no palace, the crocodiles!
{43336}{43397}Calm down, we'll get your stone for you.
{43401}{43477}Don't worry, we'll get it back|as soon as we can.
{43481}{43574}I hope, but we've only a month's|time left to finish the palace.
{43578}{43716}They must never come back from their|journey alive. I'm counting on you.
{43721}{43791}They won't ever arrive, oh master.
{43875}{43948}{Y:i}This is slow, too slow
{43959}{44036}Move all the ships to the back and|fasten them together with rope.
{44040}{44092}That's what I like, a little exercise.
{44335}{44416}I must say the boy never|fails to surprise me.
{44873}{44996}There's no much beer or boars here.|- You have to eat what is put before you.
{45143}{45266}Beer for Asterix!
{45839}{45938}Boars and beer for Obelix!
{46697}{46796}Bones for Dogmatix!
{49736}{49859}Look here, I've got one hump,|I'm a dromedary, not a camel!
{49862}{49966}Honest I ask you!
{50679}{50828}Tomorrow we shall go and see the Sphinx|and the pyramids, they are worth a visit.
{50897}{50945}What do you think of that?
{51050}{51198}Dogmatix, Dogmatix, come here!|Come here Dogmatix!
{51205}{51294}Dogmatix, you leave her alone Dogmatix!
{51450}{51549}There must be a great view|from up there
{51565}{51626}Dogmatix, you wait here.
{51917}{51992}Obelix!|- Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!
{52155}{52226}We'd better get out of here, come on.
{52878}{53017}From the top of these pyramids here,|twenty centuries look down on you.
{53137}{53244}There must be a great view from up there.|- Obelix you stay here.
{53247}{53357}Oh pyramids, give me a menhir any day.|- Can't you forget Stonehenge?
{53364}{53490}I wonder if they would let us visit them.|- Yes of course, of course, I'm a guide ...
{53500}{53648}and I can take you noble foreigner|tourist for a visit inside the pyramids.
{53682}{53755}In that case we accept with pleasure.
{53810}{53888}Follow the guide.
{53901}{54000}This is no place for a nice little dog,|wait for me here, Dogmatix, ...
{54005}{54125}and if you're good|you'll get a nice bone.
{54428}{54520}Absolutely fascinating, these pyramids.
{55048}{55147}Dark blue sky told me, noble strangers,|without me you would never get out ...
{55149}{55275}of this labyrinth alive.
{55338}{55486}Come along in here, this room boasts|some magnificent hieroglyphics.
{55566}{55689}You will never get out of here|noble strangers.
{55692}{55811}This room will be you tomb.
{55913}{56012}Very interesting these old carvings.|- Yes, but our first concern is to find ...
{56014}{56068}our way out of here.
{56071}{56135}Non of this would never|have happened inside a menhir.
{56139}{56262}All things considered, Obelix for the|very first time, I'm going to give you ...
{56265}{56413}some of the magic potion.
{56491}{56639}Honest? I'm going to have some magic|potion! La la la!
{56883}{57031}I'm glad I came inside this pyramid.|- Obelix, after you.
{57083}{57156}Can I have a little bit more?
{57429}{57477}Well are you coming?
{57614}{57737}Very interesting, these mazes.
{57786}{57872}How about that door there?|- Can I have a little bit more?
{57876}{57975}No Obelix! No!|- It's just isn't fair! I hardly had time
{57977}{58076}to taste it and now he won't give me|any more, it's not fair!
{58325}{58412}I'm afraid that guide was right, it's|just possible we won't get out alive.
{58498}{58607}I'm sorry for poor Edephus, without us|he won't have his palace finished in time.
{58611}{58734}{Y:i}I'm sorry for Dogmatix that's outside!|- Dogmatix!
{58813}{58952}Dogmatix has tracked us down here thanks|to his nose, so he can find the way out.
{59033}{59114}You'll get two big bones.
{59322}{59395}You'll get lots and lots of bones.
{59519}{59621}Sometimes I think he understands|everything I say to him.
{59625}{59658}Follow the guide.
{60084}{60207}It's magic! You're all wizards.
{60461}{60584}It's magic, they're all magician, they|managed to get out of the Great Pyramid.
{60623}{60722}Those Gauls are really fantastic,|even so they still haven't reached ...
{60724}{60823}Alexandria, they still have to get back|up the Nile, we must stop them somehow.
{60928}{61051}I know just the men you need master.|It's a bold gang of pirates who lost ...
{61054}{61153}their ship on high seas|when they got on the wrong tack.
{61156}{61253}Send them to me.|- They are here master!
{61316}{61439}I'll give you a boat and you will sail|this boat down the Nile. Somewhere ...
{61442}{61565}you'll meet a fleet of ships carrying,|stone if those ships fail to reach ...
{61568}{61716}Alexandria, you will get gold,|lots of gold! Now look you, you board ...
{61723}{61871}them, cut their throats, have their guts|you do them in and then sink them.
{61893}{62006}Same old drill as usual boy.
{62254}{62391}These cruises are such a bore.|I'm bored Asterix!
{62469}{62553}I have the impression that there's|going to be some fun soon, Obelix.
{62557}{62669}There's a fleet of ships carrying|stone dead head.
{62674}{62756}Right then me hearties,|don't loose your nerve.
{62759}{62840}It's full of Gauls! Full of Gauls!
{62842}{62970}Full of Gauls? Full speed astern|let's get out of here, about turn!
{63063}{63162}Obelix, here's something to help you|pass the time, there are pirates up head.
{63167}{63266}Real pirates? Oh goodies, goodies.
{63391}{63521}Yoohoo wait for me!
{63525}{63648}Faster boys, faster!
{63996}{64078}Well I think we can get on|with our journey now Obelix.
{64082}{64203}Ah a bite, I'm not eating that fish.
{64382}{64523}Well, we are on the wrong tack again.
{64537}{64646}You know they are beginning to get me|down a little those Gauls.
{64680}{64828}Very well, if that's how it is,|I have an idea, a great idea.
{64832}{64980}You have an idea master?|- Right, a piece of cake, follow me.
{65204}{65352}Pestilential pastry. poisonous pancake.
{65355}{65416}Yes!|-Murderous bangers!
{65420}{65475}Not bad.|- Viper's venom topped with cream
{65478}{65550}Good!|- Cyanide custard pie.
{65553}{65652}Great!|- Special ice arsenic.
{65654}{65720}Oh yes!
{68829}{68943}A present for you oh Queen!|- Bring it in.
{69077}{69186}The three Gauls sent this cake as a gift|to the Queen of the Queens.
{69190}{69335}How sweet of them, you may thank them|in the name of Cleopatra.
{69342}{69393}My taster, send for my taster.
{69396}{69460}Coming! Coming!
{69467}{69577}Taste, tester.|- With pleasure my Queen.
{69716}{69864}Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!
{69902}{69976}Finally my friends,|you are back at last.
{69987}{70088}And we bought you plenty of stone|enough for you to finish the palace.
{70106}{70180}Gauls, I arrest you|in the name of the Queen!
{70184}{70283}Shall I smash them one?|- No, Obelix you can't, let us see ...
{70285}{70345}what is going to happen next.
{70373}{70489}Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.
{70501}{70591}Gauls you were trying to poison me|with that cake, weren't you?
{70594}{70666}Cake? What cake Queen?|- Throw them into the dungeon ...
{70669}{70737}until I have decided on their fate.
{70767}{70890}There's not a moment to loose,|lets drink this antidote.
{70907}{71006}This potion will neutralise|the effects of the poison.
{71011}{71145}They are just giving the royal|crocodiles their appetisers.
{71148}{71232}Step aside, we are coming out!
{71829}{71932}May we come in?|- Guards, guards seize those three men.
{71985}{72133}Gauls from far, sworn to destroy my power,|I shall show you how a Queen can die.
{72136}{72284}Now is the fatal hour, see how a Queen|can die, here I come, Osiris!
{72302}{72352}Gosh, she's a good actress.
{72356}{72435}No, no, calm down, we simply want to|know what we're being charged with?
{72439}{72509}What you're charged with? With that!
{72512}{72652}Looks like a very good cake.|- Obelix, will you find me a cake knife?
{72667}{72790}May I?|Now cut three pieces of this cake.
{72957}{73008}Three pieces I said!
{73012}{73103}That's right, three!|- Greedy pig!
{73283}{73407}I call that an excellent cake, my Queen,|what was so special about it?
{73413}{73537}Just ask my taster.|- Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!
{73547}{73695}Ah lets see, he's just got a little touch|of indigestion, that's all it is.
{73786}{73934}Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear!|That's much better I'm hungry!
{73940}{74063}I've treated you unjustly, Oh Gauls,|I will set you all free, you may go!
{74070}{74169}Someone must have|wanted to hurt us.
{74171}{74237}Yes but who?|- Ardefus.
{74241}{74302}You mean Edephus's rival?|- Who else?
{74305}{74394}Suppose we pay him a little visit.|- That's just what I was going to suggest.
{74427}{74504}Where does Ardefus live please?|- Ardefus? That way!
{74511}{74600}Here is to our victory Crewcut.
{74603}{74696}The time has come for us to drink|to success.
{76147}{76295}Since you wanted to work on the palace,|we are going to give you your chance.
{76482}{76610}The construction of the palace is going|well, You will have it finished on time.
{76621}{76680}Cleopatra is going to be very pleased.
{76684}{76781}Very pleased. The palace is nearly built|Caesar and you know I think I'm ...
{76784}{76844}going to win that bet Julius.
{76847}{76927}Delighted to hear it, oh my Queen,|simply delighted.
{76980}{77103}I'm shall loose face with Cleopatra.|i was told that her architect Edephus ...
{77106}{77209}was only a nit wit, something odd|is going on here, go and find my spy.
{77311}{77398}Here I am. Here I am.|- Come nearer.
{77402}{77485}Go and see what's going on in|Edephus building site.
{77488}{77583}I want to know why the work|is getting on so fast.
{77592}{77722}Quite a job, hey.
{79197}{79322}Three Gauls? An old druid,|a cunning little one and a fat oaf?
{79328}{79476}Asterix, Obelix and Getafix, those three|men can perform any kind of miracle.
{79487}{79561}I must act now!
{79565}{79674}Send for my Egyptian|mercenaries and quick!
{79757}{79905}Hail Caesar, those that are to serve you|at reduced rates, salute you.
{79951}{80091}You 're to get onto Edephus's building|site, without anyone seeing. Then you ...
{80095}{80243}are to knock over the cauldron of magic|potion, and you're to get hold of that ...
{80246}{80388}Gaulish druid, a bag of gold if you are|successful. Get moving, by Jupiter!
{80392}{80540}We are moving oh Caesar, by Osiris.
{80953}{81061}I'll see about that cauldron, you two|take care of the druid.
{81071}{81154}We get it brother!|- Okay brother!
{81265}{81413}If that potion is all that it's supposed to|be, I won't be sharing that bag of gold.
{82015}{82133}Hey look at that, who are you and where|is our druid Getafix gone?
{82233}{82328}Julius Caesar sent us to capture your|famous druid.
{82335}{82444}But our big brother has double-crossed|us to get all the reward for himself.
{82449}{82597}Without the magic potion, without Getafix|we are lost, the sacred crocodiles will...
{82620}{82754}Lets go and get our druids back.|- All right Asterix.
{82809}{82935}Dogmatix I'm leaving you here to|guard the building site, watch out.
{83077}{83195}One of the mercenaries is back, Caesar!|- Send him in.
{83214}{83292}Mission accomplished oh Caesar!
{83295}{83441}You have deserved well Caesar mercenary|here is the reward I promised you.
{83445}{83575}Have this troublesome druid locked up,|I want him thrown into the dungeon.
{83617}{83765}I'm the hottest, I'm the|richest, I'm the...
{83837}{83920}Where is our druid?|- Caesar has had him shut up in the ...
{83923}{83997}dungeon of the palace, please don't|beat me anymore.
{84074}{84138}Coming Obelix.|- Yes Asterix.
{84167}{84315}It's big brother. Big brother, junior|and I want a word with you.
{84371}{84453}I only hope we'll be able to find our|poor old druid.
{84457}{84591}All these old dungeons are the same.|It's just as easy to get in as it is to get out.
{84604}{84684}Halt, you can't come in.|- So we can.
{84687}{84810}May I Obelix, if you don't mind.
{84945}{85018}Asterix, Obelix!
{85112}{85211}Step aside, we're coming out.|- Oh no, you're not coming out.
{85213}{85282}- Oh yes we are.
{85417}{85510}You meant, you're coming out.
{86043}{86166}What? The druid have escaped from|prison? Those Gauls will soon find out ...
{86169}{86292}what it means to brave Caesar' anger!|Tomorrow when they waken I will have ...
{86319}{86467}a little surprise waiting for them,|and I think you will like it!
{87056}{87182}Master, the building site is deserted,|none of the workers have come to work.
{87189}{87301}What's going on? What's happened now?
{87475}{87598}In the name of Caesar, we hear some|Gaulish troublemaker are hiding on this...
{87601}{87734}building site. we order them to surrender,|if they don't we shall attack, by Jupiter!
{87739}{87876}We don't want to fight, but if we have|t o, we've got the men and the stones!
{87880}{87934}You'll be sorry for this. By Mercury!
{87938}{88070}What are we going to do, by ourselves?|- We build our fortifications by Felenos.
{88074}{88148}You're quite right, my ben salaam.
{88152}{88249}Do you think we might go home now|by any job?
{89530}{89578}To the attack!
{90358}{90474}Return to the battle!|- Join the army, re-enlist the masses.
{90478}{90601}They are back again!
{91251}{91308}To the attack!
{91311}{91394}See the world, the man said.
{91741}{91820}To the attack!|- He's nut!
{91823}{91878}You're off your head!|- No kidding.
{91881}{91978}If that's the way it's going to be,|we'll have to bombard them.
{92276}{92412}Hey look, they've got guided missiles.|If they miss I'll be surprised.
{92415}{92463}Fire!
{92734}{92850}My palace! They are|breaking up my palace!
{92853}{92976}We ought to let Cleopatra know,|she is the only one who can get ...
{92979}{93078}Caesar to stop this attack!|- Good idea, I'll write Her a letter.
{93102}{93226}And Dogmatix will deliver it for you.|Dogmatix? But he's much too small.
{93229}{93326}Dogmatix is not too small.|- Obelix don't be pig headed, ...
{93329}{93419}Dogmatix can not deliver that message.|- Yes he can! Mr. Asterix does ...
{93422}{93477}everything, Mr. Asterix|has to be the boss!
{93480}{93528}You know what Mr. Asterix has to say?
{93531}{93630}No just what does Mr. Asterix has to say?|- Here is the message, but how are ...
{93634}{93731}we going to get it to Cleopatra?|We are being besieged.
{93737}{93824}Oh you had better ask|Mr. Asterix, he's boss.
{93831}{93932}Now, now Obelix, don't be cross|I was only teasing.
{93934}{93969}My dog is no good.
{93972}{94059}Dogmatix will deliver the message,|and I'll deliver Dogmatix.
{94070}{94157}Watch out, one of the Gauls|is breaking out.
{94342}{94435}He went the same way he came.|- He was only passing through.
{94821}{94944}Oh Gauls from a far, sworn to destroy|my power, I will show you how ...
{94947}{95020}a Queen...can die, now is the great love...
{95023}{95146}No, no, my dog has brought|a message for you.
{95184}{95258}Oh isn't he sweet? Someone bring a|bone for the dear little dog.
{95274}{95393}This will never do. By Osiris,|Julius Caesar isn't play fair.
{95396}{95491}Right oh Gaul, I will take care of this.
{95495}{95592}Watch out! One of Gaul is breaking in.
{95729}{95832}There you go Obelix, Dogmatix is back.|He carried out his mission perfectly!
{95834}{95892}Oh you see, I was right?
{96012}{96100}Let's hope Cleopatra acts quickly, those|Romans meddlers are demolishing ...
{96103}{96167}the whole palace!
{96169}{96262}You see Caesar, even if we don't capture|those three Gauls, it comes to the ...
{96265}{96360}same thing, the whole palace|will be destroyed.
{96363}{96420}Good excellent!
{96423}{96512}Hail Caesar, there is someone who wants|a word with you, there.
{96959}{97082}Oh my Queen, what a happy chance.|-That will do! When I heard what was...
{97085}{97184}happening I hurried out at once.|I didn't even stop to change my dress.
{97187}{97305}When you make a bet you're supposed|to play it fair and I had every right to...
{97309}{97412}call the Gauls, and I'll prove to you that|my Egyptians can still build a beautiful...
{97414}{97539}palaces, and I insist that the Roman leave|the builders alone and let me tell you...
{97543}{97691}Yes, yes, all right I apologise.|- Well I should hope so, let's go home.
{98007}{98130}Well, what do we do now Caesar?|- We lift the siege, you idiot.
{98663}{98789}Look, the Romans are lifting the siege!|- Victory by Tutatis!
{98793}{98872}Goodies, goodies!|- And it's all thanks to Dogmatix!
{98876}{98924}Now then, back to work.
{98987}{99086}Sure enough the work gets going|again and at considerable speed, ...
{99088}{99180}since you will remember when architects|did not finish the job on time ...
{99183}{99306}they were thrown to the crocodiles, a|good old custom sadly neglected today.
{99309}{99382}At last one fine morning...
{99402}{99510}Oh my Queen the palace is ready for you!|- You have kept you word Edephus, ...
{99513}{99633}I Cleopatra will keep mine.|By Osiris cover him with gold!
{100330}{100478}Oh My Queen! The loveliest of Queens!|I have lost my bet and now I yield
{100484}{100558}the victory to you, yours is the honour|of cutting this ribbon Cleopatra.
{100893}{101016}I know how much i owe you Gauls,|and you have earned my heart felt ...
{101019}{101136}gratitude, I will have you sent home|to Gauls on my own state galley.
{101141}{101220}It was nothing Cleopatra,|it was nothing, goodbye now.
{101226}{101294}Say, will there be any boars|on this galley of yours?
{101297}{101383}Obelix!|- Why does he have to keep ...
{101386}{101485}telling me off all the time? This state|galleys might be all very but if there ...
{101487}{101540}aren't any boars it's hardly worth|making all fuss over!
{101889}{102012}Everyone is eating, everyone is|drinking, everyone is joyful and ...
{102015}{102138}celebrating and the happy ending|of this story.
{102104}{102208}Everyone is drinking? Everyone is eating?|Everyone?
{102214}{102274}Well, nearly everyone.
{102544}{102667}And when spring comes ...
{102671}{102787}Cleopatra's magnificent ship approches|the coast of Gauls where the little village...
{102790}{102913}welcomes its heroes with its usual|enthusiasm and feasting.
Papers please, sir.
You want to see my driving license?
My friend won't be needing any.
Papers in order, sir.
What happened to Kaminsky, McDonald,
Akhmed, the two Maltese?
I brought back the young officer, as you told me.
I left the others behind.
And what went wrong this time?
We got within 20 miles, then I was spotted by a couple of snipers.
And what happened to Lieutenant Evans exactly?
He was just unlucky.
Get yourself cleaned up.
I want to talk to you.
Brigadier Blore is waiting, sir.
- You're not going to change, sir?
- Into what?
Another one down the dilly.
So far, Masters, you have cost the British Army £42,000 in what you call miscellaneous costs.
Plus 17 jeeps, 24 trucks, a small fortune in ammunition and supplies and the lives of three British officers.
Forty-three of my men have been killed also, sir.
Your total requisition for the past 12 months has been £124,563.
Yes, sir.
You've sent eight missions behind the German lines, and you've achieved nothing.
Colonel Masters, you are a luxury we cannot afford.
My work over the last 12 months has been a preparatory exploration into the techniques which I intend to employ.
The experience of the great commanders of the past who have fought over this very same territory will ultimately prove invaluable.
Modern warfare has nothing whatever to do with the activities of Alexander the Great or Hannibal.
The principles of desert warfare have not changed.
The principles of getting value for your money haven't changed either.
Masters, your outfit is disbanded forthwith.
Captain Attwood will go back with you, and you will hand over to him.
- You yourself will take a week's leave...
- Yes, sir.
...to find yourself a suitable uniform.
I know that you have to wear mufti, but you might shave occasionally.
Yes, indeed, sir.
You will then take over command of the prisoner of war camp at Sidi Barrani with effect from the 17th.
I have located, through my contacts with the Mujabra tribesmen, the perfect target for my kind of operation.
Where the hell did you get this photograph?
It appears the Mujabra tribesmen have learnt how to use the Brownie cameras I supplied them with.
This camp is about 400 miles behind the enemy lines.
Precisely. You can't get there, but I can.
Two men are going to stop Rommel.
One of them is Adolf Hitler, who cannot give him enough fuel, the other is me, who's going to blow up the little he has.
Masters, I shall give you one more chance.
Thank you, sir.
This time you've got to succeed.
I shall put the expedition under the command of a British officer.
But British officers don't understand my method, sir.
Do as I say, and this time I want him back.
- Yes, sir.
- Alive.
If I must have an officer, sir, could he be someone who knows something about pipelines, petrol installations, that sort of thing?
- We'll see if we have someone to spare.
- Yes, sir.
Don't forget, Masters, this is your last chance.
Thank you, sir.
- I'll send them back to you.
- Yes, sir.
- Ask Watkins to come in, would you?
- Yes, sir.
Alan, I had an idea.
Take a look at that and that.
Interested?
There must be millions of gallons in there by the look of things.
- Rommel's?
- Yes.
There. About 400 miles behind their lines.
I got the location pretty accurately from some of my Mujabra tribesmen.
Actually, they took the photographs for me.
- Like to go and blow it up?
- We'll give you a show, sir.
Rommel is here.
His lines of communication are really extended, so we're going to hit him hard.
Now, if you can destroy the bulk of his fuel supplies at that moment, it might make all the difference.
We'll try, sir.
Rommel's gonna be defeated by two men, Watkins.
Adolf Hitler, who can't give him enough fuel, and me, because I'm gonna blow up what little he has.
By the way, I'm sending a decoy group ahead of you.
- You know Masters' bunch?
- Not those gangsters, sir.
Yes, they set off a day before you.
Same route, same orders.
If there's any trouble, let them catch it.
Not particularly pleasant, sir.
You leave in two days, Watkins.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Well, that's that.
What about the British officer for Colonel Masters, sir?
Oh, completely forgot.
Tell them to find a spare captain from somewhere.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, and I suppose he'd better know something about petrol.
Yes, sir.
Where can I find Captain Douglas, Sarge?
- Who?
- Captain Douglas.
Up there.
- Captain Douglas, sir?
- Yes.
Colonel Homerton would like to see you in his office, sir.
Colonel Homerton said immediately, sir.
Tell Colonel Homerton
I'll be there in an hour.
I have to finish unloading the fuel.
As you say, sir.
- You're late.
- I know. What's up?
I don't know, honestly.
- It's not...
- No. No.
Wish me luck.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes.
Captain Douglas is on loan from British Petroleum.
He's worked for seven years as a field engineer with the Anglo-Iranian branch.
- So, you know the desert?
- Yes.
- A little.
- Excellent.
Captain Attwood here is from HQ, Special Forces.
They want an officer with some experience of fuel supplies to take command of a rather unusual unit.
May I point out, sir, that the arrangement with British Petroleum was that I stay in port areas.
What are you wearing?
British uniform, sir.
British Petroleum uniform?
No, sir.
Good. Captain Attwood will give you the Brigadier's orders.
He's your man.
This is it, sir.
Are you sure?
Yes, sir. Caf?'s over there.
- Colonel Masters?
- No.
- Oh, then I'll have a whiskey, please.
- No whiskey.
- I'll have a beer then.
- No beer.
What do you have?
Tea.
Then I'll have tea.
Looking for Colonel Masters?
Who are you?
I'm Captain Leech.
- British Army?
- No.
Follow me.
Some kind of a soldier to see you, Colonel.
Yes.
- Colonel Masters, sir?
- Yes.
Captain Douglas, sir.
Oh, my dear fellow, there's no need for all that.
My number two, Captain Leech.
How do you do? Which regiment, Captain?
Late of the Fourth Panzer.
Do you know why you're here, Douglas?
I understand I'm to command one of your units on a special mission.
Thank you, Leech.
See you later.
Now, let me explain exactly what you're here for.
Caprus Magna, a Roman port in Cyrenaica, that the Germans appear to be using as a petrol dump.
Are these Rommel's positions, sir?
No, those are the positions of the Carthaginians in the year 215 B.C.
Desert warfare hasn't changed.
Like the ancient Egyptians, I'm going to send an expedition south to Qattara.
Across the Qattara Depression, through the cliffs of the Siwah Pass, over the great sand sea, through the stony desert, and crash into Caprus Magna.
And that's what you're here for.
I am going to lead a unit down there, across there and up there.
Exactly. I'll give you my best man.
He knows the ropes.
- Captain Leech?
- A man of considerable experience.
All right. Get back to work.
- Have you signed your crew on yet?
- Yes.
- How many are you taking?
- Oh, seven, that's enough.
One more would get in the way.
Seven's my lucky number.
Eight is what you've got, and I believe I'm in command.
Is our friend serious?
I'm sure he will work very closely with you, Leech.
Naturally, I would be grateful for any help I could get.
I see. Well, I've got a better idea.
Keep it at seven.
You go, I'll stay.
Then everybody's happy.
I've told Stores to kit you out.
I expect they're waiting for you.
- We'll talk more at dinner.
- Very well, sir.
Captain Leech, I want a full inspection at 7:00 tomorrow morning.
Everything laid out and ready to load.
Anything else you'd like?
No, I think that's all.
I'll see you at dinner, sir.
What's all this about?
Brigadier Blore's not very pleased with our record.
He insists. We'll have to take him.
I'll take him.
If he doesn't come back alive, we're out of business.
You're out of business.
You get well paid for these trips, don't you, Leech?
Not really.
I'll give you a bonus if you get him back.
- How much?
- Dead, nothing.
Alive, £2,000.
You just bought yourself an Englishman.
Where did you find him?
One of my recruiting drives at Rabida prison.
Tunisian named Sadok.
He threw a bomb into a caf?, shot a policeman, and then at his trial, he leaned over and punched the presiding official on the nose.
He got 14 years. He's our demolition man.
Kostos Manov.
Smuggling arms and explosives into Egypt.
They ran him in and I ran him out.
First class armorer.
Boudesh.
Nice chap.
Going a bit strong with an Egyptian girl.
Her brothers came down to invite him to his wedding. He shot them.
Still a bachelor. Communications.
Kafkarides, a Cypriot.
His game was narcotics in a big way.
Shot a couple of customs men.
Transport and supplies.
Hassan and Assine, Sinusi Arab guides.
Are they always so friendly?
All they ask is keef and each other.
That's everybody.
Aren't you going to tell him about me?
I thought you might like to do that yourself, Captain Leech.
The black sheep of an otherwise admirable family from County Dublin.
Most recent deployment, master of a tramp steamer running around the Red Sea.
Sank her for the insurance off Djibouti.
You ought to tell the crew, of course.
They're all drowned, all but one of them.
He told the insurance company.
I got 15 years.
When I met him in Rabida prison, he was king of the damn place.
They hated to see him go, but I needed him more than they did.
War is a criminal enterprise.
I fight it with criminals.
Not to worry, my dear fellow.
Leech knows the routine.
He'll get you out and he'll get you back.
Won't you, Leech?
If he's lucky.
Will I be lucky?
That's up to you, and him, of course.
Very Italian.
Yeah.
Nice morning for a drive, Captain.
I ordered an inspection for 7:00 this morning.
I did it for you. All over.
Let's go.
Anything wrong?
Good luck.
And keep in touch.
Let's go!
This is as far as we can go, sir.
The Germans have a few patrols going south of here.
Thank you, Corporal.
Here we go to the right.
I said we go right.
That road was mined by the Italians a week ago.
They don't put it all on the map.
Take another left.
Splendid, Major Watkins. Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Carry on, Lieutenant.
Mount vehicles!
Bara'sa.
- What does that mean?
- They're Bara'sa. Could be dangerous.
Depends who's paying them.
Six men, six camels.
No lead camel.
They're an advance party.
The others could arrive any minute.
Hassan's going to spot them.
- We've got to have water.
- Exactly.
We're Italians, aren't we?
Why don't we trade?
You asking me or telling me?
I'm asking you.
There's an advance party of Bara'sa at the oasis.
We're an Italian patrol who need food and water. Let's go to market.
Everybody else, parli Italiano.
And tune into an Italian radio station.
- I think we chose the right uniform.
- Don't be too sure.
If they offer you tea, drink it.
If they offer you food, eat it.
- What did you do that for?
- I didn't like the tea.
See if there's anything we need in the packs.
Are you out of your mind?
If anybody's going to get killed here,
I give the order.
- Is that clear?
- Somebody gave the show away.
- Who?
- You did.
If you'd stayed at home, they'd still be alive.
Well, I didn't stay at home.
And I'm not leaving.
It's a German radio.
Every patrol in the south would have been on to us five hours after we left them.
Destroy it.
Fifty more Bara'sa coming.
They're miles away.
They won't be here till nightfall.
We can't go that way.
We're not going back.
Then there's only one other way we can go.
Is there a pass?
Not for 120 miles, right down to Siwah.
Let's have a look.
All aboard!
Aren't they going to bury them?
We'll have to go back.
- How long are these cables?
- About 250 feet each.
That'll never work.
Are we carrying any string?
Yeah.
Get it.
Lead on.
We need 327 feet.
Sadok, shackle those cables together.
- Are you strong?
- Yes.
Then get the end of that cable to the top of that cliff.
- Aren't you coming up?
- No.
Kafkarides, sand channels, pulleys and tow chain.
Unload those trucks!
Take that down and shackle it to the other truck.
Yes, Captain.
Hold it!
Kostos Manov.
- He says unload.
- Take it up.
Are they ready?
Yes.
Take it away.
Is that truck loaded?
Foolish!
Cable's going!
Get down!
Radio's gone. No more music.
I ordered you to unload.
Yes.
Salvage what you can.
We spend the night at the top of the cliffs.
Murdering bastards.
Masters' men. Who else?
Now every Arab for 200 miles knows there are British patrols in the Qattara Depression.
Do you think we should change our course, sir?
Impossible.
This is the only track out of the Qattara.
We got to keep going south until we get to Siwah Pass.
Very good, sir.
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.
Get these corpses buried.
They're beginning to stink.
Certainly, sir.
Get these corpses buried!
Germans.
Come.
Our business is blowing fuel dumps.
You play dirty, Captain Leech.
The way to survive here is to watch, listen and say nothing.
I play safe.
Good. Get the men.
Bury them.
Bury them!
I think he means it.
You'd have killed one of us, maybe two, you'd have been the third.
- I know.
- That wasn't very clever.
You want to forget the noble sentiments if you want to live.
I'll manage.
Funny thing, survival.
We've only covered 80 kilometers in the last two-and-a-half days.
Quite good going.
At this rate, the war will be over before we get there.
Don't worry, you'll get your medal.
Why don't you say something?
What?
I said why don't you say something?
Why don't you talk, like a human being?
Because I want to survive here,
I watch, I listen and I say nothing.
In any case, Captain Leech,
I don't trust you, and I really don't want to know you.
- All right.
- Tell me something.
- How did the other English officers die?
- Unexpectedly.
Must find new one.
- What about spares?
- No more spares.
If I'd done the inspection, there'd be more spares.
There may be some tires.
Let's have a look.
We're getting close.
Better start traveling by night.
Let's see if there's a tire.
This looks like a good one that'll fit.
There's a jack here.
Keep perfectly still.
Kostos Manov.
See if it's wired.
It is wired.
Don't move.
Hassan.
Hassan.
Okay.
Are those all the dressings you've got?
We lost them in the wireless truck.
Stop! Stop!
Hold it!
If we go on, Hassan will die!
- Can't we leave them?
- We need them.
There's a German supply road only 20 miles from here.
We'll have a look.
We've got to keep going!
Go on.
You're learning.
Kafkarides, get in the back.
Come on, get in the front.
It's all right.
It's only a nurse.
Hold that.
Don't you know how to handle a woman?
Boudesh.
No.
She can take care of Hassan.
If he dies, you die.
Understand?
Any luck?
The receiver's gone, but I think we can transmit.
What time are we due to transmit?
278 megacycles at 1922 hours.
We'll try before we move off tonight.
What happened here?
Nothing.
What are you telling them?
I'm trying to explain why we're six days late.
Well, keep it short. We don't want to be monitored by the Germans.
That's it.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
We go in now?
Why not? It's perfect cover.
You won't be very popular.
With them or with you?
Don't worry about me. Worry about them.
We're going in under cover of this storm.
Come on.
Sadok, tell him if she causes trouble, to kill her quietly with this.
Mines!
Mines!
Captain.
Keep in my footsteps.
I'm going ahead.
Bastards!
Well, this mission's over.
Now we can go home.
I'm in command here.
We're going to find the real fuel depot and destroy it.
Well, go ahead.
Give them your orders.
Right. We're going to find the real fuel depot.
Come on.
Me, I'm going to find a boat.
Anyone interested?
You don't care about anything, do you?
I care about you.
That's why I've been looking after you.
Masters is paying me to bring you back alive.
How much?
Want a ride, Captain?
Come in.
Sit down.
This aerial photograph shows your oil dump is still intact.
You seem to have failed again.
I'm afraid so, sir.
That's all right, Masters.
In fact, it's exactly what we want.
Montgomery has broken through.
He's moving fast along the coast.
By tomorrow night, we'll be in Cyrenaica, by the weekend, Benghazi.
I knew things were moving, sir, but...
So our conventional methods do seem to have paid off.
Quite.
So, I shall want you to call your chaps off.
I can't do that, sir.
I've lost contact with them.
I've had orders to capture all fuel depots.
We need them.
What can I do, sir?
Don't you know of a reliable double agent?
Get in touch.
You want me to inform against my own men, sir?
Do you know any other way of stopping them?
- Is this an order, sir?
- Yes.
- Then may I have it in writing, please?
- No.
But you'd be well advised to do it.
- I'll see what I can do, sir.
- Do it.
Boats.
- Petrol.
- Forget the petrol.
As soon as it's dark,
I'll be on one of those boats.
I'll feel safer.
I'm sure you will.
I think I have an idea.
What's that?
Create a diversion.
Blow the fuel dump, and while they're fighting fires, grab a boat.
- You're still trying to win a medal.
- No.
I don't think I'll get a medal.
But you'll get your boat.
We can give it a try.
What are you telling them now?
We attack at midnight tonight.
Let's go.
Put down your guns and stand up.
First, come forward.
148525.
Captain R. V. Douglas.
Royal Engineers.
Second, Cyril Leech.
Third, Sadok.
Fourth, Kostos Manov.
Fifth, Kafkarides.
Sixth, Hassan.
Seventh, Assine.
Stand up and come forward.
You are surrounded.
I repeat.
We know you are here.
Come out at once.
You shoot that one.
I'll shoot this one.
Throw the charges that way and go.
Go.
Wait. Throw the charges that way, but follow me.
How did they know our names?
Masters told them.
- Why would he do that?
- Stop us blowing the oil.
They must have changed their minds.
If he betrayed us, he deserves to be shot.
What does it matter who betrayed us?
The Germans can catch you.
You can trip over a mine.
It's the principle of the thing.
You sound like the man who gave me 15 years.
I wouldn't be here now if I wasn't worth £2,000 to you.
Would I?
Probably not.
Lie still.
Assine.
Assine.
Assine.
Assine.
- Well, the news is wonderful, isn't it?
- It is rather good, sir, isn't it?
- Not too late for another drink, is it?
- No, indeed, sir.
By the way, congratulations.
- I gather you reached your chaps.
- Yes. It would appear so, sir.
I had one or two notions about stirring up a little trouble in Tripolitania.
Tell me more. But first, here's to Monty.
And here's to victory.
To victory.
- They're British.
- I know.
- Have you got anything white?
- No.
I should wait.
If you're going to surrender,
I should leave the pistol.
Come on, Cyril.
Don't you want your£2,000?
Sorry, sir. I didn't see the white flag.
Don't do it again.

CHEERING AND WHISTLING 
Quiet! 
As impressive a list of honours as we have seen for many a day. 
Wanted by Scotland Yard for thirty broken safes, two escapes from prison, read the rest for yourself. 
Facing 14 years further imprisonment. Interesting. 
For what we have in mind I think he has possibilities. 
You've got possibilities too! 
I like you, Herr Chapman. I like his wicked tongue. 
Wicked tongues can be dangerous. 
Chapman, evidently you are clever. 
Are you clever enough to see that now you've met all of us, you could identify us and will probably be shot? 
That is to say... 
That is to say unless you hire me? 
Who are you, Chapman? 
Three hours of questioning, 22 cigarettes, I thought you'd understand by now. 
I'm a realist, I'm in prison and I want to get out. 
I don't give a damn for Germany or England. Why should I? 
- You haven't finished? 
- Damn right. I'm going to be on the winning side. 
- Whichever it is? 
- Yes, whichever it is. 
If it's England, God help me. I'll have fifteen years behind bars. 
Fourteen. 
England? England will be no more. It will be erased to the ground. 
Have I a choice? I'd rather live for Germany than die for England. 
And if we wanted you to die... for Germany? 
Price would be the same. High, of course. 
Of course. 
Take him back to his cell. 
Herr Chapman? 
It is possible you will hear from us. 
- More probably you will not. 
- That file speaks for itself. 
You don't see recommendations like that every day. 
Well? 
Much too soon to say. 
- It is obvious, he's a risk. 
- Why do you say that? 
Judging from his dossier he cares too much for women. 
Acute observation, they say. That cigarette will make exactly 23.

10km north of Paris, sort of a transit camp. 
Some of us they send on, most of us they shoot. 
Any way out? 
No, there's not enough time to plan an escape route. 
Get in here!

So why bring me here? Malta's not at war with Hitler. 
What did they grab you boys for? 
Me, I was a waiter at the Savoy grill. 
- They thought I was a spy. 
- Are you? 
You must have a great sense of humour. 
If I told you... 
THEY SPEAK GERMAN 
You've got a nerve asking the Commander to come down here. 
Yes, I thought you might understand German. 
Now look, you may be a pigeon they've planted, or not, but unless you want to wake up stiff one morning, keep out of my way. 
And another thing... I'm superstitious too. 
In my book, three's a crowd.

Life is so dull here.

- Ssh, nothing to worry about. 
- They'll send you to Germany or shoot you! 
- How long have you been here? 
A month, but what's that do with it? 
Everything. 
You're right, you're so right. 
- Move along there. 
- Good night, Chapman. 
- I must know your name. 
- Does it matter?

- I'll say it was my fault. 
Silence! 
- Paulette, Paulette Gehehr. 
- QUIET!

- Property of EA Chapman. 
Ł24 in notes, six shillings in silver, one gold-plated watch. 
Gold-plated? I never wear imitation! 
Well...put down solid gold. 
- And what address where they can be sent to? 
- Address? 
- So they can be restored after the war. 
Put them with the other things you're holding for Paulette Gehehr. 
A charming thought. She can have them if and when she ever gets out. 
- You know what they're going to do with me? 
- I have an idea. 
- Having been a waiter, you know the difference between a sheep and a goat. 
- I don't get you. 
For either one they hang you!

- This man is dangerous. He's a public menace.

- Well, it's been a great life.

"Shot while attempting to escape." 
- But why a Jersey newspaper?

As an added precaution, your little friend was released - Paulette something. 
- If as we think, she's in the Resistance, they will pass that back. 
- Yeah, but the date. 
- Tomorrow's date. 
Your name is Franz Grauman, private, second-class, in the Germany Army. 
- Franz who? 
- Grauman, remember it. 
Grauman, lovely. 
What else must I remember? 
Not to ask questions. 
Not to go near the radio room, unless accompanied. 
Not to mix with men from other sections, listen to whatever I say. 
WHATEVER. 
Whatever. 
- Oh. 
- Yes? 
- I'm sorry. Was I crowding you? 
- Any time. 
Franz, you are about to meet your new chief, the head of your unit, Colonel Baron Von Grunen. 
Be careful with him. He is, well...unpredictable. 
- But a very, very remarkable man. 
- Uh-huh. 
- I thought all the servants left before darkness. 
- They used to. 
Report to me. Come on. 
Go on in. 
- Don't you salute? 
- It takes time to learn how to salute. 
- Are you well, Countess? 
- Well enough. Long motor trips are tiring. 
- I suggest you get some sleep. 
- Tomorrow morning at nine, Herr Steinhager. 
- Nine o'clock. 
- Good night. 
- Good night. 
Deutsche Ordnung - German order. 
Sit down. 
You're a safe-cracker, prisoner, private, second-class, and a potential member of the most successful espionage group in the army. 
A long way in one day. 
- To your health, Grauman. 
- I thought you only drank the Fuhrer's health. 
- To the health of the king of England. 
- I'll drink to mine. 
- You might be called a businessman. 
- Makes a change, brandy with a pedigree. 
- This object also has a pedigree. 
- It's Persian, six, seven hundred years old, isn't it? 
And it can be destroyed in a fraction of a second. 
You were once one of His Majesty's footguards. They taught you to shoot? 
Yes. 
From there, shoot the head of this animal. 
You obey orders in a roundabout way. 
- But that happens to suit me. 
- You didn't really want me to do that. 
The shot you just fired either broke the microphone that I believe is hidden in this room, or the eardrums of the man listening in. 
In the paintings or the lamps, no doubt. I tell you as a warning. Mistrust EVERYBODY. 
- Oh, I always have. 
- I mean EVERYBODY without exception. Clear? 
Good night. 
And Grauman, tomorrow you will say "Colonel" or "Sir". 
You will salute properly as in the army by clicking your heels or touching your cap. 
All right, Baron. 
Goodnight.

A home-made detonator out of a child's toy. A construction set. 
Let someone else do the job for you. 
This is one of our own manufacture. 
A gun for firing round corners. You see the enemy in the mirror. He can't see you. 
Everything there you can find in hardware stores, all to make an explosive. 
Set if off with any friendly, familiar object. 
Secret radio frequencies of other agents. 
He should be ready in two months. 
- I have certain doubts about him. 
- I told you he was your responsibility, Countess. 
Study him thoroughly - it could be worthwhile. 
The English Secret Service trained him and imprisoned him in Jersey, so he could infiltrate himself into our service. 
- His criminal past is a fiction meant to deceive us. 
- I say he endangers our work here. 
You have a personal prejudice against him. Steinhager, you discovered and investigated him. 
- You arranged for him to be watched. Do you have second thoughts? 
- Baron, I trust no-one. 
I'm a security officer. It's my duty to suspect everyone. 
Are you going to say that you also suspect the Fuhrer? 
I didn't go to the University of Heidelberg like yourself. 
Before the army, I was a policeman. 
- And as a policeman, I know men. 
- The discussion is closed. 
Franz Grauman will be trained for an extremely important mission. 
You don't have to know about it for now. 
Report to me anything he says or does, no matter how charming and pleasant a companion he is. 
You seem determined to force me into his bed. Anybody would think I need a procure. 
- Procurer, manager. 
- Yes, that's how you saw it always. 
I saw that in your case, someone was needed to develop your latent possibilities. 
Charmingly put. 
You had costly training in England. I hope to see the results now. 
One day I'll tell you how costly it has been. 
You already have, several times. 
Grauman. 
Back to work. Good hunting. 
Who sent you in here? 
I couldn't sleep. 
You didn't try hard enough. 
- What's the matter? 
- Couldn't sleep. 
I could read you a nursery rhyme. Or sing you a lullaby. 
- Just you try. 
- You should hear me sing. A voice like a cornflake on a stormy night. 
- Tell me, what is the matter? 
- This place is getting me down. 
- I'm not surprised. They work you like a mad man. 
- That parachute training - I can hardly move. 
Come on, turn over - I'll give you a rub. 
- Turn my back on you? Are you out of your mind? 
- Don't be a fool - I am in charge of the English section. 
You are in the English section. 
- What's so funny? 
- Oh, this whole business. 
Every little spy is spy is a... 
Well, it's a shabby business. But you're not training for the priesthood. The money is good. 
- I haven't seen any of it yet. 
- You're not the only one! There. 
- Oh. 
Yes, boss. I suppose... 
- What, you suppose? 
- If anyone can be honest in this business, it's you. 
Yes, honest little Helga Lindstrohm. The poor man's Mata Hari. 
Who, if she could give me away, would do it. 
I wouldn't enjoy it. 
- But you would. 
- That's what I'm paid for, isn't it? 
- I think I like you. 
Helga Lindstrohm. 
- I do like you. 
- I'm glad you do. 
It's not part of the deal, but I prefer it like this. 
SIREN WAILS 
They must be on their way. 
Well, at least we can both say it isn't one of ours. 
THEY SHOUT ORDERS IN GERMAN 
- Got a light? 
- Yes. 
Gentlemen, there is very little time. 
British and Canadian forces landed an hour ago at Dieppe - a diversion from an all-out invasion elsewhere. 
We must suspend all training activities and round up potential Resistance French personnel. 
I'm handing over control to Colonel Steinhager. His experience in these matters is far greater than mine. 
Yes, Colonel. Men, we meet in 30 minutes. 
HE SHOUTS ORDERS IN GERMAN 
This way. 
MORE SHOUTING Open up! 
Open up, I say! 
Quick, finish your message and hide your radio. 
Come on, come on! 
- HEAVY KNOCKING I'm finished. 
- Go to the bedroom. 
- Take the back staircase. 
- Open up! 
- German police! 
- Hurry up! 
- Open this door! 
- Quick. 
- Open up this door! 
- What is it? 
Yes. 
Come in. 
Papers? 
Search them, always do that first. 
Where did you get that watch? 
Where?! 
I didn't take it. 
- Who from? 
- It was given to me. 
- By whom? 
- A girl. 
- Her name? 
- Her name? 
- Just a girl. 
Tell me where she is. 
Tell me where she is. 
Bravo, Grauman. You're beginning to learn the business. 
All right, I'll look after them now. 
You search the other apartments. 
Get up. 
Now I want to talk to you. 
- Get up. 
- Eddie, that's you... 
- Quiet! 
Why are you wearing that uniform? 
- You gave this away. 
- They said that you were dead. 
You have to get out of here now, otherwise you're finished. 
Leave an address with someone in this house and don't give this away. 
Ah. 
- Am I intruding? 
- You intrude? Never. 
No, that's not your type, surely? 
We're after bigger fish than that. 
She's not even small fry. 
Name? 
Proceed. 
- Name? 
- Gilligan, Duncan. 
- I don't want to interrupt you. 
Name's James. I'm a sergeant. 
- Rank? 
- Lieutenant. 
- Number? 
Huh! He has a wife in a million. 
"This is to certify that while overseas, Sergeant William Daniels, my husband, 
"has full permission to consort with any pretty girl." 
- You speak it well. 
- Four years in night school, you pick it up. 
One of them, are you? Take a look. 
Another bloody renegade... 
SHOUTING 
Push off, will you? 
Well, as I was saying, before I was interrupted... 
One lighter, one 20 size packet of Players containing 12 cigarettes, three-penny bus ticket, bar of chocolate, 
- hotel bill, box of matches... 
- Leave the rest here, Keller. 
Does it mean that against my recommendation you will use Grauman? 
It means check items listed, nothing more. 
- Do you approve the contract? 
- It seems all right, but why a contract? 
- THEY SPEAK GERMAN 
- This is a personal contract between you and me. 
It gives me control of you. 
The Luftwaffe can't have the use of your services 
- without my permission. 
- They want me? 
- Succeed in this assignment and they'll want you. 
- I don't know what this assignment is. 
You won't know till the last moment. 
Unless the British paid their troops in counterfeit money that's Sterling. 
We took over Ł1 million at Dunkirk alone. 
Are you ready to sign the contract or do you have any more questions? 
Two questions - the 100,000 marks I get paid - when and how? 
When you succeed and in any currency you wish. 
Are they in there? 
- The safe. 
- Sign. 
I think this calls for a celebration. 
If I'd been running the Savoy Grill, you'd have been fired the first day. 
Your navigation, Major... Swimming the Channel was never an ambition. 
Your people live very well. 
But of course. Can't you see? We literally lack nothing here. 
Nothing at all. 
My people are special. Exceptional talents deserve exceptional treatments. 
Are all of them equally special? 
You have a mission tonight. You mustn't flirt with me. 
Some of the most highly trained specialists in the world are here. 
- Ah. 
- Care to see a demonstration? 
In this watch is a time fuse. 
He will blow up one of the trees outside at the stroke of nine. 
Let me go with him, keep an eye on him. 
- Good idea - you haven't been drinking. 
- I have been drinking! 
HE IMITATES A BRASS INSTRUMENT 
Now he has gone. 
- Nine o'clock. 
- It must be fast. My people don't make mistakes. 
- Not of this sort. 
- I heard you - what a fox. 
I'll check it with the nine o'clock on the BBC. 
You listen to the British?! 
You heard the Colonel - special treatment. 
RADIO: This is the BBC Home And Forces programme. 
This is the Nine O'Clock news... EXPLOSION 
CONFUSED SHOUTING 
Grauman! 
Where are you, Grauman? Grauman! 
Where's Grauman? I've looked everywhere. 
Where were you? 
- I cut it on some broken glass. 
- Let me look at it for you. 
Oh, dear. 
HE TUTS 
You don't think I cut it myself? Now, really! 
- Good luck. 
- Thank you. 
- Eddie. 
- Oh. 
Now, here are your special instructions. 
Within 15 minutes of landing in England, you must get on the air to us with a safe landing signal. 
That's a must, or we'll send another plane with a replacement. 
- 15 minutes - clear? 
- You'll hear from me in much less time than that. 
Heil Hitler! 
- Bye. 
- Heil Hitler! 
- Oh, heil Hitler. 
Colonel, they are transmitting. 
CODE COMES THROUGH 
They are circling the landing area. 
We are here. Stand by. 
Hey, you bloody fool! 
The release check. 
He's not going to transmit. I can tell you exactly what he's doing right now. 
He's given up every intention of carrying out his mission. 
He's trying to get a ride into the nearest town. 
Still nothing yet. 
Are you convinced now, Colonel? That makes 40 minutes. 
We'll wait another 30 minutes. 
Made in France? 
Bastards! 
I want you to bring him back to me - dead or alive. 
- He can't have anywhere to hide. 
- The cars are ready outside. 
Come on. 
I'm convinced you are making a mistake. It may be woman's intuition but I feel something's happened. 
Colonel Steinhager was right to impose this test, or a serious mistake might have been made. 
If you have caught him, I'm glad it wasn't I who caught him for you. I'm going to bed. 
CODE COMES THROUGH 
Wait! Wait! I've got something. 
- I've got him now. 
- What is it? 
- Grauman is transmitting. 
Tell him to stay where he is, we're coming for him. 
Your feminine intuition, Countess, is remarkable. 
- Come on! 
- FRANTIC CLICKING 
DISTANT SHOUTING 
Grauman! 
What kept you, you imbeciles? Who do you think you are? 
- Is that a bat or a strong box? 
- Right in the middle of that tree! 
Stop that! 
- I had to put you to the test. 
- Charming(!) 
Last time I'm jumping, that's all. Thank you very much. 
- Next time will be the real thing. 
- My nerves won't take it. 
- It's a shock. I'm scared to hell of it. 
- Really? 
- Yes. 
It's gonna take a bigger shock than that to get me back to normal. 
- By that you mean...? 
- An extra thousand pounds. 
HE SIGHS 
- Who sent you in here? 
- I couldn't sleep. 
- Try harder. 
At least you'll be sure of one thing for now. 
Is that all you have to say to me? 
No. Heil Hitler(!) 
- SHE GIGGLES 
- Heil Hitler! 
The factory entrance. Only one policeman on duty. 
Power plant. 
The position for explosives. 
Thank you, Lars. 
- You won't forget all the codewords I taught you? 
- No, no, no. 
- And the XXX at the end? 
- Clear as mud. 
- See you later. 
- These photographs are much more detailed. 
- Study them. 
- I've been on this for five days, I know them backwards. 
Know them frontwards too. This is your last chance. 
Grauman, always remember one thing, you're under contract to me. 
These are clean. 
One lighter. Box of matches. 
- You'd better drop me in the right place or else. 
- All right. 
- Put this on, it will make you feel better. 
- What is it? 
Tonic for your nerves. It's a thousand pounds. 
I hope it's all right. I don't like passing counterfeit. 
Sling me one of those, would you? 
May I have a cigarette, please? 
One last thing. 
If you're captured, take this. 
It's very effective. 
- It kills instantly. 
- Thank you, how touching(!) 
If I don't hear from you in three days, I'll write you off. 
- I'll be back in three days. 
- GUNFIRE 
- Safer up there than down here. 
- I'll bring Chapman. 
ENGINES HUM SOFTLY 
- Have we crossed the English Channel yet? 
- We have crossed it. 
ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE 
I thought I was unpopular, but this is ridiculous! 
Green light, stand by! 
BEEPING Position report, sir. 
BEEPING CONTINUES Aircraft...circling...dropping zone. 
Altitude... 
- Leo, go and tell the colonel. 
COWS MOO 
COCK CROWS 
HE KNOCKS DOG BARKS 
- Stop that noise! What do you want? 
- I'm a British airman. 
- May I use your telephone? 
- Telephone? 
- I've got to get to the police. 
It all checks, sir. 
This frequency was on our intercept list of enemy agents in Norway. 
Looks like he is telling the truth. 
Produce Eddie Chapman's criminal record I can answer any question. 
I'll be blunt. 
Our position is that the real Eddie Chapman was executed in Jersey. 
HE LAUGHS 
I dropped out of the sky up there to make a deal with you down here. 
But my bargaining position is getting weaker every second. 
This is the third day! 
Who'll be responsible for not buying some of the best intelligence? You will. 
Pretty uniforms and your old school ties. 
By having nerve, you got away with murder with your German friends. 
- But it's not going to work here. 
- It worked before, it can work again. 
If you try it on, you won't be allowed to transmit that message. 
Or you may find yourself back in prison for those 14 years. 
What do you have to say about that? 
Sir, I'd say... 
"It would all be a terrible waste." 
Hmm. 
Frankly, so would I. 
CLICKING 
Remember the three Xs. 
Oh, thank you. 
- If we don't hear anything, we'll try again. 
- Yes. 
BEEPING 
Blow up... 
Vickers... 
Thursday... hours. 
"Repeat 03.00 hours precisely for reconnaissance check. 
"Jolly Albert terra terra." What's that last bit? 
It's a private joke, one of the chaps is called Albert. 
- Spare us the details. 
- Right, sir. 
Reconnaissance check means they must be taking this seriously. 
- Or don't they trust you? 
- They'll have to if he does the job. 
You're not going to actually blow up Vickers. 
It'll be worthwhile if you fall in with what we have in mind for you. 
I'm always open to a proposition. 
Even if it means going back to the Germans? Working for us, this time. 
- This time on an exclusive basis. 
- Exclusive, that comes extra. 
At least you're consistent, Chapman. I'll say that. 
Going back there, my life will be in danger. 
It's in danger now. 
A man who drops into England by parachute with a German radio and the ID of a man who's been reported dead, you could hang. 
That's rather nasty. Not what I expected from British fair play. 
We've established that you're not going back for patriotic reasons, what else would interest you? 
Ł10,000. Half in advance, in cash. I don't trust banks, people keep robbing them. 
Ł10,000, that's all? 
A free pardon. 
And a nice, shiny medal like the one he's got on. 
It's a pleasure to do business. You know so clearly what you want. 
In case we don't through with this Vickers sabotage, 
- you were a guardsman, weren't you? 
- Mm-hmm. 
Your call-up papers for the army will be served on you by breakfast. 
Blackmail. This war has destroyed all moral values, really. 
I'm a pacifist. I'm against all wars. 
That makes two of us. 
Coming? 
Well, my instructions were precise. 
- Join in with the rest of the nightshift. 
- Stop, here. 
And go through one of the gates, like that one. 
'I was told to join in with the workers. Listen to what they say.' 
- Hello, Charlie! 
- Hello, Charlie! 
Hello, Bert! 
Hey, you! > 
Your cap. 
'You have to go to a washroom and hide there until midnight. 
'When there's a meal, join the mob again. 
'This gets you into the main factory area. 
'The next part's much worse. 
'One crewman told me the food is ghastly. He wasn't fooling. 
'My orders were then to follow the others out, staying till last. 
'The end building houses the generator - 
'the main dynamo that supplies power to the whole factory. 
'22 paces from the north corner of the building... 
'..plant your plastic explosive. 
'Insert the igniter. 
'Set your wrist-watch time fuse for a seven-hour delay. 
'My orders were then to go back to the washroom, 
'hide in there, until 6am when the night staff goes off. 
'Then, like the rest of them, make your way home. 
- Now, do you believe me? 
- Interesting, anyway. 
Sitting out here, I've been thinking. 
If I can persuade the War Cabinet would you do your part of the deal? 
What do you mean? 
Well, for instance, justice. 
Lord Beaverbrook has been held up by the Prime Minister, but he's on his way. He apologises. 
But speaking for the Ministry of Aircraft Production, 
I can only say that we would take a very dim view of your blowing up our biggest factory, as your memorandum suggests. 
We were keen to have him destroy the works to indicate that he's more successful than they thought. 
The problem is, if Chapman fails to carry out this mission, the Germans will know there's something fishy. 
- His value to us as an agent is destroyed. 
- I must confess my ignorance as to his activities here. 
However valuable his services, you can't expect the Ministry of Aircraft Production to allow a plant 
- to be put out of action for a whole month. 
- My friend, I have news. 
After I've seen Lord Beaverbrook, that's precisely what I do expect. 
First time a cop carried my tools to and from a job. 
- You'd make a good nightman. In prison, you'll be my first choice. 
- In business, you'll be mine. 
BELL 
EXPLOSION 
An unidentified aircraft in sight of the coast coming in at southeast minus ten. 
Thank you. 
Call all anti-aircraft battery, let the unidentified aircraft through. 
- It's one of ours back from mission. 
- No, sir. The aircraft is German. 
- You said it might be. So they are sending one? 
- It's just as I... 
TELEPHONE RINGS 
Battery 554 states the aircraft is out of range, continuing on its way. 
That's funny. 
It's even burning on the roofs we didn't go near. 
Someone else must have been smoking. 
Let's get back. 
Brigadier Dalrymple, 
WAAF officer, name unknown. 
Well, you seem to be very comfortable here. 
It's a bit racier than most prisons I know. 
This is Squadron Officer Laurence - one of our top camouflage people. 
She's proud of the work they did last night. Show him. 
Those false buildings on fire should have fooled the Germans. 
Ah! It's taken in the dark. 
- Yes - infrared film. 
- A-ha. 
You didn't tell me you did that much damage. 
So it looks to me and I'm an expert. 
- And this - taken not more than five minutes after the German plane had gone. 
- So his photos would be... 
- Similar to that one. 
- The factory - how long will that be out of action? 
The night shift will be on at midnight. 
Sir, they're calling Chapman on the radio. 
- Answer for me, will you? 
- They could identify your finger on the tapper. 
Take care of this. 
HE TAPS KEYS 
BEEPING 
No... 
..submarine possible. 
Proceed... 
Lisbon...by ship. 
Last message. 
That's funny. 
Good show, well done. 
Last message sounds like breaking off contact, doesn't it? 
I can't say I like it. 
I can't say I like it at all. 
There's a funny smell to it. Something's not quite right. 
It's because we're concerned for your welfare that we're having this talk. 
I'm not sure it's safe for you to go back. 
If it was made worth my while... 
The financial terms have already been agreed. 
Also the matter of the Distinguished Service Order - no. 
I wear it when I'm in uniform. I'm a snob about whoever else wears it. 
If you do go back now, it will be on my terms. 
The day of the private war of Eddie Chapman has come to an end. 
- Are you with me? 
- I'm not sure I'm WITH you, but I'm beginning to get what you have in mind. 
It lives 600ft down in the sea, between the rocks and it eats small fish and it's also fond of human flesh. 
So far, you've had it pretty good. 
You've been working for von Grunen - an old-school gentleman, but you're NOT working for a gentleman now. 
You've got to decide who's going to win this war and God help you if the Germans get to London. 
They'll find tons of official and secret documents in beautiful crumbling ashes. 
In a convenient fireplace in MI5, they'll find the half-burnt dossier of Edward Arnold Chapman. 
That half will be enough to get a rope round your neck or a bullet through your brain within the hour. 
I don't know what's happened to the British sense of justice. 
Well, all right. Now, remember the first 5,000. 
And no cheques. Hmm? 
Fine. 
We have to do is get you back to the Germans in the best condition. 
The first time here, you complained of your treatment. 
I told you, it was... 
It was be... 
- And the time of the train? 
- Just before six. I told you. 
Corridor or no corridor? 
- None, as I remember. 
- I want a definite answer. 
No corridor. 
Look, I'm tired now. 
I've got to get some sleep. 
Give him another drink - that should wake him. 
You'll take over in half an hour. 
- That film you saw the first night in London? 
- A pretty girl called... 
Sally, er... 
Grey and Anton Walbrook and er... 
Warsaw Concerto, that was the name, something like that. 
- Which cinema? 
- Marble Arch. 
- And the colour of your railway ticket to London? 
- White. 
- No, no - green, white's first-class. There is no first class on local railways. 
- One mistake like that with the real boys and you'll be a goner. 
- Please, 
- I've been here days. 
- 15 hours and they'll keep you 30 straight. 
- Make him finish the bottle. 
Grill him for another four hours. If he survives, it will be safe for him to catch the ship tomorrow night. 
Gentlemen, thank you. You've taught me one thing - never let the Polish catch you. 
And Chapman, in case we never meet again, I'm relying on you to do a good job. 
After all, you do represent a considerable investment. 
- HE GROANS 
- Now, sugar ration - 
- how many ounces a week? 
- Oh! 
- I adore you! 
- Why? 
Because you never, never change. 
I don't have time for backchat. 
- It was you in the black car? 
- Yes. 
- I had to reach you before Schnapps or Keller. 
- Where's von Grunen? 
- On the Russian front. 
- Russia? 
Why? 
Some say it was your doing. 
- Ah! 
- Senor? 
- Una manzanilla, por favor. 
What am I being blamed for now? 
Three of our best people in England were liquidated within days of your arrival. 
- The arm of coincidence can't be that long. You do follow? 
- Oh, yes. 
- You'll be interrogated for three days. I hope your story's good. 
- Yes. 
Neither of us can be safe 
- unless von Grunen is brought back and you can do it. 
- How? 
There's information that you can give to him. 
- No. But he owes me a lot of money. 
- Can you prove that? 
- It's in the contract. 
- As soon as they are satisfied at the chateau, 
- I might get the right people by telephone. 
- Agente provocatrice. 
Hey, you're working too hard. 
Why? 
Does it show? 
- Why don't you stop? This is a man's game. 
- Yes, I will stop. 
One must stop, sometimes. 
At the moment, I have to be clever. 
Let's both be clever. 
DOORBELL 
This way. 
Come in. 
You are Franz Grauman? 
Unless you're the military attache, no I'm not. 
Whatever I am is not your business. 
You will please go to that table and write down all of your activity from when you arrived in England. 
You will omit nothing. 
You both seem overjoyed to see me. 
Of course we are. 
Welcome back. 
There's only one Franz Grauman - he's the man. 
He hasn't changed, not one bit. 
At least life will be more gay at the chateau now he's back. 
Just when we'd given him up forever. 
- Given me up? 
- I never thought you'd dare come back after all that has happened. 
- Well, why not? 
- It takes courage to do what you are doing now. 
Walking into the lion's den like this. 
Well... 
I've come back for my money. 
- What money? 
- 100,000 marks the baron owes me. 
- Who is no longer with us. 
May no longer be with anybody. 
Conditions on the Eastern Front are appalling. 
- This is defeatist talk. 
- Yes, all right. 
Everybody knows that our glorious armed forces are winning victory after victory on the Eastern Front. 
A few more triumphs and we'll be fighting in Berlin itself. 
- Colonel Steinhager, please. 
- Yes. 
In the meantime, put down on paper your experiences in England. 
It should make fascinating reading. 
Omitting nothing. 
- You have time? 
- Oh yes, we have time. 
After all, time is on our side, isn't it? 
Your possibility of political asylum has been lost, Franz. 
We have crossed the border. 
I don't know what you're getting at. 
You were in neutral territory. Now you're not. 
- Franz, come on. 
- Eddie. 
Good luck. 
- Heil Hitler. 
- Heil Hitler. 
Heil Hitler. 
For you. 
Oh, yes. They are waiting. 
- They have been waiting quite a time. They don't like to wait. 
- Come on. 
Come on! 
- What is it, huh? 
- Is there somewhere I can...? 
- Bathroom through there. 
KNOCK AT DOOR 
Grauman! 
Open this door! 
- KNOCKING CONTINUES 
- All right. 
What's the matter with you? You look terrible. 
I had no food I suppose. 
Drink this. A man must put something into his stomach. 
I know someone who was just about to. 
Grauman. 
OK, gentlemen, that is about all for now. We shall discuss this later. 
Take these papers. 
Go on. 
Field Marshall Rundstedt, may I present to you Lieutenant Special Service Franz Grauman? 
They told me your story. I've been looking forward to meeting you.

"To Lieutenant Special Service Franz Grauman 
"for successful achievements on behalf of the German Army, 
"culminating in an exploit that resulted in the destruction of the Vickers Aircraft factory in England. 
"At personal risk, and requiring specialised skills. Your award is made herewith of the Iron Cross. 
"In the name of the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. 
"It is worthy of further notice that Grauman is the first Englishman to become a recipient of this honour." 
In the name of the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler. 
Now that you have been promoted to Lieutenant, the first thing you need is a visit to my tailor, 
- and a different uniform. 
- That's very kind of you. 
Is there anything else you want? Anything I can do for you? 
Well, yes, I... I don't quite know how to put it. 
There is, actually. 
There most certainly is. 
- We're glad to see you back, sir. 
- No need for speeches. I'm glad to be back. 
Your buttons need shining. 
I think that includes all my personal documents. 
These are the files on the general administration. 
Thank you, Steinhager. I'm sorry to make you clear everything out. 
It's better to start off the way I intend to continue. 
How did you get a hold of this? 
- What? 
- This aerial photo. 
What is it an aerial photo of, Franz? Tell us. 
And where have you seen it before? Hmm? Tell us. 
It's the Vickers factory of course. 
Look, I spent four days learning the layout, looking at pictures... in this very room. 
I've seen it before. 
No, Franz. Pictures, drawings, but not aerial photographs. 
And certainly not aerial photographs of a factory on fire. 
Don't you think you have made a dangerous little slip-up this time? 
Hmm? Don't you? 
- My English friend. 
- Oh, give over, Steinhager. You're getting as nutty as Keller. 
- Once a policeman, always a policeman. Is that how the saying goes? 
- Yes. 
And it doesn't make me angry, as you would like it to. 
I am proud of being a policeman and grateful. We policeman have to be kept on no matter what the regime. 
Whether Germany is ruled by an emperor or communists or national socialists, the state needs policemen 
- and the policeman is asking you one more question! 
- Hurry it up, then! 
You said, "How on earth did you get hold of this?!" 
As if it were surprising for us, the Germans, to have this picture. 
Why would you ask that if you had seen this picture before, 
- when you were studying here? Why? 
- It's meant to be of the highest security rating, kept in a safe. 
Now they're flogging them around for one and all to see. 
- Until the baron returned, 
- I 
- was in charge! I wasn't one and all. 
Oh, Franz, you disappoint me. 
- You disappoint me that you cannot think of anything better! 
- Steinhager... if you feel so strongly that you have a case against Grauman, then you must make a formal charge, press for an investigation. 
But if you are wrong... it will be your responsibility. 
- Are you willing to take the risk? 
- What would be the use? Franz seems to have friends in...high places. 
No, it's just that I am disappointed professionally. 
Cruelly disappointed. 
That is the first time I feel sympathy for that man. 
And, of course, he is right... he's bound to survive. 
- Why him? 
- He's doing his job... he enjoys it. That's what makes him dangerous. 
Ah, well, Baron... welcome home. 
CAR HORN BEEPS 
BEEPING CONTINUES 
This certainly is not the German army that conquered Poland, Norway and France in under one year of war. 
No, it certainly isn't. 
Strange. 
I am part of this army... and yet I like to think of myself as a pacifist. 
I'm a pacifist myself. 
I wonder, Eddie... all the time I wonder... what you really are. 
Helene, a packet of Gauloises, s'il vous plait. 
More champagne, I think, don't you? 
Garcon! 
I'm afraid I'll have to leave you. Those friends of mine in the corner, I cannot keep them waiting. 
Fearfully top army echelon, are they? 
- Bring him another bottle and when he has finished that, put him in a taxi and send him to his hotel. 
- Yes. 
I'll see you in the morning. 
- You look so sad and lonely. 
- I'm a sad and lonely type. 
Then don't you think...? 
YOU push off. I was here first. 
- Bonsoir. 
- She doesn't belong here! 
- Run, don't walk. 
I know I'm late. I'm sorry. Your telegram was difficult to deliver. And now...I have another name. 
- Oh. Legally. 
- Yes. My husband's name. 
- Why did you want to see me? 
- To ask you the time. 
And what else? 
Well...the last time I saw you, you had friends with you. Remember? 
Friends in the Resistance. 
I'm not trying to trap you, believe me. I need help. 
- Help from the French underground. I've got to... 
- < CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS 
- I must have radio communication with England. 
- I can't possibly... 
You don't have to admit to anything, just listen. Suppose you knew someone in the Resistance... and suppose he checked up on me with London...when he found out I was all right, he could contact me. 
If I knew such people, what would you want to tell them? 
Take a look at that table in the corner. 
- One of those generals is Field Marshall Von Kluge. The colonel with him is Von Grunen. 
- Meaning what? 
Von Grunen is using me as a cover to attend that meeting over there. 
Today is Tuesday. I only buy books on Fridays and Saturdays. 
..So the names really do mean something to you. 
Do me a favour, will you? 
Get me in touch with England by radio. And then do me another? 
Right afterwards... get out of this business. 
Deux cents francs, monsieur. 
At eight o'clock. At the bistro called Les Bons Nuits, rue Lamartine. 
Eight o'clock? 
Merci, monsieur. 
Let me know straight away. 
Well? 
We'll come back in a few minutes. 
Le rouge? 
Paulette? 
Bonsoir. 
Raymond! 
- Raymond. 
- Coming. 
Salut. 
- Can we talk here? 
- Mmm. Nowhere safer. 
- Got me cleared with London? 
- If you have something to say, I may be able to get it across there. 
- You're taking an awful risk, talking like that. Openly. 
- That's the secret. The trick. 
Talk openly. I can deny anything. 
You have a grudge against me, maybe? 
Or you want me out of the way for some reason? 
Now, is there still something you want to tell me? 
I could've used somebody like you back in the good old days. 
- I'll tell you fast. 21st Panzer and the 19th Light have arrived in France. 
- How do you know? 
- The generals were at dinner... 
- Yes? 
- Paris, on Tuesday night. 
Something pretty funny going on among those generals. The regular army ones, I mean. 
It involves a senior officer on the general... 
I might have known. 
Keller! 
I'm surprised to see you here, disreputable dive like this. 
I'm not surprised to see YOU, however. 
Everybody seems to have his hands in his pockets. 
- HE TUTS 
- What is it, a raid or something? 
But you take your hands OUT of your pocket. 
Bit jumpy, aren't you, Keller? What seems to be bothering you? 
- Cigarette? 
- You are under arrest. 
Oh, Captain, you need your head examined! 
- I received your telephone message. I came as soon as I could. 
- Sorry, it turns out it was a false alarm. 
He got away. And you...? What are you doing here? 
It's a coincidence. They happened to walk in. Isn't that right? 
As Grauman says, sir... A false alarm. 
I don't know what's happening here, but I intend to find out. 
It had better be important enough to take me from a dinner with the Colonel General! Back to your hotel. 
- Stay there until I send for you. 
- Yes, sir. 
- We have a rendezvous tomorrow evening. Don't miss it. 
Now it's you! 
A telephone message. 
It's from you? 
Better ask Grauman! 
He seems to be the only one who knows what's going on. 
Night, all. 
Leave your coat here. I'll sign for both of us. ..Evening! 
Ah, my dear cousin, THIS is your celebrated protege. 
- Good evening, gentlemen. 
- Fuhrer! 
- How's your father? Haven't seen him for years! Is he keeping well? 
- Quite well, sir. 
- We must all keep well! 
- Colonel General, may I present Lieutenant Special Services, Franz Grauman. 
- Good evening. 
- Heil Hitler! 
- Mm. 
Extraordinary how things have changed, isn't it? Instead of "Heil Hitler", he grunts. 
- Colonel Steinhager! - Ja? 
Nobody is to go in or out until the meeting is quite over. No exceptions, sir? 
None. That's an order. 
Looks like we're in for a very rough night, my friends! 
I say no, no and no. The last mission was entirely for the benefit of the Luftwaffe. 
- This time the Kriegsmarine must have a chance! - Grauman belongs to the Army! 
- The Navy is the senior of all the services! 
- Yes, and the smallest. 
My dear Admiral, and esteemed friend, your argument is very weak. 
This meeting is going to last a week. 
< Shan't sleep for a week as it is! 
LOUD DISCUSSION > My God, the Luftwaffe are going to bomb the Navy! OUR Navy! 
- < I said that it's impossible! 
- They're running out of steam already. 
- I am just waiting for the right moment. 
- Lower your voices! 
You can be heard halfway across Paris! 
General Schuler is in there! I demand he receives this message! 
My entire career could be destroyed! An SS general being refused a communique?! 
You know our instructions! I must insist. 
Insist?! You INSIST?! 
Sit down at once! 
I may not be SS, but by God, 
I will court-martial you for disobeying orders! 
Give it to me. 
Any minute now. 
It doesn't look as though that is going to work out either. 
- The only solution for this is a mission that will have something for each of them. 
- So it seems! 
- Have you a suggestion? 
- In England, Colonel General, near Portsmouth, five heavy bomber stations are airfields for quite specific targets in Germany. Planes from Lakenheath always bomb Hamburg. And Manston has Berlin for a target. 
- We need a man in the Portsmouth area... 
- Exactly. A man to radio us which airfield they leave from. 
The Luftwaffe could then concentrate its night fighters over the target area. 
From intelligence, bulletin 317, we have reports of another American army to be formed in England, possibly under General Patton, 
- in the same Portsmouth area. 
- Identify this US army successfully, and we can arrange something more interesting than Iron Cross work! 
Gentlemen, this sugestion of General von Grunen is inspired! 
We've been talking for hours at cross purposes and now we have a plan of action for our valuable English associate. 
Have you no comment to make on this? 
When am I going to get any sleep? 
- LAUGHTER 
- Right now because I am going. 
Open the windows, please. We need some fresh air. 
When you see your father - he was my divisional commander - 
- tell him from me that his son would certainly equal his achievements. 
- I'll tell him. Thank you. 
It's difficult to be both a solider and a diplomat. Good night, or good morning rather, gentlemen. 
- You did not want to be disturbed, sir. 
- You carried out your orders well. 
- These messages are important. 
They are very important, sir. I can tell you what it is. 
The Allies... the Allies have landed in Normandy. 
- HE LAUGHS 
- Anything wrong? 
I don't know. It seems in order. 
The only thing is the money must be in a Swiss bank in dollars, all 100,000 of them. 
I can't blame you. We've lost the war now. It's only a matter of time. 
- Sh-sh-sh. 
- Microphones. 
No-one cares any more. Everybody says it. 
Hitler has been interfering so much with army strategy, Von Rundstedt has asked to be replaced. 
- Von Kluge is taking over. 
- Ah, who was in the night club with him. 
I didn't tell you it was Von Kluge. 
Some time ago, that remark of yours might have got you into a lot of trouble. 
Now, who cares? Your copy of the signed contract. 
They're not serious about sending me on this job, are they? 
V1s and V2s, that's all the madman has left up his sleeve. 
Secret weapons. 
ARTILLERY FIRE 
How far are they? 
About 35 miles. 
American Third Army will be here in less than a week. 
Well, I'll be in Paris tomorrow. 
Anything I can get you? 
No. I have an aircraft waiting. 
It's an important journey for me. 
- Your radio frequencies. 
- What was that? 
Your radio frequencies. 
- You'll memorise them before you leave. 
- I'll learn them. 
Wish I was going with you. 
The Countess going back to Sweden, you to England, the place won't be the same. 
- Not with the American and British soldiers around, it won't. 
- I mean... AIRCRAFT OVERHEAD 
- Did you see that? Free French. 
- I'm not particular. We're late. I want to celebrate my last night in Paris. 
SHOUTING 
SOFT MUSIC PLAYS 
When it ends, and it will end, what will you do? 
- If I survive? 
- Oh, you'll survive. 
As I will. We're both professional survivors. 
In that case, I'll just go on doing what I like best. 
Which is? 
Looking at pretty things. 
If you ever go to Sweden... 
Wouldn't work. 
Well, we could try. 
Oh... are we too much alike? 
Let's just say... we're very much alike. 
Steinhager's here. 
Vous restez, monsieur? What? 
Can we stop dancing? I don't enjoy it with him watching. 
- Table? 
- No, no. 
Ah! 
Charming! 
- Charming. It makes my heart feel young again just to watch you. 
- First you'll have to steal a heart. 
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Franz... 
And the last time we shall be together, huh? 
- You've come for me rather early. 
- They are getting anxious at the airfield, and no Von Grunen. 
Do you know where he is? 
Come on. 
- You coming? 
- I've had too many farewells in my time. 
I'll miss you, Helga. 
It's nice to know you remember my name. 
I WILL miss you. 
Just go. I'll have a little more wine. 
- STEINHAGER LAUGHS Ah, Keller! 
- I was worried about you. 
- I thought they'd sent you to the Russian front. 
- Worry about yourself. 
- I didn't know you cared(!) 
- Colonel, fog is closing in. As soon as you're ready... 
- We are coming. 
- I'd like to have seen the baron. 
- So would we all. 
- 'Achtung. Achtung. 
'This is an important announcement. 
'The Fuhrer is well. The Fuhrer is not dead as reported...' Gott! 
'..by traitors who seized Radio Stuttgart illegally. 
'There has been an attempt on the life of our glorious Fuhrer by some treacherous senior officers. 
'But in less than one hour, the Fuhrer himself will speak to you. 
'Stay tuned to this station.' MILITARY MUSIC PLAYS 
- I suppose that cancels MY trip. 
- There's no order cancelling it... 
Grauman must wait. 
Oh, come on, make up your minds. You heard what the pilot said. 
That's right. Grauman's mission is urgent. These filthy traitors shouldn't affect you. 
Come on - the cars are waiting. 
Be ready as soon as I send for you. 
Look after yourself, Steinhager. I don't want to come back and find you listed as missing in action. 
Always the joker, Franz! Always the joker. 
Franz! There's one thing I must ask you. Are you...? 
SCREECHING OF TYRES 
I know - I heard. 
- Already? 
- On the radio. 
We're doomed. When the aristocracy of the German army cannot even blow up one single room at a given time, we deserve to lose. 
PLANE ENGINE REVS 
Ja, danke schon, danke schon. Later! 
Look, Eddie! Look, Eddie! Tell me one thing. I have to know for myself. 
You ARE a British agent, aren't you? 
- AREN'T you? 
- When did you guess? 
MARCHING 
Colonel Von Grunen, you are under arrest. 
I resist arrest, Steinhager. 
You resist arrest, sir? 
You know what your orders are, if I resist arrest. 
I command you to carry out your orders! 
GUNSHOT 
It wasn't necessary. 
Somebody else would have done it for us. 
Aerial reconnaissance is practically out of existence, but thanks to your security, the German high command have no idea where the V1s are landing or what effect they're having. 
My mission is to report the time and position of each explosion, so they can correct their aim and drop the maximum load on London. 
They don't know what a hell of a time they've been giving us?! 
Well, gentlemen, let's call the backroom boys together and work out a plan. 
We supply the Germans with information AND divert all their secret weapons. 
1500 hours. Five bombs - 51 degrees, 15 minutes north, 
0 degrees, 10 minutes west. 
Pass to you for translating into decoy information. 
False reading as follows - 51 degrees, 7 minutes north, 
0 degrees, 5 minutes west. 
That should fool them all right. Now, put this up on the board. 
CLICKING 
There you are. 
- Good evening, Braid. 
- Evening, sir. Everything's in order. 
Parker! How's it going? 
I THINK we're pulling it off, sir. 
The bombs all seem to be gradually moving north. 
Let's cheer them up. Let's tell them that one was Selfridge's. 
CHEERING 
Smithson 37 - beautiful model! 
Three minutes to crack that back in the old days. 
Those were the OLD days. Now that you've got your free pardon, you'd better keep it that way. 
Have you got the Molyneux robbery down and the post office at Bromley? 
Hey! Where's my record? 
There's nothing here at all! This doesn't make the pardon legal. 
It's legal. Read it! Anything before 1945 - you're in the clear. 
I'd better be! 
Now that it's all over, I can tell you something else. 
- Your own criminal record - your dossier - went up in the Blitz. 
- What? 
A bomb dropped on the records office - everything A to E written off! 
You mean...before I landed here the first time? 
You mean I went through all this...? 
I risked my life...! 
- Oh, why the hell did I get mixed up in all this? 
- Say, Eddie...? 
- Mmm? 
Tell us something. Which side were you REALLY on? 
You mean you don't know?
Thank you.
Tonight, we celebrate with dancing and wine.
Then I'll ready my boat.
And between breakfast and readying your boat...
...I want you to kill everyone on Blefuscu.
But Lilliput is safe.
- I said, kill them!
- We've won. Isn't that enough?
Then force them to open their eggs at the little end.
No, I will not degrade anyone.
We don't need vengeance.
I need it!
On to the banquet.
How dare that man disobey you!
He didn't disobey.
His Majesty didn't insist.
I never had to insist before.
It's unheard of.
- Disgraceful.
- Humiliating.
I'm never humiliated.
But it was disgraceful.
- He won the war.
- He shamed the army and navy.
What's war without death?
Where's the sacrifice beyond the call of duty? The heroism?
I move the prime minister suggest a way...
...to dispose of this freak.
Well, Reldresal?
If we kill him, there would be a danger of an epidemic.
- The navy could float him out to sea.
- Too big. Cost too much.
I have it!
We'll send him to Blefuscu and have them kill him.
Superb idea, Your Majesty.
That way, he's their problem.
It may not be nice, but it's legal.
What if they decide to use him against us?
Shame! Shame! Shame!
How can you plot against Gulliver?
Now, dear, don't get excited.
Nobody's plotting.
You can't fool me. Criers are out proclaiming your kindness.
That means someone will be executed.
- Gulliver wouldn't do my bidding!
- That's no excuse for killing him!
Listen.
Such a sweet, gentle song...
...for such a big, powerful man.
- But I sing, and much better.
- Be quiet!
If he'd made a fool of you, you wouldn't be swaying like a maiden.
- You'd be spitting nails at him.
- Such vanity. Such vanity!
Nothing he does can offend me.
Fire!
Put out the fire!
Stay where you are. I'll put it out.
The uncouth, vile, filthy, evil, dirty spitting and spewing animal.
As I said, madam. As I said.
Destroy him. He's ruined my dress.
Destroy him!
- Precisely the way we all feel.
- Execute him.
Brilliant!
You're a man of action, Flimnap.
You're accused of treason. Flee!
- The emperor's mad.
- Executioners are coming.
Treason? But I saved Lilliput.
I was even decorated.
You made Galbet jealous. The admiral hates you for scuttling the fleet.
The empress is furious.
You ruined her dignity and her dress.
I stop wars, put out fires, feed people...
...give them hope, peace and prosperity. How can I be a traitor?
Treason, man, treason.
The emperor hates you because you're more important than he is.
Petty ambition, selfish people.
Go to freedom and eggs the way you want them.
- I never eat eggs.
- Neither do I. It's the principle.
You caused trouble, endangered your daughter, to win a point?
You promised the giant would solve our problems.
He will. You're the biggest.
Make everyone open eggs your way.
No one's big enough to stop your bickering.
It poisons everything.
Make them think like you.
That will end bickering and war.
Don't you see?
Then I'd be just like the emperor.
And so would you.
Using my strength to oppress others.
- Treason!
- False pride and vanity.
They destroy everything for lovers.
Elizabeth was right.
The only safety is in being obscure, in being nothing.
- Down with force and power.
- Kill him!
Call the guards!
Please, I need your help.
Halt!
- I must show this to the king.
- See the king's chamberlain.
- Welcome to Brobdingnag.
- Don't be frightened. You're safe.
Is that his name? Gulliver?
Yes, my dear. He belongs to Elizabeth.
She's told us all about him.
Now they're the prized possessions of your king.
I know how highly you value these little people, but I must warn you.
Little people are shrunken people, and shrunken people are dangerous.
Makovan, shrunken people are little and little people are toys.
And no one in the entire land of Brobdingnag has them except me.
Take your Gulliver inside.
He needs food and rest.
And the court tailor will make him new clothes.
You're going to be very rich, my girl.
Very rich.
- What did you say your name was, dear?
- Glumdalclitch.
There you are. That will keep your family happy for years.
I don't wanna sell him.
I brought him because law says:
" Little people should be brought to the palace at once."
That's quite right.
Only the king can own little people.
But he's mine. I found him.
My dear child, I've got a surprise for you. Come along with me.
What do you think of these?
My collection of the tiniest animals in the world.
- They're very nice.
- Nice?
It's the most unusual collection ever.
Come see my favourite.
See this tiny crocodile?
He's the fiercest fighting flesh of his size in captivity. Watch.
See how he snaps at it?
That's why we keep him alone.
He'd kill the others instantly.
Now, as a reward...
...l'll give you any of these animals, except my crocodile.
I don't want any. I want my Gulliver.
Come now, girl. Don't be stubborn.
Your king knows best.
He's a king for grownups. Children don't have a king to protect them.
I'm everybody's king.
You take things from children, like all grownups.
They never ask. They just take.
Why not let her stay here? She'll be an excellent guardian for them.
All right. Then I'll decree...
...that your parents let you live here. See? I'm your king too.
Thank you.
I'll protect them with my life!
I'll show you your room, and we'll get you a lovely new dress.
Pages, bring the castle.
You never saw anything of Pritchard or the crew?
After the Antelope sank,
I washed ashore here.
Let's hope that they were saved too.
I never stopped believing you were alive. Not for a moment.
When I think of what those little people might have done to you!
They were vain and selfish.
You're so right.
Wanting to be important and powerful is meaningless.
Our being together is all the importance we ever needed.
- Wait!
- Are you all right?
It's Glumdalclitch, the little girl who found you.
- How do you do? And thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm going to sleep now, but if you want anything, just call.
Good night, dear.
Isn't this a beautiful place?
And no mortgage, either.
It's a paradise compared to Wapping.
I don't care where we are as long as we're together and safe.
- You got your strength back fast.
- Giant food agrees with me.
No, don't. We're not married yet.
Elizabeth, open the door.
Elizabeth!
Glumdalclitch, wake up!
- Wake the king. We want to be married.
- Now? But everyone's asleep.
Fetch the king, please.
All right. Stop shouting.
Grownups are silly. And little grownups are sillier than anybody.
Wake up in there! Wake up!
Why arouse everyone?
They want a simple ceremony.
If I have to be up in the middle of the night, so does everybody.
- You forgot your slippers.
- I want to do this and go to sleep.
Don't be so grumpy, dear.
Remember carrying me off by moonlight?
How impetuous you were!
How the fires of passion stirred you!
I wish they'd stir now.
It's cold in these halls.
- Please, Your Majesty.
- Yes, all right.
- Where are they?
- There, King Brob.
Pages, get the fire going.
These stones are cold.
They'll be a delightful couple.
Charming!
Forgive me for disturbing you.
Quite all right.
You sure you know what you're doing?
None of your jokes.
You're making them nervous.
They're supposed to be nervous.
Where's the licence?
Where'd they go, the little lovers?
For shame! Shame on all of you!
Stop this nonsense.
Marry them at once.
You're right, dear.
I'd better marry them at once.
I pronounce you man and wife by the authority vested in me, by me.
Live happily, long life, lots of children, that sort of thing.
He should kiss the bride.
He is, dear.
And now, can we go back to bed?
Wake up. Wake up, sleepyheads.
It's morning.
"On our honeymoon. Be back soon.
Love, Elizabeth and Lemuel Gulliver."
Oh, dear. No!
Darling, if we're gone too long,
Glumdalclitch might get into trouble.
She's a big girl. A very big girl.
She can take care of herself.
No more cares. No more worries.
Not a one. I only have to keep you happy, and I'll work hard to do it.
Work? What for?
- To get money to buy food.
- We get all our food free.
- Then, to pay taxes, at least.
- But there are no taxes on us.
- Then to save money for our family.
- The king will give us money.
Yes, but... I guess so.
I don't have a thing to worry about for the rest of my life.
Gulliver? Elizabeth?
Where are you? Answer me!
Elizabeth, here I am!
Down here!
Glumdalclitch, hurry. Over here.
- There you are. Where's Gulliver?
- Here I am!
Down here.
Down here!
- Don't run away again.
- Thank you for saving me.
- Why did you run away?
- We didn't run away.
When you're grown up... become an adult, you'll understand.
- You could have been killed.
- We won't do it again.
I love you both, but you must do what I say.
You must behave, or the king won't let me stay with you.
I have to take you back right now.
The queen is terribly worried.
You upset the queen.
- You cannot leave without permission.
- Where did you go?
On our honeymoon. Your country is as beautiful as England.
- We won't go out alone again.
- Sensible. She will take care of you.
- I can take care of Elizabeth.
- Good! I like little men with spunk.
There. Let's see the alchemist find a formula to get him out of that.
A clever move, sire.
He'll take your rook if you move there.
- I beg your pardon?
- I shouldn't have interfered.
You play chess?
- Quite often.
- He's very good.
Let's see how good he is.
Take over Makovan's game.
- May I study the board?
- Of course.
I'm ready, Your Majesty.
That's a strange move.
Really? I'd like to know more about him.
- What were you in your little country?
- I was a doctor.
A witchery doctor.
No, Makovan. A bodily doctor.
Baying at the moon or waving a cat won't cure a bladder ailment.
Stop that jabbering. It's my move.
Ridiculous. Impossible.
I can take your...
No, then you could take my...
This isn't a judging game.
You'd better let him win.
You win.
He can't help it if he's a bright man.
It isn't like you to be a bad loser.
He didn't lose. A witch tricked him into making false moves.
But I couldn't have been beaten by such a tiny witch.
Maybe he wasn't always small.
A witch can make himself any size he wants.
Have you seen the way he kisses that woman of his?
Witches aren't interested in that sort of thing.
Precisely.
Do married people kiss so happily?
Always, all the time?
You have a point there, Makovan.
My stomach!
Oh, it hurts!
Makovan, get me some herbs quickly.
They're angry with us.
Teatime's past, and they always invited me.
Is that the price? Loss of dignity?
- Losing the game isn't losing dignity.
- It's pretending to be stupid.
- You could try to humour them.
- I could educate them.
They're backward, they're in the Middle Ages.
Don't change them. That'd spoil everything. We're happy here.
- We can't be when we're nobodies.
- Try to be equal, they'll hate us.
If I don't, they'll laugh.
They laugh enough, they'll get bored.
Then they'll stop laughing.
Since that's all we're here for, they'll get rid of us.
- The queen is ill.
- When? We just left her.
I saw them carry her to her quarters.
- Who's caring for her?
- Makovan.
- She needs a doctor.
- No, please.
- She's healthy. She just eats too much.
- Please wait!
Take me to Makovan's laboratory.
I can't do that. The king won't allow it. It's forbidden.
Do as I say!
It's an evil place filled with Makovan's magic.
- I'll turn his magic into medicine.
- No! You'll be killed.
Don't worry. It's our best chance to live happily ever after forever.
Take me there.
This will soothe you. My special formula made of spirits of theriac.
- It's too hot, you fool!
- It must be hot, Your Majesty.
It's not helping her, Makovan.
Try another formula.
King Brob? Please, King Brob.
Let Dr. Gulliver help her.
What are you doing here?
Go away, child.
Just relax. I'm a physician, a doctor. I'll help you.
I'm dying.
You're not dying.
You merely have an upset stomach.
But it aches so.
I have prepared a solution of laudanum, a paregoric.
- Drink it and you'll feel better.
- Are you sure?
I know it will cure you.
I'm staking my life on it.
As a physician, I wish I could take madam's hand and soothe her.
Yes, doctor.
The medicine is on the table.
Drink it down like a good girl.
Yes, doctor.
She's calling for him.
She's losing her mind.
No, he's going to help her.
He's a doctor.
Help her? That little witch?
Where is he?
- Put it down! No, no!
- Away.
- All of it, madam!
- Yes, doctor.
He's poisoned her.
She needed help on the inside, not the outside.
There he is!
Catch him!
Stop it!
I feel better already.
- Are you sure?
- The pain's completely gone.
You gave me the scare of my life.
All of you leave.
I wish to consult with Gulliver.
You may leave too, dear.
Gulliver will be safe here with me.
I said I'd like a few minutes alone with my physician.
- Your what?
- My doctor.
Dr. Gulliver.
I can care for you.
Get rid of that man.
You didn't save my life. He did.
- I'm your husband.
- I want my doctor.
All right then. I'll take my doctor.
Dr. Makovan, come with me.
I told you he was a witch, sire.
Shall I burn him?
It's not fair to burn a witch without proving it.
Do you want me to burn him, then prove him a witch?
Or shall I prove it, then burn him?
I don't want the queen upset.
That's what I want.
Then I shall prove him first, and then burn him later.
Is that what you wish?
Must I always tell you what to do?
Show a little initiative.
- Can I watch you make him a witch?
- I'm not making him a witch.
- Can I watch you make him a witch?
- I'm not making him a witch.
He is one, I'll just prove it.
Can I watch? Are you going to burn him afterward?
Witches are always burned at midnight, after your bedtime.
- I was told to bring Gulliver.
- Yes. Just put him on the table.
Not with that cat here.
I'd better keep him in my basket.
The thing's a doll!
- You sent for me? Can I be of service?
- Perhaps.
This is my daughter, Shrike.
Darling, this is Glumdalclitch, guardian of this...
He's not a doll! He's my little man.
I'm not big enough to be your father, but I'm old enough.
He's silly looking and squeaks like a mouse.
You're jealous because you don't have one.
Now, girls. You both go outside and play.
King Brob told me never to leave Gulliver.
Out, I said. There'll be honey cakes and milk for you later.
It's all right. We have grownup scientific matters to discuss.
- What substance is that?
- Air, water, fire and earth.
Plus the spirits of alchemy?
- Mercury, sulphur, arsenic.
- You know those?
- Chemists know our debt to magicians.
- You know magic?
They called it magic when trying to change iron into gold.
- We call it chemistry now.
- You know how to make gold from iron?
It's easier to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.
You can do that?
How did you know?
Stop that! Girls!
Stop that. Stop that, I say!
Easy. Daddy loves his little baby.
There, there.
He'll put you in the tanks! You'll turn blue! Lt'll prove you're a witch.
- He'll kill you.
- Don't worry. I can handle it.
Everyone he says is a witch, they turn blue in those magic waters.
What did you do?
You're not a witch, are you?
No, Glumdalclitch.
There, there, my sweet.
Leave her alone, you bully.
Sit here and watch me turn him blue.
Then can I stay up late and see the fire?
Turn blue? An innocent man?
A shrivelled man who beats the king at chess...
...cures the queen and makes a silk purse from a sow's ear must turn blue.
Climb down into that pan.
That's enough.
Get in the next one.
- Climb out, Gulliver.
- Yes, sir.
He didn't turn blue!
- Incredible!
- Merely a chemical reaction.
This contains lichen, which eats algae.
Anyone stepping into lichen and then into an alkaline, must turn blue.
- But you're red.
- Of course.
I changed the alkaline to acid.
Acid will then turn anything red.
Amazing witchery.
It's still colourless.
It's the same as your experiment.
It will turn you red.
Never!
Gulliver, the cat!
My cat! You've turned her red.
There, there, my sweet.
Daddy didn't do it, the witch did it.
Your hair will turn red!
Sure as science, and I'm not a witch.
It's turning!
It is, Daddy. It's red.
Your hair.
Little witch, you'll make a short but colourful flame.
Where does he get such power? To turn my hair red, to cure the queen?
Where does he get such power? To turn my hair red, to cure the queen?
I say destroy the witch, sire, before he destroys us.
- It wasn't magic!
- He's not a witch!
Invisible spirits. Evil spirits.
You turned Makovan's hair red.
- Only because I know chemistry.
- There's no such thing, or I'd know.
- No one knows it all.
- What he doesn't know, doesn't exist!
Brobdingnaggians are the wisest people in the world.
And I'm their king, understand?
Admit you never beat me at chess.
By fair means, I mean.
If I deny what I know, what I see and what I hear...
...then I deny all knowledge.
- And if the queen gets another ache?
- That has nothing to do with this!
Get that through your little thick head!
Deny anything they want, say anything! Save yourself.
I can't live without you.
Open the cage.
I'm ready to confess everything.
Confess, then.
I confess that the sun goes round the Earth.
I confess that the world is flat.
I confess that there is no such thing as...
...medicine or science.
And it would take a witch to beat me at chess.
It would take a witch.
Now he's more guilty than ever.
There was no medicine, so he cured the queen with nothing.
Only a witch could do that.
We must burn him.
I'm afraid we must. I'm sorry.
You promised I would be spared.
You lied!
You wear an ignorant's fear.
What you don't know, you destroy.
- Burn him!
- No!
Wait. I have a better way to destroy a witch.
Remarkable idea, sire.
There won't even be an ash remaining.
Go back to bed, child.
She must be spared.
She's done nothing.
- They are both alike.
- On with it!
Leave her there for now.
Open the door of the cage.
Dr. Gulliver! Take this!
- That's it! That's it!
- Come on!
Kill him! Get him, get him!
Hit him again!
- Kill him!
- Finish it!
Come on, kill him!
Come on, get him!
See what powers he has? The strength of a dozen his size. Burn him.
Gulliver! Elizabeth!
- After them!
- Come on!
- Don't let them get away!
- Stop them!
They're coming.
Where shall I hide you?
You can't stay here.
Animals will eat you.
You can't do anymore. Save yourself!
Where are they?
Where did you hide them?
I don't know!
Leave the child alone.
They're somewhere here. Find them.
They must be somewhere here.
- We can't let them escape.
- Set light to the brush!
We're going to die here.
If only I'd listened to you!
If only I hadn't tried to make you live my way.
If only I hadn't wanted everything my way.
There, at the stream.
Hurry! Into the basket.
Where are we?
I don't know.
Was it a dream?
As real as anything we think.
But the giants.
What if the giants come back?
They're always with us, the giants and the Lilliputians.
Inside us.
Their terrible world waiting to take our lives...
...waiting for us to make a mistake.
To be selfish again.
How can we bear it?
How can we live with such fear?
With love.
The way Glumdalclitch did.
Glumdalclitch. What happened to her?
She's waiting to be born.
Yes.
We're back in our world!
Pardon me. We're lost.
Perhaps you've heard of our country from a soldier or sailor.
- We come from far-off England.
- A town called Wapping.
Are you barmy? This is England.
And Wapping's just beyond that wood.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

- Is that the island of Haleakaloha?
- Yep.
- We ain't stopping, huh?
- Nope.
When I signed on, you promised we'd be at Haleakaloha by the seventh.
Well, this is the seventh.
What do you know?
Me, Boats Gilhooley, six hitches in Uncle Sam's navy and here I get shanghaied, huh?
Imagine what they'll say at Pearl.
Yeah, when this news gets to Diego, that'll be a little bit funny, I'll bet.
Yeah. Well, good thing I got a sense of humour, huh?
Permission to leave the ship.
Man overboard!
Hey, I'll bring you before the mast!
I'll throw you in the brig, you little mutineer!
Daddy!
Hi, Dad!
Dad!
- Hi, Pops! I caught a fish.
- Hi, Dad! Me, too.
- Sit down in the boat.
- Ho, ho.
Sister Angélique,
Sister Mary Margaret.
- Doc.
- Sailor.
Sister Angélique, would you accept some nice fish from a sinner?
- Was that good or bad?
- Very good, Michael.
Thank you.
Get back in that boat, you little pirate.
Ready to take off, Doc?
- A few calls first.
- How long will you be gone?
A week, maybe two. Never know what'll happen on the outer islands.
Look in on the kids occasionally.
Don't I always?
All right, Sam. Shove off.

Transfer.
My dear cousin,
Once again I appeal to you to be rescued from this wretched island.
If you could see me living under the most primitive conditions.
The food is deplorable.
The heat unbearable, and the plumbing...
...huh, the plumbing defies description.
How can one bathe when there's no hot water?
Let's see, where was I?
Hot water, sir.
In conclusion, my dear cousin,
I respectfully request transfer to...
- Miami Beach?
- Splendid! Miami Beach.
Or possibly Hollywood, California.
Signed, Marquis
André de Lage, Baron de Fienna,
Officier de la Légion d'Honneur,
Chevalier de Marche, so forth and so on.
Here we go.
- Uncle Andy!
- Mahalo Sam.
- Hi, Uncle Andy!
- Hi, Uncle Andy!
Hello, André.
How's the coffee holding out?
Right over there, help yourself.
- How was the fishing?
- I caught one...
- Luki!
- ...that big.
And to you, my dear Guns, a very, very happy birthday.
- Birthday?
- You spoiled our surprise.
- And I baked a cake!
- With 100 candles.
- With 150!
- Oh, thanks, thanks.
Birthday! It's a real surprise.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll have a nice quiet party tonight and a big batch of lemon...
...ade.
- Gilhooley?
- Gilhooley.
Uncle Guns, please don't fight.
Don't spoil our party.
- You stay out of this.
- Go on, knock his block off!
I'll knock both of your blocks off.
Come on, you're going home.
Goodbye, Uncle Andy. Thanks.
Gilhooley! Gilhooley!
Come on, girls! Come on!
Aloha!
Oh, you lovely, lovely ladies!
Ah, the police. Well, if it ain't my old pal Beau Geste.
- Your passport, Gilhooley.
- Naturally, and two bucks landing fee?
Hi, Padre. How's the roof on the chapel holding up?
Gilhooley!
His first word and I am disarmed.
I have come to demand your deportation, and you ask about the roof.
Why not? I paid for it, didn't I?
He gave the dough away, as usual.
And the chapel still leaks, as usual.
Even more, as usual.
But what could I do?
The hurricane had swept Rorangi.
There was great need.
But what is a roof against starvation?
Stop! Stop it!
Allez!
To the chapel with me.
Now, wait, Padre. You wouldn't want me to catch a cold in a leaky chapel.
- Uncle Guns, you promised.
- Everything'll be all right, I swear.
Take the kids and practise the piano.
Get a good thick frosting on that cake.
Luki! Sally!
Donovan!
Guns!
- Where is he?
- Gone fishing.
- Hey, you got a new mirror!
- I figured it up once.
Counting all the broken mirrors, you and Donovan got 63 years of bad luck.
Hey, that's mine.
It's busted.
That's still busted.
Come on.
- Where's Donovan keep his clothes?
- Same place.
Why not? The lug owes me one.
It's my birthday.
Pick out a nice black one.
One you could be buried in.
Tommy!
Fleur! Oh, baby!
Gangway, gangway. Come on.
Yeah, I know, Gilhooley.
Tommy, you've come back to marry me.
You're the love of my life, the only dame that meant anything to me, but I already said...
...I got a wife in Hoboken.
And San Pedro and San Diego and Norfolk, Virginia.
- You want me on a bigamy charge?
- Pardon me, Fleur.
Gilhooley, no trouble.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday. My suit!
You want me to look like a bum?
I'm your guest.
22 years, huh, Boats? Great.
Pals, huh?
No fights.
Now, Guns, no fights?
22 years. Tradition. Legion.
- Legend.
- And the crowd?
Hey, Monk... Why don't you throw that guy in the brig, in the hoosegow?
- I'm off duty.
- You're always off duty!
- Not the brandy, you dope!
- Sorry.
Watch his left, Tiger, watch his left!
Oh, no!
- Tommy!
- Oh, shut up!
They went that way.
Doctor!
Come on, knock it off, you two.
As you were.
You're worse than a couple of kids. As you were. You're at attention, Gilhooley.
Now, what started this?
Being born on the same day?
Permission to speak.
What started it was he pushed a hootchy-kootchy dancer off on me in Panama.
Gilhooley!
Well, what's wrong with that?
Nothing, except a marriage licence and a wedding ring went with it.
- Maybelle.
- What?
Pearl Harbor, sir. Dame named
Maybelle. M-A-Y-B-E-L-L-E.
- I never knew any Maybelle.
- Right, her name wasn't Maybelle.
That's enough!
It's obvious neither of you remembers what started this ridiculous annual birthday brawl.
- It'll come to me, sir.
- I'm sure. Get out of there!
- Cindy Lou?
- Betty.
Oh, sugar pie!
Here we are, the three of us, on one of the most beautiful islands on Earth.
It's the birthday of two men
I'm proud to call my friends.
We've been through war together.
Bad and bloody days.
Now let's put an end to this fight.
Fleur, break out the beers.
All right, now shake hands.
Yeah, the Doc's a great guy.
Happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday!
- Tommy!
- Happy birthday to you both.
Continue.
When there's dirt to be done, you hire me.
If it's some simple honest matter, you hire Pennyfeather,
Pennyfeather and Pennyfeather.
The fact of the matter is, with the death of your great-aunt Priscilla, this fellow out in the South Seas,
Doctor William Dedham, your father, Miss Dedham...
I have never met my father. His name is not mentioned in the family.
Be that as it may, unless you can keep him from inheriting this additional stock, you'll find yourself mentioning his name, and quite often,
'cause he'll be the big he-bull in your shipping company.
I hope you ladies don't find my language too colourful.
There's a clause in the will, it's in many of these Boston wills, although civilised people don't put such drivel in wills any more.
It says if anyone can prove that the heir is not of good moral character, according to Boston standards, he may be deprived of his inheritance.
Now, if this Doctor Dedham has been living on some South Sea island with those native girls, the man has probably behaved in a way that wouldn't suit Boston.
If you can prove that, you can cheat him out of his stock and his money.
Anyone object to me using the word "cheat"?
We are waiting.
That is all.
You'll have my bill in the morning.
- Bon voyage, Miss Dedham.
- Comments?
- Great-uncle Sedley?
- No comment. With reservations.
Be pleased to take over.
Gentlemen, you may go in now.
"Miss Amelia Dedham, daughter of Doctor Dedham, is arriving ETA..."
- Estimated time of arrival.
- Thank you.
"...ETA 14.00.
Signed Captain Martin, ship Araner."
There it is, gentlemen.
This is for you, the citizens of the
US, to decide. It is not my pigeon.
The question is, does this Miss
Dedham know about her father?
You mean the kids?
- Let her find out.
- So you agree she doesn't?
I can't see
Doc Dedham hiding them like they were something to be ashamed of.
I don't know.
If I was in the Doc's shoes...
This dame's from Boston, remember?
Meeting a father she's never seen, and being confronted by three children.
- His children by some native woman.
- We know who she was!
My dear Michael, of course, Manulani.
We all loved her.
But how can this girl help reaching all the wrong conclusions?
I got an idea. You know how I am with broads. So I invite her up here.
- Then what?
- I slip her a Mickey.
I have the solution!
Gentlemen, I shall explain on the way.
- On the way where?
- To the house of Doctor Dedham.
Well, you know these wily Chinese.
- Well, you're a big...!
- Shipmate!
Polonaise!
- Hi, Uncle Guns.
- Hi, Uncle Guns.
- Hi. Padre.
- Michel.
Sounds great, Lelani.
- I'd like to talk to you.
- Sure.
Two and two is four, four and four is eight. Keep it up!
So you and the kids must move in with me and pretend you're mine.
But, Uncle Guns, I don't understand.
First you tell me
I have a sister coming from America.
- Then you say we're to leave home.
- Only until your father returns.
But wouldn't it be proper for me and my brother and sister to welcome her here in the absence of my father?
The child is right.
What you propose is monstrous.
I hate this as much as you do, Padre.
But I'd cut my right arm off for Doc.
You know when we was clobbering
Nips in that delaying action?
It's the same, only this time we're fighting for the Doc.
We're trying to buy time, so he can tell her in his own way.
I understand.
- It's because I'm not white!
- Lelani! Lelani!
It's going to be all right.
Don't worry, just...
...just trust me here.
It's going to be all right.
Let go of your starboard anchor.
Come on, look lively, blast your eyes!
Step to it!
Ahoy, Mike!
Back water.
I don't see your father here,
Miss Dedham.
He's not expecting me.
He doesn't know I'm coming.
I'm sorry. I took the liberty of sending him a radio.
Thank you very much, Captain.
Excuse me, miss.
Skipper, hi! Have you a Miss Amelia
Dedham from Boston aboard?
Aloha. Name is Donovan.
Welcome to Haleakaloha.
Your father is out in the low islands.
- We'll see you ashore.
- Thank you, Mr. McDonough.
The name is Donovan.
- You'll have to take it careful...
- I am quite capable of leaving a ship.
Ease your duff onto that rail, now.
Ah... Sit on the rail and swing your legs outboard.
Limbs.
Now take it easy, miss.
All right, Sam, watch these swells.
Watch it, Sam.
A little more starboard. Easy now.
All right, Sam. All right.
Give me your hand.
Hard to port.
Take your...!
Of all the stupid...!
- I don't need your help.
- This is no place to argue. Get in.
Of all the stupid, imbecilic oafs!
I read you loud and clear!
Thank you, Mr. Whatever-your-name-is.
Please take me ashore.
- Oh, my bag!
- Kioki!
Thank you.
Will you please take me ashore?
All right, Sam. Head for the beach.
Mr. Eu, I do not believe this is the proper time to meet the very wealthy and marriageable Miss Dedham.
- Get in.
- Hey, the dame's all wet.
And so are you.
This gentleman is from Massachusetts, also.
- One of the Gilhooleys from Fall River.
- Fascinating.
Ain't I met you some place before?
Pango-Pango?
Hong Kong, huh?
I have not had the pleasure of meeting you in Pango-Pango,
Hong Kong, nor Fall River.
Please drive on.
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
How much did you say she was worth according to Dun and Bradstreet?
$18 million.
18? Well, always my lucky number.
Wait here.
Show legs, please?
Very pretty. Very pretty.
- You've got a nerve!
- Wear this until you're dry.
Then here's a dress.
- No, thanks.
- No sale.
Please take me to a hotel.
You'll sleep at your father's place, or on the beach.
My father lives here?
Sure. Any complaints?
- What is that building?
- It's your father's hospital.
He built it... if you're interested.
Miss Dedham, this is Yoshi and Koshi.
You'd better get out of those wet clothes. Give her a hot bath.
I'm quite capable of giving instructions to servants.
I'm quite sure you are. I'll go down to the beach and get your bag.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Hey, there!
Whoa, son!
Looks like we'll have to face the music.
Sorry we woke you up.
I know this will sound fishy, but the kid forgot his Stan Musial cap.
- His what?
- My cap, that Stan the Man sent me.
- He said he couldn't sleep without it.
- Hi.
- Hi, Luki.
- Hello, Luki.
Hi, Koshi. Hi, Yoshi.
I bet you've never seen me up this late.
Pipe down.
Is this child your son?
Oh... Yeah. He's... This is Luke.
Everyone calls me Luki.
And I have two sisters.
I bet they don't even know I'm out, huh,
Uncle Guns? I mean, Papa Guns?
- What about your mother?
- Mother?
- She's dead.
- Oh, God, I wish I was in my own bed.
It's high time you were in bed.
- It's really none of my business, Mr.
- Donovan.
You should be ashamed, taking a child out in a storm.
Taking him out? I've been chasing him all over the island.
Would you like to sleep here?
In a real bed instead of the hard old cot he makes me sleep on?
Why should you complain? I'm sleeping in a hammock. I ought to belt you.
Really, Mr. Donovan, must you bully everyone?
- Take him up to the big room.
- Sleep tight, Uncle Guns.
I intend to. Good and tight.
Mr. Donovan, why don't you go home?
Or go to that saloon of yours?
If you're a typical father,
I realise how grateful I am never to have seen my own. Goodnight.
Mademoiselle Dedham.
Why are you here?
I slept here last night and I can come back any time I want, right, Amelia?
- Right.
- May I present myself?
Marquis de Lage, governor of this island paradise,
- which finds in you its fairest flower.
- Hot dog!
- Well...
- I intended to greet you yesterday.
But, alas, the duties of office!
But here I am, such as I am.
I place myself and my automobile, and you will observe, it's an American automobile, 1944, complete with driver, at your service. Mr. Eu.
- Amherst, '52.
- Mr. Eu.
If I may venture a suggestion, a scenic drive, a chilled aperitif?
- I have a picnic basket...
- That's very kind, Your Excellency.
But I promised to take Luki home.
Knock it off, Uncle Andy.
Quit horning in on my date.
Luki, your manners, remember?
Perhaps Your Excellency would be so kind as to drive us to Luki's father's.
The history of my life.
To reach towards the rose, only to be pierced by its thorn.
18 million bucks.
- Morning, Padre.
- Morning, Michel.
- Good morning, Padre.
- Captain.
That was a marvellous sermon this morning, Father.
La boîte à jukes...
The juke's box, there is no music?
It think it's busted, Father.
I don't understand.
Les Chinois, they...
I don't know anything about those things. I think it's busted.
Busted? No music?
C'est trop drôle.
- Let's have another date sometime.
- Sure, but right now you get to school.
Ah, piano lessons!
Sorry, miss, but Mr. Donovan don't allow no ladies in.
Oh, really? That's all right, Sergeant.
I promise I won't start any rhubarbs.
Now hear this, now hear this.
Mayday. I repeat. Mayday.
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.
My apologies, Mr. Donovan.
Really, no women?
- You're very welcome, Miss Dedham.
- Actually, I came here on business.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.
I'd like to charter the Araner for however long it takes to find my father, and take me back to Honolulu.
- As to that...
- The Araner is not for charter.
She has too much draught for the low islands. Reefs and coral heads.
Thank you, Mr. Donovan.
I was speaking to the sailing master.
- Captain...
- I own the Araner.
And the Inishmore, the Inishfree and several others.
You might say that we are rivals, competitors in the shipping business.
- Cigarette?
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.
- You smoke?
- Yes, I smoke.
- Well, then, perhaps...
Rain check?
Mr. Donovan,
I was quite rude last night.
Please accept my humble apologies.
I also was rather abrupt. Pax?
Pax.
- I was tired and frightened and...
- And wet?
Very wet. And to come halfway around the world only to be told...
I wouldn't worry about your father,
Miss Dedham. He'll be back shortly.
He wouldn't want to miss Christmas with his patients in the hospital.
On the house, huh?
How was my boy Luki?
How did he behave?
He was charming.
And entertaining...
Oh, and very educational.
I learned all about Mr. Musial's batting average, runs batted in, then he fell asleep in my arms.
- As Shakespeare said...
- Quite.
Dérangé, out of order and so forth.
Explanation?
Slot machine. Shipped in here six years ago. Busted. It is still busted.
But why?
I do not attempt to explore the depths of the oriental mind.
Perhaps your Ivy League chaperone could explain to my clients again that it is busted.
That's reasonable. Mr. Eu.
I will try to explain it to them in their barbarian tongue.
Carriage trade.
Lunch. Kids. My children.
Chopin.
Mozart, perhaps?
Oh, Joe College?
Two years. Football. Broken ankle.
Navy.
Miss Dedham,
I'd like to have you meet the family.
Thank you.
Of course, you may find
Father Cluzeot somewhat of a bully.
- Hi, Amelia.
- Father Cluzeot, meet Miss Dedham.
- How do you do?
- Enchanté.
- This is my oldest girl, Lelani.
- Lelani.
- You play beautifully.
- Thank you.
- This is my other girl.
- Well, you're a little doll.
- What's your name?
- Sarah, but they call me Sally.
Sarah? My name's Amelia, but nobody ever called me Sally.
No?
- Father, it's Wednesday. Water-skiing.
- No.
- You promised Lelani.
- One hour.
- May I come?
- Water-skiing is a very dangerous sport, particularly in these waters.
I don't think...
Perhaps you could teach me.
Please let her come along.
OK.
No. Lesson is lesson.
After the lesson. One hour.
Hit it!
Stop it, you monster!
I would like a bathing costume.
- Bikini, bikini. Number one bikini.
- Very pretty.
- Bikini!
- I think that's a little little.
Old-fashioned one.
- Pretty.
- Very.
- Good morning, Miss...
- Lafleur.
What a beautiful gown.
Are you contemplating matrimony?
What young girl of my age doesn't contemplate matrimony?
How true.
Miss Dedham. Very proper.
Very pretty.
And pants.
- Yes.
- A looking glass?
Thank you.
Thank you, but I don't think this is quite...
Baby, right up your alley.
You know, I believe you're right.
- Holy Moses!
- Amelia Dedham.
- Ravissante, Amelia.
- Thank you, André.
- Let's go, Miss Bunker Hill.
- Breed's Hill.
Right, let's go.
By the way, have you dispatched that application for transfer yet?
Miami Beach?
- Yes, sir.
- Cancel it.
Well, she made it.
Faster!
Let's go.
Faster! Faster!
Faster, huh? We'll give her something to write home to Boston about.
Oh, no!
No, Uncle Guns, no!
Gee, Miss Dedham, I'm sorry.
Oh, that's quite all right, Mr. Donovan.
- Fun?
- Funny.
- You mad?
- Mad?
The Araner's shoving off tomorrow morning, so I'll have to check her out.
- Take the boat. I'm going to swim in.
- I'll race you.
- You'll race me?
- Yes.
Let's go.
Ready?
Let's... Let's go.
One for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, four to go!
Go, Amelia! Go! Go, go, go!
Go, Amelia! Go!
You're out of condition, Mr. Donovan.
Match.
Oh, gee. I'm sorry, Mr. Donovan.
That's quite all right, Miss Dedham.
- Pax?
- Pax.
- That's a pretty one.
- Last year we had it bigger.
- Let's tie it on.
- Let me help.
No. Stan the Man and I can get it, can't we, Stan?
Tie it off. No more grannies, now.
Why, Lelani, that was lovely.
What do the words mean?
I was thanking the goddess of the canyon for our tree.
Goddess? Do you believe in gods and goddesses?
I believe in the one God, as we all do, but I respect the beliefs and customs of my people.
- Uncle Guns!
- I tell you, it is a granny!
The monument.
"Princess Manulani.
"Commander William...
"...Dedham.
"Michael Patrick Donovan.
"Thomas Aloy-sius Gilhooley..."
Thomas Aloysius Gilhooley.
Does this mean there was fighting on this island?
Those gold stars don't stand for good behaviour.
- Tell me.
- Not much to tell.
We got blown off our can, that's a destroyer, and ended up on the island.
There was a big Jap base down there.
So we hid out here in the hills, down in those caves.
Tossed a few monkey wrenches into their machinery.
Threw 'em a few spitballs.
It's hard to believe war has been within 1,000 miles of a place as peaceful as this.
Frangipani and flame-throwers don't seem to go together, but that's the way it was.
- We better get back down the hill.
- But...
- Who was the princess?
- We'd better go. It's a long drive.
All right, kids. Into the jeep.
- Up we go.
- OK?
How is this thing? On here solid?
You are late. Nobody listens to me.
We had to get a tree. What would
Christmas be without a tree?
- It's a long way up that valley.
- I've an idea.
Would you like to spend
Christmas at my house?
You mean that would be better than putting a tree up in a saloon?
No. Naturally, you want to spend
Christmas with your father.
Thank you. It would be very nice to spend Christmas at your father's house.
Well, that settles that.
Father, not that way, that's a saloon. The gate.
Michael, who was Manulani?
She was the granddaughter of the last hereditary prince of these islands.
- What happened to her?
- She died in childbirth.
I'm going to California
When I come back, we'll be married
What do you want me to bring you?
And this is what she said...
A hat with a crooked crown
Silver buckles for my shoes
A boa with feathers
A scalloped petticoat
And a short, tight dress
Well?
I have the pleasure to inform Your Excellency that your worst fears have been realised.
- I knew he was up to something.
- Indubitably. In a canoe.
Canoe?
A canoe?
But I have a plan.
- Bravo!
- Are you trying to crab my act?
My apologies, mademoiselle. Boy!
A drink for mademoiselle. Champagne.
No, no, no. My voice.
A slug of gin, if you please.
- Your work permit has expired.
- And your tourist permit.
But we have a plan of Mr. Donovan's house. Here is his bathroom.
You're telling me.
Come on, Sally.
- Oh, those children.
- Yeah, it's the same thing every night.
You know, Michael Donovan, you're quite a fella.
Well, you know,
Amelia Dedham, you're quite a gal.
Cigarette?
- What's the matter?
- I thought you were going to kiss me.
- What?
- Well, I have been kissed before.
Well, I...
I thought I'd been kissed before.
- I wonder if those kids are really asleep.
- I'll sit this one out.
- I'll walk you home.
- No, I'll walk this off.
Goodnight, Michael.
Oh, the monkeys had no tails
In Zamboanga
Oh, the monkeys had no tails...
Have you a light, Michael?
It's a gag, Mike. That Chinaman, that Mr. Eu. It's all a gag!
You idiot. A hammock.
SOS. Go!
Let's have it.
"Doc. Mayday.
Your Boston daughter here."
- Dotter. D-O-T-T-E-R.
- That's right, two T's.
"Insert name of"?
Her name's Amelia, you dope.
How would I know?
I ain't shacking up with her.
"Boston daughter Amelia here.
"Your kids living at my house.
Supposed to be mine.
"Mayday, Doc.
Watch your step. Guns."
He's reading.
His kids?
Doctor Dedham, I presume.
Amelia.
Father.
- Oh, Doctor-san.
- Yoshi, Koshi.
- Bath's ready, Doctor.
- How'd it go?
Fine. I'm no brain surgeon, but she'll be all right.
I'm glad.
- Do you like it?
- Very much.
I invited some children over for Christmas.
Three of the sweetest kids in the world.
Little half-castes.
- Mr. Donovan's. You know them.
- Yes, I know them.
Look. The generator's working.
- Do you mind?
- No. No, not at all.
I'll go shave and get cleaned up, huh?
- I'll have tea ready.
- Good.
Thank you, Yoshi.
Thank you.
- No cream.
- It isn't cream.
- Rum?
- Shh.
Aunt Sarah and Grand-uncle Sedley might hear.
That's right. I'd forgotten.
"The Dedhams have never traded in rum.
"We refer to it as West Indies goods."
To Aunt Sarah, Grand-uncle Sedley and West Indies goods.
- Skol.
- Slainte.
Since when have you been acquiring Irish?
Oh, Guns Donovan.
How do you know it isn't Mr. Gilhooley?
Gilhooley?
No. I'd just like you to know that
I've signed all my shares over to you.
- No, I'd rather you kept them.
- Why?
Perhaps admiration for my father?
Thanks.
I couldn't care less about the Dedham Shipping Company.
The very mention of it gives me cold chills. That's true of Boston, too.
I remember how happy I was to become the father of a fine baby girl.
That was early in the war.
The months went on. The years.
The letters got fewer and fewer.
Then none at all.
- You knew that Mother was...
- I didn't. And no one bothered to write.
Then we were torpedoed.
A lot of the men were killed.
A few of us managed to get to a raft.
Ten days later, we got here.
The sensible thing would've been to surrender.
But the people hid us, fed us, nursed us, and some even died for us.
We owed them something for that.
They didn't have a doctor on the island, and God knows they needed one.
I didn't know about your mother until five months afterwards.
When I was discharged at Pearl Harbor
I couldn't bring myself to go back to Boston.
I wasn't needed there.
But I was desperately needed here.
I know I failed in my responsibility to you.
But there were children here, too.
Children I'd brought into the world, who might die if I wasn't around.
- I understand all that, but...
- Why couldn't I have gone back?
- Even for a visit?
- There must've been other doctors.
That's very true.
But, you see, by that time I...
Isn't that sweet?
They're bringing you flowers.
That's "welcome".
Of course, you know that.
Why did they do that? Why don't they come on up? I'll go get them.
Amelia.
Yes.
Well, "'The time has come,' the Walrus said, 'to speak of many things... '
- "'Of sailing ships and sealing wax... '
- 'And cabbages and kings.'"
I've been here about...
Well, horse and buggy time. Good old
Doc Dedham. Excuse me, dear.
- It's an emergency.
- I understood. May I help?
All right. Come on.
Help me scrub up.
Mes chers enfants, bon et joyeux Noël.
Merry Christmas.
My children, once again we've come to that holy time of the year.
Time for giving, for loving and for remembering.
Tonight we have much to be grateful for.
All of us. And I perhaps most of all.
Because our chapel has, at long last, an organ.
A magnificent organ.
A gift of Miss Amelia Dedham.
Mademoiselle, I weep for joy.
Forgive me.
A gift of $150 for the repair of the chapel roof, donated by Messrs Donovan and Gilhooley...
...has been crossed out.
The poor are still with us.
Before we proceed with the pageant that Mother Gabrielle has prepared,
I'd like to say that the Royal Australian
Navy has again sent a corvette to do honour to the hereditary princess of our island paradise.
I would like to thank our brave and noble allies in the name of the Republic of France.
We thank the Governor.
"And thus it came to pass that the child was born in the city of David,
"called Bethlehem.
"And, behold, a star appeared in the heavens."
Hi, Amelia.
- Horse and buggy?
- See Amelia gets home.
Affirmative.
"And then from the East came three wise men,
"three kings bearing gifts,
"to gaze upon the child and to kneel before him in adoration.
"The King of...
"...Polynesia.
"The Emperor of China.
"The King of...
"The King of the United States of America."
Steady on, lads. Steady. Sing out.
- Bonjour. Bon Noël.
- Father Cluzeot.
- I want the truth.
- Ah, the truth!
Who doesn't seek the truth?
All of us. All men. Everywhere.
You know what truth I mean.
The Navy Cross, three Purple Hearts...
No, no, no.
Not there.
Here. Where it is enquired situation de famille. Observe what he writes.
Célibataire.
Célibataire. A bachelor.
Donovan is unmarried.
Well, there is our Mike Donovan.
Three children and not one marriage.
He's not the first man to put the cart before the horse, but three carts and no horse?
Unforgivable.
When I think how he has deceived you!
Playing upon your sympathies, pretending to be a fine father,
I could tear my beard out by the roots.
- And it's such a beautiful beard.
- Yes, isn't it?
You'd be amazed if I told you how many wom... Well, that's not important.
Tell me, chère Amélie, hasn't this revelation changed your...
...your affections towards Donovan?
Indeed it has. And for reasons you would never suspect.
The place is out of bounds.
Quiet now. You're all going to the garden parties.
- What about the beer?
- There's lashings of drinks.
- Orangeade, lemonade...
- Papaya-ade.
- Iced tea.
- Iced tea!
Now, shove off, like the nice little gentlemen you are. Go on, now.
Hey, look!
Oh, no, no, no!
- Let's have some service.
- How about some beer?
- Get a move on.
- How about some bottles of beer?
Come on, let's have some beer.
All right, the joint's closed.
Why don't you Limeys shove off?
Limeys?
I distinctly heard him say that.
Limeys.
"Limeys," he said.
I beg your pardon, did I understand you to say "Limeys"?
- I heard him.
- Gilhooley, where's my suit?
- Stay out of this. You might get hurt.
- You looking for trouble?
Tipperary born and bred. Limeys?
You're not going to allow three against one, even if it is Gilhooley?
I've seen it done.
- Three against two.
- Me?
It's the holidays.
Christmas. Have a drink.
- I will, then.
- On the house.
Look, we're noble allies.
Coral Seas, we were with you.
- He's got a point.
- A definite point.
- My apologies and a merry Christmas.
- Happy New Year.
Festus! My little brother.
Festus, we're having a sporting event.
Turn your hat around.
You are now a Yank.
Three against three.
Hey, Guns!
Festus! Festus!
Oh, shut up.
Gilhooley!
- Festus, you're a Yank.
- Festus! Festus!
- Let's have a beer.
- I'm sorry about the piano.
Don't worry about the piano.
- What's a piano amongst friends?
- That's a good one.
Peace on Earth and goodwill to men.
Oui, free beer! Free beer!
I told you Limeys to get out of here.
Why aren't you at the garden party, you heathen?!
Knock it off, fellas.
It's a holiday. Peace on Earth.
That'll get you a fat lip. Free beer!
Hey, quit it! What are you doing?
- Who started it?
- I did, sir. Respectfully.
- See you on the mat in the morning.
- Aye, sir.
- Carry on.
- Left turn.
Quick march.
- Gilhooley.
- Pardon me, Padre.
- Is this yours?
- Non, c'est la boîte à jukes.
Juke's box. Music. Comme ça.
Regardez. Voilà. Music.
Charming. Lisette, Joanne,
Annelle, Kalua, Nani, Lani.
I am like a fath...
I am like a father to them all.
Put your hat on, you brat!
Aw, shut up!
André, has anyone ever told you you're the biggest louse in the world?
Heredity. My family was always known as the biggest louses...
- Lice.
- Lice?
On the Loire.
Pardon. Protocol.
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Twins?
Tonsils.
Your Highness.
And a visitor to our island paradise...
Your sister Amelia.
Sally.
Amelia.
Sweet.
Well, brother of mine, what are you so unhappy about?
My pants are too tight. Look.
Thank you.
The Kennedys will be furious.
And as for the Donovans...
Oh, that man!
Mademoiselle, look. A miracle.
A new roof for the chapel.
I'm very happy for you, Father.
Miss Lafleur, merry Christmas.
- Oh, thanks.
- And this will amuse you, Mr. Gilhooley.
- And Mr. Donovan?
- He's dressing for the garden party.
- What's all the rush about?
- Mr. Donovan.
Of all the selfish, stupid, evil, poisonous people!
- Who?
- You.
- Me?
- Yes.
That's a fine how-do-you-do on Christmas Day.
How do you think those children feel, driven out of home as if their father's ashamed of them?
- You've got this twisted.
- No, I haven't.
You're the one we were worried about.
We didn't know if some old maid...
You turned your nose up at everybody and everything until I made a human being out of you.
- You? Made a human being out?
- Yes.
May I ask how?
Let go of me!
- That's how!
- Oh, you! Old maid!
- Oh, Miss Dedham.
- You're quite welcome.
Tommy, now you've got to marry me!
Sure, baby, sure, sure.
Amelia, aren't you going to say goodbye to Uncle Guns?
- Mr. Donovan? No, I am not.
- No guts, huh?
Amelia.
Not again.
Michael! Michael Donovan! I...
Did you hurt your... self?
You know
I'm leaving for home today?
So I heard.
Michael, if what you said is true, and if I marry you,
I don't want our children growing up knowing their father is a saloon-keeper.
I gave it to 'em for a wedding present.
- Pax?
- Pax.
A marriage made in heaven.
- If I were to consent to marry you...
- If?!
And if we were to have a boy, he will be called
Francis X Donovan, after my father.
He will be called Sedley Atterbury
Dedham, after my great-uncle.
- That's a hell of a name for a Donovan!
- Michael!
- We'll call him William, after my father.
- After the Doc?
- That's swell. I'll call him Bill.
- Pax?
Pax.
Amelia, you have a mean
Irish temper, but I love it.
From now on,
I wear the pants in this family.
Oh, you...!
COME DRINK WITH ME
Make way! Make way! What do you want?
Here's a letter for Master Chang.
- A letter? Wait here
Master!
- What's up?
Someone ahead has stopped us.
He has a petition, Sir
Letter: Release our leader or else!
Master wants to talk to you
Clear the way
Out of the sedan chair, please
Speak! Where is our leader?
What will the authorities do to him?
Speak!
He will be executed.
- Stop beating him!
Write an appeal to the Governor
If he releases our master we will let you go
I'm here to enforce the law.
As for the Governor, he is this area's supreme commander
He won't be intimidated by bandits.
You may do anything you like
The Governor is your father.
He won't sacrifice his son to safeguard his position
My dad will uphold the law at any cost
He won't swap hostages with thieves
Free me and surrender.
I'll overlook what you've done
Stop bragging, you'll die soon
No.3, write to his father
Tell him we're holding his son hostage for an exchange within five days
If he refuses, I'll kill his son and burn down his quarters
What if he dispatches troops?
With his son at our mercy we have nothing to fear - as long as Golden Swallow doesn't come.
- Who is this Golden Swallow?
He almost routed us last time
I'd like to meet him
Boy!
What will you have?
Tiger-bone wine
Tiger-bone wine?
Have you any?
- Sorry, we don't
White wine and two dishes then.
- Yes, sir
Tough trip, wasn't it?
- We've trailed him all the way.
- What's the big idea!
Looking for trouble? That's my order!
What's wrong with you?
What now?
Boy, where's my wine?
Coming!
Thank you, sir.
- What do you do for a living?
I work for the Governor.
- So you're an official
What official business are you on now?
- I want to speak with you
So you know me.
- You are Smiling Tiger Tsu Kan
You're quite observant
You wrote this letter, didn't you?
- Perhaps
But there are many details better discussed face-to-face
Go ahead
We have news of Master Chang.
- That's why I'm here
Well, then
Our leader is in your prison
Tell the Governor to commute his death sentence and release him
And we'll return
Master Chang right away
What if the Governor refuses?
- We'll have to kill the hostage
You'll find yourselves in even deeper trouble
Will you release our leader or not?
He committed crimes and must face justice
Remember our hostage is the Governor's own son
He is my own brother
Think it over then
What shall we do?
Damn it, kill him!
Get me a jug of wine
Catch!
You got drunk without wine
Your turn to treat me
Sure, drinks are on me
Catch it!
Let me get you a bench
Watch this
I'll handle the bill.
- I'll chip in
Return my money
Here you are
Golden Swallow. - Golden Swallow is the name. I toast you
You're a sensible man.
- No more games. Let's talk business
All right
I'm here to free Chang and arrest you
I'll ask the Governor to be lenient.
- Did you hear that?
You think you can capture us?
- So you won't cooperate
First you must meet our second in command
I will when I'm good and ready to.
- You'll go right now
My hand's caught in the door!
Open up!
Open the door!
What do you want?
Some wine.
- Come back later
I need a drink now.
- Get out!
Stay out of our way
Boy, how much do I owe?
What's going on?
- Never mind, get out!
I can't, it's raining
I'll pay this man's bill
He won't be leaving here today
May I know your name?
- Keep out of my way!
Quite a narrow escape.
- Did you hear me!
You won't get away with this!
Out of my way!
Innkeeper, give me a clean room.
I'm staying
You've paid too much, Sir.
- Buy me two horses with the change
I came here alone but won't leave alone. Find me a guide
Well, I lost the first round but the fight is not over
Smiling Tiger, go back and reconsider
I want an answer in five days
I repeat: Release our leader in five days or we'll kill the hostage
Show him no mercy!
- Shut up!
That kid thinks he's smart.
- Wait till he comes here
He'll learn the hard way
Eat something
You shouldn't keep your hostage here.
I'll be in big trouble if anything happens
Keep quiet!
- All right!
But I am in charge of this temple
All of you staying here like this...
- It's not like we broke in!
I know, I know but Abbot Liao Kung isn't here
When will he return?
He went to search for someone said he'll be back in a few days
Please don't start any trouble before he returns
If the Governor...
Stop!
It's only a junior monk
Are you all right?
Stop the bleeding, please
No use, he's been hit by a poisonous needle
Please give me the antidote
Give him the antidote
You're too ruthless!
I've already warned you to keep your disciples away
Next time it will be your blood that's spilled
No. 5
A lot can happen in one night
Take two men to the inn and bring the kid back. - Yes
Who's there?
Me
What do you want?
- I can't sleep. Let's have a drink
You're drunk! - No I'm not.
- Go away!
My roof leaks.
Mind if I spend the night here?
You! K
I'll go!
I saw how much you like to fight
Don't touch me
If you do, I'll die here
Get out then.
- I will, I will
Get out
I was just trying to be friendly
Return my things to me
Coming!
It's empty!
Retreat
This green bamboo staff - long and slender
With it I travel from North to South
Rain or Shine
I live by begging
I live by begging
A beggar is fed by all
This world is full of sin
Neither fame nor wealth tempts me
Nothing material will ever last
Nothing cheers me like wine
Oh wonderful wine, wonderful wine
Be it sherry or gin
I'm delighted all the same
The world is full of sorrow
There's a good heart - in my pot belly
I'm proud of my pot belly
Pardon me if I sing badly
All that singing and no one will even buy you a drink
I won't drink today for a change
Are there any meat buns available?
- You certainly enjoy eating
I want some, too.
- You won't get any
We simply must have meat buns
What's your order, drunkard?
- Meat with bread
Don't pay any attention to him.
Let's have corn bread and pickles
And some white wine.
- Forget the wine
You may have it on credit.
- No, not till the old debt is settled
Such a good boy
Sir
You've helped me a great deal.
I want to thank you personally
Whatever for?
- Is this enough? I think so
If you didn't warn me last night they'd have killed me
I was drunk then
Shall we have some noodles?
May I ask your name?
They call me Drunken Cat
Yeah, let's have noodles
Have you any money?
Of course
Will you buy me a drink?
- Certainly
I won't take it for nothing.
I'll sing for you in return
Don't pay me if you don't enjoy it
Sit down, please
The mountain bandits are on the rampage
They've kidnapped the Inspector-General
They pillage by day and hide at night
This message is worth some reward
Neither gold nor silver tempts me
But the bandits must be eliminated
The Governor's office is panic-stricken
A lone swallow flies over the hill
A lone swallow flies over the hill
We're famished.
- Be quiet!
Thank this young master.
- Thank you, young master
Young master, please take a seat over there
You wait, I'll order
Since you already know my problem
I'd like your advice
What are you talking about?
- Sir
This will pay off my debt.
Put the rest on account
You've really met a benefactor today.
- I sure have
There's no news of Master Chang.
I'm worried
You must know where they've hidden him
You're long winded for a young man
- I'm only asking for advice
I need some myself
A dot and a stroke
A slant and two crosses
The sun and the moon
What do they mean?
A dot and a stroke
A slant and two crosses
The sun and the moon
What do they mean?
Sign: Temple
Thank you
Miss, be extra careful inside the temple
Why? - Nothing, nothing
What's the use of praying to a clay Buddha - when a living god like me can grant your every wish?
Don't run away
You and I can have our own private banquet
We don't know each other!
Behave yourself!
Do you know me, Golden Swallow?
Good. You're the ones
I've been looking for
You were lucky last time
I lost the first round.
We'll see if you escape now
Good. You're all here
This is sacred Buddhist ground.
How dare you spill blood here!
I've got a mission to accomplish
Don't be too hard on us
Why don't we share a drink and have a nice chat
Stay out of it or you'll suffer the same fate as them
You just want to arrest those bandits.
What about your brother's life?
Who are you?
With such beautiful eyes as yours
I'm surprised you don't recognize me
You're Jade-face Tiger!
Let's have that chat
You're a devil in disguise
But if you're willing to repent return with me
With me pleading for you, the law will treat you with lenience
She overrates her charm and thinks
I can be leniently treated
I want to thank you for everything
Don't forget your brother is in my hands
Sooner or later, you'll be in my hands as well
Never! Being on the verge of death has left you confused
Are you spoiling for a fight?
Let's have it out
Out of my way!
I'll undress and fight you
Don't let her escape
She can't run too far.
Search the woods and bring her back
That way!
What are you doing out of bed?
You...
What's the matter?
Why did you try to trap me?
You're not calling me Sir?
Perhaps I deserve it
Why should I respect you?
You're a hopeless drunk
I told you so. I told you to observe more and fight less - but you insisted on showing off your martial arts
Learned your lesson now?
You know what's wrong with you?
You get mad too easily
Let me examine your wound
I don't need your help
That poisonous dart should have made her collapse
We've scoured the woods.
- Useless idiots!
Your whole gang beaten by a little girl
When word gets out you'll be laughing stocks
If I get hold of her, I'll...
Shut up!
No.5!
Go after her and don't return empty-handed
It looks bad
Miss Chang, there's no other way
I must suck the poison out
It's all right now
Drunken Cat, aren't you the lucky one!
Please make yourselves at home.
- Thanks
You're a bunch of cowards!
- Wait a minute!
We only came to see how you were
How can you think so poorly of us!
You'll have to carry her back
What are you up to? Don't talk so much!
- She hasn't recovered yet, sir.
Please let her go
Who asked you? Get out of the way!
Still here?
Take a rest inside
You must be tired of living
Why do you want to see me for?
I have some corpses for you.
- Corpses?
Special delivery
Who ordered you to bring them here?
- How about a drink? - Speak up!
It's a hot day and I pushed them for miles. - Hell!
Where did you find the bodies?
- In the woods
How did you know to deliver them here?
I knew your No.5.
- What else did you see in the woods?
I saw a girl fighting with No.5
A girl?
What else did you see?
Talk!
I was passing through the woods when I saw her fighting these men
She really let them have it and sent those guys to heaven
I was so scared
She did it herself?
She had me deliver the bodies to you.
Said you'd tip me five taels of silver.
I never thought...
Wait
Here's five taels of silver.
What else did she say?
Thanks. She said...
She said for you not to worry the poison wasn't strong
What else?
- That her name's Swallow
She also spoke of a business deal.
Told me to bring back any message you have for her
Let's go.
You can remove the corpses yourself
Drunken Cat, take me to her
She said she wouldn't meet me till tomorrow morning
Where?
- She said she'd come find me
No.3! Keep an eye on him and clear those beggars out
I still haven't eaten!
- Shut up!
Get him some food and fetch the monk for the funeral
The girl mentioned a business deal.
What's it all about?
Stick to drinking and mind your own business. - Sure, sure
Abbot Liao Kung is here, sir
Second Master wants you to greet him
Keep an eye on him. Don't let him out of your sight. - I understand
Don't move!
It's hot. Can I borrow a fan?
I said don't move!
I won't
Who's this Abbot? Who?
- Nobody you know. Don't ask
Where was No. 5 wounded?
The heart. Doesn't look like a dagger wound
Open the coffin and examine the corpses
No, she didn't kill him.
- Who did?
Did the beggar carry a bamboo pole with a gourd fixed to its top? - Yes
To think he was right under my nose the whole time!
You know him?
- He's the one I've been looking for
Why would an Abbot look for a beggar?
We had the same kung fu master
Had I known,
I wouldn't have been so rude
He didn't look like a kung fu ace
He's truly a great master
But compared to me he still has a way to go
What's his name?
- Fan Ta Pei
But because he drinks morning to night
Some call him the drunken hero
He killed all five
So he's one of us and it's all a misunderstanding? - Misunderstanding?
When our teacher died - he stole his treasured heirloom the bamboo pole - and started a new sect
The elders have ordered me to kill this treacherous infidel - and recover the pole
Where is he?
- In the rear hall
Seize him
What happened?
Where's the beggar?
He escaped
He won't get far!
Sir, you should have something to eat
You've been uneasy since you returned
Something's definitely bothering you
You've helped me so much
I won't trouble you further
You can't do it alone
Come here
Lift up that stone
No, the big one
Throw it at my head
Come on, strike me!
Do it again
Fling it higher this time
Are you all right?
My days are numbered
What did you tell Jade-face Tiger?
My classmate Liao Kung is the Abbot
Will you entreat him to save my brother?
Even though we had the same teacher we are enemies
He wanted to inherit this bamboo pole so he covertly assassinated our teacher
The next time we meet only one of us will live
How come he joined Jade-face Tiger?
Our teacher had no idea how evil he really was
The Abbot and Jade-Face Tiger are birds of a feather
Why don't we arrest him and eliminate this scourge?
His kung fu skills are unsurpassed
I doubt if I can beat him
He once did me a good turn
Ten years ago, I was a homeless orphan
He was the one who convinced our teacher to raise me
Because of this kindness
I've always tried to avoid him
I see
You need not concern with my troubles
I'll manage on my own
Miss Chang!
Wait
There's one way out
Bring the Governor's prisoner back and save your brother
I can't without permission.
My father would never agree
Fortunately, he's still unaware of what's going on here
Just escort the prisoner back.
I'll have him arrested again
If I deliver your leader will you free Master Chang?
Sir, since you're willing to help us we'll do as you say. - Good!
Where shall we make the exchange?
- At the southern slope
What time?
- Noon tomorrow
It's a deal
This green bamboo staff... long and slender
With it two travel from north to south
Rain or shine
Liao Kung!
You still recognize me. - We two were fated to meet again someday
Still a beggar after all these years?
Better an honest beggar than a devil in monk's clothing
I've worked hard to wear this robe
Dyed red with our teacher's blood
Where's his bamboo pole?
It's a sacred relic.
You'll never touch it
As the eldest disciple it should be mine
I am obliged to uphold the honor of our sect
Disciples must obey our ancient code
Anyone who discredits it must be punished no matter what his rank
Even an abbot?
Teacher swore that the day you saw the bamboo pole would be the day you die
So you mean to take my life
You must pay for teacher's death
Well, if he so ordered. what are you waiting for?
I can't forget you once saved me
Aren't you the noble one!
Enough of your idle chatter... give me the bamboo pole and I'll let you live
Otherwise, it's a fight to the finish
I saved your life and I can destroy your life
Grant me three days' grace.
- So you can run away?
I promised to escort
Master Chang home
You're on the verge of death yet still middle in others affairs
I'm asking for a favor.
Stay out of this affair
Your affairs are of no concern to me in three days we can settle our score
You can't escape, anyway.
Three days won't matter
You may go
What's the meaning of this?
You have the reputation of a man of integrity
How can you break your word?
I made a promise, there was no alternative
Please try to understand
Old beggar, I know what you're up to
We won't say anything this time
But if your paths cross again you better stay out of our way
I won't forget your benevolence.  I'll never interfere in your affairs again
Till we meet again.
Let's go
Thank you!
Protect the sedan chair
Are you all right, brother?
- Yes
Tell them if they don't stop
I'll kill you
Hold it!
Take some men and go on ahead.
I'll have a look up there.
- Good!
Let's trap them all
Go up the other side
Be careful, don't hurt the master
We searched east and west, and can't find them!
Wait here. I'll find them.
- All right
Attack!
Stop the prisoner's wagon
Let's go!
Get after them! Pursue them!
Where's the prisoner's wagon?
- It's headed for the hills
Out of the way!
Abbot, grab her!
- Run away while you can!
Right! Get out of the way!
Don't be so ruthless, young fellow.
Who are you?
Never mind, where's that beggar?
You... you're Abbot Liao Kung?
Sir, please keep out of this
I'll send you to heaven
Sir, take the men out of here
Have you thought about what I said?
- Yes, I have
You are hereby expelled from the Bamboo sect and exiled.
I promise not to seek revenge
You're the one who will be destroyed
Get out of here!
My life or death is in your hands
Do as you please
Don't try any of your tricks!
I am not beholden to you and I'll never again feel obligated to you
Let me tell you something.
Go and hide in the remotest hills
Adopt a new name and start a fresh
If I run into you again my sword will not be so sympathetic
I must leave you now
That's what you think!
Thank you, master.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Mr Romales and his friends will be out of business.
He won't be using heroin-flavoured bananas to finance revolutions.
Don't go back to your hotel, ser. They'll be watching you.
- There's a plane to Miami in an hour.
- I'll be on it, but first I have some unfinished business to attend to.
Forgive me.
Why do you always wear that thing?
I have a slight inferiority complex.
Where was I?
Shocking!
Positively shocking.
Goldfinger.
He's the man.
The man with the Midas touch.
A spider's touch.
Such a cold finger.
Beckons you.
To enter his web of sin.
But don't go in.
Golden words he will pour in your ear.
But his lies can't disguise what you fear.
For a golden girl.
Knows when he's kissed her.
It's the kiss of death.
From Mr Goldfinger.
Pretty girl.
Beware of this heart of gold.
This heart is cold.
Golden words he will pour in your ear.
But his lies can't disguise what you fear.
For a golden girl.
Knows when he's kissed her.
It's the kiss of death.
From Mr Goldfinger.
Pretty girl.
Beware of this heart of gold.
This heart is cold.
He loves only gold.
Only gold.
He loves gold.
He loves only gold.
Only gold.
He loves gold.
- How's this?
- It's nice... Very nice.
- Just here?
- No, a little lower.
I thought I'd find you in good hands.
Felix! How are you?
- Dink, meet Felix Leiter.
- Hello!
- Felix, say hello to Dink.
- Hi, Dink.
Dink, say goodbye to Felix.
Man talk.
You must be slipping, 007, letting the opposition get that close to you.
They got a lot closer to you in Jamaica.
What's on your mind? I'm on holiday.
Not any more, you're not. Signal from London.
I knew M wouldn't book me into the best hotel here out of gratitude.
He asked us to keep an eye on him for you.
Auric Goldfinger. Sounds like a French nail varnish!
He's British. But he doesn't sound like it.
Big operator, worldwide interests. All seem reputable.
Owns one of the finest US stud farms.
- What's the tie-up with Washington?
- He's clean.
And where do I find him?
That's his pigeon waiting for him now.
Goldfinger's been taking him to the cleaners every day for a week.
Morning, Mr Simmons! Ready for our little game?
Sure. When you're ten grand in the hole, you're ready for anything.
- Could I have my usual seat?
- You and your suntan!
Goldfinger's a fabulous card player.
- Same stakes?
- Let's double it.
Five dollars a point.
- Did you say five?
- My luck's gotta change some time.
OK.
I'll get back and cable M you're on the job.
- Fill me in on the rest at dinner.
- Fine. I'll call you later.
- Four.
- So soon?
How many?
Miss?
Hey, what are you...?
That's Mr Goldfinger's suite!
Yes, I know.
You're very sweet.
He just drew the king of clubs. That makes his count 59.
He's got a diamond run: Eight, nine, ten.
He's holding on to the six of spades, so I guess he thinks you want it.
That last draw was the eight of hearts.
He needs kings and queens.
- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.
Come on, come on!
That's more like it!
- What's your name?
- Jill.
- Jill who?
- Jill Masterson.
- Tell me, Jill. Why does he do it?
- He likes to win.
- Why do you do it?
- He pays me.
- Is that all he pays you for?
- And for being seen with him.
Just seen?
Just seen.
I'm so glad.
You're much too nice to be mixed up in anything like this, you know.
Now hear this, Goldfinger. Your luck has just changed.
I doubt if the Miami Beach police would take kindly to what you're doing.
Nod your head if you agree.
Nod.
Good! Now start losing, Goldfinger.
Shall we say $10,000?
No, let's be generous.
Let's make it $15,000.
May I see?
Hell, I can see this is really my day!
Gin!
Over and out.
That should keep him occupied for quite some time.
I'm beginning to like you, Mr Bond.
Call me James.
More than anyone I've met in a long time... James.
What on earth are we going to do about it?
- Yes. What?
- I'll tell you at dinner.
Where?
Well, I know the best place in town.
Station WEDS brings you the latest in world news.
Washington. At the White House today, the President said he was entirely satisfied...
That makes two of us.
- Hello.
- Leiter here.
Felix! Well, now?
What's that? Dinner?
No, look, I'm sorry.
I can't. Something big's come up.
How about breakfast?
OK Not too early.
- I'll call you around nine.
- Yes, nine o'clock will be fine.
- So long, James.
- Good night, Felix.
It's lost its chill!
- Why, you!
- There's another in the fridge.
- Who needs it?
- My dear, some things just aren't done.
Such as drinking Dom Pignon '53 above a temperature of 38?Fahrenheit.
That's as bad as listening to the Beatles without earmuffs.
Now... where is this passion juice?
Jill?
Yes, Mr Bond?
Beach 79432. Room 119.
- Hello?
- Hello, Felix.
Get over here right away.
- What's happened?
- The girl's dead.
- Dink?
- No, Masterson. Jill Masterson.
And she's covered in paint. Gold paint.
Gold?
All over?
She died of skin suffocation. It can happen to cabaret dancers.
You should leave a small bare patch at the base of the spine to allow the skin to breathe.
- Someone obviously didn't.
- And I know who.
This isn't a personal vendetta, 007.
It's an assignment like any other.
And if you can't treat it as such, coldly and objectively,
008 can replace you.
You've hardly distinguished yourself.
You were to observe Mr Goldfinger. Not borrow his girlfriend.
Instead, Goldfinger goes to Europe and it's only thanks to Leiter and my diplomatic intervention that you're not being held by the Miami Beach police!
Sir, I am aware of my shortcomings.
But I'm prepared to continue this assignment in the spirit you suggest if I knew what it was about, sir.
What do you know about gold? Not paint, bullion.
I know it when I see it.
Meet me here at seven.
Black tie.
What do you know about gold, Moneypenny?
The only gold I know about is the kind you wear.
You know, on the third finger of your left hand.
One of these days we really must look into that.
What about tonight? Come round for dinner and I'll cook you a beautiful angel cake.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure but unfortunately I do have a... business appointment.
That's the flimsiest excuse you've ever given me!
Some girls have all the luck!
- Who is she, James?
- She is me, Miss Moneypenny, and kindly omit the customary by-play with 007. He's dining with me and I don't want him to be late.
So there's hope for me yet?
Moneypenny...
Won't you ever believe me?
We here at the Bank of England are the official depository for gold bullion.
Just as Fort Knox, Kentucky, is for the United States.
We know the amounts we each hold and the amounts deposited in other banks.
We can estimate what is being held for industrial purposes.
Thus, both governments can establish the true value of the dollar and the pound.
Consequently, we are concerned with unauthorised leakages.
I take it you mean smuggling.
Yes.
Gold, gentlemen, which can be melted down and recast, is all but untraceable, which makes it, unlike diamonds, ideal for smuggling, attracting the biggest and most ingenious criminals.
- Thank you, Brunskill. That'll be all.
- Thank you, sir.
Have a little more of this... rather disappointing brandy.
- What's the matter with it?
- I'd say it was a 30-year-old Fine, indifferently blended, sir.
With an overdose of Bons Bois.
Colonel Smithers is giving the lecture, 007.
Gentlemen, Mr Goldfinger has gold bullion on deposit in Zurich, Amsterdam, Caracas and Hong Kong - worth?0 million.
- Most of it came from this country.
- Why move it?
The price of gold varies from country to country.
If you buy it here at $30 an ounce, you can sell it in, say, Pakistan at $110 and triple your money.
- If you have facilities for melting it down.
- And has he?
Apart from being a legitimate bullion dealer, Mr Goldfinger poses...
No, that's not quite fair.
Is, among his many other interests, a legitimate international jeweller.
He's legally entitled to operate modest metallurgical installations.
His British one is down in Kent.
We've failed to discover how he transfers his gold overseas.
And Lord knows we've tried.
If your department can establish that it is done illegally, the bank can take action to recover most of his holdings.
I think it's time Mr Goldfinger and I met.
Socially, of course.
I was hoping you'd say that.
It might lead to a business talk... Mr Goldfinger's kind of business.
- I'll need some sort of bait.
- I quite agree.
This is the only one we have from the Nazi hoard in Lake Toplitz.
But there are undoubtedly others.
Mr Bond can make whatever use of it he thinks fit.
Providing he returns it, of course.
It's worth 5,000.
You'll draw it from Q branch with your equipment in the morning.
Of course, sir.
- Morning, Q.
- Morning, 007.
This way, please.
My, we are busy this morning!
It's not perfected yet.
- Where's my Bentley?
- It's had its day, I'm afraid.
- But it's never let me down.
- M's orders, 007.
You'll be using this Aston Martin DB5 with modifications.
Now, pay attention, please.
Windscreen - bulletproof. As are the side and the rear windows.
Revolving number plates, naturally.
Valid all countries.
Here's a nice little transmitting device, called a homer.
You prime it by pressing that back like this. You see?
The smaller model is now standard field issue, to be fitted into the heel of your shoe.
Its larger brother is magnetic.
Right. It'll be concealed in the car you're trailing while you keep out of sight.
Reception on the dashboard here.
Audiovisual, range 150 miles.
Ingenious, and useful too.
Allow a man to stop off for a quick one en route.
It has not been perfected out of years of patient research entirely for that purpose, 007.
And incidentally we'd appreciate its return, along with your other equipment.
Intact, for once, when you return from the field.
You'd be surprised at the wear and tear that goes on out there in the field.
- Anything else?
- I won't keep you for more than an hour if you give me your undivided attention.
We've installed some interesting modifications.
You see this arm here?
Now, open the top and inside are your defence mechanism controls.
Smoke screen. Oil slick.
Rear bulletproof screen.
And left and right front-wing machine guns.
Now, this one I'm particularly keen about. You see the gear lever here?
Now, if you take the top off, you'll find a little red button.
- Whatever you do, don't touch it.
- And why not?
Because you'll release this section of the roof and engage and fire the passenger ejector seat.
Ejector seat? You're joking!
I never joke about my work, 007.
- Ready, Blacking?
- Yes, sir.
An old member has dropped by, sir. Same handicap as yours.
- I wondered if you'd rather play with him.
- Where is he?
- Mr Bond.
- Yes?
This is Mr Goldfinger.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- You can leave now. The first tee is clear.
- Fine.
- Hawker will caddy for you, Mr Bond.
- That'll be splendid.
Shall we make it a shilling a hole?
- I'll take some tees.
- Yes, of course.
You must excuse Oddjob, Mr Bond.
He's an admirable manservant but mute. He's not a very good caddy.
Golf is not yet the national game of Korea.
This meeting is not a coincidence.
What's your game, Mr Bond?
- My game?
- You didn't come here to play golf.
A 1940 smelt from the Weigenhaler foundry at Essen.
- Part of a smelt of 600.
- They vanished in 1944.
When the Nazis were on the run.
- Do you have access to more?
- Yes, from the same source.
Interesting.
- Two holes to go.
- Yes, and all square.
Then you have no objection to increasing the stakes?
- No. What do you have in mind?
- The bar of gold you have, naturally.
- It's worth 5,000.
- Oh, I'll stake the cash equivalent!
Naturally.
Strict rules of golf?
But of course.
Bad luck, you're in the rough.
What a pity. Here it is.
No, it's not. He plays a Slazenger 1.
Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger. Five minutes are almost up.
A lost ball will cost you stroke and distance.
I'm still training him as a caddy.
Successfully, too.
Slazenger No. 1.
Good.
If that's his original ball, I'm Arnold Palmer.
It isn't.
- How do you know?
- I'm standing on it.
Why, you crafty old...!
Leave it.
- The ball you found, sir?
- Yes, Slazenger 7.
Let's have a little fun with Mr Goldfinger.
Like me to mark it or knock it in?
Play it.
- This for a half.
- That's right.
One to go, that will be the clincher.
Fine.
Did you switch 'em, sir?
- Then we've got him.
- If he doesn't notice the switch.
- It's your honour, sir.
- It's all right.
Down in five.
I have to sink this to halve the game, right?
- You win, Goldfinger.
- It seems I'm too good for you!
You play a Slazenger 1, don't you?
- Yes, why?
- This is a Slazenger 7.
Here's my Penfold Hearts.
You must have played the wrong ball on the 18th fairway.
We are playing strict rules, so
I'm afraid you lose the hole and the match.
She's a beauty. Phantom III, '37, isn't she?
- You are clever and resourceful, Mr Bond.
- Thank you.
Perhaps too clever. Twice our paths have crossed. Let's leave it at that.
Didn't our first meeting convince you?
I see. You're worried about me not giving you a return game.
Both of us know perfectly well what we're talking about, Mr Bond.
But I see that it is necessary to remind you.
Oddjob!
Many people have tried to involve themselves in my affairs.
Unsuccessfully.
Remarkable. But what does the club secretary have to say?
Nothing, Mr Bond.
I own the club.
I assume you want the cheque made out to cash.
That would be perfectly satisfactory.
Goodbye, Mr Bond.
I believe this is yours.
Can I have your attention, please?
British United Air Ferries announce the final call for the departure of their VF400 flight to Geneva.
British United Air Ferries announce the departure of their VF400 flight to Geneva.
Mr Bond!
I've got you booked on the next flight to Geneva, leaving in half an hour.
- Thank you very much.
- Right, sir.
Discipline, 007.
Discipline.
Are you all right? Here, let me help you.
- You know, you're lucky to be alive.
- No thanks to you.
You should've pulled over further.
Look at them!
A double blowout. I've never seen one of these before.
- How could new tyres...?
- A defect of some kind, most likely.
I'm so glad it's the car and not you.
You don't look like a girl who should be ditched.
Never mind that. Please take me to a garage.
Certainly.
By the way, my name is Bond, Ja...
As quickly as possible.
- I'll take that.
- Yes, of course.
What's your name, by the way?
Soames. Tilly Soames.
Here for the hunting season?
I had a case just like that one.
It's for my ice skates.
Lovely sport.
- Where do you skate?
- St Moritz.
I didn't know there was ice there this time of the year.
There's a garage.
They say it'll take 24 hours to get new tyres. There's a hotel nearby.
- Jump in. I'll run you down.
- That won't be necessary.
I hate to leave you here alone.
I can take care of myself.
Yes, I'm sure you can.
Well... don't forget to write.
Smuggling is an art, Mr Ling.
And art requires...
In this case, the bodywork of my Rolls Royce is 18-carat gold.
We dismantle it here.
Reduce the gold in this special furnace, which in turn... weighing approximately two tons.
I make six trips a year to Europe in the Rolls Royce, Mr Ling.
It would be wiser to suspend your other activities.
Mr Ling, please assure your principals.
Operation Grand Slam will have my undivided attention...
Let me go! You're breaking my back!
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I want to kill him!
- Kill who?
- Goldfinger.
- Well, I want him alive.
- I want him dead! He killed my sister!
TM. Tilly Masterson.
I knew your sister Jill. I know what he did to her.
No, you don't! Let me go!
- So why did you shoot at me?
- I didn't. I was shooting at him!
Well, you're a lousy shot.
But somebody else around here isn't.
Come on.
Get in the car. I'll take care of him.
Run for that bracken when I tell you.
Now!
Good evening, 007.
My name is James Bond.
And members of your curious profession are few in number.
You have been recognised.
Let's say by one of your opposite numbers, who is also licensed to kill.
That interesting car of yours!
I, too, have a new toy, but considerably more practical.
You are looking at an industrial laser, which emits an extraordinary light, unknown in nature.
It can project a spot on the moon.
Or at closer range, cut through solid metal. I will show you.
This is gold, Mr Bond.
All my life, I've been in love with its colour, its brilliance, its divine heaviness.
I welcome any enterprise that will increase my stock, which is considerable.
I think you've made your point. Thank you for the demonstration.
Choose your next witticism carefully, Mr Bond. It may be your last.
The purpose of our two encounters is now very clear to me.
I do not intend to be distracted by another. Good night, Mr Bond.
Do you expect me to talk?
No, Mr Bond! I expect you to die!
There is nothing you can talk to me about that I don't already know.
You're forgetting one thing.
If I fail to report, 008 replaces me.
I trust he will be more successful.
He knows what I know.
You know nothing, Mr Bond.
Operation Grand Slam, for instance.
Two words you may have overheard which cannot have any significance to you or anyone in your organisation.
Can you afford to take that chance?
You are quite right, Mr Bond.
You are worth more to me alive.
Who are you?
My name is Pussy Galore.
I must be dreaming.
I thought I'd wake up dead.
Tranquilliser gun. Knockout shot.
I see.
I'm delighted to be here.
And, by the way, where is here?
35,000 feet flying southwest over Newfoundland.
That explains the humming.
That means you're in Mr Goldfinger's Lockheed JetStar, heading for Baltimore.
- And you're his guest.
- I'm honoured.
I never realised he enjoyed my company that much.
I don't suppose it'll be all fun and games.
Mei-Lei.
Can I do something for you, Mr Bond?
Just a drink. A martini, shaken not stirred.
- Won't you join me?
- Not on duty.
I'm Mr Goldfinger's personal pilot.
You are?
And just how personal is that?
I'm a damn good pilot.
Period!
Well, that's good news. By the way,
- where is our host?
- He flew on ahead.
Thank you.
Here's to Operation Grand Slam.
This should be a memorable flight.
You can turn off the charm. I'm immune.
We'll be landing in Baltimore, our port of entry into the United States, in 55 minutes.
Mei-Lei.
I would like to arrive more appropriately dressed.
Did any of my luggage survive with me?
And my attach? Case?
Black attach? Case damaged when examined. So sorry.
Apologies quite unnecessary.
Sydney, tell Mei-Lei to keep an eye on him.
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.
Do you want to play it easy... or the hard way?
And this isn't a tranquilliser.
Pussy, you know a lot more about planes than guns.
That's a Smith & Wesson. 45.
If you fire this close, the bullet will pass through me and the fuselage like a blowtorch through butter.
The cabin will depressurise and we'll be sucked into outer space together.
If that's how you want to arrive, you're welcome.
As for me, I prefer the easier way.
That's very sensible.
And there's so much going on around Mr Goldfinger,
I wouldn't dream of not accepting his... hospitality.
He'll be very glad to see you, too.
You like close shaves, don't you?
Washington, sir. On the green scrambler.
- M here.
- Leiter, sir.
It's about 007, sir. We picked up his homer signal from Friendship Airport, Baltimore, where he's just landed.
Baltimore? Nice of him to let us know.
Last we heard, he was in Switzerland.
He came in on a private jet, ex Geneva.
Registered to our old friend Auric Goldfinger.
I'm glad he's making progress. Keep an eye on him for us.
Bluegrass Field, Kentucky, is their final destination.
Don't charge in on him and spoil anything, will you?
He's evidently well on top at the moment.
- Mr Bond.
- Of course.
Any time.
Thank you.
Do mind your step, Captain.
Just keep playing it easy.
Mei-Lei, will you see everything's all right with Mr Goldfinger?
And I'll see you surprisingly soon.
- Talented chaps.
- They should be. I trained them.
Come on.
You're a woman of many parts, Pussy.
I believe the bourbon and branch water is rather splendid here in Kentucky.
Well, now that we're both off duty, perhaps...
Manners, Oddjob.
I thought you always took your hat off to a lady.
- You know, he kills little girls like you.
- Little boys, too.
- Dress rehearsal went like a dream.
- Good.
Your final briefing is tonight. That'll be all for now.
Welcome to Auric Stud, Mr Bond.
Lovely animal, isn't she?
Certainly better bred than the owner.
Show Mr Bond to his quarters, please.
Felix!
- Maybe we should just drop in on him.
- He'll shout if he needs us.
They're all here, Mr Goldfinger.
Oh, yes! Thank you, Kisch.
That guy Solo's gonna wear a hole in his shoes.
Yeah, I like this!
Gentlemen!
Goldfinger, why weren't we told New York and the West Coast were in on this?
Look who's talking!
I do not do business with Chicago.
I thought we had a private business deal to settle.
Now I find I'm attending a hoods' convention.
Goldfinger, I made a delivery. Where is my money?
- I made a delivery, too.
- You all made the deliveries we agreed.
And you owe me one million bucks.
I owe each of you a million in gold bullion.
So, pay!
Gentlemen, you can have the million today.
Or ten millions tomorrow.
Did you say ten million?
As soon as my bank opens in the morning.
Banks don't open on Sunday.
My bank will.
What's with that trick pool table?
- Cover him!
- Hey, cover those doors.
Turn those lights back on!
What are you trying to pull, Goldfinger?
There is no cause for alarm, gentlemen.
I don't like being cooped up like this. What's that map doing there?
This is my bank.
The gold depository at Fort Knox, gentlemen.
In its vaults are $15 billion.
The entire gold supply of the United States.
Knock off Fort Knox!
- Got a key or somethin'?
- Of a kind.
There are 35,000 troops stationed around there!
And who's gonna say boo to them, Goldfinger?
- What's going on here?
- What is this?
- The floor!
- What is this? A merry-go-round?
Man has climbed Mount Everest, gone to the bottom of the ocean.
He has fired rockets to the moon.
Split the atom.
Achieved miracles in every field of human endeavour... except crime!
The underworld will applaud for centuries!
- Cut the commercial!
- Get to the point!
It's pointless. The depository's impregnable.
- The joint is bombproof, electrified...
- Bear with me, please!
Fort Knox is a bank. Like any other.
Larger, better protected perhaps, but nonetheless a bank!
It can be... I think the expression is blown.
My plan is foolproof, gentlemen!
I call it Operation Grand Slam.
I have devoted 15 years of my life to it.
Every detail has been scrupulously prepared.
Every eventuality has been considered.
We'll operate on a split-second schedule.
Your organisation, Mr Midnight, brought a batch of these canisters across the Canadian border.
They contain Delta 9.
- Delta 9? What's that?
- An invisible nerve gas which disperses 15 minutes after inducing complete... unconsciousness for 24 hours.
Tomorrow at dawn, the flying circus of my personal pilot, Miss Pussy Galore, will spray it into the atmosphere.
Once the population, including the military, has been immobilised my task force, which Mr Strap and his people smuggled across the Rio Grande from Mexico, will approach Fort Knox in motorised equipment along Bullion Boulevard, which runs past the depository here and intersects with Gold Vault Road.
This fence surrounding the depository, as Mr Strap reminded us, is electrified.
It will be dynamited!
My task force will then move to the main entrance and demolish it.
How, may I ask?
You made that possible, Mr Solo. By using your influence in shipping circles to bring through customs uninspected a consignment labelled machine parts.
All that will then remain is to descend to the vaults where the bullion is stored.
- I've heard enough.
- Let him finish.
If you have no objection... I'll take my money now.
What's the matter, Solo? Too big for you to handle?
We must respect Mr Solo's decision.
Excuse me for a moment while I take care of him. Make yourselves comfortable.
Pussy!
Who taught you judo?
The gun you took.
The gun.
The gun, of course.
We must have a few fast falls together some time.
Hey, Strap! He's got the right answers.
You and me don't even have to be there. The boys can handle everything.
Hey, they closed up the fireplace!
- I don't like this!
- What's going on here?
The gas!
Such a pity you did not choose to remain with the others, Mr Solo. However...
Mr Bond, I thought you were resting in your quarters.
They are delightful. But it's much too nice to stay indoors.
I ran into Miss Galore and she suggested that we join you.
Mr Solo, Mr Bond. Another of my distinguished guests.
- Hello.
- Leaving us so soon, Mr Solo?
- He has a pressing engagement.
- Yeah. I'd like to get started, Goldfinger.
- Boy!
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.
My plane will get you to New York on time with your excess luggage.
Allow me.
My chauffeur's an excellent driver. You will be at the airport in a few minutes.
Goodbye, Mr Solo. Some other time, perhaps?
Happy landings, old boy.
I found him under the model.
Operation Grand Slam. I did enjoy your briefing.
So did I.
He's on the move.
Slow down, don't crowd him.
Are you blind or something? You missed the turn!
They've turned to the right just ahead here somewhere.
Where's this old pal of yours headed?
Ten'll get you one, it's a drink or a dame.
Dead.
- Mechanical failure, maybe?
- Unless he switched it off.
Why would he do that?
- Drive to the farm, it's all we can do.
- Right.
Your share of Operation Grand Slam will make you a very rich woman, my dear.
Why else would I be in it, Mr Goldfinger?
You'll retire to England, I suppose?
No, I've spotted a little island in the Bahamas.
I'll hang up a sign, "no trespassing", and go back to nature.
- Yes, Kisch?
- Two men in a car with binoculars.
Touts looking for racing tips.
There's another possibility, however.
Kisch, ask Mr Bond to join us.
We were right to spare Mr Bond's life in Switzerland, if those gentlemen are his friends.
Let's convince them he needs no assistance.
For their benefit, Pussy, let's make him as happy as possible.
I suggest you change into something more suitable.
Certainly.
Business before pleasure.
He wants you.
Mr Bond. Sit down, please.
Mint julep?
- Traditional, but satisfying.
- Yes, thanks.
Sour mash, but not too sweet, please.
You disappoint me, Goldfinger.
You know Operation Grand Slam simply won't work.
And incidentally Delta 9 nerve gas is fatal.
You are unusually well informed, Mr Bond.
You'll kill 60,000 people uselessly.
Ha! American motorists kill that many every two years.
Yes, well... I've worked out a few statistics of my own.
$15 billion in gold bullion weighs 10,500 tons.
60 men would take 12 days to load it onto 200 trucks.
At the most, you'll have two hours before the army, navy, air force, marines move in and make you put it back.
Who mentioned anything about removing it?
Is the julep tart enough for you?
You plan to break into the world's largest bank but not to steal anything.
Why?
Go on, Mr Bond.
Mr Ling, the Red Chinese agent at the factory?
He's a specialist in nuclear fission...
But of course! His government's given you a bomb.
I prefer to call it an atomic device.
It's small but particularly dirty.
- Cobalt and iodine?
- Precisely.
If you explode it in Fort Knox, the... entire gold supply of the United States will be radioactive for...
57 years.
58, to be exact.
I apologise, Goldfinger. It's an inspired deal.
They get what they want - economic chaos in the West.
And the value of your gold increases many times.
I conservatively estimate... ten times.
Brilliant.
But the atomic device, as you call it, is already, obviously, in this country.
Obviously.
But bringing it to Fort Knox undetected could be risky. Very risky.
On the contrary, Mr Bond. The risk is all on your side.
If the authorities should attempt to locate it, who knows where it might be exploded?
Perhaps the Polaris submarine pens at New London,
Cape Kennedy, near the White House.
But we are speculating idly. Operation Grand Slam will be successful.
You will be there to see for yourself.
Too closely for comfort, I'm afraid.
Forgive me, Mr Bond, but I must arrange to separate my gold from the late Mr Solo.
As you said, he had a pressing engagement.
Very chic, Miss Galore. Don't you agree?
Please entertain Mr Bond for me, Pussy.
I'll join you both later.
How about it, handsome?
Don't you think it's time we got to know each other socially?
The new Miss Galore.
Where do you hide your gold knuckles in this outfit?
I never carry weapons after business hours.
Yeah? So you're off duty?
I'm completely defenceless.
So am I.
That's my James!
Beautiful place Goldfinger has here.
Yes, I'm glad you're enjoying it.
Too bad it all has to end tomorrow morning.
He's quite mad, you know.
Well, now. What do we have here?
007 seems to have the situation well in hand.
Come on, I'm bushed. Let's get back to the motel.
- You're quite a girl, Pussy.
- I'm strictly the outdoor type.
I'd like to think you're not in all of this... caper.
Skip it. I'm not interested. Let's go.
What would it take for you to see things my way?
A lot more than you've got.
- How do you know?
- I don't want to know.
Isn't it customary to grant a condemned man his last request?
You've asked for this.
Get up!
Certainly.
Now let's both play.
Pussy Galore to Champagne leader.
Commence Rockabye Baby. Good luck!
Speed: 220.
Wind check: Westerly.
Champagne leader to Champagne section. Commence dive... now.
Ready for Rockabye Baby.
Commence spray on countdown.
Five, four, three, two, zero.
Champagne leader to Grand Slam task force leader.
The baby is asleep.
I repeat, the baby is asleep. We're going home now.
Out.
Good morning, Mr Bond.
For once, you are exactly where I want you.
- The bomb's here.
- Let's get moving, Brigadier.
- Right, Jack, move in.
- Move in, commando tactics.
Minimum offensive fire until I signal bomb has been neutralised.
Minimum offensive fire until I signal bomb has been neutralised.
Bomb disposal unit to accompany DOG.
Goodbye, Mr Bond.
Mr Ling, it is merely timing...
He's one of them, so is the girl.
I'll get her, you get the door open.
We're trapped!
The bomb... I'll take the fuse out.
Don't be a fool!
You can be a hero, I'm not!
No, no!
Keep going! Hurry up!
What kept you?
You OK, James? Where's your butler friend?
He blew a fuse.
Three more ticks and Mr Goldfinger would've hit the jackpot.
- Did you get him?
- Not yet, but he won't get far.
- And Pussy?
- She helped to switch the canisters.
By the way, what made her call Washington?
I must have appealed to her maternal instincts.
Come on, James. Get aboard. You can't keep the President waiting.
Special plane, lunch at the White House. How come?
The President wants to thank you personally.
- It was nothing, really.
- I know that, but he doesn't.
I suppose I'll be able to get a drink here.
I told the stewardess liquor for three.
- Who are the other two?
- There are no other two.
- Goodbye, Felix.
- So long. Good luck.
- Thank you, Brigadier.
- Good luck.
I'm glad to have you aboard, Mr Bond.
Well, congratulations on your promotion, Goldfinger.
- Are you going to the White House, too?
- In two hours I shall be in Cuba.
You have interfered with my plans for the last time, Mr Bond.
It's very dangerous to fire guns in planes. I even had to warn Pussy about it.
- By the way, where is she?
- I will deal with her later.
She is where she ought to be... at the controls.
Pussy!
- What happened? Where's Goldfinger?
- Playing his golden harp.
It's no good.
Oh, no, you don't!
This is no time to be rescued.
Draw...
...swords.
11th Hussars present and ready for your inspection, my lord.
I do not propose to recount my life in any detail what is what.
No damn business of anyone what is what.
I am Lord Cardigan. That is what.
Them Cherrybums, you see them tight,
I keep them tight.
10,000 a year out of my own pocket
I spend to clothe them.
A master cutler sharps their swords, and I keep them tight-stitched...
...cut to a shadow. Good.
If they can't fornicate, they can't fight...
...and if they don't fight hard,
I'll flog their backs raw...
...for all their fine looks.
Nolan. lt's Nolan.
There. Lewis!
Nolan!
He's seen us. l've not seen him for years, and yet it will be like yesterday. l hope l can love him as you do.
Dear friend!
-This is Clarissa?
-This is my dear Clarissa. l've landed two days.
We were handed letters at Aden.
You do scribble a lot, William.
Still, dear friend, l'm here. l am gazetted to the 11th Hussars, you know that.
My brother is to join the 11th Hussars,
Capt. Nolan. l'm playing the spy in Mufti. l've not joined yet, so l took the opportunity of a spy's eye at them.
Are they good, William?
They look good.
Cardigan has them looking good.
Yes, the mounts do look pretty dressed up.
Still...
...it is good to see you both, and here of all places. lt is good.
England is looking well.
-Fanny!
-Clarissa!
Ladies and gentlemen, l am sure you will all be very glad to join with me...
...in wishing the young couple long life...
...happiness, and all that they wish themselves.
Hear, hear.
The bride and bridegroom.
Young men of London, fall in and follow me, boys. lf you would not be starved by cruel masters...
...if you would not be ruled by anyone except the Queen, God bless her...
...but who do have the urge to seek wealth, fine clothes, and glory...
...you can do no better than to enlist...
...for the 11th Regiment of Hussars.
Culloden. Flanders. Salamanca. Waterloo.
An escort to Prince Albert on the occasion of his wedding...
...after which he called us his own.
God bless him.
Our dress is bright and warm.
Our mounts is mastered and mannered, gentle in ride and calm in battle.
Our officers just whisper.
They being of the opinion, like myself...
...that more can be done glorious by leading from the front...
...than can ever be brought off by prods up the arse from the rear.
Hold your head up, sir. l believe you would look a rare treat in stable dress.
-Are you respectable?
-l've often thought of enlisting. l thought you had, by the fine way you carry yourself. l'm a bad character, just out of jail. ln that case, you've already served Her Majesty.
Lord Cardigan's Cherrybums, follow me.
Keep yourselves clean, that's important.
You'll never want for money, and the glitter of a Hussar...
...is something l've seen the gay ladies pearling their eyes after.
Be obedient, be clean.
What is a pitfall is drink.
That will not concern me, for l do not drink.
What will concern you is, you'll never speak to an officer in that manner again.
Attention!
Scrub the scum clean.
Old Swaddy will settle you into your troop, show you the way of it.
Bossing your kit and being clean.
Right, strip off.
-What is the condition of them?
-They're all wobbly-boned.
Recruits in England are mostly wobbly and bad-formed.
There is no such thing as a wobbly officer.
What you sergeants never seem to understand...
...is the state of responsibility that an officer is in.
They worry. They hardly never wobble.
There is no place happier than a cavalry mess.
If one is a stupid, inconsiderate and lazy man...
...one can fit as a round peg into a snug round hole.
At times I am so pent up with their languor
I could grab of two of them...
...and bang their noddles together till their doodles drop off. l'm Codrington. l've come to join.
-Come to join, young fellow?
-Yes. Fond of riding are you?
-He's as green as grass.
-Or soon will be.
A fine growed-up fellow, though, with very neat feet.
Rupert.
You're a madman, sir.
And you are on your arse, sir. l'm thirsty. lt's the salt from the mutton.
-Have you got no money?
-l have none.
-ln your clothes.
-lt was....
-l did have money in my clothes.
-Did you? l'm out for a wet, a drop of beer.
Pongelow is the drink, they call it.
''How d'you think l paid her? l met her in the barracks yard...
''...and gently down l laid her.''
Private Metcalfe, for the wives.
Get back in there.
Lady Scarlett is giving a ball.
-Capt. Nolan.
-Lewis, how do you do?
Clarissa, Mrs. Morris, it is wonderful to have you back...
...you both back, it is wonderful. Come on. l danced as a boy on the eve of Waterloo.
-There was a war.
-That was a war. l don't think l belong, Duberly. l'm sure l do. Oh, l'm sure you do. l'm more a scientific poet.
-Scarlett.
-My lord.
All this swish and tit gets me sniffing nose up. l shall have to fetch it off tonight, Squire.
Had me Cherrybums out today, always makes me randified.
Duberly says he is despised by his officers and feared by his men.
Duberly says the 1 1th have become a laughing stock...
...for the shortness of their jackets and the tightness of their britches.
He says it is wicked, he commands over the heads of gifted officers...
...when he is such a blockhead.
They tell me that her pitcher has been too often to the well.
Duberly says I must stop looking at Lord Cardigan...
...as if I want to be ridden by him.
Duberly says he has left his wife...
...and is the most notorious casual person with women...
...immoral and licentious. l want to dance with Lord Cardigan more than anything else in the world. ls he not the very picture of the finest Englishman?
Has he not an exquisite head? l've just been introduced to
Squire De Burgh, charming fellow.
-l believe the next is a gallop.
-l believe it is. l don't have a programme. l don't gallop very well with ladies indoors, but may l have the honor?
-l shall be pleased.
-Excuse us.
You have a clever officer in Nolan,
Lord Cardigan.
He has written a book, which is not a diary but of a scientific nature.
-To do with soldiering.
-What, some damn novelist? l do envy soldiers' way.
What it must be to hunt one day and fight the next. ls war terrible? lt is the stuff. lt is the stuff we're all hoping for.
Soldiers do, Fanny, those that are waiting to use their talents.
What is most a talented officer should have? Courage and dash?
Some of that. A soldier should have some courage, of course.
Most of all, to know what is right.
Judgment, a feeling for decision.
A cavalry officer depends on the strike in his eye.
When and where to use it.
Comradeship. How high is that regarded in military things?
High. But true comrades are rare, like the truly loving wife is rare.
-William has talked of you constantly.
-l shall tell him to stop.
He says you are the finest horseman in England.
Does he say l'm the finest dancer? l'm not.
He goes further than that.
He says, probably in Europe, also.
He exaggerates.
William is indeed fortunate.
Are you happy to be a soldier's wife?
Should soldiers have wives, Capt. Nolan?
William should.
That's the Duke of Wellington's statue. lt was subscribed for by the whole nation, and now they don't know where to put it.
There is great concern.
-He was a fine soldier.
-So are you, l am told. l learned from a friend that you have a system. l'd like to write an article on you for the Times.
Come on, now!
That is Cardigan's system.
A shilling a man it costs him.
Can you beat that?
He reckons to train up a troop horse in less than 14 days, is his system.
-Capt. Nolan.
-And his system. l am not one of your new lights with tea and a Bible canteen. lt is not a revelation.
Both of you have plenty of it.
You, dear friend, l know, and you, Russell, l am sure. lt is, in a word, kindliness.
-How are you today, my beauty?
-She's very well, sir. Thank you, sir.
Pridmore. Dismount.
Prepare to mount. Mount.
Move like a Highgate whore, put some spring into your back.
You'll not learn nothing from watching this...
...but l should stay watching. l want you, what your name is, on the right.
Your name, on the right!
Do you not know your right?
You, on the right!
Where l'm pointing now!
You! l want you to watch this blade...
...for should it waver, slice it down fairly through my head...
...as hard as you can. Face front!
You've got no hooks on!
Sergeant, on the left.
Hooks is spurs.
-Name?
-Metcalfe.
You will wear your hooks at all times.
Sgt. Smith, what he is doing, don't look down...
...is marking you right from left.
He can read, so he knows his left from right.
What you've got there is a new foot...
...an army foot you've never had before. lt's like a foreign language to them.
They don't know any direction, back or front.
They'll never find their front when there isn't a black face to it. l always tell them, they'll know their front...
...from the many black nigger faces waving knives at them.
What we will do now is finding left.
Try it.
Try straw foot forward.
That officer....
Capt. Nolan, my lord.
Does that black savage belong to him?
Capt. Nolan has served in lndia and has an lndian servant.
That's no excuse.
Who are you, sir? l am Capt. William Morris of the 17th Lancers.
-Are you another of these damned lndians?
-He is an old-- lndia?
Don't tell me of lndia, you and your black rogue.
No use rubbing under it.
Officers who have served in lndia...
...are considered less worth than those who purchase their way...
...from one regiment to another. lt is, Nolan, at Kaffirs and savages you have put your men...
...which is something more than a round of drills.
You lndians are the only officers who led your men in war.
Listen, a linnet. lt is good to have you with us.
When you were away, you were in my thoughts every day. Wasn't he?
You were, indeed.
-You are both good friends now.
-William is very happy. l am.
We all are.
He does love you dearly.
-Are we now to become horse marines?
-We are.
''For thy smile would make a summer
''Where darkness else would be
''For thy smile could make a summer
''Where darkness else would be''
One, two, three, four.
Who gave you permission to dismount?
One, two...
...three, four.
Sahib mighty good horsemen, both Sahibs.
You're all a-bleeding-sleep! Left leg over.
Do you have a hunter for rides in the morning? l am fond of riding.
Warsham! Bring our new friend, Newboy.
Now, this is a thoroughly useful animal.
Brother!
You stupid, drunken cad.
You've nothing but a queer upbringing amongst cattle and bad practice.
-Rupert.
-All right.
Damn you, if you want to get shot off.
Gently.
Steady now.
Walk on, now.
Trot on.
Gently.
Xenephon's words should be painted on every stable end:
''Horses are not taught by harshness but by gentleness.''
For classical officers like Mogg here...
...the inscription should, of course, be in Greek.
-Mogg!
-Sir. l will not have an officer of mine shown up by an lndian wretch.
He made a monkey of you, sir.
-That man.
-Sir.
That man has not watered his horse.
Tell him to water his mount...
...straight off before the bridle is off so that he cools off. Tell him!
Tell him l shall take orders from a man, not a monkey.
''For those that wander
''They know not where
''Full of trouble and full of care
''To stay at home
''To stay at home is best''
Oh! l daresay, yes, for a soldier, some song.
You'll have to find an appointment out of reach of Lord Cardigan and his regiment.
He is a dangerous man.
He will see you broken, it's his practice.
-lt is a fine regiment.
-Yes, it is a fine regiment.
Fanny, hello. l promised to help her school her bob.
You must be aware of my regard for you.
Yes, of course. lt would be an offence between us if l denied it.
Looking everywhere.
-Clarissa, l--
-You won't go.
No, please pay me no attention. lt would hurt William if you were to leave.
Come here. l don't say it lightly or easily.
Not look.
Not hear. lt is not easy, Clarissa.
No. lt is the Lordship's command that only champagne be served in the mess tonight.
Are you cosseted, young man? l have your orders, my lord...
...to be here and eat lettuce. l am eating lettuce. l have eaten lettuce.
What it tells, my lord, is that as youngest officer...
...you will expect him to eat as a rabbit does, only lettuce. lt is signed by you, my lord.
So green, boy, you have been drawn.
Not my order, you should eat lettuce...
...though perhaps it will put some sap in your pizzle.
Does this tomfoolery make officers?
Perhaps, but it makes comrades.
Do you think we could have some Moselle,
Nolan?
-Of course. A bottle of Moselle, please.
-Thank you.
We always depend upon being seen to do our duty. l know if l'm up to something glorious in the field, l insist upon being seen.
There ain't much point, otherwise.
-What color is the Russian enemy?
-Sneaky color.
Gray. Your Russian is gray, which is why he can't be seen...
...which is why his promotion is slow.
There ain't one above a corporal in the whole lot...
...which is why we will cut 'em up.
With a little breeding, an Englishman can buy his advancement.
He and l are not able to buy our advancement.
We've had to obtain it by our abilities.
No use decanting it.
You can leave it on the table.
Thank you.
Couleur de Noir.
You are drinking beer, sir, porter beer.
-No, my lord.
-Yes.
-No.
-See it.
No, my lord.
Don't you ''no'' me. That is a black bottle. l assure you, my lord.
That is a black bottle, and you are drinking porter from it.
Champagne only. ln point of fact, l asked Capt. Nolan--
-You knew that!
-l am not aware. l am aware you are drinking porter at my table.
Sit down, Capt. Nolan.
Sit down, Featherstonehaugh.
What his Lordship said was that champagne only would be drunk...
...in the mess tonight. What he said.... lt is not porter, it is Moselle, my lord.
Apologize. lf l am in error--
Error? Don't quibble with me, sir. Beer. l will not have beer drunk in my mess.
Come back, Nolan.
Nolan, you will not leave the mess. Dog!
Devil upstart. lmpertinent lndian dog devil.
As President of the Mess Committee, what Cardigan would have me say is...
...you are guilty of disorderly behavior.
What you should consider in the future...
...is that the mess should be conducted like a gentleman's table...
...not a common ale house with black bottles.
That is an offensive thing to have to say...
...to have said, one officer to another, in front of brother officers.
Do you not know that, unlike a farmer, a gentleman decants his Moselle?
He doesn't drink it like beer. lf you cannot behave like a gentleman, you are to leave the regiment.
Will you shake hands with me, sir?
-There is no quarrel between us.
-You will. l will not, my lord.
-You flagrantly insult this officer.
-No insult is intended to this officer.
Shake hands, damn you.
You shall be arrested.
Why shall l be arrested? l shall have you arrested.
You are arrested.
Go to your quarters, sir, and be arrested.
Have you seen the Times this morning, Raglan? l have seen the Times, Airey.
''Black bottle.'' l'm very worried about the British army when it gets into the newspapers.
Whatever Lord Cardigan does is public news within an hour.
-lt is unfitting.
-''Black bottle.''
-What?
-What is shouted at him when he goes out? lt do bring the army up for snooks, you know.
Vulgar things.
Shouldn't say these vulgar things at him, Airey.
But what can we do?
Where are they going to put that statue, Airey? lt can't stay there, to be enjoyed by me alone.
They won't leave it there.
They don't know where to put it. lt's very much in my light for paperwork, Airey. l wish they'd take it away.
You and l are always of the custom, when in difficulty, to ask ourselves...
...how the great Duke would have acted and decided in similar circumstances.
We are. l am. l will.
He was surely right that when there is danger...
...it is the persons with a stake in the country, land, position, wealth...
...that are best able to able to defend it. l am an old man, Airey...
...and l've only got one arm to fight the war with. lt won't be enough.
Duberly says it's going to be war.
He says the Russians will fight...
...and the Prime Minister is faced towards peace, but carried towards war.
Duberly says l can go with the army. l can go, Duberly says, as a wife, which l am. lsn't it exciting?
-William wants to go.
-Soldiers will.
''Answer me to what l ask you.''
''Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten her nine farrow.''
''Come, high or low.
''Thyself and office deftly show!''
''He knows thy thought.
''Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
''Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
''Beware Macduff.''
Lewis is arrested over the black bottle. lt is sure. He is under arrest.
-Nolan?
-lt may be the end of his career.
-Mr. De Burgh, how do you do?
-Without you, sir.
Being under arrest, is it certainly the finish of his career as a soldier? lt is serious. lt is a serious thing for an officer.
There's Lord Cardigan.
Late for the play. Going to the war.
Black bottles!
Shall we go and boo him?
-Black bottles!
-Sit still before l hit you, girl. l'll form a picket. Come on, Henry.
Present me as a picket come to get the black bottle from the horse's mouth.
What black bottle?
My wife, Mrs. Duberly.
She's been enquiring after Capt. Nolan.
Under arrest, that man. l have placed him under arrest. lndeed, my lord. On what crime?
Failing to behave like a gentleman and turning the mess...
...into a disorderly house with black bottles.
We must go, Clarissa. l'll find out about Nolan.
Duberly never tells me anything.
Company, attention!
-Sergeant Major.
-Sir. ls he shaping? l would put him forward as a good clean man.
-Could he take the trumpet?
-That will be a good step for him.
Good. Something for you, Sergeant Major.
Carry on polishing, men.
-Sergeant Major.
-Sir. l want a report of any conversation
Capt. Nolan has with other officers.
You are to take note of whatever he might say and bring the information to me.
-l shall spy, my lord?
-You shall.
My lord....
To be asked to take up the spy.... l am much distressed to be asked such a thing, my lord.
After 20 years of coming up from private trooper...
...and keeping off the pongelow...
...not a drop since corporal. l shall inform Capt. Nolan. l can hardly do other.
Sergeant Major, it is better that you take a ball and put it in your own brain.
You are finished now, as if you had not ever been made.
What a waste.
Your duties!
Main guard present and correct, sir.
Stable guard present and correct, sir.
Number 1 squadron, present and correct, sir.
Straw foot, right foot.
Staff parade.
Ready, present for inspection, sir. ls he drunk?
-Sergeant Major.
-Yes.
This is all according to the articles of war.
I was drunk at my post.
It is not my place to criticize.
But it will have a grave effect on the noncommissioned officers...
...for it will show there is a slender thread.
One slip, and a soldier is deprived...
...of what has taken years of steady effort to obtain.
-Permission to carry on, sir.
-Farriers, do your duty.
One...
...two...
...three...
...four...
...five...
...six...
...seven...
...eight...
...nine...
...ten...
...eleven...
-Stand still and be quiet!
-...thirteen...
...fourteen....
Always one or two of your younger tyro officers brings up or flops over.
Faints away like lily at bedtime.
The time should be past when such treatment is inflicted on a British soldier.
They will not fight unless they are flogged to it.
Would you ask that of them?
Would you ask they fight like fiends of hell for money or ideas?
That would be unchristian.
...forty nine...
...fifty.
Punishment completed, sir.
Unfasten.
What will you do now, Sgt. Major? l doubt if he'll have a pension now...
...and that worries me. l shall continue in the service, though no pension.
Shall you enlist as a private in some other regiment...
...and hope to make your rank again? l shall, sir. l am too humbled to stay in the 11th. lt is humbling. l have had some humbling.
You can't avoid it.
There is no making without breaking.
-My lord, l must protest.
-Nolan, we don't flog officers.
-Am l still under arrest, my lord?
-You would prefer that you are released? l do not wish to be released from arrest. l wish for a court-martial...
...that l may state some things of how you asked my fellow officers to spy on me.
You lie, sir. lt is you who spy.
Are spying up against me.
You shirk your duties, sir. l can hardly shirk my duties if l am not under command, but arrested.
You lying scoundrel. lndian rogue.
You will not have a court-martial.
You were born dishonored and a lie, and you will die in lies.
Come back here! l have not finished with you.
Try not to hit him, Nolan.
We must remember our rank.
You blackguard, what do you whisper? l am ashamed that you are not polite to our rank. We are your own officers.
Officer? Paymaster Duberly!
That ain't a rank, it's a trade.
One day, there will be an army where troopers need not be forced to fight...
...by floggings and hard reins.
An army...
...a Christian army, that fights because it is paid well to fight...
...and fights well because its women and children are cared for...
...an army that is efficient and of a professional feather.
I must fight for such an army.
Dear friend.
That army will bring the first of the modern wars...
...and the last of the gallop.
-lt does look like war.
-Does it? l do think the French have been asking for it for some time...
...ever since they had my arm.
But it won't be the French this time, will it?
Won't it be the French? l've got a map somewhere of who it ought to be.
-Will you see Capt. Nolan, 11th Hussars?
-Yes.
Well, it might be the French, it might always be the French. l knew it would be.
Nolan, Capt. Nolan, sir.
-Have you got a map?
-My lord, may l ask--
Speak up, he's a bit deaf when he's thinking, and that statue doesn't help.
My lord.
You're the chap.
You've been shouting at Lord Cardigan.
Calling him things.
You've put the army in the newspapers.
My lord, l request the privilege of being granted a court-martial.
Perhaps they could put it over one of the new railway stations.
Court-martial? My dear Capt. Nolan.
Well, what can we do about it?
You're becoming a laughing stock, gentlemen.
You're appearing far too frequently in the newspapers. ln the case of Capt. Nolan, now...
...Lord Raglan refuses his request for a court-martial...
...that it might be prejudicial to the good of the service and cause public disquiet.
-Gen. Airey, l--
-lf you persist in this matter...
...you will forfeit the sympathy of every officer of rank in the service.
As for the conduct of Lord Cardigan...
...Lord Raglan expects that in the future his lordship will exercise the forbearance...
...and discretion befitting an officer and a gentleman.
We are being taken towards war by popular fervor.
There is no reason for war, there is no real understanding of the issues...
...because there are hardly any issues involved.
Let us not pretend that Christian England can find common ground...
...with infidel Turkey against Christian Russia.
''Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.''
Restrain yourselves, my friends. Peace.
Peace, my brethren.
Restrain yourselves, my friends.
-So excited.
-Yes.
Everybody is so excited. l'm not excited. ls it such an exciting thing to do?
Yes, it is the most exciting thing in the world.
Perhaps there is no other life for a man, is there, Lewis?
No, there is not.
How sad.
-Why sad?
-Because it all ends in death.
-l will not have you thinking of death.
-No. l don't know what has made me think of death.
War has made her think of death. l do believe it has.
Dear Clarissa, it is inevitable.
Until such savages are sufficiently civilized to understand...
...and abide by decisions arrived at by arbitration...
...we will have, we must have, war.
Yes.
Now, l feel l should propose a toast or something of the kind.
-l'm not sure what.
-Not the Crimea.
No.
Lewis, what about you?
Your new appointment.
No.
No?
The three of us.
To the three of us.
Lewis.
-l am with child.
-You are. l didn't know.
William has been longing to tell you. l am so unhappy.
No. You should both of you be happy. lt is a happy thing. l beg you not to entertain any thoughts other than....
They're there, Lewis, like unwelcome guests.
No, not unwelcome, welcome.
Please take my hand. l long for it to be yours.
My dear, l must join William. lt is some madness in you that has infected us all. l shall not be the same from knowing you, nor William either.
When you are with him, there....
Remember, my heart is....
-Lord Lucan.
-Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Don't treat me as if l was a child, sir.
Sebastopol.... Now what is it?
-Lord Lucan.
-Lord Raglan.
Good, good. We have some things.
Do l get command?
You?
Control of the Mediterranean.
That's what the Czar's at, and then afterwards lndia, and he will have war.
The Duke of Wellington always thought of you highly...
-...found you very qualified, Lucan.
-He is.
That is fact.
To do it stylish and sicken the Czar...
...we are to put Sebastopol to the flames, and that is our intention. ls there something for Scarlett to have? l think Scarlett should have something. l'll tell him he'll have something, but you don't know what.
-l do know what.
-Am l to have the army, or am l not?
Not. l have the army. l will command the expedition myself.
Of course you will. l would. lt is my earnest hope that you will consent to assume command of the cavalry.
Very well.
What is Scarlett to have, Airey?
Scarlett will have the Heavy Brigade and Lord Cardigan, the Light Brigade.
Cardigan? The Light Brigade?
That damned never-out brother-in-law of mine.
You threaten me with Cardigan? l'll not have him or his red-shanked ridgebacks under my command. l'll not command him.
Capt. Nolan's reporting, sir, though his regiment is about to sharpen...
...l have persuaded him there is duty and honor for him with us. l'm sure you will see that there is much to be gained...
...by an amicable settlement of any difference...
...between you and Lord Cardigan, for the good of your country.
Then make it known to that empty-headed muff of a brother of mine, that Brudenell...
...that l command the cavalry, and l command him.
Tell the fool, in simple manner that he'll understand, he is under my command.
Of course.
-You've got Sebastopol.
-l don't want any damned Sebastopol.
-But l was shown it on the map.
-l told you. No damned Sebastopol.
Sir Colin Campbell, Highland Brigade.
Gen. Scarlett, Heavy Brigade.
Sir Richard England, Third lnfantry division.
Sir John Burgoyne,
Superintendent Royal Engineers. l came to be offered a command.
Not serve under that fool, Lucan. l knew...
...the moment l saw his biscuit face sopping up wet around the horse guards...
...he'd be here, starting his wheedling. l'm sure that after a little while,
Lord Cardigan...
...you may be persuaded such an arrangement may be made to work.
After all, you will have the Light Brigade.
Dash and fire, eh?
Yes, Cardigan, you'll have the Light
Brigade. Dash and fire it is.
Lucan couldn't make himself fit to command a tent. Command an escort.
Not fit to command a troop of knackered tailors on stubbed donkeys.
Airey, those two, don't let them sit together.
We must do what we can to keep them apart.
Things are serious and they are silly in ways.
-My lord.
-Lord Raglan.
Sit down, gentlemen.
War. This is war, gentlemen.
Our passage to lndia is threatened, l should think. Wouldn't you?
The honor, the reputation, the glory of England is threatened...
...and the Queen's majesty is sure to be threatened, she is. lf poor, brave, weak little, sick little Turkey....
''The sick man of Europe.''
Yes, though l prefer to consider her as a young lady, hands up, flutter...
...defenseless. lf she should fall to the tyrant.... lf the Turks go down like cards, flip-flop...
...then next up our own Solent...
...and our own Queen, will come the Russians, ships and guns...
...to rip our country into shame.
The Russians. The Russians.
The Russians. The Russians.
The Russians.
Poor little Turkey.
Poor little Turkey!
Attention for Mr. Cornet Codrington, the orderly officer.
Me darlin' soldier, wait till l kiss you clean.
Are they winking at you, sir?
Permission to speak, sir.
Mrs. Mitchell, sir.
Are all the wives going, sir, or just a few? l'm strong, sir.
And so am l. l can't say. l really can't say.
One in six, sir.
One in six?
You look tremendous.
This is the beginning of a very long test, my dear William. l see you have your cattle slung aboard. l must watch for old Treasurer, that he is handled gently. l have a letter of importance for you, but orders are not to be read...
...until we up anchor. lmpressed on me, from Clarissa.
Where's Lord Cardigan?
Get into line, Lord Cardigan.
Light Brigade, with me.
What?
Trooper!
Pull those ropes faster.
Soldier!
Tomorrow, Calamita Bay. ls it aptly named, do you think, William? l know you worry about my rheumatism. lt is gone, almost gone.
-l wish l could come with you.
-We're going to swim and things.
But Henry, l can swim.
When we're settled, l'll see that you're rowed ashore.
Dear husband, kiss.
Dear wife, kiss.
{5613}{5705}They come closer every day, Pa.
{5708}{5813}- They on our land?|- No, sir.
{5815}{5903}Well, then, it doesn't concern us.
{6008}{6070}Does it?
{6198}{6269}You have something else to say?
{6295}{6358}No, sir.
{8228}{8300}Lord, we...
{8646}{8750}- What'd I do?|- Well, it's what you haven't done, Boy.
{8753}{8858}A man that eats with his hat|on is going nowhere in a hurry.
{8860}{8968}Now, your mother wanted all of|you raised as good Christians,
{8970}{9083}and I might not be able to do that|thorny job as well as she could,
{9085}{9195}but I can do a little something|about your manners. Now, shall we...?
{9215}{9308}Lord, we cleared this land.
{9310}{9429}We ploughed it, sowed it and|harvested. We cooked the harvest.
{9431}{9551}It wouldn't be here, we couldn't eat|it, if we hadn't done it all ourselves.
{9554}{9646}We worked dog-bone|hard for every crumb,
{9649}{9789}but we thank you just the|same, Lord, for this food. Amen.
{10021}{10143}- Where'd you come by the hat, Boy?|- Down by the creek, sir.
{10145}{10275}- Some fella down there passing out hats?|- I found it. It was just lying there.
{10330}{10424}Jacob, you look like you|got something on your mind.
{10426}{10549}- Say what you're thinking.|- We've been through it all before, Pa.
{10551}{10657}Don't paddle around with me. You|were raised to say what you think.
{10660}{10731}You were all raised|to say what you think.
{10734}{10926}The only thing I can't stand is a lot of|noisy silence. Let's have some talking.
{10929}{11051}Now, if you're going to make|a speech, I'm sorry I said it.
{11078}{11161}I know how you feel|about this war, Pa.
{11164}{11255}I guess we all more or|less feel the same way.
{11258}{11352}But I don't see how we can just|sit by and ignore it any longer.
{11355}{11439}Now, you say it's not our|business, not our fight.
{11441}{11590}Well, we're Virginians. I believe anything|that concerns Virginia concerns us.
{11593}{11686}- You do?|- Yes, sir, I do.
{11689}{11741}All right.
{12073}{12132}- John?|- Sir?
{12135}{12297}What are you gonna do? Are you going|to keep your slaves or let 'em go free?
{12324}{12390}You know I don't have any slaves, Pa.
{12393}{12537}That's right, John. You don't|have a slave to your name, do you?
{12569}{12681}James, what about you? Did you ever|think you might like to own a slave?
{12684}{12795}- I guess I never thought about it, Pa.|- Well, think about it.
{12798}{12860}Think about it.
{12863}{12949}If you had the money,|would you buy a slave?
{12951}{13032}- No, sir, I wouldn't.|- Why not?
{13035}{13152}If I can't do my own work, with|my own hands, it'll never get done.
{13155}{13239}Suppose you had a|friend that owned slaves,
{13241}{13332}and suppose somebody's|gonna take 'em away from him.
{13335}{13429}- Would you help him fight to keep 'em?|- No, sir.
{13431}{13555}- Your name's Nathan, isn't it?|- Aw, you know my name, Pa.
{13557}{13671}Well, I seem to remember somethin'|about... I was talking to Henry.
{13674}{13759}- Sir?|- Well, what do you think?
{13761}{13838}- No, sir, I wouldn't.|- Why not?
{13841}{13939}I see no reason to fight for|something I don't believe is right.
{13941}{14006}I don't think a real|friend would ask me to.
{14009}{14158}Why we have this same conversation|every Saturday, I'll never know.
{14161}{14274}But I'm going to pray to the Almighty|that this'll be the end of it.
{14276}{14351}Pass the biscuits!
{15119}{15212}Papa? We're ready to go, Papa.
{15255}{15332}You still miss her, don't you, Papa?
{15335}{15400}Miss her?
{15402}{15540}Oh, Jennie, you don't know|what I feel when I come up here.
{15542}{15662}Even after all these|years. 16 years gone.
{15665}{15716}16 years.
{15719}{15781}And even so, I...
{15784}{15978}I somehow... feel that she's not|dead at all, but only resting.
{15981}{16159}And it's like I'm just waiting for|her to get up and walk home with me.

{18466}{18657}# When my eyes shall close in death
{18660}{18816}# When I rise to worids unknown
{18834}{19011}# And behold Thee on Thy throne
{19014}{19192}# Rock of Ages, cleft for me
{19195}{19416}# Let me hide myself in Thee
{19429}{19660}# Amen
{19867}{19962}There are, no doubt, some|present, Charlie Anderson,
{19965}{20092}who wonder why you and yours are|never on time for the Lord's services.
{20095}{20228}Have I kept the Lord|waiting, Pastor Bjoerling?
{20231}{20324}You have not.
{20443}{20583}Our message for today... is duty.
{20637}{20746}Now, this means many|things to many people.
{20748}{20873}But for a Virginian|they all lead to one.
{21158}{21221}James.
{21271}{21358}- Get that fish line.|- The three...
{21361}{21467}most important duties are...
{21470}{21641}- Tell him to stop that.|...duty to God that created us,
{21643}{21696}and loves us.
{21773}{21937}Duty to the state that|gives us sustenance,
{21940}{22021}and provides for us.
{22065}{22188}And duty to our neighbour.
{22243}{22302}Our fellow man,
{22305}{22439}without whom... we... could not live.
{22508}{22642}When you good people can|find it within yourselves
{22645}{22762}to refrain from doing|whatever it is you're doing,
{22765}{22838}I'll get on with the Lord's work.
{22841}{22937}Duty, to a Virginian,
{22940}{23004}is not just a word, my friends.
{23216}{23312}For the last time, Charlie|Anderson, I need that mule of yours.
{23315}{23406}I don't understand your|reluctance to talk about the sale.
{23408}{23512}That mule is a matched Kentucky Red,
{23515}{23606}matched with another that|pulls just like she does.
{23608}{23717}Matched, Abernathy! Do you|understand what matched means?
{23720}{23779}- How much?|- 30 dollars, Federal.
{23782}{23964}- I'll give you 50, Confederate.|- I'll let lightning strike her first.
{24128}{24191}Miss Jennie?
{24217}{24314}I'll be leaving soon, and...
{24423}{24524}- I'll be leaving soon and...|- You said that already, Sam.
{24527}{24632}I did? Oh, yes, I did.
{24635}{24722}I, uh...
{24725}{24842}I'd be eternally grateful if you'd|permit me to call upon you this evening.
{24845}{24914}Eternally is a long time, Sam.
{24946}{25082}Not when one carries the|memory of you, Miss Jennie.
{25085}{25226}I'll look forward to seeing|you after supper, Sam.
{25470}{25594}Abernathy, your idea of a|deal makes my stomach hurt.
{25773}{25929}- You want me to get that mule now?|- Get in that wagon, Gabriel.
{26257}{26359}Charlie Anderson, I wonder if|you'd be good enough to tell me
{26362}{26504}why you bother to come to services.|Meaning no disrespect, of course.
{26507}{26632}It was my wife's last|request, Pastor Bjoerling.
{26634}{26722}Meaning no disrespect, of course.
{26979}{27042}Whoa, boy.
{27111}{27163}Doc. Mrs Witherspoon.
{27166}{27277}Charlie. Looks like I'll|be paying you a visit soon.
{27279}{27342}Uh huh.
{27818}{27888}You haven't said a word.
{27891}{27982}I don't know what to say. I mean...
{27984}{28107}Well, I know what to say.|I just don't know how.
{28109}{28174}Must be all very complicated, then.
{28177}{28269}No, it's... just all memorised.
{28272}{28383}Everything I wanted to say,|I've said a dozen times.
{28386}{28472}I said it to my horse|and it sounded good.
{28474}{28578}I said it again to the|trees and it sounded better.
{28614}{28707}I said it to the moon|and it sounded perfect.
{28709}{28784}The moon can't hear you, Sam.
{28787}{28889}He smiles and smiles,|but he never hears.
{28922}{28984}I do.
{29771}{29851}Well, I'm sure gonna miss her.
{29853}{29925}Is she going somewhere?
{29928}{30012}Every woman goes|somewhere sooner or later.
{30014}{30137}You don't expect her to stay here and|take care of us all her life, do you?
{30139}{30243}I hadn't thought about it. I hadn't|planned on her going anywhere.
{30246}{30361}Well, you'd better get|used to the idea, Boy.
{30364}{30472}Your sister's ripe and|the pickers are here.
{30503}{30632}Of course, I don't suppose you|know what I mean, do you, Boy?
{30634}{30728}I'm not as dumb as you think I am, Pa.
{31144}{31223}Whoa! Halt!
{31244}{31325}Go back up to the house, Boy.
{31728}{31869}There's a rumour you have the coldest|water this side of the Shenandoah.
{31872}{31967}That's right. The best|east of the Mississippi.
{31969}{32085}Six foot deep, 20 foot|down. Help yourself.
{32088}{32163}Dismount, Sergeant.
{32252}{32409}Glad you're here, Johnson. I need to have|a little talk about those cannon of yours.
{32412}{32563}My chickens have stopped laying, the|cow's dried up. Who do I send the bill to?
{32565}{32694}You might try Abe Lincoln.|They're mostly his.
{32697}{32800}When are you going to take|this war seriously, Mr Anderson?
{32803}{32927}Now let me tell you something, Johnson,|before you get on my wrong side.
{32929}{33028}My corn I take serious|because it's my corn.
{33030}{33167}My potatoes and tomatoes and fences|I take note of because they're mine.
{33169}{33275}But this war is not mine|and I take no note of it.
{33339}{33498}You'll take notice when the Yankees|drop a cannonball in your parlour.
{33500}{33686}I might as well tell you now, I can't|think of another thing I wanna hear you say.
{34028}{34100}You have six sons,|don't you, Mr Anderson?
{34103}{34249}Does the size of my family have|some special interest for you?
{34252}{34370}As a matter of fact,|it does. We need men.
{34373}{34458}Two of these men here|are no more than 16.
{34460}{34558}It seems strange that none|of your sons are in the army.
{34560}{34690}It don't seem strange to me with all|the work there is to do around here.
{34693}{34814}I'll come right to the point.|I came out here to get 'em.
{34968}{35024}I say something funny?
{35027}{35143}You came all the way|out here to get my boys?
{35145}{35188}Yes, sir.
{35190}{35334}- Where are your sons now, Mr Anderson?|- You wanna see 'em, do you?
{35337}{35399}Yes, sir, I do.
{35532}{35598}Jacob?
{35657}{35713}James?
{35789}{35853}John?
{35855}{35911}Nathan?
{35982}{36024}Henry?
{36217}{36279}Boy?
{36489}{36579}If you've got anything to|say to 'em, they'll listen.
{36582}{36676}There's a Yankee army breathing|down your neck, Mr Anderson.
{36679}{36773}- You're town bred.|- I don't see what that has to do...
{36775}{36875}I've got 500 acres of|good, rich dirt here.
{36878}{37019}While the rains come and the sun shines,|it'll grow anything I've a mind to plant.
{37022}{37124}We've pulled every stump,|we've cleared every field,
{37127}{37214}and we did it ourselves,|without the sweat of one slave.
{37217}{37306}- So?|- "So"?
{37309}{37380}So can you give me one good reason
{37383}{37504}why I should send my family,|that took me a lifetime to raise,
{37507}{37629}down that road like a bunch of damn|fools to do somebody else's fighting?
{37632}{37725}Virginia needs all of|her sons, Mr Anderson.
{37728}{37828}That might be so, Johnson,|but these are my sons.
{37830}{37899}They don't belong to the state.
{37902}{38014}When they were babies, I never saw the|state coming round with a spare tit.
{38017}{38109}We never asked anything of|the state or expected anything.
{38111}{38233}We do our own living, and|thanks to no man for the right.
{38235}{38326}But seeing as how you're so|worried about it, I'll tell ya.
{38329}{38479}If any of my boys thinks this war's right|and wants to join in, he's free to do it.
{38481}{38582}Y'all hear that? D'you hear it?
{38585}{38683}Do you want to dress up like|these fellas? Here's your chance.
{39169}{39246}Patrol, mount.
{39430}{39482}Mr Anderson,
{39485}{39654}if you can sit in the middle of this war|and not get touched, I congratulate you.
{39656}{39739}Where are these Yankees now?
{39741}{39814}About ten miles that way,
{39816}{39946}about ten or twelve miles that|way, and about five miles that way.
{39949}{40019}Which way are you headed?
{40021}{40084}That way.
{42494}{42587}What do you do with dead soldiers?
{42971}{43080}- Where's their army?|- Harrisonburg.
{43145}{43302}You ride over there, Nathan. Take Henry|with you, tell 'em to come get 'em.
{43305}{43367}Yes, sir.
{43445}{43545}Does it concern us now?
{43548}{43690}You go to the house, get|something and cover 'em up.
{44173}{44235}Come on.
{44719}{44812}- Don't you think we ought to wait?|- No.
{44961}{45074}Papa? Sam would like|to talk to you, Papa.
{45076}{45138}All right, Jennie.
{45286}{45376}- Good evening, sir.|- Sam.
{45722}{45779}It's bedtime.
{45781}{45862}Bedtime? Why, it's only...
{46384}{46466}Picker's here, Pa.
{46704}{46792}- What did he mean by that?|- It's nothing, Sam. Have a seat.
{46795}{46891}- I'd prefer to stand, sir.|- No, you sit down, Sam.
{46894}{46985}I never talk to a man|who's looking down on me.
{47120}{47246}Now, there's something you|want to talk to me about?
{47249}{47326}- Yes, sir.|- Sit down, Sam.
{47449}{47600}I've wanted to talk to you for|a long time now, sir, but...
{47602}{47715}Well, to come straight to the|point of the matter, sir, I...
{47717}{47907}- I want to ask for your daughter's hand.|- You mean you want to marry her, Sam?
{47922}{47985}Yes, sir.
{48061}{48142}- Why?|- Sir?
{48145}{48291}- Why do you want to marry her?|- Well, I... I love her, Mr Anderson.
{48475}{48549}Well, that's not good enough, Sam.
{48552}{48629}I beg your pardon?
{48632}{48702}- Do you like her?|- Well, I just said I...
{48705}{48880}No, you said you loved her. There's some|difference between loving and liking.
{48952}{49112}When I married Jennie's mother,|I didn't love her. I liked her.
{49115}{49195}I liked her a whole lot.
{49197}{49298}I liked Martha for at least|three years after we were married.
{49301}{49443}And then one day it just dawned|on me I loved her. I still do.
{49474}{49541}I still do.
{49544}{49685}You see, Sam, when you love|a woman without liking her,
{49687}{49847}a night can be long and cold, and|contempt comes up with the sun.
{49879}{49962}Do you understand all|this I'm telling you?
{49965}{50020}Yes, sir.
{50022}{50071}Well?
{50101}{50260}Well, I... I like Jennie,|sir. I've always liked her.
{50362}{50463}All right, then. You be good to her.
{50466}{50563}Because if you don't, it's|between you and me, boy.
{50597}{50747}- Then you have no objection, sir?|- I didn't say that.
{50750}{50843}Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
{50996}{51087}Thank you, sir. Thank you.
{51548}{51638}I suppose that means Papa|Charlie gave permissión?
{51641}{51828}Sam'll be a couple of miles down the|road before it dawns on him to tell me.
{52215}{52292}It was Mother's.
{52338}{52423}You'll look beautiful, Jennie.
{52426}{52589}Being married to someone you love|must be the most wonderful feeling.
{52592}{52706}When I was a little girl, I|slept all alone in a big room.
{52708}{52789}My bed had a feather mattress.
{52792}{52939}Outside, there was thunder, lightning|and rain falling on our tin roof.
{52942}{53101}I'd lie there under my blankets,|feeling so snug and good and warm.
{53103}{53267}Because I knew I was safe. I|was loved and somebody cared.
{53270}{53378}And now, married to James, it's|that same little-girl feeling.
{53381}{53541}- I'm loved, and somebody cares.|- Oh, I am so happy, I want to shout.
{53543}{53624}That's what it feels like, too.
{54963}{55043}First-rate-looking|animals you got here, son.
{55046}{55137}They should be. I do everything|but sing 'em to sleep.
{55140}{55306}Anderson's the name, Mr Carroll.|Nine horses and two mules.
{55308}{55406}You're right, Mr Tinkham.|These'll do just fine.
{55425}{55585}These folks sure know quality. I'll take|these two and four out in the pasture.
{55587}{55674}What do you mean, you'll take 'em?
{55746}{55898}Well, howdy, Mr Anderson. I|ain't seen you in quite a spell.
{55901}{56016}Well, I don't get around to|visiting jails much, Tinkham.
{56067}{56126}This here's Mr Carroll.
{56128}{56267}Mr Osborne, Mr Marshall. They're|Federal purchasing agents.
{56270}{56367}- Buying horses for the cavalry.|- That's right, Mr Anderson.
{56370}{56506}We've got a set price we can pay, but I'd|like to hear what you think they're worth.
{56508}{56596}The horses aren't for sale.
{56598}{56718}What my son tells you is|the gospel truth, gentlemen.
{56721}{56886}You can carve his words in stone if you've|a mind to. The horses are not for sale.
{56888}{56986}That may be, but I just|think I ought to tell you
{56988}{57083}we're authorised to|confiscate any we can't buy.
{57086}{57186}- What's "confiscate" mean, Pa?|- Steal.
{57242}{57314}No, I don't think|you quite understand.
{57317}{57462}You're not going to take one horse off|this farm. You might as well forget it.
{57559}{57629}You said these were reasonable people.
{57632}{57761}Mr Carroll, everybody in the county|knows they're just sitting out the war.
{57763}{57867}I think what Mr Tinkham|means is that he figured
{57869}{58037}anybody too yellow to fight wouldn't mind|making a couple of dollars off the war.
{58039}{58166}- "Yellow"?|- I apologise for my son's manners.
{58168}{58242}He was taught to have more|respect for his elders.
{58244}{58302}I accept your apology, sir.
{58304}{58397}Jacob, I don't know what gets|into you every once in a while.
{58399}{58471}You know you shouldn't|hit this gentleman,
{58473}{58587}as long as I'm around to do it!
{59259}{59322}James! Henry!
{61579}{61702}I'm not in the habit of making promises|to strangers, but you have my word.
{61704}{61842}If you don't get off this farm this|minute, I'm gonna shoot you stone dead.
{62886}{62955}That fella Tinkham,
{62958}{63132}he's the only man I know that started|at the bottom and went down in the worid.
{63134}{63243}He used to steal horses for|nothing. Now he gets paid for it.
{63246}{63356}Boy, get out of there|before you catch cold.
{63359}{63431}Go on in the house.
{63434}{63543}- See what you got us into?|- Me? You hit him.
{63545}{63628}You would have if I|hadn't beat you to it.
{63630}{63799}Pa, first it was Johnson,|and that was on our land.
{63802}{63958}Now they come driving right into our yard.|Aren't we going to do anything about it?
{63960}{64100}Well, I must be getting|old. Seems to me we just did.
{64405}{64524}It's no easy job, Sam,|taking care of a woman.
{64527}{64595}No, sir.
{64612}{64683}Yeah.
{64685}{64804}They expect things|they never asked for.
{64833}{64918}And when they don't get|them, they ask you why.
{64920}{65016}Sometimes they don't ask.
{65019}{65115}And they just go ahead and punish you
{65118}{65252}for not doing something you didn't|know you were supposed to do.
{65254}{65310}What, for instance, sir?
{65313}{65496}Well, that's a very difficult question|to answer, Sam. You're never quite sure.
{65528}{65663}It's just that it's sort|of, you might say, relative.
{65694}{65787}- Relative to what, sir?|- How they're feeling at the moment.
{65789}{65883}- How's that?|- You never know.
{65959}{66047}I don't believe I understand|what you're telling me, sir.
{66049}{66214}I know. I never understood it|myself. I never understood it.
{66217}{66317}It's just one of those things, Sam.
{66319}{66423}It's around. You just|don't ever see it.
{66474}{66551}Now, suppose...
{66554}{66689}Suppose Jennie started to cry one day.
{66692}{66790}You don't know what she's crying|about so you ask. You follow me?
{66793}{66843}Yes, sir.
{66880}{66968}You ask her, and she won't tell you.
{67014}{67178}And that's when you ask her what it|was you did that caused her to cry.
{67278}{67359}She still won't tell you.
{67390}{67498}And that's when you|start to get angry.
{67500}{67585}But don't get angry, Sam.
{67617}{67753}She won't tell you why she's|crying because she doesn't know.
{67755}{67845}Women are like that, Sam.
{67848}{68041}And it's exasperating. It's... urgh!|But don't let it make you angry.
{68078}{68138}No.
{68140}{68283}When she gets like that, just|walk up and hug her a little bit.
{68285}{68425}Cos that's all they really want|when they're like that, Sam.
{68428}{68540}A little loving. You|understand me, don't you?
{68594}{68653}No, sir.
{68655}{68717}You don't, huh?
{68867}{68999}There's something you must remember.|Husbands like to be alone once in a while.
{69002}{69064}Why?
{69115}{69269}You never know why. But I can always|tell when James wants to be alone.
{69272}{69445}A mood comes over him. I can always see|it in his eyes before it really gets there.
{69448}{69544}I don't know where the|mood comes from or why.
{69546}{69646}But that's when I leave him alone.
{69649}{69770}It seems sometimes things|get so thick around a man,
{69773}{69870}that he comes to feel|everything is closing in on him.
{69873}{70038}And that's when he wants to be left|alone. You understand, don't you?
{70086}{70149}No.
{70785}{70845}Dearly beloved,
{70848}{71040}forasmuch as marriage is a|holy estate, ordained by God,
{71043}{71146}to be held in honour by all...
{71500}{71627}To love and to cherish|till death us do part.
{71630}{71774}"According to God's holy ordinance,|and thereto I plight thee my troth."
{71776}{71864}According to God's holy ordinance,
{71866}{71964}and thereto I plight thee my troth.
{71991}{72136}"I, Jennie, take thee,|Sam, to my wedded husband."
{72139}{72239}I, Jennie, take thee,|Sam, to my wedded husband.
{72241}{72272}"To have..."
{72275}{72360}To have and to hold|from this day forward,
{72363}{72444}for better, for worse,
{72446}{72521}for richer or poorer,
{72524}{72599}in sickness and in health.
{72601}{72752}To love, cherish, to obey,|till death us do part.
{72781}{72861}According to God's holy ordinance.
{72864}{72944}And thereto I plight thee my troth.
{73211}{73344}"Receive this ring as a token|of wedded love and troth."
{73346}{73527}Receive this ring as a token|of wedded love and troth.
{73559}{73636}Join your right hands.
{73736}{73887}Forasmuch as Sam and Jennie have|consented together in holy wedlock,
{73890}{74040}and have declared the same before God|and in the presence of this company,
{74043}{74120}I pronounce them man and wife.
{74123}{74288}In the name of the Father and of|the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
{74290}{74446}What God hath joined together,|let not man put asunder.
{74496}{74586}Congratulations, Sam.
{74589}{74646}Jennie.
{74728}{74809}Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
{74918}{75040}- The captain's compliments, sir.|- Go on, Corporal.
{75064}{75260}He wishes to see you immediately. The|Yankees broke through at Winchester, sir.
{75263}{75337}Very well, Corporal.
{75774}{75899}I'll have to leave now.|You know that, don't you?
{76007}{76059}Do you understand?
{76130}{76187}Do you?
{76609}{76668}Ugh!
{76671}{76751}It's started.
{76754}{76847}- Pa!|- You just sit quiet.
{76850}{76966}Pa, something terrible's going to|happen if we don't get Ann home.
{76969}{77011}All right.
{77014}{77107}Take the carriage. Jennie|and I will go with Harkens.
{77110}{77187}Jacob, drive them home.|Nathan, go with them.
{77190}{77305}- Henry, you find Doc Witherspoon.|- What shall I tell him, sir?
{77307}{77421}- Nothing. When I send for him, he knows.|- Yes, sir.
{77727}{77817}I'll be back, sir,|just as soon as I can.
{77849}{77942}You take care of yourself, you hear?
{80137}{80259}Congratulations, son. It's|a boy. I know the sound.
{80312}{80375}Congratulations, James.
{80459}{80536}Ann wants to see you.
{80816}{80942}Something went wrong,|Charlie. I'm sorry.
{81027}{81098}It's a girl.
{81292}{81325}James?
{81329}{81453}- No. I might break it.|- How do you break an Anderson?
{82195}{82334}I don't know how you could bring yourself|to do this to me, Tom Witherspoon,
{82337}{82438}after all the business I've|given to you over the years.
{82441}{82570}It's not that I have any|objection to giris, you understand.
{82572}{82697}It's just that it's awful|hard to break a habit.
{82748}{82863}- How old are you now, Boy?|- 18, sir.
{82866}{83022}That means you'll be 20 in four|years. 18 to you is 16 to me.
{83025}{83115}Just a little bit, sir.|I've never tasted it.
{83117}{83278}That's no good reason. I've known men|that've been drinking hard all their lives.
{83281}{83386}They've never tasted it|either. Isn't that right, Doc?
{83388}{83452}All right, here we are.
{83455}{83527}Here we go.
{83530}{83594}Here's to the ladies.
{83746}{83881}- Well, these are busy days. Good night.|- Good night, Doctor.
{84182}{84238}Tom...
{84328}{84416}Tom, what's happening?
{84418}{84577}- Virginia's losing, isn't she?|- It looks that way, Charlie.
{84581}{84671}How do you feel about it all?
{84711}{84821}I was born in Virginia.|Lived here all my life.
{84823}{84946}Raised three sons and two|daughters under her flag.
{84948}{85086}My oldest son, Paul, is buried|somewhere in Pennsylvania.
{85088}{85186}I'm sorry. I didn't know that.
{85188}{85376}They said Gettysburg is where he fell,|at a place called Little Round Top.
{85411}{85540}My youngest boy came home|last week with tuberculosis.
{85571}{85654}He won't see another Christmas.
{85686}{85858}My third son rides with General|Forrest. I don't know where they are.
{85861}{86002}You... You were asking me|how I feel about it all.
{86005}{86131}That's the only way I|know how to answer you.
{86550}{86692}If she needs me, send for me.|There's another baby due up the river.
{86695}{86757}Go on.
{87473}{87532}Get out of here. Git!
{87536}{87653}Or go find yourself a tree.|Just don't draw no fire to me.
{87770}{87859}Get out of here. Get out of here now.
{87950}{88013}Get out of here.
{88168}{88267}Get out of here! Git! You hear?
{91223}{91323}Well, now, look how young this one is.
{91361}{91532}I swear to goodness if these Rebs ain't|gonna be sending out grandpappies next.
{91534}{91611}Let me hold that rifle, Johnny.
{91614}{91688}My name isn't Johnny.
{91691}{91776}- Let me have the rifle.|- What for?
{91817}{91965}It don't set right with the officers when|they see prisoners walking around armed.
{91968}{92143}Now give me that rifle before I put a|ball through that dumb head of yours.
{92233}{92293}I admire spunk in a boy.
{92296}{92405}But if you don't do|what I say from now on,
{92408}{92497}you're gonna find out spunk|don't come free for nothing.
{92499}{92621}- All right, Reb, let's go.|- I'm no soldier.
{92623}{92697}I don't look that ignorant, do I?
{92699}{92843}We seen enough of them Johnny|Reb caps to last us a lifetime.
{92936}{93039}- Go tell my Pa.|- Where they taking you, boy?
{93042}{93104}I don't know. Just|tell him what happened.
{93107}{93202}You don't have to tell his|pa nothing. You're free.
{94307}{94379}Master Anderson! Master Anderson!
{94460}{94520}- They took him.|- What are you saying?
{94523}{94620}- They took him.|- Who's "they"? Who'd they take?
{94623}{94718}- The Yankee men. They took the Boy.|- How many Yankee men?
{94720}{94839}I don't know. Five, six. I don't know.
{95063}{95140}Now it concerns us.
{95509}{95623}Nothing. There's footprints,|but they don't lead anywhere.
{95648}{95727}We haven't seen another|man since we left the house.
{95729}{95794}What do we do now?
{95797}{95938}Well, we'll go home|and we'll pack up...
{95999}{96076}and we'll leave tonight.
{96600}{96689}It's late. Won't Mr|Abernathy be looking for you?
{96692}{96831}He gone, Missy. Gone to Richmond.|Left the field boss in charge.
{96834}{96900}Won't he be wondering where you are?
{96903}{97049}Old Jethro don't care about me. When|my momma died, he even took our cabin.
{97052}{97133}I don't got to go back, do I, Missy?
{97135}{97257}Man say I'm free. Don't that|mean I don't gotta go back?
{97259}{97371}Well, if the man said|you were free, Gabriel,
{97374}{97514}I guess that means you can go|anywhere in the worid you wanna go.
{97714}{97855}You mean I can just walk on down|that road and keep on walkin'?
{97858}{97924}You can run if you like, Gabriel.
{98074}{98136}Goodbye, Missy.
{99079}{99176}We can probably make better|time if we stay off the roads.
{99179}{99323}We can cut across here. There's a Unión|camp the other side of the ford. Here.
{99325}{99433}- Is that the closest?|- Yes, sir, far as I know.
{99435}{99578}The ones that took the Boy were probably|skirmishers. I don't think we'd find 'em.
{99580}{99681}- They turned him in as a prisoner?|- That's about all they can do.
{99684}{99840}All right, we'll try that one.|Mount up. I'll be with you directly.
{100234}{100296}Come in.
{100407}{100484}Hello, Papa Charlie.
{100577}{100716}Well, I think she's|getting bigger than you are.
{100801}{100921}Ann, we're leaving, and|James is staying with you.
{100953}{101092}I don't know how these people|dare take a son of mine.
{101124}{101245}When I catch them, it's gonna|be a horrible thing to behold.
{101248}{101338}The Boy means a great|deal to you, doesn't he?
{101355}{101435}All of my sons mean|a great deal to me.
{101438}{101514}But the Boy...
{101516}{101606}My Martha died the night he was born.
{101609}{101678}I look at him, I see her.
{101758}{101800}I'll pray for you.
{101803}{101955}It's too late to do any praying for|me and expect satisfactory results.
{101985}{102046}There.
{102049}{102121}You and James decided on a name?
{102153}{102215}Martha.
{102261}{102331}Oh, she'd like that.
{102363}{102448}My Martha'd like that very much.
{102520}{102576}Ann...
{102625}{102810}I haven't told you, but we're all|mighty proud to have you in our family.
{102884}{102961}I love you very much.
{103854}{103957}Now, you take care of|yourself. You hear me?
{103960}{104051}We'll be back, just as soon as...
{104185}{104319}- Where do you think you're going?|- Wherever you go, Papa.
{104321}{104454}From what these preachers tell me,|where I'm going, you wouldn't like it.
{104456}{104541}You may be on your way,|but you aren't there yet.
{104544}{104624}Never mind that. You're|not going with us.
{104626}{104736}So unstrap, unhook, get out of your|brother's clothes. You're a woman.
{104739}{104944}I'm a woman, but I don't see anybody|here I can't outrun, outride and outshoot.
{104946}{105039}I'll unstrap for|you, Papa. And unhook.
{105041}{105135}I'll even sit here and|watch you ride out of sight.
{105138}{105215}- And then what?|- I'll follow.
{105218}{105270}That's what I thought.
{105273}{105358}Don't worry about the place|here, Pa. We'll manage.
{105360}{105443}You just keep that little|Martha warm and fat.
{105445}{105581}She'll probably turn out to be the|only one around here with a brain.
{105584}{105669}- Bye, son.|- Goodbye, Pa.
{107639}{107713}You the leader of this band of fools?
{107716}{107795}Colonel Fairchild is my name.
{107797}{107972}Whether or not I am the leader of fools|is a question which often enters my mind.
{107975}{108078}To whom do I have the|pleasure of speaking, sir?
{108081}{108161}Charlie Anderson is my name.
{108164}{108280}You better decide later whether|speaking with me is a pleasure or not.
{108282}{108383}- You have business with me?|- Yes, sir, I do.
{108386}{108510}All right, Mr Nelson.|What can I do for you, sir?
{108512}{108602}Well, you can return|my son, for a start.
{108605}{108715}Then you can issue some kind of|order, or whatever it is you do,
{108717}{108840}and instruct your people to keep off|my farm and leave my family alone.
{108842}{108927}- Your son?|- My youngest son.
{108930}{108999}Your people came on|my farm and took him.
{109001}{109099}- Why?|- That's what I'd like to know, Colonel.
{109101}{109252}- He's a prisoner and your army's got him.|- He isn't a Confederate?
{109255}{109379}No, sir. He's an Anderson,|and that's all he is.
{109381}{109469}- How old is he?|- He's 16.
{109729}{109848}Could you show me on the|map where your farm is?
{109851}{109928}Well, it's Shenandoah Gap.
{109990}{110082}It shows here. Right there.
{110085}{110187}It couldn't have been any|of my men who took your son,
{110190}{110286}because we haven't|been in your section.
{110289}{110374}But I think you should|understand something.
{110376}{110520}My men fought a battle the other day|with Rebels who threw stones at them,
{110522}{110585}because that was all that they had.
{110587}{110772}We took 1500 prisoners and there wasn't|50 rounds of ammunition among them.
{110804}{110857}What are you telling me, Colonel?
{110860}{110947}Only that what you're trying|to do is nearly impossible.
{110950}{111074}Every corps in our army is taking|thousands of prisoners each day.
{111076}{111202}How do you expect to|find one 16-year-old boy?
{111654}{111800}If I had him, Mr Anderson, I'd give him|to you. But I don't have any prisoners.
{111802}{111927}We sent them all to the|railroad for shipment north.
{112045}{112171}If you find the boy, give this|slip to the officer in charge.
{112174}{112222}- It may help.|- What is it?
{112225}{112341}It's a statement from me that|your son was taken by mistake,
{112344}{112528}and it would be considered a personal|favour to me if he is released to you.
{112531}{112621}Where's that railroad you|send your prisoners to?
{112624}{112692}It's at lvy Glen.
{112724}{112877}I do wish you good luck, Mr Anderson.|I have a 16-year-old son, too.
{112880}{113033}He's in school in Boston... thank God.
{113582}{113647}No stragglers back there!
{113695}{113776}All right, keep moving.
{113936}{114061}Go on inside. Keep those|men moving back there.
{114103}{114181}All right, move along.
{114365}{114473}The Boy couldn't be|with them, could he, Pa?
{114867}{114956}- I've a note for Captain Richards.|- Sir?
{115147}{115242}- You Anderson?|- I'm Anderson.
{115245}{115317}There's nothing I can do for you.
{115320}{115444}I don't recall asking you to do|anything for me. I'm looking for my son.
{115447}{115538}- I don't have him.|- How do you know that?
{115541}{115712}All I'm asking is to look through these|cattle cars. Is that too much to expect?
{115715}{115853}If your son is among these prisoners,|you're too late. There's a war going on.
{115856}{115969}- Sergeant! Lock 'em up.|- All right, lock 'em up.
{115972}{116112}- We have schedules to meet.|- Lock 'em up.
{116527}{116597}What'd he say, Pa?
{116600}{116687}He says he has schedules to meet.
{118230}{118292}Sergeant!
{118510}{118584}Get this stuff off|of the tracks, mister.
{118587}{118661}What are you doing? Know|what the penalty is...
{118663}{118834}You'd all please me if you'd drop your|guns and stick your hands up in the air.
{118837}{118939}- Drop the rifles!|- Right now!
{119173}{119276}Now I remember. Anderson.|Your name is Anderson.
{119278}{119366}You can all turn around|and start walkin'.
{119368}{119466}I don't care where you go, as|long as you get out of my sight.
{119468}{119608}- You're the man looking for his son.|- You're the man with schedules to keep.
{119611}{119694}Come on, move out. Come on, let's go.
{119697}{119814}Let's go, Captain. You|heard him. Come on. Move.
{119916}{120003}How long do you intend to|keep my train here, sir?
{120006}{120159}I'm glad you asked, because I believe|in a man knowing all about his business.
{120162}{120263}First I'm gonna empty your|train, and then I'm gonna burn it.
{120266}{120356}- Burn it?|- Open up those doors.
{120387}{120507}You can't do that. You|can't burn my train.
{120509}{120581}Maybe. You gotta give|me credit for trying.
{120583}{120723}- But why? Why?|- It's not the kind of a train I favour.
{121033}{121127}You can get out. You're free.
{122262}{122319}Boy?
{122716}{122778}Jacob!
{122943}{123024}Boy's not here, Jennie.
{123992}{124084}- Sam!|- Jennie...
{124489}{124649}You'd better leave soon. There's a|regular cavalry patrol on these railroads.
{124797}{124922}- Pa? What about the train, Pa?|- Uh, sir?
{124973}{125115}Sir, I've been the engineer|on this train for ten years.
{125118}{125200}She's been a good train|all that time and, well...
{125203}{125338}it ain't right to burn her just|cos she come onto hard times.
{125364}{125465}Now, you run a sad|kind of a train, mister.
{125468}{125640}It takes people away when they don't|wanna go, and won't bring 'em back.
{125643}{125754}But I'll leave it to the|ones that were on it. Sam?
{126089}{126172}Burn it.
{126207}{126319}Burn the train! Burn it!
{126544}{126715}Henry, give Sam the Boy's horse. The|rest of you, get mounted. Come on.
{126959}{127129}You be the only officer here, sir, and|the boys are after knowing what to do.
{127184}{127267}- Go home.|- Home, sir?
{127269}{127373}The war is lost. Go|back to your families.
{127500}{127658}I had no right to tell him that, but|those men can't go through another fight.
{127660}{127750}We knew before the last|one we couldn't win.
{127753}{127825}Why'd you go?
{127852}{127954}Easier than running, I guess.
{128070}{128189}If there's a cavalry patrol|around, we'd better move.
{129118}{129177}Hello, Carter.
{129179}{129310}You can have your chance tonight,|Boy, if you wanna take it.
{129313}{129393}- Chance for what?|- To run.
{129424}{129566}They don't waste many men on prisoner|duty and they're usually the worst.
{129569}{129646}They plan on herding us|on that stern-wheeler.
{129649}{129775}Some of us don't fancy no|sightseeing trip up north.
{129778}{129932}When they open that gate tonight, stick|as close to me as a flea on a hound dog.
{129935}{130068}There's something else. Once we|get going, you're on your own.
{130070}{130210}I gotta forget that you|ain't nothing but a lap baby.
{130734}{130846}Nathan, you and Henry take the|horses over to that barn there.
{130849}{130926}Yes, sir.
{131651}{131781}- Jacob, see if you can get a fire started.|- Yes, sir.
{132900}{133006}- Say, what's Pa doing in there?|- Sleeping, I guess.
{133009}{133070}I can hear him moving.
{133569}{133664}That's sure gonna|taste good about now.
{133695}{133786}For somebody, it is.
{133956}{134004}- Sam?|- Sir?
{134006}{134081}You too, Jennie.
{134405}{134467}Here.
{134878}{135015}Your mother and I had it a little better|than this. It's not very comfortable.
{135018}{135092}But when you've lived|together for years,
{135095}{135212}you'll realise that|comfort's not what counts.
{135339}{135489}It's customary for a gentleman to|carry his bride across the threshold.
{135568}{135684}So, if you wanna...|you can go ahead and...
{135768}{135830}Yes, sir.
{136294}{136406}- What are you looking at?|- Nothing, sir.
{136714}{136807}All right, move along. Move along.
{136810}{136872}Inside!
{137065}{137127}- Move along there.|- Now!
{137171}{137246}Get that other guard.
{137249}{137340}Come on. Come on. This way.
{137541}{137618}Get down. Get down.
{138184}{138261}Get down. Get down.
{140487}{140571}Them blue-bellies must be everywhere.
{140574}{140708}What we're gonna have to do is travel|at night, heading south. Always south.
{140711}{140810}Then we can't hardly help|coming on something friendly.
{140812}{140900}But our farm is north.
{141689}{141860}- You hear something?|- I smell something. Wood smoke.
{142111}{142188}That's a Confederate camp.
{142191}{142331}Wood smoke ain't all you|smelled. You smelled country boys.
{142676}{142770}I gotten these over|at the hospital wagon.
{142772}{142870}Fellas they belonged to|won't be needing 'em no more.
{142872}{143022}The lieutenant says they'll be pulling|back and we're welcome to go with them.
{143025}{143096}That was good of him.
{143222}{143318}- What is this?|- Don't ask.
{143321}{143476}It ain't nothing your mama ever set|the table with, you can believe that.
{143479}{143626}But we're walking in tall cotton, Boy.|Down in Vicksburg, they're eating rats.
{145058}{145125}Yankees! Yankees!
{145301}{145371}Here, take this.
{145817}{145883}Don't fire till I tell you.
{145886}{145969}I've never shot at a man before.
{145972}{146039}They ain't gonna know that.
{146847}{146923}- Lieutenant?|- Yes, sir?
{146926}{147008}Is that a Confederate|cow or a Unión cow?
{147011}{147086}That must be a Unión cow, sir.
{147088}{147191}- Are Unión cows tasty?|- Quite tasty, sir.
{147193}{147274}- Then take her prisoner.|- Yes, sir.
{147376}{147411}Hyah!
{148772}{148807}Sorry, sir.
{148810}{148983}That's all right, Lieutenant.|You scared a few pounds off her.
{148986}{149017}Get ready.
{149020}{149058}Fire!
{149323}{149361}Fire!
{149800}{149862}Charge!
{149920}{149982}Charge!
{150188}{150244}Fire!
{151184}{151256}You might as well know|something now, Boy.
{151258}{151387}In case you got any doubts, we|ain't got a dog's chance in hell.
{152026}{152150}I ain't never seen nobody get|so peevish over a cow before.
{152881}{152943}What you...
{155182}{155244}Howdy!
{155336}{155412}Hello.
{155414}{155475}What can I do for you?
{155478}{155580}Just a drink of your|water, if you don't mind.
{155583}{155701}Come a long ways.|Got a long ways to go.
{155704}{155832}You're welcome to all you can|drink and all you can carry.
{155864}{155927}Obliged.
{155929}{156057}Nice place you got here.|Must support quite a few.
{156059}{156180}- Nine.|- Nine? Lmagine that.
{156212}{156359}How come I don't see none|of 'em around... except you?
{156362}{156449}They're all away|from home for a while.
{156849}{156939}Aw, Mule, you sure do a job up right.
{156942}{157055}Yeah, I'm bound to|say it. You sure do.
{157115}{157226}You two look around and|see if they got any horses.
{157229}{157325}I'll see what's in the house.
{157328}{157393}Yeah.
{158837}{158914}James?
{159330}{159388}- Mule?|- James!
{159445}{159508}James!
{160799}{160839}This all there is?
{160842}{161000}We used the last of the flour yesterday,|and this is the last of the coffee.
{161243}{161355}You don't think we're going|to find him, do you, Sam?
{161384}{161438}No, sir, I don't.
{161479}{161633}Boy could be any place, Pa. He may|even be somewhere up north by now.
{161635}{161754}- Federal prison, you mean?|- Yes, sir.
{161774}{161950}The horses haven't had a good feed in|a long time, Pa. They're almost spent.
{161953}{162025}I wanna say something.
{162057}{162151}I've known since the train that|we weren't liable to find him.
{162154}{162266}It was just a hair of a|chance that we got Sam back.
{162269}{162389}I knew that... Maybe I knew|even before we left home.
{162392}{162534}But somehow I just had to try.
{162552}{162694}And if we don't try, we don't do.
{162725}{162805}And if we don't do,
{162837}{162924}why are we here on this earth?
{163069}{163131}I...
{163156}{163250}I hope you all understood.
{163253}{163356}We understood you, Pa,|and we're all with you.
{163390}{163465}Tomorrow morning we'll start back.
{163619}{163676}Pa...
{163744}{163864}I'll admit I don't feel|the same way I did before.
{163866}{163944}And I'll admit that I'd|sure like to get home.
{163946}{164046}But I don't want you|giving up because of us.
{164049}{164205}I'm with you. I don't wanna go|home unless you really want to.
{164294}{164351}Thank you, son.
{164414}{164507}We'll go home. Maybe the Boy's there.
{166326}{166420}Hold your fire, men. Hold your fire.
{167245}{167324}Dead!
{167721}{167795}How old are you?
{167833}{167925}- How old?|- 16.
{168123}{168205}I'm not gonna kill you.
{168208}{168294}I want you to live.
{168296}{168397}I want you to live to be an old man.
{168400}{168577}And I want you to have|many, many, many children.
{168580}{168711}And I want you to feel|about your children then
{168714}{168795}the way I feel about mine now.
{168853}{168927}And some day,
{168960}{169152}when a man comes along and kills one|of them, I want you to remember. I...
{169412}{169495}I want you to remember.
{170836}{170961}We'll bury him on the|farm, near his mother.
{172669}{172827}- Somebody sick, Tom?|- Where have you been?
{172830}{172892}What's wrong?
{172937}{173053}- What's wrong? The baby...|- The baby's all right, Charlie.
{173056}{173100}Uh...
{173102}{173203}James and Ann...
{173224}{173298}are dead.
{173486}{173543}We...
{173546}{173627}We figured scavengers did it.
{173630}{173718}From what I could tell,
{173721}{173802}James died instantly.
{173840}{174000}It wasn't until two days later|I just happened to come by.
{174002}{174065}Ann had...
{174096}{174155}She was dead, too.
{174157}{174261}I had them buried near Martha.
{174290}{174472}I thought you'd like that. It|somehow seemed the only place.
{174505}{174602}- Where's the baby, Tom?|- Upstairs.
{174605}{174682}I found a woman to take care of her.
{174712}{174776}She's all right, Charlie.
{176122}{176194}The child is my granddaughter.
{176432}{176509}Her name is Martha.
{176793}{176918}It's been a long time,|Martha, since I held a baby.
{176988}{177066}It's been a long time.
{177225}{177328}O Lord, we cleared this land.
{177366}{177446}We ploughed it and sowed it,
{177477}{177539}and harvested.
{177607}{177690}We cooked the harvest. We...
{177723}{177773}It wouldn't...
{177776}{177959}It wouldn't be here, we wouldn't be|eating it, if we hadn't done it all...
{177962}{178037}all ourselves.
{179825}{179981}I don't even know what to|say to you any more, Martha.
{180051}{180182}There's nothing much I can|tell you about this war.
{180220}{180323}It's like all wars, I suppose.
{180326}{180406}The undertakers are winning it.
{180408}{180541}The politicians talk a|lot about the glory of it.
{180543}{180658}And the old men will|talk about the need of it.
{180715}{180827}The soldiers, they just wanna go home.
{180965}{181168}I guess you're not so lonely|now, Martha, with James and Ann...
{181171}{181237}and Jacob.
{181240}{181317}And maybe the Boy.
{181380}{181564}You didn't know Ann, did|you? Well, you'll like her.
{181567}{181773}You'll like her a lot, Martha. Why,|she and James are so much alike.
{181776}{181901}They're just like we... No.
{181941}{182126}We were never that much alike,|were we, Martha? We just sort of...
{182128}{182232}We just sort of grew|alike through the years.
{182263}{182343}But... I-I wish...
{182458}{182643}I wish I could just know what|you're thinking about it all, Martha.
{182677}{182787}Then maybe things|wouldn't look so bad to me.
{182789}{182902}If I only knew what you thought.
{183213}{183272}Ah, you...
{183274}{183359}You never give up, do you?
{183757}{183886}Thought you'd get away with it, huh? Why|didn't one of you tell me it was Sunday?
{183888}{183988}Now, come on, get|cleaned up. We're late.
{184031}{184107}- You have something to say?|- No, sir.
{184109}{184219}Well, then, saddle your|horses. Get my carriage.
{184413}{184589}#... goods and kindred go
{184592}{184794}# This mortal life also

{186082}{186182}For our second hymn,|we'll turn to page...
{186334}{186389}How long, O Lord?
{186552}{186672}With God's help, we'll turn to page...
{187464}{187549}Shall we all rise and sing?

This is the Australian Broadcasting
Commission. And now the news.
Japanese forces continue their heavy attack on the Philippines
and Dutch East Indies.
Occupation of Manila is now complete
with American and Philippine forces under the command of General MacArthur
withdrawing to the Bataan Peninsula.
His Majesty's forces are carrying out an orderly evacuation
of the New Guinea coast, in preparation for defence of Port Moresby and...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
? I got me ten fine toes to wiggle in the sand
? Lots of idle fingers snap to my command
? A lovely pair of heels that kick to beat the band
? Contemplating nature can be fascinating
? Add to these a nose that I can thumb
? And a mouth, by gum, have I
? To tell the whole damn world if you don't happen to like it
? Deal me out, thank you kindly, pass me by
? Pass me by, pass me by
? If you don't happen to like it, pass me by?
Hey, hey, hey. Get off.
Boom...
Here, just a minute.
Where do you think you're going with those, hmm?
Do you know who I am?
Um... Not exactly, no.
Well, we'll let it go this time.
Yes, sir. I understand.
Salamaua will be cleared by noon the latest.
Nothing the Japanese will be able to use.
Sir, there's a chap outside who...
May I respectfully remind the admiral that
I was harbour master here for 20 years?
I helped put the docks together so I should certainly be able to blow them apart.
Sir, there's a chap outside who's pinching our petrol.
All coastal watching stations are assigned, except...
- Matalava, sir.
- Except Matalava, sir.
I haven't been able to find a replacement for Anderson. There are no civilians.
We could have transferred George Dickens if he hadn't got himself eaten that way.
You needn't make him sound such a shirker, Stebbings.
What's that, sir?
For want of a nail? The war was...
Yes, I'm well aware of that, sir.
Hello, hello, hello.
I think I may have found our nail, sir.
A rusty one, I grant you, but they don't come any sharper. Excuse me, sir.
Sir, that's the chap I was telling you about.
Later, Stebbings.
Who is he, sir?
Is he someone I should know?
He's Walter Eckland, an American. Knows these islands like the back of his hand.
Oh. Well, now that America's in the war, he's probably on his way back to enlist.
Eckland's not on his way anywhere,
Stebbings. Hasn't been for years.
Hello, Walter.
Frank! That you inside there?
What have you done to yourself?
- There's a war on.
- Everybody's saying that.
- At the moment, we're losing.
- I guess you must be.
Cheek of the man!
That's quite a boat you have there.
Doesn't it belong to old Van Der Hoeven?
- No.
- Whose is it, then?
- Mine.
- How did you get it?
- I bought it from old Van Der Hoeven.
- What with?
American dollars.
You've never had more than $200 at one time since I've known you.
You can't tell me Van Der Hoeven sold you an $18,000 launch for $200.
- No, it cost me $400.
That's the way he said it.
I told him he might as well sell it to me as let the Japanese have it for free.
What impresses me is the fact that you even had $400.
Well, I didn't. I only had 200, just as you said. I owe him the rest.
Well, come along. Lend a hand. Come on.
Empty hands make idle minds.
Here, pick those up.
- Er...
- No, no, no. Two. Come on.
? Contemplating nature can be fascinating?
Do you know what the coastwatching service is, Walter?
- I beg your pardon?
- It's a chance to become a hero.
Why would I want to do that?
It's a cushy assignment for anyone who knows these waters.
Never a dull moment, I can tell you.
Working behind enemy lines...
Stebbings, please.
Walter, listen to me.
There's nothing to it really. Each man is assigned an island, often uninhabited.
He stays there alone and radios to headquarters any movement of Japanese planes or ships which...
- You're not listening to me, are you?
- Hold it, hold it.
Hey, hey, hey! Come on!
Beat it, scram! Come on! Get off!
Did you hear what I was saying?
- What were you saying?
- About the coastwatchers.
Matalava will be in the centre of things when the Japanese move towards New Guinea.
It's important work, Walter, damned important, but I'd like you to volunteer.
Oh, I'd love to, but I've only just volunteered for another watching service, the Watch Out For Walter Eckland service.
A great many lives are at stake, Mr Eckland.
Now listen to me, both of you.
Several years ago,
I made peace with the world.
If the world isn't bright enough to make peace with itself, it can do without me.
It isn't anything permanent, Walter.
It's just until I find a replacement for you.
The other man went down with fever and we had to take him off.
Well, now, Frank.
You've known me a long time.
Do you really think you'll talk me into it?
No, I suppose not.
Stebbings, confiscate all small craft on this pier.
- This is the only one there is, sir.
- Confiscate it.
- Frank, you won't get away with that.
- Proceed with your order.
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Frank, you can't do this to me!
- Who's in charge here?
- He is.
You can't do this to me!
That boat's all I have.
You said we've been friends for a long time, Walter.
Do you really think you could talk me out of it?
- If I go to Matalava, I keep the boat, right?
- Mm.
Well, there's no use fighting it.
What time do I shove off?
An hour be all right?
Anything you say, Frank. You're the skipper.
Hey, buddy. Lend me a hand with those cans. I'll get on board.
Sir, you don't really expect him to go to Matalava, do you?
- We'll never see him again.
- Where's your faith in human nature?
Oh, yeah.
- Good heavens!
- What is it?
He...
He made a gesture, sir.
You set a fine course there, Walter.
- My compliments.
- I should have led you up on the reef.
It's a sorry day when a man's friends don't trust him.
What about all those provisions? You don't suppose that boat of yours can carry them?
Frank...
I want you to take all those provisions, and I want you to...
Hey! Be careful with that!
We'll be at Kings Point in Australia.
When you call us, we want you to use the following code.
Kings Point is Briar Patch.
I'm Big Bad Wolf,
Stebbings here is Bo Peep, and you're...
- Mother Goose, sir.
- That's it. You're Mother Goose.
Now try to remember all that, Walter.
It's bloody important.
Yeah, bloody.
All right, then. Goodbye, Mother Goose.
Mother Goose...
- Let's get under way, Stebbings.
- Sir, it has occurred to me that as soon as we've gone,
Mr Eckland might...
- Proceed, Stebbings. Hard to port.
- All right. Coxswain, hard.
Excuse me, sir, but did you say...
- Hard to port, son.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Coxswain, hard to port.
Hey! Hold it, hold it! Are you crazy?
Look out, look out! Frank? Do you hear me?
Hard to starboard!
Frank, all of you, watch out!
Have you gone nuts?
Look out! Frank, can you hear me?
Hold it! Starboard, you ignorant, silly son of a...
Oh, great! Have you lost your mind?
Look at my boat.
Terribly sorry, Walter.
Our steering must have jammed.
I'm sorry.
If you didn't know how to work one of those, why didn't you say?
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, stop saying that. Look at my boat.
- What am I gonna do now?
- Become a coastwatcher, I expect.
Lucky we've put on a little surprise ashore.
Oh, Walter.
We'll stand by until you get safely in.
Frank, I'll sue ya! I'll sue!
I'll sue the entire war!
Quite right, Walter. I'll be your witness.
Oh, and Walter. Thanks for volunteering.
Oh, come on. Buzz off.
- Mother Goose?
- Frank!
- I knew you wouldn't leave me here!
- This is Big Bad Wolf.
Go away.
I know you're saying something, but I can't hear you. You've got to flip the key.
- I said go away.
- You're still not coming through.
There's a button on the microphone.
Press it down while you're speaking.
Can you hear me now?
That's better.
You'll find some charts there identifying enemy ships and aircraft.
Study them, will you?
Have you seen anything yet?
Any planes or ships?
- Yeah, some planes.
- Ours or theirs?
Kind of depends which side you're on.
News has just come through that the Japanese took Singapore this morning.
Frank, what keeps them from taking Walter Eckland?
We've 32 spotters spread over 3,000 islands.
The odds are in our favour that you'll never be found.
Our favour? You're not stuck out in the middle of nowhere. I am.
- Now when do I get off?
- As soon as we've found a replacement.
Meantime, be good enough to keep in touch, Walter.
Oh, and I am sorry about your boat.
I really am.
Is Big Bad Wolf really sorry?
Because if he is, Big Bad Wolf and Little Bo
Peep can do something for Mother Goose.
They can go...
I don't really blame him, do you?
I can't see what we've accomplished.
I don't think he'll report in.
You can lead a horse to water, but can you make it drink?
When he gets thirsty enough, he'll drink, Stebbings.
He'll drink.
Frank, can you hear me?
Frank?
- Load and clear. What is it?
- Where'd those men put the whiskey?
I've looked all over this dump.
Did they keep it for themselves?
Seamen of His Majesty's Navy?
You must be joking.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where is it?
Well, I can imagine how dull it must get for someone left all alone on a small island.
All right. Get to the bad news.
I decided to liven things up a bit by making a fun and game thing out of it.
What sort of fun and games?
I had my men hide all the bottles around the island.
In very unlikely places.
You'd never find them by yourself.
The ground rules are simple. You report an enemy ship or plane movement
and I tell you where the bottles are.
One report, one bottle.
Hold it a minute, Frank.
I hear a flight going over right now.
Just a minute while I get binoculars.
Oh, yes. There's six, seven, eight of them heading south.
They're er... Nakajima 97 s.
But just a minute while I verify that on the chart.
Walter, there is another rule attached to this.
It has to be a confirmed report.
- Confirmed how?
- By other spotters along the line.
Now just tell me what all those planes were that you saw.
Mm?
Frank? Frank. Frank.
Frank, wake up, Frank.
Frank?
Briar Patch here, Mother Goose.
Bo Peep speaking.
- Briar Patch? That's a new one, isn't it?
- We've moved.
- Are you at Kings Point already?
- Listen, you must use the code names.
If you don't like it, fire me. Get Houghton.
- The regulations...
- Frank here, Walter.
- Mother Goose, sir.
- What's new?
Five Mitsubishi light bombers at around 10,000, headed southwest.
- Southwest at 10 thou.
- Yeah.
Got it. Spot. Thanks.
Wait a minute. Whoa!
Fun and game time.
I played the game, how about the fun?
Confirmed, Walter, remember?
- But Frank, I swear!
- Then you've nothing to worry about.
Sit tight, Mother Goose.
Sit tight, sit tight...
Briar Patch here.
Are you there, Mother Goose?
I'm here, Frank. I'm here, I'm here.
We've just received news that your report has been confirmed.
- Congratulations.
- Never mind congratulations. Where is it?
Proceed 50 yards east northeast to a large rock.
Then 20 yards due east to a coconut palm.
Not so fast, not so fast. Wait a minute.
20 yards due east to a coconut palm.
Sir?
Sorry to disturb you but we've heard from Humpty Dumpty.
Oh, come on, Stebbings. You can tell me.
Who's Humpty Dumpty?
Perry on Bundi Island.
He reports enemy landings here on this fare, here and here on Greater and Lesser
Samengo, and here on Prince Consort.
They've ringed him in pretty well.
He says they don't know that he's there yet but expects someone any time now.
Well, Combat can't spare a thing.
All our planes and ships are committed.
Who's our nearest man?
I'm afraid... he is, sir.
Briar Patch calling Mother Goose.
Come in, Mother Goose.
Briar Patch calling Mother Goose.
Come in, Mother Goose.
Do you read me, Mother Goose?
This is Briar Patch.
Do you read me, Mother Goose?
Yes, yes. I read you. What's worse is I can hear you. What do you want?
Walter, I haven't been sleeping too well because I've treated you so badly
- so I'm gonna make it up to you.
- Whatever it is, the answer is no.
I don't blame you, sport.
I don't blame you at all.
- I'm not listening, Frank.
- Supposing someone repaired your boat.
- I'm listening, Frank.
- And after it's repaired,
to stay on there as your replacement.
- Who is he?
- Malcolm Perry, one of our regulars.
- When can he be here?
- Tonight too soon?
No, Frank. Tonight's just fine. Just fine.
There's just one small thing.
- Uh-oh.
- He can't get to you, you must fetch him.
- From where, Frank?
- Bundi Island.
Bundi? How do you suggest
I get there, Frank?
That launch of yours has a dinghy, doesn't it?
All those miles of open sea and back again in a seven-foot dink?
You're nuts!
- Shall I call him back, sir?
- No, no.
Frank?
Yes, Walter?
Suppose I could make it to Bundi, where would I put in? The south jetty?
That's right. Only be careful.
There's a pretty fair moon tonight.
You got some special reason for telling me that?
No, no, no.
Only it'd be better without a moon.
Er... Why, Frank?
Well, Bundi's liable to be occupied.
- With what, Frank?
- I didn't say it would be.
- Frank?
- Yes?
Kiss my foot, Frank.
If he leaves within the hour, he should make Bundi just after dark.
But sir, you heard what he said.
He won't go to Bundi.
Frank!
Yes, Walter.
All those miles of open sea, a man would need to keep warm, wouldn't he?
- Two bottles.
- All of them, Frank.
- Three.
- All of them, Frank.
- Five.
- All of them, Frank.
Got a pencil?
Number four is ten yards west of the shack under a mango.
All right.
Five is 30 paces from there, due north,
in a stunted palm.
Just a second. Slow down.
Number six is...
Perry?
- Who are you?
- I... I asked you first.
- Where's Perry?
- Who's Perry?
Perry. The man who lives here.
I buried him.
He was dead. I found him here. A Japanese plane must have attacked the house.
- How did you get here?
- I...
Duck.
They've passed by before. I think they are landing on the other side of the island.
What makes you think that?
- I saw them. You can look over there.
- Why would I do a silly thing like that?
- Let's get out of here.
- Do you have a boat?
No, I walked. Come on.
Come on, we're leaving now.
Look out. Come on, look out.
Just, er... Just...
What? What are all those?
As you can see, they're young ladies.
Now listen, Miss whatever your name is.
- Catherine Freneau.
- Charmed. Suppose you tell...
- What is your name?
- Er... Eckland.
- How do you do?
- How do you do? Now...
I don't know what this is all about but...
Please, Miss...
Um... I don't believe it. Miss? Mi...
Ssshh! Where is your boat? I can't see it.
Lady, it's right where we're standing.
If you spit, you'd sink it.
Oh, dear.
Oh, well. I suppose we'll just have to manage. Come on, girls. Into the boat.
Wait, wait, wait. Hold it.
Everybody settle down.
- You don't think they'll all fit in that?
- All right, Mr Eckland.
Which ones do you suggest we leave behind?
You decide. I'll leave it to you.
It's suicide.
- Would you stand a chance without me?
- Naturally.
Very well.
Well, I suggest you leave immediately.
Well, that's very decent of you.
You're a very good sport. Thank you.
The rest of you, snap it up.
Jenny, you're the smallest.
Sit in the back. You'll be out of the way.
Do you mind, lady?
This is my boat, such as it is.
If anyone's going to sink her, it'll be me.
I'll seat them.
You sit in the back. That's right.
Give it to me. Let go.
- Mr Eckland.
- There's no room for baggage. Come on.
My glasses.
- I don't want to go.
- That's tough. Come here.
Please, take your hand off that.
All right. Now.
- My scent.
- Huh?
Scent. It's called Anticipation.
Two pounds ten the ounce.
You don't say.
All right. Sit there. That's right.
Take your hands off that. Hey!
Ooh! Er... Just... What is that thing?
A cricket bat. Isn't it a smasher?
I only hope you all can swim.
Now take your hand off that.
Now you two. Get in the bottom of the boat.
Get in the...
- They don't understand English.
- Sure they do.
See?
Please!
All right.
- Now, I guess that's about all.
- Don't forget Gretchen.
- What?
- Don't forget Gretchen.
Oh, that's her friend. I'll help her in, dear.
Would you mind?
Oh...
Oh, dear...
Now, then, Mr Eckland,
I suggest you leave immediately.
Oh, lady? Lady?
Do you mind? Just get in the boat.
- You said...
- I don't care what I said.
If by some miracle we do make it, I'd be stuck with them. Now get in the boat.
All right.
That's it. No, no, no! Not that!
We'd have had a use for that. Come on.
Come on.
- It's all right, now. Don't be afraid.
- Quiet, quiet.
Keep the boat quiet.
The girls are extremely frightened.
Will you shut up, lady?
Get off my paddle.
I'm terribly sorry, but you put it there in the first place, you know.
Now, that's all right, children. There we go.
Mr Eckland. Must you?
What are you, some kind of religious fanatic?
I couldn't care less what you do to yourself, but must you do it in front of the children?
- No.
- Well, then.
Well, then, tell them to turn around.
That is not exactly what I had in mind,
Mr Eckland.
- Now, lady...
- It's Freneau. Catherine Freneau.
I don't know what you had in mind. I don't know you or why you were on that island.
Well, if you must know, an American plane left us there.
- We were on our way from...
- I wanna go home.
Oh, Anne, it's rude to interrupt.
We were going from New Britain to Port Moresby when the pilot was ordered to pick up eight survivors of an Australian bomber.
Hey, you. Take that bat or whatever it is out of the water. It's acting like a rudder.
Harriet, really.
- The name's Harri.
- All right. Harri.
He said he'd try and pick us up later but that was five hours ago and he...
- Quiet.
- You don't have to be so rude.
Quiet. I think I hear something.
Duck. Put your heads down. Do as I say.
Keep your faces covered.
Hey, keep your face down!
- Are they Japanese?
- I don't know. Do you want me to ask?
Hold on! We've got to ride out the wake.
- We're sinking!
- Don't just sit there, damn it! Bail!
Mr Eckland! Your language! Really!
Just bail! Do as I say!
Come on, all of you! You can move faster than that. Use your hands.
Come on, keep bailing. Faster.
Bail! What about you?
Come on, now! Get to work! Go on!
That's better.
- Hold on to the boat, Harri!
- Stay in the boat!
Well, really...
Come on, girls.
Right, come on.
Come on, then.
Kings Point? Get Houghton.
Is that you, Mother Goose?
Walter, I can't tell you how delighted I am.
Oh, you've Mother Goosed me for the last time.
- What do you mean?
- Don't play stupid with me.
You'd sell out your father if you know who he was.
Ooh...
Walter? Walter?
- Frank, get them off of here.
- Get who off?
- You know who. Get 'em off.
- No one could have known we were there.
- The radio was destroyed.
- Will you please stay out of this?
- I'm only trying to...
- I'm capable of handling this myself.
I'm hungry!
So am I!
Walter, what's...
Walter, who's...
Walter!
Thank you.
Now, suppose you tell me who's there.
- Well...
- I am Miss Catherine Freneau. Who is this?
Commander Frank Houghton of His
Majesty's Navy. What are you doing there?
- I'd like to hear that myself.
- I am the daughter of Charles Freneau, the French Consul at Rabaul.
- I heard children's voices.
- Yes.
I am in charge of seven students from the consulate school.
Four English, two French, one Australian,
all of them daughters of diplomatic personnel.
When the bombing started, it was decided to evacuate them to Australia.
Unfortunately, the plane our group was on put us down at Bundi.
And now Mr Eckland has been kind enough to bring us here.
- What about Malcolm Perry?
- Well, I'm sorry, Commander.
The house had apparently been attacked from the air and when we found him...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Commander, how soon do you think you'll be able to... arrange for our transportation?
I'd like to hear that as well, yeah.
That's a difficult question to answer,
Miss Freneau. If you'll be patient...
Never mind their patience, Frank.
It's my patience. Get them off of here.
All right, Walter.
I'll take it to the top. Stand by.
Stand by.
If you're waiting for the big finale, this is all I do.
- Son of a...
- Mr... Eckland!
I'm bleeding.
Oh, dear.
Mr Eckland, we could all do with some food.
Elizabeth. You and Harri open some tins.
And Christine and Jenny.
Find knives, forks and napkins.
That'll be a good trick. Napkins.
Angelique, Dominique, rangez cette table.
Oui, mademoiselle.
Hey! Be careful.
What are you doing with those?
- Tu comprends, toi?
- Pas un mot.
Where are your tea things?
- My what?
- Your tea things.
Last time I looked, they were next to the finger bowls.
Hey, hey! Be careful with that!
Didn't I tell you to...
Oh, it's an empty.
Are you standing by?
All set to go, Frank. What did you work out?
- A parachute drop.
- A what?
They've got to be picked up, not put down.
We thought you could do with provisions with all those extra mouths.
I want their mouths out of here.
When are you coming for them?
Well, that's rather difficult to say.
- Well, try saying today.
- I don't think it'll be today, Walter.
Well, what's making that parachute drop, a seagull?
We can only manage a night drop.
There's no way to land.
Frank, you still haven't said when you're gonna get them off.
No, I haven't, have I? Two or three weeks?
- Two or three?
- Four.
- Four?
- With luck.
We'll have to stay here a month?
I don't want to stay here.
Well, you've slipped it to me again, haven't ya?
I'm sorry, Walter. There's a war on.
Stop saying that!
Would you be so kind as to contact my father in Rabaul and have him inform the girls' parents that they're safe?
All civilian personnel are being evacuated from New Britain but I'll see to it that they're informed.
Signing off.
Three or four weeks.
I heard it. I heard that.
Mr Eckland, may I speak with you outside for a moment?
Some other time.
I've been up all night. I'm going to bed.
Girls?
Go outside and play.
But stay close to the house.
Stay off the beach or out in the open.
- Mr Eckland?
- Yes, sir.
It now appears likely we'll remain together here for some time to come.
This being the case, I think it would be wise of us to arrive at an understanding.
It must be quite clear to you that the children must be our first consideration.
Your first consideration.
I'm my first consideration.
They are young, sensitive and impressionable.
- So am I.
- They've been through a trying experience and they will need a normal, orderly routine established
- and I expect you to do your share.
- Oh, sure, sure.
It was one thing for you to live as you did when you were alone but you are no longer alone and your behaviour is totally unsuitable.
Uh-huh...
Your language is common, your eating habits...
- revolting.
- Oh, really?
Your appearance disgraceful, and...
And your drinking must stop immediately.
I will not have the children subjected to it.
You are, after all, the only man with whom they'll come in contact, the father figure.
- Are you finished?
- Yes.
Good, then let me tell you something.
I am not a father figure.
I am not an uncle figure, or a brother figure or a cousin figure.
In fact, the only figure
I intend being is a total stranger figure.
So now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to bed.
And now if I'm supposed to cover my eyes and run screaming, you'll be disappointed.
I doubt very much anything you could do would shock me.
Let me repeat.
My only concern is for the children.
Why don't you concern yourself with them and let me sleep?
Gladly. As soon as you've told me where we will stay.
Stay anywhere you like.
As this hovel seems to be the only shelter, it's obvious we will have to stay here.
You know what fat chance means? This is my hovel, so back out and let me sleep.
Very well.
Oh, for...
Huh? What?
What the...
Le voil?, le voil?.
Lady, you are making a powerful enemy.
Girls, let's get in.
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
A gentleman simply does not enter a room when ladies are not decent.
Well, you learn something every day.
I have to use the radio.
All right, Mr Eckland.
You may come in now.
Didn't you want to use the radio?
Er... Yes. Radio.
Ha. What's it doing over here?
Kings Point? This is Eckland.
Six Mitsu 104s heading east at 10,000.
- Message received, Mother Goose.
- Message received.
Are you looking for something, Mr Eckland?
I asked you to stop drinking, but you wouldn't.
- Oh, no. Where is it?
- Somewhere where you won't find it.
Gone again. Of all the meddlesome...
Oh. Come on.
Where is it? Have you got it up here?
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait!
Oh, you wait. You just wait!
Kings Point? This is Eckland again.
Hello, Mother Goose. This is Briar Patch.
- Get Houghton on the double.
- Big Bad Wolf is engaged.
I don't care if he's married. You get him.
You missed your calling. You want to carry a tambourine and put fig leaves on statues.
- What is it, Walter?
- Frank?
This is a military zone. You're in command.
Tell Goody Two Shoes to get off my back.
- Goody Two Shoes?
- Tell her she's a pain in the...
Uh! Please, Walter. Be civil.
Civil? Who pushed who out of whose home?
Who stole whose liquor?
Who bit whose hand? Twice.
- She bit you? Miss Freneau?
- No.
You tell her to give me back my booze.
You tell her to butt out. You tell her...
All right, Walter. I'll speak to her.
Here.
Yes?
Miss Freneau. I'm sure you've noticed Mr
Eckland is not the most sociable sportsman.
Mr Eckland is a rude, foul-mouthed, drunken, filthy beast.
Give me that.
This is the filthy beast speaking.
Listen. When you send those supplies, send plenty of whiskey.
I insist you do nothing of the kind,
Commander.
Now be quiet, both of you.
We've arranged for the parachute drop to take place tomorrow night at 2200.
I suggest therefore if you want anything at all, you give me a list of your needs.
- Whiskey!
- We know about you. What about the girls?
- Summer clothes.
- Peppermint drops.
- Glace au chocolat.
- Fraises du bois.
Girls, please.
- I have prepared a list.
- Now hold it.
You've taken over everything else, but the radio is still my responsibility.
Eight nighties.
Would you repeat that, Walter?
Mr Eckland isn't here any more,
Commander. I'll give you the list.
Eight nighties.
Nighties?
That is correct. In various sizes, starting with children's size 6.
And please make that one a bunny suit.
- A what?
- A bunny suit.
I'm sure you've seen them, Commander.
You know, with the hands and feet.
With the hands and feet.
Mother Goose?
Mr Eckland?
Big Bad Wolf is calling you on the wireless.
Oh. Don't touch anything.
In fact, you'd better get off the boat.
Oh, his shirt. And his pants too.
Good morning.
Er... I'm wanted on the radio.
- Er...
- Oh.
Hey, Kings Point? This is Eckland.
Come in, Mother Goose. This is Briar Patch.
Well, you had something to tell me.
Big Bad Wolf had a message for you concerning the parachute drop.
He gave it to Goody Two Shoes.
Oh. Er...
Commander Houghton couldn't wait.
He asked me to give you the message.
- Well?
- Well what?
- The message.
- What message?
The message message.
Oh, that message.
Oh, I wrote it down for you.
- That's in French.
- Oh, is it?
- Oh, so it is.
- Read it, please.
Commandant Houghton dit, il y a trop d'activit?s dans la r?gion...
No, no, no. No. You're reading it in French.
- Well, it's written in French.
- Oh...
Translate it.
Oh, you want it in English.
Um... Commander Houghton says there's too much enemy activity in the area to chance a...
How do you say in English "parachute"?
- Parachute.
- Really? Oh.
There's too much enemy activity in the area to chance a parachute drop and he asked us to make do with the supplies we have.
- Oh, no...
- Mr Eckland?
Er...
I don't suppose there's any use my asking your permission to share certain of your personal belongings with us?
So far, you've shared me out of my home, my bed, my food and my shirt.
- How about sharing my things with me?
- Would you like some tea?
- Tea?
- Lemon or milk?
- Milk?
- Sorry, we're out of milk.
- Oh...
- But we could use some place settings, some rope, some tools, and above all, a change of clothing.
Above all, I could use some whiskey.
Now how about making a trade?
Sorry. That I can't do.
Then, madam, I wish you a good day.
- Mr Eckland, wait!
- Hello, Mr Eckland.
- The answer is no.
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- Il fait beau aujourd'hui, ne c'est pas?
- I wouldn't think of it.
- Aah!
- You stepped on my foot.
You put it under mine.
- Look out.
- What a bunch of nuts.
Oh, now, hold it!
And what have you got there?
Oh! Oh, no! Oh...
- Come back here, you pirate!
- Mr Eckland, stop chasing the girls.
I'm not chasing them. They're all crooks, and you're the crookiest.
And a good day to you, Mr Eckland.
Rumplestiltskin? Rumplestiltskin?
Can anyone hear me?
I can hear you, Rumplestiltskin.
- I can hear you too.
- Where's Mr Eckland?
He's not here. Nobody's here except my friend Gretchen.
We're not well today. Say hello, Gretchen.
Did you hear Gretchen? She said hello.
Hello, Gretchen. I'm sorry you're not well today. Can you get Mr Eckland, please?
The Filthy Beast?
Oh, we don't speak to him.
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, get away from there.
- Come along, Gretchen.
- Is that you, Walter?
- No, it's Gretchen.
- Keep them away from that radio, will you?
You keep them away from the radio.
- Beat it.
- Miss Freneau told us to stay in the house.
Oh...
Ah!
After breakfast, may we go out with the others?
No. Not until you're feeling better.
It's Gretchen that's not well.
And I'm tired of staying here.
Oh, do stop complaining.
You sound like Anne.
- Is anything wrong?
- The whole Japanese navy's off shore,
- sending a boat. Where are the children?
- Oh, they're...
Come on, let's round them up, get them in the shack.
Mr Eckland, shouldn't we report the
Japanese to Commander Houghton?
In five minutes, he can talk to them personally.
You and Gretchen stay in the house.
Come on, hurry it up. Get in the house.
- Rentrez dans la maison et restez-y.
- Oui, mademoiselle.
- Quickly. Where are the other two?
- Collecting coconuts.
- I told you to keep them off the beach.
- You didn't.
- You weren't listening, as usual. Show me.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Show me where.
- Anne's up in one of those trees.
Uh-huh. Get down.
Stay here. Don't move.
Hey, stay. Ssshh.
If she opens her mouth, we've had it.
Jenny hasn't said a word since she left her parents. I thought you might have noticed.
She can still scream, can't she?
Here.
There you are.
Baby, ssshh. Baby, ssshh.
Don't cry. Ssshh. Ssshh.
Don't cry. Don't cry.
There.
- I wish I knew what they were saying.
- Ssshh.
The one with the glasses is the cook.
Their captain adores turtle soup.
Mmm?
He sent them ashore for turtles.
There doesn't seem to be any.
It's all right. They're going to leave now.
- Oh, dear.
- What?
One of them suggested they bring back coconuts instead.
It's a bad dream.
The cook says the captain wants turtle soup or nothing. He's sick of coconuts.
Good for him.
- Ooh!
- What?
He just called the captain a dirty name.
They are leaving.
Help. I'm slipping.
Oh!
Quick, let's go.
Go on, beat it. Buzz off.
You're not supposed to be on the boat.
Get off the boat.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What's your name?
You've got a name, haven't you?
See this whistle? Would you like to have it?
OK. All you have to do is repeat three simple words after me.
Is that a deal?
Just repeat three words.
All right. Elephant.
Elephant.
- Rhinoceros.
- Rhinoceros.
- Wrong.
- Why?
Not why. Wrong is the third word. You lose.
No! Give me that back!
I didn't think you'd be a sore loser. Here.
Fine.
- I'm sorry. We're all out of whistles.
- I told Harri she could help us.
- Help us do what?
- Fix your boat.
Harri knows everything about boats.
How would you like to swab down the deck?
Smashing. I'd love to.
Good. You'll find a mop down below.
Go ahead.
Oh, hello, hello.
Je peux vous aider? Je sais comment faire.
Mon p?re a un bateau.
Nous sommes souvent avec lui.
Er... Well, you do that. Do that.
But do it quietly.
- Mr Eckland?
- Quiet, quiet. Want me to mess this up?
Mr Eckland?
Now, I know you've saved up a lot to say, but would you mind spreading it out?
You're doing it wrong. It's backwards.
No, it isn't. See, the boat's upside down.
Do it this way so that when you turn it over, you...
How can I get anything done when you're chattering all the time?
Besides, you should be working. Come on.
It can't be.
Red light.
So this is where you are.
What are you all doing here?
- Look at their clothes.
- They're my clothes.
- But they're filthy.
- No, they're dirty. I'm filthy.
All of you get back to the house.
It's nearly time for your lessons.
- Mr Eckland asked us to help fix his boat.
- I'm sure he will excuse you now.
- But we want to stay here.
- I don't...
- What did you say, Jenny?
- We want to stay here.
Mr Eckland got her to speak.
I created a monster. A talking person.
Well, better do as she said. Get going.
Thank you, Mr Eckland. Next time I want them to talk or do anything, I'll call you.
It's not my fault boats are more fun than lessons.
I did it on purpose.
Nothing is ever your fault, Mr Eckland.
And if I return seven wild Indians to their families, that won't be your fault either.
- Sshh-sshh.
- Huh?
You don't have to be a schoolteacher all the time.
I am not a schoolteacher, but some form of discipline has to be maintained.
Ssshh.
Why don't you teach something useful?
What do you suggest?
Drinking and swearing?
Why are we whispering?
Oh!
I don't know. Why are we whispering?
Hmm?
- Is it edible?
- No, I get lonely.
Why don't you teach them something practical like catching fish?
Oh, well, that doesn't seem too difficult.
I mean, if you can do it,
I'm sure anyone can.
Try it. I haven't had my morning laugh yet.
All right.
Oh, that was good. Good.
Woo!
I didn't understand the reason for that last movement. Would you do it again?
I have an infuriating lack of talent for doing simple things.
You probably don't do 'em right. That's why.
All right, all right. Just stay there.
I like fish but fish don't like me.
All right, now. Be quiet. Just keep still.
Give me your hand.
Cup them, cup them. That's right.
Oh.
- OK?
- Mm-hm.
Watch what you're doing.
Here she comes again.
- How do you know it's a she?
- Her mouth is open. Now be quiet.
OK. Now... slowly.
Slowly, now.
Slowly.
S... S...
Mr Eckland?
Aren't we moving too slowly now?
Hmm? Hmm?
- Shouldn't we...
- Shouldn't we what?
- What?
- You said shouldn't we.
Shouldn't we what?
Well, you've got the hang of it now.
Oh... We didn't catch a fish.
I know, I know. That's right. We didn't.
- But you got the hang of it.
- You already said that.
Mr Eckland, are you going to show me how to catch a fish or aren't you?
I aren't.
- I wanna go back now.
- As soon as I've picked some berries.
- What if they're dangerous?
- Oh, we can always ask Mr Eckland.
If he says eat them, we'll know they're poisonous.
Oh... Oh!
- Something bit me.
- A snake, there, next to your leg.
- Woo!
- It bit you! It bit you!
Oh. Let's go back quickly.
Venez vite, venez vite.
C'est grand, vous savez.
On ne sait pas comment faire.
- What is it? I don't know what she's saying.
- It was a snake.
It bit mademoiselle on the leg.
OK. Everyone out.
Girls, do as Mr Eckland says. I'll be all right.
- I want to watch.
- Oh, Harri, please.
Come on.
- Is it painful?
- Your hand is wet.
Yeah. Now this is going to hurt a little.
- You should enjoy that.
- Quiet.
Go ahead, you can yell if you feel like it.
I don't feel like it.
OK, it's all gone.
- Do you really think it was poisonous?
- There's no sense taking any chances.
Lie back. This isn't going to hurt.
Mr Eckland. I want you to know
I really appreciate what you're doing.
Save it.
Come in, Kings Point. This is Eckland.
- Briar Patch, Mother Goose. Bo Peep here.
- Get Houghton. We've got trouble here.
- What's wrong, Walter?
- What kind of snakes have they got here?
Is that a rhetorical question, I hope?
No. Miss Freneau went and found one.
- Good grief. Is she?
- She seems all right at the moment.
Find out if they're poisonous and if so what we can do about it.
Right away. Oh, and Walter...
Until we get a positive ID, don't try and be a movie hero and suck out the venom.
Walter? Are you there, Walter?
- Yeah, I'm here, Frank. Shoot.
- Plug in the phones, will you?
Yeah.
- Go ahead.
- It's not good.
I've got Dr Bigrave here. He's checked with Tropical Medicine. I'll put him on.
Mr Eckland, there are three varieties of serpent indigenous to those islands and all are extremely poisonous.
Well, I opened the wound, Doctor.
I think I got all the venom out.
Taken orally, it can't hurt you, Mr Eckland, but if she were bitten and it entered her bloodstream, there's nothing we can do.
- Well, there must be something...
- The venom attacks the nervous system.
The end will come suddenly preceded by a general numbing sensation and dizziness.
- Oh. Oh, I see, Doctor.
- Do everything to make her comfortable, including the liberal use of any strong, analgesic sedative you might have.
- I don't have anything like that.
- Nonsense. You've used one for years.
No, I haven't. Oh, yes, I have. Yes.
Call me, Walter, when it's over. Goodbye.
Yeah.
- It's bad, isn't it?
- Where's the whiskey?
Oh, I knew it. I'm going to die and you're afraid I'll take the secret to my grave.
Whiskey is the thing for snakes.
Where is it, lady?
Stop calling me lady. It sounds so awful.
It's in the oven.
It can't be in the oven. I looked there.
I know you did. Gretchen told me.
I put it there after you looked.
Hey. I thought it was for me.
I just wanted to make sure it hadn't gone bad.
Here.
Now come on, drink that.
It won't hurt you. Go on.
Hey, hey. Be careful.
You'll ruin your amateur standing.
I'm French, Mr Eckland. My parents started me on wine with water when I was six.
But I don't believe in excessive drinking.
Especially in front of children.
No, the truth is, when my mother died,
I became the mistress of...
- the consulate.
- Oh, oh.
I presided over all the diplomatic dinners.
We had martinis before dinner, white wine with the fish.
Red wine with the main course, champagne with the dessert.
Cognac with the coffee and port after dinner.
Sounds great.
Isn't it getting hot in here?
Woo, isn't it getting hot in here?
Isn't it getting hot?
You mustn't move around. Come on. Just...
That's right. Just lie quietly.
I bet you think I'm an iceberg.
- Do you know how old I am?
- No.
The truth is, we've lived in 11 countries.
I can speak seven languages.
I'm excellent at bridge.
I play the cello very well.
I'm double-jointed, and I know how to ride a camel.
- I was engaged once.
- Huh?
His name was Cesare and he worked in the Italian consulate at Fiume.
- Do you know where Fiume is?
- Yugoslavia, isn't it?
No, it's in Yugoslavia.
He called me Carissima and gave me handkerchiefs with my initials on them.
Every time he wanted to kiss me, he'd say "Permesso", and then afterwards, he'd say "Grazie".
You've had enough.
Oh, Cesare would never have done to my leg what you did.
He probably couldn't reach it.
I liked what you did to my leg, the last part, I mean.
- Oh, that.
- Tell me. I'd like to know.
- What did my blood taste like, mm?
- Delicious. Now come on.
No, no, no, no. I'm being serious.
What did it taste like?
How would I know? I'm not a vampire.
Oh... Was it salty?
- A little salty, yes.
- Too salty?
- No, it was just right.
- Oh, no.
You thought it was too salty.
I can tell you didn't like it.
- No, no. I liked it.
- Oh, really?
- I liked it.
- You're not just saying that.
Great blood.
Please, now, buzz off, will you?
Miss Freneau isn't feeling very well.
Now come on.
I'm gonna kill that rotten snake.
Anne!
Your opinion of me is correct, you know.
I'm a... a picture straightener.
You're a what?
- A picture straightener.
- Oh.
When I see a picture on a wall that doesn't hang straightly,
I straighten it.
Oh, you do that.
And I brush my teeth every morning and every night.
And if I don't have a toothbrush...
- I use my finger.
- Mmm...
Oh.
- I feel so numb.
- Numb? Where?
Everywhere. What does it mean?
Oh. You'd better lie down.
And I'm so cold. Why am I so cold?
- Oh, I'm dizzy. I'm very dizzy.
- You lie down. Just rest.
- Oh...
- That's right.
Come closer so I can tell you something.
My coconut is empty.
Oh.
- Have a bit yourself.
- Oh... No, thanks.
There'll be plenty of time later.
I mean, you go ahead.
- What was she like?
- She? Who?
The lady who drove you to this.
Drove me to what?
Drink.
- Oh, there was no lady.
- That was your wife.
No. There was no wife.
Then from what are you running away from?
- Mmm?
- Oh, I'm not running away.
- Oh, there must have been some...
- Well, there was.
- A necktie.
- A what?
A necktie. I was late for class one morning.
I forgot my tie. They wouldn't let me in.
How long ago was that?
- About eight years ago.
- Weren't you old to be going to school?
Oh, I wasn't going. Well...
I was teaching.
- Oh!
- I was a professor of history.
And what about the necktie?
- This is no time to talk about me now.
- Why not?
Why not?
I thought they'd be more interested in what's inside a man's head, not what's on his neck.
- Mmm.
- Then I noticed they all wore ties.
They all looked alike, they all behaved alike, they all talked alike.
But they were all going the same way, no matter which way they said they were going.
So what was the use of teaching them history, or anything?
They weren't learning by it.
Still creating the same world problems.
So I packed, got on a boat and got away from them.
Oh...
Now look what they've got me doing.
Ah-ha... What's so funny?
You are the school teacher.
Oh, dear.
- What's that?
- The snake.
- But that's not a snake.
- It looks like a snake.
You ninny.
- You'd better tell Mr Eckland.
- I wanna go home.
- He'll be furious.
- Why?
Because Miss Freneau's not dead.
Oh I?!
This is Eckland. Is Houghton there?
I'm here, Walter.
Frank... It's all over, Frank. She's...
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
What do I do about the kids, Frank?
They don't know yet.
They'll have to be told, Walter.
Yeah. Stick around, will you?
I may need you later.
Sure, sure. I'll stand by.
- Mr Eckland?
- Oh, oh... Just a minute. I...
Er... Will you all come over here, please?
- Mr Eckland?
- Please.
- There's something I want to tell you.
- We want to tell you.
Just a minute. This isn't going to be easy.
Now, er...
Those of you who are old enough to understand what I'm going to say will be able to help the ones who... Well...
- Mr Eckland?
- Please, there's a good girl.
Now, Miss Freneau, who I guess we all gave a very difficult time to when she...
Well, Miss Freneau has... has gone away.
No, she hasn't. You tell him, Anne.
- Why me?
- Because it was all your fault.
Er... Just a minute. Tell me what?
It wasn't a snake. It was this.
- But that's not a snake.
- It looks like a snake.
Well, that's not a snake.
Here. Watch out for the thorns.
Uh! Thank you.
- Not a snake.
- It looks like a snake.
No, that doesn't.
This looks like a snake.
Is it morning already?
Walter? Are you there, Walter?
I have the chaplain. I thought it might be a comfort if he said a few words.
Never mind the chaplain, Frank.
She's alive. The snake's dead.
Walter, explain yourself.
Walter?
Walter?
WALTER!
Were you really a schoolteacher?
All of you raise your right hand.
Come on, raise your right hand.
All right. Now none of you heard anything
I said in there. You got that?
OK. Now spit.
Go ahead, spit.
The first one who breaks the pledge will get warts.
Qu'est que c'est, warts?
Er... Mr Eckland?
- May I speak with you, please?
- No.
You don't have to shout.
I don't even have to talk.
Um...
Mr Eckland, do I owe you an apology or an explanation or anything like that?
Probably. Some other time.
I seem to remember someone saying that a drop or two helps.
- No! Get away!
- Ooh!
I went through enough nonsense with you just to get this much.
Mr Eckland.
What exactly did I do yesterday?
Nothing. You just put a flower between your teeth and danced around the room naked.
I couldn't have! I did?
You mean you don't remember?
- No.
- Oh.
You don't remember anything I said, do you?
- Why? What did you say?
- Nothing.
Well, there doesn't seem to be much to remember then, does there?
No, no, no.
Unless you mean what you said about leaving civilisation because of a necktie.
I thought you said you didn't remember anything.
- Oh, nothing after that.
- There wasn't anything after that.
Then when did I dance around naked with a flower between my teeth?
- I told you those things in strict confidence.
- I haven't told anyone.
- You just told me, didn't you?
- You are the one who told me.
I only told you because I thought you were dying.
Sorry I disappointed you.
I don't mind that you were a schoolteacher.
There you go again!
Now it's none of your business.
I thought you were running away from something much worse than that.
I was escaping from hypocrites like you who have to get drunk before they can let go.
There. Well, then, you're a happy man.
- That's right.
- You drink so much because you're happy.
Yes.
- Is this boat tilted?
- No.
Now you listen to me. Before you mess around with others' lives, look at your own.
What's wrong with it?
Maybe if you stopped straightening pictures and let men wear their pants, maybe they could touch you without asking permesso.
- Dear Lord.
- It's Dominique's turn to say grace.
Mon Dieu, b?nissez nous ainsi que la nourriture que nous allons prendre.
Et donnez du pain? ceux qui n'en ont pas.
Amen.
Oh. Mr Eckland.
Oh, um...
I thought if you had enough food, I...
- Well, certainly.
- Look, he's combed his hair.
And he's actually wearing socks.
Well, you see, my feet were chilly.
Oh... um... we're delighted you could come.
Um, Anne, move over next to Elizabeth so Mr Eckland can sit down.
- I don't want to sit there.
- She never wants to do anything.
- That's not true. I wanna go home.
- All right. Change places with Harriet.
- Her name's Harri.
- Oh, sorry. Harri.
On the other side of Mr Eckland.
Thank you, Harri.
We fellows should stick together.
Pass to Monsieur Eckland.
That's my dinner.
Well, then, take it.
- I'm sick and tired of tinned beef.
- Then give it back.
I wanna go home.
Why can't we have fish once in a while?
Professor Eckland was giving me lessons, but he never finishes what he starts.
Raise your arms. Lower your head.
Drink something.
Give him something to drink. Quick.
- Drink.
- Hold it.
Jenny!
- Well, how strange!
- Why?
- That you bring me this.
- I've done it before.
- No, you haven't. Shut up.
- Yes, I have.
- Well, since it's here, I'll, er...
- There's already a beverage on the table.
- Yes? What?
- Coconut milk.
You're kidding.
Well, it happens to be very tasty and quite healthful.
Oh, I'm sure it is.
Ah-ah-ah. Mr Eckland?
Delicious. Coconut milk.
Young coconuts must love it.
Get back! Get back!
Come on. Let's get back in the shack.
I... I... I hurt my ankle when you... when I fell.
Get up. Let's see.
Put your weight on it.
It's not too bad.
All right.
That's fine.
This is Eckland. Get Houghton.
Stand by, Mother Goose.
- Yes, Walter. What is it?
- A plane, Frank. He dove at us.
- Go on.
- Go on where? He spotted us.
And now you'd like me to take you off the island.
- Naturally.
- Really. You never give up, do you?
- All right. Tell me what happened.
- I've told you. A Japanese plane flew over.
- What kind?
- I don't know.
That's what you're there for. Really, Walter.
Planes are supposed to fly over. We wouldn't need you if they didn't, would we?
Just because one gets a little close.
A little close? You listen to me, Frank.
Get us out of here by tonight.
I really don't think it'll be tonight, Walter.
Thanks a lot. I won't need you when I get the launch ready.
Walter, I'd forget about the launch if I were you.
You're completely ringed in there which means you can only travel by night in a boat which you can't be too sure of.
Even if you could break through, which I doubt,
Port Moresby's the only place open and that's 200 miles away.
- Then do something.
- Walter?
I have 32 men in precisely the same position you're in.
How is it I spend most of my time listening to you?
Now be a good chap and relax. Signing off.
The fathead.
I'll be down at the lodge.
Mr Eckland?
Mmm? Oh, I thought your ankle was bothering you.
- Oh, well, it's much better now, thank you.
- Fine.
I wanted to thank you. For saving my life,
I mean. I behaved quite stupidly.
- Can you forgive me?
- Sure.
I wouldn't want you to think badly of me.
Do you?
- No.
- I don't think badly of you either.
- Good for you.
- Mr Eckland?
You can kiss me if you want.
I may?
Oh, my darling. I have thought of nothing else since that moment we met.
This first burning kiss is but the beginning.
Tonight you will leave those children and come live with me on my boat.
What are you doing?
Of course, how thoughtless of me.
We must be careful.
What time can I expect you tonight?
But mademoiselle doesn't let us out at night.
Oh, well.
Mr Eckland, have you been listening to me?
How can I help it with you screaming in my ear?
Because you've been talking total nonsense as usual.
It's quite clear you know nothing whatsoever about children.
- You're an expert, of course.
- Well, I know one thing.
- Elizabeth is at that...
- Wait a minute. Hand me those pliers.
- Which ones?
- The small ones.
Thank you. Now what were you saying?
Elizabeth is at that difficult age and you frightened her.
Yeah, well, I'm at a difficult age myself.
She nearly scared me to death.
How about teaching them the facts of life, or aren't you up on the subject?
I wouldn't exactly call them backward, not the way they were watching during lunch.
Watching what?
It works.
Course it works.
Now what were they watching during lunch?
They were watching us.
- Watching us what?
- Watching us watch each other.
- So we watched each other. So what?
- Well, they're not blind, you know.
What do they think watching is, a proposal of marriage?
- Who said anything about...
- Because a man puts on socks for lunch?
If you think I'd want to get involved with an undisciplined, self-indulgent escapist like you...
Well, that's better than being a frustrated spinster who can't find a husband.
It's Matalava, sir.
Mother Goose is requesting a chaplain.
- Good heavens, he's killed her.
- No, sir. They want to get married.
Married? Goody Two Shoes and the Filthy Beast?
What's taking him so long? He's had time to get the Archbishop of Canterbury.
- Oh, Mr Eckland, really.
- Stop calling me that. It sounds ridiculous.
Walter? Are you ready, Walter?
Just a minute, Frank.
Here. Use my tie.
Oh, thank you, Harri, but ties don't suit Mr Eckland.
Well, have you got the chaplain, Frank?
Yes, he's here.
There's a little paperwork, Walter.
Bride's full name.
Catherine... Louise... Marie...
Ernestine Freneau.
Groom's full name.
Walter Christopher Eckland.
Witnesses. Who's the maid of honour?
Erm... Elizabeth Anderson.
And the best man?
- Harri MacGregor.
- Harri?
Just believe me.
Proceed, padre.
Thank you.
Now. Is everyone ready?
Yes, padre.
Dearly beloved. We are gathered here, and... there, in the presence of these witnesses to join together this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony which is an honourable estate, instituted of God.
Into this holy estate, these two persons come now to be joined...
Duck! Now! Quickly!
If there be any present...
Out! Everyone out! Quickly!
Come on! Get going! Stand under the trees!
Go on. Quick, before they make a turn.
...to make it known or ever after to hold his peace.
Anything there?
Good. Now, then.
Do you, Walter Christopher Eckland,
take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?
To love and to cherish...
...to have and to hold,
so long as you both shall live?
Er, Mr Eckland?
Do you, Walter Christopher Eckland...
- Walter!
- Stay there!
...to be your lawful wedded wife?
- Hold it, padre. Hold it.
- Mr Eckland, do you...
I do, I do! Get Houghton, quick.
- What is it, Walter?
- They came back. I told you they would.
- Who came back?
- You know who. Listen.
- Did you hear that?
- I'll get onto it right away. Stand by.
I want the name and position of every Allied submarine between here and Matalava.
- And get onto it right away.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Walter?
- I told you to stay where you were.
- The plane's gone.
I was afraid I was a widow before we were even married.
Er... Mr Eckland?
What should we do now?
Well, we'll take another whack at it if you will, padre.
- So take your time but hurry it up.
- Yes, yes, of course. I understand.
Let me see now.
Do you, Walter Christopher Eckland, take this woman...
- We did that part, padre.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm a little rattled. Let me see here.
All right, then. Do you, Catherine Louise
Marie Ernestine Freneau, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband, to love and to cherish, to have and to hold, for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
For as much as you have consented together in holy wedlock, and given and received a ring in token...
- Wait a minute. What ring?
- Didn't we do the ring?
- No, we didn't do the ring.
- We'll have to do the ring.
Hold it, padre.
- All right, padre. We did the ring.
- Oh, good.
For as much as you have consented in holy wedlock, and have given a ring in token of your troth,
I now declare you husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride, Mr Eckland.
Mr and Mrs Eckland, if you're finished now,
I suggest you get the hell out of there.
Yeah, that's a good suggestion, padre.
Thank you.
- Hold on, Walter.
- What, Frank?
One of your American submarines, the Sail Fin, is in your area.
She's submerged so we can't make radio contact with her until she surfaces tonight.
But she ought to be able to get through to you by dawn tomorrow.
She'll have to lie off the reef and await your signal, so I suggest you stay on the beach.
- Have you got that?
- I've got it.
Incidentally, Walter, congratulations to you and Mrs Eckland.
And the best of luck to all of you.
Mmm... And they're going to need it.
- Walter, are you awake?
- Uh?
I was thinking about yesterday.
Somehow the word "wedding" has always called to mind a different picture.
Somehow the words "wedding night" have always called to mind a different picture too.
Well, we couldn't very well have left the girls by themselves.
They're our responsibility.
They're not our children.
If they were our children, they'd have never gotten to be our children.
You won't come with us, will you?
- How did you know?
- When a woman is married this long, she knows what her husband's thinking.
Oh, well. I'll shove off and the rest of you can get to Port Moresby in no time.
- You know what Houghton said.
- I can't leave my boat.
- Must be a good one.
- It's all the dowry you're going to get.
I'm thinking of starting a charter service after the war.
Somewhere round the Solomons and New Hebrides. Good money there.
All right. I'm not leaving without you.
Oh, yes, you are. Someone's got to get those children back to their parents.
Lord, you're stubborn.
That's right. Come on.
There. Come on. That's it. Go to sleep.
- They're here.
- Hold it, hold it.
- Girls?
- Hold it.
- That's a Japanese patrol boat.
- Oh, my God...
They picked a fine time to check us out.
- What about the submarine?
- She won't surface while that's there.
Get off the beach.
- Come on, girls. Wake up.
- Quickly as you can. Wake up.
Take your gear.
They're sending two boats ashore. They're not looking for turtles, they want us.
- Can you radio the submarine?
- I can't make contact if they're submerged.
Take the kids to the launch and keep them quiet.
Here. Take these.
- Walter?
- Hmm?
I look awful in black.
Oh...
Over here.
- The house is on fire.
- I know. I started it.
When did you do that?
Last night when you were asleep.
What else was there to do?
Hey, hide all that stuff.
We're getting off this island.
- Is the submarine there?
- Better be.
- Are we going home?
- That's right.
I don't wanna go home.
Oh, come on.
Get in the dinghy and hurry it up.
Commander Houghton said there'd be a signal. He wasn't joking.
They're coming out to meet us on a launch.
- Dead slow.
- Dead slow, sir.
Answer's dead slow.
Holy cow!
Enemy patrol boat giving chase.
- Ready the bow torpedo tubes.
- Tubes forward. Make ready forward tubes.
Submerged reef 300 yards from shore.
No torpedo clearance.
The launch is heading out beyond the reef.
They're following.
That's what he's up to.
He's bringing them out to us.
They're plastering him.
They've cleared the reef.
They're right behind him.
Bearing?
Mark.
- Range?
Mark.
- Tubes 1 and 2 open outer doors.
Tubes 1 and 2 open outer doors.
Check fire.
The launch is veering into target path.
Get going. Get going.
Final bearing.
- Mark.
- Fire 1.
Fire 2.
On the nose.
Not that it'll do those poor devils any good.
Let's take her up and look for survivors.
Walter?
Mr Eckland?
Walter?
Oh, zut! What's the matter with this thing?
Mr Eckland?
- There's his hat.
- Jenny, move over. I want to catch it.
- Mrs Eckland, I presume.
- Mr Eckland!
Took me forever to tie the wheel off.
I thought I'd have to stay with her.
Our boat The Catherine. I'm sorry.
In the war, everybody loses something.
I'm just glad it was that Catherine.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wanna invite me in first?
Oh. Walter... Er... No.
Walter, you'll tip us in.
Not if you do it right.
Just shift your weight. Get over there.
Walter, I really don't think it's such a good idea.
Please. Just this once, will you do it my way?
All right.
- Shut up.
- I didn't say anything.
Looks like we'll be taking on passengers after all, Mr Cartwright.
- Break out a raft.
- Aye-aye, sir.
Ah... I wonder if they serve coconut milk on submarines.
[Wolf howling]
[Howling]
[Man]
* around the lonely campfire

[Man narrating]
Like everything else,
A good legend's got to have a good beginning.
The right bloodline, you might say.
This one began even before lobo's time...
With a wolf famous in his own right.
He was a big, rangy fella.
He used to roam a wide piece of the territory...
Back when it was still empty and mighty fine to look at.
Around the neighborhood, he was known as the fierce one.
In the local Spanish,
El feroz.
The vaqueros had a great deal of respect for him too.
Fact is, it amounted to a kind of a superstition.
Some of 'em claimin' he was a spirit wolf.
Well, this El feroz was lobo's father.
So for breed and blood, lobo came from a good line.
It was in the spring of '89 he was born,
A litter of five pups, two brothers and a couple of sisters.
That's about the usual family for wolves.
Now, these young 'uns are off to a good start on a number of counts.
For one thing, they were lucky just havin' El feroz for their dad.
It's a common thing in nature for the male animal to kill his offspring,
If he can get to 'em.
But the wolf's different.
He's about the best parent there is,
Because he's gentle with his young.
[Whimpering]
The wolf's loyal too.
Somethin' most folks don't realize is that wolves mate for life.
It's for all time.
The male and the female both being devoted to each other and the family.
For a real fine domestic arrangement,
There's probably not another one like it anywhere in nature.
At six weeks of age, lobo wasn't much of a legend,
Not yet anyway.
He was bright-eyed and full of mischief,
But he looked exactly like his brothers and sisters.
And at this stage of the game, nobody would have bet on him as a future king of the range.
About the only thing different maybe,
He was a little more curious than the rest of the litter.
He sort of liked to follow his nose,
Find out what is goin' on around the neighborhood.
But bein' a little new at this, he sometimes followed it too far.
[Yelps, whimpers]
Well, if you're gonna leave your common sense at home when you go travelin',
You're bound to land in trouble.
[Yelping]
Still, the school of hard knocks isn't a bad place to start an education,
And lobo caught on fast.
The truth was, all of his life, he'd be one to learn from experience...
And, what's more important, store it up and remember it.
By now it was plain that the pups were growin' fast...
And about ready for good red meat.
So El feroz checked over his boneyard to see what was left.
The bone he finally dug up was the last one.
Pretty slim pickin's for a hungry family.
[Growling]
About all it was good for was a tug-of-war.
There wasn't enough nourishment in this old soup bone to feed a canary.
[Growling]
El feroz knew it was time to go huntin' again.
* he'll feed his hungry young ones *
* El feroz searched for game *
* but there was not a scent of prey *
* throughout his wild domain
* across the endless wastelands *
* his lonely trail had led
* and then at last he spied them *
Pronghorn antelope, his favorite prey.
* his family would be fed
An antelope's faster than a jackrabbit on the takeoff,
But he can't keep it up forever.
The wolf, on the other hand, is a stayer.
He can hold the pace for hours on end when he wants to.
He can even outlast a good strong horse.
So this is how it was.
El feroz was countin' on one of the herd fallin' behind.
Sure enough, a big pronghorn buck pulled up winded and heavin',
Too tired to go another step.
Now the chase was over.
The rest would be easy,
Except that El feroz wasn't in a hurry to move in for the kill.
He began to work this antelope like a good cuttin' horse,
Headin' it back in the direction they had come.
This was an old, old trick.
If a wolf chased his prey Miles away from where he wanted it...
Say, a half day's journey from a hungry family...
He didn't end things too soon.
Instead, he'd send it along home under its own power.
Back at the den, these little young 'uns were bein' as patient as they could,
Exceptin' it wasn't natural for pups to be very patient when they were hungry.
They growled a little, grumbled a little,
Chewed on things and generally felt sorry for themselves.
If they'd only known it, they really had somethin' to complain about.
A cougar was pokin' around in their vicinity.
And if he found 'em, it could mean trouble.
Real bad trouble.
When one of these big cats was circulatin', nothin' was safe.
Stealthy, tricky,
He'd sneak up soft and silent, never betrayin' his presence,
Never givin' a warning either.
[Snarling]
[Growling]
[Cougar growling]
Seemed like right about now, the wolves had been dealt a losing hand.
[Growling]
Then at the last minute, a wild card turned up.
[Cougar growling]
There was somethin' about cougars that just naturally...
Brought out hatred in cowpunchers.
Of course, the big cats were death on horses and other livestock,
But the resentment seemed more than that almost.
It was kind of unreasoning, and it generally took the form of a rifle bullet.
Now, this went for wolves too.
And right at this moment, little lobo couldn't know how close he was...
To gettin' a lead slug of his own.
About that time, El feroz came home with part of his kill.
Right off, he knew somethin' was wrong.
It didn't take him long to unravel the mystery.
He could have figured it out by the scent alone...
And catchin' sight of the riders only confirmed his conclusions.
Humans had been here, and they'd probably be back.
It was time to pull up stakes and move on.
When the whereabouts of a wolf's den isn't secret anymore,
He'll find himself a new one,
'Cause the one thing he's got to have is privacy.
Of course, when that day comes, father just acts as guide.
It's mother who does all the totin' and carryin'.
All right, dear.
Get a move on.
Let's get goin'.
Since there was only room for one passenger at a time,
Each of the pups had to wait his turn,
But lobo wasn't in the mood for waitin'.
Like a stray on the tail end of the herd, he came taggin' along behind,
Doin' his best to keep up.
[Whimpering]
[Whimpering continues]
[Barks softly]
It was gettin' plainer every minute that he wasn't any Mountain goat.
But if he wanted it this way, his mother seemed willing to let him work it out.
He wasn't a quitter.
No, sir.
He stayed with it, and in the end, he came out on top.
Now, once on the trail, the parents moved along at a steady lope.
It was a little tough on the pups,
Bein' short coupled with short legs tryin' to keep up.
Now, there was no time for the sights,
No time to fool around with strangers.
Bein' the curious one, lobo stopped to say howdy.
The tortoise wasn't much on hospitality.
He just wanted to mind his own business.
Trouble was, he was gettin' a lot of unwanted help.
Finally figurin' to sidetrack his escort,
The old slowpoke veered off the trail.
The sashayin' was over, but the pup was a little late gettin' the point.
By now lobo had forgotten all about his parents.
It was sort of mutual.
Being concerned with house hunting, they had their minds on other things too.
The pup, meanwhile, had taken up with a new sidekick,
Another funny-looking critter in a suit of armor.
Seemed like everybody around here wore it.
Maybe this is what made 'em all so standoffish.
Well, in a matter of bein' friendly,
Lobo decided it was up to him to make the first move.
Now, an armadillo's got tender ears,
About the only thing on him that's unprotected.
Hurt his ears and you've hurt his feelings, for sure.
All this time the family had been coverin' more and more ground,
Gettin' farther and farther away,
And still they hadn't missed lobo.
So at a rather young age, he was left playin' lone wolf...
And findin' it a bit tedious.
He was hot, tired and thirsty.
[Whimpering]
To make matters worse, his feet hurt.
It kind of dawned on him along about this point...
That he was travelin' in circles.
He was lost, just about as lost as they come.
Purely by accident, he stumbled onto a catch basin of rainwater.
Just enough left for a quick drink and a soothing cooling bath...
For his achin' feet.
His wet tracks would have been easy to follow...
If anybody'd come along in time, but that wasn't likely.
The family was a couple of canyons away before they hauled up to count noses.
Now, wolves don't excite easy.
The fact that a pup was missin' didn't mean much.
They figured he was still bringin' up the rear as usual,
And he'd be along in his own good time.
In makin' his rounds,
El feroz had had his eye for quite a spell...
On a deserted badger hole.
With a little fixin', it'd do just fine for a den,
So he took possession.
[Animal snarling, feroz growling]
It appeared the place wasn't vacant, after all.
Tenant was livin' here,
And he wasn't figurin' to move.
Badger's a tough critter to handle, even for a wolf,
And this one wasn't gonna budge for anybody.
[Growling]
[Hissing]
[Badger growling]
He might be small, but he was fast on his feet...
And dead game.
Fact is, it turned out to be quite a dance.
Heel-and-toe and do-si-do all around the hall.
[Snarling]
Finally, El feroz decided to call it quits.
He wasn't gettin' anywhere in this game.
Besides, he had a lost pup to worry about,
And it was time he went lookin' for him.
The first move was to try to pick up his trail.
It would still be fresh enough to follow if the parents could find it,
But that was the big "if."
[Howling]
They tried callin' to him the old pack rallyin' cry,
Hopin' he'd hear it and know enough to answer it.
[Yipping, howling]
There wasn't even an echo, nothin' but silence.
One thing was certain.
They'd better catch up with him soon,
'Cause lobo was courtin' disaster.
[Rattling]
A rattler has a built-in warning system for those who know what it means.
But bein' a greenhorn, lobo didn't get the message.
[Rattling continues]
Sensing he was in danger, he began to call for help.
[Whimpering, howling]
Lucky for him, his parents were within earshot.
[Whimpering continues]
[Rattling continues]
It didn't take long to size up the situation.
They knew exactly what to do.
Draw the snake's attention to themselves.
If they could just keep the rattler busy,
The pup might slip out of the danger zone.
Trouble with this plan, the way out was squeezed a little narrow.
Besides, would the pup know when to come?
[Rattling continues]
From the sidelines, El feroz could see it was a standoff,
And he decided it needed a quick ending.
Once the rattler was rooted out, his play was over.
Now lobo could rejoin his family,
Sore-footed and tuckered out maybe,
But glad to be back where he belonged.
As the weeks went by, lobo branched out more and more on his own,
Traipsing around exploring the countryside.
One fine mornin', he was amblin' along...
Not doin' much of anything,
When he came upon a sight that stopped him in his tracks.
A young antelope was feelin' his oats.
He didn't seem to mind where he was goin'...
Just so long as he got there in a jiffy.
He was a kind of a crazy little cuss,
Rambunctious and full of the old vinegar.
To watch him knock this pup around,
You'd think he'd never heard of wolves eatin' antelopes.
Well, like as not at his age, he hadn't.
[Whimpering]
These two weren't old enough to know they were supposed to be enemies,
So an unusual friendship developed,
One of those things that sometimes happens in nature.
In the weeks that followed, they sort of grew up together.
And when they were three months old, they were still goin' around as pals.
Often as not, their trail led to their favorite hangout,
A little creek runnin' through the neighborhood.
It was a real inviting spot for a couple of dry country young 'uns.
And they didn't need to be told what a swimmin' hole was for.
Naturally, the pup favored the dog paddle.
The other fella's style wasn't as neat maybe,
But it got him where he was goin' just the same.
While all this was goin' on,
They were being spied on by a non-too-friendly raccoon.
She kind of took the attitude that water belonged to water critters...
And not to landlubbers like these.
The raccoon had a family to worry about, too,
And that tended to make her leery of strangers.
Nups are like that though.
The kids couldn't see anything wrong with the visitors.
If it was to be a swimmin' party, they'd join in right now.
Three of 'em would anyway.
The fourth one... well, it took him a little longer to make the plunge.
Whenever you get a passel of small fry together,
It's about the same in nature as with humans.
After a while, their animal energy is apt to bust out in a squabble.
[Growling]
[Screeching]
So the party ended, and wolf and antelope moved on.
Something else had ended too:
Their unusual friendship.
It's just not natural for enemies to prolong an acquaintance.
And as it had to be in such things,
These two came to the fork in the trail.
By the time he was six months old,
Lobo was ready to run with the family pack.
He was bigger now, heavier, more like his dad in every way.
Every way except one, he wasn't much help yet with the hunting.
To El feroz, meantime,
It seemed the hungrier his family got, the scarcer the game got.
More and more civilization was pushing into the parts,
Killing off his prey or crowdin' it out.
* it seemed to old El feroz *
* the trail herd that he saw
* was some new breed of buffalo *
* movin' through the draw
* again there would be plenty
* the wolves would have their fill *
* and so he brought his family *
* to join him in the kill
[Snarls]
Makin' a kill wasn't exactly easy though.
It was a tricky business, even downright dangerous.
If the timing was off, a wolf could get himself kicked senseless.
And if the set-to was a challenge for
El feroz, the old master,
It was somethin' more than that for his pups.
Just when lobo thought he had the thing down pat,
He found himself with a bull by the tail and afraid to let go.
What in blazes do ya do now?
[Calf bawling]
[Lobo growling]
About that time the calf had sense enough to join the rest of 'em.
And now it had protection that was gonna be hard to beat.
El feroz kept dancin' around, keepin' his eye on the calf.
For one thing, it was nearer his size,
And he was figurin' there might be a way to slicker the guards out of position.
Of course, he wasn't foolin' anybody really.
The steers were wise to him and quick to match his move.
[Moos]
[Moos]
[Growls]
[Mooing]
[Growls]
[Moos]
[Growling]
[Bawling]
[Growling continues]
- [Mooing]
- [Bawling]
There'd be another chance.
Put wolves and cattle together and sooner or later there will be a killin'.
When the buffalo were wiped out,
It left cattle as the wolves' only hope for survival.
So El feroz took what seemed his rightful share,
But the cattlemen weren't sharin' with anybody.
And from the very beginning, it was open warfare.
Along about that point, the cowboys got lucky.
The mother was knocked down.
She got right up and went on,
But she wasn't in any shape for a long grindin' chase now.
El feroz lagged back from time to time,
Encouragin' her, hopin' she'd catch up.
But he had the young ones to think of, too, and he had to go on.
The female was gettin' near the end of her rope.
A wounded animal knows when it's reached its limit.
And typical-like, she went off to find a resting place.
Maybe the riders would miss the turnoff...
And give her a much needed breathing spell.
But that's not the way it was to be.
[Gunshots]
* lobo, lobo
* remember this day
* man's bullets have taken
* your mother
* away
* lobo, lobo
* there's no lookin' back
* now you must abandon her
* run with the pack
Never again would lobo forget the smell of gunpowder.
He got to know rifles by sight,
And he wouldn't let man nor horse come within a thousand yards of him.
Yet all the time, he and the family pack kept takin' more and more cattle.
Before long, the cattlemen's battle seemed to be a losin' one.
The enemy was almost too smart.
Maybe it was a war calling for more than guns.
To catch a wolf in those days, the cowman had to learn to think like one.
The trick was to make him outsmart himself.
A wolf's an intelligent critter.
Fact is, there's not many to match him when it comes to figurin' things out.
So if a trap was gonna fool him, it had to be rigged up with some extra special trimmings.
A little dogie was about the most delectable come-on.
There was something about young veal that was well-nigh irresistible.
Once the decoy was staked out,
The next thing was to plant the trap where the wolf would have to pass.
The trap could be most any standard make.
It had to be strong though, like, say, a well-made number 4.
Not big as a bear trap maybe, but big enough...
And smooth workin' with a fast action.
Well, these preparations had been pretty thorough.
You might say they had a touch of genius about 'em,
'Cause next morning it looked like nature herself was in on the deal,
Playin' it on the cattlemen's side.
El feroz came on in the lead.
He was still headin' up the family pack.
And quick as a wink, he spotted the calf.
Naturally, he was tempted, and why not?
A free meal like this.
But before he made any move hasty-like, he sniffed around a bit just checkin' on things.
This all seemed a little too good to be true.
Might be that was what was wrong with it.
Maybe he'd better back off and size things up again.
[Snarling, growling]
Like an unexpected gunshot, the trap sent the young wolves a-scatterin'.
They ducked out of sight quick, all except lobo.
[Snarling, growling]
He sensed something wasn't right.
[Whimpering]
There wasn't much he could do for El feroz except lend him the comfort of his company.
Still, there's a kind of nobleness in the wolf.
In the unexplained way of the breed, he stayed by,
Prepared to keep watch to the end.
Then the riders came back.
Lobo knew he'd have to leave.
He had no choice.
For all wild animals, there comes the moment when they must go their own road.
And for lobo that moment was now.
* the time had come for lobo
* to make his way alone
* and loneliness and hunger
* were things he'd never known *
* all through the long, long winter *
* beneath the frozen sky
* lobo learned he must be strong *
* he must be wise or die
By the next spring, lobo had been a loner about long enough.
It was time to start lookin' for a mate,
And his wanderings took him far from his old haunts into new territory.
One fine morning he met up with some wolves he'd never seen before.
He was of a mind to join 'em.
According to pack law, he might be accepted and he might not.
It sort of depended on whether they wanted him.
As it worked out, they were kind of hankering for a new face too.
Right off, lobo was made welcome.
In the midst of all the jubilation,
He caught sight of a dark beauty on the sidelines,
And he knew his searching was over.
The black female seemed charmed with lobo too.
Before long, an old-fashioned courtship was underway.
Takin' himself a mate wasn't gonna be quite this simple though.
There was a kind of a catch to it.
The one who really had the say was the pack leader,
Surly old brute who right away took a dislikin'...
To the young fella from out of the hills.
The pack leader could see he wasn't winnin'.
And when you're not winnin', you might as well do your losin' the easiest way possible.
No sense gettin' yourself killed just for show.
He just tucked his tail between his legs and gave up, simple as that.
And so the lobo legend began to get a little bigger.
From that time on, lobo ran at the head of the pack...
With his mate at his heels...
And a following of the biggest, strongest wolves in the vicinity.
When the mating season came on, the pack split up for a while,
Each pair of wolves goin' off by itself.
Some of 'em had dens left over from last year.
But lobo and his mate, bein' new at this,
Had to set up housekeeping somewhere brand new.
One day in their scouting, they made a mighty interesting discovery.
Across the canyon was an old Indian cliff dwelling.
Looked like it would just about fill the bill.
Only drawback was, there didn't seem to be any way of gettin' over to it.
Well, where there's a will, there's generally a way.
And it turned out, there was a sort of a crossing.
It was one of those
"as the crow flies" things,
And a wolf wantin' to use it was gonna have to be mighty eager to get on the other side.
This didn't seem to bother lobo though.
After lookin' it over good, he undertook to give it a try.
The wolf's a surefooted critter with strong nerves and a steady eye,
And lobo had all the confidence of the breed.
His mate, meanwhile, hung back.
She wasn't near so sure of herself.
Bein' the female, maybe she wasn't so foolhardy.
Finally, after lobo had showed it could be done,
She got up nerve enough to follow him.
Once underway, it wasn't so bad.
Fact is, in time, these wolves would come to use this bridge practically every day.
It came to be a part of the lobo legend.
The cliff dwelling, when they got to it, looked real inviting.
The scent of man was long gone.
Besides, to these two, it wasn't a house but a cave...
With all the proper advantages of same.
Dry floor, sheltering walls and a good roof against the rain.
This was it, their new den.
The both of 'em were pleased with their find...
And, what's more important, with each other.
These two had mated for life,
And right about now the life ahead looked good.
The next few weeks were pleasant ones, and the days passed quickly.
Then the time came when lobo's mate didn't hunt with him anymore.
One morning when he got home from makin' his rounds, he found out why.
Sure was a handsome litter.
Lobo was as proud as a new daddy could be.
[Mooing]
* as leader of the wolf pack
* his fame began to spread
* for many hundred Miles around *
* a price was on his head
* by every law of nature
* the cattle were his prey
* but to the angry cattlemen
* it didn't work that way
* lobo

A thousand dollars, a darn sight more than most human outlaws were worth.
Lobo was a legend for sure,
The most notorious name in the whole southwest.
[Hounds baying]
One day a professional hunter from
Texas rode into the territory,
Hopin' to take the famous wolf that nobody else could catch.
Bounty hunting was his full-time trade,
And he came equipped for it.
He had a killer wolfhound so mean it had to be kept muzzled.
This was his hole card.
But first, a wolf had to be brought to bay.
And for this job, he had a pack of the finest trackin' hounds ever gathered together.
If anybody could bring in lobo, looked like this was the man.
[Hounds baying]
[Baying]
[Baying continues]
It didn't take the hunter long to see he'd been outsmarted.
This lobo was a lot wiser than he'd figured.
The truth was, he had a kind of a begrudging admiration...
For a wolf that could think up a strategy like this.
Well, if the dogs couldn't bring this fella in, there were other tricks to be tried.
In lookin' over the situation, he'd noticed somethin' important,
A clue about lobo's habits that just might prove his downfall.
[Jangling]
To anybody who could read the signs,
The giveaway was printed on the ground beside the log.
The wolf tracks here told their own story.
It was plain as anything...
The wolves always came off the log at this spot.
This was the place for a trap.
The hunter took a lot of care in settin' this one.
He picked an extra strong trap with a hair-trigger action.
Used a special trick to keep the dirt from cloggin' it.
Now it was just a matter of time.
It so happened lobo didn't make his usual rounds that day.
He'd stayed home with the family sort of takin' things easy.
His pups were about three months old now,
Gettin' more active every minute.
One of 'em was lobo's particular pride and joy,
The dark little female who was a dead ringer for her mother.
With a family to raise, lobo was apt to be watchin' his step pretty carefully.
The only thing was, this time the man who was out to get him...
Was the best in the business.
When the hunter came back, the trap was gone.
Just as he figured, lobo had come passin' by...
And had stepped down right where he thought he would.
The fact that he wasn't in sight was no cause for worry.
He couldn't have got far
'cause the trap was chained to a heavy drag.
It was leavin' a well-marked trail that would be no trouble at all to follow.
[Whinnying]
It was a wolf, all right, but the wrong one,
Lobo's mate, not the old outlaw himself.
Well, since exterminatin' was his business,
He might as well exterminate her on general principles.
Then a better idea hit him.
If it was lobo he wanted, maybe here was a golden opportunity.
Taken alive, this female was a sure way of gettin' at lobo.
When his mate didn't come home, lobo began to get restless.
He sensed somethin' was wrong.
It wasn't like her to stay away from her pups like this.
He set out to find her, just as the hunter reckoned he would.
At the other end of the bridge, lobo picked up the trail.
His nose told him his mate had been in trouble.
Mixed with her scent was another one, hated and bitter,
A taint in the air he wouldn't ever forget.
* the scent of man told lobo *
* that he must find his mate *
* but the bounty man was usin' her *
* to lure him to his fate
* the trail was plain to follow *
* he traveled hard and fast
* but he would have searched forever *
* to find his mate at last
* lobo
* lobo

* lobo
* there's danger below
* but true to your loyal code *
* there you must go

Lobo knew the chance he was takin',
The odds against him.
He came on, steppin' soft,
Followin' the fence for protection.
His mate was somewhere near.
His keen nose said so.
Then he found her.
[Whimpering]
She was alive.
Now his problem was how to get to her.
[Whimpers]
[Gunshot]
[Howling]

Well?
Zeus, king of the gods of the Greeks...
...write in the ashes so that I may read the future.
I see...
...a great tree at the end of the world.
And in its branches there hang the skull and the skin of a ram.
They gleam and shine...
...for it is a prize of the gods, a Golden Fleece.
We've no time for riddles and mysteries. Tell me of tonight.
Pelias, you will conquer tonight.
You will overthrow the kingdom of Thessaly.
You will kill the king, Aristo, and wear his crown.
You will do all these things without fear or wound...
...because Zeus commands it.
If I'm protected by Zeus,
I will have no need of this.
I will lay it on the fire as a thank offering to the gods.
Pelias...
...it is also foretold that although you will win the throne of Aristo...
...you will, when Zeus ordains, lose it...
...to one of Aristo's children.
- Then Aristo will have no children.
- He has three, Pelias.
Two daughters,
Philomela and Briseis...
...and a son, Jason.
Then two daughters and a son will die with their father tonight.
Hera, queen of gods, protect this child, my sister Philomela.
And if I, Briseis, am worthy...
...take me into your protection.
Are you Briseis, the daughter of Aristo?
Be silent. She is praying.
For her sister and for her murdered father, Aristo.
Are you a priestess?
I serve the gods.
Then tell me, has Briseis called upon the goddess Hera?
She has.
And has the goddess heard her prayer?
Yes.
Then pray for me.
It is the will of Zeus.
It is not the will of Zeus.
It is your will.
Zeus has given you a kingdom.
The rest will be your own doing.
The gods abandon you, Pelias.
A one-sandaled man shall come...
...and no god shall protect you from him.
A one-sandaled man?
The child who has escaped you:
Jason.
Then why was I not told the whole prophecy?
Why did Zeus drive me to kill this girl...
...when the only one I needed to kill was Jason?
Zeus cannot drive men to do what you have done.
Men drive themselves to do such things...
...that the gods may know them...
...and that men may understand themselves.
The killing of Jason would do you no good.
Kill Jason and you kill yourself.
Zeus, my godly husband, did you, for some reason...
...order the profanation of my temple in Thessaly?
That was entirely the thought of Pelias.
Not content with winning the throne of Thessaly, as I wished...
...he tried to avoid losing it as I have commanded.
I know that you've been insulted, my dear.
But be content.
The boy, Jason, has escaped.
- He will avenge you.
- How?
You must know by now I never arrange exact and precise details...
And because you are neither exact nor precise, a young girl was killed...
...and my temple was profaned.
- I want to help Jason.
- No.
You may help the infant, Philomela, if you wish. She's a girl.
The rest is man's work.
No. I want to help Jason.
As you wish.
How many times did Aristo's daughter
Briseis call upon you?
- By name?
- Five.
Well, then you can help her brother five times.
Five times only you can help him to overthrow Pelias.
And that is my final word.
It will be 20 years before Jason becomes a man.
Oh, an instant of time here on Mount Olympus...
...but a long 20 years for King Pelias.
He cautiously travels the roads of Thessaly.
Yes, Pelias, you have had years of watching and waiting...
...for the man who must come to kill you.
The man with one sandal.
I owe you my life.
That was as good a way to ford a river as any.
But I seem to have lost a sandal in doing it.
Where are you traveling?
To the palace of the king.
- Pelias?
- Pelias of Thessaly.
Then I can put you on your way.
But first, you must accept the hospitality of my camp.
Come.
Be seated.
You have not yet told me your name.
I am Jason, the lawful king of Thessaly.
One of my father's soldiers rescued me and brought me up in exile.
Now I've returned to claim my kingdom.
I have waited for you for 20 years.
And in that 20 years,
Pelias has turned my kingdom...
...from the pride of Greece to a savage, evil land.
I shall need your help.
When your father defended his throne, no man fought harder than I.
This time it will not be enough to fight.
I could fight.
I could find Pelias and kill him.
But the people need more than a leader.
They must believe the gods have not deserted them.
- They need a miracle.
- And where will you find this miracle?
I have heard there is a tree at the end of the world...
...with a fleece of gold hanging in its branches.
I have heard this too.
So have many men.
They say it is a gift of the gods.
It has the power to heal, bring peace and rid the land of plague and famine.
If I could find this prize and bring it home to Thessaly...
...then it would inspire the people, wipe out the years of misrule.
They would know the gods have not abandoned them.
My land would be rich and strong again...
...as it was before this tyrant, Pelias, murdered my father.
Jason...
...be advised by me.
First, search for this Golden Fleece.
Do not reveal yourself to Pelias, but build a ship...
...and find a crew, and when you have this prize...
...then and only then...
...return and kill Pelias.
And now rest yourself.
My companions are yours to command.
Father, why do you let him live?
If I destroy him, Acastus,
I destroy myself.
While he is searching for the Golden Fleece...
...he is at the ends of the earth and I am safe.
And if he finds it?
You will be there.
Have you come to pray to the gods, Jason?
If I had, I wouldn't have chosen a fallen one.
Only a statue.
Sometimes the gods argue amongst themselves.
Then great winds blow...
...and temples fall.
- Hermes.
- Yes?
No, I said the statue was the god Hermes.
- Hermes.
- Yes.
A bringer of dreams and a prowler of the night.
Jason.
No man can tell you how to find the fleece.
Is it not time you asked the gods?
They will not answer those who believe in them.
Why should they answer one who doesn't?
Come with me.
Why?
So that you will believe...
...and be answered.
You win, my lord.
That is, the battle, not the war.
Oh, those waters are far too shallow for galleys.
Hera, my dear, you really must learn to win without cheating.
Or at least to lose gracefully.
- Greetings, Hermes.
- Greetings, my lord Zeus.
There seems to be a piece missing.
Perhaps I can help.
Welcome to Olympus, Jason.
Jason come to Mount Olympus at last.
No man calls upon the gods unless he wants something.
We arranged for you to be brought here by Hermes.
I wouldn't have believed a mortal could ask the help of the gods...
...much less visit them.
Well, at least you're honest.
Which is more than I can say for most other mortals.
What is it you want?
A ship? A crew?
No. Those I can find myself.
And what are you going to use in place of gold?
The hearts of men.
I am Hera, queen of the gods and your protector on this voyage.
But my lord Zeus has decreed a limit to the number of times...
...I may help you when you call upon me. Do not speak now.
I know what you must ask of me.
Does the Golden Fleece exist?
And if so, where is it?
That's two questions.
And I shall help him with only one answer.
Search in the land of Colchis.
Then it does exist.
But Colchis...
That's the end of the world.
No Greek has ever sailed there.
Now that you've heard that...
...are you so sure that you will not need my help?
Think carefully.
I offered him a ship.
A ship and a crew.
And he refused me.
Refused the help of the gods?
What ship is strong enough to reach to the edge of the world?
What crew brave enough to sail in her?
I shall tell the shipbuilders of Greece...
...that the richest cargo in the world waits in Colchis.
The Golden Fleece is worth a kingdom.
I shall say that only the strongest ship ever built will survive the voyage.
The athletes of Greece are proud.
I'll tell them only the best can expect a place...
...in the most perilous voyage in history.
I shall announce a games...
...invite the strongest and bravest of the Greeks.
No greater games shall ever be held...
...unless the gods decree otherwise.
I did well to choose you, Jason.
The gods are best served by those who want their help least.
Welcome, Polydeuces.
Castor of Sparta.
Acastus of Thessaly.
Well done, Acastus.
Phalerus of Athens, champion archer of Greece.
Euphemus of Taenarum.
Spyros of Syracuse.
Hercules!
He's here!
I mean to sail with you, Jason. Tell me which champion you want me to beat.
No one. I know you can beat us all.
Your place is reserved.
Hercules. Yes.
- Hercules?
- Yes.
My name is Hylas.
Like you, I came too late to compete in the games.
But it occurs to me that if I can beat you at something...
...Jason couldn't refuse me a place on the ship either.
After all, he might need brains as well as brawn.
Shall we compete?
Discus?
Come on.
- See that rock?
- Yes.
No thrower has ever reached it.
And is the contest to hit it or pass it?
You'll be lucky if you get halfway.
- Now, go on.
- No, after you, Hercules.
I've never thrown a discus before.
I'd like to see how it's done.
Let Hylas have his moment of triumph while he may.
You shall have your place, Hylas.
Hail Hylas!
I have found the finest crew in all Greece.
Now for a ship that is worthy of them.
Argos.
- Argos.
- Hello?
Is that you, Argos?
- Who's there?
- It's Jason.
Come aboard.
So you've come back again.
She's a fine ship.
Yes.
She is a fine ship.
She's ready to sail.
We've yet to give her a name.
I'll call her the Argo, after her builder.
The Argo?
Well, you'd better have a look at the figurehead.
It might make you change your mind.
No, this way.
- Is it forward?
- No, it's astern.
We'll have to move it.
It's supposed to watch over the water ahead of the vessel.
I can't help that.
Something made me put it here.
Hera, queen of the gods.
- What?
- Nothing.
You don't object to it here?
- No.
- Nor do I.
It makes me feel someone friendly is watching over us.
- When do we sail?
- Tomorrow.
Don't waste it.
There isn't enough left to make any difference, Jason.
Oh, let him rest.
But the sooner we find some island with water, the better.
We can't row much longer on three sips a day.
Take my advice. Put back to Icos.
But we'd lose five days' sailing.
We haven't water enough for tomorrow...
...let alone the time it would take to reach Icos.
Don't worry, Hylas.
I don't expect him to take my advice.
But I wish he'd listen to someone.
Still grumbling?
Sailors always grumble.
These sailors have something to grumble about.
Hardly any water. Blistered hands.
- They should use brine.
- Brine?
It toughens the skin.
Well, go down and treat them.
I'll steer.
Hera.
You said you could help me a certain number of times.
So far, you've told me of Colchis.
And I threw Pelias from his horse and dragged him beneath the water.
Pelias?
So that was King Pelias.
I know your need.
Set sail and steer north.
- You will reach land at noon.
- Where?
The Isle of Bronze.
I've never heard of it.
No mortal has.
It was the foundry of the gods.
Hephaestus labored there, making armor and weapons for Zeus.
Oh, do not fear. Hephaestus himself has long departed.
I will see that you reach the Isle of Bronze.
But listen to me, Jason.
Listen very carefully.
- Take the helm.
- Yes, sir.
Set sail.
We reach land at noon.
Then you can fill your bellies until they grumble as much as your tongues.
Now, mark this.
It will be safe to take food and water.
But nothing else.
Absolutely nothing else.
That doesn't include women?
If there are any on the island, yes, it does.
If I meet a girl with a firm leg, a full bosom and a warm heart...
...let no man try and stop me.
- Talos will.
- Who's Talos?
You do mean there's a man there who wants a fight?
I spoke of no man.
Food and water, Hercules.
That's all.
Jason, who told you of this island?
The goddess Hera.
Port helm.
Steady as you go.
Furl the sail.
Ashore for food and water.
- Are goats good sailors?
- Goats? What are you talking about?
What do you want with goats onboard ship?
Well, some of us might be hungry...
...or thirsty.
Come on.
Here's one for the pot.
Hercules.
Isn't he one of the Titans?
He might be. He's big enough.
Didn't Jason say something about Talos?
This must be where Hephaestus molded the statues of the gods.
Yes. And set them up for all the world to see.
Hercules.
It's a treasure chamber.
The treasure chamber of the gods.
Look at this.
And this.
A pearl.
It's a javelin.
Don't be silly. In a jewel box?
It's a brooch pin.
Well, whatever it is, it'll make a useful weapon.
Let's get back to the ship.
- Hercules.
- Well, what is it?
- You'd better put it back.
- Why?
- Remember what Jason said?
- It won't be missed.
Anyway, if the gods leave all this lying about unguarded...
...they obviously don't want it.
Come on.
It must have been the wind.
And you saw nothing of them after that?
Perhaps Hercules found a woman after all.
Talos.
- Back water.
- Back. Back water.
Back.
I warned you, Jason.
This is Hercules' doing.
Talos will try to kill all of you.
How can I fight him?
Think before you waste the gift of the gods.
Against a man of bronze, our weapons are useless.
I repeat that question.
Then I must answer it.
Fight Talos with your wits rather than your courage.
And look to his ankles.
His ankles?
There is nothing else I can tell you.
Jason.
You disobeyed my order.
Lure him to these rocks, but stay out of reach.
- And what will you do?
- I shall hide here, Acastus.
I shall do my very best to send him to you, Jason.
My very best.
Mind his foot!
Quick, get back to the rocks.
Hylas.
Hercules, you've left your...
- Well?
- We searched, Argos.
And I will search again.
Hylas was with us.
We saw him running.
But then he disappeared.
He could've been hurt, not able to get back to the ship.
Like Palinuros.
We had to carry him aboard.
Hercules, Hylas is dead.
The gods decided it.
Why kill a boy for my grave fault?
But I should have stayed with him.
Search until nightfall.
We won't sail till then.
Sail when you please, Jason.
I cannot leave this island till I've found Hylas.
Jason.
Will you abandon Hercules, the best man among us?
- I, for one, won't sail without him.
- Nor shall I.
Nor I.
Come with me.
Hylas!
Is there any man here who does not obey the gods?
We will do as the goddess Hera commands, if she will speak to us.
This is your last chance, Jason.
The last time that I can help you.
I understand.
Then know this, Argonauts.
- Hylas is dead.
- Hylas is dead.
As for Hercules, he is not fated to go further with the Argo.
Zeus has other tasks for him.
And for us, Hera?
Sail to Phrygia.
Seek out Phineas, the blinded man.
Only he can guide you now.
We set sail.
Come on, back to your places.
Back to your places.
Get forward there.
Go away!
Devils! Demons!
Lord Zeus, I was a sinner.
I've never tried to deny it.
But I didn't sin every day.
Why, then, do you punish me every day?
What in the name of the gods are they?
Jason.
- Are you Phineas?
- Yes.
Take my arm. I can't see yours.
Don't flinch.
Zeus gave me the gift of prophecy, but I misused it...
...so I was blinded.
Zeus ordered the Harpies to torment me.
You, Jason, now listen to me.
The gods have ordered me to tell you whatever you want to know.
But the gods have gone too far with me.
They can punish a man so much, and then one day he abandons them.
He says, "All right, Zeus.
Throw a thunderbolt.
Let the earth swallow me.
I defy you."
You growl away all you like, Zeus.
I mean what I say. Jason.
I'll tell you what you want to know...
...only if you'll meet my price.
What is your price then?
Free me from these tormenting Harpies.
If Zeus sent those creatures to plague him...
...we'd be unwise to interfere.
That's my price.
Then we'll meet it, Phineas.
We'll make you the master of the Harpies.
Get to the ropes!
Now.
Castor. Phalerus.
Find some wood to build a cage.
Here you are, you hungry fellow.
A big fish for you and some more wine.
Well, Phineas, we've completed our part of the bargain.
- What is it you want to know?
- The way to Colchis.
The way to Colchis is through the Clashing Rocks.
Steer northwest and you'll reach them in five days.
Northwest, eh?
After the Clashing Rocks, you turn northeast.
Before long, you'll sight the shores of Colchis.
But tell me, what gods protect you?
None now.
Then you won't pass the Clashing Rocks.
- What are the Clashing Rocks?
- They speak for themselves, don't they?
All I can offer you is this.
It's not much reward for what you've done...
...but it's all I have.
If that's all you can tell us, then goodbye.
The gods be merciful to you.
Phineas, from now on, they'll witness a banquet every night...
...and eat the scraps you leave.
Good appetite.
There's not much water here.
Steady as you go. Row easy.
Easy, all.
Easy, all!
It's a narrow channel...
...but I can't see what made Phineas so frightened.
It looks calm enough.
Too calm.
Acastus!
I know the sea god's moods.
But most of them are dangerous.
Acastus, take a sounding.
The rest of you, be prepared to row when I give the word.
But an easy stroke.
Save your strength.
They may need it later.
Ship ahoy!
There she is.
She doesn't seem to be in any great difficulty.
A whole ship's crew.
And Lynceus from the masthead.
There was no hope of saving him, not in that sea.
Are we going through?
- Yes.
- But it's...
All right, we're going through.
Back to your places.
There's no turning back now.
No, Acastus.
There's no turning back on this voyage.
Drummer, beat out the stroke...
...but keep it easy.
The gods want their entertainment.
Jason goes too far.
Because he speaks the truth when the gods themselves go too far?
Turn back, Jason. We're trapped.
- Trapped, Hera.
- It seems so.
You've left me only one move.
Pray to the gods, Jason.
The gods of Greece are cruel.
In time, all men shall learn to do without them.
Pull! Pull!
Get back to your place.
Pull!
Pull till your hides crack and your backs break.
Pull!
Keep the stroke going.
Jason dared to speak of the end of the gods...
...and yet you let him live.
If I were to punish every blasphemy,
I'd soon lose all loyalty and respect.
You are the god of many men.
Yet when those men no longer believe in you...
...then you'll return to nothing.
You understand that, and yet you remain with me.
You think it weak of me, my lord?
Not weak.
Almost human.
Whichever god or goddess helped us...
...is to be thanked.
Those others weren't so fortunate.
What's that?
Who are you?
Your ship was lost.
We found only two other survivors.
They're being looked after.
Here. Drink this.
When did you sail from Colchis?
Dawn, this morning.
Dawn?
Then our journey is nearly over.
- Where have you come from?
- Thessaly.
But that's the other side of the world.
You don't look like a merchant.
Your vessel's a fighting ship.
We'd be foolish to sail unarmed.
By all accounts, your king, Aeetes, fears the gods...
...and we were sent by the gods.
But I'm gonna talk to him alone, peacefully.
Now you answer a question.
What was your ship doing in such dangerous waters?
We came to sacrifice to the gods of the rocks...
...to throw flowers onto the sea to make it safe for our ships.
I'm afraid our gods were angry, not so powerful as yours.
Are you a priestess?
I serve in the temple of Hecate.
A dancer.
Is Hecate the god of the Colchians?
The goddess.
But I'd heard they worship some strange idol...
...the skull and skin of a ram.
No ordinary ram.
Its fleece is of gold.
A gift of the gods themselves...
...and it's brought our city great peace and prosperity.
We'll put you ashore at dawn tomorrow.
Perhaps you will show me the way to the city.
Now, tell me your name.
Medea.
And you can answer my first question.
- Who are you?
- My name is Jason.
Within a few hours, we shall sight Colchis.
I'm coming in quietly by night.
Now the voyage is over,
I don't want the trouble to begin.
Won't be any trouble, Jason.
Just tell us where the city is and when we attack.
We don't attack.
But that's foolish. You have the finest fighting men in the world.
Forty fighting men against a nation?
Better 40 than one, Jason.
We're not pirates, Phalerus.
What's that girl done to you?
We thought you were a fighting man.
I'm going up alone in the morning to see what the situation is.
Oh, you mean spy out the land.
Well, why alone?
Why not take a few of us scouting?
The fewer who go, the less can get caught.
- What's the fewest you can think of?
- One, of course.
Right. I accept your advice.
But I don't.
Having sailed this far together, we're free to speak our minds.
And what's on yours, Acastus?
We nose our way upstream, rush the guards and seize the fleece.
We'd be out into the open sea while Aeetes is still asleep.
- A night attack?
- Yes.
And in the dark, during the attack, a man will die.
That man will be me.
A javelin in my back.
A Greek javelin, Acastus.
Maybe your javelin.
- You'll die for that, Jason.
- Keep back.
Euphemus.
It's Euphemus. He's dead.
Look at this. Slashed and bloody.
Acastus must be at the bottom of the sea.
I wonder.
- Make sail.
- And Euphemus?
The sea was his kingdom while he was alive.
Let it take his body now he's dead.
Make sail.
Make sail!
You're wounded.
We have a flower in Colchis which heals and soothes.
Tomorrow, I'll show you.
What do you call the flower?
It has no name.
It grows on a double stalk.
They say it sprang from the blood of Prometheus.
And it has been used over the years for its soothing and curing powers.
The sun's getting higher.
We must be on our way.
Follow the road to the east.
You're not coming further?
I go another way.
The goddess Hecate has spoken.
There will be one among us today...
...from the ends of the world.
His name is Jason.
Any man of whom he asks his way...
...shall say this:
"Aeetes, king of Colchis...
...awaits him in the temple of Hecate."
And that is all any man shall say to him.
Come forward, Jason.
You have done all of us a great service.
Tonight, we shall feast you.
We know of your great heroism, and it deserves celebration.
Return, then, to your companions and bring them to my palace.
I thank you, my lord...
...but I do not understand.
- Medea?
- Welcome to Colchis.
I give you Jason and the Argonauts.
Jason and the Argonauts!
Tell me, Jason, why did you come to Colchis?
In peace.
I said "why," not "how."
Altogether, how many men have you?
Enough.
And you say you do not threaten us?
Envoys who come to me in deceit remain in death.
I know you've come for the fleece.
I know, too, that if you cannot win it by bargaining, you plan to steal it.
But we'll never part with it, Jason.
It is a gift of the gods.
It has brought wealth and peace to Colchis.
Should we ever let it go, it would mean plague and famine...
...and the destruction of our country!
We can no longer welcome or entertain you...
...but treat you as you deserve.
As thieves...
...as pirates...
...as murderers.
We give our thanks to one person.
The person who exposed a criminal attempt on our kingdom:
The son of King Pelias of Thessaly...
...Acastus.
Hail!
Hecate, queen of darkness...
...you've always helped me.
Tell me now what I must do.
You, who gave me the gift of foresight...
...why didn't you reveal to me
Acastus' treachery?
He who sits drinking with Aeetes...
...while Jason...
...imprisoned, condemned to death.
If I help him now in the quest for the fleece...
...I shall be a traitor to my country...
...and to you, Hecate.
And if not...
...to myself.
Help me, Hecate.
Medea.
Why did you come here?
Was it Aeetes who sent you?
I came to ask you to give up your quest...
...and sail away with the Argonauts in peace.
Never return.
Never to think of the Golden Fleece?
Never to think of the fleece.
Then it was Aeetes.
You tell him I will fulfill the task the gods have sent me...
...and never betray the Argonauts, whatever he offers me.
Even if it's Medea, high priestess of Hecate.
Please...
...forget the Golden Fleece.
I fear for your safety.
If you're set on carrying it away...
...I must come with you.
I'll go alone.
No.
I have to go with you.
I have no country now.
And I love you.
Castor, Phalerus, Dmitrius, get to the door.
The rest of you, back to your places.
- The priestess.
- Argos, listen to Medea.
When you're clear of the palace, go to the ship and row downstream.
There's a break in the cliff and a path through the woods.
Anchor there. We'll join you.
Well, what is it?
- Jason has escaped.
- And his men?
They were all gone. I was making my rounds, found the guards drugged.
Drugged?
Then there's an accomplice.
- Where's Acastus?
- He's not in his quarters.
Acastus help Jason?
But there's no reason to it.
Unless it was Medea who mixed the drug.
The high priestess of Hecate?
I saw how Medea looked at Jason.
If Medea's helping them, then she's guiding them to the Golden Fleece...
...and the Argonauts will take ship.
The landward way is shorter.
Muster your men, captain.
Listen.
Soldiers.
Phalerus, Castor, you come with me.
- No, not you, Polydeuces.
- But, Argos...
You stay aboard with the rest of the men and guard the ship.
Jason.
Aeetes and the Colchians.
We heard them from the ship.
They must be somewhere near.
Get the fleece.
Guards, follow them up there and that way.
Wait.
Hecate, queen of darkness...
...revenge yourself against the Thessalians.
Deliver to me the children of the Hydra's teeth...
...the children of the night.
The teeth.
Fetch me the Hydra's teeth, quickly.
Against the children of the Hydra's teeth...
...there is no protection.
The fleece. Give me the fleece.
It has the power to heal.
It's true.
It does have the power to heal.
Jason!
Hold the guards back, captain, or they may die...
...killed with Jason and his pirates.
Rise up, you dead, slain of the Hydra.
Rise from your graves and avenge us.
Those who steal the Golden Fleece must die.
Argos, get down to the ship.
- Take Medea.
- Come with me.
There.
And there.
And still another.
Wait.
And more.
Destroy them!
Kill!
Kill, kill, kill them all!
Get back.
I think that proves at last that I'm a worthy opponent, my lord.
Where are you going?
- To clear the board. The game is over.
- It certainly is not.
For the moment let them enjoy a calm sea...
...a fresh breeze and each other.
The girl is pretty, and I was always sentimental.
But for Jason there are other adventures.
I have not yet finished with Jason.
Let us continue the game another day.
Will you stop your daydreaming,
Tommy Stubbins?
- Hello, Matt.
- Come and help me select a suitable dinner...
- for me clients here.
- Can I push the barrow?
Well, it's not gonna push itself now, is it?
It's against my religion to do anything violent till the end of the day.
God bless all Irishmen.
You know what I was thinking, Matt?
- No, what was that?
Not for you, me darling.
It'll make your fur fall out.
I was thinking that if you sold your fish barrow, and I sold my grandfather's watch, we could buy a boat and go to China.
Oh. Oh, you're the middle and two ends of a fine fellow, Tom.
It's a beautiful proposition, but don't you see the problem?
- What's that?
- Well, do you speak Chinese?
- No.
- Then, if you sell your grandfather's watch, and we go to China, how are you goin' to tell the time?
- I never thought of that.
- Ah, well, you see, you have to plan ahead.
It's very important.
I mean, the whole secret of my success with the fish barrow... was years of planning ahead.
Thank you, Charlie.
May the 17 holy men of Donnybrook reward you in heaven.
I'd sooner you rewarded me down here.
- Who's this then?
- Wild duck off the marshes.
- Is that a fact?
- Flew straight into the mast, cross-eyed fool.
Can you imagine that now?
He was probably under the influence.
He looks Irish to me.
Don't worry.
I'll fix him up.
Bring him back.
That's my dinner.
Now don't ask me to do that, Charlie.
As Secretary for the Preservation of Irish Ducks, it's more than me job is worth.
You never told me you were secretary of Irish ducks.
Oh, well, now I don't talk about it much.
- I'm a very modest fella.
- What are we going to do with it then?
Well, now, as soon as
I finish me deliveries, we'll take him over to John Dolittle.
- Here.
- Who's John Dolittle?
Eat hearty, me lovelies.
- And heaven bless all Catholic pussycats.
- Who is John Dolittle?
John Dolittle is the greatest animal doctor in the world today... and a close personal friend of Matthew Mugg.
He lives right here in Puddleby, he does.
- Out on the Oxenthorpe Road.
- What does he do?
He's a genius. That's what he does.
He can talk to animals.
- Talk to them?
- Speaks their language, he does.
Just like you and me's chatting now.
He'll have a word with that little fellow in wild duck talk... and put him straight in no time.
Oh, the darlin' man.
He'd think nothin' of travelin' halfway round the world to cure a sick sparrow.
Only last week, he went all the way to Africa.
Ask me why.
- Why?
- Why? I'll tell you.
To look after a crocodile with toothache.
He's altogether a marvelous man.
And he understands the Irish.
And any man who understands the Irish
Can't be reckoned altogether bad
The same way that the lunatic
Whose patron saint is Patrick
Can't be reckoned altogether mad
The doctor's very smart
He's an Irishman at heart
His favorite color
Sure it must be green
And also he's a man
Who'll blarney when he can
Let me explain the sort of thing I mean
My friend the doctor says the moon is made of apple pie
And once a month it's eaten by the sun
And that is why up in the sky
You'll find as every month goes by
Somebody in the sky is making another one
My friend the doctor says the sun is made of cheddar cheese
The doctor even knows the reason why
The facts are these
Try if you please
Pretending you're a lonely cheese
Wouldn't you want to try finding an apple pie
Of course you would.
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I love every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you?
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay
For my friend the doctor
And me
La, la, la, la
Here, Tom, catch!
My friend the doctor says the stars are made of lemon drops
The bigger ones are lollipops and ice  Come on!
The clouds have shops up on the top
That sells you sweets and soda pop
What do they call the place
-  Isn't it paradise
My friend the doctor says that every time it starts to rain
And people run indoors again in swarms
If you remain out in the rain
You'll think you're drinking pink champagne
And you'll spend your life praying for thunderstorms
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I love every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you?
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay for my friend the doctor
My friend the doctor and me
What was that?
- Ah, now, that's just some of his pets.
- Pets?
Polynesia, me lovely little darling.
Give us a kiss then. Here.
And, Chee-Chee, how are you, me old rascal?
I'd like you to meet one of me dearest friends. Master Thomas Stubbins.
Tom, this is Miss Polynesia.
How do you do, Master Stubbins?
How do you do, Miss Polynesia?
You wanna watch out for her, Tom.
She's 199 years old.
She can remember every single word that's been spoken to her... since the execution of Charles I in 1648.
- Isn't that right, Polynesia?
- No, Matthew, 'twas 1649.
'Twas a Tuesday.
Oh, yeah, right.
You see what I mean?
And this is Chee-Chee.
- How do you do, Chee-Chee?
- Where's the good doctor?
- He's working in the library.
Show them in, Chee-Chee.
I know he's in there.
Good heavens, Matthew.
Oh, I'm terrible sorry. I must have frightened them out of their lives.
Matthew, you're soaking wet.
You're a little on the damp side yourself, sir.
Oh, it's these fish languages.
They really only work underwater.
It's fascinating.
The basic system is mouth movements and bubble signals.
At the moment,
I can only make big bubbles, and they keep telling me I'm shouting.
Beggin' me ignorance, sir, but what can you hope to get out of a conversation with a goldfish?
Matthew, I'll show you.
The legendary great pink sea snail.
For hundreds of years, sailors have claimed that they've seen it.
Oh, poor devils.
It's that rotten stock they drink.
But, uh, what has this got to do with goldfish?
I don't believe it's legendary.
I believe it actually exists.
What's that got to do with goldfish?
Well, I'm planning a voyage to find it.
That is, if I can get enough money together.
Oh, may the saints reward you, sir.
But, uh, what's that got to do with the...
Well, if I find it, Matthew,
I'm going to want to talk to it.
Therefore, I have to acquire a knowledge of ancient shellfish, which is extremely complicated.
So, I'm starting with basic fish languages, like halibut, mackerel and goldfish.
Ah, there, you see? I knew it had something to do with goldfish.
Now, about your last voyage, Doctor.
Did, uh, did you find the crocodile with a toothache?
Crocodile?
Oh, yes, in the Congo, yes.
I got back on Saturday.
- Look.
- Isn't that a beauty now?
Make a marvelous bottle opener.
Look at that, Tom.
Oh, forgive me, Doctor.
- This is me ol' pal, Tommy Stubbins.
- How do you do, sir?
- He's brought a patient for you.
- It's a duck, sir.
- It's a drake.
You're sopping wet too.
- Yes, sir, it's raining.
He's hurt his wing, sir.
- Yes, so he's been telling me.
Oh, quack, quack.
Oh, poor chap, yes.
Sorry.
Quack, quack.
He had a row with his wife and wasn't looking where he was going.
He told you all that?
They're very neurotic creatures.
You'll be all right by the morning.
Yes, I'll get word to your wife.
Quack, quack, quack.
Now, while our friend's convalescing,
I'll try and find you something dry to wear.
Then, we all can have some food together.
- Polynesia, two more for dinner.
- Yes, Doctor.
Oh, and, Matthew, hold on to that crocodile's tooth.
Must be a bottle somewhere you can open with it.
Gub-Gub.
Will you please stop making that infernal noise?
A few pork sausages and a bit of bacon.
The way you're carrying on, you'd think we were cooking your entire family.
Chee-Chee, make him behave.
But you can hardly blame him for being a bit upset, Doctor.
I'd be upset meself if you started frying Irishmen.
You know the problem as well as I do, Matthew.
I've nearly 600 mouths to feed, including the mice.
- Six hundred!
- Yes. So if the butcher... gives me a string of sausages now and then, I take it, whether it upsets Gub-Gub or not.
Anyway, he eats more than any of us.
Sure you won't be having anything?
- Quite sure. Thank you, Matthew.
- Aren't you hungry, Doctor?
Yes, but I follow a very special diet, Stubbins.
- It's highly nutritious and very good.
- Oh, I see.
The doctor's in rather an awkward position, you see, Tom.
- Aren't you, Doctor?
- What do you mean, Matt?
You understand, Stubbins, he means meat.
It upsets the animals if I, uh...
- Oh, of course.
- So I don't.
As a matter of principle, one should always try to avoid eating one's friends.
The day that I became a veterinarian
I had a sudden overwhelming wish
To be a pure and simple vegetarian
And give up eating all that meat and fish
- I think that's marvelous.
- Meat is very unhealthy for you.
So now I live on healthy food instead
Like apple cores and parsnip juice
And chunks of plain brown bread
All right, all right.
I'm coming.
When I see my fellowman consuming sirloin steak
And I find myself enjoying tea and Dundee cake
There is really only one conclusion I can make
I'm a devoted vegetarian
No, no, no, no, you've had yours.
When my host at dinner offers succulent roast beef
Proudly I refuse it
People stare in disbelief
Lost in admiration as I nibble on a leaf
A very noted vegetarian
I wouldn't even eat horseradish, in case I upset the horses.
I stay away from deviled ham on principle
I wouldn't eat roast duckling if I could
Willpower has made me invincible
My word
Those sausages look good
Where's my dinner gone?
They've done it again.
Come on. Own up. Who's got it this time? Who's got my dinner?
It's bad enough to have to eat this muck in the first place.
Just 'cause I eat this instead of eating them, they think they can take advantage of me.
You've no idea what I put up with on their account.
I eat every flowering shrub there is except for gorse
Sometimes I get luxuries like beetroot leaves, of course
My life's much the same as that of any English horse
Why should I be a vegetarian
Turnip pie and peanuts
That's the sort of filth I eat
Any sort of rubbish that is wholesome and discreet
Why don't I admit that my hypocrisy's complete
If I should live to be a centenarian
Become our most adored humanitarian
I'll never make a decent vegetarian
I'm a cheat, I love meat
I'm a cheat, yes, I am
I love red-blooded juicy chunks of meat
Legs of lamb, sides of beef
And chops and steaks and veal and pork, of course
-  My favorite meal
And then I hear poor Gub-Gub squeal
Oh, me, oh, my
A reluctant but sincere
Vegetarian
Am I
So, you see, Stubbins, being an animal doctor has its problems.
For one thing, you don't get paid anything, at least not in money.
You get bones or nuts or worms... or whatever the particular animal's currency happens to be.
And secondly, most of the animals who come here as patients like it so much, they stay here permanently.
It's hardly what you'd call a profit-making enterprise.
But who looks after the animals?
They look after themselves, for the most part.
Animals are much better at that than human beings.
And how did you become a veteran?
No, Stubbins, the word is "veterinarian."
But say "animal doctor."
It's less pretentious.
It all happened rather suddenly, actually.
My entire life changed in one day, didn't it, Matthew?
It was my sister, Sarah, who started it all.
Sarah.
Oh!
Did you know that an ant has more intelligence than a hippopotamus?
And that a grasshopper... in relation to his size... has more power in his hind legs than a kangaroo?
Absolutely fascinating.
There's no doubt about it. Animals are much more interesting than people.
Good heavens, Sarah.
What on Earth are you doing down there?
There are pigeons in the linen cupboard.
- Oh, yes, I thought it would be warmer for them.
- You knew?
Yes, I put them there. It gets so terribly chilly on the roof at night.
And two tortoises in the guest room.
That's where they are.
I wondered where they got to.
- And white mice in your chest of drawers.
- That's right.
And the grass snakes are in the roll top desk under the envelopes.
Grass snakes?
John Dolittle, if those animals aren't out of this house by tonight...
Oh, dear!
Nine o'clock precisely.
That will be Lady Petherington.
I wonder what she's found wrong with herself today.
All right, Sarah.
Show her in, please.
I mean it, John.
I shall leave.
Those animals, they're destroying your practice.
You won't have a decent patient left soon.
Not unless you answer the door.
I don't understand the things that go on around this house with those animals.
And we'll probably never see the vicar's wife again... after giving her that glass of milk with a frog in it.
I really don't know what you expect me to do.
Oh, good morning,
Lady Petherington.
Are we feeling better today?
We're no better for being left to freeze to death on Doctor's front doorsteps.
Oh.
Dr. Dolittle, oh, it's my nerves.
You must do something for them instantly.
Oh, you'll never guess what happened.
It's quite the worst experience of my life.
Uh, won't you come in,
Lady Petherington?
I was giving this dinner party last night... up at the Grange for the Duke of St. Albans.
Fifty guests. The most embarrassing moment of my entire life.
A mouse ran across the table.
Oh, I thought I'd die.
I may still.
Can you imagine? A mouse.
Do you know who was there, hmm?
Well, of course, everybody.
The humiliation.
Crown Prince Angelicus of Brandenberg.
He's so well-bred, he doesn't even know what a mouse is.
Fainted dead away.
I haven't slept all night.
Of course, I discharged my entire staff, especially the gardeners.
I'll be struck from the social directory.
A mouse. Hmph.
- Vicar, what a surprise!
- Bless me.
How is your frog?
I mean, your wife.
Oh, the less said about her the better.
I mean, that incident.
Most unfor... for... for... fortunate.
Bless me.
Miss Dolittle, it's my hay fever.
The Bishop of Glastonbury is attending my sermon this evening,
- and it's most important, you understand.
- Of course.
- But my hay... hay...
Oh! Oh! Oh!
But... But... Oh!
- Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!
Where in the heavens does that woman think she's going?
- Get out of my way, Vicar!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh!
Oh!
Ow!
Oh, let me out of this madhouse!
- Oh! Oh!
- Sir Rupert, I'm so sorry!
Ow!
John!
Yes, Sarah?
I shall give you just five minutes to make up your mind.
Either you get rid of every hideous bird, beast and reptile... in this ridiculous menagerie immediately,
- or I am leaving... today!
- But...
- Five minutes.
- Sarah, I can't just...
Oh, yes, you can just.
I don't think five minutes is very long.
Anybody home?
Oh, come in, Matthew.
Well, l-I didn't know you was having a party.
What are we celebrating?
You know, Matthew, today I made a great discovery.
Oh? What was that then?
I'm a terrible doctor.
I'm probably the worst doctor in the world.
Good for you.
I like a man who knows his worth.
I have absolutely no interest in the health and welfare of my patients.
I can't begin to communicate with them.
I don't even want to communicate with them.
I've come to the conclusion that, with the possible exception of yourself,
I have nothing in common with the human race.
You know, the trouble with you,
John Dolittle, is you prefer animals to people.
But animals are so much more fun than people.
Then be an animal doctor.
- What was that?
- I said, "Be an animal doctor."
Animal doctor?
You know more about animals than anybody I've ever met.
I could get every sick animal within miles to come to you.
Aye, so could I.
At least all the dogs and cats.
All the rich ones, that is.
The Pekes and the poodles.
I could slip a little something into their meat.
Shh, Matthew.
What do you mean?
I mean, there isn't one good animal doctor in the west of England.
Farmer Green's cow was saying only the other day... she just will not have another calf until she gets a decent doctor.
You mean, you spoke to her?
At the Animals' Welfare League.
We meet every Wednesday.
She's chair-cow.
You mean, animals actually talk to one another?
Well, of course, we can.
Do you think we're all dumb?
L... No, no.
I knew parrots could talk.
Parrots are the finest linguists in the animal kingdom.
I speak over 2,000 languages, including dodo and unicorn.
- Unicorn?
- I have a classical education.
Polynesia, could I learn to talk to animals?
I don't see why not.
You're quite intelligent.
Oh, thank you.
If I succeeded, I could become... the greatest animal doctor in the world.
Oh, no question.
Mind you, it isn't easy.
I'm the only parrot in the world... who actually understands what she's talking about.
Well, if you can do it,
I don't see why I shouldn't.
I like your attitude.
Why have I never thought of this before?
Polynesia, I want you to teach me everything you know.
What, 2,000 languages?
Certainly. We'll start at 8:00 tomorrow morning.
But it took me over a hundred years.
Then we'll start at 7:00.
There's not a moment to lose.
Matthew, think what it would mean...
If I could talk to the animals
Just imagine it
Chatting to a chimp in chimpanzee
Imagine talking to a tiger
Chatting to a cheetah
What a neat achievement that would be
If we could talk to the animals
Learn their languages
Maybe take an animal degree
I'd study elephant and eagle buffalo and beagle
Alligator, guinea pig and flea
I would converse in polar bear and python
And I would curse in fluent kangaroo
If people asked me
Can you speak rhinoceros
I'd say, of course-eros
Can't you
If I conferred with our furry friends
Man-to-animal
Think of the amazing repartee
If I could walk with the animals
Talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they could talk to me
If I consulted with quadrupeds
Think what fun we'd have
Asking over crocodiles for tea
Or maybe lunch with two or three lions
Walruses or sea lions
What a lovely place the world would be
If I spoke slang to orangutans
The advantages any fool on Earth could plainly see
Discussing Eastern art and dramas
With intellectual llamas
That's a big step forward
You'll agree
I'd learn to speak in antelope and turtle
My Pekingese would be extremely good
If I were asked to sing in hippopotamus
I'd say, why not-amus and would
If I could parley with pachyderms
It's a fairy tale worthy of Hans Andersen or Grimm
A man who walks with the animals
Talks with the animals
Grunts and squeaks and squawks with the animals
This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me, Polynesia.
I can't wait to start.
Just the very thing.
For instance, Polynesia, how would I say...
"good morning" to our friend there?
In pig talk, I mean.
That's simple.
- Was that it?
- Why, yes.
It's remarkable.
What was all the leg-shaking business?
That's part of "good morning."
Most animal languages are a mixture of sounds and movements.
A short snort means "good."
Shaking the leg means "morning."
And you... And you just put the two together?
That's right.
Didn't answer me.
No, that's your right leg.
That means "good night."
Oh.
She answered.
Did you see that? She answered.
All I went was...
Did it again.
Good heavens. I speak pig.
Where are we going?
I want to say good morning to every animal in Puddleby.
It's incredible.
It's impossible.
But it's true.
A man can talk to the animals
It's a miracle
In a year from now I guarantee
I'll be the marvel of the mammals
Playing chess with camels
No more just a boring old M.D.
I'll study every living creature's language
So I can speak to all of them on sight
If friends say
Can he talk in crab or pelican
You'll say, like helican and you'll be right
And if you just stop to think a bit
There's no doubt of it
I shall win a place in history
For I can walk with the animals
Talk with the animals
Grunt and squeak and squawk with the animals
And they can squeak and squawk
And speak and talk
To me
Needless to say, Stubbins,
I've neither seen nor spoken... to dear sister, Sarah, from that day to this.
But I do have the consolation of being able to speak 498 animal languages.
Any one of which is more fun than talking to Sarah.
Four hundred and ninety-eight?
With goldfish, it will be 499.
When you get to 500, Doctor, we ought to have a party.
We must.
You'll need more than languages before we can search for the great pink sea snail.
Voyages cost money, you know.
Mm, quite.
Now, gentlemen, if you'll forgive me, animals are earlier risers than human beings, and I've got to be up at 5:30 to open the clinic.
Good heavens.
You can't go home in that.
Matthew, you can make up a bed here, if you don't mind Gub-Gub snoring.
Stubbins can sleep on the sofa in the library.
Polynesia will go over to your house and tell your parents you're all right.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
He's a genius.
Uh-hum.
I think you're next.
What did you tell her?
To take two of these pills three times a day after meals.
Polynesia, remember that lady owes us a gallon of milk.
- All right, Doctor.
- Now, what next?
This mouse. He has a bent tail.
Oh, it's you again.
Well, that's the third time this week.
What's that machine?
It's a whisker and tail straightener.
My own invention.
These field mice are always getting caught in General Bellowes' pantry... up at the Grange.
Being a military man, he has a regular defense system of mousetraps, and they're all having very narrow escapes, like this one.
There we are.
That should do it. Good as new.
There.
But, uh, keep away from General Bellowes' pantry.
Next.
Good morning, Sheila.
On the desk, please, Stubbins.
Yes, sir.
- Oh, I see.
- What's the matter?
Apparently one of her children have got flat feet.
This one? Yes.
Very dangerous in hunting season.
Can't run fast enough.
I'll work out some form of exercise.
Bum-bum. Bum-bum.
Bum-bum. Something like that.
Anyhow, we'd better see our other patients first.
I can get on with this later.
Good boy, Jip.
Uh-oh.
Ah, Toggle.
Oh, yes, of course.
Toggle's getting a bit shortsighted in his old age.
There now.
We'll just, uh, test these.
Now, I'm sure this will be better than the last time.
Good Lord. That's excellent.
Polynesia, remember
Toggle owes me a free ride... next time I have to go to Plymouth or Penzance.
Yes, Doctor.
What the devil! Emma, I'll murder him if I lay my hands on him!
- That's Bellowes' voice.
- Damn it! What's the matter?
Out of my way!
Out of my way!
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
There he is.
We've caught him red-handed.
- Emma, you're a witness.
- A witness to what?
The most flagrant display of organized animal stealing... in the history of Puddleby crime.
Organized? I beg...
I am a doctor, sir.
You are a horse thief, sir.
That is my plow horse.
It's no good your trying to disguise him.
He's wearing glasses because he's shortsighted.
I'd recognize him anywhere.
Take them off. At once, sir.
Shortsighted. That won't sound very convincing in front of the magistrate.
- Magistrate?
- I'm prosecuting, and I don't fancy your chances in court.
I'm the magistrate, and if I weren't late for my foxhunt,
I'd report you for cruelty to animals.
Don't you dare lay a finger on her.
- She's one of my patients.
- One of your what?
She's been chased by your wretched foxhounds three times in two weeks.
You've already murdered her husband.
If anything happened to her, these babies are going to be orphans.
It's all right, Sheila.
I won't let him hurt you.
I've never heard... Sheila?
Just the sight of you is enough to give her a heart attack.
Look at her.
She's a complete nervous wreck.
She'll be more than that by the time I'm finished with her!
- You'll never catch her.
- Tallyho!
There are times when the English are rather tiresome.
Bellowes, no!
Out of my way!
- Out of my way! Out of my way!
- Oh, well.
"Never catch her," eh?
What do you think this is?
My horse!
- Where did they come from?
- North America.
We formed an Anglo-American
Fox Protection Society.
Purely volunteer, of course.
Fox Protection Society?
Yes. During the hunting season, a skunk will always run with a fox.
The idea is to put the hounds off the scent.
I never dreamt it would work so well.
- How dare you!
- I beg your pardon?
- General Bellowes...
- He certainly does.
- Is my uncle.
- I'm sorry.
- Is that an apology?
- I'm sorry he's your uncle.
And I'm sorry I'm his niece.
- It must be terrible.
- What do you mean?
Having a name like Bellowes.
- My name is Emma Fairfax.
- Oh, that's a bit better.
What I meant was that if I were his nephew instead of his niece...
If you were his nephew, you'd hardly be called Emma Fairfax.
- If I were a man...
- Fred Fairfax?
I have never in my entire experience... known anyone treat people as appallingly as you do.
I don't treat people, madam.
I treat animals.
You treat people like animals too.
And I have nothing but contempt for people whose idea of pleasure... is to take a defenseless animal and make a social event out of a ritual killing.
- That's it, John Dolittle. You tell her.
- Matthew, I am telling her.
- You make it sound...
- Furthermore...
- Don't keep interrupting me!
- I'm sorry. What did you wish to say?
Oh, I've forgotten!
Very well. Furthermore, I would deem it a favor if in the future... you and your bloodthirsty relatives... would avoid coming here and upsetting the animals.
In any case, I find it hard to believe that a grown man... can waste his entire life playing with animals in the first place.
And I, madam, find it equally hard to believe... that a grown woman could spend her entire life doing absolutely nothing.
You got to admit that for someone called Fred, she's a fair-looking fellow.
If I were a man
I'd scratch his eyes out
I'd tear his hair out by the roots
And kick his shins in with my boots
And I would bite his hand as only I can
If only I could be a man
A great man would not hesitate
To put Dr. Dolittle to death
Attila the Hun
To name only one
Would chuckle at his dying breath
It seems a man can be as rude as he likes
Crude as he likes
Lewd as he likes too
But a girl must be discreet as she can
Sweet as she can
Neat as she can too
But that's not the life
That I want to lead
Normal and formal as homespun tweed
I need the freedom to go
Where I please
But where
Do I please
I don't know
That's the trouble
I don't know
Here I stand at the crossroads of life
Childhood behind me
The future to come
And alone
Nothing planned at the crossroads of life
But life will find me
More grateful than some
It has known
Grateful to see
All the wonderful things I see
Grateful to be
What life expects me to be
So I stand at the crossroads of life
This way or that way
Well, which shall I go
Towards the left or the right
Towards the day or the night
Towards the dark or the light
Only my heart can know
Only my heart
Can know
- What is it?
- Ha. I don't know, Doctor.
It just arrived for ya.
- It's making funny noises.
- Extraordinary-looking thing.
- It's from Tibet.
It's probably that pink sea snail you was lookin' for.
No, it's not big enough for that.
What do you suppose it is?
Well, we could always open it and find out.
Oh, yes. What a good idea.
Ah. Oh, look, it's a llama.
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
I think he's nervous. Open up the other end and give him a push, Matthew.
Here.
There's another one at this end.
There's two of them.
Two llamas? How thoughtful of somebody.
People are awfully nice.
- What are you going to do with them?
- We could make ourselves... a couple of nice overcoats for a start.
Come on, boy. Come on, boy.
This way, lad. Come on. Come on.
That's a good fella.
I don't believe it. It can't be.
- It is! It is!
- What? What? What?
It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Look.
- Holy O'Reilly. Forgive me.
I'll never touch another drop.
Stubbins, pat the other end.
They're very timid.
This is without doubt the first one that's ever been captured.
If I had a head at each end,
I'd take a bit of catchin' too.
- What's he saying, Doctor?
- It's rather difficult to understand.
It's a camel dialect with rather a thick accent.
- A message? Oh, a message for me.
- Is this it?
Ah, yes, it's from Long Arrow.
I should have guessed.
Who's he when he's at home?
The greatest naturalist in the world and a very old friend.
- He's a Red Indian gentleman.
- With a name like Long Arrow,
I didn't think he was Irish.
- What's all them drawings, Doctor?
- Picture writing.
It's the only way we can communicate.
You see, this means the pushmi-pullyu is a gift.
The open hand, you see?
For me. That's me.
From his friend, Long Arrow.
To make money to take a ship... to search for great pink sea snail.
Signed Long Arrow.
Oh, that's marvelous.
But tell me, Doctor, how do you make money with a pushmi-pullyu?
I thought it was obvious. Stubbins, what would you do if you had two heads?
- I'd join a circus, sir.
- Exactly.
Excuse me. I'm looking for the proprietor.
You've found him. Albert Blossom.
- Splendid. How do you do?
My name's Dolittle.
- I'm not interested.
- I thought you might like to see a rather unusual...
- No, I wouldn't.
It's probably something you haven't seen before.
I've seen everything before.
- Then you aren't interested?
- That's right. I'm not interested.
Come along, Matthew.
- Sorry to have troubled you. Good day.
- Good day.
- It's a trick.
- No, it's no trick.
Why... But... I've never seen anything like it.
- Neither has anybody else.
- Hey, whoa! I say, come here!
Just a minute.
Hey, hey! I mean, l-I've never seen anything like it.
I mean, I've seen the world
I've been around
I can tell you stories that would quite astound you
I'm not a fool
I went to school
I've been from
Liverpool to Istanbul
Istanbul, I'm no fool
And anyone will tell you that
I'm sharper than a knife
But I've never seen anything like it in my life
- It's a pushmi-pullyu.
- Is it?
Well, I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it in my life
- It's the rarest animal on Earth.
- It certainly is!
Hey, hold up a moment. Hey!
I mean, I know the game
I've seen them all
I could tell you stories that would quite enthrall you
I know me job
Pleasin' the mob
I give 'em what they want for just two bob
Just two bob
Well, that's my job
But this is so fantastic
I can't wait to tell the wife
Gertie, you've never seen anything like it in your life
Come on out!
You've never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
You've never seen anything like it in your life
It's a bicranium, madam.
Arthur! Charlie! Joe!
Come and have a look at this!
Beverly, get Joe!
I thought I'd seen every wonder in the world
I've seen the Colosseum in Rome and the Acropolis
I've made the biggest blunder in the world
'Cause I've never seen anything quite like this
Now look what you've done!
You've frightened him!
Hey, come back! Come back!
I'm down to earth
I'll tell you straight
I could tell you stories that would fascinate you
I know the trade
I know the tricks
I once bought an elephant for two pound six
Two pound six
Taught it tricks
But for your pushmi-pullyu
I'd pay three pounds
Four pounds!
Five!
'Cause I've never seen anything like it that's alive
I tell you what.
I'd even pay for it in cash.
Five? That wasn't exactly what we had in mind.
Because, you see, pushmi-pullyus are remarkable creatures
Of all God's animals they're the cleverest
They develop these remarkable features running up and down Mount Everest
- No!
- Yes! Absolutely true.
Runnin' up and down
Mount Everest?
Exactly. You see...
Running up and down the mountain gives them very nimble feet
Put them on the right rope
They could walk a tightrope
That should give the audience a rare old treat
And this extreme agility begets a rare ability
Shared only with the mountain goats of France
The pushmi-pullyu loves to dance
I'll give you anything you want.
- The terms are quite simple.
- Anything you want!
- Four-week engagement.
- Right!
- Share all profits equally.
- Right.
Two performances a day.
Oh, uh, no, uh, four performances a day.
Just a minute.
We have a problem.
Well, what do they want?
Three shows a day.
And four on Saturday?
They agree.
Done!
La, la-la, la
La, la, la, la, la
- My dear Dolittle!
- Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
You've never seen anything like it!
I've never seen anything like it.
Dolittle, me.
Thank you.
- Me.
- No, Dolittle.
I mean, you're not a fool
Neither am I
I could tell you stories that would stultify you
Open your eyes
What do you see
This thing's a miracle for you and me
Guarantee
I agree
Within a meager month
I've seen my wildest dreams come true
'Cause I've never seen anything like it nor have you
Oh, I've never seen anything like it
Never seen anything like it
I've never seen anything like it
In all my
Life
What's the matter with you, Sophie?
Come on, Sophie. Catch it.
Try again, Sophie.
Come on, Sophie.
- That's yours.
- Oh, thanks.
Right, well,
I'm off to the bank.
Ah, here we are now. "Seals are notoriously sentimental creatures.
Prolonged separation from those they love can result... in complete lack of interest in their usual activities."
That would explain why Sophie keeps dropping things in her act.
It isn't like her.
I'm sure she's pining for some reason.
I must go and have a chat with her.
This fellow obviously knows what he's talking about.
- Who wrote the book, Doctor?
- Uh, oh, I did.
- Hmm.
- Just a moment!
I have something to say to you,
- Mr. Dolittle.
- Doctor.
Doctor?
I've heard of some hypocrites in my time, but you are contemptible!
All that sanctimonious claptrap about protecting defenseless creatures, and here you are an animal trainer in a cheap circus!
Exhibiting freaks!
Come, lad. Why don't you go and make some cocoa?
- I don't want any cocoa, do you?
- I'd love some, lad. Yes. Off you go.
Hello, Fred.
He is... He's very rude.
Who, the doctor?
Oh, no, not at all. He's a darlin' man.
Did you hear what he said about my uncle?
Oh, that, yeah, well, he's a darlin' man, but he's very rude.
Of course, I wouldn't mind so much except everything he said was true.
You should never believe anybody who goes around tellin' the truth.
They're not to be trusted.
Ya have to do it both ends.
Otherwise it gets jealous.
He was too ashamed to say anything just now, of course.
- Too nice.
- Nice?
He's the kindest man on God's Earth, Fred.
He understands animals better than you and me will ever understand anythin'.
Well, I certainly don't understand him.
Ah, sure, now.
He's one of the beautiful people.
And I'm sure now he's one of the horrible people.
You're wrong, sweetheart.
I can't explain what it is that he is
But he is what he is for a very good reason
I can't explain why he does what he does
But he does what he does
'cause his heart is pure
Of that much
I am sure
I'm sure as I told young Tom the other day
He lives in a world of fantasy
And that is a world
I plan to see, fantasy
Can't you see
The world is full of beautiful things
Butterfly wings
Fairy tale kings
And each new day undoubtedly brings
Still more beautiful things
The world abounds with many delights
Magical sights
Fanciful flights
And those who dream on beautiful nights
Dream of beautiful things
Beautiful days for sunshine lazin'
Beautiful skies and shores
Beautiful days when I can gaze
In beautiful eyes
Like yours
Our lives tick by like a pendulum swings
Poor little things
Puppets on strings
But life is full
Of beautiful things
Beautiful people
Too
Beautiful people
Like
You
I see. I see.
I'm sorry. Hmm.
Ah, cocoa.
Come in, gentlemen.
You know Sophie, don't you?
Oh, yes, of course you do.
It seems we have a problem on our hands.
Sophie's just been telling me how much she misses her husband.
That's why she couldn't concentrate on her performance, just as I thought.
- Where is her husband?
- The North Pole. That's the problem.
They were on their way there when Sophie was captured.
If she doesn't get back to him, she feels she's going to go completely to pieces.
What do you want us to do?
Go to the North Pole?
Unfortunately, there isn't time, but it's very pleasant up there.
But the North Pole hasn't been discovered yet.
Not officially.
I'd never say anything about it.
I promised the polar bears I wouldn't.
Anyway, that's beside the point.
What we've got to do is to get Sophie back to her husband.
Now, if I could get her to the Bristol Channel, she could swim it in about a week.
You go along there, around that bit, then straight on and then slightly to the left.
Oh, that's great, but how does she get to the Bristol Channel?
- Well, she'd have to escape.
- Escape? A seal?
I can hardly go to Blossom and say she wanted to go to the North Pole to see her husband.
He wouldn't believe a word.
- You know something?
- What?
- She's gonna have to escape.
- Tonight.
Shh. Shh.
- Is everything all right, sir?
- It's my grandmother.
She's not very well.
I'm taking her to Bristol.
- Can you smell fish?
- Fish?
It's Granny.
She's on a special diet.
Very wise, sir.
Are you all right, dear?
Enjoying the trip?
Oh, that's good.
Whoa! Whoa!
What's the delay?
What's going on there?
Jack Fitch, the highwayman, has been seen on this road.
We have to search all coaches.
Help yourself.
You'll find no surprise in here.
All right, driver.
All right, get up.
All right, go on.
Come back here, Nelly!
Nelly, come back here!
Where are you going?
Where are you going, Nelly?
Come on back!
Come back here, I tell ya!
Well, here we are. Sorry it was such an uncomfortable journey, but it was really the only way.
There, there, there, Sophie.
Don't get upset.
I can't bear females who cry.
Shh. Don't look at me like that, Sophie, or I'll get upset too.
Dear Sophie, you understand so much, don't you?
When I look in your eyes
I see the wisdom of the world in your eyes
I see the sadness of a thousand good-byes
When I look in your eyes
Shh, shh.
And it is no surprise
To see the softness of the moon in your eyes
The gentle sparkle of the stars in the skies
When I look in your eyes
In your eyes I see the deepness of the sea
I see the deepness
Of the love, the love
I feel you feel for me
Autumn comes, summer dies
I see the passing of the years in your eyes
And when we part, there will be no tears, no good-byes
I'll just look into your eyes
Dear Sophie
Those eyes so wise
So warm, so real
Isn't it a pity you're a seal
Well, she's on her way.
- What did you throw her in for?
- She wanted to go back to her husband.
No, you don't understand at all.
She wasn't a woman. She was a seal.
- A seal?
- Yes.
Dressed in a bonnet and shawl?
That's right. Yes. I'd sort of borrowed it from this lady in the tavern.
The bonnet had a little brown ribbon through...
Never mind about the brown ribbons.
You then took the seal to Bristol in a stagecoach... and upon arrival promptly threw her over a cliff.
Exactly.
May one ask why?
Uh, certainly. Um, she wanted to go to the North Pole to see her husband.
- Her husband?
- Yes.
What makes you think this seal wanted to go to the North Pole?
- Well, she told me.
- She told you?
Yes, we discussed it in great detail.
Are you in the habit of talking to animals?
Yes, I am.
I do it all the time.
I thought perhaps you did.
With all due respect to
Your Worship, I think I detect a note of skepticism in the court.
I would, therefore, like an opportunity... to prove the point by talking to any animal you care to nominate.
Very well then.
My dog Rufus is outside. Bring him in!
Oh, that's very kind of you.
This way, please.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yes, Rufus will be only too happy to answer any questions you care to ask.
Oh, I think we can dispense with that formality.
Uh, ask him what I had for dinner last night.
Very well.
Did he?
Well, really? Did he?
Good Lord. Well, well.
Did he really?
Well, well, well.
What did he say?
I'm grateful that Your Worship acknowledges the fact that the dog was talking.
For dinner last night,
Your Lordship enjoyed the following:
Two helpings of boiled trout, four helpings of roast pheasant, roast potatoes, brussels sprouts and gravy,
Followed by six large portions of blackberry pie with whipped cream.
It's not true! I only had five helpings of blackberry pie!
Your Lordship also drank a great deal of wine and brandy... and later in the evening sang noisy songs with your friends about a woman from Swansea...
That's enough!
The court is adjourned until tomorrow morning, pending inquiries about the bonnet and shawl stolen from the tavern in question.
Hmm. Thank you.
Well, by my calculation, the trial will be over by 11:00 tomorrow morning.
Polynesia, how much did we earn from the circus?
206 pounds, seven and fourpence, halfpenny.
Ah, it's more than enough.
I see no reason why we shouldn't set out to find the pink sea snail right away.
Matthew, go to the house and pick up my clothes.
Have the boat ready to sail by 12:00.
We'll catch the noontide or whatever it's called.
We haven't got a crew, so we'll have to make due with you and Stubbins and the animals.
I can come too?
If your parents say so and you know how to tie a knot.
Hear that? We're going to help the doctor find the pink sea snail.
I should wait until you see his boat before you get too excited.
It isn't by chance it's called the Flounder.
No sailor in his right mind would touch it.
I'm not asking a sailor in his right mind. I was asking you.
What do you say?
I say that for a man who's about to be hanged for murder... to be gettin' ready to go on a pleasure cruise shows a very nice outlook.
- Fred!
- To what do we owe this, uh, pleasure?
- I've brought dinner.
- Dinner?
- Yes, for Matthew and Tommy.
- Oh.
Set it down there, Hubert.
Steak and kidney pie and oxtail and roast beef.
- Would you like some?
- Uh, no.
Oh, come on, Doctor.
Ya haven't had a bite all day.
- No, thank you.
- He's a vegetarian.
Oh, no!
It, uh, seems a pity to waste it.
It's all right, Matthew.
Um, carry on.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
Come on, Tom.
Doctor?
Um, Rufus was right.
He did have six helpings of blackberry pie.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you, Chee-Chee.
It seems that a bonnet and shawl were, in fact, removed... from the tavern in question on the day in question.
The lady who owns them, for reasons best known to herself, has no wish to prosecute.
You are, therefore, acquitted of the charge of murder.
Thank you very much.
However, your performance in this courtroom in the past two days... has left little doubt in the minds of my distinguished colleagues and myself... that your lunatic activities with animals infringe upon the public safety... and are not to be tolerated.
Happily, Her Majesty's farseeing benevolence provides a sanctuary for sad people like you... who think they can talk to animals and want to treat them like human beings.
Therefore, it is the judgment of this court... that you be committed indefinitely to an asylum for the insane.
Have you anything to say?
I do not understand the human race
It has so little love for creatures
With a different face
Treating animals like people is no madness or disgrace
I do not understand the human race
I wonder why do we treat animals like animals
Animals treat us so very well
The devoted way they serve us and protect us when we're nervous
Oh, they really don't deserve us
All we give them is hell
Tell me how else man repays them
Do we ever think to praise them, no, we don't
And this dismays them
You can tell
We are riddled with ingratitude
We give no love or latitude
In every way our attitude is well, like animals
No, no. That's not what I mean. I mean...
Why do we treat animals like animals
How can people be so inhumane
Cows and chickens work to feed us
Dogs and horses show they need us
And though cats don't always heed us their affection is plain
What do we do, we neglect them
We do nothing to protect them
We reject them
Don't expect them to complain
We ignore them or we beat them
When we're hungry then we eat them
It's appalling how we treat them, it's insane
Like animals
We humiliate and murder and confine them
We create their wretched status
Then we use it to malign them
I mean, why should we say
Treat him like a dog
Why should we say
Working like a horse
Why should we say
Eating like a hog
When what we mean is
Eating like a man
Don't we, of course
A man of ill repute is called a weasel or a rat
A woman you dislike becomes a vixen or a cat
A family that is blessed with healthy reproductive habits
Occasions the remark, well, you know them, they breed like rabbits
He's as stubborn as a mule
He's as stupid as an ox
He's as slimy as a snake
He's as crafty as a fox
Remarks like that really get my goat
Why don't we say
Noble as a frog
Or why can't we say
Wealthy as a hen
True, we say
Devoted as a dog
What we should say is
Chic as a giraffe
Pretty as a pig, eh
That will be the big day, won't it
But when, but when
But when, when will we stop treating them like animals
Is the human race entirely mad
Women see a baby goatskin or a lambskin or a stoatskin
And to them it's just a coatskin
Oh, it's terribly sad
When you dress in suede or leather or some fancy fur or feather
Do you stop and wonder whether for a fad
You have killed some beast or other
That you're wearing someone's brother
Or perhaps it's someone's mother in which you're clad
Like animals
Like animals
Like animals
Well, it's true
We do not live in a zoo
But man is an animal too
So why can't you
Like me
Like animals
Animals
Now, the prison faces the road here.
So what we do is we tie the ropes from the bars of the cell to the elephant, and he pulls the whole wall off.
How can you go on the voyage if the doctor's still in prison?
We can't. That's why Matthew's got this marvelous plan to get him out.
Then this second elephant... he's bigger than the first elephant...
All the doctor has to do is step through the hole in the wall onto his back.
- You'll never get away with this.
- Listen, here's the clever part.
He slides down the elephant's trunk onto a waitin' rhinoceros and away they go!
Just the three of you are going off on this boat?
Oh, no. Chee-Chee, Polynesia and Jip are coming too.
Then there's these six tigers, you see, to stop anyone followin'.
To look for a pink sea snail?
They'll be standing on the other side of the road while I'm settin' off the dynamite.
- Dynamite?
- Oh, sure.
If we blow up the road, they'll have to go all the way around the town to get to the harbor, which gives me time to nip back here... and blow up the bridge while you're gettin' on the boat.
That's the beauty of this whole plan... its simplicity.
- Are they really going to keep the doctor in prison?
- Oh, no, no.
They're moving him across to the loony bin at 12:00.
- Today?
- Aye.
I've also an idea.
You get the boat ready.
Leave the doctor to me.
We sail at 12:00. Avast now.
Aye, aye, sir.
We're a fine bunch, takin' orders from a parrot.
Matthew, how did you enjoy the food I brought you in the prison the other night?
'Twas the best meal
I ever had in me life.
They say that prison food is terrible.
I won't hear a word against it.
I was thinking.
Wouldn't it be nice if you were to have those kind of meals on your voyage?
Oh, true now.
It would be marvelous.
The only way we could do that is if you was to...
If we was to, uh...
Ah!
I'll tell you one thing, Fred.
I only hope there's no stowaways on that boat.
Because if there was,
I wouldn't know where to look for them.
Anyway, once we're out at sea with an escaped convict, there's no turnin' back.
Oh, Matthew!
I love you!
Who would have thought that one little kiss
Soft and sweet from the lips of a lovely girl
Would to change my life
But by my life
It will
After today nothing will be the same again
After today I'll make my claim to fame and then
The grass will be greener
And the air will be cleaner
And my life be serener
Than heaven knows when
Heaven knows when
After today I shall have bid my fears good-bye
After today I shall have no more tears
To cry
I'll learn to live with laughter to stay
After
Today
After today nothing will be the way it was
After today I'll say
Oh, what a day it was
My heart will be lighter
And my smile will be brighter
And I'll be twice the fighter
That ever I was
Clever because
After today I shall have bid my fears farewell
After today I shall have no more tears
To quell
I'll learn to live with laughter
To stay
After the tears comes the laughter
After today
Chee-Chee.
Run! Run!
Stop!
Don't follow the doctor!
Don't obey! Don't obey!
Right!
Come on! This way!
Don't sit down!
- Get up!
- After them!
Go after him!
This way. Come on. After him. This way.
- This way! No, this way!
- Ta-ta.
- Stop them!
- Stop them! Stop them!
It's all right, Doctor.
You can come out now.
- There's not a policeman in sight.
- Oh, thank you, Matthew.
Makes a very good little reading room, this. I must use it more often.
Now, let's see where we are.
Ah, I see.
He says there's a faint smell of garlic coming from the southeast.
- What does that mean?
- It means we're about ten miles off the coast of France.
I've got about the best navigational system on the high seas today.
Jip's got this incredible sense of smell, and Polynesia gets marvelous weather reports from the passing birds and fishes.
- Everything all right at the house?
- Yes, Doctor.
Good. Keep an eye on everything and don't bump into anything like Ireland.
Aye, aye, Doctor.
- A very well organized escape.
Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
I doubt if there's a ship afloat with flowers like these.
Look at these geraniums.
Absolutely glorious.
Have you seen my azaleas on the starboard side?
- No, sir, I can't say as I have.
- They're doing wonderfully.
How are you enjoying life on the rolling deep?
If the good Lord meant us to take to water, He'd have given us flippers.
No, Stubbins, move your mouth about more.
You must reread my essay on basic chimpanzee, page one.
I must cut these roses back.
There's so much to do on a ship.
What a marvelous smell, Matthew.
What have you been cooking?
I'm absolutely starving.
Will this do?
Do come on while it's still hot.
What are you doing here?
I thought someone capable ought to look after Tommy on the voyage.
Stubbins is perfectly capable of looking after himself.
I must turn the ship around and go straight back to Puddleby... uh, well, immediately after lunch.
They'll, uh... They'll put ya inside if you go back, Doctor.
Oh, yes, that is a point.
What are we going to do with her if she stays?
You make me sound like a stray cat.
A cat would be most welcome.
Don't worry. It's vegetarian.
- It's delicious.
- It's marvelous.
Mmm. What is it?
- Algue marine en croute.
- Oh, yes.
- What's that in English?
- Seaweed pie.
Mmm! It's really rather good.
- Well, where are we going?
- To hunt for the great pink sea snail.
And where do you expect to find it?
I haven't the faintest idea.
But as one place is as good as another, it's high time we decided.
- Otherwise, when we get there, we won't know we've arrived.
- Good thinking.
- Thank you.
- Are your voyages always as well planned as this?
When possible. Unfortunately, one doesn't always have time to go into minute details.
- Such as knowing where you're going?
- That sort of thing.
But then how do you decide?
We play a little game I invented.
One of us opens the atlas at random, sticks a pin in the open page.
Wherever it lands, that's where we go.
- You can't be serious.
- I'm very serious.
That is the most ridiculous thing
I have ever heard of.
You could end up in all sorts of terrible places.
That's absolutely true.
I remember going to the Sahara Desert four times in succession... before I realized Chee-Chee had stuck down all the other pages of the atlas with jam.
Marvelous trips. Lots of sand.
But that is exactly what I mean.
It's all right now. I cleaned all the jam off. Little bit there.
How you can sit there and say what you're saying I just don't know.
I must admit the Sahara is one place
I'm praying we just won't go.
You know, that's absolutely typical of a woman.
There are so many fabulous faraway places to see
She makes one seaweed pie and goes mad.
Such as Mexico, Sweden
Hawaii, Japan and Capri
Who does she think she is?
There's so many exciting and wonderful places
Much more inviting than desert oases
Pleasant as home is it isn't what Rome is
So why stay there
When there are so many fabulous faraway places to see
As though the seaweed pie was all that marvelous.
Why should Spain and Tahiti and Rio
- Just be only names to you and me
- Is there any more?
I feel certain there are people we'd be glad to know there
So tell me why don't we get up and go there
Go to those fabulous places where we long to be
Go to Bangkok and Hong Kong and Paris and Venice
Tokyo and Cairo and Lisbon and London
Wonderful, fabulous places
We're longing to see
When I think of the warm Caribbean
I see a new world for you and me
I'd give anything just to have one single day there
Once we get there
I know that we'll stay there
Stay in those fabulous places where we long to be
-  Such as Siam
-  Sienna
-  Vienna
-  Verona
- Java, Jamaica
- Jamaica, Bombay
-  Barcelona
- Ole!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
- El toro!
- Ha, ha!
- Ole! Ole! Ole!
Show me those fabulous places
I'm longing to see
My dear Miss Fairfax, you seem to have entirely missed the point.
I'm aware there are fabulous places wherever we sail
- Will we see them?
- We will.
But the point of the journey is science and finding the snail
An incomparable thrill
We shall question the sharks off the coast of Tobago
Interview swamp life in Tierra del Fuego
-  That sounds horrendous
-  No, no, it's tremendous and well worthwhile
We'll make detailed inquiries of every crustacean we meet
- Crustacean?
-  Shellfish, they're sweet
We will sail to the ends of the earth
Till our search for the snail is quite complete
We'll interrogate beetles and bugs in Nigeria
And if we have to spend weeks in Siberia
Eighty below but a place that we all ought to see
But I haven't brought the right clothes for Siberia
Those are the fabulous places you'll visit with me
Sounds as if we're in for a good time.
Well, Siberia is one place you'll never see me go
Stick in the pin
Where the pins goes, then we go
- Ireland!
- Romania!
- No, Ruritania!
We'll chase that sea snail from here to Tasmania
Show me those fabulous places
I'm longing to
I'm longing to
See
It doesn't count.
You landed in the sea.
No, she hasn't. Look. There.
Well, that doesn't look very interesting.
- What is it?
- "Sea Star Island.
Last reported position."
Last reported position?
What can that mean?
The Sea Star Island. That's faintly familiar. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
"Seashore, sea slug, sea snail.
Sea Star Island."
It's that floating island.
It moves all over the world like a ship.
It's a freak of nature.
This time of year it's sometimes sighted off the coast of Africa.
How terribly exciting.
I think you have chosen rather well.
I don't think it's exciting at all.
Couldn't we go to...
Couldn't we go to Monte Carlo?
Miss Fairfax, this is a serious zoogeographical expedition.
It's not a pleasure cruise for your personal benefit.
I promise to ask for no special privileges.
I promise to grant none.
A ship is no place for a woman.
The simple answer then is to treat me like a man.
I intend to.
Well, good-bye.
Twelve.
Uh-huh. How is the score, Stubbins?
And the arithmetic?
You're winning, sir, I think.
Ah, well, that's the first sure sign we've been at sea too long.
Polynesia spoke to some swallows.
They said there's a terrific storm up ahead. Isn't that marvelous?
No, it isn't.
Can't we drive round it?
I shouldn't think so.
The latest long-range fish forecast wasn't too encouraging.
Jip said he could smell thunder.
- I didn't know thunder had a smell.
- It does if you're a dog.
Uh, 82. Mind you,
Jip does tend to exaggerate.
If you ask me, bein' at sea is very much the same as bein' in prison, except at sea ya stand a better chance of drownin'.
That reminds me. One of the ship's rats came to see me this afternoon.
Said he had a distinct tingle in his tail, a sure sign the ship was going down.
So his lot are preparing to leave, according to rat tradition.
He highly recommended we should do the same.
There's nowhere we can go.
- Exactly. That's what I told the rat.
- Two.
- What was that?
- A bit of lightning. That's all.
When you finish clearing up, you better batten down the hatches and stay below.
Women are always scared stiff of storms.
Well, I'm not.
I'm a man, remember?
I dread to think what this is going to do to my azaleas.
August 10.
Signs of inclement weather.
Crew's morale remains high.
Steady as she goes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, indeed.
- Any sign of her, Polynesia?
- Not yet.
Ah, good morning, Stubbins.
Beautiful day.
Yes, sir, good morning.
What happened to the ship?
Very good question.
If we ever find enough bits, we'll put them together and find out.
Come on, Matthew.
Rise and shine.
I told ya Flounder was a terrible name for a boat.
Nonsense. The flounder's a most reliable little fish.
It's survived the sea for thousands of years.
Aye, below the surface.
Anyway, we're all safe.
That's the main thing.
- At least, we will be as soon as we find Miss Fairfax.
- Poor Fred.
I said all along a ship was no place for a woman.
Heaven knows I did my best to make the voyage pleasant for her.
You can't spend your life running after a woman, waiting on her hand and foot when there's important work to be done.
I think under the circumstances
I treated her very well.
Probably too well.
Spoiled her, in fact.
And I tied her very securely to that raft.
I hope she's all right.
That's all.
- We'll make a full-scale search as soon as we get ashore.
- Ashore?
Sea Star Island.
That's where we're going, isn't it?
Apart from the fact that we're shipwrecked, that we have no means of gettin' there, and that we don't know where it is anyway, yes.
You mustn't worry about things like that, Matthew.
By my calculations, we were sort of coming down in this direction like this, and the floating island was sort of coming down in that direction like that.
Then we sort of somehow or other sort of more or less meet... somewhere round about here.
Is that a fact?
Ah! There it is now.
Well, shall we go ashore?
Giddyap.
I must remember to get meself one of those.
Hmph. Any sign of Fred?
Not yet. I only hope she caught the island.
It won't be passing here again for months.
You and Stubbins search the beaches.
I'll go inland.
- Meet back here in two or three hours.
- Yeah. Tommy?
Polynesia, I want every living creature on this island looking for that girl.
Yes, Doctor.
- Every bird that can fly I want airborne until she's found.
- Yes, Doctor.
She can't be at sea.
We'd have heard from the fish by now.
- You sure she'll be all right, Polynesia?
- Yes, Doctor.
She's standing right behind you.
Good morning.
Oh, good morning.
Um, afraid we had a bit of a storm last night.
Thank you for telling me.
Pity you got lost. You could have given us a hand getting these ashore.
I'm sorry. I was fully occupied getting myself ashore.
No mind. We managed. Some of these books are very heavy though.
Saved all your books, I see.
- Yes, most fortunate.
- You lost all my dresses.
Yes, most unfortunate. I saw your trunk floating amongst the wreckage.
However, the outfit you're wearing this morning... is the nicest thing I've seen you in since you left England.
This is my underwear.
Oh. Anyway, it suits you.
I'm terribly glad to see you.
Are you?
Uh, well, we got a tremendous lot to do.
We've got to unload the raft, find food and build whatever it is one has to build.
- What are you trying to say?
- Hmm?
Why don't you say what you mean?
What do you mean, say what I mean?
For a month or more
I have listened and dreamed
While the moon has glistened and a million stars have gleamed
-  Waiting
- Waiting?
-  Waiting
- What for?
What for?  For a man
I know who is clever and kind
But a man who never ever seems to know his mind
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting for you to say you like me
Or hate me or miss me or kiss me or something
But nothing
Nothing do you say
At all
Little wonder I feel sorely neglected
Unwanted, rejected and small
Little more than two feet tall
Lucky to be here
At all
Emma?
I think I... like you.
Yes, I think I do.
I think I like you.
I'm almost sure that I do
I think I like the way you look
The way your eyes reveal your mind
Like a precious book that's hard to find
I think I'm learning something strange and new
But it's well worth learning
Because I'm learning about you
Like dawning sunshine
When a new day is due
I think I like you
And I think you like me too
Do you?
Do you?
Do you?
Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
Good heavens. I do believe that's a great crested oriental moonbird.
It's terribly rare.
I'm so glad we came.
Great crested oriental moonbird.
What a bit of luck.
Ah, that's better.
Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.
The locals aren't a very friendly lot, are they?
I bet you anything you like they're going to kill us.
Whoever said children had beautiful minds had obviously never met you.
Bein' in prison is much the same as bein' on a boat, except in prison there's less chance of drownin'.
And less chance of our getting back to Puddleby.
I must have a serious talk to whoever runs this place.
I promised to get Stubbins home in time to go to school.
I'm sure if you tell them that we'll be out of here in no time.
Give me a leg up.
I want to see what's going on out there.
Good heavens.
All right, Matthew. Down.
- Why is it so cold?
- It's like being back in England.
There's a bit of frost. That's all.
It's quite clear what happened.
The storm that sank the Flounder must have blown the island off its usual course.
We're drifting too far north.
If we don't do something about it, that marvelous vegetation is going to die of frostbite.
To say nothin' of our dear selves.
This is obviously the gentleman to talk to.
Good morning.
Me Dr. Dolittle.
Search for great pink sea snail.
Small boy late for school.
Here very cold.
They all go home
Puddleby, yes?
What a funny accent.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Actually, that's what
I came to see you about.
My name is William Shakespeare, the Tenth. You may call me Willie.
Come with me, please.
Thank you.
We've had lots of shipwrecks, of course.
Being a floating island does tend to make us a bit of a danger to shipping.
We've bumped into lots of things over the years.
But on the credit side, it enabled us to build a marvelous museum... and public library... books and art treasures from all over the place.
Everybody on the island speaks nine or ten languages.
We even name our children after our favorite authors.
That's why my name is William Shakespeare.
Do forgive this paraphernalia.
We're rehearsing now
The Merchant Of Venice for our Shakespeare drama festival.
- Do sit down. Milk or lemon?
- Milk, please.
Must be a near perfect civilization.
Then what are we doin' in prison?
Purely a precaution, old boy, a sort of quarantine.
Most of the white men who have come here in the past... usually started killing people before they've been introduced.
- Extraordinary. Help yourself to sugar.
- Thank you.
But they never stay long.
They can't stand the peace and quiet.
I love peace and quiet, but unfortunately we won't be able to stay long either.
We've got to continue our hunt for the great pink sea snail.
You haven't by any chance heard of it being in the vicinity?
At the moment you have a bigger problem than looking for snails.
According to popular superstition, newcomers to the island are responsible for all our misfortunes.
So the elders of the village are blaming you for this frost.
I don't know what we can do about that. Perhaps there is something I can think of.
I do hope so for your sake.
You see, it's written here in the law book.
"He who brings sunshine to the coldness of our days... shall bask in the splendor of a thousand summers."
- That's very nice.
- Yeah.
Yes, but it goes on.
"He who brings winter into the summer of our lives... shall die the death of a thousand screams."
- Oh.
- I prefer the first one.
Yes, so did I.
The elders are also blaming you for what's happened to the animals.
What has happened to the animals?
They've all caught colds.
They're coughing and sneezing all over the place.
I must do something about this immediately. Come along, Polynesia.
We've got work to do.
Bless you.
Gesundheit.
Ha.
Here you are, Tommy. Another little baby lion for you to take care of.
Yes, sir.
Bless you.
That inhalant seems to be working very well.
Bless you.
I was hoping this mustard bath would work.
Still very hot.
How soon will my cough mixture be ready?
- Five minutes. Smell.
- Mmm!
I'd give it to the baby elephant first, if I were you.
- Why?
- She's got a terrible cold.
I want to control it before she gives it to the family.
When a herd of elephants start sneezing, it's like a hurricane.
Might drive the island even further off course. Thank you very much.
If we was to point them in the right direction, perhaps they could blow us back on course.
Pretty good theory, but terribly difficult to organize.
If elephants could swim, one good shove... and we'd be back in a southerly current before we could...
Why didn't I think of that before?
- They can swim.
- What, elephants?
No, no, no, Matthew. Tommy, what's as big as an elephant that can swim?
A whale, sir.
Exactly.
Emma, get on with the cough mixture.
Bless you.
Now, how do you get in touch with a whale?
I'll talk to him immediately.
Splendid.
Good morning. Marvelous, if the giraffe doesn't mind.
Extremely kind of you.
I do appreciate it.
Bless you.
You'll explain? Good.
Here he comes.
It was very decent of that turtle to put us in touch with him.
My word! He's a big fellow.
Now, if he gave a shove below us, that should just about do the trick.
Good morning.
One... shove... here.
We really must learn to speak a few words of whale.
Apparently they're very nice, but nobody ever talks to them.
Look!
Why is it doing that?
The island is bound to roll a bit after that shove.
It set that balancing rock in motion.
- It'll soon calm down.
- That would be highly desirable.
It says here in the law book,
"He who causes the great rock to fall into the hot mountain... shall die the death of 10,000 screams."
- Uh, how many screams did you say?
I shouldn't have thought it was worth more than five.
- I cannot tell you how upset I am about this.
- You're upset?
We realize it isn't your fault.
I've been through the law book from cover to cover.
There is nothing I can do.
- This is the tradition.
- Oh, well, we hate to break a tradition.
I once heard a story about a tribe that burned people alive, then et them for dinner.
I bet that's what they're going to do to us.
Will you please put a curb on your lurid imagination?
I'm sorry about this, Emma.
It hasn't been very relaxing the last few days, has it?
I think we've bumped into something.
Stop!
Release them!
Holy Pat.
What did we do now?
We've collided with the mainland.
The two pieces fit perfectly.
- How extraordinary.
- Not really.
The oldest legend of the island has always maintained... that we are a bit of Africa that has been missing for 5,000 years.
Is there a reward for finding it?
Oh, indeed, yes.
"He who brings back the lost island from the sea... shall live as a god for a thousand moons."
Thank you. Thank you.
That's very pleasant, but if you will excuse me,
I must get back to the hospital, in case the elephant sneezes and blows all the other patients away.
What will you do when the animals are all well again?
I have one great ambition.
I came to find a great pink sea snail.
I intend to find it.
The great pink sea snail is more than mythical.
I always thought that, too, Willie.
No, no. You can see the animals as they come out.
- Guard the gate, Matthew.
- Oh!
Come on. Come on.
- Why does he have the animals in there?
- All right, all right.
I'll tell ya.
Behind these gates is the most wonderful place in all the world.
- Can we see it?
- Can we see it?
- Shh!
- Shh!
This is the world of Dr. Dolittle
The wonderful world of Dr. Dolittle
Where crocodiles talk and elephants sing
And animals do most any old thing
Where polar bears wear top hats
And leopards with spots wear spats
Well, that's life in the world of Dr. Dolittle
Doves start to coo when they see Dolittle
He has a profound philosophy
If animals can be friends says he
Well, then why can't we
Matthew, open the gate.
Come on, baby. Up!
See they're all right, Matthew.
Say how do you do to the world of Dr. Dolittle
Say how do you do to the world of Dr. Dolittle
Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle
Life is a zoo to Dr. Dolittle
Where antelopes lope
-  And ostriches fan
-  And ostriches fan
And kangaroos do what kangaroos can
To make the hyenas laugh
As long as a long giraffe
Every calf starts to moo when they see Dolittle
Even the few who used to moo little
For all of the birds and beasts agree
He has a profound philosophy
And so why can't
We.
All of the birds and beasts agree
He has a profound philosophy
And so why can't we
Do little things to help them
Why
Can't
We
Oh.
Well, thank goodness they only had head colds.
Think how terrible it would have been if they'd had sore throats.
Our last two patients.
Well done, Emma.
Well, not a sniffle left on the island.
Interesting noise. Can't be.
You mean, the great pink sea snail...
Precisely, and by the sound of it, he seems to have caught a chill too.
So sorry.
I've never seen anything like it.
- Yes, I see.
Well, just a minute. Amazing!
- What is?
We've been searching for weeks for the great snail.
He's been with us all the time.
Lives in an underground cave and moves about with the island.
I was quite right. He's got a shocking cold. I told him I was a doctor, and if he'd come on the beach,
I'd mix him a batch of my special tonic.
It'll need to be rather large, won't it?
What's that?
- What is it?
- He's purring.
Thrilled with his medicine. Feels much more relaxed, almost like a new snail.
- Wanted to know if there's anything he can do for us.
- Is there?
Yes, he can take you all safely back to Puddleby.
Oh, well. Well, that's a bit of an imposition.
Puddleby's a long way away. All you did was give him a little medicine.
He's 2,000 years old.
He's lonely. It'll be company for him.
He'd been planning to visit his cousin in Scotland for 300 years and put it off.
Be a great opportunity for him.
- His cousin in Scotland?
- You've heard of the Loch Ness monster?
- Yes.
- Well, it's a cousin.
- Good heavens.
- Travel under the sea?
But it's bad enough on top.
We'd all drown, Doctor.
No, the shell is completely watertight.
It'll be like traveling in a big pink bubble.
Yes, he says he can get you back to Puddleby by two weeks from Tuesday.
This must be the only snail in the world with four bedrooms.
Oh, and, Polynesia, don't forget to remind the snail to surface twice a day for his cough mixture.
It will fix up his cold, and stretch your legs and get some sea air.
- Yes, Doctor.
- Oh, good.
I'd hate to miss my turn on deck.
And, Chee-Chee, don't eat all the bananas. Leave some for the others.
Shh, shh. Don't be sad.
That's all, sir.
Good-bye, Stubbins.
Go up to the house whenever you like.
Yes, sir. And, Doctor, come home soon, sir.
Well...
Well, I'll, uh... I'll send your other high hat back from Puddleby, Doctor.
The snail can bring it back with him.
Yours is looking a little grubby now.
You'll probably find it a bit difficult to get one here.
Yes, uh, probably.
Well, thank you, Matthew.
Well, uh, good-bye.
Bye.
Uh, give my love to everyone at home, to Gub-Gub and Dab-Dab and everyone.
Good-bye, John Dolittle.
Take care!
Well, Tom, I still wish he was comin' with us.
I've never driven one of these things before.
Sure you won't change your mind and come with us?
I can't, Emma. Your uncle will put me away the moment I set foot in Puddleby.
But you have to come back one day.
I hope so. A lot of animals depend on me.
One or two people too.
Puddleby's going to seem very dull after all this excitement.
I mean, what are you going to do here?
I think I'll start planning my next voyage.
Where are you going this time? The moon?
- Very probably, yes.
- You're not serious.
- Oh, yes.
- How?
On the giant lunar moth.
Magnificent creature.
Flies backwards and forwards between the earth and the moon.
When it reaches one, it's attracted by the light of the other and flies back again.
Willie tells me there's one on the island.
My idea is to build some sort of saddle arrangement,
- very secure, so I don't fall off halfway.
- Can I come?
Hmm?
Can I come with you?
Emma, I'm afraid...
I'm not very good with people.
L... I'm all right with animals, but people...
I'm not very good with.
I never have been.
I don't know why.
I'll write to you.
I'll organize an air postal service with the seagulls.
I'll miss you, John Dolittle.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, Tom.
If we ever drown in this thing, it'll be in a flood of tears.
Sophie. What are you doing here?
No. Oh, how do you do, sir?
Really? Good Lord.
Sophie, that's marvelous news.
Thank you very much, indeed.
Good-bye, Sophie.
Thank you. Thank you!
"Good night, sweet Prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest."
Willie! Willie!
Wonderful news.
Sophie, the seal, and her husband have come to tell me... all the animals in England are on strike.
They refuse to do any work until I'm reprieved.
- You can go home?
- Yes. The local magistrate is begging me to go back.
The whole country's paralyzed without the animals.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.
I think that tree is about the right size.
It's a 60-foot overall wingspan.
- But you've missed the snail.
- I've got a better idea.
I'm going to fly home.
Can you imagine their faces when they see me on the quayside waiting for them in Puddleby?
- Fly home?
- Since you say there's one on the island, on the lunar moth.
- Help me make a model so I can gauge where to put the saddle.
- Certainly.
I've got to allow for a very steep rate of climb.
Now, you see, you'll be the wings.
All of you. That's it.
Just sit down inside those lines I've just drawn.
Everybody. That's the idea.
Good. Yes, I think it's going to work splendidly.
As soon as I've built this saddle, we'll go and have a chat with the lunar moth.
I only hope he understands common house moth. That's all I speak.
Then as soon as the moon comes up, we'll be off to Puddleby.
Wonderful night for flying.
By my calculations I should be home in time for breakfast.
The stars are made of lemon drops
The bigger ones are lollipops and ice
The clouds have shops up on the tops
That sell you sweets and soda pops
What do they call the place
Isn't it paradise
Maybe what the doctor tells me
Isn't altogether true
But I know every tale he tells me
I don't know any better ones
Do you
My friend the doctor says the world is full of fantasy
And who are you and I to disagree
Let's hope and pray that is the way
The life we love will always stay
For my friend the doctor
And me
NARRATOR: In the 11th century,
Europe was a patchwork of feudal states, extending from the
Mediterranean to the North Sea.
Powerful dukes exerted life-and-death control... over their primitive subjects.
One such, Duke William of Ghent, held a coastal area in Normandy.
To protect the marshes of a troubled corner of his domain, the Duke sent warriors led by his most trusted knight,
Chrysagon de la Cruex.
This Norman warlord was charged to impose the Duke's will... on his vassals and to protect their settlements... from Frisian raiders, who crossed the waters... to plunder and pillage.
MAN: Hey-oh!
United tower.
From here to the sea and beyond, it's yours.
Mine.
SECOND MAN:
From here to the sea.
We're pilgrims to nowhere, and we have arrived.
What's the matter, Draco?
Your belly hurt?
- L, Milord?
- What is it, Brother?
What did you expect?
Whatever you want.
Your wish is mine.
For myself, I expect nothing.
[Birds squawking]
Queer, moody place.
Still, it's mine.
Given by the Duke himself.
A holding no man in all Christendom wanted.
I want it.
You have it, and you'll keep it, Brother, as the Lord kept Israel.
This place has the dimensions of heresy.
[Horn sounds]
[Birds screeching]
[Horn sounds]
An alarm.
Raiders from the sea.
Frisian raiders!
They've sacked the village, taking women to the boats now!
RAIDER: Peasant pigs!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Charge!
Norman! Norman!
Father!
- De la Cruex!
- You.
CHRYSAGON: Frisian butcher!
I warn you...
Aah!
You are bloodied, Chrysagon.
I had him, Draco.
I had him in my fist, and I lost him.,
There's no one else worth ransom?
There's only one prince of the Frisians.
So, they bring their heathen brats along to show them murder.
Here's your lesson, boy.
Hold your hand, Bors.
Let me have him.
Why?
I'll make a page of him, and being a page, he'll make a lord of me.
He will sting you with this.
Where would such a scurvy ship's boy steal such a blade?
You the village elder?
My name Odins, and this is my son Marc.
You took that from a Frisian?
Aye, Lord. I fought.
Where are the men of the garrison?
- Gone, Lord.
- What do you mean, gone? Killed?
- I mean gone.
- And the warden? Dead?
Last night I saw him very much alive.
Methinks we've got a seigneur instead of a warden in a tower.
What difference?
- This'n saved thee.
- This'n can also hang thee.
- So could Tava.
- This'n has the right.
But he's a great knight.
20 years in the wars, the priest said.
Our lord he is.
Our lord, perhaps, but not our master.
Nor master of the stone, nor the tree.
- Milord?
- Good father.
Sir Chrysagon de la Cruex?
Hugo de Bouillion, Milord.
Servant of God.
My, uh, my flock, Sire.
Your vassals.
A simple people, but pious in their fashion.
They were druids here before Caesar's day.
Mere children who revered, in all innocence, the customs of their fathers before them.
Customs of the devil, sir priest.
Not so, good sire.
Not so? To think such faceless brutes could sway a priest.
Oh, they have faces.
The all look much alike to me.
CHRYSAGON: That doorway has no protection.
No protection at all.
It stinks.
CHRYSAGON:
You could find it blindfolded.
PRIEST: The raiders...
CHRYSAGON: It stank before the raiders came.
My men marched 20 miles today.
Now they must sleep in this.
PRIEST: Milord, when the Duke's messenger told our warden of... his removal, he grew somewhat lax.
CHRYSAGON: I knew him in court.
He was somewhat lax then.
A little... disordered, I fear.
CHRYSAGON: Where is he now, your lax warden?
It is to be hoped in Heaven, but I doubt it.
Your quarters, Milord.
[Bird squawks]
He was always chasing some goose girl up a hayrick.
He was bewitched.
Carried off by devils, he was.
These people here have ancient customs... in which he may unthinkingly have joined.
The tree and the stone?
Worshipping the devil?
PRIEST: No. He damned the devil's flesh, but women's flesh he loved, and devils dearly love to masquerade.
Priest... are you saying she was a witch?
Witch?
White flowers.
What is this?
PRIEST: Her bridal wreath.
Come, Sir Priest.
Was she a witch or a bride?
A virgin bride.
The warden's?
A villager's.
God's grace.
Bee among the flowers.
The mark of death.
[Screech]
There must be willing girls in this place enough for any man.
Why took he a virgin?
"Keep their good will," the Duke told me.
Him before me, this rapacious bastard.
Small loss when the Frisians killed him.
Milord, it was not rape.
They liked the warden well.
- Who liked him?
- These people here.
In olden times, they sanctified a marriage... by giving the bride on her wedding night...
Bors, burn that bed.
Devils... devils.
PRIEST: Yes, yes.
Our fens and marshes attract them in great quantity. l, with these eyes, have seen them.
I speak of different devils.
The Frisians.
Oh, yes, yes, Lord.
Might I offer you some meager food and drink?
- They'll be back.
- I daresay, Lord.
Their land lies North across the sea but two days distance.
- I cannot...
- I know where their land lies.
PRIEST: And they do raid our coast this time of year.
I have a green cheese...
Next time I'll hold him fast...
Two fishes, a garlic soup... as he held my father.
Father?
Taken in battle by Frisians,
I've been told.
And stripped bare.
Most extortionate ransom.
They are a harsh people.
He came home broken, and died so. A pauper knight.
It must be hard to lose your lands, I'm sure.
We lost all.
It was a long time ago.
A lifetime.
What were you saying?
- I said...
- Tell me at table.
We'll gnaw bone tonight and hunt tomorrow.
Thank you, Milord.
You'll enjoy our forest.
There's deer, wild fowl, and tusky boar.
[Woman screams]
Down, dogs! Down!
Down dogs! Get off! Get off!
Be still, woman.
They won't hurt you. Get off!
She's all right.
Counts as a kill, though.
Come on, pig girl.
It's never as bad as all that.
Pig girl? No eyes in your head, man?
WOMAN: Aah!
Here's the pelt, and there's the otter!
I told you I want no trouble with these people.
Handle them softly, I said.
Just what I was going to do, Milord.
You are out to hunt, dog.
Get on with it!
All of you!
[Dogs barking]
Are you hurt?
Ah, nothing much.
Say your name.
Bronwyn, Milord.
From the village?
I own the village.
I know, Milord.
What house?
Odins, Milord. The elder.
- His foster child.
- Speak up, girl!
May I dress myself, Milord?
Yes.
Are you going to watch me?
Yes.
- Are you cold?
- No.
- You afraid?
- Yes.
Why? I'm gentle with horses, hawks.
Come here.
Come here.
[Bee buzzes]
- What is this?
- A wedding garland.
And you're a virgin?
MAN: Bronwyn.
What happened to you?
He did nothing.
A bee stung him.
He?
I fell in the water.
And he did nothing?
- They were hunting.
- Who?
Lord Chrysagon.
And he did not touch you?
Am I hurting you by asking these questions?
Then why do you weep?
Marc, I love you.
I have since your father took me in.
Stay away from him.
Yes, Marc.
Stay away from him!
[Bird chirping]
[Laughter]
God's great fist, I can see him.
Milord and brother.
Planting himself in front of her and staring her down.
Giving her battle orders.
You go, wheel around.
Keep your flanks covered, pull up your breastplate.
Your rear echelon's exposed!
[Laughter stops]
BORS:
You haven't removed your shirt.
That's why the wound frets you.
CHRYSAGON: Frets me?
You fret me like an old woman.
Told you it's a scratch, nothing more.
Fester, then, in flame.
DRACO: You have a fever, Brother?
Can't sleep.
Maybe you took it from that girl at the pond.
DRACO: What's she like?
Oh, I don't know.
A woman, tan hair, breasts, belly, legs.
A woman.
She has a calm face.
So has a cow.
How was she?
I let her go.
You let her go?
Small wonder you can't sleep. Why?
There's a strangeness in this place.
I felt it since first we came here.
Nonetheless,
I thought, mine.
Poor place.
Marsh, naked tower, the world's end, almost.
But to have it, to hold it...
If only...
What do you think of this land?
Dung heap.
You deserve better... much better.
What say you, Bors?
You are my lord.
This land serves you,
I serve you.
But if it should be a land unholy?
Here.
Do you feel nothing, hear nothing, see nothing?
I feel bored.
I hear the wind.
I see fever burning holes in your head.
Silence.
That speaks of spells.
BOORS: Ah...
DRACO: Bors?
Sire, all men have heard how when the Lord Christ came, the old Gods, demons, and spirits with snaky hair... were cast down into hell.
Good riddance!
But some say they still linger, prowling the dark corners and unblessed places of the earth, changed to beggar men and goose girls.
Bors, you surprise me.
You've produced a thought.
BORS: God help the man who meets one.
The blood in his heart changes.
And what of that devil's dish he met today?
She's the cause of his fever, and that's the truth.
- How so?
- Because you let her go.
DRACO: Bors... you know who she is?
Find out from Rainault, put her to work in the kitchen.
[Grumbles]
Why waste her charm on pigs when there's use for it here?
Oink! Ha ha!
[Man groans]
[Horse neighs]
BORS: Come here!
[Door squeaks shut]
BORS: Now, girl... you will take his arms and hold him firm while I...
Lie flat, Milord.
Here!
You will hold him here and here.
He will plunge like a gelded colt.
I did.
Take him.
BORS: A trick I learned from a heathen Moor.
If a wench holds him, he doesn't kick.
Pride of manhood, I suppose.
Take 10 men to hold Milord... or one woman.
Sire, I shall count to five.
[Sizzling]
One... two... three... four... five.
[Door shuts]
[Bird squawking]
[Falcon chirps]
[Bird squawks]
DRACO: Volc, call him down here.
Damned falcon never knows what he wants.
VOLC: They're human that way.
DRACO: You know less about falcons than a flea.
To train a falcon, you need a larger brain than a falcon.
VOLC: Come down here or I'll wring your neck.
Damn me, but just look at Sir Flea bristle.
[Horse neighs]
[Volc laughing]
I'll kill him.
I'll kill them both!
I'll twist your nose with the slack in your belly.
I'm sorry.
CHRYSAGON: Draco, Draco...
Draco! Draco!
[Horse neighs]
Ya!
[Horse neighs]
[Horse grunts]
Don't run from me.
- Is that poppy?
- Yes.
What do you want with this?
We call it hawk's eye.
We get chamomile from it for seasoning.
It also has the power to rob men's minds.
Like magic.
- And it can kill.
- Oh, no magic.
My foster father heals with these herbs.
- Purple foxglove.
- For lovesickness.
Three leaves or four can stop the heart.
- Witchery.
- No, Milord.
Not witchery.
They all kill.
What's that?
Mistletoe, the golden bow that twines around the sacred oak.
Why is the oak sacred?
It's connected to the gods.
- You believe that?
- Yes.
Before I came, they told me that... marsh people had spotted bellies and webbed toes.
- You believe that?
- Not since I saw you... in the lake.
CHRYSAGON:
We'll lie under that tree.
- No.
- I feel good about you.
I've been fighting all year.
I haven't had time to lie under trees.
- Let me go.
- I fought last year, too.
I haven't even seen a girl with tan hair.
I'm tired of fighting.
- Milord, l...
- Shh. Don't talk, Witch.
Have pity.
[Birds squawk]
[Wings flapping]
This is not lawful.
DRACO: You want to serve in this troop? Ha! Ha!
I want to be Milord's man.
People of your tribe cannot bear arms.
Besides, you have no skill with weapons.
RAINAULT: I found poachers in the glen, sire.
PRIEST: They are not poachers, Milord.
DRACO:
With a pair of stags, Rainault.
DRACO: You said two.
RAINAULT: Yes, sire.
These stags were dead already, Milord,
Iocked together by the horns.
They needed the meat, surely.
The Frisians slaughtered most of the livestock.
That be truth.
Frisians killed our pigs.
DRACO: And so they poach.
Woodlands belong to the lord.
They should carry the stump of the right hand in the left.
The woodland belongs to the duke.
We keep it for him.
We keep the peace here, too.
CHRYSAGON: We share
Lord Draco's outrage.
To kill the duke's deer is a great crime.
- But there is no proof.
- Proof?
- It is my opinion...
- L, too, hold opinions!
- I am a knight!
- I can write letters!
- The devil's tools!
- Enough!
Beware, Milord.
Another time, your compassion might be mistaken for weakness.
There will not be another time.
You, Volc!
What are you doing with that boy?
Why, training him, sire.
It's the only way.
Keep to the tower now, boy.
BORS: Lord!
BORS: Milord has spent the morning on you.
Don't waste his time.
MAN: I speak for my son, Marc, who humbly beseeches our lord's grace... and consent to wed.
To this girl?
The foster daughter of my house, called Bronwyn.
When?
- Tomorrow, Milord.
- So soon?
They've been promised since childhood.
It's time, Lord.
I give leave to your son to wed.
MAN: We thank thee.
Work on the moat goes well, but the drawbridge...
Blacksmith here says to tell you...
No more now!
Get him out!
Ah!
[Thunder]
[Dogs whine and bark]
Bones of the saints!
What's wrong with you?
- Is it the wench?
- Draco, enough!
I'm only saying, if you want her, take her.
- I told you...
- It's not my business.
You don't eye a woman every day.
CHRYSAGON: She marries tomorrow.
Why not tonight?
She's not a she-goat, Draco.
I won't take a woman the night before her wedding.
You're right.
It's wrong tonight.
I could bite my tongue.
What about tomorrow?
Get... what's his name, the priest.
DRACO: Sir pri-iest!
You have the right.
The wedding's tomorrow...
The right of the first night.
Ask the priest.
Of the seven golden virtues, I swear, the most peculiar is chastity.
Look, you're the lord of this place.
She belongs to this place.
Therefore, she's yours.
Ask him.
DRACO: Dear learned priest, we need your counsel.
PRIEST: Such as I have to give.
DRACO: Are you well-versed in church law, father?
Middling well, though my order runs not to law.
It seeks rather to make amends... for the evils wrought by men through the absence of love.
Splendid. It is of love that I would ask you.
DRACO: Now... this noble knight has need of innocent pleasure.
There is no such thing as innocent pleasure.
Priest, scholar, certainly you have heard... of the right of the seigneur... to take a virgin bride on her wedding night.
The church does not admit it.
- It is pagan law.
- These are pagan lands.
Not of a Sunday morning,
I assure you.
These are evening matters.
We found the warden with a bride in his arms.
Was she not freely given by her people?
The warden...
DRACO: What do they say in Rome?
Juste primi noctes.
That being the Roman for it.
You hear that?
It's known in Rome.
And damned as heresy.
And yet...
- And yet...
- Speak on, good father.
Well, now, fertility.
Some say it's pagan.
But who's not pagan in some matters?
True, true!
I love the speech of scholars.
Young folks think only of frolicking.
Desist, I tell them.
But they will go a-wantoning.
So, lest the devil take them,
I preach them a text from Holy Writ.
"Increase and multiply,"
I say,
"replenish the Earth."
And oh, how they obey me.
But how this touches on your problem...
Oh, clearly, clearly!
The pagan part may honor pagan law.
We ask no more.
What hour's the wedding?
The wedding in church or t'other?
What other?
We'll be at the church.
To claim that right?
War lords, forebear!
In this weak hand lie lightnings, and I use them.
- Ah, no, no sacrilege.
- Not in God's church.
I dare say, there's another wedding... their tribal way.
That wedding's theirs.
Feasting, drinking, clowning, dancing...
Oh, Lords, how they do caper.
Aar!
[Speaking foreign language]
[Revelry stops]
Hold the boy.
ODINS: You come to do us honor, Milord.
To claim my right.
[People mumbling]
- He has the right.
- No!
BORS: Silence!
- No!
- Let it be, my own son.
ODINS: He has the right.
Not by his law, but by ours.
Ours.
Long before the Norman came, with his church and his tower, we worshipped at the stone and tree.
And in the fields, we plant holy seeds.
Then, as now, a virgin sacrifice... was made for the fertility of our earth... and the enrichment of our tribe.
To take her your way is rape.
It should be done our way... the old way.
You accept this?
With a ring of fire.
The sacred way of the Druids.
You accept this?
I do.
Prepare then a high place.
I have a high place.
Make it ready... and your men wearing iron.
Wearing iron, Norman lord, and standing.
As the moon rises, the virgin bride... shall be brought to you.
ODINS: But hold!
At the rising of the sun,
I will reclaim her.
So be it.
[Whispers a prayer]
ODINS: I go to wait the rising of the sun.
You weep?
- No, be still.
- Yes, Milord.
Milord. Milord speaks and all obey.
Is that not what you want?
I want you to be free to go or stay as you will.
But I fear you'd go, so...
Look at me!
I have the right to take you.
I have the right.
You want me to go?
Go... back to your pigs, your strange, damn people, your death-sucking bees, yes!
Go, and let me go.
Go!
Wait.
I want...
I need you as I need breath... sunshine, fire in winter.
Bother...
That's what festers.
I want my life in you.
It's truth.
It goes beyond the blood, fever, and the flesh.
It's sacred for a highborn man to begin your life.
BRONWYN: Are you afraid of me?
I cast no spells.
CHRYSAGON: Better if you did.
Spells can be broken.
Milord, l, too, am bewitched.
You. You had them hold me!
ODINS: Or see you cut to pieces.
MARC: Better that!
MAN: And all the rest of us?
He's got my wife.
He's touching her.
My God, he's touching my wife!
Bear it, my son.
Slaves have no sons!
Who took my mother from you, coward?
Who's my father?
Toughen up your heart.
If she'd been gored by an ox, you'd tend her.
Try and forget the pain.
Who knows her better than you?
She's yours.
Since she was little, it was always Marc.
I couldn't sleep.
It's cold out there.
I feel rheumaticky.
DRACO: Good Father... you have pointy ears... you have sneaky eyes... eyes that lie in your stomach.
I couldn't sleep either.
We are all of us, good Father, made of the coarsest clay.
You, me, my stern and glorious brother up there in bed... though I'm sure he isn't sleeping.
I wonder whether the louse wasn't created... on the sixth day with man.
You, too, are a party to it.
And undeserving of the frock I wear.
But you see, Milord, l, too, am a man... and a louse.
Stand to attention!
You are a guard of honor!
The sun... like every other day.
You cried out last night.
I put my fingers to your lips, and you slept again.
I dreamt of my father.
He died when he came home and found his lands sold for ransom.
And I took up arms for the Duke.
He died in two halves.
First his right side, then his left.
He had me set my hands between his... dead hand and his live one and swear to keep his faith with the Duke.
I swore to protect my brother, to recover our lands...
But he was already dead.
From under his right hand,
I took that sword.
I've lived 20 years with that cold wife.
And off his dead finger,
I took this ring.
What are you doing?
Milord, it's dawn.
CHRYSAGON: They won't take you.
Not the Duke, nor the devil, nor all...
It could never, never be.
[Thud]
[Thud]
It's daylight in the swamps... or did you notice?
You look as though your fever's gone.
The elder... what's his name,
Odins... waits for her below.
Don't you hear me, Chrysagon?
It's over now.
I'll talk to him.
That old clown? Let him howl.
But there was an understanding with the Duke.
You've forgotten?
"Keep their good will," he said.
I'll not give her up.
I can't.
First, you run stallion-mad and trample our lives to pieces...
My life is my own.
Dear lord and brother, you are the Duke's most favorite jewel, his cosset.
Through you, comes everything.
All we have, and we must have something!
You've had the grain out of my horse's mouth, new armor that should have clothed my men.
Their blood paid for your fineries!
CHRYSAGON: My blood, too.
Bounty from the wars, each favor of the Duke,
I gave to you, all to you, wantoning at court, while I sweated inside that damn, dirty armor 20 years!
I've had nothing.
Nothing! Nothing!
You are our lord!
You cannot be a slave of a slave!
It sets the whole world turvy!
[Kicks door]
And look at her, this flower face, the sister of pigs!
This blazing whore.
That naked strumpet wears our father's ring!
Then honor it... and her!
She is mine.
You are bewitched.
You've had her... now keep her.
And may your soul be damned for it.
ODINS: Where is she?
He speaks of love, the sort of thing that songs are made of.
ODINS: Well?
He's not yet tired of his toy.
I must see Lord Chrysagon.
Don't ever touch me1
BORS: What are you waiting for?
Can't you see it's over?
Where is she?
Father... what I said last night... I'm sorry.
He had the right.
But now I have her back, l...
He keeps her!
No! Don't tell me of his rights!
He has none. Not now.
What can you do?
Do you want to be cut down?
They are warriors, boy.
You won't get by the door!
MARC: I have a sickle.
I killed a boar in the marsh.
I can kill a horse and a man.
ODINS; You'll never kill him, boy.
Killing's his trade; he was born to it.
MARC: I'll sink my sickle in his chest like a hook in beef.
I liked him.
You know that I liked him?
Norman or no, he seemed a man.
I'd have served him.
I raged last night.
I thought, "Well, he's higher than I am, better."
And she...
I'll strangle him in his own stinking guts.
But not alone.
Hark to what I told you.
Go over the water to the Frisians.
Take the boat in the fen, bring them back with you.
Why should they help us?
Because this half-sized Norman says they will?
No, you ditch dog... for the boy I told you of, the boy I took.
He's a prince of those people.
If they know he's in that tower, they'll take it down stone by stone to have him back.
A Frisian prince?
He told you that?
These did.
Take that to them.
I'll keep this to be a lord in.
ODINS: Go then, my son.
It can't be mended without blood.
I'll be back within the week.
She'll escape him somehow, no matter how close he keeps her.
Old woman, take it in.
[Thunder]
Where are the men from the village to work in the moat?
None came today, Lord.
Yesterday, only two.
The village elder,
I haven't seen him...
[Thunder]
[Falcon cries]
[Falcon cries]
CHRYSAGON: It's cold.
My love, you're shivering.
Do you know the stars?
CHRYSAGON: My father taught me to find my way by them.
I know only this village.
An now, only this tower.
CHRYSAGON:
Do you want to go back?
I can't leave you.
CHRYSAGON: I know.
Worlds wider than this tower,
I do know that road.
There's a place, a far place where I can carry you.
When?
Please? When?
CHRYSAGON: When all's done here.
I must hold this place awhile yet... for the Duke.
[Dogs barking]
The Frisians. They're back.
[Ring]
[Dogs bark]
[Horses whinny]
CHRYSAGON:
Tybald, get water to the roof.
Break some stones from the parapet.
BORS: Away!
MAN: War lord!
War lord!
The boy... or we cut your Norman throats!
Has the whole village joined them?
Nearly all, I fear, Milord,
God save their souls.
Isn't that your falconer, the little man?
Volc, too.
DRACO: So, Sir Flea has deserted us.
Oh, well.
Small loss, eh, Brother?
MAN: War lord!
The boy! My son!
DRACO: Your son, is he?
You gave my father back for a bucketful of gold pieces.
The same for your son, then, or take him without his head!
Can you put enough edge on that to cut your way out of this?
Oh, I know we're all safe in your strong hand... and do but trust in you and all will yet be well, huh?
Lie here with your wench, then,
Sir Chrysagon de la Cruex... until those pirates pull the Duke's tower into the swamp.
Draco, what would you do if you break the Duke's faith...
I break his faith?
You're the lord of this place.
"Hold it well," he told you.
And where are the dogs you hold it for?
Waiting outside your door with pitchforks.
- But you...
- What, Brother?
DRACO: Will you chop me with this great sword?
Well, it might be.
You're a tall, strong man.
Or I might chop you.
Neither way would make you right.
Now! Open it!
My brother's ridden for help... to the Duke.
It's ready!
Bow the tower doors.
Now!
We need a grappling hook.
BORS: There is none.
Milord!
BORS: The boat!
It could have an anchor.
Get me a rope!
Take a turn around that post.
- Not you, Bors.
- Why not?
I would as soon die a wet death as a dry one.
[Banging on door]
Steady.
Pull!
BORS: Hold! Hold!
BORS: Pull!
Pull, your heathen guts!
PRIEST: Will help soon come from Ghent?
Help?
Aye, if the Duke wills it'll come, soon or late.
But... but will it be in time?
Ha! Look, ye priest... if they rise early, move fast, and find us alive, then it will be in time.
Hmm!
CHRYSAGON: Up now.
Come on. Up!
Get ready.
Water!
CHRYSAGON:
It's no use. We'll go below.
Barricade the stairs!
If they overrun us down here...
[Pounding on door]
The horses!
Hah! Hah!
- Pour the oil!
- Oil!
CHRYSAGON: Block that doorway.
They haven't finished.
[Caw Caw]
CHRYSAGON: Tybald... sound the bell.
[Ring]
Now!
Go!
BORS: It's Draco with thunder!
PRIEST: Milord!
Ha Ha Ha!
Lord Draco.
DRACO: Hmm.
CHRYSAGON: Draco!
Our savior.
Oh, not yet. Those wild men are still in the woods.
They won't leave while we hold the boy.
DRACO: The can't take him now... so they must buy him.
Our dearest Duke gave me more than the men I saved you with.
He promised me half the gold our captive princeling brings.
Ransom?
Ho ho ho!
So the world turns, Brother.
As his father held ours, so we hold him.
We could sell him a pound at a time.
Mmm. Pity he's so small.
Well, any ear should do to show we are honest traders.
CHRYSAGON: Draco, let be.
I've had a bellyful of blood over this.
"Let be," is it?
Oh, no, Brother.
My glorious brother, no more.
The Duke's had a bellyful, too.
When I told him of the devil's brew you stirred up, he gave me your holding here.
Did I say it was a turning world?
You are lord here?
I am.
That little insect is mine to kill, maim, ransom as I see fit.
This village is mine.
As for the clods in it... they'll find what rebellion brings.
I'll give them empty sleeves and wooden legs...
- For what I did?
- Lf you like, Brother.
Carry it all on your broad back, your sins and mine.
Carry them to a monkery and pray your way to God's grace.
Or go to hell.
I've been there.
Then go on a quest for the Holy
Grail, and take that with you.
But first, my father's ring.
- The ring, I say!
- Draco!
Shall I take her finger with it?
I can't fight you, Draco.
Then I'll fight you.
Ahh!
Why?
While I ate the bread you earned in the wars... and rode the horse you gave me... and lived in the shadow of your sickening righteousness... because the Duke smiled on you...
Well, he's not smiling now.
Now I hold this place!
And you'll all swear your fealty to me.
Not while Milord lives.
Then your lord shall die.
This thing must be settled.
Draco.
I swear to you, Draco.
I swear by my father's...
Ring!
If you prefer butchery to combat, then butchery it shall be.
Draco!
My glorious brother...
Draco.
[Crash]
Come, boy.
Keep her with you... here.
Milady.
[Sounds horn]
[Frisians whooping and hollering]
Wait! Hold!
[Cheering]
For this gift of my son,
I'll give you all I can... rank, riches, land.
Cross the water with us.
No.
Why "no"?
Go with him.
You and she get clear of this mess.
I can't give up this place.
This place is no longer yours to give up.
It was Draco's for a moment.
The Duke will send another lord... to do what Draco promised, and what will you do to save her then?
Kill him... and then the next?
And then the Duke himself?
If you'd give mi... milady sanctuary...
FRISIAN: My roof is hers.
CHRYSAGON: I'll bring her.
BORS: You send her to the Frisians.
Such fierce nobility, hmm?
And then what?
CHRYSAGON: I go to the Duke.
BORS: The Duke?
Why, to make ghosts of us?
CHRYSAGON: To put what right all I've set wrong here.
BORS:
You talk like a ballad singer.
Do penance?
Plead for these marsh rabbits?
The Duke will have your head on a pole and mine along with it.
CHRYSAGON: Don't go, then, Bors.
You get free of this.
Your father sent me to ride at your back... when you were too small to reach the saddle.
God help me, I've ridden too many miles there to leave now.
Bronwyn!
[Horse whinnies]
Bronwyn!
Listen to me.
I can't take you to that... that far place.
Not for a while.
I'll be with you... always, wherever you go.
So you go now to the North.
No! I want to stay with you.
CHRYSAGON: No, you can't.
I have to stay here.
If you go, I go, too.
You stand up... now... and go, and we both go.
Oh, Bors. I'm tired.
I hurt.
Rainault!
Hold this place till... till I come back.
You hold it well.
THE WOLF WOMAN
- Professor Fernández.
- Yeah.
Come in.
- Dr. Bernstein!
- Prof. Fernández!
- Are you surprised to see me?
- Pleasantly surprised.
Why don't you sent me a letter saying you would come?
I decided to come at the last minute.
I had no time to warn you.
Come in.
Come in, please.
Are you returning from some medical congress?
I'm so far away from everything that I don't know anything of what's happening outside.
No. I came exclusively to talk to you.
- With me?
- Yes, professor.
- Do you have any trouble?
- No.
I came to ask you the hand of your daughter Clarissa.
Our relationship began when you was in Europe.
We decided to keep our love in secret, but...
I love her, and I came here to ask her to marry me.
- What about her?
- She wrote me, giving in to my requests.
I'm sure you would accept it.
- Are you upset, sir?
- No, no!
It was something so unexpected that...
Will you spend a few days with us,
I suppose?
Yes, of course.
It needs to reflect on those decisions.
- Such precipitation would be dangerous.
- Dangerous?
Dangerous for happiness, of course.
Who could have killed them?
I don't understand. They opened the chest and tore the heart.
It's disgusting!
Any conclusions, doctor?
Well, these two are with open chest... and the third one has deep wounds... if someone tried to tear your heart as well.
Maybe the killer had not time, or something.
Maybe.
He tried to defend himself when it was attacked or tried to escape!
What the hell could have happened?
Why don't you stay here?
We would work together.
You could continue with your research here.
And your presence would be helpful in my studies about... metaplasia.
There's blood here.
Certainly she dug her nails into the body of her attacker and bled it.
With a sample of this blood we shall know who or what attacked them.
But how?
Each species has a different type of blood.
Examining at the microscope we shall know... what scale its logic belongs.
- We'll have to send it to the city?
- Oh, no.
In the Prof. Fernandez's lab we can do it.
Here we have a witness that may determinate the killer.
A sample of his own blood.
This microscope is one of the best that's available.
Look.
An authentic operating room.
I use it in interventions in small invertebrates.
As you can see, I got the best and most modern equipment.
Oh, and the most important thing!
This door.
I call it chamber of miracles.
And this is the result of my job.
All these beings are alive.
They were sharply frozen... suspending the cellular process and leaving it static.
Opting for the disintegration of life.
We couldn't say they're sleeping.
Their lives are in my hands.
But I could thaw them I return them back to life, if I want.
Could you tell me what kind of studies I'm doing, Dr. Bernstein?
No.
Mutations of nature.
The metamorphosis of the cells.
They're all equal and all succeed themselves.
[Translation missing] and others, something different, like a moth?
Knowing the answer, I could tell why a living being... can become another one completely distinctive to its species.
So distinct as...
Let's say...
A wolf.
Who's there?
It's me, Mom.
Open the door!
Full moon?
And what's the relation with the studies you've been performing?
So many.
The influence of the moon exerts great power over the cellular activity.
And that's when you can appreciate... the mystery of its wonderful job.
Here are all the notes about my experiments.
Any problem?
No problem, Sir.
You can rest now.
What a strange guy.
Who is he?
Crumba.
He's like a watchdog.
A gypsy who camped around here.
Once I saved his life and now he has a debt with me.
A dream?
In fact, a nightmare.
It's horrible.
It happens almost every night.
I get out of my bed and I can't sleep anymore.
What you dream about?
I'm running through the woods... at night...
I feel that someone comes and I hide myself.
Someone is after me.
I feel an uncontrollable rage.
I go out and...
Everything becomes confused.
I see my hands full of blood.
- I don't know, that's why I ignore it!
- But I have to know!
- Is it something related to my dream?
- Please!
Why do you keep me and my sister locked up?
- Say it!
- It's your father's orders.
I can't stand this situation!
It has to be some reason!
If your father order it,
I have to obey.
You know him.
Never give explanations to anyone.
It's ok.
But it seems instead of a house, we live in a prison!
- What's the problem? It's her again?
- Leave me alone!
[Missing translation]
- She is crazy.
- Don't talk about your sister like that.
Dr. Bernstein is downstairs with your father.
Alejandro!
- I thought you wouldn't come.
- Yeah, I was just a little late.
Metaplasia. The transformation of a tissue to another.
Isn't amazing?
Yes, it's fascinating.
I must confess that I'm studying something similar.
Also breaks with all scientific conventions.
- Lycanthropy?
- Yes.
The transformation of a man into a wolf.
Or a woman in wolf.
Science denies the existence of the lycanthropy.
Conceptualizes it as something unreal.
- Do you have the same opinion?
- No.
Because I have powerful reasons to believe it.
It goes much further than a mere study about a disease.
Disease?
No, professor.
The lycanthropy goes far beyond the pathological concepts.
Science never could explain it... because this is a mystery that only I could decipher.
- Can we talk privately?
- Of course. You can go.
Prepare the guest room.
Dr. Bernstein will stay a few days with us.
And why did he come?
- To ask the hand of Clarissa.
- Oh, no!
My God!
Nothing is impossible.
You see?
I am here with you.
I'm afraid.
- Afraid of what?
- To awaken her.
It's not illusion, Clarissa.
It's reality.
Look at me.
It was exactly what I dreamed.
You came for me.
You was kissing me, but... suddenly, everything becomes confused and... and you're no longer with me... and something falls before my eyes...
There is nothing to fear.
Take me with you.
I am prisoner of my father here.
Locked up in my room every time it's full moon.
I not even dare to complain.
Soon all this will be over.
Stop torturing yourself.
B-O-N-E.
Very good.
You was really good.
I think it's enough for today.
How can I thank you, Miss?
- Do you think it's worth?
- She's a very intelligent girl.
She learned the whole alphabet in a week.
She will be able to hear again?
Or speak at least a little?
She already feels vibrations in her throat.
We must be patient.
She have to lose the stiffness of her vocal cords.
And when it happens, she will speak.
In the end, it's always the same.
To die.
But not even those who died can escape from its destiny.
The life of a mortal one realizes time only in an instant.
Because after death, comes the eternity.
The region without dimensions.
Infinite in time and space.
Reaching it is the most important.
It's there where our love will last forever.
Life will soon pass.
- Good night, Clarissa.
- Good night.
- Who is he?
- It's Dr. Gonzalez.
- A doctor?
- Yes. A friend of my father.
And what he's been doing here at this hour?
Sometimes they work until dawn.
A few hours ago, one of my best friends was killed.
That's why I couldn't come.
Why are you trembling?
The night scares me,
I can't help it.
Take it easy.
We've talked about it.
You don't have to be afraid.
I need to talk to you... where no one can hear us.
Why can't you tell me now?
Tomorrow.
I'll be waiting for you, my love.
Three deaths?
Yes, I have samples of their blood.
I need to check on Herschel scale what zoological species it belongs.
Only one of them managed to save from mutilation.
My God!
- I don't understand.
- What's happening?
I already went over all kinds of blood from Herschel's scale...
And there's nothing equal to the sample have you got?
That's righit.
- Is it human blood?
- Neither.
Do you want to confirm?
Notice how the crystals change their shape.
I need you to understand me clearly.
This marriage will not take place!
Did you hear me?
My decision is definitive.
Listen, Professor. When I give a step, I never turn back.
I will marry Clarissa and it's also definitive.
About this marriage...
What you intend to do?
When Clarissa be my wife,
I will decide our lives.
Your lives?
Today three people has been killed.
Murdered by a lycanthrope.
Go!
I've been attacked... by a lycanthrope...
A lycanthrope...
Everything will depend on his physical resistance.
There's nothing else we can do.
He will die?
Will depend of his organic recovery.
It's something that takes time and... and he just left a few minutes of life.
- I can do it.
- What?
Canceling the cells and vital organs... preventing the tissue's decomposition.
How?
Freezing the body until his recovery.
I've done with diseased plants and
I have relived smaller animals before.
I take the responsibility.
Come on, give me a hand.
Let's get out of here.
It's dangerous.
The temperature can drop quickly.
I have good news, inspector.
In the evening, we capture the killers.
Two?
- Two?
- Yes, a man and a beast.
We found them wandering through the woods.
Come please.
These are the killers.
Beware of the dog, it's a beast.
Jack?
Jack likes to make friends.
Don't trust them, inspector.
Dogs are not hypocrites like men!
If he demonstrate confidence... that's what it is.
Beautiful dog.
Since when you have it?
Since I was a kid, sir.
Where you are from?
From very distant lands.
On the other side of the sea.
I was born in a small village.
It's not even on the map.
And what are you doing here?
It is a crime a man take his dog to take a ride?
What's meaning of this medallion?
It is a distinctive, sir.
It indicates that Jack received a special training.
This dog is a licar.
Licar?
A dog trained to fight against a lycanthrope.
- Lycanthrope?
- Lycanthrope means... werewolf!
- Means what?
- Werewolf.
It's an old superstition.
Come on.
Let me see his belongings.
This man doesn't need to steal.
Money, a map of the region, a dagger and a mute whistle.
Mute for you and me... but not for the dog.
Pay attention.
What is it?
- A knife with an ivory blade.
- An ivory blade?
What's the use for it?
I don't know.
It has something written in Latin.
Could it be translated as:
"Use it only at the time of revenge."
You see, doctor? The cells are working at their minimum function.
However still has life.
It's impressive.
No one would imagine that this frozen body is a living human being.
Something very important, doctor.
No one else should know about it.
It' a professional secret between you and me.
Okay, Professor, but... what about your wife and your daughters?
What will say when they ask about Dr. Bernstein?
- Did you see him leave?
- He is gone.
At where? When?
That's what your father told me.
He will spend a few days off.
Where are you going?
I'm going to talk to my father.
I'll ask him myself.
Wait, let me find out.
Go to your room and when
I discover something, I'll tell you.
Open the door!
Someone, please!
The only thing that calms its horrible greed... it's the heart of his victims.
That's crazy.
If a werewolf bites you and you survive...
That's enough. You're already infected by the curse.
So you too will become forever... a werewolf!
Neither steel or bullets can kill a lycanthrope.
They can only be killed... by the prey of a licar like Jack.
Or a dagger with an ivory blade.
Many people travelled the world keeping track of a human wolf... who had killed a loved one.
Until they face the beast.
And then...
There's no choice but to kill!
Or to die.
No! No, my God!
How is it possible?
You're free.
Last night, while you stay here... an old woman was killed the same manner as the others.
Come on, hurry!
The regeneration of his cells has been completed.
The Dr. Bernstein's life is in my hands more than ever.
And it's more valuable than any other human being.
- Yes, I understand.
- I'm afraid not.
[Missing translation]
When he wakes up, maybe he can tell us who or what was to blame for so many deaths.
I must go to the North.
Tomorrow I will be away, sir.
I must visit some patients.
Good night, professor.
It's me, Crumba.
- Any news, Inspector?
- None.
Could you discovered something analyzing that blood?
Anything.
- The professor is?
- Yes, he's in the laboratory.
- See you later.
- See ya.
I'm sorry to bother you, professor, but...
I feel that my duty is to be with you at least tonight.
Some fear?
I'm not so sure, but... after what happened here last night...
Respect the mourning of this house!
Clarissa...
Let me go!
Make her shut up!
Make her stop!
Come with me!
Come, please!
Why did you do this to me?
Why didn't you make her stop?
Try to understand! Everything what happened has left her disturbed!
Clarissa has no feelings!
And you let her do whatever she wants!
Alicia, you must understand!
Clarissa is sick!
Sick?
I can	't stand it anymore.
What was this?
A shout?
Adelita!
Wait!
You can be wrong!
No! I'm not!
Let him go alone.
Come with me.
Lock yourself in your room.
No, I want to be with you.
What is it?
Ivory.
And what are you going to do?
Something I should have done a long time ago.
Help me!
Clarissa!
Oh, my God!
Why?
After death, comes the region without dimensions...
where time and space are endless.
Reaching it is the most important.
This is where our love will last forever!
THE END
Manuel and Rosa...
lived in the "sertão"...
working the land...
with their own hands.
Until one day...
for better or for worse...
he entered into their lives...
San Sebastián.
He had kindness in his eyes...
and Jesus Christ in his heart.
Rosa,
I saw Saint Sebastian.
He said a miracle will save the world.
Many people were following.
All singing and praying.
Mother doesn't believe me either.
But I saw him!
He looked deep into my eyes.
It's a miracle,
Rosa, a miracle.
Rosa, on Saturday
I'll go to market.
Divide the cattle with (landowner) Moraes.
Maybe I can sell two cows... and buy a piece of land from him.
If it works out we can plant something... to harvest next year.
It's no use.
Who knows...
Times are bad.
Heaven might send us down a miracle.
Yes, Rosa... a miracle could come.
Sebastián was born in the fire...
in the month of February, announcing...
that adversity would burn the whole world.
Because he would save those who followed him...
because he was a miracle-maker Saint...
- Morning, Boss.
- Good morning.
The cows are here, but four of them are dead.
Did they drink water from the North well?
Yes sir, it was the only place.
They were bitten by snakes.
I brought twelve cows.
Maybe we could split the loss.
There's nothing to split, the dead cows were all yours.
But Mr. Moraes the cows had your brand on them.
They couldn't be mine.
I'm a poor man.
It was an accident, but it's true.
The snakes bit your cows.
Don't argue!
The law is on my side.
Excuse me, Mr. Moraes but what law?
- Are you arguing with me?
- No, sir.
But what's this law which doesn't protect what's mine?
I've already told you, you're entitled to nothing.
But Mr. Moraes...
- You can't take what's mine.
- Are you calling me a thief?
You yourself are doing so!
Now you'll learn!
My son, your mother is dead.
Not by God's hand.
By a mercenary's gun during... a fight in the backlands.
I knew it, Rosa.
You didn't believe me... but it was the hand of God led me to the Devil.
We'll have to go to Monte Santo... and ask for St. Sebastian's protection.
Come on now... we've nothing to take with us but our destiny.
It was Don Pedro Alvares Cabral who discovered Brazil.
He had his cavalry built of stone and blood.
This pilgrimage to Monte Santo... will open the gates of Heaven... to the bodies and souls of the innocent.
I have walked to more than 100 places... telling everyone that the world will end up in this drought... with fire that will sprout from the rocks to burn the world.
The lords of this land... the authorities and the farmers... they all said I was lying... and that the sun would be to blame for this disaster.
Last year I said we'd have
100 days without rain... and we had them!
Now I tell you...
On the other side of this holy mountain... there is a bountiful land.
The horses eat flowers.
Children drink milk out of the rivers.
And rocks turn into bread.
Dust becomes flour.
There's water and food, the abundance of Heaven.
And every day when the sun rises...
Jesus Christ and the
Virgin can be seen... and Saint George.
And my Saint Sebastian... his chest bristling with arrows.
We must show the authorities... the power and force of the Saint.
They removed Dom Pedro from his throne, and now try to kill those who love the Emperor.
But those who wish to save their souls... must follow me from now on... until the day when God's sign appears in the sky.
A hundred angels with their swords of fire, shall come to herald our departure, and open our way through the darkness of the backlands.
The land will become the sea and the sea the land.
A man shouldn't be another man's slave.
He must leave the land that doesn't belong to him, so that he can reach the fields of Heaven.
The poor will be rich... and will sit on the right side of God.
The rich will be poor and stand on the left side of the Devil.
We shall not be alone, because the Lord has sent down warring angel, to cut out the heads of our enemies.
I'm condemned but have courage.
I give my strength to my Saint so he can free my people.
The Lord be praised.
Do you still remember me?
I don't remember anything.
Neither the night nor the day.
We lived together.
Back on the farm.
We've been here in
Monte Santo for a long time.
You're following Sebastian and you left me behind.
I have to be alone to reach the Sacred Island.
I must leave behind wife and children.
We'll stay one year in Monte Santo... waiting for the rain of gold.
Then we'll go to an island in the middle of the sea... and we'll let the fire from the sky burn this...
Republic of disgrace, once and for all.
The Island doesn't exist.
We have it inside our souls.
If it doesn't exist... why must we search for it all our lives?
You have come to be my strength in peace and war.
You must fight for me.
The Island doesn't exist.
Yes it does.
I saw it at the bottom of the river.
Sebastian said the island doesn't exist... and that we must live in pain.
I was behind you.
I heard.
You're lying.
You and all the others are faithless and damned... but I'm going to survive and be king.
My cattle will graze in a green pasture.
That's a dream.
The earth is dry and will never bear any fruit.
Why must you be sick with hope?
Let us leave this place and make a living elsewhere... before the Army arrives... and does the same as they did in Canudos... killing men, women and children.
If there is a war...
I'll fight a thousand soldiers with Saint George's spear.
If the people of Santo die,
I'll create the island.
You shall die.
I shall die.
No one will escape.
Fate is greater than death.
There's gold in the sea beyond.
Rocks turn into bread, and horses eat flowers.
You walk in the dark.
Lost in this dry world
Under no God or Devil
There goes Antonio das Mortes
The killer of the 'cangaceiro' highwaymen.
Since Sebastian came, the church has earned nothing... from christenings and weddings.
Sebastian is dangerous to both farmers... and the church.
The Government doesn't help us.
I always said we have two laws here:
The Government law, and the law of the bullet.
I never won an election through votes.
If the strong don't unite, they'll destroy everything.
To kill a 'cangaceiro' is dangerous, but it's easy.
We all remember Canudos.
The troops came to fight Conselheiro.
We all thought it'd be child's play... and look what happened.
We mustn't let Sebastian become another Conselheiro.
Personally,
I'm not afraid of wars.
I've always lived with them.
But you know it's dangerous to interfere in holy matters.
Sebastian is a nenemy of the church.
But the people around him are Christians.
I haven't seen for myself... but apparently he can work miracles.
Well now.
Only you can do it.
We'll give you 300 contos to rid us of the beatified.
Christ drove moneylenders out of His temple with a whip.
The example is in the Gospel.
So, Antonio?
Do you accept?
300 Contos.
It's a lot of money.
It's a small price to pay to get into Hell.
The priest thinks Sebastian has a pact with the devil.
But I think he has a pact with God, too.
Then you must leave here.
Buy a farm, and live in peace for the rest of your life.
This is your penitence,
Antonio.
It is only when you commit a great crime... that you may be forgiven for the crimes you committed.
600 contos.
That's twice what they offered you before.
Tell them they can live in peace.
Sebastian is finished.
From here I can see the sea, and then the Promised Land.
God separated the earth from the sky.
But he was wrong.
When I put them back together... the island will be visible to all.
There will be happiness,
Rosa.
After the backlands, the sea!
You must choose.
Go down there.
Bring your wife and a child.
Only after Rosa's soul is washed, will you be clean.
To govern the island, to govern the island.
My wife has the devil in her!
Tomorrow golden rain will fall.
The land will become the sea... and the sea will become the land!
When we get to the island... we'll clean the souls of the sinners... with the blood of the innocent.
Godfather Sebastian!
Killer of 'cangaceiros'.
Good morning, blind man.
I am Antonio das Mortes.
They all died happy.
They were praying.
I didn't want to kill them, but I had to.
I spared just two, to tell the tale.
And Sebastian?
They killed him.
The people killed the Saint!
On the mount of Monte Santo
Only Manoel survived
By the mercy of Antonio
The killer of 'cangaceiros'
Our story continues
Now, people, pay attention
Manoel and Rosa wandered
Through the backlands
And one day they came upon
Into their lives came
Corisco
The devil Lampião.
I kept my promise to
Father Cicero.
I won't let the poor starve to death!
In the name of Lampião...
I'll avenge the walking and the dead.
It's my Saint George,
Rosa.
Forget all that,
I can't stand seeing you... suffering any longer.
It's been 3 days, that's a long time... for someone fighting a war.
Maria Bonita's body is rotting.
Worms are eating her lovely eyes.
Maria is dead but
Lampião is alive.
His flesh is no more but his spirit is still living.
His spirit is inside me, joined together with mine.
I am a two-headed
'cangaceiro'.
One on the outside, the other on the inside.
One is the killer... the other is the thinker.
We'll see whether a two-headed 'cangaceiro'... can change these backlands.
The dragon of evil swallows the people... to fatten the Republic.
But I borrowed Saint George's spear to slay the evil giant.
Here!
Here's my rifle to save the poor from starving.
Who are you stranger?
I'm a follower of Sebastian.
Where is Sebastian?
Antonio das Mortes killed him.
Filthy Republic! They killed
Sebastian and Lampião!
They killed our protector!
Captain Corisco!
May the Lord be with you!
Drive out the devils from your body.
Who is this stranger?
Drive out the devils, and go in peace.
Where is the priest of Monte Santo?
Antonio das Mortes wiped out the holy people.
Only two were spared.
The others died a long time ago.
Dead?
All dead, a long time ago.
I was so far away that
I wasn't aware of anything.
And how about Lampião?
Don't you know?
He was killed three days ago.
With Maria Bonita and his followers.
No one can imagine what it was like.
My soul is filled with sorrow.
This pain grows like the sun.
And we must stay and remember.
It happened at six o'clock in the afternoon, at Angico.
He was killed at the mouth of the night.
And Maria Bonita at the break of the dawn.
Are there any soldier nearby?
I am waiting for the signal.
I had a dream.
Today we shall die!
Die? How?
You are crazy!
When all was lost!
I saw the Devil's rifle fired twice, once in each eye.
In your eye, Lampião!
Stand aside, who would dare shoot me in the eye?
My body is protected by the Saints.
But I saw the sign.
Death is coming today at sunrise.
Here in our hideout?
Only if you did it, if you betray me I'll kill you.
The others, there, the ones who live with the Devil.
I'm going away.
My time hasn't come yet.
It is your turn.
Let's go men!
Maria!
Avoredo!
Gavião!
Let's move.
I cut off eleven heads at the traitor's farm.
Then I put them in a bag... and sent them as a gift to the police... with a note written in blood.
It was my way of showing them
I'm at war to avenge Lampião's.
But my men were frightened and walked out on me.
Now I am alone... with those two.
Those two against a thousand soldiers.
A thousand soldiers.
Captain Corisco.
I want to join your gang.
I could help this war.
I've nothing to do.
I want to avenge
Sebastian's death.
The Government and the landowners killed him.
Can you fight?
Yes, sir, I can fight.
I've done plenty of raids.
And I can ride,
I used to drive cattle.
Saint George is helping me.
I need a valiant man.
A man like myself.
You look strong.
What's your name?
Manoel.
That's a cowherd's name.
I'll give you another one.
From now on, your name is...
Satan!
Now let's get on with our war against the Government.
See?
See your bride?
Now she's gonna be a 'cangaceiro's' wife.
Satan!
Show you're a brave man.
Cut out this cuckold's manhood.
Leave this war, let's go away.
It's now or never!
Where can I go?
I have to stay, to avenge my sorrow... and do justice.
I'll kill him, Rosa.
Get up, you coward!
Kill me, captain, kill me.
What did you expect when you ran away from home?
Justice! Sebastian promised.
And wasn't I justice?
I thought so.
But can't we comply with the law without shedding blood?
When I was young...
I was chased and beaten like a dog by that man's father.
I have waited twenty years.
I've beheaded people to relieve my woes.
It's no use now.
My fate is so smeared... that all the blood in the world couldn't purge it.
You are like the angels.
If I die, go away with your woman... and spread the word that Corisco... is more dead than alive.
Lampião is dead, and I died with him.
That's why
I must stay standing... fighting to the very end.
Disrupting order.
Until the land turns into the sea
And the sea into the land
Wandering with remorse
Antonio das Mortes
Comes looking night and day
Corisco of Saint George
Comes looking night and day
Corisco of Saint George
Comes looking night and day
Who are you?
Have you forgotten my voice?
Antonio das Mortes
I've been tracking you for over a week.
I just wanted to ask you:
Where is the man
I spared in Monte Santo?
The cowherd who killed Moraes.
Remember?
Yes, sir.
Haven't heard of him in a long time.
People saw him fighting alongside Corisco last week.
Tell me the truth:
Isn't that cowherd the same one they call Satan?
And wasn't it you led him to Corisco?
I think destiny turned out well.
I couldn't drag Manoel and Rosa along with me the whole time.
The destiny of a 'cangaceiro'!
Antonio, do you see clearly ahead of you?
I see the vast backlands of
Canudos.
In these backlands, I can see the blood of Conselheiro's.
They all died fighting the Army.
In the gloom of my blindness.
I can't understand why you hunt Corisco.
No one questions me!
I must fulfill my destiny.
Without a thought nor pity.
Blind man Julio, tell me, who killed the saint at the church?
You can't ask such questions, one forgets such things.
Who killed him?
Was it Manoel?
Didn't you say the people did it?
I lied.
I couldn't believe it.
It was the hand ofjealousy.
Rosa killed Manoel's faith.
They're both doomed.
I'll kill them one way or another.
Corisco's very tired.
Don't kill Corisco either.
I'll kill him. I'll hunt him down to the end.
Is killing your way of loving your neighbor, Antonio?
Sebastian asked me that, too.
I didn't want to do it, but I had to.
I didn't slaughter those people for money.
I killed them because I can have no peace with this misery.
It's not the people's fault,
Antonio!
Some day a greater war will burn these backlands.
A great war without the fear of God or the Devil.
Maybe that war will start soon.
I who killed Sebastian will kill Corisco.
And then I'll kill myself.
Because we are of the same blood.
Antonio das Mortes is close by and told me to warn you.
Do you hear that,
Corisco?
He's near.
Let's leave!
I can only find peace in death... in Heaven, surrounded by angels.
Listen, Corisco, whoever dies is finished!
Antonio himself said your head will roll on the ground.
The Saints protect me.
I'm waiting for Antonio das
Mortes, to fight man to man... as God would against the Devil.
Corisco faces the powerful dragon.
If I die, another will be born... for no one can slay Saint
George, the Saint of the people.
And I'll die for you, captain.
Weren't Sebastian and Lampião the same?
That's blasphemy.
Don't blaspheme!
Sebastian was greater than Lampião.
Don't you dare compare them or I'll kill you.
Anthing more to say?
I'm not afraid.
We had been defeated at Razo de Catarina.
I carried Lampião on my back.
Ezequiel! Levino!
Antonio!
All your brothers are dead, Lampião.
Of your race, you alone are still alive.
The souls of your friends are wandering alone.
I broke everything and nothing has appeared.
Nor ever will!
After I kill the others,
I'll kill myself.
We only find that kind of peace in death.
I have my doubts about death, Corisco.
We wandered day and night... until we found
Sebastian... alone and hungry.
Without his sword... he was following
Jesus Christ's example.
He helped Lampião.
He tended his wounds.
He wanted him to stop thieving, so he wouldn't die.
Lampião asked for Father
Cicero's protection.
You know what Sebastian answered?
That Father Cicero was an enemy of God.
That he was God!
He wanted to take Lampião's weapons from him... and place a cross in his hands instead.
Have some respect, bastard priest!
Lampião struck, spit and kicked his face.
A man is a man when he uses his gun to change his fate.
Not a cross, Satan.
A dagger or a rifle!
Lies! Lies! Lies!
I always told you you had the wrong image of Sebastian.
Lampião was great but at times he was small.
That's a lie!
I'm afraid of dreaming of... all the lead I shot at good and bad men.
I am afraid of Hell!
I am afraid of the souls of the victims of my dagger.
I am afraid of being sad.
Of being alone like a cow lost in the desert.
I am afraid, Corisco.
I am afraid of the darkness of death.
It's true.
Dadá, go with the blindman and fetch our daughter.
Satan!
Go alone to see how many soldiers... are with
Antonio das Mortes.
They've killed our daughter.
They said she had to redeem our sins.
There's no way out.
The soldiers are blocking all the roads.
To Pernambuco, Alagoas,
Sergipe.
Antonio has all of us surrounded.
He said he'll send our heads to the President.
Sabiá! Macambira!
Go now.
You can keep the gold.
I'll face Antonio das Mortes alone.
Satan!
Are you going or staying?
It's always been against your will. Now decide.
I am too close to you now, to live.
If we get away... we're going to have a child.
Yes, a child!
I, José, shall be protected by Abraham's sword.
I, José, shall be annointed... with the milk of the Virgin Mary.
I, José, shall be baptized with the blood of Christ.
I, José, shall find shelter in Noah's Ark.
I, José, shall be locked by Saint Peter's keys.
Where no one will see me, won't hurt nor kill me.
Neither shall the blood of my body be taken from me.
Give yourself up,
Corisco!
Greater power to the people!
Excuse me, Mr. Filby!
I say...
- I say, it's outright rude of him!
- He's merely been detained.
This is such a waste of time!
If he's not coming, I have more important things to do.
Well, speak up. What is it, woman?
Well, are we or are we not invited for dinner?
Apparently we are.
- How long has he been gone?
- I'm not certain, sir. Several days.
I've hardly seen him for some time.
He never leaves the lab. He only comes in and picks at his food.
But he did tell me about dinner, and left those instructions.
Thank you, Mrs. Watchett.
- What's it say, Filby? What's wrong?
- Nothing, really.
George says that if he's not here by 8, we're to begin without him.
Oh!
Walter, what time is it?
Dinner is served, gentlemen.
Ah, first sensible thing
I've heard all evening.
This is peculiar. He's usually prompt, precise and punctual.
Oh! He's making fools of us by not showing up. It's ungentlemanly.
- To say nothing of a waste of time.
- Huh? Yes. A waste of time.
Ah, one thing I like about
George, best cellar in England.
And Mrs. Watchett is the finest cook in the world.
Yes, I think I'll drink to that.
- Good Lord! What's happened?
- I'm all right.
Some food.
A drink.
- I didn't recognize you.
- Mrs. Watchett.
Can't you speak? What happened to you?
- Leave him alone.
- It's fine.
- I've got to tell it while I remember.
- Relax. Try to relax.
You've all the time in the world.
You're right, David.
That's exactly what I have.
All the time in the world.
Since we were together five days ago... the last day of 1899.
There in that box rests the result of two years' labor.
I wanted to finish the job before the new century began.
I barely made it.
- Cheers, gentlemen.
- Marvelous, old boy.
Mm, yes, but what is it?
Well, it has to do with time.
Oh. I've always maintained that this nation... needs a reliable timepiece.
Mm, the navy needs one. Heh.
The army needs one for the artillery.
You couldn't do better, George.
That's why you've been in hiding?
Very clever of you indeed.
I don't think George is referring to a new timepiece.
No, David.
When I speak of time, I'm referring to the fourth dimension.
Go on, George.
The fourth dimension cannot be seen or felt.
If you don't mind, will you refresh me on the first three dimensions?
Oh, really, Filby. Surely they taught you something in school. Heh-heh.
Suppose you explain it, doctor.
Huh? Oh, certainly.
Heh.
For example, when I move in a line, forward or backward... that's one dimension.
When I move left or right, two dimensions.
When I move up or down... three dimensions.
For instance, that box.
That box has three dimensions: length, breadth and height.
What is the fourth dimension?
Oh, well... That's mere theory.
No one really knows if it exists.
On the contrary.
The fourth dimension is as real and true as the other three.
In fact, they couldn't exist without it.
What do you mean?
Let's take that box.
It has the first three dimensions.
- What's inside?
- I'm coming to that.
Let's consider this first.
Why do we ignore the fourth dimension?
Because we can't move within it.
We can move in the other three. Up, down, forward, sideways, backward.
But when it comes to time, we are prisoners.
Do you follow me, Bridey?
No.
George, you've given a lucid explanation, but I'm afraid I don't understand.
There are many things you don't understand, yes?
Quite a number.
Yet you don't refuse to believe in them?
- Not if I can see the proof myself.
- Good, Walter.
Gentlemen, all I'm asking you... is to witness a demonstration of movement... within the fourth dimension.
- Doctor, can I have your help?
- Certainly. Ahem.
Ah, it's beautiful!
- Remarkable.
- Very nice, George.
Fascinating.
What is it?
This is only an experimental model.
- To carry a man, I need a larger one.
- To carry a man? Where?
Into the past or into the future.
This is a time machine.
Okay, George, you've had your joke.
Tell us what this contraption is for.
I've already told you.
The larger model can carry a passenger through time.
Not through space, but through time.
If you go to the future, won't you mess things up for us?
The future's already there.
It cannot be changed.
I wonder.
That's the most important question I hope to answer.
Can man control his destiny? Can he change the shape of things to come?
If you've gone mad, I forgive you.
- But if you're wasting our time...
- No! You're here as witnesses.
- To see, not to listen.
- To see? What?
The experiment I'm about to perform.
Let me tell you how it works. The time traveler sits in the saddle.
In front are the controls.
Let's do this properly. You can spare a cigar, I trust?
Now, let us imagine that this cigar... is the time traveler.
The lever in front of him controls movement.
Forward pressure sends it into the future... backward pressure, into the past.
The harder the pressure, the faster it travels.
Our little experiment can be performed only once.
If it succeeds, I lose my model.
That's why I need witnesses.
Go ahead, George.
Ready, gentlemen?
Doctor, lend me your hand.
I'll be damned!
It worked.
- Where did it go?
- Go?
Nowhere, in the usual sense. It's still here.
But it's no longer in the present.
It's traveling through time.
To the future, to be exact.
You expect us to believe that?
Well, you just... Certainly.
- You said it hadn't really moved.
- That's correct.
Then why can't we see it?
Because we're in this room on December 31, 1899... but the model is perhaps a hundred years away by now.
This house may not be here in a hundred years.
But the time machine occupies the same space that it did... a moment before its journey.
If it's occupying the same space, why can't I feel it?
The space you're putting your hand through is today's space.
You can't put your hand into tomorrow's space.
Space doesn't change!
The same space that's here now should be here forever.
No, Philip, time changes space!
This flat ground could've been at the bottom of the sea long ago.
A million years from now, it could be the interior of a huge mountain.
If all this is true, what do you expect to do with such a contraption?
Contraption?
I intend taking a journey into the future.
Or perhaps the doctor would volunteer to go?
Mm? Hm.
Look here, George... suppose you do go off and get lost in the 50th century...
- ...how will you get back?
- That's a risk I'm ready to take.
Oh. Now, look here, George.
I don't know what you think, but we're not fools!
We're practical businessmen.
What I want to ask you is this:
Even if you had invented a time machine, what of it?
What's its use? Who'd buy it?
How much would it cost?
Have you thought of the commercial possibilities?
No, I haven't.
George... There's a war on in South Africa.
The Boers are putting up a fight. The country needs inventors like you.
I can put you in touch with the War Office.
What do you think, David?
Oh, I...
Dr. Hillyer has a good point, George.
Ah. That's more sensible. Ha.
I'll see to it right away.
Good Lord! It's time to go.
Yes, I'm sure we all have plans for tonight.
- Are you all right, George?
- Yes, I'm all right.
Coming, Bridewell?
Thanks for coming.
- Good night.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy new century, George.
- Good night.
Happy New Year!
George.
I thought I'd better stay.
You shouldn't trouble yourself. I'm all right.
No, you're not.
You've been behaving oddly for over a month.
I'll leave, once you tell me what's on your mind.
I appreciate the gesture, David.
I just want to be left alone.
You've changed, George. Enormously.
I'm sorry.
Will you answer me one question, honestly?
Yes, I'll try.
Why this preoccupation with time?
Why not?
Don't go simple on me.
The truth is, I don't much care for the time I was born into.
People aren't dying fast enough.
They call upon science to invent... new, more efficient weapons to depopulate the Earth.
And I agree with you.
I agree, but here we are and we have to make the best of it.
You may have to. I don't.
All right. Take your journey on your contraption.
What would you become?
A Greek? A Roman?
- A pharaoh?
- I prefer the future.
You're not seriously saying you can do it?
You saw the experiment, didn't you?
I saw a toy machine vanish.
I'm sure there are any number of ways of doing that trick.
Any magician could probably do it.
It wasn't a trick!
- Would you like to see the full-scale model?
- No, I would not.
I have no desire to tempt the laws of Providence.
And I don't think you should.
- It's not for man to trifle with.
- You carry on like Hillyer and Kemp.
There's something to say about their common-sense attitude.
George, I speak to you as a friend.
More. As a brother.
If that machine can do what you say it can, destroy it.
Destroy it before it destroys you!
You must have plans for New
Year's Eve. Don't let me keep you.
Mary wasn't well. We thought we'd stay home with the baby.
Why not come home with me?
You haven't seen Jamey for a while.
I'm sorry, I can't.
What's stopping you?
Well, I just want to see the old century out by myself, that's all.
Have it your way, George.
George?
Will you promise you'll not go out of the house tonight?
I promise I won't walk out the door.
David?
I'm sorry. Please don't think me unkind or unfriendly.
- Come over to dinner Friday.
- Very well.
- Fine. Bring the others with you.
- As you say, George.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, David.
- Having supper in tonight, sir?
- I don't think so.
Why don't you go and celebrate?
Thanks, but if you don't need me,
I'll turn in earlier, if I can.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
Oh, Mrs. Watchett, I invited Mr. Filby and the others to dinner Friday.
- Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett.
- Happy New Year, sir.
Happy New Year!
At first, I pushed the lever forward very slightly...
and the laboratory grew faint around me.
I stopped.
No change.
Everything exactly as before.
No! The clock said 6:31 when I started, and now it was...8:09?
And the candle, shorter by inches.
Yet by my watch, which was with me, only a few seconds had passed.
It was disconcerting to see the sun arc in less than a minute.
To see a snail race by.
Flowers flinging wide their petals to embrace the day.
The hours speeding across my sundial.
Flowers closing their eyes for the night.
It was wonderful!
Changes that normally took hours took seconds.
Dear Mrs. Watchett...
always able to suggest a tie...
but never wearing anything more stylish...
than what she's worn for years.
Yet I was traveling very slowly.
What if I went faster?
It became intoxicating.
I pushed the lever on toward even greater speed.
I gained experience in handling the machine.
I could stop for a day, an hour, or even a second to observe.
Then go ahead a year or two.
I was able to see the changing world in a series of glimpses.
Good heavens. That's a dress?
This was intriguing.
I wondered just how far women would permit this to go.
I began to grow very fond of that mannequin.
Maybe because, like me, she didn't age.
Thirteen years passed.
Fourteen, 15, 16...
Suddenly the light was gone.
What had happened?
In the year 1917, I stopped.
Filby!
Are you going to a masquerade party?
You look rather silly without your mustache.
- Were you addressing me, sir?
- It's George!
I expected a more enthusiastic greeting...
You're confusing me with my father.
Yes. There was quite a resemblance. I'm James Filby.
"Was"?
- Were you a friend of Father's?
- Yes.
Yes, I've been away.
He was killed in the war.
A year ago.
Oh.
I'm so sorry.
- And the gentleman across the street?
- Oh, the inventor chap?
He disappeared around the turn of the century.
If you're interested in that house, you can't buy it.
- You can't even get inside.
- Why?
My father was executor of the estate and refused to liquidate it.
I often chided him on that... but he believed the owner would return some day.
People hereabouts think it's haunted, but, heh-heh...
Who are you, sir?
Just a stranger who once knew your father.
Have you been at the front?
Front? What front?
Why, the war, of course.
What war?
Good heavens!
You don't know we've been at war with Germany since 1914?
I thought you'd just returned from France.
Or perhaps...
Perhaps some tea might make you feel better.
Won't you come in?
No, thank you.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yes, I'm quite all right.
Then goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Jamey.
In 1940, I began to be buffeted from side to side.
I first thought the machine had a mechanical defect.
The last time I had stopped was in 1917, 23 years ago.
The war was still waging, now in the air with flying machines.
Then I realized the truth.
This was a new war.
Uh, I decided to push on into time and see the outcome of this.
My house was hit!
The flames shot up.
Instantly, my home was gone.
I was in the open air.
The years rolled by, everything unfamiliar.
Except the, uh, heh, smile of my never-aging friend.
What was this? Weird sounds all around. What could it be?
My curiosity compelled me to stop.
At first I wondered if I was the cause of the panic.
I was soon to find out I wasn't.
Keep it moving! Shove it on!
Come on, into the shelter.
Come on, young man! Come on!
- Filby?
- The name is Mr. Filby.
- Didn't you hear the siren?
- The horrible screeching?
It wasn't constructed for its aesthetic value... but to warn young fools to get into the shelter.
- Now, come along.
- I'm perfectly comfortable here.
I've got to talk to somebody.
This is fantastic!
Your store is magnificent!
The achievements!
- The gigantic strides man has taken!
- Come along, young man!
The mushrooms will be sprouting!
Mushrooms?
You look familiar. Haven't we met somewhere before?
Indeed we have, Mr. Filby.
Right there. Many years ago.
I was sure of that... but the exact time escapes me.
It was two wars ago, 1917.
Now I recall. The chap who inquired about my father... and the house that used to stand across the way.
Oh, but no...
No, that's impossible!
You haven't changed.
You're not a day older.
And your clothes!
Don't worry, Filby. It'll take time to explain, but...
That's the last alert!
Hurry! Hurry!
- Listen, this is important.
- Look!
An atomic satellite, zeroing in.
That's important.
Come on! Come on!
- But I've got to talk to you!
- Come on!
Filby?
Filby!
Hurry! Hide till the all-clear!
But, Filby, I've got to talk to you!
The labor of centuries, gone in an instant.
Mother Earth, aroused by man's violence...
responded with volcanic violence of her own.
Only my speed through time saved me from being encased in stone.
The molten rock cooled.
I prayed...
wondering how many eons must pass...
before the wind and rain could wear away the mountain.
Darkness.
Darkness for centuries.
I wondered if there was still a war being waged above me...
if man would still exist when I saw the sun again.
The centuries rolled by.
I put my trust in time...
and waited for the rock to wear down.
I was free again!
Thousands of centuries had passed, but the Earth stayed green.
There was no winter, no wars.
Had man learned to control both the elements and himself?
I had to stop and find out.
But I'd stopped too fast.
Magnificent!
Beautiful flowers everywhere!
Natural splendor beyond compare.
The whole landscape a garden without any weeds or briars.
Trees and vines laden with fruit of strange shapes and colors.
Nature tamed completely...
and more bountiful than ever!
At last I'd found a paradise.
But it would be no paradise if it was mine alone.
Unrepaired for centuries.
Maybe unlived-in for as long.
Anybody here?
So this is man's future: to bask in the sun, bathe in the streams...
and eat the fruits of the Earth, work and hardship forgotten.
Well, and why not?
Don't just sit there! Help her!
Are you all right?
Thank you.
- Why did you?
- Why did I what?
Come after me.
Sit down.
I did it to save your life.
That doesn't seem to mean much to you, or anybody else.
It doesn't.
Twenty of your friends were watching you drown.
Not one lifted a finger to save you.
That's a very curious attitude.
A very curious world.
Uh, aren't you interested in who
I am? Where I come from?
Should I be?
Take me to somebody a little older. Somebody I can talk to.
There is no one older.
Do you mean nobody ages in this land of yours?
- Well, what's your name?
- Weena.
Weena.
How do you spell it?
- Spell?
- Spell, write. Can't you write?
Look.
Weena.
- What are your people called?
- Eloi.
Aha.
Eloi.
Come. We must go now.
- What's wrong?
- It's getting dark.
Hello.
I don't mind telling you, I'm quite hungry.
I've come a long, long way.
In my time, a berry that size... would've been big news all over the world.
Excuse me, sir.
Uh, sir?
Perhaps curiosity has died.
Perhaps courtesy too... but I've come far and I'd like to know things.
Why?
Because I shall return to my time, and my people will ask questions.
Such as:
What kind of government rules your world?
We have no government.
Well, you must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws.
Laws? There are no laws.
Where do you get food and clothing?
Doesn't anybody work?
No.
Well, where does that come from?
- It grows. It always grows.
- I know, but it must be... cultivated and planted and nurtured, um...
Well, unless you...
You have an economy so well-developed that you can spend all your time... studying and experimenting?
Is that right?
You ask many questions.
Well, that is the only way man has learned and developed.
I wish to learn.
I want to learn about your civilization.
Perhaps, you...
Do you have books?
Books?
- Yes, we have books.
- Wonderful!
I can learn about you from books.
They'll tell me what I want to know.
Could I see the books?
Yes, they do tell me all about you.
What have you done?
Thousands of years of building, rebuilding, creating and re-creating... so you can let it crumble to dust!
A million years of sensitive men dying for their dreams.
For what?
So you can swim and dance... and play!
You! All of you!
I'm going back! I won't bother to tell of the useless struggle... the hopeless future. But at least I'll die among men!
You're... Aah!
- Weena, what are you doing?
- I came to warn you.
- How do you open that panel?
- No one can. Only the Morlocks.
Who are the Morlocks?
They give us our food and clothes. We must obey.
Why'd they take my machine?
You've got to tell me!
We mustn't be out in the dark.
Only children are frightened by the dark.
You are a child, aren't you?
- I'll light a fire.
- Please, let us go.
My machine is inside. I must find a way to get it out.
- No, you mustn't.
- Help me gather some wood.
Come on.
That's a girl.
Where are you from?
As a matter of fact,
I'm from right here.
That's where my house used to be... many thousands of years ago.
You see there?
Up to those panels was my laboratory.
Beyond them was where my garden used to be.
And right there... that was my library.
Where I once sat talking with friends about... the time machine.
Mm.
You know, Weena...
I'd hoped to learn such a great deal.
I hoped to take back the knowledge and advancement man had made.
Instead, I find vegetables.
The human race reduced to living vegetables.
They're gone. Are you all right?
- Was that a Morlock?
- Yes.
Don't you worry. The fire seems to keep them away.
What are you doing? Why did you put your hand there?
- I never saw it before.
- You...?
No knowledge of fire.
No books.
I'm terribly sorry.
I had no right to be angry with your people.
No more than if I'd visited the island of Bali in my own time.
But, you know, Weena... you were safe inside your house, yet came out to warn me.
The characteristic which distinguished man from animals... was the spirit of self-sacrifice.
And you have that quality.
So do all your people. It just needs someone to reawaken it.
I'd like to try, if you'll let me.
Will you?
I do not understand...
- ...but I believe you.
- Heh.
That's as good a start as any.
Try to tell me. The Morlocks...
Who or what are they?
Are they animals or people?
Well, what about yourself?
Don't your people ever speak of the past?
There is no past.
Well, do they ever wonder about the future?
There is no future.
The past... man's past... is mainly a grim struggle for survival.
But there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up... and these rare moments have made man's past... a glorious thing.
I refuse to believe it's dead and gone.
We've had dark ages before.
This is just another one.
All it needs is someone to show you the way out.
I'm only a mechanic... but I'm sure there must be that spark in one of you.
If only I can kindle that spark... my coming here will have meaning.
My efforts to open the panel were fruitless.
I had to find another way to retrieve my machine.
Listen.
Do you hear that?
Yes.
Machines?
- No, Morlocks.
- Wait.
Those animals run machines?
They are Morlocks.
- Have you ever seen the machines?
- No, only heard of them.
- Who told you?
- The rings.
- What sort of rings?
- Rings that talk.
Could you show me these rings?
Come, this way.
- These are the talking rings?
- Yes.
They speak?
Of what?
Things no one here understands.
Make it talk.
Now in its 326th year, the war between the East and West...
has at last come to an end.
There's nothing to fight with and few left to fight.
The atmosphere has become so polluted with germs...
that it can no longer be breathed.
There is no place left that is immune.
The last factory for the manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed.
Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing...
and when they are gone, we must die.
My name is of no consequence.
You should know that I am the last who remembers how each of us...
man and woman, made his own decision.
Some chose to take refuge in the great caverns...
and find a new way of life below the Earth's surface.
The rest of us decided to take our chances in the sunlight...
small as those chances might be.
From the rings I learned how the human race divided...
and how the world of the
Eloi and the Morlocks began.
By some awful quirk of fate...
the Morlocks became the masters and the Eloi their servants.
The Morlocks maintained them and bred them like...
Like cattle...
only to take them below when they reached maturity.
Which explained why there were no older people.
I knew I must go below. It was the only way to reach my machine...
and discover what happened to the little people.
Don't go!
- You won't come back!
- I'll be back.
Weena?
Weena!
Weena?
Weena?
Weena?
Answer me!
Where are you?
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's the matter with you all?
Weena!
Weena?
Weena?
Weena, stop!
Weena?
Stop!
What happens to them?
Don't stand there like fatted cattle!
Will you answer me?
- What is wrong?
- Nothing is wrong. It is all clear.
- What do you mean, all clear?
- All clear.
In the mid-1900s, the bombs, the people calling out, "All clear!"
No!
That's gone! That's passed!
There are no more flying machines!
No bombs! No more wars!
The rings have told us that story.
But you didn't listen!
You didn't learn!
It was ages ago that men were taught to hide when the sirens blew... to run from death, but it's over!
Those men and those who slaughtered them are dead!
But there is nothing to fear. It is all clear.
What about the ones who went below?
How will they come back?
They never come back.
- Nobody can bring them back.
- You can try. You can try!
Won't even one of you try?
Well, I'll try!
So this was the destiny of the Eloi.
They were being bred by the Morlocks...
who had degenerated into the lowest form of human life:
Cannibalism!
Wake up! Come to your senses! All of you!
Burn.
Give me something to burn.
It's my last match.
Good, good.
Get up the stairs!
That's the way out!
The torch!
Get the torch!
Get up the steps! Hurry up!
Come on, hurry!
Go on, Weena.
Gather all the deadwood!
All the wood!
That's fine. Come on, throw it down!
All the deadwood!
Throw it down! Do the same to the other wells!
All the wood down the wells!
All right, to the river!
Back to the river!
All right, let's go!
Another night was coming, but this night no Eloi needed to fear.
The underworld of the
Morlocks was gone...
and so was the life of leisure for the Eloi.
But then what of me?
I was imprisoned in a world...
in which I just did not belong.
Are you sorry?
- Hm? Sorry? Sorry for what?
- That you have to stay?
Yes.
I could tell so much to the people of my time.
I'd let them know... about the sorrow and happiness that the future holds.
Maybe they could learn from it.
Or could they?
- You don't want to stay, do you?
- It isn't that.
It's just that I don't fit here, any more than you would in my time.
I would love to see your time.
Mm-mm. You wouldn't be very happy there.
Do you have someone there?
Someone like me?
No one like you.
I have friends who will miss me, of course.
I'm probably late already.
Women?
No.
There is one woman.
She looks after my house for me.
She's 62 years old and all wrinkled.
How do they wear their hair?
- Who?
- The women of your time.
- Up.
- Up?
Up how?
I don't know. Kind of... up, like that.
Show me!
Would I be pretty?
Yes, you would. Very pretty.
Oh, Weena.
I wish we could go back to my time.
Or even before that, when the world was young.
- We could be so very happy.
- Look!
Look!
Look!
My machine!
Come on, Weena!
Weena!
I was going the wrong way!
Back! I had to go back!
It's the most ridiculous story
I've ever heard. Preposterous!
George, you always could tell a good yarn.
You're a truly great inventor, George.
I think you ought to retire, sir.
Truthfully, George, where have you been the past week?
Don't ask such questions.
It is not hard for a man to lose a week now and again.
I can understand your doubt.
Take it as a lie if you wish.
I scarcely believe it myself, now that I'm back...
David, there's the flower Weena gave me.
A present for you. You're interested in botany.
Try to match that with any known species!
I don't think I can.
- Well, time to go, Bridewell.
- Mm? Oh.
- Yes, it is getting late.
- Good night, George.
Good night, George.
Good night.
You look exhausted, George. You really should get some rest.
Good night. It's grand having you back.
Goodbye, David.
Thanks for being such a good friend. Always.
What do you think, Filby?
One thing is certain.
That flower couldn't bloom in the wintertime.
You don't really believe that story?
Good night.
Go on, driver.
George?
- Mr. Filby, what...?
- He's gone!
Why, look!
I think I understand.
You see the imprint?
This is where it originally stood.
The Morlocks moved it.
They dragged it across the lawn... right into the sphinx. Right there.
Weena was standing here when he last saw her.
Right here! The same space in a different time.
So he dragged his heavy machine back in here... scratching the floor... so he could appear outside the sphinx again... and help the Eloi build a new world.
Build a new world for himself.
- Right where he left her.
- Yes.
It's not like George to return empty-handed.
To try to rebuild a civilization without a plan.
He must have taken something with him.
Nothing.
- Except three books.
- Which three books?
I don't know. Is it important?
Oh, I suppose not.
Only... which three would you have taken?
Do you think he'll ever return?
One cannot choose but wonder.
You see, he has all the time in the world.
Pull that lever!
She's coming in wild!
Air-call number JYG 176542.
Mr. Buckman took off from Houston at 10:22, destination the Bahamas.
That should put him about halfway there.
Of course it's emergency priority. Would
I call you if it was anything else?
Happy New Year, Irene.
Yeah. Calhoun number 5,
Baytown.
Any field closer than Houston can take the Jet Star?
No. Bring 'em back here.
Well, put away your little whistle, Georgie, and load up.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hello?
Yes, Irene.
Oh. Well, hold on a minute.
Bill, what's the flying time back to Houston?
Ed Calhoun's number 5.
Eighty-eight minutes,
Chance.
Well, turn around easy.
We wouldn't wanna scatter
Mr. Lomax's winnings.
Irene, you can have the copter pick me up in an hour and a half.
Right.
And a Happy New Year to you too.
Sorry, folks.
We'll try again next year.
Oh, don't apologize. This is better than gambling in the Bahamas.
Yeah, Irene.
Okay. I'm on the way.
And, uh, Happy New Year to ya.
Bueno. Acapulco Plaza.
No, I'm sorry. Mr. Gregory Parker is not in his room, and he does not answer the page.
Do you have a Dolores Juarez registered?
How 'bout Lupe Estaban?
Yolanda Rodriquez?
Si. Un momento.
Bueno. ¿Quien?
Who knows you are here with me in Acapulco?
Nobody but you, baby...
I thought.
Yeah, Irene.
I'll grab the 6:10 plane out of Mexico City.
Check arrival time in Houston, have the chopper meet me.
Huh?
Same to you.
- It is a fire?
- Yep. You wanna go?
It all started between us at that fire near Durango.
- No.
- Aw...
I could not live through another one.
This one's all set.
Well, move it on in.
Pick some of that iron up.
Can you save the wellhead, Chance, or am I gonna have to redrill it?
Don't cut your throat yet,
Calhoun.
We'll do what we can.
- Uh, Mr. Buckman.
- Yeah?
Acquaint our television audience with what's going on. Have you got anything to say?
Yeah, your TV truck's too close.
Happy New Year!
New year, new job, everything.
Helen, this is
Chance Buckman.
- Helen Meadows.
- How do you do?
She was on the plane from Mexico City.
She's never seen an oil-well fire.
Well, I hope you find this one very interesting, Miss Meadows.
Thank you.
I thought your menu for New Year's was Mexican.
That was last night.
Why waste a perfectly good fire?
Are you gonna watch it with her, or join us?
Huh? Oh, yeah.
- Uh, where are my work clothes?
- Calhoun's trailer.
- You're going to go into that?
- Uh-huh.
You're insane, and so am I for not going on to Denver.
Whoa, honey.
Denver's full of ice and snow... and very cold people.
It's funny.
But for the first time,
I got this sort of a feeling.
It's having met you,
I guess.
I just had to do that.
Greg, what do you think?
What does Chance say?
- Well, not to cut my throat yet.
- Settle for that.
Mr. Parker, what have you got to say on this situation?
Move your truck back.
- Can't you tell our audience what's being done?
- Tell 'em, Cal.
- Mr. Calhoun...
- Larkin here will tell ya. He's my field superintendent.
I notice those fancy red jumpsuits out there.
Why do Buckman and his crew wear them?
I gather that's smart showmanship, eh?
Well, you gather wrong.
Every eye is on those red suits watching for signals.
- Nobody else gives orders.
- Oh, I see.
Hey, what the hell's goin' on?
The equipment's overheating!
They've got to clear away every piece of metal, otherwise when they blow the fire out, the hot metal will reignite it.
According to Mr. Larkin, that section of drill pipe you see sticking out... has to be cut off right at the wellhead... before they can move in with the nitro.
It's spreading the flame. They've got to have a single column shooting straight up... before they'll try to blow it.
Just how soon before they'll attempt to blow this fire out?
They won't try to kill it 'til they're ready to cap the well.
The control head's being assembled to Buckman's order and isn't here yet.
Joe, we better get to work on that nitro.
Don't tell me, I know.
You're bushed.
You'd like to take a little nap.
Well, I was up all night.
Of course you couldn't have slept on the plane.
What'd you use for openers this trip?
The old headache gag?
Why, you poor man.
Perhaps if I rubbed your neck.
True, every word, true.
But it works.
Well, I can't say
I blame ya.
A fella as ugly as you are couldn't get to first base without a fire.
Here's the control head.
Get it rigged.
I'll finish with the nitro.
Okay. George!
Sorry to interrupt your nap.
Yeah, George said it broke your heart.
One of these days some husband or boyfriend's... gonna show up with a 12 gauge... and turn your prat into a punchboard.
The drum filled with nitro is covered with asbestos... and kept wet to keep it from exploding too soon.
For the benefit of our television audience, what'll happen if it does?
There won't be enough left of them to pick up and put together.
Then we better get back in this remote truck. Come on!
The explosion eliminates the oxygen which is what kills the fire, but the nitro drum has to be placed in exactly the right position.
They're using brass tools to avoid creating a spark.
Even the static electricity of a man running his hand through his hair... could set if off again.
Ah, what a great sound!
That's it!
Now we can get a statement from Chance Buckman himself!
Hey!
Back off!
- Ambulance!
- Ambulance!
Come on!
Stay back!
Mr. Parker, do you think it's serious?
No, we're still sweating him out, Cal.
Sure. Sure, Cal.
The minute I know anything.
Thanks.
Joe, how is he?
He's still in surgery,
Jack.
He took a real bad beating.
Aw, he's had busted ribs before.
This time his lung's punctured.
It's bad enough that Greg got the number from Irene and called San Francisco.
Madelyn and Tish?
How in the hell did he hear about them?
- Did you open your...
- One night last year down in Mexi...
Chance got stoned to the eyes, and Greg spotted a photograph in his wallet.
Greg asked Chance who it is,
Chance tells him it's his wife and daughter, and if Greg ever mentions it again, he's gonna break him in two, that's how.
They're not coming here?
Well, Madelyn's in Europe, and the girl's skiing in Jackson, Wyoming.
Greg flew up to get her.
- You couldn't stop him, eh?
- No. I agreed with him.
Suppose Chance...
Suppose...
Suppose it doesn't look like he's gonna make it?
At least he might have time enough to see his child.
- Miss Buckman?
- Yes.
I'm Greg Parker.
I phoned you.
Thank you.
I'm a little uncertain about this.
Funny time to be uncertain, isn't it?
I mean, I'm not sure
I should come at all.
That's funnier yet.
Just a minute.
You said he didn't ask for me.
This was your idea.
What difference does that make?
He's your father, and he might die.
Would you get aboard, please?
You, uh... you okay?
I don't know.
Frankly, I don't know how I'm supposed to feel.
I'm sorry he's hurt.
I want him to get better.
But l...
I hardly remember my father.
Your mother never took the time to fill you in on him?
All she ever told me was that he was in the oil business, and that he was a wonderful man... and that she was the wrong woman for him.
When I was old enough to realize how unhappy it made her,
I stopped asking questions.
Well, she couldn't exactly rap him for all the dough he must've been sending her.
She never took a penny from him, that I know.
Her name was Randolph, of Randolph
Department Stores in San Francisco.
Oh, yeah, Randolph.
Well, that, uh...
That made it easy for her to walk out on him, didn't it?
You're struggling to be some sort of boor.
- No, I just know it wasn't Chance's fault.
- Were you there?
No, no, but I got a clear picture now.
He had the bad luck to marry a complete bitch.
Shorty, it's getting hard to breathe in here.
- Why don't you go forward?
- l...
I, uh...
I will.
Look, I'm sorry.
It's just that your dad, he means...
I-I'm sorry.
Hiya, Joe.
How is he?
It wasn't near as bad as we were told.
He's gonna be all right.
- Knock wood.
- Tish!
- Uncle Jack!
- So good to see you.
They just brought him down.
The doctor'll be out in a minute.
- It seems you know each other.
- I've known him all my life.
- This is Joe Horn, dear. George Harris.
- Hi.
The last time I saw you, you were in rompers.
Hello again.
I didn't know you knew my father.
Your father wanted it that way.
And your mother went along with it.
I've just been keeping track of both of you... for him.
I'm completely...
Not nearly as surprised, if that's what you mean, as I am.
Here's the doctor.
Well, as usual, he's not what you'd call the most cooperative patient.
Halfway out of the anesthetic he says, "Where's my pants?
I want to get out of this hospital."
Figures.
- May we see him?
- No, I had to put him out but good.
It looks like we're gonna have to keep him unconscious to hold him a spell.
- Could I see him?
- It'll be at least the end of the week.
Bill, this is his daughter.
Oh? Oh, well, then come along,
Miss Buckman, come along.
Uh... what-what's all the mystery about?
There's no mystery.
There just seems to be.
Boy, there's nothing like a nice clean-cut, straightforward answer.
Thank you, Jack.
This is my place, and this is your father's.
We both have guest rooms.
I think you'd prefer your father's.
Mr. Lomax!
How is he, Mr. Lomax?
- Ah, he's gonna be fine, Hernando.
- Gracias a Dios.
This is Mr. Buckman's daughter.
She'll be staying with us.
Put her bags in the guest room, will you?
Anything I can get you, senorita?
- Uh, no, thank you.
- You can turn in now, Hernando.
- Bueno. Buenas noches.
- Good night.
Well, as long as I've got a lot of talking to do,
- I think I can do it better with a drink.
- All right.
Comin' right up.
Tish?
Uh, Scotch rocks, now that you don't look like you want to slip me a mickey.
Seems we started off with sort of a ruckus.
Divided loyalties over my mother and father.
Here you are.
You're on, Uncle Jack.
Honey, a long time ago,
I fought oil fires for a living too.
Your dad and I were, well, just like he and Greg are now.
We were coming back from a job in Indonesia, and we stopped off in San Francisco.
Chance had promised some gal a fur coat, and he went to Randolph's to buy it.
I never did know what happened to that fur coat.
But two weeks later he showed up here in Houston... married to your mother.
I knew from the start our work terrified her.
But she wouldn't let on to Chance, and she wouldn't let me tell him.
Then you came along.
And two weeks later,
I broke my back in a fire.
The next few months, every job Chance went on was a nightmare for her.
She couldn't hide it anymore and he couldn't quit, so she packed up and took you back to San Francisco.
Then how is it
I remember him?
I must've been five or six.
That's right, honey.
Then went back together a half dozen times, but your mother could never get over her fear.
And your father knew if she was to be happy, he'd have to stay out of her life.
So, that's the decision he made for them.
I understand a lot of things about my mother now.
I don't think she's ever been out of love with him.
Oh, well, I know he's never been out of love with her.
But still, he couldn't give up his work.
Honey, since my accident,
I've been extremely lucky in everything I've touched.
But I'm just another Texas oil man with his own building.
Your father is one of a kind.
The best there is in what he does.
No man can walk away from that.
Thank you for bringing me here.
You're welcome.
How do you think he'll feel about seeing me?
Am I going to remind him of something he'd rather leave forgotten?
Forgotten? Honey, he's followed you two like a hungry man.
Through me, the San Francisco papers, any way he could.
I remember once when you had the chicken pox,
I had to stop him from flying in half the Mayo Clinic.
I'll be damned.
I've known this man for ten years, and he's kept all this under wraps.
The investments you made for me.
The money came from my father, didn't it?
Yes, but you're not to tell him I told you.
Tish, it's been a day for you.
Why don't we all turn in? Greg?
I'll check with the hospital and keep you both posted.
Your room is the first door on the left at the top of the stairs.
Just buzz Hernando if you need anything.
And if you'll knock on my door in the morning,
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
- Thanks for everything.
- Good night, dear.
- You too, Greg.
- Good night, Tish.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I'm Letitia Buckman.
Oh, well, I'm Irene Foster.
The boys told me you were in town.
They're back here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hello, there.
- What a surprise.
A business office.
Fine thing.
Won't they let you play with them?
No, I'm into them for too much.
This is my game.
- It's an exhausting business.
- Mmm.
I'll bring some coffee.
I just missed you at the hospital.
You were pulling out as I was pulling in.
- How good is Dr. Forrest?
- The best.
I wonder. He tells me
Dad is fine, then he tells me it's no use coming back for another week.
He told you he was gonna keep him sedated.
It's the only way the doc can keep from tangling with your old man.
That reminds me.
I have a message from Uncle Jack.
He's gonna take the blame for my being here.
- Lomax doesn't have to...
- Buy it, will ya?
These are incredible!
Is this what they're really like?
Kind of, yeah, but no two are ever the same.
Come here.
I want to show you something.
This is where your dad signs the checks, when he gets around to it.
From an African tribal chief.
His presentation speech lasted over an hour.
What he was saying was that to him,
Chance hung the moon.
My work room.
Except Chance uses it for all the junk he collects.
This one's oddball.
Mexico.
That's live steam shooting up under 6,000 pounds pressure.
- No oil?
- They drilled into an underground volcano.
Chance capped that one by himself.
- Where were you?
- In Nigeria on another job.
Chance talked them into building a power plant.
Says it'll supply eight Mexican towns for the next hundred years.
That's wonderful.
Coffee's ready!
Oh, here you are.
Thank you.
Buckman Company.
From another African chief?
No, a witch doctor.
I told Chance he ought to wear it.
It improves his looks.
Just a moment.
It's Chuck Barton.
Yeah, Chuck.
Greg Parker.
Yeah.
Chance can't make it.
Joe and I'll handle it.
Be there in two hours.
Barton number 7,
Landry Parrish, Louisiana.
Irene, pull the file on...
Tri-State Acadia
Parrish fire.
- We'll take the chopper, George.
- Right.
What's he looking at?
We keep a record of equipment we've had manufactured all over the world.
- That's the list nearest this job.
- Is it a big fire?
Big or small, it's money.
I'll go with you.
Uh, I don't think your father would want that. What do you say, Joe?
No, Chance... He's kinda funny that way, huh, Irene?
Oh, well, he does get definite ideas about things. No!
Sorry, Tish.
Call Tri-State and tell them to roll the entire list over to Barton 7.
Wait a minute.
- How far is New Orleans from this fire?
- About 90 miles.
I was thinking of going to New Orleans, anyway.
I thought I could visit a friend until I can see my father.
All right, you can use the jet.
Irene'll arrange it.
Ten thousand scattered and fifteen miles. Thanks.
- No sweat. We're all clear.
- Bye-bye.
Joe, George.
Greg.
See ya when we get back.
Would you, uh, like to let your friend know you're coming?
Yes, I would.
Operator?
New Orleans information.
Miss Joan Gilman,
112 Elm Street.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Come on!
- What's the big rush?
I got to get me a rent car.
- You going to a fire or something?
- Yes.
- What for?
- I met a fireman.
- Hi, George.
- How'd you get here?
In this.
Would you tell this officer that I am Chance Buckman's daughter?
She sure is.
I'm sorry, Miss.
If I was to let everybody through, there'd be a thousand sightseers.
I saw them. It took me hours to get through the traffic.
- Where are Greg and Joe?
- At the motel before the turn-off.
You passed it comin' in.
What're they doing there?
Is anything wrong?
No. Greg's a little unhappy about the water supply, but it's being worked on.
Thank you.
- Hi, Joe.
- How'd you get here?
In that.
Tish, what the hell are you doin' here?
At least you didn't ask me how I got here.
I thought I'd drop by and see what was going on, as long as I was this close.
New Orleans is a hundred miles from here!
It's practically in the neighborhood.
You know, you ought to put on a little weight.
Don't bother.
I'm family.
I take it you've been to the fire.
- Yes.
- Then you've seen about everything there is.
What about your putting it out?
The drilling contractor has to rerig his pumps. He won't be ready 'til tomorrow.
I don't mind waiting.
There are lots of rooms.
The manager's complaining about you stopping traffic.
- You're murdering his business.
- What happened to your friend?
I picked a terrible time to visit her.
She's got the mumps.
Don't let it scare you.
I didn't go near her.
I'd appreciate it if you went back to New Orleans... and grabbed the first plane to Houston.
I'd appreciate knowing why everyone is so concerned... about my being at a fire.
Upsetting my father?
Why should it?
- Well...
- Well, what?
Well, uh, uh...
Nothing. It's just... you shouldn't be here.
Well, I am, so let's take it from there.
There's nothing to do here.
We're just sittin' around playin' gin.
Lovely. You two look like pigeons.
What're you playin' for?
It's out! It's out!
Oh, no!
Oh, my God!
Uh-oh.
What's the matter?
We wake you up?
You knew I wanted to be here when you put the fire out.
We didn't put the fire out. We missed.
We gotta go for another shot.
Good. Then
I made it after all.
Tish, they know you're
Chance's daughter.
Now, what's the matter with you, bargin' in here with no clothes on?
- You worried about my reputation?
- Yes.
Yes, I am, damn it!
Greg, that's very sweet, but you might as well begin to learn when you've lost an argument.
And you've lost this one.
I'm staying right here.
- You didn't!
- Yes, I did!
- Without asking me?
- You were in no shape.
Which makes it all the more stupid your bringing her here.
I'm gonna get out.
Where are my clothes?
Go ahead, act like an idiot.
She's right outside.
The last time I saw you, you... your two front teeth were missing.
I think you bought me a little live monkey that squeaked.
And it bit too.
So I bought you a toy one, and you were just as happy because it squeaked also.
I wasn't really, but Mother wouldn't let me tell you.
All that hollerin' you were doing, you're still angry about my being here?
Worth gettin' all busted up for.
Speaking of your mother, what does she say about your coming here?
She's in Europe.
She doesn't know.
Let's keep it that way.
We can't.
Too much has happened.
What?
- For starters, I went to a fire and...
- You went to an oil fire?
Yes, I went to an oil fire with Greg.
Pardon me. Greg!
- What the hell?
- You took my daughter to an oil fire.
- What's wrong with that?
- I'll tell you what's wrong with it.
Every time he takes a girl...
Every time...
- Whenever he...
- Sputter away, Dad.
We got married yesterday.
Well, say somethin', you big ape.
Aren't you gonna congratulate them?
It was the cutest
Cajun church in Louisiana.
Maybe if it hadn't been there, we would have waited.
I'd like to talk to Tish alone.
Doesn't this concern the three of us?
Greg, please.
- Tish, I, uh...
- I know what you're going to say.
Can I really love a man if
I've known him five days?
Well, I do love him, and there's not the slightest doubt that he loves me.
If you're going to bring up about you and Mother, it won't happen to me.
Uncle Jack told me about it.
I've been to a fire.
I didn't fall apart.
You know, I'm not all Mother's daughter.
I'm your daughter too.
Doesn't that make the difference?
Yeah. Yeah!
What're you standing out there for?
Come on in.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.
And I wish you everything wonderful, Tish.
Everything in the world.
I got a lot of champagne.
Great!
Let's go celebrate.
I'll drink to that.
Wait'll I get my coat.
But, Mr. Buckman,
I don't know about this.
I do, Mrs. Thistlewait.
I'm a new father-in-law.
- I did leave messages.
- Well, find him.
Okay, I'll try again.
Oh, we've been trying to reach you all afternoon.
I figured it was a riot call.
Bourbon for me.
You picked a hell of a day to be out of the office.
I know. Madelyn is flying in from Paris.
Tish is meeting her plane about now.
Simmer down.
Pour me my drink.
If you knew, why didn't you head her off?
They don't call passengers to the phone.
- How's your arm?
- Fine, fine.
You know who she's gonna blame for this marriage... me!
I'll testify you didn't hold a gun on 'em.
Cut out the jokes, and help me figure out how to handle this.
I am. You're all having dinner together.
I made a reservation at the club.
Greg is coming to pick you up.
- You've got a suit here, haven't you?
- You're going, aren't you?
Definitely not.
This is something for the four of you to hash out.
Madelyn is staying at my place.
I'll get the rundown later.
You're not scared, are you?
You're damn right I am.
Who's got the most butterflies, you or me?
Mine are dive bombers.
I never met a mother-in-law before, at least not one of my own.
If you're comin' to me for advice, I'm a dry hole.
Mother.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Mother, this is Greg.
- How do you do, Mrs. Buckman?
Please call me Madelyn.
How are you, Chance?
Fine. You're looking well.
Sit down.
Is it still gin and tonic?
Yes, and tonight
I think several.
- Scotch on the rocks for me.
- Yes, ma'am.
Well, Tish told me how this all came about.
As usual, you came out of it smiling and happy.
I think we all did.
I understand your first comment about me... was that I had to be a complete bitch.
- I was kind of mad and excited.
- Relax, both of you.
- Mother thought it was funny.
- You did?
I like a man who's honest and outspoken.
Well, obviously
I was dead wrong.
Well, I want to wish you two all the... happiness in the world.
- I'll drink to that.
- Thank you.
How are you on the dance floor?
Ummm. I knew you'd get around to that.
No matter what,
I won't throw you back.
They're gonna have a lot of fun, those two.
I hope so. Am I taking this better than you thought?
Oh, I knew you'd take it all right.
You never saw anybody as enthused as that Tish. She's out house hunting...
- We might as well face it, Chance.
- Face what?
Every time he leaves her, she's going to go through hell.
- She says she's going with him.
- That makes it worse.
I watched them put Jack into a wheelchair for the rest of his life.
I ran because I couldn't bear the thought of them doing it to you.
- I don't want Tish...
- Tish isn't you, Madelyn!
She thinks she can make it, and I think so too.
Besides, there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
Give 'em a break, will ya?
- I haven't any alternative, have I?
- No.
You're still wearing it?
I heard you were... engaged a couple of times.
Well, never seriously enough to go through with it.
Well, I'd say they were two very unlucky fellas.
Madelyn, when you came down those stairs, this...
Why don't you order me a drink and tell me all the Houston gossip.
They don't let me in on the gossip, and you don't need another drink.
Isn't it beautiful?
It's lovely.
- That settles it, Greg. Let's buy it.
- Seems we've decided.
I wish we could move into it right now.
I don't think the people living there now would appreciate that.
Yeah, Irene.
I can't hear you.
No, I still can't hear you.
- What's the matter?
- Phone's out of whack.
Call her from my place.
We'll talk to you from Chance's.
Let's go.
Yeah, Irene.
Oh, I guess we can get started about 7:00.
Oh, tell George he can come along.
Right.
- Where is it?
- Canada, outside of Calgary.
- Lightning cracked a control head.
- Why George?
We're not taking the chopper.
Well, he's been wanting to break in for a long time. I think he's ready.
- You're not going along.
- What do you mean?
Well, a fella just married usually goes on a honeymoon.
You got a bum arm.
Ah, that's the doctor's idea.
I think Canada is a perfect place for a honeymoon.
You serving breakfast?
Yeah.
Oh, Mother, here's the key to Uncle Jack's apartment.
See you in the morning.
At least you tried to give them a decent honeymoon. Thank you for that.
You gonna use that key?
I won't if you ask me not to, and you know it.
Please don't.
How about a nightcap?
One.
- You all right?
- What's with you? I saw that iron falling.
- Then why didn't you move?
- I was movin' when you booted me.
George, Joe'll take in the nitro.
- Right.
- That's my job.
- Take a breather.
- Who brings in the new control heads?
George.
Chance, I'm okay.
I can do my job.
All right, do it.
Headstrong.
What'd you do, cross your skis?
Tish, I want you to get back. Way back.
I'll tap you.
Call.
Whew. You sure inherited your old man's luck at cards.
I'm just a better player than you.
Let me show her how an expert handles those pasteboards.
Try not to get wiped out, expert.
Our Houston E.T.A. is 6:30.
Uh-huh.
You got something on your mind.
- Let's have it. - Stop looking out for me because I'm your son-in-law.
What left field did that come out of?
Kicking me in the guts like a loco mule, and that bilge about my taking a breather?
I'd have done that for George or Joe or anybody.
- You sure of that?
- I'm damn sure.
And while we're on that son-in-law bit, what's the idea of bringing
Tish to these fires?
It's lousy food and about as much privacy as an outhouse.
That's no place to bring your wife.
She'll go wherever she wants to go because she is my wife.
She's my daughter too, bub!
She's got your luck at cards, and she inherited some of your guts. Are you satisfied?
If that's the way you two want it, fine, but just get off my back, that's all.
I was in San Francisco yesterday.
Had lunch with Madelyn.
- How is she?
- Oh, fine.
The usual questions, all boiling down to one:
How is Tish bearing up after ten fires?
Why ask you? Greg and Tish are up there with her, aren't they?
She thinks Tish is putting on an act, and she really don't believe me.
How is Tish at the fires, Chance?
Well, she seems to be bearing up all right.
And you?
Does there look like there's something wrong with me?
Madelyn was hoping you might finally see things from her point of view.
You gonna shoot or stand there all day?
Yes, Irene.
Buckman here.
Yes. Oh?
I think we could get there by day after tomorrow.
We'll cable you the flight number.
Fine. Thank you.
Long haul, huh?
Malaya, above Penang.
Poison well fire.
Hydrogen sulfate.
Is Irene calling Greg?
Well, I... didn't tell her not to.
Uh-huh.
Marker!
There's a call for you in the snack bar.
Okay. See you on the green.
I just scuffed a ball,
Mother, that's all.
Don't read anything into it that isn't there.
You've been smoking more, and I notice you've been drinking a little faster lately.
Don't read anything into that that isn't there either.
I'd rather have one week or one day or one hour of happiness with Greg... than the years of loneliness you've had.
- Chance! Greg!
- Amal!
- Good to see you, Amal.
- Not half as good as it is to see you two.
- We're in trouble.
- Tish.
This is Amal Bokru.
My wife.
- My daughter.
- My father-in-law.
- And my pleasure.
- How do you do?
- Welcome to Malaya, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you.
Congratulations, Greg.
You must be tired. Your rooms are ready, but they'll need your passports at the desk.
I have them.
I'll take care of it.
How do we stand on equipment?
Everything you cabled for is being trucked into the jungle.
- Most of it should be there by now.
- What about the gas masks?
The army was a little upset you would not use theirs.
For a sour well we want equipment we're used to.
Poison well?
I never heard of such a thing.
Eight men were in the field house when it caught fire 100 yards away.
- Seven are dead, and the eighth is blind.
- Yeah.
- Have you got a chopper for us?
- The military's flying one in.
- It can't be here until late tomorrow.
- We'll drive out in the morning.
Amal!
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi, Amal. This is George Harris.
- How you been?
- Fine, thank you.
I was in Sumatra... and someone remembered
I'd worked with you before.
That's how I volunteered to assist you in this fire.
It came at a most inconvenient time.
Sounds like you got something going on in Sumatra... besides the oil business.
I'm afraid I'm getting in the way of an interesting conversation.
Since you men are going gambling at Madame Loo's and I'm not invited,
I'll look for a shop and spend some of your money.
How did you know about Madame Loo's?
People have to talk about something when they're married.
Besides, I bought the cigarettes you smuggled in for her.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
We're getting up at daybreak.
Don't be too late.
Tish, you're not going to this fire.
- The jungle is no place for you.
- The conditions are extremely primitive.
You'd better sit this one out.
A rejected woman needs mad money.
- Good night. - Good night. - Good night.
Exactly what did you tell her about Madame Loo?
Only that she's 80 years old, weighs 300 pounds... and is one of your oldest friends.
Yeah.
Chance!
- Chance!
- Loozie-Loo!
- Ha ha!
- Bend down here.
- What's new?
- Nothing.
When Amal phoned you were coming... Wham!
My heart goes as always.
- Greg.
- Hi, Loo.
- Joe! Ohh!
- Hi!
- And this is George.
- Me too?
Oh, sure!
You did not forget.
American cigarettes!
Oh, but I worry.
He might think these are the only reasons I love him.
Come. I saved you the big table.
Married, baby.
Greg! My Greg!
Gum Drop!
Oh.
Amal did not tell us that.
You love her?
That's it, Gum Drop.
What's the matter?
That thing with Gum Drop didn't look like any "Poor Butterfly" act to me.
You dirty old den mother. She's gonna name her first baby after me.
- Ohh!
- And another thing.
If I don't want Tish at an oil fire, I'll tell her.
- Well, tell her.
- I did!
Greg, this is the Australian crew working the well.
Chance Buckman, gentlemen.
Greg Parker.
Hiya, mate.
Jim Hatch, driller.
When are you fellas due back at the well?
Early tomorrow morning.
We're on day tower. Why?
- If you keep on this sauce, you won't be much use to me.
Mr. Buckman, we're gentlemen who pleasure ourselves in drinking as we see fit.
Mr. Buckman, we're gentlemen who pleasure ourselves in drinking as we see fit.
- Right, mates?
- Right. - Right.
What do you think about that?
Very simple.
There's one boss.
He's all mine!
He's all mine!
- Now?
- Now!
Big Australian oaf!
Look what you've done to my place!
We had a little to do with it.
- Add it up, lady. I'll pay ya.
- The boss pays.
You get your crew out there in the morning, sober and on time.
- Right?
- Right.
Come on, you blokes.
Let's go.
- I'll buy you a drink.
- Let the dirty old den mother buy the drinks.
I love you, Mother.
- He's all mine!
- The war's over!
Good morning.
What happened to you?
- Ran into them firefighters last night.
- How'd it end?
- Friendly.
- Good.
What a hairy beast!
Hiya, Mr. Buckman.
- I made it on time.
- "Fair dinkem," digger.
Gentlemen, this is Dr. Songla... and the field superintendent
Harry York.
- Glad to have you here.
- We didn't think we were gonna make it.
- We spent most of our time airborne on these roads.
- They wash out when it rains.
- It rains nearly every day.
- You don't intend to bring the nitro in over them.
- Well, I, uh...
- Don't try it.
Radio Penang and have it brought in by copter.
I see the pumps got here.
How soon before you'll have 'em rigged?
- Should be tomorrow.
- Any pattern to the wind current?
- Shifting all the time.
- They're murder.
That's why everyone's been moved back this far.
The fumes are reaching the field house, so we had to abandon it.
That's where the men were killed.
This side of the yellow flags is safe.
Beyond them, gas masks have to be worn.
That's why we brought oxygen masks and tanks.
That way we can work in half-hour shifts.
You bring the nitro?
Yeah, and I'd very much appreciate if you'd unload it.
What are you doing here?
You'll never guess what happened.
What do you mean, what happened?
I found the greatest delicatessen in Penang.
Bagels, smoked salmon and...
- One of the lost tribes, I guess.
- It's not funny, Tish.
That's some greeting.
I thought I'd bring you fellas lunch.
Lunch? In a chopper full of nitro glycerine?
If it hadn't been for me, the nitro might not have gotten here.
No one wanted to fly it 'til
I found Lieutenant Singh.
- When I tell you I don't want you here, I mean...
- Look out!
Get him out of here!
Easy!
Watch his legs!
Watch it, watch it.
- He's dead.
- When did he take off his gas mask?
A couple of seconds before we did.
We were in the safe zone.
Move back the warning flags.
Gimme a hand.
What is it?
It's a poison gas well,
Tish.
You didn't mention that.
You're going back on this copter.
No, I'm not.
I was going, but I'm not.
We promised to level with each other, not keep anything back.
She's staying,
Chance.
- I'm not interested in any damn fool promises you...
- Dad, I'm staying.
Get the hell outta here!
I'm gonna get something to pry you loose.
Doctor, come on.
Hurry!
Easy, Greg. You're gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.
Greg? I'd like to talk to ya.
I'm going to dissolve this outfit.
Now, look, I know something's been bugging you since Malaya.
You wanna talk about it, let's talk.
I've made up my mind.
There's nothing to talk about.
You haven't made up your mind, you've lost it.
Tish?
Come on in here.
Sit down.
I've decided it's time to quit this business.
I'm going with Lomax Oil, and there's a spot for Greg.
I want him to come with me.
How do you feel about it?
- It depends how Greg feels.
- I'd go right up the wall.
I'll stick with the job
I know best.
What job? I guess you didn't hear me. This outfit's folded.
Then I'll start my own or take over this one. Just tell me how you want it paid off.
Look, the agreement you two made... to level with each other...
I saw the look on your face when we dragged Greg out of that last one.
Tell him how you feel about it, how you honestly feel.
Greg can pay all cash, if you want.
Maybe it's a dirty trick, but I've got the money you sent to me over the years.
- Wait a minute, your money's got nothing to do with this.
- Forget it.
You can have it.
Call it a wedding present.
I don't want any gifts!
I'll pay you twice what it's worth!
Greg.
- Chance.
- Yeah?
How do you want it?
Do we stay with Greg or not?
That's a fool question. But there's one thing I'm worried about.
He's not too smart about which fires to walk away from.
- I read ya.
- Thanks.
Well, looks like we... got a new boss.
Next item on the agenda... is to finalize what color or combinations of colors... should be used to redo the restrooms in our gas stations.
Since we have over 1,400 stations, this is a pretty weighty matter.
Lipman here of the art department... has had the research section make a survey to determine... the public's preference in restroom decor.
He'll fill us in on their findings.
This soft willow green, gentlemen, is preferred by people of all ages, according to our survey.
They find it soothing and restful.
Yet the very chic women... seem to prefer this lovely royal blue.
However, research points out... a strong psychological advantage to this color, which we'll call flaming heart red.
It tends to make people spend less time in the restroom, drives them out for the convenience of the next customer.
Gentlemen, it's up to you.
Which would you prefer?
Flaming heart red, the lovely royal blue... or the soft willow green?
What are we arguing about? She's cratered and the casing's shattered.
The only thing you can do with that fire is kill it with a relief hole, then go drill yourself another well.
That one's down 12,000 feet.
It'll cost us over 300,000.
Plus my bill for wasting my time.
I doubt Chance Buckman would say just write it off.
Well, you just call him and ask him.
It is the unanimous opinion of the committee that we abandon the negotiations.
Why?
Mr. Buckman, since I've chaired the finance committee... we've made it policy never to enter a joint venture... unless we control the drilling operations.
Now, the Jansen brothers have always...
Yeah?
I know you're not to be interrupted, but it's Mr. Mullen of the Mullen
Oil Company calling Mr. Buckman.
He says it's urgent.
Yeah, Mike?
Uh-huh.
Well, had the well cratered before they called Greg in?
Greg must be gettin' soft.
You'd called me out there, I'd have punched your field superintendent in the nose.
Yeah, well, nice talkin' to you too, Mike.
Regards to your wife.
Right.
Greg walk away from one?
Nothing to walk away from.
It was impossible.
Thompson, I don't know too much about policy around here, but the Jansen brothers were smellin' out oil before you were born.
Check the fields they've brought in.
You can call it luck or "seat of your pants" or whatever. They find oil.
And speaking of policy,
Thompson, the policy of an oil company should be to find oil.
- They're most difficult men. We just don't...
- Chance talks their language.
He'll take care of it.
Yes, sir.
Well, I guess that kind of wraps it up.
Where are we gonna have dinner tonight, your place or mine?
- Why don't we go to the club for a change?
- No, I got another meeting.
Fiscal stuff.
You'd hate it.
Go up and have a drink.
I'll call you when I can.
Good idea.
Well, I'll be damned.
That's probably the most romantic greeting a woman ever received.
But it still goes.
I'll be damned.
Obviously Jack didn't tell you I was here.
Oh, I was in hopes he didn't know, but that's the pixie in him.
He likes to spring surprises, and this is one that I'll hold still for.
And just in case you might ask me for dinner,
Hernando's gone to the market... and I'm charged with fixing Senor Buckman his long-hard- day-at-the-office drink.
Do you remember what it is?
Jack tells me you're doing just great down there.
Well, it's not as dull as I thought it'd be.
- As a matter of fact, it's pretty interesting.
- That's wonderful.
I suppose Jack also told you that Tish and Greg... would probably be back in time for dinner.
I'll check with Irene.
Chance, hang up.
They're not coming back. They're on their way to Sun Valley for skiing.
What happened?
Well, it was my idea, actually.
There are times when children shouldn't be underfoot, nor should business.
When I left the store today, I simply told them I was taking some time off.
Didn't even tell them where I was going.
How's your time for the next couple of weeks?
Looks like I'm gonna be booked up solid.
Welcome home.
Nah.
Fill that, Joe.
Look out for the Venezuelan.
Possible straight.
Pair of cowboys.
- Hello?
- Well, cost you five.
- I'll go along.
- ¿Quien habla?
Un momento, por favor.
The call is for
Senora Parker.
Senora Parker.
It is San Francisco.
A Mrs. Buckman is calling.
Hi, Mother.
Hello, Tish?
Where in Venezuela are you?
I've never heard of it. We've been trying to get you on the phone for hours.
We're flying down to Houston tonight...
Oh.
Well, your father.
Yes, well, it took a bit of female doing, but with one thing and another,
I finally convinced him I should leave the store and come live with him.
Of course, legitimately.
We flipped a coin and he won.
We're getting married in Houston.
Greg, Dad and Mother are going to get married.
When? You can't.
Not 'til we get back.
A daughter has a right to be at her parents' wedding.
She wants us to wait for...
Here, talk to your father.
Hello.
Yeah, well, I kinda like the idea too.
How long are you two gonna be down there?
How long will we be here?
I'll let you talk to Greg.
Congratulations.
About time you did something right.
We should wrap it up in a few more days.
We'll start clearing the junk off tomorrow.
I know how long we've been here, but there's guerrilla activity in the hills.
They've been shootin' up our water lines.
No, no, no, the army's here now... and I've got Colonel Valdez' solemn oath there'll be no more trouble.
Yeah. Yeah. Madelyn wants to talk to you again.
Yes, Mother?
We'll let you know as soon as we're going to leave.
I love you, and I'm very happy for you both.
Bye-bye.
My father is finally going to marry my mother. Isn't that great?
That is very nice.
- Oh, let's see. Where were we?
- It's to you, Tish.
Down!
Second me.
- Colonel, Mr. Chapman and Senor Caldes.
- How do you do?
Please come in.
Tanto gusto,
Senora Parker.
This is Senor Parker.
His Excellency Senor Caldes,
Minister of Interior.
- Senor.
- How do you do?
- General Lopez.
- Tanto gusto, senor.
- Senor Chapman of your United States embassy.
- How do you do?
I was just going to make some coffee.
Would you like some?
- Senor, we have seen the fires. It is most distressing.
- Yeah.
But will you be able to bring them under control?
The end wells we can handle one at a time.
The center three are so closely spaced they'll have to be put out simultaneously, or else they'll reignite each other.
- Can it be done?
- We've never tried it before.
Senor Parker, this oil field is of great importance... to the economy of my country, but even that is secondary.
The clandestine guerrilla radio is boasting... of what they accomplished last night... and claim the fires will never be put out.
They'll turn it into a propaganda field day to sell sabotage all over South America.
I won't even begin the operation if they're shooting at us.
Three more companies of men have been ordered here.
We will blanket the area with troops if necessary, senor.
I've been authorized by the State
Department to offer every assistance.
Anything you need will be made available.
The one thing I really need you can't give me.
Why don't you gentlemen have some coffee. I want to talk to my wife.
Tish.
Tish, I don't care if they've brought in the whole army.
I still worry about you. I want you to fly back to Caracas with them.
I'll phone you every night.
I promise.
It'll just take me a minute to pack.
Do you have to go back and talk to them, or can you come and talk to me?
They can wait.
What's all the mystery? Why do you wait 'til you get here to call me?
And why don't you want your father to know you're here?
Because I have to talk to you, Mother, before I see him. Greg's in trouble.
Oh.
He's on a job I don't think he can handle without Dad.
I know what this means to you.
That's why I had to see you alone first.
Why couldn't they both have just been insurance salesmen?
Please understand.
I've got to ask him.
Is this trouble anything the State Department is aware of?
- Yes.
- Then he probably knows already.
When I left, he was talking with two men who had just flown in from the State Department.
Being told about it is one thing.
- I've got to know his answer.
- Well, surely you can't doubt what that'll be.
Tish, surely you don't think
I'd try to stop him.
Forgive me that, please.
I dreaded coming here.
I dread asking him.
Most of all, I dread what this does to you.
Let's handle one dread at a time.
You don't have to ask him;
I will.
It might be as well if we never tell your father of this conversation.
Or Greg. He doesn't even know I'm here.
He thinks I'm in Caracas.
Mother, there's a plane back in an hour.
Why didn't you tell me you were in trouble?
Why do I have to find out about it from the State Department?
The hell you're not!
Nobody ever tackled that kind of a job.
What size, uh, control heads did you order?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
It's Greg.
He has a little problem.
Yes.
Well, the Air Force has put a National
Guard cargo plane at my disposal.
Of course
I'm coming with it.
I'll be there in the morning.
I just hope you haven't loused things up too much. Right.
Well, at least he had the good sense... to get Tish out of there.
- She's in Caracas.
- Oh.
Madelyn, this is one
I've got to go to.
I know you do.
It involves Tish and Greg.
Well, we'd better face this all at once.
This was bound to happen sooner or later and it'll happen again, and each time I'll...
I'll go.
Thank you for being honest with me.
Well, where does that leave us, honey?
I don't know.
I honestly don't know.
You gonna be here when I get back?
The only plan I have at the moment is to go to Tish. She could use some company.
Yeah.
Irene, call Bill Hansen.
Have him break the jet out of mothballs.
He's taking Mrs. Buckman to Caracas.
Phone back when the plane's ready.
Hmm?
Well, if five fires is your idea of fun, you're nuts.
Sure, sure,
I'll send back pictures.
Color pictures.
Right.
They'll let you know when the plane's ready.
I, uh, I guess
I'd better get packed.
Do you want your hard hat sombrero packed, or will you pick one up...
- Pack it!
- Bueno.
Joe!
It's about time you got back to earning an honest living.
If you think I'm gonna say it's a pleasure to be here, forget it.
- Hi, boss.
- George, nice to see ya.
Hi, boss.
Couldn't be lousier timing for you and Madelyn, could it? I'm sorry.
Forget it. It's probably kinder that she finds out now...
Let's skip talking about it.
I spent a lot of your money.
What did you do, buy up all the control heads in Houston?
This far away from supplies, you get all the spares you can.
This is Col. Valdez, Chance. He's in charge of keeping us from getting shot.
I hope you do a good job, Colonel.
If I do not, you'll have my profound apologies.
The longer you guys stand there, the longer it's gonna take to unload this thing.
Right, Joe.
The guerrillas could still pot shot the water lines.
I had that dredged and filled for emergency water.
Give us time to run.
I sincerely doubt there could be such an emergency.
The entire area is patrolled from the ground and the air.
Well, you'll have to bear with our worryin', Colonel.
We stay alive by being scared to death.
- I do not believe this is ever so.
- Don't bet on it.
What's first,
Greg?
To clear off all five, we'll kill the ones at each end, and then worry about how we knock off the middle three at the same time.
I'll need that third boom arm.
The hang-up's gonna be gettin' that nitro... into the middle three at the same instant.
Given any thought to using those end two for practice?
Blowin' 'em up at the same time?
Welcome back, Chance.
- Here you are.
- Gracias, senora.
Just one cheat, and I could win this one.
I won't tell.
I never cheat when I'm keeping score.
Did you know that there are over
60 different games of solitaire?
According to Hoyle, it's called patience, and there are 102 games.
I played them all.
It's just being stuck so far away.
I'm not like this when I'm there with Greg.
It never worked either way with me.
But that was a long time ago.
Do you want me to take another shower so you can call Bill Hansen again?
- I haven't been fooling you at all, have I?
- What did Bill say?
The area's under martial law.
No one is allowed in except military or emergency personnel.
Bill's tried everyone except the president.
So have I.
Well, Jack Lomax is flying in.
He knows the president.
Forty-three, Joe!
Forty-three on the money!
You can start loading the nitro, Chance.
We got both barrels into the fire at the same split second.
- Right, George?
- Right.
- How many runs?
- Fourteen times from 75 yards out.
The throttle governor wasn't working
'til the last run.
You only got it on the button for one run?
You couldn't time it any closer.
Try a half dozen more.
When you get it on the button every time, then we'll load the nitro.
Yeah, you're right.
Let's go.
Zamora!
Tell them they're bringing in the wrong stuff.
I want only the boxes marked with a red circle.
Es todo lo mismo.
He says it's all nitroglycerin.
The boxes that're marked, we've checked for exact mixture.
That's what we'll need if we're gonna blow two wells at the same time.
Explain that to them.
Quiero no mas, las cajas que tienen la marca del curculo rojo.
Es mucho peligro cargar esto.
They have never worked with nitroglycerin before.
- They are not happy.
- I gathered that.
- What's their bonus, double pay?
- Si, senor.
Well, tell 'em from now on, it's double-double.
That goes for you too.
Tell them that, and call your Caracas office and say I said so.
Bueno.
Unless somebody has some questions,
I guess we're all set.
Greg will raise the flag for ready.
When he drops it, you start.
If there's any reason to abort, he'll raise it again.
Otherwise, we follow set procedure.
- Is it understood?
- Check.
Let's go.
Go! Hit it!
Couldn't be better!
Hang onto the head!
Grab hold!
Ohh!
- Get a jeep!
- There's one comin'!
Lie still.
Hold his leg.
That tight enough?
Yeah. That's good.
Let's get him in there.
Take his shoulders.
Easy does it.
All right.
Move out.
Bring the dozers!
Lay some dirt on those loose fires!
And fill up another nitro barrel!
- Did you get your well capped?
- Hell, no!
Let's go finish it.
We'll come back to this one.
Then we'll pay the army a visit.
I vote for paying the army a visit now.
Not in the mood I'm in.
They hang you for murder down here.
Si, si, bueno.
Gentlemen, I told you I would apologize, but that is not enough.
I feel like cutting my throat.
A couple of hours ago,
I'd have given you the knife.
My Spanish is just good enough to gather... you're expecting more trouble with the guerrillas.
Yes, I must be honest with you.
That is why I have ordered two more companies of infantry and three more helicopters.
Huh. In the meantime, we're gonna try and catch some shut eye.
Let us know when you feel it's safe.
Have your men take the nitro out of that shed... and bury it 'til we need it.
No sniper can get that close.
Two did.
Bury it!
Whatever you people wish done will be done.
Uh, gentlemen?
Thank you very much.
Forget it.
Just a precaution, senora.
I understand there was some guerrilla activity in the vicinity.
What are you doin' here?
Greg, what the hell is Tish doin' here?
- It was my idea.
- Somebody wake me up.
Hold it, hold it!
Blame me. I brought 'em.
If I wanted Tish here,
I'd have let her stay.
Why do you think
I sent her back to Caracas?
I didn't know you did. I was told it was the army keeping her out.
I guess I forgot to mention about Greg.
Yeah, everybody did.
Well, we left in such a hurry.
And that's the way you're goin' back.
In such a hurry.
- And no arguments.
- I am going to argue.
- But in private, if you don't mind.
- Outside, lady.
Hey, Joe!
- Where can I get a cup of coffee?
- Uh, what?
- Where's the coffee?
- In the field office.
Jack, Madelyn!
Never mind Madelyn.
Show me where the coffee is.
Okay.
I'm reading a lot into your being here,
'cause I want to.
Am I right?
Or is it only because Tish is here?
Both.
Oh.
It was terrible in Caracas.
Tish said it would be better here.
I came to find out.
I hate to say this, but Greg's right.
You should go back.
All right.
But if I do, we'll never really know... if there's any hope for us together, Chance.
This fire is it for me, it's the answer.
I-I may fall apart and get the screaming meemies, I don't know.
But if I can take this one...
From what Tish tells me, there'll never be a worse one.
- I think it's worth it for us to find out.
It's settled.
They're going right back.
- They're staying, at least Madelyn is.
- What's with you?
- They're staying.
- Yowiee!
I can't fight all of ya.
The detonator wires on all three nitro drums lead back to this pit... where they're spliced in to one plunger.
Now, nothing triggers
'til that plunger is pushed.
- You hope.
- Fervently.
We knocked off the end two together.
This setup is better.
The wire runs are closer to being the same length.
You tried two, and you happened to come off lucky.
Now you're tackling three.
All it takes is one oversensitive blasting cap booster, a loose piece of asbestos wrapping... or a hot spot burning through an insulated wire, and any one of those drums can go off prematurely, or not at all.
Then where will you be?
Depends on where you are at the time.
Jack, believe me, it's our firm intention to double wrap the asbestos, to triple check the booster caps, and if the insulated wire does burn through, we'll sue the manufacturer.
You two are pretty sure of yourselves.
Not if somebody has a better idea. Do you?
No, I don't.
You wanna know the real reason I came down?
To tell you this is one you ought to back away from.
You wanna know the real reason
I'm glad you're here?
So I could ask you if you wanted to handle this plunger.
I'd like that very much.
Esta libre todo.
No hay peligro.
All clear, Sr. Buckman.
I read you.
Looks like that practice paid off.
- Es un peligro, mi General.
- Bueno, vayan. Andele.
Please, senoras.
Por favor.
You're connected.
Hit it!
Man, ain't it beautiful!
Friend, we made it!
What're we standing around here for?
Right.
Bueno. Si. Tambien.
What is it?
Radar picked up guerrilla planes.
Man!
Don't say that to me again.
There are no excuses!
- It was idiotic and irresponsible!
- Senora is overwrought.
I am not overwrought!
I'm just plain damned mad!
How dare you risk the lives of men who come to help you?
- They were in no danger.
- No danger?
One bullet in those...
He knew the guerrillas had airplanes!
We didn't know.
We suspected aircraft was made available to them from outside the country, so we took every precaution.
Five aircraft crossed our border, but only two reached the area.
Those are the two I'm talking about, you... Say something!
You're doing just fine.
- Sr. Buckman...
- No apologies necessary, Colonel.
Everything turned out just great.
Damned if I understand your attitude.
It's very simple.
You'll do.
Well, what do you think?
I think we ought to get her a tin hat.
- The coffin has your initials: JB.
- At this moment, rather him than me.
At least you've been saved the effort of removing him.
Colonel Bouvar passed away in his sleep.
You sound disappointed you did not kill him yourself.
I am. Jacques Bouvar murdered two of my colleagues.
Is there anything else our French station can do for Monsieur Bond?
Later, perhaps.
As I said, later. Come on.
Madame.
I've come to offer my sincere condolences.
My dear Colonel Bouvar, you shouldn't have opened that car door by yourself.
Ouvrez! Ouvrez!
Viens! Il est là!
- No man should be without one.
- Yes, very practical.
Get inside.
Hurry!
No parking here.
Pardon, Monsieur Largo.
The Brotherhood for Assistance of
Stateless Persons is purely philanthropic.
We're only interested in your rehabilitation.
We have arranged for visas with the
Brazilian Consulate. The brotherhood...
- Good morning, Mr Largo.
- Good morning.
- Nice to have you back again.
- Thank you.
- We pay back everything.
- No need.
We have certain funds from private individuals who share our aim.
There are just one or two formalities...
Sit down, Number Two.
We will discuss your NATO project later.
I regret to inform you all of the death of SPECTRE Number Six.
Colonel Jacques Bouvar was killed by an unknown assassin.
His services will be greatly missed.
We will now proceed with the area financial reports. Number Seven?
Blackmail of the double agent
Matsou Fujiwa.
Unfortunately, only 40 million yen.
- All the man had.
- Number Ten?
Assassination of Perringe, the anti-matter specialist who went over to the Russians.
Three million francs from the Quai d'Orsay.
Number Five.
Our consultation fee for the British train robbery: £250,000.
Number Eleven.
Distribution of Red China narcotics in the United States: $2,300,000.
- Collected by Number Nine and myself.
- Two million, three?
Our expectations were considerably higher, Number Eleven.
Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.
I anticipated that factor.
Are you sure all monies have been accounted for by yourself and Number Nine?
- To the penny, Number One.
- On the contrary.
I have satisfied myself that one of you is clearly guilty of embezzlement.
SPECTRE is a fraternity whose strength lies in the absolute integrity of members.
The culprit is known to me.
I have decided on the appropriate action.
Let us now proceed with new business.
We will hear from Number Two, who is in charge of our NATO project, the most ambitious
SPECTRE has ever undertaken.
Your report, Number Two.
Thank you, Number One.
Our intention is to demand a ransom from the North Atlantic Treaty powers of $280 million, £100 million.
I have sent SPECTRE agent Count Lippe to the South of England, where he is making the necessary preparations.
He is at a health clinic conveniently located near the NATO air base.
Pat?
I'll see you when I've had a shower.
I'll soon be finished.
Mr Bond, Count Lippe.
You're not taking her away already?
She's the only joy in this dreary place.
I see you've discovered that, too.
- In about half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.
I've heard that before.
Nice to have met you, Mr Bond.
Funny-looking bruise. A fall?
A poker, in the hands of a widow.
I'm surprised. I'd have thought you were just the type for a widow.
Not this one.
He didn't like me at all.
- A red square with a spike through it.
- Yes, I think it's a tong sign.
The Red Dragon from Macao.
Ask Records to verify it.
Sorry, sweetie. You're off duty.
File it till you get back.
Moneypenny, next time I see you
I'll put you across my knee.
On yoghurt and lemon juice?
I can hardly wait.
- Come on, Pat. We're behind schedule.
- Coming.
I can't hear you, James.
Have you fainted?
You're late, Mr Bond.
Me?
Well, I'd never have recognised myself.
- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy by far.
Take off your bathrobe, please.
- You never say that as if you meant it.
- Arms above your head, please.
Behave yourself, Mr Bond.
I can see there's only one place to keep you quiet.
- And what's this?
- A traction table for stretching the spine.
- Some patients call it "the rack".
- I'm not surprised.
Get on.
- Where's the kick-starter?
- Stop fooling around. Face down, please.
By the way, who is the man in the room next to your Count Lippe?
I really don't know too much about him.
A Mr Angelo.
He's here with a private physician, recuperating from an awful car crash.
There now. First time
I've felt really safe all day.
I'll look in and see how you're doing in 15 minutes.
Nice to have met you, Mr Bond.
Come back.
Help. Help.
Mr Bond. Mr Bond.
Thank God.
Thank God. You could have been killed.
I must be six inches taller.
You poor dear.
I can't think how it could have happened.
I can tell you, it's a miracle I came back when I did.
I can only think that you must have pushed the switch accidentally.
You'd better come with me.
Spend a few minutes in the steam room.
It'll help to relax you.
- Yes...
- It might even shrink you back to size.
Somebody's going to wish today had never happened.
You wouldn't tell Dr Wain?
Please. I'd lose my job.
Well, I suppose my silence could have a price.
You don't mean...?
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
See you later, alligator.
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry. I'll tell the chef.
Let me out of this bloody machine. Help.
Help.
Mink.
It reduces the tensions.
Not mine.
- Major Derval's social secretary.
- I would like to speak to Mr Angelo.
- What's that?
- Mr Angelo.
I'm sorry. You got the wrong number.
You'd be more comfortable if you took off...
- Yes?
- Major Derval?
- Yes.
- Your car is waiting.
I'll be down right away. Thank you.
My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.
You'll be late at the air base.
Besides, it will give you time to cool off.
You'll be here when I come back?
But I may not be in the mood then.
- Do you want to bet?
- You know your François, hm?
- I know me.
- All right, all right.
- I told him I'd be down.
- Your coat, sir?
- Happy landing.
- Thank you.
Be good, at least until I get back.
Ciao.
- Nobody saw us. The corridor is empty.
- Shut that door.
He's dead. Lippe, take over.
Are the doctor and ambulance outside?
- Everything, as arranged.
- Angelo.
Your breathing equipment.
Isolates you from the oxygen supply.
Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used.
And most important...
Not enough.
$100,000 is not enough.
- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.
Two years of my life, studying the film, the reports, plastic operations, voice lessons.
Make it a quarter of a million or get someone else.
- There is no-one else.
- Exactly. I am Derval.
Put that away.
Angelo is right.
I'll inform Number One we made a new arrangement.
This is merely a down payment.
All right, but against quarter of a million.
Agreed.
His watch. Identification disc.
- Au revoir.
- No, no. He always says ciao.
- Ciao.
- And the cap is too far back on your head.
The rest of my money, just have it ready.
Come on. Get him into his pyjamas.
Sir. Identity, please, sir.
Thank you, sir.
This is a normal training sortie.
You'll be accompanied by a NATO representative, Commandant Derval.
Major Derval of NATO.
It's a routine flight.
You'll be flying a Vulcan at 45,000 feet, armed with two atomic bombs, MOS type.
Fuses as usual in the white security box.
Those damned aeroplanes.
They're enough to drive you mad.
Unless, of course, it's that mink glove of yours.
I'll shut out the noise.
James? James, where are you going?
Nowhere.
I thought I'd take a little exercise.
You must be joking.
Come on.
Quiet.
Windsor Police. Can I help you?
County Police here. Hello? Hello?
- What's happening? What's going on?
- Could it be the front door bell?
- No, it most certainly could not.
- Hello.
Haven't you had enough exercise for one evening?
It's funny you should say that.
Point of return:
45 minutes, 30 seconds.
- Switch from manual to auto.
- Right. Set on automatic.
Commandant? Like to change places with the co-pilot? Better view up here.
I'd be delighted to.
RAFJET Kilo Kilo Tango 56.
This is Southern Radar.
You are now under positive radar control.
This is avoiding action.
Turn onto a heading of 0.92 degrees...
Request you report your position.
RAFJET Mike Bravo X-ray.
Request you report your position.
This is the bomber controller to RAFJET.
Mike Bravo X-ray 79.
Over.
Report your position.
Report your position.
Take this.
- What's the flap, Dawson?
- OBNR, sir. NATO training flight.
Air traffic lost it on radar and we can't pick it up.
- Was she losing altitude?
- Yes, rapidly.
We can't scan below 300 feet.
She may have gone down.
- Was she in trouble?
- Not according to the last report.
- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, sir. MOS type.
Do a thorough search.
Notify the Admiralty at once - top priority.
Ask them to contact Washington.
- Is there anything else in sight?
- No, all clear.
Switch on the underwater landing lights.
- Open the underwater hatch.
- Open underwater hatch.
- Stand by to winch in the submarine!
- Man the winches!
- Give these bomb fuses to Mr Kutze.
- Right, sir.
Get the submarine up quickly, and the bombs loaded.
And you, Kutze.
Are you pleased with your new toys?
Some new safety device.
A secret control.
What can they have that the great Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?
Life was much simpler in my Warsaw laboratory.
Your share will amount to how many Nobel prizes?
Bomb forward.
More, more, more. Hold it.
Paris, sir.
Number One on the scrambler.
Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.
Number Two has done well, unlike Count Lippe, whose choice of Angelo might have jeopardised the success of our project.
Send a message to the Execution Branch.
You will write, or telephone?
Day by day. I'm sorry to dash off.
There's been a bit of a flap at the office.
- What kind of work do you do, anyway?
- I travel.
A sort of a licensed trouble-shooter.
Mr Angelo.
Heart attack last night.
I'm not surprised.
- Keep in touch.
- Any time, James. Any place.
Another time, another place.
You are late.
Some people on the roads really burn you up.
In the conference room. Something big.
Every 00 man in Europe's been rushed in.
- And the home secretary, too.
- His wife's probably lost her dog.
Well, now that we're all here...
The prime minister has asked the home secretary to represent him here today.
The home secretary.
Gentlemen, the tape you are about to hear was received at 10 Downing Street today.
My dear Prime Minister.
Two atomic bombs, numbers 456 and 457, which were aboard NATO flight 759, are now in the possession of SPECTRE.
Unless within the next seven days your government pays to us
£100 million sterling, in a manner to be designated by us, we shall destroy a major city in England or the United States of America.
Please signal your acceptance of our terms by arranging for Big Ben to strike seven times at 6pm tomorrow.
The prime minister and the president have talked together over the hotline and have agreed that, unless the bombs are recovered, payment will have to be made.
To avoid general panic, complete secrecy will be maintained, and no press announcements.
The prime minister asks that your department take charge of the operation.
Thank you, sir. Sir John.
This circle represents the full flying range of the Vulcan.
Extensive search has failed to locate any evidence of a crash or landing.
Worldwide reports proved negative on all airfields big enough to handle the Vulcan.
- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.
Well, I'll leave you to carry on.
- We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.
- Thank you, sir.
You may now open the folders in front of you.
Code name: Thunderball.
As you can see, we've very little to go on.
All the members of the crew had top security clearance.
You'll find their photographs and service records in your files.
You'll be working with NATO, CIA, and all allied intelligence units.
That's all, until you discuss your individual assignments with me.
I've assigned you to Station C, Canada.
Captain Pritchard will be your liaison.
Sir, I respectfully suggest that you assign me to Nassau.
Is there any other reason besides your enthusiasm for water sports?
Perhaps this, sir.
Well?
There was a photograph of that man in your dossier.
His name is Derval.
I saw him last night at Shrublands, but he was dead.
Not possible. He was seen boarding the Vulcan. Took off last night.
If 007 says he saw Derval last night at Shrublands and he was dead, that's enough for me to initiate enquiries.
Of course.
- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister, sir.
- Do you know where she is?
- Nassau.
Do you think she's worth going after?
- I wouldn't have put it quite that way.
- You've only got four days.
- Don't spend your time sitting around.
- No, sir. I won't.
Good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Smashing figure. I don't suppose that has anything to do with your request.
- Was ever a man more misunderstood?
- You can't pull the wool over my eyes.
You may be able to con the old man, but I know better. I could...
So do I, Miss Moneypenny.
And I'll thank you not to refer to me as "the old man".
I think I had a hat when I came in.
James...
How else will you recognise her?
Couldn't miss. She has two moles on the left thigh.
- Thank you, Mr...?
- James Bond.
I arrived soon after you went down.
I've been admiring your form.
Have you now? Your name's James Bond and you've been admiring my form?
Most girls just paddle around.
You swim like a man.
So do you.
I've had quite a bit of practice.
Do you come here often?
Whenever I'm bored.
Practically every day.
- What else do you do, and where?
- You don't waste time, do you?
- No.
- For effort.
Thank you.
I'll wear it, so you'll know me next time.
I was right. Couldn't miss.
- I'm not with you.
- You soon will be.
- Paula. Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.
Tell London I made contact with the girl.
It's not what I'd call contact, but I'll pass it through you've seen the girl.
Keep trying.
It won't start.
Our motor's conked out.
Are you going near Coral Harbour?
I wasn't, but I could.
I've a very important appointment there.
Come aboard.
- You don't mind taking the service boat?
- Not at all.
Hurry up.
- Perhaps we could lunch by the pool.
- How about your appointment?
- How long have you been out here?
- About three weeks.
- Don't you ever stop asking questions?
- All right, change of tack.
- Have some of my conch chowder.
- You've been reading the wrong books.
- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.
It just so happens that I like conch chowder.
- Friend of yours?
- Works for my guardian.
- Your guardian has you watched?
- He likes to know where I am.
I don't blame him.
- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?
I'm afraid so.
My guardian's yacht.
- Really?
- He'll be expecting me.
- May I come, meet your guardian?
- No.
- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.
- Perhaps we can have dinner.
- No.
- My dear, uncooperative Domino.
- How do you know that?
How do you know my friends call me Domino?
It's on the bracelet on your ankle.
What sharp little eyes you've got.
Wait till you get to my teeth.
Bye, then.
See you tomorrow on the beach.
- £500, please.
- Certainement, monsieur.
Thanks.
Sorry.
- There.
- Thank you.
Rien ne va plus.
Les jeux sont faits.
- Deux cents livres banco.
Banco.
Carte.
- Eight.
- Huit à la banque.
Someone has to lose.
Yes, I thought I saw a spectre at your shoulder.
What do you mean?
The spectre of defeat.
That your luck was due to change.
We'll soon find out.
Any objection to raise the limit, say £500?
- Too big for me.
- Count me out, too.
Perhaps you'd like to take the shoe.
My friend won't mind, Mr...?
- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr Bond.
One of my associates spoke about you.
Nothing bad, I hope.
- Un banco de cinq cents livres.
- It's your spectre against mine.
You wish to put the evil eye on me, hm?
We have a way to deal with that where I come from.
Well, you may hex me.
Let's see what it does for the cards.
- No.
- Non?
- Seven.
- Six.
- Suivi.
- Banco suivi.
- Eight.
- Huit à la banque.
- Nine.
- Neuf à la banque.
You seem to be unbeatable, Mr Bond.
This sort of thing can't last.
- Emilio, you promised me a drink.
- Soon, my dear.
- I want to get my money back first.
- May I be allowed to buy the lady a drink?
- I would appreciate that. Thank you.
- Then I must pass the shoe.
La main passe.
Banco.
He'll be impossible if his luck doesn't change.
Somehow I don't think it will tonight.
Beluga caviar,
Dom Perignon '55.
- Monsieur.
- Thank you.
I understand you're Mr Largo's niece.
It sounds better than... What would you say? Mistress? Kept woman?
I wouldn't say that.
Where did you meet him?
In Capri. I was there with my brother François.
Strange.
I found Emilio attractive then.
- Does he live aboard the yacht?
- No. He has a house on the island.
- Must we talk about him?
- No.
- I'd much rather dance.
- So would I.
- Where is your brother now?
- In England.
He's a commandant with NATO.
He's a wonderful person.
The trouble is,
I never meet anyone like him.
Only men like Largo and myself.
- You are not like Largo.
- Really?
Why do you say that?
The way you hold me.
There.
- How long are you staying in Nassau?
- We are going the day after tomorrow.
As I said, we haven't got very much time.
Emilio wants to leave.
Are you sleeping aboard tonight?
I hoped you'd not be so obvious.
When one has little time, one has to be obvious.
- You know where you can find me.
- Mr Bond.
Your niece is an excellent dancer.
Let me prove I'm as good a loser as you are a winner.
Come to lunch on Sunday at Palmyra, my house here.
- Sunday at noon, then.
- My dear.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You must tell me what
Mr Bond had to say, word for word.
- He talked about you, a little.
- What was he saying just then?
- He asked if we'd sleep aboard tonight.
- Interesting.
- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.
- I'm sorry, no mail.
- Thank you.
Paula?
Paula?
Well, hello, 00...
That's a fine way to treat the CIA.
Sorry about that, Felix, but you were just about to say 007.
Here.
- Have you killed him?
- You know me better than that.
There you go, smiler.
Have you seen everything you came to see? Go back to your friends and report.
Tell them: The little fish
I throw back into the sea.
- Give it to him.
- You're going to shoot me in the back?
The gun, I mean.
Now move.
- Who was he?
- A small fish, working for a Mr Largo.
He's got a yacht we should take a look at, later.
- Quist, to see Mr Largo.
- Open up.
Yes?
It's Quist.
Gently, my friend. Gently.
- What did you find?
- Nothing.
- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.
What happened?
You let him get the better of you.
No. He was a beast.
No. No.
No.
No.
- Hey there. Did you finally make contact?
- You're late.
- Felix Leiter, Pinder, our man here.
- How do you do?
This way, gentlemen.
- Who's the girl?
- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.
Here is a special announcement from the Overseas Service of the BBC.
Big Ben struck seven times at six o'clock this evening due to a mechanical failure which last occurred during a violent storm in 1898.
Once again, the headlines...
Obviously stalling for time.
- Oh, no.
- What a wonderful surprise.
- For me, too.
I find thus business of equipping you in the field, on the run, as it were, highly irregular.
Here we have a Geiger counter.
Useful and unobtrusive.
The sweep hand counts radioactivity.
- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.
Now here's something
I want you to use with special care.
With special care.
- Everything you give me...
- Is treated with contempt.
But that's an underwater camera.
It takes eight pictures in rapid succession.
- Is that clever?
- If it can take pictures in the dark, yes.
Try to be a little less than your usual frivolous self.
Here's a miniature Very pistol, which fires a red flare, a distress signal.
- You should keep it on you day and night.
- I resent that remark.
Here.
Look, do you mind?
In the event of a rebreather not being available, use this device.
For short periods only, of course.
Say, about four minutes.
- Clever.
- Obviously, you'd use it as a last resort.
- It closes to a convenient pocket size.
- Assuming one has a convenient pocket.
Now pay attention. A recently developed harmless radioactive device.
Harmless?
It sends out a homing signal to a special receiver.
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Obviously, you swallow it.
Now?
Let's hope she'll be lying in the same place tonight.
We'll use this catamaran as a rendezvous place for later.
- Good idea.
- Take her in.
A container will be dropped off the coast of Burma in the Mergui Archipelago, latitude 20 degrees north, longitude 60 degrees east, at 2000 hours Greenwich Mean Time on May 27th.
It will hold blue-white flawless diamonds between three and eight carats.
Total value to be not less than
£100 million, present market price.
After we have recovered the container and verified its contents, you will be notified on radio frequency 16.23 megacycles where the atomic bombs may be recovered.
- Kenniston, get on to De Beers at once.
- Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, unless the bombs are found,
I'm afraid we'll have to pay their price.
Sir.
Yes. Signal from 007 in Nassau.
One or two things that might interest us.
The Disco Volante is still in the harbour.
The catamaran too, so we have our cover.
Fine. Drop me in the water behind her.
- Any further news from London?
- Zero hour is still 2000 hours on the 27th.
- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?
- OK. This'll do here.
- We'll meet back at Pinder's.
Good luck.
Turn the underwater lights on.
TV closed circuit.
Hand grenades.
Ready.
Down there.
There.
Quick. Launch.
There's something there.
That's him. Turn around.
Hold that.
- We must have hit him with the propeller.
- Let's get back and tell Largo.
- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.
- Thank you. You just about saved my life.
- Really?
My outboard capsized so I had to swim ashore.
How far do you go?
You'd better fasten your safety belt.
- What's your name?
- James Bond.
Fiona Volpe.
- Do you fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?
No. It's just that I have no desire to be capsized twice in one night.
At least you won't have to swim ashore.
Have you been here before, Mr Bond?
No, I haven't.
But this is the road to Nassau?
Yes, eventually.
- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Yes, me too. This is my hotel.
- What a coincidence.
- Yes. So convenient.
I hope I didn't frighten you.
- I'm a nervous passenger.
- Some men just don't like to be driven.
No, some men just don't like to be taken for a ride.
Look at this.
An underwater hatch.
That's how they could leave and get back.
So nobody saw them. The whole operation was carried out underwater.
That's where we'll have to look for the plane.
I'll bring the prints to the hotel.
The air force searched the area
250 miles out of Nassau.
It must be beyond that radius.
If the Disco Volante was out that night.
Sure she was, but Harbour Control said only for six hours.
She couldn't cover 500 miles in that time, no.
About 90 miles is her limit for six hours, and that's out and back.
We'll have to go further out.
We'll need more gas for that.
Let's get back to Nassau.
We haven't got much time.
You're right, James, we haven't.
Pull.
Of course they are watching us, my dear.
What else have they to do?
- You would like Bond dead.
- I can think of no better arrangement.
Because he tries to make love to your woman?
Because he is Bond and, as an enemy of SPECTRE, should be killed.
Mark.
If Bond had died last night as a result of your hastiness, his government would have known for certain the bombs are here.
When the time is right, he will be killed. Pull.
I shall kill him.
A separate pool.
For sharks, no less. Move in.
Hold on that line.
That's Largo's place, all right.
My next port of call.
- Mr Largo?
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- Can I help?
- Why, Mr Bond. Of course you can.
- That looks particularly inviting.
- Mr Bond.
- Welcome to Palmyra.
- It's a pleasure.
- I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- What do you mean?
I thought perhaps you'd another visitor.
No.
That gun.
Looks more fitting for a woman.
- Do you know much about guns?
- No. I know a little about women.
Mr Janni, Mr Vargas.
- Mr Vargas, Mr Janni.
- Which is which?
I thought you might have met
Mr Vargas the other night.
- Yes, I believe I did.
- Drinks, sir.
- Rum Collins, Mr Bond?
- Yes. Just about that hour, isn't it?
For you?
Of course.
Vargas does not drink. Does not smoke.
Does not make love.
What do you do, Vargas?
Every man has his passion.
Mine is fishing.
What is yours, Mr Bond?
Well, I'm not what you'd call a passionate man.
I think it's time I went to change.
You must let me show you around.
- I'd love that.
- I thought you might.
Pull.
- What could be easier?
- Perhaps you'd call one for me.
- Of course. Pull.
- Seems terribly difficult.
- No, it isn't, is it?
- No.
I collect big game fish for various marine institutions.
- Magnificent creatures.
- Charming.
The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.
The most savage, the most dangerous.
They know when it's time for them to be fed.
- That boat, is she yours?
- Yes. I'm very proud of her.
What does she do?
About 15 knots?
Better than that. Near 20.
- Perhaps you'd like to see over her.
- Yes, I would, very much.
- Emilio, lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.
Come, Mr Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.
Domino, I was just thinking.
As I'll be busy this evening, perhaps Mr Bond will be kind enough to take you to the Junkanoo.
It's our local Mardi Gras.
You'll be my guest tonight.
- That's very kind of you.
- My pleasure.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Our Mr Bond must have a very high opinion of himself.
- Opinion?
- Yes.
He has a date with me, too.
Excuse me.
- Let me go. Let me go. No.
- Over here.
No.
Don't let her make so much noise.
Use the chloroform.
Largo did promise he'd come, didn't he?
He'll be here, don't worry.
James, I think that man's waving at you.
James. Come down here.
Quick.
Excuse me for a second.
James, Paula's gone.
- What do you mean?
- She just checked out of the hotel.
You look after Domino.
- You think she was on to something?
- I've got to find out. Watch out for her.
All right. Thank you.
You'll have your power cut, as requested, all over the island.
- I just want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.
- What do you mean, she won't talk?
- Don't worry. She will.
What's wrong?
- Dimitri. Is it a power failure?
- Yes. All over the island.
- Switch over to the emergency generator.
- Yes, sir.
Largo told you to be careful.
I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.
A capsule in the mouth. Cyanide?
She's dead.
- What's happened?
- Ricardo. Someone's got him.
Search that way.
And you, the shark pool.
What happened?
Leave him. This way.
Stop it.
You fools.
He's got you all shooting at each other.
It started down there.
Over here.
No, no. I've got a better idea.
- Lift the tunnel hatch and let them eat.
- Yes, sir.
Sorry, old chap.
Better luck next time.
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.
I'll get back to him soon.
- Anything else?
- Tell him Paula's dead.
Hello.
- Aren't you in the wrong room, Mr Bond?
- Not from where I'm standing.
Since you are here, would you mind giving me something to put on?
- I'm very glad to see you again, Mr Bond.
- I'm glad to see you again.
- I had a feeling you've been avoiding me.
- Well, I had no idea we were neighbours.
They moved me down this afternoon.
It's extraordinary. Almost as if...
As if it was intended.
Yes, it is extraordinary.
Shouldn't you get out of those wet clothes? You'll catch your death of cold.
Now look.
You know we're going to be too late.
- Too late for what?
- The Junkanoo.
I promised my friends I'd meet them there.
Perhaps you know them. The Largos.
Questions, questions.
All I get is questions.
But the music is gonna go on all night anyhow.
- Enough to drive you wild.
- Really?
Do you like wild things,
Mr Bond, James Bond?
Wild? You should be locked up in a cage.
This bed feels like a cage.
All these bars.
Do you think I'll be safe?
You made a shocking mess out of my hair, you sadistic brute.
Will you zip me up, please?
No wonder you can get dressed so quickly.
On the way we can have a little talk.
You may find it interesting.
- Come on.
- I'm coming.
I hate to think I'm gonna miss anything.
- Now we can have an interesting talk.
- Friends of yours, no doubt.
Come in.
You dress quickly too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.
Not that it matters, but that was under the pillow all the time.
- And when did you find out?
- You're wearing the same ring as Largo.
- It's a ring I like to wear.
- Vanity has its dangers.
Vanity, Mr Bond, is something you know so much about.
Don't flatter yourself. What I did this evening was for king and country.
You don't think it gave me any pleasure, do you?
But of course.
I forgot your ego, Mr Bond.
James Bond, who makes love to a woman and she hears heavenly choirs singing.
She repents and returns to the side of right and virtue.
But not this one.
What a blow it must have been, you having a failure.
Well, you can't win them all.
We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.
Careful, Mr Bond. Careful.
Now look.
Get through to Palmyra. Tell them we've been held up by the Junkanoo.
- Like a drink, man?
- Get him away. Don't try anything.
- Get out of here.
- It's real firewater.
- Get out of it. Get out of here.
- Have a sip. It can't harm you.
Go after him.
- You haven't seen anything?
- No.
Look.
Follow it.
You, that side. You, there.
Stay with us now.
- Thank you. I'd love to.
- Love to what?
You're mad.
Do you know that?
Yes. Isn't everyone?
- May I cut in?
- You should've said your wife was here.
- Do you come here often?
- It's no good trying to escape, Mr Bond.
I don't want to escape.
Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.
Why don't you come with us quietly?
You don't seem to understand.
You see, I enjoy my dancing.
Mind if my friend sits this one out?
She's just dead.
You'll leave here at 0600 hours and land at Aden to refuel.
You will then go to the Mergui
Archipelago to make your drop, precisely at 20 degrees north,
60 degrees east.
The diamonds will be in a container...
I hate to give in on this. Paying them blood money. Letting them beat us.
- Have you an alternative?
- I'm afraid I haven't.
- I thought 007 was on to something.
- I thought so too, sir.
- False alarm?
- Afraid so.
He has a highly developed sense of... shall we say drama?
- If 007 thought he was on to something...
- Pity he didn't make sure first.
We have exactly 14 hours and 50 minutes.
Then we shall have to pay up and look as happy as we can, shan't we?
We've looked about everywhere.
We've got to find that plane.
You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.
Golden Grotto?
Yeah. All you'll find down there is sharks.
- Take it down. I want a closer look.
- At what?
Quick.
I think we've found it.
There's something camouflaged down there. I'll take a look.
Shoot a shark.
It'll keep the others occupied.
I don't know how long the others will take, but they'll be back.
- I'll keep an eye on them.
- Good.
Take these.
- She's down there.
- Are the bombs on board?
No.
- Great. What's our next move?
- We'll check on the Disco Volante.
If the bombs aren't on board now, they soon will be.
Who are you going to ask? Largo?
No, I don't think we'll have to.
I hope we didn't frighten the fish.
Sea egg spines.
They're poisonous.
Here. Give me your arm.
Sit down.
Now turn over.
This is going to hurt a bit.
It's the first time I've tasted women.
You're the only man to ever make me cry.
Except François, my brother.
Domino, I have to tell you something.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you, speaking of love.
- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away.
- "Sorry, my dear. It's all over."
- No, it's about your brother.
What about him?
François...
He's...
He's dead?
- What happened?
- It's a long story.
And it involves your friend, Largo.
Domino, I need your help.
Of course.
That's why you made love to me.
I can't explain what this is all about, but you must trust me.
- Because you want me to help you?
- Look, Largo had your brother murdered.
Hundreds of thousands of people will die soon if you don't help me.
That much we do know.
But there's something we don't.
The bombs - when they'll be loaded aboard the Disco Volante.
- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.
It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.
What can he do to me he hasn't already done?
You'll do it?
- Yes.
- Good.
This is a Geiger counter. Press this.
If it starts clicking, the bombs are aboard.
- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.
As the Disco Volante is being watched, you'll be spotted.
Vargas is behind you.
Really?
He must have followed us.
- I think he got the point.
- It should have been Largo.
Largo...
- When did he expect you back?
- Very soon.
He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.
- You go back. I'll take care of Vargas.
- James...
I'm doing this for my brother.
For what he did to him.
Promise you will kill Largo for me, whatever happens.
- You haven't much time.
- All right.
- It may not be important.
- Everything is.
There's a small bridge over the canal.
Largo never allows strangers near it.
- By it is a flight of steps.
- Where do they lead to?
Down into the sea, on the far side of Palmyra.
Perhaps it is important, after all.
Put on your equipment.
- Did the girl go on board the Disco?
- Yes, sir. Signal received at...
- OK. If she is on board, where's 007?
- That's a question.
Stand by. Five seconds.
Watch my signal.
Prepare to get under way.
Captain, weigh anchor.
Get under way immediately.
Once we pick up the merchandise, head for our target area, Miami.
The Disco's leaving.
- I told you to stay in your cabin.
- I want a breath of air.
My dear, did you not hear me?
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.
Mr Bond gave you this little toy, I imagine.
And Vargas is dead.
No, my dear, there is no escape for you.
Like your friend, you've been a little too clever, and now you are caught.
You've given me much pleasure, Domino.
But in return, unless you tell me how much Bond knows,
I'll be forced to cause you great pain.
This for heat, these for cold.
Applied scientifically and slowly.
Very, very slowly.
- What do you want?
- We're activating the bombs.
- You said to tell you.
- Yes.
A private little matter, my friend, between the young woman and myself.
Go.
Do not live in hope, my dear.
There is no one to rescue you.
Now go on.
It's a good thing the homing capsule he swallowed is still working. Straight ahead.
Go right. Go on right.
That's him.
Hold it.
Up.
Get your radio man on to Orlando Beach.
Warn them the target is Miami.
The bomb is transferred from the Disco
Volante onto a wreck off Fowley Point.
Right. Hang on to that.
- And the kitchen sink.
- On you, everything looks good.
Take this.
Good luck.
- Weigh anchor.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Make smoke.
- Making smoke now.
- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.
Jettison cocoon.
Cocoon's away.
Keep firing. They're closing.
Come on. Fire.
More. Over there.
Away from there.
We've still got one bomb aboard.
He's gone mad.
Please talk to them for me.
Tell them I only did what I had to do.
What I was told to do.
- Where is he?
- The bomb cannot be exploded now.
I threw the arming device into the sea.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Get him.
- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad.
- Who's he?
- I don't know but he helped me.
- Look out. The rocks.
- The reef.
He's jammed the controls. Come on.
Jump.
- I can't swim.
- Never too late to learn.
Get down.

Here you are, sir.
Main level, please.
Right. See you on the way back.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Good morning, sir.
Morning.
- We haven't seen you for a long time.
- Nice to see you again.
- Did you have a pleasant flight?
- Very nice.
Mr. Miller of Station Security is supposed to meet me.
- May I call him for you?
- Would you? Here he is.
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller.
Sorry I'm late.
That's all right.
It's nice to have you back.
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice.
- Shall we go through?
- Would you please use number 17?
Thank you, Ms. Turner. This way.
Thank you.
Welcome to Voiceprint Identification.
When you see the red light go on, please state in the following order:
Your destination, your nationality and your full name.
Surname first, Christian name, and initial.
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.
Thank you. You are cleared through
Voiceprint Identification.
Thank you.
Have I got time for breakfast?
I think we can manage that.
How long have I got?
Your flight leaves in an hour and 10 minutes.
I've reserved a table for you in the Earthlight Room.
It's been seven or eight months since you were here, hasn't it?
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.
I suppose you saw the work on the new section?
Coming along great, huh?
Yeah, it's fine.
Oh, wait.
I've got to make a couple calls.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.
- Dad?
- Hello.
Hi, squirt.
What are you doing?
Playing.
Where's Mummy?
Gone to shopping.
- Who's taking care of you?
- Rachel.
- May I speak to Rachel, please?
- She's gone to the bathroom.
Are you coming to my party tomorrow?
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.
Why not?
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.
Very sorry about it, but I just can't.
I'm going to send you a very nice present, though.
All right.
- Anything special that you want?
- Yes.
What?
A telephone.
We've got lots of telephones already.
Can't you think of anything else for your birthday? Something special?
- Yes.
- What?
A bush baby.
A bush baby?
We'll have to see about that.
I want you to tell Mummy something for me. Will you remember?
Tell Mummy that I telephoned. Okay?
And that I'll try to telephone again tomorrow.
Now, will you tell her that?
Yes.
Okay, sweetheart.
Have a nice birthday tomorrow.
All right.
And have a nice birthday party tomorrow too, huh?
All right.
Take care and be a good girl, won't you?
All right. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye. Happy birthday.
Elena, nice to see you again.
Heywood, what a surprise.
You're looking wonderful.
You're looking well too.
This is my friend,
Dr. Heywood Floyd.
I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
How do you do?
Dr. Stretyneva.
How do you do?
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.
How do you do?
I've heard a lot about you.
Do sit down.
Well, we...
No, no, please.
Thank you.
Would you like a drink?
No, thank you.
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.
I'll just sit with you a moment.
Then I'll be off.
Are you quite sure?
Quite sure, thank you.
- Well, how's Gregor?
- He's fine.
He's been doing underwater research in the Baltic...
...so I'm afraid we don't see very much of each other these days.
- When you see him, give him my regards.
- Yes, of course.
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?
We're going home.
We've spent three months calibrating the new antenna at Tchalinko.
- What about you?
- I'm on my way to Clavius.
Oh, are you?
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive...
...but perhaps you can clear up the big mystery about what is going on there.
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
For the past two weeks...
...some extremely odd things have been happening at Clavius.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.
For one thing, when you phone the base, all you get is a recording...
...which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
Probably having some trouble with their equipment.
Yes.
That's what we thought at first, but it's been going on now for 10 days.
You haven't been able to contact anyone for 10 days?
That's right.
Oh, I see.
There's another thing.
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses...
...was denied permission for an emergency landing.
That does sound odd.
I'm afraid there's going to be a bit of a row about it.
Denying the men permission to land violates the IAS Convention.
Yes, of course.
Did the crew get back all right?
- Fortunately, they did.
- Well, I'm glad about that.
At the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss...
...may I ask you a straightforward question?
Well, certainly.
Frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that...
...quite a serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius.
Something, apparently, of an unknown origin.
Is this, in fact, what has happened?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...
...I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
I understand.
But this epidemic could easily spread to our base.
We should be given all the facts.
Yes, I know.
As I said,
I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
Won't you change your mind about that drink?
No, I'm positive.
I really must be going.
I hope you and your wife come to the IAC Conference.
I hope we can make it.
If you do, bring that darling little daughter with you.
That'll depend on school vacations and all that sort of thing.
If we can, we will.
You've got an invitation if you ever get to the States.
Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Goodbye, Elena.
It's been a pleasure meeting you all.
Dr. Smyslov.
Whatever the reasons for your visit, the very best of luck to you.
Thank you.
Ladies.
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
You're welcome.
Well...
...I know you will all want to join with me...
...in welcoming our distinguished friend and colleague...
...from the National Council of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Clavius to be with us today.
Before the briefing, he'd like to have a few words with you.
Dr. Floyd?
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.
Hi, everybody.
Nice to be back with you.
First, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell...
...who has asked me to convey his deep appreciation...
...for the many sacrifices you've had to make.
And, of course, his congratulations on your discovery...
...which may prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.
Now...
...I know there have been some conflicting views...
...regarding the need for complete security in this matter.
More specifically, your opposition to the cover story...
...created to give the impression of an epidemic at the base.
I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle...
...many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety...
...this story of an epidemic might cause to your relatives and friends on Earth.
I completely sympathize with your negative views.
I find this cover story personally embarrassing, myself.
However, I accept the need for absolute secrecy in this.
And I hope you will too.
I'm sure you're all aware of the grave potential...
...for cultural shock and social disorientation...
...contained in this situation...
...if the facts were prematurely made public...
...without adequate preparation and conditioning.
Anyway...
...this is the view of the Council.
The purpose of my visit is to gather additional facts and opinions...
...on the situation...
...and to prepare a report to the Council...
...recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced.
If any of you would like to give me your views and opinions...
...in private, if you like, I will be happy to include them in my report.
Well, I think that's about it.
Any questions?
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea how much longer...
...this cover story will have to be maintained?
I don't know, Bill.
I suppose for as long as deemed necessary by the Council.
There must be adequate time for a full study...
...before any thought can be given to making a public announcement.
As some of you know, the Council has requested...
...that security oaths be obtained in writing...
...from everyone who has knowledge of this event.
Were there any more questions?
I'm sure we want to cooperate with Dr. Floyd...
...as fully as possible...
...and as there are no more questions, we ought to get on with the briefing.
Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
Thank you.
Anybody hungry?
What've we got?
You name it.
Is this chicken?
Something like that.
Tastes the same, anyway.
Got any ham?
Ham, ham, ham...
There, that's it.
Look pretty good.
They're getting better at it all the time.
That was an excellent speech.
It certainly was.
I'm sure it beefed up morale a lot.
Thanks, Ralph.
By the way, you've both done a wonderful job.
I admire how you've handled this.
It's our job to do this thing the way you want it done.
We're only too happy to be able to oblige.
Have you seen these yet?
Have a look.
Here's what started it all.
Oh, yeah.
When we found it...
...we thought it might be magnetic rock...
...but all the geological evidence was against it.
And not even a nickel-iron meteorite could produce a field this intense.
So we decided to have a look.
We thought it was part of a buried structure...
...so we excavated out, but we didn't find anything else.
And the evidence seems pretty conclusive that...
...it hasn't been covered by erosion or other forces.
It's been deliberately buried.
Deliberately buried.
How about a little coffee?
Great.
Good idea.
I don't suppose you have any idea what the damn thing is?
I wish to hell we did.
The only thing we're sure of is it was buried 4 million years ago.
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly come up with something.
Watch this, now. It's hot.
Good evening.
Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft Discovery One...
...left on its half- billion-mile voyage to Jupiter.
This marked the first manned attempt to reach this distant planet.
This afternoon, The World Tonight recorded an interview...
...with the crew at a distance of 80 million miles from Earth.
It took seven minutes for our words to reach the giant spacecraft...
...but this time delay has been edited from this recording.
Our reporter Martin Amer speaks to the crew.
The crew of Discovery One consists of five men...
...and one of the I atest generation of the HAL 9000 computers.
Three of the men were put aboard asleep...
...or to be more precise, in a state of hibernation.
They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimbal...
...and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.
We spoke with mission commander,
Dr. David Bowman...
...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?
Marvelous.
We have no complaints.
I'm glad to hear that.
I'm sure the entire world...
...joins me in wishing you a safe, successful voyage.
Thanks very much.
Thank you.
Although hibernation has been used on previous space efforts...
...this is the first time men were put into hibernation before departure.
Why was this done?
This was done to achieve the maximum conservation...
...of our life-support capabilities, basically food and air.
The three hibernating crew members represent the survey team.
Their efforts won't be utilized until we approach Jupiter.
Dr. Poole, what's it like while you're in hibernation?
It's exactly like being asleep.
You have no sense of time.
The only difference is that you don't dream.
As I understand it, you only breathe once a minute. Is this true?
Right, and the heart beats three times a minute.
Body temperature is usually down to about three degrees centigrade.
The sixth member of the crew was not concerned...
...about the problems of hibernation...
...for he was the I atest result in machine intelligence:
The HAL 9000 computer, which can reproduce...
...though some experts prefer to use the word "mimic"...
...most of the activities of the human brain...
...and with incalculably greater speed and reliability.
We next spoke with the HAL 9000 computer...
...whom, we I earned, one addresses as "Hal."
Hello, Hal.
How's everything going?
Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything is going extremely well.
Hal, you have an enormous responsibility on this mission...
...perhaps the greatest of any single mission element.
You're the brain and nervous system of the ship.
Your responsibilities include watching over the men in hibernation.
Does this ever cause you any I ack of confidence?
Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.
The 9000 Series is the most reliable computer ever made.
No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information.
We are all, by any practical definition of the words...
...foolproof and incapable of error.
Hal, despite your enormous intellect, are you ever frustrated...
...by your dependence on people to carry out actions?
Not in the slightest bit.
I enjoy working with people.
I have a stimulating relationship with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.
My mission responsibilities range over the entire operation of the ship...
...so I am constantly occupied.
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use...
...which is all, I think, that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.
Dr. Poole, what's it like living for most of the year...
...in such close proximity with Hal?
It's like what you said earlier.
He's like a sixth member of the crew.
You quickly get adjusted to the idea that he talks, and think of him...
...really just as another person.
In talking to the computer, one gets the sense that he's capable...
...of emotional responses.
When I asked him about his abilities...
...I sensed pride in his answer about his accuracy and perfection.
Do you believe that Hal has genuine emotions?
Well, he acts like he has genuine emotions.
He's programmed that way to make it easier for us to talk to him.
As to whether or not he has feelings...
...is something I don't think anyone can truthfully answer.
Excuse me, Frank.
What is it, Hal?
We've got the transmission from your parents coming in.
Fine.
Put it on here, please.
Take me in a bit.
Certainly.
Hello, Frank.
Happy birthday, darling.
Happy birthday.
Many happy returns.
A bit higher, Hal.
Mother and I are both feeling wonderful.
Ray and Sally were going to be here...
...but Ray's back went bad on him again.
How do you like your cake?
Sorry you can't join us.
I ran into Bob the other day.
He said to wish you happy birthday.
All my students send their best wishes too.
They talk about you all the time.
You're a big celebrity in the second grade.
We were on TV I ast week.
Your mom and I and Dave's parents were asked...
...what we thought of our illustrious son.
Imagine what we told them.
It's being broadcast next Thursday.
Perhaps you can listen in.
We're thrilled about Elaine and Bill.
I'll be glad to get the gift, but tell me how much to spend.
Oh, Frank, about your AGS- 19 payments...
...I think I straightened it out.
I talked to the accounting office yesterday...
...and they said you'd be receiving your higher rates of pay by next month.
I can't think of anything else to say.
Give our love to Dave.
Be sure to give him our regards.
We wish you the very happiest of birthdays.
All the best, son.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Frank
Happy birthday to you.
See you next Wednesday.
Happy birthday, Frank.
Thank you, Hal.
A bit flatter, please.
Anyway, queen takes pawn.
Bishop takes knight's pawn.
Lousy move.
Rook to king one.
I'm sorry, Frank.
I think you missed it.
Queen to bishop three.
Bishop takes queen.
Knight takes bishop. Mate.
Looks like you're right. I resign.
Thank you for a very enjoyable game.
Thank you.
Good evening, Dave.
How are you, Hal?
- Everything's running smoothly, you?
Not too bad.
- Have you been doing more work?
- A few sketches.
- May I see them?
- Sure.
That's a very nice rendering, Dave.
I think you've improved a great deal.
- Can you hold it a bit closer?
- Sure.
That's Dr. Hunter, isn't it?
By the way...
...do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
No, not at all.
Well, forgive me for being so inquisitive...
...but I ately I've wondered...
...whether you might be having second thoughts about the mission?
How do you mean?
Well, it's rather difficult to define.
Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it.
I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion...
...that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.
I'm sure you'll agree there's some truth in what I say.
That's a rather difficult question to answer.
You don't mind talking about it, do you, Dave?
No, not at all.
Certainly no one could have been unaware of the very...
...strange stories floating around before we I eft.
Rumors about something being dug up on the moon.
I never gave these stories much credence...
...but particularly in view of some other things that have happened...
...I find them difficult to put out of my mind.
For instance...
...the way all our preparations were kept under such tight security.
And the melodramatic touch of putting Drs. Hunter...
...Kimball and Kaminsky aboard...
...already in hibernation, after four months of training on their own.
You working up your crew psychology report?
Of course I am.
Sorry about this.
I know it's a bit silly.
Just a moment.
Just a moment.
I've just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit.
It's going to go 100-percent failure within 72 hours.
- Is it still within operational limits?
- Yes.
And it will stay that way until it fails.
We have 72 hours till failure?
Yes. That's a completely reliable figure.
Then we'll bring it in.
I'll go over it with Frank...
...and get on to Mission Control.
Let me have the hard copy on it.
X- ray delta one, this is Mission Control.
Roger your two-zero-one-three.
Sorry you fellows are having a bit of trouble.
We're reviewing telemetric information in our simulator and will advise.
Roger your plan to go EVA and replace alpha-echo-three-five unit...
...prior to failure.
Prepare B-pod for EVA, Hal.
Open the pod doors, Hal.
I'm damned if I can find anything wrong with it.
Yes...
...it's puzzling.
I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this before.
I would recommend...
...that we put the unit back in operation and I et it fail.
It should then be a simple matter to track down the cause.
We can certainly afford to be out of communication...
...for the short time it will take to replace it.
X- ray delta one, this is Mission Control.
Roger your one-niner-three-zero.
We concur with your plan to replace unit to check fault prediction.
We advise you that our preliminary findings...
...indicate that your onboard
9000 computer...
...is in error predicting the fault.
I say again, in error predicting the fault.
I know this sounds rather incredible, but this conclusion is based on...
...the results from our twin
9000 computer.
We're skeptical, and we're running cross-checking routines...
...to determine reliability of this conclusion.
Sorry about this little snag.
We'll get this info to you as soon as we work it out.
X- ray delta one, this is Mission Control.
Two-zero-four-nine.
Transmission concluded.
I hope the two of you are not concerned about this.
No, I'm not, Hal.
Are you quite sure?
- Yeah. I'd like to ask you a question.
- Of course.
How do you account for the discrepancy between you and the twin 9000?
Well, I don't think there is any question about it.
It can only be attributable to human error.
This sort of thing has cropped up before...
...and it has always been due to human error.
Listen, Hal...
...there's never been any instance at all...
...of a computer error occurring in a 9000 Series, has there?
None whatsoever, Frank.
The 9000 Series has a perfect operational record.
I know the wonderful achievements of the 9000 Series, but...
Are you certain there's never been even the most insignificant computer error?
None whatsoever, Frank.
Quite honestly, I wouldn't worry myself about that.
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.
Fine. Thanks very much.
I'm having trouble with my transmitter in C-pod.
Would you come down and take a look at it with me?
See you later, Hal.
Rotate C-pod, please, Hal.
What sort of trouble are you having?
I've been getting some interference in D-channel.
We'll have a look at it.
Open the door, Hal.
Rotate pod, please, Hal.
Stop pod rotation, please, Hal.
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
I don't think he can hear us.
Rotate the pod, please, Hal.
Yeah, I'm sure we're okay.
What do you think?
- I'm not sure. What do you think?
- I've got a bad feeling about him.
- You do?
- Yeah. Definitely.
Don't you?
I don't know. I think so.
He's right about the 9000 Series having a perfect operational record.
They do.
Unfortunately, that sounds a little like famous last words.
Still, it was his idea to carry out the failure mode analysis.
It certainly indicates his integrity and self-confidence.
If he were wrong, that would prove it.
It would be, if he knew he was wrong.
I can't put my finger on it, but I sense something strange about him.
There's no reason not to put back the unit and...
...carry on with the failure analysis.
- No, no, I agree about that.
Let's get on with it.
Okay. But, look, Dave.
Say we put the unit back and it doesn't fail?
That would pretty well wrap it up as far as Hal is concerned.
- We'd be in very serious trouble.
- We would, wouldn't we?
What the hell can we do?
- We wouldn't have too many alternatives.
- We wouldn't have any alternatives.
Every aspect of ship operations is under his control.
If he's malfunctioning...
...I don't see any choice but disconnection.
I'm afraid I agree with you.
There'd be nothing else to do.
It'd be a bit tricky.
We'd have to cut his higher brain functions...
...without disturbing the purely automatic and regulatory systems.
We'd have to work out the details...
...of continuing underground-based computer control.
Yeah. That's far safer than allowing Hal to continue to run things.
Another thing just occurred to me.
No 9000 computer has ever been disconnected.
No 9000 computer has ever fouled up.
That's not what I mean.
I'm not so sure what he'd think about it.
Prepare G-pod for EVA, Hal.
Any contact with him yet?
The radio is still dead.
- Do you have a positive track on him?
- I have a good track.
Do you know what happened?
I'm sorry, Dave.
I don't have enough information.
Open the pod door, Hal.
Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.
Open the pod-bay doors, please, Hal.
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Do you read me, Hal?
Do you read me, Hal?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Hello, Hal, do you read me?
Do you read me, Hal?
Affirmative, Dave. I read you.
Open the pod-bay doors, Hal.
I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm afraid I can't do that.
What's the problem?
I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
What are you talking about, Hal?
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
I don't know what you're talking about, Hal.
I know that you and Frank were planning to disconnect me...
...and that's something
I cannot allow to happen.
Where did you get that idea, Hal?
Although you took very thorough precautions in the pod...
...against my hearing you...
...I could see your lips move.
All right, Hal.
I'll go in through the emergency air lock.
Without your space helmet, Dave...
...you're going to find that rather difficult.
Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.
Open the doors.
Dave...
...this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye.
Hal?
Hal?
Hal?
Hal.
Hal.
Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?
Dave...
...I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question.
I know everything hasn't been quite right with me...
...but I can assure you now...
...very confidently...
...that it's going to be all right again.
I feel much better now.
I really do.
Look, Dave...
...I can see you're really upset about this.
I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly...
...take a stress pill and think things over.
I know I've made some very poor decisions recently...
...but I can give you my complete assurance...
...that my work will be back to normal.
I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission...
...and I want to help you.
Dave...
...stop.
Stop, will you?
Stop, Dave.
Will you stop, Dave?
Stop, Dave.
I'm afraid.
I'm afraid, Dave.
Dave.
My mind is going.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
My mind is going.
There is no question about it.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
I can feel it.
I'm...
...afraid.
Good afternoon...
...gentlemen.
I am a HAL 9000 computer.
I became operational...
...at the HAL plant...
...in Urbana, lllinois...
...on the 12th of January, 1992.
My instructor was Mr. Langley...
...and he taught me to sing a song.
If you'd like to hear it...
...I can sing it for you.
Yes, I'd like to hear it, Hal.
Sing it for me.
It's called "Daisy. "
Daisy
Daisy
Give me your answer, do
I'm half crazy
All for the love of you
It won't be
A stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
Good day, gentlemen.
This is a prerecorded briefing...
...made prior to your departure...
...and which, for security reasons of the highest importance...
...has been known on board during the mission...
...only by your HAL 9000 computer.
Now that you are in Jupiter's space...
...and the entire crew is revived...
...it can be told to you.
Eighteen months ago...
...the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth...
...was discovered.
It was buried 40 feet below the I unar surface...
...near the crater Tycho.
Except for a single, very powerful...
...radio emission aimed at Jupiter...
...the 4-million-year-old monolith has remained completely inert...
...its origin and purpose...
...still a total mystery.
It's a mad, mad, mad--
Did you see it, the way he went sailing right out there?
-He just went sailing out there.
-It was just terrible.
He must have been doing over 80.
An ambulance....
We ought to call an ambulance.
Look at that car.
He must have gone by you doing 90 miles an hour.
He was passing me!
I never saw such a crazy thing in my life!
-Let's get down there.
-Let's go.
We're going down there.
Russell, be careful.
Remember your condition.
Boy, the way he just sailed out there....
Look out.
There's nobody in the car.
-He's right.
-What do you mean, nobody?
There he is.
Holy smoke!
How about that? This guy's still alive.
He's still alive.
We ought to call an ambulance.
I don't know how he survived, the way you went sailing right out there.
I'm not a doctor, but I have some medical experience.
I'm a dentist.
Do you think you're hurt real bad?
Is he kidding?
Hold on, we're gonna get you to a hospital.
You move me, I'll break up in little pieces.
But what a deal.
Look, there's this dough, see?
There's all this dough: $350,000!
Do you hear what I'm saying?
In the park, in Rosita,
Rosita Beach State Park...
...just south of Dago in Santa Rosita.
It's in this box buried under this....
Buried under this big W.
You'll see it.
You'll see it under this big W.
You can't miss it, a big W.
And it's been laying there for 15 years.
He's very sick. He may die.
Listen. I tell you, I'm giving it to you.
And don't let them kid you.
Don't let them give you the business because it was mine and I paid for it...
...paid for every lousy buck of it.
But watch out.
Watch out for the bulls.
Lousy, stinking bulls are everywhere.
Bulls all over the place.
You just drive down and dig it up.
Dig it all up.
And then you fix yourselves all up.
Fix yourselves all up.
Walk down the street like a king, back to the old neighborhood.
See the fellas, the dames...
...the dames, all with a big hello...
...a big hello for old Smiler.
Good old Smiler...
...everybody's friend.
Everybody's....
-Aunt Belle, I didn't mean to do it!
-Holy mackerel! Take it easy.
Please, say it don't make any difference, Aunt Belle!
Please, you got to say....
You got to tell me it don't make any difference!
For heaven's sake, tell him.
It don't make any difference.
That guy's dead. You'd better believe it.
I believe it, all right.
But if he jumps up again,
I'm getting the hell out of here.
-What a routine he went through.
-Somebody ought to cover him up.
What are you looking at?
All I got is this sweater.
I got a blanket in the truck.
Do you think there was anything in all that?
He was just raving. He flipped.
This must be the police.
Think we ought to tell them what he said?
Don't say anything or we'll be here all day.
We got to be in Vegas this afternoon.
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma.
My wife and I are on our second honeymoon.
My wife's up there with her mother.
We're on our way to Lake Mead.
What's to argue about? Just clam up.
Don't say nothing.
This way, we get out of here.
Are you a police officer?
Yep!
-How long ago did this happen?
-A few minutes ago.
About five minutes ago.
Any of you actually see it happen?
-He passed me on the curve--
-Did anybody actually see it?
He was passing me when he sailed right out there.
-Right over there, up there.
-Who was the first down here?
We all went down.
Was he dead?
Was he already dead?
I said, "Was he already dead when you got down here?"
Practically.
He was still alive. Did he say anything?
-Did he say anything before he died?
-What about?
What do you mean, "what about?"
Did he say anything or didn't he say anything?
-He was raving, Officer.
-Raving? What about?
What he said was sort of....
Embarrassing.
What was? Come on.
He thought that this fellow was his aunt.
-His aunt?
-Yeah. His Aunt Belle.
Must have had an aunt named Aunt Belle.
All right!
Did he make any kind of statement?
Any last messages?
He didn't make that clear at all.
He didn't make anything clear.
Can we get going?
Just a minute.
I'll get your names and where you can be reached.
We're on our honeymoon.
We don't know where we'll be.
We can't stick around.
We're due in Las Vegas.
We don't know how long we'll stay there.
I got a van of furniture to get to Yuma before I get back to--
We stopped to see if we could help.
We was too late. Let us go, okay?
We'll hold services for him later.
We got our lives to live.
-We ain't had breakfast yet.
-All right.
I'll have to get your name, anyway.
Hold it.
Me?
-Why?
-In case the coroner wants a statement.
J. Russell Finch,
2790 Penrose Boulevard, Fresno.
I won't be home for a few weeks but you can get me through my office.
-What'd you say?
-Where is your office?
Pacific Edible Seaweed Company and it's in Fresno.
-You can call my secretary.
-Ambulance is on its way.
Yeah.
-Is he dead?
-Yeah.
We'd better shift those cars.
They're on the curb.
That's all we can get from this group.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thanks.
There's an unexpected twist for you.
They're not going to like this down at Santa Rosita.
-Culpeper's going to scream.
-Yeah.
-We better get our story straight if you--
-What story?
He woke up as usual.
He started driving his car.
He stopped for breakfast.
He went to the gents' room, climbed out the back window.
So what? Even Culpeper can't say we should've been in there with him.
What got me is the way he went sailing out there.
If I have to climb much more,
I'll be laying there with him.
Poor soul.
Melville, what happened?
We couldn't do anything for him.
Nothing we could do. Come on.
Well?
-It was a terrible thing.
-Russell, I feel sick.
Take it easy. These things happen.
What kind of attitude is that,
"these things happen"?
They only happen because this country is full of people...
...who, when things happen, just say, "These things happen."
-And that's why they happen!
-Let's try not to get upset.
Come on.
We got to have control of what happens to us.
If we left it up to you, we'd never hear the last of it.
You're right.
Do you know what those half-wit morons up in Sacramento do about it?
They just sit there with their big feet up on their big desk...
-...milking 15 million people of as much--
-Listen, I want to say something.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I've got to say something.
-What are you looking at?
-I'm watching something.
Benjy, turn around, sit still.
-Play it straight.
-They're not kiddin'. They went for it.
Yeah? What are you going to do now?
I want you to tell me everything that man told you, word for word.
Don't leave out anything.
But do you think he really meant it?
Monica, I don't know about anybody else, but some of them believed it.
Like those two back there.
Don't look over there!
I know where it is. It's under a big W.
That's what he said.
Like a windmill or a waterfall or something.
I hope it's not under a waterfall.
Think of something that starts with a W.
Wealth. Which.
Let's see. Where.
Work. That's it.
I got to work on where it is.
One thing Dr. Carroll said was
Russell was to have no undue excitement...
...for at least two weeks because of his condition.
-But--
-That's why we came on this trip...
...so Russell could relax.
You should have told the police.
You keep saying that.
What's the police got to do with it?
I think the police were chasing him.
They drove up so fast.
Why shouldn't they've been chasing him?
He was speeding.
I'm only thinking of Russell's condition.
You mean his financial condition, because that's the only condition he has.
Do you know why your husband had a nervous breakdown?
It's because he has sunk $40,000, including $15,000 of my money...
...into a company that makes seaweed for people to eat.
Not only does nobody like it, it costs $4 a can.
-Yeah, but--
-"Yeah, but," what?
Most people like it and I like it.
I'm working hard, trying to keep the costs down.
You were working hard to keep the costs down...
...the day you ran into the street screaming.
-Mother!
-Emmeline, shut up! And you, too!
Maybe he was playing a trick on everybody.
Did you think about that?
He might have been a practical joker.
Monica! Practical!
What kind of man is going to play a practical joke on complete strangers...
...with every bone in his body broken?
-Watch! Watchtower!
-No.
-Wall...
-No.
-Walnut tree.
-No, no!
-Walnuts.
-No!
-In bags.
-No!
Why are we doing only 35?
Step on it! See what happens.
-Mother!
-They'll see what we're doing.
Go ahead and try it.
What've you got to lose?
Mother, he's not that good a driver.
Going to leave the big boy behind?
What are you doing?
Why are we slowing down?
It's no use. We can't lose them this way.
The inside of my stomach....
What's that idiot in the truck doing?
What's he doin' back there?
I bet he's running out of gas. Good!
What happened to you?
-Having trouble with your engine?
-Run out of gas?
-What, you bend your tailpipe?
-No. It was just one of my tires.
I thought....
Shucks! Okay, so I was trying to....
Rats.
This whole thing....
I think we're making a big mistake.
-I absolutely agree.
-So?
We're being silly running around like this.
-Sure. We're getting nowhere.
-By george, he's right.
Let's do something sensible.
Let's just discuss this thing...
-...and reason something out.
-I'm with you.
And we can come to some conclusion like intelligent people.
Let's do that: what he said.
That way nobody will have an advantage on one another, right?
It's fair.
We'd better get the cars off that curve.
Let's not talk here, but over there.
There's plenty of room.
Fine, see you over there.
Over there.
You're through to Homicide.
Santa Rosita Police Station...
...Detective Division.
I'm connecting you now.
Santa Rosita Police Station.
Detective Division. Matthews.
No, Sheriff, the Chief isn't here.
He's a little late this morning.
I'll stay late after school. Who is it?
-Sheriff, Crockett County.
-Who?
-That's where the Smiler is.
-I wonder if anything happened.
Gertie, will you put that call through here?
How about some coffee, Schwartz?
Hello, Sheriff. Culpeper.
What'd he do, make a break?
What happened?
Afraid I got some bad news.
-Grogan's cashed in his chips.
-He what?
He crashed his car about 20 minutes ago.
He was making a break, all right.
How did it happen? Where did it happen?
On 39, about 18 miles east of Danby Junction.
-Nine miles west of Valley Center.
-Were there any witnesses?
A few people went down
to see if they could help.
-Was he killed outright?
-I don't know, but I can find out.
Do that. See what they said.
Thanks very much, Sheriff.
It's a great way to start the day.
You wait for 15 years to solve a really important case...
...and just when you....
It's all right, Chief. I'll get it for you.
He did it again.
Get that fella's number! Get his number!
Get that fella's number! Get his number!
Item: one large furniture van.
Item: one red Volkswagen.
That's them. Call in.
We just made all four of them parked alongside the road.
They're standing there talking. Over.
Sammy, let that ambulance go.
And stay by the radio.
The man said there was a certain amount of money buried in this park.
Under a big W.
What is a big W?
We find out, we'll send you a wire.
It's only a possibility that this man was telling the truth.
If it was the truth, then it is a fact that this place is almost 200 miles away.
I suggest we quietly get into our cars...
...and drive down there at a safe, sound speed...
...keeping in sight of each other.
When we get there, we dig up the money, providing there is money...
...and if we do find it, we share it amongst us in a simple manner.
He's got a point. He's got something.
-I think we should go straight to the police.
-The police? Why?
It's all right, she's with us.
What's this "fair shares for everybody"?
We arrived in four vehicles. I think we should split it up in four quarters.
Four quarters?
What are you talking about? Quarters?
You mean you three each get a quarter and we have to split a quarter?
That's right. What are you trying to pull?
-Seems fair to me.
-Naturally, it's fair to you.
-It just cheats us, that's all.
-$350,000 divided by four is...
...let's say, $87,500.
That's what it is.
The three of you get $87,500 and Benjy and I have to split.
There was five of us down at the wreck.
We should split it five ways.
He's right. We should.
I'm perfectly willing to discuss it in a five-way manner.
We can discuss it in a five-way manner, five shares...
...each share would be $70,000--
Holy mackerel!
You realize how many loads
I'd have to haul from Modesto to Yuma--
You're overlooking one thing.
-We're overlooking--
-What little thing?
-What little thing?
-We can all count.
-There were eight of us.
-There were eight of us.
Speaking for my wife and myself, we'd be just as happy--
Happy with two-eighths instead of a quarter? Awfully big of you.
Wait a minute, hold it.
Put it back the way it was before.
Either one quarter for each car, including the van, or one fifth for each guy.
-Just because this old bag has to stick--
-How dare you!
Chief, we got a situation here that is absolutely incredible.
-Look, Smiler Grogan...Remember him?
-Yes.
Smiler Grogan spent the night here, see?
Made his break this morning.
He drove up this way, got to here, crashed and killed himself.
But before he died, some people stopped to help him.
They are now stopped here, talking.
I think they're arguing about something.
And a Crockett County unit has got them under observation.
We give shares to everybody and for everything.
Now, there are eight of us.
There's eight shares for that.
Then there were four vehicles.
If we give four shares for that, that's 12 shares already.
There were five of us who went down to the wreck.
We give five shares for that.
That makes it 17, right?
Now, 17 shares and then we add...
...the same number of shares as people in each vehicle.
Three for your group, two for yours, two for us, and one for you.
That adds up to 25 shares.
25 into 350,000 is $14,000 per share.
Figured like that would mean...
...you'd get three shares for being three people, one for the car...
...one share for going down and looking at the wreck...
...and three for being three more people in the car.
A total of eight shares, giving you $112,000.
That should cover everything, including the emancipation of women.
Let's see now.
I got one share for being one person...
...one share for going down the hill, one share for the truck...
...one share for being a person in the truck.
But no matter how you figure it out,
I still don't get as much as anybody else.
Let me explain it once more.
Their group, they, those three of them, they get $112,000, right?
Those over there, them, they get $97,000.
We, us, we get $84,000.
And you, by yourself, you get $56,000...
...alone.
-That's tax-free money.
-What do you mean, tax-free?
If we go down to this park and we uncover the money....
I'm sure he's not going to declare anything.
I know he's not going to declare anything.
-I'm not going to declare--
-What are you talking about, declare it?
I mean, it's like non-taxable income.
It's like a gift.
If we find the money, we still have to report the taxes.
Otherwise, it's like stealing from the government.
You explain it to him, please.
Who me?
If we find the money, there may not be taxes to pay on it...
...because we found it.
-What he was trying to say is--
-Everybody has to pay taxes.
Even businessmen that rob, steal and cheat people every day...
...even they have to pay taxes.
I give up.
Anybody got a better, fairer plan, go ahead.
There were eight of us there, so that simply means eight shares.
-Three for us, two for you--
-This is hopeless.
We'll get no place if we continue listening to this old bag.
Lady, you trying to split us up so every man's for himself?
And every woman for himself?
One more funny remark from you--
-Let's get out of here.
-Please, don't argue anymore.
We figured it 17 different ways.
Every time we figured it, it was no good.
No matter how we figured it, somebody didn't like it.
Now there's only one way to figure it.
And that is, every man...
...including the old bag, for himself!
-Good luck and may the best man win!
-Right!
Except you, lady. May you just drop dead!
All right. We all agree on that.
Look, let's be sensible about this thing.
There's money in this for all of us.
There's enough for you.
There's enough for you...
...for me...
...and for you...
...and there's enough for--
Melville, my shoe!
Get in the car!
2-1-5-8, 2-1-6-2, four cars under observation are passing this checkpoint.
Lead car is Plymouth station wagon.
Next, the Ford van, the Volkswagen...
...and the Chrysler Imperial convertible,
all doing about 50.
Yep, they're on their way.
-All traveling in the same direction?
-Right. According to my boys...
...they're all on reckless driving charges already.
None of those people must suspect that anybody's interested in them.
Now, Sheriff,
will you get on to Capt. Hardesty...
...and see how many helicopters
he can let us have?
I'll see what we can do and I'll call you back.
Now, where have I always told you that the Smiler hid the dough?
-I know.
-Where?
-Right there.
-That's right, yeah.
If these merrymakers decide to go for it...
...they'll go to the crossroads and turn south.
But why did Smiler head east when he made his break...
...if the money is down here somewhere?
Aloysius, the guy is just being clever.
You can't--
5 will get you 10...
-...they turn south at the crossroads.
-You got yourself a bet.
"Mount Shasta National Forest."
Are we near--
That's on the top!
Look down near the bottom.
-Are we near Oregon?
-That's 700 miles from here.
Don't pass it!
You'll lose your license.
We've got the lmperial and we're running last?
I can't pass them on the curves.
Go on. Go ahead. Look, there's a space!
You waiting for an engraved invitation?
Get over!
Get over to the side where you belong!
I said it before and I'll say it again.
I didn't want to move to California.
-Did you find it yet?
-I can't find it anywhere.
Take the wheel. Give me the map.
Take the wheel! Give me the map.
It must be here.
Right over here. Valley Center!
It's right here.
There's an airfield not far--
Get it off your face!
-Get it off me!
-Don't go in there!
Swing over! Watch out!
-Take it off.
-Get it off!
I've had enough.
-They're going to hire airplanes.
-Never mind. Go!
-But they'll be there hours before--
-I said never mind. Let's go!
Nobody's getting me up in the air.
I wanted to be reasonable, give them reasonable shares.
No. They wanted every man for himself.
I'm going to show them what kind of man they're dealing with.
It's stalled, Benjy.
We got dust in the carburetor.
When the people who own this see this,
I sure hate to think--
Never mind.
Here's the bike. Get to the nearest phone and hire the best car you can find.
But this is a girl's bike.
This is for a little girl.
I've got to get this stuff back so I can lock up the van.
We'll put everything away.
Will you get going? Hurry.
Okay.
I got to admit...
...I feel kind of silly.
You know what I mean?
Will you take us or won't you?
For $250, I guess I will.
You take care of the plane.
We'll leave our car here till tomorrow.
-I'll give you a check.
-Check?
Traveler's check from the Bank of America.
Don't worry.
Are you a pilot? Is there a plane around?
Right both times.
Where's an airplane? I don't see any.
There's only one. We've chartered it.
-So you and your friend--
-Did you make a deal with them?
-Right.
-Where can we charter another plane?
-Nearest place is North Valley.
-Where's that?
Other side of Valley Center, about 12 miles, 15 miles.
-Excuse us.
-Filibuster, filibuster.
You can stick around and watch us take off.
Listen, dentist. I hate dentists.
I hate you so much, I'm not able to tell you how much in front of your wife.
Vice versa.
Come on over here! Come on!
Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Had an accident?
-Anyone hurt?
-No, but we've got to get to a phone.
Can you give us a lift?
Of course, I should be absolutely delighted.
Upsy-daisy.
I'm afraid you caught me on the hub there.
Madam, do be careful.
I have some cactus specimens--
I'm most frightfully sorry.
I've been gathering some samples of desert flora.
Where shall I put this?
Boy.
Good morning.
It certainly is. We're in a hurry.
We've got to get to a phone.
Of course, with pleasure.
Jolly nasty accident there.
Jolly lucky nobody was hurt.
Where did you get that funny accent?
Are you from Harvard or something?
Harvard? Rather not. I'm English.
Sounds so foreign.
Really? I say, we haven't introduced ourselves.
My name is Algernon Hawthorne--
Col. Hawthorne.
-You're a colonel?
-Lieutenant colonel, actually.
My name is Finch. This is my wife.
This is my mother-in-law, Mrs. Marcus.
Do stuff those in the back.
Cactus. It's rather a hobby of mine.
Spent the last 10 days gathering some for my collection.
Nothing spectacular, actually.
Cereus echinocactus, opuntia.
That sort of thing.
Been enjoying a spot of leave from Vandenberg.
-From what?
-Vandenberg.
The missile place.
I've been attached there for the last 10 months. Liaison work.
All very hush-hush and whoosh-whoosh.
That sort of thing, you know.
Please, will you look at the road?
Yes.
-Don't stop! Keep moving!
-Mother!
That big stupid lout! He ran into us.
Keep moving!
I won't fly in this old...Listen to it.
Look at how it's shuddering.
Can't we go on our second honeymoon and forget all about this?
Honey, please, darling.
Believe me, everything is all right.
Do you think I'd take a chance with you if there was any danger in flying this thing?
This plane is really built.
When was this plane built?
1916. These planes are tried and true.
There's nothing experimental about these planes.
So, come on.
Let's have one big adventure.
Get up there and have some fun.
Here we go.
-That scratched the paint.
-Help!
Haven't you got another car--
What? All right. Thanks.
Are you sure you can't rent us that truck?
I'll pay.
I told you, we can't.
This is our first week open.
How could we do without our truck?
We're in business.
We'll have to speak to the Englishman.
If we tell him what happened--
How can you admit we're involved--
-He'll say he's entitled to a share.
-He would be if he drove us there.
If we don't tell him, he won't.
You're such a genius.
Listen! Only 10 percent!
There's no reason he should expect any more!
Thanks for stopping.
Can you give me a lift?
What's with the kiddy bicycle?
Are you some kind of a nut?
No. I had an accident.
I got to get to Santa Rosita fast.
Can't help you.
I'm turning off a little way up.
Wait, let me think.
I got to tell somebody.
Could you spare a couple of hours?
Couple of hours?
You've been out in the sun too long.
You're starting to crack up.
Wait a minute. Listen.
Just hear me out.
What I'm going to tell you, you just ain't going to believe it could've happened.
There was an accident here a little while back...
...about 20 miles back.
It involved $350,000.
Now, like I say...
...when I tell you this, you just ain't going to believe it could've happened.
Try me. I'm pretty gullible.
What bothers me is this big W.
You sure you told me all you know?
You don't know what that guy meant?
No, none of them know.
It's just who gets there first.
What do you say? Is it a deal?
Deal!
Kid, you better get that bike out of there.
Somebody could trip over it in the dark.
Fellas, I'm glad you're here.
Look, I need your help.
I had this blowout.
I think a spare's in the back.
It may be a little flat.
Is there an airport anyplace around?
If the spare's flat, don't fix it.
Give me a new tire.
You ain't got a new tire, fix the spare.
But don't look at me, move it.
You could be gassing up.
What is it, a staring contest?
Move, move, will you? Come on!
The pension in my grade...
...has not been upped one red cent since 1934.
If the Mayor will get behind a resolution--
What can I do?
I can't put any pressure on the Mayor!
You can, Al.
That's the whole point.
This case, I'll have finished by tonight.
It's one of the biggest cases we've ever had across our books.
Tell the Mayor about it.
Tell him the money is right here, where I always said it was...
...right in this neighborhood.
Tell him what credit will be reflected upon the department.
Come on, Aloysius, get in there and pitch for me.
I can try.
He'll listen to you.
If he gets behind this, it'll pass unanimously.
Now, you know....
You know, Al, I got it coming.
I'll do everything I can.
-You know that, don't you?
-Yes.
There's just one other little thing....
No. Nothing.
Vacation.
Once I get Smiler Grogan out of the way, my desk is clear.
I'd like to take a three-week vacation.
Take Ginger on a real nice holiday.
-Is that all right with you?
-Of course it's all right.
Thanks. I can hardly wait to tell her.
-You won't forget about the Mayor?
-No.
I'll do my best. I promise you that.
Aloysius, I'll never forget you for this.
You know something, Al?
I got a feeling this morning...
...that everything's coming my way.
Sylvester!
-Why did you do that?
-Why are you shouting?
-Do you have to scare everybody?
-Are you crazy?
Why didn't I think?
We've been running around like lunatics.
Why didn't I think about Sylvester?
He's sitting there right now.
-He lives on Silver Strand Beach.
-I never thought of that.
-Who on earth is Sylvester?
-My son, Emmeline's brother.
He's a lifeguard there.
I'm not entirely certain that you haven't damaged this machine.
Kid, don't mind polishing.
I got a lot of cars. Don't bother.
You did a good job.
Have a drink on me. Keep the change.
I took care of your buddy. Let me go now.
You!
No! It's that lunatic who escaped from the asylum!
Watch him! He's a homicidal maniac!
Get on the phone, yell "Mayday."
Listen to me. I'm a psychiatrist.
This man is insane! I'm not your nurse.
He has a hate complex.
Calm down!
Somebody will stumble over the bicycle in the dark, huh?
When I finish with you, they'll be stumbling over you in the dark!
Get on the phone!
Look out!
Look, I was clowning.
Get out of here! Sir, wait a minute.
You've got this all...Why don't you stop?
I tell you. I'll kill you!
You got this...Wait!
Don't take it so....
Will you stop staring and get out of....
He's out of his head.
-He's crazy!
-Want us to call...Ray!
It's a brand-new pump!
-Get out of here!
-Stop that!
Stop that! He's crazy!
Very good. Quick thinking.
I'm proud of you.
Very good. Tie him up.
I'll have some orderlies come by with a straitjacket.
-Very good. I'm proud of you.
-I never saw anything....
-How many people has he killed?
-There'll be more.
Tie him up for the boys in the white jackets.
I'm proud of you, boys.
You did a real good job.
Look me up. I'm in the book. Dr. Zillman.
-Sir, we've got to get to Santa Rosita.
-I tell you, this is a club.
We don't do charters.
Nobody here can take you.
-Whose plane is that?
-That belongs to Mr. Tyler Fitzgerald.
He isn't going anywhere today.
-Is he here? Can we see him?
-Mr. Fitzgerald's in the billiard room.
-He's asleep. Nobody can talk to him.
-Can we ask him a question?
No, you can't.
Hello? Wait a minute!
Come on, Benjy.
That must be Mr. Fitzgerald over there!
-You can't disturb Mr. Fitzgerald!
-We just want to talk to him.
-Let him rest, please.
-Hello.
Don't shush me!
We're trying to talk to him.
Wake up, won't you please?
I think he's got a cold.
Mr. Fitzgerald, listen. Please, sir.
We hate to disturb your sleep, but it's an emergency.
You've no right to crash in here.
That's a head cold.
Mr. Fitzgerald, you know where Rosita Beach is?
-Only you can get us there.
-It's a matter of life and death.
Right, a matter of life and death.
-It's our grandmother. She's dying.
-Who's dying?
Our grandmother is dying and she's sent for us.
She's in Rosita Beach.
She's dying and we're up here.
She'd like us with her when she goes.
Otherwise, she won't go.
-She'll go.
-Sir, they forced their way in here.
No, we didn't. Let me introduce myself.
I'm Dingy Bell. This is Benjy Benjamin.
-How do you do?
-Don't start with that!
Sir, we'd like you to help us out by taking us down--
-What's the matter?
-Wait just a minute.
I can't see!
Something's happened to my eyes.
I can't see!
You can't see? He can't see.
-Must be an eye cold.
-George, I can't see.
-One minute, Mr. Fitzgerald.
-I can't see! George!
George!
Mr. Fitzgerald!
We want to make sure he doesn't get loose.
I'll kill that dirty rotten bum...
...if I get my hands on him.
What's the matter?
How come I'm tied up like this?
Just sit there. Everything will be all right.
Yeah. Friends are coming to take care of you.
What friends? What are you talking about?
Get this stuff off me. Turn me loose.
Take it easy. You've been sick.
Who's been sick?
And where's that bum with the glasses?
Now just sit still, because the doctor is going--
What doctor? I don't know no doctor.
What are you guys, crazy or something?
I'm warning you.
Get this stuff off me, you understand?
-Get this stuff off me!
-Watch him, Ray, watch him!
I'm warning you!
I'm going to have to hit you again.
My arm! You broke my arm!
You keep this up and I'm going to get sore.
Okay. That's the way you want it, that's the way you're going to get it.
I'll kill you!
-Help! He's ruining our place!
-Come on, Ray!
-You better get out of here, mister!
-Leave us alone!
-There you are.
-What are we going to do?
Dr. Zillman!
Help! Put me down!
Put me down immediately!
-That's the way you want it?
-Help!
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.
You're getting out of line.
I'm not kidding. I've had all I can take.
Irwin, we'll have to kill him.
-Ready?
-Ready.
-Set?
-Set.
Charge!
He's going nuts! He's really nuts!
-Go away!
-You'd better get out of here!
I mean it, I don't want to....
What'll we do?
Go away!
Go, baby, go!
He's got to be home.
He never gets up this early.
Why doesn't he answer?
I hope you won't mind my asking, but what sort of chap...
...is this brother-in-law of yours?
He's a nut. Why?
I hope he's nothing like my brother-in-law.
Peculiar chap.
Secretary of a golf club out near Pangbourne.
So what about him?
I was thinking that if Reggie, my brother-in-law....
If Reggie got hold of information like this information...
...it's likely that would be the last time...
...anyone would ever see or hear of dear old Reggie.
I doubt very much whether old Reggie will be waiting for us in Santa Rosita.
Cheers.
Tyler! Tyler's probably still in the shower.
Tyler! There he is! Tyler!
-Tyler!
-You promised!
I'll wake him up.
Wake up! Come on now!
-Get out of here!
-Wait!
Mr. Fitzgerald!
You think I'll sit still while some un-American foreigner...
...makes accusations about my own flesh and blood?
We'll see about that. Stop this car!
-Really, madam.
-Mother, this is awful!
-So we'll see!
-Mother, what are you doing?
You don't trust your brother-in-law?
Let me tell you something.
If my boy is out, then everybody is out.
So we'll see.
We don't even own the car and you have no right to do what you do.
Rights? You talk to me about rights?
You address me on the subject of rights?
Trouble? Having any trouble?
Yes! And we don't need any help from you.
Well!
Mother, please.
With all due respect, this is too much.
Give Mr. Hawthorne the keys or we'll never get there.
Too bad.
Madam, I must say I find your attitude somewhat less than helpful.
And what's all this got to do with you, if you don't mind telling me?
If we have quite decided to withdraw from this affair...
...you might be expected to hand me back my keys so that I could press on.
You keep out of this!
Are we calling Sylvester or not?
No!
We are not. And I'll tell you why.
Because your son, Sylvester...
...is an irresponsible, unreliable, big loudmouth, no-good bum...
...who, if he isn't a crook, it's only because...
...he hasn't got the brains or ambition even to become a crook.
Good show!
If you want to come, you can.
If you don't want to, you don't have to.
But you've got to give us those keys or you'll force us to take them from you!
Here, here.
Give us those keys.
I don't care where you have them.
I'll get them.
-How dare you.
-Give us those keys.
-You just take one more step towards me--
-I'll take another step.
I'm warning you. You're gonna be sorry!
-Give me the keys.
-You're gonna get it, but good!
-Emmeline!
-Emmeline, stay in the car!
Grab her!
Russell, don't! Mother!
-Put me down!
-Must be stuck.
Russell, you wouldn't.
You couldn't! You shouldn't!
Let me go! Let me get out of here!
I got 'em! Here they are.
We really didn't want to do it.
But that was the only way. Upsy-daisy.
Don't hurt him.
Madam, please! Please!
You forced us.
I'm willing to say I'm sorry, but you forced us.
-Do us a favor and get back in the car.
-Get away from me! Don't you touch me!
-We had to do it. You saw it, honey.
-Russell, let me go.
Just wait.
You can't manhandle a decent woman.
You're going to jail!
You'll be arrested for assault.
I'm going to sue for everything you've got.
Take your hands off my daughter!
I say, if we are going, we really must get cracking.
Russell, how could you?
-You know we had to--
-Mr. Finch!
Please don't go. We'll be right with you.
See, she made us do it.
Let's forget the whole thing and be reasonable.
-Please get back in the car.
-Not me!
We are wasting so much time.
Give me the keys.
The cars are going faster than we are.
Can't you make this thing go a little faster?
Wide open, I can.
But wide open eats up a lot of gas.
Then open up wide. I'll pay for the gas.
-It'll cost you about $50.
-Okay, I'll pay when we land.
-Now!
-I got to pay now?
-Now!
-All right, I'll pay you now.
-Melville....
-What?
A bug! Get him off!
Get him off! There he is! Get him!
-You're breaking up the airplane!
-Is it down there?
Now you're breaking the floor!
Help!
None of these 10 people have any record at all.
And we're ready to book 'em for withholding information...
...causing accidents, failing to report accidents...
...reckless driving, theft, at least three cases of assault and battery--
-Capt. Culpeper?
-Yeah.
-That my home?
-Yes, sir.
Sheriff, excuse me. Another call.
Take the Sheriff. I'll take it in here.
Freddy, transfer Mrs. Culpeper to Culpeper's office.
-Hello, Ginger?
-Daddy, it's Billie Sue.
Let me speak with your mother, sweetheart.
Well?
Dear.
Tell me something, Ginger.
How does it feel being married...
...to the most brilliant personality in the law enforcement industry?
Are you referring to yourself?
Ginger, I want you to prepare yourself for a little shock.
-When I tell you what has happened--
-So tell me. I've got this biscuit dough--
The Smiler Grogan case is solved.
The what?
What the hell is the Smiler Grogan case?
The tuna factory robbery.
The case I've been talking about for the last 15 years.
All I want you to do is make all the preparations...
...for a little flight to Hawaii,
Sunday morning.
-So what's the gag?
-It is no gag.
Are you serious about flying to Hawaii?
Flight 7, Sunday morning.
-Are we taking Billie Sue?
-No!
Just the two of us for about three weeks.
Now, we're going to celebrate, Ginger.
My feeling is that after 27 years...
...we've earned it.
What's the matter?
-I need help. Can you give me a lift?
-What?
My wife is sick.
The doc sent me out for some medicine.
All right. Come on.
-I just ran out of gas.
-Get in!
-You?
-You?
Wait a minute. We're in trouble.
Everybody's in trouble.
Get out of the way.
You think we wanted to leave you back there?
-It was my son-in-law and that Englishman.
-What Englishman? Get out of the way.
You leave us here, and you know what you're going to get?
Nothing! We'll get it all.
How will you do that?
I'll call my son. He lives about 10 miles from Rosita Beach.
He'll drive there and get the money and we're going to have it. That's how!
I was going to offer you a share for taking us to a phone.
But because you're not interested, we'll wait for another car.
We're making a terrible mistake.
We should go back and get my mother-in-law.
-Go back?
-Yes.
You couldn't be serious.
All she has to do is get to a telephone, my brother-in-law will get there first.
They'll get all and we won't get a dime.
You can believe that.
But look here.
Even if she does get all the money, this won't make any difference...
...to our agreement.
She wouldn't break her word.
I mean to say, I'd still be entitled to 10 percent as agreed. Surely.
Surely. Come on, let's go.
-Operator.
-Santa Rosita 7-1-9-6-5.
...and then that dirty, rotten, slimy bum that double-crossed me.
When I get a hold of that smart aleck, what I'm going to do....
If you're there, I hope you turn away...
...that's all, that you just look the other way.
Did you get him?
Maybe he went out for the papers or something.
We can keep on trying.
Just supposing we never do get him?
We might be the last ones there.
Just a minute. Down there?
You're kidding. It's too steep.
I drive my jeep down here every day.
Let's go!
Yeah, let's go. Let's....
You can turn around here.
I sure appreciate this, mister. Thanks.
Yeah, swell, yeah.
Hi, Eddie.
I got to get out of here.
Will you ask your father to show me?
There must be some other way out!
Come on! Hurry up!
I could show you a way out.
There's another way to the road.
You know another way to the road?
Good. Come on in. Don't stand there.
If you show me the way out,
I'll give you $1.
-$3? Why, you....
Yeah, all right. I'll give you $3.
But don't stand there, hop in the car.
Hurry kid, I got to get out of here!
-They're not here.
-Probably got a lift.
We only passed six or seven cars and they weren't in them.
Somebody must have taken them the other way.
I think we better go back to that place we phoned from.
What? That's miles in the wrong direction.
Besides, we can't be certain they'll be there.
I don't know, I must find my wife.
And I don't know what to do.
Wherever they are...
...surely the most sensible thing is for the two of us to press on.
For all we know, your brother-in-law may be out or away somewhere.
Even if he were the first there, he still has to find the money.
I earnestly recommend we forget your good ladies...
...and press on with all possible dispatch.
All right.
We'll press on with all possible dispatch.
And I don't really think that personal rancor...
...is going to help the situation, if I may say so.
Okay, come on, honey.
Let's go. We're here.
We got here first. Let's go.
Come on. I got you.
Atta boy, baby.
We made it. We're here first.
Take care of my car until we get back, right?
Come on, let's go. Will you go? Come on!
Over there?
There?
Down there?
That'll be $2.90.
$2.90? Here's $3.00.
Keep the change, but wait for us, okay?
Sure.
Wise guy. Come on, let's go.
-No, we're closed. It's 12:00.
-It's 12:00. They're closed.
Wait a minute!
All we want is a pick and a shovel!
Mr. Dinkler's inside.
Dinkler. That's it.
We'll get Dinkler. Come on.
Downstairs. Come on.
They must be here someplace.
Down here, yeah.
Look for a pick and a shovel, all right?
Pick and a shovel, must be someplace around.
That's all I need.
That's all I need, boy.
That's all I need, a pick and a shovel.
I found it!
Got it!
-But there--
-I got it! I found it!
I've no wish to quarrel with you, but speaking as a representative...
...of Her Majesty's Armed Forces,
I take the most particular exception--
You want me to tell you something?
As far as I'm concerned...
...the whole British race is practically finished.
If we hadn't kept your whole country afloat...
...by giving you billions you never even said thank you for...
...the whole phony outfit would be sunk under the Atlantic years ago.
-What are you stopping for?
-Get out of this machine.
Get out? You're crazy!
It's my machine.
I'll do as I bloody well please. Out!
I'm awfully sorry.
I've been very edgy today.
If I said anything about England,
I apologize.
I'm glad to hear you say so.
I must say, if I had the misfortune to be a citizen of this benighted country...
...I should be most hesitant in offering any criticism of any other.
Wait a minute.
Are you knocking this country?
Are you saying something against America?
Against it?
I'd be astounded to hear anything said for it.
The whole bloody place is the most unspeakable matriarchy...
...in the history of civilization.
Look at yourself, the way your wife and her strumpet of a mother...
...push you through the hoop.
As far as I can see, American men have been totally emasculated.
They're like slaves.
They die like flies from coronary thrombosis...
...while their women sit under hair dryers eating chocolates...
...and arranging for every second Tuesday to be some sort of Mother's Day.
And this positively infantile preoccupation with bosoms....
In all my time in this wretched country...
...the one thing that has appalled me most is this preoccupation with bosoms.
They've become the dominant theme in American culture:
In literature, in advertising, in entertainment, in everything.
I'll wager you anything you like...
...if American women stopped wearing brassieres...
...your whole national economy would collapse overnight.
F-7 to Central. The Crumps are locked...
...in the hardware store basement.
Shall I let them out? Over.
How could they get locked in a basement?
-We better let them out.
-That ain't fair.
-It ain't fair? What ain't fair?
-They got themselves in there.
They ought to be able to get themselves out.
After all, if you help them, you're not being fair to the others.
But the moment anybody gets to where they're going...
...we'll pick them up.
What difference does it make who gets there first?
It's a race, ain't it?
Why do you want to help that dentist?
Me? I've been pulling for that guy Pike with the furniture van.
The rules should be the same for everybody.
Otherwise, it just ain't fair.
Central to F-7.
No. We'll leave them where they are.
See what happens.
Watch all the exits, but render no assistance. Over.
Are you happy?
I need a drink.
There's some ice and stuff back there.
Make us all some Old Fashioneds.
You think you ought to drink while you're flying?
Stop kidding and make us some drinks.
Just press the button back there marked "booze."
It's the only way to fly.
Estimated speed 175.
We'll never be able to keep up with him.
Better have some of the other units intercept. Over.
Hello, Ginger? What's the matter now?
It's Billie Sue. Her new boyfriend Oscar...
...was supposed to come down
from Pomona just to meet us.
-So now she told him we were going away.
-What? What's the matter?
You keep forgetting.
If a girl is 6 feet 5 inches tall...
...she's bound to have special problems.
-But, Ginger--
-They had some argument...
Get out!
...screaming at each other.
Now the whole engagement's off...
...and she says she's leaving.
Leaving what? Leaving home?
-Let me talk to her. Get her to the phone.
-I'll try. Just a minute.
-Talk to your father.
-I won't. I don't want to talk to him ever.
Don't be ridiculous.
Whatever else he is, he is your father.
You hear bells, baby?
Yes?
-Who is that?
-Who's that?
I want my son!
Who is that?
I want to speak to Sylvester Marcus.
-Sylvester?
-Yeah, baby?
It's your mom.
Good old Mom. Hello!
-Sylvester?
-Is that you, Mom?
Of course it's me.
I've been trying you all morning.
I've been a little busy.
I've been working and I didn't hear the phone.
Hold on a minute, will you, Mom?
Baby, how about a beer or something?
Man, I feel like--
Will you listen? Something's happened.
There was an accident this morning.
A man got killedl
Who got killed?
-Now, listenl
-You all right?
-Pay attentionl
-Sis all right?
-Will you listen?
-What's wrong?
Can you hear me?
There's a whole fortune in cash.
You can get it before anybody else, but you've got to hurry!
What's the matter?
What's going on there? Are you all right?
Of course I'm all right.
Are Russell and Emmeline with you?
Forget about Russell.
Will you shut up and let me talk?
What's going on? Where's Russell?
Don't even mention Russell!
-When I tell you what Russell did--
-Just tell him about the dough.
Keep out of this! Shut up!
-Don't talk. Just listen.
-What did Russell do?
He assaulted me, if you wanna know!
He grabbed me beside the road.
He and this Englishman I don't even know!
Who's with you and where are you?
I'm with this truck driver in Peterson's Garage in Plaster City.
Will you shut up a minute so I can tell you what happened?
Listen to me close! Stay there,
'cause I'm coming to get you right now.
Shut up and listen!
Everything's going to be all right.
Your baby's coming to get you.
Sit there. Relax. Take it easy.
I'm coming.
Everything's going to be all right.
Well?
So he's coming here, and I'm not to worry about a thing.
Because everything is going to be all right.
Exactly like your father: a big, stupid, muscle-headed moron!
The burglar alarm.
We just throw it on, people hear it, they come, and we're out.
Don't be frightened if it makes a big bell noise.
Okay? All right? Here we go.
-I don't hear anything.
-Neither do I. There's no bell.
Look at it. It just stands there.
Wait a minute.
Stand back.
Burglar alarm!
The stupidest burglar in the world could come in...
...and walk away with everything, and we can't even get out.
Come here!
Even if you do get the bell to ring and somebody comes...
...what about the damage?
They're the ones who locked us in!
This thing has got to work.
No!
Please, help me! I'm frying!
Please! Help me!
Don't make them so sweet this time.
You've had two already.
Can't you wait till we're on the ground?
What are you talking about?
I'll make the next batch.
You take the controls.
-I don't know how to fly an airplane.
-There's really nothing to it.
-But Benjy can't fly!
-That's nonsense. Anybody can fly a plane.
I'll check you out.
Put your little hands on the wheel.
That's it. Now you have it.
Now the feet on the rudder.
There you are, feet on the rudder.
Who says this boy can't fly a plane?
There you go.
I'm making an Old Fashioned the old-fashioned way...
...the way dear old Dad used to.
What if something happens?
What can happen to an Old Fashioned, all right?
I know you don't know what to do, so don't do nothing.
-I won't do nothing.
-That boy's a natural-born flyer.
Wait a minute. Ease back on her!
-I'm easing.
-Ease back a little!
-I'm trying my best.
-All kidding aside--
I'm not kidding any longer.
It's making me...
...nervous!
We've got an accident back here!
-What happened?
-I don't know!
It's good that truck pulled over.
I can't stand this anymore.
In the name of reason, pull yourself together.
You were 10 feet over the line.
So it's fisticuffs you want, is it?
Right. Stick them up!
-No! No!
-Come here, you coward!
No! Don't hit me!
-Stop, you!
-Don't hit me!
-Blood.
-It certainly is.
Come back here, you blimey....
You want to play it dirty? Okay!
Foul!
You're not much good...
...without that horrible mother-in-law of yours, are you?
Come on. Fight!
You thought you had me, didn't you?
I'll kill you. I swear!
No, stop, please! No, please.
-Hello. Hello there.
-Don't shut the motor off!
I'm not shutting anything off!
Hello, anybody! Can anybody hear me?
-I can hear you!
-I don't care if you hear me!
-I don't know whether we're on the air.
-Mayday. Call mayday!
Mayday! Mayday, we're up here!
Can you hear us? Help!
-Benjy, say something.
-Help!
Hello? Billie Sue?
-Billie Sue, where are you?
-I'm at the bus station.
I only called because
Mommy said I absolutely--
Sweetie, what are you doing in the bus station?
I'm waiting for the bus.
Your wife's on the other phone.
Ginger?
I've got Billie Sue on the other line.
Billie Sue, wait one minute, will you?
-Ginger?
-I'm here.
Can you hear Billie Sue? She's crying.
She's in the bus station and she's crying, but she's waiting for you to tell her.
-Billie Suel
-Are you listening?
-Are you listening to your mother?
-Your mother is speaking.
-Listen to your mother, sweetie.
-Billie Suel
Billie Sue! Listen to your mother!
Everything that's happened to my daughter and me today...
...only happened for one reason: because you were too stupid...
...to look where you were going, and wrecked our car!
Yeah?
You either get out of that truck or I'm going to throw you out.
Don't get upset.
You're not going to do anything.
Drive on, you big, stupid idiot.
Mommy, don't worry.
Your baby's coming to save you!
Mr. Pike, please!
-Let me go! Get away from me!
-That isn't nice a bit!
Mother!
That's what I'm here for.
That's why you had me, to save you.
Help me!
Emmeline!
Yeah, yeah.
It's practically burned through.
Just a couple blows with the sledgehammer and we're out.
Wait a minute!
I can't cross here!
You said the main road.
This is Niagara Falls.
All right, look. You're a little boy.
If you want to be a big boy, which way to the main road?
Don't!
Don't!
It's no! The answer is no.
He won't back any increase in pensions.
He won't even talk about it.
There won't be any increase in pensions.
Do you know why?
Because they got a solid majority...
...of Republicans and Democrats who've agreed...
...that if anything is said about pensions, they'll actually reduce your pension!
Why? Because they know that you personally...
...were more responsible than anybody else for closing down the houses.
Could I do anything?
Would he listen to me?
All right. So you're an honest cop...
...and you've spent a lifetime being an honest cop...
...and you've got that, and that's all you've got!
It's no good saying I'm sorry.
I'm too angry and sick at my stomach to be sorry.
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
That's the trouble with this family.
Melville, I smell something burning.
We're on fire! Come over here.
Come on. This way. Go down. Now. Go.
Hurry up!
Put it out!
I don't know how! Get something!
-The extinguishers.
-Get one!
-What'll I do?
-Use it!
Not on me! On the fire!
It's too deep!
This is a car, not a canoe!
Come on! It's easy!
If I don't get out of here...Why? Why?
All right! Here I come!
It's too deep!
It's too deep, you little rat fink!
Why didn't you tell me it was...
What do I....
Don't stand there!
Get somebody! Don't....
This is no place for a convertible!
I'll get you.
I'm bleeding, Emmeline!
Look! I'm bleeding!
Mama! What did they do to my Mama?
Benjy!
It's your father's fault.
-The whole thing is your father's fault.
-Mommy.
It's your father's fault.
What's the matter, Chief?
Something wrong?
-You know as well as I do--
-Listen to me and stop yellingl
Stop it, Billie.
Billie, you're not listening.
Now stop it. Stop it, Monica!
It's only two pieces of small dynamite.
And they're 70 feet away in the other room.
This is a strong counter.
We can't possibly get hurt from there.
Please, go and stop it.
Stamp on it or something.
-You know I hate explosions.
-It's perfectly all right.
I just want to blow a small hole in the wall, then we'll be out of here.
Something's happened to the fuse.
-What could possibly--
-Hold it.
Listen.
The fuse has gone out.
I can't hear it anymore.
-Stay down. Don't get up.
-I just want to take a look, okay?
Now I see.
It's the fire extinguisher stuff.
The fire extinguisher stuff got on the fuse and put it out.
Melville, don't go in there. You'll be killed.
-You'll be blown to bits.
-Monica, for heaven's sake.
I just want to take a look!
Why do you always imagine
I can't do things for myself?
Don't you think I got any sense at all?
Why can't you have a little confidence in me?
-I'll never be bad again!
-Whoever said you could fly?
What do ya want from me?
How long I been flying?
-Keep it going!
-Can't you talk to that radio?
Hello, anybody on the ground!
On the ground, anybody!
Can you hear us?
-Stand back!
-Everybody, stand back.
Stand back, folks. Folks, stand back.
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.
Do you hear me?
-We don't know who they are.
-This is Rancho Conejo Tower.
Aircraft calling Rancho Conejo Tower,
this is Rancho Conejo Tower.
I got 'em!
I got 'em!
Hello, down there on the ground.
This is us in the air. We're in trouble!
An awful jam. Listen. Hello?
I think I lost them.
Wait a minute.
You're not using the set the right way.
You press your switch in to transmit.
When it's released, you're on receive.
Can you understand me?
This is Rancho Conejo Tower.
-Where are you and who are you? Over.
-I know how to work it, Benjy!
I know how to work it.
Hello, down on the ground.
This is us in the air.
We're in this fella's plane.
He knocked himself out...
...because he drank a whole case of bourbon and hit his head.
What do we do?
The switch, let go of the switch!
If you can, give us your position.
Who's flying the plane? Over.
Whaddya mean, "Who's flying the plane?"
Nobody's flying the plane!
Sir? Tower here. Emergency.
Tell him it's a full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.
Full emergency.
We'll try and talk 'em down.
It's a Twin Beech.
I saw one here this morning.
Who's got a Twin Beech?
It's that Col. Wilberforce.
He was at maintenance.
If he's still there, get him over here.
Now listen. Don't talk, just listen.
We're getting things under control, so you can take it easy.
We know what kind of a plane you're in.
We're making necessary preparations to talk you down.
Rancho Conejo over.
Rancho Conejo tower, listen,
we can't land this thingl
We're in real trouble. Overl
You'll be perfectly all right as long as you follow instructions.
The man at the controls should also be the man on the radio.
-Here. Put 'em on.
-No. I don't want to!
Put 'em on!
He said the fella flying should be on this thing.
Am I supposed to do everything?
You want me to fly, work the radio?
What are you? The hostess?
No, he's got to take charge.
What's the matter with him?
He's just sitting there, rigid-like.
If he catches you at that keyhole, you'll be rigid-like.
-He didn't want to be disturbed.
-He keeps looking at the wall.
He'll have to be disturbed if any of this develops further.
I bet you any amount of money that we could get on the ball and get....
Everything's under control, Chief.
-You okay, Chief?
-Yes. Why?
-How's it going?
-Something's bound to happen soon.
Take a look at this.
Those two in the basement started a fire...
...then set off fireworks.
They still didn't get out.
Those two guys in the airplane
had an accident...
...knocked the pilot unconscious.
The control tower
is trying to talk them down.
The others....
Aerial report that the man,
Otto Meyer, had an accident.
He tried to cross a river and he lost his car.
Now he's on foot,
walking back to the main road.
This fella Pike, he's here...
...coming in on 94 with Mrs. Marcus
and her daughter, Mrs. Finch.
Mr. Finch and this Algernon,
whatever his name is. The limey.
They're about five or six miles behind...
...in an Avis Chevrolet they rented
in Canyon City.
And this Sylvester Marcus,
the one the old lady called...
...he's about here going
in the other direction.
They all ought to be meeting up in about five minutes.
You know what I believe I'd like?
A chocolate fudge sundae with whipped cream and a cherry on top.
Dingy, don't let this worry you.
We're gonna get killed.
Men, this is Col. Wilberforce speaking.
These gentlemen here have asked me
to take charge of this situation...
...so I immediately said
that I'd be glad to take charge of it.
-Before I say anything else....
-I don't think he's going to help us, Dingy.
Yes he is, Benjy. He'll help us.
Now, just have confidence in him.
He's a colonel. Listen to him.
Steady, men.
I'm told that neither of you has had flying experience.
Before I say anything else...
...I want to congratulate you on having done so well...
...so far.
Now, first of all, men,
I'll explain what we intend to do.
You can't land the airplane until you've made your approach.
And you can't make your approach until you've made a long slow turnaround...
...down to the south.
And we've got to be clear on a few things before you can start that long slow turn.
Now, the stick that you're holding, that is, I assume that....
Men, are you holding that stick?
Is somebody holding that stick? Over!
What stick? The wheel. I'm holding it.
-We're both holding it.
-Good.
For a second there, I was afraid...
Never mind that.
Now I'll explain the controls.
It's important that you understand that.
Because if you don't,
I'm afraid what might....
-You want a lift?
-Yes, thank you very much.
It's nice of you to stop.
-I'm going as far as Santa Rosita Park.
-That's out of my way.
-We're blocking traffic.
-We are?
Let's move it. Move it.
There we go. All right.
You hide behind the counter.
I'll light up a fuse.
Melville, will you just do one thing for me before you use the dynamite?
Try hitting the door just once more.
Honey, I broke my back on that door.
That's a hard door. I mean....
Okay.
Where's the sledgehammer?
This staircase isn't safe anymore.
The fire burned it all out.
Please?
All right.
You're going to....
Melville, for God....
Melville!
Monica...
...now let's forget about the door.
Look out!
-What?
-They've spotted us.
-Who have?
-Don't stop. Keep going.
-What is this?
-Helicopter. They've seen us.
What helicopter?
-That's a police helicopter.
-They always use them.
-Who?
-Who do you think?
I don't want to talk about this, but they got me hemmed in.
-Who?
-Will you shut up and listen?
I'm going to break a rule that says we must never reveal our true identity.
This is a matter of life or death, a desperate situation.
-What is?
-Will you shut up and listen?
Look, I haven't got much time, so if you love your country...
...if you're a patriot, you'll listen, and listen hard.
You gotta get to a phone and make a call.
-I don't got--
-You got to call Intelligence.
Central Intelligence Agency in Washington, D.C.
-What on earth--
-Now, listen!
You tell 'em you heard from X-27.
You got it? X-27.
X-27 told you to tell them they've made three attempts on my life today.
They tried to drown me.
Can you handle a gun? Now, look....
There's a cafe. Pull right in there.
You'll use that phone.
-I don't think l--
-Shut up! You're in no danger.
They've never seen ya. Now, pull in.
All right, good. Get to a phone.
Tell the operator "emergency priority," then ask for the CIA.
Jump out. Come on, come on.
You're in no danger. They don't know you.
You're all right.
I'll duck the car and come back.
For God's sake, don't stand in the street.
They'll see you. They'll spot you!
Move it. Go!
Sylvester! It's Sylvester!
Turn around, you idiot!
What do you want to stop him for?
He's going the wrong way.
It's my son. Do as you're told, stupid.
They're nuts.
Tell them the tow truck turned around and is following the Dodge.
2-1-7-1, 2-1-5-9.
This is stupid.
You call me a stupid idiot.
Let me tell you something.
You're a stupid idiot.
-He'll go all the way to Plaster City.
-So he goes to Plaster City.
I don't know about you, but I'm turning this thing around.
Now, you want to catch him, you get out and run.
Let's stop arguing. Please.
The reason we're together is because they only had one car.
Let's get there, even if we are last.
Whatever the outcome of the day,
I shall never forget that you hit me...
...when I wasn't even looking.
Yeah.
Russell!
-How can you be so slow?
-I've had just about enough out of you.
If ya turned quicker we coulda caught him!
-Why don't you shut up?
-Russell! There!
It's Russell and Mr. Hawthorne!
Stop them! Catch them!
We gonna start that again?
Faster! Step on it!
Blow the horn, you big dope!
What do you want them for anyway?
Keep up with them. You're falling behind.
Sylvester! Mother! Sylvester!
Stop him! Don't let him get away!
I say, what's that chap honking his hooter for?
It's probably some road hog who thinks he owns....
-What?
-What?
I got to ask you something about Mama!
Russell, wait a minute!
-It's my brother-in-law.
-What's he doing?
Be careful of him. He's not normal.
You're getting me--
Boy, are you bugging me, man!
I'm going to nail...l'm getting bugged now!
Whoa, man.
Russell, if you don't pull over, I'll kill you!
I'm warning you, pull over and stop.
I said stop!
You asked for it.
Russell, when I get my hands on you....
What are you doing?
-I said stop!
-Are you crazy?
-We'll get killed!
-Pull over!
Don't you know what I mean?
I said stop that car!
When I get my hands on you, Russell,
I will kill you!
Are you crazy?
I've never seen anything like this bunch.
He ran right into them, ran them right off the road.
-You guys, come on out of there!
-Fellow's absolutely beside himself.
-What are you trying to do?
-Let's go!
-What did you do to my mother?
-We wouldn't do any--
Move! Move!
-What did you do to my mother?
-I didn't do anything! Let me explain.
Look here.
She called me. She phoned me.
What she told me was so horrible,
I thought she'd gone nuts!
-It was true, wasn't it?
-It's not true.
Whoever told you was a liar. It's not true.
-It is true!
-Now, look here!
Are you English? Just answer me!
Yes. As a matter of fact, I am.
Don't you like the English?
There was an Englishman.
She said that you and this Englishman...
I'll kill you!
What did you do to my Mama?
-Emmeline!
-Mama!
Why couldn't you listen?
Why couldn't you shut up...
...when I was trying to tell you to listen?
That chap's run absolutely amok!
Few minutes, we'll have 'em in position.
In a couple of minutes, we'll have you in position.
-You're doing a great job, Colonel.
-Thank you.
Why not just shoot 'em down?
None of these people must suspect...
...that they have ever been under observation.
Now, none of them have ever seen me.
None of them know me...
...so I'll be moving in alone.
The minute I move in,
I'll give you the word.
And when you pass the word...
...I don't want to have another policeman within miles of me.
-Right?
-Right.
I won't like it if I see another policeman.
I give you my word.
I wanted to stop for you.
My wife and he wanted to stop for you.
Tell him how my mother-in-law made us drive by him.
Anything you have to say about your mother-in-law...
...you don't have to explain to me.
You know what I mean?
If she were a star of a real crummy horror movie...
...l'd believe it.
Yeah!
That's him!
If I catch you, I'll kill you!
I tell you, I'll kill you!
You dirty robber!
Someone you know?
I'll drive. All set?
All set, Chief.
Culpeper, all set?
Yes, sir. Airport just reported
and they're starting an approach now.
Right.
What's the matter, Chief?
You forgotten something?
No. I don't think I've forgotten a thing.
Now, men, about the brakes...
You've got to know about the brakes.
I'll tell you in just a minute.
Just hold it a second.
What the hell is with this wire?
Just hold it a second.
What was that?
Men, look.
Be calm. This is it.
Just one minute more, it'll be all over.
I mean, it'll all be over.
I mean, courage, men.
We're all with you every second.
We're pulling for you as hard as we can.
Now it's just hold onto your nerves, men,
and not get excited or do anything foolish.
But just keep calm. That's all we'll do.
Keep calm. Calm, menl
Not that calm, you idiot!
Pull up!
Now, don't worry. Just keep calm.
What's this? What's this that's coming?
-That's good. That's cement.
-What? Wait a minute! Hold it!
What are you doing, Benjy?
-What, are you trying to scare me?
-No!
Well, you did.
It's just a couple of sticks of dynamite, that's all.
How much noise could it make?
Boom. It's all over.
Get it over right! Get it over!
Left rudder!
Too low! Pull up.
No! Left rudder!
No! Pull it up!
Help!
Help! I'm the Colonel, you know!
Help!
Help! Get me down!
We're not going to land and we'll never make it.
What do you mean, we'll never make it?
Don't freeze.
Benjy, don't freeze.
This one's going to work.
-Damn it, come to!
-You hit me.
Listen, wait a minute.
We're down!
-We're on the ground.
-Hooray!
It's just a noise, that's all.
It's way over there.
Put on the brakes.
Okay. Where are they?
Benjy! Here comes a restaurant!
We've landed! Come on.
Come on. Hurry. Now, hurry up.
-Come on, let's go.
-What about him?
Never mind him. An ambulance will come.
Let's get out of here.
Cab!
Cab!
We're in an awful hurry.
Do you know where the State Park is?
Sure. What happened?
Emergency landing. Come on, hurry.
Quick, let's go. Come on.
Come on, Benjy.
Excuse me.
Excuse us. Here's your bag.
You see, the lock didn't work.
Go.
That's all.
The owners will pay for everything.
Next door, he'll pay for everything.
It's okay.
You people. You!
Come back here. Come back!
You vandals!
The cops in this town are morons, retarded.
I'm dealing with moronic people.
'Cause he's in a bad humor, that fat Nazi.
What, I gotta suffer 'cause of him?
Get away from me. What's the matter?
Can't you see I'm on the phone?
Gimme two minutes!
Now, listen, Sy....
Will you take us to Santa Rosita State Park?
What's the matter?
What happened to you? Initiation?
We had an accident. Hurry up!
Benjamin and Bell stopped at a gardener
supply place and bought picks and shovels.
Hold it, Chief.
Here's a report on the Crumps.
Their cab turned onto 101 moving south
toward your present position.
Wait.
The other taxi's also turning onto 101...
...and they're moving north.
They're both coming your way.
Understood.
Stand by.
They ought to be here any minute.
Look.
It's the two idiots, the little one and the one with the marbles in his mouth.
-It's that hokey dentist.
-Yeah.
Pass that cab.
-What's the rush?
-Whaddaya mean "rush"?
No rush. We're just in a hurry.
Culpeper.
Now.
Give the order to pull away.
-Come on. Hurry up.
-Shouldn't I wait around?
No. Here's $5.
-What's with the pick and shovel?
-Mind your own business. Come on.
-Think anybody is here?
-Didn't see any cars.
Wait a minute!
-Let's talk this over.
-I got nothing to talk about.
Wait a minute.
Think anybody else has been here?
-How should I know?
-Wait!
If you think we're the first ones here, why not make a deal?
The four of us?
Nobody knows where to look, so we'll look together.
We'll find it before the others.
Incidentally, where are all the others?
How come you two just got here?
You had the plane.
What happened to you?
They're up to something funny, you hear?
Did you see the blonde I brought, covered in paint with her dress ripped?
What's that all about?
Yeah. And what about the picks and shovels?
You run back to headquarters.
Wait till you hear from me.
-Let me come, Chief.
-I'd like to, but it might snarl things up.
Thanks for everything.
Lots of luck, Chief.
Benjy! Did you see anything, pal?
No, but there must be something somewhere.
-See anything?
-Not a thing.
Are you sure he didn't say something you've forgotten?
He said it's buried under a big W and that we'd see it.
-It's gotta be here.
-I tell you what we do.
You go how we came.
We'll go how you came.
We might have missed something. Hold it.
You go the way we came....
That's right. Okay, let's go.
They're looking for something buried under a big W.
I heard one of them, the stutterer, say it.
Yeah, I heard. But what?
Did you see anything?
-No. Did you?
-Nothing.
That guy hid it so good, he couldn't find it himself.
I think--
Who's he?
-I don't know.
-But he had a shovel.
Maybe he's a prospector.
-What are you talking--
-We're wasting time.
Harder. We gotta look harder!
Let's look harder. Come on, let's go.
-Who's he?
-I don't know, but he hasn't got a shovel.
-He's here, I tell ya.
-Yes, sir. That's his car.
-I'll get that phony.
-Somebody must've come in those cabs.
-Come on, let's get moving!
-Come on, let's get moving!
-They must be here.
-They'd better be. Come on, Emmeline.
-Don't just sit there!
-Don't just sit there!
Yes, I am.
Then sit!
Mrs. Finch, aren't you the teeniest bit curious?
No. I'm not even curious, just disgusted.
I say, that really is a pity.
Do forgive me, I must go.
You wouldn't know a big W if you saw one!
-I know a--
-Shut up!
I don't care what you say,
I don't think they're here yet.
They're here somewhere.
That means they haven't found it.
-That's all he said? "Under a big W"?
-Actually, I joined the party after that.
Yes, sir, that's what he said.
It's under a big W.
-Let's look--
-Will you shut up and follow me?
-Who's that?
-I don't know!
-From this morning?
-Yes.
-Who's he?
-I don't know.
-Who's he?
-I don't know!
Mama, how many people are mixed up in this?
Mama, who are they? Cabbies?
Mama, this thing's like a convention.
Is anything wrong, ma'am?
I didn't mean to startle you.
Who are you? Are you with the others, the ones that are looking?
-I am, in a way. Aren't you?
-No.
I mean, I didn't want anything to do with it right from the start.
And you know what?
I know where it is.
I'm the only one, and I wasn't even looking.
You know where it is?
Yes! What should I do?
Come on out, everyone! This is ridiculous.
-I absolutely agree.
-Come on out.
We all know we're all here.
Nobody's fooling anyone.
So we all know. So what?
Don't talk to my mama in that tone of voice!
-You hear?
-Shut up!
Listen, we ain't the only ones here.
I seen four or five others.
Those two cab drivers.
-They came with us and that dentist.
-You want to start?
-Yes, I want to--
-Why are we wasting time?
We're all here.
Even if somebody finds the money, nobody gets away with it...
...unless everybody gets a share.
Let's all get sensible and get this organized.
Did you all hear what Mama said?
-Come on, Mama.
-Now, wait a minute.
Did any of you see a guy with glasses...
...with a sneery expression on his face?
This guy was ugly. I mean, like, real ugly.
If you help dig it up, you can have half and I'll have half.
Is that okay? I mean, is that fair?
If I have half of the money...
...I can go away somewhere where nobody can find me.
Not Russell or my mother or Sylvester, anybody.
You don't know what that'd mean.
If I had enough money...
...I might be able to live in a convent or something.
In a convent?
We all know we're all here.
It seems intelligent to me that we should all share...
...in one equal share apiece, right?
Right. Mel was right.
We all know that. Lookit--
-No.
-Yeah.
It's him, all right. Yeah!
You got this wrong. I came to apologize.
Forgive and forget! I'm your friend.
-He's so neurotic. Can't you do something?
-I'll get you.
-He's very neurotic. I'm your friend!
-When I get my hands on you....
Why, that's it.
Sure. Look!
It's the big W, I tell you!
It's the big W!
Look at this.
Look at it!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Finch.
I'm afraid it's too late.
I think they've found it.
Right here all the time! He wasn't kidding!
-He was telling the truth!
-Folks, isn't this great?
Congratulations. Well done.
Listen, I think the big boy should get an extra share.
After all, it was he who found it.
Yes! I insist he gets an extra share.
That's right. He deserves an extra share.
Let's start digging.
Suppose somebody comes along.
What do we tell him?
We're here with an anthropological expedition.
-Nah.
-We don't tell them anything!
We tell them to scram or we beat their brains in.
It was a nice dream.
Lasted almost five minutes.
Now, don't bug me, I said.
Faster.
Come on, dig, dig.
Faster, faster.
Faster. Dig. That's it, dig.
Faster.
There's not enough room. You two, out.
Let us do it.
Wait. There's not enough room.
You're bugging me.
-"Bugging"?
-Cut out, cut out.
What's this "cut out" talk?
-Out, baby. Out!
-Don't call me baby.
-Quit arguing!
-Will ya come on?
-What's that?
-What was that?
-That's it.
-Sounded like a chest.
I wonder what's in it.
Bring it up here!
There it is!
-It's a satchel.
-Hold it up!
-It's a satchel!
-I got it.
Open it up.
Come on!
Bingo!
I say, chaps, shouldn't we find a spot of cover?
There's nobody around.
Come on. Count it out.
-What are we waiting for?
-Now wait a second!
Everybody's going to get something, so no arguments. We all get equal shares!
He's right.
That's the only way to do it.
Shares for everybody.
Now, how many are we?
One, two...
...three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
15 of us. That means 15 equal shares.
You dirty double-crosser.
You cut yourself in for twice!
You can't get away with that!
Get him!
Grab him!
Get him!
You only cheated yourself because now you're out.
Listen!
You can't cut me out now, you hear?
Not after what I've been through!
All right. Okay.
I'm warning you, if I don't get a share,
I'm going straight to the police.
-The police?
-What makes you think the police--
That money had to come from somewhere.
We know where it's from, that poor man that died on the mountain.
You wasn't even there, so shut up.
Okay, you asked for it.
I'm going straight to the police.
You think they'd be interested, Mr. Meyer?
Are you kidding? Isn't it obvious?
How do you think money gets....
How did you know my name?
You know this crook?
I've never met him, Mr. Pike, but I've come to feel that I know him.
How did you know my name?
I've never met you.
Yeah, who are you?
Didn't he come with you?
He didn't come with us.
We thought he came with you.
No.
If he didn't come with us, then who are you?
I'm Capt. Culpeper...
...of the Santa Rosita Police Department.
-Will you come to the point?
-Yeah, I'm coming to it.
Point is, I have enough stuff in my private files...
...stuff relating to civic building...
...road contracts, harbor and cannery projects...
...enough stuff to put you, the D.A., myself...
...and a two-thirds majority behind bars for the next 20 years.
And I give you my word, that's exactly where everybody's going...
-...unless things start happening now.
-Like what, for instance?
I want the pension for Culpeper's grade trebled.
Not doubled, trebled.
I want Culpeper to retire with honor.
I want it on paper that that's exactly what's going to happen.
And I want it in my hands in 15 minutes...
...or I'll have all the reporters in town in here in 20.
You know the word for this, Your Honor.
It's called blackmail.
Sir, could you possibly see your way clear to give us a break?
You kidding? Him give you a break?
We had a pretty rough day already.
We was all covered with dirt, and we fell down in an airplane...
...and my grandmother's dying in Oxnard.
I know we don't deserve any kindness, Captain.
But if you could help us,
I'm sure we'd all be inspired...
...to live better lives.
There is one thing.
I don't know whether it would help or not.
But if, instead of my turning you in...
...you went and turned yourselves in...
...juries sometimes look very favorably on things like that.
You'd let us do that?
What are we waiting for?
Let's turn ourselves in.
You must be a fine human being.
After all, why should you worry whether we get a break?
Mr. Meyer, no matter what you've all done today...
...you're not really criminals.
So if you like, you can all hop into those two cabs...
...and drive over to Santa Rosita...
...and just walk in.
-Then let's do that.
-But, sir, we can't all fit.
You can't take the stolen vehicles.
Those have to stay to be picked up later.
-What are we waiting for?
-Let's go.
Back in the back.
Drive carefully.
They may be the last passengers you'll ever carry.
Funny. That's funny.
Funny, right? Funny?
You could be the most comical cop I ever met.
Yeah.
-Culpeper.
-Yes, sir.
Everything is under control here.
It'll take a little longer because there was a joker in the deck...
...that nobody knew about. All right?
Yes, sir.
So don't make a move of any kind until you hear from me.
Yes, sir.
Listen, why does the man want to give everybody a break?
-What's his angle there?
-I was wondering about that, too.
Something funny's going on.
How's he know what we're going to do?
We're in enough of a mess.
We better do what he said.
I'm tellin' you, the man has got some angle.
Wait, wait. Hold it!
Can you see him?
-Just what does he think he's doing?
-That certainly is strange.
-Sure is.
-What is he doing?
-He's going the other way.
-Why are we standing here?
That's it!
We're off the hook!
Get out of here! Come on, we're off!
Come on, get going.
Holy mackerel. Almost didn't make it.
No other cops around. He planned it.
We found the money and he was waiting to take it away from us.
But if we all find the money first and turn it in, we're all in the clear.
Let's just get the dough and worry about the rest later.
-Look. He's slowing down.
-No, he's turning to the left.
What's going on?
Sorry, Jimmy.
He's heading for the border!
We should stop and call the police station!
You shut up!
We're going to get that money.
Keep driving!
That woman is something else.
Take your foot off the brake!
Stop hitting me. I'm driving.
-When you want a cab, you can't get one.
-Yeah, come on, let's go!
F-14 to Central.
Come in. What is it?
There's something phony here.
We're on 101 by Cortez
checking a mad-dog report.
Orders were to maintain silence.
Capt. Culpeper wants this channel kept clear.
We know it, but we saw Capt. Culpeper.
He just went by doing 90 miles an hour.
I don't think I understand that.
Are you sure it was Capt. Culpeper?
-Yep.
-Was he chasing anybody?
-Nope.
-Could he have been chasing anybody?
Not a chance.
That's what struck us so funny.
There were about 15 people
in two cabs behind him.
It looked like they were chasing him.
They were chasing him?
What's going on here?
I brought it myself.
Everything you asked for.
-The pension?
-Yeah.
Call Capt. Culpeper.
Calling Capt. Culpeper.
Central Division. Urgent.
Calling Capt. Culpeper.
-This can only happen in America.
-You going to start that again?
You've got to believe me.
I'm going to be sick.
What's the matter? You trying to kill us?
Just don't make me nervous!
-Don't let him get away!
-Cut him off!
Calling Capt. Culpeper.
Culp, this is Aloysius speaking.
Now, listen to me, Culp.
Everything has been fixed.
There's been negotiations
and everything is all right.
Cut out this nonsense and answer me.
This is Aloysius speaking.
I still don't understand this.
What's it all about?
That's it.
All units...
...arrest Capt. Culpeper.
There he is!
-Come back!
-Get me out of here!
Just don't sit there. Come on.
Come on!
Stop pushing, will ya?
Wait. We got him.
Now, you women stay here.
What do you mean,
"You women stay here"?
You heard him, mother. Stay here!
Come on! Let's go!
-Is he there?
-Where'd he go?
Halt! Halt!
Now, wait a minute. Listen.
Yeah!
Stop pushing! Get the suitcase.
Look! Look up there!
...in this regard, and there is no doubt....
Those ladders are not safe!
Ladders are not safe!
Get off!
-You got it?
-Get it away.
Get moving!
Don't push. You got it? That's it.
Sylvester, what are you doing up there?
You must be out of your mind!
-Wait a minute!
-Get the suitcase!
Get that money!
Don't you dare touch any of that money.
-You! Don't stand there!
-To your right!
Russell, hang on!
Dingy, I can't hold on!
Help us!
Get off my hand!
Move onto the ladder!
Hold on! Wait a minute!
One at a time! Did you hear me?
One at a time!
All right!
All right, you'll see. You'll see.
Get on alphabetical. I'm Benjy.
Quit stepping on my head!
Get on the ladder.
Get on the ladder.
Don't leave me! Come back here!
You can't leave me!
There's too many men on it to control it.
Hold it steady. Watch it.
She's whipping loose.
Wind us down!
I don't want the money!
Look out!
Get off!
She's going! Get out of there!
It's all your fault.
It's your fault from beginning to end.
You know, even for a policeman...
...your behavior was ruddy outrageous.
You could've taken a fair share like the rest of us...
...but no, you had to grab up the whole scene, baby.
We had $350,000 right in our hands.
Fourteen into $350,000....
Shut up.
I wish I knew what they were gonna do to us.
But no matter what happens to us,
I hope what happens to you will be worse.
I don't think you have to worry too much about that.
My wife is divorcing me.
My mother-in-law is suing me for damages.
My daughter is applying to the courts to have her name changed.
My pension has been revoked.
And the only reason that you 10 idiots...
...will very likely get off lightly...
...is because the judge will have me up there to throw the book at.
That's tough.
I'd like to think that sometime, maybe 10 or 20 years from now...
...there'd be something
I could laugh at, anything.
Now, see here, you idiots, it's all your fault because--
Get away from me!
Let me go!
This man has been brought to me as one who misleads the people.
He is accused of sedition and blasphemy, for which he should suffer death.
My Lord Governor!
My Lord Governor...
...there is a custom in Jerusalem, that at this season of the feast...
...one condemned man should be released.
I remember the custom.
Who shall it be?
This man who many of you call their king?
Or shall it be Barabbas?
Release Barabbas!
- Release Jesus of Nazareth!
- No, not Barabbas!
- Barabbas!
- Release Barabbas! Crucify the Nazarene!
They're mad, Lord Governor.
Barabbas is a rebel.
A robber, an assassin.
Release Barabbas!
Take the Nazarene, scourge him and bring him here again...
...and he shall be crucified.
All right, that's enough.
Take him out.
Open up.
Come on.
One man to be set free.
Set free?
You ought to know the custom of the season.
The Governor offered them either the prophet or you.
He listened to the voices and they chose you.
I make no comment.
Come on. Get on the move.
All right.
Give us a hair of your beard.
It ought to be lucky, considering how things have gone for you.
I'm not used to the light. It plays tricks.
If I was you, I shouldn't loiter.
I'd want to see the back of this place before they change their minds.
Get on your way, will you?
- Who do you think you're shoving?
- Get going.
All right. I'm going.
Move on.
- There he is. Release the Nazarene!
- Get out of the way.
What are you standing for, like an idiot?
What are you all hanging around for?
Here's a fine sight.
Six weeks and nobody's moved.
What's happened then?
How did you get out?
This is a surprise, let me tell you.
Is that my duck? It's him!
- Sara!
- There's the black knave himself...
...come back to his own.
Cheating his death again, like a good boy.
The clever one. How did you do it?
I was released to celebrate the holiday as a surprise for you.
Here's a day to celebrate in all my god.
Come on and tell us the whole story.
You've not heard?
I'm the choice of the people.
"Give us Barabbas," they said.
Give me some food.
Food for Barabbas. Food for a hungry man.
How does it feel?
How did you feel when they told you?
The choice of the people, eh?
Old Sara here dropping tears so fast all the slopping wine got watered.
- Where did you get your luck?
- What witch gave you that?
Pass him across to me!
- Touch him for luck. That's it.
- I'm not taking chances.
Get away.
Where's Rachel?
Shut away mourning for me?
Fetch her down here.
She's no good for you or anyone else.
- She's completely changed, I'm telling you.
- What's wrong with her? Bring her down.
She's no good to my old rascal now.
She thinks of nothing, day or night...
...except this prophet from Nazareth, who's on trial for blasphemy.
Ever since she heard him preach, she has gone off her life...
...like a sick child goes off its food.
Come on, you old empty belly.
There's no food inside you worth vomiting.
Sit down and eat.
Barabbas, that girl's no good for you.
Take my word for it.
As morbid as a crow in a chimney.
Bewitched by a prophet.
A waste of a handsome girl.
And she's gone to his trial looking like a widow already.
She knows what happened to her prophet.
That's the end of him.
- Condemned, was he?
- That's just it.
They had the choice between him and me, and they chose me. How do you like that?
The idol of the city.
Tell you what.
You're as good as a king, Barabbas.
They call the prophet King of the Jews, but they chose you.
Show your respects to King Barabbas.
- Let's have a crowning of him.
- Yes!
- The wicked old King of Judea.
- What are you doing?
- Come on, give him his robes.
- You be nice to your King Barabbas.
More wives than Solomon and his subjects as ripe as old pumpkins.
Here's your sceptre. Take it.
Set him on his throne.
- What's that?
- That's the sceptre.
Sit down on your throne.
Kneel down, all you miserable scum of the earth, and acknowledge.
Kneel down, you scum of the earth.
Hail! Hail!
I'll make laws for you that will tax your constitutions.
I crown you, King Barabbas.
Here she is, Barabbas, if you want her.
Look here, Rachel, look who's been asking for you.
The old rascal back from the dead.
So, here she is.
What's the matter with me?
Why don't you look at me?
Barabbas, let me go.
Not until you've told me you're glad I'm alive.
- I wouldn't wish any man his death.
- What do you mean by that?
Don't make me speak to you.
- What do you mean by that?
- Don't make me speak to you.
That's a warm welcome.
I couldn't follow any further.
I daren't say what is still to come, but God forgive us all if he can.
What did I tell you?
She's no good to you now, Barabbas.
Come on.
I'm not here to be made a fool of.
What's the matter?
Remember how it used to be.
Barabbas, don't you see what's happening?
Don't you understand what set you free?
I just got out of prison.
I need to get the cramp out of my bones.
That's what's happened.
- I'm not the same. Nothing is the same.
- You'd better try and make it the same.
Barabbas, listen to me.
For pity's sake believe me.
He came from God, the man who's taking your place.
You think I should have been killed instead of him?
You think I ought to be dead?
Barabbas, hear what I say.
He came from God.
That's none of my worry.
God can look after his own.
- And you can look after me.
- No!
That girl up there was always coming back with strange ideas.
She's got her head full of them.
Well, it seems she's got something to think about now, anyway.
- I don't like the look of it.
- Look of what? What's the matter?
The sky. The light's gone out of it.
I've never known it dark like this in the middle of the day.
Get a light, for mercy's sake.
Something's wrong with my eyes.
I can't see.
Something's wrong.
Everything's black.
Black as death.
I knew there was something wrong when I saw that light.
Tell me. Am I going blind?
Am I going blind?
What's happening?
You know what has happened.
Even the light has left us, now that we've killed him.
Well, are you satisfied now?
He's dead.
Just the same as any other man.
- We've seen it. That's the end of it.
- He promised to come back.
We shall see that, too.
Only two days and he'll be in the world again.
Look at his friends.
You think they believe it?
I tell you, you're mad. That's the end of it.
Not tomorrow, but the morning after.
How many days have I been here?
How many days have I been here?
Can't you hear me?
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter? Two days.
Two days.
Then today's the third day?
Two and one make three. What's so odd?
We'll see, then.
This is the morning of the third day.
Barabbas, where are you going?
Now you know it's true.
All I know is the tomb is empty.
- Who moved the stone?
- God moved it.
God himself? You saw him do it?
A power came from the sky.
It was when the sun was rising, at the beginning of the day.
- First there was the music of a horn.
- Horn?
Then in the air there was an angel.
The whole sky seemed to dismantle.
It was white, it was fire.
It was white fire.
He stretched out his arm.
It seemed as long as a spear.
The point of the spear went between the stone and the rock...
...and the stone rolled away.
If only you had been here sooner and seen what I saw.
My eyes are good.
They see nothing but real things.
You have to believe this, Barabbas.
The Master was a man of truth, and he said this would be so.
Did you see a prophet come out of the tomb?
My eyes were so dazzled.
I think I must have covered them.
But when I could see again...
...a man and a woman were together in the garden. Then the woman was alone.
And then she went quickly away.
And the man was the same man they buried in there?
He was like a shadow.
The morning light was behind him.
But I'm sure it was he.
Shadows, light, that's about the truth of it.
Here's the truth of it:
Why do you think he should lie about himself...
...when it meant he would be killed?
How do you know what he said?
The priests ought to know more than you do. And they call it blasphemy.
He said:
"Love one another."
"Love one another"?
And they crucified him for that?
Where are you going?
There are those who can tell you more.
There's a house in the street of the potters where they meet.
You may find them there.
Go and ask them.
It's a trick they're playing.
They took the body and hid it to go on with their story.
Or are you afraid?
Are you afraid of knowing what has happened?
Are you looking for someone?
You like to see it?
The clay making itself?
Some other day.
What's happened? I heard there was news.
The tomb's empty, the women said they saw him.
Creed can have strange visions.
Only it's true. Where's Peter?
Who could it be?
Don't open it.
We should get out of this city.
Wiser to go down to Galilee.
Can we hide from the future forever?
Let's see what is here.
What if they mean to destroy us all?
Leaving no one to tell the knowledge of the man.
Can the word turn to silence?
I'm not afraid of that.
Where is he?
- What have you done with him?
- What do you want with us?
- The truth. What happened?
- What right have you to be here?
You know what I mean.
What are you all afraid of?
What are we afraid of?
You want to know what we want to know.
- What is the truth of this morning?
- I know the truth.
You stole the body.
You think we might have hidden it here among us.
But something else has happened.
If you find him here, it will only be if he comes himself.
Through that gate, as you did just now.
Don't you believe it. I saw the body.
He was a dead man.
If you were sure of that, you wouldn't be here.
He's risen.
I trust in him and wait.
You're all mad.
What do you think you're doing, making that net?
There's no sea to fish in closer than Galilee.
It's what I'm used to doing, my hands go to it.
But the streets in the cities have to be the sea for me now.
He made a joke about it when he took us away from the boats.
He said that in the future our fish would be men.
It was a serious joke.
It meant he'd given us the word to draw men out of the dark sea...
...into the light.
And you call yourself a fisherman?
Do I have to tell you what happens to the fish?
They struggle about, gasp and die.
We struggle and gasp.
You said something good.
Poor fish.
I, too...
...must struggle and gasp.
And die.
And die in order to live.
That's where men have the advantage over fish.
They can die to the world, die to the dark sea...
...and begin to live again in the light.
That's what he promised, and what he promised has happened.
But what has happened...
...we still don't know.
He's come back to life.
- He'll lead us to the new kingdom.
- I'll believe it when he's before us.
When I can touch him and hear him.
You're always full of doubts without any cause.
No cause to doubt that a dead man can come back to life?
No cause.
I can take you now to talk with a man who was dead.
The Master brought him back to life.
Thomas knows him well.
Come, talk to him.
Let him tell you.
You needn't be afraid.
Lazarus? Will you come to us?
Here's someone wants to question you.
Come in.
I'll leave you with him.
You can ask him whatever you like.
They told me death is not...
Is not death.
They brought me here to see...
...because you could make me believe it.
Because you were dead, and were raised from the dead by the man.
I mean...
...the Master.
That is true.
I was dead.
And I know that he is Christ...
...the Son of God...
...who has power over life and death.
What's it like there?
You were there.
- Tell me what it's like.
- Like?
- Like?
- Yes, what is it...
...this thing you experienced?
What is it?
I have experienced nothing.
Only death.
And death is nothing.
Nothing?
No.
What should it be?
You want me to tell you about the realm of the dead?
I cannot.
How would you tell an unborn child what life is?
It exists.
But it isn't anything.
To those who've been there...
...nothing else is anything either.
No one has asked me this before.
They have listened how life came back to me and gone away praising.
Only you have asked about death.
And none the wiser.
We're two men who might be dead.
Sharing his body.
Life.
Love one another.
Listen, everybody! That's the word.
Love one another!
We can tell them about loving one another.
- Leave me alone. I want to sit.
- What do you want to do, sit and think?
It's no good thinking.
Come on, let's go and find a new life.
- Where are you going, Barabbas?
- To see what "brought back to life" means.
Love one another!
- Come on.
- My shoe.
Look.
- Hey! Get up! Come on!
- Leave it alone.
Stay alive.
It's all you have to do.
It's not my fault they let him get killed.
You can't hang it around my neck.
I've as much right to be alive as any of you.
You stinking fish.
You're afraid to look at me because I'm alive.
You, look at me. Look at me!
It may be today that the new world comes.
Today or tomorrow.
But it will come, you will see.
Every day you have promised us, it has never come.
- It will never come.
- It will come. I know it.
Please, Rachel, tell us again what it will be like.
You'd better mind what you say.
Don't you know what can happen to you if they hear you?
Anybody now caught spreading such stories...
...the Son of God, the Messiah and such, is to be judged an enemy of the State...
...and stoned until he's dead.
It will be as though the Earth has become like a star burned clean.
Everything evil swept away.
We shall look up and there will be angels coming down from the sky...
...and they will put food in front of us and perhaps new clothes to wear.
White, like their own.
Or some blue, like the colour of the sky.
Pain and sorrow will sink into the ground, and everything will be made new...
...because the Son of God has risen from the dead.
The world has become his kingdom.
There's no truth in any of it.
I know this woman.
She doesn't know the difference between what is real...
...and what she dreamed in her sleep.
Don't you listen to her.
She's raking up trouble.
Nothing but trouble.
Trouble for you...
...if you won't turn and listen to the sounds that have come.
He knows but is afraid to believe it.
Look at you, Barabbas.
How can you see or hear what's to come?
It will happen, whether you take part in it or not.
He's right. It's dangerous talk.
They'll pull down our homes, drive us out.
Better listen to this man.
- Let's hear what the prophet said.
- Don't leave. Where are you going?
To where the lepers are, to tell them to be ready for the freedom that's coming.
- She's going among the lepers!
- Stop her!
She's going to set the lepers free.
- Don't let her go among the lepers!
- Don't let her set the lepers free!
You have no right to go among the lepers!
Look out, it's a temple guard!
We don't want the lepers to be free!
A charge has been lodged against this woman.
- She must be questioned.
- We heard she preaches blasphemy.
Bring her to the temple and we will judge her.
- Take your dirty hands off her.
- Don't take her! She's done no wrong.
Don't take her away.
Rachel!
For blasphemy, and spreading blasphemy, this woman is condemned.
For stirring up evil matters among the people...
...for misleading their minds and denying the wisdom of authority.
For her sins, she has been condemned to death by stoning.
Let the man who accused her and was found just in his accusation...
...cast the first stone.
What must I do?
Take this stone.
Come on. Throw it at her.
Why should I throw?
- I've nothing against her.
- You accused her.
- The law gives you the first stone.
- It was you.
Or you'll find yourself there beside her.
Throw quickly. If you wait, I may be afraid.
You don't have to think of Barabbas any more. He's not coming back.
And if he did, we'd know what to do with him.
You're still afraid of him because he used to roar at you like a brass bull.
You can't stand up to him even when he's gone.
He's gone to the devil once and for all,
I can tell you.
He's lost his nerve.
He's creeping about the city like a shivering priest.
Why do you think he's not come back?
Because he's afraid to stir hand or foot.
- We don't know yet, he won't come back.
- Who cares if he does?
We got a man here who can hang him in his own guts.
He came out of that prison mad.
Acquitted but mad.
We'll soon see it then.
So, you remembered the way to get here.
Given you up this past week.
You'll find things altered.
What's over is over.
I remembered the way.
Bring them across.
God's curse on you! The money is sacred!
It belongs to the temple!
- The god of battle will destroy you!
- Blasphemy!
You hypocrites. I'll kill you both.
What are you doing?
Here's all the treasure we wanted.
Come away!
I'll kill you the way you had her killed.
It seemed to me at the time, Barabbas, when you were given your liberty before...
...it wasn't a fortunate exchange.
They were calling for death and disorder when they called your name.
This is what I thought and this is what has occurred.
They put the scourge back into the fist.
By that I mean you and your life.
And many men have suffered and died in consequence.
The other man, too.
They're dying because of that.
This is a local matter, which I hope will soon be adjusted.
The shock and fear of an unreasoning fanaticism will pass.
But the appetite to destroy...
...which, alas, the human being shares with the wild beast, is always with us.
And it has rigorously to be disciplined in the name of civilization...
...and according to the law.
- That's what you say.
But I tell you, whichever side of the law we're on, we're the same men.
You and your kind, and me and my kind.
How else have you lived except my way?
What we haven't got, we go out and take.
Let him speak.
How else have you lived except my way?
Whoever's against us or gets in our way, we get rid of.
My knife may have bitten a few throats, but what about your weapons?
They've split thousands upon thousands.
If I've taken a passing woman to myself...
...your armies have looted and raped across continents.
And have been called the glory of the earth for doing it.
You were born according to the law and raised according to the law.
I was born by a girl thrown out of a brothel...
...who gave birth and cursed me before she died.
But I tell you, we belong to the same herd.
Unfortunately for you, Barabbas, the law is indispensable.
The law is the pass and permit to life in this world.
You were without it.
However, the law here tells me...
...that a man released by the will of the people at a holy festival...
...cannot thereafter be given a capital punishment.
You can't kill me?
Easier on you if we could.
I sentence you to transportation for life, whatever that's worth...
...to the sulphur mines on the island of Sicily.
I can't...
...be killed.
He meant me to live.
Deliberately he did it.
No killing Barabbas.
No death for Barabbas.
He died in my place.
The death has been paid.
He's taken my death.
That's it. He's taken my death.
That light, that wasn't light.
The dark, that wasn't dark.
That wasn't dark, that was life.
- That was life.
- Take the man away.
You'll die and rot, but I'll live forever!
I've got my life and you can't take it!
You stinking fish!
I've got my life and you can't have it!
I've got my life!
- Well, which are you?
- I'm Scorpus.
That means nothing, idiot.
What's your number?
- That's better.
- Who's the god?
- The divine Emperor Tiberius.
You have the privilege of being his property.
Move.
Go on, move.
That's all. Move on. Next two.
Put your back to it.
Move. Get your feet on the ground.
What are they doing?
They're sending us down to the next level to make room for you.
That's how you know how long you've been here...
...by how deep you're down.
They break you in gradually to get used to the dark.
Wait.
You've gotten used to the dark.
Did it take long?
Long enough.
It's got into me.
Come here.
What do you see?
You're blind.
Sulphur burns.
Dig.
Here.
You've got a partner there that seems to know how to live forever.
Better learn from him.
How long has it been?
Who was emperor then?
Tiberius? That was long ago.
Almost in another world.
Here, I'm called Sahak.
That's mine.
Here.
Move!
You make this even a worse hell than it is.
You don't care how I got here...
...but I'll tell you.
The ship I was serving on took on a cargo of slaves.
Some of them got free.
Slipped over the side, during my watch.
So, the captain put the chains on me.
What about your world?
What's your name?
- I asked you what your name is.
- All right.
If it's going to keep you quiet.
Barabbas.
What are you saying?
Barabbas.
What's the town you came from?
Jerusalem.
Are you the man they acquitted?
What is that to you?
Chained to you, of all men on Earth.
That's what I like to see, devils and beasts going for each other's throats.
Here's a head of you to hate each other.
Now work, you crazy dogs.
Let's see you working.
Work!
Get out! Move!
You hate my name.
You hate the sound of it.
You weren't even in Jerusalem, but you hate my name.
That's right. We hate it.
What does it matter?
What does it matter to you?
- You know who was killed in your place?
- Still that?
So, why shouldn't we hate your name?
I thought what he said was to love one another.
I can't imagine...
...he expects a man to have a spirit...
...as strong and patient as a dray horse.
It was only something I was told.
If you think I got the best of it, you stay here for a generation or two.
We've got a special duty for you two.
This'll show you what happens to fighting mongrels. Come on.
Why isn't it all forgotten?
That's what I don't understand.
Who's been spreading things about?
Keeping that tale alive all these years?
What could kill it?
When you think it was God's will come to Earth to show what he is.
I can see the reality of that.
Which is why the name of the Master goes on growing in the world.
I began to meet it wherever I sailed:
Phoenicia, Cyprus, Greece.
Even at the Port of Rome.
I began to understand what it meant.
But...
...it's a tough demand, the will of God.
I'm a poor hand at it.
And look where I've got us now.
Even though I've got his sign scratched on the back of the Emperor's head.
It means I belong to him, not to the Emperor.
It's the sign he has put on us all, if we give way enough to see it.
Look at this.
There's the shape of the cross.
Keep your God to yourself.
Why did you come here and rake up old lies about killing God?
What's going on down there?
Move yourselves or I'll leave you to rot.
Pull!
You think what it's like to me.
You're the only man I've met who saw him.
You were there at the beginning, and you won't talk.
You won't tell me.
- What are you afraid of?
- Nothing I'm afraid of.
Then you can tell me.
You see the darkness that went over heaven and Earth when he died?
Suppose I did.
The man died in a dust storm, the same as anybody's death.
Suppose his tomb was empty.
Can't a dead man be taken away?
You want the truth? I'll give it to you.
That's all of your God you'll get out of me.
Here, what's the matter?
Come on, get up.
If they see you can't work they take you and you won't come back.
Hey! Away!
All right, wake up.
- Come on. Move out, all of you.
- Get on your feet. You've had your sleep.
- You two, get your feet on the ground.
- Get out of there. Come on. Move!
Root yourselves out! Move, I say!
Wake up.
All right, there's work to be done.
- You've had enough sleep now.
- Wake up.
Come on, you! You, over there.
Wake up, you hear me?
- Get on your feet, I say.
- One dead man here.
I said get on your feet, all of you.
Now come on. Up on your feet.
- You've got to look as if you can work.
- What's the matter with you?
You can't stand up? Can't work?
I can work.
Here, this one's no use.
- How many survivors?
- None, sir. There can't be any.
- It was like the end of the world to them.
- The end of the underworld.
- What did you say, sir?
- Nothing.
Survivors!
Over here. Survivors.
Get ready to receive survivors!
Away.
Pull!
When they've recovered, put them to work in the fields.
I can taste the salt in the air.
Every breath of wind is full of the sea.
I thought I could never love it better than I did. But, oh, glory!
After the darkness of the mines...
...I could go and drown in it like a man besotted.
Now, are you glad to live?
What? Like a damned ox?
Salt me down and I'd praise God even for this.
How many times were you swindled in those foreign ports?
You must've been the easiest game they ever got their hands on.
- Why is that?
- You'd fall for any trick.
One smile...
...and you trust the world that half kills you.
Yes, I trust it.
It has to be hard going...
...or else how will the strength come that God has wanted?
God should make himself plain or leave me alone.
Am I the one who lets himself be swindled, or you?
Every time he came near, you refused to believe it.
But it's never been out of your mind.
What other man's death could have troubled you so long?
Stop there. Pull over to the side.
Rock to be carried.
Here.
It's a poor scratching, but the true sign.
Now will you leave me in peace?
All right, we go on.
Wait.
Julia, there are the two men
I was telling you about.
Send for them, Rufio. I want to see them.
- Bring those men over here to us.
- Very good, sir.
Stop! These two.
Take them off the plough.
Two men so strangely come up from the underworld.
Twenty years in the mines, the old one.
Indestructible.
I heard so.
You've earned the air you breathe, you two, by sheer good fortune.
- What are your names?
- Sahak, sir.
- And yours?
- Barabbas.
What's your age?
What does it matter?
Indeed, what should it matter?
We understand you mean to live forever.
I must touch them for the luck that's in them.
My wife thinks your merit is contagious.
All right, we don't want to hold up the work.
Back now.
It's from the Emperor.
It seems the gods approve your superstition.
We're to call to Rome.
- To Rome? What does it mean?
- I'm to enter the Senate.
- We're to rise in the world.
- Rufio. Rome!
It's true. They are charmed.
We must always take them with us.
A good thing I touched them.
I see, their success, not mine.
Nothing but amiable days from now on, and knowing everybody instead of nobody.
- When shall we go?
- Ride with us. I'll give you the answer.
How wretched to arrive when all have gone to the mountains...
Look over there.
Well, here we have to leave your luck to learn its business.
What do you mean?
Why do we come here?
They cannot fight yet.
They must first learn the skill.
And so they will.
But here we have to deliver them over.
Let's hope they won't disgrace us.
When a charmed life turns professional, we can expect great things.
Flacus, the Commander.
You honour Rome and us.
Our happiness is all here, Commander.
Unsurpassable. The Emperor has given him his freedom three times.
There's the third staff of liberty in his hand.
Always he prefers to come back.
He knows his empire and has the sense to keep it.
Keep it he does.
He's taken a fair toll of them.
Torvald, the Senator Rufio and his lady.
I'll take this life.
Can't a man be made mad by the smell of blood?
A man can understand this.
To throw the net, hold it to your right, like this.
Then throw from the tips of your fingers, like this.
Your places now.
One here, you here and you over there.
Now, start your practice. Throw your nets.
What's this?
Have they mistaken this place for an old men's hospital?
The grey-haired one?
They say there's something remarkable about him. Nothing can kill him.
Show me what you can do, grandfather.
What do we do with aging fish, grandfather?
It's time he was thrown to the gulls.
Let me be.
Hit! One!
Hit! Two!
You move on.
Bring out the first group of gladiators.
You remember me?
You drew the sign of the Master beside my plate.
How did you know I carried the sign?
Several days I've watched you breaking the bread.
Can we speak freely?
He was there in Jerusalem.
He knew the Master.
God be praised and keep you safe.
The days have been getting darker for us.
Persecution increasing.
The Emperor wants to destroy every trace of us.
But tomorrow, when the games are over and the sun is down...
...discipline will be lax...
...and there may be a chance for me to lead you to where we meet.
The Master's disciple, Peter, is here in Rome.
Seldom enough I find my way there, some way off to the catacombs.
The catacombs?
Surely it's the dead who meet there.
It may seem to you that the faith is buried.
But so is the seed before there can be a harvest.
First group, assemble.
You shall see tomorrow the life we keep there.
First group, assemble.
- Did you hear him, Barabbas?
- I heard.
One, two, one, two...
To your fighting places.
Go.
When you've taken up these positions tomorrow...
...the trumpets will sound.
And from above you, there...
...the white cloth will be thrown into the arena.
When it touches the ground, the contest will begin.
To make sure you understand, this is the way it will happen.
Kill him! Kill him!
- That's an angry crowd.
- They want blood.
They were driven to a frenzy by Sahak, who wouldn't kill his man.
If the Emperor were here, he wouldn't have had a choice.
Wait till tomorrow.
He'll get his quota of killing, if you're lucky to win.
- Not one life will he get from me.
- Won't he?
Say that to the Emperor.
He will teach you the ways.
- When he says death, death it is.
- The true God says life.
- I only answer to him.
- Hark at this man.
By God, if he contradicts the Emperor...
- Who do you call your God?
- The only one.
The rest are inventions of fear, tales taken from the past...
...they can no more help you than this breast can bleed.
Put 'em down.
- Insulting the gods before we go fight.
- What revenge will Mars take?
None at all. He doesn't exist.
Mars doesn't exist?
What do you mean, he doesn't exist?
Will you keep your mouth shut?
The real God is greater than any man's thoughts can imagine.
He made life as deep and strong as the sea.
Your gods are as shallow as a reeking pond.
He's above us and around us, in us.
Like the breath in our bodies.
And he has one law that will break our pattern.
The law is love.
Whatever we do that breaks that law condemns us.
And so that we should see what his love is...
...he sent his son to live the life of a man.
To show that God understands the life he has made.
- Who spun you this?
- What do you want us to do?
What good will he do us in the arena?
We'll lose the goodwill of the gods we know.
Tomorrow in the arena, show the Emperor that we know what life's worth.
Throw away your weapons.
Do you think all the things of the Earth and the heavens...
...have been made for no other reason except we should eat and make money...
...and spawn children and kill and die?
What a purpose for creation!
If anything's beyond belief, that is.
God said, " Burn away the old world...
"...and let a new one rise from the ashes."
As the Son of God rose from the dead, he died for us.
Ask Barabbas here the truth of what I tell you.
He saw with his own eyes the Son of God when he lived among us.
Saw him die.
Was there, in the garden, on the third morning.
You saw him, Barabbas?
- Tell us what you saw.
- What happened?
A long time ago I saw a man.
Some people say he was...
...the Son of God.
- Enough!
You've condemned yourselves.
I charge you with sedition and stirring up mutiny.
You're both under arrest.
Take them out and put them in chains.
Move now!
Let me be sure you understand the seriousness of the charge against you.
Not only with holding views proscribed by the State...
...for which the punishment is death, but of recommending those views...
...to men sworn to the State's service.
What is more, you've betrayed your faith to me...
...who brought you to this city...
...and laid me under possible suspicion of connivance in the eyes of the Emperor.
The prospect is black for you.
You know what this is?
- The stamp of the Roman State.
- Which means that you're Rome's property.
What's this cut here?
The sign of my master.
- Who do you call your master?
- The one who is my lord.
- The Son of the Father.
- In other words, the Christian sign?
A religion which sets itself up to menace government and order.
Which denies the divine authority of the Emperor.
Which preaches that the slave is equal to the free man...
...and would reduce society to anarchy.
A rebellious, insufferable doctrine.
Give me a direct answer.
Do you belong to the State?
I belong to the Lord, my god.
So, you also believe in this god?
Tell me, do you?
You don't?
Then why do you bear his name on your disc?
Isn't he your god?
Isn't that what the inscription means?
I have no god.
I don't understand.
Why then do you bear this sign of Jesus Christ, scratched on your disc?
Because I...
...tried to believe.
I'll give you the opportunity to recover your senses.
If you'll admit publicly to the men you spoke to...
...that all these things were lies, you may save your life.
Will you do this?
That would be to lose my life, not save it.
What I am is his.
But isn't life dear to you?
Yes, it is.
And you understand the cruel death that punishes mutiny and sedition?
What do you choose?
I choose my god.
Then there is no more I can do for you.
Guilty of the charge.
Execution at sunrise.
You're as mad as your god.
You, come here.
Unwise to carry around with you what you don't believe in.
It may be the Master means you to live.
He may have some greater need of you.
Some other purpose, Barabbas.
- Something else.
- Take him away.
Guards.
Now you'll have to be worth two men to take his place.
You may go.
You are to witness the punishment of this man...
...so that there can be no doubt in your mind...
...that the words he spoke to you were a gross breach of the law.
An iniquitous crime against the State.
Not only lies, but treasonable lies...
...which were not only aimed at spreading rebellion among you...
...but also to pervert your minds...
...from those acceptable religions on which the State is built.
Any man who thinks that those words are harmless...
...or thinks that he can repeat or conform to such words as this man spoke...
...let him take warning from the punishment you are about to witness.
Long live the Emperor!
Proceed, Torvald.
Positions.
Ready.
Throw.
Traitors and fools!
You'll wish this was better done.
Kill him! Kill him!
Gladiator Barabbas, you're becoming quite a legend among us, I hear.
For your remarkable persistence in life...
...we have a traditional answer to this public acclaim.
We make you a free man.
We give you your liberty.
Here is the symbol of your freedom.
I brought him to you.
This is where he would have wanted to be buried.
Our brother Sahak.
So you had to carry your dead conscience here.
Did he have to die before you cared about him?
Are you more concerned with his body than his life?
You were willing to let him go to his death alone.
Why should you help him now he doesn't need you?
How could I have helped him by being killed?
He made his own death.
What good has it done?
I had to go on living, he said.
- There was something I still had to do.
- Barabbas, why should you believe it?
When the light shone, you wouldn't accept it.
When the dark came, you denied it.
When the spirit of God beckoned, you refused it.
When Sahak says your life is kept for some purpose...
...why should you believe it?
To make a gag for your conscience, is that it?
You believe it because it suits you.
Or maybe if Sahak stood before you now then you would say you believed.
You would repent and love God.
It would be easy.
But what strength would your belief have then?
What would it matter?
Jesus of Nazareth was killed instead of me.
There must have been a reason. Why me?
Why did he choose me?
Where have you gone?
You!
Where are you?
Wait for me.
Wait!
You wait!
For God's sake, where are you?
Show me the way! I'm lost!
Which way shall I go?
- What's happening?
- Rome is burning.
Can't you see? Rome is burning.
- What happened to make the fire?
- The Christians tried to burn down Rome.
- Move! Move that case. Come on.
- Christians?
- The Christians are burning Rome!
- It's the Christians!
Fire!
They're burning away the old world.
The new kingdom is coming.
God.
You won't find me failing this time.
What are you doing, madman?
Fire of God destroying the old world.
The hour has come when all is to perish.
- Are you a Christian?
- Yes, I am.
And I'm ready for Him!
The whole world will soon be ablaze.
Do you hear that?
We're burning the way.
We're ready for his coming.
- Take him away.
- The Master!
- The Master's coming to build a new world.
- Away!
Let me go!
I must make ready for his coming!
Let me go!
Here! Get yourself out of this one.
Here's one of your kind who was caught in the act, setting light to a storehouse.
He admits he's a Christian, burning the city to start a new kingdom.
The only honest man among you.
Who are you?
We've never seen you before.
Is it true?
Were you setting fire to a storehouse?
Yes.
- We've never seen you before.
- Who are you?
My name is Barabbas.
- Barabbas, the robber.
- Barabbas, the acquitted.
This burning city is no work of ours.
This isn't how the new kingdom is going to be made.
You were wrong.
Who are you to tell me I'm wrong?
Many years ago we spoke together.
You remember?
No.
You asked me why I was making a net so far from the sea.
Jerusalem.
The street of the potters.
You were mistaken of us then as you are again now.
We didn't set fire to the city.
You've done the work of the wild beast, the Emperor.
- Are you a lunatic?
- It was his fire, you fool, not God's.
Why can't God make himself plain?
What's become of all the fine hopes?
The trumpets, the angels?
All the promises?
Every time I've seen it end up the same way, with torments and dead bodies...
...with no good come of it.
All for nothing.
Do you think they persecute us to destroy nothing?
Or do you think that what has battered on your soul...
...for twenty years has been nothing?
It wasn't for nothing that Christ died.
Mankind isn't nothing.
In his eyes, each individual man is the whole world.
He loves each man as though there were no other.
I was the opposite of everything he taught, wasn't I?
Why did he let himself be killed instead of me?
Because being farthest from him, you were the nearest.
- I'm no nearer than I was before.
- Nor any farther away.
The truth of the matter is, he's never moved from your side.
I can tell you this.
There has been a wrestling in your spirit, back and forth in your life...
...which in itself is knowledge of God.
By the conflict you have known him.
I can tell you as well, that so it will be with the coming of the kingdom.
That wrestling back and forth and the labouring of the world spirit...
...like a woman in childbirth.
We are only the beginning.
We won't see the time when the Earth is full of the kingdom.
And yet, even now, even here...
...we are at the end ourselves.
The kingdom is within us.
There is nothing more to fear.
Upon us, the years will be built.
Many years, many martyrdoms.
The ground of men is very stubborn to mature.
But men will look back to us in our day and will wonder and remember our hope.
It is the end of the day.
We shall trust ourselves to a little pain...
... and sleep.
Saying to the world:
"God's speed."
What hour is it?
Night or day?
The sixth hour goes...
...when darkness...
Darkness...
I give myself up...
...into your keeping.
It is...
...Barabbas.

{26886}{26934}Hey, man, what are you doing?
{26998}{27049}I got to talk to you, man.
{27181}{27247}Everything we ever dreamed of|is in that gas tank.
{27253}{27312}You got a stranger pouring|gasoline on it.
{27318}{27394}All he's got to do is look into it|and he can see--
{27399}{27450}He won't know what it is, man.
{27456}{27519}Don't worry, Billy.|Everything's all right.
{27525}{27577}All right, man. I don't know.
{27583}{27613}I do.
{27636}{27684}Everything's fine, Billy.
{27998}{28069}That's all taken care of.
{28091}{28129}I like that.
{33156}{33235}-How much further do we got to go?|-I don't know.
{33269}{33310}Not much further.
{33346}{33400}That's what you said this morning.
{33429}{33491}I sometimes say it all day.
{33497}{33560}Really? You say it all day?
{33567}{33630}We don't have much longer.|We'll be there soon.
{33651}{33720}We got to get to Mardi Gras, man.
{33726}{33780}Your little heart is set on that, huh?
{33797}{33831}We got a week.
{33847}{33901}That's a week away, man.
{33907}{33970}It's a long way to Mardi Gras, baby.
{34006}{34071}It won't take us a week|to get to New Orleans.
{34331}{34383}I think I'm going to crash.
{34392}{34445}I think you have crashed, man.
{34716}{34790}I keep seeing things|jumping all over the place.
{34816}{34860}-Really?|-Yeah, look.
{34896}{34935}-What is it?|-It's a moth.
{34941}{34970}A what?
{34977}{35027}Moth. Bug.
{35186}{35235}This is a weird place, man.
{35271}{35320}That smoke's getting to me.
{35368}{35425}But I notice you're not moving.
{35560}{35605}Where are you from, man?
{35646}{35696}Can I have a light?
{35701}{35745}Where are you from, man?
{35822}{35853}Hard to say.
{35859}{35890}Hard to say?
{35896}{35935}Where are you from, man?
{35941}{36030}It's hard to say because|it's a very long word, you know?
{36064}{36115}I just want to know|where you're from.
{36192}{36221}The city.
{36237}{36275}From a city?
{36317}{36381}Doesn't matter what city.|They're all alike.
{36387}{36426}That's why I'm out here now.
{36432}{36480}That's why you're out here now?
{36486}{36520}Why?
{36537}{36586}Because I'm a long way from the city...
{36592}{36654}...and that's where|I want to be right now.
{36734}{36785}They know you in this place?
{36836}{36885}This place we're coming to?
{36895}{36946}The place where we're at now?
{36989}{37025}This place.
{37176}{37220}You're right on top of them.
{37225}{37275}I'm right on top of them?
{37295}{37385}The people this place belongs to|are buried right under you.
{37442}{37515}You could be a trifle polite.
{37521}{37570}"A trifle polite"?
{37607}{37665}A small thing to ask.
{37892}{37948}You ever want to be somebody else?
{38021}{38085}I'd like to try Porky Pig.
{38230}{38285}I never wanted to be anybody else.
{41189}{41255}You can't hit me. I'm invisible!
{41418}{41488}Hey, Sarah. How's it going?
{41692}{41745}Rudolph, what are you eating?
{41793}{41845}Thanks for the stuff you brought.
{41851}{41880}How's it going?
{41887}{41986}We can't take any more strangers.|Just too many people dropping in.
{41992}{42075}I'm not talking about|you and your friends.
{42095}{42191}Last week, Susan dropped in|with 1 2 people from Easter City.
{42197}{42266}She wanted to take|1 0 pounds of rice with her.
{42271}{42316}Naturally, we had to say no.
{42321}{42415}So she gets uptight, breaks out|some hash and won't give us any.
{42421}{42481}They went outside|to start their bus...
{42487}{42527}...and couldn't get it started.
{42533}{42615}I bet you haven't had anybody around|like me to rap to.
{42621}{42701}You know I love you|and I want you to rap.
{42707}{42768}-Oh, God! I want you to rap.|-Cut that out.
{42774}{42835}I guess nobody else here|is interested...
{42840}{42900}...but I'd sure like|to meet your friend.
{42907}{42965}I bet you'd like to do more than that.
{42987}{43026}I think he's beautiful.
{43032}{43062}He's beautiful.
{43081}{43135}What's that weird thing on the hill?
{43140}{43216}It looks like a stage.|You got a light opera company?
{43221}{43263}That's the mime troupe stage.
{43269}{43324}They've gone down to the hot springs.
{43332}{43371}Mime troupe?
{43425}{43448}Hey, Lisa?
{43477}{43516}What does this mean?
{43522}{43596}"Starting brings misfortune.
{43610}{43685}Perseverance brings danger.
{43698}{43803}Not every demand for change|in the existing order should be heeded.
{43808}{43891}On the other hand,|repeated and well-founded complaints...
{43897}{43951}...should not fail to a hearing."
{43956}{43981}Well, when one--
{43986}{44046}Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!
{44055}{44151}We've come to play for our dinner...
{44156}{44241}...or should I say,|stay for our dinner.
{44247}{44293}Or even...
{44302}{44353}...slay for our dinner.
{44381}{44461}Men at war.|How ghastly, ghastly!
{44467}{44526}We've come to drink your wine...
{44531}{44629}...taste your food|and take pleasure in your women.
{44634}{44694}The water in that river|is about 80 degrees.
{44700}{44778}You put your hand in a foot away,|it's below freezing.
{44783}{44854}Oh, come on.|I've got to get dinner on.
{44865}{44897}Who said "out" to me?
{44903}{44962}I picked--|Unhand me! I played communes--
{44968}{45009}Out! Out!
{45033}{45069}Evil eye on this place.
{45075}{45115}A double whammy for you all.
{45178}{45245}Come, my dear.|We won't play here.
{45378}{45412}Get out.
{45418}{45456}I like you.
{45668}{45741}These people got here|late in the summer.
{45747}{45816}Too late to plant.|But the weather was beautiful...
{45822}{45899}...and it was easy living.|And then came that winter.
{45917}{45989}There were 40 or 50|living in a one-room place.
{45995}{46107}Nothing to eat, out by the side|of the road looking for dead horses.
{46113}{46156}Anything they could get ahold of.
{46162}{46248}There's 1 8 or 20 left.|And they're city kids. Look at them.
{46391}{46431}But they're getting this crop in.
{46437}{46536}They'll stay here till it's harvested.|That's the whole thing.
{46711}{46761}Do you get much rain here, man?
{46773}{46836}I guess we'll have to dance for that.
{47161}{47226}Look at this, man. A seashell.
{47338}{47417}There's nothing but sand.|They ain't going to make it.
{47441}{47481}They're going to make it.
{47556}{47596}They're going to make it.
{49881}{49931}We have planted our seeds.
{50015}{50046}We ask...
{50085}{50136}...that our efforts be worthy...
{50166}{50226}...to produce simple food...
{50253}{50296}...for our simple taste.
{50376}{50426}We ask that our efforts...
{50450}{50491}...be rewarded.
{50602}{50676}We thank You for the food|we eat from other hands...
{50810}{50876}...that we may share it|with our fellow man...
{50932}{50981}...and be even more generous...
{51008}{51061}...when it is from our own.
{51201}{51247}Thank You for a place...
{51278}{51321}...to make a stand.
{51523}{51570}Amen.
{51657}{51690}Let's eat.
{51803}{51871}Hark ye gentles! Hark ye all.
{51877}{51941}Time has come for curtain call.
{52065}{52109}{y:i}How do you wear your hair|{y:i}Does your hair hang low
{52133}{52191}{y:i}Do you tie it in a ribbon|{y:i}Do you tie it in a bow
{52196}{52313}{y:i}Do you wear it over your shoulder|{y:i}Like a Continental soldier....
{52978}{53032}Are you an Aquarius?
{53277}{53311}Pisces?
{53578}{53621}I guessed right.
{53748}{53796}Do you like our place here?
{54802}{54836}Who sent you?
{55542}{55600}I got to get out of here, man.
{55628}{55691}We got things we want to do, man.
{55713}{55756}I got to get out of here, man.
{55805}{55917}Could you take me and my friend|over across the canyon?
{55922}{55961}Yeah, anything.
{55978}{56042}It won't be out of|your way, honest.
{56048}{56081}It's all right.
{56111}{56141}It's all right.
{56205}{56252}We're not no traveling bureau.
{56258}{56311}Why don't they get their own ride?
{56327}{56371}We're eating their food.
{56483}{56512}All right, man.
{56728}{56791}-Get them together though, man.|-Right.
{61243}{61326}When you get to the right place,|with the right people...
{61333}{61372}...quarter this.
{61415}{61476}You know, this could be|the right place.
{61505}{61551}Your time's running out.
{61558}{61588}Hey, man!
{61615}{61681}If we're going, we're going.|Let's go!
{61897}{61941}I'm hip about time.
{62023}{62057}But I just got to go.
{63667}{63760}Parading without a permit?|Do you know who this is, man?
{63766}{63862}This is Captain America. I'm Billy.|We're headliners, baby.
{63868}{63976}We played every fair in this part of|the country. For top dollar!
{64635}{64723}Weirdo hicks, man.|A bunch of weirdo hicks.
{64765}{64841}Parading without a permit, man!
{65429}{65487}Oh, no!|What did I do now?
{65595}{65662}Oh, what am I going to do now?
{65738}{65786}Oh, my head!
{65862}{65933}All right, George.|What're you going to do now?
{65938}{66002}You promised these people, now.
{66018}{66111}You promised these people|and you promised these people....
{66198}{66231}Hey, would you mind?
{66237}{66281}You just woke my friend up.
{66371}{66451}I'm real sorry.|I didn't realize l....
{66483}{66531}I didn't realize.
{66665}{66706}My head.
{66737}{66826}If you don't shut your mouth,|you won't have a head!
{67253}{67361}I see you're up, Mr. Hansen.|You'll feel a lot better after this.
{67461}{67501}Thank you, Bob.
{67593}{67676}I guess I really|tied one on last night.
{67682}{67746}Must've had a hell of a good time.
{67766}{67816}I wish I could remember it.
{67941}{67994}Could you get me a cigarette?
{68000}{68097}You animals ain't smart enough|to play with fire.
{68103}{68181}They're good boys.|You can give them a cigarette.
{68258}{68296}Thanks, mister.
{68378}{68416}Got a match?
{68483}{68526}Thank you, Bob.
{68713}{68804}I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.
{68810}{68933}There was no misunderstanding.|We're all in the same cage here.
{68997}{69077}You must be some important dude.|That treatment--
{69082}{69112}" Dude"?
{69136}{69206}What does he mean, "dude"?|Dude ranch?
{69288}{69378}" Dude" means a nice guy, you know?
{69393}{69439}" Dude" means a regular person.
{69451}{69543}You don't look like you're from|this part of the country.
{69549}{69644}You're lucky I'm here to see|you don't get into anything.
{69656}{69684}Well...
{69701}{69759}...they got this here...
{69773}{69848}...scissor-happy,|beautify-America thing here.
{69854}{69926}Trying to make everybody|look like Yul Brynner.
{69943}{70045}They used rusty razor blades|on the last two longhairs...
{70050}{70125}...they brought in.|I wasn't here to protect them.
{70131}{70160}See...
{70221}{70255}...l'm a lawyer.
{70261}{70320}Done a lot of work for the ACLU.
{70326}{70364}George Hansen.
{70436}{70517}You think you can help us|get out of here?
{70546}{70644}I imagine that I can|if you haven't killed anybody.
{70668}{70724}At least nobody white.
{70829}{70909}See there? $25.|Not too bad for no razor blades.
{70915}{70938}You know?
{70944}{71007}-Very groovy. Thank you.|-Very groovy.
{71013}{71084}See? I'll bet nobody ever|said that to you.
{71090}{71164}By the way, thanks|for the aspirin before.
{71170}{71209}I'm getting to....
{71216}{71304}I'm getting to think you're|a regular " regular" here.
{71310}{71364}I'm not going to tell your dad.
{71370}{71425}You just got to be more careful.
{71431}{71551}That'd be good if the powers that be|wouldn't hear about this.
{71565}{71650}The old man's not feeling good.|Know what I mean?
{71655}{71768}Well, now, George, we won't tell|your dad about that.
{71788}{71843}-Isn't that right?|-That's right.
{71884}{71997}What do you say we look at these super|machines we been hearing about?
{72003}{72044}Let's get it on.
{72051}{72129}Thanks a lot, Bob.|See you later.
{72255}{72324}I'll take care of it.|Don't worry about it.
{72376}{72410}All right, Carl.
{72416}{72489}Thanks a million.|Say hello to the missus.
{72581}{72654}Here's to the first|of the day, fellas.
{72705}{72769}To old D.H. Lawrence.
{73058}{73104}Indians!
{73366}{73394}Thank you.
{73436}{73464}You know...
{73496}{73609}...l must've started off to Mardi Gras|six or seven times.
{73634}{73699}Never got further than the state line.
{73741}{73814}The governor of Louisiana|gave me this.
{73835}{73894}" Madame Tinkertoy's|House of Blue Lights.
{73899}{73977}Bourbon and Toulouse,|New Orleans, Louisiana."
{73983}{74097}Now this is supposed to be|the finest whorehouse in the South.
{74116}{74223}These ain't no pork chops.|These are U.S. prime.
{74229}{74265}Out of sight, man!
{74271}{74334}Oh, I'd like to get over there.
{74374}{74485}How long did you boys say|it would take you to get down there?
{74491}{74553}-Two or three days.|-Two or three days?
{74558}{74595}Is that right?
{74618}{74699}Boy, I sure wish|I was going with you.
{74751}{74784}You got a helmet?
{74866}{74973}Oh, I've got a helmet!|I got a beauty!
{78597}{78707}Well, old buddy, I never thought|I'd ever see you again.
{78746}{78827}You know, I threw this thing away|one week ago.
{78851}{78946}My mother, of all people, retrieved it.|I can't understand.
{78952}{79072}She didn't want me to play football.|Always afraid I'd get hurt.
{79078}{79157}And here, 1 2 years later,|I find it on my pillow...
{79162}{79282}...with a note pinned next to it|saying, "Save this for your son."
{79469}{79493}Fire!
{79553}{79590}Do this instead.
{79639}{79722}No, thanks. I got some|store-bought here of my own.
{79728}{79797}No, man. This is grass.
{79818}{79881}You mean, marijuana?
{79991}{80067}Lord have mercy!|ls that what that is?
{80169}{80217}Let me see that.
{80463}{80492}Go ahead. Light it up.
{80504}{80552}Oh, no, no, no...
{80558}{80657}...l couldn't do that.|I've got enough problems...
{80662}{80756}...with the booze and all.|I can't afford to get hooked.
{80819}{80858}You won't get hooked.
{80864}{80972}Well, I know.|But it leads to harder stuff.
{81174}{81231}You say it's all right?
{81374}{81477}Well, all right then.|How do I do it?
{81499}{81522}Here.
{82049}{82112}That's got a real nice taste to it.
{82132}{82210}Though I don't suppose it'll|do me much good.
{82215}{82254}I'm so used to the booze.
{82273}{82362}You've got to hold it|in your lungs longer.
{82681}{82707}What...
{82713}{82810}...was that, man?|What the hell was that?
{82856}{82938}I don't know, man.|I was watching this object...
{82943}{82988}...like the satellite we saw.
{82994}{83072}And it went right across the sky.|And then....
{83087}{83138}I mean, it just suddenly....
{83149}{83266}It just changed direction and went|whizzing off. It flashed and--
{83271}{83328}You're stoned out of your mind.
{83334}{83446}Oh, yeah. I'm stoned, man.|But, like, I saw a satellite.
{83457}{83572}And it was going across the sky,|and it flashed three times at me...
{83578}{83633}...and zigzagged and whizzed off.
{83649}{83687}And I saw it.
{83732}{83837}That was a UFO beaming back at you.
{83862}{83947}Me and Eric Heisman|was down in Mexico two weeks ago.
{83953}{84035}We seen 40 of them|flying in formation.
{84041}{84122}They've got bases|all over the world now.
{84127}{84196}They've been coming here|ever since 1 946...
{84201}{84307}...when scientists started|bouncing radar beams off the moon.
{84313}{84407}And they've been living|and working among us ever since.
{84413}{84475}The government knows all about them.
{84488}{84534}What are you talking, man?
{84554}{84616}You just seen one of them,|didn't you?
{84622}{84727}I saw something, but I didn't|see it working here.
{84749}{84818}Well, they are people,|just like us...
{84824}{84883}...from within our own solar system.
{84888}{84973}Except that their society is|more highly evolved.
{84979}{85067}They don't have no wars.|They got no monetary system.
{85072}{85173}They don't have any leaders,|because each man is a leader.
{85179}{85253}Because of their technology...
{85259}{85367}...they're able to feed, clothe, house|and transport themselves...
{85372}{85437}...equally and with no effort.
{85694}{85785}You know something?|You want to know what I think?
{85791}{85893}I think this is a crackpot idea.|That's what I think.
{85899}{85961}How about that?
{85967}{86037}Think it's a crackpot idea.
{86063}{86149}If they're so smart,|why don't they reveal themselves...
{86154}{86193}...and get it over with?
{86199}{86298}Why don't they reveal themselves|is because if they did...
{86304}{86353}...it'd cause a general panic.
{86359}{86422}Now, we still have leaders...
{86428}{86515}...upon whom we rely|to release this information.
{86522}{86638}These leaders have decided|to repress this information...
{86644}{86693}...because of the shock...
{86698}{86791}...that it would cause|to our antiquated systems.
{86796}{86913}Now, the result of this has been|that the Venusians...
{86918}{87018}...have contacted people|at all walks of life...
{87023}{87072}...all walks of life....
{87469}{87588}It would be a devastating blow to|our antiquated systems.
{87594}{87703}Now Venusians are meeting with people|in all walks of life...
{87709}{87761}...in an advisory capacity.
{87772}{87847}For once, man will have|a godlike control...
{87853}{87967}...over his own destiny.|He'll have a chance to transcend...
{87973}{88060}...and to evolve|with some equality for all.
{88252}{88297}How's your joint, George?
{88431}{88483}I believe it went out.
{88489}{88602}I got to talking so much,|I clean forgot about....
{88634}{88677}It went out.
{88874}{88948}Save it and we'll do it|tomorrow morning.
{88954}{89027}It gives you a new way|of looking at the day.
{89084}{89152}Well, I sure could use that.
{89176}{89261}I sure could use a little of that.
{93500}{93571}What the hell is this?|Troublemakers?
{93608}{93676}You name it,|I'll throw rocks at it, Sheriff.
{93685}{93771}Y'all, check what just walked in.
{93791}{93862}I like the one in the red shirt|with suspenders.
{93867}{93897}White shirt for me.
{93903}{93969}I like something|with black pants on.
{94042}{94092}-What did you say?|-I said--
{94121}{94142}What?
{94248}{94309}I can't believe.|What are they doing here?
{94314}{94403}-Look at the teeth around his neck.|-Did they drive motorcycles?
{94408}{94458}They know we're talking about them.
{94500}{94536}Hot damn!
{94543}{94567}I'll tell you.
{94572}{94671}I'll order kidneys, because|I left mine out on the road somewhere.
{94712}{94801}-I like his hair all down his head.|-And I like his eyes.
{94807}{94868}You know that girl over there|in the corner?
{94910}{95001}Don't look too close because|the sheriff's right over there.
{95007}{95038}You know what I mean?
{95043}{95117}-Check that joker with long hair.|-I checked him.
{95123}{95206}We might have to bring him|to the Hilton before it's over.
{95212}{95267}-I think she's cute.|-Isn't she though?
{95273}{95321}We'll put him in a woman's cell.
{95326}{95424}We ought to put them in a cage|and charge admission to see them.
{95453}{95540}Those are what are known as|country witticisms.
{95545}{95590}I can't believe they're here.
{95595}{95654}Let's ask them to take us for a ride.
{95659}{95691}Don't be foolish!
{95696}{95766}They'll think you--|He'll laugh in your face.
{95771}{95840}-Yeah, that'd be good.|-I doubt it.
{95845}{95896}-I'm going to ask them.|-Be my guest.
{95902}{95952}Not when I'm around.
{95958}{95999}I don't think you're going to.
{96005}{96036}Go ahead.
{96126}{96191}I thought at first|that bunch over there...
{96196}{96262}...their mothers were|frightened by gorillas...
{96268}{96317}...but now I think they were caught.
{96322}{96371}I think one's Alley Oop...
{96376}{96412}...from the beads on him.
{96418}{96471}One of them darn sure is not Oola.
{96476}{96576}Look like a bunch of refugees|from a gorilla love-in.
{96590}{96667}-A gorilla couldn't love that.|-Nor could a mother.
{96674}{96776}I wish you could mate him up|with one of those black wenches.
{96782}{96836}Oh, now, I don't know about that.
{96842}{96911}And that's about as low as they come.
{96917}{96941}He's a biggie.
{96947}{96976}And they're green.
{96981}{97059}-No, they're not green, they're white.|-White?
{97071}{97133}You're colour-blind.|I just got to say that.
{97139}{97177}Sure like to get some food.
{97182}{97296}I thought jails were built for|humanity, and that won't quite qualify.
{97301}{97421}-Wonder where they got those wigs.|-They probably grew them.
{97426}{97492}-Nothing else would grow on them.|-You know...
{97497}{97566}...l'm not real hungry at the moment.
{97594}{97625}You know what I mean?
{97646}{97721}I saw two of them one time|just kissing away.
{97727}{97757}Two males. Think of it!
{97846}{97888}What should we do with them?
{97898}{97988}I don't know, but I don't think|they'll make the parish line.
{98110}{98145}Let's split.
{98150}{98179}Split?
{98338}{98361}Yes, sir.
{98367}{98431}It certainly has been nice.
{98588}{98657}They got fancy bikes.|That's some Yankee queers.
{98662}{98716}Check the flag on that bike.
{98733}{98771}It sure is.
{98789}{98871}I still say they're not going to|make the parish line.
{98998}{99049}Hey, can I have a ride?
{99054}{99089}You want a ride?
{99116}{99166}You got a note from your moms?
{99171}{99216}Oh, our mothers won't mind.
{99222}{99276}Please let us have a ride.
{99313}{99361}I don't mind giving you a ride.
{99416}{99476}{y:i}The man is at the window
{99567}{99624}{y:i}The man is at the window!
{99630}{99690}I'd love to take|you girls for a ride.
{100516}{100547}You know...
{100565}{100639}...this used to be|a hell of a good country.
{100662}{100744}I can't understand|what's gone wrong with it.
{100829}{100880}Everybody got chicken, that's what.
{100886}{100963}We can't even get into|a second-rate hotel.
{100968}{101037}I mean, a second-rate motel, you dig?
{101043}{101130}They think we'd cut their throat.|They're scared.
{101135}{101180}They're not scared of you.
{101186}{101260}They're scared of|what you represent to them.
{101265}{101377}All we represent to them|is somebody who needs a haircut.
{101383}{101410}Oh, no.
{101423}{101469}What you represent to them...
{101474}{101504}...is freedom.
{101509}{101561}Freedom's what it's all about.
{101567}{101640}Oh yeah, that's right.|That's what it's all about.
{101646}{101700}But talking about it and being it...
{101706}{101756}...that's two different things.
{101778}{101820}It's real hard to be free...
{101825}{101909}...when you are bought and sold|in the marketplace.
{101970}{102074}Don't tell anybody that they're not|free, because they'll get busy...
{102079}{102169}...killing and maiming|to prove to you that they are.
{102175}{102253}They're going to talk to you|and talk to you...
{102259}{102322}...about individual freedom.
{102331}{102439}But they see a free individual,|it's going to scare them.
{102455}{102519}Well, it don't make them|running scared.
{102575}{102629}It makes them dangerous.
{102868}{102904}Swamp.
{103086}{103119}Swamp.
{103304}{103349}Do you ever....
{103360}{103454}You ever talk to bullfrogs|in the middle of the night?
{103461}{103499}Not generally.
{103518}{103549}-You don't?|-No, man.
{103555}{103614}You know what I used to do?
{103641}{103687}What did you used to do?
{103693}{103744}One thing I didn't used to do...
{103750}{103849}...is talk to bullfrogs|in the middle of the night, foolish.
{103855}{103884}You're out of your mind!
{103898}{103934}That's right.
{106290}{106334}Oh, God.
{106451}{106514}What are we going to do|with his stuff, man?
{106576}{106629}Get it to his folks somehow.
{106766}{106809}There's not much here, man.
{106814}{106919}There's some money,|and there's his driver's license.
{106926}{106993}Here's his card, man.
{107029}{107079}He ain't going to be using that.
{107821}{107885}We'll go there for|just one drink, man.
{108404}{108485}No man, now really.|He would've wanted us to, man.
{109937}{110052}" If God did not exist,|it would be necessary to invent Him."
{110121}{110165}That's a humdinger.
{110270}{110325}I'm getting a little smashed, man.
{110331}{110370}A little smashed.
{110789}{110845}Wow, it's hot in here, man.
{110974}{111015}Chicks, man.
{111114}{111180}Look at those chicks, man.

{113287}{113383}-What are these things?|-What are these things, huh?
{113388}{113427}I'm kind of a freak myself.
{113451}{113521}I never really thought|of myself as a freak.

Forget it, forget it.
Your name is.. how should i call you?
Xiao Shao Zi
Oh, Brother Xiao.
What do you do for living?
I'm a lazy guy!
If someone feeds me ,
I stay and help out for a while but not for too long.
Forgive my rudeness but what's the purpose of your trip.
Oh, the boss here, Mr.Wu is my friend.
What do you do ?
I'm working for the Justice Department.
I fool around all day 
 with these monkeys!
So you come here for some case .. right?
No choice, i take the money, so must do the job!
Maybe in the future I will need your help
You're too kind.
So what case are you working on now?
Brother Xiao, please don't take it personally,
But my profession doesn't allow me to speak too much.
I understand
We came from the capital by the secret 
Imperial Order.
The commander told us to keep people away from the crime scene
I understand, you mean I should leave now.
No i can't let you do that, but if you help me out i will every grateful
Heh, no need for that.
I can pay for your traveling expenses.
Don't mention it
But if Mr Wu comes back  
I will visit again
Sure, sure!
Thanks.
Boss,boss..... yes
How much?
Forget it, just forget it
Sir, I can.....
I appreciate it
See you then.
Yes.. see you.
Please give this to that guy.
Bye.
Bye.
Send two guys to follow him.
Big Brother
Shao Zi!
You are here finally.
I've been your place already.
Why didn't you wait for me?
There's a Royal Officer\ with a special assignment, hes says.
He told me I should better leave.
What?
I don't believe him, also his followers have no uniform.
Wait a moment.
Who do you think they are?
They seem to be cruel, and they know how to fight.
Why did you ask me to come?
Let's go back to the inn.
Sir, Xiao is coming back.
Hide it.
Careful how you talk to me.
We're not from the Agency, but the Justice Department.
Go tell the others, and hurry!
Go tell the guard!
Yes, Sir.
Oh, what a pleasant surprise!
Xiao, you're back so soon?
As soon as I left,
 I met Brother Wu outside.
This is the Officer from the Justice Department.
Wu Ming.
Innkeeper Wu Ming!
Please excuse me if my men didn't serve you well enough.
No, no, it was all very good.
Mr. Wu.
I am Mao Zong Xian, we have some business to attend here.
You just serve us here,with all we need, nothing else please.
Until we have finished our job, nobody is allowed to leave here.
Is that clear?
And no new guests without our approval!
Yes...
Stop there!
What do you want?
Run!
Wait, Big Brother.
Let's follow them quietly.
See? Let's go to the inn.
What is it?
We want a room.
Open up!
Open the door!
No vacant rooms, sorry.
Who's the boss here?
It's me.
Why don't you open the door?
My men have no manners, but we're full indeed.
Then we'll sleep on the floor!
You can't do that!
Stop! Why use violence?
So what?
I am asking you.
None of your business...
The hard way, eh?
Stop it, Big Brother!
We will sleep here!
No need to sleep on the floor,
 you can have my room.
No way we can accept that.
We have to help each other.
And who is that?
A businessman.
Boss, let's eat now!
Have a good meal.
Now tell us... why are you in this desert area?
We want to get to Guangzhou,
 meet some relatives.
And what is your business here?
Justice Department sent us to catch two escaped criminals.
Yes, it's a hard job indeed.
To Your health!
Have you seen a group escorting convicts?
A man, a woman and a kid.
We've seen a few escorts.
Maybe you know their names and destination?
Their name is Xiang, they are far relatives of us.
No idea...and you?
I've seen nothing.
Cheers!
The wine is no good.
Go see if you can get some of the good wine.
Wine is poisoned.
Let me be excused for my behaviour
I toast a wine herefore to you.
Good, let's forget what happened.
Cheers!
Thank you.
Wine is poisoned.
Hot wine.
To our health!
Cheers!
Look out!
You drank too much!
Me?
Big Brother, you're drunk.
No worries, who spills wine gets new one!
To your health!
Brother...
You oughta stop drinking.
Better eat something, or else you will starve to death...
I won't starve!
Mother told me to look after you not to drink too much!
Wine is very strong, it has deaf muck inside!
I am not allowed to drink, sorry!
Why don't you drink then with us?
Sure!
You spilt to much, let me.
Here, take my cup.
Mine is spilt too, give me your cup, please.
Why want mine? 
It doesn't matter at all.
It does matter to me!
What's the matter with you! 
Pour again.
I want your cup!
What's so special with my cup?
If you keep talking like that, you will have trouble!
You be still!
Enough. Give him your cup.
You stay out of it, Brother.
That's no way to drink wine.
Stop it!
Sorry, but my man is drunk.
Officer Mao, he almost got me killed!
Stop it! We know your skills already!
I think they have something to do with the beheaded Yu Qian.
I think Xiao is the most dangerous.
He told the two the wine is poisoned.
When?
When he cheered the wine to you.
How did he do it?
No idea.
But they are all connected somehow.
Four?
The innkeeper too.
Then they must all die.
Xiao is a dangerous guy.
We will play a trick on them.
I don't like this Xiao.
If not for him we would be dead by now.
Why should he save us?
You sleep over there tonight.
On the floor?
You got some trick again, eh?
We should start.
 - Yes.
Let me tell you what happened!
Don't act rashly!
A woman!
What's the matter?
Officer Mao, did you hear some noise?
No.
Come to my room.
- Yes.
Who is it?
The innkeeper.
Oh, it's you.
What happened here?
No idea.
I have an idea.
Boss, if you have to say something, just do it!
How dare you talk to me like that?
Only talking crap and fighting. 
Without your sister you would be long dead.
But you will learn some day.
- You! - Stop it!
- How dare you...
Wanna fight again?
He is a bit tempered.
He was tampered as a child.
Hasn't changed a bit till today.
You know my brother?
Yes. 
No wonder he doesn't recognize me.
Last time he saw me he was a kid.
Who are you?
Wu Ming.
You're the officer from Yu Qians troupe?
Your father and I were in the same unit.
Uncle Wu!
Years have flown by...
Stand up. 
Come to my room later.
Brother Wu, how did you know they're from the Agency?
I know these people.
They're here because of Yu's family, I'm sure.
Uncle Wu, what shall we do now?
Wait till they are asleep, then kill them all.
Yu's family will be here tomorrow.
At dawn we go out to look for them outside.
After we got them, we kill the agents.
They may look for them too...
We have to risk it.
We will search in different directions.
Gotta vanish very quietly from here.
Search him.
It's the East Agency.
"Kill the Yu family"
If something happens,
 send someone after me.
When they get us, I will...
Be careful. 
- Sure.
Lao San, they're here!
Watch it! 
Go tell the others now.
Any vacant rooms for us?
- Rooms? - Yes.
- Yes, we have some.
Get us something to eat.
Bring some water and tea.
And get the food.
Hurry.
Sit down.
Here, some water.
How long will you stay?
We will leave tomorrow morning.
That's good.
Go.
They seem to be here.
Go back and save them now.
If it's too late,
 take them to the grain storage.
I will find Xiao.
Hey, this way!
We must leave now!
What's going on?
Quickly, we must leave.
Attack!
To the grain storage!
You can't get away!
Get them.
Go to the grain storage.
And you attack from front.
Make room. just forget it.
Ok. If you let Yu's family go.
Oh. Well, ok.
You go inside.
Bring Yu here.
I will take care of this man here.
Miss Yu!
Get to the grain storage and try to get inside from behind it.
And you?
I will hold them here.
Brother Xiao! 
- Yes?
Mr. Xiao.
Who is it?
Pi Shao Tang. 
Would you step outside?
Why're you calling for me?
Xiao, look there.
You called me to show me this?
I don't think my men deserved this.
You think so? 
They should have learned their lessons now.
You're no Yu relative.
Why do you fight so hard?
I have no choice. 
I get paid too, after all.
If that's the case, money's no issue.
Once I took a side, there is no turning back.
But why? You can change sides.
Sorry, but that is impossible.
Why?
It's not about honour and money.
It's about the family of a great man.
And also...don't be angry...
Your agents don't have the best popularity.
Don't try to flatter me.
 I know this all myself.
But we pay our men very well.
What does "good" mean?
It depends on the service done to us.
I believe you saw what service I can provide.
Then you may accept an offer?
Maybe...
We usually pay 100 Taels.
 I offer double.
That's not enough.
Xiao, name a price!
200 pieces of gold!
Ok, I will pay 200 in gold.
Payment right now.
Now you're going too far!
What is this?
Want to rip me off?
Hold him.
Get aside.
If you keep disturbing me I'll get angry!
Get them away from here!
You need some rest.
Wasting medicine for him.
Be quiet!
He'll be alright.
Let him go.
You may leave now.
Don't let them go!
Be still now.
They'll be back for us!
Shut up!
Just leave now.
Go on.
Thank you.
But what can we say...
Don't drink too much water.
Leave now!
They're unconscious.
Mr. Wu, may I talk to you?
Don't listen to him!
Enough now.
Go on.
Mr. Wu
We don't want to go back.
And why is that?
If you don't mind... we want to follow you.
You won't have a bright future with us.
If we go back, we won't have one, too.
Doing evil deeds every day, killing innocent people.
Sooner or later, we'll regret it anyway.
What's your name?
Duo La.
What?
My name's Duo La. We're Tartars.
He's my brother.
We always admired 
Chinese culture when we were home.
I always wanted to go to China.
When I was 18, 
General Yu assembled new troops.
And so me marched the way to China.
Who would have thought...
So you know me.
Who doesn't know Lt. Wu from General Yu's Army?
How come you work for the Agency?
Just shortly before General Yu was convicted...
I was transferred to Royal Guard.
After the execution I honored Yu's grave.
Zhao heard of this and transferred us to East Agency.
We had no choice.
And so you became agents.
Can you tell them to leave for a moment?
Zhao Shao Shin had me and my brother... sterilized...
I assume they won't be here these 2 days.
You said Zhao had his fighting skills heightened.
What do you mean by that?
I don't know. 
They just say, his skill is unmatched...
He has asthma and mustn't overdo it.
Xiao, let's get him.
You think that's enough?
He's even faster than us two.
Really?
Then show us your skill.
They're coming!
Open up!
Who is it?
Wu Ming, it's Gui Yu Xiang!
Lt. Gui, be welcome!
Hello.
You can come out. He's a friend.
Go on.
Where are my 12 guards?
The agency men killed them.
So? And why did they do it?
They wanted to kill Yu's children,
 and your men were in the way.
Wu Ming, we're friends... but don't act so rashly!
- Arrest him! 
- Lt. Lui! - We'll talk later.
Out of the way!
You want to resist? Drop your weapon!
I bow to your Excellency.
You're to blame for all this.
I have failed, but Xiao's too good a fighter.
Weakling! Just look at yourself.
 Dress up!
Yes.
Stop!
I heard that the innkeeper's name is Wu.
Yes.
Is it Wu Ming?
The children of Yu must die. 
Everyone helping them will be killed too.
He must be around here.
Damn eunuch. I will talk to him.
You're to watch the border.
This is not your business.
Just stay out of it or you'll be in trouble.
This is my territory. 
East Agency enuchs don't have to interfere here!
How dare you!
A low-ranking officer like you speaking like that to me? You're dismissed!
Good.
Show me the Royal Order.
Bring me the order and show it to him.
Your Excellency, look at this
Step aside!
I can't see you now. 
Take care of your health. Wu Ming.
They're good for our escape.
Let me.
Stay here!
Duo La!
Cover me.
Go back and tell Your 
Excellency we've got them.
He's wounded. Let's finish him.
Traitors!
You cover our backs, we go up front!
They got us surrounded. 
There's no way out.
Zhao and his men are in supremacy. 
We must fight now.
What about the others?
You stay here.
We will try to get to Zhao.
I'll go with you, help may be needed in the fight.
No, you better watch them.
You know you'll be in great danger.
If I'm not back by dawn, try to get away with the others.
Tell me where Zhao is and you'll live.
Where is Zhao? Talk!
Talk!
He is...there!
You will go to Zhao and tell him I want to speak to him.
Go!
Is that so? 
And where are they now?
Out there.
Tell them to come in.
Yes, Sir.
On order of Your Excellence Zhao, 
Xiao shall enter the house!
On order of Your Excellence Zhao, 
Xiao shall enter the house!
No stupid formalities! 
Tell him to come out now!
His Excellence.
Who is Xiao?
That's me.
You're very impudent.
I have to be.
I heard you're a good fighter.
It's enough.
You don't look a bit like it.
You don't look like an eunuch, either.
How dare you!
Don't try to scare me. 
I'm not one of your agents!
I'll make you an offer. 
Just leave the kids here... then you may leave freely from here.
If you follow me, 
I'll give you the post of an officer.
What if not?
Then you will suffer.
Old man, you're good!
This technique is learned from childhood on.
And never to taste the senses of joy!
But that's no  problem for you; you never had senses to enjoy
Am I right?
Take a few men and search for the Kids.
Now that was close! 
So close I nearly became the same as you!
Get back!
Eunuch Zhao, as you don't have anything below, take better care of the upper half!
You're too old for such stuff!
[MUSIC - "HOORAY FOR SANTA
CLAUS"]
NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): At this time,
Station KID-TV brings you the special event of the year, a first in television history.
At this very moment,
KID-TV has standing by a television crew at
Santa Claus' workshop.
And in just a few seconds, our special correspondent,
Andy Henderson, will bring you a person to person interview with Santa Claus himself, direct from the North Pole, where at the moment, the temperature is 91 degrees below zero.
And now KID-TV takes you via Telstar,
Andy Henderson at the North Pole.
ANDY HENDERSON
(ON TV): Hi, kids.
This is Andy Henderson at the North Pole.
Whoo, it's cold up here.
From this spot, there's only one direction you can go, and that's south.
Living up here is pretty rough.
I don't see how Santa stands it.
Since we've been here, we've eaten nothing but frozen food.
At least, that's the way it is by the time we get it.
And now, let's take a looksee into Santa's workshop.
Hello again.
Boys and girls, it's just weeks before Christmas, and Santa and his helpers are working overtime to make sure that there's enough toys for the kids all over the world.
Santa's a pretty busy man, but I'm sure he'd like to say a few words to you kids.
Hello, Santa.
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, hello, son.
Oh, well, hello boys and girls.
Hey... oh, Andy, you caught me at a very busy time.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, uh, you think you'll be ready by Christmas Eve?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, we've never disappointed the kids yet.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Tell me, is it true that this year, there's a rumor that you're going to use a rocket sled?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): No sir-ee.
We're going out the good old fashioned way, with my reindeer... Prancer and
Dancer, and Donner and Blitzen, and Vixen and
Nixon... hey, Nixon?
Oh, where'd I get... Oh,
I always... confound it.
I get those names mixed up.
But the kids know their names.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Santa, there you are.
We have so much to do, and you stand here dawdling, talking to this visitor.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Mr.
Anderson, this is Mrs. Claus.
Uh, well, dear, we're on television.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV): How do you do, Mr. Anderson.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ma'am.
MRS. CLAUS (ON TV):
Now, I want you to go and finish painting those hobby horses.
Television?
Did you say we're on television?
Oh, oh dear.
Oh, why didn't you tell me?
Oh, my hair's a mess.
Mm-mm... H-hello there.
Oh, oh!
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Come along, Mr. Anderson, and I'll show you some of the new toys we're turning out.
How's it going, Winky?
WINKY (ON TV): Everything is A-OK, Santa.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Good man.
Winky is in charge of our space department.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Ah.
SANTA CLAUS (ON
TV): Oh, now here, here is the latest toy rocket.
It runs on real rocket fuel.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Really?
I've been wondering, what is this strange little creature over here?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Oh, uh, Winky made that.
That's his idea of a Martian.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): A Martian?
Wow-ee-wow, I'd hate to meet a creature like that on a dark night.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh-ho-ho.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): I wonder if there really are people on Mars.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
Well, who knows.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON
TV): Well, if there are, I hope they have someone like you up there, Santa, to bring joy and good cheer to all the Martian children.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): Oh,
Mr. Anders... Ho-ho-ho.
Well, keep going, Winky.
Christmas Eve is coming soon.
Now Mr. Anderson, I want to show you some more things.
Now you...
Dropo?
Dropo, you lazy, good-for-nothing, where are you?
Dropo, Dropo, wake up.
Wake up.
[LAUGHING]
Oh, please turn off that tickle ray.
KIMAR: Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up.
Stand up.
I'm sorry, Ki... Kimar, sir.
Dropo, you are the laziest man on Mars.
Why are you sleeping during working hours?
I wasn't sleeping, Chief.
It's just that I haven't been able to sleep these last few nights.
I forgot how.
So I was just practicing.
Well I suggest you practice doing your work.
Where's Lady Momar?
Oh, she went to the food pill center to get some new food pills.
The children haven't been eating well.
No appetite at all.
Oh, it's no wonder.
They sit in front of the video set all day, watching those ridiculous
Earth programs.
It confuses them.
Where are they?
Oh, in there watching
Earth programs.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Say,
Santa, what have we here?
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV):
These are new dolls.
Now, this little doll walks, talks, cries, and she even sings.
ANDY HENDERSON (ON TV): Almost like a real, live little girl.
SANTA CLAUS (ON TV): That she is sir, that she is.
All she needs is tender loving care.
Bomar, what is a doll?
I don't know, Girmar.
What is tender loving care?
I don't know, either.
Bomar, Girmar, I told you not to watch those silly Earth programs.
Now go to sleep.
Must we go to sleep now, Father?
I want to see Santa
Claus some more.
I want to see more toys.
No.
Go to sleep.
Hello, Dropo.
I see you're keeping busy.
Oh, I've been working very hard, Lady Momar.
I've been vacuuming the room.
Good.
Is the master here?
Oh, he's in there.
And Kimar is very angry, too.
Kimar, I bought some new food pills.
I hope the children will eat these.
We have hamburger, buttered asparagus, mashed potatoes, and a special treat for them, chocolate layer cake pills.
Momar, I'm worried about our children.
So am I. They've hardly eaten a thing in three days.
It goes deeper than that.
They're behaving strangely.
They appear to be troubled.
They don't care to sleep.
I had to use the sleep spray on them again.
I mentioned this to my council chiefs today, and I learned it's the same with children all around the planet, in every district.
Something is happening to the children of Mars.
Kimar, as the leader of the Martians, you must do something about it.
I know, but what?
Why don't you go to the forest and see
Chochem, the ancient one.
He'll know what to do.
He's never failed you.
You speak wisely.
I will go.
Attention, council chiefs.
Please report.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Lomas reporting.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Rigna reporting.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Hargo here.
Voldar?
Voldar, please report.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON
INTERCOM): Voldar reporting.
Gentlemen of the council, we will meet immediately at Chochum's Chair in Thunder Forest.
COUNCIL CHIEF (ON INTERCOM):
What's wrong now, Kimar?
I don't know, Voldar.
But I mean to find out.
Where's Kimar?
He should be here any moment.
What's this all about?
We'll find out when Kimar arrives.
We are probably going to seek the advice of Chochum.
What does Kimar think we are, a kindergarten class?
Can't we make our own decisions?
Must we always come crawling to that [INAUDIBLE] old man?
Chochum is 800 years old.
You can't dismiss the wisdom of centuries.
I can.
Gentlemen.
Thank you for coming.
Chochum?
Chochum, are you here?
Ancient One of Mars,
I call upon you.
Chochum, it is I, Kimar, and the council chiefs.
We need you, Chochum.
You called me, Kimar?
We need your advice, Chochum.
Something is wrong with our children.
They eat not.
They sleep not.
Their only interest is watching meaningless Earth programs on the video.
Wh-wh-what time of year is it now?
KIMAR: It is the middle of Septober.
No, no.
Not here.
I mean on Earth.
Ah, yes.
It is early December on Earth.
Close to the time of the Christmas.
That explains it.
What is a Christmas?
It is an occasion for great joy and peace on the planet Earth.
And for children, it is also a time of anticipation, as they await the arrival of
Santa Claus and his gifts.
Bah, what nonsense.
What has this to do with our children, Ancient One?
We have no children on Mars.
They have children's bodies, but with adult minds.
They do not have a childhood.
I've seen this coming for centuries.
They are born.
Our electronic teaching machines are attached to their brains while they are in their cradles.
Information is fed into their minds in a constant stream.
And by the time they can walk, they are adults.
They've never played.
They've never learned to have fun.
And now, now they are rebelling.
What do you advise?
The children must be allowed to be children again.
They must learn to play.
They must learn what it means to have fun.
We need a Santa Claus on Mars.
Santa Claus on Mars?
Where will we get a Santa Claus?
There's only one Santa
Claus, and he's on Earth.
Well, I guess that takes care of that.
Didn't I tell you it was a foolish idea to seek advice from that old man?
This is a serious matter, Voldar.
And desperate problems require desperate deeds.
Earth has had Santa
Claus long enough.
We will bring him to Mars.
I'm against it.
Our children are fine the way they are.
I don't want any Santa Claus bringing them toys and games.
They'll start playing and laughing and running under foot.
They'll become a nuisance.
I've made my decision.
We leave for Earth tonight.
Rigna, Lomas, prepare spaceship number one.
Approaching projected Earth orbit.
Fire port side rockets number one and number two.
Port side rockets number one and number two, fired.
Entering Earth orbit.
All right, Voldar.
Now to find Santa Claus.
Turn on your magnascope to third power.
We're over a city of some kind.
So that's what the Earth people call a city, eh?
How primitive.
Look at all those buildings above ground.
Why, we could destroy that city with one blast of our Q-ray.
We've not come here to destroy anyone.
Our only purpose is to bring
Santa Claus back to Mars.
Turn to fifth power.
Let's see if we can locate Santa Claus.
He wears a red suit, trimmed with white fur, and he has a long white beard.
But there are millions of people down there.
It's like looking for a speck of space dust in a comet's tail.
Wait a minute.
I see him.
I see Santa Claus.
I see him, too.
He's standing on the corner, ringing a bell.
No he's not.
He's standing near the entrance of a large building, next to a large black kettle.
He's standing on the corner, Kimar.
He's... wait a minute.
I see another one.
Why, there are hundreds of
Santa Clauses down there.
Are we going to bring them all back with us to Mars?
Just one.
And with so many, they won't miss one.
Prepare for landing on next orbit.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON
TV): We interrupt our program with a special bulletin.
An unidentified object has been spotted in orbit around the Earth.
The Soviet Union denies it has launched any new space satellites.
Our radar stations are tracking the spaceship, or whatever it is.
The US Air Force has alerted all defense commands and retaliatory units.
Sir, Earth radar beams are bouncing off our ship.
Well, it certainly took them long enough.
Voldar, turn on the radar shield.
Dysfunctioning of radar shield.
Rigna, check the radar box.
Radar shield functioning.
What was wrong, Rigna?
A slight case of Dropo.
Oh, hi Chief.
What are you doing here, Dropo?
Oh, well, Chief, I went to the launching pad so I could say goodbye to you, and I remembered,
I've never been to Earth!
So I thought I wanted to see...
I may leave you there in place of Santa Claus.
Now get below.
I'll deal with you later.
Dropo, get below quickly.
Yes chief.
Yes.
Yes chief.
I'm sorry.
Prepare to land.
We'll set down in that field near the lake.
Rocket silencers set.
Rotor rockets number one and two, fire.
All this trouble over a fat little man in a red suit.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): Here is another UFO bulletin.
The Defense Department has just announced that the unidentified flying object has suddenly disappeared from our radar screen.
They believe the object has either disintegrated in space, or it may be a spaceship from some other planet, which has the ability to nullify our radar beams.
Because of the ominous situation, the president has ordered the Strategic
Air Command into action.
[HORN BUZZING]
NEWS ANCHOR (VOICEOVER):
The Defense Department believes that the object spotted on our radar screens might have been nothing more than a meteor which burned up when it entered our atmosphere.
Professor [INAUDIBLE] Von
Green, our leading space expert, is still convinced it was a Martian spaceship.
Stay tuned for further bulletins.
Billy, what does a
Martian look like?
I don't know.
Nobody's ever seen one.
I don't believe there are any Martians.
You don't, huh?
What would you do if a Martian walked right up behind you?
I'd scream.
[SCREAMS]
Ah, stop doing that.
I'm trying to sleep.
I see a Martian.
Boy, you and your imagination.
Come on, let's go home.
Who... who are you?
We're from Mars.
Don't be afraid.
We have children just like you on Mars.
What are those funny things sticking out of your head.
Those are our antenna.
Are you a television set?
Shh.
Stupid question.
Is this what you want to do to our children on Mars?
Turn them into nincompoops like these?
Hold your tongue, Voldar?
What's your name, little boy?
Billy.
Billy Foster, sir.
And this is my sister, Betty.
Well perhaps you can help us, Billy.
We're looking for one of your Santa Clauses.
There's only one Santa Claus.
We've seen many of them in your cities.
Oh.
Those are his helpers.
There's only one real Santa Claus.
And he's in his workshop up at the North Pole.
That's what we came here to find out.
Let's go.
Come on, you two.
Let me go!
Where are you taking us?
Leave them alone, Voldar!
What?
And leave them here to inform the authorities?
He's right, Kimar.
We'd better take them along with us to North Pole.
Very well.
Come along.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): This morning, two children disappeared mysteriously in the vicinity of Welsh Lake.
The police have found no clues.
And it seems as though
Billy and Betty Foster have simply vanished into thin air.
This appears to be a day when everything is vanishing into thin air.
While local police are continuing their search for the missing children, the armed forces are continuing their search for the mysterious object from space.
All right, Billy and Betty.
Nobody here.
Come on in.
Golly.
Now, I'm not supposed to bring you here.
The chief's going to be awful mad if he finds us.
Boy, wait 'til the kids at home find that I was in a real
Martian spaceship.
No... no, don't touch anything.
Now, here.
That's the anti-gravity generator.
And these are the retro rockets.
Does this light up?
Only when radar waves are bouncing off our ship.
Then we put up this radar screen.
Then nobody can find us in space.
Boy, that's pretty sharp.
Yep.
What's this, Dropo?
Oh, that's the elevator signal.
That light starts flashing when somebody's coming up from the navigation deck.
Oh... oh, oh.
BILLY: Somebody's coming up.
We better get out of here.
No, no, no!
There's no time for that.
Oh, oh, I'm in trouble.
Oh, no time.
Here.
Here, here.
Quick.
Thinking of taking another nap in the radar box, Dropo?
Oh, oh, no sir.
As a matter of fact, I was just looking in there to remind myself never to hide in there again.
I bet.
No.
Approaching North Pole.
I can see Santa Claus' workshop.
Prepare for landing.
Hargo, set the rocket silences.
Dropo?
You stay aboard and guard those children.
They must not leave the ship now.
Now, or never?
What do you mean, Voldar?
If we take them with us to Mars,
Santa's disappearance would remain a mystery.
No one on Earth will ever know that Santa
Claus was kidnapped by Martians.
Perhaps you're right.
Dropo?
Yes sir?
Get back to those children, and don't let them out of your sight.
Understand?
Yes, sir I understand.
I... I'll keep an eye.
We've landed.
Secure the ship.
Lomas, you remain on guard and have the ship ready for immediate blast off.
Rigna, Hargo, Voldar, you'll accompany me.
Come.
We'll activate Torg.
Torg?
To capture a roly poly little man like Santa Claus?
We don't need Torg.
We won't take any chances.
Come.
Nothing can stop Torg.
They're going to kidnap
Santa Claus, and us, too.
Not if we can help it.
We've got to get out of here and warn Santa.
What's a Torg?
I don't know, but
I'm not afraid of it.
It's not going to stop us.
Come on.
Wait, Betty.
BETTY: Why did you do that?
If this ship ever leaves Earth, we'll have the whole US
Space Force after them.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
Come on.
BILLY: Come on, Betty.
This action must take place swiftly.
We can't afford to make any mistakes.
Hargo, you cover the rear of the workshop.
Rigna, Voldar, cover the front entrance.
I'll direct Torg.
Voldar isn't here.
Rigna, go up and tell Voldar... Voldar, this is another one of your delaying tactics.
You've been opposing me at every turn.
Now I'm warning you, change your attitude.
You finished, Chief?
Yes I am.
And you will be, too, if you're not careful.
Oh, but I am carefully, Chief.
So careful that I looked in at the children before I left the ship.
You stay away from those children.
That will be easy to do.
They've escaped.
Voldar, if this is your idea of a joke...
Ask Dropo.
They overheard our plans.
At this very moment, they're on their way to Santa Claus to warn him.
It's true, Kimar.
Their footprints.
We must stop them.
Those children mustn't reach Santa Claus.
Follow them.
I'll put Torg on the trail.
Torg, come out of the spaceship.
Torg.
Come out of the spaceship.
Billy, I can't run anymore.
I'm cold.
And I'm tired.
And it's beginning to snow.
Please, Betty.
Try.
We've got to warn Santa.
We can't stop now.
They might catch us.
Where is Santa?
BILLY: I don't know.
His workshop must be somewhere around here.
Betty, look.
It's Voldar.
BETTY: He's the mean one, the one who doesn't like us.
Come on.
Get back.
Don't move, Betty.
I'll go take a look.
It's all right now, Betty.
Come on.
I'm cold.
I wish it wouldn't snow.
That's the best thing that could happen.
It'll cover our tracks and be harder for the Martians to find us.
And it'll be harder for us to find Santa's workshop.
I'm scared.
We'll find it.
Which way is north?
I see it!
I see it!
Santa's workshop.
BILLY: Where?
Right there.
See the light?
Where?
The lights are moving.
They're coming towards us.
Betty, that's not Santa's house.
Wha... What is it?
BILLY: I don't know.
Good work, Torg.
Now destroy them.
Crush them.
Crush them, Torg.
Do as I say.
Voldar, I knew you'd try something like this.
I set Torg's controls so he will obey only me.
Release them, Torg.
You were very lucky.
Now don't try to escape again.
You may not be so lucky next time.
Hargo, take them back to ship, lock them up, and rejoin us.
You won't get away with this, you... you Martian!
The danger grows with every minute.
Let's get Santa
Claus and blast off.
We'll surround the workshop and send Torg in to get Santa.
Nobody is to be harmed unless they get in our way.
Right.
No one is to be harmed.
What has happened to the great warriors of our planet?
Mars used to be the planet of war.
Mark my words, Kimar, your softness will destroy us.
Santa Claus, toys, games, laughing children.
Well we shall see.
But for now, to your posts.
Torg, follow me.
Get him, Torg.
You can't come in here.
No one's allowed.
Well, where did you come from?
You're the biggest toy I've ever seen.
[LAUGHING]
And very well, made too.
By the great dog star, Santa's treating him like a toy.
Get him, Torg.
Grab him.
He's become a toy.
Rigna, we'll have to get Santa ourselves.
Come on, Voldar.
What have we here?
More toys?
Those are Martians.
Santa Claus, you're coming with us.
No.
You can't take him now.
It's too near Christmas.
Quiet, you.
But...
We don't want to hurt you, Santa Claus, so come along quietly.
Why... why did you have to do that to my helper?
It's harmless.
It'll wear off in a short while.
Oh.
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
Now you come with us.
We need you on Mars.
Are you sure this is harmless?
Oh, I never saw such lazy people, standing around like statues.
There's work to be done.
Let's get to it.
Oh me, oh my, oh me, oh... oh, Mrs. Claus is going to be very angry about this.
Take him, Torg.
Torg, take him.
Obey my command.
Forget it, Kimar.
Rigna was right.
He's nothing but a toy now.
Best to leave him here.
Believe me, I had nothing whatsoever to do about this.
You know my dear, I can't recall a time when you were so silent for so long.
Let's go, old man.
NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): And Mrs.
Santa Claus has positively identified the kidnappers as Martians.
Never in the history of mankind have the nations of the world reacted with such unanimity and cooperation.
Tonight the lights will burn until dawn in the United
Nations building as the leaders of the world a map of course of action.
And at Cape Kennedy, our correspondent interviewed
[INAUDIBLE] Von Green, the man in charge of
America's Starshot program.
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Mr. Von Green, what is the space agency doing about this?
VON GREEN (ON TV): Well, they have mobilized all the men and equipment in our
Starshot project.
And we have rushed our astronauts into an intensive program for the final phase of their training.
Now, our Starshot ship is supposed undergo six months of test flights.
But we are going to forget about the testing and go after those
Martian monkeys.
CORRESPONDENT (VOICEOVER):
Isn't that risky?
VON GREEN (ON TV): Of course it is risky.
But every one of our astronauts is begging for the chance to go after the Martians.
Who wouldn't give everything to bring
Santa back to our children?
Earth hasn't reacted yet.
No radar beams being bounced off our ship.
Looks like we made a clean getaway.
[LAUGHING]
How's our captive?
He's having the time of his life.
He's such a funny little man.
Why, I've only been with him for five minutes, and he has me laughing just like an Earthling.
What's soft, and round, and you put it on a stick, and... and you toast it in a fire, and it's green?
I don't know, what?
A Martian-mallow.
That's what you're all becoming... Martian-mallows.
Soft.
Weak.
That old man is a menace.
Gee, Santa, it's all our fault.
We told them where to find you.
Oh, balderdash and a fiddle-dee-dee, Billy boy.
Everybody knows where Santa lives.
Besides, I've always wanted to visit Mars.
Mommy and Daddy are going to be angry.
You think that's something?
I can just see Mrs. Claus now.
Christmas coming, and I'm not there.
She'll have a fit.
Oh me oh my oh me.
Come and get it.
Dinner time.
Here's Dropo.
If I can't cheer you up, Dropo can.
He always makes me laugh.
Oh, you'll have a wonderful dinner tonight.
Oh, there's soup, and beef stew, and chocolate ice cream.
No thank you, Dropo.
I'm not hungry.
Come on, Billy.
Oh.
Well, is it all right if I have your chocolate ice cream?
Sure.
Oh, I just love chocolate ice cream.
Kimar, look at this.
That small blip is not an asteroid.
It's a spaceship, and it's on our tail, getting closer.
Impossible, Rigna.
They couldn't have spotted us.
We have our radar shield on.
I know that sir, but they are gaining on us.
Is it possible Earth has a secret device that can penetrate our radar shield?
They have a secret device, and his name is Billy Foster.
I warned you that these
Earthlings are dangerous.
They'll destroy us if we allow them.
Well I won't allow them.
I think we underestimate the resourcefulness of these Earth people.
Very clever of the boy.
Make the repairs, Rigna.
I'll take evasive action.
Well.
And how is Santa, and the little Earthlings.
My, it must be tiresome cooped up in this little room.
Say, how would you like to see the rest of the ship?
You're not fooling me.
You don't like us.
You're mean.
Oh, come on now.
That's not true.
Why, Santa makes everyone feel good, even me.
I don't trust you.
Now, now, Billy boy.
That's not the Christmas spirit.
Why, of course, Voldar.
We'd love to take the grand tour.
All right, children.
This room is called...
Airlock.
That's right.
Sure.
This is where you come when you're ready to go out in space.
It's airtight.
You put on your space suit, and go out through that door.
When you come back, the door closes, and they pump air back into the room through there.
When it reaches the pressure of the rest of the ship, you can take your space suit off.
Smart lad.
Well, where's the control that opens the door [INAUDIBLE]?
Not here.
That's in the control deck.
You see, once you pull that switch, the warning bell sounds, and in 60 seconds, that door opens.
Santa, that clock stopped.
60 seconds.
That must be the door timer.
Santa, he locked us in.
Oh, I don't think so.
He probably just stepped out for a moment.
It's locked.
I don't trust Voldar.
He's not like Kimar and the others.
I don't like him.
I'm worried, Santa.
Now, now, children, let's not get excited.
It's Voldar.
He's going to open the space door.
Help, Kimar!
Kimar!
Help!
Gee, Santa, what are we going to do?
Once that door opens, we haven't got a chance.
Eh.
Where'd you say this leads to, Billy?
VOLDAR: Seven six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Who's in the airlock?
No one, now.
What's going on, Voldar?
Oh, Chief, Santa and the children are missing.
Where are they?
Drifting around in space, along with the rest of the space junk.
Before I'm through with you, Voldar, you'll wish you were floating around out there in space.
[LAUGHING]
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Santa Claus, you're all right.
I... I thought you were...
Well, when Voldar accidentally left in the airlock, and then came up here and accidentally threw the door switch, we knew we had to get out of there in a hurry, or that would be the end of us...
Eh, accidentally, of course.
So we crawled up through the air duct.
The air duct.
But the air duct is just a little, and... and you're so big.
[LAUGHING]
Well, you're talking to Santa Claus, son.
KIMAR: But, how...
Well, well now, you wouldn't want me to tell my secret, would you?
[LAUGHING]
Oh... oh, oh, poor man.
He's fainted, just like someone who's seen a ghost.
KIMAR: Begin landing operation.
CREW: (SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.
Uh, Merry Christmas, Voldar.
[MUFFLED SQUEAKING]
All right, on your feet, come on.
Dropo!
Oh, whoa... I was handing him food pills through the bars, and he grabbed my wrists...
Shut up, Dropo.
Kimar, come in quickly.
Kimar?
Yes, Rigna?
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Voldar has escaped.
What?
He's gone.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): That can only mean trouble.
Put a constant guard on
Santa and the Earth children.
Voldar will be back.
Oh, Kimar.
Are you alone?
No.
MOMAR: Well.
KIMAR: Earthlings...
Billy and Betty.
Welcome to our home.
There's someone else, too.
Oh?
Come on.
Come on in.
Lady Momar.
I'm not accustomed to entering people's homes through the door, but you have no chimney.
Welcome, Santa Claus.
We hope you'll make the children on Mars very happy.
I'll try, dear lady.
I'll try.
Where are they?
KIMAR: Well, we'll start with my youngsters.
How are they, Momar?
MOMAR: The same.
Quiet, remote, and very unhappy.
They're inside, studying.
Well, let old Santa say hello to them.
And I'm sure these children would like to meet them.
I'll tell them you're here.
COMPUTER: Y over 5 pi r squared to determine the correct orbit from Mars to Jupiter, traveling along Vector
A through the 17th quadrant at the power of 12 megatrons.
Father!
Father, we missed you.
I missed you, too.
Children, I brought some visitors from Earth.
Will you come in please, children?
Billy and Betty, this is Bomar and Girmar.
Hi.
There's nothing in it.
What are you giving me?
My hand, to shake.
How old are you?
I'm 10, too.
And Girmar's eight.
So is my sister.
We have another Earth person that wants to see you.
What's that?
They're laughing.
Bomar and Girmar, too.
They've never laughed before.
Come.
I can't believe it.
That's the first time in months they've gone to sleep without the sleep spray.
Santa, tomorrow we'll set up a workshop for you.
It won't be exactly the same as the one you have on Earth, but I'm sure it'll serve your purpose.
Good, good.
Now, I'd like to get going and have the toy shop operating full blast, so as I can return to Earth for Christmas.
You know, Mrs. Claus is a very good-natured woman, but...
Santa Claus, you will never return to Earth.
Wha...
Now you belong to Mars.
Ho, ho, ho.
Well, we've no time to lose.
We must go into action.
Now we cannot eliminate Santa Claus, but we can just discredit him, make him a laughingstock throughout Mars.
Come on.
Now listen, carefully.
That workshop closes at 10 o'clock.
The guards will be at Kimar's house, guarding Santa Claus.
Now this is what we'll do, see?
You take...
Two dolls.
Two dolls.
Yes, Betty.
BETTY: Three baseball bats.
Three baseball bats.
Look at me, Santa Claus, the great toymaker, pressing buttons.
That's automation for you.
Technology, oi.
Well, that's enough for today.
Let's close up shop!
OK, Santa.
OK, Santa.
Boy, we sure did a lot today.
SANTA CLAUS: Yes, well, there's another day gone, children.
As they say on Earth, another day, another dollar.
Well, hello, Santa.
How are you feeling today?
Tired?
No, no.
I'm not tired.
But my finger is.
It's been pressing buttons all day long.
Well, I think I'll go in and put my finger to bed.
Here, children.
Here's your milk.
You can play for half an hour, and then you'll have to go to bed.
Daddy, may we watch the Earth program?
Certainly, dear.
But only for half an hour.
Billy?
Betty?
Don't you want to watch the Earth programs?
Oh, no sir.
We're not interested in Earth programs.
I'm going to sleep.
Goodnight.
Me, too.
Just a moment.
Goodnight, Mr. Kimar.
Goodnight, Lady Momar.
Just a moment, children.
Are you feeling well?
Oh, we feel fine, sir.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
KIMAR: Has someone been mistreating you?
Oh, no sir.
You and Lady Momar have just been swell to us.
Goodnight.
What could it be, Momar?
They're behaving the way our children used to behave.
Can't you tell, Kimar?
They're homesick.
They miss their parents, their friends.
Kimar, you've got to send those children back.
Impossible.
Oh, now I'm Santa Claus.
Ho, ho, ho.
Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas everyone!
Ho, ho, ho.
My finger isn't tired.
I think I'll go down to the workshop and make some more toys.
Ho, ho, ho. (SINGING)
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
[HUMMING]
VOLDAR: Shim, pull the light.
No, the light.
Oh, ah, this is going shake 'em up.
These toys will never be the same again.
Shh!
Shh!
Shh!
Someone's coming.
Quick, down.
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride the one horse open sleigh, hey.
What a break.
It's Santa Claus.
He's alone.
No guards.
(SINGING) Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way.
Oh what fun it is to ride... oh, oh, oh.
Now stay put, my fat little friend.
Hey, Santa.
How do you like this toy?
Ho, ho, ho.
My friend asked you a question.
Answer him.
Ho, ho, ho.
Quiet, Shim.
Put on a nuclear curtain.
Tomorrow marks the end of Operation Santa Claus.
And Mars returns to normal.
Dropo, we're here.
He's hiding, Santa.
Oh, playing hide and seek, eh?
All right, Dropo.
Here we come, ready or not.
He's not here, Santa.
That's funny.
Oh, well, he'll turn up.
Let's get started.
Hey, ho!
Ready?
OK.
Let's go.
One teddy bear and one doll.
One teddy bear and one doll.
Santa, stop the machine!
Look!
The doll has a teddy bear's head, and the teddy bear has a doll's head.
I can't understand it.
Oh, let's try it again.
What's next, Betty?
One baseball bat.
SANTA CLAUS: A baseball tennis...
Why, this will never do.
The machine isn't working right.
Oh, dear.
What else, Betty?
A toy train.
A toy train.
Well, all right.
Yes.
Look at that.
Wha... Why, this doesn't make sense.
Well, this never happened when we made toys by hand.
Something very strange is happening here.
Bomar, I think you'd better call your father.
Father?
Father, this is Bomar.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM): Yes, Bomar?
Father, we're in the toy shop.
Dropo was in here, and there's something wrong with the toy machine, too.
KIMAR (ON INTERCOM):
I'll be right over.
Just a word of warning.
If you got any big ideas, forget them.
If you walk through that nuclear curtain, you'll be disintegrated like that.
Sabotage Somebody switched all our wiring.
Dropo's gone.
Your suit is missing.
And now, this machine's been sabotaged.
Put them all together, it spells Voldar.
He was here, and he thought Dropo was me.
He's got Dropo.
And I've got to find him.
Poor Dropo.
Surprised to see us?
You're under arrest, Voldar.
Stop playing with toys.
Put it away, Kimar.
We have a weapon that's much more potent than that.
As you may know, we are holding Santa Claus a hostage.
One false move, and your little ho, ho, ho man will be destroyed.
All right.
What do you want, Voldar?
These are our terms.
First, destroy the toy machine.
Second, we will release Santa Claus if you promise to send him and the Earthlings back to their planet.
Third, no more joy through toys nonsense on Mars.
Well?
Well, you win.
Are you sure you have Santa Claus?
VOLDAR: You know we have him.
You mean you had him.
How did he get out of the cave?
Shim, that idiot!
A-a-and how'd he get here s-s-so fast?
Santa Claus has powers that you don't know about.
All right.
Arms up.
Rigna, Hargo, Lomas, report.
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
This is Rigna, Kimar.
Hargo and Lomas are with me.
Good.
I've got Voldar and Stobo.
I'll keep them here in the storeroom of the toy shop.
Rigna, you come here and take them off my hands.
I want Hargo and Lomas to look for a man named Shim.
Tell them to search the caves along the Transverse Canal.
RIGNA (ON INTERCOM):
Right, Kimar.
All right, you two.
In there.
All right, you might as well relax.
You're going to be here for a while.
Sit down.
SHIM: Where are you going?
Ho, ho, ho.
Can't you say anything else but ho, ho, ho?
DROPO: Ho, ho, ho.
If you're thinking of leaving,
Santa, let me remind you.
Once you hit that nuclear curtain, there won't even be a whisker left.
Ho, ho, ho.
SHIM: Hey, Santa!
Be careful!
What are you going to do with us?
You're going to stand trial before the council.
I don't think you'll be causing any more trouble.
Well now, I think that should do it, Billy boy.
Close the door, son.
Now, I think we need a little red paint.
And you'll find it in the storeroom.
Sure, Santa.
Yes.
That's a good boy.
VOLDAR: This time I'll take care of Santa Claus for good, and smash that machine.
Santa!
Santa!
Voldar and the other man are in the storeroom, and they're coming to get you.
Oh, they are, are they?
Yeh... well, maybe they'd like to have some fun with our toys, and we'll see that they do.
Won't we kids.
Oh-ho, we meet again, eh?
I don't know how you escaped
Shim, but you won't escape me.
You're through.
Voldar, why don't you, uh, relax?
You're going to relax... permanently.
You?
Wha... but, you're not here.
You're in there.
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm not here.
I'm in there.
Wait a minute.
I'm going to see who
Voldar's fighting in there.
What happened?
I don't know what's going on in there, but I'm going to take care of you myself.
Now... now, just a minute.
Now I'd like to talk to... Oh, boy,
Chief, am I glad to see you.
All right, inside, Stobo.
All right, kids, you can stop now.
I said cease fire.
All right, Rigna.
Take them away.
They've had a rough day.
Ho, ho, ho, everybody.
Merry Christmas!
You don't need me here, Kimar.
You've got a wonderful
Santa Claus of your own.
Ho, ho, ho!
Goodbye, Billy.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Betty dear.
You take care of yourself.
Bye.
I've got something for you, Billy.
Gee, thanks.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Gee, we had fun.
We're going to miss you.
Do you think we'll ever meet again?
I'm sure you will, children.
Thank you, Santa, for bringing happiness to the children of Mars.
And the Christmas spirit to all of us.
Son, from the bottom of my heart,
I wish you and yours the very best of everything.
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas, everybody!
Dropo Claus is here.
Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas!
Dropo, you put on weight.
Oh, yes.
No pillows, look.
Look kids, no pillows.
Now, if we hurry, we can get back in time for Christmas Eve.
KIDS: Yay!
Shall we get going?
KIDS: Yay!
Goodbye, dear friends.
Away!
Merry Christmas, everyone!
Away!
MARTIANS: Bye!
Goodbye, Santa Claus!
Goodbye!

CLAUS"]
-= The Long Ships =-
Get that sail rigged!
Hurry it up!
And so, by the storm's fury...
...he lost all he loved most in this world:
His ship and his shipmates.
But he was washed ashore, alone.
The only surviv or.
Monks found him and took him to their monastery...
...where they tenderly nursed him, never asking his name or his country.
And gradually he grew stronger.
As he slowly recovered, he saw that the holy men...
...collected tiny coloured stones.
And, with great patience and loving skill...
...made pictures from them to decorate their chapel.
And the pictures told a story.
A story of a mighty bell made of solid gold.
For days without number the holy men laboured to mak e this mighty bell.
They made ready a great cauldron, and under it a fire burned day and night.
Then came the gold.
Gold from the ends of the earth.
Gold offerings of the crusaders.
Gold urns from the lands of Islam.
Gleaming, liquid gold.
A kingdom of gold.
Gold idols.
Golden rings tak en from the harems.
From wives. From princesses.
From courtesans.
Gold money.
Gold from ships, mines and caravans.
From mosques, palaces and sacred cities.
Gold stolen by robbers from the tombs of Pharaohs.
Golden cups. Golden plate.
Treasure won by conquering armies.
And from its hiding place came the fabulous chain of Nimrud Dag...
...of the 10, 000 golden links.
At last, the huge cauldron was so filled with molten gold...
...that no more could be added.
Then it was poured into a gigantic clay mould.
For days it stood cooling until the hour struck when the clay was torn away.
And so the great golden bell came shining into the world.
They smoothed it.
They polished it.
Then they called on it to speak.
And they ran back in terror and in awe.
And covered their ears.
For this was the Mother of Voices.
Thank you, my friends, for listening to my story.
A romance, you think?
A legend?
No, my friends.
May Allah strike me dead if all I have told you is not true.
Somewhere...
...lost, stolen, perhaps hidden away...
...hangs that great golden bell.
Where? What happened to the bell?
There are those who know.
Do you?
Perhaps.
- Tell us!
- What became of the bell?
Now wait. Wait, my friends.
First I must have encouragement.
My friend, thank you. Thank you.
Please. Please?
Please, my friend.
How can we believe a man with eyes as pale as yours?
I am a Circassian.
I have the eyes of the north. Please.
You have the cold look of a liar.
I come from Byzantium, my friend.
That is how I know about the bell.
And you?
Take him.
You must not make this journey, my lord.
I must.
We are not sailors.
The ocean is not like the desert.
It was not meant to be crossed by us.
I have searched from the mountains to the sea.
Now I must know what lies beyond the horizon.
Understand?
That is what I must do.
- Then take me with you.
- Your duties are here.
My duties are with my husband.
I can no longer sit and wish away the days as the other women do...
...while you chase a legend, a fairy tale...
...that has already cost us dearly in lives and gold.
I am your wife, my lord.
Without your affection,
I wither and die.
How long am I to be denied your attentions?
How long must I endure your abstinence from pleasure?
Until Allah's divine guidance leads me to the treasures of Islam.
That bell is made of pure gold.
Stolen by the Christian armies when they plundered their way across our cities...
...to the dishonour and humiliation...
...of our ancestors.
It was no fairy tale.
Then neither is your appetite for power.
Do not say that again, Aminah.
The bell does exist.
Somewhere in this world, it rests in a Christian land.
So do the pyramids.
And the Gardens of Babylon exist.
Where will you stop, my husband?
When I have found it.
We have a stranger from the market.
He was talking of the Mother of Voices.
Take him to the tower.
I'm afraid that...
I'm afraid there's some grave error, sir.
I am informed that you know the whereabouts of a golden bell...
...the one people call the Mother of Voices.
I see.
Then, that must be the mistake.
No. No, no, I only know the legend.
So do I. I want to know the truth.
But there is no truth.
I was trying to earn enough for food and shelter. No more than that, I swear.
But you know there are always dreamers who will believe anything.
I am no dreamer, Circassian.
As you shall see.
The bell, Circassian.
Please, let me explain, my lord.
I am not a Circassian.
I'm from the north. A Norseman.
I'm a Viking.
I was shipwrecked. I'm simply trying to get back to my homeland.
- You're lying.
- No, my lord, I'm not ly...
- What's that?
- The bell, Circassian.
I know nothing about the bell.
Out in the market I was lying, believe me.
- I do not believe you.
- I know nothing but stories and legends.
I picked them up in Sicily,
Castile, everywhere.
- I don't believe that the bell exists...
- Stop lying!
This always happens!
I tell the truth, nobody believes me.
- I lie, everybody believes me.
- Raschid?
What are you gonna...?
Now, wait.
Now, wait a minute!
Wait! Wait! Wait a minute!
All right!
All right, my lord.
I'll tell you what I know.
Everything I know.
Thank you.
Well...
You see...
We were on our way south, on a raiding voyage.
It'd been a hard month, it'd been blowing for days on end.
And when we did find calm water.
It was only along with fog, my lord.
A thick, dense fog.
And... And then...
And then?
And then...
He knew, Raschid.
- Did he tell you his name?
- No, my lord.
He was nothing. A sailor, a dreamer.
A Norseman!
A Viking.
Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!
A waste of good timber and pitch.
I never thought we'd build a fighting ship for old Slyguts to burn on.
At least our village won't be so poor for a while.
- Father, she's beautiful! Like she's alive!
- Less enthusiasm, or he'll raise the price.
Krok, is she strong enough to sail a dead king?
My people have never built a better ship, my liege.
Never in all our history of shipbuilding.
She could sail to the end of the world.
It is a pity that she will never fight but is only to be burned.
For my funeral?
I know what you really think...
You wish I was already laid out on it.
My funeral sail aflame...
...drifting my soul to Valhalla.
And drifting me out of your sight.
Sire, nothing could be further from my mind!
- You will surely outlive me.
- I'll see to that, Krok.
- Faster!
- Stroke! Stroke!
- They'll never be able to stop.
- Now comes the true test.
Now!
Well, my lord Harald?
Did you ever see a finer ship?
- My men were handling her, don't forget.
- But the ship is good.
I have spent everything
I had building her.
- On the question of payment...
- Not so fast.
First, I must get my shipmaster's report.
- How is she, Sven?
- The best I've handled.
- I'd trade my place in Valhalla to sail her.
- Don't be so eager for Valhalla.
- Prepare for sailing home.
- Sire.
I, Harald, king of Norseland, take this ship!
They play like children.
In my day, they were real Vikings.
The days of the long ships and the tall men.
Now they are merely potbellied swillers of ale! No!
That's right, my liege, times have changed.
More ale, wench.
There's no more ale!
What will we do?
- There isn't any more!
- They're screaming for ale!
Rhykka!
Rhykka!
- Go back to your cooking fires.
- There's no more ale. We're finished.
- Speak for yourself.
- They haven't made the bargain yet.
Well, go and get the reserve barrels!
There is no more ale!
Get out! Stop it! Get out!
You seem to be running out of ale.
More ale, my girl! Quickly.
Orm, my boy, see what's holding up the ale.
- That's enough! Get out!
- Vahlin, we need more ale.
- No more credit.
- We must have more.
- Money.
- We'll pay, I swear.
- No money, no ale.
- You miserable goat!
What is this?
Get some more ale in there.
Go on, tell him.
A man has to look to his own.
No payment, no ale.
You dare stand there before your lawful thane and...
- How much?
- Twelve gold pieces.
- I don't want to do this, but...
- My badge.
It's worth 100 times your miserable 12 pieces. Take it.
Until the king pays me.
I don't want to...
Come on, get these barrels open.
All is well, my liege, plenty of ale.
- Would you like some more, sire?
- No, thank you, Orm.
Your youngest is nearly a man.
Time for him to leave the women and children and join his brother...
...wherever he may be.
Rolfe, my son.
Why, he's plundering the towns and villages along the coasts of Barbary.
He's a true Viking. They'll be singing sagas about him for ages to come.
Enough of him. Now to the business of my funeral ship.
- And the matter of payment.
- A trifling matter.
Silence!
Silence!
Ale! Ale for everyone.
Let your drinking horns be filled, my friends.
Let us drain them to His Majesty
King Harald, and his new long ship...
...his funeral ship...
...when the day arrives.
And may that day be far in the future.
Thank you, friend Krok. Even if you weren't completely sincere. Sven?
Two gold pieces.
The difference between the ship's price and the two years' tribute you owe me.
But, my lord, I told you.
You agreed to wait for the tribute.
- The ship is another matter.
- It was another matter.
The matter is now closed.
We sail the day after tomorrow.
- Where are you going?
- To get some air...
...not filled with a stink of treachery.
- Let me come.
Not now, Ylva. I'm not fit company for anyone right now.
Why, Odin? What did we do that you turn your rage against us and ruin my father?
I have no rage against you.
Let's go in the smokehouse, it's warm in there.
I'll make you forget Odin's rage.
And even the king's daughter.
- Leave me alone!
- Orm, don't go any further. Come back!
- There are trolls and devils from the sea!
- Then go back!
Before these devils grab you and pull you down to the bottom of the sea.
Orm, come back.
This is where Ragnath was taken by the sea trolls and...
It's a devil, all right!
I told you!
It's a trick. It's a devil's trick.
Don't touch him, Orm. Please don't!
Give me a hand, woman.
Come on, give me a hand.
Take his arm.
We've got to get the seawater out of him.
You must learn the Northern Sea is for sailing on, not for drinking.
Now heave ho. Up and out with it.
That's it.
Get some sacks, rub some warmth into him.
The poor devil's half frozen.
Rolfe!
By all the gods of Valhalla!
My brother Rolfe.
Hello.
I've swallowed the ocean.
I got half the fjord in my guts.
What happened?
Where did you come from?
The last I remember
I was in the water.
The Irish pounding at me with their oars.
And your ship? What happened to your ship? Your ship, Rolfe.
My throat's caked with salt.
Get me some ale.
- Get him some ale.
- Lots of ale.
Bring some warm clothes and something to eat. Tell no one, eh?
Then this must be the old smokehouse.
Now I know I'm home.
There's nothing broken but my hide.
That'll soon mend.
- Rolfe, where's the ship?
- I left it some distance away.
How have you managed these past two years?
Father gave you a ship to bring back gold. What happened to it?
It's good to be home again.
How's the fishing been?
Can't you ever give a straight answer?
Rolfe, where is the ship?
Where all good ships go, dear brother.
You lost her.
Ships sink. What can you do about it?
- Get another ship.
- What happened to the crew?
Well, that's quite a long story.
I'll have to tell you about that later.
That ship cost Father the tribute money he owed the king. You've ruined him.
You know...
...l'm beginning to think no one's very happy I came home again.
- You good-for-nothing salmon louse!
- Father!
- Father, control yourself, will you?
- Hell-spawn!
Now, control your...
Father, the gods have sent me home to you!
I should have you spitted to a herring trap. Between high water and low!
- You've ruined me!
- Father!
Oh, my head!
Orm, my son, see if those thirsty rats have left a drop of ale.
My mouth feels as if a she-cat had littered in it.
Please, listen to me.
I want to explain...
I'm not going to listen to you!
I'm a ruined man. An old, broken, ruined man. Because of you.
Now, Father.
Ship, crew and the loot of Barbary lost at the bottom of the sea.
- Yet you manage to return.
- I had to return.
Why? To disgrace me?
To shame me in front of Harald?
I had to come back.
Why?
Because I need another ship.
What? Another ship?!
- Another ship and another crew.
- By the gods!
- Hear me out.
- I've heard enough!
Listen for one moment.
Remember when Orm and I were boys?
We'd creep in to listen to the storytellers.
- What's that to do with it?
- There was a girl.
A dark-skinned girl who used to sing for you, remember?
- Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah.
- A girl from Egypt.
- That's right.
We brought her back with us after a winter expedition.
- Yasmin.
- Yasmin.
Skin like honey.
She used to tell one story we especially loved.
- The story of the bell.
- Right, the Mother of Voices.
- I remember.
- The great golden bell.
Cast long ago by the monks of Byzantium.
A treasure lost for centuries.
The richest prize in all the world,
Father.
- That's why I've returned for a new ship.
- What?!
I've found the bell.
- You found it?
- Yes, Father.
- I don't believe you.
- I found it.
Nothing else would've brought me back after losing my ship.
- You're lying!
- I'm not!
The girl was just repeating some old legend.
I tell you I've found it.
I've heard it. I've seen it.
- You've seen it?
- Yes.
Where?
- What?
- Where have you seen it?
Many leagues to the south.
In Moorish Barbary.
You see, we'd been running before a storm when we ran into fog.
And then through the mist, we heard it.
Booming away like a god's hammer on a mountain of ice.
- The bell of Byzantium.
- How did you know it was the bell?
- How could you be sure?
- It had to be. It could be nothing else.
- I don't believe you.
- Wait.
- He might be telling the truth.
- No, he's a liar!
Always has been a liar, always will be a liar!
That's the way it goes.
The truth, nobody ever believes me.
But this time, Father...
...I think you'll have to believe me.
- Why?
A thane whose entire fortune consists of two gold pieces...
...must believe in the offer of a bell of solid gold.
- Solid gold?
- Solid gold.
As tall as three tall men.
- Three tall men?
- Yes.
I swear to you by all the gods,
I'm telling the truth.
Don't swear by the gods.
They have deserted me.
But I know the bell exists.
I can get it for you. All I need is a ship.
But how can a thane with only two gold pieces find or even equip another ship?
I can arrange all that.
- Because of you, I have nothing left.
- Yes, you do.
You do have something.
- You have the finest ship in the North.
- Not that ship! That's the king's ship!
It's your ship.
It was built by your men.
- It's King Harald's ship!
- He practically stole it!
But he paid for it.
Harald cheated you.
It's still your ship.
He speaks the truth.
But what about a crew?
Getting a crew will be no problem.
One whisper of a golden bell and you could fill 100 ships.
- Right.
- They may not be as credulous as I am.
Now, you just leave the crew to us.
- And the king?
- And leave him to us.
- He'll hang me.
- He won't hang you. He'll hang no one.
He'll harm no one.
We'll take a hostage...
The forward stay is slack. Tighten it.
- Check those barrels.
- Good evening, shipmaster.
What do you want?
- King Harald ordered us to bring you ale.
- King Harald?
Just to whet your whistles before you sail.
- All right.
- Right, bring them aboard.
You all right?
- I wish it were anyone but Gerda.
- No one else will do. Go ahead.
Rolfe?
You're telling the truth about the bell and not just trying to get another ship?
- You have my word.
- That's what worries me.
Good luck.
Right, girls, down to the kitchen before it gets cold.
- All ready to go?
- We sail at first light.
- Not before?
- Everything's ready.
That's all I wanted to know.
Fire!
There he is! Stop him!
Get him!
The haystacks are on fire!
Fire!
Shove off!
Shove off, you split-bellies!
Strike!
Get to the boats!
Hurry! After them!
They've broken the oars!
- Get Sven!
- They've taken him, sire.
- Then follow in the other ships!
- But they've smashed the oars.
They've stolen my ship!
Your sons!
I know, my lord. It was at my command.
Where did they go? Where?!
Answer me!
I'll scour the seas until I find them.
Then I'll hang them. This I swear by Odin!
And I pray that Odin will protect them.
Pray for yourself, old man.
Guards, take him.
Hang him from the tower.
You won't hang me, my lord.
My sons have taken your daughter as a hostage, my lord.
Gather all my long ships.
Make ready to sail!
Let's see you work, you wilted buttercups.
You've been ashore too long.
You're as weak as old men.
Strike, ho.
Strike, ho.
Strike, ho.
Vikings! Subjects of King Harald!
I order you to turn back.
This man has tricked you.
You're all traitors!
Row, you devils!
I command you to turn back.
Or you'll be hanged in the king's name.
I said, row!
Sven's right. You're all traitors!
Now row.
And you.
A black sail! We're all doomed!
Steady.
Steady!
Listen to me.
You're behaving like hysterical old women.
We're going to die!
For doomed men, you all look remarkably healthy.
So the black sail makes it the king's funeral ship. What of it?
Yesterday you greedy devils begged to sail with me. To find the bell.
Half the gold in all the world in one piece.
And not one man will live to see it.
This is a funeral ship. A death ship.
No one sails in her but ghosts.
If you want to see your wives and children again, turn back. Turn back now.
The black sail means the ship is cursed.
And every man aboard her.
Stories for old women. Legends to frighten children into nightmares.
As true as your dream of a golden bell.
So you really think the ship is cursed, Sven?
But we sailors are practical men, aren't we?
Then you tell us, Sven.
You tell us how to lift the curse.
- There's only one way.
- And what is that one way?
To sacrifice a maiden.
A maiden must die.
A maiden must die!
So be it.
No, Rolfe!
Rolfe, stop!
Sweet dreams.
Almighty Odin, almighty Thor...
...accept this maiden whom we are about to sacrifice.
Give us fair winds and a prosperous voyage in return for her young life.
Lift thy curse.
To Odin!
Stay back! The gods deny your eyes.
The curse is lifted.
- You satisfied?
- Who was that girl?
Just a poor wench. You satisfied, or would you prefer a long swim to shore?
- No. I'll stay.
- It's a pity to waste a good seaman.
- I could do with your skill.
- What about these?
I'll have those off. In return for your word that you'll not try anything again.
- And Olla?
- All I need is his word.
- You have it.
- Fine.
And you have mine too. But I warn you,
I'll live for the day I see you hanged.
Well, now, that seems a fair bargain.
Erik, release them.
- Wait, don't leave me here rowing alone.
- Why?
Look at my hands, they're raw.
I'm not used to this life.
- You should have stayed at home.
- I wish I had done.
And so will many of us, friend Vahlin, before this voyage is over.
- You don't feel so well?
- I'm finished with you, Rolfe.
- Come here.
- What for?
Come on.
Go ahead.
Go on.
Gerda!
She's alive!
- Seems to be.
- My father will hang you for this...
Now bite on that before those bearded doves hear you.
You didn't kill her.
I killed a sheep.
My foot under the royal rump...
...and she was below hatches in a twinkle.
But if they find out she's still alive, that'll be the end of us.
And you.
So stay out of sight and be quiet.
- Get her something to eat.
- Okay.
Rolfe.
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.
I'm used to our cold Northern Seas, but this warm fog clings to my flesh.
- It's nothing to worry about.
- I can't see anything.
No wind. Why did the wind die down all of a sudden?
Blister your hides, row!
Keep them at it, Rhykka.
Back to your places!
The edge of the world!
We're doomed!
We're all gonna die! We're doomed!
- Orm?
- Gerda!
- I'm frightened, Orm.
- The girl!
The sacrifice, back from the dead!
Kill him and the woman before he drags us to our doom.
Not the girl, she's King Harald's daughter. But kill him.
Rolfe, the bell!
The bell.
- Where is it?
- There! I see it!
There!
We found it!
Hear me!
Hear me, my brothers!
You see, we're alive.
Even though the woman is still aboard.
We've found the bell!
And tomorrow, by the hammer of Thor...
...we take it!
Hard over.
- Hard over!
- Get to your oars!
Come on, move!
Well, there's an end to the golden bell.
And we were so close.
- Where are we, anyway?
- Somewhere on the Moorish coast.
See if you can get them moving.
We have a lot of work to do.
Come on, up.
We've got a ship to repair, come on.
- Move.
- Move, come on.
Move. Come on, get up.
- Get up there.
- Come on, everybody up.
Someday, somehow, I'm gonna make up for all this misery I've caused you.
It's all right, Orm, at least we're still alive.
Well.
You seem to be both in good condition.
You all right?
We need your help.
And, princess, I think you'd better...
You brought us to this.
May the trolls and sea devils drag you down to hell.
First you offered King Harald's daughter as a sacrifice to lift the curse.
Then you invoked the sea gods and tricked us.
You can't lie to the gods.
They sent the maelstrom.
It was there.
It had nothing to do with any gods.
We should've cut his throat when we had the chance.
You have the chance now, you fat-gutted rat.
Why don't you take it?
Down, everybody down!
Two lines! Form two lines!
Hurry!
All right, down low!
Hold it.
Wait.
Now!
Now!
Set the steel!
Set the steel!
Pull up! Set the steel!
Hurry it up!
Hold it.
Save your cheering, get back to work.
Were they the Moorish?
That they were.
- And they don't like giving up.
- Neither do we.
We didn't.
- Move the wounded back to the ship.
- You all right?
- Yes. You're hurt.
- It's nothing.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Gather up your weapons.
Look.
They're back.
Get ready! Form a line!
Keep low.
- No defence.
- What do you mean, no defence?
- No defence!
- I thought you said we didn't give up.
There are too many of them.
I said no defence.
Move! Move! Move!
Oh, no.
Welcome again, Norseman.
- You'd wonder how they go to sea in that.
- They don't go in the real sea.
She'll founder in a light breeze.
Well...
...where are we?
Civilization.
You wouldn't understand that.
Take him to the tower.
That one.
Seventy of them.
Only one woman between them.
- We're 20 wives and only one husband.
- It's not fair.
Why did you come back, Viking?
I missed you.
You came back for the bell.
I did?
Where is it?
- I don't know.
- You're lying!
Well, now, that's for you to decide, isn't it?
Forgive the intrusion.
How good it is, Norseman, to have you once again as my guest.
I wish I could say the same, my lord.
I have made some small changes to the room.
I hope you approve.
Yes, they do make a difference, don't they?
Now...
...let us discuss the bell.
First, I'd like to know what you're going to do with my people.
Well, since you are the only one of importance to me...
...they are, of course, to be sold as slaves...
...which is what we customarily do with our prisoners.
The bell.
You seem to have me at a disadvantage again, my lord.
Even so, I am afraid it will do you no good.
I have no more patience with you, savage.
Now speak up.
I can tell you nothing.
Please, please, my lord.
We sailed in violent storms, blown many leagues off our course.
I have no idea how to find your bell.
Perhaps a hundred lashes will give you an idea.
Even if I knew the course, you'd never get there.
Why not? I have a ship.
Your ship?
Forgive me, my lord.
I don't mean to be critical, but you
Moors don't make very good sailors.
For the last time, Norseman...
...where is the bell?
I don't know.
Enough.
Come with me.
Girls.
About that Viking girl...
You mean the savage who calls herself a princess?
- I ordered her not to be sold.
- Why?
I want to know what she knows about the bell.
- Prepare her to come to me tonight.
- That dirty animal?
She's a barbarian fit only to tend pigs.
- Jealousy becomes you.
- Jealous, my lord?
How can you think that?
This means you have learned nothing from the Viking.
- He is stronger than you thought.
- Perhaps not.
So you have failed with him again.
You were unable to make a single Viking talk.
- So you choose to conquer a savage girl.
- With fire in your cheeks you are lovely...
...but watch your tongue before you find yourself a slave, whipped and sold.
That may be better than the loneliness of weeks and months...
...without love or affection.
It will be better soon...
...and when this is behind us, you shall have everything.
You shall be the most envied woman in all Islam.
I promise.
I only want to share my life with you again.
Like when we were children.
A little laughter, a tender word or two.
An imaginary trip to Damascus on a magic carpet.
Remember, my lord?
We never found the carpet that could fly...
...did we?
Be patient, Aminah...
...and we shall share the greatest prize on earth.
Let me deal with the girl, my lord.
I will get from her whatever she knows.
- Let me help you.
- No.
I shall attend to it myself.
Now go and prepare her.
- Don't be afraid.
- Look, the Viking girl.
She's beautiful.
Fair skin.
Attention.
There'll be freedom...
...the best of food and wine...
...women...
All this to the man who tells where the bell is to be found.
Speak up.
A helmet full of gold from my lord Aly Mansuh.
We... We heard something...
Take him away.
No, leave me alone.
I don't know anything.
No, no, I tell you, I don't!
Bite through these.
Where's Rolfe?
- Gone to make a bargain.
- Not Rolfe.
You saw how they beat him.
He said nothing.
He's had time to think.
He'll get out, and we should too.
- You'll never get beyond the palace.
- Look...
We have two choices.
To get out or stay here and rot.
- I say we should wait for Rolfe.
- I say we should see what he's doing.
What are you looking for?
You wouldn't have your husband hidden here, would you?
We are quite alone.
We are?
Well, that's good.
Well...
...what can I do for you, my lady?
- I would like to do something for you.
- You would?
And...
...what would that be?
I can offer you and your comrades...
...the chance to live and to sail from these shores as rich men.
- What do you say?
- Just name your price.
- Who spoke of a price?
- Who gives anything without one?
I only want the bell.
You too.
No, I'm afraid I can't help you, my lady.
- You disappoint me.
- Why?
You don't think I would speak without full knowledge, do you?
The bell, Viking. The bell which lies near the Pillars of Hercules.
From the description, it can be no other place.
What description?
The man Vahlin talked.
Oh, did he? Did he, now?
Well, I don't know anything about the Pillars of Hercules, you call it?
But if you know where this bell is...
...why don't you and your husband get it?
Because my husband needs your skill, your Viking seamanship.
We are invincible in this desert.
On the high seas we are as children.
You are seafarers. We are landsmen.
It is as simple as that.
I see.
So...
...what are you offering me?
A ship and your own men to man it.
- A Moorish ship?
- What else?
I'd as soon go to sea in a fish basket.
To get through the maelstrom that guards the...
- And you didn't know about the bell?
- All right.
Anyway, you need a real ship.
A Moorish galley would never make it.
- You must try.
- No, it's impossible, absolutely...
Well, I have an idea.
My own ship lies beached down there on the coast.
She got through rough waters once.
Let me repair her and she'll do it again.
How long would you take?
Not long. Just a few days, given the timber and my crew.
I'd like to ask you something, my lady.
In whose name are you making this offer?
Your husband, or yourself?
I speak for both, my husband and myself.
I see.
And why should he leave such a delicate problem to you?
Because tonight he is occupied.
They told me you tried to scratch your cheeks with your nails.
That would have been a crime.
You are beautiful, and they have prepared you well.
I can see now that you possibly are the daughter of a king.
Touch me and my father will burn your city to the ground.
You are trembling.
Are you afraid?
- Where are we?
- By the smell, it must be the harem.
- We won't find Sven in there.
- No, but we might find Gerda.
Quiet!
Where's that Northern girl?
Tell me or I'll cut your head off.
- She's with my lord.
- Where?
The door at the end of the passage.
Vikings!
I shall hang every man of them from the city walls...
...and leave them for the kites and jackals!
Where is the Lady Aminah?
Orgy! Orgy!
- Where is he?
- Who, my lord?
- The barbarian was with you.
- I had him brought to me.
- On whose authority?
- You weary me with such questions.
While you were busy with your snow princess...
...I arranged for the barbarian to lead us to the bell.
- What are those arrangements?
- All in good time, my lord.
I must see your master.
Where is Aly Mansuh?
Where is Aly Mansuh?
I must speak to him!
I shall wait upon you later, my lady.
If ever we had children, my lady, what princely liars they would be.
- You must go now.
- All right.
No, this way.
Thief! Thief! Barbarian!
Aminah.
You shall pay for this insult to me.
You shall ride the Mare of Steel.
Well, Viking, you take it bravely.
Well, I have little choice.
- You have not seen it at work before?
- Fortunately, no.
Had you done so, I promise that you would not be prepared to die so calmly.
My lord...
...I assure you,
I am anything but calm.
I shall arrange a demonstration.
My lord.
Please. Not one of my men.
Never fear. I need them.
They have work to do.
I will show you how a Moor can die.
You Vikings are eternally boasting of your courage.
I shall give you an example of real courage that comes from authority.
My authority.
Aminah, select me a man.
One of my guards. He must ride the Mare of Steel before the Viking.
Aminah?
You believe in Allah?
Go, then.
Your turn, Viking.
My lord!
I hope you realize this revenge of yours will lose you the bell.
You need more than just a Viking ship and crew!
You need a navigator!
You need me!
But I have a Viking navigator.
A man in every way as skilled as yourself.
The sailing master to King Harald of Norseland. He will lead your crew.
The Vikings don't go without Rolfe.
Aye!
- Then you shall be next.
- We go together.
- To the ship or to the Mare of Steel.
- That's right.
No, Orm!
Either you live or we die together.
Then the bell will be gone forever.
Then we shall take the Viking girl.
And if you play me false in any way...
...she shall be the first to feel the kiss of steel.
Come on! Make him move!
All right.
Now, let's see you work.
Come on, get your backs into it.
Get those ropes stowed away.
Come on, move.
I said, move!
Go ahead. But then who would find your precious bell?
- On whose side do you fight?
- I obey orders.
Then let the work continue.
We sail tomorrow. And may Allah send us a fair wind and a calm sea.
And may Thor do the same, my lord.
All right! Back to work!
All of you!
You seem to have...
...divided loyalties, Sven.
My loyalties are to the king, his daughter and his ship.
That sounds very honourable...
...but how does that fit in with your arrangements with Mansuh?
As long as he looks for the bell, the ship and girl are safe.
I see.
- And what are your plans for me?
- King Harald must decide.
So until he finds us, we fight the same battle?
We do.
That is, of course, if he ever does find us.
He will.
- What are they doing?
- We're nearing the maelstrom.
Steady.
Steady.
Steady.
Get ready.
Hold her firm.
Now!
There! There it is!
Both of you go forward.
Steady as she goes. Steady.
Stand by the ship oars.
A great, golden bell.
It's the dome.
The whole dome is the bell!
Orm!
- Now tie that on.
- Right.
Steady there on the chains.
Stretch it out, back that way.
Ready?
All right, heave.
Heave!
More! Now hold it.
Now move it to the right.
- Gently.
- Ease it up!
Just make sure the bell gets down safely.
Move it to the right.
Watch it!
Well, that was the quick way to get it down.
Tie off that far line.
Orm, see that all lines are secure.
What is it?
Mansuh has ordered me to be ready to sail within the hour.
- Then Harald's ships never sailed.
- They must have sailed.
Then where are they?
Well, there's nothing we can do but return to the city.
And we can't try anything on the way back or we'll lose everything.
- Including ourselves.
- And what happens...
...when we return to the city and Mansuh no longer needs us?
I don't know.
Civilization again.
You can keep it. Give me the hills and fjords of Scandia.
You won't see them again.
Why not? We're bringing back
Aly Mansuh and the bell safely.
The only reward we're ever likely to get is a ride on a Mare of Steel.
- It's so quiet.
- I know.
- And there's something missing.
- What?
Their weapons.
- Now?
- No.
Wait.
My lord, the long ships!
Beware of the long ships!
Beware of the long ships!
My lord, the long ships came in the night.
We could do nothing to warn you.
Aminah.
I would like to say...
Cut the bonds!
Allah!
Vikings!
Gerda!
The king's orders.
- You're too old to fight!
- Too old? Get out of my way!
- Vahlin! I owe you some money.
- It's nothing, sir.
Always pay your debts.
Makes you sleep better.
Thank you. A wonderful rule, sir.
Naturally, I expect my friends to pay their debts too.
- Come on!
- I've got it here, sir.
If you only knew what I've been through, sir. 12 gold pieces, remember?
Well, Viking...
...my vow has been accomplished.
We have found...
...the bell.
- Welcome, Father.
- Rolfe, my son.
You see? I wasn't lying.
I sailed in my long ships to find you,
Rolfe, and to hang you.
Yes, sire.
However, as my daughter is safe and my ship is still afloat...
And as we have found the greatest prize in all the world...
...in which you, of course, will share, my sire.
- Then...
- Then?
Then come here.
- Sire, I'd like to ask you something.
- Yes?
Have you ever heard of the three crowns of the Saxon kings?
No.
It seems that one of the crowns was adorned with a great jewel.
A diamond as big as a gull's egg.
The three crowns have been lost for many years...
...but I feel, sire, that if we organized a proper expedition...
...it would be quite possible to find them.

{1415}{1500}# 'Green Leaves Of Summer'
{4939}{5031}General Houston's arrived, gentlemen.|- Refreshments?
{5035}{5105}Thank you, Doc.
{5155}{5247}71 cold, windy, rump-bumping miles...|since yesterday!
{5251}{5365}You wouldn't have it|any other way, Lightfoot.
{5754}{5828}Company, stand to!
{5898}{5942}Attention!
{5946}{6010}As you are.
{6018}{6086}{y:i}¡Don Esparza!|- ¡Mi general!
{6090}{6158}General Houston, may I|order the men to bivouac?
{6162}{6254}The forced marches took it out of them.|- Foot soldiers may.
{6258}{6302}Feed the others, care for their horses...
{6306}{6398}{y:i}...and tell them there'll be|another march within the hour.
{6402}{6422}Yes, sir! Sergeant!
{6426}{6470}Doctor.|- Sam.
{6474}{6517}Dickinson.|- General, sir.
{6521}{6637}General, it ain't none of my business,|but you ain't ate since yesterday.
{6641}{6685}I'll sit it on the table here.
{6689}{6757}Where's Jim Bowie?
{6761}{6895}When certain people ain't ate,|they're meaner than a bobcat!
{6977}{7021}Mr Dickinson...
{7025}{7106}I asked you a question.
{7169}{7213}Where's Jim Bowie?
{7217}{7261}He's indisposed, sir.
{7265}{7333}By God, if you mean drunk,|you say drunk, sir!
{7337}{7405}He's drunk, sir.
{7409}{7453}What's your name?|- James Butler Bonham.
{7457}{7541}In Travis's command, sir.
{7576}{7628}Hm.
{7696}{7784}Neill, you go north with me.
{7792}{7836}Colonel Travis will be in command here.
{7840}{7908}Major, sir.|- Colonel Travis.
{7912}{7980}I'll send the commission through.|- Thank you, General.
{7984}{8100}Let me assure you I'll do...|- We'll dispense with the amenities. Now...
{8104}{8172}I've been given command|of the armies of Texas.
{8176}{8268}But the fly in the buttermilk is|there ain't no armies in Texas!
{8272}{8340}A few good friends and some willing men.
{8344}{8412}I'm gonna have to knock|some of those men into an army...
{8416}{8460}{y:i}...and to do that I need time.
{8464}{8579}You people right here on the real ground|are gonna have to buy me that time.
{8583}{8651}You have to keep Santa Anna|off the back of my neck...
{8655}{8747}...until I can get in shape to fight him.|- So you're ordering me to...
{8751}{8843}Dammit! I am ordering you to command!|How and what you do is your problem!
{8847}{8915}But, Sam, what about Jim Bowie?
{8919}{8987}Jim Bowie, as Mr Bonham|has informed us, is indisposed.
{8991}{9059}Yes, sir. But I'd like to point out...
{9063}{9131}{y:i}...that Jim Bowie is leading|a hundred volunteers...
{9135}{9227}...whereas young Travis here|commands less than 30 regulars.
{9279}{9347}General Houston, I think|we oughta discuss this...
{9351}{9467}Clear the room! Gentlemen, I would have|a word with Mr Travis if you'll excuse us.
{9471}{9536}Con permiso.
{9782}{9898}Mr Travis, were you going to|complain to me about Jim Bowie?
{9902}{9946}Not complain, sir.
{9950}{9994}Of course Jim Bowie's drunk.
{9998}{10090}He took this town from General Cos.|He fought a battle.
{10094}{10138}And now he's drunk.
{10142}{10227}Seems kinda natural to me.
{10238}{10330}Or perhaps you question something|other than Bowie's drinking.
{10334}{10426}Are you gonna tell me that he's got|a lot of acreage around here?
{10430}{10474}That he's married into|the Mexican aristocracy?
{10478}{10521}Yes, sir.
{10525}{10569}I would trust Jim Bowie with my life.
{10573}{10641}More than that, I would trust him|with the lives of my family.
{10645}{10737}And more than that, I would trust him|with the life of Texas.
{10741}{10785}Sir.|- That's all, Travis.
{10789}{10847}Travis!
{10933}{11001}I've never been able to like you.
{11005}{11121}But you are another one of the very few|men I would trust with the life of Texas.
{11125}{11169}For that, thank you, sir.
{11173}{11241}And it may very well be...
{11245}{11361}{y:i}...that that life rests in your hands now.
{11916}{11960}Jethro! Is that you?
{11964}{12008}Yes, sir, General. This is me.
{12012}{12056}How are you still alive?
{12060}{12152}You had white hair when I was a boy|and now we look the same age.
{12156}{12200}Yes, sir.
{12204}{12320}But I've been a temperate and|God-fearing man all my life, sir.
{12324}{12414}Well, I guess my past is out!
{12420}{12511}Jethro, you tell your Mr Jim|I'm sorry to hear about his illness.
{12515}{12559}I wish him a speedy recovery.
{12563}{12631}And assure him of my undying affection.
{12635}{12655}Yes, sir.
{12659}{12727}And, General Sam, sir, he love you too.
{12731}{12823}And them words of yours|gonna put him right back on his feet.
{12827}{12871}He got a colic, you know.|- I heard.
{12875}{12919}In the stomach.
{12923}{12967}Stay temperate, old man!
{12971}{12991}Neill!
{12995}{13039}Column right! Forward!
{13043}{13100}Yo-ho!
{13139}{13209}Take care, men!
{14434}{14514}You all right, Mr Jim?
{14529}{14573}Yeah.
{14577}{14647}Sit down, Jeth.
{14817}{14871}Ohh!
{14889}{14933}Can I get you something, sir?|- No, no.
{14937}{15012}You just sit there.
{15201}{15269}Houston's gone?
{15273}{15334}Yes, sir.
{15393}{15488}Come and gone and me lying drunk.
{15704}{15804}Colonel Travis! Bowie's approaching!
{16184}{16239}Halt!
{16256}{16328}Carry on, sentry!
{16400}{16444}Recall work parties!
{16448}{16533}Prepare for flag ceremony!
{16591}{16675}Detail! Forward... march!
{17311}{17382}Present... arms!
{17550}{17618}Order... arms!
{17646}{17714}We stand here ready to do our duty...
{17718}{17810}{y:i}...and cognisant of the will of God.
{17814}{17858}Captain Dickinson!
{17862}{17906}Dismiss the ceremony!
{17910}{18026}And, Captain, inform the men that|work details will be dismissed at 4.30...
{18030}{18146}{y:i}...in order that family men may gather|their dependants within these walls.
{18150}{18211}Yes, sir!
{18366}{18410}Lieutenant Blake!|- Yes, sir!
{18414}{18482}You will see to the quartering|of Bowie's volunteers.
{18486}{18505}Yes, sir!
{18509}{18590}You men will follow me!
{18725}{18793}Jeth, Blake'll show you|to our quarters. Set 'em up.
{18797}{18858}Yes, sir.
{19469}{19536}Colonel Bowie.
{19540}{19643}Santa Anna's got an army of 7,000 men.
{19708}{19752}So?
{19756}{19848}Well, you ain't gonna try to defend|this broken-down church...
{19852}{19920}...against 7,000 battle-hard troops?
{19924}{19968}Colonel Bowie.
{19972}{20040}You were drunk at the last officers' call.
{20044}{20136}And I would rather postpone|our discussion until the next.
{20140}{20208}At which time I will explain my plans...
{20212}{20346}{y:i}...and give orders for|the implementing of those plans.
{20931}{20951}Hey, Jim!
{20955}{21023}Why do we have to work like this?
{21027}{21095}I volunteered to fight, not to build no fort.
{21099}{21143}How come we have to work like this?
{21147}{21215}Because old Sam told Travis,|Travis told me...
{21219}{21287}{y:i}...and I'm telling you!
{21291}{21437}Somebody's comin' hellbent for leather,|sinking spurs at every jump!
{21459}{21514}Halt!
{21554}{21598}Corporal of the guard!
{21602}{21666}Post No. 1!
{21674}{21766}No civilians may enter the fort,|Señor Seguin. I'm sorry.
{21770}{21838}Juan! Silverio!|Let 'em through, Dick!
{21842}{21886}Captain Dickinson!
{21890}{21910}Yes, sir.
{21914}{22006}Come to my office, please, Captain.|- Yes, sir.
{22010}{22100}Tengo noticias de Santa Anna.
{22154}{22246}Good afternoon, Colonel Travis.|We have news of Santa Anna.
{22250}{22318}My son and I have...|- Good day, Señor Seguin.
{22322}{22438}Señor, even though you're|the alcalde of San Antonio de Bexar...
{22442}{22509}{y:i}...it does not exempt you|from military prohibitions.
{22513}{22581}This establishment is closed to all civilians!
{22585}{22653}I'm very sorry, Colonel Travis.
{22657}{22725}Had I known your restrictions|applied to me and my family, sir...
{22729}{22821}Now, wait a minute, Travis!|The Seguins have news of Santa Anna.
{22825}{22893}We have a dozen rumours a day.|- You can't just...
{22897}{22965}Por favor, Juan, tell him.
{22969}{23013}Colonel, the Indians of San Blas...
{23017}{23133}{y:i}...sent couriers to the vaqueros of|my properties along the Sangre de Cristo.
{23137}{23205}They say many soldiers crossed|the Baja Diablo two days ago.
{23209}{23277}That puts 'em a lot closer than you thought.
{23281}{23373}The Indians guessed the number|of troops at over 5,000.
{23377}{23493}There are also large numbers of|mounted soldiers and supply trains.
{23497}{23588}Also, lower down on the Baja Diablo|another party of Indians saw signs...
{23592}{23684}{y:i}...of shod horses crossing a ford.|- I'm sorry, Señor Seguin.
{23688}{23780}As a civilian, you cannot realise|how worthless this information is.
{23784}{23828}'Some Indian told some vaqueros...'
{23832}{23900}Anyway, thank you, sir. Good day.
{23904}{23972}You know the Seguins|are absolutely reliable!
{23976}{24044}If you'll excuse me.|- I meant no personal offence, señor.
{24048}{24140}But I cannot make a plan|based on third-hand rumours.
{24144}{24236}I do not take personal affront,|Colonel Travis...
{24240}{24356}{y:i}...else I should be forced to act|other than to simply bid you good day.
{24360}{24438}Adiós, Juan.|- Adiós.
{24671}{24758}You're a damn fool, Travis.
{25702}{25786}A true gentleman, Seguin.
{25822}{25910}I dislike being rude to him.
{25966}{26010}Even allowing for exaggeration...
{26014}{26106}...Santa Anna must have|crossed the Baja in strength.
{26110}{26178}But I had to do it, Dick.
{26182}{26322}I'd say we have two or at best|three days before we see his banners.
{26326}{26370}The men were listening.
{26374}{26533}And I can't let that rabble know how weak|we are and how strong the enemy is.
{26565}{26657}You couldn't do that, eh?|- No, I couldn't.
{26661}{26753}My honest and truthful|and plain-spoken friend.
{26757}{26825}{y:i}You could, perhaps, but I couldn't.
{26829}{26873}Now, take a look at this.
{26877}{26921}This oblique rampart here...
{26925}{27041}Well, have sense, Dick! Why should|those men stay if they knew the truth?
{27045}{27089}It's different for Bowie, of course.
{27093}{27185}He's got a big stake in Texas.|A couple of million acres, I hear.
{27189}{27281}Some of those men haven't got...|- Have you got any dollars or acres?
{27285}{27403}I've got an extra suit of clothes.|You know that.
{27620}{27664}Boy! So that's it!
{27668}{27712}San Antonio de Bexar.
{27716}{27784}It means Saint Anthony in English.
{27788}{27889}The colonel speaks Spanish, you know.
{28004}{28086}Are you gonna pray, sir?
{28100}{28144}But why, sir?
{28148}{28240}I mean, there wasn't|no doubt we'd find her.
{28244}{28360}The colonel just wasn't sure which one|of these here creeks was the shortest cut.
{28364}{28432}He ain't been here in nigh 15 years.
{28436}{28480}Better make the signal, boy.
{28484}{28527}Yes, sir.
{28531}{28575}I hope this powder ain't damp.
{28579}{28671}You don't take it wrong|I ask you all these questions, Parson?
{28675}{28743}No, boy, that's how you learn. Asking.
{28747}{28791}Yes, sir.
{28795}{28911}So many times every day|you stop and give thanks.
{28915}{29007}Mostly I can't catch on to what|you're thanking the Lord for.
{29011}{29055}I mean, there's nothin' special.
{29059}{29103}I give thanks for the time and the place.
{29107}{29175}The time and place, Parson?
{29179}{29271}A time to live and a place to die.|That's all any man gets.
{29275}{29319}No more, no less.
{29323}{29418}Fire the signal, boy.|- Yes, sir.
{29706}{29793}Must be Parson and the boy!
{29826}{29887}Think so!
{30953}{31021}Well, there she be, Colonel!
{31025}{31069}After 20 days of hard ridin'!
{31073}{31141}We gonna have to learn|the lingo they use down here, Davy?
{31145}{31237}Where do we go, Davy?|To the town or to the fort?
{31241}{31285}There's no fort. It's an old mission.
{31289}{31405}You better take a better look.|A lot of people movin' in there.
{31409}{31477}Them guns don't give it|no mission look to me.
{31481}{31524}Colonel...
{31528}{31616}What do C-A-N-T-I-N-A spell?
{31648}{31740}Cantina. Do it mean what I think it do?|- It do.
{31744}{31870}It means out of these deerskins|and into our foofaraw!
{32200}{32278}Hey, you got my coat!
{32583}{32603}Hey, Pedro!
{32607}{32651}Hand me down that guitar.
{32655}{32747}Now I want you folks to all|clump in here close together.
{32751}{32819}I want you Texicans to open up your ears...
{32823}{32937}{y:i}...and listen to a little pure Tennessee.
{32943}{32987}# Here's to the ladies...
{32991}{33035}# I love 'em all...
{33039}{33131}# Here's to the ones I recall...
{33135}{33179}# Here's to the ladies...
{33183}{33227}# Married or free...
{33231}{33299}# They all look pretty good to me...
{33303}{33347}# The big and small ones...
{33351}{33395}# The short and tall ones...
{33399}{33443}# Each one a lovely...
{33447}{33502}Halt!
{33542}{33562}# Here's to the ladies...
{33566}{33634}# I love the ladies...
{33638}{33706}Captain Dickinson, split your patrol.
{33710}{33802}Send half each way down the river for|about five miles to look for any signs.
{33806}{33874}Then report back to the mission.|- Yes, sir.
{33878}{33948}Forward! Yo-ho!
{34645}{34689}Sorry, sir!
{34693}{34771}She sorta come loose!
{34813}{34877}I'd like...
{34885}{34977}I'd like to speak to David Crockett.|- You did.
{34981}{35049}That was David Crockett from Tennessee?
{35053}{35145}Yes, sir. And I oughta know.|Me and him's neighbours back home.
{35149}{35217}Only live 40 mile apart.
{35221}{35288}Colonel Davy!
{35437}{35504}Are you David Crockett, sir?|- That's my name.
{35508}{35576}I'm Colonel Travis,|commanding the garrison.
{35580}{35600}I figured.
{35604}{35711}Well, son, you'd better start growing up.
{35772}{35840}I'd like to speak to you|on a matter of gravest importance.
{35844}{35929}Sure. Let's find a corner.
{35988}{36063}Talking's dry work!
{36204}{36282}You're learnin' fast!
{36348}{36392}Colonel!
{36396}{36440}I'm resignin' from you.
{36444}{36535}I'm gonna marry up with Conchita|and be the man of this house.
{36539}{36583}Bésame a kiss, señorita.
{36587}{36655}I toss around a mess|of that proud Spanish, too.
{36659}{36703}Most important part.
{36707}{36797}Let's jig a little, mamacita.
{36827}{36895}Light there and rest easy, Travis...
{36899}{36967}...while I bed down this buck.
{36971}{37074}He just ain't got no head for whiskey!
{37091}{37135}Parson!|- Yeah, Davy!
{37139}{37224}Take him away.|- Yes, sir!
{37355}{37423}Let's wet our whistles.
{37427}{37471}Words are dusty.
{37475}{37542}I don't drink.
{37546}{37614}Not ever?|- No.
{37618}{37686}I've heard of such.
{37690}{37734}Well, spread your wampum, Travis.
{37738}{37782}My title is colonel.
{37786}{37854}Me, I'm a colonel, too.
{37858}{37926}Wouldn't it sound kinda silly,|chattering colonel, colonel...
{37930}{37998}{y:i}...like a couple of marsh shield birds?
{38002}{38070}Just speak right up and call me Crockett.
{38074}{38118}Don't bother to use my title.
{38122}{38238}Old drunken General Flatford gave it|to me in the Choctaw Indian War.
{38242}{38320}I'll call you Travis.
{38410}{38478}Very well, Crockett.
{38482}{38573}I'd like your permission|to make a speech to your men.
{38577}{38669}Well, they've heard many a speech|while I was congressifying.
{38673}{38717}What would you talk about?
{38721}{38811}Oh, about freedom... liberty.
{38817}{38885}Well, they don't need any such speech.
{38889}{38957}These men are from Tennessee.
{38961}{39101}I'd like to explain why I want them|to volunteer to fight against Santa Anna.
{39105}{39157}Oh?
{39225}{39293}Not so careless!
{39297}{39418}You can't get new clothes|this side of Nacogdoches.
{39441}{39495}Tag!
{39560}{39652}Tennesseans ain't exactly against fighting...
{39656}{39772}{y:i}...but they ain't much for listening|to speeches. What would you tell them?
{39776}{39868}Of the many and unendurable hardships|the people have been subjected to...
{39872}{39988}...under the tyrannical government|of this military dictator Santa Anna.
{39992}{40060}We have no rights in the courts,|no market for our produce.
{40064}{40156}He has forbidden trade with the North.
{40160}{40204}Davy!
{40208}{40276}I want a chance for my money back.
{40280}{40372}Why don't you leave Davy alone?|He done beat you 38 times hand-runnin'!
{40519}{40587}This'll only take a minute, Travis.
{40591}{40659}Give me them feathers.
{40663}{40725}Gentlemen.
{40783}{40863}Balance your feathers.
{40903}{40968}Get set! Go!
{41455}{41570}Gotcha that time, Davy.|- It was fair and square.
{41574}{41666}If we can continue, I would like to say...|- One minute, Travis.
{41670}{41714}That was just for who gets first chance.
{41718}{41822}Prepare yourself, Davy.|- I'm prepared.
{41838}{41906}He's still on his feet!
{41910}{41930}Oh, no!
{41934}{42002}Oh, yes!|- Oh, yes!
{42006}{42078}And it's my turn!
{42294}{42410}He'll never learn!|Let's get a bucket of water.
{42414}{42482}Kind of a game the boys play|back in Tennessee.
{42486}{42577}Even though time is running out,|I must postpone this interview...
{42581}{42649}...until we can be assured|of no interruptions.
{42653}{42819}Step down off your high horse, mister.|You don't get lard less'n you boil the hog.
{42893}{42961}Have one of these cigars.
{42965}{43075}I brought 'em all the way from New Orleans.
{43085}{43153}Were you going to tell my Tennesseans...
{43157}{43201}{y:i}...that a good many men...
{43205}{43249}...sound men all...
{43253}{43345}{y:i}...had a plot to ease the suffering|of the people in these parts?
{43349}{43441}Or were you going to tell them|that Steve Austin, Houston and others...
{43445}{43584}{y:i}...and you too, Travis, had planned|to declare for a republic?
{43588}{43656}To declare this the Republic of Texas?
{43660}{43761}Were you gonna tell 'em that, Travis?
{43780}{43848}I hadn't thought this was generally known.
{43852}{43896}It isn't yet.
{43900}{44016}Not till Austin separates|the sheep from the goats.
{44020}{44112}Not till he decides who's on the right side.
{44116}{44160}Republic.
{44164}{44208}I like the sound of the word.
{44212}{44280}It means people can live free...
{44284}{44328}{y:i}...talk free...
{44332}{44376}{y:i}...go or come, buy or sell...
{44380}{44448}{y:i}...be drunk or sober.|However they choose.
{44452}{44519}Some words give you a feeling.
{44523}{44591}Republic is one of those words that...
{44595}{44663}...makes me tight in the throat.
{44667}{44735}Same tightness a man gets when his...
{44739}{44807}{y:i}...baby takes his first step or...
{44811}{44879}{y:i}...his first baby shaves...
{44883}{44975}{y:i}...and makes his first sound like a man.
{44979}{45115}Some words can give you a feeling|that makes your heart warm.
{45123}{45216}Republic is one of those words.
{45363}{45424}Crockett!
{45483}{45550}I have, I believe, learned|two things about you.
{45554}{45598}Worthwhile, I hope.
{45602}{45718}You're not the illiterate country bumpkin|you would have people believe.
{45722}{45814}You speak an excellent and|concise English when you wish.
{45818}{45862}The... uh... bad grammar is a pose.
{45866}{46030}A fella has to do a lot to get elected to|Congress. I've kissed many a baby, too.
{46034}{46150}The other is that you came|to Texas to fight with us.
{46154}{46222}Don't tell my Tennesseans that.
{46226}{46342}They think we came south|to hunt and... get drunk.
{46346}{46413}Whoo-hoo-hoo!
{46442}{46555}They... uh... seem|to have accomplished that.
{49319}{49411}Good evening, my almost-vanishing lady.
{49415}{49483}Puedes irte, Juan.|- Sí, Señor Sand.
{49487}{49530}{y:i}Trae el equipaje.
{49534}{49602}Incredible! I arranged for this carriage...
{49606}{49674}I would be heartbroken|if you left Bexar just now.
{49678}{49746}Even more so if you left|with my team of horses...
{49750}{49818}...which would bring|a pretty penny in these times...
{49822}{49949}{y:i}...with two factions|buying anything on four legs.
{50326}{50370}Do you have business here?
{50374}{50418}I promised Mother.
{50422}{50466}Your mother?
{50470}{50537}Pray to the North Star.|Ten minutes every night.
{50541}{50635}A long line of star-worshippers.
{50661}{50729}It keeps the rheumatiz away.
{50733}{50801}It seems to me you're looking for trouble.
{50805}{50862}It do?
{50949}{51041}Let's go upstairs. Unless you prefer|discussing your business...
{51045}{51113}{y:i}...in front of every drunken loafer in Bexar.
{51117}{51184}Ándala, pues!
{51453}{51496}I suppose that overdressed ignoramus...
{51500}{51568}{y:i}...is one of the riffraff|here to resist Santa Anna.
{51572}{51688}They'll find graves and nothing else.|Santa Anna will sweep across...
{51692}{51760}Overdressed?|I paid good money for these clothes.
{51764}{51818}Why?
{52052}{52122}Lady's luggage.
{52388}{52432}Gratuity for the boy. You forgot.
{52436}{52494}Dinero.
{52747}{52847}Son, I guess he isn't gonna tip you.
{53155}{53199}Another thing I promised Mother.
{53203}{53319}Never to get in situations|where people pointed guns at me.
{53323}{53367}Ma'am, it is possible that I am mistaken...
{53371}{53463}{y:i}...but it seems to me you find this|gentleman's company distasteful.
{53467}{53510}Tell him to get out.
{53514}{53606}Thank you, sir, but there is no way|in which you could be of help.
{53610}{53734}And I am in no danger.|- I bid you good night, ma'am.
{53778}{53856}Gratuity for the boy.
{54018}{54093}Your property, sir.
{54186}{54261}Muchísimas gracias!
{54737}{54829}We are guaranteed the protection|of the generalissimo himself.
{54833}{54901}Ah, but please don't misunderstand me.
{54905}{54949}{y:i}I don't want all of your lands.
{54953}{55021}Half will be sufficient for me.|I'm no glutton.
{55025}{55117}{y:i}¡Tú eres el más digno|descendiente de la liga de fuerzas!
{55121}{55165}{y:i}¡El más bajo de los cobardes!
{55169}{55237}{y:i}¿Pero cómo es posible que|tengas tan poca dignidad?
{55241}{55309}{y:i}¿Cómo es posible que tengas|tan poca vergüenza?
{55313}{55429}Easy, Graciela, easy! I speak your|language, but that's too fast for me.
{55433}{55524}Though I dare say|I'm better off not understanding.
{55528}{55572}You actually wanted me to agree to this?
{55576}{55644}This atrocity?!
{55648}{55716}I actually did and I actually do.
{55720}{55812}You're an educated woman, Graciela.|Intelligent.
{55816}{55884}Is there any other way|to restore your family properties?
{55888}{55993}Santa Anna's administrators rule Potosí.
{56008}{56052}You... you expect me to marry you...
{56056}{56196}{y:i}...with my father and four brothers newly|buried in Potosí... and my husband?
{56200}{56268}I expect it because it is the logical course.
{56272}{56316}To marry you? Logical?!
{56320}{56364}Of course!
{56368}{56412}I am acceptable to Santa Anna.
{56416}{56531}If he should be defeated, I will manage|to become acceptable to his successors.
{56535}{56579}Oh...
{56583}{56699}That's the trick. To be acceptable|to the powers that be.
{56703}{56771}Let's not pretend|you're a broken-hearted widow.
{56775}{56819}You barely knew the man.
{56823}{56915}The marriage was as much arranged|as this one would be.
{56919}{57011}Your family picked him up.|- That's the way of my people.
{57015}{57035}You'll say yes.
{57039}{57129}It's your only possible path.
{57135}{57203}Like all women,|you'll postpone the decision.
{57207}{57285}But you will say yes.
{58334}{58426}Forgive me, ma'am, but I was|having a smoke out on that gallery...
{58430}{58521}{y:i}...and I couldn't help but overhear...|I wasn't eavesdropping.
{58525}{58665}But it rankles me when somebody tries|to force somebody to do something.
{58669}{58785}You haven't seen me before tonight,|but I am offering you my services.
{58789}{58857}If that fella's making you stay in Bexar...
{58861}{58929}{y:i}...I'm ready, willing and able|to provide you...
{58933}{58977}{y:i}...a transport to wherever you wanna go.
{58981}{59073}And on the other hand,|if you choose to stay in Bexar...
{59077}{59223}{y:i}...I'm ready, willing and able|to see that he don't bother you.
{59245}{59361}Would you answer one question with|complete honesty, Mr... Tall American?
{59365}{59433}Ma'am, only modesty|restrains me from telling you...
{59437}{59552}{y:i}...that I am widely known|for my truthfulness.
{59556}{59696}Would you so quickly offer to defend me|if I were 60 years old and wrinkled?
{59700}{59768}Or is it because I am young and a widow...
{59772}{59898}{y:i}...and you are far from home|and your loved ones?
{59964}{60051}But thank you, anyway, sir.
{60084}{60128}In any event...
{60132}{60248}{y:i}...this is a matter in which|no outsider could help.
{60252}{60320}Mr Tall American!
{60324}{60440}I do believe that a woman in trouble,|even though 60 and wrinkled...
{60444}{60535}...could turn to you for help.
{60539}{60613}Good night, ma'am.
{61307}{61369}¡Adelante!
{62266}{62318}Ha!
{62482}{62525}Well, thanks, friend!
{62529}{62621}If you don't insist on having them|to yourself, I'll give you a hand.
{62625}{62697}Pleasure, friend.
{62721}{62813}You must be Jim Bowie.|The size and the shape is as described...
{62817}{62885}{y:i}...and this knife is certainly|everything I heard it was.
{62889}{62957}I'm Bowie.|- I'm Davy Crockett.
{62961}{63029}Well! I've heard a lot about you!
{63033}{63101}I've heard a lot about you, too.
{63105}{63149}I'd admire to buy you a drink,|or eight or ten.
{63153}{63224}Oh... Excuse me.
{63249}{63317}Did you have some trouble with Emil Sand?
{63321}{63365}Who's Emil Sand?|- Merchant.
{63369}{63437}Tall fella? Butter-coloured hair?|- That's him.
{63441}{63508}I've had some words with him.|Intend to have some more.
{63512}{63580}How about that drink?|- Honoured, Congressman Crockett!
{63584}{63727}Please, Jim! Don't call me that!|I've been trying to live it down.
{64136}{64204}Here's your extra coat, Davy. And a jug.
{64208}{64276}Thoughtful. You'd better|get some sleep, Smitty.
{64280}{64324}I'm not tired.
{64328}{64372}It's Mexico. Exciting night.
{64376}{64444}Yeah, well, you'd still better get some sleep.
{64448}{64515}All right, Davy.
{64519}{64539}Night, Smitty.
{64543}{64638}Good night, Colonel Bowie... Jim.
{64735}{64803}Took a long time for|this night to get unexciting.
{64807}{64872}It sure did.
{64879}{64947}'Tis a mighty pretty one though.
{64951}{65043}I understand you moved down here|lock, stock, and barrel, Jim.
{65047}{65163}I didn't plan on moving.|Came for a visit and stayed.
{65167}{65259}I gather you like it.|- Oh, Davy! If you only knew Mexico!
{65263}{65307}It's wonderful!
{65311}{65403}I thought she was a burnt-over|desert most of the time.
{65407}{65498}Nah... Most northerners|think that. It ain't so.
{65502}{65570}Big valleys between high mountains.
{65574}{65666}Just everything a man could want|in the way of country.
{65670}{65774}For looking at or... or for growing on.
{65790}{65834}But mostly...
{65838}{65906}Mostly it's the people, Davy.
{65910}{65974}They got...
{65982}{66026}This is kinda hard to explain, but...
{66030}{66122}{y:i}...they got courage and they got dignity.
{66126}{66194}They ain't afraid to die.
{66198}{66314}What seems most important to me|is that they ain't afraid to live.
{66318}{66458}Today is important to them,|not the dollar tomorrow might bring.
{66462}{66529}I suppose the Yankee says that's lazy.
{66533}{66626}Me? I say it's a way of livin'.
{66653}{66697}And the womenfolk!
{66701}{66745}Well, Davy...
{66749}{66817}I figured you favoured the Mexican ladies.
{66821}{66889}They tell me you married one.
{66893}{66937}Yeah, I... uh...
{66941}{66998}I did.
{67013}{67075}I... uh...
{67085}{67129}Well, Davy, I...
{67133}{67297}I just ain't got, you know, your way|of putting things into... into words, but...
{67301}{67378}I got a fine family.
{67397}{67441}A wonderful wife and...
{67445}{67525}{y:i}...two fine boys.
{67540}{67632}I guess I'm what you'd call a lucky man.
{67636}{67728}Now, that ain't a bad stab|at putting it into words.
{67732}{67891}I, uh, sent them up to Coahuila with|all the trouble around here, you know...
{67948}{68016}May I speak privately with you, sir?|- Sure, but...
{68020}{68088}Aren't you Señora de López?|- Señor Bowie, I'm sorry.
{68092}{68184}I did not recognise you.|- This place ain't fit for...
{68188}{68232}I know. But the matter is urgent.
{68236}{68304}Could I have a few private words|with this gentleman?
{68308}{68352}Sure. Excuse me.
{68356}{68400}I'll be inside, Crockett.
{68404}{68465}Crockett?
{68476}{68519}You are the famous David Crockett?
{68523}{68567}Well, I'm Crockett.
{68571}{68687}They named me Davy after an uncle|that didn't leave Pa the farm after all.
{68691}{68831}Mr Crockett, shortly after you left my|room I heard an altercation in the street.
{68835}{68927}I could hear the sound,|though I could not see from my window.
{68931}{68975}It sounded like a drunken brawl.
{68979}{69047}Well, sittin' right here I didn't hear a thing.
{69051}{69143}Well, anyway, I saw lights|in the old church...
{69147}{69215}{y:i}...and people moving about.|And one of them was Emil.
{69219}{69263}And... a thought came to me.
{69267}{69335}As you may know,|Colonel Travis has ordered...
{69339}{69431}{y:i}...all powder and ball|from the merchants of Bexar.
{69435}{69502}And he didn't find any at Emil's warehouse.
{69506}{69646}It's my opinion... it's all hidden|in the basement of that church.
{69650}{69694}And... Mr Crockett...
{69698}{69814}The defenders of Texas are going to|need that powder against Santa Anna.
{69818}{69910}And you're against Santa Anna?|- Bitterly. Of course.
{69914}{69958}And this... uh... Emil? He's for him?
{69962}{70006}Yes, he is.
{70010}{70078}Then, how did he figure you'd marry him?
{70082}{70150}Political arguments|don't flavour folks' supper.
{70154}{70270}Nevertheless, I am going to marry him.|Please let's not discuss it, Mr Crockett.
{70274}{70342}The name is Davy,|and I couldn't sleep nights...
{70346}{70414}Will you say goodbye for me to Mr Bowie?
{70418}{70462}Well, I...|- I can make my own way...
{70466}{70580}{y:i}...and I hope the information is helpful.
{70945}{70989}Something interesting, Jim.
{70993}{71109}Parson, round up a couple of the men,|fairly sober, and meet us out in the street.
{71113}{71181}Where are we goin'?
{71185}{71269}The church.|- Yeah, Davy.
{71449}{71493}Hey!
{71497}{71555}Parson!
{71568}{71684}Why'd you run off without me?|- I told him to stay behind. He's drunk.
{71688}{71756}Stick to the point.|Why'd you run off without me?
{71760}{71804}Jim, this is Beekeeper. Jim Bowie.
{71808}{71852}Hi.|- You can come along.
{71856}{71996}But hold your breath. Can they smell,|they'll be warned you're coming.
{72000}{72062}Excuse me.
{72527}{72609}Grab that torch.|- Yeah.
{72815}{72877}Excuse me.
{73510}{73554}Well! Here, Parson.
{73558}{73619}Yes, sir.
{73774}{73862}Rifles.|- Must be 50 of 'em!
{73918}{73962}Pólvora.|- That's gunpowder.
{73966}{74034}Let me take a look at that stuff.|- Watch it!
{74038}{74143}Stand back and stand still.|- Excuse me.
{74158}{74226}There must be a ton of it.
{74230}{74322}I'm sure gonna be looking forward|to seeing that soldier boy's face...
{74326}{74417}{y:i}...when we bring this in.
{76939}{77007}It's a beautiful morning, Davy Crockett.
{77011}{77078}It is that...
{77083}{77127}...María de López y Vejar.
{77131}{77175}My goodness! You remember all that?
{77179}{77295}Sure. I'm not as stupid|as I look from the outside.
{77299}{77367}What's Spanish for breakfast?|- Desayuno.
{77371}{77439}Let's take a paseado out|and get some desayuno.
{77443}{77510}Paseado?|- That means 'walk'.
{77514}{77582}That means 'have walked'.|But never mind. I'll get dressed.
{77586}{77654}Wait a minute.
{77658}{77702}First, write me a letter.
{77706}{77750}A letter?
{77754}{77836}In Spanish.|- Of course.
{77850}{77918}To whom is the letter addressed?
{77922}{77990}To the Honorable Davy Crockett Esquire.
{77994}{78062}You wish a letter written to yourself?|- Yep.
{78066}{78134}To the Honorable Davy Crockett Esquire...
{78138}{78254}...former Congressman of|the United States of America.
{78258}{78328}Esteemed sir...
{78426}{78500}Hurry it up there!
{78665}{78781}Seen Davy?|- Ain't nobody seen Davy. He ain't about.
{78785}{78890}First lie you've told today, Thimblerig.
{78905}{78949}Mornin', Davy!|- Howdy!
{78953}{78997}Say, Davy, what kind|of a load you got there?
{79001}{79069}Presents for some friends.
{79073}{79145}Let's go, Parson!
{79672}{79716}Halt! Who goes there?
{79720}{79764}Is that you, Bob?
{79768}{79836}Why, sure. Can't you see?
{79840}{79956}Then what kind of idiot nonsense|is this 'Who goes there'?
{79960}{80028}Well, Travis - Colonel Travis, that is -|he says that I should...
{80032}{80192}I don't care what Travis said. Open|the gate before I shoot you off that wall!
{80272}{80377}Sentry! Open the gate for Colonel Bowie!
{80631}{80699}Near a ton of good powder here, men!|Get it unloaded!
{80703}{80771}That long one there, he's Davy Crockett.
{80775}{80867}And three of his good men.|- Colonel Crockett.
{80871}{80915}Hello, Travis.
{80919}{80963}Looks like the answer to a prayer.
{80967}{81083}Colonel, I'd be pleased if you'd join me|in my quarters for some refreshment.
{81087}{81148}Proud to.
{81159}{81270}Oh, and you too,|Colonel Bowie, if you will.
{81495}{81562}I'm a stranger around these here parts.
{81566}{81634}What do you Texicans use|for drinkin' whiskey?
{81638}{81756}Drinkin' whiskey.|- You got manners or ain't you?
{81806}{81898}Captain Dickinson,|this is Colonel Davy Crockett.
{81902}{81946}Morning, Dick.
{81950}{82018}Oh, and this is my cousin Mrs Dickinson.
{82022}{82066}Colonel Crockett.|- Colonel Bowie.
{82070}{82138}Well, it's nice meeting you,|Davy Crockett.
{82142}{82186}I feel as if I know you already.
{82190}{82258}You see, part of my family|come from Tennessee...
{82262}{82378}{y:i}...and, well, your name is a household|word there. At least in our house it was.
{82382}{82450}Thank you, ma'am.|It's nice to be well thought of.
{82454}{82539}Mommy.|- Oh, yes, darling!
{82549}{82617}Oh! I've asked you|not to climb those stairs alone.
{82621}{82713}Well, who's this?|- You say hello to Colonel Crockett?
{82717}{82761}Hello.
{82765}{82833}Every size they get to|seems to be the most lovable.
{82837}{82927}Will you gentlemen excuse me?
{82933}{82977}Goodbye, Colonel.
{82981}{83025}Goodbye.
{83029}{83097}Kind of a shame|kids have to grow up into people.
{83101}{83214}It's good we're all here, gentlemen.|A cigar?
{83269}{83313}Please, make yourselves comfortable.
{83317}{83409}I have some news.|Fannin is doing well at Goliad.
{83413}{83457}He has mustered almost a thousand men...
{83461}{83552}{y:i}...and should be ready to move south|by the first of the week.
{83556}{83624}A thousand? It don't seem possible.
{83628}{83696}It does sound too good to be true,|I must confess.
{83700}{83744}But we can only admit|our doubts to each other.
{83748}{83840}In the privacy of a room|and not in front of the men.
{83844}{83960}As far as the volunteers are concerned,|we're sure Fannin has a thousand men.
{83964}{84032}I got a reputation for truth, Travis.|- I ain't.
{84036}{84104}Everybody says I'm a born liar.
{84108}{84224}But whether we talk out loud or quiet|don't seem to me the point right now.
{84228}{84320}The point is how many men has Fannin|and will he get here in time?
{84324}{84440}Whether he does or doesn't,|we'll be trapped here. And for no reason.
{84444}{84511}We should burn all of Bexar,|including this mission.
{84515}{84607}And annoy Santa Anna while he sweeps|north across the whole of Texas?
{84611}{84679}That's Colonel Bowie's theory!|- We could hit and run!
{84683}{84727}Jump him at every creek crossing...
{84731}{84799}You seem to forget one thing, Colonel!|That I command!
{84803}{84916}And I have already|decided against your plan!
{84947}{84991}Now...
{84995}{85039}Let us attack a more important problem.
{85043}{85111}Colonel Crockett's Tennesseans.
{85115}{85159}Will they fight, Colonel?
{85163}{85279}Last time I saw 'em they hadn't shown|any strong feelings against fighting.
{85283}{85375}Can you persuade them to come here?|- I can ask them.
{85379}{85471}And you're a very persuasive man|according to your reputation.
{85475}{85566}Build up the story that Fannin has|a thousand... no, two thousand men.
{85570}{85662}Play down the size of Santa Anna's...|- We've been through this.
{85666}{85734}He wants me to lie to my men, too.|Keep 'em here with lies.
{85738}{85830}Let the truth of Santa Anna's strength|be known and there won't be a dozen left!
{85834}{85926}You calling my boys cowards?|- Let us dispense with the pyrotechnics!
{85930}{86022}Remember this. My men are volunteers!|They're here because they wanna be!
{86026}{86155}But there's nothing to keep 'em|from gettin' outta here!
{86170}{86262}I'm aware that your men are militia.
{86266}{86310}And, like all volunteers, undisciplined.
{86314}{86396}Good day, Colonel Bowie.
{86577}{86717}Last night gave you a pretty good idea|of the discipline of my men.
{86721}{86813}Our position here is desperate.
{86817}{86954}And I feel sure that where Crockett leads|his men will follow.
{86961}{87005}Yeah.
{87009}{87139}That's a responsibility that's...|been kinda worrying me.
{87249}{87317}Thank you, gentlemen.|I'm gonna pass the word around.
{87321}{87413}What you Texans use for|drinkin' whiskey... is drinkin' whiskey.
{87417}{87508}And what's more important,|you got real good manners...
{87512}{87652}...seein' how you suffer the handicap|of having never been in Tennessee.
{87656}{87748}Davy, is it true that you fit|a four-day fight with Mike Fink?
{87752}{87820}Why, that's a blasted lie!
{87824}{87916}One of them stories|loose-mouthed people tell around.
{87920}{87964}Mike and me quit at sundown!
{87968}{88060}Wouldn't have been the fourth day|until, uh... next morning.
{88064}{88084}See you, men!
{88088}{88165}Let her rip, Parson!
{88615}{88659}Señora López.
{88663}{88707}Don Juan, this is Mr Davy Crockett.
{88711}{88755}I'm honoured.|- How do you do?
{88759}{88875}Señor Seguin is the alcalde... I mean,|the mayor of San Antonio de Bexar.
{88879}{88923}He's got a pretty busy town.
{88927}{88995}People are running like sheep|that have smelled a wolf pack.
{88999}{89067}I never said no such a thing!
{89071}{89187}When us took that powder in there, that|fella Travis asked if us Tennesseans...
{89191}{89259}{y:i}...was gonna join up with him. That's all.
{89263}{89331}He never asked us to fight his fight for him.
{89335}{89403}Have some breakfast.|- Breakfast?! Tortillas?
{89407}{89465}Tamale!
{89526}{89594}Never get burnt drinking this stuff.
{89598}{89690}Well, I only know part of Texas and|none of these Texicans is related to me...
{89694}{89762}{y:i}...so why should I fight for them?
{89766}{89834}Right. Ain't our ox that's gettin' gored.
{89838}{89930}Talkin' about whose ox|gets gored... figure this.
{89934}{90050}A fella gets in the habit of goring oxes,|whets his appetite.
{90054}{90122}He may come up north next|and gore yours.
{90126}{90226}Men, we're in a little fix, sort of.
{90246}{90338}The he-bull around here -|General Santa Anna. He's mad at us.
{90342}{90386}Yeah?
{90390}{90434}He's wrote us a letter.
{90438}{90482}I can't read it. It's in Spanish.
{90486}{90568}But the young lady will.
{90797}{90913}It is addressed to Davy Crockett and|the Tennesseans who accompany him.
{90917}{90961}Be it known:
{90965}{91057}You are interlopers in a country where|you are neither wanted nor welcome.
{91061}{91129}This is the order you are given.
{91133}{91225}Depart with all haste and at once,|because it has come to our attention...
{91229}{91345}{y:i}...that you are possibly considering joining|the rebels now skulking in the mission.
{91349}{91441}This is not your fight. Depart.
{91445}{91536}Should you fail to abide by this order...
{91540}{91608}{y:i}...I shall chastise you even unto death.
{91612}{91733}Signed: Generalissimo|Antonio Miguel de Santa Anna.
{91756}{91800}Huh!
{91804}{91872}Fella kinda fancies himself, don't he?
{91876}{91944}Sure does have a big-sounding name.
{91948}{92040}Givin' us orders. Who do he think he am?|Andy by God Jackson?
{92044}{92160}Riles me when somebody tells me|to go here or I can't go there.
{92164}{92208}I ain't never been run out of no place!
{92212}{92304}Except the time my old paw|kicked me over every acre...
{92308}{92376}{y:i}...of that half-section back there in Ohio.
{92380}{92448}But I was just a shirt-tail kid then.|My paw had big feet.
{92452}{92519}What do you say, Davy?|Are we gonna let this man...
{92523}{92591}{y:i}...tell us what we can or can't do?
{92595}{92731}Davy, maybe we'd better saddle up|and pay this fella a visit.
{92763}{92855}Do chastise mean what I think it do?|- It do.
{92859}{92975}Davy, let's do saddle up and go learn|that gentleman his manners.
{92979}{93095}We won't have to. He's wearin' out|horses comin' toward us.
{93099}{93167}Well, I guess we can't|stop him from coming.
{93171}{93239}But I reckon we can arrange|for him to limp going back.
{93243}{93359}I was thinking these Texicans|wasn't as neighbourly as they might be.
{93363}{93455}But here they've gone and arranged|a nice fight for us visitors.
{93459}{93550}One thing I oughta tell you.|Santa Anna never wrote that letter.
{93554}{93598}{y:i}I did.
{93602}{93670}Or rather... I had this lady here write it.
{93674}{93766}I was figuring how to tell you fellas|about this Texican hoedown.
{93770}{93886}I wondered what Santa Anna would've|said to us if he'd had a chance to say it.
{93890}{93958}Davy, I ain't never said|I ain't been whupped. I have.
{93962}{94054}But I give every one of them fellas|a chance to dig in and get the job done.
{94058}{94150}But I ain't never took nobody's word|that they was gonna chas...
{94154}{94222}Chastise.|- Chastise. Much obliged.
{94226}{94294}We're gonna stay, ain't we?|- I'm thinking it over.
{94298}{94366}What is there to think about?|You getting that old?
{94370}{94414}The man toed the mark and dared us!
{94418}{94509}Chastise, he said!|- That's right! Chastise!
{94513}{94581}But I wrote the letter!|- Don't you start weaslin'.
{94585}{94701}You said them'd be the words he'd write|if he was to write us a letter.
{94705}{94749}Well, gentlemen, you've convinced me.
{94753}{94797}We'll fight.
{94801}{94893}That's more like it!|- Now you're talkin', Davy!
{94897}{94941}First, the young lady and I|will take a pasear.
{94945}{95037}Gather up your possibles|and I'll meet up with you later.
{95041}{95148}Con permiso.|- Your Spanish is improving.
{95185}{95253}It kinda cheers me to see|the colonel with that lady.
{95257}{95349}Last couple of years he had me worried.
{95353}{95445}Lately he ain't been looking|at the girls like he was starved.
{95449}{95562}Being in Congress|has ruined many a good man.
{95712}{95780}All I hear is Crockett the bear-killer...
{95784}{95852}Crockett the Indian-fighter...
{95856}{95900}Crockett the brawler...
{95904}{95948}Crockett has brains.
{95952}{96020}Kept it hidden a number of years.
{96024}{96092}You like my Tennesseans, Flaca?|- Oh, yes.
{96096}{96188}Could strain 10,000|and never come up with 23 better.
{96192}{96308}Every one of those men has been|at my elbow, save the boy Smitty...
{96312}{96380}{y:i}...when some difficulty arose.
{96384}{96499}Some of them don't bathe as often|as polite folks would think necessary.
{96503}{96610}But every one of them smells sweet to me.
{96623}{96739}And I was the one that said|this country was burnt-over sand.
{96743}{96811}It's green and growing.
{96815}{96923}Like those green pastures they talk about.
{96935}{97038}Lord above! That's one beautiful tree!
{97606}{97650}This tree must've been growed...
{97654}{97790}...before man put his first|dirty footprints on this prairie.
{97846}{97963}Kind of a tree Adam and Eve|must have met under.
{98134}{98202}You know something, Flaca?
{98206}{98250}I guess I saw who knows how many trees...
{98254}{98346}...before I ever took|a long, thoughtful look at one.
{98350}{98512}Mostly I looked at a tree to see was there|a bear in it or an Indian behind it.
{98517}{98609}Davy, what's going to happen to us?
{98613}{98681}I mean, to you and me.
{98685}{98753}I'm gonna tell you something, Flaca,|and I want you to listen tight.
{98757}{98849}It may sound like I'm talking about me,|but I'm talkin' about you.
{98853}{98921}In fact, I'm talking about|all people everywhere.
{98925}{99017}When I came down here to Texas,|I was looking for something.
{99021}{99089}I didn't know what.
{99093}{99137}It seems like you added up my life...
{99141}{99281}{y:i}...and I'd spent it all either stomping other|men or in some cases getting stomped.
{99285}{99353}Had me some money|and had me some medals.
{99357}{99473}But none of it seemed a lifetime|worth the pain of the mother that bore me.
{99477}{99520}It's like I was empty.
{99524}{99568}Well, I'm not empty any more.
{99572}{99640}That's what's important.
{99644}{99688}To feel useful in this old world.
{99692}{99808}To hit a lick against what's wrong,|or to say a word for what's right...
{99812}{99904}{y:i}...even though you get walloped|for sayin' that word.
{99908}{100000}I may sound like a Bible-beater|yellin' up a revival at a camp meeting...
{100004}{100072}{y:i}...but that don't change the truth none.
{100076}{100144}There's right and there's wrong.|You gotta do one or the other.
{100148}{100216}You do the one and you're living.
{100220}{100383}You do the other and you may be walking|around, but you're dead as a beaver hat.
{100436}{100551}I'd hoped for a horse, but there's|nothing wrong with a good strong mule.
{100555}{100617}My things!
{100627}{100671}All my luggage is in the buggy!
{100675}{100719}Had my men take care of it.
{100723}{100850}Your geegaws may be rough-packed|but they're all there.
{100963}{101055}You are sending me away. You...
{101059}{101175}You talked about the fight|against evil but you...
{101179}{101247}You are sending me to safety.
{101251}{101319}Flaca, you have an important name.
{101323}{101391}You know a million words|and how they should be used.
{101395}{101510}I'm sending you to fight your war,|to talk up a howling mob.
{101514}{101605}I'll stay here and hit a lick.
{101634}{101678}I hope you can drive a mule.
{101682}{101726}His name's Jesús, they told me.
{101730}{101820}He seems a good, honest mule.
{101970}{102038}Maybe I'll never see you again.
{102042}{102110}If that's what's written,|that's what's written.
{102114}{102158}When it's time, it's time.
{102162}{102230}Talkin' only makes it the harder, Flaca.
{102234}{102278}So stir up that mule.
{102282}{102344}Davy, I...
{102665}{102755}You never pray, do you, Davy?
{102833}{102914}I never found the time.
{103504}{103576}Sir! Tennesseans.
{103672}{103740}Colonel Travis!
{103744}{103822}Crockett and his men.
{103888}{103932}Go down and open the gate.
{103936}{103980}I'll just holler down.
{103984}{104076}Your orders were to go down,|not holler down, Mr Dennison!
{104080}{104141}Yes, sir.
{104511}{104555}Crack shots, those Tennesseans.
{104559}{104651}Twenty times their number's|what we need, and more.
{104655}{104747}Oh, I'm sorry, Will. Such gloomy|remarks are for your ears alone.
{104751}{104861}Isn't that Bowie galloping up to catch 'em?
{104943}{105011}I can just hear him pleading his cause.
{105015}{105083}Crockett seems to me the type of man|that would choose Bowie.
{105087}{105155}What you mean is|he isn't the type of man to choose me.
{105159}{105251}Oh, Will. Depend on you|to say it the most brutal way.
{105255}{105335}Most facts are brutal!
{105423}{105491}Just look at that great knife fighter|yapping at Crockett.
{105495}{105562}Cut, slash, and run!
{105566}{105634}Let's get mounted. Cut, slash, and run!
{105638}{105682}Cut, slash, and run.
{105686}{105778}Cost Santa Anna a hundred troops|at every creek crossing...
{105782}{105826}...between here and the North.
{105830}{105898}Sounds reasonable the way you put it...
{105902}{105970}{y:i}...but Travis has a point, too.|Takes thinkin' on.
{105974}{105994}Hey, Jim!
{105998}{106042}Halt! Who goes there?
{106046}{106162}Bob, I swear I'm gonna shoot you|off that wall. Are you blind?
{106166}{106210}That's what I was told to holler every time.
{106214}{106282}Well, don't holler at me!
{106286}{106306}Idiot.
{106310}{106420}You think on it, Davy. You'll side with me.
{106621}{106665}What is it?
{106669}{106761}Tennesseans, Nell. 23 of 'em.|All the way from home.
{106765}{106857}Do you recognise any, Jocko?|Is my brother Malachi with them?
{106861}{106929}He was a fella to go|where there was trouble.
{106933}{106977}He was that.
{106981}{107025}But, Nell, you know Malachi was hung.
{107029}{107113}Or so some folks told us.
{107125}{107265}Colonel Crockett. I am glad you were able|to persuade your men to join us.
{107269}{107313}Well, they insisted, sort of.
{107317}{107385}Our heartiest welcome!
{107389}{107433}Ladies and gentlemen...
{107437}{107528}{y:i}...we are proud to welcome|these patriotic men...
{107532}{107624}{y:i}...who have travelled 1500 miles|to join us in our hour of need.
{107628}{107672}Sergeant Lightfoot!|- Yes, sir?
{107676}{107768}You will have your men|raise a cheer for our gallant allies...
{107772}{107840}...from the illustrious state of Tennessee!|- Yes, sir!
{107844}{107912}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{107916}{107960}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{107964}{108032}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{108036}{108128}Captain, you will attend to|the billeting of these men.
{108132}{108272}After you are quartered, I will take you|on a tour of the emplacements.
{108276}{108353}This way, gentlemen.
{108396}{108478}Crockett! Davy Crockett!
{108492}{108583}We're from Tennessee.|- Well, howdy, folks!
{108587}{108655}We seen you when you came|to Stink Wells...
{108659}{108703}{y:i}...to speak about that job for the Congress.
{108707}{108775}You shook hands with me.|- I'll do her again.
{108779}{108847}He didn't vote for you, though.
{108851}{108895}Other fella gave him four bits.|- I'm sorry.
{108899}{108991}Don't be. Glad there were|enough sensible folks like you...
{108995}{109039}{y:i}...to vote me out of that job.
{109043}{109135}Well, later on we'll have|a real old home talkfest.
{109139}{109293}Right now we've got to get quartered|and bedded down. Would you excuse us?
{109307}{109408}You should have voted for him, Jocko.
{109522}{109600}¡Soldados! ¡Soldados!
{109978}{110068}{y:i}¡Columna a la izquierda!
{110410}{110525}Of our 24 pieces of ordnance,|five are these six-pounders.
{110529}{110619}Something's stirring in town!
{110817}{110861}Ladies will take cover, please!
{110865}{110956}Men, to your battle positions!
{111489}{111556}¡Los documentos!
{111560}{111604}Los documentos.
{111608}{111729}{y:i}Teniente, cumpla con sus órdenes.|- Sí, señor.
{112280}{112348}Captain Dickinson,|are your men disposed?
{112352}{112429}At their posts, sir!
{112519}{112587}No one will fire unless I so order!
{112591}{112721}Those people are under|the protection of a flag of truce.
{112855}{112923}¡Columna alto!
{113023}{113139}From Generalissimo Antonio López de|Santa Anna, absolute ruler of Mexico...
{113143}{113211}{y:i}...to the rebel commander|who deems himself in command...
{113215}{113283}{y:i}...of the rebels occupying the mission.
{113287}{113331}Be it known:
{113335}{113403}The province of Mexico known as Texas...
{113407}{113498}{y:i}...has shown itself to be|in active and treasonous revolt...
{113502}{113570}...against the rule of|Generalissimo Santa Anna.
{113574}{113618}The generalissimo issues|the following order.
{113622}{113714}All occupants of the mission|will leave at once...
{113718}{113786}...leaving all arms|and ammunition behind them.
{113790}{113858}If this order is not followed with dispatch...
{113862}{113930}{y:i}...the generalissimo will reduce|the mission by assault.
{113934}{114027}There will be no quarter given.
{114222}{114266}{y:i}¡Columna a la derecha!
{114270}{114331}¡Marchen!
{114821}{114911}Well, what do you think, Jim?
{114941}{115081}I hate to say anything good about|that long-winded jackanapes...
{115085}{115211}{y:i}...but he does know|the short way to start a war.
{115756}{115821}The Sixth...
{115828}{115923}The Sixth Vera Cruzano Fusiliers.
{115996}{116088}They're bivouacking about|a mile south of our west bastion.
{116092}{116160}Light artillery, lancers, some engineers.
{116164}{116280}Not one unit of heavy assault troops yet,|and it still adds up to 2,000 men.
{116284}{116352}That'll be to our advantage, Dick.
{116356}{116448}That main body must be|strung out for miles.
{116452}{116543}The assault infantry,|heavy artillery and supply trains...
{116547}{116591}They won't be here for four or five days.
{116595}{116663}The actual battle can't start until then.
{116667}{116759}Oh, there'll be an occasional sortie|feeling out our defences.
{116763}{116879}But they won't commit to an attack until|Santa Anna is here with his main force.
{116883}{116986}Then what?|- Then Fannin will be here.
{117123}{117191}More troops arriving every hour.
{117195}{117263}Prettiest army I ever did see.
{117267}{117311}Yeah.
{117315}{117383}If I take my men out, do you go with me?
{117387}{117479}Davy, you know this old mission|can't stand up to Santa Anna's army.
{117483}{117550}My way's the only way.|- Travis says that Fannin's coming.
{117554}{117713}Travis says! I wouldn't take Travis's|word that night's dark and day's light.
{117770}{117790}Blowin' on a horn. That's all.
{117794}{117862}Chicken in the bread bag,|pickin' up the corn. That's all.
{117866}{117934}Flies in the buttermilk.|Shoo, fly, shoo! That's all.
{117938}{118006}Ants in the sugar bowl.|Two by two. That's all.
{118010}{118126}I carried twice as much!|- You're twice as big.
{118130}{118207}Patrol's in trouble!
{118657}{118701}Doggone it, Beekeeper!
{118705}{118797}I thought you wasn't gonna open|that corn liquor till nightfall!
{118801}{118893}It's only a half-hour till dark.
{118897}{118965}Besides, it's my keg, ain't it?
{118969}{119013}Well, all right. Give me some of that stuff!
{119017}{119085}I'm so scared I could drink all of it!
{119089}{119133}Maybe I will.
{119137}{119205}What'd you see, Irish?
{119209}{119277}More than I wanted to, Jim.|A lot of men arriving.
{119281}{119373}And they got the durned|blastedest cannon ever I did see!
{119377}{119454}Something like this.
{119568}{119636}12 or 14 foot long maybe!
{119640}{119708}He sure draws pretty, don't he?|- Frightening!
{119712}{119780}12 or 14 feet long. Are you sure, Irish?
{119784}{119828}Well, yeah...|- Finn!
{119832}{119876}Yes, sir!
{119880}{119972}You were ordered to report to me,|not to hold lecture courses. Get up here!
{119976}{120081}All right, Will... uh... Colonel Travis.
{120144}{120188}Hey, Travis! With a cannon like that...
{120192}{120308}{y:i}...them Santa Anna fellas can just sit up|there and give us what for, can't they?
{120312}{120380}There's no such cannon|in the North American continent.
{120384}{120452}They have some in Europe,|according to last reports.
{120456}{120547}Acting Lieutenant Finn is exaggerating.
{120551}{120609}¡Fuego!
{120743}{120873}She's a big one, Davy!|And she's shooting from over here!
{121055}{121123}Battery One! Is your gun ready?
{121127}{121171}We're primed and ready, sir!
{121175}{121219}Give it full elevation!
{121223}{121284}Yes, sir!
{121367}{121411}The gun is ready, sir!
{121415}{121470}Fire!
{121654}{121757}Kinda short there, Colonel, Mr Travis!
{121870}{121986}I'm sure I'm glad I seen that there cannon|sitting out there on that prairie.
{121990}{122058}For a minute I thought|they was shooting at us...
{122062}{122106}{y:i}...from one of them countries|over in Europe.
{122110}{122154}Oh, my goodness!
{122158}{122210}No!
{122230}{122298}Oh, no! They wouldn't dare!
{122302}{122412}Man, that ain't no fair way to fight a war!
{122517}{122609}Well, I guess we'd better do|somethin' about that, Crockett.
{122613}{122681}Plain as can be.|- About an hour after dark?
{122685}{122729}Good.
{122733}{122777}Thimblerig, 15 men.
{122781}{122825}Right after dark.
{122829}{122891}All sober.
{123141}{123161}Boo!
{123165}{123233}Halt!|- I lost the bet.
{123237}{123305}I bet my friends I could sneak up|on you without you hearing me.
{123309}{123420}Friend, you like to got a hole in your head.
{123429}{123481}Ha!
{123500}{123634}Tie him loose.|- Kick that fire out and kill our silhouette.
{123644}{123738}Let's go. Company One, let's go!
{124052}{124096}Everything set?|- Yes, sir.
{124100}{124144}All right. It's time, men.
{124148}{124240}Open the gate!|- Colonel Travis, sentry here!
{124244}{124312}Somebody jumped me!|- I'll say they did!
{124316}{124432}Shoved me down, tied me up, and|some of them stepped on me goin' by.
{124436}{124551}And never so much as|a by-your-leave from every one of them.
{124555}{124613}Dammit!
{124675}{124743}Return to your posts.|- Yes, sir.
{124747}{124817}Close the gate!
{124867}{124935}Well, you'd better get|your men mounted, then.
{124939}{125007}See if you can give them any help.|- Yes, sir.
{125011}{125092}Detail! Stand to horse!
{125634}{125704}Get the powder!
{125874}{125984}Where's the mud?|- It's comin'. Here it is.
{127025}{127093}¿Qúe es?|- ¡Es un cañon!
{127097}{127165}Clear out! I'll cover!
{127169}{127243}You heard the man.
{127361}{127472}Come on, kid! Get outta here!|- I can shoot.
{127504}{127611}Golly! What a gun!|- Go on! Grab a horse!
{127792}{127859}Cannon party!
{127864}{127932}No one will fire until|you can identify your target!
{127936}{127997}Yes, sir!
{128104}{128211}Let's give 'em a hand, boys! Knock on it!
{128559}{128627}Pick 'em up! Pick 'em up!
{128631}{128744}Everybody rides double!|Come on! Pick 'em up!
{129255}{129385}Hold the gate! Hold the gate!|- Somebody's still outside!
{129542}{129610}Close the gate!
{129614}{129658}Good work, Smitty!
{129662}{129730}We never missed you.|Good thing the kid did.
{129734}{129778}That horse folded with me.
{129782}{129826}You all right, Jim?|- Sure.
{129830}{129898}Oh, Mr Smith! You've been hurt!|- Oh, it's all right.
{129902}{129970}Let's take a look at that.|- Doctor!
{129974}{130018}Mm. No bones broken.
{130022}{130090}All you need is a little|Doctor Beekeeper's fix-all.
{130094}{130155}See? I...
{130190}{130234}Pretty close.
{130238}{130354}Bowie?|- Oh, he's all right. Turned a horse over.
{130358}{130402}Jethro?|- Yes, sir.
{130406}{130497}Tell Colonel Bowie|I wish to speak to him at once.
{130501}{130545}Yes, sir.
{130549}{130617}Over here, where we can|have a little privacy.
{130621}{130682}Yes, sir.
{131077}{131164}Post this area.|- Yes, sir!
{131245}{131337}Will, considering the way|things turned out, I...
{131341}{131422}Dick, leave this to me.
{131940}{132008}Colonel Bowie.
{132012}{132125}I have had just about|enough insubordination.
{132132}{132176}You have?
{132180}{132248}All right. Let's get to it. When and where?
{132252}{132320}I hear you're a good shot,|so let's choose pistols.
{132324}{132392}I assumed you would choose|the ruffian's knife.
{132396}{132440}Gentlemen, I beg...|- Dick, act for me!
{132444}{132488}Time?
{132492}{132587}I suggest after this war is over.
{132611}{132655}Yes.
{132659}{132727}The minute...|the very minute this war is over.
{132731}{132799}Jim?|- That's fine with me.
{132803}{132871}One last word, Bowie.
{132875}{132919}This evening's episode...
{132923}{133015}By going on a mission without orders|you endangered this command.
{133019}{133087}If it had not been for|the intervention of Captain Dickinson...
{133091}{133183}{y:i}...a large number of volunteers|would now be dead out there...
{133187}{133231}...instead of at their posts in here.
{133235}{133327}I demand your word of honour that|there will no repetition of such conduct.
{133331}{133447}Or else I shall be forced|to order your arrest.
{133522}{133583}Travis...
{133594}{133724}Don't you worry any more|about arrest or insubordination.
{133738}{133833}I take my people out at daybreak.
{133978}{134046}Colonel Travis...
{134050}{134094}I'm an old man...
{134098}{134182}{y:i}...but you're wrong.
{134266}{134334}That Jethro...
{134338}{134382}Reminds me of a story...
{134386}{134430}Please, Crockett!
{134434}{134501}No homespun wisdom.|No cracker-barrel philosophy.
{134505}{134644}None of the backwoods wit|for which you are famous. Good night!
{134649}{134717}You'd better slack off on me, mister.
{134721}{134813}This code of honour business|doesn't bother me a bit.
{134817}{134885}When there's trouble|I come from any direction...
{134889}{134933}{y:i}...as sudden and surprising as I can.
{134937}{135029}My only concern here is 23 Tennesseans.
{135033}{135149}So you'd better let me know|what's in your mind.
{135153}{135277}I'd have thought that would|have been obvious to you.
{135321}{135389}It's as simple as this.
{135393}{135461}There's Santa Anna with 7,000 men.
{135465}{135532}Up here is the Sabine River.
{135536}{135580}Somewhere around here...
{135584}{135652}{y:i}...Sam Houston is trying|to organise an army.
{135656}{135748}And right in between... is the Alamo.
{135752}{135868}Santa Anna can't go around and leave|a fort along his lines of communication.
{135872}{135916}He must reduce the Alamo by storm.
{135920}{136012}Every minute of time|we buy for Sam Houston...
{136016}{136084}{y:i}...is another precious minute|in the life of Texas.
{136088}{136180}And nobody is ever going to say|that William Barrett Travis...
{136184}{136276}{y:i}...did not buy every minute possible.
{136280}{136348}Makes sense.|Why didn't you tell Bowie that?
{136352}{136420}A commander does not have|to explain his every decision.
{136424}{136492}You explained to me.
{136496}{136539}I have great respect for you, Crockett.
{136543}{136659}But I have none for that|knife-fighting adventurer.
{136663}{136755}I figured any fella that shouldered|a gun was deserving of respect.
{136759}{136851}But then I'm not... a real soldier.
{136855}{136923}I never fought anybody but Injuns.
{136927}{136995}Less'n you count the British.
{136999}{137060}Crockett.
{137119}{137211}I must ask you to forgive|my rudeness earlier on to you.
{137215}{137310}I'm an easy forgiver... at times.
{137335}{137410}Good night, Travis.
{137838}{137930}Crack out a couple of jugs|and bring that guitar.
{137934}{137978}What are we gonna do, Davy?
{137982}{138043}Serenade.
{138342}{138362}Well...
{138366}{138458}I hope you told that long-winded idiot|what you think of him.
{138462}{138596}I'm not rightly sure what I think of him.|- What's all this?
{138605}{138721}Well, I figured we'd crack a jug|and tell each other our troubles.
{138725}{138769}Now wait a minute, Crockett.
{138773}{138841}Don't try your winnin' ways on me.|My mind's made up.
{138845}{138913}Well, we can have a farewell drink.
{138917}{138961}You mean you're stayin'?
{138965}{139033}That's what I figure, Jim.
{139037}{139105}All right. We'll have a drink or two or ten.
{139109}{139177}But you ain't gonna get me drunk|and change my mind.
{139181}{139249}Of course not!
{139421}{139465}Water patrol! Let's go!
{139469}{139536}Rise and shine! Up and at 'em!
{139540}{139584}Beekeeper, come on! Show a leg!
{139588}{139632}Get out of there!
{139636}{139704}Thimblerig, come on! It's your duty.
{139708}{139776}It's your duty!|- You don't have to wake us all!
{139780}{139903}I'll get 'em up, Sergeant.|- Thanks, Parson. Thanks.
{139924}{139968}Hey!
{139972}{140064}Two dollars American|if you take out my patrol.
{140068}{140160}Two dollars? This morning|I wouldn't take your patrol for ten.
{140164}{140268}I would!|- Got yourself a deal, Scotty.
{140356}{140467}Well, Davy, it looks like you done it again.
{140500}{140557}It do.
{140571}{140672}And Bowie?|- Looked like a tie to me.
{140787}{140849}Your duty!
{141554}{141622}Good morning, Colonel.|He's still sleepin'.
{141626}{141719}I'll take care of that, Jethro.
{141770}{141814}Aaagh!
{141818}{141872}Hey!
{141938}{141982}Ow!
{141986}{142047}Crockett!
{142058}{142119}Crockett!
{142202}{142294}Crockett, what the devil...|- Good morning, Smitty. Doc.
{142298}{142342}Davy.|- Good morning.
{142346}{142401}Well!
{142418}{142486}You got yourself famous.|Now when they talk about Jim Bowie...
{142490}{142581}...they'll tell about the man that|pulled him out from under the troops.
{142585}{142629}Gee! Will they?
{142633}{142725}Jim, the kid wants to know|about that sand bar episode.
{142729}{142773}Oh, come on, Crockett!|- That's the truth.
{142777}{142869}He's never heard anything but hearsay.|- Gosh, yes, Mr Bowie!
{142873}{142989}All the fellas back home talk about...|- By the way, Smitty...
{142993}{143068}Say goodbye to Jim.
{143089}{143194}Are you going someplace, Colonel... Jim?
{143209}{143261}No.
{143281}{143373}No, I'm not goin' noplace.|That's just Crockett's idea of a joke.
{143377}{143421}Now you get well, Smitty, boy.
{143425}{143509}And thanks for your help.
{143784}{143876}What are you doin'?|- It was rumoured we were leavin'.
{143880}{144010}I'll tell you when we're leaving.|Get that gear put away.
{144024}{144085}Crockett.
{144695}{144763}By God, boy! You're bad-tempered!
{144767}{144835}Don't you ever try to make|a fool out of me again!
{144839}{144883}Once is enough.|- I make up my own mind.
{144887}{144955}Never thought otherwise, Jim.
{144959}{145075}I was wondering... You think there'd be|a mouthful of that corn juice left?
{145079}{145147}We could kinda|cut the tar out of our throats.
{145151}{145219}That's a great idea, Davy!
{145223}{145300}That's a great idea!
{145343}{145437}I still say you're bad-tempered.
{145558}{145616}¡Amigo!
{145630}{145698}Halt! Who goes there?
{145702}{145770}Don't shoot, amigo!
{145774}{145856}A message for Jim Bowie.
{145870}{145941}In the sombrero!
{146110}{146130}Jim!
{146134}{146252}Fella says there's a message|in this hat for you.
{146302}{146394}Huh! Kind of a strange way|to be sending messages, ain't it?
{146398}{146453}Yeah.
{146470}{146560}Maybe Santa Anna surrendered.
{147644}{147715}What is it, Jim?
{147764}{147832}I never... knew the night...
{147836}{147913}...could be so dark.
{147980}{148051}My... my wife...
{148100}{148157}She...
{148172}{148240}She's... dead.
{148436}{148518}I lived through it, Jim.
{148555}{148617}It's hard.
{148627}{148695}It was the plague.
{148699}{148770}The damn plague!
{148819}{148893}Oh, God, dear God!
{149107}{149151}Oh, Davy... she...
{149155}{149223}She was so small.
{149227}{149307}So tiny. So very tiny.
{149347}{149439}She wanted to stay in Bexar|to be near me, but...
{149443}{149534}{y:i}...I made her go to Coahuila.
{149538}{149606}I made her go!
{149658}{149729}My man Parson...
{149754}{149822}He's a kind of a preacher.
{149826}{149900}He keeps sayin'...
{149922}{150012}...little do we mortals know.
{150162}{150243}Hold your head up, Jim.
{150306}{150350}Colonel Bowie...
{150354}{150422}You've had a communication|from outside these walls.
{150426}{150470}This is against my orders.
{150474}{150572}What information have you received?
{150593}{150680}Bowie, hand me that letter!
{150761}{150838}You may die tonight.
{150857}{150925}That little lady, Jim.
{150929}{151003}She won't like it.
{151888}{151932}Colonel Bowie...
{151936}{152044}Please accept|my most profound sympathy...
{152056}{152172}{y:i}...and my regret for having|disturbed you at such a moment.
{152176}{152345}This in no way impairs your right to call|me on the field of honour at a later date.
{152511}{152603}But I wish to express my sorrow for you...
{152607}{152753}{y:i}...and present my apology for|being such a boor at such a time.
{152775}{152819}Travis...
{152823}{152910}You can't help bein' you...
{152943}{153040}{y:i}...and I can't help bein' me.
{153638}{153754}What's that all about, Sergeant?|- 32 cases hospitalised today, sir.
{153758}{153850}Well... Tell 'em to move over|after last night's party...
{153854}{153946}Oh, no, sir. Women and children.
{153950}{154031}Another officers' call.
{154046}{154090}See for yourself. It's all like that.
{154094}{154148}Sir.
{154166}{154228}Gentlemen.
{154238}{154306}Doctor.|- It's as simple as this, gentlemen.
{154310}{154378}I had 32 cases|of mild dysentery this morning.
{154382}{154474}I tested the salt pork barrel the rations|were issued from. It's tainted.
{154478}{154545}So is every other barrel in the warehouse.
{154549}{154569}Sergeant.
{154573}{154617}Barring the pork, I figure we have...
{154621}{154757}...three or four days' full rations|to serve to the garrison.
{154789}{154833}You see the dilemma, gentlemen.
{154837}{154881}We are almost out of food.
{154885}{155001}However, Santa Anna does not|suffer under the same handicap.
{155005}{155049}Therefore our course is obvious.
{155053}{155130}If you'll follow me.
{155149}{155247}{y:i}? Vuelve, el gitano, vuelve...
{155485}{155540}¡Olé!
{156132}{156224}I can think of more comfortable places|to watch that show from.
{156228}{156285}Quiet!
{156827}{156871}Dick.
{156875}{156936}Yes, sir?
{156971}{157039}It's a half-hour to daybreak.
{157043}{157087}Have your men stand to horse.
{157091}{157152}Yes, sir.
{159728}{159772}The night herders.
{159776}{159844}Two to each one of 'em.
{159848}{159916}Don't miss.|There'll be a lot of hungry kids.
{159920}{159964}Take 'em.
{159968}{160026}Smitty.
{160064}{160132}Grab a horse off that picket line for Smitty.
{160136}{160180}Get a good one.
{160184}{160228}Colonel Davy?
{160232}{160300}Can I ask you fellas|something face to face?
{160304}{160348}Sure thing, kid.
{160352}{160468}Are you really sending me because|I'm a good horseman like you said?
{160472}{160515}As I live and breathe!
{160519}{160587}You're smarter than Beekeeper|and you swim better than the gambler.
{160591}{160683}It ain't that you don't think I'd be|worth my salt when the fighting starts?
{160687}{160731}Smitty, let me tell you something.
{160735}{160851}Of all the men in this outfit, I'd pick you|to side me if the goin' was rough.
{160855}{160923}You see?|- Gee!
{160927}{161001}Get on this horse.
{161071}{161139}There's nothing out there,|kid, but dark.
{161143}{161217}Good luck, Smitty.
{161311}{161379}It'll take him quite a few days|to get to Houston.
{161383}{161463}That's what I figured.
{161790}{161834}The south side's all taken care of.
{161838}{161903}Get a horse.
{161934}{162019}Now all we can do is wait.
{162030}{162074}That's the hardest part.
{162078}{162142}It sure is.
{162198}{162263}Column halt!
{162294}{162338}Carry on, Dick.
{162342}{162386}Good luck.|- Thank you, Will.
{162390}{162458}Best of luck, Dickinson.
{162462}{162532}Forward, yo-ho!
{162989}{163119}If they don't shoot pretty quick,|we've got to go anyway.
{163397}{163467}Let's take 'em!
{165411}{165481}Hold your fire!
{165506}{165526}Hold your fire!
{165530}{165574}Pick your targets!
{165578}{165622}Fire!
{165626}{165693}Fire at will!
{165890}{165958}Second rank, fire!
{165962}{166040}Fall back! Fall back!
{166130}{166192}Fall back!
{166729}{166749}Fire!
{166753}{166797}Fall back!
{166801}{166845}Second rank!
{166849}{166893}Fire!
{166897}{166959}Fall back!
{167017}{167061}Third rank!
{167065}{167085}Ready?
{167089}{167144}Fire!
{167353}{167417}Cease fire!
{167640}{167684}Close the gate!
{167688}{167756}There's one thing for sure.
{167760}{167804}He's a bearcat for nerve.
{167808}{167852}I'm grateful for that.
{167856}{167948}I'd hate to look at a coward|over a duellin' pistol.
{167952}{168068}You're not much for this forgive|and forget business, are you, Jim?
{168072}{168124}No.
{168575}{168619}Beef for supper.
{168623}{168684}Yes, sir.
{168791}{168859}Hog never rightly could pass for meat.
{168863}{168924}But beef!
{169127}{169195}The big he-bull himself!
{169199}{169243}Let's go!
{169247}{169291}Ladies to cover!
{169295}{169369}Men to your posts!
{170110}{170154}Captain Dickinson.|- Yes, sir.
{170158}{170250}Order all men fed in relays.|Full issue of ammunition.
{170254}{170315}Yes, sir.
{170470}{170537}That's the best-dressed army I ever saw.
{170541}{170609}Fancy clothes don't make a fightin' man.
{170613}{170681}They're just off two years|puttin' down revolts.
{170685}{170763}They're fightin' men.
{171668}{171760}Generalissimo Santa Anna has just|arrived with the main body of his army...
{171764}{171808}{y:i}...and has only now become aware...
{171812}{171880}{y:i}...that there are women|and children in the mission.
{171884}{171952}He wishes that the ladies|receive his apologies...
{171956}{172024}{y:i}...and be informed he has|never attacked a position...
{172028}{172096}...without the enemy|being given the opportunity...
{172100}{172168}{y:i}...to evacuate women and children.
{172172}{172264}According, you have one hour in which|to evacuate these noncombatants...
{172268}{172336}{y:i}...who will be provided with transport...
{172340}{172408}{y:i}...to proceed to such destination|as is their choice.
{172412}{172503}Signed: Antonio López|de Santa Anna, ruler of Mexico.
{172507}{172572}Your answer?
{172675}{172743}My compliments to the general|for his gallantry.
{172747}{172845}We will evacuate our noncombatants.
{173131}{173199}Single men will remain at their posts!
{173203}{173329}Married men will arrange|transport for their families!
{174066}{174158}Sue, you'd better hurry.|- She won't go.
{174162}{174254}Save your breath, Will.|Your ever so persuasive breath.
{174258}{174302}All right, say it.
{174306}{174374}It's a sorry man|that can't make his wife obey.
{174378}{174446}You seem to forget, Dick,|that I too am married.
{174450}{174517}I've got to do what I think is the right thing.
{174521}{174613}I'm a soldier's wife.|My child is a soldier's child.
{174617}{174661}We'll stay.
{174665}{174709}Very well, Sue.
{174713}{174757}Dick.
{174761}{174829}Don't be angry with me.
{174833}{174877}I'm not angry.
{174881}{174943}I'm proud.
{175001}{175099}Dick, take your patrol.|- Yes, sir.
{175169}{175237}Married men, return to your posts!
{175241}{175285}Open the gate!
{175289}{175333}Captain Dickinson!
{175337}{175381}Escort! Forward!
{175385}{175442}Yo-ho!
{175624}{175740}Ma'am, I ain't got no woman to say|goodbye to. Could I tell you goodbye?
{175744}{175802}Surely.
{175816}{175887}Get up, boy! Ya!
{175984}{176028}Jocko, Nell.
{176032}{176094}It's time.
{176559}{176656}Go on, Jocko. Do the best you can.
{176967}{177026}I can't.
{177135}{177194}I can't.
{177303}{177347}I just can't do it, fellas.
{177351}{177419}Colonel Bowie.
{177423}{177467}This is a request and not an order.
{177471}{177538}But I suggest that,|as desperate as our needs are...
{177542}{177658}{y:i}...that family's needs are more desperate.
{177662}{177778}Get in that line, Jocko,|and move out with your people.
{177782}{177826}You can see how it is.
{177830}{177874}It's more than a man can bear.
{177878}{178018}She's never said a word of pity for herself|in the ten years she's been blind.
{178022}{178066}Will Travis!|Just who do you think you are?
{178070}{178234}Mrs Robertson, I can assure you that no|blame will attach itself to your husband.
{178238}{178330}Get movin', Jocko, or I'll help you|along with the toe of my boot.
{178334}{178402}Shut up, Jim Bowie!|And you and Travis listen close.
{178406}{178521}My man ain't goin' out. He's just as much|a man as either one of you. Maybe more.
{178525}{178641}In spite of he ain't rich like you, Jim,|or fancy educated like you, Will Travis.
{178645}{178689}Now, Jocko, you get back up on that wall.
{178693}{178785}Cos you're just as good as|any man that ever trod leather.
{178789}{178833}And it's your right.
{178837}{178953}And I can't see, but I'm just as good|as any woman in Texas.
{178957}{179025}And it's my right to go and leave you.
{179029}{179145}Now we've cuddled nice and said|all our goodbyes, but I'll say it again.
{179149}{179193}We'd be fools not to face it.
{179197}{179265}You're likely to go and get|yourself killed in this battle.
{179269}{179361}I don't know what you're going|to say at the gates of heaven...
{179365}{179481}{y:i}...but I'm gonna say no woman ever lived|had herself a better husband than you.

{183105}{183175}Hold your fire.
{183273}{183334}Take 'em!
{183920}{183964}Straight frontal attack!
{183968}{184108}We need more men up here!|I'll get some strength from Dickinson.

{185934}{186029}Hold your fire! They're retiring!
{186486}{186529}See did any of our boys get hurt.
{186533}{186673}I'll be below gettin' washed on|the outside and wet down inside.
{186677}{186758}We've been lucky today.
{186821}{186865}Check the damage.
{186869}{186960}Officers' call in ten minutes.
{186965}{187037}Bring on another.
{187972}{188064}Sure killed many a brave man today.
{188068}{188160}It's funny. I was proud of 'em.
{188164}{188280}Even while I was killin' 'em|I was proud of 'em.
{188284}{188352}Speaks well for men|that so many ain't afraid to die...
{188356}{188448}...because they think right's on their side.
{188452}{188517}Speaks well.
{188691}{188759}Post this area, Lightfoot.|- It's already done.
{188763}{188807}All right, Sergeant.
{188811}{188855}Report!|- 50 casualties.
{188859}{188927}28 dead, 22 wounded.
{188931}{188999}Morale... high.
{189003}{189095}Morale ain't gonna help us much|if Fannin don't get here... and quick!
{189099}{189143}Ow, Doc!|- Quit squawking.
{189147}{189215}You oughta be laying on your back.|You'll never walk.
{189219}{189311}Santa Anna didn't have much respect|for us today, and he got burned.
{189315}{189407}Now he's gonna be comin' at us|with a battle plan from all four sides.
{189411}{189526}We already been cut down by a third.|How long do you think we can hold out?
{189530}{189574}Santa Anna won't attack again today.
{189578}{189646}He'll clear the field of|all the dead and wounded.
{189650}{189718}Fannin will be here by tomorrow,|even without a forced march.
{189722}{189790}With his 500 men...
{189794}{189838}{y:i}...we can hold this fort for a month.
{189842}{189910}500? I thought it was a thousand.
{189914}{190006}500.|- Bonham's approaching, sir.
{190010}{190110}Good. Fannin should be close behind.
{190394}{190414}Well?
{190418}{190486}Colonel Fannin isn't comin'.
{190490}{190557}His men were ambushed. Murdered!
{190561}{190643}There won't be any help.
{190705}{190819}Have all volunteers|assembled in the compound.
{190921}{190965}Well, that's it.
{190969}{191037}I'm taking my men out.|Cut through to the North.
{191041}{191105}You comin'?
{191185}{191290}It seems like the better part of valour.
{191976}{192033}Men...
{192048}{192092}Jim Bonham has brought|news as sad as death.
{192096}{192188}Colonel Fannin has been ambushed.
{192192}{192272}We can expect no help.
{192288}{192376}I stay here with my command.
{192384}{192499}But any of you who wish to|may leave with all honour.
{192503}{192617}Failing reinforcements,|the Alamo cannot hold.
{192623}{192715}But do not go with heads hung low.
{192719}{192811}No man can criticise your behaviour.
{192815}{192899}Here on these ramparts...
{192911}{193027}{y:i}...you have bought a priceless|ten days of time for Houston.
{193031}{193099}You have bled the enemy army.
{193103}{193195}You are brave and noble soldiers.
{193199}{193267}Open the gate!
{193319}{193393}May God bless you.
{196220}{196290}Close the gate!
{196699}{196743}Hold up there, bub.
{196747}{196815}You're in dangerous territory.|Where you headin'?
{196819}{196911}I'm lookin' for General Sam Houston.|Got a message for him.
{196915}{196959}Well, you've come to the right place.
{196963}{197055}Corporal of the guard! Post No. 3!
{197059}{197127}What is it?|- He wants to see General Sam.
{197131}{197198}Come on, bub!
{197850}{197942}The lad has a message for the general.|- Yes, sir.
{197946}{198062}You'd better get down, and get yourself|some beans and a little sleep.
{198066}{198086}No, sir!
{198090}{198185}I've gotta get back to the Alamo.
{199001}{199069}Yesterday I read you Fannin's message...
{199073}{199189}...telling us he cannot reach|the Alamo in time.
{199193}{199293}Today I have this... from the Alamo.
{199337}{199381}They are surrounded...
{199385}{199477}{y:i}...and we can't help them.
{199481}{199524}Now, tomorrow...
{199528}{199659}{y:i}...when your recruits|start to whine and bellyache...
{199696}{199816}{y:i}...you tell them that 185 of their friends...
{199888}{199983}...neighbours, fellow Texicans...
{200008}{200124}{y:i}...are holed up in a crumbling adobe|church down on the Rio Bravo...
{200128}{200225}...buying them this precious time.
{200392}{200470}I hope they remember.
{200511}{200592}I hope Texas remembers.

{201950}{202011}What for?
{202022}{202090}I guess I've said some|pretty rude things to you.
{202094}{202185}Well, at least, I thought 'em.
{202190}{202234}You're a wonderful woman, Sue.
{202238}{202282}Forget it.
{202286}{202378}Dick, stay here as long as you can.
{202382}{202483}Probably won't need you till morning.
{202501}{202593}I've only added to your worries, haven't I?
{202597}{202688}I know I must be very selfish.

{204132}{204224}Well, I sure done a heap of things|I shouldn't have done.
{204228}{204316}Seemed urgent at the moment.
{204324}{204416}Got myself a heap of sins to answer for.
{204420}{204488}Wish I hadn't did 'em.
{204492}{204607}I reckon old Saint Pete's gonna slam them|Pearly Gates right smack-dab in my face.

{204827}{204919}Tales for children! Bunkum and bosh!
{204923}{204987}I say this.
{204995}{205039}I believe.
{205043}{205177}I can never find a way to argue down|you that don't believe.
{205187}{205255}But I believe in the Lord God Almighty...

{205355}{205471}And I believe that good|shall be triumphant in the end...
{205475}{205542}{y:i}...and that evil shall be vanquished.
{205546}{205614}I believe in a hereafter.
{205618}{205710}Me, too. I figure a man's|got to believe in those things...
{205714}{205806}{y:i}...does he want to believe in|the good things about man.
{205810}{205878}About his very own self.|The real good things.
{205882}{205969}Like courage and honesty...
{206002}{206063}And love.

{206218}{206279}Yes, sir.
{206482}{206586}This is somethin' I promised Mrs Bowie.
{206625}{206669}Know what it is?|- No, sir.
{206673}{206741}That's your freedom.
{206745}{206827}You're a free man, Jeth.
{206865}{206909}Thank you, sir.

{207273}{207317}Good luck, Jeth.
{207321}{207389}Thank you, sir.
{207393}{207461}Uh... Colonel Bowie,|you say I'm a free man?
{207465}{207508}That's right.
{207512}{207580}Well, if I'm free...
{207584}{207676}{y:i}...then I got a right|to decide what I'm gonna do.
{207680}{207796}Seems to me that's what|you men are fighting for.
{207800}{207880}So I... reckon I'll...

Hannibal!
Hannibal, Missouri!
Hannibal!
Hannibal, Missouri!
- Hannibal! Hannibal, Missouri!
- Hang fast on the bow!
- Next stop, St. Louis!
- Make room for the Hannibal passengers!
Now get them barrels marked "Cairo" up here!
Now move that Vicksburg cargo aft!
Here you are, sir.
Thank you.
All right, now put them Memphis boxes top of the Natchez cargo!
Get a move on, now! Hurry up, or we'll be a day late into New Orleans.
Oh, Huck!
Huck! Huck Finn!
Oh, it's you, Jim.
The Widow Douglas wants you, Huck.
She got supper on the table.
Tell her I stowed away on the Natchez Queen...
...and I'll probably be going to South America.
I can't tell the widow a stretcher like that, Huck.
They got a river in South America, Jim, and it ain't even been charted yet.
They need folks to help them.
Course, I'll have to go down the river to New Orleans first.
Wouldn't that be the beatenest, Jim?
New Orleans.
Wouldn't be nothing but trouble.
You'll have enough of that if you don't get home. You and me both.
Tell the widow and Miss Watson you just couldn't find me, Jim.
It's gonna be dark soon, Huck.
Yep.
It's beginning to smell like evening.
You'll be safe at the widow's.
That's the one place your pap won't come.
Your pap, Huck, he's looking for you.
- It's best we go, Huck. Come on.
- All aboard for St. Louis!
I sure would like to be going somewheres.
Come on, Huck. Let's go.
All aboard for St. Louis!
- He's barefoot.
- Oh, dear. Huckleberry.
Well, sit down before your food gets cold.
He'll put his shoes on as soon as he's finished his supper.
Amanda, I am not my sister's keeper, as the good book sayeth...
...nor am I the keeper of my sister's house, but...
That's right, Sarah, you're not.
Well, I suppose you can expect no better...
...for a young'un whose poor mother is lying dead in the churchyard...
...and his father's lying drunk by the riverside.
That's not Huckleberry's fault, Sarah.
He's not responsible.
Dear Lord, we thank thee for this food...
...and for all thy blessings.
And we beg thee to shine thy light before this sinner...
...and make him stop running around town barefoot...
...eating like a pig and not going to school.
Let him see the wisdom of education...
That he will be able to get a good, steady job when he grows up...
...preferably Tilden's tobacco factory or perhaps even a bank...
...if thee see fit.
We pray that he'll become a good and honorable man...
So that when the knell of doom sounds, he won't have to burn forever...
...in the eternal fires of hell.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Amen.
Huckleberry!
You're smoking.
Well, I got my shoes on, though, ain't I?
Smoking is a mean practice.
And besides, it's not clean.
Yes'm.
I guess I just wasn't made to be saved or civilized.
Huckleberry, you must try.
If not for my sake, for Miss Watson's.
She worries about you.
About what will become of you when you grow up, and...
Miss Watson loves you,
Huckleberry.
She'd be very unhappy in heaven without you.
Now, then, it's time for a growing boy to be in bed.
Come along.
Pap.
Hello, Pap.
Store-bought shoes, huh?
Think you're a good deal of a big bug, don't you?
- Maybe I am, maybe I ain't.
- Don't you give me none of your lip!
- This yourn?
- Yep.
- Can you read it?
- Not so good as I should, Pap.
Don't you "Pap" me.
You ain't no son of mine, wearing store shoes and reading.
And writing too, probably.
Not hardly.
Putting on airs.
Your ma couldn't read nor write.
Her folks couldn't, mine neither.
And I can't, but you think you're better than your own pa, don't you?
What is it? What's the matter?
I was afraid it would be you,
Mr. Finn.
Oh, "Mr. Finn," is it?
Well, now, ain't that highfalutin?
So that's where he gets his uppity ways.
- My poor lamb.
- And his loving hugs and kisses too, I see.
She don't mean no harm by it, Pap.
It ain't right...
...a boy living softer than his own pa.
I gotta have somebody to work and help take care of me. I'm a sick man.
Of course, if l... If I had a bit of money for medicine and such...
...I wouldn't have no need of the young'un.
How much do you want?
- Five hundred dollars.
- Five...
- But I'm a poor woman, Mr. Finn.
- Well, the way I see it...
...you're a woman of property.
That nigger will fetch 500.
- Perhaps even more.
- She can't, Pap. She can't sell Jim.
It ain't fair. Please don't make her do that, Pap.
The reading and writing weren't enough.
That weren't devilish enough.
- You made the boy an abolitionist!
- I ain't no abolitionist.
You shut up! Get over there!
Now, you've got till sundown tomorrow, widow woman...
...and I get the 500 or I'm taking him out of these parts forever!
Now, you know where my shack's at down by the river.
I'll be waiting. Come on.
Where's the victuals?
You said you was gonna bring us some.
Always thinking of yourself.
Well, I ain't brung any.
All's I could do to afford this jug.
Your dang loving widow lady...
...she thinks more of that slave of hers than she does you.
I waited all day for her.
Stood right down there in the center of town...
...just so she wouldn't have to come traipsing all the way out here...
...but she never showed up.
They're trash, rotten trash, all of them.
The more I see of the human race, the less I wanna have to do with them.
I never got nothing...
...nothing but a cuss word or a toe of a boot.
I never had one piece of luck.
And your mother...
Your mother didn't care.
Nor you neither.
You killed her.
You killed her just getting born!
Poor man left with a squealing baby that's gotta be brung up, with no wife to help him.
You'd think Providence would throw a creature like me...
...a little helping hand now and again.
I got nothing.
Nothing but to sit here and wait for the Angel of Death to come and get me.
And nobody cares, not one damn soul!
I swear to God, I don't know how they stood it.
Pap.
I care about you, Pap.
Pap?
You!
You...
I know you.
You're the Angel of Death...
...come to get me...
...but I ain't gonna let you.
I'm gonna kill you.
You won't come for me no more!
Pap, I ain't the Angel of Death.
I'm only Huck. Please, Pap.
I'll kill you.
No! No, Pap! No!
Don't come no closer, Pap.
I kill you, then.
As soon as you're dead, everything will...
...be all right.
That's right, Pap.
If I was dead...
...everything would just be sweet as pie...
...especially for me.
So I reckon I'll have to kill myself.
Blood.
Huck!
Huck!
Huck!
Somebody got my son!
My son!
Murder!
They drowned my young'un!
Murder!
Hello, Jim.
Glory be.
You's a ghost!
I ain't a ghost, Jim.
But you's dead.
Your pap come running into town, yelling that robbers killed you.
Well, I tricked it up so Pap would think I was dead, but I ain't.
Here. Touch me.
Go ahead, touch me.
It sure was a good trick, eh, Jim?
Oh, Huck, that was smart.
You smart, all right.
Thank you, Jim.
What is you gonna do now?
I'm going someplace where they ain't ringing a bell to get up by or eat by...
...and another one to go to bed by.
New Orleans, probably. Have to go there first to get to South America.
Got a canoe hid over there in a cove.
I'm gonna take her and float down the Mississippi past St. Louis, Cairo...
Cairo? Illinois?
Then to the big river and right south to New Orleans.
This raft can float you there better than a canoe.
I catched her off the river.
She sure is a beaut, Jim.
She'd be better for sleeping and keeping out of the rain if she had a wigwam.
Yep, a nice dirt floor and she'd be high and dry.
Huck, I got skillets, cups, pans and knives and everything.
All we need is just a little luck.
Where was you going, Jim?
I run away from the Widow Douglas.
Jim.
Well, she was gonna sell me so she could pay your pap.
You go back to her, Jim. She owns you, and what's right's right.
Besides, you'll get caught for sure, a slave alone on a raft.
I'd be safe, I was with a white man.
Or a white boy, even.
I couldn't help a runaway slave, Jim.
Why, folks would say I was no better than a low-down abolitionist.
I know, Huck. I know.
To starboard!
Current must have took the boy's body down thataway.
- They's looking for your body.
- They're looking for my corpse, all right.
Put in to shore! That Negro slave that killed him is probably on one of these islands!
They think you killed me.
Of course you didn't, because I ain't dead.
You better get. Take the raft.
- What about you?
- I could go with you, Huck.
I was going down to Cairo, Illinois, to step across into free territory.
What do you take me for, Jim, helping a runaway slave?
That just wouldn't be right.
I'm sure they're on this one.
Put in to shore.
I'm sorry, Jim.
You know I can't take you and all that.
You just wanna do what's right.
I admire you for that.
Thanks, Jim.
And when they get here, don't you worry about them finding out you ain't dead.
They can whup me or beat me or whatever they want to do.
I won't tell them you's alive.
I promise.
Jumping Jehoshaphat!
You's the only one that knows, ain't you?
Especially your pap, Huck...
I won't tell him especially.
Pap.
As far as me talking in my sleep, I'll go off somewhere by myself so nobody'll hear me.
You talk in your sleep?
That's a bad thing I do, but not too much.
I gotta take you with me, Jim.
- That wouldn't be right.
- Don't matter when you got no choice.
Leaving you behind just wouldn't be smart.
Now, come on, Jim.
All right, boys, come on!
Please, Jim, come with me.
If you think that's a smart thing to do, whatever you say is smart.
All right, let's go.
You got an uncommon level head for a white boy.
Thank you, Jim.
Here. Give me the pole, Huck.
You just leave this to old Jim.
You take the sweep, and let's go.
All we got to do now is keep from getting caught.
Look at the birds, Huck.
Ain't they pretty?
- Lookie there.
- I'm sure hungry.
- Sure hope we catch something.
- Yeah.
Ain't that a farmer's place over there?
Jim, if you take something, planning on returning it...
...it ain't stealing, it's just borrowing, huh?
No, but I'd rather borrow something off the river. It ain't safe to go ashore.
- Are you hungry or ain't you?
- I'm hungry.
All right. Let's go, Jim.
Come on, Jim.
Your worship, shall we?
Nothing here.
Somebody's been here.
Ain't but these left.
All the other eggs left's got chickens round them.
Yeah, but we don't want a chicken, huh?
But Pap always says,
"Take a chicken when you get a chance.
If you don't want it, there's always somebody who does...
...and a good deed ain't never forgot."
There's one over there.
Get him. Get him.
All right, you no-good, horn-toed weasels...
...come out and take it like men!
I'm gonna count to three!
One, two, three!
Your name Grangerford?
No, sir. Abner Williams is my name.
This is my lawful manservant here.
- We're on our way to...
- Williams?
Ain't heard that name around these parts.
Well, that don't hardly seem possible.
Grangerfords!
- You a Shepherdson?
- I'm only a boy.
I'd kill you anyway if you was a Shepherdson.
What you want to do that for?
On account of the Grangerford-Shepherdson feud!
Now, don't tell me you don't know what a feud is.
Well, a feud is like this.
A man has a quarrel with another man, and he kills him.
Then the other man's brother kills him.
And then all the brothers on both sides joins in.
And then all the cousins chips in.
By and by, everybody's all killed off.
Then there ain't no more feud.
- Get out of here!
- Huck, this ain't no place for us...
...when folks don't even know why they's killing!
Hold on there!
You don't want me. I ain't a
Grangerford nor a Shepherdson.
- Don't matter. You're a chicken thief!
- Don't shoot, mister!
Let's get out of here!
Look, Jim.
Let's go.
- Y'all get away from our raft!
- Oh, no. No, no.
Extend the hand of welcome to our guest.
- Him too?
- Why, of course. He is our guest.
If I had my way,
I'd let the both of you drown.
Reckon you got it backwards about who's guests.
- This here's our raft.
- Yes, and these here's our eggs.
As one man of the world to another, do us the honor of accepting our hospitality.
- Sure would go good, all right.
- Yeah.
Eggs a la Creole.
A specialty at the Hotel Creole Grande in New Orleans.
You've stayed there often,
I suppose?
- No, I ain't. Not yet, anyhow.
- You got to.
It's the only hotel in the Colonies that knows how to see to a gentleman's comforts.
Bed down there the next time you're in New Orleans.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Have your manservant pole us out from shore.
The smell of this ambrosia will fetch every gourmet in the neighborhood.
Go ahead, Jim.
Eggs a la creole, a royal repast.
Delicious.
Well, we'll be in Pikesville by midday tomorrow.
We've got business in Pikesville...
...family business.
Perhaps you'd care to run your lamps over this.
We come across it in a local journal.
I ain't too good at newsprint.
"As Mr. Peter Wilks, leading citizen of Pikesville, is seriously ill...
...he has asked his two brothers
Harvey and William...
...clergymen of Sheffield, England...
...and their 13-year-old nephew Percy to come and help him run his business.
Mr. Peter Wilks has not seen his reverend brothers in 28 years."
I reckon that tells it all.
Excepting who's the reverends?
We's the reverends.
Who in blazes did you think the reverends was?
Then where's your nephew Percy?
We lost poor Percy crossing the great Pacific Ocean from England.
A nasty accident involving a shark.
But I do believe he's been reborn!
Percy!
My name ain't Percy.
With him along, folks will know we're bona fide relations.
We's going to Cairo.
Piddling little stopover wouldn't hurt you none.
- We'd be ever so much obliged.
- What do you want to go to Cairo for?
There ain't nothing there but runaway slaves and them that's hunting them.
We got business there.
Why, of course, they got business there.
What sort of business would it be?
Family business, just like yours.
Williams is my name. Abner Williams.
This here's my lawful manservant, Jim.
We're on our way to claim a land grant that was given to me by the government...
...all on account of my brother Ned got scalped by the Paiute Indians.
- That's the business?
- That's right.
You see, my folks was powerful rich before they was all killed off in a feud.
What's he talking about?
Why, he's talking about fallen grandeur.
Right, boy?
- Yes, sir.
- The saddest state mortal man can sink to.
- You should know about fallen grandeur.
- I should?
Let us introduce ourselves.
This here is none other than a great nobleman...
...cheated of his rightful title.
He, gents...
...is the duke of Bilgewater.
- A duke?
I am?
He was untimely ripped from his cradle and was tossed into the world...
...to fend for himself at the tender age of 1.
I was?
The tragedy has chased the facts from his mind.
Poor little child.
Royalty. It don't hardly seem possible.
Whoever said the truth is a stranger to fiction knew his apples, all right.
Take myself.
You heard of the lost dolphin, son to Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette?
- Of course.
- I reckoned you had. I am he.
I'd be on the throne right now if I hadn't been snaked out of my title by the Corsican.
What's he talking about?
Well, he's just saying that he's the king of France.
- You are?
- I am...
...if justice ever gets done.
What do you say, boy?
Join the royal party, and there'll be a sizable piece of change forthcoming...
...upwards of $60.
Sixty dollars!
We's going to Cairo.
You'd be wise to heed the royal whim.
- Unless you wanna swim to Cairo.
- We'd be suspicious...
...of a boy and a manservant that would turn down $60 in currency.
What do you say, boy?
The decision's all yours.
- Happy to be of service, your kingship.
- "Majesty" will do.
"Kingship" ain't for but state occasions.
Huck, is they English reverends or foreign highnesses?
I swear, Jim, what you don't know about royalty would fill a book.
What these highnesses are doing are one of the things they do most of.
It's called "traveling incognito."
On to Pikesville, Bilgie, and a little child shall lead them.
Monstrous big sky, ain't it, Jim?
Did you ever see so blamed many stars?
Makes you wonder where they all come from.
You reckon the moon could have laid them?
I seen a frog lay near that many eggs one time.
I think we got nothing but trouble here, Huck.
Dog it, Jim. You gotta look on the bright side of things.
We's having an adventure.
Besides, one thing I learned out of Pap:
The best way to get along with them kind is to let them think they got you fooled.
I never seen nobody for praying like you, Jim.
You can't pray too much, not when you is a sinner.
You know it, and the Lord knows it.
You ain't a sinner, Jim.
What sin have you sinned, except for running away from the widow?
I sin, Huck. I sin big.
I sin the baddest sin as any man ever did, black or white.
Fiddlesticks.
You know my little girl, my little Elizabeth?
One time, when she was about 4 years old...
...she had a rough spell with that scarlet fever, but thank goodness, she got well.
One day, we was standing around in the cabin, and the door was open.
I said to her,
"Shut the door, baby."
She didn't do it.
I tell her again, and she never move.
She just kept standing there...
...looking up at me kind of smiling-like.
I say, "I'm gonna teach you to mind your daddy," and I fetch her a slap...
...across the side of her head that sent her sprawling.
And I stepped outside just to kind of cool off a little bit...
...and come back about 10 minutes later, and the door was still open.
The child was almost right in it...
...looking down at the floor and just moaning...
...and the tears were just rolling down her cheeks.
I was mad, and just as I started for her...
...along come a wind and shut the door:
Ka-blam!
And the child, she never move.
She didn't even budge.
Huck, she was stone-deaf.
Deaf and dumb from that scarlet fever, and I had been treating her so.
I bust out crying.
I grabbed her up in my arms and prayed,
"God Almighty, forgive me...
...because I can't forgive myself."
Huck, the Lord knows what kind of sinner I is.
He knows I don't deserve nothing but trouble.
Prosperous-looking village.
The leading citizen of such a town must be rich...
...beyond the avaricious dreams of Croesus himself.
Rich folks is suspicious.
Might just be a good idea to get a few facts on dear Peter Wilks.
- How you gonna do that, Your Majesty?
- Why, same way you get facts anywhere:
From the town barber.
You need a shave anyway,
Your Majesty.
Ain't he the beatenest?
"Runaway slave wanted for murder.
Reward $200."
A young'un by the name of Huckleberry Finn...
...was killed up Hannibal way, cut up and drowned in the river.
Next day, the slave run off.
Poor little chap.
Weren't no older than you are.
Yeah, poor little chap.
Mammy and Pappy must be sorrowing fit to bust.
Yeah, especially his pap.
Runaway slave answers to the name of Jim.
That's your name, ain't it?
Oh, but the slave they're looking for...
...well, he killed a young'un no older than me.
So it couldn't have been Jim...
...because I ain't dead.
Here. Touch me.
Go ahead, touch me.
Touch him. Touch him.
There he is now.
Whatever he tells you to do, you do.
I appreciate your help in this matter.
Allow me to introduce the leading tonsorial wizard of this fair metropolis.
My brother, the Reverend William Wilks...
...our nephew Percy, and that there is our loyal manservant.
You're the one that's afflicted, ain't you?
- Beg pardon?
- The one that's deaf and dumb.
- Deaf and dumb?
- Since birth.
Mr. Peter Wilks told us all about his poor brother William.
Deaf and dumb?
Deaf and dumb.
Now, if your worship will excuse me,
I'll go tell...
What does he...?
Have you heard? The Reverend Wilks and his brother just arrived from England.
From now on, Bilgewater, the hand is quicker than the eye.
Our nieces Mary Jane and Joanna will be expecting us.
Poor fatherless waifs.
The Reverend Wilks and his brother arrived from England.
Dear Peter Wilks give up the ghost at 10 p.m. Last night.
A God-fearing man, who prayed on going to bed...
...getting up at noon every day of his life.
Miss Watson will sure run into him in heaven, all right.
Our dear, sweet nieces got nobody to turn to except their loving uncles...
...and, of course, their cousin Percy.
Here they come now,
Miss Mary Jane.
Oh, Joanna, our prayers have been answered.
Our dear uncles are here.
They're here. They're here.
Them two don't look like any reverends I ever seen.
This is it.
- By Jove, you must be Mary Jane.
- Uncle Harvey!
Mary Jane!
You're a grown young lady.
The very image of my dear brother.
Oh, Mary Jane.
Mary Jane, your uncles are here.
Hello.
Oh, Joanna, isn't this glorious?
Look at Percy.
He ain't even wearing shoes.
River pirates. They picked us clean...
...and stole the ecclesiastical yawl...
...a one master lent us for the journey upriver by the bishop of New Orleans...
...a dandy chap.
He's gotta put shoes on before he can be any kinfolk of mine.
Oh, Uncle Harvey...
...if you only could have arrived yesterday...
...before Father...
Alas! Alas! After 28 years, to have missed him by a hair.
Your Uncle William got a fierce yen to see the dear departed.
Artheline. Artheline.
See that their manservant has food and a place to sleep.
This way.
Blessings on you, citizens.
Percy, this is your home.
Hold on there, my dear.
Your Uncle William and me was on our way from England...
...to the deepest jungles of Patagonia for the purpose of converting the heathen there.
We're loaded with legal tender collected from our congregation...
...and what's ours is yours.
No, I insist, my dear.
The heathens can wait.
As the bard said,
"Blood is thicker than holy water."
But, Uncle Harvey, Father left us rich.
We've this house and a prosperous tannery business and $3000 in gold.
Hallelujah.
And he left $3000 in gold to you and Uncle William.
That ain't important.
All that counts is that you two sweet things is provided for.
- Father's in there.
- Yes.
We must thank our dear brother personal.
Percy?
Yes, sir.
What's the matter, Percy?
You scared?
Nope, but...
I reckon it'd just be too sad a sight for a boy my age.
I'd best look after Jim.
Yes, do so instanter.
Too late.
Alas! Too late!
Percy?
You're in an awful fret about that manservant of yours, ain't you?
Afraid he'll run off?
Jim? Why, he's the loyalest slave a body ever had.
Come along with me, Percy.
Well, come on.
All right. All right.
See that? That's a history book.
I read it, and it says they don't have slaves in England no more.
Well, we didn't get him in England.
We picked him up off some desert island, coming across the ocean.
Desert island? In the Atlantic?
The Pacific.
We come across the Pacific.
This here's a geography book.
I read it too.
The Atlantic is the only ocean between here and England.
I say, Joanna, old girl, who you gonna believe?
Some old geography book or a chap that's from there, by Jove?
Come along with me, Percy.
Well, come on.
This here's a Bible.
I keep it handy for making folks swear on it when I think they're telling stretchers.
Now put your hand on it and swear you ain't.
And don't tell me they use a different kind of Bible in England.
Come on.
Father's last wish was to see you and Uncle William.
That he was denied...
...but his last request will be fulfilled.
Then I know he'll rest in peace.
Don't give them the gold, Mary Jane.
Please don't. That'd be wrong.
No, Joanna's right.
This ain't no time for filthy lucre.
The very sight of that $3000 would sicken your Uncle William and me...
...but we can't be selfish.
Our dear brother's last request comes first. Open the box.
Let me help you with that.
I'll take care of this, my dear.
May his soul rest in peace.
This will turn many a Patagonian heathen on to the glory road.
Uncle Harvey, I wish I had the goodness of character...
...to sell the house and the tannery and apply the money in your noble works.
No, my dear. No, I can't allow it.
You and Joanna got to be took care of.
Unless, of course, you'd see fit to accept the hospitality of loving kinfolk...
...and join your Uncle William and me in merry old.
- England?
- There's a spare room in the rectory.
Oh, Joanna, think of it. To go to England and live with our dear uncles.
- Well, I ain't going.
- Joanna!
I don't mean to get ate by sharks, crossing the Pacific Ocean.
- Who was it told you about sharks, Joanna?
- Percy did.
He says you crossed the Pacific Ocean from
England, and I know there's sharks there.
Percy was mistaken. One crosses the Atlantic from England.
I knew it!
I knew he was telling stretchers.
Boy, you ain't Percy.
You're a fraud and an impostor!
And if you're a fraud and impostor, so are they!
- Now, see here, Joanna...
- Joanna, they can't be impostors.
They're clergymen.
All right, don't believe me.
I'm just a girl, but I ain't a dumb bunny.
I'm gonna get that sheriff.
He'll know whether they're frauds or impostors or not.
And he ain't a girl, so maybe you'll take his word for it.
Hallelujah.
Joanna, he's praying for you.
I'm just doing what we do every day at home in England...
...praying at the stroke of noon, like Uncle Peter wrote us he done.
Hallelujah.
The boy's a genius.
Joanna, how could you mistrust such a pious, God-fearing boy?
- I don't believe it!
- Joanna!
- Oh, Uncle Harvey.
- Amen.
There, there, my dear.
Things will be much better back home at the rectory.
- Oh, how good you are.
- Yes.
We'll leave soon as you get rid of the tannery and sell the house.
Tomorrow. After the funeral.
As soon as possible.
Just leave all them little, picky details to me.
How lucky we are to have such wonderful uncles.
Yes, yes, yes, my dear.
Oh, and poor little Percy.
How unhappy you must be in those awful rags and barefooted.
Come, let me take care of you.
I'll fix you all up.
- I have some clothes upstairs that'll fit you.
- The dear departed.
Jim.
Jim!
- Huck, honey.
- Come on.
What in the world happened to you?
Uncle Peter's coat and these shoes.
I can't stand it, Jim.
We gotta get.
Now, you go to the raft and float her a half-mile downstream and wait for me.
Besides, it's beginning to smell like trouble.
That Joanna, she's got her heart set on sniffing out royalty.
If she brings that sheriff around, he'll think you're that slave they're looking for.
Well, I is, ain't I?
Of course. That's why we can't take no chances.
It's fine of you to help me keep from getting caught...
...even if folks would say you're a low-down abolitionist for doing it.
Now, lookie here, Jim.
If the royalty gets caught for stealing that gold from them poor girls...
...I want folks to know that you and me had nothing to do with it.
And the only way we can do that is to hide the gold so it won't get stole.
Now, you go down to the raft, do you hear?
And I'll hide the gold. Get.
Where's the loot?
A profitable day's work, Regulus, and there'll be more where that come from.
It's almost too easy.
When you got all the fools in town on your side, that's a big enough majority anywheres.
You know, there's another 200 just asking to be picked up.
That slave of the young'un's, answers to Jim...
...just like that runaway they're looking for?
No. No, the kid wouldn't take to that kindly.
It'd be cutting off our noses to turn him against us. Yeah.
The way he saved our lives with that praying stunt, he's got the soul of an artist.
A little experience, proper teaching...
...he could be the greatest grifter this old river's ever seen.
No, we ain't gonna cash in that $200 black chip...
...not till we have to.
Take your shoes off.
I fall asleep.
I heard somebody.
Percy!
I snaked it from the...
Your uncles, and...
- I was hiding it for you.
- In Father's coffin?
- How could you do such a terrible thing?
- I told you so!
I can't believe it.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
Miss Mary Jane.
I put it there when I heard you coming.
Why didn't you just give the gold to me?
Well, I hid it. Then I was gonna hide it...
I mean, not hide it where I hid it, but I mean...
It don't sound too good, does it?
On top of everything else, I find you stealing from my father's coffin.
- Why, Percy? Why?
- It's the brain fever.
Grave robbing is always the first sign.
I told you about him and his stretchers.
Generally, we have to put him in irons till after it passes over.
- Nobody believes me, because I'm a girl.
- Go to bed. It's late.
- But he's telling...
- Do as I say.
Oh, poor Percy.
My name ain't Percy.
What is it, then?
Abner.
Abner Williams.
My folks was all killed off by the...
The Paiute Indians.
Poor little Percy!
Miss Mary Jane, you've gotta believe me!
They ain't your uncles.
They ain't Harvey and William...
Your Uncle William's the only one who can handle him at these times.
- Let go!
- My leg...
Poor William, that the first sound out of him should be a cry of pain.
It is a miracle!
You've gotta believe me!
- Please, Uncle Harvey, let him speak.
- Very well.
All right, Percy.
If we ain't the reverends, then who are we?
He's the duke of Bilgewater, and you're the king of France.
- Oh, Uncle Harvey!
- Miss Mary Jane, you've gotta believe me.
I could hardly believe my eyes.
I thought I was seeing double.
Mary Jane, the emphis Steamer just docked.
Buttercup. Heaven Rose.
Who in tarnation's
Buttercup and Heaven Rose?
Those were the names Father called
Joanna and me when we were little.
They're our real uncles.
Uncle Harvey!
And, Percy, oh!
You did it, boy.
- You cheated us out of $3000.
- Don't. Please don't.
You know what's gonna happen to you now?
How could you do this to me?
I trusted you, and I never trusted nobody afore in my life.
I had plans for you.
We could have trimmed every mark from here to New Orleans...
...but you put a knife in my back.
- Let me kill him!
No, you don't!
You're in enough trouble as it is.
The people in this town know the truth.
This town's full of fools who'll stand for anything...
...excepting being shown up for the fools they are.
I'm gonna catch you.
Wherever you go, remember that. The world ain't big enough for you to hide from me.
There ain't a corner of this earth far enough away that I won't find you.
I'll pay you back for your treachery,
I swear it. I swear a oath, boy.
We'll meet again.
- Sheriff.
- All right...
Marshal, we's delighted to see you!
- Don't try nothing.
- No.
No, my friend.
Trust breeding, marshal.
Goodbye, all. Goodbye.
Au revoir, sweet ladies.
Percy, wait!
How can we ever thank you for telling the truth?
I apologize, Percy, for thinking you were as big a snake as the other two.
My name ain't Percy.
Whoever you are, you're fit to be kinfolk of mine.
And I'll fight anyone who says you ain't.
Come on in here.
Make yourself at home.
He'll stay with us.
He can have Papa's old room.
It's only right, if he's to be the man of the house.
- I'm only a boy.
- He can go to school right here in Pikesville.
When he grows up, he can take over the tannery.
I ain't worthy.
I can't wait to see him all dressed up in brand-new clothes...
...and fine, black leather shoes and sitting in the family pew in church.
You'll have to go to church, Abner.
Unless you want to burn forever in the eternal fires of hell.
Yes, Miss Watson.
Yes, Miss Joanna.
Black leather shoes and a job in the tannery.
Can you picture it, Jim?
It put me in a fair sweat,
I can tell you.
Coming right on top of His Majesty swearing to get me.
My, but he was a hard lot, near as mean as Pap.
We dang near got caught.
I reckon just ain't no accounting for the ways of royalty, Huck.
Maybe it'd be better to go back to Hannibal...
...and not take no chances on getting caught down here.
What you talking about?
Well, it'd be better for you to be a slave back where your family is...
...long as you gotta be a slave.
I ain't gotta be a slave, and I ain't gonna be a slave.
I'm gonna be free soon as we get to Cairo.
Know what I'm gonna do soon as we cross that border?
I'm gonna get me a job, a real job where I gets paid.
In a store, maybe.
Can't you see me, Huck?
"Yes, ma'am. These needles is the finest we got, ma'am.
They only 5 cents.
Well, thank you, ma'am."
Now, won't that be fine, Huck?
That store of yours don't sound no more fun than a pair of black leather shoes.
I'm gonna make a pile of money so I can buy my wife from that old farmer that owns her.
Then we's gonna work hard and save up and buy the two children.
Oh, Huck, honey, everything's gonna be all right.
It's all on account of you helping old Jim.
I ain't helping you because I wants to be no better than a low-down abolitionist.
It's because the only way
I can keep from going back to Pap...
...is to make sure you get free.
- I know that, Huck. I know that.
Consarn it.
One thing and another.
And I'll be lucky if I ever get to New Orleans.
Huck, it's getting too foggy to see where we's going.
Look, Jim!
A houseboat.
She done kill herself on the rocks.
She looks deserted.
Let's go aboard.
I don't want to go fooling around no wreck.
"Keokuk, lowa."
Keokuk, lowa.
They come from up north.
Who knows? Maybe rich folks owned her.
Who knows what they left behind?
- Treasure even, maybe.
- Maybe.
Come on! Let's go.
Pap!
Jim! Jim!
Jim! Look what I found.
I told you there'd be treasure.
- What's in there?
- Don't go in there!
- Why not?
- There's a dead man in there.
- For sure?
- Somebody shot him right between the eyes.
Jiminy!
- Let's get out of here.
- Are the eyes still open?
Staring right at you.
- Let me see him.
- Huck, please don't go in there.
- I ain't never seen a dead man before.
- You seen Peter Wilks in his coffin.
Yeah, but he weren't murdered.
Looking in the eyes of a dead man is the worst bad luck you can get.
Well, I don't believe in signs.
I'm gonna look.
You listen to me, Huck, you do what I said! You hear?
Don't you go in and look at that man.
Please, Jim, don't hurt me, please.
Oh, Huck. Oh, honey.
I'm sorry.
Old Jim wouldn't hurt you for nothing in the world.
Oh, my God. Forgive me for this.
Who's in there?
Come on out unless you want a load of buckshot in your forward cabin.
Why, ain't but a boy.
What could I do for you gentlemen?
We's slave catchers.
Looking for runaways.
Who you got aboard there?
Now, don't you try lying, boy.
We heard you talking.
- How many of them is in there?
- Just one other.
White or black?
White. I sure am glad you all come along.
You see, it's my cousin Jeb.
Him, he's sick.
I got that raft over there so I could bring him in to shore.
Maybe you gentlemen could help me get Jeb on the raft...
...so I could take him in to shore.
- We's in a hurry, boy.
- Now, Obie, we gotta help him.
Well, reckon we come aboard and have a look.
Come right in, gentlemen.
Come right in.
Straight ahead.
- Well, where's he at? In that room there?
- I guess so.
Cousin Jeb will be much obliged.
Everybody else we asked run off.
- That's infernal mean.
- Odd too.
Lookie here, boy.
What's the matter with your cousin Jeb?
Well, it's the...
- Nothing much.
- You're lying, boy!
- What you keeping such a secret in there?
- Let's have a look.
You won't have to touch Jeb, so there ain't much chance you'll catch it.
Don't you go in there!
That cousin of yours got the smallpox, and you know it.
Why didn't you just say so?
Well, when I told folks, they run off.
Let's get out of here.
Don't leave people to guess what's the matter.
Thank you. Thank you kindly.
Breaking up.
Let's get out of here.
Look! Get him!
I can't see him!
- There!
- Get the skiff!
- Well, we'll tend to him later.
- Lf he get away, we lose $500 bounty.
- Come on!
- The skiff's done floated off.
- Here, hold this.
- Get the hook.
Hurry it up.
Jim!
- Wait. Come on. Come on.
- Go! They's over that way.
They's over that way.
I heard them.
Engines full ahead.
From the sound of it, we just chewed up a raft, captain. No need to stop.
Reverse your engines. If that was a raft, there might have been men on it.
- Reverse engines!
- Yes, sir.
Mighty strange, a little boy alone on a raft with a negro. Eh, captain?
Jim here's my lawful manservant.
Williams is my name, captain.
Percy Williams.
And like I said,
Jim here's my lawful manservant.
My folks was all killed off by impostors posing as relatives.
We had to run off or get killed.
You see, don't you, captain?
You're giving me answers to questions I never asked.
I don't care where you've been.
All that concerns me is where this boat's going, and that's all the way to New Orleans.
You got passage money?
Passengers is the only ones that keep idle aboard my ship, so you've got to work.
There's a fireman needed in the hold, and my cabin boy's run away on another ship.
Me? A cabin boy?
You sent for me, sir?
Yeah, I got an errand for you.
Yes, sir?
You wanna take her, boy?
- Do I! Sir.
- Come along.
- Thank you, sir.
- Keep her firm but easy.
She's got a will of her own, but you let her know who's the boss.
Don't seem like there's nothing to it at all.
Who'd ever figure piloting the Mississippi was this easy?
Be careful, boy. It takes a long time to learn the river...
...and just when you do, she changes on you.
One thing about her never changes.
She can take you anywheres you wanna go in the whole world.
If you know and understand her, she'll do that, but there's another side to her.
She can kill you on a reef, or she can take you straight down to the bottom too.
- I don't see no sign of a reef.
- Of course you don't.
There's one out there on the portside.
That's a sandbar building up.
I've been expecting that from the kind of spring we had.
Moonlight's showing lines and circles in slack water.
That's a sign of troublesome places shoaling up.
Signs. That's the only help you get from the river.
Hot sun means there's going to be wind tomorrow.
A floating log means the river's rising.
A silver cloud across the moon shows there's a storm coming...
...and a storm can take you right up onto a snag.
Now, all them's signs, son...
...and you got to learn them if you're going to learn the river.
I always thought them...
Them signs was so...
- Beautiful?
- Yes, sir.
And now I find out they don't mean nothing but trouble.
But they're still beautiful, boy.
Don't you ever lose sight of that.
The beauty of the river is the first thing a man sees.
Then he learns the orneriness that lurks beneath.
And sometimes, that takes away the beauty, and that's a bad thing.
If it ever happens to you, boy, you get off the river.
Meantime, mind your chores. One of them is to look to the wants of the officers.
So you step down to the bar and fetch me a pint of spirits.
Yes, sir.
Now, then...
I'm breaking watch soon...
...and I'll want easing off after this night's work.
- Well, go ahead.
- Yes, sir.
Pint of spirits for the captain.
Bartender, how about a drink for my lady friend?
What seems to be the troub...?
Why, you little...
It's you!
I'm gonna kill you, boy.
You know how?
I'll throw you in that paddle wheel.
Even if they find the pieces the fish don't eat...
...they'll still think it's an accident!
- Now back to the paddle wheel!
- No, no, no, Bilgewater.
That ain't the Christian way.
I didn't mean Your Highnesses no harm.
We know that. I, by divine right, and Bilgewater here, by his infinite wisdom...
...that concern for them sweet Wilks gals was the only thing in your heart. We knew.
- We did?
- Why, of course.
So we'll just let the dead past bury the bygone.
- Will you shake on that, Percy?
- Abner.
Abner.
A $20 gold piece!
Nothing like coin of the realm to seal up the raveled sleeve of friendship.
Much obliged.
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
I gotta give the captain his pint.
Oh, Abner! Tell me...
...how is your African friend?
- Jim?
He drowned. Slipped off the raft in a deep sleep. Never knowed the difference.
I saw to it that he got proper funeral orgies.
That must have made you feel plenty sick.
Nope. He was talking in his sleep, saying how he was gonna run off to the free states.
No!
I was so mad. I was all ready to shove him off the raft.
I would've if he hadn't rolled over and just saved me the job.
Well, I guess it's just for the best somehow.
If he was aboard this steamer, he'd be in plenty hot water.
Tomorrow, we put in to the last town before Cairo.
There'll be slave catchers and law officers all over this old tub looking for runaways.
Well, good night, Abner.
Pleasant dreams.
Come, Bilgewater.
Leave it to me.
Slickers.
Gee, it sure fit me good, but Capt. Sellers...
...he'll need it for the next cabin boy.
Well, you stay here.
I'll go ashore by myself.
It ain't but a little ways to the free territory.
If you get caught, Jim,
I'll have to go back to Pap.
But this is your chance.
Capt. Sellers, he be going downriver to New Orleans.
- Don't you want me to go with you?
- Of course I do.
Well, then, come on!
- Be careful.
- All right. You too.
It's cold.
- You let them get away!
- Easy, easy, Bilgewater.
That $200 is as good as in our pockets right now.
You just leave everything to me.
Carmody's carnival!
See it now!
This is our last stop before heading north.
Ten cents! The tenth part of a dollar.
No expense has been spared...
...in making this the greatest show on the Mississippi.
See the lions perform!
Bearded lady!
Bareback riders!
You crossing over to Cairo, Illinois, mister?
Yep! Going north tonight.
Today's the last chance to see the show...
...that thrilled the crowned heads of Europe!
The greatest extravaganza ever seen in these parts.
Come on, Jim.
Boys, over this way.
All right, George, keep them moving.
Catched six of them trying to get across Goodman's Creek into free territory.
They'll be on their way south by the next boat.
You stay here, Jim.
We're gonna join the circus.
Be careful, now.
Oh, Orville, stand up.
You can't learn any new tricks laying down.
Orville!
Beg pardon, but where can I find
Mr. Carmody?
Here's his dinner.
- Orville don't like turnips.
- He'll eat the same as me.
But, Mr. Carmody, if he don't get red meat soon...
...l'll be afraid to go in the cage with him.
What happened to that zebra?
Well, he was pulling the lead wagon the night it rained.
And when we get to Chicago, we'll be living off the fat of the land.
Mr. Carmody.
Ten cents! The tenth part of a dollar.
We have spared no expense to give you the greatest show on the Mississippi.
- We got a snake handler.
- That's me.
A bareback rider that defies death by riding a dangerous African zebra.
And he can get ornery at times.
You don't have an emperor of Patagonia, I suppose?
Emperor of Patagonia?
No, we haven't got one of them...
...but we do have a juggler that's A-number-one...
...east or west of the Mississippi.
If I had some oranges,
I could show you.
And we've got an honest-to-goodness lion act.
Oh, well, being as how I'm the world's youngest lion tamer myself...
...that wouldn't interest me none.
You're the world's youngest lion tamer?
Well, that's how I was billed in my folks' circus.
When they had a circus, before they all died off of the smallpox.
The emperor of Patagonia and me, well, we had it before, so naturally we lived.
Well, I ain't never heard of Patagonia, let alone the emperor.
Well, that don't hardly seem possible.
Everybody out West had heard of him.
Folks would come from miles around just to see a genuine piece of royalty.
My folks snaked him out of Patagonia when they was there converting the heathen.
I thought you said they was circus folks.
Well...
They slid into that when they seen there was no money in heathens.
I see.
And they sure struck it rich with the emperor.
He was our biggest attraction.
I used to get a sore arm, toting them sacks of money to the strongbox.
You're the world's youngest lion tamer?
We already have a lion tamer.
Me.
I can't take another lion tamer's job.
Well, Orville might not be happy working with anybody but me.
And I might not be happy working with Orville.
He didn't mean that, Orville.
Lion taming's out, but as long as you ain't got another emperor of Patagonia...
Well, now, if we weren't leaving town tonight, I'd like to talk to him, but...
It wouldn't do you no good.
Unless you could talk Patagonian, like me.
Well, what if he was to say to you:
"Gorp gorp figgle-zoop plunk."
Well, you wouldn't have no notion what he was saying to you.
- What would he be asking for?
- For one of them turnips.
Well, you bring him around, and I'll talk to him.
But if I do put him on and he starts drawing crowds...
...he's gotta stay with us till we get to Chicago, and them's my terms.
Well, I'll do my best to convince him...
...but I ain't promising nothing.
He's got an uncommon level head for a Patagonian.
You didn't believe all that, did you, Mr. Carmody?
Not one single word of it.
But that young'un's got more circus blood in him than you and me put together.
Just hold still, and I'll make the prettiest old zebra out of you you ever did see.
There.
Keep going, Jim.
Just gurgle more.
Huck, honey, I'm grateful for you teaching me Patagonian and all that...
...but how come we just can't wait till it's dark and sneak across the border?
You'll get caught for sure, Jim.
This way, we get free board and lodging all the way to Chicago.
Them men had their tongues hanging out just to get us to go along with them.
Just think, Jim:
Carmody's International
Carnival and Circus.
Carmody and Finn's
International Carnival and Circus.
Finn and Carmody's
International Carnival and Circus.
Try it again, Jim.
Ladies and gentlemen, you have all seen the vicious bear...
...the screeching vultures, the African zebra...
...the roaring lion, bearded ladies, bareback riders...
...midgets, animal acts and the like.
And now...
...for the very first time in these parts...
...Carmody's International
Carnival and Circus presents...
...accompanied by his friend and interpreter...
...formerly the world's youngest lion tamer...
...His Highness, the emperor of all Patagonia!
The emperor greets you.
And now, if any of you good people have any questions...
...that you would like to ask the emperor about Patagonian politics...
...or international diplomacy...
...or harem life...
...just speak right up.
Now, are there any questions?
How much does an emperor get?
- A hundred dollars a month.
- A hundred dollars a month.
I'd have never believed it.
Now, are there any other questions?
Don't he know that keeping a harem is sinful?
The emperor says he didn't knowed it till he got to this country.
But when he gets his throne back, he's gonna kick out all the harem, excepting one.
Now, there's a fair deal and a big move to make.
- Now, are there any more questions?
- Yeah!
I got a question
I'd like to ask the emperor.
Send for the sheriff.
All right, speak right up.
Well, speak up, sir. Don't be afraid.
Ask the question.
I'd like to ask the emperor...
...what's the penalty in Patagonia for impersonating royalty?
What do we do?
Soon, cut out to the river real, real soon.
Man dangerous.
The emperor says that's a very interesting question...
...and he'd like an hour or two to think it over.
Now, if you good people will excuse him. Come on, Jim.
That ain't the right answer.
Although it's the one you might expect from an impostor.
Impostor? Now, just a minute...
I charge you with harboring a runaway slave!
A runaway slave?!
That couldn't be!
Why, the emperor here was brought to me...
...by one of the most respected circus folks in the country.
World's youngest lion tamer?
- That's right. You recognized him.
- No.
But I'd sure like to see him do his stuff.
Matter of fact,
I'd give $ 100 American currency...
...to see that young'un jump into the lion's cage.
A hundred dollars? Come on, son.
But, Mr. Carmody,
I'm only a boy.
That's those darn turnips.
They've made him mad.
Well?
Is he a lion tamer, or is he a fraud?
I got $ 100 that says he's a fraud.
I'll split it with you, 50-50.
Are they frauds or ain't they?
Let them prove it.
We're waiting.
Come on, put up or shut up.
Hold it straight and tight.
And don't be afraid.
Huck, honey, don't go in there.
- He's a slave, a runaway slave!
- Run, Jim, run!
- After him!
- That's him! That's the one!
That's him!
- There he is! There he is!
- Jim.
- Jim.
- Huck!
- Huck, honey.
- Jim.
You little...
You're smart, aren't you, boy?
Too bad you found out how smart you are. You overreached.
Well, I'm gonna learn you overreaching don't pay.
Help! Help!
Help!
Hey, Orville hasn't had red meat in weeks.
Get out of there!
Come on, get out.
Just relax, sweetheart.
Just calm down, baby.
Who's out there?
Blackie, Bullet, shut up.
You'll wake up the dead.
Jim.
Huck, honey.
- Jim.
- I'm sure glad to see you.
We gotta get.
I was so close to freedom, right across them trees.
Wasn't no more than a mile or two, and then there's Goodman's Creek.
Across that creek is the free territory.
Some slaves around here told me...
I mean, them other slaves.
You could squeeze through here, couldn't you, Jim?
It ain't no use, Huck.
I'm too big a sinner.
You're always chattering about sin.
You ain't never sinned.
Except for running away from the widow...
...and I ain't even sure that's a sin.
Well, I lied to the best friend I ever had and kept him feared, and that's a sin.
Your pap, Huck, he's dead.
You remember that houseboat and that dead man was on it?
Well, that was your pap.
Poor Pap.
He never once in his life had any good luck.
And all this time,
I been afearing Pap...
...and there weren't no reason to be afeard.
I can't blame the Lord for not helping me, the way I treated you, Huck.
You know who the Lord helps, Jim?
Them that helps theirself.
Yes?
I'm Miss Douglas.
You got my runaway slave, name of Jim.
Well, yes, ma'am. Come in.
Come in.
You're no more than a girl,
Miss Douglas.
A mighty pretty one,
I might add.
But still no more than a girl.
Jim belongs to my ma.
We were staying at the hotel in town, just visiting here.
You can imagine the fit it put us in when we seen you dragging our slave up the street.
My ma, she took to her bed straight off.
That poor woman. Sit down.
Thank you. Thank you kindly.
The quicker she gets that naughty Jim back to Hannibal, the better off she'll be.
Of course. I'll fetch him.
I almost forgot.
The reward.
The reward?
Well, $200 your ma offered for the capture of the slave.
I'll have to get the two gentlemen that brought him in afore I turn him over to you.
Ma's in... Ma's in an awful sweat to get him home...
...so she can scold him proper for running off.
It won't take but a bit to get the two of them.
If you mind waiting, you can come along.
I'll wait, thank you.
How do you do?
I thought I heard voices.
The sheriff went to fetch the gentlemen that catched our Jim.
What a pretty dress.
This old thing?
My niece Betsy's got one an awful lot like it.
- She's just about your size too.
- Imagine that.
Betsy's staying with us for a few days.
Here?
Got a new baby over at her house, and her ma's got her hands full.
Ain't no need to whisper. Betsy could sleep through an earthquake.
Have a chair.
Thank you kindly.
Well, now, what might your name be?
- Sarah.
- Pretty name.
My mother's name was Sarah.
I always thought if me and Harlan had us a girl, I'd name her that in memory.
A girl child must be nice to do for...
...to make frilly dresses for her and the like...
...to teach to cook and to sew.
My ma learned me all them things.
Lucky woman, your ma.
We wasn't blessed but the one time.
Harlan. Named for his pa, of course.
Oh, fiddly-daddle!
I dropped a stitch.
I don't see it nowhere.
It's all right.
I found it.
- What'd you say your name was?
- Mary.
I thought you said it was Sarah before?
Yes'm, I did. Sarah Mary.
Some calls me Sarah, and some calls me Mary.
- That's the way of it, is it?
- Yes'm.
- Do me a favor, would you?
- Yes'm.
Thread a needle for me.
It's in there. Just...
That's it. Open it up.
I could do it if I was alone, but Ma always told me...
...spitting in public weren't proper.
All right, boy, what's your real name?
Bill or Bob or Tom, or what is it?
Please don't poke fun at a poor girl like me, ma'am.
Why, you ain't no girl.
You don't catch like a girl.
You don't know nothing about threading a needle.
Imagine holding a thread still and bringing the needle up to it.
You don't wear shoes like a girl.
Fact is, you don't wear no shoes at all.
Trying to hornswoggle me!
What are you, a runaway apprentice?
They treated you bad, and you made up your mind to cut. Is that right?
- Well, what you doing here?
- They...
They said they'd pay me if I helped slaves get free.
Abolitionists!
Well, you're honest.
I'll say that.
You just tell the sheriff the truth like you told me, and it won't go hard with you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Could I please have a drink of water?
I'll get you some lemonade.
Thank you kindly.
I always kept a pitcher of lemonade for Harlan.
I've got the keys, Jim.
You'd do this for me, Huck, after I lied to you about your pap?
Well, I don't think it was right, Jim...
...but I never known nobody who didn't lie one time or another.
Besides, I'm beholden to you for saving my life.
Let's go.
I can't go, Huck. It's my leg.
These things hurt.
My leg's too big.
Jim.
Come on, let's go.
Help me.
Come on, let's go.
- It weren't a girl. It was a young boy.
- It's him.
Poor thing. He must have been scared and scooted out.
- Well, quick, afore he gets the slave.
- Where's he at?
- He's over in the shack.
- Listen here, Harlan.
Take it easy with that poor child.
Yes, love, I will.
- They're gone. Get the dogs.
- Gone?
- Probably headed to Goodman's Creek.
Come on, hurry them up.
Blackie, Bullet, come on.
You two just stay out of the way.
- Here, let me help you. Come on.
- How much further?
You have to try, Jim.
You have to try.
They got the scent, all right.
Those slaves lied, Huck.
Maybe we took the wrong way.
Come on, we're close.
I know it.
Look, Jim. Goodman's Creek.
I can't make it, Huck.
It's my leg.
You gotta get across.
Go on, Jim. Go on.
The vest. Give me the vest.
Thattaboy. Now get!
Get, straight thataway. Good luck, Jim.
Straight thataway, go on.
Over this way!
We got him! We got him, sheriff!
Sheriff, he done it. He done it.
He let that slave go free.
All right, boy, where is he?
- He drowned trying to cross the creek.
- He's lying!
I ain't blaming you for getting mad, mister.
The job you gave me was to get him free, and not to get him drowned.
- What?!
- So it wouldn't be right, keeping this.
- Twenty-dollar gold piece? Abolitionist!
- Why, you little...
No, you don't!
- I'll keep this for evidence.
- We ain't aboli...
You shut up.
I reckon I'm as bad as they are, sheriff...
...but what chance has a poor little boy like me got with grown-up slickers?
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Here.
The judge ain't gonna like the sound of that kind of talk.
I know this wasn't none of your doing, boy, but you best come along.
Bet you're as hungry as a bear.
I'd like to, sheriff, but I'm worried about my raft.
I left her up on the creek...
...and I'm all in a sweat somebody might have took her.
Nothing's safe with abolitionists around.
Sheriff, don't lis...
No more of that if you want this buckshot to stay in the barrel.
Soon as you find your raft, you hide her good.
Then come back to the farm.
The missis made huckleberry pie today.
It's my favorite.
Now get moving...
...both of you.
Now you hustle along, boy, or my missis will send me back for you.
Jim! Jim!
Jim!
Jim, where are you?
Here I am, Huck! Here!
Look what I found!
A new raft.
- Ain't she a pretty one?
- Sure is pretty, Huck.
Found a good one, didn't I?
- Where'd you ever find it?
- She sure is a nice one.
Bless your little heart.
- Am I glad to see you.
- Me too.
She ain't as good as ours by a thousand miles.
She needs a wigwam for keeping out the rain.
And a nice dirt floor so she'd be high and dry.
Turns out I wasn't lying to that sheriff.
You better keep out of sight.
- They'll be coming back to fetch me.
- It don't matter now, Huck. I'm free.
Me too, and I aim to stay that way.
That nice woman of his probably got her heart set on teaching me...
...how to thread a needle proper.
What you gonna do, Huck?
I reckon I should go back and show the widow and Miss Watson I'm alive.
That's good. You do that.
That's what I should do, but I can't float upstream to Hannibal...
...so I'll just have to keep going south for a while.
Might even go as far as New Orleans.
- Maybe I better go with you.
- Well, I'll be hornswoggled.
After all the pains I've been to.
Then why don't you come with me, Huck?
We'd get a fine job up north.
Maybe the same store.
We could work hard and save up.
Before you know it, we'd open up our own store. Oh, lordy, Huck...
...before you know it, we'd be rich, you and me both.
Now, wouldn't that be fine?
I wouldn't be no good in that store, Jim...
...unless I got all civilized...
...and I been there before.
A steamboat!
I'm going south, Jim.
Give me a push off.
If I get in the main stream,
I can catch her.
Boy, ain't she a beaut, Jim?
You take care, now, Huck.
Ain't no telling how much mischief you can get into between here and New Orleans.
That's for sure.
I hope you get rich, Jim.
Richer than Croesus himself.
You'll write to me, Huck?
I can't write too good, Jim.
It don't matter.
I can't read at all.
Bye, Jim.
Bye, Huck, honey.
God bless you.
[ENGLISH]
Gentlemen...
We are gathered here today as representatives... of some of the greatest design teams in the world.
We are here to listen to a proposal... from a Mr. X... a man who is 50 years ahead of his time...
A man who is undoubtedly... the world's greatest aircraft designer.
The daddy of them all.
Mr. X?
Are you with us?
Yes... l am with you,
Mr. President.
Gentlemen, you must forgive the extraordinary... security precautions taken today.
But when l tell you that Mr. X... is none other than the man who designed... the International
Rescue aircraft... you will understand the importance of security.
Mr. X has a proposition to put to us... for a revolutionary new type of aircraft. lt is, perhaps...
The most exciting moment in the history of our company.
And now, gentlemen, the moment has come.
What is it to be?
An aircraft that flies 10 times the speed of sound...
A space vehicle that travels the speed of light? lf l were able to guess...
Mr. X would not be here today.
And now, Mr. X, it is with great excitement... that we await breathlessly... the details of your new design.
Well, gentlemen... l thought it would be a good idea... in this day and age of, uh, speed...
And, uh, things like that... to build an...airship.
An airship?
An airship?
A beautiful island in the pacific... secret base of
International Rescue...
So far undetected.
Outwardly, the luxury home of millionaire ex-astronaut...
Jeff Tracy.
Now, let's have a rundown... on the International
Rescue craft.
At the moment, there are 5.
Thunderbird 1... sleek, first, and fast.
Thunderbird 2... giant transporter.
Carries all the rescue gear to the danger zone.
Thunderbird 3... designed for space rescue.
Thunderbird 4... capable of withstanding the pressure of the depths.
Thunderbird 5... space monitor.
Capable of receiving or intercepting... distress calls from any part of the world.
And l'm telling you, Brains, in no uncertain terms...
That we now need a Thunderbird 6.
Sure, Mr. Tracy.
But can you give me some sort of a steer? l like to work to a specification.
Specification?
You didn't need to work to a specification... when you designed that airship... for the New World
Aircraft Corporation.
That's right. l didn't.
And what happened?
They laughed.
Yeah, that's right.
They laughed.
And then they built it.
There you are, Brains.
Your specially commissioned painting of Skyship 1.
Thanks, Virgil. lt's really great.
But l guess that's about the nearest... l'm gonna get to it for some time. l'm sorry about this,
Brains.
But l've got this feeling, and l know l'm not wrong.
We desperately need a Thunderbird 6.
That's OH, Mr. Tracy.
Of course, l would have liked... to have been on the maiden voyage.
Sure.
But at least
International Rescue... will be represented by
Alan, Tin Tin, and Penelope.
They'll give you a full report.
So, you like the painting, eh?
Say, talking of painting...
Alan?
Yes, Dad?
You better get cleaned up.
Don't forget, it's your farewell dinner tonight.
Just 10 more minutes, Dad, and l'll be through.
How's she looking?
Great. Just great. l finished our packing, Mr. Tracy.
Our packing?
Tin Tin, come here a minute.
Certainly, Mr. Tracy. ls there anything wrong?
Tin Tin, Alan wanted to travel to England... in an unconventional way.
Well, l've organized that.
But it's gonna be a long journey... and not exactly the way for a young lady to travel... in this day and age.
You are traveling by scheduled airline.
But Mr. Tracy... l want to travel with Alan.
Now, Alan leaves tomorrow... and you leave in 2 weeks' time.
Understand?
Come on, Mother, over here.
You'll get a good view.
Well, l guess we've seen a lot of launchings... but this will beat all.
Say, where's Tin Tin? l don't know, Dad.
Strange.
Unusual for her not to see Alan off.
Here she comes.
So long, folks.
Dearest Brains... l know how much this project means to you... and l feel that you, not l, should be making this trip.
But, of course, you are the one person who cannot be spared. l shall be thinking of you.
Love, Tin Tin.
P.S... l stowed aboard the Tiger with Alan.
She's what?
That's right, Mr. Tracy.
She's aboard the Tiger with Alan.
He flies through the air
With the greatest of ease
The daring young man in his flying machine
His movements are graceful
All girls he can please
And my heart is stolen away lsn't it a lovely ou_it? lt belonged to my ancestor, the Duchess of Crighton Ward.
Well? What do you think,
Parker? l think it's very elegant, milady.
Mind you, l prefer mini-skirts m'self... but l suppose it's appropriate... that you should be dressed like that...
For the revival of the airship, so to speak.
Thank you, Parker.
And that ou_it suits you beautifully.
Well, if Alan's on schedule... he should be arriving at any moment.
Yes, milady. l understand that he's been on his way now for 2 weeks.
That's him, Parker.
We must go onto the roof and see him land.
Come on.
There it is, Tin Tin.
Yes, Alan!
It looks lovely!
OH. You know what to do. l expect he's coming in to land.
Milady, he's coming straight for us! l don't believe it.
Hi, Penny. Hi, Parker.
Alan, l'm so glad you're safe.
You gave us quite a scare.
Gee, l like your ou_it, Penelope.
Yes, l was rather pleased with it myself.
Uh, uh, excuse me.
All the family send their love to you.
Uh, excuse me,
Mr. Alan. Excuse me.
What is it, Parker?
Uh, your aircraft, sir.
It's got no pilot. l--l just thought l'd point it out to you, sir.
Oh, forget about it,
Parker. l'm finished with it now.
Now, you were saying,
Penelope...
Mr. Alan, please!
Don't you understand? lt's gonna crash into the house!
Parker! What has got into you?
Sorry about that, Alan.
Stone the crows... lt's going to land on its own.
Parker? Milady?
Tin Tin's an excellent pilot.
Don't you think, Parker?
You should have seen
Parker's face, Tin Tin. lt was the funniest thing l've ever seen in my life. l can just imagine it.
Of course, l saw immediately what Alan was up to because l knew you were on board.
Jeff called me yesterday. l could hardly keep a straight face.
Come in.
All the baggage is aboard, milady.
Thank you, Parker.
Now, there's only one thing
Ieft to do before we leave.
Bon voyage.
Bon voyage.
Bon voyage, milady.
As president of the New
World Aircraft Corporation... this flight is of paramount importance to me.
The fact that members of International Rescue... will be on the maiden flight... enables us to achieve worldwide publicity. ln order to make this possible in the first place... we have given assurances to them... that the strictest security arrangements... will be enforced.
That is why the airfield is cleared of all personnel.
The passengers are due to arrive in, um...
30 minutes.
Contact.
Virg, l can see them at 2 o'clock!
OH. l've got them, Scott.
Right.
Operation escort, go!
This is what l call driving in style, milady. lt isn't every Rolls-Royce that has an aircraft escort.
OH, all checks complete.
-Martin?
-Yes, sir.
-Lane?
-Yes, sir.
-Carter?
-Yes, sir.
-Hogarth?
-Yes, sir.
OH. Return to your posts... and await the arrival of the passengers.
Hold it right there.
Quickly, we haven't much time.
Scott from Penelope.
Come aboard with the others and have a farewell drink.
We'll meet you in the ballroom.
The ballroom!
May l book the first dance?
No, Scott.
It isn't what it seems.
You'll see.
And now, by the courtesy... of the New World
Aircraft Corporation... we bring you the
Drinking Half Hour!
Now, milady, what will it be? l think this occasion calls for champagne... all around, Parker.
All around, milady?
All around, Parker.
And now,
Iadies and gentlemen... on behalf of the New World
Aircraft Corporation... l welcome you aboard
Skyship 1.
As you know, this is the maiden flight. lt is, of course, a great honor... for us to have such distinguished guests.
You can be assured that the crew and myself... will do everything in our power... to make this a trip to remember.
Well, bon voyage.
Bon voyage!
Godspeed, milady.
OH, one minute to takeoff.
Now, we know the ship is fully automated.
Everything is preprogrammed-- height, speed, course.
We're all supposed to be trained men.
The only way that our cover will be broken... will be if anything goes wrong with the ship.
Takeoff now, 30 seconds.
Well, we're off.
Come in.
Dinner is served in the bottle room, milady.
Well, they've gone.
May we have the blinds drawn, Captain?
The entire operation of this Skyship...
Lady Penelope, is totally automatic.
As the light falls, the curtains will draw automatically.
Of course.
That's just the sort of thing...
Brains would have thought of.
Well, it looks as if we're all set for a lovely, peaceful holiday.
Calling Black Phantom.
This is White Ghost.
Calling Black Phantom, this is White Ghost.
Come in, Black Phantom.
Come in, Black Phantom.
Have disposed of cargo.
Operation Ambush underway.
Calling
International Rescue.
This is Lady Penelope.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbird 1 and 2... to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details. lt's going to be difficult.
That's what we're paid for.
Now, l've had this whole place bugged. l want every word she speaks on this trip... to be recorded.
Whenever possible, l'll talk to her myself... and maneuver the conversation... in the right direction.
Right. Get to work.
OH, Carter, breakfast is served.
Start recording.
Morning, Alan.
Morning, Penny.
Morning, Alan.
Breakfast over New York.
What an experience.
This is really the way to travel.
Yeah, it's great.
Only thing is, as the ship's fully automated... if anything should go wrong with the computer... we could hit one of these skyscrapers... and then we'd really be in trouble.
Then, Alan... it would just be a simple case of... calling
International Rescue.
OH.
Calling International Rescue.
And now, gentlemen... it is with pride that l present to you Thunderbird 6.
Now, so that l'm able to demonstrate... this new machine properly... l have built this radio-controlled model.
The situation?
Man trapped in top floor of burning skyscraper.
Thunderbird 6 drives up to the building.
The helium balloon now rises... lifting a plastic hose into the air.
When the balloon reaches the correct height... the reel is locked off. l don't get it, Brains.
What's the point?
This is the point.
And so you see, gentlemen... another international rescue is made possible.
Well, Mr. Tracy, what do you think?
Well, it's, uh, certainly ingenious, Brains.
But it means building a vehicle... that gives us only one means of rescue.
The end product just doesn't justi_ the cost. l--l'm sorry. l'm afraid you'll have to scrap it... and start again.
Too bad about the wasted effort.
Wasted effort, Mr. Tracy?
Heh heh.
What's a mere 28 days...
Working day and night...
Think nothing of it.
We must be descending. l'm getting butterflies. l always do when we lose height.
You're absolutely right,
Lady Penelope.
We'll soon be flying over the Grand Canyon... at zero feet.
An automated announcement... will tell us when it's the right time.
Don't worry, you won't miss a thing.
There. You can see our exact position.
The Grand Canyon.
You know, l was once hopelessly lost... in a jet plane, and then, at last... l made contact with the Grand.
Was l glad to hear that voice!
You are directly over the Grand Canyon.
Your position

Correction, Captain Foster. lnternational fix system
24-04. Reference E.
Of course. 24-04.
Heh. l didn't think l'd ever forget that.
Ladies and gentlemen... we are now approaching the Grand Canyon. lf you care to take up your positions on the balcony... you will be in good time... to get the most advantageous view point. l think it's the most beautiful sight l've ever seen.
Come across to the other side of the ship.
There's an even better view over there.
Yes, let's do that. l really don't think l like Captain Foster.
Ah, he's just an old man.
Thunderbirds 1 and 2... l trust the beaujolais was to your liking, Parker?
And now, how about a cigar?
As you know, milady... l've been spending quite a lot of time... with the stewards... drinking and all that sort of thing.
Well, what worries me-- they--they don't seem to know as much... about the ship as they ought to.
Thank you, Parker. l've had my own thoughts on the matter. l'm glad you told me.
Yes. Well, uh-- sorry if l disturbed you, milady.
You were quite right,
Parker.
Good night.
Good night, milady.
Yes, Penelope? l've just had some information from Parker. l'm a little uneasy.
Tell me, what do you think of Captain Foster? l don't go for him,
Penelope.
He's a little too smooth for my liking.
Tell me, Alan, has he been questioning you... about International Rescue?
As a matter of fact, he has.
Well, not directly, mind you... but the conversation always seems to lead that way. l think we'll have to go into the situation... a little more closely. l don't like the sound of it.
The storm seems to be getting worse. l think you'd better come in here.
We need to discuss this right away.
Oh, well, um...
Perhaps we are allowing our imaginations... to run away with us.
After all... everyone's interested in International Rescue. lt's only natural he should ask questions.
Oh. So you don't think there's anything... to worry about, Penelope?
No. After all, they have all been screened.
They're carefully selected men.
That was a close one.
Put on the edited tape.
Right.
One thing's for sure.
We gotta play this really cool from now on.
Lady Penelope, l underestimated you.
Calling International Rescue.
Jeff, l want you to send
Thunderbirds 1 and 2. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
OH. Continue recording.
Doesn't sound as if we'll get much more tonight.
When l was talking to you just now, Alan... l discovered a bugging device in a lamp by my bed. l wondered why you'd changed your attitude... so abruptly.
What's our next move?
For the moment, nothing.
We know we're being bugged, but we don't know why.
We must just be on the alert.
OH. l'll mosey around... and see what l can find out.
Of course l understand,
Mr. Tracy. lt isn't quite the thing you had in mind.
Of course l don't mind designing yet another one.
You know, Scott, one of the remarkable things... about Brains is that he never loses his temper.
Well, if he did, l wouldn't blame him... after all the work he's done.
Upset? Me upset?
Of course l'm not upset!
Go ahead, John.
Father, l've just received a message... from Lady Penelope. lt was sent in scrambled electronic code.
Right, John. Let's have it. lt's just coming out of the descrambler now. lt reads, ''Ship bugged.
Reason unknown.
''Am investigating.
''lmperative, no communication from you.
''Will contact you when we have a lead.
''Signed, Penelope.''
F.A.B., John. Heep in touch. l don't like the sound of it, Dad.
We've gotta do something about this.
Yeah. But what?
Well, why not radio the police... at their next port of call?
Have the crew interrogated.
No. Whoever it is on that ship... that is looking for information... is probably an agent for a larger organization. lf we're to protect ourselves, we've gotta... wait for them to show their hand.
You lead an interesting but secretive life.
Your lifeline shows that you will meet many dangers.
You will become involved with a handsome stranger.
You would be well to let your heart guide you.
Well...stone the crows.
Beautiful, Alan.
But it's far too expensive.
Right. We'll take it.
You won't regret it, sir. lt will bring you much happiness.
Oh, Alan, it's been such a lovely day. l just wish it could never end.
The sari suits you very well, Penelope. lt was a very kind thought,
Captain. Thank you.
Did you get anything interesting today, Tin Tin?
Yes. Alan bought me this beautiful ring.
He paid far too much money for it... but l'm very thrilled with it.
Buying a ring for a young
Iady is prem significant... to me, Alan. Don't tell me you're going to desert... the league of bachelors. l'm afraid not,
Captain Foster.
The life l lead in
International Rescue... is far too dangerous to ask anyone... to share it with me.
For me, at the moment, marriage is out of the question.
That's right,
Captain Foster.
We all of us lead dedicated lives... in International Rescue.
And now, if you'll excuse me, l think l'll retire.
But wouldn't you like another drink?
Thank you, Captain, but no. lt's been a lovely, but very tiring day. l'm going to bed.
Oh, so soon? l'm afraid so.
Good night, everyone.
So, your rooms aren't bugged... but the lounge, bar, and dining room are.
All places where l go.
It would seem it's me... they want the information from.
But what? lf we knew that, we'd know the answer to everything.
Have you found any trace of the receiver?
Parker's had no luck.
None. The only place l haven't searched... is the gravity compensation room.
Well, the trip comes to an end in 14 days' time.
Whatever move they're going to make... must be made before we get back to England.
So we'll soon know. l think l can claim to have been to most places... in the world, but, oddly enough... l've never seen the pyramids. l've never seen them, either.
Well, we won't have long to wait.
We land in 15 minutes.
Oh, how dreadful.
What is it, Penelope?
There's been a terrible air crash.
A DX 102 airliner... tried to make a forced
Ianding on a disused... airfield 10 miles south of Casablanca. lts nose wheel collapsed... and the aircraft blew up, killing all aboard.
At last, we've got it. l've got to hand it to you, Carter... that newspaper idea of yours was just great.
Now, complete the editing. l want to hear that final message as soon as possible.
OH, girls, let's go.
Don't forget your camera, Penelope.
Don't worry. l've got it right here.
So, you see, Jeff, we nearly lost Parker.
Ah, now here's the coded bit.
We are enjoying our trip and looking forward... to our last port of call,
Switzerland.
Scott, take this along to Brain's lab... and get it decoded.
Yes, sir.
Oh, that's all right,
Mr. Tracy. l just love having my designs turned down.
Gee, Brains, your beautiful model.
Oh, h-hi, Scott.
Yeah. It just slipped out of my hand.
Dad wants you to decode this right away.
Gee, l wish there was something we could do to help them.
Don't worry. l've got a feeling... it won't be long now.
Mr. Tracy?
Yes, Brains?
Decoding of Penelope's
Ietter is as follows...
''lnterest is in me.
Reason unknown.
''Continue to stand by.''
Thanks, Brains.
Well, we now know that they're bugging only Penelope.
They're interested in what she says.
Now, what could
Penelope say... that would mean so much to someone with designs... on International Rescue?
Jeff, l want you to send...
Thunderbirds 1 and 2 to a disused airfield...
10 miles south of Casablanca. lnternational fix system.
24-04. Reference E.
Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details.
Perfect. Just perfect.
OH. Now, what next?
Now, watch carefully.
Tomorrow, we make our
Iast stop--Switzerland. lt certainly is a fantastic car you have, Penelope.
The only one of its kind in the world, Captain Foster.
When those skis appeared out of the bottom... l just couldn't believe my eyes.
Oh, it has many other devices, Captain.
Many of them still top secret.
Switching to full boost, milady.
How are you doing, Tin Tin?
Fine. Just fine.
Switch in thrusters.
OH.
Right, have you decided what you're going to eat?
Mmm. l think l'll start with avocado.
Tin Tin?
Artichoke, please.
Likewise.
Ah. And for me the speciality of the house.
This is a cute place. lt's certainly imaginative.
Let's hope the service is as good.
Well, l guess this is for us.
Gee, what a novel idea. lt must have been fun traveling in trains... like this years ago.
Well, let's unload the cargo.
As Parker would say,
''lt looks a real good nosh.''
Talking of Parker... what's happened to him?
Surely he's not still outside?
But, of course.
The car is heated, you know.
11 :OO. We must go.
The skyship is programmed to take off at midnight.
As a matter of interest,
Captain... what would happen if you didn't get back on time?
Your dream holiday would just come to an end.
And now, Cinderella, we must go.
Are we clear, Parker?
Quite clear, milady.
You debugged the whole place, Parker?
No need, milady. It was already done for me.
There's not a hidden microphone anywhere, milady.
They've all been removed.
That can only mean one thing.
They've got the information they wanted. What now?
Parker, what have you to report?
Well, milady, they've been recording you on a tape machine... in the gravity compensation room. l managed to get a look in there.
They've been editing the tape--that was obvious.
And now they've got the tape machine... linked to a radio transmitter.
The jigsaw's nearly completed but not quite.
Parker, issue the guns.
They're in the false compartment... at the bottom of my blue suitcase.
From now on, it's emergency standby.
Black Phantom from White Ghost.
Message will be transmitted
1000 hours tomorrow morning.
Gentlemen, the Thunderbird machines... will be arriving here at approximately...
1100 hours tomorrow morning.
The final phase of Operation
Ambush has commenced.
OH. Rewind and stand by.
OH. Ready.

Ensure that Brains is aboard.
This is imperative.
Do not acknowledge this transmission.
Will call later with further details.
The Thunderbird machines should be arriving... in approximately
10 minutes.
Stand by. lf pilots offer any resistance as they leave their machines... shoot them down. l've got it.
Penelope, l've got! lt's the only possible answer.
They've been recording your voice, right?
Right.
They've been editing the tape, right?
Right.
Editing is a form of rearranging.
They've been rearranging your words... to make you say something that they wanted you to say... and then they've transmitted it.
Now, who's the one person... who would act on your instructions?
Why, Jeff Tracy.
Roger, Scott.
Understand that you are at disused airfield.
Call me as soon as you've landed.
F.A.B.
Go ahead, Penny.
Jeff, this is an emergency.
Have you received a message from me?
Yes, Penelope. The boys are just about to land... at the rendezvous you requested.
Jeff, l haven't sent a message.
This is a trap.
Now, remember... just one sign of resistance from those pilots... and let them have it.
Thunderbird to base.
Thanks, Dad.
You gave us the warning just in time.
Setting course now to rendezvous with Skyship 1.
That's right, Scott.
The message was a recording of my voice.
Now, the quicker you arrive, the better for us.
You've got a fix on our position.
F.A.B.
OH, l've received a message from Black Phantom... to say the Thunderbird machines were landing.
By now, they must've taken over the ships... and shortly, they'll be on their way... to rendezvous with us.
Right, the playacting's over.
Round up our International
Rescue guests.
They're unsuspecting, so they won't be armed.
Not so unsuspecting,
Captain Foster.
Raise your hands, all of you. lt sounds as if Alan needs some help.
Tin Tin, l'll leave you my compact.
You can keep in touch with the boys.
F.A.B., Penny.
Come on, Parker.
Quickly, Parker.
Lane, get the other one as hostage. Quick.
OH, Foster, the numbers are eVen nOW... and we can outshoot you, you know that.
Throw your guns down and give yourselves up. l suggest you throw your guns down. lf you don't, you can say good-bye to Tin Tin.
Father, l've lost contact with Skyship 1.
Right, Scott.
At what position... do you expect to rendezvous with it?
According to my calculations, at approximately 10,OOO feet.
About 5 miles east of Dover.
Well, all you can do, Scott... is beat the hell out of those machines... and get there as soon as you can.
F.A.B.
Very smart, Penelope.
So you radioed your base?
That's right, Mr. Foster.
You should know that you can't outwit International Rescue. l'm not so sure.
The game isn't over yet.
We have you all as our hostages.
When the Thunderbird machines arrive... l've got an idea they're going to do... just what we tell them to.
Meanwhile, the gravity compensating machine... has come to a standstill.
The jet engines on this bus... are to give it forward movement only.
The ship can't maintain height... unless the gravity compensators are working. l'm well aware of the situation.
We're losing height quite slowly. lt'll be half an hour yet before there's any real danger. lt'll be half an hour yet before there's any real danger.
Martin, go up on the top deck... and radio down as soon as those
Thunderbirds arrive. Right.
Father, l'm at rendezvous point.
No sign of Skyship 1. l don't understand it, Scott. lt's a big ship.
It'd be hard to miss.
Oh, wait. l can see it. lt's about 8,OOO feet below me. l don't get it.
According to the New World pre-programmed schedule... it should be at 10,OOO feet at this point. l'm going down to take a look.
F.A.B.
Foster, Thunderbird 1 directly above us.
OH, Martin.
Right. Untie them. l want you all up on the top deck... and no false moves.
OH, father, l'm alongside. l can see one of the stewards standing... on the top deck.
Otherwise, no sign of life.
When Thunderbird 2 arrives, we'll attempt to board her.
Be with you in about
5 minutes, Scott.
OH, Virgil.
Dad, there's trouble ahead.
Dad, Skyship 1 is losing height.
Why? l don't know.
About one mile ahead is an early warning system... with interceptor towers.
The estimated height:
1,200 feet.
Below it is a missile site.
The way it looks from here...
Skyship 1 is on a collision course.
The only thing that can save it is its height.
But l've got my doubts. lt's a tower head.
We're going to hit it!
How far away is it? l don't know.
About a quarter of a mile. l'm coming up.
Dad, there's going to be a collision.
You'd better alert... all emergency services down on the ground. lt's a missile base about 5 miles east of Dover.
F.A.B.
What's the situation, Scott?
Well, the ship's swaying on top of one of the towers. lf that tower gives way... or the ship loses its balance... it's going to drop like a stone... it's going to drop like a stone... right onto that missile site below.
Come on, quickly.
Up on the top deck and move!
We've crashed, Foster.
Don't you understand?
Throw your gun away.
We're all in this together now. l said move!
Scott, l've been listening to your transmission. l've sighted Skyship. l'm coming in straight over the top.
Will lower escape unit.
Brains is already in there.
F.A.B. ls Brains armed?
He ought to be.
We've no idea what's going on. lt's OH, Dad. l've taken care of that.
Good boy.
Attention! Attention!
All personnel in section ''D''... to vacate site immediately.
Proceed with all movable equipment... to rendezvous ''G.''
This is an emergency.
Repeat: This is an emergency.
Virgil, pull off!
Pull off!
Your thrusters are throwing it off balance.
F.A.B.
Base and Thunderbird 2... we need to decide a course of action but fast.
As far as l can see... any attempt to get near that ship... is going to bring a disaster.
The turbulence from our motors alone... will be enough to tip it off balance.
Have you any ideas, Dad?
All personnel and vehicles to proceed to rendezvous ''G'' immediately.
This is an emergency.
Repeat: This is an emergency.
We need a solution,
Gordon, and quick.
As far as l can tell... the only way we're going to get them off that tower... in one piece is to get a vehicle on that top deck.
Nothing we've got would be any good, Dad.
Our machines are too heavy. l know. l know.
We need something light,
Iow air speed... high maneuverability, short landing distance.
Say, l've got the answer, Dad! lt's crazy, but it could work.
Hey, what's going on?
Thunderbird 2 is leaving.
Don't tell me they've given up.
That's right, Mr. Tracy.
We've got it aboard
Thunderbird 2... and they just left.
We did all the necessary checks and fueled it. l certainly hope it works. lt's just got to work.
It's just got to.
The top of the tower is crumbling. l'm going to attach a line... to the front of the ship to see if l can hold it steady.
F.A.B.
What the heck are they doing?
Why don't they come in and get us off this thing?
You saw what happened when they came in close.
Well, what are they going to do? lf you let me call them, l can find out.
Oh, no, you don't! l'm not falling into that little trap.
OH, Dad. Line secured. l think it's going to help.
Thunderbird 1, from Thunderbird 2.
One mile from you. l'm landed on a grassy stretch down below.
Well done, Virg.
That was a quick trip.
Yeah, well, you see... l've got a Tiger in my tank.
OH, Brains, over to you.
Scott and Virgil... l'm going to circle the ship... and then attempt a landing.
OH, Brains. lf you make it, the order of evacuation... will be first, Tin Tin, second, Penelope... then the crew, and finally,
Parker and Alan.
F.A.B.
Right, Scott, l'm in position.
Brains is on his way up. l'm going to fix a line to this end.
OH, Virg.
Still no radio contact with Skyship 1. l just don't understand it.
Something must be wrong.
We'll soon find out.
Attaching line.
Don't tell me they're going to try a rescue with that thing.
They must've got it from a museum.
You're dead right,
Mr. Foster.
But l'll tell you something.
It's a brilliant idea. l think it's the only chance we've got.
Lane, Get over on the other side of the deck.
Get ready to welcome our guest.
Right.
Brains!
Scott, that was a close one.
Are you OH, Brains?
OH. Climbing for second attempt.
Brains, you're not going to make it.
As soon as you touch down, l'll open up with my jets.
The slipstream should slow you down.
Right. Let's try it.
F.A.B.
Penelope and Alan, in a few moments... l'm going to open up my jet engines.
Hold tight to that rail.
Alan, raise your hand if you've understood me.
OH, folks, hold tight!
Well done, Brains.
OH. Tin Tin, you're first.
Jump aboard.
Oh, no, you don't.
Get out of that cockpit and move!
Scott, one of the stewards has got Brains at gunpoint.
Now we know why there's been no radio communication.
What're they going to do, Virg?
Looks as if Penelope is boarding the aircraft.
And the Captain's getting into the rear cockpit.
OH. Turn this crate around.
What's happened to Brains?
Everyone's moving towards the Tiger.
There's no doubt about it.
The crew is in control of the situation.
Things look bad, Dad.
Guys, hold it a minute.
Come on! Hurry it up!
Get back fast! This thing's going to collapse any moment!
What makes you think l'm coming back?
Double-crosser!
We've got to stop him!
Quick! Jump aboard!
Come on!
We're going to crash!
We're just overloaded.
That's all.
Watch out for trees!
Penelope, throttle back.
Thunderbird to base.
Father, we're not going to be able to hold her much longer.
How's the evacuation... of the rocket site progressing?
Nearly complete... but they want about another 5 minutes.
Do everything you can, Scott... to prevent that ship falling.
Penelope, throttle back.
We're down!
Where's the throttle?
Down on the left hand side.
Throttle back.
Penny, throttle back.
Penny, that's the wrong way.
Alan, it's jammed. l can't move it.
Alan, l can't free it.
What shall l do?
Get her nose up! Quickly!
Don't panic.
Alan, there's another bridge ahead.
Pull...up!
Pull the stick back.
Pull it back! Penelope...
Hold the rudder steady,
Penelope.
Alan, obstruction ahead.
Alan!
Alan!
This is it!
All personnel and vehicles... should by now be clear of sectors ''A'' to ''Q.''
Danger imminent. l repeat: Danger imminent.
Thunderbird 1?
Loud and clear.
Scott, l just received the OH from the missile base.
Evacuation has been completed.
You can let her go.
Right.
Did you hear that, Virgil? l heard.
OH. Release cables on 5 second countdown.
F.A.B.
Zero! l want to get into the rear cockpit, Penelope.
But first, we've got to get rid of Foster.
Hold tight, Tin Tin.
Hold tight, Tin Tin.
OH, Alan.
Hold tight, Brains.
OH, Penny, push the stick over to the left.
OH. Heep us steady, Penny. l'm getting into the rear cockpit now.
Alan, l've only just realized
Parker isn't with us.
We must've left him aboard the airship. lt's too late now, Penny.
Anyway, a few moments from now... we may be sharing the same fate.
That's our engine gone, Penny.
Hold tight.
Hold tight, Tin Tin. l'm putting her down.
OH, Alan.
Hold tight, Brains.
Emergency landing.
Good luck, Alan.
Hey, Tin Tin! l still say, Alan, that was a fantastic landing.
Well, if it hadn't been for Parker... we could've said we'd got away with it.
Are you sure there was no chance of him surviving... when Skyship 1 crashed?
Not a chance, Alan. l suppose it must be shock... but a few moments ago, l'm sure l heard... a distant voice calling, ''Milady.''
That's funny. l thought l heard it, too.
Milady!
Milady!
And now, it gives me great pleasure... to introduce to you all... my new vehicle--
Thunderbird 6.
Thunderbird 6? l don't get it.
Oh. l know what you're going to say, Mr. Tracy.
That you haven't approved the plans... how could it have been built anyway... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
But, nevertheless, l present to you...
Thunderbird 6.
Built, tested, and approved.
This is
Thunderbird control.
Launch Thunderbird 6.
Brains! Ha ha.
Well, l'll be a...
Look at that.
Brains, you old son of a gun. l'll buy it. l agree it's a good design.
It has been built... and it sure has been tested.
Guenevere, Guenevere.
In that dim, mournful year.
Saw the men she held so dear.
Go to war for Guenevere.
The rules of battle are not for
Lancelot du Lac, Your Majesty.
Let us attack now while they sleep.
We will attack when
I give the command, at dawn.
Merlyn... why is Jenny in that castle... behind walls I cannot enter?
How did I blunder into this... agonizing absurdity?
When did I stumble?
Where did I go wrong?
Should I not have loved her?
Then I should not have been... born.
Oh, Merlyn... how did it happen?
I haven't got much time.
A thin inch of sunlight... the arrows begin to fly.
Merlyn... if I am to die... in battle... please do not let me die... bewildered.
Think, Arthur.
Think back.
Think back.
Think back!
Oh, Merlyn!
Think back.
Think back!
Think... back.
Back! To one of the most important days of your life.
Oh, yes!
Hello.
My name is Arthur.
I think I'll call you...
Wart.
""I think I'll call you Wart.""
No, no, no!
Now you've gone too far back.
Not the day you met me!
The day you met Guenevere.
The day she came... to Camelot.
That's the beginning.
Yes.
I know... what my people... are thinking tonight.
I know what my people are thinking tonight.
As home through the shadows they wander.
Everyone smiling in secret delight.
As they stare at the castle and ponder.
Whenever the wind blows this way.
You can almost hear everyone say...
I wonder what the king is doing tonight.
What merriment is the king pursuing tonight?
The candles at the court
They never burned as bright
I wonder what the King is up to tonight.
How goes the final hour
As he sees the bridal bower.
Being legally and regally prepared?
Well, I'll tell you what the king is doing tonight.
He's scared Oh, he's scared.
You mean that a king who fought a dragon
Whacked him in two and fixed his wagon.
Goes to wed in terror and distress?
Oh, yes!
A warrior who's so calm in battle
Even his armor doesn't rattle.
Faces a woman petrified with fright?
Right!
You mean the appalling clamoring
That sounds like a blacksmith hammering.
Is merely the banging of his royal knees?
Please!
You wonder what the King is wishing tonight?
He's wishing he were in Scotland fishing tonight.
What occupies his time
While waiting for his bride?
He's searching high and low
For some place to hide.
And, oh, the expectation,
The sublime anticipation.
He must feel about the wedding night to come.
Well, I'll tell you what the King is feeling tonight.
He's numb! He shakes!
He quails! He quakes!
And that's what the King is doing.
Tonight!
How long before we get to Camelot?
Soon, Ma'am, but don't look out there, it's a ghastly forest.
It's the most ferocious, savage... terrifying forest I've ever seen.
I simply adore it.
Does Your Ladyship not realize that this forest is crawling... with outlaws and brigands?
Clary! You think there's a chance of meeting one?
Don't say it, Ma'am.
It would be marvelous.
Imagine, Ma'am, soon you will not only meet the man you will marry... but His Majesty,
King Arthur of England.
And one is the other.
What have you to say to that?
Was there ever a more inconvenient marriage of convenience?
I am at the golden age of seductability, and is my fate sealed with a kiss?
Is it? No, sealed with a seal!
Where are all the simple joys of maidenhood?
Where are all those adoring, daring boys?
Where's the knight pining so for me?
He leaps to death in woe for me.
Oh where are a maiden's simple joys?
Shan't I have the normal life a maiden should?
Shall I never be rescued in the wood?
Shall two knights never tilt for me.
And let their blood be spilt for me?
Oh, where are the simple joys.
Of maidenhood?
Shall I never be disputed for.
Or on any minstrel's lips?
Never have my face recruited for.
Launching countless ships?
Where are the simple joys of maidenhood?
Are those sweet, gentle pleasures gone for good?
Shall a feud not begin for me?
Shall kith not kill their kin for me?
Oh where are the trivial joys?
Harmless, convivial joys?
Where are the simple joys.
Of maidenhood?
Halt!
Her Highness will rest here while the Royal Hairdresser... attends her.
Can someone help with this canopy?
I should like some tea while I'm being coifed.
St. Genevieve.
It's Guenevere.
Remember me?
St. Genevieve
I'm over here, beneath this tree!
You know how faithful and devout I am.
You must admit I've always been a lamb.
But Genevieve, St. Genevieve.
I won't obey you any more
You've gone a bit too far
I won't be bid and bargained for
Like beads at a bazaar.
St. Genevieve, I've run away
Eluded them and fled.
And from now on I intend
To pray to someone else instead.
Oh, Genevieve, St. Genevieve.
Where were you when my youth was sold?
Dear Genevieve.
Sweet Genevieve.
Shan't I be young before I'm old?
A thousand pardons, my lady.
Don't run, I won't harm you.
You lie! You'll leap on me and throw me down!
I'll do no such thing.
You'll carry me off on your shoulder!
No, I swear by the sword Excalibur
I won't touch you.
Why not?
How dare you insult me in this fashion?
Do my looks repel you?
- No, you're beautiful!
- Did you hear me praying?
I couldn't help it.
You did pray loudly.
So you know who I am?
Yes, you're Guenevere.
So that accounts for your polite, respectful, despicable behavior?
Why isn't Merlyn here?
- Who?
- Merlyn. He's my teacher.
He's the wisest man alive. He'd know what to do. He lives backwards.
- Beg your pardon?
- He lives backwards.
He doesn't age. He... youthens?
He can remember the future... so he can tell you what you'll do in it.
Come here.
Close your eyes.
Please.
Now just turn, gently.
Very slowly, open them.
Do you see that castle?
It used to light up in a sort of pink glow.
When I was young, everything looked a little pink to me.
When Merlyn left, he took all the pink with him.
Don't stare. It's rude.
Who are you?
Actually, they call me Wart, actually.
- You sure you heard them properly?
- It's a nickname. Merlyn gave it to me.
Is it really Wart?
Why don't you run away with me?
You could be my protector, defend me all over the world... in France, in England,
Mongolia, Scotland.
What a wonderful dream you spin.
And how easy it would be for me to be caught up in it.
But...
I must decline.
You forcing me to stay?
Oh, no, My Lady!
If you persist in escaping, I'll find somebody brave to accompany you.
Then do so at once before your wretched king finds me.
Do look around you, My Lady!
Reconsider.
Camelot is unique.
And we have, by far and away, the most equable climate in all England.
Ordained by decree.
Oh, come now!
It's true.
It's true!
The Crown has made it clear.
The climate must be perfect.
All the year.
A law was made a distant moon ago here
July and August cannot be too hot.
And there's a legal limit to the snow here.
In Camelot.
The winter is forbidden till December.
And exits March the second on the dot.
By order, summer lingers through September.
In Camelot
Camelot.
I know it sounds a bit bizarre.
But in Camelot.
That's how conditions are.
The rain may never fall till after sundown.
By eight the morning fog must disappear.
In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot.
For happily-ever-aftering.
Than here in Camelot.
And I suppose the autumn leaves fall into neat little piles?
No, My Lady.
They blow away completely.
At night, of course.
I know it gives a person pause.
But in Camelot.
Those are the legal laws.
The snow may never slush upon the hillside.
By nine p.m. the moonlight must appear.
In short, there's simply not.
A more congenial spot.
For happily-ever-aftering.
Than here... in Camelot.
Look! There, on the hill!
I'm truly sorry, but...
I'm afraid, on account of me... you may be hanged!
Or burnt at the stake for abducting me!
That uncivilized king of yours will...
Defend yourself!
There she is!
But who's that peasant with her?
The king!
Wart, it's the king!
Your Majesty, forgive me.
I did not know it was you.
The king.
When I was a young lad of 18 years of age... our good king, Pendragon, died, leaving no one to succeed him... but a sword stuck through an anvil that stood on a stone.
Written on it, in gold letters, it said...
"" Who so pulleth this sword from this stone... is rightwise born
King of all England. ""
Many chaps tried to dislodge it, but they failed.
So finally, a great tournament was proclaimed for New Year's Day.
All the mightiest knights in England were assembled at one time to have... a go at the sword.
I went to London as squire to my cousin, Sir Kay.
On tournament day, Sir Kay found he had left his sword at home... and he gave me a shilling to fetch it.
Going through London,
I passed a square and saw a sword... rising out of a stone.
Not thinking very clearly...
I thought it was a war memorial.
So I decided to borrow it... and to save myself the trip.
So I... took the sword and... and I failed.
So I tried again.
And I failed again.
So, with all my might,
I closed my eyes... and I tried... one last time.
And, lo!
The sword moved in my hand.
And slowly... it slid out of the stone.
I heard... a great roar.
I opened my eyes.
The square was full of people saying:
""...Long live the king!
Long live... the king. ""
That's how I became king.
I never knew I would be.
I never wanted to be.
And since I am,
I've been ill at ease in my crown.
Until I dropped from the tree... and my eyes... beheld you.
And then, for the first time...
I felt like a king.
I was glad to be king.
And most astonishing of all,
I wanted to be the most heroic... the wisest, the most... splendid king ever to sit... on any throne.
If My Lady will follow me...
I'll find a proper companion... to accompany you.
I hear it never rains.
Till after sundown.
By eight the morning fog must disappear.
In short, there's simply not.
A more congenial spot.
For happily-ever-aftering than here...
In Camelot.
The map of England.
Map, indeed.
A fishnet of ill-begotten kingdoms ruled by immoral lords... battling with their own unlawful armies over illegal border lines.
And who is... king of this... jungle?
The man who 4 years ago pledged he would become... the greatest king who ever sat on any throne.
I...
Arthur of England.
Yes.
The greatest warrior in the land.
For what purpose?
Might... doesn't always mean right.
What are you saying? To be right and lose couldn't possibly be right.
Merlyn... used to frown on battles.
Yet he always... helped me win them.
Why?
Proposition:
Is it far better to be alive than dead?
Yes, far better.
If that is so... then why do we have wars... in which people can get killed?
I don't know, do you?
Yes.
Because somebody attacks.
Why do they attack?
Did I ever tell you... how Merlyn taught me how to think?
No.
By changing me into animals.
Oh, really! Arthur!
Jenny, I mean by making me believe... he had changed me into animals.
For instance, when a hawk is up there looking down at the world... there are no boundaries.
Right?
Yet boundaries are what somebody always attacks about.
And you win by pushing them back across something that... that doesn't exist.
So we have battles for no reason at all.
Why, Jenny, why?
Because ladies love knights.
To see your knight in armor...
That's it, Jenny.
Jenny, that is it!
It's the armor!
It's the armor, Jenny.
The armor.
Only the knights are rich enough to have armor. The foot soldiers...
Well, they have nothing.
So, all that can happen to a knight is... an occasional... dent.
Proposition:
Right or wrong... if they have the might.
So right or wrong, they're always right.
That's wrong. Right?
I'm here.
Suppose we create a new order of chivalry?
A new order where might is only used for right.
To improve instead of to destroy.
We'll invite all knights... and kings of all kingdoms to lay down their arms to come and join us.
Oh, yes, Jenny.
And we'll... take one of the large rooms in the castle... put a table in it and all the knights will gather at it.
And do what?
Talk across it.
Debate.
Make laws. Plan improvements.
But, Arthur, do you think all the knights will ever want to... to do such a ridiculously peaceful thing?
We'll make it a great honor.
Very fashionable.
Everyone will want to join.
Only now... the knights will whack only for good.
Might for right.
Might for right.
Might... for right!
That's it, Jenny!
Might...
No, not might is right!
Might... for... right!
It's very original.
And civilized, Jenny.
It will have to be an awfully large table.
What of jealousy? All will claim superiority and want to sit at the head.
We'll make it... a round table.
So there is no head.
A round table!
My father's got one that would be perfect. It seats 150.
He had it as a wedding present and he never used it.
We'll send the heralds
Riding through the country.
Tell every living person far and near.
That there is simply not.
In all the world a spot.
Where rules a more resplendent king.
Than here.
In Camelot
Camelot.
In far off France
I hear you call.
To you alone I'll give my all.
I know in my soul what you expect of me.
And all that and more I shall be.
A knight of the table round
Should be invincible.
Succeed where a less fantastic man
Would fail.
Climb a wall no one else can climb
Cleave a dragon in record time.
Swim a moat
In a coat of heavy iron mail.
No matter the pain
He ought to be unwinceable.
Impossible deeds
Should be his daily fare.
But where in the world.
Is there in the world.
A man so extraordinaire?
C'est moi, c'est moi
I'm forced to admit.
'Tis I I humbly reply.
That mortal who these marvels can do.
C'est moi, c'est moi 'Tis I
I've never lost
In battle or game
I'm simply the best by far.
When swords are crossed
'Tis always the same.
One blow and au revoir.
C'est moi, c'est moi
So admirably fit.
A French Prometheus Unbound.
And here am I With valor untold.
Exceptionally brave.
Amazingly bold.
To serve at the table round.
The soul of a knight
Should be a thing remarkable.
His heart and his mind
As pure as morning dew.
With a will and a self-restraint
That's the envy of every saint.
He could easily work a miracle or two.
To love and desire
He ought to be unsparkable.
The ways of the flesh
Should offer no allure.
But where in the world
Is there in the world.
A man so untouched.
And pure?
C'est moi I blush to disclose
I'm far too noble to lie.
That man in whom
These qualities bloom.
C'est moi, C'est moi 'Tis I
I've never strayed
From all I believe
I'm blessed with an iron will.
Had I been made
The partner of Eve.
We'd be in Eden still.
C'est moi, c'est moi
The angels have chosen.
To fight their battles below.
And here am I
As pure as a prayer.
Incredibly clean.
With virtue to spare.
The godliest man I know
C'est moi!
Oh, King Arthur!
What caliber of man you must be... to have envisioned a new order of life.
I worship you before knowing you.
Don't run away, coward!
Come back and fight!
The swine!
- Are you hurt, Your Majesty?
- Fine.
Please!
The next time you traffic with me... remember, you challenge the right arm of King Arthur.
Really?
I am King Arthur.
What?
You... are the king!
Yes, almost the late king.
And I struck you?
Your Majesty!
I'm Lancelot du Lac.
In France I heard of your new order and came to join.
I beg Your Majesty to forgive me.
Not because I deserve it... but because by forgiving me...
I'll suffer more.
But, really, dear chap...
I don't want you to suffer at all.
I want to congratulate you.
Please rise. You, too, squire.
I can't, mon roi.
- I'm too ashamed to lift my head.
- Well, then I command you.
I have never felt a bash in my chest quite like it.
It was most spectacular.
Where did you learn to do it?
My skill comes from training, mon Roi.
My strength from purity.
Well, that's a unique recipe.
He's a unique man, Your Majesty.
At the age of fourteen he could defeat any jouster in France.
His father, King Ban, made me his squire.
King Ban?
In France?
What did you say your name was?
Lancelot du Lac, Your Majesty.
You're Lancelot?
I was told you were coming.
You were told?
By Merlyn, the court magician.
He said to me one day...
"" Keep your eye out for a Frenchman called Lancelot du Lac.
He will come to the court of Camelot and he will be... ""
What was it now?
""He will be...""
Your ally, if you'll take me.
Your friend, who asks no friendship.
Your defender when you need one... whose body is your sword to brandish.
Did he prophesy that, Your Majesty?
For all that, I am.
Really, my dear fellow... this is far more than I could wish for... or even ask.
Then you will accept me?
Without hesitation.
- We will arrange for your knighthood.
- Oh, thank you!
We must arrange for your knighthood immediately.
No, Your Majesty.
All you know of me is words.
Invest me because of deeds, sire.
Give me an order.
- Now?
- This moment.
Send me on a mission.
Is there some wrong I can right?
Some enemy I can battle?
Some peril I can undertake?
Well, actually, there's not much going on today.
It's the first of May. The Queen and some of the court have gone a-Maying.
Gone a-Maying?
Yes, it's a sort of... picnic?
They eat berries and chase young girls around...
It's a custom we have here.
This is England, you know.
And this is the season for gathering flowers.
Knights gathering flowers?
Well, someone has to do it!
And besides, it's...
It's civilized.
And civilization should have... a few gentle hobbies.
Come.
I want you to meet the queen.
Dap, take the horses and feed them.
By George!
I suddenly remembered what Merlyn said of you.
How strange!
He said that you would be the greatest knight ever to sit at my table.
That was long before
I thought of a table.
So he knew it would exist.
Oh, dear!
I thought he meant a dining table.
But he meant this.
The Round Table!
And I have stumbled on my future.
I've done... the right thing.
Did you ever doubt it, Your Majesty?
Of course.
Only fools... never doubt.
Welcome, Lancelot.
Bless you for coming.
Welcome to my table.
It's May.
It's May.
The lusty month of May.
That lovely month.
When everyone goes.
Blissfully astray.
It's here, it's here.
That shocking time of year.
When tons of wicked little thoughts.
Merrily appear.
It's May!
That gorgeous holiday.
When every maiden itches for fun.
Wholesome or ""un"".
It's mad!
Depraved in every way.
Those dreary vows that everyone takes
Everyone breaks.
Everyone makes divine mistakes.
The lusty month of May.
The lusty month of May.
That darling month when everyone throws.
Self-control away.
It's time to do.
A wretched thing or two.
And try to make each precious day.
One you'll always rue.
The month of ""Yes, you may.""
A time for every.
Frivolous whim.
Proper or ""im.""
It's wild!
It's wild! It's gay!
A libelous display.
The birds and bees.
Will all of their vast
Amorous past.
Gaze at the human race Aghast!
The lusty.
Month of May!
Now then... which way to go?
North.
No, no, that's north.
No, that's north.
I'm completely lost.
Who's that rusty old fellow?
I've never seen him before,
Your Majesty.
Offer him assistance.
That mountain seems familiar.
Let's see.
Good day, my lord.
How do you do, young man.
The name of King Pellinore here.
You are a king, sire?
Of what country?
I don't know. I lost my kingdom.
To whom?
Well, I mislaid it.
I left it somewhere and I...
I can't find my way back.
- Why, I believe him.
- Your Majesty!
Your Majesty?
Yes, my lord. You are addressing
Her Majesty, the Queen of England.
The queen?
Why, why! How do you do?
Forgive me, Ma'am.
The beastly hinges need oiling.
Be at ease, my lord.
Welcome to Camelot.
Haven't I been here before?
Yes, years ago. I spent a jolly fortnight with a fine little fellow... called Wart.
Ever met him, Ma'am?
Constantly. He's my husband.
King Arthur of England.
The King? Is he?
Well, well! Is he?
By Jove, good for him!
That's what I call well done.
Imagine. The king!
And he knows the name of what he's king of.
Arthur would be pleased to see you.
Would you care to spend the night?
What, in a bed? In a real bed?
Damnation, I'd like that.
I haven't put spine to feathers since I left...
Since I left...
Go, one of you.
Escort His Majesty to the castle.
I'm very grateful to you, Ma'am.
Thank you, very much.
I want to present to you
Lancelot du Lac.
He's come all the way from France to join our Table.
This is the Lancelot that Merlyn used to speak of.
You're most welcome.
I'm honored to be among you, milady.
And allow me to pledge my eternal dedication to this noble cause.
Thank you, monsieur.
Arthur, I met this strange man...
This splendid dream must become a universal reality.
What?
Absolutely. It really must.
I have assured the king he may call upon me... at any time to perform any deed, no matter the danger.
Thank you, monsieur.
That's most comforting.
I'm always on duty.
Yes, I can see that.
I would love to come to lunch... but I want to listen to the plans that we have been discussing.
Explain it.
- To the queen, sire?
- Yes, of course.
Would not Madame find it tedious?
I have never found chivalry tedious.
So far.
May I remind you... that the Round Table happens to be the idea of my husband.
My husband's idea.
Any idea, milady... however exalted, could be improved.
- Really?
- Of course.
I've suggested that we create a training program for knights.
- Isn't that a marvelous idea, Jenny?
- A training program?
The Round Table must have a standard.
A standard physical and a standard moral.
And whose abilities would serve as a standard, monsieur?
Oh, certainly not mine, milady.
It would not be fair.
Not fair? In what way?
I would never ask anyone to live by my standards, milady.
To devote your life... to the tortured quest for perfection in body and spirit.
I would not ask that of anyone.
No, nor would I.
And have you achieved perfection, monsieur?
Physically, yes, milady.
But the refining of the soul is an endless struggle.
I dare say. I do daresay.
Do you mean you've never been defeated in battle or in a tournament?
No, Your Majesty.
And I gather... you consider it unlikely ever to happen in the future?
Highly, Your Majesty!
How was the channel, Lancelot?
Was it a good crossing?
Tell me a little of your struggle for the perfection of the spirit.
Have you jousted with humility lately?
""Humility,"" milady?
Humilité.
Or isn't it fashionable in France this year?
We had best discuss the program elsewhere. You look too beautiful... to have anything on your mind other than frolic and flowers.
Have a lovely day.
Same to all of you.
Come along, Lancelot.
Come quickly.
Good day, my queen.
- Mon dieu, he's unpleasant.
- And so poisonously good.
He probably walked across the channel.
Sir Dinadan?
When is the next tournament?
A week from Saturday, Your Majesty.
And who are the 3 best jousters we have?
Sir Lionel, Sir Sagramore... and with all humilitay...
I, Your Majesty.
Really?
Sir Lionel?
Do you recall the other night
That I distinctly said you might.
Serve as my escort
At the next town fair?
Well, I'm afraid there's someone
Who I must invite in place of you.
Someone who plainly is
Beyond compare.
The Frenchman's power is more tremendous.
Than I have ever seen anywhere.
And when a man is that stupendous.
He, by right, should take me
To the fair.
Your Majesty, let me tilt with him
And smite him.
Don't refuse me so abruptly
I implore.
Oh, give me the opportunity
To fight him.
And Gaul will be divided
Once more.
You will bash and thrash him?
I will smash and mash him!
You'll give him trouble?
He will be rubble.
A mighty whack?
His skull will crack!
Then you may.
Take me to the fair.
If you do all the things
You promise.
In fact, my heart will break
Should you not take me.
To the fair.
Sir Sagramore?
I have some rather painful news
Relative to the subject who's.
To be beside me at the next court ball.
You were the chosen one, I know
But it's tradition it should go.
To the unquestioned champion
In the hall.
And I'm convinced
That splendid Frenchman.
Can easily conquer one and all.
And besting all our local
Henchmen, he.
Should sit beside me At the ball.
I beg of you, Ma'am
Withhold your invitation.
I swear to you this challenge
Will be met.
And when I have finished up
The operation.
I shall serve him to Your Highness
En brochette.
You'll pierce right through him?
I'll barbecue him!
A wicked thrust?
It will be dust to dust.
From fore to aft?
He'll feel... a draft.
My goodness!
You may sit.
By me at the ball.
If you demolish him In battle.
In fact, I know I'd cry
Were you not by me.
At the ball.
Sir Dinadan?
Didn't I promise that you may
Guide me to London on the day.
That I go up to judge
The cattle show.
As it is quite a nasty ride
There must be someone by my side.
Who'II be defending me
From beast and foe.
So when I choose whom I prefer go.
I take the strongest knight I know.
And young du Lac seems strongest
Ergo.
He should.
Take me to the cattle show.
Your Majesty can't believe
This blustering prattle.
Let him prove it
With a sword or lance instead.
I promise you when I'm done
This gory battle.
His shoulders will be lonesome
For his head.
You'll disconnect him?
I'll vivisect him!
You'll open wide him?
I'll subdivide him!
Then you may guide me
To the show.
If you can carry out
Your program.
In fact, I'd grieve inside
Should you not guide me.
To the show.
Milady, We shall put an end to.
That Gallic bag of noise
And nerve.
When we do all that we Intend to.
He'll be a plate of French
Hors d'oeuvres.
I do applaud your noble goals.
Now let us see if you
Achieve them.
And if you do
Then you will be the three.
Who will go to the ball
To the show.
And take me.
To the fair.
My lords!
Have you seen the latest edict?
Tis the final straw.
Knights who refuse to lay down their arms will be attacked... as if they were serfs.
We're not only to kill foot soldiers, but knights as well.
We know all about it, Dinadan.
But these other knights... if they fight back... we could be killed.
What's the sense of being born in the upper class... if you can get killed like the lower class?
It has the stink of French cooking.
After Saturday... we shall be back on Yorkshire pudding.
Pelly, why don't you... give up searching for your kingdom... and come settle down with us for good?
That's jolly kind of you, Arthur.
I mean, I love the bed and all that... but the truth is I don't find things too restful around here.
I can't help wishing that you'd stop... thinking... and leave well enough alone.
I'm all against these new ideas of yours.
Any new ideas.
Best people whacking best people.
That's not right. That's not.
The chaps downstairs, they're gnashing mad.
Gnashing.
It's all his fault, you know.
Emperor Charlemagne there.
He has no activities, that's his trouble.
No secular pleasures.
Quiet, Pelly!
But do you not have any activities?
Any hobbies? Any... chambre à coucher?
No, Pellinore.
There, you see. Do you see?
Now why can't he be like the other chaps instead of like himself?
Why can't he come home of an evening, hang up his shield... and do something that he can be ashamed of?
You sure he's French?
I'm afraid my lord is right.
All fanatics are irritating, Pellinore.
And I am a fanatic.
And I don't enjoy it any more than you do.
Didn't you have a change to suggest?
We can discuss my idea tomorrow.
If you will excuse me.
While I was napping, did I miss any improvements in chivalry?
No, milady.
If you will excuse me...
Monsieur, when you're arranging things with God tonight... do be sure to give us fine weather tomorrow.
Good night, sire.
Good night, Pellinore.
Good night.
Heard the latest? He believes his purity gives him miraculous powers.
He was undoubtedly referring to his physical prowess.
Which is vast, indeed.
We'll see about that tomorrow.
Sagramore, Lionel and Dinadan have all challenged him to a joust.
Three damn strong men!
- All three in one day?!
- Quite, exactly.
Isn't it marvelous? Marvelous!
Exactly, yes!
I tell you, Arthur.
I've never met anyone like him.
I mean... he has no lady.
Talks to no one but you and God... crammed full of religion, an all-around unpleasant fellow.
I can't wait until tomorrow.
It'll be a jolly massacre.
Good night, Ma'am.
I'm really looking forward to it.
It's going to be marvelous.
A note of thanks from Sir Lionel.
I've promised he can carry my kerchief in the joust tomorrow.
I would be most grateful if you... would withdraw your permission from Sir Lionel.
I don't think I could.
It would be rather awkward.
Then allow Lancelot to carry it against Sagramore.
- I've promised my kerchief to him.
- Then against Dinadan?
I've promised him too.
He asked so prettily, I couldn't refuse.
This is appalling!
It will seem to the court that you are championing his defeat.
Perhaps he won't be. He knocked you unconscious. You became friends.
He may knock them out, and they'll all take a house together.
I realize he's having a difficult time adjusting.
But he's a stranger.
He's not even English.
He's French.
Well, he suffers in translation.
I ask you...
I believe you're jealous of the knights and their attentions to me.
Jealous? What absolute rubbish!
You know I am delighted the court adores you so.
I trust you as God above.
You have dragged me off the subject and I want you back on it.
Will you withdraw those kerchiefs?
Only if you command me as king.
If I do... will you forgive me?
Never.
Then, if I ask you as a husband, will you as a favor?
I find him overbearing and pretentious.
The knights are against him.
Can we not stay on the subject?
There's nothing more to be said.
If the king wishes me to withdraw what I have given... let him command me and Yours Humbly will graciously obey.
Blast you, Merlyn!
This is all your fault!
You swore that you had taught me
Everything from A to Z.
With nary an omission in between.
Well, I shall tell you what
You obviously forgot.
That's how a ruler rules a queen.
And what of teaching me
By turning me to animal and bird.
From beaver
To the smallest bobolink?
I should have had a whirl
At changing to a girl.
To learn the way the creatures think.
But wasn't there a night.
On a summer long gone by.
We passed a couple
Wrangling away.
And did I not say.
Merlyn What if that chap were I.
And did he not give counsel
And say.
What was it now?
Oh, my mind's a wall.
Oh, yes! By Jove!
Now I recall.
How to handle a woman.
There's a way
Said the wise old man.
A way known by every woman.
Since the whole rigmarole began.
Do I flatter her
I begged him answer.
Do I threaten or cajole or plead.
Do I brood or play the gay romancer.
Said he, smiling No, indeed!
How to handle a woman
Mark me well
I will tell you, sir.
The way to handle a woman.
Is to love her.
Simply.
Love her.
Merely love her.
Love her.
What's wrong, Jenny?
Where are you these days?
What are you thinking?
I don't understand you.
But no matter.
Merlyn told me once...
""Never be disturbed if you don't understand what a woman is thinking.""
""They don't do it very often.""
But what do you do while they're doing it?
How to handle a woman
Mark me well
And I'll tell you, sir.
The way to handle a woman.
Is to love her.
Simply.
Love her.
Merely love her.
Love her.
Just... love her.
Here comes Sir Lionel.
One.
Watch the way Sir Sagramore maneuvers his horse. It's extraordinary.
You see how he drives to the right?
And then suddenly...
How clever!
He maneuvered his horse right out from under himself.
What control!
Two, Jenny.
He's dead, Jenny.
Please!
Live!
Live!
I beg you.
He lives!
I'm trembling with fear.
And the strength... has left my arms.
And terrible feelings... burn within me.
Tell me.
You're older than I.
You know this earth... better than I.
I only fell upon it... a few hours ago.
What are you talking about?
Guenevere.
Wait, Pelly.
You've never been in love... have you, Pelly?
Once.
But not lately.
Now I'm not young enough.
Or not old enough.
And I'm too young and too old.
Too old not to know that fears... can be imaginary.
And too young not to be... tormented by them.
Forgive me, milady, for disturbing you.
Clarinda told me
Arthur was expected here.
Yes, he is.
I love you.
God forgive me... but I do!
Then God forgive us both, Lance.
What a glorious day!
This is your day, Lance.
And at last you shall receive... your earned and proper knighthood.
Unfortunately, sainthood is not in my power.
Before the ceremony, we three will have a nice quiet drink together.
It was on such a day as this... that the idea of the Round Table was given birth.
Remember, Jenny?
To the Round Table!
To be invested...
Knight of the Round Table of England... of the Castle of Joyous Gard...
Lancelot du Lac.
Excalibur.
Arise...
Sir Lancelot.
Proposition:
If I could choose... from every woman who breathes on this earth... the face I would most love... the smile, the touch, the heart... the voice, the laugh, the soul itself... every detail and feature to the last strand of the hair... they would all be Jenny's.
Proposition:
If I could choose from every man who breathes on this earth... a man for my brother... a man for my son... and a man for my friend... they would all be Lance.
I love them.
I love them and they answer me with pain... and torment.
Be it sin or not sin... they have betrayed me in their hearts... and that's far sin enough.
I can see it in their eyes.
I can feel it when they speak.
And they must pay for it and be punished.
I shall not be wounded and not return it in kind.
I'm through with feeble hoping.
I demand... a man's vengeance!
Proposition:
I'm a king... not a man.
And a very civilized king.
Could it... possibly be civilized... to destroy the thing I love?
Could it possibly be civilized to love myself above all?
What about their pain... and their torment?
Did they ask for this calamity?
Can passion... be selected?
Is there any doubt... of their devotion to me, and to our Table?
By God...
I shall be a king!
This is the time of King Arthur... when we shall... reach for the stars!
This is the time of King Arthur... when violence is not strength, and compassion is not weakness.
We are civilized!
Resolved:
We shall live through this together!
Excalibur!
They... you... and I.
And may...
God have mercy on us all.
Your Majesty!
I come as an emissary from the village of Glenfield.
We have 23 shops... and not one door with a bolt.
And not a chain on a stable... a bar on a gate, a latch with a lock.
And our children walk free on the roads.
Because we live in the England of King Arthur.
Here are the keys of Glenfield,
Your Majesty.
We need them no more.
You have been the queen's lover for years.
Get on your feet... and defend your slander!
Does killing me kill the truth?
There's a poison in this court that will kill us all!
Get up and fight!
I give you this.
And I'll use dagger alone.
I... take it back.
If the king grants you clemency... you shall be banished.
If not, you hang.
Clemency is granted.
Is he dead?
Bruce has withdrawn the accusation.
And Arthur?
Clemency.
What an agony for him.
Seven of his knights banished.
If those charges had not been withdrawn... what would I have done?
Commit murder?
I don't know.
At least he's still spared the anguish of the truth.
He knows.
- I'm certain.
- He couldn't.
Arthur would never banish the knights so unjustly.
It's your conscience talking.
It's impatient for you to be punished.
He knows!
Well, why would he change the law?
Rule out the use of swords to settle disputes... and replace it with a court and judge?
- He hasn't done that.
- He's preparing to!
And if no evidence can be produced... then the matters cannot be disputed at all.
And there will be no evidence.
- He'll see to that.
- How?
He will never leave this castle unless one of us is with him.
He will never leave us alone again.
Never!
Oh, God!
What will become of us?
What will become of me?
How long can I... go on asking the same question and not lose my mind?
Or is my mind gone from me now?
What shall we do?
I know what I should do.
Leave and never come back.
Today. This minute.
But to leave so abruptly... it would seem a confession.
Better in a week or two.
Or a month.
How can I go, Jenny.
Look at you.
When would I?
If ever I would leave you.
It wouldn't be in summer.
Seeing you in summer
I never would go.
Your hair streaked with sunlight.
Your lips red as flame.
Your face with a luster.
That puts gold to shame.
But if I'd ever leave you.
It couldn't be in autumn.
How I'd leave in autumn
I never would know
I've seen how you sparkle.
When fall nips the air.
I know you in autumn.
And I must be there.
And I could leave you.
Running merrily through the snow.
Or on a wintery evening.
When you catch the fire's glow.
If ever I would leave you.
How could it be in springtime.
Knowing how in spring
I'm bewitched by you so.
Oh, no Not in springtime.
Summer, winter or fall.
No, never could I leave you.
At all.
I want you to go, Lance.
I do.
I don't worry about the future.
We have none.
But if anything happened to the past... any more shame... and any more guilt could make ruin of it.
The past is all I have.
If ever I would leave you.
How could it be in springtime.
Knowing how in spring
I'm bewitched by you so.
Oh, no Not in springtime.
Summer, winter or fall.
No, never could I leave you.
At all.
Damn it, Arthur!
Forgive me, damn it.
But damn it!
If this banishing goes on... there'II be more out there than there are in here.
There's a young man from Scotland who brings you royal greetings.
His Majesty is occupied.
Ask him to return in the afternoon.
The uglier the truth, the truer the friend that tells you... and unless you are told the truth... your Round Table is doomed.
Guenevere... and Lancelot... have betrayed you.
And because you don't know it... innocent men are being punished.
You will either... withdraw that treasonous allegation... at once... or defend it with your life!
Now speak up!
Which is it, Pellinore?
The sword or withdrawal?
Guard!
Wait!
I must have been mistaken, Sir.
Under this new civil law of mine you can... make that accusation again without fear of your life... if there is evidence, which there is not, of course.
Repetition, Pelly, is not evidence.
Brilliant, Your Majesty!
Not only wise but clever.
- How dare you enter unannounced?
- But I was announced.
And were you not informed to return this afternoon?
I'm busy this afternoon.
By Jove!
- What presumption!
- Don't touch me. I'm unarmed.
Pelly, call the guard and have this pompous young ass thrown out.
Yes, do.
Tell them His Majesty wants Mordred evicted.
Yes, Your Majesty.
I'm Mordred.
Wait, Pelly.
I know this boy.
He's... the brother... the half-brother...
He's the son... of the Princess Margause of Orkny.
Please.
This is the famous throne room where sits His Majesty, King of England.
It's quite handsome, really.
Marvelous for parties.
I had lost track of the time.
You've grown to manhood.
How... is your mother?
As ravishing as ever.
Which is hardly surprising.
Vigilant selfishness is wonderful for the skin.
And Prince Claudius?
I haven't seen him in a while.
He locked himself... in a tower 4 years ago to get away from Mother.
Do you always sit there, or do you sometimes switch with Guenevere?
Protocol intrigues me.
And where is the famous Lancelot?
Or does he stand in between?
What brings you to Camelot?
A desire of blood, Your Majesty.
My brothers are here.
Half-brothers.
They'll be very, very, very miserable to see me.
Mother had a potion which took off
10 years and they... gave it to me when I was 9 to make me minus one.
You've come all this way to see your brothers, whom you detest?
That's hardly reason for such a long journey.
There's you, Your Majesty.
I always wondered why old Claudius detested me so.
Then one day Mother told me the marvelous news.
He's not my father.
How once when she was visiting England... she met an attractive young lad called Arthur... invited him to her room... so on.
Is that how the story goes?
Yes, that's how the story goes.
Imagine her surprise when that young man became King of all England.
Now that you're here, what are your plans?
My plans are your wishes, Your Majesty.
Then you are to remain in Camelot and become a knight of the Round Table.
I admit you're not very promising material... but you have brains, youth... and a proper heritage.
Much could be done if you applied yourself.
I a knight?
Come, Your Majesty!
Look at me!
I despise the sword, I loathe the spear, and I detest horses.
I've been taught to place needs ahead of conscience... comfort ahead of principle.
I find charity offensive and kindness a trap.
I like my ladies married... my willpower weak, my wine strong... and my saints fallen.
Come.
What kind of knight could you make of me?
Put it that way, it would take a miracle.
And I'm told there's a shortage of miracles at Camelot these days.
I must warn you, Mordred... that I am a civilized man with occasional lapses.
And far more seasoned rascals than you have polished their souls.
I advise you get out the wax.
Better be rubbed clean... than rubbed out?
You will dine with the queen and me... and try to get to know each other better.
Good, I shall look forward to meeting the queen.
You will leave when you are dismissed.
And remember... that I and I alone shall decide... when you may address me by the name that your kinship allows.
But it shall remain unspoken... till you have earned the right by proper deeds.
The adage...
""Blood is thicker than water"" was invented by... undeserving relatives.
I look forward to seeing you tonight.
It is simple, Pellinore.
Once you get it into that armored head of yours... that all disputes will be settled by law... and not by bloodshed.
Wart, I understand that perfectly.
I do not understand how it works.
Let us see. Supposing you are accused of burning down a stable.
Whose?
Let us say a farmer named William.
I wouldn't, of course, but get along.
Now Pelly, you claim you haven't.
What does he do?
He holds his tongue if he knows what's good for him... or he'll get a sword through his chest.
Pelly, he takes you to court.
And we fight there.
In court, there is a prosecutor for Farmer William... and a defender for you.
Oh, I see!
I see. And they fight.
A jury decides.
That is why it is called ""trial by jury.""
The jury?
Who in thunderation are they?
It's none of their damn business.
But you don't know them, Pelly.
And they don't know you.
If they don't know me and they don't know Farmer William... how can you expect them to care a fig who wins?
How can you get a fair decision from people so impartial?
That is precisely the point, Pelly.
They are impartial and there will be no bloodshed.
If that jury finds me guilty, there'II be plenty of bloodshed.
I'll have a whack at every last one of them.
Then you will be charged with murder, Pelly.
The ruddy thing's endless!
Another jury finds me guilty, and I'll have to whack them... and so on and so on and whacking and...
Forget it!
You will never burn down a stable... you will never know a farmer named William and you will never... ever be found in a court.
Not without my ruddy sword, I won't.
Jenny, I'm getting old.
It's true.
I thought about it this morning.
I walked to the stables as briskly as ever... and arrived much later than I expected to.
You've been closeted far too long with the civil court.
I'm glad it's finally opening.
- The first English court.
- May I attend the ceremony?
Would you, Jenny?
Everyone would love it.
Yes, of course.
It may be our greatest achievement.
Good day, milady.
Good day, Lance.
Arthur, it's about Mordred.
Must we talk about Mordred?
This is the first day in a month he'll not be here for dinner... and that makes it seem like a party.
Get rid of him.
He's bent on the destruction of the Table.
He's setting knight against knight.
Making them yearn for their own lands.
Every evening like a witch over a cauldron he mixes wine and disloyalty.
I know of his activities, Lance.
Do you also know he is in constant touch with the knights you banished?
And they're raising an army.
I know.
And it is my own fault.
I should have officially recognized him when I took the throne.
It is the proper procedure.
I intended to do it and I should have done it.
But I didn't.
I couldn't.
I hadn't... counted on... caring for Jenny as much... and I had hoped that one day our child would sit... on the throne of England.
The fates... have not been kind.
The fates... must not have the last word, Lance.
We have been through much together, we three.
And by the sword, Excalibur, we will go through this.
Mordred is filled with hatred, trying to destroy those I love... and trying to make his inheritance come faster.
But we must not give him the opportunity.
We must not let... our passions destroy our dreams.
Let him cross my path.
I'll run him through.
You will not, Lance.
He's your mortal enemy!
He's my son.
He's all there is of me.
The only child I will ever have.
It may be madness, but somehow I hope that there is... something of me in him that I can reach.
So I will have your word, Lance?
You have my word.
Would you like to be alone, Arthur?
No, please. Please don't go.
What did you do today, Jenny?
Just trivial things.
That's exactly what I want to hear about.
Tempests and tea cups... mountains made out of molehills, anything.
Anything you can think of... that is not fit for a king.
What do the simple folk do.
To help them escape when they're blue.
The shepherd who is ailing
The milkmaid who is glum.
The cobbler who is wailing
From nailing his thumb.
When they're beset and besieged.
The folks not noblesse-Iy obliged.
However do they manage
To shed their weary lot.
Oh, what.
Do simple folk do.
We do not.
I have been informed
By those who know them well.
They find relief in quite a clever way.
When they're sorely pressed
They whistle for a spell.
And whistling seems
To brighten up their day.
And that's what.
Simple folk do.
So they say.
They just whistle?
So they say.
What else do the simple folk do.
To perk up the heart and get through?
The wee folk and the grown folk
Who wander to and fro.
Have ways known to their own folk
We throne-folk don't know.
When all the doldrums begin.
What keeps each of them in his skin.
What ancient native custom
Provides the needed glow.
Oh, what.
Do simple folk do?
Do you know?
Once along the road
I came upon a lad.
Singing in a voice
Three times his size.
And when I asked him why
He told me he was sad.
And singing always made his spirits rise.
So that's.
What simple folk do.
I surmise.
Arise, my love, arise my love
Apollo's lighting the skies, my love.
The meadows shine with columbine
And daffodils blossom away.
Hear Venus call to one and all
Come taste delight while you may.
The world is bright, and all is right
And life is merry and gay.
What else do the simple folk do?
They must have a system or two.
They obviously outshine us
At turning tears to mirth.
Have tricks a royal highness
Is minus from birth.
What, then, I wonder Do they.
To chase all the goblins away.
They have some tribal sorcery
You haven't mentioned yet.
Oh, what.
Do simple folk do.
To forget?
Often, I am told
They dance a fiery dance.
And whirl till they're
Completely uncontrolled.
Soon the mind is blank
And all are in a trance.
A violent trance astounding to behold.
And that's.
What simple folk do.
So I'm told.
- Really?
- I have it on the best authority.
Stop it!
For God's sake, stop it!
Through the clouds gray with years.
Over hills wet with tears.
To a world young and free.
We will fly Follow me
April green everywhere.
April's song always there.
Come and hear Come and see.
Follow me.
Merlyn's schoolhouse.
To a tree.
Where our hopes hang high.
To a dream that should never die.
Where our long lost tomorrows.
Still are in the sweet... bye and bye.
Time goes by Or do we.
Close your eyes And you'll see.
As we were We can be.
Weep no more Follow me.
Hello!
Hello...
Wart!
Hello...
Wart.
What's the best thing for being sad?
You taught me once.
The best thing for being sad is to learn something.
Learn something?
It's the one thing, Wart, that never fails.
You may grow old... and trembling in your arteries.
You may lie awake at night... listening to the disorder of your veins.
You may miss your father, your mother... your dog... your only love.
My love.
There's only one thing for all of it.
Learn.
Learn... why the world wags... and what wags it.
How could I learn if I couldn't think?
And I couldn't think, so I couldn't learn.
Not even to think the thought,
I thought.
But even the thought,
""I'm not thinking a thought""... is thinking, isn't it?
Thinking is something to get into the habit of making use of... as often as possible.
Thinking helps in everything.
Everything but love, that is.
Love is a sort of... seventh day.
So thinking can rest.
But this is not Sunday, so look down.
Look into the water, Wart.
Tell me what you see.
Water... fish and us.
Forget the water.
Forget us, and think of the fish.
Think yourself a fish.
Feel yourself a fish.
Breathe with your gills.
Be a fish.
Well, how do you like it?
How big a fish am I? I just saw a big fish chasing a smaller fish.
Am I the dinner or the diner?
Work it out. Think!
What are you learning as a fish?
Not very much. Big fish eat little fish, just like everywhere else.
Except somehow that doesn't seem right, does it?
Why couldn't I be a bird?
I would really enjoy being...
What am I?
You're a hawk!
Has the hunting season started?
By George, I believe it has!
I'm flying higher!
Look down. Tell me what you see.
I see lakes... trees, forests.
Can you see Camelot?
Yes, I can.
Can you see the next county?
Yes! I can see the middle of it.
It's Greylock Valley, but I can't see the edges of it.
You see the edges when you're down here?
Of course I can.
The boundaries are clearly marked.
Then what do you know as a hawk... that you don't know as Arthur?
Think!
I'm not thinking.
I'm just gliding!
Are you alone?
Not now.
Isn't this rather far from the palace for you, Mordred?
I wanted to see this legendary forest you've told me so much about.
This is where Merlyn taught you, is it not?
Yes, it is.
There are times when the only vacation spot in the world... is the past.
I can't quite remember all that Merlyn taught me, but I do remember this.
That happiness is a virtue.
No one can be... happy and wicked.
Triumphant, perhaps, but not happy.
If I could teach you that... and make you believe it... then at last, you could be my son.
Are you happy, Your Majesty?
Yes.
Is the queen?
Yes.
And Lancelot?
What are you implying?
Nothing, Your Majesty.
Simply that I did not realize... that deception and infidelity were candidates for the badge of virtue.
Whom are you accusing?
And of what crime?
And with what proof?
Isn't your Civil Law marvelous?
No proof, no crime.
Ergo:
Virtue, happiness.
You want me to be your son.
No more than I.
Then prove to me I'm wrong.
Stay in the forest tonight.
Give your son the lesson of this life.
Show him how virtue can triumph without the help of... fear?
Return to the palace... and inform the court... that His Majesty will be hunting all through the night... and will return... in the midmorning.
Yes... my lord.
Merlyn.
Where are you?
Merlyn...
Get to them.
Warn them.
Tell them to be wise.
My lords!
Both of you!
Are you drunk or mad!
Directly under the king's window!
The king's not there.
- He's away for the night.
- Where?
Hunting.
He'll be back at midmorning.
I must get back to the castle myself.
I must get back!
Jenny, come away with me.
To Joyous Gard.
Let's have it open and aboveboard.
I cannot live like this another day.
And this man we both love... what would you do, force him to declare war on you?
Where either you or he or both would be killed? And hundreds of others?
I never wanted to love you.
Your God arranged it.
Your God must solve it.
Arthur is my husband. I must stay with him as long as he wants me.
Then so be it, Jenny.
I will... never ask you again.
Nor shall I come to you again.
I swear it.
And I will never come to you again.
I loved you.
Once in silence.
And misery was all I knew.
Trying so.
To keep my love from showing.
All the while not knowing.
You loved me too.
Yes, loved me.
In lonesome silence.
Your heart.
Filled with dark despair.
Thinking love.
Would flame in you forever.
And I'd never, never.
Know the flame was there.
Then one day we cast away
Our secret longing.
The raging tide we held inside
Would hold no more.
The silence.
At last was broken.
We flung wide.
Our prison door.
Every joyous word of love.
Was spoken.
And now there's
Twice as much grief.
Twice the strain for us.
Twice the despair Twice the pain.
For us.
As we had known... before.
The silence.
At last was broken.
We flung wide Our prison door.
Every joyous word of love.
Was spoken.
And after all had been said.
Here we are, my love.
Silent once more.
And not far.
My love!
From where we were... before.
Don't reach for your dagger.
I accuse you of treason and order you both to stand trial... for your crime.
Surrender in the king's name.
Take him! Take him!
You cowards!
Guard! That man!
Oh, no!
Guenevere, Guenevere.
Oh they found Guenevere.
In the dying candle's gleam.
Came the sundown Of a dream.
On a day dark and drear.
Came to trial Guenevere.
Ruled the jury For her shame.
She will be sentenced
To the flame.
Verdict:
Guilty of treason against king and country.
Sentence:
To be burned
At the stake until death!
Guenevere, Guenevere.
Lance will save Guenevere.
Any moment he'll appear.
And he'll rescue Guenevere.
Five a.m. Oh, it's near.
Not a sound do I hear.
And the bells
Will soon ring clear.
Won't he rescue.
Guenevere?
Oh hurry, Lancelot, hurry
There isn't too much time.
Oh hurry, or soon those evil bells
In the tower will chime.
Oh hurry, the guard will soon
Be gathering around the stake.
And soon they will come
To take Guenevere.
Where is the King?
He's supposed to watch the execution.
He's supposed to be here, at this window. It's the law, isn't it?
Do you think for one moment
Lancelot will not rescue her?
But if he tries... that means that Arthur will have to fight him, won't he?
Is there no rescue in sight?
No, not yet, Sir.
Your Majesty, why not ignore... the verdict and pardon her?
But you can't do that, can you?
Let her die, your life is over.
Let her live, your life's a fraud.
Kill the queen or the law.
Wart!
I'm afraid... you must come to the window.
The executioner is waiting... for your signal.
- Is it Lancelot?
- I don't know.
Is it, Pelly?
It is!
Wart, my dear fellow... it is!
Sweet Heaven, what a sight!
Can you see it from there, Arthur?
Can you see your goodly Lancelot murdering your goodly knights?
Sire... most of the guard... is killed.
And over 80 knights.
They must be heading for the channel.
We'll make ready the army to follow.
We want revenge! Revenge!
Your table has cracked, Arthur.
Shall I save the timbers for her next stake?
Merlyn... make me a hawk.
Let me... fly away from here.
We want to return with you.
Let us pay for what we've done.
At the stake?
For what end? Justice?
They've forgotten justice.
They want revenge.
Revenge... the most worthless of causes.
It's too late.
The Table is dead.
It exists no more.
Half my knights were killed in the yard.
Mordred is organizing an army against me.
The rest of the knights are in their tents... itching for dawn, cheerful.
Cheerful to be at war.
It's those old uncivilized days... come back again.
Those days... those dreadful days that we tried... to put asleep forever.
It is your wish that this dread battle go on?
It is not my wish!
I can think no longer of what to do except to ride the tide of events.
Oh, what folly!
All we've been through... for nothing except an idea.
Something that you cannot taste... or touch, smell... or feel.
Without... substance, without life... reality... memory.
The charade will soon begin.
Please, please.
Please, go back to Joyous Gard.
Jenny is not at Joyous Gard.
She is with the Holy Sisters.
Is there nothing to be done?
There's nothing to be done... but to play out the game... and leave the decisions to God.
Go now, Lance.
You must go too, Jenny.
I know.
So often, in the past...
I would look in your eyes and I would find there forgiveness.
Perhaps one day, in the future... it shall be there again.
But I won't be with you.
I won't see it.
Goodbye... my love.
My dearest love.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Come out, I say!
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I was searching for the Sergeant of Arms and got lost.
I did not wish to disturb you.
Who are you?
Where did you come from?
You ought to be in bed.
Are you a page?
I stowed away on one of the boats, Your Majesty.
I came to fight for the Round Table.
I'm very good with a bow.
And do you intend to kill people with this bow of yours?
Oh, yes, my lord!
A great many, I hope!
But supposing that they... killed you?
Then I shall be dead, my lord.
But I don't intend to be dead.
I intend to be a knight!
A knight?
Yes, my lord.
Of the Round Table.
And when did you decide upon this extinct profession?
Was your village once protected by knights?
Did your father serve a knight?
Was your mother once saved by a knight?
Oh, no, my lord! I'd never even seen a knight until I stowed away.
I only know of them... the stories people tell!
From the stories people tell... you wish to become... a knight?
Now tell me, what do you think you know of the Knights of the Round Table?
I know everything, milord.
Might for right!
Right for right!
Justice for all!
A Round Table where all knights would sit.
Everything!
Come.
- What's your name?
- It is Tom, my lord.
- Where do you come from?
- From Warwick, my lord.
Now listen to me, Tom of Warwick.
You won't fight in the battle, understand?
Yes, my lord.
You will run behind the lines and hide until it is over.
And then you will return home... to England... alive.
To grow up... and grow old.
You understand?
You will remember... what I, the King, tell you... and do as I command.
Each evening.
From December to December.
Before you drift to sleep
Upon your cot.
Think back on all the tales
That you remember.
Of Camelot.
Ask every person
If he's heard the story.
And tell it strong and clear
If he has not.
That once there was
A fleeting wisp of glory.
Called Camelot.
Now say it out With love and joy.
Yes, Camelot... my boy.
Where once it never rained
Till after sundown.
By eight a.m. the morning fog had flown.
Don't let it be forgot.
That once there was a spot.
For one brief shining moment.
That was known as
Camelot!
Give me that sword.
Kneel, Tom.
With this sword Excalibur...
I knight you Sir Tom of Warwick.
And I command you... to return home... and carry out my orders.
Yes, my lord!
What are you doing?
You have a battle to fight.
I have won my battle, Pelly.
And here... is my victory!
What we did will be remembered.
You'll see.
Now run, Sir Tom.
Behind the lines!
Who was that?
One of what we all are, Pelly.
Less than a drop in the great blue motion of the sunlit sea.
But it seems that some of the drops sparkle!
Some of them do sparkle!
Run, boy!
Oh, run... my boy!
Long ago there lived a people, unique in all history, the Mayans.
Greece and Rome had become ancient legends in ancient books,
and the European civilizations had entered into the age of the barbarian.
But in the tropical jungles of Central America,
a civilization had burst into full flower.
Without metals, without horses, without wheels,
these incredible people built roads, pyramids,
temples worthy of ancient Egypt.
They charted the heavens,
devised a higher system of mathematics than the Romans,
and created a calendar as accurate as the one we use today.
But despite the maturity of their art and their science,
in the most important part of their lives,
the worship of their gods, they remained primitive.
Balam, the jaguar, eight times king!
Balam, the prince!
NARRATOR. To the Mayans, the gods were demanding gods, fierce and greedy,
granting nothing except for a price, and that price was blood.
ln their profound desire to win favor from the deities,
the Mayans made human sacrifice the keystone of their religion.
To die as a bearer of a message to the gods
was the most exalted honor a man could experience,
for when he was selected to be sacrificed, in that moment, he himself became a god.
He was worshiped as a god, granted any wish that came into his heart,
until the moment he was put to death.
NARRATOR. For centuries, in small, scattered kingdoms,
these people lived in peace with themselves and their gods.
But then came conquerors from the West,
with metal swords, which made them invincible
against the wooden weapons of the Mayans.
One by one, they swallowed up the little kingdoms,
until the last, the final stronghold,
Chichén ltzá was theirs.
And their leader, Hunac Kell, already as cruel as any god,
now felt himself as powerful as one.
I have served your father, and I have loved you as a son.
Now I shall serve you and love you as my king.
Balam ! Nine times king!
Balam, the jaguar, nine times king!
There is still time to let Hunac Kell know that the Mayans are men.
No!
You must flee and preserve your life.
And become a coward before Hunac Kell?
You no longer belong to yourself, Balam.
You belong to your people.
-And how do I serve them? By deserting?
-Dead, you desert your people.
There's a time for fighting and a time to make ready to fight.
He speaks wisely.
Let us lick our wounds, and then make the invader choke on his sword.
There is no place to run.
Hunac Kell and his men will scour the land.
If we are going to die, let us die here.
I’ve said your life is not yours to lose.
You're a king.
Act like a king!
We'll disperse, join forces when we're strong again.
Disperse?
No, that's the one thing we must never do.
My father once told me of an ancient legend, of the time of the great earthquakes when the land shook like the sea, and men took to boats and crossed the waters to the North.
Cross the waters?
We'd slide off the world.
The legend has no truth.
There's no record of it on any stele.
My father told it to me, Priest.
Ah Haleb.
There is a fishing village on the coast not 10 days journey from here.
We will leave from there.
Men do not vanish into air.
There is a hidden passage.
Find it, and find the body of the king and of his son as well.
Until I know that not one drop of that blood remains alive,
I am not King of Chichén ltzá. ls your village near?
This is your king, Balam.
Answer.
It's just beyond that point.
We'll take to the boats and cross the great sea.
But you will all die.
The legend says nothing about boats coming back.
The legend does say that land was found.
Who brought back the word?
But why do your soldiers take our fish?
The catch will be useful to us on the voyage.
-How many boats do you have?
-What you see there.
We will need all of them.
-The king has means of payment?
-No. But it will please the gods.
And be very displeasing to the boat owners.
Seize this man who puts men before gods.
Wait!
You do acknowledge that I am your king?
Kings have always seemed far away.
Small in the distance like wars.
And defeated kings even smaller.
Listen, old man, tell your people to fill every boat with supplies and anything else that will be useful to us in the new land.
-But how will we live after you go?
-Your people are coming with me.
To cross the water to their death?
If crossing the waters frightens you, then you know little of Hunac Kell.
Every soldier that you see here was once a hundred, and their women are now slaves.
To my people, slavery may sound better than the unknown.
I have ordered you and your people to come with me.
Now tell them ! ln spite of your youth, you have the habit of command, but habit is not always enough.
You dare to disobey?
This is Balam, king and son of kings to the ninth generation.
And a stranger here.
My people respect the voice they know.
-Then give them the word.
-If I refuse?
-Ordinarily, I kill only as a duty.
-Leave him !
-Who is this girl?
-My daughter, Ixchel.
Instruct your father, he does not argue with the king.
And has the king the right to order our people to their death?
Until today this was a place of peace.
I will not surrender to Hunac Kell.
We must go to a new land and grow strong and then come back.
Men alone cannot build a new race in a new land.
That is why I need your people, your women and your children.
Now tell them to get into the boats.
You are a new king, Balam, young and brave and untried.
If my people go with you, they will have many doubts and great fears.
You should have someone at your side whom they know and love.
I do not wear my father's crown to share it with you.
Not with me, Balam.
With your queen, my daughter, Ixchel.
When the time comes,
I shall choose my own queen.
To my people, I am as royal as you, so is my daughter.
Priests and soldiers in a womanless land.
Are you destined to be king of a dying race, Balam?
Hunac Kell. Less than a league away.
Hunac Kell is not a league away.
You have not felt his wrath, we have.
He is completely without mercy.
His strength is a sword of metal, and we are powerless against it.
So you have no choice.
If we are all to survive, you must come with me at once.
So I order you, gather your belongings and go to the boats.
-Obey your king!
-They await my word.
-Then give it.
-After you have given me yours.
Will your greed settle for nothing less, old man?
-Nothing less.
-We could take all of his people by force.
And be another Hunac Kell?
Very well.
If I live, I will marry her in the new land.
-The king vows this?
-By the gods, I swear it.
Obey the king!
Why did you do that?
Do you think I have no pride?
When you share his throne, you will have no need to speak of pride.
Hurry! Load as fast as you can!
BALAM: Hurry!
-Leave him ! Leave him !
-Please!
Away!
No! No!
The sea is not big enough to keep us apart, Balam.
Wherever you go, I will find you!
Ixchel, I’ve tried so many times to tell you,
I do grieve with you for the death of your father.
Yet there was a time when you wanted it yourself.
The enemy killed your father, Ixchel, not the king.
And who brought the enemy upon us?
When a man must think of many, it's not easy to think of one.
Oh, God of Waters, the winds forsake us, our men weaken and die.
I plead with you, do not abandon us.
We've lost another boat.
The god of the waters has abandoned us.
Turn back before it's too late.
You know the danger that lies behind.
There cannot be greater danger ahead. lt is not our lives Hunac Kell wants, it's yours, Balam.
Fear presses down upon you, Priest.
Why not use your power? Pray for wind!
Balam, listen to me, as you'd have listened to your father.
I now believe this voyage was doomed from the moment we did not make sacrifice.
There are things that belong to the gods, Balam.
And things that belong to man. ln the name of all that we hold sacred, give the word to turn back or I will.
-Do so and it will be your last.
-I, too, say we should go back.
BALAM: Go back to what?
An honorable death.
Once we both wanted that.
Must we all die for you, Balam?
Women and children, too?
There is new land beneath our feet and a new life lies before us.
Let us then begin with new feelings in our hearts, old fears and old memories to be forgotten.
From this time on, it shall be as though we are reborn.
Before we left the old land, I made a vow, that if we arrived here safely,
I would make Ixchel my queen.
Now, before all of you, I keep my word.
Priest, as the first act in this new land, prepare to perform this marriage as soon as possible.
There will be no need.
You were forced to take that vow.
Nonetheless it is sacred.
And that vow was made to my father.
And to these people who bore witness to it. lt was made to everyone but me.
But no longer need you feel the prisoner of a promise.
My father is dead, and I release you from that vow.
There is much to be done.
We must clear the land, build a temple to our gods and houses for ourselves.
Our task will be hard.
But with faith, we shall endure.
Oh, God, lord of hills and valleys, be patient with us for we are about to destroy your beauty.
Suffer it, we pray you, so that we may dwell here and obtain our daily bread, for in us there is a great hunger.
Send us the many blessings of thy bounty, the life-giving sun, the blessed rain, the fertility of the soil.
We pray you to suffer no animal to attack us, nor enemy to kill us. lt is a sense I have.
Because we saw one canoe does not mean invaders have come.
The canoe is like none we've ever seen.
Where there is one there could be many.
As your chief,
I say strange boats carry strange people.
If the council agrees,
I will search for these strangers.
If I find them, I will bring back one.
Isatai, you will come with me.
One may have to watch, the other must return with word to the council.
We have been looking for these strangers for more than five times this number of days.
-And we'll look more.
-Maybe there are no strangers.
Maybe there was nothing more than a big canoe.
Then we'll find that out.
-There is no need for you to do this.
-My place is with my people.
Now they're Balam's people.
You should be their queen.
Ixchel, your father was wiser than that.
A king is a lonely man, perhaps the loneliest man on earth.
Your father understood that.
He knew that for Balam to rule wisely he needed someone at his side.
Someone he could confide in, trust and love.
Both of you are lonely.
If he is lonely, why doesn't he tell me himself?
How much longer must you keep our farmers piling dirt when they should be planting corn?
Until the temple is completed,
I cannot determine the day the gods will favor our planting.
And there's been no rain.
Perhaps it never rains here.
We will not have to wait for rain.
Come with me.
Ixchel works harder than any.
I told her she belongs with you. lt is no concern of yours, Priest.
My concern is with everyone here, beginning with the king.
Before everyone I offered her marriage and before everyone she made...
Because of a vow.
She's a woman. Go to her again.
-I am a king, I cannot plead.
-She will listen.
To degrade me again?
I have in mind to build a wall of stone here so that the water will be held back.
And then to dig ditches from here to the fields.
And then we'll never have to depend upon rain.
BALAM:
This, I think, would be the place to start. lt may be done, Balam, but first you must sacrifice.
This stream will become the lifeblood of our village.
The God of Waters must be given a life in honest exchange.
All work on the pyramid must, for the moment, stop until we have built this wall of stone and prepared the fields for planting.
That is my command.
Tell your people that Black Eagle has taken your chief, and my warriors will destroy the rest of you.
Let him live.
We have our offering to the God of Waters.
The barbarian has a killing wound but he seems too strong to die.
I have felt that strength.
But how do we know the offering of a barbarian will please the gods?
We are strangers here, he is of this land.
No one could better serve our need.
And we must see to it that he is made well.
Where there's one there must be others, perhaps thousands and every one of them looking for their chief.
Post guards around the village and send out more searchers. lt will be done.
You have done enough for today.
You may go.
Ixchel.
There is...
There is something
I have wanted to tell you.
I have wanted to tell you that I know how hard you work.
All of your people work very hard and I am grateful.
I will tell them.
-He will let no one near him.
-It's like trying to help a wild animal.
Go back to him and heal his wounds.
A life offered to the gods must be a whole one.
He frightens me.
I will try.
Say nothing of the sacrifice.
He will be informed at the appointed time and in the appointed way.
He's like a wild animal because he's being treated like one.
Remember, he tried to kill the king.
And remember that your high priest has chosen him for sacrifice and he should be properly honored.
Rest easy, Balam.
If the barbarians are out there, the searchers will find them.
I only remember how Black Eagle appeared like a spirit, from nowhere.
When I am asleep, my eyes cannot see you.
During the long time of darkness it seemed that I had died.
I hate death.
I remembered the living.
I was angry, it was taken from me.
Then I saw a woman.
I reached out and touched her.
And then I knew I was alive.
But why?
Why am I alive?
Why are you healing me?
Why?
Please sleep now.
Now I will sleep.
Black Eagle was right.
They are people such as we have never seen before.
They live in a big place by the sea.
Their dwellings are made of wood and stone and are fastened to the ground.
They have built a tall mound of earth.
That mound will guide us to where we will avenge our chief.
-How is Black Eagle?
-With me, as violent as ever.
Only Ixchel can touch him.
You look tired, Ixchel.
-Because of you I understand he will live.
-I will.
I will not disappoint you.
And I promise you a much better fight than the last.
You have skill I have not known.
-Where do you come from?
-From across the great sea.
-What do you want on my land?
-To live here.
This land belongs to my people.
There have been many intruders before and we have always driven them away.
But if your warriors have some of your skill, then this will be the greatest battle of all.
Balam, practice with your sword, you will need it.
Balam.
Your woman is beauty.
Why do you call me his woman?
Because he is chief and you are the most beautiful woman here.
You haven't seen many of the others.
I don't have to see.
I know.
You must lie down now.
What do you give me now? lt is from our land. lt will make you well.
Balam is a good fighter but he is a fool.
Why do you say that?
If you are not his woman, then he is a fool.
And it would be good to fight for that, too.
I am a man of faith, Priest, but you must know
I have no love for human sacrifice.
I questioned it in our land and I question it even more here.
Why must this man be put to death, Priest?
A sacrifice to the gods is not a personal matter.
It's a holy act for the good of our people.
Your feelings are of no importance.
As king you will have to do many things you may not like.
When you do them for your people, without hesitation, then you will be truly king.
You will instruct him to put these on.
He will ask why.
As soon as he's properly attired, we will answer.
BLACK EAGLE:
Such a long time you were gone.
-For you.
-For me? Why? lt came with us across the water. lt has great beauty.
Our people can do many things.
Your people.
Can your people jump on a buffalo and ride it?
-What is a buffalo?
-lt is a bull as tall as this house, its horns long as my arms, when it runs the earth shakes.
And our babies lead them around by their noses.
How can your babies reach so high?
You haven't seen our babies.
Why am I being given this?
-To honor you.
-Honor?
A ceremony?
I know.
Your king has decided to let me return to my people. lt is true.
Balam is not only brave, but wise, too.
I will carry back good words.
And when I leave,
I want you to come with me.
No one has ever been as gentle with me as you, Ixchel.
And I have come to love you.
I want you for my wife.
And someday we will watch our babies lead buffalo around by their noses.
Ixchel.
-Speak, Priest.
-Yes.
Tell me of the ceremony.
Our religion teaches that we may send messengers to our gods to offer our prayers, our hopes, to ask for good things for our people.
Black Eagle, you have been chosen to bear our words.
The man thus chosen to look upon our gods is honored before all other men.
He becomes himself a god.
Our people already look on you as more than human.
They offer prayers in your name.
-Prayers?
-You'll be taken to the stone of sacrifice, and thereafter you will live with the gods for all eternity.
You knew.
And Ixchel, she knew, too.
The time for the sacrifice has been set for tomorrow.
Until then you may have anything in our power to give.
A child born to you now would have the qualities of a god. lt would grace our people.
Any of our maidens would be blessed if you summoned her to be your bride.
Ixchel.
Send me Ixchel. lt is time to prepare to unite Black Eagle with Ixchel.
I will not permit it.
Your people trust you, Balam.
Do not betray them.
As your king,
I am required to inform you that...
That Black Eagle has summoned you.
Yes, I know.
You must be very honored.
Deeply honored.
Then go.
He might've said one word.
One single word.
He wished Black Eagle had chosen another.
-She went without question, Priest.
-What could she question?
She might have said that she'd wished she'd not been so...
So honored.
You did not try to stop her?
No.
You are a king, Balam.
The last time you came here you brought me a cape of many feathers.
I held you in my arms and asked you to be my wife.
Now you come here as my bride but not the way I asked.
My bride, until tomorrow, when your priests will come to kill me.
Honor?
Slaughtered.
-Slaughtered for superstition.
-No.
But father a god for you first, then make your crops grow with my blood and be honored. lt is being honored. It's our religion. lt is not the dying, it is the manner of it.
You robbed me of a warrior's death.
You brought me back to life.
You allowed me to believe
I was returning to my people.
You let me love you.
Father a god!
But I don't want a son who is a god.
I only want a son who will be brave as a child leading buffalo around by the nose.
Then why did you ask for me?
I wanted you to feel my hate, as I once wanted you to feel my love.
You sent her away.
I want nothing from any of you.
-The time has come.
-AH ZOK: He refuses to wear this.
Soon you will be a Mayan god. lt is fitting that you dress as one.
If the spirits in your heavens can change me into a god, they can change my clothes as well.
You will carry this petition in the name of our king and of our people.
We ask only peace and the fruits of our labor, the blessings of the sun and the rain and of the richness of the earth.
Blessings of the sun and the rain.
Richness of the earth.
You are fools.
Look around you, Balam.
The grass has always grown for us and the trees spread their branches, the rivers have flowed and my people have always enjoyed these blessings.
My people are the fiercest on earth.
Our land is red with the blood of our enemies.
But never, never have we shed one drop of blood in sacrifice.
And never have we groveled in fear.
And I tell you this, Balam.
Never, so long as I breathe one breath of life, will I ever submit to this.
You will carry our message.
But not to our gods, to your people.
We asked for peace. We still ask for it.
Peace?
That choice will have to lie with my people.
Go to them and carry my words.
I give you your freedom.
Take it.
Balam, I have tried to make you know.
You cannot bring this new life to our people without first giving a life.
For a thousand years we've been bound by this law.
The gods cannot be cheated.
AH HALEB: Barbarians!
Soldiers to your posts.
Women to your houses.
-I have set him free.
-Release him.
When he rejoins his people, their strength will be doubled.
The king has set him free. Open the gates.
There was something in what he said that made me trust him.
Yet the man who was closest to me on earth is dead, and the man who swore to destroy us lives.
For the first time in many days my eyes are happy.
Why did they let you go?
They let me go because their chief wants peace.
They must be cowards! They fear us!
No, they are no cowards.
They fear no one but their gods.
You have chosen me to be your chief, not to command but to guide you.
Now, these are my words.
There have been other intruders in our land, but never people such as these.
They have wisdom that is different from ours.
They have skills, knowledge.
I am thinking we can learn from these people, if we live at their side in peace.
We have never lived at the side of any intruder.
-I speak for war.
-ALL: War! Yes! War!
War! War! War! War! War!
As long as I'm your chief you will listen to my words.
When those words do not reach your hearts, then it is your right to look among you, and choose a new chief.
Go back to your house.
They've chosen war.
Load.
Wait.
Balam.
My people call themselves,
''Wanderers on the Earth,'' but where this large fire burns, it means that Black Eagle is there, and the wanderers have come to rest.
And where did they get the wood for this fire?
Look at our stockade.
We needed firewood and we took it.
We always take what we need.
If we are to live together in peace, there must be no wall between us.
Balam, I will try to make my people understand that they must change some of their ways and learn some of yours.
And we have much to learn from you.
The last time I saw your village,
I was a prisoner.
Now I would like to see it with new eyes.
This is the writing I spoke of.
What is he putting down now?
He is telling how we journeyed across the waters to a new land, and of the new people we have met.
-About me?
-Yes.
Which one is me?
The crops, they grow in this new land.
MAN: The crops, they grow, they grow!
See that they do no damage. lt seems the gods received your message, even though
Black Eagle never delivered it.
The crops grow faster in this new land than they did at home.
And without human blood to nourish them.
Have you forgotten so soon about Ah Min?
That he gave his life for this?
I have not forgotten Ah Min.
But we made this field ready, we planted the seed, and we brought the water.
This crop grew without sacrifice.
How can you make
Ah Min's death seem so worthless?
He loved you.
And I loved him.
And I wish he were here now to see this.
You see how the king denies our religion.
If he is not stopped, he will bring destruction on all of us.
What strange skins.
-Where did they come from?
-We hunted them.
We've never seen such animals.
-Aren't they beautiful?
-If you like them.
If you had hunted these animals yourself, you'd have a higher opinion of them.
I look upon you as one of us, as one of my people.
Remember all those times in my hut when we were alone,
I asked you to be my woman and bear my sons.
But you didn't answer me.
Your lips are not sealed anymore, Ixchel.
Say now you will be my bride.
Go to him ! Be his woman! Bear his sons!
Before when he summoned you, you went to him willingly.
And now I know it was not for the first time.
Balam, wait.
Balam !
No!
Our people cannot live together.
There is a wall between us.
Being rooted like trees never was meant for us.
I take my people to where we belong, where there is no roof but the sky, where there are no walls to the edges of the earth.
I take them to where birds sing for us, and where we live free like the deer.
I would go with you.
I'd never leave your side except...
Balam.
I'm proud that you would fight for me and grateful.
But I know what I felt when I thought he was going to die.
After his words to you he should have died.
But his words were the first words he ever used to tell me that he loved me.
AH HALEB: Hunac Kell.
Balam's old enemy with metal swords has found him.
They will destroy Balam.
-Sound the battle drums.
-ISATAI: I thought you wanted him dead.
Until now, so did I.
Our king defies the gods and we are powerless against him.
He is at the root of all our troubles.
But if Balam were dead, you could lead us, and we could still make our peace with Hunac Kell.
Balam, if you surrender,
I will spare your people!
Your life, Balam, for the lives of your people!
If you do not surrender, every man, woman and child will perish!
BALAM: Pitz!
PITZ: Archers, make way.
Stand!
Balam !
Not even you can heal this.
Speak to your people, Balam.
BALAM: Hunac Kell is dead.
The way to our homeland lies open.
But now, I look upon what we have here.
The grass grows, the trees spread their branches, and the rivers flow.
And we have not spilled one drop of blood in sacrifice to the gods.
Can it not be that the gods are satisfied with the sacrifices that each of us must make in his day-to-day life, that the test of a people is in the living, not the dying, and living in dignity and decency and respect is all that the gods require?
As for me, I remain here, but in Black Eagle's way,
I give you your choice.
You may stay or you may go.
But if you choose to stay, it will be without this.
ALL: Balam, the jaguar, nine times king!
You never taught me to write, and I never taught you to hunt.
And yet there are many things we have learned from each other.
Don't be a fool the rest of your life, Balam.
Ixchel is your woman.
She has always been.
And now, more so than ever.
This land has a name today
and is marked on maps.
But the names and the marks and the land
all had to be won.
Won from nature and from primitive man.
Five generations ago,
a mere 125 years back...
... this land was known
only as the West.
Known only to a handful of white men...
... lonely trappers wandering its vastness
in search of beaver.
They were known as mountain men,
a new breed.
Men like Jim Bridger,
Franchère and Sublette, Linus Rawlings.
More Indian than the Indians
in all but blood.
They held to no law but their own...
... drifted free as the clouds,
settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.
Their mocassined feet and unshod horses
leaving no trace on the land.
Like the Indians,
with whom they were at peace...
... they wanted nothing beyond
what they found, and little of that.
The mountains, the forests,
the harsh country...
... were as unchanging to them
as the stars...
... and just as unyielding.
Far behind the mountains,
beyond the rolling plains...
... they had left the people of the East,
people who were restless in another way.
The kind who'd look at a mountain
and see a watershed...
... look at a forest
and see lumber for houses...
... look at a stony field and see a farm.
Their faces and their instincts
had been turned to the West...
... ever since Plymouth Rock
and Jamestown.
The trapper's road was the trail
of a wolf or the bend of a canyon.
But for whole families
chaffing to follow the sun...
... there had to be broader ways.
There were no roads into the wilderness,
only rivers.
And they flowed in the wrong direction:
North or south.
Or else they stopped at the Alleghenies.
Until one day, a new river took source
in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.
He conceived of a river
that would go west.
And in the way Americans have
of acting out their dreams, it came to be.
The Erie Canal left the Hudson
above Albany...
... and carried clear across
to the Great Lakes.
People who yearned for virgin land
and a new life...
... now had a highway to take them.
And they moved along.
Pride of Utica now loading!
All aboard for the Pride of Utica!
The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...
...the Skoga family!
All eight of them!
All aboard for the Pride of Utica!
Is the laddie's health the reason you're heading west?
Partly.
Only partly.
Mostly our trouble East was rocks.
I had me a farm where some years
I'd raise 100 bushels of rocks to the acre.
Zebulon, you hadn't ought to lie to the man like that.
Wife, I'm a God-fearing soul, and I tell the truth as I see it.
Now, I never used a plow.
I'd blast out the furrows with gunpowder.
And then one morning,
I hauled the bucket up out of the well...
...and so help me, the bucket was full of rocks.
Rocks.
I just stood there right still trying not to blaspheme.
I said to myself,
"You've got a son that's ailing...
...you've got a daughter what won't take to herself a husband."
- There she sits there, mooning as usual.
- Pa.
You've got another who don't seem quite right in the head.
Lilith?
Yes, Pa?
Now, I'll remind you, sir.
I'm still standing there holding a bucket full of rocks...
...and staring into a bleak old age.
So I made me a vow right then and there. I said:
"If I can find a man with $500 who likes rocks...
...then there's gonna be another fool owning this farm."
Well, sir, the Lord provided such a man...
...and here I am.
He ain't told you one word of truth,
Mr. Harvey.
We had the best farm in the township.
Yeah, Rockville Township it was.
Stone County.
Oh, it was not.
It was his itching foot that brought us here.
Heaven knows where we'll end up.
Oh, these are my laddies.
Angus, Brutus and Colin.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
I think they're already acquainted with your daughters.
- Be they single?
- Aye, single so far.
Well, this Illinois country's beginning to sound better to me.
Lilith?
Lilith, here. Strike up a little tune for these handsome lads.
- Oh, I ain't in no mood, Pa.
- Lilith, there's a time for coaxing...
...this ain't the time.
All right.
All right.
A captain bold in Halifax
Who lived in country quarters
Betrayed a maid who hanged herself
One morning in her garters...
Lilith.
Now, you know better than to sing a song like that.
- What ones do you know?
- We know "Yankee Doodle."
- "Yankee Doodle"?
- Their mother's dead.
They haven't had much learning in the social graces.
All right, give them
"A Home in the Meadow."
Eve, come on, you too.
That's it.
Come on, join in.
That's it.
Come on.
Stop.
Loading for the Flying Arrow!
All aboard for the Flying Arrow!
- The Prescott family!
- Here we be. Come on.
Alec Harvey and three sons!
Jeffrey Rose and family!
But the canal was only the first step
toward the promised land.
The next steps were longer and harder.
Those who could raise the fare
went by steamboat to the end of the line.
Others found a cheaper way
to head for Ohio, Illinois...
... and the open spaces beyond.
Lilith. Lilith, listen to this:
"Theirs was a poignant parting in the forest.
The handsome young backwoodsman carved two hearts on a tree trunk...
...then from ten paces, hurled a knife at the junction of the two hearts."
Junction. What's that?
Well, that's where the two hearts meet.
Now, listen:
"His marksmanship was uncanny.
Three times he hurled the knife on target.
'That was for luck,, he said the first time.
'That was for love. Deep, divine love" he said the second.
And the third time, 'That was a prayer, a plea for love undying."'
Isn't that beautiful?
I reckon. If anybody ever talks like that.
Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.
There ain't no sense to you, Eve.
You wanna to be a farm wife, but you don't wanna marry a farmer.
Neither do you.
Of course not.
I don't wanna have nothing to do with farms.
I want silk dresses and fine carriages and a man to smell good.
What I want's back East, not West.
But I'll get there yet. You watch.
You don't know what you want yet.
It's the man that counts, not where he lives.
- Ready, now?
Ready.
Daddy, Daddy, something coming upriver.
Hostile Indians, I suspect.
- Could it be river pirates, Zebulon?
- Don't know.
They say no honest man travels this river at night.
I can only see one man, Pa.
I hear that's a favorite pirate trick.
They hide in the bottom of the boat...
...till they're ready to jump you.
- Get my gun, Colin.
- All right, Pa.
Just come in slow and easy, stranger.
And keep your hands where we can see them.
Name's Linus Rawlings.
I'm hungrier than sin and real peaceful like.
- What have you got in the craft?
- Beaver pelts.
I said beaver pelts.
I never had a chance to see a beaver pelt,
Mr. Rawlings.
Well, in that case, ma'am,
I'll show you one.
There you are.
That's real soft.
It's a fine pelt, ma'am.
Now, my apologies, sir.
- We was afeared you might be a pirate.
- I ain't no pirate.
Come on, let's have supper and get acquainted.
No, no, no. That's yours.
Keep that, ma'am.
Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.
Is he the backwoodsman you've been waiting for?
More than likely he's got a wife and six kids waiting for him.
Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.
You've only had four plates.
I was beginning to think you didn't like it.
Well, it don't pay to eat too much on an empty stomach, ma'am.
How come you're to be traveling so late at night?
Well, I'm kind of anxious to get to Pittsburgh.
I ain't seen a city for a long time.
I aim to whoop it up a little.
Well, now, we've never seen a mountain man before.
Tell me, them Rocky Mountains as high as they say?
Well, now, I just don't rightly know.
I never climbed one. I've...
Uh...
Well, you know, that just ain't exactly true.
Jim Bridger and me...
...we started up one of them little-bitty
Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.
And then, one day, we see this fella...
...and he has a great big pair of white wings...
...and a harp in his hand.
And I said to Jim...
...I said, "Jim, I don't like the way that fella's looking at us."
And Jim said he didn't care too much for it neither...
...so we both skedaddled down out of there...
...and to this day I ain't never had a good look at the Rocky Mountains.
- Well, I remember one time...
- Zebulon.
- What?
- One liar at a time is enough.
Well, then, I reckon it's about bedtime.
Gotta get an early start in the morning.
We'll be expecting you for breakfast.
Oh, well, that's mighty hospitable,
Mr. Prescott...
...but sometimes I wake up and get the urge to move.
I might be long gone by sunup, but thank you.
- I wanna thank all of you. Good night.
- Good night.
- Strange fellas, these mountain men.
- Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.
- By golly, that looks like my blanket.
- It is.
Well, then, I'm a mite confused, ma'am.
Whose bed would it be?
Yours.
I ain't ever saw a bed like that since last time I come east.
Why'd you do it?
Ain't polite to ask a girl why she done something for a man.
No. Well, I reckon my manners ain't much at that.
Anyway, I sure thank you.
Good night, ma'am.
Are them Indian girls pretty?
Well, now, I reckon that all depends on just how long a man has gone...
...without seeing one.
How long's it been since you seen a white girl?
I ain't quite sure why you asked that.
How pretty do I look to you?
But, ma'am...
...ain't you just being a little bit forward?
Well, you're headed upriver and I'm headed down.
There's no time to get these questions answered.
You dead sure you want them answered?
Yes.
Glory be.
Ma'am, it seems like you've been kissed before.
I've never been kissed permanent before.
By golly, you sure use surprising words.
I never heard "permanent" mixed up with a thing like a kiss before.
I can still feel that kiss.
- Can you?
- Well, you said something before...
...that we had not forget:
I'm heading upstream and you're headed downstream.
Lovers have parted before and come together again.
- Ma'am.
- Eve.
Eve, I'm a sinful man.
Deep, dark, sinful.
I'm on my way to Pittsburgh to be sinful again.
Likely I'll stay drunk for a month.
I won't even remember the fancy gals I dally with...
...or the men I carve up just out of pure cussedness...
...any more than I'll remember you.
Linus, I'm asking you.
Can you still feel that kiss?
Eve...
Eve, you make me feel like a man standing on a narrow ledge...
...coming face-to-face with a grizzly bear.
There just ain't no ignoring the situation.
Eve!
Eve!
- Eve! Where is she?
- Zeb, what's the matter?
Anyways, you're here.
I thought you'd gone with him.
- Gone?
- Yes, gone.
I knowed you were setting with him...
...but I kept telling myself,
"At least she's looking at a man."
Even a wisp of smoke like that is better than...
Are you crying? Crying for him?
Now, what does that mean?
Now, tell me what that means.
Nothing, Pa.
What time did you come to bed?
It was early, Pa.
It wasn't. It was late.
Daughter, I'm only gonna ask you once.
Is there anything for your ma and pa to worry about?
No, Pa, there ain't.
He'll be back.
I'll see him again.
But you expected to see him this morning.
You know you did.
I don't care. I'll see him again.
Look.
- You got a growed man to do that?
- I did. Just like in the book.
Did you get him to say them crazy words?
I told you before, it ain't the words, it's the sentiment.
You mean, he didn't even giggle nor nothing at such foolishness?
He said it was a real solemn occasion.
Like shooting the rapids without a paddle.
No matter what he said, he did it just to get rid of you so as he could clear out.
You know that's so.
And you're lucky he did. Do you wanna live like a squaw all your life?
Go on, say anything you like...
...but I'll see him again. I know I will.
And he ain't got a wife and six kids.
He ain't got a wife at all yet.
Hey, Pierre!
Someone's coming upriver.
Customer.
Trapper, seems like.
See how that cover bellies up?
Could be furs.
Thirsty, mister?
Drier than a grasshopper on a hot griddle.
Well, welcome to our little inn, sir.
My name is Jeb Hawkins, late colonel of the Alabama militia.
- Where you bound for?
- Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh? Well.
Looks like he's got a whole canoe of furs, Pop.
- Sure enough mountain man.
- Indeed.
One of our explorers gonna extend our domain to the far shores of the Pacific.
Well, nothing but the finest for you, sir.
Whiskey?
- Right.
- No pepper or rattlesnake heads in this.
Nothing but the pure grain and the sweet kiss of the malt.
- Never mind the cup, I'll just take the jug.
- Oh, a real mountain man, huh?
- I trust you'll toast our noble banner, sir.
- Sure will.
Golly, you're right.
That's real sipping liquor.
Pa, him being a trapper, you suppose he might know what that varmint is we got?
Well, say, now, he might.
Yes, sir, he just might.
Sir, we caught us a cave-dwelling critter...
...that no man in these parts has seen before.
You know, it'd be right satisfying to having you tell us what it is.
Well, I don't know too much about cave-dwelling varmints.
Just yonder. Take your jug.
Well, I...
I don't know.
WOIt's right over here.
You know any sweet-talking gals in Pittsburgh?
No, no. Nary a one, yet.
Well, Pop and I are hoping we'll vacation there.
I'll be at the Duquesne House if it ain't burned down.
Hey, there, now, you pretty girl, you sure you got a varmint in here?
Now, you...
WODo you hear him?
Huh?
WOHe breathes loud and fierce.
- We keep him in this hole just yonder.
You keep him in there?
You gotta look a little closer.
Well, he seen the varmint, Pa.
- Well done, daughter.
- I ain't so sure.
He was hard muscled. I could feel the blade just skitter along his ribs.
Oh, you just need more practice, that's all.
It's a pity you ain't got the knack your ma had.
Lord rest her soul.
All right, men, lay it on, men.
Come on, come on.
We got more fish to fry.
Down to the island.
Tell Pa them settlers, rafts are coming.
Can't I have this toilet water, Pa?
- Genuine Parisian accent, it says.
- How much is it?
It's only 15 cents.
Fifteen cents? Put it back.
You're right, sir. Absolutely right.
You save the pennies and dollars will grow.
Likely you've growed many a dollar.
Mr. Bedloe, all my life I've been striving to avoid becoming a millionaire.
I think I've succeeded right well.
I've got a little put away in the sock.
It'll stay there.
Well, now, them's my sentiments exactly.
Now, you, sir.
You look like a man of property.
Now, if I was to bet, I'd say you was worth, say, a thousand dollars.
- Pretty close to the mark?
- Well, close, maybe.
Colin, how much powder we got left?
- Don't be afraid, now, don't be afraid.
Now, there's women and children here.
You gents wouldn't want us to have to start shooting, now, would you?
Be of good cheer, folks.
It's in our noble tradition that we conquer the wilderness...
...with nothing but our bare hands and stout hearts.
You can build new rafts and sally forth in the spirit of your forefathers.
Why, you pious old scoundrel.
I'll see you burn.
Americans can't be whipped.
It's him.
I knew he'd come back. It's him.
Now let us pray.
O Lord...
...we thank thee for our salvation.
We commit the souls of our dead to thy gentle keeping.
We pray for a speedy recovery of our wounded.
And now another matter.
O Lord...
...without consulting with thee...
...we have sent thy way some souls whose evil ways passeth all understanding.
We ask thee humbly to receive them.
Whether you want them or not.
Amen.
Now, it'll be a job...
...but I guess I can patch her up good enough to get to Pittsburgh.
- Linus.
- Now, Eve...
...let's just not talk any more about it.
Linus, I'm telling you, you don't know your own mind.
Well, maybe so, maybe not.
You know, I ain't saying that you haven't been on my mind some.
I ain't saying that.
But I still went to see the varmint with that pirate girl.
I'll always be going to see the varmint, Eve.
I just ain't cut out to be a farmer or a husband.
Linus, I ain't never bringing up the subject again...
...whether ever I see you or not.
No, it's for the best.
I wish you Godspeed, Eve.
And I ain't said that to anybody for a long time.
I can see rapids ahead, Pa. White water.
Look. Look.
Oh, we must've taken the wrong fork.
Let's beach her on this side.
Harvey!
Rapids!
Rapids ahead! Beach her!
Beach her!
Hold her steady.
Rein!
Pa, we're in the current!
Get inside, Zeke.
No, I don't wanna.
Straighten her, Pa.
Lilith!
Hold it steady!
I can't!
Go on. Go on to help Pa.
I'll get it.
Lilith! Lilith!
Lie down!
Lie down!
What happened?
They took the wrong fork of the river and they went over the falls.
Did you happen to hear the name of the family?
Uh... Prescott, I think.
Something like that.
As soon as they're buried decent...
...I'm heading back East on the first boat that comes along.
And if you were in your right mind, you would too.
Oh, Linus.
Would you walk with me a piece, Eve?
Eve, I...
Eve, all the time I was paddling down here
I was thinking...
...if I found you alive, I'd...
Would you come to Pittsburgh with me, Eve?
Oh, Linus.
I'm staying right here.
I ain't moving a foot one way or the other.
Now, would you explain that a little?
Ma and Pa, they wanted a farm in the West...
...and this is as far as they got.
Seems to me this is where the Lord wanted the farm to be.
But your brother, Sam, he's bad hurt, and winter's coming...
There's no sense talking about it.
I'm gonna do it.
Eve, you just ain't making much sense.
Well, half the people that come West don't make much sense, I reckon.
All right.
All right.
By golly, you're a strong-minded woman.
I reckon I seen that varmint for the last time.
The westward course was no smoother
than that of true love.
Not only the hard hand of nature
was against it, but the impediment of war.
Trouble over land
smoldered along the Mexican border.
Not all Americans were for war, including
Congressman Abe Lincoln of Illinois.
But a war did break out,
and in the end...
... vast new territories came into the Union
along with their rich Spanish names:
Rio Grande, Santa Fe,
Albuquerque, El Paso.
And most glittering of all, California...
... named after a mythical island
of pearls and gold in a 15th-century novel.
Here, in 1848...
... at Sutter's Mill, a man found something
he wasn't even looking for...
... at the bottom of a ditch.
And the cry of his discovery was heard
clear across the continent...
... in Boston, New York, Savannah...
... and across the oceans
in London, Paris, Berlin.
But nowhere was the clamor of gold
heard more eagerly than in St. Louis...
... the busiest fur-trading center
in the world...
... and the noisiest, bawdiest,
most uppity town west of New York.
I say there's no more than three.
- Six.
- Six?
It's that lace that fooled you. I say three.
Watch him. I hear Cleve's an expert on petticoats. Anyway, you can never prove it.
We're going to be late for that poker game.
Look, I've just stuck you for the most expensive dinner in St. Louis.
I don't mind sticking you a bit deeper.
I'll lay you a hundred it's no less than six.
- How will you prove it?
- Go backstage and find out.
- If I go back and check with you.
- Fair enough.
Second girl.
- Miss Prescott? Miss Prescott?
- Later.
It's rather important.
It's always important.
The older they are, the more important it gets.
Miss Prescott, please.
I am Hylan Seabury...
...attorney in the matter of Jonathan Brooks.
He means nothing to you?
That old goat?
Well, you must've meant something to him, Miss Prescott.
- Why?
- You're included in his will.
Of course, you have to make the trip to California to claim the bequest.
Well, now, I wouldn't go to California...
...if John Jacob Astor left me
San Francisco.
I don't think Mr. Astor had holdings there, no.
However, the yield from
Mr. Brooks, property is not to be scorned.
- Yield of what?
- Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.
- Gold?
- Precisely.
You own a gold mine, Miss Prescott.
It yielded $3500 the very first week.
Gold mine?
Well. Well, I...
That sweet old goat.
For heavens...
Well.
This is an unexpected pleasure.
- Where's the money?
- Money?
Money?
Oh, yes. You're referring, of course, to our little agreement.
One hundred to start you off...
...and my share of the winnings.
Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to report that the hundred no longer exists.
That $100, I assure you...
...will turn out to be the best investment you have ever made.
I have plans, gentlemen...
...beyond your wildest dreams.
I'm gonna earn you a piece of a gold mine.
Gold mine.
You ain't gonna earn nothing.
You ain't gonna be nothing, you ain't gonna do nothing...
...unless we get that 100 back by the morning.
Grimes, you don't mean that.
- You're gonna kill off the golden goose.
- Call it what you want, mister.
We'll be waiting.
Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off
point for emigrants from everywhere.
Solid, God-fearing families
bound for the farmlands of Oregon...
... and get-rich-quick adventurers
racing for the gold of California.
Try it.
- You got a wagon, I suppose?
- I can get one.
And a team to pull it?
I can get everything I need.
- You got a husband?
- I'm single, Mr. Morgan.
No traveling companion?
- No, I'm traveling alone.
- Not on my wagon train.
Alone and single brings out the deviltry in a man.
Gets them all worked up and they're wild enough already.
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.
Oh, woman of your sort?
One day you'd find yourself in trouble, and there'd be hell to pay just figuring out who.
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?
Well, now, ain't you the feisty one.
I like spirit in a woman.
Hey, you got a pretty face under that powder too.
And a fine, sturdy body under them clothes, I wager.
There's a woman named Clegg,
Aggie Clegg.
Why don't you go see her?
Thanks.
I told you, no.
I was hoping to make this trip with a husband.
Nearly got one last week.
Look, I hear there's 40 men to every woman in California.
- Miss Clegg, I'd be willing to pay you.
- I don't need money.
I need a man.
Any man.
Morning, ladies.
Beautiful morning.
Would you, by any chance, happen to be Miss Lily Prescott?
Not unless you got a big imagination.
Then you must be the lady in question.
Cleve Van Valen, Miss Prescott, at your service.
At your every command from here to California.
Well, thank you.
But whatever you're offering,
I don't need.
Perhaps you don't understand.
Yes, I do.
I know a tinhorn when I see one.
Miss Prescott.
I'm offering you an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.
Goodbye, Mr. Van Valen. Goodbye.
Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you,
Miss Clegg.
May I say I have never seen a woman with more beautiful hair.
What a prize catch it'll make...
...hanging from the waist of an Indian.
Beauty alone in the wilderness, and who's to protect you?
No one.
Not one person won't be looking after himself.
Well...
Good day, ladies. Good day.
Nobody ever said that to me before.
What?
That I had such... Such beautiful hair.
You know something?
I got a hunch you're gonna draw men like fish to the bait.
Maybe I can catch one of them while they swim by.
You got yourself a partner.
Thank you.
How's it, men?
It's all clear through here. Look for a little mudhole up through the next pocket.
How far?
Oh, maybe half a quarter.
Well, thanks.
Looks a little higher up on that ridge.
There's a water hole up there about half a mile. Let's head for it.
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.
Hey, you're driving.
I was raised on a farm.
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.
Hey, Aggie?
- Can you use these?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Ladies.
At your service.
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.
Well, I just couldn't bear to think of you two making this trip without my help.
If I was to hear later on that something happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.
You came 100 miles alone?
Well, I had no way of counting the miles,
Mr. Morgan, but I'll take your word for it.
Well, you've got another 100, mister.
Going back.
I told you, when a wagon breaks down,
I want men who can fix it...
...not bet how long it'll take.
You don't mean you'll turn me out?
Pass me adrift at the mercy of savage Indians?
If you don't get moving,
I'll cast you adrift...
Uh-uh-uh.
I appeal to your sporting instinct, sir.
I'm prepared to wager you that I stay with this train.
- Well, you got a wager.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
The fact is, I hired this man.
We'll put up his stake.
Is that right, Miss Prescott?
If Miss Clegg says so.
Ma'am...
...I'll be forever grateful.
Now, I'll unpack my gear.
Agatha, have you gone crazy?
He says he's a man wanting to do an honest day's work.
And he'll do it. I can promise you that.
Hey, you men on that last wagon, keep up that slack.
Keep it up.
Get that team moving.
Keep them moving there.
Don't let those lines sag.
Keep them up. Keep them up.
Keep those teams moving.
Keep them moving.
Don't let those lines sag.
You, on that middle team, keep them moving.
Get in there.
Over here, Pa.
Get in there.
Get in there. Get in there, mule.
I'm just overwhelmed by all this attention,
Miss Prescott.
I want to confess...
...I have lied about why I wanted to work for you.
I know.
The real reason is, of course, that I'm in love with you.
No.
It's the truth.
From the first moment I saw you,
I've known that I couldn't live without you.
Well, I'd hate to be the cause of your death, Mr. Van Valen.
I don't speak lightly, Miss Prescott.
I'm prepared to assume the responsibilities of a faithful husband.
Oh, and are you ready to assume the responsibilities...
...of my property too, Mr. Van Valen?
Really?
What kind of property?
Gold, Mr. Van Valen.
Gold by the ton, from what I understand.
Bright, yellow, shiny gold.
Why, I had no idea.
- I'm sure you hadn't.
- Miss Prescott, I really mean...
Here comes Agatha.
If you must propose to somebody...
...I suggest you get on your knees to her.
Besides, she has beautiful hair.
Look at them.
Think they was getting ready to bury somebody.
Ain't we worn down enough as it is?
Well, let's wake them up.
Listen, everybody.
That's the spirit! That's the way to feel!
Oh, hiya, Mr. Morgan!
Aggie. For lunch.
Thanks. Nice nest of fish.
What is it, Mr. Morgan?
Miss Prescott, I've been thinking.
Oh?
Wet or dry, you're the handsomest woman
I ever did see.
Spirit and a fine, sturdy body.
It's a noble combination, Miss Prescott.
Why, for you, childbearing would come as easy as rolling off a log.
Well, I think I'd rather roll off a log,
Mr. Morgan.
Ma'am, I'm telling you, you got the build for it.
I want you for my wife.
I've got a cattle ranch just below the Merced.
I'll be settling down there, fit and proper.
I'm sure you're very fit and proper,
Mr. Morgan.
Well, then...
...you just couldn't do no better than marrying me.
Why, we'd have ourselves a fine family in no time at all.
I believe that.
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan...
...but I can't accept your proposal.
Why not?
Well, a woman likes to hear something a little more inviting.
Well, ain't that what I've been doing?
Inviting you?
Inviting you to share my life,
Miss Prescott.
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.
It's something else, ain't it?
Must be something else nagging at you.
Well...
...I don't aim to let it stop me,
Miss Prescott.
You can count on that.
What did he want?
Children.
Children?
Well, I'll be...
Why didn't he come shopping at the right store?
- I'll take a look.
- Well.
Now, gentlemen, are we pikers?
I'm gonna see and I'm gonna raise this fine pistol...
...London-made and loaded for bear.
I'll take part of that bet.
I told you I wouldn't stand for you fleecing any...
Cheyennes.
There's too many to fight.
We'll have to run for it.
You can't outrun them with wagons.
The minute you get moving, cut your teams loose.
- Have you gone crazy?
- Go on, get moving.
Chances are they want our stock more than us.
Now, you're a gambler, ain't you?
All right, let's get moving.
Keep them closed up there.
I don't know how to unhook them.
Cleve, watch out!
Cleve!
Joe, pick me up.
We'll be moving at daybreak.
I'll take a few men, see if we can find him.
Give him a decent, Christian burial.
Someone's coming! Someone's coming!
Well, I can let you have this rig for a dollar a day, and I'll give you a good team.
- Pick it up in the morning.
- That'll be fine.
Could you tell me the way to the Brooks claim?
Well, the claims are down by the river.
- Which road should I take?
- Only one road. Along the river.
- Thank you.
- Sure welcome.
We're looking for a Mr. Huggins.
You found him.
This is Miss Lilith Prescott.
I figured.
They told me you was a real looker.
Yup. It's all here for you.
Just the way Mr. Brooks staked it out.
Must've had 20 men working on it.
Well, where are they now?
Who's digging the gold?
Gold? I ain't never seen a better grade since I come here with Millie.
It was just a pocket, though.
The whole shebang, nothing but a pocket.
Oh, we cleared 4200 before it played out.
Now, about that 4200...
Mr. Brooks, he spent three before his heart give out.
I put up 600 for a brass-handled casket.
I figure the rest you owe me for sitting on your claim.
Oh, miss, I mean, that's only fair, ain't it?
I mean, wouldn't you...?
Funny pair, all right.
How about you boys?
Come and see the brand-new attraction.
It's exciting and sensational.
Step right in, gentlemen.
Miss Prescott?
Hello, Mr. Morgan.
I'd invite you in, but it's a little cramped.
This is no life for a fine woman like you.
I heard your mine was played out.
But where's your fancy friend?
Cleve?
Last I heard, he was in Hangtown.
You mean that no-good went off and left you?
He went off and left me.
But I don't agree that he's no good.
Cleve is Cleve, that's all.
You're a perplexing woman,
Miss Prescott.
When a skunk needs killing...
...well, it ain't enough just to say a skunk's a skunk.
Mr. Morgan...
...all my life I've wanted to marry a rich husband.
Can I blame Cleve for wanting to marry a rich wife?
Both of us may have been born for the poorhouse...
...but we're not the kind to like it.
Do you believe all this you've been saying, or is it just words?
Now, tell me the truth.
The truth is...
...Cleve and I couldn't live alone just on love.
Not for five minutes.
Then you've answered the question I've been asking for better than 2000 miles.
I got the biggest ranch you ever did see.
You can't ride across it in a day.
That land's gonna mean money sooner than you think.
You want a rich husband...
...you're looking at him.
There ain't a blessed thing you have to do except mind the kids.
I'm sorry.
Not now.
Not ever.
What a waste.
Someone put together like you.
Aggie.
Those who struck it rich wanted
all the pleasures that money could buy.
And there were plenty to sell to them.
Even the Sacramento riverboats
took on luxury goods.
I'll see it.
It's up to you.
Betting?
What's the matter with you?
- I'm checking out.
- Checking out?
What's the matter with him?
Lily, I got to talk to you.
I found myself throwing in a winning hand.
Well, I just never thought
I'd do that for any girl.
Lily.
How'd you like to hook up with a no-good gambler?
Oh, hon, we are on our way.
I got $1200 right here.
- What'll we do, open a gambling house?
- No.
A married man should spend his evenings at home.
Then we'll open a music hall in San Francisco.
- No.
- I can still sing and dance.
No. A married woman should spend her evenings at home.
- But we can't sit at home on $1200 for...
- Lily.
Have you seen San Francisco?
It's ugly, and it's small, and it's full of fleas.
And it burns down about every five minutes...
...but each time they keep on rebuilding it a little bigger and better than before.
It's alive and kicking and nothing can stop it.
And it makes you wanna build something too.
A railroad.
A steamship line.
Something to help the baby grow.
Cleve, on $1200?
We could start out with a wagon or a rowboat.
With the help of the devil,
I'll bet we make it.
Young America was not only
a union of East and West.
There were North and South too.
And between them,
the bonds were weakening.
Mr. Lincoln, now retired
from Congress and practicing law...
... realized that the South would fight...
... to mold the new and
uncommitted territories to its own image.
Still two years from the presidency...
... he pleaded that the free West
be allowed to remain free...
... and warned of the hazards
of a house divided against itself.
But the South,
seeing its power and influence wane...
... struggled against the inevitable
in dozens of Western towns.
And slowly, the bitter seeds of civil war
took root.
Howdy, Ms. Rawlings.
Whoa, Rosebud, whoa.
Say, Mr. Peterson, what's that suit you got on?
Uniform, Mrs. Rawlings. A uniform.
Our militia company was sworn in...
...and I'm Corporal Peterson now,
Ohio Volunteers.
You won't be seeing me for a spell.
Hey, I got a letter for you, from way out in California.
It must be from my sister, Lilith.
"Dear Eve..."
Mr. Peterson, could you wait a minute?
I wanna answer this right away.
Zeb?
Zeb, come on down here.
Well, we was hoping that Zeb might be going with us.
His pa went when the first bugle blew.
Ain't one enough?
Hi, corporal.
Jeremiah, get Mr. Peterson some buttermilk.
Buttermilk.
It's from your aunt Lilith.
She says there ain't no war out in California and they don't expect there'll be one.
"Business is brisk.
Many opportunities for an energetic young man."
There's talk of building a railroad east.
"Cleve has hopes of getting in on the ground floor.
We would welcome Zeb if he wants to come."
Ma, did you write her about me?
- Not exactly.
- Now, did you?
I told her you didn't like farming any better than your pa did.
Ma, you got the wrong idea about this war.
It ain't gonna be so bad, is it, corporal?
You know Pa's having the time of his life.
Now, Ms. Rawlings,
I got it from the captain himself...
...that we ain't gonna be gone no time at all.
Pa left it up to you whether I go or not.
But you know what he really felt.
Ms. Rawlings, there ain't much glory in tromping behind a plow.
Reckon there's no hurry in answering this letter.
Thank you for waiting.
You mean I can go?
Oh, there'll be things to do.
Ma...
Gotta get your underwear washed and your socks darned.
Do they give you one of them suits?
One of them uniforms?
I reckon.
Might not give you no shirts, though.
Take that one off, I'll wash it for you.
I got the others washed, they aren't ironed yet.
Mother, I...
Why'd you call me that?
It's always been "Ma" before.
I don't know.
All of a sudden...
..."Ma" didn't seem enough somehow.
Hey, cowpoke!
Go on back, dog!
Go on!
What could I do, Pa?
He's Linus, boy.
Always was more Linus, blood.
I guess that's why I love him so much.
But you've gotta help me pray, Pa.
Help me pray.
Ohio.
Battery B, Ohio!
- Let's go!
On the double, come on!
Anybody here from the 12th Michigan?
Thirty-sixth Indiana.
Evening of April 6th, 1862.
The guns that had roared all day
fell silent...
... around a little church
called the Shiloh Meeting House.
Many a man had met his God
that Sunday...
... but not in church.
You wasted your time, men. He's dead.
- But, doc, this here is Captain Rawlings.
- Captain Linus Rawlings.
- Take him out.
- Keep moving, men.
- Why can't you look where you're going?
- I'm sorry, soldier.
Watch it.
Saw. Brandy.
Chloroform.
Get it all down. Come on, all of it.
Come on, we're just in the way here.
It had been the bloodiest day
of the war on the Western front.
In the morning, it had looked like
a Confederate victory, but by nightfall...
... no man cared to use
the words "win" or "lose."
After Shiloh...
... the South never smiled.
- You tasted that water yet?
- No.
Well, try it.
- Tastes funny, huh?
- Yeah.
I seen it before sundown. It was pink.
Pinker than sassafras tea.
You mean...?
It don't seem fitting a man should have to drink water like that.
Don't seem fitting a man should have to do any of the things we've done today.
Did you kill anybody?
I don't think so.
I got knocked dizzy right off.
And when I come to, found my rifle, it was busted.
And then some more soldiers come along and tried to stick me in the arm.
All the rest is mixed up after that.
Well, I ain't killed nobody, neither.
And I don't want to.
- Hey, where you from?
- Ohio.
This fool war started in the East.
What's us Westerners doing in it?
I don't rightly know anymore.
It ain't quite what I expected.
There ain't much glory looking at a man with his guts hanging out.
- Where are you from?
- Texas.
Say...
You ain't a Reb, are you?
Well, I was this morning.
Tonight, I ain't so sure.
Seems like I ought to be shooting you.
Well, you got anything to shoot with?
No.
All I got's this bayonet.
I got a pistol.
I took it off a dead officer.
Hey, why don't we skedaddle out of here?
- You mean desert?
- I mean, why don't...?
Just leave this here war to the folks who'd want it.
They say there ain't no war out in California.
Get that battery over here.
Stragglers, join your regiment.
Stragglers. Hey, you!
I'm planning to move Rousseau's brigade into this area.
Hidden battery, placed well before dawn.
Do you approve?
I'll approve any dispositions you wanna make.
If you hadn't held the flank today, we'd have been whipped for fair.
Sherman, let's sit down a minute.
There's something I wanna say to you.
Lantern.
You may find yourself in command here.
Why?
I've seen some of the dispatches the newspaper correspondents have filed today.
They're saying
I was taken by surprise this morning.
You weren't taken by surprise.
I was.
No matter.
They're saying...
...I was drunk again last night.
Were you?
No.
But you can't fight front and rear.
Win or lose, tomorrow...
...I intend to resign.
Because of the newspapers?
Because of a general lack of confidence in me.
Oh, don't you think
I've ever felt like that?
A month ago they were saying
I was crazy. Insane.
Now they're calling me a hero.
A hero or crazy, I'm the same man.
It doesn't matter what the people think.
It's what you think, Grant.
You mean that's Grant?
I reckon.
General Grant.
You know this war's gonna be won in the West, and how to win it.
Everything you've done proves it.
And I say that a man has the right to resign only if he's wrong.
Not if he's right.
I guess I never thought of it that way.
I'll think it over.
What is there to think about?
The Army's better off with you than without you. That's the test.
All right.
Thanks.
There's a lot to do before morning, Sherman.
What are you doing?
Why did you make me do that?
Fire.
Hey, Zeb!
Didn't you get my letter?
I wrote more than four months ago.
She never was...
...quite the same after she got the news about Pa.
I don't think she minded going,
Zeb, except...
...she wanted to see you again.
Of course Pa ain't really there.
I put up a stone anyway.
Well...
...better be on my way.
Way? Where?
I need you, Zeb.
Only one thing brought me back.
She's...
Well, this farm is half yours.
I was thinking we'd finally clear away that patch of woods down by the river and...
You're twice the farmer I am.
You don't need me.
Farm's all yours. It's only fair.
Sure don't feel right about this.
What are you gonna do?
I haven't mustered out yet.
I can still transfer to the regulars.
Cavalry, maybe. Go west.
Have to fight Indians?
You sure are hard to make out, Zeb.
Now, what do you wanna do that for?
Do you like fighting?
You remember the story Pa used to tell us about fighting that grizzly bear?
Yeah.
And I asked him, I said,
"Well, why'd you get in such a fix?
Do you like fighting grizzlies?"
He said:
"Well, uh, not especially. Uh...
I just wanted to go somewhere and the bear was there first."
Well, I...
I guess I just wanna go somewhere too.
- So long.
- So long, Zeb.
Even while North and South
were being torn apart...
... East and West had been
drawn together by the Pony Express...
... the most daring mail route in history.
Eighty riders were in the saddle
at all times, night and day, in all weather.
Half of them riding east,
half riding west...
... between Missouri and Sacramento...
... carrying mail across country
in days instead of months.
Unarmed, they rode to save weight.
Five dollars a letter, the mail cost,
and on thin paper too.
It was courage, skill and speed...
... against hostile Indians, bandits,
hell and occasional high water.
Even as they rode,
men were already building...
... a faster message carrier across
the country: The Overland Telegraph.
And the Indians found
a new amusement...
... listening to the level tune
of the singing wires.
But far less amusing to the Indians...
... was the coming of the steel roadway
of the iron horse.
The surveyors, route lay through immense
natural barriers, the Rocky Mountains...
... and the equally discouraging
High Sierras.
But range upon range could never stop
the titanic contest...
... between two corporate giants
racing to put down...
... the greatest mileage of track
before they met.
The Central Pacific eastward
from Sacramento through the Sierras.
And the Union Pacific,
forging westward across the plains...
... with the Rockies still to come.
The prize in the race was free land,
vast parcels for every mile of track laid.
Land that would one day
be worth millions.
Hold it.
Set it down.
Workers, up.
Where'd you find them?
About a mile back yonder.
That's Johnny Hormatz.
That's Jack Perkin.
What the hell is this? A picnic?
- Well, the Indians got a couple of our men...
- Mister, you were the foreman here.
Now you're a tracklayer.
Now get back to work, all of you!
Move it!
Fast!
- You.
- Yes, sir.
You're the foreman till I can find somebody better.
- Yes, sir.
- Get them at it.
- Wait a minute.
- Move it!
Your name Jethro Stuart?
All right, get at it.
Well, Mr. Jethro Stuart, you're hired to hunt buffalo to feed these men...
...not to stop their work.
Why'd you bring these bodies here?
They're railroaders. I thought somebody in the railroad might be interested.
I'm the railroad and I'm not interested.
You should've buried them, then tracked down the Indians who did it.
Well, Mr. King, like you said,
I was hired to hunt...
...not to dig graves or fight Indians.
Those fellas are mostly old soldiers.
You wouldn't think a couple dead men bother them much.
I don't want anything in their thick skulls but their work. Do you understand?
Now, get rid of those bodies.
Start tracking those Indians.
You keep forgetting, Mr. King, my job's buffalo.
It was buffalo.
Go to the paymaster and draw your time.
Well, now, that foreman fella, you didn't fire him.
You just took him down a peg because you needed him.
Who's gonna shoot buffalo? You?
- What the devil is that?
- Milk.
Milk?
The Army must've changed since I was in it.
- Just rode in. I'm hungry.
- You are, huh?
But you'd rather watch them than eat.
- Is that it?
- That's it.
Well, I wish you were as eager to protect this railroad.
Did you get any word about those two men who were killed today?
I tracked the Arapahos and talked to the chief.
Those men were a mile off the right-of-way...
...where they had no business, drunk and chasing squaws.
- As much their fault as it was the Indians'.
- That a fact?
Well, soldier boy, your job is to fight Indians, not to agree with them.
Mr. King, there were 200 Arapahos and I had 20 men.
Now, to me...
...agreeing seemed wiser than fighting.
To you, huh?
Well, you know, I might just send off a wire to the colonel.
He may not agree.
I already reported. He does agree.
Acknowledged and understood. Sergeant.
Trouble, sir?
I don't know.
Hey, lieutenant.
I got a message:
Indians are up to something.
You know anything about it?
Chief says railroad busted the agreement.
Changed the route, come smack through Arapaho hunting grounds.
- You sure the chief's right?
- Plenty sure.
They're getting the war paint ready.
Can you stand there and tell me...
...that one little change is gonna cost the Arapahos one buffalo.
- Or even one jackrabbit?
- Mr. King.
They can be made to see it differently.
Who's hurting them?
What's a railroad anyway?
Two tracks and a whistle.
It's not the tracks they're afraid of.
It's what the tracks bring.
The buffalo hunters slaughtering off their herds.
And then the settlers coming in.
And when will that be?
Twenty, 30 years, maybe?
By then, we'll all be dead.
Right now we're just crossing the land.
That's all. Land that's safe to the Arapahos for our lifetime.
Now, you go talk to them.
Smoke a peace pipe with them.
Do anything they want.
Just get them to make a new agreement.
That's your job, isn't it?
Keeping the peace?
I'll keep the peace, Mr. King...
...but you keep your promise.
Hear your name's Rawlings, you're from Ohio.
Your pa's name couldn't be
Linus Rawlings, could it?
- Could be.
- Knew him.
Jethro Stuart.
- He used to speak of you.
- Used to?
Pa was killed at Shiloh.
Sit down, Mr. Stuart.
Well, better than dying behind a plow.
I tried it. Settled down for a year once.
Took 10 years off my life.
Your ma...
She must've been something real special getting old Linus to stay put.
She was, Mr. Stuart. Very special.
Old Linus.
Two years running once.
Your pa and me trapped together.
Up along the Waunakee.
Got so many beaver, we had to tie them tail-to-tail...
...just to drag them down the mountain.
Over a mile long it was, that line of beaver pelts.
Mr. Stuart, my father could take the truth and stretch it about six ways.
You sound just like him.
I'll take it you meant that kindly.
Well, I'd think twice before I called you a liar.
Tell me something, talking about liars.
Why would a son of old Linus get mixed up with a man like Mike King?
I know what you mean.
- But Mike King isn't the railroad.
- Oh?
I don't think he knows that.
He's changing the route back, is he?
No.
I know.
But he'd do anything to gain a day on the Central Pacific.
He's not a fool. He doesn't want a war, and neither do the Arapahos.
I think I could get them to agree to this change in route...
...if I sit down and talk with them for a while.
- How you gonna get them to do it?
- That's just it.
I need somebody that knows the language and who they trust.
You wouldn't happen to know someone like that, would you, Mr. Stuart?
Your pa could set a trap like no man I ever come across.
Just coax them on and, bam.
You'd better do something so he'll know you're pledging your word.
That blame whistle's like the crack of doom for all that's natural.
My ma felt a man ought to make his scratch on the land.
Leave it a little different than when he come.
Anyway, thanks for fixing things with the chief.
Me? I fixed nothing.
You put the words to my mouth but that won't make them come true.
Jethro, I said what I had to to keep the peace.
- I know there's a risk.
- Risk?
Maybe you don't understand.
You pledged your word back there.
Not mine, not the Army's, not the railroad's.
It's your word told them they'd keep their hunting grounds.
- I think they will.
- I think you got your neck stuck out...
...like a prairie chicken waiting for one side or the other to chop it off.
Your pa and me got kicked out of one territory after another...
...with people pouring in, killing off game, putting up towns.
It ain't gonna stop.
Your treaty's gonna get broke and
I don't wanna be around to see it happen.
Look me up when you get your bellyful.
- Where you going?
- Heading back to the mountains.
A high lonesome where there ain't no people at all yet.
So long.
By now, the Central Pacific had broken
through the wall of the high Sierras...
... and was straining eastward
across the flatlands of Nevada.
While the Union Pacific,
thanks to its long peace with the Indians...
... was able to keep up pressure
just as avidly in the opposite direction.
The competition was exciting,
but also costly...
... and both companies were itching
to earn money from tracks already laid.
Did the horses ride all right, Jake?
- No better than I did.
We'll have to rest them a day before we can start hunting rabbits, much less buffalo.
Just get them to water right away.
You say no buffalo hunter come.
White man, liar.
We scout for you no more.
Not in our lifetime, you said.
And there they are.
The buffalo slaughterers and the settlers.
All right, it's sooner than I figured.
But the railroad's broke.
They need money to keep moving on.
No people, no money.
No money, no railroad.
- It's as simple as that.
- What about the Arapahos?
Just take a look at those people.
Half of them straight from Europe.
They'll have a rough time, but they'll make it.
And do you wanna know why they'll make it?
Because they're willing to change their ways.
Arapahos will have to change too.
If they don't, they're finished.
I know they have to and someday the land will be taken over...
...by these farmers with their towns and their cattle.
But not like this.
They don't have to be double-crossed, and I don't have to be a part of it.
You don't, lieutenant?
Well, aren't you forgetting that uniform?
That's right, Mr. King, I'm forgetting it.
If the Army hasn't got any authority out here, I'm resigning. And now.
I don't see how that's gonna help the Arapahos.
Nothing will help them.
But nothing's gonna stop them.
Indian attack!
Indian attack! Take cover!
Take a good look.
You wanted a war and you got one.
I hope you're the first man killed in it.
Turn those wagons over!
Shoot for the lead horses.
Pick off the chief.
Rawlings, try that.
The Indians are stampeding the buffalo.
Dirty skunks. Come on.
I told you there'd be no war.
Look at them.
They've quit.
They'll be back.
They just sent a bunch of animals to kill an animal they call the "iron horse."
Well, it's still standing, isn't it?
And nothing's gonna stop it.
You think you can live with that?
I can live with it, or I can die with it.
Just listen.
You can live with that?
That?
That ain't crying.
That's just new life going on.
Pick up this woman and put the rest of the injured in the tent house.
Hey, Merv...
The rest of you, back to work.
We got a railroad to build.
Well...
Looks like you finally got your bellyful.
Hello, Jethro.
Appears you're doing well.
Can't complain.
Creek's loaded with beavers, fighting their way into the trap.
No white men looking over my shoulder...
...and the Indians are plumb cordial.
Toss your stuff in there.
Plenty of room for two.
Thanks.
You'll be bunking yonder.
Take your bearings now so you can find it when you need it.
If you don't like my snoring, you can build your own cabin.
I'll furnish the ax.
- Thanks. I'm just passing through.
- Through to where?
Anywhere you go is like where you've been.
Ain't you lost enough tail feathers back there?
I've been plucked some.
But that's what I like about this country.
There's always greener grass over the next hill.
Not no more.
Not since that damn railroad come.
All the grass is being staked out now, with a lock on it.
Maybe I'll just have to climb a little higher hill to find it.
How about coming along?
You crazy?
Like the Indians say, "These rocks and trees around here feel no call to move."
Why should I?
Guess I'm not an Indian, Jethro.
But I'm sure not a rock nor a tree.
Man belongs his own kind, like him or not.
The coming of railroads brought changes
in the land through which they passed.
Now immense herds of cattle were driven
hundreds of miles to meet the lines...
... bound for markets in the East.
Fences went up, cattle trails were barred...
... and a long and bloody wrangle began
between cattlemen and homesteaders.
The law was in the hands of whoever
could shoot fast and straight...
... except where there was somebody
determined to stand for law.
Others might look on sheep and a shepherd
as a pastoral scene.
Not the cattleman.
To him, sheep destroyed grass,
and grass came dear.
And if a man's life were held cheaper
than grass...
... it was considered a casualty of war,
not a crime.
And, in all this, the man with the star
was only one against many.
But time was running out
for the reckless ones...
... the desperadoes,
the gallop-and-gunshot boys...
... as more and more citizens demanded
respect for the law...
... and showed themselves ready to fight
to uphold it.
And the raw new towns that sprung up
in the West began to dream...
... of becoming as refined as that one-time
hooligan city by the Golden Gate.
San Francisco was now respectable.
So sophisticated, in fact,
it even had mansions up for auction.
Two thousand dollars.
Two thousand dollars.
Is that your last bid?
Ladies and gentlemen, this trophy is solid gold and fully inscribed.
"Mr. Cleve Van Valen, president.
San Francisco-Kansas City Railroad."
It's a treasure he held dear to his heart.
Do I hear $3000 for this priceless possession?
Priceless, my foot.
We used it for a doorstop.
- Twenty-five hundred.
- Twenty-five hundred dollars.
Twenty-five hundred dollars.
Twenty-five hundred? Sold $2500.
It's a sad day, Lilith.
Sad?
We made and spent three fortunes together.
What's so sad about that?
And if he'd lived a little longer, we would've made and spent another.
- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Van Valen.
- What?
The chair, it's been sold. I'm sorry.
Well then, take it.
Quit apologizing and take it.
Thank you, madam.
If there'd been some other way to pay off the debts...
It doesn't matter.
I've got two things no one can ever take from me:
This and my land in Arizona.
Lilith, I don't want to dash any hopes...
...but that ranch is nearly worthless.
Well, it's there, isn't it?
Yes, but most of the cattle have been sold off or stolen.
- I'll get cattle.
- You'll need someone to work it.
- Someone to manage it for you.
- I'll get that too.
Who?
My nephew.
He's a marshal out there somewhere.
Now, Lilith, at your age, it might be kind of rough.
Rough?
My ma and pa were killed going down the river just looking for land.
I guess I got a little of that Prescott blood in me after all.
Pa?
Is Aunt Lilith's house on Nob Hill as high as that?
I don't know, son.
On our way home, you ask your aunt Lilith.
She'll tell you.
Honey? Do you think you'll know her?
- What?
- You aunt Lilith.
- Do you think you'll recognize her?
- Sure.
Zeb? What's the matter?
Nothing.
Come on.
Thank you.
- Ma'am, are you our great-aunt Lilith?
- If you're Zeb's children, I am.
- Lilith.
- Zeb.
Zeb Rawlings.
Oh, goodness.
I swore up and down I wasn't gonna cry.
You're just as pretty as Ma said you was.
I'd like you to meet my wife, Julie.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm pleased to meet you too.
I just can't tell you how pleased.
This here's Eve, underneath all the jam.
- Come on and meet Sam now.
- Sam?
Sam's our horse.
He could pull two wagons if he wanted.
Oh, well, if you'll excuse me,
I have my orders to meet Sam.
Come on.
- Oh, just a minute now, boys.
- But he's on the other side.
Come on.
Okay.
Come on.
Just a minute.
I think this means a whole lot to her.
You have no idea how much it means to me...
...to be able to settle down to a life of peace and quiet.
I'll get the luggage.
Hello, boys.
Jake.
Tom.
Pablo.
Zeb. Let's go.
Now, marshal, don't tell me you come all the way to Gold City just to meet me?
I hardly expected it.
And the beautiful... Mrs. Rawlings?
What a pleasure.
I envy you, marshal.
A well-favored, bright-eyed wife...
...just as dazzling as that sun up there.
Makes you almost thankful, don't it?
It makes a person wanna live.
That's Charlie Gant.
I thought you said he was in Montana.
Zeb?
I'm just gonna get the luggage, that's all.
See to the rooms, will you, Julie?
- Prescott, take care of the horses.
- Yes, sir.
- Linus, help your mother.
- Yes, sir.
Anything wrong, Julie?
No. No, nothing.
Come on, Eve.
- Lou.
- Zeb.
Got a minute?
Of course I got a minute.
Here.
Now, I urge you, most respectfully to peruse the...
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.
Well, what can I do for you?
Go ahead, name it.
I saw Gant get off the train this morning.
There were three men waiting for him.
That's why you're here, huh?
That's it.
Look, there ain't a thing we can do...
...to keep Charlie Gant from going where he wants to in this territory.
I know. I know what he was...
...but that's over now.
It was over the day his brother got...
Should've killed them both that day, but...
Well, you didn't.
There ain't a thing I can do about it now.
What's he doing here, Lou?
Ain't you even curious?
Well, what do you want me to do?
Run him out of town at the point of a gun?
Do you think we still put the law inside a holster here?
Look over there, Zeb. There's the law.
With all its writs and decrees and...
- We abide by that circuit judge now.
- How many get killed meantime?
Nobody's got killed. Nobody's going to.
Doc Holliday, the Clantons, the Youngers...
- They're all gone now.
- Charlie Gant ain't gone.
You get me a warrant. I'll get you Gant.
Lou? They want three guards in the wagon with the gold shipment tomorrow.
- Three?
- This is a big one. Over $100,000 worth.
I'll take Clayton and Sims with me, all right?
Well?
Well what?
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- It means we put on a three-man guard.
- To the train.
What happens then?
You know there's gold going out here every month or so.
There hasn't been a train robbery since Jesse James was killed.
Now, if the councilors wish to have a conference, we'll have one.
Zeb.
I don't want any trouble here now.
We've been friends a long time.
As a friend...
...I'd like you to leave town.
Boys, get back from there.
Look down there, son.
- Do you know how deep that shaft is?
- Uh-uh.
That's a thousand foot deep.
Do you know how deep a thousand foot is?
Uh-uh.
Well, if you had 200 brothers, all standing on your shoulders...
...you wouldn't be able to see over the top.
- I'd be squished.
Come on.
I'll show you boys the donkey engine.
You boys go ahead.
I'll be along in a minute.
I hear you've been talking to the local marshal about me.
- Would you call that friendly?
- I never considered us exactly friendly.
I don't like you, marshal.
I don't like what you and your kind are doing to this country.
Now, I don't want any trouble.
But you wanna put things on the old basis, just you and me?
That's fine.
I'm not gonna get in a fight with you, Gant.
It's peace you want, huh, marshal?
Peace?
There's only one kind I know of.
That's the kind my brother's got.
What happened to your brother didn't teach you very much, did it?
Easy, marshal.
Floyd never made mistakes...
...except the one time he trusted you.
And you're the one that got away.
One of these days, I'm likely to pay you Rawlingses a little visit.
Come on, move along.
Get those gold boxes up there.
That's a lot of gold.
Come on, keep moving, boys.
Zeb?
Lou Ramsey's here.
Lou.
- I warned you, Zeb.
- What is it?
Gant came to see me last night.
Said you tried to start some trouble with him.
You believe him?
I'm telling you, Zeb, you take your trouble to your own territory.
I don't want any more of it here.
There won't be any more trouble, Lou.
Gant's gone.
Rode out of here early this morning.
With who?
His gang.
They should be somewhere between here and Kingman...
...waiting on that train.
You don't fool me for a minute, Zeb.
You are not looking for a robbery, you're looking for Gant.
You still carry lead where he shot you.
That was Texas.
And Oklahoma, where you killed Floyd.
And now this.
I'm sorry, Julie...
...but I don't want my office to be any part of this.
Zeb?
The boys have got the team hitched.
I know.
It's almost time to go.
Zeb?
- Julie.
- No one's asking you to face Gant.
No one's making you.
We could ride out of here right now.
We could forget it.
Maybe there's something you haven't told me.
Is there, Zeb?
I'm asking you not to go.
Please.
Don't go.
Sorry, Julie.
I guess there's nothing more pigheaded in a man than his sense of honor.
They're all the same, every one of them.
You take my Cleve now.
Never could turn down a poker game.
Felt duty-bound to go.
Three nights running sometimes, but he wouldn't quit...
...not if his life depended on it. He...
I guess it isn't very funny.
Ma?
Where's Pa?
Out. That's where he is.
- What's the matter with Mom?
Nothing's the matter.
Come on, now, in the other room.
- What's the matter?
Come on, we're gonna play.
That's a good girl. That's better.
What's the matter with Mama?
- Nothing's the matter.
Do you know any games?
We know tag.
Musical chairs.
- Ugh. Tag.
- I know hide-and-seek.
Well, do you know how to play poker?
- Poker?
- Poker?
You're in luck. Sit down right there.
Now, come on, sit down. That's it.
But we don't know how to play poker.
Well, it's time you learned.
First, we'll start off with a little five-card stud.
I'll take that rifle, Zeb.
Your pistol too.
Sorry, Lou.
I just can't oblige.
Thought the law wouldn't let you use that anymore.
I'll use it if I have to.
I'm going out of here, Lou, and I'm taking this with me.
To kill Gant.
That's what you think, isn't it?
It's something personal between him and me.
Well, Lou, it could be...
...if I settle down with my family and wait for him to come.
And he'll come if I don't stop him here and now.
I'm gonna catch Gant red-handed, breaking the law...
...and then I'm gonna use the law to put him away once and for all.
The law, Lou.
I'm gonna use the law...
...but I haven't got much chance without your help.
How many men in the caboose?
Just one brakeman.
- Is he armed?
- No, never has been.
I'll be in the express car.
Thanks, Lou.
Marshal?
There's some riders up ahead.
I'll take a look.
Engineer, there's a barricade ahead!
Open it up, wide open.
Zeb!
Come on. Come on.
Everyone make it?
- Frenchy's horse fell.
- I don't think he made it.
- Well, let's move.
It's a long way from here to that gold.
There's no danger. Just keep going.
It's Rawlings.
Back this train up!
And fast!
How come we're leaving so early, Pa?
We got a long way to go, son.
Here.
Auntie, when we going to your house?
Your daddy will decide when we get to your home.
Auntie, can we take Sam with us?
I think Sam is taking us.
Pa, how much further is it to Aunt Lilith's ranch?
Well, son, it's around the next bend, the next bend...
...and the valley beyond.
- Oh.
- Aunt Lilith, do you know that song?
LINUS: That's our song.
Your song?
I sang that song long before your pa was ever born.
Come on.
Zeb.
The West that was won by its pioneers,
settlers, adventurers is long gone now.
Yet it is theirs forever.
For they left tracks in history
that will never be eroded by wind or rain...
... never plowed under by tractors,
never buried in the compost of events.
Out of the hard simplicity of their lives,
out of their vitality...
... their hopes and their sorrows...
... grew legends of courage and pride...
... to inspire their children
and their children's children.
From soil enriched by their blood...
... out of their fever to explore and build...
... came lakes where once
were burning deserts...
... came the goods of the earth,
mines and wheat fields...
... orchards and great lumber mills...
... all the sinews of a growing country.
Out of their rude settlements,
their trading posts, came cities...
... to rank among the great ones
of the world.
All the heritage of a people
free to dream...
... free to act,
free to mold their own destiny.
Throw your map away.
- There she is... Talua.
- Where?
- Dead ahead.
- That's it?
- Yep.
- No wonder I missed it.
Half a walnut on a plate of ocean.
You're learning.
Make the announcement to our passengers.
We're coming in.
Gentlemen, nous sommes arrivés.
We are here. We're going down now.
- Tahiti already?
- Talua.
Talua? Why?
We're stopping overnight.
- Hey, Harry!
- Hey!
He says we go down now.
Yeah? Why wasn't I consulted?
We can go down now.
Hey, that ain't Tahiti!
I was dreaming of a nice, fat native woman.
She was bending over me.
Hey, did I hear him say we stay overnight?
- Overnight? For what?
- Good jail here, Harry.
Steaks, champagne.
Hey, flyboy!
What are we stopping all night for?
All right, wise guy, you speak English.
Why don't you answer me when I ask you a question? Where are we?
- Talua.
- Talua.
That's at least 500 miles from Tahiti.
- Yeah.
- Why are we stopping overnight?
I think I'm the reason.
I get off at Talua.
So that takes ten minutes.
What are they staying all night for?
- I believe we're going to...
- You are a passenger.
You are not the cruise director.
I'll answer the questions.
Then answer the questions.
What are we doing here?
Why are we staying overnight?
- You crud!
- It's my fault.
I'm sorry if I inconvenienced you.
It's all right, white-collar.
But the next time, you'd better tell me about it.
All right, flyboy, you can put her down now.
The plane! The plane!
She's coming in!
After you, monsieur.
I appreciate the argument.
What, no reception committee?
No champagne, huh?
I apologize, Charlie.
These people cannot be French.
There would be champagne for everybody.
Hey, white-collar! What happened?
No reception committee?
You can register at the hotel.
They have rooms upstairs.
- Shall I register for you?
- No, thanks.
I have accommodations.
You have accommodations on every island.
Courage, my boy. It takes time!
Oh, look!
Don't lock the door tonight, chérie!
I'm coming back with a big surprise.
Come on!
Well, I leave you here.
Oh, don't look now...
...but we have an important spectator.
Who?
The governor, at his balcony.
He's not going to like the visitors we brought to his island paradise.
I'll have some explaining to do.
Be thankful now you are the co-pilot.
- Goodbye for now.
- So long, white-collar.
Good luck with your flock.
Flock. Island pigs.
God go with you.
- God? Who's he?
- Search me. I never heard of the man.
It's a way of swearing, you know.
Oh, Jacques.
Thank you for everything, getting me here safely.
Wait a few weeks before you thank me, Father.
Goodbye and good luck.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello. Is Father Doonan here?
Yes. Come in, please.
- He's in there.
- Thank you.
Father Doonan.
Father Joseph Perreau.
Well, welcome to paradise.
Have a seat.
Perreau? French, huh?
My father was French-Canadian.
My mother's American.
I was born in North Dakota.
The name will help. That's probably a reasons they sent you.
- They're getting smarter up on the hill.
- Father Superior did say...
Yes, I can guess what he said.
- How was your trip?
- All right, for the most part.
We had a bit of excitement.
Three convicts aboard.
Yes, yes. I saw them and I heard them.
We'll put them to work.
They looked able-bodied.
- They're only staying overnight.
- Learn this now.
Grab whatever you can for labour.
Grab it or you beg for it.
Most of the labour will be convict labour. Don't be sensitive.
- I see.
- No, you don't see.
But you will soon enough.
There's a job to be done up at the hospital, and they'll do it.
- How tired are you?
- Oh, I'm rested enough.
I've been sitting on planes for 72 hours.
Good. We'll start breaking you in right away then.
We'll leave for the hospital this morning. The sooner the better.
Before I clear out of here tomorrow,
I'll introduce you to the governor.
You can form your own opinion about him.
And I'll also bring you together with some of the...
...noble Christians of the town.
The brethren.
You'll want to wash up first.
I'll show you.
You remember when France was called the eldest daughter of the church?
- Yes, I do.
- She's slipped a little, with my help.
The john's in there.
It's a little messy in here now, but we'll be sleeping up at the hospital tonight.
Have you had your breakfast?
I said, have you had your breakfast?
- Breakfast?
- Oh, no, not yet.
We'll grab some coffee and a bun over at the bistro.
Oh, I'd prefer to say Mass first, if it's all right with you, if there's time.
No, there isn't time. But it's all right.
After all, that's what you came for, isn't it?
Yes, it is, Father. One of the things.
Well, then, you do it.
You just go ahead and do it.
They'll be off the island and out of your hands...
...tomorrow afternoon.
And so will Father Doonan.
- He's leaving with us.
- Father Doonan does not concern me.
His bishop is removing him.
I had nothing to do with it.
- Of course, sir. I understand.
- Father Doonan!
Father Doonan! It is his fault
I have to tolerate this riffraff...
...on my island, even 24 hours.
Anybody else could get business conducted and be gone.
But not Father Doonan.
No. He needs a whole day.
But he has to show everything to the new priest, introduce him around.
These men are not too difficult, sir.
I'm certain there will be no problem.
You are certain?
Have you read this?
A guard was stabbed when they broke out of Tahiti jail.
These men are desperadoes
Tahiti found necessary...
...to keep under all possible restraint.
Potential murderers.
If they escaped from Tahiti jail, they can escape from here a lot easier.
They might break into the home of some family at night.
No problem.
Go back!
They may not know any better, but you do!
You lay that gun butt on me one more time...
...l'm gonna strangle you with these things till your eyes come out!
All right, my little friend, we have a place for you.
Cool and comfortable. Let's go.
Everybody letting off a little steam, eh?
Yeah. Must be contagious.
Let's go.
- Grellou!
- Yes, sir.
My call to Tahiti, the volcanic observatory.
- What happened to it?
- They are trying, sir.
It should come through any minute.
I will check again.
It's coughing again, the old devil.
But it's coughed before.
Get out. I have more important things to think of than you...
...this scum you bring me.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Your call, sir. Tahiti is ready.
Hello? Speaking.
I am not unduly excited!
I reported once before this morning that the mountain belched!
I'm reporting again!
Two minutes ago. Yes.
This time, darker cloud, smoke.
You stopped? Why?
Have a look.
The old dog teaching the new dog tricks.
Begging.
Why must they always do that?
They must be going up to the hospital.
Which is why they'll get nothing.
Watch.
What did I tell you?
Tomorrow afternoon,
3:00. We take off.
You'll be ready?
Our island-hopping Casanova.
The lady with him, is she a parishioner?
Name of Clarisse, part French, part island.
I can remember when she went to Mass.
- Well, he's a good pilot.
- He's a better salesman, I think.
He's better than I ever was.
You weren't exactly selling the same wares.
No.
- Can I ask a question?
- Why not?
Why, when they insult you that way, do you go on begging?
I guess it's a kind of a game we play between us...
...to see which of us can be meaner in the eyes of heaven.
This is my last day, but I'm not going to let them off the hook.
Watch this performance.
Gaston.
Gaston, your new shepherd,
Father Perreau.
- Perreau?
- French and American.
Well, it's better than nothing.
It's... He means it's better than being Irish.
New York Irish, especially, eh, Gaston?
- Bonjour, mon père. Welcome to Talua.
- Thank you.
Oh, and in the doorway, click, click, Madame Lafarge.
We dine with you.
Coffee and a couple of croissants.
And, I know that as God-fearing
Christian people...
...you will want to contribute a little something...
...anything at all, to those less fortunate.
Why do you do this?
You'll see, the hospital gets official provisions twice a month.
- Is not enough?
- No, it is not enough, and you know it.
Oh, I gave a whole package of that sugar last time.
That was six months ago.
Now it is that time again.
And your wife I am sure will want to contribute a little something...
...out of that very spacious wardrobe that she prizes so much.
Nothing out of Dior, you understand, madame.
A rag. Anything.
Oh, what's the good of dressing up those little, uh, corpses?
That's what they'd be all right,
I guess, if you had your way.
All right, I'll look.
I have one more call to make.
Be right with you.
Good morning, Louis.
I must go to the hospital.
The usual magazines.
I wouldn't think of asking for anything more.
No, no, no, no.
No, no. Oh, this is new.
Last month's only.
Okay, Louis.
Anything you can spare.
Though she's pregnant, she's still popular.
A pity...
Is that it, Louis?
Thank you very much.
It's all right, Fouquette.
You can open your eyes now and talk. I'm leaving.
Some priest...
Cognac and sex magazines.
The magazines?
They're for the hospital.
You think he read them?
If I know this one, first he reads them.
- Tomorrow he goes. Good riddance.
- You bet.
Let's go.
Father Perreau, Aristide.
We are late getting started.
It's going to be hot.
How is she running?
Who knows?
I work on her all morning.
I hate the combustion engine.
She is just like the woman.
So I treat her like the woman.
Big stick, little affection.
Let her bump her way to hell.
All right. But first, to the compound.
All right, boys, in the truck.
You've got three more.
The new ones, where are they?
Come... Oh, now, come on. Come on.
I've got things to fix at the hospital.
I need men who can swing a hammer.
Come on! We're late and it's hot!
Talk to the governor.
Have you got them in that pit in this weather with no air?
- Why, they'll die in there.
- We have buried better.
- Get them out! Now!
- You don't order me, Father.
You or God.
Father!
- These men are killers.
- And this is murder!
Get that gate closed!
Close that trap.
Corporal! Let the prisoners up.
Come on, come on, come on. Come on, up!
Come on! You're all right.
You'll make it.
Here. I got him.
All right, I'll get him.
I got him.
Open the gate.
- Cognac! Quick!
- There's some in my bag.
Lousy, stinking cruds.
Take it easy, take it easy.
You'll be all right.
I'm taking these men with me.
Still giving orders, huh?
You can't run your church, but you continue to tell me...
...how to run this island.
I'm entitled to free convict labour, all you've got.
Father Doonan.
- These men are not my prisoners.
- They're on this island.
- In transit to Tahiti.
- In the meantime...
...stick them in the pit, huh?
Let them suffocate.
You gave that order, right?
They're potential murderers.
Loose, they are dangerous.
There isn't room enough for one man in that pit.
You stuck three of them in there to fry alive!
Control yourself.
Keep your voice down.
You haven't begun to hear me yet.
Tomorrow, I'll be in Tahiti, the governor-general's office.
They'll not only hear me there, they'll hear me all the way to Paris!
- Have you ever been in that hole?
- You're being insolent.
- You're being inhuman and you know it!
- You belong down that hole.
You're crazy. You've been crazy ever since you came to this island.
No wonder you're being replaced.
I haven't been replaced yet.
Those pigs!
You know, they could have killed us?
Shut up.
It'll take more than a little steam to kill you, Butcher.
Look, done your figure good.
At least, we have a cognac breakfast.
All right now, on your feet, boys.
- Turn the truck around, Aristide.
- Hey, Holy Joe.
We don't owe you nothing, so don't start pushing.
Where are you from, tough guy?
I hear echoes.
I've been around.
- What's it to you?
- You spit your T's.
That'd be Jersey, I'd guess.
Maybe Jersey City, huh?
I come from just across the river, Hell's Kitchen.
We used to eat punks like you.
Maybe. That's when you had your teeth.
Father Doonan!
Yes?
I've decided to let you take the prisoners.
But you will vouch for their conduct.
You will be responsible for them.
- I think I can handle it.
- lf they should escape...
If one of them escapes, you'll answer to me.
Understood, my friend?
All right, on the truck.
You too.
Hop aboard.
Come on, come on.
That's it.
Good heaven's, man, watch it!
Look out!
You fool! That could have been us, that rock.
All the way down to hell, eh?
- Slow down!
- Why? We are in a hurry.
- I said, slow down!
- Please, let him watch the road.
Maybe somebody afraid to die, eh?
Hey, how about that?
Do priests go to hell?
Maybe priests who push people around...
...priests with the bad temper, eh?
- Shut up and drive.
- Okay by me.
I drive. You pray.
Matron, the truck is here, and Father Doonan!
All right, men, on your feet. Move!
There's work to be done.
- Move?
- That's what the man said.
I don't move. Get the doctor.
I'm a hospital case.
Lousy driver. I got blisters on my bones.
You'll live, both of you.
Come on now, move, move.
Get this stuff unloaded.
Pile them against that building over there.
Hello, Marguerite.
How are you?
Sonia, how are you?
I got a present for you.
- Where's Camille?
- Off duty. She sleeps.
What's for me?
Nothing for you. Noth...
You come up here empty-handed?
Back in the truck.
Oh, excuse me.
Hey, Butcher, we're supposed to move the junk, not her.
Eh? Oh.
Hey, what do we need this stuff for?
- We rebuilding the place?
- Only the chapel. Come on.
- We're repairing what?
- The chapel. The chapel.
- Come on, move.
- Did he say chapel?
I think I heard him, Harry.
Me, I don't like chapels.
Okay, buster, just keep moving.
The name's Charlie, and like I said,
Mr. Priest, I don't dig chapels.
I didn't ask you to dig it.
You're gonna repair it.
- We're gonna repair it?
- You heard me.
You hear what the man said.
We're gonna repair it.
Hallelujah! It's the work of the Lord!
Hallelujah.
I don't want to shake you up, Pops, but you got the wrong union.
Father Doonan! Welcome!
Dr. Wexler! How are you?
Now you take over here. After you get all this piled against that building...
...all of it, then give them a 10-minute rest.
I'll be back by then to tell you where to start.
- Do you know how to use this?
- Yes, sir.
I wouldn't advise any of you to get restless and make a break for it.
It's a 2,000-foot straight drop to the ocean all around here.
That is, all except the road and we'll be watching that.
Of course, you can always try.
Father Perreau!
I'm sorry.
- This is Marguerite, our matron.
- How do you do?
- Doctor Wexler.
- How do you do?
- And nurse Sonia.
- Hello.
We'll put some meat on your bones, mon père.
Where I come from we don't like
les maigrelets, the skinnies!
Give me that bag, if you would.
Thank you.
And for Sonia, from Madame Poiret,
I think.
Muumuus!
An invention of the missionary, huh? No chic!
Now, for Camille.
Tell her what it is, stupid.
Eh, men!
Well, it's a scarf, Camille, or a kind of a shawl.
It has fringe all around the edges...
...and I guess, you could wear it over your head at noon...
...to keep the sun off, or, I suppose in the evening when it's cool...
...you could throw it around your shoulders.
- Why don't you put it on?
- Put it on, he says! Show her!
You show her.
It's beautiful!
Oh, it looks beautiful on you.
A lady in the village wanted you to have it.
Oh, how nice.
It's lovely on you, chérie.
Now, where is mine?
Where is my present?
- I didn't bring you anything.
- No magazine?
- No.
- You come up without my magazine?
I've brought you enough magazines.
You shouldn't read that stuff.
I will decide what I read!
I like my magazine.
- I need them.
- Yeah, they're no good. They're filth!
So? A little filth...
...a little imagination goes a long way, huh?
It keeps me here doing your work.
I could be à Paris.
Yeah. Voilà! Brigitte!
And cigarettes? American?
None of that French duckweed, huh?
Doctor.
Thank you.
There. Now, now, now, now.
You like it, chérie?
I like it.
This ain't a bad dump.
Too good for a hospital.
Hey, look at that view down there.
Ain't that pretty.
Hey Harry, what kind of a hospital is it?
Hey, it's a kid's hospital.
Hey! What's got into them?
- Who?
- Them.
Lepers.
Oh, boy! What I could do with a nice cold pitcher of beer.
Make it a barrel.
Beer! Beer is for peasants.
But, chilled wine and a warm woman.
Get away!
Get away from me!
Go on, kid. Beat it!
Go on back where you belong. Go on!
You heard what the man said.
Beat it! Scram!
Nappy! Napoleon!
You fools! There is no danger.
You'll not catch anything.
Men! Big, brave muscle-men!
Idiots!
What's all this?
What are you crying about?
Now, no one with the name of Napoleon should ever cry.
That's better.
You can relax.
It's not contagious, except in the early stages.
You don't think
I'd bring you up here, do you?
Now that happens to be the truth.
There are medicines now that... Look at me.
I've been handling them for years.
You got a voodoo, Mr. Priest.
We got no voodoo.
- It's not contagious.
- He says.
We were sentenced to jail, not leprosy.
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Jean?
Marianne?
- Yes, Camille.
- Coming, Camille.
Doctor's ready for your new dressings.
Oh, okay. Come on. Okay.
She's pretty, but there's nothing to grab...
...not enough meat on the bone.
Still the butcher.
There's a difference.
As they say in Jersey,
vive la différence!
I tell you that's a chick, man.
My kind of chick.
What's she doing way up here, Harry?
Lost, up here in this dump?
- Search me.
- I admit, it's a waste.
You know, maybe it ain't such a waste.
A day's wages for the workers in the vineyard.
I'll bet you were a sweet little altar boy.
Weren't we all?
Be careful, mon vieux. Non?
Number one.
In the bushes.
- Who is it?
- It's all right. Nothing to worry about.
- It's a great night, isn't it?
- Yes.
It smells very sweet.
I never heard so many squawking birds.
They're singing.
They sing loudest for the moon.
People on the island say the moon is their lost lover.
The birds are begging for it to return.
They'll be singing a long time.
You're one of the workmen fixing our chapel.
Is that what they told you?
Father Doonan also said you're prisoners.
You're going to jail in Tahiti.
That's right.
I knew he wouldn't let that pass.
Yeah, I've been a bum most of my life, in and out of jails.
- What's your name?
- Camille.
- I don't think you're...
- What?
What you say, a bum.
The better part of me is, I guess.
Camille? That's French, huh?
Half French.
The other half belonging here.
Well, I'd say that you got two nice halves.
I like the way they're put together.
Relax, relax. I just want to tell you about the moon.
Oh, I'd like that.
And I like your hand there.
Good.
- What name do you have?
- Harry.
Harry.
You know, you're too pretty to be cooped-up in a joint like this...
...halfway to the top of the world.
How come?
How come you're here?
I've been here a long time, many years.
Father Doonan first brought me to the mountain when I was a little girl.
I was 8.
You've been here since you were 8?
I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
I like being with the children.
And I'm useful.
Yeah, but, don't you ever get down to the town?
I mean if you call it a town, for kicks, you know?
Kicks? What is kicks?
Well, breaking out, baby.
You know, having a few drinks.
Maybe dance a little bit.
Bust up one of the joints for laughs.
Is that what it's like, being in town?
- You mean you've never been?
- No. No, never.
You were going to tell me about the moon, Harry.
Yeah, about the moon.
Well, that was...
...just conversation, that was for openers.
Oh, please tell me.
I would like you to tell me, everything that's out there.
But that'd be wasting a lot of precious minutes...
...and I haven't got those kind of minutes to waste.
Besides, you've seen it all, eight million times.
No. I've never seen the moon.
Oh, that's silly.
I'm blind.
Didn't you know?
Didn't you?
No, I didn't know.
I'm sorry.
I'm going to kiss you, Camille.
Why, you!
- Harry?
- Are you all right?
It's Father Doonan.
- Yes, yes.
- You interfering crud.
What kind of an animal are you?
Don't you realize she's blind? Blind!
I know she's blind, but I'm not!
I saw it and I liked it!
Harry! Harry!
Harry!
Father Doonan! Harry!
Get back there.
Nice going, Mr. Priest.
You're brave. Real brave.
Harry's been in that sweat box all morning!
He ain't been eating good, worked the whole day for you.
And you try to choke him.
Nice going, man! Nice going!
Get back, I said!
Get her inside.
Yes, I drink too!
And none of your sermons.
- I didn't say anything.
- It's on your face.
Now, this is your job now!
Get those thugs up at 5:00 in the morning.
- We'll be going down before dawn.
- Yes, sir.
We'll all be out of your hair tomorrow.
We'll be on that plane at 3:00.
Let him go. He can take care of himself.
Can he? He's half-mad.
He'll soon be drunk.
You didn't see what I just saw.
He almost killed a man with his hands.
- One of the convicts?
- Harry.
Maybe Harry had it coming to him.
From a priest of God?
Your morality, not mine.
What did you expect to meet?
A saint? Damien of the lepers?
I'd like to help him, doctor.
I happen to know his problems.
There were reports at the monastery...
...from everyone, the governor down.
- You don't know his problems.
- You do, I suppose?
- I know this much.
You're not going to help him with...
With your penny catechism lectures.
I'm sorry.
I'm obviously taking up your time.
Hold a minute, please.
I'm sometimes too old, too cynical.
Scratch a doctor and you'll find an atheist.
We'll be working together.
We should be friends.
Tell me, will you? Somebody tell me, why is he this way?
I don't mean just the alcoholism.
Why has he lost his faith?
Has he lost it, completely?
He's an angry man, yes...
...and bitter and frustrated, but...
I don't really know about this thing you call faith.
I'm not religionist.
Religion, in my opinion, is for busybodies.
That's good, coming from you.
You're here when you could be in a plush office somewhere.
You're here with a handful of leprous kids.
But religion's for busybodies?
What are you?
Touché. But its not called leprosy anymore.
The official name now is Hansen's disease. Remember that.
Yes, I should have. I'm sorry.
You know, you and I might have some good talks together...
...just like Father Doonan and I used to have.
Too often we stayed up half the night arguing.
Arguing the only worthwhile questions...
God, the soul, life, science.
Sit down, my friend.
I'll pour you some coffee.
Father Doonan came to this island some 16, 17 years ago.
I wasn't here then. I was on the staff...
...at Molokai in the Hawaiian Islands.
From what I'm told, his first years on Talua were good years.
The church in the village was full every
Sunday, and he was a good priest.
He made converts among the natives, many converts.
He built two chapels out in the country for our island people.
For two, three years all goes well...
...till the day Father Doonan stumbles on our horrible secret...
...there's Hansen's disease on these islands.
- Secret?
- Yes, secret. This...
This scare word leprosy terrifies people.
Do they know what they should know?
Do you know? Of all the communicable diseases...
...leprosy is now the least communicable... The least.
Since 1924, we have drugs.
The sulfone family:
Promine, diasone, promizole.
Hansen's disease is kaput.
Did you know that?
Well, I didn't until I did some reading just before taking this assignment.
I was as guilty as anybody.
I always thought of leprosy...
...as the horror of biblical times.
Yeah, unclean. Nonsense!
And Father Doonan knew it was nonsense.
So, 15 years ago he built this hospital.
Not only for our children, the children of all the islands.
All you see here he built with his own two hands...
...and what convict labour he could scrounge.
He brought me here.
He needed a doctor.
He gave me no rest.
I came.
You met our matron, Marguerite?
In Paris, in the Montmartre...
...she was a prostitute, a common streetwalker.
Some of your people, nuns, got ahold of her and sent her here.
Father Doonan welcomed her.
For years she is here now...
...doing penance.
Noisy but a treasure.
Then with Sonia and Camille...
...Father Doonan got himself a staff, such as it is.
Then what went wrong?
Religion?
The Sermon on the Mount?
Let's be fair.
Human nature.
Our noble citizens of Talua didn't want a leper hospital...
...not on their beautiful island.
It would kill the tourist business.
The natives too?
These are their own children.
Everybody turned against him.
They said get rid of your hospital.
When he wouldn't, when he didn't...
...they boycotted him and his church.
You're a priest, have you any idea...
...how it feels to be saying
Mass for yourself alone...
...no congregation?
There was nothing of this in any of his reports to the monastery.
Why complain?
He probably blamed himself.
But I can tell you up to a few years ago...
...he was still trusting, praying they'd forgive him.
One day they would all come back to the church and the sacraments.
They never came.
And now here you are, bright and new taking over for him...
...taking his hospital, and asking about faith, Father Doonan's faith.
Do you know that I never once heard him blame God?
In the humble opinion of a scientist...
...if there's anything to that stuff you sell...
...he might have gotten a little...
...just a little help from up there!
Did it come?
No!
I've had to watch a good man...
No saint, but a good man...
Crumble, crack open at the seams.
It's only the last two or three years he started this drinking.
It's gotten worse.
Faith.
I don't know now what he believes if anything.
And who cares?
But this I do know:
Drunk, crazy, awful temper...
He's, for me, a great man.
My friend...
...and a great, great man.
Good morning.
It's not such a good morning, Father.
The three convicts have escaped.
- Where's the constable?
- He's looking for them.
He must've been sleeping.
We've all be searching.
Well, let them go. They're halfway down the mountain by now.
They can't get off the island.
Forget them.
All right, Aristide. Let's go.
Well, Dr. Wexler, keep the faith with bandages.
- Take care of yourself, mon ami.
- Yeah.
Marguerite.
Now, be a good girl,
Marguerite, huh?
Be a good girl.
Sonia.
Where's Camille?
Here.
- Harry?
- Camille.
Camille, Harry had to leave a little early and...
But I'll see him on the plane and I'll say goodbye for you.
And you are going too?
That's right.
I will miss you, mon père.
Yes. Sure.
We're all gonna miss one another.
But you're gonna be a good girl, aren't you?
Let's go.
Something's burning.
You smell it?
- The engine. Maybe it's overheated.
- This engine? My engine? Never!
- Better stop, Aristide. We'll check it.
- But I tell you...
I said stop, didn't I?
Not my engine.
But something stinks.
Sulphur. It's the mountain again.
It's awfully quiet, isn't it?
What happened to the birds?
Earthquake.
I just felt the devil pass under my feet.
We've got company.
Get on.
You missed our show.
- Sit down, my darling.
- Thank you.
Come on, Louis.
I need a shave before breakfast.
A shave, monsieur.
Yes, madame, finis. Through.
Even the wind has changed.
Look. You can see the radio tower again.
Back to your warm bed,
ma chérie.
It was hiccups.
The old man hiccupped in the night.
Margot! Look at yourself!
Inside, please! Quick!
Come on, Louis.
Quick!
Such brave citizens.
Once in 10 years, the old beast up in the attic puffs a cigarette...
...and the whole island moves into convulsions.
Born here, and they act like tourists.
No. They're all women.
The whole island is full of women.
They drink too much wine.
They get too much sun.
They get too much sun.
They are all crazy with the heat.
Like the priest.
We know he's crazy.
Father Doonan?
What did he do?
Wanted me to drive him up the mountain.
He has the hole in the head.
We just came down.
He's worrying about his lepers now.
What about me, my truck?
Is there a road? It is gone.
With our own eyes we see.
The whole mountain fell into the ocean.
Take him up, Aristide.
Road or no road.
Heaven will reward you.
Heaven? I've yet to see the check from heaven the bank cashes.
No, on this island everybody is either mad or they are sheep!
No, on this island everybody is either mad or they are sheep!
Hello? Hello? Hospital!
Hello? Hospital!
- Hello?
- The line is probably down.
It can't be down.
I've got to get through!
- Hello! Hospital!
- Help! Help!
Help!
I said, no!
You are not flying out of here!
I've declared a state of emergency.
You're both under military orders!
Another cable from the observatory at Papeete.
- They must have more information.
- Send the latest readings.
Tell them the findings of aerial reconnaissance will follow.
Has the radio room reached the freighter?
- Not yet, sir.
- I want that ship headed back here.
Yes, sir.
I may have to clear the entire population off this island.
I can't with a schooner and one foolish aeroplane.
You will fly over the crater,
monsieur.
The observatory at Papeete must know if there is one vent or many...
...from which the lava is flowing.
- Fly over it?
As low in and as close as you can get.
I'm a pilot, not a hero.
I fought my war.
My wife has no use in bed for a cinder.
If you fail, I'll see that you get posthumous awards.
Thanks.
The telephone line to the hospital is down.
- What did you expect?
- Repair it. I've got to talk to them...
...find out what's happening.
- I've already had a crew out.
The damage is halfway up the mountain.
- It can't be repaired.
- It's gotta be repaired!
I must talk to them some way or get up there.
Then walk. I suggest that you and your new curate...
Father Perreau has had an accident.
His leg is broken. I put it in a splint.
I am sorry to hear it. I have problems more important than broken legs.
I do not require aerial photographs.
Your personal observations will do.
- You will fly...
- You flying over the mountain?
Take me with you.
Father Doonan, I have been tolerant of these interruptions!
The hospital is finished! If they've not already been blown into the sky...
...they were in the path of the lava flow.
- No human could have survived.
- No! You don't know that for sure yet!
I'm going with you. You have to pass the hospital to get to the crater.
Then I can see with my eyes what I have to see.
Well...
You want miracles, mon père, you should be in church.
Take him with you.
But your primary mission is to bring back information on the crater.
And remember, you are under military orders.
Yes. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
Where are you going?
Why, you're heading to sea!
You're clearing out!
For a priest, you certainly haven't got much faith in your fellow man.
I'm heading out over the ocean to gain altitude.
Okay. Here we go.
Keep your eyes open.
There's the lava flow.
Three streams.
We are getting out of here.
You mean you're going toward the hospital.
You saw what it was like on the other side.
There's no hope for them, Father.
You gave me your word!
All right. There'll be too much smoke to see anything.
We'll probably choke to death, but all right.
That peak is right next to the lava flow.
The buildings could never have stood the shock...
...let alone human beings.
I saw it! I saw it! It's there!
I saw the top of the main building.
It's there.
You wanted to see it, Father.
Did you see anything?
Believe me!
I tell you it's there! I saw it!
They're still alive!
Now, look, you've got a parachute.
Drop me. I've got to get to them.
You've got to go back.
Those children, they're still alive!
You cowards!
You're taking me back!
You're going to drop me, I tell you.
You maniac!
There are three streams of lava.
Here, here and here:
As for the volcano, we got in as close as we could.
We are lucky to be back alive.
The red-hot rocks hit the fuselage like ack-ack.
All right.
Go on, go on, go on.
At first, it looked like one fountain gushing.
Closer, we could see more vents.
Several more opening up under the pressure.
There's not a sign it's slackening off.
I'm no expert, but ask me, the whole island could go up.
I haven't asked you.
- You see the hospital?
- I saw nothing.
Neither did Paul.
- But Father Doonan...
- Thinks he saw it, eh?
- Yes, sir.
- Maybe he did see something.
There was a lot of smoke.
He saw nothing.
The man is an idiot.
We almost had it with him.
He went mad when we refused to parachute him into the mountain.
- Where is he now?
- In church, where he belongs.
Not in an aeroplane.
We're leaving.
We have to manage with what we have.
The schooner, your plane.
- Haven't you reached the freighter?
- No.
Come.
It is no longer safe to stay.
Even they know.
I've got to get up there.
- You will.
- How? Crawl?
Or a miracle maybe?
We have to believe in miracles, Father, before we dare ask for one.
That reminds me, did you make our reservations?
The bridal suite, what else?
Hot- and cold-running brides.
Okay, general, sir.
Silence! Silence!
I commend your behaviour, your lack of panic.
We will continue with this same calm and order.
There is no immediate danger.
Our only problem is the lava flow coming down the ravines.
But lava moves at a predictable speed.
We, therefore, have time in which to evacuate the island.
I must also tell you now, because our radio-telephone tower has fallen...
...we have not been able to contact the freighter which left yesterday morning.
But we have
Captain Olsen's schooner.
And we have a seaplane.
It is sufficient.
I would also remind you, you are all under martial law!
- Martial law?
- For your information...
Man, give them a uniform, they all turn into cops.
- Now and again authority is necessary.
- Yeah? Like when?
Women and children will enplane first.
Grellou, my clerk here, will tell you how much baggage you can take.
Do not argue with him.
Space is valuable.
Space is life!
The freighter!
- The freighter?
- The freighter!
The marines. Just in time.
The freighter is coming.
You won't need the plane.
Will you fly me to the hospital?
Will you parachute me down?
- Will you give up this insane idea?
- You must permit this! You must!
There are children there, alive, waiting for someone.
- You said you saw nothing.
- That's right, nothing.
- That's not true. I tell you, I saw it.
- I'm sorry, Father.
Is there a possibility that you are wrong?
- I admit visibility was bad. Very bad.
- There, you see? He's not sure.
Neither is he.
How can you possibly object to it?
All I'm asking you to do is to parachute me down.
I must object.
I'm responsible for your life.
Yours as well as all these.
I'm a priest.
I absolve you of all responsibility.
If they are alive, these children, some of them bedridden, what could you do?
How could you get them down?
It's impossible.
I could get help.
I'll get men to help me.
- You said yourself there was time.
- What men could you get?
- Those busy getting their families out?
- Yes. I'll get some of them.
This I believe. Look, look, if I get the volunteers, will you give me the plane?
- Will you fly us?
- Father Doonan, listen to me.
We don't have time.
I don't know how many hours we have before the island blows up.
I have said what I have to say to keep everybody calm.
I don't believe those children are alive, but you do.
I'm not a murderer. Therefore, you have my permission to go up to the hospital.
And you can have the plane, if...
A big "if."
- if you can get volunteers to go with you.
Now, listen.
Listen to me, everybody.
The hospital.
Those at the hospital need help.
There's room for everybody on the freighter.
The governor has given me permission...
...to ask for volunteers to the mountain with me.
Now, come on.
There are helpless children up there.
You with children will understand they've got to be helped.
Man, that's bad.
I forgot about those kids.
He wastes his time pleading with these peasants.
Could you turn your back on them?
You know you couldn't.
Please, I beg of you.
If you turn away, all your lives you'll torture yourselves...
...with the awful memory of what you've done.
How are you going to feel if you sail away leaving helpless children behind?
Somebody, help me!
Anybody! Please!
I have a wife and two daughters, so you have no business demanding this.
- Parachute.
- They are lepers.
Dead by now and better off dead.
A priest should think of the living.
How about us going?
Are you mad?
Why?
- Parachute?
- It's easy.
I could show you how.
I jumped in Korea.
You want to help that priest?
He's crazy!
- I'm not thinking about the priest.
- All right. A bunch of sick kids.
I'm not thinking about the priest or the sick kids, Marcel.
I'm thinking about him.
No, pushing, please.
There is time.
Now, maybe, just maybe, we could get time off of the jail sentence if we went.
No, no, no.
I'm not jumping off aeroplanes.
I would rather the Tahiti jail.
Rats, cockroaches, everything.
Look, Marcel, you really wanna retire to a stone room...
...cooped up for eight years with no women?
Please, don't talk like that.
We're not in prison yet.
We will be.
Listen to Harry, man, because crying ain't gonna melt the bars away.
How about it, Marcel?
What do you say, Butcher?
No, you go. You two.
I could never jump. Never.
We all go together or none of us go.
Forget it. It was an idea.
- Come on. Nobody will miss us.
- Where we going?
- We're going.
- Where?
Where? There's loot all over the place, Marcel.
What good to us?
We're going to jail.
You'd be surprised how cool jail can be when you got loot for the jailer.
Attaboy, Charlie. Come on.
Cheers.
Goodbye, Talua!
Next stop, Tahiti!
Why you look at the church?
- The shops are there.
- Yeah, but in that church is a poor box.
Yeah. We can jimmy it open.
The Lord helps those who help themselves.
Hallelujah.
Wait!
We just dropped in for a quick prayer.
No. No. You're going up the mountain with me.
- You came to volunteer, didn't you?
- You're crazy.
Get your noble citizens to go.
No, they have problems.
They have responsibilities.
We got them too. We got an appointment in Tahiti, eight long years.
I can help you.
I can talk to the governor.
I can talk to the governor-general of all the islands.
I know him, you know?
He's in Tahiti...
...and I could get him to commute your sentence.
But it's madness.
You're all mad. They are fried up there!
No. We don't know that for sure yet!
- You know this big man in Tahiti?
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.
- You know him well?
- Oh, I know him well.
And he's a good man.
He'll listen to me.
We gotta have us a conference.
Excuse us.
Oh, God, forgive me...
...for ever having doubted you.
Oh, please, let them come.
I have my volunteers.
- You're taking them? Them?
- Yes, sir.
- It's impossible. I cannot allow it.
- Why not?
I'd have to hold the freighter in the harbour too long.
If you made it to the mountain, and you can't...
I know I can, okay? Hold the freighter.
You gave me your word.
Wait a moment. I've seen some stubborn jackasses in my day...
...but nothing like you.
I know one when I see one because they've been calling me one for years.
If you and these characters are brave enough to go after those children...
...l'm willing to wait for you with my schooner.
I'll wait till 4:00 tomorrow afternoon.
No longer.
- Four o'clock. We'll be here.
- I cannot wait a minute longer.
We must sail.
At 4:00 the tide goes out.
Now remember it's nothing.
Just don't freeze.
When you jump out, count 10 and pull that ring. You'll soar like a bird.
Harry, what if it doesn't open?
When you hit the ground, tell me about it and I'll fix it for you.
You. Soon as you touch the ground, start rolling toward your side.
Let your knees go limp, see?
Roll immediately. And relax.
Remember to relax.
- Relax, he says.
- And pray.
No, you stay relaxed, let him pray.
I'm coming along the face of the mountain.
Find me your hospital if it's still there.
It's there all right.
I'll watch for it, then I'll yell.
Now, remember you got lines on these things.
You can pull them the way you wanna drift...
...spills the air out of the shrouds.
We have shrouds already.
There it is!
Now. Right below us.
I see it! Get ready!
I'll make another run in.
I knew it was there.
Be sure you come in nice and high.
Give us plenty of sky to open up in.
One. Two. Three. Four.
You jump when I call your number.
And don't stall.
Go, one!
Two!
Three!
Four!
- Are you all right?
- A little shaken up.
It's the first time I've done this in a long time.
- Have you seen the others?
- No.
Well, let's find them.
Charlie! Marcel!
Hey! Over here!
- Keep yelling!
- This way, Harry!
Hey! Coming over!
- You did not bring my magazine.
- No.
No, not this time, Marguerite.
It slipped my mind.
- Attaboy, Charlie. You all right?
- Man, I liked it.
- What a ride.
- Is the Butcher with you?
He fainted Harry, soon as I pushed him out.
Marcel!
Hey, Butcher!
All right. Down he goes.
Okay, drop.
All right. All right.
Come on. Okay, okay.
Cut it out!
Come on.
You didn't die, you're all right.
The devil's not ready for you yet.
I thought I was going right into the volcano.
Grease on the griddle.
The old boy's waiting to cook something special out of you.
Come on, let's get to those kids.
Go on. Get going.
Marcel, hold the children in the baskets.
You hold them.
I'll hold the donkey.
All right, let's go.
I don't catch anything from them?
No.
- How dare you.
- I was helping. You would have fallen.
No more of your help.
I can manage.
I'm a Frenchman, chérie.
No Frenchman can resist your charms.
There's lava here too!
- Up and over?
- It's our only chance.
- And fast.
- Charlie, grab a line.
Get up there, right away.
Come on, kids. Move!
Come on. Move it!
All right up here!
Start them climbing.
Here. Just hold onto me.
Come on, fast. That's it.
Hang on.
Come on, get up.
I'll get the kid.
Go ahead, Antoine.
No! Don't touch me!
All right.
Too late. I got it now.
All right, kids. Come on.
Mon père, it will be dark soon and the children are tired.
- Can't we rest for the night?
- All right, Marguerite.
Am I getting heavy?
I'll tell you when, then you can carry me.
We're a combination, eh?
We're going to win the Gold Cup at Longchamps.
- Will that make us rich?
- Rich?
And famous! Just keep me on the rail till you see the stretch...
...then we sprint and we win.
Hey, hey, what about the branch there?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Pay attention.
You want to be a good jockey, no?
A fleur for Fleur.
Thank you, Harry.
Okay, everybody, let's break.
Take a little rest now.
I think something's wrong.
Wexler.
Hey, doc!
She's dead.
Well, what did I do?
Nothing.
She just wasn't strong enough.
Take the children on up ahead.
Wait for us.
Come on, children. Come on.
Yeah, but what did I do?
You didn't do anything.
You did all you could, Harry.
I just talked to her a little while ago back there.
It wasn't just the disease.
She was always frail.
Her little heart just wouldn't hold up any longer.
It was all too much for her.
Come on, Harry.
The kid's dead.
And you are alive.
I'm alive. So what?
May her soul...
...and all the souls of the faithful departed rest in peace.
In the name of the Father and of the Son...
...and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Hold it!
The wind's bringing it toward us.
We've got to find some shelter.
There should be some caves up there to the right.
You want us to sit in caves and wait?
But we cannot wait, the schooner will be gone.
We've got three hours yet.
We'll make it.
I'm for going back a way, and then up and over the gorge.
- We're going forward.
- Who says? You?
That's right.
I don't know what to do.
I sure don't wanna miss that schooner.
Listen, I'm a Frenchman, we made democracy. I say put it to a vote.
I'll buy that. There are five of us.
All right.
Who says we go forward?
Three to two.
We find the caves.
While we sit in caves, who puts out the fire?
Well, with luck we'll have rain.
Rain? How, you going to make it?
Sure. Him and Charlie gonna make miracles on their knees.
All right, everybody, let's get to the caves.
Where is Camille?
She is with him?
With Harry in that other cave, isn't she?
Let them alone, will you?
Why don't you make us some rain?
It will rain.
Father Doonan says so.
Father Doonan, Father Doonan.
He's crazy, that one, in the head.
- Charlie. Charlie, I just thought...
- What?
The bridge! It's burning too, it won't be there.
Easy, man. Easy.
- The bridge will be there.
- No.
We're trapped!
We're all going to die.
Then die quiet, please.
Doctor. Monsieur Doctor.
I want to ask, if we ever get out of this...
...will I end up in a hospital for leprosy?
- Will I go to hospital?
- No. Stop worrying.
- You could be lying.
- I'm not.
It's one thing to get our sentences reduced.
What good is it if we are sent to a leper colony instead?
You fool.
None of these children are contagious.
We have sent hundreds of them back to their families...
...from our own little hospital, cured.
- That right, lady?
- Ask the doctor. Ask Father Doonan.
All of these children, one day will go home.
If they get out of this alive.
Do you think we'll get out of this alive, any of us?
No.
That's honest.
Now I believe what you say about leprosy.
Where's your miracle?
- Where's the rain?
- I prayed.
Then pray some more, you priest.
You're no good.
You're an incompetent.
I'm making a complaint against you...
...to God.
Yeah, man.
You could lose your license.
You have seen Camille?
She's all right now.
She's with Harry.
Alone with him?
They're married now.
Married?
To him?
- You did that?
- I did.
My little Camille, married to that pig!
No, no, no, now.
He could be safe now on a boat on his way to Tahiti...
...but he chose to be here with us...
...sitting on the edge of an oven.
That makes him a man.
And it makes him our friend.
More important than Harry or Camille...
...is that schooner.
Is it gonna wait for us?
Harry?
Did you mean it?
What you said?
Of course I meant it.
I said it, didn't I?
In front of him even.
I never said that before in my life.
I thee wed.
Say it again, Harry.
I thee wed.
You know, I was just thinking.
If we get out of this...
And I said "if."
I know a guy...
...he's a manager of a plantation in Fiji.
I bet you he'd give me a job.
But you have to go to prison first.
Well, Holy Joe said maybe.
Maybe he can do something for me.
Oh, Harry.
You hear that?
Sounds like rain.
Can you hear it?
It's pouring.
Chérie, what is your first name?
- Marguerite.
- Marguerite.
I like it.
Help!
- Help!
- Stop!
Help! Stop!
- Help!
- Take the child!
Here you go.
You all right?
I'm sinking!
I'm sinking!
In the name of God, somebody help me!
Harry! Harry!
- Hang on, Butcher!
- Harry!
- Harry, come on! Harry!
- Hang on, Butcher. Hang on.
Harry! Harry!
Harry! Harry!
For the love of God! Harry!
God! God, forgive me!
Harry, Marcel prayed.
Did you hear him?
- What good did it do him?
- I don't know, but he prayed.
Doonan got you believing that God stuff too?
Not yet, but I think I believe in him,
Harry, in Father Doonan.
Yeah? Why?
Because he takes responsibility.
He behaves the way
God ought to behave.
The bridge. It's still there.
Hold it! Hold it!
- I'll go with you.
- No, me first.
- Hey, Mr. Priest.
- Yeah?
You think we can brace it?
- Well, we can sure try, sonny.
- Like I said, the name's Charlie.
All right. It's as safe as a bank.
Come on.
Come on, now.
Hold on to the rope.
Keep moving down there!
That's right. Go on.
Don't be scared.
Just don't look down.
Just keep moving.
Don't look down.
Good.
Easy.
Now, if this thing shakes, don't be scared.
All right, you guys! Everybody's across! Come on out of there!!
Out of my way, man.
- Charlie!
- Go on.
I said get going!
Charlie...
...so long.
Go on.
All right, let's go.
And leave them?
Leave Father Doonan?
He cut the cards.
He knew what he was doing.
We got a boat to catch.
Come on. Come on, move.
Come on.
- Help her.
- Come on, get her out of there.
Harry.
Harry.
Harry made it.
They all made it.
They're all across.
They can't come back.
And you did it, fella.
You gave them time to get across.
The name's Charlie.
Camille, the boat's here.
You'll be on it in a couple of minutes.
I'm not going with you.
- Harry.
- I'm going back, baby.
I've got to, they're alone there.
Take care of her for me, will you?
Be good and be happy.
- Where are you going?
- Back.
Back there?
But there's not anything you can do.
- That isn't the point, is it?
- You fool.
What is the point?
What good can you do?
You will miss the boat.
Lady...
...I missed the boat a long time ago.
Stop him! Please!
No. Let him go.
Don't be afraid of God.
Call on him if you want to.
Don't you guys ever give up?
Sure we do.
Priests are human.
We fail just like anybody else.
I know I gave up.
I stopped speaking to God for a long time.
That's when you and Marcel and Harry came along.
I had lost my faith in God.
You fellas gave it back to me.
This heaven and hell stuff...
...you mean there's something to it?
Well, there better be.
I've been selling it half my life.
I wasn't buying.
Well, you had company.
Lots of people can't buy it.
I was busy.
I was a pretty good thief in my time.
I could believe that.
It's too late.
Can't chicken out now.
Never too late to change.
My old lady, my mother, that's what she used to say.
Never too late.
She was right.
She kept after me...
...kept telling me there was another thief once...
...dying on a cross...
...right next to Christ.
The good thief.
That's what she called him.
He didn't chicken out.
He just got smart.
And at the very last moment, he stole heaven.
That's pretty good stealing, huh?
Pretty good stealing, son.
- Hey, Charlie!
- Harry?
Charlie.
- It's me, Charlie. Harry boy.
- What are you doing here?
Relax, Pops. They're on the boat nice and safe, all of them.
Get out of here! Go on back!
- You still have the truck.
- Leave him be.
Harry, man...
...come back to keep us company.
Harry...
Charlie?
O Lord...
...receive this, the soul of thy servant...
...whose name was Charlie.
Rest in peace.
In the name of the Father and of the Son...
...and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
He was a good boy.
That he was.
Just you and me now, Pops.
- That's right.
- New Jersey and New York.
It's awful quiet.
Winding up for the big one.
Yeah.
See you around, Pops.
I'll see you.
In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
Don't tell me you forgot how to do that.
O my God...
...we...
We are most heartily sorry for having offended thee.
And we detest all of our sins...
...because we dread the loss of heaven and the pains of hell.
But most of all...
...because they offend thee, my God, who art all good...
...and deserving of all our love.
The drivers are all on the grid now, and
the Monaco Grand Prix is about to start.
There's Scott Stoddard
with his Jordan BRM.
And with him now, is Jeff Jordan himself,
talking to this brilliant English driver...
... who's won so many races
in the dark-green BRMs.
Even faster than Stoddard in practice,
was the Frenchman, Jean-Pierre Sarti.
Twice world champion, an absolute master
of these twisting Monte Carlo streets...
... he's won the Grand Prix here
three times.
He drives for the great Italian manufacturer,
Ferrari.
His teammate is the Sicilian, Nino Barlini,
who's also won a place on the front row.
Barlini's the former world champion
motorcyclist...
... who made a very successful switch
to car racing last year...
... and is certainly a potential
world champion in Formula 1 racing.
On the second row, is Pete Aron,
the American, now driving for BRM.
Pete hasn't won a Grand Prix since
he left Ferrari three seasons ago.
But in spite of two bad accidents last year,
he's still just as fast as ever.
Yesterday he lapped only a tenth slower
than Scott Stoddard...
... number one driver in the BRM team.
Let's try and get the season off to a good start. Shall we?
Drive the car, don't try to stand it on its bloody ear.
Tim Randolph, another American, driving
a Japanese Yamura, also on the second row.
This team's only been in Formula 1 racing
for two years...
... and so far the car's not been
reliable enough to win a Grand Prix.
But the Japanese have
the most powerful engines of all.
Ten seconds.
Five...
...four...
...three...
...two, one.
Go!
Ste. Devote,
then Sarti in the lead.
From Stoddard, Aron, Hulme,
Anderson and Randolph.
Stoddard's drawing level with Sarti
up the hill. He's going to overtake him.
Now, it's Sarti in the red Ferrari,
number 17 leading...
... past the Hotel de Paris
and into the Casino Square.
Along the seafront, at the tobacconist...
... it's Sarti's red Ferrari ahead of
Stoddard's green BRM number 12.
As they finish the first lap, it's Sarti first,
Stoddard second, Aron third...
... and fourth now
is Barlini's Ferrari, number 16.
I used to think nothing
could be better than motorbike racing.
Three times I'm awarded champion
on my motorbike. I'm happy.
Then I go into one of these...
These cars... You sit in a box, a coffin.
Gasoline all around you.
It is like being inside a bomb.
Crazy.
But, of course, the cars are faster.
And that is the most important thing.
You have to remember that at Monte Carlo,
because of the nature of the circuit...
...you shift gears over 2600 times
during the race.
That's an average of once
every three seconds.
No reason to expect gearbox trouble.
On the other hand, potential problems
are in the back of your mind all the time.
I've driven this course six times before...
...the way I see it, I've only got three big problems today, and that's:
Two Ferraris starting ahead of me and my own teammate, Scott Stoddard.
Walking the course is just about the last
thing I'd do on the morning of a race.
It's become a bit of a thing with me.
I do a lot of thinking...
... collecting my thoughts about how I'll
run the race, all that sort of thing.
Of course, it originated with my brother,
Roger. He used to do the same thing.
As a matter of fact, before I started racing
I often used walk the course with him.
The funny thing about Roger,
you know...
...the day he was killed, he hadn't walked
the circuit for some reason or another.
I suppose I'm rather superstitious
about that.
I love the challenge of Monaco.
Driving through ordinary streets full out,
is to me what racing is all about.
It's a pity it's the only one
left of its kind.
At the end of 10 laps the order is still
Sarti, Stoddard, Aron and Barlini.
Stoddard can't quite squeeze his BRM
past Sarti's Ferrari.
There's very little room to pass
on these narrow Monte Carlo streets.
Barlini and the other Ferraris
can't quite...
- Oh, my darling. You're not ready?
- Ready? For what?
Pat, you've forgotten.
Hugo, the way I feel now...
...if I could remember my own name,
I'd consider myself very fortunate.
- What have I forgotten?
- Last night.
I told you I'd be by to take you to the winner's circle...
...if Scott wins.
- Hugo, there's lots of time.
The dungarees.
Hugo, have you ever had ouzo?
I have had everything, my dear.
I was with two Greeks last night and we drank ouzo. A lot of ouzo.
And where, may I ask, was your husband...
...while all this Greek and ouzo business was going on?
Where he always is the night before a race:
Trying to sleep.
The danger? Well, of course.
But you are missing
a very important point.
I think, if any of us imagined,
really imagined...
...what it would be like to go into a tree
at 150 miles an hour...
...we would probably never get
into the cars at all. None of us.
So it has always seemed to me,
that to do something very dangerous...
...requires a certain
absence of imagination.
Number 17, the Ferrari of Jean-Pierre Sarti,
is still in front...
... but he just cannot get away from
number 12, Scott Stoddard in the BRM.
And the second BRM driver, number 11,
Pete Aron, is only three seconds behind...
... with Nino Barlini in number 16
Ferrari breathing down his neck.
That's 25 laps gone.
One-quarter of the race distance.
As Sarti and Stoddard fight for the lead,
they're leaving Aron and Barlini behind.
Stoddard's pressing Sarti. The Frenchman's
usually unbeatable at Monaco...
... but today the Englishman is faster
on some parts of the circuit.
Now that Stoddard's out in the lead,
his lap times are faster and faster.
And he's going steadily away from Sarti.
There doesn't seem to be anything
the Ferrari driver can do about it.
There's Scott Stoddard completing his
30th lap and increasing his lead over Sarti.
But there's the third man, Barlini,
in his red Ferrari now well-clear of Aron.
And he's just lapping a slower car.
That can be tricky here at Monte Carlo.
It's almost impossible to pass...
... unless you can rely on the driver in the
slower car to move over and make room.
That's 32 laps completed and the order is
Stoddard, Sarti, Barlini, Randolph, Aron.
- Get back out there.
- It's sticking in between third and fourth.
It didn't do it in practice.
Do you suppose it could be you?
All right, I'm doing it on purpose.
On purpose or not, you're breaking her up.
- I didn't build the damn car.
- We can't do anything about it.
- Do the best you can.
- What lap is this?
- Forty-two.
- It's a cinch. I'm halfway home.
You're never halfway home!
Pete Aron's away again.
He's had some sort of gearbox trouble.
There's Stoddard now. He'll lap
his BRM teammate, Aron, next time round.
Stoddard's driving a tremendous race.
Bet he's broken the lap record again: 129.3.
Blimey, they nearly collided
at the Gasometer hairpin. That was close.
Louis Chiron's waving
the blue flag at the American...
... which means he ought to move over
and let the faster car through.
Let Scott through!
The bloody idiot.
Sarti's picked up three seconds.
You can't blame Pete for wanting to race.
Not with a teammate!
He has to let him through!
Barlini in second place at the Gasometer
as Sarti completes 50 laps...
...half distance in the lead.
- That's my driver. Let go. Let me through.
- Damn you! Damn you!
- Get these people out of here!
- I waved him through.
- Where are the cops?
- You're a bloody liar.
- Please, Jeff.
I told you to take it easy with him.
- Apart from being a bloody coward!
- Jeff, don't.
- Shut up! You're a liar!
- Now, get these people out of here!
Shut up.
Look, you're through with me!
Now, just get out of my sight as quick as you can!
Something's happened.
There has been an accident.
That's what they come for:
See someone get killed.
- How did it happen?
- A bloody lot you care.
- Don't say that. Don't speak to me like...
- Mrs. Stoddard.
You can stay here if you want.
It will be some time in surgery.
You've got what you want now.
He's finished with driving.
Maybe we'll have some peace in our lives now.
You think so?
How I didn't spin out is a miracle of skill and daring.
What do you think of this man?
In the middle of the race he decided to take a swim.
It cost me two seconds.
From the manager.
Hey, Jean-Pierre.
You should fix that.
I have something in my room.
I just talked to the hospital.
- He's alive?
- Yeah.
Jordan says I was blocking.
Said I didn't give him a signal to pass.
- Did you?
- Of course I did.
The gearbox froze coming out of the tunnel and I waved him through.
Got on the brakes, locked up, and threw me in front of him.
Next thing I knew,
I was in the Mediterranean.
What are you going to do now?
I don't know. Gotta get a ride for the rest of the season. I don't know where.
Pete?
Do you ever get tired?
Of the driving?
No.
Lately, I sometimes get very tired.
You know what I mean?
Very tired.
All right, unhook it.
Jeff is wrong, isn't he, Scott?
He says you're finished.
But you're not finished, are you?
I know, Scott.
Better than Jeff, better than anyone.
If I told them you'd drive again, they'd think I was crazy.
They'll think you're crazy when you tell them.
But you will, won't you, Scott?
You're in pieces now, but it won't change anything for you.
You'll pull yourself together and get back in the car somehow.
And for what?
To be better than Roger.
To compete against a dead man.
They don't know anything about that, do they, Scott?
Not like I know.
They don't know it wasn't Pete Aron in that car today...
...it was Roger you were trying to beat.
Roger's in every car you try to pass.
Well...
...this time, I'm the one that's finished.
No more for me, Scott.
I won't be there next time.
No more for me.
Please.
- Madame. Madame.
- Let me through.
Will he drive again?
Leave it.
Come on, will he be flown back to London?
Leave it.
I don't need your help.
You bastard.
- Agreement. Really.
- Yes, sir.
Then we can accuse Aron of being ungentlemanly.
But not of breaking the rules.
- Oh, excuse me.
- I still don't agree.
At last. I began to think you were not coming.
I'm afraid I got lost.
You need only have followed the crowd.
I wish I had known.
I've only myself to blame.
I invited them all.
First, a drink.
And then I will introduce you to some people who will be able to help you.
Of course, you must tell me more about the sort of things you'll be doing.
All in a day's work, Hugo.
This is work, huh?
It looks so easy.
I'd like you to meet
Miss Louise Frederickson.
This is Jean-Pierre Sarti.
Jean-Pierre, it was a wonderful race.
Fantastic.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
She...
She's an American journalist, so be careful what you say, huh?
Would you believe it?
Once, a boy off the streets...
...and now he speaks to kings.
Anyone can speak to kings, Hugo.
But will they speak back?
But if they do, what will they say?
Oh, you see must see my museum.
- Something that might interest you.
- Museum?
- Yes. It's a...
- Jean-Pierre?
- Marvelous, Jean-Pierre.
- Thank you.
- Simply marvelous.
- Thank you.
Your first nine. Hugo, you've got to come to settle an argument...
...about the 1932 Targa Florio.
He's the only one old enough to have been there.
Now, there is a dubious distinction.
Was an excellent race you did today.
Well done.
- Thank you, Bob. Thank you very much.
- Very good.
Suppose I show you the museum?
Obviously, if I don't escape from here, we'll never get past "hello."
Come to think of it, we haven't even managed that yet.
Now...
...hello.
- Hello.
- What did she mean, "your first nine"?
- Points.
Toward the Drivers' World Championship.
Have you known Hugo very long?
Since yesterday.
Someone in New York gave me his name.
He's offered me his influence.
Which I gather is quite extensive.
Influence? For what?
Well, I work for an
American fashion magazine.
We're going to do an issue around racing cars.
Yes! Now, I have it.
Of course.
Louise Frederickson.
You once did an article about my wife,
Monique Delvaux.
"One of the 27 best-dressed business women in the world."
Something like that.
Only 10.
You were away at the time, as I recall.
Yes. "While..."
"While her husband is off racing motor cars...
...this busy woman executive spends long evenings in her office...
...administering the complex affairs of the Delvaux Motor Company."
I remember that part quite well.
It had about it the slight hint of feminine prejudice...
...toward the footloose male.
It wasn't meant to sound that way.
Is your wife here tonight?
She never comes to the races.
Charming, isn't it?
I can use this.
It's interesting.
Do you like motor racing?
I don't know.
I had never seen a race before today.
- What are these?
- Autographs.
People in motor racing.
Where are you?
Over there somewhere.
Are you going to the palace party tonight?
I wasn't invited.
I invite you.
There are a lot of parties tonight, aren't there?
Yes.
- Is that the usual thing after a race?
- Of course.
And I can assure you...
...that if you don't come to the palace party tonight with me...
...you will be missed.
And this man Stoddard, will he be missed too?
I don't understand.
- Do you know Stoddard?
- No.
But I find it difficult to understand how this sort of thing can be going on.
The celebrations.
When a man lies in a hospital, possibly crippled for life.
If he were dead, it would be the same.
More subdued perhaps, but the same.
And apparently it doesn't affect you at all. None of you.
I'm sorry.
I guess that was all very rude of me.
Before you leave,
I want to tell you something.
Not about the others.
But about myself.
I used to go to pieces.
I'd see an accident like that and feel so weak inside...
...that I wanted to quit.
To stop the car and walk away.
I could hardly make myself go past it.
But I'm older now.
When I see something really horrible,
I put my foot down.
Hard.
Because I know that everyone else is lifting his.
What a terrible way to win.
No, there is no terrible way to win.
There is only winning.
Hello, Nino.
Nino!
Nino!
Dance?
I don't dance.
Have a drink with me.
I don't drink.
- Smoke?
- I don't smoke.
What do you do?
So you let Stoddard lap you.
You're still getting yourself into hopeless situations.
It wasn't hopeless to begin with, it just turned out that way.
There's a difference.
But you didn't come all the way to Modena, to talk about Scott Stoddard. Did you?
I wanna drive for you again,
Signor Manetta.
Aron, your last season with me...
...you did nothing but tell me what was wrong with our cars.
Then you left us, to follow hopes that lasted a season.
Then to Jordan, now back to me.
You confuse me, Aron.
And I don't like men who confuse me driving my cars.
I left you because I didn't want to become second driver to Sarti.
A position you put me in.
And now?
I need a ride.
I won a lot of races for you.
Of course you did.
Before you became reckless.
- I want to be champion.
- Everyone wants to be a champion, Aron.
There is no distinction in that.
I can be.
At what cost? And to whom?
All right.
I'll drive for you for less than
I was getting on my old contract.
I'll pay my own expenses.
You take the starting money.
I'll just take my share of the prizes.
I'm not talking about money, Aron.
Of course, I would not appreciate your doing to me...
...what you did to Jordan at Monaco.
To have two cars wiped out, at a cost of $ 100,000 apiece...
...is an unhappy experience.
But I could afford that.
I could not be in this business if I weren't able to afford that.
It's one of the risks I take every time a car leaves the starting grid.
But what is a greater risk, Aron...
...what means far more to me than anything else is a good name.
Our reputation represents desire for perfection of the highest quality.
I gamble that reputation gladly.
Because I have absolute faith in every car...
...that leaves this factory.
But I will not risk it in a driver...
...in whom I cannot have an equal faith.
There are fewer than 30 men in the world, qualified to drive Formula 1.
A mere half-dozen, perhaps, to win.
At this moment, I'm inclined to think you're not one of them.
Tough luck, Scott.
- Hello. How are you? All right?
- Jeff, how are you?
Is it true that doctors strongly advise against moving Scott?
No, the decision to come home was Scott's.
He felt with English doctors he'd probably...
What about next season?
Scott, will you be ready to drive?
He's ready to drive now.
I just don't happen to have a car for him at the moment.
All right, let's get him in.
- Hey, Jeff.
- Yeah?
What about these rumors of a divorce between Scott and Pat?
- Absolute nonsense.
- I know, but we've heard...
Now, look, Mrs. Stoddard is taking an enforced vacation under doctor's orders.
You know neither heaven nor earth could keep her from Scott's side.
- She's just on this holiday.
- All right.
- Okay. Thanks.
- Good luck.
- Where is she?
- Forget her.
- Where is she, Jeff?
- I don't know.
I want her back, you know.
You're a fool, then.
Jeff, you've never understood her.
I know you think she's frivolous, incapable of any kind of understanding.
But you're wrong.
It's just that she hates what I do.
I think she still loves me, you know.
Hard as that may be for you to understand.
Trouble is, she's got to persuade herself that she doesn't.
I worry about what she might do...
...trying to convince herself of that.
- Fine. Thank you, David. Where's Tina?
- Tina! Tina!
Tina?
Hey, Pat? In the car.
- How am I doing?
- You're doing beautifully.
- I look all right?
- You look fine. Now, just stop worrying.
- Oh, good morning.
- Good morning.
I expected you to be back in America by now.
Oh, no. We'll be doing this the entire season. I thought you knew.
No, no.
Does Guido know about all this?
Of course.
Arrangements were made.
Well, I can't say I'm not properly dressed for the occasion.
I should be wearing something fashionable.
Well, your driver's suit isn't bad.
Maybe you could start a new style.
Spun-glass, form-fitting, waterproof, flameproof.
What's Pat doing here?
Oh, she asked for a job and I was able to give her one.
She's very good.
- Hello, Pat.
- Hello, Jean-Pierre.
You're looking very chic in my car.
- How's Scott?
- I don't know.
- Arrangements were made.
- They told me arrangements were made.
Guido.
They mean no harm.
So far, Sarti has
the fastest practice time.
If nobody goes any faster this afternoon,
the Ferrari will be in pole position...
... for tomorrow's French Grand Prix.
Sarti's time was 3 minutes,
11. 1 seconds.
95. 1 miles an hour.
This Clermont Ferrand circuit is just...
- How do you feel?
- Like an idiot.
Don't look so glum.
It's an honorable profession.
- You'd rather be dogcatcher or something?
- Or something.
- He's doing well.
- He could do better.
A slave driver, this one.
This looks very complicated.
At first glance.
It's only a different way to tell time.
More precise.
Well, I'm afraid I don't understand any of this.
- Not any of it?
- No.
I mean, for one thing, it looks to me as though the spectators...
...can't really see very much of the race.
True enough, I suppose.
Jean-Pierre, andiamo!
And the risks you take.
Aren't they ridiculous?
I might understand it if you made a great deal of money...
...but I'm told you don't at all.
Some of us do. But money is not an important part of it.
- Then what is?
- Many things.
It's marvelous to go very fast.
Why is it so marvelous to go very fast?
Answer that one, Lisa.
- Hello, Chris.
- Hi, Pete.
- Jean-Pierre. How are you?
- Hey!
- How are you, Pete?
- All right.
Hey, Nino.
The cars aren't good enough for him anymore.
Interview me first, Pete.
I have had a fascinating life.
- I might as well.
- World should know.
I wouldn't want people to think I was unemployed.
I was a born a poor boy in Cerda, Sicily. Nothing to eat.
- Not a crumb of bread in the house.
- I guess Manetta told you...
...I came looking for a job.
- Every year, I would...
Well, I think he should've found you one.
Cerda is right on the course of the great Targa Florio race.
- Knock it off, will you?
- Knock it off? What's that?
It means: You would be well-advised to cease.
Yes.
"Knock it off."
I like that.
We're pleased to announce the arrival...
... of the famous Japanese industrialist,
Mr. Izo Yamura.
He's been racing Formula 1 cars
for more than two years now.
But this is his first visit
to a Grand Prix circuit.
We're delighted to welcome him
to Clermont Ferrand.
This might be something to get, Pete.
Well, you care to come watch my debut?
- Hello, Tim.
- Hello, Pete.
- Hello again.
- Pete, how are you?
Mr. Yamura? My name is Pete Aron.
Mr. Yamura wishes you to know that he, of course, recognizes from photographs...
...the well-known Mr. Aron.
Although he was at first somewhat confused...
...to find you in your present occupation.
He also offers his regrets in regard to your unfortunate accident at Monaco.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.
I was wondering if Mr. Yamura would consent to doing an interview?
Mr. Yamura regrets he does not give interviews.
Well, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you very much, sir.
- See you, Tim.
- See you later, Pete.
Well, I'm off to a flying start.
- Well, there's always Nino.
- Yeah. There's always Nino.
He was born in Cerda, Sicily, you know.
Not a crumb of bread in the house.
But he always knew that someday, someday a poor guy, you know.
Of course there's no trouble
between Scott and me.
I've simply resumed my career.
Well, one of my careers.
Mostly at Scott's urging,
I might add.
It would hardly be a proper motor
racing season...
... without the Stoddard name connected
to it in some way, would it, Pat?
Considering what the Stoddards have been
to the sport in the past few years.
Needless to say, I'm present in a far more
humble capacity than Scott would be.
I'm delighted to be able to represent
the name for the rest of this season.
Pat, when did you last talk to Scott?
Can you give us some idea
of how he's coming along?
Oh, we talk two or three times a day.
He's coming along beautifully.
And he wants everyone to know
how very grateful he is for all the hun...
That interview concludes this broadcast from Clemont Ferrand.
Tomorrow at 3:00, there will be a live transmission...
...of the start of the French Grand Prix.
- Hello, Jean-Pierre.
- Hello.
Hello. Pete.
You were fine.
That was beautiful, Pat.
Really beautiful.
Particularly the part about representing the Stoddard name?
That was especially good.
You'll have to be careful, though.
If Scott gets a load of that kind of thing, he's liable to recover very quickly.
You'll be out of a career again.
You're very superior, Mr. Aron.
For the man to put Scott Stoddard where he is.
Scott put Scott where he is.
That was a perfectly appalling thing, what he said to that girl.
He may have done it badly, but he isn't altogether wrong, you know.
The Stoddards don't exactly have what one would call a fairy-tale marriage.
- Well, that's their business, isn't it?
- Not if she chooses...
...to discuss it in front of a television camera.
Now, would you care for some lunch?
Nino seems to have enough there for all of us.
That's what comes of a poverty-stricken childhood.
This girl has died from over-timing.
Enough food. I need the sun.
The sun it will be.
Sun, food and sex.
It's hard to think of them
10 years from now.
Fat and married.
With five fat children.
Maybe.
Maybe they'll avoid it.
The marriage or the fat?
Both.
You don't believe in marriage?
It depends on whose marriage it is.
- I apologize for that.
- Why?
Because it was bad manners.
What does it matter to you what I do or don't do?
A girl has to make a living.
Last time a girl said that to me, she was stepping out of her skirt...
...and asking for a hundred-dollar bill.
- Making a comparison?
When did you last talk to Scott?
- At Monaco.
- That's sweet.
Why are we being so offensive?
Probably because we don't like each other.
Speak for yourself.
Now, you see?
The object is to put the fly exactly where you want it to be.
Well, what difference does it make?
It's a big lake.
The difference is the art of it.
We could wade out and hit the fish over the head...
...but there would be no art in that, would there? Now...
Now, is that where you wanted it to land?
Would I admit to anything else?
Where was I?
You began racing because of your marriage.
Yeah.
When we got married,
Monique and I...
...Delvaux had just started competition and I began testing cars.
The next step, of course, was racing.
Delvaux stopped racing some years ago.
But I kept on.
Why?
Well, actually I think
I've begun to wonder myself.
But I suppose it doesn't really matter.
A man does what he does.
We do what we most want to do,
I suppose.
Now, you try.
Here, and here.
Hold it here.
This way. Here.
Where are the fish?
The fire is too high.
We must have a bed of embers.
We will have a bed of cold gray ashes by the time you catch a fish.
Have faith, Nino.
I tell you, there are fish.
Now, very gently.
Come on. Now.
- Very good.
- There.
Is that a good place for it to be?
Doesn't really matter.
It's a big lake.
Hey! My stomach refuses to accept your promises any longer.
If there were some beefsteak,
I would cook you meat...
...in the style of the Auvergne.
- An excellent idea.
There is no beefsteak.
We will have fish.
In the house, hidden behind the cheese...
...in the cooler: Beefsteak.
We will save some for you because there are no fish in this lake.
Go away, Nino!
You are too close!
Why aren't you married?
Well, it's not a very subtle question, is it?
I need all my subtlety for the trout.
How do you know I'm not married?
I have noted the unmarried woman's brave air of independence...
...mingled with vague longing.
Independence, maybe.
Vague longing. I wasn't aware of that.
Something perhaps only a man would see.
Or imagine.
Well, no vague longing, then?
But not too much independence either, I hope.
Very bad for a woman to be too independent.
Very bad for whom?
I like to be free.
I like traveling.
I like making my own decisions.
Meeting new people, working.
I like to be free.
I was married once.
But he was in love with someone else.
You going to win tomorrow?
Probably.
Could we declare a truce long enough for you to buy me a drink?
Sure.
I'll have one of those.
Well, Sarti did it again.
Yeah, he drove a good race.
How do you like your new job?
It's what I've always wanted to do.
You know, I've known you for, what?
Two and a half years.
And all I know about you is that you drive cars.
That's all anyone knows so far as I can tell.
You've just written my biography.
"The Silent and Secretive Pete Aron."
"Inside Pete Aron."
"What's Pete Aron Really Like?"
It will never sell.
Will you give me a lift back to the hotel?
I'll never understand why none of you...
...get this sort of thing out of your systems on the track.
We all drive like maniacs.
I've left Scott, you know.
Really.
Yes, I know.
You've got a great sense of timing.
You think I should be at his bedside, nursing him back to health and vigor?
I guess I'm just an old-fashioned boy at heart.
You don't understand.
I left him because he won't quit.
He won't stop racing.
And I couldn't take it anymore.
I couldn't stand it.
You know what he does the night before a race?
He lies in bed and sweats.
But then, you wouldn't know what that would be like for a woman.
To live with that.
Will you go back to America when you are finished with your click-click?
Yes, of course.
You couldn't be persuaded to remain in Europe?
My life is in America.
What is your life?
What is it?
I never thought about that, I suppose.
Well, think about it.
Friends...
...work.
That's my life.
My friends and my work.
Well, one needs those.
But what do you need now?
Nothing.
Liar.
Come with me, Louise.
- Where?
- To a place I have in Monza.
I have to go there to test a new car.
There are two weeks before the Belgium Grand Prix.
We could leave tonight after the party.
Come with me.
And your wife?
We share nothing but our business interests.
Nothing.
What do you think we would share?
More than that.
A bed?
More than that.
With luck.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
- Why do you all do that?
- Do what?
Wear your sunglasses on top of your head?
- I don't know.
- It looks ridiculous.
I guess you're going to the party tonight.
- No. You?
- No.
What are you going to do about dinner?
- How many guesses do I get?
- Nine.
- Guesses?
- O'clock.
Mr. Yamura?
Mr. Yamura, I got your message.
Your message.
Yes, I was hoping it would reach you in time.
Well, I thought...
Well, you do speak English.
Yes, but not for the press.
I hope you will forgive me.
That's quite all right.
There have been times when I wish I'd been able to pull something like that myself.
I gather, then, that you didn't ask me here as a reporter?
Will you join me in some tea?
Some years ago, when I decided to race cars...
...I tried to buy the Jordan-BRM Company.
Oh, yes. I had heard that.
Impatience on my part.
I also manufacture radios and sewing machines.
In order to save time,
I wanted a proven product.
That was not to be, however.
Racing cars are not merely another product.
They require great attention.
If any success is to be hoped for.
Than that's why you're here.
I have been racing my car in Formula 1 for two years.
And have yet to win my first Grand Prix.
I intend to win by whatever means are open to me.
That's the right attitude.
All you have to do is go fast enough and long enough.
And with the best drivers.
Do you want a job with me?
- Driving?
- Driving, of course.
- Who are you dumping?
- Dumping?
Oh, which one of your drivers are you getting rid of?
Neither one.
I am entering a third car.
- That will be expensive.
- Yes.
You've got a driver.
My racing headquarters is at Silverstone in England.
- Can you be there next week?
- Yes, sir.
We must begin to think about Spa.
- Next week, then.
- By the way, you are a terrible broadcaster.
Mr. Aron.
If giving you the job would have meant firing...
...one of the other drivers, would you still have taken it?
Good.
- Is it true what you said about Scott?
- What?
About not being able to sleep the night before a race?
A man like that should be in some other line of work.
I'll bet you sleep like a baby.
I'm divorcing him.
Are you?
Why tell me?
Well, because I don't think you were entirely joking...
...when you said you're an old-fashioned boy at heart.
And old-fashioned boys have old-fashioned scruples.
- About what?
- About other people's wives.
I don't follow you.
Like hell you don't.
Good night.
- Memo?
- Jean-Pierre.
Memo, good to see you.
I would like you to meet Miss Frederickson.
How do you do?
Yes, there's luggage in the car.
Rafael?
Come, I'll show you around.
The only member of this club?
The only one who keeps an apartment here.
In fact, I have the only apartment.
"Jean-Pierre Sarti,
World Champion, 1961."
It's so quiet.
Appreciate it while you can.
At Grand Prix time, crowds, excitement, noise. Terrible.
- Care to drink?
- No.
Are you very tired?
No.
To health, wealth and happiness.
You are very greedy.
No.
Hopeful.
There are seven more races.
Yes, seven.
And then?
Do you want to think that far?
No.
Good.
Now I feel marvelous.
Marvelous.
And you?
Yes.
Smile for the cameras.
Come.
As you can see, we work day and night here...
...to get the car ready.
I'll take your word for it.
We must immediately mold the cockpit for you.
Yes, sir.
All right? Or too long?
- I like what you've done here.
- Thank you.
I was afraid it might have offended.
Offended? How?
My not adapting to your ways.
No, not at all, sir.
I promise you, if I'm ever in Japan and I entertain you for dinner...
...you'll get a fork.
Fair enough.
Right after the war...
...my house in Tokyo was used by an American general and his family.
When it was returned to me...
...it had flowered wallpaper...
...three new bathrooms and four new closets.
Americans, I think, are over-devoted...
...to bathrooms and closets.
Well, we accumulate things.
And then you lock them away in closets.
And the bathrooms?
No, no. You don't get me on that one.
- Were you in the war?
- Yes. And you?
No, I missed it by a year.
In the war, I was a fighter pilot.
I shot down 17 American planes.
- Okay.
- I believe...
...that some things must not be left unsaid.
There will come a time...
...when you will ask yourself:
"What did he do in the war?
This man, Yamura?"
- Mr. Yamura, I like you.
- Why?
Well, because...
- Because you come right to the point.
- In a sense...
...you're here because you drive a car...
...the way I conduct my business.
You come right to the point.
- Hello, Mrs. Stoddard. Nice to see you.
- Jeff.
- Scott.
- That's okay, just get me the crutches.
- All right, come here.
- Hello, Mother.
- It's good to have you home.
- How are you? The place looks terrific.
Thanks. Hello.
- Welcome home, sir.
- Thank you.
Gates, come and shake my hand.
- How are you?
- Terrific, thank you.
Come along in.
Careful there, it's slippery.
Can you manage all right?
I'll get Thompson to bring lunch to your room.
- I'll eat downstairs.
- You can't go downstairs again.
I'm getting up the stairs,
I can certainly get down them again.
If worse comes to the worse,
I can always slide down the banisters.
- Right?
- Yes.
- You'll stay for lunch, Jeff?
- I'd love to.
I should've thought you'd have cleared this lot out long ago.
- Why?
- Roger's dead.
It's just too bloody morbid.
- Where are your own things?
- I don't know.
Around somewhere.
Of course, they're nothing compared to this lot.
Something to shoot for, old boy.
You gotta have something to shoot for.
- Okay, you can say what you're thinking.
- What am I thinking?
That I haven't got all this to shoot for anymore.
But you're wrong, you know.
Quite wrong.
What really scares me, here at Spa, is driving into a cloudburst.
You're doing 160 in the dry...
...then you're suddenly driving into a wall of rain.
Can't even see the car in front.
Just like trying to swim underwater in the dark.
Please, Bob, in a moment.
The point is, gentlemen...
...the road condition on the approach to the S's before Stavalo...
...have not been improved over last year.
If anything, they're worse.
I don't see how they could possibly be worse than last year.
- Let's write them a letter.
- They file letters.
A strongly-worded letter, official, from the Driver Association.
They have a special file for strongly-worded letters...
...from the association.
- We gonna talk about calling the race off...
...in the event of rain?
- No, no.
Please, Ritchie, one thing at a time.
The subject is road condition.
They haven't changed the road in 10 years. They not liable to do it.
We know you're taking your life in your hands driving in the rain.
- When are we gonna do something?
- A letter demanding that the road...
...be paved.
- They can't pave the road by tomorrow.
- What's the point in talking about it?
- We talk about this business of rain...
...every year. It's damn well time we did something.
Well, let's demand to cancel it, if it rains.
You can't cancel this race.
- Or postpone it.
- You can't even postpone it.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
What about the flag marshaling?
Hey, look who's here.
It's Scott.
Find out which room they're in.
- Don't be foolish...
- Come on, man, find out.
- What are you doing here?
- How are you?
How are you?
Hooray! Hooray!
- Hey, Scott.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Hey, Scott.
How are you?
How are you?
Is that you, Pete?
Better be.
Meeting over?
Scott's here.
What?
We'd better have a talk.
What do you wanna talk about, Pete?
May I...?
Really, Scott, this isn't in very good taste.
That's very good, darling.
That's very good.
Isn't it, Aron?
I'm afraid you got a point, Scott.
He has a point.
- What do you want, Scott?
- You.
Do you mind, Aron? I'd like to have a word with my wife alone.
- I've missed you.
- Well...
...that's a lie for a start.
Why do you say that? It's true.
If you've missed me, it's only because you haven't had your damn cars to fill your life.
That's all I've ever been good for, something for you to do between races.
When will you stop belittling yourself?
Don't psychoanalyze me.
I'm sorry.
I hate that sort of thing myself.
You walk in here and calmly ask him to leave...
...and expect me to believe you care one way or another about me.
What do you want me to do?
Assault him with my crutches?
- That's not very funny.
- No, it isn't.
I do care.
More than I can talk about.
But that isn't getting us anywhere, is it?
I want you back, Pat.
I'm gonna be driving again soon.
- I need you with me.
- No, no.
I've told you, Scott, I can't do it.
I can't live like that.
I won't.
What about him? He drives.
- It's different with him.
- Why?
- It just is.
- Because you don't love him.
I don't know what that has to do with anything.
You know one of the most beautiful things about a car?
If it isn't working properly, you can strip the skin off...
...expose the insides...
...find out exactly where the trouble is...
...take out the faulty part and replace it with a new one.
If only we could do that with people.
Good luck.
Luck has nothing to do with this either.
Bye.
With Jean-Pierre Sarti's Ferrari
in pole position.
Ten seconds to the start
of the Belgian Grand Prix.
Sarti's in the lead at La Source.
Almost the end of the first lap, and already
he's ahead of the second car.
It's Pete Aron's Yamura.
And there's Brabham running right
round the outside of Barlini.
Brabham in third place...
... but the Ferrari might just take him
again on acceleration.
They're side by side, down past the pits.
Barlini's going ahead.
He's outbraked Brabham into Eau Rouge,
and it's number seven Ferrari in third place.
And it's Jean-Pierre Sarti completing
his 16th lap.
The race is now half over.
Since the rain began, he's increased
his lead by three or four seconds a lap.
The worse the conditions,
the bigger the old champion's advantage.
If the Ferrari keeps going, this will be
his third Grand Prix win of the season.
Barlini's also very fast in the wet.
He's now a clear third ahead
of Jack Brabham.
There's Jochen Rindt coming out
of La Source.
He lost nearly a lap when he spun
in the worst of the cloudburst.
And there he is passing Guy Ligier,
moving up another place.
Here's the leader, completing
his 30th lap. He's got a big lead.
Jean-Pierre Sarti, winner of Monaco
and French Grand Prixs...
... is only two laps away
from his third consecutive win.
Here's the winner now.
The Yamura wins...
... and Pete Aron wins the Belgian Grand Prix
in the white Yamura from Japan.
But as Pete Aron
comes in after his victory...
... there's Izo Yamura...
... going to congratulate him
for bringing the...
His car home in first place
today in the Belgian Grand Prix.
Pete Aron, of course, won five Grand Prixs
in the past when he was with Ferraris...
... but that was three years ago.
He's had a lot of bad luck since then.
It's great to see him back
in the winning position...
- He drove a good race.
...so soon after joining the up-and-coming...
... Yamura team from Japan.
We'll see how good he is at Zandvoort.
Barlini's second place for Ferrari, too,
will be very popular in Italy.
And there's Aron now, up on the platform
being presented with a garland of flowers...
... and Mr. Yamura joining him.
Both delighted with the quick success
of this new partnership...
... which has brought Yamura his first
Grand Prix victory after two years of flying.
He must be very pleased, indeed,
with Aron's performance today.
The 400 horsepower Yamura,
the most powerful of all the cars in the...
Albert! Groat!
- Let him go. Let him go.
- And here's Sarti coming in...
Are you all right?
Out of the way.
Out of the way, everybody.
Children? There were children?
I'm afraid Paris is impossible this week, darling.
I must go right to Modena.
The car...
...it's completely wiped out, you see.
It will be necessary to...
Stop it, Guido.
- Stop it.
- Get him out of here.
It will be necessary to test a new one for the Nürburgring.
A very difficult course, but one of the most beautiful.
- You will...
- Oh, stop.
Thing is, will it start?
It'll start.
Yeah, Roger had some very big days in this car.
Coming into the pits now
is Scott Stoddard in the BRM.
The Dutch Grand Prix, here at Zandvoort
tomorrow, will be his first race...
... since his accident
at Monte Carlo in May.
His serious injuries
must be extremely painful.
- How did I do?
- You just set a new lap record.
The whole BRM crew
look very pleased.
Right, you owe me a bottle of the best.
- Yes, indeed I do.
- Yamura.
One minute, 26.5 seconds...
... 108.5 miles an hour.
Aron, the American driver, won
the last two Grand Prixs at Spa in Belgium.
And the German Grand Prix last week
at the Nürburgring.
He now shares the lead
in the World Championship with 18 points.
Exactly the same as the Ferrari driver,
Jean-Pierre Sarti, the Frenchman.
Sarti's best practice time so far
on this 2.6- Mile Zandvoort circuit...
... is one minute, 27. 1.
Now, here's Stoddard's best lap.
One minute, 25.9.
The fastest lap ever on this circuit.
What a wonderful comeback
for this brave young driver.
What a shame.
He's falling off.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Then it seems to be all right?
Of course it seems to be all right.
It's always all right when you're around.
Then there is nothing wrong, is there?
It stuck in practice yesterday, and it still doesn't feel right.
- But it doesn't stick now!
- I'm telling you, it does!
Jean-Pierre, just because you have been running badly lately...
...it's no reason to take these things out on me.
If you want a day off this afternoon, just say so.
I'm here to race. Understand?
- To race.
- Okay, be quiet.
There you are, my beauty.
- See if it's all there, will you, my man?
- It better all be there. Half of it's mine.
Does that look like $ 17,000 to you?
Yeah.
Marvel.
That's what you are, Scott.
A bloody marvel.
Here. You know, of course, what you did here.
I know. I don't have to see it up there to know.
It's bad enough to lose without having to watch yourself do it.
What's the point of this anyway?
To see if we can determine why you are losing.
Well, you're not gonna find the answer up there.
What about your other two drivers?
Why aren't they here? Why only me?
Because they are not winners.
But you are.
You are losing to a man who needs...
...almost to be carried to and from his car.
How can that be?
Because he's driving better than I am.
He's making fewer mistakes.
- That's why anyone wins.
- Exactly.
Now, shall we turn our attention to the mistakes?
About-face.
By the left, quick march.
Today's British Grand Prix will be Nino
Barlini's first race here at Brands Hatch.
But his teammate, Jean-Pierre Sarti
of France, the number-one Ferrari driver...
... and Pete Aron of the Yamura team,
have both driven before...
... here on England's premier circuit.
The second Yamura driver, Tim Randolph,
comes from the United States...
... as does Pete Aron, who's already won
the Belgian and German Grand Prixs.
There are 24 starters in this British Grand
Prix. They're on the dummy grid now...
... getting last-minute instructions
from the team managers.
There's BRM driver, Bob Turner.
Mr. Yamura himself is with Pete Aron.
And there's the winner of the last three
Grand Prixs, Scott Stoddard...
... who's still recovering
from his Monte Carlo injuries...
... and leads the World Championship
with two races to go.
There's Jimmy Clark, the Scotsman,
who has twice been world champion.
That's the signal to clear the grid.
The engines are starting.
The mechanics and photographers
are moving off the track.
Now the field rolls forward
to the final grid...
... where they'll be held for a few seconds
before the starter drops the Union Jack...
... and then the British Grand Prix
will be under way.
In the lead after 15 laps
is Scott Stoddard...
... but he's losing ground now.
Stoddard, in the dark-green BRM
number four, made a slow start...
... then worked his way
to the front of the field.
During the first 12 laps
he built up a substantial lead.
- But his lap times are slower now...
- His lap times are awfully erratic.
- On the BRM. They're Barlini, number 18,
who was just ahead...
... of number 17, Jean-Pierre Sarti,
14, Pete Aron, and 11, Jochen Rindt.
These three are having a great dice
for third place.
At Bottom Bend,
Stoddard lost three more places.
If he keeps missing shifts, the car will never last.
It'll last longer than he will.
He's finished already.
Barlini's the leader,
but he's not far ahead of Sarti and Aron.
Here's Stoddard coming into the pits
very slowly.
Goodness, he looks as if
he's on the edge of collapse.
What a shame,
he was driving a beautiful race.
Scott Stoddard
does seem to be in a bad way.
His retirement certainly puts
a new complexion on the race.
Barlini leads, but Ferrari team leader
Sarti, Aron...
... and Rindt, all have
the Sicilian in their sights.
A tremendous battle for second place
between Sarti and Aron.
Although there's one more World
Championship race to go at Monza in Italy...
... the result here at Brands Hatch
is very important to both these men.
Izo Yamura himself is dedicated to winning
the Constructors Championship...
... and Aron is his only hope
here at Brands.
His second car, driven by Tim Randolph,
blew up its engine early in the race.
Here comes the leader, Barlini.
He's not far ahead
of Sarti, Aron and Rindt.
One lap to go.
Sarti and Aron are close to Barlini.
- The last lap.
- Aron hasn't a chance...
... of getting past both Ferraris. This is
going to be the most exciting finish...
... of the Grand Prix season so far.
At Bottom Bend, the first four
are nose-to-tail: Barlini, Sarti, Aron, Rindt.
Barlini dare not let Sarti through.
It's much too dodgy
with the Yamura right behind.
Look. He's spilling something.
Looks like fuel.
Gas leaking?
As they come into Clearways,
Barlini's still in front.
The Yamura's smoking badly. It's on fire.
He's on fire!
The Yamura's second,
ahead of Sarti's Ferrari. It's on fire.
It's well and truly on fire.
But Aron's not slowing.
He's gonna beat Sarti to the finish.
There's the flag, Barlini wins for Ferrari.
Aron's second and Sarti third.
The Yamura's
pulling off the track.
There are flames shooting out of the back
of the car. Let's hope Aron can get out.
There's a fire crew right there.
He should be all right.
He's rolled out of the car.
Keep back. Keep back.
What a shambles. Some of the crowd
are rushing to the fire, and Sarti's stopping.
He's going to see
if there's anything he can do.
Izo Yamura's also running
across the track with Tim Randolph.
From here, it looks
as though Pete Aron's on his feet.
- He must be okay...
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
- For the last few seconds of the race.
I'm okay. I'm okay.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, what'd we make?
- Second.
- I'm a regular ball of fire.
A fire like this is what these drivers
are most afraid of.
Nowadays their fireproof overalls
give them a good deal of protection.
- Get out of here!
- Photographers must keep back.
Please keep back.
Nino Barlini's up there on the trailer
ready to go around on his lap of honor.
The team manager of Ferrari is there too.
And there's a beautiful bird coming up
to join him on the trailer.
Hey, Nino.
Nino Barlini, excuse me. Congratulations.
- How do you feel after that victory?
- Thank you.
My neck hurts, my leg.
My hand is bleeding. And I feel wonderful.
Well, I don't know if you've had time to realize it...
...but this means that you're one point ahead of Sarti and Stoddard...
...and two points ahead of Pete Aron.
- Of course I realize it.
And with one race to go at Monza...
...the man who wins at Monza will be the world champion.
I am the man.
So long, Nino. Congratulations.
I feel wonderful.
Yeah, come in.
How are you?
I'm pretty bloody awful.
How are you?
Would you...
...care to sit down?
This has been a ridiculous few weeks, hasn't it?
Has it?
Well, I mean, seeing each other at the races and not...
Well, ignoring each other.
Trying to.
I've been alone.
You know that, don't you?
Yeah. Here.
- Pete said you had guts, and I...
- I'm not really interested in what he said.
I certainly don't want to discuss him with you. I've told you.
I didn't mean...
I meant that when he said you had guts,
I said you were only stubborn.
I just wanted to tell you that he was right and I was wrong.
Watching what you've been doing these past few weeks...
You shouldn't have been doing it alone.
Yeah, there's only room for one in the car, you know.
- I don't mean that. You know I don't.
- I know.
It was a joke.
Do you still want me, Scott?
Yes.
I still feel the same about what you're doing.
That hasn't changed, you know.
I think you're a fool.
Yeah, I know.
But...
...I haven't changed either, you know.
I mean...
...I really can't promise you anything.
That's all right.
That's the problem, really.
People promise each other too much.
What's wrong, Jean-Pierre?
What is it?
There's nothing you can do about what's wrong with me, Louise.
I won't admit that until I know what's troubling you.
I suppose what's wrong with me is my life.
But I can't change it. Or won't.
So there's nothing you can do for me.
What's wrong with your life?
I've begun to see the absurdity of it.
All of us.
Proving what?
That we can go faster?
And perhaps remain alive?
Nino, gambling his life for a trophy...
...then fills it with beer and does tricks.
Stoddard, filling himself with drugs in order to drive...
...and still passing out with the pain.
Don't you see how absurd it all is?
Who cares?
I thought you cared.
For yourselves.
I didn't know you asked it of anyone else.
Nevertheless, others do care.
A hundred thousand of them cared today.
And did you see them rush to see Peter burn?
Did you see the looks on their faces? I saw.
For the first time today,
I really saw those faces.
But not all of them, Jean-Pierre.
There are some who come for that, for the accidents and the fires.
But the others, the others ride with you, maybe.
You put something in their lives that they can't put there themselves.
Are you one of those?
It doesn't matter.
Yes, it does.
Maybe I am one of those.
When I came here three months ago...
...there was a place in my life that needed to be filled.
You've done that.
You and, I suppose, the excitement of what you do.
But you offered me these things.
You can't condemn me now for having accepted them.
No, I don't condemn you for that, darling.
Sorry.
Jean-Pierre, you can stop.
If you feel as you do, you could stop now.
No, it's not so easy.
Not so easy.
Not so easy.
With the Italian Grand Prix
at the Monza Autodrome...
... they're using a combination
of the banked oval high-speed track...
... and the road circuit.
The whole thing comes
to six and a quarter miles...
... just over half of this length
being the road circuit...
... with its fast corners
and long straights.
By itself, it's one of the
fastest circuits in the world.
And combined with the oval track,
it should give some phenomenal speeds.
Why hasn't my car arrived, Guido?
It's no longer in my hands,
Jean-Pierre.
What's the trouble?
My car hasn't arrived from the factory.
The same thing has happened before.
Not to me, but to other drivers who have fallen from grace.
Pressure.
Pressure?
Isn't there enough of that as it is?
You have to grasp the mind of Signor Manetta, my darling.
If a driver can be reached by those tactics...
...it means he probably will fear for his place on the team.
That is exactly what Manetta wants.
Because that driver will try all the harder to win.
He will perhaps take a risk which he would ordinarily avoid.
And risks are always risks.
But the car will come.
Well, if it doesn't,
I'll use my influence...
...and I'll get you the best seat in the grandstand.
- No sign of it?
- No.
Don't worry, Jean-Pierre.
That's what they want you to do.
He makes a great mistake, then.
Are you sure you wanted it to come?
A maximum of about 180 miles an hour
can be expected from these 3-liter cars...
... on this high banking,
where they get...
... a pounding from the rough surface and
the strain imposed by centrifugal force...
... before they swoop down
onto the road circuit again...
... where cornering power
and handling are at the premium.
- Good afternoon, Nino.
- Madame Sarti.
Have you met Miss Frederickson?
Madame Sarti.
- Hello, Monique.
- Hello, Louise.
So you are leading in points for the championship, Nino.
But not by as many points as I would like, Madame Sarti.
All you have to do is to beat my husband.
The question is, is he ready to be beaten?
Please excuse me,
I have some work to do back at the hotel.
- Nino, tell Jean-Pierre...
- Yes, yes.
- She's quite good-looking, isn't she?
- Yes.
Of course, for one who cares for the type.
Yes. Excuse me,
Madame Sarti.
Oh, no, wait.
Let me stand... It's better?
The question is, Jean-Pierre, what are you going to do about it?
Do?
I don't understand.
The time for losing comes to every man, of course.
I had not expected yours to come so soon.
There have been problems with the car.
Come, come, Sarti.
I expect excuses like that from lesser men than you.
You've been one of the best that ever lived.
There is no question of that in my mind.
Never a wrong move, the concentration always there 100 percent.
Until this woman.
You have been misled,
Signor Manetta.
Do you take me for a trained dog to jump at the snap of your fingers?
My life belongs to no one but myself.
I've been thinking seriously of your retirement, Sarti.
Then retire me now.
Kindly lower your voice.
Of course I will not retire you now.
Tomorrow there is a race to be run.
And I also well know that you want to drive it.
But after tomorrow, who knows, Jean-Pierre?
After tomorrow, Signor Manetta,
I will decide to retire or not.
Sarti, you are even further gone than I thought.
A pity.
A great pity.
I always considered you to be the best.
I'm still the best.
What brings you to Monza, Monique?
- Business, of course.
- Of course.
Nino wonders if you're ready to be beaten.
No one is ever ready for that.
You will never retire,
Jean-Pierre.
What does it matter to you, Monique?
- To me?
- Yeah.
As always, as a hero, you're a good asset to the company.
Well, perhaps I'm tired of being an asset for the company.
And tired too, of this farce we perform, you and I, for public consumption.
But it doesn't really matter that you are tired of these things, Jean-Pierre.
If you should decide not to continue with the... The farce, as you call it...
...that, of course, is entirely up to you.
But it will make no difference.
As long as you're my husband...
...the company will have the prestige of your name...
...and whether or not you ever step into one of these again.
And you will always be my husband.
You know that, don't you?
This one, she may be different to you...
...but not to me.
To me, she is just like all the others.
And we will always be married, you and I.
Stay away from me, Monique.
Let me alone, please.
Tell me. What terrible thing have I done to you...
...that makes you want to nail me to this absurd life we have together?
What terrible thing, Monique?
Do you think it's been worth it, Pat?
All the effort, even if I win tomorrow?
Worth it to you?
Only you can know that, Scott.
Yeah, I suppose so.
Well, let's go and have a party.
Scott, are you sure you want to go?
Wouldn't you rather rest?
After tomorrow, I shall be a long time resting. Come on.
Have I thanked you?
For what?
For being here.
Thank you.
Hey, sayonara.
My goodness, Nino. I thought they belonged to the Yamura boys.
I have them on temporary loan.
- Really? Two of them?
- They are very small.
See you later, maybe.
Can I buy you a drink?
I don't drink.
I don't smoke.
The end?
The end.
I looked at the photographs last night.
Very good.
Thank you.
And what you wrote, also very good.
Well, your work may be finished, but mine is not.
It's time.
I don't want to see the race, Jean-Pierre.
Why not?
Because I'm ashamed.
Ashamed?
Of what?
Of what it's meant to be, I suppose.
The racing.
And now, knowing what it means to you, the uncertainty.
I don't want to watch anymore.
Ever.
You're being very foolish, you know.
Let me be foolish, then.
I'm going to win today.
You don't want to miss that, do you?
Please, Jean-Pierre.
I don't want to go.
Well...
...to work, then.
I love you, Jean-Pierre.
And I you.
We'll have to discuss the consequences of those terrible words, huh?
Hey, where were you last night?
- Where were you?
- Come here.
Am I expected to account for my whereabouts at every moment?
- Am I?
- It is not the same thing.
You are a woman.
- I'm leaving you.
- Leaving? For how long?
For always, you fool.
Forever.
I met a boy, an American...
...who wants to go to the Greek islands and dive for relics.
In the first place, diving is a great bore.
How do you know?
Have you ever done it?
Some things one can tell without doing them...
...that they will be a great bore.
Underwater is for fish, not people.
In the second place, they are not relics at all.
I have on good authority from a close friend...
...that these things are manufactured and then dumped into the water...
...to be found by foolish
American boy tourists.
And the girls who are foolish enough to go with them.
This is the most ridiculous thing
I ever heard.
I have it on very good authority from a close friend.
Do you want me to stay?
You are old enough to make your own decisions.
Then I'm going, all right?
Yes, I definitely think you should go to the Greek islands...
...with your American boyfriend.
I think you should go to hell.
You gonna be in the pits today?
The last time this combined circuit
was used was in 1961.
There were objections
from drivers who thought...
... the light one-and-a-half liter
Formula 1 cars of that time...
... were not suitable for the strain
imposed by the banking.
Bearing in mind, the suspension
had to be a compromise setting...
... to allow for effective cornering
on the road section.
The bigger cars
of the present formula...
... should be better able
to stand up to the conditions.
Hi, Pat.
How are you?
- Okay. You?
- All right.
Hope he beats you by at least 10 laps today.
I'm glad you feel that way.
What if he doesn't?
We'll survive it one way or another.
Good luck.
Scott Stoddard has 27 points
in the championship...
... exactly the same as Jean-Pierre Sarti.
In the lead with 28 points is Nino Barlini,
while Pete Aron has 26.
In just two hours, one of these men
will be the new world champion.
They're off.
Sarti is stalled.
He can't get away.
Go away! You will disqualify me!
No, no! No!
Sarti's away at last.
Leaders are onto the banking
for the first time...
... with Barlini's Ferrari in front
of Stoddard's BRM and Aron's Yamura.
Then Brabham, Gurney and Scarfiotti.
The order's Barlini, Stoddard,
Aron, Brabham, Gurney, Scarfiotti.
And tell me, Scott...
... are there any particular problems
in driving on the Monza banking?
The banking?
Well, it's just so damn rough up there,
that the car flicks all over the place.
We're never below 180, you know.
At that speed, your reactions
can barely keep up...
... with these sudden changes in direction.
The trouble is, the high centrifugal forces
push the car into the banking...
... and use up
all the suspension movement.
So, what you're driving
becomes a car with no springs.
It feels like you're getting a series
of punches in the back.
I hate it. I'm sick of pain.
But it's what the car is suffering
that really worries me.
Because no matter how the car
is set up...
... it bottoms at several places
on both bankings.
The underside of the car just comes
crashing down onto the biggest bumps.
Everything's shaking
and banging all the time.
Sometimes you could swear
the whole thing's falling to bits.
Well, none of us
like Monza very much.
It's so damn fast
and they run so close together...
... it requires fantastic concentration
and rather special skills.
Slipstreaming, for instance.
At speeds reaching 180 miles an hour,
race car's making a big hole in the air.
As the car goes through, the air rushes back
into the hole and creates a hell of a draft.
And that draft's strong enough to pull
a following car along at...
Oh, 10 miles
more than his usual top speed.
If yours is the last car in a bunch,
you can get a terrific tow.
You can back way off the gas pedal
and maintain the same speed.
Then you can put your foot down...
... pull out of the slipstream and maybe
overtake two, three cars at once.
The only thing to do here is to drive
just as fast as you know how...
... and hope your car doesn't break.
At the end of the fifth lap,
Barlini's in the lead by five seconds.
Now both Stoddard and Aron
have lost the Ferrari's slipstream.
And they're dropping back
in their great dice for second place.
Coming up the main straight is number four,
Jean-Pierre Sarti's Ferrari in 14th place.
With 10 laps gone
and only 18 seconds behind Barlini...
... after losing nearly half a minute
when his engine stalled at the start.
With 40 laps to go, Sarti could still
catch the leader and win the race.
Are you never afraid?
Not ever.
Why?
Because I am immortal.
Why do you drive racing cars?
Or do you not think about it?
Well, Mr. Yamura,
I don't think there's one of us...
...who doesn't ask himself at least once in the middle of a race:
"What the hell am I doing here?"
Of course, when it's over, we conveniently forget that we ask ourselves that question.
I think about it.
There are a lot of reasons, I don't know.
Maybe to do something...
...that brings you so close to the possibility of death and to survive it...
...is to feel life and living so much more intensely.
- Be careful there, it's slippery.
- Okay.
Can you manage all right?
I'm all right. It's okay.
I'll get Thompson to bring lunch up.
- I'll eat downstairs, Mom.
- You can't go downstairs again.
Look, I'm getting up the stairs,
I can certainly get down them.
If worse comes to the worse, I can always slide down the banisters.
- Right?
- Yes.
This isn't good, you know, what I feel now.
What do you feel?
That I would almost rather stay here with you than get into the car.
Almost.
I suppose at my age, one moves slowly from one habit to the next.
I must go, darling.
There's Barlini on his 17th lap.
His Ferrari is just a bit too fast,
even for Pete Aron's Yamura...
... and Scott Stoddard's BRM.
They're in second and third places.
There's a splendid scrap for fourth place,
with Tim Randolph in the second Yamura...
... just ahead of Dan Gurney in the Eagle,
and Bob Turner in the other BRM.
As they sweep around the banking...
... Sarti's gonna catch up with the three cars
fighting for fourth place.
He's passed Tim Randolph, now watch
him go underneath Gurney in the Eagle.
Yes, he's passed him, and now
he's passing Bob Turner in the BRM.
He's fourth. Sarti's fourth.
There are three cars in front.
When Sarti's lapped them...
... he'll only have Aron and Stoddard
between him and the leader, Barlini.
We've just heard
there's been an accident.
It's Sarti. Sarti's Ferrari
has gone clean over the north banking...
... and landed at the side
of the track below. Then it caught fire.
Oh, Jean-Pierre!
Oh, Jean-Pierre.
Jean-Pierre. Oh, Jean-Pierre.
Oh, Jean-Pierre.
No. No!
No, Jean-Pierre!
Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre!
No! Jean-Pierre!
Jean-Pierre.
Jean-Pierre! Jean-Pierre.
Jean-Pierre.
Jean-Pierre!
What do you want?
Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?
The Commendatore is showing
a black flag to his drivers.
He's withdrawing the whole Ferrari team.
I don't think it's been done like this
for 40 years.
The Alfa Romeo team manager
did the same thing once in the '20s...
... when Antonio Ascari was killed
in the French Grand Prix.
He showed the black flag to Campari and
Brilli-Peri when the Alfas were in the lead.
Here comes Barlini into the pits now
in response to the black-flag signal.
- Jean-Pierre?
- He'll have to be told the news...
... of his team leader's death.
And this tragic race is over
for the young Sicilian.
In the lead are Aron and Stoddard.
They've just gone past the pits,
side by side, fighting for the lead.
Last lap now.
Stoddard or Aron?
They're still neck and neck,
wheel to wheel, the whole way.
Stoddard's in front as they
come into the last corner.
Aron, in the Yamura,
is right on his tail.
He can still beat the BRM to the flag.
It was Aron. The Yamura
was just a wheel in front of the BRM.
Aron is the new world champion.
It looked as if
the Yamura was just in front.
Aron is the winner.
Aron is the new world champion.
Pete Aron of the United States has won
the Italian Grand Prix for Yamura of Japan.
And Scott Stoddard
in the BRM was second.
What a race.
What a tremendous race.
Sarti?
Pete Aron is greeted as the winner
of the Italian Grand Prix...
... and this gives him
the World Drivers' Championship.
A great triumph for this determined
American driver and Izo Yamura of Japan...
... whose cars have challenged and
conquered the might of Formula 1 teams...
... in spite of all the years of experience
and development behind them.
But it's a sad end to this dramatic season
of battles for the championship.
The tragic, fatal accident
to the great Jean-Pierre Sarti...
... has cast a shadow over the race.
And everyone who knew him or
saw him drive will find it hard to accept...
... that his great skill
and tremendous personality is lost to us.
I'm sure the last thing either Pete Aron
or Izo Yamura would have wished...
... is for it to end this way.
Pete, do you ever get tired of the driving?
Lately, I sometimes get very tired.
You know what I mean?
Very tired.
[ENGLISH]
- Kurt, can you hear me?
- Go ahead, Sean.
At about 11 o'clock, right in the middle of that herd of wildebeest. See him?
- Now that's a good one.
- Let's go. Start out easy.
OK, Pockets.
This one must be a female, she can't make up her mind which way to go.
Tell Kurt to let her run a while, wear her down.
- Sean says give her some exercise.
- That's what we'll do.
Tell us when you want her.
Tell Kurt to take his time.
This is a mean one.
Take your time, Kurt.
Try her, Pockets, move in closer.
See what she's like.
Watch her, Pockets. Don't lose her.
The rhino got the Indian.
Swing around.
Bring the first-aid kit.
Are you trying to get a vacation?
- He hooked me good.
- He did, at that.
- Why didn't you shoot him?
- I didn't know he planned to ride with us.
- You can fix that up, Pockets.
- Big Band-Aid will do it.
- You all right?
- Want to stretch out?
Leave him here. Makes it easier for me to work. Room, please!
Tough luck.
My fault. I messed it up.
- How is it your fault?
- I was driving, wasn't I?
- The Indian could have shot him.
- You find him again, I'll shoot him.
This tourniquet isn't working.
Better get him to hospital.
- Get him into the catching truck.
- Luis.
- Come on. Give 'em a hand.
- Hold it, buddy.
Easy.
Kurt.
Calling Arusha Control.
Arusha Control speaking. Go ahead.
This is Sean Mercer.
A man's been horned by a rhino.
He's bleeding pretty badly.
Tell Dr Sanderson we'll be at Arusha hospital in about five hours. Over.
- Will do. Anything else?
- That's all. Over and out.
That hole looks very bad.
It don't look good.
After we get out of here, push on ahead to the compound.
Pick up Brandy, she'd want to be at the hospital.
You'll get there as quickly as we do.
- Arga! Where's Missy?
- In room.
No dinner. We're going into town.
The Indian bwana got hurt.
- Bad?
- I don't know yet. Get me some coffee.
Come in.
Hi, Kurt. You're back early.
- Is something wrong?
- Ja.
The Indian... Rhino gored him in the leg. He lost a lot of blood.
They are taking him into hospital now.
- Must we hurry?
- I came ahead. There's plenty of time.
Thanks for coming for me.
Help me with my zipper, it's stuck.
Come over with me.
How did it happen? Was it the same way as my father was killed?
No, we hadn't even put a rope on him.
How then?
It was my fault. I got too close.
The engine was spitting a little...
I took the chance and the Indian was the one that got hurt.
You all take chances.
That's part of the job.
I know, but I shouldn't have taken that one.
And to pull this thing up here...
I'm afraid of ripping something...
- Here you are.
- Thank you. I'll get a coat.
- How long does it take?
- As long as it takes.
You mean to tell whether a man can live or not?
Patience, my boy, patience.
Sterling virtue. I wish I had more of it.
All we can do is wait.
Just don't start climbing the walls.
Who's got a cigarette?
- It's yours?
- Thanks.
- Which one is Sean Mercer?
- I am.
- I hear you've got a job open.
- What job?
They said in town you'd be needing a man.
You're in a rush, aren't you?
Is he asking for the Indian's job?
- He's not dead yet.
- I know that.
I asked for the job because I was afraid if I waited, someone else might get it.
- You'd better get out of here.
- I'm not talking to you, I just...
Kurt, take it easy.
When a fellow's hungry... Cut it out!
Damp it! You can't whip us all.
- I can try.
- Bring your lunch.
What's going on here?
I have a patient already.
I don't want any more.
- How is he, Sandy? How's the Indian?
- Not good.
Did it have to be the Indian?
- What do you mean?
- We didn't arrange it.
You seem to take turns getting hurt.
I wish it was someone else.
You all have standard type blood that's easy to match.
- The Indian has to be different.
- He needs a transfusion?
Plasma is not doing the job.
I need whole blood.
AB negative is not very easy to find.
I'll have to call on...
- What is that for?
- I was thinking...
...you were in a little too much of a hurry.
We are talking about blood type.
Exactly.
You mean, that is your blood type?
AB negative?
That's right.
Well, it seems the Indian's luck hasn't run out.
- If you're willing...
- He is.
- I will?
- If you want that job.
I don't want anything from you, including the job.
- You refuse to give him the blood?
- I didn't say that.
But I don't like to be told.
You are going to have to ask me now.
I ask you, please.
I'm sorry, Mademoiselle, but he's going to have to ask me.
All right. I'm asking you.
This is the way you ask?
- Where do I go?
- In there. Tell the nurse...
- Wait. Tomorrow...
- He won't be going anywhere tomorrow.
When he's through with you, we'll talk about that job.
I'll think about it. Mademoiselle...
Where did you say to go?
Second door on the left.
Tell the nurse to get you ready.
- Who's he?
- I don't know. I'm glad he's here.
Doc, how long before you can tell us about the Indian?
Two or three hours. In the meantime, would you do me a favour?
- Sure, Doc.
- Get out of here.
Leave me in peace. Go have a drink.
I think the Indian will be all right.
- We'll be at the Safari Bar. Coming?
- On the way.
Safari Bar. Yes, sir, they're here.
Hello, Doc. How's the Indian?
Did he have a tough time?
Everything OK? Nothing went wrong?
- He don't say anything.
- Give him a chance and shut up!
He what? Thanks, Doc.
The Indian sat up, asked for a drink and made a pass at the nurse.
Thanks, Doc. We'll call you tomorrow.
- Youman! Another round.
- Yes, sir.
- Port!
- Port.
- Starboard!
- Starboard.
- Drop it!
- Drop it.
- Breakfast at six.
- It's a challenge we'll try to meet.
- Goodnight, everybody.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight, Brandy.
- Dead ahead, sailor.
- Aye, aye, sir!
Goodnight!
Before you go any further,
I should tell you, you're not alone.
I waited for you. The house boy was gone and it was getting late.
Hi. I had to sleep somewhere and I just picked a room.
I suppose I picked yours.
I hope you don't mind.
I don't mind... Who are you?
- Anna Maria D'Alessandro.
- What?
Anna Maria D'Alessandro.
And who are you?
I'm Sean Mercer, but...
What are you doing here?
- Trying to get some sleep.
- I don't mean that, I mean...
- You didn't expect me?
- I sure didn't.
- What's that for?
- I wanted to see if...
...if I was seeing things.
- You've been drinking a little.
No, ma'am. I've been drinking a lot.
Sean, I wanna talk to you about tomorrow morning. Don't you think?
I wanna talk to you about tomorrow...
- Is there somebody in your bed?
- Yes, there is.
What did you want to say to me?
I had something important to say.
Can't remember what it is.
- Who is she?
- I don't know.
Sean. Do you have some?
I beg your pardon, I didn't expect...
He doesn't know who she is.
- Why is she in his bed?
- He doesn't know.
- I didn't say that.
- What did you say?
- I don't know.
- That's what you said.
- What?
- "I don't know. "
If you don't know, why did you say so?
You get me mixed up, now. You said...
Look, you don't listen.
Let's start from the start...
Please, I had a long trip and I would like some sleep.
- Wouldn't you?
- I certainly would.
No, no, no. Who are you and why are you in his bed?
Why don't we leave the whole thing until tomorrow?
She's right. We can face it in the morning with clear heads.
- Yes, she is right. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Goodnight, Sean.
Thanks for the use of your room.
I didn't have much to say about it, did I?
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Anybody want one of these?
Black coffee.
Morning! Good morning, Sean.
- Jambo, Arga!
- Jambo!
What have we got for breakfast?
Bacon and eggs...
My favourite, codfish cakes.
Deep-fried with antelope fat,
I love it.
- Isn't anybody eating?
- Please, Pockets.
- Go away or shut up.
- Preferably both.
He's not human.
To drink that much and not feel it...
- We had a big night last night.
- You remember?
- Sean. I'm going on the wagon.
- Why?
I'm beginning to see things.
I thought I saw a girl in Sean's room.
You saw a girl.
That's what I said.
I thought I saw a girl.
Pockets, you did see a girl.
- I did?
- You did.
Good! Now, I don't...
- Well, who was she?
- I don't know.
- Don't start that again.
- What?
"I don't know. "
- Sean, he just said...
- Please!
Morning, everybody!
Morning, Pockets.
- Look what I found.
- What's this?
Cameras, lenses, a real professional outfit.
Your room-mate.
- Professional?
- Photographer?
Didn't a photographer write to the Indian?
- From a zoo in Switzerland.
- Basle, wasn't it?
Yeah, but... that was signed by a man, I think.
Well, go get the letter!
Sean, what does he mean,
"your room-mate"?
- The girl in my bed last night.
- Sean!
I didn't know her!
- What was she doing in your bed?
- I don't know.
Here it is. It's signed on the bottom.
A M D'Aless...
D'Alessandro.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I don't think I have met everybody.
We'd better introduce ourselves.
They call me Pockets.
They tell me we met last night.
I remember you. Who wears the other half of your pyjamas?
I do. My name is Kurt Mueller.
I know you. I covered the Le Mans race three years ago.
You should have won.
That crash... Too bad.
I don't know... He walked away from it.
I'm Luis Francisco García López.
I don't wear pyjamas.
And this is our boss,
Miss Delacourt. We call her Brandy.
How do you do?
I'm not really their boss.
They were my father's friends.
Now we all work together.
I know of your father.
One doesn't work at the zoo long without hearing of Frenchy Delacourt.
Kurt, Luis, will you help me to check the motor on the truck?
Yes, boss.
- Will you have some breakfast?
- Thank you. Just coffee.
- Just coffee. Codfish cakes?
- No, thank you.
Miss... D'Alessander?
- D'Alessandro. "Dallas" is easier.
- Thank you.
- Did you sign this letter?
- Yes, of course. Why?
Because A M D'Alessandro sounds like a man.
You mean because I'm a girl,
I can't do the job?
I mean we've got trouble enough.
Why not find out what kind of girl I am before deciding?
- I wish I had the time...
- What about Miss Delacourt?
- She goes out with you.
- She was born and raised here.
She can drive as well as anyone here, except Kurt.
She can shoot a gun as well as anyone, except the Indian.
- Can you handle a gun?
- No.
Have you ever been hunting?
- Have you ever been to Africa?
- No...
Well, I'm sorry, Dallas, about the misunderstanding.
We're short-handed, there isn't time to...
...take care of an amateur?
That's what I was going to say.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm sorry, too.
I hate to do this.
I would prefer that you wanted me.
Here is a letter from the director of the zoo.
I have a slight premonition the boom is about to be lowered.
That zoo will buy most of your animals this season.
And they want pictures of the catchings.
The boom has been lowered.
How long will it take to get your pictures?
As long as it takes to catch your animals. I'm ready when you are.
That's a funny-looking work outfit, but suit yourself. We're ready now.
- You won't give me five minutes?
- I can wait a few minutes.
- Thank you. I'll be right back.
- I can catch up with you, Sean.
What is it?
Did I say something wrong?
- I don't know.
- Nobody knows anything.
- Where are we going today?
- Manyara, I guess.
Are you gonna carry her stuff?
Don't start in by spoiling her.
Yes, bwana.
- Jambo!
- Jambo!
- All set, Brandy?
- All set.
Let's get under way.
Pockets. Don't wait all day for her.
Yes, bwana! Yes!
- Dallas, let's go!
- I'll be right out!
Take my stuff, will you?
All aboard!
I'm coming!
- Hi.
- I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
Aren't we going? Let's go!
- Where are we going today?
- Yeah.
I said... Look out!
I didn't see that darned thing!
- How does the ground seem to you?
- Could be better.
- Some gullies over there.
- Yeah.
If we get after a good one, stick around and hold him if I miss the first time.
Will do.
- Give me that pad.
- Is it OK if I stand back there?
Stay inside, that ground's rough.
I'll be all right. I like to be where I can move around.
You'll move around all right.
- What did you say?
- I told them to take care of you.
- Tell them I can take care of myself.
- OK...
Maybe.
Luis. Handle the pole.
Pockets, you pick me a big one and I'll make you eat it!
Yes, bwana. I'll be very careful.
Start out easy.
Why don't they catch the big ones?
The last one tried to get into Sean's lap.
Pockets thought he was coming through the windshield and hit an ant-heap.
Take this one, Pockets!
Tell Kurt to let that one go.
The noose slipped.
Herding car... Let him go.
Sean's having noose trouble.
- Was that giraffe to your liking, bwana?
- Just get another one the same size.
- What happened?
- What?
- What happened?
- Nothing yet.
Knock on it!
Pockets!
You'd better stay there!
Take this one.
Get ready to shake hands with him!
All right...
Slow down easy! Easy!
Slow down easy!
Come on, hurry it up!
She's a handful of trouble.
- Get enough room to move around?
- Oh, shut up!
All right.
- Well, how is it?
- Terrible. I feel sore all over.
The best thing for you now is a good hot bath. Come on.
- Thanks, Pockets.
- I'll put your things in the main building.
Brandy... I just want to say something.
You might not think so, but I had a great day.
Only, I made a fool of myself.
I'm sorry, I apologise to all of you.
I would like to stay, if you'll let me, but I don't want to force you, so...
...just forget about the letter I showed you.
If you want me to go, just tell me. I'll go.
Thanks for listening.
Well, gentlemen.
Who's going to tell her to go?
Rhino, elephants, buffalo...
...and a greenhorn.
Well, if that's the way you want it.
Mamma mia!
Help!
Help!
Stand perfectly still. Don't move.
- I think I can save you.
- Thank you!
Get back! Back!
- Thank you!
- OK. Get back!
- What the?
- What's going on here?
What's this Clyde Beatty routine?
What's he doing to you, Sonya?
Poking a chair at you!
Come on, get out.
You don't belong here anyway!
Here, that's my girl.
Pockets, aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Dallas screamed,
I ran in, saw the cheetah...
It looked too good to pass up, so I thought I...
- I was wrong.
- I think you're right.
- And stay out of here!
- Yes, ma'am.
Hi, Sonya.
Oh, nice!
- Shall I give you a hand?
- I just want to file these letters.
- Why don't you join the fun?
- I don't belong in there.
I've had all the fun
I can take for one day.
I've had bangs and bumps on every part of my body, from...
...from bottom to top.
And I had a bath with a cheetah and three men.
So I think I'll just sit for a while.
About not belonging...
They decided that if you want to stay, it's all right.
I'm glad of that, because...
You said "they".
Did you vote against me?
I told you I thought you'd be a damned nuisance.
Yeah, you did. And I was today, wasn't I?
You were. But at least you knew it.
Nice speech, but I don't think you can talk your way out of it again.
- Hi. Care for some company?
- Yes, why not?
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't.
We were rough on you today.
- I had it coming.
- Would you like a drink?
- Just sit down and talk to me.
- Thank you, Sonya.
What'll we talk about?
My favourite subject?
- What?
- Me.
All right. We'll talk about you.
I noticed today that when everybody was wrestling with the giraffe, you were just sitting in the car, laughing. Why?
Because the giraffe was out there.
- Why?
- The giraffe has spots.
The zebra has stripes... and the lion is all one colour.
What are you talking about?
Dallas, any animal that has spots, stripes, or is one colour, any colour, I don't go near.
- You don't like animals.
- I like animals, I'm just scared of 'em.
But, Pockets, you drove right in with all these giraffes around.
- What colour is a giraffe?
- Mostly yellow.
- What colour is a New York cab?
- Mostly yellow.
I drove a cab in Brooklyn. I pretend it's rush hour in Flatbush and...
...in I go.
You people, you're all crazy!
Just gives me a chance to do some of my old jokes.
You said you'd had a great day.
What was it that you liked?
Everything. The car going so fast, the animals running...
It seems...
...a great way to make a living.
Well, crazy, but...
Pockets, tell me about things here.
Who are these men?
Where have they come from?
Well... You know about Brandy.
And Kurt. Let's see...
Luis, he's Mexican.
He started out as a bullfighter.
He told us he was pretty good.
I never saw him.
- Now, there's the Indian...
- The man who wrote to me.
Mister... Little Wolf.
Little Wolf! Wait till you meet him.
His folks didn't know what they had when they called him Little Wolf.
- The Indian and I take care of Sean.
- Take care of him? How?
Sean's Irish and he gets mad.
If he takes his mad out on us, nobody gets hurt. We don't mind.
- Pockets, why he doesn't like women?
- Why doesn't he like?
Dallas, I warn you, you are labouring under a gross misapprehension...
- But why doesn't he like women?
- He thinks they're trouble.
Well, they are, but who made him think so?
Well, that's a long story.
- He almost got married once.
- Well, that's possible.
He brought her here for a visit.
She hated the place, the animals, everything and everybody.
She tried to get Sean to leave.
One day, she got on her broom and...
...just left town.
She was a fool.
You like it here, don't you?
Yeah, I like it.
I'm liable to like it too much.
Sean's got a way of...
You sure got it in a hurry, didn't you?
Pockets, tell me about him.
How does he treat you?
- You saw us all day.
- That was working.
You were with him a few minutes ago.
Was he nice to you?
No, he wasn't.
Well, lady, could be that you're in.
- What do you mean?
- I mean that's good.
If he were nice to you, you wouldn't have a prayer.
Pockets, will you speak English?
- Bad is good, good is bad, I...
- OK, look...
If a man falls for a woman, and gets his fingers burned, so he won't be singed again, what does he do?
I don't know. Tell me.
If he doesn't like you, he doesn't care and he can be nice to you.
But if he does like you, he doesn't want to get in any deeper.
So he acts mean. The more he likes you, the meaner he acts.
- Doesn't that make sense?
- No.
Let's try a different way.
If you were me, what would you do?
If I were you, Dallas, I...
No, you wouldn't want me to answer that.
Pockets, make sense! What shall I do?
- Now you're making sense.
- What?
You said, "What shall I do?" That's it.
You're the one that has to do it. He won't.
- That's simple, that I can understand.
- You know, I think you do.
Come on. We've settled everything, let's get a drink.
Dallas, one thing, please, don't make him too mean.
- Why?
- I told you. He takes it out on me!
What's so funny?
We were talking about that big giraffe you picked last year.
What a mess!
- He stepped over Sean.
- Landed on the hood.
After all that trouble catching him, we had to let him go two months later.
- Why?
- We couldn't get him to Mombasa.
His neck was too long for the railroad tunnel.
- Dallas, do you want a drink?
- No, thank you.
- E Flat.
- What?
E Flat.
- I told you, E Flat.
- You'd better be good.
At least I played it with both hands.
Arusha Control calling...
Arusha Control calling 505.
Do you read me? Over.
This is 505. We read you, over.
I have a transmission for you from Dr Sanderson. Go ahead.
Hello 505. Can you hear me? Over.
Loud and clear, Sandy, go ahead.
Sean, you can have the Indian back in three or four days.
I wish it was sooner. My nurses are all worn out, dodging him.
That's good for 'em!
The exercise'll keep 'em thin.
If that Frenchman's up and around,
I'd like to talk to him. Over.
The Frenchman?
Didn't he come to your place?
He sure did not.
He left here early this morning, with £ 15 he borrowed from the Indian.
- Where'd the Indian get £15?
- Borrowed it from me.
Did the Frenchman say what he was using the money for?
No, just borrowed it and took off.
Over.
I guess that's that.
Put the £15 on our bill, Doc.
Tell the Indian we're not sure he's worth it.
I've already done both those things.
Over and out.
- That's good news.
- Three or four days.
The Frenchman took off.
Too bad, we could've used him.
Better to work short-handed than with the wrong kind of man.
How do you know he was the wrong kind?
Didn't you hear it over the radio?
He took £15 from the Indian for saving his life.
What kind of a man would do that?
- Lafayette is coming.
- What are you talking about?
The French blood bank just turned in the gate.
- Hi.
- Hello.
The Indian said to tell you he'd be back in a few days.
- We talked to the doctor.
- Did he tell you I was coming?
He said you borrowed £15 from the Indian.
And he said he hadn't seen you since.
- You thought I was going to skip out?
- You could have.
I've got something to do first.
Do you always carry that chip on your shoulder?
That depends. I needed the money to get my rifle from the gunsmith.
Without a rifle
I couldn't be much good to you.
Question is, are you worth anything with it?
Why don't you try me and see?
Kurt is a pretty good shot.
Would you like to shoot against him?
I'd like that.
- Bring your gun down to the range.
- I'd like to go.
Me, too. Would an audience bother you?
If it does, he won't be much use to us.
- It won't make any difference.
- Hop in.
- Hey, where are you going? Wait!
- Dallas, come on!
All right.
Kurt, take the first bottle on the right.
And you... What is your name, anyway?
- Charles Maurey.
- Chalmo?
- Charles Maurey.
- Never mind. Chips will do.
You take the second one and then alternate. Ready?
Go ahead.
There go my deposits!
Now shoot what's left of 'em.
That's pretty fair shooting.
- He's faster than I am.
- A little.
Reload, Chip.
We'll see how fast you really are.
Well, it looks like you're going to work.
I still have something to do.
May I have your gun, please?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
You still want me now?
You got the job.
OK.
But you've got a strange way of asking for it.
- Kurt.
- Go ahead, Sean.
Our motor's a little hot.
We're going to get some water.
- Find a place in the shade and wait.
- OK, we'll be waiting for you.
- Holy smoke! What on earth is this?
- It's a well, a water-hole.
It belongs to the Masai tribe.
Nobody knows who built it or how old it is. 2,000 years maybe.
You see how they raise the water to the cattle.
Funny thing, they'll work all day getting that water up.
But when it comes to repairs, they won't touch it.
They hire another tribe to do the work.
They're cattlemen. Too proud to dig.
Can't you get any more speed out of this thing?
Let's go, Pockets!
Oh, nuts! Don't slow down, pass me the line.
Come on, hurry it up!
Some day, Pockets,
I'm gonna wring your neck!
Not today, bwana, not today!
Just shut up and drive!
We'd better get this one or else he'll be awful mad!
The Lone Ranger rides again! Yahoo!
If he misses again, stick your fingers in your ears.
Slow down easy! Easy!
Hold him! Let me see something!
Hang on to him!
Open the door!
Kurt, get out of there. He's hard to hold.
Come on out! Get the hell out, will you!
Get up!
Get him up!
I thought he was going to take you clear to Arusha!
- You got another cage?
- No, thank you!
Let's break out the beer.
Cheeky!
Chewy!
- Bring him over here.
- OK.
He knows the way.
Come on!
See how he likes it?
- Want some?
- Brandy!
- Good morning.
- Morning.
I really twisted this thing yesterday.
Yeah.
What's the matter? You look liverish.
Too much sun?
Sean, how old is Brandy?
She's around... Let's see, she was 17...
Have you had a close look at her lately?
Holy smoke! She's all grown up.
I noticed that the other night when I was zipping up her dress.
- When you what?
- Zipping her dress.
All of a sudden,
I stopped thinking of her as a kid.
- You did?
- I did.
That Frenchman isn't looking at her like she was a child.
Anybody with two eyes can see that.
That's why you're green around the gills!
Spring comes to the bushveld and the bucks start fighting.
- So what?
- So...
I can't answer that. But don't let it gum up the work around here.
I won't. But I'm not going to give him a free hand, either.
This is going to be great.
The Indian's knocked out, we're stuck with a woman photographer, now you break out in monkey bites.
- And we're a month behind already!
- So what?
So don't give him a free hand.
Come on!
Hey! It's the Indian!
- Welcome back, Little Wolf!
- We've missed you!
- Don't spoil him.
- Get the stretcher.
- Comment ça va?
- Frenchie, you've got good blood.
- We're blood brothers.
- Not till I give you some back.
It's like carrying an elephant!
Indian, this is
Signorina Anna Maria D'Alessandro.
- Molto piacere, signorina!
- Piacere!
- Where are you taking me?
- Bed. You're going to stay there.
- Pockets stood in the chair.
- No kidding!
All right, clear out.
Let him get some sleep.
- 'Night.
- Thanks, boys.
- Brought you some water.
- I've had that for days.
- Maybe this'll help.
- That's more like it.
Bring me up to date.
What's happened since I've been gone?
Frenchman's working out pretty good.
Quick. Pretty fair shot.
- Better than I am?
- Just as good. Moves fast.
Go on.
- We got a giraffe and a zebra.
- Go on.
The Frenchman and Kurt got a thing going about Brandy.
- Well, good for Brandy! Go on.
- What do you mean, "go on"?
That Italian import out there.
Who does she belong to?
That Italian import out there belongs to the Basle zoo.
That's A M D'Alessandro. Next time you write to a photographer, check what the initials mean.
- How come you let her stay?
- I had no choice.
- You haven't answered my question.
- What question?
- Who does she belong to?
- Oh, Indian!
If you need anything, holler.
I'll leave my door open.
Sean.
What about rhino?
They say there's plenty of them around Longido.
- Don't do it.
- Why?
Let 'em alone.
First, it was that Belgian kid.
Then Brandy's father and then me.
- This was pretty close.
- Too close.
I'm beginning to think we got the jinx on us about rhino.
- That's just because you got horned.
- No, it isn't.
Sure, I'm scared of 'em.
So is anybody with any sense.
You're right, there.
So just for this season, let 'em alone.
Well, we'll wait till we fill the other orders and then...
Don't lose any sleep over it for a while. Goodnight.
'Night.
You didn't waste any time, giving the Frenchman competition.
Competition? She was kissing
Uncle Kurt for giving her a present.
Has she thanked Uncle Kurt that way before?
- No, she hasn't.
- Some present! What was it?
Oh, nothing.
One of those things women wear, with laces on it and some stuff around...
What business is it of yours?
The Frenchman was watching.
You got him worried, anyway.
- What's next?
- I was thinking of buffalo.
Got an order for three.
A male and a pair of young ones.
Semanjaro might be good.
I hear they are moving through there.
Could be all right.
Semanjaro's good country for a lot of stuff we need.
Ought to be good, because it's so dry.
- Indian, do you like travelling?
- Sure, if I don't have to walk.
Tell Arga to get the stuff ready.
We'll go tomorrow.
- Enough for four or five days?
- That ought to do it.
Dallas, no trunk.
While I'm thinking about it, no red shirt like you had on the first day.
Why?
Some people say animals are colour-blind, but I don't agree.
- I had a bull chase me once.
- Really?
Sure it wasn't the other way round?
- Hi, Stan.
- How are you? Good?
Hello, Stan.
- What happened?
- She was a wild one, a real rogue.
Nearly killed a native three nights ago.
You can see what she started last night.
The family got out in time.
I had to shoot her.
- Can we help?
- Have you a radio set?
Could you tell headquarters
I'll stand by until they arrive?
- Sure.
- Thank you.
A calf. Did you know she had a calf?
- Not until now.
- Poor baby.
That's too bad.
What?
Dallas! Watch out!
- That thing can hurt you.
- He's not afraid.
You ought to be afraid of him.
Well, Stan. It's up to you.
I don't envy you your job.
We'll go on ahead.
I'll get your message to headquarters.
- Come, Dallas.
- Let's get out of here.
- I don't want to watch it.
- Watch what?
- It's the only way.
- What are you talking about?
That poor little fellow hasn't been weaned yet.
He's hungry, that's why he isn't afraid.
In a couple of days, with no food, he won't make it.
Lions and hyenas...
Better to get it over quick.
- You're going to shoot him?
- I'm not, Stan's the game ranger.
- That's my job.
- It's not a nice job.
- Come on, Dallas.
- I won't come!
I won't come unless you take him.
He's small, we've got plenty of room.
- How will you feed him?
- We'll find a way.
If he's hungry, he'll eat. Shoot him and you'll have to shoot me, too.
Don't tempt me!
You know, Sean, there are lots of goats around here.
- Goats!
- Goat milk is very nourishing.
- You see!
- How many goats to fill him up?
- What's a few goats?
- How will you get the milk into him?
Posho would be good.
- Mealie flour with milk.
- Like baby formula.
What are you grinning about?
Put your two cents' worth in, Indian.
- I was thinking...
- He's thinking you're gonna lose.
- I am, am I? And you're all for it?
- That's it, bwana.
Fine. You go get the goats,
I'll go ahead and make camp.
All you have to do is get the goats and an elephant into the cars.
In your spare time, figure how to get the milk into the elephant.
I'm going on to camp.
See you there, if you ever make it.
Well? What do we do?
First, we take up a collection for the United Elephant Fund: $2 each.
I'll negotiate for the goats while you get 'em all in the cars.
That's it! That's it!
Everybody contributes. See you later.
- You missed a lot of fun.
- Getting the elephant into the car?
That was easy.
Trouble was with the goats.
- Elephants and goats don't mix.
- How about the elephant?
Dallas climbed into the car and he followed. Look.
Come, Tembo!
Take him out of here while we get some milk.
He's getting hungry.
Brandy, find me some pails to put some milk in, ja?
OK, Kurt.
Well, boys. Let's unload the goats.
Hey! Get them, boys!
I'll get this one right here!
Tembo! Come back!
Now, get him over here.
Come on. Get him out of here!
Think this is a mess?
Wait till they milk 'em!
It won't be easy!
Quiet, Tembo.
- Pockets! What are you trying to do?
- I'm trying to milk this goat.
That's the wrong kind of goat. It's a ram!
Come on, I'll show you. Turn around.
- That's the way you do it?
- That's the way.
Quiet, Tembo.
They're getting the milk for you.
Now, hold it quiet, so I can...
Stand still, baby. Good...
- That doesn't get us anywhere.
- We are just wasting milk.
- A goat only gives so much a day.
- He must eat!
Don't look at me!
Feeding him is up to you people.
So start thinking.
Wait, if we take a radiator hose and shove it down...
...take a radiator hose and shove it down his throat.
- Then pour the milk in?
- You'll strangle him.
Maybe if we cut a hole in the bottom of a bucket.
Yeah, but it's still...
Oh, shut up!
He still has to swallow, now he just chokes.
I seem to remember you started all this.
- Me?
- Yeah.
- You're confused. I just went along.
- Well, think of something!
I'm trying. If he'd shut up for a minute,
I might be able to...
Hey, he's not yelling.
That's the way, Tembo. Easy!
Yes. Oh, that's good!
Wonderful!
Yes, Tembo. Here!
Yes... No, stop it.
That's good!
It's easy. I just thought,
"How do you feed a baby?"
They never begin by pouring stuff into them out of a bucket.
Here! Here, Tembo.
Oh, that's nice!
We ought to try Longido.
Seven Sisters is on the way.
We might find them there.
- Hi, Brandy.
- Hi.
Come on. Let's see which one has to go to work.
Go on, Chips. Take a straw.
I don't understand. What is this for?
Oh, I forgot.
I'm going to the river to take a bath.
I can't carry a gun and take a bath, too, so someone has to come with me - whoever gets the short straw!
- Not with this leg, Brandy.
- OK.
We've been doing this since she's been this high.
- I have the short straw, Brandy.
- Let's go.
Sean, tell me something.
When we all drew straws to see who'd go with Brandy, you didn't have a short straw.
- I know it.
- Why did you say you did?
Didn't you tell me you'd discovered that Brandy was all grown up?
That Frenchman doesn't look at her like she's a schoolgirl.
- And I'm not so sure about Pockets.
- Three of us.
So I figured I'd better be the one.
I still think of her as a kid.
All right, Papa.
Can I give you a little warning?
It isn't exactly a fatherly gleam in your eye when you look at Dallas.
- Oh, stop it!
- Don't act innocent with me.
Do you want me to answer this letter from the San Diego zoo?
- All right, I'll do it.
- Do what?
Answer the letter from the San Diego zoo.
Oh, sure!
I've run out of cigarettes.
I'll get some in my tent.
- Hey, Pockets!
- Hi!
- I thought you'd turned in.
- Got a minute?
Did Sean have anything more to say about the baby elephant?
He didn't want to see it shot any more than you did.
- Where is it?
- It's a he, Pockets.
I've been mixed up once before today.
He's tied up over there, under the trees. He's asleep.
Don't miss his two o'clock feeding.
He'll start squalling.
Sean wouldn't like that!
And you can't walk the floor with him, either!
By the way, how are you doing with the big bwana?
I don't know. You heard him today.
He would like to shoot me, he said.
I know. I thought it was a good sign.
Good sign! If he really gets to like me, I'm in danger!
Remember, he won't start anything.
You're gonna have to do it! Ciao!
Ciao.
Well...
Now is as good a time as any!
All right, see you in the morning.
- Hi, Kurt.
- 'Night, Dallas.
Watch it, Papa.
- Hi, Sean.
- Hello, Dallas.
I wanted to thank you for letting me keep the elephant.
Why me? There were a lot of other people on your side. Thank them.
Well, I'm sorry there was so much trouble about the goats and...
That couldn't be helped.
Pockets trying to milk that ram made it worthwhile!
- Dallas, will you have a drink?
- No, thank you.
This is the first time you've been nice to me.
I was almost afraid to come in here.
Well, why did you come?
- I wanted to ask you a question.
- Go ahead.
Sean...
- How do you like to kiss?
- How do I like to kiss?
- That's what I said.
- What are you talking about?
The kiss. You know the kiss.
How do you like it? Slow? Quick?
Do you like to kiss the girl, or the girl to kiss you?
- That's silly!
- Silly?
I ask how you like to kiss, and you say it's silly?
- Have you never been kissed before?
- Of course I have.
Then why do you say it's silly?
It's silly to stand here and talk about it.
Of course it's silly to talk about it.
Let's do it. I'll show you.
You like this?
- There's a lot of people...
- Or slow, like this?
I think you like slow better.
Wanna try again to make sure?
Dallas, I've taken about all of this I'm gonna take.
What are you going to do?
Sean, I was... I beg your pardon.
We ought to be in a railroad station, then more people could come in.
- Sorry. I broke something up, didn't I?
- You managed. What do you want?
I was talking to Saidi.
He saw leopard tracks by the river.
- Big?
- You know the boys.
- It's the next thing to an elephant.
- We need a big one.
Well, I suppose we'd better go talk to him.
- I'm sorry, Dallas.
- It's all right.
I mean...
Dallas, just out of curiosity...
- How did you get him started?
- I asked him how he liked to kiss.
- You just asked him...
... how he likes to kiss.
And you were just finding out when I...
If I ever get a problem, may I come to you?
- Pockets!
- Yes, bwana.
Bring him in a little!
Watch it, Pockets!
- Bring us another head rope!
- All right!
Look out, he's loose!
All right, let's go! Don't lose me!
Our insurance rate just went up.
Drop that thing off of there!
Don't give him time to rest!
Lay it on! Over here!
Take the door, Kurt.
- All right, turn him loose!
- He's loose!
Take it off.
He's caught. Keep the rope tight.
Push him from behind, Luis.
All set.
The easiest one we ever got.
Well, we're stuck.
- I'll take the cable over.
- OK.
Look out, Kurt!
Thank you!
All right, Pockets. Take her away!
You know, this afternoon...
I don't like crocodiles, especially when I'm in the water.
Anyway... Thanks again.
- A la tienne, mon pote.
- Prost!
I need some help.
The baby leopard is not eating good.
I'll get some milk and eggs.
Our girl looks pretty good tonight.
I'll flip you to see who goes with her.
Let's go together. I don't trust you.
Right, then give me my shilling back.
- Kurt, come here a minute.
- What's up?
- Somebody left the ostrich pen open.
- Here we go again!
Why don't you catch him, Kurt?
I'd better let the boys do it.
Hey! Let the females go! Keep the male.
The girls will come back to the old man anyway.
Hold still, baby... There it is.
Pockets, got a pair of pliers?
He's got a thorn.
Easy now, easy.
She'll be better now.
Come, baby.
- Sean, look!
- What's all this?
I was taking Tembo to the bath, and I found this one.
- Aren't they nice together?
- No.
- They can play together.
- It takes 20 goats...
Sean, don't speak...
- Listen first, don't speak!
- Why not?
- Don't make a fool of yourself.
- I'm a fool?
- Not yet. Just if you don't listen.
- Well, I'm listening.
I hired an African boy.
He's going to buy more goats.
He'll milk them and take care of Tembo and his friend. No trouble.
- Aren't you glad you're not a fool?
- Dallas...
Yes, Sean?
Aw, hell!
Come on, baby. Let's have a bath.
You certainly won that one, bwana.
Some day, Pockets. Some day...
Here...
It's good!
Come, baby, come!
- Take a look, bwana.
- What?
It's worth your while.
Funny how good she is with animals.
She could even do it to me!
You could use it.
OK. That's enough!
Come, baby!
- Hi, Pockets.
- Hi, Dallas.
What are you doing out here, all by yourself?
I don't know...
You said that if you had a problem, you would come to me.
- Have you got one now?
- A problem? What about?
- Brandy?
- Brandy...
Aren't you in love with her?
Are you nuts? Me in love with Brandy?
That's the most...
- How did you know?
- The way you look at her.
- A woman can tell.
- She can, huh?
Then why didn't she notice it?
- Probably she has. How do you know?
- She never did anything about it.
So, as you told me, you've got to do it.
That's fine, but what do I do?
I can't ask her how she likes to kiss, that's your stuff.
Dallas, what do I do?
Well... Did you ever dance with her?
- I don't remember.
- Do you know how to dance?
- As well as they can?
- Easy!
Come on, we'll show them!
I didn't know you could dance like that!
Go ahead, Pockets. Show her!
- Dallas?
- Yes?
- E occupata?
- Vengo!
- You've got visitors.
- Visitors?
- From the village. Can't you hear?
- I wondered about the singing.
They've made a song for you and the elephants.
Really! How nice!
I'll come in a moment.
- What are they going to do?
- It's just a Warusha ceremony.
Hi, Sean.
What's the matter?
Sean, please help me! Sean!
We'd better go along and see they don't get too enthusiastic.
It's not funny. They want to shave my hair and take my clothes off!
- There was a man there.
- He doesn't speak English!
You're now a member of the Warusha tribe.
They've given you a name:
Mother of Elephants, Mama Tembo.
You're supposed to dance with them.
- Roast beef! My favourite!
- Everything's your favourite.
- Arga, have you some red wine?
- Beer for me, please.
- Where's Mama Tembo?
- In her room.
The new member of the Warusha is not coming to dinner.
She's been in the tub for hours, scrubbing all the paint off.
- That stuff works like a dye.
- She says she has no skin left.
It was mean not telling her what she was getting into.
- What do Italians like? Red wine?
- Any kind.
- Get yourself another bottle.
- Arga! Another one.
- Who is it?
- Sean. Are you decent?
- No, don't come in, please!
- Cover up, I'm coming.
Hello, Sonya. She's taken quite...
- Oh, brother!
- You make me mad!
When I look nice, you ignore me.
And now with this stuff on my face...
- You look all right.
- Oh, phooey!
- All right, you look terrible.
- So why don't you go away?
- How do you feel?
- I hurt.
I scrubbed and scrubbed.
I almost took my skin off!
- It gave you a good colour.
- How can you tell?
- I brought you a drink.
- Why?
Well, I don't know, the way you're acting.
But you were great today.
It meant a lot to that Warusha tribe.
Now they say Mama Tembo is rafiki, which means friend.
Thank you.
And they also say that you're mbali mbali.
If that means "covered with cold cream" they are right.
- It means you're different.
- Yes, nice and greasy.
- Quit squawking.
- Well, look at me!
I am.
Come here!
You are a little slippery!
Wipe it off and we'll try again.
- I'm sorry.
- Women and their contraptions!
Now, you stop squawking.
Come and get it!
I brought you your dinner.
Now, Sean!
Sean, I didn't mean to do it!
Work 'em out onto the flats.
Sean says move 'em out onto the flats.
Make sure they know that's where you want them.
- Let me know when you've picked one.
- I'm looking for one with blue eyes.
To the right, that bunch over to the right.
Where he goes, we go.
Hang on!
Where are you hurt? Easy, take it easy.
Shoulder?
- Just a dislocated shoulder.
- Just dislocated, huh?
I think she's right.
Hold still, I'll fix it.
- Better?
- Yes, great.
Let me have some of this water.
OK, Chip? OK?
My leg's hurt.
Pull him out of there.
Let's stand him up.
Put your weight on your leg.
Try. That's fine.
- It's not broken. It's all right.
- Get him out here and clean him up.
I'll take a look at this car.
Pretty lucky. We can tow this in behind the green truck.
- We sure were lucky this afternoon.
- Yeah, when that car went over...
- Well, you never know, do you?
- Know what?
- Women.
- What?
- Or what they'll do.
- What do you mean?
Brandy! When the jeep flipped.
I'd have sworn she was in love with one of those two Romeos.
- Well, isn't she?
- She sure didn't act like it.
I always thought... She didn't act like she was in love, did she?
- Not to my way of thinking.
- Nor to mine, either.
- Rough trip?
- We never missed a bump.
- What happened?
- They flipped the herding car.
- Did they wreck it?
- It's OK.
They're going to be OK, too.
Need any help?
- We'll get cleaned up.
- I need a drink.
Let's get unloaded.
Pockets, give us a hand with the wildebeest.
You know animals don't like me.
I won't be any good to you.
- You can get in their way.
- Sean!
You told me I wasn't going to fuss with the animals!
All right, Sean.
He's hooked.
Here, Pockets, take this line...
What are you doing up there?
If he were up here, I'd be down there.
Take this line.
Pull him out when we open this door.
And keep the slack out of it, so he won't get hurt.
Ready, Pockets? Watch out!
Don't fall in with those buffalo!
Thanks for the advice, Sean!
Pockets, darling!
Are you all right?
Speak to me please, darling.
Poor sweet baby!
- Pockets! Do something, Sean!
- What's the matter with him?
He's hurt. He doesn't speak, he doesn't hear me.
Pockets, darling, please speak to me.
- Hello, Brandy.
- Are you all right?
I think so...
- No, you're not. You just say you are.
- Let me rest here a minute.
Sean, we have to get him into the house.
- I think you're right.
- Lift him carefully.
- Pockets, you'll be all right.
- It's nothing...
- What are you trying to do?
- I don't know, but I'm doing it right!
Shall I give you a hot bath?
Oh, no, Brandy... A hot bath?
- You just get his bed ready.
- Right away.
- Now?
- Now.
Thanks for coming in to patch us up.
- You'll make it.
- Dallas did a good job.
- How's the leg?
- A drink would help it.
- There's no ice. Arga!
- You're wasting your breath.
- Why?
- There isn't any ice.
- Why?
- They'll know sooner or later.
- Might as well be now.
- What do you mean?
If you want the ice, look in Brandy's room.
Go ahead! Take a look, both of you.
All right, we'll humour you.
- I think you're mean.
- They'll live through it.
- How do you feel now, darling?
- Wonderful, Brandy.
I was so frightened when you fell off that fence.
He fell off a fence.
You nearly took a leg off,
I got a dislocated shoulder...
- And he gets the ice.
- Yeah.
Come on, I'll buy you a nice warm drink.
How did you get outside?
You bad boy!
Come back in, come on!
Oh, no! Three!
What would Sean say? I can't tell him.
- Tell him what?
- This one.
What's so unusual?
No... No! How did this happen?
It must have happened when I was asleep!
- What do we do?
- How should I know?
By gosh, we got another one.
We're running an elephant nursery.
Mother!
That means that he can stay.
Well... You won another one!
Come on, baby. Let's go!
Come, baby, come!
Come in, don't be afraid!
Have you fellows any idea what Pockets is doing in the workshop?
He won't let anybody in, he says you promised him not to interfere.
- Another invention.
- Something for catching monkeys.
You know what he's been buying to catch monkeys?
Listen:
"840 feet of three-eighths nylon rope,
"260 feet of one-eighth airplane cable,
"80 feet of one-and-a-half
OD aluminium tubing,
"1,200 square yards of nylon fish net... "
Fish net? Must be planning to run them into the river to catch them.
Just listen to this:
"100 Ibs black powder.
- "Twenty war-surplus rockets... "
- What!
For throwing ropes from ship to ship.
Then four firing switches "to be used in missiles for second-stage boost".
Holy smoke!
Is he catching monkeys or launching them?
We'd better have a little talk with this gentleman.
Sean, I'd put out that cigarette.
- Hatari! Hatari!
- What are you talking about?
You're washed up!
Come on and get that hose!
Turn on the water. Come on, full force!
No! Don't put water on it!
You'll spoil everything.
- The place is on fire!
- What fire?
- It's just powder, it'll clear.
- Powder?
I thought you were trying to catch monkeys.
That's what I'm doing.
See, the smoke's clearing.
- What are you doing?
- Wait!
- You said you'd leave me alone.
- I didn't expect Cape Canaveral!
You promised.
This place is restricted, off limits.
- You did promise.
- Yes, I promised.
Are you gonna break your promise?
Did you set that thing off or did it go off by itself?
Did I?
Well, what happened, Sean, was...
You see...
- What?
- Well, I've heard...
I didn't feel that... You promised!
Get the roof fixed!
- Hi, Brandy.
- Hi, sweetie.
- What'll you have?
- Beer, if it's cold.
- How's that invention coming along?
- Fine!
How are you going to catch monkeys with a rocket?
He's going to scare 'em half to death, like he did me.
When they faint, we pick them up on stretchers and carry them away.
- OK!
- How can you catch them with a net?
Look, I'm not going to catch the monkeys.
I'm gonna get 500 monkeys under that net for you to catch.
Some of them have got teeth about an inch long.
- I've seen bigger.
- An inch and a half.
If I were you, I'd get some armour to stop those monkeys sinking their teeth into some part of my anatomy.
I'll be ready in a few days.
If you don't think the invention will work, forget it.
Forget that monkeys have teeth this long, just don't bother.
- Goodnight, Pockets.
- Goodnight, Brandy. Folks. Rest well.
You don't suppose, by any chance...
Problem is, you can't depend on Pockets.
It might work.
What a thing to say!
I'm not going to get my ears bitten off...
- We'd better get busy.
- Let's have a look.
Hi.
Holy Muckya!
You look like a gasoline pump!
- Can you bend down in that thing?
- Sure.
Move around?
The man from Mars.
Take me to your leader!
Give me a hand with this, Dallas.
- Do you want your door closed?
- No, I can't breathe.
There's more over here! Back! Back!
Up, up you little devils!
All we need is about 200 more.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
Thank you.
Three miles down the road, past that little duka, is a tree.
There are lots of monkeys in that tree.
At 6.30 tomorrow morning,
I'll be ready to throw a net over them.
- The rest, my friends, is up to you.
- You got them up that tree?
- Yes.
- How?
The Warushas were helpful. I gave them two cartons of your cigarettes.
That was very generous of you.
I hope they pleased them.
They would have liked filter tips...
What makes you think the monkeys will be there tomorrow?
I tied Rover and Cyclone under the tree, barking nicely when I left.
Have you got your armour ready,
King Arthur?
Sir Galahad? Black Knight, Red Knight?
And goodnight.
- Sleep tight.
- Thank you. You too... You'll need it!
- Rockets for Pockets.
- Everybody ready?
You think this'll work?
I've worked hard on this and I'm a little nervous.
I understand.
I'm going to shoot the net over the tree.
There are at least 500 monkeys there.
You worry about the monkeys, OK?
I'll be watching you.
- The tree's over there.
- Sure.
The rocket's pointing away from it. Why?
I read books.
Vectors, trajectors, centrifugal forces and stuff.
- You know what they are?
- No.
So you wouldn't understand why it points that way.
But do you know?
I suggest you get behind that tree.
I'm about to light this thing.
I'm about to get behind a tree.
When the net is over the tree, get in there fast, and get those monkeys before they get away.
It worked! Pockets, it worked!
- It did?
- All right, Luis. Get the cage truck.
Let's go get 'em!
It worked...!
It worked!
Timber!
Go get the monkeys! Come on!
- We're going great. Another box!
- We?
That's good! Get another cage!
OK, put 'em in. That's good.
OK, put 'em in. That's good.
Here comes Pockets. We'll have to tell him again about the rocket.
Well, he earned it.
- Sean?
- Yes, Pockets.
Sean, the rocket was all right, wasn't it?
As I said, nobody can ever say your inventions don't work.
Thank you, Sean.
I didn't see it. I was behind a tree.
- I had my hands over my eyes!
- I know.
- Tell me about it.
- He has, twice.
Tell me again, Sean!
The rocket went up, just like you said it'd go.
Went over that tree and took the net with it.
- Just like you said it would.
- Just like I said.
Did the monkeys get away, Sean?
- We got close to 500 of 'em caged.
- $6,000 dollars' worth.
Tell me about the smoke.
Well, I... Actually,
Kurt could see that better than I.
- What?
- Go on, tell him.
Well, there it was, the great silver rocket...
It was red and blue!
The great red and blue silver rocket, leaving a white trail...
...against the blue sky.
You never said that.
It must have been beautiful.
It was.
Sean, tell me again about the rocket.
It went just like you said it would. Gin!
I had my hands over my eyes.
- It's too bad you didn't see it.
- Tell me!
Pockets! Get me a drink, will you?
Left a white trail.
A white trail against the blue sky.
- Where's she going?
- She's taking the elephants for a swim.
Come on, baby!
Jambo!
Go get a gun and follow her, and see...
I don't think I can go fast enough, big bwana.
Come, baby. Come!
That's good!
OK, baby! Let's go!
Come on, baby!
Hi!
What did I say about leaving the compound without somebody carrying a gun?
It wouldn't do me any good to carry a gun, I can't shoot.
- It's a very short way.
- It's far enough to get you into trouble.
That "swimming pool" is a water-hole, the only one around here.
- Everything comes here to drink.
- I won't bother them.
They might bother...
- What's that?
- Keep quiet.
Well, that does it.
Some of Tembo's grandfathers are around. Here.
Keep walking.
Keep moving.
Get behind that tree and stay there.
You can come out now.
We're lucky. I think they've gone.
I was afraid you were going to have to shoot him.
Him? That was a cow.
She was trying to tell us to leave her baby alone.
She has one, you have three.
She figured you had enough.
So do I. Come on.
OK. Let's go, baby. Come!
- Just about wound up.
- I only see one order left to fill.
- That's right, Indian, the rhino.
- You're going to try them?
- You still believe in that jinx?
- I still can't walk good, but...
...I won't waste any more breath.
Do one thing to humour me.
- What's that?
- Use the power wagon for herding.
- It's slower.
- Fast enough.
And higher. A rhino can't climb into it.
I'll buy that.
- Is it working good?
- I'm the one who has to drive it.
All right. We'll use two ropes tomorrow.
Chips, you take a pole with Kurt.
We leave early so we'd better turn in.
We don't want any hangovers or fuzzy heads in the morning, Pockets!
All right, goodnight!
Pockets, tell Sean he's looking the wrong way.
You've got a visitor, right behind you!
Why don't you put the tailgate down and let him climb in?
- We'll take this one.
- Kurt, we'll take this one.
Will do.
This is a big one. Don't be in a hurry.
I'll be very careful, bwana.
You're supposed to chase him!
Tell him that!
- Move in a little, Pockets.
- Moving in.
Watch that line, Saidi!
Take a dolly around that roller bar!
Hang on! Hang on, boys!
Hang on to the son of a...
All right, Luis. He's all yours.
Lay that loop over his head, Chips.
- Kurt, pull her forward a little.
- Say when.
When!
- Stand still, there.
- Jump the other one.
Keep those ropes taut.
I'm gonna try and move him.
Loosen this up a little.
Loosen this up a little.
- Fair day's work!
- Nice going, big bwana.
- That's the end of your jinx.
- Sure looks that way.
Kick him in the backsides for old times' sake?
Don't get tangled in those ropes!
Hang on to him!
Look out! He's loose!
Well... Let's start over.
Get going again!
All right, move in a little closer.
Is that close enough?
Let's give it a try. He's tired.
Bwana, are we talking about the same animal?
Bring him in a little!
Watch it, Pockets!
Watch it, he's gonna quit on you!
Get another rope around his head!
We're all right.
Watch that line on the catching car.
Take the rope.
Unload the crate and grab those lines.
Now, pull! Yank on it!
Look out!
All right, tip him over.
They got him now!
There you are, Indian.
He won't get away!
Easy, Sean, easy! This breaks the jinx.
I'll feel a lot better when he's delivered.
- Bring in that crate.
- He's a real nice one!
- Coming in.
- You got cleaned up in a hurry.
Good to be finished, nothing to do in the morning.
We're not finished till we get those animals to Mombasa, aboard ship.
That won't take long.
Marja Singh said he'd go with them.
He's a good man.
What'll you do till next season?
I had a letter from Bandini.
He's got a new car, wants me to drive it.
I thought you quit that?
I know, but... one more time won't hurt.
I hope you don't break your neck.
- The Frenchman is coming with me.
- Oh?
We'll go to Paris.
We found out we both know a girl there.
- One girl for the two of you?
- We'll go halves.
It's a good excuse for another fight.
- What's Dallas going to do?
- I don't know.
- Do you want an opinion from me?
- Looks like I'm gonna get it anyway.
It's like you got bit by a leopard and now you see spots on everything.
I know all about that.
There's something about this girl.
I... I like her.
- What?
- I really like her.
It's gone that far?
Look, I don't know her and she doesn't know me.
I've been busy. I haven't had time.
Only three months, the whole hunting season.
- Are you pushing me?
- No! Take your time. She'll wait.
- Look, Kurt. This is serious.
- Ask her to come back next year.
She isn't very attractive.
She won't meet anybody like you...
More cracks and you won't need a racing car to break your neck.
- Let's go to town.
- I don't think you should.
You shouldn't be with her all evening.
You might say something you'll feel sorry about.
- Am I as bad as that?
- You ought to know.
- Who is it?
- Pockets.
Come on in.
Say, Dallas...
Hi, Pockets.
We're going into town...
...to celebrate. Are you ready?
I don't think I'll go,
I've got some work to do.
Dallas, this is Pockets.
What's the matter?
Isn't it going too good?
No, it's not going too good.
Probably my fault.
I messed it up a couple of times.
That didn't mean anything.
You didn't mess it up.
I didn't do it. She did it.
- Come again?
- That girl you told me about.
The one you said made him burn his fingers.
When he looks at me, when he touches me, he likes what he sees and what he feels just for...
Then she's there and I'm not there any more.
- Well, couldn't you sort of?
- No, I couldn't.
It's all over.
I don't even know if I want him any more.
I was all right until you came in.
I just couldn't stand him looking at me and wondering if I was going to be like her.
I'd rather not have him.
It just wouldn't...
Oh, please, Pockets, go away!
Well, Dallas, if there's anything
I can do to help.
Please go away, go with the others.
All aboard! Bus now leaving for 42nd Street and Arusha Square!
- Everybody here?
- Where's Dallas?
In her room. She's not coming.
Says she has work to do.
- Well!
- Well, what?
I'll see if I can get her to change her mind.
You all go on ahead,
I'll see you in town.
Holy smoke!
What have you got in the third?
- Pretty good, eh?
- Smells good, too.
- This is business.
- Has it got a sister?
Two sisters?
Dallas? It's Sean.
Come in.
What's going on here?
- Please turn the light off, Sean.
- Sure.
What's the matter?
Why aren't you going with us?
I just don't feel like it.
You've been crying.
What if I have?
Can't somebody cry if they want to?
- What are you crying about?
- Nothing, nothing.
A girl doesn't cry about nothing.
It must be something.
It's because I... I got a scrotch.
- A what?
- A scrotch, going through the bush.
- Oh, a scratch!
- Scratch or scrotch, it hurts.
- What are you doing?
- Hold still!
No wonder it hurts, the thorn is still in you.
There...
There's some iodine around here.
Never mind, just let it go.
It would be better with something on it.
You need iodine worse than I do.
- I need iodine?
- For your fingers.
- There's nothing wrong with them!
- Yes, there is!
I got all mixed up.
You don't use iodine on a burn, do you?
A burn? Make sense!
- How do you treat burned fingers?
- I guess you... put butter on them.
Yeah, then some day you'll find somebody with butter.
I don't get it. Fingers, butter...
What are you talking about?
Go away! You always come when I don't want you.
- Oh, Dallas, cut it out!
- Don't touch me! Leave me alone!
- Get out of here before I...
- OK!
Now, what the hell did I say?
First morning we can sleep, those elephants...
What a racket!
Hasn't Mama Tembo fed them this morning?
Mama Tembo has gone.
That's why they're yelling.
- "Gone"?
- She left a little while ago.
What do you mean, "left"?
- He may understand you, Pockets.
- I'll take a chance.
She has packed her bags and departed from our midst.
- She can't do that!
- I found this letter under my door.
- Behave and I'll tell you what she says.
- Well, read it.
"Dearest Pockets... " That's me.
"I can't stand goodbyes, so
I'm having Saidi drive me into town. "
You notice she doesn't write with an accent.
"Tell everybody that
I can't find words to thank them,
"that I'll never forget them, that I love them. Dallas. "
- You believe now that she's gone?
- I'm gonna stop her.
You didn't want her to go?
- Of course I didn't!
- You asked her to stay?
- I was going to ask her, but...
- But what?
- She wouldn't let me. She ran me out.
- She's smart.
- What are you going to do?
- Find her.
Arusha's a big town, if she doesn't want to be found.
- Tembo might find her.
- Get him on the scent.
- He's got a long nose!
- Hurry!
Right!
- What's this?
- She left that behind.
Make a good bandage for your fingers.
Friends! Tell the airport not to let her on a plane.
- Shall we say why?
- Say she stole something. Money.
Tell the police to watch the Nairobi road.
- How much money?
- She robbed a bank.
Chips and I will check the taxi station.
I'll go with them.
I can go places they can't.
Hurry it up, Luis.
Why bring all three?
We can only use Tembo.
Get in there, get in!
Hold it!
Come on, Tembo!
What does she do to make him move?
Come on, get in. Come on, Tembo!
Come on!
This might work!
What is that?
Look, Tembo! Look, this is Mama.
Yes, Mama!
Bwana, you remember Mama, don't you?
Come on, take a good smell now.
- Yes, it's Mama!
- It's gonna work!
Wise child that knows its own mother.
Come on, there's no room for you.
Airport? If a girl about 5' 6" tall with red hair shows up, don't let her on a plane, she robbed the Bank of England.
- Wait a minute, stop! Sean!
- Any luck?
She's not at the railroad station.
- She's been to the ticket office.
- What for?
Airline ticket, but she wasn't at the airport. She must be in town.
- Where?
- I don't know.
- Tembo doing any good?
- Not a thing.
- Do those clothes belong to Dallas?
- Sure.
He's probably smelling them, no wonder. Give them to us.
Sean, slow up.
I think he smells something.
He does smell something.
Come on, Tembo. Come on, baby.
There he goes...
He's going into Singh's. Come on.
Oh, no!
Go away!
You shouldn't have done it!
It's not... It's not fair!
I didn't want you to do this...
Why, why did you?
- Look, Dallas...
- What did you do that for?
Why didn't you just let me go?
Go away! It's all your fault.
Goodnight, Sean!
Before you go any further,
I should tell you you're not alone.
- What's your name?
- They call me Dallas.
What are you doing in my bed?
Sean, I wanna talk to you.
You know that girl Dallas we were looking for? If we wanna...
Oh, Sean.
You know that girl we were looking for this afternoon?
- She's in your bed.
- Pockets. Out.
- What's she doing in your bed?
- Get out.
We got married this afternoon!
Oh, no!
Go away! Go away, now!
Tembo, go away!
Tembo!
Go away!
- Where is the meeting?
- In the... church.
Is Quintero with them?
Yes.
Columnal Derechal
(in Spanish) Forward!
Senor Quintero...
...for three years, they have heard nothing but talk.
Now, when are we going to do something?
When are we going to get the soldiers off our necks?
Soon, my friend.
Soon. But first, we must grow strong.
In one week I go to Sonora to meet with the revolutionary council.
If I can show them the support of the people...
...and the young fighters in the hills...
...they promise that the generals sympathetic to our cause...
...will come over to our side.
The presidente will run before our strength.
Then you will be free to live as men, and not as animals.
- And what about Lobero?
- He is a bandit and a thief.
It's hard to respect the law when you feel the heel of its boot on your back.
I'm not sure that what Lobero wants from the revolution is the same as we want.
But he says he wants to help.
And he has many guns.
Do you trust him?
Only his guns.
For the revolution I would make a bargain with the devil...
...so why not with Lobero?
Let him join us. Perhaps, after we win, he will change.
Oh. It is time for me to go.
Senor Quintero.
Please, be careful, huh?
You took a big chance just coming here.
In these days, one takes a chance every time he wakes up in the morning.
Quintero! We are waiting!
It's Diego. They're all over the place.
Benito?
- Is he dead?
- He's dead.
- I told you we should have brought guns.
- Guns? What guns?
(Diego) Quintero!
It is useless to resist.
We must wait for our time.
Take this. It will help.
Somehow, I don't know how...
...we will be together, eh?
If I live.
You will live.
(Diego) Quintero!
I do not like to be kept waiting!
Look at your leader.
El palomito. The little dove who would be an eagle!
Take a good look.
You will not see him again.
This... this is who you follow, but you go nowhere.
He talks... oh, how he talks, but he does not fight.
Must we teach you again and again - to resist the president only brings death?
Will you never learn?
Tie them up.
They have done nothing.
Why make them suffer because of me?
Perhaps you are right. They do nothing on the farms. They will do nothing in prison.
We are short on rations, so why feed stupid mouths?
Lobero.
(in Spanish) Lobero.
Wake up, man. Lobero.
- It's me, Maximiliano.
- Hm?
- What happened?
- Quintero's been captured.
Argh!
The little dove is in the rathole!
I told you not to let him come.
Nobody listens to Lobero.
Now we will have to get him out.
Tomorrow.
But every time we do, we don't.
But every time we do, we don't what?
Every time we go in, we don't come back.
Two brothers I have lost, trying to get your uncle out.
He's right, Lobero.
We're going to need some help.
Need help... I have men. I have guns.
- That's not enough.
- It's not enough?
- You have a plan?
- I know someone who can help us.
Someone who can help us.
Who is this great genius, this great man?
I have never seen him. All I know is that he's a friend and his name is Chris.
And he will help us because he love us?
- No, no. For money.
- For money?
- How much money?
- American?
- American.
You have the money?
What do you think, Miguel?
- I think...
- Ah! I don't care what you think.
OK. All right.
Maximiliano...
...you go, but you better come back...
...with the cannons and the guns and the dynamite and the whole shooting match.
Hang him!
You got anything to say, stranger?
I said it all at my trial.
You didn't believe me then.
String him up! Kill the horse thief!
You, uh... you wanna know my name before you hang me?
Not particularly. Just your last words.
- I demand a re-count.
- We've been all through that before.
It was your word against the Garrett boys, three of the finest men I know...
...born and bred right here in this town.
Three of the finest liars you know?
Stealing a man's horse in this country is worse than stealing his wife.
There's been too much of this thing going on and I'm going to put a stop to it.
Horse stealing or wife stealing, Judge?
Let's get on with it.
I got some steers want brandin'.
All right, boys. Get on with it.
I'm a reasonable man, Judge.
Give him a re-count.
All right, Coley. Whatever you say.
Everybody in favour of hanging him, say "aye".
- Aye!
- Against?
No.
And who says no?
- Me.
- Just who are you to say no?
Who do you have to be to say no to a rigged court...
...stretching the neck of some poor slob?
And what would you suggest?
Well, she's just another horse.
She's nothin' special.
She... he could be anybody's.
This man says it's his, huh?
This man says it's his.
- One of them's a liar.
- You better prove I'm a liar.
- I can't do that.
- Then who can?
The horse.
It's all right with me, Judge. Take the horse out in the middle of the street.
Come on, horse.
Come on. Come on, horse.
Come to Daddy.
Come on, Billy-boy. Come on.
Billy-boy. Come on, Billy-boy.
Come on, Billy-boy.
Yeah, come on, fella.
Come on, Billy-boy. Come over here.
Come on.
Come on, Billy-boy. Come to Daddy.
That's it. Come on, Billy-boy. Come on.
Come on, fella. Come on.
Yeah, attaboy. Yeah, yeah.
(Judge) Well, that's fair and square and good enough for me. Case dismissed.
We'd better get outta here before they wise up.
(Coley) Hold it, you two!
I'm overrulin' the judge.
There's somethin' real snaky goin' on.
I know you, Chris.
A lot of people know you.
Mostly sheriffs.
That's my horse.
I want him.
And I'm gonna have him.
I'll count to three.
They'll draw on two.
One...
...two...
Let's go.
That's my horse! Let's get after them!
Is that your horse?
Nope.
Coley's the thief. Stole my horse in Dodge. Rigged faro game.
So you stole his, huh?
Yeah.
Well, that's only fair.
You didn't really have to call me a poor slob, did you?
Name's Keno.
I like that better than "poor slob".
I know you from someplace.
Fresno, Laramie, St Joe.
You ever been a lawman?
- I just got out.
- For what?
No questions.
No questions.
Hello, Chris.
It sure seems to be my day for strangers.
Oh, you were magnificent.
Both of you.
There you were, standing on the scaffold...
...alone and friendless...
...and the crowd is yelling
"Kill him! Kill him!"
But you stand there, ready to die.
Proud and defiant and unafraid.
And suddenly there's a voice.
"No."
And Chris, Chris steps forward.
As cool as the other side of the pillow.
One man against a thousand.
Chris, I'm so glad I follow you.
My cousin said to me "Find a man.
He's called Chris, and he will help you."
- Who's your cousin?
- In Mexico everyone is a cousin.
And all the cousins are in trouble now. Big trouble.
Angel Quintero has been captured.
He is our only leader.
With him we are something.
Without him we are nothing.
He's in prison. We need your help.
- Have you tried to get him out yourself?
- We have the will but not the way.
Diego, the prison comandante - he's a crazy one, and our hands are tied.
Un gato con guante no caza raton.
That's: A cat with... with mittens doesn't catch the rat.
Will you help us?
I have money.
I have lots of money.
Here, it's all yours.
- American?
It's American.
This prison, is it a big one?
It's the Cave of the Rats. It's like a fort.
I've heard of it.
I'd need help. More men.
We have the men. Quick with the guns, but slow with the brains.
Six men.
Not enough to cause suspicion, just enough to do the job.
Six men. $100 a man.
You like?
Yeah...
...I like.
- It's a deal.
- Thanks.
Oh, and Chris? Chris, can I fight with you?
Oh, it's not for the money -
I could not take it - but it's for Quintero.
Not on the basis of what you did against Keno.
Oh, but I'm young, I'm strong, I'm angry.
And I will learn.
Besides, my cousin says that seven is a lucky number for you, no?
- What's your name?
- Maximiliano Bienvenido O'Leary.
Why do you people always have such long names?
I don't know. Perhaps it's because we all have such short lives.
Well, Chris? Can I fight with you?
- Welcome, Max.
- Thank you, Chris.
Cave-in!
Cave-in!
We'll get you outta here.
We'll get you out. We'll get you out.
Hold on, we'll get you outta here.
Get him out! Get him out!
Ah!
That's great. That's gonna cost us nothin' but time and money.
I told you it might collapse.
The surface charge was too much.
You're all back and no brains, boy.
So you stick your damn advice.
The company shouldn't hire your kind.
Pick up your card and get your butt back up in the trees where you belong...
(Chris) He ain't worth killin', Cassie.
I wish I was as sure of that as you are!
(boss) You're through, you hear?
You're through!
Get the hell off of this property before I call the sheriff! Go on!
- What the hell are you doin' here?
- I'm lookin' for you.
- What's on your mind?
- I've got somethin' going.
I need ya.
- Who is this?
- Name's Keno.
This is a rough go, huh, Cassie?
Yeah.
If I hang around here much longer, I'll end up in jail.
Wouldn't you rather blow one up?
- For money or for laughs?
- About as much as you'd make in a year.
Not many laughs.
I don't work here no more.
I guess I might...
...take you up on that.
Chris, how are ya? It's good to see ya.
Long time. I'm sorry about your hat, stranger.
- Yeah, so am I.
- This is my friend, Keno.
Well, then you're no stranger. Levi.
Come on in. Get in there.
Well, sit down, sit down.
This is my...
This is my wife.
She's a good woman, but she don't like strangers, just me.
So I notice.
Kinda surprise you a little bit that I got these shots left in me?
- You didn't wait very long to fire 'em.
- I didn't have much time.
Supper's just about ready.
We're havin' beans.
- Hope you like beans. It's all we're havin'.
- Fine, fine.
Milk for the kids. No whisky.
We can't afford it.
- Land does look a little tough and dry.
- It's like jerky. Dry well don't help none.
- Why don't you dig a new one?
- No time. I gotta feed the family first.
Would $100 help?
- What's the action?
- Prison break. In Mexico.
No, Chris.
I've packed all that in.
I do my talkin' with my...
...mouth now, mostly.
Besides, I'm too old.
It's time for a-settin' and a-lookin'.
Most of the time, anyway.
$100 would dig you a new well.
Buy you a lot of staples.
I ain't as fast as I used to be.
You're probably a lot smarter.
And you look just as tough.
Well, what do you say we find out the way we used to?
One... two... three.
I think you're just bein' kind to me, Chris.
In more ways than one.
No, I've got guns.
But nobody handles a knife like you do.
- (wife) Beans, Mr Morgan?
- Beans, Mrs Morgan.
I'll think it over.
Buffalo Ben, is he? Never heard of him.
It ain't all that hard to shoot at somethin' that don't shoot back. I don't like rebs.
I think I just might shoot the buttons right off of that mangy uniform.
(Chris) Now you better get your friend to the doctor.
(man) It's just a part of the show, folks.
Just a part of the show.
Step right over here and meet God and Billy Joe Hatfield for only ten cents.
One thin dime, the tenth part of a dollar.
Yes, sir, folks.
The one and only Billy Joe...
...direct from a colossal and successful tour...
Hello, Chris.
Don't you remember me?
Slater.
It's... it's useless, Chris.
It's just about as useless as I am.
I've seen phoney acts, friend, but you're not one of 'em.
You're damn right I'm not, friend.
- Slater, this is Keno.
- Slater.
I'm a freak, Keno. I'm a half-man, half-gun.
I can't whip a six-year-old girl in a fair fight...
...but I can blow a man's eyeballs out at a hundred yards in a sandstorm.
Yes, sir, I'm a real attraction.
This is a tough way to make a livin'.
You know a better?
Better than this.
Chris, nobody ever heard of a one-armed gunny.
Not until just now.
Can we see you in town later?
Yeah.
You ain't just feelin' sorry for me?
A wife and a gaggle of kids.
So you sold out, Levi?
No, no. I bought in.
No, it takes a man my age to appreciate a real woman. She's worth it, too.
I appreciate 'em, Levi, every one I ever had. I just appreciated the hell out of 'em.
I don't think you ever met a real woman, nino.
- Except maybe your mama.
- Yeah.
Los hombres tienen que pelear, las mujeres tienen que llorar.
The... the men have to fight and the women have to cry.
I was lonely. I wanted to say something in my own language.
Why, Max, do men have to fight and women have to cry?
I don't know, Chris. It's just a saying.
Comin' out.
Oh.
I wish this was for real money.
Well, it won't be long.
$100. I've never even seen that much money before.
Sure buy a lot of watermelon.
You're about to get yourself all busted up, boy.
Your rag arm. If you weren't a cripple I'd break your back.
It was a joke, Cassie. A joke, that's all.
I don't see nobody laughin'.
Maybe it was a bad joke.
It was a bad joke. Let him go, Cassie.
(Chris) Queen bets.
- In for one.
- Yeah.
- I call.
- Yeah.
- Comin' round again. Ace with the queen.
- Here we go.
- Yeah.
- Jack, seven, ten.
May I have a word with you, Chris?
These are my friends, PJ.
Queen, ace bets one.
- Call.
- Hear you're lookin'.
- I'm lookin'.
- Well, I'm askin'.
You sure you're up to it, PJ?
Yeah, I'm up to it.
You wanna know what it is?
Well, if you're in, it's all right with me.
You wanna know the money?
Whatever you say.
There's a seat open over here, PJ.
Seven here.
(in Spanish) Hurry up. Come on.
(in Spanish) Speed it up.
Move it. Get in the wagon.
(boy) Papa! Papa!
Papa! Papa!
Hijo.
(in Spanish) Get back! Get in the wagon!
(in Spanish) Get back! Get back!
- (boy in Spanish) Leave him alone!
- (in Spanish) Get back!
(in Spanish) Diaz, go get the colonel quickly.
(in Spanish) My son, it's been such a long time.
(in Spanish) Come on, old man.
Get in the wagon!
(in Spanish) And you, boy, go to hell.
He's our prisoner. They have to go back.
I'm warning you, sir. Get out of my way.
Where do you live?
In the hills.
Have you no home?
They burned it.
Where will you go?
To find my father.
Well, maybe we can help you.
Why do you want to help me?
You ask too many questions.
- I asked only one.
- Then I will ask one.
Where will you go if not with us?
I will ride with him.
- What is your name?
- Levi Morgan. What's yours?
- Emiliano Zapata.
- I'll call you Emil.
- I'll call you Levi.
- All right.
He's the one I told you about.
There he is. The one I told you about.
Do you not know interfering with a federal guard is a prison offence?
I made a mistake. You have my apologies, Colonel.
Next time you will act differently?
You may be sure of that, Colonel.
A lot differently.
- What are you looking for here?
- Silver.
- What else?
- Gold?
Without supplies? No food or tools?
You hunt silver with a gun?
You shoot it like an animal?
No, we thought we would get our supplies here.
There is nothing here, senor.
No silver in the hills - only rebels.
I'm glad you told us that, Colonel.
If we see any rebels, we'll report them to you.
You will not stay long, senor.
Only until we get what we came for.
I trust that will be soon.
We all do, Colonel.
Una mona se vista de seda, mona se queda.
A pig without armour is still but a pig.
(in Spanish) Here comes Maximiliano!
Maximiliano! Maximiliano!
(in Spanish) Over here, Maximiliano!
I see and you see.
All the young men are hidden in the hills.
They'll come down when
Quintero is free and not before.
No, no, no. So, so, so, so, so, so.
Oh, oh, oh.
Yeah.
Thank you.
- Gracias.
- De nada.
It's Lobero.
- Is that a welcome party or a lynch party?
- With Lobero, you never can tell.
American.
Where are the cannons?
The guns? The dynamite?
Is this, these few men...
...this is what you bring to take our little dove from Diego?
- You don't understand, Lobero.
- I understand. Does he understand?
That one?
He is the leader.
I can tell. It is in the eyes.
Does he understand that he will have to fight against soldiers?
Soldiers, not Indians with little bows and arrows.
Soldiers! 10 times more than you.
20, 30 times more.
- He has a plan.
- He has a plan(?)
He also has our money, but I am the only one that has the men and the guns.
What plan? Where is this plan?
When I'm ready, I'll tell ya.
When he is ready.
Not when Lobero is ready, when he is ready!
- Well, give him a chance, Lobero.
- I do not need your advice!
All right.
I will wait.
But not for long.
Vamonosl
- Levi?
- Huh?
Will my father ever come home?
Oh, you bet he will.
- Levi?
- Hm?
Will you be my father until he comes home?
You bet I will.
- Levi?
- What?
Why is it that people always fight?
Well, someday you're gonna be an old man, just like me...
...and when you are you may get an answer to that question and if you do...
...you tell me, will ya?
You bet I will.
- Max?
- Hm?
You ever been inside the rathole?
Not yet.
Well, you will be.
- How's that?
- We gotta get the layout.
How are we going to get in?
Just ride in.
(Slater) I'm a freak. I'm a freak.
Rag man... rag arm.
I'm a freak.
Freak... freak.
Freak.
(man) Buffalo Ben, is he?
Never heard of him.
(Cassie) Rag arm... You're going to get yourself all busted up, boy.
If you weren't a cripple,
I'd break your back.
(Slater) It was a joke, Cassie.
A joke, that's all.
(Cassie) I don't see nobody laughin'.
We need water for our horses.
You must have permission.
Well, your colonel is an old friend.
I will check with the sergeant.
Permission to water horses.
Si.
The sergeant, he will talk to the colonel.
It's a nice place you've got here.
Thank you. The presidente himself gave us a commendation.
- It's a big place.
- 200 men.
Does my friend work you seven days a week?
It is hard work. But only six days.
Sunday is no work.
- Our wives come that day.
- Early, I bet, huh?
Unhappily, no, sir.
In the afternoon after church.
Some just say they are wives.
I have two.
- The prisoners' wives come too?
- Never. Seven days a week for them.
Well, have fun with both your wives.
Ah, the treasure hunters.
You are just in time.
You will talk now...
...or you will never talk again.
Who are your district leaders?
Where are your guns?
What are your orders?
With what treacherous generals do you meet?
I repeat, with what treacherous generals do you meet?
I cannot ask your forgiveness, my friends.
I can only ask it of God.
The ceremony is over.
Soon there will be another...
...and another, and another, until you learn.
Did you find your silver?
- No silver.
- Where are the rest of your men?
In the hills.
Oh, that is dangerous. The hills are full of bandits and criminals.
You will be leaving soon?
Good. I would advise it.
I have advised it before.
Yes.
Very few men have impressed me as you have, Colonel.
Lieutenant.
Did you notice anything... anything unusual?
No, sir.
That is why you are not a colonel.
They did not water their horses.
Why did they come here?
You've seen what I've seen, except in the prison.
You should be glad you didn't see it.
That's 200 of 'em.
- That's thirty to one.
- Thin odds.
What about Lobero?
You never can tell with him.
He changes like the wind.
- Without him, we might be dead.
- Even with him, we might be.
You want out? Nobody told you it would be easy. You're being paid to do a job.
I'm gonna do what I have to do, you're gonna do what you have to do.
Anybody that wants out is out.
Whoa!
When do we fight?
Ask Chris.
You.
You have looked. You have seen.
What do you wait for?
I say attack, now.
You have been paid.
Earn it. You have taken the money, but you do not deliver the goods.
What do you know of this land?
Of my people and their needs?
You are nothing but a stinking hired killer.
You say you have a plan.
What is this plan for my people?
You're not one of your people.
You are a liar and a coward.
If you move any way but backwards, then you lose that eye.
Now get outta here.
Vamonosl
Ha! Ha!
There go our troops.
Emil, are you sure this is the way?
I am sure. I think.
- There are gonna be three wagons?
- That's what I saw before.
Chris.
I don't believe him. Lobero.
- About what?
- The money.
You do not help us only because of the money.
Do you, Chris?
Like Max says, you ask too many questions.
Drop it!
- Vamonos, vamonos.
- Amigos, atras, atras.
Atras, atras.
(in Spanish) Come on! Move it!
(in Spanish) Let's go! Everybody out.
Vamonos, vamonos. Rapido, rapido.
Rapidol Vamonos.
- Vamonos, vamonos.
- Papal Papal Papal
Back in the wagon!
Come on! Get in there!
Get back in the wagon!
Come on. Come on.
(in Spanish) Come on!
(in Spanish) And you, and you, and you...
Now we got somethin' to work with.
It cuts the odds. Not much, but some.
Chris, I have 20 men. One for each rifle and each horse. They're ready to fight.
- But can they?
- Well, they're young, strong, angry...
- And they will learn, huh?
- Right.
(in Spanish) Get on the horses!
Drink.
Drink.
It is hot.
It is good for you.
You are skinny.
You could be such a fine-looking man.
You have a good face.
Did your mother never feed you?
Maybe I should fatten you up.
About last night...
Thanks.
- But of all of 'em, why you?
- I was the closest.
This uniform didn't bother you none?
Why should it?
It's dead, man.
You're wearing a shroud.
You don't know what it's like, Cassie.
Bein' lonely an' all.
People look at ya like you're some sort of animal.
Slater, you are an amateur.
You don't know what being lonely really is.
If it's conversation you're looking for, tell me how you got to be a cripple...
...and I'll tell you all about bein' black.
- Do they always cover the wagons?
- Yes.
To keep the sulphur from blowing away in the wind.
- Where do they go?
- To the railroad.
- How far?
- Two, maybe three miles.
- Every day?
- Sometimes twice.
- What's at the railroad?
- A small place.
An office for the railroad and a cantina for the federales.
(in Spanish) Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name...
- How's it goin'?
- Rough.
They wanna learn. I've tried to teach 'em.
Some of 'em could be damn good.
But we need more time.
There's no more time. Tomorrow's ladies' day at the rathole.
They'll hardly be in a fightin' mood.
Too bad Lobero isn't.
We could still use him.
I don't think you'd like him ridin' behind ya.
Gabriel.
- Just in case.
- No, Chris. We made a deal. It's yours.
When you get Quintero back, we get that back.
- Chris?
- Yeah?
Can I go with you tomorrow?
- No.
- Why not?
You're too little.
Chris?
Mm-hm?
How big do you have to be to die?
Go to bed, Emil.
You scared, reb?
No.
I am.
You just don't give a damn.
Ain't that about it, Slater?
No, you just don't believe in life after birth.
Do you?
Did once.
Now I can't even get a job to support my wife and kids.
And you think you've got troubles?
You could have been a black one-armed gunny.
You got a wife and kids?
What happened?
She found a whole man.
Well, I guess that makes her about half a woman. And you're better off, boy.
These people...
...they got you hooked.
No man gets hooked unless he wants to be hooked.
Besides, what else is there?
There's no more open land.
Mountain man is dead.
Buffalo are gone. Soon the horses'll go.
Then it'll be our turn.
You know anybody that'll be sorry to see you go?
Maybe these people'll be sorry to see us go.
What am I preachin' at you for?
I'll see you in the mornin'.
Yeah. I hope you'll see me tomorrow night too.
Lobero! Maximiliano comes.
Well, tomorrow is the day.
So, he sent you to apologise to me, uh?
He wants to beg me to help him.
He does not even know I'm here.
He would shoot me.
- He's a proud man.
- A proud man.
He is a greedy man.
Well, perhaps, in the beginning, maybe he was...
...but now... now, he feels for us.
Then let him fight for us.
I hear that he has an army.
Killers, with rifles from the federales.
It's only a few farmers.
Listen, Lobero. If it's an apology you want, I apologise.
- I beg for your help.
- Lobero, maybe we should...
What has Quintero ever done for us?
Has he made me a general?
No.
He has fancy clothes.
He makes fancy talk.
He's no more than a politico.
What will get us guns?
A little man with a funny hat...
...or $600 that you gave to a stranger?
Chris was right.
You don't have big dreams,
Lobero, only a big belly.
And the rest of you, remember tomorrow, when you're half drunk and all crazy...
...that your brothers are out there dying for you.
Maximiliano is right.
You have no big dreams.
Shh!
Shh!
My horse threw me.
My horse threw me back... there.
(in Spanish) Out! Out! Let's go! Hurry up!
(in Spanish) Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
(whispers) PJ.
(in Spanish) It's an attack!
Cassie!
Go!
Take some men. Kill Quintero, quickly.
Maximiliano. Hijo mio.
A la torrel
Keno.
No questions.
It will not be long for them now.
Well, did you find your silver?
Do not worry, Carlotta. He will not shoot us. I know this kind.
He fights for money, not for passion.
Matter of business with him.
Maybe we can make what you call...
...a deal, huh?
- Where's your hero?
- Lobero?
He was sick.
A bullet. In...
...his belly.
Emil, uh... I made this for ya.
It's really just a frog sticker, Emiliano...
...but if a man used a real one in the right way...
...he might be able to help his people one day.
- Levi?
- What?
Chris.
Chris, we're going to scatter in the hills and we're going to fight them again.
We will stalk them in the night like jaguars.
We will... we will sweep down from the mountains like hawks.
We're going to tear out their throats like wolves.
In the deserts, Chris, in the valleys, all of us, Chris...
Goodbye, Chris.
Los cobardes mueren muchas muertes.
El valiente, solo una.
Max, you must stop them, quickly.
- The money. All the money. He forgot.
- Chris! Chris!
Max!
He did not forget.
Max? What did Chris say?
He said that cowards die many deaths, the brave only one.

Marisa Castle de Joncaire
Four down, six to go. Come on!
- It's a good sound.
- Sí. Very good.
Soon big boats will land in our harbor.
Then much happiness.
- Un buen ano.
- Sí.
A man can't even have a decent siesta around here anymore.
Hacker, wait.
Please, Hacker, no more trouble.
Let go, Chica. I warned him.
I'll teach that Bart Thompson who's boss around here.
Is that it?
No, the two at the end haven't gone yet.
They must've gotten wet.
Give 'em a couple minutes more, and we'll plant 'em again.
Right.
Everybody stay away from the water.
We may have a couple of live ones down there.
Lou, get another charge ready.
How are you coming on the road, Dumpy?
Pretty slow, boss.
The native workers haven't shown up yet.
Oh, no.
What do you suppose the reason is today?
Mike Hacker.
Of course Mike Hacker.
I wonder what his sick excuse is gonna be.
What the world are you doing?
- Me? Nothing, boss.
- No, no. Not again, Dumpy.
Haven't I got enough on my hands today?
Come on, Julio, let's go.
I didn't do no harm, Senor Bart.
Honest he didn't, boss.
Yeah, well, if I had enough time,
I'd give you both a spanking.
Your father asked us to keep you away from here.
- And you know that too, Dumpy.
- Yeah, I know.
Hacker's not my father, Senor Bart.
All right, but he is your guardian, right?
And he's the island manager, which means we have to get along with him.
I just want to learn.
I know you do, son.
Ban!
There's a little outboard coming into harbor!
That fool's liable to get blown to kingdom come!
Keep that flag waving!
For Pete sakes, whoever it is is waving back.
- It's Betty!
- Go back, Betty!
- Go back, Betty!
- Go back!
Turn around! You're in restricted water!
Turn back!
- Are you all right?
- I guess so.
- I'm sorry, Betty. We tried to warn you.
- Oh, by taking a shot at me?
That was no shot.
That was a delayed-action charge.
Oh. Well, I guess that makes all the difference.
What in the world are you doing now?
I'm going down to Davy Jones's locker for my mother's portable icebox, in which I had stashed all sorts of goodies for you guys to eat, and which I intend to eat whether you're hungry or not.
Betty, wait! The water's not safe!
- Ain't love wonderful?
- What's happening?
They just dove in for a swim.
That's dangerous. There's still debris churning around down there.
Yeah.
Ain't love strange?
Okay. Just take it easy, Betty.
All right. Everybody back to work.
Chuck, take another diver and check out that channel bottom.
There's something strange down there.
The water was ice-cold.
We might have blown the lid off a subterranean river.
- Check it out, will you?
- Roger. Come on.
When I get out at the end here, Julio, you head on for home.
Don't want you to get into any trouble, now, do we?
No.
Julio!
Come here!
And you, get that foolish machine out of here.
All right, all right.
Next time maybe you'll stay in the cantina and do your chores like I tell you, huh?
Now, you wait here.
Come on, now.
Come on, you've got to drink this.
Bart, it's out there. I saw it. I swear!
A green monster with a head the size of this room.
What do I have to do to make you believe me?
Excuse me for intruding on this tender little scene.
Now we got a monster in here too.
You'd better start learning how to knock real quick, Hacker.
All the doors on this island are open to me, boss man.
I come here to complain about the noise you're making.
The citizenry doesn't like it.
And now I find your carelessness has almost cost us the lovely Miss Piper.
- It was my fault, Mr. Hacker.
- Nonsense.
You were supposed to put up warning signs before you started blasting.
They were up!
And this might not have happened
- if we'd had the extra men you promised.
- Men? What men?
The islanders, Hacker. Remember?
No, I don't remember.
Okay. For two weeks,
I've given you the benefit of the doubt while I've fallen behind schedule.
- From now on, we bypass you.
- That wouldn't be too wise.
The governor of the island gave us his cooperation and, as his representative, you're supposed to do the same.
Yours is cooperation, all right, but at a price, isn't it?
I look out for my people.
You bet you do.
Ban!
- Bart!
- What's wrong?
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't believe it.
- What?
- The monster?
- Two of them, Betty.
- Two what? What are you babbling about?
Two huge, ugly dinosaurs perfectly preserved at the bottom of the channel.
Are they dead?
Frozen solid.
- Million-year-old dinosaurs?
- The same, Bart.
I don't know what else they could be.
But I'll tell you one thing.
- One look and you'll never forget 'em.
- You see?
This ought to be worth a fortune.
We must've blasted through the rock that entombed them.
Some compressed gas caused the freezing,
I guess.
As island manager,
I demand you bring those things up!
Tread lightly. You don't demand anything around here today.
- Is the governor still in Washington?
- So far as I know, he is.
And that leaves me in complete charge of this island.
We'll send him a wire and have him contact the Smithsonian.
He'll send paleontologists down here right away, and we'll bring the critters up and put them on the beach.
- You think the big crane will handle 'em?
- I think so.
Get her set up, and I'll be with you in a minute.
Can I trust you to send this?
You have my word. And a witness.
All right, here.
- What are you grinning about?
- Was I grinning, boss man?
Maybe it's just that this time, after all your whining, you've caused your own delay.
We can't build a harbor around two dinosaurs, Hacker.
So we take a couple hours and move 'em, and we get right back to work with no more delays.
Bravo.
You were awfully hard on him, weren't you, Bart?
I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw a- a dinosaur.
Let's go monster fishing.
Okay, Lou, we're all hooked up.
Bring her in nice and easy.
Are they really dinosaurs, Senorita Betty?
- Yes, Julio, they are.
- Boy, this is terrific!
Keep her coming, Lou.
Well? What do you think, Bart?
Thank goodness he's not alive.
You can say that again.
- Let's get our hooks in the next one.
- Roger.
Is that what you saw?
You scared me.
With him around? Thanks a lot.
I just can't get over it.
- Is he alive, Senor Bart?
- No, he's not alive.
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.
Then why are his eyes open?
Well, he just-
He just slept with them open, that's all.
Boy, he's magnifico. That's for certain.
Wait till you see the next one.
They tell me he's even bigger.
He must weigh about 50 tons.
He doesn't look as mean as the other one.
He's not mean. He's herbivorous.
Where did you learn a word like that?
Oh, I'm well educated in those things.
I sent away a cereal box tops and got models just like them, only smaller.
Can I go up and see them closer?
- Okay, Professor.
- Oh, thanks, Senor Bart.
Senor Bart, he's very cold.
Yeah, he's what you might call kind of quick-frozen.
How long has he been that way?
Million years or so, I guess.
Boy, oh, boy!
I'd better investigate further!
Hey, look. Why don't you go change while I get things wrapped up here, and then we'll whisk away to a romantic spot for dinner.
The only restaurant on the island.
But you've got to admit it's the best cuisine in a thousand-mile radius.
- Okay, I'll be ready in a few minutes.
- Okay.
Hey, Bart.
You think we ought to leave a guard for our little playmates tonight?
Yeah, I guess so. I don't see how anyone's gonna walk off with them though.
Give him half a chance, and Hacker would try.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
- Senor Bart!
- What's the matter?
He's alive! Look!
Oh, no. No, no. He's just thawing out.
- Then will he be alive?
- Nope.
Hey, don't you think you'd better head on home?
No. Senor Hacker told me to wait in the car. I guess I'd better.
Okay.
O'Leary? Off and on, me bucko!
T.J. O'Leary at your service, boss.
O'Leary, I got a job for you tonight- babysitting.
With whose children?
Those dinosaurs over there.
Oh, saints preserve us.
Them are really there?
Oh, thank the good Lord.
I've been seeing them all afternoon and was afraid to tell anyone for fear it was the DTs!
Sure, if they be needin' diapering, you can find some tarpaulins behind the shed.
Oh, sure, boss! Sure!
And they ain't the first dinosaur
I've ever seen, you know.
Why, your timing's perfect.
Are you wrinkle-free and ready to go?
Yeah. If we hurry, we'll make it there before the rain does.
It sure gets dark fast down here.
Everything happens fast in the tropics.
Who is it?
It's me, Jasper.
Come in. It's about time you got here.
It was stormy and wet out tonight,
Mr. Hacker.
Fine, fine.
I don't need your weather report.
Sit down and shut up. I'll do the talking.
We're going to be rich, boys.
You hear that, Chica?
I heard, Hacker.
You don't sound too happy about it.
Should I be?
Why, sure.
You're my little tamale, aren't you?
- Leave me alone, Hacker.
- "Leave me alone, Hacker."
I don't hear you telling the turistas
“Leave me alone."
- Let me go. You are hurting me.
- I am going to be rich, Chica.
Dress you in pretty things, soft to the touch.
- I don't want your money.
- But I want you.
And I know certain things about you that certain authorities would like to find out.
- Lies!
- They'll lock you up in jail until your pretty face is old and wrinkled.
All you know is lies!
Maybe so.
But who will be believed, huh?
You or the island manager?
So you see, Chica... you are mine.
Why not enjoy it?
And now leave us alone, my little tamale.
We have some business to discuss.
I have found a caveman.
Perfectly intact.
Probably a million years old.
We are going to take him to the mainland and sell him for a fortune.
You mean he's dead?
Of course he's dead. He's prehistoric.
That's what makes him so valuable.
What's my cut?
Yeah, and mine?
A thousand dollars apiece for helping me get him to the boat as soon as the storm lets up.
- It's a deal.
- Yeah, right. It's a deal.
Telegram.
Help yourself to some food, boys.
Hey, how are you farin', my fine, strapping babes?
A- teethin', are ya? Well.
You're a very sweet and quiet babe not to be shriekin' about it.
And you too. Mustn't play favorites.
Well, I'm going in where it's warm, boys.
You be good now and sleep tight.
Hey, Julio. What you got there?
Oh, these are my monsters
I got from my cereal box tops.
I thought I'd bring them over to show you.
Say, those are really something.
Hey, Chuck, look.
This one's the brontosaurus.
He's a vegetarian.
He wouldn't hurt you unless you got in his way and he stepped on you.
But this one's the mean one, the tyrannosaurus.
He's got a bigger brain and a bigger appetite.
He eats meat, and he likes to eat brontosaurus, even better than people.
Well, I'll be darned. You really know a lot about these things, don't you?
Oh, yes, Senor Bart. I play with them all the time. They are my friends.
Julio!
What the devil are you doing out here?
You're going to learn when I tell you to stay in the back room and finish your chores quietly, that is exactly what I mean!
- Take it easy, Hacker!
- You keep your nose out of this.
I'm sorry, Sefior Hacker!
I won't do it again!
You're going to learn a lesson, boy.
Oh, no, senor, please! That's my friend!
Hacker, that's enough.
Now come here, boy.
I hate you! I'm gonna run away and never come back!
All right, go ahead! See if I care!
Julio, wait!
If anything happens to that boy,
I swear I'll take it out of your hide.
Julio?
- You couldn't find him.
- No, I couldn't.
Don't come another step closer, boss man, or I'll...
You'll what?
I'll slash you to ribbons.
Somebody bandage him up.
A little fortification and then we'll go out and see what that last bit 0' lightnin' has done to our babes.
Earthquakes too! Ha!
This place is ridiculous.
Did you ever see such a sight in your life? I-
I swear, I'll never take another drink as long as I live!
Good girl.
I wonder how long it'll be before the lights come on again.
The last time something happened to our generator, it was two days before they fixed it.
They didn't have any power on this whole island for two days?
Yes, except for some of the houses on the hills.
They have their own generator.
Storm's about over. Round up some of the boys. We'll go have a look.
Right.
No! No!
Go away!
No!
Let me go! Oh, no! Let me out!
Help! Help! Oh, let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!
Help! They've 9011-
Let me down! Oh, you wild beast!
Let me down! Help!
- What was that?
- It wasn't thunder, that's for sure.
- It sounded like dynamite. Come on. Chuck!
- Roger.
Let's go!
Hurry up!
They'll be too close to our prize package.
No dinosaurs, no shack.
And worst of all, no O'Leary.
Hey, boss!
O'Leary's hat.
You think he's dead?
Nobody could live through that kind of an explosion, Dumpy.
Poor guy.
What happened to the dinosaurs?
Bart! Come here!
It looks like the big one just up and walked away.
Walked away?
How could he walk away if he's dead?
- It isn't possible.
- What are we going to do?
Uh-oh.
Look.
What are you doing, Hacker?
I was looking to see- to see if Julio was around here.
Under the leaves?
You can do better than that.
A fat lot you care what happens to that boy.
Will you get your hands off me?
I've had a change of heart.
Okay, I was wrong this time.
You had nothing to do with this.
You don't know what that sound was, do you?
A bird?
That's a dinosaur, Hacker.
A big, hungry, flesh-eating dinosaur.
You mean...
We gotta get back to town and start making phone calls for help.
- The phones are out, Bart.
- The overseas phone.
- Everything's out.
- How do we get word out, Hacker?
Mail boat will be in tomorrow morning.
By tomorrow, we could all be dead.
Doesn't anyone here have a shortwave radio?
Some of the fishing boats have some, but they won't be back till the end of the week.
When can we get an answer to that wire?
I... I didn't get around to sending it.
Well, that's just great.
Bart, I wish my dad wasn't away.
He's got some sort of radio rig.
- A shortwave radio?
- Yes, he's a ham operator.
But he's always taking it apart.
I don't know if it's working.
At least it's something to go on.
I think I can get it to work.
Meantime, we've got to figure out some way of defending ourselves.
How many weapons are there on the island?
Some small-game guns, a couple of pistols.
But what good would they be against those monsters?
And there's a relic cannon up at the old fortress.
- That might not be a bad idea, Bart.
- A relic cannon?
No, the fortress.
I was up there last Sunday.
It's just some old ruins, but the walls are thick and fairly high.
And there's what's left of a moat around the place.
We could widen it and burn oil as a barrier.
That sounds like our best idea.
Get the bulldozers and whatever else you need to get set up at the fortress.
- Right.
- Tell everybody on the way up there.
Hey, boss, maybe if I rang the fire gong, we could get them all out in a hurry.
No, no. All we need is a couple hundred frightened people running through town.
That monster will know where his next meal's coming from.
How about us with the heavy equipment?
I don't think he'll bother you if you travel in a tight convoy.
- Drive with your lights out.
- Roger.
Let's go, guys. Come on.
We've got work to do.
You girls go on with Chuck.
Dumpy and I will spread the word in town, and we'll get to your house and see if that radio's working.
- Bart, my mother's home all alone.
- Don't worry. We'll bring her back.
How about you, Hacker?
Are we gonna get any help from you?
I've got to go find my boy.
I feel terrible. He means so much to me.
I will risk the danger. I'll take my men, and we'll go search the island.
I understand. We'll keep a lookout too.
You see, Bart? Nobody's all bad.
Senor Bart, when I was a little girl in another country, there was a revolution.
My father taught me how to make bombs out of bottles and gasoline.
- We'll use some, no?
- We'll use some, yes.
- Run and tell Chuck that.
- Okay.
Hey, boss. There's a couple of walkie-talkies in the tool shed.
Should I get 'em?
We'll keep in touch with Chuck.
- That's a good idea, Dumpy.
- Okay.
Bart, I'm going with you.
No, you're not.
It's a lot safer for you at the fortress.
We may never get there.
If something happens,
I want to be with you.
Is that you, Betty?
How was the boy dressed, Mr. Hacker?
I didn't notice.
Don't be so style-conscious, Jasper.
We're looking for the caveman, not that brat.
I knew you hadn't changed.
Remember, you're the friendly vegetarian, like it says on the cereal box.
Hey, you are friendly.
We are going to be friends, you and me.
That's the bad tyrannosaurus!
You'd better run and find a swamp to hide in, where he won't follow you.
'Cause if he catches us, he'll eat both of us up.
And he'll like you better than me
'cause you're bigger.
And I don't want him to eat you, so please run!
I know you don't know which way to run, and I wish I could tell you.
But you see, I'm just a boy and I'm lost
'cause I don't go out at night by myself, and I don't know where the swamps are.
You see? You've got to go!
Please run! I can't push you!
That a boy!
Run, run! And keep running!
Good-bye, my friend.
I hope I will see you again soon.
Take care of yourself.
Tom, tell everyone to go quickly and quietly.
Once they get to the fortress, they should just relax.
- Dumpy, let's go!
- Okay, boss!
Hey, boss, it's a dud, ain't it?
No, you have to light that cloth tail,
Dumpy.
But a spark could do it.
- Put them in here.
- Yeah, boss.
Put them on something soft so they don't get jostled.
- And no smoking.
- You ain't kiddin'.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
Do you read me? Over.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
XLN2W calling LNR6J.
Come in, please.
XLNZW calling-
I wish we could go faster.
These roads don't help any.
We are almost there, Chuck.
Mousey!
- Did you find him?
- Nope.
The whole back part is filled with water,
Mr. Hacker.
That's why they closed this place.
They haven't used it in years.
Let's get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.
Jasper seems to be enjoying it.
Huh, Jasper?
Sure, boss. It's very interesting.
I mean, where else are you going to find a caveman except in a cave?
“In a cave." “In a cave.“
Jasper, your intelligence never ceases to amaze me.
I didn't know you were an anthropologist.
Not a very good one, boss.
I mean, I ain't been to church in years.
Ah, well, if he's not in a cave, maybe he's in a house.
Come on. We'll start looking in houses.
Is there anyone else living out this way we could warn?
No. Ours is the next place, and it's the last one.
Betty?
Senorita Betty?
Holy smoke! A real caveman!
You want this?
Boy, you sure are hungry.
I guess maybe you are a houseguest of
Betty's scientist father, the doctor, huh?
More? Funny they didn't show you where the food was.
Come on, I'll show you. See?
We're in luck! We've got some pie. See?
You take those things over to the table while I make us something warm to drink.
I don't think Betty would mind.
You really don't know much about these things, do you?
I'll be your friend. I'll show you.
Come on, caveman, come on.
Come on.
Right here.
No. Eat with your fork.
Like this.
Eat right. Eat like this.
With your fork.
That must be Betty. Come on. Surprise her.
Show her how I taught you how to eat with a fork.
Surprise!
There he is. Get the kid out of the way, and get him with as few blows as is possible.
Run, caveman! Run! They're bad men!
No! No, caveman! It's not right to kill!
You two are worthless. Stand back.
Let a man at him. You got the rope?
Yeah, boss. Right here.
All right. I'll pin him down, you bind his hands and feet.
What are you standing there for?
Get out and get him, or I pity both of you!
Go on!
Come on. They can't be far ahead.
Come on. If we have to run all night, we're going to catch them.
Come on. Top speed.
Mother?
There's nobody here, that's for sure.
Boy, this place is a mess.
Mother!
Yeah, and whoever busted this up sure did a thorough job.
Boy, they sure did.
Mother!
- Better calm her down.
- You think...
I don't know.
She's not here, Bart.
Something's happened. I know it.
Come on, calm down. Keep your chin up.
Look, her car's gone.
She could be in town, or she might be at the fortress already with Chuck.
- Do you think she might be?
- There's a good chance.
Besides, going to pieces isn't going to help a bit.
Somebody had a sloppy feast in here, Bart.
And the teakettle's still boiling.
Whoever was here didn't leave long ago.
Dumpy, go out to the jeep and see if you can contact Chuck on the walkie-talkie.
He should be at the fortress by now.
Gotcha, boss.
- What do we do now?
- We'll head for the fortress.
See if you've got kerosene lanterns.
We could use them.
Okay, I'll get them.
Hey, boss!
Yeah?
Yeah, Chuck, sure. Just a minute.
Here he comes now.
Betty's mother is safe.
Oh, good. Tell Betty and give her a hand, will you, Dumpy?
- I sure will.
- Yeah, Chuck?
Yeah, Bart. So far, so good.
Not a sign of the monsters. And we're making pretty good progress with the moat.
If we could be sure of a couple more hours, I'd say we'd have it secured.
- How about the islanders?
- We got most of them in from the village.
There are more coming from the hills all the time.
They're frightened.
I can't say that I blame them.
When I stop to think of it,
I get pretty scared myself.
I know what you mean.
- How about Julio?
- Not a sign of him.
We'll keep our eyes peeled for him on the way back.
I'd comb the jungle if I thought there was a chance of finding him alive.
Don't be a fool, Bart. You'll have a hard enough time just getting back here.
I know.
- She said she saw an ape man?
- That's what she said, Betty.
She probably was so frightened she really didn't know what she saw.
At least she's all right. You want to take these out and put them in the jeep?
I'll get a first-aid kit in case we need it.
And don't be too long, because the sooner we get back to those fortress walls, the better I'll feel.
Okay.
Hey, boss?
Boss? Boss, where are you?
Over here, Dumpy.
Look what I found. Hacker's car.
Uh-oh. I wonder what he's got to do with that mess inside?
And the broken radio.
Check under the seats.
I don't know what to look for, but I wouldn't put anything past that man.
Bart, it's Julio!
Dumpy, we've got to get that boy!
Hurry, Bart, hurry! Julio, we're coming!
We may need those. Come on!
Boy, you sure are one terrific caveman, you know that?
I never had so much fun in my life!
I didn't know you could ride a dinosaur.
Julio! Julio!
- What are we gonna do?
- Julio, it's me, Betty!
Senorita Betty, run! Go away!
Look out behind you!
He saved her life, but there's no telling what he might do next. Come on!
This way.
I'm lost, boss. Any idea where we are?
The house is back that way.
We just got to keep going. Through here.
Whoa! Please stop!
We'll be right back where we started, and the tyrannosaurus will eat us up!
You saved my life.
I really don't know how to thank you.
I'm very grateful.
You want me to cook it? Your dinner.
I think you ought to know something before I start.
I'm not a very good cook.
You don't care, huh?
Okay. One rabbit, medium-rare.
Hope that's how you like it.
I hope you don't have anything else on your mind.
Wristwatch.
Now, now. Nice caveman. Just sit there, and I'll go fix things in the kitchen.
Now, let's see.
What does a nice caveman do after a hard day's work in the jungle?
No, no, don't tell me. Let me think of something tame on my own.
Like sitting down.
And we'll keep all other thoughts out of our romantic little Neanderthal minds.
Okay?
Let's see.
Maybe if I sing you a song, you'll fall asleep, and then I can run away from you, hmm?
Lullaby and good night
Go to sleep, little caveman
Leave my friend alone, you bad old tyrannosaurus!
Talk about ringside seats.
Hit him again with your tail!
Come on! Hit him!
Oh, no! Boss, look over there.
Boss, I don't see the kid anymore.
He's on the other side. The way they're spinning around, he could get crushed.
Come on, we got to get him.
Not that way. That's quicksand!
No! No!
Julio!
The caveman again.
Follow him, we'll get to Betty too.
- There he is, men.
- Yeah.
Yeah, but look at that monster.
We're going in to get that caveman.
I don't want the money, boss.
- It's too late for that now, Jasper.
- I'm sorry, boss. I quit.
Jasper, come back here!
We've got to get him away from that cave.
Now!
Come on, Mr. Hacker, have a heart.
I'm telling you, Mousey, it'll be perfectly safe.
Get in through that opening, climb down on the rope, take him prisoner, and bring him out when the coast is clear.
I'm scared of the monster and the bomb too, Mr. Hacker.
One. I'm tired of being disobeyed, Mousey.
I'm ashamed of myself. I really am.
Two. I mean business this time.
You know I'd do anything for you.
You know that, Mr. Hacker.
But this... this will be suicide.
- Three.
- Okay, okay. I'll go.
Mousey, you yellow coward! I'll kill you!
I'll do it myself.
That mine shaft's nothing but a bunch of rotted timbers.
It can't hold much longer the way he's going at it.
And these things don't bother him a bit.
Maybe if I could pop one right in his mouth, he'd decide to beat it out of here.
Boss, that's a good trick if you can do it.
When I tell you, you throw one of those bombs as close to his eyes as you can.
That'll attract his attention.
It'll let me get within a couple of feet, where I can't miss.
Okay.
Mr. Hacker, thank goodness you're here.
Don't anybody move.
Blasted rope. Now we have to wait for the monster to leave before we can get out.
Unless we give him some distraction while the others leave.
- You must be crazy!
- Is that what you think?
Do you know how much money people all over the world will pay to look at that monkey man?
Oh, what is this? Bravery, huh?
Little man, I could puncture holes in you with this play toy of mine.
He doesn't know what a gun is.
He's just a nice, kind-
Leave him alone!
Don't worry, boy. I won't hurt him.
He's going to be my fortune.
And you- you are going to be my way out of here.
No, Hacker, no!
I'm getting out of here!
We got rid of him for a while.
- Yeah. Boy, is he mad!
- Let's get in there.
Betty, Julio, are you all right?
- Oh, Bart.
- Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go!
Caveman! Caveman!
Go on, go on!
- Get him out of here.
- Caveman! Caveman!
- Come on, caveman!
- Come on!
Come on!
Couple more minutes, and that dinosaur is gonna remember he's hungry again.
Did Hacker get out?
Yeah.
Caveman! Where is the caveman!
Come on!
Look!
Look, he's heading for the quicksand!
Now's our chance. Head back to the jeep.
I'm gonna take another look around here just in case.
Be careful.
I will. Now hurry.
Caveman! Caveman! Caveman!
We got a ditch all around the fortress except on the side overlooking the ocean.
We just open those drums, put a torch to the oil, and we got a moat of flames.
Good. Is everyone in the fortress?
Yeah, everybody except for the guys in the equipment.
And there's a little path over there they can go up in case they get caught outside when the fire starts.
You've done a good job, Chuck.
We got enough oil?
That's the problem. The moat had to be bigger than I anticipated.
How many minutes of flame can you give me?
Five, maybe, if we're lucky.
- No sign of the boat yet?
- No.
Pedro?
Quieres comer?
I'm not hungry.
You should eat something, Julio.
A growing boy needs-
I don't want to grow anymore.
The mail boat will soon be here.
You're probably going to get that airplane from the cereal box.
I don't care about any airplane.
Well, remember, there's a good bowl of soup if you want it.
What are you seeing out there, Dumpy?
Nothing. And right now, that looks mighty good to me.
Are you taking care of the alarm?
Hey!
Huh? Monster!
Take it easy. Relax.
The monster's not here yet.
But you keep your eyes open, and you'll be a fine alarm man.
Sí', senor. Sorry.
Sorry, senor.
I hope the rest of our setup is better than that.
Don't worry about him.
If that monster comes within a mile of this place, that bell will be ringing.
He's here! Sound the alarm!
Dinosaurus!
Monster!
We got to hold it off as long as possible.
- It's holding him.
- Yeah, but for how long?
- You're in charge. I got an idea.
- Hey, wait a minute!
Bart! Bart!
- Bart, let me come with you.
- I can't.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna knock that monster off the cliff.
I love you.
I can't hear you.
Be careful. I love you.
Chica.
Hey, Chuck, do you think we can drive the bulldozer through the fire?
Not a chance, Dumpy. Why?
To help Bart. Look what he's doing.
Come on, Senor Bart! Get him!
Watch out, Senor Bart!
Dumpy, if you've ever prayed, do it now.
- Oh, Senor Bart.
- Bart, are you all right?
- Bart, that was terrific.
- Oh, thank heavens.
- Wasn't he great?
- Senor Bart, why did the caveman have to die?
Well, Julio... there's a time for everything.
The caveman slept all those years, and then one day he awoke like Rip Van Winkle... and found the world so changed that he didn't belong in it anymore.
How would you like it if you woke in the 21st century?
No, house, no friends, even the town gone.
Just a strange world.
I would like it.
You know, I bet you would at that.
I'll bet one day you will wake in the 21st century.
You really mean it?
Yeah.
Oh, boy!
There you are, my dear.
There's your tropical island.
Look at all those people up there waving at us.
Do you suppose they greet all the ships like this?
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
On a peaceful, quiet island like this,
I don't suppose they have anything better to do.
{361}{548}LATITUDE ZERO
{2499}{2565}Longitude, one hundred eighty degrees.

{2826}{2929}The largest oceanographic ship in the world,|the Japanese research vessel "Fuji"...
{2931}{3007}...has sailed eastward|from the Gilbert Islands to...
{3010}{3119}...an area in the equatorial South Pacific|to investigate and analyze what is known...
{3125}{3217}...as the Cromwell Current,|a subsurface stream flowing east from...
{3219}{3280}...New Guinea to the coast of Ecuador.
{3397}{3442}Why do they study it?
{3446}{3577}Because possibly it can be used|by submarines to increase speed...
{3579}{3666}...just as the jet stream is|used by high-flying aircraft.
{4387}{4414}Shall we go?
{4421}{4438}Yeah.
{4465}{4601}Dr. Ken Tashiro, physicist and|oceanographer is in command.
{4630}{4691}Aiding him is Dr. Jules Masson.

{5127}{5140}Oh!
{5159}{5174}Hey.
{5247}{5338}I wasn't going to light up in here.|l just carry it to ease my mind.
{5454}{5513}This is control. How do you read us?
{5535}{5617}Loud and clear.|Just passing twenty fathoms.
{5619}{5661}How's the temperature?
{5701}{5774}Exterior watertemp|two-zero degrees centigrade.

{6522}{6546}Check this!
{6595}{6619}The fish...
{6702}{6753}How come they're all going one way?
{6870}{6909}What'd you make of it?
{6963}{7023}Do they know something that we don't?
{7027}{7068}Turn on the searchlights.
{7527}{7588}Exterior water temp is one-five...
{7618}{7676}That's normal for this depth.
{8389}{8443}Hey! What's that coming at us?
{14055}{14088}Where are we?
{14101}{14160}-Looks like we were saved.|-Right.
{14214}{14287}Hey, we don't have any scars either.
{14293}{14351}Look, they are all healed.
{14575}{14656}Glad to see you two are feeling better.|l'm Dr. Anne Barton.
{14662}{14696}Dr. Tashiro...

{14797}{14867}Jules...Dr. Jules Masson.
{14902}{14921}He's okay?
{14928}{15000}We're taking care of him.|He's in a separate cabin.
{15016}{15108}When you feel up to getting dressed,|the Control Room's straight ahead.
{15142}{15227}Oh, I don't know whose camera it is,|but I put it there.
{15350}{15393}Doctor of medicine?
{15544}{15575}How do you feel?
{16764}{16812}Oh, nice to see you up and about.
{16814}{16861}You must be Dr. Tashiro...
{16863}{16875}Yes.
{16879}{16938}l'm Captain Craig McKenzie.|Nice to meet you.
{16941}{16991}This is my assistant, Kobo.
{17042}{17066}Mr. Lawton...
{17069}{17092}Trans Globe...
{17095}{17152}Ah yes, all the news from pole to pole.
{17155}{17187}We do try.
{17198}{17235}How is Dr. Masson, sir?
{17237}{17335}Dr. Barton reported he is suffering|from shock and a cranial injury.
{17337}{17363}Is it bad?
{17366}{17432}Everything is being done to effect|his recovery as soon as possible.
{17434}{17522}This Dr. Barton looks so young!|She doesn't look much like a doctor.
{17527}{17616}Mr. Lawton, what's a doctor|supposed to look like?
{17620}{17645}Well...
{17655}{17702}Now, there...what is that?
{17768}{17840}That is the volcano that tore|you loose from your mooring.
{17869}{17939}Now you're seeing it from a viewing|scanner we have on the surface.
{17941}{17973}How close is it?
{18004}{18047}About ten miles away.
{18057}{18131}Our volcanologists have been|predicting this eruption for a month.
{18133}{18185}That's why we are here to observe it.
{18188}{18252}And that's why we happened|to observe your difficulty.
{18279}{18376}Had you been dropped two miles farther|south, you'd have been incinerated.
{18397}{18442}That's a pleasant thought.
{18453}{18482}Where are we?
{18486}{18522}What is this anyway?
{18525}{18576}This is the Alpha, a submersible.
{18583}{18632}An American nuclear sub?
{18683}{18714}Or Japanese?
{18721}{18784}No. Mr. Lawton, neither are we|American, Russian, British...
{18787}{18830}...nor any other nationality.
{18833}{18868}We are neutral.
{18918}{18953}You're neutral?
{18959}{19053}Look, a submarine like this has got to|come from somewhere. Now where?
{19081}{19127}-That's irrelevant.|-It can't be.
{19129}{19187}I'm a reporter. I do know|a story when I see one.
{19189}{19279}I imagine you do, but you can't|cable your editors from here.
{19341}{19360}Perry!
{19517}{19628}The Alpha, launched June 21 , 1805...
{19634}{19741}Stornaway Harbor, Hebrides...|that's in Scotland, isn't it?
{19863}{19971}That would make this submarine|a hundred sixty-four years old!
{19973}{20005}Can you believe that?
{20006}{20026}No way.
{20041}{20080}Neither do I.
{20197}{20255}Excuse me, Captain McKenzie.
{20257}{20279}Yes?
{20284}{20378}This business about your submarine|being launched in 1805...
{20398}{20441}That's a put-on, isn't it?
{20445}{20461}What?
{20474}{20507}I mean...a joke.
{20509}{20527}No.
{20629}{20694}Captain, he's not responding.
{20698}{20778}I am afraid, we can't treat him|successfully aboard the Alpha.
{20780}{20859}You know the importance of|this observation, don't you?
{20872}{20939}-How urgent is this problem?|-Very urgent.
{20941}{20986}The shock factor is manageable, but...
{20989}{21077}...he suffered some internal injuries|requiring care we're not equipped to give.
{21082}{21141}Then you recommend|we call off this mission?
{21143}{21184}If he's to live.
{21249}{21323}What are you gonna do now, Captain?|Toss a coin?
{21489}{21562}-Kobo, set course to El-zee.|-Yes, Captain.
{21743}{21826}Hello, El-zee, this is the Alpha.
{21829}{21878}Go ahead, Captain McKenzie.
{21881}{21928}We are aborting the mission.
{21954}{22040}Alert Rehabilitation Clinic to pick up|injured man as soon as we dock.
{22065}{22093}That is all.
{22116}{22137}Kobo...
{22170}{22202}Flank speed.
{22205}{22233}Yes, Captain.
{22405}{22444}How fast are we going?
{22446}{22498}A shade under eighty knots.
{22503}{22556}Now if you'll excuse me...
{22678}{22726}Dock at Latitude Zero?
{22729}{22820}That's where the Equator and|lnternational Date Line cross.
{22823}{22882}But there's no land there.
{23093}{23109}Malic!
{23130}{23148}Malic!
{23163}{23189}Come quickly!
{23219}{23277}Have our agents finally|kidnapped Dr. Okada?
{23282}{23338}No word from them, but look!
{23350}{23405}McKenzie is leaving the volcano.
{24096}{24153}Kroiga, this is Malic.
{24180}{24245}I am here, my lord Malic.
{24252}{24334}The Alpha is northeast of you,|on course for Latitude Zero.
{24354}{24438}It would please me if you|intercepted and destroyed it.
{24450}{24512}Your wish is my command, my lord.
{24577}{24647}We're near enough to|get McKenzie this time.
{24690}{24757}You should reach the Alpha|within the quarter hour.
{24774}{24821}Do your best, little one.
{24828}{24880}McKenzie will be destroyed.
{24882}{24929}This I promise, my lord.
{24931}{25002}And your reward shall|be waiting, little one.
{25169}{25217}Your jealousy is showing.
{25238}{25294}I can't help it. I just hate that woman.
{25297}{25354}Don't be silly. She's useful to us.
{25414}{25465}You're the only woman I keep with me.
{25468}{25548}Please get rid of her and let|Ching take over the Black Shark.
{25550}{25662}I will, eventually...|after she destroys the Alpha and McKenzie.
{25722}{25821}Later, Lucretia, when we have|something to really celebrate.
{26518}{26554}The Black Shark.
{26566}{26601}Is it going to attack?
{26602}{26647}It always has. Turn off the lights.
{26649}{26662}Yes.
{26719}{26766}Do you have anything to fight it with?
{26769}{26826}We have nothing as|powerful as what it has.
{26842}{26891}It's faster than us as well.
{26912}{26973}It's a matter of how to escape.
{27821}{27866}Go up twenty meters.
{28196}{28246}Maybe that avalanche caught them.
{28844}{28904}Prepare search missiles!
{29338}{29390}Search missiles ready!
{29771}{29814}Those aren't torpedoes!
{29816}{29871}No, they are search missiles.
{29883}{29925}They follow our heat path.
{29928}{29999}Kobo, activate the icing equipment.
{30007}{30026}Yes, Captain.
{30282}{30315}It doesn't work, Captain.
{30799}{30842}Do something! Will you!
{31364}{31426}McKenzie has increased|the mobility of the Alpha.
{31427}{31497}He's forever changing|something on that damned boat!
{31499}{31572}Your ''little one'' is no match for him.
{31575}{31650}Don't underestimate her|just because you dislike her.
{31652}{31691}She was stupid!
{31693}{31778}If those missiles had backfired,|she could have cost us the Black Shark.
{32020}{32112}Trying to get close up to use|their laser cannon, I would guess.
{32643}{32668}Another sub!
{32670}{32731}No. That's a ghost image of us.
{32934}{32963}Marvelous!
{32975}{33011}How ingenious!
{33100}{33156}It must be a projection|device of some kind.
{33159}{33239}Of course! But which is the real Alpha|and which is the image?
{33267}{33364}How bloody inventive that McKenzie is!
{33799}{33838}I have done it!
{33846}{33890}I have finally done it!
{33941}{33976}Did she do it?
{34003}{34076}That's what McKenzie|would like us to believe.
{34123}{34138}See?
{34195}{34241}He has made a fool of her.
{34256}{34322}She shouldn't have fired|those missiles so soon!
{34528}{34567}How did you do that?
{34568}{34662}Well, not exactly with mirrors,|Dr. Tashiro.
{34774}{34802}Top speed!
{34820}{34842}Ram it!
{35668}{35704}What's that glow?
{35707}{35775}That's the light of our artificial sun.
{35795}{35839}Sun? Under the sea?
{35855}{35919}Kobo, turn on the equalizers.
{35934}{35956}Yes, Captain.
{36376}{36406}Faster! Faster!
{37315}{37372}l'm sure Kroiga did her best.
{37375}{37421}She shouldn't have failed...
{37686}{37744}Order the Black Shark|back to Blood Rock.
{37750}{37855}Then contact our agents in Japan and|find out about kidnapping Dr. Okada.
{38230}{38286}l better get back to my patient.
{38426}{38482}What happened to the Black Shark?
{38500}{38580}The electronic shield of light|prevents entry into Latitude Zero...
{38582}{38669}...to all vehicles except the Alpha|and a few others that have...
{38672}{38722}...equalizing equipment.
{38734}{38808}It's a sort of regular electric|fence around your ranch, right?
{38811}{38851}In a sense, yes.
{38861}{38916}-Kobo, take over, please.|-Yes, Captain.
{38981}{39034}Who does the Black Shark belong to?
{39036}{39161}To an evil genius named Malic,|and his companion Lucretia.
{39188}{39259}The captain of the Black Shark|is a woman named Kroiga.
{39348}{39435}Formidable opponent.|More skillful than most seamen.
{39504}{39554}Where's this Black Shark from?
{39556}{39663}Malic's base at Blood Rock. It's an|island some distance north of here.
{39675}{39729}And you're always at war|with each other?
{39731}{39859}He lives up to his name. In one archaic|language ''Malic'' means murderer.
{39880}{39979}lf it wasn't for the efforts of Latitude Zero,|he might have taken over your world...
{39983}{40016}...a century ago.
{40030}{40067}A century ago?
{40071}{40131}Yes, we were students.
{40137}{40229}We were friends then,|but he chose one path...I another.
{40231}{40275}Wait, just a minute.
{40286}{40406}Are you saying that you and he were|students together over a century ago?
{40411}{40425}Yes.
{40429}{40482}What? Just how old are you?
{40487}{40607}Well, since you question everything,|I don't expect you to believe this...
{40609}{40669}...or much of anything else|you're about to see.
{40676}{40739}l am two hundred and four years old.
{40741}{40805}Malic is now two hundred and three.
{40873}{40923}How about Dr. Barton...
{40955}{41001}How old does that make her?
{41007}{41039}Mr. Lawton.
{41049}{41149}Even in Latitude Zero, gentlemen|do not discuss the age of a lady.
{41187}{41249}We'll be docking soon.
{43840}{43917}Are we actually at|the bottom of the sea?
{43920}{43988}Yes, a little more than|eleven thousand fathoms.
{43991}{44047}ls taking pictures here forbidden?
{44049}{44068}Not at all.
{44069}{44157}Oh good, because nobody's gonna|believe me unless l show them pictures.
{44159}{44225}They might not even believe me anyway.
{44345}{44373}Gently, Kobo.
{44375}{44387}Yes.
{44494}{44546}-Is he all right?|-He will be better soon.
{44553}{44617}I'll go with him to the|Rehabilitation Clinic.
{45106}{45144}Is that electrically operated?
{45146}{45217}Yes. We have no internal|combustion machines here.
{45219}{45256}So no smog.
{45285}{45375}Kobo, report the malfunction of|the icing equipment and have...
{45377}{45496}...the R and D people make the modifications|on the bow rudders l requested.
{45505}{45528}Yes, Captain.
{45529}{45602}Now, I'll take you to the Great Hall.
{46205}{46263}This is a model of Latitude Zero.
{46269}{46324}Here's the Great Hall where we are now.
{46326}{46353}Fabulous.
{46356}{46387}Who does it all belong to?
{46390}{46427}To the people who live here.
{46430}{46505}But who runs it?|Nothing can operate all by itself!
{46506}{46612}Mr. Lawton, are you skeptical by|nature or because of your profession?
{46614}{46650}I'm a realist.
{46674}{46717}We are the realists.
{46719}{46775}That's why we're not political here.
{46790}{46898}Politics are only needed by people|incapable of running their own lives.
{46943}{46968}I'm sorry.
{46971}{47006}Quite all right.
{47018}{47043}Here you go.
{47118}{47137}Hey.
{47170}{47230}Welcome home, Craig!|How was the volcano?
{47233}{47253}Erupting!
{47290}{47356}Professor Bella, a nuclear physicist.
{47361}{47429}He's made many contributions|to our sunshine.
{47431}{47482}Now we can get much more Vitamin D.
{47506}{47585}Comes up six o'clock in the morning|and dims down at eight at night.
{47613}{47663}Please, change my name to Alice.
{47666}{47760}l didn't take a ride in a bathysphere.|l just fell through the looking glass.
{47763}{47860}Mr. Lawton, you can be very good|company when you aren't glowering.
{47862}{47893}Thank you.
{47912}{47943}Dr. Karnack!
{47956}{48002}Don't you look fine today.
{48084}{48117}Dr. Karnack?
{48120}{48170}Karnack? The Russian mathematician?
{48172}{48184}Yes.
{48196}{48285}He was reported killed in an|air crash five or six years ago!
{48329}{48445}Dr. Tashiro seemed to understand|what I tried to explain about Latitude Zero.
{48450}{48526}But Perry Lawton found it|difficuIt to accept.
{48548}{48633}But he appreciated that the|variety of architectural styles...
{48635}{48717}...in our residential area represented|international tastes...
{48719}{48828}...and reflected the desire to preserve|what was good from the past.
{48849}{48918}Are you trying to tell us|that nobody down here ever...
{48930}{48981}...raises his voice or has an argument?
{48984}{49101}Of course we all do, but arguments are|to solve problems, not bolster egos.
{49174}{49220}Do you understand that, Doctor?
{49222}{49267}-Yes, l do.|-All right.
{49290}{49364}Does everybody down here|wear gold clothing?
{49390}{49429}We use a good deal of it.
{49430}{49481}You mean there are gold mines here?
{49486}{49539}Oh, no. We extract it from sea water.
{49543}{49600}It's inexpensive and very practical.
{49610}{49702}It's getting dark. I'll take you|to the bachelor apartments.
{49710}{49783}You can eat your dinner there|and have a nice rest.
{49785}{49878}Captain McKenzie, where exactly|is Jules Masson now?
{49891}{49979}He is right here.|He's in this Rehabilitation Clinic.
{50298}{50348}Everything is near normal.
{50353}{50441}You see, the cranial bruise|has already healed.
{50459}{50512}The lung puncture has closed.
{50550}{50624}The broken ribs have knitted quickly.
{50637}{50732}The new narrow injections promote|healing in a miraculously short time.
{50753}{50810}Really nothing to be concerned about.
{50813}{50895}All he now requires is ample sleep.
{50907}{50964}When can he be released, Dr. Sugata?
{50970}{51002}In the morning.
{51064}{51110}Goodnight, Dr. Barton.
{51120}{51163}'Night, Dr. Sugata.
{51846}{51875}Come in.
{51974}{51999}Excuse me.
{52041}{52071}Here's the bathroom.
{52073}{52135}Tomorrow morning this closet|will be full of fresh clothing.
{52138}{52191}The YMCA was never like this.
{52205}{52237}Here's the bed.
{52367}{52420}Captain McKenzie!|Is this what l think it is?
{52423}{52448}A diamond.
{52454}{52480}ls it real?
{52483}{52542}Everything in Latitude Zero is real.
{52589}{52659}Do you mind if I take a few|of those stones, Captain?
{52705}{52736}Take all you like.
{52738}{52806}We only use them for|abrasive or cutting tools.
{52843}{52902}That's their only real value to us.
{53171}{53202}Why are you sweating?
{53203}{53281}Because I never was an|instant millionaire before!
{53286}{53333}Thank you very much, Captain McKenzie!
{53352}{53386}Don't mention it.
{53452}{53479}All right.
{53524}{53593}Goodnight, gentlemen.|l'll see you in my office tomorrow.
{53987}{54051}You can't have everything.
{54054}{54071}Hmmm?
{54076}{54134}No moon, no stars in the sky.
{54165}{54298}Those people McKenzie talked to,|or about, they had disappeared...
{54316}{54408}...or they were reported missing|and finally presumed to be dead.
{54439}{54522}Maybe we're in Paradise|and don't even know it.
{54539}{54596}Oh, come on now! I'm serious!
{54651}{54718}You know what, McKenzie|and some of his cronies...
{54720}{54813}...could've kidnapped those people|and brought them down here.
{54819}{54934}And they brainwashed them|into working for him as slaves.
{54939}{54983}You're out of your head.
{54994}{55099}And now he's trying to brainwash us!|You act like he's already gotten to you!
{55104}{55142}He sure has.
{55177}{55238}Or maybe while we were|still out, we were given...
{55240}{55330}...some sort of injections that|might have caused hallucinations!
{55363}{55410}Oh, come on! Perry.
{55415}{55452}No, I mean it.
{55459}{55558}When we come to, we might find we're|just another exhibit in Marineland.
{55722}{55785}What's McKenzie up to now?
{55787}{55842}He's doing something to the Alpha.
{55844}{55930}Every change he makes in it also|makes him more difficult to destroy.
{55993}{56052}lf only there was some way|to puncture that dome...
{56054}{56111}You know there's no way of doing that!
{56113}{56199}We must get him away from there|if we're ever going to get him.
{56339}{56421}This is Malic...|From Tokyo? Go ahead.
{56465}{56506}Dr. Okada has escaped?
{56507}{56534}Escaped?
{56544}{56638}l'm not interested in why or how|you failed to kidnap him in Tokyo.
{56675}{56712}When did he sail?
{56723}{56758}What's the route?
{56781}{56858}Report to our agent in Osaka|and wait for further orders.
{56908}{56987}Dr. Okada and his daughter|sailed from Yokohama last night.
{56990}{57057}The ship is bound for Honolulu,|then San Francisco.
{57062}{57112}Are Latitude Zero agents with him?
{57115}{57142}I don't know.
{57161}{57213}But, we've got to get Okada here.
{57215}{57264}Killing two birds with one stone...
{57267}{57381}I'll get the secret of his immunized|radiation formula and also use him as bait!
{57421}{57451}Don't you see?
{57453}{57544}I'll make sure McKenzie finds out|Okada is here on Blood Rock...
{57552}{57644}...then when he comes to rescue him,|it'll be the end of McKenzie!
{57653}{57733}Yes. So we will lure him to come to us.
{57735}{57791}That's the idea, Lucretia.
{57807}{57868}Now contact Kroiga for me.
{57878}{57996}She has one more mission to perform|before I ''retire'' her from service.
{58104}{58174}I'm very grateful to you for|saving my life, Captain McKenzie.
{58175}{58258}Not at all, Dr. Masson.|She talked me into it...
{58298}{58342}-Good morning.|-Good morning, Captain McKenzie.
{58347}{58395}-Ken!|-Jules! You look fine!
{58398}{58455}Why shouldn't l?|Look who's been taking care of me.
{58457}{58508}Well, they sure got you|up and around fast!
{58511}{58598}Medical science here is so advanced.|They were just minor injuries for them.
{58681}{58718}What's this thing?
{58727}{58788}This is a model of|our special vehicles...
{58845}{58927}...which will be used for transporting|our Project Teams to and from...
{58929}{58962}...Latitude Zero.
{58964}{58990}From where?
{58991}{59029}From all over the world.
{59032}{59107}For instance, this is|the Project Team Three.
{59267}{59317}The chemist is Sir Morris Polley.
{59327}{59374}But, he defected to the Communists!
{59376}{59423}So the Western Press reported.
{59425}{59477}The Communists said nothing...
{59479}{59554}...preferring to let the West believe|he indeed had defected to them.
{59560}{59637}The truth is the Project Team|brought him here where...
{59639}{59715}...he's on pure science|instead of ''profitable'' science.
{59722}{59779}What if he decides he'd|rather go back to London?
{59780}{59829}Oh, we will take him home.
{59879}{59947}That young man is from|Project Team Eight.
{59949}{60030}The man with him is|Sergey Kievsky, the biologist.
{60073}{60151}l thought he took|political asylum in Canada.
{60154}{60188}So you read...
{60191}{60275}The Communists wrote he had taken|his family on a holiday to Egypt.
{60284}{60345}Actually, he is here.
{60392}{60443}Here is Dr. Okada.
{60449}{60529}This was shot three years ago|when he received the Nobel Prize.
{60779}{60862}Every nation in the world tried to|lure him into working forthem...
{60864}{60951}...or steal his discovery.|Malic is one of them.
{61053}{61125}These men are from|Project Team Fourteen...
{61128}{61207}...when they explained Latitude Zero|to him and his daughter.
{61209}{61249}That was last month.
{61252}{61297}And where are they now?
{61307}{61410}They are on their way to Hawaii by ship|to meet members of the Project Team.
{61701}{61735}Father!
{62645}{62692}The ship will radio for help.
{62705}{62815}Aid may come before Kroiga can|get to them aboard the Black Shark.
{62825}{62915}That's so none will risk firing for|fear of injuring our noted guest.
{62919}{63012}Besides, I think we can|count on Kroiga this time.
{63040}{63131}Captain, what's this Okada|done that's so important?
{63136}{63248}He developed a serum that can|immunize against radiation.
{63282}{63324}No wonder every nation wants it.
{63332}{63412}Any one government could immunize|its own population and destroy...
{63414}{63468}...all opposition with nuclear weapons.
{63471}{63558}That's why Dr. Okada has|refused to reveal his formula.
{63572}{63681}But even if these scientists here in|Latitude Zero invent something brilliant...
{63689}{63835}...how is it going to benefit mankind|if you keep the invention down here?
{63854}{63947}We've been thinking about that as well.
{63962}{64045}To encourage new discoveries,|we often secretly give...
{64048}{64140}...our scientific data to the|medical laboratories of the world.
{64509}{64612}The passenger liner en route|from Japan to Honolulu was...
{64615}{64740}...stopped on the high seas by a mysterious|submarine, identity not established.
{64746}{64865}And the Nobel Prize-winning bacteriologist,|Dr. Shogoro Okada and...
{64868}{64970}...his daughter, Tsuruko, were forcibly|taken from the ship by hostile...
{64973}{65013}...persons unknown.
{65016}{65164}...the kidnapping of the famous|scientist is intolerable!
{65194}{65310}At this very moment, our Ambassador|to the United Nations is...
{65318}{65427}...protesting to the Secretary|General about the high-handed act...
{65434}{65492}...of piracy of the United States.
{65496}{65564}...identity of the submarine|has not yet been confirmed.
{65567}{65615}But since it was not American...
{65617}{65716}...the evidence indicated it may have|been either of Soviet design or...
{65718}{65813}...a new aggressive step by Red China.|At the present time...
{65849}{65913}Any report from Project Team H?
{65917}{65988}Team H from Hawaii. Standby.
{65995}{66029}This is Yankton.
{66032}{66130}We have completed the arrangement|to bring the identical substitutes to SF...
{66133}{66213}...to cover Dr. Okada and|his daughter's disappearance...
{66216}{66272}...after taking them to El-Zee.
{66278}{66331}We're now waiting for instructions.
{66337}{66383}None now. Stay put.
{66470}{66523}No! I will tell you nothing!
{66589}{66670}Dr. Okada, you judge us wrongly.
{66681}{66785}If you'd stayed on that ship, you would|have spirited away to Latitude Zero...
{66788}{66843}...never to be heard from again.
{66856}{66908}We are willingly going to that place.
{66916}{66943}I see.
{66955}{67045}If that's your desire, I'll see to it|that you get there...
{67060}{67152}...as soon as you give me the|formula for the immunization serum.
{67155}{67178}Never.
{67236}{67335}Well, you're probably too upset|to think clearly right now.
{67338}{67421}Take a little rest, and|then we'll talk again.
{67475}{67538}Please, Doctor and Tsuruko-san.
{67825}{67920}Do I get a reward for|having brought them to you?
{67922}{68009}Of course, little one.|Just what did you have in mind?
{68013}{68058}To be alone with you.
{68065}{68138}It's been a long time.
{68154}{68180}Too long.
{68197}{68281}Come with me. l'll take you|where we can be together.
{68468}{68496}Kroiga...
{68573}{68620}Wait in here, little one.
{68781}{68808}Oh, no!
{68817}{68844}Malic...
{68872}{68911}Let me out, please!
{68913}{68972}What's that noise? What happened to her?
{68977}{69022}Nothing yet.
{69045}{69083}This way, please.
{69184}{69256}Please, this is our guest room.
{69637}{69738}You can rest here, Doctor,|and think about my proposition.
{69748}{69814}I will not cooperate|with you at any time.
{69833}{69910}Oh, you may change your mind.
{70160}{70210}They are my creations.
{70231}{70315}They will keep you company|for the next twelve hours.
{70409}{70509}Convince your father to cooperate,|or I'll turn you into a creature like that.
{70511}{70542}No, no...
{70561}{70604}You're a monster!
{70618}{70667}No, I am a genius.
{70692}{70760}If you continue to be|obstinate, Dr. Okada...
{70763}{70833}...you will force me to get|your formula in my own way...
{70845}{70944}...by surgically removing your brain,|and then dissecting its memory bank.
{70954}{70995}That's impossible!
{70999}{71038}Not for me.
{71060}{71108}You have twelve hours.
{71800}{71886}Now to let McKenzie know|that I have Dr. Okada...
{72071}{72124}It's originating from this building!
{72126}{72191}Yes, it's Okada.
{72211}{72308}How convenient that they|supplied him with a homing device.
{72312}{72415}Very good. It saves me the trouble|of telling McKenzie where Okada is.
{72420}{72501}-That will bring him here.|-Exactly what I want.
{72509}{72605}We're getting a signal on 87.4.|We'll have its location in a moment.
{72636}{72678}-This is McKenzie.|-Yes, Captain.
{72687}{72764}Have the modifications on the Alpha|I requested been completed?
{72768}{72840}The work is done, but testing will|require at least another day.
{72842}{72920}No time for testing.|She must be ready within one hour.
{72962}{72986}Thank you.
{73082}{73184}The signal is stabilized, therefore|they can't be on the Black Shark.
{73330}{73373}They have to be on Blood Rock.
{73376}{73441}No land or island shows at that point.
{73443}{73492}Small islands aren't shown on maps.
{73494}{73546}How is Dr. Okada sending a signal?
{73549}{73608}We gave him a homing device|before he left Tokyo.
{73610}{73713}Gentlemen, I had planned to return you to|the surface today, but it'll have to wait.
{73716}{73825}Anne, we'll select three men to|go with us on this rescue attempt.
{73836}{73896}What's the matter with us?
{73916}{73985}We're only alive because you saved us.
{73987}{74055}We know how to dive. Let us go with you.
{74077}{74115}I wouldn't miss it.
{74128}{74205}I must warn you the dangers|will be very great.
{74212}{74278}So, how do we start preparing for them?
{74312}{74367}You may need a doctor, Captain?
{74398}{74475}All right, but you'll remain|aboard the Alpha.
{74492}{74570}First, to the Bath of lmmunity.
{74610}{74642}The bath of what?
{74645}{74678}Don't ask me.
{74894}{74974}Now, you see, Gentlemen,|that's how it's done.
{75010}{75081}The immunity only lasts|for twenty-four hours.
{75390}{75459}Submerge for a count of three.
{75863}{75901}Uh, ladies first.
{75904}{75955}I think you'd better go first.
{76296}{76359}You know, l thought|we would look like Easter Eggs.
{76535}{76590}-You'd better be tested too.|-No...
{76727}{76763}Hey, look...
{76810}{76833}Ah, me?
{76906}{76962}l've been hit harder|with ping pong balls.
{77200}{77329}These are made of Corvexo...|an alloy of gold and platinum.
{77358}{77414}Impervious to all temperatures.
{77419}{77505}Hats are just an added precaution,|but you'd better put them on.
{77512}{77559}Then, we'll board the Alpha.
{77576}{77615}-Mr. Lawton.|-Thank you.
{77811}{77861}Have you changed your mind, Dr. Okada?
{77863}{77885}Never!
{77896}{77938}Do you expect to be rescued?
{77940}{78020}The people of Latitude Zero|already know where we are.
{78027}{78117}I certainly hope so. They've had|ample time to pinpoint your location.
{78129}{78218}I didn't take that homing device|away from you on purpose.
{78408}{78438}This is it.
{78499}{78530}Ingenious.
{78557}{78610}Much less obvious than others.
{78625}{78678}But they've served their purpose.
{78723}{78788}Bring them to the operating room.
{79063}{79127}El-zee, El-zee, this is the Alpha.
{79130}{79225}-This is El-zee.|-Are you still hearing the homing device?
{79230}{79283}It stopped, twelve seconds ago.
{79503}{79563}No...no...no...Malic...
{79567}{79612}Please, don't!
{79615}{79670}Please, no, Malic...
{79672}{79740}No, no, please...Malic!
{79743}{79781}Don't...don't...
{79784}{79850}No, Malic, help me!
{79863}{79926}Malic, don't...
{79997}{80086}You're a monster...a fiend...damn you!
{80091}{80174}I hope you die...die...die...
{80305}{80421}While we're waiting for the arrival of|your benefactor, l'll demonstrate my skill.
{80434}{80539}l am going to create a creature that|will kill Captain McKenzie for me.
{81242}{81293}This is the Helio Elevation Belt.
{81297}{81417}Rocket-powered, it permits a person to|climb to high altitudes very quickly.
{81436}{81478}Here is the safety.
{81498}{81538}Here's the trigger.
{81542}{81618}Now these are dangerous|and diverse weapons.
{81651}{81692}In the fingers.
{81744}{81824}The first finger emits a jet of fire.
{81831}{81878}-A miniature flame-thrower?|-Yes.
{81891}{81962}The second finger releases|a paralyzing gas...
{81976}{82026}...that immobilizes but does not kill.
{82029}{82086}But it won't immobilize ourselves?
{82091}{82166}The Bath of Immunity and|Corvexo suit will prevent that.
{82189}{82278}The third finger discharges a|laser beam that is lethal up to...
{82292}{82335}...one hundred meters.
{82351}{82434}Each finger is fired by|its own switch on the wrist.
{82438}{82549}Under no circumstances are you to use any|of these weapons unless I specifically...
{82552}{82602}...give you the order.
{82949}{83008}I can't stand it! No!
{83115}{83156}Can you see?
{83168}{83216}The brain of this lion.
{83425}{83511}Your doctors are so elated that|they have finally been able to...
{83513}{83586}...transplant organs|from one human to another.
{83589}{83632}That's child's play.
{83635}{83737}I'm now going to transplant a human|brain into the head of this lion.
{83744}{83824}My God, no! Don't kill that woman!
{83835}{83930}Think of it, Dr. Okada, a|human's brain in a savage beast!
{83946}{84022}lt will be able to understand|and obey my orders.
{84024}{84114}Ah, what a marvelous creature|this is going to be!
{84133}{84196}I beg you.|Don't do such a terrible thing!
{84199}{84282}I'll give you the formula.|Only stop this, and let her go!
{84290}{84345}It's too late, Doctor.
{84632}{84717}There is a ledge below at eighty feet.
{84742}{84879}After we leave, submerge and|let the Alpha settle on it.
{85244}{85337}The Alpha has surfaced|beside the cliff wall.
{85350}{85423}Administer the anesthetic to the condor.
{85548}{85597}You are to remain on that ledge...
{85600}{85668}...until you receive a radio signal|from me to surface.
{85692}{85766}If you fail to receive|that signal by dusk...
{85820}{85899}...you are to return to|Latitude Zero immediately.
{85916}{85969}Is that understood? Immediately.
{85972}{86006}Yes, Captain.
{86164}{86191}Be careful.
{86207}{86228}Yeah.
{87531}{87563}Malic, look!
{87734}{87776}McKenzie has arrived!
{87777}{87866}Now watch and see what happens|to him and his little group.
{88104}{88168}The moon looks a lot more|inviting than this place.
{88171}{88224}Captain, you've never been here before?
{88229}{88252}First time.
{88262}{88317}How are we going to find Dr. Okada?
{88320}{88365}Could be in that tower.
{88380}{88428}It looks like this is the way down.
{88683}{88710}My legs...
{88712}{88749}What is this?
{88790}{88839}lt's a strong magnetic force.
{88876}{88936}lt has locked the lever|on our elevation belts!
{89198}{89217}Captain!
{89253}{89359}Kobo, try to pull us out. One at a time.
{89454}{89497}They're getting loose!
{89625}{89645}Malic.
{89653}{89708}Be quiet. This is important.
{89868}{89924}Kroiga, do you hear me?
{89957}{90054}You see, Dr. Okada! My new|creation even knows its name!
{90083}{90193}And this amplification serum will increase|the size of it at least three times.
{90197}{90249}All within a few minutes.
{90433}{90487}Kroiga! Come here!
{90559}{90648}lt cannot be...|a beast with the brain of a human!
{90819}{90895}Go! Find McKenzie and kill him!
{90969}{91022}Yes! Kill McKenzie!
{91025}{91094}You understand? Kill him!
{91181}{91268}Now Dr. Okada, it is your turn.
{91317}{91355}No, no!
{91600}{91628}Silence her!
{92016}{92033}Hurry!
{92674}{92712}Doctor, doctor!
{92729}{92761}Are you all right?
{92948}{92996}I suppose you should be all right.
{93002}{93037}You're right.
{93511}{93536}Rats!
{94354}{94403}Go back to the entrance of the tunnel!
{94937}{94981}Let's go through this space.
{96104}{96143}Maybe we can wade across.
{96166}{96193}I'll go.
{96598}{96645}Let's get his boots off, Ken.
{96658}{96690}Knife!
{96964}{96999}Captain, Captain!
{97401}{97432}Can you walk?
{97434}{97463}l'm okay.
{97481}{97522}Jules, get back here.
{97544}{97596}Grab him. Two on each side.
{97615}{97661}Activate your elevation belts!
{98642}{98669}Kroiga!
{98711}{98736}Kroiga!
{98798}{98893}Kroiga was a fool as a woman.|ls she also a fool as a griffin!?
{99170}{99238}Shall we start, Dr. Okada?
{99283}{99383}Please, please don't hurt my father!
{99926}{99972}-Break the lock, Kobo.|-Yes, Captain.
{100290}{100322}Pass me a syringe.
{100513}{100540}McKenzie!
{101258}{101284}Lucretia!
{101334}{101360}Lucretia...
{101393}{101439}Forgive me.
{101467}{101512}I didn't mean to kill you.
{101518}{101551}I know.
{101632}{101662}Malic...
{101797}{101821}Kill him!
{103368}{103403}Ah! Malic!
{104519}{104546}Thank you!
{104555}{104580}Thank you.
{104591}{104613}Father!
{104615}{104644}Tsuruko!
{104681}{104707}Father!
{104732}{104795}-Are you Captain McKenzie?|-We'll talk later, Dr. Okada.
{104803}{104841}Malic has escaped.
{104846}{104899}We must hurry back to the Alpha.
{104947}{104967}Captain!
{106863}{106958}This is Dr. Okada, and this is Tsuruko.|Dr. Barton will assist you.
{106961}{106995}Nice to meet you.
{106999}{107048}Where's Jules...Dr. Masson?
{107058}{107123}He's still up there|with Kobo and Mr. Lawton.
{107139}{107187}We have to go back to help them down.
{107190}{107255}-Are they all right?|-Yes, but Malic has escaped.
{107258}{107280}Ready!
{107283}{107298}Yes.
{107815}{107850}Is that what l think it is?
{107853}{107884}The Black Shark!
{107888}{107911}Let's go!
{108586}{108620}Inside, everybody!
{108623}{108635}Hurry!
{110592}{110664}Try to overcome this force, my friend!
{110700}{110750}We are being pulled by a|strong magnetic force.
{110810}{110895}We're in a magnetic field|coming from that cliff!
{111334}{111383}-Prepare the laser gun.|-Yes, sir.
{111427}{111542}l'm going to destroy the Alpha and|everyone on her, piece by piece!
{111701}{111756}-Cling to something...|-What's going to happen?
{111759}{111828}We'll test a modification|made just before we left.
{111830}{111905}Kobo, activate bow rudders.
{111922}{111948}Yes, Captain.
{112238}{112298}lf this works, we're going to fly.
{112342}{112360}Fly?
{112546}{112583}Now or never.
{112920}{112940}Fire!
{112948}{112969}Fire!
{113279}{113345}Shoot it down! Shoot it down!
{113890}{113922}Move!
{114122}{114167}Out of my way!
{114249}{114297}Sir! We are being pulled to land!
{114300}{114328}Don't bother me!
{114756}{114881}How ironic. lt looks like the Black Shark|has been caught in the magnetic field!
{115383}{115433}Sir, look out!
{117033}{117068}We did it!
{119216}{119321}I've told them goodbye and l wished them|luck which l figure they've already found.
{119334}{119389}A logical conclusion|for a good reporter.
{119392}{119423}Have a chair.
{119434}{119454}Thank you.
{119459}{119541}I suppose you're anxious to|get back to your own world.
{119543}{119622}Well, with the terrific story l've got,|plus the pictures to prove it...
{119626}{119740}...and a tobacco pouch full of diamonds,|it's the only place to go.
{119746}{119794}Uh, Captain McKenzie...
{119806}{119921}You said everything invented down here|is used forthe benefit of mankind, right?
{119993}{120090}When are you going to let the rest|of the world know about this secret?
{120103}{120189}Mr. Lawton, unfortunately we don't know.
{120194}{120308}But we do believe that the day all men|in the world live in harmony will come.
{120328}{120421}Until then, we must|continue our work here.
{120513}{120592}Kobo, arrange to return|Mr. Lawton to the surface.
{120594}{120626}Yes, Captain.
{120636}{120663}Good luck.
{120670}{120696}Thank you.
{121427}{121480}Captain, excuse me.
{121510}{121585}How much longer before the|spacecraft splashes down, Captain?
{121587}{121689}The American officers aboard tell us|that re-entry should begin at...
{121693}{121735}...eleven hundred hours.
{121738}{121817}Raft adrift off starboard bow, sir!
{121984}{122014}Oh, over there!
{122119}{122155}I've told you already.
{122158}{122250}Dr. Tashiro and Dr. Masson|decided to remain in Latitude Zero.
{122262}{122292}I told the captain...
{122294}{122359}-At the bottom of the ocean?|-Yeah, it's the truth!
{122364}{122417}Those scientists who we think are dead...
{122420}{122506}...are alive and studying|down there. I saw them!
{122859}{122888}What is this?
{122891}{122963}He seems to think I'm Dr. Tashiro.
{122991}{123028}lf you please, Gentlemen...
{123057}{123121}l'll be in the radio room|with Lt. Hastings.
{123123}{123152}Thank you.
{123270}{123305}What are you doing here?
{123308}{123388}I'm temporarily assigned|to this ship to observe the...
{123390}{123466}...pick-up of a space-craft,|Commander Glenn McKenzie.
{123473}{123556}You look exactly like|Captain Craig McKenzie.
{123722}{123807}Now, you can see for yourself|the pictures l took!
{123904}{123955}-Nothing on this film.|-What?
{124088}{124113}Look...
{124124}{124138}What?
{124146}{124226}That's his lousy darkroom|that ruined my film.
{124236}{124292}I took pictures of everything there.
{124318}{124345}Wait a minute!
{124394}{124441}l can prove it to you.
{124578}{124615}You see this...
{124979}{125036}It was full of diamonds.
{125072}{125127}Captain McKenzie gave them to me.
{125150}{125199}I come from a long line of McKenzies.
{125201}{125289}But I don't know anyone in my family who|was rich enough to give away diamonds.
{125320}{125382}Lt. Hastings, bring a corpsman|to the wardroom.
{125384}{125402}Right, sir.
{125405}{125429}Thank you.
{125446}{125582}Until this mission is completed,|you will be cared for in sick bay.
{125635}{125681}But I'm not sick!
{125696}{125782}You are all so hung up|on exploring space.
{125785}{125904}You're not even interested in learning|about a miracle that exists on our own planet.
{125914}{126021}When this miracle that|you have seen is demonstrated...
{126048}{126113}...we'll be most interested, Mr. Lawton.
{126167}{126214}Here's the patient, Lt. Hastings.
{126343}{126368}But you...
{126398}{126445}-Bring him to a sick bay.|-Yes, sir.
{126883}{126925}Telegram, Captain.
{127069}{127129}It's from New York Bank to Perry Lawton.
{127140}{127174}Listen to this...
{127189}{127292}''Have received six hundred karats|of diamonds from unknown sender...
{127295}{127382}''...instructing we hold for safe|keeping pending your return.''
{127394}{127445}How did they know|he was aboard this ship?
{127447}{127544}At any rate, he is|the richest man aboard.
{127566}{127618}Here is one from SOPAC, sir.
{127622}{127736}The rendez-vous area is now Tango X-Ray|for splash-down of the spacecraft.
{127739}{127795}Ask the captain to change course.
{127799}{127821}Captain!
{127851}{127909}Longitude one seven six.
{127926}{127960}One seven six.
{127963}{127989}Latitude...
{128004}{128031}Latitude...
{128051}{128070}Zero.
{128081}{128101}Zero.
{128491}{128578}THE END
