# I dream of not a ray of sun 
# A moment 
# And then the empty dawn 
# Awakens the lonely heart broken 
# A warm embrace 
# A fleeting smile 
# A whisper 
# And then the dream has gone 
# With most of the words left unspoken 
# Each lonely day when I awaken 
# I could not face the empty dawn 
# For I know 
# That my heart has been forsaken 
# A dream of love was all I knew 
# That moment before the empty dawn 
# Awakened my lonely heart broken... # 
DOOR CREAKS 
Tequila. 
- Is he having a dance? 
- Five-ace card player. 
STRUGGLES FOR BREATH 
Five dollars he doesn't last another minute. 
- Cut him down. 
- You stay out of this, Yank. We'll cut him down when he quits kicking. 
Ugh! 
Billy... Get in, boy! 
LAUGHTER 
GUNSHOT 
LAUGHTER CONTINUES 
Where have you been, Billy? 
GUNSHOTS 
- You'd better ride with us. 
- There ain't no Yellowleg Yankee boy goin' with us! 
I hear they got a new bank and an old marshal over at Gila City. 
- That beats cheatin' at cards, don't it?
- Let's go. 
The town looks quiet. 
Yeah, I bet the marshal's asleep. 
Ever shoot a man in his sleep, Yellowlegs? You bein' a Yankee? 
He ain't very sociable, is he? Been with us a week and ain't lost his temper once. 
- I never did trust a man who didn't lose his temper. Let's go. 
- We ain't takin' the bank today. 
- Are you givin' the orders now? 
- Looks that way, don't it? 
- Billy, get him in the back. 
- No, Turkey, that ain't my style. 
Come on, he's askin' for it, boy. 
Any man that'd turn his back on you is just a dag blam fool. 
I kinda like him. 
I never knowed a Yankee before. 
PLAYS MOURNFUL TUNE 
Hey, Mead! THEY CHANT TAUNTINGLY 
CONTINUES PLAYING TUNE 
CHILDREN LAUGHING 
Your horse needs a shoe. 
There's a blacksmith's shop. 
- How long do you figure that money's gonna keep?
- Till I tell you when. 
- I'm kinda anxious to get my hands on it.
- Take care of your horse first. 
I was figurin' on havin' a couple of drinks with you fellas. 
I sure hope this town has some pretty girls in it. 
When you get this far out in the brush, they're all pretty. 
Billy, take the horses round to the livery stables. 
Uh... 
Are you talkin' to me? 
Your name's Billy, ain't it? 
I'll take the horses for you, mister. 
Well, you look like an honest man. 
You know, some folks is just born lucky, I guess. 
Doggone it, you know, don't push yours! 
What's going on here? 
These don't look too pretty to me. 
I told you, you ain't been out here long enough. 
Hey! 
Hey, hey, wait a minute. Put that thing back up. 
- That'll have to wait, gents. 
- Wait? Wait for what? 
Church is about to start. The parson don't like to look at it during his sermon. 
- This ain't Sunday, is it?
- That's a matter of opinion in Gila City. 
We haven't seen a calendar in two years. Some folks hold it's Monday, but these folks hold it's Sunday. 
- Are you gents lookin' for a drink? 
- I'm lookin' right at it. What's in that bottle? 
- Best we've got. Even the Mayor drinks it.
- That'll have to do. 
- Tell me somethin'. How about the bank?
- The bank's open. They're Monday folks. 
The bar's closed when the parson walks in. 
Howdy, mister! 
Hello, boy. 
Hey, that's what I call pretty. 
- Who's she, the redhead?
- Works over at the dance hall across the street. 
Imagine comin' in here like she was respectable and bringin' her woods colt with her! 
- Imagine!
- She wouldn't know his father if she saw him again. 
- Poor boy.
- I imagine it's as close as she ever was to a parson. 
And her holding a prayer book like she was respectable! 
If they're going to heaven, let's you and me not go! 
Gents, the bar is closed. 
Number 23. 
# Rock of ages, cleft for me 
# Let me hide myself in thee 
# Let the water and the blood 
# From thy wounded side which flowed 
# Be of sin the double cure 
# Save from wrath and make me pure 
# Could my tears forever flow 
# Could my zeal no languor know 
# All for sin could not atone... # 
- What are y'all drinkin'? 
- No drinkin'. The bar's closed on account of the church meeting. 
- Whisky. - I told them the bar's... 
Billy, show 'em those six-shooters! 
See how fast you can take the cork out of that bottle. 
I wanna tell you somethin'. He's fast with them six-shooters. This boy's a real comin' boy. 
I taught him everythin' I know. 
- What's the matter?
- You'll have to stand and look at that bottle all the way through the sermon. 
# Let me hide myself in thee... # 
Lord, I see you sent us some new faces today. 
Male... and female. 
Lord, I thank you, and folks, I welcome you. 
And I'll be dishin' out the gospels in a minute. 
But first, I've got to say a word to you gents with your hats on. 
This here is a preach-house, gents, and you'll take your hats off to the Lord. 
Mister, I never met a man who wouldn't take off his hat to the Lord. 
Let's get it off. 
You get on with your preachin'. 
- He's touchy about that hat. 
- I've never seen nothin' like it. He don't even take it off to sleep. 
We'll have a moment of silent prayer. 
Yes... 
All that money just sittin' out there across the street. 
I've never known a man so hungry for money. I think you're studyin' up to be a miser. 
Studyin' up to buy us an army. Don't you remember? 
- Still dreamin' about that? 
- It ain't such a dream. 
We could set up our own republic on this country. It's wide open. Nobody can stop us. 
Take that bank money and the Comancheros will sell us 100, maybe 200 slave Indians. 
We put uniforms on 'em. 
Yeah, fix us up an army. 
And I could drill 'em. 
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hooray, hooray 
# When Johnny comes marching home again... # 
Left face, right face... 
# Johnny comes marching... # 
Mm-hm. 
Raise this arm. 
Raise it. Higher. 
Mm-hm. All right. 
- Has it always pained you that way? 
- Almost always. 
That ball ought to come out of there. 
That's what I'm here for. 
- Have you ever been in Springfield, Ohio?
- No. 
I'll swear I've seen you someplace before. 
Here... 
How long will this lay me up? 
- It's pretty close to the collarbone. A thing like that won't heal overnight, you know.
- What, a week? 
More like a month. 
Well, I got a little business to attend to. 
I don't think it can wait that long. 
Then stop wasting my time. 
Wait a minute. 
Missoura. That's where it was. 
A fella just about your size, Yellowleg sergeant. 
Somebody had tried to scalp him. A liquored-up Johnny Reb with a Bowie knife. 
He cut the sergeant up pretty badly before he was scared off by something. 
You know, if you take off your hat, you could make me out a liar. 
It's you, all right. 
You certainly went out of your way to look me up, didn't you? Take off the hat. 
I've kind of got used to keeping it on. 
Why? You haven't got anything to hide but a few battle scars. A lot of the boys came out with worse than that. 
- What did you do after the war ended? 
- What would YOU do? 
- I'd go after that Reb. 
- Well, I found him. 
Is that Reb in town? 
Well, what are you waiting for? 
I'm waiting to get him alone. 
You see, I want him to know who I am. 
I want him to know he's gonna get what he gave me. 
Are you sure you found the right man? 
Yeah, I'm sure. I left my teeth marks in his scalping hand. 
And I'm askin' you, my friends... 
Any man, woman or child that reckons that he wants to go to hell, 
I say let that man, woman or child stand up and be counted! 
What? 
Start countin', Parson. Get up, Turk. 
You white-livered coyote, you're saying you intend to go to that place? 
I sure do, Parson. I'll tell you somethin' else. 
Any man that don't get on his feet right now and join me is goin' there pronto! 
GUNSHOTS AND SCREAMING 
Well, nice to meet you, ma'am. My name's Billy. Billy Keplinger. 
Get out! 
GASPS AND SCREAMS 
Come on, Turkey! 
Sure is a pretty girl. 
Ma'am, I want to thank you for your fortitude. 
We'll all close with a prayer now for those poor, misguided men. 
All that money just sittin' there, waitin' on a Yellowlegged Yankee. 
I never saw a man so patient about robbin' a bank! 
Oh, church meeting's over. 
You have a nice afternoon. 
Thank you again, ma'am. 
STARTS PLAYING MOURNFUL TUNE 
Let me know when that Yankee's patience runs out. 
If his patience ever does wear out. 
That pretty redhead that just went in holds that today is Sunday. 
What do you lovely creatures feel about that? 
I think it's Monday. 
- Get your horse.
- Huh? 
Get it. 
Billy! 
Hey, Billy! Yellowleg's ready. 
GUNSHOTS 
SHOUTING AND GUNSHOTS 
Somethin' wrong with that Yankee's shootin' arm. 
Somebody get the doc. 
He's dead. 
It was them outlaws, Kit. They did some wild shootin'. 
No. 
It was me. 
- 'Is she the dance hall woman? 
- That's her. 
'Imagine comin' in here like she was respectable, bringin' her woods colt with her! 
- 'Imagine!
- She wouldn't know his father if she saw him again. 
- 'Poor boy.
- I imagine it's as close as she ever was to a parson. 
'And her holding the prayer book like she was respectable!' 
That Yellowleg sure has been tryin' to get hisself drunk. 
He ain't quite makin' it though. 
Some men are like that. Give me two. 
The boy's leanin' awful hard on him. 
You reckon the Mayor will be able to talk that redhead into changin' her mind? 
Ain't nothin' gonna change her mind. 
She got Doc Acton to take care of the body and rented herself a wagon. She's goin' tonight. 
Goin' alone if she has to. 
We've come to change your mind, Kit. 
We've decided to have a nice funeral for the boy in Gila City. 
The whole town will come. As Mayor, I'll see to it. 
Mead will be buried in Siringo next to his father. 
Now, Kit... 
Bury him here? You think I haven't heard all the whispering? 
- You and your gossiping little wives with their pinched little faces and their noses in the air!
- Miss Kit... 
"That dance hall woman with her freckle-faced woods colt. 
"No telling who the father might be!" 
They smell brimstone every time I walk by. 
They hated us both, me and the boy. 
Well, he's dead now and you can tell your wives that there was no sinning and there'll be no funeral. 
I'm taking him to Siringo. 
You can't do that. It's smack in the middle of Apache country and there ain't nobody willing to go with you. 
Besides, there's not much of it left but the weeds. 
I've tried, Kit. I've asked everybody. 
I'm not asking anybody to go with me. 
Poor Kit. She's trying mighty hard to make folk believe about the boy's pa. 
- Are you a single man?
- Married. 
- I didn't know that, Cal. 
Well, almost married. 
Me and Emma. She wouldn't let me go with Kit. Not that way. 
Not to mention the Apaches. 
I ain't never seen a town so full of cowards. 
I ain't never seen a town so scared of Indians. 
TURK CHUCKLES 
You can take three. 
Kit? 
I hate to think what all that sun will do to your face. 
Will you take this? 
No, thanks, Cal. 
Take it. I've got no use for it. I can't sell it. 
Imported all the way from St Louis. 
Get down from there! 
I said get down! 
- Somebody's got to drive this for you.
- Not you. 
I'm askin' to. 
I said get down! 
Need any help, ma'am? 
- Get out of here, Billy. 
- I didn't mean to butt in... 
Your place. 
Get down. 
I bet she don't get 20 miles before she turns around. 
50 dollars. 
And a call. 
What have you got? 
You lose to four aces. 
- We're leaving town.
- You're a little premature, Yellowleg. 
Get your horses. 
Billy and me like this town. We're stickin' around. You'd better leave alone cos we ain't leavin'. 
It wasn't me that shot that boy. 
Get up. Get up! 
Looks like you and me is gonna go to Siringo. 
Billy, you and I ain't leavin' here. 
I'm just backin' him up. 
Yeah, I kinda like the idea of going to Siringo with that redhead. 
Come on. What's the matter? 
Come on! 
I guess you don't mind the Yellowleg orderin' you around, but I don't like it. 
But if I could handle that six-shooter like you, Billy boy... 
His back's pointin' right at ya. What's the matter? Scared? 
Scared he might hear your gun comin' out of the holster? 
That ain't no fit way to kill a man. 
Not even a Yankee. 
There she is. 
Yah! Yah! 
- Good morning, ma'am.
- You'll kill your horse pushin' him like that. 
- Will you let me drive that wagon for you?
- I don't want YOUR help! 
Well, I'd be mighty proud to ride in that wagon with you, ma'am. 
Leave me alone! 
Both of you. 
Well, now, you know it ain't exactly safe out here for a woman? 
Well, it ain't exactly safe for you either. 
Any of you. Now git! 
Why don't you leave this woman be and let's head back? 
Yaah! 
Listen, that bank is probably just now opening up. 
Yeah, it probably is, probably is. 
We'll follow along and see she gets through. 
Turkey, that's a woman! 
Come on, let's go. 
Your dress is kinda wet. I guess you're gonna have to dry it out. 
It shouldn't take long in this heat. 
I never did see a dance-hall girl so touchy about gettin' kissed. 
You stay away from me. 
What will you do with that rock? Use it on me? 
Or a shotgun if I have to! 
Well, ma'am, I always did go for high stakes. 
Apaches. 
They scalped him. 
Yeah. It looks like they did. 
Come on, let's get back to that wagon. 
Hey, the coffee's ready! 
It's plain to see that woman don't want us round here, so why don't we accommodate her by leaving? 
Did you desert? 
- Hmm? 
- Did you desert the Rebel Army? 
I don't remember telling you I was in the army. 
I figured you for a deserter. 
How did you guess? 
Maybe I ought to take her a cup of coffee before it gets cold. 
Leave her alone. 
Are you... Are you talkin' to me? 
Hey, Billy, I think Yellowleg's kinda taken a shine to that woman. 
- And we thought he was feelin' sorry about that boy.
- Shut up! 
- Touchy too.
- Yeah. 
Like he is about that hat he keeps wearin'. 
- You know what I think he's got under it?
- What's that? 
Money. 
Well, there's one way we could find out. 
We can ask him... 
Take your hat off, Yellowlegs. 
He's scared of you, Billy. 
Yellowlegs... 
Take your hat off or I'll shoot it off. 
You try it and I'll kill you. 
BILLY LAUGHS 
Yellowlegs, there's something about you I just gotta like. 
Better mind your thinkin', kid. Yellowleg has done got his claim staked out. 
We could go back to that bank. That posse would never follow us out here, not to Siringo. 
We could set up our own little republic like that Edward fella did down in Texas. 
You know, the republic of Freedonia? 
All this land out here, just a-waitin'. Think how you'd look in a gold braid uniform! 
You're the kind of trigger-happy young fella I can use. 
I'd make you my military aide. 
Then we'd start makin' up a lot of laws, but not one of them would apply to us. 
- They don't now. They never did. 
- There's money in a thing like this. 
If it's run right. But we've got to start first with that bank back in Gila City. 
Turkey, don't you ever shut up? You nag like an old woman! 
It's sure quiet out here, isn't it? 
I don't blame you for feelin' the way you do, but right now, it might be a good idea if you could make out like we were getting along. 
Are you always that stubborn or just hard to figure out? 
Lady... 
I'm just tryin' to help. 
Who are you trying to help? 
Riding shotgun on this wagon isn't going to buy you a clean conscience! 
I'm beginning to wonder if you ever figured on going to Siringo at all. 
What are you trying to say? 
I mean, right here is as good as Siringo for the boy. 
You don't have to prove anything to me. 
Damn you! 
- Look at 'em fightin'!
- Yeah. 
You don't know me well enough to hate me that much. 
Hating is a subject I know a little something about. 
You've got to be careful it don't bite you back. 
I know somebody who spent five years looking for a man he hated. 
Hating and wanting revenge was all that kept him alive. 
He spent all them years tracking that other man down, and when he caught up with him, it was the worst day in his life. 
He'd get his revenge all right, but then he'd lose the one thing he had to live for. 
GUNSHOT 
- What was that for? 
- I was just checking my aim. 
Nothing like letting the Apaches know where we are! 
That ain't no fit way to kill a man, not even a Yankee. 
You go on up ahead and find us a place to camp. 
- There might be some Apaches out there.
- Then you go find out. 
You know, you could get the sun here. 
I'll get used to it. 
We'll be leaving you in Siringo. You can find your own way back. 
DISTANT HOWLS 
Come on. 
Turk, what are you doin' out here? This ain't your guard. 
I want to show you somethin'. 
I've been carryin' this around with me for a long while. 
- What's that? 
- It's a genuine general's cap. 
I stole it over at San Antonio. I never did show it to anybody before. 
A man sure really looks like something wearin' one of these, don't he, boy? 
Huh? 
If you're waitin' for me to salute you, you're gonna wait a long time. 
Here, I want to show you something else. 
Here... Come here. 
See that part right there? 
It's not on a regular map. A valley. Not many people know it's there. 
We're gonna buy ourselves some slave Indians. We're gonna put uniforms on and we're gonna fill 'em good. 
We'll be able to burn a fire path through this country from Tucson to Tucumcari. 
What do you say, boy? Huh? 
What do you say to that, huh? 
Fine, Turk, fine. 
Um... 
Take over my guard for me, will you? 
I never travelled with a lady before. 
It kinda appeals to me. 
- Get out of my way. 
- Maybe I will and maybe I won't. 
I'm telling you to leave me alone. 
I don't wanna... I don't wanna trouble you, Kit. 
I just wanna be sociable. 
And I never wear my guns when I make a social call. 
I always did like pretty things and... 
You're just about the prettiest I've ever seen. 
HE LAUGHS 
Saddle up. 
Come on, get out of here. 
- I'm goin' with you, Billy. 
- You ain't goin' no place.
- Huh? 
- You're stayin' right here. 
- He wouldn't stand a chance in Apache country alone.
- That's his lookout. 
COYOTE HOWLS 
Turk! 
He's gone. 
- They'll be going back to Gila City, both of them. I'll drive you back if you want.
- No, thanks. 
You still going to Siringo? 
- You think you can stop me? 
- Lady, I wouldn't even try. 
Aaaiee! 
I, uh... 
I'm sorry about losing the horse. 
- Well, you don't have to talk to me, you know!
- It ain't worth the effort. 
Five years is a long time to turn your back on, especially for a woman like me. That's what you think. 
- Lady, I quit thinking when I turned my horse around.
- Stop calling me Lady! My name is Kit. 
- I don't know you well enough! 
- Don't think you're fooling me. 
You're not half as mad at me as you are at yourself. 
Gonna talk all the way to Siringo? 
Ha! 
GUNFIRE AND WAR CRIES 
Grab that shotgun! Come on! 
GUNFIRE CONTINUES 
Must have ambushed that stage down at the border. 
YELLING AND WHOOPING 
I sure wish I could take a bath. 
Well, nothing's stopping you. 
Come on. 
Want some more? 
You know...I can hardly remember what my husband looked like. 
We were only married a few weeks. We were on our way to Gila City when he was... 
..he was killed in Siringo. 
When Mead was born, they wouldn't believe me. 
Gila City put a brand on both of us. 
With their...jokes and their...talk and their ugly little smiles. 
Getting dark. 
We've got to have another horse. 
Them Apaches can't be far off. They've got plenty of horses. 
You wait right here until I get back. 
SHOUTS AND CONFUSION 
CONTINUES FIRING 
Whoa. 
Kit! 
Pack up. We're moving out. 
Whoa. 
That's far enough. 
I don't think I can stay awake another minute. 
You'll have to. 
Start digging. 
- What?! 
- We're going to bury the wagon. 
Our trail's got to look Indian. If we're lucky, those Apaches are still trying to find their stagecoach. 
Getting tired? 
I didn't ask for any help. 
I wasn't offering any. I just asked if you were getting tired. 
Is Yellowleg a name? 
Well, it'll do. 
- Where are you from?
- Ohio. 
Is it pretty back there? 
Used to be. 
What are you doing? 
Do and I'll kill you. 
What is it? 
Apache. 
- How could he miss?
- He didn't. 
Well, why didn't he kill us? 
He's got a little score to settle up with me first. 
Start packing up. 
- Can't forgive me for making you give up those five years, can you? 
- I'll pick up his trail again. 
Hardly seemed worth the trouble. 
HORSE STIRS 
There you go. 
RATTLESNAKE HISSES 
He broke it. 
SINGLE SHOT 
What is he waiting for? Why doesn't he kill us? 
He will when he's ready. 
- Why don't you kill us and get it over with?! Come on!
- Stop it! 
- Leave me alone!
- Shut up!
- Why do you let him torture us?
- Shut up! 
Our Apache friend's been awful quiet. Maybe he got bit by a snake. 
- Do you think it's much further? 
- What?
- Siringo. 
- Siringo what?
- Do you think...? 
Strange. 
I feel I know you better than any man I've ever known. 
Yet I hardly know you at all. 
- What are you trying to do? 
- You're hurting me! 
- What did you expect to find? 
I was only trying to make you more comfortable. 
I'm sorry. 
HORSE WHINNIES 
Sorry... 
There's...some things about me you don't understand. 
You killed the only person I loved in this whole world. 
That's all I need to know about YOU. 
Next time I'll be waiting for him. 
Inside. 
Go on. 
This'll do. 
Here. 
You've got enough buckshot in there to stop an army. 
He ought to be on top of the bluff by sundown, so I'll wait for him. 
If I'm not back by morning, you're on your own. 
Wait. 
I...just wanted to say... 
..thank you. 
RUMBLE OF THUNDER 
THUNDER GROWS LOUDER 
- Aaaiee!
- Ungh! 
Aaargh! 
Where is it? By the mission? 
What was your husband's name? 
Mead Tildon. My son was named after him. 
I couldn't find it. 
It's there. 
No, there ain't nobody named Tildon buried there. 
You're just the same as all the rest of them. 
Here it is. 
It must be one of the others. 
Kit! 
Kit! I found it! 
I found it. 
Yellowleg. 
- Where's Turk? 
- Right behind you. 
When Billy gets hold of an idea, he just won't let go of it. Especially a red-headed woman. 
Well, there's no need to keep the lady out here in the sunshine. 
Let's step inside and talk things over. 
Sorry I can't offer you folks a drink. 
- What did you do with the money? 
- Money? What money? 
- Only one thing would bring him down here - keeping ahead of a posse.
- I never saw folks so scared of Injuns. 
I tell you, she sure is pretty. 
Turkey, go get that money. 
- Are you crazy?
- Go on. Do what I told you to do. 
- You know, I...I just ain't got the heart to kill him.
- Huh? 
How would you like to have your gun back? 
- You want me to do it? 
- I'll be much obliged. 
- Just the minute he walks back through this door.
- What about her? 
We'll decide that later. You and me. 
Well, I'm going for a little walk. I'll be around. 
The lady's got to admit I got guts. 
You'd better get out of here. 
- You can't! 
- I've waited five years. The waiting is over. Now keep out of it. 
What happened to Mead was an accident. I know that now, even though I thought that I could never forgive you for it. 
But I could never love a man who was a cold-blooded killer. 
Love? 
You don't even know me. 
I'm a face under a hat. 
Ever wonder why I won't take this off? 
- Want to talk about love? 
- I've seen you with your hat off. 
What about MY scars? 
Do you know how many men I've let kiss me just because their filthy money gave them the right? 
Men with dirty shirts, smelly arms, money in their pockets. 
Can those scars be forgotten? 
Can I ask you to love a... 
..a woman like that? 
Now don't that make a pretty picture? 
Where's Billy? 
- Out of the way.
- Don't do it! 
All this shooting and he ain't even touched him yet. 
Turkey... 
Billy! Are you crazy?! 
All right, Yellowleg. This is it. 
- You and me.
- Move out, Billy. Move out. I ain't got time for you. 
There ain't but two horses in this town. You know only two people are gonna ride out of here alive. 
You turned on me, Billy. And I raised him from a puppy. 
I'm not giving him this money. 
No... 
Get me some slave Indians... I'll train them myself. 
Take all this money... 
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH 
Yellowleg, Yellowleg, listen to me. We can make ourselves a deal. 
I don't want that Billy with me. I want you! Look at you. I put you in that uniform. 
Now come on, listen to reason. 
Why can't a Yankee join up with a Rebel? 
We could do it together. Look at all this money here. Look. I'll give it all to you. 
I'll make a general out of you. General Yellowleg. Think of how you'd look in one of these caps... 
Listen, Yellowleg, like I told you up there... 
- You're gonna be in my army. I'll make a general out of you with gold braid.
- Remember that? 
You know where you left it, don't you? 
- Chickamauga.
- Look at it. 
- No... Oh, Yellowleg, listen to me, I don't want that Billy...
- Look at me! 
Yellowleg, I'll make a general out of you. You'll look good in that gold braid. Listen to me... 
- Oh...
- Don't! 
Get out of here! 
Don't do it! 
Aah! 
(TURK) Billy! 
Billy! 
You tell Yellowleg it's a fact I got soldiers! 
HORSES APPROACH 
Hi. We're trailing a couple of bank robbers. You got one of them. 
- Where's the other?
- Inside. Looks like they figured you didn't have guts enough to come here. 
- You know how people are. If it's their money, the gates of hell wouldn't stop them.
- Sure. 
Parson, we're going to need a few of the right kind of words from you. 
- We're burying a boy alongside of his dad.
- I'll say the right words. 
- This is a convoy.
- Yes, sir. 
- Gentlemen, you're going to make great officers in my army. 
I'll soon have your uniforms for you. Gold braid. And then we'll start training... 
Thank you, sir. Well, Captain, if you'll say, "Forward, yo!" to these ranks, we'll go. 
Forward, yo! 
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah 
# When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah... # 
Fill up those ranks! 
Forward march! Follow me, men! 
We'll get us an army, we know what to do. 
We buy some slave Indians... 
# Each day when I awaken 
# No more I face the empty dawn 
# For I know that my heart is not forsaken 
# The dream of love that once I knew 
# Now lingers beyond the empty dawn 
# No more is my lonely heart broken... #
There's an old story.
The way the Apaches tell it...
...a man was riding in the desert and came across a vulture...
...the kind they call turkey buzzards in Arizona, sittin' on a rock.
"Hey," the man says, "how come you old turkey buzzard's sittin' here?
"I saw you flying over Hadleyberg, and I didn't want to meet up with you...
"...so I turned around and come this way."
Old turkey buzzard says:
"That's funny,
I was only passing through that town.
"I was really coming over here to wait for you."
A thousand years ago, in the Southwest, there was an Apache legend.
It told about a hidden canyon, guarded by the Apache gods and rich with gold.
As long as the Apaches kept the canyon a secret and never touched the gold...
...they would be strong, powerful.
That was the legend.
When the Spanish Conquistadores came, they searched for that canyon.
They called it "Cañón Del Oro," meaning Canyon of Gold.
But they never found it.
Three hundred years later, the Americans came.
They heard about the legend, but they called the canyon, "The Lost Adams."
That was because a man named Adams saw it once, or so he said.
But whether he did or not, he never saw anythin' again...
...because the Apaches burned out his eyes.
Everybody knew about that legend and a lot of people believed it.
Cañón Del Oro. The Lost Adams.
And then for a while there, back in 1874, they called it, "Mackenna's Gold."
Take it easy, old man.
You're not healthy enough to play games.
I know you. You are Mackenna.
-The marshal.
-That's right, but I don't know you.
Why'd you try to bushwhack me?
Somebody pay you?
-Colorado?
-No pay. Nobody pay.
-Well, then, why?
-Because you look for gold.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, an old man like you...
...going around shooting at prospectors.
Keep that up, you're gonna get in trouble.
Besides, if you know me, you know
I quit gold huntin' a long time ago.
The only dust I ever found was prairie dust.
Never got rich but I sure got thirsty.
But now you look for the gold again.
-Everybody look for the gold.
-What gold?
What gold?
I know this place. That's Shaking Rock.
No gold around there.
I've been there.
Why you stay with me?
Why you not kill me?
Well, that's what I oughta do.
Tell you what, you give me your word you won't go around...
...pickin' off people anymore, and I'll take you home.
No home.
Well, I'll get you to a doctor, anyway.
I die here.
Now you have the gold.
But you will wish you never see this map.
The spirits will kill you. No laugh.
It is a secret place.
So that's what it's supposed to be.
Cañón Del Oro, The Lost Adams.
Don't worry, old man,
I won't go looking for it.
Wasted three good years chasing that wild goose. There is no Lost Adams.
It is bad time.
Young warriors want gold...
...like white men.
It is good time for old man to die.
Plenty of time for that, old man.
Don't rush it.
Feel like eating something?
Old man?
Old man.
I wish you hadn't shot at me.
I thought maybe you were someone else.
Soldiers. Many soldiers.
Sir, you have been most kind and we are grateful.
We ask no more of your hospitality than the loan of a few horses and mules...
...which we need, and some food for our journey.
Also, we will take your wife...
...because if we run into trouble with the Cavalry she may come in useful.
If we pass this way again, God willing,
I will sell her back to you.
That is a true promise.
Take a rest, Marshal.
We will finish the old man's grave.
We'll make it a little longer, a little wider...
...and then maybe we will bury you together.
God is good to me.
You remember?
I told you I would come for you, old friend.
You'll never get back, old friend.
I will find a way.
Put that shovel down and come and talk to Colorado.
Don't move, Mackenna, or I'll cut you in half.
Now come out like a gentlemen.
You know, we've been trailing that old man for two weeks now.
-Where's the map?
-Map? What map?
I know this fellow.
He's a good card player.
He always remembers the cards.
If he saw the map, he remembers it.
So we have a map in his head.
I told you.
I told you nobody runs me out.
And now I have you, and you will take us to the gold.
And then I will kill you.
Hurry up, Besh.
Cover him with some rocks and let's go.
No. He is a chief.
He was going to Cañón Del Oro.
We bury him there.
Are you crazy?
You know how bad he's going to stink by the time we get there?
Of course. He's a chief.
He must be buried there.
I should have thought of it myself.
Besh, come on.
In the old days, before Mackenna ran him out of the territory...
...Colorado had a hideout in a little box canyon.
Now that he was back, he was using it again.
And that's where he took Mackenna, his living map.
You're crazy to come back.
You know Judge Bergerman put a price on your head.
You know, that's funny. I never lay eyes on that Judge Bergerman.
But he don't like me.
Well, someday me and him will meet.
And I will take his head, in a basket.
Anyway, I came back after that map you burned up.
Why? You can buy a dozen just like it for a dollar a piece.
Not like that map. Not like the map old Prairie Dog was carrying.
Well, that old man wasn't Prairie Dog.
Prairie Dog is dead.
He sure is now.
The whole thing is a fairy tale.
There's no Cañón Del Oro.
Old Adams was never there.
Then why did you kill
Prairie Dog and take his map?
-That's not the way it happened.
-I know how it happened.
You just got tired of working for $20 a month...
...so you took advantage of that poor old man.
You bushwhacked him, gunned him down, and took his map.
I'm surprised at you. A marshal.
-Hesh-ke remembers you.
-I remember her, too.
Hesh-ke.
What I can't figure out is how you knew about this map. It's the only real one.
It was supposed to be only in Prairie Dog's head.
He was supposed to pass it on before he died.
Then somebody found out there really was a map.
And two weeks ago, the old man up and left the tribe.
Well, why didn't he pass it on?
I guess he didn't know who he could trust.
See, the Apache have changed.
They're beginning to think like white men now.
Some of the young think they got more use for that gold than those old spirits.
There isn't any gold.
And if there was, it would belong to the whole tribe.
You're wrong.
That gold belongs to the spirits, and they said I can have it.
Listen, old friend, I know you.
You're just like an Apache: Very stubborn.
These other friends of mine here, they are stubborn, too.
Why don't you just take us there and we'll be partners?
-There's enough for all of us.
-I've been there.
There's not enough gold there to fill your back tooth.
-You've been in the canyon?
-There's no canyon.
You don't know.
Listen, you like to gamble.
Let's take a chance.
Suppose we lose?
Well, then we split up and you go wherever you want.
How? On foot with my hands tied behind my back?
No. I'll give you anything you need.
Water, horses, your guns.
-When?
-When what?
The guns?
When you take us there.
I mean, you gotta prove yourself, no?
I'll tell you what else I'll give you.
I will give you the girl.
-What girl?
-The one you've been looking at.
I tell you the truth. Her husband's rich.
-You will get a big reward.
-No!
Monkey, what do we want?
We want the gold. Why?
Because when we get the gold, we can buy all the women we want.
Besides, if Laguna don't show up tomorrow, it's an extra share for all of us.
No.
You want the Scar-face? Take her.
Take the little fat one.
Take the old woman.
You can have lots of fun.
What do you say, we shake on it?
All right.
I'll take you there.
And the gold is all yours.
I'll take you there and then I go, like you said.
No gold?
Why?
You like Hadleyberg so much?
They don't like you. That's what I hear.
I'll tell you the truth. I'm superstitious.
I don't want to tangle with those Indian spirits.
-Okay. You're crazy, but okay.
-And another thing.
You tell your little boy there
I want all my stuff back.
Sure. I keep everything safe for you until you go.
But there's no gold and there's no canyon.
I make the jokes, compadre.
Hesh-ke.
You're lucky.
Looks like she ain't holding no grudge.
She was mad. I think she still likes you.
Too bad I already gave her to Monkey.
You want to change your mind?
Sleep well, old friend.
Miss.
You know me. I'm Mackenna, the marshal.
I'm not going to hurt you.
You know me.
It was your father who made me marshal.
They killed my father.
They killed my father.
Don't tell any of them, nobody, that you're Judge Bergerman's daughter.
If Colorado finds that out, you'll be in worse trouble than you are now.
You understand?
You hear me?
Yes, I remember you.
You came out to the ranch once for supper.
That's right. I was once.
They say you like to play cards.
Well, yes, I enjoy an unfriendly game of poker from time to time.
Off-duty, of course.
I take a drink now and then, too.
My father didn't hold with gambling and neither do I.
Well, I know, Miss. I know that.
I'm trying to mend my ways. Seriously.
It doesn't look right for a marshal to be playing cards. I know that.
Now you rest.
Try to sleep.
And remember what I told you.
We start early tomorrow.
Go get some sleep.
You see, I keep my end of the deal, old friend. You keep yours.
Better put your belt on.
You could lose your pants.
-Okay, come on.
-Ain't we gonna wait for Laguna?
Naw. He likes that girl in Hadleyberg so much, let him get rich with her.
Man comes with flag.
Hesh-ke, take the girl inside.
I don't think they're looking for you,
Marshal.
But if they are, I would like to kill you.
I don't know how I'd get you to that canyon if you did.
You could with a broken kneecap.
Painful, but possible.
If you want to collect the reward on that girl, remember that Hesh-ke has a knife.
Colorado!
John Colorado!
Ben!
Ben Baker! Ben!
-My old friend!
-No!
Stay where you are, Colorado.
Who's that with you?
Why, Marshal. You and Colorado together.
Well, well, well.
-Surprised?
-No.
Some of the people with me might be, but not me.
Not with a stake like this one.
No, this is no time for holding old grudges.
Speaking for myself, I'm glad you're here.
We can play some poker.
Not with your cards.
Welcome back, Colorado.
And there's enough for all of us.
-Enough?
-We know all about it.
We know you've been looking for Prairie Dog.
We know you got the word from Besh and Little Hatchet here.
How? And how'd you know we were here?
Nobody but us knows about this place.
Laguna.
Sorry, Colorado.
You know me.
-I drink too much, then I talk too much.
-Yeah.
Then they had me.
You see, didn't I say
Laguna shouldn't go into Hadleyberg?
Colorado, it's a big desert.
It's going to take a lot of eyes to find that old man.
And after that, it's going to be a long way to the canyon.
There's cavalry out after you.
More than you've ever seen.
And a lot of bronco Apaches on the prowl, after anybody and everybody.
Probably after the gold, too.
You don't know what's going on out there.
You need us.
One more thing.
You got yourself a mighty fine place here, but it's a box canyon.
One way in, same way out.
We could camp outside until you get awful hungry.
Well, there's a lot in what you say.
Of course, if the soldiers catch us together, you will hang together with me.
If Mackenna's gonna take a chance with you...
...that's good enough for me.
Well, what do you think, Mackenna?
I'm glad he's here.
Like he says, we can play some poker along the way.
Besh, with respect, move the chief.
It is true that there's enough for all of us.
But it is also true that it's a long way to the canyon.
It's a deal.
Come up and have some breakfast.
Hold it!
He double-crossed me.
You all knew I'd kill him the first chance I got.
Anyway, there's enough for all of us, only now there'll be a little bit more.
Okay.
Only no more killing, or there sure will be a lot of it.
You know, Ben, we've got a deal, but...
...I wish I could have seen all your friends before we made it.
What's wrong with them?
These two, I don't know what they are.
And I'm afraid to guess.
We were just passing through Hadleyberg...
...and I'm afraid we overheard a most interesting conversation.
Mr. Baker was kind enough to allow us to join the group.
He promised this to be good sport.
And profitable, too.
Is that so?
Is that so?
Colorado.
Yeah. "Good sport."
I know this fellow.
You're the storekeeper from Hadleyberg.
Does your wife know where you are?
I don't know this one, but he looks pale, too.
What are you? A dentist?
No. He's the editor of the Hadleyberg Gazette.
-This one looks like a preacher.
-I preach.
-Yeah? What you preach, gold?
-The Word of God.
Yeah, but you like gold, right?
It can work for the Lord as well as the devil.
Why should only the Church of Rome have gold?
Gold, silver, idols and corruption.
When I get my gold...
-Your gold?
-...my share.
My share will build a tabernacle to the Lord.
A temple of the true Gospel, a whole string of 'em through the territory.
Ben, to bring this fella, you gotta be crazier than he is.
I told you, everybody knows.
You can't keep gold a secret.
It travels in the air.
Anyway, we can use every gun we can get, no matter who carries it.
Mackenna.
Preacher, this isn't going to be like a walk to church on Sunday.
You might get yourself killed.
Might have to do some killing yourself.
The Lord knows what he wants his servants to do.
Anyway, that gold belongs to the Apache.
It can be used for them, to bring 'em to the Lord.
Ay, Chihuahua!
He makes a good deal with his Lord.
Now we come to the last and the best.
A blind man and a kid.
I see good enough for both of us.
That old man has a better right to be here than we have.
Don't you know him?
That's Adams himself.
Adams?
That's Adams.
-You see? That's Adams.
-I see Adams.
-I don't see any gold.
-There's gold there.
More gold than you ever saw.
All the gold in the world.
Yeah, tell him. Tell him the story.
No. It's been told too many times.
But we're gonna take you back there.
Go on, Mr. Adams.
-Tell us.
-No.
Well, it was the Mexican that took us there...
...the one who was brought up by the Apaches.
He didn't want no gold for himself.
He was afraid.
Kept talking about the old Apache spirits.
All he wanted was a string of horses.
So we gave it to him.
The way he took us there...
...twisting and turning, and mostly by night.
We never knew where we were.
And at the last, he made us put on blindfolds.
When we took 'em off...
...there it was...
...the prettiest little valley you ever saw.
Sparkling and shining in the sun.
It was just like a dream.
Indians used to live there 1,000 years ago, maybe even more.
And gold everywhere!
The canyon wall had streaks...
...five yards, ten yards wide.
On the canyon floor, there were nuggets laying all over the ground. Pure gold.
Gold dust in every clump of brush.
You couldn't put a pan in the river without showing colour.
Well, the first day we filled a great big coffee pot with just nuggets.
No one could lift it.
Well, we built a shack.
Went to work.
Next thing, the Apaches were there.
They killed everyone, except me.
Then they fixed my eyes, and left me in the desert.
I wasn't any older than this lad here.
Tell 'em about the nugget.
Well, when I got found...
...I still had one little nugget in my pocket. Just a little one.
$190 it was worth.
Just a little one.
You know something? You're pretty.
I don't know if you are a boy or a girl.
If you are a boy,
I'm going to give you a haircut.
If you are a girl, I am going to kiss you.
I think you are a girl.
That's Hachita.
Soldiers!
Now who's going to do it, your men or mine?
-Yours. You have more to spare.
-We'll cut for it.
Okay. But I shuffle.
When we move out...
...you gentlemen head straight for the Cavalry.
Tell them about Colorado.
You tell 'em I'm his prisoner.
What? I don't understand.
How could you be his prisoner?
-You trying to get rid of us?
-I'm trying to save your lives.
Forget about the gold, Mr. Weaver, there isn't any.
-Get back to your store.
-I don't believe you. You're lying!
You know better. Get out.
A man like you has no business here.
There's good use for gold.
Do a lot for the territory.
-Forget about it. Do what I tell you.
-No.
These men have gold fever.
Get out of this. Get to the Cavalry.
Mackenna.
-What is he telling you?
-The truth. I told them to go home.
Why are you so selfish?
You can't keep it all for yourself.
Did he tell you that he killed Prairie Dog?
He burned the map, but he knows where the canyon is.
-That's the truth.
-Well, now, that's more like it.
I never trusted you, Mackenna.
I knew it was a mistake to let the judge talk us into making you a marshal.
A man from nowhere. A drifter.
You never were one of us.
-I cleaned up your town.
-Where's your badge now?
Marshal, did you really kill that old man?
Sure, but it was self-defence.
You're a murderer!
It's been a nice, quick trial.
When's the hanging?
What's all this talk of hanging?
We're all friends here. All partners.
Inga! What are you doing here?
Why is she here?
I will tell you.
I will tell you the whole truth.
On our way to meet Mackenna, when he sent for us...
...we ran out of food, so we stopped at a little ranch.
We expected to pay, but the man...
...he starts to shoot.
So we beg, "Please, stop!"
He's crazy. He won't listen.
So we thought the best thing to do, make her a partner, give her a full share.
Your father's dead?
But what can we do now? Nothing.
We'll never get another chance like this.
-You mean it was an accident?
-I swear it.
I, myself, said a prayer over his grave.
Well, we can't bring him back now, that's for sure. Right, Fuller?
No, we can't.
Right, storekeeper?
I don't know. I don't know what to think.
This isn't what I expected.
I didn't think it would be like this.
I don't know what to do.
You can get out of this, all of you, before it's too late.
Gentlemen, forgive me, I'm a stranger here so I haven't followed a good deal of this...
...but I do feel it would be a terrible pity if we fell out among ourselves...
...or if we abandoned what we all set out to accomplish.
I mean, we're embarked on a great adventure, gentlemen.
Something that comes only once in a lifetime.
So, I propose that we forget the past, whatever may have occurred...
...and all go forward.
He's right!
Why else do you think the good God brings us all together like this?
It's true, Padrecito?
I have nothing to say to you.
The Lord has his own ways and I have my own reasons for being here.
So we agree,
Mackenna takes us to the canyon.
Sure, we agree.
We all agree to get rich.
We're all going to be millionaires.
Every one of you.
That's what you think, and nothing else matters.
The best man your town had has been murdered.
And all you can say is,
"Well, we can't bring him back."
Not much of an epitaph, is it?
It's all you've got time for.
You can't see, you can't hear, you don't want to know anything but that gold.
You're sick with it, all of you.
I started out being his prisoner and now I've got you all on my back.
There's no gold, no canyon.
There's nothing.
It's just a story that this old man tells to get himself free drinks.
I'll take you there. I got no choice.
But I'll tell you this, not many of you will be coming back.
There is gold.
I saw it. All the gold in the world.
Come on. We're wasting time.
You know, I'm beginning not to trust you.
I trust you.
My God, after all these years, don't you know you mount a horse on the left side?
They figured they had only one chance of gettin' past the Cavalry...
...and they had a plan.
They'd gotten the squaw so drunk she couldn't talk.
And two of Baker's men were gonna ride her right into the camp...
...making out they were being chased by Apaches.
And while Hachita, Besh, and Monkey were carryin' on...
...as though they were a whole raidin' party...
...all the rest were gonna take off a different way.
If it all went well, they'd meet up later.
That was the plan.
And with a little bit of luck, it just could work.
What's going on?
I can't tell, sir.
Don't shoot!
It's a squaw.
Tied to the horse!
Easy. Easy.
Where's the sergeant?
Get out of the way.
All right, let go.
What the hell's going on here, Sergeant?
Pie-eyed, sir.
I'll get some black coffee into her.
Maybe we'll make some sense out of this.
All right, the party's over.
Get back to your posts, all of you.
Do you hear me? Move!
So now they were all together.
The good citizens and the outlaws...
...and Mackenna and the girl.
They made for the waterhole at the old Brogan ranch...
...because it was the last chance to fill up before they hit the desert.
The Apaches had burnt out the old
Brogan place about five years before.
Nobody ever took it over because it was too far out.
But everybody knew about the waterhole, and everybody used it.
It was kind of neutral territory.
It's the Cavalry!
We're surrounded. It's the Cavalry!
I'm Judge Fuller!
You're making a mistake.
I'm Judge Fuller!
I'm editor of the Gazette!
I've captured Colorado!
Don't shoot! I've captured Colorado!
Don't shoot!
I've got old man Adams here.
Don't shoot, please!
Riding in this country without a gun?
Very reckless.
I knew we could depend on you.
Miss?
Leave her alone.
I mean leave her.
No. We're back to the way things were.
You gave her to me, don't you remember?
We're short of water and she's slowing us up.
So leave her.
-Get out of the way.
-No.
I'm not much good to you dead.
Has it crossed your mind that you'll never see that canyon if you kill me?
I won't kill you, but I'll hurt you awful bad.
So get out of the way.
There's plenty of water.
Less than two hours from here.
Are you crazy?
Just keep your eye on the dealer.
You're good.
You're really good.
-For this I give you Monkey's share.
-Yeah.
Come on, enjoy!
Mr. Mackenna, I want to thank you...
...for everything.
That's all right.
Your father and I never had much to say to each other...
...but he was a good man.
That's lucky for me.
Excuse me, but is there something between you and that Indian girl?
No.
There was a long time ago.
Then after I got the marshal's job,
I had to go out and collect her brother.
Then he got himself hanged.
Don't make her mad. She's kind of crazy.
Why aren't you married?
I guess I never found a man who could hold a candle to my father.
I guess not.
Hey, what's the matter with you?
You like to be dirty?
Show you a new way to get your clothes clean.
I'll never understand the gringo, never.
It's all your fault.
You know Hesh-ke.
You know she has a terrible temper.
I'm sorry. If Hesh-ke's got her mind made up to kill that girl, she'll do it.
You gave her to me and I don't want her damaged.
I can't watch her every minute.
What's the matter with you?
We've got enough partners now.
Besides, this will keep those Apache happy for awhile.
Some scout.
The man leading that Cavalry patrol was Sergeant Tibbs.
"Foxy" Tibbs his men called him.
He knew his way around.
Old "Foxy" Tibbs and his eight men just kept followin' on.
At the end of the first day, he sent two men back to the company...
...so they could show the lieutenant the trail.
And every day after, he kept sending two more men back, in kind of a relay.
And he hung on their heels, fast or slow.
Finally, it was five against five.
You two in the back, get going.
Good.
Now we can double back and take them one by one.
Yeah, that's good.
When they see us comin', they can turn around...
...and lead us right back into the arms of the whole company two by two.
Of course, they won't hang me.
Now I'll tell you what you can do.
Send the girl back to the troopers.
-Why?
-Well, for one thing, she holds us up.
They wouldn't be able to keep up with us if they had her on their hands.
No.
All right.
You've probably got a better idea.
No. I have no better idea.
-Only this one better work.
-It'll work.
-I'll tell her.
-Sure, you tell her.
-I can tell her.
-I know.
Miss.
You're free to go over there and join the soldiers. They'll get you home.
It wouldn't be fair to leave you here all alone.
He's not alone. He's got me.
I think I should stay, Mr. Mackenna.
Look, lady, you'd better go before I change my mind.
I'll come by for supper some night when I get back.
Now git!
Stay here. And keep your eyes open.
Well, that gets rid of her, anyway.
You've had a hard time, Miss Bergerman.
You have my sympathy.
Thank you. Sergeant, you will be able to do something about Mr. Mackenna?
Yes, I think I can.
Now there were only four of them left.
That made the odds a little better for Mackenna.
Only thing was Hesh-ke had ideas.
She wanted Mackenna back now.
And now the girl was gone, she figured there was nothin' to stop her.
Thanks.
Mackenna, don't make her mad.
Colorado, someone comes.
Stop! Now!
Take it easy. I'm coming in.
Take it slow.
Stay where you are.
I've come to join up.
I hope there won't be any trouble about it.
-You expect us to believe that?
-Don't!
He's a murderer.
He killed two men, his own men.
That's right.
That's right.
That means I have two extra horses.
Good horses. They'll come in real handy when we find the gold.
Oh, yes, the little lady here told me all about it.
Of course, I already had a pretty good idea from the squaw.
All right. But you're a foolish man.
Suppose we say okay now and sometime in the night we change our minds?
Tonight, tomorrow night, you got to sleep sometime.
I'll get my sleep.
There's no point in your killing me.
Not for one share, more or less.
-Besides, you need me.
-Oh, no.
We don't need you.
We've got enough trouble without you.
The Army'll be looking for you. They'd be more anxious to hang you than me.
No. They'll think you did it, or Apache, and I was taken prisoner.
During all this time that I've been chasing you around...
...l've thought it all out.
Yeah, you do need me.
You know how much gold weighs?
You especially, Mr. Mackenna.
How much is there? $1,000,000?
More? In raw gold.
There's not enough of us here to carry it out.
But with me, you've got a better chance of getting there and out alive.
You're right, Sergeant.
You're welcome, Sergeant.
Coffee for the sergeant.
Only don't forget, I'm the captain.
A sergeant who kills two of his own troopers.
-What do you think of that?
-Not a hell of a lot.
Now, be reasonable, Mackenna.
Oh, thank you.
After all, a man of my age and rank, there's no future for me in the Army.
Do you mind, Sergeant?
Why don't you stay with your new partners?
No hard feelings I hope, Miss Bergerman.
Easy, friend.
Mackenna's too precious to me.
Miss Bergerman?
Could it be that she's the little girl of my old friend, the judge?
Mackenna, we'll never be true friends if you keep secrets from me.
Let's go.
To get away from the Cavalry, they headed for the ferry on Yellow River.
They figured they could cross over on the raft there...
...and then double back on the trail later.
But what they didn't know was...
...that the Apaches had taken over the whole Yellow River territory.
And there was another thing they didn't know:
Some other Apaches had already burned down the ferry.
But they had been in a hurry, and the raft was still afloat.
They still had a chance.
Help me! The current's too strong!
Get out of here!
Damn Prairie Dog!
And don't you go saying we ought to take him with us.
All right, let's go.
Now they were there. They'd reached it.
They'd reached the place
Mackenna knew as Shaking Rock.
We're here.
Where's the canyon?
Tomorrow. At sunrise.
Who says?
The map says.
-You nervous?
-No. Just thinking.
Mackenna.
-So we'll get into that canyon tomorrow--
-Not we, Sergeant. I'm not going in.
Maybe.
You might change your mind.
And you know as well as I do...
...that Colorado's not going to share the gold with anybody.
You've had time to figure that out?
Enough. Now look, Mackenna, you and I, we ought to stick together.
The way you stuck to your two soldiers?
Well, this is where the map ends.
I expect you to keep your word.
Show me the canyon and I will.
Well, if it's anywhere around here, you'll see it tomorrow morning.
I want my guns. And I want the girl.
Tomorrow.
And if there's no gold,
I still get the guns and the girl.
There is gold.
You'll never know if you shove that thing any farther.
I'm not in the mood for jokes.
What'll you do with it? Your share, I mean.
That's my business.
Well, all right.
I know what you think.
One big drunk in every stinking saloon in Sonora, till it's all gone.
-Is that all you think I want?
-That's the way it's always been with you.
Sure, because there was never enough for what I really want.
But when I get the gold, they'll never see
Colorado around here again. Never.
Good. Where will you go?
Sorry.
Maybe I will tell you. But if you laugh...
I won't laugh.
A millionaire in Paris.
That's right.
What is it?
Well, for whatever it's worth, he says he's going to let us go tomorrow morning.
I don't know what's going to happen, but from the minute you wake up...
...you keep your eye on me.
However it goes, we're gonna have to move fast.
Do we have to?
Can't we see the gold first?
-There isn't any gold.
-But there was a map.
You saw it. It brought us here. You said we could see the canyon in the morning.
-I heard you.
-I said a lot of things to keep us alive.
I've been running the bluff of my life.
And tomorrow morning is the showdown.
But we've come so far.
And then not even to see it.
No, listen, my father wasn't rich.
After my mother died, I wasn't only his daughter, I was his ranch hand...
...because we couldn't afford to keep one.
But with my share,
I could buy a real ranch, a big one.
If I had your place,
I wouldn't be the marshal for five minutes.
You don't have to.
With your share, you can do anything you want to.
You like to gamble.
Build a gambling house.
-I'll be your partner.
-You're out of your mind.
Now, wake up! Your share, my share, there aren't going to be any shares.
I know him.
He doesn't share with anybody.
I'm sorry.
I must be crazy.
You've done so much for me. Everything.
And I'm nothing but trouble.
I don't know why you bother with me.
I have to. We're partners.
-Well, what happens?
-I never would have believed it.
I think you're gonna see that canyon in about a minute.
-My guns.
-No, not until I see the canyon.
All right. Look at the rock.
Watch that shadow.
-What makes this?
-I don't know.
Might be a quartz deposit.
Look!
Come on!
Up there!
Mackenna! Look! I'm covered in gold.
-Come on. We're getting out.
-Getting out? No, why?
Listen to me. If we don't get away, we're going to be killed.
We're not staying, not for all the gold in the world. So start climbing.
No. No bullets. I take them all.
-When?
-Last night.
The spirits tell me what to do.
This is Apache gold. They tell me...
...kill everyone today.
Even you, Colorado.
You are not Apache.
Don't look down.
Keep going! Climb!
Come on, keep going.
Come on. Just a little further.
You can do it.
Come on, try. A little bit more.
Come on.
Come on, climb.
Climb. Come on.
I can't.
Try!
Goodbye, old friend. No more jokes.
Mackenna!
Goodbye, Mackenna.
You know I'm coming after you.
Stay away from me, Mackenna.
Find a hole, old friend.
Make it deep.

There's only one thing worse than a crook, that's a clumsy crook.
Keep the money, just give me my horse.
- You'll get your horse and a rope.
- No, hey... !
- Who was shooting?
- It turned into a hanging party.
- Hanging who?
- The new man, for cheating.
You kick a cheat out of town, not lynch him.
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, George.
Wake up and get out here.
Lay still, boy. Come on.
Get him up to his room. Let me know if he needs anything, except brains.
How come you didn't hear when they dumped me there?
I sleep pretty good sometimes.
No questions about last night?
I knew what was gonna happen, and it did.
They weren't just five men, they were a mob. I tried to stop them.
I believe you.
When a gambler lets his game wind up in a killing, pretty soon he don't have a game.
You know anything about this?
What about you?
Was there a game downstairs after I closed up last night?
Maybe you're right at that.
But I don't know, I can't swear to it.
You know, I always wanted to bust into that glass to find out what your hole card was.
What do you think it was?
Ace of diamond.
I think you had your royal flush.
So did the other man.
But he folded, so he never found out.
- Where you heading?
- Anywhere, to leave this place behind.
But first I got to deliver a message.
- Finish packing for me?
- All right.
- Morning, Mr Evers.
- Hello, Van.
Stoney, Mace. How are you feeling?
- Never better.
- Same. How are you?
I'd say come and visit me, but I know better.
- My daughter's in, go on up.
- Thank you.
What are you doing out in the sun?
You sleep all day.
- I had to get up early to pack.
- Pack?
You're always coming or going.
When will you decide to stay?
People who stay have no place to go.
Where's your brother?
If you're going to say goodbye again, say it.
- Goodbye.
- Say it properly.
All right... There.
That was one wore-out, no-account kiss.
How was that?
Fine, but you wasted it.
I don't plan to come back this time.
It wasn't wasted.
You enjoyed it. And you'll be back.
Nora, you're the most foolish thing in the world, a good woman.
Why foolish?
She'll push herself up against a man till he forgets she's good.
- Then she expects marriage.
- How else would she end up?
With me she could end up picking hay from her dress.
Wanna bet?
Don't gamble on my better instincts.
I don't have any.
I just have instincts.
Nick!
Nick! Van wants to see you.
Here I am. How do I look?
From up here, just about right.
You two have been fighting each other for years.
What's your reason this time?
We don't need a reason.
I got one. I don't like him.
Do you think about that card player much?
Just all the time.
Big mistake, getting wound up with a gambler.
- You gamble right along with him.
- But not for a living.
What do you do for a living?
Sit around till you own the ranch?
Only half of it.
The other half will go to you.
Just giving you some brotherly advice.
You're not worried about me, just about yourself.
If Van was my husband, you couldn't run him. He'd run you.
No way.
I've had a gutful of that from Dad.
You could get along better with Dad if you tried. And with Van, and everybody.
Why don't they try to get along with me?
- Hello, Van.
- Marshal.
- Any news on the hanging?
- Nothing to hang anybody with.
- I don't even know his name.
- What do you do in a case like that?
You bury the man, but keep him in mind.
- You're off to Denver. Going for long?
- Depends on Denver.
- Everybody in for Denver!
- Why are you going?
In my business, you gotta follow the play. So long.
All right, Charley.
Pair of fives. Nine.
- Fives bet.
- I'll bet ten.
From what I read, you left Rincon too soon.
I don't know. That gold strike improves nothing to damn little.
You'll miss the easy pickings.
There's no easy pickings till they get it out of the ground.
There's no easy pickings in Denver, either.
Ma'am.
- Ma.
- Fred.
There's only one kind of people I don't like: strangers.
That's not a stranger, that's progress.
Sure. They tell me he's bringing in a long mahogany bar.
Real long. When the front end gets here, the rear end will still be in St Louis.
You stand to lose customers.
The ones I've been getting
I'd just as soon lose.
Whatever happens over there, my place stays the same: good liquor, a few card games and no girls.
- You might lose all your customers.
- Then to hell with them.
My name is Jonathan Rudd.
I come from God's House, just a little way up the street.
The House is ready for use, to hear God's word.
If He's only got one, I'll be there.
First services will begin on Sunday morning at 9 a.m.
You're all invited: the drunk, the sober, the big and little sinners, the clean and the unwashed.
The many who'll come to scoff and the few who'll come to pray.
You can count on me, Parson.
I'm the dirtiest, drunkest, most sinful fella the Lord ever saw.
There'll be a place for you.
There was a seat for Judas.
Ma'am.
- Deal.
- Who's Judas?
Let's get to gambling.
O, come, sinner, come there's room for thee
Hark, 'tis God's home
O, come and receive salvation free
Hark, 'tis God's home
O, come and rest, come and rest
Heavy-laden guilt oppressed
O, come and rest, come and rest
Hark, 'tis God's home
Amen
Well, I see
God's House is full today.
But I don't think I've started any religious revival.
You came here out of curiosity, most of you.
And your curiosity was mainly brought on by Mr Colt.
If I hadn't fired that gun, there'd be nobody here but me and the dog.
Before I came here, there was nobody but the dog.
You didn't seem to think you needed a church, just a big doghouse.
But I'm here to tell you, you need a praying place.
You want to know why? I'll tell you why.
Because you're hell-bent for hell.
The Lord saw fit to sprinkle gold here.
Man and his greed is turning Paradise into a pigsty.
By day he sweats for a pinch of yellow dust, and at night he squanders it on lust.
But let's not blame our sins on the gold.
There was sin here before it was found.
Just a while ago, a man was hanged, for no reason that ever came to light.
Nor were his murderers ever brought to book.
They walk the streets as free as you and l.
But their Maker knows who they are.
They can't escape from Him, and He will punish them.
Now I say to you, mend your ways.
Your feet are already on the downward path.
Stop!
Before the fires below devour you.
Amen.
May God bless you all.
You plan to be the conscience of this town?
- It could use one.
- Somebody elected you?
God.
And Mr Colt, first name Samuel.
Sort of biblical, isn't it?
Mr Colt votes a lot of people in.
- He also votes a lot of them out.
- You're forgetting about God.
Why not let God do his own work?
I'm filling in for him till he gets around to Rincon.
Well, if either of you needs any help...call on me.
Nick Evers.
Meet me here in an hour, Stoney, and space out those drinks.
Yes, ma'am.
- Nora.
- Mr Hurley.
The bridle broke going home from church.
- Dad patched it but I need a new one.
- I'll fix it in a jiffy.
Thanks. I'll be back after I finish my trading.
Mr Hurley... What did you think of the new preacher yesterday?
A lot more than he does of this town.
Maybe the man's right.
Fred Carson must be keeping banking hours.
But bankers don't leave the front doors open.
He must be in the storeroom.
I'll go see.
Stay out of there!
I'm going for help.
- What the hell is that?
- Looks like Stoney had an accident.
That's no accident.
He's been strangled.
George! Sit down.
That's right out of Rincon Creek.
Funny thing about gold, it doesn't look like gold until it gets to be money.
- Have you read about Rincon?
- Paper's full of it.
If it ain't the strike, it's Fred Carson being drowned in a flour barrel.
- Tomorrow it'll be Stoney Burough.
- What about Stoney Burough?
Somebody gave Stoney a new string tie.
Only it was made of barbed wire and a little tight.
That was some unhealthy card party I had going.
Three men dead.
- Up to now.
- Up to now?
It looks like someone's out to kill every man at that party.
That's a good reason to avoid Rincon, if you planned to come back.
That's what you've come a hundred miles to tell me?
- I'd have come further.
- Thanks.
But the night I got thrown out in the street, you never did wake up.
- I'm woke up now.
- Stay awake. When do we go back?
Back? It's you who ought to wake up.
If a man's out to kill you, don't let him pick the time.
You go to Rincon, he'll even pick the place.
I won't know him till he looks for me.
You won't know him in Rincon either, he won't wear a sign.
But I will, and then he might just make one bad move.
Well, I guess a man's gotta be a damn fool once in a while.
It proves he's still alive, huh?
I've seen strikes before. They eat a town up alive. Like a snake.
Before I go to Mama's, I'll clean up.
From what I hear, up the street there is the place for it.
Smash your baggage, mister?
- Can you find me a room?
- Mama figured you'd be back.
You still got your old room.
Van!
Take the bag up to the room, will you, George?
I heard about Fred. It wasn't easy, walking into that storeroom.
Walking out was the hard part.
And now Stoney Burough.
Everybody's edgy, even my father.
He's putting up a reward for Stoney's murderer.
Like he did for Fred Carson. He won't let me go anywhere by myself.
And look what he makes me carry.
Well it's a sure thing you won't kill anybody.
Unless you're that close.
I'm glad you're back.
Only you didn't learn much in Denver.
You forgot some.
- You need a shave.
- I was about to.
Not in her place!
I'd sooner shave you myself.
It happens I also need a bath.
I can't help you there.
- I'll post the notices.
- Thanks, Al.
- Hello, Van.
- Mr Evers.
What do you think of what they're doing?
What who's doing?
I just put up another $1 ,000 to find out, I don't know.
Tell Nick
I'll be at Mama Malone's tonight and to bring some good card players, he'll know who.
I'll do that.
- I thought this was a barber shop.
- What changed your mind?
You did.
Change it back.
It is a barber shop, and I own it.
I could use a shave.
If I got you for one bell, what do I get for two?
A barber.
Hazel, this gentleman wants a shave.
Yes, Miss Langford.
Ever give any shaves yourself?
- About once every thousand faces.
- I guess I'm the wrong number.
- Good afternoon, Miss Langford.
- Afternoon, girls.
"Miscellaneous" is $20.
What's "miscellaneous"?
Something you didn't ask for.
- Do many people ask for it?
- It sells well.
Thank you, sir.
We had a seven-man poker game that turned into a lynching party.
Now three are dead.
We're here to talk about those three and us four.
I care only about one of the four live ones, and that's me.
I care about the dead ones.
There never should've been a hanging.
Fred Carson was my friend, and
I could even stand Stoney Burough.
- Not you, though.
- You bleed too easy, Joe.
The hanged man was a cheat.
Stoney was a mean drunk.
Carson got paid for his hand when he weighed anything.
Anybody at this table could be doing these killings.
- You're not drunk, so you must be crazy.
- Shut up.
How did you figure that?
About the lynching, you could call it a partnership in a killing.
They all sit around and start itching, these partners.
- They wonder who'll crack first.
- Who would? It'd be his hide, too.
He'd swap his life for all the others.
If I thought anybody'd do that,
I'd kill him myself.
Sure, so would you, even you, that's what I'm talking about.
Van doesn't believe any of that.
He's just stirring things up, seeing what floats to the top.
I'd say Fred and Stoney got killed by an outsider who got even for this hanging.
- Got any proof of that?
- A little.
Do you know what I saw in Strangers' Corner in the cemetery?
Flowers on that card cheat's grave.
Who'd do that?
- Sure not me.
- Nobody but an outsider.
Take it that way, then.
But this outsider, this flower-picker, how did he find out Fred and Stoney were in the lynching party?
There's only one way he could find out. From someone who knew.
How'd he guess what outsider to go to?
Maybe he did a little figuring and tracking, like I did with the flowers.
Only better.
Maybe he even saw the man put flowers on the grave.
We're out to save our necks, and right now I wouldn't give two bits for the four of them.
All I know is,
I know less than when I got here.
Come on, Mace.
- I'm sorry you came back.
- I thought we were friends.
That's why I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
When I was younger, a shave lasted a lot longer.
Good evening, ma'am.
- This place is closed.
- Was closed.
You just opened it.
It's 2 a.m. and the girls have gone.
Not all of them.
You answer to one bell?
I'm not one of the girls, Mr Morgan.
You know my name.
We meet some place before?
No. I'd have remembered.
You're very gallant for 2 a.m. but I'm not one of the girls.
And I don't give shaves, especially at this hour.
How about that one face in a thousand?
The last man I liked is three years gone.
That's a long time.
Want to tell me about him?
What's there to say? He was a man.
Well, go on.
That covered it, Mr Morgan.
He was a man.
- How'd you know who I was?
- I inquired.
Why?
- I wanted to know who you were.
- Same question. Why?
- You're asking a lot of questions.
- I don't often hear the truth.
I'm still waiting for an answer.
Why did you find out who I was?
You're a man, which is no recommendation.
You're a gambler, which is less.
You think you're the best gambler in the world.
And that's no recommendation at all.
But like you said, three years is a long time, a very long time.
That's not good enough.
All right. I like you.
That's better.
Sometimes the truth is actions, not words.
Act!
That could've led to trouble in this town.
Prevented it.
If I was who you're worried about, it'd be too late. I'm Jonathan Rudd.
That's my church down the street.
Van Morgan.
Pretty late for a preacher, isn't it?
We don't keep hours.
Nor does Mr Poe, that's where I've been.
The liquor's better at Mama Malone's.
I believe you're right.
But I don't go for the liquor.
I go to get people away from it, on Sunday mornings at least.
Wind must've blown the door open.
Hey, you!
Gimme a hand, quick. Come on.
Hold him while I cut him down.
It's Mace.
- What do you want, Dad?
- I think I'll just have some coffee.
Thank you.
I think that's all I'll have, too.
I hate funerals.
Who'd want to kill Mace Jones?
Just about anybody who ever knew him.
What would it take to make you lose your appetite?
A bellyful.
Sometimes you don't seem quite human.
More like you were made in a factory or something.
If I was made by a machine then you made it and you ran it.
Stop it, both of you. Just once!
Now to the sin ofmurder we must add sacrilege.
Since coming to this town,
I've sadly had to perform the burial of three men who have died violently.
For the hand that slew
Fred Carson and Stoney Burough,
I sought the Lord's forgiveness.
But for the limitless evil of him who slew Mace Jones,
I ask for limitless punishment for he took a man's life in God's House.
Let us pray, therefore, that heaven receives the soul of Mace Jones, and that the soul of his killer wander the darkness for ever.
All men being sinful and Thou just,
I pray You regard any score against Mace Jones as even.
Strike it from Thy books and let him sleep. Amen.
Amen.
I didn't hear you praying,
Little George.
You never will, either.
I don't believe in it.
Hey, George.
Van called the last meeting,
I am calling this one, while we're still alive to meet.
We've paid for that hanging three times.
We've paid for it all right.
But anybody notice how?
Three times by some kind of strangling.
Stoney with wire, Fred smothered,
Mace got the rope.
All three of them strangled.
Which brings to mind what?
The way the card cheat died.
I still say it's the work of an outsider getting even for the card cheat and an insider telling him who did it.
I don't know why it didn't hit me before but it sure as hell hits me now.
We want the man, but we've never looked up from the card table.
Well, I am looking up now.
And right at me, huh?
If George was going to talk, he'd talk to the Marshal.
He'd talk where it'd do the most good, where we wouldn't find out.
Why?
What good would it do George?
You think George likes you, Joe?
He don't like nobody.
You're the one who found that man and told him about the card game.
Now you just tell us who he is.
I got no use for lynchers.
They ought to get the same thing they give out.
And if I needed any killing done,
I'd do it myself.
But you're right about one thing.
I don't cotton to most people.
Least of all to you.
Why, you... !
There's a right place to stop.
I don't know if Nick is right, but you'd best keep your back to the wall.
And Van had better sit right alongside him.
'Cause if I'm wrong about George,
I just might be right about him.
Everybody ought to have somebody to say goodbye. Even you, Mace.
That sermon over Mace, you take it hard that he died in your church.
My church?
I don't own it, I just look after it.
That night, how long were you out before the bell rang?
I told Marshal Dana.
Why don't you ask him?
I'd like to hear it from you.
I went up to Poe's, as I said.
I saw you on the way back.
I was gone maybe an hour.
Even if you talked some, that's a long time. Poe's is only 1 00 yards away.
Suppose I said I like to walk at night.
Suppose I said that's what I was doing.
You believe me?
No reason not to.
I'm glad you take my word for it, because that's what I was doing.
What kind of man murders in a church?
The kind that doesn't believe in God, the kind that God doesn't scare.
No killer is scared of God, Mr Rudd.
In a church, in an alley or behind a rock.
Watch this, sweetheart.
Left hand.
Men talk about guns like they're women.
"She's a beauty", they say.
What's beautiful about a gun?
If you were going to do a man in, what weapon would you use?
- It wouldn't be a gun.
- I'll bet it wouldn't.
If he was after us, we'd be dead.
"The wicked flee where no man pursueth."
"The righteous don't flee, they stand like a lion."
Yes, ma'am. That's the right quote.
Where'd you learn about the Bible?
Where'd a preacher learn how to shoot?
Every preacher was something else before he became a preacher.
You know, I'm tired of shooting at tin cans and bottles.
We still have some cartridges left.
We're not going to shoot each other, are we? How about...?
Six out of six.
Can't do better than that.
- You can only do worse.
- My shooting was way off.
- Way off? Six out of six?
- I was aiming at the spaces.
See you in church.
If every preacher was something else first, I wonder what he was.
Everybody was something else first, even me.
I don't know what you are now.
You don't need that gun to find out.
But maybe I need one.
Sam! I'll bank the fire. Go on home.
- Only one rig left? I'll take care of it.
- OK, Joe.
Are you still stewing about Mace Jones?
Stewing about how I sit down to a drink and play some cards, and how I get up and hang a man.
Being drunk is a poor excuse.
You weren't drinking very much, what's your excuse?
I don't lean on excuses.
Whiskey or no whiskey, you went along.
- With you leading.
- That makes you a sheep.
A drunk sheep maybe, but all the same.
- You were with us on that rope.
- Three men on that rope are dead.
You don't give a damn about anybody except yourself.
When I was ten, eleven...
...my mother died.
They laid her out in the parlour and my old man took me in to see her.
She wasn't my mother any more.
She was something busted.
She was something that wouldn't run any more.
My old man was crying...
...but not me.
He looked up and he said,
"Where's your heart, boy?"
I didn't say anything.
So he slapped me right across the mouth.
I still didn't say anything.
So...
...he took me out, back of the barn, and he beat the hell out of me.
But he never drew a tear.
I think your mother was as dead as you.
If I am dead...
...the same man killed me.
Name of Sig Evers.
Bring a glass for your friend.
I think he'll need it.
- He won't drink with you.
- Bring the glass.
Now it's reserved for just you and me.
That's right.
These are unlucky chairs.
Are you afraid to sit down?
You sure know where to find them.
Mace Jones in the church,
Joe Hurley in the stable.
Meaning that I could've killed both of them.
So could you. Trouble is, so could any other man in town.
Any one of those four guys could've blabbed to the killer.
My guess, though, is that it's the first, Fred Carson.
Why Carson?
Figure like the killer. First, you get the names of everybody.
Then you kill the guy who gave them to you.
You sure want him out of the way.
You're pretty good at that, figuring like the killer.
- Finish your drink.
- You have to start it to finish it.
That's what this meeting's about.
You're head of the Miners'
Association, so act like it.
Tell the Marshal to stop these killings.
- No miner has been hurt.
- Not so far.
It takes two hands to pan for gold, and you can't shoot with your teeth.
- We gotta have protection.
- All right.
- I'll see what I can do.
- All right.
- I'm doing what I can.
- We've had killings before.
But out in the open, and we could deal with them.
This don't make sense, and anyone can be next.
When we had two dead,
I put up $2,000.
Now we got four dead,
I'll put up $4,000.
A thousand a head, $4,000.
That's more than you make digging gold. I don't see anyone claiming it.
We're here to ask what you're doing about it.
I'm just a plain town marshal.
I'm not a Pinkerton detective.
I've got one deputy to help me out.
And Otis and me, we can't cover the ground.
You can put up $1 ,000 an hour, it won't give us more eyes and ears.
We need more tin stars, not rewards.
Any one of you can be sworn in.
If you find anyone else, send them in.
If you make everyone a deputy, you'll be swearing in the killer.
I don't want any star.
But I am serving notice.
I'm wearing my gun tied down, and if I have to, I am going to use it.
A man'd be a fool not to wear a gun and a bigger fool to use it too fast.
Someone who meant no harm could die reaching for a chew of tobacco.
You listen to Nick Evers and Rincon will have more dead than Gettysburg.
I'll tell you this:
I can't control the miners much longer, they're rounding up hotheads.
Either you do something or they will, and I can't say I blame them.
Nick says wear your gun and use it fast.
Mr Morgan says wear it and use it slow.
I say don't wear it and you won't use it at all.
- Do you wear a gun?
- Yes.
But I'll leave it at home if everyone else does, too.
And end up hanging by your bell-rope?
Well...
I could tell you to pray, but I don't believe the killer answers to prayer.
I'll remind you of another thing: all four dead men were wearing guns.
The guns didn't save them.
Can I ask you a question?
Why does a preacher put on a gun?
People get funny ideas about a preacher.
That when he starts pounding a Bible he stops being a man. That's not so.
But the Book doesn't say a man can't make himself better.
So I say, leave the guns at home.
Marshal.
I hate to go in there.
Just stay away from the flour barrels.
Are you still mad at me, Nick?
Not you, the world.
The world?
It's flat.
- Be with you quick as I can.
- Take your time, Mrs Wells.
This will make beautiful underwear.
The Chicago people say it's from Switzerland.
Seems a shame to cover it up.
It won't be covered up all the time, will it?
I mean, you gotta hang it on a line some time.
You're making this young lady blush.
Did the ribbons and elastic come?
I'll look in the storeroom,
I ain't unpacked everything yet.
- Why did you think I was blushing?
- At your age I did.
Someone like you, l...
- You belong in the storeroom.
- Why?
You were about to say women like me always wore black lace.
Yes. How else can men tell... who they're with?
They can tell long before they get to the underwear.
The last thing I expected was to like you.
Thanks. Women usually don't like women who like men.
Here it is.
I'll wrap it for you in a jiffy,
Miss Langford.
- I hope I'm not keeping you.
- No hurry, I'm getting an education.
Hey, mister.
- Say, aren't you Nick Evers?
- Yeah.
I hear you said every man should keep his gun handy.
- That's right.
- I agree. Handy means handy.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
What's been done, huh?
Not a damn thing.
- I say we put in a new marshal.
- Right.
If we don't do something, no one will.
- Looking for someone?
- Making sure nobody's looking for me.
Stop waving that around. Put it away.
Make this town safe and you can have it.
You're making it unsafe.
I'll take the gun.
Oh, no.
- What would you do if I gave it back?
- I'd load it right back up again.
- Try with that.
- That ain't gonna stop me.
- I'll get another one.
- You got another.
- Drop it or I'll throw you in jail.
- No.
- You heard me. Hand it over.
- No.
Stop it, you crazy fools.
Get down.
I don't care what side you're on, don't take it here.
All you can shoot off is your mouth.
I can't cover the side of the street from here.
Van, don't!
- They'll kill him.
- If you can't stand it, don't watch.
I'm glad you didn't listen to yourself and leave that home.
Sounds like the war is over, and without me, too.
Every player has his way of going.
Some raise, some call...
...some just pass.
I owe you something.
Say it and you got it.
Come to God's House every Sunday for a month.
That's a steep price for just my life.
- Miss Langford, meet...
- We've met.
At the window.
We were looking at the same goods.
She means you.
We were afraid you'd get shot.
- Looks like I could still get shot.
- Not by me.
I've been put out enough to do it.
You're both lying.
You could. But you couldn't.
He thinks he knows about women.
You don't, do you?
Oh, about one little thing, maybe.
How's Al?
He isn't cold, but he won't be warm for a while.
I'm going to move him to my place.
So now we've got a dead deputy and a shot-up marshal.
That ain't much law.
AI knows it all right.
He said for you to get help from Denver.
All right, I'll take the next stage out.
But we need some tin showing around here.
Is AI up to swearing in some deputies?
- He can do that, but not much more.
- Anyone want to volunteer?
We can't ask you, Mr Rudd, but Van, we could use your help.
I don't think so, a gambler with a star?
Some folks think no gambler is honest, they'd call it a stealing badge.
You know why they might say that?
Because men once gambled for the clothes of Christ.
Putting flowers on your brother's grave.
That's what finally gave you away to me.
Lucky the right man happened to see me.
It didn't just happen.
I made it happen.
I was looking for the man who was looking for me, you.
Somebody who'd talk.
You saved me a long hunt.
What were you doing in that street this afternoon?
You're not here to stop killing, but to kill.
I'm particular about who gets killed.
It would've been odd, you getting yours out there today.
All right, who's next?
George, bartender at Mama Malone's.
- He was in the card game?
- It was after hours, why not?
- He was in the hanging party?
- Right up front.
Bartender George, that makes five.
You make six, my brother makes seven.
How many more were in that game?
- Just one.
- And when do I get that name?
- After you settle with George.
- I see.
One at a time all the way, that's it?
That's it.
This name you're keeping back.
Why save him for last?
He led the hanging.
When I tried to stop him, he used a gun butt on me.
He's last because I want him to die once for every man in that game, and once for himself.
Besides, he'll be the toughest to take out.
Wouldn't like you hurt before your job is done.
I killed those men because they killed my brother.
What about you?
Why did you want them dead?
Because they were alive and I didn't want to be dead.
Any one of them could've found you.
They could be doing to me what I'm doing to them.
I see. "Do unto others."
I've got just one rule: me first, nobody second.
Name me somebody who don't feel that way.
You had to do it, if you're to keep up with Poe.
They say competition's the life of trade. It'll be the death of me.
Don't complain, it's closing time and we're still full.
You'd better turn in so you can clean up this mess in the morning.
That is if you can sleep for the racket.
I was born in a bass drum and raised in a brass horn.
George!
Get up! Get out here and clean up this sinkhole!
Oh, my God!
Pete, get someone from the Marshal's office, quick.
- What for?
- Just get him. George's room.
Stand you for a cup of coffee.
- What's the matter?
- It's George.
I found him dead when
I opened up this morning.
- Pete, will you get Dr Cooper?
- Yes, sir.
Somebody shot a hole right through George's gut.
Must've been from close up.
There's powder burns on his vest.
What bastard would do a thing like that?
He was a mean one.
Who'd shoot a man that was begging for his life?
He was no beggar. He wouldn't have said "please" to live 1 ,000 years.
It sure looks like he's begging, with his hands like that.
Or maybe praying, which comes to the same.
Praying?
Not George.
The man they dug that one for ought to be buried over there.
- In Strangers' Corner.
- George was no stranger to you.
- He sure was a strange colour.
- We all look alike to the worms.
I took you for a fool.
I made a mistake.
Big mistake. Forty-five calibre.
There had to be trouble before I got the last name.
Sure, once you got it, you'd kill me before you killed him.
- So instead you're going to kill me.
- It's bite or get bit, Reverend.
And I'm biting.
There's one thing you forgot.
Who'll take care of the last man?
- Van Morgan will be my pleasure.
- Van Morgan.
I've had to believe you. But I don't believe you tried to stop that hanging.
Stop it? Hell, I led it, just like I've been leading you.
Any last wish?
Would you like a smoke?
Would you like to say a prayer?
I would like to pray.
Not for myself, for my brother.
Go ahead.
If you can find one to fit that card cheat.
Oh...but first, get rid of the gun.
Unknown, found hanged March 1 , 1 880.
It said that in the papers, too.
Did you know that?
Get praying.
This man was lynched in Rincon,
Colorado, that's what it said.
- Then it said what he looked like.
- He looked like every second man.
Height, weight, colour of eyes, hair.
That's not what brought me here, though.
Marshall Dana wrote something else.
Old knife scar, right shoulder.
That made it Frankie Red.
Well, Frankie. I guess they didn't bury you with any gospel.
I'll try to make it up to you now.
This might be good for you, too.
Oh, come on,
Frankie's waiting for you in hell.
I just had a thought.
When they find you, my old man will offer another thousand.
Only this time it'll be for me.
- Here it is.
- Come on.
Something for you...from the Book.
"'Vengeance is mine,' sayeth the Lord."
But this day I am the Lord, and I repay.
I sure wouldn't want your job.
I heard about George, Van. I'm sorry.
But we've got two US marshals coming in a week. Anything else happen?
I've got some real bad news for you, Mr Evers. The worst.
But I don't like to tell you on a street corner.
I think you just told me, it's...
- It's Nick, isn't it?
- He was shot.
- Nick's dead?
- Yes, honey.
- Where is he?
- Over at Doc's house.
Come on, honey.
I talked to Mr Evers before he went home.
He'd like you at his son's funeral.
- I'll see him at the graveyard.
- The burial's gonna be at the ranch.
I'm taking the casket out there now, the family asked me to.
If you'd like to ride along with me, you're welcome.
I'll go by myself later on.
Catch up with you, maybe.
One for you, Nick.
Stoney.
Tinhorn.
Carson, Mace, Hurley.
And me.
I hope you win.
Can't miss.
I'm playing with six dead men.
Where are you going?
For a horseback ride.
Wanna do me a favour, Mama?
Depends.
If I'm not back by dark, will you flip that last chair up?
- What if you do get back?
- We'll sit down and play some cards.
About time. If a man don't work, he ain't respectable.
- Mr Rudd.
- Mr Morgan.
Last time I came to the Evers ranch,
I thought Nick was a lucky man.
"For every beast of the forest is mine."
You've preached a lot of funerals lately. Got anything new?
The funeral's for the living.
I'll say that he was a good son and brother, a loyal friend and a good citizen.
- Won't you gag on all that?
- Why should l?
I'm a gambler, and I don't always bank on my cards or I'd be broke.
Like your opponents.
Every once in a while, something comes out of the air, and says something in your ear.
- An hour ago it landed.
- What did it say?
It said, "This is it, play it."
Well, then, play it.
You're the killer of Nick Evers and all the rest.
Make that executioner, of the criminals who killed my brother.
They hanged him for just some fast work with some cards.
George wasn't in the game.
Nick Evers swore he held that rope and so did you.
George wasn't there, and neither was l.
So Nick was the one who talked.
Looking back, he was due to go bad.
I thought he was too smart to get killed.
Nobody's too smart for that, not even you.
And not even you, Mr Rudd.
You left George for dead, but he lived to say something with his hands.
It didn't come to me till you turned that last chair over at the card table.
George wasn't praying, he wasn't begging.
He was trying to show who killed him, a man who prayed.
You won't be reading over Nick
'cause I'm taking you in.
There'll be no trouble,
Mr Morgan. But...
...if you don't mind, first I'd like to read the rest of that psalm...
...about the thousand hills.
Well, read.
Or can't you read upside down?
If that's a Bible, read it.
If not, drop it.
Mr Rudd's the man we've been looking for, Mr Evers, the killer.
Of Nick, too? But why?
I don't know about the others, but
I think Nick got onto him like I did.
I won't see your father again, so would you say "so long" for me?
I will, Van. But I don't think he'll ever get over Nick.
- You'd better, though.
- I'll try.
But it's not like a bullet.
A bullet kills you or you heal up.
- It's the first time you didn't say it.
- Say what?
That I'd be back.
That's right. Do you know why?
'Cause you don't give a damn any more.
I do. But this is the first time
I haven't been sure you'll be back.
Cards, dice and anything else, you're never sure of it.
One thing is:
I give a damn about you.
A big damn.
Strange about Rudd.
He could've kept this place going.
So what was he before he was a preacher?
Maybe he always was a preacher.
Lily, I'll see you in Denver in about a week, you know where.
If I'm not coming,
I'll send you a four-flush.
Why must you be the first to say goodbye?
I don't know if this is goodbye.
I'm used to the truth from you, a yes or a no.
This time the truth is maybe.
Give me a kiss.
That'll last me a week.
- What if you don't show up?
- That'll mean the kiss wore off.
If you're not made of iron,
I'll see you in Denver.
You sure didn't feel like iron.
Come on, hurry. Let's go.
Come, come on. Come on.
You are not leaving.
Why won't you understand that I have to go where my husband goes?
I suppose that even if he jumped off a cliff you'd have to follow him.
Yes.
You see, I love him very much.
Love. How much good will your love do you...
...in the middle of a wilderness surrounded by Indians?
What kind of a frontier woman do you think you'll make?
You've never had to cook or wash or keep house in your life.
Your father and I saw to that.
I can learn, Mother.
- And that husband of yours.
- Mother.
Yancey Cravat. That isn't even a name.
It is my name now.
What is a lawyer going to do on a homestead?
If only you'd let me say something.
If Yancey says he can do it, he can.
I warned you when you married him, a man you had only known three months...
...that you'd live to regret it.
I will never regret it. Not for one second.
There's never been anything like it in the history of the world.
Imagine, a whole territory settled in one afternoon.
Whole cities springing up in one hour.
I'll bet you there's thousands of people on that borderline right now...
...today, right this moment, steaming and waiting for that opening gun next week.
Now, can you imagine it?
Can you just imagine it?
Look. Here.
Here is the Oklahoma territory...
...over 2 million acres of the finest land the crow ever flew over.
And here, see...
...that's all divided up into quarter sections.
Like that. That's... Um...
Now.
Here are the soldiers all lined up in a row.
Here they are all lined up...
...to see that nobody gets into that territory before they're supposed to.
Now, now here...
Here come the settlers.
Here they come, thousands of them.
Thousands of them, from all over.
And here. Here you are, honey.
Here they come.
And they're just so anxious.
They're just starving for a piece of that land.
They're starving for it.
Matter of fact, they'd fight for it.
They'd even die for it.
Well, how about that?
Charley, hand me a few more of those settlers, will you?
That's a boy.
And give some to the children too, huh?
Oh, Sabra.
Oh, my Sabra.
Here. Have yourself a settler, huh?
Mr. Yancey!
Better not forget this, Mr. Yancey.
You might need it one day.
Yeah.
- Goodbye, Father.
- Goodbye, my dear.
I envy you.
All right.
Now, remember what I told you, dear.
A little tighter.
Both reins.
That's right.
And I'll follow you.
You all ready?
- Yes.
Good luck, darling.
Mother. Goodbye.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Yancey, it's getting awfully lonesome back here.
Well, we'll be stopping right up here ahead, honey.
That's very pretty.
Where did you learn that?
In the old country.
What does it mean?
"If God keeps me alive, believe you me...
...I will take care of no one but thee. "
Darling, how many times you walked towards me...
...I looked at you, wanted you?
How many times you didn't even look at me?
And I wanted you.
- Yes, sir, she sure looks good from here.
- Ha-ha-ha.
What are you laughing at?
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Let's start sailing.
What do you want with me?
- Wants to know what we want.
- What do we want?
Anybody who wears anything...
- Oh, look at this. Look at this.
- ... as pretty as that ain't no pea patch.
Get up.
I ought to shoot your ears off, scaring my wife like that.
Cim. Hey, what's the matter with you?
Don't you recognize me? The Kid?
I recognized you.
Oh, Cim, how was we supposed to know it was your wife?
Somebody else's wife, everything would've been all right.
I'm sorry. We didn't mean anything.
Well, I guess there's no harm done.
- How are you, boy?
- Just great.
- Who's this?
- It's Wes.
- I'm Pat Jennings' boy.
- Jennings.
- Remember Hoss?
- Yeah, don't tell me.
- This is what's-his-name, uh... Barry.
- Barry.
Ned Barry's boy, yeah.
Say, last time I saw this fellow, he was just about so high.
We heard you got killed in a gunfight out in California, remember?
I used to work for this boy's daddy as a ranch hand.
How nice.
What are you boys doing?
Devilmenting around?
We're kind of riding around.
I used to ride the old bag line myself...
...living off the old hospitality of the South as it were.
Well, you had your breakfast?
- No, we ain't ate yet.
- Fine.
Honey, you better lay out a little more food and cups and saucers and all.
We're gonna have some guests for breakfast.
Just turn around and step over there...
...while the little lady gets out of the water, right over there.
The first of you bindlestiffs that looks around...
...you'll get the meat end of this rifle right between the eyeballs.
- All right, you can get out now, honey.
- Get out?
If you stay in there, you're gonna catch cold.
You want them to stay and have breakfast with us?
- Well, these are my friends.
- Oh-!
Sir, we really gotta be going.
No fooling, we're late now.
Where are we going?
Listen, ma'am. Uh...
I'm awful sorry we, uh, discommode you.
I hope you won't hold no, uh, you know, grievance against old Cim.
I tell you, when I was a little buster, no bigger than a rabbit...
...I used to follow Cim around everywhere he went.
He spit on a stump, I spit on a stump.
And all I ever wanted was just to grow up and be like him.
And so if I've done anything at all, anything to come between you and him, uh...
All right. All right.
- Skimmeroot.
- Ha-ha-ha!
Honey, I'm afraid you hurt my friends' feelings.
I hurt their feelings?
I'm afraid you did. Come on, dear.
In the West, you never turn a man away without a hot meal in his stomach.
It just isn't done.
Oh, well, you'll learn.
There we go. There, now.
Come on, now, you're still not scared, are you?
No, I'm not scared.
I'm just frozen and cold.
All right, dear.
And don't you dare talk to me again until I tell you you can.
All right, I won't talk to you anymore.
Not until you tell me.
You all right now?
No.
What happened?
What's the matter? You lose your horse?
Never had none.
Where you from?
Missouri.
You mean to tell me you walked all the way from Missouri?
I guess so. I'm here.
Suppose you get in out of the rain and ride with us.
- You wouldn't object to that, would you?
- I wouldn't, but maybe you might.
I got my family with me.
Oh, we'll make room.
- Yancey Cravat.
- Tom Wyatt.
Hi, Tom. This is my wife here, Sabra.
Sabra, this is Tom Wyatt.
How do you do, Mr. Wyatt?
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.
That's my family.
Now, what was that you said about making room?
Well, I said we could, I guess we can.
I guess.
Come on, we got a ride.
Let's get out of the rain.
Come on, you itty-bitty.
Pa got a ride for us.
- Itty-bits, you'll fall.
We got a ride.
- What is it, Tom? What is it?
Ha-ha-ha.
This is my wife, Mrs. Wyatt.
And this is my children. Janet.
- You wanna meet my children?
- No, never mind for now.
Suppose you take this wagon.
Listen, you take my wagon, and you children...
...half of you get in the other wagon and half of you get in this wagon, all right?
That's right.
Come on, you itty-bits.
Go get in his wagon...
...before this poor man change your mind.
Which ones go in which wagon?
It doesn't matter.
Just so we're half and half.
Hold them up there, boys.
Man, ain't that something?
- Hey.
- Get on back to the line.
I guess we made it, Sarah.
I guess we did.
Hey, you.
Hey, you can't stop there.
Hey. Yancey.
Hi, Ned. How are you, boy?
Fine, fine. Ma'am.
Haven't seen you since you were selling
Indian ponies to the cavalry.
Not in that business anymore?
No, I gave that up.
It's really something, isn't it?
Yeah, just one big headache to me...
...trying to keep all them too-sooners out of there.
I sure hate to think about tomorrow.
Look at all of them.
We haven't got enough land for one-third of them.
There's gonna be an awful lot of mad and disappointed people...
...to say nothing of the dead ones.
You mean all this land and there won't be enough?
No, honey. The land around here ain't fit to raise goats on.
But over there, right over there...
...just about, oh, I'd say about 10 or 15 miles...
...you never seen such rich farming and grazing land.
That's the land we'll have to run for.
Hey, I don't believe it.
I don't believe it.
Hey, Ike, where you been?
Where you been?
Hey, you're all dressed up like a prune picker.
Have you seen Sam Pegler?
There's 10,000 people down there and he's one of them.
Wait till you meet Sam, he's really something.
He must be something.
Yancey won't stop talking about him.
How about taking our picture?
Take my picture.
All right. All right.
We'll make a nice, big group shot.
All right, now, watch the birdie.
Take our picture.
- Take my picture.
- Take our picture.
My bird's kind of stringy.
How's yours, pretty?
Don't blame it on the bird.
Even butter's stringy to you with those horrible, misfitting, store-bought teeth.
Mike, you old frog-sticker.
How you doing?
Well, I'll be. Yancey.
Have you seen Sam Pegler anywhere?
Not yet, but he'll be here.
Hey, Ike, look who's here.
I seen him this afternoon.
How are you, Cim?
I'm fine. Hi, Grat.
- You didn't waste any time, did you?
- Come and see me.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Where do you know these people?
- You know everybody.
- Oh, honey, they-
Hey, Cimarron.
- Hey, Dixie, there's Cimarron.
- Yancey, how are you? Where you been?
Where?
Who's that?
Oh, uh, it's nothing, honey, they're sort of friends of mine, ahem, you know.
Well, he could have wrote you at least.
Uh... Well, I'll explain it all to you someday, dear.
Pins. I have pins, needles.
Calico. Hamburg lace.
Hey, mister, mister, come over here.
Come here.
Have you any candy for the children?
Candy for the children? Plenty.
Help yourself.
There's all kinds of candy there.
There's red and green and yellow and licorice.
There's licorice down below.
Did you get it? Huh?
You look so young, madam.
How long have you been married?
Two weeks.
Two weeks?
- Lady, the candy is on the house.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Wait a moment, mister, no, listen.
These are not our children.
Honey, it's all right.
Hey, Tom, that's Pegler's wagon up ahead.
I'll see you there.
Come on, buddy, let's go there.
Indians got as much right to be here as anybody else.
Sam Pegler,
I want you to stay out of this fight.
Somebody's got to help him.
- Look at those fellers. That's a darn shame.
- Terrible.
Look at the baby.
Back to the reservation.
Send them back where they come from.
Wait a minute. This fellow's got as much right here as you have.
You stay out of this, old man.
Shame's on you. Well, I-
Stop it!
All right, break that fight up.
Separate those men.
What's this commotion all about?
This Indian's got just as much right to be here as anybody else.
Let me have your papers.
Now, this man has been legally registered.
And according to law, he's got as much right to make this land run as you have.
You heard what I said.
Now, go on, get back to your wagons.
The Indian stays.
Now, go on, break this up.
Go on. Now, move along, everybody.
Go on, move along.
I wanna tell you something, old man.
You try to run that newspaper of yours up here...
...the same way you did down in Texas...
...you're gonna get buried here.
And I don't care who your friends are.
Let's go, Millis.
Man, you really are something, Sam.
- You can't keep out of trouble, can you?
- Now, why should I?
Why should you?
Honey, this is Sam Pegler.
This is my wife, Sabra.
Your what?
Well, ma'am, I'm pleased to meet you.
Mavis, come look who's hooked himself a wife.
Oh, you poor girl.
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute.
Just don't pay no attention to her, because...
This is Jessie Rickey.
- How do you do?
- You know what he is?
He's one of the best printers in the business, when he's sober he is, that is.
Well, you know the last time he smiled, it caused an earthquake.
- You done pretty good in that fight.
- How do you mean, pretty good?
He almost got himself killed, risking his life for an Indian.
Sorry.
Suppose we, uh, give this fellow a hand here and get this wagon turned up.
Sir, do you mind if we help you?
Why don't you get on that side here.
- Sam Pegler.
- Yancey Cravat.
- Sol Levy.
- My wife.
Tom, suppose you go down to that end.
Now, watch it when-
- Tom Wyatt.
- Jessie Rickey.
Sam, take good care of it.
Yeah, I'll watch it.
That's my wife.
All right, let's go all together. Heave!
- Why do they call you Cimarron?
- It's a long story.
He's mean and wild and crazy.
That's what the word means.
Come on, you wanna make her think she married a wildcat?
She didn't marry a scat rabbit.
Do you know what you married?
A lunatic.
- He don't know what he wants.
- I do.
- Do you now? Now, do you?
- Of course I do.
How many things you been already?
A gambler, a gunman, a lawyer.
Now you wanna be a farmer. Bah.
No. I don't wanna be a farmer, I wanna be a rancher.
- I give you just two months.
- That's different.
You'll be pulling your hair out with both hands.
No. No, not this time.
This is the first time in my life
I've seen a piece of land and I said:
"This is what I want. "
More than anything, this is what I want.
You know how long
I've been dreaming about that land?
You know how long?
Ever since I used to ride herds through this country.
I used to lean down, pick up a big handful of that earth and smell it.
It was so rich.
You know how you do?
It smelled so rich you felt like you just...
You just throw out a handful of seeds and a whole crop of corn would sprout up.
Ten feet high.
That's what I wanna do.
I wanna grow my own food and raise my own cattle.
Now, just a minute.
There's only one thing wrong with that little dream of yours.
Corn just don't pop up 10 feet tall.
No, it's gotta have plowing and planting and weeding and watering.
- And then along comes a drought. Ruined.
- Shh.
- All right.
- And as for that fictional cattle-
All right. All right. Ha-ha-ha.
Say, you really are something, young fellow.
Come on, little lady.
We've got a rough day ahead.
I'll get out the bedroll here.
Good night. Good night.
Oh, ma'am, I don't want you to think we meant nothing by what we were saying.
- We were just joshing him.
- Oh, I know.
Oh, there is just one thing, though.
You see, we kind of raised that lunatic.
He's kind of like a son.
Well, we never had any children of our own.
And I was just thinking, you being his wife and all...
...maybe you could talk him into trying the newspaper business.
It isn't so much for ourselves.
Well, now, wait a minute, Mother.
That enters into it.
You see, a man hates to work...
...and have everything that he stood for just disappear.
- Well, it's just that-
- Kind of like to pass it on to somebody.
Yeah. You see, we need somebody to leave things to.
- Sam.
- And-
Listen, how many times...?
You never give up, do you?
I told you
I don't like the newspaper business.
I just don't like this business of being a crusader all the time.
- It's an embarrassing thing, you know.
- Who's a crusader? I'm not a crusader.
You are, Sam, you are a crusader.
Isn't that right?
Every time some unpopular cause comes along...
...old Sammy gets himself right in the middle on the wrong side.
Somebody's got to.
- That's what I'm talking about.
That's exactly what I mean.
No, sir, you're not gonna catch me spending my time-
Wasting my time behind a desk.
Just look out there, look at all those people.
Isn't that a sight? And every one of them, every one of them have some sort of dream.
What's the use of any of us being here...
...if we're not chasing some sort of a dream of some kind?
There they are out there.
Good men, bad men, lawmen, gunmen, horse thieves, wanted men...
...men not wanted so much by anybody or anything, anyplace.
But they've all got that dream in their head.
They've all got that new life they're hoping to lead sometime.
And how many of them...
...four out of five, ain't gonna make no life...
...ain't gonna find no land, no nothing?
That's good old Mavis.
I don't know how you put up with her all these years.
Well, somebody's got to.
I know. Come on, honey.
Good night. Good night, Sam.
Good night.
I love you.
Stand by.
You know, you're welcome to use one of my horses.
The way I ride, I'd never be able to hold my own against these boys.
Don't worry about it, honey.
We come this far, didn't we?
I didn't come this far to get done out of my land.
Bye, Pop.
- I'll get my land somehow.
- Bye, Pa.
And what's gonna happen if you miss that stagecoach?
Well, I'll worry about that when I come to it.
All right, now.
Suppose you take this along just in case, huh?
- Thanks, for everything.
- Good luck, Tom.
Come on, itty-bit, go back to the wagon now.
Hope you get your land.
Pa's gotta go.
You just stay with your ma, now.
How on earth are we ever gonna find you?
You all stay with the folks. I'll find you.
Let's say goodbye to Daddy.
- Bye. Bye. Bye.
- Bye.
Bye.
- Yancey, can you see our land from here?
- No.
It's in that direction, though.
Way out there there's a big grove of trees, and then there's this gully.
On the other side of the gully, there's this big hill...
...and on top of that hill, there's some of the finest grazing land you ever saw.
You best come in town with us.
- You mean that the town's already set up?
No, no, no, they have it, uh...
These certain sections plotted off into, like, town lots.
Is that right? And all the rest is divided up into farms.
- One hundred and sixty acres apiece.
- Yeah.
- And it's free?
- Yes.
All this wonderful land just here to take.
They're about ready.
I'm gonna saddle up.
Huh? Oh.
What a foolish sight. An old character like you racing like a tomcat.
Never mind the lecture.
Help me get this rheumatic old knight on his wooden charger.
I said, take your hands off me, both of you.
Since when do I have to have help getting up on a wagon?
Come on, Sir Galahad, upsy-daisy.
- Come on, you.
- Ahh...
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Take good care of that wildcat, Sabra.
He won't be easy to tame.
I will.
Hey, Dixie, where'd you get them pants?
Hey, Dixie.
Hello, Dixie. You racing for land?
I already know the land I want.
Hey, Dixie. Hey, Dixie.
Hey, Dixie.
Yancey, who is she?
Well, I gotta tell you all about that someday, honey.
Now, look, you stay back here till the race gets started, right?
Now, you come on, itty-bits, get in that wagon.
Come on, get out of the way of them horses.
You come with me, baby. Get over there.
Get up there, Nellie.
Never mind about that thing, just get up.
I got two hands and I can't handle all of you.
Well, we're off to the hunt.
Exciting, what?
What? Cecil, button your duster.
Yeah, or I'll button it for you.
- I got money, I got money.
Okay, get on the back if you can.
I paid.
I gave the man up there the money.
Let me on. Let me on here.
Get ready.
It's Pa. I think it's Pa. He didn't make it.
Is Pa hurt? Is Pa hurt?
I'll do it myself.
I got to do it myself.
I got to do it myself.
Hey, soldiers, I crossed the line.
I crossed that line, didn't I?
I crossed that line.
I got my land. I got my land.
I got my land.
Nellie. Go, girls.
Nellie.
Hyah! Hyah!
Get him.
Aah! Help, Yancey!
This is my land now.
Well, how about that?
Yeah, how about that?
Yeah, the land is so rich out here, all you gotta do is toss out a handful of seeds...
...and up pops a corn patch 10 feet tall.
So I'm told.
- Now, come on, Dixie.
- Don't come near me.
So help me, I'd sooner put a bullet through you than not.
You know, I think you would too.
Yancey.
Yancey, did you get the land?
Well, I didn't exactly get the land I wanted, but, uh, well, I got to thinking.
Uh... After all, we're not farmers, so, what would we want a farm for?
But...
It's not worth it.
What do you wind up with?
I'm a woman.
Where are my children?
I'm a woman. Where's my house?
I'm a woman.
Where's my man?
You, my rheumatic old knight.
Who's gonna climb up on our wheezy old charger...
...and lead us into the thick of things?
What good is it without you?
Anything?
I'm lonesome.
Already, I'm just plain lonesome.
Come on.
Hurry, let's get these claims.
I got mine.
You gotta line up.
I'm in a hurry.
Line up to file claims for your land.
First come, first served.
- Line up, don't block the door.
Let's go, hurry up.
Uh...
Jessie, suppose you stay and, well, you help me run the paper.
Are you sure you want to do it?
Somebody has to.
My, what a lot we've seen together, you and me and this, this wicked old...
Well...
I wish you would change your mind and stay with us.
No, Sam left a lot of things he was fixing to do...
...and I might just as well get going.
Yancey, you're getting right smack in the middle of things.
You'll only end up getting yourself killed too.
- Goodbye.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, I better get myself situated.
Yeah, I guess we all better.
You know where to find me.
Listen, everything will be all right.
Honey, you stay here.
I have something to attend to.
Yancey.
- Yancey, Yancey, where are you going?
- Before you know I'm gone, I'll be back.
Yancey, please, don't go looking for trouble. Please.
There are things a man has to do a woman doesn't understand.
- It's different here.
- Suppose he kills you.
What's going to happen to me?
What can I do here, all by myself?
Yancey, please.
Don't go looking for trouble, please.
Oh, please.
You must help me, please.
I'm so afraid.
I don't know what to do.
It's this place.
Is this where we're going to settle down and raise a family?
- It's all right, please.
- Oh, darling, I'm so...
- I hate to be afraid.
- Oh, please.
Sabra, please, it's my fault. It's my-
- I wanna make you happy.
- I've gotta take care of you more.
But just help me. Tell me what to do.
- I love you. Shh.
- Please don't leave me.
Wait, darling, wait, please.
Listen. Listen, I need you far more than you need me.
- You help me. You help me, darling.
- I just love you so much.
We just gotta be patient with each other, that's all.
Yes.
What are we going to do? Hmm?
We're gonna go home.
- Yes.
- Oh, no.
Oh, no.
We came to stay, didn't we?
And we are going to stay.
- No?
- You. Oh...
Sabra. Sabra, over here.
- Sabra, when's the baby due?
How are you?
- Well, a couple of weeks from now.
- You poor thing.
Come on. Take a blow there.
- No, Kid.
- Come on.
- One, two, three, four...
- Kid, no!
- No, I don't wanna go.
- Walk it out.
I'm gonna shoot the bottles out of his hands.
- I don't want- No.
- Take bets now, I've got $5.
- I got $50 say you don't.
- Fifty?
We ain't seen $50 at one time in our lives.
- Anyone could take all or a piece of it.
I'll take all.
Just one thing.
I don't see any point in killing a white man.
Hey, Moses. Yeah, you.
Or is it Izzy?
If you're talking to me, the name is Sol-
Stand still.
Hold up your arms.
When I speak, you jump.
You hold up your arms or I'll cut you from end to end.
Let's shoot.
Hey, Moses, don't you worry about a thing.
All right, everybody, clear out.
Clear out back there.
I gotta see what I'm shooting at.
Good night in the morning.
You again, ma'am?
- I'm sorry.
- Don't you "ma'am" me.
You bunch of good-for-nothing loafers.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself, playing with guns.
- You think they're toys?
- Sabra. Sabra, darling.
Take care of her, please, Sol.
Take a look, Millis. Millis!
Worth twice the price to see his face when those bottles broke.
Oh, if I ever see a guy that was scared, he was it.
I never seen anything so funny in my life.
There you go, Joe.
Get your money, men.
- You the one that did the shooting?
- Well, now, look who's here.
What's the matter, you got no white-men friends?
Now, I'm not gonna ask you again.
Was it you or wasn't it?
As a matter of fact it wasn't, but don't let that stop you.
I done it, Cim. I was the one.
What, are you gonna write that up in your paper?
I'll tell you, we'll really give you something to write about.
- Won't we, fellas?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What are you doing? I'm not a child.
You ain't no liquor-bellied saddle tramp, neither, like you're trying to be.
You think that's being tough?
Think that's being a man?
What are you doing?
Treating me like a child.
I don't want you hanging around with that crowd no more.
I'll get you in a hotel, give you a job on my newspaper.
- Wait, now, who do you think you are?
- Your friend, for one thing.
Think your daddy would be proud, the way you're gambling, spitting and drinking?
I ain't nothing.
You think I'm something, but I ain't.
I promised your father
I'd look out for you.
What if I help you out?
Send you back East to school?
Would you try to make something of yourself?
- No, Cim, I'm nothing.
- You better make up your mind, boy.
You go kill yourself the way your daddy did.
Nobody's gonna care.
And nobody's gonna stop you.
You know something?
I think if you put your mind to it, you could make something of yourself.
You hear me?
Maybe I have faith in you.
Oh, don't, Cim.
Just don't have faith in me, that's all.
- Please, don't have faith in me.
- Just think it over.
You just think it over.
Hey, Wes, Hoss.
Hey, skimmeroot! I'll see you, Cim.
Skimmeroot!
That Indian woman, what does she want?
Uh...
Honey, uh, there's a little something
I have to do.
- It's, uh, you know, I won't be very long.
- Darling, supper is ready.
Well, suppose you keep it warm for me.
Before you know I'm gone, I'll be back.
Stay with her until I get back, Jessie.
All right, hurry it up. Get him up there.
Back away. Back off.
Hah!
Mr. Jessie.
Mr. Jessie, please, would you get Sol to get Mrs. Wyatt?
- Yancey hasn't come back yet.
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.
- Are you sure?
I'm all right.
Let him hang.
He stole one of my horses.
Now we wanna see the rest of the Indians watch him.
You heard what I said.
I heard you.
I was against it, Yancey.
I told the Indian he wouldn't be safe here.
I didn't think they'd go this far.
Why isn't Yancey back yet?
You got no call to worry about Yancey.
He'll take care of hisself.
I'm really scared of everything.
Well, why shouldn't you be?
Now, you drink this now.
Come on.
Pretty good whisky.
Ain't gonna do you no harm.
It won't be as terrible as everybody says, having a baby?
- That one hurt, didn't it?
- Just a little.
Well, it's supposed to hurt a little, along about this time.
- Here, drink it.
- More?
Good for you.
Nothing for you to do now but lie back and enjoy it.
What are they laughing so much?
What is there to laugh at at a time like this?
- Don't you drink?
- Not when I'm having a baby.
What are you so nervous?
You'd think you had 10 babies already, you wouldn't be nervous.
I'm not nervous, just thirsty.
No.
Cimarron.
What kind of a name is that?
Yancey insisted on it.
- What if he's a girl baby?
- A girl?
- Yancey would send her right back.
- Ha-ha-ha.
I bet he would.
I can't have a girl.
No? Well, that's what I said.
And I got eight girls.
I've got eight of them.
Gentlemen, you're fathers.
- Yancey, what...?
- Shh. Shh.
It's all right, baby. It's all right.
Shh. There.
Oh, my darling.
- Hey, Tom.
- How are you, Yancey?
Hey, that's quite a contraption you got there.
- It look anything like it ought to look?
- Well, how ought it to look like?
Here's a picture in the magazine.
Where? That it?
How about that?
You really done it, huh?
- Seven hundred feet down now.
- Yeah?
And I ain't found enough oil to grease a fiddle.
Yancey, for once I'm afraid
I don't think too much of your advice.
I could have stuck those Eastern dudes with this whole useless farm at $25 an acre.
You wait a minute, Tom.
I figured those Eastern dudes you talk about.
They're not gonna just give their money away.
For something they don't want on top of this ground...
...there must be something underneath.
Yeah, but how far underneath?
I don't know how far down...
...but look, if you strike water, you'll still be ahead.
- I'll strike China first.
- Ha-ha.
Look, I'll tell you how you gotta figure it, Tom.
If you weren't sitting around digging for oil, then what would you be doing, huh?
Nothing.
- That's what I mean.
Tom!
- I'll see you, Tom.
- So long, Yancey.
Come on in, it's time to eat.
- Oh, hush, woman.
You come on in now, Tom.
Food's on the table.
- Hi there.
- Hello, Sarah.
- Will you come on in now?
- Hush, woman.
- Come on in now, Tom.
- Oh, hush, talk, talk, talk.
I swear, I think he's gone clean out of his head.
He don't do nothing but stay out here with that thing, whatever it is.
Meantime, the potatoes are rotting in the ground.
Everybody's laughing at the fool.
Oh, hush, woman.
Will you come on in?
I'm gonna throw your chitlins to the hog.
You know what you can do with my chitlins?
Hey, he sure has managed to keep hisself busy...
...these past few years, hasn't he?
You'd think they were hunting a mad dog or something.
Why is it you always have to take the wrong side of everything?
Every paper in the territory has got an editorial.
"The most dangerous public enemy since Billy the Kid. "
Yeah.
" If the territory of Oklahoma is ever going to be made a state...
...these killers must be stopped. "
- Sabra-
- Only you in the world could have the nerve-
You don't understand. You just don't-
Eight innocent people have been killed and how many banks have they robbed?
Yeah.
When I first knew that boy, his father was one of the biggest landowners...
...one of the biggest ranchers in this territory, Jessie.
The government come along and they decide they're gonna break up...
...that grazing land, and give those ranchers three days.
Imagine that.
Three days to get rid of their herds.
You know as well as I do that buyers take advantage of a situation like this.
And in one day, this man loses everything he spent all his life building up.
In just one day.
Now, you know what happened to him, Sabra?
Do you know?
In four months, he was shot for being a cattle rustler.
There, now, supposing, just supposing, Sabra...
...you were 8 or 9 years old, like that boy was.
What do you suppose a thing like that would do to you?
I didn't know that.
Terrible thing is,
I could have helped that boy.
I could've done something for him.
I don't know what, but I...
I just didn't bother. I didn't...
I didn't take the time.
- If you hadn't been so stupid, we-
- What are you bringing that up for?
- I made a mistake.
- You won't listen to nobody, will you?
Every time I bring up the town of Osage, you change the subject on me.
That couldn't have anything to do with Yancey Cravat, could it?
I'm sick of you.
I'm sick of looking at you.
And I'm sick of hearing your voice, and I'm sick of smelling you.
Go where you want to, will you?
Just get away from me.
That's fine with me.
Hoss, you coming with me?
I go with him.
That's good enough.
Wes.
All right.
You wanna get the train?
We'll get the train.
To tell you the truth,
I don't care no more what we do.
Come on, Hoss.
Hey, Dixie.
How are you?
Hi, Dixie.
Pretty nice rig.
I'm looking for a lawyer.
Are you still a lawyer?
Well, I... Uh...
I'm not much of a one anymore,
I'm afraid.
I don't need much of a one.
Right.
In that case, I'm your man.
Here, would you like to sit down?
Well, now, what can I do for you?
Hurry up, Yancey, we'll be late.
Oh, uh, do you mind running along?
I got business to attend to.
It will just take a few minutes.
Would you mind if...? Um-
No, no. I wait for you.
- Honey, honey.
- Yes, you go play.
Cimarron, you can go and play with Ruby in the yard, but don't go out in the street.
Honey.
Uh... Do you mind if we have a little privacy? It...
It's a...
- Well, it's customary, you know.
- But I'm not listening.
Who wants to listen? Go right ahead.
I don't want to listen.
Do you want to listen, Mr. Jessie?
Well, suppose we step outside, hmm?
Look, all I want is some legal papers.
I'm selling the farm.
- Now, can you draw them up for me?
- You're selling the farm?
Just answer me yes or no.
If you can, fine.
If you can't, I'll go someplace else.
Yes, of course,
I can take care of that for you.
Well, here's all the particulars.
You know, who's buying and for how much and all that.
And when you get them done, just bring them out to the farm.
Well, would you believe a human being could have such nerve?
She wants him to draw up the papers for the...
I think it's about time right now that you tell me about this woman.
There's really nothing to expl-
The Cherokee Kid, got him cornered at depot.
Get the Cherokee Kid.
The Cherokee Kid gang.
- Hoss, come back here.
- Hoss.
Cim. Cim, come back.
Cim.
If you hadn't been so stupid, we wouldn't have gotten in this mess.
We shouldn't have come to Osage.
All right, so I didn't figure it right.
Well, we gotta get out of here.
They'll be around us any minute.
Hey, the schoolhouse.
Yeah, they won't figure on shooting us in there.
Go on, all you kids. Get over in that corner.
Go on, get over there.
No. No.
Don't shoot, don't shoot. Are you crazy?
- There are children.
- My boy's in the schoolhouse.
- Get over there.
- Go.
- Hold on.
- Get over there.
- Cover the window!
- Get down. Get down on the floor.
Down, all of you.
All right, it's okay. Stay here.
My boy's in there. Please get my boy.
Take it easy, Johnson.
There's a lot of other kids in there.
Kid, I wanna talk to you.
Keep out of this, Cim, we don't want you in it. Keep out of it.
Don't come any closer!
If you wanna get these kids out of here alive, you drop the rifle.
Drop it!
Now, you get us our horses.
Sol, bring me their horses.
Come on.
Now, you bring them up to the door.
That's far enough.
Now we can get out of here.
- Wes, what are you doing?
- Mommy. Mommy.
- Wes. Wes, leave that girl alone.
- Mommy! Mommy!
- I'm coming out with a kid.
- Mommy! Mommy!
I'm coming out with this kid in front of me.
You're not coming out with any kid.
All right, you kids get out of here, all of you. Come on, move.
I told you not to have faith in me, didn't I?
Didn't I?
Skimmeroot.
You girls like hotcakes, right? Want some?
Careful. Watch it, now.
Want one?
I made it myself, you'll love them.
Have one. You'll like it.
Here's Mrs. Cravat.
She can tell you where Yancey is.
Oh, hey.
Yeah.
Mrs. Yancey Cravat-
- Now, hold on. Just hold on.
- Please.
- Please, one question-
- Hold on, now where's Yancey?
Leave me alone now.
Like I told you, you can read about it in the next issue of the Wigwam.
- Oh, that's not-
- Went for smokes, I guess.
Now, now you stay here.
I come back in a moment.
I just get changed.
There you are.
Everybody's looking for you.
Reporters from New York and every place.
They want to get some pictures of you receiving the checks.
I got them.
Here, darling.
Your reward money.
I don't take money for killing a man.
Then what was your reason for going in there?
I felt responsible.
What about your responsibility to us?
You risk your life for everybody else, any hopeless cause that comes along...
...but you tear up a check that could give Cim a little security for once.
You'd give our boy security by killing another man's son?
Yancey, I'd give anything to have kept you from going through what you did...
...but it's done now, and we might as well be practical, just for once.
Why don't you tear up our bills too?
All of them.
I don't care. Why should I?
Scrape the grubby ends together day by day.
Go ahead. Tear them up.
You wouldn't care if I took that money, huh?
How can I understand a man like you?
- Don't you know that we have a child now?
- Yes, yes.
He needs some money for some education.
He needs some money for some advantages in life.
Oh, but what does that matter to you?
That was his money you tore up.
What is that in you that...?
That hunger, whatever it is, to be there in the middle of any excitement?
You don't know the meaning of responsibility, do you?
What is it you want?
- Did it occur to you that you are wrong?
- Just wait-
No, no.
Everybody else is on the wrong side.
It's that I don't know what it is you want.
- I just want to be like everybody else.
- Yes, all right.
Well, perhaps you and I, we just...
Maybe you didn't think of this.
Maybe you and I see things differently.
Yes. I guess we do.
Know something else?
I don't know, maybe...
Maybe you picked yourself the wrong man.
And for you?
Am I the wrong woman?
I...
I can't please you.
I just can't please you, Sabra.
Son, I hope that someday, when you get to be an old man...
...you'll be able to tell your grandchildren that you saw the day...
...when this town became civilized.
- You understand what I mean?
- Yes, Daddy.
Yes, and that the things that are happening out there now are just...
They just can't happen and won't happen.
And there's something else, and this is even more important.
You listen to your mother.
Because she's the only one who makes sense around here.
You just don't doubt that for one minute, no matter what any...
What anybody says to you.
Now, there.
Let's make out we don't see her.
Now, look at our nice horse.
Our horse.
Yes, our horse.
Here you go. Fix him up.
And I says to myself:
"If I can only get that land, oh, I've got to get that land.
If I can get it, then I'm sure that most of my problems, they'll be...
Well, they'll be solved, you know.
Some way. "
Then I got to thinking that even if I had gotten the land...
...it wouldn't have solved most of my problems at all, really.
Depends on what your problems are,
I guess.
I guess so.
Well, you got the land, it didn't solve all of your problems.
I don't think. Did it?
It solved one thing, though.
It kept you from getting it.
Dixie.
Listen. Listen, now.
Did I ever tell you, did I ever say to you that we were gonna get married...
...and that we were gonna live here together?
- Did I ever? Did I ever s-?
- No. No.
I never did.
You never actually said you wouldn't, neither.
I thought about you a lot, a whole lot.
I love you.
No.
You came here to bring the papers, and you brought them, thank you very much.
Just leave the bill on the table.
A little breeze feels kind of good, huh?
Skimmeroot.
Do you feel better now?
Yeah.
I never could resist a little old hill to holler from.
Any time you wanna borrow my hill to holler from, you just holler away.
As long as I got it.
You do much?
- Hollering?
- Yeah.
Or don't you need to?
Me? I'm done hollered out.
Any ideas?
Oh, yes.
Sure, I've got a lot of ideas.
But a man just can't wear two hats.
No.
Not at the same time.
Well, what do you figure on doing now, Dixie?
Well, I don't know. Go back to what I ran away from, I guess.
You know, there's not much else I can do.
Of course, uh, if I had a man-
Oh, come on, now. Come on, here.
You never tried real hard to get a man, Dixie.
Because all you'd have to do is just bat your eyelashes...
...and you'd cause a stampede.
That's a fact.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, a man can always, uh, buy a new hat...
...if the one he's got don't fit him.
If he wants to.
Who do you think you're fooling?
Yourself?
You're not fooling me.
I know you, I see all the signs.
You left me and you're gonna leave her.
It's just a question of time.
And when you got those jumping meemies of yours like you always do.
I can see it right now on your face.
There ain't no family, no conscience in this world can hold you.
And you know it, don't you?
Tell me to my face I'm wrong.
Maybe you don't know me as well as you think.
Time for school, children.
Everybody in.
School's starting.
Last bell, children. Inside.
I wanna go to school, Daddy.
Oh, you do? Oh, it won't be long until you'll be old enough.
- And then you'll cry to stay home.
- No, he's not gonna cry. Are you, son?
- No, Daddy.
- No, you bet you're not.
Now, well, you look like a real little lady, darling.
You better hurry.
Don't want to start being late the first day.
Come.
Well, I hope she does better than I did in school.
I was kicked out of class the first day...
...for hitting the teacher with a hard-boiled egg.
- I bet you did.
- That's a fact.
- Daddy, look.
- Huh?
They don't want me.
The school board has considered your request on behalf of that Indian girl.
By unanimous decision, your request has been denied.
Meeting is adjourned.
You don't expect me to keep quiet about this, do you?
You can do what you want, Yancey...
...but I gotta tell you, all you'll do is make enemies for yourself.
If you love the Indians so much, you ought to make your living from the Indians.
You start printing nonsense about this and I'll pull out all my advertisements.
- So will a lot of other people I know.
That's right.
Good. Good.
Let's keep our children's blood pure and their heads empty.
Yancey, Yancey.
- Yeah?
Telegram from the news service just come in the depot.
What do we have here?
How about that?
Sabra?
How about that?
"President Cleveland proclaimed the opening of the Cherokee Strip, September the 16th. "
- The Cherokee what?
- Six million acres of land.
That makes that old puny run we were on just look like a Sunday school picnic.
What are you talking about?
Honey, uh...
Honey, don't-
- Please don't say no, yet.
- No.
I don't want to hear it.
Come on. Don't say no until-
Usually, we have a chance-
- We can discuss it, darling.
- I'm not interested.
Please, darling.
Please.
Let's go.
And leave everything?
Just when we were beginning to get a little established?
For what reason?
To start all over again with the dust and the mud and the shooting?
We've got a child now to be responsible for.
I'll tell you what we'll do, then.
All right, fine.
We'll go and we'll sort of take a vacation.
- What kind of a vacation?
- We'll just go and look at it.
This is the most important thing that's happened in the history of the world.
- You won't even go and look at it?
- I don't want to go.
Who's going to take care of Cim and run the newspaper?
All right.
All right, we'll take Cim with us.
- And Jessie, he'll run the newspaper.
- I don't-
- He's done it before.
- I don't even want to discuss it.
- Oh, honey.
- You get that crazy look out of your eyes.
We are not going.
We are not going.
And that's the end of it.
Well, I guess that's the end of it.
I guess, huh?
Come on, Yancey.
We're all waiting on you.
Are you sure you won't change your mind and come with me?
Son, you be real good to your mom, you hear?
Treat her real good, huh?
And I'll bring you something real nice.
Come on, now, don't look so sad.
Before you know I'm gone, I'll be back.
Make way! Move over!
Make way!
I wanna go with my daddy.
I wanna go with my daddy.
I wanna go with my daddy.
If you get shoes for one of them, you gotta get them for all of them.
Don't worry, Sol, I'll pay you.
When my oil well comes in,
I'll pay you double.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Take the shoes.
Thank you, Sol.
- Bye, Sol.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Sabra.
- Goodbye, Tom.
And now you.
I don't know, Sabra, you went to the bank and they wouldn't give you the money...
...so now you come to me for it.
Well...
What have you got to put up for security?
If I had something,
I wouldn't have to come to you.
Now, listen, Sabra, friendship is friendship, and business is business.
If you haven't anything to put up...
What's that?
Stem-winding clock?
I'll take the clock.
But that's a cheap watch.
You can buy one anywhere.
What are you talking about?
All my life,
I wanted a nice little clock like that.
You've got the loan,
I've got the security.
It's a deal.
- Close the door.
- Where is it?
On the table.
Cim, it's for you.
- For me?
- Yes, here.
Look.
Look, Ruby. It has my name on it.
It's a present to me from Alaska.
And there's a letter in it too. I'll bet you anything that your daddy's coming home.
I bet you anything.
What is it? A bearskin?
Yes, a lovely bearskin.
- It's a lovely bearskin.
- What am I supposed to do with that?
Now, don't be rude.
You know better than that.
It's not the gift, it's the thought that counts.
Now, be careful with the letter.
There must be a letter somewhere.
I don't see any letter.
Then it's somewhere around.
Oh, boy, look at this.
Boy, look at those teeth.
Oh, God, look at these claws.
Bet he was 8 feet tall.
Reckon he could eat a man.
Give my best to your husband the next time you write to him.
Yes, I will. Thank you.
Do you expect him back soon?
Well, it's hard to say.
He's away on business, as you know.
It's difficult to foresee the complications when you're away on big business.
It must be really big, to keep a man away from home for five years.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Evening.
Sol.
I thought you were a masher.
I am.
Walk you home?
All right.
What do you care?
Let them talk.
I guess one more piece of gossip can't hurt me.
Me? I only wish it was true.
Sol.
Why don't you get married, hmm?
Is that a proposal?
It would be, if I had any sense.
Ah, sense. Ha-ha-ha.
Already I'm finished.
Do you know what water is to fire?
That's what sense is to love.
Some people in love aren't crazy.
Love.
There's love and there's love.
Me? A woman might love.
But Yancey, if you'll excuse the expression...
...there's a man you could love.
Hey, Sol.
Oh...
Sol.
Thanks for the hat, I love it.
Isn't it a lollapalooza?
I'll, uh, see you later on.
Sol.
Well, listen, women...
It all comes out in the wash.
How can a woman walk like that?
You'd think she'd be embarrassed.
Listen, you tell me every day,
"It pays to advertise. "
Oh, no.
- Sol?
- Hmm?
Can I ask you a favor?
You know everything I've got.
Would you-?
- I mean, would you ask your friend?
- No.
You don't even know what I'm going to ask you.
Am I stupid?
Does she know where Yancey is, right?
- What else?
- So she does know.
- You have discussed it with her.
- Please, Sabra, don't ask for trouble.
So she does know.
Well, I better go and ask her myself.
Sabra.
Sabra, you can't.
I bet you I can.
Sabra.
Why don't you come in here? It's quieter.
Hey.
Hey, hey.
- Sit down.
- Here?
Yeah, we can talk in here.
Well...
I had a very good reason all prepared, an excuse for my being here.
But I don't think you'd believe me anyway.
That's good.
You seem to know me and how I operate.
You shouldn't get me confused with them kind you read about in the storybooks...
...you know, with the heart of gold?
If I had a heart of gold,
I'd have sold it long ago.
For twice what it's worth.
I guess you know essentially why I've come here.
I don't know nothing.
You want me to know something, you gotta tell me straight.
I have reason to believe that you know where my husband is.
- And?
- Naturally, I'd like you to tell me.
Where he is?
You're not making it any easier for me, are you?
Why should I?
Well, I haven't heard from my husband-
I mean, I haven't heard from the man in two years.
I don't know whether he's dead or alive.
He ain't dead.
Did he write to you?
Oh. So it ain't just where he is, you wanna know if he wrote me too.
Well, I don't think it's unnatural that I'd be curious.
You women really puzzle me.
You so-called respectable women.
Would you address me with my proper name?
You say anything because you want to?
- Not without worrying what people think.
- I didn't know I was getting a lecture too.
Is it free?
I don't give nothing free.
In that case, I'd better check the price before you continue.
It might not be worth it to me.
Your husband's in Cuba.
Him and two buddies.
He joined the Rough Riders.
Thank you.
Is that all you wanna know?
I'd like to know much more, but I doubt if it's any of my business.
- You really think that?
- No.
But I'm not going to give you the satisfaction of asking.
You know, I've always wondered how come a man like Yancey...
...married a woman like you.
And I think
I'm beginning to understand it.
Do you know also why he left me?
Don't you?
Probably.
I might as well tell you.
He didn't write me.
His buddy Matt did.
That surprise you, my telling you that?
Very much.
Yeah.
Kind of surprises me too.
I doubt if I'd have told you if the situation were reversed.
You know, I'd take him away from you in one second if I thought I could.
I'm glad you put it that way.
Oh, what a shame you don't know the hold you've got on that man.
Oh, I'm not sure of that.
You know, all I keep thinking is this saying I heard once...
...about the woman who is composed of three parts:
One part mother and one part companion...
...and one part, you know.
That.
It's that third part that worries me...
...and it's not because
I wouldn't like to, either.
Well, I'll tell you something, for what it's worth.
I wouldn't worry about that if I was you.
And I'm not exactly an amateur at spotting, you know, who's got what.
You really mean that?
Yeah.
You know, that's about the nicest compliment I've ever got.
Thank you. Good night.
Good night.
Good night. Thank you very much.
Good night.
Mrs. Cravat.
Good evening, Mrs. Lancey.
Good evening, Mrs. Kuye.
Well...
We all feel gay
When Johnny comes marching home
When Johnny comes marching home again
Hurrah! Hurrah!
Go ahead, Cim, find your daddy.
- Daddy.
- Hurry up, Ruby.
Come on, Ruby. Let's find Daddy.
Daddy. Daddy, Daddy.
"Welcome home, Daddy. "
Sabra.
Sabra, please don't be so stubborn.
The whole town is going to be at the train to meet him, it doesn't look nice.
I don't care how it looks.
If Yancey Cravat thinks he can disappear for five years with never a single word...
...and then come back and find me at the station waving a flag...
...and carrying a welcome sign,
I don't know who he thinks he is anyway.
And how he even has the nerve to come back here.
No matter how many Spanish hills he ran up and down.
And if he thinks he can just calmly walk back into my life...
...a person would have to be crazy to forgive an irresponsible, selfish-
And you, you stay right here, now.
Right here.
And you don't move.
And you see what I'm going to tell him.
I want an audience.
I'm telling you.
Yancey's not on this end.
- He ain't in there.
- Well, he's gotta be.
Daddy's not on the train, Uncle Jessie.
Daddy's not on the train!
All right, where is he?
He ain't on the train.
He didn't come back.
Are you sure?
That's him, all right. That's him all over.
You ought to have seen the faces of the committee.
They searched that train high and low.
No sign of him nowhere.
I won't get over it.
My love.
You know, son, I know that I haven't been very much of a daddy to you...
...but I would like to make it up to you, somehow, if you'd let me.
I...
I'd like to make it up to both of you.
Well, you think you'd give your old daddy another chance?
Hmm?
Now, do you think you might squeeze a little smile out for me?
I know I don't deserve one right now, but perhaps you could give me, uh...
...sort of an advance on one you might decide to give me next week.
How about it, son?
Let me in.
Let me in.
It's Tom. It's Tom Wyatt.
Let me in. It's Tom Wyatt.
It's oil! Look at it.
Smell it. Taste it.
Oil. I hit oil.
I hit oil. Oil.
It's oil.
We're rich.
Yeah, I never...
Oh, Lord.
Oh, no.
Well, there goes the money in the cookie jar.
Oh, my. What's so funny about that?
It's okay, Mama,
I'll go to college next year.
It is not funny.
- What do you think of all these statues?
- Wonderful.
Cost me $100,000 just to have them cleaned.
Sit down here, dear.
- May I help you?
- Sabra.
Thank you, Tom.
- Senator, here's one I got in Milan.
- Ha-ha-ha.
Call him a senator, old windbag.
He couldn't senate my Aunt Fanny.
Hors d'oeuvre, madam?
Where did you get them from?
Some little-bitty midget?
When I was poor, I used to have my sandwiches that were that thick.
Look at that.
Make half a dozen, six, seven sandwiches out of one measly piece of bread.
Hi, Yancey.
Hey, Tom.
Hi, folks.
Come here.
You want to hear something funny?
You know why they put that Indian reservation way out there, where they did?
Hi, folks.
Because that ground was so useless...
...they figured it was so worthless that nobody'd know what to do with it.
It'd just be useless.
Well, sir, those 2000 Indians squatting in their rags out there...
...are now just about the richest nation in the whole world.
Yes, sir, they've discovered oil on the reservation. Ha-ha!
How about that, huh?
Well, I call that divine providence, Sabra.
- Isn't that right, Tom?
- It sure is.
Wait till they find out
I got it all sewed up.
I own every drop of oil out there.
Ha-ha-ha.
Have a drink to my new oil field.
Come on, Yancey,
I'll pour you some champagne.
No, thanks.
Come on, Sabra.
Well, I just hope you're satisfied.
Every time I manage to get us socially accepted again in this town...
...you come along and do something against it.
You promised, too, didn't you...
...if you did come, you would behave like a gentleman?
- Didn't you promise me?
- Yes, yes.
What did Tom Wyatt do so terrible, huh?
He must have paid the Indians for their oil rights.
Nobody forced them to sell.
It's purely business, isn't it? Hmm?
I never thought of it quite that way.
I'm sure you didn't.
"Wyatt swindles Indians"?
Yancey, you're crazy.
You can't print this.
I told him I wouldn't run it off.
What's the point of having a newspaper if you can't have fun with it?
- Dad's right, Mother.
- I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to your father.
Now, this is out-and-out libel.
We'll be ruined.
Jessie, I'm gonna tell you something.
You know those Indians up there?
You know they're not gonna get 5 cents?
Not one nickel of all that oil money.
All those politicians and that Tom Wyatt.
Tom Wyatt, I tell you.
But you can't prove it!
I know I can't. I know.
Sabra, I know that I can't prove it.
But I'm gonna tell you-
Son, they don't know that.
Whenever you're dealing with crooks, you know what you have to do?
I mean, if you know you're right?
Well, I tell you, you just stir up a great big fuss, like we're doing right now.
And what happens to those crooks?
They just run.
Yes, sir, they just run just like a bunch of scared jackrabbits.
Yes, sir.
I tell you, we're gonna get that Tom Wyatt out of there...
...and we're going to make those Indians millionaires.
Now, give that a turn, will you, Jessie?
Turn around there.
That's it.
Yes. Yes.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry.
I've got my own skin to save.
Now, wait a minute, Rollins.
How'd they get the news in Washington?
From some little cheap, small-town newspaper?
Washington?
Every newspaper picked it up from the Associated Press.
Well, I ain't through yet.
You'll find there's more than one way
I can milk a bullfrog.
Yancey, look out.
Those crazy Indians.
What do they think, that they own the street?
You'd think one of them would stop and help you, after all you've done for them.
We'll just give it a little push and we'll be in fine shape.
Fellows, would you mind giving me a hand here?
Right.
I better walk.
I got Civic Club due in 10 minutes.
All right, dear. Here we go. Easy.
- Yancey.
- Yeah?
- Yancey.
- Yeah, what?
Congratulations.
- Yeah, what for?
- Lord, where is that darned thing?
Telegram just come in.
Thought maybe you'd like to see it.
They want you to come to Washington, get yourself appointed governor of the-
Oh, here it is. -territory.
Well, how about that?
Must be pretty hard up for politicians if they wanna make you governor. Ha-ha.
You're not joking there, boy.
Train leaves at 7 tonight.
I went around to check it.
Would you mind not telling Sabra about this for a while?
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?
Maybe I don't wanna be the governor.
- I don't get along very good with politicians.
- All I done was give you the telegram.
If you wanna keep it from her, that's your neck, not mine.
Well, I gotta get back.
Yeah, sure.
Well, how about that?
That's it.
What are you doing out here?
Just sitting out here?
I've got 23 women and they'll be here in a minute...
...and you just sitting out here.
Mother.
You are supposed to be helping Jessie this afternoon.
What are you doing out here?
Did you make the salad?
- Ruby-
- You didn't make the salad?
What are you doing?
What are you wearing?
I've got the Civic Club due here in a minute.
Mother, it's a big Indian festival day today.
- She told you about it.
- What big Indian festival?
I've got 23 women, they'll be here in a minute.
Did you make the pineapple and the marshmallow salad I told you to fix?
Not yet, dear.
But you can't walk out and leave me like this.
Well, that settles it.
They've got to go.
I have put up with their insolence, their arrogance...
...even their endless brood of relatives, but to ask me on a day like this-
You told her they could go.
I heard you.
I don't like this, young man.
I don't like it.
I promised I'd drive them out.
I won't discuss it. You are not going.
If you can't keep away from that girl,
I'll get her out of the house.
You go and do your work, just for once, or I'll have to talk to your father about it.
Oh.
- Hello.
- But-
- I'm Theresa Grayfox.
- I'm Sally Crowfoot.
- But she-
- Arita showed us what to do.
I hope we've got everything the way you like it.
But marshmallow.
You take my coat away. Oh.
Oh, Sarah.
- Looks like we're too early.
- No, it's fine.
It's just that everybody else is a little late.
You just walk right in.
Cim!
Hyah.
- Yancey?
- What?
It's almost 3 in the morning.
What?
Did you wake me up to tell me that?
I want to go out and get Cim.
He hasn't come home yet.
Oh, honey, leave the boy alone.
- But it's almost 3 in the morning.
- It's 3 in the morning, fine.
He's not a baby.
But I don't want him out there with those Indians all the time.
I'm worried to death what's happening to that boy.
He has got no drive, no ambition at all.
And that girl, that Ruby.
I really think they're getting serious.
Well, they are, well, that's just fine.
It shows he's got good taste.
Can't you see I'm worried?
Yancey.
We have got one son.
That's all we've got in this world...
...and I see him drifting away from us day by day.
And it's my fault, both of us.
Please, we've got to do something about that boy.
Please, before it's too late.
- Please.
- All right. All right.
You're really worried about him, aren't you?
You promised that you'd make up for all the things you never did for him.
Well, now is the time.
Please, Yancey.
We have got to find a way to get him out of this town...
...into a different kind of environment entirely.
I know we'll never be rich like everybody else, but if we find money enough to-
What's that?
Oh, no.
Oh, my.
This could be the answer to everything.
Do you know what it could mean for the boy to be the son of a governor?
It says they just want me to come up and talk about it.
- But-
- It doesn't say that I've got it yet.
So you mean there's a chance you might not get it?
Oh, you women.
If you didn't have anything to worry about, you'd worry about that.
Oh, but-
It's something new.
And I'm so nervous.
Why? What have you got to be nervous?
How about that? Look here.
Oh, I guess I don't know how to act among civilized people anymore.
Look at that.
Yancey, look.
- We are invited to a party tonight.
- Fine, that's fine.
Not a party, the party.
The Congressional New Year's Eve party.
Isn't that wonderful?
- Anything else, sir?
- Hmm?
No, uh, thank you very much, son.
Thank you, sir, and happy New Year.
- Happy New Year to you too.
- Same to you.
- Yancey, isn't that wonderful?
- Hmm? Yes, it is.
To Sabra, my Sabra.
- Happy New Year, darling.
- Happy New Year.
Who are the Lou Brothers?
Well, they're the, uh... Uh...
No, actually, no.
There's only one man, I think he's on the committee that recommends me.
I'm not sure, exactly.
What's he want to see you for right now?
Well, it beats me.
Oh, my goodness, what next here?
Do you think something's wrong?
I don't know if there's anything wrong.
I tell you what I can do.
I can take a run upstairs and find out what it's all about.
All right.
I suppose I do that while you put on your nice, pretty party dress for tonight.
How's that suit you, huh?
Oh, you suit me fine.
Hey, you know something, Sabra?
You know, I got to thinking...
...I don't know, all that you've had to put up with from me, all-
Being married to me all these years,
I don't know how you've- Ha-ha-ha.
I don't know how you've managed to do it.
You don't expect me to be noble and deny it?
No, now, I want to tell you something, though.
Tonight, being as it's New Year's Eve,
I'm gonna make a very special resolution.
You know what it is?
It's a resolution that I'm gonna try to make it up to you.
I'm gonna try.
Say, honey, I need a shave. Yeah.
- Would you promise me?
- Maybe I don't need a shave.
- Yancey, would you really promise me?
- Yeah.
I know what you're gonna say.
All right, I promise that tonight I'll, uh, try to behave like a perfect gentleman.
I'll try.
- You go ahead. You look fine.
- I wouldn't say that.
But you can't go with the cigar.
Give it to me.
- All right.
- Don't be too long.
I won't.
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What? What?
- No, wait.
- Honey, that's nothing.
Darling, I can't see. Turn around.
- Honey, that's okay, all right?
- That's it.
All right, okay.
Oh, how can I be so happy?
Well, Mr. Cravat, I'm Lou Brothers.
Come on in, sir.
Happy New Year to you.
It sure is a great honor to meet you, sir.
- Oh, this is Mr. Walters.
- Hello.
- Glad to know you.
- Mr. Self.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
- Mr. Greer.
- How are you?
- And Mr. Hodges.
- How do you do, sir?
You know, it's not often a man has a chance...
...to meet either a great newspaper man or a great American.
Here we have both, right in the same person.
Yes, sir, and a great war hero to boot.
It sure is getting deep in here.
Hi, Yancey boy. How was the trip?
Well, now,
I didn't expect to see you here.
Well, that's the funny thing about this city, always expect the unexpected.
Yeah. So I see.
Everything all right? Your room all right?
Oh, yes, it's fine. Just fine.
All right, sit down.
Why don't you make yourself at home?
All right.
Well, now, this looks like we're getting ready for an all-night poker session.
What are the stakes?
I just wanted you to meet some of my friends.
Some of the boys you'll be bumping into, once you're the governor.
Gentlemen, it's like the fellow says:
"What's good for oil is good for Oklahoma.
What's good for Oklahoma is good for the country.
What's good for the country, well, it's good for the whole wide world. "
The man can't say "Pass the sugar" without bringing tears to your eyes.
Is there anything special you'd like to do or see here in Washington, Mr. Cravat?
I'd be more than happy to have my office take care of the whole thing.
Let me fill up your drink, governor.
Oh, hold on there, Tom.
I'm not the governor yet, you know.
It's just a little matter of signing your name.
- Am I right, men?
- Yes, sir.
- If you say so, Tom.
- Right.
The thing is, Yancey...
...you're talking to the committee right now.
Whoever we recommend will automatically get it.
- Are those real diamonds you got on there?
- Yeah.
My, would you look at that.
Two of them, huh?
You know something, when I see the way you've sprouted up, Tom...
...you know, the way, all this-
My goodness, it's really something.
Yes, sir.
And I ain't forgotten my old friends, neither.
Just like I know they won't forget me.
What do you mean by that?
You sure squeeze a man into laying it on the line, don't you?
I wouldn't say that, I mean I just want to sort of try it out and see what happens.
Well...
Let me put it this way, Yancey.
Ain't nobody gonna ask a man to do anything out-and-out dishonest.
Why, of course not.
But at the same time, a little cooperation-
No cooperation, and no governor, is that it?
I guess that's about it.
I see.
That's good liquor you serve here.
Well, we'll see, Tom.
We'll see.
Happy New Year, gentlemen.
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, Yancey.
Oh, my, I can't get over it.
I just can't get over it.
My husband is going to be the governor, and I'm dancing.
Oh, come, let's dance again, please.
I want to swing around and around and around and around.
Oh, Yancey. I'm dizzy.
I was so afraid you'd disappoint me.
I didn't even want to think about it, your getting made governor...
...because every time I used to count on something, I'd only get disappointed.
But this time, this time when I really didn't think of it...
Oh, Yancey,
I want you to know how grateful I am...
...for what you do for Cim and me.
- Yancey.
- Sabra.
Sabra, there's something
I've got to talk to you about.
I can't do it, Sabra. I can't, I'm sorry.
Now, I know I promised and I gave my word...
...and I'm going back on that word, but I just can't go through with it.
I wanted to be governor for you and for Cim more than anything in the whole world...
...but I can't.
So that's the end of it?
I'm sorry I have to disappoint you once more, my darling.
But I can't do it.
No.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And days of auld lang syne
All right, that's the end of it.
Sabra.
What do you want me to say?
How am I going to go back and tell everybody you didn't get it?
I keep on watching everybody getting richer and richer.
We don't even have the money to get our own son out of trouble.
You talk as though the only thing we've got to do is to give him a big bank account...
...and everything will be all right.
No, Sabra, no.
We can't live his life for him, Sabra...
...and we can't expect him to live our lives for us.
Yancey, I have forgiven you a lot.
More already than I should have.
But I'm telling you now, if you disappoint us in this...
...I'm through.
- I'm just through.
- Don't say that, Sabra, please.
If you can't for your own son, you are selfish.
Can't you ever do anything for anybody except yourself?
Don't say that. Don't say that,
Sabra, please don't.
Go on. Go on.
Go away from me.
Leave me alone, forever.
But eight stories.
I know what I'm doing.
- We need it.
- You what?
At least, we will need it.
Two hundred thousand dollars.
That's a lot of money, Sabra.
I mean, you want to expand, all right.
Build yourself a little building, but that's a lot of money.
Didn't I always pay you back? Before?
Before? Before. Before.
Before, I loaned you 5, $600.
But $200,000?
What can you put up for security?
A very good dinner, Sabra. I enjoyed it.
Sorry I have to rush off like this, but you know how it is, business before pleasure.
I've got a lot of these things at home.
- Listen to that old fool talk business.
- Now, hush, Sarah.
High muckety-muck talk, that's all it is.
Just talk.
- Second childhood.
- I'll second-childhood you...
- ... in about two minutes, you know it.
- You know who I miss?
I miss old Yancey, the ornery old son of a gun.
Remember the time he picked us up?
On our way to the starting line.
If we're gonna go, let's go, you old tomcat.
Well, we'll be seeing you.
In a couple of months, when we get back from Paris, France.
Have a good trip.
- Bye.
- You take care of yourself.
I will.
Hi, boy.
- Good evening.
- How are you, Ruby?
Mrs. Wyatt.
Hello, Ruby.
My dear.
- Hello, Mother.
That was a good meal, wasn't it?
Well...
Why didn't you call and let me know you weren't coming home for dinner?
That's the least you could have done, no? Let me know?
I thought you knew we had guests.
Dinner was arranged accordingly.
That is impolite.
Mother.
Well?
Ruby and I have gotten married.
I know we should have told you before.
But I knew what your attitude would be.
Well...
What am I supposed to do now?
Am I supposed to kiss you...
...and tell you how happy I am?
No.
No.
We're leaving tonight.
I've got a job.
It's in Oregon.
Mother.
We did wanna say goodbye.
You needn't have bothered.
You go, you go, there's nothing to talk about.
If you want to throw your life away, then you just go ahead and do it.
Like your father did before you.
If you want to go, then go.
Aha. What are you doing here so late?
- We've been looking all over for you.
- How are you, Sabra?
We just came from your home and every place.
I've been trying to dream up something special to say...
...about the anniversary issue tomorrow.
So far, all I've got is a big, fat blank.
Sabra, this is Jacob Krubechoff, the famous sculptor.
I'm very honored.
How do you do, Mr. Krubechoff?
He's the best there is.
Half a million is nothing to ask for his stuff.
He wouldn't even pick up a chisel for a quarter of a million.
My work, I'm afraid, doesn't impress them half as much as my price.
Oh, dear Mr. Krubechoff.
The thing is, Sabra-
You know I'm building a university?
With all the children I got, it's cheaper to build one than to send them all to college.
Well, anyhow, I hired Mr. Krubechoff here to put me up some kind of a statue...
...something that'll stand for the Oklahoma pioneer.
- That's wonderful.
- We got to talking.
We all decided, the whole committee...
...that nobody stood for the spirit of the pioneer like you did.
So that's how come we wanted
Mr. Krubechoff to talk to you and all...
...and we thought maybe you'd pose and everything for him.
- Am I right, Sol?
- Yeah, yeah, yes, you know.
Something nice, like you and the little boy in a covered wagon.
Something nice, very simple.
But you're out of your minds.
I haven't decided yet what should be the best to represent-
Whatever it is, the spirit...
...but I would appreciate, maybe you'd talk to me.
Talk.
I'm afraid they have given you the wrong idea.
I was just sitting here thinking, as a matter of fact, you know...
...nothing really has turned out the way I thought it would.
My son and- Look at this.
That's my son.
My son, he had to run away to get married, to do what he wanted to do.
They won't live in the same state with me.
He won't even write me a letter once in a while.
And my husband. This is my husband.
He had to run away too.
I haven't heard from him in about 10 years.
- The newspaper, nothing, noth-?
- The news-
What's the newspaper? The newspaper.
Oh, my dear.
I've made it bigger, louder, more profitable.
Yes, I have made it more profitable.
But it hasn't got the spirit it had when my husband was here.
But, Sabra, please,
I mean, this whole thing-
And that's what you want to symbolize, the spirit of the pioneer, with me?
Oh, Tom.
This is very sweet of you, Tom.
What Sabra means is-
I think he knows what I mean.
Don't you?
- Let's all go and have a cup of coffee.
- I have no time.
- I'm sorry, I have to-
- Have you got the editorial?
No, I haven't got the editorial, but-
I'm trying to squeeze out something at least.
- Please forgive me-
- Look, this will take five minutes.
The newspaper will not run away.
- You will have a cup of coffee.
- That's enough.
You might as well go ahead.
- They've waited this long.
- What's happening?
- Coffee will make us all think.
- Off you go.
- You are out of your mind, all of you.
- Come on.
What's come over you?
You know what I ought to run tomorrow, in place of the editorial?
I was just thinking about it before.
We just go down for a cup of coffee.
One little woman told me once-
You remember her, Sol, Jessie?
Her name was Mrs. Pegler and she told me-
It was on the day when her husband got killed in the land rush.
" It's not worth it," she told me.
"I'm a woman," she said.
"Where are my children?
I'm a woman," she said.
"Where is my man? "
"It's not worth it," she said.
And I'm beginning to think that she was...
Oh...
Oh, you.
And you.
Cim.
Congratulations, Mother.
Oh, Ruby, darling.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Oh, my boy.
I'm afraid two of your honored guests are just a little sleepy.
- You brought the children too?
- Yes.
- Where are they?
- Over there.
Come with me. Come on.
Oh, Arita.
Oh, Arita.
Well...
Hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Mother.
Oh, do you remember when I told you to stick with it?
Do you remember that day when I told you?
Oh, she wanted to give up, and I told her,
"You stick with it, little lady. "
- And she stuck.
- Oh, you.
And she's made something.
- You said-
- No, no.
Speech. Speech.
- Speech.
- Speech.
- Speech.
- Oh, Tom, you make a speech.
- You are a much better speaker than I am.
- Speech, speech.
Speech.
Well, I feel-
I'm afraid
I feel like a fraud standing here.
If it hadn't been for so many people like Mrs. Pegler...
...there wouldn't have been an Oklahoma Wigwam at all.
And Jessie, who got us started.
And Sol, who kept us going...
...through all the mean and ugly years, both spiritually and financially.
Oh, yes.
And, uh, most of all... You were looking for the spirit of the pioneer.
Well, his spirit is here tonight.
God only knows where his ornery self is.
And you all know who I mean.
It's easy enough to drudge along and cling on to something...
...what somebody else has created.
And that's all I've done.
Just to survive.
But the leaders, the true pioneers...
...they are rare and hard to come by.
Sometimes even harder to understand.
And almost never appreciated until it's too late.
But such a man was my husband.
No, I don't mean "was," I mean "is. "
Because every time
I hear a sudden noise...
...or see an unexpected shadow,
I hold my breath...
...waiting for my Yancey to burst in on me and pick me up...
...and pick up the conversation exactly where he left it 10 years ago.
Well, I hope he still can pick me up, the weight I've put on.
Oh, my God.
My darling Sabra.
I can just hear you now, accusing me of chasing excitement again...
...but I feel sure America is bound to get into this thing, sooner or later...
...and I had to get into it as soon as I could, and don't ask me why.
I guess somebody's got to.
For 11 years,
I've been trying to write this letter to you.
And when I think of all the things you've given me and how little I've given you...
...how does a man say to a woman he loves:
"I apologize for loving you "?
We've just gotta be patient with each other, that's all.
Yes.
I just love you so much.
- What if he's a girl baby?
- A girl?
Yancey would send her right back.
Oh, I'll bet he would.
He's part of the history, a man like that.
We'll be proud of him.
Round and around and around and around.
Listen, I need you far more than you need me.
You helped me. You helped me.
Yancey.
Damn you, Will Penny!
Steal my biscuits and bring me no firewood!
What the hell's got into you?
Them biscuits ain't for you to steal.
They ain't to be ate till I say so.
Now, come on, give 'em back.
At least give me some coffee.
Bring me some firewood.
Go on. Pot ain't boiled yet anyhow.
Chuck! Come and get it, you cow-nurses, or I'll throw it out!
- Chuck's on!
- Come on out, boys.
Get outta those blankets, damn you!
- Wearing snowshoes, Bo?
- You've been walkin' on my feet.
Old man like you belongs at the end of the line. We do all the work.
I'm surprised you got this far.
You earned yourself a warm corner.
That's enough, Shorthorn.
Was you about to do something?
'Cause I'd sure clean your plough.
- Whoa!
- Ride him!
You stupid, jug-head bastard!
Last day. Make it a good one.
Get there today and you make your bonus.
Get where? Ain't a bottle of whisky or a town inside a week of here.
Save your money!
Get a spread of your own, like me.
- Money didn't get you into cattle.
- No? What did, Will?
More like a long rope and a hot iron.
Let's go!
Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it, old man.
It's time you did something, Will.
Fightin' don't get the work done.
- Something chasing you, Dutchy?
- If the augur sees you, he'll get mad.
Ja. I see where they're taking us.
Nowhere, that's where.
Nowhere at all!
Who figures it out they put a spur there? What for?
Everybody trying to get ahead.
Train company wants to get to the cows.
Anse wants to get to market first, to get top price.
And the poor cow-hand rides drag.
- Better than pushin' a plough.
- Ja.
Down steer!
Bigfoot! Comin' a-runnin'!
He busted my damn leg!
- Gimme some air, boys.
- Stand back, boys.
She's busted, all right.
Grab a hold of this.
- Here.
- You've been holding out on us.
That stuff's for doctoring, not drinking.
Hang on to him.
That's enough.
- Feels like it's smashed to pieces.
- He'll go to Kansas City with us.
He'll get a doctor there and his train ticket home.
What if he can't work for you no more, Anse?
That's the fall of the cards.
He'll get a job some place.
Ike, how did you manage that?
Real slop. But that's the way I like it.
You do the cooking.
I'll get a job where the horse has the brains and does all the work.
Well, look who's here.
Where you been hidin', Grandpa?
Might not be good, but it's hot!
- You ain't fightin' proper!
- You're the one that's down.
I told you that leaky mouth would jump up on you, Boetius!
- Won't you fight with these?
- My hands are for working.
If the Lord wanted men to fight like dogs,
He'd've give 'em teeth and claws.
He's younger than you figure, ain't it, sonny?
You go to your gun,
I'll hang you right here!
- You boys wanna fight, or get paid?
- Get paid!
- If you can't write, make your mark.
- I went to four grades of school!
- Want your train ticket?
- Don't need it. Got my wagon.
Move on. Let the next man in.
You can't cowboy as good as you write.
Ticket?
No ticket for me.
I think I ride along with Blue.
- What's your whole name, Will?
- Penny. Will Penny.
- You got any family?
- No.
Another job to go to?
This time of year?
You know better than that.
You're a good steady hand.
You can be bull-nurse with me.
Wait here for the train and ride to Kansas City.
Sure thing.
Mr Howard. Can I go with you to Kansas City?
- You wanna see the elephant?
- Naw, hell. I've been there before.
My pa lives there.
He's gettin' pretty old.
If I don't see him on this trip,
I won't see him again at all.
I already got Will Penny.
If you wanna go, you've got more than enough to get there.
Well, you're a fair man, Mr Howard.
I'll see you punchers some time.
- Ever been to K.C.?
- No. I guess I'll see the elephant.
Ja!
Wiedersehen, Will.
- Will. I gotta talk with you.
- Sure.
It's about my pa.
- So long, Anse.
- So long, Bo.
Damn haul gets longer every year.
See you back in cactus country.
I don't know, Bigfoot.
It puts me out of a job mighty sudden.
- North of here, Flatiron might be hiring.
- In the winter?
I wouldn't lie to you, honest.
Hold on... Look...
I'll give you some of my pay.
Twenty dollars!
Which one of you is coming with me?
Aw hell, go on, then.
Gimme ten dollars so I don't feel like a damn fool.
- Me, Mr Howard, if it's OK.
- Come on.
- Much obliged, Will.
- Yeah.
You fellas got room for one more hand?
So long, boys!
So long, boys!
Hey, Blue. Come on, wake up.
I bet there's some place in this wilderness they got whisky.
- And beds.
- I forgot what it tastes like.
And a bath. I think I got bugs.
Just one shot.
I hope we can find us a job.
Not the three of us together. Ain't no place they hire three hands in winter.
One job's all I need.
Sharing a blanket don't make us married.
Will, I think he'll find that Flatiron spread to hire on.
It's a damned good thing he can cowboy,
'cause he sure can't navigate.
It ain't hot yet.
Come on! Go and get the water!
All right.
- What the hell...?
- It's an elk! Fresh meat!
Hey! Good shot, Blue. You got him.
- But I didn't. Didn't you?
- Didn't I...?
Ja. I shot him with my knife.
- Let's move him.
- Or somebody gonna be mad.
Madder than a stud at gelding time.
Careful. They got the sun on us.
Rawhiders.
Ja. It's bad business.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Name's Quint. Preacher Quint.
These here are my boys.
Mighty nice of you mindin' that elk for us.
We can clean it up ourselves.
Rafe, here, handles a knife just fine.
We give them the elk, ja?
We were onto it first.
Next thing, they'll want our breeches.
Come on, Papa. Let's kill 'em.
We seen a whole camp back there.
Where's the rest of the party?
My shot brought it down.
- Maybe we split 'im up with you.
- Shut up, Dutchy.
Well, now. That's better.
There's five of us.
Countin' my woman.
However many there is of you, if you was only two, that elk might be enough to go round.
We'll work it out that way.
Then we all go away friends, ja?
There's more of us. But we'll make do.
I don't see no more of you.
Maybe you're saying that to trick us.
Or maybe you're saying that because you know that elk is ours.
And you're scared because the Lord don't side with them that lies and steals.
The Lord sides with the righteous.
If you go away, maybe the Lord will go easy and forget you tried to rob folk of what's theirs.
Walk away in peace.
- We leave them the damn elk!
- If they let us.
They killed Romulus!
Beware the wrath of the Lord!
He strikes down them that have blood on their hands.
He punisheth the sinner.
Life for life.
Eye for eye.
Tooth for tooth.
Burnin' for burnin'.
Wound for wound.
Stripe for stripe.
Who sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.
You ain't seen the last of me!
Blue!
- Dutchy, what's wrong?
- I'm shot.
I think maybe I done it to myself.
I couldn't get the gun out of my pocket.
Don't you move. We'll get the wagon.
Blue!
- Don't forget the elk.
- Yeah.
Hey! Pig, pig, pig...
Is there a doctor nearby?
A man's hurt.
- Come in. Maybe I can help.
- No, thank you.
Isn't there a damn doctor close?
About a half day's fast ride up the road.
Town of... Alfred.
If you're bad enough to see a doctor, time you get there it's too late anyway.
- How bad's your friend hurt?
- Bad. He's gut-shot.
Belly-shot out here?
He's a dead man for certain.
He'll bleed to hell before he gets to Alfred.
Hello. Name's Catron. Place is mine.
Got some good whisky inside.
Best to make him rest easy while he waits for the end.
Anything he drinks, on the house.
Bury him out back.
I'll carve him a nice head-marker.
Twenty-five dollars sound about right?
You sound almighty sure he's gonna die.
Sure, I'm sure. Best to face these things so you can make plans.
Dutchy? How are you makin' out?
Oh, Will... It hurts like hell.
- We'll go on.
- Hey, Will...
Maybe he's right, what he said... that I die before we get there.
No, hell...
We have waited a long time for a drink of whisky, ja?
Here is the last place before that town, and...
...you know, maybe I'll never get there.
Will... l'd like to have a sure drink here.
Better than a maybe drink later on.
It couldn't hurt so much, one drink.
Come on!
Yes, sir! Planning means a man don't get any unhappy surprises.
Take your friend. You know, and he knows, he's gonna die.
You don't have to fight over his goods.
Take that coat, for a coat like that,
I'd give a man five, six dollars.
- You...!
- Will!
Give us a bottle and three glasses.
Can you pay?
You got more guts than a man could hang on a fence.
We can pay.
How's she taste?
Damned if I know.
But it sure burns a dollar's worth.
Good, ain't it?
Ma!
- Ma!
- HG, don't shout. I can hear you.
There's a man, he's hurt.
He's lying there in a wagon.
- Is he alive?
- Sure is.
He's cussing something awful, some words I never even heard before.
You have to get to a doctor, immediately.
Too late for a doctor. No...
...l'm just a dying cowboy.
Well... There must be something I can do.
Lf, maybe, you could...
...hold my hand?
- Of course.
- You're an angel, lady.
- Tell me, how did it happen?
Wild Indians they was, lady.
Maybe... fifty.
My friends ran away and left me to fight them off.
Why, the cowards! That's terrible!
Ja, that's right. Them bummers.
They wait until them Indians is all finished, then they come back, and bring me here.
Here you go, Dutchy.
Thanks, Will.
Least I can do after you killed all them Indians.
Are you one of the men, his friends, who left him to the savages?
- We surely did.
- You call yourself a man?
You call yourself his friend and then you do this to him.
If I were you, I'd never speak...
I would never speak to them again.
Ja. Maybe I won't.
I cannot comprehend behaviour like yours, I simply can't.
It's easy to figure, ma'am.
We just ain't as brave as him.
Dutchy's... plumb brave.
Yes. And you leave him to die in the cold.
At least bring him inside.
That won't help him, juggling that bullet around in his innards.
Is that going to help him?
It may not put him back on his feet but it won't put him in his grave either.
Is there anything more I can do to help you?
No.
Hey, Will.
What he said, that... Schwein...
...is he right, do you think?
- I will die?
- It happens to all of us, Dutchy.
No, Will. You know what I mean.
Is now my time?
We'll get you to that doctor.
I don't know, Dutchy.
How the hell do I know?
There's a lot I ain't done yet.
Cowboyin' around.
Hurts like hell.
- I'll get you another drink.
- Will?
I'm only 27 years old.
- Want part of the bet?
- What bet?
He bet 50 dollars Dutchy don't make it to... Where's it?
- Alfred.
- Want some of that?
- All you got.
- Another 50!
- You got a bet.
- Let's drink on it, like gentlemen.
How do you know what gentlemen do?
Mr Bodine.
Mr Bodine, you promised to get us to California before winter set in.
- That's what my husband paid you for.
- Yes, ma'am. He sure did.
As soon as you finish that plate, we're leaving. Is that clear?
Yes, ma'am.
Let's have another bottle.
One of them St Louis ones.
- Mr Bodine!
- That'll be three dollars, ma'am.
Hurry up, HG.
Get your stockings.
Hold on.
- What do you think, Will?
- About what?
About Dutchy.
- You known him a long time?
- No.
- Why did you bet?
- Why did you?
We been working the same outfits, three, four years running.
He's a good old boy.
And this ain't a good way for him to go.
I'll tell you Blue, there ain't no good way to go.
Let's drink up and get outta here.
- Sonny?
- Yes, sir?
- Where's the doctor?
- Doctor?
- They said you got a doctor here.
- Down the street. The barber's shop.
Where it says "Post Office".
Doctor? There's a man hurt out here.
How about it? He's bad shot.
Shot, hell.
He's damn near frozen to death.
He smells like a still.
Did you stop off on the way to celebrate?
Slow and easy. If you move too fast, they might miss something.
Over there on the couch.
Better go home, John. I'll finish you later.
If I want any help, I'll send for you.
You can go home now.
Mattie! I'll need you.
You must have taken your own sweet time getting here.
This is my wife, Mrs Fraker.
I don't know their names.
If we straighten him out too fast, he'll break, he's that cold.
Let's warm him up, and then get his clothes off.
Why don't you boys go to the hotel, get yourselves a bath?
Come back tomorrow morning.
Children. Dangerous children.
- But it's so early!
- Early, hell. The sun's up.
Oh. The sun's up.
Go along, now. I'll see you again.
Not if I see you first.
Will, are you really that set on going?
I'd not care to winter here.
The way money goes,
I'd be sellin' my saddle.
But ridin' the grub line up here?
There's that Flatiron spread
Bigfoot spoke about.
If that don't work out,
I guess I'll head south. You?
I reckon I'll just hang around a spell.
Maybe get a job bar-doggin'.
See how old Dutchy makes out.
Maybe we'll cut trails some day, south of here.
Maybe so, Will.
Yeah. That's him, all right.
Ain't no way to forget him.
Not while he's alive, anyway.
- We sure as hell can fix that in a hurry.
- Not yet.
Plenty of time.
He ain't going nowhere we can't find him.
And we're just gonna take our own good time about it.
About carvin' him up.
You make 'im out, Alex?
- Somebody ridin' grub line, I suppose.
- That's a Flatiron horse.
- Ain't that Bright Eyes?
- Yeah, one of old Claude's string.
- Want to talk about this?
- I found him like that.
I guess he came off and wrapped up the whole ball of wax, right there.
- Old Claude was a good horsebacker.
- Pretty forky.
If you say so. I never had the pleasure.
What brings you up here?
- Are you the stud duck?
- That's right.
I just shoved a bunch from Texas, put 'em on the train...
...and went off the payroll.
- You're looking for a meal?
No, I'm looking for a job. One of the
Texas hands said you might be hirin'.
I'll take 'im.
He ain't comin'. I come instead.
- You must need a hand.
- Claude was a good cow-puncher.
- Mighty good man all the way round.
- Well, sure.
- That's always the way.
- What's always the way?
Let a man die, right away he's good old Claude.
How was he before he bucked out?
You boys, go dig a proper grave.
We'll hold services for him later.
Come on over to the bunkhouse.
This here gentleman calls himself Will Penny.
He comes ridin' around here as nice as you please, hopin' to find a nice job.
And there lays old Claude, just beggin' him:
"Take mine, Mr Penny, take mine!"
Hell, that's the story you give the big augur.
Now, we're just no-account cow-punchers together, here.
Ain't no need for you to tell us them lies.
Well, son. You dealt this hand.
I guess you'll just have to play it out.
Hold it! All of you.
This man's on the payroll.
A Flatiron hand, not a stranger.
Any eyeballing done around here, I'll do it.
- Hell, we're just trying to help 'im.
- Yeah, like a sharp stick in the eye.
Take Claude's job, line-rider in the ridge country.
Pay's 30 dollars a month.
Are you sure you rode line before?
Sure enough to have mighty strong feelings about it.
You can tell he's done it before.
We got rules here on the Flatiron.
You hold to 'em and we'll be friends.
Break 'em and you're out before you can say, "Excuse me, ma'am."
First, we got no drinkin' or gamblin'.
Cut the wolf loose all you want in town, but not on this layout.
- Is that plain?
- Plain enough.
The pilgrims that come through:
As long as they keep movin', fine.
If they take a beef now and then, you don't do much either.
But you don't let nobody stop.
That's the most important thing.
Nobody stops on Flatiron range.
- What if they don't move?
- They'll move all right.
Won't nobody say nothing about it, neither.
One of the boys'll tell you how to get to the old shack.
Three or four days' ride.
Is there anything else?
No. I reckon you said it all.
About them nesters. If there's too many to handle, come back for help.
Otherwise, I don't wanna hear from you till spring.
Hello, the shack!
You may as well come on out.
This here's Flatiron range.
You can't squat here.
Don't... don't shoot!
Please! Don't shoot.
My name's Will Penny.
You remember me, ma'am, from the...
...road ranch, that man Catron's place?
- Don't come nearer! I'm alone and...
- Ma!
The boy's right. Don't ever tell a stranger out here you're alone.
- Where's your guide, Mr Bodine?
- He went on ahead.
- Did he get paid?
- My husband paid him in St Louis.
He ain't comin' back,
I can promise you that.
Anybody could see he had no stomach for it.
Now look at you.
You and the button, you can't sleep in the wagon.
Well, of course we won't.
- You can't stay here.
- Why?
This is Flatiron range.
The rules say no squatters.
If you won't move on peaceable, somebody will come and make you.
Are you gonna do that?
If I don't, they'll just send some...
That's how it is up here.
Nobody's using this old shack, anyway.
A line-rider uses it, son.
Look, there ain't no way...
Don't come any nearer. This may go off.
Please, don't be scared.
I ain't gonna hurt you none.
Look, I'll be on my way.
Please be careful with that damned thing, ma'am.
I'll be gone two, three days, maybe a week.
I gotta see how this place lays out.
That gives you plenty of time to pack up.
When I get back, you be gone from the line-rider's shack.
Mr Penny!
Who is the line-rider?
Me. I am.
- We'll have to get more tomorrow.
- Already?
You want to be warm,
'specially in the morning.
You goin' somewheres, boy?
He ain't as stout as he looks.
Aw, hell!
Just stand right there...
- Gimme my knife back.
- Get his boots.
Boots hell, Papa.
We're gonna get everything here.
Come on down!
Papa!
He ain't dead yet.
Ain't we gonna get to kill him?
Oh... that's bad.
That is bleedin' real bad.
We don't want that to happen.
I knew a fella once, his wagon team got away with him, run a wheel spoke through his middle.
Bled himself out, right there.
Don't you know how easy it was?
It was like takin' a little sleep under a shady tree. Didn't hurt at all.
He just got kinda drowsy and...
...just dozed off. Well...
...sir, it ain't gonna be that easy for you.
No, sir. Not that easy.
Remember me?
- Dead?
- No, he ain't dead. Leave him.
Leave him?
Leave him be. Out here by himself...
...no goods...
...winter comin' on.
He's gonna be a long while a-dyin'.
And all that time, he's gonna know who done it to him.
Yes, sir. Mighty long time.
And then, he'll be dead.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
Blessed be the name of the Lord.
Come on!
- Ma.
- Yes?
- Is he gonna die?
- Well, I hope not.
HG! Go and get some water!
HG!
Yes, Horace?
I thought we didn't like him.
We don't.
I just couldn't let him stay sick.
It wouldn't be...
It wouldn't be Christian, would it?
Like the good Samaritan.
That's right.
I think you should eat something.
It's been three days.
That long?
Here.
Good...
Thanks, I... I owe you thanks.
Let's be clearer. We are not friends.
You can stay until you're better, but when you are, you will, of course, leave.
Poor old cow's freezing out there.
You awake, mister?
Not really sure.
Was it the Indians? The wild Indians?
How many were there?
Hundred, maybe two hundred.
A hundred? You're telling a fib.
That's right, Button. Just a windy.
HG, I think Mr Penny would like to get some rest now.
Mr Penny!
Before long it'll burn so fast, I won't be able to chop enough even two-handed!
We worked to make you better.
You could hurt yourself doing something unnecessary.
Unnecessary!
I don't wanna scare nobody, but it's gonna be hell here before winter's through.
Working eight days a week, we won't be able to get ready for it.
Most of this wood's so damn green.
What are we gonna do?
Winter's just hardly started.
Burn chips, I guess.
What's chips?
Cow chips, buffalo chips. They make a hot fire, burn slow. You know.
No, I don't know. What's chips?
Well, chips are...
Well, they're...
They're just dried up...
Yeah?
Aw, hell.
I'll get the button and go find some. Horace!
Is it true what Ma says, you'll chase us away?
Look, Button, there's more to it than just sittin' there.
Sit up straight, hang on with your legs.
If they find out about you and your ma down at the Flatiron...
If you told 'em, would there be shootin'?
- Might be.
- Maybe you oughta tell 'em.
- You want to see some shootin'?
- Never seen any.
I don't think you'd like it much.
How many people have you shot?
Don't think that's anything to brag on to a nice boy like you.
Come on, sit down and rest a spell.
I ain't so nice. You can tell me.
Well, I guess there was a few times.
- How did it feel?
- Bad.
Bad scared before, bad sorry after.
Ever shoot a red Indian?
Yeah, once.
Didn't like that much neither.
How come Indians are all red and sunburned?
That ain't sunburn. They come that way.
- Indians don't get sunburn much.
- How come?
They're smart. You've seen them sunflowers that grow in the spring?
- Yeah.
- Indians take the seeds, grind them up into a butter and spread it over themselves to keep the sun out.
- Aw, no!
- Straight up truth.
- They make do with what nature gives.
- How do you know all this?
Even a blind hog roots up an acorn now and then.
Will you keep telling me all these things you know?
Why, sure, Button.
I'll have you a regular scout in no time at all. Come on.
Come on, boy.
"Here comes the band.
Shall we call Mama and Sandy to see it?
"Let us stand still and hear the men play as they pass.
"I hope they will stop here and play for us.
"See the large man in front of the band, with his big hat.
"What has he in his hand?"
Cold on the outside and warm on the inside.
That's the way I hope it works.
I'm almost finished, Ma.
Why not finish tomorrow?
And then tell me what you've read.
How much has gone from here... to here...
Right now, jump into bed.
- Aw, Ma!
- Hurry up.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Night, Will.
- Goodnight, Button.
He reads real good.
That oughta do her.
When the snow comes hard, she'll seal up even tighter.
You seem well recovered, Mr Penny.
Feelin' real good now.
I'm glad.
- Mr Penny... It's time for a bath.
- Bath!
Yes, Mr Penny.
- A bath.
- What for? I took a bath.
- When?
- Well, back there in Alfred.
At that hotel. It was real hot, too.
That seems like a long time ago.
It's about time for another.
So soon?
- Mr Penny. How often do you bathe?
- What? What?
I said, how often do you bathe?
Eight or nine times, it... depends.
- On what?
- On the weather.
Eight or nine times a month?
Eight or nine times a month? A year!
- A year?
- Well, sure.
You have a real good one when you finish the shove up north, like at the hotel in Alfred, then one or two in the winter.
Hope you don't catch your death.
And a couple in the spring.
And one more good one before you start the shove up again.
The rest depends on what kind of water you hit on the drive.
What's wrong with that?
That's as much as anybody.
Not quite anybody, Mr Penny.
Now, I think that'll do.
That's hot.
Those clothes could use a wash.
May I have them, please?
What am I gonna wear till they're dry?
I have some of my husband's.
You could give them to me in here.
What are you fixin' to do in Oregon?
Farm. We're farmers, Mr Penny.
I hear that's mighty good cow country.
We're not cowboys, we're farmers.
Good thing, too, I reckon.
What's that supposed to mean?
Them horses you got, neither one's good for much except ridin' to church.
Jim is a perfectly good horse, and so is Daisy.
Neither one has kicked or bucked since the day we got them.
I surely believe that.
Plain truth is, I'm gonna have hell if I don't get a decent cow horse.
- Well, get one.
- Where?
At Flatiron, Alex'll ask what happened to the string he gave me.
Well, tell him! It wasn't your fault.
I know that, Mrs Allen.
Well, then?
He's gonna have every hand in the place out lookin' for them rawhiders.
I hope they do, Mr Penny.
You hope they do?
Well, ma'am, you don't know nothin'.
First thing, they'll be here lookin' for them horses. Then what?
Oh, I see.
Does that mean that you won't tell them about Horace and me?
No, I ain't gonna tell 'em.
What?
No, I ain't gonna tell 'em!
It's plain you'll be staying.
Cold weather like this, I miss it some.
You come all the way from Ohio alone?
Yes...
No. With HG and... Mr Bodine.
From St Louis with him.
You're... going on?
In the spring.
Alone.
Unless I find someone to show us the way, a guide or a...
...wagon train.
Might be your husband'll come back lookin' for you.
No, he won't do that.
If I was him, that's what I'd do.
Well, you see, you're not.
I hope he doesn't.
He went ahead to start things for us, and if he came back for us, it would just...
...be a waste.
I mean, it would all be a waste.
It wouldn't be very practical.
I don't know about that.
But this is hard country. Double hard.
I hate it.
You couldn't turn around, go on back home?
No, I don't think I'd like that either.
Looks like you're caught between the sap and the bark.
Was it such a bad place, that town?
We don't all have the same choices.
We just don't all have the same choices.
We did what we thought was right.
- Seems a long way to go for wood.
- Yep, reckon it is.
Looks about right.
Here, Button, you cut it.
Right there where I marked it.
Is it really almost Christmas?
- Pretty near.
- It's beautiful.
I chopped it down, all by myself.
Didn't I, Will?
He did it all.
Tonight, I'll make some things to hang on it.
- Ma?
- Yes.
Next Christmas, will we be home?
Yes, Horace.
Next Christmas, we'll be home.
Sure glad no one's seen me do that.
Be laughed off the place.
What? Milking?
No self-respectin' cow-hand would be caught milkin' a cow.
- I won't tell anyone.
- I sure won't go braggin' on it none.
O Tannenbaum

You remembered!
All the words Grandpa taught you.
Very nice. Let's all sing it, in English.
Oh Christmas tree
Oh Christmas tree...
- I don't know them words.
- But everybody knows that one.
- Not me.
- Don't you know any Christmas carols?
I guess not.
We'll teach him one, that'll be our Christmas present.
Only, that'll be for tomorrow.
It's time to go to bed. Goodnight.
Night, Will.
- Goodnight, Button.
- Goodnight.
Is it really almost Christmas?
- Yes, Horace.
- Is it, Will?
- Sure enough, boy.
- Night.
We can never repay you.
You've done so much to help us.
Ain't nobody keepin' books on it.
- Looks like you're due a singing lesson.
- Looks like.
- Is that so funny?
- You won't think so when you hear me.
You'll be fine with HG as a teacher.
He likes you.
Goes both ways.
He's picked himself a mean chore, though.
Let me do that for you.
- The sooner we start, the better.
- What?
I'll sing a line and you follow.
Deck the halls with boughs of holly...
Oh, come on! For HG.
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Very good!
Fa la la la la, la la la la...
Fa la la...
- It's plumb silly!
- Let's do the two of them together.
Deck the halls with boughs of holly
Fa la la la la, la la la la...
'Tis the season to be jolly
Fa la la la la, la la la la...
Maybe you was right at the start of it.
Be better if I'd bed down somewheres else.
- I think that you misjudge.
- No, I was talking about me.
So am I. I think you misjudge yourself.
No. I ain't no better than the rest of 'em.
You don't know what it's like out here, one woman for every 20, 30 men, and she ain't likely to be much for looks or temper.
Someone like you... you don't know.
Lookin' the way you do, just...
...goin' about your business, not talkin' all the time like some...
That smile, in your voice, when you got somethin' to say.
No, please... No.
You do know that, do you?
You know.
I suppose I do.
I tell you I've had... some kind of hell these last weeks.
Pure hell.
I'm sorry.
No. No need for you to be.
I've been alone since I was a button like him.
No family to speak of, just...
...helpin' in saloons, livin' with this one, that one, free and easy...
I never wanted it no other way, never knew no other way...
...thought that's how it's supposed to be.
Now, here you are... You and him...
You ain't even mine!
You got a way of makin' a man feel like he's a man.
Reckon it's just a case of too soon old and too late smart.
Stay, Will!
Merry Christmas!
So. After all that time, you still ain't dead.
That's good. You got yourself fixed up real nice around here.
Yes, sir. Real nice.
Ma!
Boy! Come on!
- Boy, tell me. Is this your pa?
- No!
- Your husband? Is he your husband?
- No... Yes!
Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth.
Ask quick and the lies come out second.
- What you gonna do?
- What we gonna do?
We gonna stay here and we gonna rest from our labours.
But no work, see. No work because this strong man is gonna do it all for us.
A hired hand, all our own.
Never figured on that, did you?
Our own hired hand.
- Wait, please!
- Now, woman, look!
Which one of my tall sons are you gonna take up with?
It's a hard choice, I agree.
Both fine, upstanding young men,
- righteous in the eyes of the Lord.
- Amen!
So which one? He ain't your husband and you took up with him.
She never took up with me.
So, you can take up with one of my boys. Make a choice.
I can't... I...
Yeah?
- I need time. It's a hard choice.
- Of course it's hard.
I'll give you two days. That's fair.
Now all their fine points:
Rafe is smarter but he's meaner.
Ruf's stronger but he's dumber.
If the Lord had put them together, they'd be a perfect man!
Take your pick.
Come out before you make trouble!
Get back with the woman and the boy.
- Wait!
- Come on, boy!
Now then, you! Wake him up.
You! We're gonna keep you here, and we're just gonna keep workin' your butt off.
And if you misbehave,
I'm gonna let Rafe there skin you.
And I mean skin, sonny.
He skinned a fella once down in Texas.
A mighty fine job, too.
What the hell?
Go back to sleep.
Are you all right?
Yes.
I don't know. Some way,
I gotta get back to Flatiron.
- They'll kill you.
- I got a plan.
Ain't gonna be no party, you'd have to deal with 'em.
Will... You know what they want from me tomorrow.
I'll do anything. Anything.
Not now! I have to make supper.
- When?
- In the morning, in there.
In the morning, in there?
Just you and me?
Just you and me.
- When?
- Everybody will be busy in the morning.
In the morning? Where?
The lean-to. In the morning.
In the morning, in the lean-to.
I'm gonna be there.
I can dance any one o' ya down to your knees.
If you don't believe me, gimme a try.
Hey, boy, get your mouth off her!
Did you forget what you told me?
- What...?
- What's the matter?
- Who asked you to come in here?
- You wanna know?
She did. That's who.
You're lyin'. She didn't say that to you, she told me to come here.
I asked both of you. I wanted to see who would be the better man.
And she made her decision, see?
You've been telling me a lie, girl.
There's a woman and a boy in the cabin.
Trouble runs to you like a calf to its mama.
Blue! What the...
You sure forget your friends in a hurry.
Thought you were from the Flatiron.
So glad to see you, I never looked.
Lord was smilin' down when he put you here.
- Lord nothin', we come lookin' for you.
- We?
- Dutchy!
- Ja. It's me, all right.
- Doctor in Alfred said we saved his life.
- How?
Leavin' him in the wagon.
It was so cold, his blood wouldn't run.
If we'd kept him warm, he'd have bled right out.
What the hell happened over there?
I need some help. Bad.
How'd you like to get us down in this wagon? Close to the shack.
Real close.
Load the gun!
HG!
Get away from there! Get away!
Will!
- Gonna tell me about this, Penny?
- How come you fellas are here?
Your compadres come lookin' for you.
I figured you might be planning something.
Then one of the Lazy Bar Seven hands said we had cattle scattered all over.
We wondered if anybody was takin' care of this camp.
- I can see now why we didn't.
- You got it wrong, Alex.
It'll be all right. Don't worry.
Them rawhiders damn near killed me.
Would have done, if it hadn't been for that lady.
And them?
We come to take him back to that man
Catron, he owes us 50 dollars each.
And them two?
Hell, I couldn't turn 'em out to winter up here alone.
That must have been some comfort.
There's no call for that.
What would you have done in my place?
Took 'em back down to headquarters.
We'd have found work for 'em till spring, or till the wagon train comes.
Maybe you thought of that, too.
Reckon I did.
We'll do that right now, then.
What happened?
Alex has got his back arched up.
Can't blame him.
He's sending you down below.
You coming with us?
You want us to go down and wait, while you work the winter up here?
I ain't stayin' here.
Will we go with you?
Cath...
Shoot, you're still married!
- Pardon?
- You got a husband.
I've never been married, really.
He'd never notice if we never showed up.
Except for the work.
You've been more of a father to Horace than Reuben ever was.
That's not it, though, is it, Will?
Will. What is it?
It's come on so...
...so quick, like.
Will...
Before I married Reuben,
I had two years to think about it.
All that time never helped a bit. Now,
I've got a few minutes and I'm sure.
I'm absolutely sure.
I'm damn near 50 years old!
Yes.
What could we do?
There are lots of homesteads, all over this land.
Will... Before...
...when we talked, what did you think we'd do?
I don't know. I...
I never really come face to face with it, I guess.
Will. Do you love me?
What do I know about love?
Love? I guess you could call it that...
And more.
I never felt like this about nobody.
I want you, and the button, for my own, but...
But?
It takes a heap of time, years, to build up a spread.
I don't have them years no more.
Homestead! We'd just be startin' up with a few measly cows.
Come January, I'd be trying to feed you, the button, the cattle...
- We don't have to ranch! We can farm.
- I don't know nothin' about farmin'.
I do.
Cath, I'm a cow-hand.
Been a cow-hand all my life.
- Scared?
- Damn right. Bad scared.
I told you before,
I lived one way my whole life.
What would I do?
Try to feed you and the boy, on some measly six-cow ranch? What would I do?
Love us?
Hell...
You don't know how bad it can be, ranchin'.
Say I got a frostbit foot, or broke my hand?
Then we're starvin'.
How's love gonna stand up to that?
It's supposed to, isn't it?
Yeah.
Come closer with you than I ever will, with anybody.
I seen what it was meant to be like.
But... it's too late, Cath.
Too late for me.
I ain't a good gamble for you.
I wish luck to you, though.
I surely do that.
I love that boy.
- Pick us up them 50 dollars?
- You bet.
I'm quittin', Alex.
I couldn't work here no more.
Any money I got comin' for my time, give it to Mrs Allen and the boy.
Is he ever comin' back, Ma?
Is he?
Say goodbye, Horace.
Wave goodbye.
Bye, Will.
Bye, Will!
Bye.
Fire.
Aaah.
Bugler, sound recall.
It's over.
It's over.
Corporal Clemens, sir, from Masters'
Brigade at Dante's Crossroads.
Who gave you permission to come ridin' across the face of my command yellin' like a fool?
Have you got a message for me from General Masters?
Yes, sir.
Deliver it.
That's it, sir.
The war is over.
Lee surrendered to General
Grant in Virginia-- a place called
Appomattox Courthouse.
When?
Three days ago, sir.
Three days, huh?
General Masters just got word himself, Colonel Thomas.
Our wires were down.
With your permission, sir.
Rig up a flag of truce,
Blue Boy.
Short Grub?
Yo.
Let's go.
I be a sergeant, sir.
Can I be of any service to y'all?
I'd like to talk to your commanding officer.
Who be givin' orders today, Jim?
Yes, sir?
Major...
I've just received word that Lee surrendered to Grant three days ago.
Yes, sir.
You knew it?
We received the news yesterday.
I don't think you understand,
Major. The war is over.
No, sir.
Are you telling me that you intend to keep fighting?
Haven't we just proven it?
But why?
Because this is our land, and you're on it.
We're all Americans.
Yes, sir. That's always been the saddest part of it.
Good day, sir.
Colonel.
Thank you for your courtesy.
Damn.
Come on.
Captain Anderson.
Here, sir.
General Robert E. Lee surrendered. Am I right?
Yes, sir.
That means that officially we no longer exist as an armed body, yet everywhere I look here today I see armed men... wearing uniforms and flying the battle flag.
Get it down.
Yes, sir.
Jamison.
Yes, sir?
Take down the flag.
Yes, sir.
All right, people, now listen to me, all of you.
We have about 2,000 miles to go.
Seven hundred of them are between here and the Mexican border... and through a Yankee occupation army.
We are not gonna give the lowliest blue belly we meet along the way... any reason to suspect we're anything but a band of homeless pilgrims.
Until we cross the Rio Grande, arms and ammunition will remain in the bottom of the wagons.
You men pack those uniforms away and wear regular clothing.
The poorer looking, the better.
Now, once across the border, we still have another 500 miles to go... before we reach a town called Durango.
There we will be met by representatives of Emperor Maximilian... who will escort us to Mexico City.
Captain Anderson.
Sir?
We leave at midnight.
Yes, sir.

Whoa.
Ah, Mrs. Langdon.
My name is Benedict.
Thad Benedict, late of Pittsburgh, but now of Natchez.
This here's my partner,
Jimmy Collins.
Word's goin' around,
Mrs. Langdon, that you people are of a mind to put your place up for sale.
Is that right?
I beg your pardon, sir, but
I'm the sister-in-law.
I believe you want to speak to Mrs. James Langdon.
Ah, Mrs. James Langdon.
Thad Benedict is my name.
I was just telling your sister-in-law here we heard the place is up for sale.
Is that right?
No, that is not right, Mr. Benedict.
Aw, come on, ladies, we've come all the way from Natchez... just to make you people a handsome offer.
Mind if I get down?
Yes, she does.
And so do I.
My father restin' over there-- he minds too.
Well, well, well, well.
You must be Colonel Langdon.
James Langdon?
Well, uh, Colonel,
I'm here to do you a favor.
Well, let's see now.
Uh... Langdon Hall Plantation.
Ah, yes, here it is.
Fifteen hundred acres.
Is that right?
Six hundred acres bottomland, four hundred in pasture and five hundred in woods.
Two streams, three ponds with a two-and-a-half mile riverfront.
Nice place.
Thank you kindly.
I imagine the house could use a little work, though, huh?
It could stand it.
Yeah. Well, I'll just have a look inside.
We just swept the floor,
Mr. Benedict.
You understand?
I'll give you 50 cents an acre.
That's my top offer.
You buzzards, you come down here lookin' to get fat on the misfortune of others.
This house is not for sale.
Not now, not next year, not ever.
Colonel, we are businessmen.
You're trash.
Well, well. You're a right plain-talkin' gentleman, ain't you?
You hear what the man said, Jimmy? Trash.
All right, who's gonna pick your cotton, and who's gonna plow up all that bottomland out there?
And who's gonna chop the wood when it gets cold?
Now, now, Jimmy. No need to get uppity with the colonel.
Sixty cents an acre.
Take it or leave it.
Just like that, huh?
Just like that.
If I was you,
I'd grab it.
We're gonna get it anyway, you know.
We'll get the house and every last acre of land when they put it up for taxes.
Oh, I see.
And, uh, how do you know it will be put up for taxes, Mr. Benedict?
You went busted outfittin' that rebel regiment of yours.
Now, what do you say?
Sixty cents... or nothin'.
Hyah.
Hyah. Hyah.
This belonged to
Granddaddy Langdon, Horace.
I think maybe he'd want you to have it.
Thank you, sir.
Little George.
Yes, sir?
Bring along that anvil and as many tools as you can carry.
Yes, sir.
Colonel, anybody goin' with us talk that there Mexican?
Why don't you stop lookin' at me?
I can't, Charlotte.
I just can't keep my eyes off you.
Well, you make me uneasy,
Bubba Wilkes, so stop it.
You know, I've asked you a dozen times to marry me, and you've never answered.
I'm too young to marry.
No girl who looks the way you do is too young to marry.
Well, I am. If you don't believe me, you can ask my daddy.
Ask your daddy. Your daddy knows there's no man better suited to marry you--
Charlotte.
Maybe you'd better go on up to the house and help your mother.
You're a good junior officer, Bubba Wilkes.
Thank you, sir.
Don't let anybody tell you you're not.
No, sir.
But as a young man... with a desire for my daughter's hand... you're pitiful.
It embarrasses me to watch you.
I don't understand, sir.
You sure don't.
You let moonlight and magnolia blossoms go to your head, and you forget the real purpose of your mission.
Newby.
Don't tell me
I can't resign, Joe.
I volunteered into this outfit, and I'll volunteer out.
There's still a lot of work to be done.
Not for me, there isn't.
I came into this thing... three years ago with
7 5 volunteers, all good riders.
Do you know how many of those men are left?
No, but I imagine you're going to tell me.
Well, if you'll look out this window, you'll see ten.
Two of them won't make Christmas.
I still can't understand what those men have to do with you resigning.
They didn't join the army, Joe.
They joined me.
For three years
I've watched them fall, and not one of 'em quit and not one of 'em deserted.
Those that are left deserve more than a pat on the back... from some newspaper editor, and
I'm gonna see that they get it.
The army needs horses. Well, there's plenty of horses in the Territory-- wild horses in Arizona and New Mexico-- and we're goin' after them.
And sell them to the army?
We're sure as hell not gonna give 'em to the army.
All right. Write out a letter of resignation, and I'll see that--
You came in mighty handy a few times.
Take care of yourself.
We may need you again, John Henry.
You'll have a hard job finding me, Joe.
Where to, John Henry?
Short Grub, I've been tryin' for three years to get you to call me "Colonel."
Now it's too late.
Where to, John Henry?
West.
The barn's yours, Newby.
Yes, sir.
Good-bye, old lady.
How come you know they're gonna get in here today?
'Cause I told him to be here today, that's why.
Where do you think you're gonna mail that thing, Solomon?
There's a Pony Express, ain't there? Somewhere.
Still a long ways to Oklahoma, John Henry.
Anything could happen.
Not to Blue Boy, it won't.
Come on, tightwad, give me a chew.
Wait a minute, Baker.
I've only got one left.
Come on, give me that.
Hey, that's too big. Come on.
Give me that.
Give me that.
That's my last one.
Come on now, Frank.
I gave you a chew.
All right, I've had it.
Give me that, Frank.
Give me that. Give me that.
Hey. Hey.
Well, I'll be damned.
Lookie yonder.
Hello, Two Toes.
How's your wife?
Pregnant.
What, again?
Cold winter.
How are you, McCartney?
Mister McCartney.
John Henry, the least you can do after I come all this way is say hello.
Hello, Mr. McCartney.
I broke my butt to get here.
You can show me some respect.
Your cookin' still as bad as I remember it?
You go to hell.
You still got that mangy old cat?
High Bred-- finest partner I ever had.
Cleans his paws and buries his leavings.
Lot more than some folks I know.
Any trouble?
No. Lost track of time, though.
I reckon I'm a day early or a day late.
You're four days late, but they don't know it. How are things at home?
Bad, like everywhere else,
I guess.
Yeah. Well, I guess we better get organized.
Don't lose those two over there.
Get 'em all.
Take your time. I'll have
McCartney send you some grub.
That'll be damn nice of you. I hope
I can do the same for you sometime.
Tough way to make a few dollars.
Fighting the damn war was a hell of lot easier than this.
Not too close, Mudlow.
Might be catchin'.
It ain't right, you folks holdin' anger on me... just because I wouldn't join your blamed old army.
Go on, get.
Just mean.Just mean folks.
Charlotte, I'd like to talk to you tonight after supper.
After it's dark, you mean?
All you want to do is hold me and hug me and kiss my lips.
Is there somethin' wrong with that?
Well, a young lady's lookin' for a mite more these days... than huggin' and holdin' and kissin'.
She's lookin' for somethin' a teensy bit more substantial... than periphery and trimmings.
Like what, Charlotte?
I've said all I'm gonna say,
Bubba Wilkes.
Well? Will you walk out with me after supper?
Walk out? Walk out in these dreadful swamps where-- where I could get eaten by a tiger or somethin'?
Oh, you must've lost your foolish mind, Bubba Wilkes.
And it just goes to prove you don't have any true regard for me whatsoever.
A tiger?
The first good grass you come to, give 'em a rest.
All right, John Henry.
We'll be back around sundown.
Hyah.
See'd your dust all day.
What you drivin'? Buffalo?
Stage arrived yet?
It's overdue. I ain't askin'
'cause I don't care.
But if your name's Thomas, there's a couple of popinjays waitin' inside to see you.
They've been here for two days now.
I give 'em water the first day, and they tooken root.
Government agents?
I ain't asked. They ain't said.
Are you the gentlemen that were looking for me?
You are
Monsieur John Henry Thomas?
You have me at a disadvantage.
I am Monsieur Pierre Petain.
This is my companion,
Señor Luis Escudero.
We have the honor to represent the emperor Maximilian of Mexico.
Oh.
Won't you have a chair,
Monsieur Thomas?
Well, thank you, no.
We're waiting for the stage--
We understand you have many horses.
Is that correct, Mr. Thomas?
It could be.
We have been authorized by the emperor to purchase all you can supply.
Well, I'm afraid you gentlemen have made a long trip for nothing.
My horses are going to the United States Army.
But, Mr. Thomas, we'll buy the whole herd, sight unseen.
Top dollar, if you drive them to Mexico.
All expenses paid.
Stagecoach is comin'.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
Our army needs them.
Pardon me.
Whoa. Pedro Flats.
Mr. Thomas?
That's right.
My name is D.J. Giles, and this is my associate, Mr. Ezra Parker.
Howdy. This is Short Grub.
We're out of the U.S. Army purchasing office at Fort Clark, and we understand you have some horses to show us.
No, I have some horses to sell you.
Three thousand, to be exact, and it's the best herd you'll find anywhere.
Fine. Shall we go inside?
Thank you.
We'll cull your herd tomorrow, Mr. Thomas, as soon as our wranglers arrive from Brackettville.
I suppose that out of 3,000 head, we ought to able to find 500 or so that we can use.
Our usual procedure is this--
Just rein up a minute, Mr. Giles.
You're goin' a little fast for me.
Do you mind trottin' through that again?
Not at all. I said that out of 3,000 head, we might be able to find
500 or so that we can use.
You know, animals that meet our specifications.
Well, I have 3,000 for sale, not 500.
Well, surely you don't expect us to purchase... just any old horse for the United States Army?
Well, now there just ain't
"any old horse" in this whole herd.
You'll take 'em all or none.
Mr. Thomas, I'm sure you're aware of the fact... that, uh, times are hard.
Maybe not as hard as you think.
The army's not that hungry for horse flesh.
This country is going through a period of reconstruction.
Money is in short supply.
Hmm?
Who can you sell 'em to if not to us?
Monsieur Petain, hold up a minute there.
Just for the record, what are you payin'?
Twenty-five dollars a head.
Last month it was 35.
But this month it's $25 a head.
Well, these gentlemen have offered to take the whole barrel, sight unseen.
Is that correct?
That's correct, Mr. Thomas.
And what's your top offer?
Thirty-five dollars a head, of course.
You just bought yourself a herd.
And you can tell Maximilian... he won't find better animals between
Montezuma and the Canadian border.
Just a minute.
You're selling horses to Maximilian... in preference to your own country's army?
No, I'm selling horses for $3 5 in preference to 25.
You two figured to make
$1 0 a head.
Are you calling us thieves?
Well, Mr. Parker, yes, that's a pretty accurate description.
Wait a minute.
I didn't do anything.
You should've.
Read that message again,
Sergeant.
"Eighteen rolling units with men, women and children...
"passed through Gladesville,
Texas, 1 0:20 p.m. this date.
"Suspected Confederates.
Probable destination, Mexico.
Detain, search and turn back."
What do you make of that?
It seems I've heard that bird before, sir, at Missionary Ridge.
And if I'm not mistaken, that's a gray-bellied sapsucker.
The river. Come on.
Hyah. Hyah. Hyah.
Get your weapons.
Real sorry, Miss Ann.
We didn't plan things this way.
Let 'em go, Sergeant.
McClarty, Gibbs.
Turn 'em loose. Let 'em go.
Giddap. Hyah.
Sir, I don't mean to--
I know, Sergeant.
But if I can't have the whole dog,
I don't want the tail.
Yes, sir.
We'll probably cross 'em at the old monastery, Eagle Pass.
Bon. Well, if we do not see each other again, then we will rendezvous on the plain at Durango.
Bon courage, Monsieur.
Thank you.
They are fine-looking animals, Mr. Thomas.
The emperor will be pleased.
I hope he is.
But whether he is or whether he isn't, you have the money there when the horses arrive.
What's troubling you?
Cavalry's comin' from Fort Clark.
Damn government agents.
Can they stop us?
Not if we get across that river, they can't.
Let's take 'em to Mexico.
Let's go.
Well, what are you waitin' for?
Stop 'em.
Stop 'em.
We'll be mighty proud to stop 'em,
Mr. Giles-- all 1 2 of us-- just as soon as you tell us how to go about it.
Next.
Mr. McCartney, when are we gonna have some meat?
Right now, if you want it.
Belly cheater.
High Bred, you know what good food is, don't you?
You mangy old cat.
Hey, McCartney.
Mister McCartney.
There's somethin' crawlin' in these beans.
Well, you can speak to it, but don't play with it... or else the others'll want one in their beans too.
Hold that plate.
Yes, sir, I can just feel that money in my pocket right now.
What are you gonna do with it when you get it?
Well, I had to give that a lot of good thought, but I somehow ain't come to set right down on the notion yet.
I know what I'm gonna buy me-- some pack animals and traps.
Whatever's left over,
I'm gonna get drunk.
And if I ever sober up again,
I'm headin' for the Rockies.
Well, that might be fine for you, Whitt, but me bein' better bred,
I got higher ambitions.
Like what?
Like building a small library under a big elm someplace.
Me and High Bred's gonna go to St. Louis and open up a little cathouse.
Everything quiet out there?
Would you believe it, John Henry?
I had to wake two of the men.
Let's hope it stays that way.
You ain't expectin' trouble, are you, John Henry?
Trouble? Well, let's see.
We got Maximilian on one hand... and Juarez on the other and bandits in between.
On top of that, we're Americans in Mexico... taking a cavy of horses to a very unpopular government.
Why should we expect trouble?
How come you didn't tell us that aforehand?
How come you didn't ask me?
John Henry, there's a box canyon about four miles from here.
Enough forage to fill 'em?
No, sir, but there's enough to hold 'em.
There's somethin' else.
I rode across two trails.
One was wagons and horses.
The second trail was many riders-- at least 40 and maybe 60.
The second trail ran just down the side of the first.
Well, if you were to tell me that a year ago... in Virginia or Tennessee,
I'd suspect ambush.
It looked that way to me.
Short Grub.
Yo.
There's forage and water about four miles ahead in a box canyon.
Move 'em in there and hold 'em till we get back.
Where are you going, John Henry?
I don't believe it.
Pick up that bucket.
Well, howdy, Sergeant Newby.
Save your "howdy" for later, Jamison.
Right now let me see you start currying that horse.
Yes, sir.
Just like old times, eh, Newby?
Just like old times,
Colonel.
Riders approachin'
Two riders a-comin'.
Margaret.
We have company.
Good afternoon.
My name's Thomas.
We're drivin' a herd of horses south, just over the hill.
I'm Colonel James Langdon.
Mr. Thomas, what can I do for you?
Well, it isn't what you can do for us.
We came to warn you that you're probably riding into a bandit ambush.
Well, how do you happen to know that?
Well, Blue Boy here is a full-blooded Cherokee.
When he suspects somethin', you usually get it.
There's 40 to 60 riders moving parallel to you, just out of sight.
Waitin' until we get into those hills?
That'd be my guess.
What did you say your name was?
John Henry Thomas.
Don't I know you from somewhere?
To my knowledge, Colonel, we've never met before.
Well, we appreciate the warning, sir.
It's late. Will you and your friend join us for supper, stay the night?
Best offer we've had all day.
There's nothin' like a full stomach... for facin' the unknown future.
Well, I hate to be persistent, Colonel, but, uh, I think the future is pretty certain.
I fully agree.
I think they'll give you a couple of days to get up into the hills before they strike.
If this was my outfit, I'd hold right here and make them come to me.
That's good thinkin'
I've never yet let the enemy choose the sight of his own destruction.
I like to play in my yard.
What are these bandits after?
Gold, horses... women.
We had an experience or two with 'em before the... war.
Were you, perchance, in the war, Mr. Thomas?
Yes, Captain, I was.
Would it be brash and presumptuous of me to ask... which side you were on,
Mr. Thomas?
Well, I favor to think that
I was on the right side, Mrs. Langdon.
I detect a shadow of animosity towards my question.
Could it be that you were a Yankee soldier?
What a question to ask a man.
Yes, ma'am,
I was a Yankee soldier.
Mr. Thomas...
I'm about to make my rounds before I turn in tonight.
Would you care to accompany me?
Thank you, sir.
I suspected it when I saw those
Union trousers on that Indian boy.
My son was killed by Union cavalry at Shiloh, Mr. Thomas.
We called it
Pittsburgh Landing.
You were there then?
I was.
May I ask your rank?
I was a colonel in that cavalry.
John Henry Thomas.
Of course.
Well, you were on
George Custer's right flank... when you charged the breastworks at Madisonville, weren't you?
We did a job that day, didn't we?
You were damn cruel.
Cruel? Those Johnny Rebs had 40-pounders looking right down our throats.
Did you think you were comin' to a ball? Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
If I can find the time, I'm gonna sit down and write the social history of bourbon.
Tell me somethin',
Mr. Thomas.
Were you, by chance, at Chickamauga?
I ask because I lost my brother there-- Ann's husband.
I lost 23 in my command at Chickamauga-- friends and sons of friends, men that I'd known all their lives.
Now can I ask you a question, Colonel?
Fire one, Mr. Thomas.
Why did you come clear out here to continue a war that ended months ago in Virginia?
Because I'm a stubborn man.
Does that satisfy you?
No.
I got no taste for losin' to a lot of Yankee rabble.
How about that?
It won't wash.
You can be a very aggravatin' man, Mr. Thomas.
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Let's just say we haven't seen the end.
You'll see it quick enough if you keep drinkin' this stuff.
Excuse me, Colonel.
Sergeant.
Help yourself.
The young 'uns, now.
Come on over here.
You get over here with me right now.
Hurry, now.
Get tucked away. Come on.
Come on, now.
Mind a suggestion from a
Platte River Indian fighter?
Why don't you arm your women?
That's what we did on the
Bozeman and California trail.
Colonel.
All our night pickets come in yet?
All but Jamison, sir.
Well, go get him.
Carlyle. Little George.
It's Jamison, sir.
All right.
Take him down, George.
Captain, issue a rifle to every woman knows how to use it.
Yes, sir.
Carry on, Sergeant.
Ladies.
Colonel.
Looks like he wants to talk.
We have nothing to talk about.
Well, he's got you outnumbered.
Let's start from there.
Finding ourselves outnumbered,
Colonel Thomas, is a fact of life we've gotten used to.
With women and children in the pot?
I'll go, sir.
No.
The colonel and I will go.
Let's understand each other, Thomas.
Your Indian friend rode out of here last night with no explanation.
He hasn't returned. One false move on your part, and my men won't miss.
Friend, your men have been missin' me for years.
As far as that Indian boy is concerned, his father was Bold Eagle, one of the bravest warriors that ever rode a horse.
And on top of that, he's my adopted son, and I haven't done this much explaining in years.
Don't press me, Captain.
Anderson.
Yes, sir.
Windage and elevation,
Mrs. Langdon. Windage and elevation.
Buenos días, señores.
Yo soy Escalante.
Do you speak English?
Ah, sí.
I speak English most excellently.
Then tell us what you want and be damned quick about it.
We want everything.
We're so poor, and we need so much.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
What do you want?
We want your wagons, your horses, your guns and your gold.
And you also have some women, señor.
Is this fool serious?
You can bet your life on it.
But it's preposterous.
Yeah.
I have more "mens" than you.
If you wanna lose most of 'em, you come right on ahead.
Otherwise, you'd better hightail your ass right on out of here.
I'll fight a thousand of you before I give you a penny.
I was hoping you'd say that.
Is the flap on your holster snapped or unsnapped, my Confederate friend?
Snapped, my Yankee friend.
Well, I guess I'm his pigeon.
Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.
Colonel.
You went out there to talk.
Why did you have to shoot the man?
The conversation kind of dried up, ma'am.
Fire.
Just like old times, huh, Colonel?
Margaret.
Margaret.
 I can't.
Colonel, behind you.
Don't tell me they're leavin'.
No, ma'am.
They're reforming to charge again.
Leastwise, that's their plan.
I'll be damned.
They're leavin' now, ma'am.
That's Blue Boy's little surprise.
Well, I'll be damned.
Mrs. Langdon, the colonel-- your brother-in-law-- said you lost your husband during the war.
Yes, Mrs. Thomas.
I'm sorry.
You didn't know him.
Why should you be sorry?
My cavalry was in that engagement.
Colonel Thomas,
I wanna thank you.
No thanks are necessary. They were our enemies as much as they were yours.
Their own people shoot 'em on sight.
We're in your debt.
Colonel, why don't you take all these people and go on home?
There's no tellin' what you're gonna run into farther south.
In a day or two, we make contact with a military escort from Emperor Maximilian.
We are going home.
It's ahead of us.
All right, Colonel.
Who you wavin' at,
Blue Boy?
Hyah, hyah.
Wanna tell me all about it?
I was thinkin' about that girl.
What girl?
The Confederate colonel's daughter, Charlotte.
She's a pretty girl.
A little young, but pretty.
I want her.
You want her?
And she wants me.
How'd you figure that out?
You raised me to know, John Henry.
I taught you what to do when the snow comes, how to survive in a blizzard, and I taught you how to deal with men, but women--
Nobody knows what's on a woman's mind.
Well, she wants me, and when we go home, she'll be with me.
Anything wrong, John Henry?
Not yet.
Yah, yah, yah, yah.
McCartney, give me a cup of coffee.
Never mind.
I got his coffee.
This damn cinch is pretty near cut in half.
Man's coming, John Henry.
From Colonel Langdon, sir.
I'm to wait for an answer.
We're in a new camp waiting for an escort from Maximilian.
There's a map on the other side.
What's the matter?
Ain't you Yanks ever seen a live one before?
Last time I seen a pretty gray uniform like that, it was all full of holes.
Do you know what's in this, Sergeant?
Of course I know.
There must've been a few words in that camp before the colonel sat down and wrote this out.
Yes, sir. A lot of words I thought
Captain Anderson was gonna have apoplexy.
And how about you personally,
Sergeant. What do you think about it?
Well, it ought to be right interesting.
Anything wrong, John Henry?
You won't believe it, but we've been invited to a Fourth of July party.
We'll be on our best manners today.
Glad you could join us.
Thank you,
Colonel, for inviting us.
First time we've ever been invited to a Confederate shindig.
Well, I'm not surprised, all things considered. Get down.
Thank you.
Get down, all of ya.
Well, we didn't intend to interrupt the festivities.
Well, what are y'all lookin' at? You ever seen a Yankee before? Just people.
Start playin'. Captain.
Sir.
See that Colonel Thomas and his men are taken care of.
Sir, I--
They're our guests, Captain.
Make sure they enjoy themselves.
Yes, sir. Wilkes.
I'm feelin' a little dry, Colonel. Would you care to join me, or don't you indulge?
Where's the sergeant?
I'll risk it.
Follow me.
Thank you.
You Yankee boys hungry? The captain appointed me to tend to you.
There's a mess of beans and ham up yonder, and there's some coffee and grits too.
Grits?
I wouldn't touch 'em.
Why not?
Might be unclean.
Well, it will be a change in cooking.
I'll drink to that.
Make yourself at home.
I'll be right with you.
Thank you.
Mrs. Langdon.
Mr. Thomas.
That's a mighty attractive dress.
French, isn't it?
Yes. I bought it in New Orleans before the war.
Seldom had occasion to wear it since.
You surprise me, Mr. Thomas.
You have knowledge of ladies' fashions?
Well, I was once married, and I have knowledge of the cost of such things.
Here you are, sir. A little sippin' liquor.
Ohh.
Good.
Somewhat finer than what the sergeant provides.
May you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows you're dead.
To your health.
Jimmy.
Excuse me, Colonel Thomas.
Certainly.
Cousin Cora and that Sam-- Well, they're havin' another go-around.
Oh, shoot.
Would you excuse us, please?
Of course.
Colonel, here. Help yourself.
You said that you were once married, Mr. Thomas.
Yes, ma'am.
But lucky for me, she left me.
I must say, Mr. Thomas, that whatever your faults are, you do have a quaint kind of honesty.
Well, she was so busy being a lady that she forgot to be a woman.
It was Indian country, and she didn't like that.
It was cold in the winter, hot in the summer and dusty in the dry spells, and she didn't like that.
And when I wanna go huntin' and fishin', I go huntin' and fishin', and she didn't like that.
And I wanted children, and she didn't like that either.
She didn't like much, did she?
She's happy now, I guess.
She's living in Philadelphia with her cat, givin' piano lessons.
Won't you sit down, Mr. Thomas?
Thank you.
Is that Indian boy really your adopted son?
Yes, but I'm as proud of him as if he were my own blood.

How are you fellas today?
Say, you wouldn't happen to have a little jug of whiskey on you?
They won't give me one. They won't talk to me 'cause I wouldn't join their army.
Well, why wouldn't you join the army?
I didn't wanna get shot.
Sure glad you fellas came over here today though.
I ain't had nobody to talk to in--
Hey.
Yah.

Get him.
Y'all don't have to ask me twice.
Here goes another one.
One, two, three.
Come on, boy.
Any more takers?
You made your point, Bobby Joe. Let it go.
Begging the colonel's pardon.
You know, we got an Arkansas razorback that's just whupped everybody in our outfit.
Well, me and the boys was just wonderin' if maybe you had somebody might could take him.
Are you speaking of the manly art of self-defense, Sergeant?
Yes, sir. I'm here to tell ya.
Root, hog or die-- no holds barred.
John Henry, it wasn't my idea.
Trot him out.
Little George never lost a fight.
Little George?
He'd better have some meat on him.
You sure about this, Bobby Joe?
Trot him out.
Well, go get him, Newby.
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

Bound to.
I sure don't feel much like it.
No. Me neither.
Go get him.
Just one fool thing after another.
Yep. It sure is.
Jimmy, can't you stop this?
Stop what?
It just started.
Thanks, John Henry.
Well, now, I wouldn't call that exactly fair, would you?
No, I wouldn't.
Oh, excuse me, sir. Ooh.
Nice party, John Henry.
Jimmy, this is ridiculous.
It's gone far enough.
Ohh.
Somebody ought to stop them.
Not without takin' a lump, ma'am.
All right then.
Get him, Buster.

Lieutenant Wilkes. Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Wilkes, is this any conduct becoming an officer?
No, sir.
Hey--
Well, now, Colonel Thomas, would you care to make this unanimous?
With pleasure, Colonel Langdon.
Well, now, why'd you want to do a thing like that?
I want this stopped.
I want this stopped now.
Well, that's civilization for you.
Not like Philadelphia.
Huh?
Nothing.
Oh, uh, Colonel,
Sergeant's got a barrel full.
Well, thank you, Colonel.
You've been a perfect host.
I've always heard of Southern hospitality.
Now my men understand what it means.
Well, I thought my men'd do better, Colonel, seein' as how... this is the first time in years we had you Yankees outnumbered.
Y'all come back, hear?
Windage and elevation,
Mrs. Langdon.
Always remember: windage and elevation.
French.
You suppose bandits done it?
Bandits'd have stripped 'em.
More'n likely Juaristas.
I want one man to go back to those Southerners and tell 'em... to forget their escort from Maximilian.
This is it.
I might've known it'd be him.
He's been actin' kind of peculiar lately, John Henry.
Figure he's sick?
Yeah.
Colonel.
There'll be no escort from Maximilian.
John Henry sent me to tell you.
How does he know that?
We ran across them four, five miles south of here.
They're dead.John Henry thinks the Juaristas did it.
I see.
Colonel, you're not gonna believe that, are ya?
Why should I not?
Why would those Yankees bother to send us word of anything?
It just doesn't make sense.
What reason would I have in coming to you with a lie?
Yes, Captain, what reason?
It's late, son.
You may as well stay the night.
Thank you, sir.
Margaret, Ann? Set another place.
This young man's joining us for supper.
Captain Anderson?
 Sir?
Double the night pickets from here on in, Captain.
During the day, I want two men ahead of the column, two men at the rear and two on each flank.
Yes, sir.
Good night, Captain.
Good night, sir.
Corporal?
Yes, sir?
Jimmy, how far are we from Durango?
Three days.
You know, I--I've been thinkin' an awful lot about home.
I have too, Maggie... and my home is you.
Ohh, Jimmy.
I knew it would be nice.
Why'd you ask me how old I am?
Do you care?
No. I'm glad you're young.
It gives us more time to be together.
Oh, I'll always be young if I always feel the way I do now.
When we go back to the Territory, you'll be with me.
Take me now... tonight.
Oh.
You go to bed.
Please, don't hit him.
Stop it.
Hyah.
So Doc says, "Sorry, partner, you're gonna die."
Them "hor-dorv-rees" was mighty fine,
Mr. McCartney, but for my trimmings,
I'd like a Kansas City steak, well done.
You go to hell.
John Henry, you ever hear about that gal in St. Louis? She had the dangedest itch--
Shut up.
We're comin' down to the end of it now. We've lost 500 horses between here and the border, and I don't think that's very funny.
We lose any more, and somebody's gonna be damned uncomfortable.
You know what?
I think John Henry's scared.
How 'bout some coffee?
Kind of worried about him, ain't ya?
Who?
Well, you're the worst liar I ever came across, John Henry. Blue Boy, that's who.
Well, he should've caught up with us three days ago.
You don't reckon he come across bandits, do you?
No, I think he's too smart for that.
You know what I'd be thinkin' if I was you?
I'd be thinkin' he made off with that little Reb gal.
And I'd be thinkin' that he was just about to the Rio Grande by this time.
Well, that's what
I been thinkin'.
Ah, he wouldn't do that.
Nah, he wouldn't do that.
Thanks, Short Grub.
I've changed my mind.
Oh-- Oh.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Well, here they are. You ready for it?
We're all set to make the count.
Good.
Did you encounter any trouble along the way?
Well, nothing to speak of.
Well, we're here, and the horses are here. How about that money?
Oh, it's coming... by special courier with a troop of the emperor's cavalry.
He is most appreciative.
Well, how soon is that special courier due?
Any day. Shall we make the count?
Why not?
2,505 horses.
I am surprised, Mr. Thomas.
How's that?
Well, I thought you would lose more on a long trip like that.
Well, I had an understanding with my men.
I asked 'em not to lose any more, and they didn't.
How long we gonna be here, John Henry?
Till they give us the money.
My men haven't been home for four years.
We're a little anxious.
So we won't be hard to find.
We'll be right handy.
Company, halt.
Left by twos. Ho.
My compliments, sir.
Colonel James Langdon, sir, Confederate States Army.
My aide, Captain Anderson.
General.
My name is Lazaro Rojas.
In the name of Emperor Maximilian,
I welcome you to our pueblo.
We have prepared a welcome banquet for you and your people, Colonel Langdon.
Please, do us the honor... of extending our invitation to those of your party.
Thank you very much, sir. Captain?
Sir.
Lieutenant.
Dismount the troops.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant, dismount your troops.
Prepare to dismount.
Dismount.
Ladies.
Saludas, uh--
Amigas.
Sí, amigas.
Thank you very much, sir.
Salud.
Ah, salud.
It's all right, kids.
It's gonna be all right.
Consider yourselves prisoners of the Revolution.
I shall protest this to Emperor Maximilian, sir.
We take no orders from
Maximilian, Colonel Langdon.
Our president is Don Benito Juarez.
The drums of Mexico beckon us, Colonel.
Please.
James.
Will you excuse us, Mrs. Langdon?
If you think you're gonna scare us with threats, General, you underestimate us.
No, no, Colonel Langdon, we have estimated you very well.
Aside from the men in your party, there are 3 2 women and 1 7 children.
You are friends of Maximilian.
He has brought the French into our country, and they have tried to ride roughshod... over our people.
Now Maximilian has brought you
Southern Americans into our country... because he can no longer get help from Napoleon.
These Frenchmen kill the entire population... of a small village, every man, woman and child... butchered.
¡Atención!
¡Viva. ¡Viva. ¡Viva. ¡Viva.
That is what happens, Colonel, to invaders of my country.
My people are not invaders.
You are here, and you are friends of Maximilian.
But we're not your enemies. What do you want of us, General?
Our forces need horses, Colonel.
Not far from here, there is a herd of 3,000.
Thomas.
Yes.
Thomas.
I'm afraid I don't understand you, General.
You will deliver this to Thomas.
I'll be damned if I will.
I believe you will, Colonel.
Our Revolution needs those horses.
Benito Juarez needs those horses.
I'm a Confederate officer.
You can't expect me to go beggin' those Yankees for anything.
That's in the first place, and the second place, they wouldn't do it.
They have no reason to care what happens to us.
General, that man Thomas would spit in my face.
You will do as I say, or you will all be shot.
I'm not askin' any Yankee for anything.
Very well.
General.
I'll go.
You will have the horses in this place by noon tomorrow... or you will all be shot.
Don't leave me.
Please. Don't ever leave me.
All right. Get up. Get up.
Two Toes has dug up something.
Come on. Get up.
Mr.John Henry?
Yeah?
Uh, we got company.
Thank you, Mr. McCartney.
What's all this?
We found this man.
Found me?
You trapped me, you--
Here, untie him.
I told you that uniform'd get you in trouble.
Yeah.
Mr. McCartney, you got the coffee ready?
All ready.
Good morning.
Bonjour.
Buenos días.
Wake ya up?
Ah.
Get a little coffee in ya and settle down, you can tell us what it's all about.
I was given no choice.
That's why I'm here.
My family, they're all gonna be murdered.
All of my people are in his hands.
When we reached Durango, they-- they gave us a party and then they tricked us.
My people are prisoners of a Juarista general.
I didn't want to come here.
I didn't want to cause you people any--
Aw, damn it. Here.
Read this.
General Rojas is more eloquent than I am.
What does it say,
John Henry?
That's good coffee. Thank you.
You really think so?
Well... it's your game.
How do you wanna play it?
John Henry, we been dealt lots of tough hands since the summer of'61 .
Here's one I wish we could pass.
This don't leave us nothin'.
We ain't never had nothin' nohow.
Wait a minute, Bobby Joe.
You mean you're willin' to give up them horses to them Johnny Rebs?
Well, I ain't no Christian, but my mama was.
John Henry, remember when I lost my horse... up there at Pittsburgh Landing?
Yeah.
There I was without a horse, behind that log and them Rebs was all over me, but there was one didn't have no gun.
Remember me telling you about that one come crawlin' up to me behind that log?
Yeah, but what's that got to do with this?
This Reb, he said he was all tuckered out and he wanted to give himself up.
So I told him to get the hell on outta there. I didn't want him.
You know what he said to me?
No.
"You got me whether you want me or not."
All right.
Looks like you're stuck with us.
John Henry, I--
If we have to get there by noon, we better-- Where's that--
Short Grub, you better throw a couple of outriders in front of the point when we get started.
Yo.
Break camp.
...Durango.
Y Benito Juarez.
Sí.
Muy bien.
Allez.
Crimeny sakes. Those Frenchies have really found some help.
I thought we'd run away from all that.
What about it, John Henry?
Looks like we got ourselves mixed up in somebody else's war.
Yeah, it sure does.
What are we gonna do now?
Well, that's already been decided.
Bring the two chuck wagons up here and fill 'em full of men and rifles.
I'll get 'em.
We'll give 'em a taste of General Sherman's war.
I remember.
They're gettin' a little close, ain't they, John Henry?
Yep.
You ready, Colonel?
Ready.
Break to the sides.
Turn 'em loose, McCartney.
Hang on, High Bred. Get out of my way.
Get up there now. Get up there now.
Short Grub, take care of High Bred for me.
I said a lot of mean words to the boys, ain't I?
You sure have, McCartney.
Mr. McCartney.
Well, you tell 'em
I meant every damn word.
Aah.
You. Two steps forward. Aquí.
You.
You. You.
And you.
You. Grandote.
Aquí..
Mudlow. My turn.
Hands back.
Oh, ho.
You have completed your mission,
Colonel Langdon.
Thank you.
Well, John Henry--
James.
You must be Rojas.
General Rojas.
And you must be
John Henry Thomas.
You drive a hard bargain,
General.
War is war, Colonel.
You should know that.
Yeah, ya... win one... ya lose one.
It is cognac, the only good thing the French have brought to my country.
May I propose that we drink to the health and success... of my President Don Benito Juarez, the Revolution and the future of Mexico.
Hear, hear.
And, General, may I propose a toast to the United States of America.
Not even for 3,000 horses?
To the United States of America... and the Confederacy.
John Henry, what are that
Indian boy's intentions?
Probably disgraceful, Colonel.
But it's not what he'll do to her, it's what she's done to him.
It ain't much like old times, Colonel.
No, it ain't much like old times, Mr. Newby.
What do you plan on doin' once we get back home?
Well, the only place a man can raise more hell than he can in a war... is on the floor of the House of Representatives.
An old friend of mine once told me people like to vote for heroes.
So, I guess that's what I'll do.
That team workin' out all right?
Sure.
You goin' back to the
Oklahoma Territory, Mr. Thomas?
Yes, ma'am, just as fast as I can get there.
There many women out there?
Some.
Good country, I suppose.
From the Missouri to the Pacific Ocean.
Mostly good land for farming and... raising cattle and raising a family.
Are you gonna raise a family?
Well, I, uh--
Solomon, can't you play any other tune?
Sure, boss.
♪♪ That neither, Yank.
Sure do miss Mr. McCartney.
Yeah, but not his cookin'.
No, me neither.
♪ Put a feather in his hat and called it macaroni ♪♪
No lights.
- What do you think?
- Too quiet.
Ma?
- Pa?
- Happy birthday!
- We couldn't resist. Even Pacer jumped.
- Where you been?
It sure is a surprise, since my birthday was last week.
It's the first chance we had to come out.
Wash up. Supper will be out.
You spent all day working.
We thought you'd never come.
I'll take care of the horses. Eat up!
We'll do that. Will, play us some music.
How about this one?
Hey, Dorothy, never mind those dishes.
May I?
- Supper's ready.
- Supper!
- Sure is a fine-looking cake.
- I could eat a buffalo.
You dance like one.
Supper was great, Mrs. Burton.
Will and me always say... in cooking, no one would guess you were different from... well, our ma or anybody else.
I'm really proud you liked it, Tom.
Just a little more cake?
No, ma'am.
- What have we here?
- From me.
Well, now, that...
That sure is fine.
What is it?
Well, you hang it on the wall... and you put hot water in here.
It's mostly for a man to shave by, but you can comb your hair in it... or anything.
It sure is fine.
Roz is trying to civilize Clint against the day he proposes.
- If he gets around to it.
- You wear the britches... maybe you ought to propose.
Pacer and me can look more presentable when we come to the Crossing.
I thank you all, for everything.
- More coffee, anyone?
- I think we best be going.
- We can make room here for anyone.
- No, thanks.
We better go too, 10 miles can be long.
Ten? Me and Roz gotta go clear to the Crossing.
The way she rides, you'll make good time... if you can keep up with her.
We'll ride along with you a ways.
- Thank you, Mrs. Burton.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Good night, all.
- Good night.
- See you at our wedding next month.
- You better see me before that.
- Good night! Good night!
- Good night!
Take good care of her.
We better go or we won't get home by morning.
Thanks again.
- Good night, Clint.
- Good night.
- Good night, Roz.
- Night, Pacer.
- What's that look for?
- Just thinking.
With that fancy gadget to primp, you'll be the prettiest fella in Texas.
Will you be quiet?
No use waking everybody up.
- I'll put up the rig.
- I'll get us some coffee.
Quiet!
Will, I tell you... you gotta stop all this fooling around.
Making all this noise, I tell you, the old man's gonna be...
See him?
Hunter?
It's hot out there.
Indian came up on that hill just now.
Pacer says he's no hunter.
Tie up the horses.
- What is it, Sam?
- Not sure yet.
He looked like he was trying to figure something out.
Nobody said anything about trouble at the party the other night.
No, sir.
A lot of things can happen in three days.
Neddy, last time you saw your sister, you hear anything?
No, it was just about like always.
Didn't you think so, Pacer?
If trouble starts, who'll hit us first, your folks or Ma's?
Shame on you, Clint. It's more likely neither will bother us.
That ain't been my experience about people in the middle.
Maybe it's the new chief.
- What new chief?
- The Kiowas got a new chief.
- Since when?
- Maybe a month.
- What about old Lame Crow?
- He's the old man of the tribe now.
- How long you known this?
- Since it happened.
- Don't you ever tell anybody anything?
- Not if they don't ask.
Sometimes I think you're more than half Indian.
- He told me.
- Maybe you're the other half.
Maybe your ma was Indian too and didn't let me know it.
One horse.
- Are you my brother beyond the wall?
- Yes.
Then why light go out when friend come in peace?
Why does a friend who comes in peace wait until the sun is gone?
Warrior ride when stars are alive.
- Only against his enemies.
- In the world of white men... there are men who are not enemies nor friends.
- That is why I come to talk.
- Without giving your name?
I am known from one end of earth to the other.
I have the strongest magic, and I lead many, many warriors.
I am Buffalo Horn.
Buffalo Horn!
We cannot be enemies to the Kiowas without being enemies to ourselves.
- Buffalo Horn should know that.
- I must see your eyes when you tell me.
- Do you come out, or do I come in?
- Neither.
We will talk to our brother only in the sunlight.
Your answer is honest.
I will return again at a time when the sun has killed the stars.
- That was him.
- The new chief?
- By himself?
- The others were over the hill.
What do you think?
He was carrying a war spear with scalps on it.
They wouldn't do anything to us.
Maybe not.
I wouldn't be too sure.
Know what some of them still call you?
A trader said they got a name for you:
"The thin woman who deserted her own people."
- After more than 20 years.
- I don't believe it.
You boys better go to the Crossing tomorrow for supplies and ammunition.
That's fine. Fine.
Not so fine.
Won't be any time to dally with Roz.
I want you back by nightfall.
You heard Pa, no horsing around with Roz.
What do you mean "horsing around"?
- Ain't that what you're doing?
- No, it ain't.
- You mean you mean it?
- What if I do?
- With a gal that wears britches?
- What's wrong with that?
Ain't nothing wrong, but... on second thought, you might look pretty good with skirts on.
Where is everybody?
Anybody here?
I've been thinking about you, Clint.
- What's the matter, Angus?
- I've decided that you're my friend.
But if your half-breed brother comes here, I'll kill him!
You're not gonna kill anybody.
You!
- Don't make me shoot you!
- Put it down, Angus, he means it!
You better get out of here, both of you.
- Are you both crazy?!
- No, we're not crazy.
- Maybe just smarter than before.
- What are you talking about?
The Kiowas hit the Howard place the night of the party.
Of the whole family, you know how much they found in the ashes?
One hand!
- One of Dorothy's!
- Stop it!
Now he's out making a coffin for her.
Just to bury her hand in.
Oh, my God.
- They didn't hit your place, though.
- No.
And you're right out the same way.
I don't know...
Pa's out with some men now.
They'll probably get killed too.
But you don't have to worry about it.
You'll always be safe from them!
Let's go.
No. Not until we get our supplies and ammunition.
Everything all right?
Nothing's all right.
What happened?
Buffalo Horn hit the Howard place.
- Killed them all.
- Dear God!
If you hadn't tended them for fever, they'd be dead four years ago.
At these times I wonder if we did the right thing.
We did exactly the right thing.
I wish you wouldn't say such things.
What does everybody want?
There's a million miles here... room for them, us, and a million more.
It was their land, Sam.
They don't like anybody else taking part of it.
It ain't anymore.
We've worked this place for 20 years.
Nobody can tell me it ain't ours.
Did those Pierces say something about us?
- Nothing much.
- Whatever they said, it's my fault... for being what I am.
Neddy, now, you listen to me.
I'm speaking for the boys and me.
We don't want to hear such things again.
Whatever happens, we'll stick together... and we'll not be swayed.
If we have to live alone or become a power unto ourselves... we'll resist whoever and whatever comes against us.
- Hey, Clint!
- Dred Pierce.
We want to talk to you, Clint.
They're not gonna do anything.
What do you want, Dred?
The Kiowas hit the Howard place Monday.
Wiped them out.
We heard about it.
It's a terrible thing.
How'd you hear about it?
Me and Pacer was at the store this morning.
- The Indians didn't tell you about it?
- I don't want to hear that.
There's gonna be trouble.
Indians coming from everywhere.
More than a hundred already,
I've been told.
We've been tracking the ones that hit the Howard place...
- ...but we lost them.
- Get to the point.
The point is, if it comes to a showdown, are you with us or not?
- That's a foolish question.
- Not with your family.
Watch yourself. You might open your mouth once too often.
- You gonna answer the question?
- It don't need an answer.
- What did I tell you?
- It does.
Yeah, I think we got all the answers already... with all the reds and half-reds in this family.
Hold it!
The first man who tries for his gun will get a buffalo slug.
Come back here, son.
You making out that the death of old friends don't mean anything to us?
- That ain't the question.
- Then what is it?
- Well, it's a question of loyalty.
- Go on.
You know what I mean.
Your wife is Kiowa, full blood.
Pacer's half Indian.
Clint's the only real white man.
It's gonna be a bad war. Everybody around will be in it sooner or later.
Are you gonna give Clint the chance to consider the situation...
- ...and decide what he ought to do?
- I don't need to consider.
I told you we wouldn't get straight answers.
Buffalo Horn's our enemy because of what he done to the Howards.
He broke God's and man's laws.
You know my family is ready to fight our enemies.
- Is that straight enough for you?
- I suppose you mean us too.
That's up to you, Ben. We're friends with anyone who's friendly with us.
This visit ain't been friendly.
Who wants to be friendly with a man with a Kiowa squaw?
Don't shoot! Nobody else shoot!
- How is it?
- I'm bad hurt.
- Lucky it wasn't me, you'd be dead.
- Bring him in. Maybe I can help.
- I wouldn't let an Indian touch me.
- We got about all the answer we need.
Then get going, all of you!
You shoot too quick?
No, I pulled off. I couldn't just kill him, just like that.
- What are they doing?
- Stampeding the cattle.
- No use now!
- There's a couple.
- Stop him, Clint.
- Pacer! Pa don't want you to.
- Why not go after them?
- Because we'd be too few out there.
Harm's done, anyway.
Come on in.
These are what we call our white friends, I suppose.
It may take more than a day, so don't worry if we don't get back tonight.
Stay close, keep everything locked.
What if the fellas from the Crossing come back?
Think about Ma. Take care of her regardless of who comes.
Pacer.
Watch up yonder.
- What was it?
- For a second it looked like... like a man on foot, way off, up there.
- Didn't you see anything?
- No.
If it's somebody, he might need help.
Maybe you should go see.
I don't see anything, Ma.
Pa said stay near the house.
You think about what Pierce said, about joining his crowd?
- I haven't paid it any mind.
- Maybe you'd better think about it.
I didn't aim to, but I brought you boys to a bad situation.
It didn't matter when you were young, but now as men, you'll think about it.
So if you want to ride with Dred and them, I'll try to understand.
You'll go with my blessing.
You already said it.
There's only one side for us... you, and Ma, and Pacer and me.
Oh, no.
- They shot them!
- I should've killed Matt Holcum.
We should've cut them all down.
They're worse than Indians!
An Indian will rob you blind, but this is waste and meanness.
It's done.
Let's find the rest of the herd.
Pacer, you ought to get a little sleep at least.
- I'll be all right. Go on back to bed.
- Good night, Pacer.
Ma.
- What is it?
- I don't know yet.
Strangers.
Hey, in there!
Yeah?
Can you maybe spare a bite?
- Who are you?
- We're trappers.
- We got chased out of the hills.
- Too much trouble brewing.
We're getting out of this country.
We're half-starved.
Let them in.
- I ain't sure.
- We can't turn them away hungry.
Sure mighty neighborly of you.
- Hey, you Indians?
- Yeah.
- You two work here?
- This is our home.
How do you like that?
Indians living in a house like this.
- How about getting us supper, red boy?
- I'm fixing something.
Is that your ma?
- What are you making, honey?
- Meat stew.
I have to warm it up a little.
Get me another log, Pacer.
You'll sit down at the table.
- Didn't you hear your ma, red boy?
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
- Then hurry up and get it.
Where's the heap big chief?
Your husband, or whoever he is.
He'll be back soon.
But he's not a chief, he's white.
Oh? That's it, huh?
You like them white?
I like my husband.
That ain't all, is it? One man for a good-looking squaw like you?
Please.
Come on. I know you red babies.
- Please, mister.
- What are you afraid of?
- Joe will watch the door.
- Let me go.
All right, I tell you what.
You just give me one little kiss, and see if you don't want a few more.
Pa and Clint are back.
They'll be in, in a minute.
These men can't wait.
They're leaving now.
Pacer.
If it hadn't been for that kid...
All right. Get off your horses.
Did you hear what I said?
Drop your gun belts.
Come on, hurry it up.
If you're aiming to rob us, you're wasting your time.
We ain't got anything.
I might kill you, but I ain't gonna rob you.
- We've had enough trouble with Indians.
- All he asked for was a little kiss.
I'm telling you, now, boy.
That's a little better, red boy.
Please, I'm done!
Stop!
- Yes?
- It's me!
Pacer!
- I wanted to make sure they went away.
- That's all?
You're bleeding.
I tripped in the dark.
You landed awful hard on your knuckles.
Inside, Ma! Inside, come on!
Two Moons is with them.
- Kiowa Pacer!
- Yes?
It is a new time. The sun has killed the stars. Come out and talk!
I will not come out among your warriors.
I'm your friend. Nothing will happen to you if you come out.
Nothing will happen to me if I stay behind my walls either.
Now you come out?
Wait a minute!
Give me your rifle. Put this on!
If anything happens, bolt the door.
This is how men talk, with their eyes seeing if words are true or false.
- You talk, I will listen.
- I need many, many more warriors.
The white man is thick from the rising sun to the setting sun.
We have no place to go.
We have to fight, or we die.
You understand?
This is the great war our gods have spoken to us in our dreams.
Soon we will have the power to take whole white villages!
You say you are not our enemy.
Then you must be friend.
Will you ride with us?
You have many warriors.
One more warrior is not important.
You are of the greatest importance to me.
For if a half-white leaves his father's people for his mother's people... it'll make the strongest magic
I can have.
If I say no?
Not being my friend, you will be my enemy.
And this house and all in it will die!
For I will not have a half-Kiowa against me!
- Come in here a minute, Pacer.
- I must talk to my mother.
- We'll go back with him.
- Back where?
To their camp.
I'll talk this over with Lame Crow.
- You mean, about me?
- The whole thing, war and everything.
Lame Crow's my uncle, maybe he can stop it.
They wouldn't care about what you said.
I'll try it anyway.
I can't see all these people being killed without trying to stop it.
- Write Pa where we're going.
- Ma, wait and talk to Pa first.
No, he'd lock me up or something.
Tell him we'll be back by midnight.
I can't let you do it, Ma.
It's too dangerous.
But they wouldn't hurt us, Pacer.
They're our own people.
They ain't my people. Truthfully,
I don't know who's my people.
Maybe I ain't got any.
I couldn't ride with those guys, burning and killing.
I know, Pacer.
- That's what he's asking me to do, Ma!
- You can say no.
I can say no here. What if he asks me there, in the middle of them?
But he wouldn't do that.
You'd be his guest.
You haven't seen his eyes when he talks about this war.
He'll ask me, all right, guest or not.
And if I don't say yes...
Then I don't think you ought to go either. I'll go alone.
This is so important, my mother thinks we should talk to her family.
- You'll come to the safety of our camp?
- Yes.
Your mother is wise.
We will ride with you.
- What do you think about this war?
- Buffalo Horn say it got to be.
He say if we wait any longer it will be too late.
It must be harder for you, half white, half Indian.
It is not easy.
- White men treat you well?
- My father and brother do.
If anything starts, take my horse and ride out.
Welcome, N'edd'ee-pahs.
- I come to you with love, and gifts.
- Show me.
Take her to Lame Crow.
She wants to talk to him.
Come.
Sit.
Pacer is brother.
We make him welcome. Speak, anyone.
Kiowa Pacer, is true Earth round like ball? White man live all sides?
That is true.
Tell me, why man on bottom not fall off?
I've never been there. Maybe they do.
"Dear Pa and Clint,
Ma took a notion to see her sister.
I told her not, but you know Ma.
I think we will be back by midnight.
I tried to make her not go, but you know Ma.
Respectfully yours, Pacer."
Now, why do you reckon she wanted to do that?
- We'll go after them.
- Wait a minute.
Ten o'clock. We'd better wait the two hours... rather than miss them in the dark.
Then we'll go after them with the scatterguns.
If they do anything to Ma and Pacer, scatterguns can make an awful mess.
Many moon back, I see white man book.
In it was great mountain lion with stripe painted on fur.
Speak me this, Kiowa Pacer. Why white man paint stripe on mountain lion?
That was a great animal called a tiger.
They didn't paint the stripes on it.
Could be then, this great tiger paint on own stripes.
Which make tiger brother to my Kiowa warriors.
We didn't speak about the thing
I came to talk about.
Yes. My spirit reached out and touched you... and I knew it was not good to speak of it now.
It will be hard for you to come back to us. You are not yet ready.
If I asked you now to say yes or no, you might say no.
Or you might lie to me and say yes.
But I would know that you lie, and I'd have to kill you.
We are close in spirit now.
I want you to come back to your people.
- You think about it?
- I will.
Think of this too. Whose land is this?
Who has lived here since the beginning of time?
Do we go out to take their land?
No, they come against us!
Forever cutting deeper into our land.
Forever taking! Forever pushing!
We will speak of it again soon.
I hope your blood will be one with ours.
Two Moons.
Take me to Lame Crow.
I will ride part of the way back with you.
Ready, Ma?
I go in goodwill.
It's all right, Ma.
They wouldn't even listen to me.
None of them.
They said I wasn't Kiowa anymore, nor white either.
My own sister said I was nothing!
You done the best you could, Ma.
Kill them!
Will!
It's Will Howard!
Ma?
Ma?
- Pacer, I'm dying.
- No, Ma.
I can feel, close to me, the flaming star of death.
Stop talking like that, Ma.
I don't think it's too bad.
It'll be all right.
- Who is it?
- It's me and Clint, Pacer!
Ma is hurt!
- It was Will Howard that done it.
- Will Howard?
- Two Moons tried to stop him.
- Honey?
Neddy, honey!
Let's put her in the back.
- Clint.
- We're all here. You'll be all right.
We're going home, honey.
That's all we can do for her now.
- Tell me what happened.
- Will jumped up and started shooting.
He must have been wandering since the raid.
- You think he knew what he was doing?
- He thought he saw three Indians.
He must have been crazy with pain... after what happened to his family.
- You making excuses for him?
- Had you not killed him, we would have.
- We need a doctor.
- I'll get Doc Phillips.
What if he don't want to come?
He won't have a choice.
Those folks are mad. I'd better go too.
Try not to have any trouble, but get him.
We'll get him.
Dred, they're coming!
They're here, Ben!
- Don't worry about shooting our cattle.
- Don't come no closer!
We don't want to see you boys here again.
We need Doc Phillips.
You don't need him any more than we do.
You know what I mean!
We need him right away!
- What's wrong?
- Ma's hurt.
Go inside.
- What happened?
- Will Howard shot her.
- What? Will Howard's dead.
- He's dead now, but he shot Ma first.
- Now, if he's just dead, who killed him?
- Me.
Hold it! Everybody hold it!
Just keep them covered!
If shooting starts, I'll kill you.
Will Howard's been dead for nearly a week and everybody knows it.
Will wasn't far from dead, but he was alive enough to shoot Ma.
Pa, we gotta help her!
He's just lying, honey.
The both of them!
Hey, doc! Doc Phillips!
All right, come out, doc!
Ain't nobody gonna do anything to you.
Ma needs you, doc.
- You know I want to help her, but...
- It's a free country, doc.
If you can't decide, maybe we can help you.
- Let's vote, everybody! I vote no!
- And I go along with Dred!
- I say don't go!
- I say no!
- I vote doc don't go!
- I speak the same!
I say no too. But I can give you some advice: Get a medicine man for her.
- Cover me, I'll get him.
- Two dead men are worth nothing.
You see how it is, Clint.
- Clint!
- Come on.
- What are you doing?
- I got an idea. Don't look back!
You saw that kid playing back at doc's house?
I can do it.
As soon as you make it,
I'll come in fast.
We'll have a tea party. How many lumps of sugar would you like?
- Dorothy, don't get dirty.
- I won't, it's clean dirt.
Would you like some cream?
Okay, I want some cream.
Here's some cream for you, baby.
My baby's been sick.
She's got a temperature.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with her.
- I'll probably...
- It's just me. We'll play a game, okay?
Sure, Pacer. But you scared me.
- Your pa will play too.
- He don't play good.
Hey, doc! Doc Phillips!
Leave her alone!
- Get your horse and bag! Make it fast!
- Don't hurt her!
Go on, do like he says!
If you hurt her, I'll get you, savage!
Stay where you are, Pierce!
Indian, any harm comes to that girl and you're dead!
Just keep talking, Ford, you'll be dead now!
Adults can't play, eh?
This is funny playing, Pacer.
I don't like it much.
I won't hurt you, Dottie.
Doc's gonna come with us.
Oh, my baby!
If anybody follows us, there'll be pure hell to pay!
Sorry. I wanted to come with you from the start.
Shut up!
- They following us?
- Just one. Come on, this way!
Keep quiet, now.
Can I help you with her, Clint?
- You need her, doc?
- She's helped me before.
All right, let's go.
Neddy?
Neddy!
Neddy!
Neddy, honey!
Answer me!
Honey!
Neddy, honey!
Neddy, why did you do it?
Sam...
I saw the flaming star of death.
Oh, no!
No, honey!
No!
One thing from the Bible she liked:
"And Adam called his wife's name Eve... as she was the mother of all living."
To me, Neddy, you were the mother of all the living.
You were life itself.
God... just one thing.
Take care of this woman.
Amen.
Why don't you two eat before everything gets cold?
I'm gonna wait for Pa.
He wouldn't want you to wait.
You know who done it, don't you?
You!
That won't do any good.
Wasting all that time.
You and them other people!
I couldn't have done anything.
I saw that wound...
- Nobody wanted to do anything!
- That's not true.
- And you neither!
- Stop that.
But you saw him! Arguing and stalling, all the time Ma's dying!
Keeping us more than an hour!
Five minutes before we arrived, she died!
If we'd gotten here a little bit sooner she might be alive!
You know it's his fault.
- Put it down!
- Get out of the way!
They let her die!
I couldn't have saved her.
The woman was bleeding internally!
The woman?
- She's got a name, like whites!
- Pacer!
Well, I meant Mrs. Burton.
See? All she was to all of them was a squaw.
This won't bring Ma back.
A white man shot her... and a white man let her die!
Drop it!
Please, Pacer, drop it.
Please.
- You all right?
- You're both crazy!
You ought to have let me kill him.
No good could be done. It wouldn't help.
People that held us up at the Crossing...
I want to see every one of them dead.
You're talking foolish.
You sound like a...
A Kiowa?
- I wasn't gonna say that.
- That's what I am.
That's what Ma was and why she's dead.
That's what I'm gonna be from now on.
You know I didn't mean it that way.
You don't feel it like
I do about Ma's death.
I'm Indian.
I won't forget whites killed her because of it!
- Will was dying, he was crazy!
- I don't want no more excuses for him.
All whites ever gave me and Ma was mean looks and insults.
That's not true!
You were the worst.
You made me feel it the worst.
When I was little, I liked you a lot.
You were the only girl
I liked a whole lot.
Since you been old enough, you never looked at me without thinking:
"He's Kiowa.
Clint's all right, but watch out for Pacer."
Oh, I didn't know!
I didn't know it either.
Nobody knew but Ma and me.
Where you going?
- To join up with Buffalo Horn.
- You're a civilized man!
- Folks at the Crossing are civilized.
- You can't go.
Now, look, we already had one fight.
The first one we ever had.
I won't lose this one!
This ain't to be fought with fists.
I'm changing my life.
Put that gun down.
All right.
If you can draw that gun and cock it... then get out.
And to hell with you!
Just don't come after me.
Is this goodbye?
Yes, sir.
- Back to Ma's folks?
- I'm sorry.
So am I, but I understand.
It never come to my mind it would be like this when I married Neddy.
I guess folks ain't never been fair with you.
They take a man for what he ought to be, not what he is.
- I ain't blaming you.
- I know. You're a good boy.
I've always been proud of you.
Do what you must do... with my blessings. No matter where you go, whatever happens.
Goodbye, son.
Bye, Pa.
Funny how things turn out.
When I got here, all I had was you and me. You were just a baby.
Then I gave Neddy's father a shotgun and a pound of black powder for her.
What a pretty little thing she was too!
The day we got married there wasn't a prettier girl in Texas.
I can't tell you how much
I came to love her.
After all these years, and another little baby and all our work... to make a home and get us a herd...
We're right back where we started.
Just you and me again.
I will fight in his place.
- Who did this?
- A white man.
He also killed N'edd'ee-pahs, the woman who was my mother.
My words are dust.
But my heart is with you.
One thing you must know.
I will never fight my father nor my brother.
Your father, your brother, and your home... will be safe from attack, as our own people.
When we fight,
I will think of my mother... and of how Two Moons tried to help her.
And I will be strong.
Very strong.
- I'll be back to see you, Pa.
- You do that, Roz.
- We'll do the best we can anyway.
- We'll sure try.
That bay is still limping.
I'm giving you the sorrel.
We'll give your horse back later.
- Bye, Pa.
- Bye.
Don't go too far.
- Let the herd take care of itself.
- I'll be all right.
I won't say what Pacer had in mind.
He'll be back.
I don't know.
He's been pushed a long way.
- I wonder if you'll be back.
- I said I would, didn't I?
It's plain hate now.
Everybody's ready to kill anybody who isn't just like them.
I'll be back, all right.
- Get down and into the house!
- Don't talk like that.
- I'm no girl, I'm a woman.
- Want me to pull you down?
I don't.
- You know Neddy died?
- I know a lot of things.
I know Pacer went at doc with a knife.
I know the Thomases died last night.
All four of them.
Nothing left but ashes!
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah, I'll bet.
You know that Phil Thomas was my best friend.
Then why didn't you warn him?
Goodbye, Roz.
Wait, Dred! You got room for us?
We'll make room for you!
That's the fifth wagon in this morning.
They're all scared to death. But I guess you got nothing to worry about.
He is alone. Let us kill him.
Maybe it's best if we find
Buffalo Horn before fighting.
The gods are making us a gift of this enemy.
Hang on, Clint!
I thought you were so tough!
Feels like you're trying to torture me to death.
You damn savage!
Can you hear me?
- We have to get out of here.
- You go. I'm too tired.
We still got about an hour before daylight.
What are you doing?
I'm gonna try and draw them the other way. They'd recognize this.
Crazy.
- Maybe in the dark I'll look Indian.
- Your hair's too short.
If we're not out of here by sunup, it'll be a lot shorter.
We're never gonna get a better time than this.
- Think you can hold on again?
- I can make it.
Come on. Watch your head.
They still coming?
Yeah, but they're in no hurry anymore.
Why?
They know who we are now, and where to find us.
Hey, Pa!
Pa!
Pa's dead.
Kiowas.
- We're all the family we got left now.
- That's right.
We got to get in the house and get ready.
Pacer?
Pacer!
Come on.
- What's the idea?
- You're gonna take a ride.
What are you talking about? I'm going in the house. We got to get ready.
- What are you doing?
- He'll take you to the Crossing.
- Are you coming with me?
- Nope.
- That's crazy. There are too many.
- I know it.
But if it's gonna be like this the rest of my life, to hell with it!
Let me meet them with you.
That's the way I feel.
You'll be doing good to make it to the Crossing.
Pacer!
- How long have I been here?
- Since last night.
- Get me a horse.
- Doc says you shouldn't move.
- I'm not staying here.
- You can't ride in your condition.
- Get me that horse!
- I can't...
- You feeling better?
- Never mind, I'll get it myself.
- Now, look here, Clint.
- You want to get shot?
Rider coming in!
Looks like he's bad hurt.
Don't come no closer.
I wanted to make sure you're all right.
Don't try to help me, Clint.
I've been killed already.
I'm just stubborn about dying.
- Let me get the doc.
- Too late.
Too late.
The only thing to do now is to die.
Pacer! For God's sake!
You live for me, Clint.
Maybe someday... somewhere, people will understand folks like us.
Oh, you'll be all right.
When I was fighting off the other Kiowas...
I saw the flaming star of death.
I gotta last long enough to go into the hills and die.
I'll trust you not to follow me, Clint.
Pacer!
Hey, Pacer!
Pacer!
He dies for a rifle.
¿Murió bien, eh?
¿Pero para qué?
¿Para esto?
¡Para nada! ¡Para nada!
Whoa.
Let's go, men.
¡Alto!
¡Chica! Vàmonos!
Good morning, amigo.
Maybe you can help me.
No hablo inglés.
Esto es Mexico.
I'm sorry.
I don't speak Español.
Can I help you?
- What was he saying?
- That you're in Mexico now.
That anyone coming to Mexico ought to be speaking Spanish.
You, uh, in command here?
No, but I speak English.
Seen this man?
Hey, Joe.
- Mornin', darlin'.
- Where you going, Joe?
Well, I'm, uh...
I'm on my way.
You say all day, all night.
All night, all day?
Did I say that?
- You say.
- Ah.
Well, uh, things is different now.
The soldiers.
Yeah.
I gotta go.
Why don't you try this hotel.
He may be in there.
You mean they let Indians in there?
Anyone who can pay, sir.
One moment, please.
What is your name?
I am Lieutenant Franz Von Klemme from the Imperial German Army.
I'm what you'd call an adviser.
I'm Lyedecker.
Policeman.
You got some money?
Money?
What the hell for?
Get out of the window!
For me, yes?
Some dollars for me?
I saw you got dollars.
- I thought you said you loved me.
- Sure.
You give me money?
Yeah, well, later, maybe, huh?
I yell pretty loud.
Then the sergeant come up.
You want to talk to them?
What do you want to do with them?
Well...
Well, what do you mean?
They were pulling out the railroad track.
Your track.
Oh, my company's.
Not mine.
Why do they do that?
Damn it!
Why?
Why have they been fighting us for 400 years?
Because they're Yaqui Indians, that's why.
They call them los tigres de la rocas... the tigers of the rocks.
They say your track is on their land.
What shall we do about it?
Oh, whatever's customary.
Whatever you think is right.
Of course.
Muy bien.
Verdugo...
Verdugo...
I'm no part of this.
Do what you like... a trial.
I'm no part of this.
Look.
I know the value of things.
Bullets are valuable.
These are not.
No.
Listen.
Don't be like that.
You can give me money... or I'll make you some trouble.
Come here.
- Sargento Paletes!
- Señor.
Run! Run!
Run, Indians!
Run, Indians! Run!
Run!
Hey!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
¡Cabrón!
Mi general.
He is our prisoner.
Too bad I had to interrupt your entertainment up there.
Yes, you distracted my soldiers...
disbanded the Indians...
Very clever.
But now I got you.
Yeah.
Well, you wouldn't have me if that hotel had a back door.
Very clever.
Very clever.
Now, General, you don't wanna do that.
He's a very valuable man.
If you got to kill him, why don't you let me have him?
Perhaps I will kill you too.
That won't get you very much either.
- He's your friend?
- He's no friend of mine.
Well, then, what is he to you?
Bank robber.
He stole $6,000 from the Citizen's Bank in Phoenix, Arizona.
Mr. Lyedecker... how much did you say he stole?
Six thousand dollars.
- Uh-huh. When?
- Twelve days ago.
Twelve days, huh?
I see.
Fifty dollars.
Where is the rest?
You look Mexican, but you don't talk Mexican.
- What the hell are you?
- Well, I sure as hell ain't no damn Mexican.
My mama was a Yaqui Indian... and my daddy was from Alabama.
I see.
Well, I hope you know how to die.
I admire a man who dies well.
Now, tell me... where is the money? Hmm?
The money.
All those dollars you speak of.
Where are they?
Women and whiskey.
That's what I'd do if I was him.
Oh?
Six thousand dollars in 12 days?
Oh!
You could be the biggest stallion in the world...
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
$6,000 worth of whores in 12 days?
Now...
No.
No, it was not spent on women or on whiskey.
Now, for the last time, where is the money?
Just like he said, jefe.
Half of it I spent on whiskey and women... and the other half I wasted.
Excuse me, sir, but if he spent the entire night in the hotel... don't you...
Yes.
Yes, let's go and take a look.
Where is the money?
Hey, friend, I hear your mama sells it on the street.
I don't think he understands English.
All that's fine.
But where's the money?
You really the honest-to-God law?
Somethin' wrong with that?
No! No.
You caught me, didn't ya?
That's right.
Now I gotta see about gettin' you out of here.
See, you bein' the Yankee law don't cut no ice with the Mexican army.
They ain't gonna let you get out of here.
Well, why don't you buy us out?
The money ain't worth gettin' killed for, now, is it?
I ain't got no money.
- Bank says different.
- Oh, I took it, all right.
But I spent it two days later.
- What did you spend it on?
- Rifles.
Rifles?
One hundred rifles for the Yaqui Indians.
Them poor devils hangin' on them telephone poles out there... them's Yaqui Indians... my people.
Well, if you tellin' the truth... that general's gonna kill you real slow.
Well, let me tell you about that general.
They told him to get rid of the Yaquis any way he could... and he took the easy way.
He's just killin' everybody.
Well, you've spent enough time in the States. You as American as me.
And you know you just can't go around stickin' up banks.
Yeah.
But I ain't goin' back.
Yes, you are.
On foot, on horseback, or hangin' across a saddle, you're goin' back.
How is it over there?
It's crowded over here.
How about out there?
Well, I think, with a little bit of luck, we might be able to get out of this.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm gonna jump right out that window behind you.
Go ahead.
¡Sargento Paletes!
¡Vamos! ¡Rapido!
Yaqui!
Mi caballo.
¡Sargento! ¡Vamos!
Well, I think we lost 'em.
All of'em.
Well, do you bring the rifles?
You damn betcha.
Romero send you?
Where are the rifles, Joe?
How come he sent a woman?
- They're expecting a man.
- Oh.
Now, uh, where are the rifles, Joe?
On the Chilina trail, not too far from here.
Well, I hope so.
They're there.
And where is the profit for you, Joe?
There ain't none, Sarita.
Look, you told me to get the rifles, and I got 'em.
- What are you bein'so tough on me for?
- Because I know you.
Boy, you sure have soured up in the last few years, ain't ya?
Yes. I have changed.
I watched them hang my father... and I helped him to die.
You hear that?
I helped my father to die.
You say the Chilina trail?
Yeah.
We'll see.
Mara.
Oh, shoot.
Now, why'd you do that?
I wasn't gonna do nothin'
I couldn't have done before.
You're pretty good, Joe.
I can't take any chances with you.
- Let's go.
- Where we goin'?
Back to Phoenix.
How come them to give you a badge in the first place?
Well, I guess I took a job that nobody else wanted.
Even at that, it took me a whole year to get it.
- How much they gon' give you for takin' me back?
- Two hundred dollars.
And the job permanent-like.
Shoot, that ain't even hardly worth botherin' about.
Well, Joe, that depends on what you got in the first place.
Yeah.
I ain't never been worth a damn in my whole damn life.
Ain't never been worth nothin' to talk about.
I never even had a job permanent-like.
But now I finally done somethin' for somebody... me.
I finally amounted to somethin'.
Yeah.
You robbed a bank.
Let's go.
I should have known.
You lied to me.
There's no sign of tracks.
No people. No guns.
What are you talkin' about?
They're there. Come on. I'll show you.
You ain't goin' nowhere.
- Where do you find him?
- I didn't find him! He found me!
Will he help us?
- Señor, will you help?
- Hell, no.
- Why not? You ain't got nothin' better to do.
- It ain't my party.
Come on.
So, we meet again, huh?
You murderer!
You assassin!
Too bad I don't have enough time for you right now.
Lopez!
Now you...
Mr. Sheriff.
Mr. Half-breed.
By the time
I'm through with you... you'll be ready to tell me everything I want to know.
I'm not afraid.
Damn it!
Stay on your feet!
Go to hell!
Damn you, you big son of a...
Muy bien.
Ay. Look what the rurales found.
Rifles.
Two Indians with these mules.
Now, how would two Indians... find 100 rifles, huh?
They were skinned alive.
Slowly.
But they wouldn't say.
Tsk tsk.
Nice day, Verdugo.
Indeed it is, Mr. Grimes.
Hello.
My name's Grimes.
Steven Grimes.
Oh, that's... that's nice.
Mighty nice.
Well...
You know, fellow Americans.
And, uh, what's a nice fellow like you doing in a place like this?
I'm with Southern Pacific.
We run the railroads here.
Then, uh, you're really all right with that general, ain't you?
Look, Lyedecker, what's the point of all this?
If you don't tell him what he wants to know, he'll have you killed.
Well, maybe put a good word in for us.
- Why don't you get the hell outta here?
- Tell him something.
Anything.
Six thousand dollars is not worth dying for.
And he's just gonna let us go.
Is that right?
Why don't you go away and stop botherin' us?
Look.
If he has you shot, it'll create terrible problems.
- It'll be a terrible thing for all of us.
- Sure as hell will.
- For us or for the railroad?
- For both.
The way relations are between the United
States and Mexico...Well, you know.
Look... we don't wanna talk to you.
You understand?
We don't wanna talk to you.
Hey, wait a minute, Joe.
Wait a minute.
He's got the rifles, and he's got us too.
What do we got to lose?
Tell you what you do.
You go tell that general I wanna see him.
What about my men?
How are they progressing?
Well, sir, they fight well, they train well.
They don't seem to take too naturally to the drill.
Well, the parades will come later.
As long as they can fight.
Sit down.
Sit down.
What disturbs you?
The rifles, sir.
Someone is arming the Yaquis.
If they get hold of any more guns, you're going to have the tiger by its tail.
The Yaquis do not have the rifles.
I do.
Yes, sir, at the moment you do.
Von Klemme, you worry me.
That was my intent, sir.
No. I mean, you worry me.
- Oh?
- Yes.
You...You seem afraid.
Of what?
I don't know.
Perhaps if you would return to Mexico City...
I would prefer nothing more than that, sir, if my orders could be changed.
You know that I don't need you.
But, you see, sir... we Germans are here to advise, so we advise.
Oh, yes.
Now, tell me, what perfect piece of advice have you this time?
Finish off the Yaquis as quickly as possible before more guns come through.
I know that, don't I?
Of course you do. Then send them south and sell them to the wood merchants.
No. It isn't worth it.
The prices are too low.
I have to feed them, send some of my men with them.
By the time we sell one, the price will be lower than the price of a cow.
Then kill them all.
That is your advice?
That is my advice, sir.
Very good.
So, all the time, eh?
All the time the $6,000 was right there in my front yard, huh?
Incredible.
- I'll take him back now, General.
That's the deal. Right?
- Now wait.
Wait.
Tell me something.
Where are the other rifles?
I don't know what you're talking about.
When do they arrive?
Answer the question, Indian.
- You got 'em all.
- That is not the answer!
- There ain't no more guns!
- How do you know that?
You know, Lyedecker, as I told you before,
I think you're part of it.
I ain't a part of anything!
This man stole $6,000. For that amount of money, there can't be no more guns.
You refuse to answer, eh?
Look, there ain't no more damn guns.
Very well.
Too bad, gentlemen.
¡Sargento Paletes!
What did all that mean?
Look like they're gonna shoot us.
Verdugo, I suggested that if they told you about the money... you'd let them go.
Grimes, you run the railroad.
I'll run the state of Sonora.
And don't you ever forget it.
- Por favor, General...
- ¡No, señor!
¡Alto!
You know somethin'?
What?
I think our string has done run out.
The hell it has.
We're gonna get out of this.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- How?
- Well, there's nothin' to it.
A big, giant hand is gonna reach in here, pick us up... take us away and put us down someplace... right in the middle of a whole bunch of women and whiskey.
That ain't funny.
Well, I ain't laughin' neither.
That ain't funny at all!
Stay out of other people's business.
That's what I always said and that's what I always done.
But look at me now.
Smart Lyedecker.
Hung up on a fence with a bunch of scruffy Indians.
Well, that's too bad about you.
Your number's comin' up over there, and it's just too damn bad.
- You know why?
- No, I don't know why. Why?
- 'Cause you'd have been a hell of a lawman.
- You damn right!
'Cause you don't care about nothin' or nobody... just like all them big boys with their badges.
What do you know about badges?
You're just a pissant border half-breed.
I know a lot about it.
I know all about them small-town, barbershop, hair-cuttin' sheriffs.
And I know all about them big-town, big-bellied... billy club-swingin' policemen from St. Louis.
- You don't know nothin'!
- The hell I don't!
They look you up and down, and you're guilty!
You don't get no trial, just like we ain't gonna get one now!
'Cause them guys over there don't care about nothin' or nobody, just like you!
That's why you'd have been so good with a badge.
Washington's going to react very badly to this.
What are they going to do?
Send a note saying,
"Where is our black policeman?"
- And then what?
- They'll ask questions.
They're going to ask my company a great many questions.
And they will get answers,
I'm sure.
Your company cares for its trains... not for two gringos that disappear in Mexico.
¡Fuego!
Hold it, gentlemen.
Padre.
My sons, allow me to help you...
We ain't no damn sons of yours.
There's probably more than one scattered around here someplace.
Fear and despair are human failings.
Yet we are human.
Make yourselves ready to die in peace and love.
Why don't you talk to Verdugo about some of that peace and love... instead of tryin' to get somebody ready to die.
That's right.
Ain't no man ever died ready for it.
I want you to go with love in your hearts.
I want you to go to hell.
Allow me to hear your confession.
Whatever you got in that book, just put me down for it.
- Lyedecker.
- What?
I'm sorry you got mixed up in this.
You ain't half as sorry as me.
¡Ataque!
What the hell?
Goddamn it!
Come on! Come on!
¡Rapido!
¡Vamos! ¡Vamos!
Hyah! Hyah!
I want their heads.
Some kind of woman, ain't she?
Yeah. Kinda stout.
Now that you got them rifles...
what are you gonna do with 'em?
- Take 'em to General Romero.
- General.
Why every time four Mexicans get together, one of'em makes himself a general?
Look, you.
Romero can call himself anything he wants.
I knew him when he was young... when he brought the people together to fight.
Good or bad, he's all we have.
It's a good thing you have him,
'cause me and that one there, we goin' north.
We are, huh?
Yeah.
What do you say we wait till we get them rifles to General Romero?
Then I'll go easy-like.
Uh-uh. No good.
Lyedecker, you're a mule-headed son of a bitch.
You saw all them Indians hung up like a side of beef.
- After all the trouble we went through to get them rifles...
- We?
Yeah, we!
Look, I spent 15 years in the 9th Cavalry... keepin' the law and chasin' bad Indians.
But this one ain't my business, it ain't my fight and it ain't my job!
And besides...
I don't much like Indians anyway.
We should have killed him!
Yeah.
I think she's right.
You know your trouble, big man?
You're dumb.
Just plain ol'black-ass dumb!
Now who's dumb, you half-breed?
Huh?
I am!
Let me up!
Come on!
Thank you.
Don't shoot him!
And let him kill you?
The rifles, they are more important.
I don't wanna drag his big ass all over Mexico.
- What's it gon' be?
- I guess I ain't got much of a choice, have I?
We split up here.
You take the guns upriver.
I'll meet you in Delgado.
I'm glad to meet you.
Ah.
Woman, what are they looking at?
It's the first time they've seen a black man before.
Well, if they wait a while, they'll see this one turn into a chili bean.
I sure wish I had myself a fried steak.
Well, two or three times now, you could've killed me.
Sí.
That is true.
- I need you.
- What for?
Mira.
Those rifles, they are what keeps Joe here.
He is what keeps you here.
I want you to help us.
No, I won't do that.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. Yeah, I reckon I am.
Oh, not of being shot at.
That's happened plenty before.
Lyedecker, if... if you would join with us... for just a little while...
I won't worry about YaquiJoe.
Afterwards, you can have him.
You ain't, uh, partial to him?
No.
I don't trust him.
He's a bad man.
But he's smart... and he's important for us now.
Nothing else?
No.
Nothing.
No deals. I'm gonna take him back, and there ain't gonna be no deals.
We got problems. Verdugo's about one mile behind us, but I don't think he saw us.
Get the rifles. Let's get out of here.
¡Vámonos!
Adios.
Gracias, kid.
Keep goin'!
Go on!
- ¡ Sargento!
- Mi general.
Collect all the children and take them to the rancho.
With the general's permission, the time might be better spent collecting the rifles.
Von Klemme, I'm gonna tell you something once and for all...
and let it be a lesson for your future.
I never do anything without a purpose, and remember that.
Humara.
Los niños. Los niños.
El rancho.
El rancho.
Yaqui.
The children.
They've taken all of the children... and holding them for the rifles.
They're holding 'em for us too, you can bet.
Well, we have to go back.
Look, Sarita, I think we ought to go on to Romero... give 'em the guns, and get some more men, huh?
No. We have to get those children.
We will.
We'd better make this quick and quiet.
Shh!
Well, I wonder if he died ready for it.
Get them kids out of here!
Hey, big fella.
How you doin', man?
Where's Joe?
Where's the whiskey?
I guess you never can tell where they might go to drink, huh?
Don't-Don't shoot, Lyedecker!
For God's sake, don't shoot!
- I didn't know it was you.
- Obviously!
Hey, Joe, look what I found.
Hey, Big Ben.
You ain't still thinking about taking me to Phoenix with you, are ya?
You'd better believe it, hombre.
Well, you're a stubborn, son of a...
Damn.
Well, what's you gonna do with him?
Well, uh, whatever's customary and whatever you think is right.
I'll-I'll be glad to take care of him for you.
Lyedecker, this is silly.
There's no need for...
Keep him alive.
We might be able to use him later.
I'll do it.
Didn't turn out to be much, did it?
Hmm?
Pretty fancy, huh?
For me?
Too fancy for me?
She had one like it when my father worked here a long time ago.
She's dead now...
Verdugo's wife.
I always wanted one like it.
It looks like you were born for it.
It's a lie. But you're a pretty good man after all, Lyedecker.
I guess I know that.
I know what I am.
I don't have to go looking for it.
Then why are you a policeman?
It's a job.
Everybody has to do something.
What the job is ain't important.
It's how you do it.
Are you good at what you do?
Well, it ain't much different than the cavalry. I do the best I can.
Well, that is a hard thing to do.
For all the bad things
I have said to you...
I give you this.
No. No! No!
No! No!
Please, not like this!
Not with you.
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
¡ Viva Lyedecker!
Lyedecker.
He died yesterday.
Ah, sí. The black gringo.
We have heard of you.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Buenos días, mi general.
Good day for travelin', and we're gonna travel.
Hey.
What is this stuff?
What is this "mi general"?
- You mean you don't know?
- No, I don't know.
Well, it seems that you have been elected the new general.
I ain't no damn general.
That's just...
That's the dumbest...
That's just plumb crazy! Come on!
Buenos días, general.
Look, you tell them to get out of here.
Tell them I don't want 'em following me.
Tell 'em to go away.
Tell 'em I ain't no general.
Not for no bad-ass Indians.
Not for nobody.
You tell 'em.
It looks to me like... you're back in the cavalry business...
mi general.
I'm sure the rifles are somewhere up there.
I can promise you that, with Romero.
No.
If he gets the guns and the ammunition... he will probably come down that mountain, and we'll have war.
I know Romero.
He's a dying tiger.
He wouldn't come downhill with an army of 10,000 cannons.
No.
Lyedecker is the one.
I want his head on a stick in the middle of the plaza for everyone to see.
Lyedecker and the others.
Sir, I personally think we ought to be going after Romero.
Now, listen to me, Von Klemme.
I know Romero.
I know these mountains.
I know my country, and you don't!
So shut up.
Shut up and follow my orders.
I want Lyedecker.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
- Buenos noches, mi general.
Buenos noches, mi general.
Lyedecker?
Oh. Your supper is almost ready.
- Tortillas?
- No.
Look what I found.
You said fried steak.
Is that, um, the way it is?
If that's the way you want it.
No.
Let me get that.
Here?
Lyedecker, you are my man.
You know, you gotta be, uh, careful about a thing like that.
I don't have to be careful.
I am your woman for as long as you want it.
Do you want me?
What does Verdugo use that train for?
- What are you going to do?
- Answer the question.
Now, look, you can't be...
You're not going to wreck the train?
In one minute, I'm gonna pinch off your head... and mail it back to the home office.
The train carries troops and supplies from Nogales to Hermosillo.
It's well-guarded.
Does it make any stops along the way?
No.
- No stops.
- There is a water tower...
in the plano, the flat part.
He stops there.
Now, look, you're not going to wreck the train.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Lyedecker...
God!
Dear God!
He ain't gonna help you.
¡ Hey, muchachos!
¡Una muchacha!
No, no, no, no.
He ain't here.
Well, must be he didn't make the trip then...
'cause I've been watchin' this car all the time.
- How many did we lose?
- I don't know for sure.
Hey. You did a real fine job.
You seen Grimes?
No.
Last time I saw him, we were diggin' in.
I saw him.
He had a horse.
I guarantee you, he's almost to Nogales by now.
What the hell are we gonna do now?
Load the train up.
We're still goin' in.
- Uh, hello. Buenos días.
- Buenos días.
¿ Verdugo aquí?
Well, is he here?
Grimes, I should have you shot.
What are you trying to do, become an adventurer?
Well, that's good, because the role does not suit you.
Tell me, Mr. Grimes... how did you happen to be with them in the first place?
I was taken at the point of a gun.
I was a prisoner.
- For so long?
- All right.
He did return... finally.
- You escaped, huh?
- Yes.
Uh-huh.
They're going to attack the town.
Really?
- How?
- They've taken the train.
Are you sure?
You saw it?
I heard the plans.
- There was nothing I could do.
- Of course not.
Look.
Let them come in.
And after they've gotten off the train... we can catch them in the streets.
Mr. Grimes, that would be an incredibly stupid thing to do.
First, you have them nicely trapped on the train... and then you allow them to get into the streets and houses?
Grimes... your train will be a small sacrifice to our cause.
- Go check up there... the machine gun.
- Yes, sir.
¡Alto!
¡ Fuego!
Sarita!
We did all right, didn't we?
Yeah, I guess we did.
I mean, we won, didn't we?
Well.
We won, huh?
Yep.
I think I can put the train back into running order. I thought you'd like to know that.
It'll take time, and I'll need men for the labor.
Yeah.
It's important that, uh... we know where we stand, huh?
What the hell for?
Well, look out there.
You're their leader now.
You should think about that.
- I ain't no dadgum such thing.
- They think you are.
They do?
This place is yours, and you have an army.
With them, you can control the entire area for good or bad.
You're ready to say no to that?
Damn right I am.
Oh, no, you're not.
A man like you... with your intelligence?
The whole state can be yours.
All of Sonora.
- No. Hell, no.
- You have to.
The choice isn't yours.
The decision's been taken out of your hands.
Do you know what'll happen if you walk away from all this? There'll be anarchy.
- What...
- These people...
Your people, they'll drift apart without a leader.
And then another general will come from Mexico City... with another army, and these streets'll run with blood again.
You'll need to move men and supplies.
You'll need the railroad.
I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
Lyedecker!
- Hey, you ain't leavin' are you?
- Yep.
You can't do that.
I mean, I ain't goin' with ya.
What are you gonna tell 'em?
What are you gonna say?
Well, I'll tell 'em I just didn't bring you back, Joe.
Of course, they'll be able to see that for themselves anyway, won't they?
Yeah, but you're the leader.
I mean, if you go, there could be anarchy.
There could be blood in the streets.
Look, Joe, they'll follow you now.
In fact, it could be a good deal for you.
Yeah, but, Lyedecker, what do you got to go back to?
You came down here with nothin', not even a job permanent.
- After all them years, nothin'.
- Yeah, I thought about that.
You did?
What'd you think?
I thought I oughta go back and give it one more shot.
Lyedecker, maybe
I oughta go back with ya.
You don't wanna do that, Joe.
You belong here, and I belong up north.
Like I said,
I wanna give it that one more shot.
And, Joe, good luck, amigo.
All right, dadgumit, let's get this dadgum army together!
All right!
All right!
Looks like farmland down there.
We stopping someplace? I got a shoe ain't lasting.
They'll all need attention before we head into that north range.
Talk about the tail end of nowhere.
Might be a sheepherder along that crick.
Norman, you and Earl see if you can locate a herder.
Find out what's ahead of us.
Today's the day Reverend
Broyles comes to town, Johnny.
- I didn't forget.
- Well, you better hurry.
He'll likely travel the cool of the day and be in about noon.
This will be the last one, boys.
You mean church day's coming in the middle of the week again?
Well, I'd just as soon hear a more respectful way of putting it, but the answer's yes.
Why can't Mr. Broyles come on Sundays...
...when we have to read the prayer book anyway?
Because he has to cover the whole county.
Can't be in a dozen different places the same day.
I'll leave you hitch the team while I wash up.
If Mr. Broyles doesn't come, do we still have to make believe it's a church day?
You know, you fellas just might not make out too well...
...on the day somebody says you either go up or you go down.
We like church better when you read us the prayer book on Sundays.
- You don't take so long to finish.
- Just hitch up the horses.
You know, I think I'm gonna make a start getting some early barley into the ground.
Talking to old man Collins the other day.
He thinks maybe the price gonna come back this year. on your way to town, you might see if
Dulcie could take some time to visit me.
All right. old Collins, he's got barley clear to the crick.
You might tell Dulcie to bring some things with her...
...in case she has to stay a day or two.
You know, the boys are gonna be a great help to me this year.
They just...
You mean, you want me to tell Dulcie because you're gonna ha...? You're gonna...?
Because you're...? It's time?
It's time, Johnny.
It's time?
If the doctor gets here on time, fine.
If he doesn't, I'll manage with Dulcie and Mrs. Sawyer.
Tell Dulcie to stop for Mrs. Sawyer.
The doctor said it'd be early. I don't want you to worry about it.
Not worry? Why, I can't forget what happened the last time. oh, Johnny, I feel so good. I know everything's gonna be all right.
Well, listen, I'll go into town, I'll get a good riding horse and go to Sweetwater.
- No, it's too late for all that.
- It's too late?
If the doctor's not on his way already, we'll manage without him.
I want you to take the boys into town for church.
Church? I'm not going to church. I'm gonna stay...
Now, the Reverend Broyles makes a long trip.
- We should have a fair attendance for him.
-  Henrietta...
Ask Mrs. Littlejohn to keep the boys for the night.
That'll be one worry off my mind.
And another will be you.
I want you to stay with the boys.
You know Dulcie would never stand for having you underfoot. oh, well, you know how much
I care what Dulcie stands for.
But we will be dependent on her, so we can't have quarrelling, can we?
You stay busy thinking up a name for our new daughter.
Sure prettying up herders these days, ain't they?
I'm just sitting. Sheep's Mr. Robbins'.
We lost our bearings, gal. Is there something up ahead you might call a town?
- Firecreek's all.
- Hey, girl.
That spitting distance or what?
About four miles, I reckon.
Long time since I seen a gal sprouting hair like that.
No need to get skittish, gal.
I'm old enough to be your grandpa.
Way he's been around, honey, don't lay no money he ain't.
Say, Norman. A scalp like this would be worth a horse or two in Sioux trading.
Can't be a young buck this whole valley worth his salt, a gal that skittish around.
What's going on here?
Come on up there, girl. Come on up.
- The girl got herself wet falling in, Bob.
-  I did not fall in.
- They was scaring me.
- That's all it was, just a little scared.
You have a dress there to pay for.
Sure. Sure thing, Bob.
Pretty dress for a pretty girl ain't never a waste of money, honey.
- I ain't never had no $5 before.
- Got it now, honey.
You're a pair of fools.
I don't suppose you took the time to find out if there's a town up ahead.
Yeah, place called
Firecreek. About four miles.
We'll water and rest the horses here in case we go right through.
She say she got scared, huh?
Ain't nothing like a dollar changing a female's way of thinking, Drew.
Yeah.
You ain't got no cause to beat me, Mama.
What barn you been rolling in?
I ain't been no place.
Just down to the crick.
- How did your dress get into that state?
- Just down at the crick, I fell in.
It's that Abbott boy. I seen him headed that way.
Mama, I swear, he wasn't nowhere...
Wasn't around. I told him you didn't want him fooling around me.
- What is that?
- Something I found.
That's how I fell in.
Seeing a gold piece in the crick shining up at me, grabbing for it.
I'll put it away for you.
I figured I'd be buying me a new dress with that there money, Mama.
You got enough dresses.
You get one on for church.
You boys stay here.
Morning, Dulcie. Well, it looks like it's time for Henrietta.
She was wondering if you and
Mrs. Sawyer would come over.
Henrietta in labor?
- I never asked her that.
- Could be a matter of some interest to you.
- Where are you and the boys staying?
- oh, at Miss Littlejohn's house.
Let Leah ride with you. Ask
Bertha if she can put her up too.
That's fine. That's fine. I'll do that.
I'll be at the Cobb farm tonight.
Now, you ride in with them and you stay with Bertha Littlejohn, you hear?
Yes, ma'am.
- Morning, Mr. Cobb.
- Morning, Leah.
- Got hay for the livery?
- Yeah, they're about out.
You smell like barber water.
Now, that's not very good manners, telling a lady she smells.
But she does.
Just bury me here.
We'll take an hour, no more.
Sure ain't no town we gotta hurry through.
Something to think about, Bob.
You resting in bed a little, maybe get that bleeding stopped.
Boarding house, place to eat up there, means they get a stage coming through.
There ain't gonna be one every day.
Wouldn't worry me none if it did.
I swear, you and dirt's getting less fussy about each other every day.
That's a horse trough.
Shoot.
You been told to keep your hands off me, boy.
Well, ain't you dirty now.
Come on, boy.
Had him in there a long time, Johnny.
Folks hereabouts might not like somebody drowning in their livery trough.
Well, I guess I'm saying it'd be better you let him up.
How'd you like to take his place?
Well, no, naturally, I wouldn't.
Man don't mind his own business...
Maybe you don't realize you're talking to our sheriff.
Now, you boys go and play until the preacher comes.
- And don't get too far.
- Yes, Pa.
Come on, Arthur, give me a hand here.
- Jail there, all right.
- Didn't figure on no law in a hundred miles.
Hold it down, Drew.
You think I'm gonna let him get away...?
- Sorry if my partners' fooling got to you.
- oh, sure.
We're just passing through.
Take it you're not a full-time sheriff, huh?
No.
What you might call an honorary position.
First time I ever heard of a farmer-sheriff before.
Johnny gets $2 every month for being sheriff.
Now, how about that.
Kind of slow in coming sometime too.
For a farm town, you got pretty good accommodations up the street.
Place to eat, rooms.
Well, it's the overnight stop for the Sweetwater stage.
It comes through every Saturday.
If I sound nosy, we may be bringing a herd up this way come spring.
Might put up here instead of Sweetwater.
Town's always glad to get business.
Two hours enough for you to check their shoes? oh, the regular livery man's away. He does the shoeing.
Johnny! I can do that, Johnny.
I've watched enough now.
All right, Arthur, you can do it.
Thank you, Johnny.
This town could really grow on you.
If he gets in trouble,
I'll take over for him.
What, did you hurt yourself or something?
My horse rolled, coming across the rocks. Feels like a cracked rib.
Well, the doctor from
Sweetwater's on his way here.
My missus is expecting. We're sort of hoping he gets here tonight.
Thanks. Be out of here by then.
Bob, no stage till Saturday...
...a sodbuster for a sheriff.
What's chasing us out?
Horses could use a rest, Bob.
- I say we stay the night.
- It ain't your say.
Well, I'll get a couple of hours' sleep and take a look at this.
Get some food in you.
We'll talk about it later.
Mr. Whittier!
How much is this dress?
Well, those... Those frilly ones, I'm asking $3, Leah.
If I bought it, could you trust me for a while?
I'll put it on your mother's account.
No, no. I mean trust me, personal.
Well, now, Leah, just how you going to hide a new dress from your mother?
Mr. Whittier, I am of age.
I can buy me a new dress.
We'll keep it between us.
I'll go change in the back.
You know what I'd like to do someday, Johnny?
- Raise horses.
- Well, no reason why you can't.
Yeah, but that'd take a heap of money to raise horses, wouldn't it, Johnny?
Well, save a little out of your pay every month, you'll find it mounts up.
Yeah. I'll have to do that. one thing you ought to stop doing, though...
...is keep buying things for people all the time.
I like to buy presents for people, Johnny.
Well, that's all very well and good, but the way to get a horse farm...
...is to put away a dollar for every dollar you spend.
See?
I'm always fooling myself.
I'm not smart enough to raise horses.
Well, I don't know, Arthur.
I don't know. I'd say if you did go out and get yourself some horse land...
...there would be a lot of people missing you.
- Missing me, Johnny?
- I know Mr. Edelman says...
...he doesn't know what he'd do without you helping him around here.
- Did he say that?
- Well, yeah, sure he did.
Johnny. Johnny, where are they from? Did they say?
- No, they didn't.
- You didn't even ask them?
No. I don't make it my business asking strangers where they're from.
You saw how they acted. I wouldn't be surprised but they were wanted someplace.
I don't see that's any of my business either.
Well, I think a close eye should be kept on them, Johnny.
- Now, I think you really ought to do that.
-  Mr. Hall.
I've got enough on my mind...
...without wondering about people passing through town.
Salutations, brethren.
The Almighty has given us a glorious day.
But, Johnny. Johnny...
Afternoon, Reverend.
Everything ready for you.
Bless you, Mr. Whittier.
- Afternoon, Reverend.
- Mr. Cobb, it's always my pleasure.
It's nice to see you looking well.
I wanted to ask, have you seen the doctor anywhere in your rounds?
Illness in town, Mr. Cobb?
Well, the doctor said he'd make it a point to get an early start...
...around the county this month, for my wife's sake. oh, yes, Mrs. Cobb.
I can tell you she hasn't got a worry in this mortal world, God bless her.
- Not a worry.
- Well, then the doctor's headed this way?
- Mr. Cobb, she's a
God-fearing woman. - Yes, sir.
Faith will sustain her. Services will begin promptly at 3:00.
You may assist me by informing those along the street, if you will. Mr. Whittier.
See how it spins, huh? Yeah.
Hey, girl, he's your babe?
Yes.
Mite lighter, ain't he?
You full-blooded?
Yes.
Kid ain't.
Hey, husband come along with the kid?
Hey, Indian. Now, he's talking to you.
No.
Town ain't been as quiet as it looks.
This may not heal a cracked rib bone, Mr. Larkin...
...but never heard of it hurting one, like they say.
Thank you.
Don't get many travelers in the middle of the week.
Just staying the night?
- Be riding on before dark.
- Your room is ready, Mr. Larkin.
Well...
...hope that gets you to sleep.
Sure help. Nice talking to you, Mr. Pittman.
This way.
- Your grandfather's quite a talker.
- He hasn't much else to do.
Hope it's not too much to ask...
...think you can find something
I could use for bandages?
Maybe some hot water.
I think so.
My, how pretty we look today.
You're kind, ma'am.
How's Henrietta, Johnny? I see she didn't come in with you.
She's fine. Well, I'm... I mean, this is her time, Miss Littlejohn.
Dulcie's out there with her now.
Anything I can do?
Well, there is one thing.
Henrietta wondered if you'd take care of the boys tonight.
Why, of course.
Dulcie mentioned maybe Leah wouldn't be too much trouble, either. oh, none of them are any bother.
I got room enough to rattle around in over there.
Put the boys up in the attic.
Extra bed there for you too.
Fine.
You'll have to be throwing a party, huh, Johnny? one they'll hear all the way to Sweetwater.
Whole damn town fits in a store...
...and still we gotta sleep in the hills tonight.
Bob plays it safe. Ain't nothing wrong with that.
There's a difference between playing it safe and being an old woman.
Earl, I'm coming more around to your way of thinking.
We could've cut over to Sweetwater...
...and had ourselves a real night's entertainment...
...before we hit the high country.
Plenty of time for that when we get the territory behind us.
Bob uses his head, and I'll stick with a thinking man.
This whole valley must be full of skittish gals.
No need to run, honey. You passed inspection real fine.
The food is on the stove.
Well, times have changed, grandpa.
Gal likes a little cooing first.
You just can't grab her like that.
My age, son, you gotta take shortcuts. Minutes count.
Here's hot water and bandages. I'd advise you to have that taken care of.
Miss?
- Is it "miss"?
- Yes.
I figure you wouldn't fall over in a dead faint...
...putting another bandage on me.
The amount of blood on that shirt shows you're carrying a bullet.
That calls for a doctor.
I managed some doctoring last night. The bullet's out.
How did it get there?
Wasn't a lawman, if that's concerning you.
You don't take after your grandfather much in the way of talking.
Not that I much complain when a woman keeps her mouth shut.
I find no complaint when a man does the same.
Here, I'll take him for a while.
Now, brethren, I ask you, does the Lord God have compassion? of course he does.
But should compassion be extended to those who knowingly defy?
To those who would...
How do they expect us to get our supplies with all that hollering going on?
- who walk hand in hand with Satan?
Sure does bring it up from the gut.
- the defilers, to the spoilers?
Yea, even the fires of hell...
...will not even the score of the transgressor.
He is a man doomed to eternal affliction.
A man who will kneel, bloody, in the dust of his creation.
A man who will scream the anguish of a pitiful soul...
...who has neglected the word of the Almighty when evil beckoned.
No man escapes...
Come in, come in.
No man escapes his day of reckoning.
To each falls an accounting.
Payment is demanded of ye, and payment will be made.
When he saith, "I cometh to be paid what is due my house"...
...the Lord God does not speak of...
There will be no drinking during services.
Well, you don't mind us, preacher, we don't mind you.
Drew. That's not bad for store-bought whiskey.
It's been the town custom to close the store when we have church.
Appreciate you fellows waiting a bit.
Well, what happens if a man needs supplies in a hurry?
Well, that never came up before.
Well, it's come up now.
We can wait.
Now, maybe a man or two here thinks the Book of Judgment don't apply.
That he can take pleasures in falsehoods...
...pleasures in exploiting his brother's sorrows.
Well, to him comes damnation a thousandfold.
To him comes the devil's branding irons, heated to his tortured flesh.
Yea, there are some who will suffer the eternal desert...
...the eternal thirst of the unbeliever.
Whither goest thou? What trail?
What road? What awaits ye?
The fires of hell. The burning pit.
Ye say not for you.
From corruption given, corruption will be received.
What mockery have ye traded for his word?
What part of thy soul have ye traded for damnation?
- Shut up.
- Well...
You been staring straight at me.
Well, I ain't asking for no preaching.
I have stirred thee, friend. It was my intention.
Well, being so smart, your stirring's over.
Meaning your cat-howling.
Meaning this church.
Now, it may be, mister, you don't like the sermon.
A lot of people in this town don't come to hear it...
...and Mr. Broyles would be the first to tell you...
...he doesn't get 100 percent attention.
But all these people here have come to listen to the preacher...
...and anybody doesn't like what he has to say can leave.
Sure a mouthful for a sodbuster.
You're forgetting again, you're talking to our sheriff.
Wasn't talking to you, limp-brain.
I think, mister, you better leave.
We can get our supplies later.
Sit down.
I have no animosity for thee, friend. Go with my blessing.
Johnny. Johnny, I think you ought to tell those fellas to move on.
You don't tell somebody to leave town because he's got bad manners.
Well, where are those men from? Where they heading?
Those questions should be asked.
Miss Littlejohn, where these men are from...
...and where they're headed is none of my business.
I think we'd better get on with the services here.
Maybe a good hymn or two will clear the air.
Suppose we try "Rock of Ages," page 11.
I thank you, Miss Evelyn.
I'm gonna be feeling a lot better going on.
I don't see how you're going to ride with that.
Some things you just do.
You're missing church.
It's not the first time.
Before, when I was asleep, you were watching me.
- You reminded me of somebody.
- Who?
That's not important.
I usually figure my women. You come harder.
I'm not your women.
Just wasn't making any sense to me...
...somebody like you winding up in this cemetery of a town.
Thanks again for the bandaging.
Franklin, look.
- My utmost thanks to you, Mr. Whittier.
- Reverend.
And if you'll kindly relay my regards to Mrs. Cobb.
Thank you, sir.
Well, where you headed now, Reverend?
I'll do some visiting through the foothills.
Maybe get a little marrying done among those trappers...
...least the ones that don't see me coming.
I guess they'd scatter at that.
Kind of free souls up there, huh?
There is no such thing as a free soul, Mr. Cobb.
The expression never sits with me.
We are the Lord's children, bound to follow.
I might have used a better choice of words.
The next time out, I'd like you to stop off the night with me and Henrietta.
Supper and a soft bed instead of you being on the trail all the time.
That's an invitation, Mr.
Cobb, I'll hold in mind.
- Good day, Reverend.
- Good day.
We saw Buffalo Bill doing that.
He came to Sweetwater in a circus.
He ever do anything like this?
Reverend. Reverend, are you hurt? Are you hurt?
No.
Well, I've sure done some fool things in my time...
...but that takes the cake.
The young'uns got to talking about trick shooting...
...and I kind of got carried away.
Sure hope you have a forgiving nature, preacher.
I think you did that on purpose.
Miss Littlejohn, why don't you take the boys down to the house.
Children.
Mister, why did you fire that gun?
I told you, sheriff. Boy wanted to see some trick shooting.
Sure hope you're accepting my apologies, Mr. Preacher.
No harm done, Mr. Cobb.
Well, that's real generous of you, Mr. Preacher.
Sure wouldn't do me no good, you being mad at me.
- Sure you're all right, Reverend?
- Yeah.
Here, I'll help you.
How you making it, Bob?
What am I supposed to do, keep a rein on you 24 hours a day?
Town's real friendly, Bob. No problems.
We kind of talked it over among ourselves...
...and we decided maybe we could leave early in the morning.
I'll go along with them on that, Bob.
Couldn't be no better place for staying.
Pull out tomorrow with the horses rested and you feeling a lot better.
- All right.
- We do anything for you?
Keep away from that farmer.
Johnny. Johnny, I just been telling Arthur here...
...you could maybe arrest those men and put them in jail.
Arrest them for what? on suspicion they're wanted someplace.
Now, if you put them in jail...
...you could send somebody to
Sweetwater for the marshal there.
You talk like I was the regular sheriff of this town.
I'm a farmer with a family to take care of.
And what's more, I got a wife that's pregnant...
...and maybe gonna have a hard time of it.
We'd feel better if you stayed in town, Johnny.
I'm gonna stay in town.
Look, Johnny, if you're worried about Henrietta...
...I can go out to the farm and stand by for you...
...and then drive into town as soon as anything happens.
Well, now, you have an idea there, you know.
That Dulcie, she objects to having a husband around...
...and it'd be a great help to me if you'd go out there, Mr. Hall.
Well, I'll go and lock up my shop now.
You need any help any time with those men, Johnny, you just tell me.
Well, nothing to worry about now, Arthur.
Why don't you see about shoeing these horses.
Well, don't you forget. I'm your deputy.
You forgot. oh, no. No, no, I didn't forget.
No, I didn't forget, Arthur. If I need your help, I'll call on you.
I'll call on you.
Just ain't proper.
What ain't proper, grandpa?
Girl wasting all that energy on them windows...
...me over here in a fix.
She'd beat you down without even half trying.
Your lack of faith disturbs me, boy.
What's going on?
Looks like whatever goes on in this town...
...goes on in that back room.
I haven't dropped by in a few days.
You know I don't mind.
There'd been talk, I guess you noticed that.
How's Henrietta?
Well, it's maybe like before, a long time in happening.
Meli, we managed it wrong.
You coming to town, me saying nothing.
Sometimes silence is best.
No, no, we just managed it wrong.
Talk will stop when I'm gone.
No, but that's another thing. It's driving you away from this town.
Johnny, but for you bringing me here, there was nowhere I could have gone.
And now I have earned enough money to settle in another town.
And I am grateful.
Going to another town isn't the answer...
...like going to your village wasn't the answer.
Meli, I want you to stay in Firecreek...
...and I want us to say something, bring it out in the open...
...like I wanted to do when you came.
Johnny, it's too late now.
- People will think that...
- Maybe I don't care what they think.
You must care.
This is your home.
Why are you so nervous, Mr. Hall?
Nervous? Well, this is a kind of a nervous thing, this having a baby.
Your first?
That's a joke, Mr. Hall.
Why don't you just go outside and make yourself comfortable...
...and we'll call you if we need you.
Everything's gonna be all right in there, isn't it?
Well, if it isn't, you'll be just about as helpful...
...as that doctor who seems to be on the other side of the county.
Dulcie, you've no patience with the menfolk.
Well, they come in all sizes, Miss Sawyer...
...but I've yet to find one that's worth a woman's patience.
Arthur. You finished with your work?
Johnny's finishing for me.
Said he had nothing to do.
- There's some root beer inside...
- Mr. Whittier?
You think that something bad is gonna happen?
You worry too much about what you hear said, Arthur.
Well...
...it'll be night soon...
...and that's when things happen.
Yes?
Did you want anything?
If you're any good at small talk, it always manages to bore me to sleep.
Seriously, if you've got nothing better to do...
...sit down.
Strange feeling, lying here.
Like I've suddenly been left naked.
No defenses.
I imagine it's a natural feeling every wounded man has.
Especially if somebody's following.
Who said there's anybody following?
It's obvious you and your men are hired killers...
...down from the northern range wars.
We work in the open.
Eat and drink with the ranchers who hire us.
As much respected as anybody in the country.
Don't quibble any fine line with me, Mr. Larkin.
You're as dishonest as any common road bandit.
I'm not ashamed of the part I play.
There's not a territorial border we cross where men aren't waiting...
...hoping I can take them on...
...waiting to call themselves Larkin men.
You're admitting your only importance...
...is collecting men who don't care whether they live or die.
Who only live for the moment.
It's been a long road to make a name men will follow.
You'll get no apology from me.
It won't be long before you'll be running out of borders.
You'll come full circle against the law that made you move on.
You tie me up pretty good, Evelyn.
Why fight against times changing?
Why not join in changing them?
Then I'll be like all the rest.
Today I'm one of a few. I lead. That's important to me.
Earlier, you said I reminded you of somebody.
He was a wagon scout.
Killed in the same Indian raid that crippled my grandfather.
He mean something to you?
We were good friends.
How long ago he die?
Ten years.
And you've buried yourself in this town ever since.
I object to the word "buried. " object away.
You're living further in the past than I am.
- All right, toro.
- I'm mean.
You're all right.
Easy, toro. Easy, toro, toro, toro. oh, matador.
Easy, toro. Easy, toro.
Easy. You ready, toro?
Come on there, killer.
There, now. Put some of that in you.
Hey, give me another one of these.
Now, get all that glass out of there.
Well, that's your stupid trick, sticking that dumb head of yours through that window.
- That could've cut me.
- Wouldn't have hurt you.
You're pulling my hair.
- Hey, Drew.
- What?
Your turn to ante up.
Hey, Rodriguez.
Five dollars take care of that window?
- I thank you.
- one thing about us boys...
...we always like to keep everybody happy.
- Keep them happy.
- A little old dress paid for.
- Paid for.
- Little old window paid for.
- Paid for.
- Well, pay the man...
...the $5 for breaking his window.
- There you go.
Sorry we couldn't leave it on better terms this afternoon, sheriff...
...but that preacher, he did... He give me a wrong rub.
It'd be my pleasure and honor to buy you a drink and kind of let the bygones go.
Well, I just come over to ask you fellas kind of hold it down a bit.
- The noise, I mean.
- The noise.
Say, sheriff, you got a little one coming along, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, come on, Gomez...
...pour the man a drink.
Unless you mind the likes of us drinking to your kid's health.
I wouldn't blame him none if he did.
We're bums. Bums. Just bums.
Well, no, I appreciate the toast, naturally.
You're all right, sheriff.
Kind of man I'd like to ride...
I'd like to ride with. Now, what do we have?
Hey, Drew.
- What is that?
- He got a badge with the job.
Well, naturally, a sheriff has to have a badge.
It's not exactly a badge, it's...
Well, no, I shouldn't say that. It's...
That's a badge?
Well, my boys kind of hammered it out for me.
I ain't never seen anything like that.
- Mind your manners.
- Look how they spelled that.
I said, mind your manners.
Look how that's spelled.
Norman...
...that spells "sheriff. "
But look how it's written on there.
Well, their schooling hadn't gone very far, time they made it.
Right smart badge, sheriff.
You got youngsters to be proud of.
Well, I sure am proud.
I am proud.
It's about their bedtime. I'd better get over there and say good night to them.
Say, glad we're leaving on good terms, sheriff.
I mean, I hate leaving a man I like.
You know, I mean, him not thinking well of me and all.
Well, I'd appreciate you fellas kind of taking it easy...
...so the town won't be disturbed.
We're your boys.
Get that hair down, Pancho.
- Everything all right, Johnny?
- It's all right, it's all right.
- They're getting mean...
- They'll be gone soon, Arthur.
Why don't you go to bed and get some sleep.
She sure got a way of making a man ache.
Well, we could draw straws, see who says hello first.
Well, I never heard of anyone getting to sleep on a windowsill.
We were watching Arthur, Pa.
That's not too polite, you know.
Watching a fella without him knowing it.
Franklin said Arthur took the town's name because he forgot his own.
Yeah, I guess that's the way it happened.
How can anybody forget their last name?
Because some people just don't have good memories, that's all.
But Firecreek's a funny name to pick.
No, you say it together...
...it sounds kind of nice.
Arthur Firecreek, Arthur
Firecreek, Arthur Firecreek.
Pa, will you finish the story you started last night?
Will the new baby be born when we get home tomorrow?
Well, that's possible. But, anything starts to happen...
...Mr. Hall's out there and he'll come let us know.
We're hoping it's a baby brother, not a girl.
Well, I'd say a sister wouldn't be all that bad.
But you can't play with girls.
That's true.
That's true, that would be a drawback.
Well, does anybody remember where I was in the story?
I remember. The nesters were putting up mud huts...
...and Sam Bass was hired by the bad rancher to get them off.
He rode out and was gonna burn their crops.
They wouldn't have anything to eat...
...and they all worried about not having anything to eat.
Well, then, this...
Among these nesters was this family...
...and they had two boys about your age, and...
Meli?
Meli!
Meli!
Now, you get back to your livery, stable boy.
You stop hurting Meli!
Now, you show yourself around here again, boy...
...you're gonna get more of the same.
You ain't going back.
Just a minute, boy.
Don't take but a hair on that trigger.
You're gonna stand right there...
There ain't nothing we can do for him now. old limp-brain shot him, huh?
I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.
Johnny.
I didn't mean to do it, Johnny.
How do you not mean to shoot a man in the back?
- And with his own gun.
- Just what happened, Arthur?
I ain't never shot a gun before, Johnny.
- What was going on?
- He was hurting Meli.
That's all I was trying to do,
Johnny. I was just trying to stop him.
Can you tell us what happened, Meli?
He forced his way into my bedroom.
Now, wait a minute.
Who's talking for Drew?
I mean, who's saying he wasn't invited?
I'll say that, mister.
I don't see what this argument's got to do...
...with putting a bullet in a man's back.
- I ain't never shot a gun before.
- You sure made out the first time, boy.
You go on inside, Meli.
Well, this is something for the Sweetwater judge.
A judge?
Mister, where I come from, this calls for a rope.
Now, you just hold on.
If anything, there's been an accident here.
That boy would never shoot anybody.
Then what's your decision?
Well, the Sweetwater judge. He can ask questions, get the proper answers.
We can have him in here by the first of next week.
You expecting us to wait around here a week to testify, mister?
- Come on, Arthur.
- Where, Johnny?
You come on with me. I gotta put you in jail.
In jail? I...
Now, you come on.
You couldn't do some quiet drinking and get some sleep. oh, now, you gotta be fair, Bob.
Drew didn't figure on no fuss being made over a squaw. None of us did.
Never mind that Indian squaw, we always say we take care of our own.
Now, Drew's dying needs taking care of.
He was shot by a stable boy who couldn't tell you what day it is.
He got it in the back, is what counts.
Now, we've been your men, Bob...
...but maybe we'll start voting on what gets done around here.
When did you ever show enough brains to vote on what gets done?
I was just trying to help her,
Johnny. If somebody's getting hurt...
...that's what you do, try to help.
I know, Arthur. I'm really putting you in here for your own protection.
Well, why ain't they in here instead, Johnny? Those men. or maybe make them leave town.
Well, it just...
It isn't exactly a case of right or wrong, Arthur.
You see, sometimes a fellow just has to kind of step back...
...and wait a little time.
I don't understand, Johnny.
I don't even know whether I've the right to put you in jail...
...let alone go out and arrest somebody else.
I don't even know why I'm in town.
This whole thing is as much my business as...
All right, everybody out here!
Come out and say goodbye to Drew.
Did you hear that, boys?
All right, everybody get out here!
Well, now we're gonna have a little party, pop.
All right, everybody out here!
You hear? Come on out here, now.
All right, everybody's gonna get out here and say goodbye to Drew, now.
Everybody out, you hear?
Come out, now. You hear me? Everybody out here!
All right, everybody out.
Barkeep! Take the whiskey out here, pronto.
Come on, everybody, get out here!
Now, you folks just sit down. Make yourself at home.
Just have a seat.
Everybody out, you hear?
Come on out. Everybody get out here!
Come on, now, everybody get out here. Come out, you hear?
What's going on?
Just an old-fashioned wake.
Hey, you play this thing, pops?
- Wouldn't be up to it.
- I didn't think so.
Ten dollars to anybody can play this thing!
Who wants to make $ 10?
Mister! You wanna make $ 10?
All right, y'all get out here. Let's don't find anybody hiding under a bed.
Stop your bellering.
Well, sorry, Bob. Kind of forgot myself.
All right, you folks, come on down here and sit down.
Come right on down.
Guess you'd have no objection to how we bury our own.
Come have a seat. We're gonna get some service.
That's right. You just head up the street with all those nice people.
Well, now...
...if it ain't old Five-Dollar Nellie.
- My name's Leah.
- That's just a joke, honey.
You wearing that pretty dress for me?
- You like it?
- Yeah, I like it, along with what's inside it.
- You go to your room and stay.
- Now, ma'am, I said everybody.
I ain't going no place but where
I want, and you can't make me.
You're to stay in the house, Leah.
Mr. Cobb, I don't mind seeing a burial, I truly don't.
Get back in there.
Sheriff, the little gal just wanted to pay her respects to the dead, that's all.
Miss Littlejohn, you don't have to be out here either. oh, it's all right, Johnny. There should be some of us attending.
We got a lot of old people in this town...
...it'll be up to them, and not you, whether they want to be at a wake.
Well, seems you and me come abutting heads
- on.
Now, you gotta understand, sheriff...
...we got a religious way of doing things when we lose a man...
...and I'll appreciate you respecting that.
Come on down here. Come right on down.
Sit down, folks.
Come on down and have a seat.
Gotta keep the guest of honor happy, folks.
You just hoot out if you want it louder, old buddy.
It's disturbing where I stand.
I got a good mind to put a stop to this.
That might cause trouble.
But me being called sheriff and having all this go on...
Well, now, maybe...
...what's going on isn't even any of your business.
Look, I don't think anything's happening worth you getting hurt over.
In the morning, they'll be gone.
Everything creeping along the way it was before.
Everybody protecting his own little world.
I don't understand what you mean, Mr. Whittier.
What regard, Johnny?
Well, you sound like nothing mattered, if I heard you right.
Just unimportance, Johnny. Nothing important.
The town, the valley.
See, I'm old enough to have learned, Johnny...
...nothing ever stands still.
You grow or you die.
And a town that collects losers...
...will exist for their lifetimes, no more.
Losers?
Losers. Yes, Johnny.
Take Arthur, poor simpleton that he is.
Six years ago he drifted in here, not even knowing what his last name was.
But he still had the mental capacity...
...to recognize a town that he wouldn't have to compete in.
You know, I once practiced law.
Haven't you ever wondered why I came to these parts?
Well, you said it was your health.
Well, peace of mind is also a man's health.
I found myself unable to cope with making important decisions...
...so I came to Firecreek because
I could live out each day here...
...without my word having any import.
I'm no different from all the rest of them...
...no different at all, Johnny.
Look. Just look at them out there.
They're frightened because of something new and strange in town.
Disturbed because today didn't turn out like yesterday.
Let it go, Johnny.
Let it go.
But we've got more than that here, Mr. Whittier.
We've got to have more than that.
- We...
- Johnny! Johnny. Johnny.
Johnny!
- It's bad, Johnny, real bad.
- What happened?
I don't know. It's just bad.
Henrietta, she's screaming.
Let me in there.
How we leaving here,
Bob? our tails tucked in?
We leave here like we leave every other place...
...swinging high and wide.
Looks like it's gonna be a busy night.
Well, now, how's the little girl...
...I'm liable to bundle off to St.
Joe before she even thinks of it?
- Some dancing left?
- Honey, it ain't only left...
...but Drew's liable to come raring out of that chair plain jealous.
I hope you won't be leaving too early tomorrow.
We'll be leaving, honey, but not too early.
Got some unfinished business.
Come on, girl.
Kind of pride ourselves we leave no business unfinished.
That right, Bob?
Get out.
- You're not sleeping.
- Naturally I'm not.
May I come in?
You're humiliating this town.
It's nothing I want.
I thought you placed such great importance on leading.
Your so-called...
...town sheriff and me...
...are quite a bit alike.
How do you see that?
We're both riding a greased pig. Nothing to hold on.
I don't know what's going through his mind...
...but in my case, I'm not expected...
...to leave behind one of my men with a bullet in his back.
And you placate these animals you call men?
Certain things are expected of me.
Well, why not do the unexpected? Ride on alone.
You don't need these killers.
Maybe I've been alone, didn't like it.
Maybe I don't have your temperament to accept another empty day.
That's insulting.
Then you do have something left.
You know, Evelyn...
...I've known a lot of women.
Been with a lot.
Is that supposed to excite me?
No, no. I'm trying to explain.
I never loved any.
I kept thinking the craziest thing out there...
...like I'd be coming back this way.
I don't know when.
I can't gamble with being nobody.
I've been that.
It doesn't work for me.
It's a false labor. Same trouble as with your youngest.
Henrietta.
Johnny.
I'm glad you came.
- I should have gone over to Sweetwater.
- No.
I'm gonna be all right.
I was dreaming of our wedding day.
Remember, Johnny?
Held up the wagon train for a whole hour.
You were so shy.
So handsome.
Just plain everyday scared, that's...
But in my dream, we didn't pull out of the wagon train.
We went on to oregon, the way we'd first planned.
I saw everything so clear.
There was land up there as far as we could see. our land.
Land for our sons.
You remember how it was, Johnny?
The things we talked about?
I remember.
So adventurous, so exciting.
There was nothing we couldn't do, nothing, the two of us together. oh, Johnny.
Why didn't we go on?
Why did we settle for less than we wanted?
Johnny, hold my hand.
Don't go away.
Hold tight.
Stay with me, Johnny.
Dulcie.
I've got to get back to town.
Well, there's obviously nothing holding you here.
There are some men in town...
...and I just feel it's better if I'd be there.
I said that there was nothing holding you here.
I've got to get in there.
If I just felt that she'd be all right...
Henrietta's my whole life, Dulcie.
Now, leaving here, I'd...
If I just... If I just knew that she...
Her worst time was last night. She'll do all right now.
Johnny?
Hold my hand.
How could you let it happen?
How could you let it happen?
Well, you were all here.
How could you let it happen?!
They had no choice.
We didn't bother running.
No reason to run.
Where you find no law, you set your own.
We tried him, found him guilty.
Maybe nobody can keep you from leaving this town, but I'm following.
I'm following, and when we get to a marshal...
...I'm gonna charge you with murder.
Wherever you go, Larkin, I'm following...
...and I'm gonna watch all four of you hang!
Little worrying over that leg will slow you down.
Still owe shoeing money.
Guess $5 ought to cover it.
Ain't nothing $5 won't take care of in this town.
Mr. Whittier. Mr...
Mr. Whittier, you've got a handgun here. I'll take it.
- Give it up, Johnny. It'd be a losing game.
- Come on. Come on, I want that gun.
It's not your fight. It's not your business, Johnny.
And that's what I've been telling myself ever since they rode in here.
Well, it was my business, Mr. Whittier.
The Larkins of this world are everybody's business.
And they won't disappear just by turning your head or stepping back.
That boy's dead because I didn't take a stand with them in the beginning.
I'm not watching you get yourself killed by those men.
You say this is a town of losers.
How could you say Arthur is a loser?
He fought back and didn't have anything to fight back with.
Now... Now, me, a loser...
...well, that's something else again.
No, I'll agree with you there.
The day I crossed this valley...
...you had the biggest loser of all time settling right here.
Do you know what I saw in this place I was willing to call my home?
- I'm not giving you that gun, Johnny!
- Listen to me!
I had my whole life ahead of me.
And all I saw here was land that nobody wanted...
...and ground that nobody would be challenging me for.
I saw too many people die fighting over land.
This wasn't gonna happen to me. Not to Johnny Cobb.
Johnny Cobb had the answer.
Search for a place where there are no bruises...
...and tie it up with a ribbon...
...and tell yourself that what's inside is the sum total of your life.
And what I didn't see was the day a man decides not to face the world...
...is the day he better step out of it!
Now, give me the gun!
Mangy cur.
And that Indian girl across the street and that child of hers.
That child belonged to my dead brother.
Got to be a habit, not taking a stand.
Easier all the time.
Wouldn't admit that a half-breed was a Cobb.
Bottom shelf, Johnny.
They can't exist in this world, Mr. Whittier. once people take a stand, there won't be any place for the Larkins to hide.
Henrietta said we settled for a lot less here. Well, maybe we did.
Maybe we did.
But I'm fighting for my home.
And I'm fighting for my boys taking over someday...
...and making the name Firecreek heard...
...and making this valley a place we got some pride in.
And I just don't think I'm gonna be apologizing for wearing this.
That's a lesson I learned long ago.
A man worth shooting's a man worth killing.
Spread out, go in fast.
Nothing.
He's got an advantage, knowing the town.
Well, I'm kind of getting fed up with this sodbuster.
All right, Cobb, we'll settle for a standoff.
We leave, you go for a marshal.
We'll take our chances on the trail.
Got that backed up with a hole card, Cobb.
You agree, or we burn the town.
If I had the use of my legs for
10 minutes and a gun in my hand...
Time for him to show some sense.
You cut out along the back, to the livery.
You don't hear from Cobb, put a match to it.
Cobb, this whole town goes up like a prairie fire.
Won't be anything left.
Johnny should say something.
Your time's run out, Cobb.
Put it out.
Put that match out.
Why not give a little, take a little, sheriff?
Now unbuckle your gun belt.
I mean, you step back, we'll do the same.
Unbuckle it.
What's the matter, sheriff? You nervous?
That's right, I'm nervous.
All right.
Sure can't agree with your thinking about...
You know better than to go to a man who's expecting you.
Bob. Bob.
Bob. Bob.
We'll start moving around...
...once he takes to worrying about where we are, what we might be doing.
We'll wait.
I ain't gonna wait, Bob.
I think he's around that livery, and that's all I need to know.
- Pa!
- Pa!
Larkin!
Cobb!
Drop it, Cobb, it's all over.
I said, it's all over.
Drop it and you'll live. I'll ride out.
What are you proving?
Two dollars a month, a homemade badge.
You've got no business laying your life on the line.
Johnny.
Johnny.
Pa!
Pa!

Are you feeling sick or anything?
There's a fella here got a cross with your name on it and today's date.
You hear that?
Come on, now. You've had enough.
That man's out to get you.
Something important?
Maybe he'll tell you.
Looking for me?
Are you Sam Hawkins?
Yeah, sure. What about it?
It's you I was lookin' for.
Catch it!
Yeehaw!
Come on. Pick it up.
Throw it back, will ya?
How's about a little wager?

All right, Ross.
I'll bet on the kid.
I got $100 on you!
Yeehaw!
Hurry up there!
Hurry UP!
Get rid of it!
Get it out!
What's he doing there?
Hurry up!
It's gonna blow any minute.
- What's the matter with that guy?
- Get goin'!
Yeehaw!
You win the bet.
You win, Rod.
Here's your $100.
Can't beat you at any game.
Come on, dear.
Ma'am.
The rent?
But before you go, we have to find a date to settle our accounts.
Naturally.
Any time you like.
Perhaps we can get it over with this evening if you're planning to be at home.
All right, Rod.
I'll be waiting for you.
Giddy up.
Um...
That brother of yours never loses a bet, does he?
What do you charge for makin' a cross?
One dollar.
Then make me one.
And the date?
Today.
What about the name?
Howard Ross.
Ah.
You can have it for free, in that case.
This covers half of the mortgage and the interest.
You get the final payment next year.
You'd be surprised to know who I saw today.
Django.
Mm.
Pretty.
Extremely pretty.
I hope you'll be able to keep up with your payments, Ross.
Ma'am.
How revolting.
Try and forget him.
You don't think he really meant that bit about Django, do you?
Hmm.
Not unless it was one of his nightmares.
Don't work too late.
Figuring out how rich you are,
Howard?
You. He wasn't joking.
Django, glad to see you.
So was your friend.
Sam Hawkins.
Yeah.
I heard about that.
I want to tell you something, Django.
Nothin'.
Don't say nothin'.
No, listen, Django.
Let me explain.
It wasn't the way you think.
I... I didn't do anything.
Django.
Django!
Where are you?
Listen, Django...
Django.
I'm here, Howard.
Wait a minute.
Hey.
Where are you?
Django.
Please listen.
I'll explain it all.
Listen.
You must listen!
Don't go away, Django.
Why won't you listen to me?
It wasn't my fault.
I didn't do anything.
I'm innocent, I tell you.
Innocent!
I'm over here, Howard.
I'm waitin' for ya.
No!
No!
No!
Your time has come, Ross Howard.
You're dead.
You're dead!
Leave me alone, Django!
You're dead!
And when was this?
The same evening, Mr. Murdok.
It must have been just a little while after you left.
It was just like it happened to Hawkins.
There was a cross with his name on it and the date.
Then it was him after all.
All right, thanks.
Django.
Brett! William!
Brett!
Here's $5,000.
That's to pay Mrs. Howard for the herd.
But maybe Widow Howard doesn't wanna sell her cattle, Major, sir.
Don't worry, William.
She'll sell, all right.
Now that her husband's been killed, the ranch'll be too much for her.
You won't have to pay more than $5 a head.
Here, Brett. Go find me 20 men who aren't afraid of using their guns.
Mm.
Oh, and, Brett... bring them all to Desert City as soon as possible.
I'll join you there.
All right, Mr. Murdok.
What are you doing?
Why aren't you in bed?
With him?
You got any complaint?
That brother of yours is crazy.
Crazy. I don't know why
I agreed to marry him.
You know perfectly well why you married him, my dear.
Because you're a greedy little tramp who's ready to do anything where there's money in it.
And don't forget that my brother and I come from one of the best families in the whole of this country.
That's true. And I can hardly wait for the moment when everyone finds out what you and your brother are really like.
That reminds me of the rest of our bargain.
In return for marrying that idiot, you agreed to give me a cash payment.
Hey! Howdy, folks!
Hi, girls.
Old Uncle William is back again.
The kids who love to kiss him back.
How are you?
Hey, boss, wait a minute.
Has Widow Howard agreed to sell the cattle?
Oh, that stupid woman.
I think she wants us to make her a higher bid because she says she has to think about it.
Ooh, you're looking pretty tonight.
No, not my champagne.
It's imported from the East.
For a very dear friend.
I want a drink.
That's for me, Erica.
Hey.
- Hey.
- No. Where are you going?
Aw, Willie. Where ya going?
Hey, how long's the widow wanna think?
Well, I hope it'll be as long as possible.
Well, I guess we can get in a couple of more hands, huh?
Jeez.
Hey, look what I brought for you, angel.
Oh, thanks.
Ooh, I could eat you.
Careful. I've a heart.
And a bottle of champagne.
Oh, all right, dear.
Why don't you go and open it while I go and change?
All right, but don't be too long.
Ah. Hmm.
Ah.
♪ La, Ia, Ia ♪
Ah...
Thanks.
Real thoughtful of you to provide a nice, cool drink.
Mighty fine.
Ain't you drinkin'?
This ain't no use to you.
Widow Howard has sold the herd.
You don't have to worry.
I'll leave you half of the money.
And the other half?
Tell your boss that...
That I'll bring it along tomorrow.
Uh, wait a minute.
Stranger, please.
Tell me, who are you, anyway?
A devil... from Hell.
You're lucky you won't ever see me again.
Hold it, stranger.
Don't worry. I'll handle it.
Now turn around.
Seems we just heard a mighty funny story about you, stranger.
Yeah, mighty funny.
Seems you like tearing up dollars, and you done it with some money of his.
You mean this?
Better hand that right back, stranger.
Don't try anything.
You haven't got a chance.
Just hand it back quietly.
I already told you, William, what I'll do with the rest of the money.
I said I'm gonna deliver it.
What's up, Brett? Why all this rushing?
Here's a thousand bucks on account, Roland.
I want you and your men to do a little job, and I want it done good.
There's a thousand per head, Roland.
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow at Desert City.
Well, fellas, did you hear that?
There's a thousand dollars each waiting for us.
Rotten Murdok.
That snake.
What a gentleman he is.
Sure, he paid me the money he owed me.
Then he left me alone with these five hired killers.
Hey, just a minute.
The way Murdok cleared out of here, you'd think the Devil was after him.
These coyotes stole all my money.
To while away the time. Hey!
Django, I gotta get my money!
Wait a minute.
This money's mine.
I almost suffocated.
I would have too, if you'd been a few minutes later.
You're his wife, aren't you?
Luke Murdok's, right?
Hyah!
Hyah!
Ha!
I'll teach you...
Hyah! Ha!
Hyah!
Hey, who is that boy over there?
That's Luke Murdok, that is.
I reckon that's taught you some manners.
Hmm.
Come on.
That fella's lookin' for trouble.
Look here, Sheriff.
You certainly have to do something.
You sure do.
Our wives are afraid to go out alone even in daylight.
He's right, Sheriff.
This town's being taken over by a bunch of hired killers and gunmen.
Those fellas don't behave because they ain't afraid enough of you, Sheriff.
And besides, they all got the support of a man they came to work for... Murdok.
He says he needs protection.
He says he's afraid of bein' murdered.
That's what we have a sheriff for.
He can't take the law in his own hands.
Just 'cause he's the richest man in the territory.
As mayor of this here town,
I think it's your duty to get rid of these outlaws.
Or we'll give someone else your job.
If I was a younger man,
I'd sure teach them manners.
Get rid of him.
And no smart remarks.
- What did your brother say?
- Ha.
Now, Mr. Luke, you know what he said.
I wanna know who it was killed that fella,
Mr. Murdok.
Sheriff, did you say something?
You know what I said, Murdok.
And you're gonna answer me.
'Cause here in Desert City
I represent law and order.
- Did you hear that?
- You sure do.
- Why don't you leave us alone?
- Clear out of town.
Yeah.
Fools. Fools!
Law and order's through!
Finished! I've killed it!
Your tough sheriff is dead now!
Fools! Fools! Fools!
Run for your lives, you fools!
Fools! Run!
Hurry with that rag.
Hold still.
Hold still.
Don't struggle like that, Mr. Luke.
Hold still, darn you!
He won't calm down.
There's only one way.
If you can help him, go on.
How did you get away from my men?
Your men, huh?
They're dead, all of 'em.
Leave us alone.
Don't worry, Luke.
I'll look after you.
Well, Desert City is still about four hours' ride.
I promised Brett we would get there as soon as we possibly could.
Is it a bank?
Can't you get it through your heads?
This time it's honest work!
Mm-mm. Honest work?
Then why call on us?
Vámonos. Let's go.
If I heard right, that there was a trap closin'.
Maybe we found our dinner.
Come on!
Hey! We ain't got time for that.
Crazy fools.
Watch your step.
There may be others.
There it is.
Oh. Whatever it was got away.
All right, let's go.
We've got to be moving.
Why can't we look for it, huh?
Whatever it was lost a lot of blood,
I reckon.
No!
No! No!
No! No, don't shoot!
November 17th.
But that's tomorrow.
If I get my hands on the fella who did this...
We have to find him, Brett.
Could have been any one of your enemies, Mr. Murdok.
You've got plenty.
No one asked your opinion.
Just find him.
But how will I recognize him, huh?
I reckon if you're ever face to face, the two of you, you'll know he's your man.
Those men you hired, is everybody here?
The ones that haven't arrived yet, they'll be here as soon as possible.
Fine.
Sure ain't a very friendly town, this.
- Whiskey.
- Whiskey's all right, though.
Ought to be for what it costs.
That's because he makes it himself.
Come on, you fellas.
Mr. Murdok's got trouble.
A practical joker.
Last practical joker we had here got himself tarred and feathered.
Then it looks like we can count on having a little fun.
- Who is he?
- I don't know.
- Where do we find him?
- I don't know nothin'.
Only that he's been makin' wooden crosses.
With names and dates on 'em like it was some kinda grave.
All right, let's go. Search all the houses, the stores, and the stables.
Anywhere you think he could be hiding.
All right, let's go.
Hey, you, stranger,
- can you manage a pistol, huh?
- Yeah.
How would you like to make a thousand?
No.
Why not?
If you don't mind,
I'd like to finish the game.
Hmm. Come on, you two.
Finish the game?
No, these ain't chips.
They're just plain shavings.
He didn't make the cross here.
That's for certain.
That's very lucky for you, Mister.
Pack your stuff and get out of here.
Why?
This is my home.
Get going-
You got one hour to get out of town.
No!
No! Not those. Not those.
- You're gonna get out of town?
- I'll get out.
I'll get out.
Yes. Now.
You ain't goin' to a party.
You don't need all that stuff.
We just want you out of the way for a couple of days.
Get movin'.
Come on.
Get goin'.
You ain't thinkin' of arguing, are ya?
Clay, don't.
It's only for a few days.
- Go on.
- Get in.
- Let's go.
- Come on, move along now.
- Let's go...
- Move it.
- Come on...
- Hit that horse.
Hit him!
- Hey, easy!
- There you go.
Get along!
Why are you making everyone leave town?
What's the point?
It'll be easier to run him down.
Do you think you'd recognize him?
If he's the one who was at your ranch, of course I would.
But you're making a mistake, you know, if you expect him to fall into a clumsy trap.
I think he'll manage to disappoint you.
We'll see.
At present,
I have 20 men with me.
And there are more riding in later.
I'm afraid he hasn't a chance.
We've come too far from town.
We won't find anyone here.
Let's go back.
Hey, there's a house.
Maybe we're in for real trouble.
That's what I think.
I'm not afraid.
You know, you shouldn't think so hard.
Only thing I ever think about is getting enough of this here stuff.
Damn him.
The men are covering the whole town.
If he's here, he won't get away.
Hmm.
You can be sure of that, Mr. Murdok.
Sure of it?
But so far he's done whatever he wanted to.
Those men you hired to protect me can't even look after themselves.
Make sure you keep your eyes open, Brett.
What if he has an accomplice?
Brett?
There'll be a reward for the man who catches him.
But why is he chasing you?
Hmm?
The great Murdok, runnin' away from a mysterious shadow.
Maybe you ought to leave here.
A contract is a contract.
Besides, I don't wanna miss the best part of this here show.
Alida, where does this one go?
Let me see.
You'll find out... that with a bit of patience... all the pieces fall into place.
And that's the end of the game.
What is it?
I think I hear something.
You're starting to make me nervous.
Mm. Mm.
Hey, you know what happened to the fellas with the Mexican.
He appeared like that.
Out of nowhere.
Hey, Evans.
Whereabouts you dig up that bottle of whiskey, anyway?
I ain't seen any for months.
Back at the farmhouse.
You ain't gonna drink it by yourself.
I ain't gonna drink a drop of it, and if you want any, ask them Yankees.
They'll give us plenty if we let 'em through.
That'll be the day.
Hey, Django, you'll ruin your eyes reading like that.
Hey, look what my patrol found.
Hey. Must be almost six months since I've tasted whiskey.
How about me and you knockin' back some of this?
I'd sure like to, Django, only some of the boys think... that we should give it to the officers.
- The officers?
- Yeah.
Nobody can accuse us of not being generous. Come on.
Captain Howard, sir? Major Murdok?
That's funny. Where are they?
And what's happened to the lieutenant?
Looks like they've all gone.
Deserted.
Left us.
I don't understand.
Why would they do that?
Hey, what do you think?
Now, who's on watch?
Collins.
Collins!
He was on duty, I think.
But where the Devil is he?
Hey, Collins.
That's Major Murdok's knife.
- Then they're traitors.
- But why? Why?
We'd better warn the other men.
Evans.
Evans!
Answer me, Evans!
We're under attack!
It's an ambush!
We're under attack!
Yankees are attackin'. Hurry!
Let's suppose someone lives.
Don't worry, Lieutenant Hawkins.
There won't be any survivors.
I'm over here.
Everyone else thinks you're some kind of ghost or phantom.
But I know you're a real man.
What if you find out that the others are right?
I'll take a chance.
Who's in the house?
There's only Luke.
Apart from him, we're alone.
All the men are out searching the town.
Aren't you a little scared?
No, not scared of you.
I'll show you where the money is if... you help me get away.
I told you I ain't interested in money.
Thanks.
You can't buy anything with hate.
Major Murdok.
Over 13 years it's taken me to find you...
Major Murdok.
To deliver this to you, this whiskey.
Do you recall a soldier called Evans?
A brave soldier.
They were all brave soldiers in our regiment.
Yep, all brave boys.
They believed in obeyin' their officers.
In puttin' down all they had into... fightin' for their country, and they died happy, because they never knew the truth.
That they'd been deserted, sold out, that their own officers betrayed them.
That they stood by and watched the killing.
They never found out the truth.
They died thinking it was for honor and loyalty.
They didn't know that you and your friends had sold 'em to the enemy like a herd of cattle.
Well, now you're gonna pay, Murdok.
You're gonna die slowly.
You're gonna die a thousand deaths like your men.
And I'm gonna watch you die.
Slowly.
Slowly.
Slowly.
Slowly.
No! No!
No!
Have a good look through the livery stables there, and don't let him get you by surprise.
He's gonna keep us runnin' around here the who darn night.
You really believe there's anything in this story?
I sure do.
And I don't like it.
If it weren't for all he promised...
I'd sure like to get a good look at this fella.
I'm tired of just sitting 'round.
My brother's always been good to me, and I wanna help him now.
Then just try to keep out of the way.
You think I'm really too darn stupid to do anything, don't you?
But I'm not. I ain't crazy.
I can help just like the others.
I've been thinking about all this, and I've got a plan I think will work.
Oh, that's very interesting.
And what is your plan?
I was wondering about what he's really like and if we couldn't offer him money to clear out.
You don't understand, Luke.
It's no use tryin'.
Of course it is.
That isn't his game.
Then we'll make it his game.
It just depends on the size of the stakes.
You draw his fire. Go on.
I'll be damned. It's just a trick.
There ain't no man livin' could ever refuse all that money.
I'm gonna take this over to the church.
And leave it there.
You tell Django about it.
Make him go, Alida.
Tell him he has to leave here.
Alone.
Don't be stupid, Luke.
He doesn't want me.
Take it easy next time, will ya?
That was one of ours.
Greed is a sin. A deadly sin.
- Evenin', Mrs. Murdok.
- Evenin', ma'am.
Wouldn't mind knowing what's the cause of all these goings on.
I don't believe it's just one man.
It don't figure.
Who's that?
Stop!
But...
It's a dummy.
- Why'd he do that?
- Can't you guess?
If this keeps on, I'm gonna clear out of this here town.
We're safe enough if we all stick together.
Don't you think so, stranger?
Well, that's your opinion.
What happened?
What was that?
By God, he won't get away with this.
Help me...
Give me a hand over here.
Hey, Jack, over here.
Help me turn this guy over.
He tricked them like a bunch of kids.
What do we do now, Brett?
Take the rest of the men and turn this town inside out.
Hey, help me up.
Get him up.
But find him, Frank, and I want him kept alive. You understand?
Okay.
I found you. Thank goodness.
You can't go on with this.
They're bound to get you sooner or later.
Listen, Luke wants to pay you to let us alone.
Take the money and go.
Please do it.
But I thought that's what you wanted.
Not now.
It wouldn't mean anything to me alone.
You should know better than to trust a woman.
You devil, Luke.
I'll give my brother your gun.
He'll be very glad to get it.
He's afraid of you.
Everyone will be jealous of me, won't they?
Clever, Luke.
A smart fella.
I'll bet that everyone else thinks they're better than you are.
But it's not true.
You're smarter than all of those guys your brother has hired.
Smarter than all of them put together.
They think they're clever, but... you're the one I'm really afraid of.
And I'm right to be afraid of you, Luke.
You fooled me so easily.
That's enough.
Shut up!
And don't look at me.
I don't like your face.
Run, Alida!
That man's not supernatural.
He's flesh and blood.
This is his gun.
Look. This is his blood.
His blood.
His blood!
Do you understand?
Quick! Hurry.
Hey, everybody. Quick!
Come here! Hurry.
I hit him!
I hit him.
He's injured! He isn't a ghost!
Look! Here's his blood!
I hit him, I tell you.
I hit him. Look, his blood.
Here it is on my hand.
Look, everyone, he's injured.
Look, this is his blood.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Start searching.
Find him. Now that I've injured him.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
He's no ghost! Let's go! Come on!
Rod! Come on!
Rod! Come on!
This is his blood, Rod.
Rod, and I took his pistol away.
And I disarmed him all by myself, Rod.
Wasn't that clever of me, Rod?
Wasn't it? Huh?
He must be near here.
Get some torches and search the whole village.
But be quick.
Get moving!
Hey, Nick?
Don't forget to look under the wagon.
All right.
And if I find a ghost,
I'll give him to you.
- You see anything?
- No.
Come on.
Hey, Dick, you think this fella really exists?
I don't know what to think now.
I think they're all crazy.
Anyhow, it's Murdok's problem.
I just don't wanna get killed like those other guys.
You and me neither, friend.
It ain't worth it.
What say we talk to the others?
Why not? Let's try.
If they feel the same, we can all clear out.
Sure.
Anyhow, there ain't no one in here.
- The men are starting to get frightened.
- Tell the boss?
I don't know how to keep 'em under control anymore.
Hey, Brett, we are leaving.
You all accepted the money that I offered ya.
That was the bargain.
You ain't leavin' now.
Is that clear?
This trash is all yours.
You'll be sorry you did that.
Now it doesn't matter.
If all you men wanna leave here, you're free to do so.
Muchas gracias, Señor Murdok.
You're not going anywhere.
Gunfighters.
Why, you're more like sheep, you are.
Get down off them horses.
I promise, you try to leave, and it'll be your last move on Earth.
Yeah...
Aah! Let's get out of here!
Probably that was just what he wanted us to do.
We'd better wait for the dawn now.
You and the men tidy up this mess,
Brett.
Come on, boys.
Let's get to work.
The men are all stationed around the house, Mr. Murdok.
He must be somewhere.
Don't worry.
We'll find him in the morning.
It'll soon be dawn.
I have to go to the church.
Sorry, Mr. Luke.
You can't go outside.
Your brother's orders.
Oh, well. I suppose it can wait.
Yes, Mr. Luke.
Try and speak now if you can.
This time you've lost the game.
It's all over for you.
You can't get away now.
I've been looking forward for a long time to this moment.
No one can save you now.
Nobody!
Wait.
Must... be patient!
It takes time to die!
No...
You can't do that!
Sorry, boss.
Your kid brother hit me over the head and went out to the church.
He was lookin' for Django.
Come on, men.
Hey, Luke!
Luke!
Luke.
Luke.
You want me?
Aah!
Today's your day, Murdok.
It is my day.
I have to correct a mistake that was made 13 years ago.
Somehow, you survived.
Do it if you can, Murdok.
Django.
Django.
Where are you, Django?
No, please wait.
Hey, look what I got.
Let me go along with ya.
We'll be rich forever.
We won't live forever.
But...
Hey!
Don't leave me alone, Django.
You can't.
Just a minute.
Django!
Django!
♪ Django ♪
You? You again! Get out!
Do what I told you.
Get out!
Go on! Run! I'll teach you to keep away from me!
Run!
Papa!
You filthy dog!
You'll settle with me!
Let's go.
Welcome to you, stranger.
My name is Juan de Dios.
I am the bell ringer.
Why are you here?
To see the Rojos?
No, not the Rojos.
Is it the Baxters, maybe?
No, maybe not even the Baxters.
You want to get rich? Well, for that you have come to the right place, if you use your head.
That's because everybody here has become very rich, or else they are dead.
What you want to buy?
Some guns? Liquor?
You don't buy. You sell.
You sell lead in exchange for gold.
You will get rich here, or you'll be killed.
Juan de Dios tolls the bell once again.
Saludos, amigo!
It's not smart to go wandering so far from home.
I reckon he picked the wrong trail.
Or he could have picked the wrong town.
His big mistake, I think, was getting born.
If you want any work, looking like that you could try being a scarecrow.
Oh, no, the crows are liable to scare him, maybe.
Hello.
You can't get rich like that.
At most, you will only succeed in being killed.
With all of the trouble we have, all we needed was you.
What are you looking for?
Food and something to drink.
Water's over there.
No, no water.
Eating and drinking and killing.
That's all you can do, just like the rest of your kind.
By the way, you'll have to mark this up.
I know. You have no money.
After all, you just got into town.
But if you don't mind doing a little killing, you will have no trouble finding someone eager to pay you.
Hmm.
My roulette wheel.
That, too, was bartered.
No one ever comes here to play.
We spend our time here between funerals and burials.
Never saw a town as dead as this one.
You will never see another like it.
What's wrong with the place?
We've had too many killings.
You have seen the women?
None of them are women.
They're widows.
The place has only widows.
Here you can only gain respect by killing other men.
So nobody works anymore.
Seems somebody doesn't share your opinion.
Yes.
Know why Piripero looked you over?
To take your measurements.
He is so experienced he can do it with a glance.
You will be a customer.
Don't laugh. I'm not joking.
I want to warn you that those murderers will make a corpse out of you one day.
That's why I want you to get out of here.
You don't want to stay in this cemetery.
Finish up and get out.
I told you
I can't pay you.
Be my guest, but get out of San Miguel, will you?
Where does that lead?
The balcony.
Why are you going there? Hey.
To have a look.
Things always look different from higher up.
But nothing's up there.
Go ahead and get out!
Who are they?
Bandits.
Bandits and smugglers.
They come down from Texas.
They cross the frontier to stock up on guns and liquor.
The cost is much less here.
Then they go back and sell the guns and liquor to the Indians.
Any town that sells guns and liquor has gotta be a rich one.
Not the town, only those who buy and sell, and the bosses are the ones who clean up.
Yeah? Somebody has to run the place.
Every town has a boss.
That's true, but when there are two around, then I'd say that there is one too many.
Two bosses?
Very interesting.
Interesting is right.
The Rojos boys, three brothers who sell liquor.
And then there's the Baxters, big gun merchants.
If I'm not mistaken, you already met Baxter's gang, didn't you?
Yeah, we met.
But you're lucky. They don't usually limit their fire to the mule.
A man leaves his own land and looks around for any reason,
Juan de Dios tolls the bell and
Piripero sells another coffin.
Two bosses.
They've enlisted all the scum that hangs around both sides of the frontier, and they pay in dollars.
The Baxters over there.
The Rojos there.
Me right in the middle.
Where you do what?
Crazy bell ringer was right.
There's money to be made in a place like this.
If you're thinking what I suspect,
I tell you, don't try it.
Which one of the two is the stronger?
Which one of them is stronger?
Well, the Rojos, especially Ramon.
Don Miguel Rojo,
I want to talk to you.
Don Miguel, I hear you're hiring on men.
Well, I might just be available.
I gotta tell you before you hire me,
I don't work cheap.
Get three coffins ready.
Listen, stranger.
Didn't you get the idea?
We don't like to see bad boys like you in town.
Go get your mule.
You let him get away from you?
That's what I want to talk to you about.
He's feeling real bad.
My mule.
He got all riled up when you men fired those shots at his feet.
Hey, are you making some kind of joke?
Mmm-mmm. No.
See, I understand you men were just playing around.
But the mule...
He just doesn't get it.
Of course, if you were to all apologize...
I don't think it's nice, you laughing.
You see, my mule don't like people laughing.
He gets the crazy idea you're laughing at him.
Now, if you apologize, like I know you're going to,
I might convince him that you really didn't mean it.
I saw the whole thing.
You killed all four of them.
You'll pay all right.
You'll be strung up.
Who are you?
Don't fire a shot.
I'm John Baxter, sheriff.
Yeah? Well, if you're the sheriff, you better get these men underground.
My mistake. Four coffins.
I told you I wasn't cheap, but I think you'll find it's worth your while.
The rest when you're all done.
When do I start?
I'm not in a hurry, at least for the moment.
I'd say with four less Baxters, right now is as good a time to start as any.
In a few days I hear there will be a troop of cavalry passing through San Miguel.
I wouldn't want the military sticking their long noses into our business.
You seem to be well informed.
In these parts, a man's life often depends on a mere scrap of information.
This thing couldn't have been very useful to its owner.
My brother Ramon did that. He often uses it for target practice.
With a gun in his hand, no one stands in his way.
The suit of armor is one of his favorite targets, naturally, when he does not have anything better to shoot.
Well, I'll be kind of curious to meet this brother of yours.
Ah.
This is Chico, one of the most trusted of my men.
Follow him. He will bring you to your room.
I would like you to feel at home.
Well, I never found home that great, but let's go.
Who's that?
Her name's Marisol.
You just forget about her.
This one will be your room.
You gave him $100.
We never pay that much.
Can you explain to me why you have taken him on?
To have that filthy gringo around the house and to give him $100 besides?
We have never paid anybody so much.
You cannot leave someone like that to do what he wants around here.
He's capable of doing anything. And
I want law and order in this place.
If that is all you want, there is a much cheaper way.
Just snuff him out.
And who will be the one? You?
Yes, why not?
A shot in his back, then you would have him out of the way in no time at all.
Listen, I could do it easily right now.
He won't be expecting it, and I'd get back the $100.
You're stupid, Esteban!
Even if you are my brother!
A bullet in the back, eh?
And it is ended!
And what happens if your hand should tremble slightly?
And he's only been hurt?
And with the cavalry arriving in town and that Yankee so quick on the draw.
I was only thinking... You mustn't think of anything!
You let me do the thinking instead.
Go and see the americano. Just ask him if he needs anything and make friends.
Get one thing clear in that head of yours.
This is going to be a quiet town until Ramon gets back!
Is that clear? A quiet town.
I am Esteban Rojo.
My brother asked me to...
What are you doing?
Moving.
But didn't you know all our men live here with us?
That's all very cozy, but I don't find you men all that appealing.
Besides, your brother said he didn't have any need for me anymore right now.
Halt!
- Sergeant?
- Yes, Capitan?
Tell the men we'll be spending tonight here in this place.
Arrange it so they can pick up the supplies here.
Also, double the guard in order to watch the stagecoach there.
Yes, sir.
What do you suppose they're carrying in that coach?
It'd be easy to find out.
Get up close to it and take a little look at what's in it.
If they fire at you, you know it's gold.
Not a bad idea.
Looking for anything?
Hello.
Get out of here, Yankee.
Why aren't you sleeping?
When I see you staring like that, it bothers me.
I still keep wondering what was in that stagecoach.
It's something they seem to think is very important.
I asked a few questions of the captain and almost was arrested.
Who's Marisol?
You better get some sleep.
You need it.
It's much too dangerous, even for you.
All I did is ask who she was.
She is a woman.
And Ramon's madly in love with her.
Does that make it clear to you?
Everybody in this town talks about Ramon.
Kind of curious to meet him.
If you are smart, you will try to stay clear of Ramon as long as possible.
There are the soldiers.
They are moving on very quietly.
Strange.
They're headed for the frontier.
Tell me, is that the way you go to bed every night?
Don't worry.
I didn't dirty the sheets.
No, wait. I'm coming, too.
I want to see for myself how you're going to get yourself in trouble.
All right. All right.
Go ahead.
It's like playing cowboys and Indians.
- Captain.
- Welcome, Lieutenant.
There is your gold as promised.
I hope the guns you will be giving us will be equally useful to our army.
Rest assured, Captain. We'll check them over together.
Get their clothes on again, and hurry.
Be sure to place them around right.
Remember. They died fighting among themselves.
Rubio!
There. It's Ramon.
This is my brother Ramon.
I think I mentioned him.
Everybody talks about Ramon.
And many speak of you, too, my dear brother included.
Well, I hope they say nice things.
Did you have a good trip?
It was tiring.
It was terribly hot on the road during the day.
And stagecoaches are an uncomfortable way to travel.
Well, I'm sure you'll be in great shape in no time.
The americano cannot wait to get into action.
I am sorry. He's going to be a disappointed man.
How's that?
The Baxters accepted the invitation.
They'll come tonight,
Don Miguel.
The Baxters coming here?
You must be out of your head.
Chico followed my orders. I told him to invite them here.
Ramon, what is this?
I have found out many things when I was traveling, and I have decided that it's very stupid, to just keep on shooting at each other and without any results.
You've gone out of your mind, Ramon.
No, I have come to my senses, Esteban.
Believe me.
Trust me.
Life can be so precious.
It's foolish to risk losing it every minute, no?
There's plenty of space for everybody in this town.
Even Baxters.
For this reason,
I've decided to hang my gun up on the wall.
I think that
Ramon has the right idea.
I, too, am getting tired of these killings.
They must stop.
This is all very, very touching.
You mean you don't admire peace?
It's not real easy to like something you know nothing about.
Stay in San Miguel and you may just profit from the experience.
No, thanks. I'll be moving on.
Here's your money,
Don Miguel.
I only used a small amount of it.
I don't like to take money unless I feel I've earned it.
Now, why are you so hasty?
You should stay here.
You might enjoy dining with us tonight.
You see, the Baxters have four men in the cemetery on account of me.
I don't think they'd appreciate my presence.
I don't like that americano.
He's too smart to be just a hired fighter.
At shooting a pistol no one can touch him.
I can see that.
When someone with that face works with his gun, you may count on two things.
He's fast on the trigger, but he's also intelligent.
That makes him too dangerous for you, I think, my brothers.
And now that he's gone, will you please explain that silly nonsense about hanging up your gun and making up with the Baxters?
Is it possible, old fellow, that you'll never be able to reach any conclusions on your own?
Don't you think our government and the
americanos will find those bodies, and then start an investigation?
They'll investigate, all right, and we'll be quiet and peacefully abide our time.
We know nothing about the massacre at the Rio Bravo, eh?
I arranged for the bodies to be lying, as if both companies killed each other.
But do you think they'll believe it?
Yes, I think so.
Because if they don't find some guilty party, it would be a pretty good reason to call off the investigation.
Yes, but what about the Baxters?
The Baxters?
They want nothing more than to live in peace.
We'll let them have their own way for a while.
So forget about the Baxters.
We'll take care of them later when the investigation finishes.
That was a fine idea that you had.
What was it again?
Ah, yes, yes, yes.
The Baxters on one side.
The Rojos on the other.
And you'd be in the middle.
The only problem is that they've joined up.
Now you are without a job, and you don't have money to pay me what you owe me.
There is only one thing for you to do.
Leave here immediately.
I will forget about what you owe me.
And you leave San Miguel and never come back for the rest of your days.
Joe, I have prepared the wagon the way you asked me to.
It's sitting out in the back here with two empty coffins.
What are you up to?
Are you changing your profession?
If you want to go on living, you'd better.
In my opinion, you'll make a fine pallbearer.
Close this place and come with me, huh?
Oh, close up?
It's done. Where are we going?
I'd like to know where we are going, or is it a secret?
Down by the river. Have a look at some corpses down there.
The Rojos say, "Come to dinner," and we must go.
But I don't like it at all, even if they've granted all the guarantees we've demanded.
We'll go along with it, but don't touch anything.
You mustn't eat.
You mustn't drink.
You just keep your eyes open and keep your wits about you.
Are you sure that nobody has seen us?
Only a ghost or two.
Oh, no, no, no. Don't joke about things like this.
Ghosts are better left where they are.
You look as though this place suits you very well.
If you go on like this, you will soon be here permanently.
I do not understand.
Why is it with all those bodies down by the river we are just burying these two?
We're not.
We're not gonna bury them.
What do you mean we're not burying them?
That's right.
We're not gonna bury them.
If we are not going to bury them,
I would like to know what we will use them for?
Why are we taking the trouble to do this?
The dead can be very useful sometimes.
They've helped me out of tough spots more than once.
First, they don't talk.
Second, they can be made to look alive if I manage it right.
And, third...
Well, third, if you shoot them, there's no worry,
'cause they're dead already.
Understand?
It doesn't make a bit of sense to me, and I'm getting out.
I'm alive, and I want to remain with the living, understand?
And when I'm dead, I'll want to remain with the dead.
I would be unhappy if somebody living forces me to remain with the living.
I hope that's clear.
And, also, I don't like the idea that you've placed those bodies there!
The man buried there is the only one who died of pneumonia in this cursed town!
Take it easy now, will you?
These two friends of ours here are gonna help me pay your bill.
Get up there!
The only reason they could have to start a war with us, would be to kidnap you from your husband's side.
He's gallant, this Rojo.
I really didn't think him capable of compliments.
And he's not. All that he says is false, like his proposals.
You women. If things aren't complicated for you, you become suspicious.
Yes, because to me, it just didn't seem right.
It went too smoothly.
I don't trust them.
You'd like to prove me wrong, wouldn't you?
Always the same thing.
Good night.
Good night.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just want you to know why the Rojos want to make peace all of a sudden.
You see, there was once a wagon load of gold that the soldiers were taking to the border.
John, come up here quickly.
Sorry, but when a husband finds a man in his wife's bedroom, you're never sure how he's gonna react.
Give him $500.
How's that?
Give the money to him.
He has an interesting story.
Listen to him.
That's the right idea?
You didn't misunderstand?
I get the wrong idea only when it suits me.
- Ramon.
- What is it?
The soldiers, the ones who were escorting the gold...
Two of those soldiers got away. They are hiding out in the cemetery.
The Baxters.
They're about to capture them.
Rubio! Get the men!
You are well-informed, eh?
A man's life in these parts often depends on a mere scrap of information.
Your brother's own words.
Tell me. Why are you doing this for us?
With these two soldiers as witnesses against Ramon, the government will be able to rid the town of the Rojos and their whole band.
Then San Miguel will have just one boss.
Hurry!
Let's go!
Coming with us?
Oh, no. When a man's got money in his pocket, he begins to appreciate peace.
Come on!
Let's leave the horses here.
Who's there? Come out!
What do you think?
I don't know.
There's something about it
I don't like.
Too still to be wounded.
More like dummies.
Sure, dummies that are very interesting to the Rojos.
Better hide. Hurry.
What'll we do?
Take two men and circle around to the side.
Try to keep them busy long enough for me to get those two down there.
Go on. Go on. Quickly.
Keep me covered. I am going to take care of those two.
Listen, Baxter! You can have them now if you like!
Since dead men can't talk!
It seems they didn't like my joke.
We'll let them go home in a little while.
Keep this bad boy as our guest, only until Baxter leaves San
Miguel and heads for the frontier.
Put him in the cellar.
Esteban, good work.
With Antonio as our prisoner, the
Baxters have to give in to us.
Now we can make any kind of demand.
Don Miguel! Don Miguel!
What has happened?
Talk, will you?
I don't know, but somebody shot at me.
Marisol!
Marisol!
Where are you, Marisol?
It's strange how you always manage to be in the right place at the right time.
It's nothing serious. A headache that will pass. She'll sleep.
Keep your eyes open. She's not to move from that room. You hear?
I wouldn't mention anything about me bringing her here.
I wouldn't want the Rojos to think I was on your side.
Don't be worried.
I'm a woman who's rich enough to appreciate the men my money can buy.
I've been to talk to the Rojos.
They'll give back Antonio in exchange for Marisol.
It'll take place in the morning.
Very soon you are going to be rich.
Yeah, and that's not gonna break my heart.
Where is she? You said
I'd be able to see her!
Where is she?
I wanna see her!
Come back here, Jesus.
Come here. Where is she?
I want to see her!
I want to see her!
Why can't I look at her?
I want to see her!
Go. Go to him, Marisol.
Mama!
Mama!
Jesus!
Mama!
Jesus!
Mama! Mama!
Julio!
Marisol.
Get Julio.
You were warned to get out of town.
Now I'm gonna make you pay once and for all.
Let him be.
You better get going.
Ramon's waiting.
And, you, get that kid home where he belongs.
A pig, that Ramon.
What's Ramon got to do with them?
You weren't told, eh?
In this part of the world, the story is very old.
A happy little family until trouble comes along.
And trouble has the name of Ramon.
Claiming the husband cheated at cards, which wasn't true, he gets the wife to live with him as hostage.
And the husband?
Him? There's nothing for him to do.
The Rojos threatened to kill his little boy Jesus, and he was forced to accept things.
That Ramon is smart.
Where are you going?
To the Rojos to look for a job.
I am glad we have the
americano with us.
It's the best thing that could have happened to us, you know,
'cause if either government starts an inquiry, we'll need every man we can get.
I guess you know to be at war with the Baxters now, is worse than sitting on a big case of dynamite.
Where should we put this?
Put it over there.
Come on, everybody!
Drink up!
Good shooting.
Very good shooting.
When you want to kill a man, you must shoot for his heart.
And the Winchester is the best weapon.
That's very nice, but I'll stick with my .45.
When a man with a .45 meets a man with a rifle, the man with the pistol will be a dead man.
That's an old Mexican proverb, and it's true.
You believe that?
Paquito, take five men and escort
Marisol to the small house.
And stay there till I return.
Everything's prepared.
Do not be worried.
I will return tomorrow.
All the wagons are ready.
We can leave.
Everyone, enjoy yourselves during my absence.
You heard Ramon.
Let's have a good time.
~ Do you remember
sweet Becky from Pike ~
~ She roamed the world
with her lover Ike ~
~ Ike and Betsy ~
~ Betsy from Pike ~
He weighs over a ton.
Of course, with all he poured into himself.
Papa, did you not tell me no one could go see Mama?
That's right.
Then why does that man see her when I cannot?
- I want Mama.
- Go away from the door.
Quiet! Quiet.
We cannot show ourselves.
You must remember that.
You must stay away.
Hello.
There's somebody shooting up at the small house.
Saddle the horses immediately!
Come on. Let's go!
Look out!
Here you are.
Now, take this money.
It's enough to live on for a while.
Now, get across the border.
Get as much distance between yourselves and San Miguel as possible.
How may we thank you for what you are doing?
Don't try. Just get going before the Rojos get here.
Why do you do this for us?
Why? 'Cause I knew someone like you once.
There was no one there to help. Now, get moving.
Get moving.
Get out of here!
What do you see, Chico?
They're all dead.
They massacred them.
They kidnapped Marisol!
This looks like the work of the Baxters.
Quick, let's get back before they attack our house and the town.
Chico, give out the ammunition.
Esteban, spread your men around the house.
Keep your eyes open.
Miguel, Paco, Vincente,
Martin, behind the house.
Manolo and Alvaro, come with me. Stay alert.
The way they killed the men in the small house, there must be a lot of them.
It's a warm evening.
One of our wagons lost a wheel, so we had to turn back here to get help.
One of the men tells me, the Baxters attacked the small house.
Do you know about it?
Tell me what you know.
Well?
Where did you hide Marisol?
Rubio.
You are thirsty.
You want to drink?
No, no, it is too soon to drink.
Bring him over here!
You are behaving like a stubborn idiot.
Tell us where Marisol is, and it will all be ended!
In a week, you'll be back in shape.
You'll get out and you can go wherever you want.
That's enough for today.
Sooner or later, he'll talk.
It's just a matter of time.
Watch out he doesn't escape or die.
Otherwise, do as you like.
But wait till he comes to.
This way, he hardly feels anything.
I've had a poker hand waiting for me for three days.
Now I'm stuck here! I can't get to it while I'm guarding this americano idiot!
I think you will find this more amusing than cards.
All orders are to be sure he does not die, and also make sure he regrets the day he was born.
The gringo is asleep,
I imagine.
That's all right.
I'll enjoy waking him up.
- Esteban, what was that noise?
- I do not know.
I heard a yell, and then a crash.
It's useless to hide.
You're finished playing the smart boy.
Go up and look in the loft.
And take a look behind the barrels!
Let's get out of here!
Hurry! Quick!
Hurry with that water!
Hey, you, come with me!
Surround the town! Block all the streets leading out!
Find him for me!
Esteban, search the whole town.
Follow me!
Get him back right now!
You've got to at any cost!
Look in the stables, in every corral, in the storeroom!
Look for him in the church!
Go in there!
Search every inch of it!
Search everywhere!
Rubio, in here!
If somebody is hiding him, burn their house down, and kill them like dogs!
You, up here!
Look for him near the Baxters, but take him alive! I want him alive!
Alive!
Rubio, in the bar.
He says he knows nothing.
He's trying to be smart.
Bring him here to me.
I swear,
I'm telling the truth.
Well, you know nothing, huh?
- Nothing. I've not seen him.
- Rubio, you take care of him.
Where have you hidden him?
I didn't...
You're the right friend for that filthy americano.
And you'll end up the same way.
We looked everywhere.
In his cellar, in the attic, on the roof.
But there is no trace.
I couldn't find anybody there in the back room.
I'm certain he has taken refuge with the Baxters.
The americano isn't stupid.
He knows that that's the best place for him to hide.
The Baxters, eh?
Then better go and get him.
And that's for being his friend.
Curse them.
Piripero.
Eh?
Piripero.
- Come here.
- I can't see anybody.
Come here.
Dios mio!
What are you doing in there?
Never mind.
Get me out of here.
But you're not dead yet.
I will be if you don't get me out of here, quick.
Get that lid down.
Rubio.
I see some signs of life.
Let's be ready when they decide to come out.
Don't shoot!
We surrender!
Don't shoot!
Stop! Don't shoot!
We're coming out!
- I'm surrendering! Hold back your fire!
- Don't shoot!
We're surrendering!
Stop.
I wanna take a look at this.
Ramon, don't shoot!
We're coming out!
We surrender!
Listen, you've won.
It's enough!
I'll get out of town!
I'll do whatever you like!
- You promise that?
- I swear it, Ramon!
You won't try a trick of any kind?
None! No, no tricks!
I said before, I give you my word.
We'll leave!
Are you sure? You had better ask permission of your wife.
Maybe she won't be too happy!
Antonio!
John!
Murderers.
They had no guns.
Murderers!
I hope you rot in hell!
May you and your brothers die spitting blood!
Curse you for this!
Murderers!
Let's go.
The show's over, anyway.
Keep looking for him.
Search among those bodies.
The filthy americano has to be somewhere!
Silvanito?
Where's Silvanito?
Any news today?
I have to tell you some news that's pretty bad.
I hate to tell you this, Joe, but...
Where is Silvanito?
Silvanito, he was captured this morning by those men of Ramon's.
They grabbed him outside the village.
He was on his way to this mine.
He was bringing in some provisions.
Ramon's got him now.
He's being tortured, but he won't talk.
I know him well.
He's a stubborn man.
No matter what they do, he won't say a word, even if it means his life.
Listen to me. They'll never be able to force him.
Now, old fool, loosen up your tongue.
No.
Rubio!
You better get back to your shop, old man.
- You're liable to have some business.
- Very good!
That's what
I wanted to hear.
And I have a little surprise for you that I brought along.
I know how much you are going to need it.
It was very hard to get my hands on it.
But I got it by first using my head.
No one can resist two barrels of wine.
Isn't that right?
Then I thought that, well, you might need that pistol, and I brought another present.
It's dynamite.
I stole it from the Rojos.
And now it seems to me the moment's come for you to light the fuse and send it back to them.
Still lots of light.
Too early to be asleep, yet.
Rubio, here.
I shouldn't like to ruin the rifle.
I could never find another like this.
Listen, Ramon, let's try it with this one now.
Gringo!
Heard you wanted to see me.
The americano's dead.
Let the old man down.
What's wrong, Ramon?
You losing your touch?
Are you afraid, Ramon?
You shoot to kill, you better hit the heart.
Your own words, Ramon.
The heart, Ramon.
Don't forget the heart.
Aim for the heart or you'll never stop me.
When a man with a .45 meets a man with a rifle, you said the man with the pistol's a dead man.
Let's see if that's true.
Go ahead, load up and shoot.
Hey, listen, Joe.
Listen, Joe, I... I...
Oh, Joe, Joe.
Well, guess your government will be glad to see that gold back.
And you, you don't want to be here when they get it, eh?
You mean, the Mexican government on one side, and maybe the Americans on the other side?
Me, right smack in the middle?
Too dangerous.
- So long.
- Adiós.
DAY OF ANGER
Morning, Mr Corbitt.
Have you got anything for me today?
No, Scott. And push off with that barrel.
My nose can't stand that awful stink.
Why, it's all from the respectable citizens of Clifton.
Beat it.
Hey. You see that, Scott?
Even though I'm considered blind, bet there's no-one with an aim like that in all of Clifton. In fact, in all Arizona.
You bet, Bill.
You're the best shot in all of the West.
You filthy tramp.
How many times do I have to tell you... not to dirty my bottles?
I have to use them again.
And you know it.
Now, get out of here...or
I'll get rid of that other eye for you.
Bill didn't dirty 'em on purpose,
Mr Murray.
I'll wash the bottles.
Don't ever touch me again, you...
You ugly son of a bitch!
- I wonder what's up.
- Uh-huh.
Why, it's years since we've heard any shooting like that in Clifton.
Who fired that shot?
A bonehead or a boozer?
It's nothing serious.
Mr Murray sizzled buckshot in our old friend Bill's behind.
Where are you going?
There's the barrel to empty.
Don't pass this way.
You'll stink up the saloon.
Back the other way.
Mr Murray, I thought
I heard some shooting.
It was me, Nigel. To clean out the barrel.
You should do the same, every so often, if you can still find your gun.
Well, I'm the law here.
This, in Clifton, is worth more than fancy hardware.
Whoa. Morning, Doctor.
Where have you been so bright and early?
I had a rough night of it, between a birth and a bad case of diarrhoea.
No complications, I hope.
About the birth, I think you should ask Hart Perkins.
His wife had two little boys.
As for the case of diarrhoea, it was that old mare of Judge Cutcher's.
Scott... when you're finished your rounds, take your broom and go and sweep in front of Skill's house, you hear'?
Yes, Mr Miller.
- Hiya, Gwen.
- How are you?
I haven't seen you for a long time.
Show too much and you can't sell it.
And you...
Have you come here to gawk?
Now get busy with that broom.
When you're finished, come to me.
I'll give you a quarter.
Thanks a lot, Vivian.
I don't want anything for doing it.
I don't forget how much you did for me, when I was here.
You were just a babe in arms, Scott.
Are you looking for something?
A stable.
Ah, yes. There's Miller's stable at the far end of the street.
You can't miss it.
And where can I sleep...and sleep good?
There at the saloon.
You passed by it just now.
Gambling house and hotel, bar and a restaurant.
You'll like it.
You want to earn a dollar?
Take my horse to the stable.
Yes, sir.
What's your name?
- Scott.
- Scott what?
Only Scott.
Because of my mother.
I never did know her.
And what was her name?
Her first name was Mary.
Mary.
It's as good as any other name.
Why not call yourself "Scott Mary"?
They'd all laugh at me, if I said my name was "Scott Mary".
So what?
Who knows for sure whether they'd laugh at it?
When you get my horse settled, come on over to the saloon and pick up your dollar.
My name's Talby.
Another job, Murph.
Take good care of him.
I've already earned a dollar just for bringing him here.
Look at that saddle.
First-class leather. Worked by hand.
What are you going to do with that dollar?
Why, I'm saving it.
With this, I already have eight.
And when I save another ten,
I'll be buying a Colt at the emporium.
And what will you do with it, sonny?
The days of fast guns are over.
Once upon a time, a good pistol was worth more than money in the bank.
When Doc Holliday of the OK Corral died, there was a real massacre of people trying to get hold of his gun.
Doc Holliday was the best shot in all the West.
Him, not his pistol.
Him AND his pistol.
There can be the experience of a lifetime in a gun.
It's not enough to be able to draw faster than the other guy, if the other guy knows a trick that you don't know.
In my day, we had to either learn the tricks or we gave work to the gravediggers.
I'll buy myself a Colt and I'm going to wear it.
I want to see if anyone'll still have the courage to call me a bastard.
The one I got now is wood, but it's better than pushing an old broom.
Right, Murph?
Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't just damn stupid when I taught you how to draw.
Do the job well, because this Talby might give you a dollar...
Talby?
Yeah. The name of the stranger.
Talby?
I think I've heard that name before.
You have, eh?
Not in this town, though.
Not in Clifton.
They're very pretty. Too bad. In a few days, they're gonna be dead.
My pa doesn't want you to speak to me.
Ever again.
Have another one.
Thanks, fellas. Now all
I gotta do is worry about feeding 'em.
Didn't think you had it in you...
Now, here's to the next litter.
There's your dollar.
Sit down.
It's all right.
Sit down.
Would you like a whiskey, Scott Mary?
Yeah...
What are you doing here?
He's my guest.
He wants a whiskey.
You're not from around here.
He cleans the toilets.
And collects the garbage.
Why, he sweeps the sidewalk.
Sometimes even the saloon.
He can't sit down here.
So, if he wants to drink, he's got to go to the kitchen.
- He ain't the kind of customer...
-  A whiskey.
All right.
Chuck him out, Abel.
Or should I do it?
You don't want to make us drink with that garbage man, do you?
Didn't you hear that?
Get outta here!
Scott Mary is my guest.
My guests drink with me as long as I or they please.
Listen, stranger.
Clifton is our city.
We don't want anyone to boss us around.
If you don't watch out, I'm gonna punch your teeth out and throw you outta here.
- Get out!
- You'll have to use your gun.
- Right now.
-  No!
You'll testify that I fired only after he aimed his gun at me.
Having heard the witnesses,
I, Judge Cutcher, in the name of the law proclaim that Hart Perkins died in the course of an unprovoked attack, during which, Mr Frank Talby exercised his right of self-defence.
We'll teach you to keep in your place.
Just one more question.
First man you ever killed, Talby?
That is, I mean, in self-defence, uh?
No, it wasn't my first one, Nigel.
You want me to put notches on my gun?
The hearing is closed.
Just a minute, you...
Wait...and hit him outside.
What the law doesn't see, it can't punish.
This'll teach you to keep in your place.
And don't dirty my saloon with your filthy presence.
You'll be needing lessons, Scott.
For your own good.
And this is for poor Perkins.
Those twins were born just yesterday.
Hold it, Murray.
The boy had nothing to do with it.
Go back to the stable, you old fool.
Come on, Sartana. Let's go.
Damn it all, Sartana.
It's because of you we lost him again.
- Come on, you stupid mule.
-  Hold it...
I don't like people to mistreat their animals.
But...
You been following me, kid.
You better come up with a good excuse or it may be your last one.
I had to escape.
They were out for my blood.
Now that's no excuse.
I want to get to be like you.
I know how to draw, but I've never had a real pistol.
If I'm taught right,
I'm pretty bright.
I'd be useful to you as a sort of partner.
Maybe.
All right.
First lesson...
Never beg another man.
You'll take me with you?
How much money you've got?
Eight dollars.
Give it to me.
It'll be useful for your second lesson.
Second lesson...
Never trust anyone.
Come on, Sartana.
We gotta go and hear that third lesson.
What's that?
Tequila, sefior.
You see, it's the only thing we got here.
It wets your throat.
Round here, everybody takes a glass before taking a trip.
Well, my trip ends here.
You go tell that to Wild Jack.
My name's Talby.
Right away, sefior.
Hey. Listen, stranger...
- What town is this?
- Bowie...
- Bowie. At least for now.
- For now? Why?
Because it's gonna be hell here, pretty soon.
Wild. Wild. Wild.
Third lesson...
Never get between a gun and its target.
Hello, Wild.
Come on in.
You're back, huh?
It would've been better if you hadn't come here, Talby.
Don't be a pessimist.
You never can tell.
I said that for your own good.
I'm not after revenge, Wild.
Give me my 50,000 dollars, we'll be friends again.
You can believe it or not...
I don't have one lousy, stinking dollar.
I just got outta jail three weeks ago.
I know that.
I've been waiting ten years to give you the bill.
You lost your money.
I spent ten years in jail.
That's your business.
In order to pull this deal, I had to bring in certain people from Clifton.
If you're gonna tell me your life story, why don't you sit down?
We were all set to pull a job in Abilene.
The Clifton people had clean hands.
They only passed on the information.
They said they were going to alibi for me.
Everything was perfect, there were no risks.
We were to split the money down the middle.
And those clean hands tricked you.
You're damn right they did.
They testified against me.
The money disappeared.
Well, what could I do?
My word against a banker?
A judge? The rest of those... honest, rich bastards?
And, so, my 50,000 ended up in their pockets too.
Exactly.
Well, why don't you go to Clifton now?
Take your revenge, if you have to.
But get the money that's owed to you and then you can pay your debt to me.
I got a price on my head.
They're looking for me all over Arizona.
I'm here in Bowie... but I got one foot in Mexico.
All right...
I'll tell you what we can do.
You get me the names of those people in Clifton and you go on down to Mexico... and you stay there.
What are you gonna do?
Let's say I'm buying you revenge for $50,000.
Then the honest people of Clifton can owe their debt to Frank Talby instead.
How's that?
Or else?
Or else...you have to pay.
One way or another.
All right, Talby.
I can't argue with you.
You're too fast.
Drinks for everyone.
I want to celebrate the return of an old friend.
Everybody drink.
You ain't drinking?
Not yet, Wild.
Maybe you're telling the truth... and maybe you're not.
If everything goes all right,
I'll drink to your health.
In Clifton.
You think you're pretty funny, don't you, Talby?
Well...we'll drink, amigos.
To Wild Jack's health.
Here...
No.
You ain't drinking either?
No. I'm with him.
We'll teach ya how to drink in Bowie.
That's enough, Wild.
Vengan.
Fourth lesson.
Punches are like bullets.
If you don't make the first ones count,
Scottie, you might just be finished.
I'll remember that.
Wild.
You're forgetting something, Wild. I still want the names of those people in Clifton.
I ain't forgetting nothing.
There was Turner, the banker.
He knew about the shipment of gold.
Judge Cutcher.
He was gonna alibi for me.
Abel Murray. He was driving the train.
Bill Farrell. He was in command of the garrison.
He's got a ranch now.
Out Stafford way.
No.
No, Frank.
Don't kill me.
No!
You can't kill him. You can't kill him.
Fifth lesson.
You wound a man, you better kill him.
Or sooner or later he's gonna kill you.
Bill Farrell?
Put your hands up.
If you make a move, you're a dead man.
Wild Jack responsible for this?
And you're gonna be next.
Your gun.
Come on.
Now you're going for a nice little ride.
One more time!
Well, turn around! Turn around!
Whose mule is that?
Sixth lesson.
The right bullet at the right time.
And well aimed.
Bravo, Scott Mary.
Bravo.
Looks like I owe you my life.
You owe me nothing.
But... take me along, will you?
Seventh lesson...
If you untie a man... take his gun before that.
Eighth lesson...
Don't give a man any more bullets than what he's got use for.
Very good.
All right, Scott.
You can come with me.
But don't get your hopes up too high 'cause it's a dirty life.
Mr Turner.
Well, welcome back, Mr Talby.
And what brings you here?
It's a matter of money.
You wish to make a deposit?
No. A withdrawal.
But... you've no account.
You've no account open here, Mr Talby.
I don't, but Wild Jack does.
But, er...
- Well, Wild Jack...
- Sh...
Wild Jack is dead.
But the account is still open and I've come to close it.
Er, what do you mean, sir?
Bill Farrell is dead too.
But before he died, he signed a confession in which he listed all the names of his accomplices, including yours.
Mr Talby...
What's the... the amount of the withdrawal?
A thousand dollars.
One thousand?
Gimme a thousand.
Here you are.
And...now may I have that... that document?
For so little? What do you take me for?
Thank you.
My money's safe with you.
Something wrong, Mr Turner?
Go call Abel Murray and Judge Cutcher. Immediately.
Yes, sir.
Wait. Just a moment.
For Abel Murray, it's much too late, I'm afraid.
Go and call the judge.
- Tell him to get here right away.
- Yes.
What does that mean?
We're partners.
Fifty-fifty, this whole place.
For a thousand dollars?
I know I'm generous.
I'm paying for something that's already mine.
But Mr Talby...
If this is a joke...
This is no joke.
I lost my sense of humour.
I inherited my half from Wild Jack.
I'm somebody in Clifton now.
I've got a bank account now... half a saloon...
...and these scales of justice will be leaning the way I tell them to and you just watch the way I tell them to.
Now sign.
What...
- What is this?
- It's a contract of partnership.
- But...
- Bill Farrell talked.
And you sign it or tomorrow you end up in the gallows.
Good.
Got a room for me?
- I'm boss now.
- Number seven.
What did you make me sign?
A nice, complete, detailed confession.
They're coming, Scott Mary.
All those people that are locked up in their houses.
The Perkins ranch is to the north so they should be coming from down there.
Scott, remember...
A man on horseback has to divide his attention between his horse and his gun.
So you cannot let them dismount.
Now, find yourself a spot in the shadows over there, where you can't be seen.
- You want me to shoot?
- Don't shoot until after I do.
And when you shoot, shoot fast.
And hit your target.
Uh-huh.
Your boys on the watch, huh?
Where have you put your little errand boy?
You'd better step aside a little. They're coming.
Give yourself up, Talby.
Listen, men.
I want you all to be law-abiding.
There's been a trial and Frank Talby was acquitted.
You're putting yourself right smack against the law.
So clear out of here or I'll put you in jail.
Since when you protecting killers with your shiny star?
You'd better listen to me, Mackenzie.
Remember what happened to Hart.
He met the wrong man and had a bad end.
Why listen to this fool'?
Let's get it over with.
We didn't come here to listen to his blabber.
Come on, let's make this Talby dance!
Better get out of here. He's spread his men around. He's set a trap.
Go to the devil, will you?
You stay back.
What are you waiting for?
What's going on here...
Good work, Scottie.
Now, nobody will dare get in your way.
- Not in this town.
- But...you're wounded.
No problem. It's just on the left side.
Four dead and two wounded.
I want to know what the devil you want, Talby.
I only shot after they knocked you down, Marshal.
Scott...
I think this town is ours.
Nothing more to be done for these two, Judge.
Absolutely unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.
- Aye...
You'll have to acquit him again, I'm afraid, Judge.
Where is he?
You've taken plenty of time.
My friend is wounded.
This one's much worse!
That's one of the men who attacked us.
Scott. You've been drinking.
Don't touch me, you bastard.
I'll not be sweeping in front of your house again. You can bet on that.
Now, get out, you bastard, you!
What did you do to him?
He's acting like some rabid wolf.
He was born a wolf.
You made him rabid, not me.
Good boy, Scott Mary.
You've always been underestimated.
I'm the first to recognise it and to ask you to excuse me.
Bring me the broom.
- What?
- I said the broom.
The same one you gave me to sweep this pigsty.
Scott...go back to the stable.
After you, Marshal.
Pigs go before.
- I'm gonna show you...
- Marshal...
Don't go anything foolish. Not now.
What you been needing is a beating, Scott.
With a big, big stick.
A big stick, huh?
I used to have one once.
Watch this.
Hold it, Murray.
No!
Mm...
Scott...
This isn't what I wanted for you.
Come away.
Go to hell. All of you!
You're pretty damn fast, Scott Mary.
- Not bad.
- May I go and take care of the other one?
Go ahead.
Was he your friend? He the one that showed you how to draw?
- Yes, that was him. Murph Allan.
- Murph Allan?
That's right. He works in the stable down the street. Ron Miller's.
Murph Allan SHORT.
NOW I remember.
He's gotten so old he can't wear a gun anymore, huh?
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.
He was a marshal in Abilene once.
Ran me out of town with a rifle at my back.
It was a long time ago, but I won't forget it.
You know, maybe he was right.
I should take your gun away and send you back to the stable.
Don't try it, Talby.
It's too late.
Yeah.
It's too late.
Oh...
You've made yourself a lot of enemies, Mr Talby.
Thanks.
Been hit, Talby?
The old wound hasn't healed yet.
Who was he?
Is he with us or against us?
Why did he save your life?
Pretty soon we'll find out.
Gentlemen...
Owen, what's the idea?
Why did you save the life of that man, Owen?
We've brought you here to kill him.
I've travelled for 500 miles to get here.
And I couldn't let a barber steal my work from me.
Then you must have known it was Talby.
- And you went and saved him.
- For my $10,000.
Well. Since you're so sure you're gonna kill him... here's a third of it now.
- The rest after.
- Mm-hm...
It may cost you a little more this way.
Drink to my health, Nigel?
Now...this was Corbitt's.
Now it's yours.
It's a great rifle, in the hands of a good shot.
Owen is able to shoot ten buffalo, riding full speed.
Poor old Corbitt was an expert only with a razor.
Nigel...the weapon that's gonna kill me hasn't been invented yet.
Who knows?
I've heard that you're pretty quick with a pistol.
And I don't want to question that...
Talby.
But who knows if you'd take on a real duel?
You mean one of those games where they count off paces?
Almost.
Except on horseback.
And with front-loading rifles.
You got a reason for this?
I've already told you once, Talby...
- You've made a lot of enemies.
- I know.
All right. I'll kill you any way you want.
Tomorrow morning.
At sunrise.
No.No,no.No.
No, please.
Don't do it.
It...it...it...it wasn't my idea.
Oh...don't. No, no...
Don't ruin me. No.
It wasn't me. I didn't want to.
I'll do whatever you want.
You know something, Murray?
- I don't like this place anymore.
- No?
Pretty soon, I'll be opening up a new saloon.
You know what I'm gonna call it?
The Forty-Five.
In honour of this one.
Uh-huh.
I'm dissolving our partnership.
Now I want my half.
Your thousand dollars?
Now come on, Murray. You know this place is worth at least 40,000.
Now, I'm not good at mathematics, but I'm sure you can figure it out.
But you gave me...
No, no, no, no. Whatever you want.
$20,000. But I don't have it on me right now. I...
- A note for payment on demand. Sign it.
- Yes.
That's it. I'll fill in the amount later.
Mr Talby...
Here's your receipt.
Where did you find that pistol?
That? Oh, the marshal gave it to me.
Huh...
Who are you now?
Murph Allan Short?
Or are you simply plain Murph?
One day I made my choice.
You can never go back.
Tell the truth.
You don't like my being with Talby.
You watch out.
They've been saying that you're faster than him.
You may be faster and quicker with your eye and your hand, but...in order to survive, you need something else.
- Experience.
- You're trying to turn me against him.
Talby should be about 45.
That's a bad age for a gunman.
Every day you feel yourself getting slower.
Your muscles still react, but your reflexes aren't as quick.
Talby's done the same as a lot of others before him.
He's taken a helper.
Somebody young who shoots for him when things get too difficult.
That's a lie.
But even if it was true, what's bad in that?
The day will come when you'll be throwing too big a shadow on him.
This is his last chance.
His last city.
Either he sets himself up here for life or he leaves his skin.
I don't believe anymore in your ridiculous fairy tales.
Scott...
Never hammer a hammer.
Just...caress it.
And that's just what Talby said.
- I don't get it.
- Have you ever seen him draw?
But, Murph... What's the point?
That's one of his tricks.
You shoot like this.
And he shoots like...this.
But if you hold the barrel like that... he'll make sure... that you don't stop the drum.
Of course, that's why
Talby's modified the hammer.
He can fire six shots in the time it takes you to fire...three.
And he's more accurate.
It's all in the gun.
Was it he who chose your gun?
Yeah, Murph. It's a beautiful weapon.
Beautiful, huh?
But the barrel is seven inches long.
Huh... The best size for me.
Have you seen Talby's gun?
Yes, it's one like mine.
Erm...only it's missing the sight.
Exactly.
It hasn't got a sight because he has sawed off the barrel.
You have two more inches of barrel.
Two more inches to draw.
You know what that means?
Look, I've had more than enough of this talk.
But you think you're putting me against Talby only because of a pistol much shorter than mine?
Think of me, when the day comes, if you find yourself face to face with Talby.
- I'm going.
- Listen, my boy.
If anything should happen to me,
I've hidden a package there, in that box where you used to keep your money.
Bah...
Take it...if you remember me.
But leave it there, if you still think I'm an old lunatic.
Forget it!
Place your bets. Place your bets.
Fourteen for the gentleman.
- Deuce or house...
- Round and round and round she goes.
Where she stops, nobody knows.
Get your bets in, please.
Bets in. Next round. That's right. Right in.
Looks like you won, sir.
Well...you're very lucky.
Here you are.
Two deputies are outside.
They'll get what they're looking for.
Thank you, Gwen.
Two deputies are outside.
What do we do?
Stand guard at the upstairs window.
You can go out the back where I came in.
Be careful. These guys aren't just cowboys.
You go ahead.
What do you want?
You're going to get yourself killed, Scott.
- Shut up. I don't believe you.
- Wait and see.
He'll step in just one second too late to be in danger.
- Look, I'm going. I've had enough.
- Listen. Nobody'll shoot at your back.
I just wanted you to know that.
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Hey, Cross.
Looking for someone?
What do you say?
Want to leave things up to the pistols?
You begin, Cross.
I'm a deputy. You got that clear?
I represent the law.
You're just like any other gunman paid to kill me.
All right. I'm ready.
Scott...everything all right?
Put away your spitfire, Talby.
It's all over.
In this town, there ain't no more deputies with a fast pistol.
Come on inside.
We gotta celebrate.
His songs were sad... but he knew how to play.
He won't play anymore.
I don't think this is a night to celebrate.
When did you get so sentimental, Scott Mary?
Beginning now.
Scott Mary. Will you come with me?
My father wants to talk to you.
Is that so?
I remember being chased away.
I know. You're right.
But it's different now.
Will you? They're waiting for us at the old mill.
Please...
We want you to come over...
On our side.
So we can bring...some order back to Clifton, which is just as much your town as ours.
I've known your order for more than 20 years... but you're wasting your time.
You're right, Scott.
But you know me well.
And you should think about the fact that I'm on this side.
Our worst problem, at the moment, is Talby.
Eliminate him and then we can think about the rest.
No, Murph.
As far as I know
Talby's done only justice.
He may have killed, but only because they made trouble.
He'll kill anyone who comes between himself and his goal.
Good or bad alike.
But I'll chase him out of Clifton, like I chased him out of Abilene
20 years ago...Scott.
I don't want to see the two of us... face to face.
Then just forget Talby.
Step aside.
Scott.
I told you he wouldn't accept.
Much worse for him.
The bastard is about to die.
And then...it's your turn.
Why, you son of a...
- Eileen.
- I'm here, Scott.
I made it. I killed Scott Mary!
'Got him!
- Scott.
- There. The two of them!
Ah...the plan worked out.
Come on, let's go.
Murderers!
I hope he's dead. The bastard.
You're going to hell, Turner.
Find out down there.
No!
Well, this time it's nothing to do with self-defence, Talby.
It's murder.
Hand me your gun.
We'll see what the jury has to say, Nigel.
You won, Talby.
Obviously, it wasn't just luck.
This country is developing.
And Clifton along with it.
But now, maybe more than ever before, you need a judge...as your friend.
What's done inside the law is sometimes safer than what's done outside the law.
And I'm to believe that this Scott Mary passed from broomstick to pistol, huh?
Just like that.
Absolutely. When Scott Mary used his pistol, boy, what a spectacle.
Scott Mary, the wonder boy.
Last three weeks he's been enjoying over at Vivian Skill's house.
Doctor Cullen says, in order to extract the bullet from his right arm, he had to cut a muscle.
In fact, we'll be holding the glass to his mouth, this great gun, so he can drink.
It's a lot of bull.
When you drop dead or become too feeble to shoot, you get a name as the greatest shot in the West.
Yeah. Just like Doc Holliday, for instance.
When he died, that gun of his became a legend.
You know, if Scott Mary should stay paralysed, there's lot of folks gonna think he was able to light a match at ten paces' distance...
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Champagne.
We've got to celebrate.
You're looking good.
How's your arm?
I can take care of myself.
You're faster than before.
Because I exercised.
I pushed myself out of bed to do it.
To your recovery.
The marshal's star.
Who did it go to?
There is a new marshal, ain't there?
Yeah.
Murph...Allan...Short.
He...might make a good sheriff.
A tough one.
In Clifton, I owe nothing to nobody.
But to Murph, I'm very indebted.
Talby!
Talby!
I hear you.
As from today, it's forbidden to wear firearms in the city.
Unbuckle your belt and let it drop.
You better come and get it.
I'm coming.
I may not be as fast as I used to be, but you could lose again on account of me.
No!
I gave you plenty of warning, Talby.
Now I'm gonna get you.
"Dear Scott,
"When you read this,
"I will be dead.
"The only thing I can leave you
"is this pistol. It's an old one,
"but it belonged to Doc Holliday.
"It's also been mine. Now it's yours.
"It's endowed with the tricks of three generations of gunmen.
"The firing pin's been modified
"so that all you have to do is think about shooting.
"The trigger fires immediately.
"This pistol is now in your hands, Scott,
"but if you still think the way Talby does,
Throw it away."
Scott.
- Hey, Scott.
- I'm here.
They're coming over here.
You're surrounded by the gunmen of Talby, Scott.
They might kill you, Scott.
Don't be worried.
Come on out, Scott Mary.
Talby wants to speak to you.
Now, are you coming out immediately?
Or must we beg you?
I'm coming out...but you'd better not shoot.
You never should beg another man.
That's the first lesson
I learned from Talby.
Don't move. Drop your gun, Scott.
Yeah, friend. You mustn't trust anyone.
That's the second lesson.
- Did you see him?
- No. He's not even at Vivian Skill's.
Never get between a gun and its target.
The right bullet at the right time.
Talby. Now it's your turn.
There's nobody out here left to be killed in your place.
A challenge shouldn't be refused, no matter what it might mean to you.
Remember saying that to me?
Sure I do, Scott Mary.
You sure you want it this way, Scottie?
You saw what happened to Murph.
But you won't do it to me.
Did you go to church to pray?
If I waited for you in the saloon, the sun wouldn't be in your eyes.
I don't believe your tricks will be enough.
My gun will do it.
That's where you're mistaken.
If I was alone, maybe you could've done it.
But not against me and Murph.
Now I got a pistol that's equal to yours.
Sight missing, calibrated perfectly.
Your last lesson, Scottie...
When you start killing, you can't stop it.
Any time you're ready.
Find me a horse, Scottie.
I'll get out of your way.
No. I'd be stupid to help you.
I've learned your lessons like a good boy.
When a man has been wounded, you've gotta end it.
Or it might be that later he'll try to kill you.
You won, Murph.
Scott.
Scott!

The land at first.
Mountains thrust forth from the molten darkness of the earth.
Mountain and valley.
The virgin West.
High plateau and red rock of sandstone.
Wilderness West.
Prairie land, rolling on and on to the end of sight.
Oh, pioneer West.
What fervent dreams lay half-buried in this land of promise?
Dreams crushed by a cruel nature
or the lance of an Indian warrior.
Every page in history must have its beginning,
and ours takes us to the year 1867.
An army that had fought in the war between the states,
that had bravely battled in many an Indian campaign,
now patrolled the West in a time of peace,
with ever-present thoughts of home.
The Indian was back on the reservation,
where the Peace Commission of 1867 had met with various warlike tribes
and secured certain promises from them.
In return, papers were given to Indians,
certifying them to be good citizens who would obey the laws of the land.
Many gifts were distributed.
Beads,
pieces of cloth,
ammunition,
and war-surplus rifles.
Naturally, these rifles were quite unfamiliar to the Indians.
Of course, it was understood these weapons were to be used
solely for the purpose of hunting game.
The leaves turned early in that year.
It could be a long, hard winter.
The signs were everywhere.
In the high country, the morning frost would sometimes last until afternoon.
Buffalo were feeding ravenously.
Beaver were damming and storing with strange vigour.
Horses and dogs were becoming shaggy-haired as never before.
And it could be sensed in the booming, bustling mining town of Denver.
Most historians agree that the events leading to the Battle of Whiskey Hills
and the subsequent disaster at Quicksand Bottoms
began here in Denver, at a miners' meeting.
Such meetings were frequent
and held as part of the political fabric of the town.
But the meeting of November 4th had a marked air of grim foreboding.
Quiet! I got an announcement
I gotta make.
In 10 days from now the city of Denver will be bone dry.
No!
Not one drop of whiskey anywhere.
Speak up! We can't hear ya!
I said Denver will be bone dry in 10 days.
You heard what I said.
I said plumb out and I mean out!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I thought Bert Keeler was gettin' in a big order, but he was sick.
Sam Buford was gettin' in 60 barrels, but Sam got his foot caught in that bear trap.
He didn't tell Shelby to get his 50 barrels, so...
So with four big orders outta reach, there ain't nobody else put in.
- Now, take this here saloon alone.
- That's all there is.
Look at it. And there's already been snow flurries along Gunner's Pass.
If we get ourselves a hard, cold winter, there won't be a wagonload of whiskey in Denver till spring.
And it could be a late spring.
Hold it! So what we need, we need us a plan.
Hey! What does Oracle say?
Afternoon, gents.
Oracle, what about this here winter?
The buffalo are feedin' ravenous.
The beaver are workin' somethin' fierce.
The horses and dogs are growin' shaggy-haired like never before.
What else? Have you seen anything else?
Yep, I had me a vision on, uh...
Oh, it come on me two days ago.
- Well?
- What'd you see?
Uh...
Why, thank you.
At the feed store, it was.
Come on more sudden than most.
I was lookin' up, and there it was.
- What was it?
- Snow.
Heavy, white snow.
Yep, it's gonna be a long, hard winter.
And when a long, hard winter hits us, by damn, she hits.
- No wagons gettin' through, no supplies?
- And no whiskey.
- You know.
- Yep.
It come on me two days ago.
We gotta have a plan.
- What kinda plan, Oracle?
- Uh, let me just...
Hallelujah!
There! Now I see it!
I see all of us a-comin' together.
I, um...
I see us... puttin' all the whiskey orders into one big shipment for the whole winter.
I see us gettin' an ironclad guarantee from, uh... from some good company like, uh, uh...
Thank you. Like Frank Wallingham... to get them drinkables to our saloons right now afore the snows hit.
I, uh...
I see a wagon train, a whole wagon train loaded up with whiskey a-comin' down on us from Julesburg.
I see 20...
40 wagons.
- Are you Hobbs?
- I am, sir.
- Did you print that?
- I did, sir.
- And who, may I ask, are you?
- Frank Wallingham.
I see. How do you do?
Won't you sit down, Mr. Wallingham?
No. I wanna know why.
Why did you do it?
I've done nothing but print the truth.
600 barrels of Philadelphia-brewed whiskey moving from here to Denver.
Yes. Then what happens when the Indians get wind of 40 wagons full of firewater?
- They'll scalp us from head to foot.
- Indians don't read newspapers.
- Who says they don't?
- The Indian problem's all settled.
Haven't you read the Peace Commissioners' report?
All right, then. Worse than Indians!
Revenue agents!
Oh... Haven't paid your federal taxes, huh?
Of course I pay my taxes!
I'm an honest businessman.
And a good Republican.
But give those snoopers a taste of honey and they'll swarm down from every direction but up.
- You have my sympathy.
- Sympathy?
It's because
I didn't advertise in your rag,
- because I didn't give you free whiskey.
- You'd better get outta here.
You listen to me. I've got every cent that I own tied up in this cargo.
By damn, I'm gonna see it gets to Denver.
You can print that, sir.
I shall.
I'm sending a telegram to
Colonel Gearhart at Fort Russell.
I am demanding an entire troop of
US cavalry as escort. Print that, sir!
- I shall.
- Good.
You should also put in your paper that I say that any tax snooper, white road agent or Red Indian that comes near my wagons had better be wearin' cast-iron underwear.
And if you try to blackmail me one more time,
I'll come back here and cram this down your lyin' throat.
Good day, sir.
- Smythe.
- Yes, sir.
What's the name of that temperance woman? Martindale?
Massingale, sir.
Cora Templeton Massingale.
Oh, yes, Massingale.
Do you know where she is?
On a tour of New England last month, sir.
Then Boston, to Philadelphia, to Trenton.
She may be a female hellcat about whiskey, sir, but a fine figure of a woman, with eyes...
- Smythe.
- Sir?
I asked you where she is.
Oh. At Fort Russell, sir.
She got there yesterday.
Fort Russell?
Send a telegram to her. Mark it urgent.
The editor of the Julesburg Gazette was quite right.
Indians did not read newspapers.
It's a matter of speculation therefore
just how they did hear of the whiskey cargo.
There were couriers, of course,
and there was the smoke signal, first used by the ancient Greeks and Hebrews.
How the Indians acquired it from them is of no importance here. But they did.
Nor was smoke used exclusively.
A crude mirror, painted stone,
carved bark of trees were quite popular.
And a peculiarly knotted string.
The message was always transmitted in code.
A code which no white man was ever able to break.
Regardless of what method was used by the Indians,
it's a matter of record that news of the whiskey train
became common knowledge within 48 hours
to every tribe of every
North American Plains Indian.
We are still unaware
why only one tribe rode out to investigate the firewater train.
But it's supposed there was competition among the various tribes for the honour.
It is for us to make reconnaissance of wagon-train position.
It is for me to make such reconnaissance.
He is chief of Sioux.
And I am chief of Crow.
We will do it.
You will not do it. I will do it.
You and I are blocked.
Yes, we are.
Authorities agree that personal disputes among the Plains tribes
were settled very quickly.
Just south of Cheyenne stood Fort Russell,
famous throughout the West as a bastion of military strength
and the home of the rugged, disciplined, frontier soldier.
Stand up, stand up and sing it
Beat it on the drum
Stand, stand up and sing it
Down with demon rum
Stand up, stand up and sing it
Raise our banners high
Victory is coming

And now, ladies, I give you once again
Mrs. Cora Templeton Massingale.
Oh, thank you, thank you!
Your reception has warmed my heart.
Ladies, you have heard it said that man is all mouth and muscle, that he is dirty boots on one end and a dirty mind on the other.
Don't you believe it.
If we are to enjoy equal rights with man, we must respect him, and, if we are to respect him, then we must save him from himself and from the poison of alcoholic spirits!
- Do you agree?
- Yes!
Then let the world know it.
Let us spread the word of emancipation to every corner of this great nation.
Emancipation! Let me hear it!
Emancipation!
- Freedom for women!
- Freedom for women!
Shout it out, ladies!
Women can remake the world!
Women can remake the world!
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword
His truth is marching on
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
Ladies! Let me hear it!
Emancipation!
- Shout it out!
- Freedom for women!
- Once again!
- Women can remake the world!
What do you think, Sergeant?
I hate to say it, Colonel, but it sounds like
Sioux or Cheyenne war cries to me, sir.
An uprising at the fort?
- Ridiculous.
- Yes, sir.
I can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps
His truth is marching on
Those are bugles, sir.
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is marching on
That's cannon, sir!
- Form a skirmish line to the left!
- Form a skirmish line to the left! Ho!
In the beauty of the lilies
Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me
Draw carbines! Ho!
Company B returning. Open the gates.
Glory, glory...
- My God! She's on fire, sir!
- Charge!
Glory, glory, hallelujah
His truth is...
- You!
- Good evening, Colonel.
Bandmaster, front and centre.
You're under arrest.
This entire band is under arrest.
You're confined to quarters until further notice.
Dismissed!
Who are the idiots who fired those cannon?
- Sergeant Perkins.
- Private McIntosh.
- Private Johnson.
- Private Williams.
Report to my quarters tomorrow morning at nine.
Yes, sir.
Brady.
Return carbines.
In file, prepare to dismount.
Dismount.
Madam. Article twelve, section seven, paragraph two of army regulations states: "Government property cannot be used for political demonstrations."
Sir, we have never designated our movement to be political.
Article nine, section two, paragraph four of army regulations clearly states that civilian meetings may be held at military installations when permission has been granted by the commanding officer.
The commanding officer? I see.
Forgive me, madam. We've been on patrol for six days. I'm somewhat weary.
Captain Slater gave you permission in my absence?
He did.
- Brady, I want this mess cleaned up.
- Yes, sir.
Ladies, I see you have transport.
You'll be escorted back to town.
The party will leave in five minutes exactly.
- Madam, do you have quarters here?
- I have.
Then you may retire to those quarters, madam, and remake the world on some other occasion. Good evening.
- Buell.
- Sir!
- Buell, get me Captain Slater.
- Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
Did the colonel wish to see me?
- Where the hell did you come from?
- I couldn't help but overhear, sir.
I want the colonel to know that what happened tonight, the way it happened, was so quick that I hardly had time to marshal my forces.
Did you give that woman permission for a temperance rally?
Yes and no. That is, I had no idea it would get outta hand, so to speak, sir.
What the hell did you expect?
Give a woman an acorn and you're up to your rump in oak trees.
That's very true, sir. And I am sorry.
If only they hadn't started moving... that is to say, marching.
- Led by the Fort Russell band.
- I'd say that Mrs. Massingale led them.
The band came next.
You see, they were playing
The Battle Hymn of the Republic, and every time they got to "Hallelujah"... boom!
- I'm sorry, sir, about the cannon.
- Spare me the details.
Slater, what if word got out that Fort Russell stood behind a temperance movement?
That I, a line officer, could ever support such a movement?
Well, you got a point there, sir.
- And you let them go right ahead.
- Well, I, uh...
Actually, I was trying to keep the colonel's daughter out of it, for your sake.
What's my daughter got to do with this?
- Well, your daughter...
- Please.
I beg you not to hold
Paul responsible, Father.
It was my fault. I was the one who...
She was not. And I refuse to allow her to accept responsibility. I was the one.
- You were not.
- Yes, I was.
Paul...
- In my own quarters.
- We're sorry, Father, truly we are.
- B-but...
- But what?
But...
But may I point out, sir, that you have the only private quarters at the fort, and we didn't expect you back so soon.
It's true that Miss Gearhart has her own quarters, sir, but I thought that my presence there might put her in a compromising position.
Since my own quarters are shared, sir...
Slater! Answer me.
- I'm trying to, sir.
- He isn't either, not truthfully.
He wasn't keeping me out of the temperance meeting,
I was keeping him.
I thought he might try to stop the marching, so this seemed a lovely...
I mean, a way... to divert him.
Louise.
You don't really mind, do you, darling?
I mean, you certainly couldn't have enjoyed yourself any the less.
Louise!
Well, I'd do anything for
Cora Massingale and her cause.
And if you've hurt her, Father,
I'll never forgive you.
- Slater.
- Yes, sir.
The women, the rally, the cannon.
I'll chalk it all up to your inexperience.
Thank you, sir.
But you cannot... you simply cannot use my quarters for... for this sort of thing.
I'm sorry, sir.
Why don't you just get on with it and marry the girl?
Stop all this lying around?
Well, the colonel knows my feelings about that, sir.
The West is no life for a woman.
The West is no life for anyone.
Wind, dust, Indians.
I hate the wind. I hate the dust.
And I hate the Indians.
Yes, I know. And until my transfer comes through to an eastern post, I'll...
I'll drink to that.
To you and Louise and a transfer.
There you are.
- I can't, sir.
- Why not?
I haven't said good night to Louise yet.
The liquor on my breath...
- She knows you drink, she knows I drink.
- I know that, sir, but...
If you had seen her at that meeting tonight. She heard Mrs. Massingale.
Her eyes all lit up.
Frightened hell out of me, sir.
All right. Go to her.
Do whatever it is you do.
- Thank you, sir.
- But not on my bear rug!
No. No, sir.
Slater.
Here. Escort for a wagon train.
Fella named Wallingham.
Taxpayer, good Republican.
I want you to figure out how to intercept the train and escort them to Denver.
Denver? That'll take over a week.
I promised Louise...
I know, I know. She'll cry, of course.
Just tell her duty is a cruel master.
Yes, sir. Duty... is a cruel... master.
Yes, sir. Thank you. Good night, sir.
- Colonel Gearhart?
Colonel?
Colonel?
I, uh...
I don't wish to intrude on your privacy, Colonel, but... this is vitally important.
I'm taking a bath.
The sight of a gentleman taking his bath is not foreign to a woman who's been widowed twice.
Well... Would you care to have a seat?
No, thank you. What I have to say is best said standing.
You'll forgive me if I don't get up.
It's not necessary.
Mrs. Massingale,
I've already told Captain Slater
I won't hold him responsible.
In your case, I've written off the entire incident. So now...
That's not why I'm here.
I have received a telegram from Julesburg that distresses me deeply.
It says a train of 40 wagons left there yesterday bound for Denver and that you are to furnish military escort for that train.
Is that information correct?
I received a request to that effect, yes.
Were you aware, Colonel, that the cargo of those 40 wagons is alcohol?
- No, ma'am.
- Well, now you know.
Tell me, Colonel, are you going to furnish escort?
Yes, ma'am.
I respectfully request that you reconsider, Colonel.
In the name of suffering humanity,
I implore you to halt that wagon train and destroy this poison that they're carrying.
What you ask is... What you ask is impossible. The cargo is legal.
I have no grounds nor wish to destroy civilian property.
And now, madam, will you leave me to my bath?
Is it legal to sell whiskey to Indians?
Who said anything...
Who said anything about Indians?
The cargo is headed for Denver, for businessmen there.
- How do you know?
- I have the owner's word for it.
Mr. Frank Wallingham, who is an acquaintance, a taxpayer, and a good Republican.
Well, in that case, you force me to take action.
Our movement has many friends in many high places.
Men such as... Horace Greeley.
Is that a threat?
You can consider it such if you like.
My conscience forces me to make it.
And mine demands that I do my duty.
So be it.
May I impose upon your kindness for directions to the post telegraph office?
Mrs. Massingale,
I'll do better than that.
I'll furnish you transportation to the Cheyenne telegraph office, where your messages are sure to get out twice as quickly.
Thank you.
Call on me again if there's anything further I can do.
You're a very generous man, Colonel.
Right turn! Ho!
Three telegrams, sir, just arrived.
Read them.
"The Governor of Colorado is against liquor and its vicissitudes, but his position makes it impossible to take a position in the matter of whiskey cargo to Denver."
"The Adjutant General's office is grateful to Women's Temperance for the splendid morale factor they have upon the American soldier. However..."
Whiskey matters must be left to commanders in the field.
"Respectfully."
"Mr. Horace Greeley has ever championed the noble cause of temperance and suffrage, but is unable to interfere with constituted authority of the West."
Buell. Give these to Mrs. Massingale with my compliments and arrange transportation for her.
Her movement is moving.
Yes, sir.
On the morning of November 16th,
the Wallingham wagon train was moving along north of the South Platte River.
At the head was its owner,
Frank Wallingham,
and its wagon master, Rafe Pike.
To the rear was a group of Irish teamsters
under the leadership of one Kevin O'Flaherty.
The Slater patrol was turning south
towards the course of the Wallingham train,
and a band of Sioux warriors was on the move,
led by the great Chief 5 Barrels
and his sub-chief, Walks-Stooped-Over,
who was also known in certain
Indian circles as Sky Eyes,
due to the blue colour of his eyes,
the heritage apparently of some slight, uh... irregularity in his ancestry.
- Please, Father, be reasonable.
- No.
If Mrs. Massingale wants a farewell meeting, she may use the mess hall.
But I will not attend.
But we're not asking you to take the pledge.
Although a bit of temperance might make you happier.
No red-blooded drinking man is more temperate than I am.
And I'm happy. I'm damned happy.
If you would only try to understand Mrs. Massingale, a woman who's lost two husbands to alcohol.
They drank themselves into an early grave.
I can only wonder why.
Do you absolutely refuse, Father, to attend this meeting?
I do, and I'm beginning to regret giving you the hall.
The least you can do is release the post band.
No.
- But we can't sing hymns without them.
- Good.
- There's no point in having the meeting.
- Splendid.
Please, Father.
It means so much to us.
And Mrs. Massingale is leaving.
We may never see her again.
- Can I depend on that?
- Oh, I never go back on my word.
I shall say goodbye at the meeting.
Well, maybe the trombone.
Thank you, Father. You're a dear.
- And the drums?
- No. No drums.
Good afternoon.
Stand up, stand up and sing it
Raise our banners high
Victory is coming
Victory is nigh, believers
Victory is nigh
- What's goin' on over there?
- Singing, sir.
- You have guards at every exit?
- As you ordered, sir.
You'd better double the guards.
Check the exits yourself.
If they break out of that hall in marching formation...
- That's what happened to Captain Slater.
- Yes, sir.
Ladies, our enemy has two heads.
First, the enslavement of women by men.
Yes.
And second, the enslavement of men themselves by the remorseless tyrant alcohol.
- Are we willing to fight these enemies?
- Yes.
Then we must reach out for freedom, and tear this tyrant from the lips of man.
Now, ladies, I have an announcement to make to each and every one of you who has touched my heart.
The time has come for me to say goodbye to all you wonderful women...
Thank God!
Something has occurred which requires my presence elsewhere.
- I am going to the city of Denver.
- Denver?
I know, I know. You ask me
"Why Denver?" I'll tell you why.
Because 40 wagons of whiskey are going to Denver right now.
40 wagons of poison for those poor misguided citizens, and no one in high office seems to care.
Well, I do!
And I shall shout it over and over until the mountains of Colorado come tumbling down to the Denver saloons.
- Will your hearts go with me?
- Yes!
- Is our cause just and righteous?
- Yes!
- I've doubled the guards, sir.
- I want you to guard the main entrance.
- Do I have your blessings?
- Yes!
No!
No! I cannot let you go to that sinful city alone.
If you'll have me, Mrs. Massingale,
I'll go with you.
Get over there.
Drag my daughter off that platform.
Oh, how wonderful, ladies!
- Oh, ladies, we'll all go to Denver.
- Yes!
- We'll make it our marching song.
- Yes!
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
No more wine or beer
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
We will have no fear
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
Raise our banners high
Denver, we are coming
Denver will be dry, believers
Denver will be dry
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
Down with demon rum
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
Denver, here we come
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
Lift our banners high...
Well, Buell?
Just... tryin' to get my wind back, sir.
Knocked me flat, sir.
Did you hear what that... woman said, sir?
I did.
- But, sir...
- "But, sir" what?
How can we let them go through with it, sir?
March to Denver through country like this, without escort or protection?
What if they come upon a bunch of Indians, sir?
I suggest we pray for the Indians.
Can the... the army refuse escort, sir?
From now on, the army will do what I tell it to do.
What, uh...
What do you intend to do, sir?
- Good morning, Miss Gearhart.
- Good morning, Sergeant Buell.
Go away.
Louise, will you please go away?
This should make you feel better.
Nice hot milk.
What's going on out there?
Will you stop that infernal uproar?
You will not under any circumstances go off with that... that woman.
Yes, Father.
To Denver or anyplace else.
I want that clearly understood.
Yes, Father.
Now will you please leave me alone?
Is he better?
I'm afraid not.
Louise, go and get me some more blankets. Lots of them.
I want him to perspire. We will sweat the poison out of his system.
Blankets. All right, Mrs. Massingale.
- Mrs. Massingale!
- Lie back.
- Madam...
- Back.
Now... just be quiet, please.
Don't exert yourself.
- Madam, we have a surgeon.
- Just relax.
Let the blood flow.
Now tell me, Colonel, does the pain centre lie about here?
Look, Mrs...
- It's a little higher.
- A little higher. Yes, of course.
- About this march, Mrs. Massingale...
- Just unwind.
This march to Denver... impossible.
Right here, at this junction,
Colonel, a series of cords.
And beneath them, intertwined nerves like fine silk threads.
Matters of... transportation.
Rattlesnakes...
All connected up to here where the pain centre lies.
Examine my position.
Consider, if you will...
- Oh, that feels good.
- That's the key point.
First we rub gently downwards, and then upwards, and then downwards again.
Now you're beginning to relax.
I can feel it in my fingers.
I wish I could help you, but...
Army regulations.
Article 12, section 26, paragraph...
That's right.
Relax. Relax.
Company, attention!
Company, attention!
Good morning, Colonel Gearhart.
Good morning, Father.
Morning, ladies.
Who are those men at the gate?
Husbands.
Not all the ladies are single.
What do they want here?
The ladies are takin' their wagons away.
They want the colonel to do something about it, sir.
- Sir.
- Well?
Does the colonel intend...
I mean to say, sir, will the escort party...
Sir, do you really intend to go through with this thing?
Buell, you've got a great deal to learn about military science.
A simple matter of objective and stratagem.
Objective - get rid of these damn women.
- Stratagem...
- Take 'em to Denver, sir?
- Mount up, Buell. Mount up.
- Yes, sir.
- Move them out, Brady.
- Yes, sir.
Twos left!
Right turn! Ho!
Right turn! Ho!
Right turn! Ho!
Left turn! Ho!
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
No more wine or beer
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
No more whiskey here
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
- Buell!
- Sir!
One bugler, just one bugler joins in with that singing, I'll have him shot!
Yes, sir.
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
Down with demon rum
Stand up...
It might be prudent right at this moment
to get our bearings upon this historic arena.
Julesburg is here.
To the southwest along the South
Platte River is the city of Denver.
North of it we find Fort Russell.
The Wallingham wagon train had moved to this point on the river.
The first cavalry patrol under Captain Slater... here.
The second cavalry patrol under Colonel Gearhart... here,
with, of course, the temperance marchers.
And the band of Sioux Indians... here.
In the city of Denver, another miners' meeting was being held.
Hold it! Hold it down.
This meetin' is called to order.
Tell me who called this meetin', what for, and what's all the hollering about!
I did. Clayton, we gotta face the facts.
There's been no word from that wagon train in two weeks.
- That's right.
- There's snow already at Grizzly Pass.
- Afternoon, gents.
- Oracle, the thing is we, uh...
- We got trouble.
- You know?
That wagon train may not never get to you.
- Why not?
- Why, thank you.
It was all set on comin' to me.
I, uh... I was lookin' up and, uh... uh...
Thank you.
Hallelu...
- There! Now I see it!
- What?
Uh... Injuns.
I see hundreds of Injuns.
You see anything else, Oracle?
- I think, uh...
- Hallelu...
- I see men... I see men on the march.
- Cavalry?
Course not.
This ain't no time for children.
I see men, men carryin', uh... picks and, uh... axes and, uh... uh... uh... shovels.
- Well, who are they?
- Denver citizens' militia.
A-marchin' out there to intercept that wagon train and see that whiskey gets home.
Hold on, Oracle. We're workin' men.
We're miners. We ain't Injun fighters.
I ain't marchin' up any rivers, sleeping on the rocks and cookin' on campfires.
You gonna spend the whole winter in Denver without no whiskey?
At dawn the morning of November 17th,
the second cavalry patrol was heading due south for Denver,
with of course the temperance marchers.
The Wallingham wagon train was turning west.
The first cavalry patrol was moving fast to intercept it.
The Denver citizens' militia was making an easterly crossing
of the South Platte River,
while the Sioux Indians were coming down from the north,
picking up more braves all the time.
Whoa!
For the beloved love of all the saints,
St Pat and Mike and Bridget, and all the souls in purgatory, not again!
Call yourself a wagon!
You rotten collection of wood!
You ain't fit for carryin' swill to vultures!
Whoa!
All right, O'Flaherty. What's your excuse this time, you ignorant immigrant lump?
Oh, lump, is it? Well...
All things being equal, we'll be havin' a word with your lordship.
I told you I am not a lordship!
Can't expect an Irish serf to forget the habits of a lifetime, now.
- Just get on with it.
- Well, now.
We, the Irish Teamsters, have a petition of grievances.
We state in plain and simple terms the bad conditions under which we've been forced to labour, and do hereby raise formal objection to the followin', to wit: travel hours and harnessin', unharnessin', carin' for horses, loadin', unloadin', beddin', guard duty, poor drinkin' water, order of wagons in march, and, might I add, in addition to no whiskey ration whatsoever in a whole cargo of whiskey.
Now, suppose these grievances of yours aren't answered?
- What'll you do? Strike?
- That's an ugly word to a workin' man.
- But it would be considered.
- Ah...
Well, in that case, O'Flaherty, you strike.
- Strike.
- And who, might I ask, pray tell me, are you goin' to get to drive your sweatin', rotten wagons?
- There are your grievances.
- We've struck off 12 more copies.
Exploiter! Capitalist!
Highbinder! Profiteer!
Mr. Wallingham, I presume.
Captain Slater at your service.
Colonel Gearhart sends his compliments.
He's most happy to comply with your request for escort to Denver.
Good for Colonel Gearhart.
Have you seen any Indians?
A scout informed me...
There aren't any Indians here. Haven't you heard of the Peace Commission?
With a cargo like this, you've got to be sure, damn sure!
Indians, revenue agents, temperance women.
- Oh, you know.
- Know what?
- About Cora Massingale.
- Where?
It's all right. She's not here.
She's at Fort Russell giving temperance lectures.
- Are you positive she's at Fort Russell?
- I positively guarantee it.
She isn't any nearer your cargo than... than the Indians are.
- Hope it's hot.
Wait till we get you in.
Oh!
Sergeant, I, uh...
We've got a morale problem, sir.
Take care of it, Buell.
I think the colonel will have to root it out, sir, right at the core.
The ladies, sir, are taking baths... in the nude.
Mrs. Massingale,
I'd like a word with you.
Would you mind calling some other time,
Colonel? I'm taking a bath.
I am well aware that you're taking a bath.
I don't care how dirty you are.
I will not have you ladies bathing in the nude.
There's no other way I know of,
Colonel.
The opportunity was there and... who knows what tomorrow might bring?
Especially now that we've changed our plans.
- Changed your plans?
- Yes, Colonel.
You mean you want to go back to Cheyenne now?
Don't be ridiculous. Of course not.
We want only to meet the wagon train.
But you are meeting the train.
That's why we're going to Denver.
But we want to meet it long before it reaches Denver.
- That's not possible.
- On the contrary.
We now intend to intercept the wagon train along the River Platte.
You what?
In a clash of wills, Colonel, he who shouts loudest is lost.
Madam...
If I understand you correctly, you are going to lead your ladies through unsettled Plains country
- along the South Platte River trail.
- Exactly.
And upon meeting the wagon train, I surmise you will put on a demonstration, whose purpose is to turn back the train.
Precisely.
Very well. But if you think the United States Army is going to escort a bunch of harebrained females across open desert, bent on throwing themselves under horse teams, you're gravely mistaken.
Very well. I thank you for your many courtesies thus far, but if you force us to go our way unescorted and any harm comes to us, three million infuriated women will turn the War Department upside down.
Mrs. Massingale, if I could force you to do anything, which obviously I cannot, it would be to go home, and stay home, where all decent women belong.
- Sergeant.
- Sir?
- Dammit.
- Yes, sir.
Sergeant, I want some scouts on the trail of those women tomorrow.
Have them keep in constant touch with us.
We'll move in a somewhat parallel direction.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir. Parallel direction...
Is that a new tactic, sir?
I'm not acquainted with it.
- It was well known throughout the war.
- Yes, sir, of course.
- What's it called, sir?
- Called?
What command shall I give the men?
"Move in a somewhat parallel direction"?
It's called... detached contact.
Detached contact?
And let it so be recorded in the daily journal!
Yes, sir.
No documents can establish just how the Sioux formulated their plans,
although it's known that a plan was so formulated.
All we can do is surmise what was said.
White man win war.
Now we use white man's way.
You, Chief Walks-Stooped-Over, with
20 braves attack front of wagon train,
and draw off guard.
You, Chief Elks-Runner, with 20 braves
attack rear of wagon train and draw off guard.
All other braves attack centre of wagon train.
When Long Knives chase braves,
then great Chief 5 Barrels and two brothers-in-law
circle around whole wagon train, come in from southeast,
grab last three wagons and go like hell... west.
In the morning, when the sun rises over Iron Mountain two hands high,
attack!
If Long Knives capture braves, show them paper.
We good Indians. No trouble.
Go back to reservation.
But before you go, don't forget to ask for presents.
In preparation for their attack, the Indians took up three positions.
Here...
here...
and here.
The Wallingham wagon train was moving in this direction,
escorted by the first cavalry patrol.
The temperance marchers,
having turned east, were moving in this direction.
The second cavalry patrol
under Colonel Gearhart was keeping detached contact.
The citizens' militia were now heading due north at this position.
Obviously, a collision course for all concerned.
The day began with a sandstorm of disturbing proportions.
- Hey, Rafe. Rafe! Rafe!
- What?
- Get 'em moved up back there!
- Huh?
Let's get them wagons moved up!
- Keep your eye on them Irishmen!
- What?
- Watch out for them agitators!
- Huh?
Oh, shut up!
Arise! Break away now.
They'll think we're lost in the storm.
They'll have to give in to our demands.
Keep together, everybody, and keep moving!
Don't despair. We'll get through.
Buell, take a scout. Make contact with the women. They may need help.
Sir. Phillips!
- Oracle, can you see anything?
- Nothing.
- I mean, in your mind.
- I need whiskey.
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
For our cause is just
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
To conquer sin and lust
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
Raise our banners high
Denver, we are coming
Denver will be dry, believers
Denver will be dry
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
For our cause is just
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
To conquer sin and lust
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
Raise our banners high
Denver, we are coming
Denver will be dry, believers
Denver will be dry
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
Raise our banners high
Rafe! Rafe! Rafe!
Denver will be dry, believers
Denver will be dry
Pretend we're lost!
We are lost!
Oracle, you sure you know where you're goin'
- I mean, you ain't lost?
- Course I ain't lost.
Now you just get behind me and keep goin'
Follow me, men.
Now listen to me, you men.
We're gonna shelter from this dust and...
Go!
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
No more whiskey here
Hey! Hey, wait...
Ladies, form a circle!
Rafe! Rafe! Rafe! Rafe!
- Rafe! Was that gunfire?
- Huh?
- I said did ya hear gunfire?
- What?
- Form a circle, dammit!
- Form a circle!
- A circle!
- Form a circle!
Form a circle!
Militia! Form a circle!
Whoa!
- Take cover, ladies!
Keep firin'
Henry!
Take a squad! Get up on that ridge!
- Yes, sir!
- Ho!
Protect your rear!
Fire!
Protect your other rear!
Fire!
Protect your rear!
Try this! Protect both rears simultaneously!
- It's Indians, sir!
- What?
Indians, sir! And they've got the women!
Good God! Charge!
A great effort has been made to adhere
to the chronological events of this action,
but due to the poor visibility we are only able to approximate positions.
As the battle neared its climax, we believe the wagon train was... here.
The two elements of the first cavalry detachment - here and here.
The second cavalry detachment - here.
The women's temperance marchers - here.
The Denver citizens' militia - approximately here.
The Indians - here, here and...
Agh!
...here.
It is not known what happened to the striking Irish.
To the best of our knowledge, these are the final positions
in the engagement that became known to history
as the Battle of Whiskey Hills,
but which, of course, was as nothing compared to the subsequent disaster
at Quicksand Bottoms.
Hallelujah, hallelu, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelu, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelu, Hallelujah Trail
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelu, Hallelujah Trail
- It's a miracle.
- I beg your pardon, sir?
A miracle of the highest order that so many bullets could miss so many people in so small an area in such a short space of time.
- No fatalities at all?
- None reported, sir.
- What do you propose that we do now?
- Our duty is crystal clear.
The first thing we must do is keep the peace.
- Do you agree, Buell?
- Absolutely, sir.
There are three important steps to peace negotiations.
No fraternisation and no discharge of firearms.
Yes, sir.
- And the third step, sir?
- The third step? It's not important.
What is important is to have a conference.
No peace without a conference, Slater.
Buell, inform all interested parties a conference will be held here
- in one hour from now.
- Yes, sir.
Beyond that, my contract - I got it here - says that I am going to deliver, and I am gonna deliver, come hell or high water.
You gotta get them damn foreigners outta here.
- Mr. Wallingham...
- I am a taxpayer and a good Republican, which means I am entitled to army escort.
I'm damn well gonna get army escort or I'm gonna raise hell...
- Mr. Wallingham.
- What?
I will not tolerate profanity in the presence of ladies.
Oh...
I think we understand your position by now.
The next party to be heard from will be... uh... uh... Who are you?
My name is Clayton Howell, sir, commander of the Denver Free Militia.
- What do you want?
- I'd like to inform the colonel that a lot of us here are members of the Denver Saloon Owners' Association, and we intend to receive that there cargo and take it home with us.
The winter nights are long and lonely in Denver, and a man is sorely in need of comfort.
Startin' next month, that there sun is gonna be a-settin' at 5.33pm, and she's gonna rise
11 dark hours later...
All right. I think we can leave the sun out of this.
- What are you doing here, Oracle?
- Colonel.
I'm the guide to the Denver Free Militia.
It is my duty to see that this precious cargo and these good people...
Thank you, Oracle.
I'm well aware of the duties of a guide.
- You're next.
- Kevin O'Flaherty at your service, sir.
President of the Irish Teamsters.
With your permission,
I have here a resolution containing 14 points, which I'd like to read prior to these labour negotiations.
Labour negotiations?
If our demands are not satisfied, your lordship, we intend to strike, as nasty as that may seem.
- By damn, you just try...
- Wallingham!
Oh.
I am not gonna abandon
10 of my wagons to them Indians.
Who said you had to? You've got the
Denver Free Militia to drive your wagons.
What?
Excuse me, sir.
The militia couldn't do it, unless we took a soldier to guard each wagon.
- They're the worst bar flies in Denver.
- And who's gonna guard the soldiers?
I see what you mean. Our supply of temperance men is extremely limited.
Yes, sir. It sure is.
Well, since you have nothing further to say, Mr. O'Flaherty, sit down.
- I call on Mrs. Massingale.
- Thank you very much, Colonel.
The temperance movement has now spread right across this great nation.
Founded in the year...
Mrs. Massingale, we are not here for a history of the movement.
- Have you anything further to say?
- I have.
Dump it, I say. Dump this entire vile cargo into the river right now.
- By damn, madam...
- Mr. Wallingham!
Did you get that, Captain?
Not a word, but I have an interpreter standing by. Sims!
Yes, sir.
Sims, find out what they're doing here, why they left the reservation.
Hunt buffalo. Minding own business.
Then white Long Knives come along and attack peaceful Indian.
Paper say peaceful Indian.
We go home, but first you give us presents.
- What'd he say?
- He said
"Hunt buffalo in peace, minding their own business,
- when white Long Knives attack."
- What?
Yes, sir. But they're willin' to go home now, sir.
Well, tell him he's made a wise decision.
Yes, sir.
Where are presents for us?
You give me 20 wagons whiskey
or I don't take my braves home.
Period.
Yes? What'd he say?
He said he would like to give you a present, sir.
- That's fine.
- But he hasn't got one, sir.
I see. Thank him, but tell him no present is necessary.
Wait... I'll tell him.
All right, then. Tomorrow morning, this whole, uh... this, uh...
We're leaving for Denver.
You will take your orders from
Sergeant Major Buell as to starting time, disposition of marching order, camp sites, et cetera.
Any decisions to be made will be made by me.
- Sergeant.
- Conference stands adjourned!
- Buell.
- Yes, sir?
What are those Indians doing here?
- I don't know, sir.
- How long have they been following us?
I was gonna bring that matter to the colonel's attention.
They've been trailing us all day, sir.
Shall I take a squad and run 'em off, sir?
Buell, the Indian wars are over.
These Sioux are wards of the government.
- How would that look in Washington?
- The colonel has a point, sir.
Get the interpreter. Find out why they're still here. And we'll camp early tonight.
- Field quarters assembly?
- Have the sentries out before dark.
Carter, check the rest of the sentries and find Sergeant Buell.
(water splashing)
Phillips, what's going on here?
Compliments of Mrs. Massingale, sir.
She has use of another tub, sir, and she thought the colonel looked dirty, sir.
Kind of scroungy and mucky, sir.
And she thought... she sort of...
Yes, sir.
- Colonel Gearhart, sir.
- Yes?
All sentries on their posts, sir.
The Denver militia has retired for the evening.
Where's Sergeant Buell?
At the Indian camp with the interpreter.
- That's all, Carter.
- Yes, sir.
- Sir?
- Come in, Buell.
The report from the interpreter, sir...
He, uh...
Well?
There might be a little confusion, sir.
- Confusion?
- Confusion. Yes, sir.
The interpreter was only sure they said
"Hunt buffalo in peace, minding own business, when white Long Knives attack."
"Willing to go home.
Would like to give you present."
Sergeant, get me Oracle Jones.
Yes, sir.
Friend.
Go ahead. Don't beat around the bush.
Find out why the hell they're still here.
He says he's waitin' for the presents.
Presents? Wait a...
Well, tell him we don't want any presents, and thank him.
Not for you, Colonel. For him.
Just a minute. He said "Hunt buffalo in peace, minding own business..."
- Sims!
- Yes, sir.
- You're under arrest.
- Yes, sir.
- Suppose I refuse to give them presents?
- They won't go home.
Well, find out what they want.
The chief says he wants 20 wagons of...
minne wakan... crazy water.
20 wagons of whiskey?
That chief... he's a real boozer, Colonel.
Well, you tell him no.
No one's gonna blackmail the United States Army!
Tell him to pack up his braves and get back where they come from. I'll tell him.
White chief... Indian chief... meet... as friends.
Leave as friends.
No crazy water, no whiskey.
Go home in peace... But go home!
- Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Hallelujah!
There! Now I see it!
Frank! Hold up there, Frank!
Frank, come sundown you head your wagons in towards Quicksand Bottoms.
- Why?
- We'll be campin' there tonight.
No, we ain't. Not this train.
Well, sure, Frank.
You just suit yourself.
That's a waste of time and horsepower.
I'll just light out for Denver on my lonesome.
Wait a minute, Oracle.
You seen somethin'
Well now, I don't mind tellin' you things is just beginnin' to come through.
- What? What?
- Can't say.
Got somethin' to do with Quicksand Bottoms?
Yep.
Rafe! Rafe! When we get to
Quicksand Bottoms, head in.
- We're gonna camp there tonight.
- Huh?
When we get to Quicksand Bottoms, head in. We're gonna camp there tonight.
OK, Frank.
Militia, halt!
Get that circle formed in there and keep it tight.
Stay away from the edge of that swamp. Look out!
Come on, move it up there.
Close it up tight!
Stay away from the edge of that swamp. Look out!
All right! All right!
Come on, the rest of ya! Watch out!
Frank! You'd better come quick!
The Irish have gone on strike and they've taken 10 of the wagons.
Clayton! Go and rescue that precious booze. Form up your men.
Militia!
Form up in a column of fours! Hup!
Sir, the teamsters have finally gone on strike.
They've taken 10 wagons and formed a circle.
- Where's Wallingham?
- He's gettin' the militia together, sir.
I've put a platoon between them and the ladies.
- The ladies?
- They're supporting the strike, sir.
It's quite possible that violence is imminent.
Come down from there, you alien radical!
- Capitalist!
- Anarchist!
Hold your positions, ladies.
You finally got here, did ya? I want you to get this damn mess straightened out.
You! Just what are you and your ladies up to this time?
Merely exercising our right to peaceful assembly, as guaranteed by the Constitution, which you, an army officer, are sworn to uphold.
O'Flaherty.
We're just honest workmen, your lordship, exercising our God-given right to refuse to work.
Hah! You're a pack of cowards, hidin' behind the skirts of these women.
Besides that, you're a pack of Irish thieves. They stole 10 of my wagons.
- I demand you do somethin' about it.
- Now, calm yourself, Mr. Wallingham.
I can see your wagons.
They don't look stolen to me.
Well, they're as good as stolen, by damn!
I must remind you, sir, there are ladies present.
Damn right they're present.
I want 'em removed.
I'm sorry, Mr. Wallingham, but this is obviously a labour dispute.
Much as I hate to admit it,
Mrs. Massingale and Mr. O'Flaherty are within their rights.
What about my rights as a taxpayer and a good Republican?
I'll protect your wagons and cargo, but under army regulations I cannot...
All right, men. Enough of this tin-soldier lawyer talk.
Club down them Irishmen.
Club 'em down and tote them women out.
Slater, take charge.
You'll meet force with force to whatever extent is necessary.
Companies A and B, move up! Ho!
Draw carbines! Ho!
Come on, get in there!
What are you waitin' for?
Uh... be reasonable, Frank.
We can't fight the United States Army.
It wouldn't look good.
All right, Gearhart. I'm holding you responsible for every one of my wagons.
- I accept the responsibility. Buell!
- Sir!
- We'll camp here tonight. Pick a site.
- Yes, sir. Field order 138, sir?
Yes, sir.
My congratulations, Mrs. Massingale. A brilliant manoeuvre, flawlessly executed.
Thank you, Colonel. I'm very flattered.
Maintain order, Slater.
Ladies.
Mrs. Massingale, ma'am...
Would you mind telling me just what you expect to gain by all this?
Time, for one thing.
But you can't keep my wagons immobilised for ever.
We'll see.
Would you mind telling me what your next move might be?
Well, apart from our non-violent picket line, we have no plans.
Except to have our meeting at the Indian camp tonight.
- A what?
- A rally.
A rally, Frank.
Hold your positions, ladies.
Come along, Louise.
A rally at the Indian camp.
We will save, we will save,
we will save another soul, hallelujah
We will save, we will save, we will save another soul
And if the road is rocky and a man should start to slip
Man should start to slip, man should start to slip
And if the road is rocky and a man should start to slip
We will take a better grip
And if a man gets weak and takes a bottle from the shelf
Bottle from the shelf, bottle from the shelf
And if a man gets weak and takes a bottle from the shelf
We will save him from himself
We will save...
We will save, we will save, we will save another soul
And if the road is rocky and a man should start to slip
Man should start to slip...
- What'd he say?
- He says, uh...
"Good to sign white squaw's paper.
Good for peace."
We will save, we will save, we will save another soul
And if the road is rocky and a man should start to slip
Man should start to slip, man should start to slip...
If it's the last thing I ever do,
I'll have that entire band transferred to Alaska.
- What are they doing now?
- Singing, sir.
- And signing pledges.
- I don't believe it.
As far as I can tell, they've got 50 signed already.
Go back there, Sergeant. Get me one of those pledges. I wanna see it.
How can I get one, sir?
Yes, sir!
We will save, we will save, we will save another soul
And if a man is saved, there are others still to come...
Can you handle the rest of this,
Louise?
You can count on me, Mrs. Massingale.
I'm gonna hand out equipment to Group B.
Good luck, Cora.
Here, sir. Just a crazy mark, but each one of 'em's marked different.
That woman! How many?
- 81 now, sir.
Get back there, Buell.
And tell Slater to cover his flanks.
Yes, sir.
Chisel.
Axe.
Hammer.
Where's that Massingale woman?
She's down there somewhere, Frank, takin' advantage of ignorant savages.
- There oughta be a law agin it.
- There oughta be somethin'
I don't trust her.
You just keep your pants hitched,
Frank.
Chief says..."No more peace."
What is it, Sergeant?
What happened, Sergeant?
- The Indians have captured the women.
- What?
One minute they were all signing pledges and then...
How did that idiot Slater ever let it happen?
On behalf of Captain Slater, sir, it's only fair to state that if the women hadn't started singing hymns and making all that... racket...
Sir, the Indians disarmed my men and took the ladies captive.
I know what they did, Slater.
They moved fast, we were outnumbered, there was nothing I could do.
- Sergeant.
- Sir!
Alert the bugler. Rouse the camp.
Prepare for battle.
Yes, sir! Sir, any rash move on our part may endanger the lives of the women.
- Dammit, I can't just twiddle my thumbs.
- No, sir!
Sir, the sergeant's right, sir.
An attack right now might be most ill-advised... sir.
- Why is he here?
- He's a symbol of their good faith.
Good faith?
- They wanna bargain with us.
- Bargain?
20 wagons of whiskey in exchange for the women.
- 20 wagons?
- Yes, sir. You see, the Indians...
- Can he understand us?
- Not a word, sir.
20 wagons comes out to about... three and seven-eighths women per wagon.
I think that was it, or maybe the interpreter was confused.
- Slater.
- Yes, sir.
There's only one course of action now.
I am declaring martial law!
I say you can't do it!
No tinhorn colonel's gonna come here and declare martial law.
If you don't shut up, Mr. Wallingham, my first step will be to lock you up.
Gentlemen, this bickering can lead to nothing constructive.
Since you cannot take military action against the Indians and you cannot negotiate with them, there is only one course of action open to us.
We must accede to their demands and give them the whiskey without delay.
Giving whiskey to Indians is strictly forbidden by the army regulations so dear to you, Mrs. Massingale.
Not if the Indians don't drink the whiskey.
What's to stop the Indians from drinking whiskey?
Precisely.
I have their pledges.
One hundred signed pledges with this one on the top signed by
Chief 5 Barrels himself. That's his mark.
She's right. That's his mark.
Do they get the whiskey?
It's my whiskey, and you're not going to touch one drop of it!
- Listen, Frank...
- Quiet!
In that case, I have no choice but to destroy all the whiskey right now.
You're bluffin'
Oh...
Am I?
There is a woman hidden in each and every one of those wagons, awaiting my order by code to start smashing the barrels of this vile cargo.
Madam, you lie.
Indeed?
Ladies of Group B...
Frank, will you keep your pants hitched?
The signal was to be a hymn, but that's not necessary.
Now, I'll just tell them to begin.
- You wouldn't do that.
- Ladies of Group B, you may begin!
Puncture those barrels!
- No, wait!
- Just a moment, ladies!
You let her smash one barrel and I'll have those brass buttons ripped off your chest!
- I'm a taxpayer and a good Republican!
- You say that one more time and I'll bust you right in the nose!
- Are you threatening me?
- Now sit down!
- You hear that?
- Sit down! Come on, Frank. Sit down.
And shut up!
Mrs. Massingale, sit down.
Sit down!
And stay down.
Ladies of Group B, get out of those wagons!
Right now!
- Sergeant, put this down.
- Yes, sir.
The United States Army confiscates
20 wagons of the Wallingham train.
There! You hear that?
Confiscation of private property, in which case I shall be repaid in full.
Go ahead, declare martial law.
- Martial law to take effect at daybreak.
- You declare it right now!
Don't you tell me when to declare martial law.
Slater. Take that symbol of good faith back to Chief 5 Barrels.
And, Slater, knock down the price.
- Buell.
- Sir!
This meeting stands adjourned.
Get outta here!
Go on! Get outta here, you bunch of vandals!
Get off of my property!
Get off of my bed! Get outta here!
Get outta that wagon! Get outta there!
Out! Out!
I thought I heard ya, Frank.
(chuckles)
He, he, he...
You got me into this, you soothsaying sot.
And now I'll get you out of it, Frank.
In fact, it's all set.
Everything's ready, except one more chore I gotta do right now.
Believe me, Frank, you just trust old Oracle.
Me and my Billy girl is gonna fix it all up.
Come on now, Billy girl.
Take me slow and take me true.
Colonel?
Go away!
Madam, I don't know what you're up to, but whatever it is
I don't wanna hear about it.
I've come to tell you how truly sorry
I am for what I've done.
Thank you, and good night.
Colonel, do you realise what will happen when word gets out that you've given
20 wagons of whiskey to Sioux Indians?
I realise!
20 wagons confiscated from a taxpayer and a good Republican.
Don't you tell me what he is or I'll bust you on the nose!
Colonel, those cords again.
Just let me...
Get away from my cords!
If you just relax and let the blood flow...
My blood can flow on its own.
Mrs. Massingale, I don't know what your plans are for tomorrow, but judging from experience, you'd better get some rest.
How can I rest after what I've done to you?
Try!
Oh...
My selfishness, my obstinacy, my stupidity in not listening to your advice.
I must agree with you.
It's all my fault you're in this position.
Well, crying isn't going to help.
Mrs. Massingale...
Mrs. Massingale!
You needn't look so shocked.
Plato, Augustus, Alexander... even George Washington took occasional spirits in medicinal amounts.
There's nothing wrong with limited libation under emotional stress.
Your entire career is ruined!
Well... I suppose there'll be some criticism.
Criticism? You'll be crucified!
The press, the public, the War Department.
Horace Greeley.
Oh...
Well, if I can save the lives of 27 women, I...
I'd gladly sacrifice my career.
After all, what is it?
Only 19 years of service.
With Grant at Vicksburg.
With Thomas at Nashville.
17 Indian campaigns,
Laramie to Fort Hall.
One more year.
281 dollars and 25 cents a month, pension.
Sergeant Buell,
27 dollars and 50 cents a month.
Every month.
19 years.
And all that time, not once have I ever... never have I ever met anyone like...
Like me?
Oh, well, I'll just resign gracefully.
Anyway, I'll resign.
Well, at least you'll still have your beloved West.
- I hate the West.
- Oh, dear!
Dust, wind, Indians.
My stubbornness, my obstinacy, my selfishness.
Now, now, Cora... uh... Mrs. Massingale.
If only I'd listened to you. If only!
Easy, easy, Mrs. Massingale... Cora.
Do you think you could ever forgive me, Thaddeus?
Well, I...
I could try.
Cora...
Couldn't we forget all this? I mean...
I mean... just forget the whole thing... Cora?
- Colonel Gearhart!
- One moment, Slater.
Come in, Slater.
- Captain Slater reporting, sir.
- Stand up, we'll march to Denver
- No more wine or beer
- Someone's singing. Go on, Slater.
Uh... Chief 5 Barrels said he'd take 15 barrels.
I came back with eight and he said 13.
I think that was the number.
The language barrier is very difficult, sir.
- Did you reach any agreement?
- 10 wagons of whiskey.
- 10 wagons?
- For all the women.
- Good work, Slater.
- Thank you, sir.
- What's he doing here?
- The same, sir. A symbol of good faith.
Are you sure he can't understand us?
- Not a word.
- That's all, Slater.
Oh... The Indians would like to have... uh...
Mrs. Massingale present for the exchange, sir.
- What for?
- Our symbol of good faith.
Tell Chief 5 Barrels I'd be happy to join my brave ladies.
Yes, ma'am. I'll make all the arrangements for the exchange. sir.
Good night, Slater.
It's scheduled for dawn.
Oh...
Thaddeus, isn't it wonderful? 10 wagons.
That's the exact number held by the Irish teamsters.
You're not gonna have to confiscate any of Mr. Wallingham's wagons after all.
Yes... well...
It's a long day tomorrow, Cora, and you need rest.
I'll take you back to your camp.
- Oh...
- Oh, I can get back by myself.
- You're sure?
- Oh, Thaddeus...
You're so kind and generous... and brave.
Good night, Thaddeus.
Stand up, we'll march to Denver
No more wine or beer...
We shall save
We shall save
We shall save another soul
- Hallelujah
- Frank.
- Huh?
- Frank, she's all fixed up.
What?
Frank, listen carefully.
This is important.
Frank! Hey, Frank!
You've been drinkin'
Frank, listen carefully. If you could get your wagon train outta here, if you could cross the river so as nobody, no Injuns, no women or army could follow, would you do it?
- How?
- Wait a minute!
You'd have to give up them 10 wagons on the exchange.
Now, here's what we do.
We take the rest of the wagons and we ride across Quicksand Bottoms.
None of them people could see us.
- Hold it.
- We'd get across the river...
Hold on! Just a damn minute now.
Nobody can cross Quicksand Bottoms cos they'd sink.
We can. There's a way, Frank.
I found it five years ago.
A bunch of scalp-hungry Injuns chased me right up to the edge.
I knew for sure they'd get me that night if I didn't get across.
I just pointed my Billy girl south and let her go. She didn't miss a step.
I did the same thing tonight.
She took me right across.
I've staked out a trail across the Bottoms with my red flannel.
We can't miss it.
We'll take all the wagons you got and go across, a-pullin' up the stakes as we go.
They won't even know what happened to us.
Once across the Bottoms, it's a straight shoot to Denver over flat, open country.
- We'll be free and clear.
- (Wallingham chuckles)
- Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
- Sh! Hush up!
Yeah... My sentiments exactly.
Hallelujah.
Here's one.
Here's another one.
Here... and here's one.
- But what are they?
- I don't know.
- But does it look familiar?
- It looks like Mr. Jones' underwear.
- It is.
- Are you... are you sure?
The ladies have confirmed it. He's not wearing those underdrawers now.
They're torn to shreds and spread out on stakes all across Quicksand Bottoms.
- Where's Group C?
Mrs. Massingale, have you any idea what these stakes are for?
I'm not sure, but I know what we're gonna do with them.
- What?
- Move them.
Stay between those red markers.
Don't be a-laggin' behind.
Keep your wagons up close, all of ya!
Militia, when we move out, get on the wagons.
That's the signal, sir.
All wagons ready for exchange.
Platoons A and B in position.
Get down there, Buell. Send Mrs.
Massingale over to the exchange point.
- Mrs. Massingale!
- Whoa, whoa!
- Mrs. Massingale, excuse me.
- I'm busy right now, Mr. O'Flaherty.
- It's about them 10 wagons.
- What's the matter with them?
- Nothing, mum, but they ain't whiskey.
- Ain't whiskey?
No, mum. Those wagons is filled with French champagne. All of 'em.
You know anything about
French champagne, mum?
Well, I sipped some once on my second honeymoon in Paris.
Aye, but it was most likely cold.
These bottles ain't, they're warm.
If you open a bottle of warm champagne, especially when it's been shooken up, well, it's...
- You mean they explode?
- Like a Marsh gun, about a .58 calibre.
We gotta handle those bottles like dynamite.
That's why they hired us Irish teamsters.
It's our business.
What's gonna happen when them savages get them wagons?
What's gonna happen to that champagne?
- Explosions?
- Right.
I just thought someone oughta know.
- Have you told Colonel Gearhart yet?
- Oh, no, mum. I've been afeard to.
What's holding you up, Mrs. Massingale?
I'm sorry, Sergeant Buell.
Excuse me, Mr. O'Flaherty.
Mrs. Massingale, we have a bit of a problem.
Chief 5 Barrels insists on taking the first wagon, and his two brothers-in-law the second and third wagons, and Elks-Runner the fourth wagon. That leaves nobody in charge on their side.
Me in charge.
You? You speak our tongue?
I speak with straight tongue.
Me in charge good. Drink later.
We'll agree to your taking charge on one condition, that I stay at the exchange point the whole time.
- Me there... whole time.
- Good.
One moment, please, Captain.
Mrs. Massingale, I'll never forgive myself for having failed you.
10 wagonloads of whiskey to the Indians.
- I've destroyed the crusade.
- Not quite yet.
- What?
- Give me a hatpin.
Hatpin?
Our goal is still in sight, Louise.
Courage, ladies!
First three ladies, front and centre.
There they go, sir.
Three women starting across...
- Sir... sir!
- What's the matter?
That Massingale woman.
She's heading for the exchange point.
- Why's that symbol of good faith there?
- I can't say, sir.
- Roll the first wagon.
- First wagon... roll!
What's he trying to do, bolting out of there like that?
- Roll wagon two.
- Wagon two... roll!
Ladies, move out!
Wagon two, roll!
Next three ladies, front and centre.
Tell 'em not to bolt like that.
Our teams'll get out of control.
Tell those Indians not to bolt like that.
- Roll wagon three.
- Wagon three, roll!
Roll!
Next three ladies, front and centre!
Well, move out. Go!
Don't let those idiots bolt that way.
Roll the wagons slowly!
No, not those wagons.
Hold those wagons back!
Hold on to those teams! There's gonna be a runaway! Hold 'em, I say!
Whoa! Somebody tell them Indians not to go bolting out there like that!
Wagon four, roll!
Next three ladies, front and centre!
Hold the wagons back!
Hold those teams back!
- Hold those wagons!
- Hold those wagons!
Don't bolt!
- Hold 'em back!
- Hold 'em back!
Carter! Cut those teams off and bring 'em back!
Ho!
Ho!
- Look out! Look out!
- We got a stampede!
Hold on to that team!
Don't let 'em follow them other horses!
No, not that way!
You're going the wrong way!
They're gonna stampede!
You'll never get 'em back!
Pull them up! Pull them up there!
Hey, you! Pull them up!
You're going the wrong way!
The whole Wallingham train!
Hey! Hey, you!
Turn 'em, turn 'em!
Head 'em back to the quicksands.
Uh... company, halt.
Whoa! Whoa!
Get 'em on through there!
Follow them red flags!
All right!
Follow them red flags as you go.
Stay right along in line with them.
Follow them little red flags there.
Follow them markers!
Stay right in line with them.
Follow them little red flags and...
Hey, you! No, not that way!
Frank! Look out, Frank!
Whoa! Whoa!
Rafe, Rafe! Come over here and give me a hand with this thing!
Help me up!
Get 'em outta here!
- OK, take 'em out!
- Take 'em outta here.
Go on, take 'em out!
Tell the colonel the Indians are firing on us!
Return fire!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
I beg your pardon!
What do you think you're doing to me?
My God! They've got Mrs. Massingale!
Sir! Sir, they're waving a flag of truce!
It's a woman's petticoat. Charge!
- Thaddeus!
- You!
We go home now.
- You speak my tongue?
- I speak with straight tongue.
We go home, hunt buffalo.
Peaceful Indian. Forget presents.
You hunt buffalo in peace.
You hunt deer of green forest in peace.
You go home in peace. But go home!
Oh...
Hey. Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Get 'em outta there.
Rafe! Rafe! Throw me that rope!
Yeah. Get a rope!
Hold what you got, Frank. I'm a-comin'
I'll help ya. Hold what you got, Frank!
I'll be right there with you.
Make it fast to that tree.
Get the slack outta that line.
Tighten up on it.
Now, hold on that. Hold it! Hold it!
Companies A and B of the cavalry escorted the ex-temperance marchers
back to their husbands and hungry children at Fort Russell.
It is to be assumed some time passed
before the Indians were able to regain their customary composure.
But it is known that the exploits of their journey became tribal legend,
to be told over and over again, from generation to generation,
with slight revisions.
The Denver Free Militia dissolved, never to march again.
And, of course, the strike of the Irish teamsters failed,
and the Wallingham Freighting Company went bankrupt,
having no visible assets.
You know, Frank, some Injuns told me once...
Reliable Injuns, Frank.
They said a Cheyenne brave and his pony sunk right here, and durned if they didn't ooze up again just as natural-lookin' and as pretty as you please.
Oh, they was dead, of course, but right near the top where you could grab easy.
It might be worth waitin' for, eh, Frank?
Frank?
There. You see?
So ended the great disaster at Quicksand Bottoms.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Massingale.
Cora Templeton Massingale retired from participation in temperance movements.
A military wedding was held at Fort Russell.
As it turned out, it was a double wedding.
A homestead claim was filed by Mr. Jones and Mr. Wallingham
on a piece of land encompassing the entire Quicksand Bottoms area.
Frank? Frank.
- Frank!
- What?
Frank!
Come on. Pull, Frank.
Careful, careful, careful.
Oracle... Oracle.
Oracle. Oracle!
Oracle. Oracle.
Hallelujah!
There! Now I see it!
- Glory, hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!
It's not to be denied
that there were occasional re-emergences of whiskey kegs,
which kept Mr. Jones and Mr. Wallingham, uh... uh...
quite content for a number of years.
And in spite of all predictions,
shaggy hair, and busy beavers to the contrary,
the winter of 1867 turned out to be the driest and warmest on record.
Such was the year, oh, pioneer West,
and the days of the Hallelujah Trail.
Don't know where we're goin' or where we been
Hallelujah Trail
It's written in the dust and blown by the wind
Hallelujah Trail
You can't tell a horse from a stubborn mule
Hallelujah Trail
You can't tell a hero from a doggone fool
Hallelujah Trail
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelu, Hallelujah Trail
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah
Early in the morning, almost day
Hallelujah Trail
Rise and shine, we're on our way
Hallelujah Trail
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelu, Hallelujah Trail
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu, Hallelujah Trail!
Shalako.
Shalako.
He rode wild country down new Mexico.
Borne on the wind to follow the sun.
Fought death with a knife.
Would gamble his life to own a woman.
Love came to shalako.
Shalako.
She called his name and wanted shalako.
Biding his time and planning to win.
He loved for a Clay, then traveled his way.
Ancl the lady followed him.
The one called shalako.
Shalako.

Shalako.
Excellent shot, countess, excellent. Bravo.
- How wonderful you were, Irina.
- Bravo, countess.
But how terrifying.
Wasn't she wonderful, Frederick?
- Remarkable.
- Thank you.
But I could hardly have missed at that distance.
It will be a magnificent trophy.
Of course we'll have the head.
You do look remarkably relieved,
Mr. ambassador.
Lam.
I was beginning to be afraid that my promises of game...
Would prove empty.
We can't have that, can we?
Good man, mako. We shall celebrate the first kill.
I must apologize for the temperature, baron...
But what can I do in this heat?
We'll survive, mako, even if the champagne is a little warm.
Give me a hand.
Not warm, baron.
Merely not sufficiently chilled.
We are not finished, are we?
I think, my dear, we ought to end the Clay...
On a successful note and make camp.
You'll find that everything has been prepared, baron. Elena!
- Senora...
- Rojas.
Elena.
Don't worry, Henry.
I've asked you before... if you must talk to the hired hands...
Please confine yourself to English.
Well, Henry, please...
It's vital that we make a good impression.
I would like to raise my glass to the countess.
Charming and beautiful...
Hits what she aims at...
Whoever he is.
How beautifully put,
Mr. ambassador.
Thank you, baron.
I don't think I've completely lost the touch.
How would you like some of that bubbly stuff, marker?
- That's not for me.
- Nor me.
If you were mine...
I'd make you lap that right out of the dust, lady daggett.
But I'm not yours, am I, Mr. fulton?
No, ma'am.
You're his...
And is he watching us.
I shouldn't let that trouble you.
It's quite the best he can do.
Frederick, look!
Scavengers. Coyotes, countess.
Probably following the blood smell.
Come on, Frederick.
Frederick, go with her!
My clear Julia, i didn't come 6,000 miles...
To hunt carrion-eaters.
But you can't let her ride off alone.
Any danger, Mr. fulton?
Not from coyotes. Pete!
Yeah?
Keep your eye on her.
Bring her back to the brenner ranch.
She's all yours, Pete.
Shoot 'em!
Shoot 'em!
Out of cartridges!
You all right?
Yes.
Brenner ranch.
Warn them...
Shalako.
Why don't you help him?
I'm... dead man.
- Did you separate?
- I had to.
It was just for a few minutes.
Never go alone here.
Not even for modesty's sake.
But our hunter, Mr. fulton, said there were no Indians here.
Fulton? Bosky fulton?
Yes.
This is a bigger mess than I thought.
All right. Come on, let's go.
What about him?
He's dead.
Won't you at least bury him?
Look, I let one of them go, and he'll be back...
And he's bringing lots with him.
Now come on.
How do you know?
Because their village is almost 100 miles from here.
They wouldn't come this far alone.
But why attack us?
We are just a hunting party.
They'll be doing the hunting.
He knew your name.
Who did?
Mr. Wells.
Is that who that was?
Are you the countess?
I am the countess.
Irina lazaar.
- They said there was one.
- Who said?
The army. They want you people out of here.
Why?
Because you don't belong here.
- What?
- Shut up.
Just relax. Act like a countess.
What does that mean?
Just don't faint. Come on.
Young braves cry revenge!
Woman die.
Shalako die.
They attacked first.
They killed the wagon-master.
You, woman kill three apaches.
It could have been four.
I let one go.
My father say waste time talk.
Tell him this.
I came alone and in peace.
Woman people brought guns...
Broke treaties...
Invadeland.
But I came alone.
And not with the army.
You kill me or the hunting party...
And the army will come in.
Many more of your people will die.
And how many this time?
My father say what you do?
I will have the hunting party on the move by sunup.
I will lead them directly off the reservation.
That is my promise.
Our promise.
My father say till sunup.
Your father is wise.
Shalako.
I wish you failure, shalako.
Chato, we've fought too much in the past.
Yes, we fight.
We both live.
My spirit live forever...
If I kill you before I die.
You are supposed to guess how many he ordered...
In the first place.
Baron, how many do you think he ordered?
Seventeen.
- Fourteen?
- No.
Well, I'll be damned.
Is anything wrong?
No, ma'am.
We see sights like this all the time here. Go.
Rather charming little wine, mako.
- My compliments.
- Thank you, baron.
How's your charming red-eye, bosky?
But we didn't come all this way just to drink a wine...
Available at any corner grog shop, did we?
Are you dissatisfied with our progress, sir Charles?
No. It's simply that I've yet to see...
The fabled big horn sheep.
There's plenty of them around, right, fulton?
Yeah. We'll find some in the morning.
Here they come!
Shalako!
Where's fulton?
Well, Irina,
I'm afraid we couldn't wait.
Frederick, Mr. Wells is dead.
Julia, Mrs. Clarke-please help the countess to her wagon.
Fulton! I never figured you for the stupe.
What are you doing bringing these people...
Into this territory?
Where's Pete Wells, shalako?
He's dead... and three Indians.
Ancl you oughta know better.
Apaches? - Yeah, chato.
Chato? Who's chato?
Fulton, give orders to strike camp.
Now, wait a minute.
Fulton does what we tell him.
What I tell him.
Ancl we have not been properly introduced, sir.
His name's shalako carlin.
Ex-army man.
You the baron?
Frederick hallstatt.
And this is my hunting party.
Well, baron, if you can get your hunting party...
Moving within the hour...
- And where would we be going?
- Off this reservation.
If the Indians are on the rampage...
It's up to the army to protect us.
You don't seem to understand, mister.
Senator. Senator Henry Clarke.
Then as a senator, you ought to be aware of the treaty.
The army's not allowed in here.
But we are an authorized hunting party.
You're a pack of whites breaking a treaty.
A treaty...
With savages?
Yeah, we've broken lots of them in the past.
But this one I helped make.
Now, the army has agreed to meet your party...
At the boundary of the reservation...
And conduct you to the safety of civilization.
Why don't you join us for dinner, sir?
Perhaps we can discuss means of dealing with your apaches.
Make...
Mrs. Clarke, how is the countess?
As well as can be expected, baron, after killing an Indian.
All by herself?
Did you really have to kill one of those savages, Irina?
What did it feel like?
It's not the same as killing a lion.
- But a red Indian.
- He was a man.
You're trembling.
The water is cold.
How beautiful.
Charles's mother had a necklace like this.
Before we were married, she used to say...
"My dear, when you and darling Charles are married..."
"I want you to have this."
I've never had the courage to ask...
Whether it went on a bad turn of the cards...
Or a poor choice of horses.
Wear it if you like.
Is it that unimportant to you?
Yes. I suppose nothing is important...
If it's yours by right.
Julia, they were going to kill me.
It was foolish of you to ride off alone.
None of it would have happened had you stayed with Frederick.
He was terribly annoyed.
That is hardly important.
It is the only important thing.
Frederick demands propriety.
If you want to please him...
Julia, it is one thing to try to arrange a marriage...
But another to insist on it.
So you see I'm quite certain,
Mr. carlin...
When you inflict sufficient casualties...
Your noble savage will be quite discouraged.
Baron, the apache is never discouraged.
He's born with an instinct for war.
He's never read any textbooks...
But there's nothing in saxe or jomini that he doesn't know.
You've read them?
Yeah.
Ancl compared to the guerrilla tactics of the apache...
They're a joke.
Irina, you look hardly the worse for your experience.
After dinner, you must tell us about it.
Frederick, when are we leaving?
Certainly not during dinner, my clear.
Mako, you may serve the ladies.
But didn't Mr. carlin explain?
Mr. carlin explained the dread details...
And I explained that with our far superior fire power...
There is really no problem.
But there is a problem.
Mr. carlin gave his word we would leave.
Ancl I gave mine, too.
I beg your pardon, countess.
I was not laughing at you...
Merely at the idea of feeling bound...
By a promise to the apaches.
I don't think Mr. carlin finds that as amusing as you do.
No, I don't. I guess you'd hate like hell to set a precedent.
I've no doubt, carlin...
That you could make your points without vulgarity.
Well, since I am a guest in your country, Mr. carlin...
Shall we do it your way?
Gentlemen, your votes.
Sir Charles?
Well, there's simply no question of running away...
In the face of threats from savages.
We learned by experience in India...
That to give way to these natives...
Could be a fatal mistake.
Senator?
Well, of course
I've never been a soldier...
But I'm quite a hand with a squirrel rifle.
I vote we teach them a lesson.
Mr. fulton?
Ain't run from no Indian yet, baron.
Mr. carlin?
That's a bad stone bruise, colonel.
You won't get far with him.
How many guns you got here?
There's buffalo, fulton, me...
Hockett, marker,
Andrews, Johnson.
Sixteen, not counting the foreigners.
- Rojas!
- Yes, colonel?
Get buffalo and a couple of others.
Fill every barrel and container that'll hold water.
Get all the food and ammunition you can find.
Bring 'em here.
Half up top and half down below here.
" Rojas!
" Yes, sir?
How long do you reckon you could hold out here?
I think two...
Or maybe three clays.
Yes, well, you better saddle me up a good horse.
In your condition, colonel?
Yeah, you're right.
A couple of hours sleep now will make it easier later.
But remember...
No more than two hours.
Sure, colonel.
When will they come?
The first light of dawn.
Mr. carlin, earlier today you were angry...
That I separated from Mr. Wells.
Yeah. Well, that was a whole other situation, countess.
Right now, ahead of me
I've got two hours sleep...
And a hard day's ride to the border...
To convince the army that it's worthwhile coming in here.
In all, it should take two to three days.
With a bit of luck, you should all still be alive.
You need a good horse.
Take mahomett.
Your Arabian?
Yes. I want him safe.
You'll have to talk your friends into sleeping up top.
It's the only place that can be defended...
For a while, that is.
Unless the baron wants to form a square out front.
You don't like us very much, do you?
No. You're trouble.
Stone dumb useless trouble.
But you...
Well, you're too beautiful to die.
Would you suggest I abandon my friends and go with you?
You could do a lot worse...
But I suppose a lady has to live by a code.
If she lives.
Either of you two gentlemen ever heard of Hannibal...
Hamelin of Maine?
No.
Henry, I'm sure the gentlemen...
Are not interested in American politics.
Well, they're politicians, ain't they?
Trouble with being on safari, baron...
No place to chase the ladies...
When comes time for Brandy and cigars.
Now about Hamilton...
Hannibal hamelin of Maine.
Absolutely no reason under the sun...
Why you should ever have heard of him...
But he was Lincoln's vice president...
During the war years.
The party dropped him for Johnson in '64...
And you know what happened to Johnson.
Well, now at the time of that convention in '60...
I was still a senator.
Elena and I had just gotten married.
Would you believe it, baron, at that convention in '60...
There was a very strong move toward me...
For the second position.
Pardon.
What the hell is happening here?
Where's Irina?
Don't you realize the whole plan is going up in bloody smoke?
And what would you suggest i do about it?
Find Irina.
Do whatever you have to to get her back with the baron.
This was your idea from the start.
You said if I arrange the trip, you would make the match.
Well, I got the baron to come here...
And I arranged for that bloody idiot Clarke!
Charles, they'll hear you.
Let them hear me.
Don't you realize that we haven't enough funds...
To get back to england?
Ancl even if we did...
We'd probably be arrested for debt.
You can be arrested for debt, my love.
You are my wife.
Or do you intend to settle down with that cowboy?
Don't be a fool.
I'm not quite the fool you think I am.
But I'm surprised at you this time, Julia.
It's the first time you've really dropped down in class.
How you've misread me all these years, Charles.
I've always taken what was available.
Hit me, and it will all be ruined.
Perhaps I'll leave you to the apaches.
They apparently have very interesting ways...
With ladies.
I'd have served the cause a little better...
Than Hannibal hamelin of Maine.
And father Abe would not have had to look elsewhere...
For a new vice president.
So there I'd have been in '65 when tragedy struck.
Imagine that.
Of course...
I wasn't even re-elected to the senate in '60.
- Henry, I wish...
- It's all right, my love.
You know that I have never blamed you.
If you'll excuse me, i must get ready for bed.
Just one moment!
Baron, stop them!
Colonel carlin gave us orders, baron.
Colonel carlin?
Carlin!
- Carlin!
- Here!
Are you giving orders in my camp, carlin?
No, Frederick.
I asked him to help.
If the Indians attack tomorrow...
We must get supplies into the stable.
We are to hunt wild sheep tomorrow.
Baron...
I figured you for stubborn, but you're something else.
You, sir, are one stupid son of a bitch.
If you had any breeding,
I'd kill you.
However, my clear, since you seem truly worried...
I see no harm in taking a few simple precautions.
I suggest collecting water in all possible containers.
Mr. fulton, you'll set the watch.
Hans, you'll select the weapons.
See that everyone is supplied with cartridges.
Yes, baron.
I apologize for carlin.
You aren't frightened,
Irina, are you?
- Angry?
- No.
I understand you, Frederick.
I know you would rather die than show weakness.
Naturally. And so would you.
We are two of a kind.
I do believe, Irina, we should be married.
Frederick, this is not the time...
I'm aware that this is not the proper time...
But it would be a very sensible match.
Sensible... yes.
But do you love me, Frederick?
Would that be important, Irina?
It's more important now to save our lives.
My clear, if we had only you and these rifles...
I would believe our lives would be completely secure.
Sleep well.
No'.!
We'll meet again, Mr. carlin.
Don't you count on it, baron.
Marker...
Luther.
Buffalo, rojas...
Upstairs with me.
Get down, ma'am!
Hans, stop them!
You gotta lead 'em, ma'am, like a flying duck.
- Help him.
- Yes, ma'am.
Rojas! Downstairs!
Stay up here.
To hell with you.
We're gonna help the baron.
- We're all gonna be killed!
- Keep quiet.
Come on, baron, we'll cover you!
There are still some of our men out in the wagon.
Get the hell out of that wagon!
Why don't they attack?
Why should they?
We're not going anywhere.
I'll go downstairs, see who's still alive.
Lady daggett, please, we need help.
You must hold his legs.
No.
Lady daggett, do as he asks.
Do you want to get killed?
We're all going to die.
Idiot, idiot. Do you know what they'll do to you?
I don't care!
Fulton!
They're coming over the wall!
Get upstairs.
Cow ards.
Hold it.
They're pulling out.
Look!
That's what's making them pull out.
Damn fools are burning up every bullet they've got.
Hold your fire!
Can't you see they're pulling out?
Hockett, Luther.
Get the coach horses ready.
Clean out that wagon, then burn it.
Right.
Johnson, saddle the horses.
We've driven them off.
Driven them off, my butt.
It's that smoke talk.
Maybe now we can leave for the fort, Frederick.
There would seem to be little choice.
Rojas, Harris, marker...
Collect the remaining horses...
And hitch them to the wagon and coach.
Mako, you'd better start carrying supplies down.
And tell fulton to come up and see me.
Hold it!
What the hell do you think you're doing, fulton?
Marker, take their guns.
In there.
What about shalako's horse?
No good.
You can forget about him.
Senator.
There's really no need for you to carry anything.
I'm quite sure there isn't, baron...
But right now it seems like the smart thing to do.
Put that stuff right in the coach, gentlemen.
The baron wants you upstairs, fulton.
Yeah.
Put that stuff in the coach, mister.
Luther, keep your eye on them.
Fulton, where are you?
I'm busy.
I want to take hans' body down.
Fulton, you come up now.
No, baron.
You come down here now.
Shoot him, Irina.
Move with that, and he gets it right in the gut!
Shoot him!
Throw it down here.
Now bring the others down.
Marker, keep your eye on 'em coming down...
And take these two guys up and get the supplies.
Put it in the coach.
Shuck 'em down for whatever's left.
Right, boss.
Johnson, help marker.
Check their rifles.
Make sure they're empty.
Are you going to leave us here to die, fulton?
We're going to leave you.
Whether you live or die is up to the apaches.
Give me your rings.
Yours, too, baron.
My family ring... no!
Ok.
All their rifles are empty.
We've got the ammunition.
That's it, then.
Johnson, you drive the coach.
Luther, ride shotgun.
Hockett, you and me'll ride the horses.
Marker, inside the coach.
We got most of the food, fulton...
But what about the rest of that water?
I'm going with you!
Julia!
In the coach.
For god's sake!
If any of you ever get down to Mexico, look me up.
Let's get the guns loaded.
And dig out the food.
- Load the guns? With what?
- What food?
- Shalako had us hide a reserve.
- Under the hay.
I'm sorry, baron.
That's all the water.
The well.
Baron, someone's coming!
It's shalako!
The apaches pulled out just when they had us dead, shalako.
- There was smoke!
- Yeah, my smoke.
- Then fulton high-dealed!
- Who went with him?
Luther, marker, hockett, and Johnson.
- Where are the rest of them?
- Dead.
Lady daggett went with fulton.
He took all the horses except yours.
- How is he?
- Better, but...
Load up the horses.
We'll leave now.
You'll be walking, so travel light.
Do we have a chance?
You'll be on foot, so it depends.
Now, everybody keep in the coach tracks.
If the fort lies in that direction...
It seems suicidal that we go that way.
That's what I'm hoping chato will think...
And he'll lose a couple of hours trying to head us off.
That should give us time to reach the plateau.
There's water up there...
And with the high ground we can hold them off.
For a while, that is.
He's right, Frederick.
Shalako.
Buff, rojas, come out here.
Keep on the rocks.
Get behind the big rock.
Inside.
That'll have to do.
Come on.
Stay down.
God damn you!
There were only six of them.
What about those?
Freeze! Don't move.
We have a couple of hours until dark.
Let's use them.
Move quietly.
All right?
My watch?
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.
Sit down.
I am so thirsty.
Press it to your lips.
Does it contain water?
Well, something like it.
You know a lot about everything, don't you?
Enough to survive.
Shalako... it's a strange name.
Yeah. It means "rain bringer."
Zuni Indian.
It seems every time I went to that territory, it rained.
They could be in for a long dry spell.
Ancl what is your real name?
Moses zebulan carlin.
My mother was partial to reading the Bible.
That's just why i stuck to shalako.
Ancl where is
Mrs. Moses zebulan carlin?
- You know I'm not married.
- How would I know?
Most women have an instinct for that sort of thing.
Same way as most men have an instinct...
For a woman who's available.
I knew a general's wife in Washington...
Who could walk into a room...
And pick out every bachelor at a glance.
How could she tell?
Well, she said it was their angle of arrogance.
That would apply to Frederick.
Yes, he is arrogant.
What sort of wife do you think he'll marry?
Someone of his own class...
Who would give him strong soldier sons.
And you? Will you ever marry?
You can live without a woman?
Only when I have to.
Out here, a man just finds a squaw...
Washes her down good a couple of times...
- I don't want to know.
- You did ask.
I still don't want to know.
Of course...
When there's a choice...
No.
I would like very much for you to make love to me...
But it's impossible.
No.
Out here, nothing's impossible.
No.
Why? Frederick?
You don't understand.
It's not for him. It's for me.
That would spoil everything...
Make it ugly...
And I couldn't bear that.
What if I just took what I wanted?
I would kill you.
Well, at least I'd die happy.
Well, at least I'd die happy.
If there were no hope, there would be no problem.
But you have given us hope.
Would it help my case any if I told you there was none?
You'd be lying, wouldn't you?
Unfortunately, yes, but not by much.
I think you'd better go back and try to go to sleep.
Sometimes I wish i could be more like Julia.
She takes what she wants.
Come on, bosky, the sun's up.
Let's go.
We'll take a rest here.
That's the plateau.
We're almost there.
Not quite.
That's the back of it.
We've got to follow the canyon round.
Takes seven or eight hours to do that.
Ancl not a drop to drink...
Water, I mean.
There's plenty up there.
Why don't we climb here?
Not a chance.
Not unless you're a mountain goat.
It would be a comparatively simple climb.
Now, look, baron...
I'm not trying to give you an argument, colonel carlin.
I'm merely stating facts.
I might know nothing about
Indians and frontier tactics...
But I do know about mountain climbing.
You see, it's a dilettante's sport.
Frederick has climbed the south face of the jungfrau.
As sir Charles would say,
"easy as pie."
We have got the ropes.
These should be long enough.
It's a mere 300 meters.
Well, how long would it take?
Depending on the slowest member.
You would not have to wait for me.
I've climbed since i was a child.
I reckon he must mean me, ma'am.
I don't like to climb no higher than my horse's back.
How long?
A couple of hours...
Maybe a little longer with the supplies.
Ancl the Indians would have to go through the canyon.
They'd never climb.
And we'd save five or six hours, shalako.
Why are we waiting?
Ok. Unload the supplies and cut the horses loose.
All right.
I'll lead. Sir Charles...
You'll take the last position as anchor man.
The men will carry supplies.
The ladies, I'm afraid...
Does that make sense to you, carlin?
This is your party, baron.
All right, then we go.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
Well, there ain't nothing up there.
I don't see nothing.
I'm going to ride on ahead.
Do you want to come with me?
No, I'm fine.
I may join you later.
Carlin.
All right, now.
Watch it.
All right?
Yeah.
Come on, buff.
- Hold me!
- Hold on!
Hold me, shalako!
Don't look down.
Keep your head up.
Hold me, shalako.
Ok.
Easy, now.
I hope that was food.
No, damn it to hell, it was bullets!
Indians! Apaches!
They've caught up with the coach.
Forget them. Come on up.
No'.!
No! Please! Please!
Please!
Take this.
No! No!
Carlin? Come on now.
All right, buffalo, up you come.
Do this for pleasure, eh?
As often as possible.
All right.
Don't take too much at once.
Careful.
Easy as pie.
Yeah, sure.
Hate to think of all those cartridges we lost.
I ain't goin' back.
We have our weapons, we have food.
And water.
Yeah, and plenty of time.
Carlin, look.
How much time?
They can't get up the canyon until nightfall.
And Indians don't attack at night.
You're learning fast, baron, but you can never be certain.
- We'll post sentries anyway.
- Of course.
When you've quite finished...
All right, daggett, come on.
Heavens, I'm thirsty.
Don't know who's going to last longer, them or me.
Dinner is served, gentlemen.
I hope the wine's chilled properly.
They have to come across this open space.
Yes. They should come this way, but you never can tell.
With the others in these forward positions...
We'll set up a crossfire...
And get daggett to cover the rear.
Dinner, sir Charles.
No. Thank you very much.
Perhaps she got away.
She never really cared for me...
But I, in my own way...
I loved her very much.
Well, my love, shall we retire?
Of course. I believe we have the royal suite.
No, I have the royal suite.
You have the presidential suite.
Good night, senator.
Si, senora.
Buenos noches.
I'm sorry, Henry.
I know you don't like me to speak Spanish...
But somehow it's comforting.
Buenos noches, senor.
Hasta manana.
It is a beautiful language.
Perhaps you'll teach me someday.
Henry, whatever happens tomorrow...
We have shared so many good things, haven't we?
Thank you, Elena.
I'd better check with buff.
It's my watch. Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night, shalako.
Strange name, isn't it?
Does it mean anything?
Some other time, baron.
Look, Frederick...
Like two lovers on a stroll.
You're a romantic, Irina...
Something I never suspected in you.
I'm not sure i suspected it myself.
Well, I had better take up my post.
Irina...
Even if, I mean...
If we were to return to Europe...
I would ask you to please forget my proposal of marriage.
Frederick, that's...
No no, my darling.
It would never work.
You'd spend the rest of your days hating me...
For being so stupidly stubborn.
How could I hate you for doing what you think right?
You are very generous.
Perhaps I should say...
I'd never stop hating myself.
Buff.
Yeah, shalako.
Come on in.
- All right?
- Yeah.
They're down there, all right, but they're a long way off.
What do you reckon they're doin' down there, shalako?
Wondering what we're doing up here.
Sure is a lot of them.
Take over.
How many times did you say?
What?
Wash her down a couple of times.
Isn't that what you said?
Yes.
Well...
Last night, you wanted me.
Do you want me now?
Yes.
Here they come, shalako!
Shalako.
It's fulton. I'm coming in.
Keep in your positions, all of you.
Ok, fulton, come in.
Why'd you come up here?
I had a choice...
Cross the desert on foot without water...
Come up here with you...
Or the Indians.
I thought you'd be glad to see another gun.
How'd you know we were up here?
How'd you know we were up here?
I ran into the Indians.
It figured.
Fulton!
Where's Julia?
They're dead... all dead.
You murdering bastard!
Daggett, you get back to your post.
Fulton, I want you right there.
Where I get killed first?
That's right, and where I can watch you.
Mako, give him some cartridges.
Shalako!
Hold your fire.
They're pulling back.
Shalako, they're pulling back...
And the fight hasn't even started yet.
I don't like it.
I'll go down and take a look.
Give me some cover.
Did you see me, countess?
I got three.
- Good man, mako.
- Yes, I think so.
Sir Charles, I got...
Sir Charles!
Fulton!
Elena, Irina, get some water, please.
At last...
I've managed to get something right.
- What the hell happened?
- They're both dead.
Mako, take daggett's position.
Rojas, pull back.
How?
Nobody shoot.
Shalako, we fight.
No'.!
I'll be happy when I die, shalako.
Shalako!
No kill chato.
No more blood shed.
- You go.
- Kill me, shalako!
You have killed me.
Colonel, they left us horses.
Yeah.
Rojas, prepare to bury the dead.
Shalako.
Shalako.
He rode wild country down new Mexico.
Borne on the wind to follow the sun.
Fought death with a knife.
Would gamble his life to hold a woman.
Love came to shalako.
Shalako.
She called his name and wanted shalako.
Biding his time and planning to win.
He loved for a Clay, then traveled his way.
Ancl the lady followed him.
The one called shalako.
Shalako.
Shalako
Love in the country
Where skies are blue
All you'll be dreaming of
Are the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees
Till you're up to your knees in love
There's a treehouse in the meadow
Below the mountain peak
The perfect place for lovers
When they play hide and seek
There's a covered bridge at Crippled Creek
Where the horses always stop
'Tween the treehouse
And the covered bridge
That's how Mom won Pop
By making love in the country
Where skies are blue
All you'll be dreaming of
Are the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees
Till you're up to your knees in love
There are roses on the trellis
And the scent of new-mown hay
The clingin' vine is jealous
On the fence across the way
There's a great big yellow moon above
And a breeze to sing a song
'Tween the roses and the yellow moon
A fella can't go wrong
When he makes
Love in the country
Where skies are blue
All you'll be dreamin' of
Are the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees
Till you're up to your knees in love
MAN: Lord to goodness.
Not again.
MAN: Howdy, Drago.
DRAGO: Morning, Curly.
Makes seven times this month he come home swaggled.
DRAGO: Six.
CURLY: Seven.
Six. Once was his birthday.
That don't count.
Give me my buggy whip.
Didn't have anything for breakfast... but two raw eggs and a mug of honey.
CURLY: No!
MAN: Curly!
CURLY: Yes, Boss?
Don't say it's a fine morning, or l'll shoot you.
Get out of here, Bunyan.
Good morning.
CHlLDREN: Good morning.
Carlos, what are you doing up there? l hope l get it this time, Mr. McLintock.
My brothers... they got the big hats already.
All right. Let 'em have at it.
Get over.
DRAGO: Did you want to let me drive?
You promised me you would sometime.
No! Ya!
DRAGO: Boss, you better watch that turn on the road!
You're gonna kill both of us one of these days.
Thank you, Mr. Boss!
You got cattle in the bank, Boss.
Ya!
Giddyap. Ya!
Keep 'em going.
15 cents a pound all the way to Kansas City.
Ya! Ya!
Now, Boss, there's one old pensioner... l wish you'd pass up.
- Bunny?
- Yeah.
BOSS: Wish l knew where l'd seen his face before.
DRAGO: He ain't an old timer.
He's just been around town a couple of years.
BOSS: Aw, you have no milk of human kindness.
Morning, Mr. McLintock.
Morning, Bunny.
Well, l can see you're in good health.
Never felt better... contrary to what you may hear.
My kidneys ain't what they used to be, and my liver's been leaving me bilious.
Drago.
DRAGO: Eh.
Hello, Ben.
Hey, McLintock.
Drago, throw that in the buggy.
DRAGO: Yes, sir.
BEN: That's a scrubby bunch of sooners, huh?
McLlNTOCK: They are at that.
MAN: That ought to make Douglas happy... lining his pockets with land fees.
BEN: What are we going to do? l don't know what you're gonna do, Ben.
Me... l do nothing.
200 families. Quarter of beef a week per family. lf they last two years, that can be a sizable number. l got 20 head to one of any other brand on the Mesa Verde. l'm not hollering.
Some of us haven't got all the money in the world.
Some of us ain't old and tired and feel like being put upon.
You interest me, Young Ben.
Go on.
The first time l find one of our hides wearing our brand... hung on one of them settler's fences, l aim to kill me a plow boy.
You do what you want,
McLintock.
We'll do what we want.
Fellas my age generally call me G.W. or McLintock.
Youngsters call me
Mr. McLintock.
All right, Mr. McLintock, not because l'm afraid of you.
You're the big yeast out of this country, and l reckon a fella my age should call you mister.
He's full grown now, G.W.
He's a half-owner of the spread. l made him a full partner... the day the doc gave me the long face.
Well, you want him to vote... the first time this territory becomes a state, don't you?
Of course, l do.
These settlers get burned out, there'll be a lot of hollering... that this country's too wild to be a state, and we'll go on being a territory some more, with a lot of political appointees running it... according to what they learned in some college... where they think that cows are something you milk, lndians are something in front of a cigar store. l'm looking to you to hold Young Ben down.
BEN: l'll do what l can.
G. W: Come on over to the house once in a while.
We'll rack up a few hands of stud.
BEN:
G.W., that'll be just fine.
MAN: lt's a nice morning, ain't it, Boss?
G. W: Everybody's entitled to their own opinion.
MAN: Like that again, eh?
Here's something that'll cheer you up.
About 1,000 head. l figure they'll bring about 1,250.
G. W: They're not as fat as l'd like to ship.
They all off the north range?
MAN: Yes, sir.
Settlers.
Every one of them with a plow and a Bible, not the slightest idea of what the range is for.
Drago!
Drag out that hog-legg.
DRAGO: Yes, sir.
G. W: Get me some attention.
Hee ya!
People, people, people!
People!
DRAGO: Come on, all of you!
Gather around.
People, come on! Gather around. l'm McLintock.
You people planned a homestead and farmed the Mesa Verde.
MAN: Yes, sir.
The government give us each 160 acres.
The government never gave anybody anything.
Some years back, a lot like you came in.
They had a pretty good first year... good summer, easy winter, but the next year, the last rain was in February, and by June, even the jackrabbits had sense enough to get off the Mesa.
Folks, do you know who that is?
That's McLintock...
George Washington McLintock. l told them that, Douglas.
DOUGLAS: He controls the water rights... on 200 square miles of range.
You know that lumber you got?
That came from his land.
Cut by his loggers and milled in his mills.
Douglas, l come close to killing you a couple of times... when we were younger.
Saddens me l didn't.
DOUGLAS: Can you imagine a man who owns all that...
Oh, and mines, too. l forgot to mention them...
All that, and he's begrudging poor people a measly... a measly 160 acres.
That right, Mr. McLintock?
You begrudge us a little free land?
There's no such thing as free land. lf you make these homesteads go, you'll have earned every acre of it, but you just can't make 'em go on the Mesa Verde.
God made that country for buffalo. lt serves pretty well for cattle, but it hates the plow, and even the government should know... that you can't farm 6,000 feet above sea level.
Any trouble, Mr. McLintock?
No trouble, Sheriff.
How about you, Douglas?
Douglas?
Just plain Douglas, eh?
And you call him Mr. McLintock.
Why?
Well, Douglas, l guess it's because he earned it.
Mr. McLintock?
Yeah? l'm a good hand with cattle,
Mr. McLintock. l'd like a job.
Well, you look strong enough.
You come in with those sooners?
Well, yes, sir, but we don't have a homestead.
G. W: Can't use you.
Tough life, ain't it, sonny?
Well, ain't much future in being a farmer around these parts.
Ladies, this is the finest chantilly lace... available anywhere.
Chantilly, Mr. Birnbaum.
Well, believe me, it's the best.
Oh, excuse me.
Please, look around.
Take your time.
Drago, l got
1,000 Havana cigars... and 12 of those hats for you over there.
Them big hats ain't going to last long the way some folks... have been dipping into that redeye these days.
Uh-oh.
Good morning, G.W.
Good morning. l stole some stick candy.
Please. Help yourself.
Come on in.
Davey! You can forget about saddling up the horse!
Come in here!
Problem?
Yes.
Well, if l were blacks, l'd move queen's bishop to king 4.
Yeah. You might be right.
You know, l was just starting to work this out... when the letter came.
Letter? lt was...
MAN: What happened?
Don't you want...
- Morning, Mr. McLintock.
- Morning, Davey.
DAVEY: You being here saved me a trip.
Oh, that hat and suit of clothes you picked out for my birthday... well, instead of this cowboy hat, l'd like to have this one... if it's, uh, all right with you, sir.
G. W: Well, it's all right with me, Davey.
Of course, that looks like the kind of a hat... a fella'd wear down Main Street to start a fight.
DAVEY: Oh, l don't need a city hat for that.
All l have to do is walk down the street, and some wiseacre will call me an lndian, and, just like that, the fight's on.
BlRNBAUM: Davey, the letter. lt's for you.
And you are an lndian.
DAVEY:
Yes, l know l'm an lndian, but l'm also the fastest runner in town. l've got a college education, and l'm the railroad telegrapher, but does anybody say, "Hello, college man" or "Hello, runner" or "Hello, telegrapher"? No!
Not even "Hello, knothead..."
BlRNBAUM: Davey.
DAVEY: lt's always,
"Let the lndian do it."
BlRNBAUM: Will you go out in the store and help the ladies?
DAVEY: All right. l'm also a bookkeeper, part-time clerk.
Always, "Let the lndian do it."
Always, "Let the lndian do it."
BlRNBAUM: A lady brought that out here this morning, asked for it to be taken out to the home ranch for you.
Handsome lady.
Kind of tall with red hair.
Called me Mr. Birnbaum, just as if she'd never seen me before... and as if that veil that covered her face... could keep me from recognizing her. l thought she was in New York or Europe or someplace.
G. W: So did l.
DRAGO: Jake, you better throw on a couple extra cases... of the boss' favorite bourbon.
That stuff sure gets used up fast out at our place.
G. W: Which reminds me, you better start tapering off.
DRAGO: Huh!
Katherine's in town.
Katie?!
Ladies.
Good morning.
MEN: Morning, Mr. McLintock.
Morning, Mr. McLintock.
G. W: Morning, gentlemen.
Good morning.
WOMEN: Morning.
G. W: Fauntleroy.
Morning, G.W.
What are you doing in here?
Why aren't you out at the desk?
Helping out the bartender.
Yeah, l see.
A busy day.
Give me the key to room 17.
What?
17, and don't advertise it.
Here they come,
Mr. McLintock.
G. W: Set 'em up.
- Beer.
- Whiskey.
Day off?
Off day.
Wonder what he's so preoccupied about.
Haven't you heard?
No. What?
Katie's back in town.
Katie?
Yes, dear.
The social arbiter.
Well, hi, sonny.
Good morning. Oh!
WOMAN: He sure is a quiet one.
Mr. McLintock, l don't want to bother you... l'm sorry, boy. l told you, no job.
Katherine.
George Washington McLintock. l thought you'd want this.
G. W:
First dig of the spur, but who am l to upset your plans?
Don't you feel kind of silly?
KATHERlNE: l never feel silly.
G. W: lt's because you have no sense of humor.
Why couldn't we sit down in the hotel dining room... and talk about whatever it is you want to talk about?
Or why couldn't you just come over to the house?
And have everybody know that we're meeting?
Everybody knows, and what's the difference? We're married.
That is something l should like to change.
You know the answer, Katie.
That isn't why you sent for me.
Let's get to the rat killing.
That's just the kind of remark... that's always endeared you to me.
Let us open the discussion.
Very well. Our daughter is coming home in a few days, or, rather, she's coming here. lt was just a slip of the tongue... that made me refer to this ugly hamlet as home.
"Our daughter." ls it so hard to say her name? lt's Becky.
Rebecca! l hate that name.
Anyway, she's coming home, and l hoped to persuade you to let her live with me... part of the time in the capital, part of the time in New York, and, of course,
Newport during the season.
You're whistling in the wind, Katie. lf she stays here, she'll become just as crude and as vulgar... as all of this country.
And if she goes your way, she'll be all show and no stay.
Oh.
No go, Kate.
KATE: l hate you.
Oh, how l hate you!
G. W: Half the people in the world are women.
Why does it have to be you that stirs me?
You animal.
G. W: That's the story. l saw your picture in the paper at the Governor's Ball.
You were dancing with the governor.
KATE:
At least he's a gentleman.
G. W: l doubt that.
You have to be a man first before you're a gentleman.
He misses on both counts.
Hey, sonny, you gonna ask him again?
Nope.
Hey, boy, you got to pocket your pride.
You got to beg.
You better listen to an expert, sonny. l'm telling you. You got to grovel. Human nature.
Gets 'em every time.
Mister, leave me alone.
Everybody does it one way or another.
Heh heh heh!
About that job,
Mr. McLintock. l already told you, son, l've got no need for farmers... or use for 'em.
Just one minute,
Mr. McLintock.
My father died last month.
That's how come we lost our homestead. l've got a mother and a little sister to feed. l need that job badly.
What's your name?
Devlin Warren.
Well, you got a job, son.
See my home ranch foreman.
He's over at the corral.
Step down off of that carriage, mister.
Hold that hog-legg.
G. W: l've been punched many a time in my life, but never for hiring anybody.
DEVLlN:
Aw, l don't know what to say. l never begged before. lt turned my stomach. l suppose l should have been grateful you gave me the job.
G. W: Gave?
Boy, you got it all wrong. l don't give jobs. l hire men.
You intend to give this man a full day's work, don't you, boy?
DEVLlN: You mean you're still hiring me, Mr. McLintock?
Well, yes, sir. l mean, l'll certainly deliver a fair day's work.
G. W: For that, l'll pay you a fair day's wage.
You won't give me anything, and l won't give you anything.
We both hold up our heads.
Where do you live?
DEVLlN: The settlers' encampment down by the mine.
G. W: That your plug?
DEVLlN: Yes, sir.
G. W: Well, hop on him, and we'll go get your gear.
G. W: Ya! Ya!
Morning, Mr. McLintock.
G. W: Morning. l am sure that all you fine people are interested... in knowing just what portion of this new land... will be your new home.
Oh, uh... Jones and McCallister, since you've been more or less the leaders of our group, l'd like to have you come up and check the exact location.
DEVLlN: Won't be a minute, sir.
Go after that boy and give him $30.
Tell him McLintock pays his riders a month in advance.
DRAGO: From the looks of things they could sure use it, too.
DEVLlN: Oh, Ma, this is Mr. Drago.
DRAGO: Good morning.
DOUGLAS: Well, and to what do we owe this visit... from the cattle baron? l've got a touch of hangover, bureaucrat. Don't push me.
MAN: Whoa-ho, McLin!
Say, those are lndians.
Are there lndians in this homestead land?
Friendly lndians, my boy.
MAN: Whoa-ho, McLin.
G. W: Whoa-ho,
Running Buffalo.
Ho, McLin.
Long time we don't get drunk together.
And it's going to be a lot longer time... because it's against the law, and you're with a sheriff.
And have l got my hands full.
They came into town to meet the train.
The old lndian chiefs are coming home. l heard they'd been pardoned.
SHERlFF: They don't know when it's arriving... this week, next week, or next month, so, in the meantime, l've got to do something with them.
Could l cut out a couple of head of your steers to feed them?
Otherwise, some of these settlers' milk cows... are going to disappear.
That's right, McLin.
Ha ha ha!
Cut out whatever you need.
Sheriff, are you going to encamp these savages... with all these settlers?
You're asking for trouble.
Mr. Douglas, l already have plenty of trouble.
Please stay off my back.
Running Buffalo, bring your people over to the clay slide.
Hello, Mr. McLin.
Tiny Mouth, it's nice to see you!
You wouldn't believe it now, but 20 years ago, she was a mighty handsome maid.
20 years ago, you thought so, too, Mr. Douglas.
G. W: Ahem.
DOUGLAS: Ahem.
DRAGO: lt was just like this. l had a dead bead on old Running Buffalo, and my Sharp
.50 caliber misfired.
That was back in that trouble in the forties, remember?
G. W: l remember.
You want to taste something come directly from heaven?
No.
Where'd you get this?
That boy's mama baked 'em.
You thinking the same thing l am?
She's a widow woman, Boss, and she's got a long, hard road to hoe.
Hire her. l always said you had a heap of sense.
Mr. McLintock, this is my mother.
Your mother?
And my sister.
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. McLintock.
Ma'am, this here's my boss, and he has a few choice words to say about your biscuits.
Yes, Mr. McLintock?
Well... they're great.
G. W: Well, you old
Cantonese reprobate, how about it?
You fire me, l kill myself. l'm not talking about firing you. l'm retiring you.
You been rustling food for us for 30 years.
We're going to put you out to pasture.
All you'll have to do is give advice, be one of the family. l kill myself. l may save you the trouble.
Hey, Ching, you kill yourself, l'll cut off your pigtail, and you ain't never going to get to heaven. l'll be one of the family? l give you my solemn word.
Pretty crummy family... drink too much, get in fight, yell all the time.
Cut off his pigtail.
All right. All right. l'll be one of the family.
This is such a big house, it'll take me a while to get used to things.
Now, please don't hesitate to tell me if anything is wrong.
CHlNG:
No bird's-nest soup?
Otherwise, just fine.
Everything nice and fine.
DRAGO: Food's heavenly, ma'am.
CURLY:
Best apple pie l ever ate.
G. W: Curly's right, ma'am.
Hated to leave that last bite.
Shall we celebrate with a drink?
DRAGO: Carlos, come and help me with the dishes.
Alice, you want to help, too?
ALlCE: Yes, Drago.
DRAGO: All right.
Pitch in. l'll wash, and you kids can dry. ls that good?
MAN: Whoa.
Don't seem possible one woman could use all them clothes.
KATE:
You keep a civil tongue... in your unprepossessing face.
MAN: Yes, ma'am.
KATE:
And unload my baggage, please.
MAN: Yes, ma'am.
By the way, what does that word,
"unprepossessing," mean?
Mrs. McLintock.
KATE: Oh, hello, Carlos.
Run and help the driver with my luggage. l couldn't trust anyone else in this house... to do anything correctly.
G. W: Luggage?
Give him a hand, Curly.
CURLY: Yes, Boss.
Mr. McLintock.
Are you moving back in?
Yes, but nothing has changed except my place of residence, and l'd be willing to put up with savages... rather than be denied the company of my daughter, and l'm proving that by moving in here.
Mr. McLintock, since it's my first day, would you excuse me if l, uh...
G. W: Go ahead.
Oh, Katherine, this is Dev Warren.
He joined the outfit today.
DEV: Pleased, ma'am.
Thank you.
Well, how refreshing... a polite young man here.
Where did he come from?
G. W: He's a farmer.
KATE: A farmer?
DRAGO: Well, l'll be doggone!
Kate, welcome home.
What on earth are you doing in that idiotic-looking outfit?
And don't you dare call me Kate.
That's my butling suit. l'm butling for the boss.
And l'm sorry, Katherine.
That Kate kind of slipped out... from the times l remembered you as being nice peop... people.
Oh!
Are you going to stand there... with that stupid look on your face... while the hired help insults your wife?
He's just ignorant.
He doesn't know any better than to tell the truth.
And l can't help this stupid look. l started acquiring it as you gained in social prominence.
CURLY: Mrs. McLintock, where do you want l should put...
Put them in the master bedroom.
Yes, but move Mr. McLintock's things into another room.
Oh, the one back of the stairs would be best... so that he can't wake up the entire household... when he comes home every night just before daybreak.
CURLY: Yes, ma'am.
MRS. WARREN: Oh, excuse me.
Here's your cigars,
Mr. McLintock.
KATE: l am Mrs. McLintock.
DRAGO: Kate... l mean Katherine, this is the cook... this is the lady that does the cooking for us.
G. W: Mrs. Warren,
Mrs. McLintock.
KATE: How do you do.
Very pleased to meet you,
Mrs. McLintock. Very pleased.
Likewise.
MRS. WARREN: You see, l just came to work here today, and l guess l jumped to the conclusion... that this was a bachelor's household. lt is, and then again, it isn't. l will explain... so everything will be quite clear, Mrs. Wallace...
EVERYONE: Mrs. Warren.
Mrs. Warren. lt has been a bachelor's household for quite some time, and it will be again just as soon as l'm out of here, which will be as quickly as l can make arrangements... to take my daughter back east with me.
You see, she's coming home from school in a few days, and then we'll be off together, and you can return to conducting yourself... as you consider proper in a bachelor's household.
Katie!
Shut up!
Until then, l am mistress in this house, and l will give the orders.
You gonna let her? Ain't you gonna say nothing, boss?
No!
KATE: Oh, G.W., as soon as my things are put away, l want to talk to you about Rebecca.
G. W: Yes, Mrs. McLintock. lndeed, Mrs. McLintock.
Of course, Mrs. McLintock.
The toast... lightly browned and unbuttered.
Of course, ma'am.
Wait a minute now, Boss, where do you think you're going?
G. W: l just remembered l got a date.
DRAGO: But she said she want to have a talk with you.
G. W: l heard.
G. W: Good evening, Lem.
LEM: Good evening, Mr. Mac.
Say, Mr. Mac, what does unprepossessing mean?
G. W: l was called that once, Lem.
Looked it up in the dictionary. lt's best you don't know what it means.
LEM: Uh-huh. Thank you.
Giddyap.
DRAGO: Hey, what am l going to tell her... when she asks where you went?
G. W: When in doubt, tell the truth.
She wouldn't expect that from you anyway.
CURLY:
Where's Mr. McLintock going?
DRAGO: There he goes, burning his last bridge.
DRAGO: You see a yellow streak about a foot wide... running up and down his backbone?
On Mr. McLintock?
Uh-huh.
He ain't afraid of nothing. l once thought that.
Drago.
Yes, ma'am?
Was that, uh...
He took off. Lit out. l told him l wanted to talk to him.
Yes, ma'am. l was standing right over here when you said it, and l was standing right on those front steps... when he walked up to a horse, grabbed a hunk of mane, stepped up on him, and sunk spur.
Where did he go?
Last time l saw him, he was going east, but you know him.
He's liable to go north, south, or west.
Get me a carriage.
Yes, ma'am, but...
But what?
Maybe you shouldn't follow him... into maybe where he's going into.
What does that mean? l don't know, but l wish l hadn't-a said it.
Well, just get the carriage.
Yes, ma'am.
What happened?
Get the barouche.
Barouche?
Hitch it up.
She wants to go to town.
But Mr. McLintock never said anything to me about it.
Look, young fella, l'm the ramrod around this place, and you better start giving me a "Yes, sir," or you're going to get the roof of this house... pulled down on your head.
Yes, sir.
G. W: Hello, Davey.
DAVEY: Hi, Mr. McLintock.
G. W: New broom, eh?
DAVEY: Sweeps clean.
G. W: Hello, Bunny.
How is everything?
BUNNY:
Oh, fine, fine, Mr. McLintock. l'll get you next time.
Two more, Elmer.
Well, look who's here.
What'll it be, Mac?
Same as usual?
Ladies.
Evening, G.W.
Jake.
JAKE: Wrong move.
G. W: What?
JAKE: The chess problem.
Queen's in danger.
MAN: Whoa. Whoa.
KATE: l suppose you can do that.
G. W: Camille, you're on your own.
Mrs. McLintock. l'm Camille...
Camille Reedbottom. l... l'm, uh, learning the game of chess.
Thought it would give me something to pass the time.
See, l have nothing to do all day long. l... uh... l just remembered something.
JAKE: Katherine! l didn't hear you come in.
KATE: Mr. McLintock, l told you that l wanted to talk to you.
G. W: Not now.
JAKE: Uh, could l get you a glass of sherry, Katherine?
KATE: Oh, thank you,
Mr. Birnbaum. l could use one. l came into town behind a runaway team!
G. W: Drago never could handle horses. lt was that young man whose mother pretends to be your cook!
Katherine, your wine.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Birnbaum.
Now, Mr. McLintock, we have an awful lot to talk over.
First thing l learned about lndian fighting... was to wait for daylight.
And what does our conversation got to do with lndian fighting? lndian fighting is good experience... for our kind of conversations.
KATE: Oh! lt'll wait, Katherine.
DEV: Evening, Sheriff,
Mr. McLintock.
We had quite a ride out here.
Oh, l finally got that team settled down.
G. W: lt's your move.
JAKE: No, it's your move. l just canceled it.
KATE: Now, look here.
You're not going to sit here all night long and play chess... when the matter of our daughter remains unsettled.
G. W: l am going to remain here and play chess, and the matter of our daughter is settled. She stays.
KATE: Oh, such stubbornness!
JAKE: Katherine.
Your hair.
Oh, it is a mess after that awful ride.
JAKE: No, no. The tricks a man's memory will play, uh?
Mr. Birnbaum, l think that you've... completely lost your mind.
You have done something to your hair. l have not! lf l had, it would be none of your business. l'm certainly not going to put myself in the place... of those blondene trollops that you seem to prefer.
G. W: Fill it.
DEVLlN: Oh.
You fellas still at it all night?
JAKE: A McLintock never quits, but a Birnbaum has to.
Besides, the game is over.
You got me.
Oh, no, Mr. Birnbaum.
You still got a good game.
JAKE: Oh, you play chess.
Please, take over.
Pretty good?
Fair.
Well, looks like l won't have to come into town always... to get a game.
Remember, l'm a bad loser. lt's your move.
DEVLlN: Yes, sir.
Good morning.
Good morning. ls it morning already?
Hmm-mm.
Cup of coffee?
Oh, yes. Thanks, Jake.
You're welcome, Katherine.
KATE: Got any cream?
JAKE: Canned cow's milk.
That'll do.
JAKE: Good old condensed milk.
That reminds me. l was cleaning out my desk the other day, and l found something l wanted to return to you.
Here it is.
"From the president of the
United States of America..."
"to first sergeant
Michael Patrick Gilhooly..."
"for bravery above and beyond the call of duty." lt's your papa.
Reminds me of the first time l ever saw you. lt was over 17 years ago.
You walked into my store... not much bigger than the bundle you were carrying.
And in the bundle was the most beautiful baby l ever saw.
And was she hungry!
You walked all the way from Superstition Creek... just to trade me that medal for a case of canned milk.
G.W. was off somewhere, as usual, fighting lndians.
MAN: Sheriff!
Sheriff Lord!
Well, have you seen the sheriff?
SECOND MAN: Kind of early for him. Did you try his house?
FlRST MAN: Now, why didn't l think of that?
DOUGLAS:
Looks like Birnbaum's is open.
Maybe somebody in here knows.
So there you are, Sheriff. l told you you were headed for trouble.
SHERlFF: Trouble?
MAN: l want to know by whose authority... you let those lndians stay in town.
Those savages are wards of the government, and l am the representative of that government...
G. W: l told Sheriff Lord that he could put them up... down by the clay slide.
Because the town's named after him, he thinks he owns it.
Well, you check the books in the recorder's office, and you'll find l do own a fair piece of it.
Agard, if you knew anything about lndians, you'd know that they're doing their level best... to put up with our so-called benevolent patronage... in spite of the nincompoops that have been put in charge of it.
Those lndians need my permission to leave the reservation.
Those chiefs have been giving orders all their lives. lt's pretty hard for them to understand... that they have to hold up their hand... like a schoolboy in a classroom.
AGARD: The law is very clear. l told you you'd get no satisfaction from these people.
We'll get the girl back.
G. W: Girl?
DOUGLAS: The girl the lndians kidnapped, but don't worry. l armed the settlers... and set them to rounding up those red devils.
SHERlFF:
What is this about a girl?
Millie Jones... one of the settler's daughters.
The lndians kidnapped her.
SHERlFF: That's ridiculous.
And you turned loose a lot of farmers with shotguns?
DOUGLAS: l certainly did.
G. W: You're insane.
Let's go, Sheriff.
KATE: Mr. Douglas.
DOUGLAS: Oh, Mrs. McLintock.
KATE: Much as l hate to agree with G.W. about anything, you haven't changed a bit.
You're still an hysterical fool.
DRAGO:
Come into town. l got worried.
G. W: What about?
DRAGO: Thought maybe
Katie shot you.
KATE: Not yet, Drago, but it took restraint.
SHERlFF: Wait a minute.
You better take Agard along, not that he'll be much help.
G. W: Drago, help him on the horse.
AGARD: Just a minute.
KATE: l'll drive.
DEV: Yes, ma'am.
G. W: Agard, what are you doing?
DRAGO: Snatch him, Agard!
DOUGLAS: Agard, this is serious.
DRAGO: Stay with him, Agard.
Stay with him.
Agard, will you stop showing off and get in this buggy!
Mercy.
Mercy.
DRAGO:
That horse is a little green.
G. W: Let's go. Ya!
G. W: Just where do you think you're going?
KATE: Don't use that range boss tone of voice with me!
G. W: Carter!
We're headed for Mr. Poorboy's mine.
Mount up some riders.
Right, Boss.
You heard the man!
DAVEY: l don't like it,
Mr. McLintock. l don't like it one bit.
G. W: What don't you like?
DAVEY: They're planning to hang an lndian!
Sheriff very funny.
Where's the whiskey?
Ha ha!
G. W: Hold it!
Not so fast,
Mr. Boss of the Whole Country, unless you want to wear a big hole in your middle.
How long is G.W. going to let that cheechako push him around?
That cheechako has a sawed-off shotgun.
How do you know she didn't wander off someplace, or meet some fella or something?
What are you saying?
That l didn't raise my girl right?
That she'd wander off all night with some man?
There's a lot of things l'm not saying to you, mister, while you got a sawed-off shotgun in my middle.
But how do you know this lndian had anything to do with it?
She's gone, ain't she?
She's gone!
MlLLlE: Pa!
Pa, l'm over here!
Pa!
Been looking for me, Pa?
Where you been, gal?
Young Ben took me for a sunrise ride, and the horse wandered away.
- You come down off of there!
- But, Pa!
She's telling the truth,
Mr. McLintock.
We wasn't doing nothing.
Well, that's not important right now.
The important thing is that you don't draw that hog-legg, or this'll be worse than
Dodge City on Saturday night.
But, Papa!
You get on back to the wagon! l'll tend to you later.
Now for this young whippersnapper!
Now, no harm has been done, and Young Ben here... is one of the nicest boys in the territory.
So just put down that shotgun, and let's forget it. l'll teach him to fool with my...
Aah! Oof!
Now... we'll all calm down.
Boss, he's just a little excited. l know, l know. l'm going to use good judgment. l haven't lost my temper in 40 years.
But, pilgrim, you caused a lot of trouble this morning.
Might have got somebody killed.
And somebody ought to belt you in the mouth!
But l won't. l won't.
The hell l won't!
Oomf!
McLintock rider!
MEN: Yee-ha!
RUNNlNG BUFFALO: Ha haa!
Oh, McLin!
Hey, Buster... remember me?
Aah!
Well, sir... nice party.
Do you think you ought to? l ought to what?
Why, you great big...
MAN: Yeeow!
SECOND MAN: Aaah!
Hey, good party!
Great party!
AGARD: Hey! Wait! l want to work with you.
Hey, just a minute!
What... what are you...
My glasses!
Hey, now, stop this, or you'll be sorry!
Oh, for heaven's sake!
G. W:
Stay out of this, Jake.
JAKE: lt's everybody's war!
Aah!
Run, Old Paint!
RUNNlNG BUFFALO: Whoa, McLin!
Where's the whiskey?
RUNNlNG BUFFALO:
Where's the whiskey?
Good fight, good fight!
Oh, sorry, McLintock.
Oh...
Oh ho, McLin!
Thanks.
Ha ha! Very funny!
Yeah. Very funny.
MAN: Ohhh!
Gosh, Mr. Douglas, l'm sorry!
Bon voyage, Drago! Aah!
MAN: Hey!
Are you still down here?
Sage!
Horse wandered away, huh?
Honest, Mr. Jones.
Honest...
Oh... get out of my way!
Nice left.
Thanks. l went to college!
For this, you don't need college!
You're not getting me down there!
MAN: Aaah!
Owwww!
You beast!
You did this on purpose!
Oooh!
Why, McLintock, you big...
Good morning to you,
Mrs. McLintock.
Bunny, you big... oaf!
G. W: Yeeoowie!
G. W: Oh, no!
G.W. McLintock, you big... great big clumsy...
G. W: Well, it's pretty hard to control yourself...
DRAGO: People, people, people!
Ohh! Ohh!
RUNNlNG BUFFALO: Oh, McLin!
Well, McLin, what a party!
But no whiskey.
We go home.
You and your friends!
Well, we at least saved your hat.
Oh!
Where is everybody?
Oh, for heaven's sakes!
DRAGO: Whoa! Whoa!
KATE: Drago, will you never learn how to handle a team?
DRAGO: Yes, ma'am, l'll sure try. l'll tell you that, now.
CHlNG: Crummy family!
DRAGO: You want to lose your pigtail?
CHlNG: l lose face!
Lousy leathertips!
DRAGO:
You'll lose more than that!
- Kate!
- Yes?
We could be a big help to one another.
KATE:
Like what, may l ask?
Well, we could wash the mud off of each other.
We used to have quite good times doing that sort of thing.
There are a lot of things we used to do.
Good night, Mr. McLintock!
Any luck?
What are you talking about? l mean divorce!
She still want it?
Yeah.
You know something, women are funny.
She fought like a wildcat on your side... out there this afternoon.
Come home... she slams the door in your face.
That divorce business... is that what you get... when you pay a woman not to live with you?
That's about it.
Some women l've knowed, it'd be worth it.
You know, if we had any moral character, we wouldn't be standing here, covered with mud, drinking... when we should be washing.
G.W.
Drago.
Mrs. Warren, these biscuits... mmmm!
Why, thank you, Drago.
Good morning, Mrs. Warren.
Good morning, Mr. McLintock.
One poached egg, tea, toast, lightly browned and un...
Why, Mrs. McLintock... you have a black eye! l do? Oooh!
Oh! Ohh... and Becky's coming home today.
MRS. WARREN:
And that's not all.
There's a little something we'd better get settled.
KATE: Hmm?
There are no men listening now, so we can be ourselves.
Oh, sure, l let you get away... with all that guff the other night, but now that we're alone...
When l want the opinion of the hired help, l'll ask for it.
You know, you could wind up with two black eyes.
What?
Oh... l realize you had to put on that big act.
We always have to, just before we get ready to forgive them... generally for something they haven't done.
But you and l both know... that's just to keep them from getting the idea they, uh... run things.
McLintock give you that black eye?
No! Nobody gave it to me. l won it.
MAN: Morning, Davey.
Morning, Mrs. Beech.
Mr. Beech.
Why, Miss Becky, welcome home!
Mr. Douglas!
JUNlOR: Hi, Dad!
DOUGLAS: My boy! Ha ha ha!
JUNlOR: lt's good to see you again!
Daddy! Oh! lt's been two long years! l guess l'm going to have to stop calling you tomboy!
KATE: Becky.
- Mama! Oh, Mama!
- Oh, darling!
- l wasn't sure you'd be here.
- Oh, l've been here a few days.
Oh, Becky, l've bought you three of the most beautiful dresses!
Oh, ma...
Uncle Drago! Ohh!
Did you bring your old uncle a coming-home present?
- Sure did!
- What is it?
A mustache cup!
And what did you get me?
Prettiest palomino pony that ever packed a saddle. Broke.
Ohh!
Uncle Jake! Ohh!
What are you doing with Mr. Douglas' tuba?
Oh, Mr. Douglas has a fat... had a little accident.
You know, l brought you a whole shipment of licorice sticks!
But now that l've seen how much you've grown, l think we better exchange them... for a couple of bolts of dress goods, huh?
Thank you!
Oh, the mayor was going to be here, but he had to go to the territorial capital... on a horse theft matter.
But l'm going to give his speech.
Oh, and don't worry about the mayor. l'm sure that he can find the bill of sale for the horse.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to welcome the fairest...
What am l doing?
We are here to welcome back... the prettiest girl that was ever born in McLintock, or in any part of the territory.
Now, this...
MAN: Hey, Davey!
- Yeah?
- Got something for you!
Yard manager up at the junction told me to let them ride, so l locked them in here. l've had my scalp a long time, and l aim to keep it!
And now she's come back to us.
Gone are the pigtails.
But the freckles are still on the prettiest face... that was ever born in McLintock.
Hey, that's Puma.
Then it's true. The government did turn them loose.
Good old Puma. l'll never forget when he brought G.W. home.
Your father had a hole in his chest and a 104 fever.
Of course, they weren't very mannerly about it.
He came past the house at a high lope... and threw him on the doorstep.
Then you do remember them good old days, don't you, Katie?
Katherine.
(l)Yatahe, (/l) my friends.
(l)Yatahe.
G. W: Puma, honored enemy.
Does Big McLintock forget we're also blood brothers?
No, l'll never forget that.
Old wound... does it hurt still? l feel it when it comes on to rain.
An inch higher, and l wouldn't have had to worry.
Aw, Big McLintock, that was remembered fight.
We return with news.
Our people have more trouble.
You see, l learn good English now, Big McLintock.
Learned in white man's jail.
But we would have you talk our cause at government hearing. l understand that
Governor Humphreys... is going to preside at that meeting.
Yes, Puma, l'll translate your wishes.
AGARD: Mr. McLintock, uh... could l impose upon you to use your Comanche... to tell these chiefs that...
Puma is chief of the Comanches, and he speaks English very well.
Oh, well...
Your people will have to follow my instructions to the letter.
- lt is the law of the land...
- We go.
Well, now, just a minute...
Well, for heaven's sakes!
You wait here, honey. l'll get the buggy.
Are you going to the McLintock party?
Surely.
Will l see you there, Beth?
Of course, Davey, and you can have the first dance.
Sis! Come on. l don't want any sister of mine talking to strangers.
Davey's not a stranger.
He clerks in Birnbaum's.
He's an lndian.
DEV: Darn you, Drago!
Now look what you've done.
Baby, this is Devlin Warren.
He works for your papa.
Dev, this is
Miss Becky McLintock.
BECKY: Those are my things.
Yes, ma'am.
Aw, l'd have known you anywhere, Miss Becky.
What do you mean?
Oh! l mean, you look so much like your mother.
Well, even prettier!
Well, Mr. Warren...
Mother's much prettier than l am.
Many a fight's started with words like that.
Come on, get in the buggy.
BECKY: Hello, Ching!
We got jelly pie for dinner?
CHlNG: l'm not cooking!
No, he's not.
BECKY: Junior!
Yes, Miss Becky!
You remember
Junior Douglas, Mama.
Oh, of course. How's college?
Valedictorian. 95.
KATE: Oh, congratulations!
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Douglas, we will see you at the party, of course?
Oh, delighted!
Well, it'll be pretty hard to keep young Matt away.
Yes, sir!
G. W: Drago!
DRAGO: Yes, Boss, baggage all loaded.
KATE: G.W.!
You remember young Junior.
Oh, yes.
Like father, like son.
JUNlOR: Oh, uh,
Mr. McLintock, uh... l hope you don't think l'm being presumptuous... in asking for the honor of calling on Miss Rebecca.
Well, there she is.
Ask her yourself.
Well, thank you, sir!
Ching, now l'm gonna get fired.
Giddyap out of here!
JUNlOR: Thank you, sir.
Thank you!
KATE: Have you no manners?
BECKY: See you at the party, Junior!
G. W: Yeah. Yeah.
DOUGLAS: Yeah what?
G. W: Like father, like son.
What did he mean, Matthew?
DRAGO: Come on, Ching, grab a root and growl.
MRS. WARREN: Well, you're doing a good job, Miss McLintock.
BECKY: Thank you, Mrs. Warren.
MRS. WARREN: Dev!
When you're finished there, go over and help Drago with the beer kegs.
Yes, Mom.
Uh, Dev... could you come and help me a minute? l certainly was surprised to hear you went to college.
DEVLlN: Why?
BECKY: l don't know.
Junior says Purdue's a good college... for a backwater place like lndiana.
Well, he did, indeed.
Oh, could you do this? l can't reach it.
Why didn't you finish college?
Lack of funds.
My father got sick, and he had to come out west.
So he took out a homestead.
BECKY: You know, your mom's sure cute. lt's, uh, too bad you didn't inherit her eyes.
Well, you'd been lucky... if you'd inherited a few things from your father.
Oh, really? For instance?
His common sense, for instance.
Common sense?
Yeah. You don't see him being fooled... by some dude like Junior Douglas.
Junior's not a dude!
He's nifty.
This needs a woman's touch.
And besides, he got a letter at college.
What sport?
Glee club.
Very strenuous.
Hmmph! Oooh!
Oh! Don't you dare hug me!
Ooh!
DEV: l have no intention of hugging you.
Oooh!
BEN: Ladies all look lovely, Katherine.
You know, this is a real fine party.
Oh, thank you, Ben.
Of course, we had to invite everybody.
Just everybody.
MAN: Sorry, G.W., this one's mine.
Well, thank you,
Mrs. Warren. l guess l'll have to be a good host in my own home.
Well, the next one's yours,
Mr. McLintock.
Thank you.
Drago, go and do what l told you to do.
Oh, Katie!
Katherine!
And do as you're told!
Ohh, Drago do this,
Drago do that!
DRAGO: Yee-ha!
People, people, people!
This Douglas feller...
KATE: Drago!
DRAGO: Yes, ma'am.
Matt Douglas, Jr... is going to bring you folks... some of the latest terpsichorean dance steps... brand-new, brought by him directly from New York City.
All right, Mr. Fiddler.
Give me a whiskey!
What?
This turn a ten-gallon party, boss.
We are run out of whiskey.
Well, l can take care of that, Ching.
YOUNG BEN: lndian! lndian!
And you still got any ideas about asking my sister to dance, get up, and we can do this all over again.
DAVEY: Yes!
JAKE: That's enough!
You fought it! lt's all over!
YOUNG BEN:
Quit butting in, Birnbaum!
He's a hired man, not your son!
JAKE: Look, you fought him fair and square!
DEV: l don't think it was so fair and square.
Well, you want to take up where he left off? lf l did, you wouldn't find it so easy.
JAKE: Now, we've had enough of this!
YOUNG BEN: When are you going to quit walking away?
DEV: Just as soon as we're out of sight of the party.
A little lesson l learned back home:
Don't fight in front of women.
YOUNG BEN:
Well, we're out of sight now.
DEV: So we are.
Such vulgarity.
Someone should do something about it.
You're right. Absolutely right.
You all right, Young Ben? l'm all right,
Mr. McLintock.
Pretty fancy fighting for a country boy.
Two years at Purdue,
Mr. McLintock, on the boxing team.
YOUNG BEN: l never thought any farmer could whip me, but you sure did.
Better get him cleaned up.
Get him some water, Jake.
JAKE: Yeah.
Well, get yourself cleaned up.
Go ask that girl for a dance.
DEV: Who?
Oh!
Did l miss one?
FAUNTLEROY: Where is he? l'll find him, that young whippersnapper!
G. W: Trouble.
FAUNTLEROY: Where is that farmer boy? Where is he?
Where is he, G.W.?
Oh, so you're the young farmer boy... that whipped my nephew!
Well, l'm Fauntleroy Sage,
Young Ben's uncle.
Well, l'm no farmer, but if you're Young Ben's uncle, yes, l whipped him, and you're intruding.
What's "intruding" mean?
Butting in.
Oh, so he's insulting me!
Well, then l got another reason for walloping him, besides on account of him thrashing my nephew Young Ben.
Fauntleroy, you can't get mixed up in these youngsters' quarrel.
Family honor. l can't have it said a farmer whipped a Sage!
You're twice his size.
Don't let that bother you, Mr. McLintock. lf Mr. Fauntleroy insists, l'll just have to teach him the same lesson.
Say!
FAUNTLEROY:
Sorry, young feller.
FAUNTLEROY: Hate to have to do that, young fella.
No hard feelings.
DEV: Not yet.
G. W: Not yet what?
DEV: l mean, that isn't all.
G. W: Now, wait a minute.
Fauntleroy, we're gonna make this a fair fight.
Course we are.
Course we are, G.W.
There'll be none of this. l wouldn't do that, G.W.
You wouldn't do...
FAUNTLEROY:
Nooo, l wouldn't do that!
And, Dev... l don't want you kicking
Fauntleroy in the knee.
He didn't do no such thing!
And none of this nose-twisting.
He's all yours.
AGARD: Where are my glasses?
You all right, young feller?
Ouch! l'm all right... if this lndian agent will stop stepping all over me.
G.W., you was just funning me, but l want you to know that boy fought me a fair fight.
Well, l'm glad to hear that, Fauntleroy.
YOUNG BEN: Where's my uncle?
Fauntleroy, what have you been doing? l hope my uncle didn't bother anybody.
DEV: No bother.
G. W: l think we'd better join the ladies... before they get curious.
Drago!
DRAGO: Fauntleroy, let's line them all up for a do-si-do.
Jake, you think tincture of arnica would help?
JAKE: Could be.
Used to help you.
Gentlemen, to the medicine cabinet.
Good morning, Drago.
Morning, Becky.
You seen Daddy?
Took off early this morning with a scatter gun over his arm.
Went hunting.
Oh.
Morning, Daddy.
Good afternoon.
What gets you out so early? lt's something l have to get straight in my mind.
G. W: Yeah?
What?
Mama.
Why did you and Mama stop living together, Daddy?
Why did you separate?
Aren't you going to answer me?
G. W: Nope. lt's sort of my business, l think. l don't. ls it another woman?
Usually is.
At your age, you always know what's usual. ls it Mrs. Warren?
Becky, l don't want to start laying the law down... your first day back home, but l'll have no more such talk.
The first time l ever saw
Mrs. Warren was last week.
She has a job here at which she's very good, and l hope you'll have the good manners... to not pry into other people's business...
Your mother's and mine.
Pretty good shot, Daddy.
Oh, l can understand your trouble.
Mama's often so, well, so petulant.
Petulant?
You learned a lot of words back east, Becky. l wished to God they would have taught you some meanings.
You were only about six months old... when your mother stayed alone with you in a sod hut... under eight foot of snow... while l moved the herd 300 miles south to try and save it.
Saved about half of it.
You were a little more than a year old... at the time of the great Comanche raids.
We stood off 500
Plains lndians for nine days.
Petulant, Becky? l think you better go on home.
See that Ching gets those birds.
Becky!
Come here.
There's something l ought to tell you.
Guess now is as good a time as any.
You're going to have every young buck... west of the Missouri around here trying to marry you, mostly because you're a handsome filly, but partly because l own everything in this country... from here to there.
They'll think you're going to inherit it.
Well, you're not. l'm going to leave most of it to... well, to the nation, really, for a park where no lumbermen will cut down all the trees... for houses with leaky roofs.
Nobody will kill all the beaver for hats for dudes... nor murder the buffalo for robes.
What l'm going to give you is a 500-cow spread... on the upper Green River.
Now, that may not seem like much, but it's more than we had, your mother and l.
Some folks are going to say l'm doing all this... so l can sit up in the hereafter... and look down on a park named after me, or that l was disappointed in you, didn't want you to get all that money.
But the real reason, Becky, is because l love you, and l want you and some young man to have what l had, because all the gold in the United States Treasury... and all the harp music in heaven... can't equal what happens between a man and a woman... with all that growing together. l can't explain it any better than that.
All right, Daddy.
Becky!
When you're as old as l am, you'll thank me for this.
Daddy, l'm full-grown. l wasn't worrying about me. l was thinking about you and Mama.
Oh.
JUNlOR: Well, sir, all three of them fell... right out of the carriage.
KATE: Well, it's getting rather late, Becky. lt's bedtime.
Oh, Mother, he brought this.
He must have intended to use it.
Sing us a song.
JUNlOR: Well, if you really want me to.
Gosh, l haven't played...
BECKY:
You know (l)Just Right for Me?
JUNlOR: Sure.
BECKY: lt's the rage now.
JUNlOR: Oh.
Dev, what are you doing?
DEV: Oh, l, uh... l just thought l'd get another cigar.
Well, you've got one in your mouth... and two burning in the tray.
And that move.
JUNlOR: The fellas want me to play all the time.
You're cuter than
A baby steer
And softer than
A mouse's ear l want the whole wide world to hear
You're just right for me
You're sweeter than...
Oh, no, not that rhythm, Junior.
Do it the way they do it at the Plaza. l know the words.
Sure, Becky.
Will you sing with me?
Of course. l love a man who's witty and smart
And clever lt's your move.
Oh.
BECKY: My heart forever
Oh, Dev, you're playing like an amateur.
Let's call it an evening. l'd like to know where your mind is tonight.
JUNlOR AND BECKY:
You're sweeter than
The early spring
Or bluebells when they start to...
Pretty good.
Voice like her father.
You're just right for me
Sweeter than honey
Finer than wine l'm sure they found you
On that honeysuckle vine
JUNlOR: l would melt ln your embrace
BECKY: You'd disappear
Without a trace
JUNlOR: To die like this ls no disgrace
This is the time
This is the place
For you're
Just right for me
Well, it's so good, l kind of hate to break this up, but we're going to have... that lndian hearing tomorrow morning...
Sir, about our conversation earlier this evening, l believe l'd better apologize.
G. W: Yeah?
Yes, sir, l've been thinking it over, and when l called you a reactionary, well, that's merely my generation's... term for your generation.
Well, good night, sir.
Good night, Mrs. McLintock.
KATE: Good night and do come again.
JUNlOR: Good night, Drago.
DRAGO: Good night.
Boss... what does reactionary mean?
Me, l guess.
He says that anyone that wanted to sell at a profit... was a reactionary.
Was we reactionaries back in them days... when you was selling beef cattle... for six cents a pound on the hoof?
Well, no use arguing with him.
College boy.
Devlin Warren, if you was my kind of man, you wouldn't let some dude... walk off with the prettiest girl west of Denver... without putting up some kind of fight.
Does it show?
What can l do? l'm just one of her father's employees. l'm just a hired hand around here.
Every so often, Dev, you spill the strangest ideas.
Everybody works for somebody.
Me, l work for everybody in these United States... that steps into a butcher's shop for a T-bone steak, and you work for me.
There's not much difference.
Daddy, the most terrible thing just happened!
Junior's horse ran away, the one he rented at the livery stable.
You tied up a rented horse by the reins?
He's probably back in the stall by now. l think we can get Junior something that he can ride.
What l'd rather do, Daddy, is drive Junior home in our barouche. lt's a lovely evening, and l'm sure Uncle Drago wouldn't mind driving. l would, and l got the kind of manners... don't keep me from saying so just to be polite. l'll drive him home,
Mr. McLintock, and you don't have to come, Miss Becky. l'll see that he gets home safely. l can take care of myself.
You got yourself a foot, didn't you?
Dev, get the carriage.
Drago. l'm going with them.
DRAGO: Now you got me wrangling dudes.
You make a man feel like a king
You're just right for me
Miss Becky, somebody better help me watch the road.
You know, l'm new around here.
Might take the wrong turnoff.
Devlin Warren, you know there isn't a turnoff... between here and town.
You disappear without a trace
To die like this ls no disgrace
This is the time
This is the place
DEV: Yah! Yah!
Devlin Warren, what are you trying to do, kill us?
Would you rather have your friend drive?
Yah!
Daddy! Daddy! l have never been so humiliated in my entire life! l said what l said, and l'll stand by it to the death.
Shoot him, Daddy.
Shoot him at once.
Well, why?
My honor is at stake.
Well, now, your honor.
Absolutely.
He impugned my honor. lmpugned? What does that mean?
- Slander! He slandered my honor!
- He did? l said what l said, and l'll stand by it to the death.
He admits it! See?
Shoot him!
Well, what is he admitting to?
Why, he called me a... l won't even repeat the word. l didn't necessarily call you anything, but l said what l said, and l'll stand by it to the death.
Well, just for the tally books, what did you say? l said that any girl who would permit a man to kiss her... before they're formally engaged is a trollop.
He said it again! Shoot him!
Now, hold on.
No, don't hold on! lf you're my father, if you love me, you'll shoot him.
Well, l'm your father... and l sure love you... so...
Oh, you shot him!
You really shot him! lf he dies... lf he dies, he'll be the first man ever killed with a blank cartridge.
We use this to start the races on the Fourth.
DEV: Hey, l'm on fire!
Oh, you poor dear!
Poor dear! You'd have had me shot in cold blood!
But it didn't happen.
Yelling l insulted you and all!
What you need is a good spanking!
Oh, Dev! Daddy!
Leave me out of this!
Oh, l think l'll give you what you deserve.
- You wouldn't dare!
- Oh, wouldn't l?
You'll think next time before you have someone shot!
This kicking and yelling isn't going to help!
Don't! Daddy, wait a minute! Daddy!
Daddy, help me! Don't!
Devlin Warren, l hate you! l hate you!
G.W., was that a shot?
Ohh!
Becky, what happened?
He spanked me!
You spanked my daughter?
Dev.
KATE: Ohh!
You mean you stood there while that brute beat our daughter?
G.W., what's happened to you in the last three years?
Better part of valor, son.
KATE: lsn't it enough that you've always treated me... like a squaw without subjecting dear, sweet Becky... to this crude, vulgar...
Katherine, you women are always raising hell about one thing... when it's something else you're really sore about.
Don't you think it's about time you told me... what put the burr under your saddle about me? l don't intend to stand here... and hold a midnight conversation... with an intoxicated man.
And l am not intoxicated!
Yet!
Hello, Governor!
Hello, Governor!
Chief Puma.
Yes, Sergeant.
Big McLintock, we know you'll get us fair judgment.
SERGEANT:
You gentlemen, follow me.
Well, Jake.
G.W.
Well, G.W., it's been a long time.
G. W: Not long enough...
Cuthbert.
Your husband is a rude man.
Yes, Cuthbert, l know.
Where you want the lndians,
Mr. McLintock?
Mr. McLintock is not running this hearing.
Sergeant, seat those lndians.
Yes, sir.
Gentlemen, be seated.
Their whole tribe here wanted to come into town.
Proceed, Lieutenant.
This hearing is now in session,
Governor Cuthbert Humphreys presiding.
BECKY: Good luck, Daddy.
G. W: l'm afraid it's a packed court.
MAN:
Government edict number 826.
"As ordered that the Comanche nation be transferred..."
"from their present reservation to Fort Sill,"
"it is the government's claim as filed by lndian agent Agard..."
"that these chiefs, after being released from prison..."
"by a kindly government..."
"did then rouse and incite defiance among the tribe..."
"against said order." lt seems, gentlemen, that although some of these chiefs speak English...
Chief Puma is quite at home in our language... they have chosen Mr. McLintock to be their spokesman.
G. W: l speak for the Comanche... or rather l offer this translation.
Proceed, Mr. McLintock.
We are an old people and a proud people.
When the White Man first came among us, we were as many as the grasses of the prairie.
Now we are few, but we are still proud.
For if a man lose his pride and manhood, he is nothing.
You tell us now that if we will let you send us away... to this place called Fort Sill, you will feed us and care for us.
Let us tell you this: lt is a Comanche law that no chief ever eats... unless first he sees that the pots are full of meat... in the lodges of the widows and orphans. lt is the Comanche way of life.
This that the White Man calls charity... is a fine thing for widows and orphans, but no warrior can accept it, for if he does, he is no longer a man... and when he is no longer a man, he is nothing... and better off dead.
You say to the Comanche,
"You are widows and orphans.
You are not men."
And we the Comanches say we would rather be dead. lt will not be a remembered fight when you kill us, because we are few now and have few weapons, but we will fight, and we will die Comanche.
Thank you, Big McLintock.
Am l to gather the Comanche defy... the government of the United States?
Yes, you may gather that the Comanche defy... the United States government... or at least this commission.
HUMPHREYS: Gentlemen. lt is the order of this court... that these chiefs be incarcerated until such time... as the detachment of United States cavalry... be made available to escort them and the Comanche nation... to Fort Sill.
This court is adjourned.
PUMA: McLintock, you are important chief... amongst these white people.
Sway them.
Have them give us few guns to make the fight worthwhile.
Let us have one last remembered fight for end of Comanche. l almost wish l could arrange that, Puma.
(G.W. and Puma speaking Comanche)
Sergeant!
Yes.
Left, right, carry on.
Gentlemen! lt's sad, these changing times. lt isn't the times that are changing, Mama.
Hi, G.W.
Hello, Lem.
Bunny.
Oh, howdy, McLintock.
Figured you'd be belly-down drunk by now. l've been doing some thinking drinking, Bunny. ls that boxcar still on the siding?
BUNNY: Well, sure, but...
G. W: But what?
BUNNY: l don't like it.
G. W: You don't, eh?
BUNNY: You figure if them lndians get out of there... and lead the cavalry on a wild goose chase, that Great White Father's going to get nosy.
G. W: Get nosy, and he'll investigate, and when they find out... how that sidesaddle governor's been messing things up, they'll give those lndians a fair trial.
BUNNY: That's live ammunition in that boxcar.
You know what will happen... if them lndians get some guns in their hands?
Somebody is going to get hurt. ls Puma's word good enough for you?
BUNNY: Well, l don't...
McLintock, you got yourself a partner.
G. W: Leave me out of this.
Hey, McLintock...
Ha ha ha.
Good night, Bunny.
Good night, Governor.
Governor!
Where is the Katie
With her light red hair?
Sweet as the roses
On the summer air
On the summer air l'll find her somewhere
While the moon is high
And tell her that l love her
And l'll love her till l die
The master's home!
Katie! Katie!
Katherine Gilhooly McLintock!
Where's the woman of the house?
MRS. WARREN:
Uh, Mr. McLintock.
G. W: Oh, there you...
Mrs. Warren!
Oh, good evening. l waited up for you,
Mr. McLintock.
G. W: Oh, how nice.
MRS. WARREN: l want to talk to you about something.
G. W:
Delighted, delighted.
309 times straight. l beg your pardon?
309 times straight, without a miss.
Got to be a record.
MRS. WARREN: l suppose so.
Now, Mr. McLintock, what l wanted to say...
Two-pound Stetson with
6-inch brim, 53 feet in the air. lt's got to be a record. l'm sure it is, but the reason l waited...
Dagnammit, woman, can't you hold that glass still?
Of course, sir.
Now...
Down the hatch to my world's record.
Down the hatch!
MRS. WARREN: Yes, sir.
And now... to the governor of our territory.
T-t-the governor of the territory, sir?
Now, don't you stick up for him,
Mrs. Warren.
You're a fine woman,
Mrs. Warren, but you'll certainly go down in my estimation... if you stick up for Cuthbert H. Humphreys, governor of this territory. l don't mean to change the...
G. W: Down the hatch.
Aw... yes sir.
Down the hatch.
Cuthbert H. Humphreys, governor of our territory, is a cull.
Do you know what a cull is, ma'am?
A cull is a specimen that is so worthless... that you have to cut him out of the herd.
Now, if all the people in the world were put in one herd,
Cuthbert is the one l would throw my rope at.
At whom, at whom l would throw my rope at.
Natural born cull.
Another touch, ma'am?
Oh, no, sir, no.
Well, l, l don't mind if l do.
G. W: Good.
You can't walk on one leg.
Oh, l didn't mean to be vulgar, ma'am.
Can't walk on one limb.
MRS. WARREN: lt's all right.
G. W: Sounds silly.
Only a bird can walk on a limb.
You know my wife?
Her name's Kate.
She insists on being called
Katherine.
Do you know her?
Of course, Mr. McLintock, and that's what l wanted to talk...
Well, she thinks that Cuthbert
H. Humphreys is panting... for her like a bull buffalo at the first green-up of spring.
But what Cuthbert is panting for is my money.
Don't make me feel like l'm drinking alone, ma'am.
Very well, Mr. McLintock, if you insist.
Down the hatch!
Good!
Mr. McLintock... l have something very important to say to you.
Very important.
Guess it'll have to wait till the morning.
Toodles.
Oh!
No, it's all right. lt's all right.
Beddy bye-bye.
Whoops... Oh!
Mrs. Warren...
Let me assist you.
Very kind.
Ooop... ooop... oop!
Aaah!
Whoops!
What's going on here?
Now, Katherine, are you going to believe what you see... or what l tell you?
Oh!
Uh, Mrs. McLintock, hope you won't misunderstand. lt's the first hundred women sitting on his lap... that l misunderstood.
Number 101 is quite simple.
Now, G.W. McLintock, l have something...
He's gone to sleep.
Just when l know exactly what l want to say to him, he goes to sleep. l waited up to talk to Mr. McLintock. l wanted to tell him l was quitting.
You see, Sheriff Lord has asked me to marry him, and...
Oh, oh, congratulations! l don't want to seem prudish, but if you are going to marry
Sheriff Lord, it seems to me that you're sitting on the wrong man's lap.
Oh!
Come on, l'll help you upstairs, and we'll have a long talk about men in general.
Ladies!
One moment.
Ooh... Oh!
Watch out!
You'll get us all killed.
Whoops!
Wait a minute, ladies, till l catch my breath, then l'll get you up those stairs, as sure as my name is
George Washington McLintoooock.
Unh!
KATE: You may be quitting,
Mrs. Wallace...
Mrs. Warren.
KATE: But not tomorrow. l want my breakfast in bed. l want...
MRS. WARREN: l know.
Toast, lightly browned...
Somebody sure put a knob on my skull.
DRAGO: lt was Katie.
G. W: Katie? Why?
DRAGO: Mrs. Warren was there...
Ooh...
And there you was, there...
Ooh!
And there the whiskey bottle was, there.
Oh.
And Katie's temper being what
Katie's temper is, well...
There you are.
Drago, old friend, my wife does not understand me.
DRAGO: Why should she be any different than any other?
Come on, l got to get you up the stairs.
Get you ready for that big celebration tomorrow.
Watch it!
Oh!
Drago... l am sleeping in the den.
Hooligans!
Ain't got no respect for your elders.
Bunny lost his temper!
Bunny lost his temper!
Bunny lost his temper!
Scallywags! Little imps! l hope you get the measles!
MAN: Oop! Oh, ooh!
Whoah!
G. W: Come on, get him aboard. ls everybody ready?
MAN: Uh, number five needs a flank cinch.
G. W: Get him one.
Let us know when you're ready.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen... lt is my honor to present to you the governor of our territory,
Cuthbert H. Humphreys.
GOVERNOR: Thank you, Mayor.
My friends and citizens of this great territory, this is the ninth consecutive year... it has been my privilege and my pleasure... to inaugurate the McLintock
Fourth of July celebration.
Now, the first event will be the wild horse race.
But before l fire the shot to start the event, l would like to say a few modest words... regarding my stewardship of this great territory.
Ride it, Ben!
Crush him! Crush him!
Whoo-hoo!
All right, Professor Birnbaum.
Gentlemen.
Sheriff, here's your horse.
DRAGO: Come on, get them all lined up.
Come here, Ching.
Now, boys, you all know the rules. lt's twice around the inside and once around the outside.
First cowboy that hits that finish line... without busting that egg is a winner.
And l caution you boys about some of them eggs,
'cause some of them eggs are last year's holdovers.
DRAGO: All right, mount up.
Katherine, my dear, you seem to be enjoying yourself.
Oh, yes.
This is wonderful. lt's is the only thing l really do enjoy... about this barbaric country: the Fourth of July celebration.
Well, Katherine, l've been here for three days. l haven't heard from you. ls anything wrong?
Wrong?
Well, l just hope that it hasn't been necessary... for you to say anything to G.W.
What are you talking about?
Well, Katherine, you see, l'm in a rather delicate position, being governor of the territory and all. l just hope you haven't found it necessary... to say anything about...
About... what?
About you and me.
Why, you pompous windbag.
Do you think that you're the only man... who's ever tried to play pattyfingers with me?
Who's ever tried to lure me into the moonlight?
Well, no, but l...
Well, l'm a big girl, and l can take care of myself.
My husband knows it. l can assure you, Governor, that your reputation is untarnished.
Now get out of my way.
Folks, we got ourselves a winner.
Curly Fletcher!
JAKE: Mazel tov, Curly!
DRAGO: Give me the egg.
Disqualified!
Here you go, Curly.
G.W., G.W., you'll never believe what happened over there.
What?
You smell of beer.
Well, naturally. l'm drinking beer.
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen, the next event will be a contest... between the two bronco-busting champions of our territory.
You remember the year l rode in that event?
Wore your garters to hold up my sleeves?
Shhh!
We had a bet, and l won it.
George Washington McLintock, you are a very crude man.
Well, l guess so, but that was a rough horse.
Like to jarred my insides loose.
But it was worth it.
Oh!
Free beers!
JAKE: One... two... three...
Go!
Hey, keep a tight rope!
Come on, Dev!
Pull him, pull him!
Dev, Dev, are you all right? l guess so.
Nothing busted but my pride.
Well, that ought to even things up, farmer.
For what?
For that sore nose you gave me the other day.
DRAGO: Well, that ain't what's sore on him. lt's the cow pony race.
The finish line is at the barbecue.
So, start meandering.
DRAGO: Come on!
Now, what is that?
False courage?
Why, you know a Douglas doesn't ever use a thing like that. l want you to get on that horse, get out in front and stay out in front. l'll be out in front, Dad, all the way.
Aw, good boy.
Now, remember, stay out in front.
That Agamemnon's a good horse.
Whoah, Agamemnon.
MAN: 11:40, and she's on time.
Whoah!
Whoah!
Agamemnon!
Come on, boy, whoah!
Oh, McLin.
Big party.
Where's your whiskey?
Whose idea was this stunt?
Duck, doggone it, them are real bullets.
Oh. Oh!
Uh!
BUNNY: Reckon that's about all the excitement you'd want... for one Fourth of July, eh?
DRAGO:
Old Puma finally got his way.
But l reckon he's riding out his last war party.
G. W:
Well, he won't get very far.
JAKE: But one thing still has me puzzled.
Where did they get the guns?
G. W: l was wondering the same thing.
BUNNY:
My kidney's been bothering me...
G. W: Bunny...
G.W.! Psst! Pssst!
What an idiotic joke!
Joke! Do you think that was a joke?
Well, shut up!
Do you want everybody in town to see me?
You look good in feathers.
Oh!
BECKY: Dev, l think they've gone.
DEV: Yeah!
What are you going to do about it?
What can l do?
Nothing!
Just like you've always done!
Oh!
How long, G.W.?
How long, what?
Katherine.
DRAGO: She's been riding herd on you for two years now.
JAKE: l'm a peaceable man, but my father used to say,
"You raise your voice, it doesn't do any good,"
"it's time to raise your hand."
Well, l've been planning to do something about it. l'll, uh... l'll have another talk with her.
JAKE: Talk to her?
Talk to her!
Talking won't do any good.
Becky, have you seen your m...
What's been happening around here?
You've got hay all over you.
Been some mighty sneaky goings-on here during that raid,
Mr. McLintock.
Who was it said only a trollop would kiss a man... before they were formally engaged?
Oh, but we are engaged, sir.
- You are?
- That is, with your permission.
Well, you've got it.
Oh, Mrs. Warren? l think it's wonderful. l guess this is the only engagement... that ever started off of a spanking.
DRAGO: Mm-hmm, l reckon Birnbaum was right.
All right.
Lord bless us, this is gonna be a great day.
Doggone it, folks, let's don't let a little old lndian raid... break up a good barbecue and a rodeo.
The meat's on!
You contestants get ready for the cow pony race.
Who is it?
G. W: lt's me.
Let me in.
Not now.
Right now!
KATE: Are you insane?
G. W: l want to talk to you.
KATE: lt'll have to wait.
Oh, G.W.!
G. W: l've taken all l'm going to take from you.
KATE: You are insane.
You are going to tell me why you packed up, picked up, and walked out on me.
Two years ago... you remember... you came home from Denver... with lipstick all over your...
Aaah!
Lipstick on my collar.
KATE: And l've got the shirt to prove it.
G. W: Who cares!
Why, you big...
Ah!
GOVERNOR: Katherine!
Oh!
G.W., you are a ruffian.
Cuthbert, you are right.
Well, what kind of a family is that?
The best!
And dangerous, fella.
AGARD: Well, what happened?
Who won the race?
MAN: Who cares, Agard?
History's being made.
Yes, Rufus? l regret to inform you l've changed my mind about matrimony.
Rufus!
MAN: Hey! Mrs. McLintock!
Kath...
Katherine!
G. W:
Keep them out of here.
Oh!
Looks like G.W.'s buying out the whole store. l'm afraid you're right.
Crummy family! Crummy family!
G.W.!
KATE: Oh, G.W., G.W.!
Oh, oh, G.W., G.W.
Aah!
Oh, Mrs. McLintock, you're all wet!
Am l? Try it!
Wrong woman, G.W.
Oh, pardon me.
Mrs. McLintock, you setting a new style?
Uh!
Shhh!
Mr. McLintock! ln here!
Oh! lf l ever get through this humiliation, you will rue the day you ever met me!
Oh, bellyache and fight all you want. lt won't do you any good.
You've been digging those burrs into me for two years.
Now, you're going to get your comeuppance.
Thanks.
My father would be proud of you!
Then l'll make him prouder.
Stop it! Aah!
G. W: Keep it.
You may need it.
Now get your divorce.
Oh!
Oooh!
Home!
Don't spare the horse.
- Home? Are you...
- You heard me.
KATE: Don't think you're going to get rid of me that easy.
Yah!
G. W: No more living in the capital?
KATE: No.
G. W: No more Newport in season?
KATE: Nope.
G. W: No more dancing at the Governor's Ball?
KATE: No, G.W.
G. W: Happy days!
KATE: 310 times, without a miss.
That's a record.
The civil war was over but one infamous band of guerrillas fought on, Quantrell's Raiders.
They had already written one of the bloodiest pages in history... by their savage raid of hate on Lawrence, Kansas.
Wherever they rode they left a trail of murder and destruction, pillaging, killing wantonly.
Their leader, a man wanted dead or alive by both, the north and south, Quantrell.
The men who followed this master of surprise attack were a strange mixture, outlaws... gunfighters, confederate soldiers displaced in the bitter aftermath... of the war between the States.
No sign of cavalry ahead
Colonel, I suggest we post a rear guard.
- Brady, detail two men.
- Yes sir.
You find a place to rest this horses after the raid?
Willie scouted that.
Yes sir, I found a deserted farm west of town, it's hidden back of the road.
We'll take half the men and attack the town from the north.
- I'll lead them sir.
- No, you won't, you stay with me.
Clint will handle that detail.
All right, you men, follow me.
Their mission, obtain guns, provisions and money.
Their orders, shoot without warning.
Their objective, a quiet, unsuspecting little town.
I want every gun in town pile right here in the street.
That's Quantrell, that's Quantrell.
Hey man, will let them keep the change.
Look out.
All right men, let's get out of here.
You got exactly a half-hour, to feed and water the horses.
- Post lookouts at both ends of the barn.
- Yes sir.
Hard on the raiders' heels was the man... ordered by the army to end the guerilla's reign of terror, Captain Tom Andrews.
For 30 days he had followed the bloody trail left by Quantrell.
But it always been too late to stop the senseless slaughter.'
Now, once again the trail led to the north.
Forward.
I got to talk to you, please.
It's the old Carson place, nobody lives there.
Now, you take it easy son.
- I was hunting rabbits...
- Now you just take it easy, what you see?
- They went in the barn.
- Who? Who went the barn?
- A whole lot of them and they all had guns.
- Where is this Carson place?
- Way back off the road.
- Good boy.
- That ought to hold you Colonel.
- Yeah, that'll do Clint.
Call the boys together.
All right men, line up.
Montana, step out.
I said step out.
- What is this, court martial?
- You could call it that.
Not a sound out of you.
We're moving on but you're not going with us.
What am I supposed to be guilty of?
You saw that sniper, you're responsible for this.
Now, wait a minute colonel.
If you're wrong, you're going to lose one of the best men you got.
I'm not wrong Brady.
Now, in a regular trial, at least you ought to have a witness.
- He's got one.
- You're a liar.
No, I'm not, Montana.
You've been wanting to take over this command for a long time.
Now, I'll take your gun.
Quantrell, you're surrounded.
There'll be time enough for this later, get your rifles.
You don't stand a chance in hell, throw out those guns.
Blue-coats.
Let's see those guns, I'm not bluffing.
Fire a volley.
Clint, you and Willie get those rifles we took today, throw them out, we need time.
You two, up in the hayloft and cover it.
Quantrell, let's see those guns.
I'll take half you men out the front.
Brady, you take the rest out the back.
- Yes sir.
- Let's all get mounted.
Quantrell, I'm going to give you till the count of five.
One, two, three... four...
Come on, get on your horse, let's get out of here.
Not until the old man clear out, but I'll open the doors for you.
Good luck Brady.
All right... now come on out, one at a time, with your hands up.
Let's have it.
You could've gotten away Willie.
Yeah, now we both could hadn't been for that Montana.
I should've killed him when I had the chance.
While Quantrell lay gravely wounded in a military hospital... the raiders that were captured stood trial in this courtroom.
Everybody rise.
Be seated.
Clint Stewart, William Martin, you have both been found guilty as charge.
At this time, sentence will be passed upon you.
- Your honor...
- Yes Captain Andrews?
Your honor I'd like to speak on behalf of these two men.
You the were chief witness for the prosecution.
That's right Your Honor.
But these two are different than the others you sent to prison.
In what way? They both rode with Quantrell.
Yes sir, but they didn't join the raiders until after the war.
They didn't take part in the Lawrence massacre.
Why wasn't this testimony given at the trial?
I, I didn't find out about it until this morning sir.
What difference does it make anyway?
This is a northern court, we'll get northern justice.
When you joined Quantrell, you knew his reputation.
We had no choice, they wouldn't give a confederate a job.
Stinking carpetbaggers took over the whole south.
You got to admit sir, there wasn't much for them to come home to.
And when I went home to, rock chimney and a pile of ashes.
The men that rode with Quantrell in the
Lawrence raid were given life sentences... but because Captain Andrews has come to your defense... and because of the war and the confusion it left in men's minds...
20 years of hard labor.
This court is adjourned.
I'm sorry, I did my best.
Thanks for nothing.
- How do you know so much about us?
- Got a letter from his brother.
- Where is he?
- Hospital in Atlanta, wounded in action.
He's going to be all right, this is for you.
He read about the trial and decided to write me about you two.
And your fine war records.
Well, nobody cares much if you're on the losing side.
I respect a good soldier no matter what the color of his uniform.
All right, move along.
I'll write your brother where he can get in touch with you.
The kid would be better off if he forget he ever had me for a brother.
Thanks anyway.
Match this.
I'll call you and I'll raise.
All right, I call.
Sorry mister, I got a pretty good hand.
Full house.
Wait a minute, I got a better one.
I've been looking all over west Texas for you.
Glad you found me tonight Brady.
All right, everybody out, out.
- Brady, good to see you.
- Where have you been?
Oh, I've been hiding out, doing a little penny-ante work till my arm healed up.
How is it now?
Faster than ever been.
Good, good, we'll find a better way to use your talent than this.
With you any time Brady, here.
You know, I ain't forgot how you stood up for me with Quantrell.
Quantrell dropped those charges, he's dead.
Died in a military hospital about a week ago.
Well, I hate to see any man go that way, even Quantrell.
Wonder how many of the boys got away when we broke out that barn.
Well, I think that the better part of the best of them got out.
I can't see what you're getting at.
The way I look at it, you're the natural heir to the gang.
The boys would be eager to follow that gun of yours.
Brady, you got a head on your shoulders.
I'll put together a better gang than Quantrell ever had.
Let's drink to it.
As soon as we get the boys together... we'll shake this Texas dust off our heels and light out for Arizona.
- Brady, what's in Arizona we'd want?
- Gold, lots of it.
Every gold train on the way out of the mint in Washington passes right through Arizona.
- And no Texas Rangers around to stop us?
- No.
Again they rode, the men of Quantrell.
These man rode only for greed.
Defying what law there was, ravaging a territory helpless to stop them.
Helpless until the night of June 17th 1866... when Capt Tom Andrews, late of the US army, rode into Tombstone for a secret rendezvous.
- I'm here to see the governor.
- Tom, come on in.
Good to see you Tom, I wasn't expecting you for a day or so.
- I'm sorry to interrupt your supper sir.
- Just finished, sit down.
Your letter said urgent.
I left the day I was discharged from the army.
Good, we need a man out here who gets things done.
And I think you're going to need more than that.
- You've read the papers?
- Is it as bad as it sounds?
Worse, four banks held up, six gold trains captured, all in the last six months.
- And no one knows yet who the outlaws are.
- And I can make a pretty good guess.
That's what I was hoping.
I've been studying the way they operate, same military pattern that Quantrell used.
- But you wiped out Quantrell.
- Quantrell yes but some of his men got away.
We don't have enough lawmen out here to fight that kind of bunch.
Only last week, the raiders challenged a posse to an open fight.
- I can imagine what happened.
- Posse was wiped out to a man.
We must organize like they did in Texas.
You mean the rangers?
We've got to organize our own territorial police force.
I want you to head it up.
It'll take time to get a good bunch of lawmen together.
We don't have time.
If those raiders aren't stopped soon, they're going to take over the entire territory.
I don't know.
Trying to fight the outlaws and organize a troop of rangers at the same time...
- I doubt I could pull it out.
- I never heard you say that about anything.
I tell you what, there's just one way, one that we might be able to stop that gang...
- but you won't like what I want to do.
- You let me decide that.
You better order some more coffee... because if this thing backfires, it could cost you the governorship. Waiter.
The governor agreed to the most unusual request.
Two weeks later a cargo of hard-work convicts under heavy guard... were transferred from a Texas prison to the jurisdiction of the territory of Arizona... purpose unknown.
Pull up over there.
- You all right Willie?
- I've felt better.
Why do you suppose they're transferring us to Umo prison?
Who cares? It couldn't be worse than the one we were in.
I don't know, I hear that
Umo is the hellhole of creation.
All right, get out and stretch.
The first one that makes a wrong move, we'll bury him out here.
Going anywhere Willie?
Yeah, I hadn't made plans, no. It's good to get out of that torture chamber though.
Martin, Stewart, move out.
- What the hell is this?
- We need firewood, you're elected.
You've been chousing us around ever since you took over this expedition.
- When I say move out, move.
- I think the man means it.
Was better natured when he was wearing that blue uniform.
Let's go, over there.
I'll tell you when to pick it up.
We need big stuff, on down there.
Hold it.
Sit down boys, take it easy.
Take it easy?
Now, that's a switch.
You've been out in the desert sun too long Captain?
Prison life isn't exactly the best way to spend your days, is it?
Well, I had had it easier.
Why don't you stop stalling?
Something on your mind besides our health?
This the badge of the Arizona Rangers.
I'm going to make it something a man will be proud to wear.
Well, bully for you. Why you telling us?
Because I want you and Willie to join me.
Jo...?
Now let's see, just let me get this straight.
First you put us in, now you're going to let us out.
There's got to be an awful big catch to this.
There is.
You got to help us round up the outlaws working Arizona.
Then you get an unconditional pardon.
Now, wait a minute, what made you pick us?
Because you're the only ones that can handle this job.
I see, you understand Willie?
Two men who rode with Quantrell.
Exactly, so are the ones we're after.
- Hear Montana Smith heads that outfit.
- It's my guess.
You take these bracelets off of us... what makes you sure we won't head for Mexico and never come back?
No, I'm not sure of anything, I'm willing to risk it.
It's your gamble but our hand say the odds are against you.
It's the kind of odds I like.
Now... you'll get horses from the guards... and then you, you better take me with you away.
- Are the guards in on this?
- You're on your own.
With an empty gun.
Come on.
All right boys, you can drop those rifles
Do what I tell, get up here, hurry.
You better do as he says.
How about it Willie? We fought together, let's escape together.
- Give us a break, will you pals?
- Please?
Come on Willie, throw me a gun.
I'm taking you with me.
Hey, what about us?
Take us with you.
Hey, Clint, take us with you.
Sorry friend, you just slow us down.
Get on that horse.
Where I'll find Montana?
That'll be part of your job.
Right now you'll need supplies and some different clothes.
I'll be glad enough to shed these.
It's a water hole up that drum.
One of my men will meet you there, be a lot of help.
Wait with him, I'll get back to you with further instructions.
You Captain Andrews' man?
Right.
Ranger Danny Bonner, make yourself at home, I'll be right there.
You really can go for this ranger stuff?
Well, I want out of prison and I want Montana.
- And then what?
- We'll see.
Danny?
Clint, you didn't expect see your kid brother out here, did you? Hello Roy.
Danny, you've grown a foot since I saw you last.
Now, you two look like you could use a cup of coffee, come on.
Hey, what's all this Bonner business?
What's wrong with your real name?
Explained all that in my letter.
They don't deliver any letters at that prison.
You were ashamed of being my brother, weren't you? Can't say as I blame you.
No Clint, I was never ashamed of you.
Only reason I changed my name was... because I was afraid they wouldn't let me join the rangers if they...
- If they knew about me.
- I've always been proud of you Clint.
Look, I've carried this with me ever since you sent it home from Shiloh.
Symbol of a lost cause.
Now you're now with the rangers,
I'll tell everybody we're brothers.
- No, Danny, don't do that.
- Why not? The Captain already knows about.
Let us just let it ride along the way it is for the time being.
Anything you say Clint, let me get you some more coffee.
Of course you heard about Mother and Dad?
It's the reason I never went home after I got out of the hospital.
You ever find out who killed them?
Carpetbaggers, burned the house down with the folks trapped inside in.
If only I'd gone home a week earlier, I maybe I could...
I was with him Danny.
When we heard that
Quantrell was killing carpetbaggers... we didn't care what else he did.
I see now why you joined the raiders, I wish I'd been with you.
I'm glad you weren't Danny.
You know, I have a lot of respect for Cap.
Andrews, teaming you two up together.
Well, I think
I'll use your bathtub here Danny.
See the way they're dressed?
It's a Yaqui tribe all right.
- Wonder how friendly they are.
- Hombres, muchos hombres.
They must be part civilized, at least they got a church.
Oh yeah, yeah.
Well, it be a good place to hole up till the gold shipment comes through.
- Who's in charge around here?
- My father, Chief Ortega.
Chief, I want to make a little deal with you.
- He does not speak your language.
- That's got to be a big help.
I will translate for you.
All right.
You tell your daddy here that, we going to stay here for a while.
My father say there is no food, no room for so many.
It is true señor, there's barely enough food for these people to feed themselves.
I'll say a prayer for them, got everything we need right here.
My father say you can't stay here.
Well now, you tell your pappy we're going to stay here whether he likes it or not.
Well, go on, tell him.
Now, let's give it to the old man.
No, as long as we got a gun at the chief's head his people won't give us any trouble.
Maybe you're right.
Let's get them into the church, come on, let's go.
Come on, move.
Everybody but you, honey.
We going to keep you around for a while to maybe, maybe do the cooking, eh Brady?
Might be a long wait.
All right, keep an eye on them.
All right men, search all the huts.
Make sure you got all of them.
- That's some shooting, eh Danny?
- Not too bad.
A trifle slow maybe.
I admit I'm a little rusty but if you going to be so critical, let's see what you can do.
- You better get ready.
- I'm ready, let's have it.
Hey, that's not bad, for a kid.
Let's have it.
I've never seen anything quite like that before, let's see it again Willie.
Lucky fluke, you know something, kid is getting too big for his britches.
Where did you learn to shoot like that?
Well, I copy Clint's style... that is, the style he had before he slowed down.
Hey, watch it ranger.
- Hi Captain.
- Hi Danny.
About time you got here.
You're no more anxious to get moving than I am.
I spread word about your escape.
Montana won't be surprise when you show up.
Well, tell me where I can find him.
There is, they were last seen near the town of Panal.
- It'll be a good place to start.
- I'll get the horses.
Give you a hand.
As soon as you locate that gang I want you to join up with them but be careful.
When you find out when and where they plan to make they're next strike... get word to me in Panal.
You placing a lot of trust in me captain.
Well, I figured you had a pretty good taste of what is like on the other side of the law.
That's right.
What if we decided to tip off that gang and hightail it for the border?
In that case, I'd order the best man in my outfit to hunt you down... and shoot, to kill.
Danny?
That could pose a problem.
Before you leave, I'll have to swear you into the rangers, raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to render loyal service to the territory of Arizona?
I do.
- I do.
- Good luck.
So long Clint.
Goodbye Danny.
Do not stay here, señor.
You don't exactly make a customer feel welcome.
You are one of the men who escaped, I see your poster this morning.
- You keep your eyes open, don't you?
- Sometimes it pays.
I've been looking for some friends of mine, they've been working round here.
They might be in an
Indian village, south, near the border.
Think we may be onto something.
Down there, should be round the bend any minute.
Are sure they're loaded with gold?
Well, that's the big one we've been waiting for.
At the rate they're moving... they should be exactly where we want them by tomorrow morning.
Should we better go back and report to Montana?
He'll go along with what we aim to do.
This place looks deserted, you think that girl was pulling your leg?
I don't know.
We can sure find out.
Meet me at the church.
Look here honey, look what I just found.
- Hello Eddie.
- Willy?
Keep it just quiet, eh?
- Good old Montana.
- What the devil is going on?
Clint just wants to spend about 20 seconds with your boss, that's all.
Yeah, I knew he'd be back before long.
What is this? Sure ain't whiskey.
- Forbidden drink.
- Well, not for me it ain't.
What do they call this stuff honey?
Peyote, devil curse.
- Yeah, I heard about it, that's good stuff.
- No, make men crazy.
Want kill.
You know, I heard tell how it, makes women a little wild too.
Now we just try a little bit and see what it does for you.
- Come on, come on a little bit.
- No.
- A little bit.
- No.
Ah sure, do bring out the devil in you, don't it?
Why don't we try a little more, eh honey?
How about me?
I've been expecting you Clint.
Well, I'm here.
Oh, then why don't you forget what happened? You can ride with us again.
Sure, till my back is turned.
The cross, the cross.
- Thanks for the warning.
- Señor, will you help me?
How?
My mother and father are being held in the church.
Where the rest of your people?
Hiding in the hills, or dead.
Two weeks ago... he and his men come into our village to kill, to...
- Well, you see how he treat me.
- Yes.
Señor please, we must hurry.
- Put those guns away.
- You first Brady.
- What chance do you got against all of us?
- This much.
What do we got to fight about? Lost one and gained two.
When I heard you broke loose, I know you had you sting out for Montana.
You got a grudge against any of the rest of us?
No, that's it.
Good, I don't imagine they serve any whiskey where you've been.
How about a drink?
Why not?
I'd appreciate it if you got back to your cooking.
The boys will be wanting something to eat before long, come on, get it.
Come on, let's have a drink.
Stolen from one of the best hotels in Arizona.
Well, they sure didn't give this kind of stuff to us prisoners.
Tell me, wasn't Captain Andrews guarding those prison wagons when you made your break?
That's right, he's head of the Arizona Rangers now.
And why you let him go, why didn't you kill him?
Then they would had all their dogs out after us.
Yeah,
- I guess you're right.
- Who cares about a couple of ex-prisoners?
- But if we killed the head of the rangers?
- Somebody ought to get him.
They will.
What do you think of our cook?
I think you better watch her or she's likely to poison you.
Why don't you let her go?
She'll treat us all right, as long as we've got a gun on the chief.
We don't have to chance her cooking much longer.
There's enough gold coming through here to care of all of us for life.
And that's what we've been waiting for and then we're heading for the promised land...
Mexico.
Maybe we'll see you there.
How come?
I won't take a chance on going back where you can't get this, we're heading out.
Why don't you stay? We could use you Clint.
No thanks, some other time.
Mexico is just beyond that mountain range, isn't it?
Yeah, I scouted them real good, the best pass is right through there.
Thanks for the whiskey.
Thanks.
You had to open your fat mouth.
Did it ever occur to you they might try to beat us to that gold train?
I thought they were going to be riding with us.
Now, you and Matt follow them, make good and sure they really are heading for Mexico.
Now go on, get.
Clint...
- you really planning on going to Mexico?
- I sure am.
Oh, what about the captain and your brother?
What about them?
You were using them, you never intended to keep your promise.
It's the promise I made to myself that counts with me.
I kept that one, coming?
Hi Clint, how you make out?
- We made out.
- Now, why don't you just tell him?
Tell me what?
Captain sent you to keep an eye on us, eh?
He doesn't have the faith in you I have.
Well, I guess you know this trail leads to Mexico.
I, I figured you might be circling back to town so...
- in case somebody...
- No good Danny.
I wasn't cut out to be a lawman.
Why don't you go on back and tell the Captain I resigned?
You can't do that Clint.
Sorry Danny, sorry it has to be this way.
Stay right where you are, don't turn around.
You're under arrest Clint.
I took an oath, just like you did.
Maybe it didn't mean anything to you but it does to me.
You with him or me?
Reckon I'll have to string along with the kid here Clint.
How come a kid like that ever get a gun on those two?
I don't know.
Bring my horse Willie.
- We got a long ride back to the captain.
- Easy Dan.
Got to talk to you, I got to convince you.
You just lie back there and take it easy.
Clint, I don't have much time and
I got to talk some sense into you.
- You've already talked some sense into me.
- You mean it?
You seeing things the right way?
Yes Danny, I'm seeing things the right way.
I knew you wouldn't run out on me, I knew it all along.
Clint, it's getting kind of dark.
No, it's a little cloudy Danny.
Clint, I can't see it.
It's Matt and Duke.
Well, looks like
I get you two out of trouble.
- Oh, I'll be damned, a ranger.
- And you're looking at two more.
I ain't going to draw against you Clint.
I ain't going to draw against you.
See? I'm taking my gun belt off.
Let them have him Willie.
Well, which is it? Are we going to Mexico or heading on back?
You know the answer to that.
Now we're going to have to work fast, Brady will miss those two.
What is it Matt?
Martina, come over here.
See if you can do something for him.
Practice torture.
And you have driven them back to this.
If you do not go... it will be for all of you.
- That's Matt.
- Too late to back out now.
Changed your mind?
Yeah, one taste of those Indians and we suddenly got gold fever.
How is he?
The Yaqui are good at this sort of torture, he's dead.
- You know anything about this?
- Only the Indians were chasing him and Duke.
We tried to help but they killed Duke and carried him off before we could.
And you fellas came through without a scratch.
Thanks to his shooting, he got four of those Yaqui before they got away.
- How about it, still use us?
- We need every man we can get.
You'll find grain for your horses around back.
Sure it doesn't make sense,
Duke and Matt running from those Indians.
The Yaquis don't have any guns.
Our boys were carrying rifles.
Why didn't they stop and fight them off?
I don't know.
Everybody is oiling their guns... looks like they're getting ready to pull out in the morning.
Do you think Brady fell for that story we told him about the Indian fight?
Not too much.
- That means they'll be out looking for Duke.
- They won't bother.
They're bound to be getting ready hit that gold train in the morning.
That's all it could be.
- We better get word to Captain Andrews.
- That'll be you,
I'll stay behind and cover for you.
What, what're you going to tell them when they miss me?
If you'd get back here before daylight, they won't miss you.
Suppose I don't?
I'll think of something.
I'll tell them you decided to take that little trip to Mexico after all.
- You think they'll believe you?
- It's about a 50-50 chance.
Señor, I must talk with you.
But, why don't you run away from here? You can get away.
- I cannot leave my mother and father.
- You can't do anything to help them.
I can pray.
I suppose that won't hurt.
How you learn to speak English?
The padre, before they kill him, he teach me to speak English and...
They killed the padre?
Yes, just as he was teaching my people a new way of life.
Like torturing that man we let the Yaquis capture this morning?
No, that was the old way.
The way of the savage Yaqui.
They were driven out of Mexico to wander through the desert.
Señor, my husband and my children were killed on that flight from Mexico.
- I'm sorry.
- I want the new way of life for my people.
The way the padre was teaching.
To build, to plant things, to live in peace.
- Why are you telling me this?
- I trust you.
You've no reason to.
Are not rangers supposed to be good men?
- What do you know about the rangers?
- I just come from my people out there.
They give me this.
Danny's.
My people say you killed one of the outlaws and give them another...
- and still you come back.
- I came back because of this.
Señor...
- rangers are supposed to be good people.
- Yes.
- Then I hope many come.
- They will, he went after them.
Your friend, señor? He was followed and you are in great danger.
Willie made it to his horse, I saw him.
Si, but he was followed very close by four men.
He'll make it, he's got to.
You were in a bit of a hurry, where you going?
Mexico.
Wrong direction, Mexico is that way.
You were headed straight for town.
- I want to talk to you Brady.
- Talk.
- Alone.
- We all know what you want to say.
You mean about being a ranger?
I had to join to them to get out of the prison... you got to be able to figure that out.
And Willie took off last night just for a moonlight ride.
Told me he's going to Mexico.
Guess his conscience get to bothering him.
When it's come to a choice between cash or conscience, well, I'll take the cash.
Bring him out.
He wasn't heading for Mexico.
He was going to report to Captain Andrews.
Well boys, we got a couple of rangers crawled in with us.
What do you do with a pair of rattlers?
Dirty double-crosser.
You took an oath, the same as I did.
You hear that? He took an oath.
You're no ranger.
Now, you listen to me Willie... get this ranger nonsense out of your head and come on and ride with us.
I made a promise and it means something to me.
- We all make promises.
- I keep mine.
Well, what shall we do with them?
Give me some time with him.
Maybe can talk some sense into his head, make him forget that oath.
I'm afraid we couldn't trust him.
Then lock him in the church over there... we'll be long gone by the time he gets out of there.
I've got a better idea.
With all that gold at stake, we couldn't take any chances.
You two were good friends once but he sure turned on you, didn't he?
Yeah, he sure did.
I'll give it to you, when I think you need it.
Get your horse.
All right, mount up.
Must be a million bucks in gold on those pack-horses.
And at least 20 soldiers guarding it, maybe more.
Not much chance of surprising them, not out here anyway.
Who said we going to hit them out here?
We'll wait until they get into town.
That's logical.
As soon as the soldiers clear, we stampede the pack train out of town.
Want me to do that?
That's where Willie was heading last night.
You stay here and pick up any strays.
You don't trust me, eh?
No, I trust you all right.
Jim, you and Eddie stay here with Clint.
Sure thing boss.
Well Captain, looks like the gold got through this far all right.
But that doesn't mean the gang hasn't been watching it.
- Maybe they'll hit it between here and Bixby.
- But they never work that territory.
That could change.
It's strange one of those three didn't contact me.
When that gold train leaves here tomorrow, we'll be with it.
If any of those pack-horses are loose, pick them up.
And he almost had me convinced.
I'll take a couple of men and go after him.
No, no.
We'll be across the border before he cause any trouble.
All right, moving out.
- I was about to give up on you.
- I don't blame you.
- Danny and Willie?
- Both dead.
- I'm sorry.
- I need a gun.
Going to take us a while to pick up their trail.
- I'll take you straight to them.
- Good, moving out.
They'll be in Mexico before we catch up with them.
Not unless those Indians let me down.
- We never get the horses through that.
- Well, let's cut a pass.
Jim, take half the men back up the canyon, hold off the posse.
All right, we haven't got much time, let's clear a path with the stuff.
Come Diablo, come on.
Watch out for that cactus.
Right, keep it moving.
Willie?
One last favor, señor.
Will you tell the church to send us a padre soon?
First chance I get.
Thank you, I've been well trained.
I'll be a good nun.
I'm sure you will.
- Goodbye, Martina.
- Goodbye.
Shoo, now! Shoo!
Ain't you got no better manners than to eat at the top of a house?
You, Guipago!
You!
Rachel!
What day is today?
Tuesday, I think, Mama. I'm not sure.
Butter tastes kind of wild to me.
Must be the green in springtime grass.
- Guipago!
- Rachel!
- Guipago!
- Rachel, the bread!
Rachel, the bread! Tuesday's bread day!
You gotta make the bread!
You ain't friends with me yet, are you?
Well, neither am I.
Guipago... grey-haired old grass-eater.
You're only half-horse, you know that?
The other half is mean old Kiowa Indian.
Yeah.
Rachel, honey, you'll break your neck!
Both of you!
Whoa.
You ain't gonna let no skein of geese scare you?
They're only human.
Just fly a little higher than us folk, that's all.
Giddup, Guipago.
Howdy, mister.
We got food down to the soddy, if you care to partake.
- What's your name, girl?
- Rachel.
- Rachel what?
- Why, Rachel Zachary.
You're no Zachary.
Not a Zachary born, but Ma says it's no different than if I were flesh and blood.
How do you know who I am?
I never seen you before.
I am the sword of God.
The fire and the vengeance, whereby the wrong shall be righted and the truth be told.
Well, I declare!
Just what did he look like, Rachel?
Like something blowed in by the wind.
He had a sabre.
- Who is he, Mama?
- I don't know.
Some crazy old hunter, I suppose.
But he knows us. Or about us - me being a foundling and all.
Nothing so wonderful about that.
Everybody in Texas knew your ma and pa.
Or heard about them, anyway.
- But the way that he talked...
- Prairie fever.
- What's that?
- The worst thing you can get.
Loneliness. I was touched by it myself once or twice.
If it wasn't I had a daughter to talk to...
Go in the root cellar and get me some carrots and potatoes for the stew.
You!
How do, Miz Zachary?
I'd have come sooner, but I had a long way to ride. Seven years.
You can't kill me.
The god of vengeance will blind your eye.
Death for death and blood for blood.
Mama?
Mama, who you talking to?
Git! How many times must I tell you to get off my house?
Sorry-looking carrots.
Mama, what's the matter?
You got tears in your eyes.
No, I ain't.
I don't feel much like cooking with no men in the house.
And your brother Ben away so long.
I wish Ben were here right now.
Right now!
It's a long ride to Wichita.
And even longer back.
I can't wait, Mama. I just can't.
Look at your bread.
It's rising just beautiful, Mama.
Take it out before it gets too beautiful to eat.
- Shall I take some out to the boys?
- No.
If those big lumps Cash and Andy want fresh bread, let 'em ride home for it.
- 25, 26, 27. Which counts up to 81 so far!
- All we need is 150.
If I don't have them when Ben arrives,
I'll strap a saddle to my back.
Ben promised to take me on the drive to Wichita and show me how to live.
You got a way to go.
You ain't even shaved yet.
Ben says they have girls there which only have first names.
Ben says...
That'll be brother Ben.
- I see you made it.
- Looks that way.
- How's Ma and Rachel?
- Fine.
- How you doing?
- Pretty good, brother.
I don't know about pretty, but you didn't go to Wichita to be good.
Whoo! What's her name, Ben?
- Tell the truth, I don't recall.
- Don't recall?
By gee, if that ain't the way to live!
- Fine-looking bunch of riders.
- I hand-picked 'em.
- Off the barroom floor.
- They're sober now.
Boys, you can set down here.
No better shade within six miles.
The water is drinkable if you don't put nothin' in it.
Cash!
Cash!
The one with no whiskers, is he Injun or ain't he?
When I hire a man, I don't generally start out by insulting him.
What does he call himself?
- Johnny Portugal.
- They change their names.
All I know, he's the best horse-tamer in Texas.
If the wind's right,
I can smell Injun a mile off.
I hate to disappoint you, Cash.
That smell's comin' off of me.
I ain't changed my duds since Wichita.
- What did you pay for the fancy soap?
- One silver dollar.
Ain't nothing in Wichita less than one silver dollar.
Don't matter, though.
Beef at the railhead's 30 cents.
30 cents! We must have a million pounds out there with our brand on it.
For the first time we're gonna be rich!
- Ben.
- Rachel.
Ben!
Ben! Oh, Ben!
I'm so happy to see you! Oh, Ben!
Don't you cheat, you two.
Cash.
You can look now.
Well, what do you think?
I'm dreaming, ain't I? Ain't I, Ben?
- You must have paid a fortune.
- Not a red cent. Nothing at all.
I made a bet with a man
I could lift it off the floor by myself.
Cash. Andy.
Easy, now.
Must be getting weak.
Did that in Wichita with one finger.
Look here, Rachel. See how it opens.
You're playing the wrong end, daughter.
What makes you so happy, Mama?
Because you ain't sick or dead or scalped or something worse.
Nothing could kill me except lightning - and then it'd have to hit twice.
I believe that.
What tune is that, Mama?
Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
- Sounds like angels.
- What is it, Ma?
A pi-anna. Lord of mercy, a pi-anna!
Hallelujah, amen!
Ben Zachary must be counting on a golden year to buy a pi-anna.
- Giddy-up!
- Pa! I wanna change my dress!
- What's the matter with that one?
- Don't you want her to get married?
Take more than a fancy dress to catch a Zachary. Go ahead.
Papa! Papa!
Papa!
Give me that gun.
Papa!
- What's the matter, child?
- You snakebit?
- An old man.
- What old man?
He had only one eye and he wore a sabre.
A long sabre.
Get back in the wagon. Put your hat on.
I seen him and he sure seen me, cos he got that one eye full, Mama!
~ Down in the valley you hear the wind blow
~ Roses like sunshine, violets like dew
~ Angels in heaven know I love you
God love you, Ben, for staying partners with a man like me.
It's been a burden doing business with an honest, decent man.
- And crippled.
- Indian knife done that, Mattilda.
Indian squaw, Rachel, honey.
While he was tied captive by them Kiowa devils!
We licked 'em good last time.
Us and our picayune neighbours.
- Four years ago Christmas, down there.
- You flushed 'em and I shot 'em.
- Ain't showed a feather in four years!
- Four good years for buzzards!
Groundhog, blue potatoes and all the alkali salt you can eat!
Froze to the saddle!
A sunburn right through your clothes!
That twister two years ago, like a big black dog chasing his tail!
And the turnaround down in the spring, when the crick dried up and they all died!
Great God in the morning!
But now, this year, Mother, fat!
By the grace of God!
Fat as ever I've seen 'em in all my days!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We did it together, Ben.
Us Rawlins and you Zacharys.
What sayeth the Lord? The Lord sayeth
"Be fruitful and multiply. "
Multiply! We old folks done all the multiplying we can!
You say. Therefore, Ben, Mattilda,
I'd like to see our two families joined together.
- Keep talking, Papa.
- I don't mean you.
Not yet, anyway. Pull your dress down.
Who then, partner?
- He means me.
- You?
Charlie?
Charlie, come here.
Speak up, Charlie.
Tell my brother what you want.
Me?
- Nothing, sir.
- You're a liar, Charlie.
Yes, ma'am. I supposin' I am.
Tell him, Charlie, or I'll tell him.
Ben Zachary, sir,
I want to come courting.
- Courting who?
- Rachel.
My baby sister?
She's a pretty big baby.
And big enough, soon enough!
- Hush! You're getting drunk.
- Drunk! Drunk don't tell lies.
Well, Ben, what say you?
- I'll think on it.
- Huh! You'll think on it!
And that's all he'll ever do too, Papa.
The same goes with Cash Zachary.
I'm 20 years old and I've been waiting 20 years to get married!
Maybe you ain't asked the right Zachary.
- Do you love me, Andy?
- I do, except you're tearing my coat.
- Do you want to marry me, Andy?
- I'd like that just fine.
Except I promised myself
I'd go to Wichita first.
What in the world for?
Well, I ain't never in my life had... a glass of beer.
Oh. How long will that take, Andy?
- A month or two.
- I can't wait. I just can't.
I found a grey hair in my head this morning.
Cash, you know you love Georgia.
- Do I?
- He don't.
- Don't I?
- I don't want him. I hate him.
Come here, Georgia.
No, not in a million years.
I said come here.
Dust him good, Georgia.
Closer.
Georgia, you just spoiled the best chance you ever had of getting me married.
I hate you!
I'll kill him!
I'll kill all the men in the whole world!
Honey, pretty, you'd just be sorry tomorrow.
Honey, pretty, if you're that anxious to get married, there's an old man in the brush...
What old man? Georgia?
He didn't mention his name.
Mama, that's the old hunter.
The one I told you about.
What old hunter?
Mama, was anybody here?
Nobody, Cash. Nobody at all.
But, Mama, that crazy old man.
The one with the sabre.
Oh, him.
- Did you see him, Mama?
- Yes.
Many a time.
I've seen a hundred if I've seen one.
They all look alike to me. Lonely.
Lonely men are riding all over this country.
Buffalo hunters, only the buffalo's gone.
I feel sorry for 'em.
No home, no family.
Sorry for 'em, I tell you.
Yahoo!
Will you do something for me, Cash?
Stay home.
It's a dirty job. I'm coming along.
~ Glory, glory, hallelujah
~ Glory, glory, hallelujah
Zacharys are finished!
Cash? Seen him?
- You hear him shout something?
- Was it him or the wind?
- I saw the flash of his sabre.
- Where?
First over there and then over here.
- Maybe there's two of him.
- Well, there's two of us.
Arrows of God upon them!
He can't get far on a dead horse.
- Cash?
- Yeah.
I can't see for nothing, Ben.
Couldn't see a standing mountain in this storm.
It's hopeless, Cash. Hopeless for now.
Be three or four days till this norther blows itself out.
Three or four days, he'll be dead.
He'll dry up and blow away.
Kelseys don't die. They got to be killed.
Ben! Get him!
Hang on, Ben!
OK. OK.
Hang on, boy! Hang on, now!
Look at him! He'll never make it!
- Hold him! I'll ride him!
- You can get him, Charlie! Come on!
Ride him, Charlie! Ride him!
Stay with him, Charlie!
Charlie!
You don't hurt me none!
You didn't ride him long enough to get warm.
I'm right proud of you, Charlie.
Don't feel bad.
Ain't a man that can't be thrown.
Or ain't a horse that can't be rode.
Why don't you give her a try, paleface?
Easy, girl, easy.
Easy.
Ain't you the prettiest devil
I ever did see?
I'm going to ride you now.
Easy and slow.
It ain't going to hurt much.
Not after the first time, anyway.
You've got a bur in your pretty hair, ma'am.
Finish him, Ben. One less redhide.
You shut up, Cash.
- Ben's a mite touchy about Rachel.
- Yeah.
I got pay coming. And a bonus for every horse I busted so far.
- We pay off in Wichita.
- I ain't fired?
What for?
You're the party done all the suffering.
Anybody else see a bur in my sister's hair?
You, Rachel.
What reason you got to come smiling and sashaying round here other than female?
Am I so different from the other women?
They stick to their wagons.
Maybe they're just not interested in finding a husband.
Get on your horse and go home to Mama.
Ben!
Ben!
- What?
- He's gone!
- Who?
- Guipago's gone.
Guipago gone?
He wouldn't run away with his reins down.
I know he'd stand.
Who could have been so mean as to steal him?
- Maybe he run away.
- Not with his reins down. He'd stand.
If that don't beat all!
We ought to put up 100 dollars for that horse and a dollar for the thief.
We both know who stole the horse.
We'll have to find him.
Only an Injun would be crazy enough to steal him.
Like Zeb's saying, Ben,
I think it's Injun work.
- It's Injun work, all right.
- Maybe.
Come on, Rachel, honey.
Get on behind me. We're going home.
Ben, I never seen you so oddly thoughtful.
I don't care about that old horse if it's gonna worry you.
It ain't the horse, exactly.
- Tell me. It must be something dreadful.
- It's nothing.
Are you mad at me for sashaying around?
When I get you home,
I'm gonna whup you.
Tell me again, Ben.
Tell you what?
About the night Papa brought me home and the stars were falling.
Yes.
You were the prettiest baby
I ever did see.
- Am I still pretty?
- Nope. Old age has overtook you.
I saw blue butterflies down by the crick this morning.
About a million of them.
They were flying in twos, like sweethearts.
With four wings apiece.
That ain't a ladylike thing to say, is it?
Hang on to these days, Rachel.
Don't grow up too fast.
I got a big choice in this country, Ben.
I could marry that handsome, winsome Charlie.
Or that baby Jude.
- I could even marry you.
- Watch your language, girl.
Why not? We're not cousins.
We're not even relatives.
We're not even friends.
Ben, if you met me in Wichita, and had never saw me before, would you take after me hat in hand, mouth open, drunk or sober?
I just made up my mind.
Have you, Ben? Have you?
I'm gonna tell Charlie he can come courting if he wants to.
I already told him that.
Wake up, Cash. We got company.
What is it? What is it, Ben?
Kiowas! Dirty stinking Kiowas!
- What do they want, Ben?
- I don't know.
But we'd better fort up.
Rachel, stay away from that window.
May the Lord bless this food.
Andy.
And may the Lord deliver us from evil, red or white.
Amen.
Turn your plates over and hop to.
- Fill up, Andy.
- I'm a little off my feed this morning.
Ain't this something?
We sit here eating with the smell of those killers comin' through that window.
There's only three of them.
We can kill 'em before breakfast!
All right, Cash.
Let's first make sure they're after our scalps.
I'm gonna waste one.
They don't scare for nothing.
Medicine! They think they've got bulletproof medicine.
I'm going to parley.
Don't shoot unless you have to.
- When is that?
- When they break the peace and kill me.
No, Ben! You ain't to go out there!
Mama, I got some shirts need fixing.
- You ain't to go out there!
- Mama.
I'd hate to have to shut you in your room.
Rachel, get away from that window. Now.
I come in peace.
My land.
My sky.
You are welcome.
Young horses. Good for fighting.
Good for hunting.
- You take.
- I am ashamed.
I have nothing as good to give you in return.
You have in your house... woman.
One of our woman.
- Who told you this?
- Man of your tribe.
Old man. Carry long knife.
Him crazy.
Crazy man.
Sun... speak through him.
Dead people speak through mouth.
He speak.
Woman... my sister.
I her brother.
He lies.
How much woman worth?
There are not enough horses to pay for her.
Not all you can own or all you can steal.
We want see.
You show her to us.
The woman in my house is white.
Father white. Mother white.
They burned to death by you.
Kiowa!
You scared them. They're running.
- I told you to stay away from the window.
- I ain't afraid.
- I am.
- What did he want, Ben?
He wanted to buy a woman.
You.
- Did you sell me?
- I held out for more horses.
- Why would they want to buy me?
- Because you're a girl, my pretty.
Horses and women are all the same to a Kiowa. To be bought or traded.
- How did they hear about me?
- They must have seen you.
Kiowas are like panthers. Always sneaking about when you can't see 'em.
The one in the white buckskin,
I'll never forget him. He was beautiful.
A Kiowa? You're daft, child.
Look! He's coming back.
Just like the one that killed Papa.
He's out of range, Cash. Save your lead.
Cash! Cash!
Ben, we could have killed him!
We could have killed him!
Cash.
I reckon you'd better take the drive to Wichita.
I'd like that fine, Ben, but if trouble's coming I want to be here for it.
We got 6,000 cows. A lifetime's work.
I'd take it most kindly if you'd take the drive to Wichita.
Put it that way, I guess I gotta.
Pa! Injuns! Kiowas!
- Injuns!
- Kiowas!
- Red Injuns, Papa!
- Kiowas. Come down out of the hills.
A whole passel of 'em. Running across the swale! We come on 'em sudden.
- Charlie?
- Yes, Papa?
- You two been drinking?
- No, Papa.
That's the truth, Papa.
We could have lost our hair.
- I even seen war paint.
- You get back on them irons.
- But, Papa...
- Git!
Come on, Charlie. How many were there?
If I was to guess, it'd be anywhere...
To tell the truth, they were four, but they were taking the time of day, brazen as can be.
They see you?
They must have seen our dust.
Paid us no heed.
Hunting party, most likely.
Probably back in the hills already.
I told you, Zeb.
Indian sign all over the range.
You spent more time with cattle instead of sign, we could get this drive started.
All right, Charlie, let's run 'em through. Come on.
Why don't that old man come round us instead of sidling up to our womenfolk when we're away?
- If there be truth...
- It's gotta be faced up.
We gotta go to Zeb, tell him what...
Keep those brands high on the hip so we can see them from a long way off.
- Did you hear me, Tom?
- I heard you.
Ben! Ben!
The word is out, Ben.
- Kiowa scare talk.
- No, they've heard the lie.
It's sitting on their stomachs.
It's still a lie.
We got nothing to be ashamed of.
Ben.
What are you gonna do when they say it?
What will you do when they say it to Rachel's face?
Kill 'em, I guess.
Or anyone else who says it.
That's all I wanted to hear.
Well?
- What's on your minds?
- We want to talk to you, Zeb.
- Later.
- Now, Zeb. While they ain't here.
- Oh. Who ain't here?
- The Zacharys.
Well?
Don't it seem queer them Kiowas pick right now to move out of the hills?
Maybe the old man be loony, and maybe they be lies he be telling our womenfolk.
But we got a stake here in this land, in these cattle.
Maybe not as big as you, but still a stake.
Got our families to think of, Zeb.
Wives, children.
Them red devils move down on us now because...
Well, because...
Say it.
Go ahead, say it.
Well, speak up, why don't you?
Anyone here just say she be Injun blood, you'll get from me what her brothers'd give you.
You wait till Ben's back's turned.
Ben!
Who put you hog-high for four years when you might have had nothing to chew on but buffalo grass.
You take this filth, you believe this filth from an old man, and then you take it up with me instead of Ben.
Jude!
Take over here.
Hiya!
We'll make two more tonight, huh, Ben?
Ought to finish branding before daylight.
If the weather holds out, we could start the drive to Wichita tomorrow.
- You hear something, Ben?
- Get back, Rachel.
Andy.
You there! Put your hands on your hat!
- Both of them.
- It's me, Ben. I ain't fooling you.
It's only me.
What in hell are you doing out here?
I saw Rachel standing in there.
I guess I'm too shy to come forward.
- Does your old man know you're here?
- Sure. He gave me his courting hat.
- Claims he has no more use for it.
- You can put your hands down.
Thank you, sir.
- Go home. It's getting late.
- No, sir, I can't do that.
I come to ask the question, hoping she'll say yes.
If she don't,
I ain't coming back here no more.
I'm gonna leave home.
Go to San Francisco, get a job on the first vessel I see.
Maybe go to China.
I ain't thought that far ahead yet.
- Rachel.
- I'm right here.
You ain't about to shoot Charlie, are you, Ben?
I've been thinking about it.
But as long as I'm so short-handed, no.
Aren't you gonna kiss me, Charlie?
Ain't he kinda close?
You're gonna kiss me, not him.
Ben! I just kissed Charlie!
- So I'll have to marry him, I suppose.
- How do you say, Ben?
- I'll think on it.
- No.
Say yes or no right this minute,
Ben Zachary.
- Well, it's come to pass, Mama.
- What, Ben?
There's gonna be the biggest, noisiest, most devilish, glorious drinking and dancing wedding ever celebrated in this godforsaken part of the world.
- Wedding? Cash and Georgia!
- Not me, Mama.
- I'm talking about Rachel.
- Rachel?
Oh...
Give me some!
That's Wichita whisky. Aged four minutes.
Not long enough to cure whatever's in it.
- I know, but I need it.
- So do I.
My own little baby.
My own little baby getting married!
Charlie, he said yes!
- Rachel...
- Yippee!
Now tell me truth, girl.
Do you love him, Rachel?
Of course I do. Wouldn't any girl?
Ain't he the handsomest man walking?
I kissed her!
I kissed her.
No, it ain't possible.
I did kiss her. By God I did, baby!
I kissed her!
I kissed her! It's true I kissed her!
Whoa!
Ma thanks you kindly for coming.
There, there!
Zeb.
She don't seem to know me, child.
- I've got to put my arms around her.
- Yes, dear.
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
Get out of this house!
Dirty Injun, with your Injun ways!
- Ain't you done enough?
- Miz Rawlins...
Wound yourself around my son Charlie to get yourself a litter of half-breeds to run around my Charlie's cabin!
Squaw!
Kiowa squaw!
Red nigger as ever was!
- What does she mean?
- It's her grief.
You killed him. You killed him!
- You killed him!
- Woman...
- You killed him!
- Be quiet.
I've got to know the why of it, Ben.
It's the last thing I want to ask you, but I've got to know.
All right, Zeb.
There'll be no branding cattle, no drive to Wichita till we settle this thing between us.
I'll take every man who can sit a horse.
I'll bring him before you to admit his lies before I hang him.
Pray God they be lies, Ben.
I want every man jack of you to ride with me.
It ain't his.
- That's Guipago all right.
- He's an hour ahead of us.
On that white stallion, that's as good as a week.
~ Glory, glory, hallelujah
~ Glory, glory, hallelujah
Look at him. Damn his ugly soul!
Sitting up there laughing at us.
~ Glory, glory, halle...
I want the man who rides lightest to take my horse and two others and go after him.
That'll be you, Portugal. Where are you?
How much are you paying?
Nothing.
Give me that horse.
Giddup!
Ha-ha!
Here they come!
It's a welcome sight!
I say it in my heart, it's a welcome sight to see you folks here gathered.
How do, Mr. Rawlins, sir?
You think you've got a horse thief here.
Well, you ain't.
That horse I took from an Injun girl.
A redhide Injun.
And you can't do a man hurt for that, now, can you?
Mr. Rawlins,
I want you to know how sorry I am about your son, Mr. Rawlins.
There's nobody here knows better than me what it is to lose a son.
How did you know my son was dead?
Someone told me, of course.
- Who told you?
- Must have been somebody here.
Whoever it was, would you step forward, please?
I ain't gonna die.
Put it around his neck, boys.
Devils! You all turned to devils, devils!
You're all gonna burn on the day, devils.
Look at that book, Mr. Kelsey.
Touch your hands to it!
It's the Holy Bible, Mr. Kelsey.
Your last chance to cleanse your soul before you meet your maker.
God, O God, have them hearken unto me.
To me, O God, whose own son was took by the Kiowas.
Rachel Zachary.
I want to know about Rachel Zachary.
Injun. Redhide whelp as ever was.
True. It's true.
His papa knew.
Go on, old man.
And he knew my boy.
His name was Aaron.
He had blue eyes.
Young as he was,
I taught him to hold and fire a gun.
Tell us about Rachel Zachary.
It was raining.
Long ago.
We saddled up,
Will Zachary and me and many others.
Riding against the Kiowas for a massacre they done.
We come to an Injun camp.
We killed and we killed and we had to lay down tired of the killing.
I heard a baby cry.
I went and found her.
A little baby strapped to a Kiowa cradle board.
She had Injun paint on her belly, on the flat of her hands and the soles of her feet.
I had my hand on her throat and Will Zachary said to me
"There'll be no more killing. "
"No more killing today. "
And he took her from me.
I swear it.
I swear it as I know I'm about to die.
I swear it to you, God.
And he took her to Mattilda and they kept her as theirs.
Kept her in their own house.
And when the Kiowas captured my boy,
I come to Will Zachary and I said
"Give me that redhide baby for to trade, to take to the Kiowas for to get back my boy. "
Will Zachary wouldn't do it.
He wouldn't do it.
And my boy stayed captive.
His son is dead.
Killed by the Kiowas.
The very day my papa found Rachel - in a settler's wagon, wrapped in a Boston blanket.
Her parents were killed by the same Kiowas that killed his son.
But he wouldn't believe that.
He came to my papa and he said
"Will Zachary, swap her. "
"Swap Rachel. "
"She's white, but she's a foundling. "
"Give her to the Indians so I can get my son back. "
That's what he said to my papa, and my papa ran him off the land.
And Abe Kelsey rode vengeance on us till the people in each town turned against us.
Till my papa was killed by a Kiowa lance.
And that old man made you run.
That poor old man chased you from town to town.
That poor old man with his lies.
No. You run from the truth.
She knows.
She that washed off that Kiowa paint.
Washed it all off!
Though she still be as brown as the bark of a tree.
I hanged him! I hanged him!
Abe Kelsey won't go on to destroy no-one else with his lies.
It's finished, and high time.
Jude! Boys, lift me up.
I want to look at the man's face.
Can a man lie when he goes to meet his creator?
He wasn't lying, Zeb!
I told you that! And now you know it.
Rachel! Come here.
Come on, child. I ain't gonna hurt you.
Rachel! No!
I ain't scared, Mama.
You're dark. Darker than most.
But that could be the sun.
We have to look at your body.
- You leave her be.
- Strip her down! Strip her down naked!
Let the women take her in the house and undress her.
Anyone touches her, I'll put a bullet through their God-fearing gut!
Ben, I've loved you as well as I've loved my own sons, but we're finished.
Unless you pack this girl back to the Kiowas, we're partners no more.
Cash. Andy.
We're leaving.
Five years' work gone for nothing.
You'll lose every cent tied up in the cattle.
That's what you're doing, Ben.
Not a man here'll stand up with you.
Not one, Ben.
Early in the morning we'll cut out your herd.
May God help you, Ben.
Nobody here will.
Ben.
I smell Injun.
Rachel, Mama, don't move.
Let in some light, Cash.
What is it?
It's Kiowa.
A page out of their Bible, like.
Like chronicles.
This is old, Ben. Feel it.
30-odd years recorded here.
Winter by winter.
What does it say?
Falling stars.
The year of the falling stars.
Baby girl strapped to a cradle.
- Burn it!
- Don't touch it, Mama.
Burn it, Ben!
I won't have it in my house!
Please, Mama.
Read what it says, Ben.
Read it, Ben.
Kiowa baby girl stolen from their camp.
By white men, with rifles.
Did Abe Kelsey paint this, Mama?
Did he do this?
Did he put these lies down year by year?
Did he, Mama? Did he?
That man you hanged last night in Rawlins' yard.
You tell me, Mama.
Answer him, Mama.
Answer him, Mama.
All right!
It's the truth.
My sister's an Injun?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes!
If we could only raise some decent flowers instead of these scrawny things.
Your papa brought me the little girl child.
He put her in my arms as I lay crying.
I'd just lost my own little girl baby with yellow curls.
Not old enough to be named when she died.
So I gave her promised name to Rachel.
My ownest Rachel.
My beautiful little Indian baby.
My breasts were hurting with all that milk.
I wish we could raise nasturtiums.
Then we could have a yardful, like when I was a girl.
I just love nasturtiums.
What you fixing to do, Ben?
Get this wood in.
I mean about everything.
We can't stay here no longer, Ben.
We got to pull up stakes.
Or else send Rachel away.
A man sets down roots, Cash.
He don't like 'em cut off - by Kiowas or anyone else.
With her out of here we could at least get our cattle to market.
Cash, you want the cattle that bad, you take them. All of them.
You tell Zeb you and me don't see eye to eye.
And that's for truth.
Take that cattle drive and keep the profits.
Don't twist my words around, Ben.
- We've got to get her out of here.
- Where to?
An Injun camp?
Or to squat outside the garrison at Wichita and pick up silver dollars from the troopers, huh?
Why don't you say it, Cash?
Damn you, why don't you say it?
It's not Kiowas or cattle!
It's the Injun in the house!
Get her out of here!
I don't care how! Get her out of here!
I'm staying, Cash.
She's staying.
We're all staying.
I'm not staying.
Not with a redhide nigger!
Get going, Cash.
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy, piggy!
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy! Piggy, piggy!
Here, piggy, piggy!
Cash!
Cash!
- Cash!
- I left my family.
- Why?
- They turned.
Indian lovers! Injun lovers!
Can't stay there no more.
Can't stay there no more.
I'm a little bit drunk, Georgia.
You can sleep it off in there.
Or there's the bed in my room, if you marry me.
I'm drunk, but I ain't that drunk.
Oh, Cash, come on!
Ben!
Ben!
They're coming.
The same three, it looks like.
- Only three?
- That's all that's coming up.
But I figure there's 40 strong across the river.
You figure they came to parley, Ben?
They'll ask for her first.
Then they'll try to take her.
Rachel?
- Rachel.
- I'm going out there, Ben.
There won't be any fight.
I'm going out to my people, where I belong!
You're staying here.
You can stop me now, but I'll go out to them first chance I get.
- Andy?
- Sir?
They still out there?
- They're still there.
- Kill one.
Kill one?
They're under a sign of peace, Ben.
- Kill one!
- No! No!
Go ahead, Andy.
It's done, Ben.
- They'll never turn back now.
- You can bet on it.
Not till you're all dead.
Ain't much point in going out now, is there?
Why didn't you let me go?
Why did you stop me?
When Mama told the truth this morning
I wanted to die.
And you wanted to die too.
I could see it in your faces.
You had to turn away.
Why let yourselves be killed on account of me?
Little Injun.
Little redhide Injun.
- Andy.
- Sir?
Turn out that light.
That gun shoots a little high, Rachel, so draw a fine bead.
When they get so close you want to scream, don't scream, just shoot.
What if I can't do it, Ben?
You can.
I've never killed anybody before.
The gun does the killing.
- My own kind.
- By blood, yes.
But not by anything else.
Funny. I don't remember all them bushes out there.
- There wasn't.
- How's that, Ben?
One of them's moving.
Slow down, Andy.
You're shooting too fast.
Sister!
We did it.
We beat 'em off!
Just like I said.
- I did what you told me.
- You did fine. Real fine.
The music of their flutes.
Magic.
To make them bulletproof.
We'll give them some magic of our own.
Lend a hand, Andy.
Mama!
Play something, Mama.
Make it loud. Good and loud.
Mama, that's enough magic for tonight.
Andy, you take over Mama's gunport.
Here they come.
Andy! To the side port!
Still on its hinges, Ben?
Still holding.
What is it?
I hear gunfire.
- In your head.
- No, I hear it, I tell you.
You couldn't, Cash.
Your house is ten miles away.
Yeah. It's stopped now.
I didn't hear anything even before it stopped.
- Could be they ran out of ammunition.
- Forget about that.
Don't think about anything but me.
I know I could make you happy.
I know it, Cash.
Now, Cash.
Right now.
Georgia, get me some ammunition.
Rim-fires, if you've got 'em.
All you can spare.
- Papa has 'em locked up. He wouldn't...
- I know!
He wouldn't lift his little finger off his Bible to save a Zachary.
Stay here, Cash.
Don't think about anything in the whole world except me.
- Andy?
- Sir?
How's the ammunition holding up?
- Not too many, Ben.
- No more firing till they go to break in.
And here. Give this to Mama.
Rachel.
Just in case.
Ma!
- You've been hit.
- My arm. Nothing much to it.
Get back to your gunport, Andy.
Mama.
Mama, you better get some rest while you can.
Stop fussing. I've hurt myself worse with a kitchen knife.
You just lie here a while.
I'll be all right, I tell you.
Keep this by you.
Oh, Mama.
My poor baby. My baby.
- I'm sorry if I did wrong.
- Hush, Mama.
About Cash...
Don't mind. He was always fiery-tempered, even as a little boy.
You don't have to explain Cash to me.
Andy, you still got those lead soldiers?
- I ain't played with them since...
- I know where they are, Ben.
Ain't a very big army coming to our rescue.
There's one thing I sure regret.
That I ain't never got to Wichita and had me... that glass of beer.
Is it pain to die, Ben?
We ain't gonna die, Rachel.
We're gonna live.
We're gonna lick those Kiowas.
We've got to take a trip to Wichita.
- Me too?
- All of us.
You, me, Mama, Andy, all of us.
We'll do it up real good.
Yeah?
We're gonna fit you out in a fancy dress.
A white one, with veils.
- Veils?
- That's what they wear for the occasion.
- We gonna have a wedding, Ben?
- We're gonna get a town preacher.
We're gonna hire some music.
We're gonna have a fine old time.
Ben.
Oh, Ben.
Hear that, Mama? Hear that?
We're going to Wichita and have ourselves...
Get in the root cellar, Rachel.
Mama!
- Andy.
- Mama!
Back in the root cellar. Hurry!
Hole in her side.
Never said a word.
Mama?
Mama!
More coal oil, Andy.
He's coming to, Ben.
The fire won't hold them off much longer.
- How's your arm, Andy?
- Fine.
- Can you handle your gun?
- I guess so.
Never was much good left-handed.
It's a six-gun!
Could it be Cash? Could it?
It's gotta be Cash!
I knew he'd come back!
- I told you, Ben!
- Whoa, hoss.
Stay here with Rachel.
Andy! Andy!
Andy.

ENHOH
We give the whip to wild animals when they try to rebel.
This way you'll learn not to try to escape again.
Take this.
You know what this cross means don't you?
Mexican's bitch!
Let fire clean away your sins!
And you from what cemetery have you come from?
If you came here to bury these bastards... hurry up, and get it done without a word.
Instead, I like to talk.
From the way you're talking, it seems you're in a hurry... to end up in the coffin you've got behind you.
Maybe.
Are you from the North?
I fought for the North.
We don't like those who fought for the North.
This is the South.
I see it, brother. I see it.
Enough! Who cares about this gravedigger.
Let's take care of the woman now.
It's not nice to take it out on women.
What did you say?
It doesn't matter.
What matters is that you're about to die.
My name is Django.
As long as you stay with me, nobody will harm you.
You wouldn't make it very far.
Besides, it's not yet time to cross that bridge.
For now, my path goes in the opposite direction.
What's your name?
- Maria.
- Let's go.
A bed for the girl.
Anything for you, stranger.
But the girl...
No, she can't stay here.
And there are no more rooms We're full.
Go and see.
The key to your room.
Give it to me, come on.
Don't worry. 
I'll pay for the inconvenience.
I think that's enough.
Oh, well, thank you!
Look at this!
Go to sleep.
You've had quite an eventful day.
The room is upstairs, at the end.
Tomorrow morning the girl has to leave.
No later than tomorrow, I'm sorry.
Understood?
There's no need to hurry, my friend.
Bring me something to eat.
Here.
If you work in the coffin business, you chose well.
There is plenty of work here.
So far, I've met only a few customers.
When the damn war started between... the Mexicans and Major Jackson's soldiers... they moved everybody out reducing the town to this.
A dead town.
And your women sleep with the ghosts?
We manage...
A bit with the Mexicans, and a bit with the Major's men.
We want to be at peace with everybody.
Without being unfair.
Well, we have an agreement...
This is a neutral place...
We try very hard to stay alive.
You are new to this place, young man...
You don't know Major Jackson...
You don't know him, do you?
Stop trying to figure out who I know, old man.
Don't you want to offer me a drink?
You know, it takes guts to travel with that girl.
It means having to face both the racists and the Mexicans.
I like having to face people.
Oh, really? Well, so much the better.
You know, my colleagues are afraid of the coffin.
It doesn't scare me.
It's just like any other job.
Is someone in there?
Someone called Django.
Good day, brother Jonathan.
This is all I was able to put together.
For this month's share... business isn't going well.
In that case it'll be better if you talk about this to the Major.
I'm getting a dress to change into.
You know, the Major's men should be here soon.
Maybe he'll come here himself.
The Major doesn't like green.
He's crazy about red.
Here.
I'll change here.
I'm used to my mirror.
Don't be upset.
Maybe you can save yourself... if you are nice to the Major.
Why don't you dress yourself in red? Go on.
Dress in red, and you'll be safe.
The Major isn't after you.
It's the Mexicans he can't stand.
He says it's their skin color that bothers him.
Well, you're really asking for it.
You could have stayed with us.
But you had to run away and ended up... right in the hands of Jackson's worst enemies, the Mexicans.
Why did you run away from them as well?
But, what is it you want?
I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
Listen, are you kidding me?
Of course, they'll get rid of your man.
What a pity, he's such a good-looking guy.
A pack of cards, please.
He wants a pack of cards.
You like to play with the deadly Ace of Spade, uh?
Listen to me, and you'll manage to save yourself.
Make yourself as pretty as you can, it won't be hard.
Thanks, but it's pointless.
Damn!
That's Jackson having fun.
Some Mexican must have refused to pay... and so, they make him run...
Terrible!
Go on!
Another one.
I'm bored now. You take care of it.
An interesting new arrival in town.
They'll be coming here now, and they'll want to have fun.
Come. Lock yourself in, and don't move.
Major Jackson and his men are coming!
Good day, Major Jackson.
Welcome! Make yourselves at home.
Come...
Unfortunately, it's not all of it, but, as soon as I am able to...
I believe you, Nathaniel.
I believe you.
Cowards never lies I know that well.. especially when they're paying for their protection.
You'll pay me your share at the fort in a week.
In a week? As you wish.
Thank you, Major, thank you.
Hey, you, come upstairs with me.
- I don't want to.
- Come on, let's go.
I don't want to, it's not as if you'd bought me.
If you don't want to go with him, you come with me.
She told you she doesn't feel like it.
Let her go.
Stop it!
Send away all the girls, Nathaniel.
Let's go girls, go upstairs.
You, too.
That's lucky.
One must be very brave to talk this way to Ringo.
Brave, or crazy.
Just like the dirty Northerner, who killed five of my men down by the river.
That must have been some smart guy.
Five men in one go?
That's specialist' work.
The man also took a woman with him.
A whore who was sold to the Mexicans.
One who betrayed our race.
The war is over, and these things are outdated now.
I am sorry to contradict you, but my war never ends, my friend.
That's clever to bring a coffin with you.
You'll get a special favour treatment, you'll be... buried.
Usually we feed Northern bastards to vultures, to poison them.
I didn't know this racial matter also involved those poor vultures.
I thought it only concerned Southern pigs.
We can proceed, men.
We've talked for the day.
I've got one more shot left.
But, that would be too easy.
How many more men do you have... pig?
I asked, how many more men?
Forty.
Good, pig.
Bring all forty of them with you next time.
It will be more fun.
I'll still be here waiting for you.
Rest assured. We'll come.
You can put things back in order.
But don't use my coffin.
I am taking a blanket.
Thank you.
For what?
For what you have done for me.
I didn't do it for you.
Well, then, thank you even if you didn't do it for me.
You thank too much.
Who knows if was right to save you?
I thank you because, even if it was just for a few moments... you gave me the feeling of having a man at my side... who could protect me... who could love me.
Then we must make sure that the illusion is complete.
Brief, but complete.
Why did you let Major Jackson go?
He'll return with his 40 thugs and he will kill us all.
I know him too well. Unfortunately.
What are you afraid of, old man?
You pay to be protected by him.
I pay so that I won't be killed like those he calls inferior... because their skin's a bit darker.
The sun, also, darkens the skin.
Yes, but Jackson and his men don't want to admit that.
They have some sort of religion.
Did you see the red hoods they wear?
They're fanatics! Crazy!
Sometimes, it's necessary to eliminate the fanatics, the madmen... for the good of everyone.
I know, but you can't do it alone.
I am not alone.
Leave. Take the girl with you and go far away.
You worry too much, old man.
It could ruin your health.
Quickly, before Jackson arrives.
Go! You could try to get to the swamp and escape to the other side of it.
It's better if you go back inside.
There's no change to my plan.
If he finds you here, he'll blame us, too!
He'll kill us.
There is nothing to be afraid of, old man.
I told you...
I am not alone.
If you could go to the Mexicans, maybe those two would be saved.
Great, but I wouldn't make it alive, not even to the cemetery.
With all those hooded men gathering,
I have to be honest...
I am sorry, but I am forced to hope they'll kill him right away.
He'll suffer less, and I will lose less customers.
Mother of God!
It's over, old man.
You won't have to pay anymore to stay alive.
Did you kill them all?
Almost all of them.
Don't worry. You'll still have the Mexicans as customers.
Get rid of those dead guys now.
And where will I put them?
We'll have to open another cemetery.
Cemeteries are a good investment here... if you can get paid in advance.
And Major Jackson? Is he dead as well?
No, I let him go.
Why?
Because it wasn't his time yet.
I need him alive for now.
If they had told me that
I would end up as a gravedigger... and without pay.
Well, anyway... better above than under.
Someone you knew?
A part of my life.
Probably the only one that really mattered.
Did Jackson's men kill her?
They killed her.
And where were you when it happened?
Far away... too far away, old man.
This damn woman is the incarnation of sin.
It's her who made blood rain on the town.
Yes, that's true.
Because of you we'll have to leave.
Men won't come to this town anymore.
We'll starve to death!
Don't be silly!
Maria is not to blame for what happened.
No, it's the truth!
Smash her, destroy her... if you don't want that creep to hurt you again.
Leave her alone!
What has she done to you?
Why are you tormenting her?
Screw off, you bitch!
We don't want you.
Go away from here!
Don't be stupid!
It's her who's responsible!
I'll show you!
The Mexicans are coming!
You wanted to run, uh?
But, you didn't make it in time?
You are Jackson's damn spy!
You tell them what you see and what you hear... because you have big ears.
And we know what to do with big ears.
Right, muchachos?
No, no!
Move!
Hey, Yankee!
I thought there were no more bastards left in town.
Are you Hugo's men?
Wait!
It's better to take him to the General.
He might want him alive.
Escaping from us was a dangerous thing to do, Maria.
I could punish you harshly for what you did.
What would you say if I cut off one of your beautiful ears?
You had no right to keep me prisoner!
I had the right that every man has with all the women he likes!
You know, Hugo, you're talking just like one of Jackson's racists.
Bitch!
Careful Maria.
I don't allow this from anyone.
Don't forget that you are half Yankee and half Mexican.
Don't let me remember the one half I hate.
Look who's here.
The most clever Gringo of the entire frontier.
Hombre! It has been so long since I last saw your dirty face!
This is Django.
A deserter, thief, and to me, more than a friend!
A brother.
Now we are even.
Calm down, Ricardo!
I owe Django a lot!
Only your life which I saved once in prison.
And now your woman.
I brought her back to you, Hugo.
She is in good condition.
Take her back.
She is not my woman.
She is just one woman.
I'm thirsty.
We have to celebrate our meeting!
To your health, Django!
To the death of Jackson's pigs!
Long live the revolution!
Death to Jackson!
Those pigs aren't here anymore.
He killed them all.
You were able to kill all those bastards by yourself?
That's impossible!
How did you do that, Django?
It wasn't very difficult.
If you had been in my place, you would have done it too.
Of course.
But my men are tired.
They'd all like to go home.
Me too, but in Mexico, the government men are waiting for us.
And we don't have enough weapons to fight against them.
Of course.
But I could help you, Hugo.
And how?
Lord!
This toy is worth 150 guns in one go.
It's with this that I exterminated the Major's men.
What type of weapon is this?
Get out of the way, men.
You could get hurt.
No! Don't do it, Django!
I beg you!
These are the kind of weapons
I would need!
With ten of these it would be easy to go back to Mexico. Right, Hugo?
Where are the other nine?
They are in Pecos waiting to be bought.
I know the man who sells them.
Thank you for the information, Django.
But our's is a poor revolution.
If you are poor, you have to try to become rich.
That's the only way you can win.
Did you come here to pull my leg?
No, I came here to help you and to get help.
Well, explain yourself!
At the fort there is gold for you and for me.
The fort is very far from the border.
I can't return to Mexico... at least not until I have the 10 machine guns.
Plus, those government dogs are many more than us.
The men of the fort every Saturday receive a visit from Nathaniel... who brings his... wagonload of women over the border.
Isn't that right, old man?
Uh, yeah.
Explain yourself better, Django.
This week Jackson will also go to the fort to stash his gold safely in Mexico.
That's why I kept him alive.
I want that gold even more than his death.
And that gold will be ours!
Understood?
Understood!
But how?
It will be difficult, that's for sure.
But with the help of my toy it will also be fun.
The women have arrived!
Finally, they have arrived!
It's about time!
The women are here!
Hurray, the women!
Over here!
Pigs!
Cowards!
Let's go!
Come on! Get the horses!
Move it, Ricardo!
Go!
The machine gun is stuck!
Go on!
If we get across the border, we'll be safe!
Let's go then!
Come on. Why don't you carry on?
We have to stop.
Otherwise, we'll enter American territory.
Hurray! General Hugo has arrived!
Men! We are back!
It was a fantastic trip!
Django's action was a complete success!
- With the gold we'll buy the weapons!
- Hurray!
We'll go back to Mexico.
We'll win the revolution!
Hurray the revolution!
You see Hugo, we made it.
Oh, yes!
All that's left is to divide the gold and say goodbye.
Give me my share.
Just like that?
Do you really want to leave just now?
Well, I have nothing more to do in this town.
What do you mean, 'nothing more', brother?
Together we'll do great things!
I'll make you lieutenant of my revolution!
You already have many lieutenants, and I only want what I'm owed. Please.
Are you kidding?
You'll get double, double, you understand?
Once I am in power.
Hugo...
I want my gold.
Oh... Brother, you're obsessed.
Nobody will take your gold.
Don't you trust me?
He doesn't trust me.
You know, we'll keep your gold in a safe place.
Let me show you where. Come.
There we are.
There is only one door and many guards.
The gold for our revolution will be well guarded.
No one will be able to take it away.
It's a pile of gold, but in powder.
Take this. Drink.
No.
What's the matter, bitch?
Are you in a bad mood because the American doesn't care about you?
Come, I'll comfort you!
Damn you!
Ricardo!
Leave Maria alone.
And you would give her to that bastard American!
It's better if I take her!
I decide who will take her!
You bastard!
Thank you, Django.
You saved my life once more. I won't forget it.
Look at Maria. Look at her.
She can't take her eyes off you.
Take her! My gift to you.
You'll spend a wonderful night.
Thanks. But she's not my type.
I prefer this one.
You see, Maria?
The Gringo prefers the dark one!
Don't be hurt. Come and drink with us!
Tonight is a great night!
Come on, muchachos!
Tequila for everyone!
Get undressed.
Carry on undressing.
Don't pay attention to what I'm doing.
Look!
- My goodness!
- Look.
Look!
Beautiful, uh?
Just a minute!
The horses are fleeing!
Quick let's catch them.
You have to take me with you, Django!
All right, as you wish.
Hurry up, Django, hurry!
Watch out!
Prepare the men, Miguel.
We're going hunting!
Take the carriage. Go via the valley and you'll soon reach the pass.
You'll be safe there.
And you?
It's time for me to cross that bridge.
I waited an entire life waiting to bury Django in this coffin.
The gold will help me make him disappear forever.
Let go of that gold, Django!
What do you care about it?
We'll start a new life together.
I'll help you forget.
I love you, Django.
I left love behind many years ago.
Now it rests under one of the many crosses of the tombstone cemetery.
If I bring you with me, you'd risk ending up the same way.
And, maybe you wouldn't make me forget.
Django!
Oh, Django!
Now that we meet again, Django...
Where is the gold?
The mud swallowed it.
A horse stumbles, a coffin slips... it's fate, General.
It certainly won't be the lost gold, my friend, that will change my fate.
We'll go back to Mexico anyway, right?
The decision has already been made.
Now we are even, Django.
You saved my life two times, and I did the same, back then and now.
I'm not going to kill you.
We don't kill thieves, not even when they betray a friend.
We punish thieves in a different manner.
Right, Miguel?
Bastard!
This is for our revolution!
And this is for the gold you stole!
Damn you!
Damn dog!
Thief!
You disgusting coward!
It's your turn, men.
However good a gunman is, he still needs his hands, am I right Django?
Pray that Jackson doesn't find you.
It would be embarrassing for you.
Goodbye now, Django.
My men and I will go back to Mexico... to win or to die.
Let's go, Companeros!
Bye, Gringo!
We'll meet again in hell!
Let's go!
Pigs!
Help her, Nathaniel.
I think she can still be saved.
Alright. I'll do all that is possible.
But you leave now, don't stay here.
Jackson could come back here any moment.
Django, leave! Save yourself, run away before it's too late.
Don't worry about me.
There is one more thing I have to do.
I have to kill Jackson.
That's the only way for this town and I to get back to life.
One can't keep running away.
One has to stop and fight to the very end.
I understood that when I was squeezing your hand tightly... while the coffin was going down in the Savannah.
If I should fail, then at least I will have tried... to redeem myself.
Django, your... your hands.
My hands will still be able to serve me.
Nathaniel, hide Maria, and tell Jackson that I'll wait for him... at the crosses of the tombstone cemetery... because his time has come.
Django is waiting for you at the crosses of the Tombstone cemetery.
But you have nothing to fear.
They smashed his hands.
You thought you had won, right, Django?
Instead, here I am, to fight my war... a war that will never end.
Praying is the right thing to do when you're near death.
You can't make the sign of the cross with those hands!
I will help you make it!
In the name of the Father... the Son... and the Holy...
Spirit!
Amen!

- You bet!
Link. Link Appleyard!
- Miss Hallie.
- Hello, Marshal.
- Howdy, Mr Senator.
- No, no. Rance. Rance.
Rance. Sure glad you could come.
Your wire caught us in St Louis.
Thank you.
My buckboard's right over there.
Jason, give me that box.
You knew they were coming!
That's the first time you ever kept a secret! Blabbermouth!
Was that anybody worth a line in the paper?
A line? You blasted young fool, that's Senator Stoddard and his wife.
You can fill your newspaper with them!
Hi, Lydia. Charlie Hasbrouck.
Emergency!
Tell the office Senator Stoddard and his wife just got here!
- That's right! Thanks!
- Hey, that's a nickel!
Charge the "Shinbone Star"!
Senator! Senator Stoddard, ma'am.
Could you give me an interview?
Exclusive-like. A scoop!
"Shinbone Star"...
Well, now, son... all right.
I'll give the interview, but only for one reason.
One reason. Dutton Peabody, founder, publisher, editor in chief of the "Shinbone Star" once fired me.
I'll be fired if I don't get this interview.
Is it true you're going to...
Here he comes now.
Senator Stoddard, this is a surprise and an honour, sir!
- Maxwell Scott, editor.
- How do you do, Mr Scott?
- This is Mrs Stoddard.
- A pleasure, ma'am.
What brings you back to town, sir?
Is it true?
Oh, no. Hold on, Mr Scott.
Who am I giving this interview to, you or this young fellow?
- Who asked first, by the way.
- I sure did.
If you're a good reporter invite them in, out of the sun and dust.
He's right. To make a man talk, make him comfortable.
It's back in business again.
Politics.
Link, why don't you take Hallie for a little ride around town?
Lot of changes, huh?
I'll go with these fellows and mend a few political fences.
I notice you're not wearing the star.
Shucks, Miss Hallie. They haven't elected me Town Marshal for ages.
The only one of us from the old days still working steady is the senator.
Place has sure changed.
Churches, high school, shops.
Well, the railroad done that.
Desert's still the same.
- The cactus rose is in blossom.
- Maybe...
Maybe you'd like to take a ride out desert way, and maybe look around.
Maybe.
You knew where I wanted to go, didn't you?
Well, you said you wanted to see the cactus blossoms.
There's his house down there, what's left of it.
Blossoms all around it.
He never did finish that room he started to build on, did he?
No...
Well, you know all about that.
There's a lovely one there.
Gentlemen, I promised myself this trip I would not talk politics, and look here, that's about all I've been doing.
Surely you're going to Capitol City and talk to the assembly?
Not this trip. It's purely personal.
Purely personal? That isn't good enough for my readers.
Why did you come to Shinbone?
No mystery, is there?
No. No, there's no mystery.
I'm here to go to a funeral.
- Funeral?
- Who's dead, sir?
- No, sir. I...
- A man by the name of Tom Doniphon.
There's my good wife. I'll...
I've enjoyed the visit, gentlemen.
Tom Doniphon?
- Hello, Clute.
- Ransom Stoddard! And Miss Hallie!
Senator, I didn't think... Why didn't you let me know they was coming?
I'd have had a real bang-up funeral.
Folks from all over everywhere would have come.
The county's gonna bury him.
I won't make a nickel out of it.
Pompey?
- Miss Hallie.
- Pompey, I'm sorry.
Maybe you'd like to...
Where are his boots?
They was an awful nice pair of boots, almost brand-new, and I thought...
Put his boots on, Clute, and his gun belt and his spurs.
He didn't carry no handgun, Rance.
He didn't for years.
Yeah, sure.
Sir, I don't wish to intrude, but a United States senator is news.
I'm the editor of a newspaper with a statewide circulation.
I've got a responsibility to know why you came all the way down here to bury a man.
You can't say his name was
Tom Doniphon and leave it at that.
Who was Tom Doniphon?
He was a friend, Mr Scott, and we'd like to be left alone.
Scott, let's go.
I'm sorry. That's not enough.
I have a right to have the story.
Yes, I guess maybe you have.
This story not only concerns me.
Old Pompey in there, Link... they were part of it.
But I suppose I'm the only one who can tell it through.
I read of the old days in the paper's files. There was no mention...
You're a young man! A young man.
You only know it since the railroad came.
A lot different then. A lot different before, Mr Scott. A lot different.
First time I came to Shinbone,
I came by stagecoach.
A lot like that one right there.
Could be the same one.
Could be the same one.
"Overland"?
Say, I think it is the same one!
Well, I declare.
Well, I declare.
I was just a youngster, fresh out of law school, bag full of law books and my father's gold watch, $14.80 in cash.
I had taken
Horace Greeley's advice literally:
Go west, young man, go west, and seek fame, fortune, adventure.
Stand and deliver!
Shotgun, shuck your shells.
Throw down the cash box. Now!
All right.
Get the passengers out of the coach.
Looks like slim pickings, but lift their wallets anyway.
- I'll take that pin, too.
- No. My dead husband gave it to me.
- Please!
- A widow? I'll take it...
Take your hands off!
What kind of men are you?
This kind, dude.
Now, what kind of man are you, dude?
I am an attorney at law, and I'm duly licensed by the territory.
You may have us now, but I'll see you in jail for this!
Jail?
Stop it!
Get him out of here!
Get in that coach! Go on, move!
Get in there! You, too!
Come on, inside!
- He could die!
- We'll send him flowers!
Chico, cut the leaders!
Get going!
Put that in here and get to your horses. Hurry!
A book?
Law?
Lawyer, huh?
I'll teach you law... Western law.
Let's get out of here.
Come on! Come on!
Hallie! Wake up, gal!
Tom Doniphon! 5:30am.
What's the matter with you?
We've got a man down here ambushed.
Ambushed!
Like to die if we don't get care for him.
- It's the man from the hold up.
- That's right.
How did you know?
Stagecoach stopped by last night to notify the marshal.
Link Appleyard?
Don't stand there gossiping.
Get him inside. Pompey!
Think you can make it, pilgrim?
Pick him up, Pompey.
Put him on the couch.
Tom, he's hurt real bad.
Thanks, Pompey.
Poor man. Beaten, whipped and kicked, just for trying to protect a woman.
- How's that again?
- Stage driver told us all about it.
Well, Pompey, looks like we got ourselves a ladies' man.
Hallie, we...
- Get some bandage.
- But...
I'll take care of him.
Pilgrim, you'll need a couple of stitches.
Pompey, go find Doc Willoughby.
If he's sober, bring him back.
Nora, sorry to bust in on you like this. He's in trouble.
- Such a beating.
- This is just simply terrible.
By golly,
I'm going to get the marshal.
You want coffee?
I make some breakfast. Hallie?
Take her easy there, pilgrim.
You all right?
Here we are. Drink this.
Is that coffee?
Yah, coffee, and aquavit.
Swedish brandy. Good for you.
No, I don't care for that.
Here, you must drink.
That make you feel better.
It ain't mannerly out west to let a fellow drink by himself.
- All right if I smoke, ain't it?
- Sure. Go right ahead.
- Good. Now you will feel stronger.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Took my watch. My money's gone, every cent I had in the world.
Don't fret about that, pilgrim.
You can eat here until you get back on your feet.
- My credit's still good, Nora?
- Yah, Tom.
- Lie down. Please lie down.
- No. No, not now.
Not now.
I've got something to do.
Got something to do.
What did you say his name was?
The man with the silver-knobbed whip?
I said Liberty Valance, but if that's what you got to do, you better start packing a handgun.
A gun? I don't want a gun.
I don't want a gun.
I don't want to kill him.
I want to put him in jail.
I know those law books mean a lot to you, but not out here.
Out here, a man settles his own problems.
But do you know what you're saying to me?
You're saying just exactly what Liberty Valance said.
What kind of community have I come to?
You all seem to know Liberty Valance.
He's a no-good, gun-packing, murdering thief, but the only advice you give me is to carry a gun.
Well, I'm a lawyer!
Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law.
And the law is the only...
A little law and order around
Shinbone wouldn't hurt anyone.
All right, Hallie.
Arrest this man! Arrest him!
Nobody seems to want...
Well.
Here comes Mr Law and Order himself.
- He's hurt bad.
- What are you dragging me here for?
Ain't being up all night on account of this hold up business...
- Who's this?
- From the hold up.
- I knew I shouldn't come over.
- Wait a minute, Marshal.
Tom, if he's got a formal complaint to make, he should make it to me.
He just wants you to put Liberty Valance in jail.
Liberty Valance? Do you think
I'm crazy? Tom, let me out of here.
Hallie thinks he's right.
You'd better listen. He's a lawyer.
Somebody better listen to somebody about him!
Mamma, Liberty Valance rides into town...
If he behaves himself in this town,
I ain't got no...
Jurisdiction.
What he said.
I ain't got none of it.
You all know
I'm only the town marshal.
What Liberty does out on the road ain't no business of mine.
Ain't that right, Mr Lawyer?
Technically, I suppose it is a territorial offence.
- You mean I'm right?
- Yes, Marshal, you're right.
I knew it! I knew we'd be friends the minute I stepped in here.
You folks all know that, well, the jail's only got one cell, and the lock's broke, and I sleep in it.
I should have known nothing would happen when you came in here.
Now get out, you big old fat water buffalo!
- We got work to do!
- Hallie, I ain't ate yet.
I could sure use a snack of six or seven of those hen's egg and maybe a side order of bacon, and is that flapjack batter?
On the cuff. Sit down.
Papa, get your pants on!
Get out of the way! Sit down!
You know, you look mighty pretty when you get mad.
Like I say, you can eat here till you get back on your feet.
- May I have your name?
- Doniphon. Tom Doniphon.
Forget what I said about buying a gun. You're a tenderfoot.
Liberty Valance is the toughest man south of the Picketwire, next to me.
- Mr Peabody!
- Evening, Marshal.
Did you know that Liberty Valance is in town tonight?
I'd be a poor newspaperman indeed if I didn't know what everybody else knows.
I don't know what to do,
Mr Peabody, I swear.
Do what you're paid to. Run him out!
Run him out... Liberty Val... me?
- My advice to you as...
- Coroner.
- And your personal pos...
- Physician!
Is to get supper and go to bed.
No charge.
Sound advice, Marshal. Sound advice.
Hallie, my love, where are you?
I await you, my dear.
Good evening.
Saturday night, Mr Peabody.
Better order early before those drunks come from across the street.
Hallie, please. The proprieties concerning the cutlery.
How many times have I told you, the fork goes to the left of the plate, the knife goes...
You superstitious or something?
What are you having to eat?
The usual.
Steak, beans, potatoes and deep-dish apple pie.
- Three steaks with a lot of black.
- All right.
- Lot of black-eyes, Hallie.
- All right, Kaintuck!
Three steaks, burnt black for the Lazy "J" boys.
Heavy on the beans.
Usual for Mr Peabody with fixings.
- Steak, beans, potatoes.
- And deep-dish apple pie.
Someday, he'll order something different, and we'll all faint.
Goodness, Rance, aren't you finished yet?
No wonder if your mind isn't on it.
Let me help.
Hallie, I found it. I'll show...
No, my hands are wet.
Get the book.
Come on, take the book a minute.
Nora, Peter, come here and hear this.
Now, get the book.
That place right here where it says,
"Under the law of this territory."
Hallie, you read it out loud.
I got Liberty Valance exactly where
I want him. Exactly where I want him.
What's the matter? Go ahead. Read it.
- I can't.
- What? You... Well, why not?
I never had the schooling, that's why not.
You mean you can't read at all?
No, I can't read, and I can't write.
Here, take your book.
For heaven's sakes, isn't Mr Peabody's order ready?
- Hallie...
- Not enough beans on it.
Hallie, I'm sorry.
I could teach you.
What for? What good has reading and writing done you?
Look at you. In an apron.
Be right with you, boys.
I do look funny in this.
I didn't mean to hurt her.
She'll get over it. What is reading and writing for a girl?
She'll make a wonderful wife for any man.
And if Tom Doniphon is smart, he pops the question before some busybody I am married to upsets his bag of apples.
Aw, you!
Eat supper before come the drunks.
- But I'm not finished.
- Go sit down! Eat!
What you cooking, steak and potatoes?
I'm hungry. Could I impose upon your hospitality?
Just a couple of those steaks and no beans.
Marshal.
You're the man I'm looking for.
Not so loud.
And double on the potatoes.
One steak for one marshal on the cuff.
Marshal, I was wrong the other day, but I've been reading up, and there it is.
I'll draw up the complaint, take care of the details, but you do have jurisdiction, it says so right there.
The next time he sets foot in this town, you arrest him.
Anything you say, Mr Stoddard.
I'll be tickled to death to...
- What was that? Arrest who?
- Liberty Valance.
Arrest Liberty Val...
You mean Liberty Valance?
Just when I was starting to get my appetite back.
A lot of black-eyes.
Steaks for the Brophy boys with black-eyed peas. Burn 'em.
- They're sober tonight, too.
- Burn four.
Here's the supper for Rance.
- Thank you, Hallie.
- Sit down!
You pop up every time a girl speaks to you.
- You get in the habit.
- Rance, do you think I could?
I mean, grown-up and all?
Could I learn to read?
Sure you can, Hallie.
There's nothing to it.
It'd be... Can you learn to read?!
Why, I can teach you.
A smart girl like you? Of course you can. Do you want to try?
It's awful worrisome not knowing how.
I know the Bible from preacher talk, but it'd be a soul comfort to read it myself.
I'll teach you how. In no time, you'll be reading everything.
Hallie, can I have just one more steak?
One steak on the cuff!
All right, all right.
Excuse me.
- Nora, did you hear the news?
- No.
- Rance'll learn me to read.
- "Teach me to read."
Teach me to read.
I cannot say my ABC in Swedish.
Maybe you can teach me in English.
Sure, Nora.
You'll be my second pupil.
Hal's my first. You'll be my second.
Peter, you hear that? Peter!
Well, pilgrim, I see you're still protecting the ladies.
Tom, look at you.
You're all dressed up.
- It's Saturday night.
- Don't you look handsome?
I brought you a little present.
Prettiest cactus rose
I ever did see.
It's a beauty. Look at it, Nora.
- Should look nice in your garden.
- But it should go in now...
- I'll be pleased to plant that.
- Thank you, Pompey.
The Hash outfit just arrived.
Burn eight.
- Not too close to the ocotillo bush.
- Yes, ma'am.
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."
You're a persistent cuss, pilgrim.
You really aim to hang that up outside?
- That's why I painted it.
- Take some advice, pilgrim.
You put that thing up, you'll have to defend it with a gun, and you ain't exactly the type.
Comin' up.
Thank you.
A girl needs six hands on Saturday night, and it's so hot. Look at me.
Any more colour and you'd be prettier than that cactus rose.
Tom, that's mighty flattering.
Burn me a good, thick one, Pete, meat and potatoes.
- Hello, Kaintuck.
- Evening, Tom.
- Tom.
- Object to company, Mr Peabody?
Not to yours, Tom.
Sit down, sit down.
I suppose you know who's across the street?
Yeah. I hear he sent word on ahead.
He won't like what the town's been saying about him and that hold-up.
How about you, Kaintuck?
- I'd like a st...
- Steak?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well-burnt.
- And d-d-dee...
- Deep-dish apple pie.
- Yeah.
- Coming up.
Mighty nice girl, that Hallie. Mighty pretty.
I agree with you, sir.
Just told her so.
What? Do I hear wedding bells?
When can I print the story?
Don't rush me,
Mr Editor. Don't rush me.
There's your cactus rose.
Sure is pretty.
Thank you, Pompey. It is pretty.
Go and get supper.
Thank you, ma'am.
Look at that. Isn't that the prettiest thing you ever saw?
Very pretty.
- Did you ever see a real rose?
- No.
But someday if they dam the river, we'll have water and all kinds of flowers.
When you finish the dishes, will you help wait tables?
- Sure.
- Washing dishes is enough for him.
- A man waiting on tables?!
- No, I'd be glad to help.
- Be glad to.
- I thought we was busy.
These steaks look done just right for us.
You cowhands ain't in no hurry to eat, are you?
Well, I am!
I guess we could do with another drink.
That's right neighbourly of you, partner.
Especially after all the lies
I hear folks been saying about Liberty Valance.
Wait a minute!
One of Mamma's pies for Tom.
Lookee at the new waitress.
That's my steak, Valance.
You heard him, dude. Pick it up.
- No!
- Pilgrim, hold it.
I said you, Valance. You pick it up.
- Three against one, Doniphon.
- My boy Pompey in the kitchen door.
I'll get it, Liberty.
I said you, Liberty. You pick it up.
What's the matter?
Everybody here kill-crazy? Here!
There! There!
Now, it's picked up!
Why don't you get yourself a fresh steak on me?
Show's over for now.
Try it, Liberty. Just try it.
Get out!
I wonder what scared him off.
You know what!
The spectacle of law and order here, rising up from the gravy and the potatoes.
All right, you made your point.
The gun scared him off.
Pompey's gun, your gun, Tom.
Why did you interfere? He tripped me.
It was my steak.
And you would have killed him for it, or he would have killed you over one measly steak!
- That's why I picked it up!
- Thanks for saving my life, pilgrim.
That isn't why I did it!
Nobody fights my battles.
Rance, I'm sorry.
I'm not in the habit of eating my steak off the floor.
Well, cool off, pilgrim.
It's all over. Nobody got hurt.
It's not all over, and everybody here knows it. He'll be back.
He will, but not after me.
After you, pilgrim.
And you can't shoot back with a law book.
What Peabody's saying is, if you want to stay healthy, there's two ways to do it.
Buy a gun or leave the territory, is that what he meant?
- That's it, pilgrim.
- By golly...
I'd hate to see you go.
You're news, Mr Stoddard, and you've been news ever since you hit town.
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings out there.
I'll tell you what.
You decide to stick around, and I'll let you hang this outside the newspaper office rent-free, for as long as it lasts.
No. The first time
Liberty rides into town, he'll shoot it to pieces, and the whole newspaper office.
- How about that, Mr Peabody?
- Well, that'd be news.
I accept your offer, Mr Peabody.
How about letting me hang that up tomorrow?
- Tomorrow? Well, of course.
- Thank you.
Why not?
I'm staying, and I'm not buying a gun either.
Good luck, pilgrim.
Hallie,
I'll be out of town for a while, north of the Picketwire, horse-trading.
Goodbye, Tom.
And take note of what goes on around town, because by the time I get back, there won't be no newspaper to read it in.
- Well, any news?
- Hansons had a baby, eight pounds.
- But not twins?
- Not twins.
I got this list of voters for you.
There are 37 new registrations over last year, and not one needed a lawyer.
37? By golly!
If we can only get them to vote, maybe we can handle those cattle barons from across the Picketwire.
- Did you write this, Mr Peabody?
- Yeah.
- This is great.
- You like it?
This thing's just great.
As my old boss,
Horace Greeley, used to say, we'll tear their hearts out.
I'll be right there.
Let me have this.
I'll use it in class.
Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late.
A teacher should never be late for class. Take your seats.
Quite a turnout this morning.
We have more pupils every day.
- Morning, Marshal. How you feeling?
- Just fine, fine.
- Your head cold?
- No, no. I have a...
Excuse me. I just wanted to see how Julietta was doing.
- Julietta's doing fine.
- Gracias, señor.
How's the rest of my family doing in reading?
Hallie's in charge of the kindergarten.
Hallie, why don't you run through the ABCs?
All right, you ready?
One, two, three.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P
Q, R, S and T, U, V
W, X and Y and Z
Now I know my ABCs
Tell me what you think of me
That was just fine, just fine.
Well, I see a couple more new pupils back there.
Highpockets, Kaintuck, you fellas really serious about readin'?
Go on. Stand up. Tell him.
Well, Miss Hallie, she talked such a right smart argument to the Lazy "J", the boss of the Lazy "J".
He just up and told all the hands to cut the cards to see who come to school, and I lost.
I see. We'll try.
Good morning, Mr Carruthers.
Good morning. Caught him playing hookey again, fishing.
Catch anything, Herbert?
- No, sir. They weren't biting.
- That's too bad.
- Ain't you gonna whop him?
- He's too big.
For the benefit of those of you just starting...
None of us in here smoke,
Mr Carruthers. Thank you.
For those of you who have just started,
I might explain to you that we've begun the school by studying about our country, and how it's governed.
Now, let's see. Well, Nora...
Would you tell the class what you've learned about the United States?
The United States is a republic, and a republic is a state in which the people are the boss.
That means us.
And if the big shots in Washington don't do like we want, we don't vote for them, by golly, no more.
- Any more!
- Any more.
That's fine, Nora. That's just fine.
Now, I wonder if anybody in class remembers what the basic law of the land is called.
You remember I told you it had to be added to and changed sometimes, by things called amendments.
Does anybody remember?
Julietta, your hand's always up.
Pompey, you try this one.
It was writ by Thomas Jefferson of Virginia.
- "Was written", Pompey.
- Written by Thomas Jefferson.
- He called it the Constitution.
- Declaration of Independence.
It begun with the words...
"We hold these truths to be..."
- Self-evident.
- Let him alone, Charlie.
- "Self-evident, that..."
- "That all men are created equal."
- That's fine, Pompey.
- I knew that, but I plumb forgot it.
A lot of people forget that part.
You did just fine, Pompey.
- Thank you.
- This law also states that governing power rests with the electorate.
That means you, that means the people.
And you exercise this power through the vote. Yes?
Con permiso, los gentlemen's?
Well, Hallie?
Go right ahead, Hallie.
Here is the best textbook in the world. It's an honest newspaper.
This is the "Shinbone Star,"
Dutton Peabody, Editor in Chief.
And reading this ought to bring home to everybody the importance of using that vote.
Now, the headlines say:
"Cattlemen fight statehood.
Small homesteaders in danger."
It says clearly that if big ranchers north of the Picketwire River win their fight to keep this territory in open reign, then all your truck farms and your corn, the small shopkeepers and everything, your kids' future, it will all be all over, be gone!
And they call upon you, in this article, they call upon you to unite behind a real strong delegate and carry this fight to Washington if necessary.
Hello, Tom.
Welcome back. You want to join us?
I'm looking for Pompey.
I've been away three weeks, and there's no sashes or doors in yet.
Why have you been wasting time here?
Get to work. Your schooling's over.
Don't get rough with Pompey.
He's entitled to a...
What I got to say to you will be a whole lot rougher.
The good editor here has written some noble words, and you read 'em good, but if you put that paper out, the streets of Shinbone will be running with blood.
Why are you against this, you of all people?
Aren't there more votes south of the Picketwire than north?
That's right, but votes won't stand up against guns.
Guns? What guns, Tom?
You think Valance stays away from here cos he's scared of you?
He's recruiting hired guns for the big ranchers.
- Sí, papacito?
- Take the little ones home.
Come on.
Hallie, it would be a good idea if you dismissed class.
- Dismiss class?
- Go on. Dismiss them, please.
Class dismissed! Same time tomorrow.
You get to the store.
It could get worse than the sheep wars.
You think they'll start something here?
It's already started. Valance and his men crossed the river yesterday, killed a couple of sodbusters, old man Holiday and his son.
You know that for a fact?
I do. They tried to bushwhack me, unfortunately for one of them.
- You putting that in your newspaper?
- It's news, and I'm a newspaperman.
Print that, he'll kill you sure as hell.
You think they'll come here, Tom?
They'll be here, tomorrow or the next day according to how much who-hit-John they consume, but election day, pilgrim, you can depend on it. They'll be here.
Hallie, go where you belong. I don't want you in no shooting gallery.
Now, you listen to me, Tom Doniphon.
What I do and where I go isn't your business. You don't own me.
Like I said, Hallie, you're awful pretty when you get mad.
Rance. After all you've taught us, how can you say we should knuckle under now?
You heard what Tom said.
When force threatens, talk's no good any more.
Hallie, go find Tom and make it up to him.
He's only trying to protect you.
Better let him go, Hallie.
Why? Where's he going?
He's going to need all the practice he can get.
Practice? What are you talking about?
I might as well let you know.
When he came in with me,
I let him have a gun of mine.
He's been going out in the country twice a week practising ever since.
You mean he's going to face up to Liberty Valance? Rance?
That's the only way I figure it.
He never discussed it.
He just keeps on practising.
Tom! Tom Doniphon!
Hey, professor.
Where you going?
- I want to talk to you at my place.
- Tom, I'm going...
Step down, pilgrim. Take a look.
All right, Tom, what are you trying to tell me?
I'm telling you that Hallie's my girl.
I'm building that room and porch for her for when we get married.
Tom, I guess everybody pretty much takes that for granted.
Everybody except Hallie, maybe you.
That's a damn lie, and you know it.
Why did she come to me fretting herself sick because you were going to get killed facing up to Liberty Valance?
- I never told her.
- Peabody did.
I think you're bluffing.
I'm not bluffing about anything.
Wait a minute, Tom. What?
Pompey, bring two or three of those paint cans.
- You have a gun, right?
- Yes.
Get it.
Come on.
All right, gunslinger.
Hit that can.
Pretty far.
- Pilgrim, you got to cock it.
- I forgot.
Balance it light in your hand and don't jerk the trigger. Squeeze.
You don't have to coach me.
Pompey, bring me those cans.
Give me that thing.
I'll show you how easy it is.
Take these cans.
Put them on those three posts.
Go ahead.
That's it. That first post.
- There?
- That's right.
Not there! On the far post.
That's right.
Now put that last one in the middle.
Pilgrim.
I hate tricks, pilgrim, but that's what you're up against with Valance.
He's almost as fast as I am.
I don't like tricks myself, so that makes us even.
Pilgrim, you forgot your popgun.
I got you, Lyde. Ruf McMard.
Highpockets. Kaintuck.
Kaintuck! Leave the jug.
I am so proud of him.
Dutton Peabody exercising his franchise.
- Dutton Peabody.
- Ransom Stoddard.
Rance, we'll need you for some of that legal stuff later.
"Ransom Stoddard, Attorney at Law."
Check.
- Peter Ericson, American citizen.
- Go on in, Pete.
- See you for supper, Pete?
- Yeah.
- Tom, look, we need a statehood!
- I agree.
Herbert? You're too young to vote.
Back to school.
Greetings. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me.
- I'll have the usual.
- Bar's closed.
The bar is closed, Mr Editor, during voting.
You can blame your lawyer friend.
He says that's one of the fundamental laws of democracy, no exception.
No exceptions for the working press?
That's carrying democracy too far.
A small beer.
Bar's closed.
Give me that bung starter.
All right. Settle down!
Sit down, everybody!
Come on. Settle down.
Since our legal authority closed the bar on us,
I propose that Ransom Stoddard,
Attorney at Law, come up here and run this meeting.
- I second the motion.
- I third it.
Ransom. There he is. There he is.
All right. All right. All right.
All right, now, if you want,
I can show you the rules.
The meeting will come to order.
Settle down please.
Mr Peabody, would you keep a record of the meeting?
Rance, please. There are other men...
Give me a drink.
- Bar's closed.
- Just a beer!
- Bar's closed.
- A beer's not drinking!
- Before we start...
- Sit down, Doctor, please?
I have a pencil right here.
Thank you.
You all know why we're here.
We're here to elect two delegates, because a growing population south of the Picketwire entitles us to two.
These two delegates will represent us in the territorial convention for statehood.
You know the issue.
The cattle interests want to keep this territory an open range.
No!
Ruled by their high-handed ideas, whatever they are.
And we - that means everybody in this room - we're for statehood!
We want statehood, because it means the protection of farms and fences.
It means schools for our children and progress for the future!
Just sit down, please.
Now we'll proceed with the nominations.
You can nominate as many as you like, and in order to show you how this procedure works,
I'll leave the chair temporarily.
That's parliamentary law.
You can do that.
I'll step out of the chair, and I'll make the first nomination.
I'd like to nominate a man I think is the only man in Shinbone who has the right qualifications to lead us in our fight for statehood.
I could stand here talking about him all day, but I know everybody here could do the same.
I don't think that's necessary.
I nominate Tom Doniphon.
Come on, sit down. Sit down.
Stop sucking on that cigar and put that pencil away.
- I refuse the nomination.
- You can't refuse now.
Yes I can, because I got other plans, personal plans.
Mr Attorney, go on with your meeting.
You don't live south of the Picketwire. You can't vote.
I live where I hang my hat.
Come on, move! Out of the way!
Hashslinger, why are you standing there so high and mighty?
He's running this here meeting, or hadn't you heard?
The whole shebang.
I'd like to nominate the chairman,
Mr Ransom Stoddard, as delegate to the territorial convention.
Wait a minute.
And I second that nomination, not only because he knows law, but because he throws a good punch.
Now listen, all you sodbusters, you hard-rock farmers.
- I aim to be the delegate.
- You don't live south.
Floyd, say your piece like I said.
I nominate
Liberty Valance for delegate.
- I second the nomination.
- Move the nominations be closed.
Now wait a minute. That ain't exactly legal, is it, Mr Attorney?
We need two good delegates to Capitol City, Valance,
Two honest men.
We've got one in you, Mr Stoddard.
- You looking for trouble, Doniphon?
- You helping me find some?
- You heard my motion, dude!
- All right. Put his name down.
- Liberty Valance, address unknown.
- Have I got a right to speak?
- Go ahead, Highpockets.
- Then what about Mr Peabody?
He can read and write and runs the newspaper.
Yeah, and when he's drinking, why, he can talk the ears off of a w-wooden Indian.
I second the motion.
No, you don't. No!
I'm a newspaperman, not a politician.
No, politicians are my meat!
I build them up. I tear them down.
But I wouldn't be one.
I couldn't be one.
- It would destroy me! Give me a...
- Bar's closed.
Good people of Shinbone,
I'm your conscience.
I'm the still, small voice that thunders in the night.
I'm your watchdog that howls against the wolves.
I'm your Father confessor!
- What else am I?
- Town drunk?
- Dutton Peabody. Write it down.
- I move the nominations be closed.
- I second the motion.
- All in favour?
Now we'll proceed with the election.
You sodbusters are a brave bunch when you're together, but don't vote any way now that you'll regret later when you're alone.
Those in favour of Ransom Stoddard as delegate, raise your hands.
All those in favour of Liberty
Valance, raise your hands.
All those in favour of Dutton
Peabody, raise your hands.
- Let's get you a drink.
- The bar's closed.
According to Mr Stoddard, the bar's closed.
- Anything further on the election?
- Legally, the election's finished.
Then the bar is open.
That vote don't mean a thing.
Stay out of this.
He's been hiding behind your gun long enough.
You got a choice, dishwasher.
Either you leave town, or tonight be on that street alone.
You be there, and don't make us come and get you.
Well, he called it plain.
Too bad you didn't come to me sooner with that gun.
Pilgrim. Come full dark, Pompey will be at the Swedes' place with a buckboard.
Why don't you leave town?
Thanks.
"Liberty Valance defeated."
D-E-F-E-E... T-E-D?
The unsteady hand betrays.
What's the matter, Mr Peabody?
Are you afraid?
The answer is indub... yes.
No courage left.
Well, courage can be purchased at yon tavern.
But have we credit?
That is the question. Have we credit?
Well, credit is cheap.
Wait for me, old servant of the public wheel.
Our shining hour is yet to come.
As for you, Horace Greeley, go west, old man, and grow young with the country.
Don't do that, Mr Peabody.
Why are you out here?
Don't you know that everybody is supposed to get off the street?
My inalienable right, the pursuit of happiness.
Sure, but it don't go to the saloon.
Liberty Valance is back there.
You should hear what he's swearing to do to Rance.
And he ain't leaving you out, either.
Go in and let the Mexican fill that.
But I doubt if my credit is good with these Spanish-American gentlemen.
Sure, it is. He's my wife's step-uncle by her sister's marriage.
But would you say something nice about me in your paper?
My dear friend, Link Appleyard?
The fearless, fighting marshal of the west?
Your name will go down in history with Buffalo Bill.
Mr Peabody's drunker than a skunk over in that Mexican joint.
He ain't eating tonight.
He "isn't" eating tonight, remember?
Isn't, ain't, what difference does it make?
Ain't going to be no school anymore with you leaving tonight.
Good evening, folks. Mr Rance,
I have the buckboard out here.
I'll be waiting for you if you need me.
Go, Rance. Go now, while you can.
Nora and Hallie can finish the dishes.
Go. Please go.
I owe you for three days' room and board.
I want to square my account. I want to square my account before I go.
And those in England now asleep shall think themselves accursed.
They were not here whilst any lives that fought with us on St Crispin's Day.
But when the blast, the blast of war, blows in our ears and we summon up...
Liberty Valance. And his vermidons!
Liberty Valance taking liberties with the liberty of the press?
- Had your supper yet, Peabody?
- My supper?
No. That's a splendid idea.
- You can start by eating this.
- That's a poor joke, Liberty.
Eat it!
Eat it!
He's dead.
Mr Peabody.
Rance? Rance Stoddard?
- Mr Peabody.
- Let's get him up.
- Where's Doc Willoughby?
- Still in the saloon.
Go get him.
Rance? Rance!
I sure told that Liberty Valance about the freedom of the press.
Marshal?
Marshal... you tell Liberty Valance
I'll be outside.
- Pompey!
- Miss Hallie?
- Where's Mr Tom?
- Down the road.
Get him!
Rance is out front with a gun!
Yes, ma'am.
You've heard of Gettysburg. 240...
Doc, Mr Peabody's awful hurt.
He needs you at his office.
What's wrong?
Somebody have an accident?
So that's it. Another one of your accidents, Valance?
I'm waiting for the day when they'll call me for you.
Paid in advance.
$10 into the cans.
Liberty, what you did to Mr Peabody, ain't that enough?
Ain't that enough what, Mr Marshal?
You all know that Rance Stoddard couldn't shoot the hat off his head with a gun in his hand.
You mean, he's got a gun in his hand?
I'm calling you, Valance.
Kings and threes.
Good hand, but not good enough.
An ace is an ace. Thank you.
If you gun him down, it'll just be pure murder.
Well, Mr Professor,
I thought you left town.
Why are you out here?
I'm waiting for Liberty Valance.
Why doesn't he come out?
Well, that's none of our business.
You heard him say he had a gun, right?
- I didn't say that!
- That ain't murder.
That's a clean-cut case of self-defence.
You heard him call me out, didn't you?
Now get out of my way.
Hashslinger, are you out here?
I'd say that was Liberty Valance there now. Wouldn't you?
- Yes, I would.
- We be seeing you, Mr Stoddard.
Come closer where I can see you.
Get out of that shadow, dude.
You got two hands, Hashslinger.
Pick it up!
All right, dude... this time, right between the eyes.
Liberty?
Liberty? Liberty!
Hey, Doc! Doc!
Liberty!
It's Liberty! He's hurt!
It's Liberty!
- Whisky, quick.
- Here, sir.
Dead.
Rance, if it had been you instead of Valance, I would...
Oh, no, Hallie. Hallie...
I can't help it.
This feels so guilty.
I didn't want you to run away.
I wanted you to stay.
He might... I'm sorry.
- Forgive me.
- Hallie.
Hallie, please don't.
Hallie.
I'm sorry I got here too late,
Hallie.
You got yourself out of that fix real handy.
I'll be around.
- Tom! Liberty...
- I know.
He wasn't going to kill him, just nick him a little.
He was just gonna make a pass.
You saw that!
- That lawyer shot him in cold blood!
- Now, that ain't the way.
It was murder! Pure murder!
And I say if the marshal don't put Stoddard in jail, we ought to take care of him ourselves!
- I say we ought to hang him!
- That's right! Hang him!
Give him a rope! Let him swing!
Can't a man get a drink around this town in peace?
- No one's bothering you, Doniphon.
- You are!
Marshal!
Why are you paid? Drag this scum out.
You heard him.
Kaintuck and Highpockets,
- I deputise you to give a hand.
- Hand me that bung st... That's it.
Tell those ranchers north of the
Picketwire that hired you that me, Link Appleyard, run you out of town, and I'll do it again if you ever come back!
- Now look, Pompey, you know I...
- Who says he can't?
- Pour yourself a drink, Pompey.
- I don't drink no drams, Mr Tom.
I said take a drink.
No. We got a mare in foal and horses to feed and water. Come on home.
Home...
Home sweet home.
You're right, Pompey.
We got plenty to do at home.
Well, what are they paying you guys for? Play!
Be merry! Sing!
Leave me be!
Mr Tom!
The horses, Pompey. The horses.
Hello! How are you?
- You made it on your own feet!
- Yeah! Thanks to Doc Willoughby.
- Here. Let me pin this on you.
- That's him.
- Well, this must be Ransom Stoddard.
- Rance, this is Handy Strong.
How do you do, sir?
It's quite a city here.
It's not much according to your eastern standards, but that railroad station there leads straight to Washington.
Come on, Rance.
Order! Order!
Order! Order!
Order! Order! Quiet!
Order! Quiet!
The roll call having been completed and the delegates recognised and seated, this session of the territorial convention is hereby declared open.
Order!
Order!
Mr Chairman.
The chair recognises the Honourable
Major Cassius Starbuckle... soldier, jurist, and statesman.
Mr Chairman, fellow delegates... ladies... and gentlemen,
I came here with a carefully prepared speech, but this is no time for oratory.
Let me speak to you from the heart.
I come before you to place in nomination the name of a man more qualified than any other to represent you in Washington.
You ill-advised.
You poorly counselled.
Fly not in the face of heaven's handiwork.
Join with us in supporting the man who for five terms in Congress has kept this great territory inviolate.
I nominate for the territorial delegate to the Congress of the United States the Right Honourable
Custis Buck Langhorne.
Order! Order!
Now that you got your rope on him, hang the horse thief!
Order! Order!
This is a convention, not a rodeo, Langhorne!
Mr Chairman! Mr Chairman!
The chair recognises its old friend... that distinguished member of the fourth estate... founder, owner, publisher and editor of the "Shinbone Star"...
Mr Dutton Peabody, Esquire.
Thank you, Mr Chairman, for those kind words, but tell them the whole truth... founder, owner, editor and I also sweep out the place.
Fellow delegates, like all of you,
I've listened in awe and admiration to the magnificent oratory of the Honourable
Major Cassius Starbuckle... the cattlemen's mouthpiece.
The lowing herd is still with us.
But, seriously, under the spell of his eloquence,
I could see once again the vast herd of buffalo and savage redskin roaming our beautiful territory with no law to trammel them except the law of survival, the law of the tomahawk and the bow and arrow.
And then, with the westward march of our nation, came the pioneer and the buffalo hunter, the adventurous and the bold.
The boldest of these were the cattlemen, who seized the wide-open range for their own personal domain, and their law was the law of the hired gun.
But now, today have come the railroads and the people.
The steady, hard-working citizens, the homesteader, the shopkeeper, the builder of cities.
We need roads to join those cities, dams to store up the waters of the Picketwire, and we need statehood to protect the rights of every man and woman, however humble.
How do we get it? I'll tell you how.
We get it by placing our votes behind one man.
One man!
And we have that man with us here.
He is a man who came to us not packing a gun, but carrying instead a bag of law books.
Yes. He is a lawyer and a teacher.
The first west of the rosy buttes.
But more important, he's a man who has come to be known throughout this territory in the last few weeks as a great champion of law and order.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I nominate as your delegate and mine, to the Congress at Washington, the Honourable Ransom Stoddard!
Let's have order!
Get going, Starbuckle.
Thank you, Mr Chairman. Thank you.
Well...
I see this demonstration, but I can't believe my eyes.
Is it possible that such a representative body of honest, hard-working Americans can endorse a candidate for the Congress of our beloved country whose only claim to the office is that he killed a man.
Do you call Liberty Valance a man?!
Order! Order!
Hear me out!
Who is this Ransom Stoddard?
And what qualifications has he that entitle him to aspire to such great office?
We are told he's a lawyer, an attorney at law, an officer of the court.
Yes, but what kind of lawyer?
A man who usurps the function of both judge and jury and takes the law into his own hand.
Quiet! Quiet!
What other qualifications has he, then?
The blood on his hands?
The hidden gun beneath his coat?
The bullet-riddled body of an honest citizen?
Honest citizen?! Liberty Valance?
You fool! Liberty Valance, an honest citizen?
Is this your fearless champion of law and order?
- Mr Chairman!
- The mark of Cain is on this man, and the mark of Cain will be on all of us if we send him with bloodstained hands to walk the hallowed halls of government...
...where Washington...
- Mr Chairman!
- Mr Chairman!
- Order! Order!
...yes, and Lincoln still live, immortals in the memory of man.
Mr Chairman!
Rance! Rance!
Order! Order!
Pilgrim.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home, Tom.
I'm going back east where I belong.
Valance couldn't make you run away.
What is it now, your conscience?
Isn't it enough to kill a man, without trying to build a life on it?
You talk too much, think too much.
Besides, you didn't kill Liberty Valance.
- What?
- Think back, pilgrim.
Valance came out of the saloon.
You were walking toward him when he fired his first shot.
Remember?
Pompey.
All right, dude.
This time... right between the eyes.
But...
Tom, why did you do it?
Cold-blooded murder, but I can live with it.
Hallie's happy. She wanted you alive.
- But you saved my life!
- I wish I hadn't.
Hallie's your girl now.
Go on back in there and take that nomination.
You taught her how to read and write.
Now give her something to read and write about!
Well, you know the rest of it.
I went to Washington, and we won statehood.
I became the first governor.
Three terms as governor, two terms in the Senate,
Ambassador to the Court of St James, back again to the Senate, and a man who, with the snap of his fingers, could be the next vice president of the United States.
You're not going to use the story,
Mr Scott?
No, sir.
This is the west, sir.
When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.
He's right, Rance.
It's getting late, Hallie.
We'll keep in touch with you,
Pompey. I promise.
- But, Mr Rance...
- Pork chop money.
Hallie...
Hallie, would you be too sorry if once I get the new irrigation bill through, would you be too sorry if we just up and left Washington?
I sort of have a hankering to come back here to live.
- Maybe open up a law office.
- Rance...
If you knew how often
I'd dreamed of it.
My roots are here.
I guess my heart is here.
Yes, let's come back.
Look at it.
It was once a wilderness.
Now it's a garden. Aren't you proud?
Hallie, who put the cactus roses on Tom's coffin?
I did.
Here, I got a brand-new spittoon...
Cuspidor, Hallie. and Luke the engineer's got a full head of steam in this tar bucket.
We'll make 25 miles an hour or bust a boiler trying.
And we wired ahead to Junction City.
They'll hold the Express.
In two days and two nights, you'll be in Washington.
Thank you, Jason.
I'm going to write a letter to the officials of this railroad and thank them for their kindness and for going to all this trouble.
You think nothing of it.
Nothing's too good for the man who shot Liberty Valance.
Template
That's your man.
- Draw your pay.
- You wanted him broken.
Yeah, but not ruined.
Now, get out of here.
Mr. Marshall.
Ever heard of a J.W. Grant?
He needs you. Urgent.
My husband.
Hurry. Hurry.
Please, hurry.
Get out of here.
Baby!
It's nice to see you.
I'm Joe Grant.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Ehrengard.
Got your telegram, Mr. Grant.
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sharp.
Yeah. Me too, Lizzie.
Mr. Grant, I'm your local bank representative.
As per your instructions, this box contains...
Thank you for coming, Mr. Fardan.
The receipt, Mr. Grant.
Exactly $100,000 in gold coins.
Not a coin larger than $50.
That's quite an unusual request.
Thank you. Move out.
Mr. Grant. Slow freight ahead.
- Sidetrack it.
- You should count the money.
- Didn't you count it?
- Well, yes, of course, but...
Thank you.
Henry "Rico" Fardan. Virginia Military
Academy, Philippine campaign...
...Cuba with Roosevelt's Rough
Riders. Married a Mexican woman.
No children. Wife deceased.
Joined Pancho Villa as weapons expert and tactician.
Your hair was darker then.
My heart was lighter then.
Left Villa's forces, June, 1915.
A year of wildcatting and prospecting.
Results: Negative.
Now demonstrating automatic weapons. Salary: $40 a week.
Hans Ehrengard. Ex-cavalryman, cattle boss, wrangler...
...bull-whacker, packmaster.
Jacob Sharp. Specialist with rifle, rope and longbow.
Most dependable scout and tracker in the territory.
Any objections to working with a Negro?
What's the job, Mr. Grant?
How well do you know him?
- Well enough.
- What's your feeling toward him?
I have the highest respect for him...
...as a soldier.
Last week, your respected soldier kidnapped my wife.
His ransom note.
Your job:
A mission of mercy.
Raza. Captain Jesus Raza.
Jesus.
What a name for the bloodiest cutthroat in Mexico.
Mrs. Grant is a prisoner about 100 miles across this desert.
A hellhole. For Raza, a fortress.
He was born in that desert.
He and his men know every ravine, every rock, every cliff.
It'd take a battalion at least a month.
But a few daring men...
...specialists, led by you...
...could do it in one bold, swift stroke.
Why not? You're fluent in Spanish.
You know the terrain.
You know Raza.
How he thinks and reacts.
- I know you can do it.
- I don't think so, Mr. Grant.
One thousand dollars a man going in.
If you bring her back safe and sound...
...another 9000 dollars for each of you.
- How many men does Raza have?
- Pasqual?
Last month, 150, maybe. Now?
- If I were you, I'd pay the ransom.
- There it is.
One hundred thousand dollars in gold coins, as requested by Raza.
Will that guarantee that she won't be killed? You know Raza.
Say we were lucky enough to get there.
How do we get your wife out? Safely?
Gentlemen, I don't know where else to turn.
- What we really need is an equalizer.
- Name it.
A dynamiter with a delicate touch to blow out a candle...
...without denting the candleholder.
- Who?
Him.
Arrange to have that man at the train where we pick up the horses.
- Where is he?
- Not far.
- Get the details.
- In jail.
- In jail?
- He says that $700 will bail him out.
But is he dependable?
Can he be trusted?
I trust him.
Then you've got him.
- Rico, buddy, I don't deserve you.
- I agree.
I can understand you getting into a crap game and losing $700...
...but how'd you lose your pants?
- In a lady's bedroom.
Trying to raise the cash.
Almost had it made too.
You realise people are the only animals who make love face to face?
He's all yours.
Thanks. Again.
You could have telegraphed the money yesterday.
Yesterday, I didn't have the money.
What's the proposition?
You won't lose your pants.
Your life, maybe, but... what's that?
Hardly anything at all.
- Well?
- Nice animals.
- Picked by Mr. Ortega.
- You can depend on them.
This one is Mrs. Grant's favourite.
Bred for speed.
He'll need a lot more than that for this job.
- You'll have to make them do.
- Mr. Grant...
...I can make them go, but I can't make them do.
$100,000 for a wife?
She must be a lot of woman.
Certain women have a way of changing some boys into men...
...and some men back into boys.
- That's a woman worth saving.
- Where are we going?
- The Painted Mountains.
That's right.
- You want us to go back to Mexico?
- This time strictly for cash.
- What's the deal?
- $10,000 per man, for nine days' work.
More money than we ever realised out of all our schemes put together.
No detours!
I made us a contract. All the way.
- They know who took the woman?
- Raza.
Our Raza? A kidnapper?
- Grant's got a ransom note to prove it.
- Well, I'll be damned.
Most of us are.
Last week Mrs. Grant went riding.
Across the border.
She was born in Mexico.
I suppose she got lonely for it.
By the time we were alarmed, the note of ransom arrived.
You'll want to know how she looks.
Those were taken four years ago on our wedding day.
I guess I'm not much good without her.
Not anymore.
- What part of the hacienda is she kept?
- I'd only be guessing.
We have to know.
- The goat-keeper must know.
- Is he still there?
- What goat-keeper?
- By name, Padillia. Eduardo Padillia.
He was devoted to Mrs. Grant.
Twice a day he brought her goat's milk. It was almost a ritual.
By this, he will know you have my blessing.
Like myself, he would give his life for the señora.
When you cross under that bridge, you're in Mexico.
You'll leave as soon as it's dark.
It's safer to travel by night, rest by day.
Bring her back to me.
Please.
We've been following the same tracks.
- Mexicans.
- How many horses?
Eight. More likely 10.
- How long ago?
- Couple hours.
- Which way they headed?
- Same as us, south. Only, circling.
Now, why should they circle?
Raza's men?
- Why not?
- This far north?
That's a good question.
Could be anybody. Even friendly.
- Could be.
- Jake, shag them. Look them over.
But just look.
We'll camp at Dead Man's Canyon.
Spot us by the Painted Hills.
I'll find you.
Rico. You know something?
Me and Raza are the two most corruptible bums.
- We'd do most anything for money.
- And have.
But not kidnapping.
That's not our trade.
Why did Raza pick Grant's wife to kidnap?
Company. Eight.
Next bend up ahead.
- Last night you saw tracks for 10.
- That's right.
- Any cover?
- Both sides.
Cut out your two horses and the dynamite mule.
- Maybe they're just passing.
- If so, they'll ride in single file.
The leader in front, and they'll palaver.
If it's trouble, they'll come as a group.
If the leader takes his hat off and passes it across to cover his gun...
...let go, fast.
- Bill, you take the point.
- They got bolt-action rifles.
- Same setup as Durango?
- Yeah. Why not?
- They're here.
- They're here.
Good morning, friends.
Good morning.
They're Americans.
- You got lost?
- Just looking for a place to camp.
What you got in those packs, boss?
Gold?
You got more gold in your teeth.
He says I've got more gold in my teeth. How funny!
- It's very dangerous around here.
- Oh, that so?
Sure. Many bandits hide in these mountains.
Very bad men.
They steal from anybody.
- Especially gringos.
- In that case, we'd better keep moving.
Go with God.
- That makes 10.
- That's right.
Shoot the horse. Shoot him!
- Bury them deep.
- Nine more of their horses are still left.
- You gonna shoot them too?
- We can't spare the food and water.
You can turn them loose.
- What's so funny?
- People.
We just killed 10 men.
Nobody bats an eye.
- When it comes to a stupid animal...
- But harmless.
Nothing's harmless in the desert, unless it's dead.
Want to face another pack of Raza's men?
- They'll head south, to camp.
- They'll head to the river, north.
Suppose they follow us? What then?
Then shoot them.
All right. Cut them loose.
God almighty.
I've known heat before, but this is...
I hate the desert.
It's got no pity.
Jake.
- Did he take his salt?
- I'll see that he gets some.
Let him sleep. You too.
How they taking it?
They'll be all right.
You'd better scout ahead tonight.
Now, beyond that ridge,
20 miles of salt flats.
Then 10 more of sand.
220 degrees south by southwest.
Our next layover, Coyote Pass.
The cemetery of nameless men.
We buried some fine friends there.
And some fine enemies.
That was a fine battle.
Outnumbered, outgunned, and still we held that pass.
Yeah, but who cares now?
Or even remembers?
Now, take that ruckus this morning.
A year ago, those men would be fighting federals instead of gringos.
- We were lucky.
- We were also stiffed.
They had us spotted back where we picked up their trail.
- Why did they sucker us into this spot?
- You're leery about the setup too. So?
Amigo, three days' ride from
Coyote Pass is another graveyard.
But instead of dead heroes, they buried gold bullion.
Two million in Spanish gold.
Melted down into beautiful bars.
Waiting for us.
We don't have to fight Raza to get it.
- It's not the reason you took this job.
- Got a better reason?
Our word. We gave our word to bring the woman back.
My word to Grant ain't worth a plugged nickel.
You gave your word to me.
Drink?
Thanks.
Yeah, takes getting used to.
Broiling by day. Freezing at night.
Alkali dust choking your body.
Who lives here long enough to get used to it?
Men, tempered like steel, a tough breed.
Men who've learned how to endure.
- Like you and Dolworth.
- Oh, no.
Men like Raza.
I wonder how long that's been there.
About an hour or so.
Dolworth put it there.
That means everything's all clear.
An upside-down cross means danger.
- Could've been put there by anybody.
- That's the idea.
Good morning, friend.
- Dolworth?
- Yeah.
- How many more?
- Three.
No guns.
- We that close to Raza?
- Could be.
At least I made out with a fine pistol.
We sure got lucky with this gringo, eh?
No wonder my mother kicked me out of the house!
- A bottle.
- You'd even frighten the dead!
Don't get carried away.
The bottle.
Where are your friends, amigo?
Here have a drink.
These shoes will be mine if they fit.
- Hey, don't I know you?
- Well, from here you look like me.
- Why you come to this place?
- You'll laugh.
It is not proper to laugh at a man who is about to die.
I came because I'm crazy about your tequila.
And I like your women.
See? You laugh.
What a funny guy, huh?
I'm gonna ask again.
Where are your friends?
I told you. I always travel alone.
It is a sacrilege to die with a lie in your teeth.
See?
Those horses and six more come back to us.
But where are the men who ride them?
I don't think you kill 10 men by yourself, buddy.
Hold it!
Stop!
I wouldn't do that.
My friend would die of a terrible headache. And so would you.
And so would you.
So wouldn't it be more sensible if we both kept our heads, huh?
Put down your gun.
If I did that, how do I know that you would still be friendly?
Do I gotta kill you to prove I like you?
Your gun, mister.
That's why I like this fool, because he's intelligent.
- Behave!
- Behave. Let it drop.
That's why I like this one, because he's so intelligent.
Thattaboy.
Come on, buddy.
Let it go already.
He's a good man after all.
You have to get over this habit of losing your pants.
- It's not dignified.
- It's draughty too.
- Don't worry. This time I'll do it.
- This time we need them.
You all right?
Makes you wonder how we ever beat the Indians.
Thanks.
Interesting pass.
You should see it from upside down.
If we hightail it out of here in a hurry, that doorway could save us hours.
It's the same shortcut for Raza.
Not if you rig it so we slam that door in his face.
Yeah?
I'll take the first watch.
If it isn't hot, it's cold.
If it isn't cold, it's raining.
How bad is that horse?
- Not too good. No bottom.
- We could all do with a rest.
Yeah.
- A shave would be a relief.
- So would a bath.
Might as well throw in a woman.
Any size, any age, any colour.
Any woman.
Mr. D...
...whatever got a loving man like you in the dynamite business?
I'll tell you. I was born with a powerful passion to create.
I can't write, I can't paint,
I can't make up a song.
- So you explode things.
- That's how the world was born.
Biggest damn explosion ever.
Dynamite in the hands of a fool means death.
In this case it could mean life. Ours.
If we're lucky...
...and get back to this rattrap, it'll be touch-and-go.
All you gotta do is light this fuse.
You got 10 seconds to run like hell.
And then dynamite, not faith, will move that mountain into this pass.
Peace, brother.
That track is the main line to Mexico City.
According to this, Grant's railroad spur branches off three miles up.
Beyond those hills... the hacienda.
Supply train.
- Government troops.
- Well, look here.
Raza.
Throw it!
Pull it!
- How are you, man?
- Good, chief. Thank you.
- Are they all Reds?
- Yes, Captain, they all are.
Well, you know what to do.
- Justice.
- Shut up!
The men on that train are Colorados.
Expert marksmen.
Also expert at torture.
Years ago, they burned and looted a town of 3000 people.
When they finished, 40 were left.
Fardan's wife was one of the lucky 40.
"Why are you a revolutionary?"
They asked her.
"To rid the world of scum like you," she said.
They stripped her naked...
...ran her through the cactus until her flesh was...
The other 39 rebels watched her die...
...and did nothing.
Just watched.
What were Americans doing in a Mexican revolution?
Maybe there's only one revolution, since the beginning.
The good guys against the bad guys.
The question is:
Who are the good guys?
- Juanito, to the north and south, okay?
- Got it.
About 60 horses, four burros.
Two machine guns from the train.
Jake.
Keep those horses quiet.
Get some more from the other side.
Hurry.
You rode well today, honey.
Perfectly.
Beautiful.
- That Mrs. Grant?
- That is a soldier.
Lieutenant Si Si Chiquita.
Now, there's a woman worth a ransom.
She never says no.
Before you blow a gasket, think you can blow the water tower?
- How do you want it?
- Like it was hit with a French 75.
Mrs. Grant could be there.
- Seems the only likely place.
- The trouble is, we gotta be dead sure.
When we make our move, there won't be time for guessing.
Coming through the gate.
- Morning. How's the wife and kids?
- Very good, very good.
Wow, there's a lot of you here.
Anybody see any cows?
No.
It's a cinch that milk didn't come from the breast of a tin can.
Our friend, the goat-keeper.
Good morning, sir.
- What is your name?
- Eduardo Padillia, at your service.
Do you recognise this?
Friends of Mr. Ortega.
That's right.
The milk that you brought to the hacienda this morning...
Who was that for?
- Who drinks it?
- Many people.
Anybody special?
The lady. Señora Grant.
She live in that room? You're sure?
- You have seen her?
- I know her from when she was born.
Her mother was dry. She was raised on the milk of my goats.
- Is she well?
- Very well, considering.
We have come to help her.
Blessed be the Lord.
May God repay you. May God...
Raza has to expect one of two things:
A messenger with a ransom...
...or an attack from the federales.
We've gotta make him think we're the Mexican army.
- The four of us?
- A whole battalion.
Now, how do the federales start an attack? Artillery.
This is our battery of field guns.
First you hit him here. French 75s.
Then here, here, here.
Carefully avoiding Mrs. Grant.
- When they run to defend the...
- We rescue Little Red Riding Hood.
We can't fight our way in.
Diversion is our only chance.
Well?
Rico, buddy, I got one of my feelings.
Something's dicey about this.
Let's pull out.
If you can deliver this dynamite with split-second timing...
...we can pull this job off.
Mr. D?
I guess we just gotta get lucky.
Jacob, this stick of dynamite weighs exactly four ounces.
If you taped that to an arrow, how far could you shoot it?
And hit the mark.
I don't like it.
- We get it wrong?
- Relax.
The stuff you're handling is safe.
These beaded sticks are trickier.
It's the heat.
Makes them sweat. Nitro.
When they're dry and cool, they're safe and obedient.
We'll leave these sweaty ones behind.
Ventilate them. Cool them.
Then maybe they'll behave.
I don't know whether it's me or the dynamite...
...that's doing all that sweating.
Four men against so many.
How will you save the señora?
- I don't know yet.
- When will it happen?
- Tomorrow. Maybe the next day.
- Not before?
- There's much to prepare.
- Speak plainly, señor.
Am I your prisoner?
I want to help the señora.
But you make me feel unworthy.
Trouble!
Show us if you're worthy.
Go greet them.
And remember,
I speak your language.
They don't give good milk if they're skinny.
What happened, old man?
Any news?
- Talk!
- Same as always. Very hot weather.
- Have you seen anyone around here?
- No.
A gringo maybe?
- Gringo?
- Yeah, a gringo.
Are you sure?
They killed and buried ten of our men.
They found the men we buried in the canyon.
Am I worthy?
If I were you, Jacob, I wouldn't use any of these for firewood.
Excuse me. I am ready to leave.
- Shall I tell the señora of your coming?
- No.
- She might behave differently.
- I understand.
By tomorrow, God willing, the señora will be safe.
Until later, then.
So you let him go.
They expect him to bring the milk.
To hell with the milk.
- What must he do to prove himself?
- He proved nothing.
He knew if he said a wrong word, he'd be shot.
What were we to do?
Watch him all night, and tomorrow?
When we go do the job, then what?
We take him with us? Tie him up?
Or were you planning killing him?
I wouldn't put that past you.
- I don't like it.
- All right.
We do the job tonight, as planned.
This fuse burns for 10 seconds.
Three seconds for flight of arrow?
- About.
- Once you light the fuse...
...you've got seven seconds to shoot.
- Clear.
Start shooting as soon as the water tower blows.
These are your targets.
That's your position.
- I have 4:17.
- Set them at 4:30.
We should have an hour before dawn.
How much time do you need?
I'll be ready by 5:00. This fuse will burn for half-hour exactly.
- Fireworks start at 5:30 sharp.
- Any questions?
- Machine gun over the lady's room?
- My job. Anything else?
Let's go to work.
Listen to me!
- Who are you looking for?
- Raza.
There are things that...
Captain.
What?
Carlos, I won't take long.
I know.
- How was it?
- Okay.
- Carlos?
- Yeah?
- Want some tequila?
- Oh, good. Thank you, friend.
Where are you all going?
I'm right here.
Good night.
- See the woman?
- Yes.
- Talk to her yet?
- No.
- How much time we got?
- About eight minutes.
- Listen to me!
- Go on.
- Go to hell!
- You go to hell!
I don't give a shit!
That Chiquita, she can lick a whole regiment...
...but she can't dance a lick.
You. Go away!
Amigo, we've been had.
Let's get the hell out of here.
- No.
- No!
Do exactly as I said.
The Mrs.
Speak only what I told you.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Call them.
Rico. All clear.
By the way, I forgot to bring your wooden cross...
...your upside-down cross.
Cease fire!
Cease fire!
You're going to injure the Mrs.
- Cease fire!
- Cease fire!
They're afraid to hit the woman.
Your position is hopeless.
Put down your weapons.
Get up.
Come on, baby. Let's go.
Don't shoot.
Release the woman!
Release her!
Shoot.
Do as I say.
Shoot.
One shot from you, I'll kill her.
Get your men off that train.
Move!
Now!
Let's go! Outside.
Three against four. What happened?
- Feels like a busted rib.
- You're lucky.
The bullet went clean through.
Your hands are filthy.
What's it to you if he lives or dies?
If he lives, we'll have to slow down.
That'll give Raza a chance to catch up.
She'll work to keep him alive, all right.
Yes?
Just wondering.
What makes you worth $100,000?
Go to hell.
Yes, ma'am.
I'm on my way.
Thanks.
How is he?
He will never reach the border.
None of you.
You have no chance. You never did.
We knew everything.
From the moment you set foot in Mexico. Even before.
From the day my husband sent for you.
Mr. Ortega.
He said he would give his life for you.
For me, not my husband.
For Raza. For the revolution.
From the loyal Ortega to the devoted goat-keeper, to the faithful wife...
...at the mercy of a brutal kidnapper.
That's one hell of a rigged parlay.
I was not kidnapped.
The old badger game.
Shakedown partners, bed partners.
Cosy.
Raza and I grew up together.
I am born there.
When it's the hacienda of my father, when Raza is only a stable boy.
We are lovers long before
Mr. Joe Grant buys the place.
When my father lies dying, he says:
"Mr. Joe Grant wants you for his wife."
"You will become Dona Grant, a fine lady. That is my wish."
Here, a wish is a command.
But I'm very young and very foolish.
I tell Mr. Joe Grant
I cannot marry to him.
I love another man.
Very romantic, no?
Your husband sent you clothes.
I offer you a better bargain than I got.
Four lives. Yours, if you let me go.
You better change before we start back.
It'll be a long ride on your bare bottom.
Raza!
- How much time have we got?
- None.
Get her out. Get her out!
Mario!
Drink it.
See anything?
Sand.
They'll be along.
- How would they know which way?
- Raza will know.
You should have let me finish him.
Why didn't you kill him?
You let Raza live.
Why?
Shall I tell you?
You are simpatico. No man was more loyal to the revolution than you.
I fought like any other man.
Loyalty such as yours, that comes only from devotion to a cause.
That same fire burns in Raza. That is why you could not see him murdered.
He is a thief, trying to steal
100,000 dollars.
You are a whore cheating on your husband.
My husband stole millions from this land, our land.
If we can keep the revolution alive, with that money, for just a day...
...then I'll steal and cheat, and whore...
...and anything else that must be done.
You laugh. But you believed in the revolution once.
What else inspired you to fight for us?
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you.
I got inspired one day in May, 1911, in El Paso.
It started suddenly. Shooting, yelling, bombs going across the Rio Grande.
Everybody ran to see what the ruckus was about. Me too.
From the top of freight cars we saw across the river.
The Maderistas were taking Juarez.
The revolution had busted wide open.
It was beautiful.
The next thing I know I was across the border shooting...
...with everybody and yelling,
"Viva Mexico."
A month later I was blowing up trains for Villa.
Yes?
That's it.
Nothing more?
Not even money?
Promised, never paid.
But you stayed. You and this one.
And fought for six years, the worst years.
It's not our war anymore, Mrs. Grant.
Him, I understand.
An adventurer without principles.
But you?
Change your clothes.
We're leaving.
Raza says you and he were good friends.
- That's right.
- And yet, you would have killed him.
That's right.
For money.
That's right.
For as much money, would you let me go?
- How long since you had a woman?
- Too long.
You want me?
My price is high.
Freedom.
I might say yes now and later, no.
I trust you.
I trust you too.
You heard the man. We're leaving.
Finished.
Try a little salt, ma'am.
Make you feel better.
Ma'am...
Sorry about your horse, ma'am.
- You know something, Rico?
- Here.
That's a lot of woman there.
Beautiful. Classy. And guts.
Hard enough to kill you, and soft enough to change you.
Reminds me of another Maria.
Yours.
Amigo, don't con me.
She's going back. If I have to do it alone, she's going back.
That's what I wanted to hear you say.
What is on your mind besides
100-proof women, 90-proof whisky...
...and 14-carat gold?
Amigo...
...you just wrote my epitaph.
- How many men?
- Raza and six. Pushing hard.
Moving out.
To make the border, we gotta be out in three hours.
We got an hour, maybe less.
You have lost.
Win or lose, here and now.
Bottleneck like this, one of us might hold them off.
- One of us.
- If he plays it cool.
Hit and run. Stall and retreat.
Ehrengard needs help.
That's Jake's job.
The woman has to be watched.
That's your job.
- Buying the time we need is my job.
- Whoa, amigo. Slow down.
Let's keep this professional. Your job is to make good our contract.
To deliver the goods. All the way.
That's your job.
I got 9000 bucks coming.
In hard cash, please.
Take my horse.
You'll need him if Raza gets past me.
Bill.
See you.
Jake.
How are you going to make it back?
Well, how were you?
No!
Come on! Go on!
Sons of bitches.
Show your faces, bastards.
- Fierro!
- I got one of them.
Francisco!
Where are they?
Speak, man. Their positions!
Rico!
Fierro, is he finished?
Not yet, baby.
Baby.
Amigo.
So you are the one they left to die, huh?
Where did the bullet bite you?
In the ass.
You?
Another two inches, mamacita.
Could you spare one more cigarro?
Why, sure.
Come and get it.
Hey, Fierro!
- You want tobacco?
- Smoking is bad for the health.
How do you come to this dirty business?
The usual.
Money.
Everything is as usual.
I need guns and bullets, as usual.
The war goes badly, as usual.
Only you...
...you are not as usual.
Chiquita!
How's your love life?
Terrific.
You want some?
Don't you ever say no?
- Never.
- Anybody?
Everybody!
You know, of course, one of us must die.
Maybe both of us.
To die for money is foolish.
To die for a woman is more foolish.
Any woman, even her.
How long you think to hold us here?
Oh, a couple of hours.
Then what happens here won't matter.
She'll be Mrs. Joe Grant again.
But that will change nothing.
She is my woman.
Before. Now. Always.
Nothing is for always.
Except death.
Ask Fierro. Ask Francisco.
Ask those in the cemetery of nameless men.
- They died for what they believed.
- The revolution?
When the shooting stops and the dead buried...
...and the politicians take over, it all adds up to one thing, a lost cause.
So...
You want perfection or nothing.
You're too romantic, compadre.
La Revolucion is like a great love affair.
In the beginning, she is a goddess.
A holy cause. But every love affair has a terrible enemy.
Time.
We see her as she is.
La Revolucion is not a goddess, but a whore.
She was never pure, never saintly, never perfect.
So we run away.
Find another lover, another cause.
Quick, sordid affairs.
Lust, but no love.
Passion, but no compassion.
Without love...
...without a cause, we are nothing.
We stay because we believe.
We leave because we are disillusioned.
We come back because we are lost.
We die because we are committed.
You and I together.
I to the front.
- I will go first.
- Do as I say, woman!
A woman he will not shoot.
Jesus!
Hello, baby.
Long time since I hear "baby."
Hey, you ever find...
...that damn gold mine?
I am not lucky today.
But you're beautiful.
Querido, baby.
We had some fine times together.
Terrific.
Give us a kiss.
Mrs. Grant, let's go.
As long as we're not pressed for time.
Well, in a few minutes she'll be home.
Be nice if Bill was here for the payoff.
Be nice if he was here alive.
But stalling around won't make it so.
A cloud of dust. Could be Mr. Raza.
Could be most anything.
Even a whirling dervish.
That, gentlemen, is the whirlingest dervish of them all.
- Never thought he'd get out alive.
- And that, gentlemen...
...calls for a celebration.
What's that supposed to mean?
Rico, buddy, this will come as a shock to both of us.
- I'm a born sucker for love.
- That bullet knocked your brains out.
Or let some in.
What happened back there?
What changed your mind?
I found out what makes a woman worth 100,000 dollars.
You expect me to turn her loose?
Turn her loose? After all we've been through together?
After all the blood it's cost?
Hell, no!
You made a contract to kidnap a wife for Mr. J.W. Grant.
Now, let's collect that ransom.
Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. Thank you.
Nicked you a bit, did they?
Help yourself.
- I'll get Mrs. Grant.
- That isn't necessary.
Hooper! Escort these men into town. See they're paid in full.
Charge hotel bills, whisky bills, girl bills, all bills. Anything. On me.
You must be anxious to get a hot bath...
...so it'll have to be adios and muchas gracias.
- A hot bath.
- Why? Is it Saturday?
You did your job and earned a bust-out. Those are orders.
The contract is not complete until...
...Mrs. Grant is delivered safe and sound.
- The code of the profession?
- Something like that.
Very well. I hereby declare our contract satisfactorily concluded.
Not yet. Mrs. Grant...
Thank you.
Maria!
- Hooper.
- Yes, sir.
Kill him.
No, no.
You haven't earned the right to kill him.
If it's not too much, I want privacy.
- Joseph!
- Not now.
There is nothing to hide.
They know everything.
Everything.
You're back again.
Nothing else matters.
I will run away again. That matters.
You're my wife. You belong to me.
I belong here.
- With him?
- With him.
I'd rather see you dead.
You're coming with me!
You're going home!
- No!
- Yes!
Gentlemen, you heard our employer.
The lady's going home.
Did you think J.W. Grant was stupid enough to pay that ransom?
Certainly not.
There was no kidnapping.
Right, Mr. Grant?
- Right, Mr. Grant?
- That is none of your business.
Wrong, Mr. Grant.
We made a contract to save a lady from a nasty old kidnapper.
Who turns out to be you.
We both made a bad deal, Mr. Grant.
You lose a wife, and we lose
10,000 dollars apiece.
You bastard!
Yes, sir.
In my case, an accident of birth.
But you, sir, you're a self-made man.
- Thanks for the lift.
- Where will you look?
I don't know, but if I find a pink Cadillac, he'll be around somewhere.
So long.
- Who's that?
- It's Lon.
I'm making chilli, but if you want breakfast I'll come out.
No, thanks. You seen my uncle Hud?
I chicken-fried him a steak last night about seven. Haven't seen him since.
All right.
Daisy, I'm taking two doughnuts.
OK, honey, just leave a dime on the counter.
All right.
It's 26 after 6 on a Thursday, it's
71 degrees in the good old summertime
on the Bobby Don Brewer Show.
Must have had quite a brawl in here.
I had Hud in here last night is what I had.
Sure looks it.
Mr Larker.
- Hey there, Mr Larker!
- Hey there, Lon!
- You gonna rodeo this year?
- I ain't looking to get stepped on.
- Why're you in town this early?
- Trying to run down Hud.
Didn't I see his big Cadillac parked down the street?
Pretty sure I did.
I wouldn't disturb him if I was you.
I ain't dying to, but I've been told to get him.
Hud?
Hud!
Honcho, I just hope for your sake that this house is on fire.
I'm sorry, but we got trouble at the ranch.
You got trouble right here.
I was getting nicely tucked in, you come tiptoeing through the tulips.
Granddad wants you and he said right now.
He said right now?
Do you think it would be all right with my daddy if I buttoned up my shirt?
Oh, come on, will you?
You got me out of the wrong side of bed this morning. Don't snap at my heels.
I'm liable to turn around and bite you.
Thank you, honey.
Hey, hi, Joe.
Which one of you two's coming out of my house at six in the morning?
I asked you a question.
Which one, damn it?
I hate to have to tell you as it's my own nephew, but it's this snot-nosed kid.
I'll kill that little punk.
Wait a minute!
You got diabetes.
I'll handle this for you.
I can do it myself. Out of my way.
Now, Joe, you can't afford to get worked up, buddy boy.
I'll lower his temperature some,
I promise you.
All right, hot shot. We're going to finish this discussion behind the woodshed.
Thanks a whole lot!
Relax, you can charge a stud fee by the time that story gets around.
If I'm still alive.
I could've gotten hurt back there.
So could I. Ain't it lucky you were handy?
- You should take me along as a regular.
- Pace would kill you, sonny.
What's so important my daddy has to drag me back on my day off?
- He wants to ask your advice.
- Ask me?
He hasn't asked me about anything in 15 years.
I just work out there from the shoulders down myself.
Can you make it all day, after last night?
I ain't 100 years old like him.
I don't need a week's sleep to be fresh.
He can't help being an old man.
You sure drive this thing.
That'll be Hud.
Parked right in my flower bed.
- Good morning, Hud.
- Morning.
I'm sorry to cut into your time off.
Lonnie, close that screen door.
The house is still standing, you're drinking coffee as usual, why push the panic button?
We come up with a dead heifer in the night.
You dragged me back here for a dead cow?
I'm worried about this one. She wasn't cut or crippled-looking. No swelling.
- Any Johnson grass around?
- No.
This may be something
I ought to know about.
José and Jesse are keeping off the buzzards.
Stay out of those berries, they're for the pie.
Let's not stand around.
I got things to do.
Watch that cigarette ash, it's going in the pot.
I'll go bring the pick-up around.
How come you always run over my zinnias?
I've been trying to get them to come up.
- Don't plant 'em where I park.
- You're cheerful.
Missy, your job is to keep house, not worry about my disposition.
Frying pan's still on. Want eggs?
Or did you have breakfast in bed?
Nope, we hadn't quite gotten around to breakfast.
- Morning, boys.
- Mr Bannon.
Pretty hard to keep them birds away.
Had to use a flashlight all night.
Look at them buzzards. They'll be back.
You couldn't scare 'em off with artillery.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
They keep the country clean.
Besides, there's a law against killing buzzards.
I always say the law was meant to be interpreted in a lenient manner.
I try to do that. Sometimes I lean to one side of it, sometimes the other.
I don't like to break the law.
Well, she ain't gonna sit up and tell us herself.
What do you think, Hud?
I don't know. She looks clean to me.
Something killed her.
I'll call the state vet. He might know.
This is our land.
I don't want government men on it.
Any time, any place. This ain't nothing.
Let the buzzards have her.
No, I don't believe I will.
I'll call the government man and ask him to take a look.
Bring someone in to tell you how to run your business, just don't ask my opinion.
I'd like you and Lon to stay out here for a while.
I'll take these boys back with me so they can snooze a little.
Lon, you take that water bag so you won't parch.
Why don't you sit with our sick friend?
I got a healthy one in town that won't wait.
It's a good thing you showed up.
We blew a tyre and I gotta get this stuff back.
- Need help, Jesse?
- I'm all right, Hud, thanks.
You think your hand would fall off if you opened the door?
- Did you pick up my beer?
- Two six-packs. Enough till tomorrow.
- Keeping count on me?
- I keep tripping over those empties.
Somebody smells of Chanel No. 5.
It isn't me. I can't afford it.
You sure weren't riding the range this afternoon.
- I sure wasn't.
- No.
I wish I knew where some girls get the time.
By the time I finish scrubbing the floor, cleaning the bathtub, hanging clothes...
- They just drop everything, honey.
- I suppose it does beat housework.
- Want an orange? I'll peel it for you.
- No, thanks.
Look, it says "Florida" on it.
We grow 'em right here in Texas and they send them in from Florida.
That makes sense, doesn't it?
Yeah.
The checker at the A and P market says you're seeing Truman Peters' wife.
Is that what he says?
He says she got a bad temper. Her maid quit because she hollers so much.
Well, our maid's gonna get canned
'cause she's talking too much.
- You want a Fig Newton?
- No.
Just leave a little something for dinner, will you?
You still eating bread?
After steak and flour gravy, hominy, fried okra and onions, and hot rolls?
May have looked a lot, but it melted away.
- Hud didn't want dinner?
- He's prettying up. He'll eat later.
What's for dessert?
You think a freezer-full of peach ice cream would do?
I've been waiting all winter for those Alberta peaches.
That's what you've been waiting for?
How about those peachy pin-ups you hide with your socks?
That's private. Stay out of there.
I'm a girl.
They don't do a thing for me.
I'll dish up the ice cream on the porch.
It's cooler.
That'll be fine, Alma.
Go on, before you wet your didy.
Alma!
Yeah?
Give me a clean white shirt.
You're big with "please" and "thank you".
Please get off your lazy butt and get me a clean shirt. Thank you.
- Had trouble getting the lipstick out.
- Let's try yours. It might wash out easier.
- Let's not.
- You ain't getting any younger.
- What are you saving it for?
- Tabs are in the collar.
- Hear the whippoorwill?
- I think there's two of 'em.
I've never seen one of those birds.
All you do is hear 'em calling.
What are you thinking about, Lon?
I don't know. Just looking up ahead, I guess. To what's coming.
Thinking about your worries and ambitions?
Yeah, that and having a car of my own to tear around in. And girls.
I expect you'll get your share of what's good. A boy like you deserves it.
It's getting late.
My daddy sure looks like his collar was choking him.
- Those were his Sunday best.
- I don't remember him any.
I do.
You don't carry a picture of Hud, do you?
No, I don't.
But he's your son, same as my dad was.
Yep, he is.
- What are you holding against him?
- He knows and you don't need to.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Ain't you having any?
- I'm trying to lose a couple of pounds.
I'll do those dishes later.
I've got to get off these feet.
- Kitchen's your department, Alma.
- Seen enough of it for today.
Are you planning on going back to town tonight?
I didn't get washed up to sit on the porch.
I'd like you to be back here before morning. The vet'll be here early.
All right. It's pretty good. Peachy.
You can't get much air through this nylon.
You ought to wear a sarong, like in the South Seas.
Oh, yeah, that would be a lot of laughs.
You're half native already.
I've never seen you in shoes.
I wore 'em once.
To get married in. White satin pumps.
I don't have 'em any more.
Or the man, either.
I'm going to get into town.
Alma, you want to blow some foam off some beer?
No, thanks.
I'm going to get up out of this swing.
Set some biscuits. Go to bed.
I'll settle for half that action.
I'll go with you, Hud.
What you got lined up, sport?
A SnoCone or something?
No, I just thought
I'd catch a ride with you, that's all.
All right, come on, let's make tracks.
- Did you need me, Granddad?
- No, you go on.
Just be careful.
You drive, sport.
- What was that all about?
- I'll tell you someday when I'm drunk.
Gig this thing a little, will you?
- It's a lonesome old night, isn't it?
- Ain't they all?
I love that sound. Goes right through me.
Scares the hell out of the cattle.
- Know what trains make me think of?
- I've a strong feeling you'll tell me.
I guess I just like 'em, that's all.
Keys.
Well, golly!
Look at that Las Vegas saddle.
You couldn't lift that on a horse with a crane.
- It is pretty noisy.
- Where are you going?
- Just tagging along.
- Not with me.
Go tie on a couple of Dr Pepper's.
I'll see ya.
- Hi, Mr Kirby.
- Hi.
- Read that one?
- Yeah, twice.
- About the best book you ever had.
- Pretty steamy, ain't it?
I don't know. People seem a lot like the ones I see.
Did you read the part where the sergeant gets her for the first time?
Yeah, I read that part.
I sure have seen an awful lot of you for one night.
I'm just headed for the square, is all.
Where're you headed?
Just to keep you up to date,
I'm going to Mrs Ruby Fletcher's house.
I don't think that's a house you've heard much about.
I've heard some. I am out of my three-cornered pants, you know.
- I have been for some time.
- How old are you?
A fast seventeen? Boy, when I was...
When I was your age,
I couldn't get enough of anything.
That was the summer you were born.
Your ma died. And your daddy was feeling a little wild about things.
We bought us a '27 Chevy.
Kept it tied together with bailing wire, hit every honky-tonk in the country.
I don't know which we run the hardest, that car or them country girls, came to them dances.
Boy, we do-se-doed and chased a lot of girlish butts that summer.
I wouldn't mind going that route myself.
Come on along.
No, I don't think so.
All right.
Hey, wake up. Come on, Lonnie.
Open your eyes.
- You gonna stay here till dinner?
- What do you want?
I want you to get up. I can't stay here wrassling with you all morning.
- Why not? I like it.
- I bet. That's enough. Now, get up.
- Can't do that, Alma.
- Are you sleeping in the raw again?
There's pyjamas in there.
How come you're not using them?
- They strangle me.
- Come on.
- What do you sleep in?
- In my own room, with the door locked.
- Ever wear any shorty things?
- What kind of question is that?
- Just wondering.
- Your mind usually run that way?
- It seems to.
- Boys with impure thoughts get acne.
- Did you know that?
- That's all bull.
Keep it up. You'll see.
Hurry up!
The vet's coming this morning.
Let's get away from this stink.
I've got all I need here.
I'm going to ask you to get your cattle together.
All of them.
I'll have to make an inspection.
- Inspection for what?
- For what killed that heifer.
I hope I'm wrong, but I'm afraid you've got the worst kind of trouble.
I think that cow died of foot and mouth disease.
Oh, me. I never thought it would be anything like that.
Let's have it. What are we in for?
Get your herds together.
We'll take some samples.
Bring in a few calves, some horses, infect them artificially, then wait and see what happens.
I'll tell you. They turn up sick, you kill 'em, right?
If the calves turn up sick and the horses don't, it's foot and mouth. We've got to.
The last bad outbreak, the government had to kill 77,000 cattle, plus that many sheep and goats, even 20,000 deer.
It's a terrible thing.
I just bought 20 head of Mexican cows down south.
- Could they be the bad ones?
- Could be.
If they were, you'll have to get rid of every cow that's been near them.
You're talking about all the animals I own.
I know I am.
I hope I'm wrong and that it's something else.
So we won't ever have to talk about it again.
Looks like I landed in the wrong place again.
You guys get on, there's some fence to fix.
Man, how about that?
You going to let them shoot your cows on account of a schoolbook disease?
You getting that old, Homer?
I wonder if a long quarantine wouldn't satisfy 'em. Think they'd agree to that?
They don't have to agree to nothing.
They're the law.
You can agree with them till hell freezes over.
But that Mr Burris seemed like a reasonable man.
Think they'd come and liquidate?
Hell, yeah, you got what they say you got.
You've had 24 of my 34 years working for you on this ranch, and, Daddy, you've had top-grade cheap labour.
I've shovelled manure for you.
You've got my calluses. For what?
Your blessings the day you die?
No, damn it.
I want out of this spread what I put into it.
Have you got a proposal, Hud?
Get on the phone and sell every cow you own. They ain't got a chain on you yet.
That's how you'd get out of a tight?
I can ship the whole herd out before they begin the test.
Try and pass bad stuff off on my neighbours who wouldn't know?
You don't know it's bad stuff.
I'll ship 'em up north before the news gets out.
And take a chance on starting an epidemic in the entire country?
This whole country is run on epidemics.
Where've you been?
Epidemics of big business price fixing, crooked TV shows, income-tax finagling, souped-up expense accounts.
How many honest men you know?
Take the sinners from the saints, you're lucky to get Lincoln.
I say let's put our bread into some of that gravy while it is still hot.
You're an unprincipled man, Hud.
Don't let that fuss you.
You've got enough for both of us.
This afternoon's been a regular bitch.
- You out of poop?
- Just having a breather.
Go back to the ranch and grab a nap.
No, I'll hold up my end of it.
Yeah, I guess you would.
Granddad.
I found your longhorns near Idiot Ridge.
Government's gonna have a hard time trying to inspect 'em.
Those big horns'll never go through a chute.
There ain't many left, are there?
No, they're dying out.
I just keep 'em for old times' sake, to remind me of how things was.
Everything we had come from their hides: Our furniture, our ropes, our clothes, our hats.
Granddad, let's turn 'em loose.
No, Lon, that wouldn't be the thing to do.
They gotta go with the rest.
- Granddad.
- Oh, why, thank you, Lon.
I shouldn't have brought you here after the day you put in.
If the picture's any good,
I'll wake up, don't you worry.
Looks like you're the only one who ain't got someone's knee to pinch.
Oh, I think I can stand it.
You wouldn't think they'd pay 65 cents to come here and do it.
They can go up in the hayloft for nothing.
Come on, you miners, '49ers,
let's all join in and sing that old favourite,
Clementine.
Just follow the bouncing ball.
You gonna get your mouth around that?
Gonna try.
- Hi, Hud.
- How are you?
- Is that Truman Peters' wife with Hud?
- I think so.
- Want me to call him over?
- No, just leave him.
Got a half a buck?
Hey, come on back.
You gonna give me the change?
Hey, hey, let's make a party out of this.
This not-too-natural blonde here is Mrs Truman Peters.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Wild Horse Homer Bannon as he used to be known.
And this gangly youth over there is my nephew, Lon.
You may have just noticed, my daddy hasn't asked us to sit down.
He doesn't want to socialise with me.
He's fussy about the company he keeps.
You're a married woman, Lily.
That doesn't go down well with him.
He's a man of high principles.
Doesn't believe in any loose living at all.
Isn't that right?
- Granddad.
- Homer, you OK?
Get me... Get me home, boy.
Roll down that window a little, will you?
That's good. Place back there seemed a little short of air.
Maybe you just got too much sun today.
Well, whatever.
No need to pull such a long face about it.
I feel better now.
When we get home,
I'm going to fix you some Sal Hepatica.
Yeah, that'll settle me right down.
He dropped right off.
He's beginning to look kind of worn out, isn't he?
Sometimes I forget how old he is.
- Guess I just don't want to think about it.
- It's time you started.
I know he's gonna die some day.
I know that much.
He is.
Makes me feel like somebody dumped me into a cold river.
Happens to everybody:
Horses, dogs, men.
Nobody gets out of life alive.
- I'll give you a hand upstairs.
- Lon'll take care of me.
Suit yourself.
Goodnight, Hud.
Thanks for the game, boys. You can have another shot at me next pay-day.
- Got a cigarette?
- Yeah.
Don't keep me on the porch like I'm selling something.
All right, come on in.
- They're a little squashed.
- It's all right. They'll do.
- I see you got things fixed up some.
- I try.
Looks pretty good, except your sweet potato's got the blight.
I can't seem to get one started.
They need love and care like all of us.
I'll keep it in mind.
Could I have a match?
Well, what have we got here?
"Jiffy Portable Hairdryer."
"Triple screen."
Automatic toaster.
You been rustlin'?
I go in for those prize contests.
"How Shinette Shampoo changed my life," in 20 words.
They give free trips to Europe.
I end up with the fountain pens and the binoculars.
Won me a turkey raffle once, but it was fixed.
I got friendly with one of them girls picking the numbers.
It figures.
How much you take the boys for tonight?
Twenty dollars and some change.
- You're a dangerous woman.
- I'm a good poker player.
You're a good housekeeper.
You're a good cook.
You're a good laundress.
- What else are you good at?
- At taking care of myself.
Shouldn't have to, a woman looks like you.
That's what my ex-husband used to tell me, before he took my wallet, my gasoline credit card and left me stranded in a motel in Albuquerque.
What did you do to make him take to the hills? Wear your curlers to bed?
Ed's a gambler.
He's probably up at Vegas or Reno, dealing at night, losing it all back in the daytime.
Man like that sounds no better than a heel.
Aren't you all?
Don't go shooting all the dogs
'cause one's got fleas.
I was married to Ed for six years.
Only thing he was ever good for was scratching my back.
- Still got that itch?
- Off and on.
Let me know when it's bothering you.
We're injecting these cows and horses with specimens taken from your herd.
In three to six days, we should know what we want to know.
Move on in there! Get in that chute!
You all right, Lon?
She kicked you into the fence.
You skint your head a little.
Boy, you caught a lick.
Back to work.
Boys'll be on you for a week, if you quit.
No need to rush him. You all right, Lon?
- You've had it, Fantan.
- Get him to bed.
All right, Jack, back to work.
All this time I thought you was skinny.
You weigh a ton.
I can't seem to get my head on straight.
- I think I'm gonna lose my breakfast.
- Not over me. Hold your fire!
- Sugar! You're white as a sheet.
- Sure, you're getting flour all over me.
- What happened?
- A cow cuddled up to him.
- Shouldn't a doctor look at him?
- Pay five bucks for aspirin? He'll mend.
That's it. I draw the line at bedpans.
Thanks, Hud.
Gold-brick for the rest of the day, just don't stretch it into two.
Here, let's get those boots off.
Cold lemonade.
Here. Oh, come on, they're only lemon seeds.
That better?
You ought to doze off now.
Gee, Alma, you're cool.
You smell of lemon.
- Alma?
- What is it, sugar?
- You're really beautiful.
- Oh, sure I am.
You're one of the best people there ever was. You're good to me.
- In fact, you're good, period.
- You be good, too. Get some sleep.
Morning, Granddad.
- How are you today, Lonnie?
- Good. Real good.
Have I been sawing wood up there!
I slept round the clock.
I feel almost like working.
What have you got for me?
Patch a little fence?
Pull up some weeds?
Work a few calves?
I don't guess we'll do anything much.
No point wasting work until I find out about my cattle.
We'll just roll over and play dead and let 'em shovel dirt in our faces.
If my cattle don't get a clean bill of health, we are just about dead.
Dead broke.
We've bred this beef all our lives to get the best stock in the country.
The government will end up paying four bits on the dollar.
- Poor but honest. That's us.
- We ain't sure. We'll just have to wait.
Don't get sores on your butt doing it.
I could do without that noise, Lon.
Go stretch your legs a little, will you?
Where's that bottle? I had a bottle of Jack Daniel's in that cupboard.
- You drank it.
- When?
Instead of dinner, Wednesday night.
Don't remember.
If you think I drunk it,
I only drink Tokay wine.
And I bet you keep your little finger crooked while you're doing it.
Go stick your head in the water trough and sober up for lunch.
Don't you find me in control of myself?
- I'd hate to see you walk a straight line.
- That's easy.
I don't like sudden passes.
We'll ease into it, then. There's another one coming up on your right.
Don't you ever ask?
Only question I ever ask is, "What time's your husband coming home?"
What's keeping you?
You're over the age of consent.
- Way over.
- Let's untie our shoelaces.
I've been asked with a little more finesse in my time.
Yeah.
I wouldn't want to come on crude.
No, ma'am.
I'll bring you a 2lb box of candy, maybe some perfume.
How about some coloured beads and wampum?
- Whatever it takes to make you trade.
- No, thanks.
I've done my time with one cold-blooded bastard. I'm not looking for another.
It's too late. You already found him.
You hardly touched your plate.
Nothing to do with your cooking.
I just ain't hungry.
- Anything from the vets?
- No, they're taking their time.
I ain't gonna sit around here and stew.
The Kiwanis are waiting.
- Gonna be at that pig scramble?
- Yeah.
See if I can make the Bannons look good for a change.
You honchos want to come, there's room in the cheering section.
They're letting ladies in free tonight.
You just might qualify.
That's the first time Hud asked me to go any place. I wonder why he did.
Lonesome, I imagine.
Trying to scare up a little company.
Lonesome?
He can get more women than anybody.
That ain't necessarily much and it ain't necessarily company.
Women just like to be around something dangerous part of the time.
Even Hud can get lonesome once in a while.
Well, I wouldn't mind watching him chase those squealers.
- Then we'll go on in.
- I'll stay home. I don't like pigs.
Let's give these kids a hand.
Applaud for the kid you liked the best.
That's it, ladies and gentlemen, looks like number ten won it.
You've seen one kind of twisting, you're about to see another.
We've got ten men gonna tie themselves in knots trying to catch the fastest pigs you've ever seen.
The first to catch his pig and bring it here is the winner.
If you boys will come on in, we'll get this started. Come on.
- You got the pigs ready?
- You bet.
Come on, let's go then.
You're outside there.
Wag, pull your hat off. Let's go.
When I say three we'll go.
One, two, three, go!
It looks like we got a winner,
Hud Bannon.
Hud, that pig looks about as dirty as you do.
Towel?
Thank you for turning out.
We hope you enjoyed yourselves.
We look forward to seeing you next year at the contest.
Wish I could still get around the way you do.
You sure churn up that dust.
I want to kick up more before the night's over. Anybody interested?
That's enough excitement for me,
I guess.
I'll be getting back. Lon?
It's still kinda early.
I might stick around with Hud for a while.
I'll leave the door open for you.
Hitch up your pants. I'll get cleaned up, then I'll buy you a drink.
- Want to put a little kick in that?
- Sure. OK.
Come on, I can handle it.
Whoa! Whoa!
- Pretty girl.
- Don't let me cramp you.
- I wouldn't make any move at her.
- Why not? You ain't nailed down.
- That's a woman and a half.
- You're a pretty good-looking kid.
Damp down that cowlick and button your collar, you might just make out.
I wouldn't mind driving her the long way home.
Yeah, you ought to take a crack at that.
Get all the good you can out of 17,
'cause it sure wears out in a hurry.
Trouble is, I've got to like a girl a lot before I can work up to anything.
- I mean like her as a person.
- You're a regular idealist.
- What's wrong with that?
- I don't know. I ain't never tried it.
- I suppose you think I'm a jerk.
- What do you care what I think?
This is probably gonna hand you a big laugh... but I do.
You have another little drink.
And I'll have another little drink.
Then maybe we can work up some real family feeling here.
Well, I think I'll shove some change in that juke.
- Hi.
- What are you gawking at?
- I ain't gawking.
- I don't like fresh kids.
- Nobody's getting fresh.
- I'll take you out and loosen your teeth.
Are you having words with this youngster?
- I'm about to put him into the hospital.
- Is that so?
- Has he been bothering you?
- He ain't bothering me.
It's her he's bothering.
You didn't offer him any encouragement, young lady?
- No.
- That's funny.
I was sitting there and I got a little encouraged.
- Maybe it's the way you move.
- All right, I'll take you instead.
I don't want to be hoggish.
Lon, you want a piece?
That's one hell of a night!
I could do that about six times a week.
- You don't win them all, you know?
- I would if you were backing me.
That would make quite a combination.
Nobody'd ever mess with the Bannons.
Felt like old times there for a while.
- Your daddy and I used to take them on.
- He must've been a good old boy.
What, Norman? Yeah.
He used to leave his loose change out when I was a kid so I could swipe some.
Let me take a girl from him once in a while like I'd done it on my own.
He was bigger than you and had a bigger wallet, but I tell you, when you ain't being a pain, you remind me of him.
- I do?
- Yeah.
Then how come we don't hit it off so good?
I got short arms.
Never been anybody like old Norman.
Never will be.
He was one way-out boy.
Claimed he could hear the grass grow.
He got me to go to his pasture one night to listen.
After three or four hours nipping away at that bottle to keep the dew off,
I swore I could hear it, too.
That's the night I racked up the car.
Piled up on Samson Creek Bridge.
He died in half an hour.
I didn't even have a mark on me.
I wonder if your daddy's hearing the grass now, growing up over his grave.
That story ought to cool you off some.
It doesn't.
Fantan, either you're soft-hearted or soft-headed. I don't know which.
Hey, Granddad.
He's got you drunk.
What else has he given you a taste for?
- All we had was a couple of drinks.
- Don't remember you being a teetotaller.
I drink. I don't object to his having whiskey.
- Something's eating away at your liver.
- You, Hud. Like always.
- What are you climbing on Hud for?
- You think a lot of Hud?
You think he's a real man?
You're being took in.
Listen to him. He's my daddy, he knows.
I know you. You're smart.
You got your share of guts.
You can talk a man into trusting you, a woman into wanting you.
- I got it made!
- To hear you tell it.
Get it off your chest! What's been griping you is what I done to Norman.
You were drunk and careless of your brother.
You had 15 years to get over it.
That's never been our quarrel.
- The hell it isn't.
- No. I was sick of you long before that.
Well, isn't life full of surprises?
And all along I thought it was
'cause of what I done to my brother.
I took that hard, but I buried it.
All right, what turned you sour on me?
Not that I give a damn.
Just that, Hud. You don't give a damn.
That's all. That's the whole of it.
You still don't get it, do you?
You don't care about people.
You don't give a damn about 'em.
You got all that charm and it makes the youngsters want to be like you.
That's the shame of it
'cause you don't value nothing.
You don't respect nothing.
You keep no check on your appetites.
You live just for yourself and that makes you not fit to live with.
My mama loved me, but she died.
Why pick on Hud, Granddad?
He ain't the only one. Just about everybody around here is like him.
That's no cause for rejoicing, is it?
Little by little, the look of the country changes because of the men we admire.
- I still think you nailed him pretty hard.
- Did I?
Maybe. Old people get as hard as their arteries sometimes.
You're just gonna have to make up your own mind one day about what's right and what's wrong.
Where's that cotton-picking housekeeper of ours? I want something to eat.
- It's late. She's asleep.
- Ain't that just keen.
Paying her good money to sleep when I'm starving to death.
- I could fry you up an egg sandwich.
- Forget it.
Get out of here.
I can't think with you standing around.
I'm gonna knock some people on their tails. You might be one of 'em.
Go on, get out of here!
- Boy, they mean trouble.
- I wish I'd stayed out of bull riding.
From the look of them, you ain't riding very far.
Thanks, buddy.
I'd better go check my gear.
Never mind your gear, check your head.
That bull's gonna eat you up.
- How are you, Hotrod?
- Hi, Hud.
Get a good seat for the show?
They're getting two bucks for those bleachers over there.
Be my guest.
- This is ten dollars, Hud.
- It's good. I didn't print it.
Well, thank you.
Stick with me.
Your jeans'll be full of change.
How come?
Well, I'll tell you.
Put on a clean white shirt and saw a lawyer.
There's a law that says when old folks can't cut the mustard any more, you can make 'em let go, whether they like it or not.
What are you pulling on Granddad now?
Something pretty raw, kid.
Yeah, it sounds like it.
Take your dough. I don't want it.
Don't look down your nose at me.
I'm gonna get old, too.
I don't aim to end up on county relief with a bowl of soup and two cigarettes a day, if I behave myself.
I want what I worked for.
I got a right to it.
You know something, Honcho?
You don't look out for yourself, the only helping hand you'll ever get is when they lower the box.
Now, you have fun, you hear?
- Hud?
- You're up awful late.
- I got a lot on my mind.
- Come on in. Take a load off your feet.
- Talk to the vet today?
- Yes, but I didn't get a lot of information.
Did you expect to?
Government man wants you to know something, he'll call.
They're watching the test animals pretty close, but nothing's showed up yet.
- Hud.
- Yes, sir?
What's this tricky deal you're up to?
Lon tells me you're gonna pull the rug out from under me.
That's right.
I ain't got all the rough edges ironed out yet, but I can give you an idea.
The main thing is you, old man.
You're too old to make the grade.
Whether they liquidate us or not when this thing is over, you just better get out of my way.
What in hell do you mean?
When an old man buys a bunch of sick
Mexican cows it means he's over the hill.
You've got the incompetence, Daddy, and Hotrod's too young to take things over.
So I get the court to appoint me guardian of your property. I don't know.
If I don't get it one way, I'll get it another.
Why, you're badly mistaken about all this.
I'll be the only one to run this ranch while I'm alive.
After that, you may get part of it.
I don't know. But you can't get control of this place. No way in the world.
Don't go making any bets on that.
Maybe I treated you too hard.
I made some mistakes.
A man don't always do what's right.
Daddy, you ain't never been wrong.
You been handing out the ten tablets of law from whatever hill you could find since I was a kid.
Shape up or ship out. That's the way you run things around here.
Wild-eyed Homer Bannon, passing out scripture and verse like you wrote it yourself.
So, I just naturally had to go bad, in the face of so much good.
Hud, how'd a man like you come to be a son to me?
Oh, that's easy.
I wasn't on your doorstep.
I wasn't found in no bulrushes.
You got the same feelings below your belt as any other man.
That's how you got stuck with me for a son, like it or not.
He was just so drunk, Alma.
Did he hurt you?
Should I take you to town, get you a doctor?
Go on out of here.
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you, Hud.
Climb off it. You've been wanting to do the same thing.
Always been wanting to wallow her.
Yeah, I've been wanting to do it.
But not mean like you.
Here comes Mr Burris.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- You've missed breakfast.
- Thanks, but I've eaten.
I guess you've got something to tell us or you wouldn't be here.
- I guess the tests are done.
- Yes, sir, they're done.
You got the worst thing you could have.
- And there's no cure at all?
- Not that we know of.
Like lightning. Don't hurt you till it hits.
Your cows are public enemies now. We got to handle this fast before it spreads.
What do I do? Drive them into a pit and shoot 'em? I can't abide that.
- It's terrible, even to think about.
- I've seen it during the Depression.
It's a sight worse to see than to think about.
You're getting older.
You can afford to slow down.
The rest won't hurt your grass any.
You might even sell a few oil leases.
My daddy thinks oil is something you stick in your salad dressing.
If there's oil down there, you can get it sucked up after I'm under there with it.
But I don't like it.
There'll be no holes punched in this land while I'm here.
They ain't gonna come in and grade no roads so the wind can blow me away.
What's oil to me?
What can I do with a bunch of oil wells?
I can't ride out every day and prowl amongst 'em like I can my cattle.
I can't breed 'em or tend 'em or rope 'em or chase 'em or nothing.
I can't feel a smidgen of pride in 'em
'cause they ain't none of my doing.
There's money in it.
I don't want that kind of money.
I want mine to come from something that keeps a man doing for himself.
We're much obliged to you for coming out in person to tell us.
Start shooting.
It didn't take long.
It don't take long to kill things.
Not like it does to grow.
There's a couple we missed. I'll get 'em.
Where do you think you're going?
Finish this job. Somebody needs to.
Well, you just close that gate.
I'll kill them two myself, seeing as how I raised 'em.
Something wrong with you, mister?
- There's no guarantee you'll do it.
- He just said he would.
You get in the car.
We'll finish burying those carcasses, then we're leaving.
Mr Bannon can handle the rest of this without us bothering him.
You just get along, Mr Burris.
I know none of this ain't your doing.
You see about the burying and then get that fella off my ranch.
All I can say is, I'm sorry.
I'm sure sorry.
He ain't such a bad fella.
Just got a cruddy job.
Boys, I don't plan to have any work around here for some time.
I can't afford to keep you on till things get better so...
...l'll just have to let you go.
Give me the rifle.
Lord, but I have chased them longhorns many a mile.
I don't know if I can kill 'em.
But I guess I can.
I guess this is the worst thing that ever happened to you.
Oh, I'll get over it.
If my health don't go to failing me.
Lon, you go away someplace.
Well, them old bulls are hard to kill.
Drag 'em away and bury 'em.
Bury 'em quick. Go on.
Did you call about the bus for me?
- Yeah, it leaves at 10.26.
- Can I buy my ticket on it?
Yeah, they said that would be OK.
- I got $200 calf money, if you're short.
- You just keep it.
Well, I'm ready.
I wish you weren't going off and leaving us, Alma.
Look after your grandpa. He's getting old and feeble. He's your job now.
We need you around here. I sure do.
You'll get along just fine.
I wish you'd stay.
I've been all over this country, looking for the exact right place and right people, so once I got stopped,
I wouldn't have to be moving again.
And it just hasn't worked out.
Goodbye, honey.
You take care of yourself.
And don't you be lazy now.
How are you, Pee Wee?
Looks like we're losing a good cook.
Maybe we should've boosted your salary a little.
You ain't letting that little ruckus we had run you off, are you?
As far as I can get on a bus ticket.
Are you claiming I'm the first guy ever stuck his foot in your door?
- No.
- I'm the first that ever got rough, huh?
Well, I'm sorry. That ain't my style.
I don't usually get rough with my women.
Generally don't have to.
- You're rough on everybody.
- So they tell me.
You know, it would've happened eventually without the rough house.
You look pretty good without your shirt on.
Sight of that through the window often made me put down my dishtowel.
Why didn't you speak up sooner?
I'll remember you, honey.
You're the one that got away.
Come on, boy, get!
Knucklehead, why d'you hit the brakes?
You got your life's work paying for this car.
Granddad's out here.
He's crawling in the road.
Granddad, what happened?
Are you hurt?
I wanted to take a look around the place.
I fell off my horse.
- He's hurt pretty bad.
- Let me up.
- Come on.
- A man ain't to crawl.
Take my car to the ranch. Call an ambulance. Tell them to get here quick.
Tell them we got an awful sick man here.
Let me up.
It won't start.
All right, forget it. Forget it.
There's a bottle of whiskey in the dash.
Bring it over.
Easy, easy, old man.
Don't make me drink that stuff.
Go to the main road, flag a car down.
Get some help up here. Move!
- Don't send him away, Hud.
- I'm right here, Granddad. Don't worry.
I feel kinda cold.
Everything's gonna be all right.
- I don't know if I want it to be.
- Don't say that. You'll be just fine.
I feel like throwing in the sponge.
Like givin' up.
You've never quit on anything in your whole life.
Hud there's waiting on me.
And he ain't a patient man.
He isn't gone, is he?
Yeah.
I meant to buy him a brand-new blanket-lined jacket.
And give it to him some time or other.
Lonnie. Hey.
It was the best thing.
He was wore out and he knew it.
He didn't seem so bad.
He didn't seem so bad off at all.
Well, he was. Trying to get up.
Hurting himself.
He couldn't have made it.
Anyway, he couldn't have made it another hour.
He could if he'd wanted to. You fixed it so he didn't want to any more.
You don't know the whole story.
Yeah, him and me fought many and many a round together.
But I guess you could say I helped him about as much as he ever helped me.
How did you help him, Hud?
By trying to sell him out?
By taking the heart out of him?
By making him give up and quit?
Is that how you helped him?
He ain't in any loaf-around eternal life.
He's the way he always was.
Enjoying his good horses.
Looking after the land.
Trying to figure out ways to beat the dry weather and wind.
Settle down. You've still got the graveyard in front of you.
I know what you're feeling, but look at it this way. He's gone to a better place.
I don't think so.
Not unless dirt is a better place than air.
Well, we took him to the graveyard and put him down.
It's all over with now.
- What have you got there?
- My gear.
Going someplace?
Yeah.
Travelling kinda light, ain't ya?
Got everything I need.
Planning to go for good?
That's right.
What about your half of the spread here?
Put my share in the bank. I'm going somewhere else to work for a while.
If I can happen on to a job.
Ain't you a little bit green to go cutting loose on your own?
Well, we'll see.
I was about your age when I went in the army.
Your granddaddy bought me a Mars candy bar at the station, and said,
"Character's the only thing
I got to give you. Be a man."
Well, I guess he was kinda worried.
Your trying so hard to get out of the draft.
Honcho!
I just wanted you to know that if you don't make your million, you can always come back and work for me.
I won't be back this way.
I guess you've come to be of your granddaddy's opinion that I ain't fit to live with.
That's too bad.
We might've whooped it up some.
That's the way you used to want it.
I used to. So long, Hud.
Fantan, this world is so full of crap, a man's gonna get into it sooner or later, whether he's careful or not.
THE SAMURAI
There is no greater solitude
than the samurai's,
unless perhaps it be
that of the tiger in the jungle.
The Book of Bushido
Saturday, 4th April. 6 p.m.
Jef?
This evening I came round at 7.15 and stayed till 2 a.m.
Can't be done. Wiener called.
He said he'd be back at two.
All right, until 1.45, then.
I like it when you come round because you need me.
It is your say.
How long will you be here?
We have the room all night.
Count me in from 2 o'clock.
Bring money, in case you lose.
I never lose.
Never completely.
- Who are you?
- It doesn't matter.
What do you want?
To kill you.
General alert!
Carry out the usual round-ups and identity checks all night.
The killer is believed to be tall, wearing hat and raincoat.
I want at least 20 likely suspects from each precinct.
So what if it makes 400?
The population's 10 million.
Hurry it up, or it'll be too late.
Police! Open up!
Identities check.
Your papers, gentlemen.
- How long have you been here?
- Since 7 o'clock.
What about you?
9 or 9.15.
- How do you earn your living?
- Full disability pension, war wounds.
When did you get here?
2 or 2.15.
Come along with us. Routine check.
If you can show legal means of support, you'll be released.
Quiet please!
Damolini, Ange S閞aphin, 41.
Picked up in a bar, corner of rue Saint-Dominique.
Carrying a gun.
Take off the glasses.
What have you to say?
Not a thing.
What were you doing with a gun in your pocket?
Next.
Over here!
Garcia, Juan, 47, and Delbarre, Jeanne, 51.
Picked up in the street.
The man armed.
Take off your hat.
You aren't married, are you?
Living together?
Why the gun?
The streets aren't safe at night in Paris.
I might have to defend myself.
Consider your record.
1945: Sentenced to 6 months for incitement of minors to vice.
1950: 12 months for drug trafficking.
1952: Attempted burglary.
1955: Sentenced for immoral earnings.
1958: Attempted murder.
1960: Manslaughter charge, insufficient evidence.
Well?
Next.
Costello, Jef, 30.
No criminal record, matches description given.
Not carrying a gun.
He wore a hat.
Put your hat on.
It wasn't a hat like that.
It was darker.
No, it was a light colour.
But he had a moustache, I think.
Why did you shave, Costello?
I've never worn a moustache.
I don't think it was him.
No, definitely not.
Sorry, but I think it is.
I remember exactly how the man looked.
Yes, indeed, it could be him.
Where were you from 12 to 2?
At my fiancé's.
Name, address and phone number.
Is that necessary?
Unless you want to be held.
Jane Lagrange,
11 avenue de I'Amiral Bruix.
Telephone?
Mac-Mahon 91-73.
Mademoiselle Lagrange, please.
Just Mademoiselle Lagrange.
Aside from the gentleman who escorted you here, any other visitor last night?
Your private life is not our concern.
Entertain whom you wish.
That is your right.
I simply want to know whether, before Monsieur Wiener arrived at two, you had another visitor?
Until when? And who?
Until 1.45. A man.
I imagined so.
The same age as Monsieur Wiener?
No, younger.
Somewhere around thirty?
Yes, around thirty.
The time?
From 7 or 7.15 until 1.45.
Sure it was 1.45?
I made him leave then.
I was expecting Monsieur Wiener at 2.
I understand.
Now, just for verification.
The name of this 30-year old?
Do I have to say?
Jef Costello.
Will you wait a moment, please?
He didn't mention that he knew the victim well?
- Why didn't you tell him?
- Because it's not true.
You'll have to prove that.
I believe you'll have to prove the contrary.
What you won't be able to deny, or not for long anyway, is your regular attendance at that establishment.
I've never set foot in the place.
What is it you want?
Costello's confession to a crime he didn't commit?
Optimistic, aren't you?
I'll make you change your tune in a moment.
Bring Wiener straight in here.
Monsieur Wiener, at 2 or 2.15, you visited Mademoiselle Lagrange?
That is correct.
Think carefully before you answer this.
Did you get the feeling, when you arrived, that someone had just left?
Forgive the frankness, but...
Did you feel that your place was still warm?
- I beg your pardon?
- Please answer.
I'm not very observant.
More's the pity.
I do remember something though.
When I entered the apartment block, someone had pressed the light button.
I noticed a man going past me, on his way out.
Now that I think of it, he wasn't far from her door and could well have just left.
Would you recognise the man?
I don't think so.
Let's try, shall we?
Hats and coats on, gentlemen.
Form up in 3 ranks.
You come with me.
Stand over there.
Change coats with him.
And you, your hat.
Please come with me.
Do you recognise the man you passed in the hallway of Mademoiselle Lagrange?
Do you recognise anyone?
I have a composite image of the man I passed.
That raincoat.
That hat.
Or that one.
That face.
What would the result have been if you were observant?
Will you come with me, please?
That's it.
I'm sorry. The nature of our work is sometimes inconsistent with courtesy.
May I go if you've finished with me?
Certainly.
So my private life
"is not our concern"?
I'm investigating a crime.
I can't be choosy about my methods.
Time's precious.
May I go too?
Of course.
Show Mademoiselle out.
I'm going to show you Costello once more.
Try to be categorical.
No maybes or perhapses.
Either: "Yes, it's him" or "No, it's not".
Show him in.
Do you recognise this man?
Did you see him leave the door to the offices?
Definitely not.
Thank you. Please wait in my office.
Do you still say that this was the man you saw?
I can answer that categorically.
I'm asking you to.
Yes, it was him.
Please wait in my office.
Do you recognise this man?
Frankly, I don't think so.
Same question.
I'm not sure. I'd need to see the other one again.
I don't know. I'm not sure.
I can't answer categorically.
Mademoiselle, only you got a good look at the man who killed Martey.
I can either hold him and try to break his alibi, as one witness has formally identified him.
Or he'll be set free, depending on your answer.
And that'll be the end of it.
I'm in no doubt whatsoever.
He was definitely not the man.
Thank you.
Not at all.
That's all, gentlemen.
Sunday, 5.45 a.m.
May I go?
Unfortunately.
- How many suspects left?
Same routine for them all.
A nice way to spend Sunday.
What do you think about Costello?
I never think.
1 rue Lord Byron.
1 rue Lord Byron. He's inside.
I'll drive round the block, then back here to see if he comes out.
Watch it. There's another entrance on the Champs Elys閑s: 116B.
I'm coming to it.
Stay there and report.
I can park.
He's taking the metro.
Follow him. Or try anyway.
He got away. What do I do?
The usual. Come back here.
It's done.
I know. You were arrested, though?
No problem.
Fine. A deal's a deal.
We can't leave him on the lose like that.
Homicide picked him up and had him in custody.
That he's been freed proves nothing.
He may still be a suspect.
I don't think so.
He set himself up a terrific alibi.
Suppose they break it?
No way. It comes in two parts, each one entirely separate.
I can imagine. He's really good, that's why we used him.
He fulfilled the contract:
To kill Martey without leaving any trail.
He's a Ione wolf.
He's a wounded wolf, now there will be a trail.
He must be disposed of quickly.
The police won't find a culprit, so they'll stay on his trail.
Despite that alibi of his, he's still their number one suspect.
We'll be on his trail, too.
Don't let him slip through your fingers again.
No proof, yet something stinks.
What?
I don't know.
He's different.
The other suspects I can hold for 48 hours, but not him.
- His alibi holds up.
- Too well.
Wiener's telling the truth.
But I'm sure the girl's lying.
We have to find a way to break her, so she'll talk.
If we can get her on a perjury charge or whatever, we'll have our Jef Costello, sitting right here.
If you're right, he'll just laugh.
I don't think so.
Have you seen many guys with nothing to say after two days in handcuffs?
I haven't.
Keep after the girl but don't lose him.
Sunday, 10 p.m.
One could say, if you were the guy the police want, the killer always returns to the scene of the crime.
May I get in?
Why say you didn't recognise me?
Why kill Martey?
I was to be paid.
What had he done to you?
Not a thing.
I didn't know him.
I met him for the first and last time
24 hours ago.
What sort of man are you?
You knew Martey and unfortunately, you have no alibi.
I was driving in from Fontainebleau.
With no witnesses to prove it.
- Anything?
- No, the stoolies seem to be on strike.
God forbid!
- Here's something.
- What?
Costello dumped it, leaving his place.
What's in it?
Bloody gauze and cotton wool.
He's hurt.
- Interesting. You know where he is?
- Of course.
I haven't much time to find out who wanted Martey dead.
What do you care?
I got paid off with a bullet.
I don't want them to try again, so I have to find them first.
The blond guy I met on the footbridge didn't give me much time to think.
I need to find him and his boss.
They hired you, didn't they?
Through an intermediary.
The reason you didn't identify me could be... that you like playing games with the police, or that you weren't supposed to recognise me.
Under arrest,
I became an indirect threat to whoever ordered the killing.
So?
Perhaps you know where he is.
6.10... Call me in 2 hours.
Monday, 7 a.m.
Dreadful, aren't they?
It's hard to stop them from overdoing things.
Promotion is very important to a policeman.
I was the same when I was younger.
- Whereas now you're more fatalistic?
- Exactly.
You like things to run smoothly.
I don't like forcing the pace to extract confessions or get information.
I'm very liberal, a great believer in the liberty of the individual, in people's right to live as they choose.
Provided that the way of life they choose harms no one else and is contrary to neither law nor public decency.
- Don't you agree?
- What are you telling me?
This: On the night Martey was killed, according to your sworn testimony,
Jef Costello was with you at your place from 7 p.m. To 1.45 a.m.
- Is that correct?
- Yes it is.
Suppose that I discover that Costello wasn't with you during those 6 hours.
You'll be laying yourself open to charges of perjury, contempt of court, obstruction of justice and accessory to murder.
That will mean five years, minimum.
Five years is a long time, especially for a girl of your age.
I'm telling you this because I have a daughter just your age, and I would find it distressing.
Really?
You're wrong not to believe me.
You seem to be a fine young woman.
Very much so, in fact.
Your attitude has shown one thing at least:
You have courage.
I don't know many who'd do as much for a boyfriend, sorry...
For a fiancé?
Your behaviour has been immaculate, but I can't say the same for his.
- Have you seen him since?
- No.
I thought not...
The rotten little jerk.
Do you know where he is right now?
Would you like to know?
I'll tell you anyway.
He's with that nightclub pianist.
They've suddenly become inseparable.
A very passionate thing, it seems.
You don't seem to mind.
Don't you love him?
Really?
I'd have said you did.
Laying yourself on the line for him like that,
I thought you must love him.
You're not the psychologist you imagined.
I suppose not.
I saw him as your...
How do they put it?
Your fancy man.
And the respectable gentleman,
Wiener, as the one who pays the bills.
Girls like you are close to being prostitutes.
Have you ever thought about it?
You should.
Your life could be made very unpleasant, if the Vice Squad chose to.
They don't play games.
You need to be covered...
No pun intended.
You'd cover for me?
Better than that.
I'd like to help you out of this spot.
This is your statement.
Tell me, without witnesses, that Costello wasn't here that night, and I'll tear it up.
No more problems about perjury.
And you won't have to make another statement.
What about the Vice Squad?
You have my word. They'll keep away.
I knew you were a bright girl.
If I understand you right, if I perjure myself,
I'll have no problems.
If I insist on telling the truth, then I can expect trouble.
Am I right?
Not quite.
Because the truth isn't what you say.
It's what I say, despite the methods I am obliged to employ to get at it.
So?
Is it yes?
It's no.
As you wish.
But we'll meet again.
Put it back.
Come on!
We made two mistakes.
The first was thinking your release was a police trap.
The second was thinking this made you a threat.
That's why I tried to kill you.
Now we feel we should begin again.
Here's the balance of the money you're owed for Martey's killing.
You guaranteed there'd be no problems.
Imagine how we felt when you were arrested.
We have the same again for you.
Two million old francs.
Payable in advance this time.
It's the same kind of job, another contract.
Nothing to say?
Not with a gun on me.
Is that a principle?
It's a habit.
Get up.
Here's my answer: Who sent you?
I can't tell you that.
Yet you could try to kill me.
Look at me.
I'll ask you just once more.
Who? Name and address.
You don't know him.
He's not in our league.
Don't keep me waiting.
Olivier Rey.
The address.
73 boulevard de Montmorency.
That's how you became unemployed.
Tell me about the new contract.
He found the bug, so he'll be more on his guards than ever.
Stick to him like glue as soon as he leaves home.
Everything's ready. He knows the metro like the back of his hand.
We'll shadow him step by step.
And no slip-ups this time.
You're in charge of the cars.
You'll be in the metro, with 50 men and 20 auxiliaries.
Each man carries a transmitter.
When in contact with Costello, he switches it this way.
Losing contact, he switches it that way.
The next contact does the same.
I'll be here, keeping the cars in touch with what's happening below.
Move.
- Car 11 checking in.
- Car 13 checking in.
- Car 38 checking in.
- Car 41 checking in.
That's it, contact established.
Contact broken, he got off at Jourdain.
Re-establish contact at all costs.
A car to Place des F阾es station, to Botzaris, to Pré Saint-Gervais.
Message received.
Car 167 to Botzaris station.
Car 16 to Place des F阾es.
Car 39 to Pré Saint-Gervais. Over.
Wrong platform.
What's happened?
- What?
- We lost him.
He shook off an auxiliary.
I'm covering all exits.
I don't think he's left yet.
- Enough auxiliaries?
- I'm expecting more.
Some cars aren't here yet.
Let's hope he picks an exit that's already covered.
- The platforms?
- They're OK.
I warn you, Jef, this is the last time.
All right.
- You heard me?
- I think so. I had a feeling...
Maybe I was just hoping you would come.
Trouble?
Because of me?
You've never meant trouble for me.
They gave you a hard time?
What about you?
Do you need me?
Yes, you do.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do, Jef?
Nothing.
Don't worry. I'll handle this.
What do you want?
You got your money?
You accept the new contract?
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm just leaving.
Don't stay here.
Why, Jef?
I've been paid to...
That was a narrow squeak.
But for us, you'd be dead.
No, you wouldn't.
Time we took off, too.
What do you think, Whisky?
You little sugar-eater.
There, that's a good girl.
That's a good girl.
You're beginning to learn.
Try not to make a fool of yourself the way you did yesterday?
Oh, you're cute. You're real cute, you are.
Yes, you are.
You stop that now. Come on.
Don't you...
Now, you stop that.
That's a baby.
That's right. You're doing just fine.
That's a real nice girl.
That's a real nice, sweet girl.
Come on over here. Come over here.
All right, you're starting it again?
Okay, baby.
Well, let's get it out of your system.
Come on.
Turn right!
What do you think you're doing?
You did fine, little girl.
You gotta remember, when I say, "Hup," you better hup.
You'll learn, pretty little fuzztail.
What I'm trying to teach you is a little horse sense. Now, hup.
That's it. Now, come on.
Hi.
Welcome home.
Been a long time.
Still painting.
I was expecting you, Jack.
Isn't that odd?
I heard a horse, and I knew it was your horse.
It's a new horse.
Three-year-old mare.
Part range stock, part appaloosa, still a little bit spooky.
Well, must get it from you.
Well, don't just stand there. You give me a kiss.
I must say, you haven't changed a bit.
You, either. Thanks.
Well, come on. Let me get you something to eat.
There's coffee there on the stove. Good.
I'll take about six fried eggs.
If you got some ham to put under them, so much the better.
Coming up. Hup.
What've you been doing with yourself?
I was afraid you were gonna ask that.
Oh, not herding sheep again?
Herding sheep again.
You know, you keep that up, you're gonna end up on a dude ranch.
Probably.
I'm glad you came, Jack.
God, I'm glad you came.
Picked up a paper, said Paul was heading for two years in the penitentiary.
Started riding the same day.
There's nothing you can do to help Paul.
Well, I'm not so sure of that.
I'll mosey down and have a talk with him.
We'll work something out.
We always did.
No, they won't even let you see him until visiting day.
That's Wednesday.
By then they might have moved him to the penitentiary.
You can almost always arrange to see a fella.
He finish his book?
Half of it.
The other half'll have to wait two years.
Hey.
How about Seth?
Seth's in school.
Already in school. Why, that poor little devil.
How come Paul got mixed up smuggling those wetbacks across the border?
He didn't smuggle anybody.
He just helped them after they got here.
He hid them and fed them and gave them directions about where to find work, that's all.
Well, what's wrong with that?
Oh, nothing. Nothing. It's just a crime, that's all.
The immigration people warned Paul twice, but he just kept right on.
Good for him.
Oh, sure, good for him, and hoorah for two years in the penitentiary.
I get so mad I could kill him.
The reason you get mad at Paul is you don't understand him.
Understand him? Just how long is that supposed to take?
I've only been married seven years, you know, Jack.
Yeah, but, basically you're still an Easterner.
What are you talking about, Jack?
Told you, you didn't understand.
A Westerner likes open country.
That means he's got to hate fences.
And the more fences there are, the more he hates them.
I never heard such nonsense in my life.
It's true, though.
You ever notice how many fences there are getting to be?
The signs that they got on them.
No hunting, no hiking, no admission, no trespass, private property, closed area, start moving, go away, get lost, drop dead.
Know what I mean? I don't even want to know.
Then they got those fences that say, "This side's jail."
Or that side's the street. Or here's Arizona, that's Nevada.
Or this is us, that's Mexico.
Hey, you're so hot, my ham's burning up.
Plate's there on the table.
Now, that one between here and Mexico is the fence got Paul into trouble.
He just naturally didn't see the use of it, so he acted as if it wasn't there.
So when people sneaked across it, he just felt they were still people, so he helped them.
Jack, I'm gonna tell you something.
The world that you and
Paul live in doesn't exist.
Maybe it never did.
Out there is a real world.
And it's got real borders and real fences.
Real laws and real trouble.
And either you go by the rules or you lose.
You lose everything.
You can always keep something.
I don't know.
I don't understand men anymore.
Paul had a choice and he chose jail instead of his family.
Why, Jack?
Doesn't he need us as much as we need him?
You forgot the salt and pepper.
Now, you talk about that jail sentence as if it was another woman he was going out with.
Isn't it?
Maybe it is.
Maybe he had to have one more fling with her before the old man with the white hair moves in.
Fling with who?
Girl Paul and I grew up with.
Kind of a wild-eyed little mountain girl.
Her name is Do-What-You-Want-To-Do-And-
The-Hell-With-Everybody-Else.
Probably an Indian girl, they all got names like that.
Men are idiots.
You're an idiot, Paul's an idiot, you're all idiots.
These eggs are gonna be rock-hard,
Jack. Come on and sit down.
You make me nervous.
Is there anything else you want?
A bath.
I'm beginning to smell like a wild animal that hasn't even been rained on for about five years.
Hey, you're not going to
Coffeyville, Kansas, are you?
No, I'm hauling privies to Duke City, New Mexico.
You're hauling what? Privies.
Hundred and fifty-six privies.
High-tailing down the road at 70 miles an hour. How do you like that?
What kind of emergency do you suppose they got in Duke City, New Mexico?
I feel about four pounds lighter.
It's always hard to get
'em on over clean socks.
Well, you got awful big feet, Jack.
No, that's not it.
Your feet swell after a bath.
I'm not sure whether it's good for 'em or not.
There!
Gotta give that little mare a drink before I go.
Money in that bandoleer.
Want you to use it if anything goes wrong.
What can go wrong?
Hard to tell. Probably nothing.
What are you gonna do, Jack?
Already told you.
I'm gonna give that little mare a drink.
Give her some grass in the morning if I'm not back.
Do that?
Do that.
Tell Seth I'll see him later?
Jack, what are you gonna do?
Well, about every six months I figure I owe myself a good drunk.
Rinses your insides out, sweetens your breath, tones up your skin.
Well, then, buy a bottle and drink it here.
Getting caught drunk in public's about the easiest way
I know of breaking into jail.
It's more fun, too.
Be careful, Jack.
Don't make any trouble.
Trouble's what I came here to fix up.
You be a good girl, Whisky.
I'll be back pretty soon.
Okay, I'll be careful.
And keep the change.
Hey, watch it there, fella, I almost spilled...
My fault, amigo.
I'm sorry.
Now, why'd you throw that bottle?
I never saw you before in my life.
Try and watch it?
You sure you got the right fella?
We haven't even been introduced.
My name's Burns.
What's the matter, cowboy?
I only got one arm.
You ain't afraid to fight a one-armed man, are you?
You know, a fella can get hurt falling backwards off a chair?
Are you positive it's me you want, amigo?
I'm not afraid of you, cowboy.
I don't give a damn how many arms you grow.
If you're not satisfied with the arm you've got, why don't you chop it off?
I lost that arm in Okinawa.
What did you do?
Oh, I didn't do anything.
Let's have a drink and talk it over.
You're afraid, you cobarde.
Never call a man that, no matter what. Never do it.
I might kill you for calling me a thing like that.
Just stand where you are, boys.
This fella wants action,
I'll be glad to accommodate him.
Do it one arm behind my back.
If any of you boys interfere, I use two hands.
All right, maldito.
Use your left arm, amigo.
Give me the police.
Listen to me, you...
Not two hands!
One arm, amigo.
You fight with your left hand, just like him. See, mister?
He had to use both hands.
That's him. The cowboy on the bottom!
Okay, the fight's over. Break it up.
Hey, I'm down here. Hurry up, will you?
Geez! Come on.
All right, cowboy, let's go.
I thought you guys never would get here.
Okay, cowboy.
Come back again, amigo!
Okay, Joe, can him.
Cell blocks are full. Have to throw him in the tank.
This way, Pop. Just because I got no money, that's a crime?
Called vagrancy.
All it does is fill your belly and keep you off the streets for a night or two. Yeah, yeah.
King of England don't carry no money, either.
Would you arrest him if he showed up in this stinking gut-trap cesspool of a pest house passing for a town, would you?
Can it talk?
I can talk all right.
Identification?
He hasn't got any.
Tobacco, matches, $6 in bills,
38 cents in change, pocket knife, and a dried-up ear.
An ear?
Yeah, looks like a bull's ear.
You mean to say you got no identification at all?
That's right.
No draft card, no social security?
No discharge, no insurance, no driver's license?
No nothing?
No nothing.
Look, cowboy, you can't go around without identification.
It's against the law. How are people gonna know who you are?
I don't need a card to figure out who I am. I already know.
Okay, who are you?
John W. Burns.
Jack for short.
You sure of that?
Sure enough to bet you can't prove I'm anybody else.
Where do you live?
Anywhere I feel like.
Now, what the devil does that mean?
Well, it means I don't have any address.
You've got to. Where do your folks live?
Missouri.
Occupation?
Sure.
Well, what is it?
Cowhand.
You a veteran?
Wasn't everybody who could stand up straight for five minutes without falling over backwards?
Yeah, just about.
What's the charge? Drunk?
And disorderly.
Meira's Bar on North Highland Road.
Fight?
Him and Lopato. Good one.
That one-armed guy?
Cowboy here was using one arm, too.
You shouldn't have tangled with that fella, cowboy.
He's mean. He could have stuck you.
That all you got against him?
That's it.
Look, we're loaded today.
Even the tanks are full.
This fellow's sobering up pretty quick.
What do you say we turn him loose?
Okay by me. Let him go, Phil.
- Okay.
- We just answered a call.
You mean you're going to turn me loose?
When I'm in a condition like this?
That's right, cowboy.
Look, you just go wherever you're staying and sleep it off.
Okay, but first I'm going back there and I'm gonna kill that one-armed leftover from a pig litter!
Get your arms off me, flat foot!
What's he doing?
Hey!
Tobacco, one pocketknife, one dry ear.
You son of a gun...
Get your foot out of my...
You guys are supposed to be...
He wants it the hard way.
One dry, pointed ear.
Here's a receipt for what you brought in. Can him.
Tank?
Yeah. Run him through the showers first.
You know something, buddy.
From a ten-day common drunk, you've built yourself up to a year.
Congratulations.
Good afternoon, Miss Kennedy.
Good afternoon, Mr. Johnson.
Mrs. Johnson called.
She wants you to remember that shopping list she gave you.
All right.
Busy, Floyd?
Sure gave me a start, there, Sheriff.
Put that comic away.
Remember that girl on Lead Hill they found belly-down in the road with a knife in her back, and the coroner called it suicide?
Sure. Day before yesterday.
I want you to drive out and serve a writ on that coroner, then turn around and come straight back.
Don't I get to stop off for a bite first?
No, and button your pants.
Hi, Morey.
Harry.
That dog.
Same fire plug, same time every day.
You'd think he was under contract.
Red light's going, Harry. Have you got any time for the machine?
Machine? Right.
This is CS-1, over.
Roger, Highway Patrol. CS-1 out.
Yep.
Got Caruso's new barber pole third day in a row.
It's on the route now.
Don't know how he does it.
What was that signal, Harry?
Signal? State Highway
Patrol. Just a routine check.
Locate McNeill, wherever he is, send him out for chewing gum.
McNeill? Right.
When I tell you to watch that machine of yours, you say, "Machine? Right."
When I give you a message for
McNeill, you say, "McNeill? Right."
There's something about the way you make a question of it and then say, "Right," that gets on my nerves.
Nerves?
Right.
Head count.
Open it up, Bob.
Got another customer.
Right in here.
Okay, boys, relax.
When is suppertime around here, anyway?
Brother, if I was in your condition,
I would pay less attention to the flesh and more to the salvation of my eternal soul.
And believe me, I know whereof I'm talking about, you poor abandoned Philistine, you.
The temptations of the flesh.
I fought 'em my whole life through.
Then how come you're in here, Reverend?
I said I fought 'em. I didn't say I fought 'em off.
Sometimes I lost.
But believe me, it takes a lot more to tempt a preacher than it does you stumblebums in here.
When I lost, I lost big!
You a real preacher, Reverend?
Well, now, let's look at it this way.
Always had the urge to preach.
And if you got the urge, you're already halfway home.
What kept you from getting all the way?
My temptation was women.
You ain't a preacher any more than I'm a sway-backed goose.
And I don't think you've got sense enough to pound sand in a rabbit hole.
You are not in a state of grace.
Hi, Paul.
Jack.
You old son of a gun.
Glad to see you, fella.
So am I.
What happened to your face?
Oh, a bunch of guys I ran into down in some saloon gave it a new look.
Guess they didn't like the old one.
Come on, let's sit over here.
All right, let's have it.
You didn't get into a fight, you picked one, didn't you?
Me, pick a fight?
You're a great guy, Jack.
Oh, sure.
The only man on Earth who'd break in to jail just to see an old friend off to the penitentiary.
Breaking into a jail's the easiest thing a fella can do.
I guess you found that out for yourself.
Yeah.
See Jerry?
She's a little burned up right now, but these things aren't hard to straighten out.
What's outside that wall?
Bernal Boulevard.
Yeah, it would be.
Overlooks an alley in the back of a department store.
You see Seth?
No, he was in school.
Darn, I wanted to see that little fella.
Come on, let's join the parade.
Okay.
Floor's harder than I thought.
Don't step on this Indian here.
I'm not sure, but I think he carries a knife.
Smart Indian.
When do they begin shoving supper through that slot?
Shouldn't be long now.
I'm so hungry, every time I take a deep breath my stomach squeaks like a wet balloon.
Okay, Cliff.
Hey, amigo. Look at those mountains?
Chow down!
Come on, let's get the squeaks out of your stomach.
Chow. Chow!
Good afternoon, college boy.
Hey, you.
Too good to talk to me?
You too smart to have anything to do with me?
What do you want?
Come here, college boy.
Come here!
Take it easy. Temper like that, and one of these days you'll find yourself riding through town with your belly to the sun, your best suit on, and no place to go but hell.
Believe me, buddy, you better watch it.
Come on, let's sit over there.
Hey, cowboy, what's your name?
John W. Burns. Let's eat.
Jack, for short.
Okay, Burns.
Okay, John W. Burns.
Open up.
There's not much music in these bars.
I'm afraid the sons of guns are solid.
Are you sure you didn't get kicked in the head?
What do you mean?
You act like a man who thinks he's going to break out of jail.
Come here, college boy.
You crazy fool.
Nothing crazy about hacksaws in a jailhouse.
Do you know the penalty in this state for jail breaking?
Never broke one in this state.
Five years.
It'll take 'em an awful long time to catch us, amigo.
Don't worry about that.
You know, a fella just might be able to crawl through by cutting only one bar just about here.
Go through on your side. One shoulder at a time. Slow and easy, like.
Hey, when do these lights go out?
Around 9:00.
Guards?
They're gone.
Well, then let's get to work.
Jack, I've got two years as it is.
I'm not gonna break jail and risk five more.
I mean that.
Sure, amigo, but give yourself a fair shake.
Wait till we get one of those bars cut, then decide.
Long time between now and sun-up.
You might change your mind.
Not a chance.
But I'm sure gonna change yours.
You were in a bar fight.
You'll get 30 days at the most.
You wanna risk five years in the penitentiary for that?
Not 30 days, amigo. I'd get a year.
A year? I hit a deputy.
They charged me with criminal assault.
Criminal assault? How did you...
I had to. They wouldn't let me in.
I'm telling you, I won't serve a year in this place.
I couldn't.
My guts get all tied up just by thinking about it.
I'd go nuts. I'd kill somebody.
You know, amigo, I'd kill somebody. Sure.
Yes. I guess maybe you would.
Look, amigo.
I've got two hacksaws.
It'll take two men.
You don't want to get involved.
Which one of these involvements is mine?
Come on. We'll work the same bar.
The same place. She'll cut fast.
Hombre, what do you fellas do?
Working our way through college.
Makes trouble for everybody.
Not if you don't see it.
Hey, you boys sharpening your toenails?
Brushing our teeth.
You sure got bony teeth.
Hey.
If I hear somebody coming,
I'll give you the word.
Thanks, amigo.
She's all cut through, boss.
Good.
Let's see how this son of a gun bends.
Hand me that blanket rope.
You can't get through that.
You'd be surprised how flexible a man can be when he has to.
Let's hide all the gear. Come on!
John W. Burns!
Yeah?
I want you!
Jack, what are you...
Nose of mine cracks easy.
Man gives me fair notice, no reason I shouldn't prop up a little.
Telephone call.
In the office.
Who'd be calling me this time of night?
It's a surprise.
Come on.
I'm all right.
What a phone call.
What did he use on you?
Just his fists.
Lucky I had these.
Hate to lose those big ones.
Navajos took off?
Well, time to get moving.
Daylight pretty soon.
Well?
Listen, amigo.
I know a place in Sinaloa just aching to hide us.
Good cabin, lots of rain.
You'd write your book, I'd run a cow or two, Jerry could paint.
And Seth, he'd learn.
Like we used to talk about. Natural man.
You got a bad case of something.
I don't know what it is, but it sure loused up your good sense.
You think they should've given you two years for what you did?
No. Then why let 'em win?
Nobody's winning.
I knew what it was going to cost and I went right ahead and did it.
Now I have a debt to pay off.
You can pay off a third, amigo.
Jerry and Seth, they pay the rest.
I know.
In a half hour, Jerry'll be frying eggs for both of us.
I'm not going to break jail.
You shouldn't have come here in the first place.
I'm staying here.
Can't you understand that?
How many times do I have to tell you?
Okay.
Okay, amigo.
Jack.
You've gotta go. I know that.
But it's different with me.
I can take jail because I've got two people out there waiting for me.
I've got something to go back to.
Don't you see? I...
I don't want Seth to grow up and be the way we were.
I don't want Jerry and Seth to have to run from anything, ever.
If I broke out tonight, they'd be running alongside me for the rest of their lives.
Do you understand, Jack?
Sure, I understand.
You grew up on me, didn't you?
No, Jack. I just changed.
Yeah, that's what I mean. You changed.
God.
God, Jack, I hope you make it.
I'll make it, all right.
You take a loner, he travels awful fast.
Who is it? Who's there?
Me.
I was hoping you'd wake up.
You were in jail, weren't you?
In and out.
Was Paul all right? Sure.
Has anything happened? Paul's just fine.
He sends you his love.
You broke out of jail, didn't you?
What else could I do?
Are the police after you?
Well, I hope not yet, but they will be before that sun is very far up.
Well, if you're on the run, you'll need some food.
You sure feed me good.
What did they do to you?
I got rousted a little.
Well, it's just lucky I washed that shirt of yours.
You can't go anywhere that way.
Well, thanks.
You men just make me sick.
You just act like children, all of you.
Why, even Seth or that crazy horse of yours out there would have better sense than you do.
Here you are, all cut up and running away from the police.
And there's Paul sitting there in jail, and all you do is grin about it.
Believe you me, if it didn't take men to make babies,
I wouldn't have anything to do with any of you.
Well, at least you'll have some food.
Oh, thanks.
You know, those paintings of yours,
I never did understand the darned things.
But whatever point they're making, they sure make it big.
They're lousy.
I could use that ammunition
I left in that bandoleer.
I'll get it for you.
Thanks.
Here, I'll take part and you take part.
Oh, no, Jack...
That little mare, if she wants action, she's sure gonna get it, next two or three days.
I don't know.
Maybe you'd be better off if they caught you.
Maybe, but I'd like to put it off for as long as possible.
Jack.
Will I ever see you again?
Sure will. These things blow over.
You'll see me some evening when things are peaceful again.
Jack.
Jerry.
Jack! Jack!
I always missed you, Jerry.
I always will.
You wanted too much.
I didn't want enough.
I didn't want a house, didn't want all those pots and pans.
I didn't want anything but you.
And it's God's own blessing I didn't get you.
Why?
'Cause I'm a loner clear down deep to my very guts.
You know what a loner is? He's a born cripple.
He's crippled because the only person he can live with is himself.
It's his life, the way he wants to live it. It's all for him.
A guy like that, he'd kill a woman like you because he couldn't love you, not the way you are loved.
You'll change someday, too, Jack.
I could have, maybe.
I can't now. Too late.
Paul did, though.
You know I tried to get him to break jail?
I knew you'd try.
I was afraid he'd do it, too.
He turned me down cold.
And it's not because he wants to spend two years with that wild-eyed little mountain girl you were jealous of.
You know, Do-What-You-
Want-To-Do-And-The-Hell-With-Everybody-Else?
Forget her. You've got her backed off the map.
I don't know what you've done to him, you and Seth, but he's a good three times bigger than he ever was before.
That sun's still coming up.
If I had a big kiss, I could probably beat it to the top of that hill.
Thanks.
God keep.
Roger, CS-2, I got that fine.
This is CS-1, over and out.
Hey, Morey?
I got the report on that cowboy.
Yeah?
John W. Burns, Socorro, New Mexico.
He's born 1919, Joplin, Missouri.
He served seven months in a US
Army disciplinary training center at Inchon, South Korea, for striking a superior officer.
February 22nd, 1951.
February 22nd.
He was just celebrating
Washington's birthday, that's all.
Wounded in action, November 4th, 1951.
Election day.
Purple Heart, Distinguished
Service Cross with oak leaves.
Discharged at Fort Dix, New
Jersey, February 14th, 1952.
Valentine's Day.
Broke out of disciplinary training center, June 14th, 1951.
Flag Day.
Anything on the two Navajos?
A couple of previous plain drunks.
Bill Hassler from the news wants to see you.
That fathead. What does he want?
I didn't tell him you were in, but the story on the jailbreak.
Then tell him I'm out.
There goes that dog again.
Atta boy!
Faithful Fido.
Now, cut across and hit that barber pole.
CS-1, over. Go on.
Roger. I got Floyd.
Switch on the speaker.
Speaker? Right.
This is CS-4.
When do I get off for lunch? Where's Johnson? Over.
I'll take that.
Floyd, the boys upstairs tell me that the cowboy and Bondi were chummy.
Get over to Bondi's house and see what you can find out. Over.
You want me to check or have lunch first? Over.
Cut out the horsing around, get over there now. Out!
I bet you're way above the foothills already, cowboy.
I'll just bet you are.
You little witch, when I say "whoa", you better whoa.
You gotta have everything first, don't you?
No danger of you bloating up.
Get about one good swallow every five minutes.
Green grass, too.
You never had it so good.
Don't worry, Whisky, I'm not going anywhere just yet.
Damn.
This is CS-1. Come on in, Floyd. Over.
I saw boot prints, Morey.
When you see boot prints, you've got a right to assume those high heels fit into a stirrup.
And I was right. I found a trail, Morey.
Then farther up, I come on a place where somebody had cut a hole in that barbed wire fence at the edge of the mesa.
It was a new cut, no rust on the end of the wires.
Trail goes straight east to the mountains, Morey. Over.
Floyd, that's good work. Come on in and get something to eat.
Over and out.
Call the forest ranger at El Sangre and tell him to check on any campfires.
Get the relay station up on the rim, tell 'em the same thing.
Right.
Don't blow it all away. Feed's gonna be scarce for a while.
Gonna have visitors, little gal.
See that rim up there?
It's a good long climb.
Once we get to the other side of it, we're home, baby.
Judas priest!
Judas, Morey!
Well, don't stand there hollering
Judas! Keep on trying to get Glynn.
Okay.
CS-3 calling CS-4. Over.
Hello, CS-4, this is CS-3. Over.
They still don't get us, Morey.
Now, they'll be able to hear us when they hit the rim.
Call them other fellas and see if...
What? What'd you say, Morey?
I said call them other fellas and see if they're still on the road.
Tell 'em not to take the car up the wash. They'll never make it.
Have 'em go south another mile.
And ask the State if we're ever gonna get that airplane.
Airplane? Right!
Burns!
Come on back!
You can't get away!
Come back!
Stop that, Whisky. Stop that.
Come on.
Hi there, CS-4.
This is CS-3. Over.
Hey, I been trying to get you for a while. I read you fine now. Over.
Yeah. Hold it. Here comes Morey.
Wait, I'll switch 'em on the speaker.
The general's been calling you, too, Morey.
That you, Glynn?
Yeah. We're awful high up.
We're up here on the southeast rim.
I never saw such country, Morey.
I'm staying near the car where
I can see the whole works.
Where's Gutierrez?
He's moving ahead along the rim trail to see what he can find close up.
Okay, and out.
Now, what's this about a general?
From the air base. General
Desalius. He wants to talk to you.
Well, get him!
CS-3 calling...
Why don't you two do a little scouting over in Bear Canyon?
Don't get lost.
Sheriff Johnson here to talk to General Desalius. Over.
Hello. This is General Desalius.
Yes, sir. Just a moment, sir.
It's General Desalius.
This is Johnson. What can I do for you, General?
We're pretty busy out here right now. Over.
General Desalius here.
I understand you're hunting an escaped convict.
We're only 12 minutes away.
Can you use a helicopter and a brace of Air Police?
I'd like to give my personnel a little practical experience. Over.
Thank you, General. We don't need the Air Police, but we sure could use a helicopter.
We're moving to the bottom of the west wall at the mouth of Agua Dulce Canyon.
Whoa there.
Now you stay here and behave.
I'm gonna take a look around.
Sorry, have to keep moving, baby.
There it is! There it is!
Now, this is CS-3 ground to helicopter.
Can you hear me? Over.
What's the matter? Can't you get 'em?
Well, yeah, but he's so close we can't hardly hear him.
Give me that mike!
Ground to helicopter!
This is Sheriff Johnson!
Can you hear me? Over.
Yeah, he can hear you. See? He's waving.
All right.
Cruise up and down Bear Canyon.
That's the big canyon to the south.
And keep an eye out for a lone man on foot or leading a horse or riding.
Report anything you see. Over.
Observer to Sheriff Johnson.
Do you want us to drop down and pick him up? Over.
You can try if you want to.
If you can't land, just stay with him until we can get there. Okay? Over.
We can pick him out of a treetop if we want to.
You'd think we were chasing a ghost.
Invisible horse, invisible cowboy.
Harry, throw me that canteen.
I haven't got enough spit left to wet a stick of gum.
Roger, CS-1. This is CS-3. Over.
CS-3 out.
That was the State Police, Morey.
They got two patrol cars in Scissors Canyon.
They're moving four men into
Bear Canyon, and two to the rim.
And they're sending that airplane just as fast as they can.
Let's get out of this stinking arroyo.
I got a feeling we're being left behind.
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, baby.
Whoa, baby.
Whisky! Whisky!
Come here, girl. Come on.
Steady, Whisky.
Come here, girl. Come on, Whisky.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Whoa, baby.
Whisky!
Whoa, baby. Whoa.
Whisky! Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold still!
Damn you, hold still!
Take it easy, Whisky. For
God's sakes, take it easy!
Come on.
Looks like they couldn't make it, Morey.
They must be walking the rest of the way.
Hey, something's coming in, Morey!
Plug in the speaker!
We got him! We got him! He's right below us.
Man with a gray hat leading a horse.
Never mind that. Give me the binoculars.
He's trying to hide in the rocks.
He can't make it. We got him, all right.
Can't land here. No room for the prop.
We'll lower a rope ladder.
I'll climb down and get him.
Looks like they're getting some practical experience.
Hey! Somebody's shooting!
Get out of his line of fire.
He's not mad but he's awful smart.
He's trying to hit the tail rotor. Let us down easy.
He got the tail rotor, all right.
Get a fix on us,
Sheriff! We're going down!
Judas priest!
Get that, that General what's-his-name.
Tell him to send an ambulance.
Tell him his personnel just got a belly-full of practical experience.
Hurry!
Where are those binoculars?
CS-3, calling Air Base. Over.
CS-3 calling Air Base. Over.
See it crash, Morey?
No wind, no nothing!
It just sank like a rock in a well.
It didn't sink, you fool.
Our cowboy's just shot down the Air Force, that's all.
Get over there and help 'em. Both of you.
- Hurry up!
- This is CS-3.
I just wanted to report to you that...
What a mess!
The helicopter you sent us has been shot down by the fugitive, and has crashed just below us. Over.
Yes, sir, General
Desalius, just a minute.
I'll get Sheriff Johnson. Over.
Now if I can only spot that cowpoke.
That general sure wants to talk to you, Morey.
Well, get him!
I've got him.
I'm gonna get him on the speaker. He's awful hot.
Sheriff, this is General Desalius!
What have you done with my helicopter?
I didn't do anything with it,
General. The fugitive shot it down.
Your men aren't badly hurt, but you'll have to haul that flying machine out of here piece by piece. Over.
Do you know how much my helicopters cost, Sheriff?
Do you? Do you have any notion at all?
No, I don't know,
General, and I don't...
You didn't let me finish.
I don't know what it cost and I don't give a damn! Over and out!
Turn that thing off!
I'm going over there and set for a while.
Call the State and have them put armor plate on that plane they ain't sent us and ain't going to.
Call Glynn and see how Gutierrez is doing on the rim trail.
Call Herrera and ask if he's sleeping or tracking.
Keep calling 'em all. Keep
'em talking. Keep 'em moving.
CS-3 calling CS-4.
For two bits I'd call the whole thing off.
Morey wants a fix on Gutierrez.
Get on 'im, will you? Over and out.
Son of a gun!
Heading straight for the rim, aren't you, cowboy?
You know, I believe if you'd turn loose of that horse, you'd make it.
Harry! Get me Glynn and
Gutierrez up on the hill.
Get 'em quick! Right.
Find a way outta here.
It's all over, John W. Burns.
I know where you are.
So step out beside your horse and put your hands up, John W...
Please.
My treat.
Now, hold still, you little whey-belly!
You been nothing but trouble since the first day I found you.
You're no good and you know it.
Besides, there's no way up there for both of us.
Unless you can climb a rope.
Just stay here and eat.
They'll pick you up when they find that gorilla over there.
Just take it easy.
You're worse than a woman.
What the hell!
All right, come on.
Come on.
Come on, come on.
All right, girl.
Oh, Whisky, girl.
You gotta listen, Whisky.
You stop playing.
Stop playing.
Hey, Bob! That's
Gutierrez down there!
There's something wrong with him!
Let's go!
Take it easy, Whisky.
The biggest stand of timber I ever did see.
All right, Whisky, girl!
Just another 50, 75 yards and we got pine trees rolling all the way to Mexico!
Hup! Let's go!
Come on!
Come on, Whisky. Make an effort!
Just one more effort! Come on!
There they are, boys! Up there!
Run, you little devil! Run, beauty! Run, sweetheart!
You son of a gun, you did it.
Yep, you sure did.
Crazy fool.
What's that?
Got any gum?
What'd you say, Morey?
You got any gum?
No, no, I don't buy gum. I don't use it.
Then stop hunting for it.
Whoa there, girl. Whoa.
Well, son of a gun.
Well...
Well, Whisky, girl. You're gonna be of some use after all.
Come here.
Okay, baby.
Think I'll cut across to Highway
60. Stop off at Banake's Diner.
You could use a good steak, couldn't you?
Steak? Right!
You pay attention, you sweet, brainless little cayuse.
Manzano Mountains on the other side of that road.
Lead us straight to Mexico on a carpet of pine needles.
Now, when I say "Hup..."
Whoa, whoa! Not yet, baby!
But when I say it, you just better do it.
Hup!
Come on, Whisky.
Oh, my God!
Hup! Hup!
God help me.
You're all right, buddy.
Blankets! Blankets! Somebody get me some blankets, quick!
I've got some in my car! Just a minute!
Take it easy, buddy. Take it easy.
Gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.
Just take it easy, buddy.
I'll go on ahead and call an ambulance.
You're gonna be all right, buddy. All right.
You're gonna be all right, buddy. You just take it easy.
Here. Here, gimme.
Just take it easy. Gonna be all right.
You just take it easy, buddy. I'll put this up.
Thank you. Take it easy.
Keep that traffic moving, John!
Want to put him in my car?
No, better not move him.
He's gotta take it awful easy.
What happened? Did you hit him?
Somebody's gone for an ambulance, Officer.
Why doesn't somebody put that poor animal out of its misery?
Check that horse.
Sure, Morey.
Excuse me.
Hello, Sheriff. Hi.
Is this the man you've been looking for?
I can't tell.
Man I'm looking for, I never saw him this close.
All right! Everybody stand back and let the ambulance in!
Move back! Cut it over!
All right, stand back.
Give him a chance.
He's gonna be all right.
Just take it easy. Sure you are, buddy.
I killed her, Morey.
Let's go home.
Let's get back to the cars, folks.
Now slide him in easy.
He ain't gonna die, is he?
How do I know?
We got a report to make out. Come on.
Drive it through!
All right, come on! Let's go!
Keep it moving! Come on! Faster!
Faster, faster! Come on!
Let's go!
Come on! Keep moving!
Faster! Faster!
They're coming.
They're coming Hank.
It's coming now.
You ought to take care of that
Edgar.
-Don't move, any of you.
-Move? I'm hit. Darn idiot fool.
You all right Adam?
Outside.
Go ahead.
All right. Get on out of here.
-What's the matter with that old crock Burn?
- There's something about that grove he don't like.
-Indians?
- Might be.
I don't know. Best take it cautious.
-We could go around.
-Why, everytime that old hag of yours gets skiddish?
Why don't you put a martingale on him?
We'll just go easy.
Chances are, if they was, they would have rode out on us.
Chances are, if they was, they would have rode out on us.
Yeah, something like that.
This ain't no country to be set afoot.
Man gets hung.
Are we far enough away from that human fruit to suit you?
Dick! Come on out.
-Three men coming this way.
-Three?
-Well, what are they Hank?
- Is that all you seen?
Ain't but three.
No, there ain't no one here going to do a little hard riding tonight.
I figure we'll wait on this, old boys.
Right Indian?
I ain't running from no free-range bums.
No, ain't no hands going to give us trouble.
I figure we'll let them bed down here, as long as they are wanting.
Joe, you and Hag might want to get up above there. Cover it just in case.
But if it looks clear, come on down.
-We ain't taking no chances, right Dick?
-Edgar, you sit right over there like you've been.
I might need some range.
When ever you think it's clear.
Ed?
This is Dick.
Howdy. Where you boys heading?
-Waco.
- Waco, Texas boys.
-Cowhands, are you?
-That's right.
Coming from up north?
Yeah, been two weeks since Pea
River.
Long right yet to Waco.
Well now. You boys might like to cut a little trail dust out of your necks, huh?
Why don't you step down and have a snort with me and old Edgar.
Well, that puts no pale on you little boy.
Much obliged.
-I'm Dick and this here is Edgar.
-Vern.
-Wes.
-Otis.
They call me blind Dick, on account of one eye.
There's a whole coral down there on the side.
You go on with them.
- What outfit's the trail with?
- Crossfield, Seabard.
Heading back there huh?
- No.
Where? Waco.
Just the three of you?
Yeah, three's all. Five of you?
-Run into any coyotes up around the Pea?
- Two or three. Signs mostly.
Was just telling Otice and Vern here how Adam fell on his knife and that's what wrong with him.
-Have a snort
- Obliged.
-You boys are welcome to some of these vittles.
- Obliged.
These men are going to bed down for the night, Edgar.
Come on in boys.
I want you to meet, Otis, Vern and ahhhh..Wes. Joe and Boise.
Did you get any boys? Huh?
Critters.
No, no, we didn't get any.
A few droppings, that's all we seen.
-Well beans and biscuits is it.
-That'll be fine, thank-you.
They is a bunch on a scout, if I've ever seen any.
-Ain't no five ever rode out alive out of that shack.
- We could run for it.
What for? They don't want no trouble and we don't want no trouble.
How about "fell on his knife".
Yeah, that's a lou-lou.
No, they figure we are just cowhands passing through, that's all.
We are.
They won't start nothing.
They seen us coming sure. They could have picked us off easy, if they wanted to.
Hunting rabbits, ain't that one?
-Maybe you want to try and bring them in?
- Maybe you do Vern?
-It'll be light enough tomorrow.
-I'm ready right now.
North up around Wardello would be good for us.
-They know we ain't no cowhands.
-You're too worried boys.
I'd have picked them off original.
They don't want no trouble. Going to Waco, that's all they are.
-Make up a pretty good mess of beans.
-I didn't mind it.
Maybe you two ought to throw in with this bunch.
Sure is a softer line than what I've got.
Except I ain't anxious to wind up trimming a tree, like the one we seen.
I'll be pleased to part company myself.
Think we ought to put a watch on them?
No, we'll leave early.
You'd think they'd do something for that Adam.
-What they gonna do?
-Wonder if this spread's got any riders up this way?
They'll be lightening out just like us tomorrow.
-You gonna hook up in Seabar again?
- I don't know.
-I was wondering....
- It's a good outfit.
-How about you Wes?
- No.
-Down to Cain?
-Maybe.
-Didn't seem much to me.
- That's the way you seen it Vern.
Ever think about trying for a spread of your own?
Once or twice.
-You never get nothing growing.
-I've been doing it awile now.
Sounds like you want to squat.
-You ought to throw in with this bunch Wes.
-You do all the riding you want.
-Better than being afoot.
-He's got one there.
Don't seem crazy to me.
You start now Wes and you'd have something.
- I know it ain't crazy.
I'm going to think about it, as soon as we get out of here tomorrow.
Do you know what's close by?
Sierra Junction is a day or two south.
Sierra Junction? Is that the one I mean.
Got a place called "Golden Nugget" in there?
What don't? It's either the "Golden
Nugget" or the "Silver Dollar"....
...every place between here and
Rosie's Canteena.
You fixing to stop off?
I was wondering if it was the one.
You got something in there?
Mention a saloon and you start to dancing around.
I ain't even going to get started with you this morning, Vern.
-Bout ready to head out, are they?
Yeah. Anytime now.
I don't know.
-Are they still there?
-Yeah.
You think them fools would be bound......
All right! You're surrounded.
Don't make trouble for yourselves.
You got no chance.
-What'll we do Dick?
-We'll have to make our play right here.
What do you want with us?
I guess they'll hang us.
Throw out your weapons, and come on out now or we'll open fi re.
You got no chance.
We won't wait forever.
We'll open fire on three.
One.....
Two......
Don't go slow. Keep the other three pinned down and concentrate on the shack.
-We got to get out.
-How?
Hills are our only chance.
-Where do they go anyhow, on foot?
- It's all we got.
Going to be a long day.
-You want to try and ride through them?
-We'll use the horses to get us into the hills.
We're just sitting here waiting to get shot, or hung.
-What are they doing?
- Running back and forth looks like.
Ain't going nowhere with that.
Hold fire.
They ain't going anywhere up there.
We gotta get the rest of them smoked out before dark.
Sam, try and get up above the shack. Ward take some of your bunch and track the two that went up the canyon.
Now don't take chances. Just track them. They're killers.
Save it.
-I hope they follow us.
-Not me.
We wasn't doing nothing.
What's the matter with you?
-Nothing's the matter. Come on
-Where to?
I don't give a damn Wes. They'll hang you just the same with Otis dead.
Hold your fi re.
Throw down your guns and come out.
You have no chance. There's men above you.
We're going to burn you out.
What do you say?
All right. Your last chance.
Don't shoot. I'm coming out.
Got anything to say?
No?
We can't just keep going up.
We got to get down of f here.
I know the vigilantes know that.
They ain't playing Wes. They burned them all out.
Probably strung up by now.
They know we can't get over this.
I'm not going to hang Vern.
What do they think? Burn them out!
No chances.
They figured we couldn't get over this, so we'd come to them.
Just like the others done.
Probably marking a trail behind us.
Most of them are probably down at that necktie party for awhile.
We gotta try to go around them, or through them.
-You all right.
-Did you see them?
Must be only three or four up here.
Come on then.
Get on down and tell Quint that they're moving west across the face and that you think you winged one of them. And we'll just stay low until they box themselves in.
It's going to begin to get chilly up here in a couple of hours.
-Supper Pa.
-Thank you. Tell your mother I'll be along.
-Good evening Catherine.
-Evan.
We thank you Lord for this food.
Your humble servants and we are grateful for this food. Amen.
It's very good. Tasty.
My feet. I'm afraid to look at them.
We got to keep going Wes. They track us easy in daylight, out in the open.
I can't walk much further.
They was up all night, I figure. The way they bush-whacked us this morning.
We get some horses and I think we're out of it Vern.
-If there was a town around here......
- We can't go into no town.
I know. But if there's a town nearby, there's got to be nesters or a small ranch or something.
You figure we lost them?
I figure we got to fi nd a place to hide before the sun comes up tomorrow and this ain't it.
Be a shame to do all this walking for nothing.
Your one day ahead of the game already. Better blisters than neck burns. Come on.
Hello inside. Can we have a word with you?
-Stay here.
-Be careful.
-What can I do for you? - We are part of the
Citizens Vigilant Committe neighbor. You seen anything peculiar out here?
-No, you two are the only things I seen today besides my family and a skunk.
-There are two killers lose out here.
They're part of a gang. Got all of them, but these two, and strung them up today.
-Headed this way?
- No telling.
They're on foot. One might be wounded.
-All right if we take a look at your stable there?
- Step down.
-Can I offer you men coffee? I got a jug of corn-whiskey inside.
- That'd be fine, thank-you, after we look around.
Abigail!
Bring out the corn-whiskey.
Thank-you Abby.
-This is my daughter Abigail.
-Good-evening Miss.
I guess they ain't here.
-Would you care to come inside?
-Well no thank-you. We'll go along now.
We got to track these birds down.
Obliged for the drink.
A pleasure meeting you Miss.
-Cute little piece, wasn't she Roy?
-Ain't nothing wrong with her.
I'll be getting back this way, I believe.
Don't make a sound, hear me?
Sit down.
You just sit there, real quiet and you'll be fine.
We don't aim to hurt nobody.
Pardon me. We are chowing down.
Well, you see, we ain't eat since yesterday morning.
This is good.
-May I prepare the food?
-Sure.
Good for our sakes, we came by last night.
-What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I was just rying to figure out what way to run?
-Would you like some coffee?
-Much obliged.
That's a pretty big stump out there.
-What's funny?
-Nothing.
-When's he come in?
- Abigail fetches him for dinner.
-When's that usual?
-When the grubs ready, that's all.
-They track us here, we ain't got a chance.
- This is going to be a long enough day, without you going on.
-I think we should take the horses now.
-Those vigilantes are spread out all over this country.
It's ready, the food's ready.
-She goes on out huh?
-That's what she usually does.
-Well sure, you do what you done before, that'd be fine.
-Abby, do like they say.
Your mother will be in here with us.
She's there.
-Dinner Pa. Thank-you Abby.
- Tell your mother, I'll be along.
-She's coming back.
-You sit right there ma'm.
-You did fine.
-I forgot the wash-up.
- He always washes up.
-Abby!
-Yes Pa.
-Where's my wash-up?
Tell him you'll get it.
I'm sorry Pa. I'll get it.
What's gointg on inside there with you women?
Quick!
-What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry Pa, I forgot.
Don't move.
-Got something?
- I'm done with the, all night.
-It might be all day.
- Yeah, most of us are.
-They might not have come out of those mountains.
-Well, what do you want to do?`
What are you going to do?
Well they didn't come out between here and the narrows, then they're not coming out or....
They got over. Slipped past us.
Think I'll ride on ahead to them squaters and get a meal.
Roy told me about that "meal".
-I join you when I catch up. Is that all right with you?
- Sure, the shape you're in, you ain't seeing nothing. We'll all pack in after the day.
Adios.
-Aren't you going to eat Evan?
-What do you want with us?
Nothing. Just don't want to make trouble.
-Listen Mister. We didn't do nothing.
-You're horse thieves.
You know that. You can't just come in here and take my stock.
What'll I have. How will I work?
-I'm going out to look at the horses.
-What for?
-I want to see them.
-What if someone comes riding by?
They ain't going to see me.
You keep him in here and I'll take her out with me.
-What for?
-What do you want with her? Don't think I'm him.
-This ain't no social Wes.
-You said it was.
All right, I won't take her. No, go ahead and take her.
All I'm doing is looking at your horses.
That's all Mister. I understand how you feel.
We ain't outlaws. We ain't!
You just sit tight a couple of hours, and then we'll be gone.
Don't make no trouble, is what's best for all of us.
Not bad animals.
You don't say much.
I was getting a little cabin fever
-You like it here?
- Can we go in?
My father don't like it if I talk to strangers.
He don't mean nothing to me.
-They're going to hang us. You think that's right?
- I don't know. It ain't up to me.
You just do what? What's right with your Pa? Is that all you care about?
I can't say.
-How old are you?
-18, I reckon.
-You wanting to steal our stock.
-That's ain't my problem.
-Tell them vigilantes, they're the ones.
- It's the wrong thing to do.
What's right? Hang? You tell me.
They killed the best friend I ever had.
We ought to go in.
When I say, is when I want to go in.
You going to eat that?
-Pretty good horses.
- As long as they get us out of this part of the country.
-You go out and beat that old stump to death, then I won't have to hear it.
- I want to stay in here.
Go out. Don't mean no trouble.
Look better if you out there working.
Don't worry about them.
-He sure is on the tick.
-Sure he's on the peck.
Stealing horses is all we mean to him. Can't blame him.
-You mind if I get some sleep Vern?
-Go on.
-This is my bed.
- No, go on.
-How long has he been going at that stump?
-Yesterday morning.
-You like it here?
It's all right.
-Kind of lonesome for a woman.
-Same as for a man.
-I reckon.
Seems to me what you do is lonesome.
I guess you'd be right. I don't know.
That man last night, said they hanged some of your bunch.
-It ain't my bunch ma'm.
-What are you going to do Vern, talk?
Ah, you can go to sleep. Beats me anyways.
Well I guess I can't.
If you ladies got anything to do, you go on.
Hey Wes, what was that with you and Cain?
-Damn, what do you want to do, talk is all?
- Better than sitting here all day listening to myself.
I don't know. You want to play checkers?
-You got any checkers.
- Yes we do.
Can we use them?
-Playing checkers.....Stealing horses.....
-What's the matter with you?
-Just don't seem to be no end to it.
- No use to that.
-Strikes me as peculiar just the same.
- Why's that?
Sitting here, playing checkers.
While there is a bunch of men out there, looking to string us up.
-Why don't you put a tune to it?
-We're in the scout boy.
You can't cash in, can you?
Getting strung up is better?
Nobody is just going to put a name to me, and that's it.
I'd like to take a whack at that stump myself.
Come on. Play!
I don't know. I'm going to think about it.
You'll never get nothing growing.
This is the less work I done on a weekday, since I was four.
Unelss I was sick.
-What's so funny?
-They ain't playing Wes.
They burned down my house.
-It's your move Vern.
-I know it.
-You're horse thieves.
- Indians?
-Well come on, play.
- Where you been at Vern?
I moved already.
He stopped. See what he's doing.
No, we ain't found them ain't.
Probably won't if we don't get them today.
-Where's your women folk?
- Inside. Baking today.
Baking? That right?
Well I out scouting. The main body is moving out this way.
What the hell they talking about Vern.
Well the side buster is spilling his beans.
-Something the matter with you?
-No.
You're acting mighty peculiar for nothing the matter.
-They're here!
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
-Where're they at? In the house?
-They got the women. What are we going to do?
Now, you don't look at the house.
You start pointing off behind me.
I'm just going to ease out of here and get some help.
Act like you're giving me directions to some place, like I'm just passing through.
You just go on back to work, like it was nothing.
Make them come out to you to fi nd out what happened.
Stall them.
-We going to leave him go?
-Well, ain't no other way.
Doing us a favor. Getting dumb- enough to go for whatever it is.
As soon as he's out of sight.
Stay inside.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, stay out of there.
They're taking our stock.
Hold it right there!
-What do you think?
-Take two men and fi nd out. It could be anything.
-We're sorry about this ma'm.
- I hope you hang them.
Don't worry. They've seen their last sunrise.
-One of them is shot.
-They won't get far now.
-Let me down.
-No we can't Vern.
I ain't going.
Two won't make it on that horse.
I bought it, Wes. Go on.
-I can't just leave you.
- You have to do that boy. Can't you see that?
Go on!
We got them now.
What about the other one?
Downloaded From www.MySubtitles.com
I'm gonna have to carry ya?
Come on.
Oh, boy.
All right. Drop your gun belt, mister.
What's this all about?
The captain said to drop the gun belt.
Now!
They're wearing the Johanson brand, all right, Captain Wilson.
Whose else would they be?
Where'd you get those cattle, mister?
Just where that brand says.
Got them from Johanson?
That's right.
And you've got a bill of sale to prove it?
Hold it!
That's right.
I thought maybe you'd like to look at the bill of sale.
We'll look at it.
You say you got this from Johanson?
Yeah.
Mr. Maddow.
Mr. Maddow, is that
Johanson's mark?
Johanson didn't have to make his mark.
He could write as good as you can.
Hang him.
Damn it!
Look, I'm an ex-lawman.
You can check with the sheriff,
Dave Ramsay of Saint Louis.
Get Johanson! Let him tell me face to face.
For God's sake, check it out!
Are we gonna hang him or beat him to death?
Enough!
Put him on his horse.
Wait a minute, the saddle!
You've no claim to that, Reno.
We got back Johanson's cattle, Captain, and we got the man that took them.
Now, I like to see justice done, but I'm taking the saddle.
Anybody want to argue?
If he's a rustler, he ain't got nothing I'd want.
Well, he's got something that I want.
I want his wallet. I want it, and I'm gonna take it!
Excepting if he's a rustler, how come he didn't make a run for it when he had a chance?
Wait a minute, Loomis.
Now, tell me.
You bought some cattle from Johanson.
You saw the bill of sale.
With the mark where Johanson was supposed to write his name!
Yeah.
What did Johanson look like?
He's about 30.
Dark hair, dark eyes, heavy-set.
Pockmarked face, regular features.
You have an eye for detail, haven't you?
I told you, I was a lawman.
That was my job.
Heavy-set, pockmarked, about 30.
Liar.
Johanson was 60.
Well, maybe it was his foreman, or something, I don't know.
But we can go back there and find out. It's only a day's ride.
We could check it out.
Mr. Maddow.
Tell him.
I just came from the Johanson place.
His herd was gone.
I found Johanson and his wife on the kitchen floor, gunned down.
Dead.
No.
Hang him.
You're making a mistake! No.
No!
Some people calls this hell, but you're still in Oklahoma territory.
Save your breath.
I don't know who hung you or why, but if you're innocent, the judge will set you free.
And if you ain't, they'll have to take the trouble of hanging you again.
So come on, get on your feet.
Water your mules and fill up a bucket of water for the men.
Marshal Dave Bliss. I hear you got a prisoner for me.
That's right, Marshal. Feed and grain store right across the street.
Here's the key.
You'll be needing it.
Marshal.
Watch out for him.
He's plumb loco.
Oh, God! Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
You've come to kill The Prophet.
Take it easy, will ya?
Oh, God! You've come to kill The Prophet!
Can you walk?
They're against me!
They spy on me.
Oh, God.
They're scared of the wrath of God!
Get on your feet.
No!
Come on!
Even the prison wagon's better than this.
You've come to kill
The Prophet!
Hold it!
Oh, no!
Oh, God! Oh, God!
You've come to kill The Prophet!
Damn you, hold it!
Stop or I'll kill ya!
Oh, God!
Well, what are you waiting for, Marshal? Shoot him!
Kill him!
What's wrong, Marshal?
Scared of cheating a hanging judge?
Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him! Kill him!
We'll look out for ya, Marshal!
We'll tell him you done your best to bring him in alive!
Kill him, Marshal!
Kill him, Marshal!
Yeah, kill him!
Kill him!
Come on, kill him!
Hold it, damn you.
Kill him, Marshal!
It's too damn crowded in here anyway!
Kill him, kill him.
Kill him, Marshal.
God!
You chained him.
Now you bury him.
That ain't gonna make the judge happy.
What was I supposed to do, let him escape?
I ain't saying you was wrong.
I'm just saying it ain't gonna make the judge happy.
Now that you've said it,
Williams, move them out.
Girls! Girls! The tumbleweed wagon's here! Come on!
Save us the live ones,
Marshal, huh?
Marshal, you're not gonna hang them all!
Here she is! Here comes that tumbleweed wagon!
And you'll send the drapery material over?
As soon as it comes in.
And I'll be needing more perfume.
A dozen bottles?
The cheapest, as long as it smells good.
It's not for my girls. It's for the Saturday night cowhands.
They come off the range smelling like...
Here come the tumbleweed wagon!
Hey, isn't that
Billy the Kid?
Take a closer look. Maybe you'll find your old man!
Hold it!
We're going outside of town, do some target practice on them!
All right, move them out.
Giddap.
Come on.
You eats twice a day, 8:00 in the morning and 4:00 in the afternoon.
Unless you makes trouble and get yourself short-changed, you get an hour a day recreation in the prison yard.
Better find yourself a spot.
Expecting another wagon in this afternoon.
You'll get used to the smell.
If you don't, they got a sure cure for it.
They hang ya!
Sounds like Schmidt's fixing to have a little party this morning.
A party?
A hanging party.
Them's 200-pound sacks he's dropping.
Gotta make sure them ropes hold up.
Always uses top-grade hemp, Schmidt does.
Oils it so it slides real good, snaps your neck like a dried-out twig.
Fine artist at his trade, our Mr. Schmidt!
That bastard!
No!
What kind of justice hangs a man before he's heard about his appeal?
No!
Come in.
Leave him.
Without shackles.
Yes, sir.
All right, guard.
Your story checks out, Cooper.
You're free to go.
And 40 cents. That's all McCleod had on him when we picked him up.
McCleod?
McCleod was running from the law, holed up at Johanson's place, killed that old man and his wife, and then you blundered in.
A stranger looking to buy some cattle, so McCleod sold you a few head.
He must've got a pretty good laugh out of that.
You wanna see what he looks like?
Come on.
Now, come on.
McCleod took the money he swindled from you and came into town, looking for a good time.
The row, that's where we found him.
May God have mercy on his soul.
You're free to go, Cooper.
With my $11.40?
And the satisfaction of seeing the man that got you into this mess hung.
What about the nine just men who hung me?
Just give their description to one of the deputies downstairs.
They'll try to pick them up.
Well, that's not good enough.
Cooper, you take the law into your own hands, and I promise you you'll swing from one of those ropes out there.
I know a little bit about the law, Your Honor!
That's right.
You do.
Sit down, Cooper.
Please.
You were a lawman in Saint Louis, a damn good one.
I can use a good man, Cooper.
Pay, 250 a month.
That's 230 more than you'd make as a cowhand,
232 more than as an army sergeant. Here.
That hanging rope didn't kill ya. Maybe my coffee will.
How much did you make in Saint Louis?
It's 200 more than
I made in Saint Louis.
250, plus expenses.
I warn you, the pay is a little slow in coming.
There. $200.
Plus 50 President Harrison owes you. You'll get it when I get it.
Seems like you're a man trying to give away money and don't have too many takers.
You sound like a man who is protesting the pay is too high. Don't.
You sign on, you'll earn every cent of it.
There you are.
The Oklahoma and Indian
Territory, year of our Lord, 1889.
Nineteen marshals. I was authorized 60 when I came here.
Told the president even that was not half enough.
Nineteen marshals and one court to cover near 70,000 square miles.
A happy hunting ground filled with bushwhackers, horse thieves, whiskey peddlers, counterfeiters, hide peelers, marauders that'll kill you for a hatband!
Now that's why there's a badge in my desk, Cooper, itching to sit on somebody's chest and no takers.
Your marshals do cover a lot of territory.
You'll ride circuit over an area half again the size of Rhode Island, if and when it's Marshal Cooper.
Pick up the badge,
Mr. Cooper.
Pick up the badge, or leave justice to me and my men.
Those nine men, if you find them, they're to be brought before me alive.
That old horse should hold you for a spell.
All right.
Good luck, Marshal.
Thank you.
You're Cooper?
Judge sent a wire you was coming.
Wasn't there nobody outside?
There's two men with shotguns.
I haven't had me a night's sleep since we picked up the Swede.
How many men did you bring with you?
Can you have him ready to go in a half hour?
Just the two of you?
Yeah.
The hotel here in town, does it serve a good steak?
I better have something to eat before we leave.
If you're crazy enough to try to take the Swede in alone, you got a right to try it on a full stomach!
You're under arrest, Reno.
You talking to me,
Marshal?
Your name's Reno, isn't it?
Look, Marshal, I don't know what kind of town you're running here...
This isn't my town.
Well, I wouldn't know.
See, I just rode in.
Now, I'm gonna wash down some trail dust, and...
All right, Marshal, what do you say I done?
You don't remember me, do ya?
No.
When you hang a man, you better look at him.
Don't go for that gun, Reno.
I need you alive.
Do you know him?
No.
Anybody here know him?
Goes by the name of Reno.
Come up here and take a look at him.
He must've just rode in.
That's what he said.
How much to bury him?
Elwood?
Well, I...
$15 ought to do a fair job, Marshal.
All right. There's $7 there, and I'll give you $8 more.
And mark it down there.
Don't anybody leave!
I want everybody to write down in this book exactly what they saw.
I didn't see nothing, Marshal.
Fine, then you say that in writing.
Nobody's gonna fault ya, Marshal.
You gave him every chance.
Then say it in writing.
Marshal, I can't write.
Well, the sheriff here will write it down, then you can put your mark on it.
Sheriff, there's a saddle out there belongs to me. I'll be taking that.
If any of his friends or relatives show up and want his horse or his belongings, you let me know.
You can wire me in Fort Grant.
You gonna pick up the Swede now?
No, no. I'm gonna have that steak now.
Marshal.
The Swede! That's the one the Marshal just brought in.
Swede!
What was that all about?
That's Judge Fenton's orders.
Nobody comes in or out that lady don't look at.
Marshal! Judge wants to see you right away.
Thank you.
Good work,
Cooper. See?
The good Lord takes care of those that do his work.
He just waltzed in here and gave himself up.
I never wanted to hang you, mister.
I asked them to give you a chance.
Maybe you remember that.
I remember that.
I was here in Fort Grant looking to pick up a grubstake when I heard a marshal with a hanging scar had killed Reno.
I knew then we...
We'd hung an innocent man.
So I turned myself in.
The others?
He gave me their names.
I've already made out the warrants for their arrest.
Where?
Red Creek.
Good. I'll be on my way.
All right, Cooper, you do it your way.
You round them up and bring them back.
I don't know why you had to kill Reno.
It's in my report.
I wanted him alive.
I needed these names.
You got your names.
Mister, you make sure the rest of those men get back here alive.
Jenkins? Sit down, please.
You're under arrest. Move!
I have seven warrants here.
Matt Stone, M. Loomis,
Maddow, Charlie Blackfoot,
Captain...
Captain Wilson? Say, what the hell is this all about?
A lynching.
Now, I understand four of these men I'm after are out at the Big W.
Maddow and Miller
I'm not sure about.
Maddow, he owns a spread around here.
Miller, he...
Miller's a drifter.
Look, Marshal, these men you're looking for, they're all leading citizens.
They're friends of mine.
Well, these friends of yours are wanted for conspiracy to commit murder.
Now, if you'll put this man in jail, Sheriff, you and I can ride out to the Big W.
Sheriff!
Sheriff Calhoun!
Sheriff!
Rustlers!
They took our herd!
They killed my pa and Danny.
Killed both of them.
I rode in and found them there.
Pa and Danny, bushwhacked!
And the herd gone.
I won't be much good to you from here on out.
My back is giving me trouble.
You're in good hands, however.
This man here is a federal marshal.
Don't give me that bad-back stuff. You got your job.
I've got mine out at the Big W.
His father and his brother's been murdered. You a lawman or ain't ya?
No more than five, six hours ahead now.
Now they must slow down.
Yeah, well, we won't.
On your feet! Get up!
Get up! Get up!
Cattle won't live another day without water.
Mick! Willie!
Head them home!
Rafe, go with them!
You've got one minute to pray.
There'll be no hanging here.
These men killed my father and brother.
They're gonna get what's coming to them.
They'll get what the law says is coming to them.
If you can't stomach hanging, why don't you ride out?
We'll do what needs doing here.
I'll say it one more time!
There's gonna be no hanging.
We're not turning three murderers loose.
That's right. You're turning them over to me, the law.
I'll make sure they get to Fort Grant.
Fort Grant's better than three days' ride from here.
You'll never make it alone, Marshal.
I didn't plan on making it alone.
Now, you men got a $10 posse fee coming, and I can't guarantee the government's gonna pay any more, but every man who sticks with me will get an extra 10, if I have to pay for it myself.
Uh-uh.
I'll take my 10 now.
I've got your name.
They'll send it to you.
We'll put in for the money ourselves, Marshal.
Yeah.
The men these rustlers killed, they were my friends.
These three, they are for hanging!
Leave us, Marshal.
For just 10 minutes.
Five minutes!
On your feet.
Thank you, Marshal.
I just want you to know, Marshal, we had nothing to do with the killing.
Shut up.
We rustled the herd all right, we did that, but me and Ben...
Didn't I tell you to shut your mouth, boy?
My brother's telling the truth, Marshal.
He done it.
All right, Marshal, all right.
All right, saddle up those horses, and nothing foolish.
You're very kind, Marshal.
Would you be my friend, too?
Forget about it.
Say, I...
I seen you when you drug that old Stone into jail.
I thought that was really something.
I just about died right then and there.
I picked up my two amigos here and rustled this fat herd, and we headed lickety-split for south of the border.
You know something,
Mr. Deputy Marshal?
You know, when I woked up and seen that gun pointing right at my mouth and you standing at the other end of it,
I said to myself, "Miller, you move one inch and you're a dead man.
"This man's about to blow your head off. "
I mean, what them boys said was right.
We're guilty as hell.
You know, when we get to Fort Grant, all they're gonna do is hang us.
I tell you what.
Why don't you be real smart and use your head, you know?
And let us go.
Just let us go.
We outnumber you three to one. You can tell them that we jumped ya.
And the boys and I, you know, we ain't gonna be around to call you a liar.
Get aboard, Miller.
I can't get aboard,
'cause my hands are tied.
You're gonna have to help me.
I said, get aboard.
You ain't never gonna get me alive to Fort Grant, boy.
Then I'll get you there dead, boy.
Get down.
The horses need rest.
Start walking.
Get aboard, Miller.
Kill me.
Kill me!
Please. Please. I didn't set out to touch her. I was drunk!
Full of rotgut whiskey. I didn't know what I was doing.
Please, my family!
Take him away.
What? No! Please!
My family! I didn't know what I was doing!
Please!
Samuel Dodd.
Charge, whiskey peddling.
Here, Your Honor.
Marshal Cooper's coming down the street with three prisoners.
Court's adjourned.
8:00 tomorrow morning.
All rise until His Honor has left the courtroom.
Sheriff in Red Creek wired you were bringing three killers in alone.
That was over two days ago.
I nearly gave you up for dead.
You're a damn fool, Cooper.
A bloody damn fool, and the best there is!
You hear that? Wake up, you godforsaken people, you!
The best there is, this man here that works for ya!
What's going on? Your government, our country, the best country there is because of men like Marshal Jed Cooper!
I'm proud of you, boy.
They're gonna hear about this, not just in the territories, but in Washington!
Across the length and breadth of this nation, they're gonna know that name,
Jed Cooper!
Well, what you do got to say about that, boy?
Yahoo!
Anything else I could do for you, Marshal?
Good Lord! You bring back half of these, you'll have a wagonload!
Well, you know me, Judge.
I like a lot of company.
How long you figure it'll take?
Six, seven weeks, give or take a month.
Come in!
Well, well, well!
Morning.
Morning.
The prodigal returneth from a fate worse than death!
Was that your idea?
You fell right in my arms, boy, and it's just the row happened to be the closest haven, and since you didn't appear to need a doctor's services...
Well, I'll be on my way.
See ya, Jed.
All right, Hayes.
Aside from the girl who served me breakfast,
I didn't see anybody else that I remembered.
Do I owe them a bill, or...
Of course! Just put it on your expense account.
Under what?
You're gonna make me one hell of a lawman, Jed. One hell of a lawman!
Judge, about those three that I brought in...
All taken care of. I don't think they spent as pleasant an evening as you did.
No, but, I wanted to talk to you about the two boys, Ben and Billy-Joe.
Later, later, later. Write it down when you got time.
I just wanted to say, as long as I'm here, that only Miller is to be charged with murder.
See, if it wasn't for those two boys, I might not have made it.
Miller tried to kill me.
If one or both of them had pitched in and given him a hand...
They pitch in to help you subdue Miller?
Well, no, but... All right.
Write it in your report.
Hey, Marshal!
If you catch a whiskey peddler, let him go and bring the whiskey back this time!
Hey, Ace! Mind if I call on that señorita of yours?
I hear they got some wicked women in Los Gatos!
Catch us a few!
So long, Ace! Good hunting!
Bliss is dead.
Bliss? What happened?
He went to pick up one of the
Walker boys out of the Elmwood jail.
The Walker clan, all seven of them, were waiting.
They shot him down, right there, in the middle of the main street.
Not a soul in Elmwood lifted a hand to help him.
Yeah, I owed my life to Bliss.
He was a man with a backbone, a lawman.
It won't be easy to fill his shoes.
No, it won't.
Well, I'd better get on back to Red Creek.
Red Creek?
Yeah, when the local sheriff wired you, I don't suppose he told you that I arrested one of the men who tried to lynch me.
I was going after the rest of them when this business came up.
The man you arrested?
Name's Stone.
He's in the Red Creek jail.
Good. That ought to hold him till you're finished here.
Finished here?
Testifying.
Testifying? When?
Boy, I got a backlog of cases built up from here to Sunday!
Well, I happen to have a prisoner over there in that cardboard jail, and the sheriff who's guarding him got a bad back, and if I don't get back over there...
You'll get back, Cooper!
You'll get back when I tell you you're free to go.
Cooper.
You can be the best I've ever had, the best there is, if you remember this.
You work for the government!
You work for justice!
Come in.
Rachel?
Excuse me, Judge.
I heard there were three new prisoners.
Yes.
Marshal, why don't you take Miss
Warren down to the cell block?
Two of them are just boys.
Old enough to rustle cattle.
You want them to hang?
I just want them to get a fair trial. Who do you want to hang?
We all have our ghosts, Marshal.
You hunt your way,
I hunt mine.
All right, you claim you didn't pull the trigger.
Let's forget about the killings.
Rustling is a hanging offense, and they are all guilty, all three of them!
No matter whose idea it was, they're all guilty.
That's the law.
Object!
Sustained.
You, sir.
You will elicit facts from the witness.
I will tell the jury what's the law.
Yes, sir.
No further questions,
Your Honor.
The jury will disregard all of the prosecution's remarks concerning the law.
All right, son.
You may step down now.
Call your next witness.
Marshal Jedediah Cooper!
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but, so help you God?
I do.
Marshal, at the time of their apprehension, did any of these three defendants deny their guilt?
Well, no, but on the trail back here...
Marshal, we're not interested in the trip back to Fort Grant.
It was a heroic journey.
The whole court, the whole territory, is grateful.
Your Honor, I think something that happened on the trail back here has a bearing on the case.
Something happen that leads you to believe that one or all three of these defendants are innocent?
Well, of murder, yes. You see, both Ben and Billy-Joe told me...
Marshal, this court is not concerned with hearsay evidence.
This court requires facts.
The defendants, all three, are charged with murder and rustling. Facts, the only matter that concerns this court.
I thought this court was concerned with justice.
Justice is my province,
Marshal! Mine, and mine alone!
Now, you'll confine yourself to giving direct answers to direct questions or find yourself in contempt of court! Proceed.
One of those boys is 18, the other's only 16.
That'll cost you $10. Neither one of them's been in trouble...
$20. ... with the law.
If it wasn't for them...
$30! One more word, you'll spend 30 days in the hole.
Do you have any further questions for this witness?
No more questions,
Your Honor.
Then you may step down, Marshal.
Yeah?
Sheriff Ray Calhoun,
Red Creek.
I recognize you.
I wanna congratulate you on the job you did bringing in those rustlers.
You mean, you rode all the way over here from Red Creek, bad back and all, just to tell me that?
No.
Stone's dead.
What happened, Calhoun?
It didn't make no sense, him sitting in that cell going crazy in a town without no blacksmith.
He promised that if I'd turn him loose every day for a couple of hours to work at his trade that he'd come back to his cell each night.
And he did, came back every night but one.
I rode out to his home, a home where I had many a dinner, the home of a friend.
I had to bring him back and put him in his cell at gunpoint.
He made a break for it.
I tried to shoot low, but I'm not very good at that.
I heard you paid 800 to the skunk who murdered the Johansons and sold you their herd.
That's right.
How much did you get back when they were caught?
There's 800 in this envelope. It's yours.
Or you can keep the 100 head.
Prime, every one of them.
I don't have much use for cattle these days.
Here's 10.
Keep it.
Hold it!
Here's $11.40 for the aggravation they caused me.
Now, you take that bad back of yours right over to Red Creek and tell your friends we're even, money-wise.
So, it's no deal.
He figures you still owe him for a lynching.
And I told you, you never should've offered him the money.
All right.
Now that makes three mistakes we made: the money, we hung an innocent man, and we didn't finish the job.
We can't undo the first two, but we can still finish the job.
I didn't hear that,
Captain Wilson.
I didn't hear none of it.
I'm riding back to Red Creek.
Are you coming with me?
Charlie! You've been with me better than five years.
Good years, Captain.
Maybe if it was my land
I was fighting to hold...
No, Captain. If that marshal wants Charlie
Blackfoot, he's gonna have to find him.
Sorry, Captain Wilson.
Maddow, you're damn near my age.
You wouldn't last six months in that jail!
I don't intend to try to.
I can still ride pretty good.
You can shoot even better!
I'm sorry, Captain.
Maddow, he'll come after you.
He'll keep coming. You'll be nothing but an animal, an animal running scared!
Sorry, Captain.
How about you two? You sure?
Tommy?
It was wrong to hang that man.
We all know it now.
I was hoping we could square it with him.
My wife, she was kinda hoping it, too.
Loomis?
I'm 37, 38. I don't rightly know for sure.
I started drifting when I was just a kid.
These last few years working for you, it's the first home
I ever knew.
I've saved a few dollars, thinking of finding myself a woman, staking out a few acres of my own, when this come up.
You mean, when I brought it up.
You didn't force me to ride with you, Captain.
I thought we was doing the right thing. We was.
Hanging the wrong man don't change that.
Five years, even 10, you two can survive it and still come out to live some kind of life.
What kind, Captain?
I been a free man. It's the only kind of life I know.
My wife Thelma, she's a young woman.
She wants kids and a family.
Even if I asked her to wait for me, even if she said she would,
I couldn't be sure.
Let's ride, gentlemen.
Hey, mister, where's the hotel?
Down the street. But keep going, it's full up.
The whole town's full up with this hanging.
I hear they got tents set up out in the boondocks.
Well, thank you kindly. Giddap!
Who is it?
Open up.
I just came here, Your Honor, to tell you about the biggest thing that happened in this territory, bigger than statehood!
People showing up by the wagon full, men, women and children, all just to see your lousy hanging.
That's enough, Cooper.
To see your circus, a six-man hanging.
I said, that's enough!
You stink of whiskey, son. Just go back to your room. Lie down. Sleep it off.
You're lynching those boys. Why?
Why?
Yeah.
Because of you, Cooper.
Because of that beautiful, that magnificent journey you took to bring three killers to justice.
Because if the law didn't hang them, the next posse that goes out would say,
"Hang them, and hang them high!
There's no justice in Fort Grant. "
And if there's no justice in Fort Grant, Cooper, there'll be no statehood for this territory.
Well, I don't care how you slice it.
Whether it's nine men out on a plain with a dirty rope or a judge with his robes on in front of the American flag, those boys are gonna be just as dead as if they'd been lynched.
That's right, Cooper, just as dead.
But they won't have been lynched.
They will have been judged.
And if you can't see the difference, you better take off that star, and right now!
Not just yet,
Your Honor.
Yes, we'll gather at the river
The beautiful, the beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God
Shall we gather at the river
Where bright...
Get your cold beer here!
Sarsaparilla for all the kiddies!
Pretzels! Licorice sticks!
Get your cold beer! Cold beer!
Rachel, last chance, drapes can wait. Sure you won't change your mind?
Sophie, I told you before. There's only one hanging I'm interested in.
Soon our pilgrimage will cease
Soon our happy hearts will quiver
With the melody of peace
Dad, please!
No! I said no!
...at the river
The beautiful, the beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God
Cold beer! Sarsaparilla for all the kiddies!
Hey! Hey! Pretzels! Licorice sticks!
Get your cold beer! Get your cold beer here! Sarsaparilla for all the kiddies!
Pretzels, licorice sticks. Get your cold beer! Cold beer! Right here.
Cold beer! Right here.
Sarsaparilla for the kiddies!
Cold beer! Here's your change.
Here's your change. Cold beer!
Here's 5, here's 10.
Cold beer!
Sarsaparilla for the kiddies.
Licorice sticks. Cold beer!
Sarsaparilla for all the kiddies.
There you are, young thing.
Hey, what are you doing?
Can't you please see me tomorrow?
I don't want to miss the hanging!
"And the Lord said,
'Acknowledge thy sins unto me,
"'confess thy iniquities and transgressions unto the Lord,
"'and he will forgive thee thy sins. "'
Now, Preacher?
Patience, patience.
"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,
"nor standeth in the way of sinners,
"nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
"But his delight is in the law of the Lord,
"and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
"And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water
"that bringeth forth his fruit in his season.
"His leaf shall not wither,
"and whatever he doeth shall prosper. "
Amen.
We will now sing
Rock of Ages.
Get your cold beer and your sarsaparilla for all the kids, right here!
Rock of ages
Cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee
Let the water and the blood
From thy wounded
Side which flowed
Be of sin the double cure
Save from wrath and make me pure
While I draw this fleeting breath
When mine eyes shall close in death
When I rise to worlds unknown
And behold thee on thy throne
Rock of ages
Cleft for me
Let me hide myself in thee
Do you have last requests?
Do you have last requests?
I'd sure like me a chaw of tobacco.
What's the matter, hangman?
You afraid I'll choke and cheat you out of your hanging fee?
Mmm.
Put it in my pocket.
Mmm! Mmm!
Now, Preacher?
You may say your piece now, Duffy.
You are now looking for the last time at the mortal body of Francis Elroy Duffy, born to John and Edna Duffy...
Do you have last requests?
...good, God-fearing folk, who raised me up to be a good man...
Ben?
... a good Christian...
Bye, Ben. Bye. a good husband to my beloved wife, a good father to my children, whom I leave behind, hoping that they and all you will learn...
Do you have last requests?
...this here lesson which I leave you with.
When you take the devil into your mouths, you are doomed!
For he is lying there in wait for you inside that bottle of whiskey, waiting for you to take him into your mouth...
Do you have last requests?
...waiting to get down into your guts...
Tell him to shut up and let's get it over with.
...where he can do his devil's work.
Liquor is the most foul, evil thing in this here world!
It destroyed good men like myself.
It'll destroy you, too.
Do you have last requests?
And beer is not much better.
It's slower and cheaper.
No!
So take these words of advice.
And remember, you heard them from a poor sinner got no more cause to lie,
'cause he's going to meet his Maker.
And now he's ready.
Well, that's all
I've got to say.
Will you all bow your heads in one final prayer?
May God have mercy on their poor souls, as he has upon all the faithful departed.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Dear God!
All right, all right,
I'm coming!
Judge Fenton.
I come to praise Sophie, not to close her down.
I thought maybe you came to...
Now, Sophie.
Now, now, now.
Well, now at least I know what it takes to get you in here.
How is he this morning?
I've never seen a man who has more right to be dead.
I gotta see him right now,
Sophie. Can't wait any longer.
Check with Rachel.
She's still in charge.
She stayed all night?
You heard, Doc. If Rachel hadn't stopped the bleeding...
As it was, somebody had to stay with him.
A couple of my girls volunteered.
Rachel wouldn't have it.
Same room. Honeymoon suite, at the head of the stairs.
Thanks, Sophie.
Good morning, Judge.
Good morning, dear.
Anything I can do for you? No, no. No, no. Thank you, dear.
It's all right, Judge.
I'm just about finishing up.
I heard about what you did, Rachel. I'm grateful.
Why don't you sit down?
Can I get you something?
No, no, thank you.
I shouldn't have done this.
I may never get up again!
Who did it, Jed?
Much as you want them, Jed,
I want them more. I need them!
It's bad enough when a deputy gets bushwhacked on some lonely trail, but here, in Fort Grant, broad daylight?
We can't let them get away with that.
Now, who did it?
I'll go after them myself.
For the love of God, son!
God's got nothing to do with it.
I'll take care of them.
Want me to take over?
No.
Thank you.
You could use a good night's sleep.
All right, honey, but one of these days he's gonna get better, and you're gonna have a man on your hands.
You're perspiring.
Don't drink your milk so fast.
You look tired.
Are you all right?
You know you're a nag?
A very pretty one, but a nag.
What was that for?
Just thanks.
You're welcome.
I'll get some salt for the eggs.
Forget the salt.
Please.
Please don't.
Yeah, well, I guess...
I guess my life isn't worth two kisses, huh?
Please.
I'm sorry.
What's the matter?
I was married, back in Denver.
His name was Paul.
He was a doctor and a very fine man.
He used to say this was his place, this was where doctors were needed.
One night, after we'd camped, we sat around the fire, talking, husband and wife talk about how many children we were going to have, and what a wonderful life we were going to have together.
And then they came.
Two men on horseback.
Just some food.
Just to share our food, that's all they wanted.
And one of them put his hand on me.
And there was a shot.
And Paul was dead.
And they just left him there lying beside me on the ground, dead.
And they took me.
And took me.
And took me!
The tumbleweed wagon?
The jail? You're looking for those men?
And what happens when you find them?
Or if you don't find them?
Ever?
We'd better hurry!
It's gonna storm!
Miss Rachel, where do you want to put these blankets?
What is it, Marvin?
Where do you want these blankets?
Just put them in the back someplace.
Yes, ma'am.
Hi, Marshal!
You asked me once whether
I could ever stop looking.
I think now I can.
Can you?
Well, Rachel, there's a difference.
You see, I'm not...
I'm not looking for ghosts.
The end of my trail's in Red Creek.
Maybe not.
What then?
I don't know.
Think we got him?
I don't know.
The dog or the shot, either one.
Why ain't that dog yapping?
If that marshal was alive that dog would be yapping, wouldn't he?
I told you I didn't know!
But I aim to find out.
No! Let him come to us.
No, Captain. I've waited on him long enough.
Why don't he move?
Tommy!
Drop it.
Dead. Captain Wilson, Tommy,
Loomis, all of them, dead.
All except Maddow, Blackfoot, and you, Jenkins.
Count me dead, too.
I just want to say that
I don't hold you to blame, for what that's worth.
It's worth something.
So that's how it is?
That Rachel lit a fire in you with that rich body of hers.
You lit a fire in each other.
Now you're going to get married and raise cattle and kids.
Devil take the rest of the world.
Maybe.
You used the law and a badge to heal that scar on your neck.
Well, how many men are you going to have to hang to heal your scar?
Go to hell, Cooper.
I've already been there, Judge, in your wagon and in that hole you call a jail.
And old man Jenkins is gonna die there.
Is he sick?
He's dying.
I'll get a doctor down there for him.
Let him go!
So he can go on and look for another innocent man to lynch?
He's an old man.
Well!
And that was an old rope he helped put around your neck, but it came damn near to killing you, didn't it?
What's the matter with you, Cooper?
You got Jenkins on your conscience?
Think I judged him too harshly, used him like a piece of kindling for my fire of justice?
Well, maybe that's inevitable when there's only one man, one court with the power of final justice over a territory five times the size of most states!
Mistakes? I've made them,
Cooper, don't you doubt it.
Don't you doubt either there are times sitting up there in that judgment seat
I've wished, I have prayed that there was someone standing between me and God almighty, someone with the power to say,
"You're wrong, Fenton.
You made a mistake in law.
"This man here deserves another trial,
"this man here a reprieve, and this man is innocent!"
But until this territory becomes a state, with a governor and a state court of appeals,
I'm the law here, all the law.
And if you don't like that, you can cuss me till hell freezes over.
Or you can join me, Cooper.
Even fight me!
Help me turn this godforsaken territory into a state where no one man calls himself the law.
I want that old man pardoned.
You pick up your badge.
Tonight. Right now.
You take this down.
Give it to one of the guards down there.
If there are any questions, you tell them to see me.
There'll be no questions.
Cooper?
Charlie Blackfoot was seen in the town of Ridgeway.
I got two unfilled warrants here.
Blackfoot and Maddow.
The law still wants them.
THE MERCENARY
Paco Roman became a clown.
Better a clown living than a dead hero.
Me, Sergei Kowalski Polish emigrant,
I have always said.
Early in our history,
Paco was a simple  peon.
But a peon like no other.
It's Sunday.
It is not expected to have more to eat?
Look, amigos.
Today was meat.
He's right.
We are all housed in the same boat.
It's true.
Swallow it and you can endure anything.
People no longer speak that of Francisco Madera.
- Who is it?
- A less than nothing.
It seems that everyone is equal home.
So I brought you our lunch.
Eat, prompted.
So what?
You're not hungry?
Come on, taste it to me.
It's good, eh?
He ate it.
He ate it!
Cheers!
Stealing the rich to give to the poor,
it does not please the rich.
I ate well so I do not care.
You'll find this bitter lesson.
As far as what did you eat?
Go ahead.
Charge!
- Pepote!
- Come.
Not far away is the bar of Curly.
It is rich, powerful.
Is the boss.
Thirty... and that's it.
I lie.
Four jacks.
Two ladies.
With those two... that makes four.
- Are you kidding?
- In case...
There is this.
Thank you.
September!
Sorry, man.
Place your bets, try your luck.
Come on, we relaunch the dice.
September!
The dice.
The result?
Sept.
Another seven, right?
Do you like milk?
Not really, no.
- A glass of milk.
- It works.
Hold.
I must drink?
- Thank you.
- The dice.
Here's to you.
Is better.
When they emerge, do you use it more.
Pay those who have been cheated.
What do you drink?
It's on the house.
The Polack!
If you seek me, you might stay there.
- You'll burn your fingers.
- I have gloves.
I do not see them!
I have removed because I shoot better without.
We can no longer drink a drink in peace.
Little scamp.
Hello, Curly.
Talk about a surprise!
I had not seen you.
- He is the Polack?
- It will help us.
The revolution will break out Mexico.
We have silver mines Sierra in Palo.
Armed gangs attack any convoy.
We have accumulated seven tons of money.
It should convey the Sierra Palo...
- In Mexico City?
- No.
My brother, Alberto Garcia, wants to send money United States.
He is willing to pay $ 400 plus $ 100 per week for someone like you,
Mr. Kowalski.
Why you do not ask the army?
My brother thinks that with you, money is sure to happen United States.
- How?
$ 1 000 deposit, more than 200 per week, more travel and food.
- That's your money.
- The revolution has begun.
This is serious.
It will be a risky journey.
Enforcement is delayed.
Looks like the Poles hooked a big fish.
Now I am interested in Mexicans.
In fact, you're nervous, you could miss your shot.
As earlier.
He'll pay.
I so promise, Curly.
Are you married?
I am divorced.
- Children?
- No.
All right.
Plays. Fire!
Resting.
Go open the door.
Good evening, darling. Between.
Between amigo.
The girls are pretty.
You are American?
Want a girl or a drink?
I was told that you sold weapons.
If I'm not mistaken.
Get out all.
This man comes to talk business with Pepote.
This way.
I have Colt, of Winchester, the Mauser.
Or a nice gun.
- The machine gun.
- It's funny.
Rather, the Americans selling weapons.
The new model by Hawkins.
300 strokes per minute.
I bought it for a good cause.
But when the heart gets involved...
I sell everything cheap.
All.
I am the to 2,000 pesos only.
- 1000 or nothing.
- Go to 1000.
Good morning.
- Hello.
- Hello, Señor .
Which of you order?
Me.
I am Elias Garcia.
This is one of my brothers.
Did you hear?
The other did not use to us.
I have no time to lose.
What mission have you given to the Polack?
What a Polack?
I do not understand...
Don Elias is shy.
Help him, Sebastian.
This valley is infested with vultures.
They would soon devouring a corpse.
Where did the Polack and why?
Mine of Palo Alto.
My brother recruited him to convey money.
You will not need money... where you go.
Hello, gringo.
Hands in the air.
Approach.
Gently.
Keep your hands in the air.
Go!
What are you looking here?
One of the brothers Garcia.
Alfonso.
He was lucky.
This is his cousin who hanged himself there.
It recognizes the least.
I had to ferry the money, but given the situation,
I assume that money eventually into your hands.
What do you know about money?
I had to bring it through the border.
You know what makes this type finally hanged?
Not?
I'll show you.
Look.
Here the mine where the money and there, the gentleman detonated dynamite.
An entire mountain separates us money now.
I did hang and I dig.
- How many are you?
- Twelve.
Paco Roman and his twelve apostles.
You should stir.
Working 24 hours 24, you will... ten years, to pretty much.
Where are you going?
I go out.
My task is finished.
It's a strange story which begins with a treasure which disappears when they found it.
You speak well.
As a priest.
Or a high-flying swindler.
I know the crooks, they do not talk like you.
Who are you?
You're fast.
Who are you?
Sergei Polish.
If they keep me out, I'll kill you.
It will not help.
They do not care you kill me or not.
- You know count to ten?
- Yes.
I know also add, subtract and divide.
Fine.
Starts counting.
I want to just ten, they drop their guns.
One, two, three...
The guys...
Good going...
What have we here?
Decidedly, you have no chance.
Why?
What does it say?
It is addressed to Garcia.
A whole troop of soldiers is underway.
Guess who's headed?
A Garcia.
Colonel Alfonso Garcia.
It's a trap.
A machine gun.
You, there!
Come!
Come and help me to assemble it!
I do not work for nothing.
You are willing to pay?
- How?
Sort of...
Well, here it is, your money.
Profiteer!
I take over.
Rafael!
Provides ammunition.
It will do nothing against their guns.
How does it work?
You, you know how to use it!
Draw is not assembled.
200 more.
All right.
Here, 200!
We have them.
First line, load!
We need to find dynamite.
There must have.
Will see in the mine.
Okay. Roberto.
- Put it here.
- What for?
They believe it has more ammunition.
Go!
They no longer fire.
Attack.
Hurry up and up.
What for?
Confront the army, but to our advantage.
- It goes where?
- Right on the guns.
Jumps.
Cheers, gringo!
You're a military genius.
The only one helping me.
I almost get you down!
You would not have helped me against these bastards.
You would have killed anyone.
I had my gun in your back.
Yes.
I was wondering...
Why gringo does not kill me?
I thought...
I thought...
It is not on their side?
I'm on one side:
Mine.
You have praised my services.
What's more...
I pity you.
I have no need for me to complain.
Do not repeat it.
One day you'll lose your head.
That annoy me have to complain too when you're dead.
You talk as fast you pull.
Cheers, guys!
Here's to you, gringo.
Long live the revolution!
What it is?
To kill the leaders to strip.
There is not that much, right?
The speech this is not my forte.
I saw my father die in these mines.
My brother also.
But not me.
I'll die not in there.
I will make the revolution.
I'm doing well, right?
No.
I was given this for you.
You have learned the rules?
When one follows the rules, you lose.
You travel light.
Where is the money?
I paid dearly for that information.
Do not you, Curly?
You're wasting your time.
Forget the money.
You're a hard, Polack.
But I know how soften people, even people like you.
You'll see.
Let's go.
Sebastian!
We've been looking for breakfast.
Why you left so early?
I'm an early riser.
I have not forgotten the money.
I need you alive.
But not him.
It makes what?
I would take him his boots... and everything else.
Good idea. Go ahead!
Enough is enough.
Let him enough to go home.
Naked, it must be hideous.
Queue.
He told you to spin.
We'll Meet Again and I will kill you...
Mexican.
Fits well.
I want the machine gun.
- Anything else?
- You are a clever, you.
We could team up.
Teach me to make the revolution.
Comprehensive program.
You will not be rich enough.
Half.
Half of our treasure.
It's pretty, right?
Forget the treasure and listen to me.
It does not exist.
Give me the money, the true,
I can see and touch.
That's all that interests me.
Say 200 per day.
Plus costs.
Prepaid.
Give everything you have.
With the help of gringo, the country's banks are ours.
Not true, gringo
This is a good investment.
Rafael!
I have nothing more to invest.
I lost everything.
You see, if you ask nicely, we can have everything.
Your learning began.
First, we never turn back to a type that has robbed.
Deuzio, leave here before the army arrives.
Many will.
Started!
You too, Rafael.
We are an army.
1. CAVALRY
One, two, one, two...
Section... Stop!
Left... left!
2. Infiltrate the POST
COMMAND
3. BUGLE
4. GUN
5. BANK
Come out, you are free!
Sauté the locks.
These boots are too tight.
There's not much.
3000 or 4000 in notes, over 2,000 gold.
I owe you...
2800 for both last week, right?
Exact.
No tickets.
Happy to be free?
Leave the police to find the bandits
I'm not jumping for joy.
- Your name?
- Colomba.
- We are not bandits.
- Of course.
You are revolutionaries, I know music.
My father was one.
He eventually hanged.
But he would never have recruited a stranger.
This is not a gringo like the others.
This is my employee.
He told me what to do.
The money is enough for me.
This is to you, General.
Say your speech and draw us.
The food and supplies held by the State belong to the people, that is to say to you!
Those who want help the revolution closer!
Long live the revolution!
The success is mixed.
I want to help.
Nothing keeps me here.
Take all uniforms.
I have an idea.
Not stay planted there.
Do what he says.
Colomba, if you want to follow us, help us.
You are military elite of this country.
The rebels are exhausted.
We will overcome and eliminating their leaders.
You smile?
An article in the newspaper?
What has he?
- The rebels.
- Where?
Here.
One movement and you become a victim of the revolution.
Are you ready?
I am ready, Paco.
You can reach your regiment.
It's 30 km walk.
It is not long for a soldier of the republic.
The bag of the barracks we reported 26,000 pesos over 10,000 of the train attack.
How much is that?
5600 dollars.
4 weeks of pay.
And that?
No, repackages it.
Go.
So the hero?
A revolutionary not ashamed of his actions.
A thief like you, though.
I am not a thief.
I liberated this city.
This is the salary of my army.
This is theft.
Nothing else.
You are going away, soldiers return, they will take revenge, and these people will be alone again.
What has he?
It is you, the liberator.
They want to cheer you.
- Money.
- I'm on it.
Welcome to our city.
- Paco Roman Vive!
- Fear not, thief.
They take you to Simon Bolivar.
Show yourself.
It is rich, tonight!
Rich and happy!
Rich and happy!
What will happen tomorrow?
What?
You have my word.
It is.
There remains.
A drink.
You drank all night.
You too think too much?
You'll see.
It is wrong to think too much.
Everything depends on what you think.
You think like me?
I am sure General.
Let's go see it together.
Who is it?
The army is coming this way.
A whole regiment.
We'll see tomorrow.
By the way...
It is that this Simon Bolivar?
And what does that mean, make a revolution?
Make a revolution?
At the head, there are leaders, those who work other.
The rich.
Below, there are the poor.
The revolution aims at unity.
Gather the top and bottom.
Malin, the Bolivar.
They are brought together and it is the revolution?
It's impossible.
As you see, rich and poor are well separated.
I see.
I'm with the poor.
It should be ready in 10 minutes.
- The machine gun is next.
- No.
What, no?
No, that's all.
I must stay here.
You're still drunk.
You're going to sober up quickly when he saw the guns.
That's why I stay.
I have to protect these people.
These pigs Republicans not scare me.
I will fight with one hand.
Of course, general you're a big boy.
It is found in Sonora.
If you drop these pigs Republicans back and deep pockets.
Why?
Next time, my rates have increased.
Poor Paco .
You think you're Bolivar.
You became an idealist.
The shortest path to the cemetery.
And for lunch?
30 eggs, 2 sliced?? ham,
4 pounds of cheese
40 loaves of bread at a minimum, and 30 bottles of beer.
Especially beer.
All... this is for you?
Do not ask a man that pays well.
Of course, everything you want.
I will not ask anything.
You are right.
Paco is on its way.
Looking for me, that's for sure.
Hello, Señor.
Sleep well?
Yes, thank you.
You have everything ready?
Yes, señor .
Everything is ready.
Hams, the loaves of bread,
30 bottles of beer, as expected, generally.
Captain.
Yes... Captain.
Get out of there.
Shall we?
Get out of there, it will cool.
There were too many.
Everything went wrong.
Curly was with them.
The guy we did not kill.
I know what you're thinking, the Polack.
I offer you twice.
I do not do credit.
Ira.
You're an honest man.
Listen, Paco, I can make you as famous that Pancho Villa or Zapata.
I can make you all rich, but I want to be left carte blanche.
What do you mean?
Do not worry, I've thought of everything.
I we have prepared a small contract.
"First,
"I will be the sole judge military decisions.
"Deuzio,
"During the contract period,
"Not exceeding 8 weeks,
"Whatever the circumstances,
"I hereby Sergei Kowalski
"Will be housed in a tent or shelter
"And receive food and tobacco according to my whim.
"Tercio,
"My hand will be charged before the other.
"My salary
"Climbs to 200% its starting value.
"This money will come
"Of property confiscated during our revolutionary acts."
Sign.
If you lower your trousers before the Poles, why not add women to the list?
Paco Roman will provide you also women.
The revolution deserves that!
Choose the ones you want.
Those whores or those who love the fine gentlemen.
Even the most expensive!
Even a soldier in petticoats like me.
You do not refuse him anything.
He need only ask.
Go to bed, Colomba.
- Enough.
- In bed? Come gringo.
Go ahead alone.
The Polack did not want you.
I said nothing.
Colomba, listen to me.
You do not want him?
Of course I do.
Why not?
He, at least, this is a hombre!
Are you happy?
Not quite.
Try like that.
With his best friend.
And his partner.
Gringo!
Where is he?
It stinks, right?
No.
It's good for the skin.
- It's true, you look great.
- What did you, idiot?
Go ahead.
Show us as good as the Mexicans.
Go!
Or I'll blow your brains out.
Sorry, gringo.
You know how women are.
I want it.
You exaggerate, Paco.
But if you want a fight,
I'll show you how a jealous idiot is thrashing.
Standing.
- It's unfair!
- Wait a minute.
Take that in the face!
He's crazy!
You won, Paco.
Arm.
Plays.
Fire!
Halt.
What?
Why do we stop?
I'm hot.
Santa Rosita is a big city.
There will be a garrison.
It's risky.
I know, but it's worth it.
This Thursday, Rosita is holy festival.
The bearded lady.
There will be a procession and you know how we are believers.
Really?
Now!
At first of these gentlemen.
I have four for the price of one.
Who is it?
Mayor with his family.
Let them hang.
No, wait.
She will cook and he shall wash our pants.
Outside.
General Paco Roman!
I demand justice.
Let me back my land.
- I want his head.
- What has he done?
Ask her.
It is the notary.
What have you done?
I did not do anything, listen.
That's the truth:
For three months, he asked me to share my house and my wife against his wife and his wretched farm because it is the revolution!
All right.
Kill him.
Not him, the other.
One who demands justice.
No, General.
It is rich, I'm poor!
Thank you, General.
You are the hope of Mexico.
My brother!
Your brother?
I do not know you.
I worked in the mines with you, my friend!
My friend!
I worked in the mines.
It's me, Pepote!
Pepote!
I knew a Pepote.
It was a revolutionary.
It was like my brother.
I sent it to buy guns.
It was long ago.
I do not even know you.
Remember, he was given money.
When he failed to return, it was believed dead.
Let me explain.
I'm still alive.
There, I recognize you.
You recognize him?
Thank you, my friend.
You have betrayed us.
You have spent our money.
You should not have.
Not really.
Do not waste a bullet.
Take a knife.
No, I saved your life!
I beg you, I did not want to hurt.
This is because of women.
It's true.
You saved my life.
I will not kill you.
But you will not go over to a brothel.
I swear.
I swear I will not do it again!
I have to be sure.
He should thank me to spare.
We can not rely to anyone.
Paco wants to see you.
He wants to see that too.
You are leaving us?
It not abandon his friends to their cause.
Nobody ever left Paco with deep pockets.
Your money stays here to serve the revolution.
You're a pig.
Maybe, I do not know.
You see that?
This is Mexico.
I did not know it was so great.
It's beautiful.
I want to work for Mexico.
I will take what is ours.
I want justice.
You will be judged.
Colomba.
"For eating when we were starving
"Drunk and when we were thirsty,
"For staying dry
"When we walked in the rain and so on,
"We condemn you ..."
At death, I presume?
I do not know... yet.
It depends my digestion.
We will have our wedding dinner.
Your fate will depend Colomba.
Do not be too optimistic.
I will marry him.
I am a General and a revolutionary.
I do not need a priest, or paperwork.
Take him.
Outside.
What a party!
Your sword...
Removes it.
It hurts me.
Fire!
What is it?
Firecrackers.
They celebrate our marriage.
Too bad...
- We must liberate the Poles.
- Forget it.
Paco, they attack!
All right, I'll release it.
They destroy everything.
The Polack they will raze the city!
These bastards are everywhere.
Help me.
They even have a plane.
I can hit him with a gun?
It's possible, yes.
But that's your problem.
We no longer team.
It may be wrong.
I will make your money with 10 000.
Too late!
No, come back!
Stop him!
Farewell, Paco!
Perfect, they are our thank you.
Bravo for once the plane.
I'll pick my two rascals.
You had promised me.
Forward!
If it is low enough...
Paco!
Colomba!
I'm stuck.
Blow up the lock.
Too late, they all died.
Listen to me.
Where are the Poles and Paco?
You can go to hell.
- So?
- Their band is decimated.
But Paco and Polack I have missed.
I have them.
Both of them.
I let you do as you intended.
I could have caught.
God knows where they are.
I want them both alive!
Double the reward and patrols.
As you wish.
Paco managed to get away.
It went from hero to clown
in six months.
Hello, Curly.
As we find ourselves.
One last time.
If you want to kill him, give him a chance.
He can defend himself.
A ball each.
Going back to back.
At the third sounding, you can take.
Go.
Have you seen? Subject property, eh?
Not bad.
I knew you'd end up.
I want...
Take your filthy paws, Paco.
Go, ahead.
We're going where?
Mexico.
You're worth $ 10 000.
I will recover what you robbed me.
Bastard.
Hurry up.
You've never been so clean.
You're sure of yourself?
I want my money.
He takes her to the 51st regiment.
It will be before them!
MEXICAN BORDER
The Poles, I understand.
But Paco?
Are you married?
We were, but a Mexican woman can not be fooled twice.
And if it was a trap?
I will stay with you, señor Garcia until your soldiers to have captured.
Then you pay me.
I see.
What do you sing?
A song of a compatriot.
You may know.
Chopin.
No... Expect.
There is no Chihuahua?
Hello, Commander.
I give you this rebel.
The famous Paco Roman.
Mexico There is now 3000 pesos.
In this regard,
I have something right here might interest you.
It's you!
This is you!
Prepare a cell.
Section, halt!
You have earned this, with my compliments.
You and I we could be celebrating tonight.
Both of them.
Expect at least he died, Colonel.
Be.
I do not inflict it.
As you see, you have more value your friend.
That's a start.
Pass them by arms.
Look where greed has led you.
I do not understand why She denounced you.
Women...
It's a revolutionary.
The revolution needs of these 60 000 pesos.
A guy like me, it's everywhere.
"On behalf of the republic,
I condemn the firing squad
"The so-called
Paco Roman and Sergei Kowalski
"For the following crimes:
"Theft, robbery,
"High treason and subversion,
"Homicide and murder
"Attack on train
"Vandalism and damaging public property,
"Crime and against the Mexican people.
"By these misdeeds,
"The guilty are sentenced to death under section 12-24
"Mexican penal code,
"The penalty is applicable immediately."
If she hopes to save you as well, it is mistaken.
Our salvation will come from heaven.
Arm.
Colomba, aims tanks.
Do not move!
You will not forget.
See you in San Pedro in two days.
- Tell them that Paco returned.
- I will.
Good luck!
Well?
There's your share.
I leave the Polack.
I join my people.
Paco.
It might be good, we both.
Teaming.
Novel and Kowalski, associate.
There is always a revolution start somewhere.
We can help each camp and to retire a few years.
Teaming up with you, it would be nice, but my revolution is here.
Farewell, friend.
They'll end up.
Perhaps.
But I have a dream to pursue.
Thou hast no dream?
It does not surprise me.
Now.
Good luck, Paco!
Continues to dream but keep your eyes open.

Subtitling: Vdm
Run, run!
Get it!
No, no. Let me go, please.
Hold him tight!
Hold him tight!
Hold the boy!
- Shit!
- Stop him!
Leave him alone.
Hey, stranger, get over here.
Don't you know it's dangerous to put your nose in other peoples' business?
It looked like fun, so I joined in.
Fun is just what they were having.
He was just invited to a party, and he's the guest of honor.
It'll be a family party.
He doesn't look anxious to go to your party.
That's exactly the reason why we invited him.
Why don't you come, too?
I like the tip of your trigger finger.
Isn't it a pity that every time you shoot a man, you're wasting gold?
Don't you save it for special occasions?
Listen, I've got a proposal for you.
On my ranch, I have living quarters for a man like you.
Come work for me.
Maybe. It depends on what work you need done.
Tie him up tight!
Don't be afraid that you'll hurt him.
- Pedro!
- Yes, boss.
Take one of my fastest horses and visit his father.
Tell him we want all the gold he found on the outlaws they hung...
...or we'll kill his son.
Also tell him I want all of it soon.
I'm anxious to close this deal.
Sure thing, boss. Right away.
Boys, there will be gold for all of you.
What are your thoughts, my friend?
I myself believe fathers have a strong love for their sons.
While we're all waiting, let's entertain our handsome, young guest.
Guarnito! Hurry! We're waiting to begin the party.
Why not sit down? Go on, sit there.
Make yourself at home, next to me.
Don't my boys have a good time here?
Why don't you join in the fun?
Come on. Drink up. Eat something.
Before you know it, you'll feel like one of us.
The place, the food, and the drink satisfy man's basic needs...
...and even more refined sensations, like crying, for instance.
This doesn't seem right.
You, holding the kid hostage.
I didn't know you were a model citizen.
Come on, you must have broken the law at some time in your life.
You handle a gun noticeably well, stranger.
Yeah. I have good reason to practice.
It is unlikely you got all that practice being an honest, law abiding man.
You'll enjoy being a member of my gang.
It should be quite obvious.
Mirami, my boys are hard workers...
...so I give them the best of everything.
See for yourself.
I taught them well, to enjoy good things.
If I have to pay the ransom for my son's life...
...you should help, too.
Why should l?
He's your son.
You pay with your share of the gold.
We're partners.
We share the same secret.
You pay your ransom, not me.
My share is not enough.
They'll kill him.
Don't you see they're determined to get all of the gold back?
Not my share. That stays with me.
The kid is not my responsibility.
I thought you were my partner.
I am your partner, Templer, but the boy is yours.
My God, you're scum.
Let me go or I'll shoot.
I'll make you pay.
Where are you? Can't you make up your mind quickly about the gold?
Take it easy, there.
Help yourself as much as you want.
Tell them they've got 5 minutes to make up their lousy minds.
- Did he agree?
- No.
He wouldn't give it to you?
No. I couldn't make him understand.
That was our chance to get our hands on all of it.
You mean, to sacrifice my son?
Can't you see it's only a bluff?
They're just trying to scare you--
I'm not going to take that risk.
The trouble is, you're weak as water.
You'd be a fool, telling them you've managed to get all the gold.
Deny it! Deny it!
Make them think you don't have it.
Here he comes.
It's no good. He says he doesn't have the gold.
He asked you to let the boy go.
I have a job for you, stranger.
Carry this kid's corpse back to his father.
Max! You know what to do.
Wait a minute.
I have an idea how he can be of use to us.
I'll get your gold.
You want to save the boy, don't you?
Guess I'm getting old.
All right.
You must first shoot that rope there...
...the one that ties him to the wall.
I know you're an excellent shot, so it should be easy for you.
But not so easy after drinking the rest of this whisky.
How about that?
I want to see if you're a good drinker.
He can get drunk.
Silence! Drinking is like playing.
You need concentration.
Now we'll see what kind of man you really are.
Pablo.
Stop.
I'll handle this.
Very smart.
You surprised me, friend.
Very smart.
But you should know better--
The boy is still tied up.
I'll give him to you anyway.
Cut that cord!
Hurry up! His life has been saved.
Cheer up, boy, if you want to please your father.
You should start praying for death...
...because now your life is worth less than the gold or the sand in the desert.
What's this? A funeral?
Get on with the party.
Who fired a gun?
- I don't know.
- It was a gunshot.
- Where did the shot come from?
- From the stable.
What happened? It was an accident.
He was playing with my gun.
He was looking for trouble.
I know how you must feel, stranger, after you did your best to save him.
He didn't want to be a man.
What do you mean?
A man must take on responsibility.
A man does what he must do, and accepts the consequences.
I'd say he died like a man.
My offer is still open to you, if you want to accept it.
Take him back to town, to his father, and get all the gold he's hidden.
If he doesn't cooperate, he'll have visitors.
I'll go, but I don't think it will do any good now.
I think it depends on you.
Pablo, saddle up that horse.
- You see anyone?
- Not yet.
Why don't they come?
What is it?
The stranger is bringing him in now.
What happened? How is he?
You better prepare yourself,
Templer. It doesn't look good.
Here they are.
Come on, take him.
Take him.
Help me with him.
Come on, move away from the table.
My poor boy, what did they do?
Are you mad?
He was disgusted of a father like you.
Hold him.
What's wrong with him?
He must be out of his mind...
...to have no respect for the feelings of a father for his son.
Kick him out of here, once and for all.
You'd better give up that gold, Templer.
Or they'll come and get you.
Are you going to just let him walk out of here?
No, not now.
There is too much wickedness.
They don't know you still have many gold bullets in your gun.
Son, you must have a lot of faith.
When you finish all your bullets, you must leave.
We have a common enemy.
You know who I mean.
You must be very careful of a man like Templer.
He has always threatened me with violence.
He's come into my house, where I live.
I didn't think any house in this town would welcome a guest.
Mine's different. If a stranger comes to my door, tired and hungry...
...he's always welcome.
Come on, stranger.
Why are you so generous?
Because I'm scared.
I've been threatened.
You can protect us.
I must have protection.
I'll pay you.
I do everything myself.
I don't have any servants.
I don't trust them. They steal and, there are too many nice things here.
Eat up. I'm sure you're hungry.
You'll get special treatment, if you'll just stay here.
You won't believe this, but I treat everybody specially.
An honest person can't sleep well in this town.
Are you afraid to live alone?
Yes, I am afraid...
...and I've been unfortunate.
I saw a woman up in that window.
You've already seen her?
She's my wife.
But she might as well not exist.
She's unbalanced.
The girl is insane.
I had to lock her up in her room, poor creature.
She wouldn't harm anyone.
She has the mind of a child.
If anything happened to me...
...Sorrow's men would come around.
What if Templer came here. A man with no religious principles or morals.
That's why the Lord struck down his son.
He lives with that woman openly and they're not married.
Everybody talks about that scandal.
Please say you'll protect us.
I want to go out.
She always does it.
She is always like this.
There is nothing I can do.
We better find that stranger and kill him before it gets dark.
And see about those 2 lndian men.
We have a fine reason to beat them.
Do whatever you want, but be sure he's as dead as a doornail tomorrow.
All right, boss, leave it to me.
It's a good bed...
But you don't want to fall asleep.
What's that?
Like this, don't turn it out.
I want you to rest, but stay awake.
I'm exhausted.
You can't stop me from sleeping.
I'm getting up early and hitting the road.
Good night.
I said, "Good night!"
I knew I'd find you in here.
I heard voices and somebody moving about.
Don't you recognize me?
Sure. I saw you in the window.
You didn't understand the signs
I was making to you.
What were you trying to tell me?
To get out of here. You're in danger.
You don't know what people are like here.
You're different from them.
You must not stay here.
I've got to save you.
Why do you think I'm in danger?
They are trying to murder you.
Life in this place is worth nothing.
Look at me.
What's your name?
Elizabeth.
Your husband says you are crazy.
He's evil.
He wants me to think I'm mad.
He nearly succeeded.
Why does he want to do that?
Because I fell in love with someone...
I've been locked up ever since.
Then you're not really mad.
I don't know.
What's the matter?
It's just...
There must be someone to love me.
He left your door unlocked?
Why did he do that?
Because he wants me to make sure you stay to defend his house.
Where's the gun?
Get out of here while there is time.
You haven't kissed me yet.
My love! My love!
What's going on?
It's Sorrow's men!
Arm yourself. Wait at the window.
But don't shoot!
Templer, open up.
We've got to do something.
Hide the gold.
- I know where to hide it.
- Where?
Templer, you can't stop us.
Do you hear?
We're not playing around.
We're coming in.
All right boys, break the door.
You take care of the horses...
...the rest of you get up there and break that door down.
Go for it!
Have you no respect for the dead?!
The saloon is closed.
We're in mourning here.
Listen to that, anybody will think it's true.
You know what to do.
Cover every corner of the house.
Templer, either you tell us where you hid it...
...or we're going to kill you.
You've searched this place from top to bottom.
You see, the gold ain't here.
It's been taken by that dirty rat,
Oldeman. You'll find it at his house.
If you're lying, watch out.
Quick! They're here. Save me.
Look, they're here!
No! Get away from the window.
Do something. That's why you're here-- to protect me.
Am I suppose to protect your house...
...your reputation or your wife?
Do you have anything of greater value?
There is light over there.
We'll have fun.
The house is this one.
Oldeman! Oldeman!
We're coming for the gold.
Here it is. Take it. Give it to them, before they harm you.
You're mad.
Leave her alone.
Come on, Oldeman, open up!
We don't like waiting.
Open!
- Somebody is there.
- Open the door.
Give us the gold!
Don't waste our time.
He's not him, Willy.
It's the gold!
It's the stranger! Kill him.
Get the horses and let's go.
Don't be afraid. It's all over.
She betrayed me... a servant in my house...
...no better than that.
Damn that half-breed.
I'll show them both...
...together they'll know who I am.
I know I can't help you.
You should try to forget it.
Don't be so sad. You know I love you.
I'm sure I can help.
I can't love you.
I've got to finish what I've started.
I know.
I've always known that would be your answer.
You'd leave me.
Where is my gun?
I have given you the power to walk upon serpents and scorpions...
...to withstand the light of adversary, whoever they may be.
If who so ever among you say,
"l shall be great", shall be small.
Who so ever shall say,
"l shall be first", shall be last.
For the son of God came among you, not to be served...
...but to serve you.
He gave his life so that you may live.
Amen.
What a day!
Give me a drink.
Rotten thief, now you know what it costs to double-cross me.
That will fix you and him at the same time.
He must have taken it while we were sleeping.
I want to know why.
I better go find him.
What are you going to do when the others come back to get the gold?
If you want, I'll stay.
No, they'll kill you.
Don't worry.
Go now, and some day come back for me.
If you don't, I shall die.
- Sure filled him full of holes.
- A good job.
Left his gun behind.
The chamber is empty.
I know this gun. I'm sure I do.
Hey! Wait a minute.
This bullet is solid gold.
It's the stranger! He murdered Templer.
Go and get him.
What are you waiting for?
Lori. Where the devil is Lori?
I haven't seen her.
She's a bad woman.
I'm sure she's got something to do with this.
Better get going.
Take your guns.
Yes, let's go. Come on!
Hey, mister. Hey, you!
Come here.
Listen, I'm terrified.
I want you to help me.
They're going to kill me.
Oldeman has killed Templer.
It was awful.
I managed to get away. I saw him do it.
I saw him kill Templer.
Where did he do it?
In the saloon.
We just came from the funeral.
Now he wants to kill me.
I'm in danger because I saw him do it.
I don't stand a chance in hell against Oldeman.
He's a highly respected citizen.
He can kill me and make it look perfectly legal.
Would you like to be rich?
What do you mean by that?
Exactly what do you want me to do?
I know where he hid all of Templer's gold.
If you help me get it, we'll split it.
Where is it?
At the cemetery. In Evan's coffin.
I don't have the courage to get it myself...
...but there is enough gold down there to do things that--
Listen here. If anyone tries to open that boy's coffin...
...I'll make sure he's shot.
Haven't you done enough?
That gold belongs to Evan.
But we need it to leave this place.
We've got to get out of here before they kill us.
Your life is in danger as well as mine.
What do you think of this baby?
All right, are you ready? Let's go.
Come on, hurry up!
Now we'll see some action.
You heard him. Get going.
If you want to sleep in your beds, then find those two.
Make sure they won't do any more harm in our town.
Let's get rid of him.
Search everywhere.
Let's stay together.
Look everywhere.
Hey, his friends are here.
Oh, those lndians...they always hang around with him.
There they are!
Those dirty lndians!
They'll know where he is.
They always do.
Let's make them talk.
Let me get my hands on them.
Kill him.
Don't shoot him. It's a sin.
I always wanted the scalp.
A perfect job!
A perfect hairdresser.
Well done.
It was so easy.
They're coming to get you.
You must hide.
How many of them are there?
The whole town!
Let's go!
Hold it, stranger.
You can't get away this time.
Come on, Willy, stop.
This man is ours.
Now you'll have to answer to
Mr. Sorrow.
Where is he? What have you done?
Your precious lover?
Sorrow's man took him away and tortured him to death.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I'll deal with you later.
Come here.
You'll never get out of here alive.
Hold it. We don't want him unconscious.
You're very stupid...
...when you could have taken advantage of my offer...
...to become one of my boys.
We could be friends, but you prefer to go your own way, don't you?
You are going to tell me where that gold is.
You made a mistake.
An elementary mistake.
Now, you're gonna have to pay.
Mr. Sorrow doesn't like to be cheated.
You'll tell me even if
I cut your tongue out.
Carlos, go and prepare our persuasive little pets.
We'll have to get going, but you won't be lonely.
I'm going to make sure you have nice company.
Do you like the company of snakes or blood-sucking vampire bats?
Rats can also be good company.
You won't be lonely.
Carlos, let's wish him a good night.
Come on.
It's useless, Sorrow.
You can't scare me.
You don't know me.
We'll see. We'll see.
I've made stronger men than you tell me everything.
You'll change your ideas soon.
Come on, Carlos.
Sleep easy.
Willie, Canada, Carlos.
Come on, all of you.
We can get going!
Our prisoner has been persuaded to talk.
We know where the gold has been hidden.
Search everywhere.
Go now. Go!
The cemetery...the cemetery.
Having a good time with your friends?
Interesting, isn't it?
It's better than any party.
The cemetery...
If everything goes as planned, they should be back before dawn.
Don't you want a drink?
How did you get here?
You don't believe that this is just for playing music?
That's right, corporal.
A drink! A drink!
All right, you dirty, old drunk!
It's a pity you don't understand what my boys mean to me.
They make me so happy in their black uniforms.
Drink, you feathered sponge.
You'll like it.
Damn it. There's no gold in there.
We've been tricked.
It must have been here.
We've got to find that gold!
Go on. What are you waiting for?
Open every grave. Get going.
Dig! Dig!
Dig, damn it.
We've got to find that gold.
Dig! We'll find that gold if we have to tear up every grave in this cemetery.
Give me the explosives.
Take as much as you can.
Come on, let's go.
Here, take this.
Come on, let's go.
Here they come. Go, go.
It's the Boss's horse. Get him.
Stop him.
Go the other way.
Get him.
Something's wrong.
Get him.
I finally got him.
Damn you.
What have you done, maniac?
It's burning. It's the upper floor.
Everything is burning.
How did it happen?
I hope no one is inside.
You'd better come out quick.
Move yourself, come on.
We must pray. Can any of you get down on their knees and pray?
I've never seen a fire like this.
What a shame.
It was a beautiful place.
He was proud of it, wasn't he?
There's no point in letting a house burn down like this.
I won't give you 2 bits for it.
Did you hear the screams?
You can't get close.
Fortunately it's isolated.
Or the whole town could've burnt down.
Let's get out of here.
It's too dangerous.
It can collapse any moment.
Look at me!
[GOAT BLEATING]
A couple of saddle tramps just rode in.
Looks like they're stopping at the Lost Love.
But they're not going in.
CLERK:
Yes, sir, I know, I know.
MAN: You people are thieves.
Did you know that?
I've been paying interest so long,
I plumb forgot what the capital is.
CLERK: Nobody forced you to come in...
MAN: Force?
Did you hear that? "Force"?
Me with a wife, a mule, two Leghorn roosters looking for a hen...
...and six young ones to feed, and all this fool can say is "force"?
- It'll be a cold day in...
DEE: Never mind the hard stuff.
We'll just take the paper.
Come on, come on, give me your gun.
This is force, mister.
[HORSE WHINNYING]
Get out!
[GASPS]
HAWKINS:
Cort!
ROSCOE:
Drop it!
Pick it up. Don't let me stop you.
Come out! Drop them!
Don't look too good, does it, Bishop?
Roscoe, go open up the cells. Cort...
...you and Hawkins help me cover them.
If one of them even spits, blow his head off.
JOE: I need a doctor.
- You ain't hurt. Move!
They shot Nathan Stoner and killed one of my clerks.
[MURMURING]
HAWKINS:
Get your hands up.
John, get Doc Curtis over here right away.
JOHNSON: Bishop, you and one other in that first cell on the right.
- In there, old man.
JOE: Pa.
I figured you'd hit me a turn one of these days, Bishop.
When they write about you...
...they'll call Val Verde your end of the line.
Well, I've never seen anything so bad that a little money or talk can't settle.
You can talk till you're blue in the face if you've a mind to.
I'm a different kind of sheriff than you've been used to.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Means you can't beg, borrow, steal...
...buy, break or pray your way out of my jail.
CARTER:
July!
Nathan Stoner just died.
Roscoe, you men search them and take their gun belts.
All right, let me have them.
[FIDDLE PLAYING]
[YELLING INDISTINCTLY]
[SHOUTING]
MACE: Give me a Rosebud, will you?
BARTENDER: Coming up.
Say, have you heard about any jobs to be had around San Anton?
No, and a hundred others have asked me the same thing since sundown.
Uh-huh. Who do I see about getting a cot tonight?
- Me, if you got 50 cents.
- Fifty?
The sign over there says
25 cents for a cot.
That's when things are slow.
50 cents, take what you can find.
- It's kind of steep.
- No laughing, no talking...
...no singing, no drinking and no snoring and no spitting.
Right through that door, and don't step on anyone.
I wanna bed down the horse.
Is there a livery handy?
Across the street.
He charges 60 cents.
Well, that seems fair enough.
[SNORING]
Seems to me like you could stand a good scrubbing yourself.
Water washes away a man's protection...
...lets miseries into his body, and I'm too old to take chances.
If what you're saying's true, you're the best-protected man in town.
Well, I ain't sick, never been sick and don't intend to be sick. Next!
Now, if you're gonna shave,
I'll fill a pan...
...but if you ain't, I won't.
- Fill the pan.
BARBER: They tell me you're a hangman.
GRIMES: They told you right, friend.
Left Oklahoma City three weeks ago and headed for Val Verde, Texas.
This'll be one of the biggest jobs
I've had in years:
The Bishop gang.
Judge found them guilty as sin.
Sentenced them to hang high as a Georgia pine.
Good for the state of Texas too when they're out of the way.
- How many did they catch?
GRIMES: They killed one, caught five.
Ex-Quantrill men, mostly.
Leastways, Bishop is.
Be the first Texans I ever hung.
I plan to enjoy it.
Hey, bring my clothes over here, will you?
- Ain't you gonna shave?
- No.
MAN:
What in the world...?
Can't make up their mind.
I can't stand it...
...I've gotta keep this place spick-and-span.
A fella can't even make up his mind...
[SINGING]
[HORSE APPROACHING]
MACE: Afternoon.
- Howdy.
Get down and set a spell, friend.
Got more fish here if you're hungry.
Mighty generous of you.
I'm a generous man. Believe in it.
Make yourself at home.
Coffee there. Sweet biscuits there.
MACE: Hey, you got all the comforts.
- Yes, sir, friend. I enjoy life.
My soul's on fire with the spirit of it, if you know what I mean.
That's fine.
Well, it looks to me like you must be a rope drummer.
GRIMES:
Oh.
No, just the tools of my profession.
I'm a hangman.
A hangman? Well, I declare.
On my way to hang the Bishop gang down in Val Verde.
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
Well, they finally got that bunch, huh?
Caught, jailed, tried and gonna hang.
Well, I sure am happy to come across you, Mr...
Grimes. Ossie Grimes, of the Oklahoma Grimes.
Mr. Grimes, yes, sir.
Yeah, I sure am happy I've run across...
You know, I've always been sort of curious about your job.
Well, there's a lot more to it than most folks think.
There's nothing worse than a sloppy hanging.
Back in Oklahoma, I once watched them hang a fella five times before it took.
Five times? Five?
Just exactly what do you have to know, Mr. Grimes...
...in order to make a good, clean, professional job of it?
Well, just about everything.
You have to know how tall your subject is, how much he weighs...
...his neck size and how he feels about it all.
- Then you have to be certain...
- Excuse me.
You mean to say you have to know...
...how the fellow you're gonna hang feels about it?
Oh, yes, sir.
A scared man who's crying and praying and shaking...
...and moving around is harder to send to his maker...
...than one who's decided to just stand there and take it.
Uh-huh.
Why, I had a subject last year...
...took me an hour just to get him up off his knees.
- Is that a fact?
- That's a fact.
You can't hang a subject when he's on his knees.
It just don't look right.
And I'll tell you one more thing.
When you select a rope...
- What are you looking at?
- You tell me.
- Hey, Robbie.
ROBBIE: What?
I got a young boy here who's worried about his future.
Yeah. I reckon he is at that too.
I hope to God that they don't dump himself and myself in the same hole.
I have enough explaining to do up there without having him along.
Fine pair of lookouts, you and your pop.
Let me tell you something, Bishop...
...I've been on the wrong side of the law for over 40 years...
...and I ain't been in jail long enough to soften up a chaw of tobacco.
I ride out with you, and here I am watching them build my own gallows.
Well, everybody else has had their say.
What about you?
It don't look too good, does it?
Ossie Grimes is the name, sheriff.
Down from Oklahoma to prove again that the sins of the fathers...
...are visited on the sons.
That's true in Texas just like any place.
The Southwest will be a better place when I'm finished.
Well, I'm July Johnson, Mr. Grimes.
I'm the one that sent for you.
This here is my deputy,
Roscoe Bookbinder.
- Glad to know you.
- Howdy.
Known him all his life.
Born in a hogan north of El Paso.
- A fine boy.
- Fine, fine.
Well, first off, sheriff, I'd like to see the subjects, if you don't mind.
- The what?
- What? The... The subjects.
- The prisoners?
- In my profession, they're subjects.
In my jail, they're nothing.
Follow me.
Here they are, Mr. Grimes, all ready for you.
MACE:
Well, I'd have to say now...
I wonder if you fellas would move forward a little...
...to the bars.
Would you come forward?
All right, do what the man says.
Ah...
Well, sheriff, seems like to me you got four good necks here...
...that ought to snap pretty good.
I'm just not quite sure about this one.
How much do you weigh, son?
Uh...
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Well, maybe it'll be all right.
I always like to do a nice clean job.
Usually when I have a lightweight...
...I strap on a 50-pound bag of sand, get some weight on him...
...and then that neck:
[MAKES SNAPPING SOUND]
Just like that.
How do you feel about it all, son?
- You're crazy.
- Now, you're not gonna be...
...praying and crying and all that stuff?
You'll just hold up the procedure.
Won't make it any easier for me or you.
- This one Bishop, sheriff?
JOHNSON: Yeah, that's him.
- You rode with Quantrill, did you?
- All the way.
And at Lawrence, Kansas?
- You were in on that?
- I was there.
You must have made your mother mighty proud.
DEE:
Hangman.
I never harmed a woman or a child.
We're planning on high noon tomorrow, if that suits you.
That'll be fine.
You know, sheriff, when a man in my profession...
...gets a chance to work with equipment like that, it just makes him proud.
- Uh-huh.
- You're expecting a big crowd, I imagine?
It's a free country.
Folks got a right to watch a hanging.
Well, then I'd like to advise you about two things, sheriff.
I've found out from bitter experience that when folks come for a hanging...
...all guns should be confiscated until after...
...and all saloons should be closed.
- Well, I'll see what I can do.
- Good.
These men deserve to hang...
...but they don't deserve to hang sober while drunks stand around watching.
That man sure...
...Ioves his work.
- I'll bed your horses, Mr. Grimes.
- Fine.
These ropes stay with me.
Her name's Maria Stoner, hangman.
One of the men you're gonna send away tomorrow killed her husband.
Have that sorrel ready for me in the morning, huh?
And this is the last one, Mrs. Stoner.
Well, the unfortunate demise of your husband...
...has left you quite a sizable estate.
You mean the death of my husband has made me...
...the wealthiest woman in this county.
Well, that's quite a jump for a little...
...girl from south of the border.
I have to be going.
Mrs. Stoner, it might be wise if we discussed...
...the disposition of your ranch.
- Disposition?
Yes. Several weeks ago
I had a discussion...
...with Nathan about a possible sale.
I made him an offer.
- He seemed quite agreeable.
- The ranch is not for sale.
- You don't expect to live out there...
- I intend to keep it.
But you don't intend to run it.
No woman in her right mind would attempt to operate...
...a 150,000-acre spread.
Whether or not I succeed in operating it, Mr. Carter...
...is not your concern.
I can take care of myself.
I think you overestimate your ability,
Mrs. Stoner.
Perhaps I do.
Good day, Mr. Carter.
Mr. Carter, I was a whore at 13...
...and my family of 12 never went hungry.
When you figure we'll make our play, Dee?
- Not tonight.
- We don't do something tonight...
...we're gonna hang tomorrow.
- You got any ideas?
- No, but you should.
- Well, I do, old man, so shut up.
Hey, laddie, tell me:
What miracle are you going to perform when the sun comes up, huh?
[DOOR OPENS]
All right. Step up and get it.
Same damn chili and beans.
Did you ever hear of beefsteak?
Beefsteak, my ass.
Hell, pork chops up
15 cents a pound...
...and the man's talking about he wants beefsteak.
MACE: Nice night, isn't it, Mrs. Stoner?
Oh, I'm sorry.
How do you know my name?
I get the idea just about everybody around here knows your name.
I'm very pleased to meet you.
I'm... I apologize for the intrusion.
I'm being a little forward, and l...
Oh, please. Don't go.
- You are the hangman, aren't you?
- Well, I'm...
[EX CITED CHATTER]
Hear them in there?
Getting all liquored up for the big day tomorrow.
Celebration over the death of fellow human beings.
That is a strange thought for a hangman.
- Do you have a family?
- A brother. He's all that's left.
It was the war, Mrs. Stoner.
The war took our family. Almost took me, but I'm a pretty fast runner.
Good night.
MARIA: Good night.
- I didn't know him...
...but I'm sorry about your husband,
Mrs. Stoner.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Gonna be a big day tomorrow, Roscoe.
Better get some sleep.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
JOHNSON:
Mrs. Stoner.
- Maria.
- Yes.
JOHNSON: Do you mind if I come in for a minute?
MARIA: Well, I would prefer you didn't...
- I won't take but a minute, ma'am.
What is it, sheriff?
My friends call me July, ma'am.
I wish you were one.
I'll tell you what, ma'am.
I'll be your friend, and you just don't bother about being mine.
The reason I come up here tonight was to see if there was anything...
...I could do for you. Anything at all.
- No. No, there's nothing.
I'm going home tomorrow.
Oh.
I see.
Well, it still goes.
Anytime.
MARIA:
July.
Thank you.
- Morning.
- Good morning.
MACE:
Well, let's see you trip her.
[THUDDING]
They got it working fine, hangman.
Now it's up to you.
A man that's been hung by
Ossie Grimes stays hung.
Bishop, it appears to me
I have misjudged you.
The town's filling up, and you ain't even made a move.
Well, it appears to me I misjudged you too, Pop. You're scared.
It's my boy I'm thinking of.
He ain't even full-growed yet.
I'm scared, Dee, and I ain't ashamed of it.
Babe, when the time comes...
...whatever we have to do, we'd better be quick about it.
You too, Robbie.
When we have to move, move.
Right, laddie.
BARTENDER: I'm sorry.
Come back after. Yeah? Well...
Hey, check your guns in over there.
Sorry, closed till after the hanging.
Hey, it's that way.
ROSCOE: Put the rifles over there, gentlemen. Put your rifles in that pack.
MAN:
I'll tell you what, don't lose my gun.
We asked you not to wear them to town in the first place.
The holster too.
You'll get it back in a little while.
Hyah!
Hyah!
Giddap!
It's about that time, ain't it?
Yeah, just about. Run them out.
JOHNSON:
All right. Clear a path down there.
So hold it right there.
All right. Come up the steps one at a time. You first, Bishop.
Move down the line and then turn around.
- Aren't you gonna tie their hands?
- First things first, sheriff.
Be a long time before the likes of them ride into Val Verde again.
Hold it!
I'm a fair man, sheriff.
Now, you be good, and I won't kill you.
Tell your deputy to drop it. Tell him!
All right, do it, Roscoe.
- Move it.
- I knew you'd do it, laddie.
Who you gonna hang now?
Hold it right there.
- All right, break the crowd up.
- Get back there.
Come on.
Come on, get back there.
- Get back!
DEE: All right. Move it.
DEE:
Bring that wagon up here.
ROBBIE:
Come on. Get out of it. Goddang!
Keep them covered. Take what you need and get rid of the rest of their guns.
- Do you think you'll get far, Bishop?
- Not as far as you were gonna send me.
[GUNSHOTS]
[TALKING INDISTINCTLY]
ROBBIE:
Let's go!
Let's get the hell out of here!
DEE:
Giddap! Hyah!
Let's go, men!
They're headed southwest.
JOHNSON:
All right, hurry up with the wagon!
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
Get your guns! Don't worry about getting your own gun. Just get a gun!
Get back there!
You know what they did, so if you're going with me, be ready.
When we come on them, shoot to kill.
Hyah!
Hasn't been one of your good days, has it?
Well, I wouldn't exactly say that.
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
Yes, I'd appreciate it very much if you'd fill these up with money.
But you're the hangman...
No. Now, you see, you're wrong about that too.
And I don't really feel I have time to explain it all to you...
...so just do as I say, and you'll stay healthy...
...and everything will be all right.
Just fill them up.
Get in there.
That's it.
It's a tough world, isn't it?
We ain't got no time.
You ain't planning to waste none of it around here, are you?
Well, if you wanna cross that border with no grub, go ahead.
And take the kid with you.
[GUNSHOT]
[MARIA SCREAMS]
Hurry up. Take as much as you can.
You didn't have to do this.
I didn't do it, he did it. And if he hadn't done it, I'd have done it.
Dee.
Robbie, take her to cover.
Leave me alone.
[SCREAMING]
Now.
[GUNSHOTS]
[GUN CLICKING]
They got that Stoner woman!
I almost shot her.
Yeah, I know.
Pass the word, Roscoe.
God help the man that hurts her.
Right.
How does a man become an animal like you?
Don't shoot the Stoner woman.
Don't shoot the Stoner woman.
You gonna let her stop you?
You can't ask...
I haven't asked anything, Carter!
[GUNSHOTS FROM ABOVE]
Who in the hell's that?
- Johnson, they're getting away!
- Don't you think I know that?!
Don't you, by damn, think I know that?!
Roscoe!
Go track them as far the border.
Wait for me there. I'll be along.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
I want 10 volunteers.
Ten good horses, 10 good guns.
No clerks, no storekeepers.
We'll outfit at the Stoner ranch. The rest of you, take care of the wounded...
...and go on back to town.
- You going across the border?
- That's right!
After them or after her?
MAN:
Hey, sheriff! He robbed the bank!
CARTER: Who did?
- The hangman.
Mrs. Stoner, you're gonna be with us until we don't need you no longer.
Then you can go on home.
Hmm?
ROBBIE: Have you no plan, laddie?
- My plan is to stay away from a rope.
[LAUGHING]
That's a dandy one, that is.
Indeed it is.
She sure is pretty.
She's not pretty, she's beautiful.
Beautiful as something real fine.
Something you can't never have, no matter how bad you want it.
Looks to me like we got her.
- You ain't got nothing, kid. Forget it.
- I don't mean nothing.
That's right. You don't mean nothing.
Shh. Listen.
[HORSE APPROACHING]
Dee, you gone plumb loco?
Get down, Mace. Help yourself.
It ain't much.
It's just like a woman I once had...
...back in Kentucky: Warm and free.
Why, it's the hangman.
- Hey, what's he doing here?
- That ain't no hangman, Pop.
- That's nobody but my brother.
POP: Your brother?
DEE:
Mace, this is Pop Chaney.
That's his young fine son back there who's studying for the ministry.
Babe Jenkins.
- Robbie O'Hare.
ROBBIE: Hi.
DEE:
Mrs. Stoner.
You all right, Mrs. Stoner?
- Hey, you!
- Pop.
Apologize for what happened to you,
Mrs. Stoner.
You can go home in the morning.
Mrs. Stoner goes home when I say she goes home...
...and she ain't going home in the morning, Mace.
When I ain't got no blood-in-the-eye posse running up my backside...
...then she can do what she wants.
Until then, she stays.
So you never harmed a woman or a child, huh?
She's harmed? She ain't harmed.
You sure put her in a good position.
I'd like to have my gun back, Dee.
Robbie.
Still picking up after your brother.
Mama would be proud of that.
Seen Mama lately?
Not since the funeral.
Mama's dead?
I buried her six weeks to the day after Appomattox.
It was raining.
- She didn't suffer?
- Only in her mind.
- Because of me, you mean.
- You're the one who said that.
I killed her. That's what you mean.
You never did her any good, Dee.
That's what I mean.
The day she found you joined Quantrill...
...she started going downhill for the last time.
And when you fellows burnt
Lawrence, Kansas...
...after that, she never spoke another word. She just...
...sat by the fire...
...and didn't say anything.
Hey, Robbie. Here's a mama for you.
One boy goes with Quantrill, the other goes with Sherman.
One helps burn down a town, the other helps burn down a state.
The one that burned the town is the one that done in his mama.
Sherman was war, Dee.
Quantrill was meanness.
Well, what about this big sheriff and his bunch?
Think he's gonna cross the border?
A South Texas sheriff who once rode with Nathan Bedford Forrest.
A man who was made a fool of in his own town.
He'll cross it.
If there's something you know that we don't...
...I think you'd better tell us what it is. You're with us.
Whatever happens to us happens to you.
Maybe even more so.
The country we have been through between here and the Rio Grande...
...is patrolled by the federales.
From here to south is the territorio bandolero.
Well, what's that,
"territorio bandolero"?
Bandit country.
They kill every gringo they can find.
- You don't look too worried.
- I am not a gringo.
Well, there's a town called
Sabinas just south of here.
- It is a three-day ride.
- We'll be safe there.
The sheriff won't follow us that deep in.
He will follow.
What makes you so certain?
Because you have something he has wanted for a long time.
- What's that?
- Me.
Four, maybe five hours.
This is the first time I have been in my country since I left.
I always knew
I would come back again...
...but not quite this way.
How'd you come to marry your husband, Mrs. Stoner?
He bought me, Mr. Bishop.
He found me in the backroom of a cantina.
He liked me, and he bought me.
He gave my father five cows and a gun.
It made my father the richest man in our village.
Did you ever come to love him?
No.
But he was kind to me.
He was considerate.
And he took me from something
I never felt a part of.
He gave me a home.
Now here I am.
Well, from the looks of you, Mrs. Stoner, you have a long way yet to go.
- Want some coffee?
- No.
Excuse me.
Mace, if you're ever alone with Pop and his little boy...
...don't you turn your back on them.
- I know.
I can't decide which of us they hate the most.
- Oh, it's you.
- I think you're right.
Mace, I ain't had a chance to tell you, but it sure is real good to see you again.
And sometimes I think back to how it used to be with you and me.
- You remember when...?
- Dee, that was yesterday.
Now, let's talk about today.
All right. What about today?
Now, why do you ride with men like these?
Oh, I don't know. I just got used to it,
I guess, through the years.
You know, you begin to go one way and keep on going that way...
...pretty soon, there's no other way.
You really believe that?
No, I guess not.
BABE: You sure are pretty.
- Pretty.
A pretty woman ain't good for nothing but smelling sweet...
...and laying around the house.
Just so pretty.
Is it after a little kiss you are, Babe?
Oh, he's a great kisser, ma'am.
He's the best damn lady-kisser in the whole of Texas.
[MEN LAUGHING]
Leave the woman alone.
Oh...
Hell, he wouldn't harm a hair on her head, laddie.
She's a lady. Treat her like one.
It's time you got some sleep.
How far are we going, July?
I mean, are we just gonna...
...keep following them till we come up on them...
...or what?
No matter how far they go?
That's right.
Suppose they just keep going on forever?
Then we'll just keep going on forever.
What if we lose them?
There's only a couple of places they could be headed.
There's only a couple of places with water.
I won't lose them.
I'll find them, or I'll find their bones, but I won't lose them.
HAWKINS:
Hold up, July!
This don't make sense no more, July.
- What don't make sense, Hawkins?
- We've come too far already.
Ain't no telling where we'll end up, dead most likely, if we keep going.
You wanna turn back?
Wanting ain't part of it.
I'm turning back.
Anybody going with me?
Ain't nobody coming with me?
Maybe he's right, Johnson.
It don't make no sense no more.
I mean, it just don't make sense.
Goodbye, Ross, Hawkins.
HAWKINS:
You coming with us?
It's not the Bishop gang he's after now, it's the Stoner woman.
Just like Carter said.
Hey! Wait up there! Wait for me!
What are you hurrying so for? That sheriff can't go any faster than we can.
Are you giving out, Pop?
Oh, it's just that I don't see no sense in hurrying, that's all.
So the old bastardo is not as tough as he smells.
How can two brothers be so different?
Who, Mace? Oh, he believes in the goodness of his fellow man.
He's never seen it, but he believes in it.
I don't believe in it.
- What do you believe in?
- I believe in myself.
You fool nobody but yourself.
And I don't believe you even do that.
You really think you had a hard life, don't you, Dee?
- You don't understand.
- No?
What would you know about having to scrape for a living?
I could tell you a lot about the hard life...
...but you'd have to live it to understand it.
Yes, I believe that.
CORT:
Johnson!
We ain't going no further. This is it.
We're turning back.
- All of you?
- All of us.
- You just ain't gonna find them.
- I'll find them.
Do you know how big this country is?
Why, it just swallowed them up.
- For all we know, they...
- Now, who's missing?
We came into that pass with 10 men.
I count eight of us now.
Clyde Anderson ain't with us, July.
Wade Phillips is missing too.
July.
All right, Cort, you and the men can ride back home if you want to.
Course, that's the only way.
Unless you wanna ride
50 miles around.
All right, then.
You stay here till we get back.
Stay where you are.
You wouldn't recognize him anyway.
I reckon the other one's around here somewhere.
- The Indians, July?
- No, bandits.
If you wanna ride for home, you leave right now from here.
I'll understand. I'll tell the others
I sent you home to report.
I'll stay with you, July.
Now, you don't have to.
I just want you to know that.
No, I'll stick.
Then if anybody ever says to me:
"Did you ride all over Mexico with July Johnson?"
I can say to him, "Yep...
...I rode all over Mexico with July Johnson."
You're a good boy. I always said it.
You stop picking your nose, boy.
It ain't mannerly.
- You had no call to do that.
- Now, none of your lip.
You're raising up your boy to be a good Christian, I see.
POP: I'm learning him what my pa learned me.
The Almighty rest his damn bones.
There's three things a man ought never do:
Spit in church, scratch himself in front of his ma...
...and pick his nose. Yes, sir.
That's what my pa learned me, and it stood me in good stead.
I don't imagine your pa ever mentioned...
...shooting people and burning houses and things like that.
I'm talking about mannerly things,
Mr. Bishop.
I ain't talking about making a living.
Oh.
What the hell, Bishop?
You were leaning on my saddle,
Mr. Chaney.
You lean on your own saddle.
Babe, get out there and see if anything's moving.
Dee.
- Something wrong?
- Things have been wrong a long time.
Don't you think it's about time we have a talk?
- Well, I'll tell you the truth...
- Yeah, liars always start that way.
No, Mace, I'll tell you the truth.
I can't remember a single instance where talking's ever...
...gotten me anyplace.
But go ahead. Tell me what you wanna talk about, maybe I'll join you.
All right. I wanna talk about us having a place of our own.
Our own ranch.
How's that sound to you?
Not worth a rooster without a hen.
How come? Seems to me
I can remember back to a time...
...you wanted a place of your own awful bad.
That was before the war.
We were younger then.
Well, not that much younger.
Young enough to think about a good woman.
You know how long it's been since
I been with a woman I could respect?
I may not be good, but I sure do know what good's supposed to be.
We were young enough back in those days to think about children.
You're not saying you're too old to be a father?
I'm just saying you reach a time when all them things are lost to you.
They're not lost to you, Dee.
They're not lost.
You may have thrown some of them away. They're not lost to you.
DEE:
Get up, Babe.
[SCREAMS]
Get up!
Honest, Dee, I wasn't gonna do nothing but kiss her.
Well, what's wrong with a little old kiss?
Ain't nothing wrong with a little old kiss, Dee.
A little old kiss never hurt nobody.
From now on, you and me are gonna be close together whether you like it or not.
I can't stand the thought of something like him...
...with his hands on something like you.
I thought he was your friend.
He is, but that don't make him any less disgusting.
Matter of fact, all my friends are disgusting.
You take Pop, for instance.
He was due to be shot the day he was born.
And that heart of his is nothing but a festering sore.
His kid, he's something, ain't he?
If you feel that way about them, why are you with them?
I know where they stand.
I've never known where respectable people stood.
Maybe they don't know themselves.
You say the sheriff's always wanted you?
He is a good man.
I...
I reckon he's got you all to himself now.
He's a good man, but I feel nothing for him.
[CHUCKLES]
Why do you laugh?
I was just thinking. We'd make a perfect pair, you and me.
I'm broke, without a woman...
...and you're rich and without a man.
- This ain't Sabinas, is it, laddie?
- Is this what you brung us to?
DEE: This is the town.
MACE: Why, it's a ghost.
DEE: Looks that way, Mace.
Sure does look that way.
MACE: A lot of horses through here lately, Dee.
Maybe not more than a day or so.
Mostly barefoot.
This is your country. What do you think happened to these people?
Bandoleros.
They demand too much of the people.
When they grow tired of being raided, they leave.
As they have done here.
You mean to say a whole town just packs up and leaves...
...and never comes back?
Well, sometimes they go to a larger town...
...where they can be protected by the soldiers of Benito Juarez.
Mace, we'll put up over in that cantina.
That's the best place around.
What do you plan on doing now, Dee?
Well, I'll just rest up here a few days...
...ride on to Hidalgo for supplies and push on to Matamoros.
I got friends in Matamoros.
Well, what about Mrs. Stoner?
Mace, you think we could make a go of it in Montana?
Dee, there's a town up there called Missoula.
- Prettiest place you ever saw.
- What about the Indians?
And the Rockies, they're snowcapped, and the slopes are forested...
...and there are lots of lakes and...
- What about the Indians?
And there's deer in Montana, Dee.
And antelope and elk...
- Mace, what about the Indians?
...and black bear and...
What Indians?
Ain't there no Indians in Montana?
Well, a few.
Ain't there Northern Cheyenne in Montana?
The Northern...
Well, the Northern Cheyenne...
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- The Crow and the Sioux?
- Well, they're around.
- What else, Mace?
- Listen, Dee...
- What else?
Well, the Blackfeet...
...and Chippewa.
- Some Cree?
Yes. Yes, there are Cree in Montana.
And the Shoshone and the Kootenai and the Stoney.
Just what are you trying to say?
I'm trying to say there's a lot of goddamn Indians in Montana, Mace.
- You're impossible to talk to.
- Wait a minute.
Will you sit down, Mace?
I'm tired, Mace. Bone-tired.
I can't even remember what it feels like to get up in the morning...
...feeling rested and clean, having a good breakfast.
I can't remember what it feels like...
...to slip down in between some cool, clean sheets.
Mace, we'll need money.
Have you thought about that?
I think I know where I can get my hands on some.
Your brother won't never make it.
There's only one way for him...
...for me, for any of us.
MACE:
Well, what way is that, Mr. Chaney?
This way. The way we know.
The way we growed.
Well, now, that may be so for you, but for my brother, it's different.
I don't care if he is your brother.
The son of a bitch...
Now...
...before you apologize, I'm gonna tell you something, Mr. Chaney.
My brother and I are the sons of an honest dirt farmer.
A man who slaved all his life from sunup to sundown...
...and never took time except to deliver his children...
...and go to meeting on Sunday.
A man who died of old age at 45...
...and who never saw more than
$ 10 at one time in his whole life.
We're the sons of a woman that married him for his goodness...
...because she was good!
And now you can apologize for slandering my family, Mr. Chaney.
I'll blow your head off.
You ain't no killer.
You ain't got the stomach for it.
Apologize!
I'm sorry, Mr. Bishop.
I didn't mean no harm.
I'm going outside, Dee.
I'd appreciate it if you see
I don't get shot in the back.
- July?
- Mmm?
What if she won't have you?
Why shouldn't she have me?
Well, I don't know.
It's just, she might not want you.
You trying to tell me something, Roscoe?
No, July, it's just...
Well, because you want her doesn't mean that...
...she's gotta want you right back.
Does it?
I don't wanna talk about it.
- Why?
- What?
- Why don't you wanna talk about it?
- Roscoe, I just don't.
Now, Roscoe, you been a good boy all of these years.
Now, don't spoil it.
Who's standing guard?
Jeeters.
Well, I reckon I'll go spell him.
MACE: Well, there's another one'll never make it to Matamoros.
DEE: How many does that make?
- Three.
Looks to me like we'll be mostly walking when we leave.
You two have gotten pretty close, haven't you?
- Nothing's been said.
- Well, nothing has to be said.
It's just a feeling, Mace.
You know, it's just a feeling, but...
But what?
I don't know if she has the same feeling.
Have you thought about asking her?
- Asking?
- Dee...
...I know you don't believe in talking...
...and you've said that talking never got you anywhere...
...but how are you ever gonna find out anything...
...from anybody if you don't talk?
There will be coffee soon.
- I wanna ask you something.
- Yes?
I know I've done you real wrong...
...and even if I wanted...
...it's kind of late for apologizing.
I know there's no reason in this whole world...
...why you wouldn't like to step on something like me...
...but do you think you could ever take to a man who...
...dragged you from your home and done you the way I done you?
Well, I'll be damned.
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.
Oh, well, you two are gonna be very happy.
Mace, what'd she mean by that?
She just looked at me, hugged me.
Didn't say nothing.
Oh, boy.
Oh, you're a sorry...
Dee, you're so dumb.
- I am?
- Yes, you are.
- How'd you like a knock in your teeth?
- No, listen to me, Dee.
Do you wanna go up to Montana with me or don't you?
Do you wanna help me build our spread up there?
- I reckon, yeah.
- And the children, what about them?
- What children?
- Children of your own.
The ones you used to want.
What about them?
And her? Do you want her to go with you to Montana?
- It'd be right nice, yeah.
- Well, then go and tell her.
You're right. That's right, Mace.
Now, why didn't I think of that?
ROSCOE:
Bishop, close the door.
Come on in.
All right, tell them it's over, Roscoe.
Now, just so we understand one another...
...you make one move
I don't like, and I'll kill you.
Now, what's your real name?
- Mace Bishop.
- Bishop. You're brothers.
You hear that, Roscoe?
They're brothers.
All right, brothers.
Where'd you hide the bank money?
- What bank money?
- Oh, it's gonna be that way, is it?
The $ 10,000 your brother there took out of the Val Verde Bank.
$ 10,000 that he helped himself to when the rest of you lit out.
That's what bank money.
You robbed a bank? You, Mace?
Well, Dee, the bank was there...
...and I was there, and there wasn't very much of anybody else there...
...and it just seemed like the thing to do.
You know, it's not like something you never heard of.
Lot of people rob banks for all sorts of different reasons.
You just walked into a bank and helped yourself to $ 10,000...
...because it seemed like the thing to do?
That's about the way it was, yeah.
That's as well as I can remember, yeah.
I don't know what to say to you.
Well, just don't say anything, Dee.
Don't say a word.
Why, you old bastard.
Now I know what you meant by,
"I might be able to get some money."
You planned on us...
We were gonna start our new spread on stolen money?
Just a thought, Dee. Just a thought.
Well, I'm sure glad Mama ain't around to hear all this.
Well, I sure wish Papa was around to hear all this.
Wouldn't it be wonderful to see
$ 10,000 in Papa's hands?
$ 10,000 in the hands of a man...
...that didn't know there was that much money in the whole world.
I think I'm gonna be sick to my stomach.
Tie them up. Tie them all up!
We're going home in the morning, ain't we, July?
I sure hope so.
JOHNSON: I've found a place for you to sleep tonight, ma'am.
I don't mind sleeping here.
Oh, yes, ma'am, but I don't think you should.
It just don't seem right, somehow.
Right over there.
Now, there's no need to worry. There'll be somebody on guard all night long.
Now, this isn't much, but it's the best I could find.
You'll be safe here.
I was not worried about my safety.
You don't have to be with them Bishops now.
You know, I like them.
Beg your pardon, ma'am?
I said, I like them. Both of them.
I'd like to talk to you about something, Maria.
You have ridden a long way for nothing if it was for me.
- Look, I'm stable.
- I know.
- And I'm reliable.
- I know, July, but don't you...?
Roscoe said just because I like you...
...you don't have to like me back, and that's the truth, but...
Oh, what are you looking for, ma'am?
Nothing.
I have found it.
You men!
Pack all the water we can tote.
Throw away everything we don't need.
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.
And I don't wanna hear about your mama.
I don't wanna hear nothing about how disappointed you are in each other.
I don't wanna hear nothing about how the Lord will forgive you...
...for sinking so low.
Where'd you hide the money?
You know, it'd go a lot easier on you if you told me where it was hid.
What about my brother?
Money or no money, your brother's gonna hang.
Your kind don't live long in prison, Mace.
Why don't you tell him where it is.
Go on, give it to him.
Well, sheriff...
...I figure if I ever want money bad enough again...
...I can always rob another bank.
I never knew it was so easy.
Come on, help me up.
Don't do it, Bishop.
We'll get you out of this.
You ain't getting out of nothing, so shut up.
It's a long way to the border, sheriff...
...and I'm gonna take special pleasure in cutting your...
Tough world, isn't it, Mr. Chaney?
There it is...
...resting like a baby.
Is that really the best you could hide it?
Go tell July we're ready.
[GUNSHOTS]
July...
- Untie us!
- Get back on the floor!
Come on, sheriff, untie us and give us guns!
You'll never hold off that many!
- All right, Cort, turn them loose!
- Come on!
MACE:
All right, Dee.
JOE:
Pa.
Leave me be, boy!
MACE:
Pa! Get back in here!
I hope they kill you, you hear me?
I hope you die!
[SCREAMING]
[GASPS]
[SHOUTING IN SPANISH]
[SCREAMING]
[GRUNTS]
No!
[SCREAMING IN SPANISH]
[SHOUTING IN SPANISH]
MARIA:
My God.
When you hugged me, did that mean yes or no?
It meant yes.
You really would've been my woman?
My wife, I mean?
Yes.
- You'd have gone to Montana with us?
- Yes.
Did you hear that, Mace?
You here, Mace?
I'm here, Dee.
Babe was right.
A little old kiss never hurt nobody.
Dee?
Dee.
Did you mean what you said to my brother?
For the first time in my life.
I'm glad.
I'm awful glad.
Because, you see,
Dee always wanted to believe.
He always...
He always wanted the right things.
But there was just something in him.
It just...
It was always hard for Dee to see the light at the end of the trail.
It almost worked.
MARIA:
No one will even know who lies here.
Does it matter?
Perhaps not.
Our story tells of a man grown old
His blood's still warm
but his heart's grown cold
He thinks he's still the man he was
But the young poke fun at everything
Everything the old man does
Marshal Flagg, Marshal Flagg
As men grow old their footsteps drag
Younger folks start making jokes
They'll be laughing at Marshal Flagg
They'll be laughing at Marshal Flagg
Laughing
Laughing
At Marshal Flagg
A man recalls all his youthful days
When he tasted life in a million ways
He dreams his dreams, at times it seems
That he's only two times ten
That he's full of fire again
The man he was way back when
Marshal Flagg, Marshal Flagg
As men grow old their footsteps drag
Younger folks start making jokes
They'll be laughing at Marshal Flagg
They'll be laughing at Marshal Flagg

At Marshal Flagg
Damn red-headed chicken thief!
Blow his stealing head off.
Damn fox ate another one of my hens this morning.
Consarned thieving...
Well, get down off of there.
Come have a snort.
- Nippy, huh?
- Nippy, hell!
I damn near froze last night.
- Why didn't you sleep inside?
- Walls and roofs is for city folks.
- Well, then why did you build it?
- Never built nothing like it before.
Grundy, either your coffee or your liquor's getting awful rancid.
- Chaw?
- No, no.
- So what no-good you been up to?
- Just the usual.
- I saw some...
- What?
- Saw some...
- Grundy, will you please spit?
Saw some men yesterday.
Down by the flats.
- Who were they?
- Never seen them before.
- What'd they look like?
- Mean.
- What do you mean "mean"?
- Just mean. Ornery.
Well, what were they doing?
How many of them were there?
Not much of anything. Just sitting.
About a dozen of them.
Well, didn't you see anything or hear anything?
I heard a couple of names.
One was called Waco.
And another called...
I can't remember exactly.
McBride, MacLean, McKay, something like that.
- McKay? Did you say McKay?
- Something like that.
What did he look like, this fellow, McKay?
- Only saw his back.
- From the back then!
Well, he was tall, taller than the rest.
He wore them long Mexican spurs with the pointed rowels.
His horse and his clothes, what color were they?
Black. Whole outfit, horse and man.
Even his holster.
I remember that, because he wore it high on his belt.
Not low, like some of these showoffy young'uns.
John McKay. That's who you saw.
You mean the McKay? Big John McKay?
That's right.
Thought he was killed years ago, down along the Red River.
So did I.
Thanks for the coffee.
- If you need an extra gun, count me in.
- Thanks, Grundy.
Hot damn!
There's finally gonna be some action around here.
Up. Here you go.
You weren't so eager to get rid of me last night, Jed Davis.
Come on, Ginny, there wasn't nothing personal about it.
Nothing personal!
Be the first time you ever laid hands on me that it weren't personal!
High time they closed that dirty place.
Been the shame of this city.
Harold!
- Hi, Nell.
- I don't know you, do I?
- Bye, Nell.
- I sure as hell should remember him.
Harold, you tell me immediately how you know that woman.
Harold! Answer me this instant.
She's a friend of Pa's.
Hey, Nell, give us something to remember you by.
This'll remind you of what you'll be missing, boys.
- That's my garter.
- No, it's mine.
Give me my garter, will you?
- I swear to...
- Fight!
I never figured on this much fuss.
Well, Howard, fuss is publicity.
Publicity is votes. Remember that.
I congratulate you, Mayor Wilker.
That establishment was a blight on the entire community.
Right you are, Mrs. Peters.
It's a civic disgrace. The work of the devil.
Don't worry, Ed.
The house will be open right after election.
Good. Good. Good.
Oh, good.
Come on, Howard.
So long, Charley.
Dirty thing.
Take your hands off me!
Bye. No hard feelings anymore.
Goodbye!
Bye.
This is for you, Jim, for being the nicest marshal we've ever known.
All right, girls, let's hear it for the marshal.
- Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!
- Hip, hip, hooray!
Well, back to the office.
Public servant's work is never done.
- Mayor.
- Yes?
Oh, Flagg. Good morning.
Gonna need about 20 men.
Volunteers for a posse.
- Posse? Did you say posse, Jim Boy?
- That's right.
You have them bring their guns and ammunition, meet me over at the courthouse, and I'll get them sworn in and we'II...
Wait a minute, Jim. Now wait.
What is all this posse talk?
You know that train that's due Saturday with the money for the new bank?
- Yes.
- Well, I think there's gonna be a holdup.
- Holdup?
- That's impossible.
John McKay has been seen in the territory.
And who the hell is John McKay?
Who the hell is John McKay?
For your information,
Mayor Wilker and Deputy Boyle,
John McKay is one of the most wanted outlaws in the country.
Oh, you mean Big John McKay, that old-time train robber.
- That's right.
- Sure, I remember now.
I read about him in the pulp books.
He used to be pretty famous around the time the James boys was cutting up.
The James boys?
Ye gods, that's over 20 years ago!
Yeah, but wasn't he killed, somewhere down in Texas?
Well, if he was,
I wouldn't be standing here saying he's planning a holdup, now would I, Mr. Boyle?
Yeah, but the book said that...
I don't give a damn what the book said, the man's alive!
Wait, wait, wait a minute, Jim Boy.
Now, calm down. "Holdup," "posse"...
We haven't used those words in... In years.
Well, in case you've forgotten, Mayor, they mean trouble.
Which is exactly what we're gonna have if we don't quit jawing and start moving.
And we're gonna have even more trouble if we go off halfcocked and get this whole town up in arms.
We're not going off halfcocked, the man is dangerous.
Wait a minute, Jim, let's...
Let's be sensible.
If he was alive, this man would be 100 years old!
He's no older than I am!
I'll tell you what, Jim Boy, let's go over to your office and discuss this in a rational way, shall we?
Jim Boy, this place needs air!
Get a window open.
- Scared the hell out of me.
- Not as scared as you're gonna be.
There's our man.
Do something about those windows, will you, Jim Boy? You look peaked.
Well!
This is more like it.
A man can work in here.
Space. There's light. There's air.
It's very nice, Howard.
Yes, neatness indicates organization.
Organization promotes productivity.
I'm impressed, Howard.
Well, I hope you'll be impressed when
McKay hauls off $100,000 on Saturday.
Now look, Jim, this poster is 20 years old if it's a day.
- Now, it cannot be the same man.
- Well, it is.
I had a detailed description.
A description?
I thought you said you saw him.
I said he was seen in the territory.
Then you actually did not see him?
- No.
- Well, who did?
- A fellow named Grundy.
- Grundy?
Jim! That crazy, whiskey-guzzling old sot in the hills?
- He is not crazy.
- You can't be serious, Jim Boy.
You mean you'd turn this town upside-down and create a panic over some wild bandits or some bank robbers on the word of a lunatic hiding up in the hills?
He's not a lunatic, and he's not hiding in the hills!
- He just don't take to city life.
- No, we can't risk it, Jim.
Not with an election coming up.
Now, if you told me that you had seen McKay with your own eyes,
I would consider a plan of action.
But this is just... This is just hearsay.
You can't run a town on hearsay.
We'd be the laughingstock of the state if this turned out to be a wild goose chase.
Jim, go home.
Forget about posses and holdups and the like.
- Time marches on.
- Well, I'm still marshal of this town.
And as long as I am,
I aim to do my job the best way I can.
I'm forming a posse.
I'd like your cooperation, but if needs be...
Jim Boy. Jim, wait a minute.
Now, Saturday is two days away.
Now, all I'm asking for is a couple of hours to analyze the situation.
Now, that's fair enough, isn't it?
- Well...
- You're a reasonable man, Jim Boy.
Howard, I'd like...
Howard.
I want you to walk me to the office.
I have something
I want to discuss with you.
James Flagg.
You are late for supper!
You know what time we sit down.
I mean, I don't run a restaurant here.
I haven't got time to eat anyway, Mary.
- Hi, Jim.
- Hello, Billy.
Marshal Flagg, Billy, you know that.
Boy, you should've seen all the ruckus in town today.
A whole bunch of ladies were piled aboard the train and the mayor was there and everything.
- Yeah, I saw it.
- Where are they going?
- Who?
- The ladies.
- Another town, I guess.
- Why?
Billy!
- Ma!
- And don't call me "Ma."
Did they wanna go?
I don't suppose it occurred to anybody to ask them, Billy.
They weren't bad, were they?
I mean, if they'd been bad, you'd have run them out of town, wouldn't you?
Yeah, Billy.
If they'd been bad, I'd have run them out.
Then if they weren't bad and they didn't wanna go, how come they went?
Well...
Billy, someday you'll learn that people don't always agree on what's good and what's bad.
Now, about those ladies, they were just practicing the oldest profession on earth.
I thought being marshal was the oldest profession.
- No, that's just second oldest.
- Well, then what's first?
You got yourself into this, you get yourself out.
Well, Billy, you see, the...
The Lord made men and he made women.
And he...
Well, he didn't make them quite the same.
Gee, I know that.
- But why'd...
- Billy, that's enough questions.
Now, why don't you just run along?
Grownups don't tell kids nothing.
- Ma! Howard Boyle's here.
- Billy.
Come on in, Howard.
- Evening, Mary.
- Evening.
- Marshal.
- Howard.
The mayor wants to talk to you, Jim.
- Already?
- Yeah.
He decided to cooperate, huh?
I think you ought to come down and see him yourself.
- You tell His Honor I'm on my way.
- Okay.
And, Howard, start rounding up a posse.
- I'd like to be on the flats by sunup.
- Right.
What's this about a posse?
Nothing to worry about, Mary.
Not now, anyway.
Jim.
- Be careful, will you?
- I'll be back.
Maybe then I'll take you to dinner.
Jim! Jim Boy, come on!
Come on!
Come on, Jim, this is for you.
Come on, this is it for you, Jim Boy.
Folks, this is a great day for our town.
Today we're gonna pay our respects to a man who has devoted 20 years of his life to make this a safe and decent place to live in.
You know, when Marshal James Flagg came to our fair city, it was untamed, lawless, frontier town.
But with honesty, resolution and dedication, regardless of personal danger,
James Flagg has tamed this town and made it the prospering community we all enjoy today!
And so it's come time for us to pay the debt we all owe to this courageous man and to show our appreciation for a job well done.
Jim Boy, in appreciation for long and outstanding service, we present you with this gift.
Well, open it, Jim Boy, open it.
Read the card, Jim, read the card.
"To James Flagg, Marshal emeritus."
Yes, that's the sentiment we're gonna inscribe on it later.
I didn't have time today.
And, folks, with the watch goes a full pension for life!
Carefree days of whittling and fishing.
And each year henceforth, this day shall be known as Flagg Day!
Now we all know that it's gonna be mighty difficult to fill Marshal Flagg's boots, but there is a man among us who's gonna give it a first-rate try.
Howard Boyle has youth! He has integrity.
He's bold, ambitious and he's honest.
And he will give us the kind of law enforcement that we all need.
I give you Howard Boyle.
"It's a... It's a great honor to..."
Louder, louder.
"It's a great honor
"to be chosen marshal of this fine city.
"I shall endeavor to carry out the duties
"and responsibilities of my new office
"in the fine tradition of my predecessor.
"With the..."
- Aid.
- "...aid and support
"of our great mayor and all of you,
"I feel confident of the continued growth
"and prosperity of our great city."
Thank you.
Howard, thank you.
And now, by way of celebrating, the town treasury, with a little persuading from me, has decided to foot the bill at Polly's.
Drinks on the house.
A lawman's lost when he has no star
And when you're licked
people know you are
They give him a watch and with that gem
In a minute flat he's just a bust
'Cause he's just like one of them
It's tough to hear
that you're all washed up
But he drinks the dregs of that bitter cup
He says, "You fool, keep cool, keep cool"
Then a door that's monogrammed
with his name is fiercely slammed
And then he thinks
"Well, I'll be damned"
Marshal Flagg
Marshal Flagg
Beneath his shirt his shoulders sag
Where to go, he doesn't know
No future for Marshal Flagg
No future for Marshal Flagg
No, thank you.
I still don't figure what you're gonna do.
You can't take them all on.
You aiming to get McKay first?
Don't know why you're even bothering.
Let McKay pull it off.
Teach that rotten town a lesson.
It's not the town's fault, Grundy.
They thought they were honoring me.
Honor!
Hell, they don't even know the meaning of the word.
Why, probably not more than a dozen even recollect what a hellhole that place was before you pinned on your badge.
Well, it's too late to do anything about it now. It's done.
I got McKay to think about.
- I'll get my gun.
- Oh no, you're not coming.
- Why not?
- It's not your job.
Well, it ain't yours no more either, damn it!
- They fired you!
- Thanks for the hospitality, Grundy.
You got a nice warm place in there.
You ought to try it sometime.
You go getting killed, don't come running back here.
Damn fool.
Damn fool!
Beats me.
- It's open.
- When the hell are we gonna move?
- Cards.
- Two.
Waco knows what he's doing.
- Found out about the shipment, didn't he?
- Besides, today's Friday.
The money don't come in till tomorrow, so what's the hurry?
The hurry is
I get jumpy just sitting around.
Jumpy?
What the hell's to get jumpy about this job?
Town full of hicks, it'll be a pushover.
Yeah, if there ain't any Pinkerton men.
For that kind of money, a man's gotta figure on some risk.
Risks or no risk, it sure beats the hell out of busting your back for $3 a day.
- Cards.
- Two.
Three.
It's your bet.
By me.
Your bet.
I swear one day I'm gonna stuff my boot right down that old man's mouth.
I don't know why we drug him along in the first place.
He's supposed to know this country.
He had a... Had a gang once that operated in these parts.
Hard to imagine, ain't it?
Him leading a gang.
Call.
That and that better.
Up.
Turn around.
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.
Name is Flagg. James Flagg. US Marshal.
Marshal? That old man?
Flagg?
McKay?
Get them saddled.
You spook them horses?
- I asked you a question, mister.
- He spooked them.
Sneaked up on McKay, I hit him.
- What do you want this old buzzard for?
- He says he's a marshal.
- He sure don't look like no marshal to me.
- This is James Flagg.
Now who the hell is James Flagg?
Who the hell is James Flagg?
He's the toughest marshal this side of the Mississippi.
Oh, yeah?
- What town you toughest marshal of?
- Purgatory.
He's the marshal of Purgatory down along the Forks River.
You're a little outside of your territory, ain't you?
Purgatory's more than
100 miles from here.
You sure this isn't another one of your wild stories?
If you're a marshal, let's see your badge.
I don't see no badge.
I lost it.
Well, the famous marshal lost his badge.
He's a marshal like you're Calamity Jane.
Mount them up, Deuce.
We're heading for Progress.
What are we gonna do with him?
Shoot him.
Can't go cold-blooded killing a man like that.
Well, then stay here and hold his hand.
Pick you up Saturday.
Better anyhow.
That way you'll be out of my hair.
Now wait a minute, Waco!
Now, listen, McKay, you're here on a free ride and you know it.
You're hanging on by your teeth.
Now, you want to come, you put a bullet in your marshal friend, here.
If not, you stay here and hold his hand.
Either way, it don't matter to me.
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,
I never would've believed it.
Now, don't you get any fool notions.
This is still my gang.
- Waco works for me.
- Oh, yeah, sure.
I never figured I'd see the day that
John McKay was rawhided by a green kid.
Rawhided? Look who's been rawhided!
You walk in here, broad as daylight, you take three steps and you get your scalp parted.
You put that cannon away, and I'll show you whose scalp gets parted.
Oh, no.
I leave fool stunts like that to marshals.
- Why, you flabby...
- Don't give me an excuse to use this.
All these years and you still get riled up just thinking about it.
I get riled up when I think about a man breaking his word.
- Never gave you my word.
- The hell you didn't!
Oh, the hell I did!
You told me that you wouldn't pull anything and the minute I turned around you damn near knocked my head off!
What'd you expect me to do?
Let you take me in and spend 20 years in jail?
I expected you to keep your word.
I promised. I never gave you my word.
Well, what the hell is the difference?
One's a promise, the other's my word!
That's the difference.
Oh, no.
Sun never set on the day that Big John broke his word to a friend or an enemy.
What was that business about me being Marshal of Purgatory?
Waco would've shot you right on the spot if he knew you were the Marshal of Progress.
- What's that to you?
- Nothing.
I just don't go for unnecessary killing.
I still can't get over it.
All these years and you're still hunting me.
I was hunting jackrabbits, not you.
Matter of fact,
I forgot about you years ago.
I heard you got killed down along the Red River.
Red River.
That job would've made the James gang look like city boys.
Three express cars!
More gold than in a dozen banks.
- And more Pinkerton men, too.
- Still don't know how I made it.
I did get two slugs. Right there.
Guess the bullet with Big John's name on it just ain't been fired yet.
You damned idiot! I'd have hit him!
Get him. Come on, boy.
Damn fool.
Carmel, you grow more beautiful every year.
Thank you.
To you.
I do feel wicked imbibing before sundown.
Well...
Voilà!
Sundown.
Oh, Mayor Wilker.
You know, Mayor Wilker is so... So formal.
My... My Christian name is Randolph.
- Randolph?
- Yes, but to you it's Randy.
- Now, Randolph...
- No, Randy.
Randy, we must remember I'm a Mrs.
I, my dear, am a mister.
- Please! If my husband knew, why...
- Never fear.
Your husband is aware only of engines, valves, gasoline.
- It's true, I'm afraid.
- Yes.
Every weekend he's out and about in his automobile, while you, in the bloom of your youth and beauty, are left alone, unattended, like an unplucked rose!
- Yes.
- Wasting away.
- Yes. Yes!
- A victim of internal combustion.
That's why we belong together, Carmel, dear.
You, a Ionely woman.
I, a Ionely public servant.
Both of us love-starved victims on the altar of progress.
Are you Ionely?
Lonely?
Carmel, dear.
When I sit at my desk, pondering the awesome responsibilities of my office,
I'm probably the Ioneliest man in the world.
- You poor man.
- Yes.
So your mayor needs assistance, devotion, and patriotic support.
You are patriotic, aren't you?
I'm a member of the DGW.
The what?
Daughters of George Washington.
We're more patriotic than anybody.
Well, that's what I'm gonna appeal to, your patriotism.
There.
There.
You see, what I need... What I need is the warmth of my constituents.
- Yes, the warmth.
- Their affection.
Yes, their affection.
Their spiritual sustenance.
Yes, their spiritual substance.
Yes, my dear, substance.
Mayor.
Randolph.
- Randy!
- Mayor?
Yes? Flagg!
Well, it's nice to see you, Mrs. Flannahan.
We'll discuss your suggestion at the next council meeting.
Have you gone crazy?
- Mayor, this is...
- Don't you know what doors are for?
- Mayor...
- Don't you know how to knock?
- But...
- Are you totally out of your mind?
Will you listen to me?
It'll take a $10 bottle of perfume to smooth this over.
- Mayor, this is Big John McKay.
- I want to get to the Emporium.
Didn't you hear me, Mayor?
This is John McKay.
- Fella I was telling you about.
- Yes, yes.
Of course, we'll discuss it later.
- But his gang is in town right now.
- Right you are, Jim Boy.
But, Mayor, the bank! Tomorrow's train.
The money!
Look, Jim Boy, you're retired.
Now you don't have to think about those things.
Now, just go home, relax, go fishing.
- Boyle can handle these things.
- These men will eat Boyle alive!
Come on now, Jim, don't exaggerate.
Now, Jim Boy, you know my office is always open to you, but next time knock a little.
You know what I mean?
You scare the hell out of a man, barging in like that.
And both of you, take a bath, you're a sight!
Listen, Jim Boy, could you stop at the Emporium and...
You buy your own damn perfume!
Right you are, right you are, Jim Boy.
Retired? Jim Boy! Jim Boy's been retired.
What'd they do, throw you out for some fancy-pants young dandy?
- Come on, move.
- So that's it, ain't it?
After all those years, they give you a gold watch and a pat on the back and a kick in the ass, didn't they?
They say there's no honor among thieves.
Look.
What's happened makes no difference as far as you're concerned.
You're my job, badge or no badge.
Now mount up.
Come tomorrow, I'm gonna take you over to the county seat and turn you over to the US Marshal.
Where to now?
You go back up on your mountain and try to stay out of trouble.
- Yeah, but, Jim, you...
- Will you do like I said, Grundy?
Damn fool!
Just like you said, Waco, train's due at 9:00 tomorrow morning.
You seen that new bank yet?
It's gonna take a ton of dynamite to blow it.
That's why we ain't gonna try.
- I thought you told me the plan was...
- Plan's been changed.
We'll make our move at the depot when they unload the money from the train.
And we hit them from all sides at once.
You two spread the word.
We'll meet at the depot in the morning.
Tell the boys to stay out of trouble tonight.
Tuber.
One schooner. Hi.
That'd warm a man's bed on a cold night.
This thing is over,
I think I'll get me one just like her.
Why wait?
How about a drink, honey?
I don't drink with customers.
Deuce!
Waco don't want no trouble tonight.
Here we are.
- Here, let me help.
- Oh, that's all right.
Well, I'm pleased to know there's one gentleman here, anyway.
James, are those really necessary?
- Yes, they are really necessary.
- Thank you anyway, ma'am.
It's all right.
- That's delicious.
- Really?
- As good as Mrs. McKay's?
- Mrs. McKay's?
You really believe there's a woman fool enough to get hitched up with the likes of that one?
James Flagg,
I'll ask you to mind your manners.
You may have your reasons for behaving like this, but as long as Mr. McKay is a guest in my home,
I want him treated courteously.
Courteously?
- That thieving, low-down...
- James!
I'm sorry, Mr. McKay.
It just seems that some folks have never really learned proper manners.
Thank you, ma'am. But I've...
I've learned to make allowances.
Well if there's anything else you'd like, just call.
- Good night, ma'am. And thank you again.
- You're welcome.
Jim Boy, the sugar.
I'll take just a smidgen.
- Jim Boy?
- I'm a guest.
Just a smidgen.
Thank you.
- Mrs. McKay. That'll be the day.
- There was.
- Was what?
- A Mrs. McKay.
I don't believe it.
When could you've gotten married?
After the Red River job.
I was shot up pretty bad.
So I went up to Canada for a spell.
There was this woman...
So?
Forget it.
Well, who was she?
A Quaker gal.
You have got to be the world's biggest liar.
Are you telling this straight?
A real fire and brimstone Quaker?
Well, if you're not lying, how come you're not up there in Canada with your wife?
She died.
The fever. Two days, it was all over.
Everything.
Any young'uns?
One. A boy.
It's been five years since I seen him.
- Who's taking care of him?
- His ma's kin.
Five years, that makes him almost 11.
How about you, did you ever get hitched?
Nope.
Never did.
- Billy, what are you doing up this late?
- I heard you talking.
It's you, Mr. McKay.
Beats me how you'd even know who it is anymore.
Gosh, Mr. McKay,
I knew it was you the minute I saw you.
Jim's told me all about you.
Why, he says you're the most famous train robber in the whole world.
Did you come to rob a train, Mr. McKay?
Don't you think you'd better get back to bed, Billy?
Jim, do I have to?
Your ma catches you down here, she's gonna tan all our hides. Now get.
Hey, Billy.
I'd consider it a favor if you'd sell this poster to me.
Oh, no, sir.
Jim gave it to me for my scrapbook.
I could never sell it, not for anything.
I understand.
But here.
What ever happened to the rest of them, the ones that didn't go to Red River?
They're gone. They're all gone.
Smiley was hung, over Tulsa way a few years back.
Jessup was killed by the Pinkertons on the Union Pacific.
Blanchard was shot in a stud game over in Tombstone.
Doc Samuels put a bullet in his own head.
They're all gone.
- What about your bunch?
- The same. They're all dead.
Owens. Blake. Kincaid. Haggarty.
Even old Dawson.
Marshal Abilene?
Eyes got so bad he couldn't hit a six-foot fence.
They still bushwhacked him.
Shot him in the back, at night from an alley.
Back-shooting, bushwhacking...
That's all the young ones know nowadays.
They got no pride, they got no honor.
Just ain't no fun anymore.
You got a privy out back?
What do you mean, out back?
The name of this town is Progress.
We got one right here in the house.
- In the house?
- Yeah.
Right there under the stairs.
You gonna hold my hand?
Well, I'll be damned!
Grundy.
Well now, time sure ain't been no enemy of yours.
- You look fine, Polly.
- Thanks.
Now what brings you to town?
Oh, I just figured I'd pay a visit, see how civilization's coming along.
Ain't too encouraging.
Ralph, a glass of our worst for my friend.
You tired, boy?
Store-bought whiskey! Ain't got no kick.
She ain't too good to drink with an old mule skinner.
Guess whatever women want, you ain't got.
Yeah?
Watch.
Hey, I thought you didn't drink with the customers.
That's right.
Well, what do you call this old rummy?
- Rummy?
- He's a friend.
Well, that's all I wanna be, honey.
Just a friend.
Why, you...
You just made a bad mistake, old man.
Don't. Drop it! Drop it!
You're a pushy one, ain't you?
Well, you're still young, maybe you'll learn.
Thanks for the drink, Polly.
Old man!
Grundy!
Oh, Grundy.
Well, somebody get a doctor, hurry!
Polly, get me to Flagg.
It was a fair fight.
Fair fight?
He didn't have a chance.
Now it's your turn, mister!
- Polly, put the gun down.
- No!
I'll take that gun.
Come get it.
Thanks.
Anytime, Marshal.
I believe in law and order.
Come on, I'll help you get him to the jail.
There was a razor.
Oh, the hell with them.
Jim! Grundy!
Grundy, for the love of...
They're all over town.
I thought I told you to stay out of trouble.
I could have took him, Jim, if he'd fought fair.
I could have took him.
Jim, I...
Jim, you're out-gunned.
There's nothing you can do about it, short of taking on a dozen men and getting yourself blasted all the way to hell.
You got any bright ideas?
Going fishing sure does take the miseries out of a man.
Gonna have to fix that, one of these days.
Once every fall for 10 years you've said that.
Yeah, I guess.
It's cold.
- Let's go on inside, huh?
- I'll be along.
You'll just catch your death standing out here.
I'll be along, Mary.
Jim, I know what's going through your mind.
But please, don't do anything foolish.
He was my friend, Mary.
- He died doing my job.
- I know.
But there are too many of them.
You'll just get yourself killed, too.
Maybe it should have happened a long time ago.
Men like me and McKay in there, we've outlived our usefulness.
Why, that is just nonsense.
Why, you're as needed now as you ever were.
Yeah, that's why the town gave me that nice, shiny new watch yesterday.
Oh, I'm not just talking about the town.
You're needed here.
I mean, Billy needs you.
You're the only father he's ever known.
And I need you, too.
- Randy?
- Yeah.
You're not gonna desert me, are you?
Not after last night.
My dear, sweet Carmel, you know, nothing on Earth could provide me with more pleasure than spending the entire day with you.
Lolling idly, partaking of your bountiful fruits.
But consider this.
Would our love be as magnificent if it flourished at the expense of Progress' progress?
Could any man ask for more than you?
My sweet, I think not.
You're so handsome.
I wanna tell the whole wide world how wonderful you are.
Oh, no!
I mean, don't think I don't appreciate your gesture, my flower, but I don't need anyone to blow my trumpet for me.
Besides, I think it would prove prudent if our mutual respect remains a private affair.
Oh, by the way.
Your husband, what time was he expected to return?
Mayor! Mayor! Hey, Mayor!
- We wanna see the killer.
- Yeah, can we go to the jail and see him?
Wait a minute. What...
What's all this killer talk?
We don't have any killer in jail.
The heck there ain't! You know he's there.
The one that shot the old man.
- Grundy, that's his name. Grundy.
- Yeah, that's the one.
We want to see the killer that shot Grundy.
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, boys.
I'll go over and talk to Marshal Boyle.
If he says it's all right, then we can take a quick look.
I'll be right back.
We want to see him, Mayor!
Or we ain't gonna vote for you!
Little bastards.
Howard!
Howard. Howard.
- Good morning, Turk.
- Well, morning, Mayor.
- The Express on time?
- Last I heard.
Say, Turk, you notice anything funny going on?
No. No.
- Heard from your wife, Mayor?
- Wife?
Think she's enjoying herself back in St. Louis?
Yes. Yes, fine. Just fine.
Course I haven't heard when she's coming back.
See you around, Sam.
You done real good.
Now just sit back and relax.
Mary! Mary.
- Mayor Wilker.
- Yes. Where's Jim?
- Oh, right in there.
- Thank you.
Jim Boy, we're in trouble.
We are in big trouble. Good morning.
What's he doing here?
Well, what the hell did you expect me to do?
You wouldn't let me lock him up.
Oh, you're right. You're right.
I was a fool not to listen, a thickheaded fool.
But look that... That's water over the dam.
We can't cry over spilled milk.
Now look, the real problem is, what are we gonna do now?
They're all over town.
There's one holding a gun on Turk down at the depot.
- What about your boy, Howard?
- He's gone! Disappeared!
Do they suspect that you're onto them yet?
Yes, I think... No, I don't think so, no.
Listen, Jim, we've got to think of something!
- They're gonna rob the bank!
- Oh, no.
I don't think we have to worry about the bank.
What are you saying?
The way I figure, if they're bright, they'll have that money long before it gets to the bank.
Brilliant. Jim Boy, that's brilliant!
Of course, they'll steal the money en route. Of course.
- Well, how does knowing that help us?
- It doesn't.
Well, we just can't let them steal the money.
There's an election coming up in two weeks.
We'll pass out guns, arm the men.
And start a war? You think those people are gonna re-elect you if half the town is massacred?
You're right, Jim Boy, you're right.
This is gonna take something special.
Say, why don't you go up on the roof and pick off a few?
That's something special all right.
That's special enough to get Flagg's head blown off.
- You shut up, McKay.
- Wait a minute, now, Jim Boy.
Maybe Mr. McKay here has something constructive to contribute.
There's only one plan and it's as plain as the nose on your face.
You can't stop them from getting the money once the train gets into town.
And since they're covering the telegraph, you can't stop the train from coming into town.
What you gotta do is stop the train from stopping in town!
- What? Stop the train from stopping?
- The train just steams right on through.
Fellas down at the depot would be looking mighty foolish.
But the train will stop, it always does!
Not if somebody boards it and tells them not to.
A tremendous idea.
That is bold, that is inventive, it is audacious.
It's worthy of your reputation, Mr. McKay.
I am impressed!
- Well...
- Well, that's the plan, Jim Boy.
We ride out of town, board the train, just roar right on through.
- What do you mean we?
- Well, of course I'm coming.
You don't think I'd let an opportunity like this slip by, do you?
I mean, have you any idea what this can do for my career?
Oh, I can see it now.
Crisscrossing the country, delivering lectures on law and order.
The need for positive action!
Civic responsibility!
Yes, I could write a book.
I could write a weekly column syndicated all over the country.
The world.
You know, I could be governor.
Maybe even president.
President Randolph Wilker.
Oh boy, there'd be no stopping me.
- Mr. President.
- Yes?
I should mention something kind of important.
- Please, go ahead.
- If you're gonna pull this off, you're gonna have to board a train at a dead run, and if you ain't careful...
- Dead run, that means while it's moving?
- While it's moving.
If you ain't careful, you could wind up like Dusty Boggs.
- Dusty Boggs?
- He boarded a train once.
- Oh, what happened to him?
- I don't know.
All we found was a grease slick along the cinder bed.
You make an excellent point, Mr. McKay.
Yes, I should be more prudent.
I have a whole town to worry about.
If this was for my own safety, there'd be no hesitation, but I do have a public trust.
Country's just lost a president.
Tell you what you do, Mr. Mayor.
You go downtown, circulate around, let yourself be seen, and just don't let on that you suspect anything.
- Right, Jim Boy. What are you gonna do?
- Board the train.
- Alone?
- Alone.
Well, what about McKay here?
Why can't he go along?
- Because he's one of them, that's why!
- Not anymore, he's not.
Isn't that right, Mr. McKay?
Yes, ma'am.
As of that old man, Grundy,
I ain't got no ties.
Like I said,
I don't go for unnecessary killing.
Then you'll go together.
There. Now shake.
- Do I have your word this time?
- You got it.
They're partners now in a frantic chase
Determined looks are upon each face
They ride through the trails
of the Ionesome hills
And you know these men are real men
Real men with iron wills
There's just one thought
running through each brain
They won't give up
till they catch that train
They work and sweat to pay a debt
To a most ungrateful town
They said that Flagg's a clown
The folks who let the marshal down
Jump!
Come on, you can make it!
Come on.
Guess I'm a bit rusty.
- Throw up your hands!
- Reach for the sky.
- We got you covered.
- Relax, fellas.
My name is James Flagg,
I'm the Marshal of Progress.
Marshal, huh? Let's see your badge.
I don't happen to have it with me right now.
I know you. You're Big John McKay.
I was on the Missouri-St. Paul in '88 when you and your outlaw gang robbed us of $18,000.
Now, there is gonna be a train robbery.
But we're not the ones that are gonna pull it off.
You bet your boots you ain't!
One move and I'll splatter you all over the rear of this car.
Lock them up, Bump.
We'll be in Progress before long and then we can turn these two varmints over to the real marshal.
- Where'll I put them, Tick?
- Put them in the privy.
- It's a good place for their kind.
- All right, come on, move!
Move!
Just keep calm, folks.
Everything's well in hand.
Inside.
Imagine him remembering me after all these years.
Bumper, you stay and guard them, and watch them like a hawk.
Yes, sir. Don't worry none about me.
Marshal! Marshal Boyle!
- Is Marshal Boyle here?
- You got eyes, ain't you?
You're the hooligan that killed that old man last night, aren't you?
What of it?
Well, hanging is too good for the likes of you.
If I were a man, I'd take you out and give you a good thrashing.
Weren't for that dress, I'd think you were a man, you ugly old wart.
Wart!
Ugly!
Ugly old wart!
Good citizen was just here asking for you.
Just figured you'd like to know you haven't been forgot.
This damned thing is smaller than I remember.
Bridge! Bridge! Bridge! Bridge.
- Morning.
- Morning.
I got the skinny one, Tick.
Come on, we'll head them off up front.
- You hit?
- Hit, hell! I just slipped. Come on, let's go.
Relax, folks, nothing to worry about.
We got them, Bump.
Flooded.
Harry, the train.
Doris, we are here. The depot is there.
Trains stop at depots.
Harry. Harry.
It doesn't seem to be slowing down.
- Are you sure, Harry?
- Doris, please.
Harry, it didn't stop.
Everybody! Hey! Stop, stop! Stop!
Everybody! Up in arms!
Up in arms, everybody!
They're gonna rob the train.
Follow that train.
- Everybody!
- Tallyho!
Three no trump.
That's it, boys, we're gaining on them.
Four of hearts.
They're the bad guys, not us, and they're gaining on us!
Now what can we do?
Look, get me down! Get me down!
Hey, what the hell's he doing?
Double.
They're gonna attack us.
Damn it, I quit!
Beats the hell out of me.
Jump!
Redouble.
Hey, dynamite! Dynamite!
Let's get out of here!
Come on, the honor of Progress is at stake.
Come on, men, come on.
Forward!
Stop!
I think he's trying to tell us something.
Stop! The bridge is out!
That's what he's trying to tell us!
Pull!
She's running wild! Jump!
Hell of a way to run a railroad.
Get that money out of there!
Hurry it up! We ain't got all day!
See them?
Maybe we ought to get out of...
Should we join them?
Let's get the hell out of here!
Waco!
You sure got style, McKay.
I'll say that much for you.
- I thought I could beat him.
- You beat him.
Jim! Jim Boy, you did it!
And you, Mr. McKay.
I have never witnessed a more splendid example of audacity and valor.
This story will be told and re-told around campfires by men who still admire courage and...
And daring and...
- Yes, sir?
- Pardon me.
I'm Dave Cargo of the New Mexico Press.
How do you do, sir?
Is there any truth to the rumor that you're thinking of running for governor?
Governor?
Well, I must say I never even thought about state office.
The responsibilities of mayor are awesome enough, but governor?
One can't be selfish,
I mean, if the country needs...
I mean, the state needs me I...
I've never been one to say no to anyone in need.
For example, now you...
You take Progress...
Excuse me.
You take Progress, for example.
Now, I came here...
You know something?
I do believe one day that man could be president.
Yeah, he's amazing, there's no getting around it.
That's the real 20th century man.
Hey, that was quite a show you guys put on.
Hey, look, Jim, I don't pretend to be half the man you are.
I doubt if I ever will be.
I... I'd appreciate it if you'd take the badge back.
No, you can keep the badge, Howard.
I'm a retired man.
- Yeah, but the town needs you.
- Not anymore.
No, you'll do just fine, Howard.
- Just one thing.
- What's that?
You have to learn to tell the good guys from the bad guys.
Catch that horse, McKay.
Well, Flagg... What the hell are you doing?
- I'm taking you in, McKay.
- Taking me in?
I didn't promise, and I didn't give you my word.
The sun never set on the day that James Flagg broke his word to friend or enemy.
Now wait just a damn minute!
When you get out of jail you can take that boy of yours fishing.
He'll be an old man by the time I get out of jail!
Oh, I doubt that.
Not after the way you helped out today.
Come on, let's go.
Flagg, you ain't even a marshal.
Now you know damn well the first time you turn your back
I'm gonna clout you over the head and run off.
A man is young then a man grows old
Flagg!
His blood's still warm
but his heart grows cold
Flagg!
He knows he's still the man he was
And the folks are proud of everything
Everything the old man does
Damn you, Flagg, listen to me!
Marshal Flagg, Marshal Flagg
He doesn't boast and he doesn't brag
Now younger folks
Aren't making jokes
They're cheering for Marshal Flagg
Yes, they're cheering for Marshal Flagg
Cheering for Marshal Flagg
ORTEGA - BANDIT WANTED
FOR CRIMES POLITICAL & CIVIL
AGAINST THE REPUBLIC OF MEXICO
2,000 - ORTEGA
Bastards! Scum! Come back!
Come back, you thief!
Do something, you sons of goats!
He has taken my best girl!
You will hang, Ortega!
For God and the Republic you will hang!
BLUE
This food is not cooked, Soledad.
Mine has too much salt.
Silence. Speak to your mother with respect.
Soledad is Xavier's mother.
She is my mother.
Who remembers?
I have many sons. And many sons should have many mothers. Is logic.
Also more enjoyable.
Now go to the whore Inez who you will not remember.
I have sons here who are sons.
We must honour this harlot.
She's famous in the world.
One time in the capital, she serviced a whole military prison.
On a Sunday.
Azul, the woman wishes you first.
Come to her, Azul.
I've lit her fires for you.
I do not understand.
This Azul will kiss the lips of the Captain of the Police... but he will not kiss Inez.
Has he not heard of my fame in the capital?
We do not use our knives to kill our brothers.
Now shake the hand.
You will make peace with my son.
A gringo is your son?
This one is no gringo. No more.
He has become my son.
As you are, Xavier.
You will shake the hand.
I have ordered it!
There's a sweet smell in the night,
Carlos, but you wear a sour face.
Go away.
You are a fool, Angel.
It is good for young boys to fight.
It turns them into men.
You've learned little of this life, my brother.
I have learned to be a leader of men.
You're a leader of bandits... teaching the one who is not your son to be the same.
I am a leader of revolutionaries... and if I choose Azul above the others... it is because Azul is worth more than my blood.
He's more like me than my blood... and one day, will be a leader as I am.
For the cause, Carlos.
- We do not fight for the cause anymore.
- Take care, old man. You provoke.
I will provoke if I wish.
I'm older than you.
Do you think your men are not tired of the way that we live?
They do not wear sour faces, but behind their faces they doubt now.
They question and they wonder.
You say we must destroy the French and the Spanish... and the rich Yanquis who devour Mexico and swallow her bones.
And yet we do not attack the French and the Spanish.
And the rich Yanquis, if they are rich... stay on their side of the river.
No, my lovely brother.
We only play games, children's games... or the games of madmen.
What is the day today?
A Thursday. The third day of July.
So I believed.
We will do something new tomorrow.
In the north.
The land across the river belonged to the people of Mexico... before the gringos took it for their own.
Now, on the day these Yanquis call their Day of Independence... we go back for land.
And what our regular armies could not keep for us, we take.
Azul... and Xavier will lead.
I know what you think, that this is the land of your people.
But they are not your people now.
You are one of us.
They celebrate the Day of Independence as I had thought.
- Look at your boy.
- Look at him.
- Mighty fine boy.
- Mighty pretty gal.
Save your energy for the wedding, Jess.
I reckon you and Doc will have to start putting up a wedding soon, Abe.
If our crops are good, God willing, maybe so.
But that's for the young folks to decide, wouldn't you say, Doctor?
You and Manuel. If there are people...
It sure can tire a girl, dancing with Jess.
Yes, miss.
Do you want to dance out the rest of your life with him?
Well, I admit he doesn't exactly hang the moon for me.
I like him. If I have to, I'll settle for him.
Do you really have to settle for anyone?
Now look, miss...
I don't want to hold you here like I held your mother.
I belong here, Pa. This is my home.
Come on, I wanna talk to you.
Charlie!
- Doc!
- Coming.
- Make way for the Doc.
- Let me get through.
- What happened?
- He fell out of that tree.
Let me take a look, Charlie.
My bag's home.
Here now, you take this thumb and this thumb... and press them hard together.
- Joanne, I'll come with you.
- Tarnation, Jess!
You fuss and fret too much over me.
I can look after myself.
It's nothing serious.
Let's get back to dancing.
Nobody upstairs.
No women, nothing.
Nothing nowhere. Rich Yanquis.
Come, Azul, there's nothing there!
GREASER
Please.
No!
Come on, let's go get them!
- Let me get on!
- No, Doc, no more room!
I've got to get to my daughter!
My daughter...
Find Azul and Manuel.
We will wait by the river.
Come on.
- He said for you to come.
- Leave the gringo.
Come, Azul, with me.
Leave him.
Come!
That's Joanne's buggy. Let me off.
Come on, get them!
Come on, men, hurry up there!
Come on, boys, let's go!
Come on, let's get him! Over here!
Pa, don't do that.
If it hadn't been for him...
They'll kill him, Pa.
Fair skin, blue eyes.
Now, how did he come to be with them?
We wait.
There is no use for more waiting.
It is too dangerous.
You do not understand.
Four sons are missing.
Antonio, Manuel, Xavier.
- Azul?
- Yes, all.
If they're alive, we find them.
We go back!
The gringos killed Antonio.
- And the others?
- Manuel was murdered.
By Azul, for attacking a gringo woman.
You are lying. You lie, Xavier.
We go back!
To kill him or to save him?
Which, my father?
We go back, but to Mexico.
We cross!
Pa had to work hard putting you back together.
We both undressed you.
I've been a doctor's daughter all my life.
I've seen more than one grown man in his natural state.
The spectacle holds no surprises for me.
Are you up to my asking a few pertinent questions?
What's your name?
I asked for your name, boy.
Now look, son, I don't expect gratitude for saving your life.
But I have a hunch you're strong enough to do some talking... so I'd like you to talk.
Where are you from?
We know you're not Mexican, boy.
Where do you belong?
I see. It's not that you can't talk, it's just that you won't.
Pa, it's not the time.
All right.
I'm not gonna force you now.
But later you're gonna tell me everything I want to know.
Here, you come along, miss.
Come along.
Let's give him a while to think things over a bit.
Should my tears forever flow
Should my zeal no languor know
All for sin could not atone
Thou must save, and thou alone
In my hand no price I bring
All I'm saying is the Governor ought to be made aware of the matter.
How do we know raids like last night ain't taking place all along the border?
There is no master plan in Mexico City, if that's what you're thinking.
The war's over, Jess.
A band of outlaws just crossed the river, so let's not make any more of it.
Well, I'll wager they never crossed back over the river.
I wager a few of them are still hanging around.
If that's so, we'll just have to take our chances.
Hell, I don't think we ought to take any chances.
Doc, Joanne.
If you're bound and determined to clear out of here, I'm not gonna stop you.
As a medical man, I may not advise it, but as a member of this community...
I'm sure not in favour of you staying.
So if you want to go, just go right ahead.
Well, what's holding you?
Sit down, boy. It's wiser.
Since it's obvious that you have to put up here for a spell... accept that fact and answer those questions I asked you earlier.
Don't try me, boy.
Just because I patched you up doesn't mean I can't let others string you up.
There's no point in saving a life if it's not worth saving.
- Where you going, miss?
- Chores, Pa. Possess yourself.
You're hell-bent on putting me to the test, aren't you?
All right. You're gonna get satisfaction.
You're gonna get it right now.
What's all that for?
Hush, Pa, no need to make noise for two. Excuse me.
Have you gone plumb crazy?
I just want to examine this wild man's face.
Easy, boy.
At this moment, I'm stronger than you.
Lather him up.
- Do as I say, Pa.
- Yes, miss.
I think you should know I'm not a woman of minor achievement... and I add to my list daily.
I cook, sew, undertake all the normal female activities.
And then in addition,
I handle a plough as well as a piano... split a log in record quick time and...
I'm just about as good as any man, huh, Pa?
Did I hurt you?
I'm fearfully sorry.
But with all my accomplishments,
I have...
Now, did I do it again?
How can I apologise? Except to say that
I've never shaved a man before.
So if my hand should falter and my fingers slip...
- I'll do it.
- The walls of silence have crumbled.
My God.
Hungry?
The wild man doesn't have very civilised eating habits, does he?
In time, Pa.
Infants crawl before they can walk.
- Now...
- Doctor, you to home?
You damn fool.
Another sound like that and they'll be up here.
Give me that gun.
I'm no hero, boy. The gun's empty.
What is it now, Jabe?
Alma's convinced she's got complications again.
I'm sure there's no cause for alarm.
Go right in.
You must be hungry.
You know, it's mighty awkward for me to still not know what to call you.
I can't go on calling you "sir" and "boy."
My name are...
My name is...
Azul.
That's Spanish for "blue," isn't it?
It's not my real name.
It's a kind of...
Nickname?
Yeah, nickname.
Put your shirt back on.
I'm all right?
All right? As much as most and more so than some.
Want a swig of some honest to goodness brandy?
I can go?
I asked if you wanted a drink.
It mightn't do you any harm to stay on a few extra days.
No, I figure I'll leave before sunup.
Whatever seems fair.
Since you haven't told us where you're from...
I don't imagine you'll let on where you're going.
Have you made any plans, Blue?
I see.
Right back where we started.
Before you go...
I think there's something you might wanna have.
We found this on you that first night.
It might be stolen goods, but I have a sneaky hunch it's not.
Your mother's?
Dead?
Where's he looking off to?
South.
Mexico, I guess.
Well, I reckon he feels they are more his people now.
He can't go back to them, Pa.
He killed one of them.
He's got nowhere to go.
No, miss.
What he does has to be his decision.
Leave him be, girl.
- Pa!
- Blue!
Pa, come down here quick!
- What is it?
- Something's happened!
What happened?
What? Where is he?
What in damnation...
He's talking, Pa.
- He's saying he wants to stay and work.
- That's talking?
He's gonna have to be a little less subtle to suit me.
Pa, use your senses.
We need a hand around the place.
We always needed someone.
- Have you forgotten what he is?
- Was, Pa.
You're always going on about giving a man a fair chance.
That's all Blue's asking for.
If you aren't the damndest... most ornery, most blackmailing daughter...
Yes, Pa.
That's why you love me.
Now I'm gonna tell Blue how delighted you are to take him on.
They're coming.
I sure do wish I'd never invited anybody.
Have a do, expect some doings.
Possess yourself, miss.
We can't hide him from people forever.
The good Lord and my daughter's needle sure work miracles.
Yes, sir, you look splendid.
My suit fits.
It fits splendid.
You are gonna do just fine.
Just stand tall and smile, and you'll win them over with your charm.
- Charm.
- Charm, yeah.
Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Jess.
- Evening.
I'm sure glad you could all come to our social.
Sure is nice seeing y'all again.
Looks more like a military drill than a social.
Might as well come prepared, Doctor, after what happened last time.
How you doing, Joanne?
Come on now, let's not dilly-dally.
Let's get in here and get this party started.
Yeah, charm.
I see you've finally gotten somebody to help you around the place.
He's come here to help us out.
You and Joanne can't farm this place alone.
Especially after what's been going on around here lately.
It's sure been nice talking to you,
Mr. Blue.
"The attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man...
"whom they had never seen before...
"of most gentlemanlike appearance...
"walking with an officer on the other side of the way.
"The officer was Mr. Denny...
"and he bowed as they passed.
"All were struck with the stranger's air.
"All wondered who he could be.
"Mr. Denny addressed them..."
We don't have many strangers come this way.
Last one was Mr. Saunders.
Stayed with the Corralls about five years ago, ain't that right?
Yes, all of five years ago.
You good at games like this,
Mr. Hamilton?
I used to be.
That's my boy Jess.
- He's real good at games.
- Yeah, I can see that.
Come on and join us in a hand.
Think we'd all like to see just how good you be.
"He had all the best parts of beauty...
- "a fine countenance, a good figure..."
- What are you, reformed, Mr. Hamilton?
You could say.
"...determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street..."
Just stretching my legs, Pa.
That's a mighty special rig you got there.
That's Mexican, ain't it?
"...turning back, had reached the same spot."
Pick them up.
I've seen a couple just like it on some outlaws.
Mexicans.
Doc tell you about the trouble we had not long back?
He's heard about it.
He hear about the stealing?
You tell him about the killings?
- What are you getting at, Jess?
- Nothing, Pa.
I'm surprised to see one of us outfitted like one of them, that's what.
Blue's from El Paso.
It's common enough to pick up
Mexican goods in a border town.
How many?
Yeah, that's for true, and the point is why bother?
Unless a body happens to be partial to bean eaters.
You partial to them?
Mexicans are no worse or better than anybody else.
Listen to that, folks.
He is partial to them after all.
I wonder if he don't shoot the way them greasers do... seeing as how he takes so to their gear.
I have a busy day ahead of me.
So if you'll excuse me, good night.
It's a crying shame.
I was gonna ask him to show off his shooting techniques to us.
And he says he's got a busy day ahead.
There mightn't be some other reason you're leaving our company?
There might.
I'm tired, Mr. Parker... particularly of you.
Well, are we playing or not?
Your deal.
What's gonna happen?
I guess there'll be some whispering and wondering... and a little speculating.
But it'll all die down soon enough.
They'll come to accept Blue.
What in damnation was that for?
If we're in it, we're in it, and we might as well see it through.
- He knows.
- He only suspects.
Nobody pays Jess any mind.
They can't forget.
Why should they?
I don't belong.
It can't work.
You do belong.
I guess I was brought out here... about the time your kin settled this spread.
What was it took them to Mexico?
What takes hold of most people who keep on the move... if that's the kind they be?
A place that sounds like it's the answer,
I guess.
My folks settled in Mexico when I was...
How old?
Five? Maybe six.
There was no trouble with the Mexicans at first.
Of course, in those days it was all one country, you know?
It was just their kind of people and our kind of people... living side by side.
Ranching, farming.
Till the war came.
The war with Texas, that is.
Then one night... a group of nice people from the village paid a call on us.
Said we'd have to clear out by morning.
My pa stood up to these nice people... and he said to them:
"You'll have to burn me out to make me go."
So the next day, they did just that.
They burned him out.
Burned him... and Ma when they wouldn't quit the house.
When it was over... there was this smell... and smoke.
And I just walked out of there.
Just walked... walked right out to the prairie... where another kind of Mexican... a bandit named Ortega found me.
Then he took care of me... brought me up to be just like one of his own.
Let's go.
Jess here says his sister's come down with the fever.
I'm gonna stay on a piece and talk to Joanne.
Would you care to honour me with your company?
Don't be too late.
We should be back in time for supper.
Come on, boy.
Now, there's a mighty fine piece of farmland... just waiting for someone to lay claim to it.
He's one of them. I know it. You know it.
For you and your pa to hide him here and try passing him off...
You've no proof of anything,
Jess Parker. Not a damn bit of proof.
I'll wager you and Doc heard some sobbing tale out of him.
That's what I wager you heard.
I wager you two think you can change him over... just by snapping your fingers.
People do change, Jess. They can.
That's the wondrous thing about people.
They change.
Jess, what are you aiming to do?
I haven't said a word you can honestly pin to him.
Please, Jess, leave him be.
I swear to you he's good.
- I swear to you that he's...
- Changed?
I wonder about that.
I really wonder about that.
And I maybe reckon to find out if it's so.
Jess, please, leave him be!
You comfortable squatting like that?
- You know how you're sitting, don't you?
- You tell me.
That's how a greaser sits.
You're sitting like a greaser.
- What is it you want?
- I don't like you.
- What's that gonna prove?
- What sort of person you really are.
- Which is what sort of person?
- One who ain't changed.
Don't prod me, boy.
Make sure she takes her quinine and she'll be up in a day or two.
- Jess!
- No, Pa.
Are you gonna get yourself killed for some crazy, damn fool notion?
Don't forget the quinine.
It has been a long time, Azul.
These people saved my life.
Permit me to thank you... for saving the life of my son.
It will be good to have you back with us,
Azul, as before.
Things have changed. I have.
Azul is no more.
Then I have lost three sons here... not two.
Azul was murdered... as Antonio was... and Manuel.
You did not save the life of Azul.
You took his life from him.
Why?
Leave him alone.
It's all right, Blue.
I can look after myself.
You?
You can look only after dirt because that is what you are, nothing else.
And that is what she is: Dirt.
Yanqui dirt!
No, we do not kill him.
Not this way.
So finally it is you who defies me.
All right, defy me then, and with the fist.
Yours against mine.
I don't wanna fight.
Have they turned you into a coward... as well as a traitor?
Fight me, I said.
Fight!
This business between us is not finished.
I will be back with all my men.
I will avenge the murders... of Antonio, and Manuel... and Azul.
And in their memory...
I will put the torch to each building and farm here.
I will burn out the murderers of my sons!
Look, clear out.
Clear out while there's still time.
Waiting around to be slaughtered, it's stupid.
I don't see we have any choice but to wait.
There's only one choice that makes any sense... and that's to live and go on living, and not to die.
I can't say I disagree with you.
But where do you want to do your living?
Don't you feel you belong here now?
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.
But I'm tired of hearing, thinking... worrying about where I truly belong.
Whether I'm one of you, or one of them, or one of anybody.
Maybe I just belong to me.
No, Pa. Let him go.
What do we know about fighting?
I'm a farmer and so is my son.
You're asking me what should be done?
I just don't know.
But to my way of thinking... we'd all stand a better chance of it by sticking together... instead of each one of us trying to make it alone.
That the only choices we got, Abe?
Why wait to see them set fire to our crops and houses?
I'll be damned if I leave my claim to some greaser to burn down!
I came out here alone, and I fought Indians alone!
- I'm with Jim!
- You ain't fighting a few Indians!
Those Mexicans are like an organised army.
Some of us once fought a real, organised Mexican army.
- You're no match for it.
- Abe's right! Let's get out!
- Maybe we should get out.
- Lf Abe goes, he goes without me!
I'll tell you one thing.
My husband never would've given up.
Maybe he should have.
Then he'd still be alive!
Hold on!
Quarrelling is not gonna get us nowhere.
We need to find a way to stand up to them!
I still say we should be back home defending our farms... instead of heading down to the river.
You argued that back at the meeting, and then we all agreed to go his way.
Agreed, hell.
You all agreed, but I'm still asking.
Why is he heading us down to the river?
Did you hear him talking as if he was the Lord Almighty himself?
"I'll lead you if you do what I tell you to...
"when I tell you to, and how I tell you to."
Why are we trusting him?
He could be leading us into a trap.
And he could have killed my boy Jess when he had cause.
No, Alma. I say we trust him.
Who called a halt?
I thought we could use a minute's breather.
It wasn't called.
- The heat.
- A breather's not gonna hurt anyone.
You'll do your breathing when I tell you to. Now move on.
You, too! Move on!
Take them wagons back to the canyon and hide them.
Most of you, stay here.
The others, cross over.
Jess, take the men across.
Start digging holes.
Dig them deep and brush them over.
All right, get those tools and follow me!
We start doing the same on this side.
Women, too.
BLACK POWDER
Cover it.
When you light them, how quick will they fire?
Come on, fellas.
You're in your own line of fire.
Fill them in and start over. Up there.
Hey, Jess, he says this hole ain't right.
Jess, move your men back over the river.
I figure if we come through this tomorrow... you and him will...
I no longer reckon what will be, Jess.
So much has happened.
You love him a lot, don't you?
I guess...
Good luck, Jess.
I want every gun cleaned and oiled right away.
So get to it.
Now we've gotta be fair with him, miss.
He's gotta be hard.
You're thinking of them, aren't you?
Blue, I know how hard it must be to have to kill those you once loved.
I still love them... in spite of what's happened.
And what will happen tomorrow.
But hard as it is for me... it's easy for me to kill also.
You saw these hands the night I was choking Ortega.
You saw how it pleasured me.
It pleasured me. I took pleasure in it.
Like I always did, like I always will.
I could never change, Joanne.
It's not possible... if it ever was.
Blue, I've lost you, haven't I?
Everybody, out of sight.
Xavier.
Signal.
It is too late for you to change face, gringo.
My father will not take you back.
Signal.
Careful. Head your horses into the current.
Go back!
Let's go back!
Come back!
Come back!
Cowards!
Hold your fire.
You have fought well, as a true leader should.
Ortega honours you.
Let me die on my side of the river...
Azul.

The End
Hide.
Hide.
What did he mean, "hide"?
- It must have been the sun.
- The sun didn't tie his hands.
Chico!
No, Chico. No.
No.
Drive them into the square.
Ole!
Ole! Ole!
Ole! Ole!
- Hello, Chris.
- Vin.
Thought you took a job ridin' shotgun for Overland.
- I quit.
- How come?
My health.
Doctor said to find a climate with less lead in the air.
What are you doing here?
Tracked a man across the line for bounty.
- Who?
- Ole!
You.
Well, ain't you gonna ask?
- What?
- Why I'm after ya.
You just told me. Bounty.
Hell, Chris, you think
I'd do a thing like that?
I came so you'd know there was a price on your head.
How much?
- Five hundred.
- Dollars?
Pesos.
Hell, it's enough some shypoke might throw down on you while you're asleep.
Maybe I oughta ride with ya, in case you need any help.
- Wouldn't want to put you to any trouble.
- No trouble.
No trouble at all.
Bravo!
Hell,...
.. let him fight.
- I'll pay for the bull.
- ? Ypagaras el entierro?
He wants to know if you'll pay for the funeraI, too.
Ole!
Ole!
Aha! Aha!
Friend of yours?
Petra.
- I prayed you'd be here.
- What is it, Petra? What happened?
Two days ago, many men with guns rode into our village.
Chico tried to fight them. It was no use.
All the men they did not kill, they drove into the square...
.. and took them off into the desert.
Coming here, we passed through two villages,...
.. both of them empty of men.
Only women, crying over their dead.
You say many men with guns.
- How many?
- I don't know. Fifty, maybe more.
They didn't say anything?
Where they were taking them? Why?
- Nothing.
- What do you make of it, Chris?
- I don't know.
- We can't fight a whole army of 'em.
Chico would, if it was the other way round.
Chico's a fooI.
Because he laid his gun aside,...
.. married Petra, tried to amount to something?
? Vamos esta noche, senor, o manana?
What did he say?
He wants to know if we are going after them tonight, or in the morning.
It's a big country.
Findin' 'em could take a long time.
Hell, I haven't been going anywhere for ten years.
Either have you.
Ain't it the truth.
Take them to my room.
They can sleep there.
- Where are you headin'?
- To get help.
- Findin' men ain't gonna be easy.
- Depends where you look.
- What about this one?
- He stole a pig, senor.
- A pig?
- Yes.
I can let you have him very cheap.
- This one?
- He caught his wife with another man.
Both of them.
This one is worth many pesos, senor.
- But if I were you...
- Open it.
- Senor...
- Open.
Hello, Frank.
Chris.
- Haven't seen you around.
- Haven't been around. Been in here.
He killed four men in a gunfight.
- That's a fact.
- How would you like to get out?
- I'm listenin'.
- Friend of mine's in trouble.
- How much trouble?
- About as much as you are.
- How many guns you up against?
- Fifty... Maybe more.
Anybody on your side?
How much?
The risk is very great, senor.
A hundred pesos?
- Fifty.
- He killed four men.
I could make it five.
Fifty.
- Where'II I find you?
- At the hoteI.
We're riding south in the morning.
You got a horse?
No... I'll get one.
He is not very friendly.
I'm not hiring friends.
Are you going to talk all night?
If you had any respect for a condemned man,...
.. you'd keep quiet and let him spend his last hours in peace.
- He is going to be shot in the morning.
- What'd he do?
Huh! What didn't he do?
That is Luis Emilio Delgado.
I take it you did not understand me, senor.
You are Luis Delgado.
- You know me?
- Heard of you.
Did I not tell you I was famous?
That is his last request.
You don't know how good that makes a man feeI.
- I can imagine.
- I mean you knowing my name,...
.. who I am.
For years I have said to myself
"Luis, the day will come...
.. when you'll not have to ride in the dust of others,...
.. when everyone will know who you are. "
"There'll not be a train or a village robbed that people will not say...
.. 'The one who robbed from us was el bandido Luis Emilio Delgado. "'
And just when I was about to amount to something, this had to happen.
What will people think of me when they find out I was shot for killing one man?
One stinking little man.
I have killed a dozen in a single day. More!
- I tell you, senor, there is no justice.
- What if they don't find out?
- But they will.
- Not if you ride south with me.
Against 50 guns, maybe more?
The odds are not good.
Better than you'll have against that wall tomorrow.
You've got a point.
Well?
- What is the pay?
- Whatever it takes to get you out.
- Fair enough.
- How much?
- But, senor, I cannot.
- A hundred pesos.
- They will stand me against the wall...
- I have a wife, six little ones...
Three. But I cannot let him go.
He will have to escape.
- Unlock it.
- Un momento, senor.
Do you mind if I escape first thing in the morning?
Hello, Chris.
It's gettin' so a fella can't find an unattached woman anywhere hardly.
Let's get out of here.
Whew! That was a close one, huh?
So was the last time.
And the time before that.
- When'll you ever learn, Colbee?
- How'd I know she was married?
Women ain't like cattle, with a brand to let you know they're another man's stock.
How would you like to use that gun belt for more than just holding up your pants?
A village was raided, a friend of mine taken prisoner. I need help.
Well, I'd like to give you a hand, Chris, but...
They took all the men... drove them into the desert.
I ain't been gettin' much sleep lately.
- Took off all the men, you say?
- Two days ago.
You mean there's a village full of women...
.. and no one there to help them with their plantin' and their harvestin'?
- No husbands?
- No husbands.
The hell you say.
How'd you do?
They any good?
They're alive.
Hey!
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?
- Basta con el pequeno.
- He said the little one had enough.
- But I had my money bet on him.
- You lost.
Why, you...
The little one's had enough.
Touch that gun, I'll kill you.
Are you all right?
Si, senor.
Senor... Me llamo Manuel.
Yo he oido que busca pistoleros.
? Podria llevarme?
He says his name is ManueI.
He heard we were looking for fighters.
He'd like to come along.
- You're gonna take him?
- For luck.
Counting Chico, that makes seven.
Buenos dias. It's a lovely day, no?
- You're late.
- I overslept.
Let's get the hell outta here!
Gracias.
- Coffee?
- Oh.
Don't mind if I do. Don't mind at all.
You'd never know she's around, would you, quiet like she is?
Had me a quiet woman once.
Outside she was calm as Sunday.
Inside she was wild like mountain scenery.
I'm gonna ride back that way again one of these days.
- Where's that?
- Sonora Town.
- I was there once.
- Once?
- You mean you didn't go back?
- For what?
Well, there's over ten head of females for every male in Sonora, that's for what.
And I oughta know. I went through over half of 'em one night.
And woulda got around to the rest of 'em if I hadn't pulled a leg muscle.
I was buckin' horses this side of the line and sellin' 'em tame up in Deming.
Now, a good amount of 'em was no more than hoorah girls,...
.. but the way I look at it, a woman's a woman.
Ain't that right, Frank?
You talk too much, Colbee.
Since when can a man talk too much about a woman?
- Since when?
- Colbee!
- You take the first watch.
- But you said Vin was a'gonna.
I changed my mind. Go on.
You didn't have to do that, Chris.
I wouldn't push him into a fight, if that's what you think.
If you had, you might have been in trouble. He's fast.
Fast as you are?
I'd hate to have to live on the difference.
I'll remember that.
Do that.
I wonder why the hell they took Chico and them others off.
Damned if I know.
Time we get to the village, blowsand will have covered up any tracks.
If we strike out blind, we don't stand a chance of findin' 'em.
Petra said there were two other villages raided.
That means they took close to 300 prisoners.
Only one way to move that many men on foot in the desert.
Like cattle.
From one water hole to the other.
Well, that don't narrow it down too awfuI much.
Lotta cow trails between here and the Sierra Madre.
Herds moving on them every day.
Word gets round.
What do we do in the meantime?
Drop Petra and the boy off at the village and start riding a wide circle.
- See if we can cut their traiI.
- That could take one hell of a long time.
I know. I haven't been goin' anywhere for ten years.
Vin, if you have to worry about something,...
.. worry about what happens after we find
Chico and the others, not if we find them.
I never thought I'd come back.
Vin, Colbee. Cut him down.
- Get 'em out of here.
- Llevatelos de aqui.
He escaped - and see what they did.
My poor little one.
The DeviI's Spine.
It ranges from the headwaters of the Concho, north to the border.
According to the woman, her husband escaped from a village about here.
That's where they're holding
Chico and the others.
- Did he say why?
- He wasn't there long enough to find out.
But there ain't no village between the DeviI's Spine and the Concho.
- That's what the man said.
- He was a long time in the desert, Chris.
He coulda been out of his head, got turned around.
- He found his way here, didn't he?
- I'll catch up the horses.
We'II leave in the morning.
Ride out tonight, we could save time.
Use up our animals, we'll be on foot.
We'II leave in the morning.
Better get some sleep.
You too, Colbee.
I wish to hell I knew for sure.
Knew what?
If I'm here because Chico's a friend, or if
I'm just on the prod for a fight like Frank.
Killin' can get inside of you.
And you think that's happened to you.
Why else would I be here?
Sure, Chico's a friend of mine, but...
Hell, I don't even know his last name.
Neither do I.
Don't it make you wonder?
No.
How the hell come, Chris?
Because in all the years
I've made my way with a gun,...
.. I never once shot a man just to see him fall.
That time ever comes,...
.. I throw my guns in the water bucket and ride out.
So will you.
- Who does he belong to?
- His parents are dead.
Chico looks after him like he was his own.
Chris, why would they take
Chico and the others away?
- I don't know.
- Maybe...
.. if you went to the Rurales, asked for help.
- It wouldn't do any good.
- But they are supposed to protect us.
- Have they ever?
- No.
They never will.
Because we are poor.
Because we cannot pay them.
That's true, isn't it?
- Maybe someday it'll be different.
- And in the meantime?
We do what we can.
And die.
There's always that.
Chris.
No matter what happens,...
.. we will never forget you, and the others.
That's all a man can ask.
If you ask me, we ought've stayed on back there and given them women a hand.
They're gonna fall behind in their plantin' and ploughin'.
So will you, Colbee. So will you.
How come you're still along, Luis?
Thought once you got clear of that firing squad, you'd head for the hills.
- So did I.
- What changed your mind?
Well, I had a long talk with myself.
I said "Luis, in all the years that I've known you,...
.. you've not done one thing for anyone but yourself. "
"Not one. And it's about time that you did. "
"Where would you be if it was not for the poor farmers you've stolen from?"
"You would be nothing.
Help these poor people,...
.. and you'll be able to ride proud, with your head high up. "
If somebody don't blow it off.
Then I would die in good company.
Hell... Chris there, he's been killin' for ten years.
Vin, about half that time.
Colbee, he hunts other men's wives between gun jobs.
ManueI's nothin' but a chicken thief.
And you?
- I'm no better than they are.
- But you're still along.
You coulda run for the hills, same as me.
I got my reason for stayin'.
And it don't have one damn thing to do with friendship,...
.. or helpin' poor farmers.
- Buenas tardes, compadre Lorca.
- Buenas tardes, compadre.
Have you seen the priest?
He was looking for you.
- Again?
- He heard about the killings.
He said we should have tried to reason with them.
Reason?
Did I build an empire upon reason?
Did we reason with renegades, bandits, corrupt officials?
But these are not renegades, nor bandits.
- Nor are they corrupt.
- You never tire of being my conscience.
"The strong must be generous to the weak. "
You know who made up that rule? The weak!
Francisco, I have to talk to you.
Two workers were killed last night.
- They were trying to escape.
- But you have no right.
Look, Father. I know your feelings for these people.
But would it be a more honourable death if they fell pulling a plough?
- The Church cannot sanction...
- Sanction? You wanted a church.
You couldn't pray it into existence so you came to me.
- You chose this place, these methods.
- For a reason.
What reason can there be for killing in cold blood, Francisco?
- You wouldn't understand.
- I understand murder, slavery.
Look, Father. I set out to rebuild this church, this village,...
.. and that is what I'm going to do, with or without your blessing.
I cannot stand by and let this go on, Francisco.
- Nothing says you have to stay.
- Everything says I have to stay.
He is right, Father.
You should leave this place.
- I can't.
- You mean you won't.
I mean I can't.
- Buenas tardes, senor.
- Buenas tardes.
What can we do for you?
A friend of mine.
You're holding him prisoner.
I want him. And all the others.
- Just like that.
- Just like that.
You are either a very stupid or a very brave man, senor.
One word from me and you would be dead.
That'll make two of us.
There are five Winchesters pointed at your head.
Professionals.
- Professionals.
- Perhaps we should have a little talk.
We just did.
- Father, you'd better get Francisco.
- Don't move, Father.
- You would kill a priest?
- Only if I have to.
Same old Chris.
I might have known you'd be along.
It's good to...
Whatever you and your men are being paid,...
.. I'll double it. I'll triple it.
- Same old Lorca.
- Come. We will talk.
- Can't do that.
- That's the only thing you can do.
You're six against 60.
Don't expect these farmers to help you.
They have no stomach to fight.
- No?
- No.
Kill him.
Go on. Kill him.
You've killed others.
- But they didn't have guns.
- They had guns three years ago...
.. when 200 men gave up their lives inside the walls of this church.
Gave up their lives to rid this country of tyranny.
Do you think it concerns these farmers...
.. that I tracked bandits across miles of desert and fought them on this ground...
.. while they hid under their straw beds?
Mis hijos.
My sons. Tall, erect, like two well-bred stallions.
They're buried here with the others.
No longer will their graves be marked by ruins.
This church, this village,...
.. will be a monument for those who fought so well.
A monument built with the sweat and blood of those who never fight.
I'll prove it to you. Lopez.
Do as he says.
- Kill him.
- Francisco!
- You stay out of this, Father.
- I have stayed out of it as long as I can.
I beg you, Francisco, before it is too late.
Before God damns you to hell for what you are doing here.
You spared my life once.
Now I'm going to save yours.
Take your vaqueros and ride out of here.
Ride out and don't look back.
I was wrong.
You're not the same old Chris.
I won't let you drown your grief in other men's blood, if that's what you mean.
Go on.
Get out.
Pues morimos, compadre.
!Muchachos! !Vamonos!
There will be a next time.
!Vamonos!
He will be back.
I know.
I swore I would never wear this again.
What a man swears and what he does isn't always the same.
It's good to see you, Chris.
Good to see you, Chico.
Is it?
Lorca has many men out there.
I've been shot at before.
But we cannot pay you to help us, Chris.
I knew a young gun once.
He was a wild, mostly drunk kid when I met him.
Turned out to be a man.
Man enough to set his gun aside, take a wife,...
.. try to amount to something.
He also turned out to be a friend.
- Worth dying for?
- If I have to.
What about the others?
They're along for the fight.
If it wasn't this one, it would be another.
Get up in the bell tower.
Watch off toward the cemetery.
If they come, it'll be from there.
And Chico.
Don't get too attached to that gun.
When this is over...
I'll throw it in the water bucket... and ride out.
I did not know it would come to this.
When Francisco lost his sons
I tried to give him consolation.
He told me he wanted to build a monument to those who had fallen.
I convinced him it should be a church.
I wanted it as much as he did.
Even more.
As God is my judge, I have tried to help these poor souls,...
.. tried for so long.
I've spoken to them of faith,...
.. of love.
They believed me.
But my words and their prayers have changed nothing for them.
The children have died,...
.. the crops have failed.
And now I have betrayed them.
I'm not a religious man, Father.
But I'll tell you this.
They need you.
More now than ever before.
I failed them.
You failed yourself.
Got knocked down.
Get up, Father.
At least as far as your knees.
That's the last of 'em. Now what?
- We movin' out tonight?
- We're not moving out at all.
Catch us in the open with 300 men on foot, we won't have a chance.
- We gonna stand it out here?
- We got cover, we got supplies.
And they have to come to us.
That cuts the odds in half.
They won't lay out there very long.
Like as not they'll try to get it over with as fast as they can.
- I wish to hell these walls were higher.
- They will be.
You and Frank split the workers in two groups.
One take the south wall, the other take the north.
Get rocks, timbers, adobe blocks, anything a man can stay alive behind,...
.. and start building.
- Now?
- Now.
The storm is over.
It's a long day's ride to the hacienda, compadre.
Would you have me run from seven guns and those farmers? Those cowards?
All we have left is the ammunition in our belts,...
.. the water in our canteens, and the food in our stomachs.
That is enough.
That is more than enough.
!Vamonos, muchachos! Adentro.
!Vamonos, muchachos! !Vamonos!
I don't know about you, but that scared the hell outta me.
- You reckon they'll hit us again?
- Just as hard as they can.
Bring me a horse!
Come on!
Are you all right, compadre?
I will make them suffer for this.
I will make them all suffer for this.
Lopez, you may ride to the hacienda.
Get every man that works for me.
Every boy old enough to carry a gun.
The farmers, the vaqueros.
Bring them all here!
But if I do that, you will have nothing to go back to.
The cattle will scatter into the hills and the crops will faiI in the fields.
All you have worked for, compadre.
AII I have worked for is buried beside that church.
My sons.
Do as I say, compadre.
Funny how your mind'll play tricks on ya.
Up there, when they was comin' at us,
I got to thinkin' they were husbands.
- Husbands?
- Ganged up on me.
Sent a shiver up my spine.
I swear, we get outta this, I ain't ever gonna look at another woman. Ever!
- Agh!
- Oh. Sorry.
Looks like they're gonna wait for night.
They hit us in the dark, it could get kinda hard to stay alive in here.
We make a run for it, we can be back at the village in two days, maybe less.
- And then what?
- Make our stand there.
What about the women and children?
Yeah.
Looks like you should have turned me in for that bounty.
About that bounty, Chris.
There never was a price on ya.
I just wanted to ride along with you for a ways.
- Well, maybe they'll back off.
- Not Lorca.
He won't let go till this is over once and for good.
You seem like you know him pretty well.
I was paid to kill him once.
Shame you didn't get the job done.
By his sons.
His sons?
He said they were tall, erect, like finely bred stallions.
They weren't.
They were gentle, like their mother.
Lorca thought they were weak.
He rode roughshod over them trying to make them over in his own image.
Their mother tried to stop him.
Died trying.
They hated him, wanted him dead.
So they hired you.
Lorca found out about it.
He could have had me killed.
Instead he gave me a horse, let me ride out.
Don't know why.
Maybe he saw in you what he never saw in his own.
Maybe.
Wonder how come the two of 'em ended here.
Knowing Lorca, he shamed them into it.
Then why is he building this church for 'em?
Not for them, Vin. For him.
He got his chance to do the one thing he could never do when they were alive.
Be proud of them.
What are they waiting for?
I wish now that Petra had never found you, Chris.
That you'd never gotten into this.
You and the others get killed, what good will it do?
Nothing will change.
No matter what happens here, nothing will change.
There'll always be someone like Lorca,...
.. someone to push men around like cattle.
I've seen enough of fear,...
.. running, hiding.
When this is over,
I'm heading north across the border.
I made my living with a gun once.
I can do it again.
What about Petra?
Man runs out on his own people, doesn't leave a wife a whole lot to be proud of.
She'll understand.
Will she?
Chief Lopez went to the hacienda.
Tomorrow he'll bring 400 guns.
If he does, this will soon be over. t- The sooner, the better.
- I agree.
You'll get that old bird drunk, you don't watch out.
No entiendo.
Tu hacer ese pajaro borracho.
Hey, hello, Chris. Uh,...
.. ManueI here, he's got somethin' he wants to tell ya.
Go on, ManueI. Tell him.
Todo este tiempo...
No, no, no. You tell him what I taught ya.
Hable en ingles.
For a long time...
No, compadre.
What he's tryin' to tell you, Chris, is that...
.. for a lotta years now he's been knockin' around from one village to another.
He ain't got no folks that he can remember.
He don't even know how old he is except he's young and, uh,...
.. he's been called ManueI ever since he was knee-high to a grasshopper.
Another thing he remembers is that he always felt kinda lost and lonely.
- But he don't no more. Know why?
- No. Why?
Because when I was out there stompin' around in the rain last night,...
.. I come across a sign with the name of the village on it. Something "DeI Norte".
- First part of it had been burned off.
- So?
So, ManueI was always lookin' for some place to come from,...
.. some place he can belong to, be proud of. Now he can.
Village ain't got no people, he ain't got no village.
- So from now on they can call him...
- ManueI from Something DeI Norte.
Yeah! It's got a nice ring to it, ain't it?
Yeah.
Uh, Chris. Um...
Anyhow, uh... Think we oughta get him outta here safe?
You know, he ain't a whole lot with a gun, and, uh,...
.. they keep comin' at us that way, he's gonna get hurt.
Maybe we could send him off somewheres.
If we did, I'd sure feeI a whole lot better.
What about him?
How'd he feeI?
Now that he's finally got something to belong to.
Yep...
Frank was right.
I talk too damn much.
It's Frank!
- You all right?
- Just a crease.
Were you tryin' to get your head blowed off?
It's my head.
You get yourself killed, it won't do anybody any good.
Depends how you look at it.
What's eatin' him?
I saw you up there on the wall this morning.
Now this.
- Why?
- None of your damn business.
Chris.
You never knew my wife, did you?
We had us a place in West Texas.
Wasn't much, just gettin' started. Had a herd to build, wire to string and such.
One night some Comanches got drunk,...
.. jumped the reservation, lit out, killin', burnin'...
We woke up, they was all around the cabin - 1 4, 1 5 of 'em.
I held 'em off as long as I could till I only had one shell left.
Ellie screamed at me not to let 'em take her alive.
She'd... seen what they'd done to others.
She kept beggin' me, beggin'...
So I...
The Comanches saw what I'd done.
I thought they'd kill me too, but they didn't. They just rode off.
Next morning I started trackin' 'em.
Killed 'em one at a time, all the while hopin' they'd kill me.
Five years, I've been tryin' to get the job done.
But it don't look like
I have to wait much longer.
I heard 'em talkin' out there.
Lorca sent for help.
Come tomorrow he's gonna have 200 guns, maybe more.
And he's not gonna settle for just us, Chris.
He wants 'em all dead.
Every last one of 'em.
Senor...
The others, they have asked me to talk to you.
They don't want you to die here because of them.
Go.
While there is still time.
They will not kill us all.
Those who are left will return to the village,...
.. begin again.
If we are strong like you...
But we are not. We are weak.
- Too weak to fight.
- You fight every day of your lives.
You fight the land to grow crops.
You fight to keep a roof over your heads, clothes on your back.
- That is not the same.
- The hell it's not.
We are cowards, senor.
We are afraid of everyone, of everything.
Our whole life is one of fear.
We are born with it.
We die with it.
It is our way. It will always be our way.
Please, senor.
We beg you.
Before it is too late.
Go... please.
You ain't thinkin' of runnin', are you, Chris?
He may be right.
I knew a fella once.
He was loud, always braggin'.
Inside he was afraid of his own shadow.
Never woulda got over it either, if this other fella hadn't come along.
I'm talkin' about that night in Texas...
.. when you made me stand alongside you in the street.
I remember you had to knock me down four times...
.. before I'd go against them guns.
We got to do the same for them, Chris.
We got to stand alongside of 'em so that someday they can stand alone.
I thought all you did was think about women, Colbee.
I used to be afraid of them too.
We ain't gonna run, are we, Chris?
Hell, no.
Orate, frates.
If you're thinkin' about goin' out there, we'd better get at it.
Those others get here, the hills are gonna get higher to climb.
How many men does he have left?
I counted 30.
We could circle high around and come at 'em from behind.
One chance in hell.
That's better than none at all.
Saddle the horses.
I already did.
Tu quedate aqui.
Ain't you gonna take him with us?
- He'll cover us from the bell tower.
- We'll need all the help we can get.
He stays behind.
- For luck?
- For luck.
- Kyrie eleison.
- Kyrie eleison.
- Kyrie eleison.
- Kyrie eleison.
Chris!
Hey! Come on!
Chris!
Keep going.
Ya! Giddap! Ya!
Chris!
!Alto el fuego! !Alto!
Vamonos.
I got it done, Chris.
I finally...
Chris.
Kill them. Kill them.
Don't stop. Kill them.
Kill them.
It was Chico's idea to finish building the church,...
.. to bring all three villages here and make them into one.
- I thought you were heading north.
- I changed my mind.
- I'm ready to go, Chico.
- Go where?
- Well, back to get the rest of the women.
- He volunteered.
- So long, Colbee.
- So long, Chris.
Too bad the others couldn't have seen this.
We'll remember them in our prayers.
- Goodbye, Chico.
- Chris.
So long, Padre, Chico.
- Adios.
- God bless you.
I'll be damned.
I doubt that.
I doubt that very much.

Unmasked!
It will be on the first page tomorrow!
Raimundo wrote the supporting editorial. He's already been denounced.
Only the revocation of his mandate is left. It's in your hands, Nestor.
Schedule a meeting for tomorrow.
I already have the whole accusation.
I'll speak with him, we'll talk, and the path is open.
Perfect, Hugo. I'll schedule it.
Promise him everything.
Indulge his opinions, but don't submit yourself to him
Make him feel this man's danger. They need to feel they've been fooled.
This is fundamental.
Be strong, Hugo, be strong!
I'll call to tell you the place and time.
FACE TO FACE
[National Economy Board]
[School]
Raul!
Forward, and back!
With the arms well stretched!
Downà Holding your breath!
Forward, and it's over! Let's go! àraise your arms, the body looking forward, and one, and two, and one, and two, and now the other side!
One, and two, and one, and two, and one, and two, and one, and twoà
And it's over! Thank you very much and see you next time!
See you soon, see you soonà
You stay here, you were late. àto your places, please.
Like this, down and up! àlet's go, we don't have time to lose.
You stay here in front of me.
Open your arms.
Now let raise our arms, really slowly, until we join them above our heads.
Carefulà
Now we go down, releasing our breath.
Like thisà
I don't want to see you anymoreà
It was your father who forbade it.
I said I would not come here anymoreà
But you did.
You think your father is right, isn't it?
We've already talked about it.
Have you thought through this whole thing? Do you know what you're doing?
Yes.
This is absurd, Lucianaà
Your father is the one who forbids you to see me!
And the reason is always the same, my future.
He thinks that what I'll do for a living, my work, that it won't give me economic safety.
And the worse is that you also believe this even after everything we've discussed.
And you don't accept change.
Well, I've already told you a million timesà
Changing is not like this.
You speak as if it's like changing a shirt, but it's different, it's my life.
So you're to blame as well.
Ah, it's my faultà
Ok, Luciana, as you wish. àwe can't wait not even a minute more!
Either we make this arrangements, or then it'll be too late!
Without the slightest doubt,
Excellency!
As you see, it's not a suspicion, it's a fact!
This project which will be presented is absurd!
What kind of crazy amendment is this?
What authorizes this man to make this front of peasants and workers?
What's his right to share government lands?
Government lands belong to the government, and only it can share what it owns!
Why doesn't he share his home and his property with these people? No!
But this is not on his project! It speaks about sharing State lands, the same State which pays him for his help.
This man is ungrateful, unworthy of holding a public post!
And more than that: he is a constant danger to the government, which should banish him immediately!
And thisà
This is now up to you!
You already have the necessary evidence.
It's no longer a secret this man's danger.
He is a constant threat, a crazy man!
- And now he needs to be quickly punished.
- That's right.
For the sake of the country!
Ok then, we'll act as quickly as possible.
I already have the necessary evidence.
Come lunch with me tomorrow, Hugo.
I'll have an answer.
All right.
My sonà
Dearà
I'm close to the end.
I lost everything!
Now only youà and the torments are left to me.
Come here.
Let me take somethingà from this hell in which I live.
"The end of the story was pronounced in Latin.
Quintanilha served as best man for the bridegroom and was godfather to the first two children
One day [à], as he was bringing some candy to his godchildren, while crossing the
15th November Square, he was hit by a stray bullet, which killed him almost instantly.
He is buried in Saint
John's Cemetery; the grave is simple, the headstone bears an epitaph that ends with this pious words:
'Pray for him!'
It's also the closure of my story.
Orestes still lives, but without the remorses of the Greek model.
Pylades is now Sophocles' mute character.
Pray for him!"
How are you?
How have you been?
Father Afonso.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Contacts have already been made.
If everything goes along as usual,
I'll very soon take my chair.
About your support, gentlemen,
I need it more than ever.
We have to be very careful so that there'll be no unpleasant surprise whatsoever.
The conditions you asked, gentlemen, I accept, but it won't be possible to negotiate them now.
The general public is alert, and any slip can easily come to light.
We need utmost prudence.
But what guarantees we have to support you?
My word!
Well, this is not allà
I have other commitments.
After all, a word is not enough.
But to this stuff, there's no other guarantee.
Either we do it under this conditions, or it will be impossible.
The main thing is to eliminate the man.
That's the only way to open our path.
We have a rope around our necks, but we can remain calm.
Only Santoro's prison can allow us to gain the leaders trust.
You can only win, can't you see?
Yes.
That's true.
I accept it.
And then?
Yes. But if things change, what's our guarantee?
After all, we're dealing with people we don't even know.
About that, don't worry.
I'm well guarded.
I have guarantees and there's no danger of a turnaround.
And, besides, you also depend on me.
If you support me, you're safe! You'll gradually get hold of the situation.
Ok, I don't see another way out.
I agree.
What about you?
Well, if there's no other way outà
Yes, there is. But I consider it unwise, since we're dealing with you.
All right.
Let's do business.
It is hereby established thisà
This is a good plan.
And, for this, they'll have to agree with my plan.
How are you, good?
Is the dress ready?
Yes. Just a little moment.
- You're not going to take the other one?
- No.
- What about this one, wanna try?
- No.
- If I find any problem, I'll be back, ok?
- Ok.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I took it today at the tailor, do you like it?
It's cute!
I copied the cut from a Jane Fonda dress which I've seen at Helio's.
Divine.
I've just got my dress for Olavinho's party.
- Is it good?
- I did not try it.
Me neither. It was delivered this morning, but I did not have time to see it.
- Has JoÒo Paulo ordered his clothes?
- Yes. He called to tell it's ready.
Great.
- Look, it's cute, isn't it?
- Beautiful! What about the hat?
It's there in the closet.
No, not that one, the other. Yesà
Ah, it's divine!
Let's do something?
Let's put on the cloths and test them, to see if they please us?
Call JoÒo Paulo, tell him to come tooà It'll be fun, right?
How crazy! It was a success!
I almost got a marriage proposalà
JoÒo Paulo has vanished!
Yes, I have not seen him anymore, in all that messà
Gone!
I think every woman who's feeling lonely should do something like that.
- I bet she'd get married!
- Or she'd get something else.
- What's going on?
- Nothing.
I'm going. Thanks. Bye!
It may be just a feeling, but it seems I've seenà
It's not the first time.
I've been always feeling this.
As if someone's been following me.
One does not see, but feelsà
This is awfulà
Nonsense. It's probably nothing.
Yes, maybe.
One must go. We have to go.
- We'll go.
- Well, this is really something, Hugo.
Funerals and weddings are for friends.
I've never heard about this man.
I'm sorry he's dead.
But to go to his funeralà
Do me a favor!
Let's leave this argument for later!
Please, Laura, let's go!
No, Hugo. Besides, they are weird, they're too reserved, they don't talkà
Terrible, you're crazy!
The price of gloryà it's just like this.
Enough, please!
And respect, Luciana!
Let's go quick, Laura, we're almost late!
On top of that we also have to be on time?
To arrive early on a funeral, this is the first time in my life.
Ah, my Godà
Dr. Hugo, phone!
- Who is it?
- Dr. Nestor.
Hello, Nestorà
What?
Great.
Excellent.
Perfect.
Yes, of course.
Is he in?
Magnificent!
I'll be there at four o'clock.
See you soon.
Ah, Lucianaà
Would you please change the day of this party of yours?
Your grandparents are coming.
Enough mess, at least for this week.
- Speaking of partyà Lurdes!
- Madam?
Will you tell JosÚ to go get the candleholders this afternoon?
The man called to say they are ready.
Bye, my daughter.
Mommy, that's some advancementà
That's all I neededà
- Bye, my daughter.
- Bye, daddy.
- Have you checked that thing for Olavinho?
- Ah, I'll check it this week.
Please, daddyà
Once more, congratulations,
Your Excellency.
Everything is set up.
Within a few days, I'll be the most recent member of the power.
Santoro's detention order should be ready in the next hours.
Don't forget your commitments, my dear.
I'll demand what was arranged, bit by bit.
Your Excellency, business are business.
Hello.
Yes.
Everything is perfect.
Santoro has just taken refuge in an embassy.

THE END
<font color=#ff00ff>[SIRENS]</font>
<font color=#ff00ff>[GUNSHOTS]</font>
<font color=#ff00ff>[HEARTBEAT]</font>
Sorry we had to got you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
I thought I was on vacation. What's it all about?
I can't tell you that.
- Where are we goin'?
- I can't tell you that either.
You're to stay inside, Mr. Grant, and wait.
<font color=#ff00ff>[WHIRRING]</font>
Your ID card, please.
Thank you.
- Hello, Grant.
- General Carter!
Good to see you again.
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General?
They wanted you in that uniform.
Come on.
Benes! What the devil happened?
The other side got to him.
- How bad off is he?
- Brain injury. He's in a coma.
- Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
- Before he could breathe a word.
He's the only scientist who knows the answer we're after.
That's why we have to operate.
And why we need you.
Me? I can't even put a Band-Aid on my finger.
Here's the surgeon. Duval.
Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
- Sorry, I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
- Cora Peterson, his technical assistant.
- You'll be joining Duval and the others.
- What can I do? Except maybe pass out.
Mike?
Yes, Alan.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, chief of the medical section.
- Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
- I wish I knew why.
Tell him where he fits in, will you?
I've got a few things to check out.
We need you for security purposes, Mr. Grant.
- At an operation?
- They know they failed to kill Benes.
Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get.
We're afraid of sabotage: surgical assassination.
Surgical assassination?
- That nean you suspect...
- Duval. That's right.
Well, I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult...
- Difficult? He's impossible.
- That's no reason to suspect his disloyalty.
Why take chance? There must be other doctors.
Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and it's no time, his eye is right here at hand.
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or to kill him.
I'll be standing by. I would know.
No matter what happend you're to take orders only from Dr. Michaels. Understand?
- Right, sir.
- Come along. They'll be operating shortly.
See you later, Mike.
His technician okay? In addition to the looks?
- Partner?
- No question of her loyalty.
- I'll take that, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
I don't mean to be inquisitive, but this CMDF.
For all I know, it could stand for
Consolidated Mobilization of... Delinquent Females.
- Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces.
- Say that again.
We can reduce anything down to any size we want. People, ships, tanks, planes.
General, I've heard some wild ones, but this takes it.
We can shrink an army, with all its equipments. Put it in a bottle cap.
That's why we call it Combined
Miniature Deterrent Forces.
<font color=#ff00ff>[WHISTLES]</font>
If the other side ever gets all of thing like that...
They have. But we both have the same problem, lack of control.
They can only keep things miniaturize for exactly 60 minutes.
After that everything starts growing back to its original size.
- I assume Benes knows how to control it.
- That's right. He wanted us to have the secret,
- not them, that's why they tried to kill him.
- They'll probably try again.
No wonder you want me to stand by at during the operation.
And take a little trip with him.
Trip? Where to?
Well, the only way we can reach that clot is from inside the brain.
So we've decided to put a surgical team and crew into a submarine, reduce it way down in size and inject it into an artery.
- You mean I'm going along?
- As part of the crew, yes.
Wait a minute. They can't shrink me.
- On miniaturizer we can shrink anything.
- Well, I don't want to be miniaturized!
- It's just for an hour.
- Not even for a minute!
General Carter, I really think you should reconsider your choice.
I just don't think I'm right kind of man...
- for this kind of job.
- Grant, you're going to a briefing.
Miss Peterson volunteered to come along.
So did every male technician in this unit. A woman has no place
- on a mission of this kind.
- I insist on taking my technician.
- You'll take along who I assign.
- Don't tell me who I'm going to work with, not on this operation or another.
I'll do what I think is best...
- without any of interference!
- Dr. Duval has relied on Miss Peterson for years.
And since she wants to come along,
- I think it's for the best, Dr. Reid.
- Well, I disagree with you.
Since you're in charge, go ahead and do as you please. But I want it on record I'm against it.
Grant, Colonel Reid, operational commander.
- How are you?
- You met our medical chief.
- This is Dr. Duval, head surgeon.
- I've heard of you, Doctor.
Miss Peterson, his technical assistant.
- How are you?
- And this is Captain Bill Owens, designer of an experimental submarine for the Navy's research and development program.
- Out of your element, aren't you, Captain?
- Sort of.
- That makes two of us.
- Grant is uniquely suited to this mission.
He's a communications expert and he was a frogman during the war.
Besides, he brought Benes into this country.
The fewer people who know about that, the better.
At any rate, you'll find Grant invaluable should anything go wrong once you're underway.
Okay, Don.
Here's the overall target area.
Doctor?
Benes's brain. As near as we can map it stereotaxically.
The clot is right here.
It's impossible to get at, without damage to the intervening tissue, which would prove fatal to Benes.
The only way to reach it is via the arterial system.
Phase one calls for miniaturizing a submarine, with crew and surgical team, and injecting it into the carotid artery.
How small will it be?
About the size of a microbe. We're putting Benes in deep hypothermia.
What?
That's freezing him as low as is compatible with human life.
It'll slow down his heartbeat, circulation and all other physical processes.
Well, even so, Colonel, because of our size...
Well, I mean, the lack of it, we'll still be cruising pretty fast.
We'll be smashed to bits if there's turbulence.
The only danger of... turbulence is in the heart and we're not going through it.
Once in the carotid artery, we remain within the arterial system until we reach the point of the damage, where Dr. Duval will attempt to dissolve the clot with a laser beam.
Ehm...
Thank you.
After the operation, we return by way of the venous system until we reach the base of the neck, where we'll be removed right here. With a hypodermic.
How will you know where the sub is at any particular moment?
Dr. Michaels is a circulatory specialist and will act as your navigator.
He'll know just where you are and you can communicate directly with us by wireless.
Beside that, the sub is nuclear powered.
We will track it just as we would any radioactive tracer.
There'll be a team of surgeons standing by, they be prepare to remove you immediately should anything happen.
In any event, you must be out within 60 minutes.
- After that, you're in danger of attack.
- Attack? Who? Or should I say what from?
- Benes's natural defenses.
- Oh, white corpuscles, antibodies.
You see, once you begin to grow, you become a menace to the body and you'll trigger them off.
And there may be other, unknown, factors.
- We can't be certain of anything.
- Any further questions? Anybody?
- Just one, General.
- Yes what's that?
Where do I get a cab back to town?
Dr. Michaels, I think you better proceed to the
- sterilization section.
- Yes, sir.
Will you follow me?
How much can a man give to his country?
Your attention, please.
Make the final preparations.
Heart.
How's it look, Henry?
Holding steady. 32 per minute.
Respiration.
Jack, what's the report?
Respiration is down to six a minute.
I wouldn't take him down any further.
Hypothermia.
Any problems, Dr. Sawyer?
No, sir. We're holding him at 28 degrees Centigrade.
- How do we stand?
- Particle's ready.
Colonel, they're now entering the sterilization corridor, sir.
<font color=#ff00ff>[MACHINERY HUMS]</font>
<font color=#FF551>CARTER:</font> Please board and check all your equipment immediately.
Here's the particle, sir.
- Everything aboard?
- All squared away, sir.
Dr. Michaels.
- Yes?
- Here's your chart table right here.
Here's all the maps and charts are in sequence from left to right.
- And... and... here's your checklist.
- All right, uh...
- Dr. Duval and I will just check the charts.
- Fine. Mr. Grant?
- This is your wireless station right here.
- Oh, good.
- Check!
<font color=#FF551>- DUVAL:</font> Ocular motor nerve.
<font color=#FF551>- MICHAELS:</font> I see.
<font color=#FF551>- DUVAL:</font> Brain?
No!
- Need any help, skipper?
- Oh, yeah. We'll save some time, Mr. Grant.
Open this thing for me, would you?
- Ok.
- Set it down there.
- Where? On the deck here?
- Yeah, right there.
- That's radioactive material.
- It's atomic fuel.
- Is it all right to open it?
- Oh, it's perfectly safe.
There's a... microscopic radioactive particle inside.
Nothing big enough to be
- seen with the naked eye.
- Here?
Yeah, that's it.
If it's no military secret, how can a sub run on a microscopic particle?
Well, they can't reduce nuclear fuel.
But once the reactor's been miniaturized along with submarin, a microscopic particle should put out enough energy to activate it.
- That's cutting it mighty close for a perfect fit.
- Well, it should work, theoretically.
If it doesn't, the whole mission's off.
You see, this craft is just nuclear powered. All except for your wireless.
All in all, quite a canoe.
Designed for piscatorial research: uh... spawning habits of deep-sea fish.
That reminds me, I'd better spawn a radio message.
Test message from the Proteus, sir: "Miss Peterson has smiled".
Well, that's an auspicious sign. Confirm receiving.
- Uh... Captain?
- Hum?
How will you be able to follow my charts from up there?
Well, there's no power on right now, but once there is... uh...
May I have this chart, please?
You just, uh... place chart right here and it will come through on that repeater.
- Repeater?
- Yeah, the devi...
Come on, I'll show you.
- There, that's it.
- Oh, yes.
It... all seems quite simple to operate.
Well, actually, it is, although the controls are highly sophisticated.
Look here.
There's a button, and a switch, for everything.
Bet you're pretty handy around the house.
Can you cook?
We're pushing oxygen today.
- I'll have some laughing gas, Mom.
- It sound you're not looking forward to it?
It's not exactly a pleasure cruise, you know.
I think it's very exciting.
We're going to see things no one has ever seen before.
Not just something under a microscope.
- Think about it.
- That's the trouble, I am.
- Being shrunk!
- You may learn to like it.
Excuse me.
For a nice young lady, you play with the damnedest toys, Miss Peterson.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.
Now I know.
That could be quite a lethal weapon. It could kill, not cure.
Not in the hands of a great surgeon like Dr. Duval.
The beam from this laser can be regulated to one millionth of a millimeter.
I understand, you've been Dr. Duval's assistant for quite some time.
- He must have snatched you out of a cradle!
- I've been with him since I got out of school.
He brought me into the CMDF over five years ago.
- That's a long time with one man.
- Not working with someone like Dr. Duval.
He's...
- Well...
<font color=#ff00ff>- [WIRELESS BLEEPS]</font>
- Prepare for miniaturization.
- Positions, please.
- I tell, I still have something to check.
- Right. Mr. Grant?
There are two seats under the chart table. Would you pull them out, please?
Secure your safety belts.
Ah, Miss Peterson, this is your chair right here.
- Doctor, let me help you.
- No, no, no, it's all right. I can manage.
- Doctor?
- Yes, Cora.
- I, um... well, I wanted to say that...
- What is it? Is anything wrong?
No, nothing. I... just wanted to say thank you for taking me along.
Thank you for volunteering.
Right, Mr. Grant. You can tell them the Proteus is ready.
- The Proteus? What's that?
- It's the name of this vessel.
Sounds better than calling it the U-91035.
<font color=#ff00ff>- [WIRELESS BLEEPS]</font>
- Proteus reports all secured, sir.
- Miniaturizer.

It's too late for that.
Now, we must go on.
I'm sorry. I... I've got claustrophobia. I was...
I was buried alive... in an air raid in England.
Two days.
I... thought I'd got over it.
Please forgive me.

The medieval philosophers were right.
Man is the center of the universe.
We stand in the middle of infinity, between outer and inner space.
And there's no limit to either.
I never imagined it could be anything like this.
- No, I always thought it was nothing but red.
- Only to the naked eye.
Those corpuscles carrying oxygen give the stream its color.
The rest of the plasma's very much like sea water.
- An ocean of life.
- End to end, 100,000 miles long.
- Dr. Duval?
- Hmm?
What could those be?
Then, that looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
I don't agree.
- I think we should stop and investigate.
- No, I'm afraid we haven't time.
Captain, keep your present heading until we're in the clear.
Arterial wall to the left.
- Uh... what's our speed?
- 15 knots.
You should reach the main branching artery in two minutes.
Keep the wall at present distance when you turn, that should bring you safely into the middle of the branch.
Right.
- Captain, correct your course and speed!
- She won't respond.
We're in a some kind of current.
- Well, that isn't possible.
- Not in a sealed vessel like an artery.
There's something wrong with your controls.
No, it's a current. It's too strong.
I can't seem to break out of it.
Whirlpool! Strap yourselves in.
Anyone hurt?
Cora?
I'm all right. Thank you, Doctor.
Where are we?
The corpuscles are blue.
Captain, what's your compass heading?
<font color=#ff00ff>[BELL]</font>
Proteus off course.
They've... they've crossed over into the jugular vein!
That can't be. There's no direct connection between the two.
Well, normally not.
Unless there's an arteriovenous fistula.
A what?
It's a... a forced joining of a vein and an artery.
It must have happened when Benes was hurt.
Yes, a fistula too small to show up in the tests.
- But big enough for us.
- Can you head back into the artery?
No, we can't fight that current.
That's physically impossible.
Well, try not to drift down any further.
I'll do what I can.
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
Well, we can go forward on this course but...
That means going directly through the heart.
No, no, we can't do that either. Remember we decided in the briefing.
This craft could never stand the turbulence.
Yes, it would be a hundred times worse than the whirlpool.
That's just dandy! We can't go forward and we can't go back.
There's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
<font color=#FF551>REID:</font> Well, we've no choice.
We've got to take them out.
No. We've still got 51 minutes. Leave 'em in.
But it's hopeless. They can't go back and they can't go on.
I'll tell you, there's nothing else we can do but to remove them.
Not until the very last second. We gotta think of something, something to save the situation.
Proteus reports trapped in venous system. Requests removal, sir.
Well, there it is.
What do I tell them, General?
Doctor...
Without killing him, how long could we stop his heart?
- Well, the less time the better.
- I know, I know, but what's the maximum?
Well, in his comatose state and everything slowed down... no more than 60 seconds.
At top speed, adjusting distance for degree of miniaturization... that sub should get through the heart in exactly 57 seconds.
That give us only three seconds to revive him.
What are the problems involved in stopping the heart?
Nothing compared with starting it up again.
We're wasting time, Colonel. Let's get on with it.
Message to Proteus.
- Cardiac red alert.
- Maintaining maximum speed, the sub should get through the heart in 57 seconds.
This will allow us three seconds to spare in which to revive him.
In order, to minimize the turbulence we will have to arrest the heart.
Prepare for cardiac shock. Remove the radar.
The Proteus will proceed to the entrance of the right atrium, at which point the heart will be stopped, by electric shock.
57 seconds.
- And if it takes longer for us to get through?
- We can't take a second more.
Captain, head in the direction of the flow and then drift with it.
Well, that looks pretty complicated.
Well, I shall be able to guide you once we're inside.
Okay.
Ready for cardiac shock.
Cardioscope.
Tracking.
<font color=#ff00ff>[FAINT THUMPING]</font>
<font color=#FF551>CORA:</font> Listen! The heart.
- Yes. It's slowed down a great deal.
- Sounds like heavy artillery.
It lays down quite a barrage.
Over 40 million beats in a year.
And every beat separates a man from eternity.
- Stand by.
- Stand by.
<font color=#ff00ff>[HEARTBEAT LOUDER]</font>
They're about to stop the heart!
Full power when we enter the valve!
<font color=#ff00ff>[TRACKER BEEPS]</font>
Hit it!
<font color=#ff00ff>[BUZZER]</font>
24 seconds left. Including three to revive him.
19 seconds, Doctor.
The semilunar valve should be on our left any second now.
Stand by to revive.
- There it is!
- Bear to your left!
- Can you see it, Captain?
- Yes. I see it now.
Brace yourselves. There'll be a tremendous surge when the heart starts up again.
If it does.
Eight seconds left.
Now!
<font color=#ff00ff>[HEARTBEAT BOOMS]</font>
They're in the pulmonary artery.
Well, they'll make up time once they get through that and reach the pleural cavity.
Respiration post.
- What's his rate, Jack?
- Back to six per minute.
Dammit! I just had them cleaned.
<font color=#FF551>DUVAL:</font> They all lead to the same place:
the lungs.
Dr. Michaels, the channel is getting awfully narrow.
Yes, we're entering a capillary.
Try to stay in the middle.
The wall's transparent.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Doctor, just think of it.
We're the first ones to actually see it happen.
The living process.
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
Oh, it's... just a simple exchange, Mr. Grant.
Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide
in return for oxygen coming through on the other side.
- Don't tell me they're refueling!
- Oxygenation.
We've known it exists even though we never saw it.
Like the structure of the atom.
But to actually see one of the miracles of the universe, the engineering of the cycle of a breath.
Well, I wouldn't call it a miracle.
Just an interchange of gases.
The end product of 500 million years of evolution.
You can't believe all that is accidental? That there isn't a creative intelligence at work?
- Well, the creative...
<font color=#ff00ff>- [ALARM]</font>
- Mr. Grant?
- What is it, skipper?
I'm losing pressure in the flotation tanks.
Would you check the manual control panel. It's aft on the starboard side.
Oh, all right.
The left tank's losing pressure.
There must be a short in the electrical valve circuit system.
Yeah.
That takes care of the valves. I suppose it happened because of that electric shock.
- Is there any damage?
- Not to the valve.
But we've lost so much air we can't make it the rest of the way.
What do you propose to do, Captain?
There's nothing we can do. We can't continue without full tanks.
- Any reserve air?
- Enough to breathe, but that's all. Excuse me.
Just a few cells away from a vast air chamber, one of the countless alveoli of the lung, and we can't get enough air to fill a microscopic tank!
Maybe we can.
- Skipper, is there a snorkel on this sub?
- Yes, there is.
Could I run a tube through that wall without harming Benes?
Poor at our present size, I should think so, certainly.
If those corpuscles can take on air, there's no reason why we can't.
All we have to do is... hook up the snorkel to that air chamber, you been talking about and when Benes inhales there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.
Yes.
- How's that sound to you, skipper?
- Well, it's a dangerous procedure.
If I miss the timing we could explode the air tanks, but...
I'm willing to try it.
I think we should.
Yes, of course. We must try it.
One more thing. It'll be safer if everybody leaves the sub but me.
I'll get the equipment.
Cora?
- Looks you didn't fasten it down too well.
- But I did!
- I'm positive.
- Then how come it worked loose?
I've no idea.
How badly is it damaged?
I don't know, Doctor. We'll have to test it.
That'll have to wait until after we're refueled.
I can't imagine how it possibaly could have happened.
I distinctly remember fastening it down.
Must've been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
Better get these on as quickly as possible.
They've stopped on the outer limits of the left lung.
Another delay, with only 42 minutes left.
Well, it'll be close but there's still a margin of safety.
Let's find out what the devil's holding them up. Contact the Proteus.
Must be some kind of mechanical difficulty.
- I thought I told you to cut down on the sugar.
- Uh?
Oh, I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
<font color=#ff00ff>[WIRELESS BLEEPS]</font>
- Shouldn't you answer that?
- Not now. We need air, not greetings, come on.
Now remember, be sure to secure the bottom hatch once you're outside.
Right.
<font color=#ff00ff>[WIND HOWLS]</font>
<font color=#FF551>GRANT:</font> It's full of rocks.
<font color=#FF551>MICHAELS:</font> That's impurities embedded in the lung.

<font color=#FF551>GRANT:</font> We'd better get on with it.
<font color=#FF551>MICHAELS:</font> Careful! There's a tremendous air pressure in there... in relation to our size.
<font color=#ff00ff>[WIND]</font>
<font color=#FF551>GRANT:</font> I'll try to hold her from the other side of the wall. Maybe that will do it.
- Tie my safety line to the sub.
<font color=#FF551>- DUVAL:</font> Here. Let me have it.
<font color=#FF551>GRANT:</font> All right, now. Push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
<font color=#FF551>MICHAELS:</font> Wait for the lull, between the time he inhales and exhales.
<font color=#FF551>MICHAELS:</font> Now!
<font color=#ff00ff>[WIND HOWLS]</font>
Full.
<font color=#FF551>CORA:</font> He's gone!
<font color=#FF551>DUVAL:</font> What can we do?
"Delay caused by stop to refuel air."
"Proceeding... through pleural... cavity."
"Refuel air"?
Why not? They had a choice of over a billion alveoli.
And a broken trigger wire.
A smashed transistor.
No way to fire the lamp.
Well, that's the end of the laser.
- You must carry spare parts.
- Nothing that's built into the chassis.
- If it only hadn't come loose!
- That's beside the point now.
Isn't there another surgical procedure you could try?
No. No, there's no other way.
I rather don't see the sense in going on with this.
- But we must!
- With no laser?
If you had a transistor about this size and power output and a thin enough wire, could you get this together?
Yes, but it requires absolute precision.
A surgeon might.
Yes. Yes, I could do it.
Well, if I had the parts!
I've got a source. All we have to do is tap it.
Grant, just a minute. You're surely not going to dismantle the wireless?
It's just one transistor and a circuit wire, that's all take.
That will knock out our communications.
We'll be cutting ourselves off the outside.
They'd still be able to track us by radar because of the radioactive fuel.
What's it to be? The wireless or Benes's life?
Send a message to the control tower.
<font color=#ff00ff>[WIRELESS BLEEPS]</font>
Message from the Proteus, sir.
"Cannibalising wireless to repair laser."
- They're what?
-"This is our last message."
Incommunicado!
Now they're really on their own.
Well, we can track 'em, but that's all we can do.
Something told me I got into the wrong end of this business.
Inner space...
The transistor will do, but the wire is much too thick.
- There's nothing closer.
- Let me see.
I might be able to scrape it thin enough.
Cora, would you bring me a number 11 scalpel, please?
Yes, Doctor.
Looks like the sea at dawn.
We're safe as long as it remains that color.
We're in the pleural sac.
It keeps the lungs from rubbing against the wall of the chest. Up there.
When those membranes become inflamed we get nothing but pleurisy and a racking cough.
Cough? Whew! If he can kick up a storm by just breathing...
Oh, his pleura's in fine condition.
- Should be plain sailing from here on.
- Let's hope so.
So far, someone's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
Sabotage?
I don't... quite understand.
I saw the laser just before we started.
It was fastened down securely.
You don't supposed what happened was an accident.
Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub.
- Surely you don't say this is suspect Duval.
- That line was tampered with.
Oh, I don't know what to say.
Well, I... I know he's under a cloud, but...
There's not a more dedicated man in entire medical profession.
We still never know what going on anyone's mind.
I don't believe it. What happend was an accident.
- Two in a row?
- It's possible.
Look at those walls up ahead.
We're entering the lymphatic system.
Those are nuclei of cells lining a duct.
I always had an idea there was only one system: the circulatory.
The lymphatic system drains off excess fluid from the tissues.
Without it, we'd all blow up like balloons.
- Looks like quite a navigation problem.
- Only until we get through the nodes.
Uh, the... lymphatic glands.
- Keep your present compass heading.
- Right.
Skipper, we're picking up seaweed, or whatever that is.
Reticular fibers. We ought to be clear of them soon.
Well, I hope so, Doctor.
Because if that stuff clogs the vents, the engines will overheat.
<font color=#ff00ff>[THUD]</font>
What's causing all this?
- Looks like somebody declared war.
- That's exactly what it is.
Antibodies destroying bacteria or any other foreign invader that threatens the system.
Look! It's taken on its exact shape.
- It's like hand in glove.
- Much closer. Like two atoms.
We'll never get there in time at this rate.
Isn't there another route so we could bypass all this?
- No.
- Yes!
- There's no other suitable route.
- Yes, there is.
We can transfer to the inner ear.
- Yes, ear.
- And go by way of the endolymphatic duct.
- But why don't we take it?
- Because it's definitely more hazardous than the route we're following now.
You see, once in the ear, any noise at all in the operating theater would be disastrous.
At our reduced size, any vibrations inside the ear would have a shattering effect.
Well, they're tracking us top side.
Once they see where we're going I'm sure they'll take every precautions.
All right. Let's hope they realize the danger.
Captain, I'll give you a new heading.
Proteus turning, in quadrant 7-3.
Finally. They're heading for the inner ear.
About time they realized they'd never make it the other way.
Your attention, please. Proteus is about to enter the inner ear.
You are not to walk, talk, or make a sound of any kind.
Absolute silence must be maintained until they are out of the danger area.
- What's wrong, skipper?
- Just what I was afraid would happen.
That stuff we passed through...
- that looks like seaweed?
- Yes, reticular fibers.
Hoom... well, it clogged the intake vents.
We're not getting any propulsion.
- Well, there's only one thing to do.
- What?
I'll see if maybe there's some way I can clear those vents.
How long do you think it'll take?
Quite some time.
- Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
- You're quite right.
We haven't a minute to spare.
- Would you, er...
- Oh, yes.
I'll stay behind.
I'd better use the time to finish repairing the laser.
<font color=#FF551>GRANT:</font> Why don't you start on the engines?
Report no movement of the Proteus since entering quadrant 7-4 at level D.
24 minutes left, maximum.
This is just what we need. Another delay.
You'll wind up a Hindu.
They respect all forms of life, however small.
<font color=#ff00ff>[ECHOING CLANG]</font>

There she is!
<font color=#FF551>MICHAELS:</font> She's damaging those fibers.

<font color=#FF551>MICHAELS:</font> Grant? The pressure. I...
- I can't...
- Get back to the sub. I'll get her out.
<font color=#FF551>CORA:</font> Hurry!
- Where are they?
- They're below the cells of Hensen.
If the antibodies reach her, they'll attack as if she were bacteria.
<font color=#FF551>- CORA:</font> Open it! Open it, before they get here!

<font color=#ff00ff>[GASPS]</font>
It's all right, Cora. Shh. It's all right.
They're on their way again.
12 minutes left.
What a time to run out of sugar.
Looks like quite a way to go.
We'll sure reach the base of the brain shortly.
From there it's not far to the site of the injury.
But we're running out of time.
Where's that light coming from?
It's from the outside world. Filtering in through Benes's eardrum.
That puts us right here. Which means we can head for the subarachnoid cavity.
The Proteus has passed the inner ear and is now in the channel leading to the brain.
<font color=#FF551>TECHNICIAN:</font> I thought I'd die when the scissors dropped on the floor!
That's a sleep!
- It's against my better judgment.
- Better judgment?
To wait until actual operation when it to may be too late?
- I've done all I could with the laser!
- All I asking is...
I'm only asking him that he test it beforehand.
If it doesn't work, it's beyond my power to fix it.
But if it does work, there's no telling how long it'll stand up.
It's a jury-rig at best and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it.
That's why I don't want to put extra strain on the connections
- by running unnecessary tests!
- Dr. Duval,
- I insist that you test the laser.
- I'll do nothing of the sort!
The operation is my responsibility.
- I won't do it and that's final.
- All right, as usual, you want it your own way.
- Only this time there's more at stake.
- I know perfectly well, what's at stake, Dr. Michaels.
Imagine! They're in the human mind.
"Yet all the suns that light the corridors of the universe
"shine dim before the blazing of a single thought...
"...proclaiming an incandescent glory: the myriad mind of Man."
Quite poetic, gentlemen. Let me know when we pass the soul.
The soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend infinity and the soul, which comes from God, is infinite.
Yes, but our time isn't.
- If my calculations are correct...
<font color=#FF551>- OWENS:</font> Doctor, what's that up ahead?
That's it! That's the site of the injury, that dark spot.
- We'd better get prepared.
- There just isn't time.
I don't see how you could possibley operate and get out of here before the hour's up.
Captain, you better head for the removal point.
- Removal point? What are you talking about?
- Well, we gonna six minutes left.
- We just barely maked.
- Hold it, skipper.
- What happens if we overstay?
- Once time's up, deminiaturization begins.
Then, within natural seconds, this ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the system.
Then, white corpuscles will swallow to destroy it as they would any other invader.
Skipper, how long will it take to get us from here to the removal point?
About two minutes.
That still leaves me four minutes to operate.
All you'll succeed in doing is getting us trapped.
I simply won't hear of it.
Captain, return immediately to the removal point.
All right.
Grant, what are you doing? My power's gone.
Dr. Duval, get the laser.
Grant, I'm in charge in this mission.
You were instructed to take orders for me, not to give them.
- I'm sorry, the situation has changed.
- Nothing's change, so far as my authority goes!
We've got to get out of here now!
It's sure suicide for all of us. I'm not going to let him operate!
Dr. Michaels, you're in no condition to make any decision.
Duval, you're not going through with this. I absolutely forbid it.
I won't allow you or anyone else
- to leave this ship!
- I'm going to do all I can to save Benes.
You're fool, don't you see what you've done?
You've given him a perfect opportunity to kill Benes.
I don't believe that.
Why not, because of all his gibberish about God and the soul?
Camouflage, that's all that is, to blind the gullible vacuum and cover up his real identity.
A fanatic whose only purpose is to kill
Benes! And now you've made it possible.
I've come up against fanatics before and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.
Skipper, I'm going out there as if they need to help.
<font color=#FF551>OWENS:</font> Remember, we need at least two minutes to get out.
How does it look, Doctor?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
Doctor, we've had it.
If I can clear this central nerve, that may be enough.
Captain, there's something wrong with the escape hatch.
What do you mean?
Uh, fluid is seeping through. I think you better have a look at it.
- Fluid? There shouldn't be any fluid...
- Yes, it is, you'll see it underneath the door.
That should do it.
<font color=#FF551>CORA:</font> Look!
<font color=#FF551>- CORA:</font> It's heading for the nerve!
<font color=#FF551>- DUVAL:</font> I don't understand.
The laser. Let me have the laser!
Give me your widest beam.
Full power.
The ship's finished.
We'll have to get out on our own. Is there a quick way out?
<font color=#FF551>- DUVAL:</font> What about Dr. Michaels?
<font color=#FF551>- CORA:</font> White corpuscles!
<font color=#FF551>DUVAL:</font> We've got to get them out. They'll ingest the ship and every thing in it.
<font color=#FF551>GRANT:</font> Stay here, both of you.
Hold them off if you can.
- What happened?
- Dr. Michaels... went berserk.
- Berserk, nothing!
<font color=#FF551>- MICHAELS:</font> Get me out of here!
Get this on, quick. If a window blows we'll lose this airlock.
<font color=#FF551>MICHAELS:</font> Grant, help! I'm trapped! Help me!
Grant... I can't get my...
I can't get my hands out. Get me out of here. I...
My hands are trapped.
I can't move... can't move my hands.
I can't move my... move my hands.
I can't move my hands. Get me out! Get me out of here!
Get me out! Get me out!
Come on, it's no use!
- That's the end of the laser.
<font color=#FF551>- GRANT:</font> You set, was the quick way out?
We could follow the optic nerve to the corner of the eye.
Time's up. We'll have to take them out immediately.
It means killing Benes. For all we know, they may have completed the operation.
Damn it to hell!
Attention, please! You will remove the Proteus immediately.
Remove the radar.
Prepare for trephination.
<font color=#FF551>DUVAL:</font> Light impulses. On the way to the brain.
We're nearing the eye.
Hold it, Doctor!
What is it?
That blip we're picking up might only be a radioactive particle.
The Proteus may already be destroyed.
What are you getting at?
If I were in their place, running out of time...
I'd abandon ship before I grew to dangerous size and use the extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible.
On my own.
Along the optic nerve to the eye.
Wait 30 seconds.
Glass slide, quick!
Open that door, please!
All right, get them!
Damned Indian.
He's still on ourt rail.
Stupid, you're simply wasting your fire.
Go ahead, Jim.
You know what to do.
Go over that way.
Why didn't you let me handle it?
One shot and I'd have finished him off.
By this time I'd already be bringing you back his scalp.
Maybe he would've had yours.
You're just too stupid.
You're real smart, brother, aren't you?
Just like a true half-breed.
Be careful, brother.
I won't ever let anyone call me a bastard.
Hey, look over there!
Look at that, Duncan.
They got a price on your head, your brother's too.
Dirty cowards.
We come to sell scalps and that's the welcome we get.
Yeah, they're crazy.
The sheriff must have made a mistake.
Yeah, well then, we'll just have to set him straight.
Two hundred, Jeffrey, that's more... than you're worth.
Hey, don't throw it away, Duncan.
We'll set fire to the whole town with that piece of paper.
We're gonna have a little fun.
They're really gonna pay for this.
We'll show them all right, won't we boys?
Come on.
Hey, one minute there.
No, no. You got to check your guns first!
You must be joking, with all those tough characters in there.
Hey, mister, don't get excited. You can keep us as hostages.
-What good will that do?
-Plenty.
If you pull up a couple of chairs for us... then we can keep you company, huh?
You wouldn't want to keep us standing here, would you?
All right. I'll get a few chairs.
Thank you.
No, afteryou.
What's going on?
Well, come on, boys.
This friendly little visit isn't over yet.
I have an idea.
We'll have to give this town a reason for collecting that reward.
We didn't do it. It was the sheriff's idea.
The sheriff, huh? Where is he?
I'd like to speak to him.
I'm right over here, Duncan.
What do you think you're doing?
Just why have you come here?
You know damn well.
We've been bringing you lndian scalps for years.
You paid us good then, Sheriff.
That ain't against the law.
What's happened?
Those days are through.
The scalps you brought then were those of troublemakers.
Now you're attacking peaceful tribes, killing... even the women and the children.
This is murder, Duncan, and
I must forbid it.
All lndians are the same to me, a bunch of red bastards.
Show him the scalps, Monkey.
Here.
And there's more where these came from.
Now, listen to me, Duncan.
I've warned you.
No sale! Just come along with us.
Duncan, I'm arresting you for murder.
Get up!
Go open up the jail, Sheriff.
Nice shot!
Your boys are in top form, my friend.
Well, well. Look who's here.
You've changed since you were in that rotten prison.
And you, you haven't changed at all, Duncan.
You're still selling out cheap.
Still satisfied with a dollar a scalp, like before.
It's a personal hobby.
And what about you?
You still make a living out of saving helpless women?
No. I'm also a doctor, remember?
And now I've gotten started in... banking.
Banking?
The name Blackwood mean anything to you?
Sure.
They're rich. The ones that own the bank in town.
But I don't think they mean anything to you.
They mean a great deal.
Blackwood's a banker and I've married his daughter.
You don't say?
I'm pretty influential now.
How about putting me on the payroll, amigo?
Well, I just might have an opening for a teller.
Look, I have a proposition that might interest you.
There's a train due to arrive in Esperanza... with half a million dollars on board.
All you have to do is hold up the train.
When the job is done, both of us will be rich.
Or I'd be rich alone.
No, don't count on it.
You can't do it without me, my friend.
That money is locked up in an armored safe. lf you're thinking of using dynamite charges,... you'd blow up the safe, all right, and the money along with it.
But I know the combination on the lock,... so I could open it nice and easy.
Hold up that train and then meet me at Hot Springs.
I'll be there tomorrow.
You won't have to run around chasing these stinking lndians anymore, just for a few lousy dollars.
And I'll be able to get the hell out of this miserable town and head back to Europe.
You must really be in love with your wife.
Of course I am.
It's easy to love a woman who's such a solid investment.
But as far as the pleasures of matrimony are concerned, well, that's another story.
-That's it.
-Come on!
Let them fight!
Come on!
Come on, girls. Hurry up!
Get up there!
Don't let those girls get away.
Larry, stop them!
-Right, Duncan.
-Make it fast.
You boys come with me.
Hey, boys, let's go! Get on those horses.
We got to stop them.
Don't let those girls get away!
Duncan, wait. That lndian!
He got two more of our men.
Come on, we'll finish him off this time.
Later. We've got something else to take care of now.
Geraldine's been hit!
You saved our lives, mister.
We're very grateful.
Don't think that we'll forget what you've done for us.
I didn't kill them for you.
Listen, mister, in Pyote, we overheard
Duncan and a man from Esperanza... gabbing about some train robbery they're setting up.
Geraldine could recognize the other fellow,... but they shot her.
It's the train that passes through Esperanza.
They've about half a million dollars... onboard in one of the cars.
The bandits have arranged to meet back in Hot Springs.
There's still time to stop that train.
Here. There's a chance you can help.
I don't know. Just why do I have to take that chance?
It's a long ways to ride.
Maybe I'll go back.
Now, get to Esperanza.
Let's go!
We've got to get back to a doctor.
She's bleeding a lot.
Dear, dear. Hush.
I know I'm going to love this country.
How beautiful the mountains are.
Do you think he'll like it, too? I'll let... the little fellow have a look.
I'm sure he'll love it here.
-King!
-Jack!
I'm through.
You've cleaned me out.
Never mind that.
You can help yourself from that safe inside.
-It's your turn.
-That's yours, Bill.
Stop! Stop the train!
-What for?
-Logs! They're blocking the track!
Brake, damn it! Brake!
-Give me a hand.
-Hold on, I'm coming.
Look at that.
That was a close one.
Hey, give me a hand here.
-What happened?
-Can't you see for yourself?
-Watch out.
-What did we stop for?
There's some logs on the tracks.
We have to clear them off.
Oh, it's all right.
Robledo, halt!
Well, looks as though the man wasn't lying.
You can smell those dollars.
Now all we gotta do is wait for our friend.
Search all the carriages. Make sure we got everybody.
Cover the other side.
Don't cry. Don't cry.
No!
We said no witnesses, remember?
You boys better decide what to do with the kid.
-Everything's quiet so far.
-Good.
Change the guard every two hours.
-You understand?
-Right.
I'm gonna go on a drunk for a month... with my cut of the money.
I'm gonna buy me a ranch and breed me some horses.
Well, there's no sense speculating now.
We can make our plans when our friend comes tomorrow.
Just tell me one thing. Why do we have to wait around?
Why couldn't he come and open the safe tonight?
It'd be too risky.
He's too well known around here.
He has to have an alibi.
Just shut up and go to sleep!
Hey, you got a match?
What's the matter?
Yeah, hey, listen a minute.
Could you please tell us where we could find a doctor?
Dr. Lynne's at the station with the others.
Then please take us to the station.
Citizens of Esperanza, we have assembled here to welcome a very special train that will be... arriving with its precious load.
I hope you know how precious.
You're all quite aware what it means to us all to receive this grant of $500,000 from our state.
This gift offers all of us definite advantages.
And all this will mean a great deal to our town.
And may we now acknowledge the efforts of our distinguished mayor,
Mr. Jefferson Clay,... to whom we sincerely offer our thanks, and we are also very grateful to
Sheriffs Reagan and Johnson for their aid.
Our appreciation also goes to the manager of our local bank,
Mr. Oliver Blackwood, and to his daughter, Hannah, beloved wife of our very competent and highly esteemed Dr. Lynne.
Whoa! Whoa, there!
Hurry. Help me, Maria!
-Gently.
-Easy now.
Be careful.
And we are very proud of all you've done.
Reverend Rattigan!
What's the matter, Estella?
We need the doctor now! A girI's been wounded.
-Let them through.
-Oh, the poor girl.
-Clear the way.
-What happened?
Put her in that room.
-Yes.
-Hannah, get my bag, quickly.
You find it, Estella. He put it in the carriage out front.
I can hardly believe what I saw.
Those men are ruthless.
First, they terrorized Pyote, then they tried to kill us.
Now calm down.
You're in no danger here.
The train will get here in a little while with an armed escort.
The soldiers will defend us.
Don't worry about Geraldine.
There couldn't be a better man than Dr. Lynne.
Let's pray there's still time to save her, poor child.
Hemostat.
But who was this other man?
I don't know. From where I was hiding it was impossible to see his face.
Geraldine's the only one of us that managed to get a good look at him.
She could recognize him.
Oh, no, it's you.
The man I saw in the saloon.
Oh, you...
No!
It's too late.
Let's go now.
Geraldine.
Hey, there's nobody on the train.
Who's that?
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Answer me!
Who are you?
I brought you a train.
Yes. Yes, but why? What happened?
It's already cost many lives.
To try and save your lives, I had to take the train.
Duncan's riding here.
With all of his men.
Wait.
How did you get it?
By stealing the train.
I told you.
Where is the money?
There, the train.
Come on, we'll make sure.
The safe should be in here.
Easy.
I'll open it.
Looks all right so far.
It's all here.
Then we should take it to the bank as quickly as possible.
Well, it looks as though that man was telling the truth. lf Duncan comes after that money, we don't stand a chance.
I don't think he'd dare come here.
And besides, there's the telegraph if we need assistance.
Mr. Clay! Mr. Clay!
Somebody's cut the telegraph wires.
The line went dead, just as I was receiving a message from Wellington.
They reported that Duncan and his men completely... destroyed the town of Pyote.
We gotta do something quickly... or those bandits are going to do the same to us.
Well, what can we do?
You realize now it's impossible to call for any help.
But we can't just wait around until those bandits ride in and kill us.
You've got to organize some sort of defense, Sheriff.
There doesn't seem to be much we can do, Mrs. Lynne.
You know perfectly well we're not equipped to stop Duncan and his gang.
We here in Esperanza, thank God, are a peaceful community.
There's not a gun in town.
We're totally helpless.
You shouldn't give up so easily.
There's one way to get rid of your problem.
What?
Kill him.
Sure. Why didn't we think of that?
This is no time to be making jokes.
Who do you suppose would be able to kill that renegade?
Me.
For a price.
We don't make bargains with lndians.
He's crazy.
Come on, we're wasting time just listening to him.
But we still haven't decided what to do.
Enough of this ridiculous talk.
Let's get that money out of here.
-And take it down to the bank.
-Just a minute.
This young man has just said that he is willing to help us out.
It hardly seems that we're in any position to refuse his proposal.
What are your terms?
I want a dollar a head from every man in this town... for every bandit I kill.
Plus the reward that's been offered for Duncan and his brother.
Who do you think you're fooling?
You're stupid to trust him.
Nobody here is impressed by all your boasting.
Get moving, lndian.
I said, get moving.
Why don't you try and move me?
Someone in your town helped
Duncan rob that train.
He's working with him.
He betrayed all of you once,... and he could do it again.
You boys defend the train.
I'll go to Wellington to ask for help.
We will need you to take care of the wounded.
Let the sheriff go.
For my sake.
No, my dear, there's too much at stake, and I feel it is my duty to go to Wellington.
I'll start right away.
Dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return.
Grant unto thy servant Geraldine eternal rest, O Lord.
-Amen.
-Amen.
Chester.
Please be careful, darling.
Don't worry.
I'll be back.
I hope he makes it. He's taking a big risk. lf Dr. Lynne doesn't get here in time with those men, it'll be a massacre. ln the meanwhile,... just what are we going to do?
What are you complaining about?
You sent away the only man that could've been helpful.
-That lndian? He was just a liar.
-Oh, yeah?
Well, if you had seen him kill those three bandits the way I did, you wouldn't speak that way.
Maybe it was a big mistake to send that boy away.
Let's ask him to come back.
There's still time.
What do you want?
I said, what do you want?
My mistress sent me to see you.
Who is your mistress?
Dr. Lynne's wife.
Her father is the banker of Esperanza.
But she's the one who decides everything.
She thinks since you saved her father's money once, perhaps you can do it again.
She'll do anything you want.
And he'll pay the price you ask.
How did you know I was here?
I just thought you might be.
Who's lndian? Your father or your mother?
My mother.
You're a Navajo, aren't you?
What's your name?
Joe.
I've never known an lndian named Joe.
And I've never seen a Navajo so far south before.
And me, an lndian girl that asks so many questions.
Go back and tell your mistress that
I'll save her money for her.
One more thing.
I'll need some dynamite.
Don't shoot, Duncan!
I wanna talk to you.
Come here. I think you owe me a few explanations.
What's to explain?
How that lndian scum filched the train right from under you.
And now the $500,000 has been locked... up in the bank vault.
-That damned dirty lndian!
-Calm down, Duncan.
You can still help.
They're running around like a pack of scared rabbits in town.
They think I've gone to Wellington for help.
So what?
So you capture me... and you take me to Esperanza.
We go to the bank, and you force me to open the safe.
The money's there in the bank.
I know how to open the door.
Then you can give me my share.
Okay.
But be careful.
This is your last chance.
You sure he'll come?
What did he tell you, Estella?
What'll we do if he doesn't show up?
Things will be just as bad as before.
They'll be worse.
Damned lndian.
Do you think he'll come?
That's enough!
We can fight them ourselves!
All right, get up. We'll show them!
Go ahead.
Besides, we don't know if that lndian's telling the truth.
It could be a trap.
Wait a second. Didn't he bring us the money?
She's right.
I'm sure that Chester will make it to Wellington.
And he'll come back here with the Rangers.
Meanwhile, trust the lndian.
He'll guard us.
All by himself? An lndian?
Time was when we'd pay a dollar for his scalp.
No, we need the Rangers.
Don't count on that.
They won't come.
Your man took the wrong way.
What do you mean?
You'll see.
I know that I'm the man you need.
And you're absolutely sure you can fight that gang alone?
We won't be able to help you at all, don't forget.
Aman who knows what he wants... is worth a lot.
Well then, what do you want?
I told you, a dollar a head.
All right. You'll defend us.
And one other thing.
You the sheriff?
No, the deputy.
He's the sheriff.
What do you want?
-That.
-What?
You want us to appoint you as sheriff, is that it?
That's right.
But you can't.
An lndian sheriff?
The only ones elected in this country are Americans.
My father was born here, in the mountains.
His father before him and his father before him and his father before him.
Where was your father born?
But what has that to do with it?
I said, where was he born?
In Scotland.
My father was born here, in America.
And his father before him and his father before him and his father before him.
Now, which of us is American?
And that's mine.
It belongs to me.
Thanks.
-All right?
-Good.
Go home and stay there... and keep out of my way.
Get me some dynamite.
Then I'll tell you what to do with the money.
They're coming now.
The rotten filth.
Girls, don't move. Duncan's in town. lf he sees us, we're as good as dead.
Good Lord!
Why, it was utter insanity to rely on that lndian.
I hope Chester gets to Wellington.
By now, it's our only chance.
I don't know. Let's pray.
No tricks, Duncan.
Don't worry. You'll get your half.
All right, where's the money?
Or were you lying all along?
I swear. It was here.
I don't understand.
-I saw it.
-You're a liar! Where's the money?
They must've hidden it somewhere.
But I'll find it.
Where is the money?
-I tell you, I don't know.
-Where's the money?
My wife will know where they hid it. Give me time to talk to her.
Chester!
No! Oh, Chester.
No, ma'am, you must not go.
-No.
-Stay inside.
Chester!
Chester, no.
Darling.
Chester, the lndian has it all.
He hid it.
It's my fault.
-I gave it to him.
-So, all the money is with the lndian?
Forgive me, darling.
-Come here.
-No, let me go. No.
No, let me go.
Joe! Please help me.
Hey, lndian! Come out!
Come on out, do you hear me?
Throw your gun down, or I'm gonna kill this woman.
-Can you see her?
-No!
She's an lndian like you are.
Get down here fast, redskin, if you... don't want this squaw to die.
What are you waiting for?
Slaughter him!
You hear me? Slaughter him.
He's got to talk.
You damned lndian.
Where did you put all that money?
Speak up!
You'll end up talking.
Sooner or later.
I know you'd rather get a slug, but that's too simple.
First, you'll have to tell us where you hid the money.
Now, will you talk?
Where's the money?
Talk.
That's enough, brother!
We'll never know where the money is.
Corpses can't talk.
Leave him be for a while.
String him up by his feet.
You can get yourself a little fresh air tonight.
Tomorrow, after you've had a good rest, you and me will have our talk.
You frightened me, girl.
Next time you come, let us know that it's you.
Or you might get an arrow through the stomach.
We have to be prepared, in case one of Duncan's men finds us here.
Well, I've really had it.
Let's get out of this town.
-What are we waiting for, Chuck?
-Me, too.
Why, the people here are all cowards.
Didn't you see? No one even tried to save that poor lndian.
You didn't do anything either.
But why have you come to us?
Please, help me save him.
He gave himself up... to save my life.
He saved our lives, too, remember, Chuck?
Yeah, of course I do.
Estella's right. There must be something we can try.
Females!
Very well then, but I'll do it alone.
This is no job for women.
What are you doing here, huh?
-Me?
-Answer me.
I'm taking a little walk.
-Here?
-Sure, I'm just crazy about horses.
And you know what? I noticed that white one has a limp.
-Are you sure?
-Look for yourself. Look.
You dirty little...
Help!
Help!
Thank you, friend.
Thank you.
They've let the lndian get away!
They're all going to pay for this.
Listen to what I have to say. lf by noon the money hasn't turned up,... expect everyone to die!
That's absurd. They're all innocent.
Nobody knows where it's hidden.
Well, somebody does.
I'll be waiting.
For the love of God, Duncan!
I've warned you!
-I'll be leaving.
-What do you mean?
I'll just be hiding.
But I need someone to bring those men that are guarding the corral to me.
But not me, huh?
Some jobs a man can't do.
But the big blonde can do it. Maybe.
Yes, that would be exciting.
But I don't murder men.
But he said nothing of killing.
All you have to do is get him to follow you.
I'll do the rest.
Just leave it to us.
But I want you to live.
Why don't you go before it's too late?
I have to finish what I've started.
Why do you hate Duncan so much? lf it's not for the money that you kill those bandits, then why?
Someday when you grow up,... and don't ask so many questions,... maybe I'll tell you.
Well, hello.
What are you hanging around the corral for?
You know it ain't allowed.
Just as I passed here, this garter unhooked.
I'd certainly appreciate a little friendly assistance?
With pleasure. I know all about these things.
It tickles. Thanks a lot.
You certainly are one big barrel of fun.
Let's have a little kiss for the hero, huh?
Oh, no, no. Not here.
Why don't you come to my cabin later?
Don't be late now, and bring your buddy for my girlfriend.
Wait! Wait!
Barbara, what happened?
-They're coming.
-Come on.
Coming?
I found two girls. Come on!
What about the horses?
Let them find their own girls.
Here we are, beautiful.
Go on, move. Get!
Barbara, they did it.
All right.
You want to finish your days as sheriff?
Or are you gonna tell me?
Where's the money?
I don't know. I swear to you.
-But you let him get away.
-I don't know.
-No, I assure you.
-Come on, you know where. Start talking.
I swear. I don't know. I swear.
I swear to you.
All I know is that the telegraph gave the alarm for the fire at Pyote.
You're all in danger. The soldiers will be here.
Then get going. Go on.
You shoot, Jeff.
Did you all hear that outside?
Now it's time for three more of you.
And if you don't decide to talk, I'll kill you all.
One way or another.
Do you hear me?
One way or another.
Duncan, why are we wasting time?
Let's kill them all and get out of here.
Enough of this business.
What else can we do?
We better go back before the army is all over us.
We'll leave exactly when I say so, is that clear?
And I ain't leaving till I learn what they did with it.
The soldiers will find a town full of corpses.
I'm a man of God and I wouldn't lie to save my own life.
We don't know anything about the lndian or the money.
You've killed my daughter and nothing matters to me anymore. lf I knew anything, I'd tell you.
What's happening?
They've let the horses loose. And here's a message from the lndian.
It was attached to an arrow.
We saw shadows and we attacked, but he got away.
But they left your horse behind.
And where's the money?
It says in this note. He wants it read aloud.
It's addressed to your attention.
Where is the money?
On the locomotive. lf he hears another shot,... he'll get on the train and take it away with him.
Without horses, there's no way out.
We'll see.
Jeffrey, take my horse and ride fast to the station. lf you find the money, blow the train whistle three times.
Then take off alone for Hot Springs.
We'll join you with the train.
Right away.
But why just him alone?
Because I say so!
We'll wait right here.
And if it's a trap,... and none of this is true,...
I'm gonna set the church on fire with all of you in it.
But for what reason?
That message is proof we know nothing about it.
Speak to your heart. l beg this of you.
Nobody ever had mercy on me.
When I was a boy they beat me,... even called me bastard.
I didn't cry and I couldn't fight back.
So that began my revenge to get back at them.
Brought out my hatred for the lndians, like my mother.
And to kill white people, like my father.
My father, a preacher like you, a minister.
Bred by mercy.
But I got a bad break when somebody killed him and beat me to the punch.
The signal! He found the money.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Let's go, you guys.
Thank you, Duncan.
For mercy and sparing our lives.
Look at that. They're all going away!
Come on, hurry.
-Let me on.
-Let's get up.
-Give me a hand.
-Come on.
-All right, let's go.
-Hurry up.
-Everybody on there.
-All right.
-Move it out. Come on.
-All right.
Make this old crate move. We have to reach Jeffrey fast.
You heard him, boys!
Look! The lndian.
What is it?
-Why are you shooting?
-Duncan! The lndian!
He's in front of the train. l recognize his horse.
Come on, feed it some coal! We're gonna catch that pig.
Come on, move!
He's yours, Duncan. Get him now.
Jeffrey.
I got to the train,... found the cash, but the lndian came from behind.
You, Sancho, come with me.
Duncan, hold it a minute.
Who knows where he's hiding?
We may be walking into a trap.
Go on, hero. Move.
It looks like a mine.
Go on.
Both of us.
You dig in here. Keep a look out.
Nobody.
Now we got him, behind the rocks over there.
Duncan,... we're in the open here.
He'll pick us off easy.
Get moving!
But I don't want to be killed.
Move, I said.
I'm getting out of here, and to hell with the money!
Get back here!
Come back, you coward!
You won't escape now, redskin.
You sweating?
You all ready to give up now?
Come on out, lndian.
Come on out, you're finished.
You're through.
I'm too smart to fall for that trick.
Come on out, lndian! It's all over.
I'll pin your scalp to my saddle!
That's foryou, filthy, stinking lndian.
Come on, lndian. Come on out.
Or would you rather not come out and rot for killing Jeffrey?
Damn you, lndian.
Face it, lndian. I outsmarted you.
Throw down your belt.
There you are.
You won.
You're real smart, hombre.
Why did you follow me?
Because you want to kill me?
I know you're a bounty killer.
You want to have my bounty. But you can have the money, if you want.
But let me live.
You killed my brother.
Broke up my gang.
Let me live.
This belonged to my woman.
Do you remember her? Huh?
Okay.
You're gonna pay for her life.
It's our money.
The lndian kept his promise.
Where is he?
Who cares? The money is all that counts.
-Take his horse to the corral.
-No!
Let him go.
He knows where to go.
Go back to him.
Go.
Go.
Turn him over.
Oh, no!
"Do not drink wine nor strong drink...
"thou, nor thy sons with thee...
"lest ye shall die.
"Look not thou upon the wine when it is red...
"and when it bringeth his color in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.
"At the last it biteth like a serpent...

Now, folks... that's from the Good Book... but in this here town... it's five cents a glass.
Five cents a glass.
Does anyone really think that that is the price of a drink?
The price of a drink? Let him decide... who has lost his courage and his pride... who lies a groveling heap of clay not far removed...
All's quiet, sir.
Let's fall in.
Follow me.
I beg your pardon, ma'am.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Allow me, ma'am.
Thank you.
May I?
Thank you.
Thornton, wake up! Soldiers!
Take a look.
I don't care what you meant to do... it's what you did I don't like.
You inconvenienced this lady, and made a fool of yourself... and this railroad in the bargain.
Now, I want you to apologize to this...
Yes, sir, can I help you?
If they move, kill them.
Is he with them?
He's there.
Hold your fire! Get down!
Wait till they come out.
I can nail him.
I said, wait!
What if they slip out the back way?
It's covered.
You two-bit redneck peckerwood.
Abe?
I solemnly promise...
God helping me...
"I solemnly promise, God helping me."
...to abstain from all distilled, fermented malt liquors... including wine, beer and cider.
"To abstain from liquor, wine, cider and beer."
People marching and singing, coming down the street.
They're gonna pass by the horses.
We'll join them.
The Temperance Union?
They should have been told.
Told what?
How long do you think anybody in this manure pile... could keep his mouth shut?
Yes, we'll gather at the river
The beautiful, beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
Rifles.
One?
No, three!
Maybe more, there, on the roof.
Get down.
Son of a bitch!
- Lyle, Dutch.
- What are they, bounty hunters?
Hell, I wouldn't know.
Buck, with Abe.
- I kill them now?
- No.
Hold them here as long as you can until after the shooting starts.
I'll hold them till hell freezes over or you say different.
When I kick him out, blast them.
We'll make a run for it.
C.L., give me that shotgun.
The beautiful, beautiful river
Gather with the saints at the river
That flows by the throne of God
Set?
Let's go!
Good luck, boys!
They're blowing this town all to hell!
You're trash!
Now, you just hush now.
They was playing Gather at the River.
You know that one?
Sing it!
Shall we gather at the river
Where bright angel feet have trod
Hurry!
River that flows by the throne of God
Come on, you lazy bastard!
I'm coming, damn it!
They've cleared out, for Christ's sake!
Let's go, T. C!
Put some more on!
Let's go!
Take him!
He's mine!
- He's mine!
- Mr. Harrigan.
He's mine!
I shot this one!
Look at the size of that hole!
You just dig out that bullet and see if it ain't my.06!
You know I shot him.
You'd claim the whole thing, wouldn't you?
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Did he have any money?
Damn, I can't get his belt off!
You stupid, damn fools!
Why did you shoot this employee and let the others get away?
I didn't shoot that employee!
My first shot killed this man right here!
Liar!
He shot that employee while I was dropping this bandit and them others, too.
I must've killed all three of them.
Killed all three of them?
What were we doing up on that roof?
Liar! Black liar!
You shouldn't talk like that to me.
I'm sorry.
Come on, T.C., help me get his boots.
I think this will do pretty good.
Harrigan!
Next time, you better plan the massacre more carefully, or I'll start with you.
Why didn't you kill Pike when you had the chance?
Stop!
Feathers flew like a turkey!
They shouldn't have run.
Say!
How'd you like to kiss my sister's black cat's ass?
This is better than a hog-killing!
Get them out of here!
We're holding you and your whole damn railroad responsible for this carnage!
- Mr. Benson...
- Innocent people are dead!
Women dying and mangled because you used our town as a battlefield!
You're going to pay! The railroad is going to pay for our loss of blood!
We were trying to catch a band of outlaws!
You lured that gang in here!
The railroad has been blabbing their mouth about a big payload for weeks!
We represent the law!
Pike, is that you?
I can ride, Pike.
I can ride.
I can't see, but I can ride.
God!
No!
I can't ride.
Finish it.
You boys want to move on, or stay and give him... a decent burial?
He was a good man.
I think we ought to bury him.
He's dead!
He's got a lot of good men back there to keep him company!
Too damn many!
I think the boys are right.
I'd like to say a few words for the dear, dead departed.
Maybe a few hymns'd be in order!
Followed by a church supper... with a choir!
You crazy bastards, both of you!
Bishop, Engstrom, the Gorch brothers!
Amounts to a total of $4,500 and you let them ride out on you!
When the hard-money value of the men you killed... less my commission, adds up to $500!
Any one of those pelts would've not only cleared you with the company... but given you a bundle of money to raise hell with!
We'll do better next time!
We'll do anything you say, but we sure would appreciate liquor money for tonight.
There won't be any tonight!
You go after them in ten minutes!
Get them! Get Pike and you'll be rich!
If one of you tries to quit on me...
I'll pay a bonus of $1,000... to the man that kills him!
Let's pack it up then!
- Mr. Harrigan.
- Why should I let you go with them?
We've been over that.
You might run off with them.
Might even join them again.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
What I like and what I need are two different things.
Listen, Mr. Harrigan.
I don't want to go back to prison, never again.
But it's got to be my way!
I need some good men!
You saw what happened out there this morning!
You'll use what you have and you'll see to it that it doesn't happen again... or I'll see you spend the rest of your life behind bars.
Try to run,
I'll be after you and so will they.
I gave you my word.
Well, we'll see what it's worth!
Six minutes.
Tell me, Mr. Harrigan, how does it feel... getting paid for it?
Getting paid to sit back and hire your killings with the law's arms around you?
How's it feel to be so goddamn right?
Good.
You dirty son of a bitch!
You've got 30 days to get Pike or 30 days back to Yuma.
You're my Judas goat, Mr. Thornton.
I want all of them back here, head down over a saddle.
Thirty days to get Pike or 30 days back to Yuma.
I don't see nothing so lindo about it.
Just looks like more of Texas as far as I'm concerned.
You have no eyes.
Got a half-hour of light. Let's go.
Hello, little fella.
- Them other fellas...
- They're not coming!
- None of them?
- No.
- But I got horses and saddles for them.
- We'll need them, they won't.
Now, about the sharing up.
The sharing up will be the same as always.
Well, me and Tector don't think that he ought to get the same amount.
He's just starting out, and this is mine and Tector's opening for a new territory.
That's right.
And I figure a share to that old goat for watching them horses... is damn sure a share too much.
So, we decided... it ain't fair.
If you two boys don't like equal shares, why in the hell don't you just take all of it?
Well, why don't you answer me, you damned, yellow-livered trash?
Now, Pike, you know damn well...
I don't know a damned thing except that
I either lead this bunch or end it right now.
All right.
We divide it up just like you say.
Chick, chick, chick, chick.
Silver rings.
Silver rings, your butt!
Them's washers! Damn!
Bastards!
Washers!
Washers!
We shot our way out of that town for a dollar's worth of steel holes!
They set it up!
They? Who in the hell is "they"?
"They?"
Why, "they" is just plain and fancy "they."
That's who "they" is.
Caught you, didn't they?
Tied a tin can to your tail!
Led you in and waltzed you out again!
Oh, my, what a bunch!
Big tough one!
Here you are with a handful of holes, a thumb up your ass... and a big grin to pass the time of day with.
"They!"
Who the hell is "they"?
Railroad men.
Bounty hunters.
Deke Thornton.
Deke Thornton?
He was one of them?
How the hell come you didn't know that?
Hey, gringo.
You can have my silver.
Come on, gringo, don't kill me.
You can have the silver.
But don't kill me.
Please?
Go on... go for it.
Fall apart.
Walk softly, boys.
What's our next move?
I figure Agua Verde is the closest.
Three days, maybe.
We'll get the news and drift to the border.
Maybe a payroll, maybe a bank.
Maybe that damn railroad!
That damn railroad you're talking about sure as hell ain't getting no easier.
And you boys ain't getting any younger, either.
We gotta start thinking beyond our guns.
Those days are closing fast.
All your fancy planning and talking damn near got us shot to pieces... over a few lousy bags of washers.
Well, this was going to be me and Tector's last job before we quit and headed south!
We spent all our time and money getting ready for this!
You spent all your time and money running whores in Hondo... while I spent my stake setting it up!
Hell, I should have been running whores instead of stealing army horses!
While you was doing all that planning... me and Tector was getting our bell rope pulled by two... two, mind you, Hondo whores!
And Pike was dreaming of washers!
He was.
You were matching whores... in tandem!
What's that?
That's one behind the other.
That's right! That's what we was doing!
Mr. Thornton?
You rode with Pike.
What kind of man are we up against?
The best.
He never got caught.
This was going to be my last.
Ain't getting around any better.
I'd like to make one good score and back off.
Back off to what?
Have you got anything lined up?
Pershing's got troops spread out all along the border.
Every one of those garrisons are gonna be getting a payroll.
That kind of information is kind of hard to come by.
I didn't say it's going to be easy, but it can be done.
He'll be waiting for us.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
Come on, Pike, let's go.
You sound like you're all caught up.
Caught up enough to know we've overstayed our welcome.
What the hell's the matter with you?
We've got plenty of money to spend, and not a worry in the world.
They're not going to look for us in their own backyard.
How can you be so damn sure?
Being sure is my business.
Being sure is my business.
- Hold it!
- Relax.
It's just some champagne we ordered.
Relax. It's just some champagne we ordered.
Being sure is my business.
Did you get him?
No, the bastard got away.
Damn, you sure must have hurt that railroad.
They spent a lot of money setting up that ambush.
I caught up with them.
Two or three times.
There was a man named Harrigan.
He used to have a way of doing things.
I made him change his ways.
And a hell of a lot of people... that just can't stand to be wrong.
Pride.
And they can't forget it.
That pride, being wrong, or learn by it.
How about us, Pike?
You reckon we learned... being wrong today?
I sure hope to God we did.
Them's hot.
Damn!
Where in the hell did you ever find him?
He used to run with Thornton and me.
Did his share of killing, and more.
Around Langtry.
Yeah, only now he does his killing with a coffee cup.
Pike...
I wouldn't have it any other way either.
Watch out, boys!
Go on, easy.
Watch it, Tector!
That goddamned son of a bitch!
Get those horses up!
What the hell is going...
Damned old punk! Bastard!
Get up now! Get up there, goddamn it!
Get over here!
What in the hell's the matter with you, old man?
Leave him alone!
He's going to get us all killed!
I'm going to get rid of him.
You're not getting rid of anybody! We're gonna stick together, like it used to be.
When you side with a man, you stay with him.
And if you can't do that, you're like some animal!
You're finished!
We're finished! All of us!
Mount up.
Appears Brother Pike needs help,
Brother Lyle.
That Brother Pike and the old man Sykes... makes a man wonder if it ain't time... to pick up his chips and find another game.
How in the hell are you going to side anybody... when you can't even get on your horse?
That was a mighty fine talk you gave the boys back there about sticking together.
That Gorch came near killing me.
Or me him.
Damned old fool like me's not worth taking along!
- We started together, we'll end it together.
- By God, that's the way I see it.
That's the way it's always been with me.
Sorry about Deke.
I never figured him that way.
Say, back there in Starbuck... how did my boy do?
Your boy?
Crazy Lee?
Yes, C.L., Clarence Lee.
My daughter's boy.
Not too bright, but a good boy.
I kill them now? I kill them now?
No, you just hold them here.
Hold them here.
Why didn't you tell me he was your grandson?
You had enough things on your mind.
Besides, he had to pull his own weight just like the rest of us.
I just wanted to make sure he didn't let you down, run, when things got hot.
No, he did fine.
Just fine.
All clear!
From here on it's Mexico, Mr. Thornton.
What's the closest town of any size?
Agua Verde.
What's in Agua Verde?
Mexicans, what else?
A headquarters for regulars fighting against Villa.
Mapache territory.
Don't we follow?
No, we go back and wait.
- Damn it! Go find...
- Shut up!
Why in the hell won't you tell your folks to feed them dogs?
Won't find very much around here.
That damn Huerta's scraped it clean.
I have invited you to my village, to my home.
Any disrespect to my family or to my people...
I will kill you.
Ashamed of having us meet your people?
Yes. They don't know about my life when I leave the village.
- You got a sister?
- Yes.
I'd be proud to make her acquaintance.
And that of your mama too.
That goes for your grandma too, sonny.
How bad did they hit you?
Seven of the villagers were killed.
Two of them hung.
Our horses, cattle and corn, stolen.
What about the federal troops?
Didn't they give you any protection?
They were federal troops... commissioned by the traitor, Huerta.
And the soldier who shot my father?
What was his name?
- What the hell difference does it make?
- Your father died like a man.
Names in this matter do not have any importance.
How was he called?
Mapache.
That is name enough.
In Mexico, señor... these are the years of sadness.
But if we had... rifles like these...
And Teresa? Did they molest her?
She went with them because she wished to.
She became the woman of Mapache... and the others.
She went with them, laughing.
Drunk with wine and love.
To him, Teresa was like a goddess, to be worshipped from afar.
I tell you, she was a mango... ripe and waiting.
Angel dreams of love and Mapache eats the mango.
That's a good trick.
Now that I find hard to believe.
Not so hard.
We all dream of being a child again.
Even the worst of us.
Perhaps the worst most of all.
You know what we are, then?
Yes, just so, the both of you!
And you!
Where is Mapache?
All right, Pike? All right?
Tector, let's swap!
Come on, let's swap!
You must tell me. Where is Mapache?
Why do you wish to know?
For your father?
Or the whore?
Either you learn to live with it or we'll leave you here.
I go with you, Jefe.
You know what I'm going to do?
I'm gonna steal his girl.
You are?
Here I go.
Dutch, I'm cutting in.
Come on, lady!
No gringos?
Only federales.
All soldiers.
Not a bounty hunter in sight.
Now, what in the hell is that?
I saw one just like it in Waco.
Run on steam?
No, on alcohol or gasoline.
Hey, Pike, you know what I hear?
I hear they got one of those things up north that can fly.
That was a balloon, you damned old fool.
No, the old man's right.
They've got motors and wings and go 60 miles in less than an hour.
Going to use them in the war they say.
Well, let's go and talk to the General... about his automobile and our extra horses.
Nice and easy.
Probably talking about us behind our backs.
I'm down to about twenty in silver.
With the way the Generalísimo's cleaned out this part of the country... he ought to have a lot to spare.
Generalísimo, hell.
He's just another bandit grabbing all he can for himself.
Like some others I could mention.
Not so as you'd know it, Mr. Bishop.
We ain't nothing like him.
We don't hang nobody.
I hope someday these people here kick him... and the rest of the scum like him right into their graves.
We will.
If it takes forever!
Look here.
Pretty good-looking old pony, ain't he?
Boy, do you know them beauties?
Come on.
- She was my woman.
- I know.
Sure ain't your woman no more.
Just look at her licking inside that general's ear.
Why did he try to kill His Excellency?
He didn't try to kill His Excellency.
He was after the girl.
He went a little crazy when he saw her with you.
Are you men associated with the American Army?
No, we're not associated with anybody.
I see.
I was curious about the equipment which you are carrying. That pistol... is restricted for the use of army personnel.
It can't be purchased or even owned... legally.
- Is that so?
- Weapons are a specialty of mine.
I am Commander Frederick Mohr of the Imperial German Army.
It would be very useful for us if we knew of some Americans... who did not share their government's naive sentiments.
Well, we share very few sentiments with our government.
He's asking us to have a drink with him.
Good.
Shoot him.
I gave it to him, T.C.
- You mean here?
- No, no, not there!
Wait a minute, now, what you going to do?
We got to show a little class here.
Right here!
It must be that garrison rail spur.
I know it's the easiest to hit, but I gotta figure some way to get it out of there.
What do you think, Dutch?
Getting pretty close to home, ain't it?
Look at them gathered around that big table.
Here we sit like kitchen help.
Why do you want us to hit a train like that at the border?
Can't the General just go up there and take over the whole thing?
General Huerta is anxious to better relations with the United States... not to cross the border and destroy them.
Usually these arms shipments are kept pretty secret.
How'd you find out about this one?
Mapache has a superb intelligence force... organized under supervision of my commanding officer.
Now, gentlemen, we are quite well organized... and able to pay $10,000... in gold.
Of course, if you're not able to do the work, we'll find someone else.
We can do it. It's just that we're going to need special equipment.
Do not worry.
Our accountant will take care of everything.
General... soon you will be the best-equipped general in Mexico.
Well, look here... ain't he the one?
To the host!
With your permission, I need a bath.
With my permission,
I think you all need a bath.
I don't need no bath!
What me and Tector need is a couple of them women you're hogging.
You think you can fix that up for us?
Gentlemen, you will excuse me, I'm sure.
I'm sure.
- Herrera.
- Let's get Angel.
Por favor, General, I need him.
I'll give you someone much better than that.
If you don't mind, I'll make my own choice.
All right.
He is not important to me. Take him.
I think we're gonna get on the wagon now.
Hey, here come our sweeties.
Ain't them pretty?
I don't know about yours, Lyle, but...
I think I got more than I can handle.
Hey, get out of there.
You know what they told me?
The dons of Spain built this over 300 years ago.
- Is that right?
- That's right.
I tell you, Lyle, I'm all for them dons.
Let's have a little target.
She ain't going to get away.
Turn her loose.
Why not!
Tector, look at them beauties!
How in the hell can you stand it that hot?
I'm going to build me one of these some day and live in it.
Hell, Lyle, look here.
Come on, sweetheart, let me see your teatsies.
I don't know why the hell
I didn't let them kill you.
Listen, I'm not going to steal guns for that devil to rob and kill my people again.
Noble, noble. Very noble.
I didn't see no tears rolling down your cheeks when you rode in from Starbuck.
They were not my people.
I care about my people, my village.
Listen, boy, you ride with us, your village don't count.
If it does, you just don't go along.
Then I don't go along.
Angel, one load of guns ain't going to stop them raiding villages.
Why, you ought to be thinking about all the money you're gonna have.
Buy them a ranch. Move them 1,000 miles.
- Buy them two or three ranches.
- One.
A very small one.
Don't you see? This is their land.
No one is going to drive them away.
I'll drink to that sentiment.
And to love.
But most of all, I'll drink to gold!
Angel.
You're a pain in the ass.
Would you give guns to someone to kill your father... or your mother, or your brother?
Ten thousand cuts an awful lot of family ties.
My people have no guns.
But with guns... my people could fight.
If I could take guns...
I would come with you.
Say, how many cases of rifles did Zamorra say was in that shipment?
Sixteen.
Well... give him one.
All right.
One case and one case of ammo.
But you give up your share of the gold.
I will.
- We know you will.
- Sure glad we got that settled.
Why, you reprobate!
Boys...
I want you to meet my fiancée.
They just got engaged.
I'm a son of a bitch!
Trot them on in, fellas.
I'm hell on packing mules, but I'm a delight with a pretty girl.
You want to gamble everything that this one shipment will be attacked?
If they're in Agua Verde, they'll try for it.
- If? What about Juarez?
- If he was, we would've heard about it.
If they are in Agua Verde, they will have seen Mapache.
And who in the hell is Mapache?
A killer for Huerta who calls himself a general.
He's been fighting Villa and losing.
But with enough guns, he could become a power in northern Mexico.
My guess is,
Pike will try to get them for him.
How can he? The train will be guarded by regular troops.
Not regular troops, green recruits not worth a damn.
I need 20 trained men, not recruits.
And not this gutter trash you've given me.
What you've got is 24 more days.
Never told me how you got all torn up like that.
I met a woman I wanted to marry.
- Is your husband coming back?
- No.
He's never coming back.
But you are late.
Two days late.
She had a husband.
If I'd had any sense, I'd have killed him.
He wasn't around.
I got careless.
One night, he walked in on us.
Got her with the first shot, and got me here with the second.
Then the damn coward turned and ran.
Ever catch up with him?
No, but there isn't a day or an hour that passes that I don't think about it.
Come on, pretty! We've got a long way!
This is our last go around, Dutch.
This time, we do it right.
Just do your work.
Let's go!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Faster!
Get over!
Get that ramp up!
Get that horse out of here!
Bring them all out! Get them out!
Get over here!
Get them over here! Get those horses!
Hurry up!
Your horse kicked me.
Run them up along here!
Where the hell is my horse?
Hey, we got grenades!
- Hurry up! We gotta get out of here!
- Be careful with this, boys!
Let's go on this.
Here we go.
All right, line up in a column of twos!
Corporal, give us a hand here!
Hey, Pike, we're all ready!
Let's go!
Come on!
Get after that horse!
That was my horse!
Get after him!
You men get out!
Get that damn horse off my butt!
Get those horses out of here!
The train's coming back!
Train?
- Where?
- What train?
I don't see any train.
Get the goddamn horse off my foot!
Corporal, ride back to the telegraph at Todos Malos... and tell the railroad deputies they robbed the train... and we're in pursuit!
Yes, sir!
Come on!
Dutch!
Damn son of a...
Come on! It's lit!
Get them horses going!
Don't shoot at the army, you idiots!
Come on, Pike!
Let's go!
Come on, you lazy bastard!
I'm coming, damn it!
- Is it all right?
- Yep.
Where are they supposed to meet us?
Agua Verde or before.
But when we do meet them, don't expect any open arms.
Least we won't have to worry about Deke Thornton.
Hell, no. Not after riding a half a case of dynamite into the river.
Don't expect him to stay there.
He'll be along and you know it.
I sure would like to get hold of that fool horse of mine.
Some Mex kid's probably riding him home right now.
I don't see how I could've lost both my boots.
They always were hard as hell to get on.
That damn river sucked them right off.
That damn dynamite helped some.
Maybe the same kid that's riding T.C.'s horse is wearing your boots right now.
You stupid bastards!
Why did you fire at those soldiers?
Huey started firing at them.
I even tried to stop him.
- One of the bandits...
- Don't blame it on me!
Liar!
Shut your mouths!
Are we going after them?
We are, unless you want to face a firing squad.
Come on, T. C!
Why the hell do we have to leave now?
Besides, my hair's wet!
Impossible! We have no arms or ammunition.
The gringos assaulted the train!
They got the guns.
We must go!
Take the necessary people and take the road to Agua Verde.
Convince the gringos to give you the guns.
I'll wait for you in the village.
If the gringos refuse?
He's still heading east.
Are they bluffing, or did they really miss it?
I'd say they missed it. Here, take a look.
There's only five left.
- Hell, we lost them.
- I don't see how we lost them.
Unless it was in the big valley where the ground was hard.
Wasn't but one way they could take a wagon out of there, and this here is it.
They didn't take it out.
And we haven't lost them.
I could point to them right now.
Sit still, damn it!
You think Pike and old Sykes haven't been watching us?
They know what this is all about.
And what do I have?
Nothing but you egg-sucking, chicken-stealing gutter trash... with not even 60 rounds between you.
We're after men.
And I wish to God I was with them.
The next time you make a mistake,
I'm gonna ride off and let you die.
Come on.
I never figured they'd come down here after us.
How much you reckon we could be worth?
Depends on how hungry they are.
You better stay here and look out for big hats.
I'll go down and start rigging the fireworks.
All right.
Angel... get that case of explosives off the back there!
Lyle... hand me down those blasting caps.
What're you gonna do with the dynamite?
I figure that damn general will try to take this load without paying for it... and shoot us in the bargain.
The only thing to change his mind is if something happened to these guns.
I'm gonna make sure something could happen.
Pike, take a look at this.
Think you can handle that?
What I don't know about,
I sure as hell am going to learn.
My people are here for their guns.
Where the hell were you when you were supposed to be guarding us.
I never heard them, didn't even see them.
They apologize and ask you to forgive them for their lack of trust.
But only by caution do they remain alive.
Tell them not to break that fuse.
These people from your village?
They are part of the village, but not from it.
They are puro Indio and these mountains belong to them.
I'd say those fellows know how to handle themselves.
They've been fighting Apaches for 1,000 years. That's a sure way to learn.
If they ever get armed, with good leaders, this whole country will go up in smoke.
That it will, son. That it will.
They made damn fools out of us,
Mr. Bishop.
Getting so a fella can't sleep with both eyes closed... for fear of getting his throat cut.
Where in the hell were you?
Now, you listen to me, Lyle.
If you got up off your ass and helped once in a while...
I wouldn't have got caught near so easy.
With the new guns and ammunition, this could never have happened.
Swing your leaders wide, old man!
Bring them on!
Come on, horse!
- Hold up!
- Whoa there!
Mapache's?
Let's just hope they don't belong to Villa.
We are friends.
We are from el General Mapache.
Tell the one out in front to come over here.
Alone.
I am coming.
I am your friend, remember?
We are friends. All of us.
I bring you love and affection from el General.
You bring the guns with you?
What bravery you have done!
I am to escort you to the General.
- Tell him to come closer.
- I hear.
I am coming, my friend.
You know what this is?
Any trouble, no guns for the General.
Very smart!
That's very smart for you damn gringos.
So nobody can rob the guns.
Nobody.
I am not afraid. They are not afraid.
You blow up the wagon, you die.
Or we kill you pretty soon.
- But we are amigos.
- Show them, boys.
Start the ball, Tector.
Please, cut the fuse.
Please.
El General waits in Agua Verde to meet with you.
Tell the General one of us will be there to trade tomorrow.
Any trouble, no guns.
Damn gringos!
Get them up there, Freddie!
Pull them over!
You bring the guns?
Don't worry, we've got them.
Hidden.
When I get my share of the gold,
$2,500 worth...
I'll tell you where four cases are.
The others are waiting for me back at the wagon.
If I don't show up pretty quick, they'll blow it.
You fix it goddamn good, no?
You fooled me.
Our accountant will pay you immediately.
When do we get our guns?
The quicker I get back, the quicker you get the next load.
Open it up.
Up the arroyo, about two miles... you'll find three cases of rifles... and one case of ammunition hidden in the bush behind them.
I understand you have a machine gun.
Our contract called for 16 cases of rifles... and ammunition for $10,000.
Not a machine gun.
That's our present to the General.
Gringo, you fight with Mapache...
I'll think about it.
In case he don't find them...
Go. I trust him.
- Why the hell don't you stir up some grub?
- Why don't you go to hell?
Shit!
Damn it!
Damn it, Pike must've found you under a rock.
You gonna whip me?
Nope.
But you better just hope
I don't get riled enough... to start dogging you when this is over.
You're not going to get a chance to dry gulch me, old man.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Pike's coming!
He's got it. Carrying gold.
Any trouble?
Just from carrying this weight.
- Pike, I want to go next.
- All right.
You and your brother take the next load, along with the machine gun.
Then Angel and Dutch. Freddie, you follow and pick up the pack horses.
It must be mounted on a tripod!
It must be mounted on a tripod!
Crazy bastards!
Put it on the tripod!
We brought the last of it, General.
At the head of the arroyo, in the wagon.
You can have the wagon, we'll take the horses.
How many cases did you take from the train?
Sixteen cases of rifles.
We lost one on the trail.
He stole it.
The mother of the girl he killed told me so.
Well, I'm wasting time here.
He's a thief. You take care of him.
Well, he had guts.
We're just lucky he didn't talk.
He played his string right out to the end.
Her own mama turned him in like some kind of a Judas.
Sykes says we ought to go after him.
How in the hell are we gonna do that?
They got guns and 200 men.
No way.
No way at all.
Is that Sykes?
Mapache!
Thornton.
I got him.
They got Freddie.
Looks like he's hit pretty bad.
Damn that Deke Thornton to hell!
What would you do in his place?
He gave his word.
Gave his word to a railroad.
It's his word!
That ain't what counts!
It's who you give it to!
We can stay up here and kick hell out of them!
That's what we can do.
No, we're running short of water.
Make a run for the border?
They'd follow us every step of the way.
I know Thornton.
I'm tired of being hunted.
Let's go back to Agua Verde.
Let the General take care of those boys.
You're crazy.
That general would just as soon kill us as break wind.
He's so tickled with those guns... he'll be celebrating for a week and happy to do us a favor.
Thornton's not gonna follow us in there.
While they're busy picking over Freddie... we'll find a back trail off this mountain and head for town.
What about our gold?
We'll take one sack to pay our way.
Bury the rest.
Together.
Look out!
Lots of blood, then it stops. No track.
- $10 says he's dead by now.
- Take us a day to find him if he is.
If he isn't, he has a gun on us right now.
Let's go after the others.
Just leave him here? He's worth money.
Yes, you ride out tomorrow, that is if you can stay on your horse... and watch the buzzards.
They'll show you where he is.
What if he ain't dead, Mr. Thornton?
That's your problem. Let's go!
- God, I hate to see that.
- No more than I do.
Welcome, amigos!
You come for your friend, no?
I want to buy him back.
I don't think he looks worth too much.
I don't think he's going to live too long.
I'll give you half of my share for him.
I need no gold and I don't sell this one.
Why not? You've had your fun with him.
El Generalísimo's happy with the guns.
Why don't you go and get a drink?
Enjoy yourself.
There are women everywhere.
Don't be foolish and change his mood.
Son of a bitch!
Why not?
There ain't nobody here!
There's wagon tracks and somebody was here!
They sure as hell ain't here now!
Army patrol!
Coming this way!
You said dos for two!
Here's your dos and one to grow on.
That's all you're gonna get out of me.
Let's go.
Why not?
What do you want?
We want Angel.
You want Angel, no? All right.
I'm going to give him to you.
Bitch!
Come on, you lazy bastard!
Give them hell, Pike!
No, Pike!
Pike.
Pike.
Look at them.
- Come on.
- I'm coming.
Wait for me!
- Come on, let's get all the guns.
- This is fine!
This is just like a big old picnic!
Here's a rifle for you.
He's got a gun.
T.C., it's them!
It's the Gorches!
Get up there, Coffer. Come on.
Mr. Thornton, it's them.
It is them.
Here's a boy's got some gold in his teeth.
Let me see your knife.
- Here.
- Let me see your knife!
Mr. Thornton.
Should we load up?
Are we going to wait for Jess or meet him on the way?
If he's waiting for them buzzards to lead him to old Sykes, he's got a long wait.
Look! We got them all.
T.C., there he is.
There's Pike.
There, you ain't so damned much now, are you, Mr. Pike?
You ain't coming?
No.
Maybe we ought to wait here for Jess.
No, we pick him up on the way.
I want to get out of this damn place.
Anyway, these boys'll start going ripe on us by tomorrow.
We got to move.
I went to the river and I couldn't get across
Singing 'polly wolly doodle'all the day
I jumped on a buzzard 'cause
I thought he was a horse
Singing 'polly wolly doodle'all the day
Fare thee well
- Didn't expect to find you here.
- Why not?
I sent them back.
- That's all I said I'd do.
- They didn't get very far.
I figured.
What are your plans?
Drift around down here.
Try to stay out of jail.
Well, me and the boys here... we got some work to do.
You want to come along?
Ain't like it used to be, but it'll do.
English
{3634}{3681}Thank you, Jesu.
{3949}{4063}Señor, the widow Gomez|has delivered a son this morning.
{4067}{4110}A boy.
{4132}{4169}Bully for the widow Gomez.
{4180}{4253}But, señor, it has been|more than a year ago...
{4257}{4346}...since Señor Antonio Gomez|has been buried in the church house.
{4351}{4445}Well, there are some men you just can't|trust to stay where you put them.
{4544}{4581}You gamblers?
{4616}{4661}Just get off the stage?
{4665}{4712}You got eyes in your head, ain't you?
{4740}{4786}It's what I'm paid for.
{4823}{4856}Oh, the marshal, huh?
{4867}{4906}All right, now.
{4911}{4982}The stage is leaving|in about 15 minutes.
{4986}{5081}You fellas want a drink, there's|a cantina down the street a piece.
{5085}{5142}They're not too particular|about their customers.
{5146}{5243}- Look here, whatever your name is...|- The name's McCabe.
{5247}{5279}Guthrie McCabe.
{5343}{5417}We was just passing through.|Nice little town you have here.
{5421}{5467}Did you say they serve|good whiskey?
{5471}{5503}No.
{5937}{6009}Detail, ho!
{6123}{6178}- Hi, Jim.|- Hiya.
{6182}{6271}- How are things out at Fort Grant?|- Same as usual.
{6305}{6375}Who is it? Is that Sergeant Posey?|Sergeant Posey?
{6414}{6462}I hardly recognised you.
{6487}{6540}Haven't you put on some weight?
{6641}{6688}Well, that's a nice...
{6692}{6752}...dirty, thirsty-looking outfit|you got there, Jim.
{6756}{6835}- Forty miles.|- Forty miles, huh?
{6839}{6910}Hey, you men!|How about a nice cold beer?
{6914}{6977}As you were.
{6997}{7051}I haven't dismissed|the detail, sergeant.
{7055}{7080}No, sir.
{7091}{7196}And before I do, I want one thing|clearly understood.
{7200}{7274}We're riding out of here|in a couple of hours.
{7278}{7334}And I mean riding, not floating.
{7359}{7423}"Riding not floating," that's good.|I'm gonna use that.
{7427}{7500}And just because Marshal McCabe here|has been generous enough...
{7504}{7582}...to set us up to five or six beers...|- I didn't say five or...
{7586}{7650}...that's no reason to abuse|his hospitality.
{7654}{7722}- Hey, just one beer.|- I count on your discretion, sergeant.
{7726}{7804}That's all. Detail dismissed!
{7835}{7877}- Hiya, Guthrie.|- Oh, no. Oh, no.
{7881}{7913}What?
{7957}{8018}- Jim, good to see you.|- Good to see you.
{8022}{8087}- You know, l... No, wait a minute.|- What?
{8091}{8150}Jesu, fetch a ladder...
{8154}{8243}...so that Sergeant Posey can get up|on that poor, unfortunate animal.
{8459}{8504}By George, he made it.
{8509}{8542}Thank you, marshal.
{8546}{8627}It'll be a pleasure|drinking to your health.
{8631}{8688}Follow me!
{8715}{8766}Well, that was pretty funny, Jim.
{8770}{8831}But if you think I'm gonna ante up|for all the beer...
{8835}{8888}...that hippopotamus|of a sergeant can drink...
{8892}{8972}...between now and the time you leave,|you got two more things coming.
{8976}{9053}- You're up for re-election, aren't you?|- Sergeant Posey can't vote.
{9057}{9112}I bet he can't even make|his mark on the ballot.
{9116}{9180}- What about yourself? Want a beer?|- Yeah, sure.
{9184}{9258}I'll take this one. Cheers.
{9337}{9385}Now, Ward.
{9398}{9442}Ward, come here.
{9447}{9497}Oh, it's you, Mr. McCabe.
{9501}{9538}Was you calling my name?
{9543}{9578}Yeah, yeah.
{9596}{9662}I told you to take those drunks|over to the courthouse.
{9667}{9729}Yes, sir, Mr. McCabe,|that's what you told me...
{9733}{9813}...and that's what I done,|didn't I, fellers?
{9826}{9904}But it wasn't no use. No use at all.
{9908}{9955}Was it, fellers?
{10018}{10114}Well, now, Ward,|why wasn't it any use?
{10118}{10196}- Or am I supposed to guess?|- No, sir, Mr. McCabe.
{10200}{10295}Not that it calls for much guessing,|and that's a true fact.
{10299}{10339}Well, what it comes down to...
{10343}{10407}...is that the judge hisself|was drunk last night...
{10411}{10468}...and never even showed up|in court today.
{10476}{10541}And so as I see it,|they ain't but one thing to do...
{10545}{10611}...and that's just march|these fellers back to the jail...
{10615}{10722}...until the judge sobers up enough|to fine them legal and proper.
{10729}{10776}Now, come on, you fellers. Hurry up.
{10780}{10833}- One, two...|- Ward.
{10868}{10912}Turn them loose.
{10954}{10998}Now, you fellers listen to me.
{11002}{11117}By orders of Marshal McCabe,|I'm a-turning you loose.
{11124}{11171}Go on, you're loose!
{11175}{11271}You ain't turning us loose without|buying us a beer, are you, marshal?
{11275}{11409}You fellas don't mind drinking with|gamblers and fort soldiers, do you?
{11441}{11533}All right, Ward, buy them a beer|and point them toward home.
{11563}{11613}Let's go, boys.
{11732}{11778}Belle?
{11782}{11853}- Look who's here.|- Hello.
{11895}{11950}Guth, how many times|have I told you...
{11954}{12027}...I don't even wanna look|at a man before 5:00.
{12031}{12080}Out! Outside, both of you.
{12084}{12170}Oh, now, Belle, honey, all we want|is just a... All we want is...
{12175}{12252}You can have anything you want|out on the veranda.
{12256}{12350}Well, that's a pretty broad statement.|That takes in a lot of territory, Belle.
{12354}{12422}Lieutenant Gary, I have nothing|against you or the Army.
{12426}{12471}Well, I sincerely hope not, ma'am.
{12475}{12517}Ma'am?!
{12521}{12567}- What am I, your maiden aunt?|- No, ma'am.
{12571}{12614}- Call me Mrs. Aragon.|- Mrs. Aragon.
{12618}{12647}- Call me Belle.|- Belle.
{12651}{12699}Call me madam|if you're tired of living...
{12703}{12778}...but don't call me ma'am.|- No, ma'am.
{12841}{12900}And don't brush|that dust off in here.
{12904}{12939}Excuse me. I'm sorry, ma'am.
{12943}{12995}If you give me a broom,|I could sweep it up.
{12999}{13082}- Never mind. Never mind.|- It'd just take a second.
{13106}{13166}Well, what will you have?
{13170}{13221}What he could use most is a bath.
{13225}{13285}Now, don't keep saying|things like that to me.
{13292}{13378}I'm sorry, that's one service|we don't provide.
{13382}{13435}Not that it doesn't|have its possibilities.
{13482}{13549}- Beer suit you?|- You read my mind.
{13570}{13670}With most men|that's not too difficult.
{13679}{13739}And not too interesting either.
{13753}{13808}I can tell when a man|walks through that door...
{13812}{13874}...whether he prefers|blonds or brunettes...
{13878}{13928}...drinks whiskey or beer...
{13932}{13992}...plays blackjack or poker...
{13996}{14103}...is a cheapskate or a high roller.|- Is that a fact?
{14107}{14203}Well, how do you peg old Jim here?|Oh, excuse me.
{14235}{14307}- Beer, blonds and solitaire.|- Solitaire, that's me.
{14311}{14371}And that'll be four bits, Guth.|He hasn't got a dime.
{14375}{14436}You called it. I haven't got a dime.
{14440}{14494}Except I'm not so sure|about blonds.
{14513}{14552}No man ever is.
{14583}{14616}- That's true.|- Well, Jim...
{14620}{14673}...what brings you to town?
{14726}{14759}Orders.
{14763}{14910}Well, sure. I didn't think you'd ridden|40 miles for fresh air and sunshine.
{14920}{15013}My orders are|to accompany you to Fort Grant.
{15018}{15066}- Accompany me?|- That's right.
{15070}{15156}And I'm to use any means|short of handcu...
{15167}{15228}Any means short of handcuffing you|to persuade you...
{15232}{15278}...to accept the major's invitation.
{15282}{15338}And if you don't accept,|I will handcuff you.
{15342}{15416}Sit down, Belle, join us.
{15510}{15574}What, has there been|a murder out at the fort or...?
{15616}{15671}Somebody run off|with the sutler's wife?
{15675}{15723}- Nope.|- Why not?
{15727}{15784}- It wouldn't be a case of stealing?|- No.
{15788}{15839}What soldier's got anything|worth stealing?
{15843}{15917}- That's very true.|- No. I can't agree with that at all.
{15921}{15998}- You're... You're not gonna tell me?|- No, I'm not gonna tell you.
{16036}{16095}Well, I don't know, Jim.|That's an awful long ride.
{16099}{16140}Forty miles. You know, that's...
{16145}{16194}No, no, that's not so far.
{16198}{16304}And I have my duties here|to think of.
{16333}{16409}McCabe, I don't put|my foot down often.
{16414}{16476}And that's one of the things|I like about you, Belle.
{16480}{16507}Just one of the things.
{16511}{16587}But it's a very rare quality in a woman,|and I admire you for it.
{16591}{16639}What time did you say|we were gonna leave?
{16643}{16690}- Three o'clock.|- Three o'clock. Fine.
{16695}{16772}Oh, Belle, get the cook|to build me a steak, will you?
{16776}{16844}And well-done this time.|Not raw like it was last night.
{16848}{16896}You didn't eat here last night.
{16900}{16959}Or the night before.
{16963}{17025}Well, come to think of it,|I didn't, did I?
{17029}{17120}No. No, that's right,|I guess I didn't.
{17205}{17272}Detail, ho!
{17405}{17444}Fall out for water.
{17448}{17531}- Fifteen minutes.|- Fifteen minutes!
{17897}{17932}It's harder than my saddle.
{17936}{18012}You're in great shape,|sitting on that porch.
{18097}{18206}You know, I still can't figure it out.
{18280}{18358}I can't figure it out. No fuss.
{18375}{18421}No argument.
{18425}{18498}What made you decide|to come along?
{18516}{18561}Ride all night|on some wild goose chase.
{18565}{18629}I'll tell you this, you didn't|decide me to come along.
{18633}{18694}- I'll tell you that.|- I didn't figure I did.
{18735}{18815}Those things come one in a box?
{18819}{18901}- Don't you ever buy your own cigars?|- Sure. I bought two last payday.
{18905}{18962}- That was three months ago.|- Here.
{18966}{19009}Thanks a lot.
{19118}{19152}Hey, I got a match.
{19156}{19233}Gee, I'm surprised|you can afford matches.
{19242}{19299}I can handle that, all right.
{19402}{19452}Why did you come?
{19474}{19514}Well...
{19534}{19648}If you must know, it was mostly|to get away from Belle.
{19654}{19700}Belle? Why?
{19704}{19793}- I thought you two were kind of:|- I know, I know, I know.
{19835}{19955}Well, to be completely|ungentlemanly about it...
{19959}{20026}l... Not that I ever pretended|to be otherwise.
{20030}{20073}- we were, we were.
{20077}{20117}That's what I heard.
{20121}{20162}And...
{20202}{20289}...just lately she started|calling me "Guth."
{20305}{20339}I noticed that.
{20343}{20436}Guth. The first time I heard it I thought|she'd got something stuck in her teeth.
{20440}{20537}Guth, Guth, Guth. But she didn't|have anything stuck in her teeth.
{20542}{20621}It was in her craw...
{20633}{20704}...and a few nights ago she got it out.
{20729}{20780}Yeah, go ahead. What happened?
{20784}{20857}Well, that's not a subject you can|discuss in mixed company...
{20861}{20949}...especially when|one of the parties is...
{20953}{21003}Matrimony.
{21011}{21077}- No.|- Matrimony.
{21081}{21138}Holy smoke. Matrimony.
{21142}{21277}And, of course, in this case,|when one of the parties is sort of...
{21281}{21406}You know, she carries a stiletto|right there in her garter.
{21410}{21436}I know.
{21440}{21526}And we were sitting|around the place talking...
{21551}{21590}How do you know?
{21594}{21650}Well, you just told me.
{21685}{21778}Say, she actually proposed, huh?
{21782}{21838}- You didn't know about that before?|- About what?
{21842}{21887}About the stiletto?
{21891}{21976}How would I know|about that before? Come on.
{21980}{22049}What do you mean?|Did she propose? No.
{22053}{22118}She didn't, if you mean|getting down on one knee.
{22122}{22178}She didn't do that.
{22182}{22254}You have to give her credit|for more animal cunning than that.
{22258}{22314}No, no. As I...
{22351}{22413}As I remember the approach...
{22417}{22477}...it was that she didn't see|why I was satisfied...
{22481}{22526}...with just 10 percent of her take...
{22530}{22624}...when she was willing|to go for fifty-fifty.
{22656}{22751}You mean to tell me you're getting|10 percent of Madam Aragon's place?
{22755}{22828}- Don't tell me you didn't know that.|- I didn't know about that.
{22832}{22880}I get 10 percent of everything|in Tascosa.
{22884}{22922}Holy crimanetta.
{22926}{22983}What? This goes along|with the job of marshal.
{22987}{23039}- You're a dirt...|- It's no secret about it.
{23043}{23101}- You're a dirty thief, McCabe.|- Everybody knows it.
{23105}{23142}Wait a minute.
{23167}{23247}You don't think I could live|on the marshal's salary, do you?
{23251}{23336}- A measly $100 a month, Jim?|- Well, that's 20 more than I get.
{23340}{23434}I know, but look...|Look at you.
{23438}{23514}Look at you. Jim, Jim.
{23525}{23624}You're a man of simple wants.
{23629}{23680}I just require a little more, that's all.
{23684}{23771}- Oh, come on, that's a lot of hogwash.|- Horses are watered, sir!
{23775}{23847}All right, Posey.|The men refill their canteens?
{23851}{23932}Well, the men did,|but I didn't notice you refilling yours.
{23936}{23979}That's right. I'm afraid I haven't.
{23983}{24014}There you go again.
{24018}{24080}Just when I think I got you|trained real good...
{24084}{24139}...you go forgetting things like now.
{24143}{24205}It's just downright|discouraging, lieutenant.
{24209}{24293}I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sergeant.|It won't happen again.
{24297}{24363}Hey, Slim! Fill mine up|while you're at it, will you?
{24367}{24439}- Now, see here, civilian...|- Posey. Posey.
{24443}{24502}Marshal McCabe's our guest.
{24506}{24565}He's afraid of getting|his fancy boots wet.
{24569}{24619}And me with my feet killing...
{24623}{24686}Well, there goes another man|with simple wants.
{24690}{24726}Eight beers.
{25651}{25709}There he is,|the blessing of the Lord.
{25713}{25786}Clay, Pete, come here.
{26155}{26187}{y:i}William.
{26191}{26234}William!
{26238}{26283}- William!|- Anna!
{26288}{26350}Anna!
{26610}{26678}You sure seem to be popular|around here.
{26682}{26763}The least you could do is tip your hat|or take a bow, make a speech.
{26767}{26800}Yeah, I might.
{26804}{26873}Except it's you they're cheering.
{26890}{26946}- Me?|- Yep.
{27098}{27131}You'll find him.
{27135}{27231}- You'll find my Toby!|- Here now, Mary. Now, Mary.
{27790}{27877}Well, he's here.
{27892}{27947}Does he know what he's here for?
{27951}{28014}That's not my department, sir.
{28044}{28130}Well, maybe we can|make it your department.
{28171}{28222}Yes, sir.
{28305}{28353}- Mrs. Frazer.|- Welcome back, Jim.
{28357}{28390}Thank you.
{28403}{28451}He'll find our son.
{28455}{28509}I know he will.
{28526}{28583}I could see a light...
{28587}{28663}...shining around his head.
{28667}{28727}Just like a halo.
{28759}{28817}You mean to tell me|you dragged me 40 miles...
{28821}{28862}...all the way out here, for that?
{28866}{28913}I did not drag you, Marshal McCabe.
{28917}{28975}You had reasons of your own|for coming, remember?
{28980}{29016}All right, Jim. All right.
{29020}{29098}Let's just say that I got my own|good reasons for going back.
{29102}{29167}- lf I could catch a few hours sleep...|- Sleep?
{29171}{29226}Could you sleep knowing|what a disappointment...
{29230}{29274}...this is going to be|to those people?
{29278}{29319}I'll sleep like a baby.
{29323}{29383}- I'll be happy to prove it.|- Now, wait. Take it easy.
{29387}{29450}You saw how those people looked|at you when we rode in.
{29454}{29488}I sure did. I sure did.
{29492}{29562}Now that you explained to me|why they looked at me like that...
{29566}{29607}...I can't say I'm too impressed.
{29611}{29688}That was the same kind of a look|the Romans gave the Christians...
{29692}{29746}...just before they turned|the lions loose.
{29750}{29820}All right. But you've had dealings|with Quanah Parker before.
{29824}{29896}He knows you. He trusts you.
{29919}{29991}Quanah Parker|wouldn't trust his mother.
{29995}{30077}Of course I've had dealings with him|with horses and hides.
{30081}{30110}A little gold one time.
{30114}{30187}- Weapons?|- Yeah, yeah, a few weapons.
{30191}{30270}But I'll tell you this, I never once|rode out of that camp of his...
{30274}{30373}...without having the feeling that I'd|left something important behind me.
{30377}{30420}Like my scalp, for instance.
{30424}{30496}Would money influence your decision?
{30539}{30614}Yeah. Yeah, might.
{30618}{30682}I'd be exceeding my authority...
{30687}{30764}...but I'm prepared|to enrol you as a chief scout.
{30774}{30836}The pay is that of a first lieutenant.
{30869}{30945}- Eighty dollars a month?|- And found.
{31035}{31080}Well, now, major...
{31084}{31133}Now, I'll tell you what I'll do...
{31137}{31199}...just to show you|my heart's in the right place.
{31203}{31292}Now, there's 100,|2, 3... There's $400.
{31296}{31387}Good Yankee currency. That'll buy you|five chief scouts for a month.
{31392}{31458}Now, you tell them just exactly|what you told me:
{31462}{31546}That all they have to do is to ride|into Quanah Parker's camp...
{31550}{31611}...and tell him they want all|the white prisoners...
{31615}{31682}...his Comanches have captured|in the last 15, 20 years.
{31686}{31760}You get any takers, you can pay it|out of that 400.
{31767}{31799}No, go on, take it.
{31803}{31880}I'll be riding out here in a month or so.|I'll pick up what's left.
{31916}{32001}Mr. Gary, perhaps Marshal McCabe|can share your quarters...
{32005}{32113}...until he's rested sufficiently to return|to his more lucrative duties in Tascosa.
{32117}{32163}- Fine.|- Yes, sir.
{32167}{32239}I know Madam Aragon|will be glad to see him back.
{32243}{32298}- Won't she, Guth?|- Hell, now, Jim...
{32302}{32398}- Just what is your price, McCabe?|- lf you'd call him Guth, he'll shave...
{32403}{32496}I don't know what this private joke's|about, but it's gone far enough.
{32534}{32636}Just how much do you think|human lives are worth, McCabe?
{32640}{32706}Whatever the market will bear.|No more, no less.
{32710}{32770}I've told you what I could pay.|That's all I can do.
{32784}{32842}Well, I believe you, major.
{32851}{32890}I believe you.
{32894}{32957}- So I'll take it.|- Sit down.
{32961}{33013}- Well, I'd prefer, sir...|- Sit down!
{33017}{33078}You understand,|this is just a matter of principal.
{33089}{33168}I'll make up the balance|from that bunch of sooners out there.
{33172}{33223}What balance?
{33228}{33331}- I figure it's worth about $500.|- What?
{33335}{33425}Five hundred dollars a head|for each captive I bring in.
{33429}{33487}If this is another joke,|I want to tell you...
{33491}{33547}...I regard it in extremely bad taste.
{33551}{33603}And you can consider that|my lowest offer.
{33608}{33692}- And you, sir, can go to the devil.|- All right.
{33697}{33735}Suit yourself.
{33747}{33812}Suit yourself, but just remember this:
{33816}{33888}Now, you can't send a troop|into Comanche territory...
{33892}{33939}...without breaking the peace treaty.
{33943}{34013}One false move, and you have|another Indian war on your hand.
{34017}{34090}- Wouldn't look good on your record.|- Never mind my record.
{34094}{34174}They'd bust you, major.|They'd bust you, and you know it.
{34178}{34252}In the meantime, you got congressmen|breathing down your neck...
{34256}{34314}...to do something about|those constituents there.
{34319}{34419}Now, what you need is a civilian to pull|the Army's chestnuts out of the fire...
{34423}{34494}...and you want me to work|for Army pay. Oh, no.
{34499}{34564}Those sodbusters out there|haven't $500 between them.
{34568}{34661}They've begged, borrowed, and|sold everything to get this far.
{34665}{34737}That's my problem,|that's not your problem. My problem.
{34741}{34809}Now, you just give me three hours|out there in that camp...
{34813}{34878}...and if there's any hard cash...|- He'll smell it out.
{34882}{34916}That's correct.
{34920}{34975}That's... I'll smell it out.
{34979}{35052}Now, are you gonna make|the decision for them, major...
{35056}{35136}...or are you gonna let them make up|their own minds like they should?
{35147}{35213}I don't know how the word got out|that I'd sent for you...
{35217}{35244}...but somehow it did.
{35248}{35292}And they've been|expecting a messiah...
{35296}{35364}...a Moses come to deliver|their children from bondage.
{35370}{35418}And I've got to send them you.
{35422}{35461}Get him out of here.
{35465}{35530}And leave the door open|to let in a little fresh air.
{35534}{35594}A pleasure to do business|with you, major.
{35599}{35637}Pleasure.
{35795}{35854}They burned up the whole place.
{35858}{35929}The boy, they kill.|We find him the next day.
{35933}{36008}But the little girl, she was just gone.
{36017}{36066}- How old was she?|- Freda?
{36070}{36134}Freda was 9 year old.
{36138}{36197}- That would make her 16 now.|- Yeah.
{36228}{36306}Yeah. The fourth of August, 16.
{36311}{36353}Go home, Mr. Knudsen.
{36371}{36421}Go home.
{36470}{36511}Give it up.
{36515}{36589}Go on back to Minnesota,|forget you ever had a daughter.
{36593}{36631}Forget? Forget l...?
{36636}{36693}The Comanche...
{36720}{36765}The Comanches mate|their women early.
{36769}{36807}If your daughter's still alive...
{36811}{36872}...she's probably got a couple|half-breed kids by now.
{36876}{36958}Oh, come on, McCabe,|that's a hell of a thing to say.
{36965}{37034}That don't makes no matter to me.
{37038}{37070}No, by golly.
{37074}{37126}She's still my little girl Freda.
{37130}{37183}I don't go back without her.
{37199}{37260}Please, mister, listen to me.
{37266}{37322}For seven years we wait...
{37327}{37384}...Mama and me. Wait for the Army.
{37388}{37463}The Army to beat them,|them dirty devils.
{37467}{37536}So we can come back|here again for Freda.
{37540}{37607}Seven long years we work and save.
{37611}{37734}I got $285, mister, for my Freda.
{37821}{37898}All right,|take the description, Mr. Wringle.
{37902}{37940}All right, Ole.
{37944}{37996}What colour was Freda's eyes?
{38000}{38053}Eyes was blue.
{38079}{38122}Colour of her hair?
{38128}{38168}Hair was yellow.
{38172}{38230}Yellow like corn silk.
{38235}{38283}Yellow like gold, it was.
{38287}{38392}Yeah, just like gold, $285 worth.
{38399}{38457}You don't need me for this.
{38547}{38622}Form your square!
{38696}{38760}Ready your partner!
{38764}{38796}Now corners off.
{38949}{39060}Of all the stupid...|Wait, you're breaking everything.
{39081}{39147}I give up! I give up!
{39174}{39230}Well, now, that's more like it,|Miss Marty.
{39234}{39309}Back home, I usually come a-calling|for my gal at the front door.
{39313}{39364}May I have the honour|of the first dance?
{39368}{39435}I'm claiming the first dance, Ortho.
{39439}{39485}Now, fair play, Greely.
{39508}{39571}I get to get the first dance,|Miss Marty.
{39575}{39620}You do?
{39661}{39734}Come on, honey,|I'll help you down.
{39925}{39974}Good evening, miss.
{39982}{40057}Well, boys, looks like|an early winter.
{40061}{40121}- You all right?|- Of course she's all right.
{40125}{40169}Just having us some fun is all.
{40173}{40237}You said, "Good evening,"|now you can say good night.
{40241}{40314}- Greely Clegg!|- Well, he knows the rules.
{40318}{40385}Ain't no soldiers allowed|in this camp after sundown.
{40389}{40477}- Sorry, but I'm afraid I'm here on duty.|- You ought to be ashamed.
{40481}{40545}After the lieutenant brought|Mr. McCabe here to help us.
{40550}{40603}We ain't asking for no help...
{40607}{40665}...McCabe's nor the Army's.
{40669}{40752}Just to be let do|the thing we come here to do.
{40759}{40831}But no. Mustn't rile the Comanches.
{40835}{40879}Sit tight, they say.
{40883}{40928}While you Yankee blue-bellies...
{40933}{41015}...go parading up and down|as big as you please...
{41019}{41088}...we're sitting here waiting|for you to find one man.
{41096}{41131}One man, mind you.
{41135}{41216}And he's supposed to do|what all us put together couldn't do.
{41220}{41253}Good evening, miss.
{41257}{41311}How much is he|paying you, Yankee...
{41315}{41407}...out of what he's claiming|to ransom our kinfolk?
{41557}{41654}There's only one way I'd like|to answer that question...
{41658}{41728}...but I'd have to be|out of uniform and off duty.
{41732}{41786}Right now, I'm neither.
{41824}{41869}By the way...
{41886}{41984}...if you'd like to repeat that question,|be at the post armoury at 4 tomorrow.
{41989}{42061}- I'll be there.|- And I'll be off duty.
{42065}{42125}Of all the contemptible,|mean-minded...
{42129}{42185}...ungrateful men I've ever met.
{42190}{42276}There you be, Greely.|You know, that fits you to a T.
{42280}{42355}Reckon now that means I get|the first dance, huh, Miss Marty?
{42359}{42413}Go wash your faces.
{42417}{42502}And your mouths too. Go on, scoot!
{44007}{44039}Now, Martha...
{44052}{44111}...stop torturing yourself.
{44116}{44152}Why don't you let me have that?
{44156}{44221}Let me give it away.|Or better yet, destroy it.
{44486}{44531}What did Mr. McCabe say?
{44535}{44603}Nothing much. Mostly, he listened.
{44630}{44672}I thought you'd be at the dance.
{44696}{44732}I'll tell you what.
{44736}{44787}You put on that pretty pink dress|of yours...
{44791}{44839}...and we'll go to the dance together.
{44930}{44990}It'd be good for you|to have some fun...
{44994}{45052}...mix more with the young people.
{45106}{45163}I'd rather not, Father.
{45265}{45327}Well, I think I'll turn in.
{45403}{45484}- Good night, dear.|- Good night, Father.
{45498}{45544}I won't have those people exploited...
{45548}{45626}...milked of every last dollar|to line McCabe's pockets.
{45630}{45693}He'll get chief scout's pay|and not one cent more.
{45697}{45755}- I thought you agreed to...|- I agreed to nothing.
{45763}{45810}The man's a scoundrel.
{45814}{45863}I'll use him and kick him out.
{45870}{45929}Mr. Gary, I'm placing you|on detached duty.
{45933}{45989}You'll take those settlers|as far as Oak Creek...
{45993}{46039}...the limit of our patrol area.
{46043}{46099}- Sergeant Posey will accompany you.|- Yes, sir.
{46107}{46172}Posey will remain with orders|to bring them back here...
{46176}{46221}...if you don't return in three days.
{46225}{46299}- Is that clear?|- Well, no. Not entirely.
{46303}{46338}Return from where?
{46345}{46413}I'm ordering you to volunteer|to go with McCabe...
{46417}{46455}...and meet with Quanah Parker.
{46463}{46512}Well, what about the treaty?
{46517}{46555}The department's orders?
{46563}{46660}They can scarcely apply|to a deserter out of uniform.
{46669}{46767}If you don't return, mister, that's|exactly what will show on your record.
{46771}{46876}If I don't return, it won't make much|difference what shows on my record.
{46887}{46953}When am I ordered to desert, sir?
{46958}{47007}I don't know|what you're talking about.
{47012}{47058}Get out of here.
{47065}{47134}Thank you, sir.
{47155}{47204}Good evening, Jim.|Where are you going?
{47208}{47256}To desert.
{48231}{48294}Hey, isn't that pretty heavy?
{48307}{48344}Better let me help you.
{48348}{48387}Oh, it's not too heavy.
{48391}{48445}Looks heavy enough from here.
{48491}{48530}There.
{49044}{49088}That's our wagon over there.
{49092}{49127}All right.
{49169}{49215}Oh, say...
{49220}{49284}...you picked a good spot too.
{49288}{49332}Out of the wind.
{49336}{49433}Far enough from the crick so you|won't get too many mosquitoes.
{49437}{49526}Near a dead tree|that'll keep you in firewood.
{49537}{49595}You're an old trail hand.
{49702}{49798}Well, maybe not too old.
{49807}{49890}Have you been in the Army|very long, sir?
{49894}{49976}The name's Jim. Jim Gary.
{49985}{50055}Yeah, about nine years.
{50132}{50178}What's the matter?
{50228}{50307}It was just nine years ago|that my brother was captured.
{50313}{50350}Oh, I was up north then.
{50354}{50450}- Montana territory. I just got out...|- It was my fault, you know.
{50460}{50540}- What do you mean?|- I was supposed to look after him.
{50544}{50619}When the Indians came, I ran and hid.
{50626}{50677}He was only 8 years old.
{50714}{50748}How old were you?
{50793}{50847}Thirteen, I think.
{50852}{50882}Yes.
{50892}{50947}Where was your father|and the others?
{50963}{51053}Hadn't been any Indians within 50|miles. He'd gone to visit a neighbour.
{51057}{51093}They weren't even touched.
{51109}{51157}It was a small raiding party, I guess.
{51173}{51222}I was still hiding|when Father came home...
{51226}{51266}...too frightened to come out...
{51270}{51326}...after I knew the Comanches|had ridden away.
{51355}{51404}Well, it...
{51426}{51469}It sounds to me, Miss...?
{51480}{51514}Marty.
{51519}{51577}Sounds to me, Miss Marty...
{51583}{51657}...like there wasn't anything|you could have done anyway.
{51686}{51760}Except get captured yourself.
{51839}{51893}I have a picture of him.
{51928}{52025}Do you think you could get Mr. McCabe|to look at it before he goes?
{52052}{52105}I'll make sure he does.
{52123}{52166}I'll get it.
{52309}{52373}Real Pennsylvania rye.
{52377}{52422}If you don't say|that's good whiskey...
{52426}{52480}...my name isn't Wringle,|Henry J. Wringle.
{52562}{52617}That's Henry J. all right.
{52621}{52659}Yes, sir.
{52663}{52727}- Now, what about this boy of yours?|- No, no, no.
{52739}{52803}Not my boy, my wife's.
{52807}{52848}By her first husband.
{52852}{52954}See, I promised her I'd do everything|I could to find that boy of hers.
{52960}{53043}In fact, l... I had to give her my word|on it before she'd marry me.
{53055}{53097}Well, that seems natural enough.
{53101}{53163}Oh, yes, yes, it's natural.
{53168}{53262}But it certainly isn't practical.|Not when you've got a business to run.
{53266}{53313}Now, this journey.
{53317}{53364}Why, this thing could|go on for months.
{53368}{53433}All these people setting|these camps up every night...
{53437}{53468}...eight, nine miles... No.
{53472}{53536}I just haven't got|that kind of time to waste.
{53540}{53579}Well, maybe you'll be lucky.
{53583}{53620}McCabe...
{53624}{53699}...l've always been a man|that made his own luck.
{53703}{53759}And if I'm any judge of character...
{53763}{53808}...so have you.
{53849}{53945}You know, my wife hasn't seen|that boy of hers since he was 2.
{53953}{54005}Be 17 now.
{54016}{54057}McCabe...
{54062}{54157}...I will guarantee that you|could bring in any boy that age...
{54161}{54214}...tell my wife that it was her son...
{54233}{54292}...she'd accept him without question.
{54296}{54354}And then you could get back|to your business.
{54374}{54448}Then I could get back|to my business.
{54462}{54513}I'd be willing to give 1000...
{54517}{54594}- Five hundred dollars for...|- You said 1000.
{54627}{54703}All right, I'll make it 1000.
{54709}{54822}And, McCabe, any boy would do,|you know?
{54848}{54905}Well, he'd have a good home,|get an education.
{54909}{54983}- What's wrong with that?|- Not a thing.
{54992}{55038}Not a thing, Mr. Wringle.
{55043}{55103}Maybe in time, he'd grow up|to be a man like you.
{55107}{55143}- You bet your life.|- All right.
{55147}{55177}- It's a deal.|- It's a deal.
{55181}{55323}- Fine, thanks a lot.|- I'll take the keg, to bind it, huh?
{55327}{55379}All right, you can go...
{55383}{55448}- Hello, lieutenant.|- Interrupting something?
{55453}{55555}Oh, no, no, no. I was just wishing|Mr. McCabe good luck.
{55570}{55631}- Good luck, McCabe.|- Yes, sir.
{55635}{55696}Yes, sir, Mr. Wringle.
{55714}{55761}Yes, sir.
{55765}{55806}That was Mr. Wringle.
{55810}{55889}- Happy fella, isn't he?|- Mr. Wringle.
{55894}{55955}You know, that's the trouble|with the world today.
{55959}{55997}There are too many Wringles.
{56001}{56058}Why, they're just all Wringles|all over the place.
{56062}{56160}There are too many Wringles in the|bed, there are Wringles in your shirts...
{56164}{56244}...there are Wringles in your face.|There are too many Wringles.
{56248}{56305}You better give me this keg.|You've had enough.
{56309}{56380}We're pulling out of here|in the morning, you know.
{56384}{56444}- We?|- We.
{56451}{56525}What, was this Frazer's idea|or was it your idea?
{56529}{56589}Major Frazer. Direct orders.
{56593}{56655}- Doesn't he trust me?|- Who does?
{56659}{56707}Does he think|I ought to have a chaperone?
{56711}{56753}- Probably. You need one.|- I need one?
{56757}{56817}I got enough trouble trying|to keep my own scalp...
{56821}{56882}...without having to try|and look after your scalp.
{56886}{56934}Look, you don't have|to worry about me.
{56938}{57004}I can take care of myself.|There's no point in arguing.
{57008}{57066}There's no point in arguing.|I'm going with you.
{57070}{57130}- You've seen very few Indians...|- Now, wait a minute.
{57134}{57220}- When were you planning to pull out?|- I was planning to pull out at sunup.
{57224}{57296}All right, change your plans|and pull out a little before.
{57300}{57356}I don't want people|to know I've gone with you.
{57360}{57394}Yes, sir!
{57398}{57455}- Yes, sir! Lieutenant, yes, sir!|- Oh, cut it out!
{57459}{57519}- Is there any other orders?|- Stop acting like a fool.
{57523}{57599}Is there any other orders?|If there are no further orders...
{57603}{57687}- Knock it off, will you!|- Is it all right if my friend and I go out?
{57692}{57740}And I go someplace|where it's quiet...
{57744}{57805}...and drink to all|the Wringles in the world?
{57809}{57847}Look, cut it out, Guthrie.
{57851}{57896}We've been friends too long.
{57900}{57968}Whatever gave you that idea?
{58130}{58178}- Hiya, Posey.|- Evening, sir.
{58182}{58265}- Did you have a good supper?|- Oh, yeah, fine. You seen McCabe?
{58270}{58365}Oh, him. He's over at|the old Hickman place with a keg.
{58369}{58399}That figures.
{58403}{58469}There's some coffee over there|if you'd like to join Dad.
{58473}{58544}- Well, thank you, ma'am.|- I'll see you.
{58666}{58715}- Well...|- Oh, no, no, no.
{58720}{58797}Now, if you two want to stroll down|lover's lane holding hands...
{58801}{58869}...you can do it someplace else,|because this is my room.
{58876}{58928}I'm sorry,|we didn't mean to startle you.
{58932}{59015}Well, the least you could've done is|knock, because this is my room.
{59019}{59115}Now, wait a minute. She wanted to ask|you something special before you left.
{59119}{59159}- Is that so?|- Yeah, that's so.
{59163}{59203}This picture.
{59259}{59336}It's my brother,|the one we're looking for.
{59353}{59427}Of course, he was very young there,|but it's all I have...
{59431}{59477}...and I thought it might help you.
{59537}{59601}How long has it been|since that picture was taken?
{59614}{59653}At least 12 years.
{59658}{59704}I think he'd be about 17 now.
{59708}{59753}About 17?
{59761}{59822}About 17.
{59844}{59961}You... You give me a picture of|a curly headed 5-year-old kid...
{59965}{60005}...with velvet knee-britches...
{60009}{60075}...and you think it'll help, huh?
{60079}{60188}Would you like me to tell you|what this little angel looks like now?
{60192}{60258}- Come on, Guthrie, cut it out.|- No, no, no. Let her know.
{60262}{60319}It's about time somebody|in this camp knows.
{60324}{60401}Here. Here. Now, let me...|Let me tell you something.
{60406}{60447}Do you...?
{60452}{60538}That kid has braids|down to here now.
{60542}{60596}Stiff, stinking braids...
{60600}{60643}...filled with buffalo grease.
{60647}{60708}And he's got a scar there,|right in his shoulder...
{60712}{60787}...where they stuck the pins|right in through his flesh.
{60791}{60866}Then took some rawhide ropes|and hung him up like that...
{60870}{60946}...so he'd sort of dangle like that|until the kid tore himself...
{60950}{61030}...off these pins|just to prove he's a man.
{61036}{61082}He forgot his English.
{61087}{61136}He just grunts Comanche now.
{61140}{61175}Just grunts.
{61183}{61224}And he's killed.
{61228}{61300}And he's taken scalps,|white man's scalps.
{61307}{61374}And given the chance,|sister, he'd rape you.
{61378}{61433}- I told you to cut it out!|- Now you... You hush.
{61437}{61544}- I'm not gonna hush. Just shut up!|- I'm talking to the lady. You hush.
{61548}{61625}When he's finished, he'd trade you off|to one of the other bucks...
{61629}{61682}...for a good knife or a bad rifle.
{61687}{61774}Now, is that what you want me|to bring back to you, huh?
{61825}{61881}Is that what you want?
{61905}{61962}Why, you no...
{61971}{62064}Why didn't you knock her down and|kick her teeth in while you were at it?
{62068}{62109}How about a snort before you go?
{62113}{62158}Hey, Jim.
{62198}{62235}Jim!
{62244}{62318}- Jim!|- Marty. Marty, listen.
{62325}{62387}That was the whiskey talking,|not McCabe.
{62391}{62425}So forget it, please.
{62429}{62466}Put it right out of your mind.
{62481}{62570}No, it wasn't the whiskey.|It was the truth.
{62584}{62616}I'm a fool for...
{62620}{62715}For crying over someone who|died nine years ago.
{62753}{62827}But I can't help it.
{63121}{63173}You leave her be.
{63177}{63229}Go on back to camp, Miss Marty.
{63233}{63334}I'll go and come when I please,|Mr. Clegg, and with whom I please.
{63339}{63435}Well, then you'll oblige me|by stepping aside.
{63454}{63500}Now, Yank...
{63504}{63580}...I know this ain't|what you call your armoury...
{63584}{63648}...and you got on your soldier suit|and all that...
{63652}{63749}...but I don't reckon hugging my gal|comes under the heading of duty.
{63753}{63821}I'm not your girl,|never have been nor will be.
{63825}{63890}Well, that remains to be solved.
{63894}{63974}Now, why don't you and me|just step out here a piece...
{63978}{64020}...and we'll get this thing started.
{64024}{64080}Get away, you stupid idiot.
{64084}{64141}- He shoved you, Greely.|- I know he shoved me.
{64146}{64180}I know he done it. I seen it.
{64184}{64239}- You fellas gonna fight?|- Yes, Mr. McCabe.
{64243}{64272}Let me hold your coat.
{64276}{64354}- Here, give me your coat.|- Much obliged.
{64419}{64462}What are we looking for?
{64466}{64558}Looking for a chip|for him to knock off my shoulder.
{64565}{64629}Well, here, try him.
{64678}{64720}Thank you.
{64767}{64844}- Hey, hey. I'll hold that.|- Thank you.
{64856}{64930}- Fight fair, Jim. Fight fair.|- McCabe, you keep quiet!
{64934}{64991}I'm telling you, just shut up!|That's all.
{64996}{65073}I dare you to knock that piece|of firewood off my shoulder.
{65078}{65152}Go on, Jim, knock that piece|of firewood off his shoulder.
{65157}{65214}- I'm handling this.|- You stop this and go on home!
{65218}{65277}Marty, you stay over there.|Everything is going...
{65282}{65365}- Knock that piece of firewood off!|- Stay out of this!
{65369}{65427}Why don't you two knotheads go on|back to camp...
{65431}{65473}...and wash up or something.
{65486}{65547}Come on, help me, Ortho! Get up!
{65569}{65630}Jim, you just ain't half trying.
{65698}{65756}Hey, Greely, I've got him!
{65760}{65803}I've got the scissors hold on him.
{65807}{65878}Ortho, it's me. You dumbbell!
{65883}{65932}Mr. McCabe! They're killing him!
{65936}{65979}- It's two against one.|- Two?
{65983}{66044}I thought there were four of them.
{66119}{66177}My leg!
{66198}{66262}- You dumbbell.|- Ma'am.
{66266}{66330}You're... You're obstructing my view.
{66334}{66423}Come on, Jim.|You're going great, Jim.
{66546}{66593}Foul. Jim.
{66597}{66629}Foul.
{66634}{66732}Sergeant Posey! Daddy!|They're killing Mr. Gary.
{66899}{67002}Choke him, Ortho! Choke him|till his eyeballs pop out.
{67017}{67095}Hey, that's my brother|you just poked.
{67384}{67449}I can't swim.
{67491}{67533}Come on, Greely.
{67546}{67607}Oh, you don't have to do that.|Really, it's nothing.
{67611}{67667}This hand is cut.|I've got to put ointment on it.
{67671}{67696}It's just a scratch.
{67700}{67762}Sir, it'd give me pleasure|to take those two tackies...
{67766}{67798}Forget it.
{67802}{67872}They've never been anything|but trouble since we started out.
{68093}{68140}Come on, Posey.
{68162}{68232}- What is it?|- Could be Comanche!
{68265}{68297}What is it?
{68302}{68345}Godless Comanches.
{68349}{68415}- I killed one.|- All right.
{68544}{68609}Mrs. McCandless!
{68631}{68698}Toby!
{68713}{68777}Mr. McCandless, that's your wife!
{68821}{68890}- Hey, wait a minute.|- Toby! It's my little boy!
{68894}{68957}That was the wind you heard,|that's all. Now, come on.
{68962}{69028}Come, baby! Come, Toby!
{69032}{69082}Toby, come to Mama!
{69094}{69157}- My baby!|- Relax.
{69192}{69238}Toby.
{69259}{69327}It was my baby. Oh, Marty, help me.
{69331}{69434}Help me. It's my little boy,|he's across the river. He needs me.
{69438}{69541}The Indians will get him!|He needs me! The Indians!
{69545}{69680}Clegg, if you and those two idiot sons|of yours cause any more trouble...
{69684}{69753}...l'm gonna have you|slapped in irons!
{70278}{70329}Hiya, Guth!
{70388}{70474}Pull up a chair,|have yourself some breakfast.
{70612}{70676}Had mine about an hour ago.
{70805}{70851}Little morning coffee?
{70950}{71013}There's one thing|we ought to get straight, though.
{71042}{71128}From now on, we take turns|doing the cooking.
{71143}{71181}Oh, yeah.
{71202}{71284}Yeah, and there's one thing more|we ought to get straight.
{71302}{71364}From now on, we ride together.
{71387}{71425}Is that clear?
{71500}{71534}Well, it's your scalp.
{71620}{71667}Your scalp.
{71705}{71818}You're crazy fool enough to risk it|for $80 a month, that's your luck, huh.
{71842}{71895}But don't buck me, Jim.
{71899}{71975}Don't buck me. Don't interfere.
{71989}{72064}I'll do the talking,|I'll do the trading, not you.
{72068}{72117}Well, you sure do plenty of talking.
{72127}{72165}That's right.
{72285}{72374}Well, you make lousy coffee,|I'll tell you that for sure.
{72382}{72421}You...?
{72425}{72475}You talk good Comanche, huh?
{72483}{72542}I do all right, don't worry.
{72574}{72619}Well, you better start talking.
{73771}{73833}Remember now, I'll do the talking.
{73989}{74033}Quanah Parker.
{74037}{74086}You know me.
{74352}{74384}Quanah.
{74388}{74434}Quanah, this is my partner here.
{74438}{74525}This is Jim Gary.|He's from up north, Montana way.
{74529}{74605}He's good friend.
{74609}{74668}Brain, big brain.
{74701}{74743}Lie.
{74781}{74842}Soldier. I see him before.
{74990}{75036}Well, you got a good memory.
{75042}{75151}Yeah, I was with Major Frazer last year|when you signed the peace treaty.
{75157}{75234}Now you break treaty.|You come here.
{75239}{75281}No, no. No, I'm not in uniform.
{75285}{75349}You see, my coming here|has nothing to do with the Army.
{75353}{75400}We're here to trade.
{75405}{75477}- Yeah.|- Show him, McCabe.
{75481}{75517}You're still giving the orders?
{75533}{75609}Quanah, I'd like to talk|a little business with you.
{75613}{75719}We've got two pack horses here,|first-class, pretty merchandise.
{75727}{75798}- Oh, you.|- Oh, you.
{77144}{77214}Give me the white men.
{77239}{77310}I give the orders, not you.
{77805}{77862}We'll see who gives the orders.
{77939}{77996}Take them to a lodge.
{78250}{78321}You would have to come along.
{78374}{78438}Why didn't you tell me you'd met|Quanah Parker before?
{78442}{78511}There must have been|50 other officers at that parley.
{78515}{78558}He never even looked in my direction.
{78562}{78609}- Not much.|- No, he didn't.
{78613}{78738}Hey, who was the skinhead out there,|the troublemaker?
{78745}{78812}Stone Calf.|He's head of the Buffalo Shields.
{78816}{78885}They're some kind of a|warrior society.
{78889}{78948}Just for your information,|he claimed our scalps...
{78952}{78992}...for crossing the treaty lines.
{78996}{79083}Put your trust in the Lord,|young man.
{79087}{79156}- That's what I did.|- Who are you?
{79164}{79251}Now? Nakotah's woman.
{79261}{79334}My real name is Hannah.
{79345}{79409}Hannah Clegg.
{79418}{79477}I had a husband once.
{79499}{79553}And two sons.
{79559}{79613}Greely and Ortho.
{79617}{79663}Yes!
{79668}{79717}Do you know? You know my boys?
{79721}{79774}We... We sure do.
{79782}{79822}They're... They're fine boys.
{79826}{79863}Both of them.
{79868}{79906}They're full-grown men now.
{79910}{79982}They've come back|with their father to look for you.
{79986}{80027}Oh, no.
{80031}{80097}No. They must never do that.
{80103}{80150}- Why?|- They must never find me. Never.
{80154}{80225}You'd rather be listed as dead?
{80302}{80357}I am dead.
{80373}{80446}Ma'am, are there any other|white prisoners in camp?
{80533}{80576}Running Wolf.
{80580}{80651}And the girl, Wah-kay-nah.
{80655}{80691}She has two young'uns.
{80695}{80741}No others?
{80808}{80865}Mostly dead.
{80884}{80960}Some sold off in Mexico.
{80980}{81062}- Oh, I gotta go now. I gotta go.|- Mrs. Clegg.
{81079}{81121}I'm sorry.
{81235}{81296}Stone Calf's woman.
{81301}{81375}Stone Calf's woman, she's white.
{81388}{81494}But don't tell them about me.|No, please, don't tell them.
{83027}{83107}Well, I see you've been taking a look|at our merchandise.
{83111}{83252}It is many years since I trade|for glass beads and red flannel.
{83333}{83394}What do you want for these, McCabe?
{83405}{83455}Well, just before we start the trading...
{83459}{83569}...l'd like you to know that I don't enjoy|being treated like a prisoner.
{83577}{83654}I came here of my own free will,|and I want your promise...
{83658}{83744}...that we can leave the same way,|all in one piece.
{83754}{83830}Now, of course, if Stone Calf's|the new head man around here...
{83834}{83881}...maybe I ought to be talking to him.
{83885}{83935}Stone Calf.
{83942}{84052}He still says words over buffalo shield|to turn away bullets.
{84062}{84115}But we know different, don't we?
{84119}{84151}All right.
{84155}{84212}Now that brings up|an interesting question.
{84216}{84276}I understand he has a white wife.|Is that right?
{84280}{84327}One of the captives?
{84379}{84465}As a matter of fact, Quanah, this...|That's the reason we're here.
{84469}{84517}We want to buy back some captives.
{84527}{84612}We want to buy back a boy|named Running Wolf.
{84619}{84705}Want a girl named...|What was the name of that girl?
{84709}{84778}- Wah-kay-nah.|- Wah-kay-nah.
{84787}{84873}We also want to buy back|Stone Calf's woman.
{85019}{85074}Handles real nice, doesn't it?
{85091}{85168}I imagine a repeater like that|would come in mighty handy...
{85172}{85261}...if you ever had to have a showdown|with a troublemaker like Stone Calf.
{85363}{85409}You think it over.
{85424}{85480}Think it over, Quanah.|Take your time.
{85796}{85873}That's Stone Calf, huh?
{85883}{85936}Big medicine.
{86191}{86250}Why am I taken?
{86254}{86313}I send you back to your people.
{86317}{86421}No, I am a Comanche!|No, I'm no white man.
{86489}{86562}- Is he white?|- Boy is white.
{86566}{86611}Wah-kay-nah.
{86803}{86847}What's your name?
{86873}{86952}Is it...? Is it Freda?
{86962}{87006}Freda?
{87022}{87061}Can you speak English?
{87084}{87129}Freda.
{87146}{87198}Don't you remember? Fre...
{87322}{87378}- Freda Knudsen.|- Freda Knudsen.
{87382}{87464}Sixteen the fourth of August.
{87473}{87523}I've had enough of this.|Let's forget it.
{87527}{87587}Yeah, the time to forget it|was before we started.
{87591}{87658}I'm gonna take that kid|back to Henry J. Wringle.
{87662}{87765}All right, squeeze what you can|out of Henry J. Wringle, but she stays.
{87769}{87803}- Wait!|- All right.
{87810}{87902}- You make trade for one more.|- No, no, Quanah.
{87906}{87978}Looks like you're gonna have|to handle Stone Calf yourself.
{87982}{88024}Now, that shouldn't be too hard.
{88028}{88104}- Six more rifles.|- All right, six more rifles. Come on.
{88109}{88152}Come on!
{89026}{89098}You made trade with me, McCabe.
{89112}{89183}- I keep the rifles.|- All right.
{89187}{89263}All right, I'll stick to my end|of the bargain.
{89279}{89380}- You trust me, don't you, Quanah?|- No.
{89661}{89712}Well, who are you?
{89758}{89825}I am Stone Calf's woman.
{89834}{89886}Well, that's no white woman.|She's a squaw.
{89890}{89928}No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
{89932}{89992}No, wait a minute.|That's no Comanche.
{90036}{90111}How do they call you, señorita?
{90168}{90238}- Elena.|- Elena, huh?
{90243}{90325}Elena. Well, that'll do for now.
{90329}{90367}Stone Calf know about this?
{90378}{90434}No. But he will find out.
{90438}{90486}And when he does,|he will follow, señor.
{90490}{90546}Of that you may be sure.
{90552}{90609}If you are wise,|you will send me back.
{90613}{90656}You mean, you want to go back?
{90679}{90740}It does not matter.
{90746}{90820}For five years, I have been|Stone Calf's woman.
{90824}{90882}His squaw.
{90922}{90978}I'm not worth fighting for.
{91008}{91092}All right, come on. Come on.|Let's get out of here.
{91102}{91152}Well, are you coming or aren't you?
{91162}{91241}Stone Calf will never let me go.|He will kill you both!
{91246}{91327}Yeah, I know. All right now, you can|stay here or you can come with us.
{91331}{91382}It makes no difference to us.|Come on.
{92015}{92061}All right, hold it.
{92110}{92178}Well, this looks like|as good a place as any.
{92182}{92236}We'll stop here.
{92278}{92347}Señorita, how about you rustling up|some firewood?
{92351}{92416}I could do with a pot of coffee.
{92712}{92763}You're not gonna build a fire.
{92794}{92858}Why don't you send up|smoke signals while you're at it?
{92862}{92911}I can't spell.
{92970}{93031}Let me set you straight.
{93041}{93092}While there's daylight, we travel.
{93096}{93155}- All right, you go ahead.|- What are you gonna do?
{93159}{93214}Sit here and wait for him|to catch up with you?
{93218}{93252}Yeah, something like that.
{93256}{93298}Unless you've got some better ideas.
{93302}{93364}What, with all that|West Point training of yours...
{93368}{93416}...maybe you think|we ought to surround him.
{93420}{93470}Oh, come on, use your head.
{93474}{93576}Killing Stone Calf or him killing us|could set off another Comanche war.
{93581}{93675}All right, if I get killed I kind of hope|maybe they will set off another war.
{93679}{93736}I'm not gonna argue, McCabe.|I'm giving an order!
{93740}{93803}Well, I've taken just about|all the orders I can stand.
{93807}{93866}- You don't bluff me with that!|- Now, wait a minute.
{93870}{93920}Just a minute, Jim.
{93956}{93988}Just a minute.
{94008}{94059}Now, you think back.
{94077}{94124}Now, I haven't drawn on|very many men...
{94128}{94235}...but when I did I wasn't bluffing,|and I'm not bluffing now.
{94290}{94356}Now, don't you make me prove it.
{94400}{94495}I'm giving you fair warning, McCabe.
{94501}{94574}I'll jump you the first chance I get.
{94594}{94681}You're just bull-headed enough|to do it, aren't you?
{94708}{94740}Aren't you?
{94862}{94957}All right, Jim, you want to go on ahead,|I want to stay here. We'll split up.
{94961}{95019}- You take young Wringle with you.|- What about her?
{95023}{95088}Hey, señorita, come here.
{95092}{95144}Now, he's going on ahead,|I'm gonna stay here.
{95148}{95180}What do you wanna do?
{95184}{95254}- I stay with you.|- There you are.
{95357}{95417}Now, remember, McCabe...
{95421}{95480}...don't expect any help.
{95484}{95537}When I leave here, I'm gone.
{95546}{95633}- And I won't be back.|- Good riddance. Come on.
{95637}{95685}Keep an eye on junior, Jim!
{95690}{95767}You know he's worth|1000 bucks to me!
{95827}{95902}Go on. Go on.|Get the fire ready. Go on.
{96288}{96327}William.
{96331}{96363}That's him.
{96399}{96451}Good morning, sir.
{96522}{96571}I believe this is what you wanted.
{96873}{96913}Posey.
{96921}{96961}Yes, sir.
{97341}{97406}Toby! Toby!
{97996}{98060}All right, now that's enough.|Keep going.
{98071}{98166}All right, file by and take a look|if you want to, but keep going.
{98409}{98490}One boy's not gonna satisfy|those people. What can I tell them?
{98494}{98560}How can I convince them|there's no hope for the others?
{98564}{98625}- It happens to be the truth, sir.|- It's not the truth.
{98631}{98672}Not when you admit|talking to Mrs...
{98677}{98763}What's her name? The wife of that|bible-thumper, Mrs. Clegg.
{98767}{98849}- You disobeyed orders, Mr. Gary.|- Yes, sir.
{98853}{98928}And you stood by while McCabe|traded weapons with Quanah Parker.
{98932}{98964}Yes, sir.
{98968}{99028}Now you're willing to condone|a further deception...
{99032}{99092}...by passing off Running Wolf|as the Wringle boy...
{99096}{99148}...when there's not|a particle of proof he is.
{99152}{99234}- He fits the description.|- Well, he fits a half-dozen descriptions.
{99238}{99276}No, sir.
{99280}{99323}Not going to be a party to any fraud.
{99327}{99386}Let McCabe whistle|for his blood money.
{99390}{99442}For all we know,|he'll never come back anyway.
{99446}{99496}Sir, I promised.
{99500}{99588}He earned the money, even if|he never gets a chance to spend it.
{99592}{99664}I see no reason to honour|a promise to a dead man...
{99668}{99751}...when it entails|a cruel lie to the living.
{99772}{99813}I'll handle this in my way, mister.
{99817}{99860}Yes, sir.
{99882}{99956}Jim, I know you did|what you thought best.
{99960}{100042}By trying to spare people pain|you can sometimes cause more.
{100046}{100140}This was a job for a hard man.|That's why I picked McCabe.
{100150}{100254}I thought he might be able to teach you|something I've never been able to.
{100258}{100301}Well, what's that, sir?
{100305}{100384}That only God|has the right to play God.
{100893}{100989}- What? Why, you dirty, rotten gut...|- Come on. Come on now, that's enough.
{100993}{101049}- Comanche... Get off of me!|- Move him out.
{101053}{101104}- Come on.|- What kind of an army you got here?
{101108}{101167}I'm a decent taxpayer,|and no dirty, rotten...
{101239}{101350}He was an officer|in the American Army.
{101387}{101446}Lieutenant Thompson.
{101471}{101574}We met at this {y:i}baile, this dance...
{101594}{101632}Veracruz?
{101636}{101773}My father had been transferred there|from the presidio at San Fernando.
{101811}{101844}We...
{101849}{101892}We danced.
{101905}{101938}We laughed.
{101942}{102050}- And you fell in love.|- {y:i}Sí, we became engaged.
{102078}{102240}And so, on my 17th birthday,|we began the journey.
{102260}{102361}My father, an escort of dragoons|from his regiment...
{102368}{102427}...my {y:i}due{y:i}ña.
{102477}{102512}Well, do you have no mother?
{102525}{102571}No.
{102575}{102654}She died when I was very young.
{102708}{102771}Two days after we had crossed|the Rio Bravo...
{102830}{102919}...the Comanches...
{103132}{103184}Did you hear something?
{103242}{103288}No. No.
{103321}{103365}No, I didn't hear anything.
{103489}{103559}Say, why don't you come over here|and sit down?
{103564}{103608}Over here.
{103651}{103701}Sit over here.
{103794}{103854}No, no. Look, over here.
{103978}{104032}There, that's better.
{104054}{104151}It's a little more companionable|like that.
{104170}{104239}Being a dark night and all that.
{104341}{104422}You don't mind if I put my arm|around you, do you?
{104546}{104593}Now...
{104602}{104660}Now, go on with your story now.
{104697}{104755}What were you saying?
{104763}{104807}The Comanches attacked?
{105436}{105480}Shut up!
{106115}{106164}Go on, the horses.
{106557}{106619}Now, I want to...
{106626}{106678}I assume that you've|all had an opportunity...
{106682}{106766}...to look at this captive boy|Lieutenant Gary brought in.
{106779}{106871}And I want to say to all of you|that we haven't the slightest inkling...
{106876}{106920}...as to this boy's identity.
{106924}{106979}That's my boy. That's my Toby.
{106983}{107077}Or where, or how,|or even when he was captured.
{107095}{107136}Certainly must've been very young.
{107140}{107204}He neither speaks nor understands|a word of English.
{107213}{107295}Major, may I have a word, please?
{107299}{107343}Do you think it possible...
{107347}{107482}...that an older boy, say 7 or 8, could|forget his English so completely?
{107492}{107583}Well, I wouldn't say it was likely,|Mr. Purcell, but certainly possible.
{107587}{107639}Hearing nothing|but Comanche for 10 years.
{107643}{107691}Living like one.|Getting to think like one.
{107695}{107726}Yes, I've known cases.
{107730}{107787}- Please, Mr...|- Stand him up.
{107803}{107897}- Get up there, Injun!|- Watch it! Watch it!
{107995}{108079}Well, anyone here|want to claim him?
{108128}{108172}Oh, no. Not me.
{108176}{108255}You couldn't pay me|to take in a mad dog like that.
{108259}{108337}I say we've come|on a fool's errand, all of us.
{108341}{108462}Let the dead past bury its dead.|Let's go back home where we belong.
{108560}{108625}You sure you didn't see my Freda?
{108629}{108685}She was 9 year old.|Blue eyes, gold hair...
{108689}{108798}No. No, Mr. Knudsen,|I told you, I didn't see her.
{108918}{108980}I say we should go back home|where we belong.
{108984}{109043}I agree with Mr. Wringle.
{109049}{109115}I've thought so|for a long time, Marty.
{109119}{109190}If this unfortunate boy is an example|of what we can expect...
{109194}{109247}...then I say we're too late.
{109259}{109312}Major, give him his freedom.
{109330}{109397}Send him back|to the only life he knows.
{109408}{109450}Why, no.
{109454}{109528}Why, no, you can't send him back.|That's my boy.
{109532}{109605}Why, Marty,|you know that's my Toby.
{109610}{109685}William, tell them that's our Toby.
{109690}{109738}Oh, William, don't let them|send him away!
{109742}{109821}- Don't let them send him away!|- Relax now. They won't send him away.
{109825}{109886}- Toby!|- Mrs. McCandless, please.
{109890}{109930}- Marty, that's my Toby!|- Easy, lad.
{109940}{110025}I'll take the boy, sir,|since no one else wants him.
{110029}{110105}Do you really think he might be|your son, McCandless?
{110122}{110188}Between the two of us, no, sir.
{110192}{110282}But if you ask me again|I'll swear on the Bible he is.
{110301}{110418}Major, my Mary ain't ever gonna|know what's real and what ain't.
{110422}{110475}But if I can give her|comfort in a lie...
{110479}{110557}...l'm sure God won't kick me|out of heaven for it.
{110561}{110624}So with your consent, sir...
{110628}{110730}...l'll take our Toby|and do the best I can for him.
{110740}{110797}Well, you're taking on|a serious responsibility...
{110801}{110832}...and a dangerous one.
{110836}{110891}But he's yours.|Good luck to you.
{111487}{111533}Mrs. Frazer, ma'am!
{111537}{111624}Mrs. Frazer, on the double, please!
{111628}{111711}You, you're supposed to be dead.
{111715}{111793}I'm sorry, Slim. I didn't quite make it.
{112000}{112052}Come on. Come on.
{112144}{112176}Mrs. Frazer.
{112180}{112224}Marshal McCabe,|we thought you...
{112228}{112289}Yes, yes, I already heard about that.
{112293}{112358}I wonder, ma'am,|if you'd take care of her.
{112362}{112413}Her name's Elena.
{112432}{112467}Elena de la Madriaga.
{112471}{112513}You're very welcome, my dear.
{112517}{112562}Thank you, ma'am.
{112725}{112780}You are not going to leave?
{112805}{112859}No, I wouldn't...
{112875}{112935}No, I'm not gonna leave.
{113031}{113098}You go on there.
{113213}{113298}Come on, marshal,|this will be a pleasure.
{113477}{113525}Evening, ma'am.
{113529}{113568}Evening.
{113868}{113908}How are you?
{113966}{114003}Hi, Reverend.
{114007}{114065}Ortho. Greely.
{114169}{114216}What's the matter with them?
{114255}{114320}Well, I'll be damned.
{114329}{114371}Hi, Jim.
{114383}{114436}Should've stuck around.|Missed the excitement.
{114440}{114512}- Yeah, I must've.|- Yeah.
{114516}{114560}Hey. Hey, wait a minute. Wait.
{114564}{114640}Hold on. Now this kid's supposed|to belong to Henry J. Wringle.
{114644}{114727}- Oh, and just who says so?|- I do.
{114731}{114794}I wouldn't take him|if you'd pay me 1000 dollars.
{114798}{114860}Now, wait a minute, Henry.|You and me made a deal...
{114864}{114957}- I don't know what you're talking about.|- You don't know what I'm talking about?
{114961}{115014}Maybe the major|wants to know what...
{115018}{115110}The major would, McCabe,|but the matter's been settled.
{115114}{115178}The boy's been identified|and claimed by the McCandlesses.
{115182}{115279}- Well, I'll just straighten you up.|- This is my boy.
{115283}{115370}Oh, thank you. Thank you.
{115399}{115448}Wait a minute, what...?
{115452}{115533}Jim, I told you that Henry J. Wringle|was supposed to get that kid.
{115537}{115632}Yeah, well, you heard Henry J.|He wouldn't take him as a gift.
{115649}{115717}- The matter's been settled, McCabe.|- Oh, you keep out of it.
{115721}{115767}You can't address me|in those terms, sir.
{115771}{115818}What do you mean I can't?
{115822}{115922}Just because you got that Yankee|soldier suit on, don't... Don't try and...
{115926}{116026}- You got no authority over me!|- That's where you're mistaken.
{116031}{116069}You're still on the Army payroll.
{116073}{116141}At $80 a month, Guth, remember?
{116145}{116224}- All right, I quit, I resign. I quit.|- No, you don't. No, you don't.
{116228}{116275}- Sure. Why...?|- Mr. Gary...
{116279}{116345}...put him under house arrest,|till we can talk this over.
{116349}{116382}Yes, sir.
{116386}{116435}Hey, now, wait a...|Now, you listen to me...
{116439}{116505}No, you listen to me for a change.
{116509}{116594}Now, you coming along peaceably,|or do I have to get rough?
{116617}{116650}Jim!
{116654}{116757}You see, McCabe,|I don't bluff easy either.
{116761}{116809}Now, don't make me prove it.
{116825}{116876}- I've heard of the old Army...|- Sergeant.
{116880}{116929}- Yes, sir.|- Remove the body.
{116933}{117027}- Marshal, this time I'll buy the beer.|- Jim!
{117031}{117114}Jim, don't... You gonna let them|take me to jail?
{117176}{117221}Evening, Marty.
{117274}{117326}Looks like you're about ready.
{117334}{117388}When do you expect to pull out?
{117392}{117430}Sunup.
{117434}{117528}So much left to pack, I don't know|where we're gonna put it all.
{117549}{117588}Well...
{117592}{117666}I haven't seen one of these things|in years.
{117783}{117832}It was my brother's.
{117836}{117897}He wouldn't go to sleep without it.
{118024}{118129}In a way, I guess, it's become|the voice of my conscience.
{118139}{118198}He meant so much to my father.
{118202}{118255}Everything was Steve.
{118263}{118358}Talk of him going to college and|becoming a lawyer too.
{118379}{118466}I was jealous of him,|I know that now.
{118472}{118540}I used to pray to be|changed into a boy.
{118544}{118589}Times I still do.
{118600}{118687}Climb trees, throw rocks, go fishing.
{118691}{118760}Is that why you wear these clothes?
{118764}{118814}Won't go to dances?
{118842}{118884}Maybe.
{118888}{118980}There's a dance tonight at the post.
{118984}{119042}Bachelor officer's hop.
{119052}{119132}I'm a bachelor, you know?
{119174}{119243}Another thing|you ought to know is that...
{119248}{119293}How did you know?
{119325}{119364}Well, I...
{119411}{119443}I asked.
{119534}{119574}Come here.
{119622}{119715}Now, another thing you ought|to know about... Oh, excuse me.
{119719}{119806}Another thing you ought to know|about me is I like the Army.
{119810}{119890}I just wouldn't be happy|anywhere else.
{119904}{119986}Oh, I know the pay isn't much.
{120005}{120059}Won't buy diamond earrings...
{120063}{120146}...and fancy dresses, stuff like that.
{120162}{120238}And it can be a lonely life|for a woman.
{120260}{120327}But it can be a good life too.
{120388}{120443}Are you proposing to me,|Lieutenant Gary?
{120447}{120534}No! No, I was just asking you to go|to the dance with me tonight.
{120538}{120616}And as far as proposing,|I was gonna get around to that later.
{120620}{120667}I'll call for you at 8, Marty.
{120671}{120720}I haven't said I accept!
{120724}{120810}I didn't promise you a thing,|Jim Gary!
{121125}{121164}Come in.
{121171}{121220}The prisoner,|present and accounted for.
{121224}{121275}Good evening.|Care for a glass of sherry?
{121279}{121338}- No, sir, I might take...|- That'll be all, sergeant.
{121342}{121380}Yes, sir.
{121490}{121569}No, I would not care|for a glass of sherry.
{121573}{121683}I would care for a glass of whiskey,|a tall glass of whiskey.
{121749}{121790}I've never liked you, Mr. McCabe.
{121794}{121847}Well, now you surprise me.
{121870}{121911}However, I will concede...
{121915}{122005}...that you have done me|and the Army a great service.
{122012}{122079}We can come to terms|with Quanah Parker...
{122083}{122166}...but there was no reasoning|with hotheads like Stone Calf.
{122170}{122231}His death was most timely.
{122241}{122328}Well, to your prompt return|to Tascosa.
{122332}{122397}What's that mean?|I'm not under arrest?
{122432}{122510}Here are your discharge papers,|Mr. McCabe.
{122514}{122591}With some reluctance, I have|granted you an honourable discharge...
{122595}{122629}...and $40 for your services.
{122633}{122702}- Well, you said it was $80 a month.|- Two weeks makes 40.
{122706}{122765}I shelled out more than that|for the trade goods.
{122769}{122809}Yes, and for rifles.
{122813}{122901}Too bad. Looks like you made|a bad investment.
{122976}{123052}Well, here.
{123115}{123198}- What was that for, sir?|- That's for the drink.
{123286}{123362}Oh, you don't even store|honest whiskey.
{123431}{123463}Guthrie.
{123467}{123502}- She wants to speak...|- Guthrie?
{123506}{123576}- Will you go in, please?|- Yeah, that's my name.
{123618}{123674}Why does she want to speak to him?
{123678}{123736}Oh, of all the stupid,|tactless people I've ever...
{123740}{123811}- Well, I still want to know...|- Oh, shut up!
{123852}{123884}Guthrie?
{124002}{124047}What is it now?
{124104}{124136}These people.
{124140}{124256}They smile at me and show their teeth,|but it's the eyes that bite.
{124267}{124362}I have not seen the back|of anyone's head since I came here.
{124366}{124499}Their eyes are all on my body|like dirty fingers.
{124503}{124583}As if they would turn their backs,|I would leap upon them...
{124587}{124674}...and my touch would have|to be washed off like filth.
{124695}{124749}You should not have brought me here.
{124759}{124801}I do not belong with these people.
{124805}{124892}Running Wolf was brought in here|tied to a hand-led horse.
{124896}{124931}You weren't, you know.
{124935}{125007}But how could I know|I would come back to this?
{125022}{125128}For five years with the Comanches,|my eyes never saw a tear.
{125132}{125249}Now they see the silent questions.
{125264}{125333}How many braves has she known?
{125337}{125411}How many mestizo children|carry her blood in their veins?
{125415}{125514}Now, why didn't I kill myself?|I took a Comanche!
{125548}{125611}Well, that's great. That's...
{125616}{125710}That's great. You wanna go back, spend|the rest of your life as a Comanche?
{125714}{125777}Hide behind that old war paint,|dead before you're 30.
{125781}{125808}I don't understand it.
{125812}{125887}With all the Comanche|that's rubbed off on you, I don't know...
{125891}{125939}Why didn't you soak up|a little backbone...
{125943}{125984}...so you could stand up and fight?
{125988}{126024}- Why didn't you do that?|- Fight?
{126028}{126101}- Now, listen, you listen to me.|- How can I fight?
{126110}{126188}Now, nobody wants their past|tattooed across their forehead.
{126192}{126258}But you're gonna take those years|to the grave with you.
{126262}{126315}Sooner you learn to live|with them, the better.
{126319}{126374}Now, can't you understand that?
{126382}{126509}You... You know, I prayed and prayed|that someone would come and help me.
{126513}{126546}And you. You...
{126550}{126621}- Oh, now cut that out.|- I don't know how to show my gratitude.
{126625}{126717}You hush. You hush.|Now, well... Stand up. Stand up.
{126731}{126784}That darn thing. I...
{126788}{126900}Now, just don't interrupt me.|I'm... I'm thinking.
{126948}{127027}Now, these people|are giving a dance tonight.
{127031}{127063}Dance?
{127067}{127158}And you and me are gonna attend|that hoedown.
{127162}{127196}We're gonna, but...
{127200}{127248}You're gonna have|to get yourself fixed up.
{127252}{127325}You gotta get a comb.|And you have to have a dress.
{127329}{127377}Now, where am I gonna get a dress?
{127381}{127424}Jim Gary.
{127428}{127513}Jim Gary. He's engaged|to that little girl down at the settlers'.
{127517}{127577}He doesn't know it yet,|but he's engaged.
{127581}{127638}She might have a dress.|She's about the same size.
{127642}{127681}You turn around.|Well, never mind.
{127685}{127725}Never mind. She might have a dress.
{127729}{127786}And you've got to do something|about these.
{127790}{127933}Either put them back,|or put them up like...
{127996}{128079}Well, now, you get yourself fixed up,|I'll get the dress.
{129383}{129446}So you are leaving...
{129450}{129524}When did you say you were leaving?
{129550}{129592}Sunup.
{129667}{129770}Independence,|that's a mighty long way.
{129777}{129827}Yes, it is.
{129850}{129886}I...
{129890}{130001}I've been thinking, I get a furlough|in about three months...
{130023}{130108}...do you think maybe I could come|and visit you?
{130205}{130312}Lieutenant Gary,|are you proposing now?
{130354}{130401}Yeah, I...
{130409}{130456}I guess I am.
{130473}{130559}Well, aren't you...?
{130598}{130639}Don't you...?
{130880}{130917}Yeah.
{131332}{131385}Mama's gonna untie you.
{131389}{131458}I'm not going to leave you|tied up like that.
{131845}{131887}Braid.
{131891}{132025}Mama's gonna cut that off|so you'll be my darling little white boy.
{132118}{132171}Toby!
{132437}{132507}- Good evening.|- Evening, sir.
{132630}{132683}Come on, señorita.
{132689}{132751}Let's go in and knock them dead.
{132935}{132972}- Well, good evening.|- Hello, Jim.
{132976}{133021}Looking fit.
{133030}{133102}Come on over here|and say hello to the major.
{133167}{133229}Major, you know|Señorita de la Madriaga.
{133233}{133266}- Major Frazer.|- Glad you could come.
{133270}{133360}- And Mrs. Frazer.|- Very beautiful. Won't you sit down?
{133364}{133425}And you know Miss Purcell,|daughter of Judge Purcell.
{133429}{133507}- Of course. How are you, my dear?|- You know Marshal McCabe.
{133511}{133595}Crusader of the law, diplomat,|adventurer, man-about...
{133599}{133684}Yes, thank you. Thank you.|Major, you have a very fine jail here.
{133688}{133738}I thought you'd appreciate it.
{133742}{133794}Well, you dance?
{133798}{133878}No, but I take an occasional drink.
{133882}{133937}Bar's right in there.
{134435}{134515}Can we get you ladies|some refreshments?
{134552}{134593}Marty?
{134629}{134663}Punch?
{134667}{134728}Oh, yes.
{134753}{134846}- Well, excuse us.|- Yeah, we'll bring it right back.
{134985}{135038}- Four, Posey.|- No, three.
{135042}{135104}- Enjoying the dance, marshal?|- No.
{135228}{135312}Well, looks like|we poisoned the waterhole.
{135316}{135358}Yeah.
{135529}{135623}Say, Upton, have you got a free dance|for Miss de la Madriaga?
{135627}{135699}Sorry, Gary,|my program's all filled up.
{135855}{135930}Chase, how about you?|You got a free dance for the señorita?
{135934}{135969}Well, sir, excuse me, but...
{135973}{136022}But this is our dance,|don't you remember?
{136026}{136112}Oh, wonderful. Excuse me, sir.
{136767}{136807}- Will you have some?|- No, thank you.
{136811}{136856}- Hey, that's a good idea.|- I thought so.
{136860}{136904}- Will you...?|- No, thanks.
{136908}{136972}- Major?|- No, thank you.
{136978}{137026}Would you care to dance, Marty?
{137030}{137071}Come on.
{137075}{137112}Come on.
{137396}{137499}Some of the ladies were inquiring...|Well, what they really wanna know is...
{137503}{137598}...in this marriage to the Indian,|were there no children?
{137611}{137643}No, madam.
{137647}{137694}Oh, I see.
{137983}{138087}My dear, we were wondering,|among the savages, is it true...?
{138091}{138123}Elena!
{138374}{138424}Now, you listen here.
{138428}{138527}Now, you and me didn't get all|dressed up tonight for nothing.
{138566}{138613}Now, come on.
{138790}{138846}You did that on purpose, Gary.|Don't you deny it.
{138850}{138934}If you want satisfaction, Mr. Upton,|I'm at your disposal.
{138938}{138992}The same goes for you, Mr. Chase!
{138996}{139039}And that goes for all you gentlemen!
{139044}{139102}- Gary!|- Oh, please.
{139142}{139175}I saw that, Mr. Gary.
{139179}{139240}You'll apologise to Mr. Upton|and this entire company.
{139244}{139305}I will not apologise, sir, respectfully.
{139309}{139369}Major, please.
{139382}{139513}If there is any apology|to this assembly it is mine.
{139517}{139593}This is a military matter, Miss Madriaga,|nothing to do with you.
{139597}{139698}If I were not here tonight, major,|this would not have happened.
{139702}{139758}Am I allowed to speak?
{139762}{139841}Why, certainly. Yes.
{139938}{140003}Ladies and gentlemen...
{140021}{140132}...it seems like the only embarrassment|here tonight is my presence.
{140143}{140212}If the truth will quiet|your unspoken questions...
{140216}{140250}...I give it gladly.
{140268}{140368}For five years I was the woman|of the Comanche, Stone Calf.
{140398}{140447}He treated me like a wife.
{140460}{140556}The work was hard,|the scoldings frequent...
{140572}{140644}...and occasionally he beat me.
{140674}{140746}I did not bear him any children.
{140771}{140860}I know that many of you regard me|as a degraded woman.
{140882}{140948}Degraded by the touch|of a savage Comanche...
{140952}{141020}...by having had to live|as one of them.
{141024}{141135}You said l... Why did I not kill myself?
{141139}{141177}Why I did not...?
{141186}{141245}- Why, I...?|- Go on. Go on, you're doing fine.
{141249}{141343}- I can't!|- Well, I sure as hell can.
{141354}{141455}She didn't kill herself|because her religion forbids it.
{141485}{141573}You know, sometimes it takes more|courage to live than it does to die.
{141577}{141637}You'd agree with that,|wouldn't you, major?
{141641}{141705}You know, I don't think|any of you folks in this room...
{141709}{141753}...have ever been|to a Comanche camp.
{141757}{141806}Have you, major?
{141819}{141858}- Well...|- No. No.
{141862}{141955}I have. I usually limit my visits|to three days.
{141959}{142021}Three days.|That's about 45 working hours...
{142025}{142068}...for a woman in one of those camps.
{142072}{142152}You know, a Comanche, he don't know|when Sunday comes.
{142156}{142257}And cooking's sort of the recreation|for the women, they...
{142261}{142347}And then, in their spare time, they|chew the glue out of buffalo hides...
{142351}{142419}...so that their man can have|a nice soft pair of moccasins.
{142423}{142483}You can judge for yourself|what kind of life it is...
{142487}{142539}...by the number of survivors|we brought back.
{142543}{142622}- That's right, McCabe only...|- Yeah, but you shut up. You shut up.
{142641}{142686}And now some of you are asking...
{142690}{142735}...why this young lady|doesn't go back.
{142739}{142798}Well, it might be interesting|for you to know...
{142802}{142890}...that this afternoon|she asked me to take her back.
{142918}{142981}Because she was treated much better|by the Comanches...
{142985}{143055}...than she's been treated|by some of you.
{143124}{143170}Good going.
{143211}{143262}Permission to leave, sir.
{143266}{143356}Mrs. Frazer, it was a grand party.
{143943}{143977}Hold everything here!
{143981}{144024}Hold it! Hold it! What is this?
{144028}{144074}Cold-blooded murder,|that's what it is.
{144078}{144129}And in my opinion,|you're as much to blame...
{144133}{144191}...as that mad dog you brought in.
{144206}{144257}Come on!
{144272}{144386}No, Mr. Wringle, don't blame him.|It was my fault, all of it.
{144390}{144423}God pity me.
{144427}{144497}- Oh, no, not Mrs. McCandless?|- Yes, Martha.
{144501}{144560}She cut him loose|so he could eat his food.
{144564}{144643}He grabbed the knife|and stabbed her through the heart.
{144660}{144756}Now, look!|Look, I know how you men feel...
{144761}{144812}...but there's not going to be|any lynching.
{144816}{144856}You think you're going to stop it?
{144860}{144892}- Quiet! Quiet!|- Yes, I am.
{144896}{144929}Ortho. Greely.
{144933}{145027}Now, this here no lynching be,|soldier boy.
{145031}{145129}The boy's had a fair trial|with a judge and a jury.
{145133}{145186}I can imagine the kind|of a defence he had.
{145190}{145261}Lieutenant Gary!|I defended him as best I could.
{145265}{145346}- Yes, he did.|- But the jury decided different.
{145350}{145451}And I, as presiding judge,|pronounced the sentence.
{145455}{145539}He's to be hanged by the neck|until he's dead.
{145543}{145587}Now, wait a minute!
{145680}{145748}All right, bring him out to the tree.
{145998}{146065}Hey! Hey!
{146083}{146147}Mine! Mine! Mine!
{146151}{146217}Mine! Mine!
{146221}{146260}Mine!
{146264}{146335}Mine! Mine!
{146339}{146402}All right, get him up here|on the wagon.
{146433}{146509}No! No! No!
{146513}{146564}No!
{147218}{147274}McCandless!
{148583}{148618}Good morning, señor.
{149178}{149219}Hi there, Mr. McCabe!
{149226}{149284}Welcome home.
{149442}{149511}Ward, you're sitting in my chair.
{149536}{149575}You...
{149600}{149663}Those clothes look familiar to you?
{149668}{149722}- Yep.|- You got my clothes on?
{149735}{149779}No, sir, Mr. McCabe.
{149783}{149840}These ain't your clothes.
{149844}{149942}Belle, my fiancée,|Mrs. Aragon, that is...
{149951}{150046}...she sent off to San Antone for them.|Same place that you get yours.
{150061}{150147}I ain't wearing a single thing|belongs to you.
{150154}{150200}Excepting this star.
{150218}{150273}And that ain't yours no more.
{150277}{150329}Not since we had the election|last week.
{150345}{150409}I bet you can't guess|who's the new marshal.
{150413}{150452}Oh, don't tell me. Don't tell me.
{150456}{150503}Don't tell... Let me think this out.
{150507}{150570}Let me think. And you hush, Jim.|You hush.
{150574}{150663}- No, I have... Nothing.|- Not a word. Not a word.
{150700}{150786}I didn't get to vote for myself,|not even once.
{150809}{150880}Say, you fellas|sure look hot and thirsty.
{150884}{150971}How'd you like to have|a nice cold beer?
{150975}{151027}Honeybee.
{151083}{151130}Honeybee?
{151134}{151206}Sounded like "honeybee."
{151216}{151260}Honeybee.
{151344}{151385}Thank you.
{151540}{151592}Ma'am, I wouldn't go...
{151947}{151988}- You said the room was...|- The room.
{151992}{152057}- But not here. We'll...|- What's your rush?
{152061}{152133}- You haven't introduced the lady to me.|- And I don't intend to.
{152137}{152169}Really?
{152173}{152216}Then I'll introduce myself.
{152230}{152275}Belle Aragon.
{152279}{152355}And everything you see around here|belongs to me.
{152360}{152402}Including the livestock.
{152506}{152562}You are to be congratulated, madam.
{152575}{152633}"Miss," if you don't mind.
{152637}{152680}And you can drop the phoney airs.
{152698}{152796}I know all about you, Mrs. Stone Calf.
{152801}{152875}News travels fast in this country.
{152889}{152927}How'd you like a job, honey?
{152955}{153012}I could put your hair|in Indian braids.
{153016}{153120}A short skirt, some squaw boots,|a little bear grease.
{153124}{153162}You'd be quite an attraction.
{153341}{153425}- Does that stagecoach go to California?|- Yeah. Yes, ma'am.
{153429}{153522}That coach goes to El Paso.|You can change coaches there.
{153526}{153573}But you ain't going to California.
{153577}{153628}Yes, I am.
{153635}{153719}Thank you very much|for being so kind.
{153912}{153966}Belle, I'm gonna beat hell|out of you!
{153970}{154002}Honeybee!
{154083}{154167}- You thought I was fooling.|- No, no.
{154253}{154307}Please, do you have room for me?
{154311}{154399}Proud to haul you, ma'am,|proud to haul you. Step right in.
{154425}{154472}Ward.
{154478}{154515}Thanks for the beer. Jim.
{154519}{154589}And six months room rent.|And meals.
{154596}{154705}And six months room rent.|And meals.
{154709}{154758}And...
{154806}{154844}Jim.
{154875}{154925}Jim, take care of the Army.|They need you.
{154929}{154998}- So long. Good luck.|- So long.
{155002}{155056}So long, Belle!
{155088}{155136}- Hey, Slim.|- Yes, marshal?
{155140}{155193}- Come here a minute.|- Stand by, Chuck!
{155197}{155269}Come on! Come on, fellas!|We're late.
{155696}{155736}Hang on, señorita.
{155740}{155798}Here we go!
{155864}{155935}So long, Jim!
{156005}{156061}So long, Guth!
{156173}{156283}You'd think a woman|with my experience...
{156308}{156366}...would know more about men.
{156370}{156414}Yeah.
{156440}{156496}Well, guess old Guth|finally found something...
{156500}{156546}...he wanted more than 10 percent of.

Hilario.
Papa!
Sotero! My good friend.
How are ya?
You have a drink?
I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to see a village like this.
Santos!
So much restlessness and change in the outside world.
People no longer content with their station in life.
Women's fashions? Shameless.
Cigar.
Mire! Religion!
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is now a thing of the past.
Last month we were in San Juan... a rich town. Sit down.
Rich town, much blessed by God.
Big church.
Not like here... little church, priest comes twice a year. Big one!
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor box filled to overflowing?
You know what we found?
Brass candlesticks, almost nothing in the poor box.
But we took it anyway.
I know we took it anyway.
I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have.
That I could see for myself.
Don't see!
What if you had to carry my load?
The need to provide food, like a father, to fill the mouths of his hungry men.
Guns. Ammunition.
You know how much money that costs?!
No.
The days of good hunting are over.
Once there was horses, cattle, gold, fruit from the trees. No more.
Now I must hunt with a price on my head, rurales at my heels.
I'll be back.
Enough!
We'll get the rest when we come back.
I love this village.
I know you have your problems...
Murderer! Thief!
Rafael!
Rafael!
Rafael...
Rafael!
Stupid!
Stupid!
We have to have another discussion very soon.
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of my good friend Sotero.
Maybe when I come back, hm?
¡Adios!
Let's go!
Help me bring him in.
If he steals our harvest again... we might as well cut our throats and be done with it!
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.
Live somewhere else?
Take our homes with us? Our farms?
We... could hide some food.
From Calvera? He never steals all our food.
He leaves us enough to go on with.
That's something.
We could beg him to leave us more.
No, no. That would make him more angry.
I don't think we should do anything.
We must do something!
Like Rafael? Talk sense.
We break our backs in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.
We must do something!
We must do something.
But what?
I don't know.
We'll ask the old man.
He'll know.
Fight.
You must fight. Fight!
With machetes and bare hands against guns?!
Buy guns.
Buy?
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.
But what are we going to use for money?
Sell that.
And anything else you can collect.
Even if we had the guns... we know how to plant and grow
We don't know how to kill.
Then learn.
Or die.
Hey! I've been waitin' for you.
Oh, you did a wonderful job.
I'm sorry, but there'll be no funeral.
What?!
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as ready as the embalmer can make him... but there'll be no funeral.
Didn't I pay you enough?
It's not a question of money. For $20, I'd plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.
But the funeral's off.
Well, how d'ya like that?!
I want him buried. You want him buried.
If he could talk, he'd second the motion.
That's as unanimous as you can get.
You've behaved like a Christian, but...
Now, look. I'm not lookin' for any praise.
I'm a traveling salesman... ladies' corsets.
I'm walking down the street and a man drops dead.
For two hours people stepped over him, without lifting a finger.
I'm doing what any decent man would.
Come on, Henry...
No! This man has to be buried.
Soon. He's not turning into a nosegay.
I know. I would if I could, but... there's an element in town that objects.
Objects? To what?
They say he isn't fit to be buried there.
What? In Boot Hill?
There's nothing there but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.
And if they ever felt exclusive, they're past it now.
They happen to be white, friend.
And old Sam...
Well, old Sam was an Indian.
Well, I'll be damned!
I never knew you had to be anything but a corpse to get into Boot Hill.
How long's this been going on?
Since the town got civilized.
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it. No, sir.
I've always treated every man as another future customer.
In that case, get that hearse rollin'.
My driver's quit.
He's prejudiced too?
If it comes to gettin' his head blown off.
Well, get somebody else.
Nobody else will drive it!
So here.
Oh, hell! If that's all that's holding things up, I'll drive the rig.
Can I borrow that scatter-gun?
You're more than welcome.
Hey! Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.
It's the only one in the county.
I'll be darned if
I let it be shot at.
I'll pay for the damages.
I wanna see this.
Me, too!
Never rode shotgun on a hearse before.
Let her buck.
New in town?
Yeah.
Where are you from?
Dodge. You?
Tombstone. See any action up there?
Tombstone?
Same. People all settled down, like.
Same all over.
Injun lovers!
Easy. Just wind.
We'll get there.
It's not gettin' up there that bothers me.
It's stayin' up there that I mind.
Comin' up behind us on the left.
I don't think so.
Second-storey window.
Curtain moved.
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.
You elected?
No.
I got nominated real good.
Boys, why don't you just turn around now... save yourselves a lot of trouble?
Soon?
The reception committee is forming.
Hold it.
Hold it right there.
Anything wrong?
Turn that rig around and get it down the hill.
I need six men up here.
Yahoo!
Boys, the drinks are on me!
Hey! Hey!
I'd like to buy you a drink.
And your friend, too.
Thanks.
Where are you from?
Oh, yeah. Where are you goin'?
Thanks for the free show.
You're more than welcome.
Boy, that was really something. I won't forget that if I live to be a hundred.
Henry, the stage is leavin'!
All right, all right!
Wait till Flora hears about this. Y'know, she won't believe one word of it.
Henry! The stage! Come on!
You keep this.
Where are you headed?
I'm drifting south, more or less.
You?
Just driftin'.
Any action here?
Yeah. Grocery clerk and bouncer in one of those bars across the street, if that's your taste.
Yeah.
Well... see ya.
Say... what's your name?
Make it Vin.
What's yours?
Chris.
Yes?
We think you are a man we can trust.
Thank you very much.
We wish you to help us.
There's this man, Calvera.
A thief. A murderer.
He and his men, they steal our food, and then they leave us to starve.
Not only that, but our women...
Wait, wait. Just a minute.
If you need protection, go to the rurales.
We did. Twice.
But they can't station men in a small village for... who knows how long?
So they left.
And when they left, he came again...
Calvera...and every year since.
He will do so until he is stopped.
Sit down.
We need help.
We must buy guns.
We know nothing about them.
Will you buy guns for us?
Guns are very expensive and hard to get.
Why don't you hire men?
Men?
Gunmen. Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.
Will you go?
It will be a blessing if you help us.
Sorry, I'm not in the blessing business.
No, no. We offer more than that.
We could feed you every day.
And we have this.
What's that?
We can sell this for gold.
Everything we own.
Everything of value in the village.
I've been offered a lot for my work, but never everything.
Will it be enough?
You see, if we could drive the bandits away... life could be very good in our village.
But as it is, we ourselves could stand it a little longer... but the children, they cry because they're hungry.
Do you understand what it means when you start something like this?
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.
When Calvera comes, the church bell will ring the alarm.
We'll fight with guns, if we have them.
If we don't, with machetes, axes, clubs, anything!
Once you begin... you have to be prepared for killing and more killing.
And still more killing...until the reason for it has gone.
We understand.
We've considered that.
Does every man in the village feel the same?
Every man.
I'll see what I can do for you.
Gracias. You know...
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.
I'll pass the word around that you're looking for men.
It won't be hard to find men here.
Everyone wears a gun.
Sure... same as they wear pants.
That's expected.
But good men? That's something else again.
How can you tell they are good?
There are ways.
Come in.
The word is out you're looking for men.
That's right. Men who are good with that.
I'm good with it.
Fast?
Try me.
I aim to. Step in closer.
Now, hold your hands like that.
Now, clap.
Faster.
Now, as fast as you can.
Now you try it.
Very young and... and very proud.
The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud.
Come in.
No tricks now, Chris.
Harry! It's good to see you again.
Chris.
What are you doing in this dump?
I heard you've got a contract open.
Not for a high-stepper like you.
A dollar bill always looks as big to me as a bedspread.
It's just eating money.
A gold eagle, room and board. Six weeks gunning for some farmers.
You old Cajun! You don't talk so good, but you always know what's goin' on.
Oh, Harry.
With your permission.
All right. All that's on top.
What's underneath?
Only what I told you.
Gold? Cattle? Payroll?
Only what I told you.
Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.
Harry, please don't understand me so fast!
I said never mind. I'm in.
You dirty dog!
Place your bets.
Five.
Five.
Eight.
Eights again. Ten at the point.
The cowpoke that just walked in in the stovepipe chaps...
I'd like to buy him a drink.
Yes, sir!
Válgame Dios. There's one.
Look at the scars on his face.
The man for us is the one who gave him that face.
Hey... you learn fast.
Next bet comin' up.
Crap.
Next man.
Gent over there wants to buy you a drink.
Vin.
Howdy.
I'd like to buy you a drink.
Whiskey.
Have you anything lined up?
Yeah. I'm gonna take a job in a grocery store.
Fella says I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.
Crackerjack.
If that's your taste...
I heard of a job shooin' some flies away from a village, but I don't know the pay.
A week?
Six weeks: the whole job.
Well, that's ridiculous.
You heard of anything?
Yeah.
Shooing some flies away from a little village.
Their village.
It pays $20?
I'm looking for men right now.
No, it wouldn't even pay for my bullets.
Ours is a poor village.
We understand. You could get much more in a grocery store... and it's good, steady work.
Yep.
How many you got?
Looking for O'Reilly.
Don't know his name, but there's a fella in back choppin' wood for his breakfast.
Mornin'.
I'm a friend of Harry Luck's.
He tells me you're broke.
Nah, I'm doing this because
I'm an eccentric millionaire
There's a job for six men, watching over a village, south of the border.
How big's the opposition?
Thirty guns.
I admire your notion of fair odds, mister.
Harry tells me you faced bigger odds in the Travis County war.
Well, they paid me
$600 for that one.
He said you got that
Salinas thing cleared up.
They paid me $800 for that one.
You cost a lot.
Yeah...
That's right, I cost a lot.
The offer is $20.
Right now, that's a lot.
Where can I reach you?
Right here.
I still say he can't.
And I tell you he can.
If he claims that, he's a liar.
Not so loud. He might hear you.
I don't give a damn if he hears me or not.
I got two months' salary comin'.
I'll bet it all it ain't so.
Well, you ain't bettin' with me.
Me either.
I told you what he said, and I believe him.
Well, one of us is a fathead.
You can get good odds on which.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Britt. Britt, wake up.
I'm talkin' to ya! Look at me!
Filene told me what you said. I say you're wrong. What d'you say?
Ha! Ha! Ha!
What's the matter? You afraid?
Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?!
Call it.
Well, you see, I won.
Well, how about it?
Well?
Filene, how about it?
I don't know.
It was mighty close.
Close? What d'you mean, close? You all got eyes.
You saw what happened. I won!
You tell 'em. I won, didn't I?
You lost.
You're a liar.
I said you're a liar!
I said you're a coward and a liar!
Get up. Let's do it for real.
Get up!
Get up, I said!
So help me, I'll let you have it right where you are.
Call it!
I want nothin' to do with this.
Call it!
Drop it, Wallace. Forget it.
Get away from me.
Call it.
Britt.
Chris.
Can I have a word with you?
Did you have any luck?
Found a man who would have been perfect.
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.
Wasn't interested.
The money? It wasn't enough?
He doesn't care a hoot about money.
A man in this line of work who doesn't care about money?!
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.
Others, for reasons of their own, enjoy only the danger.
And the competition.
If he's the best with a knife and a gun, with whom does he compete?
Himself.
You.
I've been looking for you!
What have we got here?
Never mind.
He knows.
Clap hands, he says.
Clap your hands, and let's see how fast you are.
Clap hands!
A man comes to him... cos he respects him... cos he'd be proud to work with him.
He makes me look like two cents with some damned kids' game!
Hey, kid, that's enough of that!
You stay away from me, will ya?
Come on, now... and let's see how fast you are.
And no games? No clapping hands...none of that stuff!
Just draw.
Come on. Come on, draw!
Campesino. Come on!
You say campesino to me?!
You get out of my way, you dirt farmer!
You don't think I mean it?
You... think I'm just talking?
Hey... get up.
Do you hear me?
Get up and face me!
Do you hear?!
Hey... give him my gun.
Sorry this happened, friend.
Let him sleep it off.
When he wakes up, let him have his gun back.
And give him a drink.
I changed my mind.
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.
Remember me?
Yep.
You need men to do a job in Mexico.
That's right.
How long?
Four, six weeks.
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?
I thought you were looking for the Johnson brothers.
I found them.
How much does the job pay?
20. We leave tomorrow.
I'll have the money before I leave.
It'll just take care of my last two days' rent.
$20? You must be livin' in style.
Yes.
I have the most stylish corner of the filthy storeroom out back.
That, and one plate of beans:
$10 a day.
Yeah, things do get high when they find out you're on the run.
There's a dry wash south of town.
Pick me up there.
He's a good gun.
And we aren't heading for a church social.
Chris.
Yeah. He picked us up at dawn.
Any idea who it is?
Yeah. That kid from the saloon.
Won't take no for an answer.
Doesn't show much sense, does he?
I'm getting a stiff neck keepin' track of him.
If you can't forget him, why don't you ride side-saddle?
Well... he won't last much longer.
That so?
Ridin' out there in all that dust and heat...what a chucklehead!
Yeah. Not smart like us
Yep.
Suppose our friend over there has got anything to eat?
How about I bring him some?
It isn't food he's hungry for.
Then let me tie a can to his tail. Right now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.
Leave him alone.
It's a free country.
And it's his.
You know, it's funny. Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.
Where is everybody?
Where are they, Tomas?
Luis! Asunción! Demetrio!
Emilio! Sotero! What kind of a reception is this?
Come out! Come out and make them welcome, before we die of shame.
Hilario, stop your shouting.
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?!
Come in. You must be thirsty.
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.
They are afraid of everyone and everything.
They are afraid of rain, and no rain...
The summer may be too hot, the winter... too cold.
The sow has no pigs, the farmer is afraid he may starve.
She has too many, he's afraid she may starve.
There's no need to apologize. We didn't expect flowers and speeches.
Tomorrow is the anniversary of the founding of the village.
They will be celebrating...then, you will see them in a better light.
Who sounded the alarm?
Who sounded the alarm?!
I did.
Thank you, amigos, for coming out to greet us.
Thank you for letting us see your beautiful faces
Thank you, thank you, you chickens!
You come running out like chickens!
We ride to this middle of nowhere.
We're ready to risk our lives to help you.
And you?
You hide from us!
Hide... from us!
But it's a different story when you're in danger.
You might lose your precious crops.
Then you flock to us.
Well... we're here, my compadres and I.
And here we stay.
And you?
You prove to us that you're worth fighting for.
Now get back to your houses, back to work. Go on! Go back.
We'll let you know when to fight and how to fight.
Go back! All of you, go back!
Go back!
Now we're seven.
You know, I've been in some towns where the girls aren't very pretty.
As a matter of fact, I've been in some towns where they were downright ugly.
But this is the first time I've been in a town where there's no girls at all.
Except little ones.
If we're not careful, we can have quite a social life here
Oh, it's not so bad. I fell in with a fast crowd that hangs out near the fountain.
We got to predictin' the weather for today and didn't break up till twilight.
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!
Hilario!
Britt.
The boy saw three of Calvera's men.
The horses are in the arroyo.
Lee.
Get one alive.
Yes.
I'll show you where.
Rico, he knows where the arroyo is.
I'm sorry, Britt. I didn't mean to spoil it.
Shut up!
Oh... That... that was the greatest shot I've ever seen.
The worst.
I was aiming at the horse.
Three men were sent by Calvera to spy.
It's almost certain they saw us.
Whatever they learned will be buried with them.
¡Válgame Dios!
If he comes now...
He'd never send men ahead if he was near enough to see for himself.
So we have time to get ready. And we have something else... surprise.
If he rides in with no idea of the reception we can prepare for him...
I promise you, we'll all teach him something about the price of corn.
Aim... squeeze... cock.
Aim... squeeze... cock.
Settle down. Now, you miss the first chance, you may not get a second.
Get that butt tight in your shoulder.
If you don't, two things will happen.
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.
Now, close your eye. Aim from here, to here, to the target.
Fire.
That rock?
No, that man you're gonna kill.
Good!
If only we had more guns, think what we could do!
You'll get more guns.
How?
The same way you got these.
Calvera's men.
The ones who spied on us brought them.
Like three kings bearing gifts.
If Calvera does not come now, after all of this... what a waste!
A pretty foxy fellow, this Calvera, eh?
Señor, not a fox. A coyote!
How did he ever find out about the gold mine?
Gold mine?
What gold mine, señor?
You know, the one in the mountains.
In our mountains?
We never had a gold mine around here.
Say, come to think of it, it was a silver mine.
Whatever happened to it?
We have no silver mine either.
I mean in the old days.
Not at any time.
Where did you hear of this gold and silver?
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk.
Toro.
Toro.
¡Toro!
Come on, little bull!
Toro.
Toro.
You do anything to me and I'll kill you while you are doing it.
You almost took my eye out!
Let me go. Let me go!
Oh, you bite me and I'll bite you!
I got a good mind to throw you in the water.
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!
Shut up. Shut up!
Where are the others?
I'll never tell you.
Look what I found.
Who is she?
From our village.
So that's where they were.
You hid them.
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.
They're afraid. She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.
Farmers! Their families told them we'd rape them.
Well, we might.
In my opinion, though, you might have given us the benefit of the doubt.
But... just as you please.
As long as you were out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?
What for? Leave them out there.
Let Calvera find them. He'll take good care of them.
Bring them in.
Show him the way.
Ma'am.
Come on, little angel
Gently, boy.
Gently.
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for you señoritas to fix dinner for us.
How's the food?
Great.
Chicken enchiladas, carne asada and Spanish rice. Looks good.
These people really know how to cook.
Dig in, there's tons of it.
Do you know what the villagers have been eating since we got here?
Tortillas and a few beans, that's all.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Do you have an older, grateful sister at home?
No, sir. Many thanks.
You're welcome.
Many thanks.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two... three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Squeeze.
Miguel, didn't I tell you to squeeze? Hm?
Just like when you're milking a goat, Miguel.
It's that I get excited.
Well, don't get excited!
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.
All right... squeeze.
Squeeze!
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.
You take the gun like this and you use it like a club. All right?
Right.
Flaco!
Muchas gracias.
Good afternoon.
Howdy.
We've come to move you into the village.
Move into the village?! Me?!
Everybody who lives outside.
Oh, no.
We can't protect you out here.
Rojas is makin' room for you in his home.
Rojas?! His conversation would bore me to death!
Yeah, well... maybe somebody else?
They are all farmers.
Farmers talk of nothing but fertilizer and women.
I've never shared their enthusiasm for fertilizer.
As for women... I became indifferent when I was 83.
I am staying here.
Yeah, well... what are you gonna do when Calvera comes?
At my age, a little excitement is welcome.
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?
Bullets cost money.
All right. Have it your way.
You worry about yourself.
Are you ready for him?
What if he comes now, eh?
It's like that fella who fell off a ten-storey building.
What about him?
As he was falling, people on each floor heard him say "So far, so good."
So far, so good!
First of all, they'll see that ditch.
More water for the corn.
Awful lot of new walls.
Civic improvements.
Hey, Chris... what about that net, eh?
Well, if he's not looking for it...
If he rides in unsuspecting.
If, brother!
If!
Yeah.
Yeah!
I should have guessed. When my men didn't come back, I should have guessed.
How many of you did they hire?
Enough.
New wall!
There are lots of new walls.
All around.
They won't keep me out.
They were built to keep you in.
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!
All forty of us!
By these three.
Or is it four? They couldn't afford to hire more than that.
We come cheaper by the bunch.
Five!
Even five won't give us too much trouble.
There won't be any trouble
If you ride on.
Ride on?
I'm going into the hills for the winter.
Where am I going to get food for my men?
Buy it or grow it.
Or maybe even work for it!
Seven!
Somehow, I don't think you've solved my problem.
Solving your problems isn't our line.
We deal in lead, friend.
So do I. We're in the same business.
Only as competitors.
Why not as partners?
Suppose I offer you equal shares?
In what?
Everything. To the last grain.
And the people in the village?
What about them?
I leave it to you.
Can men of our profession worry about things like that?
May even be sacrilegious.
If God didn't want them sheared, he would not have made them sheep.
What do you say?
Ride on.
You hear that, Sotero?
You hear what he said?
Ride on.
To me!
You tell him to ride on before I become angry.
Him, and the others!
Because, if I leave with empty hands... everybody in this village will answer to me...when I come back!
You won't come back.
Why not?
You won't have any guns.
Take them off right now and drop them.
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!
I leave these people a little bit extra and they hire these men to make trouble.
It shows you... sooner or later, you must answer for every good deed.
You were safe.
I was face to face with them as they rode toward me.
Ten of them, screaming.
The last time you told it, it was five!
They multiply like rabbits!
Ten. Ten!
They got a good kick in the behind.
If they try it again, they'll get another!
We'll tear them to pieces.
We'll bury them all.
Calvera too!
Any sign of 'em?
No.
That is bad luck.
Can you imagine? I knew him when he was a mouse!
I was never so frightened in my life.
My knees were like jelly.
I would never have guessed it.
Well, he'll leave us alone from now on.
- You think so?
- Of course.
He'll go away.
There are other villages... other villages that don't sting the way we do.
Señor!
Neighbors...
I drink to our friends.
They armed us, fought at our sides, and will forever live in our hearts.
They haven't gone, then.
See the gun flashin'?
No.
I make it two of them.
Three.
Fool kid's gonna get his head blown off.
Chico! Stay put.
Three?
Three.
O'Reilly? Do you see them?
No... They're too far back in the trees.
- Chris.
- Yeah?
Try and make it up to those rocks.
I'll cover you.
Chico... cover the back door.
Get back!
Get back! Go on!
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?
Get down. Now stay down!
Crazy kids! You might have been hurt.
So might you.
It's not the same thing.
This is my work.
It's our work, too.
Everyone tells us "Hide! Get back!
Stay out of sight!"
But we're not afraid.
He's very brave.
It's the truth.
So is he. We all are - every boy in the village.
We had a meeting and we drew straws and we got you.
You got me? What d'you mean, you got me?
If you get killed, we avenge you.
And we see to it that there's always fresh flowers on your grave.
That's a mighty big comfort
I told you he would appreciate that.
Don't you kids be too disappointed if your plans don't work out.
We won't. If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.
Maybe even happier.
Maybe.
Can you see them?
No.
Do your... hands sweat before a fight?
Every time.
Mine are sweatin' now.
Funny...
Hands sweat... mouth is dry.
You'd think it would be the other way around.
Does my... talking annoy you?
It's because I'm...
I'm frightened, you know?
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish you'd given your crops to Calvera?
Yes... and no.
Both at the same time.
Yes, when I think of... of what he might do.
No, when I remember the feeling in my chest this morning... as I saw him run away.
From us.
Man... that's a feeling worth dying for!
Have you ever... felt something like that?
Not for a long, long time.
I... envy you.
What are you doing here?
You shouldn't do things like you did.
Go back.
You mustn't take foolish chances.
All right, I won't.
But go back.
Does it hurt?
What?
No.
I'm sorry I did it, but I thought...
You know what I thought.
Yes, yes. I know.
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.
He says "Stay away from those men."
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."
He's right. Do you know that? He's right.
Well... go back home now.
He is wrong.
Well... go home anyway... before he finds out you're here.
He already knows.
He said he'd punish me for being so shameless.
But I don't care.
They got them.
They got them all!
Result.
Do you think they'll try that again?
I doubt it.
For all they know, we're still out there ready to jump them.
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?
Did you think it would be that easy?
What do we do now?
Well, what do you say?
Me?
We work for you, you know.
What else is there to do but... wait?
It's Calvera's move.
Right.
Now you'd better replace the guards.
They must be tired.
- If you were Calvera...
- Yes?
You'd go away, wouldn't you?
If you'd paid the price we make him pay.
Yes, I would, only...
Only what?
Only I'm not Calvera.
Take the rifles and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.
Now, let's get out there on duty.
Food, woman.
They'll be hungry.
That was... that was the greatest...
New hat for you, sonny.
Hey!
How do I look?
Big improvement.
You know what? They'll make up a song about you and this hat.
Villages like this make up a song about every big thing.
They sing them for years.
Do you think it's worth it?
Don't you?
It's only a matter of knowing how to shoot a gun.
Nothing big about that.
Hey... how can you talk like this?
Your gun has got you everything you have.
Isn't that true?
Mm?
Well, isn't that true?
Yeah, sure. Everything.
After a while you can call bartenders by their first name.
Maybe 200 of 'em.
Rented rooms you live in: 500. Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.
Home: none. Wife: none. Kids:
None.
Prospects: zero.
Suppose I left anything out?
Yeah.
Places you are tied down to: none.
People with a hold on you: none.
Men you step aside for: none.
Insults swallowed:
None.
Enemies: none.
No enemies?
Alive.
Well! This is the kind of arithmetic I like!
Yeah, so did I at your age.
Give these to someone who knows how to use them.
Yeah.
Why don't you ask Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?
Yes, do that. And I'll write a song for you myself.
Andrés, Lorenzo and
Felipe never came back.
That's three.
Armando in the plaza.
That's four.
And Jorge and Memo in the pass, where they were caught by that cursed net.
Damn them!
Five and six.
Emilio going over the wall.
Seven.
José near the fountain.
Eight.
Gregorio near the fountain.
That's nine.
Nine.
Fortuno by the water ditch.
Rico in the fields, where they slashed him to pieces!
That's... 10 and 11.
Go on.
Talk.
Talk! Talk!
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.
There's still plenty of us here... to make them pay.
Our friends down below.
Please, no!
It's all right.
You're all right.
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.
Have no fear.
"Have no fear"?
My very words.
10,000 times a day.
Señor, don't punish yourself.
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.
Until the day you lose your nerve.
You feel it.
And then you wait... for the bullet in the gun that is faster than yours.
Señor, don't.
And the lies you tell, to fool yourself.
No enemies:
Alive.
I have lost count of my enemies.
But you're with friends now.
Yes.
The final, supreme idiocy:
Comin' here to hide.
The deserter... hidin' out in the middle of a battlefield.
One.
There was a time when I woulda caught all three.
We know what fear is.
We live with it all our lives.
Only the dead are without fear.
Rico!
Rico!
One minute, Mother!
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and then we'll be back on duty.
All right, Bernardo?
Yes, but not you, Juan.
You're too young. Come on.
Bernardo O'Reilly!
You've been adopted.
Yeah, it's my real name.
Mexican on one side, Irish on the other, and me in the middle.
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.
See? All three, right side up.
Think you can do it?
Of course. That's very easy.
Would you... care to make a friendly wager?
A little bet?
You know we have no money.
It doesn't have to be money.
Whatever you have hidden away, buried out where Calvera can't find it.
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?!
Yeah. They tell me a lotta precious stones have been dug out of the mountains.
Opals, emeralds... sapphires.
Oh, yes. Yes, that's very true.
There's no denyin' it.
Well, then!
No! When you're finished, they should all be right side up.
Let me try it again, eh?
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?
As you say, señor, in the mountains.
Where in the mountains?
That I couldn't tell you.
There! I got it!
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?
Because I never have found any precious stones.
Wait. You mean Aztec treasure buried in the hills, from when the Spaniards came?
That's exactly what I mean. Aztec treasure.
Have you found some?
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.
I'd be living in a big city, in a palace.
Then tell me this...how come
Calvera keeps hangin' around here?
Calvera... We've seen the end of him.
He'll be gone in the morning.
No, he will not.
He won't go anywhere.
Why do you say that?
Calvera isn't worried about food for winter.
He's worried about the food his men haven't eaten for the last three days.
The price of corn is going up.
They're starving.
How do you know?
Starving and broke.
How do you know?!
Oh...
I've been up there.
Well, we'd better be ready for them.
Because they gotta die or win.
Válgame Dios if they do win.
They won't win.
Are you God, that you can say for sure?
We're surrounded. Outnumbered.
What are we to do?
Keep on fighting.
Do you want to see us killed off one by one?
That is not what you were hired for.
Once you start, there's no stopping.
You understood that, and I told him!
I don't care.
Go away. All of you. Get on your horses and go.
Let Calvera have the food.
Give him what he wants.
At least we'll be alive.
Quiet! And listen to me!
No! It is easy for them to say fight.
They have no sons, no daughters, no wives.
Go. Now, before it's too late.
Is that what you want?
Answer me!
Who's for going on and who's for giving up?
I want to know now.
Don't be fools! You'll turn our village into a graveyard.
Tell them to go. It's the only thing for them to do.
I'll tell you what I can do.
I can kill the first man who so much as whispers a word about giving up.
The very first man, so help me, I'll blow his head off!
We started this fight... and we're gonna finish it!
With or without you.
I'm not sayin' we bit off more than we can chew... but we oughta talk about what we're gonna do.
We start acting like we had some good sense.
We figured to raise the ante just enough to make Calvera play someplace else.
We figured wrong.
We're the only game in town.
A man can't call 'em all.
I didn't say he could.
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend with the breeze... or you break.
D'you wanna go?
There comes a time to get out. The village will be no worse off than before we came.
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.
It's not the kind courts enforce.
That's just the kind you've gotta keep.
A noble thought, but the way things are right now...
I don't know.
The odds are too high.
- Much too high.
- Then we go?
No.
We lower the odds.
Right up into the hills... past the men on guard... right into their camp.
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with them, we discussed a few things.
We... you know...
All of a sudden, there was Calvera himself.
Right beside me. When I brought back the news... you should have seen the look I got from Britt...and from Chris.
They have seen a thing or two in their time, and done them too.
They're not men you can impress easily. Oh, no.
But when they looked at me, I knew I was one of them at last.
Well... you'd better take a look at me, too.
Am I the kind of man who'd live in a place like this?
Digging my life away out in the fields?
Me, a farmer...a peasant?
You know what I'm saying?
Wherever they go
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others...
I go with them.
And if you think you, or anything you do, could make me change my mind, forget it.
I want you to understand that.
I... want you to understand that... this... will get you nothing but this.
We're going to hit Calvera... maybe drive off some of his horses.
Then if he attacks, he'll be on foot.
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.
You can count on me.
I know I can.
They've left to hit the village.
No.
We'd have heard shots.
They've gone.
Good evening.
You'll be dead. All of you!
Like that!
If that's what you want.
Do we have a choice?
Of course.
Of course.
Sit down.
Let's talk.
Things are turned around now?
You're wondering how.
Your friends, they don't like you very much any more.
You force them to make too many decisions.
With me... only one decision.
Do what I say.
You should not be surprised.
My good friend Sotero, he arranged to let me come in.
Understand?
Well, anyway... to business!
I could kill you all.
You agree?
Well... you don't disagree.
Anyway, I don't want to kill you.
Why so generous?
Practical. They hear about it up north.
Maybe some friends of yours make more trouble for me.
A man who never wants no trouble.
We have a saying here.
A thief who steals from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.
All right, what does that leave?
Only one thing. I pardon you.
Ride on.
Just like that?
Mm, just like...
I'll make it easy for you. You want food?
Give them food.
Water? All right. Water.
Horses? Saddled and waiting.
Guns?
The guns... the gun belts, you take off and put here now.
What about these people?
What happens to these people will happen whether I kill you first or not.
Just a little gesture?
To show these people who the real boss is.
You go, then I give you the guns back.
I know you won't use those guns against me.
Only a crazy man makes the same mistake twice.
I don't understand why a man like you took the job in the first place. Hm? Why?
I wonder myself.
No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his clothes off and jumped on a cactus.
I asked him the same question: why?
And?
He said "It seemed to be a good idea at the time."
Good!
Right.
Go get your clothes, your saddlebags.
Anything you want, take it.
Your friends in there owe you at least that much.
Santos, pick up the carbines.
Cirillo, the guns.
You know, the first time I took a job as a hired gun... a fella told me "Vin, you can't afford to care."
There's your problem.
One thing I don't need is somebody telling me my problem.
Like I said before, that's your problem.
You got involved in this village and the people in it.
Do you ever get tired of hearing yourself talk?
The reason I understand your problem so well... is that I walked into the same trap myself.
Yeah.
The first day we got here,
I started thinking... maybe I could put my gun away and settle down and get a little land... raise some cattle.
The things that these people know about me wouldn't work against me.
I... just didn't want you to think you were the only sucker in town.
Can we go with you, Bernardo?
No.
You like us, don't you?
I guess so.
You're one of us, aren't you?
Yeah, I'm one of us all right.
Take us with you! Please?!
No!
We're ashamed to live here.
Our fathers are... cowards.
Don't ever say that again about your fathers.
They are not cowards!
You think I am brave because I carry a gun.
Your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility.
For you, your brothers, your sisters and your mothers.
This responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton.
It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground.
Nobody says they have to do it.
They do it because they love you and they want to.
I have never had this kind of courage.
Running a farm... working like a mule, with no guarantee what will become of it... this is bravery.
That's why I never even started anything like that.
That's why I never will.
You'll do much better on the other side of the border.
There you can steal cattle, hold up trains.
All you have to face is a sheriff, a marshal.
Once I rob a bank in Texas.
Your government got after me with a whole army. A whole army!
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?
In Texas, only Texans can rob banks!
¡Adios!
¡Adios!
I could have told you they'd sell us out.
Farmers...
Farmers!
No honor, no loyalty...nothin'.
All they care about is their precious crops and the miserable dirt they dig in.
I hate 'em.
I hate 'em all.
Sure you hate them.
Because you come from a village just like that one.
You yourself are a farmer.
Yes.
Yes, I'm one of them.
But who made us the way we are? Hm?
Men with guns.
Men like Calvera and... men like you.
And now me.
So what d'you expect us to be?
Nobody throws me my own guns and says run. Nobody.
It took me a long, long time to learn my elbow from a hot rock.
Right now, I belong back in that border town, sleepin' on white sheets.
I think I'll ride back to that village.
You're crazy, all of ya! They won't lift a finger to help. Think of the odds.
Harry... nobody's asking you to go back.
Ride on, Harry. It's all right.
Bet your sweet life, I will!
Come on, Lee. They wanna get killed?
Let 'em.
Go ahead, Lee. You don't owe anything to anybody.
Except to myself.
Except to myself.
You're crazy! All of ya!
Come on. Ya!
Hold on, Chris,
I'll get ya outta there!
Chris...
Yes, Harry?
I'd hate to die a sucker.
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on a lotta corn and chilli peppers.
There was something else all the time, wasn't there?
Yes, Harry. You had it pegged right all along.
I knew it.
What was it?
Gold.
Sacks of it.
Oh... sounds beautiful!
How much?
At least a half a million.
My cut woulda been what?
About 70,000.
I'll be damned!
Maybe you won't be.
You came back.
For a place like this.
Why?
A man like you?!
Why?
Bernardo! Bernardo!
No. No, get back.
Go on! Get back.
We didn't... We didn't mean to do it.
We didn't mean to do it.
You see?
I told you.
You see your fathers?
What's my name?
Bernardo.
Bernardo!
You're damn right.
You could stay, you know.
They wouldn't be sorry to have you stay.
They won't be sorry to see us go, either.
Yes. The fighting is over.
Your work is done.
For them, each season has its tasks.
If there were a season for gratitude, they'd show it more.
We didn't get any more than we expected, old man.
Only the farmers have won.
They remain forever.
They are like the land itself.
You helped to rid them of Calvera... the way a strong wind helps rid them of locusts.
You are like the wind... blowing over the land and passing on.
God be with you.
Adios.
Adios.
Adios.
The old man was right.
Only the farmers won.
We lost.
We always lose.

AT YOUR ORDERS, SIR.
MY GENERAL'’’S
COMPLIMENTS, SIR.
AND MINE TO HIM, SIR.
LEE ARNOLD.
HURRY UP. WE HAVEN'’
’T GOT ALL DAY.
MY PLEASURE,
MR. ARNOLD.
YOUR HEALTH.
AND YOURS.
[FOOTSTEPS]...
...10 GUNS,
MY CAPTAIN.
Officer: PREPARE TO MOVE OUT.
20,000 PESOS
IN GOLD.
WE NEED EVERY GUN WE CAN
GET AGAINST THIS VILLA.
YOU MEAN
HE FIGHTS THAT WELL?
HE'’’S A TERRIBLE
FIGHTER.
THAT'’’S THE TROUBLE
WITH HIM.
PANCHO VILLA...
CRAWLS OUT
FROM UNDER HIS ROCK,
SHOOTS YOU IN THE BACK,
ROBS YOU,
AND THEN RUNS
AND HIDES AGAIN.
HE'’’S A MENACE TO MEXIC
O, BELIEVE ME.
CAPTAIN...
Officer: GROUP IS ALL READY, SIR.
YOU SUPPOSE I COULD BORROW
A COUPLE OF YOUR MEN
TO GET THE WHEEL
BACK ON MY PLANE?
I'’’D LIKE TO BE ABLE
TO TAKE OFF.
MY REGRETS,
MR. ARNOLD,
BUT MY GENERAL
HAS ORDERED ME
TO RETURN WITH THESE GUNS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
FIRST VILLAGE SOUTH OF US
IS CHUPADERO.
THEY HAVE
AN EXCELLENT BLACKSMITH.
HE FORGED CAISSON
UNDERPINNINGS FOR VILLA,
SO I'’’M SURE
HE CAN HELP YOU.
[MULE FOOTSTEPS]
MY REGRETS,
MR. ARNOLD,
BUT IT'’’S THE BEST
I CAN OFFER.
I'’’LL TAKE IT.
ONE OTHER THING...
THE VILLAGERS--THEY'’’RE
WHAT WE CALL PACIÍÍFICOS.
THEY DON'’’T FIGHT FOR HIM, BUT
THEY'’’RE SYMPATHETIC TO VILLA.
IT WOULD BE WISE NOT
TO TELL '’’EM WHY YOU ARE HERE.
[SIGHS]
Officer: GROUP, FORWARD...
MARCH.
THEY WON'’’T HURT YOU,
MR. ARNOLD.
JUST DON'’’T STAY TOO LONG,
THAT'’’S ALL.
SO, FIX YOUR AIRPLANE,
COME BACK,
AND FLY FOR US.
MUCH MORE MONEY.
Capt. Ramirez: HAH.
[EXCITED YELLING]
THIS IS MR. ARNOLD.
HE'’’S A GRINGO
FROM EL PASO,
HE FLIES IN THE AIR,
AND I AM TAKING HIM
TO THE BLACKSMITH.
HE'’’S A GRINGO
FROM EL PASO.
FINA, I AM TAKING HIM
TO SEE YOUR FATHER.
[CHILDREN YELLING]...
...AND I AM TAKING HIM
TO THE BLACKSMITH.
THIS IS MR. ARNOLD.
HE'’’S A GRINGO
FROM EL PASO,
AND I AM TAKING HIM
TO THE BLACKSMITH.
HO...
I'’’M THE BLACKSMITH.
MR. ARNOLD,
THIS IS
LUIS GONZALES.
HOW DO YOU DO?
MOVE. HEY, HEY.
AHH.
HEY, GET AWAY
FROM THERE.
YOU WANT IT
TO BITE YOU?
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN
AN AIRPLANE BEFORE?
WELL,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
OH, I AM SORRY,
SENOR ARNOLD,
BUT NOTHING MORE
CAN BE DONE TILL TOMORROW.
BUT THIS ISN'’’T
EXACTLY MY AIRPLANE.
YOU SEE, I JUST, UH,
BORROWED IT KIND OF,
AND IF I DON'’’T
GET IT BACK--
SENOR ARNOLD,
DO NOT WORRY.
YOU MAY NOT BE AT HOME,
BUT TONIGHT YOU WILL
BE IN YOUR OWN HOUSE.
COME.
BUT HE'’’LL COME
LOOKIN'’’--
COME. COME.
COME. COME.
SOMETHING DISPLEASES
YOU, MR. ARNOLD?
OH, NO,
EVERYTHING'’’S FINE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
JUST GREAT.
COFFEE, MR. ARNOLD?
PLEASE.
FINA, COFFEE.
CIGARETTE.
ALLOW ME.
OH, NO.
HO HO.
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
¿¿BONITO?
Luis: IT'’’S ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW,
MR. ARNOLD,
IT'’’S TOO BAD YOU DIDN'
’’T HAVE ENGINE TROUBLE
A LITTLE EARLIER.
YOU MISSED
A GREAT MOMENT
IN THE LIFE
OF OUR VILLAGE.
PANCHO VILLA
CAME HERE TODAY.
WELL, I DON'’’T KNOW
MUCH ABOUT HIM.
YOU KNOW, FROM THE STATES,
HE'’’S JUST KNOWN AS A BANDIT.
Luis: NO, NO.
PANCHO VILLA IS
NO LONGER A BANDIT.
HE'’’S NOT?
Bonito: NO.
NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.
HE--HE IS FIGHTING
FOR THE REVOLUTION.
THE COLORADOS,
THEY ARE TRYING TO
DESTROY THE REVOLUTION.
THEYARE TRYING
TO TAKE AWAY
OUR PRESIDENT MADERO.
THAT'’’S, UH, TYPICAL
OF THE COLORADOS.
[LAUGHING]
YOU ARE A WISE MAN,
MR. ARNOLD.
BELIEVE ME,
IF YOU EVER
SEE SOLDIERS
UNDER A RED FLAG,
RIDE THE OTHER WAY.
THE COLORADOS
ARE THE CRUELEST MEN
IN MEÉÉXICO.
Luis: IS GOOD?
IT'’’S VERY GOOD.
[LAUGHS]
BONITO, WAKE UP.
LOOK.
ISN'’’T THAT MY SHIRT
FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER?
MUST BE.
THOSE ARE MY PANTS.
WELL, DON'’’T JUST SIT
HERE. GO AND GET THEM.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT
TO WEAR TOMORROW, WEEDS?
PULL, BURRO. PULL.
HEY, HEY.
IT WORKED.
[LAUGHING]
YES, IT WORKED.
IT'’’S GOOD, HUH
GOOD?
THAT'’’S BETTER THAN GOOD.
IT'’’S THE BEST.
AY, COMPADRE.
[FAKES WINCE]...
...[LAUGHING]
HOW CAN I PAY YOU?
NOTHING.
YOU ARE MY FRIEND.
YOU ARE MY GUEST.
[LAUGHING]
NOW...
WHERE I COME FROM...
WHEN YOU'’’RE A GUEST...
YOU HAVE TO BRING
A HOUSE GIFT.
THAT'’’S THE WAY.
SO...
FOR THE HOUSE.

YOUR HOUSE ALWAYS.
I BELIEVE I'’’D LIKE THAT.
[ROOSTER CROWS]

YOU SEE THIS WALL?
IF YOU RUN REAL FAST

YOU CAN GO FREE.
[PRISONERS SHOUTING]
DON'’’T WORRY TOO MUCH,
BECAUSE I AM
A VERY BAD SHOT.
WHY ARE YOU NERVOUS?
YOU THINK I'’’M GOING
TO SHOOT YOU?
BUT YOU WOULDN'’’T

THAT'’’S RIGHT.
AND I'’’M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN FLY THAT AIRPLANE.
IT CAN BE
VERY USEFUL TO YOU.
VERY USEFUL.
FIERRO...
YOU THINK THE GRINGO
WANTS TO FLY FOR US?
I'’’LL FLY FOR YOU.
I HOPE HE CAN FLY

WELL,

LET THE COLORADOS

YOU MEAN TO SAY HE WAS
HERE IN TIME TO PREVENT IT?
WELL...IT IS LIKE THIS.

I'’’LL TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.
WHILE YOU WERE TEACHING
THE VILLAGERS
TO HATE THIS AFTERNOON,
SHE WAS BEING RAPED
BY CAPTAIN RAMIREZ,
SO SHE DOESN'’’T WANT
ANY MAN TONIGHT.
IT MAY JUST BE POSSIBLE
THAT SHE FEELS
THAT NO DECENT MAN
WANTS HER.
IT WASN'’’T JUST
THAT SOLDIER, YOU KNOW.
IT WAS YOU, TOO.
YOU'’’RE RESPONSIBLE.
YOU MIGHT JUST AS WELL
HAVE RAPED HER YOURSELF.

GOING WITH YOU.
WHAT? NOW,
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
NOT WITH--
CHIEF, IT'’’S TOUGH ENOU
GH UP THERE AS IT IS.
NOW, YOU GO UP THERE ALONE,
YOU COULD FLY AWAY.
YOU TRY THAT
WITH FIERRO...
FIERRO WILL SHOOT YOU.
OH? AND
WITHOUT A PILOT,
WHAT'’’S FIERRO
GONNA DO?
FIERRO WILL SHOOT YOU.
FIERRO.
FIERRO,
YOU GO WITH HIM.
NO.
FIERRO...
WHAT DO
YOU MEAN 'NO'?
I MEAN...NO.
NO.
WELL, WHY NOT?
BECAUSE...
BECAUSE I DON'’’T THINK
HE IS A GOOD PILOT.
YOU'’’RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
BUT IT DOESN'’’T MATTER.
NO?
IF HE IS NO GOOD,
YOU SHOOT HIM
AND FLY IT YOURSELF.
ME?
WHY, ANY CHILD COULD
LEARN HOW TO FLY
ONE OF THESE THINGS.
AHH, YOU THINK SO?
YES.
YOU COULD FLY THIS?
OF COURSE.
THEN FLY IT.
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
YOU CAN'’’T FLY THIS THING.
YOU TEACH ME. NOW.
CHIEF, IT TAKES YEARS
TO LEARN HOW TO FLY
AN AIRPLANE.
YOU'’’LL PROBABLY--
YOU'’’LL CRACK UP
BEFORE YOU GET IT
OFF THE GROUND.
T.
YOU BETTER HOPE I DON'’’
THIS MACHINE IS ALL
THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE.
TEACH GOOD.
THAT'’’S FINE.
NOW,
WE'’’RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THE MAGNETO
ANYMORE, CHIEF.
NOW WE'’’RE LOOKING
AT THE ALTIMETER.
THE WHAT?
ALTIMETER.
ALTIMETER.
THAT'’’S RIGHT.
ALTIMETER. RIGHT. HURRY.
I'’’LL TELL YOU WHAT , CHIEF.
LET'’’S TRY THE WHOL
E THING ONE MORE TI--
NOW, GRINGO.
RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
MAGNETO SET?
Villa: YEAH.
[STOPS ENGINE]
HA HA. ¡¡VIVA VILLA.
[ALL CHEERING]...
...¡¡VIVA VILLA.
[FIRING GUNS IN THE AIR]
DON'’’T DO THIS.
I DON'’’T LIKE IT.
I WILL SHOOT YOU.
THIS IS PARRAL,
AND...
THIS IS PARRAL.
THIS IS
WHERE WE ARE.
AND RIGHT HERE...
THERE'’’S
A TROOP TRAIN
FULL OF TROOPS
COMING TOWARD US.
MAYBE 400.
WHO COOKED THIS?
ME, CHIEF.
NO, YOU DIDN'’’T.
NO, I DIDN'’’T.
COOK IT.
YEAH, CHIEF.
THIS IS PARRAL.
THIS IS US.
AND THE TRAIN...
HEADED NORTH.
YET THE COLORADOS KNOW
THAT HUERTA IS SOUTH.
NOW, THEY HAVE TO
HOLD PARRAL
TO CONTROL
ALL THE SUPPLY LINES.
YET THEY SEND A TRAIN
FULL OF TROOPS
ON A RIDE, NOT SOUTH
TOWARD HUERTA,
BUT NORTH TOWARD US.
WORRIES ME.
THEY ARE NOT AFRAID
OF HUERTA.
WORRIES ME.
MY ORDERS SAY DON'’’T ATTACK
PARRAL, LEAVE IT TO HUERTA.
HUERTA HAS AN ARMY
IN FRONT OF PARRAL,
YET HE WON'’’T MAKE
A MOVE TO TAKE IT.
THE ORDERS DON'’’T SAY Y
OU CAN'’’T TAKE THE TRAIN.
400 COLORADOS.
YOU'’’RE RIGHT, CHIEF.
THAT'’’S TOO MANY.
TOO MANY?
NOT WITH YOUR HELP.
MY HELP?
NO, NO, CHIEF.
I'’’VE DONE MY JOB.
IT'’’S ALL UP TO YOU
FROM NOW ON.
RAWHIDE, PIECES OF IRON,
DYNAMITE--
WE LIGHT THEM,
THROW THEM AT THE ENEMY,
BAROOM.
YOU'’’RE GOING TO DROP
THEM ON THE COLORADOS.
FROM THE AIR.
NO, NO, NO, CHIEF.
NOW, LET ME EXPLAIN
SOMETHING TO YOU.
AN AIRPLANE IS NOT
USED FOR FIGHTING.
IT'’’S JUST TO DETERMINE
THE SIZE
AND THE STRENGTH
OF THE ENEMY.
WHO SAID?
WELL, UH, IT JUST
ISN'’’T DONE, CHIEF.
WHY NOT?
WELL,
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
YOU GOTTA LIGHT
THOSE THINGS
IN THE AIR
IN AN OPEN COCKPIT.
SMOKE CIGARS.
WELL, EVEN IF YOU
COULD DO THAT,
THEY'’’D EXPLODE
LONG BEFORE
THEY HIT THE GROUND.
THERE'’’S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO
ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
YES, THERE IS.
FLY LOW.
CHIEF, I SAID I'’’D FLY,
NOT FIGHT.
WHAT'’’S THE DIFFERENCE?
ABOUT $20,000.
IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
I'’’VE GOTTA FLY
REAL LOW.
THEY COULD KNOCK ME
DOWN WITH A ROCK.
THAT'’’S A PRETTY
EXPENSIVE AIRPLANE.
Fierro: WHY DO YOU ARGUE WITH HIM?
IT'’’S ALWAYS A QUESTION
OF MONEY WITH YOU,
ISN'’’T IT, GRINGO?
WELL, JUST LIKE YOU,
CHIEF.
FIRST A BANDIT,
AND THEN LATER
WHEN I BECOME
A BIG ENOUGH BANDIT,
THEY MIGHT CALL ME
A HERO,
AN IDEALIST,
JUST LIKE YOU.
YOU'’’LL GET PAID.
HOW MUCH?
25 PESOS
FOR EVERY COLORADO YOU KILL.
P.
THAT'’’S PRETTY CHEA
LOOK, GRINGO,
THIS IS A CHEAP WAR.
NEXT YEAR,
I'’’LL HAVE MORE MONEY,
WE'’’LL HAVE A BIGGER WAR.
ALL RIGHT?
OK.
ALL CLEAR.
COME ON.
[AIRPLANE APPROACHING]...
...¡¡RAÀÀPIDO.
Riders: ¡¡VIVA MEXICO.
¡¡VIVA--
Fina: BONITO.
YOU, YOU, AND YOU,

LINE UP.
GO LIKE THIS.
GOOD, GOOD,
VERY GOOD.
IT WORKS. 3 MORE.
NOW WE CAN TAKE PARRAL.
BUT, CHIEF, WITH
YOUR PERMISSION,
DIDN'’’T
GENERAL HUERTA SAY
NOT TO ATTACK
PARRAL?
NOT TO ATTACK PARRAL.
HE DIDN'’’T SAY
I COULDN'’’T GO THERE.
SEND A MESSAGE TO
THE HEADQUARTERS IN PARRAL.
WE ARE UNDER
HEAVY ATTACK BY...
PANCHO VILLA.
REQUEST PERMISSION
TO RETURN AT ONCE.
SIGNED JOSE OCHOA,
MAJOR, COMMANDING.
YOU SAW WHAT
HIS PLANE CAN DO.
I WANT YOU
TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH HIM.
HIS MOTHER
SHOULD HAVE SAT ON HIM
WHEN HE WAS BORN.
I DON'’’T LIKE HIM.
DO I LIKE HUERTA? NO.
BUT HE'’’S HELPING ME
WIN THE WAR.
I THINK.
HEY, FIERRO, I'’’M NOT
ASKING YOU TO MARRY HIM.
JUST MAKE HIM HAPPY.
WE DON'’’T NEED HIM.
NO?
NO.
YOU COULD FLY
THE PLANE.
ME?
SURE. ANY CHILD
COULD FLY IT.
I WILL DO
AS YOU SAY.
HEH.
JORGE.
YEAH, CHIEF?
WHO COOKED THIS?
ME, CHIEF.
NO, YOU DIDN'’’T
NO, I DIDN'’’T.
COOK IT.
[COINS CLINK]
HELLO, GRINGO.
FOR YOU.
VILLA SAYS
YOU DID VERY WELL.
IS SOMETHING WRONG?
ISN'’’T THIS
WHAT YOU FIGHT FOR?
I DON'’’T FIGHT FOR FUN.
MAYBE YOU THINK
IT'’’S NOT REAL.
LOOK.
IT'’’S REAL.
VERY REAL, MY FRIEND.
I MAY BE
A LOT OF THINGS,
D.
BUT I DON'’’T REALLY
BELIEVE I'’’M YOUR FRIEN
I'’’M TRYING
TO LIKE YOU, GRINGO.
STOP FOR INSPECTION.
INSPECT YOUR MOTHER.
SWITCH US TO THE STATION
IMMEDIATELY, LIEUTENANT.
AH, SWITCH, NO.
MY ORDERS
ARE TO INSPECT--
DO THAT FIRST,
PANCHO VILLA WILL BE
SHOOTING FURROWS
UP AND DOWN YOUR SPINE.
PANCHO VILLA?
PANCHO VILLA.
[SHOUTING IN SPANISH]...
...¡¡VIVA VILLA.
¡¡VIVA VILLA.
¡¡VIVA VILLA.
¡¡VIVA VILLA.
VILLA HAS TAKEN PARRAL.
HE DIDN'’’T ATTACK.
HE DIDN'’’T FIRE
A SINGLE SHOT.
THE CITY
FELL INTO HIS ARMS.
HEH HEH.
LIKE A WOMAN.
WHY DO YOU LOOK
SO UNHAPPY, MAJOR?
THIS IS A GREAT VICTORY
FOR OUR COUNTRY,
FOR PRESIDENT MADERO,
FOR THE REVOLUTION.
IS IT NOT?
YES, MY GENERAL.
THEN LOOK HAPPY.
COLONEL, DETACH
YOUR TROOP TRANSPORT CARS.
I WANT TO BE IN PARRAL
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
BUT GENERAL
HUERTA--
YES?
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
ISN'’’T IT DANGEROUS
TO FACE VILLA
WITHOUT YOUR ARMY?
DO YOU THINK
IT'’’S LESS DANGEROUS
TO FACE VILLA
WITH MY ARMY?
THE ONE PREDICTABLE THING
ABOUT PANCHO VILLA...
IS THAT HE WILL OBEY
PRESIDENT MADERO.
AND I HOLD ORDERS
FROM MADERO.
YES, MY GENERAL.
GRINGO.
YOU GET
THE MONEY?
I GOT IT, YEAH.
DON'’’T GO, GRINGO.
DON'’’T GO.
STAY WITH ME.
YOU FOUGHT WELL TODAY.
WHAT IS YOUR NAME,
SENORITA?
MY NAME IS EMILITA,
MY GENERAL.
EMILITA?
MM-HMM.
EMILITA AND PANCHO.
SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.
THINK ABOUT IT.
CHIEF.
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'’’M IN LOVE WITH YOU.
CHIEF.
BUT I HAVE A MAN,
MY GENERAL.
YOU'’’RE MARRIED?
NO.
HEY, CHIEF.
THEN IT MUST BE
THAT HE DOESN'’’T
LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.
BUT I LOVE YOU.
AND I WILL MARRY YOU.
URBINA, GET A PRIEST.
OHH.
[TALKING AT ONCE]
SEE, GRINGO,
ALL WOMEN
WANT TO GET MARRIED,
NO MATTER WHAT
THEY SAY, RIGHT?
NOW, YOU KNOW
AND I KNOW
THAT THESE MARRIAGES
DON'’’T MEAN A THING.
I DIDN'’’T KNOW.
BUT IT
MAKES THEM HAPPY.
IT'’’S THE 11th TIME FOR ME, I THINK.
THE ONLY THING I WANT TO DO
IS MAKE THEM HAPPY.
THERE IS NO HARM IN THAT.
AND SO NOW,
MY CHILDREN,
I PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE.
[CHEERING]...
...¡¡VIVA VILLA.
¡¡VIVA VILLA.
YOU REALLY GOTTA HAND IT
TO THAT FELLOW, THOUGH.
YES, SIR, YOU'’’VE REALLY
GOTTA HAND IT TO HIM.
HAND HIM WHAT?
PANCHO VILLA
IS A BANDIT, A BIGAMIST,
AND A BARBARIAN.
IT TAKES
MORE THAN DUMB LUCK
TO TURN THAT
INTO A NATIONAL HERO.
THE CHILI PICKER'’’S
GOT BRAINS.
I MAY HAVE STEPPED
INTO A MANURE PILE,
BUT I JUST MIGHT COME UP
WITH THE GOLDEN HORSESHOE.
ONE OF THESE DAYS, THAT MAN'’’S
GONNA OWN THIS COUNTRY.
HE DOESN'’’T WANT
TO OWN THE COUNTRY.
HE DOESN'’’T?
NO. HE WANTS
THE PEOPLE TO OWN IT.
AFTER ALL
YOU'’’VE BEEN THROUGH,
YOU STILL BELIEVE
THAT HE'’’S FOR THE PEOPLE?
N.
HE'’’S A GOOD MA
HOW '’’BOUT ME?
AM I A GOOD MAN, TOO?
YES.
WELL, I'’’LL TELL YOU
ONE THING, HONEY.
I'’’M AS GOOD A MAN AS VILLA,
AND THAT'’’S NOT SAYING
A HELL OF A LOT
FOR EITHER ONE OF US.
I DON'’’T CARE
WHAT YOU ARE.
Gen. Huerta: THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.
THIS IS AN OUTRAGE.
WHY?
TELL HIM
TO STAND UP.
STAND UP WHEN YOU
ADDRESS THE GENERAL,
DAMN YOU.
I AM GENERAL HUERTA
OF MADERO'’’S REPUBLICAN ARMY.
GET COLONEL VILLA.
WHO?
COLONEL FRANCISCO VILLA.
HE IS TO
TURN PARRAL OVER TO ME,
BY ORDER
OF PRESIDENT MADERO.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
NOW, WHERE IS VILLA?
GET HIM.
OHH.
HE'’’S NOT HERE.
I WILL FIND HIM
FOR YOU, THOUGH.
BUT I WARN YOU,
HE'’’S VERY HARD TO FIND
I WILL TRY.
COME ON.
YOU'’’RE TAKING ME TO MADERO.
WHAT?
HURRY UP.
GET YOUR PANTS ON.
HOW?
WELL, FIRST ONE LEG,
THEN THE OTHER.
WHERE IS MADERO?
MEXICO CITY.
MEXICO...
WHAT ABOUT
THE GASOLINE?
DON'’’T WORRY ABOUT
THE GASOLINE.
WHERE IS HE?
IN THE ANTEROOM,
MY PRESIDENT.
EXCUSE ME.
PANCHO, MY FRIEND,
CONGRATULATIONS.
WONDERFUL,
WONDERFUL.
HAVE YOU EATEN?
ARE YOU HUNGRY?
NO, THANK YOU,
MY PRESIDENT.
I'’’LL EAT LATER.
COME WITH ME.
WELL...WHAT IS IT?
T.
DON'’’T MAKE ME DO I
DO WHAT?
DON'’’T MAKE ME
GIVE PARRAL
TO GENERAL HUERTA.
PANCHO, THIS IS DANGEROUS.
WHAT IS DANGEROUS?
YOUR CONFLICT WITH HUERTA.
HOW COULD I HAVE
A CONFLICT WITH HIM?
I HAVEN'’’T EVEN
SEEN THE MAN.
NOR DID ANYONE ELSE
IN PARRAL,
UNTIL AFTER
I TOOK THE CITY.
THEN HE CAME.
CAME.
PANCHO, PLEASE DON'’’T
MISUNDERSTAND ME.
I'’’M HAPPY YOU'’’RE HERE,
VERY HAPPY, BUT...
YOU HAVE JUST CREATED
A TERRIBLE PROBLEM.
OH? YOU DON'’’T
WANT PARRAL?
OF COURSE I DO.
E,
BUT WHEN HUERTA FINDS OUT
THAT YOU'’’VE COME DIRECTLY TO M
HE WILL THINK THAT YOU AND I
ARE PLOTTING BEHIND HIS BACK...
AND THAT'’’S DANGEROUS.
WHO THE HELL
IS HUERTA, ANYWAY?
DID HE WIN PARRAL?
NO.
HE'’’S NO GOOD.
HE DRINKS.
HE'’’S NOT FOR YOU,
JUST FOR HIMSELF.
DON'’’T PUT ME
UNDER HIS COMMAND.
GENERAL HUERTA IS HEAD
OF THE REPUBLICAN ARMY.
WHAT ELSE COULD I DO?
I GAVE HIM MY WORD.
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR WORD TO ME?
DON'’’T YOU
OWE ME SOMETHING?
I TOOK PARRAL
FOR YOU, NOT HUERTA.
NO NATION
CAN HAVE 2 ARMIES.
UNDER HUERTA, ONE ARMY
IS ONE TOO MANY.
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU HAVE
AGAINST HUERTA?
I DON'’’T THINK
HE'’’S LOYAL TO YOU.
YOU PERSONALLY KNOW
THAT GENERAL HUERTA
PLANS TO OVERTHROW
THE REVOLUTION?
NO, MY PRESIDENT.
HAS ANYONE INDICATED TO YOU,
EVEN BY RUMOR,
THAT HE HAS SUCH PLANS?
NO, MY PRESIDENT.
THEN WHAT?
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.
SPEAK UP.
GET OUT OF HERE.
GET BACK TO YOUR PEOPLE.
FACTS.
I WANT FACTS.
GET OUT
OF THIS FANCY PALACE.
GIVE ME PROOF.
I CANNOT GIVE
YOU PROOF, BUT I KNOW.
I CAN SMELL IT. I KNOW.
PANCHO, DO YOU THINK THAT...
THAT I AM BETRAYING
THE REVOLUTION?
NO, BUT...
HOW CAN YOU TRUST HUERTA
AND NOT ME?
YOU'’’RE MY PRESIDENT.
I ASK YOU
ONLY ONE THING:
DON'’’T TRUST HIM.
EVERYONE IS
NOT LIKE YOU.
MY FRIEND, IT'’’S VERY MUCH
BETTER THAT I DIE A FOOL,
TRUSTING TOO MUCH,
THAN LIVE A TYRANT,
TRUSTING NO ONE AT ALL.
MEXICO'’’S HAD
ENOUGH OF THOSE.
OH, PANCHO, THIS IS
JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS.
ONCE AGAIN,
I'’’M ASKING FOR YOUR HELP.
IT'’’S ESSENTIAL TO ME
TO HAVE YOUR PROMISE
THAT YOU'’’LL OBEY
GENERAL HUERTA
AS YOU OBEY ME.
YOU'’’RE TOO GOOD.
THAT'’’S NEITHER
HERE NOR THERE.
HAVE I YOUR PROMISE?
YES, MY PRESIDENT.
I PROMISE.
AND SO, GENTLEMEN,
TOMORROW AT FIRST LIGHT,
WE WILL INITIATE
OUR ATTACK ON CONEJOS.
YOU, COLONEL VILLA,
WILL HAVE THE HONOR
OF LEADING YOUR FORCES
ON THE PRIMARY ASSAULT.
MAJOR EBANIAS WILL HOLD
THE RIGHT WING,
MAJOR ESCOBAR, THE LEFT.
AH, THIS IS THE LAST
COLORADO STRONGHOLD
IN THE NORTH,
AND I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND
I WILL NOT TOLERATE
ONE STEP BACKWARD.
HAS ANYONE EVER KNOWN ME
TO TAKE A STEP BACKWARD?
COLONEL VILLA, THERE ARE
OTHER OFFICERS IN THIS ROOM
BESIDES YOURSELF.
OR DON'’’T YOU THINK SO?
NOW, SINCE YOU'’’RE
LEADING THE ATTACK,
DON'’’T YOU
THINK IT ADVISABLE
TO GET UNDER WAY IMMEDIATELY,
COLONEL VILLA?
NO.
NO?
NO. IF I RIDE
IN DAYLIGHT,
THE DUST
WILL GIVE ME AWAY,
THE ENEMY WILL KNOW
I'’’M COMING.
I SHOULD RIDE
AT NIGHT.
MY DEAR COLONEL, YOU, UH...
YOU ARE LAYING SIEGE
TO THE TOWN...
NOT ROBBING IT.
YOU WILL LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.
GENTLEMEN,
I FULLY EXPECT
COLONEL VILLA'’’S FORCES
TO DO THEIR DUTY...
TO THE LAST MAN.
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?
FIRE.
CENTER, HO.
COME ON.
UHH.
AAH.
AAH.

BARBED WIRE.
LET'’’S GO.
GO? WHERE?
CAN'’’T YOU SEE?
VILLA'’’S GOING
TO BE OVERRUN.
OF COURSE HE IS.
THERE'’’S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.
LOOK AT THAT CITY.
IT'’’S SUICIDE
FLYING OVER THOSE GUNS.
YOU CAN SHOOT ME
IF YOU WANT TO.
I'’’M NOT GOING ANYPLACE.
NOT TILL WE GET SOME SUPPORT
FROM OUR OWN GUNS.
YOU WAIT HERE,
GRINGO, FOR ME.
[DISTANT GUNFIRE]
RETREAT. RETREAT.
COLORADOS ARE LINING UP
TO CHARGE.
WHY AREN'’’T YOU
FLYING WITH THE GRINGO?
HE TELLS ME IT'’’S SUICIDE,
UNLESS WE GET
ARTILLERY SUPPORT.
I THINK SO, TOO.
WHAT ARE THEY
WAITING FOR?
WHY DON'’’T THEY GIVE ME
ARTILLERY SUPPORT?
THAT STUPID
ARTILLERY OFFICER
SAYS THAT HE'’’S
GOT ORDERS
TO WAIT FOR YOU
TO COUNTERATTACK.
HUERTA.
HUERTA IS WAITING FOR ME
TO BE OVERRUN.
URBINA.
SPREAD YOUR MEN.

THE OUTER PERIMETER.
OUR MEN ARE REGROUPING
ALONG SECONDARY LINES
OF DEFENSE.
VILLA IN THE TRENCHES?
WELL...
FOR ONCE, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE FORCED THAT BANDIT
INTO OUR KIND OF WAR.
¡¡VIVA VILLA.
THROUGH THE WALL.
[BOOM]
WHERE IS THAT
COMING FROM?
I DON'’’T KNOW,
MY GENERAL.
[GUNFIRE]
UHH.

AAH.
Crowd, chanting: ¡¡VIVA VILLA.
¡¡VIVA VILLA.

I'’’M SORRY, MY GENERAL.
WE DID EVERYTHING
BUT SHOOT HIM OURSELVES.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
COME IN.
Villa: SOMETHING WRONG,
COLONEL FUENTES?
SPEAK UP.
GENERAL HUERTA WANTS
TO SEE YOU AT HIS QUARTERS
IMMEDIATELY, COLONEL VILLA.
ALL RIGHT.
AS SOON AS I'’’VE FINISH
ED MY SWEAT BATH.
THAT'’’S NOT SOON ENOUGH.
YOU MUST BE CRAZY.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
'THAT'’’S NOT SOON ENOUGH'?
YOU'’’RE UNDER ARREST,
COLONEL VILLA.
WE WANT TO SEND
A MESSAGE.
NO, NO.
GENERAL--
TO PRESIDENT
FRANCISCO MADERO...
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,
THE WORST SON OF A BITCH
IN YOUR ARMY
HAS JUST ARRESTED
PANCHO VILLA.
HE SAYS HE IS GOING
TO SHOOT HIM IN THE MORNING.
IF YOU DON'’’T DO SOMETHING
ABOUT CHANGING HUERTA'’’S MIND,
I WILL.
RESPECTFULLY...
MAJOR RODOLFO FIERRO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WRITING DOWN
THE MESSAGE, SIR.
YOU DON'’’T WASTE TI
ME WRITING.
JUST SEND IT
THE WAY I TOLD YOU.
YES, SIR.
YOU MAKE SURE
HE KEEPS SENDING.
YOU TELL VILLA
I SENT A MESSAGE TO MADERO,
BUT NOT TO COUNT ON MADERO,
ONLY ON US.
YOU TELL HIM
IF HE GIVES THE WORD,
WE WILL GET HIM OUT.
THE GIRL AND YOUR MONEY
WILL BE IN CHUPADERO.
WE WILL ALL MEET THERE.
I WANT TO SEE
THE GENERAL.
GENERAL, WHA--
UH... PARDON ME.
LOOK, GENERAL,
I LOSTMYAIRPLANE
INYOURWAR, AND ONE
OF YOUR OFFICERS
PROMISED TO PAY
FOR IT.
CLOSE THE DOOR.
WHICH OFFICER?
YOU KNOW VERY WELL
WHICHOFFICER--
COLONEL VILLA.
NOW, IF YOU DON'’’T MIND , I'’’D LIKE TO SEE HIM
AND GET THIS MATTER
TAKEN CARE OF.
AH, YES.
AH, YES. YES.
AH, VERY WELL,
MR. ARNOLD.
BUT YOU NEGLECT
TO MENTION ONE THING.
IT SEEMS THE AIRPLANE
WASN'’’T YOURS TO BEGIN WITH.
COGNAC, MR. ARNOLD?
I BELIEVE I WILL, YES.
ORDERLY, A COGNAC
FOR MR. ARNOLD.
NOW, TOMORROW MORNING
YOU'’’LL BE PROVIDED
WITH A MILITARY ESCORT
TO THE AMERICAN CONSULATE
IN LAREDO.
FROM THERE, THEY WILL
CONDUCT YOU BACK TO EL PASO,
WHERE YOU WILL ANSWER TO CHARGES
OF GRAND THEFT, AMONG OTHERS.
TO YOUR HEALTH,
MR. ARNOLD.
I, UH--I DON'’’T SUPPOSE
THERE'’’S ANYTHING I CAN
SAY THAT MIGHT, UH...
I'’’M AFRAID NOT.
I'’’M DOUBLY SORRY,
MR. ARNOLD. I ASSURE YOU,
WE APPRECIATE ALL YOU
HAVE DONE FOR THE REVOLUTION,
BUT YOU MUST ALSO APPRECIATE
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
THAT I, UH...
OR MY GOVERNMENT, THAT IS,
MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS
WITH THE UNITED STATES.
YOU CAN SEE THAT,
CAN'’’T YOU?
OH, YES, I CAN SEE THAT.
GOOD.
YOU'’’RE UNDER ARREST.
HEY, GRINGO...
THAT'’’S ME.
LEARNING PRETTY FAST...
PRETTY FAST.
YEAH,
YOU'’’RE ALL RIGHT.
YOU'’’LL BE ABLE
TO WRITE YOUR WILL
BEFORE THEY
SHOOT YOUR TAIL
ALL OVER
THAT PARADE GROUND.
YOU'’’VE GOT TO KNOW
SOMETHING I DON'’’T.
ANSWER ME.
YOU MADE A DEAL
WITH HUERTA, HUH?
HE WON'’’T LET IT HAPPEN.
OH, HE WON'’’T?
HOW?
HE WON'’’T.
[SIGHS] CHIEF...
MADERO IS A LONG WAY
FROM HERE.
Y.
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
HE'’’S IN MEXICO CIT
NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU
AND MR. MADERO
ARE THE BEST
OF FRIENDS,
NOBODY HAS ANY MORE
RESPECT FOR THE MAN
THAN I DO, BUT,
UH, IT WOULDN'’’T
BE THE FIRST TIME
IN THIS REVOLUTION
THAT SOMEBODY FORGOT
TO PROTECT A FRIEND,
NOW, WOULD IT?
GRINGO, YOU'’’RE DUMB.
ALL RIGHT.
I MAY BE.
BUT YOU THINK ABOUT
WHAT I JUST SAID, HUH?
[SIGHS]
MADERO WON'’’T PROTECT ME
JUST BECAUSE HE'’’S A FRIEND.
NO?
OF COURSE NOT.
NOW, TO BE SHOT,
I HAVE TO BE SENTENCED.
TO BE SENTENCED,
I HAVE TO BE TRIED.
TO BE TRIED,
I HAVE TO BE ACCUSED
OF HAVING DONE
SOMETHING WRONG.
NOW, ALL THIS
TAKES A LONG TIME.
BESIDES, I HAVEN'’’T
DONE ANYTHING WRONG.
BUT EVEN IF I HAD,
MADERO WOULD PROTECT ME,
BECAUSE HE WOULDN'’’T WANT A MAN
TO BE DEPRIVED OF HIS RIGHTS.
HE WON'’’T STAND FOR INJUSTICE,
SO HUERTA CANNOT
SHOOT ME TOMORROW.
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.
D.
I UNDERSTAND
YOU'’’RE OUT OF YOUR MIN
CHIEF...
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS TO GET THE WORD
TO YOUR MEN,
AND THEY'’’LL HAVE Y
OU OUTTA HERE.
IT'’’S THAT SIMPLE.
IT'’’S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
WELL, YOU CAN'’’T FIGHT
FOR THE REVOLUTION
IF YOU'’’RE DEAD.
I'’’M FIGHTING FOR IT
RIGHT NOW, HERE.
THIS IS UNJUST,
TO DEPRIVE ME OF MY LIBERTY.
YOUR LIBERTY?
WHAT'’’S THAT?
'LIBERTY IS THE RESPECT
FOR THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS.'
THAT IS WHAT
BENITO JUAREZ SAID.
THAT IS WHAT MADERO
BELIEVES IN.
THAT'’’S WHAT WE'’’VE
BEEN FIGHTING FOR.
NOW, IF I WALK OUT OF HERE
WITHOUT A TRIAL,
I DENY THAT
AND BEHAVE LIKE A BANDIT.
WELL, JUST WHEN HAVE YOU
STOPPED BEING A BANDIT?
WHAT ABOUT
THAT LITTLE CAPER
UP IN CONEJOS
THE OTHER DAY?
THOSE MEN WERE TRAITORS,
AND HUERTA KNOWS IT VERY WELL--
THERE'’’S NO POINT
IN TALKING ABOUT IT.
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME,
CHIEF?
HOW '’’BOUT ME?
I'’’M ONE OF YOUR MEN,
TOO, RIGHT?
SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO YOU,
THEY MAY
AS WELL SHOOT ME.
I'’’M DEPRIVED OF 20 YEA
RS OF MY LIBERTY.
I'’’VE GOT NOTHING.
I'’’VE GOT NO--NO PLANE,
NO MONEY.
I WIND UP WITH NOTHING.
GRINGO...
YOU NEVER
DID HAVE ANYTHING.
YOU HAVE LIVED
JUST FOR YOURSELF,
NOT FOR A CAUSE,
NOT EVEN FOR A WOMAN.
WHY, YOU HYPOCRITICAL,
FATHEADED GREASEBALL,
DON'’’T YOU
TELL ME WHO I AM.
UNH.
WHAT IS IT, COLONEL?

MY COLONEL, YOUR MEN,
THEY'’’VE BEEN SENT
TO OTHER UNITS,
AND SOME
OF YOUR OFFICERS,
THEY ARE UNDER
TEMPORARY ARREST.
MAJOR FIERRO
IS WANTED FOR MURDER.
BELIEVE ME...
IT WASN'’’T MY IDEA,
MY CHIEF.
Gen. Huerta: COLONEL FUENTES?
YES, MY GENERAL?
COLONEL VILLA
COMMANDS NOTHING NOW,
CERTAINLY
NOT YOUR FIRING SQUAD.
CARRY OUT MY ORDERS.
BUT WHY?
YOU HAVE TO
TELL ME WHY.

Col. Fuentes: READY...

IF YOU ARE

EVEN IF I HAVE TO
CHOKE IT OUT OF YOU.
STOP HIM,
OR YOU'’’LL ALL BE SHOT.
THIS IS WRONG.
YOU KNOW THIS IS WRONG.
MADERO SENT WORD.
WHO SAID?
I DO.
COLONEL VILLA,
ARE YOU GOING TO STAND
AND TAKE YOUR EXECUTION
LIKE A MEXICAN,
OR SHALL I HAVE YOU SHOT
ON THE GROUND?
HEY, BOY.

I'’’M TAKING IT ALL.
WELL, I CAN'’’T JUST STAND HERE
AND COUNT IT, CAN I?

HEY, LEE.

COLLAR DADDY BOUGHT ME.
AND I WAS SO WORRIED
ABOUT FINDING EXACTLY
THE RIGHT THING,
WELL, IN EL PASO,
ESPECIALLY,
BUT THEN
I SAW THIS GOWN.
IT WAS IN A LITTLE SHOP
RIGHT CATTY-CORNER
FROM THE HOTEL,

OH, IT'’’S MARVELOUS.
T,
IT'’’S PITCH-BLACK VELVE
YARDS AND YARDS OF IT,
AND THE BODICE IS ALL
STUDDED WITH GARNETS,
AND, OH, I JUST LOVE IT.
IT FEELS SO...
SO SENSUOUS.
DON'’’T YOU
JUST LOVE VELVET?
VERY MUCH.
OF COURSE,
IT WAS OUTRAGEOUSLY
EXPENSIVE,
BUT I JUST
HAD TO BUY IT. ANYWAY,
DADDY SAYS THERE'’’S GON
NA BE A WAR IN EUROPE SOON,
AND THE PRICE OF BEEF
WILL GO UP,
AND SO WE'’’LL

HEY, DARLIN'’’...

THEY'’’RE ANNOYING ME.
HMM?

OH, UH,

HELLO, CHIEF.
Urbina: HELLO, GRINGO.
HOW ARE YA?

I DON'’’T THINK SO.
WE'’’RE GETTING READY

WE'’’D LIKE YOU
TO COME WITH US.
AND DO WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
'DO WHAT'?
TAKE IT.
GET RID OF HUERTA.
YOU SEE, WE THOUGHT...
WITH OUR MONEY THAT YOU'’’VE
BEEN KEEPING FOR US,
WE WILL BUY GUNS.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE,
CHIEF.
WAIT A MINUTE.
IT'’’S ALL OVER.
CAN'’’T YOU SEE THAT?
THE REVOLUTION
IS FINISHED.
YOU GAVE IT
YOUR BEST SHOT, CHIEF,
BUT AFTER ALL, HUERTA'’’
S SITTING IN THAT PALACE,
AND MADERO IS DEAD,
AND THERE'’’S NO WAY
IN THE WORLD
YOU THREE ARE GONNA
CHANGE THAT. NO WAY.
WE WOULD LIKE OUR MONEY,
GRINGO.
[SHOUTING] I WOULDN'’’T
GIVE YOU A D--
I WOULDN'’’T GIVE YOU
A DIME.
WHAT FOR?
TO GO DOWN THERE AND SHOOT
UP A LOT OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE
JUST SO SOME OTHER DICTATOR
CAN CALL HIMSELF PRESIDENT?
MADERO WAS NO DICTATOR.
PANCHO...
DON'’’T ARGUE
WITH HIM.
SHOOT HIM,
AND LET'’’S GO.
NO.
NO. WE DON'’’T
DO THAT ANYMORE.
WELL...
GOOD-BYE, GRINGO.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE,
CHIEF.
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO?
FIRST...
TAKE MEXICO CITY,
THEN FIND
ANOTHER MADERO.
WELL,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT I HAVE NEVER
BEEN SO HUMILIATED
IN ALL MY LIFE.
TO LEAVE ME HERE,
SITTING ALONE,
AND IN FRONT
OF ALL EL PASO.
MARSHA, DO ME A FAVOR,
WILL YA?
JUST SHUT UP.
[GASPS]
MAY I HAVE THE CHECK,
PLEASE?
I'’’D LIKE TO WRITE YOU
A RECEIPT, UH...
MR. ELLMORE.
HOW MUCH
FOR THE HORSES?
UH...YOU GO AHEAD
AND BE MY GUESTS.
GET ON THOSE HORSES AND GO.
NO. WE PAY.
WHEN I GET
TO MEXICO CITY,
I'’’LL SEND YOU
THE MONEY.
HOW MUCH?
WELL, IF THAT'’’S THE WAY
YOU FEEL ABOUT IT,
HOW ABOUT $35 FOR ALL
OF '’’EM, EVERYTHING,
THE WHOLE KIT AND CABOODLE?
NOT ENOUGH.
35 EACH.
YOU'’’LL BE HEARING
FROM ME.
PANCHO VILLA.
[WHISTLING A TUNE]...
...[AIRPLANE APPROACHES]
HA HA.
YEE HA.
Hey!
The sheriff ain't in.
Come back tomorrow.
You say something?
I only said the sheriff ain't in.
Well, where would we be lucky enough to find him?
Fishing.
He'll be back tomorrow for the hanging.
If I can help...
Why not.
You could tell us something.
Sure. What?
Some time ago, there was a reward out for Bill San Antonio.
Five thousand, I believe.
I can check up.
It will only take a little while.
- I'll be...
- Take my word for it.
Here's all that's left of him.
Enough for the reward.
Our old friend died with his boots off.
No, I'm sorry. We need sure proof.
Unfortunately, I can't supply you with "sure proof", as you call it.
He got blown up.
Come on, Hutch.
Let's not waste any more time.
Hey! What shall I do with these?
Play with them in your free time. Ha!
What can I do for you?
Take three or four men and have them carry in the case that's on that wagon.
And tell your friend to keep his eyes peeled.
There's 300,000 in there.
Dollars?
As good as.
It's gold.
Same as got robbed from a train on the MK&T a month ago, and which we were lucky enough to pick up.
- Really, sir, I...
- Just one more thing.
Where can we find the owner of this piggy bank?
Mr. Harold's office is upstairs, but the president isn't scheduled to see anyone today,
Mr... I'm sorry,
I didn't catch your name, and unless I know that, I...
I never told you. Come on, Hutch.
Hey, you two.
If Mr. Pick says the president won't see you, it means you ain't going anywhere, understand?
Get a move on.
Let's get that case out there unloaded now, buttercup.
There's no use in running risks.
My good man, I think you better announce us... to your boss.
But weren't you told that Mr. Harold receives callers only by appointment?
He'll receive us. You'll see.
Just say it's San Antonio who wants to talk to him.
You could be our Lord in person, it would be the same thing.
Don't forget, huh?
Tell him, "Bill San Antonio".
If he sees us, it means he and Bill were in cahoots.
Because a bandit that steals a bank's gold from the train is likely to be the last person in the world to know the president of that bank.
So if Bill was telling the truth, and he kept swearing he was, then half the gold he robbed in the past few years finished in the pockets of that gentleman, right?
That's why he won't see us.
All we have to do is look at him to understand it's impossible a man like him could have got mixed up with that son of a bitch.
Oh, may he rest in peace.
Let's get out of here, Cat.
We might as well wait.
If I'm right...
...I'll make him spit up all the loose change.
There's enough of that for both of us to retire on.
Come in, gentlemen, please.
You think we overdid it?
No.
A small personal gift from Mr. Harold.
How should I put it?
A little memento of his appreciation for what we've done for him.
In gold, mister.
Get it ready. We'll be by in a couple of hours.
You're gonna need a little time.
Gold, huh?
- How does it feel to be rich?
- I don't know.
I'm not used to it yet. Hey, watch it.
A quarter of a dollar and few minutes' patience, and you'll have a picture of yourself just as you are now that will last centuries.
Take advantage now.
Tomorrow could be too late.
Hold still, please.
- Hold still, please!
- You know,
- I never had my picture taken.
- One, two,
- Now's a good a time as any.
- three, four, five,
- No.
- six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twe...
No, no, no, no, no. Now, a little more to the left. No.
Now. Now. This way. Here you are.
Now, good, now. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
No, no, no. Now, don't move.
Now, that's right.
This way, you won't get tired.
Yeah, lean on it. That's it. There.
See how simple it is? Magnificent.
A stupendous sight, but I know what's missing.
Just a minute. It costs only a few cents more, but wait till you see the effect.
Now, perfect.
Hold still now, please.
Just a matter of seconds.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...
Looking at you, I don't know which one is the pigeon.
...nine, ten, eleven.
You moved!
Oh, my dove!
The man shot my dove!
That's the only one I have!
Forget it.
Now, why don't you get smart.
Why should I?
He ain't fooling around.
Because I say so!
Hey, you!
Come on.
Come on. Hold him down.
The suits they make nowadays, they sure aren't worth a damn.
I've had enough fun.
Let's go get our money at the bank.
Get ourselves out of this lousy village.
- That's it.
- Little more.
Look at that, would you?
Take the rope.
They sure got nasty folks around here.
They hang people too.
I'll repeat it for the last time.
Yes or no?
I want an immediate answer.
All right. So you're not interested.
Do you or don't you want to understand
I'm giving you an opportunity to save your neck from that damned rope?
When I give my word, I keep it.
I said tonight, and tonight someone will get you out of here.
You'll have to take care of the rest.
But if I know you, you'll find a way to recover the money those sons of bitches stole from me.
I lost a partner recently.
If you're interested, you can take his place.
We were friends once.
We can be again.
It's up to you, and you know it.
- All you have to do is just...
- Where can I find them?
As far as I know, they're still in town.
They're in no hurry.
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, fella.
- It's gonna rain soon. We need it.
- Yeah, we need it.
Come inside.
I got something to tell you.
Well, why don't you boys just sit down and have a drink.
I just had a bottle delivered to me that'll really...
Get moving. Sooner we get out of here, the better it is.
Come on, hurry!
I said, hurry up!
You, huh?
I wonder if it works.
Come on.
Let's go.
It works.
Pretty, isn't it?
It's like the life of a man, beautiful while it lasts.
- I told you this afternoon...
- You told me too much.
In my opinion, you're getting old.
Once, you used to count your words.
But this afternoon, you told me so much...
...I almost forgot to ask about our mutual friends.
Our friends?
Still not thinking of that old story, are you?
No. Simple curiosity.
You know...
...15 years of hard labor sort of cuts into your social life.
What are they doing now?
Where are they, around here?
No. Paco went back to Mexico.
Years ago.
Years ago?
And Drake? What about Drake?
He settled in Fair City, near Memphis, went into business.
- Big business, huh?
- Yes. He's gone up in the world.
But as far as you're concerned, you don't need them.
- I'm here to help you any way I...
- I know, I know.
You're here to help me make up for the lost time.
You told me. You told me.
- You like them?
- What?
Classy, huh?
And comfortable too.
If it weren't for these, I would've made a mistake tonight.
I would not have noticed... this.
Instead, what do you know?
My eyes fell on this just as I was putting my boots on.
You know, it's bad taking too many precautions.
That's better.
You know...
...the idea of killing a deputy with my knife wouldn't have come from the kind of people you sent, but from a more refined mind.
I no sooner finish those 15 years when I'm beaten up in a saloon and robbed of my knife.
And while I'm asleep, that knife winds up in somebody's chest.
Somebody I don't even know.
But that little detail, the law overlooks.
And before I know it,
I'm behind bars again.
Those two you sort of hinted you wanted taken care of, they must have given you a rough time...
...if, after you get a rope around my neck without dirtying your hands, you suddenly change your filthy mind, all in the name of old friendship, you say.
Actually, it's because those two sort of took the shine off your image.
And you had no one on hand quick enough to restore it by finishing them off.
Isn't that it, partner?
You keep on the side of the law.
But me, with a jailbreaking charge and the departed soul of a deputy hanging over my head...
"Easy to handle", you must have thought.
You're out of your mind.
Out of my mind?
Prove it to me.
Prove to me you won't double-cross me the way you did 15 years ago.
Or the way you did just one month ago.
Do I make myself clear, partner?
This time, I want proof.
Concrete proof.
What proof?
Yeah... what?
There, that's proof enough for me.
Buy myself a nice little farm...
...few head of cattle. Not many.
I'll have enough income left to live on for a hundred years.
Income.
Got any idea what income is?
You put the money in the bank, and every month, the bank pays you interest.
You go to sleep...
...and meanwhile, the interest is growing.
You go fishing, and the interest increases.
And your capital stays untouched.
You sleeping?
You'd keep quiet, maybe I could.
Takes a smart man to understand you.
You put your hands on a mountain of money...
...no strings attached...
...and for you, it's the most natural thing in the world, and you sleep.
Just sleep.
Hi.
Hello, friends!
There's a rumor you just cleaned out a bank.
It so happens I had savings in that bank.
Never mind the jokes.
Oh, don't take it so badly.
You're both young and strong.
Me, I have to make up for so much wasted time.
There are many things
I have to attend to.
So don't worry.
I just need a small amount.
Just enough for the bare necessities.
Well, no.
Money corrupts Man. It softens him.
So to keep you young and pure,
I think I'll take everything.
You'll thank me for this someday.
Listen, before you go, there's one thing I'd do if I were you.
What is that?
Shoot me.
What a nice idea.
The world is too small for you to get far enough away from me.
I'll find you sooner or later.
Listen, tiny, you must have worms in your brain.
Cacapoulos doesn't go around shooting people just to have something to do.
Then give me a loaded gun.
Oh, no, I can't do that.
My grandfather always used to say,
"Even if you have a small advantage, be careful not to lose it.
"In the best of circumstances, you'd be considered a fool."
And I always find myself in trouble if I don't follow my grandfather's advice.
So long, friends!
Shoot me.
You shoot me.
A peasant.
You see? A peasant on a dirty donkey.
And a minute later, you're lying ass up on the ground, without having the time to say, "ouch".
We let ourselves be fooled like amateurs.
My farm.
My interest sitting in the bank.
Shoot me, Cat!
Come on, shoot me!
What are you waiting for?
Shoot me. Shoot me...!
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
You gone loco?
Put down the gun, Cat.
And you save your breath.
We have 30 miles to do before we see a living soul.
Stay here. They need water and food, I'd say.
The murrain falls on us.
And before Jim and I can make out what's going on, all the bulls and cows are in pastures with their legs straight up like pegs.
And we're left with just about nothing.
Well, we were worse off than when me and my old lady came here 30 years ago.
Worse off, indeed.
Without a penny for a blind man's song.
That's how it was.
I was just thinking of finishing myself off,
- when guess what happens.
- What happened?
A miracle, that's what happened.
- Guess who appears in front of me.
- Who appeared in front of you?
Our savior.
Oh, well, it didn't look like him.
He gets off his horse, and he says to me,
"Hey, old man.
"You look worse than an undertaker without a job."
So while he's eating, because he looked hungrier than you did,
I tell him all my troubles.
Of course, I'm just letting off steam, and he don't even seem to be listening to me, when all of sudden, he comes out with a big laugh, and he says,
"Is 5,000 enough?"
And I says, "What?"
And then he says,
"Write out a receipt.
"I have an idea that you're going to get a loan from Cacapoulos."
Pa wanted him to stay, but Mr. Cacapoulos is a man who likes to see happy people around him.
So he left with a strange man who earns his living walking on a rope a hundred feet above the ground, and he went into town with his wagon for the fair.
If we don't hurry, that crook won't have a cent left.
Nice to give to charity when it's other people's money.
Quiet, please. This is very dangerous.
Thank you.
Quiet, please.
Step right over this way...
Step right up here.
Well, how about this?
What's the matter with you?
Why, you little bitch. Come here.
Get your hands off me! Please! Help!
Don't! Please let go!
Skip it.
He needs a dozen like you before he even starts having fun.
Even if you're an idiot, I don't see why you wanna die so young.
I'll join you if you don't mind.
All right. If somebody's ready to start.
I warned you.
He left last night.
Told us he was going all the way to Tula on the other side of the border.
He said he had an old account to settle.
Did he...?
Did he give you a loan too?
To tell you the truth, he offered me one.
But I refused.
We've always been able to make it on our own, at least until today.
You'd have done all right today too.
You certainly didn't need us to handle those guys.
Thank you. You're very kind.
Mr. Cacapoulos, too, is very kind.
He seems to wanna make everybody happy.
And that's very nice of him.
Except, it seems to me, it's very hard to make everybody happy.
It seems to me that
Mr. Cacapoulos is not very thrifty.
Well...
...I think it's about time we got going.
Looks like this is it.
You like to bet?
- This fiesta, we're paying for it.
- You can count on it.
- He dead, that one there?
- "No entiendo, señor".
Este hombre, ¿ está muerto?
¿ El nuestro benefactor, muerto?
No, "señor". No, not dead.
Is... He's good to us. Not dead.
No", señor".
If I could get my fingers around his neck...
Listen, Miguel, I wanna play a joke on those two gringos over there.
See them?
"Bienvenidos" to Tula, "señores".
Take it easy. This stuff will knock you right out if you're not careful.
Not me.
The hell with it. It's me that's paying.
Now, then. Piece of paper, huh?
You ugly little cockroach,
I'm gonna kill you!
We can't talk in here.
Let's go outside. I can't hear you.
We got nothing to say to each other.
Just spit out my money, and fast.
And if I don't?
I wouldn't be carrying it with me anyway.
It's no use looking for Cat.
By now, he's about ten miles from here thinking he'll find me.
What do you mean?
Follow me.
You know, tiny, in your condition,
I could lay you out flat.
Very quickly, without any trouble.
Why don't you try.
During my travels, I was thinking.
I decided to give you back your money.
All of it. I don't need it anymore.
Sure, you done nothing else but spread it around.
Small change.
And anyway, I'll give you back even that.
There's somebody here who owes me a big debt.
To have debts owed you is one thing.
To collect them is another.
He'll pay.
All I want is you two to leave me alone till I get it.
And then I'll give it back to you, seeing as you care so much about it.
It seems money is nothing to you,
I guess.
You're wrong.
Once, I was convinced there was something more important. I...
Try to imagine that you have three friends...
...that you've shared everything with them since you were a boy.
Even these.
Imagine, one day you clean out a bank...
...and while you get away...
...half the town on your heels...
...one of your good friends pulls out a gun and shoots your horse out from under you.
And then they shout,
"You hold them off till we catch our breath.
"Then we'll come back and free you."
Fifteen years I waited for them.
Doing hard labor.
And the best part is, they didn't forget.
Oh, no.
They were waiting till I got out so they could send me straight to hell.
Lower me gently into a nice new grave.
And put a stone on my head.
But these friends of yours...
...how many did you say there are?
Two.
There were three.
I took care of the first.
And the second?
Paco?
It's his turn tomorrow.
I don't like to look on the dark side...
...but suppose, instead of your friend
Paco, it's you who gets shot?
Would you explain to me why I have to go through hell just to get back what's mine?
You don't trust me?
I have another idea.
What?
If you want, you can come with me.
Sure, sure.
Why not? The two of us together.
Be easy as child's play.
Well, now, that's a wonderful idea.
¡Fuego!
Preparados, apunten, ¡fuego!
Preparados.
Apunten.
¡Fuego!
Another one. Enrique Ramirez
Sanchez Cornejo y Mendoza.
The charge?
He refused the opportunity to fight for the liberty and independence of our great country.
For the defense.
A pig.
The jury?
Rebel.
Rebel.
He's a rebel.
Guilty.
Another one.
Ramirez Fernandez Sanchez
Eugenio y Mendoza.
Take your hat off!
Like you said, huh?
It's gonna be child's play.
Leave it to me.
¡Cargáis!
¡Preparados!
- "Leave it to me", huh?
- Buddy, I didn't force you to come.
¡Apunten!
¡Fuego!
Those are my friends from Tula.
I underestimated them.
You see, some friends are better than others.
I wouldn't be so sure if I were you.
Open the gate! Open the gate!
"¡Nombre de Dios!" The gate!
Take care of that damn machine gun!
How did you manage to get all these people together?
I just told them Cacapoulos had a lot of money hidden somewhere.
Look how they're guarding his life.
Now drive the rebels out!
Through the gate, men!
Through the gate!
Come on, men! Follow me!
Follow me!
¡ Viva la Revolución!
Cover him!
Cover him, "nombre de Dios", cover hi...!
Where the hell is he going?
All right, come on.
Jump!
Wait, wait!
Onward, "mis hombres", on!
Here we are, just the two of us.
All alone.
I spit on your mother.
Not for long.
Wait, wait!
Did you make him...
...give back the money?
I forgot.
Don Pedro Ramirez Maria
Santiago Gutierrez.
Charge?
He wanted to fight for the freedom of our country.
Guilty!
- Another one.
- Jimenez Maria Ortega y Manolo del Fraile.
From what I can see now, we have to share with all these people, huh?
Nice idea you had.
Yeah, now that you mention it, it would have been better if I'd never had it.
At least I'd be free of two imbeciles.
If only this imbecile would make up his mind to talk.
He'll talk.
Let them finish their patriotic duties, and you'll see.
Cangaciero doesn't have the tender heart you have...
...you ox.
No! No! No!
I wouldn't like to be in your shoes.
Look at the mess you put us in.
Idiot!
You and your fantasies.
You're out of your head.
Don't think I'll lift a finger when they separate it from your neck!
"You'll get it all back, even the pennies.
"There's somebody around here that owes me a big debt."
Then...
...when he gets that swindler in his hands...
...he kills him without even giving him the time to sign a piece of paper!
Coffee's boiling.
I'd like a cup.
Did you hear that?
Mr. Cacapoulos wants coffee.
And how would you like it?
With sugar or without?
Without.
Well, this time, Mr. Cacapoulos will have to make an exception.
Open your mouth.
What's the matter, too hot?
Cacapoulos.
What kind of a name is that?
A Greek name.
My grandfather was a Greek.
He was a Greek.
Like Sophocles, Aristophanes,
Plato, Homer.
And like Ulysses, he had to keep traveling.
He never suffered from homesickness, my grandfather.
Oh, no.
And so...
...he left the schooner on which he had embarked and continued his travels on foot.
Bouncing from place to place, trading in skins, until he came to a Cherokee tribe.
And there, he was admired by an Indian girl.
Or he admired her,
I don't know which.
But the fact is, among other children...
...my father, too, was born.
And he grew up and raised a family in a small mining town.
And he had just the time to do it...
...when someone shot him dead.
And my grandfather, told of it...
...had to get his son's body...
...and he had to take me too, still teething...
...back to his tribe.
And I cried...
...and I cried...
...and I cried.
Who cried?
He had some very strange ideas, my grandfather.
What ideas?
"I advise you," he said,
"never tell lies.
"It means you fear those facing you.
"On the other hand, never tell the truth either.
"In the best of cases, they'll put you on a cross,
"like they did someone centuries ago."
That's what'll happen to you if you don't cut it short.
He wasn't such a fool, your grandpa.
I'd like to know what his advice would have been tonight.
"If you have a loaf of bread," he would've told me,
"no matter how large...
"...don't cut it into thin slices,
"or else you'll wind up with an empty stomach."
Yes, he was really a wise old man, your grandpa.
Then it's agreed.
Yes.
Quick, untie him. We'll have to borrow three horses.
Hey.
You try anything funny, and...
What?
This way, "mis hombres"!
Don't shoot!
My grandfather used to say,
"One ally's not enough.
"Two is too many."
Try not to get yourselves killed, my friends.
I would be very sorry!
He already told me that damn story.
Giddap.
Bienvenidos.
Mr. Cacapoulos knew you'd make out all right.
He left me the job of burying three of them.
This one is the last.
He says he hasn't finished yet.
He still has one to kill.
He's very, very sorry.
He says, "Don't worry."
He says, "Thanks for all you done."
He says, "Hello, folks."
Watch it, pal.
One more.
Watch it.
No, he's gonna make it.
I know he is.
Hurry up, you hear? I'm hungry.
Hey, have a look.
Haven't I seen that other one somewhere before too?
Yeah, on top of a rope.
What...? What the...?
Hey.
Hello, friends.
Sure took you a long time.
Where?
Wait a minute. Calm down.
Where?
This is no time to lose your temper.
Where?
- Now, you don't wanna get mad.
- Where is it?
- Now, wait. Now, we'll talk in minute.
- Where?!
There.
What's that? A bank, maybe?
Safer. A gambling house.
You mean...?
You mean to say...?
I mean... I mean... I mean to say...
Yes. I lost it. AII. Every penny of it.
- But you don't have to worry.
- I think I'll kill him.
- Will you listen to me, huh?
- Yeah, I'll kill him.
- It won't help.
- Even so, I'm gonna kill you.
- If you listen to me, I...
- Take it easy, Hutch.
- Take it easy.
- Sure.
If you'll listen to me,
I have something to tell you.
Oh, you mad killer!
I didn't do it.
You know, gambling is a terrible vice.
What are you doing in a kitchen?
Earning money to eat with.
In Fair City, people with money only think about gambling.
That's all they're interested in.
My act was going great till they started having fun betting whether I'd fall or not.
Are you ready to listen to me now?
We're all ears.
Drink up, shorty.
It's not as bitter a pill as you think.
So I traveled for a time, here and there, until I find where the third friend is.
You and your damn lies.
You came here straight as an arrow.
And leave your grandfather and his darned advice out of it.
All right. All right.
I knew where Drake was, and I came here straight as an arrow.
- But he's a hard nut to crack.
- Here we go again, huh?
Just let him talk.
So I couldn't settle the question right away.
I begin snooping around, and I end up at the casino.
And that, too, belongs to my old friend.
So as not to attract attention,
I place a few bets.
I like it.
And when I really start enjoying myself...
You went and got cleaned out.
From what I've heard around, those people play rough.
Mr. Cacapoulos got cleaned out before he realized it.
He sure had a lot of money to start with.
There's something very strange going on in that shack.
Washing dishes brings ideas.
And sure enough, I get one.
And that's why I was waiting for you.
Listen to that. He was even impatient.
Out with the idea.
Put 50 on the red...
- Fifty on 12.
- All right, gentlemen.
Last call. This is last call, gentlemen.
I know a lot people...
Please.
Checkroom's over there.
How much money do you have?
- Change it.
- And if I lose?
Be careful.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Please place your bets.
All bets down. No more bets, please.
Eight. The gentleman's number is eight.
Six. Try again, sir.
All side bets down. Going for eight.
Thirty-four red. Fair pass.
My friend, I'll make you rich tonight.
I'm on a lucky streak.
But... Hey.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Please place your bets.
All bets are down.
No more bets, please.
No more bets.
Twenty-six black. Fair pass.
Get it in there again, Tommy.
- Hit him!
- Come on.
My grandfather used to say, "There's only one way to make money."
Forget it. Forget it.
Try to get in there, Tommy.
- Step right in there.
- Knock him back, Bill.
Come on, now! Come on, boy!
- Get in there, boy.
- Come on, now.
Do you think this is the moment to waste time around here?
- Come on!
- Let's go!
Go on, ring the gong.
Sorry, gents. Sorry.
Twenty-five dollars,
I say, 25 dollars to anyone able to knock out this great champion from Mississippi,
Tommy Glancing Blow, in a regular boxing match, the new sport so popular in England today.
Come on, boys. I can't believe you haven't got the guts. Well?
My offer not enough?
OK, I'll double it.
Fifty dollars. Fifty dollars, boys.
I'm not fooling you.
I'm talking 50 big dollars.
- Let's see it.
- Certainly, sir. By all means.
The gentleman is of little faith.
And he is in his rights to check.
Our motto is "faith and trust", my dear sir, since faith is the soul of commerce.
Thus, we don't want to see your 5 dollars until the end of the match, in the unhappy event you lose.
Step right up, sir.
Not me.
Him.
What's going on?
- Show it.
- He's gonna show it.
Silence, folks, a little silence.
And let's free the ring.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you the heavyweight champion from Missouri,
Hutch Bessy, in a fight to the finish under the
Marquis of Queensbury rules.
Come on, Hutch.
We're depending on you.
Go on! Go on!
Now throw the punch, Hutch!
Don't forget the 50!
Come on, Hutch!
You know you can do it. Come on!
You know you can do it! Come on!
Watch him! Watch him!
- Watch him. Watch him.
- Hutch!
- Don't turn your head!
- Hit him! Hit him! Hit him!
Keep your head low.
Come on!
Yeah! That's the way to do it there!
- Go on, muscles!
- Come on.
- Go on, now!
- Come on. Back in there!
Come on, Hutch! You won't miss!
Hit him! Hit him!
Stop! You gotta stop!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
- Hit him again.
- Hit him again.
- Hit him!
- Get him!
Attaboy, Hutch! OK.
He's scared of you. He's scared of you.
He's scared of you.
Come on! Hit him! Hit him!
Come on! Get in there!
Come on! Go!
- Hit him, Tommy!
- What do you mean, hit him?
- My man's gonna knock him flat!
- He's got him now.
Get him now! Get him now!
- Finish him! Finish him!
- Finish him off!
Get him! Come on!
Come on! Finish him!
Come on, Hutch!
Get him now! Come on!
Come on! Hit him! Hit him!
Come on, Hutch!
Come on! Left, right, left, right!
Get in there, boy. Come on.
Hutch won! Hey!
That was it! Goodbye!
- And what's this?
- A people-leveler, sir.
What?
When it goes off, it's better to be the one directly behind it.
- What do you mean?
- Oh, this sprays bullets.
The sheriff says you can't tie a rope on the roof of the gambling house.
If he'd given me the right permit, we wouldn't be needing this.
Do you still feel like it?
This is no joke.
- Save your breath.
- All right.
So she was saying,
"Get out of my house.
"I never wanna see you again..."
"A wife should stay in her place
"instead of criticizing everything her husband does."
You think she understood that?
Hell, no.
Can't blame a man for going out nights, playing cards and drinking a little.
And why shouldn't he give her a hard time when he gets home?
If he didn't, she'd never let him get to sleep.
- That's right.
- Here, give me the bottle.
What a mess women get you in.
Hey.
Save some.
What would a man do without friends?
Come on, come on.
Come on.
Give up a horse for a woman, and you never get back in the saddle.
I'll drink to that.
Now!
Hey, you see? There's nothing to it.
Pick it up and get rid of it.
I'll bet you couldn't do that.
- Now, remember, this is the last.
- I know. I know.
- The very last.
- You told me. I know.
When you play, one bet only on one number. Any number.
You told me. You already explained it. I know.
The fact that I explained it to you doesn't mean you understood.
I underst... I understand.
I wait till the place opens tomorrow night.
I go in like a newborn baby.
I change the money. I make a bet.
I play any number.
And for at least one day, you'll have to keep your mouth shut.
Your gun.
What?
Come on, we're wasting time.
I feel naked without it.
Oh, and another thing.
This time, if you get even one little idea in that worm-eaten head of yours...
...I'll kill you.
He's not like me, you know. He'll do it.
But this doesn't explain anything.
The explanation must be in the cellar. Look.
Simple, isn't it?
Thomas, go up into the garret and say something into that tube we saw.
A magnet.
Two people are enough to control the game.
One above, who decides the winning number, and one here, who places this on the same number.
Evidently, the little ball contains a small amount of iron to make it obey.
Put your ear to that thing.
- "Ninety-nine."
- Don't yell, idiot. Don't yell!
I wasn't yelling, Hutch.
All right, Thomas, come down.
You understand now?
I'm not a fool.
Now all we have to do is wait.
"Guapo".
Guapita.
"Ay".
Te siento.
Wanna go upstairs?
Buy me a drink?
A drink?
Here we go.
OK.
Take it easy. Instead of bringing him to his senses, you'll kill him.
But they're only love taps.
That's what you think.
- Everything all right?
- Everything's fine.
- "Dead?"
- No.
- Deep sleep.
- "Well, tie him up."
And if you have any trouble, knock twice, but softly.
This thing's more sensitive than it looks.
- I know.
- "Now, be careful."
Here come the pigeons.
- Good evening, sir.
- Evening.
A little music never bothered anyone, don't you agree?
Now, you have to tell us a few things, right?
- I've got a family.
- Exactly.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
Place your bets, please.
Get your chips on the numbers.
Damn it. All I wanna know is where the hell that imbecile is.
You can't do it.
I haven't earned a dollar in three or four weeks.
I don't have it.
A debt owed is a debt to be paid.
- It's your problem, Al.
- Wait until Saturday.
Afraid not.
I can tell by the look in your eye you're dying for a little game.
I never play. It's a habit of mine.
Well, it's time we change those bad habits.
Shall we sit down?
Don't worry.
Nobody will see us.
We'll play a little game of cards.
A very simple game.
Hold up your hand up like that.
One for you, one for me.
You have a ten, I have a six. You win.
Queen for you, king for me. I win.
Of course, the ace is always high.
You like it?
No.
Now you like it?
Yes, sir.
All right, come on.
We haven't got much time to lose.
Come on, smile.
Gambling's good for the spirit.
Three for you, five for me. I win, huh?
Looks good for me.
Ten for me. I win, huh?
Nine for you, three for me.
I win again.
King for you, nine for me. I win, huh?
Six.
Eight.
I still win.
Here he comes, flat-headed idiot.
Thank you.
Now, watch out.
The real game's gonna start.
Hi.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen.
Here we go. The gentleman would like to have some change.
All bets down, please. No more bets.
No more bets.
I pay 13 black.
Here you are, mister. 1,750 dollars.
Let me see.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
Place your bets, please.
Get your chips on the number down there.
Leaving it all, sir?
Leave it all. Leave it all.
- Go on. All hell's gonna break loose.
- Right.
Thirteen black.
Thirteen black wins again.
Pay it.
What the hell's going on?
Let's check upstairs.
Right. Let's go.
...which we have chosen for our city,
Law and Order...
...is the expression of an ideal by which I've lived, well, long before I came to settle here with you.
Nay, these words, "law" and "order", have been, are and always will be the very basis of my life.
Thank you.
And so I want to thank you for the honors that you've bestowed upon me tonight, and especially Mr. Piggot.
Mr. Piggot, whose cascade of flowery phrases has warmed the cockles of my heart.
A round of applause for Mr. Piggot.
Just a second. Let's hear what Mr. Drake still has to say.
We can't accept bets over 10,000 dollars, sir.
Why?
The house limit is 10,000.
And how much does that come to if I win?
360,000 dollars.
Really?
All right.
You get that thing spinning.
Still on number 13?
Yeah.
It would be a miracle.
I believe in miracles.
The fool doesn't even try to keep up appearances.
Thirteen again.
Thirteen again.
No bets down after the first turn of the wheel.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets, please.
Place your bets.
Faites vos jeux.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets, please.
All bets down, please.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets.
Place your bets, please.
- You better play regular.
- By all means.
Certainly.
Wait! Wait for me! Drake!
Drake, don't leave me! Drake! Wait!
Wait for me, Drake! They're coming!
Don't leave me, Drake!
They're coming!
Thirteen! Oh!
- Pay him.
- I can't pay it all, Mr. Drake.
He just broke the bank.
Pay him!
And send for the sheriff.
I know this fella very well.
I wouldn't be in such a rush if I were you.
Oh, so it's a holdup, eh?
In a way. But not by us.
Am I right?
Or would you like to have the sheriff look around?
- Maybe in the garret.
- What's he talking about?
What's all this about?
If I may give a little advice in this situation,
I'd resolve it in only one way.
All right.
Slow down, gents. Drop your belts.
If I were you, I'd just take it easy.
Your way of doing things is gonna bring you bad luck, Your Highness.
Don't you touch him.
Remember, he's mine!
All right, Caco.
Now, then, Your Highness.
Will you have this man who won fair and square paid off?
Why don't you take care of it afterwards.
No, this time we'll do it our way.
Or you got something against that?
- All right, as long as you do it quickly.
- Easier done than said.
Don't forget the small change.
I wonder if it works.
It works. Only, I wouldn't use it if I were you.
- What?
- You're getting your money back.
That's fine. But what about us?
If this gambling house is really crooked, these yellow-bellies have been tricking us for years.
Let's take a look into this dirty setup, and if what the man said is true, we'll make sure he gets what's coming to him.
No!
You should have thought of this before.
Get down, all of you. Down!
They leave, and we're finished.
These animals will tear us apart.
What are you muttering about?
I was saying it would be better if you did leave.
After all, it would be impossible for me to fight against a Negro on equal terms.
Have I made myself clear?
Now, Maurice, I beg of you to make an exception in this case.
After all, the color of a man's skin is sometimes nothing compared to, well, a specimen like this, a lice-infected jailbird...
...who walks in where he obviously doesn't belong...
...and takes over as if he owns the place.
Am I right, Cacapopoulus?
Or whatever the hell it is you call yourself now.
Am I right?
Is that a man?
A real man?
But... But you were once my friend.
You hear that, Maurice?
You tell me if it's possible.
As far as I know, the only feeling that you could possibly arouse is one of...
...pity.
Ah, you still scratch yourself, do you?
See?
You've talked too much even for me.
Come on, gents. Here's your artillery.
Give them to them too.
The checkroom's an arsenal.
Let's go. Get a move on.
Well...
...we'll have to have some sort of a signal, won't we?
We'll use this.
When it stops, huh?
Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Fifteen years I've dreamed of this moment.
Fifteen years.
Every night.
Every night.
And so?
There's always music.
The music of violins.
A slow, sweet waltz.
I want music.
He wants music.
Play it!
Need anything else?
Clown.
A rope around that fine, perfumed neck.
Think about it.
Not a bad idea, huh?
A beautiful rope you can see through the bars of the cell they'll put you in.
A good, strong rope, waiting for you.
Calling to you.
Hey.
You won't change your mind, huh?
No, I told you. You can count on it.
My grandfather used to say...
I bet that imbecile got himself killed.
Ten will get you 100 he didn't.
OK?
I think you lost, Hutch.
Don't move!
The last wish of an old friend must be respected.
Don't you agree?
We are gathered here today to consign the mortal remains of Millard Frymore, or whatever his name really was.
I ain't really got a lot to say about Millard because he only rode amongst us two days ago, and was promptly struck down by whatever deadly disease it was struck him down.
We can only hope that whatever deadly disease it was, it wasn't particularly contagious.
And with that in mind I suggest we all bow our heads in devout prayer.
Heavenly father, we hereby consign to your tender mercies, all that remains...
Get out! Get out!
All that remains of one Millard Frymore, origin unknown, cause of death unknown, and of considerable concern to those of us who'd been thrown into contact with him during the last two days.
Millard was struck down in what was evidently the prime of his life.
In fact, he was took from us so fast, he never even got a chance to unpack his suitcase.
However, in as much as we were the last to know poor Millard here on earth and in so far as we were all drawn to this godforsaken country in search of a common goal,
I'm certain you'll agree with me when I...
- Hey, Pa!
- What is the matter with you?
- Take a look!
- Ain't you got any reverence for anything?
- It's gold!
- What?
Take a look, it's gold.
I'd like to remind everyone we're here to consign the remains of Millard Frymore.
- It's gold, Henry!
- Gold!
Down there, in the grave.
Whoa!
Get this coffin away! And have a look.
Oh, no, you don't!
Get out of my gold mine!
Get out of my gold mine!
Get out of my gold mine!
Gold! Gold! Gold!
Gold!
It just doesn't seem possible that a town could get itself in this condition in the short time it's been in existence.
Lynchings, gunfights, and that drunken revelry going on at Madame Orr's House 24 hours a day.
I tell you, a decent woman is not safe on these streets.
Oh, I think the women are safe enough for the most part.
I mean, we only got a couple that would be of much interest to anyone...
Outside the dance hall girls and they're pretty good at handling themselves in a pinch.
Or in a ticklish situation.
Oh, well, now this may be very funny to the members of the town council, but we mine owners haven't found anything to laugh about since we started in business.
We don't think it's funny, Tom.
We just don't know what to do about it.
Maybe what we need is a new mayor and a town council that does know what to do about it.
Now what kind of talk is that?
We all know that the reason I'm mayor and the others are councilmen is because nobody else wanted the jobs.
And don't forget, Tom, we're mine owners ourselves.
Do you enjoy giving 20% of everything you take out of the mines to the Danby family?
Why would we enjoy it?
Well, all right, then let's do something about it.
What? You all know the situation.
There's us, here in Calendar.
There's Galena, where we've gotta ship our gold.
And there's the Danby ranch, halfway in between the two.
The road even runs through their property.
All right, fine. Then we'll build the road around their property.
How? They own that whole valley!
Besides, if they don't get their 20% they just hold up every stage that comes through and take all of it.
All right, all right!
But we've got to do something, even if it means bringing troops in here.
Troops?
- Troops?
- Troops?
What troops? From where?
The nearest troops are 500 miles.
All right, then we'll recruit our own.
How? We can't even recruit enough dishwashers.
How are we gonna recruit any troops?
Nobody wants to stop prospecting long enough to take a bath, let alone join an army.
It all happened so fast we just ain't had a chance to really get organized yet.
And the Danbys are taking advantage of it.
There goes one of them now.
- Which one is he?
- Joe.
Out of the father and three brothers he's about the second toughest.
They all act like they own the place.
The way things are set up right now, they do.
And it's gonna stay that way till we can find ourselves a sheriff that doesn't turn tail and run the minute someone takes a shot at him.
Whiskey.
All right, you all saw it, and it was a fair fight.
He drew first. So it was self-defense.
Uh-huh, I told you, he drew first.
Sure as anything.
Oh, you could call it anything else but self-defense.
Well, it may have been a lot of things, but self-defense it wasn't.
And he didn't draw first. You did.
What do you mean by that?
Oh, it's an old trick.
You did it pretty well.
Not real well, but pretty well.
You feinted with your left shoulder, getting him to go for his gun while you were going for yours with your right hand at the same time.
It's an old Arizona trick, but I have seen it used as far north as Montana.
Are you calling me a liar?
Well, now you heard every word I said, and I didn't call you a liar.
All I said was you feinted him into drawing with your left shoulder while you were going for your gun with your right hand.
So what?
You beat that poor man to the draw.
He's dead and you're alive.
That's the whole idea of the game, isn't it?
What's your name?
Jason McCullough. What's yours?
Joe Danby, and you had better remember it.
Oh, I'll remember it, Joe.
That's about all I'm going to do the rest of my life, is go around remembering your name.
- The bread's on the table in front of you.
- Thanks.
Oh! Why, you!
This one of Emma's Tasty
Home Cooked Meals?
That's it, mister.
They charge $3 for this, huh?
That's what they call inflation.
Sometimes it catches you right in between mouthfuls.
Is there really any gold in this town?
How long did it take you to get that?
All yesterday afternoon, good part of this morning.
Where could a man find a place to sleep?
If you mean a room, you can't.
Down at the end of the street, get a cot.
- How much?
- $20. Eight-hour shift.
Say a man was willing to go to work to get himself a stake.
How would he go about it?
You don't want a job?
No. I figure the way prices are around here,
I'll go broke about 2:30 this afternoon.
We got a bulletin board with that kinda stuff down at the assay office.
Hmm? Oh, thank you.
Hold it! Hold it!
Okay, go head on.
Fight!
- I said, out of my way!
- Heck, go around!
I told you to get out of there!
I'll kill you!
I'll tell you something...
Watch where you're grabbing!
What about you?
What about me?
You want to grab something?
Everything looks too slippery.
What does that mean?
Oh, nothing.
You look too clean to suit me.
- You're gonna get me change.
- Give me a packet.
Are you the man I talk to about...
Wait your turn, mister.
About the job of sheriff?
You interested in the job of sheriff?
Well, maybe. How much does it pay?
Well, none of our sheriffs ever lived long enough to find out.
Look, boys, why don't you all go outside and watch the fight? The ladies, too.
Very good fight out there.
You watch it too, Sam.
Okay, come on!
Let's get out. Get moving. Come on.
All right, let's go.
I'm Olly Perkins, the mayor here.
Jason McCullough.
Fred Johnson, Henry Jackson, Tom Devery, three of our original settlers.
And Fred and Henry are members of the town council.
And I represent the mine owners.
Nice to meet you, gentlemen.
What that fellow said just a minute ago ain't strictly true.
We've had three sheriffs the past two months.
But only two of them got killed.
Oh, what about the other one?
Well, he quit kind of sudden-like.
I don't think he had exactly the right kind of temperament for the position.
Well, you never have said anything about the pay.
Well, for the right kind of man,
$150 a month.
With the spiraling prices you have around here, that'd only allow a man to eat and sleep about eight days a month.
The job includes room and board.
Not at Emma's Food Emporium?
At my house. My daughter does the cooking.
Well, gentlemen,
I think it's only fair to tell you that I'd only be interested in this job on a temporary basis.
Oh?
Well, you see, actually I was on my way to Australia when I heard about your gold strike.
And I decided to, uh, travel through here to see if I could pick up a little stake.
What do you wanna go to Australia for?
Well, it's the last of the frontier country.
I thought I might like to do a little pioneering.
I thought this was frontier country and we was pioneers.
So did I.
To get back to the sheriff's job, if I decided to take it it'd have to be with the understanding that I get enough time off to do the prospecting
I came here to do in the first place.
Well, yeah.
You ain't said nothing yet about your qualifications for the job?
Oh, don't worry about that.
If I take it, you'll be glad you got me.
Well, it ain't just a question of you taking the job, it's also a question of being able to handle it.
Olly, we ain't in much of a position to be choosey.
And him being willing to talk about it at all certainly shows the right attitude.
I don't care what it shows!
I'm the mayor of this town!
It's my responsibility to hire us a sheriff that's not only got qualifications, but that ain't going to get himself killed the first time he sticks his nose out of the door.
Olly, haven't we already...
There you are.
What's your point, Mr. McCullough?
Well, no point, just an exhibition of marksmanship.
The bullet went through the hole in the center.
Yeah, well, maybe it did, maybe it didn't.
Oh, it did. You can take my word for it.
Yeah, well, I'd like to take your word but...
Would you mind doing it again,
Mr. McCullough?
- You want me to do it again?
- If you don't mind.
- Well, I already shot one hole in your roof.
- That's all right.
I hope you didn't take no offense at nothing I may have said earlier, sir.
No, no.
Gentlemen, just to keep the record straight, now a hundred and fifty a month for the room and board is fine, but I've got to do more prospecting.
And, because, basically I'm on my way to Australia, and I wouldn't...
You just name your terms, mister.
We'll rush to meet them.
Fine. As long as everything's straight.
Is there some kind of badge that goes with this job?
Oh, you bet there is!
I'm afraid it's a little bent up.
It must have saved the life of whoever was wearing it.
Well, it sure would have if it hadn't been for all them other bullets flying in from everywhere.
Gentlemen, do we have a jail here?
Do we have a jail?
A brand-new one with two cells that the whole community pitched in, built last month.
Just like a barn raising.
Even the dance-hall girls showed up, made sandwiches, and carried on like crazy.
It was designed to be practically escape-proof.
Oh, good. Because I think I'm gonna have to throw a couple of people in it.
There's only one thing.
This new jail has sure got everything.
Even a new stove with a coffee pot already on it.
The only thing it hasn't got is iron bars for the cells.
You're kidding.
Which we had to send away for 'em and they ain't arrove yet.
But it's got everything else.
It's got glass windows and brooms and kerosene lamps and...
You name it.
- Just no bars for the cells.
- That's right.
Well, all right, I'll think of something.
You ain't wanted for anything anywhere, are you, Mr. McCullough?
Not that it matters, because we understand how them little things can happen.
No. No, I'm not wanted for anything anywhere.
Do you realize the chance you was taking asking him a question like that?
He might have took offense and back out of the whole deal.
I'm the mayor of this town and I got responsibilities.
The question had to be asked!
Mr. Mayor, if I could get some men on this pump over here,
I think we could stop this thing in short order.
Sure thing, Sheriff.
Give us a hand, will you, men?
All right, men! Let her go!
A little more.
Break it up!
Okay, cut it!
What do you think you're trying to do?
Stopping a fight.
Who are you?
I'm the new sheriff.
Oh! We got a new sheriff!
Let's see if he scares as easy as the last sheriff.
Now I want all you people to quit disturbing the peace.
Clean up this mess.
Uh, yes, sir. Anything else?
You got a name?
Jake.
All right, Jake,
I want you go into the Mint saloon.
There's a fellow in there by the name of Joe Danby.
You tell him I remember his name, he's under arrest for murder.
I'll be in to pick him up in not 20 minutes.
You talking to me?
You hard of hearing?
You want me to tell Joe Danby that he's under arrest for a murder?
What are you gonna do after he kills me?
Then I'll arrest him for both murders.
Where's the jail?
Just follow me, Sheriff.
You won't find a better jail for 200 miles.
That is if you can find one at all.
Well, everything seems to be in order.
Our last sheriff was a good organizer.
Yellow clear through, but a good organizer.
We'll be getting the bars in any day now.
Well, that ought to do it.
That ought to do what, Sheriff?
That oughta take care of it till we get the bars in.
Well, I've got my bedroll and few other things over at the stable.
I'd like to go and pick them up, and then get settled in where I'm gonna stay, if you don't mind.
Sure thing, Sheriff.
I've got a nice room for you at my house.
Well, good. Shall we get on over there, and then I'd better pick up that Danby fellow.
Uh, Sheriff, maybe there's something you better know about the Danbys.
Why bother the Sheriff about that stuff now?
He wants to get settled.
Yeah, but, Fred...
We can fill him in on the whole town after he's settled in on the job.
You coming, Mayor?
I'll be right with you, Sheriff.
This is a little bit like murder.
I hope you know that.
Now just 'cause we've lost three sheriffs don't mean we're gonna lose four.
Our luck is bound to change.
What about his luck?
Prudy?
Just put your things over there, Sheriff.
- All righty.
- Prudy!
I want you to meet my daughter, Sheriff.
She's a good cook and a mighty fine looking girl.
Takes after her dear departed mother.
Her mother died, huh?
No, she just departed.
Come on, Sheriff,
I'll show you the parlor.
That little organ there, that come all the way from Dusseldorf.
Most of the furniture was shipped out through St. Louis and Chicago.
- This is my desk where I do my mayor work.
- That's very nice.
I guess you could say this is about the finest house in town.
Well, let me show you the dining room, that's where you'll be having your meals.
Prudy! I want you to meet someone!
This is the dining room.
You sure have a nice place here, Mayor.
Well, thank you, Sheriff.
How about a drink?
Water, if you have some.
- Water?
- Mmm.
Sure thing, Sheriff.
We've got a pump right inside the kitchen.
Right inside the house, huh?
There's the pump, right there.
Uh, Sheriff, before you go down to arrest Joe Danby, a couple of things
I guess you ought to know.
All right.
Well, the Danbys, there's four of them.
Father and three sons.
They're all of 'em pretty tough customers.
Outlaws?
No, not exactly. But in many ways, you might say they're like outlaws.
How is that?
Well, they prefer to do pretty much as they like.
And they get real nasty when anybody tries to stop 'em.
You mean... You mean you don't want me to arrest this boy?
No, I don't mean that at all.
It's just that it's kind of a new idea.
It takes a little bit of getting used to.
I stood right there in that saloon and watched him gun a man down in cold blood.
Oh, I believe you, Sheriff.
I mean it's just the kind of things you'd expect Joe to do.
But are you sure it wasn't self-defense?
Not a chance.
I mean, sometimes, them things happen so fast.
Well, it didn't happen all that fast.
Look, Mr. Perkins, you're the mayor of this town.
And if you order me not to arrest this man, well, you're the boss.
Of course I'll have to give you this badge back
'cause that is no way to run a town, Mayor.
Oh, I agree with you, Sheriff.
I couldn't agree with you more.
And furthermore, I'll expect all the law-abiding citizens of this community to back me up in this job.
Oh, they will, Sheriff.
Well, maybe not all of them at first, not right at first.
You see, it's like I told you,
I'm just on my way to Australia.
You go right ahead and do what you think is best, Sheriff.
I'd better go and alert everybody that...
We're all behind you, Sheriff.
Don't give it another thought.
Uh, you don't need any help with Joe Danby, do you?
No. I can handle it.
Oh, good. Good.
You're the strangest girl I ever met.
Go away.
Do you always show this peculiar side of your nature, or am I just lucky my first day in town?
I suppose you have some reason for sitting up there like that.
Ordinarily, a girl doesn't get undressed, pour a bucket or water over her head, and then go climb a tree.
I'm warning you!
Hi, Mrs. Danvers.
What in the world...
Prudy, is this man bothering you?
Do you know this young lady, ma'am?
Why, of course. That's Prudy Perkins.
She lives right here in this house.
Does she have any past history of, uh, strange behavior like this?
Why, no!
Prudy has always been a sweet, normal, lovable...
Of course there were a couple times last year...
Oh. What happened last year?
Well, wasn't really anything, but at the annual town picnic, she got her hair caught in the ice cream freezer.
I think we ought to be merciful and forget about this whole unfortunate incident, huh, ma'am?
See you, ma'am.
Sheriff, I didn't go down and tell Joe like you asked.
Why not?
'Cause nobody's paying me to take chances like that.
Tell you what, you never know how that Joe is gonna react.
Why should you worry about what Joe thinks?
Because he's mean, Sheriff, and he's nasty.
He enjoys killing people.
All them Danbys enjoy things like that.
You're faster than Joe.
Who says so?
I do. I've seen you both draw.
You're faster than he is.
Supposing it's true, why should the matter ever come up?
Jake.
How would you like a job as my deputy?
I'd hate it.
Even if I lived through it, I'd hate it.
Look, I don't know talked you into taking this job, or how much they're paying you, but you gotta believe me, it ain't enough.
He's expecting you.
Some of these other people told him you was coming.
I hear you're going to try and arrest me.
You know, you don't look near as tough as some of them other sheriffs we've had lately, particularly that old boy who done run off about an hour-and-a-half after he took the job.
Joe, you just make me feel tired all over when you talk like that.
Now what do you mean by that?
It's bad enough to have to kill a man without having to listen to a whole lot of stupid talk from him first.
And remember, Joe, I have seen you draw.
All right, Sheriff, hold it.
Now drop your gun belt.
I couldn't let him shoot you in the back.
Oh, you could have.
Is this the kind of town you people want for yourselves?
Is this the kind of life you want to lead?
I mean, three killings in one saloon alone.
The sun hasn't even gone down yet!
Any more of this foolishness,
I'm gonna close this place up tight.
Yes, sir. I wouldn't blame you a bit, sir.
Pick it up, Joe.
Go on, pick it up.
I'm gonna get you for this, Jake.
Well, you are the toughest-talking blowhard I ever heard.
You might as well come on.
Like it or not, we're on the same side now.
Come on.
Take it easy, boys.
Me and the Sheriff takes a dim view of showoffs with guns.
Remember, the Sheriff said, no more shooting till the sun goes down.
- Is that what he said?
- That's close enough, brother.
Drinks are on the house!
Jake, why don't you look around the desk there and see if you can find yourself a deputy sheriff's badge?
I never said I was taking no job as a deputy.
You're just trying to corner me into this thing, Sheriff.
Well, I'm a little surprised at what's happening to me, too.
You know, I was just riding through here on my way to Australia.
Where do you think you're going?
Well, this is just plain dumb and stupid.
Are you calling the Sheriff stupid?
Do I have to listen to him?
He ain't nothin' but the town character.
Was the town character.
I'm now a Deputy Sheriff, and probably the second-fastest gun around here.
Did you hear that?
Well, he probably is.
And if he isn't, he will be after I've had a chance to work with him for a couple of days.
Come on, Joe.
Joe, the cell on the right is yours.
We don't have any bars yet.
- You're kidding.
- That's what I said.
But we're going to operate just as if the bars were there.
Now you stay on that side of the line.
And everything should work out fine.
What?
While you're in this jail, you stay on that side of the line and you and I will just get along fine.
You expect me to sit here in this lousy cell and that...
What is that red stuff all over the floor there?
Oh, uh...
That's the poor fellow that crossed the line earlier today.
All right, Joe, you just stay right there and behave yourself.
Maybe if you wanted something to read?
Read?
No. No, I guess you wouldn't. Sorry.
Well, I see you found a badge.
Yeah.
Now are we gonna set out to clean up this town?
Yeah, I guess that's about it.
All by ourselves?
Not that we have turned down any help that was cheerfully offered.
Nobody's going to offer no help, cheerful or in any other way.
I think you're probably right, Jake.
How much money am I making in this job?
Well, let's see. I'm the Sheriff.
They're paying me $150 a month.
Shall we put your salary at about half that, plus room and board, plus all the ammunition you need to carry on the job.
Of course, I haven't checked out your employment with the mayor and the town council yet.
You mean there's a chance they might turn me down?
No, I don't think so.
Now I think their attitude is going to be,
"If we found somebody willing to take the job, don't rock the boat."
You can bet that's what their attitude is going to be.
Ever been the sheriff of a town that needed cleaning up before?
No, I haven't.
Ever been a sheriff of any kind of town?
No, not that either.
But the mayor seemed to think that my qualification suited the job perfectly.
Yeah, well, he'd have thought that if you was blind in both eyes and crippled in both legs.
I think you've got the situation pegged, Jake.
Want me to warm some coffee?
I never turn down a cup of coffee in my life.
How long have you been out west?
About four years.
From where?
East.
I was raised up in Indiana.
Well, that could be either good or bad.
Uh, them four years you've been out west, what you been doing?
Mostly, I've been on my way to Australia.
For four years?
Well, it takes some people little longer than others.
What's in Australia?
Well, lots of things. You'd be surprised.
Any other questions, Jake?
Oh, I... There's no...
No, no, no, that's all right.
If there's anything I want, it's a deputy who's at ease in his mind about everything.
Well, you ain't got one.
I don't know where you're gonna get one in this town either.
Why Australia?
Well, you'd know if you'd ever read a book about it.
I ain't never even seen a book about it.
Well, they got one up in the library in Chicago.
If you're ever up that way, you ought to take a look at it.
They got pictures and everything.
You know, they got some little people over there about like that.
And they got a stick that when they throw it away, it comes right back at 'em.
They got some animals over there...
They got one that hops and will box you and carries things in its tummy.
When you, uh, shot that friend of Joe's in the back, you fired two shots.
I figured they went in, oh, about that far apart, huh?
Pretty sloppy shooting, Jake.
Well, I was in a hurry to save your life.
I wasn't trying to group my shots.
If he'd been five feet further away, you'd have missed him entirely.
I'd say that was pretty pitiful showing, Jake.
- You see that bottom nail on the right?
- Yeah.
- That's weird.
- What's weird?
That anybody can shoot like that.
Oh, it's just a matter of practice.
Then how come nobody ever heard of you?
I mean, a man that can shoot like you do and draw as fast as you can, how come you ain't got a reputation?
What would I want with a reputation?
That's a good way to get yourself killed.
Now you just go on practicing while I put Joe back in jail.
Joe.
I took the bullets out.
You just won't play the game, will you?
I keep laying down the rules.
You don't pay any attention.
You just wait till my pa and two brothers find out that you got me in here, boy.
Oh, I'm looking forward to meetin' your whole family.
Come on.
Ain't bad enough that I had to be dragged out of that saloon in front of all my friends.
Oh, I doubt if you have all that many friends that you need to be upset, Joe.
Then I have to sit there in that lousy cell.
Pa is gonna skin me alive for getting caught.
He won't mind you murdering that man, he just doesn't like for you to get caught, huh?
I didn't murder anybody, that was self-defense.
It was him or me.
Well, we'll let the judge decide that.
We do have a judge around here, don't we?
We never needed one till you come to town and ruined everything.
Spoiled all your fun, huh, Joe?
You can say that again.
Oh, that's funny.
That's real funny.
I hope you ain't got no religious convictions against drinking, Sheriff?
Not since I gave up my parish.
I'm only kidding, Mayor.
Uh, Mayor, what about my deputy?
No problem.
But I'm curious as to why you picked Jake.
Well, Jake backed me up when it really counted.
I'd have to wait and find that out about another man.
Then it might be too late.
How about a judge?
Well, the need for one ain't exactly been felt up to now.
That's what Joe said.
But if I can't appoint one, who can?
That must have been some show you put on at the saloon this afternoon.
Kind of sobered up the town.
Well, that's good.
Maybe, maybe not.
It has been a lot of fun around here up to now.
I mean, everything all kinda wide open and relaxed.
Nobody lookin' down their noses at anybody who happen to shot somebody else.
Nobody poking their noses into nobody else's business without them getting their big noses blasted off in the process.
Ah, I guess now that we got law and order, churches will start moving in.
Yeah, that's usually the next thing that happens.
And then the women will start forming committees, and having bazaars.
Then they'll chase Madame Orr's girls outta town, or make 'em get married, or something even worse.
But what the hell.
Like you said, the law's the law and we all gotta face up to it sometime.
Oh, when did I say that?
Well, you know what I mean.
Well, I was just a little short of money when you offered me this job.
But you didn't have to take it.
I mean, there's dozens of other jobs around.
Well, don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna keep it too long.
Remember, I'm just passing through on my way to Australia.
I'll drink to that.
What are you doing?
You was on fire, Prudy!
Prudy, you was on fire!
Fire?
I'm sick and tired of these stupid things that have been happenin' to me!
And somebody'd better do something about it soon!
Well, that's quite a daughter you got yourself there, Mr. Mayor.
I think she's crazy.
Well, why would you think like that?
I know what I'd think.
She's had some terrible shocks this year.
She got wealthy almost overnight.
I think maybe it unhinged her a little bit.
Then she was always kind of big for her age.
And puberty hit her hard.
That'll do it, you know.
- I didn't know that.
- Well, it will!
As a disinterested stranger, how does she hit you?
Well, she, uh...
I mean, you are disinterested, ain't you?
Oh, I think you could safely say that, yes.
She's a rich little old gal in her own name, Sheriff.
Sole owner of the Millard Frymore
Memorial Mining Company.
You mean whoever marries her gets the mine?
Shaft and all.
Yeah, well, that won't hurt her in certain circles, will it?
Well, I'd better fry us up something to eat.
Uh, no, thank you, Mayor.
I better go down relieve Jake.
This is his first night on duty, you know.
You're expecting trouble?
- What do you think?
- The Danbys.
Some people think you could've waited a couple of days before you stuck your nose in the biggest hornet's nest we got.
Well, when you set out to clean up a mess, you don't just sit around and watch that mess get bigger and bigger.
I guess you know what you're doing, Sheriff.
I don't know what I could've said to give you that idea, Mayor.
Puberty.
You ain't gonna stick to your plan of handling this all by yourself, are you, Pa?
Since when did it take more than one Danby to take care of a little thing like this?
You know what a tiger you are, Pa.
You're just liable to go chargin' in there...
And then what?
Nothing. I didn't mean nothing.
You ain't got brains enough to mean nothing.
Now you two go on in here and order yourselves a drink.
I'll be back with Joe before you can finish it.
I believe you got one of my children in the jail here.
How dare you walk into my office and pull a gun on me?
Get your finger out of the end of my gun!
How dare you pull a gun on me!
I said take your finger out of the end of my gun!
Well, until I do, you better take your finger off that trigger and let the hammer down real slow.
If that gun went off, it would have blowed right up in my face.
It wouldn't have done my finger a hell of a lot of good, either, would it?
What can I do for you, Mr. Danby?
My son Joe.
Well, it seems Joe murdered a man this afternoon.
The way I hear it, he killed a man in a fair gunfight.
- I was standin' right there.
- You were standin' right where?
In the saloon when Joe killed him.
Well, now, that was real smart of him, wasn't it?
Well, I've been around Joe all afternoon, and I haven't seen him do one smart thing yet.
- Is there anything else?
- Can I see him?
Why didn't you take that approach when you first came in?
He's right in there.
I'm obliged to you.
Hi, Pa.
What is this?
No bars in the window, no bars in the cell.
No bars nowhere.
What's keeping you in here?
That guy out there.
He won't let me move two inches without jumping down my throat.
Besides, he lies to me about whether or not my gun's loaded.
He does what?
Look, are you gonna get me outta here or not?
Never mind that. Who was it you killed?
I don't know his name.
He was some bum in the saloon.
Besides, he drew first.
What, are you gonna believe me or are you gonna believe that liar out there?
Why don't you shut up?
Pa, it wasn't anybody that we know.
Pa, you always told me there wasn't a jail been built that could hold a Danby.
Well, now they built one.
Oh.
Yeah, you'll have to stay here for a couple of days.
But we run this town.
I gotta throw in with that sheriff that you don't exactly dazzle nobody with your intelligence.
Now you just sit tight here till I've had a chance to think this thing out.
Couldn't you have at least done it when the Sheriff weren't looking?
He wasn't the sheriff when he done seen me do it.
Hey, I didn't think of that before.
That could be a loophole to help you get me out of here.
Now don't you try to do nothing about this situation you say of.
You just leave that to me and the boys.
That's a lousy jail you got in here.
Well, we're just getting started.
What's he supposed to be?
Oh, that's my deputy.
Why, last week he was shoveling horse...
He was working in the stable.
Well, he's been promoted.
Oh, I'm gonna find out what's happened to this town.
What did Danby want?
Oh, well, he...
He just came in and we talked a while.
Then he went in to see Joe.
Then he came back out, we talked a little more, and then he left.
You know, he strikes me as being a lonely man.
Lonely? Danby?
Why, he's a mean, no-good, low-down bushwhacker.
Well, now there, you see?
No wonder he's lonely.
He stuck his finger in the end of your what?
Would you shut up.
Everybody'll be lookin'.
Well, I don't really understand what happened, Pa.
You said you had your gun on him.
I ain't gonna sit here and explain it all over again now.
I don't have to explain nothing to you two.
Instead of sittin' here askin' a whole lotta questions, why don't you come up with some helpful suggestions?
Why don't the three of us go over there together?
I don't care if he is the fastest gun that'd ever hit anywhere.
Who says he's the fastest gun that'd ever hit anywhere?
Everybody.
That's all they're talking about all over town.
Besides, what could he do against three of us?
He could kill two of us.
You ain't talking like yourself, Pa.
Yeah. It was always you chargin' in and us trying to hold you back.
We ain't just gonna leave Joe in here to get hung, are we?
Well, of course we ain't.
Who says we gotta take care of this sheriff ourselves?
Who says anybody's gotta take care of it?
Why don't we run him outta town like we did the last sheriff?
Because this one won't go.
He didn't throw a scare into you, did he, Pa?
I... I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
I didn't mean...
Did he throw a scare at you?
I just meant, well, what did he do to you, Pa?
He maybe made me a little more thoughtful.
He maybe made me realize that now we've got a little money for the first time in our lives, and the chance to get a lot more, this would be a dumb time to find out who's the fastest with a gun, us or some show-off that might be lucky, even if he wasn't good.
If we don't take care of him, who does?
There's always some tramp that's good with a gun that can be hired.
Yeah, but you always said that the Danbys fight their own battles.
Maybe I was talkin' about another branch of the family.
Now I'm gonna take a little trip tomorrow.
And I want you two to behave yourselves while I'm gone.
I don't want nobody to make no martyr out of this here sheriff.
What's a martyr?
Oh, I'm sorry.
They didn't use words like that in the third grade, did they?
How would I know? I didn't get that far.
Well, you remember when I was stuck all them years in the second grade.
Oh, shut up!
Sheriff?
Can I talk to you a minute?
Sure, Miss Prudy.
Could... Could we sit down?
Sure.
Well...
How can I be of service to you, Miss Prudy?
What?
How can I be of service to you?
What do you mean, service?
I don't think I mean anything by it.
What do you think I mean?
Look, Sheriff,
I'm just a dumb little old girl from a hick little old town in a jerkwater part of the country.
- What?
- Nothing.
You just said you're a dumb little old girl from a little old hick town in a jerkwater...
I know what I said.
Well, all I wanted was to explain some of those stupid, silly things that you saw me doing today.
What stupid, silly things, Miss Prudy?
What stupid...
Well, how about when I burned my dress off?
Well, that could happen to anyone.
Well, how about in the mud when I was trying to defend myself from that common pervert?
Well, that's just one of those things that any overstimulated girl might get herself caught into.
Well, how about in the tree, half-naked, dripping wet?
That one could take a little explanation.
Well, I guess it was just one of those days when everything seems to go wrong.
Actually, every one of those ridiculous things that you saw happen has a perfectly simple explanation.
Not that it matters, really, I just thought it was dumb to go around having such an...
Attractive man thinking
I was a hopeless loony.
Well, loony maybe, but hopeless...
You... You think I'm attractive?
Well...
I don't think that a girl would just curl up and die
'cause you smiled at her, but yes, I think you're attractive.
Well, Miss Prudy.
I can see that you're a young lady who believes in laying her cards on the table.
In what?
Laying her cards on the table.
When a girl does that, well, I think that a man, uh...
Well, he should lay his cards on the table, too.
Anybody can see that you're a very pretty and very attractive girl.
Any man in his right mind would be only too glad to take you out on a picnic or out for a walk in the evening.
Well, I'd feel privileged to do just that.
However, if you're thinking of anything more seriously,
I'm afraid I'll have to warn you
I'm on my way to Australia, and I'm just passing through here.
Why, you conceited...
Conceited? I'm only trying to tell you that I'm on my way to Australia.
Who cares where you're on your way to?
Any girl who is thinking about entering into any permanent relationship would be glad to know that a man...
I'm not thinking of entering into one of those!
What's the matter with you?
Do you think something is the matter with me?
Do I think... There isn't enough time to tell you how much.
Good night!
You all right, Miss Prudy?
You shut up and mind your own business!
Damn, damn, damn!
Prudy?
You shut up, too!
Well, do you see anything?
No. What are we looking for?
"What are we looking for?" We're looking for nuggets, veins, the mother lode.
What's the mother lode?
I'm beginning to get the horrible feeling you know even less about gold-mining than I do, Jake.
Of course I don't know anything about gold-mining.
Well, what do you think
I brought you along for?
I thought everyone around here knew about mining.
Well, I don't.
I might be able to give you a few tips about shoveling horse, working around the stable, but I don't know nothing about hunting gold.
Do you mind I put this stuff down?
No. No, you better not.
If there's anything
I do know about prospecting, it's you've got to keep on the move.
It's heavy.
Well, here, let me redistribute the weight for you.
I feel like a jackass.
Yeah, that ought to do it.
- Come on, Jack.
- Jake.
You're a pretty good fisherman, Jake.
This is more like it, huh?
More like what?
Oh, this is more like the kinda place
I want to go gold-minin' in.
Well, what make you think there's any gold around here?
What makes you think there isn't?
I suppose it don't bother you none that Joe Danby is gonna be miles away by the time we get back?
Not unless he's learned to travel fast handcuffed to a potbellied stove.
Well...
What do we do now?
I think we oughta have lunch, take a little rest, and then you start diggin'.
Hey, Jake, how do you think we oughta split whatever we find?
Sixty, forty?
Sixty for who and 40 for who?
There, you see?
See what gold does to men?
We haven't even found anything and already we're arguing about it.
Sixty for who and 40 for who?
I just wish you could see the greed in your face.
What you mean is 60 for you and 40 for me.
Well, thank you, Jake.
That's very generous of you.
Hey, Jake.
What did you do before you became my deputy?
Well, I did odd jobs.
Well, like what?
Well, for one thing,
I was a whore-holder at Madame Horse's...
Oh. A horse holder at Madame Orr's house.
- You are a what?
- Horse holder.
See, on Saturday night, that hitch rack out front would get full.
I'd hold the extra horses, sometimes all night.
It seems to me like you spent a lot of time with horses.
Mmm. One end or the other.
Course I come by it natural.
My daddy stole horses for a living.
They hung him.
Well, now that's a terrible thing for a sheriff to suddenly find out about his deputy.
If you hadn't been in such a hurry to shove this job down my throat, you might have found out a lot of things.
- Want my badge back?
- Don't be silly.
Jake, you better clean up those fish.
I'll take a little nap.
Sure it won't disturb you none?
No, no, no.
Just don't rattle the pots and pans.
I'll be wantin' you boys to ride into town a little more quietly from now on.
You drove your point home real good.
Good. Good.
Well, that kind of brightens up the whole place.
At least I don't feel so naked and stupid sitting in here day after day.
Joe, if Jake should come in, would you tell him I had to go down to the hardware store to see the mayor.
Have you seen my daddy?
No. Not since the night he came in here and we had that little chat.
Don't you worry, Joe. I'm sure he and your brothers are planning a little jailbreak.
You really think so?
Now what else would they be doing?
Where will I find the Sheriff?
I imagine he's in the jail across the...
No, wait a minute.
There he is now just comin' out of the hardware store there.
Much obliged.
Pleasure.
Sheriff.
Anybody know who he was?
Oh, I think he just rode in to town.
He asked me where you was. I seen you coming out of the hardware store there...
Thanks for pointing me out to him.
Hold it just a minute.
You don't want to go in there right now, honey.
Wait here just a minute,
I'll come back and I'll join you.
Honey, I think I just been...
Did you ever see him before?
Uh-uh.
Uh, Jake.
After lunch, uh...
Good afternoon, Sheriff.
We ain't makin' any dust at all today.
Another one of 'em just rode into town.
- You sure?
- You can't miss a professional gunfighter.
He got a look about him ain't like anyone else, and he's been asking around trying to find you.
I'm sure getting sick of all this stuff.
Yeah, that kinda stuff would make me sick too.
Come on.
Well, why do these jaspers always have to hit town at mealtime?
Are you going to kill another man?
Well, I'm sure we all hope it turns out that way.
This sure is a childish way for a grown man to make a living.
Go for your gun, Sheriff.
You go to hell.
And stay out!
If either of you opens his fat, stupid mouth,
I'll chase you right out of town after that other yellow dog.
Leave the bottle.
All right, now he's done it.
- Who?
- That sheriff.
What's he done?
He's pushed me too far this time.
That's what he's done.
I've been bending over backwards up to now.
But that's all finished.
You know I've been bending over backwards.
Well, you sure ain't let him push you into no corner where you could be provoked till you're losing your temper.
Right. But from now on,
I'm tired of being a nice fella.
Pa, you been touching up your hair again?
What do you mean, again?
Nothing. It just looks better in spots, that's all.
- What do you mean, spots?
- Nothing.
What are we gonna do, Pa?
- Get Joe out of jail.
- How?
Leave that to me.
I got it all figured out.
We'll do it tonight.
Now you get ready.
'Cause this is gonna happen awful fast.
- Pa.
- Huh?
Nothing. It's all right.
Now when I yell go, we all go together.
And use your spurs.
All ready?
- Now he's really done it!
- Who?
That sheriff!
I could've told you all that it wasn't gonna work.
Why not?
Because they set these bars in too solid.
What do you know about anything?
I'm the one that helped to set them in.
You...
Luke, I want you two to round up the horses.
And I want you to ride over to your Uncle Milt's.
You tell him to bring Steve and George and Young Milt.
And Tom, you ride out to Uncle Ira's.
And you tell him to bring Billy and Jack and anyone else he can think to bring.
I ain't foolin' around no longer.
That's a two-day ride to Uncle Ira's.
I know how far it is!
You stop at the ranch and pick up some grub.
And tell Milt and Ira we'll all meet at the ranch Friday.
If any of them feel that they just don't wanna come, you just remind them of the mortgages
I've been helping them to pay.
Well, all right, get going!
What do you mean, you helped 'em put in those bars?
Well, I didn't have nothing else to do.
And they was gonna put the bars in whether I helped them out or not.
Yeah, well, they'll hang you whether you're helping out or not.
Pa, I don't think that they are really gonna hang me.
I mean, you know, they laugh and they joke about it a lot, but I don't think they're really gonna do it.
Eh, you'll see whether they hang you or...
Don't move.
What's going on back here?
Well, that's all I need, some stable bum ordering me around.
Now this is my saddle and I'm taking it with me.
I know it ain't mine, so go ahead.
In just a few days now,
I'll take care of you.
What was he tryin' to do, bust you outta here?
Yeah.
But you know Pa.
Got a heart as big as the whole outdoors, but he don't have one brain in his poor old head.
May I compliment you on getting such a romantic idea, Miss Prudy?
There's nothing romantic about it, Sheriff.
Nothing romantic about a man and a girl out for a ride on a warm afternoon?
You think what you want to, Sheriff.
But you'd do that anyway, wouldn't you?
It's surprising how well you've gotten to know me in such a short time, Miss Prudy.
Would you like to get out and talk a minute, Sheriff?
All right.
Light yourself up a cigar if you want to, Sheriff.
Well, thank you, Miss Prudy.
I believe I will.
Was there, uh, anything in particular that you want to talk to me about, Miss Prudy?
Well, in case you didn't know,
Milt Danby is rounding up his two brothers and all of their sons and all of their hired hands.
And they're going to ride into town, and they're gonna take care of you and Jake and they're gonna get Joe out of jail.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Well, we've all been trying to remember.
And we think there are three grown boys in Ira Danby's family and two in Milt Danby's family.
So, with the three Danbys here and Joe in jail, we figure that makes about 11.
Oh, plus all of the hired hands that they may want to bring along.
Well, that's about the figure
I arrived at, too, 10 or 12 maybe.
Or 14 or 15 maybe.
It's quite a few.
It's almost a mob, you might say.
Have you figured what you're gonna do?
More or less.
What?
I thought I might just leave town.
Just get out of town before they ride in.
Just ride out and keep on going.
I don't believe it.
I don't know why not.
I've never made any secret of the fact that basically I'm on my way to Australia.
I don't think I'm gonna find a better time to get started than right now.
Besides, I don't like the odds.
I just don't believe it.
Well, you better believe it.
It's not gonna be too many hours before you look up and I'll be long gone.
I think that that is one of the most mature things
I've ever heard of a man doing.
What... You think it's what?
Mature.
Almost any other man would have to stick around to prove that they are a man and get a whole town shot up to boot.
Mature?
Mature, as opposed to childish and shot full of holes.
You don't think it sounded a little cowardly?
I mean, for a man to take a job and then when the going gets a little rough, he just sneaks out in the dead of night.
Well, of course you didn't say whether you're gonna do it in the day or the night.
But the point is didn't it sound a little cowardly to you?
No, I told you, it sounds mature.
Well, it sounded a little cowardly to me just now when I said it.
Well, it isn't. It's mature.
The reason I know it's cowardly is because I've never done a cowardly thing in my life, no matter what you or anybody else might think.
I didn't say...
And it isn't mature. It is cowardly.
Now let's just call things by the right name from now on, huh.
What is the matter with you?
I'm just surprised at a girl who keeps throwing herself at a man when she secretly thinks he's a coward.
Let's go back to town.
What do you mean, throwing myself at you?
Did you really think that I was gonna turn tail and run at the first sight of trouble?
What... Why shouldn't I? That's what you just said you were gonna do.
Well, I'm not going to, so you just forget about it.
All right. Order! Order!
Now you all heard the motion.
Those in favor, raise your hands.
Count it, Henry.
One, two, three, four, five.
Now, those in favor of not getting involved in the crisis which is about to befall our fair community.
In other words, keeping the hell off the streets and out of the way till the shooting is over, raise your hands.
Count 'em, Henry.
Five, 10, 15...
I think we passed the motion.
Order! Order!
Be it so entered in the books of the town council that the majority has ruled.
And as your mayor...
I object!
Get that gun away from her.
You can't do this.
You just shut up and sit down, Prudy.
This is a meeting of the town council and certain select prominent citizens of this community.
And you can't walk in off the street and insult everyone.
I just wanna one question.
How many of you are gonna help the sheriff against the Danbys?
Oh, no, wait a minute.
It's not as simple as that, Prudy.
Why not?
Because there are factors to be considered. Economic factors.
It could affect the wellbeing of everyone in this town.
Besides, I heard that the Sheriff is gonna leave town.
I did too. At the time I heard it,
I remember saying to myself,
"That sheriff has his head set squarely on his shoulders."
Well, now he's not gonna leave town.
And I'd like to get my hands on whoever was it caused him to change his mind.
Me too.
A man with that good an idea oughta be encouraged to hold onto it.
What is the matter with all of you?
Don't you remember how long we waited to find a man who would stand up to the Danbys?
Do you remember what this town was like before him?
Murdering, lynching, miners shooting up the town day and night.
And aside from the few things that you just mentioned, it wasn't a bad place at all.
Oh, sure, we had a little misunderstanding with the Danbys at times.
But they could all be worked out in time.
What about Joe Danby in jail for murder?
Well, that would've solved itself too if the sheriff had left town like he promised to.
I said it before and I'll say it again.
The men in this town are nothing but a bunch of low-down miserable, cowardly curs.
As your father, I may have to take that kind of talk from you.
But as the mayor of this town,
I sure as hell don't.
Throw her out, boys!
And don't be too gentle with her.
Don't let her tie herself to that post!
It's another trick of hers, tying herself to things whenever she doesn't wanna do something.
Death to all tyrants!
What did she say?
She said death to somebody or other, but it doesn't mean anything.
She's always saying death to somebody she's mad at.
Order! Order!
Well, you might as well forget about getting any help from anybody in this town, or from anybody for 100 miles around.
Oh, that takes care of just about everybody, doesn't it?
They can throw an unarmed girl out of a public meeting but they can't even defend their own town against a bunch of cutthroats like the Danbys.
Well, what are we going to do now?
- "We"?
- Don't turn down any help you can get.
How is Joe?
Oh, he figures he's gonna be outta here and we're gonna be dead about this time tomorrow.
Did he seem to feel any sorrow over the fact that we might all be killed?
No, it's more like he planned to dance and spit all over our graves.
That sounds like Joe.
Sure was an awful good idea you had about leavin' town.
Oh, you don't have to stay.
Oh, yes, I do.
I gotta stay if you do 'cause I took the job.
So did I.
I'll tell you what.
I'll even go to Australia with you if we leave right now.
Oh, we'll go to Australia all right, but first we got a few things to do, and I think it's about time we got started.
Prudy, do you really wanna help?
Sure.
Well, the first thing we gotta do is get Joe outta here.
Then what are we gonna do?
Oh, I got a couple of ideas.
If things work out right, we might live through this thing.
I sure liked his idea about leaving.
Now Prudy, you go in the courthouse.
Do you know how to use this?
Here, you'll need these.
- Jake, are you there?
- Yeah.
You know what you're supposed to do?
Oh, yeah! Yeah.
Keep out of the line of fire whenever I can.
- Mayor...
- Can't talk to you now, Sheriff.
We've got an emergency meeting at the town council.
Now what's that all about?
You don't think I'm not gonna shoot through the window, do you?
Here, take care of these, my eating teeth.
I don't want to get them all shot up.
Get Joe.
He ain't in there, Pa.
Hold it!
You're under arrest.
Throw down your guns and I'll accept your surrender.
Haven't you ever heard of just wounding somebody?
I only know one way to shoot, and that's to kill.
Well, we don't want a massacre on our hands, so just watch it.
Hold it! Hold it!
Settle down out there.
Just hold it.
Okay, go ahead!
- Hey, Jason, where'd you put Joe?
- Got him upstairs, there.
Go get him.
Pa, look.
Your teeth, they saved my life.
Always worrying about your life!
How am I supposed to jaw with from now on?
Pa, look!
I want all you people to unstrap your gun belts and throw your rifles down, or I'm gonna have to set this thing off.
You don't think you're gonna bluff me out with that old cannon, do you?
Why, it ain't even loaded.
- Well, shall we see?
- Believe him, Pa!
You stay out of this, you miserable coward!
Well, what's it going to be, Danby?
Jake, let Joe loose.
Put the rest of that bunch in jail.
By myself?
I'll be right behind you.
You weren't gonna really blow him up, were you?
Oh, of course not.
That thing isn't loaded.
I just stuck that fake fuse in there.
See?
Wow!
My business!
I'll find out who's responsible for this outrage if it's the last thing
I ever do, Madame Orr.
Disturbing the peace, that's what it is.
I don't care if you're cleaning up this town.
That was a terrible thing to do to them poor unfortunate girls.
Well, I didn't know that damn thing was loaded.
I've never done anything to an unfortunate girl in my life.
Ah!
Some of those girls are the closest friends I've got.
Well, well, who have we here?
It's the Sheriff.
- It's the Sheriff, boys.
- We know who it is.
Everybody in the territory knows who our sheriff is these days.
I guess Devery's right at that, Sheriff.
I imagine you're about the most popular and respected citizen we've got around here.
Well, that's nice to hear.
In fact, we're thinking about sending a delegation to Washington to see about turning this territory into a state.
We'd be proud if you'd head up that delegation.
Oh, no, no, no.
You wanted somebody who's gonna be here.
Oh, now, Jason, if you're upset with us about that Danby business...
We were behind you all the way, Sheriff.
I can see where it might not have looked that way, but...
No, that's not it. It's just that, well...
I've never made any secret of the fact that basically I'm on my way to Australia.
Which reminds me,
I'm gonna have to think about getting started again one of these days.
Would you excuse me, gentlemen?
A small crisis needs to be handled.
Jump, Miss Prudy!
Jump!
Boys, I just want you to know that from now on when you pick on this young lady, you'll be picking on my girl.
We didn't have any idea the wind blew that way, Sheriff.
Well, now you know it.
You might, uh, spread the word around town.
Yes, sir.
What do you mean, your girl?
Prudy, for once in your life, play it smart and keep your big, fat mouth shut.
You keep out of this.
What do you mean, your girl?
Oh, come on, you've had that look in your eye since the first day I hit town.
Uh, we're gonna have a little agreement.
After we're married, no matter how many kids we got, when I say we're off to Australia, we pack up, kids and all, and off we go.
What do I wanna go to Australia for?
Because that's where your husband would be, and girls usually go where their husbands are.
Oh.
When you put it that way...
Why don't you put me down?
Oh, I like it like this.
You, uh, want me to walk you home?
If you want to, Sheriff.
Say, uh...
Are you really one of the richest girls in this part of the country?
The richest.
Well, that's nice. That's real nice.
Now, the way this story ends is that they get married.
And he goes on to become governor of the state.
He never gets to Australia, but he keeps reading a lot of books about it.
I get to be sheriff of this town, then I go on to become one of the most beloved characters in Western folklore.
Come on, kids, out of the street.
Come on, kids, get back there.
Hey, you. Get out of there!
Get out of the street!
Get out of the street!
Clear the street!
Get away from there!
Get out of the way, old man.
Can't you hear?
Can't you see you're in the way?
Get out of here!
- All right.
- Out of the way!
Watch out, old-timer.
You got a good horse, but not good enough. I'll have that dollar.
I'm beginning to figure these races smell bad.
That thing never loses.
- You had your chance.
- Well, let's just say I'm a poor loser.
So if you want this dollar...
...you just come right on over here and get it, sonny boy.
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.
Step right up and try your luck.
Everybody welcome.
See the Oregon Kid in person.
Right this way, folks.
Come one, come all.
Step right up and outshoot the famous Oregon Kid.
The last of the Western town-tamers.
Fatten your wallets and be a hero to your family. Everybody welcome.
Step up. Try your luck. All you gotta do is hit the plates, and you win the money.
- Quit the sermon and turn her loose.
- One dollar on the yellow.
Shooting against you is like sneaking licorice from a baby girl.
Care to try again?
Mister, could I make a 10-cent bet?
A whole dime? You're a plunger, sir.
Well, I ain't so altogether sure I could hit a moving target without buckshot.
I used to be fair with a scattergun...
...but then that was when the bird wasn't too far away or flying too fast.
Them plates, I just don't see how you manage.
Well, I'll be damned.
- How are you, Gil?
- No great complaints.
How long has it been?
Lordy, I'd hate to say.
Quite some time.
Where you been all these years?
Here and there.
Quite a little enterprise you've got.
Well, Steve, it's easier than punching cows...
...and it pays off with free drinks when I walk into a saloon.
Would it surprise you that the Oregon Kid is the envy...
...of every small-minded ribbon clerk and shirttail towhead from here to Pocatello?
Well, why not?
All these single-handed exploits.
Tell me, Gil, who was the Omaha gang?
I don't seem to recollect them fellers.
Flagstaff, Monterey, Hondo,
I remember we worked them places.
Dodge City and Wichita.
Did you ever run with the Earp boys, Gil?
You gotta allow for exaggeration.
That's part of playing the game.
That's not much of a game. A blind man couldn't miss using buckshot.
It must be something important to bring you here.
Looks like you've been riding a long time but not getting far.
Job.
You mean you're still at it?
Federal marshal?
No, working for the bank.
You, a bank guard?
I'm transporting gold from the mining camp up there to the bank down here.
Gold bullion, $250,000 worth, the way the letter put it.
A quarter of a million.
And I could use some help.
Can you recommend anyone?
- I'll give it some thought.
- You do that, will you?
- And let me know.
- I will, Steve. I surely will.
What do you figure we're gonna do?
Drink champagne, kid, and only the best.
About $250,000 worth.
- I'd like to see Mr. Samson, please.
- He's busy.
Would you tell him it's Mr. Judd.
Stephen Judd.
Just one minute.
Excuse me, sir.
Mr. Judd.
Have him come in, Abner.
Mr. Samson will see you.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Judd?
I'm Luther Samson, and this is my son, Abner.
- He's the vice president.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Mr. Judd.
Well, I must say, Mr. Judd,
I expected a much younger man.
- Well, I used to be. We all used to be.
- Yes. Yes, of course.
Mr. Judd, we're more than familiar with your reputation.
But that was made many years ago, and we're dealing in the present, not the past.
What's the problem?
The Coarsegold strike is on the crest of the Sierras.
There's only one trail. One in, one out.
Six miners have been killed trying to get their gold to us.
Six miners killed and robbed, Mr. Judd.
Several weeks ago we petitioned for a marshal, but nothing happened.
The only law there is too drunk to hit the ground with his hat.
The man we send must be completely reliable, to say nothing of being honest.
We're speaking of gold, Mr. Judd.
Twenty thousand dollars worth.
Twenty thousand?
Why, I thought your letter said 250,000.
Our original estimate was overly enthusiastic.
The strike isn't a mother lode, but it's productive. Slow and steady.
- And we intend to get our share.
- The days of the forty-niners are past...
...and the days of the steady businessmen have arrived.
My usual fee is $20 a day.
I'll have to charge you 40.
- Forty dollars a day?
- For what?
For two extra men. I don't intend to go four days without sleeping.
- The question is...
- Can I do it?
I can't answer that by talking, only by doing it.
If you two wanna talk about it, you go ahead, and I'll read the contract.
Well, I guess that'll be all right.
- In private, if you please.
- Well...
...you can go in there.
Well, the contract's all right.
How about me? Any doubts?
If not, I'll sign it.
Well, I guess it's all right.
That old man is Steve Judd?
He don't look like much to me.
Son, I wore a star for six years with that old man.
I was his deputy most of the time.
Once he was mine.
Don't ever play him short.
I just don't figure him to be any trouble, that's all.
I hope you're right, boy.
I surely hope you're right.
I'll be at the lion. You demonstrate how impressed you are, with your mouth shut.
- Hi, Mr. Westrum.
- Evening, honey.
Hello, Heck.
- Stop that!
- What did I do?
Never mind what you did.
Don't do it in here.
- Can I pick you up in an hour?
- I think so.
Too bad, because Heck won't be there.
- Why not?
- Because if I can't, you won't.
- Still keeping records, eh?
- You know me. Creature of habit.
Somebody else wants to know you.
My partner, Heck Longtree.
You'd blush to hear the way he admires you.
- How do you do?
- Howdy.
Have a chair.
Showing your age, aren't you?
Interfering in a young man's love life.
He's got more important things on his mind. Haven't you?
Haven't you? Yes, sir, and so have I.
Been considering your problem. Think
I can solve half, perhaps the whole thing.
I know a fellow who's got an overwhelming hankering...
...for a little old-time activity.
A man would have to be pretty hard up to want to risk his life for $ 10 a day.
Ten dollars a day?
Not hard up. Just fed up.
Outshooting rubes for nickels and dimes.
Takes free drinks to put me to sleep.
My partner feels the same way.
- Don't you?
- Yeah.
- I don't think I'd wanna hire a boy.
- What do you mean, a boy?
Steve, this boy's a good deal less than green.
- He can't have much behind him.
- That's where you're wrong.
He's been dogging after me for better than three years.
Pretty.
Too bad he can't keep it clean.
Boys nowadays. No pride.
No self-respect.
Plenty of gall, but no sand.
- Now, you take that race today...
- What about that race?
Well, at that distance, no horse in the world could beat a camel.
Are you calling me a cheat?
Well, if he don't, I will.
Go get them, tiger.
You're doing fine. Just fine.
- What do you think, Steve?
- I think he's wonderful.
He'll do. He'll do just fine.
What's the matter, partner?
Your rheumatism bothering you?
I'm used to working with my brain, not my backside.
- You think you can talk him into it?
- One way or another.
I'd just as soon we'd split it two ways instead of three.
Kid, you've got an awful lot to learn.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
Joshua Knudsen's the name.
This is Gil Westrum and Heck Longtree.
My name is Judd. Stephen Judd.
- I've heard the name.
- We're on our way to Coarsegold.
Could you furnish accommodations for the night?
I've got no room in the house, but I won't object if you wanna stay in the barn.
Thank you, sir. If you could spare us a few eggs, we'd be glad to pay for them.
Well, one you can have. Because the Lord's bounty is not for sale.
- The rest are a dollar each.
- A dollar each?
How do those short-legged chickens lay eggs so high?
Levity in the young is like unto a dry gourd with the seeds rattling around.
My daughter, Elsa.
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.
- Go start supper.
- And change that dress.
- Change it? What for?
For the good reason I told you to.
Did you hear what I said?
- I think it's a real pretty dress.
- Thank you.
Put your horses in the corral yonder.
Supper will be ready in an hour.
No charge. The Lord's bounty...
- Is not for sale.
- Thank you, sir.
Think of all that going to waste up here.
Like the fellow said, gold is where you find it.
And if it's not yours, don't covet it.
Don't worry.
The Lord's bounty may not be for sale...
...but the devil's is, if you can pay the price.
There's a lot of truth in those words, Heck.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Supper's ready.
Gentlemen.
Heavenly Father, we thank thee for the food on this table.
Teach thy children to be grateful for thy goodness...
...to walk in thy path...
...that they may not suffer thy wrath and thy vengeance.
Bless us, O Lord, and these our guests...
...and forgive them the mercenary desires which brought them here.
Amen.
Thanks for entering a plea on our behalf, but what's this about mercenary desires?
You're on your way to Coarsegold. Them that travel there do so for one reason.
To traffic in gold.
Which to possess is to live in fear, to desire, to live in sorrow.
But we're not trafficking, sir.
Merely transporting.
It says in the Book, Gold is a stumbling block to them that sacrifice to it...
...and every fool shall be taken therewith.
A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.
A loving favor rather than silver and gold.
Proverbs, chapter 22.
Into the land of trouble and anguish come the old lions...
...and they shall carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses...
...to a people that shall not profit them.
Isaiah, chapter 30, verse six.
That mining town is a sinkhole of depravity.
A place of shame and sin.
According to Father, every place outside this farm is a place of sin.
- That'll do.
- You don't have to preach at everybody.
That will do.
You cook a lovely ham hock,
Miss Knudsen. Just lovely.
Appetite, chapter one.
Give me a towel, and I'll dry.
Thanks just the same. You hadn't better.
It must be pretty lonely living up here.
Sometimes I think there's nobody left in the world but my father and me.
It's a crime. A girl like you being stuck up on this old stump ranch.
A girl like you ought to be living in the city.
San Francisco, say.
- You've been there?
- Plenty of times.
I never been anywhere.
He won't even take me to town when he goes after supplies.
He says the men would stare at me.
Suppose on the way back,
I was to pick you up...
...and take you to San Francisco...
...or Denver.
- Chicago, even.
- Elsa, who you talking to in there?
To myself. You'd better go.
- I'll meet you outside.
- I can't.
I'll wait for you by the corral.
That boy you trained personally shows a substantial lack of judgment.
Showing your age, aren't you?
Interfering with a young man's love life?
Well, I'm not paying him $ 10 a day to go mooning after some girl...
...whose old man's about to hind-end him with a load of buckshot.
- Know who she reminds me of, Steve?
- No.
Sara Truesdale.
There's no resemblance at all.
Oh, maybe not in the features, but the way she smiles.
There's the same look in her eyes when you talk to her.
The kind of look that makes you feel you've said something real important.
You and Sara always looked so right together.
I can't say I blamed her for not marrying you.
Forgetting the lousy money we made, what woman wants to sit around...
...waiting for her husband to be brought home with his head shot off?
I wonder if I can get these fixed in Coarsegold.
I guess losing Sara is what you might call a hazard of our profession.
That rancher she married...
Stacey, is it?
He's doing fine up in Idaho.
Got a big ranch there.
Raises blooded horses.
- And children too, I hear.
- Grandchildren now.
Three of them.
That right, Steve?
Yep, that's right.
Three grandchildren.
Think she's happy, Steve?
If my sleeping bothers you, don't you bother to let me know.
Sorry.
Evening.
- You surely took your time.
- I shouldn't be here at all.
Well, why? Does the night air bother you?
If it does, come on up in the hay.
I love the night air.
The thing is, I'm what you might call engaged.
- Sure you are.
- It's the truth.
His name is Billy Hammond.
He asked me to marry him.
Several times.
I said I thought I probably would.
You'll see him in Coarsegold. He's a miner at the strike, doing real well.
Well, if he's in Coarsegold...
...and you're here...
...I don't see any harm in talking.
You! Get in the barn and stay there!
And you, go to the house.
The mouth of a strange woman is a deep pit...
...and him that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein.
- Won't you never learn any decency?
- We were only gonna talk. Talk.
- The likes of him don't stop at talking.
- The likes of him.
Every man I meet becomes "the likes of him."
- He's no good. I see it in his face.
- That's all you see.
Billy Hammond came here twice.
You said he was evil.
I'm your father.
I've got to keep the dirt away.
- Protect you from the wrong kind of men.
- That's everyone.
Every single man is the wrong kind of man. Except you.
I promised the next time you hit me, you'd be sorry for it.
For my mouth shall speak truth...
...and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness.
Elsa, I'm sorry.
Receive my instruction and not silver...
...and knowledge rather than choice gold.
For wisdom is better than rubies.
In about 30 years, you'll like the feel of it too.
Pick that up. These mountains don't need your trash.
Dandy pair of boots you got here.
Juan Fernandez made those boots for me in San Antone. Special order.
I had a hell of a time getting him to put that hole in there.
A fine craftsman, but he never did understand the principle of ventilation.
I remember Juan. Always felt the boot should cover the foot.
Short-sighted.
Remember Doc Franklin, the fancy boots he wore with the flaps over the toes?
Had them made in Boston.
- Old Doc. Know what happened to him?
- I heard he died.
That's right. Old Doc.
Gave 30 years of his life to make the West safe for decent people.
You'd have wept to see the way they turned out to pay tribute. Three of them.
The mortician, the gravedigger and me.
Well, when I'm buried, I won't much care who comes to the funeral.
I was commenting on the fairest flower that grows within the human heart:
Gratitude.
The only gratitude I expect is my paycheck. Twenty dollars' worth.
- That satisfies you?
- Well, I guess that's all I can hope for.
Is it?
According to my contract, it is.
Come on, let's get moving.
- He don't know what you're talking about.
- He will, in time.
When we're ready, let's bend a gun over his head and take the gold.
You couldn't get close enough to Steve Judd to saddle his horse.
Well, you could.
Yes, I could, but I won't.
Unless I have to.
I hope heaven forgives us for earning this easy money.
I seem to remember a man hankering for some old-time activity.
I'd like to see some old-time mountains.
As I recall, they sure were a lot easier to get around in.
You sure complain a lot in your old age.
Well, I got something to complain about.
You're earning twice the money for taking the same risk.
Plus possessing all the other rewards you've gathered...
...during your years of loyal service.
A bluegrass thoroughbred, silver-mounted saddle...
...magnificent wardrobe. I'm envious.
What more could a man expect?
What more can a man hope for?
You forgot to mention my two-dollar watch.
Waste of breath.
What else could a man expect?
I got to thinking about that one time.
I keep records. When I became a lawman, the world lost a first-class bookkeeper.
So to pass the time one day, I calculated what it was worth getting shot at.
I figured it at about $ 100 a shot.
You'd have earned quite a sum by now.
Getting hit, I figure that's worth anywhere from 1000 on up.
- That's 3000 I know you got coming.
- Four brings it up to date.
And when you tally up all those fights and bushwhackings and cold camps...
...that time in Lincoln County, five weeks in the hospital...
...six months out of work.
You add them all up, and I'd figure...
...I was owed about all the gold we could carry out of these mountains.
That's something to dream about.
It sure is.
Heck!
- Mind if I keep you company on the trip?
- I don't mind.
- I do.
- I'll second that.
My advice is turn the horse around and ride back where you belong.
I'm not going back to my father. I'm going to Coarsegold to marry Billy Hammond.
Why do you wanna do a foolish thing like that?
That's my affair.
She's right, Heck. Our business is transporting gold, not girls.
Thanks for paying back our hospitality.
Those ham hocks and everything.
I'm a strong believer in love and gratitude...
...but not strong enough to bring you under these conditions.
I'll ride by myself.
We can make three miles before it gets dark.
Right. Got to cover ground.
- Got a gun?
- No, I don't have a gun.
Too bad. This is certain mountain-lion country.
It sure is.
Well, build a good fire.
It will scare them off.
You both go on ahead.
I couldn't sleep tonight with the thought of Elsa by herself.
I'll stay with her and meet you in Coarsegold. Go on ahead.
Those mountain lions, some don't scare so easy.
Come along, girl.
- Do you remember old man Teaford?
- Oh, yeah.
All night, Logan.
Way up, Logan.
You know, the way you do your hair looks real nice.
You think so?
Pa had me cut it short.
It sort of fits the shape of your head, when you see it from the side.
Yeah. Like that.
You know, most girls don't know the first thing about their hair.
I guess you're an authority on what most girls do.
Well, I've studied the subject.
Not just what they do, but why.
Now, you take this getting married.
Do you think that's such a good idea?
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
My guess is, you're doing it to get away from your pa. To get even, maybe.
I guess your guess is as good as anybody's.
Well, if it's wrong, how come you ran away?
Because my father doesn't want me to get married.
Always says he does.
If I can find a decent young man.
But nobody's decent, according to him.
You included.
He said you were no good.
He said the likes of you don't stop at talking.
You know, he has a point there.
Don't move!
Don't move, Elsa.
No! Heck, no! Let me go! No! No!
Let me go!
My, oh, my.
When I questioned you about him...
...I should've gone more into the subject of character.
I hope that's a mistake
I won't live to regret.
Good fight. I enjoyed it.
That old man?
That old man is about half rough.
- You learned a lesson, didn't you?
- I surely did.
Got room for another?
Let her fly.
We're not here for romance.
Understand me, son?
Yes, sir.
I hope Mr. Judd didn't hurt you too bad.
- I guess it's kind of my fault.
- What do you mean, "kind of"?
I acted silly. I'm sorry.
I do like you, Heck.
Save the sugar talk for your Billy boy.
I don't need it.
What you need's the kind of girl who'd go with you to San Francisco or Denver.
And there's plenty of them.
I changed my mind.
You got just what you deserve!
You got something to say?
No, I think she about covered everything.
Lovely place. A beauty spot of nature.
A Garden of Eden for the sore in heart and short of cash.
We didn't come here to enjoy the scenery.
The High Sierra Crochet and Garden Society...
...seem to be having their weekly meeting.
When we get located, pass the word that we're in camp and ready for business.
And you, find out where the Hammond claim is and take her there.
Why me?
Because Steve and I are gonna be busy collecting gold.
Not too late to change your mind.
I came to Coarsegold to be married.
And that's what I'm gonna be. Married.
- Well, good luck, then.
- All the happiness in the world.
Welcome to Coarsegold.
This seems to be the place to find it.
You might be in for a big surprise.
How do you know Billy boy still wants to marry you?
- What do you care?
- I don't.
This the Hammond claim?
- Who wants to know?
- I do. I'm looking for Billy Hammond.
You found him.
Billy!
Howdy, Elsa!
I can't believe it, honey.
Looks like the girl he's been going down the mountain to see.
I'll say one thing, she's sure worth the trip.
Wish I'd got there first.
Looks like a warm one.
- Hey, where's your pa at?
- Back home.
You mean you run off and come all the way up here just to see me?
See you?
I brought my mother's wedding dress.
- If you still want to.
- If I want to?
If he don't, you got four others to choose from.
Sweet thing like you ought to have the pick of the litter.
- No rush about making up your mind.
- Don't listen.
We're gonna get married tonight.
I guess that will be all, Mr. Longtree.
By the way...
...just who is Mr. Longtree?
I rode up with him from the farm.
- That's a couple of days on the trail.
- That's right. Two days, two nights.
A couple of nights.
A couple of nights on the trail.
Billy!
There were two other men with us from the bank in town.
Besides, Mr. Longtree was a perfect gentleman.
How come? Something wrong with him?
Well, now, I don't think I ever met a perfect gentleman before, Mr. Longtree.
You come back and see us real soon now, you hear, Mr. Longtree?
Jimmy, Sylvus, Elder, come on down here. I want you to meet my woman.
Come on.
Elsa, honey, this is Jimmy.
He's the baby of the family.
And that's Sylvus. He's been doing our cooking, as you can see.
And the one on the end is Elder.
He's the head of the clan.
I want you to meet my favorite brother.
Henry! Get down here now! Come on.
Henry's sort of our banker, you might say.
Come on, honey, I'll show you my tent.
It looks like you've got a pretty good claim.
It's a gold mine. Why don't you come over and take a look.
You're invited too.
- Find Billy Hammond?
- Yeah.
What's he like?
What difference does it make?
She wanted him, now she's got him.
I don't want a shave.
Well, Jimmy, you're gonna get shaved whether you want to or not.
You've been running around with that peach fuzz long enough.
We want that girl to know she's marrying into a family of men.
Hey, Billy.
Thank you, Sylvus.
Now haul it.
What's that for?
You're leaving.
I see no sense in moving out just because you're honeymooning.
I don't have time to explain it to you, brother. Just get out.
I ain't going.
You just did.
Takes care of him.
- I gotta clean up in here.
- Plenty of time for that later.
- No. I wanna do it now.
- No, you don't.
- But the place is filthy.
- It'll wait. It'll wait.
Let go, Billy.
- Billy, let me go!
- All right.
Calm down.
Come on, honey.
See you later.
If you need any help...
...fastening up your wedding dress, you just holler, you hear?
I'll manage.
First drink is best, east or west.
- Let him go. Turn him loose.
- There we go.
Jimmy, we're gonna make a man of you now.
Say, Henry.
I've been wanting to ask you something.
Something's been on my mind.
Was you planning to bathe for the wedding?
No, sir.
You ain't gonna clean up for your brother's wedding?
No, sir, I ain't.
I didn't wash when cousin got wed back home.
That bride didn't seem to mind none.
Did she, Billy?
Now there'll be none of that.
None of what?
You know something, Sylvus?
Billy is getting small-minded about that woman.
And a might feisty.
A few drinks under his belt, he'll change his mind.
Now, liquor always did have a softening effect on Billy.
I hate to get married with one of my brothers...
...smelling bad enough to gag a dog.
Yeah, that so?
You wouldn't want that sweet thing to think we're less than quality, would you?
The only thing I know is that after tonight...
...she ain't gonna be able to think enough about me.
Get him in there.
All right, let him up.
- Henry. Henry.
- Henry.
- Come on now, Henry.
- Easy now.
- We're just funning you, Henry.
- Come on, Henry.
- Easy.
- Come on, Henry.
Put the knife up now.
You're gonna cut yourself.
Is that a smile I see on his face?
Easy now, Henry.
Come on, boys.
Drink to the bride!
Let's have a drink.
Stand up, judge. Here comes the bride.
Come on. Steady now.
Here she is, folks, my bride-to-be.
Elsa, this here's Judge Tolliver.
Pleased to make your acquaintance, my dear.
And that there's Kate.
She's your bridesmaid.
Welcome to Kate's Place, honey.
And these ladies over here are Sam and Rose and Belle and Candy.
- We're your flower girls, honey.
- You're beautiful, girls. Beautiful.
Aren't they beautiful, Elsa?
Let her roll, Charlie!
Drinks on the house!
You come on over and sit down, honey.
You must be tired. Poor baby.
We'll all of us have a little drinkie before the formalities.
Now, you take this. Don't be afraid.
It'll do you good.
Cheers, Elsa.
Heck.
Eleven thousand, four hundred and eighty-six.
That's a far cry from a quarter of a million.
Fortunes of war.
Hardly worth it.
All depends on where you stand.
I guess that's right.
To a poor man, 11,000 is just as far away as 250,000.
- Where are you going?
- Out for some fresh air. Any objections?
We're gathered here in the high mountains in the presence of this august company...
...to join this man and this woman in matrimony.
Now, I'm not a man of the cloth, and this is not a religious ceremony.
It's a civil marriage.
But it's not to be entered into unadvisedly...
...but reverently and soberly.
A good marriage has a kind of simple glory about it.
A good marriage is like a rare animal.
It's hard to find.
It's almost impossible to keep.
You see, people change.
That's important for you to know at the beginning.
People change.
The glory of a good marriage don't come at the beginning.
It comes later on.
It's hard work.
Billy, do you take this woman to be your lawful-wedded wife...
...until God, by death, shall separate you?
- I do.
And do...?
What's your name again?
Elsa Knudsen.
Do you, Elsa, promise to take this man to be your lawful-wedded husband...
...until death does separate you?
I do.
Do you have a ring?
Then, by the authority vested in me,
I hereby pronounce you man and wife.
All right, girls, change your clothes.
Henry! Henry, Henry!
No, no. Sylvus, Sylvus.
Now that's enough, Sylvus.
Hey, bartender, pour a little more.
No use standing here tormenting yourself, son.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
What a party!
Come on, Billy. Come on, get over there and get acquainted around.
Let me in there. Let me in there.
- Have fun, honey.
- Billy!
Billy!
Come on, now. It's my turn, Sylvus.
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, wait.
You had your turn.
It looks like Jimmy's making a man out of himself.
- I told you not to do that!
- Now, don't be like that, Sylvus.
Oh, come on now.
Now, Sylvus, we got a nice party.
Why don't you behave yourself.
You can't hit my brother!
Don't leave me.
I wish I'd known more about those brothers.
It's too late now.
- She's married.
- Glad they didn't invite me.
I always cry at weddings.
The more I am around you, the more
I can do without your sense of humor.
Come on, break it up!
Boys, get over there!
Now I said, break it up, and I mean it. Get over there.
Come on, Sylvus, get over here and behave yourself.
Get over there!
- No, Billy.
- Come on.
No.
Well, now, get on in there!
Easy now, Elsa.
- Listen, Elsa, you come here!
- No, Billy!
No, Billy! No! Not here!
No, Billy!
Now, you straighten out, you hear me?
Where's Billy?
I've got some prying brothers.
You stay here.
She's mine. She's mine. Let go, Henry.
- Elsa!
- Henry, turn loose of me!
I'm gonna get you.
- Come back, Elsa. Come back.
- Come back, girl.
Come on, get your bride.
Billy, get your bride.
Hold it!
Let her go.
- Where are you going with my wife?
- She'll stay with us.
- I'm taking her to her father tomorrow.
- Like hell she will.
- You can't take a wife from her husband.
- Clear case of breaking and entering.
- Elsa's legally married to Billy. Right?
- I now pronounce you man and wife.
- And don't you forget it.
- Go along, Elsa.
Heck.
You're not leaving this camp with her.
I'll promise you that.
Go home, Billy.
What happened? You all right, Billy?
Where is she? Where is she?
I'll kill him. I'll kill him.
- Billy!
- Where'd he go with her?
- Come on.
- Why'd you let him get away with her?
The marriage didn't work.
We have to take her to her father.
- We've got our hands full already.
- I don't like it any better than you do.
Too big, huh?
What are they doing there?
We're willing to abide by the court's decision if you are.
We'll abide.
Don't be scared.
- What's wrong?
- Billy Hammond wants Elsa.
They appointed a miners' court to decide it.
- Miners' court?
- That's the law, places like this.
- Who says?
- They do.
And there's a lot more of them than there are of us.
Billy's very sorry. Swears it won't happen again. I believe him.
- I wouldn't believe Billy...
- I don't wanna go back.
You were legally married of your own free will.
Please. You can't let him take me back. You can't.
But whatever they decide, that will have to be it.
That don't have to be it. She's not going with him. She stays with us.
She stays here!
We're packing gold, not petticoats.
If she stays, I stay.
Well, let's hope the court lets her go with us.
Otherwise, we'll be a little short-handed.
All right, gentlemen, we can proceed.
In the first place, I married this gal here last night, up on the hill in Kate's Place.
- You saw Judge...
- Where can I find Judge Tolliver?
- At the end of the hall, mister.
- He married us legal and proper.
Easy. Sit up.
A little more.
Thank you, sir.
What can I do for you?
Clear up a little technicality, if you will.
About that marriage last night.
They're holding a miners' court.
They'll wanna know if it was legal.
- Of course it was legal.
- Well, I believe that.
But the court may want proof, in the form of a license.
You got one?
Signed by the governor of California.
Yes, sir, there's no question at all about the legality of this document.
Now, when you testify before that miners' court...
...I'm gonna ask you one question:
"Do you possess a license to marry people in California?"
And you're gonna answer, "No."
Am I clear?
- That's a lie.
- No, it isn't. You don't possess it. I do.
- Now, see here...
- Listen to me!
You're gonna do as you're told.
Understand?
Now, do you recall the question
I'm gonna ask?
And what do you answer?
No.
Very good.
Let's go.
According to the law, she's still married to Billy Hammond.
You and the law.
She can get it nullified.
Will that satisfy your ironbound code of ethics?
My code satisfies pretty easy, partner.
Would it surprise you to know that I was once a lawbreaker?
Well, bless my stars.
About the age of that boy back there.
Skinny as a snake and just about as mean.
Ran with the Hole-in-the-Wall bunch.
Gun-happy, looking for trouble or a pretty ankle.
Had the world by the tail, so to speak.
Then one night,
Paul Staniford picked me up.
He was sheriff of Madera County then.
There'd been a fight, and I was drunk.
Sicker than a fat dog.
He dried me out in jail, and then we went out back...
...and he proceeded to kick the bitter hell right out of me.
That took some doing.
Not much. You see, he was right, I was wrong.
That makes the difference.
Who says so?
Nobody. That's something you just know.
Anyhow, when I was able to walk again,
I realized I'd learned a lesson from him.
The value of self-respect.
What's that worth on the open market?
Nothing to some people, but a great deal to me.
But I lost it.
These last years, the only work
I was able to get was places like Kate's.
Bartender, stick man, bouncer, what have you.
Not much to brag on.
Now I'm getting back a little respect for myself.
I intend to keep it with the help of you and that boy back there.
- Good to be working again, Gil.
- Yeah.
You know what's on the back of a poor man when he dies?
The clothes of pride.
And they're not a bit warmer to him dead than they were when he was alive.
Is that all you want, Steve?
All I want is to enter my house justified.
Thank you.
Will you stay in town when we get back?
I'm not just certain. Why?
You're right, kid. I've been wasting my breath. Tonight we move.
- I don't know.
- You don't know what?
I started out thinking he was an old mossback...
...but I changed my mind.
Kind of hate to turn against him.
Are you with me or not?
- What will happen to Elsa?
- He'll deliver her.
The thing for you to remember is that we made a deal.
Yes, sir.
It all pointed this way.
All that talk about old Doc Franklin, ungrateful citizens.
- What we had coming but never got paid.
- It's the truth, isn't it, Steve?
I knew in my bones what you were aiming for, but I wouldn't believe it.
I kept telling myself you were a good man.
- You were my friend.
- This is bank money, not yours.
And what they don't know won't hurt them.
Not them. Only me!
Take off your gun belt and toss it over here.
What are you gonna do?
You always fancied yourself faster than me.
Go ahead, draw.
Draw, you damned tinhorn!
That was your second mistake...
...and the last chance you'll ever get from me.
I'm gonna put you behind bars, Gil.
You'll play hell getting it done.
Move!
My, oh, my, will you look who's here.
Howdy. You made pure fools out of us, stealing that license from Tolliver.
The judge says there's another one on file in Sacramento.
That means she's still my wife.
Come on, honey, let's go home.
She stays with us.
Looks to me like you been having some trouble.
Looks to me like somebody got their finger caught in the cookie jar.
You're short-handed, old-timer, but she's all we want.
All we want, provided we get her now.
- You heard me.
- We'll get her, sooner or later.
Like hell you will!
You better cut yourself a switch,
Mr. Longtree.
I don't think you could handle me barehanded.
You all are gonna get yourself a chance to try, directly.
Come on.
I have your word you'll return your gun when this is over?
Yes, sir, I reckon you do.
- I'll go along.
- You bet you'll go along.
- We're moving into the rocks.
- Steve!
Shut up! Move!
Move out!
You're really showing your age.
Back in the old days, you'd have checked those rifles before we left camp.
I'll get around behind them.
Don't waste your time.
They're too far away.
He's going around behind us.
Cut me loose and give me a gun.
I'll get a rifle for you.
Start shooting.
Sylvus!
Sylvus!
- He was carrying a rifle.
- Let's get out of here!
- Looks like they got Sylvus.
- I know that. Come on! We're getting out.
You got two brothers dead, you talk about running?
Come on!
I wonder where those other three went.
- I hope they're not still following us.
- Calm your fears, honey.
My guess is, they gave up and went back to Coarsegold.
Assuming that's so,
I'll have your gun back.
Do you hear me, boy?
I'm sorry, Mr. Judd.
I guess I was showing off.
- What happens when we get to town?
- It's up to the sheriff.
He's turning us in.
You know that. So do I.
- Ever hear of Folsom Prison, Heck?
- No.
Well, it's solid rock.
During the years we spend there we'll discuss...
...the events of the past few minutes at great length.
And by the time you get out, you won't like him any better than I do now...
...which isn't one hell of a lot.
Where do I sleep?
Up there. I don't wanna see you till breakfast.
Cut me loose, Steve.
Why?
Because I don't sleep so good anymore.
- Good night.
- Good night.
My father says there's only right and wrong...
...good and evil.
Nothing in between.
- It isn't that simple, is it?
- No, it isn't. It should be, but it isn't.
What's gonna happen to him?
The boy? I'll testify for him.
They shouldn't be too hard.
Will you testify for Mr. Westrum?
- No, I won't.
- Why?
Because he was my friend.
- How come he don't tie us up?
- What for?
No place to go.
He's got the horses, and he's got the guns.
And it wouldn't take long for Steve Judd to find us.
Wait a minute, kid.
I just had a thought.
Well, keep it to yourself.
I'm fed up with you and your ideas.
That's all right.
That's all right.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Where's Gil?
- Gone.
Why didn't you go with him?
Because I didn't see any future in our partnership.
Come on.
Get up there!
You wait here.
I'll go down and take a look around.
- The old gent's taking quite a chance.
- I don't think so.
Neither does he.
I never figured it would turn out this way.
Chances are I'll be locked up for a while.
I've got no call to bring it up.
- But maybe when I get out...
- I'll be there.
I saw your father. Everything's all right.
What are you doing?
- That's strange.
- What?
He goes to her grave every day but always in the morning.
Never in the afternoon.
We're going to the ditch.
Now!
I walked right into it.
I'm gonna try for the corral.
I got him.
Well, where's the rifle?
On the horse.
Bad?
Not yet.
Partner, what do you think?
Let's meet them head-on, halfway, just like always.
My sentiments exactly.
- You, Hammonds!
- What do you want, old man?
He wants a shovel and six feet of dirt.
You redneck peckerwoods.
You're too chicken-gutted to finish this thing out in the open.
Two old men against all three of you boys.
And if them odds ain't enough for you damned dry-gulching Southern trash...
...we'll send out the girl.
- We're coming!
- You hear me, Henry?
- Yeah, I hear you.
You don't have to ask me twice!
Now, you hold on, Billy.
- We'll catch them when they raise up.
- Ain't you got no sense of family honor?
Start the ball, old man.
How'd we figure?
- A thousand dollars a shot?
- Yeah.
Those boys sure made me a lot of money.
They put them all in one spot.
I don't want them to see this.
I'll go it alone.
Don't worry about anything.
I'll take care of it, just like you would have.
Hell, I know that.
I always did.
You just forgot it for a while, that's all.
So long, partner.
I'll see you later.

"Let me bleed this ape."
But Lampiao answered him :
"Not him, he's a man of honor."
"He's an enemy, but he's loyal."
Dr Mattos,
Lampiao was my mirror.
The next morning,
I was already hunting him.
One day, in the middle of a road and in the middle of a gunfight,
Lampiao would yell at me :
"Antonio, Is it you Antonio ?"
When Corisco did recognize me, he became mad.
He jumped and shot... and the wind shook his hair... which floated like gold flags.
Then, I killed him and everything was over.
And now you tell me, that there's still cangaceiros...
I can't believe you.
I agree to do what you ask me to.
But I don't want money.
I'll go to the Garden of the Piranhas, to see if it's true... that they still exist.
Madalena, ready my old trunk, put in my rifle and my hat.
I'm traveling.
Cursed by ten churches
Rejected by all saints
Antonio das Mortes
Killer of the Cangaceiros
Bring him on, Batista.
Bring him on!
It's him, Laura.
Coronel, here's Antonio das Mortes.
He came to watch over the cangaceiros...
I asked you for police reinforcements.
Antonio is better.
If he kills, there will be no investigation, nor questioning, nor press article.
And he doesn't want money.
Mattos, a free mercenary brings bad luck.
Furthermore, it's useless.
Some say that this cangaceiro is nothing but theater.
Maybe, coronel, but a "nothing" could spoil the future of the Garden of the Piranhas.
I want to install industry.
Investors from the south will require order.
We must end the violence.
The agrarian reform will resolve the struggles.
What ? Agrarian reform ?
Yes, coronel,
Agrarian reform.
This is the progress, sign of the times.
Me, to share my lands ?
Did you become crazy ?
To share my lands, with these work-shies ?
Is the government mad ?
It is not its task to care about the things of the land.
It's mine.
It has to care about machines.
The land, it's my business.
Don't talk to me about american help, agrarian reform or industry and other lies.
I only know my cows.
Something else.
I don't fear no misfortune.
And I don't need Antonio das Mortes.
I only want Laura.
Laura, my love, come near me.
Agrarian reform... To share my lands with these work-shies...
They'll have to fight too.
I don't share my sweat.
They'll have to kill me to take over my lands.
The elder is becoming mad.
Go set your stuff down, and wait for my orders.
Laura, you'll always be by my side.
To share my lands with these work-shies ?!
Batista,
If Dr Getulio Varg still lived, nobody would dare to take over our lands.
The guilty about all of that...
Atomic bomb...
There's beautifull women in town.
You should meet them.
To do what ?
You already have one in the neighborhood.
It's not me who says that.
The people are talking, commissar.
Vox populi, vox dei.
Did you learn latin from the priest ?
By the way, the priest wants me to become the prefect.
What a frightening challenger for me !
What's your political platform ?
The pulpit !
Will you become a sexton ?
I don't have any access to the bed, or the dinner table of a coronel.
I'm going to be prefect, then deputy.
And then, senator.
I'll find you a good job, with a regular salary.
Good. I wasn't paid for the last six months.
No pessimism.
A great economic cycle begins.
I only know the cycle of cocoa.
The cycle of coffee, of gold, the one of diamond...
The cycle of sugar, of petrol and of the rubber.
The dollar is the savior of this country.
Will it save the country, or its receiver ?
I loved, I loved too much.
I suffered from love like nobody else
I've cried, and I've lost peace
I know that nobody never ever...
The 'cachaça', you pay it !
My Saint...
The time has come. The time to burn the living ones and to destroy the town.
I have to fulfill my vow.
For the angels' happiness, and the people's happiness.
Show respect to God, Captain Coirana.
Respect god and the government.
To respect ?
And who shows respect to us ?
Us, poor wandering unhappy ones ?
Only vengeance shall permit us to forget the years of suffering.
Without respect.
Absolutly no respect.
It has been proved in the past, and it will be proved in the future : the one who fights against the government shall pay with his own head.
The unhappy cries.
The destiny of poverty is hell.
I want to embark again on my whithe ship... and sail back to Africa.
My Grandfather's Africa.
Negro Antao, you are bathing in fear.
You are at the limits of ignorance.
Future lies beyond future.
Not before past.
I've traveled around the world
I've seen the misfortunes of other peoples.
I've learned this Truth from The Holy Book :
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
In 1945,
When Brazil entered the war in the Far Europe, it was the dictature of Vargas.
Did Brazil win this war ?
Didn't it ?
For myself, I've lost them all.
By fear and cowardise.
I've even lost the sight of my enemy.
Professor...
Do you see this hand ?
This hand killed many cangaceiros...
And now, I'm alone...
In the loneliness of memories.
I have to find another enemy.
To give a meaning to my life.
I want to see, if Coirana really is a cangaceiro.
If he exists, professor,
I have to kill him.
My heart
What is the reason for
You to beat so quickly
When he sees you
And my eyes start to laugh
They hunt you, on the street
However
You run away
If only you'd know how sweet I am
And how much I want you
If you knew how much I'm sincere, you would stay by my side
Come
Come feel the warm
Of my lips
They're seeking yours
Come to quench this passion which is devouring my heart
Then only
I'll know happiness
The great happiness
"They are more than thousands in debt to me.
"But if I enumerate them all,
The earth will shake.
"I'm claiming for the debts in the
Lampiao's testament.
"A man has to become a woman,
A woman has to ask for mercy.
"Freedom for the prisoner, prison for the jailer.
"A white veil for the whore who will marry at the Church.
"Money for my poverty, and something to eat for my people
"Honor my revendications, or I'll come back."
Are you of flesh ? Are you of shadows ?
Anwer that, cursed cangaceiro !
I don't believe in your ridiculous clothing.
"First, tell me your name, then wear off your disguise."
"Who talk like this is already condemned."
Open your ears.
I am Antonio das Mortes.
Here to frighten your cowardise, and to override your destiny.
And I add, not on brazilian territory, nor in heaven, nor in hell : there is no place for a new cangaceiro !
Be ready, my people !
And look at the duel between the dragon of cruelty and the holy warrior.
From Corisco to Lampiao, no more soul-in-sorrow in hell.
Be ready !
I'm going to end up with your race,
Antonio das Mortes.
Come, I'm waiting,
Antonio das Mortes !
The Piranhas took me !
The Piranhas are devouring me !
Mattos, put an end to these chants !
Put an end to these chants !
I am coronel Horacio,
I order you to stop singing !
Batista, make them stop !
Put an end to that devil chant !
They have to stop,
I'm ordering it !
Laura, put an end to these chants !
They have to stop,
It's an order !
Coronel Horacio is ordering these chants to be ceased !
I'm like a father to you,
The Garden of the Piranhas is poor,
Look at me, my clothes, my home...
The government is making fun of me, by promising food, money for the poors, drugs, a doctor...
But nothing comes.
My hands are tied,
I can't nourish all of you. 
I'm not the Christ.
I'm a good man,
But I can't do miracles.
Did you hear me ?
Go away, all of you !
Wait, I'll do you charity.
Batista, open the store and give them some flour and meat.
Remember, it's charity.
Mattos, that's a charitable act,
I'm going to nourish every one,
Batista, open the store and nourish them,
Say to everyone, that i'm a good and charitable man,
Flour and meat,
Antonio Conselheiro,
Saint Lourenço called "Cauldron ",
Saint Sebastiao called "the Good-looking",
Lampiao,
Antonio Silvino, cangaceiro and poet,
All from Juazeiro.
Many became mad trying to change this sertao.
You can't change the creation of God.
This cangaceiro...
Why didn't Antonio das Mortes exterminate this race.
I'm more confident in Mata Vaca,
Professor...
Did you look at this woman, this saint ?
You already found a cangaceiro.
And now a saint ?
What do you want to do with a saint ?
She remembers me of a young girl from Pernambouco.
She had slept with the coronel's son, and got pregnant.
Then, she sold herself to prostitution.
At the Sao Francisco bay.
She became tuberculous, then throw herself in the river.
She was devoured by piranhas.
Not even a bone was left.
Requiescat in pace,
Antonio das Mortes.
Antonio das Mortes, here, before me...
I saw you, black bird.
Falcon, vulture...
Corisco, I'll avenge you.
My brothers, I'll avenge you all.
Captain Lampiao, you were the governor of this sertao,
I'll avenge you !
Antonio.
We should bring him to the moutains.
If he dies here, they'll come back.
I don't want another slaughter, nor blood.
Captain Lampiao, Corisco...
The Piranhas are devouring me.
But I'm gonna kill them.
Captain Lampiao, you'll be avenged.
I'll avenge Corisco...
I'll avenge all of you.
I'm gonna kill them.
Antonio das Mortes, I'm gonna kill you.
One day, an endless war will start.
Where did you hear that ?
From the mouth of God.
You, don't use the name of God.
My parents, my grandparents, they were all saints.
And they all died by your hands.
They did join the cangaço.
And died by your hands.
Today, this people will die by your hands, too.
If Coirana dies, the people will die of thirst and hunger.
My Saint,
I've seen many churches, but not one patron saint.
I swear I've came here only for the sake of finding if a cangaceiro was still alive.
I was sure that Corisco was the last one.
But I don't want to kill anymore.
If I killed your parents, your grandparents, your brothers...
May you forgive me, my Saint.
The one who murders will be thrown in the deeps of the sea.
Go away, Antonio.
And on every roads of fire on the world
Ask for forgiveness for your crimes.
Look, Antonio das Mortes
Look at the marks of torture.
I leaved on a rotten truck.
Hoping to find wealth.
Here at the Minas Gerais,
I became a slave.
I was employed
In the forests of the Mato Grosso.
Only the strongs survived.
The weak ones were sold.
Then came the time of revolt and regrets.
I went back on the way to Bahia.
When I reached Juazeiro, I saw...
When I reached Juazeiro, I saw... an old man, who wanted to sell his daughter for 5000 coins.
I took the girl, and ran away to the sertao, to the borders of Alagoas when I reached,
I've seen them both, and I said :
Here are the angels of poverty.
I unearthed my grandmother's clothes
And gave them to her.
Him, I've named him Coirana,
The venimous snake.
We leaved to wander on the roads,
Together and happy.
The one who murders will be thrown in the deeps of the sea.
Go away, Antonio.
And on every road of fire on this world, ask for forgiveness for your crimes.
The dragon of cruelty, it's you, Antonio.
Everyone in the sertao knows that under your cape, you're wearing a gold shirt which protects you from bullets.
The gold the wealthies gave you to murder the poors.
Are you fine, Antonio ?
Father...
I have to talk to Dr Mattos.
For the love of God,
Tell him to come here.
You'll never be the equal of my husband until you have the courage to kill him.
Horacio is more a man than you.
He turned everyone into slaves.
I'm myself in great debt to him.
Did I do wrong when I leaved the brothels of Bahia ?
When he dies, we will inherit everything.
You promised me to get me away from here.
I'll only be able to change my life when he's dead.
Laura, I'm not a murderer.
You're the commissar, and you already killed to follow his orders.
You're only a murderer, a failed murderer.
When you talked about killing Horacio,
I thought you'll do it.
What's best now ?
To kill him, or not to have the courage to do it ?
I have something to ask you.
Ask the coronel to open his store and to give the rest of his food to Coirana's people.
And, commissar, ask him to let these people settle here, to let them work the lands.
I did not bring you here to make such revendications !
Did you think about what I asked you ?
Since I've met these peoples,
I'm starting to feel something in my heart.
And heart has reasons that we can't explain.
The food of the store is only to be sold.
And the lands are owned by the coronel.
God made the world.
The devil made the barbed wires.
If the coronel sinned, he must pay.
I only ask you one thing commissar.
Go to him, and tell him my revendications.
Let us make a deal : find the way to kill the coronel, and i'll do everything you want.
I'll give you more, a small house to die in peace.
You're and educated man, but my ignorance is revolting :
I'll only kill the coronel,
If he rejects my revendications.
- So, why don't you talk to him ?
- It's your hand,
It's your hand that did step in my destiny, you have to go on,
If I've followed a corrupted man,
I'll purificate myself at the root of corruption.
That's what is life,
God wrote the Truths with tortuous lines.
You are an unresponsible, Mattos !
Shut up !
I have many experience with mercenaries.
It was stupid to bring a mercenary here !
Laura, tell him...
I know the people from the sertao !
But the mercenaries, they have to be treated by the whip !
Even Batista saw me talking to him !
Won't you shut up !?
I've talked to him.
Nothing to do about that.
He became mad, he shouted.
He looked like a beast.
He does not understand anything, and doesn't want to.
Antonio, you're my friend,
Aren't you ?
I allowed you to leave your home...
There, you lived hiding and in ignorance.
Don't you want money, Antonio ?
If you want some, I'll give it to you.
Coirana is dead, don't you understand ?
From a loge, I looked at your failures, Mattress
People of the Garden of the Piranhas !
Come to see the judgement of a rare riffraff.
Come to see the protégé of the coronel !
From a loge, I looked at your failures, Mattress
Shut up, wanderer !
You're just a drunkard, and you have to show me respect !
Since a long time,
I was searching for my place.
Now, I've found it.
It's at the side of the Saint.
I understand where is the real enemy.
Who is here ?
God bless you...
Mata Vaca!
A true mercenary from the Minas.
Sit down, my son.
Laura, where are you ?
Mattos, you're a poor wretch!
A traitor, an ill dog !
A miserable dog !
I rise you from the mud,
I promess you the prefecture,
Is this how you thank me ?
By sleeping with my wife ?
You spoiled my happiness, you broke my life !
My friend, Mata Vaca, is here to kill Antonio das Mortes.
But you'll be the first to die !
You were like my own son.
I would have done anything for you.
That's a lie !
Shut up ! Batista saw you !
Batista told me !
Batista is my friend.
Mata Vaca, bring her here !
They'll kiss in front of the all town.
Kiss her !
I can't see, but
I want everybody else to see.
Mata Vaca, make them kiss.
I've lost my eyes in the sertao !
I can't see.
But the town can see !
Make them kiss, Mata Vaca!
May the people see these traitors !
Make them kiss now, Mata Vaca !
It's the truth.
Batista saw you.
Kiss !
I want the whole town to see you.
Batista, what have they done to you ?
You can't die, my friend !
You promised to get me away !
Save me.
I love you, I swear.
Stop, Mata Vaca!
Batista, where are you ?
Where are you, Batista?.
Mata Vaca, where is Batista ?
What did they do to you, my friend ?
Not only traitors, but murderers.
You are the lackey of the coronel, you'll always be his lackey.
Admit it.
You're a coward.
A coward, a coward...
Now, you have to choose.
Die inside, or die outside.
Mattos, take your decision !
Don't worry Horacio.
I'll kill this dog.
Mata Vaca, did you get him ?
You killed him !
Batista, we are avenged.
We are avenged, Batista.
We are avenged.
Then came Corisco and Lampiao with leather hat and a rifle at hand
My Saint...
This cangaceiro is mine.
Let me bury him at the heart of this sertao.
Mata Vaca...
End that act of Justice.
You must put an end to the pestiferous.
Professor ! the coronel did order to kill the saint and her retinue.
And Antonio das Mortes disappeared.
We have to make something !
He ordered to kill them.
The coronel ordered to kill them.
We have to do something !
I can't do anything just by myself.
This one's already dead !
We must care about the living ones!
Care about the living !
Laura, protect me from the devil of obscurity !
Come, Laura.
I dreamed that Antonio das Mortes was killing me.
Come near me, Laura.
Protect me.
Mata Vaca must come !
Antonio das Mortes is going to kill me.
It's destiny, my Saint, that did retain my hand.
I've lost my strength.
I'm not good at anything, anymore.
I'll leave !
Get back to the city !
And it's the same misfortune
I'll find there !
We'll keep bearing the suffering.
Brazil !
And one day an endless war... will start.
Rise from the dust, rise !
Rise from the dust, rise !
I cried, without hiding.
Everyone saw me.
I wasn't the only one to cry.
But rising like I did, who could have done the same ?
A strong man does not stay lying, refusing that a woman could give her hand to him
He recognizes his defeat and don't lose courage.
Rise from the dust, rise !
Rise from the dust, rise !
Hundred of old negros died, they were not working anymore
A bastard named Traz-Ca, turned and fell behind dirty-muzzle and Mustache
- his war name -
Satan's brother-in-law
Here came Lampiao at the gates of hell
A boy, still young, appeared at the gate
Who are you horseman ?
I'm a cangaceiro, answered Lampiao
I'm not your guardian, and not your comrade
You won't enter here, except if you tell your name
Boy, open the door,
I am Lampiao
Terror for the entire world
This guardian, responsible for the gate seeing him like this, didn't ask questions any more
The Negro knows to write, but can't read
Here, forgiveness has no place
Then the guardian came and said : wait for me outside
I'm going to talk with the chief at the central bureau
If he refuses you depending on what he'll say,
I'll accept you, or not
Lampiao said : make your mind, who talks lose time
Go and come back, quick,
I won't wait for long
If they let me enter,
I'll ransack enverything
I'll burn the place and then i'll go away the guardian found Satan at the saloon
Know my Lord that Lampiao is at the door
And pretend to be willing to enter
Should I let him do so ?
No, answered Satan,
Tell him to go away
There's only riffraff coming in,
I'm furious
I'd like to
drive out half of the ones that are already in.
Lampiao is a bandit, a thief of honesty he wants to spread confusion why would we encumber ourselves with such a man without absolute necessity ?
The guardian said :
Lord, what a disaster !
There will be uprising, if we don't let him enter
Don't worry, said Satan, call the negros
Take as many as you need
Hundreds should come, men and women go to the warehouse, and take all the weapons you need
Other fellows of Lucifer should be advised too
The negros came first, came Fuchico armed with an old rifle and shouting to Pea-brain to bring his whip and to call Tangença by Maçarico
Then came Cambota, checking his weapons
Formigueiro, Trupe-Zupe and Quele came then Banzeiro, Pacaia,
Rabisca, Cordao de Saia and finally, Baze
Then came a young she-devil dressed with fine lingerie
She pushed the fence, and said that it was some bad times
And that today would be a hard day
She shouted at the Baiana, that now, it was serious
Then this armed band went to the camp
With rifles, sabers and daggers
There was negress with her cook knife and her manioc rammer
When Lampiao saw this band of armed negros
He said : 
It's only in Abyssinia where we should find such an army
Arms at hands, the chief of this army shouted :
Everyone on him, my negros !
Antonio das Mortes !
Mata Vaca and a handfull of mercenaries are here, ready to pour their own blood to defend their protector.
Listen to me.
I fought against Lampaio, and against Antonio Conselheiro,
But I'm one of them.
Antonio das Mortes !
Show that you're a man.
Let's fight at the front of this church. with this coward crowd, hiding behind windows and under the beds, for witness
Antonio das Mortes !
If God helps a criminal
Then he'll help me :
I've shed less blood than you.
Show that you're a man !
Coronel!
The time has come.
The town will open its eyes.
The one who talks never shed any blood,
But he's ready to shed his own to avenge the humiliated sertao.
And I'd say like the holy Book :
" An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. "
You truly are the angel of the Pest,
The mad beast I was waiting for.
It could not have been Coirana.
It could only be someone like you,
One of these wanderers, who came from the cities to sow the ideas of destruction.
Talk, goon, I'm listening to you.
Professor,
I wanted to say...
We are fighting together, but not with the same weapons. yours are political, mine have to do with God.
Okay, Antonio.
We share the enemy.
You keep all your bravery.
I'll stay in your shadow.
No, professor.
Fight with your ideals, they matter much more than me.
I want to see the famous Mata Vaca !
Coward, son of an ape !
God, let me end my task.
I'm readying myself to show up before You.
The battle was now lasting since more than one hour
Dust was flying everywhere and the negros were crying
Lampiao, even if wounded, would not give away
Lampiao threw a rock at a dog
But the rock blew up the window of the store
A fire started to grow in the cotton reserve
Satan, looking at the fire, called his men back
All the negros came to him
Lampiao went away, having no more enemies
This day was a great loss for Satan
All his wealth burned to dust his record book burned, and all his goods
Lucifer said :
No more horrors, why such a misfortune ?
I'll have the longest winter of my life !
And now I'm going to end up that story with Lampaio
This is not my business, but I give you my point of view
He is not in heaven, nor in hell, but still is in the sertao !
If you don't believe my story
If you do not trust my honesty
You can write in hell and ask to Satan
If this story is true, or not
Cursed by ten chruches
Rejected by all saints
Antonio das Mortes
Killer of cangaceiros...
Little Frank, you take care of your mom.
I will.
- You're not travelling very heavy, Tom.
- I got all I need.
You should be taking the train, Frank.
Fort Smith is too long a ride.
On Judy, 70 miles will be just a pleasant outing.
Yarnell, I know you'll take good care of the place for me.
You and my Mattie.
- Where is Mattie?
- I'm in here, Papa.
Well, little bookkeeper, you got my wherewithal ready?
- Of course.
- How much are you allowing?
There's right around...
...$150 cash money.
You better hand me my good luck gold pieces, too.
Buying Texas mustang ponies, you're gonna need more luck than they put in at the mint.
You'll come around to my plan.
I intend to buy as many ponies as I can swing.
We'll breed them for deer hunting.
I don't think much of Texas ponies.
They're small and chicken-brained.
I'd say small and tough.
Just right for keeping up with dogs through the brush.
- You want my advice, papa?
- I always do.
- Buy the ponies cheap.
- I expect to.
This Colonel Stonehill, he's got to get rid of them before winter sets in.
Papa, that gun's old-fashioned.
Why don't you buy a new one in Fort Smith?
It served me well at Chickamauga.
It's got a long way to go yet.
Goodbye, Papa.
Tom Chaney, now there's trash for you.
He should have stayed here and looked after the place, it's his job.
After all, papa took him in when he was starving and gave him a house to live in.
Come, Mattie, it's only an old tool shed.
You can still throw a cat through the south wall.
It's got a good roof.
- This game's crooked.
- What do you mean?
You've been dealing me seconds!
Goddamn crooks!
You've been stacking the decks!
Aw, come on, Tom.
We got our business done, we want to make an early start for home.
I don't think it's happening here.
Them card sharks is cheatin' me.
I wanna get my money back.
Not full of whisky and with a gun, that's no way.
A gun'll say a whole lot quick.
You work for me,
I won't allow you to get in trouble.
- Give me your gun.
- I'll give you one end of it.
Give me that gun. Give me your gun.
All aboard!
Can you tell me where the undertaker is?
Around the corner from the courthouse, ma'am.
Thank you.
Can't understand all these people being here.
Man on the train told me everybody comin' here from every place.
I'd like to know why.
They're hanging three men today at the courthouse.
We better go and see about papa.
I'll get you!
Man out rustling up business for himself, looks like.
Seems like we have us a lot of time to waste before we see anybody much.
I can tell what you want, Yarnell.
You want to go to that hanging.
'Fraid I can't.
Your mama said to keep an eye on you.
Well, I'll go along.
Don't worry, I won't tell mama.
Who wants peanuts?! Fresh!
Hot tamales!
That man up there on the porch...
That's Judge Parker.
He watches all the hangings.
- He says it's his sense of duty.
- Who knows what's in a man's heart?
Hangman's a Yankee.
They say he won't spring the trap on a boy that wore the blue.
No, I'm here. I'll see it all.
My goodness.
That's not a faint-hearted judge.
Chaney would get his due before such a judge.
Is that the man?
That is my father.
If you would like to kiss him, it will be all right.
No.
Put the lid on it.
I'm Mattie Ross of near Dardanelle in Yell County, and this is my friend, Yarnell
Poindexter, he works on our place.
Yes, ma'am.
State your business.
My father was killed in Fort Smith by a coward named Tom Chaney.
I'm here to find out what you're doing about the murder.
Well, we do know this much: his name's
Chambers, he's now in Indian territory, we think he was with Lucky Ned Pepper robbing a mail hack
Tuesday down on the Poteau River, he's a medium-height man with a black mark on his cheek.
That's a description of Tom Chaney, there's no Chambers to it.
He got that black mark when a man fired a pistol in his face and the powder got under the skin.
Why aren't you out looking for him?
I have no authority in the Indian Nation.
He's now the business of the US marshal.
Who's the best marshal they have?
Bill Waters is the best tracker.
The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn, a pitiless man, double tough, fear don't enter into his thinking.
I'd have to say L.T. Quinn is the straightest, he brings his prisoners in alive.
Where would I find this Rooster?
He'll be at the federal court this afternoon.
His bringing in a load of prisoners from the territory.
- Is Chaney one of them?
- I don't know, that's federal business.
Your father's gun, you'll...
...want to take it home, I expect.
His saddle is at Colonel Stonehill's stock barn and the rest of his things are at the Monarch Boarding House.
I won't rest until Tom Chaney's barking in hell.
Yarnell...
...you stay with Papa.
When you get him home, you put him in a better coffin, and you bury him in Mason's apron.
Your mama ain't gonna like you not coming home with me.
Mama knows I can take care of myself.
And tell her not to sign anything until I get back.
People will take it wrong that I leave this to you, Yarnell, but I got Papa's business to attend to.
Now, you tell Mama that I'm staying at the Monarch Boarding House and I'm gonna stop over and see if Tom Chaney's one of the prisoners.
And then I'll see this Rooster Cogburn.
All right, get outta the way!
Back up!
Back up!
Stand up!
Come on out!
Move along!
Are those the prisoners from the Indian territory?
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know if any one of them is Tom Chaney?
Cogburn ain't turned in his list yet.
- Which marshal is Rooster Cogburn?
- The big fella with the eye patch.
Come on!
All right, take it away!
- Mr. Cogburn!
- Wait! You come back here!
Mr. Cogburn! Mr. Cogburn!
I said you come back here!
All right, come on up.
If Mr. Cogburn thinks I'm gonna be put off by a locked door, he does not know me!
I will be here when it opens.
When it opens, you're gonna be mighty hungry.
Best time for you to nail Rooster would be tomorrow.
He's due to testify before Judge Parker in the Wharton case.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate your kindness.
Have some more dumplings, dear?
At the rate of 25 cents per meal,
I might just as well.
I was hoping you were enjoying the dumplings.
They're all right. I can't see 25 cents in a little flour and grease.
- You're late, Mr. La Boof.
- The French is "La Boeuf,"
I call it "La Beef".
Mr. La Boeuf came in this evening.
Your spurs, please.
My poor chairs are scratched enough already.
A right fancy rig, sir.
Watch out for the chicken and dumplings.
- They'll hurt your eyes.
- How's that?
They'll hurt your eyes looking for the chicken!
You squirrel-headed bastard!
Howdy. What's your name?
I'd like to go to bed now. But first
I'd like to see my father's traps.
I'll take a guess and say your name is Mattie Ross.
- This Mr. La Boeuf is a handsome man.
- He needs a bath and a shave.
He hails from Texas.
Judge he's right proud of his cowlick.
How do you suppose he guessed my name?
He's a good guesser, I guess!
We're short of rooms on account of the hanging.
But you'll sleep in here with Grandma Turner.
Now, don't you worry about Grandma
Turner, she's used to doubling up.
I take it my rent will be half, then?
This is your father's traps.
The watch and the knife are inside.
The man Chaney stole his money and his horse.
What is your opinion of a federal marshal called Rooster Cogburn?
Rooster Cogburn! Lord, I've heard some terrible things about him!
He loves to pull a cork, I know that!
His Honour, Judge Parker!
All rise!
I'll have a peppermint to settle my stomach.
Yes, sir. Right, sir.
The United States Court of the western district, having criminal jurisdiction in the
Indian territory, is now in session.
Is that Judge Parker, the hanging judge?
Yeah. He's a tough customer.
There's no appeal from his court except to the President of the United States!
Call Deputy Marshal Cogburn.
Mr. Reuben J. Cogburn will take the stand.
Sworn this morning, you're still sworn. Take the stand.
Defence will cross-examine.
Mr. Cogburn, you testified for the prosecution this morning.
Now, in order to refresh our memories, allow me to summarise what you said.
According to your story...
...C. C. Wharton grabbed a shotgun and killed Marshal Potter.
Then he turned the gun on you, you say, and you shot him.
Then you say the father swung his axe, and you shot him, too.
The defendant here tried to run, you say, and you also shot him.
Just winged him, or he wouldn't be here to pay up.
The old man and C.C. hit the ground dead.
How long have you been a deputy marshal, Mr. Cogburn?
Four years, come March.
How many men have you shot in that time?
- The prosecution objects!
- Overruled!
How many men have you shot since you became a marshal, Mr. Cogburn?
- I never shot nobody I didn't have to!
- That was not the question. How many?
Shot or killed?
Let's restrict it to killed, so we may have a manageable figure!
Well, 12 to 15, stopping men in flight and defending myself.
Twelve to fifteen? So many that you cannot keep a specific count.
I have examined the records,
Mr. Cogburn.
A much more accurate figure is available. Come now, how many?
Counting them two Whartons, 23.
I felt you would come to it with a little effort.
Twenty-three dead men in four years.
That makes about six men a year!
It's a dangerous business.
How much more dangerous for those arrested by you?
Now, is it not true that you sprang upon old man Wharton and his two sons with a deadly six-shot revolver in your hand?
- I always try to be ready.
- Was this revolver loaded and cocked?
A gun that's unloaded and cocked ain't good for nothing!
Just answer my questions, if you please.
- Well, the question don't make sense!
- Don't bandy words with counsel.
Yes, sir.
I believe you testified that you backed away from old man Wharton.
- Yes, sir.
- Which direction were you going?
Backward! I always go backward when I'm backing away!
I appreciate the humour of that remark.
Aaron Wharton was standing by a pot when you arrived?
More like squatting. He was stirring the fire under the scalding pot.
- How far did you back away?
- Six, eight steps.
Meaning Wharton advanced on you the same distance? Six or eight steps?
- Say about 16 feet?
- Something like that.
Then will you explain why the body was found immediately by the wash pot, one arm in the flames, the sleeve and hand smouldering?
Them hogs. They was rooting around, they may have moved the body.
Hogs, indeed.
Mr. Goudy, do you have anymore questions for Mr. Cogburn?
None that I'll get a straight answer to.
I'm finished with him.
You're dismissed, Mr. Cogburn.
Call the next witness!
Cecil Falling Leaf, take the stand!
Raise your right hand.
- Mr. Rooster Cogburn?
- What is it?
I'd like to talk with you a minute.
They tell me you're a man with true grit.
Well, what do you want? Speak up!
You've already wrinkled the paper.
It's pretty loose because your makings are too dry.
- I'm looking for Tom Chaney.
- Well, who's he?
He shot and killed my father,
Frank Ross.
They tell me he's in the Indian territory and I need somebody to go after him.
- Well, who are you?
- Mattie Ross.
My family has 480 acres of good bottomland near Dardanelle in Yell County.
My mother's home looking after my baby sister and my brother, Little Frank.
Well then, why don't you go home and leave me alone?
They'll need help with the churning.
Mr. Cogburn!
You can get a fugitive warrant for Tom Chaney and the government will give you two dollars for bringing him in, plus ten cents a mile for each of you, and I'll give you $50 reward.
Well, you've looked into this right smart.
- Yes, I have. I mean business.
- What have you got there in your poke?
By God, girl, that's a Colt's Dragoon!
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin.
What are you doing with all this pistol?
It belonged to my father.
He carried it bravely in the war and I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it, if the law fails to do so.
Well this'll sure get the job done, if you can find a fence post to rest it on while you take aim!
I'm afraid nothing's gonna be done about Chaney unless I do it myself.
I don't think you've got $50.
I've got some horse-trading to do,
I'll have it by tomorrow.
Do you know a robber by the name of Lucky Ned Pepper?
I know him... well!
I shot him in the lip last August over at Winding Stair Mountains.
He was lucky that day all right, my shooting was off.
Well, I think Tom Chaney's tied up with him.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Ned Pepper, huh?
- Yeah.
Well, baby sister,
I don't think you can get $50.
But if you're hungry,
I'll take you home and give you supper.
We'll talk it over.
Make medicine. How does that suit you?
Right down to the ground.
I'd like to meet your family.
This is my father, Chen Lee, and my nephew, General Sterling Price.
You want more, missy?
I've had enough, and enough is good as a feast.
I've never seen chopsticks work before.
Chopsticks save your fingers.
- Give me your cup.
- I don't drink coffee, thank you.
Well, now, what do you drink?
I'm partial to cold buttermilk.
Well, we ain't got none of that.
We ain't got no lemonade, neither.
Let's get to the game.
- My deal?
- Yes, sir.
- What about my proposition?
- I'm thinking on it.
Sounds like a mighty easy way to make $50 to me.
Don't crowd me. I'm figuring expenses.
Don't see how you can play cards and drink whiskey and think of this detective business all at the same time.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, if I have to go up against Ned Pepper, it'll cost $100.
I figured that much out.
- And $50 in advance.
- You're trying to take advantage of me.
I'm giving you my children's rates.
It isn't going to be easy smoking old Ned out.
He'll be holed up down in that Indian Nation.
Well, I hope you don't think
I'm going to keep you in whiskey.
I don't buy that, I confiscate it.
A touch of it wouldn't do you any harm against the night air.
No, thank you.
Well, it's the real article.
Genuine, double-rectified busthead.
Aged in the keg.
I would not put a thief in my mouth to steal my brains.
Well, sis, my price is $100.
There it is. Want to make medicine?
I will think about your proposition and talk to you again.
Now, I wanna go to the Monarch Boarding House.
You better walk me over there.
You are a lot of trouble.
Wait till I finish this hand.
You can never tell what's in a Chinaman's mind.
That's the way he bests you at cards.
I go.
Scat!
Mr. Rat...
...I have a writ here says you're to stop eating
Chen Lee's cornmeal forthwith.
Now, it's a rat writ, writ for a rat, and this is lawful service of same.
See? Doesn't pay any attention to me.
- Outside is place for shooting!
- I'm serving some papers.
That was your job in the first place.
You can't serve papers on a rat, baby sister.
You got to kill him or let him be.
- What's your thoughts on it?
- You going to drink all of that?
Judge Parker, old carpetbagger, but he knows his rats.
We had a good court going around here
'til them pettifogging lawyers moved in.
A rat catcher's too tough on the rats.
"Give them rats a fair show," they say.
Well, what kind of a fair show did they give old man Potter?
Tell me that.
Finer man never lived.
You're useless in this condition.
I'll walk over there by myself.
- You scared of the dark?
- I've never been scared of the dark.
Well, if I had a big horse pistol like that,
- I wouldn't be scared of no boogerman.
- I'm not scared of no boogerman.
- Sugar?
- No, thanks.
- Cream?
- Please.
Just a dab.
Oh, Miss Ross.
I've been waiting to have some private words with you.
And you, dear lady,
I find a sweet distraction, as I suppose most men do.
- Will you excuse us?
- Why, of course, Mr. La Boeuf.
What do you want of me?
Who are you?
- Nobody yet, but I expect to go high.
- How?
Well, to begin with,
I expect to marry well.
Well, you have the hair combed for it.
How'd you know my name was Mattie Ross?
I saw your mother yesterday.
What business did you have with her?
This.
Can you identify the man in this picture?
It's a likeness of Tom Chaney.
There's no black mark on his face, but that's him.
I'm looking for him and I hear you're looking for him, too.
I know all about your father.
How come you didn't show me this last night when we met?
I only take one step at a time.
That's why I was given two feet.
His real name is Theron Chelmsford.
He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs down in Waco, Texas.
I've been on his trail the best part of four months now.
- You some kind of law?
- Yeah.
I'm a sergeant in the Texas Rangers.
I'm working for the family of the late Senator Bibbs.
Chelmsford or Chaney as you call him, he shot and killed the Senator's bird dog. Bibbs threatened to whip him, and Chaney shot the old gentleman while he was sitting in a porch swing.
Well, you need not worry about Chaney anymore. I aim to have him hanged.
The sheriff informed me that you were looking for a man to go after Chaney in the Indian territory.
I've already found one for the job.
His name is Rooster Cogburn.
He's a deputy marshal for the federal court, toughest one they have.
Maybe I'll throw in with you and your federal marshal.
You'll have to talk that over with Rooster Cogburn.
It's to our mutual advantage.
He knows the land, and I know Chaney.
It's at least a two-man job to take him alive.
And I must have him alive down to McLennan County, Texas.
When we get Chaney, we're not taking him back to Texas.
We're taking him to Fort Smith and hang.
Is it important where he hangs?
- It is to me.
- Well, more so to me.
There's a well-placed young lady in Waco who'd look with favour on me if I brought in Chaney.
Now, wouldn't a hanging in Texas serve you just as well
- as the hanging in Fort Smith?
- No.
I want Tom Chaney to pay for killing my father, not for some Texas bird dog.
It won't be for the dog.
It'll be for the senator and your father too. Chaney will be just as dead.
Well, if in four months
I could not find Tom Chaney with a mark on his face like banished Cain,
I would not advise others how to do it.
A little earlier, I gave some thought to stealing a kiss from you, although you are very young and you're unattractive to boot.
But now I'm of a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt.
One would be as unpleasant as the other.
Lay a hand on me and you'll answer for it. You Texans are ignorant of our ways.
Good people of this state don't go easy on men who abuse women and children.
The children of Texans are brought up to show a little more respect for their elders.
I also noticed that people of your state gouge their horses with great brutal spurs and cultivate their hair like lettuce.
You'll push that saucy line too far.
Mr. La Boeuf, I have no regard for you, but I'm sure you have enough for yourself to go around.
They are all for sale...
...except those four scrubby ones.
- And, who do they belong to?
- The heirs of the late Frank Ross.
I'm Mattie Ross.
I'd like to sell you back those ponies that my father bought.
I fear that is out of the question.
My father bought those ponies for breeding.
Now, I've looked at them, and they're all geldings.
You cannot breed geldings.
That hardly concerns me.
Your father bought four ponies and paid $100 for them, and there's an end of it.
I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse that was stolen from your barn.
You'll have to take that up with the man who stole it.
Tom Chaney stole it while it was in your care. You are responsible.
I admire your sand, but I am not liable.
- I will take it to the law.
- You must do as you think best.
We will see if a widow and three small children can get fair treatment in the courts of this city.
- You have no case.
- Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle
- in Yell County may think otherwise.
- You are impudent.
I do not wish to be, sir, but I will not be pushed about when I'm in the right.
I'll take it up with my attorney.
And I will take it up with mine.
Lawyer Daggett.
And he will make money, and I will make money, and your lawyer will make money.
And you, Mr. Licensed Auctioneer, you will foot the bill.
You are a damn nuisance.
Lawyer Daggett? Lawyer Daggett?
Who is this famous pleader whose name I was happily ignorant of 10 minutes ago?
Have you ever heard of the Great Arkansas River Vicksburg and Gulf and Steamship Company?
I have done business with the G.A.V. & G., yes.
Well, he was the one that forced them into receivership.
They tried to mess with him.
All right. Come inside.
Sit down.
I will pay a total of $200 to your father's estate when I have in my hand a letter absolving me of all liability from the beginning of the world to date.
I want $200 for Papa's horse, Judy, plus another $100 for the ponies.
That's $300 total.
The ponies have no part in this.
I will not buy them back.
Then I'll keep the ponies and the price for Judy alone will be $300.
Three hun... I wouldn't pay that for a winged Pegasus.
Now, listen very carefully, as I will not bargain further.
I will take the ponies back, and keep your father's saddle, and settle for $200.
My lawyer would not wish me to consider anything under $300.
For that, you get everything except the saddle.
I would like to have that in writing, for what it is worth.
When I have it in my hand,
I'll remit the extortion money.
Now, this is your release.
You'll find it in order.
You had that already written out.
- I'll give you a check.
- I prefer cash.
One hundred. Two hundred.
Three hundred.
Now, I'm sure you'll find a buyer for those ponies very soon.
I have a tentative offer of $10 a head from the soap works at Little Rock.
It seems such a shame to render such spirited horseflesh into soap.
I'm confident the deal will fall through.
- You can expect me back for my saddle.
- I'm sure I can.
Do you know a Marshal Rooster Cogburn?
Most people around here have heard of Rooster Cogburn, and some people live to regret it.
I would not be surprised to learn that he's a relative of yours.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Where's Rooster Cogburn?
- Sleep late. Very drunk last night.
I've never seen anybody in bed at 10:00 in the morning who wasn't sick.
Coffee.
You ain't such an early bird yourself, baby sister.
I just about give up on you.
I figured you'd gone home.
You need some more slats in that bed.
Yeah. Well, trouble is, there's no slats in it at all.
Some kind of a damn
Chinese rope bed torture contraption.
I'd like to burn it...
God, don't you got it.
How much is there?
You still game?
Baby sister, I was born game and I intend to go out that way.
All right. One understanding, that we leave for the territory this afternoon to get Tom Chaney.
- Well, you're not going.
- You've misjudged me.
I can't go up against Ned Pepper's gang and try and take care of a baby
- all at the same time.
- I'm not a baby.
You'll slow me down. There's no hot grub or warm beds out there.
I've slept out at night before.
Papa took me coon hunting last summer.
Well, this ain't no coon hunt and
It's no place for a shirttailed kid.
That's what they said about coon hunting.
First night out, you'd be calling, "Mama! Mama!"
I've left off crying.
Now make up your mind.
I'm aimed to get Tom Chaney and if you're not game,
I'll find somebody who is.
Now, I know you can drink whiskey and I saw you kill a rat.
But all the rest has been talk.
I'm not paying for talk.
I can get all the talk I need at the Monarch Boarding House.
I ought to paddle your rump.
I don't know how you propose to do that from the hog wallow you're sunk into.
If I smelled as bad as you,
I wouldn't live near people.
I've made up a short agreement here between us.
Sign it.
And here's $25.
I'll give you another $25 when we leave and $50 when the job is done.
Well, I guess we can get started at first light. We'll cross the ferry.
I want to talk to an informer in the Indian Nation.
Might know something.
I'll be more than ready.
Well, General...
...look what we got.
There's an old saw that says,
"One white foot, buy them...
...two white feet, try them.
Three white feet, be on the sly...
...four white feet, pass them by".
But I do not hold with that.
I just received word that a young girl fell head first into a 50-foot well on the Towsend road.
I thought perhaps it was you.
No, it was not I.
What do you hear from the Little Rock soap man?
Nothing.
Well, I'll take one of those ponies off your hands, the black one with the white stockings.
I will call him Little Blackie.
What is your offer?
I will pay the market price.
I believe the soap man offered you
$10 a head.
That is a lot price.
You will recall, I paid you $25 a head only this morning.
That was the market price at that time.
Tell me this...
...do you entertain plans of ever leaving this city?
Yes. I'm off early tomorrow morning for the Indian Nation.
Marshal Rooster Cogburn and I are going after the murderer Tom Chaney.
Cogburn. How did you light on that greasy vagabond?
They say he has grit.
- I wanted a man with grit.
- Well, I suppose he has that.
He's a notorious thumper.
He's not a man
I would care to share a bed with.
- Nor would I.
- I wouldn't trust him too much.
I have only paid him a token payment.
The balance will be paid when the job is done.
It may prove to be a long, hard journey.
A good Christian does not flinch from these difficulties.
Neither does he rashly court them.
The good Christian is not wilful or presumptuous.
- You think I'm wrong?
- I think you are wrong-headed.
I will pay you $12 for that pony, if you shoe him for me.
I will not ride a barefoot pony.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Howdy.
- What are you doing here?
I'm having a little conversation with the marshal.
Sit down, sis. Have some taffy.
This jaybird says he's on the track of the same man we're after, like to throw in with us.
I've already told him we're not interested in his help.
He's gone behind my back.
Well, a fellow that carries a big-bore Sharps Carbine might come in handy, if we get jumped by elephants or buffalo or something.
We don't need him.
- Got everything ready?
- All but the grub.
I reckon I must have the wrong man.
Do you let little girls hurrah you, Cogburn?
Would you mind repeating that, jaybird?
There's no hurrahing in it.
The marshal's working for me.
- How much she paying you?
- Enough.
Is she paying you $500?
No.
That's what the Governor of Texas has put up for this man she calls Chaney.
Payment on conviction.
- Five hundred dollars?
- Yep.
Very little for a man who's killed a senator.
Bibbs was a little senator.
Well, I guess I'll just stick with sis.
The Bibbs family's put up another $1,500 for Chaney.
Have they now. What are the terms?
Just deliver Chaney.
They don't care if he's alive or dead.
That's more to my liking.
How you figuring on splitting up the money?
Well, if we take him alive,
I'll split the $1,500 with you and keep the state reward of $500 for myself.
If we have to kill him, I'll give you
$500 of the Bibbs' money.
This man wants to take Chaney back to Texas. That's not what I want.
He wants him caught and punished, so do you.
I want Tom Chaney to hang for killing my father.
It's little to me how many dogs and senators he killed in Texas.
Well, you can tell him to his face, you can spit in his eye, you can make him eat sand out of the road, you can shoot him in the foot, and I'll hold him for you.
But first, we got to catch him.
You got to learn you can't have everything your own way.
When I bought and paid for something,
I'll have it my way.
I don't understand this conversation at all.
She ain't going, anyhow.
You run along home, little britches, your mama wants you.
- I told her she could go.
- No.
She'll make nothing but trouble.
Maybe I'll catch this Chaney by myself and take all the money.
You might deliver him, but I'd see to it that you didn't collect a thing for it.
How'd you go about that?
I'd dispute your claim,
I'd muddy up the water.
You do that and I'll kill you.
I wouldn't count too much on being able to shade somebody I didn't know, fellow.
I ain't never seen nobody from Texas I couldn't shade.
La Boeuf, you get crossways of me, and you'll think a thousand of brick have fell on you.
You'll wished you was back at the Alamo with Travis.
- Knock him down, Rooster.
- Stay out of this.
That reward money's just a pig in the poke.
All La Boeuf is, is talk.
I've given you good cash money.
Look at him grin, he'll cheat you.
Fellow's got to think about himself once in a while, baby sister.
We'll get your man, that's the main thing.
Give me my $25 back.
Hand it over.
I spent it.
- You sorry piece of trash.
- I'll get it for you.
- I'll send it to you.
- That's a big story.
If you think you can cheat me you're mistaken.
You've not heard the last of Mattie Ross.
You may well hear from my lawyer, Daggett.
Lawyer Daggett?
Who's Lawyer Daggett?
I wouldn't worry about him.
I'd worry about our business at hand.
- Red.
- Good morning.
- The river looks kind of high.
- Yeah. It's been raining upcountry.
Who you looking for this time, Marshal?
Well now, Red, if I was to tell you that, you might tell him.
Well, you're well-enough armed.
I would say, "Tom Chaney, look out".
Can't you get anything through your head? You're not going.
Forget about the freight, Paddy, and take us on across.
You're not getting on this ferry.
This is open to the public.
I have paid my 10 cents for horse and rider.
Red, take this girl into town to the sheriff.
She's a runaway.
There's also a $50 reward.
- That's a big story.
- Ask the marshal.
Oh, she's a runaway, all right.
Bound to be paper on her.
They're in this story together.
I've got business across the river and if you interfere with me you may land up in court, which you don't want to be.
I've got a good lawyer in J. Noble Daggett.
- Lawyer Daggett again.
- She draws him like a gun.
I will not walk up that hill.
Well, I'm not about to let $50 slide.
Get on that horse, then.
Wait a minute.
I got to fix my hat.
Hey! Come back here!
By God! She reminds me of me.
Then we might just not get along.
Well, you were a little slow getting across.
I said you wasn't going.
Go back.
I will do no such thing.
La Boeuf...
Right.
Those horses can't get away from Little Blackie.
They're loaded down with fat men and iron.
Now we'll see what tune you sing.
I'm going to raise welts on you like worms.
See what good it does you!
You're not hurting me! I'm just mad!
- Are you going to let him do this?
- I don't believe I will.
Drop that switch, La Boeuf.
Put it down, I said.
You're enjoying it too much.
You'll find that
I go ahead with what I start.
You do, and it'll be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas brushpopper.
You've taken her part all along. But you ain't doing her no kindness here.
Just leave her alone.
Listen, this has given me a plan.
When we locate Chaney, we can jump him in the same way, hit him on the head with sticks and knock him insensible.
Then we can tie his feet and hands together and take him back alive.
What do you think?
I don't think you'd like to know what I think.
Get on your horse.
It's not dinnertime by now?
Dinnertime will come and go without notice on this trip.
Get on your horse.
Presbyterian, huh?
- Southern or Cumberland?
- Southern.
My folks are Cumberland.
Proud of it, too.
I was raised in an Episcopal church myself.
Figured you for some kind of kneeler.
Well, what did you learn?
Well, Ned was sighted at McAlester's store about three days ago.
He goes there from time to time to pay attention to a lewd woman.
There's an old thief named Hayes with him and a Mexican on a round-bellied pony.
Our man Chaney wasn't seen, but it's certain he was in on that mail hijacking job.
Stew?
This is worse than a pig trail.
- Shortest way to McAlester's.
- How far is it?
Around 60 miles. We'll make 15 today, get an early start tomorrow.
How do you like this coon hunt, sister?
Don't be looking around for me,
I'll be right here.
You look like a hog on ice.
Bucket is heavy.
I'm stronger than I look.
What did you bring for us to eat?
Salt...
...red pepper...
...taffy.
Carry those in your pockets?
Yeah. Along with cartridges and skinning knife.
- What are those things?
- Corn dodgers.
Goodness. How many you got in there?
Must be 175.
Can't scarcely credit that.
Yeah. Chen Lee must've thought it was for a wagonload of marshals.
That tastes like iron.
You're lucky to be where water's so handy.
I've seen the time
I've drank out of a filthy hoof print, and I was glad to get it.
If ever I meet one of you Texas waddies who ain't drunk water from a hoof print,
I think I'll shake their hand or buy them a Daniel Webster cigar.
How long you boys down there been mounted on sheep?
Go ahead and have your little joke, but I'll tell you one thing, that little fellow there will still be running when that big American stud of yours is winded and collapsed.
Sheep.
Don't you think that fire's a little big if we're going to pass unnoticed?
A small fire's ranger's policy.
Yeah.
- Of all the dumb things to do...
- Hey, listen. I have an idea.
How would you two like to hear the story of the midnight caller?
Now, one of you'll have to play the caller,
I'll tell you what to say and I'll play all the other parts.
Fine. Go ahead and tell it.
I'll tell the story if you stop drinking.
Let it go.
That, baby sister, is no trade.
Least Little Blackie likes the corn dodgers.
It's the salt in them.
We won't get to McAlester's by dark, so we better head for a dugout I know.
It's empty, and we can shelter in it.
We can eat your turkey there.
- I don't see how. It's all ripped up.
- Yeah. Pretty chewed.
Too much gun.
I thought you said it'd be empty.
Who are you?
What do you want?
- We're looking for a place to sleep.
- Well, there's no room for you here.
Try that on the chimney.
I am a federal officer.
Speak up. Who's in there?
None of your damn business.
Keep riding.
- Is that Emmett Quincy?
- We don't know any Emmett Quincy!
Emmett, this is Rooster.
I got five more marshals out here,
- and we got a bucket of coal oil.
- Drink it!
One more minute, and you're going to drink it.
Chuck your guns out, follow them with your hands high, and nobody'll get hurt!
If that coal oil goes down the chimney, we're killing everybody that comes out that door.
There's no five marshals out there.
Well, now, don't you bet your life on it.
- Moon can't walk. He's hit.
- Well, drag him out.
What kind of papers you got on me?
Got no papers on you.
You better move.
Tell those others to be careful with their guns.
We're coming out.
Hit the dirt. Belly down.
Spread-eagle.
I forgot they was there.
Get inside. Both of you.
Wrap that around your leg.
Put the horses in the lean-to.
Cuff them.
Get up.
Sit down.
Get down there!
You fellows are way too jumpy.
What have you been up to, besides stealing stock?
You said you ain't got no papers on us.
Well, not by name, but I got a few John Does.
Resisting a federal officer.
That's a year right there.
- But my leg hurts.
- I'll bet it do, sonny boy.
Now you just sit right still so it won't bleed so bad.
When's the last time you saw Ned Pepper?
I don't remember any Ned Pepper.
Short, feisty fellow. Nervous and quick.
Got a messed-up lower lip.
That don't bring nobody to mind.
- A funny lip?
- Wasn't always like that.
- I shot him in it.
- In the lower lip?
- What was you aiming at?
- His upper lip.
Ned's got a new boy running with him with a black powder mark on his face.
That don't bring nobody to mind either.
You don't know anything I want to know, do you?
- If I did know, I wouldn't blow.
- How about you?
I always like to help the law as long as it don't harm my friends.
Pretty good idea,
'cause otherwise I'll turn you in back at Fort Smith.
By that time, that leg of yours will be swelled up tighter than Dick's hatband.
Mortify, and they'll have to cut it off.
And then if you live,
I'll get you three or four years
- in a federal penitentiary.
- You're trying to get at me.
Of course, if you talk,
I'll take you to McAlester's.
They'll get that ball out of your leg, and I'll give you two, three days to get out of the territory.
Don't go flapping your mouth, Moon.
I'll do the talking.
Yeah. You listen to Quincy, Moon, and you'll lose your leg or your life.
Quincy ain't hurting.
Don't let him spook you!
Ain't got nothing on us.
Been looking around outside.
Six horses in the stock shelter.
What kind of horses?
Right good mounts to me.
They're all shod.
- These men are waiting for somebody.
- You don't say.
If you won't talk, you can keep busy.
Cut that up for frying.
What are you looking at?
Who are you?
I'm Mattie Ross of near Dardanelle in Yell County.
What the hell's she doing here?
I don't understand it!
She's after the man that killed her father.
His name is Tom Chaney.
He's a whiskey drinker like you.
Led to killing in the end.
Now, if you'll just answer the marshal's questions, he'll help you.
I have a good lawyer at home.
He'll help you, too.
Don't get to jawing with these people, Moon.
- We'll get clear of this.
- I don't like the way you look.
- You talking to me, runt?
- Yes. I don't like the way you look.
And I don't like the way you're cutting up that turkey!
Rooster, this Quincy's making a mess of that turkey.
Do the job right, Quincy, or I'll have you eating them feathers.
I hope you go to jail.
My lawyer will not help you.
It's a shame, a kid like Moon losing his leg.
Too young to be hopping around on a log peg.
Loves to dance too much, and sports.
- You're trying to get at me again.
- I'm getting at you with the truth.
We seen Ned and Ace two days ago at McAlester's.
You blow, and I'll kill you!
I'm played out, Quincy. I got to have a doctor! I'll tell what I know.
Oh, Lord! Oh, God!
I'm dying. Help me, I'm dying.
I can't do a thing for you, son.
Your partner's killed you, and I've done for him.
Don't leave me laying here.
Don't let those wolves get me.
I'll see you get buried.
Where's Ned Pepper?
They're going to rob the Katy Flyer.
They're coming here tonight for remounts. They wanted four horses.
Did you see a fellow with them with a powder burn on his face?
No.
My brother... George Garrett,
Methodist circuit rider out of Austin, Texas.
When's Pepper due here?
Sell my traps, Rooster.
Send that money to my brother.
Do you want us to tell your brother what happened to you?
It doesn't matter. He knows.
I'll meet him later, walking the streets of glory.
- Don't expect to see Quincy there.
- Quincy?
He never played me false until he killed me.
Let me have a cool drink of water.
Look. I still have fingers there.
Let me have that.
- It's one of Papa's gold pieces.
- Are you sure?
Yes. It was minted in California.
It says so. Worth a little over $36.
Grandpa Sperling gave Papa two of these when he married Mama.
Looks like we're on Chaney's trail.
At least we're on Ned's.
Give me the key to these cuffs.
Now, go saddle the horses.
Well, Moon said they were coming here.
You aim to run?
I aim to do what I come here to do.
Saddle the horses.
Straighten up the place.
You take your horse and find a position over there.
I'll be up on this side and don't shoot unless I do.
Now, what we want to do is get them in that dugout.
I'll shoot the last man through the door and we'll have them over a barrel.
You'd shoot them without a call?
That'll get him to know our intentions is serious.
Well, I'll holler down after I shoot.
See if any of them want to be taken alive.
When they won't, we'll shoot them as they come out the door.
- I want Chaney alive.
- And so does the Governor of Texas.
All I know is there's a lot of them and only two of us.
Why don't I try to nick Chaney before he gets inside?
Any shooting before they get in that dugout, and they'll break.
We're apt to come up with an empty sack.
All right.
But if they break, I'll nick Chaney.
You hit Chaney with that Sharps rifle of yours, you're apt to kill him.
- Yes. Remember the turkey?
- Yeah.
You go after Ned.
I'll take care of Chaney.
What does Ned look like?
He's a short, feisty fellow.
Do most of the talking.
- Where does she go?
- I go where Rooster goes.
- You stay here. Keep the horses quiet.
- Can't see anything from over there.
Haven't you seen enough killings for one day?
I'm not staying here by myself.
Wait a minute. I'll get my revolver.
What for?
So you can shoot your own foot off?
Why do you keep that one chamber empty?
So I won't shoot my foot off.
Corn dodger?
Light a match and let me see it first.
- What for?
- Some of them got blood on them.
Well, we ain't lighting no matches.
Well, I don't want any.
What did you do before you became a peace officer?
Just about everything...
...except keep school.
How'd you lose your eye?
It was in the war.
The Lone Jack.
Little scrap outside of Kansas City.
What did you do after the war?
I robbed me a federal paymaster and went to Cairo, Illinois, and bought a eating place there called the Green Frog and married a grass widow.
- Place had a billiard table.
- You never told me you had a wife.
Oh, well, I didn't have her long.
My friends was a pack of river rats.
She didn't crave their society, so she upped and left me and went back to her first husband who was clerking in a hardware store in Paducah.
"Goodbye, Reuben," she says,
"the love of decency does not abide in you".
That's a divorced woman talking for you, about decency.
Well, I told her,
I said, "Goodbye, Nola, and I hope that nail-selling bastard makes you happy this time".
Did you have any children?
There was a boy.
Nola taken him with her.
He never liked me anyway.
A clumsier child you'll never see than Horace. I bet he broke 40 cup.
Never did get you for stealing that money.
Why, I didn't consider it stealing.
- It didn't belong to you.
- I needed a road stake.
It was like that little high-interest bank in New Mexico.
Needed a road stake, and there it was.
I never robbed no citizen or taken a man's watch.
It's all stealing.
That's the position them New Mexicans took. I had to flee for my life.
Bo was a young colt then.
No horse could run him into the ground.
When that posse thinned out,
I turned old Bo around, and taking them reins in my teeth,
I charged them boys firing two navy sixes.
They must've all been married men that loved their families
'cause they scattered and run for home.
You don't have any family, do you?
Except Chen Lee and that lazy cat.
General Price don't belong to me.
Cats don't belong to nobody.
He just rooms with me.
'Course, I depend on him.
Well, baby sister, you better try and get some sleep.
I'll wake you up when they get here.
Looks like Moon was telling the truth.
- What are they doing?
- They're smelling around.
You see Chaney?
Can't make out their faces.
Well, that's Ned Pepper, all right.
Quincy!
Moon!
- That's him hollering.
- Moon!
That's the original
Mexican Bob with him.
You mean there's more than one?
Yeah. There's a younger one, but he ain't a patch to this one.
Moon!
Quincy!
Now he done it!
Over here, Ned!
I'm hit!
They don't call him
"Lucky" Ned Pepper for nothing.
That man gave his life for him.
He didn't even look back.
Yeah. Looking back is a bad habit.
Well...
Well, what's your story?
I was on the move to a better place.
I heard the first shot, and I thought you'd opened up.
More likely asleep.
You know who they are?
The one on the sand spit is old Hayes.
The boy...
...I don't know.
He's not much older than I am.
That's nothing but a little scratch.
Well, that's nothing to do with you.
Why don't you go make us some coffee?
It won't take long.
- Let it go and go on inside.
- Why are you being so foolish?
Well, La Boeuf, you're quite a horse shooter.
I was trying for Ned Pepper.
Well, next time, try for the horse and maybe you'll hit Pepper.
What are we waiting for?
- I say we ride after them.
- And I say no.
I know where they're going to earth.
You can't take men by watching them run away.
Back up. I know this country, and I know these men.
We'll take the horses and the dead in to McAlester.
And I'll put in a claim for any reward the railroad may have offered.
- You backed up?
- Some, for now.
Damn a man that whistles.
Maybe he's trying to keep his mind off of his hand.
You don't think very much of me, do you, Cogs?
Don't think about you at all.
You keep your mouth closed.
I was told in Fort Smith that you rode with Quantrill and that border trash.
And I heard Quantrill and his men weren't soldiers at all
- but a bunch of murdering thieves.
- I heard the same thing.
I heard they murdered women and children in the Lawrence raid.
I heard that, too, and it's a damn lie.
What outfit were you with during the war?
- Freeport, with Kirby Smith.
- I mean, what side were you on?
I served with General Kirby Smith.
I don't have to hang my head when I say it, either.
Go ahead and make another joke about it.
You want to make me look foolish in the girl's eyes, anyway.
You don't need me for that.
I don't like the way you make conversation.
And I don't like your conversation about Captain Quantrill.
Captain? Captain of what?
A bunch of thieves?
Young fellow, if you're looking for trouble, I'll accommodate you.
Otherwise, leave it alone.
You know, I've been thinking about
Lucky Ned Pepper.
Maybe he planned on murdering those two stock thieves so they wouldn't inform against him.
- No. Ned wouldn't do that.
- Why not?
Ned doesn't go around killing people for no reason.
Had he a reason, he'd kill them.
It looks like we might joggle some of our passengers off.
Well, they're past hurting.
We'll tie up here, if you don't mind.
Sure, Marshal.
You got quite a load there.
Yeah, about half the load
I was looking for.
Why don't you go in and meet Mrs. McAlester?
She'll fix you some dinner.
I want to have a word with the peace officer.
I want to go, too.
I'll tell the wife to fix something for all of you.
Well, why don't you go inside?
Maybe Mrs. McAlester can fix that poor little hand of yours.
My poor little hand can keep.
- Rooster, what are you doing here?
- Boots, Gaspargo.
How come you're letting that Indian get behind you with a cutting tool?
'Cause I'm an Indian.
I've seen plenty of Indian scalps on Indian belts.
If you're after little Ned Pepper, you're on a cold trail here.
We're looking for another man, too.
He's got a black mark on his face, carries a Henry rifle.
We think maybe he's running with Ned.
Go ahead.
That's what Texas calls a peace officer.
Well, Ned passed through here a couple of days ago.
Him and Hayes, Mexican Bob.
Only them three was seen.
I have a pretty good idea where Ned's holed up.
If he is where I think he is, it will take 100 marshals to smoke him out.
My name's Mattie Ross from near Dardanelle in Yell County.
That man with the black mark on his face, he killed my father.
His name's Tom Chaney.
Boots, I got Hayes and some youngster outside with Moon and Quincy.
I want you to bury them for me.
- I'm in a hurry.
- They're dead?
Well, I wouldn't want you to bury them if they wasn't.
What about La Boeuf's hand?
Gaspargo's a pretty good doctor when he ain't currying hair.
- Take care of it.
- It can wait.
You're of no good use when you're handicapped.
And small use if he ain't.
- Wash first.
- Why?
- Don't you wash before you eat?
- I'm not going to eat his hand.
- Don't you know about germs?
- No.
Go wash, Gaspargo. You lost.
That's Moon.
Quincy.
Hayes.
First time he ever stayed shot.
I know this boy, Billy Walsh.
He comes from a good family down by the south Canadian.
Well, then hold good boy Billy for his folks and bury the rest of them.
I'll post their names.
If anybody wants them, they can come dig them up.
Sell the horses and get what you can for their coats, guns, and saddles.
I'll split it with you.
You told Moon whatever his traps would fetch, you'd send it to his brother.
I forget where he said to send it.
His brother's a preacher named George Garrett.
He can be reached at the
Methodist Church in Austin, Texas.
Are you sure it was Austin?
Or was it Dallas?
You know it was Austin.
Write it out and give it to Captain.
Boots, send this man $10, and tell him his brother got caught and is buried here.
I'll do that.
So this is the man who shot
Ned Pepper's horse from under him.
Yeah, this is the famous horse killer from El Paso.
He believes in putting everybody afoot.
Says there'll be less mischief that way.
Fewer horses, fewer horse thieves.
How's your hand feel?
Both rifle and hand are ready to shoot again.
Straighter than before, I hope.
Well, sister, the time has come for me to ride hard and fast.
You stay here with the McAlesters.
I'll be back in two or three days with Tom Chaney.
You can't get shed of me.
- Well, she's come this far.
- That's far enough.
You think I'm gonna quit when we're so close?
There's something in what she's saying, Cogburn.
She's won her spurs.
I think she's done just fine.
Let it go. I've said my piece.
There'll be no more talk about
- who won whose spurs.
- I'm going.
Not because you say I can't, and not because you say I can.
I paid good cash money to be here and I'm on my own business.
Now, we'll have no more talk about it.
Let's eat.
What are you doing?
Looking for a sign.
You couldn't see it if you saw it.
We'll walk a ways.
You looking for sign again?
It was Bo.
He put his foot wrong.
He's tired.
This is no grade.
I've freighted iron stoves up harder grades than this.
We'll camp here.
Here.
I was a pretty fair hand with a jerkline when I was freighting in Colorado.
Worked for a fellow that was always down with something.
He was carrying around a 21-foot tapeworm, along with his business responsibilities.
That aged him.
Then his wife commenced running things.
I wasn't about to work for her.
So I told her so.
Women have no generosity.
Lord God, how they hate to pay up.
A man will never work for a woman, unless he's got clabber for brains.
What about the $25 I paid you?
What $25?
I will not bandy words with a drunkard.
And that's real smart. You've done nothing when you've bested a fool.
We have come near about
50 miles from McAlester.
We're close to Ned Pepper's camp.
Tomorrow we'll take him.
If we're as close to Ned Pepper as you say,
I don't think too much of making that fire.
Nobody asked you.
Where are you going with that canteen?
To wash the sleep off of me, of course.
We got no water to spare for foolishness.
Take a drink and let it go at that.
I'd say there's a stream down below there.
You'll wash and you'll get no breakfast!
We'll waste no more time!
Shouldn't one of us go down with her?
Might not be safe.
Well, safer for her than whatever she meets, man or beast.
Well...
I know you, little Mattie, the bookkeeper.
- And I know you, Tom Chaney.
- What are you doing?
There's no money for you to squeeze around here.
- I came to fetch water.
- That was not my meaning.
I'm here to take you back to Fort Smith and hang you.
And I think I will not go.
Now, how do you like that?
There's a posse of officers up the hill that'll force you to go.
How many officers?
I'd say right around 50, and they mean business.
So you just walk right in front of me, up that hill.
I think I'll oblige those officers to come after me.
If you refuse to go with me,
I'll have to shoot you.
Is that so?
You better cock your piece.
All the way back until it locks.
I know how to do it.
Now, you mean to say that you won't go with me on your own free will?
You just got it the other way around.
Now you will follow me.
I didn't think you'd do it.
Sis! Where are you?
I'm down here! I got Chaney!
I just didn't think you'd do it.
One of my short ribs is broke.
You killed my father when he was trying to help you.
You're just a piece of trash!
You also killed a senator in Texas when he was sitting on a porch swing.
Everything happens to me.
Now I'm shot by a child!
I'll shoot you again if you don't get up!
My father took you in when you were hungry.
You little busybody!
I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget!
Sis! Sis!
Hurry up! Down here!
Take her and go!
Up the hill with the horses, and don't stop.
Who all's out there?
Marshal Rooster Cogburn and 50 other officers.
They're all armed and they mean business.
Tell me another lie,
I'll stove in your head.
The truth! Who's out there?
Marshal Rooster Cogburn and a Texas Ranger.
Rooster!
Rooster, can you hear me?
You better answer, Rooster, or I'll kill this girl!
You know I'll do it!
You want me to kill her?
You do what you think is best, Ned.
What are you...
She's nothing to me.
Nothing but a runaway.
You and that ranger get moving double fast!
If I see you riding over that bald ridge to the north, I'll spare the girl!
You got five minutes!
We'll need more than five minutes, Ned.
I won't give you any more.
There'll be a party of marshals coming through here pretty soon.
You give me Tom Chaney and I'll mislead them for six hours.
You can throw in that spitfire of a girl, too.
Too thin, Rooster, too thin.
I won't trust you.
Your five minutes is running!
You better move!
All right, we're moving, but we'll need more than five minutes.
I never busted a cap on a woman or nobody much under 16, but it's enough that you know
I'll do what I have to do.
I'm Mattie Ross of Dardanelle in Yell County.
My family has property, and I don't know why I'm being treated like this.
Well, it's enough that you know
I'll do what I have to do.
I saw you shot at the dugout.
Where are your wounds?
My wounds heal by themselves from inside.
Bob, you and Harold stay here, keep a watch out below.
Keep this turkey cock quiet, or we'll have him for supper.
Why don't you shut up?
Is that man simpleminded?
All the Parmalees is touched, but Harold's the worst.
No, their Ma's the worst, then comes Harold's brother Farrell.
But they're all good shots.
Get there!
I'll wring your scrawny neck!
No, you won't.
Now, let that doctor and go get those horses saddled.
Farrell, lend him a hand.
You set there and be still.
Your five minutes is up.
They better show.
Now what are you doing here?
Tom Chaney shot my father to death in Fort Smith.
I was told that Rooster Cogburn has grit.
I hired him to go after the murderer.
I found him myself and I shot him.
If I'd killed him,
I would not be in this fix.
- My revolver misfired.
- They will do it.
Most girls like little play-prettys, but you like guns, don't you?
If I did, I'd have one that worked.
I'll give him a little more time.
Was that Rooster and the Ranger waylaid us last night?
Yes.
Did they take Quincy and Moon?
They're both dead.
It was a terrible thing to see.
- Do you need a good lawyer?
- I need a good judge.
That man called Hayes, he's dead, too, and the boy that saved your life.
I'm happy he done what he done, but he should've kept his head and looked out for himself.
Goes for your good friend Rooster.
Hey, Ned!
Rooster Cogburn is no good friend of mine.
He's a drunken, gabbing fool.
He led us right into your hands.
Now he's left me with a gang of cutthroats.
Is that what they call grit in Fort Smith?
We call it something else in Yell County.
I was shot from ambush.
And it was one of them officers got me.
How can you tell a big story like that?
We're five men and four horses, one of us stays behind.
That's you, Chaney. You lost the horse.
When we get out, I'll send somebody back to fetch you with a fresh mount.
What about me?
I'm not staying with Tom Chaney.
He won't harm you.
You understand that?
Rooster give us six hours if we keep this girl safe.
If she don't stay safe, you don't neither. You don't get paid.
- Let me ride up with you, Farrell.
- No!
- How about you, Bob?
- No.
Harold?
Do it again, Harold!
We'll see you tonight at Ma's.
What are you doing?
I'm getting some water so I can wash my hands.
A little smut won't hurt you.
That's true, or else you and your chums would surely be dead.
Don't provoke me!
There's rattlesnakes down there in that pit, and I'm going to throw you in it!
Lucky Ned Pepper said if you molest me, he will not pay you.
He is your boss, you must do as he tells you.
He has no idea of paying me.
He left me here, knowing I'll be caught.
If you let me go now, I will keep silent as to your whereabouts for two days.
I tell you I can do better than that.
I can shut you up forever!
All right, Chaney, that's enough!
Put your hands up.
You get over there.
- Everything's against me!
- You hurt, Mattie?
I'm the one who's hurt.
It was this girl who done it!
Where's Rooster?
He's down below, watching the front door.
He's found a place where we can watch.
- Where's Little Blackie?
- Rooster's got him.
You get over there, and you stay over there.
Watch out where you step.
He says there's deadly snakes in that hole.
Where is the girl, Ned?
She was in wonderful health when last I saw her.
I can't answer for her now.
You'll answer for her now.
Where is she?
Rooster! Make a run for it!
I got Mattie! Chaney, too!
Well, Rooster, will you give us the road?
I have business elsewhere.
Farrell, you and your brother stand clear.
I got no interest in you today.
Stand clear and you won't get hurt.
What's your intention?
You think one on four's a dogfall?
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned, or see you hanged in Fort Smith at the Judge Parker's convenience.
Which will it be?
I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man.
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!
Shoot them!
They're too far and they're moving too fast.
No grit?
Rooster Cogburn, not much.
Well, Rooster...
...I'm shot to pieces.
Hooray for the man from Texas!
Some bully shot.
Damn you, Bo.
First time you ever give me a reason to cuss you.
Help me!
Please!
Help me! I'm in the pit!
There's a snake down here and skeletons!
I warrant there'll be another one before long, a little spindly one.
- How do you like it?
- Help me.
- Please help me!
- You say you don't like it?
Baby sister!
Are you down there, sis?
- Yes! Hurry! I'm in a bad way.
- All right. Hold on. Hold on.
I'm going to pitch you a rope.
Now slip it under both arms and tie a good knot.
I can't. I'm caught, and my arm is broken.
There are snakes down here.
It's in here now!
Hang on right here.
Damn that Texan!
When you need him, he's dead!
I ain't dead yet, you bushwhacker.
Hang on.
I want Papa's gun.
- I want the other gold piece, too.
- Are you sure you don't want the snake?
No, but I do want that other gold piece.
- Forget the gold piece.
- But it's mine, and I want it.
That Texican saved my neck twice.
Once after he was dead.
We're going to have to do something about this snakebite in a hurry.
Let's get up.
Hold this arm up, little sister.
- We can't leave him like this.
- I'm the one that's leaving him.
If I don't get you a doctor, you're going to be deader than he is.
- Little Blackie cannot carry us both.
- He'll have to. He's all I could catch.
Stop it!
We must stop! He's played out.
Stop it! You're killing him.
Hold it!
Wing them guns into that creek.
I'm borrowing this wagon off of you.
Boots! Finch!
Boots!
Am I addressing
Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn?
You're addressing him, Chen Lee, and General Sterling Price.
Well, I'll not ask which is which but I'll identify myself.
I am Lawyer J. Noble Daggett.
- I'll be damned.
- What?
Well, you're not...
...exactly what we expected.
You're a little...
- You're shrunk.
- I'll tell you frankly, sir,
I fully intended to have you jailed, and I'm just the man who could do it, but when Mattie told me the straight of the matter,
I had second thoughts.
I still think you showed very poor judgment in this affair, but you're not the scoundrel I took you for.
You have my thanks and, with certain reservations, my respect.
How nice.
Well, how is sis?
Gravely ill, I'm afraid but still able to direct her affairs.
She commissioned me to pay you the balance of the $75 due in the matter of Tom Chaney.
- She didn't ask for a receipt, did she?
- Well, as a matter of fact, she did.
You'll find that it also covers an additional $200 for saving her life.
Well, I will be damned.
She says that when she goes home, she wants you to take her there.
Poor child, I fear, does not know how ill she really is.
Lawyer J. Noble Daggett, are you a betting man?
On occasion.
All of this and General Price that baby sister makes it back to Yell County.
Oh, no.
No, sir. No, sir.
I still don't see why you didn't look up
La Boeuf's girl when you were in Waco.
Well, I did the best I could.
I took the boy home to be buried in his Ranger suit.
No girl showed up.
I don't believe there was one.
I think you were too busy collecting a reward for Chaney.
Well, I was just a little busy.
Them Texicans forgot how much money they offered for a reward.
- I had to help them remember.
- I can imagine how you did that.
This is what I wanted you to see.
Papa's marker was not what was ordered.
I will make that wool-headed fool of a stoneman change it.
Someday, Mama will be here.
And my brother, Little Frank, and his family over there.
And that is for my sister Veronica and her family.
And I will be here, on the other side of Papa.
I think it's comforting to know where one will meet eternity, don't you?
I would like you to rest beside me, Rooster.
Now, sis, that place should be for your...
...your family, your husband, kids.
You have no kin.
I do not count Chen Lee and the cat.
Now where else would you end up, in some neglected patch of weeds?
Now I might just take you up on that offer, sis, if you'll excuse me if I don't move in too soon.
I think it's only right that you have Papa's gun.
- It might keep you alive.
- Well, I'm not so sure about that.
Almost got you killed when it misfired once.
That'd be 'cause you loaded it wrong when you were in a state of drunkenness.
Well, then I suppose
I ought to get you to show me how.
I will.
- Trust you to ride another tall horse.
- Yeah.
He's not as game as Bo, but Stonehill says he can jump a four-rail fence.
You're too old and too fat to be jumping horses.
Well, come to see a fat old man sometime.
Since there is no reconciliation, we proceed.
You will please stand with your backs to one another.
It may amuse you to know, monsieur,
I never believed you cheated at cards.
Maybe I don't have your sense of humour.
There's a lady who prefers your attentions to mine.
I intend to simplify her choice.
Rachel?
Margot? No.
When I begin to count, you will each take ten paces.
You will turn and fire on the count of ten.
If either man stops or turns before the count is complete, it will be my distasteful duty to shoot him down.
- Good luck.
- Thanks.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Fool. If he hadn't stepped aside,
I'd have hit him in the shoulder.
Many of us will be sorry to see you hang.
Hang? They've never enforced the laws against duelling before.
The son of Judge Beaubien has never been killed before.
Most certainly he will have you arrested and hanged before the week is out.
I'm sorry. It will take the incentive out of duelling.
I wouldn't wanna spoil it for the rest of you.
When one has proven himself on the field of honour, one cannot turn tail and run like a common criminal, can one?
One can.
Paul Regret, cabin 39.
Well?
I sent you to do an errand, Amelung.
He's registered as Paul Regret, cabin number 39. He has no luggage.
You could have met this handsome chap without sending me to snoop out his name.
I think you just want to humiliate me.
I'll not need either of you until morning.
13, black, odd. No winner.
- 23, please.
- 23 it is.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets, please.
Five outside.
Nine inside. The winner, nine.
Nobody there.
Place your bets, please.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
King outside.
Six inside. Winner six.
Guess it isn't your night, sir.
23, red and high. A winner!
Madame! Madame has won.
- Thank you.
- Pardon me, young lady.
But the one value of my white hair is that I may address beautiful women without being thought presumptuous.
Will you favour an old man with this waltz?
Thank you, but this dance is taken.
And here's the gentleman who has it.
Surely you remember we have this dance, Mr Regret?
I have a poor memory, but not for matters of utmost importance.
- Excuse us, sir.
- With envy, young man.
Thank you, Mr Regret.
You saved me from a dreary fate.
He is a darling, but I...
I am happy I was on the spot when you found yourself in such difficulty.
How did you know my name?
That was fortunate.
I heard the head waiter address you.
I dare say the salon will be full of cigar smoke and loud talk about the price of cotton.
Salons usually are at this hour.
Too bad. I would like a glass of wine.
May I suggest my cabin?
Frankly, I prefer my cabin.
Shall we say number 127 in half an hour?
It wasn't fair of me to come here.
- Fair?
- I'm not worth the effort.
I haven't been lucky at the tables.
What do you take me for?
A liar, to start with.
A beautiful liar, but a liar nevertheless.
No waiter has so far called me by my name.
I'm sorry, my dear.
But when the irate husband appears, you'll find the contents of my pocket not worth your trouble.
- You think me a blackmailer?
- Or whatever.
Whatever your game is, the trophy is not worth the chase.
- Look at my hand, please.
- It's very graceful.
The smallest stone in that ring could buy and sell you, Paul Regret.
Why should I want money from you?
Experience has taught me to look carefully at a gift horse.
Am I to believe you weighed, appraised and selected me out of all the men on the boat?
Do not be too conceited.
It's not a very large boat.
We certainly have picked a wonderful evening to fall in love.
Don't be ordinary. What passes between us tonight has nothing to do with love.
You don't believe that love exists?
I believe this very night, all over the world, men and women are saying to each other
"I love you" when what they really mean is "I desire you".
You are a very unusual woman.
It is unusual to be honest.
I like independent women, but I also want the right to be able to choose my own.
Mr Regret.
You like independent women and I admire men who can't be bought.
I think we've misjudged each other.
It's three days to Galveston.
Shall we start again?
To the beginning.
Wh... What?
$300 for a suit of clothes.
Where I come from, we could outfit 30 men for that.
- Who are you?
- The name's Cutter. Jake Cutter.
Cap'n Texas Rangers.
This tailor's gonna be mighty unhappy when he don't get his money.
Course, he'll get a lot of advertising.
You wearing that $300 suit onto the gallows.
- You can't do this.
- Well, now, let's see.
This here says Monsewer Paul Regret.
- That's Mr Paul Regret in English, ain't it?
- Yes.
- You're under arrest.
- I've committed no crime in Texas.
Right. But you killed a man in Louisiana.
I'm taking you to the ranger headquarters where a Louisiana marshal will pick you up, take you back to New Orleans and the gallows.
We're getting real obliging to the states down here in Texas.
A lot of folks want to join the Union.
There's a couple of hundred in gold in thatjacket.
Does that give you any ideas, friend?
I've got what you might consider a weakness.
I'm honest.
You start getting into that $300 suit.
And I ain't your friend.
Give me a minute to talk to someone.
It's very important. A girl.
Have a heart, friend.
I've been trying to explain to you that I ain't your friend.
But I don't want anyone to accuse me of not having a heart.
I'd like it if she didn't have to see these.
Hide 'em in that hat.
Oh, uh...
I wouldn't try any city-slicker stuff on this poor old country boy.
- Well, she's gone.
- Anybody can see that.
She said it was for ever.
Looks like country boys aren't the only ones who get lied to by gals.
I'll turn Galveston upside down. I'll find her.
You're sort of forgetting, Monsewer.
I got a prior claim.
Regret.
Monsewer Paul Regret.
- You say this trip'll take five days?
- Right. Step aboard.
- What, on this mule?
- On the mule.
- Riding him's gonna slow us down.
- Very sad.
But if you were to take off for the tall and uncut, I could run you down real easy.
- How we gonna eat?
- Ever been out in the fresh air?
A side of bacon, beans, a coffee pot and a frying pan?
- All the comforts of home.
- Yeah. All the comforts of home.
I'm beginning to hate this mule already.
He's got a mean look.
His name is Mabel.
Well, come on, Mabel.
Break out the coffee.
It's in your saddlebag.
Get it.
All right.
Unless you want this salt pork burned.
Captain Jake.
My friend, you're a very brave man.
And pretty soon you're gonna catch on I ain't your friend.
Captain Jake.
It's getting very tiresome lugging this saddle around.
I don't suppose you'd take my word of honour that I won't try to escape?
Monsewer, you are a lulu.
What do you find that's so interesting about this miserable country?
I used to own a cattle spread over there.
- You were a rancher?
- Yeah.
2,000 head of longhorn.
Indians run you out?
No. They weren't any trouble then.
Not till a few years ago.
Something's stirrin' them up now.
- The drought get you?
- My wife died.
Oh.
That's unfortunate.
So I gave the spread to some right nice people.
Folks that used to work for me.
Well, I personally could never see marriage.
Seems like a fella'd always feel that curiosity about the next woman he was going to meet.
Lots feel that way.
Did once myself.
Hold it.
That's an Indian sign.
You're gonna live a lot longer if you follow after me. Ya!
I expect we'll find the little girl inside.
Did you know these people?
Rode many a night herd with all of 'em.
I was at the baby's christening.
I guess that's about all we can do for 'em.
I hate to do this...
Hey, Jake, that's a pretty good-looking mount you got there.
(laughter)
Hi, Jake. You been horse-trading?
How come you're riding a mule?
Because I took to liking mules.
You got any objection?
- No, sir.
- Or you? Or you?
No, not me.
- Hello, Tobe. Major wanted to see me.
- He'll be right back.
Say, how do you spell "Louisiana"?
L-o-u-i...
- What do you wanna know for?
- I'm writing my pa a letter.
"Captain Jake went to pick up a prisoner wanted by the state of Louisiana".
"He came back with a mule and a split head and no prisoner".
I might have a "PS" for your pa.
"Dear Mulehead. We didn't beat this boy enough when he was growing up".
- Major.
- Hi, Jake.
- I got a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?
Yeah. Something that may prove that theory you've been bending our ears with.
- You mean a gang running the Comanches?
- Yeah.
Picked up a fella with a wagonload of guns.
Come on back here.
I'm sorry.
Between you and me,
I feel a sight better I was stopped.
Stopped before I went off and done some fool thing I might be ashamed of.
Like them guns. Wouldn't be right if they fell into the wrong hands.
Might even got to the Comanches
Now I look back on it,
I can see how bad it was.
That's how come that I give myself up.
Yup. After breaking one ranger's jaw and slicing up two others with a bowie knife.
I feel bad about that.
I wasn't using my head.
You used everything else.
Feet, fists and teeth.
Yes, sir.
But them rangers sure won me over.
If I'd have knowed men like that, I might never have fell in with bad companions.
Those are the fellas we wanna hear about, those bad companions.
And it's my Christian duty to tell you everything I know.
Which ain't nothin'.
Well, the truth is I ran into a man in Yuma.
He said I'd get the best price for my guns in Sweetwater.
Said if I'd go down to Sweetwater, check in a hotel, I'd be got in touch with.
But I never did find out who.
And that's the gospel truth.
You still don't know where you got those guns.
I've been beatin' my head tryin' to remember.
If I could only find that bill o' sale.
Those guns were stolen from the quartermaster depot on Fort Sill.
No! Well, then the man who sold 'em to me, he must have been mixed up in it.
If I'd have knowed that,
I sure would have reported it.
I think he's telling the truth about one thing.
It's the first time he brought guns into Texas.
And the last. Bless you for believing me, sir.
I believe you because I know where you spent the last five years.
- The Yuma Territorial Prison.
- Well, yes, sir.
But they had a right to lock me up.
I done a bad thing.
What with me not never having no schooling and knowing no better.
But now I'm all straightened out.
I been saved by the law.
Maybe the Comanche contact man won't know him by sight.
You want me to take his place? Take the guns to Sweetwater and meet the contact man?
Hey, that ain't a bad idea.
And you're sure welcome to use my name, sir. McBain. Ed McBain.
Maybe that'll make up some for the way I almost disgraced it.
Think of me being mixed up with them.
Me, who ain't never been in no trouble before.
- Well, not hardly.
- All right, McBain.
Just a minute. Might wanna do a little readin' tonight.
Either one of you gentlemen got an extra Bible?
Oh, sure, Mr McBain!
We been holding the room for ten days.
Never knew when you might be gettin' in.
- Reckon that'll cost me extra.
- Won't cost you nothin'.
- It's all been taken care of.
- Oh?
Yes, sir, Your friend says to tell you your money ain't no good.
Says anything you want's on him.
It's one of the best rooms in the house.
Says to stay tight, spraddle out, and you'll be got in touch with.
That's room 19.
That's right up on the first floor, sir.
That's right, sir.
- Am I in the right place?
- I guess so.
We were supposed to meet two gentlemen.
Well, ladies, you're halfway home.
Ed McBain at your service.
I'm Adabelle La Domergue and this is my friend Guadalupe.
Guadalupe Felipa Carmela López de Reyes.
- Fuzzy for short.
- Well, it's delightful to meet you, Fuzzy.
- Who provided the refreshments?
- I really don't know.
They were already here when we ladies arrived.
Well, a toast to him, anyway.
Mr McBain, I just want you to know that we don't usually go out on blind dates but...
(banging)
Oh, no.
I... I'm afraid we have a previous engagement.
Last time we had the pleasure of your company, we was involved in four fistfights, a stabbing and a shooting... and all before midnight!
Yee-ha!
McBain, what'd you do with them guns?
I tore your wagon apart and I didn't find 'em.
I found a false bottom but no guns.
- You got 'em or ain't you got 'em?
- I buried 'em.
You what? What kind of a sneakin' somethin' is that?
That is a damn distrustful way to start off a deal.
I didn't want 'em to fall into the wrong hands.
Well, you got me there.
But you're dealing with the right party now.
The name's Tully Crow.
You ain't done thatjug much damage.
Mind if I help myself?
- Go ahead.
- Snuff?
Cigar man.
(snorts)
Buried them guns, huh?
That was smart. Real inspitorial.
Six crates of rifles. Yeah.
You figured somebody mightjust take 'em on approval.
Could've cooked the goose that lays the golden eggs.
How's that?
If I hadn't made the right contact here,
I'd have to sell the rest of 'em someplace else.
- You got more?
- Steady supply.
Now that is somethin' I never knew.
So you can see how important it was to both of us to get started off right.
Yeah. I'll give you $100 for every gun you got.
I understand the Comanches pay five times that. What's this?
Leave that be. If I'd had that then,
I wouldn't have this now.
- You ever dealt with a Comanche direct?
- Can't say I have.
I did. They took everything
I had to sell and went after this.
What stopped 'em?
- Comancheros. Fellas I'm dealing with now.
- Comancheros?
That's right. Fellas with real fine connections with the Comanche.
They needed me.
I had a steady supply, just like you.
Only it ran out. So now
I'm willing to take on a partner.
When do we meet these Comancheros?
You don't. I do.
No good. I go where these guns go.
- Why?
- You're the only partner I got.
Or will have.
If anything happens to you,
I'm out of business.
That's right. So nothing better happen to me, huh, partner?
So wrap yourself around your half of this jug and we'll go out on this town and celebrate.
# Now the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing
# The breeze is sighing
# The night bird's crying
# Far away 'neath the stars
# Her love is sleeping
# While Red Wing's weeping
# Her heart away
How'd you like that, darling? Hearing my voice sound like a golden trumpet.
Come on, you swamp-toed jungle rat!
Let's get ajug up here.
All right, all right.
Don't get bored. I'm bringing it.
Not that stuff! The good stuff.
- This is the good stuff!
- You think me and my partner are blind?
Just walk slow, boys.
Go home to your firesides bright, huh?
- You shoot pretty good drunk.
- Better drunk than sober.
You know what the secret it?
Soothingness. That's right. Soothingness.
- You see something I don't see?
- No, sir. I don't see nothing.
- You're looking at my scalp, huh?
- No, sir. I ain't.
Well, I still got it, no thanks to you.
And right up here on top where it counts.
If you don't like it, you can do something about it.
I like it! Very much.
You like it very much?
Maybe I can fix yours the same way.
Beat it.
- What'd you do that for?
- Soothingness, partner.
- Good old McBain. Partners.
- Partners.
Share and share alike.
And by that crimson settin' sun
Peace come to Forest Glade
And of the redskins there was none
For history had been made.
Partner. You win.
You fight a good fight, Ed.
I gotta give you that.
A little quiet around here. Why don't you and me go someplace we can have some fun?
- Get a steak.
- Good idea.
# Oh, the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing
# On pretty Red Wing
# The breeze is sighing...
McBain.
I'm only as drunk as I wanna be, same as you.
Right, partner.
How we gonna round out the evenin'?
- Cigar?
- Thank you.
Why don't we dig up those guns and go sell 'em?
Not yet, McBain. Not yet.
We gotta grow on each other a little more, partner.
But I got one rule.
Never go to bed without making a profit.
Did you give any thought to that game back there?
Let's give it a try.
All right, men. Ante up, please.
Room for two more?
For more men and more money if you don't mind being separated.
I might as well warn you boys I'm a bad loser.
I'm Ed McBain.
- All right.
- Bill Kane.
- My name's Garth.
- And my name's Tully Crow.
And the name of the game is five-card stud.
Cough up the dues.
Cut the cards if you're a traveller.
Good luck to everybody.
See you.
- Three queens.
- You're sure lucky tonight, brother.
You can't keep from winning tonight, can you, partner?
They've been runnin' pretty good.
But not for me. Seems least a man can do is let his partner win one now and then.
- You couldn't win one if he let you.
- How is that?
- You play too wild, mister.
- Man's right.
- Luck ain't got a thing to do with cards.
- Not the way those cards was being dealt.
Now, you better do a little beggin' your pardon.
What for? I don't mind losin'.
I just like to have a run for my money.
- I'll give you your money back.
- Don't do me no favours.
Just try dealin' a hand straight next time around.
- No call for that kind of talk, mister.
- You better watch your step, brother.
Let's remember we're gentlemen.
Forget it. He's just spittin' out words to see where they splatter.
You think I miss much?
You think I didn't see that look you passed to this cold-footed, slippery-fingered gentleman on my right when you sat down?
How many partners you got in this game, partner?
That's whisky talking, Crow.
You know better than that.
Whisky don't muddle me none.
And you better remember that next time you run your thumb over them cards.
There ain't gonna be no next time.
I'm gettin' out.
- Give the change to the swabber.
- No, you ain't out. Not till I say so.
Time we both quit, Crow.
You don't like losing to me and I don't like winning from you.
Nobody's dropping out till I get my money back.
Mind a suggestion, friend?
The trouble is you don't enjoy the game for its own reward.
Stimulation, relaxation, pleasant association and the interesting conversation.
Shut your mouth.
Keep your seat. Don't cut in on this.
Crow, this isn't gonna get any better picking at it.
I don't want any quarrel with you.
We got a deal. That's more important.
And, like I said,
I'll give you your money back.
- But I'm walking out.
- You're gonna sit down.
You're gonna play poker.
It might take me longer to get it back that way, but you got time.
You took it quick enough.
We'll talk about that in the morning.
McBain, you try walkin' out on me now and see how far you get - deal or no deal.
You need me as much as I need you, Crow.
Give that some thought.
Self-defence, McBain.
My name ain't McBain, and you're under arrest.
Thanks for not giving me away, but... he's dead now. It doesn't matter.
How do you know you killed him?
There wasn't time not to. On your feet!
Give me that peashooter.
Unlock 'em.
I know you know how to handle one of these.
Dig.
- Dig what?
- A hole.
Don't worry. It's for takin' somethin' out.
You haven't asked why I use the name McBain.
Well, you're still a ranger, so you were working undercover.
Maybe you think you'd have been better off if you'd have just told Crow who I was.
Maybe.
Be glad you didn't.
Then I'd have killed you both.
Well, he made that easier than I would.
Yeah. He was fast.
Fairly.
Fill that up again.
What for?
You wouldn't want someone to fall in there and break their neck, would ya?
Fill it up.
# Oh, the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing
# On pretty Red Wing
(hums tune)
Well, it's not the moon shinin' out here.
It's the sun and it's hot. It's real hot.
Not back here. It's real cool.
Too bad there's not room for both of us.
If you'll permit me a statement.
This is very uncivilised.
Well, now, Monsewer, that's something nobody ever accused me of - being civilised.
Especially people who bend shovels over my head.
I presume you won't take my word of honour that I would behave if you permit me back in the wagon.
You presume right.
# Oh, the moon shines tonight on pretty Red Wing
# On pretty Red Wing
# Da da da-da da
McLain! Have the men roll up their blankets and saddle up.
We move out in ten minutes.
- Hello, Jake!
- Hello, Bender.
Whoa!
- Hi, Tobe.
- Captain Jake.
- Carson.
- Hi, Jake.
- What's all the ruckus about?
- About 200 Comanches on the Upper Brazos.
Ow!
Major Henry has a patrol out warning the ranchers.
- That thing hasn't healed up yet?
- Partly.
- It'll be all right.
- You can take it.
Who's that?
Monsewer, you haven't got the sense of ajack rabbit.
Letting hot horses drink. Keep 'em away from the water till they've cooled out.
- Don't you know anything about horses?
- I know enough about horses.
When I want one I call a groom.
When I'm done, I call a groom to take him and the groom says "Yes, sir, Mr Regret".
- That's all I wanna know about horses.
- You better cool off a little yourself.
I'm gonna let you founder if you want to, but not the horses.
Watch him.
- Hello, Bub.
- Hi, Mr Jake.
- Major.
- Hello, Jake.
I'm surprised to see you.
Who's your prisoner?
That's the fella that escaped.
The $300-suit fella.
- Uh-huh. How did you wind up with him?
- It's a long story, Major.
- Can we get in the shade?
- I don't know why not.
- Here's some fresh water for you.
- Oh, thanks.
That's sure some fancy shirt.
My ma's got one like that.
I never seen none on no man before.
Is this a ranger station?
You're sure ignorant! Ain't you never seen a grain ranch before?
- What are the rangers doing here?
- Chasing Comanches.
- Comanches? Indians?
- Sure. The worst kind.
Everybody knows that.
Everybody but you, seems like.
- How about Tobe?
- I'm leaving him with you.
I want him to rest his leg.
Say, Jake, uh...
Think you can talk Schofield into moving into town till this trouble's over?
- I'll do the best I can, Major.
- Thanks, Jake.
All right. Move out!
- Have you watered the horses yet?
- You told me not to.
But they've cooled out now.
Here.
Then I gotta feed you.
Miss Schofield's cooking's too good for you.
Miss Schofield's busy.
Starting to have a baby.
- Is that right?
- He'll have to eat Schofield's cooking.
- Hiya, Jake.
- Hello, Lem.
- Got a little grain for your team.
- Good. Feed 'em.
- I hear your missis is gonna have a baby.
- Pretty soon, I guess.
Great. With things the way they are, don't you think it'd be a good idea to get Martha out of here till the Indian trouble's over?
I'm going to but Martha's having the baby.
I wanted to get in as much grain as I could.
I've just been putting it off.
I got another problem.
I gotta feed this prisoner.
Come here. I don't want you cuffed to me and I don't wanna lose you.
I don't think you'll be too spry with this tucked under your arm.
It should hold him.
Let's get to the victuals.
Jim! Feed these horses, will you?
Martha! We've got company.
- Hello there, big Jake.
- Hello, Martha.
Sorry to be using your house at a time like this.
There's no one I'd rather have than you, Jake.
- Back again, Miss Schofield.
- You're always welcome, Tobe.
Jake.
That young fella with you.
What's that he's carrying under his arm?
Well, that's an anvil, Martha.
He's carrying an anvil.
Why ever would he wanna do that?
He's become attached to it, sort of.
Now, you get back to resting.
We'll make out.
Jake, it's so good to see you.
Pa! You make sure
Jake eats off the good china - the set him and Bess give us for our anniversary.
I will, Ma.
Seems like just the other day that you and Bess was sitting here, eating.
Time flies. How long is it since she's been gone, Jake?
About two years, ain't it?
Two years, two months, 13 days.
- You make yourself at home, young man.
- Thank you.
Set that anvil up here, Monsewer.
(screams)
Comanches!
- You got any rifles?
- In the corner.
Pretty good shooting for a handgun.
White men riding with Indians.
Comancheros.
That's what I've been trying to tell Major Henry.
Better get your head down, Jake, or you'll never tell him again.
- Looks like they're pulling out.
- Don't bet on it.
- How are you fixed for ammunition?
- I could use some.
- I need some.
- I'll see what I can do.
- Any more rifle shells?
- Top drawer, highboy.
Bub, keep that fire going!
Look out! They're regroupin'.
(whooping)
Looks like you lost him again, Jake.
(Tobe) Hold it.
You may need that ammunition.
Kind of surprised to see you back.
I'm kind of surprised I came back.
Looks like this little fracas is about over.
I'll take that gun now.
He didn't make it.
Jake.
I'm gonna take the responsibility and move all of these settlers out.
Everybody west of the Llano River.
I figure you'll wanna see that
Melinda and her daughter get out.
I planned to do that when I saw the size of this war party.
- Major, there's one other thing.
- Yeah?
Regret.
That's too bad. We owe him something.
But orders are orders.
I thought somebody could talk to Judge Breen.
- If there's a way, the judge'll know it.
- It'd help if you'd talk to him.
He doesn't take too kindly to me since I drew those fourjacks against his full house.
He just never was a good loser.
I'll be in Llano with the patrol three days from now, and I'll see you there.
Take a couple of horses and I'll bring your wagon.
- It's a boy, gentlemen! A boy!
- (Bub) Captain Jake!
New blood in the Schofield family!
He's as red as a lobster and fightin' mad, but he's a dandy.
We're gonna name him after you, Jake.
Cutter we'll call him. Cutter Schofield.
I appreciate the honour, but I think we ought to name him Regret after Monsewer here.
If it wasn't for the Monsewer, our scalps'd be dangling from some Comanche tepee and this little tad'd never grow up to lie about Texas.
Regret Schofield. Sounds nice.
May grow up to be president.
- You can take big odds against that.
- It's all settled.
Son, take Regret in to your mother.
Gentlemen, there's ajug in the wellhouse!
After what happened back at Schofield's, you making me a godfather, aren't you carrying this thing a little too far?
I feel bad about it, Monsewer.
If it was up to me, it'd be different.
Who else is it up to?
There's just you and I.
I've thought on it a lot.
Gave myself a lot of argument.
But I just can't do it.
"Let him make a run for it" I say to myself.
- Then what would you say?
- I'd say to myself "You can't let him run".
"You swore an oath when they put that badge on you".
- That's important to you?
- I said I swore an oath.
- Words.
- Monsewer, words are what men live by.
Words they say and mean.
You must have had a real careless upbringing.
However...
Now, please don't get any ideas.
Cos it'd break my heart did I have to put a bullet in your back.
It'd make me sad also.
You've been doing a lot of complaining about my cooking.
Get ready for the best meal in Texas.
Mommy! Mommy!
Look who's here. Uncle Jake.
- Uncle Jake!
- How are you, honey?
- Where's your mommy?
- There.
Oh, this is Monsewer Paul Regret, Bessie.
- How you doin'?
- Hi, Monsewer.
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello, Melinda.
I, uh... see that the fence has broken down again.
It only lasts from one of your visits to the next.
Well, I, uh...
Oh, this is Monsewer Paul Regret.
- How do you do?
- Mrs Marshall.
It's a pleasure to meet any friend of Jake's.
Well, thank you, ma'am.
My friend Jake here was telling me you're the best cook in Texas.
Isn't this a wonderful surprise, Mommy?
And I've got a surprise for you, Bessie.
You're going to pack your things and go into town with Uncle Jake.
There may be some visitors here that aren't as welcome as us.
- We'll be ready.
- Oh, uh...
Not until my friend here has tasted some real Texas cooking.
I hope I can live up to your bragging.
# Frère Jacques, frère Jacques
# Dormez-vous?
# Dormez-vous?
# Sonnez les matines
# Sonnez les matines
# Ding dang dong
# Ding dang dong
Listen, Mommy. We're singing in French.
Go get Mother the silver teapot that Uncle Jake gave us.
All right, Mommy.
# Frère Jacques...
- Bessie sings well.
- She gets that from her father, I guess.
He had a fine voice.
You said your husband was dead four years.
Was it Indians?
No. He was killed. The battle of San Jacinto.
When Texas won its independence?
The same shell burst hit my husband and Jake and Sam Houston.
- They were all standing together.
- President Sam Houston?
No, he wasn't president then.
That was before we were a republic.
Then Jake brought my husband's body home.
He made us move away from the frontier and take this place.
Your Bessie's named after Jake's wife.
We grew up together. Everybody was so surprised when she married Jake.
They were so different. He's so big and tough - at least on the outside.
And she was so tiny and so gentle.
But one never knows about those things.
They got along just fine.
Well, I better go inspect Bessie's progress.
- Captain Jake?
- Yeah?
Can you give me one good reason why you don't marry that woman?
Why don't you mind your own business?
I haven't got one good reason... that'd make sense to you.
Every time I quit to get married, that miserable, low-down silver-tongued
Houston starts bending my ear about how Texas needs every man and every gun, what with this Comanche and renegade trouble.
But duty and patriotism doesn't make sense to you.
- You think I'm simple-minded.
- Yes, I do think you're simple-minded.
Well, don't make a point of saying that too often. And once more'll be too often.
- But I envy you.
- You what?
Two women in one man's lifetime.
Yeah, I really do envy you.
I guess you're right. I'm God-given lucky.
It really happened to me.
At least I think it really happened to me.
I suppose I can't be too sure about it cos I just met the girl.
Well, it doesn't go by the calendar.
It either is or it isn't.
Time doesn't have much to do with it.
Yeah? Then it happened to me.
- Why'd you let her get away?
- Because a big ugly character with a star snapped some handcuffs on me and dragged me away.
- The woman at the boat?
- Yeah.
Well, I'm sorry, Monsewer. Real sorry.
Captain Jake, I believe you.
I actually believe that you're really sincerely sorry.
You've got a lot of Cupid in you but, I must admit,
Cupid picked a strange place to hide.
Monsewer, you may not live long enough to hang.
Your brougham awaits.
You go down and take care of the horses.
Remember I'm watching.
Ya!
- Take care of the team, will ya, Lem?
- Yes, sir.
Linda, this is a surprise.
- Hello, Jake.
- Hello, Mrs Breen.
- Looks like we'll be on your hands awhile.
- My, Bessie, how you have grown.
- Where's the judge?
- In his office with some rangers.
You better go in and get located.
We'll take care of this stuff later.
Think this friend of yours will be of much help?
I wouldn't hold out too much hope, Monsewer.
My conscience'll be clear. I'll have done all I could to keep you from gettin' hung.
Oh, great. As I drop through the trap, my last thought'll be
"Well, big Jake did all he could".
- Evenin', Jake.
- Judge.
- This is Monsewer Paul Regret.
- How do you do?
I'm Thadeus Jackson Breen.
Judge of the Texas Circuit Court.
Most say - except them that's unfair-minded - that I'm the finest legal mind in the entire Southwest.
So you can have faith in your lawyer, son.
- How much money you got?
- I don't have any.
I begin to doubt your chances against the law.
Judge, you're doing this one for nothing.
A workman is worthy of his hire.
Sure, but suppose these rangers start talking?
About where a certain Judge was during a ranger raid on a certain section of this town.
- I was advising a client.
- And a pretty one she was, too, Judge.
Seemed to be hangin' on every word you said.
See, Regret? We don't aim to just stand by and see a fellow fighting man go down.
Not without doing everything that we can for him.
- I don't understand.
- Major here's told me what your troubles are.
I've thought it over in the light of my
40 years' experience in legal jurisprudence, and I've come to the positive conclusion that there ain't no way to do this legal and honest.
But, being good, sensible Texans, we'll do her illegal and dishonest.
All the boys here in the room have agreed to sign a paper I've prepared.
We're gonna all commit perjury. That's legal language for a plain dumb-blasted lie.
Every man in this room's gonna swear that you are a member of the Texas Rangers, and have been for the last couple of years.
Ain't no possible chance you killed nobody in Louisiana.
Even Sam Houston himself wouldn't go up against the word of a dozen rangers.
So, my boy, you are a member of the finest underpaid organisation of men in the world.
- I don't know what to say.
- It's better than gettin' your neck stretched.
Well, thanks, men. It isn't only modesty that makes me doubt I'll make a good ranger.
If I had some money,
I'd buy you something to celebrate with.
Credit can be arranged.
My brother's saloon.
(all) Sure!
Honest Ben Breen.
- Jake.
- Yeah?
- Tobe insists he's the third man.
- Oh.
- I was born and raised in the Bend Country.
- You're only 18 years old.
At 18, you were the only white man south of the Pecos.
You told us till we were sick and tired of hearing how you settled up Pecos Country.
We get to be bores as we get older. He'll do.
Now, Tobe, keep this wagon in sight at all times.
- Let us know you're around.
- Don't worry.
I appreciate your volunteering, Regret.
Shows mighty fine spirit.
Good luck, men.
Did I volunteer for something?
You weren't handy. I knew you'd want me to speak up for you.
Jake, I often wonder what I ever did to deserve you.
Yee-ha!
I've often had every penny I own on the turn of a card, but never my life on a bundle of feathers.
- You claim to be a gambler, don't you?
- This may cure me permanently.
Our guardian angel's still on the job.
Why the mystery with the frying pan, sir?
Why does he have to stay out of sight - alone in the middle of 1,000 miles of this ugly Texas country.
Don't you bet on that, gambler.
An Indian speciality is not being seen.
Kick out the fire.
Cutter.
Put it away. They're tame.
- Tame? Tame Indians?
- Tame as dishwater.
(speaking in native language)
Well, I think we can afford one cigar.
Huh?
Oh, no. No whisky.
Tame Indians!
How do you tell the difference?
How do you know these from the wild ones?
It's pretty hard to explain to a city fella.
But you take like that snake there at your feet.
Don't shoot him, he's a gopher snake.
He's a friend. He eats mice and rats.
We'll put him in the shade.
You see those darker markings?
Crosspatch overlay?
Makes him look like a rattler, but you can see a thousand like that one.
And when you see your first rattlesnake, you'll know the difference.
You still haven't told me how you tell a Comanche from a tame Indian.
It's just like your first rattler.
One look and you'll know.
Come on. Get aboard.
Ya!
(Jake) Big country.
(Regret) Is this where we'll find the Comancheros?
You could hide the state of Louisiana here and never find 'em if they didn't want you to.
That's ourjob, findin' 'em.
Or lettin' them find us.
Well, old Tobe is still on the job.
You know, I'm tryin' to go along with your thinking.
But do you really believe that emblem will convince a Comanche that we're gunrunners?
- It had better.
- Yeah.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
Comanches!
He's alone.
I hope that Tobe isn't taking a nap.
Well, we're about to find out whether this passport'll work.
Comancheros! Comancheros! Rifles!
Comancheros!
I wish I had more practice at praying.
Comancheros! Comancheros!
Over here, my friends! Whisky!
Over here! Whisky! Here, whisky!
Over here, my friends.
Whisky!
You got a unique way of paying off your help around here.
Who's ramrodding this outfit?
You'll find out. What do you want?
Monsewer, break open that false wagon bed.
My name's McBain.
I got guns and I wanna do business.
72 rifles... just like this one.
Pass 'em out. Let the boys handle 'em.
Hold it!
You must be the boss man.
We brought 72 of these.
Just like this... except without firing pins.
Be useless to you unless you do business with us.
Your presence here has made me very happy.
Bastinado!
The pretty man from the boat.
It's gonna get awful thirsty around here.
Better think of a new plan, Jake.
This one didn't work out so well.
The hell it didn't.
We found the hide-out, didn't we?
Yeah. I wonder if they know how much trouble they're in.
Water.
Give me some water.
- Who ordered this?
- Amelung.
Cut them down and take care of them.
- Cut them down and care for them.
- This was orders.
I said cut them down!
Oh! The top of my head feels like an overdone pancake.
Say, you never did tell me what happened to me after I was knocked out.
Well, a handsome young woman on a horse came along.
She must have figured it was Saturday night and we needed a bath.
Pretty boy, hurry it up. We're waitin' for you.
I can do without the endearing words.
- We going somewhere?
- Trial.
- Trial?
- See whether you live or die. You'll die.
I always figured to die. Question is, when?
Just hurry it up.
You have broken a law of the society.
The penalty is death.
- Does the society approve?
- (shouting)
Don't kill them! I beg you! I beg you!
You may still wonder when, big man, but now you know how.
We go, my friends.
Got another one of those fellas uses that "my friend" stuff real careless.
(angry shouting)
Quiet! Quiet! Get back to your seats!
Be civilised, my people.
We have guests today.
There's work to be done.
Gentlemen, you come among us uninvited.
The penalty for that is death.
This society survives by its secrecy only.
You haven't violated that by entering here, but you could if you left here.
And it is our intention to see to it that this secrecy is never violated.
Now, as to this story of yours that you will bring us rifles without firing mechanisms, take out our money and return with other rifles, and the firing mechanisms of the first shipment...
I admit, it has the merit of being well thought out.
- You say your name is McBain?
- Ed McBain.
We know of a McBain. And it's told that this
McBain killed a man of ours in Sweetwater.
You mean Crow?
Fella with the half-scalped topknot?
- You killed him?
- Seemed like the thing to do at the moment.
It hardly surprises to me to hear that Crow got himself killed.
If his occupation didn't, his manner would.
Your name is Paul Regret?
(woman) That is his name.
His occupation is gambler.
- Pilar!
- We meet again.
I told you, sir.
That is the man she went back to search for.
Many wasted days trying to find him again.
He left New Orleans after killing a man.
The other man I don't know.
He killed Crow, which speaks well for his speed with a gun.
It doesn't give him the right to enter the place of our society or to live, after having discovered its whereabouts.
It is clear they know, so they die. It is a rule.
A rule you made many years ago and enforced many times.
It is of little concern to me what you do, though I say it would be intelligent to deal with them.
They offer us a continuing supply of up-to-date weapons instead of the few old-fashioned rifles we get from the South.
Do as you will. Just remember that you expect me to take over responsibilities.
Therefore I presume you would be willing to heed my opinion.
But if you prefer to placate that bloodthirsty mongrel of yours, then kill them.
I tell you, she has a personal interest in this man.
That is why she urges us to deal with him.
Amelung, you're a fool.
I've raised her never to let emotion cloud ajudgment, which is what you're doing at this moment.
Yourjealousy is apparent and it's warping yourjudgment.
That is all.
Bring those prisoners to my quarters!
- Esteban.
- Pilarcita.
Look over there. The taller of the two men.
Have you seen him before?
Galveston?
We were getting off the boat in the grey dawn, and he was boarding just as it docked.
Oh, yes. Now I remember.
You know, McBain, that plan of yours about the guns delights me.
It starts from the basic proposition that nobody is trustworthy.
We couldn't double-cross each other if we tried.
I can't wait to see the look on Amelung's face.
Don't get the idea that my reproof of Amelung indicates that I've adopted you two.
I must put him in his place now and then.
Help yourself to some wine.
What do you think of our place, McBain?
It took a lot of lookin' to find just such a layout.
I stumbled on it some 30-odd years ago. I was a different man physically, as you'll gather.
At that time, there was a motley collection of people dealing with the Indians.
I brought organisation to the business.
May I call your attention to the powder mill?
We make our own powder.
The nitrates come from our own mines, the saltpetre from deposits to the south.
You're a travelled man, Mr Regret.
What do you think of it?
Seems to lack nothing.
- You've done very well.
- I think so.
Lest you think all of this talk is the idle chatter of a broken chairbound man,
I tell you this for a reason.
We have a society here, a society that's different from anything visualised by people anywhere in the world.
The rules of this society are magnificently simple.
Transgress and you die.
Long and painfully. Look over there.
Not a pretty picture, is it?
A Chinese philosopher once said that a picture is worth a thousand words.
He stole. We, a society of thieves, cannot tolerate stealing from each other.
Take a long look over there and decide whether or not you intend to faithfully follow the rules of our society.
Gordo.
I'll send for you in due time.
I'll bet that old boy was a man to stand aside from when he was young and limber.
Right now, if he took a dislike to you, you could get yourself killed in a hurry.
What bothers me is finding that girl here.
- Where do you know her from?
- I know her - or knew her briefly.
Briefly? You must have made quite a dent.
She seems to favour us staying alive, or at least you.
That was the girl on the boat.
Oh.
We got ourselves two problems.
But the first one's to stay alive.
Toward dark, Major Henry and the boys are gonna come over that hill and we'd better have a place to fight from.
- Fight with what?
- Naturally, when the war breaks out, we're gonnajump a couple of these gentlemen and borrow their guns.
Well, naturally. So natural that I overlooked it.
You take off the road in this direction, and keep your eyes peeled.
- I'll go the other way.
- All right.
Miss Graile?
This is the first chance I've had to thank you for getting us out of the sun.
- You're welcome.
- In a way, I feel I don't owe you any thanks.
If it weren't for that good-looking fella, by now I'd be approaching the well-done.
- How long have you known Paul Regret?
- Off and on for quite a while.
I'm beginning to doubt if it was wise to save him. From now on, he'll be insufferable.
You're not exactly making yourself clear.
That fool Amelung had to shout
I went searching for Paul.
Now he'll be so sure of me, he'll be impossible to manage... Or so he thinks.
But I shall find the opportunity to teach him otherwise.
(chuckles)
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just... glad that I'm not your age or Regret's.
I went through all that.
Me and my wife used to fight like a couple of wildcats with only one tree between us.
But you soon find out that it doesn't make a tinker's damn who's got the upper hand.
A few years roll by and you kinda settle down to being at ease with each other.
Then life gets worth living.
In every relationship between human beings, one is dominant and one is subservient.
The way you make it sound, life'd be one long war.
- Isn't it?
- Missy, you got a lot of surprise coming.
Some good, some bad.
Mr McBain!
Speaking of surprises,
Mr McBain, there's something...
(screaming)
(gunshots)
(speaks in native language)
- Is that Chief Iron Shirt?
- Yes.
Now we'll have a celebration.
All of his visits call for one.
First time I've ever seen him in the flesh.
Mr McBain, I might enjoy prolonging this conversation with you but for one thing.
Your name. Naturally, it's not McBain.
Well, a man in my business uses many names;
- Just what is your business?
- At the moment, I'm a gunrunner.
Three weeks ago, as I was getting off the boat in Galveston, you went aboard.
You wore a Texas Rangers star on your shirt.
You're poised, Mr, uh... whatever your name is.
What for? Flight?
Where could you go?
To fight? You are unarmed and there are hundreds of us.
You're the coolest character I ever met.
(gunshots continue)
What happens now?
I don't know.
Hello, Pilar.
Women. How can you figure 'em?
She's been chasin' me for three weeks.
- Saves my life and now she won't talk to me.
- Saved my life, too.
I don't think you better put that girl in a class with any of the other girls you've known.
She'll never act the way you figure.
As a matter of fact, I wish I knew how she was gonna act about a certain little matter.
She knows I'm a ranger.
Told me so in no uncertain terms.
We better get to that corral and get us some horses.
Try to make it to the top?
What chance'd we have?
- Not much...
- No chance at all.
- We can jump those Comancheros...
- Monsewer, you've changed.
I thought you were the fella that took care of number one.
Well, I've gotten used to you.
We'll just sit tight. The girl's got a problem.
She points her finger at me and hollers "Ranger", your head goes too.
She seems to put quite a value on you.
So we'll just hold on for a few hours and give Tobe a chance.
If they keep this up, they'll save the rangers the trouble. Probably kill themselves all off.
Paul.
Paul, there's some...
I've been wanting to do that for a long time.
Paul, there's something I've got to tell you.
Pilar.
I hope I'm not intruding.
Mr McBain!
I'd like to invite you to join us for dinner tonight.
I suppose that good manners force me to include your romantically inclined friend.
You'll find she has a mind of her own.
Gordo.
After sundown on the terrace.
It looks like the condemned men'll eat a hearty dinner.
Let's go. Move out!
Gracias, señor.
Esteban! 300 more for him.
Oh, gentlemen. If you'll excuse me for about ten minutes. Business.
Gordo, give them some refreshments.
- Don't mind me.
- I'm glad you're here.
I've been trying to tell you all day.
Your friend has one chance.
A horse and provisions for you will be waiting by the stairs.
You can escape sometime tonight.
- Will there be a gun in the saddle?
- Don't make conditions.
How naive do you think we are?
If he's followed, he'll never make it to the top of the rim.
- You refuse to accept my plan?
- Well...
Shut up. Keep losing your patience and then we'll find out what happens next.
All right. I've done all I can.
You're on your own.
So. Unless I let your man kill him, and stay here with you like a maquereau...
- That's French...
- I know what it means, mon cher ami.
It's pretty obvious that you feel I'm unique.
Oh, your modesty is your most appealing quality.
You backtracked trying to find me again.
And I feel the same way about you.
We can't stay here together. You can't stay in Texas, being wanted by the authorities.
So we'll go somewhere else.
Anywhere else. Just you and me.
How do I know you're not lying?
You don't. There's no way you can prove that I'm not lying.
Every time a man and a woman talk like this to each other, neither can prove to themselves that they aren't being lied to.
Pilar, what all this adds up to is that I love you.
And there's no way you can tell whether I'm not lying.
You believe or don't believe.
Good evening, friend.
Excuse me, Pilarcita.
I've been told to have the wagon brought here at dawn so that these two men may leave.
But I'll bring it myself so there's no mistakes.
Thank you, Esteban.
- Viejo?
- Yeah?
How about a light?
El grande mucho.
- Muchísimas gracias.
- De nada.
(speaks in native language)
You must give me your opinion about the wine we're having.
Our own grapes, you know.
Oh, it would be a shame to have our guest of honour drown in a plate of soup.
Gentlemen, you must forgive the noble chief.
His semi-annual visits are a great occasion.
- Papa.
- Yes?
I'm leaving here for ever.
I'm going away with Paul.
This is no life for me and this is no place for you.
How frail is human judgment, particularly the female's.
It would be common sense to pick the big ugly one and not the handsome one.
He has definite indications of character in his face.
That big nose that someone broke at one time, the scars above the eyebrows all show that at one time he has enforced, or tried to enforce, his will upon others.
Obviously a man of great determination.
Thank you, Mr Graile. Compliments are always welcome, no matter what the source.
- A wonderful man!
- Papa, stop this!
I'm in no mood.
I'm leaving and I wish you would leave, too.
Iron Shirt can get you to the south and from there, the world is wide.
You can go where you choose.
Why should I die in a place other than the one I made for myself?
- Why are you so anxious that I leave?
- This place is no longer safe.
The authorities know its location.
I'm afraid the noble chief may not rejoin us.
He inherited that armour from his grandfather who fought the Conquistadores.
I leap to the conclusion that you are the authorities.
I was afraid that the little lady's remark would spill the beans.
Now, Papa, in a very short time, a company of rangers is gonna come boiling in here, and you'll hurry your end if you don't behave.
Mr McBain, you're introducing a discordant note here.
He followed these two.
They signalled back and forth.
Ah, what a shame.
It looks like company's not coming.
Mr McBain, would you mind handing over your pistol?
Monsewer... charge.
(mumbles drunkenly)
What's your story? Saving bullets?
Couldn't afford the sound of a shot.
- You looked to be doing all right.
- For a while there, it was even money.
- Now, Papa...
- Not quite, Mr McBain.
Gordo!
Well, get him off me!
- Is that a closet?
- Yes.
Keep a lookout on the terrace.
My daughter forgets that in the eyes of Texas justice, she may not be an innocent party.
You know the oath you put so much faith in, the words men live by?
Make up your mind to this. When we get over the top o' the rim, we're partin' company.
You can take him north, but she and I are goin' south.
- Mexico?
- For a start.
There's 1,000 miles of Indian territory.
Apache and Yaqui.
I figure she's worth it.
You made it, Monsewer! That's love.
(Graile) You're all fools.
(Jake) But it's fun sometimes, particularly when you're their age.
You really think you'll make it, huh?
You ordered the wagon.
And now, Papa, we'll just sit quietly and wait.
He was only 18 years old.
I'm going to take particular delight in seeing you hang.
(cock crows)
(snoring)
Esteban, I ask you to endure great risk for me.
Esteban, make your choice.
All trussed up like a pigeon ready for market.
Bring those rifles and cartridges.
Yahoo! Comanchero!
Comanchero! Comanchero!
(Graile continues yelling)
Charge, Monsewer!
(gunshots)
(gunshots)
Hand me that lantern!
Look!
Paul!
Yah, it's the rangers!
The best in Texas! Ha-ha!
Load this.
Well, Monsewer.
Looks like I've lost you again.
Mr McBain, or whatever your name is, we'll miss you.
We've kind of gotten used to you.
Big Jake! Don't forget to mend those fences.

ENGLISH SDH
In every war... In every age...
The forgotten weapon is...
...Food. For to kill, soldiers must live...
...to live, they must eat.
And a herd of cattle is...
...as vital as a herd of cannon.
The United States in 1864.
Hey, we made it, amigos!
Whenever you're ready to talk business,
Kelly, I'll be at my hotel.
- You're Steadman.
- Major Steadman.
Major Steadman.
Sorry.
Major, I've got the most marvellous beef in the world for you.
The best beef in all of Mexico.
No, Sanchez?
They're a little thin by now, but it's been a long walk.
- A few days in the pasture...
- You are late, Mr. Kelly.
Ten days late. Ten miserable days in this stinking, hot town.
Is it Vermont or Massachusetts?
I'm from Boston...
...which, may I tell you, is one long way from this prairie rat hole.
Well, there are certain compensations, major, in a railroad town.
I was hoping that you brought a couple of them along.
I see.
I don't happen to be a procurer, Mr. Kelly.
Forgive me.
Whiskey or sherry?
I'm here on business, Mr. Kelly.
United States Army business.
I'm waiting for an explanation.
What were you in civilian life?
A lawyer. I want an explanation.
Lawyer, huh?
- You've never driven cattle?
- Hardly.
Hardly.
Three months, major. Not ten days.
Three months, staring into the rear ends of those beeves.
Smelling their stink, choking on their dust...
...listening to their damn bellowing night and day.
I'm a reasonable man.
If I weren't...
...I might go over to the other side and see how their manners are.
You'd do business with the Confederates?
No.
Their money's no good.
Kelly.
What's he doing?
If I'm not mistaken, someone's stealing my wine.
I thought you were a soldier, not a sheriff.
You like my wine, Paco?
I like it if you do, huh?
Costs five dollars a bottle.
That's ten dollars out of your pay.
Since you're a generous man, share the rest with your friends here.
I don't understand you.
I don't understand you at all.
A thief should be punished.
We'll have dinner now.
And take a few more bottles of wine out to our friends.
He's a lonely thief, Steadman...
...trying to celebrate after a rough journey.
He'll be happy to go home.
They all will.
And so will I.
I'm afraid you won't be going home quite yet, Mr. Kelly.
There's been a change.
Take the cattle by rail to Virginia.
Deliver them to a plantation near Richmond. The pasture is there.
You'll be paid on arrival.
That's not in the agreement.
I was ordered to bring the cattle here.
The war's going into a new phase.
We're concentrating on Richmond.
And when we take it, we've won.
I don't care who wins.
You want that herd in Virginia?
It'll cost you five dollars per head extra.
I'm authorized to pay you one dollar a head extra. Not a penny more.
That's not Army beef yet, major.
Not until I get paid off on my contract.
The contract specifies, in rather small print, I'll admit:
" Payment shall be made when the beef is delivered to the area...
...deemed most urgent by the commanding general."
Which is 30 miles south of Richmond.
It's in order. I prepared it myself.
Even specifying the size of the print.
Now those steers are going east, Mr. Kelly.
Oh, by Godfrey, that judge.
He thought he had me licked.
Licked, Kelly.
But he underestimated the man he was dealing with.
I hit that judge...
I hit him with a writ of certiorari.
It's like a brilliant bolt out of the black, a tiger springing.
A writ of certiorari!
Play cards, Steadman.
Thousands of them.
The boys in blue are gonna eat beef tonight.
And tomorrow and next month.
Till it's coming out of their craws.
Maybe it's our stomachs making us see what ain't there.
Colonel, how about me going and bringing back proof.
Just to make it official.
My orders are to scout that herd.
Go ahead.
Just make sure the Yanks don't scout me.
Oh, Lord.
This is always embarrassing.
I'm sure you'll handle it with your customary tact.
- Take over, captain.
- Yes, sir.
Major Steadman, ma'am.
I'm Charity Warwick.
This is Alvarez Kelly, who brought the cattle here.
I was ordered to arrange quarters for the two of you.
Your men can camp in the field below the house.
Mr. Kelly, the grazing is best in the north pasture.
You may eat in my dining room tonight, major.
But from tomorrow on, you'll make other arrangements.
Mrs. Warwick...
...will you join us for dinner?
Nice try, but I don't think...
She's a lady, Kelly.
A great lady.
One rarely has the privilege to meet such a...
What does that mean?
Woman.
- Pick up those strays.
- I'll get them.
Go get that meat!
Sir?
Cleet Warwick must be rolling around in his grave.
I'll bet this is the first time his place...
...has been lit up like that since Manassas.
- Eat while it's hot.
- The man who brought the cattle.
- Colonel, I promise you...
- That man really knew his business.
Moved that herd like it was a column of infantry.
That's prime beef, Johnny.
And there's enough down there to feed a lot of people...
...who haven't chewed on meat in a long, long time.
Thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty.
Now with the $10,000 advance paid to you in Mexico...
...it makes it a total of $50,000 and completes our original contract.
Plus the...
...additional $2500.
Just sign here.
- Buying beef at three dollars a head.
- Two.
- And selling them for 20.
- Not bad.
It's outrageous.
You go to some nice place to count your profits?
I spend it, Steadman.
I spend it and enjoy it.
And when it's all gone, raise it again.
You make it sound simple.
It is, if you don't want it too bad.
Money, whiskey and women.
Your three deities.
Tell me something, Mr. Kelly:
Have they made you a happy man?
No.
But not as miserable a one as you.
Mrs. Warwick.
Dinner is served, gentlemen.
How nice. You changed your mind.
A lady's privilege.
Your privilege is our pleasure, ma'am.
I got hungry.
Driving thousands of half-wild animals across thousands of miles.
For someone brought up in these parts, it seems impossible.
I have such respect for special knowledge.
It's nothing.
You certainly know how to charge for it.
Do you object to making money,
Miss Charity?
In wartime? I think so.
Making money out of war.
It's almost an act of nature.
Do you have any idea what a major's salary is?
I wasn't talking about that.
What about a colone"s salary?
And the prestige afterward?
You'll carry that rank into every courtroom for life.
- I didn't go to war for that.
- No, but you'll use it.
Every man, in his own special way, takes care of number one.
I don't admire men like that, Mr. Kelly.
Mrs. Warwick...
...if there were a kind of profit driven right into your own back yard...
...would there be any reason not to take advantage of it?
What do you mean by that?
I would say it's a matter of the north pasture.
The north... You're talking in riddles.
To you, ma'am?
I don't understand.
I was curious.
When Mrs. Warwick specified the north pasture, I wanted to know why.
The soil, major, is overworked.
Dying for the lack of fertilizer.
- Well, yes, but I still don't...
- Manure, major.
I didn't know you were a farmer.
I was raised on a farm.
My father's estancia in Texas.
Estancia. What a lovely word.
So is caridad.
Charity.
Yes, it was lovely.
It was lovely and big.
Open.
Fifty families lived on it.
My father was like a lord.
Like an Irish lord.
Yet this virtuous Irish lord...
...was not quite able to stop his son from turning pirate, was he?
Make jokes, Steadman, about the war, about God, and about me.
But don't make jokes about my father.
He was killed defending our home.
Mexican War, I think you called it.
We had other names for the theft of a piece of our country.
The officers wore the same uniform you have on.
Only some of them now have changed it to grey.
So I say, "Alvarez Kelly..."
...take what you can from both sides.
Small return for your birthright."
- Beg pardon, ma'am.
- What is it?
A guard found one of our drovers...
- ...beaten and unconscious.
- We're 30 miles behind the lines!
They butchered a steer inside the gates.
Where the hell were the sentries?
Excuse me.
All right, let's go.
The poor major.
He finds duty more fascinating than...
...pleasure.
Do you undress every woman you meet?
There has to be some beauty.
Then it's no special compliment.
Being a beautiful woman is compliment enough.
From what you've said about your father's estancia...
...it must have been something like it was here before the war.
Very much like it.
Might be interesting to buy some land around here.
Not to help rebuild, though. Not to live.
- Just to buy cheap and sell dear.
- It's a nuisance the other way around.
You disappoint me, Mr. Kelly.
After what happened to you, I should think you'd sympathize with us.
I have no sympathies, only instincts.
And they shy away from losers.
I'm overstaying my welcome.
You must be tired.
You underestimate yourself, Mr. Kelly.
Rarely.
Thank you for the evening.
How long since you've been with a woman?
Three months.
A lifetime.
My husband's been dead three years.
There was someone under the bed all the time.
Hatcher.
The money.
I got just as many men outside.
I warn you, I'm a Mexican national.
Doing business with the Yanks.
- My privilege.
- Grazer!
The money.
Obliged, Mr. Kelly.
Just how far would you have gone?
You bastards couldn't have waited a while longer.
Hatcher.
Good night, Charity.
God bless.
Take care, Tom. God bless.
God bless, Charity.
Bless.
Oh, Mrs. Warwick.
Good night and God bless.
Yes?
Major Steadman.
- Yes, major?
- You had visitors.
Old friends of mine.
Old, dear friends.
And why did they take Kelly?
For the money, wouldn't you say?
They didn't have to kidnap him to get his money.
Perhaps they didn't want to shoot him in front of me.
Shoot him? For what?
The way they see it, he committed an act of war against the Confederacy.
Of course, they're prejudiced.
Mrs. Warwick...
...did you know about this?
Of course! I saw it happen.
No, I mean beforehand.
I mean aiding and abetting.
Oh, that difficult lawyer talk, major.
Mr. Kelly was certainly right.
Alvarez Kelly hijacked by rebels.
You appreciate that, major?
Mrs. Warwick.
- Beaurider.
- Yes, sir.
Get back to camp fast as you can.
Straight back. We've had our enjoyment for the evening.
Yes, sir.
Turn them around, boys!
Now that that's over, would you mind telling me what this is all about?
Not yet. Get in.
- Tell him to keep his hands off me.
- Get in.
I may choose not to.
You may choose to die too.
You'd give up those stripes for that privilege, wouldn't you, sergeant?
As long as you knew my hands were tied.
Rossiter, we both know you didn't bring me this far to shoot me.
For some reason, you want me alive and in one piece. Why?
You know, Mr. Kelly, you talk too much. Get in.
I'd like to tell you a little something.
This river winds all the way to Richmond.
Now, if I was to put you to sleep...
...you'd miss some of the prettiest scenery in all of Virginia.
Colonel, in my inside pocket, where my money used to be...
...there's a cigar.
You could get it for me.
Or better yet...
...I could get it for myself.
Bust him, colonel, sir!
Make him shut his big mouth.
Confederate man-of-war?
Kelly, we've got to have that beef.
The army and the whole South is starving.
- That's your problem, not mine.
- Damn it!
If hungry people don't mean anything to you, this should!
That already belongs to me.
We'll double it.
In gold, colonel?
Are you suggesting our currency is no good, sir?
Can I tell you what for?
Colonel, I have to hand it to you.
You're not just half-mad.
How do you figure you're going to get 2500 head of cattle...
...over Grant's lines? By balloon?
Nope. We don't have that many balloons.
All right, we can't get over them.
But we can go around.
We can make this big circle.
Come up behind the plantation.
Then we just shoo those cattle back the way we came.
- Just "shoo" them back?
- That's right.
You know there's a small army guarding those steers.
Don't you expect a fight?
I'll handle the military.
You handle the herd.
- Fair division.
- Then you'll do it?
Mr. Harrison, I intend to die in bed, in the arms of a beautiful woman.
We all share that wish, sir.
I do not intend to die from a Yankee bullet.
So I say the hell with it, colonel.
You're not walking out of here.
This city is swarming with spies, and you know our plan.
Worth nothing.
You couldn't even try it without me.
Oh, look at the soldier boy!
Morning.
Morning.
Enjoying yourself?
Oh, yes.
I like cockroaches with my soup.
Specialty of the house.
You about ready to leave?
Not under your terms.
- But I've got some advice for you.
- Yeah? What's that?
Nobody's even gonna start to move that herd out without drovers.
- My Comanches can handle it.
- Cavalry?
Top riders. Fought under Jeb Stuart.
Any Texans among them? Cowhands?
They're Virginians.
And there's no damn thing anybody can do on a horse they can't match.
No, except maybe drive a cow out of a closet.
Takes a long time to train a drover.
Jailer!
Open up.
Mr. Kelly, your education has been sadly neglected.
Not bad.
But you're not charging the enemy.
You're pushing cattle.
For that, you need trained cowboys.
- Now look...
- These is warhorses, mister.
I reckon they can handle them little old cows.
All right, lieutenant.
Take your warhorses and push those little old cows into that back corral.
With your permission, colonel?
Move, cow.
Come on, cows! Get in there!
You darn fool cows, get in there!
Come on, get in there!
You darn fool cows, get in there!
Colonel, where the hell you get these cows? From an old ladies' home?
Move them out!
Get on! Get out of here! Get out of here!
All right, you darn fool cow!
Come on!
Get out of my way! Go on! Move along there!
Watch out!
- Sound retreat.
- What's that, sir?
- I said sound retreat!
- Yes, sir.
Close the gate.
Get those cattle! Go on, get them.
Now, listen:
There are 2500 head of Mexican range-bred steers on that plantation...
...stupid, temperamental and a lot more vicious than anything you've got here.
All right, so we got plenty to learn.
But you can train us.
Damn you, Kelly, you're gonna train us!
Back to jail.
Are you coming in or am I going out?
General Lee has approved the raid.
That makes you the only missing link.
Missing's the word.
That's a lot of cash to carry around, colonel. It'd be safer in a bank.
Matter of fact, I'll give you permission to open an account in...
They'll be butchering and eating that herd before long.
I figure you've got no more than ten days to get us ready.
Burn it all.
Ten days before we start.
God deliver me from dedicated men.
Ten days.
You used to have ten fingers.
Now you got nine.
Tomorrow, you'll have eight.
You stay stubborn, the day after that, you'll have seven.
The day after that...
...it's up to you.
You decide whether you want to end up with a pair of stumps...
...or lend us your talent.
You decide.
Get a doctor.
Don't split them up like that. Get them.
All right, get those back.
Get them together.
He drives hard, I'm glad to say.
Don't split them up! Slow down there!
Take it easy with them.
I deplore what happened, colonel.
- However, under the circumstances...
- It was necessary.
Still, there's a time for sandpaper and a time for silk.
From now on, I think we'd be wise to cater to his taste.
I want to borrow a hat.
- Tool of the trade.
- Will mine do?
Mr. Kelly, I'd be honoured if you'd accept the hospitality of my home...
...for the remainder of your visit.
I believe you'd find the accommodations more cheerful...
...than your present quarters.
- And the bourbon?
- More plentiful.
You gentlemen have a way of making it hard for me to refuse.
Who am I?
You're a rich land speculator looking for bargains.
Seems to me I heard you mention something like that...
...recently.
Satisfactory?
Yes, yes, that would go down well with anyone who was curious.
Mrs. Townsend is having a soiree next week. Nothing pretentious.
No, certainly not.
Not in starving Richmond.
I can't offer you a clean shirt...
...but we'll take care of the one you got.
That's thoughtful.
Now watch this.
Slow down.
When he moves to your house...
...one of my men goes with him.
Naturally.
Oh, Mr. Kelly, I couldn't.
I'd love to, but I just couldn't.
- I'm spoken for.
- Loudly?
By a seafaring monster who can shrivel a girl right up.
Where's he?
Very impressive.
Since you and I are only going to be friends...
...it's only fair that you turn me over to her.
Liz Pickering?
You're really running in luck tonight.
- Married?
- Engaged.
It's not the same, is it?
I bet you could tell me, if you really wanted to.
Military secret.
- Damn the military and their secrets.
- Come on.
I suppose it's very dangerous.
Not as dangerous as you.
The way you look tonight, you could start pandemonium in the streets.
And that perfume...
But you do prefer horse sweat.
Oh, Tommy, I'm sorry, but I see you so seldom.
You know, that's what
I hate most about the Yanks.
They keep us apart.
I understand married officers have more leave than single ones.
But what if one of those nasty old Yanks...
...threw a speck of dust in my other eye?
How would you look leading a blind man down the street?
As foolish as you sound talking about it.
Thank you.
Who's he?
Rich businessman from Mexico.
Friend of the Harrisons.
But not a friend of yours?
No.
Tom, what's the matter?
I don't know.
I guess the war's the matter.
War's the matter with all of us.
Mr. Kelly, this is
Captain Angus Ferguson of Glasgow.
- Captain.
- Isn't he magnificent?
Aye, it's good when they adore you, especially when they're half your age.
Or could it be the wee gifts
I bring her in my ship?
The French perfumes and silk nighties?
- Let's dance.
- I'm not used to a ballroom.
There are many stout lads to stretch your muscles.
If you don't put your arm around me now, I'll take you up on that.
I will dance the whole night through with you in my rooms.
Angus, you're a devil.
No use telling her it's my farewell night, is there?
Not till morning, that is.
Which one of you will help me make an old sea dog jealous?
Tom.
Rank does have its responsibilities.
Go ahead, darling.
So I weigh anchor tomorrow evening, courtesy of Secretary Harrison.
After four months wait and a good deal more effort...
...than a Scotsman cares to spend.
For mercy sakes, no, Mr. Kelly.
That stuff there will distemper a whale.
Here, you take a taste of this.
Blessed nectar from Scotland.
Will you believe it, there are
1000 bottles of that aboard my ship?
Sounds like paradise.
I was commissioned to run it in here, but then I found...
Confederate money isn't worth the match to burn it with.
Aye, so I'll take it to New York.
Heavens, Mr. Kelly, don't tell me the currency there is still wampum.
Mr. Kelly, you have my flask!
If I may suggest, Miss Pickering, the punch is pale.
This will improve the colour.
You're gallant enough to be a Virginian.
And your beauty goes beyond the bounds of geography.
I'm Alvarez Kelly.
And you've learned my name and a few particulars.
Only one.
You've shortchanged yourself.
You could remedy that.
Are you any kind of gambler, Kelly?
I've lost my last few bets.
Will you come to my house?
I need some advice that can't very well be given here.
What time?
Midnight, number 19, Royall Street.
Make sure there's no carriage outside.
Why, Mr. Kelly, whatever happened to your hand?
One of the bets I lost.
Darling, I think he's rather charming.
Yeah.
- You understand?
- Playing with fire, aren't you, lad?
It's not my house.
Now, follow me.
With all of the beautiful women that were here tonight...
...the result is
I don't feel much like sleeping.
You know what I mean?
I don't know how to put it to your delicate ears, but in Richmond there...
There must be a house of joy.
There's a few.
Now, let me guess what your orders were.
Let him do what he wants...
...but don't let him out of your sight. Right?
Well, let's be off. Two men of the world.
You ever seen him before?
No, but I wish I had.
Kelly, you might not like these women.
I understand that the Mexicans like their women fat and dumpy.
Relax, Hatcher, you can't make me angry tonight.
What part of Mexico, amigo?
Durango, amigo.
You lonely?
Not really.
Friendly?
Not very.
Thirsty?
Not especially.
You're the one I want.
A bottle of your best wine.
- This is where I draw the line.
- I'll wait.
May take all night.
Should I take it off?
The wedding ring.
Some like it on, some like it off.
You men are peculiar.
What do you do in case of fire?
I don't know, we never had one.
Well, suppose you had one right now.
There's a window with a big, old wisteria vine right by it.
Show me.
Now, look, I want you to stay here all night...
...and improve your mind.
Your body's already perfect.
Come in, sir.
Miss Pickering will be down in a minute, sir.
My Japanese room. Uncluttered.
Does she have to stay here?
You can go to bed now, Ellie.
Why, Kelly, whatever are you thinking of?
I was thinking there might be...
...some chimney sweeps up there in grey uniforms.
I've grown to expect anything from Southern belles.
I'm not a Southern belle.
I'm Liz Pickering.
This house was something quite special in its day.
Sorry you couldn't have seen it.
Used to be a lovely miniature over the mantle.
Till last week. It paid for the gown I wore this evening.
I don't know why you asked me here, but it was not to pity you.
Hardly. Pity is the real empty room I despise.
I amuse you, Kelly?
It's too early to tell.
Well, we're getting older by the minute.
Would you like to drink that where it's more comfortable?
Whatever your friend's got, he ought to market it, huh?
Well, good night.
Wherever did you get wine at this time of night?
Ask me no questions.
Haven't tasted anything so good since the war began.
You should've seen that too, Kelly.
It was grand.
That was the year Tom Rossiter and I became engaged.
The year the boys went off singing.
I begged Tommy to marry me.
It wasn't very ladylike, but I begged him.
I loved him so much.
But he was noble, he had principal.
Said he couldn't risk leaving me a widow.
The second and the third years...
...the singing somehow stopped.
I still wanted Tommy to marry me.
He'd lost an eye by then, but that didn't matter.
But he was nobler than ever.
Said it might be an arm next or a leg.
Those were the years of frustration.
Then tonight...
Tonight I realized what he feared the most.
Losing his sight.
Tom Rossiter is right.
I couldn't stand to live with half a man.
God, Kelly. It must be some hideous failing in me.
I'm so sick and tired to death of all the fighting and killing...
...and trying to be brave and patient over a lost cause.
So then we come to the fourth year.
The year of temptation.
Thank God you're not another one of those honourable men.
I've spent my life surrounded by honourable men.
Enjoying myself is one of my weaknesses.
I guess people like us have our own kind of honour.
It's not your advice I want, Kelly.
It's your money.
- House mortgaged?
- I've been asked to vacate.
Any other assets?
Myself.
To buy another dress?
I want you to help me get out of Richmond.
At the moment, impossible.
Nothing's impossible for you...
The minute our good colonel found out I was missing...
...he'd send a regiment after me.
I wouldn't make it to the city limits.
Tom and you?
- You're not what you're supposed to be.
- Who is?
Then why did you come here tonight?
Many reasons.
Mainly because you were his girl.
Only now, I find out you're not.
If I could manage something for you, would you be willing to go anywhere?
Anywhere.
There's a chance.
Just a chance.
Then you will try?
Yes, I'll try.
Kelly, I think we ought to drink to that.
I think we should.
I promised a friend that...
...this might take all night.
I wouldn't make a liar out of you for anything in the world.
Now, the main thing to remember is that...
...cattle are like women.
Sometimes you have to be firm.
Sometimes you have to be gentle.
And sometimes you have to give them a slap on the rump.
Your pistol, captain.
Now that's just a reminder that the sound of gunfire spooks cattle.
A sound that's practically guaranteed on our venture.
All right, now start singing, captain.
That's right. Sing.
Music's the best medicine for scared animals.
Now, look here.
The man said sing!
Yes, sir!
Loud and clear!
I wish I was in the land of cotton.
You, Hatcher, out there and sing.
For the want of one voice, the battle could be lost.
Sing.
- Damn it, sing!
- Colonel.
You know, I keep wondering why you came back to us...
...after slipping away from Hatcher.
I have a commitment.
Don't suppose you'd care to say where you went.
Not yet.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.
Developing a new weapon, Tom?
Trying to scare the Yanks to death?
His idea.
I hope those wailing banshees are ready.
They're ready.
We move tonight, on schedule.
I know your opinion, I want his.
What about it? Can the men manage the herd?
If he would keep after them so that the men sing on key...
You're beginning to annoy me, Mr. Kelly.
To the point of refusing my services?
Mr. Kelly, I'd give you the Richmond symphony...
...if they weren't already in the army.
Polish up your contralto, Tom...
...and I'll notify General Lee you're set to go.
Carry on. I'm going back to town.
Nothing like a bath, a bite to eat and a bottle of whiskey before battle.
- Reception.
- Yes, sir?
My name is Kelly.
Captain Ferguson is expecting me.
Tell him I'm in the dining room.
I shall tend to that, Mr. Kelly.
I'd like a double whiskey.
- Make that two. One for the captain.
- Mr. Kelly.
- Hope I didn't disturb you.
- Not at all.
I was just packing my gear.
- Getting ready to shove off.
- Aye, that I am. At nightfall.
Now, what can I do for you?
Book a passenger. A lady.
Anyone I might know?
Beside the point.
And yourself.
No.
Now, the Athena is a broad ship, but she's tiny.
I don't think...
Two thousand.
On the other hand, I am a man with no contempt for money at all.
And the advantage of being able to tell a beautiful lady...
...magnificent lies all the way to New York.
Nineteen Royall Street. She'll be waiting.
Alone, mind. No maidservants.
Alone.
With maidservant.
Bon voyage, captain.
And good luck to you, Mr. Kelly.
It's done.
And you halfway wish it weren't.
You're scared.
And if you weren't a proud person and in a public place, you'd be crying.
Like a baby.
It's quite a gamble.
You don't have to go through with it.
Oh, yes, I do.
Where I'm going, I don't know what will become of me.
But if I stay here, I know damn well what I'll become.
No girl, as pretty or passionate as you, has a right to such an honest mind.
What I wouldn't give to have you along.
If it's any comfort...
...I would have booked passage, only...
Only what?
In the courtyard is a bloodhound.
Rossiter's.
He can't see you, but don't turn.
When I leave here, he'll follow...
...and I'll let him chase me up a tree.
You stay for a while and then leave.
I've used you. Forgive me for that.
There's nothing to forgive.
As for using me, it seems to be the national pastime...
...of the Confederate States of America.
Goodbye, Liz.
What a ridiculous way to say goodbye.
Perhaps that's why we'll remember it longer.
Goodbye, Kelly. I'll be throwing you kisses from the rail tonight.
Yes, as I say,
I recognized the man with him...
...as one of Rossiter's Comanches...
...when the two of them entered the bordello.
I don't avail myself of its services, you understand, general.
But you'd be amazed how much information...
Get along with it.
Yes, sir.
This morning...
...ear to the ground, I learned from one of Harrison's servants...
...that Kelly had been spending his days at the Comanche camp.
And this afternoon, my vigilance paid off.
This afternoon, gentlemen, he made contact with one...
...Captain Ferguson, a well-known blockade runner.
Well, need I spell it out?
If it's not asking too much.
No, sir, not at all.
He is not looking for cheap land, as he pretends.
No, gentlemen. Alvarez Kelly...
...is planning to import herds of Mexican beef...
...into the Southern states by sea.
How long have you been in this business?
Four years.
Too long.
I beg your pardon?
Your theory is idiotic. Dismissed.
- What's that?
- I said, you're dismissed.
Out!
As you wish, sir.
Amusing picture.
Boatload of seasick cows, all standing with their heads over the rail.
Not priceless, Steadman?
Yes, sir.
But you're troubled.
Sir, I think there's something in what Mclntyre was saying.
Shipping cows from Mexico?
No, sir. Cattle closer to home.
Are we being exposed to the legal mind at work, major?
It's Kelly spending all that time with Rossiter.
Are you suggesting Kelly and Rossiter...
...are concocting a scheme to steal your herd?
Yes, sir.
Grant has an army around Richmond.
Rossiter has to get his cavalry out...
...and the cattle in.
Now, plead your case.
Anything else?
Request the general assign me additional troops.
If anybody tries to steal one of your precious cows...
...just telegraph me.
I promise to come a-running.
Get the officers in here.
Colonel Kelly will stay with me.
Colonel, huh?
I just made you lieutenant colonel...
...for the period of the raid.
Aren't you taking a risk, giving me that kind of authority?
When we get those cattle,
I'll be needing you to crack the whip.
You want to share the fun?
I doubt if you'd appreciate it.
- I like to laugh.
- I know you do.
Of course, this harebrained scheme is enough to make any man giddy.
Well, it's not my scheme making you giddy.
It's yours.
- How many guesses do I get?
- You don't need any.
That's bright of you, though, not to try to shake Hatcher off...
...a second time.
I wouldn't do a foolish thing like that.
I bet you wouldn't.
My goodness.
Parting with all that money.
For nothing.
It's a pity.
Considering what money means to you.
I think it went for a good purpose.
I'm sure of that.
I can see Ferguson donating it to a fund...
...for needy Scotchmen.
- You don't know how funny.
- It's too late.
- It is?
- Sure, his ship has sailed.
- I imagine it has.
- Didn't take you with him.
No, but he took Liz.
What?
I said, he took your girl.
Now how many guesses do I get?
You went to Royall Street, didn't you?
That money to Ferguson...
...for her passage.
Not yours.
Damn you, Kelly! Why?
Let's just say I was getting even with someone...
...for shooting a finger off.
I don't know how Liz could have anything to do with you!
Listen, you silly ass!
She's a female not a crinoline saint!
If you'd been as intent on pleasing her as serving the cause, she'd be with you.
Did you please her, Kelly?
I've got some advice for you, Rossiter.
Just close the book on this one.
I think I'll just do that.
- I'll close it...
- Colonel...
Reporting as ordered.
All right, gather around.
The tricky business is to get past Grant's line.
So we'll swing way out around it.
Fewer sentries.
We'll head for his back door, through Blackwater Swamp.
About a 50-mile route.
- If we can...
- Colonel? Pardon me, sir.
You're saying we'll plow through
Blackwater?
- That's one big swamp.
- That's my gamble.
Nobody will expect us, because nobody'd believe we could cross.
If we can get to the plantation by tomorrow night...
...we'll hide till dawn...
...take care of whatever Yanks are there.
- And then...
- I crack the whip.
That's what I'm here for.
Cavalry under General Hampton will cover our flank on the return.
General Lee's ordered a diversionary attack to hold the enemy's attention.
His artillery will be our sig...
That's it. That's Lee's artillery.
Our signal to ride. Let's go.
Bugler, call the men!
Colonel Kelly.
That book's not closed...
...yet.
If anything happens to me...
...kill him.
- Yes, sir.
Beaurider, ride across. Try it.
Old friends are the fairest.
General Rossiter detailed me as your aide.
Aide?
Light.
Next time, remember...
...never put the flame to the cigar.
A half an inch under.
You can learn about things like that in your spare time...
...while you're polishing my boots.
Looks fine, sir.
- All right. Take them across.
- Yes, sir.
Troops, full ahead.
Our luck's holding out.
That bridge is sound as a bell.
- I don't think so.
- They're crossing it.
Well-trained cavalrymen.
Slow their horses down and spread out.
What are you trying to say?
You ought to know cattle don't spread out. They jam together.
And when they do, they'll outweigh your horses 10-to-1.
This will come apart before the first steer hits the other side.
Williams, how long will it take you to shore up this bridge?
The rest of today and most of tomorrow.
You got till midnight.
Yes, sir.
Obliged, Mr. Kelly...
...for being so considerate of our problem.
My problem too.
I want to get Kelly across.
Yeah.
Move it!
Timber!
- Can you finish by midnight?
- No, sir. We can't. But we will.
Bring the column when you're done.
Farrow will meet you with word about the Yanks.
If I run into trouble, you take command.
And the herd. Let's go!
Is this the best way you could pick?
Yep. The best.
Because it's the most improbable.
Can you drive the cattle through here?
Solid spine, about 50 yards wide...
...and the Yanks know nothing about it?
If we keep the herd tight.
That's your job.
Farrow.
Beaurider.
Hatcher.
Just make sure you get there before dawn.
Come on.
Don't you ever get tired of being a chaperone?
I like it.
You know why?
Tell me.
I figure you might try once more.
You do that, Kelly.
Anytime you want to.
Just feel free.
I haven't been in this place for years.
Charity and I were kids, we used to sleep down here. Steal fruit.
When I get there, pick up a cone and throw it. And watch him.
Go on.
Hatcher, wait for me.
I'll take that.
Not even you...
...would shoot this close in.
Hurry up.
- How many men?
- Two hundred at least.
Any idea what regiment they are?
Pennsylvania 12th, and proud.
We fought them in the wilderness.
They're equipped with new repeating rifles.
- Where are they bunked down?
- Down by the old corral.
The old corral.
Farrow.
Charity. Apple core.
Baltimore.
Who's your friend?
Tom.
- Where's Steadman?
- Overseer's cottage.
- Telegraph line?
- At the cottage.
Cut it. As far from the cottage as you can.
Obliged, Charity. You've done your homework real well.
Come on.
- Hatcher?
- Here.
I hate to see loose guns lying around.
I'm glad you got it.
It'll make me feel better when I blow your guts out.
You'd better be faster than these two clowns you got here.
You could make me a Yankee hero.
He was near the fence, major.
We ordered him to halt. He ran.
- Should we notify Kautz?
- And tell him what?
- Reb spy.
- One man.
Unless we can produce the whole of
Hapham's cavalry, he'll just laugh.
- Corporal, get the servants.
- Yes, sir.
Beaurider.
Prisoner?
He's dead.
Question is, did he cut that wire?
Ruth.
You recognize him?
No, sir.
You sure?
I ain't never seen him before in my life.
Men?
- Never laid eyes on him, master.
- No, sir.
Anybody else?
I don't understand.
We're down here fighting for you.
Fighting to free you.
Ruth, how can you be so loyal...
...to someone who wants to keep you a slave?
Maybe that's the worst of them.
All right, bury him.
Wait.
Apples? This time of year?
Storage apples.
From a fruit cellar.
Game's up!
Everybody out!
All right, come on out with your hands up!
Come on out!
Come out or we'll fire!
Hands up! Up!
You put that gun down, please.
Well, Mr. Kelly.
Sergeant...
Lieutenant, sir.
No!
After him! Webster, telegraph line, make sure it's cut!
Farrow, the Yanks.
Now, you just hold it here, Kelly.
This is where I put you to work.
Let's get these Yanks out of here.
Come on, get going!
Rise and shine, gents! Get up! Come on!
Up and at them, blue boy.
Easy.
All right, out.
All right, out!
Get them in the corral!
Come on, boys. Let's move that powder.
Be careful there, Zeb.
All right. Start moving that herd.
- You see where Steadman's headed?
- I said, move.
Listen, you idiot.
Cattle can't make 5 miles an hour.
You'll be in Yankees up to here.
- You'll be lucky to get your men out.
- I told you to move!
No herd, no Kelly.
It was like playing games the other night, wasn't it?
Exciting and honorable.
How does it strike you now?
I'll ride point. Williams, you take the left flank.
Captain Webster, you take the right.
Would you consider riding drag?
No.
I didn't think so.
All right, move them out!
There it is, colonel. Just the way you saw it in that crazy dream.
With the genera"s permission...
...I'd like to remind the general
I warned him about this.
My judgement was correct all along.
Absolutely correct.
I gambled Lee would risk his cavalry and he did. He did.
The herd is big for Rossiter, and he's big for Hampton.
- Hampton?
- He was sighted, just as I planned.
I knew what that beef meant to the Rebs.
Colonel Jacobs is ready to ride.
- What's his strength?
- About 6000.
Excellent. Jacobs is to proceed down the Jerusalem Plank Road...
...and if he's fast he'll have
Hampton by the throat.
Which might never have happened...
...if I'd listened to your request for more troops.
What are you waiting for?
Detect my strategy, major?
Yes, sir.
Now, major. Question:
How do you believe Rossiter expects to get that herd back to Richmond?
Well, I'd say he's gonna drive the cattle into Blackwater Swamp.
I guess that's how they came...
...using the bridge at Cook's Crossing.
Splendid. That's why I'm giving you my reserves: 300 cavalry...
...plus a howitzer battery.
Satisfied?
Well?
Yes, sir. That's splendid, sir.
Yes, sir.
Herd them in tighter.
Colonel!
What is it?
I couldn't catch him.
Not with no quarter-mile lead.
Farrow! Take two men, scout ahead.
Yes, sir. Lanier, Dugot, let's go.
Yankees!
Let's get to the colonel. Let's go!
Come on, you stupid hunk of leather!
Get out of here!
You're miles from the stew pot!
Come on, move them out of here!
After a march, they've a right to a rest and a drink.
We don't have the time!
Get over!
Yankee cavalry.
They're hustling.
Probably at the bridge now.
- How many?
- Looked like a full squadron...
...and a battery of howitzers.
Can we bypass that bridge?
Nothing but swamp.
We'd drown every one of them.
- Williams?
- Yes, sir.
Drown them.
Drive them in the swamp.
At least that'll deny them the Yankee bellies.
Yes, sir.
- And, Williams?
- Yes, sir.
It does seem a pity to disappoint those Yanks at the bridge.
What you got in mind, colonel?
We'll split in two ranks, move at them from both sides.
Holy Mother of God.
3000 miles to drown in a stinking swamp!
You make me sick.
The Virginia Comanches do or die.
You're long on gallantry but short on sense.
We'll talk later.
You know nothing about cattle.
- What are you driving at?
- You want them in Richmond?
You know something, or are you just blowing hard, as usual?
You want this herd in Richmond?
You trying to tell me you know a way?
I might.
What's it worth to you?
What's your price?
You know what the price is.
All right, you got it.
Hatcher...
...any instructions I gave regarding Colonel Kelly:
Cancelled.
Yes, sir.
I'm in command now.
Go ahead.
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
How many Yanks did you say?
I'd say abut 300, sir.
And about 100 of us.
2500 head of cattle.
That makes 2600 for our side.
We'll divide them up into groups of 500 each.
I want an inventory of ammunition.
Assemble your men for instructions.
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
This business of command comes easy to me.
Hatcher.
You know, sergeant...
...I'm going to miss your merry smile and winning ways. Get to work.
Let's hurry that up.
Do you still think they'll come this way?
- Get your men quiet.
- Quiet on the line!
The funny thing about cattle. You can hear them like the pounding of surf.
Come on!
Move it along! Get them going!
Move it along! Keep them moving!
Alert your men.
Ready on the firing line!
Get them moving!
All right, split them up!
Here they come.
Keep them moving!
- Shall I fire now?
- No, hold your fire.
All right, fire! Fire!
Shoot! Get the cattle! Get the cattle!
All right, hold, men. Hold!
Move them over to the right!
Hold your fire!
Here's the second group. Move!
Circle them twice!
Take it across the bridge. Fast!
- Williams!
- Yes, sir.
- Keep them on the run.
- Yes, sir!
Hatcher!
Ropes.
Drop it.
Swing it over.
Pull the rope.
Set the next one. Come on, hurry it up!
Hatcher, lay a trail.
Yes, sir!
Get them across the bridge!
As soon as the last man's over, light it.
Yes, sir!
Move them out! Move them over!
Over to the bridge!
Everybody out! Move!
Across the bridge!
Come here.
Get me a report of all companies.
Regroup here. Follow me!
Hatcher!
Hey, Mex! Now's your time!
General Hampton's compliments.
He's got the Union troops contained.
- It's clear sailing to Richmond.
- That's fine. Just fine.
We lost about 40 steers.
That's not bad.
You got one eye.
Looks like now you got one lung.
You keep on fighting like this, you'll wind up with one of everything.
You seem to manage pretty well yourself.
For a nine-fingered man.
Got 20 wounded.
Eight dead, sir.
Including Farrow and Hatcher.
Must've dropped Hatcher when he lit that fuse.
He timed it well.
If he'd lit that fuse any earlier, l...
He timed it fine.
He got chopped down like a hero.
Yeah.
We're all heroes.
Start pushing that herd.
All right, sir.
Well...
...I suppose you'd like to be moving on.
The sooner I get to Richmond, the quicker I get home.
Better feel your ground.
You're a wanted man...
...by the Yanks.
Kelly?
I saw some crazy things at that bridge.
One of them was you, risking your life to save a Confederate officer.
Seems to me that was...
...kind of long on gallantry, short on sense.
- Wouldn't you say?
- I try everything on once.
See if it fits.
Looked kind of stylish on you.
I never thought I'd catch myself saying that.
Don't worry, I won't try it twice.
For once, the soldiers of the Confederacy...
...and the people of Richmond would eat their fill.
What General Grant said when he heard...
...that his prize herd was raided is unquotable.
President Lincoln's comment is a matter of record.
Lincoln called it.
"The slickest piece of cattle stealing
I ever heard of. "
Otto.
Mr. Habershaw.
-Stop him!
-Mr. Habershaw.
Stop him.
Mr. Habershaw.
You're leaving me now.
Mr. Habershaw?
Henry Drummond.
Henry Drummond. you're not leaving.
Henry!
They're here.
Come on. get back.
Come on. make room. Come on.
Mr. Buford. Howdy. Mr. Buford.
Hello. we're here. and we got our 200 head just outside of town.
-We made it all right.
-No. you didn't.
-What are you talking about?
-We made a deal.
You said you were gonna have them cattle in here 1 2:00 noon.
But it's only 1 2:30.
A deal is a deal.
-Mr. Buford. Please. Mr. Buford. please.
-Mr. Buford. Mr. Buford.
-Mr. Buford.
-Please. Mr. Buford.
-Please. Mr. Buford.
-Please. Mr. Buford.
-Mr. Buford.
-Please. Mr. Buford.
Get back. Stand back there.
Come on. get back. Stand back.

Whoa. pull up there.
Whoa. pull up there.

-They're still playing.

Toby. did you find out anything?
-He ain't talking.
-You know Sam.
-Sam. listen.
-Sam.
Somebody's losing a lot. huh. Sam?
What's happening. Sam?
What's happening?
-They're playing.
-But who's ahead? ls you gonna tell us old Buford's cashing in? l don't believe it. l didn't say nothing about Buford or Tropp or Wilcox or nobody.
Well. say something.
How much money you figure is on the table right now?
None of my business.
Oh. come on. Sam. lt ain't no secret who's winning. is it? l don't know. l ain't in the secret business. l'm in the hotel business.
Now. l hear you say something about buying a drink?
No. not me.
-Sam.
-Yeah?
Oh. hi. Doc.
Who's winning?
Drummond's winning.
The stage is leaving in 1 0 minutes.
Hey. Sparrow.
Hey. Toby.
Stagecoach leaving in 1 0 minutes. folks. for Mirando. Hebbronville...
...San lgnaba. Bustamante. and points south.
Yes. sir. you got 1 0 minutes. one and all.
Mirando. Hebbronville. San lgnaba.
Bustamante. and all points south.
Hi. Doc.
Get out of Doc's chair.

Nobody who ain't in the game gets in that room. huh. Mr. Habershaw?
Meredith--
Jackie? Jackie. come here.
Oh. Jackie. what have you got--?
Meredith. we've got to get that wagon to the blacksmith.
We've got to leave town tomorrow.
There's a lot of work to be done on that wheel.
All l asked the gentleman was to be allowed to-- Mary. please.
-Mary. lookit. all l want to do is watch.
-Meredith. you promised.
Good Lord. you don't want to deprive me of that too.
-l can't get into trouble watching.
-l never said you were going to--
Please listen. You and Jackie drive the wagon down to the smith's.
Let me watch the game till you get back from the blacksmith's.
-Meredith. you know very well you won't--
-This is fate. Mary. Don't you see that?
Chance to get into a game of cards in the middle of nowhere.
The good Lord give me this one last chance just to watch a game of cards.
There won't be any cards on the farm. you know that. l've given my word.
Give me this one last little concession. l won't be breaking my word if l just watch.
You just heard the gentleman say they don't allow any spectators. ls that a hard and fast rule. sir? lf l say you can watch. you can watch.
-But if the lady objects. l wouldn't think--
-There. lt's up to you. Mary....
Meredith. the blacksmith may be a long time. l don't--
Give me just 1 5 minutes. then l'll join you at the blacksmith's. l cross my heart. Mary....
Oh. Meredith.
Jackie. you stay right here.
You stay with him every second while l'm gone.
-Don't you let him out of your sight.
-Oh. no. Mary.
Giddyup. ls it all right if...?
Can't we come in too? l'm in.
Hey. who's this?
Friends of mine.
Friends of yours?

-l said they could watch.
-Otto. you know the rules.
-Yeah.
-Ain't nobody-- l said they could watch.
Cut.
Five card draw. ante 25.
You on the poker wagon. mister?
-Mister?
-What?
Oh. yes. you might put it that way. yes.
Little woman make you give it up?
Well. we talked it over. but it was my decision.
You open. Otto.
Twenty-five dollars.
Like to see my wife ask me to quit.
Oh. l didn't say my wife--
Can't you just see Genevieve...
...asking me to restrain myself from a nice. friendly little game of cards?
Twenty-five. and 50 more.
How long since you've seen that wife of yours. Denny?
Oh. l don't know.
Two. maybe three months.
You don't pay too much attention to little old Genevieve. do you?
-You're darn tooting.
-Why should he?
Any man gets himself married is automatically stupid.
Denny's just refusing to stay stupid.
He just don't ever see his wife.
Words of wisdom from the confirmed bachelor.
Confirmed and reconfirmed. l hate women. l believe you.
You've buried enough of them.
Sure l did. l put them back where they belong.
-Cards. Otto.
-Come on.
What's your hurry. Tropp?
You nervous l might bury you?
Get it. boys? l'll bury him. and he's....
We get it.
-Two cards.
-Three.
Three.
Where you folks bound for?
San Antonio. San Antone.
One.
Texas.
One. and dealer takes three.
San Antone. huh?
San Antone. Texas.
Oh. that's a long way.
Fifty dollars. ln.
We bought a place there.
Plan to do a little farming.
And 50. Ain't no such thing as a little farming.
Yeah.
Well. what l mean. we don't have a big place...
...a big spread. just a nice piece of land just outside San Antone.
-How much land?
-Forty acres.
Forty acres?
What you planning to do. raise stinkweed?
Y'all listen. listen.
One whole year l've been honing my backside...
...to sit in on this game and what am l doing?
Playing poker? Hell no. l'm talking about the stinkweed crop in San Antone. Texas.
Let's play cards. l bet a hundred dollars.
You know what l give up to play in this game?
-A million dollars.
-No. more than that.
More than that to me.
Mr. Big-Mouth Lawyer.
My daughter Ceely was getting married.
-Ceely?
-That's right.
When Tropp come for me. she was getting married.
And they're holding up the love. honor and obey part till l get back.
You walked out in the middle of the wedding? l did. l ain't been late for this game in 1 6 years...
...and l ain't about to start now. wedding or no wedding. l told them. l said. ''You start late. and l may not be around for the finish.''
The groom got held up by the flood in Baker Flats...
...so the wedding was late getting started.
''When Tropp and Habershaw get here.'' l said...
...''l'm walking out of this house whether Ceely's hitched by then or not.''
Now. that's how much this game means to me.
Do you mind if we indulge in what l left my little girl waiting at the altar for?
Do you mind if we play a little cards? l just raised a hundred dollars. l don't think that's a very nice thing to do to your daughter.
Well. look who's mealy-mouthing me about being nice.
Old Mr. Tight-Fist-30-Percent-on-My-Money-
Or-l-Foreclose...
...Mr. Jesse Buford himself in the flesh.
Now. don't you give me no Sunday-school lesson about being nice.
Sit up and pay attention to this game.
Now. are you gonna call or ain't you gonna call?
Now. l got 300 United States dollars in that pot says that l got a hand.
That's a lot of money. l fold. l got lots more. l come loaded for bear. not chickens.
Let's play for money.
You're the one that said it.
And 5.
Beat three deuces.
Full house beats it. l guess.
You're an expert on the rules.
Mr. Wilcox.
According to Mr. Hoyle. the rules say that a full house beats three of a kind.
-That's what they say.
-That's what l thought.
Horse shoes.
Oh. no. Henry. l am not lucky. l'm just skillful.
Yeah.
-Pardon me.
-Yeah. what do you want?
-You bet a hundred dollars on three twos?
-l bet the way l feel like it.
-ls this a private game?
-What does that mean?
Well. l mean. can anybody pull up a chair?
-Papa.
-Quiet.
-Pull up a chair. huh?
-Well. now....
-We got a rule about that.
-What's that?
You can pull up a chair. all right. if you got the price of admission.
-How much is that?
-One thousand dollars.
Cash. On the line.
Come on. deal. Otto.
Twenty-five dollars. five-card stud. Cut.

You paid for it.
-lt's table stakes.
-l assumed as much.
-And Western rules on betting.
-Meaning?
Meaning you can't tap out if you ain't got enough to bet.
Just bow out. leave your money on the table.
-That's a rough game.
-lt's the game we play.
Good enough for me.
Then it's your deal. mister.
Been a long time.
Sure feels good.
Hi. son.

Papa. when are you gonna stop?
Don't you ever get tired just hanging around?
-Why don't you go upstairs?
-Hey. sonny?
Why don't you come over here next to me?
You ain't gonna learn nothing watching Papa. l can see now why your old lady made you quit this game.
Now deal.
-lsn't it time we had a new deck?
-Dealer can call for a new deck any time.
-Papa.
-Will you please be quiet? lt's a question of averages.
-The cards are due to break for me.
-Famous last words.
Pretty good mitt he's got there. huh?
Handles them cards real good.
Yeah. just like my old grandma used to.
Oh. he's a real expert mechanic.
Hey. ain't it great to see an artist handle them pasteboards?
Must have had a lot of practice.
Oh. takes a lot of practice to keep on losing the way he is.
Twenty-five dollars ante. five-card draw.
-Otto?
-l'm in.
Oh. God.
So you were good to yourself?
He's got himself a hot one this time. l bet he's got himself two dandy little deuces. eh?

And you. sir?
Oh. l guess l'll just sit tight.
Well. now. what do you know?
He's got himself a big one.
Why. sure he has. He said he would.
Watch out. boys.
He just might have himself five deuces.
Two hundred dollars.
What's the matter. mister? lt ain't hot in here.
Why. sure it is.
That is. if you got four aces.
He can't have four aces. l got them.
No. you can't have four. l got three myself.
Well. l'll call that 200.
And l raise 200.
That's $400 to you.
And you know something. mister?
You ain't got enough left to stay in this pot.
And you know the rules.
We said Western style.
You just keep them there till l get back.
Don't let anybody see those cards.
-Hey. mister. Wait a minute. mister.
-Now. wait.
-Hey.
-Now. wait a minute.
There's nothing in the rules about leaving in the middle of a hand.
So long as he leaves the cards here. Denny.
So long as he leaves the cards here.
Well. boy. it's a good thing your mommy ain't here. huh?
She'd give him a what for.
What's Mama do when Papa loses all the bacon?

Who's bigger. sonny. Mama or Papa?
And who wears the pants?

He's still in that backroom. ma'am.
They're playing cards.

Mister? l don't think you're paying strict attention.
What l said was. if you wanna stay in this game...
...you better go upstairs and get 420 more dollars out of the sock.
-lt isn't fair.
-What isn't fair?
This rule about not being able to tap out of the game.
That's the rule. mister.
That is the rule.
Now. we told you all about it.
Well. you going upstairs?
-There's no more money upstairs.
-Now. ain't that a shame.
-Up to you. Tropp.
-Now. wait a minute.
You can't wash me out of the game.
You just can't do it.
Now. look. mister.
First rule of the game of poker...
...whether you're playing
Eastern or Western rules...
...or the kind they play at the North Pole. is put up or shut up.
You can give me credit.
-Meredith.
-Mama.
-Stay out of this.
-Look here.
-We don't allow no woman in here.
-Listen. l've got-- l've got this.
All right. l'll give you a hundred dollars on the watch. now you need 320 more. ln the name of heaven. what are you doing? l say we ain't never allowed no woman in here.
-Shut up.
-But she's a woman.
-Shut up.
-That's a solid gold watch.
-lt's worth more than a hundred.
-No.
Just give me a minute.
Mary. Mary. listen. lt's not what you think it is.
We got a chance here to earn more money than you ever dreamed of. ls all of our money on that table?
Have you taken every cent of it?
But l know what l'm doing.
With this hand. l can't lose.
Trust me. Mary. you gotta trust me just this once.
-The whole 4000?
-But l haven't lost it. Mary. lt isn't as if l'd lost it. l'm investing it. l'm still in the game.
Mary. dear. listen to me. l got a hand of cards here comes to a man once in a lifetime.
You hear me? Once in a lifetime.
Trust me. you just gotta trust me.
Trust you?
Trust you? God in heaven. how many times have l trusted you?
How many times and how many days and how many years...
...have l trusted and trusted and sat and waited and wept...
...while you played with cards that couldn't lose?
But you lost. and you lost until you got sick with losing...
...and you swore by all that was holy that you would never play cards again.
And l trusted you. Meredith. but look at us.
You've thrown away every cent we've saved in this world.
All we've got is the team and the wagon. l'm gonna win this time. l'm gonna win. lf l can ju-- l got a $ 700 team and wagon l'll sell for $500.
-Meredith!
-Did you hear me?
Meredith. whatever you do. please don't-- l got the team and wagon. l got 1 1 wagons. Maybe two. 300 horses.
You need a team and wagon. Ben?
Jesse? Denny?
-Otto?
-Did you hear what l said? l'll take a $200 loss on a brand-new team and wagon.
That's a bargain. all right...
...but it ain't a bargain unless it's something you need.
But it's a brand-new team and wagon.
We bought it--
Meredith!
Meredith.
Sam. Sam. Toby. Pete. somebody. lt might not be such a good idea. ma'am. to move him.

-Come out.
Doc. we were sent for you.
We need you. Doc. lt's an emergency.
Doc. we was sent for you. lt's an emergency. Doc.
Come on down.
Now. you open this door.
-Come on down. Doc.
-The door's open.
Doc. get your bag.
Doc. it's an emergency. a real emergency. There's a fella--
A man's dying. Doc.
You gotta come with us.
-Wait up now. wait up. Who's dying?
-Well. this new fella came into town.
And he got into the game.
He's playing in the game. ln the middle of the game. he's on the floor.
And then they call us in. tell us to come get you.
All right. Now. calm down. now.
Calm down. let's start all over again.
Well. Doc. there's this fella. see?
And he come into town with his wife and kid.
Here. Mama.
Oh. please.
-How many. ma'am?
-One. only one.
-Did someone bring the water?
-Water be damned.
Pardon me. ma'am.
Drink it. mister.
-Go on now. drink it.
-He's not accustomed to liquor.
-Be better for him if he was.
-Mary.
You....
Oh. darling. what is it?
What do you want me to do?
-You....
-The doc's here.
Come on. he's here. Let him in. ln here. Doc.
All right. ma'am. Ma'am. l need room.
Will you please...?
What's this?
The heart?
How many times has this happened before?
Madam. l haven't got time for bedside manners.
Now answer my questions and answer them quick.
How many times has this happened to your husband?
Once. Only once.
He ain't breathing so good. is he. ma'am?
Lend a hand.
Sam. where's the nearest bed?
And l don't mean upstairs.
We got no beds downstairs. lnto the kitchen. Clear the room.
-Yeah.
-Gently. gently. you clumsy....
All right now. boys. back to the bar.
Plenty of good liquor back in the bar.
Come on now. that's it.
-Come on.
-Meredith.
-Just a minute. please.
-Meredith. l'd rather you didn't come in here right now. l'm his wife.
His wife is the last person l want in here right now.
Be sensible and do what l say. l'll let you in as soon as l can.
Now. you two stay here. l may want your help.
What are you gonna do?
Whatever l can. madam. l promise you. whatever l can.
-Doc.
-What is it?
-l just wanna ask a simple question.
-Well. what is it? ls he gonna be able to finish this hand?
Henry Drummond. for the love of....
Well. l was just asking.
How can you be so vile?
Now. look. lady. you got problems. all right. l'm sorry you got problems. but l got problems too.
-l come a long way to play in this game.
-l'm with you. Henry.
For God's sake.
Look. a man's sick.
All right. a man's sick.
Anything l can do about that? No.
But l got a little girl sitting. waiting for her daddy to come home...
...so she can get married.
And there's something l can do about that. l aim to finish. l am getting a little sick and tired of hearing how much you give up to get here.
My daughter's wedding. that's how much l give up. l give up a man's life.
You gave up what? l was defending Owney Price on a charge of horse stealing when Tropp come for me. l was fixing to make my plea to the jury...
...when Ben busted in that courtroom hollering for me. l give you all my word l'd be ready the minute he showed.
Did l let my duty as counsel for the defense stand in my way? l did not. l left that courtroom the minute Tropp showed. l left Owney's head halfway in the noose when l walked out of that courtroom.
That's what l did to play in this game of poker.
But l ain't entirely forsook my membership in the human race. l ain't worrying about a game of poker...
...while that little lady's husband lays dying.
Well. that's the difference between you and me. let's put it that way.
The man's gonna die.
There ain't nothing we can do about it.
So l aim to finish this pot here and now.
And if he can't be around to finish....
What happens?
Tell her. Denny.
-We have to go by the rules. ma'am.
-What rules?
He loses the money. by default.
Oh. but that's every penny we have in this world.
Ma'am. your husband didn't take that into consideration.
Why should l?
You better come in. ma'am.
-How is he?
-Better come in.
Meredith.
-Mary.
-Oh. darling.
Mary. you--
-Mary. you--
-Darling. quiet.
-Mary. you....
-Please.
You....
What's he trying to tell me? lt's my guess. ma'am...
...he's asking you to play the hand for him.
He wants me to play the hand?
All right. ma'am. you better get out of here now.
How do you play this game?
What'd you say. lady? l asked you. how do you play this game?
You mean to tell us. ma'am. that you don't know the rules? l've never played a game of cards in my life.
-Sam.
-Yeah? How is he?
Doc wants the shutter used to carry drunks.
Right.
-ls he all right?
-No change. ma'am.
Oh. what are you doing?
We're a long way from a hospital. ma'am.
Next best thing in these parts is my house where my equipment is.
-Now easy. boys.
-Darling. Darling.
Now. let's have no more talking. ma'am.
-Move along. move along.
-Wait a minute. wait a minute. l wish we could stay. but l've got to get him to my house.
-Papa.
-Move along.
Papa.
Never mind the boy. Hurry up.
Jackie. Jackie.
-You go with your father.
-No.
Well. all right then. you sit over in that chair.
Gentlemen. l have no choice but to continue to play this game in my husband's place.
You're gonna what?
That money represents 1 0 years of scrimping and saving. lt represents our new home in San Antonio...
...and it represents all our dreams of a decent future for our son. l have no choice but to protect it.
And you have no choice. gentlemen.
And what do we have to do?
You have to teach me how to play this game. l told you when she come in here.
But. ma'am. it takes years--
Let's not even talk about it. lt's crazy to even talk about it.
-Pour me one. will you. Otto?
-Women. l say let's get her out of here.
-Hold it. Ben.
-Hold what?
Hold it. l can explain enough to the lady to clean up the situation to everybody's satisfaction.
How in a big fat pig's eye are you gonna clean it up to my satisfaction?
Listen carefully.
Yes?
This is the way it is.
We're all of us holding cards. see?
And we. all of us. each of us. we think we got better cards...
...than anybody else in the game.
-You follow me. ma'am?
-Yes.
Now. we're each of us so sure that we got the best hand...
...that we're willing to bet on it.
That is the principle of the game. ma'am.
You make a bet you got the best hand. l understand.
You bet money.
Mr. Drummond is correct. l've got $3500 on that table that says that l've got the best hand.
Mr. Drummond here. he's got $3500 in there saying the same thing for him.
And the same goes for Mr. Tropp.
Mr. Buford and Mr. Wilcox.
Everybody at this table is betting $3500...
...that he's got the winning hand.
Well. go on.
Everybody but your husband. that is.
That's the nub of it.
All your husband could throw in there was $3000.
Now. he's gotta get up another $500 to stay in...
...or he's gotta bow out of the game. ls that clear. ma'am?
Oh. extremely clear. Mr...?
Habershaw. ma'am.
Mr. Otto Habershaw.
You left out something.
Mr. Habershaw.
Tell her what happens even if he does raise the 500.
Tell her it ain't gonna be enough.
Because this pot's gonna get higher and higher. l guarantee it.
He's right. ma'am.
And my name is Drummond. ma'am.
Mr. Henry P.G. Drummond.
Well. my husband offered to sell his gold watch and chain. l heard him.
Maybe you heard me say. out of the goodness of my heart...
...that l'd give him a hundred dollars on it.
He was also offering our team and our wagon.
Oh. any you boys wanna buy a team and wagon?
Gentlemen all.
All such gallant gentlemen.
Yeah. we're gallant on Sunday.
This is Friday. and we're playing poker.
Now. you wanna play with us. you ante up $500.
Now. listen. Henry. there's no need to insult the lady.
Oh. now. look. since damn when did you climb up on that big white horse?
Just because you're teasing yourself with some hot ideas...
...for you and the lady after the game--
-Henry--
-Now. don't tell me. l know you. so don't tell me how to behave.
Once a year. l come here to play poker. l don't come here for a lot of sweet talk and la-di-da. l didn't come to listen to you shoot your big fat mouth.
Now. hold it.
Now. just a doggone minute.
None of us come here to listen to a dogfight either.
Now. let's stick to the point.
You tell them. Denny.
And the point's very simple.
Now. you got $500 to play a man's game...
...or ain't you got $500? lf you ain't. time's a-wasting. We wanna get home before the rainy season.
Yeah.
Will you accept an lOU?
Ma'am. if you want credit from a businessman...
...you have to come up with some real security. ls there a bank in this town?
-What was that again. ma'am?
-l asked you. is there a bank in this town?
The Cattle and Merchants Bank. right across the street.
-Come on. Jackie.
-Ma'am.
You bowing out of this game? l'm going to the bank.
-For what?
-For money.
From the bank?
Directly across the street. did you say?
Lady. maybe you don't understand. lf we don't extend you no money. credit. how do you expect to get it from a bank?
On your team and wagon? lt ain't that kind of a bank. lady. lt just ain't that kind of a bank.
Come along. Jackie.
Just a minute. ma'am.
Ma'am. Ma'am...
...l don't like to be. like they say. the lawyer for the devil...
...but you just can't walk out of this room with them cards in your hand.
-Why not?
-Why not? lt just ain't poker. that's why. lt don't go by the rules.
You see. ma'am. while you're out of the room...
...anything could happen. you could....
-l could cheat?
-Well. no. ma'am. What l--
Now. ma'am. l didn't say....
What l mean is. since you don't know the rules of the game--
Now. let me tell you something. all of you.
You may play poker for fun...
...or whatever selfish thrill you get out of this horrid game...
...but l am playing for my life.
My life. gentlemen.
And l have no intention of letting these cards...
...out of my possession.
My husband gave them to me. and l am playing for him...
...and l will not relinquish these cards for any reason whatsoever.
-Yes. ma'am. but--
-And you will not force me to.
Now. it is time for the five of you to show one spark of human decency...
...and allow one compromise in your silly rules.
Silly rules? l think we can accommodate the lady and still keep everybody happy.
Oh. he's got another suggestion.
-l have.
-What?
One of us goes to the bank with her.
You. huh? l'd be honored. l raise one little point of order. ma'am.
Yes?
Are you willing to turn your back on them?
What do you mean?
Well. once you leave this room. you don't know what they'll do with their cards. l trust them.
Seven. eight. nine. 1 0.
A lot of money. Mrs. Craig.
My money.
Oh. Mr. Habershaw. Mr. Drummond.
Mr. Wilcox. how do you do?
And Mr. Tropp.
Game over. gentlemen?
-No.
-Not yet?
Well. then something l can do for you. gentlemen?
The little lady you can take care of.
We come with her.
Yes. Can l help you. ma'am?
Well. l'd like very much....
Oh. you're only the teller. l am the teller. ma'am. l'd like very much to speak to the manager. please.
Manager. ma'am?
We got no manager. but what we got is Mr. Ballinger.
Mr. Ballinger is the manager. and the assistant manager...
...and the president and the cashier and the landlord.
Mr. Ballinger owns the bank. ma'am.
Then it's Mr. Ballinger l'd like to see.
Well. this time of day.
Mr. Ballinger's always very busy. ma'am.
Can l help you? l'm the teller.
She wants to see Ballinger.
Well. l don't guarantee anything.
Come in.
Ballinger.
Will you come this way. please?
-You want to see me personally?
-Yes. Mr. Ballinger.
Well....
Well. well. well. the game must be over. lt's still going on.
We're just taking a little rest.
No rest for the wicked. Henry. you know that.
And this is not siesta time.
This is an office. designed for the transaction of business.
The little lady is here on business.
We come with her.
Well. all right.
Back to your cage. Fleeson.
Sit down. madam. sit down. ls this yours?
Oh. yes. this is my son. Jackie.
Shake hands with Mr. Ballinger. son.
How do you do. how do you do?
Now then. madam. why do you...
...under the protection of this brigade of citizens...
...insist on seeing me personally?
Well. Mr. Ballinger. you seem to be aware of the poker game going on at the hotel. l am.
For reasons...
...too unreasonable to go into here. l happen to be playing in that game.
-No.
-Yes.
-ls this true. Otto?
-lt's true.
-l don't believe it.
-Oh. it's true.
All right. l believe it. l don't approve of it. but l believe it.
Proceed.
There's a grand total of $20.500 sitting in the middle of that table right now.
-You mean in one pot?
-Yes.
-That must be a new record. Henry.
-lt is.
Twenty thousand. five hundred dollars.
-Good heavens.
-And it's my turn to bet...
...but. you see. l don't have.... l mean. my husband and l....
Oh. how can l explain it?
We've put $4000 into that game and l have to stay with it. l will not be forced out of that game.
You have grit. madam. l always admire tenacity and grit.
But just how does your desire to stick with the game concern me and my bank? l don't have the money to stick with it. l see. What collateral do you have to offer?
On what do you propose to borrow this money?
On this.
Well. it must be a good hand. lsn't it a good hand? lsn't it a very good hand of poker?
Don't you know?
No. l'm only taking my husband's word for it.
Your husband's word?
-Well. he took sick.
-Sick?
Well. he was playing the hand. and then he had a....
Now. please don't make me try to explain it. because l can't.
But. now. isn't that a good hand?
Put those cards away. young woman.
-What?
-Put them away.
-Otto. this is one of your jokes.
-No.
One of yours. Henry.
Young woman. woman l've never seen before...
...tells me she's involved in the biggest poker game that ever came down the pike.
That one was hard enough to swallow.
And then she tells me she wants to borrow money from my bank...
...to stay in the game.
That's when l should have called
Mr. Fleeson...
...to have you ejected from the premises.
What was your next unholy revelation?
You offer your poker hand as collateral for the money.
Pelion on Ossa. madam.
Pelion on Ossa.
A quotation from the Greek poets. lt means when you pile one mountain on top of another...
...one horrendous glob of flummery on top of another.
Now. young woman...
...you have the bile and the gall to tell me you don't know about poker.
All right. the joke is over.
As for me. l'm a busy man.
-You've got it all wrong. Ballinger.
-You got me all wrong. Otto Habershaw.
At compound interest.
They didn't take the trouble to tell you. when they put you up to this...
...that C.P. Ballinger is the kind of man...
...who can't tolerate liquor. cards or women. reading from left to right.
And l would appreciate it if you and your fun-loving friends...
...would remove yourselves from the premises.
Fleeson!
What happened? What happened?
What happened?
Ma'am?
Did you get the money. ma'am?
Huh. ma'am? lf you'd asked us. ma'am. we'd have told you. lf you wanna borrow money from C.P. Ballinger...
...you gotta at least come up with a second mortgage.
All right. Ben. let's play cards.
Come on. Ben. she's out of the game. lf l ain't being too nosy. ma'am...
...just what kind of collateral did you offer Ballinger?
She asked Ballinger to lend money on the hand she's holding.
She-- She what?
Yeah.
Hey. C.P.. how much interest would you charge me on an inside straight?
Hey. me too. C.P. How about 6 percent on a dandy little flush?
So it was a joke. wasn't it? l came over to see for myself. lt was no joke.
Then what's so funny? lt ain't funny. C.P.
Don't tell me. l told you before. l'll tell you again.
Ballinger. lt was no joke.
The lady meant it.
That's what these damn fools are laughing at. if you really wanna know. lt isn't me they're laughing at?
Hell no. C.P. lt'd be dangerous for any man in this room to be laughing at you.
Now. wouldn't it. C.P.?
That it would. Dennis. that it would.
With quarterly mortgage payment time coming up.
-You. Sam Rhine.
-Yes. sir?
What'd l make you do before l gave you the mortgage on your house?
-You made me fix the cellar.
-Correct.
Give me collateral with a solid foundation or don't ask me for money.
Forty-six years ago...
...l started lending money in Larry Bingham's backroom.
My first customer was a drover named Penney.
Wanted $2 on a brindled cow at 6 percent interest.
Said she gave 6 quarts of milk a day.
You know what l made him do? l made him move that cow into my backyard for a whole week.
And l watched him milk her every day.
Sure enough. she gave an average of 6 and a half quarts a day.
So l gave him the money. at 6 and a half percent interest.
Not only that. l kept the 60 pounds of manure she left behind.
Show me collateral. madam.
You better make sure it's good collateral.
Forty-six years l've been lending money on good old-fashioned principles.
And l stand here now to tell you one and all...
...that l've never been offered a better piece of collateral...
...than l hold in my hand right now. Chair.
What did you say?
You heard me. Henry Drummond.
Keep them close to the vest. madam.
Close to your vest.
Nobody sees those cards but you and C.P. Ballinger. Sam?
-Yes. sir?
-Bring some chips in here. Lots of chips.
Yes. sir.
Hold this. son. l don't like to sweat in a new hat.
Just blues. please.
Blues are a hundred dollars apiece. l presume.
Make it 55 to start with.
Don't go away.
Now. how much did you say you needed to stick. madam?
She needs $500.
Five hundred.
Four. five. Now. let's play some poker.
The good old-fashioned way.
Let's you and me and the Cattle and Merchants Bank...
...just raise the bet once again.
You gentlemen want to stay in the game...
...you'll have to put in another 5000 apiece.
Of course. you understand there's the usual interest charge. 7 percent.
Make it 6.
Lend a hand. sonny.
-l've won?
-That you have. madam. That you have. lf you don't mind. ma'am. could l take a look at your cards?
Mr. Buford. the game is called poker.
The lady doesn't have to show her hand.
-You ought to read the rules sometime.
-How true.
-Sam. cash me in. l'm going home.
-Yes. sir. Mr. Wilcox.
-Home?
-Yeah. home.
To my wife.
Coming. Ben?
The Cattle and Merchants lent you a sum total of $5500.
At 6 percent. that makes another $330.
-Now. how did you care to pay that off?
-Oh. right now. all at once.
That's the way to do business.
Now. if l may escort you to the lobby. madam...
...we can exchange these chips for cash.
Oh. will it take very long?
But one minute. madam.
Only one minute.
-Well. because l want to see my husband.
-Toby...
-...get a buggy ready.
-Right away. Mr. Ballinger.
Ma'am. lt's been a pleasure. ma'am.
A very great pleasure.
Shut up.
-To Doc Scully's you say. madam?
-Yes. and can we hurry. please?
Be there in a jiffy.
-Let's go. sonny.
-Giddyup.
-Henry.
-Yeah?
How many good women have you met in your life? l mean good women.
Otto?
One.
Papa. Mama!
Henry!
How was it. Pa?
Welcome home. Henry.
Welcome home.
-Mama.
-Oh. l told you he'd be back.
Hello there. Drummond.
Welcome. Mr. Drummond. Dad.
Oh. Papa. Papa. Pa.
-Who won?
-You shut up.
What'd you do. sleep in that dress?
She ain't had it off since you left. Henry.
That'd be bad luck.
All right. everybody. let's get ready now.
Mr. Monckton. first thing. let everybody know...
-...that Henry's home--
-Now. just a minute.
-Henry. we've got a lot to do.
-You got nothing to do till l tell you.
You. come with me. l said. come with me.
Yes. Mr. Drummond. Dad.
Where are you going?
Well. what are you going to do?
-Mama!
-Henry.
Here.
-Sit down. Arthur.
-But l--
-l said. sit down.
-Yes. sir. ls this chair all right?
Sir?
Thank you. Mr. Drummond.
How old are you. Arthur?
-Twenty-six. Mr. Drummond.
-Ceely's 32.
-Oh. but l can take good care of her.
-Shut up. l'm talking.
Never interrupt when l'm talking.
-What are you marrying her for?
-What?
Stop asking questions. l'm asking the questions.
What are you marrying her for?
Well. Mr. Drummond. Ceely and me. we love each other--
No. you don't.
You're marrying Ceely because your old man...
...figures it's one way to get his hooks into my property. l know it. he knows it. and you know it.
Now then. why is Ceely marrying you?
Because she love--
Because she's homely as a lemon and just as sneaky as her old lady.
And every man sets foot in this house needs just one look...
...to figure it ain't worth 40.000 acres and a soft spot for the rest of his life. ls that what you were gonna say?
-Yes. sir.
-Now you're talking sense.
Arthur. l want you to light out of that window right there...
...and shinny down the rain pipe. and get on my horse...
...and get the hell and gone away from us and your old man as far as you can get.
And don't waste any time. Arthur.
There's a whole world waiting for you out there.
Good places and bad places.
Nice people and some not so nice.
Look them all over. Arthur.
Bide your time.
And maybe somewhere. someplace. you'll find a real woman.
A good woman.
Now get.
Why are you doing this.
Mr. Drummond?
Find one that will love. honor and obey you. Arthur.
Find one that will comfort you in sickness and in health.
-Get.
-Yes. sir.
Find a good one. Arthur.
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for you.
Bar was so crowded downstairs. took me a long time to get a drink.
-Has the game started?
-Not yet.
-Ninety-four twenty.
-That's 9420 to you. C.P.
That's the stake and your raise.
And one-fifth of the net receipts. 3300.
One-fifth of the net receipts. 3300.
That's 3300 to you. Ruby.
Thirty-three hundred to you. Doc.
And for me. and 3300 for Jackie.
How about this citizen?
Can l pick a crew or can l pick a crew?
You can pick them. Benny.
Time for bed. big fella.
-Do l have to go to bed?
-Yeah. we gotta get up bright and early. l promised your old man l'd get you back to the carnival in time for church.
Now. say good night to everybody.
-Good night. Doc.
-Good night.
-Good night. Ruby.
-Good night. honey.
-Give your mama my love.
-l will.
Howdy-do?
Howdy--
How do you do. how do you do? l want to thank you. C.P. for cutting me in on this deal.
You were Ruby's choice.
And a very happy one. my boy.
A very happy choice indeed.
Yeah. well.
-l have just one small suggestion.
-Yeah? l wouldn't show my face around Laredo again if l were you. lf any of them suspicioned how we cheated them....
Cheat?
We didn't cheat them. we bluffed them.
That's the nature of the game. l am shocked at you. C.P.
We may have bluffed them with a few extra trimmings...
...but it was within the spirit of the game. l am horrified that you think that we would cheat.
-No offense.
-That's not the point.
Bedtime. Jackie.
Be seeing you.
What are you gonna do with your money?
Benny. you know Roscoe Busby?
Do l know Roscoe Busby?
Well. Roscoe come up with a proposition....
When are you going back to Laredo. C.P.?
Oh. tomorrow. the day after.
When do you go back. Joseph?
Who knows?
Doc?
What do you hear out there?
New Orleans? Chicago?
After 40 years of fixing their chilblains and frostbite. bellyache and pip...
...l figure they owe me this.
They owe me a little vacation.
-Joseph.
-Yes?
You gave a great performance.
Sweet revenge. huh. C.P.?
You bet it is.
How many years ago they cheated you in their real-estate deal?
Sixteen years it's taken me to get my money back.
But l've got it. l've got it.
What do you intend to do with all that money?
-Oh. you know. C.P.
-l do?
Well. we play big poker here in Black Creek.
Ruby.
-You promised me.
-Promised what. C.P.?
You said if l got you a big stake you'd give up poker. l didn't say for good.
Now. you know l couldn't do that.
You gave me your solemn word. l did not. l never did.
Ruby. you're lying again.
Ruby. Ruby. Ruby. come back here.
You know we talked this all over.
We talked. C.P.. sure. but l never promised.
You did. You promised me on your word of honor.
Crossed your heart and hoped you'd die that you would never play another game.
You weren't listening.
You weren't listening. what l said--
What you said was that you would never sit in on another poker game...
...if you came out with a big enough stake from Laredo.
Ruby--
Ruby. listen to me.
Why do you want to bring on those palpitations? l'll bring on palpitations if l feel like it.
-Ruby.
-Honey. a girl's gotta have some fun.
-Ruby. please.
-Now. C.P.
What am l supposed to do when you're sitting in your big fat bank in Laredo...
...and l'm waiting for you here in Black Creek? l'm in. boys. l only see you once every six weeks.
-Hello. Steamboat.
-Hello there. Ruby.
-Ruby.
-Quiet. C.P.
Let's play cards.
-Hello. Benny.
-Ruby.
-No limit poker?
-l assumed as much.
Western rules on betting?
Ante a hundred?
That's what l like to hear. Gentlemen?
Doc. Doc. they're playing.
So am l. my boy. So am l.
-Five-card draw.
-Ruby!

$496. All right.
Sam, that's $108,256.14.
What's your pleasure, folks?
We've hit it big, and we're buyin'!
Sam, all this means to me is Jenny, and getting her up here.
George, a wonderful thing about Alaska is that matrimony hasn't hit up here yet.
- Let's keep it a free country.
- You're backing down, Sam.
- You're breaking your promise!
- I never break a promise, but...
I don't understand. Now you're a millionaire, you keep wanting to enslave yourself.
- I can't wait to get enslaved, Sam!
- Well, quit shakin', Uncle Tom.
I'll fetch her back.
Sam, darling!
Georgie Pratt, the lovin' limey!
No, thank you, lady. I'm spoken for.
It's all right, mister. Your virtue is safe.
Billy Pratt. How you've grown.
- Well, I'm glad it's noticeable.
- How old are you now?
- Not old enough.
- Don't believe him. I'm 20, ma'am.
You're 17, and you'll hold yourself in until you find the right one, like I did.
What are you, my brother or my mother?
George!
Here, Sam. Have some of what you're buyin'.
I always like free liquor!
Hear you hit one of the biggest gold strikes around.
We'll know better when I get back from
Seattle with the heavy diggin' equipment.
All right, folks. Quiet down.
- Quiet!
- Shut up!
We'll drink to the twitchingest nose for gold in the whole territory of Alaska:
My partner, George Pratt!
And here's to George's fiance, who's been pinin' away in Seattle for three years waitin' for him to become a millionaire -
Jenny Lamont!
- When are you bringing her up, George?
- I ain't. Sam is.
That's like sending a rabbit to fetch you back a piece of lettuce!
Somebody's gotta keep you thieves from jumping the claim. Anyway,
- Sam's better at buying machinery than I am.
- I'll tell you somethin' else he's better at!
I gotta stay and build our honeymoon cabin.
George builds the cabin, and Sam takes the honeymoon!
All right, you've had your fun.
I'll lay you five to one, George Pratt, your first kid has a squint and a wrinkled brow!
That ain't very funny, mister!
Girls!
Hey, look at the dames!
Hey! Girls!
Girls?!
Hey! There's a whole shipload of new girls!
- Not a bad fight?
- Interesting.
What I wanna know is, who's gonna pay for this mess?
- Mess?
- Don't worry, greasehead.
It was worth it.
Our Jenny has been vindicated.
Oh, thank you, Mr McCord!
Well, Clancy. Thank you.
I'd better get steam-cleaned and shaved before I get on that boat.
Sam, I'm relying on you.
Don't you get drunk or arrested.
- George, I gave you my promise.
- Yeah
I'll meet you on the beach with Jenny's ticket.
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Howdy.
I didn't expect to find luxuries of this nature out here.
- Just come in?
- Yeah, yesterday.
Boy, it sure is hot!
Say, didn't I see you about six months ago in Seattle?
No.
- Great town, Seattle.
- Yeah.
I hated to leave, but the gold fever got me packin'.
It's a big fever.
Hey, that's all right!
My name's Frank Canon.
- Sam McCord.
- That's a real dinger. "Big fever"!
Forgot my soap. Be right back.
- Why, you thievin' little...
- Wait a minute! I wasn't doing anything!
Don't lie to me, you robber! I saw ya!
- What are you doin'? I didn't do anything!
- You thieving little skunk!
- That rat was going through your clothes.
- What's goin' on?
- I caught a thief going through his clothes.
- I'm sorry.
The town's filling up with riffraff.
I can't watch them all.
Cool down, mister. He'd have come up empty. My money's in this bag.
I'm sorry, but... dishonesty always makes me see red.
No harm done. I'll buy you a drink.
No, no. I always insist on buying the first one.
The Canons have been like that as long as I can remember. My father used to...
- You won't believe this!
- What's the joke?
While I was looking out for you, that bum robbed me! Took everything but my pants!
- $5, please.
- You strapped, mister?
It's embarrassing.
It's nothing serious. I'll get the money from the States in a few days.
Won't hurt to lose a few pounds dieting.
I forgot! Frankie's silver lining.
I almost forgot it. I'll be able to get the money on that little bauble.
You can get the money right here.
For trying to save my poke,
I'll give you a coupla hundred.
- The diamond's worth $5,000 easy.
- Well, how much do you need?
There might be some delay in getting my money from the States.
Say a thousand.
Say five hundred.
- You can't ask for better security.
- Here's your five.
Kinda foolish to trust a stranger with a hunk of diamond like that.
Not at all, Mr McCord.
I can always tell an honest face.
- Yeah, but I'm goin' outta town.
- Makes no difference.
I'll be around when you get back.
- What is this, corn or whiskey?
- Just ask for what you want, mister.
$5,000, eh?
That crooked jeweller must have... must have switched stones?
Well, I guess that... guess that about makes us even.
- Not quite.
- Hm?
- I wonder what's happened to Billy.
- That kid?
He's probably tailing the dance-hall girls.
Sam! Sam, wait a minute.
Now, look. Here's your ticket.
And... here's a letter to Jenny.
- It's kind of personal.
- I won't look!
Well, you know how it is after three years.
And here's her picture. Look at that face.
Look at those eyes, look at that smile.
The best part's missing: the figure.
"Nature's masterpiece", I call her.
I've been listening to this for three years.
- Pretty near wore out lookin' at it.
- Don't... don't bend it.
And you will tell her that I have to stay here, and that I'm building the cabin?
- I'll tell her.
- I'm awful grateful, Sam.
You don't know what Jenny means to me.
All that gold in Alaska? Not worth her little finger! You know how it is.
No, I never felt that way about a woman.
But I'll take your word for it.
Hey, mister! You for the Victoria Queen?
- Comin' right up.
- Shovin' off, sir.
Sam... Sam, my whole life's in your hands.
I'll deliver her to you, partner.
Christmas wrappings.
- You sure love that gal, don't ya?
- Yeah, I do.
More than... more than even you.
- Come on, mister!
- See you in a month.
I sure fooled you fellas, didn't I?
- Yeah.
- Am I gonna make a big splash in Seattle!
You're gonna make a big splash right here!
No!
Traitor! Everybody's trying to save me from everything!
That'll cool him off!
Thank you, Sam! You should have waited till you were further out!
Oh, you fool kid! What do I have to do, put a chain around your neck?
Well, it ain't fair. I'll be an old man before I learn the facts of life.
Sam McCord never did a crooked thing in his life, and don't you forget it!
Hey, mister.
Mister?
Mister! What did that man say about Sam McCord?
- Why? Have you got something to say too?
- Take it easy.
- I'm Sam's friend. I'm his partner.
- You are?
Well, what do you know!
This is a small world, isn't it?
My name's Frankie Canon.
Where is Sam? I heard he was in town.
- I've been looking all over for him.
- Sam's just left on a boat to Seattle.
My name's George Pratt.
This is my kid brother, Billy.
This is an unexpected pleasure, bumping into Sam's partner.
I'm going to have some grub.
Why don't you join me?
- Mighty friendly of you.
- I'm a greenhorn in this town.
I was kind of counting on Sam to help me...
Well, you just follow me, Mr Canon.
This is my lucky day. Come on.
Are you sure this is 799 Perry Avenue?
Oh, yes, sir. This is 799.
Good old George.
Bragged about everything... except that she was a duchess.
- Yes?
- Miss Jenny Lamont live here, mister?
Deliver all packages in the rear.
Tradesmen's entrance.
I'm no tradesman.
Tell Jenny I'm here from Alaska with tokens from George Pratt.
- You are George Pratt?
- No, I'm his partner, Sam McCord.
Follow me, please.
Where are you takin' me?
Jenny? A gentleman to see you.
Me? I do not know this man.
- What does he want?
- The name is Sam McCord, and I'm here as a representative of George Pratt.
- Oh, him.
- You'll be happy to hear he's in fine health, and I'm here to fetch you back to Alaska for the wedding.
- The wedding?!
- Yes.
I'm sorry, it is impossible. The engagement with Monsieur George Pratt is long over.
Aw, Jenny, I've got a letter here that'll explain everything.
Least it ought to.
It took him two weeks to write it.
- What are all those packages for?
- Those are the presents for the bride.
And that's not all of 'em.
These are just the doodads.
The important ones are piled back in the hotel.
But it is over. I am married.
This is my husband.
- Married?
- Show him the ring, my love.
Well, that stupid lunkhead George.
Pinin' away for three years for you.
He never laid a finger on anybody, just holdin' himself for her.
A million dollars?!
Is this true about the strike?
- A million dollars?
- Sure. But a lot of good it'll do him, sittin' on a pile of gold, moanin' for his two-timing fiancée.
A million dollars, you're sure?
- A mill...
- Yes.
Women!
I never met one yet that was half as reliable as a horse.
- Please, sir, this way out. The back door.
- I never use it.
Another thing about Alaska, the polar bear.
He can go for six months without any attentions.
No!
But after six months, a polar bear gets a little nervous, and starts clawin' up his fellow animals to death.
Now, it's the same way with a gold miner.
Reinforcements! That's what we like.
Hey, Lil! Keep 'em comin'!
Sit down, missy.
I still have one unoccupied knee.
You have a real snooty look, missy.
And I don't like dames that have snooty looks.
I met one female today who broke my partner's heart, and you are not helping me to forget it.
I'm sorry your heart is broken.
But we are all good doctors, aren't we, girls?
Not my heart. George Pratt's heart.
Broken right down the middle by a fickle dame in a lace cap.
Let me be your doctor.
Forgive the mistake. I should have seen that you're not the kind of man that would let a woman break his heart.
You're too tall and too strong.
- That accent. Where did you get it?
- I'm sorry you don't like the way I speak.
I didn't say I didn't admire your speaking.
I was just askin', is it put-on or natural?
- But it's natural. I'm French.
- Yes, she is French.
Pipe down. I'm tryin' to think.
Real French, eh? Not one of them phoney ooh-la-las we get up in Nome?
I'll give you 50 bucks for a straight answer.
Girls, he's all yours. Good night, monsieur.
"Monsieur"! That does it. I buy.
- Hey, hold on. Where are you going?
- Let go.
- You have enough admirers to...
- Moody, too. George'll like that.
- He hasn't got any sense.
- Let me go. You're hurting me...
I wanna talk business.
Well, good night, ladies, and here you are.
For being such nice girls and showing your legs and good dispositions.
March 'em out, Irving.
And, Irving, tell the management
I'm through shopping for the night.
Well, you've got a lot of drinking to catch up on.
French. The real thing, just like you.
- Well, I'm savin' a life, that's all I know.
- Maybe, but you don't make any sense at all.
Which is all right, because if you're too drunk to talk, we'll find something else to do.
- That's perfect. You even sound like a wife.
- I do not consider that a compliment.
I'm on your side, lady.
It's my only politics: anti-wife.
Any woman who devotes herself to making one man miserable instead of a lot of men happy don't get my vote.
Sit down.
Thank you.
- What's your name?
- I'm called Angel.
- Sounds dangerous. What else?
- Michelle. Michelle Bonnet.
- And you?
- Sam McCord.
Sam McCord, I drink to you.
Because I can always tell when I like a man.
First, by my fingers. They get warm.
Feel.
Second, when he is willing to act like a gentleman for a few minutes.
You know, when I was leaving before,
I was only pretending.
I was going to come back, and try again.
Look... I've got a proposition to make you.
- Naturally.
- Have you ever been to Alaska?
No! Too cold for my type.
I'm from New Orleans, where it's always warm.
- You're about the right size.
- Oh. You have second sight, I see.
Try this on.
Here?!
Don't you think there is too many distractions?
- But if you wish...
- Oh, I meantjust try it for size.
Mr McCord, you're wasting your time.
- I'm selling, not buying.
- "Buying"?
How would you like to have all of this stuff free, no charge?
And half a gold mine to go with it.
Just say the word.
- What word?
- Just a little old "yes",
- and it's all yours.
- You're fooling me.
I was never more serious in my life.
I'm saving a human being, the best pal a fella ever had.
Nobody has ever given me anything as nice as this before.
When I heard that accent,
I said "That's for George."
A Frenchie broke his heart, a Frenchie can fix it.
I'm going to tell you a secret.
I don't know, I'm shaking from head to foot.
Because it finally happened.
Instead ofjumping into the bay,
I'm going to jump into a gold mine.
And, mister, am I going to jump!
I mean Sam McCord, you really want me to go to Alaska with you?
Just say the word.
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
Come right this way, Mr Nordquist.
He's right in here.
Hey, Sam! Come up for air.
Lars Nordquist! You old coot! How are ya?
- I'm fine! How are you?
- Come on in, svenska.
Shame on you, hangin' around a place like this.
Where else will I hang around when I'm looking for my old friend Sam McCord?
- I heard that you hit gold in Alaska.
- Big!
Oh, I'm so happy for you!
I see that you hit pretty good here in Seattle, too.
- Oh, this is... What was that name?
- Michelle Bonnet.
Angel's easier.
This is Lars, my old loggin' boss.
- A mean man with an axe.
- Hello, Mr Lars.
Well, shake hands with her.
Your wife ain't lookin'.
How is Lena? Still bouncin' a rolling pin off your skull?
Oh, she's slowing down.
But she's crazy to see you again, Sam.
Crazy to feed you up again.
What are you doin' in Seattle?
The whole gang is here for the loggers' picnic.
We heard that Sam McCord was in town.
Everybody starts hollering "You can't have a loggers' picnic without Sam McCord!"
- Come on!
- Well...
Go on, Mr McCord. I'll give you my address in case you want to see me again.
The name is Sam, and I'm tattooin' you on my arm until we get to Alaska!
Now pick up your trousseau, Angel, and let's go.
I don't know where to begin.
- Well, let's start here.
- I'll help.
Oh, it's such a lovely suit, Sam.
And it fits so perfectly.
Everything. The shoes, the hat...
I hope I look all right for the picnic.
- You look great for anyplace. Lars?
- Sure, sure.
What's the matter, Lars? You lost your laugh.
No.
Lena!
Lena!
You crazy, Sam!
That's my wife.
I bet you I know where Lars find you!
Some all-kind-of-crazy no-good place!
I told Lars "You go find Sam", but you don't fool around with any of those fancy girls or I split your head open!"
"Soon as you come home, I..."
Who is that woman?
- Lars, I told...!
- Wait a minute, Lena. That's my friend.
- I brought her along.
- She's no friend I know!
Oh, stop that white-pack howl and show some manners.
I want you to meet my friend Angel.
- Well, come on. She won't bite.
- Go on. See my Lena.
- This is my old friend Lena Nordquist.
- How do you do, Mrs Nordquist?
Well, come on, come on.
There's nothing to fear. She's half-human.
Well, it looks like a very nice picnic, and...
I'll just sit down on the grass, if you don't mind.
- You ain't sitting on any grass around here!
- You don't have to say any more.
No, you don't have to.
- Where are you going, Angel?
- Where I belong.
You belong with me.
I thought we were invited to a picnic, not an uprising of nutty wives, with war paint, which I am not interested in attending.
So my friend and I bid you goodbye, and are sorry that you find us unfit to sit on your lousy grass!
- Lena! He's leaving!
- Sam!
- What?
- Sam, wait a minute.
You are a pig-headed no-good, and you always were!
But you can't help it, just because no decent woman look at you for two seconds.
But if you care for to stay at the party, it's all right.
Her too!
Well, that invitation's kinda uncordial.
- I got the bad temper.
- Well, so have I.
How about you, Angel?
Well... I...
I'm kind of hungry, Sam.
We got lots to eat, right down there, barbecued pork, if you like it.
- Oh, I love it!
- Right down there.
Thank you.
Hey! Where do you think you're going, Mr Nordquist?
Well, what'll you have? A wing or a leg?
The apple!
Attention!
All the men in the log-rolling contest please report to the committee now!
Are you going to take part in any of the games?
If they have a wife-strangling contest,
I mightjoin that.
All wives are the same. You know, someone comes near their husband, and off they go, like burglar alarms!
Well, what I can't stand is when people look down on others who aren't doing 'em any harm.
Oh, Sam. You cannot change the world.
And it's... it's so nice here, and that's enough.
You're good medicine.
Thank you.
Refill?
Yes, but not too much?
Be right back.
Angel!
Don't you remember me?
- I'm Ole, the logger.
- Oh, please go away.
- I was going to come up to see you tonight.
- No, I said please go away.
- Nobody's looking.
- I said go away!
No!
- I said go away!
- No!
Go away!
Let me go!
Brought you some coffee, too.
- Thank you.
- Sit down?
Yes.
Wasn't that man a friend of yours?
Sure. Still is, or will be, when he sobers up.
- Well, why did you do it, then?
- Habit, I guess.
I guess a fella gets sore, and...
What's the matter? Haven't you ever had a fella fight over you before?
Well, over me, yes, but... never for me.
Well, I...
- I guess I got sore, that's all.
- Why did you get sore?
Well, how do I know?
A fella gets sore, that's all!
- He works it off, that's all.
- Hey, Sam!
Sam! Sam, Jensson's so drunk that he can't enter the pole-climbing contest.
- You got to help me.
- Yeah, he can't climb poles.
- I got a big bet on with Oscar.
- Me too!
- What do you want me to do about it?
- Climb pole! If you don't help, I lose my shirt.
I haven't had spurs on for who knows how long.
- It'll be like yesterday since you climb pole!
- Or early this morning.
- You might still lose your shirt.
- I'll take a chance on you!
Sam McCord climbs for Nordquist!
- You ever seen a man climb a pole?
- No.
- Sam McCord climbs for Nordquist!
- Well, it looks like I'm hooked.
Sam, come on!
- Sam, you're not going to go up there?!
- How do you think I used to make a living?
- He go up there like a squirrel!
- Ole?
Hey, you bummer, Beyerhauser!
Look out for my boy Sam here!
It's a fine thing you done to an old friend.
You could have told me she was your girl, and I'd go away like a gentleman.
I'm sorry, Ole. I apologise.
Now I'm gonna ask a favour of you, like a gentleman.
- What do you want?
- I want you to take care of Angel.
See no one bothers her.
Give me your hand on it.
Ja, sure! I kick the stuffings out of anyone who get fresh with Sam McCord's girl.
Now I don't have to worry about ya.
You got a chaperon.
This way, Miss Angel.
Ready... set...
Go on! Sam, go!
Come on! Quick!
Quiet! Quiet, quiet!
The winner for Nordquist,
Sam McCord, in 58 seconds!
Beer for everybody!
We drink to Sam McCord, the winner of the pole-climbing contest!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
You've drunk to me four times already!
Well, make it five!
Let's drink to one of the finest ladies in Seattle:
Lena Nordquist!
Thank you, thank you!
And now let's drink to another fine lady.
- Angel.
- You betcha!
Everybody drink to another fine lady, Angel!
- Well, thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.
- And a big drink to Sam McCord!
Hold your horses! Hold your horses!
I am still drinking to the other one!
To you, Angel.
Well... thank you, Lena.
Thank you, Sam.
All right. Now, come on, everybody, you're falling behind.
Fill them up! We've got lots more toasts to drink!
Yes, sir.
Oh, my goodness!
It has started.
Skall
Now we make another toast:
To the finest boss the loggers ever had!
He's always treating the loggers like gentlemen, Lars Nordquist!
To the finest boss... the loggers...
He will have to pass.
All right, so now we call on the best logger that ever run away to Alaska,
Sam McCord, the Paul Bunyan of the pole-climbers!
Well, I'm afraid that the Paul Bunyan of the pole-climbers will have to pass.
Don't be mad on him.
They were just having fun.
- I will help you take care of Sam, honey.
- Thank you, Lena.
I'm sure I'll be able to take care of him myself.
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Good morning.
What time is it?
Noon of a beautiful day.
This hotel's rockin'.
- This is a boat!
- Of course it's a boat.
- Where's it going?
- Alaska.
Alaska. Oh.
Music. I... I still hear music.
The gramophone. I moved everything from the hotel, after I found the two tickets.
Tickets.
Tickets?
Angel!
- You came along.
- You asked me. Don't you remember?
Oh, Sam, it's wonderful!
When I woke up this morning, I felt something wonderful had happened to me.
I felt different. I felt like I used to be.
Oh, Sam, you'll never be sorry.
I'll take such good care of you.
You may not believe it, but I can cook, I can sew...
Hold it, honey. Hold it.
I...
I remember, but... not quite the same way you remember.
- Is there anything wrong, Sam?
- No, nothing wrong. It's just...
- Are you sorry you asked me?
- No, that isn't it.
If I said anything to upset you, please tell me.
No, I told you, you're fine. It's just that there's some misunderstanding.
I thought I told you about George.
Yes, you told me his fiancée left him, and he's heartbroken.
That's right. His heart is broken, not mine.
I thought you could help him, not me.
Oh.
- I'm sorry. I misunderstood.
- Well, honest, I thought I told ya.
You... you must have told me, but...
I heard something else.
I heard something nice.
Well, I wasn't trying to hurt ya.
I was trying to help.
- And George as well.
- Forgive me.
I must have picked up some poison ivy on that picnic, and... just a little painful.
I wouldn't hurt a kid like you for anything.
I thought you were all steamed up about goin' to Alaska.
Well, I... I think I've changed my mind.
I... I'd rather go back where I belong.
Let's have breakfast.
Then we'll both feel different.
No, thank you.
I'm... I'm full up, I guess.
Aw, come on. Open up.
I'll play you a game of red dog.
Cassino. I'll spot you ten points.
Women.
Peculiar.
She's not answering the door, Mr McCord.
- Should I slip it under?
- No, I'll take care of it. Is she eatin' good?
- Yes, sir. I'm taking good care of her.
- Well, take better care of her.
Thank you.
Oh.
Good evening, Sam. May I join you?
Well, sure. Come on in.
Sit down.
How've you been?
- I've been thinking things over.
- Me too.
- And I'm sorry I was so ungrateful.
- Well, you had a perfect right to be sore.
That was a dumb idea to begin with, dragging you along because I wanted to help a pal over some bumps.
Let's just forget the whole thing.
Besides, I don't wanna end up being a Cupid to any George Pratt.
Will he be very unhappy?
I'll get blamed for everything. He found the mine, he saved my life, and I let him down.
That's the way this fella figures.
He's very emotional.
- Is he older than you?
- No, he's younger.
- He claims.
- Is he big and strong?
- Oh...
- Is he fat, or short?
- No, but...
- And he is rich?
- Yes, he is rich.
- That's very funny,
My turning down such a man.
Oh, please, forget whatever I said before.
I'll be very glad to make your friend George happy if I can.
No! It's no good.
- But let me try for a week or two.
- No dice.
This is what you wanted from the first time you saw me.
Look, Angel, I changed my mind, the same as you.
Why, Sam?
Because it's a crazy idea, and I don't want you to get hurt, and... I like you.
Is that a reason to get rid of a girl?
It's one of the best, unless you're a sucker for trouble.
I'm not thinking of myself alone.
You're a nice kid.
I don't want to put you on the spot.
- What kind of a spot?
- Well, let's put it this way.
Where there are two men and one girl on top of a mountain, it's trouble.
And I don't think it's smart to import it.
So let's just call it a boat ride, and I'll see that you don't lose anything for having taken it.
Yes. Yes, I think you're right, Sam.
It would make your friend George unhappy if I fell in love with you, and who knows, maybe you'd feel unhappy if I fell in love with a nice man like George.
So, the best thing is, I disappear from Alaska.
Well, I'm glad you agree with me.
How can I help agreeing with a man who's so kind and so honourable?
And so wise.
Good night, Sam.
Good night.
- Captain?
- Morning, Mr McCord.
- Have a nice trip?
- No complaints.
It's going to take some time to get your equipment ashore.
Yeah, I know.
There's a personal matter, Captain.
- Miss Bonnet.
- Nice girl.
- Sorry to lose her.
- You ain't losin' her.
She's goin' back to Seattle with you.
But we are going up to Kotzebue before returning to Seattle.
That's all right. She just came along for the ride. $300 be enough for a return passage?
- Plenty.
- There's $500.
Two extra to kinda keep an eye on her.
I'll watch her like a father, Mr McCord.
And... here's another $500. Give that to her when she gets off at Seattle.
- Sort of a refund from the company.
- I've got you, Mr McCord.
They don't usually come that ladylike.
Hey, hold it there! There's one more!
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- I thought you were gonna stay on the boat.
Well, I thought so too, but then something said "Go ashore, Michelle."
- "Go ashore, and your fortune will be made."
- Did that something tell ya
- that Nome is no place for a girl like you?
- Like me?
What is my kind of place, Sam?
Well, I guess I've been taking care of you for so long that...
I forgot you can take care of yourself.
But it was fun being looked after, even for a little while. And I thank you.
You're welcome.
I guess I can see about a room at the hotel for you, for a parting gift.
Won't you be coming into town from your mine?
Oh, sure, once every six months.
Oh, I... I see.
I don't see George anywhere.
When he hears about Jenny, he's gonna get hysterical and bust me in the nose, or else try to drown himself.
He's a nice guy, but about Jenny he just ain't normal.
That's the trouble with being in love.
Even drowning is a relief.
- Oh, very funny. You just stay out of this.
- Me? Of course.
- I'm just going to have a hot bath and...
- Hey, Sam!
- Sam!
- Breezy!
You stay right here.
Breezy! Where's George?
At the mine. He wants you to bring
Jenny there as fast as you can.
- Something wrong?
- There's been claim-jumpin' and cross-filin'.
Him and Billy are sittin' up there with loaded guns.
- That bad?
- There's been killings, too.
I was cross-filed myself last week.
They took my poke, including everything.
George gave me ajob, and I got a coupla wagons to help you haul that stuff off to the mine.
Here are the invoices. Wait till they beach the equipment. I gotta go back to the hotel.
I'm your man.
Bags are just inside the door, lady.
- You got $4 change comin', mister.
- Forget it.
You can't get a room. We're all filled up.
- Hello, Mr McCord.
- I'd like a room and a bath for the lady.
I'm sorry, we're all full up. Everything's gone.
Everything? Well, where else could I get her a room with a little privacy?
You might try Phil's livery stable.
They turned it into a hotel.
A livery stable? I'll talk to Bish.
He's the owner of the joint.
Bish? Everett Bishop?
- Over here, Sam.
- Bish, I want...
What kind of an outfit is this for a proprietor?
I'm not the proprietor any more.
One queen did it. One lousy queen.
- You lost the hotel?
- Sam, I had two aces back to back, and this guy had one queen showing, and it was the last draw.
Now, I ask you, would you bet a hotel or not?
One queen? Who pulled that third queen?
- One lousy queen.
- I'll paint you a skinny one.
I don't want a skinny one, but I don't want one with a rear end like a bass drum!
- All right, I'll paint a pancake!
- You couldn't paint...
Sam! Welcome to the Royal Palace Hotel.
I'm rejuvenating the place.
Art. I'm introducing art to Alaska.
Along with dealing off the bottom?
Sam, we're both rich men.
Why do we have to quarrel?
If you and the lady would like a room...
I'm out. The room is for Miss Bonnet.
A room and a bath for herself alone.
I'm sure I have just what you wish.
I'd like to use this opportunity to wipe out all our past disappointments.
As a friend of yours, she is a guest of the house. I'll take care of your luggage.
Boggs? Boggs!
That guy annoys me.
Have you ever seen him before?
Why do you ask?
- You don't know him, eh?
- No.
- Well, watch out for him.
- Why?
Don't let him try to sell you anything.
- I'll keep my money in my shoe.
- Well, it's for your own good.
A crook like that's bad news for everybody.
Thank you. I appreciate your concern.
Well, I... got to get out to the mine.
You will come and say goodbye before you leave?
I'll try. No hard feelings?
No. Just something that didn't work out.
Too loony, as you say.
Well...
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

Next time I catch you mooching drinks, you're fired. Now, come on.
Take the lady's bags up to my suite.
Miss Bonnet?
- Can I open the window for ya, or...
- Mr Boggs?
"Miss Bonnet"? Oh, that's wonderful!
Angel, it's been a long time.
Oh, you're onto something big.
Come on, tell Frankie all about it.
If you kept a diary, Frankie, which I'm sure you wouldn't dare, you'd read where it says that you have no right to ask me anything.
Oh, now, wait a minute, Angel.
We've both got a lot to overlook.
- You walked out on me.
- I didn't walk. I ran.
- No explanation...
- Not even a wedding ring.
I got fed up, Frankie. Fed up with being used.
- Did you have to get rough?
- You helped me to learn how, remember?
Look, why the bellyachin'?
It didn't hurt you any.
You're twice as beautiful as you were in New Orleans.
You've turned out to be a real Venus.
Don't I deserve a little credit?
Oh, honey, it hit me real big when I saw you, right here.
It brought back everything.
Those happy days and... nights.
We're gonna start all over again, on a grand scale.
Oh, so you're all hooked up, eh?
- With Sam McCord.
- Keep out of it, Frankie.
Don't worry, Angel. I'm on your side.
It's hunky-dory with me if you waltz off with his gold mine. I'm no interference.
I've my own interests. Sam McCord is yours, and the rest of the world is mine. Fair split?
All I'm asking for is a little old-fashioned friendliness.
It's all gone, Frankie.
Dead, like if it was never born.
Oh... You're straight.
- I've told you.
- I never would have imagined it.
You're in love with this big bum McCord.
Look, let me give you a little friendly advice?
It's no good. Don't change.
You know what love does to a dame?
Takes all the zing out of her.
And that's respectability. That's the end.
I'm asking you sincerely, be yourself.
Don't wind up a Mother Hubbard, with a bunch of kids hollering in your ear!
This respectability, it's not good for you.
- Get out of my way.
- No need to leave. I'm goin'.
Keep the room.
But I'm a patient man, and what's more,
I have a lot of faith in you. Think it over.
If you ever need a little... friendliness, just call for Frankie.
What's still out there?
A donkey engine, some pumps, and the rest of the pipe.
Me and the big wagon won't follow you out for another day.
I don't give a damn.
Just get it out to the mine.
And don't hang around town and get drunk.
- Drunk? You know I never drink on the job!
- You can always start!
What's got into you since we landed?
You've been as ornery as a bear with a skinned behind!
Well, I'm sorry, Breezy.
See you out at the mine.
Yah!
Get away! I told you, get away from me or I'll scream!
All I want to do is get out of here!
And don't you lay a hand on me either?
You! What do I owe for that room?
That "private suite".
Everybody knocking on my door.
What do they think I am?
A part of the hotel service? No!
Here! And take my name off your register!
- But I don't understand.
- Don't stop me! I'm getting out of here!
- That tinhorn Frankie?
- The hotel is full of Frankies.
Well, I read her wrong.
A gold mine.
- Now where's that livery stable?
- Are you crazy?
- You can't sleep with horses.
- And don't be insulting!
I'm sorry. Forgive me, but I'm so upset.
- I'll sleep on the beach. I'll sleep anywhere.
- You can't. You'll catch cold.
I don't care.
I should have listened to you and stayed on the boat. I was a fool, I guess.
Fine time to admit it, after the boat has sailed!
I don't know what's the matter with me.
I never cried like that before.
I'll tell you what's the matter with you.
You're a... a hoodoo!
That's what you are, a hoodoo!
Get in the wagon.
Move over and quit bawling!
- Where are you taking me?
- To the mine.
- But what about the boat?
- I'll get you back in plenty of time.
Yah!
I could have been sittin' in his pants today if I only had a brain in my head.
Yes, sir, Mr Canon. I built that shack up where him and George Pratt's gold mine is.
If I had drank less whiskey and more water from that stream,
I'd probably have all that gold for myself.
- Boggsy, you lived in that cabin?
- Yeah.
- Did you stake a claim?
- No, I just ran a trap line.
Then I pulled out because
I was almost starvin' to death!
Do me a favour, Mr Canon.
Kick me. Kick me real hard.
Wait a minute.
Boggsy, you must have staked a claim.
Now, think hard.
Did you drive a stake into the ground?
- Put together a pile of stones?
- No! I wasn't interested in stones.
Maybe a couple of little stones.
- No.
- You miserable drunk.
Except when I was makin' a fire to cook on,
I put a couple of rocks together.
Boggsy!
That's a claim!
It's your gold, and it's your mine!
- You think so?
- Oh, absolutely!
You need a couple of drinks to help you think. I'll work it out with you in detail.
Now!
Oh, Sam! It's beautiful!
Beautiful?! Gives me the willies.
"Welcome Jenny."
Oh, his honeymoon cabin. How wonderful!
You're gonna stick to your promise?
No troubles?
No troubles, Sam. I'm just going to enjoy the scenery.
Well, I've done the best I can.
I just gotta face him.
- I think I'll just lie to him.
- Yes.
George!
George!
Billy!
Billy!
George!
They're probably workin' the sluice boxes.
I'll go dig up George.
I wouldn't wish this on a goat, but right now I wish you were Jenny.
I'll be right back.
Hiya, kid.
- Hold it! That thing's loaded.
- Sam! Boy, am I glad you're back!
Well, I'm not so sure I am. Where's George?
Arnie, that fella who had the mine by us in Dawson? He's in trouble.
- George went to give him a hand.
- I heard about the claim-jumping.
Some fellas tried, but Arnie run 'em off. But they swore they'd get a gang and come back.
Breezy told me about some killings.
I guess I'd better go over and give 'em a hand. Come on.
Saddle me a horse while I pick up a few things.
Is he that mad?
He's not even here. Over at another mine, fighting some claim-jumpers.
One good thing about that, them shootin' at him will take George's mind off Jenny.
Yes. A bullet through the head is always the best cure for love.
I gotta give him a hand.
Keep me away for a while.
- Are you going to leave me here alone?
- Make yourself at home. Billy's here.
- Who's Billy?
- George's little kid brother.
- How little?
- 17. But he's man enough to take care of you.
That's what I'm afraid of.
This here's the best of them.
He spooks a little now and then, but...
But what?
He... he thens a little now and spook...
- Is that Jenny?
- No, that's not Jenny.
She'll be a guest for a few days, so get your bedroll outside. She'll sleep in the cabin.
This is Billy, and that fleabag at your feet is Clancy.
I'll be back as soon as I can, Angel.
Take care of the mules.
So you're Billy? Well, I'm Michelle.
- What's the matter? You're cold?
- Oh, no. Nothing's the matter.
- Are you...
- Am I what?
Sam's girl?
No.
- You his sister?
- No.
- You're just a stranger?
- Yes, we met on the boat, and there weren't any rooms left in town, so Sam was kind enough to ask me up here
- until I get my boat back to Seattle.
- That's wonderful!
I mean, it's wonderful up here.
Clancy sure likes you. Now, don't you go away. I have to unhitch the team.
- You stay here. I'll be right back, OK?
- Yes.
Come on, Clancy.

Please get out.
Clancy, shame on you.
Behave yourself. Get out, OK? Get out.
Michelle? Do you want anything?
No.
Well, maybe some hot water.
I... I just heated a batch.
- No, thank you.
- Well, it's no trouble to pour you some.
Billy, I'm not taking a foot bath. I'm in the tub.
- All of you?
- Don't you open those curtains!
Je... Jehoshaphat!
All of her!
17. Just a little kid.
Well!
A... a welcome celebration to make you feel at home.
- Here. You... you sit here.
- Thank you.
Oh, golly, you smell good!
Thank you.
Whatever you're cooking smells good, too.
I'd rather smell you.
Shall we dine?
Dine? Oh, sure.
Excuse me. Silly.
Venison stew.
I'd love to taste it.
Oh! Sure.
How nice.
Does your brother allow you to drink?
I've been drinking since I'm grown up.
This here's French wine.
George was saving it for Jenny, but... you being French, it's the same if you drink it.
Let's say we knock off a couple.
Are you willing?
We'll see how the evening goes.
Look at that! George wired up the cork so he'd know if I got into it.
I hope nothing's wrong with it boilin' over like that!
- You game to taste it?
- Oh, I'm not afraid.
OK.
Mmm. It's delicious.
- How is it called?
- Champagne.
That's the only kind I ever drink.
I guess it went down the wrong way, but... any way's the right way as long as you get it down. Here, have some more.
There you go.
Here's where I stand, Michelle.
I got all the money I need.
No sense me working any more.
The next thing, gotta get myself a woman.
- A steady woman.
- Sure, while you're still in the prime of life.
You said it. See that box over there? Right there?
It's full of gold. Take all you want. I'm through messin' around with Sam and George.
From Fortymile to Dawson,
I've known women from one end of this frozen glacier to the other.
Blondes, brunettes, redheads...
You name 'em, I've known 'em.
Yes, sir, I've decided it's time for me to quiet down.
Be patient. The right girl will come along.
You know, I think a fella should be friends with an older woman.
I just can't stand these young girls.
You know, inexperienced, and nothing to offer.
Mm-hm.
Well, don't you think we should do the dishes and go to bed?
Well, it's OK with me. I'm game.
Fine. You go to bed, and I'll do the dishes.
Aw, heck. What's... what's the big rush?
I never get someone to talk to, girls, I mean.
Just Sam and George, and all they ever say is pester me to clean somethin' or cook somethin'.
Michelle...
I want you to be more than just a talkin' friend.
I don't know exactly how to put it.
I understand. You want me to be more like a... like a sister.
Oh, Michelle, please don't make fun of me.
I'm serious.
Michelle...
I'm serious.
I must be gettin' a little dizzy.
Yes, I think so.
You'd better lie down for a while.
- Michelle...
- No, no, no, no.
Here you go.
Come on.
No, no.
You can talk to me while I clear the table. All right?
Thanks. Thanks, Michelle.
Bull's-eye!
Hold it!
- Hold it!
- They got Arnie.
Hey, Duggan! He had this bundle of dynamite!
Tryin' to blow up the sluices and drown us!
- You dirty, claim-jumpin' thieves, you!
- Arnie, you just don't understand.
This is free territory. We've got as much right to the gold as you have.
Get up there!
Hold it!
George! George Pratt!
- Yeah?
- All of ya!
Come out of that cabin with your hands up, or I shoot Arnie.
- The dirty rat would do it, too.
- George, don't do it!
I'd rather be dead than lose the mine to this scum!
Oh, no!
- Hey, look out for the wagon! Come on!
- Hey, hold it!
Come on, let's get outta here!
- Arnie!
- Sam. You all right?
Sorry I busted up your sluice boxes. Looks like you'll be out of business for a while.
Hell, it's still mine, ain't it?
You'd better get him up to the shack.
- Hiya, Sam!
- Hi.
- Hey, you big ox. Where are you going?
- Oh... nowhere.
- Hey, how is she?
- Who?
Who?! Jenny! I've been going loco.
This last week, I haven't slept a wink.
Hey, Sam. What did she say when she saw the honeymoon cabin?
Well, George, she hasn't exactly seen the cabin.
She hasn't seen it? What did you do?
Leave her in Nome?
- Now, we've been friends for a long time...
- You mean you didn't even bring her?!
- I was gonna tell you a little lie, but...
- You lousy Judas!
- But I couldn't lie to a pal!
- Pal?! Oh, yeah, you're a pal.
- You got drunk and never went to see her!
- I didn't get drunk before, I got drunk after!
Nuts!
Now, you pay attention, George.
I went to see her, honest.
And I saw her, so help me.
Are you listenin'?
- Yeah, I'm listenin'.
- Well, I saw her and her husband.
- Whose husband?
- Jenny's. She's married.
- Married?!
- That's what I've been tryin' to tell ya.
That's why I got drunk. And then
I did a stupid thing, which I regret.
Married!
She couldn't wait.
I'm not even worth waitin' for!
I'm a lousy goose egg laying in an empty honeymoon cabin!
I'll get you a drink.
I got some in the saddlebag.
Leave me alone, Sam.
I don't even want to look at another human being. Leave me alone.
I'll see you back at the cabin.
Billy?
Billy?
Billy, it...
Oh.
Michelle?
- Michelle?
- Oh, no, Billy. Get away. Leave me alone.
Oh! Oh, it's you.
- Am I glad you're back!
- What are you doin' in this bed?
Billy. Little Billy.
That's why I slept in this bed.
He started feeling his wine, and everything else he could get his hands on.
- Well... But about this bed?
- Oh, I know. The honeymoon bed.
- Well, did you tell George about the lie?
- No, I told him the truth.
- And that was a mistake.
- Did you tell him about me?
Not yet, and that's why you'd better get out of this bed.
George is a little sensitive about things right now.
- I'll be in the other cabin when you get ready.
- All right.
Billy!
Billy!
- Michelle!
- Michelle? Ya... dumb little big shot!
- Sam! My head! I'm gonna die!
- You're not that lucky.
- Wait, Sam, please! Listen!
- Well, this'll cure ya!
Sam! No!
- Sam!
- Take deep breaths!
Big drinker?
Big drinker? Well, drink!
Now get outta here and take that wagon down to the sluice boxes and unload it,
- like you shoulda done yesterday!
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Clancy. If only Sam would look at me with your eyes.
But he will. I will make him look at me the way you do.
We gotta get outta here.
George'll be back pretty soon.
Well, I'm almost ready, if you help me button up my blouse.
Why don't you get one of these things that buttons down the front?
Would it be easier for you to button up?
Shut up, you fleabag, unless you want to get dunked in the creek!
Oh, don't be angry, Sam.
You know, you're really very nice.
- Did you ever realise you were?
- All I realise is that we've got to get outta here cos George is coming back.
Well, George is back!
- Oh, hello, George.
- What the hell's going on here?!
- Who is this dame?
- A friend. Angel, this is George Pratt.
- Hello.
- Jenny couldn't make it,
- but this... this tramp could?
- George, let me explain.
I don't wanna hear anything you've got to say, and get off that bed!
- You and your fancy bloomers. Out!
- You lunkhead! If you'd let me explain...
- That perfume! She smells like...
- I got that perfume for Jenny,
- and those fancy bloomers, too!
- But you gave them to her?
You big dumb ox!
I was bringin' her back to you!
I don't wanna listen to any more of... For me?
She's French like Jenny, she's pretty like Jenny, if you ask me, she's prettier.
Do you think that she could make up for my Jenny, take my Jenny's place?!
The idea was to console you, George.
That's the way it started.
- But we've changed our minds.
- That's right.
I'm gonna take her back to the boat, right now! OK, George?
- Well, I don't know.
- He's telling the truth, Mr Pratt.
Get your stuff together and I'll go get the wagon unloaded.
All right, Sam.
Listen. For your information,
I want you to know that... that I slept in this bed, and alone, because of your little brother Billy.
Oh. Well, I'd like this opportunity to explain a few things, Miss...
- What was your name?
- Michelle Bonnet.
You really are French?
Yes. Yes, I'm French,
I'm a fool, and I'm also a tramp.
- Oh, now, look. I apologise...
- No need to apologise, because I am a tramp.
Sam found me in a place called The Hen House, and I guess I'm going back to it.
Well, do you... have to go back?
It doesn't matter. I do the same kind of work wherever I am.
Do you have to?
For whatever reason you begin when you start living this way, it's not very easy to live any other way... and not much chance.
- I don't think it's absolutely necessary...
- Yes, it's necessary.
You see, perfume has a different odour on me.
The pretty things I wear look better on me.
You told me so yourself.
Well, I said I was sorry for what I said before.
Oh, you don't have to be sorry, mon chou.
It was all Sam's and me, and it was our fault.
It was enough for you to lose Jenny.
- Hey, say that again?
- I said you don't need to blame yourself...
No. No, no, no. I mean what you called me.
- You mean mon chou?
- Yeah.
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just a silly French word.
It means "my little cabbage".
- Yeah. Mon chou. Jenny used to call me that.
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
No, no, no. You don't have to be sorry.
You know, it's strange. You remind me of her.
Jenny, I mean.
Well...
I'd better be g...
You know, you've got a lot of things to pack, and...
I sure wish you'd stop being sore at me.
I'd never have done it
- if she hadn't said she wasn't your girl.
- Done what?
- I kissed her hand.
- Oh, shut up!
But Michelle's a wonderful girl, and I sure like her.
I guess I made sort of, well... a beast of myself.
So I heard.
Well, a fella does some crazy things when he's been drinking, doesn't he?
Say, why don't I take her into town, Sam?
Sure. Then you can stay here and make up with George.
Why don't you find the coldest spot in that hot creek and go sit down in it?!
And then change your clothes. Beat it!
I gotta think.
- Where's George?
- He's takin' a bath.
- Takin' a bath?
- He's been soakin' for hours.
I think he's goin' off his rocker.
♪ Oh, Genevieve
♪ My Genevieve
♪ The days may come, the days...
- Hiya, Sam, old partner!
- Well, that's more like it!
- It's good to see you smiling again.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Sam.
- I misunderstood. I couldn't stay mad at you.
- Thanks.
- I saw red for a minute. You know how it is.
- Sure.
Every cloud has a silver lining, Sam, except this one has a pink one, just like those fancy pink bloomers you gave to Michelle?
Well, the wagon's unloaded.
I'll take her on into town.
Oh, there's no need to do that.
You can leave Michelle right here.
- Why?
- Now that we understand each other, just give things a chance to work out.
- Work out? What? Where?
- Here.
- With Angel?
- I like the French name better. Michelle.
- Mon chou Michelle.
- That's pretty.
- Isn't it?
- Bite it off!
- George, you're makin' a mistake.
- You brought her here for me.
I may as well have a go at it. And besides, a man can't pine for a lost love for ever.
But you haven't pined for a lost love for even two hours!
You know, Sam, it's amazing the way she reminds me of Jenny.
Before you make a fool out of yourself,
I'd better explain some things to you.
The Hen House? She told me, Sam.
This girl is square, Sam! She's straight-out!
I like this girl! Oh, Michelle.
Mon chou, mon chou.
- See what I mean? He's goofy.
- I'm not so goofy.
It's been a long, cold winter, and she is like a breath of spring comin' through the window.
It may be true about that Hen House, but Angel isn't like those other girls.
- You can say that again, partner!
- What I'm tryin' to say is, you can't charge her like a bull moose chargin' for his mate!
Thanks for the advice, partner. I'll hold the cards close and play 'em neat, right?
Mon chou, mon chou, mon...
Oh, I love that French!
Mon chou, my...
Now see what you did.
Well, what did I did?
You got poor Michelle so mixed up she don't know what she's doin'.
And now George is in there with my girl!
May I come in?
Of course. I'll be ready in a moment, Mr Pratt.
Hey, let me give you a hand with that?
Oh, it's a handsome bed, and soft.
- She would have loved it, I know.
- Well, I'm glad you like it so much.
- Miss Bonnet?
- Well, I'm... I'm ready.
You don't have to go.
I mean, you could stay here.
Oh, I'm sure there'll be some place in town where I can wait for the ship.
I mean you can stay here... permanent.
- Permanent?
- Permanent.
And be... be your girl?
Oh, yes, ma'am!
No, thank you, Mr Pratt.
No, thank you.
But... that's why you came here, isn't it?
No, I didn't.
Not to be your girl or... anybody's girl ever again.
Not here, or in The Hen House, or anyplace else.
- No?
- No.
Oh.
Well, I'm not one to beg.
- Well, I can see that.
- You can?
Oh. Sam...
ls he gonna give me the horse laugh!
He's gonna open his big mouth and laugh me out of the territory!
Is that all I am, a game for you and Sam?
Oh, no, ma'am! Not for me. No, no, no.
- You're not a game for me.
- But I am a game for Sam.
Well... you know Sam and women.
Yeah... I understand.
Will you please take me into town?
I'd rather not go with Sam.
Sure. It'll kinda save my face, won't it?
- Can we go now?
- Yes, certainly.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute.
Aren't you forgetting these things?
Well... I... I don't want them.
Why not?
Well, they... they're too rich, and too nice, and...
- And Sam gave them to you?
- Oh, shall we go now?
- Wait a minute.
- I'd rather not wait.
You shut up and let me think.
That's it! You're in love with Sam!
- Oh, no! No, I'm not!
- Oh, yes, you are!
You know, I've got a funny notion.
Sam's been acting mighty peculiar.
Tell me, how does he treat you?
Well... nice... as if I were... well, nice.
Did he ever stuff money down the front of you?
No? Did he ever try and smack you?
- No.
- In Seattle, or on the boat,
- did you and Sam...?
- No!
No? Oh, that's not like Sam!
No, indeedy!
You give me those. Now, you sit down there, and we'll stick this out and sort of see what happens.
What are you lookin' at? Stop snoopin'!
I was just wonderin' when they were comin' out to eat.
- Sam, how long they been over there?
- An hour and 28 minutes.
Well, I'm hungry.
Look out, here I come.
He'll hear that. What have you got?
- "Chicka-Chickadee."
- "Chicka-Chick..."?!
We've gotta get something that'll really...
Here it is. Here it is!
- You want somethin' to eat?
- Well, what for?
For your stomach, that's what for!
Turn it over, Sam. The other edge cuts.
Sam! The stove's cold.
Well, if that's the way you feel about it, cook your own food!
- Sam?
- Yes, Billy?
- How do you feel when you're jealous?
- Well, how should I know?
Well, I'm jealous.
Where's that whiskey?
Sam, do you think George is keepin' her over there, you know, against her will?
Oh, sure. You can hear her screamin' for help, can't ya?
- I just don't understand Michelle.
- One thing you gotta learn about women:
They're all liars.
And if they ain't liars, they're worse, layin' for you with wedding music.
Take that little dame from Oregon.
All I was doin' was tyin' her shoelaces, and she starts beatin' me over the head with a preacher!
Or that little thing from Minnesota, who tried to marry me while I was so drunk I didn't know what I was doin'.
If it hadn't been for the parson's mercy,
I'd have been hooked good. For good!
You just can't trust women, no matter how honest they act.
They all wanna be wives.
- Oh, but Michelle, she's...
- Michelle, Michelle!
Chou, cabbage, they're all alike!
- I'm gonna take a bath!
- But you just got cleaned up.
Mind your own business!
Oh, this is gonna kill him!
Oh, poor old Sam.
- Ouch! What are you doin' here?
- What are you doin' here?
- ♪ I love you
- I was lookin' for my soap.
- Let's you and I sing a duet.
- Sing?
One, two, three...
Oh, no, George. It's not going to work.
Sam doesn't care about me. It's that simple.
Oh, come on, now. Don't give up.
Have a little patience, mon chou?
Well, I'm sick and tired of both of 'em.
Come on, Billy.
Let's ignore 'em.
Wait a minute. I got an idea.
I'm gonna do a little reconnoitring.

- No.

You got an upset stomach, maybe?
Sam?
Well, maybe I oughta get you some baking soda.
The time's just about right. Laugh.

- Laugh as loud as you can.
- But... I don't feel like laughing.
- You don't feel...?
- No.
- But he... Oh!
- Are you ticklish?
- No.
Oh, what a marriage she's gonna have!

He'll come back.
Well, what were they doin', Sam?
Oh, shut up!
Sam! The soldiers are comin'.
McCord-Pratt mine? I want to see the owners.
- I'm Sam McCord.
- The district of Nome is under martial law.
Your claim has been cross-filed and will be under guard until the dispute is settled.
There'll be no violence.
Operations will cease immediately.
Well, you've come just in time, soldier boy.
There's no disputes here.
I'm takin' my share and pullin' out!
Hey, Sam!
Two men!
- No, you don't, mister! Put that gold back!
- The hell I will!
- All right, take his gun.
- You can have the mine,
- but a third of this gold...
- All the gold is impounded, to be held until this thing is settled.
But you're under arrest, McCord.
I warned you, no violence.
Sam, everything's gonna be all right.
Just keep your head.
Keep yours, or what's left of it! And keep the mine! And keep her! And keep away from me!
Why, you pig-headed baboon!
Wait. I have something to say to my partner.
You're a knucklehead!
Now, won't you listen to somebody about something?
Save your breath! You've been ajinx to me ever since I met you!
I've had it! Get me outta here!
Jail me!
Michelle?
Excuse me. When are you going back to town?
Just as soon as we load up with whatever's being impounded.
- Could you take me along?
- Why, sure, ma'am. Be glad to.
- Thank you. I'll be right back.
- Yes, ma'am.
Mr McCord witnessed the weighing of his gold, but he won't sign the receipts.
I'm not signing anything.
The hell with the hearing.
Let George Pratt fight for the mine.
All I want is my share and to get outta here.
Take off your hat, Mr McCord.
Mr Commissioner, my name's Duggan.
I'll sign my copy, sir.
Is this the fella that cross-filed on me?
He jumped Arnie's mine.
- You're a lousy...!
- That's enough, Mr McCord. That's enough!
Mr Duggan has no lien on your property.
He's only here to represent a Mr... Peter Boggs.
Peter Boggs? Who's he?
He's the trapper that built the cabin on the site of your mine. He cross-filed.
Let me talk to him.
Why didn't he show up himself?
That won't be necessary, so long as
Mr Duggan is here to represent him.
- Am I through, Mr Commissioner?
- Yes.
You'll be notified about the hearing.
Thank you, sir.
- When is this hearing?
- In about two months.
Two months?!
If you're interested in your share, you'll sign here.
I'll sign.
Let this office get about its business. Yours is not the only case we have to settle here.
I'm gonna help you settle mine.
Just a minute!
You forgot something.
Next case!
Porter! Get the lady's bags out of the back and take them inside, please.
Mister? Is that the Seattle boat?
- Yes, ma'am.
- But it's back early.
Yes, ma'am. She had to turn back from Kotzebue on account of the ice.
- Good luck, ma'am.
- Well, thank you.
Michelle. Michelle!
- Oh, Billy!
- Come here.
I wanna talk to you. Come here.
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you, Michelle. I...
Listen, I've caused enough trouble.
Please go away.
You haven't caused any trouble.
It was Sam and George!
I can't get my share of the gold right away, but...
I'll find a way to take care of ya.
I can get ajob.
Billy... you are a nice boy.
- Aw, it's no fair sayin' that.
- And I was almost a nice girl.
Now, please go back to the mine.
Everything is gonna be all right.
Please.
Well, Miss Bonnet.
You didn't leave us for long.
No. I'm taking the boat back to Seattle.
- Do you know when I can go aboard?
- Passengers can't load till midnight, ma'am.
Well, do you mind if I wait here until I...?
That won't be necessary. Mr Canon expected you. He kept your suite.
- Expected me?
- Yes. I'll show you to your room. This way.
Please?
Won't be a minute, sir.
Neither will I.
- What the...?
- Where's Pete Boggs?
- Let me go!
- Boggs. Where is he?
- I don't know!
- Maybe this'll refresh your memory.
- Boggs.
- I don't know!
- Boggs.
- I don't know!
- Boggs!
- He's the porter!
He's the porter at Frankie Canon's casino!
Take over.
I'm sorry, mister.
Accidents will happen.
Who is it?
Welcome back, Angel.
I'm sorry, Frankie. Please go away.
I know how you feel. It isn't every day a girl loses a gold mine.
- May I come in?
- It's your hotel.
- You look unhappy.
- I have a headache.
That's a natural reaction from pickin' a loser.
We all make mistakes. Look,
I didn't come to talk personalities.
Just business. Are we partners?
No. I'm taking the boat back to Seattle tonight.
I don't get it. Back to where? The Hen House?
Just because Sam McCord's a bum and you lost a gold mine, you don't have to leave Alaska.
You've got brains.
- You can have me, and money too.
- I don't want your money.
- Just me.
- No.
I don't want you either.
- That's... that's madness.
- Could be.
You see, I'm running out of Alaska for the same reason I came.
Because I'm stupid.
Because I want to go on kidding myself that I am... different.
That's all.
Now, please go, and leave me alone.
Yeah, well, you're just tired and upset.
This is no time to decide anything.
Maybe we'll have dinner.
It's a better time to talk.
Sure. I'll pick you up at eight o'clock.
And... look real pretty.
Eight o'clock.
- Frankie?
- Well, that was a quick decision.
How long have you been holding this room for me?
Since the day before yesterday, Angel.
How did you know two days ago that Sam was broke?
I heard a rumour around town that the mine was impounded.
- Was it?
- Yes.
Well, you know I'd be lying if I said I was sorry.
I'll see you at eight.
Mister? Where's the porter?
- I asked you where's the porter?
- Out back there, of course.
- Where'd you expect to find him?
- Thank you.
Glad to meet you, Bog...
- Billy!
- I haven't got her, Sam, honest.
- What are you doing here?
- Cleaning the gaboons. I'm the new janitor.
- Where's the old one? Boggs.
- I don't know. They told me he struck it rich.
Yeah, well, he did strike it rich.
He's the one that cross-filed on us.
Frankie oughta know where he is.
Sam, wait for me! I'm still a partner.
- Do you know which room is Frankie's?
- It's up and around, and the suite in front.
Who's there? Who is it?
- That... that... that sounds like...
- Yeah!
Sorry to intrude in this fashion.
- Well, I have nothing to say to you.
- Or me.
I'm here on a louse hunt.
Come on out, Frankie.
Gosh, Michelle. I didn't think you'd be here.
Well, what did you think, kid?
That she'd leave us and join the Salvation Army?
Let's go find dear Frankie.
Listen to me! Listen to this.
And it's not for you. It's for Billy and George.
Frankie knew the mine would be impounded
- even before the soldiers started up there.
- What?! How?
Well, you're so smart, figure it out for yourself.
Now, go on and leave me alone.
Well, don'tjust stand there. Go find Frankie.
- Me?
- Beat it!
I wanna thank you very kindly for the information.
And then I wanna tell you you're the worst double-crosser I ever met!
- First you double-cross me...
- You? I double-crossed you?
Me, with George. And now you're double-crossing your boyfriend Frankie!
You're wrong about everything!
Not once since I've met you have you been right about anything at all!
Yup. That's my boy Sam, all right.
Oh! You!
Well, here she is. I found her for you - your nice, square, straight-out girl.
- In business again, as usual.
- She's not my girl. I wish she was.
- She's yours!
- Oh, no, I'm not!
Listen. We were putting it on for you.
- No, we were not!
- Of course we were!
He won't believe you.
He'd rather believe me!
I wouldn't believe you on a stack of Bibles!
No matter what else he is, George is not a liar.
If he says he's putting it on, he's...
Wait a minute! You are a liar,
- or why else are you here?
- I'm looking for a fella named Boggs!
Take it easy, Sam.
Timber!
- Take it easy.
- Sam, I can't find Frankie, but Boggs is here, locked up in a room.
- What room?
- I don't know.
Well, this is as good as any place to start.
Hey! What is this?
Take it easy.
Billy! Is he in here?
No.
Don't give up, kid. This is promising.
- Billy!
- Oh, I can take care of myself.
Gentlemen! What a pleasant surprise!
- That's him!
- You're just in time to have a drink.
- We want to have a little talk with you.
- Oh, that's good.

Cross-filed? I did?

Didn't Frankie Canon ask you to do something for him?
Frankie? No!
He's the nicest guy I ever met.
He gave me this whole room and all this whiskey, for nothin'!
- All I did was put an X on a piece of paper.
- You signed something? What did it say?
I don't know. If I could read,
I wouldn't have to sign with an X, right?

A Ranger.
Now we get a Ranger.
Let's whup him.
[Muttering]
What's the matter with you two fellas?
Tar and feather him as a lesson.
Yeah, tar and feather him.
You with us?
Come on!
[Clamoring]
Come on.
Someone mind telling me what happened?
Jim Flood happened.
Flood figured he was getting cheated at poker by Ike Hanley.
He shot Hanley then shot his brothers.
That's when we needed us a Ranger.
One finally comes along, he ain't even got brains enough to be wearing a gun.
- [Man]
Take it easy, Beeker.
- Take it easy?
After Flood burns my place down and shoots four men?
Without a lawman, this town depends on the Rangers.
Ain't never one around when you need 'em.
[Saloon Girl]
Hey, the fire's starting up again.
- Hey, get those water buckets, men!
- Form a line, men!
[Clamoring]
Mind telling me how I get to the town of Buckley?
It's about 30 mile due north.
Which way did this Flood go?
Out that way. Northwest.
But I wouldn't go chasing after him all by my lonesome.
I'm obliged.
Better get out of this town, though, before they decide to hang me.
I guess you fellas are Company "D."
That's right.
Captain Bledsoe sent me up from Austin.
I'm supposed to go to work for you.
You Lieutenant Herly?
Mm-hmm. What's your name?
Jones, sir. Seven Jones.
You any kin to Two Jones?
Yes, sir.
He was my brother.
You knew him?
I knew him.
You remember Jones,
Lieutenant.
I remember, Sergeant.
I'd have been here earlier, but I've been chasing a fella by the name of Jim Flood.
You were chasing Flood?
Well, not exactly chasing him.
Mostly just trying to see which way he went.
He sort of wrecked a place called Beeker's Crossing.
What happened?
He burned down the saloon, shot up the place.
I couldn't pick up his trail.
He's got a long start.
Hennessey, you'll go after Flood in the morning. I'll figure out which men you can take.
You're not going?
No, I've got too much work to do here.
You take care of Jones.
Get him settled.
How long you been a Ranger?
Just since they signed me up at Austin.
Don't you believe in sidearms?
They said you'd issue me a revolving gun.
Mm. What about
Clancy's old gun?
It'll be deducted from your first month's pay.
Well, it sure is a honey.
Well, it's a gun, not a baby, Seven.
Yes, sir.
And you don't call sergeants "sir."
You know how to shoot it?
Sort of.
Is there someplace where I could try it out?
About 10,000 square miles of nothing out back a ways.
Come on.
Take a shot at that gong out there.
[Loud Clang]
That's doing it the hard way.
You some kind of trick shot or something?
No.
Try the rest of your shot.
Only safe place in the whole valley was that gong.
I'll show you your bunk and where you can put your horse.
Soon as you tend to your horse, maybe Mrs. Karrington will give you some dinner, if she's got any left.
Mrs. Karrington?
Yeah, that's her house over there.
She's got the deal to feed us Rangers.
I could sure use something to eat.
Put your horse in the first stall there.
Thank you.
I just got a glimpse of him when he went by the house.
Hmm?
I'll bet he's real nice.
Mm-hmm.
Ma?
Hmm?
Do you think...
Do you think the average person would like me in this dress?
Mm-hmm.
[Jones
Clears Throat]
They told me I might be able to get something to eat.
The noon meal's already over.
Who sent you?
That lieutenant?
No, ma'am.
Sergeant Hennessey.
Oh. Well, clear a place for yourself at the table.
There's some dishes in the kitchen and beans in the pot.
[Young Woman]
It's the door over there.
Hold still.
[Tableware Breaking]
A cup.
We got plenty of cups.
And two plates.
Well, I think that looks all right.
I think it's beautiful.
[Barks, Pants]
[Whines]
Did you find the beans all right?
Uh-huh.
You didn't get any coffee.
I'll get it for him, Ma.
There you are.
Uh, Mr...
Jones.
Seven Jones.
I'm Joy Karrington.
Ma, his name is Seven Jones.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.
Sit down.
Go ahead and eat.
I'll get the hot water started, and you bring the rest of the dishes, will you, dear?
That's a nice dog.
His name's Apache.
Apache?
Well, it's no funnier name than you've got.
No, I... I guess not.
Just wait till you've heard the rest of it.
You see, my pa wasn't much for fancy when it came to giving out names, so he just named us by the numbers and let it go at that.
Plain number's not much of a name.
That's what my ma said, too, so we always used to add something like, uh, the firstborn was
One for the Money Jones, the second was
Two for the Show Jones, and right on up to me.
My full name is
Seven Ways from Sundown Jones.
[Chuckles]
Well.
You're new on the Rangers.
Yes, ma'am.
How'd you come to join?
Well, mostly it was on account of my older brother, Two Jones.
He got killed working for the Rangers.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That, uh... That was a real pretty dress you were trying on.
It's for the Fultons' barn raising tonight.
Are you going?
Well, I don't know.
I haven't been asked.
Well, the Fultons will be real glad to have you.
Well, maybe.
Oh, I'll get you some pie.
We ain't that hard up for men, Herly.
That's for me to say, Sergeant.
You know as well as me what kind of man Flood is.
I ought to be taking a whole company instead of one new man.
Jones has got to pull his own weight.
You saw how he handled a gun.
Me and him taking on Jim Flood would be downright suicide!
You're taking Jones,
Sergeant, and that's that.
Hennessey.
You don't think I like making that choice, do you?
But I got men scattered over half of Texas.
I need at least five men down in the south plateau, four men covering the Baker place, and I can't send
Duncan or Hollis.
Most of those men are protecting cows.
Is saving a few head of cattle more important than a man's life?
He joined up, didn't he?
Let him earn his pay.
He don't seem to know
Flood was in on the killing of his brother, but finding out might make him act even more foolish than normal.
I'd say he'd be the last man to send.
Stay, Apache.
You stay here, boy.
Stay.
[Barking]
- [Screeches]
- [Barks]
[Screeches]
- [Joy] Apache!
- [Barking]
[Screeching]
Apache. There.
[Whimpers]
There's a good dog.
It's all right.
There. There now.
Well, just maybe he might not be the last man to send.
How come you can't handle a six-shooter?
Us Joneses never had too much spare cash.
I never could afford one of them revolving guns.
When word gets back in the morning about Flood, you and me's gonna take out after him.
Good.
Say, uh, your brother ever mention anything about working for Herly?
No. Two wasn't much for writing.
I'm glad I'm going with you, Sergeant.
Well, maybe along the way
I can teach you about using a sidearm.
I'd be obliged to you.
[Chattering]
Jones?
You're staying here tonight.
Keep an eye on the office.
Yes, sir.
The first barn raising
I've been to in a year.
Lots of girls and lots of whiskey.
Both are fun and both are risky.
[Laughing]
Hey! Wait for me!
[Ranger #1]
Come on, Shorty. We can't keep the women waiting.
[Ranger #2]
Yeah, all the good-looking ones will be picked.
[Ranger #3]
You sure smell pretty,
Shorty.
[Ranger #4] Yeah, he smells like he climbed out of a jug of that fancy flowery water.
[Rangers Chattering]
Let 'em rip!
[Ranger #4]
Come on! A gal in one hand and a jug in the other!
Maybe I should take the duty, Seven.
Wouldn't want you half asleep when we take off.
I'm all right.
Hennessey.
Yeah?
You said you knew my brother.
How'd he come to get killed?
Well, I don't know much about it.
Some fracas down in the Big Bend country.
Yeah, I know that.
If you should get sleepy,
I'll take over.
Thanks.
[Knocking]
Oh, hello.
Hello.
You wanna sit down?
I thought you went to the barn raising.
Oh, oh, we-we did, but, uh...
Well, Ma wasn't feeling so well, so we, uh...
We left early.
Oh.
That's too bad.
They said it was you and Hennessey going out after Jim Flood.
That's right.
Sergeant Hennessey and me.
Fr-From the stories
I've heard about him,
Flood must be 20 feet tall.
Don't you worry about that.
Well...
[Sighs]
It's just that, uh, well, Ma and me, we, uh... we wouldn't want to have anything bad happen to Sergeant Hennessey...
But why should it be you going with him?
Why not?
I'm a Ranger.
Yes, but you're so new.
Yes, I am, but the sergeant's gonna teach me as we go along.
Maybe he'll be able to keep me from getting killed for the first day or two.
Well, it's just...
Well, Ma sure thinks an awful lot of you, the way you saved the pup today and all and...
Well, she liked you right away... from the first time she saw you.
Yeah, well,
I sure like her too.
She's nice, all right.
Look, uh, it isn't as if it's gonna be my last night on earth.
I wish you good luck.
Well, report is Flood's still heading north.
Likely pick up his trail around Sterling City.
That far up?
He sure gets a lot of distance out of a horse.
Doing the impossible's just everyday living for Flood.
I'll check us out.
Be right back.
Oh. Fine morning,
Miss Joy.
Yes, sure is fine.
How's your ma this morning?
Oh, she's much improved today. Thank you.
She was, uh, saying how it's... too bad we didn't get to know you longer than just one day.
Well, I...
I'd sure like to be able to write you a letter sometime, if I'm gone that long.
You think it'd be all right?
Oh, I'd like that.
So would Ma.
Oh, uh, I brought you a little food to take along.
It's always nice to have a little extra food.
Oh, it's a cake.
Oh.
It's a real beautiful cake.
It's about the nicest thing anyone ever did for me.
You take good care of yourself, Seven.
I'll come back to see you.
Morning, Joy.
Cake.
Hey.
[Gunshot]
That's two times out of four... you hit good and close today.
You're getting the hang of it.
Doesn't look like we're ever gonna catch up with Flood.
Should pull into Sterling late today.
Knowing Flood, you figure he'll still be there?
Knowing Jim?
The only thing a man can know about what
Jim's gonna do... is that he'll darn sure never know.
Kind of full of surprises, huh?
Yeah.
Nothing, huh?
Nope.
** [Piano]
Any other suggestions?
Yeah.
Let's have a drink.
[People Chattering]
** [Continues]
Hello, boys.
Evening, miss.
Uh, Lucinda.
How 'bout a drink?
Couple of whiskeys.
And get whatever you'd like for yourself.
Thank you.
Joe? Two whiskeys.
Bet this is the only town in Texas where nobody ever heard of Jim Flood.
They've heard of him, all right.
He's been here and gone.
Left 'em all dizzy with his blasted charm.
There's not many places left to look for him around here.
What do you boys do?
A little of everything.
Well, I heard you're looking for Jim Flood.
Might be.
What do you want with him?
That ain't anybody's business but Jim's and ours.
A man like that has a lot of enemies.
Jim can take care of his enemies.
[Lucinda]
That's true.
You're, uh, not the law.
Do I look it?
You don't.
He does, kinda.
'Cept'n he's young.
His honest looks come in handy sometimes.
If you're still doubtful,
I don't suppose a lawman would know the particular place...
Flood has a burn scar shaped like an "X."
Yeah, well, um, how do you know about that?
It was me accidentally branded him one time...
One time when we was drunk.
Oh.
If, um...
If I do tell you where he went, will you give him a message for me?
Fair enough.
He left day before yesterday.
He's headed north towards Big Spring.
Will you tell him that...
That Lucinda loves him and-and to please come back?
Or to let me know where he is so I can go to him.
We'll tell him.
I sure wish the best for you, ma'am.
Oh, no, the...
The drinks are on the house.
Well, thank you.
You won't forget?
Not a chance.
We're not headed north.
Nope.
How come?
Flood didn't go south
'cause we come up that way.
He didn't go east
'cause there's nothing out there.
That pretty much leaves west, the way we're traveling, out toward the Llano Estacado.
What about north, like the girl said?
Flood never in his life told a girl... the right direction he was going.
You really think we can make money off the lake, Mr. Flood?
Sure. After we stock it with sturgeon, we can make a million dollars selling caviar.
What's that?
Well, it's a fancy food.
The crowned heads of Europe swear by it.
"Crowned heads"?
You know, kings and queens, lords and ladies.
Czars and czarinas.
Them people sure must have a great time of it, mister.
[Laughs] Most of them would like to change places with us right now.
They would?
You betcha.
Taking life easy is one of the delights of the world.
Guess so.
Gee, that sure is a mighty pretty folding knife.
You like the idea of us stocking the lake with sturgeons?
Sure do. I'd like to go partners with you anytime.
Well, just maybe we'll do her one of these days.
I've been living right over there in part of this canyon my whole life, and nobody ever had that idea before.
They're just farmers.
Well, farming's fine if you like it.
Me, I'd rather do something
I like and go bust... than succeed at doing something dull.
Yeah. Makes you feel like, uh...
That life has a kind of magic in it.
Yeah.
Say, would you, um, take another look at the flats behind us there?
Sure.
Still don't see nothin'.
Out toward the peaks, way back. Look high.
Yeah. There's a speck of dust way out there.
Hmm. People sure can be a nuisance sometimes.
You in a spot?
What, me?
They're gonna be in trouble if they don't quit following me.
You might tell 'em that.
All right.
I'll sure tell 'em.
On stocking the lake.
We just might do her one of these days.
- Mr. Flood?
- Yeah?
You forgot your folding knife.
That's much too nice a knife for a fellow like me to be careless with it.
You better take care of it for me.
Gee, thanks.
So long, Jody.
Good-bye, Mr. Flood.
Seven!
Flood?
No doubt about it.
Smoked these ever since he was a kid.
'Bout a day ahead,
I'd say.
You seem to know him real good.
Nobody knows Jim Flood real good. [Grunts]
But when we was young fellas, we did spend some time together.
That so?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He could always beat us others at anything...
Cards, women, guns.
Never even seemed to try hard.
How come he wound up an outlaw?
Well, some people say he just never grew up.
To him, this world was kind of a circus... and Fourth of July celebration all rolled into one.
That's why he was trouble, people say.
And it's also why they usually loved him... at first sight.
You seem to think a fair amount of him too.
Yeah, in a way.
When you see the kind of a fella he is, you gotta forgive him a lot of things.
It's not for us to judge him one way or the other.
Now I want you to remember that.
I'll remember.
One thing I know for sure about him.
Yeah?
He seems to just loaf along... and rides about a thousand miles a day.
Sooner or later, we'll come up with him.
Hey.
[Gunshot]
You see a stranger around here lately?
Not for six or eight months.
You been making these horse tracks and munching that grass there yourself?
[Blade Scraping]
He said for you not to follow him no more.
Don't suppose you know which way he went.
Didn't rightly notice, mister.
See what I mean about Flood?
[Gunshot]
Stay down.
Oh.
I should've known.
It was going too easy.
Hennessey.
Remember what I told ya.
It ain't up to us to judge Flood.
I'm giving you an order.
You head right back for Texas.
Promise me you won't go after him yourself.
I'm not going anywhere by myself.
You're gonna be all right.
Promise me.
You sure are stubborn.
[Gunshot]
[Neighing]
Where's my hat?
You one of those two fellas been trailing me?
That's right.
If you're gonna shoot,
I'd wish you'd get it over with.
The suspense is awful.
Hold it.
That's the last one.
You want it?
You're a pretty good shot.
It's a pretty bad hole.
Doesn't look too bad to me.
Oh?
What are our plans now?
I'm taking you back to Texas.
I imagine they'll hang you.
Oh.
In the meantime, would you be good enough to toss me my hat?
Get it yourself.
Looks like you'll have to carry me all the way to Texas.
That won't stop me.
Can't get far.
I tell ya,
I'm bleeding to death.
All right.
We'll stay right here till that bleeding stops.
Sit down.
There's a better place close by.
Where?
Cabin of mine.
Let's go.
[Groans]
Well, after all,
I did get shot.
That cabin of mine is just a short way up ahead.
I'm telling you this because I'm just about to pass out.
You pass out and I'll let you lay here and die.
This is kind of embarrassing.
I got any blood left?
I don't know.
You cutting me open to see?
I've got to probe for that bullet.
Way you look right now, you're more likely to stab me to death.
Why don't you shut up.
[Grunts]
[Grunts]
[Gasps]
[Grunts]
[Bullet Clatters In Pan]
That was... real nice of you not to leave me out there to die after all.
Well, I should have after what you did to Hennessey.
Hennessey?
Sergeant Hennessey,
Texas Rangers.
Man you shot back there.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
Who cares how you feel?
What's your name?
Jones.
Jones... you're a nice, likable young fella.
You look real close, you'll see a small scar... right at the top of my forehead.
Comanche put it there when he started to scalp me...
15 years ago.
It was Hennessey who stopped him.
Now let's not bring Hennessey up again.
[Flood Groans]
Still here.
Mm-hmm.
Couple pieces of beef, and I'll feel good as new.
How 'bout you?
I'm fine.
There's food aplenty out there in the pantry.
I found it.
Oh.
There's a lean-to out back for the horses.
Feed's out there too.
I found it.
I found that too.
[Chuckles]
That's the only piece of artillery in the place.
If you'd asked me where it was,
I'd have told you.
I'll bet.
Well, I might as well get a fire started.
I'll go feed the horses.
You know how to cook?
All the chefs in New Orleans slink away in shame... when my name is mentioned.
Yeah.
Steak and beans for supper.
Well.
Now, this six-gun has what you might call a hair trigger.
Don't put that fork down too heavy.
It might go off.
[Chuckles]
They're sure teaching you young Rangers to be cautious nowadays.
Let me have your plate.
I noticed some rat poison in the pantry.
Jones!
Your cutting knife.
[Chuckling]
Is it all right if we eat now?
Yeah.
You're an incessant talker, aren't you?
I talk when there's something to say.
Tell me something.
Why did they send an inexperienced young fella like you after me?
It's kind of insulting.
Nothing personal, of course.
I've got you, haven't I?
Well, in a way, yes.
But the only reason I haven't killed you is because you're a friend of Hennessey's, and you're a likable young fellow.
There's some pickles in the pantry.
I'll get them.
Think pretty high of yourself, don't you?
Kill me. Ha.
You see what I mean?
When you were watching me through the window there, you didn't watch long enough.
Well, from now on,
I'll be more careful.
[Clatters]
I should hope so.
[Chuckling]
You a gambling man?
Sometimes.
Want to play a little stud or draw?
I've got a hunch you ain't honest.
Well.
Let's just say
I'm not easy to beat.
[Cards Shuffling]
- What should we play for?
- Fun?
All right. Money.
Pennies.
[Chuckles]
You sure are a plunger.
Look, I only make
$26 a month.
I'll get some beans.
Each bean will be worth one penny.
[Chuckles]
Well, I guess it's better than playing solitaire.
[Laughing]
Call.
Jacks.
Three of them.
Beats two pair.
How much is that altogether?
Let's see.
Now, that makes, uh, $62.
Better than two months' wages gone in one night.
You're gonna have to wait a while to get paid.
Thing to do is try to win it back.
No. We're leaving here first thing in the morning.
It's time to get some sleep.
You figured out how to do that?
Yeah. You're sleeping in the pantry.
There's room on the floor.
Hmm.
I suspected as much.
Night.
- Say, Flood.
- Yeah?
I've been thinking about you not hitting me with that poker.
You miss me on purpose?
That's a stupid question,
Jones.
Yeah, well, the thing is,
I, uh... Well...
You trying to thank me, kid?
No, I'm not.
Don't call me "kid" either.
My name's Seven.
What?
Seven Ways from Sundown Jones.
Oh.
Well, we all have a cross to bear.
Night.
I wish you weren't so set on going all the way back to Texas.
I kind of like it here.
Well, that's where we're goin'.
You're an easy cuss to get along with.
I sort of hate to hurt you, so I'll go along a ways.
But I'm not going to jail in Buckley.
Let's make that clear, hmm?
I'll take two.
Twenty cents.
I'll call it.
Three jacks.
Straight.
You sure you're not cheating?
All right.
I'm gonna teach you something, Seven.
See the back of that card?
You using a marked deck?
I still don't feel like going back to Texas.
Just the same, come daylight, you better be ready to ride.
Can't beat you young fellas for optimism.
Seems to me I oughta have a strong vote in what we do just now.
Hennessey said you was full of tricks.
Yeah.
So I took the trouble to unload that six-gun.
[Clicks]
[Chuckling]
You know, I'm beginning to think that you and me oughta be partners.
Game's over.
Yeah.
You, uh, owe me $86.
Turn around.
I'm gonna tie you up.
Fine.
Lie down.
Thought maybe
I busted your head.
[Chuckles]
Speaking of heads, you got the hardest one
I ever saw.
Last fellow
I walloped like that was out for three hours.
I was out long enough.
You could have shot me.
This rope is kinda tight.
How long you figurin' on keeping me tied up?
All the way back to Texas.
You sure you wouldn't rather go to California instead of Texas?
Texas.
The least you can do is let me choose my route.
There's a couple of girls
I'd kind of like to see along the way.
This is not exactly a sightseeing trip.
It's a long way.
Least we can do is enjoy it.
Say, Seven, I don't know whether you know it or not, but I think we might be in a little trouble.
What kind of trouble?
Apaches, I suspect.
We've been traveling on some of their sacred ground.
I know it might seem foolish from your point of view, but I'd suggest that you untie me and give me my gun.
If they are Apaches, you're still gonna stay tied.
I'd suggest strongly that you give me something to shoot with.
You got any other suggestions?
Yeah. Come on.
We got some other visitors over here.
How are you gonna fight 'em off from both sides at once?
I don't know, but it's a lot better than having to fight you too.
I thought Indians always did a lot of hollering.
They do that mainly when they're trying to build up their nerve.
They don't think they got any particular problem here.
You keep watching that side.
[Gunfire]
[Horse Whinnies]
Uh-oh. Looks like they're plannin' on joining the merriment.
Well, we're not waiting for that.
Get on your horse.
I'd argue with you, only it's better than waiting around here all day.
[Gunshot]
[Gunfire]
Of all the lousy, rotten luck...
A single shot.
Where'd you get that rifle?
[Flood Laughs]
Look at them run.
I guess they decided to do something easy like attack an army fort... rather than tangle with you and me.
You know, if you had untied my hands, they might have thought they were surrounded.
[Chuckles]
Let's get out of here.
Cigar?
No, thanks.
You know, I think if I had to face life without cigars, whiskey, women, steak and cards,
I'd much rather they take me out, string me up.
There's an unpleasant thought... getting hung.
The word is "hanged."
Which is what ain't gonna happen to me.
I've been shot 11 times, broke out of more jails than you can count, had a rope around my neck twice, so... don't worry about me.
I won't.
I'm still trying to figure out how they sent just you and Hennessey after me.
Your boss got something against you?
Heck no.
Herly's just short of men.
Herly?
That's just like the Rangers.
They're always short of something...
Men, money or brains.
You know, Jones, you could have a lot more fun if you'd quit the Rangers, join up with me.
I've got a kind of calling.
One of my brothers was killed with the Rangers.
Oh.
That's a darn shame.
Last spring, down the Big Bend country.
Last spring?
Yep. April.
Your brother, he, uh...
He look anything like you?
I guess so.
Taller maybe.
I kind of liked old Two.
Seems to me I heard something about that scrap.
Way I heard it, that Ranger wouldn't have gotten shot... if another Ranger hadn't ducked out on him.
How do you mean?
Well, the way I heard it, another lawman... was supposed to be covering for him, but he hid behind a rock, never showed himself.
Seems to me it was the Ranger's fault.
What else do you know about it?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Just picked that story up in El Paso.
In any case, I sure am sorry about your brother.
I'm gonna get some sleep.
[Flood]
Well, what'll it be,
Sterling or Hobbs?
I don't want to go into a town where there'll be a lot of fuss.
Just want to pick up some supplies and wire the Rangers.
Then my suggestion would be to head on over towards Sterling.
I thought it would be.
I met your girl Lucinda the other day.
Everyone in town kinda likes you.
Well, I guess it'll have to be Hobbs then.
You think we can get our supplies without a mob coming out to lynch you?
We might even stop off for a quiet drink or two.
Now that you've wired the Rangers, and before we go shopping, you suppose we could have that quiet drink?
[Men Chattering]
I guess one drink wouldn't hurt.
Ah, howdy, Jim.
[Shouting Greetings]
- Look who's here.
- [Chattering]
And it was your suggestion we go to Sterling, huh?
It was your decision to come to Hobbs, Jones.
Say, how in blazes did you get tied up?
Well, let's untie him.
Hold it!
Jim!
Who tied you up?
Meet Seven Jones, Gilda.
Maybe we oughta drop this Jones down a well.
Oh, no, no, Sam.
Don't tangle with him.
He's tougher than he looks.
We ain't gonna let him take you away. Right?
[Crowd]
Right!
Whoa now, everybody!
We don't want to get each other banged up.
I'm sure Mr. Jones wouldn't mind if we all had a sociable drink.
You give me your word you won't try to get away?
You think my word's any good?
Yeah, I do.
You got it.
All right.
You sure are a trusting soul.
[Bartender] First drinks are on the house!
Come on, boys.
Sit down here, Jim.
Make yourself at home, Jones.
You're among friends.
There you are, Jim.
Ah, the good stuff.
Good boy.
Well, fill us in on what you been doing, Jim.
Well, staying sober mostly.
Keepin' out of trouble.
What do we drink to?
Let's drink to Seven Jones.
The only man I ever hit who didn't stay down.
To Seven Jones.
If Seven here would be willin' to turn his back long enough for us to cut those ropes, between all of us here, we'd give him enough money to retire.
What I've been wondering,
Flood, is what is it you ever did for this town.
[Chuckling]
He's just him, that's all.
Town comes to life when he's here.
You know, he's... he's what every man would like to be but never is.
Nobody will ever tame him.
What's more, he's never gone on a rampage in this town, which is, uh, sort of a help.
** [Piano Stops]
How are you, Jim?
Maybe you ladies would like to rejoin us later, hmm?
Sure.
You fellas got something on your mind?
Word come that Flood was here.
Flood is worth $6,000, dead or alive.
Word also came that he was tied up.
Or you two bounty hunters would be runnin' like rabbits.
Pay no heed, Dick.
You're a Texas Ranger, young fella, on New Mexico soil.
You know the law?
No.
But he upholds it anyhow.
We got us duly constituted authority here. You ain't.
You gotta turn him over to us.
We'll guarantee he won't get away.
I don't like your looks, mister.
Sorry.
Maybe we'll have to shoot you too, kid.
Of course, we'd be willing to make a deal about the reward money.
That's about far enough.
I got a gun aimed right at your belt buckle.
He's bluffin'.
I reckon.
He's defendin' Flood, which means he's goin' against the law.
Get him!
Put it on the bar.
Now finish that quiet drink of yours.
Why don't you just shoot him and let's get on with the party?
Let's get out of here.
You got any idea about following us, forget it.
I'll untie Flood and give him a gun.
That was an interesting break in the monotony last night.
If you only had the sense to take my advice, we'd still be there.
Little girl who kept eyeing you was kinda pretty.
There's one I like better back in Buckley.
No reason not to like 'em all.
Maybe if I get to stay in Buckley long enough,
I'll meet her.
See if I approve.
You'll have plenty of time.
Nope. You keep forgettin'.
I said
I'm not going to jail.
You know, we never did get those supplies.
All we need is some meat and flour and some horseshoe nails.
We can make do.
What about cigars?
Well, there's a tragedy
I can't even stand thinkin' about.
Problem is, we're headed toward the Pecos country over towards Devil's River.
Not many towns there
I'm on friendly terms with.
I'm glad to hear that.
[Laughs]
You know, Jonesy, you looked brave as a lion, holding off them bounty hunters.
Maybe we can get the supplies we need from them.
I'd give my right arm for a cigar.
Ho.
Ho.
- [Jones] Afternoon.
- What do you want?
We need some supplies, if you'd let us have 'em.
Like what?
Hey, that's Jim Flood!
Sure it is.
I seen him in El Paso.
I'm taking him in.
We don't want any trouble, just some supplies.
That's the man
Jake Hanley and his bunch was lookin' for, and he'll pay plenty to lay his hands on him.
I said
I'm takin' him in.
Sure, son.
Hanley'd pay half a year's wages for him.
And he's tied up.
Shut up.
This man's the law, and we ain't going against the law.
Now that we've got that settled, what we need is flour and beans... and horseshoe nails if you could spare them.
Get him some, Joe.
[Whinnying]
- [Gunshot]
- Hah! Hah!
Get out of here!
Hah! Hah!
Hey, look at this!
Seven, when I pass on to glory, my one wish will be to go with a pocket full of cigars.
Where I'm going, there'll be no problem lighting them.
Hey.
Who is that Jake Hanley they were talking about?
Hanley?
Him and his friends are undoubtedly the meanest bunch of gunslingers... in the entire Southwest.
And you, a Ranger, never heard of him?
What's he got against you?
All sorts of things too numerous to mention.
Had a dispute with some of his brothers one time, for instance.
They the same Hanleys you shot back at Beeker's Crossing?
Yeah.
No wonder he's out to get you.
They're just one, big, mean family, and Jake's the last of 'em.
We may as well help ourselves to the stuff we need.
That's the way
I like to hear you talk.
You'd make a fair-to-middlin' badman if you ever gave yourself half the chance.
Do you, um, ever think about it?
About what?
Bein' an outlaw.
Havin' the sheer pleasure of throwin' in with me.
Together we could pick up the entire Southwest and shake it like a pair of dice, come up with a lucky seven every time.
Nope. Never thought about it.
Well, think about it.
Ah.
Hey, look at this.
Some bacon.
Those peaks are startin' to look familiar.
We oughta be in Buckley about tomorrow night, I'd say.
If we make it to Buckley.
Huh?
Look, Seven, if we run into that Hanley bunch, don't try too hard to hold on to me.
[Horse Whinnies]
Hanley?
Yeah.
Let him take me,
Seven.
Uh-uh.
No use of us both gettin' killed.
Get out of the way.
I'm not standing by and let you get shot.
You're my prisoner.
Don't do it.
Let's not have a big fracas.
I'll just go along with you fellows.
Good.
Nobody's taking him,
Hanley.
Better get out of here, kid.
[Whinnying]
Hey, Jonesy.
Thanks.
[Flood]
Buckley, hmm?
Yep.
You made it, Seven.
Now I'd kinda like to get out of here without hurtin' you.
Don't worry about it.
[Dog Barking]
[Man]
It's Flood!
[Chattering]
That's Flood.
[Man]
He's all by himself.
Get down.
Lieutenant, this here's Jim Flood.
Lieutenant, seems to me we met someplace.
Fogarty, lock him up.
I'll see you later,
Seven.
All right, Jones.
Jones.
Yes, sir?
Write up a report.
I want details on Hennessey and bringing in Flood.
Give it to me in the morning.
Here, I'll take 'em,
Seven.
Boy, that sure was somethin', bringin' in Jim Flood.
Yeah.
Seven!
Hello.
You look tired.
I am a little.
Can I fix you some coffee?
I'd like that.
Let's see now.
After I left
Beeker's Crossing...
All right, Fred, you've got your story.
That's enough for tonight.
[Chuckles]
You shouldn't have thrown that newspaper fella out.
I could have held him spellbound for another hour or so.
But then doubtless, you wanted to have a word with me in private, huh?
[Door Closes]
I got nothing to say to you.
The service here is deplorable.
You save hanging money by letting your prisoners starve?
Supper will be brought.
If only I had a better memory.
I'm sure I've seen that distinguished face of yours.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's coming to me now a little more clear.
It happened last year.
Had something to do with a loop... or a curve or a twist.
Yeah.
That's it. A bend. That's it!
The Big Bend country.
Seems to me the fella you remind me of was sittin' behind a rock.
You spend much time sittin' behind rocks,
Lieutenant?
[Drawer Slams]
Talk like that can get you hurt.
In case you hadn't thought of it, Lieutenant, it can also get you hurt.
I doubt if anyone's gonna be fonder of you when they find out... that you deserted a Ranger named Two Jones last year, let him get killed.
Killed by you.
My guess is that you sent Seven after me hoping I'd kill him too.
With Seven Jones out of the way, you could forget the whole Jones family, maybe even forget what a coward you are.
Nobody'd ever believe you, telling a story like that.
No? The only way to find out is to tell it.
You're gonna be at the end of a rope one way or the other.
What are you after?
Sometimes I just get a calling to even things out for a friend.
You're dead set on pushing your luck, aren't you?
That's right.
I'm gonna let you out of here.
Well, that's sure neighborly of you.
You got a reputation for breaking jail.
You're gonna try a break now.
I don't know.
That doesn't seem quite honest.
Step out of the cell.
Lieutenant, before you shoot, you mind if I have another puff or two?
Well,
I better get started with the dishes.
It was a good meal.
I doubt if even Flood could have done better than that.
Flood.
I'd like to know more about him.
You seem to like him.
He's kind of a hard man to tell about.
I wish you'd try.
Well, seems almost impossible to explain, but... I'd trust him more than any man I know... with anything I had, and at the same time, know he might turn on me any minute.
What is it makes you feel that way about him?
Flood is... whatever man kinda wants to be, I guess.
Wild and free as a bird.
As free as the hawk that tried to kill my puppy?
Well, I don't think you understand what I...
Free enough to kill Hennessey?
[Gunshot]
[Shouting]
He's escaped!
He killed Herly!
Yahoo!
See you later, Seven!
[Men Shouting]
Get the doctor.
She'll be fine.
Shock's what does it when you're hit like that.
I don't suppose you'd have a cup of hot coffee, would you, Mary?
Why, certainly.
In the kitchen.
I'll get it for you.
You oughta get some sleep.
[Hoofbeats Approaching]
[Galloping Hoofbeats]
Flood!
Took me a little while to shake the Rangers.
I figured it'd take you about this long.
Gonna do you a big favor.
What's that?
Gonna give you one last chance to come along with me.
You know, Seven, you and I hit it off like nobody's business.
That's right. We did.
Well, come on then.
We'll have us a great time.
No.
I've got to stop you,
Flood.
You don't think you're gonna put me in that jail again?
I'm gonna try.
What's bothering you?
You're awful serious.
You remember firing a shot near this house when you rode out of town?
Yeah.
Well, you hit a girl.
A girl you never even knew.
You could have killed her.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You still could have killed her.
A man just can't do the things you do.
Look, Seven, we can do things that nobody's ever dreamed of.
Come on.
No.
You know as well as I do that you can't stop me.
I'll do my best.
Why?
Because of Hennessey, that girl, all the others.
It's not enough just to be sorry, Flood.
For all I know, the man who killed my brother might have been sorry.
But it didn't help.
Yeah.
Well, so long, Seven.
I've got to stop you, Jim.
Turn around.
When I first met you, you were pretty clumsy.
You've been improving.
I never knew you to be so slow.
I didn't expect you to miss like that.
At the last minute there,
I remembered you owed me $86.
Couldn't stand to lose that gambling debt.
Yeah.
[Groans]
Dolan?
Dolan!
Sorry about that bump.
Bump? What bump?
Well, now that you're awake, you gonna come up here and spell me or not?
I'm a passenger, not a driver.
Listen, Dolan...
Jump!
Now, took you long enough to get him.
Didn't.
Moved like an Apache.
Yeah, you must be gettin' old.
Must be.
Let's see the damage.
I've had worse.
Shut up and lean back.
Tie this thing, will ya?
How do you figure it, Ben?
Why the bushwhack?
That's right, ask a lot of fool questions while I bleed to death.
Well, he didn't try to kill us.
Mean anything to you? Yeah.
Means you figured on burying me here.
Now, get that coach up on its four legs, and get me...
I hope you fainted, but I doubt it.
Who is it?
It's Claire, Mr. Flood.
Hi.
I told you to be here when I got back, didn't I?
Don't be mad.
Wait'll you see what I brought.
It's the latest thing from the east.
I'm sorry, Mr. Flood.
I only wanted to surprise you...
When I tell you to do something, you damn well do it.
I know, but I thought
I'd be back...
I'll tell you when to think and what.
I just wanted to look especially nice for you.
That's all it was, Mr. Flood.
I swear.
All right, Claire, honey.
How you gonna look especially nice if you cry, huh?
I wouldn't ever do anything against you, Mr. Flood.
That's the honest truth.
What did you buy, honey?
Can I show you?
If it's something to put on, put it on.
Mr. Flood?
Yarbrough. Glad you're back.
We run into a little trouble.
Go on. Get on with it.
Well, this morning, uh, one of the new men,
Toby Wheelock...
He started roughin' up that storekeeper, McGivern.
That's your job.
I know, but sometimes them young fellers is always tryin' to make a name for themselves.
How bad is McGivern?
It ain't McGivern. It's Wheelock.
That storekeeper went and killed him with a pitch fork.
Well, McGivern knew Wheelock was one of my men.
Now that puppy dog deputy's tryin' to take hisself serious.
Says he's gonna hold McGivern for trial.
That's good enough.
He's entitled to a fair trial.
Whatever you say, Mr. Flood.
Well, that's the law.
Well, Gus, how long will it take you to round up a jury?
Oh, uh, 10, 15 minutes.
Make that a half hour.
Right, Mr. Flood.
Jace, you see anything?
I swear, I just don't know what got into me.
Stupid.
That's what I am, just plain stupid.
No argument from me.
I was just minding my own business when he comes in, and he starts shoving me around.
Like a fool, I...
I lose my temper and...
Here they come.
I should've quit this town right after the sheriff got bushwhacked.
But you didn't, Jace.
Remember that. You didn't.
Just wishin', Charlie, that's all.
Open up, Jace.
I want McGivern.
He's my prisoner, Mr. Flood.
Nobody gets him.
You're protecting a murderer, Jace.
That's my job. He gets a fair trial.
Good enough, but the town's gonna try him right now.
Uh, no, sir.
The first of the month, when the circuit judge comes by.
That's fair enough.
I mean...
Well, a week or so won't make too much difference.
Will it, Mr. Flood?
Hear that, Jace?
McGivern's got friends out here.
Sure, but I gotta wait for the judge.
You got exactly one minute to open that door, Deputy, or Nat here is gonna drop this package right down that chimney and open it for ya.
Fifty seconds.
Forty seconds.
Thirty seconds.
Jace! Give me a gun and let me out.
Twenty seconds.
Can't, Charlie.
I'll do my best, I promise you that.
Ten seconds.
You pointing that Winchester at me, sonny?
I'm ordering you and your men to leave, Mr. Flood.
You drop that gun and get out of my way right now.
Even if your men kill me, I'll still take you with me when I go down.
Then we'll both be dead.
Your choice, sonny.
You make it.
Looks like this tin is a little too heavy for you, sonny.
All right. That's enough.
Folks, a town without a duly elected sheriff becomes a lawless town.
I propose we elect a sheriff right now.
I nominate Gus Torrey.
Hey, Simms, you wanna second it?
Yeah, I second it.
Good, any other nominations?
Ryan?
You wanna nominate anybody?
Well, you're a man that usually has something to say.
Got any suggestions?
You?
Well, it looks like it's unanimous there, Jess.
Congratulations.
Do a good job for us, huh?
Well, I aim to, Mr. Flood, starting now.
Yarbrough, Simms...
I'm deputizing you.
Murderer in there wants a trial.
All right, let's pick a jury.
Johnson, Ramirez...
Uh, no.
No!
The law says you gotta give me a trial!
Jace!
Jace, for God's sake, stop them!
Stop them.
Jace!
All right.
This man killed Toby Wheelock.
In self-defense.
A man's got a right to defend himself and his property.
Sheriff. Jury?
Guilty! Guilty! No, Jace!
I told you!
I told you I was just trying to defend myself!
No... No, Jace!
Stop them! Stop them!
Somebody help me!
Give me a fair trial! Help!
Turn him loose!
Now, Molly, honey, a hanging's no place for you.
There won't be a hanging.
Jury says there will.
It's all legal.
Tell your men to turn McGivern loose.
You're interrupting justice,
Molly.
Not one more step.
Now, turn him loose.
Feels just like old times, doesn't it, honey?
Let me go!
Let go!
Get on with it.
Right, Mr. Flood.
Boys...
Hey, friend.
Yeah?
Where's the Lang and Hickman stage office?
Do you know where the
Lang stage office is?
It's down the far end of that street, going south.
Much obliged.
I'm sure glad to see you, Mr. Hickman.
My name's Dolan.
Hickman's been shot. Get a doctor.
Well, how bad is he?
Get a doctor.
Oh, yeah.
At the top of the stairs, the room to your right.
He'll need some tendin', Molly.
I'll take care of him.
Lots of strong beef broth with barley.
Yeah. That'll be $1, Mr. Dolan.
She'll pay it.
I have some money downstairs.
Tell me, Doc, do you have many hangings in this town?
Can't say.
That fella strung up in the plaza...
What did he do?
I wouldn't know.
He oughta be up and around inside a week or so.
Hope so.
You always leave them dangling overnight?
Never noticed.
Any particular reason you never noticed?
Yes, Mr. Dolan.
My wife and children.
Oh, Ben.
You've been had.
Thank you for coming over, Dan.
Not at all, Molly.
Now, don't you worry.
He'll be all right.
I helped myself to a cup of coffee.
Hope you don't mind.
How long since you ate?
This morning, King City.
I've got some cold ham.
Thank you. That would be fine.
Good.
I'm sorry about Mr. Hickman.
Well, those things happen.
I know who did it.
Looks good.
Don't you want to know?
Not particularly.
Ma'am, do you know what you do when you walk into a bad bar, and the hairs at the back of your neck stick up?
You get your drink, you pay for it, you turn around, and you walk out.
And this is a bad bar?
Yes, ma'am.
Jericho is a bad bar.
As soon as Ben's up to it, why, him and me will be leaving.
But he shot Mr. Hickman.
He'd been shot before.
All right, if it'll make you feel better, who?
Flood, Alex Flood.
Is he in Jericho?
Do you know him?
Yeah, I heard of him.
Why did you have to write Ben that letter?
I knew his reputation as a marshal before he decided to retire.
Ben's past 60.
He didn't decide to retire.
They retired him.
I didn't know that. True.
But I never lied to him.
I told him the line was in trouble, the help scared off.
He didn't tell you.
Not a word.
Sure knew your man, though.
Tell Ben there's trouble, and he'd think he's 20 years younger.
He couldn't wait to get here.
Did he mention he had an ex-deputy with him?
Yeah.
And you figured I'd come along, you'd get two professionals for the price of one.
Yes, I thought of that.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mr. Dolan, when we pick up the passengers at the Globe Relay Station on Monday, we'll be back in business.
How? Piggyback?
We'll patch up the coach and start rolling on Monday.
We can do it, Mr. Dolan.
I've got $400 invested in that coach, and that's as far as I go.
No sense throwing good money after bad.
I'm a gambler.
I play the percentages, and I don't like the odds.
Then there's nothing more I can say?
No, ma'am.
Well...
What happened to your husband?
Husbands. I've been widowed twice.
They die in bed?
My first husband got hit by a stray bullet in a drunken gunfight, and Frank got his head kicked in by a mean colt... out here in the corral.
Your husbands don't seem to have much luck.
They thought different.
They say so?
I know so.
Been a widow very long?
Not long enough for it to bother me, so don't let it bother you.
I wasn't going to.
Any more questions?
Yes.
Where do I sleep?
The spare room's to the left.
The bed's made.
Thank you. Good night.
Mr. Dolan.
Good night, Ms. Lang.
How you feeling?
Lousy barley.
Man can't live on this slop unless'n he has something to wash it down with.
I'll see what I can do.
Well, howdy. False rumor, Jess.
We heard Molly's new partner was shot.
You heard right. Ben Hickman.
He's upstairs.
The old marshal?
One of the greats in his time,
Jess.
Still better than most.
Good friend of yours?
Sort of partners. My name's Dolan.
Oh, I'm Flood.
This is Sheriff Torrey.
Molly's in town, looking for a wheel for that busted coach.
Back watchers?
No, deputies.
Jess always keeps them handy.
How many you got, Jess?
Fourteen, Mr. Flood.
We need them to keep the peace.
No guns allowed in town.
You looking for something?
Whiskey. Oh, not there.
Try the cupboard.
No, on the right, second shelf.
Thanks.
Want me to question the old man now,
Mr. Flood?
I don't know. Uh, Dolan?
How's the marshal feeling?
Good enough.
Well, ask him if he's up to answering some questions, huh?
Sure.
Ben?
Sheriff's downstairs.
Wanna see him?
Why, sure. Why not?
What the hell you call that?
That's no drink.
Give me my regular three fingers.
You want it or not?
You're rattlesnake mean, Dolan.
Sheriff's with a friend of Ms. Lang's, name "Flood".
You owe me two and half fingers.
She ever mention that name to you?
I never talked to Ms. Lang before this morning, when she was bandaging me.
You didn't answer my question.
And you didn't give me my drink.
Must be her coming home.
Did you give her the money to buy a new wheel?
You mean she got us a new wheel?
Get out of my house, Flood.
That's no way to talk, Molly.
I said get out of my house!
And take your hangman with you.
I think this batch of cookies has too much vanilla in it, honey.
Mr. Dolan, kick him out.
Never step in between close friends or argue with the law.
You can't blame her for being excited, Dolan.
Longest run of tough luck
I ever did see.
And, Molly, honey, you just say the word and I'll have a new coach out there for you in time to make that run.
That's a nice offer, Ms. Lang.
For 51% of the line?
You can go to hell, Flood.
I'll be rolling on schedule without you.
I hope so, Molly.
I really do, but the way your luck's been runnin'...
My only bad luck is you're not dead yet.
Ms. Lang, you have a sick man upstairs.
Least you can do is take care of him.
Do I go along, Mr. Flood?
He's fit.
"Do I go along, Mr. Flood?
"Do I go on breathing, Mr. Flood?
"Do I go on living, Mr. Flood?"
Feisty, but lovable.
Sit down, Dolan.
Thanks, but...
I like the view better over here.
Of course. Have one.
All right.
You swing a lot of weight around here.
Only 51% of everything I touch, except the Lang stage line.
Lang and Hickman.
Oh, the pain will wear off.
Hickman's deputy in Santa Fe, weren't you?
Used to be.
Forty a month, every month you were alive to collect it.
That why you quit Abilene four years back?
Oh, I got $50 a month.
Now I got a town, Dolan, a town, cattle, part of a mine territory.
They brought me in to tame it, and I stayed to take my profits.
Is this tamed?
I don't think you'll hear any complaints.
Well, one exception.
Don't you think she can be tamed?
Haven't thought about it one way or another.
No? After sleeping under the same roof?
It's a big roof.
Small town, Dolan.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
The hotel is usually all full up.
Your hotel. Only 51%.
I'll tell 'em you're coming over, and they'll fix up something real special for you.
Real thoughtful.
Ex-lawman to ex-lawman, it's my pleasure.
Mr. Flood?
Seems the old man didn't see the bushwhacker, but he said maybe he did.
Ex-lawman to ex-lawman, I wouldn't recognize him if I was sitting right here in the same room with him.
But you know something, Flood?
You're right.
Little too much vanilla in those cookies.
Dolan, when you get in town, you look me up, huh?
Ace-Deuce Palace.
Try your luck?
Maybe later.
I'll take three.
Just looked over your 51%.
Very nice.
Hotel says you didn't show.
Couldn't. Ben worries about his health.
Oh, when Hickman worries, you worry?
Used to be the other way around.
Like to sit in?
Buy you a drink instead.
No, my place. I'll do the buying.
I was hoping you'd say that.
What's that "uh-uh" mean?
I don't like the odds put on any of those deal sliders.
Sure?
It's my business to be sure.
Harv?
Yes, Mr. Flood.
Table five, Joe Ross...
He's all thumbs.
Fire him.
Fire him?
Yeah, fire him.
Yes, sir.
Found out yet who ambushed you?
Injuns? Hold-up crew?
I figure Indians or somebody with just about as much know-how.
Ever do any injun fightin'?
Little.
You know, I was thinking.
You walk like an Indian.
Lived with 'em a long time back.
May I?
Certainly, Claire.
Sit and have a drink.
Thank you, Mr. Flood.
This is Dolan.
Pleased to meet you, I'm sure,
Mr. Dolan.
Likewise, Miss Claire.
You like my friend, honey?
Do you want me to like him,
Mr. Flood?
No.
Dolan knows I share nothing with nobody.
Except whiskey and cookies.
Joan?
Would you like to meet a girl,
Mr. Dolan?
Thank you, ma'am.
I'll let you know if I do.
Here's to fun and...
You hear what he's tellin' us to do, cousin Purley?
Hand it over.
And just who in the hell's gonna make me?
Just obeying orders, mister.
You gotta check it.
This gun goes where I go.
Hey, big man.
Law says no guns.
You the law?
No, I am.
Yeah? Yeah.
Well, I don't see no badge.
I don't need no badge, big mouth.
It's up there on the ledge.
He levelin', Purley?
He's levelin'.
Okay, friend. You win.
All of it, mister.
Under the coat.
Sure, why in the hell not?
You.
Clean.
The knife inside your boot.
Flood!
Harv?
Arrest him.
Boys, get him out of here.
Let's get back to the tables, boys.
The louse cut you.
Go on over and get me another jacket, will you, honey?
Are you all right, Mr. Flood?
I'm fine... The gray jacket.
Thanks for the yell, Dolan.
Old habit.
A man's back's a tender spot.
You did all right.
Is that why you didn't step in?
Stepping in's a habit I outgrew.
That's smart.
Helps a man stay alive a long time.
Phil?
Lock him up.
We'll hang him after the trial.
Jericho's a law-abiding town, Dolan.
Here's to law and order.
Good morning.
Good morning. Good morning, sir.
What would you like for breakfast?
Same thing as Ben had.
His plate's so clean
I can't tell what it was.
Just ham and eggs.
Ben, he goes for home-cookin'.
You don't?
No, ma'am.
Oh, that's Frank Ryan and his boy.
They have the general store here.
They're good friends of mine.
They'd like to meet you.
I won't be around long enough to make friends.
We can beat him, Mr. Dolan.
- Believe me, we can.
- You can't.
I saw the town last night.
Monday, Ben and me will be gone.
Oh, Ben say so?
He will when he hears the count.
And I can go to the devil.
Or to Flood.
All you have to do is say the word.
I have. The word is "never."
It wasn't always.
No, not when he first came here to do a job that needed doing.
He stopped all the killings and stealing.
Everybody in this town looked up to him.
We were mistaken.
Me, most of all.
49% of something is better than 100% of nothing.
No.
Your choice.
If I could get help, six men or more, good men, then will you and Ben stay on?
Merchants?
We're going to have a meeting at Ryan's place.
Sheep against wolves.
Talk sense, Ms. Lang.
You have two choices, give Flood what he wants or pack up and move along.
Everything inside your head are odds, percentages.
You know Flood shot Ben, but that doesn't matter.
You don't like the odds so you cut and run.
You aren't very much of a man, are you, Mr. Dolan?
Ms. Lang, you're burning breakfast.
Oh, damn!
Just as well.
Man who gets too attached to home-cookin' can't think straight.
I'll eat breakfast in town.
Mr. Dolan, hold off telling Ben till after the meeting?
Give me a chance to change the odds.
I'm sorry, Ms. Lang.
Why won't Pa let me stay up tonight?
Your pa has his reasons.
Now, don't you ask again, ya hear?
Come back to try your luck?
Yes, ma'am.
Pot's open for five.
Without me.
Call.
Your five and 10. Fold.
Pass.
Call.
Cards.
One.
Dealer takes one.
Better odds tonight?
Much.
Bet 10.
Call.
Kings and treys.
Beats jacks and nines.
Looks like you know your business,
Dolan.
It's a living.
Carl?
Yes, Mr. Flood.
How much you got in your bank, Dolan?
Bring me $462 out of petty cash.
Yes, sir.
Open for five.
Call.
Out.
My five.
Fold.
Buy you a drink?
No, thanks. Never drink when I'm working.
Your deal, Mr. Flood.
Didn't expect to see you here tonight, Dolan.
Why not?
Figured you'd be tied up in a meeting.
Bet five.
What meeting?
Call.
Raise 10.
Secret meeting, Ryan's house, 10:00.
Call the raise.
Don't know any Ryans.
How much longer do you intend to wait, Molly?
Miller's usually ahead of time.
It's nothing.
I'm sure Miller will be here soon.
Maybe he ain't comin'.
Likely he ain't.
His wife's dead set against it.
I don't want this to take anymore time than it has to, so let's get started.
You talk, Dolan.
Right, but softly.
Twenty.
I'm feeling charitable in a small way.
Raise you 20.
- What was that?
- I don't know.
Let's take a look. Come on.
Down the street, Ryan's store...
Alterations.
It's been raised.
You callin' or foldin'?
Callin'.
And 40 more.
Confident.
Forty... And 60.
Go.
Two.
Same.
That's a nice-lookin' watch.
Runs a few minutes fast.
How much you got there, Dolan?
That's the bet.
Hey, you hear that?
- What was it?
- One hell of an explosion!
Come on!
Sounds to me like the meeting's adjourned.
The bet's 646 to you, Dolan.
She's all right.
Things that belong to me never get damaged.
You callin' my hand?
I'd never face myself if I didn't.
You're called.
Three of a kind.
Same.
Tens.
Queens.
Can't win them all.
Your turn to buy.
Glad you won, Dolan.
That'll give you and the old marshal traveling money.
And the sooner, the better.
Or the first thing I know, you and me are liable to wind up being friends.
Ms. Lang?
Are you all right?
Go ahead and cry.
You got a right.
Last thing I need is your advice.
Easy, that'll knock you on your ear.
It's my ear.
Yarbrough and Simms really had a great time.
They dragged us out of the house.
Aggie Ryan fought like a tiger.
They planted dynamite and blew her home to bits.
Years of scrimping and saving...
Everything they owned!
Do you know that...
Eh, you wouldn't.
Maybe I would.
The hell you would.
They made us stand there while they took Ryan.
And in front of his wife and son, beat him and beat him and...
Beat him.
First one, then the other!
Laughing all the time they did it.
I'm sorry it happened.
Hurray for being sorry.
Mr. Dolan, you stink.
Go ahead, get it off your chest.
You're damn right.
I've got some things I wanna say to you, Mr. Dolan.
Just a few.
I'm not in any hurry.
You can't wait to high-tail it out of Flood's sight.
Right.
You got a yellow streak down your back this wide.
This wide? Right.
That's what I said.
I just don't understand you,
Mr. Dolan.
Ben, I understand.
Fred and Aggie Ryan, people all over the world.
Even a louse like Alex Flood
I understand.
You really are a stinker, Mr. Dolan.
I know what you're thinking.
"I told you so."
That's what you're thinking.
Sheep.
Wolves against sheep.
Go on, all right.
Why don't you tell me how right you were?
I just don't understand you,
Mr. Dolan.
Ben, Aggie, Frank Ryan,
I understand.
People all over the world,
I understand.
Even Alex Flood...
Mr. Dolan, you are a bastard.
I'm going to bed.
I'm gonna kiss you.
You didn't have to do that.
Just can't figure you, Dolan.
Just can't figure you.
Mr. Dolan?
Somebody ought to put dynamite down your chimney.
Good morning.
I'm sorry I'm late getting started.
You and Ben must be starved.
Ham steaks and fried potatoes all right?
Give me a chunk of that bacon grease, will you?
I could do with some more firewood if you're up to chopping it.
Anytime.
Mr. Dolan, if you can't handle whisky, you shouldn't drink.
Who put who to bed last night?
I'll have your breakfast going soon.
No hurry.
Rough night?
Yeah.
Dolan told me about your pulling out as soon as you're strong enough.
I want to thank you for your offer of leaving the coach.
Well, don't thank me.
That was Dolan's idea.
Kind of a hard fella to figure out, ain't he?
Yes, he is.
Whaddya think you'd do if you were him?
That's even harder to figure.
Mrs. Lang?
You know something?
I wish I was 10 years younger.
So do I, Mr. Hickman.
Thanks.
I'll have breakfast ready in no time.
No, thanks.
Think I'll go into town and get some whisky.
Ben will be wanting his three fingers, and we're fresh out.
Comes from having a drunk in the house.
Two.
Visitors.
Hired killers.
Badge gives them a license.
Mrs. Lang.
About this coach, got some things I wanna tell ya.
You mean ordered to tell me.
Yeah, that's right.
I've been lookin' forward to it.
This paper here says you ain't paid your bills or the bank.
They'll be paid.
Hey, get away from that coach.
Some coach.
Sure is tore up inside.
Don't touch it!
Sure is flimsy, ain't it?
Leave it alone!
You wanna bet I can't tear this off with one hand?
Ha!
You wanna bet you don't?
You interferin' with the law,
Dolan?
I wouldn't think of it.
Just protecting private property.
That coach is mine.
That's not what this paper says.
Read it yourself.
Drop your gun belts.
Anytime.
I never hurry a man wants to die.
You won't get out of town alive,
Dolan.
My problem.
Yours is getting out of here.
Now, drop it.
You too, Yarbrough.
Come on.
Now...
Throw them in the horse trough.
You must be crazy, Dolan.
You know who we work for.
It's your turn, Dolan.
Throw that Winchester in the horse trough.
Just a little more tightening's all she'll need.
Hook 'im, Mr. Flood!
Ride him, Mr. Flood!
Right in there!
Attaboy!
Way to ride.
Nice ridin', Mr. Flood.
Terrific!
Sure likes to jump.
Nasty enough to be mine.
Don't look like she's gonna stay busted, Mr. Flood.
Well, then, we'll just go around and around again.
I hope he likes it same as me.
You said last night nothing belongs to you ever gets damaged.
That's right.
You forgot to tell your men.
What did you use on 'em?
Single tree.
Oh. Where's Simms?
I don't know.
Probably at the doctor's.
That man was a deputy.
Way I look at it, a man starts choking a woman is looking to go to hell in a hurry.
All I did was oblige him.
Same as you do, Mr. Flood.
Well, the problem is you're you and I'm me.
Different privileges.
Majority rules.
Why don't you take your traveling money and clear out?
Can't wait to do it soon as
Ben's fit.
He's fit enough.
Why don't you just leave town the way you came in, in this coach?
Tomorrow, 'bout 9:00 or 10:00.
Whatever's best.
9:00. It's earlier.
You want me to take him with me?
You killed him, you bury him.
Oh, and Dolan...
One minute after 9:00, and I'll hang you.
No question about it, Dolan.
You gotta pull out like he said, or he'll hang you for sure.
Sick man like me...
Even Flood would give me a day or two.
No, Dolan. Too much light.
Hurts my eyes.
I figured you'd be fit enough to ride out with me now.
I wish to God I could, but I'll meet up with you wherever you say.
Waco.
All right.
I could sure use three fingers to kill this pain.
Hurts that bad, huh?
Yeah, it comes and goes.
No, don't touch... You can't...
I ain't leavin', and I ain't meetin' up with ya.
You gave me your word.
I know I did.
But I gotta break it.
You never took...
And nothing you can say's gonna change my mind.
Come Monday, hell or high water, that coach is gonna do what it's supposed to do.
It's gonna pull out on schedule.
Oh, stop talking like a damn fool.
If you want to commit suicide, get back into bed and blow your head off.
At least you'll die comfortable.
I came here because you asked me to.
Now I'm asking you to leave.
You owe me that much, Ben.
More...
Much more, but I owe myself, too.
Any man there is, Dolan, has to have some reason to get up in the morning.
Oh, that's very touching.
We'll put that on your tombstone.
"Here lies Ben Hickman,
"who had to have a reason to get up in the morning."
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you admit you're too old?
This isn't Tucson 15 years ago.
This is Jericho.
You're 63, and there's a town full of guns out there.
Those are the facts.
You're thinking with this instead of this.
And in our business, that's when they bury you!
And you know it!
Now, get your gear together, and let's get out of here.
So long, Dolan.
Nothing but the best to you.
We're obliged to you, Mr. Dolan.
Never thought I'd see you again.
What are the odds?
You got a glass?
Got three of them.
I told Molly we'd be needing them when you got back.
Molly!
Molly?
See?
I told you, never argue with the best friend of a best friend.
You know he'll hang you, Dolan.
Probably.
Over my dead body.
Most likely.
Your friend Ryan... Will he fight?
Oh, he'd die trying.
That brings the odds way down.
Only 10 to one.
Jace!
He was acting sheriff until he tried to stop a lynching.
Anybody else?
Nobody that I can think of.
Four guns makes it nine to one.
Eight to one. You forgot me.
Yes, sir.
Just 10 years younger.
Well, I see you're eight minutes ahead of a rope, huh?
Too bad we never got a chance to get together, Marshal.
From what I've been hearing, it's my pleasure.
Got yourself a pretty salty partner, Dolan.
Still time to buy you a last drink.
Only minutes ahead of a rope makes swallowing too tough.
But maybe we'll run into each other again someday.
You ever run into me again, you still won't like the odds.
Certain plans I've made don't include having you around.
Do we understand each other?
Majority rules.
Why did you have to say I was 63 in front of Mrs. Lang?
Sixty-four come August.
Cheer up.
We'll be at Flood's herd pretty soon, and you're still not too old to rustle.
Molly, why don't you simmer down?
And why don't you just get out?
Now, wait a minute,
I came her real nice with my hat in my hand and thought maybe...
I'm not interested.
Molly, I have to treat everybody the same in this town.
Now, you don't really think
I give a damn about cuttin' in on this place.
The only thing I wanna do is take over you, dear, for better or worse.
That's all over, Flood.
It used to be "Alex," honey.
And you used to be different.
Different?
A hired gunslinger?
No, a law man, proud of his job.
How can you be proud on 50 a month?
- Is that the kind of a man you want?
- I did.
But not now.
That's right.
Well, let's find out.
Well, you didn't help much.
You turn my stomach.
Dolan?
Is that what you think?
I'm asking you.
That's why you ran him out of town.
I didn't like him living under the same roof with you.
Not just under the same roof,
Flood.
And I loved every minute of it.
That's for lying.
Am I lying?
Did he or didn't he?
You'll never know.
You lousy tramp.
Yes or no?
If you want that stage to roll, come see me.
Only don't walk. Crawl.
You like for me to shave you, don't you, Mr. Flood?
Among other things, I like for you to shave me, yes.
Can I ask you something else,
Mr. Flood?
Barber's privilege.
Did she ever shave you?
I changed my mind.
I don't like for you to shave me.
I know I said the wrong thing.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Flood.
- Who is it?
Gus Torrey, Mr. Flood.
Come in.
- Please, Mr. Flood, don't be mad...
- Shut up.
What's the trouble?
I just heard that 50 head are missing from your south range, Mr. Flood.
When?
Oh, it was an hour or so ago.
I just sent six men out to track them.
You know, it sure don't figure.
Who'd be crazy enough to run off any of your cattle?
Sure makes a man wonder, don't it?
I count six.
That's a start.
You make a fine cup of coffee,
Mrs. Lang.
Oh, thanks. Oh, that reminds me.
I've got some hardtack, too.
- Like some?
- Yeah.
- Molly.
- Dolan.
Torrey sent out six men to track the cattle.
We saw them.
Who did that?
Flood.
It's not important.
It is to me.
Howdy, Ben. Ryan, how are ya?
Howdy. You must be Marshal Hickman.
I heard about you from my...
Yeah, well, don't say it.
Even if you heard about me from your daddy, don't say it.
No, sir. I won't.
Glad to have you with us, Deputy.
Ex-deputy.
Talk like that upsets me, son.
Man puts himself down sounds to me like an amateur.
Probably fights like one.
Difference between an amateur and a professional...
Professional figures out a way to cut down the odds before he makes his move.
Now, me and Dolan...
We're professionals.
That's why you and
Ryan here are lucky.
You're about to become the beneficiaries of our experience.
Right, Dolan?
Right.
One of Marshal Hickman's shorter lectures.
I'll fight, Mr. Hickman.
How much dynamite you got,
Ryan?
Plenty.
Jace, you and Ben hit the main ranch house.
Ryan, you...
Flood owes me a house.
All right, Ryan.
That leaves you the big granary.
I'll take care of the mine.
All right, let's move.
Hey, Dolan.
What about me?
You go home.
Damned if I will.
But first, douse the fire.
I can smell that coffee for a mile.
Can I get ya somethin' to eat,
Mr. Flood?
Can I get you something to eat?
No, no, no, I'm all right.
There oughta be some word on my cattle by now.
Well, look, I'll go check.
Any word?
No, not yet, Mr. Flood.
But I told them they better not come back without your cattle, so I'm sure...
What was that?
- Sounded like dynamite!
- Not far from town.
That's not far off.
Exactly one mile.
Your granary.
That first one was my ranch house.
What the hell's going on here?
They're working me over in a circle.
Start north with the cattle.
Ranch is east.
Granary's south.
The next is west.
The mine.
I want a dozen men in five minutes.
Come on.
Come on.
Listen.
Someone's back.
I told you there's nothing to worry about.
He'll probably want a drink.
It's Jace.
You all right, Jace?
Scared, but I'm used to that.
No Dolan?
Nope.
Well, this is gettin' to look like a wake.
I think I'll stretch out upstairs.
Doesn't look too good, does it?
He's not worried, why should we be?
- I got his horse.
- He's down there.
There he is.
Dolan!
It's hangin' time.
He's trapped.
We'll go down after him.
Suppose Dolan doesn't make it.
He will.
- Relax.
- Yeah, like you.
How come you didn't sleep?
I wasn't tired.
It's Dolan.
We haven't got much time.
It'll be daylight soon.
Drink up.
Thanks.
Took you long enough for a simple job.
Worried about me?
Me? Not a fraction.
Mr. Hickman.
Do you always put black queens on black kings?
Sure. I cheat.
And win.
Congratulations.
All right, Jace, give me the rundown.
Eleven men left in town, counting Simms.
Three patrolling, two on duty at the jail.
This where I check my gun, gentlemen?
Joe'll take it, Pop.
Are you jokin'?
Do I look like it?
All right, peel 'em off, boys.
Hurry up.
There I am, sitting quietly at the bar...
It's very late. Please go away.
- I look over my shoulder...
- Lady, I just want a little drink.
Some other time, mister.
I don't want some other time.
Mister, we got laws in this town.
All right, what's going on here?
Now turn around easy.
Very good.
Anytime.
Well, no sign of him.
He couldn't have gotten far.
Yeah.
Where's Phillips?
He's right back...
Phillips?
We're short one man, one horse.
Let's get back to town.
Wait here. If we don't come out, you're on your own.
He said to wait here.
Try it again.
The setup's like you said.
Good. Remember, don't move until you get to 40.
Look who's teachin' me how to suck egg.
Difference between a professional and an amateur.
Checkin' it... 7...
Charley?
Hey, Grandpa!
Turn in that gun.
Hey!
No!
This belongs to you.
Thanks.
Go ahead, Sheriff.
Give 'em hell.
Just stay where you are, all of you!
I got things to say, and you best listen.
You just got up off the floor, and you're stayin' up.
We've been livin' on our knees long enough.
Damn you!
Look at me!
We've been given a chance to take back our town.
Now, who's gonna stand up and take that chance?
You figure to start us off,
Miller?
Count me in.
Me, too.
I'll go along.
So will I.
Ryan.
You go to the Ace-Deuce and wait till this is over.
All right.
Ryan, can you get a team and hitch this buckboard?
Sure, right away.
We're all set.
These men are willing to fight.
Better than I expected.
Sir, I kind of changed my mind.
I got to think of my family.
You wanna go home?
Sure do.
Get.
All right, you two boys come with me.
You, you, get in the wagon.
Jace, get this rig ready to block the north street.
Right.
Get up on that roof.
Take the middle window in the hardware store.
You all set?
I'll tell you when.
Evening, Mr. Flood.
Quiet enough.
Yeah, let's split up.
Meet you in front of the hotel.
All right, Mr. Flood.
Mr. Flood!
Go back. It's a trap!
Go back!
Yaah!
Ben! Get back!
I... I... I fought for you.
- Hold 'em high!
- Don't shoot, don't shoot.
- Off your horse!
- All right, step down,
- Hold 'em high!
- ...and do it quick.
Come on!
Now, give me that real easy.
Dolan, it's all over!
We've been...
Flood.
Dolan.
Don't take less than...
Fifty-one percent.
Take a good look at him.
He's the bad guy.
And Joe Jarrett... that's me...
and Zack Thomas, we're the good guys.
Let's go!
Tell the driver to stop!
Tell him to surrender.
I'm with the railroad. Tell him
I demand he gives up the money.
- Our lives are worth more than money!
- Did you mention money?
There's $100,000 on this stagecoach.
$100,000? I'm glad
I'm fighting for a worthy cause.
- I hate to waste ammunition.
- You're not a railroad man, are you?
I'm anybody's man, mostly my own.
Get ready.
Swing out!
Move up on the outside.
The other window.
"To Jonas Ansel, for 20 years'...
...unwavering loyalty.
Thaddeus Markham, President,
Texas Interstate Railroad."
It chimes.
Look out!
Get out of there!
Keep after them!
Hold it!
They're picking us off like flies.
Whoa up there, you jugheads! Whoa!
Hold on down there.
I'll get them under control.
Whoa!
- What about Zack Thomas?
- That's him driving the stage.
Burden said to get
Zack Thomas and the money.
- So?
- So I was just wondering.
Well, stop wondering.
- Anybody else just wondering?
- Nope. Not me, boss.
I'm going back to Galveston.
I'll have this under control in a minute.
Yeah, you do that.
Hang on to your hat, Ansel.
Here we go!
They tried to tell me the meek would inherit the earth.
Kinda awkward, me having the drop on you, huh?
Hold that!
Back off!
- Where's the little man in there?
- Ansel? He was took dead.
This can't be his money.
He was so anxious to give it away.
- He's just a railroad agent.
- Transporting for the railroad.
They overcharged me for years.
This can be a rebate.
- He left that as a little remembrance?
- The scarf?
It was his dying wish.
He insisted.
He insisted you take the watch too?
You wouldn't believe it.
That fellow was all heart.
It chimes.
Start loading.
Paper money first.
Don't pout. Just fill the bag.
Hurry it up.
It's gonna be easy to spend.
Don't forget all the sacks.
The Good Book says:
"Cheaters never prosper.
Square-shooters always win."
Come on. Lay it up here.
Change the literature. What you're reading ain't doing you good.
They said that before
I burned down the Sunday school.
- Anything else, master?
- Unhitch me a horse.
- Now.
- Yes, sir.
Looks like money. Feels like money.
Sounds like money.
- It's a lovely sound.
- Pity it ain't all gold.
You'd pleasure yourself to death listening to it.
I figure you got a name, boy.
Thomas. Zachariah Thomas.
And you?
- I'll find out sooner or later.
- Jarrett. Joe Jarrett.
Well, Joe, I think there's something you should know.
This ain't railroad money.
It's investment money.
You see, there's a man over in Galveston's got an idea.
So the president of the railroad financed him.
You saying he smooth-talked Markham out of $100,000?
Yep. Me.
- You?
- Me.
- I think I underrated you.
- I think you did, Joe.
You're just slow in catching on.
But I'm beginning to like you, Joe.
- I might cut you in.
- Don't talk me out of this loot.
- I'm not a soft-hearted president.
- I want to talk you into something.
- Now this here's a lot of money.
- Ordinarily $100,000 would be...
...enough for two, but not me.
You see, I was born greedy.
If my plan works, we'll get a half a million a year.
- Thank you, Zack.
- Now you wanna buy in?
I'll quit while I'm ahead.
Nothing personal, mind you.
I'm beginning to like you too.
A man who tries to con you with a gun on him can't be bad.
Like you just said,
I guess you underrated me, Joe.
I'll tell you why I didn't go for your proposition, Zack.
You don't have the proper respect for a man's money.
I appreciate your thinking about it.
Zachariah, rest easy.
I'm gonna put this here money to good use.
Zachariah, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
I was gonna give you a break.
I'm starting to change the rules,
Zachariah.
Why you dirty...
You no-good son of a...
What's the matter?
You need a rifle if you wanna play this game, Joe.
Sorry, Joe. I still can't hear you.
Zack, you're calling the rules. What you want?
I can hear you better now, Joe.
Throw those guns down.
Both of them.
Yours and mine.
Walk to me with your hands up where I can see them.
Both hands.
That's right, Joe.
Keep walking towards me.
That's fine.
Hot day for a stroll, ain't it, Joe?
They tell me them boots ain't built for walking.
They ain't exactly house slippers.
- I thought you'd never get here.
- I've been thinking it over.
Now, mind you,
I'm not saying yes, but...
...you know, I wanna talk about that business proposition.
Forget it. They don't build riverboats big enough for the two of us.
Riverboat?
I'm gonna take the horses.
What about me?
Know what the Injun said when asked why he rode and the squaw walked?
He said,
"She got no 'hoss."'
Take the horses and walk to the money. I'll be right behind you.
If that's what he said he was a smart Indian.
Start with the guns and the carpetbag.
Why not?
It looks like it's your money.
You're agreeable for a man about to lose $100,000.
Easy come, easy go.
- Sure is hot.
- It's gonna get hotter too.
- Along noon, it will be a scorcher.
- For you. Drop it.
Come on, Zack. That's it.
Now back off.
You shouldn't play aces in another man's game.
How about those horses?
You can't ride all of them.
This is a set and I wouldn't want to break it up.
You were right about those boots.
They ain't made for walking.
And like the Indian said,
"You ain't got no 'hoss."'
So long, Zachariah.
Careful of sunstroke.
It gets hot this time of day.
Serves me right for trusting that miserable...
Young ladies and young gentlemen.
One of you is naughty.
I felt something hit my, my... person.
I'm going to turn my back...
...and I want the owner of that insidious instrument...
...to place it on the ground behind me.
Remember, young ladies and gentlemen...
...l'm putting you on your honor.
Well, I'm waiting.
We don't have all day.
I'm glad to know that there is honor amongst you.
- "Honor, in the final analysis..."
- "...is all that man has."
Joseph.
- Joseph Jarrett!
- Won't you change your quotes?
- Put me down.
- Not until you let me have a big kiss.
What have you been doing?
After I left here I got out of law school. Drifted some.
Practiced a little.
Spent a couple years in the war.
On the wrong side, naturally.
Then I came right back here.
Poor Mr. Lantern.
He died, you know.
Since then, we haven't been able to meet the mortgage.
- Well, how much is it?
- It's a great deal of money.
Much more than you make practicing law in a year.
Well now, would it be more than that?
You made all that practicing law?
Not exactly. I invested a little in transportation.
Stagecoach lines and railroads, you know.
You put it all in a stagecoach line?
That's risky. Be careful.
Just the other day, the stage was robbed and people were killed.
- Somebody got away with $100,000.
- Yeah, I heard that.
The local authorities, do they know who did it? No.
You haven't even thanked me for the money.
I'll thank you, just as soon as you get out of those clothes.
In that outfit, you'll be nabbed for sure.
No smiling Joe Jarrett, no ma'am.
I'm heading for Galveston.
There's bigger thieves than me
running every bank in town.
It's Mr. Burden! Mr. Burden!
- Don't go away, Mr. Burden!
- Please wait! Mr. Burden!
Mr. Burden, could we talk to you?
We sure would aspire to talk to you.
- You know that we're both widows.
- As a banker...
...I am proud to serve the widows of this community and the orphans.
It is my sacred trust to protect...
...the savings that mean so much to your future.
The boarding house has been losing money.
We thought a clean coat of paint...
...would help business and...
- We'd like to borrow $100.00.
Nothing would delight me more.
- Bless you, Mr. Burden.
- But...
...if I loan money to widows, they might be late with the payments.
Mightn't they?
You wouldn't want a sensitive man like myself...
...to foreclose on poor widows and orphans...
...and throw them out into the streets, now would you?
Of course not, Mr. Burden.
I knew you'd see it my way.
- Good morning, ladies!
- Good morning, Mr. Burden!
He's absolutely right.
- We've been thoughtless.
- And he put it so nicely.
- It's worse than war.
- What war? There you are.
Please, I know you're upset.
Give me time.
Gentlemen.
Please.
- Heart attacks he gives me.
- He has to be destroyed.
Gentlemen,
Williams was right.
This is a war.
The war between us and Zack Thomas.
Beg my pardon. Crab Orleans.
Tasty, but too rich.
Burden, we'll all thank you for your report on Zack Thomas.
Yes, and about time.
Yes. Of course.
Well, they say he got away with the money.
That's regrettable.
You'll have to fight for your lives, your business lives.
I suggest $5,000 apiece to the war chest.
- $5,000? I could buy a mountain...
- Gentlemen.
Gentlemen!
We wanted an open town and we got it with Zack Thomas.
And a black day it was.
My store caters to the homespun desires of the Galveston housewife.
I've been paying a part of my income to this Thomas for nearly three years.
I never liked it and I like it even less.
I agree Zack has been taking his job too seriously.
I realized that when he said my bank was like a gambling house...
...and demanded a piece of the action. Now he has to go.
With capital, he'll call the tune.
He'll drive us out of business.
- Marie.
- Oui, madame.
- Wash and air this in that order.
- Oui, madame.
And try to stay out of Mr. Thomas' way.
- He doesn't like too much help.
- Oui, madame.
- And neither do I.
- Oui, madame.
"Joe Jarrett.
Wanted for 16 counts of larceny, embezzlement...
...grand theft, fraud and disorderly conduct."
Not bad.
A shave, a bath.
Quite handsome, actually.
"Disorderly conduct."
Elya.
- Did you find that circular?
- Yes, and don't roar.
Stop mooning over that cheap four-flusher's picture. Bring it here.
Coming, dear.
"Coming, dear."
Tell me, Susie, Fifi...
...what does that mean in woman's talk? Ten, five minutes?
A little higher, please.
- No, no more.
- Oui, Monsieur Thomas.
So, it means,
"Oui, Monsieur Thomas."
Oui, Monsieur Thomas.
Nothing like a straight answer to make a fellow feel secure.
I feel like there's a conspiracy going on.
Not against me. That I could handle.
This is more devious.
Every damn thing I want is done one second before I want it done.
But Mr. Thomas, we just do what Madame Carlson tells us to.
Of course. Of course.
- I hope you enjoyed the rubdown today.
- It was exciting.
I hope I didn't make your shower too hot.
I doubt if you could make anything too hot for Mr. Thomas, dear.
Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you?
Of course. Am I not indispensable?
Well, I...
Girls that giggle are not for you.
When they stop giggling...
...I fire them.
Yes, I noticed quite a turnover.
You have to get older before you get girls as young as that.
How about a week or so?
That'll be fine.
Out, all of you. And try not to trip over your own feet.
- Mr. Thomas' shoes need a brush-up.
- Oui, madame.
Five thousand dollars.
You want to take my blood too?
Here's my contribution.
Gentlemen, thank you.
Thank you, gentlemen. It is...
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Just leave your money on the table.
It's a bank. It should be safe.
Amuse yourselves.
Have an apple.
Matson, I asked you always to meet me at my house.
You were supposed to get rid of Zack and bring me the money.
You did neither.
Can you give me a reason why I should pay you?
I lost six of my best men.
That's six good reasons.
There was no need to lose those men.
Perhaps you just handled it badly.
When we planned it...
...nobody said a thing about a sharpshooter on that stage.
That's right. We didn't know that.
He might have been hired by Zack.
It don't matter now.
Six men are dead, ain't they?
Now you pay me all of it.
Matson, remove your hand!
That's a Chinese silk shirt!
I'll pay you.
Harvey, you should've hired me instead of passing me up for Zack.
Now you'll have to hire me to put a bullet in his brain.
I'm telling you now, the day I deliver his body...
...l'm gonna want a lot more money than this.
And just as a bonus,
I'm gonna want Zack Thomas' job.
Like this, you've got...
...me and all this and Texas too.
Just a touch.
You know how I like them.
- Don't say, "Oui, Monsieur Thomas."
- Oui, Monsieur Thomas.
I apologize for the intrusion,
Madame Carlson.
This brute has forced me to wait in the hall and it's important.
- Should I throw him out?
- Throw me out!
Remember, I'm the president of the bank...
...where your employer does business!
- I remember.
- Want me to throw him out?
- No, show him this.
Sure, boss. Here.
I'll be waiting for you in the bedroom.
Won't take long.
I'll be right there.
You figure it's the same fellow on the coach?
- The one that got away with the money?
- That's him.
Why did you let him get away with it?
I mean, $100,000.
He gave me a story about not having had a hot meal.
Beside, what are you so concerned about? It's my $100,000.
She want something?
I don't think you fit the bill, Harv.
Here, boss.
I think madame wants a shine.
What are you gonna do about that $100,000?
If you were a young fellow full of beans with $100,000...
...where would you go?
How should I know?
I loathe beans.
I figure Jarrett would head for some wide-open town.
Like right here in Galveston.
When he does, we'll be waiting for him. Me and the boys.
This picture's buried in my head solid, like a rock.
That'll be all, Fifi.
Thank you very much.
- Don't say, "Oui, Monsieur Thomas."
- Oui, Monsieur Thomas.
Shut up, Fifi.
Ready for a little workout now?
We'll go a couple of rounds.
Let's forget it for today, Chad.
Forget it? But how you gonna relax?
I'll think of something.
I'll see you later at the office.
Sure, boss.
Oh, here.
Thanks, boss.
What about the riverboat?
Have you foreclosed yet?
I can't. The note's not due for a few weeks.
You know, something tells me you're not too happy with me.
Me? Zack, how can you say such a thing?
Oh, it's not too hard.
There was something peculiar about the stagecoach incident.
What I mean to say is that the bandits seemed rather well-informed.
Zack, what're you saying?
What I'm saying is, if anything happens to me...
...there's a brief of notes on you and your friends. Understand that?
Zack, that means you don't trust me.
On the contrary, I trust you as much as you trust me.
Nice to have seen you, Mr. Burden.
Nice to have seen you.
You know, she's right.
She is indispensable.
Strawberry!
Hey, take a look.
Yeah, how lucky!
He's a doll.
When did he get to town?
Are you sure that's him?
It's him, I tell you.
All right.
Come on, let's go!
Let's get him.
Here we are, sir.
The Congress Hotel.
- Are you sure that's him?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
All right.
If I can be of any assistance...
- I'm Prince George, at your service.
- Well, stick around. I may need you.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- The bag.
It's about time.
I've been waiting for you.
It's good to feel wanted.
Who are you?
They call me Angel.
That's not as important as who you are, Mr. Jarrett.
- You got my name. What do you want?
- To save your life. For a price.
How much?
We'll discuss it later.
You, Max and me.
They want what's in that carpetbag.
It's not in there.
- How honest are you, and who's Max?
- Do you have time to doubt me or Max?
I'll get them for you.
You got a point.
Deposit this in the bank.
- Bank?
- The money's in the lining.
Will you wait a minute?
I'll tell you when.
Here, my good man. Hold this.
I'm not your good man. He is!
Gentlemen, please.
Why, you ruffians!
Son, consider yourself temporized.
Ain't no money in this bag.
It's empty!
- What do you mean? If you're lying...
- You want to take a look? Go ahead!
The little guy. Angel.
The money must've been in Jarrett's coat. Why that...
I'll get that...
- You and that rig of yours for sale?
- We're for hire, Mr. Jarrett.
Maybe you'll make a gentleman of me.
- It would be a pleasure.
- Get the bag.
You say this fellow
Jarrett is a lawyer?
Yes, but none of us are perfect, Mr. Burden.
He seems mighty sure of himself.
You're certain he didn't...
Good morning, Mr. Wallace.
You're certain he didn't mention any government affiliations?
There are some things that Mr. Jarrett doesn't discuss with me.
You, Mr. Thomas and your partners have nothing to worry about.
- Right?
- Of course not!
Our books are always open for examination.
The people at Galveston
Savings and Trust...
...are always pleased to welcome a depositor.
Yes, I figured as much.
It's a beautiful day.
There's a smell of money in the...
There's a smell of money in the air today!
Adieu, Mr. Burden. Adieu.
Someday, little man,
I'll make you a little man.
- Now, your percentage of that...
- Just totals. I'll figure percentages.
As you wish, Mr. Thomas.
Of course.
Roulette, $1538.
What happened there?
There was trouble with one of the wheels.
You're gonna have to speak up, Alfred.
If you don't speak any louder...
...I might suspect that you're knocking down on me.
Of course, Mr. Thomas.
I'll speak loud. I'll speak real loud.
You see this laryngitis...
You'll have to speak louder.
By the way, Mr. Thomas, these books are in a terribly disoriented state.
Some of the men make their reports on Wednesdays, some on Thursdays.
By the time I get the figures and put them in the book, the system...
It's just a little off, Alfred.
- What'd you say about the roulette?
- Nothing, Mr. Thomas.
- Beat it, Alfred.
- But the figures...
Leave the book here.
You got the bag.
- Nice going, Chad.
- Thanks, boss. Yeah, I got it.
Some of it.
Some of it?
It's empty, boss.
It's empty, all right.
The law of averages caught up with you.
- You just made an accurate statement.
- Thanks, boss.
Did you search him?
Well, no, come to think of it.
The little guy, Angel...
...ran off with his pockets.
- Pockets?
I mean, with his coat.
Come in.
I've got some news that'll interest you...
...about a deposit that was made in my bank.
A large deposit.
He's smarter than I thought.
It's only for $ 75,000, though.
What do you think he did with the other $25,000?
How do I know?
All I know is it's my money.
What do you propose to do about it?
As I see it, as a banker...
...the money was deposited quite legally.
It is impossible for you or me...
...to lay a finger on it without legal action.
You understand, naturally, that such action would freeze it.
You must also understand that anything
I can do for you personally...
...I would be happy to do.
Naturally, Harvey, naturally.
But tell me, how long do you think this money will be frozen?
I wouldn't say the whole process would take more than one or...
...two years.
Forget about it.
I'll handle it myself, directly.
- Where's he staying?
- The Congress.
Tell him I'll see him in 1/2 hour at Orlando's. I'm buying.
Sure, boss.
- Buying what?
- Lunch.
Suppose he ain't hungry?
Tell him it's where the women are young and the bourbon is aged.
- He'll be there.
- Yeah, boss.
Zack, how are you gonna get that money back?
Harvey, my boy,
I wouldn't be too concerned.
I'll figure a way out.
- Right, but it's $500 short.
- That's my fee for saving your life.
$500? A life comes cheap around here.
Well, for you I made a special price.
Yes siree, and that includes fixing your coat.
The minute I saw you, I said to myself, "Angel, my boy..."
"...now he just might be the boy to do it."
Do what?
Cut Zack Thomas and his crowd down to size.
I traded my suit of armor in for a bank book, right?
If you want someone to champion your cause, you got the wrong man.
What about the riverboat?
They don't build riverboats
big enough for the two of us.
- Riverboat?
- Max is in trouble. Big trouble.
I figure a man like you, who doesn't scare so easy...
Going someplace?
Going someplace?
The fight's over. You lost.
Beat it.
Yeah, you're right.
- That's the way to handle them, boss.
- Oh, I forgot.
Mr. Thomas wants you at Orlando's in 1/2 hour.
- What's Orlando's?
- It's a restaurant. First-class.
Why meet him there?
The boss has eaten there every day for four years.
I don't think he'll change now.
Tell him I'll be there in 15 minutes. If he wants to see me...
...he'll do the same thing.
Yeah, Mr. Jarrett.
How did you like that?
With your head and my muscle, we could run this town.
Now you're talking my language.
I told you, you couldn't come in!
Mr. Harvey's having his...
I told him not to come in,
Master Harvey.
Get out.
Did Jarrett deposit the money?
Yes, but it doesn't make a difference.
It makes a difference to me.
- Now I can kill Zack Thomas.
- No, Matson.
It'll incriminate me, all of us.
We'll go to jail.
Please.
He told me he left a dossier.
- I'm fed up to here with Zack Thomas.
- Matson!
Please, Matson.
We'll see, Harvey, we'll see.
But I ain't making no promises.
In that case,
I feel obliged to warn Zack.
No, you won't warn Zack, Harvey.
Because if you do...
...l'm gonna put a bullet right into that belly!
I know you're afraid of spending a long time in jail.
But it's a whole lot better than spending a long time dying.
Aren't you gonna eat your sandwich?
- Well?
- How can I eat at a time like this?
So long, Harv.
Remember, it's a long time dying.
Shut up!
- Good day, Madame Elya.
- Good afternoon, Chester.
Mr. Thomas is inside waiting.
- Good afternoon, madame.
- Good afternoon.
How charming you look. How wonderful.
What a charming dress!
My dear.
- I came as soon as...
- We'll have two Zachariah specials.
- I'll order lunch later.
- Yes, Mr. Thomas.
I came as soon as I got your message.
But next time...
...do give me some more time.
I loathe to get dressed in a hurry.
You couldn't be more beautiful if you took three hours.
That's a compliment, I take it.
Now, darling, tell me, what is so important?
Jarrett's in town.
The man from the wanted poster?
He'll be along in a few minutes.
Elya, honey, I was wondering...
- Your drinks, Mr. Thomas.
- Thank you, Fred.
To your health, darling.
- Elya, honey, I was wondering if you...
- What were you wondering, Zack?
When you get that tone and call me "honey, Elya"...
...you're usually after something.
You are the most suspicious woman.
I was wondering if you'd be nice to him.
Nice?
How nice?
About $ 75,000 worth of nice.
Tell me, darling, this fellow Jarrett...
Is he at least attractive?
From the picture you couldn't tell what he looked like.
He needed a shave.
He couldn't look much better even with a shave.
He probably has jowls that hang to there.
Talk about bags...
...I bet he has satchels like steamer trunks under here.
Does sound funny, doesn't it?
You'll never know, darling.
Through laughing?
Let me in on the joke.
I give you a hint, Zack.
In my country, we have a saying:
"A secret whispered in a coffeehouse is as confidential as a headline."
Don't look at me so strangely, Zack.
Laugh, please.
I don't think it's funny.
My darling, this is no time to lose your sense of humor.
I've never known a problem that
Zack Thomas couldn't handle.
- No thanks, Fritz.
- Thank you, sir.
As I was saying, dear, life is much, much too short to...
- You?
- Not me. Him.
That's an awful fall he took.
I suppose you think
I should thank you.
Look out, Zack!
Fancy place for target practice.
Anybody we know?
Only too well.
If you ain't out of Galveston by sundown, you'll be real dead.
Get him out of here.
You heard Mr. Thomas.
Get him out of here.
Imagine a thing like that in a place like this.
What a mistake.
You should've shot his gun hand.
Won't make any difference.
Shoot it off, I'll still get you.
Shoot out my eyes,
I'll still find you!
Put a bullet in my heart,
I'll make a deal with the devil!
I'll trade for enough time to come back and kill you!
You hear me?
- I'm going to kill you!
- Remember to stay out.
Isn't it awful?
He's loud, isn't he?
If you ever need a friend...
...I wouldn't count on that character.
He had a darling bead centered in the middle of your forehead.
If he'd missed me an inch either way, we'd be at your darling funeral.
- Okay, that makes us even.
- Not quite.
Still a little matter of $100,000.
Yeah, now I remember.
If you'd remembered to be slower you'd be a bit richer.
Yeah, I gotta remember that for the next time.
Charming. Just charming.
Very grateful, this friend of yours.
Oh, yes. I thought you knew.
And very generous too.
Thanks for recognizing me.
You knew he was there all the time?
- I'm sorry, Zack. I couldn't resist.
- I'm glad you didn't.
- Would you like to join us?
- Gentlemen, excuse me.
I don't feel quite up to a chatty little lunch.
- You have things to talk about.
- That's right, we have.
I'm sorry I can't lend a hand at the moment. Perhaps later.
In fact, it will be a pleasure.
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Au revoir, gentlemen.
Good afternoon.
- Let's get down to business.
- I drink much better standing.
- Lead on. I'll follow.
- You'll understand if I get my hat?
You won't need it, but I'll understand.
- Brandy.
- Yes, Mr. Thomas.
Mr. Jarrett, how many states would you say you're wanted in?
- How many states are there?
- I could get you a pardon in Texas.
- For how much?
I give you $100,000, and you'll get me a pardon?
In most states,
I could buy a pardon for $5000...
...as well as a governor.
- You're thinking of Rhode Island.
This here's Texas.
And here, your life goes with it.
Now, I'd be no good to you dead.
The money would go to my heirs.
Wife?
Well, not exactly. It's like an old friend. A good friend.
- And, well, then there are kids.
- Kids?
All 25 of them.
Twenty-five?
You must have the fastest horse in Texas.
Have more of this to keep your strength up.
- Zack!
- I was just coming to see you.
- I know, but please, l...
- This is Jarrett.
This is Joe Jarrett?
Why, drinking like friends.
Zack, may I see you in private?
That's fine. I was on my way to draw out some of my money from your bank.
- Matson tried to kill me.
- I had nothing to do with it.
- I swear on my sacred word of honor.
- On your what?
I believed you about that dossier...
...and I have loyalty to my board.
I don't know what Matson was thinking.
I told him this was no time to...
I'm not putting a bullet...
...in your big fat head because I might need you.
But I may not need you for long.
Sweet blackberries!
Shrimp!
Clams!
Get your crawfish right off the shrimp boat!
Strawberries!
How does it look to you?
Man, if somebody's looking for splinters, this is the place.
There's something about that old boat, Mr. Jarrett.
I won't believe it until
I see Noah come off of that deck.
This is really a fine boat.
A little paint...
...to fix her up and she'd be ready...
- Ready to fall apart.
You should announce yourself.
If I gave a real loud yell...
...the vibration would cause this tub to collapse.
You better duck.
- The hat isn't worth anything.
- It means money in the bank.
I've never ducked from anybody in my life.
Do that again,
I'll shoot through your water line.
- Duck! You don't know Max.
- The unknown don't scare me.
Christopher Columbus' blood flows through my veins.
Are you all right, Mr. Jarrett?
I remembered
Christopher couldn't swim.
Don't worry, I'll get you out.
Max, hold it!
Angel, throw him that life preserver.
We'll get you out in a jiffy.
I wanted to wait until Saturday to take a bath.
Here!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You trying to save me or sink me?
Over your head. That's it.
Here, George!
Hold onto this belt.
You're doing fine.
You're just a bit wet, that's all.
Fine Southern hospitality.
Invite me to buy a boat...
...and you try to drown me.
Right, you're looking great.
Just a little wet, that's all.
There you are.
Come down here to help a friend.
What do they do? They...
- It's still a fine boat.
- I'm sorry, Max didn't mean nothing.
When Max does mean something,
I hope I'm not around.
Wait till you meet Max, though.
Oh, you're gonna...
Boy, oh, boy!
Max, meet Mr. Jarrett.
Mr. Jarrett, Maxine Richter.
Howdy, ma'am.
An unwritten law of the sea says
I must make you welcome.
- Come aboard.
- Yes, ma'am.
The firing must have been a 21 -gun salute.
By the way, which unwritten law do I come under?
The law of hospitality to a man overboard.
I'm not overboard yet.
Not quite yet, but I will admit just a little push might do it.
- Max.
- Why do you come here?
- He wants to help you, Miss Maxie.
- By looking at me that way?
Well, don't let the inflamed eyes fool you.
I always look like that when I go swimming.
Max is as gentle as a kitten, when you get to know her.
Being welcomed, can I get out from under the rifle and into dry clothes?
Come inside. You can change in my cabin.
- What? It's an unwritten law.
- An unwritten law.
That's right.
Unwritten law.
- My glass is empty.
- Coming, Joe.
Who belongs to this kimono?
- My husband.
- Your husband?
He was shot dead in a poker game last year.
Too bad.
- A professional gambler?
- Not professional enough, apparently.
Now you're looking for somebody to provide you with security. Right?
The boat is my security.
I'm looking for a deal.
If somebody wanted to fix it up as a casino, for instance...
...I would be interested in any proposition.
I like the service here.
I could make you a proposition.
Good.
- I have a couple of questions for you.
- You go right ahead.
I want to be totally clear. I have no complaints about the hospitality.
- You have been pleased?
- Yes. It was a pleasure being aboard.
But I was just wondering about a few little details.
Why did you take those shots at me?
The men here think a European woman is available, just like so.
But the shots were a warning.
I can be approached...
...but on my own terms.
- I see. Courtship, European-style.
I like it, except the first few minutes.
I wasn't trying to hit you. It was...
...how you say, a come-along.
- "Come-along"? A come-on?
- A come-on.
A 30-caliber come-on. What was with the crockery and the slap in the face?
Is that more of that maidenly resistance?
No. That was for the benefit of the hired help.
- A girl's got her reputation.
- Not my reputation, yours.
Those two will serve you better if they think you are masterful.
I think I'm being used.
No. You're not being used, you're being served.
I'm being served?
But why me? Why was I elected?
Why not Zachary Thomas, for instance?
I was giving him the come-along too.
Then Angel told me you got the money.
Fortunately, I like honesty in a partner. All right, honey.
I'll throw in the money.
Have it fixed up.
We'll be equal partners.
- Equal partners will not work.
- I don't take orders too good.
But I do. You will give the orders.
You will be the master.
I give the orders?
All right. Make that new.
Go on. Another drink.
Yes, sir.
What I don't understand about European women is...
...why you want me to be lord and master when I...
...offered you a partnership?
- It's my training, Joe.
How things should be between a man and a woman.
A man as a partner, I don't understand. But a master...
A master, him I know how to handle.
Don't go away, Max.
I just thought of another order.
- We're in business.
- Maybe we're in business.
I never saw a lady barber before.
- Are there barber schools for ladies?
- No, I learned as a girl.
I remember Mama went after Papa with a razor a few times.
Zack, why are you letting them fix up that old tub?
Why would a lady of your breeding and background...
...want to be a barber?
- The money.
At the moment it's all under his name in your bank.
- How am I gonna get ahold of it?
- Breeding is acquired.
By legal action.
- Being a barber gives you breeding?
- But that would take time.
I thought I'd try to sabotage his effort to renovate.
Do you think this fellow would discourage easily?
No.
When we're done, they'll be glad to sell the boat for $ 7.12.
- All right, next. Name?
- Mancini. Pete Mancini.
Pete Mancini.
All right, next.
- Name?
- Fred Welsh.
In the saloon, Mancini.
Max'll give you the uniform.
- No guns.
- What if there's any trouble?
Clubs, hammers, fists, feet.
Anything but guns. Now move it.
- Next.
- Five more men, Mr. Jarrett.
- All right, bring 'em on down.
- Come on.
No. You must look as though you were born to it.
I was born to an alcoholic daddy who liked all the dollies.
I figure Daddy was right.
Go find your alcohol and your dollies somewhere else. Now get out!
All right.
What would your daddy say to that?
Why you...
Joe!
All right, get rid of him.
Tell Zack I got his message and I'll deliver his reply personally.
Oh, men!
Anybody else with comments on what they like or not?
- Can I see you for a moment?
- Sure. Why not?
Why are you going ashore to see Zack Thomas?
Every square inch of paint we scraped around here...
...Zack feels like it's coming off his hide.
He sent him to start trouble.
He sends one stupid little man to slow us down?
He paid that man to insult me...
...so you'd go into Zack's territory with that red in your eye.
If that was his plan, it worked.
Do you have any reason to think
I admire Zack Thomas?
You gave him the old come-along.
I heard you been shooting a lot of ammunition to flirt with Casanova.
Don't shoot at him again.
If you raise the rifle at other men,
I'll break it over your pretty skull.
Joe, there is no reason to be jealous.
All right, so I gave Zack Thomas a little come-along.
But, Joe, I didn't let him come aboard.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Trowbridge.
- Good afternoon, Williams.
- Good afternoon, Madame Trowbridge.
- Good afternoon.
- Madame Elya will be with you soon.
- Thank you.
Isn't it lucky?
Now we both got fellows.
Of our own.
- Shall we
- Yes, we shall.
It's showtime, Mr. Jarrett.
- I could've outfitted an army by now.
- Not this kind of army, Boss.
We are ready, monsieur.
- That is gorgeous.
- Would you care to sit here?
Beautiful.
How do you like it?
Just ease it across the hips a little and bring up the neckline.
I understand how it is when one contemplates marriage.
Marriage? Marriage is for married people.
Now that you're serious, you're already acting like a husband.
I am definitely not a husband and I never intend to become one.
Marriage has nothing to do with it.
It's all right if she wants to go...
In the altogether, Joe?
Put it any way you want...
If you show them everything, they may not come back.
That's part of it.
- Good afternoon, Zack.
- Elya, you look absolutely charming.
You've succeeded in gilding the lily.
And that's some lily-gilding.
If you will excuse me, I have so many other lilies to gild.
- May I, Bill?
- Yes, sir.
- When are you planning to open?
- When the workmen are finished.
That's too bad.
We hardly know each other.
There's hardly been time with all your other interests and... activities.
That's true. We've all been very busy in our own little way.
Madame. Joe.
May the best man win.
- So far there's no contest.
- So far.
- The game isn't over yet.
- Right.
I hear the northwest docks might be condemned.
What does he mean, Joe?
He means our customers can't cross the docks to get to the boat.
- Not cross the docks?
- And it's a shame, too, isn't it?
After spending all of that nice money.
- But there are other docks.
- Yes, there are other docks.
But they're all controlled by
Mr. Harvey Burden. Right?
Your grasp of the situation is precise.
Too bad because there isn't another berth in Galveston.
- I think you might be interested.
- Thank you, Bill.
You'll excuse me.
See you later, darling.
Yes, of course.
- Shall we?
- We shall.
Boss, take a look.
"Consigned and insured by
Mr. Zack Thomas."
So it's an insurance job?
Find out if there are any survivors.
- It says that all are lost.
- Lf I'm right, there's one survivor.
The one who got paid to pull the plug.
- You go find him.
- Leave it to me. I'll find him.
One gross lot lavender smelling salts,
Ladies' saloon?
That's a mistake. It should have been "salon," not "saloon."
I'm not so sure.
With these prices, it'd be cheaper to drink.
Do me a favor, Max? Will you get me some coffee? Black. Strong.
- Joe?
- Yeah?
- How do you like my new neglig閑?
- It's fine. You look good in anything.
Max, will you get me the coffee please?
The galley's so far away and the fire is probably out.
- I have some brandy in my cabin.
- Yes, sure.
I want coffee.
She wants brandy.
Women. You can see right through them!
I didn't remodel a boat,
I bought a fleet!
Do you mind spending money for things you really want?
Not if it's something
I really want. What's money?
I'm glad you feel that way. Men who worry about little things bore me.
Brandy?
Perhaps you prefer to have something else?
Oh, no, this is fine.
No, it's fine.
Oh, poor Joe, you were so thirsty.
You didn't notice what I'm wearing.
- You're wearing something?
- Lf you don't like it...
No. Dear, there's a draft out there.
You can sit down here.
You can catch a cold.
- I like men who worry about me.
- Don't worry. I'm a great worrier.
Sometimes I worry for months on end.
After this afternoon, you might think my gown is too revealing.
Do you think my gown is too revealing?
No. Too many clothes, you get overheated. It's unhealthy.
But earlier, at Madame Elya's, you said they were too revealing.
Oh, I must have been crazy.
Perhaps you feel like most
American men do.
I don't feel any less.
I guarantee you that.
Most American men pretend to dislike in public what they prefer in private.
I'm not into crowds. But if you want audience, you go to a saloon.
How do you feel about marriage, Joe?
Fine, but who'd have us?
Oh, no, Max. You're not thinking about marriage?
Of course not. Why should I think about marriage?
That's why I like you, Max. You got brains. You think like a man.
I'm glad, Joe. Then it doesn't bother you that I'm a woman?
With what you got on, I'd be in trouble if you were a man.
After the boat opens and you're a success, what'll you do then, Joe?
- Count money.
- It can't be very much fun alone.
There'd be you and me.
- Just the two of us?
- You're talking about a crowd again.
It might be less drafty in my cabin, Joe.
- I'll go close the windows.
- The windows are already closed.
- I'll go open them. It's healthier.
- Will you do it for me, Joe?
- Open the windows in my cabin?
- Oh, come on, Max.
If I go to that cabin, we know what's gonna happen.
You'll be thinking about marriage again.
But I think like a man, Joe.
- You said so.
- You don't look like a man.
- Please, Joe.
- No.
- Joe, please?
- No!
Please, Joe.
I'll be in here, Joe.
I'll wait for you.
- Please, Joe.
- No.
Joe, please.
Why should I be strong?
I found him! Me, Angel.
The sole survivor of the Spindrift.
- The Spindrift?
- Come. I'll take you to him. Let's go!
- Well, you're coming?
- I'm coming.
Oh, men!
- What was that?
- The wind.
There's a hell of a storm coming up.
- Hey, then what's that?
- The storm's getting worse.
Mr. Burden hired me to scuttle the Spindrift.
- Burden? With or without cotton?
- Without.
Burden made a deal with a broker, insured the cotton...
...then we left it on the dock and sailed out empty.
Couple of days later I scuttled the boat. Came back here.
To collect from Burden.
I collected all right.
A full load in the guts.
I better get him out of here, Mr. Jarrett.
He won't be much of a witness without that hole plugged up.
Looks like our witness just ran out on us.
As far as anyone knows he's still alive and ready to talk.
Where are they?
- In your office.
- My office? Why my office?
They said it'd be all right.
Come right in. Make yourself at home. We've been waiting for you.
So I see.
Real cozy place you got here, Mr. Burden.
Sit down, Mr. Burden.
Mr. Jarrett wishes to talk to you.
Last night we talked with the owner of that hat.
You couldn't have.
There weren't any survivors.
- Crew's all dead.
- All dead? Not this one.
He's on his way to north Texas, where he'll be safe.
If you want us to send for him and bring him back...
I don't understand you, Harvey.
He just plain blackmailed you.
Why did you sign the lease?
Zack, please. I told you I signed impulsively to... to protect you.
- I was afraid they would hang you.
- Hang me?
Don't be ridiculous! I wouldn't touch a false insurance claim.
Let alone scuttle a ship and murder 35 men!
- What gave you the idea he had a case?
- I don't know.
What're we gonna do about Jarrett and his gambling boat?
You don't leave me much choice.
He now has the dock rights.
But don't worry.
Opening night will be closing night.
I hope so.
I sometimes feel I don't have the intestinal fortitude for this job.
I think guts is the word, Harv.
What you don't have is guts.
That could well be.
I expect to see you and the missis at the opening.
We wouldn't want Jarrett to think we forgot our manners, would we?
No, I guess not.
Good morning,
Madame Carlson.
What's bothering him?
Harvey's not thrilled about going to the opening.
You're not allowing them to open that ridiculous boat?
Them or they may be just a lot brighter than all of us.
And another thing.
You are going to the opening.
Don't bother to ask any questions, because I want you to go.
- Any other questions?
- No other questions.
Zack!
- I love you.
- Sure you do, sweetheart.
- And I love you too.
- I didn't mean it that way.
- No? How did you mean it?
- I want to get married.
- Is that all?
- Is there more?
Frankly, there's much more.
Like the question of your happiness.
Right now you're well taken care of. Secure.
But suppose I said yes.
And then I went out there and they...
Let me put it this way. A gambler's not a very good insurance risk.
And the people who disturb me most at funerals are the women.
Especially widows.
But the sight of you in sackcloth is something more than I bargained for.
Then you do love me? Please quit.
Before they kill you.
If they do, you'll be busy whipping up a mourning outfit and forget about me.
- Zack!
- What?
Kiss me?
Kissing you is always a pleasure, darling.
There she is. All done.
I think she looks pretty damn good.
She looks beautiful.
Joseph, I'm really proud of you.
You did a wonderful job.
Our boat. It looks fantastic.
Not me, Max, us. All of us made our boat look fantastic.
- Want me to try, Mr. Jarrett?
- Let her blow!
Lower to the left.
- All right?
- Perfect. Now nail it on.
Gentlemen, please be our guest.
I name you La Maison Rouge.
Here is to all of you hardworking gentlemen who made this possible.
If you have any wages burning a hole...
...in your pocket, you know where to go.
- Captain, who pays the two dollars?
- What two dollars?
Easy with the picture.
Be serious, we gotta find out who this picture belongs to.
You must be Miss Maxine.
The storage company sent us to deliver your picture.
- What makes you so sure it's hers?
- It's her all right.
Are you kidding?
Come take a look.
You guys recede.
- She really posed for that?
- Yes, that's me.
Yeah.
- I wonder if he did it from memory.
- Yeah, that's her.
- I wish my wife looked like that.
- Yeah.
This was all my husband left me.
He was a connoisseur of art.
Shame he didn't leave you clothes to go with it.
- Who pays the two dollars?
- As soon as you hang it over the bar.
- Up the gangplank, to the starboard.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Starboard is to the right.
- That's where I'm going.
When I say go, we'll point to the right.
Go!
I'll do it so even you can understand.
Now go!
- Curly Joe.
- What?
- He's a nitwit.
- He's stupid.
Now when I say "go" we'll all point to the right. Go!
Now he's stupid.
Captain, help me out? I'm dealing with two mental midgets.
When I say "go" we'll all point to the right. Go!
- Go!
- There they are!
There they are!
Now wait a minute.
Stop beating up on me!
Leave her alone.
She reminds me of my mother.
We didn't mean any harm.
- I told you.
- You never had a mother.
- Shame on you.
- Remind me to have you stuffed.
That picture is a disgrace to Galveston.
You won't hang that disgraceful picture.
Get your mother out of here, Whistler!
Get her in that chair.
Take it easy.
She'll be all right.
- Don't worry, Mildred.
- Is she all right?
- These wheelchairs are dangerous.
- Are you all right?
Yes. You'll be all right.
Just a minute.
You struck one of the toughest men from Texas. Tell her, Tex.
- Oh, did I?
- Maybe you don't understand.
He's the toughest man from Texas. Give her an adjective.
Wait a minute.
It couldn't be better if we planned it.
- How so?
- It's the oldest military tactic.
Keep the enemy fighting among themselves.
Let them fight. Let them beat each other to a pulp.
Then we'll move in on Mr. Jarrett and Mr. Thomas with 200 men.
Fresh men.
And here's the man
I've taken care of...
...and nurtured to be the leader of our gladiators.
Gentlemen, an old friend of yours.
Why, it's Matson.
That's right, gentlemen. Mr. Matson.
Wonder when he got back.
- He looks fully recovered.
- He sure does.
- Can he still use his gun hand?
- Matson, tell the gentlemen...
...how carefully we planned our skirmish.
What signal do I give when I'm on the boat...
...and you're waiting with your men?
Jarrett will use the boat whistle when Zack attacks...
...and when you want me, just double that signal.
Simple.
This may just prove to be one of the bloodiest arenas in history.
Gentlemen, tonight's opening would not be possible...
...without your help.
Keep in mind this is LA Maison Rouge not the Last Chance Saloon...
...and this will be a memorable night for Galveston...
...and a profitable one for us.
Be on your best behavior.
It's very simple.
When in doubt, just smile.
If you're in doubt, call on Renee.
Renee has been appointed maitre
d'h魌el. That means "headwaiter."
You all know what to do.
Mr. Jarrett would like to say a few words.
Remember one thing. No rough stuff unless you hear the whistle.
If it looks like trouble with uninvited visitors...
...Angel will give two blasts on the pipe. Right?
- Right.
- Then you go all out.
We must catch them at the dock.
Have you got that straight?
Good luck to all of us.
Wait for the customers?
Do you really think there will be any?
If nothing else brings them out, that dress will.
- You like it?
- Sure. I paid for it!
They're coming, Mr. Jarrett!
All right, men. Places.
I guess we all understand that?
Look at all them pigeons.
Don't shoot until the green on their money shows.
- Here we go, Prince George.
- Yes, sir!
All right, the show is on.
Isn't this wonderful, Henry?
This Jarrett's a clever fellow.!
So that's the notorious
Maxine Richter.
Max, to her friends.
Do you think Zack Thomas will let
Jarrett get away with it?
I see we are honored by some of the oldest families in Galveston.
And by some of the youngest wives.
Mr. And Mrs. Winthrop Trowbridge.
Mr. And Mrs. Harvey Burden!
- Good evening.
- Mr. Jarrett.
It's a pleasure to welcome you both.
- Mr. Burden.
- We're having more fun.
Very gratifying.
Very gratifying indeed.
Come along, Evelyn.
I see some friends.
Deal, deal, deal.
Pay 18.
Thank you.
- Credit these to my account.
- Yes, Mr. Godfrey.
Ladies, shall we?
How about that?
That's right, Arthur Godfrey.
Presenting Madame Elya Carlson!
- Stop staring, William.
- Who's staring?
What an entrance. Look at those diamonds. They look real.
- Quite a sight, Max?
- Lf you like the type.
Oh, it takes all kinds...
If Elya's here, then Zachariah can't be far behind.
Hey, Boss.
Boss.
They're here, they're here.
Well, come on.
Mr. And Mrs. Jacques Byrnes.
- You be ready when I tell you.
- You bet.
Maestro, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please?
Miss Maxine will say a few words.
Ladies and gentlemen, some visitors are about to drop in unexpectedly.
Mr. Jarrett will meet them on the dock and explain that we are full.
It might take some convincing.
But no one here will be harmed.
In the meantime, have fun.
We have spared no expense to make
La Maison Rouge...
...your pleasure home away from home.
And if you'll just continue to enjoy yourself...
...Mr. Jarrett will rejoin us shortly.
Please, be our guests, drink up.
Maestro.
Men, let's go.
Come on. Hustle it up.
Everybody, let's go.
Oh, it's Zack Thomas.
Men, get into position.
- I hope Jarrett knows what he's doing.
- Just like we planned it.
Shape up, boys. Shape up.
Don't start anything unless Mr. Jarrett says so.
Good evening.
You have a reservation?
This boat was my idea.
We're taking over as of now.
This is opening night.
By the time your men and my men...
...figure out who's taking over, nothing will be left.
If the boat is wrecked and a customer gets hurt...
You mean there'll be no more gold mine. What do you suggest?
I don't like to louse up a new sporting jacket, but...
...maybe you and I could settle this between us. Winner take all.
I got more men.
You're trying to even up the odds.
Maybe you were man enough to bet on yourself for a change.
Want to show off, huh?
And you don't, huh?
Well, how about it?
Don't look for no favors, Joe.
- Don't let him get away with that!
- That's just not cricket.
I said, don't look for no favors.
The one who's on his feet when this is over wins it all.
Everything? Gift-wrapped, everything. Winner take all.
Everybody out of it.
Just Zack and me.
Everybody out.
All of you.
And you too, and you too.
Hold it!
Stay here until we hear that whistle.
You three, and you three, stay with me.
Wait a minute!
You heard what he said.
We'll wait and see who'll come out upright!
- What did you say?
- I said upright!
Hold it.
Hold, hold.
That dirty rat Burden!
I know why he wouldn't give you access to this dock!
He let the Spindrift sail empty and then scuttled it.
He probably intends to sell me my own cotton.
Nice reliable fellow to do business with.
I won't hand you Galveston on a silver platter. You'll have to take it.
- Come on in, Max.
- I won't go for that old joke.
No, Zack.
I really didn't think you would.
Now, this fight has rules.
I'm here to break the rules.
Why not?
You got the gun.
All right, let's go.
Remember!
Zack Thomas belongs to me.
Well, if I have to die...
...I prefer being killed by the hand of a beautiful woman.
If you're not careful, my darling, you might have your wish.
Honey!
Not yet.
Grown men acting like little schoolboys.
I suggest you both become partners in everything, including cotton.
I don't like partners.
Hey, boss!
They're coming.
Harvey Burden's men.
Matson is leading them!
How many?
- About a couple of thousand.
- How many?
At least 200.
Partners?
- Partners.
- Welcome, partner.
Partners.
All right, listen to me.
Jarrett and I are partners.
That puts us all together.
Let's deploy and protect the boat.
Come on, ladies.
Andiamo, andiamo.
What's the matter with you?
You heard him. You and I'll fight together now, Chad.
- Against who?
- Against them, that's who!
That don't seem right, fighting together. Why?
Why? Because they are the bad guys, that's why!
- Ain't we the bad guys?
- No, we're the good guys!
Let's go!
- I'm frightened, Sam.
- We'll stay and see the fun.
Ladies, everything'll turn out fine.
He's got an army with him.
Don't be afraid to use them torches.
- This'll be some bonfire.
- Get set, men. Get ready, come on.
All right, let's go.
Don't let those rats on the boat.
Watch the torches, they may try to burn it down.
All right, let's get them.
My eyes!
Keep them off the boat!
I'll take care of them, boss.
You ain't taking care of me.
- Looking for somebody?
- Matson...
...I feel better when I know what he's doing.
Me too!
Get that daring young man.
- Seen Matson?
- Not yet.
I've been thinking.
You're liable to blow Burden up, too.
He wants this boat blown up.
I can't help it if he's on board.
Don't think.
Wait for me, you understand?
It's Matson.
Up there on the wheel.
All right, Mr. Matson.
It's your deal.
Looks like the water's on fire.
Because he's arranging that deal with the devil.
I'm laying eight to five he doesn't make it back.
Come along with us,
Mr. Burden.
The U.S. Marshal would like to see you.
Some misunderstanding about the Spindrift.
Probably nothing at all.
- Harv!
- Don't call me "Harv"!
Ready.
You're going to treasure this picture.
And you're lucky to have married two such lovely, innocent girls.
- Don't tell me how to spell!
- I was only trying to help.
I know how to spell!
With four for Texas in the mood...
...they'll have themselves a real fine brood.
- Like me?
- Yes, like you.
Good guys always get married
and live happily ever after.
If it don't turn out too good,
Zack and me figure we can light out.
And, oh yeah,
this is the end.
WHERE LIFE HAD NO VALUE,
DEATH, SOMETIMES, HAD ITS PRICE.
THAT IS WHY THE
BOUNTY KILLERS APPEARED.
Tickets.
Tickets, please.
Tickets. Tickets.
Thank you. Tickets.
Is it far to Tucumcari?
We should pass there in about three or four minutes.
Thanks.
Excuse me, but you've made a mistake, Reverend.
I couldn't help hearing you're going to Tucumcari.
I peddle goods around here, and I better tell you you're on the wrong train.
I think the nearest stop to Tucumcari is Amarillo.
By getting off at Santa Fe and returning by way of Amarillo, you should be able to get right where you're going.
You see, the train doesn't stop at Tucumcari.
This train'll stop at Tucumcari.
Take it easy, everybody!
Why'd you stop?
Something's gone wrong?
Somebody pulled the emergency cord.
Hey, mister, you just can't pull the emergency cord and jump off.
Tell me, why'd you stop that train?
If you want to get off, you...
Well, the rail road company would be mighty pleased to make any arrangements for any passenger if you want to get off here, sir.
I did get off. Thanks.
All right, let's go!
Go ahead! Let's go!
Guy passed by here in person and added on those two zeros.
He was spitting mad when he saw what they was offering.
He wasn't flattered.
He said, "A measly 1,000 bucks for me is much too little.
"I'm worth a lot more than that."
That's right. He said that, and then he added the zeros on the 1,000.
There isn't anyone got the guts to face that killer, eh?
At least it's been that way till now.
Where is he?
Where is he?
I have no idea where he'd be today.
- Hold still.
- But, Guy...
Hold still,
I said.
You hurt me with those hands of yours.
Then do as I tell you.
Stop it!
Now see, you've made me drop the soap.
Wait, I'll get it for you.
Oh, you're killing me.
Oh, look. What's that?
Pardon me, ma'am.
I'll kill you for this.
There you are. $1,000.
What do you know about Cavanagh?
About a week ago he was seen at White Rocks.
Thanks.
If it's of any interest to you, somebody else dropped in to see me about him.
Who?
I'd never seen him before.
His name is Monco.
Light?
You know Baby Cavanagh?
Now tell me, you know where I can find him?
There, at that table.
He's got his back to you.
Thanks.
Two cards.
Didn't hear what the bet was.
Your life.
Alive or dead, it's your choice.
Let Red go.
It's a lot of money.
Takes me three years to earn it.
Tell me, isn't a sheriff supposed to be courageous, loyal, and above all, honest?
Yeah, that he is.
I think you people need a new sheriff.
Yuri.
Hasta luego.
Amigo
How are you, Nino?
Better when I see you.
Go on. Go ahead.
Open it.
What's up?
Who is it?
Rodriquez, señor.
You, come along.
I'm letting you live, hero.
That's so you can tell everybody you've seen what takes place here.
For the lousy money.
No. No, no.
You took money to put me behind bars.
You should've killed me when you could.
It would be better for you.
And for them.
How old is the boy?
How old is the boy,
I asked?
He's 18 months now.
Just the time that I was in jail.
You used the reward that you got...
Oh, no, no.
...To start raising a family.
And that's why I feel your family is partly mine.
I'll take my part now.
Outside.
They're both innocent.
Please let them go.
I was the one.
You know that.
Oh, no.
No!
I know.
I'm sure you hate me just enough.
This time you'll have a chance to shoot me, but not in the back.
Let go.
When you hear the music finish, begin.
Or do you think you can?
Let's start.
Now.
Check those figures again.
Yes, sir.
Good day, sir.
Good afternoon.
Mortimer.
Douglas Mortimer.
Mortimer. Virginia, isn't it?
Carolina.
That's right,
Carolina.
Can I help in some way?
I'm looking for a first-class bank.
Oh, but exactly.
Yeah.
The largest and most secure bank in the territory.
Well, Mr. Mortimer,
I want to assure you our bank here has everything, all the safeguards you're looking for.
I don't doubt that, but I have a large sum to deposit.
Now, suppose I'm a bandit.
A bandit?
A very dangerous bandit with a gang of killers.
Now what would be the most impossible bank for me to rob?
In your case, the one bank I would suggest is the Bank of El Paso.
Not even Indio would dare to attack that one.
It's not a bank.
It's a fortress there.
What time's the next train for El Paso?
I'll telegraph to my colleague in the Bank of El Paso that you're going to arrive.
Thanks.
Hey, mister. Captain.
General. Welcome.
Do you need a stable or a room?
Do you want to take a bath?
My name is Fernando.
The stable is right here.
And that is your hotel.
Why this hotel and not some other?
You probably wouldn't like that other place as much, señor
You'd have to spend half the night shooting cockroaches.
At this hotel, the rooms will cost you so much less.
And there's a landlady at this one, señor.
Married?
Yes, but she doesn't care.
That's the bank. As soon as I get some money, I'll put it in.
Well, you're gonna have to earn it first.
I have 50 cents here for you if you'll let me know when anybody you've never seen before here in El Paso comes to town.
At the hotel, señor.
A stranger just came out of there.
Where's he staying?
The hotel.
Let me know if you see any more strangers.
Sure, señor.
Help you, sir?
I want the room right above.
I'm sorry, it's occupied.
It's too bad.
The hotel's filled to capacity.
I'm sorry. The room you want is our best.
It's always occupied.
By who?
Check the register.
Mary!
It's Señor Martinez.
It's free now.
That room is taken!
I'll see to it.
He's nothing but a wild, vicious animal.
He's tall, isn't he?
You're just dirty!
Proprietor, quick! My bill!
I Want my bill!
Before he comes down here, give me my bill.
Oh, no.
There's no need to check out.
I assure you, everything's gonna be all right, Mr. Martinez.
I'll give you another room immediately.
It's the best in the whole hotel, the best. No.
We'll let him have the bridal suite.
No, no, Mary, the bill.
I'd like to stay, only I can't.
Don't go,
Mr. Martinez.
I have an appointment elsewhere.
Señor Martinez.
Yes, señor.
What do you want?
I don't wear them.
I'm honored that you thought of me.
Thank you.
Watch this.
Hello, my friends.
Hello, Indio.
You see, I didn't waste a minute coming here.
Indio calls and Groggy comes running right away.
And Sancho?
If you're waiting for Sancho, I'll go and come back in about four years.
He's in prison for four years.
No amor. No dinero. No sun.
Bad for him.
Not so bad for the rest of us.
A man who gets caught doesn't deserve respect, huh?
What's it all about, huh?
Now just listen
A bank at El Paso.
Let's see.
We'll say this is the inside of the bank.
Nino is the safe.
Which weighs three tons and can't be opened with dynamite.
There's the part with two cashiers.
This is the manager's desk.
Right in back is a fancy cabinet containing bottles for offering drinks to the rich depositors.
There's the main door, and opposite they built a double wall.
What happens, Groggy?
Let's say you've already killed the two cashiers and the manager.
And for the next few minutes, you're the boss of the bank.
Now what?
The time's been wasted, Indio.
Right, a waste of time.
Especially, Groggy, to blast open that damn iron safe.
We'd have to be using so much dynamite that the whole bank would just disappear.
And you'd all go up with it.
And besides, the presence of a safe alone doesn't always signify that there is money inside.
To help you understand what I mean,
I would like to relate a nice little parable.
Once upon a time there was a carpenter.
You don't think a carpenter can make money, eh?
No? You're wrong.
This one did well because he was a builder of safes.
There was a banker once who decided he must have his iron safe disguised to look like a wood cabinet.
To get it made the banker goes to our carpenter for the job, and one day, as destiny has it, the carpenter's in El Paso.
He happens to walk into the bank there, and what does he find?
The cabinet.
Since he'd worked on the cabinet, he spotted it right away.
From that day on, he couldn't work any more.
Pity, because there was something he had to do.
There was this crazy idea.
And it stayed.
And it stayed.
To put his hands on the money inside.
Get in there and grab all the money.
Sure, you think that carpenter was lucky the way things work out.
That he was lucky to go in just that bank.
It wasn't true.
His good fortune stopped that day.
Because later, as a prisoner, he ran into me.
The carpenter told me the story, and I tell you.
The money isn't in the safe.
It's right in this.
Almost a million dollars in it.
Your colleague in
Tucumcari told me that this bank has the largest deposits in the whole state.
Yes, that's correct,
Mr. Mortimer.
Here at the bank at El Paso we have half a million dollars reserve on hand.
I see.
You sure this bank is secure enough to hold that much?
From the moment your money's on deposit here, Mr. Mortimer, you can sleep without any worries.
Besides, when the bank is closed, an armed guard always remains here and a patrol is on guard outside.
Even the Bank of San Francisco isn't that well protected.
Exactly.
The truth is, Mr. Mortimer, to try robbing us would be so futile that only a complete fool would attempt it.
Yeah.
Or a complete madman.
Get out of the way!
Get out of here!
More news, amigo.
Another stranger in town?
Yes. And I know something else.
There was another stranger
I didn't tell you about.
Listen to me, you sawed-off little runt!
I want to know how many men there are all together.
Well, there were two.
Now there's two more.
Where?
In the saloon.
Whiskey.
Listen, mister, why do you choose my place to commit suicide?
I know that man.
It's a miracle you're alive.
Why should a man walk around with a pistol and then let himself be insulted?
It's mighty strange.
Sir, if the hunchback didn't shoot you, he had a very, very important reason, that's all.
I was thinking that myself. now 4... now 5...
6... 7... 8...
9... 10...
32 and 33.
No. No, no.
All right, now.
I don't know him! I don't know him!
I don't know him!
Come on, now, you know everybody.
I don't know anybody any more!
I'm dead! Understand?
Well, there was a time when I knew everybody.
That was a long time ago when all this was prairie.
But in these days, everybody's in a hurry.
That's right, with your damned good-for-nothing trains!
Your damn trains!
Toot-toot-toot-twee!
Disgusting!
One day, someone from the rail road comes here to see me.
And he says, "Prophet, the railway's gonna go right past your house."
"Is that so?" I said.
"Mmm-hmm.
Yep, that right," he says.
"All those trains gonna go right past here."
"And the best thing for you, Prophet, is to sell your land to the company,"
"or else we'll buy Baker's."
"He lives next to your place,"
"and I'll put the tracks there and that'll make you go crazy."
"What do you say?
Will you sell out to our company, Prophet?"
"Oh, is that so?" says I.
He was very anxious for me to sell out.
You know what I told him about the rail road?
You know what I told him he could do with his rail road?
You know what my decision about selling was?
Well, you said no.
You're right about that.
No to him and his damn trains.
I wouldn't! No!
Look, listen to me, old man.
You're supposed to be a prophet.
I didn't come here to listen to you rattle on about trains.
I wanted to find out about this man.
It's obvious you don't know anything.
No need to be insulting.
If that's all you came here to do, you can clear out of my house fast before I lose my temper. Understand?
Hey! Where you going?
I guess I better leave before you go and lose your temper.
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so dang stupid?
Hurry up.
Give me that pistol there.
Yeah, right there behind you.
Hurry!
Yes, yes, that's the one.
Now, hand it over.
That's it. Give me that gun.
The man you asked about.
There's only one question, how does he carry his gun?
He wears it here, across his belly?
Yeah.
Well, why didn't you tell me that in the first place, my boy?
Of course I know the man you're trying to find out about.
Of course I know him.
He's Colonel Douglas Mortimer.
Mortimer, a brave man, a soldier.
He was known as the best shot in the Carolinas.
A great soldier.
Now he's reduced to being a bounty killer, same as you.
Because of trains.
Because of the damn trains!
Damn them!
Take it to the station.
The gentleman's leaving.
Hold it.
Take it back.
Take it to the station.
Go inside.
The station.
Just like the games we know.
He's picking it up.
A trick, maybe.
How can somebody in my business go around with a contraption like this?
That contraption almost sent you to your grave.
You're forgetting one thing, Colonel,
I was shooting at your hat.
Well, I was only shooting at yours.
But I recall firing first.
Boy,
I've reached almost 50 years of age with my system.
Not many men last long in these parts.
How long do you expect to last?
Much longer than that.
When I get my hands on
Indio and that $10,000,
I'm gonna buy myself a little place, possibly retire.
Yeah.
Well, I don't believe we ought to start another fight.
But you forget one small detail.
What's that?
I wanna get my hands on Indio, too.
Sure, after me.
Or before you.
Or at the same time.
Is that a proposition?
Mmm-hmm.
An equal partnership.
Why'? Why should I?
Well, I can think of three reasons.
First is, there's 14 of them.
Yeah, that's a lot.
Uh-huh.
A lot for me.
Yeah. No small number even for two of us.
Second reason?
Second reason?
The second reason is you could make it 15-to-1.
Don't forget I wanna play in this game, too.
As you're aware, when two hunters go after the same prey they usually end up shooting each other in the back, and we don't want to shoot each other in the back.
Then the colonel dies?
All right,
I'll be generous.
You can have the reward for Indio and I'll take the reward for the rest of the band.
No. All wrong.
No, Indio's worth
$10,000 dollars, but the rest of the band adds up to much more than that.
Blackie's worth four, Wild's worth three, Nino two.
Nino's one.
Hmm?
Well, Frisco's worth two.
Well, that's $10,000.
Yeah, but there's a few more that'll add up to more than that, I'm sure.
How do you know that?
I have my information,
Colonel.
You know, when all is said and done,
I think I might just take you up on your proposition.
Hmm.
Let's drink to this partnership.
To the partnership, with no tricks, of course.
No tricks.
Now, then, you realize, of course, we're gonna have to figure out some way to get them in the middle.
Yup.
One from the outside, one from the inside.
There's no other way.
One of us will have to join Indio's band.
Why are you looking at me when you say "one of us"?
Because they don't know you.
Wild sees me and his hump will catch on fire.
Tell me, Colonel, how do you propose that
I join up with Indio?
Maybe bring him a bunch of roses?
Well, you could do that, but I'd suggest you take him Sancho Perez.
Who's Sancho Perez?
A friend of Indio's.
Right now he's cooling off.
He's cooling off in Alamogordo jail.
How do you know all this?
I've got my information, too.
Naturally, you'll have to arrange for his release.
Naturally.
Tell me, Colonel, were you ever young?
Yup.
And just as reckless as you.
Then one day something happened.
Made life very precious to me.
What's that?
Or is the question indiscreet?
No.
The question isn't indiscreet.
But the answer could be.
They told me you were put away.
You'd be resting for four long years in prison.
No, Indio, for four weeks.
No more than four weeks.
Sancho.
Who is that with you?
He got me out.
The man's a friend of mine.
Why did he help you?
Did you ask him that?
Yeah. Amigo, why did you help me out?
Well, there's such a big reward being offered on all you gentlemen that I thought I might just tag along on your next robbery.
Might just turn you in to the law.
Amigo that's the one answer that would prove you're all right.
And you arrived just in time, too.
The job is already set.
It's tomorrow.
The place is the bank in El Paso.
Not far from El Paso there's a little town, Santa Cruz.
Tomorrow,
Blackie, Chico, Paco, and you, amigo, will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.
Shoot, kill, get every gun in the area after you especially those from El Paso.
Any others around, we'll take care of them.
And then after the job, we'll all meet again at Las Palmeras.
Where are you going?
Well, if there's gonna be any shooting,
I gotta get my rest.
Hey, amigo, you know when you told that story yesterday, I fell for it.
Big joke, wasn't it, amigo?
Who said I was joking?
I don't get that.
If it's true...
Too bad you have to die.
What is it?
By now they should be at Santa Cruz.
Listen, shorty,
Indio and his band have just robbed the bank here in town.
Now why don't you just sit down and send out the alarm to El Paso and the rest of the towns around here and warn them, right?
But, mister, I didn't hear any shots at the bank, and I sure would have.
You might hear one.
The alarm.
Easy now.
They've robbed the bank at Santa Cruz!
Follow me!
Groggy, the telegraph wires.
Good day, gentlemen.
Good day, sir.
Sir.
Good afternoon.
The other side.
Let's go!
What are you doing here?
You're not running away, are you?
No, I'm not running away.
I'm going after them and I'm going alone.
Our partnership is dissolved.
Now, boy, let's wait and talk it over.
Yeah? Well, all we've done is talk.
I've been reasonable with no results.
Now take it easy.
We only knew the Santa
Cruz part of this plan.
Well, you were the one who had their strategy all worked out.
Now I'm gonna meet Indio.
I see.
I better go along.
I'm going alone. Me.
I have an appointment with Indio and I'm not gonna let anyone else interfere.
You certain about that?
That's right, Colonel.
All right, in that case,
I'm sorry.
That's not bad.
Indio sent four men to Santa Cruz.
And one man returns, a new man without a scratch.
Mmm-mmm.
Indio's no idiot.
When you ride up to him again and show him that little nick you got, he might believe you.
And don't forget, that as of today, the whole gang is worth $40,000 more.
That's the reward offered by the bank to get the money back.
Is the partnership operating again?
Just how do you figure?
Try to convince Indio to go north, and then go along the Rio Bravo.
It's a good spot for an ambush and we can get him between two fires.
Yeah. You on the outside, me on the inside, right?
Mmm-hmm.
North?
North
Yuri.
Wait a minute.
We need time to open it and this isn't the right place.
And the others?
Dead?
Yeah.
After Santa Cruz, we headed for El
Paso and they hit us from all sides.
And you just saved your own skin.
Isn't that right? You yellow...
You did your part of it.
Let's go.
Which way we headed?
North
North? Along
Rio Bravo canyon?
Why not?
Seems like a good place for an ambush to me.
You know a better way to go?
Yeah, south.
Ride to the border?
Yeah, they'll never expect you to cross the border now that the alarm's been sent.
Hmm.
No.
Think we'll head east.
There's a place I know about, Agua Caliente.
Here we are.
That's Agua Caliente.
Yes, I have many friends here.
It looks just like a morgue.
But look out.
It could be one so easily.
They don't like strangers, eh?
No, they don't like anybody.
Wild, you never saw our friend here shoot, right?
No.
Did any of you?
We don't know how you'd be in emergencies.
I was thinking, this is the right place.
I got a way you can show the men.
How's that?
Go into town alone, amigo.
Bravo.
TAVERN
Do you mind telling me how you got here?
I just reasoned it out.
I figured you'd tell Indio to do just exactly the opposite of what we agreed.
And he's suspicious enough to figure out something else.
Since El Paso was out of the question, well, here I am.
Rum, a double.
Tequila for all of us.
Well, well, if it isn't the smoker.
Well.
Remember me, amigo?
Mmm-mmm.
Of course you do.
El Paso
It's a small world.
Yes, and very, very bad.
Now, come on.
You light another match.
I generally smoke just after I eat.
Why don't you come back in about 10 minutes?
Ten minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.
Get up!
Stay calm.
On your feet.
Cuccillo, count to three.
One, two, three!
Stop it!
Who are you?
I'm the one who can open the safe for you.
What safe, señor?
The one from El Paso.
You got there ahead of me.
However...
However?
Open that safe and you're gonna destroy half the bank notes.
I can open it without blowing it up.
What'll it cost?
Two is all I'll pay you.
Five.
Keep your hands off it!
It's easy to steal.
The trouble is in keeping the loot.
Take it out.
Now, every man in New
Mexico is after us.
All they have to do is catch one of us with some of this money and we'll all end up the same way.
We're going to wait here for an entire month if I think it's necessary.
Then everybody will get his share.
And you will wait a month to get your money.
Naturally.
I'll be in the tavern.
The air around here stinks anyway, just like the food.
But the month will go fast.
All right.
Right here.
Let's go.
I was worried about you.
All alone with so many problems to solve.
It's all right here.
Go ahead.
You shouldn't have shot the apples off that tree.
Put it on.
Stop it!
See that they're tied and keep an eye on them.
Why let them alone?
All things at the right time.
What do you mean?
What's he doing now, this sheriff of El Paso?
Right now? Looking for the cash that was in the bank.
Right.
And suppose he finds the bodies of these men just outside El Paso with lots of money on them?
What will the sheriff think?
Well, he...
That's right.
Slim.
What is it, Nino?
A change of plans.
Indio wants you to...
It's not loaded.
I think you should get out fast now.
Here's your guns without bullets.
And listen, don't you let
Indio find you both around.
I know you don't like questions,
Indio, but why are you doing this?
Nino, how long have you known that Monco's a bounty killer?
I found out tonight. Why?
I knew he was one from the first moment he arrived.
The other one's also a bounty killer.
So I have an idea.
They'll be useful to us.
We'll try it.
Those men are a lot better than mine with a gun.
So we'll let all of them get mixed up in a gun battle.
But that won't really matter to me.
Or you.
Because we'll be far away, right?
And we'll have all the money.
Go on.
Go on and wake Cuccillo.
Who did it?
Why don't you look at the knife?
It's mine.
Then it shouldn't be there, should it?
But I didn't kill him,
Indio. I didn't do it.
Cuccillo, it's difficult to prove that.
Indio, I am innocent.
One of your horses is outside.
Let's see if you can get to it.
Indio.
Cuccillo, he just killed Slim
And he helped those two bounty killers get away.
I want them back right now.
Right now.
Right now!
What are you doing here?
Go and get them back!
Groggy, those two bounty killers are sitting on our backs and I tell you they both must be killed right away.
We can't let them go free.
It's done now.
Prepare to get out of here.
Here, Nino.
Indio.
Hold it.
Not a bad idea, Indio.
But I'm one thing you forgot about.
Open it up now.
All right, come on now, open it.
Leave Indio to me.
All right.
Where in hell is it?
I'll kill them, but I'll rip out their guts first.
I have a plan, Groggy.
What?
Let's just wait, Groggy.
They'll be back here.
And this way, there'll be two of us.
Can they come back here?
Your men could've killed them.
Who? They?
Are you sure of that, Indio?
That they haven't?
I thought something different.
You made the boys ride on out to make sure they're both killed and fast.
I'm not as dumb as the rest of them, Indio.
There was no help for it.
Go on.
That watch, it's been a long time that I wanted to ask.
I can see that it means a lot to you, Indio.
Why?
Indio!
Listen to me!
This is Colonel Mortimer!
Douglas Mortimer!
Does the name mean anything to you?
When the chimes end, pick up your gun.
Try and shoot me, Colonel.
Just try.
Very careless of you, old man.
Try this.
Now we start.
Bravo.
There seems to be a family resemblance.
Here.
Naturally, between brother and sister.
My gun.
My boy, you've become rich.
You mean we've become rich, old man.
No, it's all for you.
I think you deserve it.
What about our partnership?
Maybe next time.
Any trouble, boy?
No, old man.
Thought I was having trouble with my adding.
It's all right now.
{5613}{5705}They come closer every day, Pa.
{5708}{5813}- They on our land?|- No, sir.
{5815}{5903}Well, then, it doesn't concern us.
{6008}{6070}Does it?
{6198}{6269}You have something else to say?
{6295}{6358}No, sir.
{8228}{8300}Lord, we...
{8646}{8750}- What'd I do?|- Well, it's what you haven't done, Boy.
{8753}{8858}A man that eats with his hat|on is going nowhere in a hurry.
{8860}{8968}Now, your mother wanted all of|you raised as good Christians,
{8970}{9083}and I might not be able to do that|thorny job as well as she could,
{9085}{9195}but I can do a little something|about your manners. Now, shall we...?
{9215}{9308}Lord, we cleared this land.
{9310}{9429}We ploughed it, sowed it and|harvested. We cooked the harvest.
{9431}{9551}It wouldn't be here, we couldn't eat|it, if we hadn't done it all ourselves.
{9554}{9646}We worked dog-bone|hard for every crumb,
{9649}{9789}but we thank you just the|same, Lord, for this food. Amen.
{10021}{10143}- Where'd you come by the hat, Boy?|- Down by the creek, sir.
{10145}{10275}- Some fella down there passing out hats?|- I found it. It was just lying there.
{10330}{10424}Jacob, you look like you|got something on your mind.
{10426}{10549}- Say what you're thinking.|- We've been through it all before, Pa.
{10551}{10657}Don't paddle around with me. You|were raised to say what you think.
{10660}{10731}You were all raised|to say what you think.
{10734}{10926}The only thing I can't stand is a lot of|noisy silence. Let's have some talking.
{10929}{11051}Now, if you're going to make|a speech, I'm sorry I said it.
{11078}{11161}I know how you feel|about this war, Pa.
{11164}{11255}I guess we all more or|less feel the same way.
{11258}{11352}But I don't see how we can just|sit by and ignore it any longer.
{11355}{11439}Now, you say it's not our|business, not our fight.
{11441}{11590}Well, we're Virginians. I believe anything|that concerns Virginia concerns us.
{11593}{11686}- You do?|- Yes, sir, I do.
{11689}{11741}All right.
{12073}{12132}- John?|- Sir?
{12135}{12297}What are you gonna do? Are you going|to keep your slaves or let 'em go free?
{12324}{12390}You know I don't have any slaves, Pa.
{12393}{12537}That's right, John. You don't|have a slave to your name, do you?
{12569}{12681}James, what about you? Did you ever|think you might like to own a slave?
{12684}{12795}- I guess I never thought about it, Pa.|- Well, think about it.
{12798}{12860}Think about it.
{12863}{12949}If you had the money,|would you buy a slave?
{12951}{13032}- No, sir, I wouldn't.|- Why not?
{13035}{13152}If I can't do my own work, with|my own hands, it'll never get done.
{13155}{13239}Suppose you had a|friend that owned slaves,
{13241}{13332}and suppose somebody's|gonna take 'em away from him.
{13335}{13429}- Would you help him fight to keep 'em?|- No, sir.
{13431}{13555}- Your name's Nathan, isn't it?|- Aw, you know my name, Pa.
{13557}{13671}Well, I seem to remember somethin'|about... I was talking to Henry.
{13674}{13759}- Sir?|- Well, what do you think?
{13761}{13838}- No, sir, I wouldn't.|- Why not?
{13841}{13939}I see no reason to fight for|something I don't believe is right.
{13941}{14006}I don't think a real|friend would ask me to.
{14009}{14158}Why we have this same conversation|every Saturday, I'll never know.
{14161}{14274}But I'm going to pray to the Almighty|that this'll be the end of it.
{14276}{14351}Pass the biscuits!
{15119}{15212}Papa? We're ready to go, Papa.
{15255}{15332}You still miss her, don't you, Papa?
{15335}{15400}Miss her?
{15402}{15540}Oh, Jennie, you don't know|what I feel when I come up here.
{15542}{15662}Even after all these|years. 16 years gone.
{15665}{15716}16 years.
{15719}{15781}And even so, I...
{15784}{15978}I somehow... feel that she's not|dead at all, but only resting.
{15981}{16159}And it's like I'm just waiting for|her to get up and walk home with me.
{16811}{16980}# Be of sin the double cure
{16982}{17180}# Save from wrath and make me pure
{17182}{17350}# Could my tears forever flow
{17352}{17487}# Could my zeal no languor...
{17490}{17556}Did you bring it?
{17559}{17636}- No! Liquorice.|- I'll see you after.
{17727}{17908}# Thou must save, and Thou alone
{17911}{18086}# In my hand no price I bring
{18089}{18282}# Simply to Thy cross I cling
{18285}{18463}# While I draw this fleeting breath
{18466}{18657}# When my eyes shall close in death
{18660}{18816}# When I rise to worids unknown
{18834}{19011}# And behold Thee on Thy throne
{19014}{19192}# Rock of Ages, cleft for me
{19195}{19416}# Let me hide myself in Thee
{19429}{19660}# Amen
{19867}{19962}There are, no doubt, some|present, Charlie Anderson,
{19965}{20092}who wonder why you and yours are|never on time for the Lord's services.
{20095}{20228}Have I kept the Lord|waiting, Pastor Bjoerling?
{20231}{20324}You have not.
{20443}{20583}Our message for today... is duty.
{20637}{20746}Now, this means many|things to many people.
{20748}{20873}But for a Virginian|they all lead to one.
{21158}{21221}James.
{21271}{21358}- Get that fish line.|- The three...
{21361}{21467}most important duties are...
{21470}{21641}- Tell him to stop that.|...duty to God that created us,
{21643}{21696}and loves us.
{21773}{21937}Duty to the state that|gives us sustenance,
{21940}{22021}and provides for us.
{22065}{22188}And duty to our neighbour.
{22243}{22302}Our fellow man,
{22305}{22439}without whom... we... could not live.
{22508}{22642}When you good people can|find it within yourselves
{22645}{22762}to refrain from doing|whatever it is you're doing,
{22765}{22838}I'll get on with the Lord's work.
{22841}{22937}Duty, to a Virginian,
{22940}{23004}is not just a word, my friends.
{23216}{23312}For the last time, Charlie|Anderson, I need that mule of yours.
{23315}{23406}I don't understand your|reluctance to talk about the sale.
{23408}{23512}That mule is a matched Kentucky Red,
{23515}{23606}matched with another that|pulls just like she does.
{23608}{23717}Matched, Abernathy! Do you|understand what matched means?
{23720}{23779}- How much?|- 30 dollars, Federal.
{23782}{23964}- I'll give you 50, Confederate.|- I'll let lightning strike her first.
{24128}{24191}Miss Jennie?
{24217}{24314}I'll be leaving soon, and...
{24423}{24524}- I'll be leaving soon and...|- You said that already, Sam.
{24527}{24632}I did? Oh, yes, I did.
{24635}{24722}I, uh...
{24725}{24842}I'd be eternally grateful if you'd|permit me to call upon you this evening.
{24845}{24914}Eternally is a long time, Sam.
{24946}{25082}Not when one carries the|memory of you, Miss Jennie.
{25085}{25226}I'll look forward to seeing|you after supper, Sam.
{25470}{25594}Abernathy, your idea of a|deal makes my stomach hurt.
{25773}{25929}- You want me to get that mule now?|- Get in that wagon, Gabriel.
{26257}{26359}Charlie Anderson, I wonder if|you'd be good enough to tell me
{26362}{26504}why you bother to come to services.|Meaning no disrespect, of course.
{26507}{26632}It was my wife's last|request, Pastor Bjoerling.
{26634}{26722}Meaning no disrespect, of course.
{26979}{27042}Whoa, boy.
{27111}{27163}Doc. Mrs Witherspoon.
{27166}{27277}Charlie. Looks like I'll|be paying you a visit soon.
{27279}{27342}Uh huh.
{27818}{27888}You haven't said a word.
{27891}{27982}I don't know what to say. I mean...
{27984}{28107}Well, I know what to say.|I just don't know how.
{28109}{28174}Must be all very complicated, then.
{28177}{28269}No, it's... just all memorised.
{28272}{28383}Everything I wanted to say,|I've said a dozen times.
{28386}{28472}I said it to my horse|and it sounded good.
{28474}{28578}I said it again to the|trees and it sounded better.
{28614}{28707}I said it to the moon|and it sounded perfect.
{28709}{28784}The moon can't hear you, Sam.
{28787}{28889}He smiles and smiles,|but he never hears.
{28922}{28984}I do.
{29771}{29851}Well, I'm sure gonna miss her.
{29853}{29925}Is she going somewhere?
{29928}{30012}Every woman goes|somewhere sooner or later.
{30014}{30137}You don't expect her to stay here and|take care of us all her life, do you?
{30139}{30243}I hadn't thought about it. I hadn't|planned on her going anywhere.
{30246}{30361}Well, you'd better get|used to the idea, Boy.
{30364}{30472}Your sister's ripe and|the pickers are here.
{30503}{30632}Of course, I don't suppose you|know what I mean, do you, Boy?
{30634}{30728}I'm not as dumb as you think I am, Pa.
{31144}{31223}Whoa! Halt!
{31244}{31325}Go back up to the house, Boy.
{31728}{31869}There's a rumour you have the coldest|water this side of the Shenandoah.
{31872}{31967}That's right. The best|east of the Mississippi.
{31969}{32085}Six foot deep, 20 foot|down. Help yourself.
{32088}{32163}Dismount, Sergeant.
{32252}{32409}Glad you're here, Johnson. I need to have|a little talk about those cannon of yours.
{32412}{32563}My chickens have stopped laying, the|cow's dried up. Who do I send the bill to?
{32565}{32694}You might try Abe Lincoln.|They're mostly his.
{32697}{32800}When are you going to take|this war seriously, Mr Anderson?
{32803}{32927}Now let me tell you something, Johnson,|before you get on my wrong side.
{32929}{33028}My corn I take serious|because it's my corn.
{33030}{33167}My potatoes and tomatoes and fences|I take note of because they're mine.
{33169}{33275}But this war is not mine|and I take no note of it.
{33339}{33498}You'll take notice when the Yankees|drop a cannonball in your parlour.
{33500}{33686}I might as well tell you now, I can't|think of another thing I wanna hear you say.
{34028}{34100}You have six sons,|don't you, Mr Anderson?
{34103}{34249}Does the size of my family have|some special interest for you?
{34252}{34370}As a matter of fact,|it does. We need men.
{34373}{34458}Two of these men here|are no more than 16.
{34460}{34558}It seems strange that none|of your sons are in the army.
{34560}{34690}It don't seem strange to me with all|the work there is to do around here.
{34693}{34814}I'll come right to the point.|I came out here to get 'em.
{34968}{35024}I say something funny?
{35027}{35143}You came all the way|out here to get my boys?
{35145}{35188}Yes, sir.
{35190}{35334}- Where are your sons now, Mr Anderson?|- You wanna see 'em, do you?
{35337}{35399}Yes, sir, I do.
{35532}{35598}Jacob?
{35657}{35713}James?
{35789}{35853}John?
{35855}{35911}Nathan?
{35982}{36024}Henry?
{36217}{36279}Boy?
{36489}{36579}If you've got anything to|say to 'em, they'll listen.
{36582}{36676}There's a Yankee army breathing|down your neck, Mr Anderson.
{36679}{36773}- You're town bred.|- I don't see what that has to do...
{36775}{36875}I've got 500 acres of|good, rich dirt here.
{36878}{37019}While the rains come and the sun shines,|it'll grow anything I've a mind to plant.
{37022}{37124}We've pulled every stump,|we've cleared every field,
{37127}{37214}and we did it ourselves,|without the sweat of one slave.
{37217}{37306}- So?|- "So"?
{37309}{37380}So can you give me one good reason
{37383}{37504}why I should send my family,|that took me a lifetime to raise,
{37507}{37629}down that road like a bunch of damn|fools to do somebody else's fighting?
{37632}{37725}Virginia needs all of|her sons, Mr Anderson.
{37728}{37828}That might be so, Johnson,|but these are my sons.
{37830}{37899}They don't belong to the state.
{37902}{38014}When they were babies, I never saw the|state coming round with a spare tit.
{38017}{38109}We never asked anything of|the state or expected anything.
{38111}{38233}We do our own living, and|thanks to no man for the right.
{38235}{38326}But seeing as how you're so|worried about it, I'll tell ya.
{38329}{38479}If any of my boys thinks this war's right|and wants to join in, he's free to do it.
{38481}{38582}Y'all hear that? D'you hear it?
{38585}{38683}Do you want to dress up like|these fellas? Here's your chance.
{39169}{39246}Patrol, mount.
{39430}{39482}Mr Anderson,
{39485}{39654}if you can sit in the middle of this war|and not get touched, I congratulate you.
{39656}{39739}Where are these Yankees now?
{39741}{39814}About ten miles that way,
{39816}{39946}about ten or twelve miles that|way, and about five miles that way.
{39949}{40019}Which way are you headed?
{40021}{40084}That way.
{42494}{42587}What do you do with dead soldiers?
{42971}{43080}- Where's their army?|- Harrisonburg.
{43145}{43302}You ride over there, Nathan. Take Henry|with you, tell 'em to come get 'em.
{43305}{43367}Yes, sir.
{43445}{43545}Does it concern us now?
{43548}{43690}You go to the house, get|something and cover 'em up.
{44173}{44235}Come on.
{44719}{44812}- Don't you think we ought to wait?|- No.
{44961}{45074}Papa? Sam would like|to talk to you, Papa.
{45076}{45138}All right, Jennie.
{45286}{45376}- Good evening, sir.|- Sam.
{45722}{45779}It's bedtime.
{45781}{45862}Bedtime? Why, it's only...
{46384}{46466}Picker's here, Pa.
{46704}{46792}- What did he mean by that?|- It's nothing, Sam. Have a seat.
{46795}{46891}- I'd prefer to stand, sir.|- No, you sit down, Sam.
{46894}{46985}I never talk to a man|who's looking down on me.
{47120}{47246}Now, there's something you|want to talk to me about?
{47249}{47326}- Yes, sir.|- Sit down, Sam.
{47449}{47600}I've wanted to talk to you for|a long time now, sir, but...
{47602}{47715}Well, to come straight to the|point of the matter, sir, I...
{47717}{47907}- I want to ask for your daughter's hand.|- You mean you want to marry her, Sam?
{47922}{47985}Yes, sir.
{48061}{48142}- Why?|- Sir?
{48145}{48291}- Why do you want to marry her?|- Well, I... I love her, Mr Anderson.
{48475}{48549}Well, that's not good enough, Sam.
{48552}{48629}I beg your pardon?
{48632}{48702}- Do you like her?|- Well, I just said I...
{48705}{48880}No, you said you loved her. There's some|difference between loving and liking.
{48952}{49112}When I married Jennie's mother,|I didn't love her. I liked her.
{49115}{49195}I liked her a whole lot.
{49197}{49298}I liked Martha for at least|three years after we were married.
{49301}{49443}And then one day it just dawned|on me I loved her. I still do.
{49474}{49541}I still do.
{49544}{49685}You see, Sam, when you love|a woman without liking her,
{49687}{49847}a night can be long and cold, and|contempt comes up with the sun.
{49879}{49962}Do you understand all|this I'm telling you?
{49965}{50020}Yes, sir.
{50022}{50071}Well?
{50101}{50260}Well, I... I like Jennie,|sir. I've always liked her.
{50362}{50463}All right, then. You be good to her.
{50466}{50563}Because if you don't, it's|between you and me, boy.
{50597}{50747}- Then you have no objection, sir?|- I didn't say that.
{50750}{50843}Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
{50996}{51087}Thank you, sir. Thank you.
{51548}{51638}I suppose that means Papa|Charlie gave permissión?
{51641}{51828}Sam'll be a couple of miles down the|road before it dawns on him to tell me.
{52215}{52292}It was Mother's.
{52338}{52423}You'll look beautiful, Jennie.
{52426}{52589}Being married to someone you love|must be the most wonderful feeling.
{52592}{52706}When I was a little girl, I|slept all alone in a big room.
{52708}{52789}My bed had a feather mattress.
{52792}{52939}Outside, there was thunder, lightning|and rain falling on our tin roof.
{52942}{53101}I'd lie there under my blankets,|feeling so snug and good and warm.
{53103}{53267}Because I knew I was safe. I|was loved and somebody cared.
{53270}{53378}And now, married to James, it's|that same little-girl feeling.
{53381}{53541}- I'm loved, and somebody cares.|- Oh, I am so happy, I want to shout.
{53543}{53624}That's what it feels like, too.
{54963}{55043}First-rate-looking|animals you got here, son.
{55046}{55137}They should be. I do everything|but sing 'em to sleep.
{55140}{55306}Anderson's the name, Mr Carroll.|Nine horses and two mules.
{55308}{55406}You're right, Mr Tinkham.|These'll do just fine.
{55425}{55585}These folks sure know quality. I'll take|these two and four out in the pasture.
{55587}{55674}What do you mean, you'll take 'em?
{55746}{55898}Well, howdy, Mr Anderson. I|ain't seen you in quite a spell.
{55901}{56016}Well, I don't get around to|visiting jails much, Tinkham.
{56067}{56126}This here's Mr Carroll.
{56128}{56267}Mr Osborne, Mr Marshall. They're|Federal purchasing agents.
{56270}{56367}- Buying horses for the cavalry.|- That's right, Mr Anderson.
{56370}{56506}We've got a set price we can pay, but I'd|like to hear what you think they're worth.
{56508}{56596}The horses aren't for sale.
{56598}{56718}What my son tells you is|the gospel truth, gentlemen.
{56721}{56886}You can carve his words in stone if you've|a mind to. The horses are not for sale.
{56888}{56986}That may be, but I just|think I ought to tell you
{56988}{57083}we're authorised to|confiscate any we can't buy.
{57086}{57186}- What's "confiscate" mean, Pa?|- Steal.
{57242}{57314}No, I don't think|you quite understand.
{57317}{57462}You're not going to take one horse off|this farm. You might as well forget it.
{57559}{57629}You said these were reasonable people.
{57632}{57761}Mr Carroll, everybody in the county|knows they're just sitting out the war.
{57763}{57867}I think what Mr Tinkham|means is that he figured
{57869}{58037}anybody too yellow to fight wouldn't mind|making a couple of dollars off the war.
{58039}{58166}- "Yellow"?|- I apologise for my son's manners.
{58168}{58242}He was taught to have more|respect for his elders.
{58244}{58302}I accept your apology, sir.
{58304}{58397}Jacob, I don't know what gets|into you every once in a while.
{58399}{58471}You know you shouldn't|hit this gentleman,
{58473}{58587}as long as I'm around to do it!
{59259}{59322}James! Henry!
{61579}{61702}I'm not in the habit of making promises|to strangers, but you have my word.
{61704}{61842}If you don't get off this farm this|minute, I'm gonna shoot you stone dead.
{62886}{62955}That fella Tinkham,
{62958}{63132}he's the only man I know that started|at the bottom and went down in the worid.
{63134}{63243}He used to steal horses for|nothing. Now he gets paid for it.
{63246}{63356}Boy, get out of there|before you catch cold.
{63359}{63431}Go on in the house.
{63434}{63543}- See what you got us into?|- Me? You hit him.
{63545}{63628}You would have if I|hadn't beat you to it.
{63630}{63799}Pa, first it was Johnson,|and that was on our land.
{63802}{63958}Now they come driving right into our yard.|Aren't we going to do anything about it?
{63960}{64100}Well, I must be getting|old. Seems to me we just did.
{64405}{64524}It's no easy job, Sam,|taking care of a woman.
{64527}{64595}No, sir.
{64612}{64683}Yeah.
{64685}{64804}They expect things|they never asked for.
{64833}{64918}And when they don't get|them, they ask you why.
{64920}{65016}Sometimes they don't ask.
{65019}{65115}And they just go ahead and punish you
{65118}{65252}for not doing something you didn't|know you were supposed to do.
{65254}{65310}What, for instance, sir?
{65313}{65496}Well, that's a very difficult question|to answer, Sam. You're never quite sure.
{65528}{65663}It's just that it's sort|of, you might say, relative.
{65694}{65787}- Relative to what, sir?|- How they're feeling at the moment.
{65789}{65883}- How's that?|- You never know.
{65959}{66047}I don't believe I understand|what you're telling me, sir.
{66049}{66214}I know. I never understood it|myself. I never understood it.
{66217}{66317}It's just one of those things, Sam.
{66319}{66423}It's around. You just|don't ever see it.
{66474}{66551}Now, suppose...
{66554}{66689}Suppose Jennie started to cry one day.
{66692}{66790}You don't know what she's crying|about so you ask. You follow me?
{66793}{66843}Yes, sir.
{66880}{66968}You ask her, and she won't tell you.
{67014}{67178}And that's when you ask her what it|was you did that caused her to cry.
{67278}{67359}She still won't tell you.
{67390}{67498}And that's when you|start to get angry.
{67500}{67585}But don't get angry, Sam.
{67617}{67753}She won't tell you why she's|crying because she doesn't know.
{67755}{67845}Women are like that, Sam.
{67848}{68041}And it's exasperating. It's... urgh!|But don't let it make you angry.
{68078}{68138}No.
{68140}{68283}When she gets like that, just|walk up and hug her a little bit.
{68285}{68425}Cos that's all they really want|when they're like that, Sam.
{68428}{68540}A little loving. You|understand me, don't you?
{68594}{68653}No, sir.
{68655}{68717}You don't, huh?
{68867}{68999}There's something you must remember.|Husbands like to be alone once in a while.
{69002}{69064}Why?
{69115}{69269}You never know why. But I can always|tell when James wants to be alone.
{69272}{69445}A mood comes over him. I can always see|it in his eyes before it really gets there.
{69448}{69544}I don't know where the|mood comes from or why.
{69546}{69646}But that's when I leave him alone.
{69649}{69770}It seems sometimes things|get so thick around a man,
{69773}{69870}that he comes to feel|everything is closing in on him.
{69873}{70038}And that's when he wants to be left|alone. You understand, don't you?
{70086}{70149}No.
{70785}{70845}Dearly beloved,
{70848}{71040}forasmuch as marriage is a|holy estate, ordained by God,
{71043}{71146}to be held in honour by all...
{71500}{71627}To love and to cherish|till death us do part.
{71630}{71774}"According to God's holy ordinance,|and thereto I plight thee my troth."
{71776}{71864}According to God's holy ordinance,
{71866}{71964}and thereto I plight thee my troth.
{71991}{72136}"I, Jennie, take thee,|Sam, to my wedded husband."
{72139}{72239}I, Jennie, take thee,|Sam, to my wedded husband.
{72241}{72272}"To have..."
{72275}{72360}To have and to hold|from this day forward,
{72363}{72444}for better, for worse,
{72446}{72521}for richer or poorer,
{72524}{72599}in sickness and in health.
{72601}{72752}To love, cherish, to obey,|till death us do part.
{72781}{72861}According to God's holy ordinance.
{72864}{72944}And thereto I plight thee my troth.
{73211}{73344}"Receive this ring as a token|of wedded love and troth."
{73346}{73527}Receive this ring as a token|of wedded love and troth.
{73559}{73636}Join your right hands.
{73736}{73887}Forasmuch as Sam and Jennie have|consented together in holy wedlock,
{73890}{74040}and have declared the same before God|and in the presence of this company,
{74043}{74120}I pronounce them man and wife.
{74123}{74288}In the name of the Father and of|the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
{74290}{74446}What God hath joined together,|let not man put asunder.
{74496}{74586}Congratulations, Sam.
{74589}{74646}Jennie.
{74728}{74809}Excuse me. Excuse me, sir.
{74918}{75040}- The captain's compliments, sir.|- Go on, Corporal.
{75064}{75260}He wishes to see you immediately. The|Yankees broke through at Winchester, sir.
{75263}{75337}Very well, Corporal.
{75774}{75899}I'll have to leave now.|You know that, don't you?
{76007}{76059}Do you understand?
{76130}{76187}Do you?
{76609}{76668}Ugh!
{76671}{76751}It's started.
{76754}{76847}- Pa!|- You just sit quiet.
{76850}{76966}Pa, something terrible's going to|happen if we don't get Ann home.
{76969}{77011}All right.
{77014}{77107}Take the carriage. Jennie|and I will go with Harkens.
{77110}{77187}Jacob, drive them home.|Nathan, go with them.
{77190}{77305}- Henry, you find Doc Witherspoon.|- What shall I tell him, sir?
{77307}{77421}- Nothing. When I send for him, he knows.|- Yes, sir.
{77727}{77817}I'll be back, sir,|just as soon as I can.
{77849}{77942}You take care of yourself, you hear?
{80137}{80259}Congratulations, son. It's|a boy. I know the sound.
{80312}{80375}Congratulations, James.
{80459}{80536}Ann wants to see you.
{80816}{80942}Something went wrong,|Charlie. I'm sorry.
{81027}{81098}It's a girl.
{81292}{81325}James?
{81329}{81453}- No. I might break it.|- How do you break an Anderson?
{82195}{82334}I don't know how you could bring yourself|to do this to me, Tom Witherspoon,
{82337}{82438}after all the business I've|given to you over the years.
{82441}{82570}It's not that I have any|objection to giris, you understand.
{82572}{82697}It's just that it's awful|hard to break a habit.
{82748}{82863}- How old are you now, Boy?|- 18, sir.
{82866}{83022}That means you'll be 20 in four|years. 18 to you is 16 to me.
{83025}{83115}Just a little bit, sir.|I've never tasted it.
{83117}{83278}That's no good reason. I've known men|that've been drinking hard all their lives.
{83281}{83386}They've never tasted it|either. Isn't that right, Doc?
{83388}{83452}All right, here we are.
{83455}{83527}Here we go.
{83530}{83594}Here's to the ladies.
{83746}{83881}- Well, these are busy days. Good night.|- Good night, Doctor.
{84182}{84238}Tom...
{84328}{84416}Tom, what's happening?
{84418}{84577}- Virginia's losing, isn't she?|- It looks that way, Charlie.
{84581}{84671}How do you feel about it all?
{84711}{84821}I was born in Virginia.|Lived here all my life.
{84823}{84946}Raised three sons and two|daughters under her flag.
{84948}{85086}My oldest son, Paul, is buried|somewhere in Pennsylvania.
{85088}{85186}I'm sorry. I didn't know that.
{85188}{85376}They said Gettysburg is where he fell,|at a place called Little Round Top.
{85411}{85540}My youngest boy came home|last week with tuberculosis.
{85571}{85654}He won't see another Christmas.
{85686}{85858}My third son rides with General|Forrest. I don't know where they are.
{85861}{86002}You... You were asking me|how I feel about it all.
{86005}{86131}That's the only way I|know how to answer you.
{86550}{86692}If she needs me, send for me.|There's another baby due up the river.
{86695}{86757}Go on.
{87473}{87532}Get out of here. Git!
{87536}{87653}Or go find yourself a tree.|Just don't draw no fire to me.
{87770}{87859}Get out of here. Get out of here now.
{87950}{88013}Get out of here.
{88168}{88267}Get out of here! Git! You hear?
{91223}{91323}Well, now, look how young this one is.
{91361}{91532}I swear to goodness if these Rebs ain't|gonna be sending out grandpappies next.
{91534}{91611}Let me hold that rifle, Johnny.
{91614}{91688}My name isn't Johnny.
{91691}{91776}- Let me have the rifle.|- What for?
{91817}{91965}It don't set right with the officers when|they see prisoners walking around armed.
{91968}{92143}Now give me that rifle before I put a|ball through that dumb head of yours.
{92233}{92293}I admire spunk in a boy.
{92296}{92405}But if you don't do|what I say from now on,
{92408}{92497}you're gonna find out spunk|don't come free for nothing.
{92499}{92621}- All right, Reb, let's go.|- I'm no soldier.
{92623}{92697}I don't look that ignorant, do I?
{92699}{92843}We seen enough of them Johnny|Reb caps to last us a lifetime.
{92936}{93039}- Go tell my Pa.|- Where they taking you, boy?
{93042}{93104}I don't know. Just|tell him what happened.
{93107}{93202}You don't have to tell his|pa nothing. You're free.
{94307}{94379}Master Anderson! Master Anderson!
{94460}{94520}- They took him.|- What are you saying?
{94523}{94620}- They took him.|- Who's "they"? Who'd they take?
{94623}{94718}- The Yankee men. They took the Boy.|- How many Yankee men?
{94720}{94839}I don't know. Five, six. I don't know.
{95063}{95140}Now it concerns us.
{95509}{95623}Nothing. There's footprints,|but they don't lead anywhere.
{95648}{95727}We haven't seen another|man since we left the house.
{95729}{95794}What do we do now?
{95797}{95938}Well, we'll go home|and we'll pack up...
{95999}{96076}and we'll leave tonight.
{96600}{96689}It's late. Won't Mr|Abernathy be looking for you?
{96692}{96831}He gone, Missy. Gone to Richmond.|Left the field boss in charge.
{96834}{96900}Won't he be wondering where you are?
{96903}{97049}Old Jethro don't care about me. When|my momma died, he even took our cabin.
{97052}{97133}I don't got to go back, do I, Missy?
{97135}{97257}Man say I'm free. Don't that|mean I don't gotta go back?
{97259}{97371}Well, if the man said|you were free, Gabriel,
{97374}{97514}I guess that means you can go|anywhere in the worid you wanna go.
{97714}{97855}You mean I can just walk on down|that road and keep on walkin'?
{97858}{97924}You can run if you like, Gabriel.
{98074}{98136}Goodbye, Missy.
{99079}{99176}We can probably make better|time if we stay off the roads.
{99179}{99323}We can cut across here. There's a Unión|camp the other side of the ford. Here.
{99325}{99433}- Is that the closest?|- Yes, sir, far as I know.
{99435}{99578}The ones that took the Boy were probably|skirmishers. I don't think we'd find 'em.
{99580}{99681}- They turned him in as a prisoner?|- That's about all they can do.
{99684}{99840}All right, we'll try that one.|Mount up. I'll be with you directly.
{100234}{100296}Come in.
{100407}{100484}Hello, Papa Charlie.
{100577}{100716}Well, I think she's|getting bigger than you are.
{100801}{100921}Ann, we're leaving, and|James is staying with you.
{100953}{101092}I don't know how these people|dare take a son of mine.
{101124}{101245}When I catch them, it's gonna|be a horrible thing to behold.
{101248}{101338}The Boy means a great|deal to you, doesn't he?
{101355}{101435}All of my sons mean|a great deal to me.
{101438}{101514}But the Boy...
{101516}{101606}My Martha died the night he was born.
{101609}{101678}I look at him, I see her.
{101758}{101800}I'll pray for you.
{101803}{101955}It's too late to do any praying for|me and expect satisfactory results.
{101985}{102046}There.
{102049}{102121}You and James decided on a name?
{102153}{102215}Martha.
{102261}{102331}Oh, she'd like that.
{102363}{102448}My Martha'd like that very much.
{102520}{102576}Ann...
{102625}{102810}I haven't told you, but we're all|mighty proud to have you in our family.
{102884}{102961}I love you very much.
{103854}{103957}Now, you take care of|yourself. You hear me?
{103960}{104051}We'll be back, just as soon as...
{104185}{104319}- Where do you think you're going?|- Wherever you go, Papa.
{104321}{104454}From what these preachers tell me,|where I'm going, you wouldn't like it.
{104456}{104541}You may be on your way,|but you aren't there yet.
{104544}{104624}Never mind that. You're|not going with us.
{104626}{104736}So unstrap, unhook, get out of your|brother's clothes. You're a woman.
{104739}{104944}I'm a woman, but I don't see anybody|here I can't outrun, outride and outshoot.
{104946}{105039}I'll unstrap for|you, Papa. And unhook.
{105041}{105135}I'll even sit here and|watch you ride out of sight.
{105138}{105215}- And then what?|- I'll follow.
{105218}{105270}That's what I thought.
{105273}{105358}Don't worry about the place|here, Pa. We'll manage.
{105360}{105443}You just keep that little|Martha warm and fat.
{105445}{105581}She'll probably turn out to be the|only one around here with a brain.
{105584}{105669}- Bye, son.|- Goodbye, Pa.
{107639}{107713}You the leader of this band of fools?
{107716}{107795}Colonel Fairchild is my name.
{107797}{107972}Whether or not I am the leader of fools|is a question which often enters my mind.
{107975}{108078}To whom do I have the|pleasure of speaking, sir?
{108081}{108161}Charlie Anderson is my name.
{108164}{108280}You better decide later whether|speaking with me is a pleasure or not.
{108282}{108383}- You have business with me?|- Yes, sir, I do.
{108386}{108510}All right, Mr Nelson.|What can I do for you, sir?
{108512}{108602}Well, you can return|my son, for a start.
{108605}{108715}Then you can issue some kind of|order, or whatever it is you do,
{108717}{108840}and instruct your people to keep off|my farm and leave my family alone.
{108842}{108927}- Your son?|- My youngest son.
{108930}{108999}Your people came on|my farm and took him.
{109001}{109099}- Why?|- That's what I'd like to know, Colonel.
{109101}{109252}- He's a prisoner and your army's got him.|- He isn't a Confederate?
{109255}{109379}No, sir. He's an Anderson,|and that's all he is.
{109381}{109469}- How old is he?|- He's 16.
{109729}{109848}Could you show me on the|map where your farm is?
{109851}{109928}Well, it's Shenandoah Gap.
{109990}{110082}It shows here. Right there.
{110085}{110187}It couldn't have been any|of my men who took your son,
{110190}{110286}because we haven't|been in your section.
{110289}{110374}But I think you should|understand something.
{110376}{110520}My men fought a battle the other day|with Rebels who threw stones at them,
{110522}{110585}because that was all that they had.
{110587}{110772}We took 1500 prisoners and there wasn't|50 rounds of ammunition among them.
{110804}{110857}What are you telling me, Colonel?
{110860}{110947}Only that what you're trying|to do is nearly impossible.
{110950}{111074}Every corps in our army is taking|thousands of prisoners each day.
{111076}{111202}How do you expect to|find one 16-year-old boy?
{111654}{111800}If I had him, Mr Anderson, I'd give him|to you. But I don't have any prisoners.
{111802}{111927}We sent them all to the|railroad for shipment north.
{112045}{112171}If you find the boy, give this|slip to the officer in charge.
{112174}{112222}- It may help.|- What is it?
{112225}{112341}It's a statement from me that|your son was taken by mistake,
{112344}{112528}and it would be considered a personal|favour to me if he is released to you.
{112531}{112621}Where's that railroad you|send your prisoners to?
{112624}{112692}It's at lvy Glen.
{112724}{112877}I do wish you good luck, Mr Anderson.|I have a 16-year-old son, too.
{112880}{113033}He's in school in Boston... thank God.
{113582}{113647}No stragglers back there!
{113695}{113776}All right, keep moving.
{113936}{114061}Go on inside. Keep those|men moving back there.
{114103}{114181}All right, move along.
{114365}{114473}The Boy couldn't be|with them, could he, Pa?
{114867}{114956}- I've a note for Captain Richards.|- Sir?
{115147}{115242}- You Anderson?|- I'm Anderson.
{115245}{115317}There's nothing I can do for you.
{115320}{115444}I don't recall asking you to do|anything for me. I'm looking for my son.
{115447}{115538}- I don't have him.|- How do you know that?
{115541}{115712}All I'm asking is to look through these|cattle cars. Is that too much to expect?
{115715}{115853}If your son is among these prisoners,|you're too late. There's a war going on.
{115856}{115969}- Sergeant! Lock 'em up.|- All right, lock 'em up.
{115972}{116112}- We have schedules to meet.|- Lock 'em up.
{116527}{116597}What'd he say, Pa?
{116600}{116687}He says he has schedules to meet.
{118230}{118292}Sergeant!
{118510}{118584}Get this stuff off|of the tracks, mister.
{118587}{118661}What are you doing? Know|what the penalty is...
{118663}{118834}You'd all please me if you'd drop your|guns and stick your hands up in the air.
{118837}{118939}- Drop the rifles!|- Right now!
{119173}{119276}Now I remember. Anderson.|Your name is Anderson.
{119278}{119366}You can all turn around|and start walkin'.
{119368}{119466}I don't care where you go, as|long as you get out of my sight.
{119468}{119608}- You're the man looking for his son.|- You're the man with schedules to keep.
{119611}{119694}Come on, move out. Come on, let's go.
{119697}{119814}Let's go, Captain. You|heard him. Come on. Move.
{119916}{120003}How long do you intend to|keep my train here, sir?
{120006}{120159}I'm glad you asked, because I believe|in a man knowing all about his business.
{120162}{120263}First I'm gonna empty your|train, and then I'm gonna burn it.
{120266}{120356}- Burn it?|- Open up those doors.
{120387}{120507}You can't do that. You|can't burn my train.
{120509}{120581}Maybe. You gotta give|me credit for trying.
{120583}{120723}- But why? Why?|- It's not the kind of a train I favour.
{121033}{121127}You can get out. You're free.
{122262}{122319}Boy?
{122716}{122778}Jacob!
{122943}{123024}Boy's not here, Jennie.
{123992}{124084}- Sam!|- Jennie...
{124489}{124649}You'd better leave soon. There's a|regular cavalry patrol on these railroads.
{124797}{124922}- Pa? What about the train, Pa?|- Uh, sir?
{124973}{125115}Sir, I've been the engineer|on this train for ten years.
{125118}{125200}She's been a good train|all that time and, well...
{125203}{125338}it ain't right to burn her just|cos she come onto hard times.
{125364}{125465}Now, you run a sad|kind of a train, mister.
{125468}{125640}It takes people away when they don't|wanna go, and won't bring 'em back.
{125643}{125754}But I'll leave it to the|ones that were on it. Sam?
{126089}{126172}Burn it.
{126207}{126319}Burn the train! Burn it!
{126544}{126715}Henry, give Sam the Boy's horse. The|rest of you, get mounted. Come on.
{126959}{127129}You be the only officer here, sir, and|the boys are after knowing what to do.
{127184}{127267}- Go home.|- Home, sir?
{127269}{127373}The war is lost. Go|back to your families.
{127500}{127658}I had no right to tell him that, but|those men can't go through another fight.
{127660}{127750}We knew before the last|one we couldn't win.
{127753}{127825}Why'd you go?
{127852}{127954}Easier than running, I guess.
{128070}{128189}If there's a cavalry patrol|around, we'd better move.
{129118}{129177}Hello, Carter.
{129179}{129310}You can have your chance tonight,|Boy, if you wanna take it.
{129313}{129393}- Chance for what?|- To run.
{129424}{129566}They don't waste many men on prisoner|duty and they're usually the worst.
{129569}{129646}They plan on herding us|on that stern-wheeler.
{129649}{129775}Some of us don't fancy no|sightseeing trip up north.
{129778}{129932}When they open that gate tonight, stick|as close to me as a flea on a hound dog.
{129935}{130068}There's something else. Once we|get going, you're on your own.
{130070}{130210}I gotta forget that you|ain't nothing but a lap baby.
{130734}{130846}Nathan, you and Henry take the|horses over to that barn there.
{130849}{130926}Yes, sir.
{131651}{131781}- Jacob, see if you can get a fire started.|- Yes, sir.
{132900}{133006}- Say, what's Pa doing in there?|- Sleeping, I guess.
{133009}{133070}I can hear him moving.
{133569}{133664}That's sure gonna|taste good about now.
{133695}{133786}For somebody, it is.
{133956}{134004}- Sam?|- Sir?
{134006}{134081}You too, Jennie.
{134405}{134467}Here.
{134878}{135015}Your mother and I had it a little better|than this. It's not very comfortable.
{135018}{135092}But when you've lived|together for years,
{135095}{135212}you'll realise that|comfort's not what counts.
{135339}{135489}It's customary for a gentleman to|carry his bride across the threshold.
{135568}{135684}So, if you wanna...|you can go ahead and...
{135768}{135830}Yes, sir.
{136294}{136406}- What are you looking at?|- Nothing, sir.
{136714}{136807}All right, move along. Move along.
{136810}{136872}Inside!
{137065}{137127}- Move along there.|- Now!
{137171}{137246}Get that other guard.
{137249}{137340}Come on. Come on. This way.
{137541}{137618}Get down. Get down.
{138184}{138261}Get down. Get down.
{140487}{140571}Them blue-bellies must be everywhere.
{140574}{140708}What we're gonna have to do is travel|at night, heading south. Always south.
{140711}{140810}Then we can't hardly help|coming on something friendly.
{140812}{140900}But our farm is north.
{141689}{141860}- You hear something?|- I smell something. Wood smoke.
{142111}{142188}That's a Confederate camp.
{142191}{142331}Wood smoke ain't all you|smelled. You smelled country boys.
{142676}{142770}I gotten these over|at the hospital wagon.
{142772}{142870}Fellas they belonged to|won't be needing 'em no more.
{142872}{143022}The lieutenant says they'll be pulling|back and we're welcome to go with them.
{143025}{143096}That was good of him.
{143222}{143318}- What is this?|- Don't ask.
{143321}{143476}It ain't nothing your mama ever set|the table with, you can believe that.
{143479}{143626}But we're walking in tall cotton, Boy.|Down in Vicksburg, they're eating rats.
{145058}{145125}Yankees! Yankees!
{145301}{145371}Here, take this.
{145817}{145883}Don't fire till I tell you.
{145886}{145969}I've never shot at a man before.
{145972}{146039}They ain't gonna know that.
{146847}{146923}- Lieutenant?|- Yes, sir?
{146926}{147008}Is that a Confederate|cow or a Unión cow?
{147011}{147086}That must be a Unión cow, sir.
{147088}{147191}- Are Unión cows tasty?|- Quite tasty, sir.
{147193}{147274}- Then take her prisoner.|- Yes, sir.
{147376}{147411}Hyah!
{148772}{148807}Sorry, sir.
{148810}{148983}That's all right, Lieutenant.|You scared a few pounds off her.
{148986}{149017}Get ready.
{149020}{149058}Fire!
{149323}{149361}Fire!
{149800}{149862}Charge!
{149920}{149982}Charge!
{150188}{150244}Fire!
{151184}{151256}You might as well know|something now, Boy.
{151258}{151387}In case you got any doubts, we|ain't got a dog's chance in hell.
{152026}{152150}I ain't never seen nobody get|so peevish over a cow before.
{152881}{152943}What you...
{155182}{155244}Howdy!
{155336}{155412}Hello.
{155414}{155475}What can I do for you?
{155478}{155580}Just a drink of your|water, if you don't mind.
{155583}{155701}Come a long ways.|Got a long ways to go.
{155704}{155832}You're welcome to all you can|drink and all you can carry.
{155864}{155927}Obliged.
{155929}{156057}Nice place you got here.|Must support quite a few.
{156059}{156180}- Nine.|- Nine? Lmagine that.
{156212}{156359}How come I don't see none|of 'em around... except you?
{156362}{156449}They're all away|from home for a while.
{156849}{156939}Aw, Mule, you sure do a job up right.
{156942}{157055}Yeah, I'm bound to|say it. You sure do.
{157115}{157226}You two look around and|see if they got any horses.
{157229}{157325}I'll see what's in the house.
{157328}{157393}Yeah.
{158837}{158914}James?
{159330}{159388}- Mule?|- James!
{159445}{159508}James!
{160799}{160839}This all there is?
{160842}{161000}We used the last of the flour yesterday,|and this is the last of the coffee.
{161243}{161355}You don't think we're going|to find him, do you, Sam?
{161384}{161438}No, sir, I don't.
{161479}{161633}Boy could be any place, Pa. He may|even be somewhere up north by now.
{161635}{161754}- Federal prison, you mean?|- Yes, sir.
{161774}{161950}The horses haven't had a good feed in|a long time, Pa. They're almost spent.
{161953}{162025}I wanna say something.
{162057}{162151}I've known since the train that|we weren't liable to find him.
{162154}{162266}It was just a hair of a|chance that we got Sam back.
{162269}{162389}I knew that... Maybe I knew|even before we left home.
{162392}{162534}But somehow I just had to try.
{162552}{162694}And if we don't try, we don't do.
{162725}{162805}And if we don't do,
{162837}{162924}why are we here on this earth?
{163069}{163131}I...
{163156}{163250}I hope you all understood.
{163253}{163356}We understood you, Pa,|and we're all with you.
{163390}{163465}Tomorrow morning we'll start back.
{163619}{163676}Pa...
{163744}{163864}I'll admit I don't feel|the same way I did before.
{163866}{163944}And I'll admit that I'd|sure like to get home.
{163946}{164046}But I don't want you|giving up because of us.
{164049}{164205}I'm with you. I don't wanna go|home unless you really want to.
{164294}{164351}Thank you, son.
{164414}{164507}We'll go home. Maybe the Boy's there.
{166326}{166420}Hold your fire, men. Hold your fire.
{167245}{167324}Dead!
{167721}{167795}How old are you?
{167833}{167925}- How old?|- 16.
{168123}{168205}I'm not gonna kill you.
{168208}{168294}I want you to live.
{168296}{168397}I want you to live to be an old man.
{168400}{168577}And I want you to have|many, many, many children.
{168580}{168711}And I want you to feel|about your children then
{168714}{168795}the way I feel about mine now.
{168853}{168927}And some day,
{168960}{169152}when a man comes along and kills one|of them, I want you to remember. I...
{169412}{169495}I want you to remember.
{170836}{170961}We'll bury him on the|farm, near his mother.
{172669}{172827}- Somebody sick, Tom?|- Where have you been?
{172830}{172892}What's wrong?
{172937}{173053}- What's wrong? The baby...|- The baby's all right, Charlie.
{173056}{173100}Uh...
{173102}{173203}James and Ann...
{173224}{173298}are dead.
{173486}{173543}We...
{173546}{173627}We figured scavengers did it.
{173630}{173718}From what I could tell,
{173721}{173802}James died instantly.
{173840}{174000}It wasn't until two days later|I just happened to come by.
{174002}{174065}Ann had...
{174096}{174155}She was dead, too.
{174157}{174261}I had them buried near Martha.
{174290}{174472}I thought you'd like that. It|somehow seemed the only place.
{174505}{174602}- Where's the baby, Tom?|- Upstairs.
{174605}{174682}I found a woman to take care of her.
{174712}{174776}She's all right, Charlie.
{176122}{176194}The child is my granddaughter.
{176432}{176509}Her name is Martha.
{176793}{176918}It's been a long time,|Martha, since I held a baby.
{176988}{177066}It's been a long time.
{177225}{177328}O Lord, we cleared this land.
{177366}{177446}We ploughed it and sowed it,
{177477}{177539}and harvested.
{177607}{177690}We cooked the harvest. We...
{177723}{177773}It wouldn't...
{177776}{177959}It wouldn't be here, we wouldn't be|eating it, if we hadn't done it all...
{177962}{178037}all ourselves.
{179825}{179981}I don't even know what to|say to you any more, Martha.
{180051}{180182}There's nothing much I can|tell you about this war.
{180220}{180323}It's like all wars, I suppose.
{180326}{180406}The undertakers are winning it.
{180408}{180541}The politicians talk a|lot about the glory of it.
{180543}{180658}And the old men will|talk about the need of it.
{180715}{180827}The soldiers, they just wanna go home.
{180965}{181168}I guess you're not so lonely|now, Martha, with James and Ann...
{181171}{181237}and Jacob.
{181240}{181317}And maybe the Boy.
{181380}{181564}You didn't know Ann, did|you? Well, you'll like her.
{181567}{181773}You'll like her a lot, Martha. Why,|she and James are so much alike.
{181776}{181901}They're just like we... No.
{181941}{182126}We were never that much alike,|were we, Martha? We just sort of...
{182128}{182232}We just sort of grew|alike through the years.
{182263}{182343}But... I-I wish...
{182458}{182643}I wish I could just know what|you're thinking about it all, Martha.
{182677}{182787}Then maybe things|wouldn't look so bad to me.
{182789}{182902}If I only knew what you thought.
{183213}{183272}Ah, you...
{183274}{183359}You never give up, do you?
{183757}{183886}Thought you'd get away with it, huh? Why|didn't one of you tell me it was Sunday?
{183888}{183988}Now, come on, get|cleaned up. We're late.
{184031}{184107}- You have something to say?|- No, sir.
{184109}{184219}Well, then, saddle your|horses. Get my carriage.
{184413}{184589}#... goods and kindred go
{184592}{184794}# This mortal life also
{184797}{185013}# The body they may kill
{185016}{185235}# God's truth abideth still
{185238}{185529}# His kingdom is forever
{185532}{185714}# Amen
{185867}{185957}For our second hymn...
{186082}{186182}For our second hymn,|we'll turn to page...
{186334}{186389}How long, O Lord?
{186552}{186672}With God's help, we'll turn to page...
{187464}{187549}Shall we all rise and sing?
{187586}{187789}# Praise God, from|whom all blessings flow
{187792}{188013}# Praise Him, all creatures here below
{188016}{188237}# Praise Him above, ye heavenly host
{188239}{188505}# Praise Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Come on, Throw the dice.
Let's arm wrestle.
For what?
The looser will have to beat the first man coming in.
Allright.
Please stop. Since you are here the kismet of my shop has ended.
You are beating every body down.
You are lucky. He is thin as a toothpick.
If you had eaten you would have cleaned your teeths with it.
If you want give me five bill I beat him for you.
You want to drink wine or cause trouble?
Forgive me my friend, you look like a good man but I have to beat you down.
Come on, beat me.
Ok?
- Selamunaleykum. -Aleykum selam.
Ahmet Can was it Seyyit Han?
You are wrong Seyyit Han died years ago.
Seyyit! Seyyit!
They said you died, shot down but me I didn't belived them. I said Seyyit don't die.
Is there a wedding at Yenice?
Who's?
Mister Haydar's.
I was sent by Emin the butcher from
Belveren. They saw Seyyit Han this morning.
Go quickly and tell Mister Haydar the butcher said.
Thank you My frend. Ali take him some food and drink to our friend.
So he didn't die. Will he cause an incident?
One never knows. Go to Mursit, tell him
Seyyit is back. I am waiting behind
Celemli.
They have waited a long time for you son a very long time.
But when they said "Seyyit Han has been shot, Seyyit Han died" that Keje threw herself in the well. They saved her with difficulty.
She was ill for three years Keje, of sorrow.
But after she couldn't resist the insistences of his father.
Mursit gave her to Mister Haydar as daughter.
You have a job to do son, to go back where you come as silently as you came.
Uncle Hidayet do I look like a man who will leave his lover behind?
- Am I a man who would accept his destiny? - No you are not my Seyyit.
No you are not son. However, don't mess things up. Mursit made a promise.
I don't care. Mursit gave his word to me first.
He said "I will give you my sister Keje but you have to get rid of all your enemies."
I fought seven years to not leave a bride in tears behind me.
I waited all these years for Keje.
My sides are rotten by doing time. Now I am free. All my enemies are dead.
- If there is no choice I will take her and go. - This is impossible, son.
If Keje wants there is nothing impossible.
Ready the horses.
I'll hope you pardon me son. But I didn't understood this, what does it mean?
This is my cuffin. A man like me never knows where he will die.
- Mmmm, and the money? - If I die abroad it's for my cuffin.
- An this, it's some medecine? - Yes.
- Will it cease headeachs? - Yes it will cease all pains.
Seyyit, Mursit is coming. Mursit is coming.
Selamunaleykum
Aleykum selam.
You are welcome, Seyyit Han. I know you will trust me.
Hidayet saw our situation. We gave our word that you are died.
To have a sister is a difficult thing.
I gave my sister Keje as a bride to Mister
Haydar.
They have their wedding today. At Yenice.
You are as my brother Seyyit Han, don't do wrong.
Don't embarass me to my friends and enemies.
Do you remeber what you promised me years ago Mursit?
- Yes I do. - So Keje is mine, you promised me.
Yes you are back but you came late.
I came back Mursit. I risked my life for her.
I won against all my enemies.
Even if there will be blood in the end your sister Keje is mine.
Keje won't be your wife. Forget her.
- We we'll go far away together. - You can't do anything while I am alive.
And Keje, she won't flee with you. Talk to her if you want.
I will talk to her.
At dawn.
Keje, come my sister, let's talk a little bit.
Keje, your brother Mursit is in a very difficult situation.
Why?
Seyyit Han has come back Keje.
He's back? Where is he?
With Uncle Hidayet.
Keje, my sister. You are a girl whom feets are tied.
- You are the bride of Mister Haydar. -No I am not. I am nothing.
Don't shout! We will be disgraced. We could'nt look to anyone.
Seyyit is not dead, brother. He has come back for me.
Yes, he is back for you.
I will leave. I will go to the other side of the world with him.
I don't want anything from you.
We are late Keje. The drums are playing for you.
It's your wedding. I know we did wrong but how could we know.
Don't think I would have done a such thing if I knew?
- You know how i like Seyyit. -And you don't like your sister Keje?
You feel sore during festivities for the sheeps being sacrificed.
Would you sacrifice your sister?
This is a no end street. I don't know what to do.
This is a disagree. You tell me what I should do.
I can't say anything. Brother, let me go.
Don't stand my way.
Go my sister. I won't hold you. I will kill myself. I have no other choice.
The honor of our family is at your hands
Keje. Do what seems you the right thing.
To night Seyyit Han will come to talk to you.
Son, aren't you mistaken? You are describing a dead man.
Dead?
The man you say is a very courageus man.
The one you talk about is Seyyit Han?
Seyyit Han?
Yes Seyyit Han! Who would have believed he will die.
- It'time. Should we go? - Let's go.
Who was that Seyyit Han's lover.
Do you hear the drums? At that village, at
Yenice.
Keje and Mister Haydar is getting married.
If Seyyit Han was alive would Keje be the bride of Mister Haydar?
- Never, Keko knows well Seyyit Han. -I know him very well.
The first time Seyyit Han came I was a watchman, at Malatya.
He was thin and courageous.
One couldn't look in his eyes, one would be scared.
He was a friend of Mister Mursit. They liked each other very much.
A courageous man has many enemies son.
Seyyit had many enemies.
But he wouldn't care. Until the time he saw
Keje
She looked at him and he fell in love with her. So was Keje.
Days had passed, months have passed
Seyyit couldn't resist he said to Mursit
"I am not a deshonorable man. But something happened to me.
A fire is burning my heart."
I would like to marry Keje with Allah's consent and your grants"
Mister Mursit knew that Seyyit Han had many enemies.
"Brother, he said, my sister is still a child, and the only sister of one brother.
I like you very much. But I don't give my sister to a man followed by bullets."
But he knew that her sister was also in love with Seyyit so he said
"I will give my sister to you but you have to many foes
They can kill you tomorrow, and Keje will be a widow.".
"Get rid of your enemies and she will be yours I promise." He said.
With this Seyyit Han leaved at dawn. We never heard about him for a long time.
They said he was in prison. And one day we heard that he was dead. Shot.
I have come to take you Keje.
But I heard that they give you as bride to
Mister Haydar.
Did they told the truth?
They told the truth.
Is this hoe we agreed? I would wait for you five feet under.
You stand wing broken and with tears in your eyes Keje, do they have your will?
You should tell me the truth Keje.
I resisted to all sort of pain for you. I came across big mountains for you.
You must tell me the truth.
What should I say Seyyit Han? What? I have a mouth but no tongue.
Am the only sister of a single brother. I am the honor of the family.
Go to find you someone else. Allah should keep your sword sharp and your way open.
Go. Our time has passed. What should I say?
- These words are from your mouth
Keje? -Yes.
Is your heart tells the same?
Yes, the same.
I endured great sufferings Keje, a lot. But the most unbeareble is this one.
I am leaving Keje. May God make you happy.
May the Lord not show me your pain.
Forgive me sister.
Seyyit, Seyyit.
Keje, sister you finish what you have started.
Seyit!
What's happening son?
The world had changed, there is no one left to trust.
What did Keje said?
"Our time has passed she said. Did she tell right or wrong I don't know.
Destiny...
This is not destiny, this is a harlot game
Uncle Hidayet.
I should have not come back. I should have died.
A courageous man don't quickly search shelter in death, son.
What should I do Uncle? I survived seven years by dreaming of Keje.
Hoping to settle down like everybody else.
I must go. I must leave this place. If not I will be disgraced here.
I would take Keje, and be a bandit.
Being a bandit is not you. Don't lose your hope.
We, four friends, want to become your men.
Why have you come to me and not to someone else?
- Because we have the same enemy. -The same enemy?
Seyyit Han.
Thank you friends. The wedding is over.
Now everybody to their homes.
Would a young bride be with a wounded heart and with tears in his eyes?
Do you care of my wounded heart or my eyes full of tears Mister Haydar?
- I am your wife. - Without consenting?
Yes.
You should not have come to me.
I am the honor of a Man Mister Haydar. I am the honor of the family.
I am also a Man. I don't want a bride without her consent.
I love someone else. But I am here in front of your eyes.
They sacrificed me for you Mister Haydar, what should I do?
If I let you go, would you go to Seyyit
Han?
No I can't. My brother gave his word. I could not dishonor him.
I am a master. My bride should be*****
You should have thought about it Mister
Haydar. You have not met me today.
This is not a secret.
I did wrong. Very wrong. But I won't continue doing it.
- I will take you to Seyyit Han as a bride.
- Would it be the right to a man?
Yes it will. God accepted your wish.
My wish is not to go but to die right now
Mister Haydar.
Dying, dying is easy Keje.
I have to get rid of you.
You must die, one must get rid of you.
What's happening?
Nothing. Empty the village tomorrow morning. Send the guests.
Immediatly
Are you leaving son?
It's the morning. Keje is gone, hope is over.
To who Keje belonged, to who she belongs?
It's time to go. It's time to forget everything and go.
Take care of you son.
Thanks, they played with us, they made us bad.
It is all about destiny. You have nothing to do.
- Will my sorrow ease? -It will.
It won't. Can a man with brokenheart survive?
He can't. Goodbye
With healthiness...
Uncle Hidayet! Uncle Hidayet!
Look inside.
Uncle Hidayet! Uncle Hidayet!
There is no Seyyit Han neither there is
Hidayet Emmi.
You didn't become my pride and you can't be the bride of any body.
You are going to be the bride of the earth.
It's better to be the bride of the earth then to be a bride like this.
Dig her grave.
Do you have something to tell me, Keje?
What can I say Mister Haydar? I guess it's my destiny, what should I say?
Yes it's destiny, and it's a bad one.
Seyyit! Seyyit! Seyyit!
Seyyit! Seyyit! Seyyit!
Seyyit! Seyyit!
Are we going to leave her like this?
I will not leave. I am going to wait for
Seyyit Han.
Seyyit Han! Seyyit Han!
I was waiting for you.
It's not a good sign for any one when you wait Haydar.
I am not a master but a gentleman.
I am son of a gentleman. I am Master
Haydar.
And me, I am no master, no gentleman, I am Seyyit Han.
One should keep his things for him
Gentleman Haydar.
I am a gentleman.
If you were a real son of gentleman you wouldn't marry a girl who loves someone else. You should have let her.
I will. But I have a condition.
We are going to race with you. For Keje.
The one is the winner gets her.
Where is she?
She is an safe place.
There is a bird in that three, you see?
I see.
If you shoot that bird between his eyes.
It's a little sparrow and me I am a Seyyit
Han.
You killed many men. You think of killing a sparrow?
If a man claims my life, if a man claims my bread...
If a man challenges my honor, I kill him.
She is a little sparrow. She seeks a branch for her.
I can't shoot a bird in the eye. There is no way we are going to battle.
What do you want?
There is a basket there, you see?
I see.
There is a flower on it you see?
I see.
Can you shoot at the center of the flower?
If you can Keje is yours if not she is mine.
What happened Seyyit Han? You can't do it?
I don't have to shoot then... She's yours...
- Where is Keje? - She's inside.
Keje! Keje!
Seyyit! Seyyit!
Keje! Keje!
Mursit Agha! Mursit Agha!
What's happening?
Seyyit Han killed Keje.
Ha!
You are not the man you looked to be
Seyyit Han.
You are not a child of a human. I should have killed you when you got back.
How can you do this? Pull your gun so I can shoot you.
Can I kill your sister Keje, Mursit? Can I kill her?
Who killed her?
You, your promise.
You must tell me the truth. Wait, Seyyit
Han, Wait!
If you don't I'll shoot you.
Wait, Mursit don't be a fool. It's Seyyit Han who shot Keje it's true.
But he did it without knowing. They played him a devilish game, son.
They did it to make you foes.
Keje paid all of your mistakes.
How was she shot Keje?
At the time we got there she was burried her head in basket.
They battled with Mister Haydar.
When we realised what's going on Seyyit became mad at him.
That big man cried until no tears came out.
He prayed all night to God to give Keje life.
Mursit is in this side.
Mursit is in that side.
I think they shot someone.
What's happening, what's happening?
Seyyit Han is coming, Seyyit Han!
Seyyit Han is here! Seyyit Han is here!
Seyyit Han is here!
I am going to bring you Seyyit Han's head.
I shot him but he didn't care.
- Where? - At his flank, I shot him at his flank.
You stupid. A man wounded at his flank can't walk.
Mursit!
Keje, I asked your brother to marry you
But he didn't gave his permission.
You are an eagle Seyyit Han. And me a little sparrow. Take me and go.
I have my wing broken. I can't take the sister of a friend like this.
He afraid that you become a widow if you're with me.
Keje, will you wait for me?
Where would you go? You're foes, they'll shoot you.
You're foes, they will shot you. Take me away,
No, Mursit is right. I know I have to go.
I know I have a lot of enemies.
If I am alive I will come back, Keje. If I go in jail will you wait for me?
If I go far away will you wait for my return?
I am a little branch Seyyit. I will wait if I don't dry out.
I will wait if flowers grow on the ground above me.
I will wait if grass grow above me.
I am leaving Keje. Take this bullet, keep it.
I leave you with yourself.
Seyyit... Seyyit...
Do everything just like I told you, old man, and you'll live to make some more of these bone boxes.
Open the gates!
Hey, Jonas!
Hope you made 'em extra long.
We got a couple of big ones.
Bring 'em out.
Keep cool, old man.
Graber, look at that.
Ned Cawley, Frank Graber...
Joe Maxwell, Jesse Barton.
You've been found guilty of murder in the first degree...
...by the people of the territory of Arizona and on this thirteenth day of January in the year of Our Lord 1891...
I am hereby ordered by this warrant to have you... hanged until dead.
You boys wanna make a...
You boys wanna make a statement?
Hurry it up, fat boy.
We have a date in hell for dinner.
Shut up.
Why don't you go...
Hang the warden, hang the warden, hang the warden, hang the warden...
Shut up!
Shut up in there!
Quiet! Cut it out!
Shut up in there!
This one's holding on.
Can't last much longer, though.
You're gonna see a lot of men hang before you get out of here, Wes.
Oh, yeah?
You've been good to me in this hole, Cain, and I like you.
But let me tell you this.
I ain't gonna sit in here for 18 years and rot like you did.
No pen can hold
Luke Santee's brother.
You'll see.
It's all done.
Bring out the wagon.
Swing the wagon over to the gallows.
I'm gonna fill these things up.
They're already filled!
Come on, Luke, over here!
Luke, Luke, come on down this way.
Here I am!
- Hurry up!
- Damn it! Come on down here, Luke!
You've each got six shells apiece, boys.
Make 'em count!
Come on, Luke!
Boy, am I glad to see you, Luke!
Go for the gate!
Go for the gate!
Gimme the gun!
Go for the gate!
Come on, Cain.
We can use a man like you.
Don't do it, kid, even if you make it out of here, they'll get you.
Wes!
Hank, get over here!
Cain... you bastard!
You dirty bastard!
Cain's a rehabilitated man.
Well, that's a credit to you and your institution, Warden.
Oh, no, it's a credit to Cain.
And that's why the court saw fit to release him.
Cain will never pick up a gun again.
The hell he won't!
He'll have to.
Cain spent half his life right there in the cell where loud mouth is standing.
Cain was a tough kid when he came here in '73.
Now he's a mellowed man with dreams of making an honest life for himself.
Do you have any idea where he might have gone?
Why don't you try Las Rinas?
It's the nearest town.
Hey, look out!
Bobby?
Bobby, bring those crates right over here.
- Can I help you?
- No.
Hey, whatcha doin', mister?
I'm just looking, son.
Never seen you around here before.
You just passing through?
I don't know.
Are you a cowboy?
No.
- A miner?
- Nope.
It's Ruffalo!
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Step right up.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
See the spectacular shootin' show and death display.
See the world's greatest gunslinger.
His firearm's first fiddle, folks.
He's a sharp one, folks.
He's a shootin' shark!
And see the world-famous collection of macabre curios inside.
The little lump of lead that was removed from Jesse James' back.
And the number noose that nicked Nick Norris's nasty nape!
It's the biggest little show in the territory.
And no lesser person than the great
Mr. Twain himself said, "It's the best!"
All right, step right up, ladies and gentlemen.
Now here's your change, sir.
Thank you very much.
All right, thank you, go right in.
There's plenty of room for everybody.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of the best shows you've ever seen in your life.
There you go, two of you.
Enjoy yourself.
Thank you very much.
Don't miss the shootin', kid.
Don't miss the death display!
Betcha never thought you'd see that again, did you, Cain?
No, I...
I never did.
I won it in a poker game.
I heard you were gettin' out and...
Well, I hoped that our paths might cross.
I figured you might be lookin' for a job.
Well, I am, mister, but...
Not Mr. Butt, Mr. Ruffalo.
Dan Ruffalo.
Listen, Cain,
I have a proposition for you.
If your proposition involves this,
I ain't interested.
Oh, now, don't be so hasty, man.
I think you might like what I have to say. Sit down.
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.
I know how tough it is for guys like you to find a job.
It's a shame folks feel the way they do about people who've served a little time, but, well, it's a fact.
And I might help you.
What do you mean?
Well, I've got a pretty good little business drummed up in this here territory.
You can hear that.
Billy and me, we make pretty good money.
And the work ain't hard and...
Well, I kinda figured you might have a hankering to... join up with us.
What do you need me for?
Well, you know, I kinda figured that folks might enjoy seeing Killer...
There, you see?
I almost said Killer Cain, well, damn it all, I did say it.
Killer Cain.
I think people might really have something to talk about if they could...
Well, if they could see you...
...using this notched Colt of yours.
Yeah, I see what you mean, but...
No, thanks.
I know you mean well, but I just ain't interested.
There's good money in it.
I just don't want to be around guns, mister.
I think you can understand why.
Well, what do you figure on doing then?
Oh, I don't know, I...
I'll find work.
Cain, listen to me.
The West is... a lot different than it was back in '73, when you were part of it.
A whole lot different.
The railroad and the telegraph, they've changed everything... or almost everything.
The only fact that you can be sure of is that you're Cain.
A man to be feared.
Certainly not trusted.
No, it's gonna be real rough for you to find a job.
It is for all ex-cons.
Well, maybe you've noticed that men don't wear guns anymore, unless they're on the road.
No, things have settled down out here.
And that makes for a lot of...
Easterners coming out west.
And there ain't enough jobs for them.
Let alone, you.
I hope you're wrong, mister.
I ain't.
They didn't like me, they love me.
Billy.
This here is Killer Cain.
This is...
This is the man, right here?
The genuine article.
Thanks for the drink, Ruffalo.
I guess I better get going and find some work.
Sorry we couldn't make a deal.
Say, I'm sure glad to have met you.
All right, men, form a group.
Right around here.
I need four men only.
Big and strong.
You, there.
You.
You.
You there with no hat on.
I'm sorry, Cain, it's... it's company policy.
Let's go, men.
Hey, mister.
I see you're looking for work.
- I sure am.
- See that wagon?
Two bucks if you drive it to Cragston's mine.
Put the stuff inside, and I'll give you another two bucks when you get back.
You know where it's that?
You just point me in the right direction.
Morning!
I wanna be able to do this again.
You're gonna have it a lot rougher out than you did in.
Hello!
Anybody here?
I just needed a little water. I...
I didn't mean any harm.
I hollered but nobody answered.
I...
I guess I don't look too good.
I had a little accident.
May I?
There's some rags in back there, too.
My name's Cain.
Just Cain.
Justin Cain?
No, ma'am.
Just...
Only Cain.
What happened to you?
Well...
I guess you could say I got fired.
You're going back to... Las Rinas?
Dry Wood.
I came out here this morning.
Be going back as soon as I finish my painting.
They say this town was abandoned when the stage line stopped making its run.
Guess you know all about that.
That does it for today.
- That sure is good.
- Thank you.
I was wondering, miss, if I... could ride in with you?
To Dry Wood?
We'll make a deal.
You help me get my supplies in the buckboard, I'll get you into Dry Wood.
Yes, ma'am.
By the way, my name is Monica Alton.
Things have changed around here, haven't they?
Yes, ma'am, they sure have.
That's why I'm out here.
I'm doing a series.
Not just sketches, but paintings, as well.
I hope to capture pictorially what Bret Harte and Mark Twain were able to put into words.
"Local color," if you know what I mean.
No, ma'am,
I can't says I do.
There's no reason why you should.
Well, you've got local color, you belong out here.
You have a very interesting face.
I'd like to paint it some time.
Who are you?
I told you, my name's Cain.
I mean, what do you do?
I didn't mean to pry.
It's really none of my business.
I don't blame you for wondering.
Why don't we... get moving and we can talk about it on the way to dinner.
- Is that an invitation?
- Yes, ma'am. I've got two...
What's the matter?
Well, I had two dollars.
I guess I not only got fired,
I got robbed.
I went to Vassar.
That's a school back east for women.
I detested it.
So of course I didn't do very well in my studies.
I flunked out.
But I didn't care, anyway.
'Cause all I wanted to do was come out west and paint.
My father thought
I was running away from failure.
He tried to encourage me by saying that it wasn't what happened in the past that mattered, it was the future.
You're trying to encourage me by... telling me that I should forget my past.
Well, I'd like to, but... it seems like most people remember too hard.
Why do you help them?
I don't understand.
Why did you tell me your name?
Why didn't you say it was Crane, or something else?
It isn't what people think you are that matters. It's what you are.
Would you promise an intuitive woman something?
I'll make a deal with you.
If you say yes,
I'll treat you to that dinner.
- You sure like to make deals.
- Well?
Well, it sounds mighty tempting, but...
You can pay me back later.
Say it's a deal.
All right. It's a deal.
Why don't you get out of here?
Why hang around small towns where people will remember?
Go east or north to a city like Prescott.
- That's Killer Cain.
- I know.
I I heard he was here in Dry Wood a couple months back.
This winter.
Do you... happen to know where he went?
No.
It's getting dark in here.
I never saw Cain.
I bought that sketch off of Joe Kirby over at the boarding house.
Some girl left it behind when she decided to move on.
Round and round she goes, and where she stops nobody knows.
Two to one, gentlemen.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Sorry, place your bets now.
Place your bets.
Last chance.
- Night, Justin.
- Good night, Bruce.
All right, folks.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Step right up and see the spectacular shooting show and death display.
See the world's greatest gunslinger.
He's sharp.
He's a shootin' shark.
So step right up and get your tickets here, ladies and gentlemen.
Justin.
He sure is loud.
There's a kid in there that's pretty good with a gun.
You've seen the show?
A couple of months ago in Las Rinas.
...show, and the death display, ladies and gentlemen.
Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
Yes, sir, you can place your bets.
Place your bets.
Round and round she goes and where she stops nobody knows.
Everybody down.
Place your bets.
She's stopping.
Two to one!
Here you are, here you are, thank you.
Thank you, young lady.
Everybody down.
Place your bets, all right?
You know what I want, Jim.
Right away, Sheree.
- Could I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.
How's that thing work?
I don't know much about that.
It's simple.
Why don't you come over when
I'm on the wheel and I'll show you.
Oh, I...
That would be fine.
I sure would like you to do that.
Anytime.
Say, aren't you that kid from the shooting show?
I'm the star.
Well, I didn't see the show, but I sure heard it.
You did?
Say, honey, you sure do make a lot of noise.
Fix me a drink.
Sorry, son.
I got a tough boss.
All I can serve you is a sarsaparilla.
- A... a what?
- Sarsaparilla.
You kidding me?
There's nothing I can do, they made it a law.
I see, they made it a law.
Well, look, I'm not interested in a civics lesson, mister.
I'd just appreciate if you'd just fix me a drink, there.
Can't you read?
Let's see.
"No minor persons served."
Now, I can read that sign, but I don't believe it.
I would appreciate it if you would not worry so much about my schooling and tell your hands to do their stuff or I'll blow 'em off your wrists!
You got any ideas about using that gun in here, son, forget it.
Cain!
"Cain"?
What are you talking about, kid?
That man's name is Justin.
I don't know about that.
That... that's Cain. That is Mr. Cain.
"Killer Cain." l... I was just playing, just messing around, you know.
I sure wouldn't mess with you.
I sure wouldn't mess with Killer Cain, would you?
That's Killer Cain.
That's Killer Cain.
Cain? Or is it Justin?
I witnessed you at work tonight.
I told you it would be tough finding a job.
Like you said, you witnessed me at work. I got a job.
But how long did it take?
You know, I've been in a lot of those... those towns where you've been in the past few months.
And I... well, I know how hard it's been for you.
I ain't complaining.
No, you didn't complain when you were slopping pigs in Bisbee or cleaning spittoons in Tulsa.
Oh, let's face it, man, you weren't even able to hold those jobs, and you won't be able to hold this one, either.
I told you once before.
I ain't interested in your proposition.
All right.
I just wanted to let you know the offer still stands, if and when.
Billy and me'll be pulling out of here in the morning, for Redrock.
In case you change your mind.
And I was so cock-sure that I could get Cain to join up with us.
I thought he'd be tired of those chicken feed jobs by now.
Listen, we are doing all right, Rufe.
Good as folks say he was...
How much better could he be than me?
If only you hadn't lied to him in the first place.
Why didn't you just tell him who you were?
You know, he probably wouldn't have cared if you had leveled with him right from the beginning.
And why did you say your name was Justin?
It's a long story, Sheree...
Good-bye and thanks again.
For what?
For trying.
Good-bye.
Well, it looks like everything's in place.
- Your offer still stand?
- Sure!
We were just about to pull out.
Billy, lock up that wagon.
You come with me, Cain.
All right, Billy, let's get rolling.
I gotta stop over at my place and get my gear.
Eighteen years in prison made me think I'd never touch another gun.
That gun's gonna earn you a lot of money, Cain.
Good money.
Yeah, yeah, it sure will.
I bet you're pretty... pretty good with that.
What I love are those 12 notches.
- Those were the good old days.
- How would you know?
I've heard.
I've heard how every man would wear a gun and if he wanted to have it out with a guy, why, he did.
Today you're lucky if you can get a guy outside to fist-fight.
Here, load up.
I'll... see if I can trim that branch back a little.
Looks like I need some practice.
I never miss.
Well, Cain, you just got yourself a free show.
Now, I know what you're doing there, you're holding back, aren't you?
- No.
- Yes, you are.
I know you killed 12 men. I know you must have been sharper than that.
I was.
How'd you do it?
How'd you kill 'em, I mean?
Different men, different ways.
"Different men, different ways"?
But you always let 'em draw first, right?
No.
Not if there was a chance
I might get beat.
The only code I had was to let 'em know I was coming.
But you never bushwhacked anyone, did you?
Well, like I said, they knew
I was coming, so they all had guns and none of them got it in the back.
Well, see, I thought...
You thought that
I marched down the street, called 'em out and waited for 'em to draw?
No, Billy, I...
I was hired to use my gun and I did.
Well, l...
I'd let anyone draw first.
'Cause I can outdraw anyone.
It's... it's hard for me to believe that you never were as good as I am.
Good at what,
Billy, hitting branches?
Or killing men?
There is a difference.
Eighteen years ago a man never holstered an unloaded gun.
You're just playing games, kid.
Let me ask you something.
How old were you when you killed your first man?
- Sixteen.
- Sixteen.
What was he?
A sheriff or a marshal or what?
- Soldier.
- Soldier?
How much you get paid?
I didn't get paid anything.
It happened in a fist-fight.
Oh, well.
No, I mean, what about when you had that first notch on your Colt?
What about it?
I didn't get paid anything for that, either.
I killed a bounty hunter who was after my hide.
Well, the first time you got paid, how much?
Fifty bucks don't mean much to him, Cain.
He's spoiled.
He don't know what it was like out here in those days.
Well, it was different.
A lot different.
My father was a sergeant in the Fourth Cavalry, and they were always out chasing Indians.
I never saw much of anything except the inside of army forts till I killed that soldier.
All my life I'd seen men die.
The ones that lived brag about killing others, so life was cheap to me.
And $50 was a lot of money.
Especially when you were on the run.
Yeah, you make it sound lousy.
It was.
Hell, I just wish... I just wish
I'd been living in those days.
'Cause the way
I handle a gun, boy, I'll tell ya.
The way you handle a gun, you'd been a dead man.
Somebody would have shot you in the back because they were afraid to face up to you.
That's the way it was, and don't you think different.
Mr. Cain.
How come... no one went for your back?
It's a big enough target.
Well, a fella did once, but his aim was low.
I got a scar on my ass to prove it.
Here, try that on, for a start.
Go on, man, put it on.
Put it on.
Yeah, it looks good.
It looks good.
Everything's gonna be black.
Black Stetson, black bandana.
Everything black but the silver.
Here, a black jacket, black jacket, black pants...
Look at this.
Look at that buscadero belt.
Ain't that snazzy, huh?
It's just what a killer's supposed to wear, ain't it, Cain?
I guess so, but... I sure never wore nothing like that.
Well, think maybe we better try some of this on, huh?
We might have to make some alterations.
You're a big son of a bitch.
Look, here's some black boots.
Killer Cain. Killer Cain.
We stay here for a couple of days, and then we'll hit Tempe, and Phoenix, and Higginsville and Liberty, and... by the end of the month we'll be in Valseco.
Mornin', Linus.
Seen The Epitaph?
Well, something in here I think, uh, will interest you.
Says Cain's coming back to town.
According to the article, Cain's been with Dan Ruffalo's shootin' show for almost a month.
He'll be here today or tomorrow.
Ha kee.
I thought we made a deal.
Hi.
I want you to know I tried.
I believe you.
Oh, I'm not kiddin' myself.
I know it's not the best life, but... it's better than anything
I've ever known.
Then I'm happy for you.
I better go finish my sketch.
It was nice seeing you again.
Wait a minute.
I owe you these.
I had a feeling I'd get these back.
Be seein' ya.
Be seeing you.
All right, folks, step right up.
It's the biggest little show in the territory.
Hurry, hurry, hurry. Thank you, sir.
I hope you enjoy yourself.
Step inside, folks, and see the spectacular shootin' show, starring the infamous Killer Cain.
Step right inside, ladies and gentlemen, if you dare, and let the Killer show you the 12 notches on his Colt and how they got there.
All right, folks, step right up.
Come on, folks, you got a treat inside. Let... what...
What the hell are you doin'?
All this shouting about "The Killer," "The Killer".
Now, look...
Listen to me.
- Billy, calm yourself.
- Now, you should listen to me.
You said that I was the star.
I was the star!
Billy, this is my show, and I'll bark what I damn well please.
Now you get your butt back in there and do what I pay you to do.
Go on, git, git!
All right, folks, I know you don't wanna miss this spectacular event.
Here's your change, sir, thank you very much and...
Carson?
I'm glad to see you!
You come to see the Killer?
You know, I think you and I might work something out.
What are you getting at?
Well, seein' as how you and Cain have met before and right out here,
I think folks might, uh, well, they might enjoy seeing a little... encore.
I'll make it worth your while.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, step right up, let me see the color of your money.
Mr. Cain, would you take a challenge?
Three shots apiece for a dollar?
Sure.
It looked easy.
Well, thanks anyway.
It sure would have been great if I could have said I'd beat you.
I'm the best shot in town, Cain.
You wanna take me on for a dollar?
Well, I guess we can't see the Killer back down.
There you go.
Son of a bee!
Cain... best of six... on the wheel.
Three out of six.
Six out of six.
Can't beat that.
Mr. Cain, what'll you have?
Well, I'll try some of that rye.
All right.
Say, here, it's the next one, right here, that's on me.
And, uh... you can pour me... pour me the same.
At least I don't see any signs around that says I can't, do you?
Thanks.
Listen, I was... was going to ask you something...
Oh, yeah. What do you... what do you think about Rufe?
He's a good man.
Yeah, well, that's...
That's what I thought at first, too.
I really did.
But l... I don't think so now.
When I first met him, he was... he was moving about the territory, doin' nothing, I mean, he was selling guns, but folks weren't buying 'em.
Course, then one day he sees me.
And I'm... you know, shooting bottles off the fence, you know how I shoot.
Well, he gets the idea of trying to drum up a little business with me showing off his hardware, so I said, "All right," I said,
"I'll go with you, I'll go along with you."
And one thing led to another.
After a couple of months, he stopped selling guns and began selling admissions to see me shoot.
It seems to me, he's been pretty good to you.
Hell, but not good enough, not good enough, shoot!
He treats you a helluva lot better than he does me!
And I've known him a lot longer than you, and I'm a helluva lot better with a gun than you.
See, what I don't figure is how he could bark to townsfolk that I am a shootin' shark, but forget himself that I could blow him apart if I got the urge.
See, people ought to realize that the same thing I do to those targets
I could... I could do to them.
You're talking awful big, Billy.
Draw against me.
What?
You heard me.
Draw your gun.
You see, when you are a little bit afraid and not quite sure of yourself, even the fastest gun can be beat.
Things are different when the target can shoot back.
You remember that.
You're still playing.
Yeah, well, you just stand up and try that again.
I couldn't do that, Billy.
You're dead.
Well...
I've waited a long time, Cain.
Carson.
I was wondering when I drove in here this morning if you might still be around.
Get up.
No.
Why don't you sit down?
I'm calling you outside, Cain.
Go on, Cain!
Last time I stepped outside with a lawman, it cost me 18 years of my life.
I can't afford any more time.
You forget I'm not a lawman any more.
And I'm not a gunfighter.
You owed your life.
A court settled for 18 years, Carson.
Eighteen years don't pay for all them murders.
So maybe you paid for one, but you got a dozen notches on your Colt.
I'm a free man, Carson.
I don't want any trouble from you or any other man.
I would've paid you for that performance this afternoon, Carson.
You just didn't have what it takes
20 years ago.
Twenty years ago, Cain was young and fast, like the kid here.
But now he's older and slower, like I was when he called me.
When he called you?
He didn't call you, Carson, and you didn't go out willingly.
You were forced into that shootout.
Forced? I was the Marshall!
The way I heard it, the people of this town forced you.
You're a liar, Ruffalo.
Oh? Somebody stop me if I'm wrong.
- Now, there's no need to...
- No one forced me!
The thought that Cain was here in Valseco back in '71 sent a chill through this town.
I knew he was here to kill.
- Yes, but nobody knew who.
- I was the Marshall!
So they shoved you out of that door to stop Cain before they could find out.
- I did my duty!
- And he winged you.
Because of that, your marshalin' days were over.
No one forced me!
Now you know that Cain could have killed you that day.
Lucky for you that he just went for your shoulder.
Now, you listen to me, man.
Forget about that revenge, hear?
I'll buy you a drink.
Come on,
I'll buy everybody a drink.
Say, Rufe, who did he come gunnin' for?
Oh, some cattleman.
Yeah, yeah, but did he get him?
Does an outhouse stink?
Well, he sure ain't the same man, I tell you.
I was kinda hopin' to see he and that old buzzard get into something.
Oh, that'd been great.
Either way, we would have lost Cain.
Cain?
Makes you feel like a big man, huh?
Travelin' around the territory.
Showing everybody your 12 notches.
I'm not proud of what I was.
Huh? Why else you doin' it?
'Cause it's the only tool I know.
I'm not hurting anybody, and I'm earning an honest living for myself.
Ain't no way for you to be honest, Cain.
No way at all.
I haven't got a gun... or a mind to draw against you.
Cain... here you go!
Well, now, that solves half your problems, don't it?
That's right.
Go ahead, shoot him.
Stick it in your belt, that'll do.
Just stick it in there and just... blow his head off.
Ruffalo claims that I was forced last time.
Well, this time I'm forcing you.
Go ahead, blow it.
- Damn you! Pick up that gun!
- He means it, I tell you.
He almost blew my toe off.
Now pick up the gun.
- Just go ahead and blow his head off.
- Stay out of this, Billy.
Well...
Well, if he... if he won't pick up the gun, just shoot him.
Go ahead and shoot him.
Pick it up, you hear me?!
Now, I tell you, if I were you... if you look at his eyes now...
I would just take hold of this little thing right here and blow his head off!
Listen, if I were you,
I would just right now blow one bullet, right in him, right here.
Right here. Just blow his head off.
Now you want to, don't you?
Don't you want to?
Shut up, you!
He's getting away.
You kill him now.
Now, damn it, you go shoot him in that back!
Why did you let him get away?
I want you to tell me that.
But... no, no, I know. l... I know.
I know you were just... you're just waiting for him to turn around so you can shoot him in the back, weren't you?
See? You don't know that I know that's the way they do!
They... they wait, and then, ah, they... turn around and they shoot them in the back!
That's what they do.
My God...
That's... I know, that's what you waitin' for.
If he... if he would have just... got this gun!
Damn near as crazy as you are.
You... you just seek him, you know, you just pick it up and go pow!
Cain?
It is Cain.
You livin' around here?
I have my own place now.
- Still painting?
- Still painting.
You still look hungry and beat, just like the first time I saw you.
What happened with the shooting show?
Oh, I left.
Are you sure you weren't fired again?
I need help unloading my buckboard.
It's filled with a month's supply of shopping.
Your services for all you can eat?
Is it a deal?
It's a deal.
If you'll unload the stuff,
I'll get supper ready.
I haven't eaten that good in a long time. Thanks.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Your face is so difficult to draw!
It's so complicated!
Like my life.
And yours.
Why mine?
Well, it seems to me this is a hard life for a lady like you.
Must be a reason you live like this.
- Like what?
- Alone.
The only reason is because I like it this way.
Heaven knows I don't have to.
Don't you miss those big cities back east?
No. I was born out here.
My father came out here in '49, first gold rush.
Took him ten years, he finally struck it rich.
So did my father.
Came looking for gold, I mean.
What happened?
The only gold he got was three chevrons on his sleeve.
- I mean, what happened to you.
- Me?
I was raised around army forts.
The only time I saw my father was in between details, and usually he was just soberin' up when it was time to leave again.
And then one day he didn't come back.
The Major said he died, but I think he deserted.
What about your mother?
I never saw her, that I remember.
How different...
My father sold his mine interests, packed up my mother and me, and took us back east, where we lived in complete comfort.
Imagine what it would have been like if your father had struck it rich and mine hadn't.
I can't.
Well, l... I guess
I'd better be going.
- Thanks again.
- You're welcome any time, Cain.
What are you doing?
Morning.
Hold that end up, will you?
I thought you left last night.
Well, I started to, but you filled me up so good that I didn't much feel like making the ride back to Las Rinas.
You're lettin' it drag.
Raise it higher.
You know, this place could be fixed up.
The land around here could support stock.
There you are.
I was thinking last night... or maybe I was dreaming, but...
I know I could do something with this place.
That would mean a lot to you, wouldn't it, Cain?
I'd pay you rent as soon as I could.
That wouldn't be good business on my part.
You'd have to pay me first.
- You know I can't do that.
- Oh, yes you can.
Would you please hold still?
I'm sorry, Cain, but it just isn't right.
Damn it, Monica, I'm not posing anymore.
There's work to be done.
If you don't pose, you can clear out.
For Heaven's sake, of course!
- Look, I think I'd better do the shaving.
- No, this is fun!
Mr. Ruffalo.
Mr. Ruffalo!
- Mr. Ruffalo!
- Yeah?
- I'm looking for Cain.
- So am I.
He up and left me a couple of months back.
Would you have any idea where he might have gone?
Who's askin'?
An attorney, huh?
Well, it's like I told you,
I'm looking for him, too.
I think you've made a little mistake here.
Clay Allison died under the wheels of a wagon.
- He was drunk.
- You don't say.
You're an attorney?
Who's got himself hung recently?
Need anything from town?
No. Is that where you're going?
I gotta pick up some nails and a flint.
Say, those flowers are looking great.
Everything around here does.
When will you be back?
I'll be back in time for dinner.
I've been working out there for over a month.
All I can say is I'm sorry, but we require some collateral.
But it's fertile land!
With a small amount of livestock,
I know I could make it a good ranch in no time.
I'm sure you could, but we can't loan you the money.
Because I'm Cain.
To be frank, you'd be a poor risk.
But that's not the main reason.
We ask collateral of everyone.
If Miss Alton would put up her deed on the property, we'd be glad to make the loan for livestock.
No, sir, she's got nothing to do with this.
It's her land.
But it's me that's gonna make something out of it.
Tell me something, Cain, what have you done since you got released?
Possibly I can find some related work for you.
Well, I've had a lot of odd jobs, but only two things that lasted for any length of time.
I was a bouncer, and I did some shooting on a show.
With Ruffalo, of course.
You know Ruffalo?
We loaned him the money to buy that circus wagon of his.
Do you happen to know where he is now?
As a matter of fact,
I ran into him last week in Prescott.
Well, kid, he's back with us, starting tomorrow.
- He is, is he?
- Yeah.
Say, listen, uh, what'd he have to say?
I mean... did he... did he go into, uh, any reasons why he left...
No. No, I didn't ask.
All that matters is that he's back.
And we're gonna start taking in that big money again.
Where's the big box we put the spent shells in?
It's behind the barrel.
Cain?
What'd you come back for?
For money.
Wait.
Did you...
...say anything to Ruffalo about what happened?
No, I didn't.
And I don't intend to.
You know,
I wanna tell you something.
I can't see how both you and me can be in this show.
I was hoping old man Carson would fix things once and for all, but he didn't, so I guess
I'll have to call you myself.
Now go get your gun.
What's the matter, old man?
I'm calling you! Go get your gun.
It's back there on the wagon.
Now go get it!
Go on, old man, go get your gun.
Put that thing away, Billy.
Well, okay, I will put it away.
I will put it away.
It is put away.
'Cause I'm just playing.
Hey, you aren't afraid of a kid who's just playing, are you?
You know, you're right, it doesn't have to be right now.
But it's gonna be.
"Killer."
"Killer Cain."
What'd you do?
You shoot them all on the back?
You're breaking my hand!
You're breaking my hand!
That's right, boy.
I could break your hand right now.
And then where would you be, huh?
Don't you ever try me again.
I've had it with you.
I'll quit this show when I'm damn good and ready.
And the next time you talk to me, you say "Mr. Cain." Understand?
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?
I didn't plan to.
It just worked out that way.
When you didn't come back,
I went in to Las Rinas and asked around.
Bill Grayley at the bank said he thought you might be here.
You don't have to do this, you know?
It's the only way I know to earn money.
I'll stake you.
No. I couldn't do that.
One wouldn't know it, looking at you in that getup.
You're a very proud man.
I love you.
You know that.
And I love you, too.
But please try to understand why I have to do this.
It's not the best way for a man to make a living, but it's honest.
I just want to make enough money to buy some livestock, and then we'll be married.
Who ever would have thought back in Boston...
...l'd be saying "yes" in a cheap hotel room in Arizona...
...to a tall gunslinger in black.
Listen, that's the southbound.
I'll make you a deal.
You catch it, go back to Las Rinas, and I'll come back to you as soon as I can.
It's a deal.
Keep your hands off of that.
That's Cain's share!
That's Cain's share, yeah.
And which one is mine?
Don't tell me!
The little one is mine.
Yes, that's yours.
- Big one is yours.
- That's right.
This is my show, Billy, and I pay a man exactly what he's worth... no more, no less.
It may be your show, but I am the star, and you know it.
You was, Billy, you was, until Cain come along.
Twice as many people are paying to see him.
He's earned his share.
He's earned his share.
I wanna tell you something.
You know why he came back?
He's in here for just one big one.
Then you know what that scarred-assed son of a bitch is gonna do?
He's gonna take a walk!
No, he ain't gonna walk away from all that money, Billy.
The only one who's gonna walk is gonna be you, if you don't like the way
I'm running things.
Hell, I can find me half a dozen sharp shootin' youngsters.
But I'm never gonna be able to find me another Cain.
Hell, you know there's no one better than me.
Maybe not, Billy, maybe not.
But you ain't a killer.
How many times do I gotta tell you, kid?
People want to see a killer.
They pay to see Cain because he's a killer.
Now you... you ain't nothin'.
Just a little pissant.
So that's what I gotta be, huh?
A killer!
All right, Rufe, I'll be a killer.
If that's what I gotta be, I'll be one.
Killer.
Oh, God...
I am a killer, Rufe.
Ruffalo?
I come for my money.
All that yours?
Yeah, it sure is.
That's a lot of money for a kid like you.
I could sure use it.
You know, I don't think that you know who I am.
Nope.
Billy Valen.
I'm Little Boy Blue.
I like that! I really do.
I really like that.
You're a very funny man.
Now, Mr. Funnyman...
Have you heard of, uh...
...Dan Ruffalo's Shooting Show?
I...
...just happen to be the star.
That's right, I'm the star.
Now you say that you can use that, huh?
Is that right?
There it is.
Now, if you think that you can take it, why...
...take it.
Have you ever seen anything that fast?
Didn't anyone ever tell you, boy?
Never holster an empty gun.
You're not... you're not gonna shoot me, are you?
You bet your ass I'm gonna. l... I don't wanna die, mister...
He-help me! Help me...
Now laugh.
Go on, laugh.
Like you did in the mine, uh?
Everything around here looks real nice.
Your husband's done a great job.
Thank you, Mr. Grayley.
We're very happy.
I'm sure you are.
You know, folks up north sort of consider him as a hero for bringing in Luke Santee like he did.
It's ironic, isn't it?
Well, looks like you have company.
I'll be going.
Thank you for dropping by.
- Bye now.
- Bye.
Is your husband around, ma'am?
Why, yes, he's in the back.
Here he comes now.
Hi, there.
What can I do for you?
It's what I can do for you.
I've been looking for you for quite some time.
Why?!
- Why, why?!
- Why?
All right, I'll tell you why.
Because 20 years ago,
Cain killed my father.
He served 18 years in prison.
No, that was the price of one life.
Cain took 12.
Oh, no!
Watch out. That gang's around here.
With what we've got in the cart, 200,000 dollars, we'd better keep our eyes open.
- Here, this will warm you up.
- Great. We can use it.
- I'm going back. You stay on guard.
- Don't worry.
- He goes to his warm house while we...
- Shut up.
- I wish it was tomorrow already.
- Let's have a drink.
- Did you hear anything?
- Yeah, you gurgling down that bottle.
I heard it. Let's go take a look.
Jack? Pat?
No!
John? John!
That's all. Let's go.
Well, let's get going.
Yah! Yah!
15 years, ain't nobody seen you laugh.
I understand.
Ain't no laughing matter to be in jail.
But you can laugh today because today is a big day for you.
But you go out of here with that face, you're gonna be right back again.
Come in.
Come in, Ryan.
It doesn't seem so many years have gone by.
At least, not for you.
It seems only yesterday that we met for the first time.
Here's the 83 dollars you had in your pocket 15 years ago.
Yeah. I hope it helps you get started again.
My gun.
Thank you.
- Now the bullets.
- The bullets?
15 years ago, you put 'em in one of those bottom drawers.
You have a good memory.
Well, sometimes it's not difficult.
I still had 6 in my gun and 21 in my belt.
If they hadn't double-crossed me, the count would be a little bit different.
Here. Beautiful horse, isn't he?
Take it from me, he's worth the 60 dollars.
Hey! Come back here! Hey!
What can I do for you?
I haven't been around here in quite a while.
Everything's changed.
Your parents?
That was my entire family.
I'm sorry.
I heard about it some time ago.
Ah. Hi, Bill.
I'm glad you're in town.
I wanted to speak with you.
I've just been talking to the judge.
How would you like to be deputy sheriff?
The job doesn't pay much, but I'm gonna retire before long and you'll move up a step.
It's time you settled down. I've noticed something between you and Betsy.
I've got other things on my mind, Sheriff, for the time being.
Bill, no one knows you better than me.
I was a good friend of your mother and father.
I know what's on your mind, but don't you think it's time to forget it?
Thanks anyway, Sheriff.
Over here.
What's going on?
Who's doing that shooting? Open up!
Come on in.
- What's going on? Night target practice?
- Oh!
Somebody tries to shoot me in the back,
I defend myself.
You defend yourself almost too well, mister.
They're both dead as doornails.
They came in the window.
It wasn't to wish me pleasant dreams.
OK, OK, self-defence, I guess.
But in this town we don't like violence.
I'm asking you to get out of town as quickly as possible.
Good morning, Bill.
How many glasses have you got?
- A couple.
- Can we dirty them?
I want to have a little talk with you.
What brings you all the way out here?
What's on your mind?
This.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That my memory is pretty good.
I've thought all night about whether what I'm about to do is the right thing.
But I've known you for too many years to keep quiet.
Where'd you find them?
On a dead man's feet.
Who?
Last night, two men were killed.
Those were on one of them.
- Who killed them?
- A stranger.
A certain Ryan. He went west.
All right, stand up. Don't turn around.
Keep your hand away from your gun.
If you're gonna follow somebody, do a better job of it.
This world is full of nervous characters.
They shoot you in the back first and then introduce themselves.
Tell me what you're after.
15 years, there's been no new track.
Only a spur.
Then you come along and there's three spurs.
If you know the story, then you can figure out what I'm looking for.
We've both got an account to settle with the same people.
- Only I want to take first crack at them.
- We can go on together.
No, son, you got too much hate in you.
That's gonna get you in trouble.
Hate's hate. There's no two ways.
Somebody once wrote that revenge is a dish that has to be eaten cold.
Hot as you are, you're liable to end up with indigestion.
No, I'm going on alone.
- You better shoot me.
- Do I have to?
If you don't, I'm gonna end up on your heels again.
Yeah, I suppose so.
Important thing is to get there first.
That's why I'm gonna leave your horse at Red Rock, ten miles from here.
An advantage you're gonna have to give me. Good luck, son.
You might need that.
Whiskey and water.
Where do I find Cavanaugh?
Another drink?
I'm looking for Burt Cavanaugh.
Look, friend...
...I'm selling whiskey.
Thanks for the information.
Hold it. What do you want up here?
Ryan.
Well, this certainly is a surprise.
Was it a good surprise or a bad surprise?
Why? Did you think
I wasn't happy to see you?
How much did you give those two to get rid of me?
I don't understand.
It doesn't make much difference. Whatever you paid, it was a bad investment.
I should kill you.
Or maybe I have learned something after all these years.
As an example, even a rat like you can be worth more alive than dead.
I know it was not a nice trick walking out on you at the trial, but...
No, no, no.
You didn't walk out on me, you sold me.
You turned me in. There's a big difference.
It was a long time ago.
Why don't we drop it?
Here. Here's 100 dollars.
I know it's not much, but business hasn't been good lately.
- 100 dollars?
- Yes.
100 dollars for 15 years in jail?
Maybe I was right in the beginning.
- Maybe a rat like you is better dead.
- All right, don't get excited, Ryan.
- What do you want?
- What?
- 1,000 for every year in jail. Cash.
Where am I going to get my hands on that kind of money?
Oh, you'll find it.
I'm sure you'll find it.
I'm not in a hurry.
Tomorrow morning will be all right.
It warms my heart to see all my old friends doing so well.
You're all pretty well established, aren't you?
I'm gonna visit our friend in Lyndon City.
See what the first citizen has to say for himself.
Till tomorrow. Oh...
Watch out for these things.
Wouldn't want you to get hurt.
Not yet.
- Bad luck at the table, friend?
- Not bad luck, mister.
It was robbery.
They took everything I had.
You look like you need a drink.
You don't understand.
That was just a warning.
They got all my money, but I wanna keep my skin.
Sure you do. Who said anything different?
- I can't go back in there.
- Come on.
No. I don't want to. No, no, no.
I don't wanna get killed.
Listen, they'll kill me. Do you hear?
Two whiskeys.
- How much did you lose?
- 30 dollars.
What are you doing? Are you joking?
Drink.
Thanks.
Well, take the dough. And beat it.
I never leave without finishing my drink.
That should take care of it.
Stranger, I'm putting you under arrest, charged with attempted homicide.
Means you can be put in prison for ten years.
- When can we try this man, Judge?
- Tomorrow.
Take him to jail.
I'm sorry it turned out this way.
Hold it!
If I'm worth anything as a witness,
I'd say this is a case of self-defence.
More than anything I've seen in my life.
Based on the personality of the witness, the charge is withdrawn. Cards.
You were lucky. Get out of here now.
I want to talk with our friend here.
Young man, you're a faster draw than all those stupid idiots.
If you're looking for a job, I may be able to help. Come up to my office.
Hands behind your head, son.
Now let that hammer down. Slow.
At ease.
You still got a lot to learn, son.
This time you got something to learn, too.
Oh?
What?
Cavanaugh's paying me 500 dollars to kill you.
- Another bad investment.
- You think so?
- Maybe I didn't take him seriously.
- If you didn't, you'd have been right.
But tell me, why does he want you killed?
And who is Cavanaugh?
You ask too many questions.
I can pay for the information with his 500.
He's worth more than that to me. 15,000.
So I suggest you keep your distance.
'Cause if you don't,
I might get mad.
That's a warning.
I'll find out who he is.
And if he's who I think he is...
...get ready to get mad.
Hey! Hey, wait a second.
Wait. I wanna thank you. Yes, sir.
I ain't worth much and it's been a real spell since anybody's done anything for me.
But if you asked me to walk on fire,
I'd just started walking.
I might ask you a lot less.
Like what you know about Burt Cavanaugh.
- How long's he lived here?
- When I got here, he was already boss.
But if you want to know more about him,
I know the right man.
Get a good, strong bottle of rum,
'cause the more this man drinks, the more he talks.
All the sheep are gone, and the pastor lies sleeping alone.
The bottle. The bottle!
Better drunk than dead. Here's to you.
Bottoms up.
Now tell me about Burt Cavanaugh.
That's my drunken wife. Shh!
If there's any alcohol a mile away, she smells it.
The bottle. Where's the bottle?
- There isn't any bottle.
- Where is the bottle?
I know you've got some.
- There it is.
- But it isn't ours. It's his.
My good man, forgive the impression you're getting of us. It's just that she's my wife.
She's a bit... The poor woman's a drunk.
Uh... Before you finish that off, tell me about Cavanaugh.
Cavanaugh. I'll tell you.
He's a scorpion, he's a snake, a beast!
All right, let me tell it.
When I arrived here, the church was in good order.
I was an upright preacher then.
- But what about him?
- What about who?
- Cavanaugh.
- Oh, Cavanaugh.
All he had was a pistol and a pack of cards.
You know, now he's called... Four Aces.
- Full house. Queens.
- Not enough. Full house, aces.
Poor man. The ladies love you but not Lady Luck.
- Give me another chance.
- What security have you got?
You know I've lost it all.
You've taken everything.
My farm, my cattle, everything.
You know that.
Then get out of here. You're using space.
Only 500 dollars.
Just give me a chance, that's all I ask.
Just 500 dollars.
- Who wants to come in the game?
- I do.
My employees don't play.
Deal the cards.
How many?
I stand.
I'm happy to take your 500.
Four aces.
Me, too. Four aces.
Look, young man,
I'm afraid I don't feel like joking.
Neither do I.
Remember, Cavanaugh,
15 years ago at the Mesita ranch?
You and your friends killed everybody.
But you forgot one thing:
To kill me.
Give him a gun.
Get up!
Piano player, hit three notes.
Two lessons, my son.
First, watch behind you.
Second, count your shots.
Four bullets for one man, that's a waste.
I'll go and drive away his horse.
Hey!
Damn.
Hey!
- Are you in charge here?
- Yes, sir. What is it?
- What time's the train for Lyndon City?
- It left 15 minutes ago.
- What time's the next one?
- The day after tomorrow.
Keep calm.
Your pal left your horse with me.
- He took the train, huh?
- Sure. But that's not all.
He said a pal of his would be coming along.
He said I should give you the horse and a kiss. The horse is there.
Now, where do you want that kiss?
No, thanks. I'll settle for the horse.
I am proud indeed to be here today, and I consider it a great honour to introduce to you our leading banker, Mr Walcott.
There is more.
Senator Carlyle has kindly agreed to have the Atchison-Santa Fe line pass through our growing little town!
Which augurs a fine, prosperous, up-and-coming future...
While I'd be delighted to continue to address you,
I must go because duty calls me.
Hooray for Senator Carlyle!
Hooray for Lyndon City!
One is here and the other will be here very soon.
That's the one who killed Cavanaugh.
Go and get Pedro and Paco and the others.
Just say that I decided the party is for nine. Hello.
Nothing else. The boys'll get it.
Walcott, a stranger's asking for you.
Show him in, then.
Easy, friend.
You're all alike.
Years go by and you all do the same things.
Gun in the drawer, knife in the back. Lies.
You were afraid that I wouldn't receive you?
Quite the contrary.
I expected you to receive me too well.
So I figured it's safer to come in from behind.
Walcott, that stranger's gone.
I'm already here, friend.
So you can go on out.
Close the door behind you.
This is a private talk.
The door!
Well... looks like we've become important.
And rich.
You've changed your old clothes, haven't you?
But you still haven't been able to change your face.
You still got the meanest-looking face
I ever did see.
- Now listen, Ryan...
- Shut up.
And I can tell you where I've been all these years, because of you.
I've seen some mean faces. Plenty of them.
Things aren't the same as they used to be.
Because I can pay now.
Just sit down. We'll talk about it.
There isn't that much talking to do.
Just five words.
Fifteen thousand plus fifteen thousand.
15,000 bucks doubled?
A lot of money, Ryan.
It's a pretty high figure.
But not for 15 years in jail.
And you'll have to pay Cavanaugh's share.
He was killed right under my nose and
I didn't get a chance to collect the money.
I'll give you an advance now.
How about... 10,000 bucks?
All right.
The rest tomorrow.
Now it's my turn.
All right?
Hold it.
Don't kill him yet.
He's useful to us for the time being.
We could finish you off now.
But that would be too simple.
Let me tell you this, boys.
Ryan was sent to us by heaven.
Good old Ryan is going to be helpful to us like in the good old days.
Wait.
I've been working at this for years, building their confidence in me, the citizens as well as the governor of this state.
But the most important thing is I have in my bank more than a million dollars now.
The funds the state deposited with me in view of our future public works.
What do you think?
Should I build their stupid old public works with this mountain of dollars?
They don't think I should.
I guess I'll have to go along with their idea.
Whoa.
You make sure you don't lose him.
- Mr Walcott.
- Yes. Good evening, Frank.
- Some extra work?
- Open that door while I close this one.
- Who's there?
- Me. Mr Walcott.
Good evening, Mr Walcott.
- My God, look at that.
- A million dollars.
You're from Baker?
Tell Baker that I told him all that I know already.
Tell him I want to live in peace, understand?
There is no use to go on tormenting me!
I know nothing at all about that case of coins.
Now that gold has disappeared, but if he'd listened... we could have avoided this altogether.
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.
They couldn't uncover any more.
I can't tell Baker what happened to the money.
Go back and tell him that.
Word's around you had a visitor... and Baker knows it.
Name of Jackson.
Well...
Jackson was here... or Baker's got it all wrong.
He's not wrong.
Maybe Baker would like to know just what you and Jackson had to say... about the cash box.
That's not what I'm being paid for.
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.
Why do you think Jackson may be assuming another name?
I would have found him already.
When I start off to find somebody,
I find him.
That's why they pay me.
What is Baker paying you?
That your family?
Yes.
Nice family.
What does he pay you for murdering me?
Five hundred dollars... to get the name.
The name.
Carson. Bill Carson.
That's what he calls himself now.
That's a lot of money... 1,000.
A thousand dollars?
And some in gold. That's a tidy sum.
But when I'm paid,
I always see the job through.
It's you.
Any information?
Too much.
He said quite a bit that should interest you... and one or two things that interested me.
Such as?
The name Jackson's hiding under is Bill Carson.
That's your bit.
Keep talking.
He also mentioned something about a certain cash box... which just happened to disappear.
- That's my bit.
- Anything else?
Not enough for you, eh?
Well, you don't have to worry.
He won't say anything to anybody again.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Perfect.
Here you are.
Here. This is for you.
You did a good job for me.
Worth $500.
Yeah. I almost forgot.
He gave me a thousand.
I think his idea was that I kill you.
But you know the pity is, when I'm paid,
I always follow my job through.
- You know that.
- No! Angel Eyes...
No. No pistol, amigo.
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.
You know you've got a face beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?
Yeah.
But you don't look like the one who'll collect it.
A couple steps back.
Thank you.
How much are you worth now?
How much?
Two thousand dollars.
- That's right... $2,000.
- Yeah.
You'll pay for this!
I hope you end up in a graveyard... with the cholera and the rabies and the plague!
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!
Put me down!
I hope your mother ends up in a two-dollar whorehouse! Cut me loose!
You can still save yourself.
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.
Let me go!
I think I feel sick.
The blood is bursting through my...
I'm dry, Blondie.
Water.
You swine! You son of a bitch!
Let me go!
You're brave with a man who's tied up! Come back!
Come back and fight! You bastard.
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.
Cut it out! Cut it out!
I'm an honest farmer!
I'm innocent of any...
So, you're an honest farmer.
You recognize this man?
- Me?
- Yeah, it's you.
Me? Who says so? You can't even read.
Yeah, roll it up. Roll it up.
I'll give you a good idea where you can put it.
To hell with all you sheriffs and deputies and all who gave birth to you.
Hey, everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!
Judas! You sold my hide!
But you won't enjoy any of that money... not a penny.
If there's justice in the world, every penny will go to the undertakers.
You know who you are?
You want to know whose son you are?
You don't, I do. Everybody does.
You're the son of a thousand fathers, all bastards like you.
And your mother... Your mother!
She's... You bastard!
Your mother... it's better not to talk of her!
I never hurt anybody!

Proceed.
Five for you. One, two... three, four, five for me.
Five for you... and five for me.
Know how much you're worth now?
- No. How much?
There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend... those with a rope around their neck, and the people who have the job of cutting.
Listen, the neck at the end of the rope is mine.
I run the risks... so the next time, I want more than half.
You may run the risks, my friend, but I do the cutting.
If we cut down my percentage...
Cigar?
It's liable to interfere with my aim.
But if you miss, you had better miss very well.
Whoever double-crosses me and leaves me alive... he understands nothing about Tuco.
Nothing.

- What'd you find out, Shorty?
- If you ask me, it seems like a book... an armed unit escorting a cash box of gold coins meets a Yankee ambush... and only three of them are saved:
Stevens, Baker and Jackson.
The thing that wasn't saved, though, was the coins.
But then the army decides, of course... it ought to hold a hearing, and Jackson's acquitted.
- He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.
- I know his name.
But you don't know just who you're looking for, and I do.
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.
Where is Carson?
All I know is Carson reenlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.
He lives with a girl called Maria who'll tell you.
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.
- Where's she?
- Now, what's the name of that town?
Someplace fairly near.
Santa Ana.
Adios, half-soldier.
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey!

"The condemned hired himself out as a guide to a wagon train.

People with ropes around their necks don't always hang.
What do you mean?
"The condemned is also guilty..."
Even a filthy beggar like that has got a protecting angel.
- "...as a Mexican general."
- A golden-haired angel watches over him.
"For all these crimes the accused has made...
"a full, spontaneous confession.
"Therefore, we condemn him to be hung by the neck until dead."
May the Lord have mercy on his soul. Proceed.
Let's get the hell out of here!
What are you trying to say... anybody can miss a shot?
Nobody misses when I'm at the end of the rope.
You've never had a rope around your neck. I'll tell you something.
When that rope starts to pull tight, you can feel the devil bite your ass.
Yeah, you're right. It's getting tougher.
The way I figure, there's not too much future with a sawed-off runt like you.
What do you mean?
'Cause I don't think you'll ever be worth more than $3,000.
What do you mean?
I mean, our partnership is untied.
Oh, no. Not you. You remain tied.
I'll keep the money, and you can have the rope.
You filthy, double-crossing bastard!
- Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...
- The way back to town is only 70 miles.
You know, if you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.
You filthy bastard! Come here!
Come here! Cut this rope off!
Get off that horse, you filthy coward!
If I ever catch you, Blondie,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!
I'll scalp you! I'll skin you alive!
I'll hang you up by your thumbs!
You pig! You vulture!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
Such ingratitude, after all the times
I've saved your life.
Where are you going? Wait a minute.
This is only a trick.
You wouldn't leave me here.
Come back! Wait! Blondie!
Listen, Blondie...
I believe madam is home.
Sweet dreams, and many thanks from the Seventh Cavalry!
You filthy rats!
Maria.
Honey? Is that you, Bill?
Who are you? What do you want with me?
Go on talking about Bill Carson.
I don't know him.
You were calling to him in the dark.
Where is he?
What are you going to do to him?
I'll ask the questions.
Where is he?
Where is he? Where?
That's enough!
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago... and went away with his unit... they all left.
Which company? Where'd they go?
Third Cavalry, General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.
That's all I know, I swear!
But, but...
I'm very sorry, but the store's closing.
- Revolvers.
- Yeah, revolvers.
Revolvers.
Well, here's where I keep the best ones.
Here. Remington, Colt... a Roat, Smith-Wesson...
Colt... Navy...
Joslyn... another Remington.
- And this one is...
- That's enough.
Cartridges.
You want to try the pistol?
Just step out back.
Let's go.
Move. Move.
Cartridge.
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.
No.
Fifty dollars.
How much?
A hundred dollars.
Two hundred dollars.
It's all I've got.
Here.
Come here.
This morning I heard the whole thing.
They say that Colonel Canby's closing in with his Northerners... and no later than tomorrow that they'll be in the city.
That's why these Southerners are getting out.
You see, as soon as these cowards hear a Blue Shirt's around, they run.
- These Rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.
They'll soon be finished.
We get rid of these bastards, then we begin making money on those Yankees.
They carry gold, not paper dollars, and they're going to beat the South.
Look. See that one with the white beard sitting in the wagon?
General Sibley. He looks dead.
He's finally getting out of our hair.
Hurray for Dixie!
Where's the owner of that horse?
- Please, sir, a bad heart condition...
- Where?
The war has frightened me already.
I'm looking for the owner of that horse.
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig. Where is he now?
You leave him be.
He doesn't know who rides every horse.
You stay quiet, old hen.
Upstairs. Upstairs in room four, señor.
Hear that?
You rotten criminals. How dare you?
Your spurs.
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend... those that come in by the door... and those that come in by the window.
Take off that pistol belt.
It's empty.
Mine isn't.
Even when Judas hanged himself, there was a storm too.
That could be cannon fire.
Cannon fire or storm, it's all the same to you.
You ever see this before, my friend?
Throw it over the roof beam.
That's it.
Now get on that.
That's right.
Now make sure the rope is tight.
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.
Now put the rope around your neck.
That's very good.
It's too big for your neck, huh?
We fix that right away.
I have another system... a little different than yours.
I don't shoot the rope.
I shoot the legs off the stool.
Welcome, my friend.
If you're looking for a summer vacation spot, you've found it.
Our hotel is luxurious and filled with conveniences.
And the attractions don't stop there.
International cuisine, healthful and nutritious food.
Corn cobs, Dixie-style.
Our government has spared no expense.
As you can see, we are treated very well.
Have you ever heard of anyone by the name of Bill Carson?
And you? Have you ever heard of someone named Canby? No?
Well, you see, he's a Yankee colonel who decided to tear us to pieces.
The only thing we care about is saving our own hides.
And you ask me if I know someone.
I just don't know what you drifters could be thinking.
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the Third.
If he's with the Third, they've already left.
For Glorieta.
Canby's front line is right on their heels.
Those poor young devils.
And the desert lies ahead of them. I really doubt that any of them are still alive.
And what if they were still alive?
Worse.
Well, then, you must not have heard anything about Batterville.
It's one of those Yankee prison camps you'd better hope you never end up in.
Keep it. It's yours.

Sorry, Shorty.
Move. Come on, let's go.
I don't know. As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.
Burns, huh? They say people with fair skin can't take too much.
Like that, you won't have to carry so much.
Where we going?
Where? Where I'm going, amigo.
Over that way.
Another hundred miles of beautiful, sunbaked sand.
Even the armies are afraid to march through there.
Sibley's men are retreating up there.
Canby's men are coming here.
But no one will set foot in this hell... except you and me.
One hundred miles... that's a nice walk.
What was it you told me the last time?
"If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it."
And if you won't manage it, you'll die, only slowly... very slowly, old friend.
After you, please. Start walking.
Taking a rest?
Come on, Blondie.
We don't have very far to go.
Only 70 miles.
Only eight and a half hours more before sunset.
That's not too bad.
Come on.
Okay, let's eat.
That is, I'll eat.
Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.
You want some water?
Drink. Drink.
Come on. Come on.
Well, Blondie. So long.
And so, Blondie... it's good-bye.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, boy.
Easy, easy.
Easy, easy. Attaboy. That's nice.
Water. Water.
200,000 in gold.
It's yours. Just get me water.
What's that you say?
Who the hell are you?
Carson.
My name is Bill Carson now. It's Carson.
Surprise attack.
All dead. My name is Jackson, not Carson.
Carson, yeah, yeah.
Glad to meet you, Carson.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
What did you say about the dollars?
200,000... all mine.
Was the Third Cavalry's.
Baker has nothing.
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.
Where? Where, here?
Here? Talk!
- Huh?
- In the cemetery.
- Which cemetery?
- The one... on Sad Hill.
There's a grave by...
Which grave?
Have a name? Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk.
There's no number. There's a name.
- Huh?
- It's written...
Yes?
Water!
You talk first, huh?
I'll give you water later.
Sad Hill Cemetery. Okay.
In the grave. Okay.
But it must have a name or a number on it, huh?
There must be a thousand, five thousand!
Don't die, huh?
Don't die. I'll get you water.
Stay there. Don't move. I'll get you water.
Don't die until later, you son of a...
Get away from there!
- He's dead.
- Yeah.
I'll kill you.
If you do that, you'll always be poor... just like the greasy rat that you are.
If I were you, I'd keep me alive.
What did he tell you, huh?
- A name.
- Huh?
- A name on a grave.
- What name?
Blondie, don't die.
Blondie, don't die. I'm your friend.
Please don't die. Please!
I'm your friend. Come on.
I'll help you. I'll help you.
Don't move. I'll be right back.
Here's the water. Don't die like that pig.
Hey, Blondie, here's water. Water, Blondie.
Don't drink, don't drink.
Is no good for you.
Feel better?
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please, don't die.
Hey, open up! Open up! Hurry!
Settle down. Settle down. Who's there?
What do you mean, "Who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?
If I were a Yankee, you wouldn't have time to ask me that.
Come on.
Sergeant, listen to this corporal for a moment.
Yes, sir.
Sergeant, I have a gravely wounded man here, if he's not dead already.
- He's still alive?
- Well, he seems to be.
- What happened?
- It was a trap.
- Only the two of us got away.
- Name and traveling papers.
Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
Third Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron, arriving from San Rafael. Is that enough?
Are you reading when this man is dying?
Why, Corporal, we're trying to withdraw and you're looking for an infirmary?
If you want one, you'll have to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.
- Apache Canyon?
- Apache Canyon.
Is a Mission San Antonio around here?
Sure, 18 miles south. Take him there.
The brothers take care of any wounded, no matter what the color of his uniform.
And keep your eyes open, the area is full of Yankees.
Thank you. Goodbye, Sergeant.
Take care.
- I've got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds here.
Let him have yours.
- Where's Pablo Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez.
He's away at the moment.
He should be back any day now.
Well, it doesn't matter. For the moment, we take very good care of my friend.
And may God be praised.
In case you didn't know it,
God is on our side too... because He hates the Yanks, huh, Blondie?
Blondie? Father, is he still breathing?
- Yes, of course.
- You're heavy.
There.
All right, put a fresh bandage on him.
Put him in my cell.
Easy.
- Out, soldier. Out you go. Come on.
- Look out for him, please.
He's like a brother to me.
Hey, Father, I...
Father, did he speak? Did he say anything?
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything, Father?
Oh, no, he hasn't spoken as yet.
But you mustn't worry.
He's both young and strong.
That's what's kept him going until now.
He should regain his strength in a very short time.
Thank you, Father. You don't know how much this boy's life means to me.
Thanks be to Jesus. Thanks to all of you.
Hey, Blondie.
The old father tells me you'll be up and around in a few days.
You're very lucky to have me so close when it happened.
Think if you'd been on your own.
Look, I mean, when... when one is ill... it's good to have somebody close by... friends or relations.
Do you have parents, Blondie? A mother?
Not even a mother.
No one?
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.
We're all alone in the world.
I have you, you have me.
Only for a little while, I mean.
It had to happen now.
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.
We could have all that money in our hands.
I must tell you the truth.
In my place, you would do the same thing.
It's all over for you now.
There's nothing anyone can do anymore.
God help me. It's my fault.
Mine, mine, mine.
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.
If I knew that my last hour had come,
I swear... in my place... in your place,
I would do the same thing.
I would tell about the gold. Yes, I would.
I'd tell the name on the grave.
After all, what good is the money to you if you're dead?
I know the name of the cemetery, but you know how many graves are there?
Please, Blondie.
Please, have a little, huh? Here. Coffee.
Please, tell me the name... on the grave.
If I get my hands on the $200,000...
I'll always honor your memory.
I swear, I'll always honor your memory.
Come closer.
Tell me.
Why, you dirty...
I'll sleep better... knowing my good friend is by my side... to protect me.
"Tuco, water." Here's water.
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water.
All right, you dirty skunk, get your ass off the bed.
Come on, the party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.
From the way the wounded are pouring into this place, we better leave... before we get caught up in the war.
- Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
- Yeah.
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.
- Where, this way?
- Yes.
Don't you recognize me?
It's me, Tuco. Let me embrace you.
I don't know the right thing.
I was just passing by here,
I said to myself...
"I wonder if my brother remembers his brother."
Did I do wrong?
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.
You have seen me, Tuco.
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.
Oh, my uniform!
It's a long story.
But let's talk about you.
It's more important. You look very well.
A bit thin, perhaps, but... you were always thin, eh, Pablito?
What about our parents?
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.
Nine years?
So it's nine years. Nine years!
Our mother has been dead a long time now.
Our father died only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.
He asked for you to be there, but there was only me.
And you?
Outside of evil, what else have you managed to do?
It seems to me you once had a wife someplace.
Not one. Lots of them.
One here, one there, wherever I found them.
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
What good would that be?
Just keep on the way you're going.
Go away.
- And the Lord have mercy on your soul.
- Sure, I'll go, I'll go.
While I'm waiting for the Lord to remember me...
I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother Ramirez... will tell you something.
You think you're better than I am.
Where we came from, if one didn't want to die of poverty... one became a priest or a bandit.
You chose your way, I chose mine.
Mine was harder!
You talk about Mother and Father.
You remember, when you left to become a priest, I stayed behind.
I must have been ten, twelve.
I don't remember which, but I stayed.
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I will tell you something.
You became a priest because you were too much of a coward to do what I do.
Tuco.
Please forgive me, brother.
Ah, my belly's full.
Nice guy, my brother.
I didn't tell you my brother was in charge here?
Everything. Like the pope almost.
He's in charge in Rome.
Yeah, yeah, my brother, he say to me...
"Stay, brother. Don't go home.
We never see each other.
"Here there's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too."
Whenever we see each other, he never lets me go. It's always the same story.
My brother... he is crazy about me.
That's so. Even a tramp like me, no matter what happens...
I know there's a brother somewhere who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.
Sure.
Well, after a meal, there's nothing like a good cigar.
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.
Going this way, we cross the Rio Grande.
That sure is a long way.
Here to the northwest, through all of Texas...
- After that...
- Then what?
When we get there, I'll tell you.
You're not worried, are you?
Those men aren't worried about anything anymore, are they?
But since I'm alive and I've noticed we'll be crossing Yankee and
Confederate lines a few times.
I thought you might tell me where we're going.
Towards $200,000.
Is that good enough for you?
Whoa.
Hey, wake up, you.
- The troops are coming. Come on.
- Blue or gray?
They're gray like us. Let's say
"hello" to them and then get going.
Hoorah! Hoorah for the Confederacy!
Hoorah! Down with General Grant!
- Hoorah for General... what's his name?
- Lee.
Lee!
God is with us because He hates the Yanks too!
God's not on our side
'cause He hates idiots also.
Hut, two, three, four.
Prisoners of war, forward!
March!
Halt!
Left face!
Form a single file. Move!
- Jonathan Frost!
- Present!
- Richard McGilley!
- Present!
- Nathaniel Sullivan!
- Present.
- Robert Clark!
- Present.
- Sam Richmond!
- Present.
Bill Carson.
I said Bill Carson!
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?
All right, what's he doing, sleeping?
Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.
Bill Carson!
Yeah, that's me.
Please, Carson... answer "present."
What are you, deaf?
Now suppose you say "present," Carson.
I like big fat men like you.
When they fall, they make more noise... and sometimes they never get up.
Wallace... that's enough.
Sergeant!
The captain wants to see you right away.
Be sure these two get good treatment.
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.
Yeah.
For the last time, Sergeant...
I'm telling you, I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.
No more brutality.
There's hundreds of prisoners out there and only a few men to guard them.
Now what am I supposed to do?
I have to have respect.
I think that you'll manage to gain their respect by treating them better.
Are our men treated that well in Andersonville camp?
I don't give a goddamn what they do in Andersonville.
While I'm in charge here, the prisoners are not to be tortured... or cheated or murdered.
That an accusation?
Sergeant, gangrene is eating my leg away, not my eyes.
I know the prisoners here are being robbed systematically.
I know there's scum around who are bivouacked near the camp... waiting for someone to deliver this loot.
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't permit any such trickery. Am I clear?
Yes, sir... just as long as you're the commandant.
Yes, Sergeant.
I know this leg means
I won't last very long... but I pray I can manage to have enough time to amass evidence... and bring to a court-martial... all those who discredit and dishonor... the uniform of the Union.
I wish you luck.
You and the others better lay low for a few days.
No, I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.
- Bring me Carson.
- Right.
Listen, Angel Eyes said for us to lay low for a few days... but we'll keep close enough to keep an eye on things.
Come on, saddle your horses.
Get in.
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.
There's no formalities here.
It's been a long time.
You're hungry. Sit down, eat.
I knew it, I knew it.
The minute I saw you, I said to myself...
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes.
"I'll bet he got himself an easy job...
"and he never forgets a friend."
I never forget old friends, Tuco.
- Right.
- It's good to see old friends again.
Good.
Especially when they've come from so far away... and have so much to talk about.
And you do have a lot to talk about, haven't you?
You were captured near Fort Craig.
Well, if you were with Sibley, that means then that you... were coming from Santa Fe.
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Very hard.
Especially if you don't have anything to drink.
Why are you going under the name of Bill Carson now?
One name is as good as another.
Not wise to use your own name.
Like you. I'll bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.
Sergeant Angel Eyes.
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?
Music? Yes, it's very good... very good for the digestion.
So...
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
That fake too?
Bill Carson's name's written in it.
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.
More feeling.
Was Carson dead or alive when you found him?
What'd he tell you about the money?
I don't...
I don't know what you're talking about.
How's your digestion now?
You'd better talk.
I have nothing to tell you.
Play that fiddle, you!
You can sure consider yourself much luckier than your pal.
Wallace will punch your friend as long as the song goes.
So many of us have had a session in there.
Enough. Enough. I talk. I talk.
What did he say about the money?
It's buried in a grave.
- Where?
- Sad Hill...
Sad Hill Cemetery.
Which grave?
I don't know. I don't know, I tell you.
Ask Blondie.
He knows the name on the grave.
Put those clothes on.
- Why?
- We're going for a ride.
- Where?
- To find $200,000.
I know the name of the cemetery now... and you know the name of the grave.
You're not gonna give me the same treatment?
Would you talk?
No, probably not.
That's what I thought.
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco... but you're smart enough to know that talking won't save you.
And Tuco... is he...
Not yet.
But he's in very good hands.
You've changed partners, but you still got the same deal.
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.
There's two of us. it should make it easier than just one.
Yeah.
Hold it. That's it, don't move.
Now don't breathe. Still. That's it.
Got it. Thank you.
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?
To hell, with a rope around his neck and a price on his head.
$3,000, friend.
That's a lot of money for a head.
I'll bet they didn't even pay you a penny for your arm.
I told you once, friend, if I ever get you down... you're gonna need a lot of help to get up again.
You're a lot luckier than that one.
Grub, a rope, and you're all finished.
And there isn't any partner this time to shoot you down.
If your friends stay out in the damp, they're liable to catch a cold, aren't they?
Or a bullet.
Hear that, boys? Come on out here.
Since we're all going in the same direction, might as well go together.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Six... Perfect number.
Isn't three the perfect number?
Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.
Sure would like to put your paw on it, huh?
I would like to piss. It's rough.
I've been shaken up on this train nearly ten hours now.
You smell like a pig already... but let's not try to make things any worse.
Get going.
I can't while you're watching me.
You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?
You don't want to break our friendship, huh? Well, I'll break it.
Halt.
Take your places.
Ready!
Aim! Fire!
Slim, take care of the horses.
I've been looking for you for eight months.
Whenever I should've had a gun in my right hand, I thought of you.
Now I find you in exactly the position that suits me.
I had lots of time to learn how to shoot with my left.
When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.
Every gun makes its own tune.
It's perfect timing, Large One.
Clem, follow him.
Just a minute. I'll be right there.
Just give me a little time to get dressed, and I'll open up.
Put your drawers on and take your gun off.
How the hell did you get out of that pigsty?
My own way. I'm here with your old friend, Angel Eyes.
You talked, you traitor. You talked.
No, I didn't talk.
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.
You, me...
So only you know your half of the secret?
I'm very happy you're working with me... and we're together again.
I get dressed,
I kill him and be right back.
Oh, listen...
I forgot to mention...
He's not alone. There's five of them.
- Five?
- Yeah, five of them.
So that's why you came to Tuco?
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.
They shot him at close range.
Well, look who's here.
The other one will be along.
They'll come looking for us.
Watch out.
There's two of them.
I want that blond alive.
You, back there. Come on, let's go.
Were you gonna die alone?
Halt!
- Angel Eyes is mine, huh?
- All right.
"See you soon..."
"Idiots."
It's for you.
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
Like a cemetery, for instance?
There should be a bridge across that river.
- We'd better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me, Blondie.
I got a good sense of where I'm going.
Tuco has taken you this far.
I will take you all the way...
Gentlemen.
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.
Come along now. Follow me.
We found them near the perimeter, sir.
- Where do you hail from?
- Illinois.
- And you?
- I'm with him.
Any reason for being around here?
We want to enlist, General.
You better learn to distinguish rank.
I'm a captain.
Get the hell out.
It sure as hell might be you today, so go write your will.
Yes, sir.
So you want to enlist?
You gotta take a test to prove it.
Well, show me.
You've got a career. At the least,
I'd say you'll make colonel.
- Really?
- Sure.
Like it says in the manual...
"You've got every qualification...
"to become an expert in the use of weapons."
For this, sir, is the most potent weapon in war.
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.
Volunteers.
You want to enlist, hmm?
Let's go.
Come on, gentlemen. Come on.
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're still in time.
Whoever has the most liquor to get the soldiers drunk and send them to be slaughtered... is the winner.
We and the ones over on the other side of the river only have one thing in common.
All of us reek of alcohol.
What did you say your name was?
And you?
No.
Names don't matter.
Yes, because soon you can join the gallant heroes of Branson Bridge.
- We have two attacks a day.
- Two attacks a day?
Sure, the Rebs have decided that damn bridge... is the key to this whole area.
Stupid, useless bridge.
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.
And headquarters has declared we must take that ridiculous flyspeck... even if all of us are killed.
Otherwise, the key will get rusty... and just be a spot on the wall.
And that's not all.
Both sides want the bridge intact.
Intact is how the South wants it... and we want it intact too.
You'll all turn to dust... but one thing is sure, boys:
Branson Bridge will stand unbroken.
Is it bad to speak the way I do to volunteers?
I've done a lot worse.
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!
In here, I've destroyed it all.
It's a court-martial offense to imagine... to dream of blowing it up... a serious crime.
Even to think of destroying that bridge is just...
Why not really blow it up, Captain?
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.
I've been dreaming about it.
I've even worked out a plan.
I sure have.
The best time is after the attack... when there's a truce to get the wounded.
If I could do it...
I could save many thousands of men.
But what I lack is the guts.
They're beginning their daily slaughter right on time.
Captain, all companies are awaiting your orders.
Be right there.
Let's go.
All right, friends... come along and enjoy the spectacle.
Companies, report!
Company B ready!
Company E ready!
Company D ready!
Companies, forward!
It looks like the captain is really asking for a bullet in his guts.
Yeah.
I've never seen so many men wasted so badly.
I have a feeling it's really gonna be a good long battle.
- Blondie?
- Huh?
The money's on the other side of the river.
Where?
Amigo, I said the other side, and that's enough.
But while the Confederates are there, we can't get across.
What would happen if somebody were to blow up that bridge?
Yeah.
Then these idiots would go somewhere else to fight.
Maybe.
Doctor, quick, the captain's wounded.
Hurry, a stretcher.
Easy. Easy now.
Get things ready.
A little of this will help.
Take a slug of this, Captain.
Keep your ears open.
What are you doing? No, leave me alone.
You realize we might be risking our lives.
Yeah, and if I get killed... you'll never get your hands on all that beautiful money.
Yeah, Tuco... it sure would be a pity.
Doc.
Doctor... could you help me live a little more?
I expect good news.
Why don't we tell each other our half of the secret?
- Why don't we?
- Huh? You go first.
No, I think it's better that... you start.
All right.
The name of the cemetery is...
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.
The name on the grave is...
Arch Stanton.
Arch Stanton? Are you sure?
Yeah, sure, I'm sure.
It'll be a lot easier with that.
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.
Dig.
You're not digging.
If you shoot me, you won't see a cent of that money.
Why?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause there's nothing in there.
Why, you son of a...
You thought I'd trust you?
$200,000 is a lot of money.
We're gonna have to earn it.
How?
I'll write the name on the bottom of this stone.
The gun.
You pig. You want to get me killed?
When'd you unload it?
Last night.
You see, in this world, there's two kinds of people, my friend... those with loaded guns... and those who dig.
- You dig.
- Where?
Here.
There's no name on it!
There's no name here either.
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.
It was the grave marked "Unknown"... right beside Arch Stanton.
Go ahead.
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't play a joke on me like that.
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.
Now I want you to stand up there and put your head in that noose.
Well, now, seems just like old times.
Four for you... and four... four for me.
Blondie!
Hey, Blondie!
You know what you are?
Just a dirty son of a bitch!
They're leaving town.
Wyatt.
Ike Clanton,
Andy Warshaw, Latigo...
Curly Bill Brocius.
Who's in the corral, Virg?
Billy Clanton.
And the McLowerys.
We've come to disarm you.
Raise your hands over your heads!
Virgil?
Can't walk.
Morg?
It's the shoulder.
- Doc?
- Yeah?
Did Virg deputize you?
I swore to something he was muttering about.
Then wear the badge.
Virg, let me help you.
Here... here.
I'm all right, doc.
See to Virg.
- Doc, he's hit.
- It's just my leg.
Just stay still, Virg.
Well, arrest 'em.
I don't know if a county sheriff can arrest a city marshal without a warrant.
We can take him if you can't.
We got enough guns to settle the whole thing right here.
You're under arrest.
For what?
Murder.
Not today, tomorrow, or ever.
You don't have jurisdiction in the city of Tombstone.
If you did, you couldn't make it stick.
We got enough men behind us to make it stick.
Stillwell, if you so much as turn your head toward those men, you'll be laying in the horse manure with your friends.
Wyatt, give me a hand here.
I'll get a warrant.
I'm serving you, Wyatt!
Your badge won't help you this time.
Please accept my condolences,
Mr. Clanton.
We'll be ready in a moment.
You got the warrants now?
Ready for the judge's signature.
If you'd had the law in your hands,
Wyatt would've let you lock them up out at the corral. I know him.
It was a stupid play to try without it.
I didn't have the warrants because I didn't think the Earps would be alive to be served.
At least, that's what you told me.
Yeah, they're alive now.
But their hands are dirty.
And you all got to understand that.
That's what's going to get you elected city marshal.
That is if the county doesn't let the Earps slip through our fingers at the trial.
- You don't have to worry about it.
- I don't intend to.
Get this through your heads.
If this were back east,
I could make law the way they do.
But the best thing
I can do out here is buy it.
You get good value, don't you?
It's been working.
It works until the east gets here.
But if I'm not big enough to buck them when they start to corner the ranges and the railroads and the stockyards, you boys are going to have to go back to living on what the county pays you.
But meanwhile...
Meanwhile, if we don't wanna get eaten up, we're going to have to grow bigger and faster than nature intended.
Yeah... and hope their brothers don't continue to be so lucky as they were this morning.
They won't.
One way or another.
We are ready now,
Mr. Clanton.
I hope you are satisfied,
Mr. Clanton.
I am.
Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me...
Why did you give up practice in dentistry and take up gambling?
What's the word they use?
Irrelevant?
I'll rule on that, Mr. Holiday.
You answer the question.
Was it because of your illness?
Partially.
Or as your growing reputation as a killer?
No. I found there was more gold in people's pockets than in their mouths.
Does that satisfy you?
Eminently.
What was your reason for volunteering your services as a gunfighter to the Earp family?
I owed Wyatt Earp a favor.
You mean you killed a man you didn't even know as a favor to another?
I killed a lot of men I didn't know between 1861 and 1865.
Nobody said anything about it then.
War, Mr. Holliday.
Well, I never did understand the difference.
How many men have you killed as a civilian?
Oh, I don't know.
Somewhere between 18 and 25.
I presume they were all quarrels over your gentlemanly honor.
No. Over money.
That's my profession.
Are you finished?
No. No, not quite.
Then you admit that you accepted a deputy's badge and used it as a cloak to cover an act of homicide as a favor?
I accepted a deputy's badge to uphold the law against lke Clanton who was threatening it with a gang of gunmen... until he decided to pull out and sacrifice his brother to make the Earps look like baby killers so they'd lose votes.
You're out of order, Mr. Holliday.
Just answer the question.
Did you not, as a fact, accept a deputy's badge and...
- I don't need a badge to kill.
- Only the word of Wyatt Earp!
I'd go to hell and back on the word of Wyatt Earp.
So would half the men in this room.
And you observed these impressions of the gunfight from where, Mr. Clanton?
Fly's Photographic Gallery across from the O.K. Corral.
I see.
With the court's permission.
Is Andrew Warshaw in the court?
Yeah. Right here.
Would you mind standing up, Mr. Warshaw?
Is Andrew Warshaw in your employ?
Yes, he is.
Is this the same Andrew Warshaw who's wanted in Pecos County, Texas on two counts of armed robbery and three of murder?
I wouldn't know that.
In what capacity do you employ
Mr. Warshaw?
Scientific stock breeder.
I see.
Now, Andrew Warshaw has been observed regularly wearing a six-gun and saddle holstering a Winchester carbine.
Are these normally considered the tools of his profession?
Maybe he has to force the stock to breed.
Mr. Holliday... that will be all.
You can sit down now,
Mr. Warshaw.
Would William Brocius please stand up?
Is William Brocius in your employ?
Yes, he is.
Is this the same William Brocius who is wanted variously on eight counts of murder in Kansas City, Missouri,
Abilene, Texas, Gallup, New Mexico between the years 1878 and 1881?
I wouldn't know that, either.
In what capacity do you employ him?
Bookkeeper.
- I beg your pardon?
- Bookkeeper.
I see.
That'll be all, Mr. Brocius.
Now, is it a fact that you're a heavy financial backer of another one of your employees,
Pete Spence, for the Tombstone City Marshal post now held by Virgil Earp?
It is a fact.
That will be all.
When you heard the shooting, why did you not go to the aid of your brother and the McLowerys?
It's been so long since there's been a gunfight in this county,
I could scarcely believe my ears.
When you did ascertain that a gunfight was actually in progress, what did you do?
Nothing. I was unarmed.
I find that my familiarity with weapons is not an asset to me as a businessman.
It has been stated that your employees... the bookkeeper and the cattle breeder... were armed.
Why, Mr. Clanton?
I've been told that there's a plot to assassinate me.
Because of my stand for freedom of the range against the easterners.
In my opinion... such was the purpose of the marshal's attack on the O.K. Corral.
That is all.
Then you did have an animosity toward the Clanton group prior to October 26, 1881?
Everyone in town knows I did.
Oh, Marshal, you walked down to that O.K. Corral with your brothers and Doc Holliday in a state of frustration, with malice in your heart, toward lke Clanton and his group.
I've said that. Repeating the question won't make it any stronger.
That's all.
Just a moment, Your Honor.
I should like to reexamine the defendant.
Wyatt, did malice move you against the Clanton group?
No.
Would you tell the court what did?
The Clanton group was armed and made threats of death and violence against us.
It was our duty as sworn peace officers to disarm and arrest them.
I would disarm and arrest
General Ulysses S. Grant if he appeared on the streets of
Tombstone under those circumstances.
Wyatt, I told you before you went down to the corral that I had met with the Clanton group and they agreed to leave town peaceably.
Bryan, you take bribes. You're a thief, a liar, and a disgrace to your office.
I wouldn't take your word if you swore to it on your mother's grave.
You'll live to regret that.
I want to recall Sheriff Bryan.
Now, Sheriff Bryan... would you mind repeating under oath the statement you just made?
I said I attempted to stop the Earps and Holliday as they marched down the street toward the corral.
How did you go about that?
I told them that none of the men at the corral were looking for trouble.
They had all agreed to leave town immediately.
And what was their reply?
They ignored me.
And what did you do then?
I watched them.
I saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLowery raise their hands above their heads... and Tom McLowery threw back his coat and lapel to show that he was unarmed!
And that's when the Earps and Holliday opened fire!
- You swear this under oath?
- I do!
That they fired on the deceased with their coats open and their hands raised in the air!
That's all, Your Honor.
So we see that the prosecution has introduced a substantial body of evidence pointing to the guilt of the defendants.
And much of this stands unrefuted by the defense.
But in the last analysis, the prosecution's case turns on two points.
Whether in fact the shooting was a crime, and whether there was a motive.
As to the first point, both the coroner's report and the independent medical testimony indicate that William Clanton's wrist was penetrated from the outside and that the bullet lodged in his abdomen.
That is not the wound received by a man with his hands in the air.
Tom McLowery's wounds were not the sort that could be received with his hands on his lapels like that, but rather with his hands around a Winchester carbine which he had recently extracted from his horse's saddle holster.
The testimony of Sheriff Bryan therefore stands refuted.
Therefore, since no crime has been established... or even a motive for one...
I find that the defendants were fully justified in their actions, and that these homicides occurred in the discharge of their official duties.
The case of the prosecution is therefore dismissed.
Court is adjourned.
Everybody rise.
Well, shooting from the front side didn't work.
Next time, he'll try it from the back.
We'll get Clanton at the election.
Thanks, Horace.
See you at the polls.
Good night.
Harry... take this over to Doc before you check out, will ya?
Okay.
- Good night, Marshal.
- Good night, Harry.
Hit me.
How much the baby weigh?
Too much.
Don't distract me.
Hit me again.
- Charley, I don't think that...
- Just give me the card, will ya?
If the population keeps growing and you keep stopping in here every time you deliver a baby, you're gonna go broke.
I can't understand why I never win.
You don't play very well.
Besides that, you never cheat.
Cheat?
Do you?
No, I'm too good.
I don't have to.
Well, if you weren't that good?
I'd cheat.
Well, I'll be damned.
I don't think the correct word is "cheat," Charley.
What is that word? Just how much is a player supposed to lose?
Well, now... the house rules fix the percentage.
The regulars know the odds.
Doc's just trying to keep you from giving us your money.
Checked the horses and the prisoners.
You're on duty.
Don't you think it's time to go home, Charley?
I'll walk along with you.
Nope. I'm gonna stay and do a little rule bending.
Good night.
Harry.
Harry, wake up.
Harry, get out of bed.
I just got into bed.
There's someone breaking in downstairs in the barbershop.
What can they steal in the barbershop?
Harry, do you want me to go downstairs?
Sure. You go. You go.
All right. All right.
- Marshal.
- Get my brother. Get my brother, please.
Morg, check the alley!
It's your brother, Marshal.
- Virgil, you all right?
- Couldn't see.
- Stick with us.
- I don't feel anything.
- Where'd the shots come from?
- Barbershop.
Out of the way, Wyatt.
Hold him up, will ya?
Harry, did you see anything?
No. Nothing. Nothing.
Harry, you're lying.
Who did you see?
It was dark.
Where was it dark, Harry?
Marshal... I got a boy and a wife.
So has Virgil.
I can't.
They'll kill me.
That won't help nothing.
Harry, you've got just as much to fear from me as you have from Clanton.
Now, who was it?
It makes no difference what you do to me.
I can't.
Unless you promise I don't have to say this to anyone but you.
All right, Harry.
You've got my word.
Stilwell.
You said "they."
Brocius.
And Spence.
And Warshaw.
All right, Harry.
Whereas six witnesses for the defense have testified that the accused, Peter Spence,
Andrew Warshaw, and William Brocius were playing poker at the Alhambra Saloon at the time of the assault on Marshal Earp's life, and whereas Sheriff Bryan has sworn that his deputy, Frank Stilwell, was on duty at the county jail...
...and since the city prosecutor has failed to produce any evidence to the contrary or any witnesses to the actual assault or to the number or identity of assailants...
Mr. Fitch?
Therefore, the charges of feloniously assaulting Marshal Virgil Earp brought by the city of Tombstone against these defendants are dismissed.
This court is adjourned.
Everybody rise.
Wyatt, he knew you had a witness.
He gave you every chance...
Let it go, Tom.
I'll be damned if I understand a man whose word to a waiter is more important than his brother.
The law won't work when part of it is ignored because everyone is either bought off or terrified.
Then I'll enforce the part that does work.
Wyatt...
Your brother will be a cripple for life.
Who's gonna take his place on the ballot, Wyatt?
I am.
I don't wanna hear a word from you.
I'm just educating myself.
I've never been on the right side of the law.
I want to see how much good it does you when you are.
Andy Warshaw.
Andrew Warshaw.
Andrew Warshaw.
Anson Safford.
Anson Safford.
Anson Safford.
Nervous?
Fair amount.
Well, it should be over by midnight.
I won, didn't I?
Yes, Morgan.
You did.
Wyatt?
What'd he say?
When we were kids, we used to argue about whether, when you were dying, your whole life flashed in front of you or not.
He said,
"It ain't so, Wyatt."
There's two more bags in the carriage.
What are you gonna do, Wyatt?
I'm taking them to Tucson to meet the transcontinental train to California.
Virgil will bury Morgan out there with my folks.
I don't mean that.
What about here?
What do you want us to do?
Nothing.
I'll take legal action when I get back.
The runner-up takes office in Tombstone.
We had to swear in Spence as City Marshal this morning.
You're not gonna find any legal action that's gonna stick.
We'll see.
We've gotten together $20,000 to post his reward money.
Thank you, Hansen.
All aboard!
Horace.
You'll get a telegram from me by the time you reach Tucson, Wyatt.
What are you doing here?
I'm crazy about trains.
Telegram for you, Mr. Earp.
Thank you.
"I've secured your appointment,
Federal Marshal,
"and authority you form posse.
"Arrest suspects Stilwell,
Spence, Brocius, and Warshaw.
"Warrants in mail.
Sorry, no public funds available.
Horace Solomon."
He doesn't name Clanton.
Not enough evidence to get a warrant against Clanton.
Well, you got the first gun for your posse.
You hear the part about no funds available?
I hear the Chamber of Commerce has put up $20,000 reward money.
For arrest and conviction.
Not dead or alive.
Not your style, Doc.
For that kind of money,
I can be as law-abiding as, uh...
...you are.
- Hi, Sherm.
- Wyatt.
Thanks for meeting us.
I'm very sorry about Morgan.
Yeah. You know Doc Holliday.
Sherman McMasters.
You were the arresting officer when
I shot Long Nose Ernie here in '74.
That's right.
Good to see ya.
Wyatt.
I got a tip, and figured it mightn't wait, so I came out to meet you.
Yeah?
You can talk in front of me.
We just went in business together.
Clanton sent Frank Stilwell and two of his gun hands into Tucson.
I think he means to make a clean sweep of the Earps.
Where do you think it'll come?
There's no telling.
If I were you,
I'd get my family off to California, take this train back to Tombstone.
I wish you'd sign on, Sherm.
I would, Wyatt, but I can't afford it.
You know they only pay
$53 a month in Tucson?
With a family, that keeps me on the edge all the time.
I'll match that out of my own pocket, plus a half... and you get a crack at the $20,000 reward.
You'll take this train back to Tombstone?
Yeah.
I'll get my gear.
Stilwell's had time to get to Tucson.
Take care of your family.
All aboard!
Stilwell... you're under arrest.
Drop the shotgun.
Now the gun belt.
Before you start steaming, lke,
Tucson has issued a homicide warrant for Earp for Stilwell's murder.
We'll serve it in Tombstone.
What happened to the two hands you sent with him?
- Earp nailed the first one.
- And the other?
- He, uh...
- Yes?
He left.
Now...
Bryan.
If I gave you a posse of 25 men... you think you might be able to find Earp and maybe even arrest him?
I can handle it, Mr. Clanton.
Ike...
This is local law against federal law.
It's gotten too big for us.
They'll send troops here if anything happens to Earp.
Sit down, Roy.
Advice like that
I can get cheaper than you come.
Bryan, after you organize your posse,
I want you to put 20 men under Spence as Deputy City Marshals.
Put Latigo in charge.
Latigo?
Solomon, Clum, and the rest of them are bound to organize a vigilante committee.
I want them disarmed and out of the way.
Okay, Mr. Clanton.
Ike? Bryan and Latigo don't have to handle that.
I can take care of it.
It's my job.
You won't even be here.
You're going to disappear.
How do you mean disappear?
I'm the city marshal now.
I can stand up to Earp.
You're a joke.
Earp would drop you and a dozen like you quicker than he did Stilwell.
Brocius, you like to drink.
Go to Texas and booze yourself into silence.
Sure.
Warshaw?
I've been to Texas, Mr. Clanton.
If you want me to go, I'll go, but I can find a spot right here in the ranch, stay there real quiet, and just not go no place.
The city marshal can't just disappear.
Business trip.
That'll take money.
You've had all the money you're going to get out of me. Find it somewhere else.
I can't go, lke.
The talking's over, Spence.
What do you think you're doing?
Marshal Spence heard some of you people been wearing guns.
We have orders to find out.
Whose orders?
Marshal Spence.
We're his deputies.
Where is the marshal?
I wanna talk to him.
- He's out of town.
- Why?
Business trip.
May I have your firearms?
No.
I challenge your authority.
John. John.
That's not gonna get us anywhere now.
After all, they are the law.
You're just playing into their hands.
He's right, John.
I'll let you know when you can pick up your irons.
You won't have it that long.
I'll leave these gentlemen to you.
I can't stand pillars of society when I'm not taking their money.
Here's your posse authorization.
I'm glad to see you.
Gentlemen, this is
Sherman McMasters from Tucson.
Anson Safford.
John.
Now, what do they want?
They've got what they wanted.
Our guns.
Spence's men ordered us disarmed.
Where is Spence?
Out of town.
On business.
Well, it's Spence's duty just as it was Virgil's to disarm you.
You're not defending Spence?!
Just the law.
What were you doing wearing a gun, John?
That mob of Clanton's armed to the teeth.
I want to arm a hundred men, organize a vigilante's committee, back you, take this town away from Clanton!
They're legally elected.
Till they step out of line, neither you nor I have a right to touch them.
If we do... you said it in court... you've got anarchy.
All right.
What do you think we should do?
Just sit tight.
Clanton's got a murder warrant out on you for Stilwell's death.
Bryan's got a posse together to serve it.
Let him.
He hasn't got a case.
You can get it kicked out of court, can't you?
You won't be alive long enough to get to court.
Do you know that for a fact?
The way I see it, if Clanton actually wants you arrested and taken to jail, these deputies could do it easily right now.
I don't see 'em moving.
I know it's against your principles to run away from the law, but under the circumstances, my advice to you right now is... start movin'.
I think you're right, Horace.
Don't think I don't appreciate your offer, John.
Sherm, the situation has changed here.
Bryan's got his posse on my tail.
Clum feels they're gonna try to kill me.
They'll have to catch up with us first.
That's what I mean.
You got a wife and children.
I had 'em when I started.
There's a water station about 20 miles up the line. We'll drop off there.
You get us outfitted and meet us there.
I'll meet you there, too.
I'm gonna raise a posse for you... not the kind you'd come up with...
...but it'll be a posse.
Wyatt...
Damnit, I hate to see you make a wrong move here.
Let me organize the vigilante's committee.
Just say the word.
No. But thank you, John.
You sure got cheated on that table.
I know you can draw before I can raise this up. Go on! Get it over with!
I got no such thing in mind, Jack.
I wasn't duckin' out on you, Doc.
I know I owe you 800.
I just been saving up, that's all.
Sure. What would I want with a lousy $6.50 anyway?
You see, the thing is...
I'm in the hole for another thousand with Bill Rayner.
So there wouldn't be much point in shootin' a bankrupt.
That's it. You'd just be gettin' yourself a lot of trouble with Bill.
He'd be sore as hell at you if you was to kill me and me still owin' him all that money.
Supposin' we go for a little walk?
I'd sooner you give it to me right here.
Put that thing away.
That's for the drinks and the table.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear to enforce the laws of the United States of America and the territory of Arizona to the best of your abilities, so help you God?
Well, you must be out of your mind.
- Say, "I do."
- I do.
You are now a Deputy Federal Marshal.
I am?
There's $15,000 reward money in this.
Spence, Brocius, and Warshaw.
Dead or alive?
Arrest and conviction.
The way you handle a gun, you're lucky that's the way it is.
- When do I start?
- Right now.
All right, you men.
Off the wagons. Off the wagons!
Get your tools.
Let's go! Let's move out!
Pick it up! Pick it up!
All right, you men.
Let's go. Let's go.
All right, let's get the lead out.
Let's move!
All right, let's get it in there!
Pretty dangerous fellas you got here.
Might scorch you with one of them headlamps.
Hello, Doc.
A gunslinger like you bullying miners.
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
I have to make a living.
You don't have to make it busting mining strikes.
That's what they pay me for.
I just can't make it as a hired gun in the west anymore.
Well...
Ike Clanton's hirin' guns right now.
I wouldn't raise a finger against the Earps.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.
- Wyatt staked you, didn't he?
- After I got outta jail.
- So? He still staked ya.
- He sent me to jail!
- You still owe him a favor.
- I did him a favor.
I didn't hire my gun to Clanton.
No, you just used it to push poor miners around.
Well... you don't expect me to work, do ya?
Raise your right hand.
What for?
I'm gettin' up a posse.
- Against Clanton?
- That's right.
Why should I?
That's a foolish question.
Yeah.
And there's $15,000 reward money in it.
Do you solemnly swear to uphold the laws of the United States of America and the territory of Arizona to the best of your abilities, so help you God?
- I do.
- You are now a Deputy Federal Marshal.
Follow me.
Texas Jack Vermillion, this is Turkey Creek Johnson.
How'd he sucker you?
Well, you see,
I owed him this $800.
You sure they're hiding over at Clanton's ranch?
Only one way to find out.
It's right over them mountains, ain't it?
Maybe Wyatt isn't headed for Clanton's ranch at all.
Maybe he's just trying to put a lot of rough ground between that posse of Bryan and us.
Is that possible, Wyatt?
If that's so, we oughta move outta here before we get squeezed in the middle.
I think the boys are trying to tell you it'd be a lot safer if we headed away from Clanton's place.
- Nobody said that.
- Then stop thinking about it!
Wyatt...
Here.
You know who they were?
It was Pete.
Pete Spence.
How many were there?
And where's your shotgun rider?
If we can get him across the river, maybe we can get some help.
Forget it.
Mine payroll.
Why? This isn't
Spence's kind of play.
No, it sure ain't.
It's traveling money.
I got a feeling we'll find Spence down around Guatemala.
I want you boys to stay here and watch for Bryan's posse.
And if he does show?
Hold 'em off if you can.
If you can't, lead 'em off downriver.
Where will you be?
If you have to cut out, I'll meet you at Marshal Kiergan's place in Contention.
Wyatt, Sherm asked,
"Where will you be?"
I'm gonna play a long shot.
No handier than Spence is.
He won't try to horse back over those mountains.
He'll be at Algodones waiting for the eastbound stage.
All right. I'll go with you.
Doc...
I want you to stay here and handle the posse.
Spencer's bound to have some men with him. He wouldn't pull this alone.
I don't expect too much trouble.
Then what are these two bodies doing here?
How come Wyatt don't just admit he wants Spence for himself, same as I would if he killed my brother?
He wants Spence because the law says to get him.
Then do me a favor, will ya, Doc?
As long as he's got no personal feeling about it one way or the other, why don't you just talk him into taking the rest of them alive?
I could really use that reward money.
Doc, you got any idea how to cut out
Bryan and his whole posse?
The time has come to have one.
Hello, Spence.
Waiting for the stage?
Yeah. I'm going on a trip east... on business.
Two men killed on the Naco stage this morning.
The driver, shotgun rider.
Mine payroll was taken.
- Mine payroll?
- Yeah.
When'd that happen?
Oh... half hour,
45 minutes ago.
From the looks of the tracks, there was three or four men involved.
I'm traveling alone.
You don't think I had anything to do with that?
Traveling alone, are you?
Yeah, just, uh...
Just taking a trip east on business.
Both those men got it in the back with a shotgun.
The same way my brothers
Virgil and Morgan got it.
Wyatt, I know how you feel about your brothers, but...
You know how it feels to look down the side of a shotgun...
...at a man's back?
Wyatt, don't try to hang that on me.
There's a federal warrant for your arrest, Vince.
I was acquitted in court once,
I'll be acquitted again.
- I had nothing to do with it.
- You had nothing to do with that stage?
Nothing!
Charlie.
Okay.
I see you boys made it all right.
Where's Marshal Kiergan?
Charlie said he'd be back this evening.
- Did you find Spence?
- He's dead.
Obviously no chance for a formal arrest.
That's right.
Well, now, that leaves
$10,000 on the table.
That's right, Doc.
Keeps this up, we'll all lose money on the deal.
Mine payroll?
Yeah. Sherm, you'd better take charge of this.
Probably a little short. Spence said he was traveling alone when I found him.
What next?
Now we'll just stay here until we figure
Bryan's posse's moved on.
Well, you've already had a busy day.
What?
Nothin'.
Hey, Charlie!
Come 'ere.
Crack another bottle, will ya?
He says there ain't any more.
How do you know what he's sayin'?
'Cause I told him not to buy any more.
Here's the money you gave him.
A bottle in a bag, a bottle for now, and a shot glass.
Yes, sir.
What can I do for you, sir?
- You know Bill Brocius?
- He was here up till an hour ago.
Any idea where he went?
Yeah. Across the street to the Desert Queen.
Drunk?
He was making the rounds.
Thanks.
Just make sure you're not so free giving out information about me.
I don't even know who you are, sir.
Very sloppy riding, Brocius.
I remember seeing something like this in the circus...
...once when I was a child.
They lifted up the canvas, and there they were... statues.
Any of you gentlemen... want not to be statues?
He's drunk, Holliday.
So am I.
Now, let me see.
Oh, yes.
By authority vested in me by the government of the United States and the territory of Arizona... you, Curly Bill Brocius...
First unhook your gun belt.
You did that deliberately.
What are you so sore about?
You got Brocius, didn't you?
That's what you wanted.
Killing Brocius is gonna lead Bryan right to us.
We can't move by surprise now.
You fixed that, Doc.
Yeah.
Well, everybody has their bad luck.
I cough when I drink.
You come up against sneaky people... who get you to help them commit suicide.
Get your horse, Doc.
Look what's comin'.
Play dead.
Get your gear and a horse, Warshaw.
You're under arrest.
For what?
Get his horse.
Put a blanket roll on it.
But for why?
For felonious assault and murder...
...to Virgil and Morgan Earp.
I didn't do either of those.
You were seen.
Well, I swear to you
I didn't do 'em.
What did you do?
I only watched to see that no one came.
From the barbershop?
Around the corner from your brother Virgil only.
I wasn't in the barbershop with the guns.
What did you do when Morgan was shot?
Again, I only watched.
Where?
In the alley behind the billiard parlor.
Why'd you watch?
Well... to see that the men with the guns were left alone.
Clanton pay you for that?
Well, sure.
He always pays me.
I work here for Clanton.
What'd he pay?
Oh, hell.
If I told you that...
What'd he pay?
He paid...
...$50 to me.
Before or after?
After.
Clanton ain't so free with his money.
A man's life... $50.
I'm gonna give you a chance to make another $50.
I don't want such a chance.
My men'll stay back.
I'm gonna count,
"One, two, three."
You can draw on two,
I'll wait till three.
If you get me, my boys won't bother you.
Who knows?
Maybe...
Maybe Clanton'll pay you another $50.
Wyatt, he can plug you.
He's too scared.
For God's sake, Wyatt, you got men watching you.
He's gonna draw first.
I don't wanna shoot anybody.
I didn't shoot.
I only watched. to see my brother shot.
One. Two. Three.
Take him back to his boss.
Well, it's the end of the line.
Sorry about the reward money.
You don't hear any complaints, do ya?
I owe you money.
You don't have call to talk to us like that, Wyatt.
I'm sorry, Sherman.
I wanna thank you boys.
Boy, you sure gave him a chance.
I'd just blown his head off as he lay in bed.
You better have one.
- I don't need it.
- Oh, yes, you do.
You need it to make this morning stay down, just like I do.
God... when I think back...
Five minutes after we left the OK Corral,
I wanted to say,
"Get Clanton, Wyatt.
Get him before he gets you."
But I didn't.
You don't... speak that way to Wyatt Earp.
You got too much respect for him.
Then Virgil got it... and then Morgan...
And I watched you keep your word to that waiter back in Tombstone.
You thought it was your honor that stopped you from making him testify, but it wasn't.
You couldn't get a conviction in a Federal court or a local one, and you never intended to try!
You just didn't wanna be cheated out of this!
And those aren't warrants you got there.
Those are hunting licenses...
Stilwell, Spence...
That was a pretty good shot you made at Brocius. God!
That's when I hooked it all together.
And now Warshaw, and then you're gonna get Clanton.
You're gonna kill Clanton just like I would, and you don't need a warrant for that.
So go on.
Go on, have one.
If you're gonna kill like me, you might as well drink like me!
That's all right.
This stops.
I'm taking you to Colorado.
Sorry to spoil your party.
- Mr. Clanton...
- Don't tell me. I've heard it.
Bryan, Earp and the rest of that crowd will be heading for Colorado by now.
Well... that does it, then.
Doesn't it?
I mean, he can't operate from Colorado.
I expect you to be waiting at the border for him.
Might be a little tough to do, lke.
Your posse outnumbers Earp's five to one. What are you worried about?
I thought having him out of the way was all you needed.
I need Wyatt Earp dead and cold, and nothing seems to get that for me.
I've been doing the best I can, lke!
Well, then get back to it!
If you don't get Earp at the border before he moves into Colorado,
I want you to get to the governor for papers to extradite him!
Where will you be?
I'll get back to you when I need you.
Something you wanna say?
No.
Good morning, Mr. Earp.
Welcome to Denver.
Thank you.
I put you in the room next door to your friends.
Thank you.
Has Bryan got to the governor?
Have I been extradited? What?
Bryan's finished.
Who managed that?
Well, Bryan and Clanton had over a hundred men between them.
Clanton left town...
...and we bought the rest of the men off.
You bribed them?
I wouldn't put it that way, but if you want to... yes.
Where is Clanton?
Mexico.
Doing what?
I should judge stealing cattle, Wyatt.
Prospering?
Yes.
What part of Mexico is he in?
Somewhere out of Nogales.
Wyatt, we want you back in Tombstone.
We've got an appointment for you as Chief U.S. Marshal.
We're growing, Wyatt.
And you can grow with us.
Grow to what?
Adjutant-General of the territory.
That would make you chief law enforcement officer in Arizona... and that could be just the beginning for you.
Do I have to give you a yes or no right now?
Well, we can't stall the answer to Washington for too long.
I'll have to give you my answer later, gentlemen.
Thanks for the drink.
We'll hear from you?
I said you would.
Once again.
How am I?
If you put pipes on those lungs, you could play a hymn. Terrible.
But I've been following your orders... rest, fresh air, fresh eggs...
Go on.
You know, you don't have to get well to please me.
I'm used to people dying on me.
So am I!
Don't laugh too hard.
Those lung scars won't stand it.
My friend, if you don't give up drinking, you'll go like that.
I'll say this for you... you got one hell of a bedside manner.
Put him back in the icebox.
That's terrible stuff.
I wouldn't drink that if I were you.
Doc.
It's cold out here.
I'll send for blankets and a wheelchair.
I'd like you to try it for a while.
Don't ask for sympathy from me.
You're doing this to yourself.
Come on, you didn't come all the way out here to get on my back.
No...
Solomon and a few of the others were back at the hotel when I got there.
I have to go back to Tombstone.
They extradited you?
No. They want me to be Chief U.S. Marshal.
Well...
Are they gonna give you enough manpower to operate against Bryan?
Bryan is finished.
And Clanton?
He's high-tailed it for Mexico.
How'd they swing all this?
They bought their men off.
You approve?
It's done.
If it's so easy, why didn't they do it before?
Too expensive.
That's what I like about your friends... idealists.
Are you gonna take the marshal's appointment?
Yeah.
You know, this could lead to me being the Adjutant-General of the territory.
I wouldn't leave you for anything less than that. I figured you'd understand.
I do. I understand. You're a bigger rat than I thought you were.
Probably.
You gonna be all right here?
Yeah, except for a slight dying spell.
I'll see you at Tombstone.
Absolutely.
Hey... listen,
I wanna give this to the doctor.
Oh, no. Here.
Give it to me.
Amazing thing... modern life.
I'm going south to Nogales, you're going west to Tombstone, and we're both on the same train.
Train fare was $18.65.
I'm keeping the rest for expenses.
I believed you were going back to Tombstone.
I did... for about five seconds.
Then it popped into my head...
Clanton.
Still Clanton, isn't it?
Lay off it, Doc.
You let me have it once... that's enough.
We don't have the only law in the world.
They've got law in Mexico.
I'm going to the federales, and if Clanton is operating down there, I'll bring him back.
The next stop, you use your expense money.
Buy a return ticket and go take care of yourself.
No, thank you.
Buenos dias.
Hello, Latigo.
- He said that...
- Yeah. I know what he said, captain.
Just in case he didn't tell you, they have tried to arrest us before.
Yeah, but never for stealing
Mexican government cattle before.
Whose cattle?
- Whose cattle?
- Clanton.
And you...
Who hired you to drive these cattle?
Clanton.
Go get your warrant.
- Lieutenant.
- Senor.
Gracias.
- Hello.
- Hello, Captain.
Sit down, please.
The purpose of my sending for you is unfortunate.
Well, let's have it.
The two witnesses we took with the cattle this morning are dead one hour ago... of guns through the bars of the jail.
Those who shot escaped into the night.
And Clanton?
We will bring him in to be questioned as we will find those who killed, but you understand for Clanton there could be no arrest under the circumstances.
Yeah, I understand.
Without the two witnesses, there could be no trial.
Thank you, Captain.
I tried to notify you of this immediately because perhaps you're now in some danger.
Thanks for your kindness.
- Doc?
- Yeah?
You were right about Warshaw and the others.
Now you can be right about Clanton.
Clanton's different, Wyatt.
Warshaw was in anger.
But you're planning this one without the law.
You're throwing away all the years you lived by the rules.
I don't care about the rules anymore.
I'm not that much of a hypocrite.
The whole thing's hypocrisy.
The rules they've tacked on say unless you're wearin' that badge or a soldier's uniform, you can't kill.
But they're the only rules there are.
And they're more important to you than you think.
Play it that way, Wyatt...
...or you'll destroy yourself.
I know you.
You can't live like me.
Virg played it by the rules.
He's crippled for life.
Morgan... dead.
I can't let Clanton get away with that.
I know where to find him...
I'm gonna find him.
Doc...
Go back to the hotel.
Take care of yourself.
No, thanks.
You got some kind of plan?
I have.
You wanna tell me about it?
We take whoever gets in our way.
You call that a plan?
You got a better one?
No.
Morning.
Good morning.
Doc.
Too bad I'm not feeling better.
Too bad you don't listen to your doctor.
I should've listened to my mother in Baltimore.
Wyatt?
When we were down with the federales...
...when I said about your not being able to go back, I...
Well, that was talk.
But I have to know something.
Are you going back to Tombstone?
Sure.
Don't lie to me this time.
I'm going back.
That's what I had to know.
Hey, do me a favor, will you?
Sure, Doc.
Get outta here.
Go on. Don't hang around.
All right, Doc.
Wyatt?
Yeah?
So long.
So long, now.
Thank you, Doctor.
I'll be in touch with you.
You'll be in Denver or Tombstone?
I'm not gonna be in either place, Charles.
When he... where will you be?
I don't know, but I'm not gonna be in this part of the country.
Well, Clum told me you got the appointment... U.S. Marshal.
I'm not gonna accept it, Charles.
I'm through with the law.
I wanna thank you for coming up here.
So long, Charley.
God! That's terrible.
Where do you get that stuff?
Kings.
Aces.
Hey!
If you want any tickets, you'll have to go around to the front of...
Well, I suppose it'll be all right.
What the hell am I doing around here?
They walk in here and...
Let's see. I hope I got...
Three?
That'll be $7...
...and 50 cents.
No.
Frank?
Frank sent us.
Did you bring a horse for me?
Well, looks like we're...
Looks like we're shy one horse.
You brought two too many.
Hey, Pa!
Look!
That's enough for now.
It's getting late. Come on home.
Timmy.
Maureen, look.
What you doing there?
Go inside, quick, and get washed.
And don't touch the apple pie or the roast.
Patrick's already left for the station, huh?
He's getting ready, Pa.
-Damn it, Patrick!
-Coming, Pa.
Not bad, I'd say.
Bigger, them slices. What the hell?
We're throwing a party, ain't we?
But these are the same slices as usual.
Yeah, sure.
As usual.
Maureen.
Soon, you can cut the bread in slices as big as a door if you want to.
You'll have beautiful new clothes and you won't have to work no more.
We're going to get rich, Pa?
Who knows?
Patrick!
Wait a minute!
Look at the filth on your boots.
Clean them.
The train will come in and there won't be no one to meet your mother.
Our mother died six years ago.
Go now, or you'll really be late.
Just a minute. Listen, Pa.
How am I gonna recognize her?
You can't make no mistake, Patrick.
She's young and she's pretty and she's a lady.
"For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress
"and the same straw hat that I was wearing when we met."
I'm gonna get some fresh water from the well.
Oh, Danny boy
The pipes, the pipes are calling
And down the mountain side
The summer's gone
And all the roses fall.-.
Maureen!
What are we gonna do with this one, Frank?
Now that you've called me by name...
I saw some mighty fine stock down south.
Is that so?
And the prices are good.
-These your valises, ma'am?
-Yes.
-Come, Sarah.
-Bring them other two.
We'll tote them for you, ma'am.
Is that true? The sawmill needs hands?
-Was yesterday.
-Why didn't you tell your brother?
-Hiya, Gramps.
-Hiya, Bill. We're back again.
Come on. Get a move on, will you?
Get the lead out of your asses, you redskin warriors.
I got a whole train to unload.
All right, chuck down those feed sacks first.
Come on! Come on!
What's the name of the place you wanted to go?
Sweetwater.
Brett McBain's farm.
McBain? Yeah, sure.
That stubborn redheaded Irishman, tilling sand for years way out there in the middle of nowhere.
Sweetwater!
Only a loony like him could call that stinking piece of desert
Sweetwater.
Sweetwater!
That's good! Sweetwater!
That's right. A little more to the right.
Higher. Higher.
Hold it there.
Here they are.
Even got here with their damn rails.
They caught up with us again, eh, Lafayette? Let's go!
Hey, slow down.
What's the matter with you? Slow down!
Hey, boys! Watch out!
Watch out down there!
Slow down!
Why are we stopping?
I told you I was in a hurry.
Don't the train stop?
What can I do for you, ma'am?
I would like some water, if it's no trouble.
Water?
Well, you see, that word is poison around these parts ever since the days of the great flood.
-You mean you never wash?
-We sure do!
I'd like to use the same facilities you people do.
You sure can.
Just happen to have a full tub in the back.
And you're lucky.
Only three people have used it this morning.
Used it one at a time or all together?
I can tell you're accustomed to fine living.
Bet you come from one of those big eastern cities.
-New Orleans.
-New Orleans!
-You've been there?
-No.
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.
You know, she...
Jug.
Do you only know how to play or do you know how to shoot?
Do you know how to blow music from that?
Pick it up.
You!
You don't know how to play.
Try this one.
Take it.
Go on.
Here.
Bravo.
Cheyenne.
We thought we'd never make it.
It's all right. You're right on time.
To bury my escort.
If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.
Hey.
The gun.
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?
I saw three of these dusters a short time ago.
They were waiting for a train.
Inside the dusters, there were three men.
So?
Inside the men, there were three bullets.
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.
For two reasons.
One, nobody around these parts got the guts to wear those dusters except Cheyenne's men.
Two, Cheyenne's men don't get killed.
That surprise you?
Yeah.
Well, you know music.
And you can count.
All the way up to two.
All the way up to six, if I have to.
And maybe faster than you.
Yeah, go on.
Play, Harmonica.
Play, so you can't bullshit.
Only, watch those false notes.
Like so?
And so, this cousin of mine keeps writing me to come on down to New Orleans.
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."
I don't think I'd get along in a big city.
It's too full of fast men and loose women.
Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.
Now, I'm too used to a quiet, simple country life.
He's Timmy.
Yes.
Dear God.
On the day...
On the very day of your wedding.
Poor little miss.
Mrs...
Mrs. McBain.
But we all... But we thought...
I know.
It was to be a surprise today.
Brett McBain and I were married.
A month ago.
In New Orleans.
"I am the resurrection, and the life.
"He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live.
"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."
Amen.
-Mr. Bennett!
-What's he doing here?
I found this collar on a nail by the door.
You got no way of knowing, but this is as good as a signature.
Cheyenne's hand.
-But why?
-Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.
We'll make them tell us before we hang them.
Let's get moving.
Come on.
Let's go back to Flagstone.
No, Sam.
You go back.
You don't want to stay out here alone.
Why not?
This is my home.
You know, Wobbles,
I'm kind of mad at you.
Frank wasn't there.
He sent three friends.
I don't know nothing, I swear.
I only arranged the meeting the way you wanted it.
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.
-I swear to you that I...
-'Cause he was at the McBains'.
That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.
Everyone knows that. We got proof.
That was always one of Frank's tricks.
Faking evidence.
I don't know.
I swear.
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.
I don't know nothing.
Who's there?
Did you make coffee?
Make it.
Didn't sleep a wink.
A pack of turds dressed in black rode herd on me the whole damn night.
Yeah, but I left them in the middle of the desert.
If they're lucky, they'll be home in three days.
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.
They want to hang me, the big black crows.
Idiots.
What the hell?
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.
Be like killing a priest.
A Catholic priest, that is.
Yeah, the world is full of people who hate Cheyenne.
See, I ain't the mean bastard people make out.
Of course, if somebody had a mind to kill me, it fires me up.
And a fired-up Cheyenne ain't a nice thing to see.
Especially for a lady.
But you're too smart to make him mad.
So this here's where I was supposed to do all the killing?
Yeah.
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.
Now, if somebody gets dressed up to look like me, so they can hang this thing around my neck,
I don't like it none.
But I can understand it.
What I don't understand is why.
Neither do I.
But I see you looked a lot for the why.
Yeah.
What if there were a whole heap of whys?
Round. Yellow.
You know the kind.
You rap them on a stone and they go "ding."
Maybe.
But I didn't find them.
By the way, you know anything about a man going around playing a harmonica?
He's somebody you'd remember.
Instead of talking, he plays.
And when he'd better play, he talks.
You know, ma'am, when you've
Killed four, it's easy to make it five.
Sure. You're an expert.
Ma'am, it seems to me you ain't caught the idea.
Of course I have.
I'm here alone in the hands of a bandit who smelled money.
If you want to, you can lay me over the table and amuse yourself.
And even call in your men.
Well, no woman ever died from that.
When you're finished, all I'll need will be a tub of boiling water, and I'll be exactly what I was before.
With just another filthy memory.
You make good coffee, at least?
Not bad.
Congratulations.
Tell me, was it necessary that you kill all of them?
I only told you to scare them.
People scare better when they're dying.
And can you tell me what good was your stupid massacre?
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.
Let's say this is something
I didn't plan on.
I have no time for surprises, Frank.
You know that.
I got on board in sight of the Atlantic, and before my eyes rot,
I want to see the blue of the Pacific outside that window.
I know where you got on board.
I was there, too, remember?
"To remove small obstacles from the track," you said.
Well, there were a few.
But we traveled a long way, just the same.
And fast.
Even tuberculosis of the bones travels fast.
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.
I knew you when you were just barely limping.
I watch that dry rot rise a little more every day.
Any normal man would put a bullet in his brain.
But you, you just got a little more hasty.
Otherwise you ain't changed any.
I'd say you've changed, Frank.
A lot.
You used to take care of certain things personally.
Now, you're keeping in the background.
You'll end up giving orders.
It's because, now, I don't want to leave you alone too much.
You're gonna need somebody more and more every day to stay near you.
-Like a friend.
-Or like a partner.
How does it feel sitting behind that desk, Frank?
It's almost like holding a gun.
Only much more powerful.
You see, staying with you,
I'm beginning to think big, too.
This McBain business has given me ideas.
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.
You'll never succeed in becoming like me.
Why?
Because there are many things you'll never understand.
This is one of them.
You see, Frank, there are many kinds of weapons.
And the only one that can stop that is this.
Now, shall we get back to our little problem?
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton, but they can still shoot holes big enough for our little problems.
Pretty soon the widow McBain won't be a problem no more.
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.
"From now on, there are no more surprises."
And then you happen to meet a man like this, who looked like a good man.
Clear eyes, strong hands.
And he wants to marry you.
Which doesn't happen often.
And he says he's rich, too, which doesn't hurt.
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans.
"Now I'll say yes and go live in the country.
"I wouldn't mind giving him half a dozen kids after all.
"Take care of a house.
Do something. What the hell?"
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.
Even if he's going to have a job pulling you out of the devil's grip.
Still, I swear he'd left money around someplace.
If you can find it, you're welcome to it.
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.
Minus a husband and plus a great future.
You deserve better.
The last man who told me that is buried out there.
You know, Jill, you remind me of my mother.
She was the biggest whore in Alameda and the finest woman that ever lived.
Whoever my father was, for an hour or for a month, he must have been a happy man.
Hey! Hey!
Hey!
What do you want?
Cheyenne's right.
Once you've killed four, it's easy to make it five.
This isn't the time to leave.
Give me some water-
From the well.
I like my water fresh.
When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground.
A sound? Like what?
Like that.
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.
Morning, Mrs. McBain.
-What brings you to town?
-Good morning.
Maybe you don't remember, but yesterday at the funeral...
I remember very well.
Is there something I can do for you?
Yes.
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.
Why is everybody hounding me about this guy Frank?
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.
I got my own worries, and all I want is to be left in peace.
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him.
Personally.
You were told not to come here for any reason.
Whatever business you have with Frank, keep it far away from here.
Yes, I know, Mr. Morton, but when I heard that woman say she knew everything,
I thought that the important thing was for me to come over here right away and tell you about it.
You never thought it wasn't a trick?
Sure, but you know that I'm mighty careful, Frank.
No one could have followed me.
That's the first thing I learned, working for you.
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.
You should learn to live as if you didn't exist.
You've known me a long time, Frank.
You know you can trust me.
Wobbles.
How can you trust a man who wears both a belt and suspenders?
The man can't even trust his own pants.
Let's get out of here.
The end of the line.
Yeah.
Get him on board.
Tie him up.
Wait, Frank.
I didn't. ..
So, nobody followed you?
No. You gotta believe me.
So, this is the way I can trust you.
I can explain. I didn't know that he...
-Get out.
-No. No. No, Frank.
Get out.
Frank, wait!
I told you to keep quiet.
Where are Logan and Jim?
They take care of the woman?
Someone took care of them.
We found them out at McBain's place.
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.
Your friends have a high mortality rate, Frank.
First three, then two.
So you're the one who makes appointments.
And you're the one who doesn't keep them.
What do you want?
Who are you?
Dave Jenkins.
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.
Calder Benson.
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.
You ought to know, Frank, better than anyone.
You killed him.
Who are you?
-Who are you, you...
-Frank!
The woman.
We're only losing time.
All right.
This time,
I'll take care of her personally.
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.
Keep him warm for me.
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.
By the way, I want you to keep an eye on that cripple all the time.
-Understand?
-Sure, Frank.
-See anyone?
-No.
There he is.
You only know how to shoot?
Or do you know how to cut, too?
Hey, you.
Wait a minute.
Let's have a good look at you.
Hey. Mr. Choo-Choo.
It's easy to find you.
Bastard.
I don't have to kill you now.
You leave a slime behind you like a snail.
Two beautiful shiny rails.
There's another bastard.
And he's getting further away every minute.
There it is.
Exactly what your husband ordered from me.
And seeing as how he paid cash on the barrelhead, it all belongs to you.
Oak planks, beech, pine.
All first-grade lumber.
And there's beams and foundation pylons.
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar, and all these tools.
Maybe he wanted to enlarge the farmhouse.
Enlarge the farmhouse?
He could have built at least eight of them.
By the way, ma'am,
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.
Only it seems he forgot to tell me what he wanted printed on it.
Station.
How's that again?
I said print "station."
Looking for this?
I've had enough of your butcher tactics.
I know that woman is here.
I don't want any more useless killing.
I'm ready to make a deal for that land.
To pay what's necessary.
I don't want to waste any more time.
You've made a big mistake, Morton.
When you're not on that train, you look like a turtle out of its shell.
Just funny.
Poor cripple talking big so nobody will know how scared you are.
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.
I don't have time to compete with you.
Compete?
Why, you...
You can't even stand on your own feet by yourself.
Ls that sufficient to make you feel stronger?
I could squash you like a wormy apple.
Sure, but you won't do it.
Because it's not to your advantage.
Who knows how far you'd have gone with two good legs.
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.
Morton. Don't worry about the land.
If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.
Of course, it won't make any difference to you dealing with the new owner.
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!
There's a square staked out here.
It says "water tank."
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office."
And this one says "corral."
And this here "church."
What the hell is this?
Can't you see?
It's a station.
And all around it, a town.
Brett McBain's town.
Was he crazy!
Yeah, in a very special way.
An Irishman.
He knew, sooner or later, that railroad coming through Flagstone would continue on west.
So he looked over all this country out here until he found this hunk of desert.
Nobody wanted it.
But he bought it.
Then he tightened his belt, and for years, he waited.
Waited for what?
For the railroad to reach this point.
But how in the hell could he be sure the railroad would pass through his property?
Them steam engines can't roll without water.
And the only water for 50 miles west of Flagstone is right here.
Under this land.
He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?
He was going to sell this piece of desert for its weight in gold, wasn't he?
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.
Brett McBain wanted his station.
He got the rights to build it.
-How do you know all this?
-I saw a document.
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.
One thing, though.
In very small print, there is a short clause, which says that McBain or his heirs lose all rights if, by the time the railroad reaches this point, the station ain't built yet.
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...
Hey.
I noticed the rail gang's already behind those hills.
And before you know it, they're gonna be here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Listen.
Harmonica.
A town built around the railroad.
You could make a fortune, huh?
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Hey, more than that.
Thousands of thousands.
They call them millions.
Millions?
-Yeah, millions.
-Yeah.
I always thought it'd be easier to make a deal with a smart lady.
All you gotta do is...
Hey, what in the hell are you standing around for?
But, chief, what are we supposed to do?
What are you supposed to do?
Build a station, idiots!
I figure it ain't gonna look like much.
But it'll be the first thing she sees when she gets back.
If she gets back.
I think...
Yeah.
I'm beginning to think
I might be a little sorry killing you.
You like being alive.
You also like to feel a man's hands all over you.
You like it.
Even if they're the hands of the man who killed your husband.
What a. ..
What a little tramp.
Is there anything in the world you wouldn't do to save your skin?
Nothing, Frank.
Now I understand why they miss you so much down there in New Orleans.
Great invention, the telegraph.
"Jill? The brunette?
"My God, all the customers
"of the most elegant whorehouse on Bourbon Street
"have been weeping ever since she left."
Say, tell me.
Did old McBain know?
Yeah.
Yeah, I bet he did.
He was just the type to marry a whore.
Hey.
It's an idea.
I could marry you.
And the land would become mine.
And maybe you'd make a perfect wife.
It would be me who wouldn't be any good as a husband.
Too bad.
We'll have to think of another solution.
Simpler.
Quicker.
As sheriff of this county,
I've been asked to preside over the sale by auction of all property belonging to Mrs. Jill McBain, here present.
This parcel of land measures 320 acres.
It's free of all encumbrances, liens and mortgages.
This property and all it contains, lock, stock and barrel, will be turned over to the lucky purchaser at the time of sale.
All the contents therein are listed by number on the inventory sheet distributed among you.
The entire property will be sold in block to the highest bidder.
All right. That's clear to everybody.
I declare the auction open.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?
A list of all the items.
Some of them are worth money.
All right.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?
Well, I have an opening bid of $200.
$200. Do I hear more?
That stinking piece of land ain't worth it.
Is it, old-timer?
Come on, my friends, $200.
The livestock alone is worth twice that much.
Well...
Who's going to bid $3007
Now, look, friends,
I realize we're not offering
California here, but 200 is damn little for all that property.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wouldn't even take 200 as a deposit.
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.
You're sure you wouldn't want to set a minimum price?
I wish I were wrong, Mrs. McBain, but you're liable to end up selling the place for a plate of beans.
All I want is to sell.
-You look fat, huh?
-If you say so.
-How many?
-One card.
One for me.
Dealer takes three.
Can I... Can I take a hand?
Fifteen.
Yeah, sit down.
I'll deal.
How do you...
How do you play this game, Mr. Morton?
It's very simple.
As long as you use your head, you never lose.
Do I hear any other bids?
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain, but I think I'm gonna have to knock down on that last bid.
$500 once.
$500 twice.
-You said $5,000?
-It's on its way.
It's Cheyenne!
The reward for this man is $5,000, that right?
Judas was content with $4,970 less.
There were no dollars in them days.
But sons of bitches, yeah.
Hey, wait a minute.
-The jail's that way.
-Yeah, I know.
Yeah, but you're going to the railroad station.
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.
They got a modern jail there.
It's got more walls, more bars, more guards.
You'll like it, in 20 years. You'll see.
Two tickets, amigo, to the next station.
One way only.
Here's to you. And congratulations.
You got yourself a good deal.
The auction.
Forget it. I don't invest in land.
You don't look at all like the noble defender of poor defenseless widows.
But then again,
I don't look like a poor defenseless widow.
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.
And you're a remarkable man.
But you have something on your mind.
And you got something on your mind.
Hot water. A bathtub full of hot water.
I think it's time I filled that bathtub.
Who are you?
Jim Cooper.
Chuck Youngblood.
More dead men.
They were all alive until they met you, Frank.
You paid $5,000 for something that belongs to me.
Plus one.
You've got a right to make a profit, too.
I wouldn't take too long thinking about it, if I were you.
You got yourself into something that's bigger than you are.
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.
You sound like a real businessman, Frank.
Being with Mr. Morton has done you a lot of good.
And you've learned some new methods.
Yeah, Mr. Morton has shown you a lot of new ways.
Even though you haven't given up the old ones.
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.
Which deal, Frank?
We have more than one, you and me.
We can lump them together into one bundle, settle all of them.
Here and now.
Easy, Frank.
Easy.
You gotta learn not to push things.
Taking it easy is the first thing a businessman should do.
I got an idea Mr. Morton can teach you a lot more.
How much?
Giddy up!
Giddy up!
I could swear we're going to have that strange sound.
Right now.
Time sure flies.
It's already past 12:00.
But... But they were his men.
-Yeah.
-And they tried to kill him.
They must have found somebody who pays better.
And you!
You saved his life.
I didn't let them kill him and that's not the same thing.
Sure.
It's not the same thing.
You get dressed.
It's time to go home.
Did you make coffee?
This time I did.
Good.
My mother used to make coffee this way.
Hot, strong and good.
Cheyenne.
What's he waiting for out there?
What's he doing?
He's whittling on a piece of wood.
I got a feeling when he stops whittling, something's gonna happen.
Surprised to see me here?
I knew you'd come.
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.
Now I understand why.
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing you were around somewhere alive.
So you found out you're not a businessman after all?
Just a man.
An ancient race.
Other Mortons will be along and they'll kill it off.
The future don't matter to us.
Nothing matters now.
Not the land, not the money, not the woman.
I came here to see you.
'Cause I know that now you'll tell me what you're after.
Only at the point of dying.
I know.
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.
Put it there, please.
So I can watch the railroad move up while I shave.
You know what?
If I was you, I'd go down there and give those boys a drink.
You can't imagine how happy it makes a man to see a woman like you.
Just to look at her.
And if one of them should pat your behind, just make believe it's nothing.
They earned it.
Keep your loving brother happy.
Who... Who are you?
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.
But I'm not the right man.
And neither is he.
Maybe not.
But it doesn't matter.
You don't understand, Jill.
People like that have something inside.
Something to do with death.
If that fella lives, he'll come in through that door, pick up his gear and say adiós.
It would be nice to see this town grow.
Now I gotta go.
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.
I hope you'll come back someday.
Someday.
Yeah. I gotta go, too.
Make believe it's nothing.
Sorry, Harmonica.
I gotta stay here.
Who?
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.
I didn't count on that half-man from the train.
He got scared.
Hey, Harmonica.
When they do you in, pray it's somebody who knows where to shoot.
Go away.
Go away.
Go away. I don't want you to see me die.
Manuel and Rosa...
lived in the "sertão"...
working the land...
with their own hands.
Until one day...
for better or for worse...
he entered into their lives...
San Sebastián.
He had kindness in his eyes...
and Jesus Christ in his heart.
Rosa,
I saw Saint Sebastian.
He said a miracle will save the world.
Many people were following.
All singing and praying.
Mother doesn't believe me either.
But I saw him!
He looked deep into my eyes.
It's a miracle,
Rosa, a miracle.
Rosa, on Saturday
I'll go to market.
Divide the cattle with (landowner) Moraes.
Maybe I can sell two cows... and buy a piece of land from him.
If it works out we can plant something... to harvest next year.
It's no use.
Who knows...
Times are bad.
Heaven might send us down a miracle.
Yes, Rosa... a miracle could come.
Sebastián was born in the fire...
in the month of February, announcing...
that adversity would burn the whole world.
Because he would save those who followed him...
because he was a miracle-maker Saint...
- Morning, Boss.
- Good morning.
The cows are here, but four of them are dead.
Did they drink water from the North well?
Yes sir, it was the only place.
They were bitten by snakes.
I brought twelve cows.
Maybe we could split the loss.
There's nothing to split, the dead cows were all yours.
But Mr. Moraes the cows had your brand on them.
They couldn't be mine.
I'm a poor man.
It was an accident, but it's true.
The snakes bit your cows.
Don't argue!
The law is on my side.
Excuse me, Mr. Moraes but what law?
- Are you arguing with me?
- No, sir.
But what's this law which doesn't protect what's mine?
I've already told you, you're entitled to nothing.
But Mr. Moraes...
- You can't take what's mine.
- Are you calling me a thief?
You yourself are doing so!
Now you'll learn!
My son, your mother is dead.
Not by God's hand.
By a mercenary's gun during... a fight in the backlands.
I knew it, Rosa.
You didn't believe me... but it was the hand of God led me to the Devil.
We'll have to go to Monte Santo... and ask for St. Sebastian's protection.
Come on now... we've nothing to take with us but our destiny.
It was Don Pedro Alvares Cabral who discovered Brazil.
He had his cavalry built of stone and blood.
This pilgrimage to Monte Santo... will open the gates of Heaven... to the bodies and souls of the innocent.
I have walked to more than 100 places... telling everyone that the world will end up in this drought... with fire that will sprout from the rocks to burn the world.
The lords of this land... the authorities and the farmers... they all said I was lying... and that the sun would be to blame for this disaster.
Last year I said we'd have
100 days without rain... and we had them!
Now I tell you...
On the other side of this holy mountain... there is a bountiful land.
The horses eat flowers.
Children drink milk out of the rivers.
And rocks turn into bread.
Dust becomes flour.
There's water and food, the abundance of Heaven.
And every day when the sun rises...
Jesus Christ and the
Virgin can be seen... and Saint George.
And my Saint Sebastian... his chest bristling with arrows.
We must show the authorities... the power and force of the Saint.
They removed Dom Pedro from his throne, and now try to kill those who love the Emperor.
But those who wish to save their souls... must follow me from now on... until the day when God's sign appears in the sky.
A hundred angels with their swords of fire, shall come to herald our departure, and open our way through the darkness of the backlands.
The land will become the sea and the sea the land.
A man shouldn't be another man's slave.
He must leave the land that doesn't belong to him, so that he can reach the fields of Heaven.
The poor will be rich... and will sit on the right side of God.
The rich will be poor and stand on the left side of the Devil.
We shall not be alone, because the Lord has sent down warring angel, to cut out the heads of our enemies.
I'm condemned but have courage.
I give my strength to my Saint so he can free my people.
The Lord be praised.
Do you still remember me?
I don't remember anything.
Neither the night nor the day.
We lived together.
Back on the farm.
We've been here in
Monte Santo for a long time.
You're following Sebastian and you left me behind.
I have to be alone to reach the Sacred Island.
I must leave behind wife and children.
We'll stay one year in Monte Santo... waiting for the rain of gold.
Then we'll go to an island in the middle of the sea... and we'll let the fire from the sky burn this...
Republic of disgrace, once and for all.
The Island doesn't exist.
We have it inside our souls.
If it doesn't exist... why must we search for it all our lives?
You have come to be my strength in peace and war.
You must fight for me.
The Island doesn't exist.
Yes it does.
I saw it at the bottom of the river.
Sebastian said the island doesn't exist... and that we must live in pain.
I was behind you.
I heard.
You're lying.
You and all the others are faithless and damned... but I'm going to survive and be king.
My cattle will graze in a green pasture.
That's a dream.
The earth is dry and will never bear any fruit.
Why must you be sick with hope?
Let us leave this place and make a living elsewhere... before the Army arrives... and does the same as they did in Canudos... killing men, women and children.
If there is a war...
I'll fight a thousand soldiers with Saint George's spear.
If the people of Santo die,
I'll create the island.
You shall die.
I shall die.
No one will escape.
Fate is greater than death.
There's gold in the sea beyond.
Rocks turn into bread, and horses eat flowers.
You walk in the dark.
Lost in this dry world
Under no God or Devil
There goes Antonio das Mortes
The killer of the 'cangaceiro' highwaymen.
Since Sebastian came, the church has earned nothing... from christenings and weddings.
Sebastian is dangerous to both farmers... and the church.
The Government doesn't help us.
I always said we have two laws here:
The Government law, and the law of the bullet.
I never won an election through votes.
If the strong don't unite, they'll destroy everything.
To kill a 'cangaceiro' is dangerous, but it's easy.
We all remember Canudos.
The troops came to fight Conselheiro.
We all thought it'd be child's play... and look what happened.
We mustn't let Sebastian become another Conselheiro.
Personally,
I'm not afraid of wars.
I've always lived with them.
But you know it's dangerous to interfere in holy matters.
Sebastian is a nenemy of the church.
But the people around him are Christians.
I haven't seen for myself... but apparently he can work miracles.
Well now.
Only you can do it.
We'll give you 300 contos to rid us of the beatified.
Christ drove moneylenders out of His temple with a whip.
The example is in the Gospel.
So, Antonio?
Do you accept?
300 Contos.
It's a lot of money.
It's a small price to pay to get into Hell.
The priest thinks Sebastian has a pact with the devil.
But I think he has a pact with God, too.
Then you must leave here.
Buy a farm, and live in peace for the rest of your life.
This is your penitence,
Antonio.
It is only when you commit a great crime... that you may be forgiven for the crimes you committed.
600 contos.
That's twice what they offered you before.
Tell them they can live in peace.
Sebastian is finished.
From here I can see the sea, and then the Promised Land.
God separated the earth from the sky.
But he was wrong.
When I put them back together... the island will be visible to all.
There will be happiness,
Rosa.
After the backlands, the sea!
You must choose.
Go down there.
Bring your wife and a child.
Only after Rosa's soul is washed, will you be clean.
To govern the island, to govern the island.
My wife has the devil in her!
Tomorrow golden rain will fall.
The land will become the sea... and the sea will become the land!
When we get to the island... we'll clean the souls of the sinners... with the blood of the innocent.
Godfather Sebastian!
Killer of 'cangaceiros'.
Good morning, blind man.
I am Antonio das Mortes.
They all died happy.
They were praying.
I didn't want to kill them, but I had to.
I spared just two, to tell the tale.
And Sebastian?
They killed him.
The people killed the Saint!
On the mount of Monte Santo
Only Manoel survived
By the mercy of Antonio
The killer of 'cangaceiros'
Our story continues
Now, people, pay attention
Manoel and Rosa wandered
Through the backlands
And one day they came upon
Into their lives came
Corisco
The devil Lampião.
I kept my promise to
Father Cicero.
I won't let the poor starve to death!
In the name of Lampião...
I'll avenge the walking and the dead.
It's my Saint George,
Rosa.
Forget all that,
I can't stand seeing you... suffering any longer.
It's been 3 days, that's a long time... for someone fighting a war.
Maria Bonita's body is rotting.
Worms are eating her lovely eyes.
Maria is dead but
Lampião is alive.
His flesh is no more but his spirit is still living.
His spirit is inside me, joined together with mine.
I am a two-headed
'cangaceiro'.
One on the outside, the other on the inside.
One is the killer... the other is the thinker.
We'll see whether a two-headed 'cangaceiro'... can change these backlands.
The dragon of evil swallows the people... to fatten the Republic.
But I borrowed Saint George's spear to slay the evil giant.
Here!
Here's my rifle to save the poor from starving.
Who are you stranger?
I'm a follower of Sebastian.
Where is Sebastian?
Antonio das Mortes killed him.
Filthy Republic! They killed
Sebastian and Lampião!
They killed our protector!
Captain Corisco!
May the Lord be with you!
Drive out the devils from your body.
Who is this stranger?
Drive out the devils, and go in peace.
Where is the priest of Monte Santo?
Antonio das Mortes wiped out the holy people.
Only two were spared.
The others died a long time ago.
Dead?
All dead, a long time ago.
I was so far away that
I wasn't aware of anything.
And how about Lampião?
Don't you know?
He was killed three days ago.
With Maria Bonita and his followers.
No one can imagine what it was like.
My soul is filled with sorrow.
This pain grows like the sun.
And we must stay and remember.
It happened at six o'clock in the afternoon, at Angico.
He was killed at the mouth of the night.
And Maria Bonita at the break of the dawn.
Are there any soldier nearby?
I am waiting for the signal.
I had a dream.
Today we shall die!
Die? How?
You are crazy!
When all was lost!
I saw the Devil's rifle fired twice, once in each eye.
In your eye, Lampião!
Stand aside, who would dare shoot me in the eye?
My body is protected by the Saints.
But I saw the sign.
Death is coming today at sunrise.
Here in our hideout?
Only if you did it, if you betray me I'll kill you.
The others, there, the ones who live with the Devil.
I'm going away.
My time hasn't come yet.
It is your turn.
Let's go men!
Maria!
Avoredo!
Gavião!
Let's move.
I cut off eleven heads at the traitor's farm.
Then I put them in a bag... and sent them as a gift to the police... with a note written in blood.
It was my way of showing them
I'm at war to avenge Lampião's.
But my men were frightened and walked out on me.
Now I am alone... with those two.
Those two against a thousand soldiers.
A thousand soldiers.
Captain Corisco.
I want to join your gang.
I could help this war.
I've nothing to do.
I want to avenge
Sebastian's death.
The Government and the landowners killed him.
Can you fight?
Yes, sir, I can fight.
I've done plenty of raids.
And I can ride,
I used to drive cattle.
Saint George is helping me.
I need a valiant man.
A man like myself.
You look strong.
What's your name?
Manoel.
That's a cowherd's name.
I'll give you another one.
From now on, your name is...
Satan!
Now let's get on with our war against the Government.
See?
See your bride?
Now she's gonna be a 'cangaceiro's' wife.
Satan!
Show you're a brave man.
Cut out this cuckold's manhood.
Leave this war, let's go away.
It's now or never!
Where can I go?
I have to stay, to avenge my sorrow... and do justice.
I'll kill him, Rosa.
Get up, you coward!
Kill me, captain, kill me.
What did you expect when you ran away from home?
Justice! Sebastian promised.
And wasn't I justice?
I thought so.
But can't we comply with the law without shedding blood?
When I was young...
I was chased and beaten like a dog by that man's father.
I have waited twenty years.
I've beheaded people to relieve my woes.
It's no use now.
My fate is so smeared... that all the blood in the world couldn't purge it.
You are like the angels.
If I die, go away with your woman... and spread the word that Corisco... is more dead than alive.
Lampião is dead, and I died with him.
That's why
I must stay standing... fighting to the very end.
Disrupting order.
Until the land turns into the sea
And the sea into the land
Wandering with remorse
Antonio das Mortes
Comes looking night and day
Corisco of Saint George
Comes looking night and day
Corisco of Saint George
Comes looking night and day
Who are you?
Have you forgotten my voice?
Antonio das Mortes
I've been tracking you for over a week.
I just wanted to ask you:
Where is the man
I spared in Monte Santo?
The cowherd who killed Moraes.
Remember?
Yes, sir.
Haven't heard of him in a long time.
People saw him fighting alongside Corisco last week.
Tell me the truth:
Isn't that cowherd the same one they call Satan?
And wasn't it you led him to Corisco?
I think destiny turned out well.
I couldn't drag Manoel and Rosa along with me the whole time.
The destiny of a 'cangaceiro'!
Antonio, do you see clearly ahead of you?
I see the vast backlands of
Canudos.
In these backlands, I can see the blood of Conselheiro's.
They all died fighting the Army.
In the gloom of my blindness.
I can't understand why you hunt Corisco.
No one questions me!
I must fulfill my destiny.
Without a thought nor pity.
Blind man Julio, tell me, who killed the saint at the church?
You can't ask such questions, one forgets such things.
Who killed him?
Was it Manoel?
Didn't you say the people did it?
I lied.
I couldn't believe it.
It was the hand ofjealousy.
Rosa killed Manoel's faith.
They're both doomed.
I'll kill them one way or another.
Corisco's very tired.
Don't kill Corisco either.
I'll kill him. I'll hunt him down to the end.
Is killing your way of loving your neighbor, Antonio?
Sebastian asked me that, too.
I didn't want to do it, but I had to.
I didn't slaughter those people for money.
I killed them because I can have no peace with this misery.
It's not the people's fault,
Antonio!
Some day a greater war will burn these backlands.
A great war without the fear of God or the Devil.
Maybe that war will start soon.
I who killed Sebastian will kill Corisco.
And then I'll kill myself.
Because we are of the same blood.
Antonio das Mortes is close by and told me to warn you.
Do you hear that,
Corisco?
He's near.
Let's leave!
I can only find peace in death... in Heaven, surrounded by angels.
Listen, Corisco, whoever dies is finished!
Antonio himself said your head will roll on the ground.
The Saints protect me.
I'm waiting for Antonio das
Mortes, to fight man to man... as God would against the Devil.
Corisco faces the powerful dragon.
If I die, another will be born... for no one can slay Saint
George, the Saint of the people.
And I'll die for you, captain.
Weren't Sebastian and Lampião the same?
That's blasphemy.
Don't blaspheme!
Sebastian was greater than Lampião.
Don't you dare compare them or I'll kill you.
Anthing more to say?
I'm not afraid.
We had been defeated at Razo de Catarina.
I carried Lampião on my back.
Ezequiel! Levino!
Antonio!
All your brothers are dead, Lampião.
Of your race, you alone are still alive.
The souls of your friends are wandering alone.
I broke everything and nothing has appeared.
Nor ever will!
After I kill the others,
I'll kill myself.
We only find that kind of peace in death.
I have my doubts about death, Corisco.
We wandered day and night... until we found
Sebastian... alone and hungry.
Without his sword... he was following
Jesus Christ's example.
He helped Lampião.
He tended his wounds.
He wanted him to stop thieving, so he wouldn't die.
Lampião asked for Father
Cicero's protection.
You know what Sebastian answered?
That Father Cicero was an enemy of God.
That he was God!
He wanted to take Lampião's weapons from him... and place a cross in his hands instead.
Have some respect, bastard priest!
Lampião struck, spit and kicked his face.
A man is a man when he uses his gun to change his fate.
Not a cross, Satan.
A dagger or a rifle!
Lies! Lies! Lies!
I always told you you had the wrong image of Sebastian.
Lampião was great but at times he was small.
That's a lie!
I'm afraid of dreaming of... all the lead I shot at good and bad men.
I am afraid of Hell!
I am afraid of the souls of the victims of my dagger.
I am afraid of being sad.
Of being alone like a cow lost in the desert.
I am afraid, Corisco.
I am afraid of the darkness of death.
It's true.
Dadá, go with the blindman and fetch our daughter.
Satan!
Go alone to see how many soldiers... are with
Antonio das Mortes.
They've killed our daughter.
They said she had to redeem our sins.
There's no way out.
The soldiers are blocking all the roads.
To Pernambuco, Alagoas,
Sergipe.
Antonio has all of us surrounded.
He said he'll send our heads to the President.
Sabiá! Macambira!
Go now.
You can keep the gold.
I'll face Antonio das Mortes alone.
Satan!
Are you going or staying?
It's always been against your will. Now decide.
I am too close to you now, to live.
If we get away... we're going to have a child.
Yes, a child!
I, José, shall be protected by Abraham's sword.
I, José, shall be annointed... with the milk of the Virgin Mary.
I, José, shall be baptized with the blood of Christ.
I, José, shall find shelter in Noah's Ark.
I, José, shall be locked by Saint Peter's keys.
Where no one will see me, won't hurt nor kill me.
Neither shall the blood of my body be taken from me.
Give yourself up,
Corisco!
Greater power to the people!

Long time no see, Captain.
Too, Dutch.
Thanks for coming, samurai.
Luis, good job.
Hello, old Dutchman!
And this why?
When I tell you to come, come.
I need you alive, not dead.
Okay, Dutch.
Although you have a very rare greeting.
Years have passed, but you do not have changed, Dutch.
Then you will not need to remind you he who gives orders here I am, and I'm willing to do anything to get it.
Is it clear?
There is something that is not what it looks in that old Mexican in there?
Is what we pay.
We work for him.
But is that how you will give us $ 1000 per head?
A peasant!
For your information, the farmer knows where gold is worth half a million dollars just waiting apoderemos we it.
A bank?
Not exactly.
A bank on wheels.
A train. A nice train with a rich cargo.
Well folks, now eat.
Well, now tell us what's that train laden with gold.
What matters, is a train!
It will be easy.
You may not opine you so when you know how that train.
I do not care.
For half a million dollars by me his back and I'll take it myself.
No, not that simple, Luis is right.
Is not a train either.
- Not be easy.
- What's so special?
I'm going to explain.
Toma.
First, the locomotive.
Immediately a closed van.
- I do not see the difficulty.
- Full of soldiers.
- Soldiers?
- After an open car with 2 machine guns.
And with more soldiers.
Nobody told me you had to faced with an army.
Next is our coach.
Fully shielded.
And within it, 8 armed men guarding jealously half a million dollars in gold.
- And finally, another open wagons.
- With more guns.
No friend, no, with a cannon.
You've gone mad, Dutch.
You need to wise men, not us.
No, you are exactly men need.
But, hey, how can we solve the canyon for example?
Vah, do not worry friend!
The Dutchman has it all planned.
Listen you do not stop to smile and say
Amen to everything, and still do not know who you are.
What does it matter who I am?
The important thing is what I am.
What are you?
Young, for example.
Enough to not be afraid!
What did you say?
Simply, freeze!
Let go, Mesito!
And you, Luis, keep your mouth shut!
None of these men will lie behind when the time comes.
Well, it's time to you may know each other.
As I am the only one who knows all,
I will make presentations.
Augustus, spent five years together in the army. Captain Benet and me.
The genius of dynamite, they called it.
He was able to fly anything and say a few pieces would be reduced.
During the War of Cuba, entrusted fly the mission of Fort Manareta.
It was a good job, blew up the fortifications, the arsenal, and to the safe
Cuban army.
And then he escaped.
The United States Army even goes looking for him.
Now Mesito. It was not for money so it got into difficulties.
But for food.
400 head of cattle to be exact.
Anyway, did not agree with the pay given to him as rail, and stole a train of meat ready for sale.
The trouble was that man who tried sell was the same owner.
You will not need to say that he was caught and jailed.
Two weeks later escaped.
And walk fugitive.
Caring for chickens.
I told you to shut up.
The samurai.
Exalted master in handling the sword.
And in the release of knife.
Fled the country the night with his sword
6 men was sliced ​​in 4 seconds.
In three seconds, sorry.
Does not talk much.
But when it acts, do not fuck around.
Once they interpreted jeans its silence as cowardice ... began to sneer at his slanted eyes.
And eight of them settled before that no one would notice.
What about the boy?
What can you do?
Louis. Luis Dominguez, of Trapecistas Dominguez.
Circus acrobats.
Mom and Dad Dominguez and his son Luis.
Only one night Dad fell from 3
0 m. without a net and that's the number.
Luis found himself without work, and found that robbing banks was which was more on account.
The trouble was that he threw down the gauntlet several times.
The first had it locked
6 months.
The second 6 weeks.
- And the third Louis?
- 6 minutes.
Yes, it sold off the two guards who carried him prisoner.
His portrait now walks all over the walls of Mexico.
Now, will you tell us what your plan to seize on that train?
No time for that, I will tell during the trip.
For how the trip?
Yes, the New World.
We start now.
Why leave all?
After the killing of soldiers
Do you want to stay?
Thank you. During the first stage trip, join us.
When we part, carry them with you.
If they had the height, better simulate that go with your family.
Why will you not, but when I take my hand that half a million ...
When I have my $ 1,000!
You know what I'm going to spend?
Let me guess.
Probably in a top hat, an elegant ruffled shirt, and one of those lace handkerchiefs who get into the sleeve.
You have not given one, Dutch.
I thought I knew your tastes.
Well, that proves you can never boast of getting to know a man.
Come on, no joke. You know that
I am not one of those smug.
I'll join with 200 head of cattle.
But honestly now!
- I can give you some advice?
- Of course.
Buy yourself something you can not eat.
What? Are you going YOU ARE nervous as old maids?
Do not start again, Luis.
How about out there?
If the guard duty of Augustus is as quiet as mine, will have to work hard to stay awake.
Anyway, not who hell could discover here.
We are alone with cacti and wind.
I do not trust, since General Huertas came to power, soldiers are lurking everywhere.
Have you heard? What do you think?
And speaks to me of soldiers!
He is not stupid enough to let captured by them three times.
Neither I was stupid enough to sell its owner ...
Just the two!
KEEP weapons for when the case!
He believed that there would need to shoot.
Did not you have a plan?
And I have it, but in any plan complications can occur.
Complications?
Do you begin to doubt the result perhaps?
I have not hesitated in my life.
And do not come if you had done was not sure my plan will succeed.
Dutch, you know me.
I'm a little slow when it comes to thinking.
And there is something that has me on tenterhooks.
Still have not said how is the work!
That half a million gold send it to
General Huertas some friends in Europe.
It's kind of contribution to protect their interests here.
If gold does not come to Mexico City, will to give many axplicaciones their masters.
What this pint in the old peasant
Morales Town?
The old farmer is Manuel Esteban, a of the leaders of the revolutionary forces.
Wants to take the gold to buy weapons and ammunition.
What we expected environmental apoderemos million to deliver it later?
You said it, buddy.
That expected.
Luis Dominguez.
Well, Dominguez.
I waited a long time now.
I'm Captain Gutierrez and have been caught in my jurisdiction.
I must warn you that as you were found in the company of rebels,
I suppose you are rebels,
You know what happens in these cases?
You shall be shot!
Except you, Dominguez.
You, you will be hanged slowly.
If you want to release for you, you have to tell me your names,
What were you doing with those rebels, what you came to Mexico, who called you, and who gave you hospitality.
That's it.
Be advised that I have tried with many stubborn and perhaps more stubborn than you.
All ma sooner or later have spoken.
Some after several days without sleep.
Other for leaving them without water.
And others having lost an eye.
When the Captain is in a good mood torture her mother.
Do not listen to your friend.
Is doomed.
While you can you stay alive.
Come on.
Speak!
What do you think, Captain?
Had not ever come with real men?
Take them away!
I will give some time for you to think how to save his skin.
Ehh, you!
Bring these men!
Tie them to the sticks!
No!
No!
Go! There is a romance between Japanese and the girl.
Forward!
Stop!
Left!
Attention!
Load!
Aim!
Fire!
In!
Sentinel!
Dominguez is dying.
Was it the blow to the head.
He's dying!
Back!
Back!
Mesito!
Take the gun.
And when the shooting starts, salt firing.
A thin sheet of steel.
Too beautiful
East for a vile.
The saber will keep to use as a gala when I make general.
Is not it good idea?
Of course if I get to find out what have come to do in Mexico these men, could ... show my gratitude setting free the eyes oblique, and his companions.
Ohh!
How much loyalty!
You do not want to reveal his secret even that this could cost you your life and yours.
Note that heroism is a man, girl!
It is much easier to persuade a woman to forget her ideals.
Much ...
Much easier
And much more enjoyable.
For pity's sake!
No!
Out of here!
Thank you.
Well, here we parted.
Return to your people.
I leave with a gun, you know how it handles.
And do not worry, soldiers will follow us.
Stephen!
We are friends of Manuel were!
Soldiers chase us!
We take care of it.
Maybe I'm wrong, but not can cope with all these soldiers.
I know, and they know it too.
But resist to give us time to flee.
It will cost them their lives!
Yes, kill them all.
We also know it.
And are willing to die for nothing?
They must be crazy!
There are men who die for money, others for a cause.
And they die for us.
Breathe for each one of us.
- Impossible!
- We shall see. Take a look down there.
What the hell is that?
The train of exploration.
Precedes the other in 20 minutes and check if there is damage on the tracks or explosive charges.
If you find any obstacle alerts immediately to our train.
Have you seen enough?
Dutch, are you sure you get it?
Never be sure until the work is finished.
For me over.
I retire.
That could not work out or a month time and we have only 4 days.
No, we only have three.
I do not like Dutch!
Why not?
You have a plan. It will be good, but not for that train.
Listen to me! My plan is on paper and result in practice!
Now the train is going for gold, within
3 days we take possession of half a million.
To give to the revolutionaries, of course.
The next time you see it, be ours.
Sorry gentlemen, this bandit tried to rob me.
But I managed to capture him.
Do you want to take him prisoner?
Dutch,
What about that house?
Is abandoned
As the station.
These rails seem in good condition.
Instead the ties are broken as crackers.
That does not think any more than food.
How much do you think can they hold?
The passage of a wagon once or twice.
Well, enough said.
Enough of shooter!
- To hit the target there is nothing like this.
- Nobody hears you shoot the pots.
But along the train route is platoons of soldiers every 6 miles ... willing to intervene the first shot.
And do not forget the soldiers going in the cars.
Keep working.
I ordered a Mesito
I did them.
I hope these will coviertas to reduce the noise.
Operate with dynamite like a cannon.
I have not given a full charge, but will give you an idea of ​​how it works.
It works great!
Keep worrying about noise.
Do not worry, you can cover your with the train whistle.
How about Captain?
Will he all right?
I'm too old to think, well you're the one who calls the shots.
But if you want my opinion,
I think they'll kill us all.
It's not like before, Dutch, when you and I were together there.
No more ... romantic adventures.
Reflect. Today we are only 4 old and a boy against at least 100 soldiers.
Against an armored train.
Against a cannon that can be turned off a candle to 5 km
5 men against guns and automatic rifles.
Before there were all those things.
We finished, and you know it.
Then why did you accept?
Because we are already dead long.
Our time has passed.
He left.
Look at me for example.
After leaving the army
I became a professional player.
He played very well before.
But when you've spent years manipulating dynamite feel inside ... as a vacuum.
It is what it is, but do not let live.
And suddenly, when you marcándote a bluff, hand ... you and trembles sweat like hell.
So I ended up plucking the poor devils.
And the others are no better. Mesito no longer knows what he is sleeping in a bed.
The samurai throwing knives in a shack fair for a dollar a day.
And Louis ...
Who is Louis?
A petty criminal like a hare.
And you yourself, Dutch. A man without a country the service of these ragged.
No, my case ... is different.
Different?
No, we are all equal!
So we have embarked in this case.
This time we cleared them all.
Everyone!
And you know it.
Samurai ...
Shoes, belts and what knives?
Very good.
Louis.
Shoes, belts, and handle.
And the clock?
Shoes, belts, fuses, covers, cable channels, what about the dynamite?
It appears that you have everything.
Except encouragement.
There, you will, Captain.
Mesito.
- Is this what it is?
- To let us all a drink.
Save it for when we something to celebrate.
Is the clock?
- Huh?
- Do you watch?
- Ah, I have.
- Let me see it.
- I have it!
- Show me!
Cuélgatelo neck, so you may not have sit on top of it.
Come on, put it on.
Instructions.
- Again!
- Yes, again and as many as fit.
20 minutes for open wagons.
3 minutes to move from car to car.
5 minutes for contingencies.
Total 34 minutes.
Mesito.
At 6:45 the train of exploration.
20 minutes after the convoy.
I have 20 minutes to attach the rails and changing needles.
All in 20 minutes.
They are more than enough.
Not when the last that fit one of life.
Places, everyone!
Come down!
Get in!
- There he is!
- Half a million dollars.
Now!
Attention!
Attention!
Attention!
Exit the train of discovery!
Raise the escort!
Guard to train!
Lord Mayor.
Lady.
- Have you come to see the train?
- Yes, Captain.
Kindly.
As you can see is well protected.
Heavily armed.
General Huerta has thought of everything.
Even men have been carefully chosen by their officers.
All guarantees absolute security.
- Do not you think, Mr. Mayor?
- Yes, of course, Captain.
This is the car of gold.
Apart from the armed escort traveling inside ... is externally protected by a sand-filled cushion.
Impressive.
Present arms!
Peter!
What will you do?
I do not want that gold
General Huerta arrives.
- Is it against Huerta?
- Right.
Then I help, I
I'm with the Revolution.
- What about your partner?
- He is with them.
Maybe tell me the truth, but might not.
Do not do stupid things.
Hey, look!
What is it, Captain?
Hurry!
I can not do.
Why not?
I dropped a cover.
And you can not do without it?
Sure! Want to hear the explosion up in Mexico City?
Or that stifle the noise with your hands?
Listen genius!
You will blow up loads!
I do not care how!
I do not care who loses a hand, or half-face!
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant, here is water!
Refrésquense!
Take!
Inside these guns or I'll shoot one on!
Throw them down!
And raise your hands!
Now?
No, not yet.
We will provide when we get to ... where we go.
Everyone knows the path to take.
So on!
Mesito!
Go into the truck!
Luis!
Tie them in that corner!
While the gold charge.
Come on!
Ah, come on!
Come on, give me a hand!
Mesito!
Are you okay?
Beautifully!
One for me,
One for the Dutch and Luis.
Augustus and the samurai.
One for me.
He is very busy.
One for Augustus and the samurai.
One for me.
One for the Dutch.
Louis.
Augustus and the samurai.
- Come on, cut the jokes!
- I'm not kidding.
Hebérmelo had figured.
Stand there, Mesito!
Louis reloads in the truck.
Have you imagined?
- Why not?
- Because I'm so stupid like you.
You can not take it all, Dutch!
All no!
No, not everything, my friend.
Here are the $ 1000 that you owe.
The rest comes with us.
With us, no.
Me.
Dutch ...
You said ...
We agreed.
We gold repartiríamos between you and me.
What you played well,
I never said that.
I listened to me, but your ambition, like everyone else.
I promised $ 1000 and there they are.
Yours too, Louis.
Dutch, has been a masterstroke.
You made us risk our skins.
You made him believe the boy who would you go halfway, and had perfectly planned the stay with it.
Not for me, Captain.
I told you it was for the revolutionary and to them will go.
A few years ago I was a hunted man in the United States.
So I came to Mexico.
I found good people who shook my hand.
And I met a girl.
For a time all went well.
Then one day, soldiers came, saying that his father and brothers were revolutionists, and that she was his accomplice.
I knew nothing about the Revolution and did not know the problems of farmers, so ...
I was released.
But they shot the other, even the girl.
It was my wife.
No Captain, gold is not for me.
It is for Manuel Esteban, for farmers, for the Revolution.
I did this for my wife.
Now you listen to me.
You can hide, go to another country, rename.
But wherever you are
I'll find you.
No matter how long it takes.
But I will find you.
I know you will, Captain.
I will leave the horses for a day from here.
Soldiers!
You two, come with me.
Are you with him?
No, I am with mine.
Dutch!
Did you succeed?
Ehh ..!
Yes, we succeeded!
Viva!
Thank you!

Hello, Two Crows.
Like hell we will.
Damn your eyes,
I spent all winter getting them furs.
And they're not for trade here.
What the hell do I want with him?
I don't care how you got him.
Wait a minute. I know he's brave as a buffalo. You don't have to slice him up.
I don't want him.
You're all right, Two Crows.
You ought to be a white man.
You'd be captain of the steamboat and president of the bank.
Just cos you own this damn country.
What are you standing there for?
Can't you speak English?
- No, sir.
- What do you mean, "No, sir"?
I mean I wish I didn't.
Come over here.
Turn around.
You sure don't look like you're worth a winter trapping of furs.
No, sir, I'm not.
In fact, sir, I'm not worth anything.
- What's your name?
- Joseph Winfield Lee.
Formerly of the Comanche tribe, until stolen by the Kiowas.
- You're far from home. You run away?
- As the spirits directed me, sir.
You don't talk like a field slave.
You kill anybody when you ran off?
No, sir. That's contrary to the law.
You think what those Indians did to me was the law?
- Just cos I'm trespassing?
- No, sir.
Caveat emptor legalis semper.
Let the buyer beware.
- I've heard that said.
- Where'd you learn them wise remarks?
I was privileged to associate with one of the best-educated families in Louisiana.
- I can read, write and cipher.
- Don't brag on it.
- Pick up that bag. Let's go.
- Where to?
To get my furs back.
Where the hell do you think?
Can I ask you a question, sir? How do you plan to fight all those Kiowas?
By natural application of superior tactics,
Massachusetts wit, and left-handed skill.
You're gonna shoot 'em, sir.
Hell, no.
There's a cask of trade rum in that pack.
Them Indians'll have a drunk party and I'll get back my packhorse and furs.
- What about me, sir?
- I'll sell you to the highest bidder.
Could you make that to a Comanche?
You seem to have a prejudice against serving the white race.
I don't mean to be narrow in my attitude.
Could I ask you what's your name, sir?
Joe Bass.
Well, Mr Bass, couldn't you kinda consider me a captured Comanche?
I came on foot as far as the Comanches.
It was my intention to circle south to Mexico.
The Mexicans have a law against slavery.
And since those Indians captured me from
Indians, I now have full Indian citizenship.
- Joseph Lee, you ever study the law?
- No, sir.
Neither did I. But you ain't got a chance in hell of calling yourself an Indian.
You're African.
Slave by employment, black by colour.
You ain't gonna walk good enough to catch them Kiowas.
I guess I'm a failure as a packhorse, sir.
A man don't ever say quit, Joseph Lee.
No, sir. He doesn't.
Hand me that bag.
Crab onto her tail.
See the superiority of the white-skinned race when it comes to walking.
My ancestors were famous as liars, walkers and patriots. Are you patriotic?
Yes, sir. Fourth of July
I generally set up quite a holler.
Of course, if someone came along now they might figure you own me.
- You're riding, I'm walking.
- But that's not the case.
In a manner of speaking, you are the image of my packhorse and fur pelts.
- I'd take good care of 'em, wouldn't I?
- Yes, sir.
They're a valuable wholesale or retail commodity.
You wouldn't be thinking of grabbing those reins and running off?
I doubt it, sir.
- You doubt it?
- I'm not sure of the directions.
I haven't any food and, as a Comanche,
I might run into those Kiowas again.
Tired?
You hear that? Two Crows and his boys are in that gully having a hell of a time.
You just sit here and rest for about five minutes while I take a look.
Pick 'em up.
- I've decided what I'm gonna do with you.
- Sell me to Egypt.
I'm gonna sell you in
St Louis. You'll retail for about 15 mules and 10 bales of cotton.
- Yes, sir.
- Don't try to run. You can't get nowhere.
- Yes, sir.
- And shut up.
Yes, sir.
Well, Mr Bass, there they are. Co get 'em.
Just like that?
I'd say they're considerably under the influence.
- You ever fight 12 drunk Indians?
- No, sir. But I'd like to see it done.
As a Comanche, what I'd do is run off their horses.
You're an African Comanche.
But you're right.
- You see that brush?
- Yes, sir.
- I want you to get down there.
- Right now, sir?
When it gets dark.
That's mesquite. It'll burn.
- I want you to start a fire.
- What'll you do, sir?
When they go for the fire,
I'll stampede their horses.
They'll be so drunk, I'll get my packhorse and furs and be gone.
- Can I say something, Mr Bass?
- What is it?
If you're gonna sell me back into being a runaway slave, do it all yourself.
Of course, if you help me get to Mexico, then maybe I'll help you.
Joseph Lee, I expect that someday you'll be president of the Bank of Omaha.
But right now you're going down there and do as I tell you.
Or I'll skin your black carcass.
Cet my rifle. Co on.
Over there!
All right, let's go!
Scalphunters.
Collect a $25 bounty on Indian scalps.
Men, women and children. Like jackals.
Territory government pays it.
Dirtiest, rottenest trade ever turned a dollar.
- Let's go.
- Where are we going, sir?
After 'em.
After 'em?
How the hell do you think I'm going to get my furs back if I don't go after 'em?
Mr Bass, I do not intend to put up with any more of this walking.
Now, either you slow down and talk to me, or I'll just have to pull you off that horse and knock you on your high-priced pants.
Are you deaf as well as dumb, Mr Bass?
Mr Bass, you're threatening my temper.
Mr Bass!
Mr Bass.
Sir, why are you so bound and determined to catch up with those murdering people?
Haven't you got anything else to do?
I just don't say something, then not do it.
I am completely and absolutely exhausted. Empty.
- I've got to have something to eat.
- You ate yesterday.
Mr Bass, I have been trained in the habit of eating each and every individual day.
That proves you ain't a Comanche.
Comanche would keep going till he died.
- I'm so hungry I could eat a frog or snake.
- Comanches do. Regular.
But I'm not a Comanche.
Oh, Mr Bass.
You see that?
Sego lily. Just like an onion.
Finest thing you ever saw.
You see this?
Sagebrush.
Crows where nothing else will.
You make Indian tea out of the leaves, and it makes a passable fodder for stock.
Look around you, Joseph Lee.
All natural creation.
Maguey. Makes a fine soap for washing down a squaw.
Brings the bloom of sunrise to her skin.
Watch this.
A needle and thread. For sewing things.
Here we are, Joseph Lee, in the Carden of Eden.
Just like Adam and Eve.
Chokecherries. They make a fine pudding.
You like pudding?
Joseph Lee, let's eat.
Co get 'em, Joseph Lee. I'm hungry.
I guess a slave like you got fed pretty good in that big house kitchen.
Sleeping in a bed every night.
Maybe you should have stayed where you was.
Vir libre quam in servitude.
"Better beans in freedom than cake in slavery."
Aesop. And he was a slave himself back in the Creek times.
Trouble with you is you read too many books.
You call it right when a man's a slave?
Owned, worked, beat all the time?
Natural state of affairs, Joseph Lee.
Black man started being a slave in the Bible.
If Cod didn't want it that way, Cod wouldn't have done it. Consult your Bible.
Cod didn't invent slavery.
The Egyptians did.
Sold all the children of Israel.
That ain't the way I read Scripture.
- What about Julius Caesar?
- Who?
Julius Caesar. He was an Italian. He made slaves out of all you Englishmen.
Julius Caesar made slaves of every kind of white man.
Put chains on 'em, dragged 'em back to Rome and fed 'em to the lions.
Africans like me, we didn't care that much for Julius Caesar.
Never heard of him.
That's cos you don't know how to read.
- I could bust you in the jaw.
- Wouldn't change anything.
And it wouldn't change you into a white man. Cet that through your head.
Let's see you write your name.
Let's see you feed yourself, Julius Caesar.
You wait here, Joseph Lee.
I'm going to take a look around.
Mr Bass!
Co down there and those people will just kill the literal hell outta you.
Now, don't you move.
Mr Bass.
Howie! How many times I gotta tell you?
Cet that sack of hair off my wagon.
Now, Kate, honey, them scalps is worth $25 apiece.
That don't mean we gotta sleep with 'em.
- That little old smell bother you?
- That ain't all that's bothering me.
Kate. Kate.
- Morning, Miss Kate.
- Morning, Mr Howie.
Shut up.
Co get some clothes on. I don't want these men getting horny notions.
Stop talking like a preacher.
If I had half the boots been under my bed,
I could outfit the US Cavalry.
- Hush and get back inside that wagon.
- I'm sick of that damn wagon.
Washing with no bathtub, getting rats in my hair.
- I'm living like a squaw.
- Kate, honey.
Look at my skin. It's all dried up.
Soon I'm gonna look like an old prune.
- I like prunes.
- Howie, I'm warning you.
If you don't find someplace I can live decent, you'll be sleeping with your horse.
Kate, honey. It's gonna be all right.
And stop chewing that damn tobacco!
You ever kiss anybody chewed tobacco?
Ain't she darling? Now you get those horses hitched and let's move!
Move!
Damn.
Now, Kate, honey.
Don't get your pretty little dooly-dooly all fussed up.
We was gonna have a fancy house.
With servants.
At last I was gonna live like a lady.
I should've stayed where I was.
You know, I knew a lady one time.
Chewed snuff. A redhead.
She'd stand on a piano and sing songs.
Damn.
Jim Howie, you got as much feelings as a bald-headed hog.
Oh, Kate, honey.
There's no cause to talk that way.
I'm gonna get you these things. I told you.
Centlemen. Am I glad to see you.
I have been chased and run over every rock pile for the past 50 miles.
I saw your wagons, and I knew right there my trials and tribulations were over.
- Anybody with you?
- Nobody, sir. Nobody at all.
- What's your name, son?
- Black Feather, sir.
I was adopted into the Wolf tribe of the Comanche nation.
The Kiowas set up a terrible slaughter on us three days ago. I escaped.
I'll just travel along with you gentlemen till I get back to my tribe.
- What'll he sell for, Jed?
- Oh, about 1,000.
1500 on the Calveston block, if he ain't lame or got belly worms.
Throw a rope on him.
- Let's move out!
- Hey! Hey!
Wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Stop! Wait!
I started out in life a prosperous, good-looking trapper.
And now, by Cod,
I ain't even got a slave no more.
Hey, hold on.
- Cet up there, boy. Come on.
- No, sir.
- I said get up there. Right now.
- No, sir.
What the hell's going on down here?
Camp meeting?
I'm not gonna be worth anything like this. Ruined on my feet.
- Drag him!
- Sir!
I'd be worth much more to you if you let me ride. Besides, I'm slowing you down.
- Holding you back.
- That's the first good sense I heard today.
You hush up and read your stargazing book and let me run my business.
Then why don't you run it like you knew what you was doing?
Look at that. Ain't she pretty?
All right, let him ride. Move it out!
Thank you, sir.
Not now, Julius Caesar.
Heading for church, sonny?
No, sir, Mr Howie.
I was just... making a botanical study, you might say.
You see that? Sagebrush.
Crows where nothing else will.
Make Indian tea from the leaves, and it makes a passable fodder for stock.
Look around you, Mr Howie.
All natural creation! Here we are in the
Carden of Eden. Just like Adam and Eve.
- Cet that water the hell back up there.
- Yes, sir, Mr Howie. Yes, sir.
- Beans, beans, beans. I'll look like beans.
- Nothing wrong with beans, honey.
I like beans.
What I wouldn't give for a decent meal.
On a white linen tablecloth, all fixed up nice.
I listen to you, Jim Howie, and I end up bouncing over every rock in creation.
My hair's all snarled up like a dish mop.
When we gonna start living in some kinda style?
When the hell we ever gonna get to Mexico?
Miss Kate.
You see that? Maguey.
Did you know that that makes a fine soap for a lady's care?
Brings the bloom of sunrise to her skin.
Used in the ancient times by the Queen of Sheba to restore the natural oils to her beautiful blonde hair.
- You mean that old common cactus?
- Yes, Miss Kate.
Botanical name Vir pluribus undulatum.
Known to the Comanches as maguey.
Really? You mean...
Yes, Miss Kate.
You sure this won't fade out my natural colour and turn it into somethin' horsey?
Oh, no, Miss Kate. On the contrary.
Did I hear you say you were going to Mexico?
Cot to. All the law in the country's looking for me and Jim Howie.
Oh, Mexico's a wonderful country,
Miss Kate. The haciendas and all that.
- You been to Mexico?
- No, ma'am.
But I speak the language. Buenos dias, buenas noches, muchas gracias.
Why, you'll be right in the most high-toned society, Miss Kate. A lady.
First thing I'm gonna get rid of this busted corset and buy me some fancy clothes.
You'll need quality trained servants. Takes proper service to put on the right style.
You mean like you?
I'd be honored to serve you, Miss Kate.
Jim Howie's dead set on selling you on the Calveston block.
No way around that.
Jim Howie don't always do everything he sets his mind to.
You have a very interesting texture to your hair.
Fine like gossamer. Like Helen of Troy.
Well, he fixed it pretty fancy?
I wonder what he's after.
Mighty fine, boy.
Sego lily, Mr Howie. Just like an onion.
Finest thing you ever saw.
- What the hell are you after?
- After, Mr Howie? After?
He just likes to serve quality folk.
Quality folk!
Coddamn.
I don't wanna hear that mushmouth, honey.
I got a rope burn on my neck where they tried to hang me one time in Sacramento.
And the first time I met you was in Ma Hogan's tent, remember?
And you weren't exactly sewing canvas.
- You hush your mouth now, Howie.
- Quality folk!
And I never worked no tent.
Dammit, can't you say
I'm pretty or somethin'?
You're the prettiest woman that ever wore garters and crossed her legs.
Howie, stop chewing that tobacco.
Come on, honey. Let's dance.
You look mighty elegant, Miss Kate.
Bailemos, compadre.
Come on, Joseph Lee. Fight him.
- Co on, boy. Let's see you fight.
- Punch him again.
Come on, boy.
You can fight him, boy.
Move in on him. Bust him one.
Come on, boy.
Look out, Yuma, he'll hurt you!
Come on, Julius Caesar. Fight him.
- Cet up, boy.
- Hit him again. Hit him!
The old daddy wolf does the cutting here.
You don't wanna damage our $1500 property.
You go soak your head, boy.
Cimme back my feathers.
Crab your partner!
Julius Caesar, you're a hell of a dancing man, but you sure can't fight.
See that guard over there by the horses?
Co over there and give him some of that fancy talk.
I'll sneak up and bust him one.
Then we'll load up my furs and get out.
The both of us.
Damn you, Lee, aren't you listening?
- I'm not sure if I am or not, Mr Bass.
- What?
I like you, Mr Bass.
You treated me decent.
And you're a religious man.
Know all about Ham, the black man in the Bible. Adam and Eve.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- These people are going to Mexico.
You mean... you mean you're going to stay with these heathens?
Well, you see, Mr Bass...
Mr Bass, you'd better consult Mr Howie.
He owns me now.
Why, damn your black hide, I traded...
Oh, Mr Bass. Well, then, you'll understand.
A slave has no choice of masters.
Just goes to the highest bidder.
Mr Howie's bidding Mexico.
Fine country, Mexico. I think I'll like it.
No slavery there.
I oughta kill you...
I'll show him.
That damned ungrateful black Comanche.
You stay here and be quiet.
And stop eating that tree.
Unless you're gonna double-cross me too.
Co get Yancy some food.
All right, I've got you.
Easy does it. There you go.
Whoa, boy.
Easy, boy. Easy.
Hey, Yan...
Hey, Yancy!
Howie!
Howie!
Come on, jughead.
This is no time to quit on me.
- All right, what was it?
- A renegade Apache.
Joe Bass, you socialise with these people, you're gonna get yourself scalped...
Miss Kate.
The night air's chill.
You need a wrap.

Anything funny?
Cet me some water, boy.
Yes, sir.
Don't reach for nothing, mister.
Walk up here, mister, or I'll kill you where you stand.
Easy.
I knew it. It's the law.
No, ma'am.
I mean, I hope not, Miss Kate.
That's close enough. Take your hat off.
Now reach up and scratch your ear.
"Scratch your...?"
You want to keep that ear, turn that packhorse loose and get on your way.
- Them beaver skins is mine.
- Yours?
I risked my life for them pelts.
I fought me a dozen Kiowas.
You slaughtered 'em, you scalphunting bastard.
Now, hold on.
That's no cause to dry-gulch a man.
Steal his furs. Wreck his water barrel.
You know, that ain't fair.
Cut loose that packhorse!
I ain't gonna kill you, but I ought to.
Now go on back there and keep moving.
Walk!
You crook!
Let's get outta here!
That bushwhacking half-breed.
We'll give him his furs back.
Dead. Let's move it out.
Frank!
Cet Yuma and flank that half-breed.
Hold it here.
Keep that first wagon moving.
Oh, Mr Bass. Those furs aren't worth it.
- What did you say, boy?
- Nothing, Mr Howie. Nothing.
Hey, bushwhacker.
Set your gun down.
- Howie, we gotta...
- Will you shut up, Kate?
Looking for me, scalphunter?
Lay that gun down.
Damn. Frank's got him!
There he is! Come on, get him.
Renegade Apache.
Renegade Apache, my ass!
Hey, Howie!
Jim!
Clear them rocks away.
Hey, mister!
Cut loose that packhorse and furs.
Move that wagon or I'll roll half this mountain down on you.
Hold on, friend.
You've got me.
Kate, get off that wagon.
- Howie, be careful.
- Now, you, Kate, hush up.
All right, move that wagon on down.
All right. Hold on, we're going.
OK, boy. Cimme a hand.
Mount your horses.
Cet in that wagon. Cit.
- Virgo's passed Jupiter in the third phase.
- What?
Sagittarius and Cassiopeia are in the ascendancy.
That's right. How'd you know that?
Miss Kate, when is Mr Howie's birthday?
He's a Leo. July 27th.
July 27th. I was afraid of that.
You sure Virgo is passing Jupiter?
Mr Howie is a strong, powerful man.
A Leo. A natural leader, right?
Did you know that Napoleon Bonaparte was a Leo too, Miss Kate?
The same birthday as Mr Howie.
And when he met Waterloo...
Destroyed. Virgo had passed Jupiter in the third phase.
That's gonna happen now.
Did you really study all about reading the stars?
Well, as far back as the Egyptian Pharaohs.
And the Hebrew prophets. Down through
Persia, Babylon and Mesopotamia.
Shalom, abi gezunt, aleph, beth, gimel.
Tell me, how's it gonna be for Virgo?
I'm a Virgo.
Pythagoras.
I see a cloud. A threatening cloud.
Travelling. Travelling.
- Miss Kate, I hate to tell you this...
- Tell me, tell me.
Something evil following us.
Has been following us for days.
Something covered with... hair.
The Indian scalps.
That packhorse with those damn fur pelts.
Right! An evil combination.
The spirit of the dead Kiowas... and the zodiac configuration of the stars.
What do you mean?
Look.
Jupiter moving in on Pluto.
Disaster. Death. A man killed.
- Mr Howie.
- Jim?
Listen, I've read the stars.
I didn't see all that happening.
- But where did you look?
- Right here. Page...
Oh, Miss Kate!
I mean here. Pisces, Libra, Capricorn.
And here. Those furs... and that man out there... are the Scorpio satanic configuration of death for Jim Howie.
And the stars never lie.
But Howie don't believe in all...
He don't believe in anything.
But we do.
And we know it's true.
Don't we?
Then it's up to us.
You.
Me? How?
Cut loose that packhorse.
Cet rid of those evil furs.
Tonight.
I'll do it.
Damn, that's good and vile.
You think I'm going to give up on those people, don't you?
Well, I ain't.
You got any ideas about what we ought to do next?
Hell, you never have no ideas about nothing.
Hey, get outta there!
You damn jughead. That's locoweed.
You'll run around like a coyote with his guts hanging out. Let's see your mouth.
Open it up. Come on. Open it up.
If you ate any of that stuff, we're both done for.
You'll be crazy in the head and I'll be walking.
How do you feel?
Well, I might as well find out.
If you throw me
I'll know you had a bellyful.
Now. Easy.
Well, I guess you're all right.
Now, will you bend down and pick up my rifle? I'm tired.
By Cod, you have got an idea.
Cet those other horses in here.
- Bring 'em up!
- Cet 'em all in.
What the...?
¿Qué pasa con estos caballos?
Howie! Howie!
What the hell is wrong with them horses?
Cet 'em out of the water!
Don't look at me like that.
It was your idea.
Dirty rotten Comanche trick!
- You gonna keep those skins?
- If I have to pack 'em on your back.
You're gonna have us crawling on our bellies.
You don't shut up, I'm gonna kick your backside right up to your shoulder blades.
Can I say something, Mr Howie?
Wouldn't it make more sense just to give the man his furs back?
Well, I'll be damned.
Now I've heard everything.
What in hell is this world coming to?
If you give that man his furs back, he'll let you alone.
I know him, Mr Howie.
- You what?
- What?
I was with the Indians when they took his furs from him.
All he wants is what's his.
Well, well, well, well.
I'm a curly-haired, blue-eyed angel.
- And you're in with him.
- No, sir.
But I know him, Mr Howie. Let me go talk to him. Maybe he'll listen to me.
Howie, listen to him.
Just how long you think you're gonna stay alive? Look at your men.
Well?
Is that the way you want it?
Jed?
Well, Yancy?
I just want to get to Mexico. Alive.
It makes sense.
Four men we rode with... dead.
Loco'd our horses.
And you want me to give him the furs?
I don't care!
Hell, give him everything! Co ahead.
And I hope he blows your head off.
Hey! You want to give him my whiskey, too?
Catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, Mr Howie.
Jim Howie's boys... are gonna quit.
Split the guts of five
United States marshals.
Took half the banks of Kansas.
Took a whole town full of Chink miners.
And jumped more Indians than the United States Cavalry.
And Jim Howie's boys are gonna quit.
For one man.
For one man.
Mr Bass!
Mr Bass, where are you?
Mr Bass. Speak to me.
Damn you, Joe Bass.
I wonder why I go to all this trouble.
Cetting myself abused by that bloodthirsty Jim Howie.
And all for you and your measly furs, you ill-mannered, unlettered oaf.
Mr Bass, speak up!
I know you're out there, sneaking around.
Who do you think you are? Daniel Boone?
What's the matter, Julius Caesar?
Cet lost again?
Mr Bass, please. You ruin a man's mortal insides when you do that.
What are you here for?
To help them people kill me?
They don't want to kill you any more.
They want you to stop killing them.
They'll leave your furs and go.
You lying, split-tongue African Comanche.
You think I'd trust anything you say?
I'd take the word of that scalphunter before I'd believe you.
I'm telling the truth.
They've had enough.
Don't you lie to me no more.
I'll get my furs.
And you and them people will be for the vultures.
What you got there?
What you got there?
Cood drinking whiskey.
Mr Howie's own stock.
Thought you could maybe use a drink about now.
You sure made your way with those people. You got their whiskey.
You're doing their bushwhacking for 'em.
Sashaying along with that fancy woman.
Throw you in the pigpen and you'd come out vice president of the hogs.
If Cod ever made better inventions than a pretty woman or a bottle of whiskey,
I ain't heard of it.
Mr Bass.
Could I have a drink of that?
If I was to give you a drink of this whiskey, it'd be like pouring it out on the sand.
Whiskey's a man's drink. And you ain't no man. You ain't no part of a man.
You're a mealy-mouthed, shufflebutt slave and you've picked a master.
So don't go asking to take a drink with a man.
You think mighty well of yourself, don't you, Joe Bass?
You know how long you would last as a colored man?
About one minute.
The trouble with all your fighting, Joe
Bass, is you don't know when you've won.
Co ahead. Kill us all.
Lee.
Tell 'em to move out and leave my furs.
Joseph Lee.
Come back here.
Tell 'em from here.
Mr Howie!
Move out.
That's everybody.
Don't seem right, that man doing an honest thing.
They just want to be rid of you.
Where are you going, Julius Caesar?
With them. Where I aim to.
- To Mexico.
- Wait a minute.
Walk on down there ahead of me.
Hold it there.
Tie her up.
Co on. Scat.
This one won't scalp any more Indians.
Look out!
I busted his skull! I've done it!
The old daddy wolf, he done it. He done it.
Mr Howie.
OK.
- No.
- You killed my men, and loco'd my horses.
And now... I gotta punish you.
I'm gonna take your hair, and peel your pretty white hide one inch at a time.
Quit talking, you ugly bastard, and do it.
I'm going to hear you cry, and I'm going to hear you beg.
- No, Mr Howie.
- Cet off of me.
- You don't have to kill him, Mr Howie.
- Boy, I'm gonna kill you too.
Now, my boy, you... you put that knife down.
Cut him, Lee. Cut him!
Now, you listen to me.
Now, listen to me, my boy.
I won't lift his hair.
I won't sell you.
And I'll let you go on with me.
To Mexico.
- Now, drop that knife, boy.
- Don't listen to him.
You really don't want to kill a man.
Do you?
I mean, do you?
Now you're using your head, boy.
Lee!
Cet it, Lee!
Yowee!
Joseph Lee, you did it!
By Cod and by thunder, you did it!
I couldn't be more proud if you was my own grandpa.
Joseph Lee, you sure deserve that drink.
Now untie me.
He's sure taking his own sweet time.
- You worrying about Jim Howie?
- Stick him, he bleeds like anybody else.
That may be true, only he's the one gonna be doing all the sticking.
- Why isn't he back here by now?
- You think he'd aim at a man, then miss?
One man, no.
But there are two back there.
Joe Bass, you're looking at a rich man.
I might just hire you and your horse to take me to Mexico.
Isn't there anything you want to say to me?
Like "Thank you, Mr Lee"?
- Co to hell.
- Don't you mean "Co to hell, Mr Lee"?
Oh, quit acting like a damn fool.
First time you had guts enough to fight, you puff around like a pregnant squaw.
Now untie me.
What the hell are you doing, Lee?
Damn you, Lee, that's my horse.
Cet off him.
Damn your hide, Lee. What are you up to?
Sic transit gloria mundi.
"To the victor belong the spoils."
Now, wait a minute, Joseph Lee.
Now, just a minute.
Let's you and I palaver.
We've had some differences, but you wouldn't leave a man alone in the desert.
All tied up, with the crawling snakes.
And the bloodthirsty buzzards.
And the hungry coyotes.
You wouldn't do that.
Leave me to die, all alone. Would you?
You're Joe Bass. You can move mountains. You'll be all right.
Cet off my horse, you son of a bitch!
You know something, Joe Bass?
You are the most stubborn, love-yourself man that ever walked Cod's creation.
And somebody just naturally ought to bust some sense into your hard-boned head.
Somebody ought to just naturally bust some sense into my hard-boned head?
You wanna try?
Hey, you jughead! Come back here.
Yeah. I wanna try.
All right, Joseph Lee. Cet 'em up.
Protect yourself. Cet your hands higher.
Indian fighting. Like it?
Let me help you.
Can't see, can you?
That ain't fair!
I'm gonna bust you on the jaw for that.
"See the superiority of the white-skinned race."
"You're a mealy-mouthed, shufflebutt slave."
Damn you, Jim Howie. What the hell was so important about a bunch of lousy furs?
Kate.
Over there.
Time.
Wait a minute. I hear something.
Wait a minute. I really do hear something.
What the hell. They're only men.
Indian man.
I don't know how many wives you got now, but you're gonna have the damnedest white squaw in the Kiowa nation.
You black Comanche!
Where are you?
Two Crows! Ain't you dead?
I'm sure glad to see you, Two Crows.
Hey, wait a minute. Them's my furs.
Cood hunting, Joe Bass.
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute. Wait. Hold it.
You dirty redskins!
You know something?
There's two cases of whiskey on that wagon.
I'd say by tonight there's going to be a lot of drunk Indians.
For years following the Civil War the question was whether Indians or the United States Army would control Arizona Territory.
Bands of hostile Apaches roamed the countryside.
Only the courage and dedication of a few brave fighting men kept the Territory from being completely overrun.
In the summer of 1869,
Cochise, bold chief of the Chiricahua Apaches, made a brutal vow to kill every man, woman and child in southern Arizona.
Many of the settlers in the area had already felt the fury of Cochise's bloody oath.
A small detail of
United States cav alrymen were escorting the survivors to a hastily-established outpost.
There, the Army was determined to make a last-ditch stand.
I know how to spell our name.
Go work.
Hey! Hey, look!
It's Bruce.
Don't get your hopes up, sis, when the Captain comes courting he doesn't bring a crowd of people.
Ellen.
- It's good to see you, Bruce.
Is something wrong?
Your pa at the house?
- Yeah.
Let's go talk to him.
Isn't that the Carter family?
What's left of them.
Apaches hit this morning.
Your place will be next.
Sure glad you came to stand them off, Captain.
We make our stand at Apache Wells.
Oh, you're going to have a hard time talking Pa into leaving.
They all wanted to stay, too.
The Apaches made a pretty good argument against it.
Sergeant Walker.
Have some of the men find their wagon.
Pitch it up and bring it to the house.
Captain, wait. Don't you think you ought to talk to Pa first?
I think he'll understand.
Pa!
Captain Coburn.
Mrs Malone.
Cochise's gone on the war path.
- What?
We're escorting the settlers into Apache Wells.
I didn't ask for any escorting.
Neither did they, Cochise sent his braves to burn them out.
Pa knows how to deal with the Apaches.
There's no dealing with them, Mike.
How many guns do you have?
Just this one.
She's never failed me yet.
Look, Mr Malone.
Our job is to protect you people.
We can't put soldiers at every farm house.
You've got to come in where our strength is concentrated.
You better listen to him, Harry.
Kate.
We have given ten long years of hard work to build up this place.
And you'll give your life if you try to hang onto it.
Cochise made a vow he'd kill every white man in southern Arizona.
Looks like he's already started.
Now this is no time to argue.
I'm not going to let you stay here and get killed.
Well, I guess it's the only way.
It'll take me a little while to pack.
Sorry, ma'am, we can't wait.
Troopers will bring your wagon around.
Be ready to go when it gets here.
Come on, Ma.
Pick up what you can, kids.
Captain, shall I order the men to dismount?
Sergeant Walker gives the orders.
I know that, sir, but the men asked me to talk to you.
They're complaining you're driving them too hard. They need a rest.
They can rest when we get back to camp.
I know, Captain, but we got to stop somewhere.
There's water, hay for the horses.
We can stand off the Apaches here as good as any other place.
Bodine, are you talking command of this outfit?
No, sir.
When I was a sergeant the officers used to listen to what I had to say.
Is that why they broke you to Corporal?
They'll need me again, sir.
Maybe they will, but by God I don't.
If you give me one more bit of trouble
I'll bust you all the way back to Privey.
Now, mount up.
Yes, sir.
Locking horns with the Captain again, Bodine?
I don't back off for nobody,
Sergeant.
Well, that's why you're here.
You and a dozen more like it that nobody else could handle.
Sergeant, I want to tell you something.
He might break the rest of them but he won't even make a dent in me.
Sergeant Walker?
- Hello.
Put a match to it, no use leaving anything for Cochise.
Whoa!
Captain Coburn drove the settlers hard all day, but nightfall and weariness finally forced a halt.
I want your complete cooperation tonight.
If we're attacked they'll probably hit the wagons and the horses first.
I want you people to bed down right up there in those rocks.
There'll be no fires, no noise.
Be ready to move out at daylight.
We don't have much water, sir.
- I know.
Give the women and children what they need, save the rest for the horses.
Get them started, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
All right. Bring your belongings and come with me.
Look, Captain, what about us troopers?
We're just as thirsty as they are.
We've been riding in the hot sun all day.
It won't hurt you to go one night without water.
Look, Capt...
- That's all, Bodine.
You know, we'd better get ready to help if there's Indian trouble.
Let's ask the Captain if he'll lend us a couple of rifles.
You know how I am with guns, Mike.
Can't hit the broad side of a barn!
Well, if those Apaches get close, you'll learn fast enough.
Any chance those Apaches will hit tonight, Captain?
They don't let me in on their plans always, Mike.
Just try to keep ready.
Doug and I would like to help if you'd let us have a couple rifles.
I appreciate the offer but I don't have enough guns to arm my own men.
Well, then I guess we'll have to sharpen up the old axe, huh?
Many a battle has been won with less.
Hey, Mike, Doug?
Come on, give me help.
Here. Ma and Pa went up the hill, you can take them up, huh?
All right.
Oh!
It's been a long time since we've been able to talk to each other.
Over a month, Colonel hasn't been too generous with leave time lately.
Oh, well you won't have any more excuses.
I'll be right there at Apache Wells.
I won't be looking for excuses.
Come on, I'll walk you.
Mm, uh-uh. I like it right here.
Listen to that lonely sound.
Probably a lonely Apache scout.
Did you come out here just to protect me from the Indians?
Well, not exactly but...
They'd give anything for a scalp as pretty as that one.
How about you? Hmm?
It'd be awful easy to hand it to you.
Why don't you?
I'm not a very good bet for a girl like you.
Men in my business don't stick around too long.
Your warning comes a bit late, Bruce.
I'm going up the hill, see you later.
You know that's all the water we have.
You'd never do that if you weren't hiding behind those Captain's bars.
I'm not hiding behind anything,
Bodine.
I fought in this army for ten years before they pinned these on me.
I don't need them now.
Oh?
You mean you're willing to forget you're an officer and reckon man to man?
I've tried everything else with you.
I guess that's the only language you understand.
Captain! Captain!
Captain, you'll kill him, sir.
Pick those horses up and put a guard on the water.
Yes, sir.
Apache Wells, Arizona territory.
Colonel Homer Reed in command of a troop of cavalry whose assignment was to hold the lonely outpost at any cost and to protect the settlers in the adjacent area.
Nearby families had already taken refuge here, only the most distant ranches remained to be accounted for.
Attention! At ease.
That Captain Coburn's outfit?
- No sir, that's the morning patrol.
Captain was due back yesterday, wasn't he, sir?
I'll send a detail if they don't return by nightfall.
The old man is lost if Coburn isn't around.
It'd suit me if that stiff-necked
Captain never came back.
Bugler! Sound assembly.
Take care of your wounded.
The rest of you, hold your posts.
They might come back.
Good work, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.
Captain and me have ridden together for a long time.
Can't lose him this close to home.
These Apaches are getting bolder.
I thought they'd follow you into camp.
Maybe next time they will.
I'm getting sick and tired of having to turn and run every time an Apache sticks his head up.
When are we getting those new rifles, Colonel?
I've put in requests at least a dozen times.
Army keeps sending back excuses instead of rifles.
They give us an impossible job and no tools to do it with.
How long do you think we could hold this place against an all-out attack?
Not long with our old worn-out guns.
You think Cochise would risk all his forces on a frontal assault?
He's smart, Colonel.
When our patrols can't stand and fight it shows weakness.
He won't be long in taking adv antage of it.
At least you got the settlers here where our power is concentrated.
Show them where to set up camp, will you?
Yes, sir.
Bodine.
Why didn't you pick him up?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Stand up when I'm talking to you!
You heard me call.
With all that shooting?
I didn't hear nothing.
That beating the Captain gave you didn't teach you much, did it?
Oh, I haven't forgotten anything about that, Sergeant.
He did a pretty good job on ya.
- Yeah.
You...
Anybody else want to take a look, huh?
Anybody else want to take a look?
Look! Come on, look!
Anybody else down here?
Come on, look at it!
Don't think that this gives
Captain Coburn the whip hand.
Oh I'm going to be a good soldier from now on.
Every time the Captain rides out of this camp I'll be right behind him.
He catches a bullet I want to make sure he's dead.
Malone's old rifle had finally failed him.
Ironically, an Apache bullet had caught him just as safety seemed assured.
He's dead!
I thought we'd made it but...
He was laying dead on that seat when we got in.
If we joined the Army...
...could we get some rifles, Captain?
I'd see that you get guns some way.
Good 'cause we're ready to fight!
Stand at... ease.
Colonel Reed had fired off an angry demand to his home base.
After two weeks of anxious waiting, a reply finally came.
All right, what is it?
A shipment of new lever-action rifles came in from back east.
They're sending you 40 of them.
- When do we get them?
You'll have to meet them beyond the Chiricahua mountains.
They hired some scouts to bring them that far.
Figured you fellas were the best to sneak them past Cochise.
They sure give us the tough end of it.
It's up to you, Bruce.
We'll get them through.
- Going to have your hands full.
Those mountains are crawling with Apache.
Three different bunches of them gave me a run.
I had to come around here through the Apache pass to get by them.
May as well back the same way.
Keep your eyes open.
The guns will be here at
Hatchet Rock tomorrow, noon.
Hatchet Rock.
Might as well keep it, Captain.
Might come in handy.
Thank you.
You've done a good job, the rest is up to us now.
Better get some rest.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, Bruce the Army finally came through, 40 repeating rifles.
That will improve our chances against Cochise.
Improve them? Trade our old singleshots for those lever actions, we can hold off all the Apache in this territory.
We're going to have to bring them in first.
I'll get some men together now, sir.
Take as many men as you need,
I don't want to be left shorthanded but take enough troopers to get the job done.
We'll sneak out of here after dark,
Apache won't even know we're gone.
Oh, Captain.
- Yes, sir?
That last mission you were on...
...there is a rumour that you beat up one of the men.
Colonel, you know how rumours get started on a small post like this.
This is a serious matter, Captain.
I'll overlook it this time, but from now on try...
Baby them a little more?
Captain, there are two ways to get men through a door, you can kick them through or you can lead them through.
That's right, sir, but they wind up the same place anyway.
Take a look out there, Colonel.
It's not exactly the cream of the crop, yet we're expected to make soldiers out of all of them.
I know it's a ragtag bunch they sent us to fight Indians, but this mission is vital, Bruce.
We can't afford any trouble in the ranks.
I don't expect any trouble, sir.
Sir...
With the Captain's permission,
I'd like to go along on this one.
You sure got a sixth sense for something big, haven't you, Sergeant?
Well sir, I been around long enough to get these stripes here,
I'm bound to know if something's going on.
I see.
It's the rifles, isn't it, sir?
Yes, it is. Let's just keep it between the two of us.
The less the men know, the less the Apache can get out of them in case they get captured.
Attention.
I need ten men for a mission, a very important one...
...and it's very dangerous.
I'm asking for volunteers.
Come on, Doug!
What's the matter with you, Fuller?
What about you, Higgins?
Thank you, men. We'll leave tonight.
Check your equipment, take care of your horses.
Dismissed.
Captain?
- What is it, Sergeant?
You said this was an important mission but...
It is.
You sure haven't got the best men riding with us.
Those two green Malone boys, it's their first time out.
Bodine, he's always trouble.
He'll do, Sergeant.
Have them ready after chow.
- Yes, sir.
They're proud to be riding with you, Bruce.
Glad to have them.
They'll make good soldiers.
Watch out for both of them, especially Doug.
Mike can take care of himself but Doug...
...he'll need help at first.
I'll keep an eye on him.
I guess it's because I'm older that they seem like such boys to me.
They'll be men when we come back.
They're waiting for us, Doug we've got to go.
Goodbye, Mama.
Boy, take care of Doug, huh?
Goodbye, sis.
- Bye.
Goodbye, sis.
- Take care.
Everybody is counting on you, Bruce.
You've got to get those rifles through.
We'll do our best, sir.
Under the cover of darkness,
Captain Coburn moved out with his little band of volunteers.
Everything depended on his success in reaching the rendezvous with the supply wagon and the 40 rifles.
Coburn led his men deep into the Chiricahua mountains.
When they reached Apache Pass the Captain sensed that hostile eyes were watching from the high rocks.
Have a look now, sir.
Apache can hide in a badger hole.
Hold up a couple of minutes,
I want to take a look.
Yes, sir.
Apaches wouldn't take on this many soldiers would they, Mike?
You're not scared, are you?
A little, aren't you?
Of course not.
That's what we joined up for, to get a crack at them.
I think I can shoot once but
I wonder if I'll be able to reload with a bunch of Indians hollering down on me.
You'll do fine.
Just remember we'll be fighting them side by side.
Hooo!
All right, two men dismount and take cover.
He signalled to someone up there before I got him.
That means they know we're coming.
You look a little pale, boys.
I thought you wanted to see 'em butchered.
Leave those two kids with the horses.
Assign a rearguard and the rest of you come with me.
Yes, sir.
Malone brothers, stay with the horses.
Yes, sir.
Bodine.
- Yes, Sergeant?
You, you post the rearguard and cover.
The rest of you come with me.
Doug!
Look, I saw one.
- What?
I saw one up there!
Let's go get him.
But, the Sergeant told us to stay here.
But, he didn't tell us not to fight.
I'll circle around this way, you come up the back of him.
Mike?
Come on now, you've got to get your feet wet sometime.
This is as good a place as any.
I'm scared, Mike. I'm scared.
I never should have joined the Army.
Look, I know how you feel, everybody's nervous at first.
You'll get over it once you get into the action.
Well, come on!
Let's go get us an Apache.
Mike. Mike!
Doug! Come on, Doug.
I'm coming, Mike.
Doug, help me! Doug!
Doug, come on help me.
Mike!
Mike!
Where's Mike?
I tell you where he is, the Apaches carried him away.
This kid didn't have the guts to help his brother.
I can't believe that, Doug.
It's true.
He just kept calling me.
I couldn't make myself go to him.
I can still hear him.
I can still hear him calling for help.
Fetch the horses.
On your feet.
Mike!
Mike!
Mike, Mike!
Please, please let me go!
I've got to help him.
Mike, please!
- Take it easy, kid.
Let me go. Let me go!
Shut up!
- Mike, Mike!
Mike! Mike!
- Doug. Listen, Doug.
Now you listen to me.
Its too late to help your brother.
He's dead, you understand?
He's dead.
Get him on a horse.
The troopers were on the run.
The Captain couldn't afford to lose one more man.
If those 40 repeating rifles didn't get back to Apache Wells,
Cochise would massacre every one of its defenders.
As far as we go, Sergeant.
We going to be here long, Captain?
I don't think so, why?
I've a feeling we're being watched.
You could be right.
Dismount.
Keep your rifles handy.
We going to go back the same way we came, sir?
I don't think it makes any difference how we go back, Sergeant.
If we get hit again we'll just have to make a run for it.
We left half our men lying dead back there.
Yes, sir.
Some of the best ones, too.
There's only seven of us left to get them guns through.
Six.
Six men and a worthless, yellow kid.
Don't be too hard on him, Captain.
Remember that was his first time under fire.
That's no excuse. I've got no use for a coward, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Bodine.
- Hmm?
When we going to get out of here?
- Shh! When I say so.
Come on, we got a couple of pretty good horses.
What are we waiting for?
I've still got something to settle with that Captain.
Get it settled, I don't intend to ride back to that death trap.
I promise you one thing, we'll never go back with this outfit.
Hold your fire.
Glad you're here, Captain.
I didn't aim to wait long.
Kind of jumpy, aren't you?
- There's good reason.
We come within a ace of tangling with a herd of Apache about an hour ago.
Chiricahuas?
No, them's Tontos.
Them's wearing war paint.
Seem to knows where they's going.
To join Cochise.
That's my guess.
We're shorthanded, be glad to have you ride with us.
Not on your life.
My contract called for me to bring this wagon here and no further.
I value my head too much to travel into Chiricahua country with old Cochise on the war path like he is.
You got a point there.
Army doesn't give us any such choice.
That's your problem, Captain.
Mind if we take off now?
All right gather around, men.
This is what we came for.
40 repeating rifles.
No other gun of its kind in southern Arizona.
Oh-wee!
With these the Indians could wipe out every white man in this territory.
I've got to get them through to
Apache Wells and we will, else there will be seven more dead troopers lying in these hills.
Now, if we are overrun...
...the last man alive will light this fuse...
...and stay with this wagon until it's blown to hell.
Are there any questions?
Good.
Sergeant, want me to take the team?
Sure. Go ahead, Bodine.
Hey! I thought you said we weren't going to go back with this outfit.
You just relax, Barrett, just relax.
There's been a change of plans.
I didn't tell you to stop, Bodine.
Captain, it's a long pull up that hill, the horses are winded.
All right, dismount.
We'll rest here for a minute.
Good shot, Barrett.
Come on, tie him up.
The rest of you keep those rifles pointing in the air.
Now, me and Barrett are taking off with these rifles.
Don't worry, we're not hogs, these guns are worth plenty.
We might need some help.
The Captain didn't offer you anything when he asked you to volunteer.
Go along with me,
I'll make you rich.
You do that and you'll sign the death warrant of everybody at Apache Wells.
Don't worry about that, these guns will make us king of the mountain.
Higgins, what about you?
I know you like money.
Come on, you'll never have a chance like this with that uniform.
Eight dollars a month don't pile up very fast.
I knew you'd see it my way.
Well, Fuller?
Oh, that's right.
You'd rather have the Captain chew your tail out every day, or are you waiting for the Apaches to come along and finish the job?
You'll be running the rest of your life, Fuller.
You'll have to hide your face everywhere you go.
How long do you think he's been called Fuller?
That's right, I changed my name to get into the Army.
I sure don't mind changing it to get out.
Right, and when we get to where we're going, which is Mexico, soon as we cross that border you can call yourself lucky when those senoritas start swarming all over you.
Kid, how about making it unanimous?
Oh, come on now!
You sure you don't want to face your folks right after letting your brother get killed?
What about them?
We can't just leave them here to die.
Ah, don't worry about it.
We'll let them loose before we leave.
They'll make their way back all right.
Come on, kid!
You coming with us or not?
All right.
As long as you're letting them go.
Pack those rifles on the team, we're heading across country.
I'd offer to take you with us,
Sergeant, but you might slow us down.
Damn you, Bodine.
Well, Captain...
You've been top dog for a long time.
You know there's an old saying,
"Every dog has his day".
And I'm doing the barking now.
I thought that uniform would do something for any man that wore it, even you, Bodine.
Well, it did something for me.
It got me what I've been waiting for.
Chance to turn traitor?
Well, I guess it's all in the way you look at it.
See, the uniform I started out in was grey.
When I was captured at Shiloh they gave me a choice...
...to rot in a stinking
Yankee prison camp...
...or join you Blue Coats fighting Indians.
You see, Captain Sir,
I'm sort of a galvanised Yankee.
I don't have too much respect for this blue outfit.
I don't imagine you had too much loyalty for the grey one, either.
I want to tell you something,
Captain.
Changing uniforms has taught me one lesson.
A man only owes one loyalty...
...to himself.
Come on, Bodine. We're ready to go.
All right head on out,
I'll be with you in a minute.
Higgins, pick up that loose stuff.
- All right.
This is your idea, Captain.
You ordered the last man to stay with the wagon...
...till it was blown to hell.
Well, you're the last man.
See you in hell, Captain Sir.
Sergeant!
Sergeant, can you hear me?
Yes, sir...
I can hear you.
I can see, too.
Listen, I, my rope is tied to the wagon but I don't think yours is.
Can you roll away from here?
I'm sorry, sir. I, I can't make it.
It's a long way to Apache Wells,
Sergeant, think you can make it?
I sure don't want to stay here, sir.
You're going to have to rest.
Now, don't you go passing out on me.
I won't pass out on you, Captain.
Just keep talking to me.
I don't know why you don't go ahead and leave me here anyway I'm...
I'm slowing you down.
I know how determined you are to get those guns.
Now, you listen to me, we'll make it back together or we won't make it at all.
You got more guts than any man I ever knew.
Must have been bred in you.
Not exactly.
Actually, I come from a long line of losers, Sergeant.
Matter of fact my family motto was,
"If at first you don't succeed...
"...give up".
You sure switched that around somewhere.
I tried to.
When I was nine years old,
I'll never forget that, big, old kid knocked me down.
I just lay there and thought it'd be safer, till he kicked me.
Well, something must've popped inside of me because I got up and fought back for the first time in my life and I liked it.
Did you whip him?
No.
No, he beat the tar out of me.
But, I learnt something though.
We're all going to die someday.
It's better to die fighting than lying with your face in the dirt.
That sort of spirit sure made a hell of a soldier out of you.
Yeah, I knew I wanted the Army when I was 15.
Ran away from home to join up.
Clawed and scratched through the ranks till I was a top cat like you.
Of course, with my background if it hadn't been for the war,
I'd never have made Officer.
I won these bars fighting in the field.
There's going to be a star there someday, Captain.
There won't be anything there if I don't get those rifles back.
Yes, sir.
Come on.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Looks like I'm going to have to carry you.
Now, look dead, will you?
You couldn't have found a better decoy!
Here he comes.
Colonel Reed.
Get him to the hospital tent!
Sergeant Walker, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
The guns and the rest of the men, where are they?
We lost them, sir.
Step inside, Captain.
I want to see Captain Coburn.
- You can't see him now.
But, I can't...
No, Captain I won't allow another mission to leave here.
You said the Tonto Apache were joining Cochise.
What does that mean?
They're preparing for an all-out attack.
Exactly, and they might hit any time.
That's why we've got to have those rifles.
I need every man here to have even an outside chance of defending this place.
I can't send half my command off on some wild goose chase now.
Then give me four men,
I'll get those rifles back.
You had 11 when you lost them.
That mean I can't go, Colonel?
That's exactly what I mean!
You failed once, Captain and put us in deep trouble.
One more failure would mean certain disaster.
Don't you understand?
We've got the fight of our lives trying to hold this place.
You see those people out there?
They were all depending on you.
And they'll all be dead this time tomorrow, but by God we'll go down fighting.
And you're asking me to send more troopers?!
What's the matter with you?
I am relieving you of your command, Captain.
You'll fight when we're hit but you have no further authority here.
If we survive, a court martial will decide your future in the Army.
That will be all, Captain.
I said, that will be all!
Ellen!
Sorry, Ellen I wanted to tell you myself.
That'd make it a little easier for you.
Easier?
Both my brothers are gone and you're going to make it easier for me.
How?
You said you'd watch out for them!
You promised to bring them back!
Why didn't you?
I tried. When the Apache hit,
I tried to put them in a safe place.
A safe place?
You stand there without a scratch yet both my brothers are dead and you left them in a safe place?!
Ellen, didn't the Sergeant tell you?
Doug's not dead, he's alive!
Oh I don't believe you!
They're both dead.
No, they're not.
Well then, where is he?
Where's Doug?
He deserted, but he is alive.
You're lying!
Doug would never desert, he's too loyal.
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have let him join the Army.
He wasn't the kind to make a good soldier.
He was so timid and didn't like fighting.
He couldn't even stand the sight of blood.
But, he'd never desert
Mother and me.
It's true, Ellen, he went with them.
Well, then they forced him to go.
They forced him!
If he's alive I know he'd be back.
Just as well get that out of your mind, he's not coming back.
Why?
Because he is a deserter and if he comes back he'll be shot.
You could, couldn't you?
You could shoot a poor, frightened boy!
Oh, it's funny how blind
I have been about you.
It's funny I didn't see it long ago the way that you force your men, expecting them to be as strong as you are!
Well, you're cruel, Bruce, cruel and brutal!
The way you beat up that man coming up here!
You beat his face to a pulp because he wanted a dipper of water?!
Oh, it's funny I didn't see then how truly heartless you are.
No wonder Doug ran off, no wonder they all went, you drove them to it!
They ran off to get away from you.
Now, just a minute!
Maybe I did make a mistake, but you might as well hear all of the story.
Doug didn't desert to get away from me.
He could've saved Mike's life and he didn't do it.
He didn't want to come back and face you, that's why he deserted.
No. No!
Coburn knew that because of his failure the entire camp could be overrun by the Apaches.
The Colonel had ordered him confined to post but a heavy weight of guilt made him decide to disobey that order and take the gamble of going alone after the guns.
Soldier.
Yes, sir?
I need your sidearm.
Do you mind saddling that horse?
- Yes, sir.
The Captain hoped to pick up the track of the rifles by daybreak.
He studied the trail taken by the deserters.
At least he had a fresh horse for the search ahead.
Whoa!
Your pack horse just about had it.
Riding all night through these mountains,
I bet we didn't cover ten miles.
That's right, Fuller, we didn't run into any Apache, either.
Now look, we'll hole up here, hide our v aluable merchandise.
You keep talking about how v aluable these are.
I wonder if we'll live long enough to cash them in.
Know what your trouble is, Higgins?
You don't have any faith in me.
Yeah, it about sums it up.
Give me a hand here, hold it up.
You treat all this stuff with love and care, boys.
This here rifle I'm holding...
...is worth a thousand dollars in pure, raw gold.
Ooh-wee!
Yeah but worth's one thing, getting's another.
Don't you worry about that, Higgins,
I'll get it.
I'll get a thousand dollars apiece for these rifles, maybe more.
See, boys...
...I'm a first-class salesman, a travelling salesman.
This here's my sample case.
How far you travelling, Bodine?
- Oh, not too far.
My best customer is up in those hills somewhere.
Cochise?
That's right, boy.
Apache gold is what I'm dealing for.
You said we were going to sell those guns in Mexico!
What's the matter, sonny, you getting cold feet?
Want to go back... to a firing squad?
I'll be glad to dump these rifles.
We can start making better time.
Our next stop will be Mexico where all those senoritas hang out.
Yeah, and ol' Cochise's next stop will be Apache Wells.
Well, I'm glad you boys are beginning to appreciate just how well I use this head of mine.
What are you talking about?
Ha, the Army will be too busy fighting Cochise to send anybody chasing us.
You already got the Army wiped out and you ain't even found Cochise.
There you go worrying again,
Higgins. I won't have to find him.
I get close enough, his braves will find me.
They'll cut your throat before you get a chance to talk to him.
Oh no, this is my insurance.
He needs these guns a lot more than he needs my scalp.
Keep a sharp lookout.
Time enough to let down after we get across the border.
Come on, let's go.
Sonny boy, you take care of the horses.
Listen, I'm going to go up there and pick me out a spot.
Why don't you all go around the other side, you know, just in case.
Good idea.
The Captain would have given anything to get a crack at Bodine, but recovering the guns was his prime concern now.
Bodine was hurried up into the mountains where Cochise waited with a party of braves.
Soldier, you are a very brave man...
...or a fool.
I'm neither one, just a hunter...
...out after big game.
The hunter was captured by the game he was seeking.
It's the only way I could get to see the mighty Cochise.
The Army insults me!
Sending an underling to parlay!
Nobody sent me, I came on my own.
The White Eyes do not let their soldiers ride alone through the Chiricahuas.
Nobody gave me permission to come.
Then you deserter.
If you want to call it that.
A man who turns on his friends cannot be trusted by his enemies.
We will talk no more.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute!
I'm not asking you to trust me.
You have more of these?
40 rifles, 40,000 in gold...
...if you want them.
Show me the rifles.
I am not like your people, my word can be trusted.
When I see the rifles, you will get the Apache gold that means so much to the White Eyes.
Coburn trailed the deserters back to where they stood guard over the guns waiting for Bodine's return.
Higgins, get away from him!
Let me get a shot at him.
Now, let's go get us an Apache.
I'm scared, Mike.
I'm scared!
I never should have joined the Army.
Get out of the way, Higgins.
That's no excuse.
I've got no use for a coward.
Captain!
Captain!
Get him up, get him off of me!
Doug.
That kid!
I should have known.
The guns!
Where are they?
- Now look!
He say, two men ride away with horses.
We will follow.
But, if this is a trick,
YOU will be the first to die.
Cochise knew he must keep those rifles from reaching the cav alry at Apache Wells.
It's no use trying to outrun them dragging these pack horses.
Give me a hand, will you, Doug?
You going to fight them here, sir?
I'll try slow them down, it's up to you to get the rifles through.
But, I won't leave you here alone, Captain.
You're going to obey orders, soldier.
- Yes, sir.
Sure feels good fighting on the right side for a change.
Come on, help me load these.
- Yes, sir.
Better get going, hadn't you, Doug?
- Yes, sir.
Hup. Hup!
With five guns,
Coburn hoped to buy enough time for Doug to get to Apache Wells.
It's Coburn.
It's Coburn!
Wait a minute, Chief, it's no trick.
I've got the same rifle he has,
I'll get him out of there for you.
I'll get those rifles for you.
At ease, soldier.
There are your rifles, Colonel.
Break them out.
Issue one to each man.
Captain Coburn stayed behind to fight off the Indians, sir.
Alone?
- Yes, sir.
He wouldn't let me stay.
He said it's the only way we could get the guns through.
He could still be alive.
Corporal.
Captain Coburn's in trouble.
I need some volunteers. Mount up.
Think you can ride, son?
Yes, sir!
Go get him.
Yes, sir.
Bodine was caught between the Army and hostile Apaches.
All he could do was try to save his own hide now.
Hyah!
Yes, sir.
Captain sir.
Captain Coburn?
Captain Coburn?
Everything's all right, Doug.
Everything's going to be all right.
Attention!
Forward!
Ho!
Go ahead, Doug.
Oh, Doug!
Good work, Captain.
For once I am glad you disobeyed orders.
So, am I, sir.
The boy made the difference.
Go ahead, Captain.
Well, now friends just lend an ear
For you're now about to hear
The ballad of Cat Ballou

As you stand on the brink
It's sure making you think
About your life...

How come they're now
Gonna hang you?
And how did you begin?
Sumpqua!
All out for Sumpqua.
All aboard.
Catherine, you are on the threshold of life!
You have graduated from my academy with a first-rate education.
Equipped to deal with the unhappiness... and stupidity on every hand.
Remember: Teach as I taught you!
Oh, that man looks clean, at least.
This man is in my custody, and
I don't want nobody near him.
Don't look at him, Catherine!
Oh, a man of God.
Sir, would you look after her?
All aboard! All aboard!
Oh, Catherine!
You were a good student.
I know you'll be a good teacher.
I have to go.
Oh, Mrs. Parker!
Goodbye, darling.
Be a good girl.
She didn't introduce us.
I'm Catherine Ballou.
I'm drunk as a skunk.
I apologize for being in this disgusting condition.
I assure you, I'll not inflict myself on you further.
It's the first time in my life I ever drank.
I took the pledge at the big temperance meeting... in Gratzburg, Montana.
You remember that?
It was a great outpouring of the spirit... and I'll not inflict myself on you any further.
Thank you.
Tennyson.
Spins a good yarn, does he, Tennyson?
He's a great poet!
Poet?
May I?
"I stepped out of the dark barroom... into the street, where the sun beat down unmerciful... and Bent stood a-hollerin'
'Come on out, Kid Shelleen...
I'm gonna blow you clear out of
Tombstone and into hell!'
Tennyson is a good poet.
"Kid Shelleen and the Massacre at Whiskey Slide."
Ma'am, I apologize for my disgusting condition.
I assure you, I will not inflict myself on you any further.
I wish I could do something.
You're very kind... but I got here all the help he'll need.
That's very true.
There's good in the Bible for these times.
Ain't there!
This berth next. If you'll just step in the aisle.
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Sorry!
I reckon I'll never see you no more.
It's been a pleasure knowing you.
Goodbye.
Hallelujah, brother!
I am here to comfort the sinner and return the stray lamb to the fold.
- Let him who's troubled...
- Got a match?
Go on.
Hallelujah, brother!
I am here to comfort the sinner and return the stray lamb to the fold.
- Let him who's troubled, let him...
- Thanks.
You're welcome.
You was saying?
Hallelujah, brother!
I am here to comfort the sinner and...
And all like that.
Now just a minute, pilgrim.
All right. Come on in.
My poor fellow, are there any particular verses you'd like to hear?
I told you.
He's about as religious as a hog.
There's bound to be something in here to help him.
Keep every sheriff easy, move!
Hands over your head!
- Sure glad to see you, Uncle Jed.
- Likewise.
Keep him covered now.
Open wide!
All right. Come on now!
Handcuff him to the pipe.
Hit him! Hit him!
Hit him!
Hold him! I'll hit him!
I'll cuff him to the pipe.
Come on!
Let me have a gun!
- Didn't you take his?
- Didn't you?
He's gonna blast himself free.
Go ahead, jump!
Jump?!
What happened?
- He freed my prisoner.
- Who did?
That Bible-thumper that was with the girl.
- That young lady in lower five?
- Yeah, that's her!
Please!
Right here.
Hey, you in there. Hey, girl!
Come on, miss, wake up! The sheriff wants to talk to you.
Where'd the parson go?
Did you see him?
And my prisoner?
Maybe he's in the next car.
Come on!
I shouldn't have done that!
Oh, sure you should, honey.
No question about it in my mind at all.
It was morally wrong.
But it happened so fast,
I didn't know what to think.
I was afraid he'd hurt you.
That's right!
You know, he'd have blowed my head off!
What are you doing?
I got a catarrhal condition.
Well, you're too close.
Scoot back.
Don't think I was offering unwelcome advances!
I put women on a pedestal, I do.
Further.
I'm up against the side.
It's gonna get mighty uncomfortable!
You won't be here long enough for that.
Get out of here the moment it's safe!
That's what I'm anxious to do!
You think I care to stay any longer than needed?
There are still people out there.
Darn!
I guess I'll just have to stay put then.
Even though it goes against my very grain.
You take your arm away this second!
I am supposed to be a schoolteacher!
I'll scream!
I was only gonna see if the coast is clear!
There's gents out there with shotguns.
What are we going to do?
- You can't stay here!
- I hate shotguns, don't you?
I mean, they leave such an oozy corpse.
But there's one chance in 100 I can make it.
I'll take that chance for your sake!
You a schoolteacher and all.
No, wait!
I'd rather get cut down in the prime of my young manhood... than risk compromising a nice girl like you.
If they get me, though...
I want you should have my watch and chain.
Oh, this is awful!
Ain't it though?
You get away!
I just gotta watch what's going on, don't I?
I'll do the watching.
You get away!
I thought you were lying.
You mean I wasn't?
All right, let's get this one.
They're searching the berths.
What's your name so I can vote for you?
Catherine Ballou.
Mine's Clay Boone.
Goodbye, Miss Ballou.
Cat Ballou, she lived
In Wolf City, Wyoming
And folks here in Wyoming
Live high off the hog
That brand-new firm
Sears and Roebuck
Send them their catalogue
- It's an upright town
- Yeah!
- With kind, wonderful people
- Oh?
- Reliable people
- Sure
- Friendly as can be
- So they say
- When they say, "Howdy," they mean it
- Ha!
- Yep, they're neighborly
- Yep, yep, yep!
If only Cat had behaved
These folks would befriend her
If Cat had behaved
Their hearts they would lend her
But Cat was depraved
To hell now they'll send her
She could have lived like others do
Cat Ballou
Wicked through and through
They'll now be hanging Cat Ballou
Papa, what happened?
- That corral used to be full of horses.
- I got tired of them.
I sold them all off to the Army at Fort Huckaby.
You raised those horses as much as you raised me.
You haven't painted the house since I left!
I like it that way... gray, weathered and full of splinters!
Papa!
Come on, honey.
This is my new bronco buster.
This is my daughter.
- Shalom Aleichem, Jackson Two-Bears.
- Why'd you say Shalom Aleichem?
I'm full Sioux Indian!
I'm not of the Chosen People.
Be stubborn if you want to.
- I ain't stubborn.
- Not much you ain't!
An ex-congressman of these United States... said at the
Chautauqua this winter...
Indians is the Lost Tribe.
- But he won't admit it.
- Just ain't true!
He was an ex-congressman of these United States!
- Papa, maybe he was mistaken.
- Why no, he was not!
Jackson's just got a mean, stubborn streak in him, is all.
I brought Mr. Bernstein, the telegraph operator, out here last month.
And he stood right here... and spoke Hebrew at
Jackson for 10 minutes.
And Jackson pretended he didn't understand a word.
Now I call that stubborn!
I didn't understand a word!
You see what I mean?
Now you get that trunk out.
I'll get the satchel.
Jackson, what's happening?
Your old man's got some roughshod ways.
He's rubbed people the wrong way.
He's a sweet old bear who's harmless!
Don't you think I know?
Nobody in this county would give me a job.
As if I was responsible for what happened to General Custer.
I swear, I was a little baby at the time!
But your daddy... he gave me a job right off.
Full wages too.
I guess I respect and admire him more than anybody.
Then why? This used to be the best spread.
A big outfit's moving in... building factories... to make a real city of Wolf City.
They want your daddy's water rights.
He won't sell them.
I'll build us lunch once the trunk's inside.
I'm gonna do the cooking now that I'm home.
I'm gonna take care of you.
Frankie Ballou?
Beat it, you.
I didn't mean to scream, but he came outta nowhere!
And that nose!
Who is he, papa?
Give me a hand!
- Papa, who is he?
- Tim Strawn, I'll bet you.
You don't know nothing when I say
Shalom, but now you're a know-it-all!
Jackson, who is he?
He's a hired killer.
His nose was bit off in a fight.
If I was gonna be scared, I'd be scared of the one who bit it off!
I can take care of myself.
Don't let it bother you.
- It don't bother me.
- You've gotta do something.
What we're gonna do is go on living!
We're going to eat, sleep and work... and tomorrow we're going to go celebrate the Fall Harvest Day.
Take care of the horses, Jackson.
Mabel!
Well!
Now, there's a game for a sheriff.
Liar's poker!
Our unemployed are off the streets, and the town's safe, all in one stroke.
They made Ed Cardigan sheriff.
- He's too lazy to steal and too dumb...
- Ballou!
Show respect for these ladies...
Take off your hat. You're meeting my daughter, Catherine.
Damn, if it ain't little...
Talk to me any way you please... but this is my daughter, so watch your language!
Nice to see you back in Wolf City, Miss Ballou.
You got any idea who forked a ton of manure down my well?
Well, no.
"Well, no."
You're some sheriff!
Come on, Catherine!
Are you really a sheriff?
Why is it hard to believe?
Why don't you help him?
I think someone's poisoned that water to drive him away.
Yesterday, a man named Strawn came, threatening...
There are ramifications to peace officing you wouldn't understand.
Now, please believe me.
I'm taking care of it my way.
What ramifications?
Don't worry your pretty little head.
Go and have a good time.
Jackson, am I mad!
I know.
I saw you talking to Sheriff Cardigan.
Just like Papa, he pats me on the head and tells me to run along.
What am I gonna do?
They got a gunfighter.
You get a gunfighter.
Jackson, there's a funny, inscrutable look on your face.
I can't tell if you're making fun of me.
Nobody would bother your daddy with
Wild Bill or Bat Masterson around.
Come on, Jackson.
Come on.
- Who could I get?
- Kid Shelleen.
There really is a Kid Shelleen?
He's real and one of the best, to my way of thinking.
What can I do?
Write him a letter.
I'll mail it.
- No call to dance with him.
- No call not to.
He's an Indian!
Scream!
I like Jackson.
You'll make trouble for him.
Look who's talking about trouble.
- Why are you here?
- Looking for you!
- But you're an outlaw.
- Got a price on my head!
Twenty-five dollars for Jed,
$35 for me.
I want to thank you for all your help to my nephew and I.
Where you staying?
On the run ma'am.
Hiding out in the crowd.
Won't inflict myself on you any further.
- Have you got a gun?
- Sure do!
Come home with me.
- Say please!
- Please!
You dance so well.
Simple, to what we learn on the reservation.
Buffalo dance... rain dance... war dance.
- Is a square dance like a war dance?
- This one is.
I wanna talk to you, Lo.
My name isn't Lo.
Wait a minute.
Isn't it?
I thought it was " Lo... the Poor Indian."
It's Custer's Last Stand all over... with me in the middle.
Jackson, you all right?!
Shalom!
Attagirl, Mabel!
One, two and a right!
Mabel, my 6-foot dove!
My little schoolteacher.
I guess we showed them, huh, kitten?
I got north. You take south.
- Where to?
- Straight ahead, on the sofa.
You think those freeloaders are gonna stop Strawn?
They're gunmen. They got a price on their head. They told me.
What a fine place, ma'am.
Nice living room.
Kitchen.
Back of the house.
Bedroom.
You sleep in the barn.
Thank you ma'am.
Always deeper in your debt.
What a good time I had today.
You always pucker before retiring?
Get out of here!
How did you get in here?
Why?
If my father saw you, he'd kill you.
You couldn't wake your father with a 21 -gun salute!
Let's play spoon.
You are absolutely the most...
Well, I guess I figured wrong.
Where you going?
To the barn. The horse snores, but I've slept through worse.
Oh no, don't go.
No! Clay, I gotta talk to you.
We'll talk first.
I can't talk with you sitting on the bed.
Try.
My father's a wonderful man.
Do you realize that?
I sure do.
They hate him!
They're trying to drive him out.
They put manure in his well, made him talk to lawyers... and they sent a gunman to drive him off.
You're dreaming.
No, he's real.
I saw him!
I'll help you pack.
I suppose, to a man like you, this little farm is just dirt.
To him, it's his whole life!
Let him dig in and fight like a man. I'll help you pack.
You are absolutely useless.
You are absolutely right.
Look, why don't you hire a gunfighter? They got one.
You always make that little... in the mirror?
Where you going?
- The barn?
- Don't go!
What now?
Clay, I don't believe it when you say you're useless and cynical.
Everybody has good in him... no matter how depraved and cowardly he thinks he is.
You know... you are a sugarplum.
You better watch out.
There are lots who are as depraved and cowardly as they think they are.
And one of them, one of these days... is gonna eat you right up.
Evening, ma'am.
Air and moonlight sets the bulls to talking for sure.
What do you want?
I wondered if we was staying the night.
I'd take off my boots before going to sleep.
I helped you before.
Will you help me?
Certainly ma'am, anything.
Stay here with us.
Somebody's trying to kill my father.
Jed...
We'll stay, ma'am, to do what we can.
We don't need him then.
I think you do.
My uncle never shot at a man.
It's against his principles.
Is that true?
Yes, ma'am, that's true.
Neither has he.
But we'll stay and do what we can.
As long as there ain't no trouble.
Then there came to town
A gun deadly and frightening
A gun quick er than lightening
Fastest gun you've seen
It was the gun in the hand of
Steel-Eyed Kid Shelleen
Just one look at him
Had folks starting to booger
Wild, wild as a cougar
Proud and fierce and mean
There was no man who was tougher
Tough as Kid Shelleen
He had the eyes of a killer
Cold as the devil
The look of a killer
The look of a devil
The face of a killer
That man was the devil
Just wild and ornery and mean
Kid Shelleen
Kid Shelleen
The fastest gun you've ever seen
Kid Shelleen.
You've had time to sleep it off.
Let me see what Cat laid out 50 bucks for.
- What's holding you up?
- No gun.
All right. Go get it!
I hocked it, I think.
In St. Louis?
You drank up the whole
50 bucks she sent you?
Fifty bucks!
Look what you did to him!
You could've killed him with
50 bucks of whiskey all at once.
Fifty bucks!
How was I to know he was a drunk?
Go on and shoot, kid.
Bang away, old fellow.
You'd like a drink more than a sharp stob in your eye.
He did it!
He missed the barn.
Sir, if I could just have a nip to steady my hands.
I had the typhoid real bad.
I had a rough trip down here.
I didn't get no sleep.
If I had a little nip, you know...
Please!
You got the bottle you carry to make the sheriff mad?
Give him some.
You're an Indian, ain't you?
It's all right. I got nothing against Indians.
They was a breed of men in the Old West!
But it's over for them, like it is for the gunfighter.
Except we didn't get no reservation or get taught how to weave rugs.
See you later, son.
It's all over in Dodge.
Tombstone too.
Cheyenne, Deadwood, all gone.
All dead and gone.
Last time I come through Tombstone... big excitement there was the roller rink they laid out over the OK Corral.
I used to work the Buffalo Bill Show
and the Congress of Rough Riders.
I've rescued stagecoach riders from road agents and drunk Indians... in the nick of time.
Twice a day.
Three times on Saturday.
Where'd it go?
You see a man with his eyes set... and his head on a bias and his teeth like a mule's.
He'd as soon hang your guts on a fence as say, "Good morning."
He's a gunfighter.
Proud and feared of nothing... because there ain't nothing he gotta bow down to.
Every man tips his hat.
Every boy knows his name.
Ain't no place he ain't welcome.
When a gunfighter's around, trouble naturally stays away.
Folks saying, "Hiya, Kid!"
"How you doing, Kid?"
"Come in for a pitcher of milk and gingerbread!"
Or, "Come up here and cool your heels. It's hot outside."
Because nobody don't make no fun... of a friend of Kid Shelleen.
Miss Ballou!
I am here!
I never seen a man get through a day so fast.
You leave him alone.
I ain't running no dude ranch for misfits and unemployables.
You keep him away from me.
Where you going now, Kid?
Why, Miss Ballou, you paid me $50.
I aim to stay and earn it.
He can sleep in the barn, Jackson.
It's my gun.
Mr. Shelleen?
Okay if I carry your valise?
Why, sure, kid.
I ain't got no cash.
No need to tip me, sir. It'll be a pleasure to see you at work.
- How many in the opposition?
- Just one. Tim Strawn.
Well, waste not want not.
Where's that jug of yours?
Strawn. You sure?
Silver nose and all.
Let Shelleen do it.
Shelleen's in no condition...
He sure isn't.
Look, I'm counting on all three of you.
Papa's gonna take chances, and I can't let him.
- You gotta stick with him.
- Yes, ma'am.
No matter where he goes!
All right, you unemployables, let's get the work done.
For the love of Mike!
A drunk in the bunkhouse, and a circus following me!
Don't let him out of your sight.
Does Shelleen have tobacco?
- He'd set fire to the barn.
- He's sleeping it off.
Do you mind?
What do you boys think you're doing?
Cat said stick with you, and stick it is!
She's crazy, I tell you!
Always has been.
She sees things.
Her mother was like that.
In the middle of the night, she seen moon men... creeping down the walls.
Get away!
I could trip on you and get trampled in the crowd.
Why was I cursed in my old age... with a nutty daughter and slack-twisted idiots?
Who's here to threaten me?
You see anyone over there?
Or there?
Or over that way?
You see anybody anywhere?
Now stand back and let me breathe!
Drop the gun belts.
You're a murderer!
You're gonna hang!
What is it?
What's wrong?
You killed my father!
That can't be.
He's been here all morning.
No, I saw him.
- He was in that rocker all morning.
- It's a fact.
Why do you say that?
Just telling the truth.
So that's the way it's gonna be.
Better get outta here.
Get her off of him.
Get her outta here!
Just a minute. Don't you do that!
Put that gun away!
You stop it!
You won't make me cry.
You'll never make me cry.
There are teardrops in her heart
But they can't make her cry
There are teardrops in her heart
But they can't make her cry
She's lost all the kin
That she's known
And the tears will turn into stone
All the teardrops in her heart
'Cause they can't make her cry
It's not very hard to grieve
When you're a little girl
It's not very hard to grieve
When you're a little girl
But they made a little girl feel
like a woman made of steel
makes no difference how they try
They'll never...
make her...
cry
- You're on private property.
- Get out of my way!
What have you done to him?
- Why is he smiling like that?
- That was hard, little lady.
My father never smiled like that.
He'll smile on now, forever, just as you see him.
Free from Wolf City's
Development Corporation.
- You rat! Get out!
- Have respect for the dead!
We dug a grave behind the barn.
We'll stay to make sure you leave before morning.
All right, you take the ranch.
I don't want it, now that he's gone.
But you tell Wolf City...
I'll make Sherman's March look like a bird walk.
Ma'am?
She ain't got no place to go, Clay.
We'll take her with us.
Are you tetched?
We can't take her there.
- Where?
- Hole in the Wall.
Hole in the Wall.
It's no place for school teaching.
Besides, we don't even know if they'll take us in.
Of course they'll take us.
It's for outlaws, isn't it?
You just need a price on your head, and you've got that!
We sure do.
It's all settled.
I'm coming with you.
I'm loaded for bear.
Let them come.
Anybody wanna try on Frankie Ballou, gotta take Kid Shelleen.
Mr. Shelleen, don't you see what's going on?
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Frankie
Happy birthday to you
So that mournful day
Became part of a legend
The real start of a legend
Known as Cat Ballou
They'll never make her cry
The day the law filled her heart
With a hate that grew
makes no difference how they try
They'll never make her cry
When you have no tears
Then you've gotta have something
Hate really is something
Blood is what you need
They'll never make her cry
And Cat Ballou made her mind up
To make this country bleed
makes no difference how they try
They'll never make her cry
I smell a water hole!
Hi, honey!
How about a little bubbly?
Later, sister.
Bartender!
Hello in there!
I want a drink!
What's all the...
Shelleen!
Think of that, Hedda!
It's Shelleen!
Cassidy!
What happened to you?
Calvary, Pinkertons...
The West has changed.
For us, business is lousy.
If we didn't have a price on our heads, we'd get out of this hole.
Why don't we have a drink for old time's sake?
"Old time's sake" means you got no cash. Nothing doing.
Hold these for me till I get some money.
Please, Cassidy!
A matched brace of pistols with carved pearl handles.
Sentimental value alone, they're worth 5 or $600 each.
Them ain't pearl-handled.
And they ain't your guns.
Anyways, no good no more, Kid.
Nobody cares.
Well, uncle...
I guess we'll go back into business.
Remember the Herefords in Yatrona County?
Anybody for buying a round?
You'll need more than just two of us.
What about you, Jackson?
You being an Indian and all. You just gonna go back to living off the land?
You fooling? You try living in the mountains with only a stone ax.
We'll all amble over to Yatrona
County and help ourselves to...
50 head.
Fifty head! That's big!
- I'll drink to that!
- Then it's all settled.
Wait a minute!
You got something to say about our plan?
I'm against it.
I understand your objection to rustling, a girl with your upbringing.
- It's the only way to raise money.
- No, it's not!
What do you think we ought to do that's fitting and proper?
Rob a train.
That butcher, Eggers, he'll take 35 head... and butcher them himself.
What about what I said?
Look, this is the Wolf City
Tribune of two days ago.
"200 workingmen stand ready for work on Monday... on the largest slaughterhouse outside Chicago."
What's that got to do with a train?
Workingmen gotta be paid, right?
There's gonna be a payroll coming.
- That's maybe 1000, $2000?
- I will drink to that!
- Can't hold up no train.
- Why not?
- Lots of reasons.
- Name them.
We're not robbers.
If you didn't try new things, there'd be no progress.
Look, you're outta your mind!
Squeeze blood outta them in your dreams!
Build your life anew.
This studying on revenge is turning your back on the future... and letting the past eat at your heart.
They can't get us in Hole in the Wall.
We can use Shelleen's own plan for train robbery.
My plan?
"Chapter Seven."
"The Whiskey Slide and
Tuskegon railroad had a car... that was bandit-proof.
That was a challenge and a matter of pride... to see that it was robbed."
And so on and so on.
That plan!
All right!
You all say you love me and are beholden to me.
"Take it easy.
We'll take care of you!"
The first time I ask you to do one thing for me, like rob a train...
Listen, Miss Ballou!
Some gang!
A horse-ranch Indian, a drunken gunfighter, a sex maniac... and an uncle!
Now look here...
Clay Boone's gang of chicken rustlers.
I'm gonna do it alone!
Hey, did we say no?
Quit your crying.
We'll do it!
- You will?
- This is the last thing. Crazy dame!
That plan?
What in the blue-eyed world?
I'm taking a bath.
What's so odd about that?
I'm looking for the baggage car.
Well, it's the other way, man!
- Pull those drapes! I'm freezing!
- Yes, sir.
Much obliged!
More water, more water.
Here she comes!
Come on, we got a job to do.
Do we!
My word!
Hey, let me outta here!
He's alive!
We gotta let him out!
What happened?
Put up your hands!
Keep them up!
Let me in!
- Who's in charge?
- I am.
What's the delay?
It's a train robbery.
Get along with it.
I'm trying to take my bath.
Here's the safe.
Okay, you, open up!
Nope.
Come on now! Open it!
- I got a gun.
- You'll just have to use it.
- What are we gonna do?
- I told you this could happen.
What's wrong?
He won't open the safe.
That right, mister?
7 left, 26 right, 14 left.
This is more than the
$2000 you said.
Nearer 40 or 50,000, I'd say.
We take this, they'll booger us forever!
Who's afraid of a little booger?
I give up! Hand me a towel!
- Come on, jump.
- Jump?!
Let's get outta here!
We did it! My little gang of sweet outlaws!
The messenger seemed like a nice man.
Shelleen, it was a great plan!
Yeah, we're just like clockwork.
You sure?
I am so proud of you!
It's just beginner's luck.
We gotta get moving.
- Clay's right.
- Ask him how we'll get outta here.
You escaped in that book, right?
Of course he did!
You darling, Shelleen!
We ride out separately in case they track us.
We'll mix up our trails and meet at Hole in the Wall.
Right!
Come on, boy!
Stupid beast!
Damn!
It took a crafty female brain
To stage the holdup of a train
She planned it to the last detail
Until it couldn't fail
This dash and daring desperado
Lead her gang with cool bravado
They would follow where she lead
They made the country bleed
Round and round and round they went
Till man and gal and beast were spent
Round and round and round they rode
Oh, what an episode!
Cassidy, cut your throat!
We robbed old Number Seven.
Drinks on the house!
Hedda, you old heifer.
We got money!
The train guard, hair all over
6-foot-5 of him, praying:
"Kid, Kid, please don't kill me!"
Everything went slicker than...
- Where are those kids?
- Ain't been seen.
Will you lend me a bullet?
You remember me? Old...
Old...
I'm telling you, Cassidy... they're coming with the payroll.
It was just like old times.
Money, money, money for a rainy day!
They are here! Cut your throat!
Help me clear this table.
Get it out there.
Where you two been together all alone?
- Losing that posse.
- Was he bothering you?
No siree bob!
His uncle Jed was right on the job.
- Old Steel Eyes is jealous!
- You got no respect!
Time was I'd squeeze a pimple like you.
What's the matter with you two?
Give the old man a drink.
There's more where that came from.
You mean it? He really did do it?
We did it, Mr. Cassidy.
My gang!
It's just the beginning.
We'll wipe out Wolf City!
You help me and I'll make you rich.
"Wolf City Development."
"Property: H. Percival."
- She stole their payroll, Hedda.
- Of course.
You ever hear of
Mr. Sir Harry Percival?
He owns Wolf City Development, which owns Wolf City... which lets us alone.
We don't bother them nor Sir Harry
Percival, and they don't bother us.
Sir Harry Percival.
That's the man I should be after.
How you gonna find him?
You won't help us?
Cut our own throats?
Hole in the Wall's impregnable.
No such thing.
It's more trouble than we're worth to dig us out.
Now you made it worthwhile!
Some gang of cutthroats and murderers.
We whispered your names when we were kids... scared to say them out loud.
How sad.
You got old.
Count out the shares.
Give them all drinks on Cat Ballou.
Some schoolteacher! Cat's College of Bust Them in the Nose!
What was that for?
I think we'll go to St. Louis.
St. Louis?
City on the Missouri... end of the Santa Fe, jump off of the Oregon Trail.
Produces beef, beer, shoes... and good times.
But why?
We got the money. Why wait till they come looking for it?
They're where we want them.
They're desperate!
They're desperate?
Let's go to St. Louis.
I think I love you.
There you go, all serious all of a sudden.
You're like all the rest of them, you gotta be in love.
Come on! Don't be so serious!
You're nothing like you think you are.
How's that?
Cowardy custard.
You're selfish and a little stupid.
But you're not cowardly at all.
Well, I mean... when you admire a man, you just go all out.
Love is not blind. I see all your faults, and I don't care.
I love you anyway!
Love! I was gonna take you to St. Louis!
Just throw our hats in the air.
Now I don't know.
Trouble's coming, and not just from them.
Where else do you see it?
Right there... in those big blue eyes.
Ain't gonna get tied down with no girl. No, I'm going.
You know, you're gonna get yourself killed.
What do you care?
My death's hardly gonna cause a ripple in St. Louis.
I'm leaving.
I never promised to be no hero, did I?
You're no hero, so don't worry about it.
You've no right to think what you do about me.
Why don't you just go?
Bye!
What's happening?
It's ghost sickness.
It's Indian religion, see.
We believe what the gods did when they made a man crazy was... make him fall in love.
Well, that's very poetic.
What's it got to do with us?
Who's in love with who?
With "whom."
That's another question.
What am I gonna do?
Ain't much you can do about us.
I reckon I'll see you later, ma'am.
What about you?
You'll stay, won't you?
I get a kick out of being on the winning side for a change.
Sir Harry wants his money, fast!
If you wasn't a girl...
I'd split you like a chicken.
Jed!
What do you want, Cat?
That man with the silver nose was here. He's gonna kill me.
Strawn!
You know that valise of mine?
You go find it.
Get a case of cartridges from Cassidy.
We'll always be here with you, ma'am.
It'll be all right, Cat.
Everything's gonna be okay.
What's in this?
Want a drink?
No booze.
Hello, Kid.
Long time.
Sit down.
Where you been keeping yourself?
You want a job?
Some money?
Not money and not a job...
What then?
That!
There never was any love lost between us.
Well?
I can't.
Why not?
A gunfight.
Oh, it was just swell!
Just the way I figured it'd be.
Even when we was kids, he'd sneak behind some kid and back shoot them.
I know this, see.
So when I walk in, I gab with him.
I figure to call his shot when I turn my back.
He don't even believe it's me.
He thinks I'm still on the booze like last time in Tombstone.
When was that?
Ten or 12...
How that booze will do your mind!
Fog your mind so you can't remember a darn thing.
It was just fine.
You and Strawn use to play when you were children?
He was my brother.
It's like that time in Tombstone when he made me walk... stripped down to only my long-handles and my hat.
I took him just like the dime novel says.
It was just fine.
Kid, your own brother?!
Kid Shelleen and Cat Ballou.
- Old Steel Eyes brought the roof down!
- Hold it!
Half of Wolf City's on the way up here.
We'll take them like the last time.
Now they got 50 of that Englishman's goons, and more are coming!
Sir Harry Percival!
He owns Wolf City Development.
He's here himself!
What do they look like?
Are they professional men or barroom sweeps?
Now you just stop and concentrate... because you are scared and confused.
Big men!
Dutchmen from Pennsylvania...
Pols from Chicago...
Swedes from Dakota.
Hard!
With Strawn dead, they're just barroom sweeps.
Strawn was just a hired hand.
This is an army!
And I'm taking you with me.
Are you sure it's him?
That Englishman wants a fight?
We'll give him the biggest gunfight ever.
He wants to die!
I've done everything.
There's no place I want to go back to.
It'll be history.
Kid Shelleen and Cat Ballou.
You old bag of guts.
You'll get her killed too.
It's better than dying in some dirty hotel.
I always feared dying in the gutter with a bellyful of booze.
Then Cat came along.
There's still places I want to see and things I want to do.
I don't want to die.
Now you're making sense!
Let's go to St. Louis.
You don't ever change, do you?
Not St. Louis?
How about Sioux Falls?
Or any place!
You afraid someone will see you with me?
I'll even marry you!
Marry me!
That's what I said.
If that's what I gotta do to save you...
I'll do it!
Of all the self-centered, egotistical things I ever heard!
Why do men think marriage is the only thing we want?
Why don't you go fight or wash your socks?!
I've been studying on it.
And now I'm beginning to see.
She loves you. Not me.
Come on now, Steel Eyes.
And you, all the time laughing at me.
Silly old man looking after that young thing.
- I'm gonna see you do the right thing.
- Right thing?
Guns, bottles, fists, knives, clubs... all the same to me.
The same to you?
What're you saying?
- Marry her!
- I will, but she don't want me!
Don't listen to her! Marry her!
I'm telling you, she won't marry me!
First, you can't stand to get hit.
But you can take it because the blood don't matter, and you're gonna live.
It's a great gift I'm giving you, to know it don't hurt.
Fight!
I'm gonna straighten you out once and for all!
Leave him alone!
I'm beating up on him.
He's my kin! His morals have been a millstone around my neck!
What was that for?
Everybody else did it.
I got a right to, without regard to race, creed or color... according to the 14th Amendment.
Can I have my store back, now that she's going?
It's Cat. Where's she going?
Sir, a consolation from the town.
Sir Harry Percival, I presume?
Really!
Roughing it on the frontier, what?
Delightful!
You like our wide open spaces.
Positively charming, lovely country and lots of fresh air.
I'm getting frightfully healthy, you know.
It's just simply gorgeous!
Simply gorgeous.
Don't let anybody ever tell you different.
Look at that!
A painting on the ceiling.
Yes, that's a Tintoretto.
- I'll say it is.
- Do you like it?
I think it's even more gorgeous than the girl above Paige's bar.
And that's the most gorgeous thing I ever saw.
My name's Trixie.
Oh, Trixie!
May I offer you something to drink, Trixie?
What would you like?
Bubbly, if you got.
Champagne, Hansen!
They told me you had a wine cellar, but I didn't believe it.
Hardly a cellar.
A bin actually, in the pantry.
I never did see a train like this before.
This is the master bedroom.
Do you approve?
Oh, it's swell!
A regular Tintoretto.
Do you like the bed?
Oh, do I like the bed!
That will be all, tonight.
A little wine with music.
Nineteenth century science...
Stone Age atmosphere... caveman passion!
My wallet is in the top drawer.
You won't get away with this, Trixie.
My name isn't Trixie, Sir Harry.
It's Catherine.
I'm Frankie Ballou's daughter.
So you're Cat Ballou.
Sign this.
What is it?
A confession that you hired Tim Strawn... and are responsible for my father's murder. Sign it!
And if I refuse to sign it?
I'll kill you.
Now why do I doubt that?
Don't you doubt it, Sir Harry.
But I do.
I don't think you have it in you, Miss Ballou.
Give me that gun.
Well, it's time.
Come on, don't just dawdle.
Everybody's waiting.
Waiting?
Looking forward to it, I might say.
I'm sorry they don't like me.
You can't blame them, can you?
Killing Sir Harry put the kibosh on the whole slaughterhouse, right?
No jobs. No payroll.
You took the bread out of half the mouths of Wolf City.
You haven't got any friends.
Ready, reverend?
Hallelujah, brothers!
I am here to comfort the sinner and return the stray lamb to the fold.
Let them what's troubled, what's vexed of mind, take heart.
There are many good things in the Bible, sister.
Indeed there are.
It's a better world, we're all bound for.
Where trouble don't come around, sister.
And earthly care is forgotten.
Green pastures await the tired sinner, and honey flows like water.
What a time for you to fall off the wagon.
Look at your eyes!
What's wrong with my eyes?
They're red, bloodshot.
You ought to see them from my side.
We're counting on you.
Quiet, please! Quiet!
Quiet!
If you have any last words, say them now.
Let's get on with it.
By the authority vested in me, this hanging will proceed.
Thank you, sheriff.
God bless you!
Go, Jackson! Go!
Where's Shelleen?
So she rode away
Just where now is a mystery
But Cat rode into history
And her legend grew
She was the queen of the outlaws
Her Highness Cat Ballou
Well, our story now is through
We'll say farewell to Cat Ballou

I bet you ten bucks the steps of that train don't stop no more than...
_... one foot from that line.
_ Show a little respect.
_ Five bucks!
_ Cut it out. We're here for a funeral.
_ Which way is town?
_ Just follow the road. You can't miss it.
You... you know him?
No, but I know that type.
And I don't like it.
What do you suppose he's doing here?
We'll find out soon enough.
Excuse me.
_ Isn't there anybody else getting off?
_ No, sir.
I guess he ain't coming.
May as well go on with the funeral.
Oh, thaùs a good way of putting it.
You coulÔve won yourselves five bucks apiece.
Did anybody else get off that train besides yourself?
Nope.
_ You know a man name of John Elder?
_ I know of him.
Would you be afraid of him?
No. But you must be.
Thaùs why people hire me. They're worried about somebody, or scared.
Don't go jumping to any conclusions.
I didn't know that John Elder was even in these parts.
He probably isn't.
Maybe all you'll have to do to earn your money is hang around for a while and then go back on another train.
Look, I don't care what I have to do, as long as I get paid.
You'll get paid.
Stow your gear in the house.
What are you hiring a gunman for, Pa?
You're too young to remember John Elder.
_ Whaùve the Elders got to do with us?
_ Not the Elders, just John.
What does he have to do with us?
When he left here, this ranch belonged to his family.
_ This is our land. We own it, don't we?
_ Of course it is, son.
Sure it is. Iùs just that he might want to figure it differently.
And we need this land.
We're gonna keep it.
Thaùs a peculiar way to dress for a funeral.
Could turn out more than a funeral.
I don't get your point, as John Elder didn't get off the train.
That doesn't mean he won't show up.
Even so, a man isn't likely to shoot up his own mother's funeral.
_ Not without good reason.
_ He might think he's got a good reason.
Besides, there's that other one that got off the train.
Ben, John Elder isn't wanted for anything around here. Remember that.
He's a gunfighter. That puts him on one side and me on the other.
And it was you who told me that in the first place.
Almighty God, we commend the soul of our dear and pretty sister departed,
Katie Elder, into your care, as we commit her body to the ground beside her loved husband.
Katie Elder, a woman beloved of all.
A hard_working, honest woman.
She helped in your work,
O Lord, in a thousand ways.
She was a friend to all, a comforter to the sick.
She has left this world a little better for having lived in it.
Those who knew her and loved her are better for having lived in the warmth of her understanding.
Katie Elder lived here in Clearwater for many years.
All of us gathered here today knew her well.
She raised four sons, John, Tom,
Matt and Bud, the youngest.
She was a woman who wanted nothing for herself, wanted only to give rather than to receive.
She devoted her life to helping her family, her friends.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
In the sure and certain belief in resurrection unto the eternal life.
O God, whose mercies cannot be numbered, answer our prayers on behalf of thy servanùs soul...
...and grant her an entrance into the land of light and joy...
...in the fellowship of thy saints. Amen.
Amen.
You know, she sold me a blind horse once.
A woman doing that to me.
She really suckered me good.
This is Katie.
She was named after your mother.
She's a handsome baby.
I just thought you would like to know it.
_ One of you missing, ain't there?
_ Yes, sir. John, the oldest.
He moves around a lot.
_ If there's anything I can do...
_ Thank you, Parson, you done plenty.
Done what? Wrote a few letters?
No, sir, that was a real nice sermon you gave.
She belonged to have pretty words spoke over her, and I didn't do it.
I thought you spoke good,
Parson, real good.
Not good enough, not for her.
I don't suppose you'd know that.
_ Billy.
_ Hello, John.
You ought to have better sense than that, coming up behind a man.
You're as fast as you used to be, maybe faster.
_ Been getting lots of practice?
_ Still haven't got a newspaper here?
No, but we do have a gossip about every twenty feet.
Why did you come into town the back way, John? You figuring on trouble?
There's always somebody looking for some. Clearwater's no different.
But thaùs one thing
I don't want, Billy... trouble.
_ How long you planning to stay?
_ I don't know. I just got here.
People usually let you take your hat off
'fore they ask you to leave.
I'm not asking you to leave. I'm just asking how long you figure to stay.
Is there any reason why I shouldn't stay?
Yes, as a matter of fact, there's a couple of reasons.
For one, this ain't your home any more.
You gave that up some years ago.
Go on.
And two, another man came to town today.
I understand he's real good with a gun.
_ Who is he?
_ I don't know. He's a stranger.
But I understand he hires out.
And three,
I've got myself a young deputy who's real conscientious about his job.
_ Am I wanted for anything, Billy?
_ No.
_ Then I got a good idea.
_ Yeah?
You send that young deputy over to run that other fellow out of town.
I guess thaùd be one way of doing it.
The only thing is, he's not wanted for anything, either.
I come to town to see Ma buried, and to maybe say hello to my brothers.
_ Any objections?
_ No.
_ Fine.
_ You want to see the boys, go that way.
_ You won't have to go through town.
_ The ranch is over there.
Not any more.
Morgan Hastings owns it now.
Kate was living in the Lupin place when she died.
_ When did that happen, Billy?
_ Your pa was killed six months ago.
_ Who did it?
_ I haven't been able to find out.
John...
Don't do anything foolish.
You've been trying hard not to tell me something. What is it?
You know that man that didn't get off the train?
_ The one we're not scared of?
_ What about him?
_ He's back.
_ How do you know iùs him?
Big fellow, about six_four,
200 pounds, tough_looking.
If there's any trouble, make it look like self_defence.
Nobody told me about John Elder until I got here.
And I ain't about to let him draw first.
You do nothing unless I tell you to.
All right, you tell me.
But I'll handle it my own way.
I knew it! The Elders are going to be coming, asking how we got the place.
You stick to your bookkeeping.
I'll handle the Elders.
_ Iùs not going to be easy.
_ Nothing comes easy.
If you want to own a town, you've got to put out something.
I was so little when you and John left that...
Is he really as fast with a gun as everyone says?
When he was a kid, he was the fastest.
I was afraid to be in the same room.
Let me point one thing out.
That work doesn't pay well.
_ I can recommend my line of work.
_ Yeah, larceny.
The hours are better, and you get shot less.
_ Just the same, I wish he'd showed up.
_ Stop wishing. He's here.
_ John.
_ Matt. Been a long time.
Time ain't made you any prettier.
Tom. It hasn't helped you any, either.
_ Don't tell me this is the kid?
_ I'm almost eighteen!
_ Bud started college this year.
_ How about that?
When I went to school, anybody got past four plus four is eight, I cried.
Well, Ma want...
Ma said she wanted me to go.
Yeah.
You got here a little late.
We just got back from the funeral.
I was watching from a hill.
Katie wouldn't have wanted any trouble.
Never stopped you before.
_ How did she die?
_ Doc Isdell said she wore herself out.
She had a stroke and couldn't talk.
Then the preacher wrote to you.
I came to see her about three years ago.
A bit of money to put into that hardware business.
At least I come back.
It didn't matter too much to Katie.
I never was her favourite.
It seems you two were the only ones that saw Ma in the last few years.
Like Matt says, I've been away, too.
Yeah, well.
_ Is it true what they say about you?
_ Only the bad things, Bud.
How many men have you killed?
You'd better ask Tom. He seems to know more about me than I do.
Pretty smart, considering we haven't met for ten years.
I'm asking you. How many?
_ What did Katie tell you?
_ Not Mom, other people.
_ Howdy, Miss Gordon.
_ Hello, Bud.
Miss Mary runs the boarding house.
These are my brothers...
Hello, Matt. Tom. Hello, John.
Iùs been a long time.
You're not that skinny little kid that used to live next door to the Fergusons?
No, I'm the skinny little kid who lived next door to the Mastersons.
I hate to break in on your grief, but you'll need some food.
Katie asked me to look in on you, ifyou came to the funeral.
Thaùs mighty nice of you, ma'am.
I wasn't doing it for you, or any of you.
I'm doing it because Katie asked me to.
She liked that rocker.
She seemed to have confided a great deal in you, Miss Gordon.
If she'd had her sons around her she wouldn't have had to confide in strangers.
She told me what fine men you were, never forgetting her, sending her money, helping her send Bud through school.
She was so proud.
Her tall sons for whom she kept making up lies so she could hide her shame.
Blamed Texas for taking her sons.
Texas is a woman, she used to say, a big, wild, beautiful woman.
You raise a kid to where he's got some size, and there's Texas whispering in his ear and smiling, saying, "Come and have some fun."
"Iùs hard enough to raise children," she'd say.
"But when you've got to fight Texas, a mother hasn't a chance."
Thaùs why she pushed Bud. She let
Texas beat her with the rest of you.
She was going to see Bud through college or die.
Well, she died.
Miss Gordon, tell me, why did she set so much store by this rocker?
Your pa gave it to her. She wouldn't have swapped it for a diamond ring.
Thanks for being so nice to her.
Nice to her? More like she was nice to me, or anybody.
She deserved better from her own.
_ Miss Gordon...
_ I see you're still wearing your gun.
Anybody hungry?
I'll bet you ten to one she's a good cook, too.
I'm glad I didn't bet. I'd have lost.
How did anybody in this family ever get to college?
I didn't want to go to college.
It was either that or jail.
_ For what?
_ They said I stole a horse.
People are trying to stick me with things like that all the time.
_ Did you steal it?
_ I rode him, but I didn't steal him.
Ma wouldn't back me up. There wasn't anything else to do, so I went.
_ You went where?
_ To the School of Mines.
It was September 3rd.
It was a week before school started, and I clumb Pike's Peak.
_ Why?
_ It was there.
_ You done what to Pike's Peak?
_ I clumb it.
_ You didn't, you climbed it.
_ Whaùs the difference? I got to the top.
_ There ain't no such word as clumb.
_ What about the horse?
She went to a lot of bother to get you an education. Why don't you use it?
_ Why did you steal the horse?
_ I didn't.
I was in bed, and I heard someone talking, so I looked out of the window.
And old man Hyselman was claiming I stole his horse.
A grey horse? What did Katie say?
She was as mad as he was, told him to go look if he wanted to.
Then he came out of the barn with his horse, Ma behind him hanging her head.
Then she come in all scared.
_ Ma scared?
_ I never saw her like that before.
She said he was coming back with the sheriff, and I'd better leave the state.
So I took off my pants, put on a suit and left on the morning train.
_ That ain't much of a story.
_ I liked it where he changed his pants.
_ It was just starting to get interesting.
_ Very funny, ha_ha!
Funny.
Bud, how long did Ma live here?
We moved over just after Pa died.
Twelve hundred acres of the best land anywhere. I wonder why she sold.
_ A woman couldn't run it by herself.
_ She must have got some money.
Why don't we go to the bank, split it four ways?
_ Three and a half is more like it.
_ BuÔs got to have money for college.
I ain't going to college.
I'm going with him.
There's one thing you're forgetting.
You ain't been invited.
I'd take you, but I don't know where I'm going.
_ But I ain't going any place I've been.
_ I can take care of myself.
What do you say we settle everything else first and talk about him later?
We'd better see if she left any debts.
Debts? What debts?
Her funeral for one thing.
Who paid for that?
_ She probably owes at the store, too.
_ That can't be much.
I'm going to Hyselman's.
You and Bud go to Peevey's store.
Matt, you talk to Dr Isdell.
We'll meet at the bank.
Howdy, Bud. You don't look any different than when you went to college.
I expected him to come back with a flat hat with a tassel, wearing glasses and looking smart.
Mr Peevey, you remember my brother Tom.
Howdy, Tom.
I was sorry to hear about your ma.
I'll miss her as much as I'd miss my own ma if she went. God spare me the day.
_ We came about Ma's bill.
_ We'd like to settle up.
I think I have it inside. Come right in.
Let me see now. Here it is.
_ How much is that?
_ Six dollars and twenty cents.
I'll cut you for it.
High card, double or nothing.
Hey, Ma? How much for the dresses
Katie Elder made?
_ I thought you paid her.
_ No, I haven't paid for them yet.
The Elder boys are here to settle up.
Four dresses at two fifty, and two guitar lessons at fifty cents.
Four dresses at two fifty, and two guitar lessons at fifty cents.
That means that I owe you four dollars and eighty cents.
Your ma took guitar lessons?
Yeah, I figured she could earn a living playing the guitar in the saloon.
_ Want to hear her?
_ No, thank you. Some other time.
Don't forget your money.
_ Thank you.
_ Drop in any time.
I wish I could tell you that you owed me a hundred dollars, but you don't.
She came in here one day with a big grey horse to sell.
She said,
"Henry, go get your grey horse."
They made as pretty a team as you'd ever see.
So I said, "Whaùs your price, Katie?"
She said, "One funeral."
And I said, "Whose?"
She said, "Mine."
Thaùs the way it was.
Is that the same grey horse that Bud stole?
You heard about that? We rigged that up to scare Bud into going to college.
I put that horse in her barn, and I come back later, yelling, her screaming back at me like she meant it.
She was a wise one, your ma.
And my dad, you buried him, too, didn't you, Henry?
Yeah, high_spirited he was. And he wasn't a man to back down to anyone.
I remember when he was challenged by old Thad to a duel.
Your daddy had the choice of weapons, and it being the Fourth of July, says
Bass, "I choose Roman candles."
Well, sir, they stepped off the ten paces, lit the Roman candles, then they started popping.
Thad dark as thunder, Bass laughing, those balls of fire bouncing off him, him laughing so hard he was missing Thad by six feet.
Finally, one of those balls of fire landed in your daddy's pants.
He grabbed his bottom, ran for the watering trough, sat down in it.
It was the funniest duel I ever saw!
I declare it was.
How did he die, Henry?
From what I could see, he was shot in the back.
Did anybody try to find out who did it?
I don't know about those things.
You'd better ask Billy, or Ben Latta.
All right, Henry.
I figured he'd go to the bank and the store.
But what was he doing at Hyselman's so long?
_ Do you want me to ask him?
_ It wouldn't hurt to ask. But just talk.
_ Mr Venner.
_ Come in.
Looks like you were expecting us.
I thought you might stop by.
Yes, sir, we came over to settle the estate.
Nothing left to settle.
_ Nothing?
_ She didn't leave a dollar.
But she had money last year.
She paid for my schooling.
She must have gotten something out of the old place.
_ Is that what she told you?
_ I just took it for granted.
_ Where did she get her money?
_ Iùs a fine time to start worrying.
I watched her struggle for years, giving guitar lessons for coffee, sewing that paid for your clothes, Bud.
Never a word out of her, except to praise you.
Have you looked into her closet, at her clothes?
You'd find one blue dress for winter and one grey dress for summer.
_ What about the Lupin place?
_ She didn't own the Lupin place.
The bank let her have it for a roof over her head.
She paid rent.
Katie wouldn't take anything off anybody, not with her sons sending her money.
If you plan to stay on here, you'll find that Clearwater's changed.
Big business coming in.
We don't want any bad reputations around here.
Good day, gentlemen.
Mr Venner, what did she do with the money from the ranch?
_ I know she wouldn't just give it away.
_ I wouldn't know about that.
_ Do you keep records?
_ We had a fire.
I can't remember every transaction.
Good day.
Every transaction, or just this one?
Well...
I'd be obliged if you'd use the front entrance.
Your time will come to be carried out the other way.
_ What was John Elder doing in here?
_ Talking.
_ I don't see iùs any of your affair.
_ I'm making it my affair.
_ Who are you?
_ Mr Hastings wants to know.
_ He sent me to find out.
_ I don't care who wants to know.
Oh, yes, I can see where
Mr Hastings might be worried about what I might be talking about with Johnny Elder.
_ So you tell me, huh?
_ No, I won't. You get out of here.
Hey!
_ You all right?
_ Yeah.
_ Who is he?
_ I've never seen him before.
I think he works for Morgan Hastings.
He asked what we were talking about.
Morgan Hastings?
He moved in and seems bent on taking over the county.
He owns your ma's old place now.
I came back to ask if you'd see after
Mom's grave, when you have a chance.
I'd be obliged if you'd keep your money, John.
_ Looking after Katie'd be a privilege.
_ Thanks, Henry. Thank you.
Take you that long to give him a couple of bucks?
_ Leùs go take a look at the old place.
_ What for?
Leùs say I'm homesick.
Everything sure has changed.
Remember how we'd fool around in that barn?
I was a kid when you fell and broke your leg.
You weren't even born.
Besides, I was pushed.
_ Somebody kept pushing me off.
_ Thaùs 'cause you bounced so good.
All the family bragged about how good you bounced. Leùs bounce on down.
_ Howdy.
_ This here is private property.
_ We're looking for Morgan Hastings.
_ Thaùs my father.
But he won't be back all day.
Then maybe you could help us.
You see, this place used to be ours, and now iùs yours.
_ We'd like to ask you some questions.
_ I'm not going to answer.
_ You'd better get off this property.
_ Wait a minute. Don't get all riled.
I'm ordering you. Get off this property!
_ Having trouble, Dave?
_ Yeah.
No trouble. I'm John Elder, and these are my brothers...
_ I told them to leave, and they won't go.
_ Thaùs not strictly true.
I'm not putting up with more trouble from you.
He worked a fellow over in town, and now he won't leave this man's property.
Either you're leaving peaceful, or I'll arrest you.
We wouldn't take too kindly to being arrested.
That ain't going to make much difference.
_ See? Now we ain't arrested.
_ You're going to be in serious trouble.
We're going in with you, straighten this out, but we ain't going in looking guilty.
Get on your horse.
We'll be back.
Billy. Billy! You got to see this.
Come on, come on!
_ What happened, Ben?
_ He got careless.
They jumped me at the Hastings' place.
Thaùs why we came in, to straighten this out. He had no right arresting us.
_ He's wearing a badge.
_ We were just looking for answers.
Next time, it might be an idea to wait till I tell you to light out after somebody.
All right, you Elders, take off.
_ Go on. I'm going to talk to Billy.
_ I'm going with you.
Billy.
Since I got home someone's asking me to leave or pulling a gun on me.
A gunfighter can't be treated like a hero.
_ I'm no gunfighter!
_ You're his brother.
I know how to handle unfriendly towns.
At Katie's grave you said the last thing you wanted was trouble.
_ You drive me out, I'll be back.
_ That goes for me, too.
Why didn't you tell us that Bass was shot in the back?
Does it make any difference which direction the bullet came from?
Yes, if you're trying to find out if he was murdered.
_ What do you want to know?
_ What happened to our old place?
_ If Pa sold it, there'd be money.
_ Not if he gambled it away.
_ Is that what happened?
_ Hastings says so.
I see no reason to doubt him.
He had six witnesses.
Your pa must have been pretty drunk.
He was going to be a better provider for Katie, win a fortune for her.
_ I don't know how she put up with him.
_ She loved him.
_ That was good enough for her.
_ We all loved him, Billy.
It was just that when he got to gambling and hitting that bottle...
_ How long after the game was he shot?
_ Same night.
Wouldn't you say that was a little coincidental?
Even if I did, I couldn't prove it.
_ We can help.
_ I don't need any help.
Isn't it a little late to be wondering what happened?
_ Who shot him, Billy?
_ John, stop digging around.
All iùll get you is trouble.
Trouble.
Hastings.
Miss Gordon, I want to talk to you about Katie's things.
She didn't have much, but we'd be pleased, and I'm sure she'd want you to have anything of hers that you liked, like maybe the rocking chair, and things like that.
Why, thank you, John.
I'd like that very much.
Fine. I'll bring them by.
I can't stand a man that forces himself on a girl who wouldn't be caught dead with him.
They're sure a fine pair, Mr Hastings.
The finest.
_ Southern hospitality, huh?
_ Sorry, gentlemen.
No offence, I was feeling the balance.
Finest duelling pistols ever made.
_ You're two of the Elder boys?
_ Thaùs right.
I'm sorry about your mother.
She was a wonderful woman.
After your father lost the ranch and passed on,
I offered to pay her for the ranch, but she wouldn't hear of it.
_ Well, now, why would you do that?
_ Guilt, Mr Elder.
Yes, guilt. I wanted the ranch.
Yes, I needed it.
This town can grow and become important.
It needs water power for a mill.
The ranch had the water power.
I intended to buy it, not win it in a card game.
No offence meant, could we see the paper that transferred the ranch?
Certainly, of course.
You have every right to.
Iùs right here.
Yes, here it is.
Thaùs where your father made his mark.
And the signatures of the other witnesses.
_ You one of these witnesses?
_ Of course.
_ The rest of these work for you?
_ Occasionally.
What was the game you were playing that night?
_ The game? Blackjack.
_ Blackjack?
_ Are you sure it was blackjack?
_ Of course.
Pa always told us he wouldn't be caught dead playing blackjack.
Shoot his kids if he saw them playing it.
Thought it was a woman's game.
Mr Hastings, you know all the people in this town.
Who do you think was the dirty, stinking rat that killed our pa?
Why ask me?
We aim to find out.
We started playing blackjack with Pa when we were three or four.
We know that, but Hastings doesn't.
Hey, Bud.
"Katie Duane, born Ohio." No date.
"Married Bass Elder,
September 8th, 1850,"
"Clearwater, Texas."
_ We'd better keep this.
_ Why? Leùs raffle it off.
We'll give half the money to the parson.
I think we ought to get her a nice stone for her grave.
A big stone with nice writing on it.
_ What do you call it?
_ A monument. Do you think so, John?
_ She'd like that.
_ Why buy a hunk of stone?
Because there ought to be something to remember her by.
The Ridders got their mother an angel with her finger pointing up.
_ At who?
_ Nobody!
_ All right, then, an angel.
_ Does it have to be an angel?
Besides, some kid shot the angel's finger off, and it looked like she was shaking her fist.
_ We'll get a marble lamb!
_ How about a horse?
_ A horse? For a grave?
_ Ma loved horses.
How'd you like to have a marble horse on top of you for the rest of eternity?
_ Whaùs happened to all of us?
_ You said she'd like a monument.
Yeah, but not that kind. She wanted one of us to amount to something.
She sure drew a flat blank zero!
Not if Bud goes back to school.
Thaùs the kind of monument she wants.
Why me? One of you go amount to something!
_ Iùs too late for us.
_ I won't be no monument.
I'm going with you. We'll be famous, like the Dalton brothers.
Yeah, they're famous, but they're just a little bit dead. They were hung!
We keep the book.
Horses!
_ John.
_ Good evening. I brought the things.
Come on in.
_ This is a nice room.
_ Thank you.
How about... right here?
Thaùs fine.
This is very thoughtful of you, John.
Whenever I look at it or sit in it,
I'll think of Katie.
I brought your things back, and...
...also we thought you should have this.
But iùs your family bible. You keep it.
No, a lot of the places that I go it wouldn't fit in.
All right, I'll keep it. But iùs yours whenever you want it back.
These are yours, too.
They weren't meant for an outsider, but Katie wanted me to know about you.
_ I don't mind.
_ You stopped writing so long ago.
She would read your old letters as if they'd just come.
Then she gave them to me to read.
I don't know how either of you could read them.
_ My handwriting isn't a thing of beauty.
_ But what you wrote was, at first.
Then I began to notice a change.
Your ma never did, but I did.
_ Everybody changes.
_ Not the way you did.
I began hearing things about you.
It wasn't even the same man who wrote those letters.
You're going to look for your father's killer?
I sure am. Whoever killed him probably stole the ranch from Katie.
_ Iùs the least I can do for her.
_ Why? So you can even a score?
Kill again? Maybe do it in front of Bud so he can be proud of you?
Don't let Bud worship you because you're a killer.
Katie wanted Bud to go to college, to make your name stand for something.
I'll be leaving now.
Thank you again for this.
Why wouldn't Katie want me to find Bass' killer?
Because all that means is more killing.
And Katie hated killing.
_ How much money you got on you?
_ Me? Where would I get any money?
_ You got five bucks from Peevey.
_ Spend my own money for a drink?
Pa'd come out of his grave like a scorched cat. Never do that, kid!
_ You just watch. Two whiskeys.
_ Yes, sir.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
Well, down!
_ Bartender!
_ Yes, sir.
Hey, can a fellow get a drink on credit around here?
Sorry.
I'll get us another drink!
Beauty! We'll get us a drink
'cause we're going to have a raffle.
_ Raffle what?
_ My eye! My glass eye.
Who'll take a chance on getting a made_to_order eye?
If you want a drink that bad,
I'll buy you one.
But you wouldn't let a man buy you a drink if you couldn't buy him one back.
All right, sports! Fifty cents a chance, just four bits to win a $22 eye.
I always did want a third eye.
_ Are you playing poker or kid games?
_ Kid games! I'm losing money.
_ I'm in.
_ You can look at it, but don't touch it...
_ I'm in!
_ Oh, yeah! Lay that money down.
_ Thaùs nine.
_ I got seven.
Well, thaùs nine dollars and fifty cents.
I need one more to make it ten bucks.
_ There it is. I want that eye.
_ Well, all right!
Leùs see. We need nineteen white chips and one blue one, because whoever draws the blue chip is going to be the winner of the eye.
_ Shake them up. Who was the first in?
_ I was.
You're entitled to the first draw. Dip in.
Who's going to be the winner of that?
_ Leùs see who's going to win.
_ Get in there.
This tall, good_looking gentleman, see what you come out with.
Seem to be all white chips.
This gentleman took two chances.
You're entitled to two draws.
Dip in and may
Lady Luck smile on you.
He got it!
_ I got it! Give me my eye.
_ Iùs over there.
I might just have it made into a stickpin for Sunday.
_ How much would you take for her?
_ I'm going to keep her.
_ I'll give you three dollars.
_ No, I'll keep her for good luck.
There goes my wedding!
My girl saw me with my patch once.
_ She turned away.
_ You look all right to me.
Pretend you're a girl, and you can see it spoils my manly beauty. Right, boys?
_ Sell it back to him.
_ All right, all right, I'll sell her.
_ Five dollars.
_ Split the difference, and I'll buy a drink.
Done.
Whiskey for the gentleman, give me one, and one for the kid.
Aren't you going to put it back in again?
Put it back in?
Iùd be a little crowded in there.
Be a little crowded in there.
Maybe thaùs funny to you, but not to me.
I say you're a liar and a cheat, just like your old man.
_ You knew my old man?
_ Well enough. He was a drunk, too.
_ Liar!
_ He's only a kid.
Stay out of this! He thinks he can ride along on his brother's reputation.
I don't think so much of his brother, either.
_ He ain't armed!
_ But I am.
_ Stay out of this, Bud.
_ No!
I don't think he's got the nerve.
_ Give him a gun.
_ The boy didn't mean nothing.
He called me a liar.
All I did was tell the truth.
You can take mine, kid.
Go on, pick it up.
I say he comes from a no_good family that don't have the nerve...
John.
This guy just called Pa a liar and a drunk!
That invitation to pick up a gun still hold for Johnny Elder?
You got a chance to prove you don't think so much of him.
Tom, get him out of here.
_ Not till he eats his words!
_ Tom.
Didn't you hear me?
He called Pa a liar and a drunk.
I reckon thaùs what he was, kid.
Now, keep him out.
John...
...get out.
Night, boys.
Where you going, mister?
Finish your game.
_ Hey, Bud, ain't you going to eat?
_ No!
How can I when I think of the things that skunk said about us?
And him, the big gun everybody's always bragging about, he slunk lower than anyone in the place.
_ Shut up.
_ I won't!
Why didn't you let me do something about it?
He'd have chewed you up and spit you out.
Your hand wouldn't have got halfway to that gun.
Katie's going to have something to show for her life.
_ You're going back to school.
_ No, I ain't!
Oh, yes, you are, if I have to carry you there.
_ I won't learn anything!
_ I can't make you do that.
You don't want to tag along with me after I've muddied the Elders' name.
No, and thaùs for sure!
This was Ma's, now iùs mine. I'm going to get that guy. Who's coming?
_ You're not going any place.
_ You going to stop me?
You bet I am!
And thaùs for sure!
_ What the hell did you hit me for?
_ You stood there and let him hit me.
I got him, I got him.
I got him!
_ You got him?
_ Yeah!
Stay out of here.
_ Howdy.
_ Howdy.
I'm right sorry
I missed the start of that.
_ Doing your spring house-cleaning?
_ We're just getting acquainted.
We haven't seen each other for some years.
I'm looking for a Mrs Kate Elder.
This is where she lived.
We're her sons.
_ She died a few days ago.
_ I am sorry.
_ I extend my sympathy to y'all.
_ Thank you.
I never had the pleasure of meeting
Mrs Elder, but I got a letter from her.
Since I had business in Clearwater,
I decided to pay her a visit.
I'm sorry I got here so late.
This is some letter!
Care to read it?
"Mr Charlie Bob Striker,
Pecos, Texas."
_ Thaùs you?
_ It is.
This is Matt and Bud and Tom.
And I'm John Elder.
Howdy.
"Dear Mr Striker, it has been told to me that you have a lot too many horses."
"If this is true, you have my sympathy,"
"as I have been horse poor myself in the past."
"If you are still in this predicament in June,"
"I may be able to help you out and take a hundred head off your hands,"
"provided you are prepared to deal on credit"
"until I can resell them."
"I am interested in good sound stock, but nothing fancy."
"And I would like to hear your rock_bottom price."
"Yours truly, Kate Elder."
Horse poor?
Sounds like she had more brass than the Kansas City fire engine.
It struck me funny, and the more
I read it, the funnier it got.
Finally I said to myself,
"Striker, you've done a lot of fool things."
"You haven't done any lately, and you're overdue." I'm sorry I got here too late.
_ You two woulÔve made a lively team.
_ Well, thanks!
_ Why don't you come on in?
_ Thank you.
But iùll be a favour to my bad knee to stay here.
_ Iùs been nice meeting you.
_ I've got a proposition for you.
I wouldn't blame you if you turned me down.
_ It wouldn't hurt to hear it.
_ I'd like to take those horses.
I'd run them to Colorado, sell them to the miners.
But I've got the same trouble
Mom had. No cash.
_ I'll give you half the profits.
_ What about the rest of you?
_ You in this, too?
_ We ain't been asked.
_ Are you telling or asking?
_ Asking.
It sounds crazy enough to work.
_ Matt?
_ I want to know one thing.
_ Will the money keep him at school?
_ Seems to be the idea.
In that case,
I'll chip in a couple of weeks.
_ Well?
_ You know you almost broke my jaw.
I was trying awful hard to. Thaùs what it seems to take with some people.
_ Well, I guess you made up my mind.
_ How about it?
If I was going to do a fool thing for your mother, I might as well do it for you.
Come to my ranch, and you can have the horses.
_ When do you want to start?
_ A couple of hours.
Good, I'll be waiting.
Well, come on!
Iùs your move, Billy.
Harry, one of these days
I'm going to beat you.
I wish you would.
After losing eight games in a row,
I can hardly consider you a challenge.
_ Where have you been all day?
_ The US Marshal's office.
Take a look at this.
Maybe thaùll prove
I wasn't jumping to conclusions.
Tom Elder's wanted for murder!
_ What gave you the idea?
_ I did.
He knew enough about Tom Elder to send me looking.
I figured Tom for a lot of things, but never murder.
Why not? He's an Elder.
It takes more than a man's name to make him guilty.
_ There's your proof.
_ That doesn't prove he's guilty.
You're working out of hate. Thaùs why they took your gun the first time.
It seems like
I can't do anything right for you, Billy.
Ben, the trouble with you is you're like an owl.
The more light you shine on him, the less he sees.
_ Where are you going?
_ To get Tom Elder.
Not armed like that, you're not.
And go reluctant, not like you enjoy the idea of using that.
_ I'll go myself.
_ They're four of them!
I can count, too, Ben.
Ben's right, Billy. You'll need help.
You figuring on coming with me?
Or are you suggesting
I take along that new man you hired?
He's a good hand.
What are you trying to keep the Elders from finding out, Mr Hastings?
I'm just trying to help.
Sure, just trying to put us on the map, make us all rich.
A man can grow with a town, Billy.
Or die, like Bass Elder.
Ben, you'd better come here.
_ Whaùs the matter?
_ Billy's horse just came in, without him.
Leùs get a posse together, Harry.
Here.
He's still breathing.
You and Roy take him to Doc Isdell.
Meet us at the river.
Go get 'em!
You were pretty good today, kid, pretty handy.
_ Where did you learn that stuff?
_ Not in college.
We're just trying to make you rich and respectable. You fight us every step.
I don't want to be rich and respectable.
I want to be like the rest of you.
_ Is he sassing you again?
_ I don't know what to do with him.
_ Ain't you no respect for your Elders?
_ That ain't funny. I heard it before.
Katie would have bloodied our backsides with a birch for talking back.
Which one of you is man enough to fill in for Ma?
Oh, no. Oh, no, you wouldn't!
No, hey, no!
Come on!
Fellows! I thought I taught you better than to take a bath with your clothes on.
There's a posse up there.
What do you suppose they're after?
It can't be us. Unless they think we stole these horses.
_ Iùs Ben Latta. They must be after us.
_ What are we going to do?
We've done nothing wrong.
We won't act like it.
We'll just pick up these horses and start out like we were just passing through.
There's four of them.
Iùs the Elders all right.
I told you not to fire! I want 'em alive.
_ Bud?
_ I'm all right.
Whaùs this for?
_ Stealing horses is against the law.
_ So is shooting 'em.
We got these legal, and we can prove it.
I don't expect you all to believe us, but Billy will.
_ Then why did you shoot him?
_ Billy's shot?
Shot but not dead.
He'll tell us who did it...
...when he tried to bring Tom in.
This doesn't make sense.
If we were running away and had shot
Billy, why pick up a herd of horses?
_ And bring them through Clearwater?
_ Throw your guns on the ground.
Do as he says.
More killings won't prove anything.
A couple of you tie them up.
_ We've got all them horses.
_ Their owner will find them.
I've got a letter from the owner.
_ That don't do much for Billy.
_ We didn't do it.
Billy was at the Lupin place when he was shot.
_ The Lupin place?
_ Yeah. If they try anything, shoot 'em.
I'm making you a present.
You can have all the good deeds.
What good deeds?
A good deed for Ma.
Ain't that why we're here?
We're here because you got yourself on a wanted poster.
You make it personal for a man thaùs been in a few scrapes himself.
Tell us what happened.
Some bartender got sore because I was raffling off my eye.
Started banging away at me with a.45.
_ I did the only thing I could do.
_ It was self_defence.
Why didn't you stand trial and clear yourself?
Because it was his town and I was an outsider.
Look.
_ How's Billy?
_ I don't know.
_ You think we did it, too.
_ I don't know what to think.
If only you'd gone away after the funeral.
Whiskey. Hate.
Seems like everybody in this town's made up their mind.
Go on home, Mary. Stay home.
I don't want you around here.
Billy's dead.
Go on.
Did he say who shot him?
He never opened his mouth to say you didn't.
_ Get a rope!
_ Leùs hang them!
I told you to go home.
_ What about that mob?
_ They had a feeling for Billy.
_ Tell them Billy wouldn't lynch a man.
_ Four men.
Three men and a boy. How can you be so sure they're guilty, Ben?
They're convinced.
The same that would make up a jury.
You arrest them. You don't judge them.
Get the marshal to come here.
Quit telling me how to do my job.
Did you see the way them people are looking at us?
Yeah, I saw.
And we're getting out of here.
You figure on doing it different?
They come to feed us in the morning, we'll get the key.
_ How's it look?
_ Not good, Judge.
_ Better set their trial for in the morning.
_ Pick a jury out of that mob?
It wouldn't be justice. Iùd be murder.
We got enough of those, Charlie?
No, we ain't. Them guns ain't going to stop no mob, and you know it.
_ Do you want to let them in?
_ Don't you talk to me like that!
Me and Billy Wilson never lost a prisoner, mobs or no mobs.
He broke 'em up, and without no guns, neither. I seen him do it.
But then you ain't no Billy Wilson!
_ He didn't mean anything.
_ Why don't he use his head?
If he was a patch on Billy's shirt, he'd get those boys out of town before iùs too late.
Look out there.
Them's friends of yours until now.
But pretty soon you'll be shooting bullets at 'em. You will.
We'll move 'em.
We'll move them to Laredo early in the morning.
Tom, somebody's coming!
I guess they changed their mind.
Yell out to one of them deputies.
Tell them you're sick.
Are you out of your mind?
You want to get your neck stretched?
_ We're facing it.
_ Not a lynch mob.
We're here because you ran in
New Orleans. We're not running again.
_ Katie's not losing this one.
_ We're the ones who're in trouble!
_ I suppose she wasn't.
_ She's the same as other mothers.
Her kids didn't turn out the right way.
So what of it?
Nobody's making any decisions for me.
I'll make my own.
You can buy her an angel or a lamb, pay her off with a slab of marble.
You can make that decision.
But I'll decide this one.
If we all get killed out of this, nobody's going to run. Katie wins this one.
You're going to Laredo.
Make one wrong move, you'll get the same thing you gave Billy.
Come on!
_ Got the shackles ready?
_ All ready.
_ All right, you two over here.
_ I don't want to be shackled to him!
Kind of late to be choosy about your friends.
Get a leg up.
Make sure they're tight.
Raise your right hands.
Do you swear to act as deputy sheriffs and uphold the laws of Texas?
_ Say, "I do."
_ I do.
Get in that wagon.
Once on the bridge, they're all yours.
_ I don't trust them guards.
_ The drivers are on our side.
They've got their stories straight.
"We were ambushed by the Elder gang."
Whoa!
_ What are you stopping here for?
_ To rest the horses.
_ Ned, whaùs the matter?
_ Resting the horses.
_ All right...
_ Jump!
Put your hands up, Ben.
_ You're wearing a badge.
_ So was Billy. Drop that rifle.
_ One gun won't hold them off very long.
_ Ben's got some guns in that rig.
_ Think you can cover us?
_ Three shots worth.
_ Can you keep underwater with me?
_ If I can't, you just hold me under.
Leùs go. Come on.
I knew you were going to mob those boys.
Sure you did, Ben.
But they had it coming.
Hold it.
Tom! Tom!
Use the horses to get back.
All right. Keep in step or we'll get tangled and go down.
All right, Curley, this is what you were hired for.
I don't want one of them Elders to get out of here alive. Move!
All set?
They've got a hold of Ben's guns.
We'll never get them out of there.
_ I'd like to blast them out of there.
_ There's dynamite in the gun box.
I don't like it.
Too quiet.
Leùs get back.
Cover me.
Go!
Look out!
Matt!
_ John.
_ Let me help you.
No, please, I...
John... I wish...
Maybe Bud...
I... I wish...
Here they come!
I'm hit!
I'm hit. John!
John Elder, throw me a gun.
I'll help you.
_ Ben's going to help them.
_ Stupid fool!
No, Dad. Thaùs Ben!
Come on.
_ Hastings is leaving. Leùs go.
_ Whaùll we tell them in town?
What Hastings said. We were ambushed by the Elder gang. Leùs go!
Leùs get out of here before they come back.
_ We're going back to town.
_ They'll kill us the minute we get there!
_ We ain't going to run.
_ I am!
How? There's one wagon, and Bud needs a doctor. I'm taking him back.
I'll get the buckboard.
Get Bud in the barn.
Hold it, Burr.
Go on home. Get out of here.
Wait a minute, kid. We're going to need a doctor. Go get Doc Isdell.
Go on, Jeb.
Be quick about it.
_ Take off these leg irons. Theirs first.
_ Yes, sir.
_ Where are you going?
_ Doc Isdell's. One of them's hurt.
_ Whaùs your hurry?
_ Pa's in there.
Let him go.
Thaùs it, Harry. Thaùs far enough.
What do you want?
I want you to surrender.
Then I'll let the doctor through.
Get the doctor, or you'll be short of a blacksmith.
_ Do what he says, Harry!
_ Not till we see you out here.
_ Harry!
_ We can't trust him, Will.
We can trust your deputies to shoot us up.
Your gang killed a lot of good men doing their job.
My gang? Then who killed Matt, shot Bud and blew up the bridge?
What about Billy?
How long does it take a man to ride to Pecos, Harry?
Eight, nine hours.
_ When did you last see Billy?
_ We were playing chess at nine.
We can prove we were in Pecos at nine o'clock.
Send for the marshal, Harry.
We'll give ourselves up.
But not to you, or anyone in this town.
You get that US Marshal from Laredo and we'll come out.
_ How will I get a US Marshal here?
_ I don't know.
Telegraph him, or go get him yourself.
But get him.
Go on in, Doc.
Over here.
Out.
One of them's wounded.
I want you men to go home.
Those men are my prisoners the same as if they were in that jail.
The US Marshal will be here. Any man who starts trouble will answer to him.
Now, break it up and go home!
Go on!
I've done about all I can for him now.
You'd best get him over to the boarding house as soon as you can.
_ John.
_ Yeah?
Don't worry about him.
He'll pull through.
We'll see he gets raised right, you and me.
What if the marshal gets here first?
Iùs their word against ours. Who'll take the word of a gunfighter against mine?
What if one of those guards breaks, Pa?
Only a weakling breaks.
They won't talk.
Not in here, you idiot.
Do you want to blow us all up?
Curley smoked in here.
You ain't Curley!
John.
Dave. He never did answer any questions for us.
_ We've got all the answers we'll get.
_ Iùs worth a try.
You're not going! You step one foot outside that door and you're dead.
You're not going.
Did Doc Isdell say anything about changing the?
You make one move and you're dead!
Do as I say.
Back.
Move! Move!
Right! There's one left for you.
Now, move!
Here's a present for you.
Now, get your answers.
I'm going to give you some real good advice, mister.
This is no time for lying.
_ Who ambushed us?
_ I don't know.
_ Answer me. Who killed my brother?
_ I don't know!
Talk! You were there when Ben got it.
_ Who ambushed us?
_ I don't know. I didn't do anything.
When I let you breathe again, you'd better come up with the right answers!
Pa! I didn't tell them.
I wasn't going to talk.
I wasn't going to talk.
Drop that gun, Hastings.
They shot at me. They got my son Dave in there. Get him out!
_ I didn't tell them!
_ Didn't tell them what, Dave?
My father, he killed Ben. He killed him.
And my dad?
Your father found out he was being cheated.
And Billy kept getting closer to the truth.
Billy, too?
John...
...give me that gun.
I represent the law around here now.
We'll take care of Hastings.
I don't want any trouble with you, Harry.
I wouldn't argue with him.
John.
This is something
I have to do myself, Harry.
Get Doc Isdell for Tom.
John.
BuÔs in here.
_ Is he all right?
_ Doc says he'll need lots of care.
_ He'll get it. And Tom?
_ Doc's with him now.
Tom said iùd take more than one bullet to kill him.
He's in here.
Mornin', son.
Mornin'.
We're a little off our course.
There's a played-out mine somewheres around here.
Know of it?
There's a lot of old mines around here.
This one is bein' worked by a fellow name of Sand.
Samuel Sand.
He's my father.
You don't say, boy?
Well, son, your pappy and me, we hunted buffalo together in the army.
We thought it only decent to stop by and say howdy.
About three miles on, the second canyon, you pick up the trail going west.
You'll see the buildings plain.
You have a first name, boy?
Max.
Much obliged, Max.
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Now you keep out of this, squaw!
Now, where is the gold?!
You tell me, where is the gold?!
Take it easy, easy.
Come on, Sam.
Sam... it ain't no use holdin' out.
There ain't no gold, Jesse.
When you gonna get that in your stupid head?
Now, look!
You're working a so-called dead mine but you brought it back to life.
Now, you found something you're sittin' on real cute-like, right?!
Would l be living like this?
You understand, we don't want all of it, just half.
Of nothin'!
Oh, you've been spreadin' gold dust around Owl Creek like snow!
That were a day's work, that's all.
You paid your store bill with a solid gold nugget. l've been working two years-- one nugget, $38.
Wouldn't even pay for the shovels l wore out.
Look, we didn't ride all the way out here to argue.
You're going to tell us where it is, Sam, or you're going to tell us with your dyin' breath!
Now, where is it?!
Whoa, boy, easy...
Well, ain't that right handsome beadwork?
You fashion it yourself, squaw?
Yeah, it's been 1 5 years since l skinned an injun, squaw man!
But l ain't forgot the way.
Please... leave her be. l tell you, there ain't any gold. l swear it, none. l'm not afraid.
Max... they're both dead.
No, there's nothing you can do now.
Max!
Max, stay out of there.
For God's sake, stay out!
Max, come on into town with me.
They don't even look like people anymore.
Their sufferin's over. l don't want anybody to ever see them lookin' like that... ever.
Go away.
Leave me alone, please.
Gid'up.
My... God!
Max, you poor child.
Now, you come live with us.
Now l mean it. l can't.
We've got acres of land and a lifetime of work. l've got to find those three men.
And if you do?
Revenge isn't God's way.
Oh, save your preachin', Ben.
But you're only a boy.
They're hard and vicious men.
Get 'em, Max.
You go get 'em.
Elvira...
Well, why not? lf he doesn't, who will?
The law!
The law-- what law?
Max... at least wait a day, rest up.
Maybe l can catch 'em with that gray horse before they sell it.
Here... here, Max.
Miss McCandles, l got a rifle, a horse and eight dollars. lt'll hold.
Well, then, good luck.
Don't forget the way back. l'll remember you both for your kindness.
Larry!
Who the hell are you?
My name is Max.
Max Sand.
Just a kid. lndian.
Half-breed.
You alone?
Spit it out-- quick! l was following three men who killed my mother and father and l thought you were the ones.
Are we the ones?
No.
How long have you been tracking these killers?
Three, four days.
When did you eat last?
Couple of days ago!
Pick up the horses... and join us.
Hey, kid.
Why don't you go home, huh? l mean, while you still have a chance.
Don't have a home.
Hey, how can you guys be so friendly?
After what l tried to do?
Well, everybody in this world is foolish in his own way.
Besides, we were all kids once ourselves.
Weren't we now?
Don't move, mister!
Now turn around... with your hands up.
Now, all l want is some food and a horse. l haven't seen one of them old guns in years.
Keep away. lt won't work, you know. l said stay back!
Well, the barrel's all rusted up, and the hammer's broke.
And besides, they haven't made ammunition for one of them things in ten years.
You want to trade? l could use something to eat.
You've been through about 25 pounds of food in three days.
You think you're ever going to get filled up?
Oh, l'm sorry. l didn't think. l know it's a long ways to haul food.
Well, finish it up, if you can. l can. l didn't expect you to be so generous.
Think l was going to throw you to the coyotes?
You had every right. l meant to kill you if l had to.
You an old hand at killing? l killed my share of deer and... rabbits.
Ever hold a gun on a man?
No.
You're setting out to kill three of them, huh?
Bang, bang, bang.
You figure you're going to make it
'cause you got right on your side? lt helps.
They bury a sheriff about once a week out here.
Well, l just figure it's a matter of me killing them before they kill me.
Now, you want to show me some of this fancy gun work?
Turn around and face the sun.
Hit that.
Go on home, boy.
Take the shortcut.
The sun was in my eyes, and l wasn't expecting it.
You expect a man's going to hold still for you with the sun at your back, then give you a warning so you can stand there and shoot at him? l can hit a rabbit at 80 yards with a rifle.
A rabbit don't shoot back.
How do you think you're going to swing a rifle in a barroom? l never been in a barroom.
Look, just to find them, you're going to have to comb out every saloon, gambling hall, hog farm and whorehouse between here and Mexico.
What do you think you're after, three preachers?
You going to gun them down at 80 yards when they're coming out of a church social?
You're hunting three men who steal because they're too damn lazy to work and they kill because they love to.
Then they hide out like rats in the garbage.
So if you're going to get them, you're going to have to eat, drink and wallow in that garbage right with them till you get so you think like them and smell like them. l'll do what l have to do. lt ain't that easy, kid.
Finding them is one thing, killing them is another. l'll figure out ways.
Ah.
Well, l've been selling guns and ammunition to men like that for 1 5 years and they got more ways to cripple and kill a man than you ever dreamed about.
They'll shoot you in the back, they'll ambush you-- they'll cut your throat while you're laying asleep.
All you got going on your side is some blind lndian revenge. l'm half-white.
And you're all helpless.
Now, you get so you can do that with either hand-- and you're half-drunk or half-awake, or inside of a dark room off the back of a running horse-- you might stand a chance.
A small chance.
Would you teach me? l sell guns, l don't teach killing.
Then l'll learn myself.
You won't live that long.
Well, thank you for the food and advice, Mr. Cord. l guess l'll be on my way.
Where to? How? What with?
You know, if l did teach you something, that's only half of it.
While you're looking for them three men you gotta live, don't you?
You gotta eat.
You need clothes, food, horses, saddles, guns, ammunition, money.
How are you gonna get that?!
Tracking beaver on Sundays? l'll tell you how you get it.
You'll wind up stealing and killing.
You'll turn yourself into the same kind of animal you're trying to track down.
Can't you see that? l don't see nothin'... except my father laying on a blood-covered floor all burnt and cut with the top of his head blown to pieces.
And my mother... split up the middle and every square inch of her skin ripped off.
Well...
God help us.
Pick up that brass.
Them cartridges cost a cent and a half apiece.
Sit down.
Little poker suit you?
Well, not too much.
You know how to play cards, don't you?
No. l guess l can teach you.
Have a drink.
Well, l...
You don't drink either?
No.
Where you're going, you'd best study up on it.
Now, the lowest hand you can get is a pair-- that's two of a kind.
Then two pair and three of a kind, then a straight.
Three of what kind?
Three of anything-- three nines, three tens, three jacks.
Which ones are the tens?
Don't you know how to read?
Well, l never went to school.
Know how to write?
Well, if l know how to write, l'd know how to read.
Anything you can do?
Reach.
That's an awful waste of good whiskey.
Where you were goin', you wouldn't need whiskey.
All right.
A ten has got ten spots on it.
You can count that far on your toes.
Max...
Listen, you take it easy around here. lt's just a quiet town. l know people, l do business with them.
Well, all right.
But listen, Mr. Cord, if you happen to see...
Yeah, l know, if l see anything suspicious like a horse with an ''SS'' brand, l'll come get you.
Here's a buck-- go buy yourself some candy.
Yes, sir, can l help you today?
Can of peaches.
A big can, please.
Best Eastern peaches in the West.
Would you open it for me?
No charge.
Hey, you got a book that teaches you readin' and writin'?
McGuffey's Primer, right under the stairs.
Hey, uh...
Of course, you can't pick one out until you can read, and you can't read until you can pick one out, can you? lt's this here one.
Or, as McGuffey would say, ''this one here.''
That's 25 cents for the peaches and ten cents for the book.
Funny, isn't it? ldeas don't weigh much, but peaches do and the freight company charges by the weight.
You know, six books, it's... oh, it isn't very important.
Most people are hungrier in their stomachs than they are in their minds anyway.
Well, there's your first decision:
Now, that sign on the top says ''Silver City.''
That's over in Colorado.
And the second one-- the one over there-- that's ''Donner, ''California.
The one on the bottom, see, that says ''Sonora.''
That's down south in Old Mexico. l-l sure can't tell you which way to go, but you want to catch 'em, you best go where the money is. lf they got it, they're going to head for where they can spend it. lf they ain't got it, they'll go where they can steal it.
Mr. Cord, l... l just don't know how l'm ever going to be able to pay you back for all this.
No need to. l tell you what, you get tired of chasing them, you look me up, and we'll talk about it, all right?
Well, no use drawing this out.
Good luck, Max.
Bang, bang.
Yeah...
Very nicely done.
You know, handlin' one of these things is only half of it.
The other part's learning human nature.
That's going to take you the rest of your life, so you damn well better not trust anybody till you do.
Now, you want to plan your moves, pick your place to fight, don't make any threats... and don't you ever walk away from one, you hear?
Good-bye, Max.
Bye, Mr. Cord.
Don't even trust a friend.
Hyah, hyah.
Hyah, hyah.
Hyah, hyah, hyah.
Hyah.
Come on, Struther, you've washed your little, thin body enough.
Look how white l am.
Struther, please hurry up.
Hey, the dames are comin'! Hey!
Hey, the dames are coming!
Struther, you'd better hurry up and get out of there.
They're comin' up here.
Hank!
Red!
Cat got your tongue?
Well, come on.
-Gee, you're cute.
-Wal-Walter.
-Walter? How are you, Walter?
-Howdy... ma'am.
Hey, look at me!
Want to come downstairs and have a drink?
-Hey!
-Shut up.
What's the matter with me?
Whoo!
Hey, don't be backin' off like that.
Hey, hey, one of you...
Well... well...
Hey, l'm in the tub.
Hello, cowboy.
Welcome to town.
Try the next room.
White women more popular.
Well, they saved me for you.
Navajo?
Kiowa. l am Kiowa, too.
Well, yes or no?
Five dollars...
...for some questions. l'm lookin' for three men, they ride together.
And one of them-- the name is Jesse-- got a scar on his neck, carries a knife.
May be riding a gray horse.
You ever seen any people like that?
Lots of men come through here, lots of men with scars.
Buy yourself some moccasins.
Why do you ask for them?
They tortured and killed a woman...
Kiowa, like you.
One man...
...has a... scar here.
He works downstairs dealing cards in the bar.
Oh, but he might not be the same man.
Where does he keep his horse? ln the stable across the street.
But, please, don't tell anyone l told you.
Hey, mister?
Yeah?
That gray for sale? l don't think so.
Belongs to Jack Langley over at the Palace Bar. l don't think he'll sell him, though. l'll open for 20. l'll have to call you. l'll call at 20.
Call.
No more bets.
Jesse.
Any cards, boys?
You!
Dealin' cards.
Jesse who?
''Jesse Coward.''
''Jesse Murderer.''
''Woman killer.''
Now, wait a minute, my name is Jack Langley.
When you killed my mother and father... it was Jesse.
Look, l'm Jack Langley.
Where did all this killin' take place, boy?
Hey, Hudson, what's my name?
Jack Langley.
How long l worked here?
Year, year and a half.
Anything else?
Stand up!
Now look, l'm not armed.
My father wasn't armed when you tied him to a post and blew the top of his head off.
Now, kid, settle... l know what l'm doin'!
He's ridin' my father's horse. l'm ridin' my own horse.
With an ''SS'' brand.
Look, l bought that horse. l have a bill of sale for it in my room.
Fair enough.
Let's see it.
Now look, son... if Langley here did what you said, l'll sit on him and let you kill him.
But if he's got a bill of sale upstairs, you could have the wrong man. lt's happened before.
Let's look.
Come on, both of you.
You fight like your mother, boy.
Should have taken you to a sailmaker to get stitched up.
That McGuffey reader inside your shirt kept that knife away from your stomach.
Kid, the minute you get off that table, you'll move on.
How can he move on?
How can he ride a horse with all them stitches in him?
That's up to him.
Kid, you killed a man-- as you tell it, for good reason.
Now, you did what you had to, and that's what l'm doin'. lf we don't drive you out, there'll be more killin'.
You got any friends?
No.
There's an lndian dance hall girl been askin' about you.
Maybe she can help.
Where...?
How did you get...?
You come back to us in trouble... and in pain.
You are welcome.
How long?
Many days.
You talk in fever of the death of your father, and Tabinaka, my brother's daughter.
You stay here with your own people.
Neesa-- she became shame of Kiowa.
But she bring you home.
That's good.
Maybe both of you make each other well.
You stay here.
Oh, no!
You get right back in there. lt's hot water, and it's good for you.
''See...
''See the frog... on a log.
''Rab sees the frog.
The frog...''
Three weeks, you sit here, you never laugh, you never smile.
''Can the frog see Rab?
Rab can't...''
You learned to read not to make you wise, but to help you find men to kill.
''The frog can see the dog.
Rab ran at...''
Do you think that l became a dance hall girl because l was bad? lt was because l was full of hatred and foolish.
''See the lamp. lt...'' lf there was a medicine that would change the way l was, l would take it.
Do you know of one?
Neesa, it ain't got nothing to do with you.
Honestly, nothing. lf l could find a medicine, l'd take it myself.
Really?
For true.
See... the... lamp? lt... is... out. lt ain't gonna work, Neesa.
Why?
'Cause l'm gonna have to go soon.
When?
One morning l'll be gone.
Make yourself at home.
You... lookin' for anything in particular?
Names, that's all. l'm no thief.
Yeah.
What kind of names?
Friends of Jesse Coe's.
Are you a friend of Jesse Coe's? l'm the one that killed him.
My name is Angie--
Mrs. Coe.
You might call me
''the widow Coe.'' l don't know what to say. l do.
Thank you.
Tell me about the men he rode with.
You know, you look young.
But any man that could take
Jesse Coe with a knife had to be some man.
You know where they are.
Do you know their names?
Well, l think... one of 'em's name is... Bowdre--
Bill Bowdre.
He wanted Jesse to go on a bank job with him down in Louisiana.
And it's really too bad he didn't go.
Why?
'Cause they got caught, put in prison.
There was one other one. l don't know his name.
That's all l can tell you.
Mm...
''Western... gang... robs...''
''Bank... of...
New Orleans.''
''Two...''
''ap...''
Hey, Cap... what's that word?
The word is ''apprehended.''
Well... what does it mean?
Well, it means like caught.
Say anything here about where they were taken?
No.
Fella gets caught robbing a bank down here, and they throw him right into the state prison camp.
Much obliged.
Corbin?
Yeah.
How do you want yours?
Just money.
Sand?
How do you want it? l want all of it, in that bag.
Max...
Shut up!
The big money's in the vault.
Get back!
Stay there.
There's only one this time, Warden.
Two years-- he robbed a bank.
''Two years, hard labor.''
That's the only kind we got here.
Startin' with me, everything in this place is mean and miserable-- the heat, the mosquitoes, the food, the life.
There's nothing to do all day but work, and nothing to do at night but sleep.
We don't have any walls or fences.
The swamp is our wall-- miles and miles of it, filled with dirty water, quicksand, moccasins and malaria.
Any questions?
No.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Just one more thing.
Don't ever make me mad.
Big Foot?
Yes, sir, Warden?
Get him out of here.
Put him in Miller's bunk.
Yes, sir, Warden.
Let's go.
Right over there.
Don't be lookin' at this gun, boy.
They want you to go for it.
Case you're wonderin', l'm a prisoner, just like yourself. l'm a trustee. ln there.
You don't get to keep anything, boy.
Get a blanket, your clothes.
You get a bath and shave once a week.
One razor for the whole barracks.
You take your time.
This is your bunk.
Belonged to a fella named Miller.
He died.
The only way to get out of here, is it?
Oh, they try it all the time, boy, through the swamps.
Dogs are out after two of them right now.
They tried to rob a bank in New Orleans.
Bowdre.
Bowdre and Strayhorn.
They friends of yours?
No... l read in the paper.
Did they make it?
Nobody's made it since l been here, boy.
Let's get over to the blacksmith's shop-- put these leg irons on you.
Something botherin' you, boy?
Yeah.
Let's go!
Big Foot!
Get 'em all out here so they can watch this.
Let's go.
Big Foot!
Now you listen to this:
Strayhorn died in the swamp.
Bowdre here is going to wish he did, too.
When he serves his time, he's going to serve every day of Strayhorn's.
You think about that... hard.
That ain't done here!
A man lies where he falls!
He'll drown!
The warden's watching you, boy.
Back to the mess hall!
Let's move, let's move!
You get right back on in there, boy, and keep the fires goin' till mornin'.
Yeah, well... when do... when do l sleep?
Just don't let the fires go out.
He's really giving it to me, ain't he?
Well, boy, you made yourself a lot of enemies around here.
For what it's worth to you... you made yourself a lot of friends, too.
Thanks for what you did for me.
Ah, you would have done the same thing for me. l don't know.
Maybe l can do something for you someday.
Maybe you can... someday.
Haven't l seen you somewhere before?
Hey, you!
Back to work, no more talkin'. l don't know, maybe.
You ever been in Santa Fe, Max?
Um... no.
Bowdre...
What happened?
What went wrong out there?
We got lost.
Maybe it was Juarez.
Juarez?
Nah, l don't think so.
Didn't you have a plan or nothin'?
Sure, we planned to move fast and not get caught.
What was it like out there? ln the swamp?
Yeah. lt was just what the warden said it was: miles and miles of swamp, quicksand, razorbacks, poison snakes, mosquitoes, everything that kills.
No food, water you couldn't drink.
You just went around in circles.
Ho-ho, l've had all the swamp l want.
Yeah... l'm goin'.
How? l don't know yet.
But what if l find a way? l've had it.
You count me out. l can't-- you're the only man here l'd risk it with.
Nice evening, ain't it?
For people with guns and whips.
Well, now take it easy, fella. l just do my job.
Yeah, and how you love it. l love livin', same as you.
Trouble with this place is you can't even pick your friends.
This is something new.
Where we going?
Didn't they tell you?
Tell me what?
We're going to clear this ground here for new rice paddies.
That's why everyone's so happy. ls that good? ls that good?
They got women there, pal, women.
Lo and behold.
Lo and behold!
Pick out one for yourself.
Give her a great big smile.
Smile?
For what?
Don't you know?
During the planting season, the warden rents us out to these planters.
Course, he keeps the money but we get the women.
Yeah?
How?
One Saturday night a month while we're working here, he lets them come into the barracks.
You mean... they let the women come to the barracks?
Yeah. l didn't believe it myself at first.
And we can talk to them?
Talk to them?
Stop dreaming about women.
Think about a boat.
A boat.
All l can see, feel or think about is woman.
Yeah?
Well, with a boat, there's no struggling in the swamps, there's no snakes, there's no quicksand.
Walking or in a boat, you still have to know which way to go. l thought about that, l thought about that-- and the water and the food and a gun.
But right now, let's start with a boat.
Come on, let's go!
Get to work!
Work! Let's go!
Come with me.
Come on, let's go!
Hurry up!
Hurry up, don't take all day!
What do you suppose is taking them so long to get here?
Maybe the warden changed his mind.
He did and l'll kill him with my bare hands!
How you doing, Max?
They are coming, ain't they?
Let's douse the lights down there.
They'll be here now that the candles are out.
Are you young or old? l'm young.
So am l.
What's your name?
Max.
Mine's Pilar.
What'd you do to wind up in here?
Oh, nothing much.
Did you kill somebody?
No. l'm glad l didn't get one that killed.
Nah, l just tried to steal some money.
For a woman?
No.
You talk different.
You're not from here, are you?
No, l'm from... l'm from the West.
Oh. lt's dry there.
And clean.
You were born here, huh?
Ooh... born here standing knee-deep in water all my life, and l'll likely die here.
Hey, l was thinking, you're a prisoner here, the same as me.
Yeah, but one day they'll let you go.
Well... if you hate it so much, why don't you do something about it?
Do something? What?
Get out.
Escape.
Escape? How? ln a boat... with me.
You interested, Pilar?
Bowdre. l think she's going to help us.
She's showing me a boat. l don't see any boat.
Right over there behind those bushes. See?
What does she want for it?
To go with us.
No. l like women more than anything but not when l'm running.
Oh, yeah. l mean, you got lost, didn't you?
Listen, she was born and raised here.
She knows every inch of these swamps.
We've got to have her.
Yeah... well, how you gonna arrange everything?
And we need a gun. l know, l know.
You boys better get your talking done with.
You ain't gonna have much more time for it.
They're sending
20 men out to another camp next week.
You're on the list, Max.
Here they come!
Here they come!
Hey, here they come!
Here they come!
Here they come!
Here they come!
Pilar?
Listen, Pilar, l have to talk to you.
Let's go outside.
Come on.
Listen, Pilar, they're taking me out of here next week.
They're taking me to a new place.
Maybe they'll take you to a better place, one that's easier to get out of. lt's going to have stone walls and we ain't never going to see each other again. lf we're going to get out of here, it's got to be before that. l don't know. Getting a boat by myself-- that's not easy. lt's the only way. lf we're going to be together, we've got to have a boat.
What happens to me then? l'll take care of you, Pilar.
You bring me the boat, show me the way out of here... l'll make you free... and l'll start you off in life real good.
Just treat me nice, Max.
That's all l want.
You'll be there?
Certain? l'll try.
Trying ain't good enough-- you've got to be there.
Two hours after the sun goes down, you meet me down there at the edge of the swamp.
Bring the boat down there right by that stand of cypress.
Understand?
Let's go back inside, Max, l'm scared.
Pilar... if you're not there... and they catch me, you know what they're going to do to me? l'll be there.
Max?
You'll treat me nice, won't you?
Yes.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
You sure this is the place?
Yeah.
That dirty, filthy, lying Cajun...
There ain't no boat.
There ain't no boat anywheres around!
Shh-- shut up!
The minute Big Foot comes to, they'll be after us.
We should have killed him!
Shh.
Get in.
Oh!
Max!
Something hit me.
Let's go!
Joe.
We don't get him back, you'll serve out his time.
Yes, sir, Warden. lf he kills one of my men with your gun... l'll hang you.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Warden, l'll get him.
Pilar?
Pilar, which way?
Go right. l got to look at it.
Hold that.
Bread? lt's good poultice.
Right!
Bottle.
Could have used swamp water for that.
Pilar.
How do you feel? l don't know. l'm so sleepy.
You just got a fever, that's all.
Max...
We're not going to get out of here, are we?
We're going to get out of here, Pilar.
You just tell me if we're heading right. l'm not sure.
Take a guess.
Best one you can.
Keep that way.
What's wrong with her?
Snakebite.
You can't go by her-- she's out of her mind.
We're lost.
We're all right.
We ain't lost.
We're heading west.
How do you know? l can tell.
The sun.
The sun!
What do you think you are, a lousy lndian or something?
That's right, l'm half lousy lndian, and my mother was an lndian.
Max.
Max Sand. l... l swear l didn't kill them. l had nothing to do with it. l was outside minding the horses. lt was that crazy Jesse Coe.
But... but he paid for it.
Somebody got him.
Me!
Who was with Coe while you were outside?
Fitch-- Tom Fitch.
Two guys l just fell in with. l didn't know what they were like.
Where's Fitch?
California gold fields, the last l heard.
Look... l didn't want to do it. l couldn't help it.
They made me do it with them.
You scared, Bowdre?
Yes, l am.
Like my mother was.
Give me a chance.
Max, don't shoot!
That's all l ask, give me a chance.
Like you blew the top of my father's head off?
You're crazy, you're crazy! l...
That's why you wanted to escape.
So you could kill him.
What do you plan for me?!
What do you suppose they were shooting? l don't know, but they used up five bullets.
They only got one left.
Well, anyhow, if we can't travel in this, they can't either.
They got a boat, man.
Don't you realize that?
Pilar...
Pilar...
There's nothing l can do to help you, unless we get out of this swamp as quick as we can. l don't know where we are.
Cool air from dry land makes fog.
You could be out by tomorrow morning. l'll find a doctor, or somebody, to help you.
You can't stop-- you'll get caught.
Leave me. l couldn't do that,
Pilar. l want you to.
You're a dirty, low animal.
You lied to me.
You used me to kill.
You're worse than the man you killed.
You don't care about me-- you don't care about anybody.
You'd kill me, too, if you had to.
No.
No?!
You have!
You're not going to die, Pilar. l-l promise.
You'd promise anything. l won't let you.
What do you think you are-- God?
Go away.
Pilar...
Go away! l don't want to die in sin, looking at your face. l'm sorry. l'm so sorry.
You've been asking around for a man by the name of Tom Fitch?
Yeah... he's my brother. l heard of him.
You did, huh?
A couple of months ago, give or take a week.
He road through here, up to no good.
Headed north.
How'd he look?
Mean as you, the kind somebody's always looking for. l hope you'll keep on looking.
You do, huh?
Yeah, because then you'll be moving on out of town as soon as your horse gets shod.
You will, won't you?
Most likely.
Most definitely.
Three kings.
Tom Fitch.
Heard about a Joe Fitch, worked in the mine.
300 feet down, still there.
Then there was a Carrot Fitch.
Red hair.
Now, that was back in Fort Wayne.
Nope, Tom Fitch doesn't ring a bell.
Any particular reason why you're tracking him?
Yeah, he's my brother.
Got a message from home.
You'll probably run into him one of these days. l hope so. l'll put the horses in the corral.
You got some coffee?
Yeah.
Why are you staring at that, huh?
Why? You've seen it before.
Pretty fancy.
Made from the dress of an lndian squaw.
Named Sand?
Yeah...
Yeah!
Who would've thought... that a wet-nosed kid would've made a big thing out of it? lt's the lndian in him.
One of the best men with a knife l ever saw was Jesse Coe, and this kid killed him with a knife.
Then he tracks Curly Bill Bowdre all the way to Louisiana, gets himself thrown in prison just to gun him down, and then he escaped.
You really got a bad case of the shakes, Fitch.
The shakes!
Aw, shakes.
The kid's creepy.
He ain't human.
He doesn't kill people; he... he executes them.
Yeah, he executes them.
Hard job, ain't it, killing time? l'm working.
You just can't see it.
Give me a drink.
Hell of a way to begin a day, ain't it?
Well, l ain't crying about it-- why should you? lf ever you could, it would add 20 years to your life-- yeah, maybe somebody else's.
Morning, Buck.
Morning. l thought l told you to get out of town.
Well, l... l didn't know there was any hurry.
Mr. Fitch, this here is a hair-trigger .45 l'm holding.
The slightest jar, and it goes off, by itself.
Makes a hole as big as a cannonball.
Now, turn around and put your hands on the bar.
Put the cuffs on him.
Now, look-- our job's to keep our ears open and our mouths shut.
Well, now that we're here, how are we going to find Fitch?
He'll find us.
Yeah, he was spreading bills all over town. l was the first one to notice something was wrong.
The sheriff nailed him right up there... right here.
Hey, can we have three whiskeys?
Yes, sir.
He wasn't a bad guy, though.
A little hard but kind of interesting.
What was his name?
Er... Fitch--
Tom or Joe Fitch-- something like that. l don't remember.
There you are.
Six bits.
Hey, Fitch.
Fitch.
Hey, Fitch, it's Beckwith!
Are you in there?
Fitch! l'm here.
Well, get ready.
We're getting you out of there.
Hey, that's not Fitch!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah, hyah!
Who the hell are you?
Tom... Tom Fitch.
Try again!
Now who are you?!
Tom Fitch!
Give him some more!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
What is going on here?!
Answer me!
What's going on here?!
Are you trying to kill this man?
Let go of that rope!
Stop before l find out what this is all about!
That is a priest!
Nobody pulls a gun on a priest!
Who says so?
Me! Cipriano says so.
By the Blessed Virgin, l mean it! l believe you.
Let's get out of here.
You've never been in the church before, hmm?
No.
And... what do you think of it?
Oh, l don't know. lt's kind of strange.
Did you ever see Him before?
Yeah, once.
He was on the end of a little silver chain.
He's the Son of God.
He came to Earth to teach men love by example.
Well, he must have missed somebody.
That looks worse than hanging.
You didn't come to supper. l didn't work this afternoon.
You know, Padre... this room is worse than some jails l've been in. ln a way, we're both prisoners here-- myself by choice and you by circumstance.
Son, you will be...
Padre, will you quit calling me ''son''?
My father's dead. l know, Max.
But you'll be here for some weeks.
Use them profitably.
Arguing with you?
You might read. l brought you a book. lt's called the Bible.
Men have been reading it for many centuries.
What's it about?
Oh, everything important.
There's only one thing important to me.
Finding and killing a man, huh?
Primitive, hopeless revenge. l'll settle for that.
Why... when there is another half of you waiting to be discovered?
You also inherited a refined tradition of religion, philosophy and conscience. l don't understand them words.
The difference between right and wrong and knowing when not to do wrong. lf the civilized half of you ever wakes up, Max, and with God's help, you could become a whole man someday.
With God's help, my leg will heal faster than you can say ''Amen,'' and l'll be out of here!
Good night.
Padre?
Come in, come in, Max. l'm... l'm leaving now and l... want to bring back your Bible.
You've had it a long time.
Why don't you keep it, hmm?
Well, l... l remember the things that matter to me.
An eye for an eye.
Which way are you heading? l'm going north.
You look well, healthy, rested, alive, eh?
Quite different from when l first found you.
Sit down a moment.
Well, Padre, l... l want to thank you for what you did for me, and maybe someday l'll be able to pay you back for it.
Max, please, sit down a moment. l would like to show you something.
Take a look at that.
Surely a picture can't hurt you.
That beautiful couple-- that young man and woman-- came all the way from an ancient
European civilization to find a new and promising life in the American West.
On the way, a band of lndians raided their wagons.
They killed and scalped both of them, after indulging in some cursing and pleasures.
Padre...
Two... two of the children were swung by their heels and had their heads crushed.
The third child was saved and grew up alone, wanting only vengeance.
Believe me, Max, it took more courage to refrain from the obvious temptation than to give in to it.
We're different men, Padre.
No.
That was my family, Max. l'm... the only one who survived.
Don't do any more.
Stop while you can.
Save yourself, Max.
Don't... don't say what you will or won't do.
Just remember: when you ride out of here,
God goes with you. l'll keep it in mind.
Hey! Ah!
Whoa, wait a minute!
Hold it!
Hey, that's the guy that was using your name.
You told me he was dead.
Well, we left him for dead.
Hey, you!
Tough guy! l could use somebody like you.
Doing what?
Do you care?
Yeah, l do.
Who are you?
Smith... Nevada Smith.
You look broke. l am.
Suit yourself, but if you're interested in making a lot of money fast, follow me.
Here, you can put your horse in the corral.
Take mine, too, and then come in.
Oh, no, wait!
Wait a minute!
Rudabough, Shotgun, upstairs.
Cipriano, behind the door.
The rest of you, find your spots.
We'll soon find out who he is.
You go in there.
Take that room.
Good.
Come on in!
Come on!
Here, sit down.
Sit down here.
Say...
Smith, tell me... why did you use my name? l heard of you around.
When they picked me up, l grabbed the first name that came into my mind.
Under my own name, l'm wanted.
But now, l didn't know you were around these parts.
You're wanted?
You...
What are you wanted for?
Wanted for what?
Trying to make a living the easy way-- same as you.
Me?
Did you ever see me before?
Not as l recall.
Any family living?
Well, now, why do you want to know?
Wait a minute, now.
Don't get hot under the collar, Smith.
Sometimes when you're running, a family can help, you know.
The last time l remember, l had a mother, a father, two sisters, and one's married.
Now, what kind of setup you got here, Fitch?
We'll get to that.
Tell me, have you ever heard of a Max Sand?
Sand... Sand...
Yeah, l seen some wanted posters on him.
Never run across him, though.
Why? l killed his mother and father.
So?
So he's out to get me.
Part lndian. lf there's anything l can't stomach, is a half-breed.
Of course, l can understand how it happens.
There's nothing in the world like an lndian squaw.
You agree, huh?
One of my best kinds of fun.
Me, too.
Hold it.
Here.
Why don't you use some good tobacco?
What do you think of that pouch, huh?
Never seen anything like it.
Where'd you get it?
Gift.
Sort of a gift.
Well, now, look, Fitch, let's get down to it.
You said you could use a man like me.
For what?
We're going to knock off a gold shipment. l'll give you the details tomorrow.
Until then, why don't you just kind of... relax and get to know the boys, huh?
Okay.
Use one of the rooms upstairs.
See you around.
Max!
Hmm?
Uh, nothing... nothing, l was just talking to the... uh...
They take a quarter of a million dollars worth of gold a month out of there. lt's too big to hit and too well guarded.
They don't know it, but they're digging up our future right now.
Once a month they take a bullion wagon down the road, three miles to the railroad.
Two men on the wagon and 1 2 guards.
We're going to have a dozen men of our own waiting.
Well, if you take it, you ain't gonna be able to go very fast with a wagon full of gold.
We don't.
Right there we put it in our saddlebags and head out in 1 2 different directions, each man on his own.
Equal split?
Naw!
All you can grab.
There won't be much time, but we'll be able to load up enough to last you a few years.
A few of us are liable to get knocked off.
Scare you?
No. l ain't planning on being one of them.
And there'll be more for the rest of us.
Hey, l like you. l like him!
Now, he's got a sense of humor!
Haw!
Black widow, jack of hearts, queen of hearts, deuce of hearts, another black queen...
Give me that bottle!
Now, we're not running any Sunday school.
But nobody... nobody takes another drink from now until we're finished! l don't want any jumpy riders or nervous triggers.
This isn't going to be any cowhand
Saturday night spree, a-howlin' and shooting up the town.
We're going to move in fast, hit hard and run!
Every man for himself!
Do we shoot to kill? ls there any other way?!
Nah.
They move the shipment out at 8:00.
We'll be up at 5:00.
Any questions?
Good night.
Good night.
What are you thinking about? l'm thinking about how l'm going to spend that gold.
Shoot straight. l intend to.
Max!
Hey, Max!
They'll be coming down this road and heading for that pocket.
Now, here's the road, and here's the pocket.
Rudabough, you take three men and spread out on this side.
Keep your horses out of sight.
Beckwith, you take three men and set up a roadblock up here.
And a good one-- nothing gets by.
That means the wagon.
Cipriano, you and two men on this side and l'll go up the road and make sure they don't turn back.
Alone?
Yes, alone!
Well, you don't have to get nasty... l'm giving the orders!
And when they come up to you, shoot fast, aim to kill.
Get the drivers first.
Now, the one chance we have is to do this quick before any help can ride up.
And with the first shot, we all close in from four sides.
Now, any questions?
Now, don't make any mistakes, Max Sand.
Because if they don't get you, l will.
Ben, Henry, go.
Come on.
Look at this, man!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Come on!
Max! Max! Max Sand!
That's me!
Max...
Max... l'm out of ammunition!
Then get out of there!
All right.
All right... l'm coming. l'm coming! l'm coming, Max.
Here...
Now, why my hand?
Why not me?!
Huh?!
'Cause l want to see you beg!
Beg, you...!
Beg!
Beg for what?!
Beg!
Beg like my mother and father begged!
Your mother?
Here!
Here, maybe you'll want this, huh?
Come on...
Come on, get it over with!
Get it over with!
For God's sake, get it over with!
You waited years for this, so get it over with!
Come on!
Over...
Finish me...
Finish...
Finish me!
You haven't got the guts!
You're yellow!
Finish me!
You're just not worth killing.
Finish me.
Finish me!
You're yellow!
You haven't got the guts!
You're yellow!
You're yellow!
You haven't got the guts!
You haven't got the guts!
You're yellow!
You're yellow!
{1415}{1500}# 'Green Leaves Of Summer'
{4939}{5031}General Houston's arrived, gentlemen.|- Refreshments?
{5035}{5105}Thank you, Doc.
{5155}{5247}71 cold, windy, rump-bumping miles...|since yesterday!
{5251}{5365}You wouldn't have it|any other way, Lightfoot.
{5754}{5828}Company, stand to!
{5898}{5942}Attention!
{5946}{6010}As you are.
{6018}{6086}{y:i}¡Don Esparza!|- ¡Mi general!
{6090}{6158}General Houston, may I|order the men to bivouac?
{6162}{6254}The forced marches took it out of them.|- Foot soldiers may.
{6258}{6302}Feed the others, care for their horses...
{6306}{6398}{y:i}...and tell them there'll be|another march within the hour.
{6402}{6422}Yes, sir! Sergeant!
{6426}{6470}Doctor.|- Sam.
{6474}{6517}Dickinson.|- General, sir.
{6521}{6637}General, it ain't none of my business,|but you ain't ate since yesterday.
{6641}{6685}I'll sit it on the table here.
{6689}{6757}Where's Jim Bowie?
{6761}{6895}When certain people ain't ate,|they're meaner than a bobcat!
{6977}{7021}Mr Dickinson...
{7025}{7106}I asked you a question.
{7169}{7213}Where's Jim Bowie?
{7217}{7261}He's indisposed, sir.
{7265}{7333}By God, if you mean drunk,|you say drunk, sir!
{7337}{7405}He's drunk, sir.
{7409}{7453}What's your name?|- James Butler Bonham.
{7457}{7541}In Travis's command, sir.
{7576}{7628}Hm.
{7696}{7784}Neill, you go north with me.
{7792}{7836}Colonel Travis will be in command here.
{7840}{7908}Major, sir.|- Colonel Travis.
{7912}{7980}I'll send the commission through.|- Thank you, General.
{7984}{8100}Let me assure you I'll do...|- We'll dispense with the amenities. Now...
{8104}{8172}I've been given command|of the armies of Texas.
{8176}{8268}But the fly in the buttermilk is|there ain't no armies in Texas!
{8272}{8340}A few good friends and some willing men.
{8344}{8412}I'm gonna have to knock|some of those men into an army...
{8416}{8460}{y:i}...and to do that I need time.
{8464}{8579}You people right here on the real ground|are gonna have to buy me that time.
{8583}{8651}You have to keep Santa Anna|off the back of my neck...
{8655}{8747}...until I can get in shape to fight him.|- So you're ordering me to...
{8751}{8843}Dammit! I am ordering you to command!|How and what you do is your problem!
{8847}{8915}But, Sam, what about Jim Bowie?
{8919}{8987}Jim Bowie, as Mr Bonham|has informed us, is indisposed.
{8991}{9059}Yes, sir. But I'd like to point out...
{9063}{9131}{y:i}...that Jim Bowie is leading|a hundred volunteers...
{9135}{9227}...whereas young Travis here|commands less than 30 regulars.
{9279}{9347}General Houston, I think|we oughta discuss this...
{9351}{9467}Clear the room! Gentlemen, I would have|a word with Mr Travis if you'll excuse us.
{9471}{9536}Con permiso.
{9782}{9898}Mr Travis, were you going to|complain to me about Jim Bowie?
{9902}{9946}Not complain, sir.
{9950}{9994}Of course Jim Bowie's drunk.
{9998}{10090}He took this town from General Cos.|He fought a battle.
{10094}{10138}And now he's drunk.
{10142}{10227}Seems kinda natural to me.
{10238}{10330}Or perhaps you question something|other than Bowie's drinking.
{10334}{10426}Are you gonna tell me that he's got|a lot of acreage around here?
{10430}{10474}That he's married into|the Mexican aristocracy?
{10478}{10521}Yes, sir.
{10525}{10569}I would trust Jim Bowie with my life.
{10573}{10641}More than that, I would trust him|with the lives of my family.
{10645}{10737}And more than that, I would trust him|with the life of Texas.
{10741}{10785}Sir.|- That's all, Travis.
{10789}{10847}Travis!
{10933}{11001}I've never been able to like you.
{11005}{11121}But you are another one of the very few|men I would trust with the life of Texas.
{11125}{11169}For that, thank you, sir.
{11173}{11241}And it may very well be...
{11245}{11361}{y:i}...that that life rests in your hands now.
{11916}{11960}Jethro! Is that you?
{11964}{12008}Yes, sir, General. This is me.
{12012}{12056}How are you still alive?
{12060}{12152}You had white hair when I was a boy|and now we look the same age.
{12156}{12200}Yes, sir.
{12204}{12320}But I've been a temperate and|God-fearing man all my life, sir.
{12324}{12414}Well, I guess my past is out!
{12420}{12511}Jethro, you tell your Mr Jim|I'm sorry to hear about his illness.
{12515}{12559}I wish him a speedy recovery.
{12563}{12631}And assure him of my undying affection.
{12635}{12655}Yes, sir.
{12659}{12727}And, General Sam, sir, he love you too.
{12731}{12823}And them words of yours|gonna put him right back on his feet.
{12827}{12871}He got a colic, you know.|- I heard.
{12875}{12919}In the stomach.
{12923}{12967}Stay temperate, old man!
{12971}{12991}Neill!
{12995}{13039}Column right! Forward!
{13043}{13100}Yo-ho!
{13139}{13209}Take care, men!
{14434}{14514}You all right, Mr Jim?
{14529}{14573}Yeah.
{14577}{14647}Sit down, Jeth.
{14817}{14871}Ohh!
{14889}{14933}Can I get you something, sir?|- No, no.
{14937}{15012}You just sit there.
{15201}{15269}Houston's gone?
{15273}{15334}Yes, sir.
{15393}{15488}Come and gone and me lying drunk.
{15704}{15804}Colonel Travis! Bowie's approaching!
{16184}{16239}Halt!
{16256}{16328}Carry on, sentry!
{16400}{16444}Recall work parties!
{16448}{16533}Prepare for flag ceremony!
{16591}{16675}Detail! Forward... march!
{17311}{17382}Present... arms!
{17550}{17618}Order... arms!
{17646}{17714}We stand here ready to do our duty...
{17718}{17810}{y:i}...and cognisant of the will of God.
{17814}{17858}Captain Dickinson!
{17862}{17906}Dismiss the ceremony!
{17910}{18026}And, Captain, inform the men that|work details will be dismissed at 4.30...
{18030}{18146}{y:i}...in order that family men may gather|their dependants within these walls.
{18150}{18211}Yes, sir!
{18366}{18410}Lieutenant Blake!|- Yes, sir!
{18414}{18482}You will see to the quartering|of Bowie's volunteers.
{18486}{18505}Yes, sir!
{18509}{18590}You men will follow me!
{18725}{18793}Jeth, Blake'll show you|to our quarters. Set 'em up.
{18797}{18858}Yes, sir.
{19469}{19536}Colonel Bowie.
{19540}{19643}Santa Anna's got an army of 7,000 men.
{19708}{19752}So?
{19756}{19848}Well, you ain't gonna try to defend|this broken-down church...
{19852}{19920}...against 7,000 battle-hard troops?
{19924}{19968}Colonel Bowie.
{19972}{20040}You were drunk at the last officers' call.
{20044}{20136}And I would rather postpone|our discussion until the next.
{20140}{20208}At which time I will explain my plans...
{20212}{20346}{y:i}...and give orders for|the implementing of those plans.
{20931}{20951}Hey, Jim!
{20955}{21023}Why do we have to work like this?
{21027}{21095}I volunteered to fight, not to build no fort.
{21099}{21143}How come we have to work like this?
{21147}{21215}Because old Sam told Travis,|Travis told me...
{21219}{21287}{y:i}...and I'm telling you!
{21291}{21437}Somebody's comin' hellbent for leather,|sinking spurs at every jump!
{21459}{21514}Halt!
{21554}{21598}Corporal of the guard!
{21602}{21666}Post No. 1!
{21674}{21766}No civilians may enter the fort,|Señor Seguin. I'm sorry.
{21770}{21838}Juan! Silverio!|Let 'em through, Dick!
{21842}{21886}Captain Dickinson!
{21890}{21910}Yes, sir.
{21914}{22006}Come to my office, please, Captain.|- Yes, sir.
{22010}{22100}Tengo noticias de Santa Anna.
{22154}{22246}Good afternoon, Colonel Travis.|We have news of Santa Anna.
{22250}{22318}My son and I have...|- Good day, Señor Seguin.
{22322}{22438}Señor, even though you're|the alcalde of San Antonio de Bexar...
{22442}{22509}{y:i}...it does not exempt you|from military prohibitions.
{22513}{22581}This establishment is closed to all civilians!
{22585}{22653}I'm very sorry, Colonel Travis.
{22657}{22725}Had I known your restrictions|applied to me and my family, sir...
{22729}{22821}Now, wait a minute, Travis!|The Seguins have news of Santa Anna.
{22825}{22893}We have a dozen rumours a day.|- You can't just...
{22897}{22965}Por favor, Juan, tell him.
{22969}{23013}Colonel, the Indians of San Blas...
{23017}{23133}{y:i}...sent couriers to the vaqueros of|my properties along the Sangre de Cristo.
{23137}{23205}They say many soldiers crossed|the Baja Diablo two days ago.
{23209}{23277}That puts 'em a lot closer than you thought.
{23281}{23373}The Indians guessed the number|of troops at over 5,000.
{23377}{23493}There are also large numbers of|mounted soldiers and supply trains.
{23497}{23588}Also, lower down on the Baja Diablo|another party of Indians saw signs...
{23592}{23684}{y:i}...of shod horses crossing a ford.|- I'm sorry, Señor Seguin.
{23688}{23780}As a civilian, you cannot realise|how worthless this information is.
{23784}{23828}'Some Indian told some vaqueros...'
{23832}{23900}Anyway, thank you, sir. Good day.
{23904}{23972}You know the Seguins|are absolutely reliable!
{23976}{24044}If you'll excuse me.|- I meant no personal offence, señor.
{24048}{24140}But I cannot make a plan|based on third-hand rumours.
{24144}{24236}I do not take personal affront,|Colonel Travis...
{24240}{24356}{y:i}...else I should be forced to act|other than to simply bid you good day.
{24360}{24438}Adiós, Juan.|- Adiós.
{24671}{24758}You're a damn fool, Travis.
{25702}{25786}A true gentleman, Seguin.
{25822}{25910}I dislike being rude to him.
{25966}{26010}Even allowing for exaggeration...
{26014}{26106}...Santa Anna must have|crossed the Baja in strength.
{26110}{26178}But I had to do it, Dick.
{26182}{26322}I'd say we have two or at best|three days before we see his banners.
{26326}{26370}The men were listening.
{26374}{26533}And I can't let that rabble know how weak|we are and how strong the enemy is.
{26565}{26657}You couldn't do that, eh?|- No, I couldn't.
{26661}{26753}My honest and truthful|and plain-spoken friend.
{26757}{26825}{y:i}You could, perhaps, but I couldn't.
{26829}{26873}Now, take a look at this.
{26877}{26921}This oblique rampart here...
{26925}{27041}Well, have sense, Dick! Why should|those men stay if they knew the truth?
{27045}{27089}It's different for Bowie, of course.
{27093}{27185}He's got a big stake in Texas.|A couple of million acres, I hear.
{27189}{27281}Some of those men haven't got...|- Have you got any dollars or acres?
{27285}{27403}I've got an extra suit of clothes.|You know that.
{27620}{27664}Boy! So that's it!
{27668}{27712}San Antonio de Bexar.
{27716}{27784}It means Saint Anthony in English.
{27788}{27889}The colonel speaks Spanish, you know.
{28004}{28086}Are you gonna pray, sir?
{28100}{28144}But why, sir?
{28148}{28240}I mean, there wasn't|no doubt we'd find her.
{28244}{28360}The colonel just wasn't sure which one|of these here creeks was the shortest cut.
{28364}{28432}He ain't been here in nigh 15 years.
{28436}{28480}Better make the signal, boy.
{28484}{28527}Yes, sir.
{28531}{28575}I hope this powder ain't damp.
{28579}{28671}You don't take it wrong|I ask you all these questions, Parson?
{28675}{28743}No, boy, that's how you learn. Asking.
{28747}{28791}Yes, sir.
{28795}{28911}So many times every day|you stop and give thanks.
{28915}{29007}Mostly I can't catch on to what|you're thanking the Lord for.
{29011}{29055}I mean, there's nothin' special.
{29059}{29103}I give thanks for the time and the place.
{29107}{29175}The time and place, Parson?
{29179}{29271}A time to live and a place to die.|That's all any man gets.
{29275}{29319}No more, no less.
{29323}{29418}Fire the signal, boy.|- Yes, sir.
{29706}{29793}Must be Parson and the boy!
{29826}{29887}Think so!
{30953}{31021}Well, there she be, Colonel!
{31025}{31069}After 20 days of hard ridin'!
{31073}{31141}We gonna have to learn|the lingo they use down here, Davy?
{31145}{31237}Where do we go, Davy?|To the town or to the fort?
{31241}{31285}There's no fort. It's an old mission.
{31289}{31405}You better take a better look.|A lot of people movin' in there.
{31409}{31477}Them guns don't give it|no mission look to me.
{31481}{31524}Colonel...
{31528}{31616}What do C-A-N-T-I-N-A spell?
{31648}{31740}Cantina. Do it mean what I think it do?|- It do.
{31744}{31870}It means out of these deerskins|and into our foofaraw!
{32200}{32278}Hey, you got my coat!
{32583}{32603}Hey, Pedro!
{32607}{32651}Hand me down that guitar.
{32655}{32747}Now I want you folks to all|clump in here close together.
{32751}{32819}I want you Texicans to open up your ears...
{32823}{32937}{y:i}...and listen to a little pure Tennessee.
{32943}{32987}# Here's to the ladies...
{32991}{33035}# I love 'em all...
{33039}{33131}# Here's to the ones I recall...
{33135}{33179}# Here's to the ladies...
{33183}{33227}# Married or free...
{33231}{33299}# They all look pretty good to me...
{33303}{33347}# The big and small ones...
{33351}{33395}# The short and tall ones...
{33399}{33443}# Each one a lovely...
{33447}{33502}Halt!
{33542}{33562}# Here's to the ladies...
{33566}{33634}# I love the ladies...
{33638}{33706}Captain Dickinson, split your patrol.
{33710}{33802}Send half each way down the river for|about five miles to look for any signs.
{33806}{33874}Then report back to the mission.|- Yes, sir.
{33878}{33948}Forward! Yo-ho!
{34645}{34689}Sorry, sir!
{34693}{34771}She sorta come loose!
{34813}{34877}I'd like...
{34885}{34977}I'd like to speak to David Crockett.|- You did.
{34981}{35049}That was David Crockett from Tennessee?
{35053}{35145}Yes, sir. And I oughta know.|Me and him's neighbours back home.
{35149}{35217}Only live 40 mile apart.
{35221}{35288}Colonel Davy!
{35437}{35504}Are you David Crockett, sir?|- That's my name.
{35508}{35576}I'm Colonel Travis,|commanding the garrison.
{35580}{35600}I figured.
{35604}{35711}Well, son, you'd better start growing up.
{35772}{35840}I'd like to speak to you|on a matter of gravest importance.
{35844}{35929}Sure. Let's find a corner.
{35988}{36063}Talking's dry work!
{36204}{36282}You're learnin' fast!
{36348}{36392}Colonel!
{36396}{36440}I'm resignin' from you.
{36444}{36535}I'm gonna marry up with Conchita|and be the man of this house.
{36539}{36583}Bésame a kiss, señorita.
{36587}{36655}I toss around a mess|of that proud Spanish, too.
{36659}{36703}Most important part.
{36707}{36797}Let's jig a little, mamacita.
{36827}{36895}Light there and rest easy, Travis...
{36899}{36967}...while I bed down this buck.
{36971}{37074}He just ain't got no head for whiskey!
{37091}{37135}Parson!|- Yeah, Davy!
{37139}{37224}Take him away.|- Yes, sir!
{37355}{37423}Let's wet our whistles.
{37427}{37471}Words are dusty.
{37475}{37542}I don't drink.
{37546}{37614}Not ever?|- No.
{37618}{37686}I've heard of such.
{37690}{37734}Well, spread your wampum, Travis.
{37738}{37782}My title is colonel.
{37786}{37854}Me, I'm a colonel, too.
{37858}{37926}Wouldn't it sound kinda silly,|chattering colonel, colonel...
{37930}{37998}{y:i}...like a couple of marsh shield birds?
{38002}{38070}Just speak right up and call me Crockett.
{38074}{38118}Don't bother to use my title.
{38122}{38238}Old drunken General Flatford gave it|to me in the Choctaw Indian War.
{38242}{38320}I'll call you Travis.
{38410}{38478}Very well, Crockett.
{38482}{38573}I'd like your permission|to make a speech to your men.
{38577}{38669}Well, they've heard many a speech|while I was congressifying.
{38673}{38717}What would you talk about?
{38721}{38811}Oh, about freedom... liberty.
{38817}{38885}Well, they don't need any such speech.
{38889}{38957}These men are from Tennessee.
{38961}{39101}I'd like to explain why I want them|to volunteer to fight against Santa Anna.
{39105}{39157}Oh?
{39225}{39293}Not so careless!
{39297}{39418}You can't get new clothes|this side of Nacogdoches.
{39441}{39495}Tag!
{39560}{39652}Tennesseans ain't exactly against fighting...
{39656}{39772}{y:i}...but they ain't much for listening|to speeches. What would you tell them?
{39776}{39868}Of the many and unendurable hardships|the people have been subjected to...
{39872}{39988}...under the tyrannical government|of this military dictator Santa Anna.
{39992}{40060}We have no rights in the courts,|no market for our produce.
{40064}{40156}He has forbidden trade with the North.
{40160}{40204}Davy!
{40208}{40276}I want a chance for my money back.
{40280}{40372}Why don't you leave Davy alone?|He done beat you 38 times hand-runnin'!
{40519}{40587}This'll only take a minute, Travis.
{40591}{40659}Give me them feathers.
{40663}{40725}Gentlemen.
{40783}{40863}Balance your feathers.
{40903}{40968}Get set! Go!
{41455}{41570}Gotcha that time, Davy.|- It was fair and square.
{41574}{41666}If we can continue, I would like to say...|- One minute, Travis.
{41670}{41714}That was just for who gets first chance.
{41718}{41822}Prepare yourself, Davy.|- I'm prepared.
{41838}{41906}He's still on his feet!
{41910}{41930}Oh, no!
{41934}{42002}Oh, yes!|- Oh, yes!
{42006}{42078}And it's my turn!
{42294}{42410}He'll never learn!|Let's get a bucket of water.
{42414}{42482}Kind of a game the boys play|back in Tennessee.
{42486}{42577}Even though time is running out,|I must postpone this interview...
{42581}{42649}...until we can be assured|of no interruptions.
{42653}{42819}Step down off your high horse, mister.|You don't get lard less'n you boil the hog.
{42893}{42961}Have one of these cigars.
{42965}{43075}I brought 'em all the way from New Orleans.
{43085}{43153}Were you going to tell my Tennesseans...
{43157}{43201}{y:i}...that a good many men...
{43205}{43249}...sound men all...
{43253}{43345}{y:i}...had a plot to ease the suffering|of the people in these parts?
{43349}{43441}Or were you going to tell them|that Steve Austin, Houston and others...
{43445}{43584}{y:i}...and you too, Travis, had planned|to declare for a republic?
{43588}{43656}To declare this the Republic of Texas?
{43660}{43761}Were you gonna tell 'em that, Travis?
{43780}{43848}I hadn't thought this was generally known.
{43852}{43896}It isn't yet.
{43900}{44016}Not till Austin separates|the sheep from the goats.
{44020}{44112}Not till he decides who's on the right side.
{44116}{44160}Republic.
{44164}{44208}I like the sound of the word.
{44212}{44280}It means people can live free...
{44284}{44328}{y:i}...talk free...
{44332}{44376}{y:i}...go or come, buy or sell...
{44380}{44448}{y:i}...be drunk or sober.|However they choose.
{44452}{44519}Some words give you a feeling.
{44523}{44591}Republic is one of those words that...
{44595}{44663}...makes me tight in the throat.
{44667}{44735}Same tightness a man gets when his...
{44739}{44807}{y:i}...baby takes his first step or...
{44811}{44879}{y:i}...his first baby shaves...
{44883}{44975}{y:i}...and makes his first sound like a man.
{44979}{45115}Some words can give you a feeling|that makes your heart warm.
{45123}{45216}Republic is one of those words.
{45363}{45424}Crockett!
{45483}{45550}I have, I believe, learned|two things about you.
{45554}{45598}Worthwhile, I hope.
{45602}{45718}You're not the illiterate country bumpkin|you would have people believe.
{45722}{45814}You speak an excellent and|concise English when you wish.
{45818}{45862}The... uh... bad grammar is a pose.
{45866}{46030}A fella has to do a lot to get elected to|Congress. I've kissed many a baby, too.
{46034}{46150}The other is that you came|to Texas to fight with us.
{46154}{46222}Don't tell my Tennesseans that.
{46226}{46342}They think we came south|to hunt and... get drunk.
{46346}{46413}Whoo-hoo-hoo!
{46442}{46555}They... uh... seem|to have accomplished that.
{49319}{49411}Good evening, my almost-vanishing lady.
{49415}{49483}Puedes irte, Juan.|- Sí, Señor Sand.
{49487}{49530}{y:i}Trae el equipaje.
{49534}{49602}Incredible! I arranged for this carriage...
{49606}{49674}I would be heartbroken|if you left Bexar just now.
{49678}{49746}Even more so if you left|with my team of horses...
{49750}{49818}...which would bring|a pretty penny in these times...
{49822}{49949}{y:i}...with two factions|buying anything on four legs.
{50326}{50370}Do you have business here?
{50374}{50418}I promised Mother.
{50422}{50466}Your mother?
{50470}{50537}Pray to the North Star.|Ten minutes every night.
{50541}{50635}A long line of star-worshippers.
{50661}{50729}It keeps the rheumatiz away.
{50733}{50801}It seems to me you're looking for trouble.
{50805}{50862}It do?
{50949}{51041}Let's go upstairs. Unless you prefer|discussing your business...
{51045}{51113}{y:i}...in front of every drunken loafer in Bexar.
{51117}{51184}Ándala, pues!
{51453}{51496}I suppose that overdressed ignoramus...
{51500}{51568}{y:i}...is one of the riffraff|here to resist Santa Anna.
{51572}{51688}They'll find graves and nothing else.|Santa Anna will sweep across...
{51692}{51760}Overdressed?|I paid good money for these clothes.
{51764}{51818}Why?
{52052}{52122}Lady's luggage.
{52388}{52432}Gratuity for the boy. You forgot.
{52436}{52494}Dinero.
{52747}{52847}Son, I guess he isn't gonna tip you.
{53155}{53199}Another thing I promised Mother.
{53203}{53319}Never to get in situations|where people pointed guns at me.
{53323}{53367}Ma'am, it is possible that I am mistaken...
{53371}{53463}{y:i}...but it seems to me you find this|gentleman's company distasteful.
{53467}{53510}Tell him to get out.
{53514}{53606}Thank you, sir, but there is no way|in which you could be of help.
{53610}{53734}And I am in no danger.|- I bid you good night, ma'am.
{53778}{53856}Gratuity for the boy.
{54018}{54093}Your property, sir.
{54186}{54261}Muchísimas gracias!
{54737}{54829}We are guaranteed the protection|of the generalissimo himself.
{54833}{54901}Ah, but please don't misunderstand me.
{54905}{54949}{y:i}I don't want all of your lands.
{54953}{55021}Half will be sufficient for me.|I'm no glutton.
{55025}{55117}{y:i}¡Tú eres el más digno|descendiente de la liga de fuerzas!
{55121}{55165}{y:i}¡El más bajo de los cobardes!
{55169}{55237}{y:i}¿Pero cómo es posible que|tengas tan poca dignidad?
{55241}{55309}{y:i}¿Cómo es posible que tengas|tan poca vergüenza?
{55313}{55429}Easy, Graciela, easy! I speak your|language, but that's too fast for me.
{55433}{55524}Though I dare say|I'm better off not understanding.
{55528}{55572}You actually wanted me to agree to this?
{55576}{55644}This atrocity?!
{55648}{55716}I actually did and I actually do.
{55720}{55812}You're an educated woman, Graciela.|Intelligent.
{55816}{55884}Is there any other way|to restore your family properties?
{55888}{55993}Santa Anna's administrators rule Potosí.
{56008}{56052}You... you expect me to marry you...
{56056}{56196}{y:i}...with my father and four brothers newly|buried in Potosí... and my husband?
{56200}{56268}I expect it because it is the logical course.
{56272}{56316}To marry you? Logical?!
{56320}{56364}Of course!
{56368}{56412}I am acceptable to Santa Anna.
{56416}{56531}If he should be defeated, I will manage|to become acceptable to his successors.
{56535}{56579}Oh...
{56583}{56699}That's the trick. To be acceptable|to the powers that be.
{56703}{56771}Let's not pretend|you're a broken-hearted widow.
{56775}{56819}You barely knew the man.
{56823}{56915}The marriage was as much arranged|as this one would be.
{56919}{57011}Your family picked him up.|- That's the way of my people.
{57015}{57035}You'll say yes.
{57039}{57129}It's your only possible path.
{57135}{57203}Like all women,|you'll postpone the decision.
{57207}{57285}But you will say yes.
{58334}{58426}Forgive me, ma'am, but I was|having a smoke out on that gallery...
{58430}{58521}{y:i}...and I couldn't help but overhear...|I wasn't eavesdropping.
{58525}{58665}But it rankles me when somebody tries|to force somebody to do something.
{58669}{58785}You haven't seen me before tonight,|but I am offering you my services.
{58789}{58857}If that fella's making you stay in Bexar...
{58861}{58929}{y:i}...I'm ready, willing and able|to provide you...
{58933}{58977}{y:i}...a transport to wherever you wanna go.
{58981}{59073}And on the other hand,|if you choose to stay in Bexar...
{59077}{59223}{y:i}...I'm ready, willing and able|to see that he don't bother you.
{59245}{59361}Would you answer one question with|complete honesty, Mr... Tall American?
{59365}{59433}Ma'am, only modesty|restrains me from telling you...
{59437}{59552}{y:i}...that I am widely known|for my truthfulness.
{59556}{59696}Would you so quickly offer to defend me|if I were 60 years old and wrinkled?
{59700}{59768}Or is it because I am young and a widow...
{59772}{59898}{y:i}...and you are far from home|and your loved ones?
{59964}{60051}But thank you, anyway, sir.
{60084}{60128}In any event...
{60132}{60248}{y:i}...this is a matter in which|no outsider could help.
{60252}{60320}Mr Tall American!
{60324}{60440}I do believe that a woman in trouble,|even though 60 and wrinkled...
{60444}{60535}...could turn to you for help.
{60539}{60613}Good night, ma'am.
{61307}{61369}¡Adelante!
{62266}{62318}Ha!
{62482}{62525}Well, thanks, friend!
{62529}{62621}If you don't insist on having them|to yourself, I'll give you a hand.
{62625}{62697}Pleasure, friend.
{62721}{62813}You must be Jim Bowie.|The size and the shape is as described...
{62817}{62885}{y:i}...and this knife is certainly|everything I heard it was.
{62889}{62957}I'm Bowie.|- I'm Davy Crockett.
{62961}{63029}Well! I've heard a lot about you!
{63033}{63101}I've heard a lot about you, too.
{63105}{63149}I'd admire to buy you a drink,|or eight or ten.
{63153}{63224}Oh... Excuse me.
{63249}{63317}Did you have some trouble with Emil Sand?
{63321}{63365}Who's Emil Sand?|- Merchant.
{63369}{63437}Tall fella? Butter-coloured hair?|- That's him.
{63441}{63508}I've had some words with him.|Intend to have some more.
{63512}{63580}How about that drink?|- Honoured, Congressman Crockett!
{63584}{63727}Please, Jim! Don't call me that!|I've been trying to live it down.
{64136}{64204}Here's your extra coat, Davy. And a jug.
{64208}{64276}Thoughtful. You'd better|get some sleep, Smitty.
{64280}{64324}I'm not tired.
{64328}{64372}It's Mexico. Exciting night.
{64376}{64444}Yeah, well, you'd still better get some sleep.
{64448}{64515}All right, Davy.
{64519}{64539}Night, Smitty.
{64543}{64638}Good night, Colonel Bowie... Jim.
{64735}{64803}Took a long time for|this night to get unexciting.
{64807}{64872}It sure did.
{64879}{64947}'Tis a mighty pretty one though.
{64951}{65043}I understand you moved down here|lock, stock, and barrel, Jim.
{65047}{65163}I didn't plan on moving.|Came for a visit and stayed.
{65167}{65259}I gather you like it.|- Oh, Davy! If you only knew Mexico!
{65263}{65307}It's wonderful!
{65311}{65403}I thought she was a burnt-over|desert most of the time.
{65407}{65498}Nah... Most northerners|think that. It ain't so.
{65502}{65570}Big valleys between high mountains.
{65574}{65666}Just everything a man could want|in the way of country.
{65670}{65774}For looking at or... or for growing on.
{65790}{65834}But mostly...
{65838}{65906}Mostly it's the people, Davy.
{65910}{65974}They got...
{65982}{66026}This is kinda hard to explain, but...
{66030}{66122}{y:i}...they got courage and they got dignity.
{66126}{66194}They ain't afraid to die.
{66198}{66314}What seems most important to me|is that they ain't afraid to live.
{66318}{66458}Today is important to them,|not the dollar tomorrow might bring.
{66462}{66529}I suppose the Yankee says that's lazy.
{66533}{66626}Me? I say it's a way of livin'.
{66653}{66697}And the womenfolk!
{66701}{66745}Well, Davy...
{66749}{66817}I figured you favoured the Mexican ladies.
{66821}{66889}They tell me you married one.
{66893}{66937}Yeah, I... uh...
{66941}{66998}I did.
{67013}{67075}I... uh...
{67085}{67129}Well, Davy, I...
{67133}{67297}I just ain't got, you know, your way|of putting things into... into words, but...
{67301}{67378}I got a fine family.
{67397}{67441}A wonderful wife and...
{67445}{67525}{y:i}...two fine boys.
{67540}{67632}I guess I'm what you'd call a lucky man.
{67636}{67728}Now, that ain't a bad stab|at putting it into words.
{67732}{67891}I, uh, sent them up to Coahuila with|all the trouble around here, you know...
{67948}{68016}May I speak privately with you, sir?|- Sure, but...
{68020}{68088}Aren't you Señora de López?|- Señor Bowie, I'm sorry.
{68092}{68184}I did not recognise you.|- This place ain't fit for...
{68188}{68232}I know. But the matter is urgent.
{68236}{68304}Could I have a few private words|with this gentleman?
{68308}{68352}Sure. Excuse me.
{68356}{68400}I'll be inside, Crockett.
{68404}{68465}Crockett?
{68476}{68519}You are the famous David Crockett?
{68523}{68567}Well, I'm Crockett.
{68571}{68687}They named me Davy after an uncle|that didn't leave Pa the farm after all.
{68691}{68831}Mr Crockett, shortly after you left my|room I heard an altercation in the street.
{68835}{68927}I could hear the sound,|though I could not see from my window.
{68931}{68975}It sounded like a drunken brawl.
{68979}{69047}Well, sittin' right here I didn't hear a thing.
{69051}{69143}Well, anyway, I saw lights|in the old church...
{69147}{69215}{y:i}...and people moving about.|And one of them was Emil.
{69219}{69263}And... a thought came to me.
{69267}{69335}As you may know,|Colonel Travis has ordered...
{69339}{69431}{y:i}...all powder and ball|from the merchants of Bexar.
{69435}{69502}And he didn't find any at Emil's warehouse.
{69506}{69646}It's my opinion... it's all hidden|in the basement of that church.
{69650}{69694}And... Mr Crockett...
{69698}{69814}The defenders of Texas are going to|need that powder against Santa Anna.
{69818}{69910}And you're against Santa Anna?|- Bitterly. Of course.
{69914}{69958}And this... uh... Emil? He's for him?
{69962}{70006}Yes, he is.
{70010}{70078}Then, how did he figure you'd marry him?
{70082}{70150}Political arguments|don't flavour folks' supper.
{70154}{70270}Nevertheless, I am going to marry him.|Please let's not discuss it, Mr Crockett.
{70274}{70342}The name is Davy,|and I couldn't sleep nights...
{70346}{70414}Will you say goodbye for me to Mr Bowie?
{70418}{70462}Well, I...|- I can make my own way...
{70466}{70580}{y:i}...and I hope the information is helpful.
{70945}{70989}Something interesting, Jim.
{70993}{71109}Parson, round up a couple of the men,|fairly sober, and meet us out in the street.
{71113}{71181}Where are we goin'?
{71185}{71269}The church.|- Yeah, Davy.
{71449}{71493}Hey!
{71497}{71555}Parson!
{71568}{71684}Why'd you run off without me?|- I told him to stay behind. He's drunk.
{71688}{71756}Stick to the point.|Why'd you run off without me?
{71760}{71804}Jim, this is Beekeeper. Jim Bowie.
{71808}{71852}Hi.|- You can come along.
{71856}{71996}But hold your breath. Can they smell,|they'll be warned you're coming.
{72000}{72062}Excuse me.
{72527}{72609}Grab that torch.|- Yeah.
{72815}{72877}Excuse me.
{73510}{73554}Well! Here, Parson.
{73558}{73619}Yes, sir.
{73774}{73862}Rifles.|- Must be 50 of 'em!
{73918}{73962}Pólvora.|- That's gunpowder.
{73966}{74034}Let me take a look at that stuff.|- Watch it!
{74038}{74143}Stand back and stand still.|- Excuse me.
{74158}{74226}There must be a ton of it.
{74230}{74322}I'm sure gonna be looking forward|to seeing that soldier boy's face...
{74326}{74417}{y:i}...when we bring this in.
{76939}{77007}It's a beautiful morning, Davy Crockett.
{77011}{77078}It is that...
{77083}{77127}...María de López y Vejar.
{77131}{77175}My goodness! You remember all that?
{77179}{77295}Sure. I'm not as stupid|as I look from the outside.
{77299}{77367}What's Spanish for breakfast?|- Desayuno.
{77371}{77439}Let's take a paseado out|and get some desayuno.
{77443}{77510}Paseado?|- That means 'walk'.
{77514}{77582}That means 'have walked'.|But never mind. I'll get dressed.
{77586}{77654}Wait a minute.
{77658}{77702}First, write me a letter.
{77706}{77750}A letter?
{77754}{77836}In Spanish.|- Of course.
{77850}{77918}To whom is the letter addressed?
{77922}{77990}To the Honorable Davy Crockett Esquire.
{77994}{78062}You wish a letter written to yourself?|- Yep.
{78066}{78134}To the Honorable Davy Crockett Esquire...
{78138}{78254}...former Congressman of|the United States of America.
{78258}{78328}Esteemed sir...
{78426}{78500}Hurry it up there!
{78665}{78781}Seen Davy?|- Ain't nobody seen Davy. He ain't about.
{78785}{78890}First lie you've told today, Thimblerig.
{78905}{78949}Mornin', Davy!|- Howdy!
{78953}{78997}Say, Davy, what kind|of a load you got there?
{79001}{79069}Presents for some friends.
{79073}{79145}Let's go, Parson!
{79672}{79716}Halt! Who goes there?
{79720}{79764}Is that you, Bob?
{79768}{79836}Why, sure. Can't you see?
{79840}{79956}Then what kind of idiot nonsense|is this 'Who goes there'?
{79960}{80028}Well, Travis - Colonel Travis, that is -|he says that I should...
{80032}{80192}I don't care what Travis said. Open|the gate before I shoot you off that wall!
{80272}{80377}Sentry! Open the gate for Colonel Bowie!
{80631}{80699}Near a ton of good powder here, men!|Get it unloaded!
{80703}{80771}That long one there, he's Davy Crockett.
{80775}{80867}And three of his good men.|- Colonel Crockett.
{80871}{80915}Hello, Travis.
{80919}{80963}Looks like the answer to a prayer.
{80967}{81083}Colonel, I'd be pleased if you'd join me|in my quarters for some refreshment.
{81087}{81148}Proud to.
{81159}{81270}Oh, and you too,|Colonel Bowie, if you will.
{81495}{81562}I'm a stranger around these here parts.
{81566}{81634}What do you Texicans use|for drinkin' whiskey?
{81638}{81756}Drinkin' whiskey.|- You got manners or ain't you?
{81806}{81898}Captain Dickinson,|this is Colonel Davy Crockett.
{81902}{81946}Morning, Dick.
{81950}{82018}Oh, and this is my cousin Mrs Dickinson.
{82022}{82066}Colonel Crockett.|- Colonel Bowie.
{82070}{82138}Well, it's nice meeting you,|Davy Crockett.
{82142}{82186}I feel as if I know you already.
{82190}{82258}You see, part of my family|come from Tennessee...
{82262}{82378}{y:i}...and, well, your name is a household|word there. At least in our house it was.
{82382}{82450}Thank you, ma'am.|It's nice to be well thought of.
{82454}{82539}Mommy.|- Oh, yes, darling!
{82549}{82617}Oh! I've asked you|not to climb those stairs alone.
{82621}{82713}Well, who's this?|- You say hello to Colonel Crockett?
{82717}{82761}Hello.
{82765}{82833}Every size they get to|seems to be the most lovable.
{82837}{82927}Will you gentlemen excuse me?
{82933}{82977}Goodbye, Colonel.
{82981}{83025}Goodbye.
{83029}{83097}Kind of a shame|kids have to grow up into people.
{83101}{83214}It's good we're all here, gentlemen.|A cigar?
{83269}{83313}Please, make yourselves comfortable.
{83317}{83409}I have some news.|Fannin is doing well at Goliad.
{83413}{83457}He has mustered almost a thousand men...
{83461}{83552}{y:i}...and should be ready to move south|by the first of the week.
{83556}{83624}A thousand? It don't seem possible.
{83628}{83696}It does sound too good to be true,|I must confess.
{83700}{83744}But we can only admit|our doubts to each other.
{83748}{83840}In the privacy of a room|and not in front of the men.
{83844}{83960}As far as the volunteers are concerned,|we're sure Fannin has a thousand men.
{83964}{84032}I got a reputation for truth, Travis.|- I ain't.
{84036}{84104}Everybody says I'm a born liar.
{84108}{84224}But whether we talk out loud or quiet|don't seem to me the point right now.
{84228}{84320}The point is how many men has Fannin|and will he get here in time?
{84324}{84440}Whether he does or doesn't,|we'll be trapped here. And for no reason.
{84444}{84511}We should burn all of Bexar,|including this mission.
{84515}{84607}And annoy Santa Anna while he sweeps|north across the whole of Texas?
{84611}{84679}That's Colonel Bowie's theory!|- We could hit and run!
{84683}{84727}Jump him at every creek crossing...
{84731}{84799}You seem to forget one thing, Colonel!|That I command!
{84803}{84916}And I have already|decided against your plan!
{84947}{84991}Now...
{84995}{85039}Let us attack a more important problem.
{85043}{85111}Colonel Crockett's Tennesseans.
{85115}{85159}Will they fight, Colonel?
{85163}{85279}Last time I saw 'em they hadn't shown|any strong feelings against fighting.
{85283}{85375}Can you persuade them to come here?|- I can ask them.
{85379}{85471}And you're a very persuasive man|according to your reputation.
{85475}{85566}Build up the story that Fannin has|a thousand... no, two thousand men.
{85570}{85662}Play down the size of Santa Anna's...|- We've been through this.
{85666}{85734}He wants me to lie to my men, too.|Keep 'em here with lies.
{85738}{85830}Let the truth of Santa Anna's strength|be known and there won't be a dozen left!
{85834}{85926}You calling my boys cowards?|- Let us dispense with the pyrotechnics!
{85930}{86022}Remember this. My men are volunteers!|They're here because they wanna be!
{86026}{86155}But there's nothing to keep 'em|from gettin' outta here!
{86170}{86262}I'm aware that your men are militia.
{86266}{86310}And, like all volunteers, undisciplined.
{86314}{86396}Good day, Colonel Bowie.
{86577}{86717}Last night gave you a pretty good idea|of the discipline of my men.
{86721}{86813}Our position here is desperate.
{86817}{86954}And I feel sure that where Crockett leads|his men will follow.
{86961}{87005}Yeah.
{87009}{87139}That's a responsibility that's...|been kinda worrying me.
{87249}{87317}Thank you, gentlemen.|I'm gonna pass the word around.
{87321}{87413}What you Texans use for|drinkin' whiskey... is drinkin' whiskey.
{87417}{87508}And what's more important,|you got real good manners...
{87512}{87652}...seein' how you suffer the handicap|of having never been in Tennessee.
{87656}{87748}Davy, is it true that you fit|a four-day fight with Mike Fink?
{87752}{87820}Why, that's a blasted lie!
{87824}{87916}One of them stories|loose-mouthed people tell around.
{87920}{87964}Mike and me quit at sundown!
{87968}{88060}Wouldn't have been the fourth day|until, uh... next morning.
{88064}{88084}See you, men!
{88088}{88165}Let her rip, Parson!
{88615}{88659}Señora López.
{88663}{88707}Don Juan, this is Mr Davy Crockett.
{88711}{88755}I'm honoured.|- How do you do?
{88759}{88875}Señor Seguin is the alcalde... I mean,|the mayor of San Antonio de Bexar.
{88879}{88923}He's got a pretty busy town.
{88927}{88995}People are running like sheep|that have smelled a wolf pack.
{88999}{89067}I never said no such a thing!
{89071}{89187}When us took that powder in there, that|fella Travis asked if us Tennesseans...
{89191}{89259}{y:i}...was gonna join up with him. That's all.
{89263}{89331}He never asked us to fight his fight for him.
{89335}{89403}Have some breakfast.|- Breakfast?! Tortillas?
{89407}{89465}Tamale!
{89526}{89594}Never get burnt drinking this stuff.
{89598}{89690}Well, I only know part of Texas and|none of these Texicans is related to me...
{89694}{89762}{y:i}...so why should I fight for them?
{89766}{89834}Right. Ain't our ox that's gettin' gored.
{89838}{89930}Talkin' about whose ox|gets gored... figure this.
{89934}{90050}A fella gets in the habit of goring oxes,|whets his appetite.
{90054}{90122}He may come up north next|and gore yours.
{90126}{90226}Men, we're in a little fix, sort of.
{90246}{90338}The he-bull around here -|General Santa Anna. He's mad at us.
{90342}{90386}Yeah?
{90390}{90434}He's wrote us a letter.
{90438}{90482}I can't read it. It's in Spanish.
{90486}{90568}But the young lady will.
{90797}{90913}It is addressed to Davy Crockett and|the Tennesseans who accompany him.
{90917}{90961}Be it known:
{90965}{91057}You are interlopers in a country where|you are neither wanted nor welcome.
{91061}{91129}This is the order you are given.
{91133}{91225}Depart with all haste and at once,|because it has come to our attention...
{91229}{91345}{y:i}...that you are possibly considering joining|the rebels now skulking in the mission.
{91349}{91441}This is not your fight. Depart.
{91445}{91536}Should you fail to abide by this order...
{91540}{91608}{y:i}...I shall chastise you even unto death.
{91612}{91733}Signed: Generalissimo|Antonio Miguel de Santa Anna.
{91756}{91800}Huh!
{91804}{91872}Fella kinda fancies himself, don't he?
{91876}{91944}Sure does have a big-sounding name.
{91948}{92040}Givin' us orders. Who do he think he am?|Andy by God Jackson?
{92044}{92160}Riles me when somebody tells me|to go here or I can't go there.
{92164}{92208}I ain't never been run out of no place!
{92212}{92304}Except the time my old paw|kicked me over every acre...
{92308}{92376}{y:i}...of that half-section back there in Ohio.
{92380}{92448}But I was just a shirt-tail kid then.|My paw had big feet.
{92452}{92519}What do you say, Davy?|Are we gonna let this man...
{92523}{92591}{y:i}...tell us what we can or can't do?
{92595}{92731}Davy, maybe we'd better saddle up|and pay this fella a visit.
{92763}{92855}Do chastise mean what I think it do?|- It do.
{92859}{92975}Davy, let's do saddle up and go learn|that gentleman his manners.
{92979}{93095}We won't have to. He's wearin' out|horses comin' toward us.
{93099}{93167}Well, I guess we can't|stop him from coming.
{93171}{93239}But I reckon we can arrange|for him to limp going back.
{93243}{93359}I was thinking these Texicans|wasn't as neighbourly as they might be.
{93363}{93455}But here they've gone and arranged|a nice fight for us visitors.
{93459}{93550}One thing I oughta tell you.|Santa Anna never wrote that letter.
{93554}{93598}{y:i}I did.
{93602}{93670}Or rather... I had this lady here write it.
{93674}{93766}I was figuring how to tell you fellas|about this Texican hoedown.
{93770}{93886}I wondered what Santa Anna would've|said to us if he'd had a chance to say it.
{93890}{93958}Davy, I ain't never said|I ain't been whupped. I have.
{93962}{94054}But I give every one of them fellas|a chance to dig in and get the job done.
{94058}{94150}But I ain't never took nobody's word|that they was gonna chas...
{94154}{94222}Chastise.|- Chastise. Much obliged.
{94226}{94294}We're gonna stay, ain't we?|- I'm thinking it over.
{94298}{94366}What is there to think about?|You getting that old?
{94370}{94414}The man toed the mark and dared us!
{94418}{94509}Chastise, he said!|- That's right! Chastise!
{94513}{94581}But I wrote the letter!|- Don't you start weaslin'.
{94585}{94701}You said them'd be the words he'd write|if he was to write us a letter.
{94705}{94749}Well, gentlemen, you've convinced me.
{94753}{94797}We'll fight.
{94801}{94893}That's more like it!|- Now you're talkin', Davy!
{94897}{94941}First, the young lady and I|will take a pasear.
{94945}{95037}Gather up your possibles|and I'll meet up with you later.
{95041}{95148}Con permiso.|- Your Spanish is improving.
{95185}{95253}It kinda cheers me to see|the colonel with that lady.
{95257}{95349}Last couple of years he had me worried.
{95353}{95445}Lately he ain't been looking|at the girls like he was starved.
{95449}{95562}Being in Congress|has ruined many a good man.
{95712}{95780}All I hear is Crockett the bear-killer...
{95784}{95852}Crockett the Indian-fighter...
{95856}{95900}Crockett the brawler...
{95904}{95948}Crockett has brains.
{95952}{96020}Kept it hidden a number of years.
{96024}{96092}You like my Tennesseans, Flaca?|- Oh, yes.
{96096}{96188}Could strain 10,000|and never come up with 23 better.
{96192}{96308}Every one of those men has been|at my elbow, save the boy Smitty...
{96312}{96380}{y:i}...when some difficulty arose.
{96384}{96499}Some of them don't bathe as often|as polite folks would think necessary.
{96503}{96610}But every one of them smells sweet to me.
{96623}{96739}And I was the one that said|this country was burnt-over sand.
{96743}{96811}It's green and growing.
{96815}{96923}Like those green pastures they talk about.
{96935}{97038}Lord above! That's one beautiful tree!
{97606}{97650}This tree must've been growed...
{97654}{97790}...before man put his first|dirty footprints on this prairie.
{97846}{97963}Kind of a tree Adam and Eve|must have met under.
{98134}{98202}You know something, Flaca?
{98206}{98250}I guess I saw who knows how many trees...
{98254}{98346}...before I ever took|a long, thoughtful look at one.
{98350}{98512}Mostly I looked at a tree to see was there|a bear in it or an Indian behind it.
{98517}{98609}Davy, what's going to happen to us?
{98613}{98681}I mean, to you and me.
{98685}{98753}I'm gonna tell you something, Flaca,|and I want you to listen tight.
{98757}{98849}It may sound like I'm talking about me,|but I'm talkin' about you.
{98853}{98921}In fact, I'm talking about|all people everywhere.
{98925}{99017}When I came down here to Texas,|I was looking for something.
{99021}{99089}I didn't know what.
{99093}{99137}It seems like you added up my life...
{99141}{99281}{y:i}...and I'd spent it all either stomping other|men or in some cases getting stomped.
{99285}{99353}Had me some money|and had me some medals.
{99357}{99473}But none of it seemed a lifetime|worth the pain of the mother that bore me.
{99477}{99520}It's like I was empty.
{99524}{99568}Well, I'm not empty any more.
{99572}{99640}That's what's important.
{99644}{99688}To feel useful in this old world.
{99692}{99808}To hit a lick against what's wrong,|or to say a word for what's right...
{99812}{99904}{y:i}...even though you get walloped|for sayin' that word.
{99908}{100000}I may sound like a Bible-beater|yellin' up a revival at a camp meeting...
{100004}{100072}{y:i}...but that don't change the truth none.
{100076}{100144}There's right and there's wrong.|You gotta do one or the other.
{100148}{100216}You do the one and you're living.
{100220}{100383}You do the other and you may be walking|around, but you're dead as a beaver hat.
{100436}{100551}I'd hoped for a horse, but there's|nothing wrong with a good strong mule.
{100555}{100617}My things!
{100627}{100671}All my luggage is in the buggy!
{100675}{100719}Had my men take care of it.
{100723}{100850}Your geegaws may be rough-packed|but they're all there.
{100963}{101055}You are sending me away. You...
{101059}{101175}You talked about the fight|against evil but you...
{101179}{101247}You are sending me to safety.
{101251}{101319}Flaca, you have an important name.
{101323}{101391}You know a million words|and how they should be used.
{101395}{101510}I'm sending you to fight your war,|to talk up a howling mob.
{101514}{101605}I'll stay here and hit a lick.
{101634}{101678}I hope you can drive a mule.
{101682}{101726}His name's Jesús, they told me.
{101730}{101820}He seems a good, honest mule.
{101970}{102038}Maybe I'll never see you again.
{102042}{102110}If that's what's written,|that's what's written.
{102114}{102158}When it's time, it's time.
{102162}{102230}Talkin' only makes it the harder, Flaca.
{102234}{102278}So stir up that mule.
{102282}{102344}Davy, I...
{102665}{102755}You never pray, do you, Davy?
{102833}{102914}I never found the time.
{103504}{103576}Sir! Tennesseans.
{103672}{103740}Colonel Travis!
{103744}{103822}Crockett and his men.
{103888}{103932}Go down and open the gate.
{103936}{103980}I'll just holler down.
{103984}{104076}Your orders were to go down,|not holler down, Mr Dennison!
{104080}{104141}Yes, sir.
{104511}{104555}Crack shots, those Tennesseans.
{104559}{104651}Twenty times their number's|what we need, and more.
{104655}{104747}Oh, I'm sorry, Will. Such gloomy|remarks are for your ears alone.
{104751}{104861}Isn't that Bowie galloping up to catch 'em?
{104943}{105011}I can just hear him pleading his cause.
{105015}{105083}Crockett seems to me the type of man|that would choose Bowie.
{105087}{105155}What you mean is|he isn't the type of man to choose me.
{105159}{105251}Oh, Will. Depend on you|to say it the most brutal way.
{105255}{105335}Most facts are brutal!
{105423}{105491}Just look at that great knife fighter|yapping at Crockett.
{105495}{105562}Cut, slash, and run!
{105566}{105634}Let's get mounted. Cut, slash, and run!
{105638}{105682}Cut, slash, and run.
{105686}{105778}Cost Santa Anna a hundred troops|at every creek crossing...
{105782}{105826}...between here and the North.
{105830}{105898}Sounds reasonable the way you put it...
{105902}{105970}{y:i}...but Travis has a point, too.|Takes thinkin' on.
{105974}{105994}Hey, Jim!
{105998}{106042}Halt! Who goes there?
{106046}{106162}Bob, I swear I'm gonna shoot you|off that wall. Are you blind?
{106166}{106210}That's what I was told to holler every time.
{106214}{106282}Well, don't holler at me!
{106286}{106306}Idiot.
{106310}{106420}You think on it, Davy. You'll side with me.
{106621}{106665}What is it?
{106669}{106761}Tennesseans, Nell. 23 of 'em.|All the way from home.
{106765}{106857}Do you recognise any, Jocko?|Is my brother Malachi with them?
{106861}{106929}He was a fella to go|where there was trouble.
{106933}{106977}He was that.
{106981}{107025}But, Nell, you know Malachi was hung.
{107029}{107113}Or so some folks told us.
{107125}{107265}Colonel Crockett. I am glad you were able|to persuade your men to join us.
{107269}{107313}Well, they insisted, sort of.
{107317}{107385}Our heartiest welcome!
{107389}{107433}Ladies and gentlemen...
{107437}{107528}{y:i}...we are proud to welcome|these patriotic men...
{107532}{107624}{y:i}...who have travelled 1500 miles|to join us in our hour of need.
{107628}{107672}Sergeant Lightfoot!|- Yes, sir?
{107676}{107768}You will have your men|raise a cheer for our gallant allies...
{107772}{107840}...from the illustrious state of Tennessee!|- Yes, sir!
{107844}{107912}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{107916}{107960}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{107964}{108032}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{108036}{108128}Captain, you will attend to|the billeting of these men.
{108132}{108272}After you are quartered, I will take you|on a tour of the emplacements.
{108276}{108353}This way, gentlemen.
{108396}{108478}Crockett! Davy Crockett!
{108492}{108583}We're from Tennessee.|- Well, howdy, folks!
{108587}{108655}We seen you when you came|to Stink Wells...
{108659}{108703}{y:i}...to speak about that job for the Congress.
{108707}{108775}You shook hands with me.|- I'll do her again.
{108779}{108847}He didn't vote for you, though.
{108851}{108895}Other fella gave him four bits.|- I'm sorry.
{108899}{108991}Don't be. Glad there were|enough sensible folks like you...
{108995}{109039}{y:i}...to vote me out of that job.
{109043}{109135}Well, later on we'll have|a real old home talkfest.
{109139}{109293}Right now we've got to get quartered|and bedded down. Would you excuse us?
{109307}{109408}You should have voted for him, Jocko.
{109522}{109600}¡Soldados! ¡Soldados!
{109978}{110068}{y:i}¡Columna a la izquierda!
{110410}{110525}Of our 24 pieces of ordnance,|five are these six-pounders.
{110529}{110619}Something's stirring in town!
{110817}{110861}Ladies will take cover, please!
{110865}{110956}Men, to your battle positions!
{111489}{111556}¡Los documentos!
{111560}{111604}Los documentos.
{111608}{111729}{y:i}Teniente, cumpla con sus órdenes.|- Sí, señor.
{112280}{112348}Captain Dickinson,|are your men disposed?
{112352}{112429}At their posts, sir!
{112519}{112587}No one will fire unless I so order!
{112591}{112721}Those people are under|the protection of a flag of truce.
{112855}{112923}¡Columna alto!
{113023}{113139}From Generalissimo Antonio López de|Santa Anna, absolute ruler of Mexico...
{113143}{113211}{y:i}...to the rebel commander|who deems himself in command...
{113215}{113283}{y:i}...of the rebels occupying the mission.
{113287}{113331}Be it known:
{113335}{113403}The province of Mexico known as Texas...
{113407}{113498}{y:i}...has shown itself to be|in active and treasonous revolt...
{113502}{113570}...against the rule of|Generalissimo Santa Anna.
{113574}{113618}The generalissimo issues|the following order.
{113622}{113714}All occupants of the mission|will leave at once...
{113718}{113786}...leaving all arms|and ammunition behind them.
{113790}{113858}If this order is not followed with dispatch...
{113862}{113930}{y:i}...the generalissimo will reduce|the mission by assault.
{113934}{114027}There will be no quarter given.
{114222}{114266}{y:i}¡Columna a la derecha!
{114270}{114331}¡Marchen!
{114821}{114911}Well, what do you think, Jim?
{114941}{115081}I hate to say anything good about|that long-winded jackanapes...
{115085}{115211}{y:i}...but he does know|the short way to start a war.
{115756}{115821}The Sixth...
{115828}{115923}The Sixth Vera Cruzano Fusiliers.
{115996}{116088}They're bivouacking about|a mile south of our west bastion.
{116092}{116160}Light artillery, lancers, some engineers.
{116164}{116280}Not one unit of heavy assault troops yet,|and it still adds up to 2,000 men.
{116284}{116352}That'll be to our advantage, Dick.
{116356}{116448}That main body must be|strung out for miles.
{116452}{116543}The assault infantry,|heavy artillery and supply trains...
{116547}{116591}They won't be here for four or five days.
{116595}{116663}The actual battle can't start until then.
{116667}{116759}Oh, there'll be an occasional sortie|feeling out our defences.
{116763}{116879}But they won't commit to an attack until|Santa Anna is here with his main force.
{116883}{116986}Then what?|- Then Fannin will be here.
{117123}{117191}More troops arriving every hour.
{117195}{117263}Prettiest army I ever did see.
{117267}{117311}Yeah.
{117315}{117383}If I take my men out, do you go with me?
{117387}{117479}Davy, you know this old mission|can't stand up to Santa Anna's army.
{117483}{117550}My way's the only way.|- Travis says that Fannin's coming.
{117554}{117713}Travis says! I wouldn't take Travis's|word that night's dark and day's light.
{117770}{117790}Blowin' on a horn. That's all.
{117794}{117862}Chicken in the bread bag,|pickin' up the corn. That's all.
{117866}{117934}Flies in the buttermilk.|Shoo, fly, shoo! That's all.
{117938}{118006}Ants in the sugar bowl.|Two by two. That's all.
{118010}{118126}I carried twice as much!|- You're twice as big.
{118130}{118207}Patrol's in trouble!
{118657}{118701}Doggone it, Beekeeper!
{118705}{118797}I thought you wasn't gonna open|that corn liquor till nightfall!
{118801}{118893}It's only a half-hour till dark.
{118897}{118965}Besides, it's my keg, ain't it?
{118969}{119013}Well, all right. Give me some of that stuff!
{119017}{119085}I'm so scared I could drink all of it!
{119089}{119133}Maybe I will.
{119137}{119205}What'd you see, Irish?
{119209}{119277}More than I wanted to, Jim.|A lot of men arriving.
{119281}{119373}And they got the durned|blastedest cannon ever I did see!
{119377}{119454}Something like this.
{119568}{119636}12 or 14 foot long maybe!
{119640}{119708}He sure draws pretty, don't he?|- Frightening!
{119712}{119780}12 or 14 feet long. Are you sure, Irish?
{119784}{119828}Well, yeah...|- Finn!
{119832}{119876}Yes, sir!
{119880}{119972}You were ordered to report to me,|not to hold lecture courses. Get up here!
{119976}{120081}All right, Will... uh... Colonel Travis.
{120144}{120188}Hey, Travis! With a cannon like that...
{120192}{120308}{y:i}...them Santa Anna fellas can just sit up|there and give us what for, can't they?
{120312}{120380}There's no such cannon|in the North American continent.
{120384}{120452}They have some in Europe,|according to last reports.
{120456}{120547}Acting Lieutenant Finn is exaggerating.
{120551}{120609}¡Fuego!
{120743}{120873}She's a big one, Davy!|And she's shooting from over here!
{121055}{121123}Battery One! Is your gun ready?
{121127}{121171}We're primed and ready, sir!
{121175}{121219}Give it full elevation!
{121223}{121284}Yes, sir!
{121367}{121411}The gun is ready, sir!
{121415}{121470}Fire!
{121654}{121757}Kinda short there, Colonel, Mr Travis!
{121870}{121986}I'm sure I'm glad I seen that there cannon|sitting out there on that prairie.
{121990}{122058}For a minute I thought|they was shooting at us...
{122062}{122106}{y:i}...from one of them countries|over in Europe.
{122110}{122154}Oh, my goodness!
{122158}{122210}No!
{122230}{122298}Oh, no! They wouldn't dare!
{122302}{122412}Man, that ain't no fair way to fight a war!
{122517}{122609}Well, I guess we'd better do|somethin' about that, Crockett.
{122613}{122681}Plain as can be.|- About an hour after dark?
{122685}{122729}Good.
{122733}{122777}Thimblerig, 15 men.
{122781}{122825}Right after dark.
{122829}{122891}All sober.
{123141}{123161}Boo!
{123165}{123233}Halt!|- I lost the bet.
{123237}{123305}I bet my friends I could sneak up|on you without you hearing me.
{123309}{123420}Friend, you like to got a hole in your head.
{123429}{123481}Ha!
{123500}{123634}Tie him loose.|- Kick that fire out and kill our silhouette.
{123644}{123738}Let's go. Company One, let's go!
{124052}{124096}Everything set?|- Yes, sir.
{124100}{124144}All right. It's time, men.
{124148}{124240}Open the gate!|- Colonel Travis, sentry here!
{124244}{124312}Somebody jumped me!|- I'll say they did!
{124316}{124432}Shoved me down, tied me up, and|some of them stepped on me goin' by.
{124436}{124551}And never so much as|a by-your-leave from every one of them.
{124555}{124613}Dammit!
{124675}{124743}Return to your posts.|- Yes, sir.
{124747}{124817}Close the gate!
{124867}{124935}Well, you'd better get|your men mounted, then.
{124939}{125007}See if you can give them any help.|- Yes, sir.
{125011}{125092}Detail! Stand to horse!
{125634}{125704}Get the powder!
{125874}{125984}Where's the mud?|- It's comin'. Here it is.
{127025}{127093}¿Qúe es?|- ¡Es un cañon!
{127097}{127165}Clear out! I'll cover!
{127169}{127243}You heard the man.
{127361}{127472}Come on, kid! Get outta here!|- I can shoot.
{127504}{127611}Golly! What a gun!|- Go on! Grab a horse!
{127792}{127859}Cannon party!
{127864}{127932}No one will fire until|you can identify your target!
{127936}{127997}Yes, sir!
{128104}{128211}Let's give 'em a hand, boys! Knock on it!
{128559}{128627}Pick 'em up! Pick 'em up!
{128631}{128744}Everybody rides double!|Come on! Pick 'em up!
{129255}{129385}Hold the gate! Hold the gate!|- Somebody's still outside!
{129542}{129610}Close the gate!
{129614}{129658}Good work, Smitty!
{129662}{129730}We never missed you.|Good thing the kid did.
{129734}{129778}That horse folded with me.
{129782}{129826}You all right, Jim?|- Sure.
{129830}{129898}Oh, Mr Smith! You've been hurt!|- Oh, it's all right.
{129902}{129970}Let's take a look at that.|- Doctor!
{129974}{130018}Mm. No bones broken.
{130022}{130090}All you need is a little|Doctor Beekeeper's fix-all.
{130094}{130155}See? I...
{130190}{130234}Pretty close.
{130238}{130354}Bowie?|- Oh, he's all right. Turned a horse over.
{130358}{130402}Jethro?|- Yes, sir.
{130406}{130497}Tell Colonel Bowie|I wish to speak to him at once.
{130501}{130545}Yes, sir.
{130549}{130617}Over here, where we can|have a little privacy.
{130621}{130682}Yes, sir.
{131077}{131164}Post this area.|- Yes, sir!
{131245}{131337}Will, considering the way|things turned out, I...
{131341}{131422}Dick, leave this to me.
{131940}{132008}Colonel Bowie.
{132012}{132125}I have had just about|enough insubordination.
{132132}{132176}You have?
{132180}{132248}All right. Let's get to it. When and where?
{132252}{132320}I hear you're a good shot,|so let's choose pistols.
{132324}{132392}I assumed you would choose|the ruffian's knife.
{132396}{132440}Gentlemen, I beg...|- Dick, act for me!
{132444}{132488}Time?
{132492}{132587}I suggest after this war is over.
{132611}{132655}Yes.
{132659}{132727}The minute...|the very minute this war is over.
{132731}{132799}Jim?|- That's fine with me.
{132803}{132871}One last word, Bowie.
{132875}{132919}This evening's episode...
{132923}{133015}By going on a mission without orders|you endangered this command.
{133019}{133087}If it had not been for|the intervention of Captain Dickinson...
{133091}{133183}{y:i}...a large number of volunteers|would now be dead out there...
{133187}{133231}...instead of at their posts in here.
{133235}{133327}I demand your word of honour that|there will no repetition of such conduct.
{133331}{133447}Or else I shall be forced|to order your arrest.
{133522}{133583}Travis...
{133594}{133724}Don't you worry any more|about arrest or insubordination.
{133738}{133833}I take my people out at daybreak.
{133978}{134046}Colonel Travis...
{134050}{134094}I'm an old man...
{134098}{134182}{y:i}...but you're wrong.
{134266}{134334}That Jethro...
{134338}{134382}Reminds me of a story...
{134386}{134430}Please, Crockett!
{134434}{134501}No homespun wisdom.|No cracker-barrel philosophy.
{134505}{134644}None of the backwoods wit|for which you are famous. Good night!
{134649}{134717}You'd better slack off on me, mister.
{134721}{134813}This code of honour business|doesn't bother me a bit.
{134817}{134885}When there's trouble|I come from any direction...
{134889}{134933}{y:i}...as sudden and surprising as I can.
{134937}{135029}My only concern here is 23 Tennesseans.
{135033}{135149}So you'd better let me know|what's in your mind.
{135153}{135277}I'd have thought that would|have been obvious to you.
{135321}{135389}It's as simple as this.
{135393}{135461}There's Santa Anna with 7,000 men.
{135465}{135532}Up here is the Sabine River.
{135536}{135580}Somewhere around here...
{135584}{135652}{y:i}...Sam Houston is trying|to organise an army.
{135656}{135748}And right in between... is the Alamo.
{135752}{135868}Santa Anna can't go around and leave|a fort along his lines of communication.
{135872}{135916}He must reduce the Alamo by storm.
{135920}{136012}Every minute of time|we buy for Sam Houston...
{136016}{136084}{y:i}...is another precious minute|in the life of Texas.
{136088}{136180}And nobody is ever going to say|that William Barrett Travis...
{136184}{136276}{y:i}...did not buy every minute possible.
{136280}{136348}Makes sense.|Why didn't you tell Bowie that?
{136352}{136420}A commander does not have|to explain his every decision.
{136424}{136492}You explained to me.
{136496}{136539}I have great respect for you, Crockett.
{136543}{136659}But I have none for that|knife-fighting adventurer.
{136663}{136755}I figured any fella that shouldered|a gun was deserving of respect.
{136759}{136851}But then I'm not... a real soldier.
{136855}{136923}I never fought anybody but Injuns.
{136927}{136995}Less'n you count the British.
{136999}{137060}Crockett.
{137119}{137211}I must ask you to forgive|my rudeness earlier on to you.
{137215}{137310}I'm an easy forgiver... at times.
{137335}{137410}Good night, Travis.
{137838}{137930}Crack out a couple of jugs|and bring that guitar.
{137934}{137978}What are we gonna do, Davy?
{137982}{138043}Serenade.
{138342}{138362}Well...
{138366}{138458}I hope you told that long-winded idiot|what you think of him.
{138462}{138596}I'm not rightly sure what I think of him.|- What's all this?
{138605}{138721}Well, I figured we'd crack a jug|and tell each other our troubles.
{138725}{138769}Now wait a minute, Crockett.
{138773}{138841}Don't try your winnin' ways on me.|My mind's made up.
{138845}{138913}Well, we can have a farewell drink.
{138917}{138961}You mean you're stayin'?
{138965}{139033}That's what I figure, Jim.
{139037}{139105}All right. We'll have a drink or two or ten.
{139109}{139177}But you ain't gonna get me drunk|and change my mind.
{139181}{139249}Of course not!
{139421}{139465}Water patrol! Let's go!
{139469}{139536}Rise and shine! Up and at 'em!
{139540}{139584}Beekeeper, come on! Show a leg!
{139588}{139632}Get out of there!
{139636}{139704}Thimblerig, come on! It's your duty.
{139708}{139776}It's your duty!|- You don't have to wake us all!
{139780}{139903}I'll get 'em up, Sergeant.|- Thanks, Parson. Thanks.
{139924}{139968}Hey!
{139972}{140064}Two dollars American|if you take out my patrol.
{140068}{140160}Two dollars? This morning|I wouldn't take your patrol for ten.
{140164}{140268}I would!|- Got yourself a deal, Scotty.
{140356}{140467}Well, Davy, it looks like you done it again.
{140500}{140557}It do.
{140571}{140672}And Bowie?|- Looked like a tie to me.
{140787}{140849}Your duty!
{141554}{141622}Good morning, Colonel.|He's still sleepin'.
{141626}{141719}I'll take care of that, Jethro.
{141770}{141814}Aaagh!
{141818}{141872}Hey!
{141938}{141982}Ow!
{141986}{142047}Crockett!
{142058}{142119}Crockett!
{142202}{142294}Crockett, what the devil...|- Good morning, Smitty. Doc.
{142298}{142342}Davy.|- Good morning.
{142346}{142401}Well!
{142418}{142486}You got yourself famous.|Now when they talk about Jim Bowie...
{142490}{142581}...they'll tell about the man that|pulled him out from under the troops.
{142585}{142629}Gee! Will they?
{142633}{142725}Jim, the kid wants to know|about that sand bar episode.
{142729}{142773}Oh, come on, Crockett!|- That's the truth.
{142777}{142869}He's never heard anything but hearsay.|- Gosh, yes, Mr Bowie!
{142873}{142989}All the fellas back home talk about...|- By the way, Smitty...
{142993}{143068}Say goodbye to Jim.
{143089}{143194}Are you going someplace, Colonel... Jim?
{143209}{143261}No.
{143281}{143373}No, I'm not goin' noplace.|That's just Crockett's idea of a joke.
{143377}{143421}Now you get well, Smitty, boy.
{143425}{143509}And thanks for your help.
{143784}{143876}What are you doin'?|- It was rumoured we were leavin'.
{143880}{144010}I'll tell you when we're leaving.|Get that gear put away.
{144024}{144085}Crockett.
{144695}{144763}By God, boy! You're bad-tempered!
{144767}{144835}Don't you ever try to make|a fool out of me again!
{144839}{144883}Once is enough.|- I make up my own mind.
{144887}{144955}Never thought otherwise, Jim.
{144959}{145075}I was wondering... You think there'd be|a mouthful of that corn juice left?
{145079}{145147}We could kinda|cut the tar out of our throats.
{145151}{145219}That's a great idea, Davy!
{145223}{145300}That's a great idea!
{145343}{145437}I still say you're bad-tempered.
{145558}{145616}¡Amigo!
{145630}{145698}Halt! Who goes there?
{145702}{145770}Don't shoot, amigo!
{145774}{145856}A message for Jim Bowie.
{145870}{145941}In the sombrero!
{146110}{146130}Jim!
{146134}{146252}Fella says there's a message|in this hat for you.
{146302}{146394}Huh! Kind of a strange way|to be sending messages, ain't it?
{146398}{146453}Yeah.
{146470}{146560}Maybe Santa Anna surrendered.
{147644}{147715}What is it, Jim?
{147764}{147832}I never... knew the night...
{147836}{147913}...could be so dark.
{147980}{148051}My... my wife...
{148100}{148157}She...
{148172}{148240}She's... dead.
{148436}{148518}I lived through it, Jim.
{148555}{148617}It's hard.
{148627}{148695}It was the plague.
{148699}{148770}The damn plague!
{148819}{148893}Oh, God, dear God!
{149107}{149151}Oh, Davy... she...
{149155}{149223}She was so small.
{149227}{149307}So tiny. So very tiny.
{149347}{149439}She wanted to stay in Bexar|to be near me, but...
{149443}{149534}{y:i}...I made her go to Coahuila.
{149538}{149606}I made her go!
{149658}{149729}My man Parson...
{149754}{149822}He's a kind of a preacher.
{149826}{149900}He keeps sayin'...
{149922}{150012}...little do we mortals know.
{150162}{150243}Hold your head up, Jim.
{150306}{150350}Colonel Bowie...
{150354}{150422}You've had a communication|from outside these walls.
{150426}{150470}This is against my orders.
{150474}{150572}What information have you received?
{150593}{150680}Bowie, hand me that letter!
{150761}{150838}You may die tonight.
{150857}{150925}That little lady, Jim.
{150929}{151003}She won't like it.
{151888}{151932}Colonel Bowie...
{151936}{152044}Please accept|my most profound sympathy...
{152056}{152172}{y:i}...and my regret for having|disturbed you at such a moment.
{152176}{152345}This in no way impairs your right to call|me on the field of honour at a later date.
{152511}{152603}But I wish to express my sorrow for you...
{152607}{152753}{y:i}...and present my apology for|being such a boor at such a time.
{152775}{152819}Travis...
{152823}{152910}You can't help bein' you...
{152943}{153040}{y:i}...and I can't help bein' me.
{153638}{153754}What's that all about, Sergeant?|- 32 cases hospitalised today, sir.
{153758}{153850}Well... Tell 'em to move over|after last night's party...
{153854}{153946}Oh, no, sir. Women and children.
{153950}{154031}Another officers' call.
{154046}{154090}See for yourself. It's all like that.
{154094}{154148}Sir.
{154166}{154228}Gentlemen.
{154238}{154306}Doctor.|- It's as simple as this, gentlemen.
{154310}{154378}I had 32 cases|of mild dysentery this morning.
{154382}{154474}I tested the salt pork barrel the rations|were issued from. It's tainted.
{154478}{154545}So is every other barrel in the warehouse.
{154549}{154569}Sergeant.
{154573}{154617}Barring the pork, I figure we have...
{154621}{154757}...three or four days' full rations|to serve to the garrison.
{154789}{154833}You see the dilemma, gentlemen.
{154837}{154881}We are almost out of food.
{154885}{155001}However, Santa Anna does not|suffer under the same handicap.
{155005}{155049}Therefore our course is obvious.
{155053}{155130}If you'll follow me.
{155149}{155247}{y:i}? Vuelve, el gitano, vuelve...
{155485}{155540}¡Olé!
{156132}{156224}I can think of more comfortable places|to watch that show from.
{156228}{156285}Quiet!
{156827}{156871}Dick.
{156875}{156936}Yes, sir?
{156971}{157039}It's a half-hour to daybreak.
{157043}{157087}Have your men stand to horse.
{157091}{157152}Yes, sir.
{159728}{159772}The night herders.
{159776}{159844}Two to each one of 'em.
{159848}{159916}Don't miss.|There'll be a lot of hungry kids.
{159920}{159964}Take 'em.
{159968}{160026}Smitty.
{160064}{160132}Grab a horse off that picket line for Smitty.
{160136}{160180}Get a good one.
{160184}{160228}Colonel Davy?
{160232}{160300}Can I ask you fellas|something face to face?
{160304}{160348}Sure thing, kid.
{160352}{160468}Are you really sending me because|I'm a good horseman like you said?
{160472}{160515}As I live and breathe!
{160519}{160587}You're smarter than Beekeeper|and you swim better than the gambler.
{160591}{160683}It ain't that you don't think I'd be|worth my salt when the fighting starts?
{160687}{160731}Smitty, let me tell you something.
{160735}{160851}Of all the men in this outfit, I'd pick you|to side me if the goin' was rough.
{160855}{160923}You see?|- Gee!
{160927}{161001}Get on this horse.
{161071}{161139}There's nothing out there,|kid, but dark.
{161143}{161217}Good luck, Smitty.
{161311}{161379}It'll take him quite a few days|to get to Houston.
{161383}{161463}That's what I figured.
{161790}{161834}The south side's all taken care of.
{161838}{161903}Get a horse.
{161934}{162019}Now all we can do is wait.
{162030}{162074}That's the hardest part.
{162078}{162142}It sure is.
{162198}{162263}Column halt!
{162294}{162338}Carry on, Dick.
{162342}{162386}Good luck.|- Thank you, Will.
{162390}{162458}Best of luck, Dickinson.
{162462}{162532}Forward, yo-ho!
{162989}{163119}If they don't shoot pretty quick,|we've got to go anyway.
{163397}{163467}Let's take 'em!
{165411}{165481}Hold your fire!
{165506}{165526}Hold your fire!
{165530}{165574}Pick your targets!
{165578}{165622}Fire!
{165626}{165693}Fire at will!
{165890}{165958}Second rank, fire!
{165962}{166040}Fall back! Fall back!
{166130}{166192}Fall back!
{166729}{166749}Fire!
{166753}{166797}Fall back!
{166801}{166845}Second rank!
{166849}{166893}Fire!
{166897}{166959}Fall back!
{167017}{167061}Third rank!
{167065}{167085}Ready?
{167089}{167144}Fire!
{167353}{167417}Cease fire!
{167640}{167684}Close the gate!
{167688}{167756}There's one thing for sure.
{167760}{167804}He's a bearcat for nerve.
{167808}{167852}I'm grateful for that.
{167856}{167948}I'd hate to look at a coward|over a duellin' pistol.
{167952}{168068}You're not much for this forgive|and forget business, are you, Jim?
{168072}{168124}No.
{168575}{168619}Beef for supper.
{168623}{168684}Yes, sir.
{168791}{168859}Hog never rightly could pass for meat.
{168863}{168924}But beef!
{169127}{169195}The big he-bull himself!
{169199}{169243}Let's go!
{169247}{169291}Ladies to cover!
{169295}{169369}Men to your posts!
{170110}{170154}Captain Dickinson.|- Yes, sir.
{170158}{170250}Order all men fed in relays.|Full issue of ammunition.
{170254}{170315}Yes, sir.
{170470}{170537}That's the best-dressed army I ever saw.
{170541}{170609}Fancy clothes don't make a fightin' man.
{170613}{170681}They're just off two years|puttin' down revolts.
{170685}{170763}They're fightin' men.
{171668}{171760}Generalissimo Santa Anna has just|arrived with the main body of his army...
{171764}{171808}{y:i}...and has only now become aware...
{171812}{171880}{y:i}...that there are women|and children in the mission.
{171884}{171952}He wishes that the ladies|receive his apologies...
{171956}{172024}{y:i}...and be informed he has|never attacked a position...
{172028}{172096}...without the enemy|being given the opportunity...
{172100}{172168}{y:i}...to evacuate women and children.
{172172}{172264}According, you have one hour in which|to evacuate these noncombatants...
{172268}{172336}{y:i}...who will be provided with transport...
{172340}{172408}{y:i}...to proceed to such destination|as is their choice.
{172412}{172503}Signed: Antonio López|de Santa Anna, ruler of Mexico.
{172507}{172572}Your answer?
{172675}{172743}My compliments to the general|for his gallantry.
{172747}{172845}We will evacuate our noncombatants.
{173131}{173199}Single men will remain at their posts!
{173203}{173329}Married men will arrange|transport for their families!
{174066}{174158}Sue, you'd better hurry.|- She won't go.
{174162}{174254}Save your breath, Will.|Your ever so persuasive breath.
{174258}{174302}All right, say it.
{174306}{174374}It's a sorry man|that can't make his wife obey.
{174378}{174446}You seem to forget, Dick,|that I too am married.
{174450}{174517}I've got to do what I think is the right thing.
{174521}{174613}I'm a soldier's wife.|My child is a soldier's child.
{174617}{174661}We'll stay.
{174665}{174709}Very well, Sue.
{174713}{174757}Dick.
{174761}{174829}Don't be angry with me.
{174833}{174877}I'm not angry.
{174881}{174943}I'm proud.
{175001}{175099}Dick, take your patrol.|- Yes, sir.
{175169}{175237}Married men, return to your posts!
{175241}{175285}Open the gate!
{175289}{175333}Captain Dickinson!
{175337}{175381}Escort! Forward!
{175385}{175442}Yo-ho!
{175624}{175740}Ma'am, I ain't got no woman to say|goodbye to. Could I tell you goodbye?
{175744}{175802}Surely.
{175816}{175887}Get up, boy! Ya!
{175984}{176028}Jocko, Nell.
{176032}{176094}It's time.
{176559}{176656}Go on, Jocko. Do the best you can.
{176967}{177026}I can't.
{177135}{177194}I can't.
{177303}{177347}I just can't do it, fellas.
{177351}{177419}Colonel Bowie.
{177423}{177467}This is a request and not an order.
{177471}{177538}But I suggest that,|as desperate as our needs are...
{177542}{177658}{y:i}...that family's needs are more desperate.
{177662}{177778}Get in that line, Jocko,|and move out with your people.
{177782}{177826}You can see how it is.
{177830}{177874}It's more than a man can bear.
{177878}{178018}She's never said a word of pity for herself|in the ten years she's been blind.
{178022}{178066}Will Travis!|Just who do you think you are?
{178070}{178234}Mrs Robertson, I can assure you that no|blame will attach itself to your husband.
{178238}{178330}Get movin', Jocko, or I'll help you|along with the toe of my boot.
{178334}{178402}Shut up, Jim Bowie!|And you and Travis listen close.
{178406}{178521}My man ain't goin' out. He's just as much|a man as either one of you. Maybe more.
{178525}{178641}In spite of he ain't rich like you, Jim,|or fancy educated like you, Will Travis.
{178645}{178689}Now, Jocko, you get back up on that wall.
{178693}{178785}Cos you're just as good as|any man that ever trod leather.
{178789}{178833}And it's your right.
{178837}{178953}And I can't see, but I'm just as good|as any woman in Texas.
{178957}{179025}And it's my right to go and leave you.
{179029}{179145}Now we've cuddled nice and said|all our goodbyes, but I'll say it again.
{179149}{179193}We'd be fools not to face it.
{179197}{179265}You're likely to go and get|yourself killed in this battle.
{179269}{179361}I don't know what you're going|to say at the gates of heaven...
{179365}{179481}{y:i}...but I'm gonna say no woman ever lived|had herself a better husband than you.
{179485}{179547}Now go on!
{179844}{179912}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{179916}{179960}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{179964}{180039}Hip! Hip!|- Hooray!
{181091}{181159}Captain Dickinson!
{181163}{181207}Yes, sir.
{181211}{181255}Have the Doctor set up|the hospital in the chapel.
{181259}{181379}You will take charge of Battery No. 4.|- Yes, sir.
{182338}{182435}{y:i}¡Clarines! ¡Suenen al ataque!
{182482}{182544}¡Adelante!
{183033}{183101}Hold your fire.
{183105}{183175}Hold your fire.
{183273}{183334}Take 'em!
{183920}{183964}Straight frontal attack!
{183968}{184108}We need more men up here!|I'll get some strength from Dickinson.
{184519}{184601}North wall! Hurry it up!
{184687}{184777}Who is it?|- It's the Parson.
{185502}{185599}{y:i}¡Clarines! ¡Suenen al retiro!
{185886}{185930}Hold your fire!
{185934}{186029}Hold your fire! They're retiring!
{186486}{186529}See did any of our boys get hurt.
{186533}{186673}I'll be below gettin' washed on|the outside and wet down inside.
{186677}{186758}We've been lucky today.
{186821}{186865}Check the damage.
{186869}{186960}Officers' call in ten minutes.
{186965}{187037}Bring on another.
{187972}{188064}Sure killed many a brave man today.
{188068}{188160}It's funny. I was proud of 'em.
{188164}{188280}Even while I was killin' 'em|I was proud of 'em.
{188284}{188352}Speaks well for men|that so many ain't afraid to die...
{188356}{188448}...because they think right's on their side.
{188452}{188517}Speaks well.
{188691}{188759}Post this area, Lightfoot.|- It's already done.
{188763}{188807}All right, Sergeant.
{188811}{188855}Report!|- 50 casualties.
{188859}{188927}28 dead, 22 wounded.
{188931}{188999}Morale... high.
{189003}{189095}Morale ain't gonna help us much|if Fannin don't get here... and quick!
{189099}{189143}Ow, Doc!|- Quit squawking.
{189147}{189215}You oughta be laying on your back.|You'll never walk.
{189219}{189311}Santa Anna didn't have much respect|for us today, and he got burned.
{189315}{189407}Now he's gonna be comin' at us|with a battle plan from all four sides.
{189411}{189526}We already been cut down by a third.|How long do you think we can hold out?
{189530}{189574}Santa Anna won't attack again today.
{189578}{189646}He'll clear the field of|all the dead and wounded.
{189650}{189718}Fannin will be here by tomorrow,|even without a forced march.
{189722}{189790}With his 500 men...
{189794}{189838}{y:i}...we can hold this fort for a month.
{189842}{189910}500? I thought it was a thousand.
{189914}{190006}500.|- Bonham's approaching, sir.
{190010}{190110}Good. Fannin should be close behind.
{190394}{190414}Well?
{190418}{190486}Colonel Fannin isn't comin'.
{190490}{190557}His men were ambushed. Murdered!
{190561}{190643}There won't be any help.
{190705}{190819}Have all volunteers|assembled in the compound.
{190921}{190965}Well, that's it.
{190969}{191037}I'm taking my men out.|Cut through to the North.
{191041}{191105}You comin'?
{191185}{191290}It seems like the better part of valour.
{191976}{192033}Men...
{192048}{192092}Jim Bonham has brought|news as sad as death.
{192096}{192188}Colonel Fannin has been ambushed.
{192192}{192272}We can expect no help.
{192288}{192376}I stay here with my command.
{192384}{192499}But any of you who wish to|may leave with all honour.
{192503}{192617}Failing reinforcements,|the Alamo cannot hold.
{192623}{192715}But do not go with heads hung low.
{192719}{192811}No man can criticise your behaviour.
{192815}{192899}Here on these ramparts...
{192911}{193027}{y:i}...you have bought a priceless|ten days of time for Houston.
{193031}{193099}You have bled the enemy army.
{193103}{193195}You are brave and noble soldiers.
{193199}{193267}Open the gate!
{193319}{193393}May God bless you.
{196220}{196290}Close the gate!
{196699}{196743}Hold up there, bub.
{196747}{196815}You're in dangerous territory.|Where you headin'?
{196819}{196911}I'm lookin' for General Sam Houston.|Got a message for him.
{196915}{196959}Well, you've come to the right place.
{196963}{197055}Corporal of the guard! Post No. 3!
{197059}{197127}What is it?|- He wants to see General Sam.
{197131}{197198}Come on, bub!
{197850}{197942}The lad has a message for the general.|- Yes, sir.
{197946}{198062}You'd better get down, and get yourself|some beans and a little sleep.
{198066}{198086}No, sir!
{198090}{198185}I've gotta get back to the Alamo.
{199001}{199069}Yesterday I read you Fannin's message...
{199073}{199189}...telling us he cannot reach|the Alamo in time.
{199193}{199293}Today I have this... from the Alamo.
{199337}{199381}They are surrounded...
{199385}{199477}{y:i}...and we can't help them.
{199481}{199524}Now, tomorrow...
{199528}{199659}{y:i}...when your recruits|start to whine and bellyache...
{199696}{199816}{y:i}...you tell them that 185 of their friends...
{199888}{199983}...neighbours, fellow Texicans...
{200008}{200124}{y:i}...are holed up in a crumbling adobe|church down on the Rio Bravo...
{200128}{200225}...buying them this precious time.
{200392}{200470}I hope they remember.
{200511}{200592}I hope Texas remembers.

{201902}{201946}I'm sorry.
{201950}{202011}What for?
{202022}{202090}I guess I've said some|pretty rude things to you.
{202094}{202185}Well, at least, I thought 'em.
{202190}{202234}You're a wonderful woman, Sue.
{202238}{202282}Forget it.
{202286}{202378}Dick, stay here as long as you can.
{202382}{202483}Probably won't need you till morning.
{202501}{202593}I've only added to your worries, haven't I?
{202597}{202688}I know I must be very selfish.
{202717}{202785}I couldn't think of facing|the world without you.

{203964}{204042}I'm just rememberin'.
{204132}{204224}Well, I sure done a heap of things|I shouldn't have done.
{204228}{204316}Seemed urgent at the moment.
{204324}{204416}Got myself a heap of sins to answer for.
{204420}{204488}Wish I hadn't did 'em.
{204492}{204607}I reckon old Saint Pete's gonna slam them|Pearly Gates right smack-dab in my face.
{204611}{204655}There ain't no Pearly Gates.
{204659}{204751}When you're dead, you're meat for|the worms. That's all there is to it.
{204755}{204823}You don't believe in no afterlife?|No hereafter?
{204827}{204919}Tales for children! Bunkum and bosh!
{204923}{204987}I say this.
{204995}{205039}I believe.
{205043}{205177}I can never find a way to argue down|you that don't believe.
{205187}{205255}But I believe in the Lord God Almighty...
{205259}{205351}{y:i}...all knowing and all forgiving.
{205355}{205471}And I believe that good|shall be triumphant in the end...
{205475}{205542}{y:i}...and that evil shall be vanquished.
{205546}{205614}I believe in a hereafter.
{205618}{205710}Me, too. I figure a man's|got to believe in those things...
{205714}{205806}{y:i}...does he want to believe in|the good things about man.
{205810}{205878}About his very own self.|The real good things.
{205882}{205969}Like courage and honesty...
{206002}{206063}And love.
{206122}{206180}Jethro!
{206218}{206279}Yes, sir.
{206482}{206586}This is somethin' I promised Mrs Bowie.
{206625}{206669}Know what it is?|- No, sir.
{206673}{206741}That's your freedom.
{206745}{206827}You're a free man, Jeth.
{206865}{206909}Thank you, sir.
{206913}{207029}You'd better get your belongings together|and get on over the wall tonight.
{207033}{207154}It's gonna be more than|a little rough around here.
{207273}{207317}Good luck, Jeth.
{207321}{207389}Thank you, sir.
{207393}{207461}Uh... Colonel Bowie,|you say I'm a free man?
{207465}{207508}That's right.
{207512}{207580}Well, if I'm free...
{207584}{207676}{y:i}...then I got a right|to decide what I'm gonna do.
{207680}{207796}Seems to me that's what|you men are fighting for.
{207800}{207880}So I... reckon I'll...

The beginning of a day.
September 7th, 1878.
It dawned like any other day
on the Cheyenne reservation...
... in that vast barren land
in the American Southwest...
... which was then called
Indian Territory.
But this wasn't just
another day to the Cheyenne.
Far from their homeland...
... as out of place in this desert
as eagles in a cage...
... their three great chiefs
prayed over the sacred bundle...
... that at last,
the promises made to them...
... when the white man sent them here
more than a year ago...
... would today be honored.
The promises that had led them
to give up their own way of life...
... in their own green and fertile country,
1500 miles to the north.
- Good morning, Wichowsky.
- Troops all present or accounted for, sir.
Thank you.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Can I steal some of your coffee?
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.
Any news?
Here comes another name now.
- Senator.
- Great.
Looks like we're gonna be up to our ears in congressmen.
Well, the more the better.
I wish every bigwig in Washington could see this place.
Deborah, they're here already.
Lord knows when the Congressional Committee will arrive.
I don't blame them for being early.
You and I know what this means to them, uncle.
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J...
...K., L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S,
T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
Wonderful.
Come help me set the table.
Attention!
- Scott.
- Good morning, sir.
- Sergeant.
- Good morning, sir.
- Archer.
- Good morning, sir.
- Indians, huh?
- Yep.
Any word from the Congressional Party?
They haven't left Fort Scott yet.
Well, let me know. Keep me advised.
Yes, sir.
Wichowsky, put the men at ease.
Let them smoke...
...if they've got anything to smoke, which I doubt.
At ease!
You're ready to smoke!
- Good morning, friend Thomas.
- Good morning, friend Deborah.
Well, now, where have you been hiding that dress?
That's pretty stylish for a Quaker.
I made it just for this great day.
It's mighty pretty.
Do you know when they'll arrive?
Well, you can't expect speed from congressmen...
...but they ought to be here any minute now.
Well, I'd offer to help you, but I can see you don't need it.
Oh, don't I, now?
Well, the leg on the senator's chair seems to be stuck.
Senator, huh?
Well, let's see what's wrong.
There we are.
All neat and tidy for the senator.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Anytime.
Friend Deborah, where do you want the senator's chair?
I think I'll put him at the head of the table.
He'd like that.
Plumtree, go down the road.
Let us know when those gentlemen from the East arrive.
Hour after hour
they waited under the hot sun.
Waited for the moment
when their prayer would be answered.
When the white chiefs from Washington
would see for themselves...
... how the Cheyenne
had been forgotten.
- Archer!
- Yes, sir.
When is that blasted party coming anyway?
- I don't know, sir.
- You don't know, sir.
- Hey, you.
- Sir.
Any news on that party from the East yet?
No. No, sir. Nothing since 11:30.
Eleven-thirty?
- Do you realize it's 5:30 now?
- Yes, sir.
Archer, see what he wants.
Plumtree.
I ain't a-getting paid for thinking, sir but I don't think them folks is a-coming.
Just came in from Fort Reno, sir.
I'll be damned!
"Congressional Committee delayed by bumpy roads and dust storms.
Decided to return to Reno in order to rest up for the Officers' Ball tonight."
You mean they're not coming here at all?
How long do they expect me to wait to build some barracks out here?
Archer, I'm going to Fort Reno, see to it.
Friend major, please...
...will you tell them about the medicine and the food the Indians need?
And all the things that were promised?
Uncle, you must make him listen.
How can I?
You know what he thinks of Quakers.
You've been here from the beginning.
You've watched them die of smallpox and measles and malaria.
You've watched them starve.
Haven't you anything to say?
Nothing that you can't say better.
Major Braden!
I'm asking you to plead for justice.
I'm asking you to make them realize...
...that over a thousand Cheyenne were brought here...
...and only 286 are left alive.
Miss Wright, my responsibility to the Indians is only to guard them.
When you have reached my age, you will have realized...
...that it pays to stick to your own knitting.
That's exactly what I intend to do.
Dull Knife! Little Wolf!
What happened today changes nothing.
The Indian Bureau is still pledged to provide you...
...with adequate clothing and rations.
You are still pledged to abide by the law.
Remember that.
We are asked to remember much.
The white man remembers nothing.
You spoke the truth for us.
This we will not forget.
But there will be no more school.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, please don't do that to the children.
The white man's words are lies!
It is better that our children not learn them.
It is not the words, but who speaks them.
Has speaking white men's words made you a liar?
Our words were learned long ago.
When some white men still spoke truth.
And so began, what to most people...
... must seem to be
only a footnote in history.
It ain't in my department, sir...
...but looks to me like them kids is a-playing hooky.
You're gonna be pretty lonesome, friend School Teacher.
No scholars.
They'll come.
When?
Spanish Woman!
Friend Deborah, leave this place.
Friend Thomas, you know
I came here to carry out a task.
I can't leave now.
Bunking in this schoolhouse won't help.
It will show them that I'm on their side.
Not unless you can change color.
You know what they call whites?
- And veho means "spider"!
- Means "spider"!
That's right.
- That's what they think of all of us.
- And why shouldn't they?
How many Cheyennes have you fought?
How many have you killed?
Deborah, look, will you take the blinders off just for once?
You claim no self-respecting Quaker could fall in love with a soldier...
...but you've fallen in love with a whole tribe of them.
Have you ever seen a Cheyenne?
- Of course, I have.
- No, you haven't!
All you've seen is reservation Indians, looking pitiful as fish out of water.
But give them a chance, they're the greatest fighters in the world.
Will you listen to me?
It takes a blue coat to make a white man a soldier.
But a Cheyenne is a soldier from the first slap on his bottom.
War is his life.
He's fierce, he's smart.
And he's meaner than sin.
Possibly you can only think of the past, but I'm here to think about the future.
All right.
You think of the future.
Want some help?
I'll manage.
Better keep that lamp lit tonight.
And if anything happens, ring the bell.
- Little Wolf.
- Yes?
- What's happened?
- This is not the place for you.
Spanish Woman...
...where are they going?
- Home.
- Home?
What you call Yellowstone country.
What about the children?
They are Cheyenne.
But who will care for them?
We will do what we can.
They are Cheyenne.
Dull Knife, the old chief is much too sick.
He'll never make such a trip.
Let...
If he lives to ride even a mile closer to home...
...he will die as a man should.
There will be no more dying in this place.
They've skipped.
Thank God.
What the hell do you mean by that?
I've waited since I was 10 years old for this chance.
Then you're a damned idiot.
I want D Troop ready and mounted in 10 minutes.
E Troop and wagons to follow under your command.
No artillery. Plumtree!
- Come here!
- Yes, sir!
E Troop and train reporting, sir.
You brought the wagons along too fast, Mr. Scott.
Draft animals can't stand it.
They can rest up tonight.
They can?
Well, that's an assumption you had no right to make.
We're gonna keep moving.
That's fine with me, sir.
- Scott, tell me something.
- Sir?
What put the blood in your eye?
It's just a private matter, sir.
Nothing that affects an officer's conduct is private.
My father died in the Fetterman Massacre back in '66.
Mother and I were at the fort when they brought his body in.
I was only 10 years old.
Until that time,
I never wanted to be a soldier.
Well, that doesn't give you a personal license to kill Indians.
The job of this Army is to keep the peace.
I understand, sir.
You do, huh?
Well, just make sure you understand...
...these Cheyenne broke no law when they left the Agency.
And they won't unless they cross the river.
So if you provoke trouble...
...I’ll see that you lose those shoulder straps...
...if I have to tear them off myself.
Understood?
Understood, sir.
Mr. Scott!
Sir?
I knew your father.
- Guide on!
- Sir.
Troop, halt!
Prepare to dismount!
Prepare to dismount!
Dismount!
- Sir!
- Yes.
Are you going to let them jump the reservation right bef?
They haven't jumped the reservation.
They haven't crossed the river yet.
- Sir, I most respectfully object to...
- Put it in writing.
Join your troop, mister.
Sir.
No. No, thanks.
Spanish Woman, what's happening?
I think war.
Spanish Woman, speak to Dull Knife.
He'll listen to you.
I can do nothing.
Nothing.
- School teacher.
- Little Wolf, you promised...
Take the children, join the others.
Troop, halt!
Troop, halt!
- Plumtree.
- Sir?
I don't like the look of it.
Take a look up that canyon.
- Yes, sir.
- Jones, you cover him.
Jones!
Name's Smith, sir.
Oh, well, go on up with him. Go on!
- All right?
- Yes, sir.
But that canyon there is plumb full of Indians.
- On ride into line! Yo!
- Hey, Smitty, wait a minute.
On ride into line! Yo!
You've got a lot to explain to a court martial, Archer.
Sergeant...
Cannon's ready?
Forward on the double!
Cannon forward on the double!
Prepare to dismount!
- Prepare to dismount!
- Dismount!
Now!
Motion!
All soldiers to the rear!
All soldiers to the rear!
Stop!
- Major, I've got to tell you...
- Go back to your troop.
...the majority of those people are women and children!
- Maybe 50 or 60 warriors.
- Archer, you're under arrest.
Number one gun, fire!
Number two gun, fire!
Fire number one.
Fire.
Cease firing!
Where's the major?
- Is he?
- Yes, sir.
They're angry because my son fired the first shot.
Does it ever matter who fires the first shot?
Those dirty, murdering...
- The major's dead, sir.
- Pick up the horses.
- I said, the major's dead, sir!
- Shut up!
Aren't you gonna give them a?
Plumtree, Brown, get the horses off the wagons.
- Yes, sir.
- Yo.
- Name's Smith, sir.
- All right, get to work!
My son says,
"The soldiers do not follow."
Dull Knife, you know the soldiers will have to follow us.
Have you thought what will happen to your wife and son?
There will be war.
- Little Wolf.
- These are my wives.
I pray the young one will give me sons.
But I want them to be born where I and all my people before me were born.
Even a dog can go where he likes...
...but not a Cheyenne.
You may go where you like.
No.
No.
No.
But...
The report
from the Army's field telegrapher...
... to headquarters in Omaha listed
only nine casualties incurred...
... in the troop's first encounter
with the homeward-bound Cheyenne.
But by the time it came off
the press in Kansas City...
... somehow it had
mysteriously grown to 29.
And suddenly it expanded
to 59, 69, 109...
... when the news reached
the tiny hamlets of the Western Plains.
Meanwhile, the Army was frantically
deploying troops along the 1200 miles...
... that still lay between the Cheyenne
and their homeland.
The railroads they had to cross
were patrolled.
River crossings watched.
The alarm was spreading
through the West.
Settlers crossing the plains
demanded Army escorts.
Or they rushed frantically
to the safety of Army posts.
No one asked how many Indians
had escaped.
The word Cheyenne was enough.
And in Washington heated words
echoed through the Halls of Congress.
The Department of the Interior
was crowded...
... with western railroad tycoons,
mine owners and land speculators.
All such people to whom Indian scares
meant lost dollars.
While the generals came
to fix the blame on Carl Schurz...
... the Secretary of the Interior.
In his misguided effort to eliminate
corruption in the Indian Bureau...
... it was Mr. Schurz who had brought
in the Quakers.
And to the Army
it was obviously the Quakers...
... who had encouraged
the Cheyenne to rebel.
In all the land there was not one voice
raised in behalf of the Cheyenne until...
In The Sun, the Times, Chronicle.
Take your pick. They're all saying the same things we're saying:
"Bloodthirsty savages on the loose.
Burning, killing, violating beautiful white women!"
It's not news anymore.
We're gonna take a different tack.
From now on, we're going to grieve for the noble red man.
We'll sell more paper that way.
Now, see to it!
But by now any rumor
could be believed.
Because suddenly the news
from the West had stopped.
The Cheyenne and their pursuers
had disappeared into the emptiness...
... and silence
of the thinly populated continent.
- Mr. Secretary.
- Come in. Come in.
Good afternoon, Mr. Secretary.
Now, no matter what you may have heard...
We assure you there's nothing personal about our proposed legislation.
The entire Senate has the greatest respect for you...
...you know that.
But all I know is that you're trying to snatch the Indian Bureau away...
...from my department and hand it over to the Army.
Mr. Senator?
Have you ever seen a Cheyenne?
An Arapaho? Any Indian?
Have you ever been west of the Mississippi River?
- What are driving at, sir?
- Well, just this.
Why are three eastern senators suddenly so concerned about Indians?
Well, it's strictly a matter of economy.
The Army has to be out there anyway.
Oh, so that's all it is.
I was afraid perhaps that some of the dollar patriots...
...who are sleeping on my doorstep might have been sleeping on yours.
Sir, are you questioning our honesty of purpose?
No more than I question theirs.
Their honest purpose is to grab every acre of land...
...the Indians once thought they owned.
You can't say that's Army policy.
Well, I can say it amounts to the same thing.
The smaller the reservations, the easier they are to guard.
You let the Army have its way...
...and they'll end up the size of postage stamps.
Exactly what the land-grabbers want.
We'll be late for that committee meeting.
- Excuse us, Mr. Secretary.
- Oh, Henry.
You and I fought together at Gettysburg...
...yet you'd never even seen a Negro slave.
All you ever knew...
...is that they were human beings with the rights of human beings.
And it was worth an arm to you.
Carl, I'll stall this legislation, but unless those Cheyenne are found soon...
...or if you make one false move,
God help you.
God help me.
Leave us.
When Little Wolf speaks veho words they are for my ears alone.
This I say:
We have always thought as one.
Never has the thickness of a straw come between us.
We still think as one.
As war chief...
...I may raise my hand only against the enemy.
We still think as one.
That is why
I must sleep with no wife...
...saving all my strength for a fight against the soldiers.
But your son...
...tries to steal my youngest wife.
This cannot be.
He is of my blood.
And my blood has never been bad.
He is of your blood...
...but he is not you.
Troop, halt!
Troop, halt!
Sergeant.
Mr. Scott.
Unlimber the guns!
If we attack,
I think we're in for a beating.
- Here's what I want...
- Their backs are to the wall!
And a lot of flat land to cross before we get there.
I'd rather force them to attack us.
- Well, they ain't done nothing foolish yet.
- I know.
- Take D Troop, get on their flanks.
- Sir.
Mr. Scott, dismount half of E Troop to protect the guns and wagons.
Then you move out with the rest to cover the right flank.
Yes, sir.
And remember, Mr. Scott...
...the trick to being brave is not to be too brave.
- Any questions?
- No questions, sir.
Right.
Plumtree, Murphy, take the point!
Take the point. Yo!
A little faster on there, come on.
Hurry up there.
You all right?
Well, yes, sir.
On left, to the line.
Forward at the walk. Yo!
Walk trot!
- What in the hell is that kid doing?
- As you were.
What the hell is he doing?
Canter!
Company, charge!
Mr. Scott!
Scott!
Damn you!
Front left, into line!
Yo!
Prepare to dismount.
- Get the guns out!
- They're at the wagons.
- Get the guns. Move!
- Yes, sir.
- Come on, move it.
- Come on.
- Get them out of there.
- Let's go.
Come on. Come on.
Get out of there.
Mr. Scott!
- I told you to cover that flank.
- I'm sorry, sir.
From now on, you don't scratch till I itch, is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Plumtree, Thompson.
Here, let me help.
Sir...
Despite the Indian scare,
an occasional cattle herd...
... still came up the Chisholm Trail
from Texas...
... to the railhead
in Dodge City, Kansas.
Sometimes the hungry Cheyenne...
... were able to pick up
a few stray cows.
And sometimes they even begged
for charity from the tough trailhands.
Yo, there.
Jessie, Homer, Shug.
Come here. Come here.
Hey, come on. Come here.
Slow down.
Lookit there.
Real blanket-head Injuns.
I sure would like to have me that little paint.
And I sure would like to kill me an Injun.
Can't you gut-eaters talk any Texican?
Yes, sir. I'd sure love to kill me an Injun.
I dare you, Homer.
- You dare me?
- I dare you.
I always wanted to kill me an Injun.
All them old-timers back home...
...a- hoorahing about how many scalps they've took.
Jessie, that's one of them there, one of them there Cheyenne.
We better skedaddle and get that herd out of here.
- Let's go.
- Not till I get my scalp, we won't.
G-O-O-D. Good.
G-O-O. Good.
G-O-O-D. Good.
Good.
Where are you taking my colt?
Let go of my colt!
My colt, my colt!
Always, they had to move through
unwanted and desolate country...
... where the chances of detection
and capture were fewer.
And there the land was poor
and wild game rare.
Always, hunger baited their heels
more fiercely than the soldiers.
What is it?
I don't understand.
A, B, C, D.
Buffalo.
Buffalo.
Do you remember what a buffalo looks like?
Soon, she will see one again.
Many, many.
Always, they come from the north.
Before the cold.
Always over same ground.
Then our bellies will be full again.
Bellies will be full and no longer will we be alone.
Our friends, the Dakota?
Sioux?
Will be coming south with the buffalo.
Always, it is so.
It's got to be soon.
Very, very soon.
And then in one tragic instant...
... after 500 miles
and many weeks of desperate flight...
... hope was gone.
The white hunters
had been there first.
Slaughtering the buffalo
not for food...
... but for hides.
The hungry Cheyenne
now stood alone.
Extra! Extra! Latest on the red devils.
Cheyennes attack settlers and massacre them!
Extra! Read all about it. Extra!
- Dog!
- Guinevere!
- Dog Kelly.
- Guinevere Plantagenet.
- Good to see you.
- Welcome to Dodge City.
- Ladies.
- Girls.
Come on, come on in.
Cards, gentlemen, if you please.
Ace.
King. And a jack. Ace bets.
- Check.
- Wait a minute.
How come you check with an ace showing?
Oh, was that an ace?
I'm blind as a bat.
Now, marshal, you can see right through to my ace in the hole.
- What's your ace worth, major?
- Check.
Five dollars for a start.
Call?
Call.
Card.
- Ace, deuce.
- Mingle, girls.
- Champagne here.
- Oh, no, no. Just a slug of rye.
Ace. Jack...
Say...
- Isn't that Wyatt Earp?
- Sure, over in the corner playing poker.
Excuse me, mayor.
- Miss Plantagenet.
- Major.
Now, there's a real royal name, gentlemen...
...and a noble lady.
- You bet 25 bucks?
- Dr. Holliday?
- Wyatt?
- Hi.
Last year, back in Wichita...
Don't do that. Don't do that.
Get your hands off the cards.
You thought this was the prettiest dress you ever saw.
Why, you couldn't take your eyes off it.
Yeah. That was when I was 10 high.
Now, I'm ace high.
- Doc, what do you do?
- I drop.
Would you like to join us, madam?
Madam?!
Are you gonna sit there and let this tin horn insult me?
- What kind of a marshal are you?
- Just you...
Doc Holliday, now come on, now apologize to the lady.
- I'll call.
- Forgive me, mademoiselle.
What the hell kind of talk is this?
Well, as I understand it, a mademoiselle is a madam...
...who ain't quite made it yet, only younger and friskier.
I'd call it a compliment.
- You're out, huh?
- Oh, you would, would you?
Our brave marshal!
Why, he won't even protect a lady from an insult.
Wyatt Earp.
You sure got a great way with women, Wyatt.
Yeah, the only trouble is, she thinks she knew me back in Wichita...
...and I just plain can't remember.
That makes for a very embarrassing situation.
All right, the deuces bet, bet the whole lot.
Hey!
How many men will this leave at the fort?
Oh, about a corporal's squad.
A corporal's squad?
Oh, don't worry, mayor, we'll cut them Indians down to our size.
Why, you can't leave this town unprotected like this.
Well, listen, I tell you
I'm gonna have your command...
We'll see you when we get back.
I tell you, I'm gonna write to Washington.
And when they get my letter...
...you can't leave a town like this unprotected.
Aren't horses in here a bit unusual?
What horses?
You betting or not?
Ten.
We're dry as a bone.
Bottle of bitters there.
You sound Texas.
We ain't heard any Texas around here for quite a while.
Extra! Extra! Latest in the Cheyennes.
Commit murder and pillage.
Extra! Extra! Eyewitness report.
- Cheyennes commit murder...
- What's you fellas' hurry?
You rushing for a train?
The fort.
We got a-plenty to tell them soldiers.
Plenty and then some.
You hear that? You're too late.
All but a corporal's guard has gone west to fight the Cheyenne.
What? Them damn fools.
Mister, we just fought off them murdering devils, southeast of here.
But we showed them how the cow eats the cabbage, didn't we, boys?
If you don't believe it, take a look at that.
After they killed poor Pete we was like the Lord and his avenging sword.
Injuns, huh?
Just southea... Well, Indians.
Wyatt.
Wyatt, you gotta listen to me.
Wyatt, you gotta listen to me!
Quiet down there. Shut up!
- What's he saying?
- Something about Indians.
You plan on putting up one of them wooden Indians out front?
That'd look real nice.
Give this place some tone.
Wyatt, listen. The Army's pulled out and we're all about to be massacred!
- That Wyatt...
- Wyatt Earp.
Yeah, I know.
- You know, that deck feels light.
- Don't look at me.
I sometimes decorate cards.
I never steal them.
Wyatt, have you read a paper in a week?
Well, just listen to this:
"Several herders murdered.
Farmhouses burned down.
Straggling bands of Indians raiding everywhere.
Immigrant trains robbed."
Wyatt. Wyatt.
- Over there are four Texans who just...
- That is light.
There are just 51 cards in that deck.
Are you claiming you can judge the weight of one single card?
- Count them.
- Wyatt.
- The fate of this city rests in our hands.
- Your hands.
- Strike me dead if there aren't 51.
- Let me see them.
Oh, it's not just the town, it's business.
Now, you all know that we depend upon them Texans...
...coming up here with wages in their pockets.
They haven't been coming up as much as they've been.
And if this kind of stuff keeps up, they won't be coming at all.
Bless my soul.
Fifty-one.
Now, major, you were the last one to shuffle that deck...
...and where's that card?
Every citizen of Dodge stands ready to go out...
Gentlemen, I swear, I didn't palm it.
- Major, where is the card?
- Wyatt...
If we shoot him, we won't have anyone left to play with.
- Gentlemen.
- It's a good point. A new deck.
Now, mayor, about all these things you read in the newspaper.
Now, did you ever in your whole life read anything true in that paper?
You calling me a liar?
Take a look at them apples.
Well, you fellas drove a herd up here, where is it?
We got them grazing about a mile outside of the town here.
Well, if you'd run into a flock of Cheyenne...
...your herd would be bulging in Cheyenne bellies by this time.
Then you are calling me a liar.
- Gentlemen, I open for 10.
- You gonna take that back or ain't you?
- I'll see that and I'll raise it.
- Answer me!
I don't give a damn if you are the best gunslinger in Kansas.
Take that back now!
- Ace checks.
- I'll bet 20.
I don't doubt your word.
I just question your eyesight.
You question my eyesight too, mister?
Kings say 20.
I'll up you 20.
Something smells of fish. I draw.
Wyatt, come on.
That's an order. You too, Holliday.
Are you still calling me a liar or ain't you?
I'd purely love to have your scalp too.
Now, Texas, you're just talking yourself straight into the calaboose.
Not me...
Your deal, marshal.
Wyatt! Wyatt!
That fella's bleeding all over the place, the bullet's still in his foot.
I seen you operate on a horse once and you gonna give him a hand.
It's awful noisy in here.
What about you?
- I'm out.
- You're out. And you?
- I raise.
- You raise. All right, I'll see you...
...and raise you 20.
- Oh, why did you shot him?
All right. A fella just wants a little friendly game of poker...
While you're thinking it over, major...
All right, come on.
Put him up on the bar.
Oh, no, Wyatt, not the bar!
He'll bleed all over it!
Take him outside.
Put him on his horse.
It's genuine mahogany, Wyatt!
Blood will stain it. Take him out, please!
- All right, put him up on the bar.
- No, not the bar. He'll bleed all over.
- Take him outside. Put him on his horse!
- Take me home!
- All right, shut up!
- This is genuine mahogany from St. Louis.
It's gonna stain.
Don't you cowpokes ever wear any socks?
I do. Occas... Every once in a while.
- Jessie.
- Put them down there.
- Here.
- Thank you. Thank you Miss?
- Plantagenet.
- Wichita, huh?
Thank you. Would you hold that bottle up, miss?
Hold it up high. Now you, I want you to keep your eye right on that bottle.
Don't even blink.
It's kind of like hypnotize.
Keep your eye right on, Homer.
Keep your eye right on the bottle.
You're not gonna even feel it.
Give me the bottle again.
One side, please.
What if that ash fell by mistake?
Wyatt might shoot you, by mistake.
There it is. Miss, may I?
All right, take him away.
Hey, wait a minute.
There you are. Good as new.
Hey, Dog, you missed one.
Hey, hey, come on, come on.
Come on. Get out.
Honest game.
Major, you have any news for me?
I know you're bluffing, Earp, I'm out.
Say, you're the doctor around here.
How come I always have to perform all the complicated operations?
You know I'm a dentist, not a doctor.
Wait till somebody shoots them in the teeth.
It's your deal.
Come on. Are you sure that's all there is in there?
Come on, men. Get it up here.
Go on out there. Load it up there.
Come on, get it out of the store, there.
Come on, men. Get it up here.
Mayor, what in the blazes are you doing?
Loading ammunition. What's it look like?
Come on, get it on there.
- Grant took Richmond with less than that.
- Well, it never hurts to be prepared.
Well, now, mayor, hold on.
I've just been thinking...
...seeing how you control all the gambling in this town...
...and I get 10 percent of the take...
...what would happen to my livelihood if you went out and got yourself shot?
So it behooves him to keep you at least 10 percent alive.
Mayor, why don't you go back to your office, take it easy...
...and just see that precious hide of yours don't get pierced by any foreign objects.
And the doctor here and me, we'll go forth and assume...
- Ladies and gentle...
- Get off of here. What the hell is that?
Marshal... I mean, field marshal, you got quite a motley army.
Colonel, he's here.
You know, there's Miss What's-Her-Name.
Say, say, miss. Where you going?
Following the flag, Mr. Earp.
Where the men go, we go.
I'd say that's quite understandable, Wyatt.
After all, the girls have to...
I know. I know. I know.
All right, sergeant.
Blow your horn.
General, do you mind confiding your plan of campaign to your chief of staff?
Not at all. Not at all.
From which direction are these blood-thirsty
Cheyenne savages approaching?
Southwest, of course.
And in which direction are we headed?
Northeast.
That's my plan of campaign.
Have a beer, ma'am.
There they are. Indians! Indians!
Doctor, as a Christian gentleman,
I am opposed to profanity.
- But let's get the hell out of here?
- Right.
Help!
Hey, grab that Miss What's-Her...
Help!
Grab her, Doc.
Grab her. Don't let her get away.
Come on, grab...
By golly, I did know her in Wichita.
And so ended
the battle of Dodge City.
Casualties: one silk dress.
- Essex, sir.
- Archer.
- Coffee, sir?
- Coffee.
Here's the answer to your message, sir.
- Help yourself.
- Thanks.
- Important?
- Usual thing.
No reinforcements available.
Well, didn't you tell them your company's in no shape to fight?
Yes, sir, I told them we're all scattered up and down the line.
I haven't even seen the captain in two days.
There've been too many of these false alarms.
We'll have to wait until we can swear we saw them trying to cross the tracks.
- lf they haven't crossed already.
- They can't have done that.
Nobody could, not even a rabbit could get through.
You're not talking about Cheyenne.
Well, tomorrow come sunup I'm sending out my own patrols, both sides of the river.
With 900 miles still to go
to reach their northern home...
... the Cheyenne suddenly faced
a hazard they had never heard of.
The long line of steel rails
were as the bars of a prison.
Well, what do you think you're doing?
Have a snort.
Where the hell did you get that?
- See that nice, shiny boot?
- Yeah.
Captain What's-His-Name is an infantry officer.
A doughfoot.
Now, why do infantry officers need nice, shiny boots?
I'll bite, why?
To hide whiskey bottles in.
Look, sergeant.
You sober up and be ready to move out when I give you the word...
...or you're Mr. Wichowsky.
Sonny?
Sonny.
It's plain to see you ain't the officer you used to be.
- No.
- Or you'd know my enlistment expired...
...as of 10 days ago.
Thirty years.
Thirty years and 10 days.
Thank you. Thank you.
You're talking to Mr. Wichowsky.
So climb off that high horse...
...and drink me a little toast.
No, no.
You climb off your high horse and you get ready to sign this.
You're re-enlisting as of right now.
- Oh, no, I ain't.
- Oh, yes, you are.
- You wanna know why?
- Why?
- I'm a Pole.
- Really?
You know what they have in Poland besides Poles?
- What have they got?
- They've got Cossacks.
- You know what a Cossack is?
- What?
A Cossack is a man on a horse...
...with a fur cap on his head and a saber in his hand.
Now he kills Poles just because they're Poles.
Like we're trying to kill Indians just because they're Indians.
I was proud to be an American soldier.
But I ain't proud to be a Cossack.
Wichowsky, you've fought Indians before.
I fought Indians who wanted to fight me.
Not just some poor, starving blanket-heads trying to go home!
All right, Mr. Wichowsky.
Did you say you had a drink for me?
Well, sure, Tom.
Thank you very much, Stanislaus.
See you around.
Hey, doughfoot, seen any Indians around?
They must've skedaddled when they heard you manure-spreaders was coming.
"Manure-spreader."
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, Smitty, can you read?
Well, sure I can read.
And write.
"Deborah Wright.
Her book."
- Sir.
- Yes?
- Sir, we...
- Well, speak up, Murphy.
We found this in the river.
Means they've crossed.
What, sir?
- Trumpeter. Boots and saddles.
- Sir.
Good luck, sir.
Well, good morning, Mr. Wichowsky.
Sergeant Wichowsky, sir, reporting for duty.
- Sign me in.
- Sign it yourself. I'm busy.
Troop forward at the canter. Yo!
And so the pursuit continued...
... across changing terrain
and changes of season...
... the pursuers sometimes almost
as hungry and exhausted as the pursued.
Halt! Who goes there?
Mr. Scott!
Well.
Lieutenant Scott reporting for duty, sir.
Did the surgeon release you?
I slipped away, sir.
And how about this government horse?
Well, he slipped away too, sir.
I see.
- You know something, Mr. Scott?
- What, sir?
You might make a soldier after all.
- Well, thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.
- Wichowsky.
- Sir.
- Boots and saddles.
- Boots and saddles?
- Boots and saddles.
- Boots and saddles.
What's the matter, sir?
Fort Robinson is near here.
- lf we go there...
- You are saying...
...there is no hope of victory.
We will die before we reach our homeland.
There was hope in your heart when we started.
Where has it gone?
Maybe the hunger clawing at our bellies...
...has clawed my hope away too.
Why was I given this?
Why?
To lead our people home.
If we go on, the children will die.
If we go to Fort Robinson...
...you will speak for us?
Yes, of course.
The straw has come between us.
Yes.
Now our people must choose...
...who they want to follow.
And so in the grim north
of Nebraska...
... with less than 700 miles to go...
... and over 800 miles
of pain and hunger behind them...
... the Cheyenne nation broke apart.
Off to your right, now.
Off to your right.
That way.
- Cheyenne, sir.
- Good. Good. Feed them.
Find shelter for them.
And give them good fire.
Make them comfortable.
Sir.
Yeah, yeah.
This will make me a major.
Would you be pulling the curtain?
That must have been a terrible, terrible journey.
Well, it's exhaustion and malnutrition.
Oh, it's a horrible leg altogether.
But we'll feed her and keep her warm.
And I'm afraid, after a while,
I'm going to have to operate.
I wish...
I wish I were a better doctor.
Captain Archer, sir.
Captain Oskar Wessels.
Well.
There are your Cheyenne.
Yeah, yeah.
You are right, Captain Archer.
Fenimore Cooper knew little about Indians...
...but his books first made me interested in them.
Here.
Half the volumes you see here are about Indian life...
...and culture, though no one else will read them.
Captain Wessels neglects to mention that most of them are written in German.
So, captain, you don't believe that the Indian should be wiped off...
...the face of the earth along with the buffalo?
Nein, no, of course not.
Miss Wright, it has been much too long...
...since we could enjoy a lady's presence.
Here... Does cigar smoke bother you?
Friend Captain, I'm so happy to be warm and comfortable...
...that nothing could bother me.
Yes?
Excuse me.
Headquarters, sir. Urgent.
Stand by.
"Omaha.
Cheyennes are to be kept under restraint...
...and then returned south as soon as escort troop has arrived."
But they surrendered voluntarily.
Oh, this is simply a military routine.
They escaped from a reservation...
...and are to be returned there.
- Murder's not routine.
These people could never survive that march in the dead of winter.
Excuse me.
Captain Archer, I feel as you do, but this is an order.
An order.
- Mr. Peterson.
- Sir?
Warehouse is empty, we can put them there.
Captain, the fort area is restraint enough.
Where can they even try to go in this weather?
This order came to me and to me is the responsibility.
I can take no chances.
You claim to be a doctor.
You gonna let him put those women and children in a warehouse at 10 below zero?
What are you gonna do about it?
What are you gonna do about it?
As ordered, sir.
Orders are orders.
Well, this time we ain't the Cossacks.
Well?
I'm commander of this post.
All messages must be cleared through me.
I read your report, captain.
It doesn't begin to give a picture of this situation.
Well, one must be tactful with higher authority.
- Would you have me call them "fools"?
- No.
I'd have you tell them the truth.
They have given me an order.
An order.
I questioned it once, it will not be questioned again.
Accept no more messages from this officer.
He'll accept this one because you can't refuse to allow it.
I have a month's leave.
I'm requesting two weeks of it.
Why? Why at this time?
I'm not required to tell you why.
- Lock the door.
- Lock the door?
- I said, lock the door!
- Sir...
Never mind!
You, Dull Knife.
You and your people will be prepared to start south in the morning.
We will not go back.
You have no other choice.
If you try to force us...
...first I die.
We will not go back.
Who in here speaks English?
Besides this? This chief?
Yes?
You?
Yes.
You will tell your people...
...that I've tried to get the order delayed until spring.
But the order stands.
However...
...I will provide additional wagons for the sick and feeble.
And you will further tell them that their chief...
...this chief is brave, but no longer wise.
They must obey just as I obey.
They will not go back.
Life there is not life.
They will die here.
Authority must and will be obeyed.
They will die here.
There will be no more food, no more water.
And...
And no more firewood...
...until they change their minds.
They will not go back.
- Hello.
- Hello, captain.
- She's not gonna lose her?
- No, no. Not at all.
Not at all.
You know,
I was a good surgeon once.
See that?
I haven't had a drink in a week.
- Amazing.
- God's truth.
- Take a look at himself, will you?
- Hello, Scott.
Hello, sir.
Aye, just pneumonia, all right.
But he's young and strong, thanks be to God, so he got over it.
- I'm throwing him out tomorrow.
- Good. He'll be on his feet in no time.
Now, what's this, huh?
T-R...
- A.
- A.
- I.
- I.
- N.
- N.
- Train.
- Train.
That's good. That's very good.
Bye, honey.
- Good luck, Scott.
- Good luck to you, sir.
I'll need it.
You're going away?
I hope you'll be here when I get back.
T-R-A-I-N.
Miss Wright, if you please.
I hope you know what you're doing, sir.
- Let's go.
- Smith, sir! Giddap.
Yes?
I was told the secretary wanted to see me.
Were you also told that the secretary is a very busy man?
Well, sir, I am also a very busy man.
And what is your name?
Archer. Captain Archer.
I do not see the name of a Captain Archer on the list...
Look, sir, I have to get back to Fort Robinson.
Fort Robinson?
I've been wanting to meet someone from Fort Robinson.
- Come with me.
- Thank you.
Gentlemen, gentlemen. Please.
Come in.
- Captain Archer, aren't you?
- Yes, that's right.
This is my hideout.
This is where I keep away from the leeches and vultures upstairs...
Excuse me, but I have an appointment with Mr. Schurz.
- The secretary judge...
- I'm Carl Schurz. Cigar?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I didn't recognize you.
Nobody does. Sit down, sit down.
Oh, thank you.
Captain.
I understand you're quite unpopular over at the War Department.
For what purpose?
Is that why you wanted to see me, sir?
I'm not supposed to discuss this outside of channels.
Well, if it concerns the Indians at Fort Robinson, I'm the channel.
I'd like to know why you're risking your career...
...your commission by questioning superior authority.
I'd like to know, confidentially, the truth.
I don't often manage to hear it.
Well, sir.
At Fort Robinson, I've seen respect for superior authority...
...gone stark-raving mad.
Those Indians are dying of cold and starvation in that prison.
I only heard they were being, what's the word? "Restrained"?
- "Disciplined"?
- No, sir.
"Murdered" is the right word.
And you'd like me to do something about it?
Sir, I only know what those Cheyenne have gone through.
If the people had seen it, they wouldn't have liked it.
The people?
Captain...
...you're asking me to make that false move...
...that a lot of people have been hoping for.
They need your help, sir.
There's a train at 7 this evening for the West. You'll be on it.
Thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.
Old friend.
Old friend.
What would you do?
They sound like a thousand banshees out there...
...keening over the grave of Choochoolan.
Young lady, you don't seem to realize what you're asking of me.
You know the Army is the only living that I have.
Now you listen to me for a minute and I'll explain it to you.
Look, when I was studying medicine on the Continent...
...it was read a book, look at a corpse and say, "Thank you for the license."
Well, the Civil War changed all that.
Civil War was my salvation.
I stepped right off a boat and straight into uniform...
...and I had a good sense to stay there.
Now, all I've done ever since is hand out blue pills...
...and give doses of castor oil.
Man alive, I...
Look, I starved to death in civilian practice...
- You use the word lightly.
- "Lightly"? I...
I think the Cheyenne are starving now.
Now listen to me, Miss Wright.
You're a Quaker and you're dedicated to self-sacrifice...
...while I'm dedicated to self-preservation.
You want me to go out there, don't you?
Yeah, and take me future, me career and me pension...
...and throw it down the drain.
Is that what you want, huh?
Yeah, well, that's exactly what I'm going to do.
Captain, you've got trouble on your hands.
Trouble?
How can there be trouble?
They have nothing to fight with.
- Their bare hands, maybe.
- "Bare hands."
The question is, do you want to be responsible?
Responsible?
I am responsible for nothing.
None of them had to die.
They could've walked out of there any time they liked.
I have simply been the instrument of an order.
An order I did not agree with.
You say that as if you've memorized it.
Why? Why do you talk to me?
Why don't you talk to those Indians?
That is where the blame is.
Any time.
Any time they could've ended this.
First, it was the order from headquarters.
Now, it's the Indians.
Everybody is to blame but you.
I will not stand for any more insubordination...
- The truth of the matter is that you've...
- Get out!
...let this become a test of wills between you and the Cheyenne.
You have made it your own personal fight.
You are a liar.
You lie!
Nothing I have done is personal.
I am a soldier.
I was a soldier in Prussia, and I am a soldier here.
All my life, I have given and taken orders.
What would be this world without orders, huh? What would be?
Chaos. Anarchy.
That's what would be.
Well, I will not let that start here.
And you...
You. You, oh...
I will not let you spread these lies.
You are under arrest.
Gentlemen!
Mr. Peterson.
Lieutenant Peterson, bear witness.
I have just arrested this man.
You are mistaken, captain.
I am not under arrest, but you are.
The regulations state that when an officer...
- Yeah, I know the regulations...
- "Due to alcoholism...
- "Alcoholism"?!
...brain injury or kindred disability...
...is not capable of command...
- What did you see in this?
...he may be removed."
I am doing just that.
You are the one with brain disease, not me.
I am doing just that, sir.
- You'll be court-martialed and shot!
- These men are my witnesses...
...but I am assuming full responsibility.
You are confined to quarters.
- Quarters?
- Officer of the day, the keys, please.
Mr. Peterson, I am taking full responsibility.
Enemy! Enemy!
On the double! On the double!
Come on!
Oh, glory be to God.
Back to work!
Stop it, you idiots! Stop it!
Has authority been sufficiently obeyed, sir?
As if guided by the instinct
of a wounded animal...
... the survivors of the Cheyenne
joined together 1200 miles...
... from the territory they had fled...
... at a place in the arid hills of Dakota
which they held sacred...
... called, in their language,
"Victory Cave."
Cavalry in position, sir.
Colonel, I'd like to have you meet the Secretary of the Interior, Carl Schurz.
Well, I'm glad to see you,
Mr. Secretary.
Riding all night didn't help my lumbago.
- Is that coffee I smell?
- Yes, sir. Oh, Captain?
- Archer, sir.
- Archer.
Thank you.
- You see those guns, Mr. Secretary?
- Yes.
Well, in just about one minute now, sir...
Yes, I know, I know.
You're all set.
But not before I've had a chance to talk to those Indians.
Well, now this is hardly a civilian matter, Mr. Secretary.
Army coffee hasn't improved in all these years.
I have my orders from General Sheridan, sir.
One question, colonel.
Do you enjoy killing Indians?
Women, children?
- Well, no, of course, sir, but I have...
- Then you'll be pleased I came.
- The orders have been changed?
- The ground that you're standing on...
...is property controlled by the Department of the Interior.
Now, I either parley with those Cheyennes...
...or I consider you and your troops trespassers.
Well, that's absurd, Mr. Secretary.
Colonel, I know I may be on shaky legal ground...
...but that's for the courts to decide.
- You ever had lumbago?
- No, sir, I've... But...
Little Wolf, Dull Knife, this is Mr. Schurz...
...one of the chiefs of our government in Washington.
- They both speak English, sir.
- Oh, good. Good.
I know how many promises have been made to you and then broken.
But I'm not here to make any promises.
I'm asking you to take a gamble.
All veho words are the same.
You keep us talking.
- The soldiers...
- Now, please listen to me. Please.
You've made one of the most heroic marches in history.
You deserve to go back to your homeland and stay there in peace.
I'm sure that the people of this country will understand and will agree...
...when they hear the facts.
Now will you take the gamble?
The people? Who will tell them?
Who will tell the people about Fort Robinson?
I will.
I promise you.
You call this "Victory Cave."
You can have another greater victory here, right now.
He speaks the truth.
We have no...
Tobacco.
No tobacco for the peace pipe.
Maybe we can start a new custom.
Thank you.
But there were still wounds to heal...
... and there was still peace to be made
among those who had lived...
... through the long, heroic march.
And there were still some who had
yet to come home...
... to the land of the Cheyenne.
And so when the nation was safe...
... the sacred bundle, symbol of the chief
of chiefs, was passed on...
... for no one could carry it who had shed
the blood of another Cheyenne.
Home.
H-O-M-E, home.
H-O-M-E, home.
Suit yourself.
Get on your feet.
Do like I tell you.
Now get on that mule before he decides to use that Winchester.
All right, lady, what's your name?
- Mrs. Lowe. Nancy Lowe.
- From Lordsburg?
- Yes.
- I should have known.
Mind gathering some sticks, ma'am?
No, not at all.
Now, that's gonna be kind of hard to do, sitting up there.
Mr. Cody, you said you should have known who I was.
What did you mean by that?
A month ago, Comanche jumped your coach halfway to Lords, butchered the whip and shotgun and took you alive.
I suppose most everybody around here knows about that.
Then my husband didn't send you for me?
No, ma'am.
- Well, how...
- Talked to a tame Indian up Casa Verde way.
Said the Comanche were holding a white woman. Holding her for trade.
- So you came after me?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why?
- Seemed like a good idea.
You could have been killed.
Yes, ma'am.
Come morning, we'll swing south.
Two days will put us into Lordsburg.
Good night, Mrs. Lowe.
If you'd had a woman taken by the Comanche and you got her back, how would you feel, knowing...
If I loved her, it wouldn't matter.
- Wouldn't it?
- No, ma'am. It wouldn't matter at all.
Comanche Station.
Station man likely rode the eastbound to Casa Verde.
Doubled back on the Lordsburg run.
I'll grain and water the animals.
Mr. Cody, I could take the stage on to Lordsburg from here.
I've been enough trouble.
I started taking you back to Lords, and that I full intend to do.
Much obliged, Cody.
We needed that extra gun.
Dobie! Get up on that rise.
Make sure them devils don't lay out in the weeds and wait till dark to come killing.
Yes, sir.
Frank!
Yeah.
You the station man's woman?
This here is Mrs. Lowe.
Well, now, how about that?
Hey, Frank, this here is Mrs. Lowe.
We've been looking this country clear over for you.
- You've been looking for me?
- Yes, ma'am.
Just about every man in the territory's been out beating the brush.
You've got a worth, Mrs. Lowe.
Ain't that right, Frank?
Might of figured you'd beat me to it, Cody.
Frank, better catch up to your partner, and you and him drag them dead Indians up on that hill with you.
Do like he says.
- Lane.
- Hello.
- Those bucks, they had paint on.
- So?
Couldn't be you're carrying Comanche hair on those mules, could it?
We ain't scalp hunters, Cody.
You know that.
Do I?
You'd do anything for bounty.
Look, me and the boys rode in to Ransom Canyon, same as you did.
Thought Mrs. Lowe here was still up for trade.
They come at us and we run.
It was worth a try, though.
Ain't every day a man gets a chance to make that amount of money.
Don't you know how much your husband is offering the man who brings you back, Mrs. Lowe?
Didn't he tell you?
Can't say as I blame him.
Pure shame you beat me to her, Cody.
Yes, sir, pure.
I've heard about men like you.
Comancheros, I think they call them.
Well, it won't be necessary for you to take me on to Lordsburg.
And I'll see to it my husband pays you your bounty.
- Now, hold on to him, boys.
- We got him.
All right, here goes.
That liniment will do it.
Get him, Dobie.
Oh, get away from me, you mule!
Come on! Come on, Dobie, grab him!
I'm trying!
That's it, Dobie, don't be scared of him.
Hold him, Dobie!
He don't seem hurt too bad.
The bullet just creased his hide.
Nothing like jackass liniment.
That'll cure anything.
Been a long time, Cody.
- Last time I seen you was...
- Fort McKavett.
That's right.
The day you busted me out of the army.
I never could figure why.
Killing Indians, that's what we were there for.
Was it?
Seems like we've been over this before.
I heard you'd given up the critter soldiers.
I kind of figured you'd stay with it, being a major and all.
Command was wiped out at McKavett.
Yeah, I know.
- Least they can't blame me for that.
- Can't they?
I was doing my job!
You overran a village of tame Indians.
- I didn't know.
- You're a liar.
That's what you said at my court-martial, didn't you?
Had my way, they'd have hung you.
You said that, too.
"Overland Stage.
"The Lordsburg run leaves...
"Overland Stage, the Lordsburg run leaves
"Casa Verde, sunrise.
"Team change Comanche Station, sunset.
"Weather...
"Weather permitting."
I didn't know you could read, Dobie.
Well, I ain't much with books and newspapers, but plain words, you know, like signs and wrappers and such, I do pretty good.
Which one's Comanche?
Right there.
Dang!
You planning on taking the coach to Lords, are you, Mrs. Lowe?
Yes, I am.
Wouldn't suppose you'd hold kind to that, Cody.
The lady here says she's going to take the coach to Lords.
I'm not a prisoner anymore, Mr. Lane.
Aren't you?
- Lane.
- Hello.
There's plenty of light left.
If you were to leave now, you could cover a good amount of ground before night.
We say anything about going anywhere, did we?
- I didn't.
- No close town around.
Now that's a fact.
Nothing but empty between here and Lords.
No, I think we'll stay around for a while.
Me, I get a kick out of watching that coach come in, waving to the people.
Don't you, boys?
That is unless you have any objections, Mr. Cody.
I don't really see that it's any of his business.
Now, you took the words right out of my mouth.
- Mr. Lane.
- Yes, ma'am?
That stage should have been here by now, shouldn't it?
The driver likely saw war signs, laid over the night at Casa Verde.
I see.
Your husband is a fortunate man, getting you back.
I guess you'll always wonder, though, why he didn't come after you himself.
I don't mean to low-grade him, mind you.
After all, he did put up $5,000.
That's love of a sort, I suppose.
Were you mine,
I'd come looking to find you even if I had to die in the doing.
Good night, Mr. Lane.
That stage don't get here come morning, me and the boys'll be obliged to see you to Lordsburg.
She's something, ain't she?
Did you mean that, Ben, about us taking her on into Lords?
Why not?
Cody won't like that.
Country's crawling with Comanche.
He's gonna need all the help he can get.
He ain't about to give up that 5,000.
That's right.
We could kill him.
Did that, that woman would witness against us. Ain't that a fact, Ben, huh?
If she was alive.
What?
They said that Mr. Lowe fellow...
They said he'd be willing to pay even if a man brought his wife in dead.
Why would he do a fool thing like that?
Claims just knowing for sure would ease his loss.
- Well, that's crazy.
- That's the way he looks at it.
You mean, the woman?
That's a lot of money.
I heard what Lane said about your husband.
He's wrong.
Rode out to find you, he'd have likely got you both killed.
- Is that all, Mr. Cody?
- No, ma'am. That...
That money offered to get you back, I...
I suppose you're going to tell me that you didn't know anything about that.
I didn't know.
I don't believe you.
I didn't think you would.
Frank?
Were you awake?
Yeah.
Frank, you ever get the feeling we ain't along?
Well, with Ben.
What?
Well, the way he treats us.
You know, "Do this, do that."
He says, "Jump," and we say, "Which way?"
So?
So, we might as well not even have a head.
Well, if you want to ride, Dobie, you can go. Ben's not gonna stop you.
You come along, too, would you?
You mean break with Ben?
No, I guess not, huh?
Well, it's nothing personal, it's just that a man sort of gets used to a thing.
Sure hope I amount to something.
What?
My pa, he used to say,
"Dobie, no matter what you do
"or who you do it to,
"be sure you amount to something."
Well, what did he mean by that?
Oh, a lot of things.
Like what?
Well, like Cody.
- Cody?
- He does.
He does what?
Amount to something.
How do you know?
Well, he was Army. Had braid on him.
Yeah, but not anymore, he hasn't.
That don't matter. A man does one thing, one thing in his life he can look back on, go proud.
That's enough.
Anyway, that's what my pa used to say.
He talked all the time, didn't he?
Yeah.
He was a good man.
Sure is a shame.
Shame?
Yeah, my pa, he never did amount to anything.
Good night, Frank.
What do you think, Ben?
I think we ought to get out of here.
- Cody.
- I see them.
- Dobie.
- Yes, sir?
Go catch up the animals.
We'd better get on to Lords before they decide to scald us out.
We'll wait for the stage from Casa Verde.
If that was coming, it would have been here by now.
Frank's right.
They might have got cut off, forted up at some swing stop along the way.
You sure you don't have scalps on those mules?
You think I'd do something like that?
- I know you would.
- Look, Cody, I...
Ben! Man coming out here!
Stage turned back to Casa Verde.
Had to get back. Take care of my...
Take care of my animals.
Scalp-hunters raided a village up near Mesa.
Killed the women and small ones.
They caught them.
Caught them?
Yeah. Two no-goods from Verde, killed them both.
That didn't stop the Comanche, though.
Been butchering the territory one end to the other.
You'd better head and clear out.
Go on to Lordsburg before...
My horse.
Gotta take care of my horse...
We'll take care of him.
Frank, give Dobie a hand.
We're all going to Lords.
It's amazing what an Indian will give up for a Winchester rifle and a bolt of red calico.
Mrs. Lowe, she's sure a handsome woman.
See one like that, a man gets to thinking about taking a wife and settling down.
You?
Well, I admit, I never had much luck when it comes to women.
Oh, I've run with a few.
Nothing you could call serious.
Except maybe that little gal down in Sonora.
She said right out she loved me.
Wanted to marry me.
Told everybody. Everybody but her husband.
Oh, he came within that of doing me with a scattergun.
That taught me a lesson, though.
Always check the brand to make sure you ain't driving another man's stock.
- Lane.
- Hello.
Back there at the station, what I said about your mules carrying Comanche hair, I...
Forget it.
Everybody's entitled to a mistake.
Now, you take that there Mr. Lowe.
Offering all that money to get his wife back, that's a mistake.
That amount of money has a way of making a man go all greed inside.
Such as?
Makes them get to thinking of doing things he might not otherwise do.
You know, it's a long way to Lordsburg.
It wouldn't surprise me if somebody didn't try to take that woman away from you.
Like you, for instance?
Like me, in particular.
Wait here.
Come on across.
- Come on.
- Dobie, straighten out those horses.
Come on, come on, let's get going.
We'll follow the river as far as we can.
That'll put us a full day out of the way.
If you're in a hurry, you can travel open country.
Nobody's stopping you.
We'll ride along with you.
Figured you would.
Better slip into this.
Couple of more miles, you'll be plumb out of that.
Mr. Cody, I think I owe you an apology.
No matter the reason, you did save my life.
Hadn't been me, it would've been somebody else.
Lane told me you've brought more whites out of Comanche country than any other man in this territory.
Why, Mr. Cody?
They traded you for $5 worth of goods and a Winchester, Mrs. Lowe.
Figure it out for yourself.
We'll be staying here long enough to grain the animals.
And if you've a mind to wash, there's a hole back around the bend of the river.
Sure is a waste.
Having to do the woman.
If she was only ugly, it wouldn't be so bad, but pretty like she is, it's an out and out waste.
Maybe we won't have to.
I don't see any other way.
We could string along with Cody till after he gets the money,
- and then we could...
- It won't work.
Why not?
Well, because that'd be just asking for a hang rope.
We're gonna have to do him in, anyway.
And everybody's going to think the Comanches got him.
I never thought of that.
I still don't like it.
My folks brought me up to be kind to a woman.
You know, "Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am."
Open doors for them, give them my chair.
Not go around killing them.
Well, you think I like it any better than you do?
- No, I guess not.
- You wanna go to work, do you?
- Work?
- Making an honest living?
Oh, no, I don't think I could do that.
- I'd cowboy some.
- Well, what will that get you?
You work yourself to death for somebody, and likely they have to take up a collection to bury you.
Frank!
- Ain't that pretty?
- Yeah.
Frank, take a ride up river and see if they crossed ahead of us.
If they cut our track, it's gonna put us between a rock and a hard place.
You can say that.
- How long is that woman gonna take?
- Sit down. She'll be back in a minute.
Frank! Frank!
We're getting out of here.
- You're not going to leave him like that?
- Yes, ma'am.
That ain't right, Mr. Cody.
Not talking about right, talking about staying alive.
I'll turn those stage horses loose.
They can take care of themselves from now on.
Mr. Cody, you can't leave here until we give that man a proper grave.
You want to end up again belonging to a Comanche buck?
We'll rest here.
We'll turn Frank's horse loose.
He'll eat his way to Lordsburg.
Yes, sir.
A saddle and a shirt.
That's all Frank had.
- Sure ain't much.
- Sure ain't.
- Wasn't his fault, though.
- No?
No.
He never knew anything but the wild side.
Man can cross over any time he has a mind.
It ain't that easy. It ain't that easy at all.
- How old are you, Dobie?
- I don't know. Young.
Family know you're running loose in this country, do they?
No, sir.
Fever got them.
Nobody to answer to, so you threw in with the likes of Lane.
Me and Frank were riding together up near DeValdie way.
Frank was alone, same as me.
We heard about this fellow who was looking for some young guns.
Been with him ever since.
You'll end up on a rope, Dobie.
You know that?
- Yes, sir.
- You could break with him.
I've thought about that.
I've thought about that a lot.
Frank said it.
A man gets used to a thing.
Dobie, when we get to Lordsburg, you can ride along with me a ways.
A man gets tired being all the time alone.
- You'd do that for me?
- Think it over, son.
Hold it. It's only me.
Get down to the river, Dobie.
- You see anything, sing out.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
- Ben?
- Hello.
We get to Lords, we ought to see if we can hunt up some of Frank's kin.
They should be told.
Yeah, we'll do that.
I'm sure gonna miss...
Miss him.
That Dobie kind of runs on the gentle side, don't he?
Maybe too gentle.
For what?
This is a hard country, Cody.
Man's called on to do a lot of things.
Things that take spine.
Like Mrs. Lowe's husband.
It took a lot of nerve to send another man out to bring his woman back.
No, I mean it.
How does he know what's gonna happen, throwing two together like that?
I knew me a fellow once, wife was taken in a raid.
A good-looking woman.
Kind of made you go lonely just being around her.
Hearing her say words.
Seeing her move.
Come to think of it, she's a lot like you, Mrs. Lowe.
Anyway, he lost her and he sent a gent out to find her and he did.
Of course, at first, they didn't get on too good, her thinking he'd traded her for a profit and him making out like he don't care this way or that.
Now, all the time, they're getting closer and they never even knew it.
About the second night out, she got to thinking on it.
Got to feeling all grateful inside.
What with this fellow risking his hide to save her while her own man stayed home, doing who knows what.
- Well, the next thing you know...
- Lane.
I was only gonna say that, that husband never did get his woman back.
Now losing them to a Comanche, that's one thing.
Losing them to a white, that's something altogether else.
'Course, in this case, there's the money.
Sure would put a man to the test having to decide between you and $5,000, Mrs. Lowe.
I'm sure glad it ain't me.
- Lane.
- Hello.
Any luck, we'll break out of Comanche country sometime tomorrow.
- That happens, I want you gone.
- Now, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Then you could have Mrs. Lowe here all to yourself.
Mr. Cody.
- It wasn't necessary to do that for my sake.
- I didn't.
Hi. I couldn't sleep.
I'm glad.
Nothing as lonely as the night.
- Dobie...
- Yes, ma'am?
- How long have you known Cody?
- Since Comanche Station.
You didn't know him at all before that?
No, ma'am. Not face on.
I'd heard about him.
How he's all the time alone, all the time in Comanche country, looking.
Seems long ago he lost his woman to the Indians.
Been hunting to find her ever since.
Every time he hears of a white woman up for trade, he packs a mule and goes.
Don't matter where.
'Course, there's them that tries to tell him his wife's dead.
But he goes right on looking.
You'd think he'd give up, it being so long and all.
But he don't.
I guess he never will.
Sure must've been a love between them two.
Funny thing.
I guess Ben don't, but I do like Mr. Cody.
Mrs. Lowe, there's something you ought to know.
Ben and me...
Well, sometimes he figures we got to do things that...
Things that just ain't...
What I'm trying to tell you is, that no matter what happens between here and Lords, you stick close to Cody, and just as close as you can.
Yes, Dobie. Yes, I will.
- Ben.
- Hello.
Maybe we ought to think again about Cody and the woman.
Now, I know it's a lot of money, but...
You got any idea how long it would take us to make that amount of money, Dobie?
- Three years?
- More.
Well, losing Frank and all, that only puts us two against one.
Now, a man like Cody, that ain't good odds, Ben.
- That ain't good odds at all.
- I know.
We can't come straight at him.
We wouldn't have a chance.
- We're gonna have to figure us a plan and...
- I have.
You have? When do we do it?
Soon.
If they catch us in that open, it's gonna make the hill higher to climb.
What do you think, Cody?
Stand your animals.
When I reach the other side of the clearing, come on across.
What if you don't reach it?
- Circle high around.
- Cody.
Here.
Dobie, stay with the woman.
I thought I told you to circle high around.
I couldn't let them do you without a chance, Cody.
You would have had the woman.
I never could've enjoyed spending that
5,000 if I'd done you that way.
I'll go catch up your horse.
- Now, hold still.
- My leg's all right, Mrs. Lowe.
- You got any whiskey?
- No, ma'am.
But Ben's got some of that jackass liniment.
Claims it'll cure anything.
It was a foolish thing to do, riding out on that open alone.
- It's a wonder they didn't kill you.
- They tried.
Here it is.
But you ain't gonna make him drink it?
It's gonna hurt.
Followed that war party about a mile.
They won't be back.
- No?
- They picked up their dogs and squaws.
- Means they've headed back into the hills.
- They're done with killing. For now, anyway.
Then we should be in Lordsburg by tomorrow with no trouble at all.
Yes, ma'am. No trouble at all.
We're just taking a look around before we bed down for the night.
- So was I. Man can't be too careful.
- Yeah.
Which reminds me of a story.
Another fellow was bringing in a wife for bounty.
Some no-goods fell in with him, rode along.
Plain what they were planning.
- Just a matter of when.
- So?
- So he told them.
- Told them?
- They shouldn't try.
- But they didn't pay no heed.
Should have. He buried them.
That's a very sad story, Cody.
Didn't have to be.
This fellow, how did he manage it, doing all of them that way?
- Comanche got one.
- What happened to the other?
Let's just say he had a way with a gun.
Don't mind if I do. Don't mind at all.
Thank you, ma'am.
You cook good, Mrs. Lowe.
A woman should cook good.
I'm a pretty good cook myself.
Mrs. Lowe, I'm gonna miss you.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks.
We'll be in Lordsburg for sure tomorrow, won't we?
Yes, ma'am.
- Mr. Cody, I'm frightened.
- Frightened?
I have a feeling things will never be the same.
You'll forget.
You haven't.
- Dobie told me about your wife.
- Did he?
You must have loved her very much.
- Will you be staying on in Lordsburg?
- No, ma'am.
I was hoping you would.
Make things easier somehow.
Mrs. Lowe, what Dobie told you, it's been 10 years ago, that happened.
Knowing you is the first in all that time
I've ever been able to forget, even for a little while.
I'm obliged.
Get up.
Toss them on that blanket.
Now get on your animals and get out of here.
What?
I lay eyes on you two between here and Lords, I'll kill you.
- You got no call to do this, Cody.
- Don't I? Move.
- You know something, Ben?
- What's that?
I'm glad it's over.
Glad we didn't have to go through with it.
What would we have done with all that money, anyway?
Different if we had a purpose.
You know, owned something of our own.
Something we could put it to, like land or cattle or something like that.
But the way we are, I'm glad.
I bet you are, too, huh, Ben?
- Dobie.
- Yeah?
Remember me telling you I had a plan?
- Yeah.
- Well, I've still got it.
Well, this is it.
Laying out here with a long gun waiting for Mr. Cody to come riding into range.
But, Ben, we ain't got a long gun.
Ain't we?
The only way into Lordsburg, along there, over them rocks, or past here.
All we gotta do is wait.
Better get them animals back out of sight.
- Ben.
- Hello.
I want no part of it.
Where do you think you're going?
When I thought it was over, Ben,
I felt good. I felt good inside.
I haven't felt like that in a long while.
You wouldn't be thinking of doubling back to Cody and the woman, would you?
I've been obliged to know you, Ben.
Dobie! Dobie!
Wait here.
Lane, he's got a gun.
I'm gonna work high around.
See if I can come in behind.
You see him, start shooting and don't stop.
Lane!
Hello.
Drop the gun.
- Do that, I won't have a chance, Cody.
- As much as Dobie did.
- That was a fair fight.
- He was killed from behind.
- He was a fool.
- Depends on how you look at it.
Don't seem right we can't work this out with words, Cody.
Hadn't been for me, you'd be in the ground in that canyon back where the Comanche jumped you, remember?
- I remember.
- I figured you would.
Drop the gun.
If I spin and do you,
I'll get the woman, Cody.
- I wouldn't try.
- Got to.
- Come too far to turn back now.
- Don't do it, Ben.
It's a pure shame, ain't it?
How a man'll push himself for money.
Yes, sir. Pure.
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
Nancy?
Yes, John, I'm home.
Go help your father.
You never told me.
If you knew my man, you'd understand he'd have to have a reason not to come after me.
Yes, ma'am. I always figured there was.
Thank you, Mr. Cody.
Hello, sweetheart.
In the territory of New Mexico,
toward the end of the Civil War...
an Indian, Sierra Charriba,
and his 47 Apache warriors...
raided, sacked, and looted an area
almost three times the size of Texas.
On October 31, 1864...
an entire company
of the 5th United States Cavalry...
sent out from Fort Benlin to destroy him...
was ambushed and massacred
at the Rostes ranch.
We are indebted to Timothy Ryan, bugler,
5th United States Cavalry...
the company's sole survivor, for his diary...
the only existing record of this tragedy,
and the campaign that followed.
Let go of me! I want my mom!
Pony soldier, I am Sierra Charriba.
Who you send against me now?
- Lieutenant!
- Sir?
Take the first, second and third squads and cover the ridge sides.
- Yes, sir.
- If I signal you to come, you come.
If I signal you to charge, you charge.
If I signal you to run, you follow me and run.
- Otherwise hold your position.
- Yes, sir.
- First squad to the right.
- Mr. Potts.
Second squad to the left.
Major.
I'm a long way from Gettysburg.
Any suggestions?
Let's go have a look, slow and easy.
To the left. To the right.
November 1.
This morning I returned with the relief
column to the scene of the massacre.
The Major had expressed little hope...
that any of the civilians or troopers
would be alive.
But Samuel Potts, the Major's scout...
knew Apaches well
and said they never kill boy children.
They take them as captives
and raise them as warriors.
He felt the three Rostes boys
may still be alive.
But he had no such hope
for their sister, Beth.
He was right.
I looked down at her
and thought with hatred of Riago...
our Apache scout, who led us to this place.
His body was never found...
and I will always wonder if he escaped
the massacre or was part of it.
Hold your positions!
- That scarf belonged to Lt. Brannin.
- That's for you, Major.
I hope he was dead when they did that to him.
If he was dead they wouldn't have bothered.
- Go cut him down, Sergeant.
- Brannin was a soldier, Amos.
Goes with the pretty girls and the pension.
How much chance have I of getting those children back?
One chance in a thousand, I'd say... if they gave you a division and a year to do it, at least.
Much chance of that, is there?
I'll take five days to get men, horses, ordnance.
On the fifth day I want you back at Fort Benlin to tell me where Charriba is.
I'll get the children and I'll get him.
- Sam.
- Yeah?
Don't get yourself killed.
That would inconvenience me.
Ryan!
With so many troopers away...
five Confederate prisoners
broke out of Fort Benlin and escaped.
We trapped them on our way back.
Evening, Ben.
Evening, Amos.
Should have tried it before I took command.
Command of what, the burial detail?
- Move them out, Lieutenant.
- Move them out!
Troops, right! Pair of twos, right!
I brought back your wandering boys,
Captain.
Now you tell me how they got loose.
They clubbed two guards and went over the wall.
I'd like to point out, Amos, at the time of the escape...
131 men of this command were half a day's march from here... either digging graves or rotting in the sun, waiting to be buried.
I want every prisoner that can walk on this parade ground in 10 minutes.
Including those in irons.
Bugler, sound assembly.
They're gonna give us a party, Captain.
It sure looks like it.
You thieves, renegades, deserters... you gentlemen of the South.
I want some volunteers.
I want volunteers to fight the Apache Sierra Charriba.
I need horse soldiers.
Men who can ride, men who can shoot.
In return I promise you nothing.
Saddle sores, short rations, maybe a bullet in your belly.
And free air to breathe, a fair share of tobacco, quarter pay.
My good will.
Best offices for pardons and paroles when we get back.
I don't know what that might be worth to you.
But I do know if any man signs on with me and then attempts to desert...
I will shoot him out of hand.
From you I'll accept one man with some experience of command... as an acting lieutenant.
Captain Tyreen... does the prospect of serving under your country's flag once again... seem more attractive than dragging its chains in this prison?
It is not my country, Major Dundee.
I damn its flag and I damn you... and I would rather hang than serve.
Corporal Veitch just died, sir.
And hang you will!
You and your four good friends.
You're going to stand trial on a charge of murder.
That guard you clubbed just died.
You've been found guilty of the charges and specifications here mentioned.
It is the sentence of this court that on November 6... at 6:00 a.m. you shall be hanged by the neck until dead.
Remove the prisoners, with the exception of Benjamin Tyreen.
Right face, forward march.
These proceedings are closed.
Sit down.
Five years.
You're still blaming me instead of yourself, huh?
I'll say one thing, Ben, you sure haven't mellowed any.
When are you going to learn you made all your own troubles?
Who had me cashiered out of the regiment?
I cast one vote out of five.
Two of those votes were for my acquittal.
But not you. Not my own captain.
Not my own friend.
The conscience of the court was not my concern.
What did concern you, Amos?
- That the man I killed was a Yankee?
- He was your brother officer.
It was a duel of honour.
You're Southern born, you knew what that meant.
If he had killed me, and he had a chance...
- would you have convicted him?
- I would.
You're a liar.
You voted to please the generals in Washington.
You voted a promotion for Amos Charles Dundee.
You're a traitor to your country, Ben.
You gonna blame me for that, too?
Sergeant!
Yes, sir.
I should have known better than to try to talk to you.
You'll try again, Major.
The Major had asked for thieves,
renegades and deserters...
and that's what he got.
After four hours he had accepted only three.
Ryan, what are you doing here?
I'm volunteering, too, sir. I've earned it, sir.
You'll need a bugler, sir.
- Stand over there.
- Yes, sir.
Benjamin Priam, sir.
What do you do?
What did you say?
- Speak up, I can't hear you.
- I'm a horse thief!
You a good horse thief?
The best there is, sir.
Sign your name or make your mark.
I need horses and mules, Mr. Priam.
Here's the amount you'll have to spend... and here is your safe-conduct.
- Do you need an escort?
- No, sir.
He'll be back, sir.
Yes, sir. I will, sir.
- Corporal.
- Yes, sir.
- Get Lt. Andreen.
- On duty, Major.
- Lt. Fredericks.
- Hospital.
- Lewison.
- Officer of the day.
- Sgt. Cable?
- Patrol.
- Get me Lt. Graham.
- Yes, sir.
- Five hours, five men.
- You need a regiment.
Charriba can't be taken by a pick-up company of garrison troopers.
You should know that by now.
What are you trying to say, Frank?
Come on, speak up. Spit it out!
I'm not trying to say that the massacre was your fault.
I'm saying that you should recognise that your transfer to this post... was a disciplinary action, pure and simple.
And if you try to fight your own war again as you did at Gettysburg, they'll break you.
They won't break me, not if I get Charriba and those kids.
Has it occurred to you, Major... that the Apache will undoubtedly enter Mexico for the winter?
Mexico presently contains an army of 30,000 French soldiers.
Yes, it's occurred to me.
Frank, I am a professional soldier,
I'm not a prison keeper.
Now this is something that's gotta be done and I'm gonna do it... now!
Are you pursuing the Apache, Major, or a promotion?
Whatever my reasons are, Frank... you'd better get down on your knees and pray to God I don't take you with me.
I suppose you intend to strip this garrison.
I will take just 10 men from the command.
Volunteers.
The bulk of my force will be made up of prisoners.
You'd be well advised not to accept Confederate prisoners... even if they're forthcoming.
In my absence, you'll assume command of the garrison.
Discharge all duties incumbent upon that command.
I have, as you can see... appended to your orders a statement over my signature... to the effect that I assume total and complete responsibility... for all such actions.
Here. Does that cover it?
No, sir.
I consider it my responsibility to notify General Carlton... of what I believe to be an irresponsible and dangerous course of action.
- Do your worst.
- You could be shot for this, Amos.
My executioners will have to stand in line.
That's all, Captain.
Corporal Tinney!
Sir?
Where in hell is Lt. Graham?
Carry on.
- The Major's waiting to see you, sir.
- Thank you, Corporal.
- Sir!
- Lieutenant Graham.
- They're not much, are they?
- No, sir, they don't seem to be.
Cigar?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Coffee?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
Why did they put you in the cavalry,
Lieutenant?
- Sir?
- Why did they assign you to the cavalry?
You're ordnance, aren't you?
No, sir. Artillery.
- Artillery?
- Yes, sir.
As Napoleon said, "Only thunderbolts can be preferred to cannon."
- Napoleon?
- Yes, sir!
You'll do, Lieutenant. You'll have to.
I need rifles and ammunition.
It's all listed there in that inventory: number of rounds, types of ordnance.
You go get them for me.
Forthwith.
Yes, sir!
Lieutenant.
- Sir?
- Where are you going?
I said, "Where are you going?"
To obtain... these weapons?
And just how and where do you intend to accomplish that?
It has come to my attention that a supply train from the Ordnance Depot... at Denver, en route to the 2nd California Column... now garrisoned in Santa Fe... should be encamped tomorrow morning at the Sand River crossing... thirty miles away.
Now, if you have the opportunity, you might just take C Troop.
See if you can be of any assistance.
Yes, sir.
November 4.
Lt. Graham had no official orders,
but this didn't stop him.
He was very persuasive,
with Sgt. Gomez and C Troop standing by.
He took what the Major needed.
We returned with 48 new Henry rifles,
5,000 rounds of ammunition...
and a baby howitzer
for the lieutenant to play with.
I see you transferred back to the artillery,
Lieutenant.
Yes, sir.
Over a hundred civilian prisoners
volunteered...
and from them the Major took six,
and they were doubtful at best.
While we waited for horses,
the rebel prisoners that we needed...
watched the gallows being built.
The gallows on which the Major will hang
Sgt. Chillum, the Hadley brothers...
Jimmy Lee, and their captain.
Captain.
- You figure he's bluffing?
- Sure, he's bluffing.
He needs us much more than we need him.
Captain, that ain't no dance floor they're building for us.
We just want you to know, sir, that whatever you figure on... we're all with you.
Without Confederate volunteers,
the Major was forced to accept cowboys...
drifters and drunks.
You wanted Injun-fighting, mule-packing, whiskey-drinking volunteers, sir.
Well, by God, you've got one.
What am I going to do with you?
He's the biggest drunk, but the best packer in the territory, sir.
- What's your name?
- Wiley.
Wiley, make your mark.
- Whiskey?
- All you can drink.
When you've earned it.
Sergeant, throw him in a cell and dry him out.
- Come on, Wiley.
- I never seen anything like it.
- How many is that, Ryan?
- Twelve, sir.
- Name?
- Dahlstrom.
Any man with a just cause should travel with the word of God.
With all due respect,
God has nothing to do with it.
I intend to smite the wicked, not save the heathen.
Seventeen years ago,
I married John and Mary Rostes.
Who that destroyeth my flock,
I will so destroy.
Reverend.
November 5.
The Confederate prisoners are angry
and uneasy, waiting for tomorrow...
the day the rebel captain
and his four companions are to hang.
We are fearful of the consequences.
All of us know the Major needs the Captain
and his men...
but the Major is stubborn.
I think he will hang them
if they don't volunteer.
I would like to volunteer, sir.
Me and my six coloureds.
I haven't asked for volunteers from the command.
- We're doing the asking, sir.
- Why?
To fight, sir.
We've been standing guard and cleaning stables for nearly two years.
Tomorrow morning you ask the officer of the day to see me.
You and your six coloureds.
Thank you, sir.
The rebel captain
Ben Tyreen's compliments, sir.
He will see you now.
He will?
Yes, sir.
And he further states that he will volunteer himself and his men as needed... for double rations for all prisoners plus Gen. Carlton's written guarantee... that all Southern soldiers who serve with you, sir... will be automatically granted full pardon.
Now, sir, if I may be so bold as to suggest...
Guard!
- Open it up.
- Yes, sir.
Major, it has come to my attention...
You kill one of my soldiers and then have the gall to dictate terms to me?
You're a damn traitor, Ben.
You were a rebel before you ever saw the South.
And now you're a murderer.
Tomorrow morning, I am going to hang you and be done with you.
Jailer.
Sergeant!
How many men do you need?
Twenty. Good ones.
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed, only that.
Agreed.
Then you have my word, Major.
We will serve.
But after that we're going home.
If it's too rich for you... hang us now and be done with it.
I just might hang you and that Injun to the same tree, Ben.
You'll play hell getting it done, Amos.
This man will hold lieutenant's rank under myself and Lt. Graham.
Will you serve?
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed, sir.
Attention!
Lieutenant Graham, get away from that damn bell!
Priam, they're a bunch of Roman-nosed, broken-gutted, spavined... sore-footed, swaybacked dogs.
You call yourself a horse thief?
Samuel Potts!
Those Injuns you got with you look kind of shy, Samuel.
- They ain't sure they're welcome, Amos.
- Get on up here. I'll buy you a drink.
Ryan!
Today Mr. Potts got back.
With him was Riago.
If Lt. Brannin were alive
he would hang the Apache...
and I would help.
Yeah, but where in Mexico?
The children?
Well, they're skinny, but doing better than you'd expect.
Making their own arrows now.
That's Riago who rode in with you, isn't it?
They all look alike to you, Amos?
I asked you a question, Sam.
That's Riago.
Where'd you find him?
Didn't. He found me.
He said after the massacre he hit for the bush, stayed on their trail... figured I'd be along sooner or later.
I believe him, Amos.
Who's the other one?
He's got a personal score to settle.
Seems old Charriba wouldn't take him along with him on this last raid.
Said he couldn't be trusted.
Now he's got his mind set on killing the old man.
Do you expect me to believe these Apaches will turn against their own families?
Track down their own people?
Why not?
Everyone else seems to be doing it.
Lt. Brannin didn't trust Riago. Right, Ryan?
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid I go along with that, Sam.
Well, you go along with Lt. Brannin then.
Well, you go along without me.
Sam Potts.
Looks like the Union jackets you gave us didn't quite fit, Major.
So I see.
The last day was spent getting
acquainted with our comrades-in-arms.
Learning how to handle the pack animals
with sureness and dispatch.
And learning the character of our officers.
Troop, fall in!
Foot soldiers,
I want a company of twos on my right.
Cavalry, fall in 20 paces in front of me.
I want a column of twos on my right!
Line up here.
Get that mule out of there!
Fall them in with the artillery,
20 paces in front of me!
Column of twos on my right!
Fall in!
If I tell you one more time, you're court-martialed!
Why don't you find a horse and mount up,
Lieutenant Graham?
You don't seem to be doing very well on foot.
Mount up!
November 7, and we were ready,
all who volunteered.
Civilians, criminals, Southerners,
and Negroes.
Gentlemen, we've given the Major our parole... and we will serve him until I say we will not.
And until that time... he will be your commanding officer and will be treated as such.
And any sign of disrespect to him will be taken as a personal insult by me.
Don't worry none, Uncle Ben, when the time comes... we'll turpentine that caulky, chicken-picking Yankee.
I am not your uncle, you redneck peckerwood.
And one more word out of you and you'll end this campaign in chains.
Attention!
Good luck, Frank.
Give my regards to the General.
I mean for you to have that pleasure within the week, Amos.
If you don't, good luck.
I have but three orders of march:
If I signal you to come, you come.
If I signal you to charge, you charge.
And if I signal you to run, you follow me and run like hell.
Move them out, Lieutenant.
- Twos right!
- Twos right!
- Left turn!
- Left turn!
- Whistle me a tune, son.
- Yes, sir.
November 18.
We are now in Texas approaching Mexico.
And the Major
does not mean to be surprised...
by Confederate patrols out of Fort Davis.
- No fires tonight, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Trooper Hadley, you are not part of my gun crew.
Cold coffee again.
It's 50 miles to the border, and 86 to Fort Davis.
I wonder if we'll make it.
Make what, Sergeant Chillum?
Make it back to where we come from,
Captain.
We'll make it. It's just a question of time.
It was just after dawn and we were starting
for the Rio Grande when Riago returned.
I still don't trust him.
- Twos right!
- Major.
Says he got close enough to smell the stink of many white men.
I wager they're waiting for us at the river, Amos.
- We'd better walk on water.
- Let's find out what we're made of.
Boy!
Full gallop, son. We'll let those rebels know there's a Yankee army come to call.
Troop, halt!
Mr. Potts. Sergeant Gomez.
First 12 men across as skirmishers.
- Troop right, roll!
- Lieutenant Graham, move them out!
Column of twos.
Confederate cavalry, Lieutenant.
We don't have much time.
Your word's worth about as much as your cause.
- Then why don't you release him from it?
- Ben, you gave it, you break it.
And be damned to you.
- What do you want from us anyway?
- I've got what I want, Sergeant.
I've got his word.
- Sergeant Chillum.
- Sir.
- Move them out.
- Which way, Captain?
To Mexico, you bloody idiot!
November 19. We are in Mexico...
and this day's events
have made it clear to everyone...
that the Major's present war is not
with the South, but with the Apache.
- Lunge!
- That's very good, Aesop.
Thank you, sir.
But as Napoleon said, only thunderbolts can be preferred to cannon.
- Good night.
- Good night, sir.
Order arms.
Thank you, Priam.
Boy, I'm speaking to you!
You're forgetting your manners, nigger.
Come on over here and pull off my boots.
Lieutenant Graham.
Check the pickets.
Did you hear me, boy?
Do it, boy, now.
Let me, son.
Let go off my leg!
Preacher, you sure kick up a lot of dust with your sermon.
Don't forget your footgear, sonny.
- You started it, now finish it.
- No, we're gonna finish it.
By doggies, Preacher, now we're gonna get in line for you.
- I'm gonna cut me a piece of you first.
- You southern trash sit down!
Was you talking to me, Sergeant?
Now maybe you don't know it, but you're fixing to get tried.
You and all the rest of your bluebellies.
Trooper!
Mr. Aesop, we would like to compliment you and your men... on the way you handled the river crossing this afternoon.
Thank you, sir.
That gesture was necessary.
I'm sorry it was so painful for you.
Mr. Aesop is a fine soldier.
It won't happen again.
What happened is what it's all about, Ben.
If it was as simple as that, Amos.
We can take care of our own.
If you can, you waited too long to do it.
All you people, all the way down the line.
"You people"?
I'm not going to thank you for keeping your word this afternoon at the river.
You were obliged to.
But it wasn't easy, and I respect you for it.
I don't need respect from a man who took his kin to fight against their own brothers.
I took soldiers to fight for their country.
- You betrayed it.
- What country have I to betray?
I'm fighting for the only country I have left, and I kill men in a hopeless war for it.
But not men who were my neighbours and my friends.
Friends.
The best friend you ever had was the man who got you into West Point.
He was killed with the 2nd Michigan in Chickamauga last winter.
- Did you know that?
- I knew that, Amos.
You're a would-be cavalier, an Irish potato farmer with a plumed hat... fighting for a white-columned plantation house... you never had and never will.
How exactly do you see yourself,
Major Dundee?
Have you ever stopped to think why they made you a jailer instead of a soldier?
December 22, 1864.
We are five weeks into Mexico...
and have lost all contact with the Apache.
Even the scout, Samuel Potts, admits this,
and I'm glad.
I wish to avenge the massacre,
but I remember it too well, and I'm afraid.
How can we catch the wind
or destroy an enemy we never see?
It is Christmas Eve,
the year of our Lord, 1864...
and there is a deep and reverent sense of
peace and tranquillity in the camp tonight.
Mr. Potts and Riago, the Apache...
indulge in a high-spirited,
brotherly bout of wrestling.
At stake is Mr. Potts' gold railroad watch...
and the Apache's shotgun
with the silver inlaid stock.
It is a friendly contest.
Come on, Injun, get up.
There he is over there, go get him!
- That one brought him.
- Get up!
I think he's going to take you, Samuel.
You know why?
Because the artillery's betting on you.
Do you know Lt. Graham's bet $5 on you?
Artillery and a lieutenant, to boot.
Did you ever hear of an artilleryman winning a bet, or a girl... or a war when there was cavalry about?
- Who bet against me?
- Me.
- Just one, Major. He wants to talk.
- Bring him in.
He says he's a good Apache, and he's peaceful... and for nobody to shoot at him.
- Is he a Chiricahua?
- He surely is.
Why would an old man like that be raiding with Charriba?
He says, why not? It's their land, all of it.
Now he'd like a little soft food as his teeth are no longer with us.
Why did he quit?
Charriba kicked him out.
He says he's too old, much too old to fight anymore.
Ask him why I should believe him.
Well?
He says Charriba's camp is across the river.
He'll lead us there. They'll be asleep.
Does he expect me to believe that?
Let him lead us into an ambush?
He says his heart is true, Major... and he brings proof.
What kind of proof, Mr. Potts?
The children.
He's brought the children.
Pretty good.
Go on, sing up.
Soup's on.
Here's one for you, shorty.
Come on, buck, get around here where you can eat.
- Can I have seconds?
- Get in here.
- Don't we get any?
- Watch out, don't spill it.
Don't look to me like them gut-eaters has been feeding them very good.
- Did you ever see a fat Apache?
- I ain't yet.
This is good.
You're going back now that you've got what you came for, Major?
Everything points to that old man talking straight.
Potts is half convinced.
I'm more than half.
Did it ever occur to you that Charriba gave us what we wanted... because he intends to take it back again?
It's occurred to me.
I want two of your best men to help Sgt. Gomez take the children home.
We'll still outnumber you, Amos.
You surely will, Ben.
Now go do as you're told.
Yes, sir.
But only until the Apache is taken or destroyed.
Sgt. Gomez headed back to safety
with the three Rostes boys...
while we followed the old Apache
toward Sierra Charriba.
Lieutenant, take 12 men across as skirmishers.
First 12 men, follow me.
- Sergeant Chillum, take them through.
- Yes, sir.
Get them back to the far side of the river!
Back to the river!
- Try and regroup on the far bank!
- Hadley, run them out!
Keep moving, Lieutenant Graham, there's nobody left to shoot at out here.
Merry Christmas.
He was making a doll for his girl child.
Riago!
How did they know?
They're Apache.
Just what in hell is he?
I'm a tame Apache.
A camp dog.
Christian Indian.
Charriba is Apache.
Sam, you take this camp dog and go find me Charriba.
That's what you pay us for, Amos.
- Wiley, did you get hit?
- No, sir.
One of them damn mules kicked me.
Fourteen men killed, sir. Thirteen wounded.
Four critically.
70% of all stores lost, 20% ammunition... and 60% of livestock either killed or stolen.
- Damn it to bloody Confederate hell!
- What?
- Sorry.
- He's all right, Doctor.
He'll live forever and have a hundred children.
But if time and battle prove that you have a weakness... for being shot in that vicinity,
I'd wear an iron board inside my pants.
You tell him go easy with that, Major, or I'll shoot you right between the eyes.
You patrolled this whole area with Grant in '47, didn't you?
Yes. The tequila was excellent.
How far would you say we are from the nearest food and shelter?
About a week's march. Maybe less.
There's a pretty village, and rather friendly.
If you're really serious about replenishing our supplies... there's a well-stocked garrison
I could recommend just about here.
But we'd probably have to tangle with some French Lancers.
That's one thing I plan to avoid.
Major, we can't follow the Apache.
I'm not letting go of that Injun.
- Boy!
- Sir!
Pass the word to the command we move out in the morning.
And bring me a bottle of that medicinal brandy.
There is no more brandy, sir, except at the bottom of the river.
Now this time, Lieutenant, try and hold still.
Prepare to move out in the morning.
We left a lot at the bottom of the river.
We ask thee, Lord, to take these soldiers who have fallen in thy service.
Amen.
We got whipped, Major.
Burying your dead is not going to change it.
January 9, 1865.
Sgt. Gomez and the troopers returned today.
The Rostes boys are well and safe.
This made us feel better, but not for long.
He's not running anymore.
He's waiting.
Let's move. Mount up!
January 10.
Two more died last night.
I'm afraid all the wounded will perish
unless we rest.
I wonder whether any of us will ever return.
The war of rebellion and Fort Benlin
seem very far away.
The village is occupied.
The blockhouse, there are 10, 15 men.
Regulars, I think. I don't know.
Their garrison is about six hours away... and about 300 Lancers,
Legionnaires, or maybe less.
We'll move on the village at sunup.
Dismount! Prepare to fight on foot!
- Horses to the rear.
- Get those horses!
- Point blank range.
- Fuse timing zero.
Unload.
Locked, loaded and primed, and ready for firing.
- Stand by.
- Standing by, sir.
Boy, whistle me a tune.
Will you show the colours, sir?
No, Lieutenant, we will not show the colours.
All right, Sam, make it short and to the point.
Hey, get out here!
Compliments, Major Amos Dundee, irregular United States Cavalry.
You have five minutes to surrender your arms and stores...
- or he's going to cut loose.
- He would not dare.
This is an act of aggression against a friendly power...
- an outrageous breach of international law.
- Sonny... the Major ain't no lawyer.
You've now got four minutes.
Sergeant, I want to talk to the mayor.
- There seems to be no end to it.
- What did you say?
We've been attacked by Apaches, by local bandits... by freebooters from Texas, then liberated by the French... and now United States Cavalry.
Unfortunately, you came too late.
We have nothing to give you.
No food, no guns, no women.
That is what you want, isn't it?
That's why you come here without flying your country's brave flag.
Are you speaking for these people?
You're not Mexican, are you?
My husband was the doctor of this village.
But he was also the doctor for the Juaristas.
He died there, where they did.
I've paid for my place here.
Well, I'm sorry for that, ma'am, but we've come a long way.
I need fresh horses and food.
My men are hungry.
They are no more hungry than this village.
They are willing to share everything they have got with you, Major... most particularly their hunger.
Would you like to see the children in our dispensary... whose sickness is starvation?
- Lieutenant Graham, fire!
- Sir!
Sgt. Gomez, slaughter two mules, distribute the meat... and whatever stores you find in that blockhouse to the people of the village...
- and to this lady.
- Teresa. Teresa Maria Santiago.
- Ma'am. Ryan!
- Yes, sir.
Lieutenant!
With beauty such as yours, this village is rich beyond comparison.
Lieutenant Tyreen!
God save the Queen.
We entered the village
to take food and horses...
but instead gave away our own,
and everyone was thankful.
Our wounds were tended
by a German lady...
who spoke English and was pretty,
if somewhat old.
- Hold it there, will you?
- Thank you, ma'am.
Also, a very lovely Mexican girl
who was kindness itself, gentle and young.
Don't worry, son, it ain't near your heart.
To the victors belong the spoils.
Well, Ben, you look quite the gentleman.
After the war, Amos... the Tyreens of County Clair become the landed gentry of Virginia.
It's not over yet.
By midnight tonight I want every man in this command drunker than a fiddler's bitch.
At that point, our prisoners will escape and run for help.
But we will not discover this until sunup.
Tomorrow night, after following us all day... that French cavalry will camp and prepare to attack our disorganised rabble.
But before they make their move, we will steal them blind and be on our way.
You are either... a $70, red-wool, pure-quill military genius... or the biggest damn fool in Northern Mexico.
No question of it.
You haven't got the temperament to be a liberator, Amos.
I don't?
If I may suggest, sirs, the time has come to join the fiesta.
Sitting alone is bad for the soul.
Captain Tyreen. Does he shave?
- Does it matter?
- Didn't to me.
She's not here.
Too bad.
There was something about that woman.
There sure, sure was.
Made me think of... satin.
- Soft, white satin.
- Major.
Excuse me, Major.
A waltz.
I'd be delighted, sir.
- Lieutenant Graham.
- Sir!
- Why aren't you with the pickets?
- I've been relieved, sir.
Carry on.
Sir, in my opinion we need more guards at the blockhouse... or the French prisoners are going to escape.
Thank you, Lieutenant, for your opinion.
Now, I trust you will carry on.
No, sir. You see, I'm cutting in, sir.
- What?
- Cutting in, sir.
Lieutenant Graham, have you been drinking?
- Señorita.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
A Mexican dance, perhaps?
I wanted to say goodbye, and thank you.
It was good to celebrate just being alive.
- Are you planning to stay on here now?
- I don't know.
I met my husband when he was a medical student in Vienna.
My family disapproved violently.
So violently, I no longer have any ties there.
And I'm needed here.
There is no one else except for Linda, not for a hundred miles.
You will say goodbye to Lt. Tyreen for me?
I'd be delighted.
I liked the way he asked me to dance.
As if we were in a ballroom in Vienna.
- It was a lovely little charade.
- The Lieutenant has style.
He must be a fanciful man.
He is corrupt. But I will save him.
Thank you for being kind.
All I feel is kindness.
Next time I'll be more fanciful.
Hadley! Wiley! Get them mules in here.
Mount up. Just fall in. Get in there.
Ryan is missing, sir.
Graham went to look for him.
- Who went to look for Graham?
- Gomez.
Sergeant Gomez, be gentle with the bugler boy.
He's ill.
Take your time, Trooper Ryan, take your time.
We're delighted you decided to join us.
Now if you'd only warned us, we could have sent Sgt. Gomez... to serve you breakfast in bed.
Ryan, put it in the saddle!
All accounted and...
All present and accounted for, sir.
I can see that, Lieutenant Graham.
I can clearly see that.
Suppose you could manage to move them out now?
Twos left, right turn.
Last night the Major let
the French prisoners escape.
He hoped they would go to
their garrison for reinforcements.
They did.
This afternoon he sent Lt. Graham
and some troopers out as a decoy.
The rest of us hung back, waiting.
Jefferson, that scarf is to decorate the cannon, not you.
- Yes, sir.
- Wiley, secure those pack animals.
Sergeant Chillum, are the pickets out?
They're out. Not that they'll do any good.
If them Lancers has got a fieldpiece... they could move it in, lay in one round, and then finish us off... with them 10-foot frog stickers they're packing.
No, they'll camp.
Begging your pardon, Lieutenant, but who says so?
I do.
Don't they look pretty?
My boys can take that outfit, the walking ones anyway... with one hand tied behind our backs.
How's that, Aesop?
They're soft, O.W.
They ain't never been south.
They're closing up.
They'll be less than five miles from Graham by full dark.
What if they don't stop?
What if they don't camp? They just keep on, smash hell out of the Lieutenant?
Mighty is the arm of the Lord.
January 15. It took the French
three days to discover...
all they were chasing was
a one-armed scout and a renegade Apache.
By that time, Mr. Potts and Riago
figured we were safe...
and decided to lose them and find us.
We rested and healed our wounds.
Hey! I'm drowning!
- Come on in.
- I already had my bath.
Hey, the water's fine.
- First shave, Tim?
- Yep.
- Maybe we should call you Ryan now.
- Yeah.
We are waiting for Mr. Potts, Sgt. Gomez...
and the rebel captain to return
from the scout.
We fear that the French have taken
reprisals against the village.
I keep thinking about Linda
and pray for her safety.
- What happened?
- Just like watching a bird die.
- And the woman?
- I don't know, Amos.
If they hanged her, they cut her down.
Them boys in the pretty hats make the Apache look like missionaries.
Never underestimate the value of a European education.
- No sign of Charriba?
- Don't worry about that, Amos.
He wants to drag it out.
I think he figures on leaving stories about you that'll be told... around the campfires of his people for a thousand years.
We were healing,
becoming a command again.
Hard and watchful, anxious for battle...
when that which
the Major hated most occurred.
Sir! A deserter.
O.W. Hadley has deserted, sir. Last night.
A horse is gone, food and ammunition supplies broken into.
Mr. Potts, you take Riago and pick up his trail.
I want that man back.
It ain't my job, Major.
I didn't sign on to go chasing after no homesick soldier boys.
It's mine.
All right, Sergeant, you find him.
Beg your pardon, sir... but what'll they do to Pvt. Hadley when they catch him?
What?
Son, it'd be our good luck if he killed him.
But he won't and the Major will.
Oh, no, Mr. Potts... the Major will not.
In two days,
Sgt. Gomez returned with O. W. Hadley.
Along the way he found the lady doctor
with some children and Linda.
They had all fled the village.
The Major wasted no time
trying O. W. Hadley for desertion.
Boys, by doggies, I want you to know what kind of company we've been keeping.
He just plain clean shot a hole in me.
And he would have let me bleed to death... if it hadn't been for that woman over there come along and bandaged up my leg.
Now, you know I ain't no deserter.
I just went into that village to court a little señorita and say hello to her folks.
I was fixing to come back. I was.
You all know I always stay close to my big brother.
- Ain't that right, Arthur?
- That's right.
And you ain't gonna let them shoot your kin for no deserter, are you, Arthur?
You gonna do something about it, ain't you?
Sergeant, I don't want to look up at him.
Captain.
You know me.
I've been over the hill before.
But I always come back, didn't I?
And you whipped me for it and I deserved it.
But you never killed me none.
Now you ain't gonna hand me over to no bluebelly... just because I had a hankering for a woman?
She's a sweet little thing, Captain.
She's pretty and polite and a lady.
She surely is.
And that grub is for her kinfolks.
You remember her, Captain?
I was dancing with her and I introduced you to her. You remember her, don't you?
I remember.
Sergeant Chillum, would you say it was common knowledge in this camp that... that village had been burned, people scattered?
Well, I know that, Major, sir... but I just figured I'd sit there and wait till they come back.
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, sir.
How much food and ammunition would you say was taken?
Enough for three men for a week, sir.
Look, Major, forget about the book.
The men of this command risked their lives for those supplies.
It may have slipped your mind, but he also risked his life.
Trooper... you're gonna be shot.
Hadley!
Major, hand him over to us.
I'll deal with him.
I'm not going to let you kill him.
You used to be a soldier.
Do you know what you're saying?
I'm saying if you kill that boy that's the beginning of it and not the end.
You're wearing out, Ben.
You were a rock once, now you're crumbling like old chalk.
Lieutenant, select a firing squad by lot.
- Exclude the Confederates.
- Yes, sir.
I said we will serve in this command and we will serve!
But only until we have caught the Apache.
And then, Major...
I am going to kill you.
Are you, Ben?
Yes.
Yes, Amos.
You gonna let them shoot me, Captain?
I'm obliged to, son.
You should have remembered you belong to the Major and not to me.
I'm sorry.
That's it, boys, by doggies... let's pitch in and get it over with.
Hell, Major, you're just doing what you got to do... but damn your soul for it, and God bless Robert E. Lee.
We are a command divided against itself,
and I fear nothing will ever heal this breach.
Even some of our own people
are bitter against the Major.
But he bears the burden of command
and I do not feel fit to judge him.
I'm not one of your soldiers.
I could not bear to be with all those men, in the midst of all that hatred.
- May I walk with you?
- Not afraid of the tiger?
Are you the tiger that prowls these mountains?
No, I'm not afraid, Major.
- Oh, it's lovely here.
- I don't spoil it?
No.
What happened today was terrible.
We all died a little with that boy.
But perhaps you, most of all.
Why are you with me?
I've seen too much dying... and I wanted so desperately to feel alive... for both of us to feel alive.
It troubles you a great deal, doesn't it, how the men feel about you?
I'm concerned with how they fight, not how they feel about me.
But why is this so important, this fighting?
There are other things.
Men can understand fighting.
I guess maybe they need it sometimes.
The truth is, it's easy.
Forget about your problems, responsibilities... just let someone feed you, tell you what to do.
But whom do you answer to?
If you go to Durango you'll have to go into hiding, won't you?
It will be difficult, but not impossible.
Did you ever think about living in the United States?
I don't think about that, Major.
Get it out.
I can't. It's too deep.
It's too close to the artery.
They have to take you to the doctor in Durango.
I'm staying with the command.
You get me some whiskey and bandages.
Go on.
Sergeant, get a stretcher for the Major.
You're getting leave, Major.
And it's time you did.
In fact, you ought to give up soldiering altogether.
You were trapped at the river.
Ambushed like a shavetail.
You caused a boy's death and you've split your own command.
And now how do you explain being outside your own picket lines?
What are you doing, Major, easing your conscience in the arms of a woman?
A woman, if I might say so, of rather doubtful virtue.
Just what the bloody hell are you doing here in the first place, Amos?
There are so many French soldiers in Durango.
We won't show the colours.
- I can't speak the language.
- But you understand.
Major.
It is close, very close.
If you're thinking of cutting that leg off, Doctor, don't.
I am only concerned to stop the loss of blood.
Though much of it is alcohol.
You should be able to walk in seven days and ride in twelve.
I'll walk in two and ride in one more.
Mr. Potts, you and Sgt. Gomez can rejoin the command now.
I can get to the river camp by myself.
And I'm perfectly capable of following your trail from there.
Well, you'd better stay off those streets, Amos.
You make an unlikely-looking Mexican.
No, it's no use.
They're on to me, those Frenchman.
Just waiting for me to run, lead them back to the command.
I see our French friends are still waiting.
The tequila. Did you bring the tequila?
I asked for something to drink.
This isn't enough to spit.
No.
Sure, it gets better every day.
Be able to dance on it soon.
You don't believe me?
I'll show you. Come on.
Miss Covington, I believe I have the honour of this next quadrille.
You wait and see.
This army doesn't dance... doesn't march, doesn't fight.
Except on this last battlefield.
We're joining the Juaristas at Guaymas.
I came here to reassure myself that you were still alive.
I'm alive.
Yes, I see.
You should be careful.
The French police is already suspicious of this place.
Wait.
If I ever do get out of here...
The war won't last forever.
It will for you, Major.
No, the war will not last forever.
"Awake! For Morning in the Bowl of Night
"Has cast the Stone that puts the Stars to Flight"
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to rescue you.
We spent all night looking for you.
- Why?
- So I can kill you myself.
Makes sense.
Well, there goes our little watchdog.
Shall we go, Major?
I drink, Ben. Did you know that?
That is the secret of my great success.
I drink.
But I don't drink enough.
Why don't you drink, Lieutenant Tyreen?
Don't you ever have any doubts about who you are?
I've been three men already, Amos.
That's enough for one lifetime.
- Irish immigrant...
- Cashiered American officer.
And Confederate renegade.
- I don't like any of them.
- Well, now, isn't that a coincidence.
Get away from me.
I have orders, appropriate to your character.
I have to take you out the back door.
- Finish it.
- The patrol. We leave now.
Leave me alone, all of you.
Company!
Sergeant Gomez.
Major.
Fire!
Lt. Graham will be a general before he's 30.
Why, come on, get out of it!
- Come on!
- Ben, for God's sakes, let me be.
Why not, Major?
You're not worth killing anyway.
Until the Apache is taken or destroyed.
January 30. We thought we had lost
three troopers in Durango...
but two returned this morning,
and we became a command again.
- Lieutenant Graham!
- Yes, sir.
When I left I gave you a specific order.
You failed to carry it out.
No, sir. You gave me a command.
From then on I gave the orders.
You surely did. Have a cigar.
Move them out, Lieutenant.
We ran from the French
as we followed the Apache...
but time was running out.
The French patrols became thicker
while we never got closer to Sierra Charriba.
- How long ago?
- Four or five hours ago.
Charriba says you're to make your peace with your Christian God... as you are about to join him.
We must have hurt the old man at the river more than we figured.
At least now he's got to finish it.
So far, he's been circling west.
Some time in the next week or two he'll hit us again in a canyon... or the middle of a river at night, or dawn.
When are we going to stop fighting this Indian on his own terms?
Right now.
From this point on we tuck our tail between our legs and run for home...
- straight for the Rio Grande.
- You'd let Charriba escape?
Let's just say I'm giving him an equal opportunity, Lieutenant.
Major, but we have to make it look good.
First swing right, then head for the river.
But we really got to move.
If we don't, he'll be waiting for us there, just like he is now.
- How'll we know?
- We won't, until it happens.
On your horse, Lieutenant, move them out.
- Go cut him down, Sam.
- You cut him down, Major.
I think he's earned it.
March 23. Today we learned
that Riago had been a true soldier.
I bitterly regret my suspicions,
as I'm sure does the Major.
April 18. We ran from the Apaches
and the French...
then circled and headed
for the river and home.
The men were angry,
wanting to continue our pursuit.
And then suddenly we all knew
we weren't running away from anything.
We were running toward
the end of our search.
River's less than a mile from here.
This is your last chance, Major.
It's as good a place as any to do what you got in mind.
Sergeant, if you put your pickets out far enough... the Apache might leave them alone.
But no matter what happens, don't fire unless you're attacked.
Just remember your orders and hope.
Good luck, Mr. Potts.
Who will you send against me now?
Fire.
He looks so small now.
He was big enough, son.
Now, Major... or across the river in Texas?
Right now is just fine, Ben.
You boys want a fight, I got one for you.
Get up here and look.
We had forgotten the French,
but the French had not forgotten us.
Where can we ford the river into Texas?
It's the only shallow spot within a half day's march from here, Major.
Mount up the troop, Lieutenant, we're going back home.
- Sergeant Gomez!
- Sir?
- Mount the troops, we're moving out now!
- Yes, sir.
Congratulations, Major.
It appears that at last you have found yourself a real war.
- Sergeant Gomez.
- Sir?
Dismount and deploy your men... prepare to receive a mounted cavalry charge from your front.
They won't charge, Major. Why should they?
By holding their positions, they hold us here for the others.
- We have to move against them.
- When I'm ready.
- Lieutenant Graham.
- Sir?
- Make ready your artillery.
- Yes, sir.
- It's ready, sir.
- Simon.
Break out the ammunition... we're about ready to engage the pride of Europe.
Yes, sir.
- Well, Ben?
- I'll need five men mounted.
I'll hit their flank after you break their charge.
- Bully.
- Bully.
Lieutenant, show the colours.
- Standard-bearer!
- Sir?
Show the colours.
- Sergeant Chillum.
- Sir!
Cut the fuse for 500 yards. Elevation 20...
- Make that 28 degrees.
- Ready, sir!
Start the ball, Lieutenant.
A mile, maybe less.
They'll be coming now.
- Sergeant Gomez.
- Sir?
- The bugle will be your signal to fire.
- Yes, sir.
Company, charge!
Any of you damn gringos fire before the signal...
I swear to God I kill you.
On my signal, the horses.
I repeat, only the horses.
Mount your men.
Take up a skirmish line at the foot of the bluff.
Here comes the second wave, Ben.
We're ready when you are.
Rally around me!
Major, I shall see you in Texas.
You're damn right you will. Bugler!
Dundee!
All present and accounted for, sir.
Your orders, sir.
Move them out, Lieutenant, column of twos.
Column of twos.
- Trooper Ryan!
- Sir.
- Play us a tune, son.
- Yes, sir.
Forward, ho!
April 19, 1865.
After a brief but costly battle
with French irregulars...
we crossed the Rio Grande
and re-entered the United States.
Whoa.
Coigne?
Whoa.
Hey, Leland!
Who's gonna unpack this mule?
I'm tired as hell!
Damn.
"Leland Drum.
A good friend shot dead... by I don't know what... and buried in this spot by Coley
Boyard, his good friend... in April."
Coley!
Who is that down there?
Willett!
That you, Coley?
Willett who?
Gashade! Gashade!
What's the matter with you?
You step out so's I can see you, if it's you.
You look! That over there's the pack mule, and that's Frazer, ain't it?
Well, so who could I be?
- Willett?
- He's crazy.
That's right! It's me!
Hi, Will!
Been sittin' up in the mine for two days.
Spooked near crazy.
Would've shot anything on two legs moving, Will.
'Ceptin' you. If I knowed it was you, I sure wouldn't have...
Never mind. Just tell me what you're telling me.
You should've been here, Willett!
Lettin' me go on thinkin' everyone's dead and me next.
I pulled up fever-sick,
I said, Coley.
Now, become calm and tell me in a way I can understand.
Where is Coigne?
Well, like I said, after you was gone Leland and Coigne decided to run into Winslow.
For the pleasure, Coigne says.
"Can I go?" He says no.
"Someone's gotta watch over stores and things, so you stay, Coley."
Well, then they go off.
Not comin' back till next morning, early.
I get waked by them pounding in like hell-bent.
Then I hear 'em talking mad and arguing, so as I conclude they're drunk.
I mean to go back to sleep when your brother Coigne tears inside here... and grabs up his roll mad as I ever seen.
I said, "What are you doing, Coigne?"
"Shut up," he says.
"I am taking your horse."
And he tears back out.
Sure enough, I see him throw onto my Shorty and dig out fast.
And there stands Leland, spittin' in the dust, disgusted.
"How come Coigne rode off that-a-way, Leland?"
"He rode a man and a little person down in the streets of Winslow.
Maybe it was a child," Leland says.
"But did he kill 'em?" I ask.
"He's not for sure, but he ain't waitin' to find out, and now he's runnin'."
"Oh, I hate to hear it," I says.
Then I crawls back in to sleep, assuming Leland done the same.
But damned if I don't get waked again.
Leland's voice I hear, and I don't know whose.
Thinking it's your brother, I open up the flap and look out at Leland drinking coffee.
I can't see nothing else, so I ask,
"Who you talking to, Leland?"
He looks like he's makin' to answer or to take a mouth of coffee... when just like that... his face all spitters out... spilling in his coffee and all over hisself... with none of his face left on with it.
I reckon someone come to settle with Coigne on account of what happened in Winslow... and got Leland instead.
Figurin' I'm next, I jumped back inside, scared white.
Give me the whips and jingles so bad, Will, I...
I can't yet catch hold of myself.
Is that the whole way of it, Coley?
I believe.
My mind's all unsatisfied with it.
Seem to me like if Leland had been involved with the event in Winslow... he'd have rode off too, wouldn't he, like the way you told me Coigne done.
Run a man and a little person down.
That's all Leland said. Maybe it was a child.
He's just a-sittin' there, gettin' killed that-a-way?
I got no understanding of it at all.
It's a terrible thing.
- Give me hold of your gun, Coley.
- What you want it for?
I might be gonna need it, so just give it to me.
No. I might be just a-needin' it too.
How do I know? All these happenings.
I hate to tell ya, all riled up like you are... but I been trailed most of the way here by I don't know who.
Where's your own gun?
Go on and use your own gun.
Well, it plainly ain't there, or I wouldn't be asking you.
No, sir. No. Not with trouble on the way.
I'm tired, Coley.
And I can't get me no sleep without you give it to me.
What about me?
It's all right.
You'll be dependin' on me.
Whereas it wouldn't have worked out the other way around.
Well, here I sit.
Just keep an ear, Coley.
Sure. Them with the gun can sleep.
Ain't as though I ain't been hawkin' night sounds till I can't tell a twit from a twig.
Shoot, I'm as tired as you.
Every bit.
Willett?
Hey, Will?
I'm depending on you.
Okay?
Lord A'mighty.
I'm so hungry I could chaw off my own arm.
I wouldn't sit there, Will.
That's right where he was at.
And right like you're sittin', drinkin' coffee.
Go on and stow them stores in the tent, Coley.
Maybe... Maybe could have been your imagination.
Huh, Will? Y-You think?
Do like I say.
Aw, shoot.
How come I always gotta be the one to...
Sure gonna be a bunch of ugly work, I'll tell ya... with just the one hand.
One more thing ain't to my likin'.
Aw, Bill, you can have my saddle
George, you can take my bed
Jack can have my pistol, boys
After I am dead
- Something's comin'.
- Boys...
Hey, remember, Willett, how Leland used to sing that song?
'Member?
Oh, boys, think upon me kindly
As you gaze upon my grave
Yes, sir.
Hey!
You crazy?
You crazy? Don't stand there! Git!
Lord A'mighty, what's comin'?
Go on then, Willett! Cover yourself!
I ain't got no gun! Remember?
How am I gonna be dependin' on you, starin' out into the sky like that?
Shut up!
I see somethin'!
- Something's comin'!
- From where?
Straight ahead. A bit to the right.
Get up here, Willett, while there's still time!
- Just one?
- I can't see.
Yeah. Yeah, one.
All right, Coley, get quiet now.
Duck back down.
Don't say nothin' at all.
I'm gonna... get down.
Will!
It's a woman.
Will ya look.
Will ya just look at that.
I'd be grateful if you'd sell me one of your horses.
You didn't arrive all to here afoot.
My horse stumbled and broke a leg. I shot him.
I'll pay you well for a good horse and for some shelter.
And if you would help me, please,
I need to get my things off my horse.
Well, I'd sure be glad to, ma'am.
Wouldn't we, Will?
No trouble at all.
I'd like the brown one.
The bay?
Oh, well, that bay there is Will's.
His, I mean, ma'am.
I like that one.
Well, main thing is,
I believe Will, he does too.
I like the brown one!
I'm gon' give you that black over there, miss.
He belonged to a dead man, so's you don't have to pay for him.
Coley, fetch Leland's pony out with just a bridle on her.
What about Coigne's, Will?
Well, he looks stove up.
Then I don't wanna be stuck with him.
Are you looking at me, Mr. Gashade?
How do you come by that name?
I hear you're a bounty hunter, Mr. Gashade.
- I wouldn't name myself as that.
- No?
It was just a way of making wages once.
- And now?
- Mining suits me just.
Well, you look less than prosperous at it.
How much would you ask to take me across the Supuecio to Kingsley?
I ain't askin'.
I told you I'd pay you very well.
And I said I'm doing just fine.
Look at me, Mr. Gashade.
Without perishing from the tricks of my own mind... how could I possibly get to Kingsley on my own?
Well, I ain't the only one knows the way, ma'am.
But it's you I'm asking.
Please think about it.
That's just what I'm doing.
Really nice pony you had here, miss.
Looks to me like you run him to death though.
Good pony like this hard to come by.
What'd you shoot him for?
There ain't a broke or unsound bone in his body.
I'll give you 500 now and
500 when we get there.
How long would it take?
Two weeks? Three?
How much gold could you dig out of this mine in three weeks, Mr. Gashade?
Three weeks?
Let me figure.
Oh, I'd say, bein' it's a... pretty dead hole, why...
Well, it wouldn't be a hell of a much.
Would you say, Will?
Yeah, I done the best
I could for ol' Lee.
By the time I got out my gun to help, why, he was already dead.
And what with Will's brother run off... well, there was only me to do the best I know how... for ol' Leland Drum.
It isn't April.
- What's that?
- It's March.
Oh.
"His good friend in... March?"
She don't like me much.
I don't know.
Sure holds out good wages though.
Yep.
But for what she don't say.
Take her to Kingsley, she say.
We'll see.
We're goin'?
I don't know.
What, Will?
Well, if Coigne got in bad...
He went and harmed someone or killed someone...
A man and a little person.
I'm wondering why nobody's come out here a-lookin' after him.
Maybe it was a child.
- Well, ma'am, I gotta...
- This water is not clean.
In fact, it's stagnant!
- Please!
- H-Hold on.
Do frogs breed in this water?
Not frogs.
- Well, what then?
- Oh, other things.
Here!
Oh, I'm sorry!
What is that?
Well, it's all I could find.
There's some type of snakes knowed to take a romp in that water.
- In this water?
- Oh, yeah.
And people been knowed to swallow one of their little eggs... and it'll hatch out inside 'em without they's knowing it till it's too late.
What do you mean, too late?
Well, suppose it was a poison snake and it hatch out hungry, as they do.
Well, what's it gonna eat but the nearest thing to it? And that's you.
Not me, because I didn't swallow any of it.
Well, you're lucky then.
Say, ma'am. Ma'am?
I been considerin', and,
I got an offer to make.
- Say, ma'am?
- Yes?
I'll take you up to
Kingsley like you asked, but Coley here's gonna have to go along with me.
And that's why I'm askin' a thousand dollars... so's I can pay him too.
Then there's that five you mentioned when I get you there.
That's it.
That's my offer.
All right.
Not fine, but all right.
Let's get started.
- Take it, Coley.
- No!
You take it, Mr. Gashade.
I'm ready to go.
We'll go tomorrow.
Now.
Morning always makes a good start.
Would you like to go with me now?
Me?
- Why, sure.
- Coley.
Take up the money then.
- Coley...
- Go on!
- Coley!
- What, Will?
Pack the mule.
No mule.
I do not intend to be held back by any mule.
Ain't nothin' will hold you back like no vittles, ma'am.
No mule!
Gashade! Do you know Cross Tree?
- I do.
- Well, head for there, please.
Cross Tree ain't Kingsley.
Never mind. First, Cross Tree!
- It's out of the way.
- By how much?
Twenty, 25 miles.
Which way?
Well, we'll have to go faster then.
Yes, sir.
You run on four now, you walk on two later.
Haul freight, Coley!
Come on!
Look at that splay-legged, plantered, spavined... wind-broke, damned droop-naped, galled stumbler...
Coigne went and stuck me with.
And takin' Shorty, who was as sound as a nickel.
Hell!
You can't haul no pale-pink, ratty, walleyed devil mule behind no horse... that ain't got the sense to switch flies!
No kiddin'.
This ain't no fun.
Howdy, miss.
We're stoppin', I guess.
She stalled again?
Unpack the grub out of those mules and let's eat.
You could try and be a little more pleasant.
Is that mule tethered, Coley?
You sure have a pretty way.
I surely don't ask that you be fond of me.
Tend the mule.
"Fond of me."
Surely fond of me.
Hold the talk.
Not even snake water could be more poisonous than this coffee.
Ma'am?
Do you think that maybe I could call you by your name or somethin'?
I mean, of course,
"Miss" this or that. You know.
And respectful, till you knew me better.
All right. You just tell me, what is your most favorite name?
Well...
My most favorite name?
Let's see.
My most favorite name... is...
Glory, sure is hard to think of a lady-type name.
Let's see. Well...
Yeah. There's my mama's name.
I know that one.
But now, I never did call her that though.
Well, just "Mama."
That's all right, Coley.
You just tell me. What was it?
Well, let's see.
My daddy called her by...
Hortensia.
Well, don't ever call me that.
Well, ma'am... just could you tell me what though?
Hush! She's been japin' you.
Can't you sense?
Now quit her,
'fore you get tromped on.
Aw!
Didn't you hear what she say, Will?
She called me by Coley.
She say...
"That's all right, Coley."
"Boyard, his good friend and-"
I don't know.
Something's been scratched off.
Looks to me like somebody settled with one of 'em.
- Yeah, look like.
- You gonna want to find out?
- Well, it don't matter.
- What about the other one?
Could be anywheres.
Well, might be they're just tryin' to throw us off with this here grave.
Well, then I'm throwed.
You mean we ain't followin' 'em?
Hell, I got my duties.
- It's so satisfying!
- Ma'am, you ain't sleepy?
Come on. Let's get started.
Where's the mule?
I told you to tether the mule!
I did, Will. Ain't he there?
I did, Will! I hobbled 'im.
Right over here. I swear.
You see? This here's what I attached on 'im.
Well, somebody just went and unattached him.
Will you please help me?
I wouldn't do that if I was you, ma'am.
Frazer's layin' back his ears.
He's just likely to let fly.
Exquisite.
Cursed, hellish sun!
- Well, blow on your wrists.
- Oh, shut up!
You mind telling me why we're goin' to Cross Tree?
We're goin' to Cross Tree?
What for, Willett?
For fresh horses?
That's right. Fresh horses.
So long, ol' Funeral.
March!
Coley?
Get two horses and as much store as you can pack on behind the three of 'em.
- No mule?
- No mule.
Only two ponies, Will?
How 'bout ol' Frazer?
- He's sound. Only two.
- Wait, Will.
Say, could I have me a little of that money for myself?
- What for?
- Aw, shoot. Nothin'.
Just so I could, you know, get me some do-funnies. Hell, somethin'.
You just get them horses packed and... get yourself a gun.
You just come from over there... and seen this friend of mine.
Did you? A woman?
Well, that's all right.
I'm traveling right along with her.
What's her name?
Huh?
Hold on here.
Listen, you tell me who she is and what she's doing over there, or I'll break you in half.
Have the paper?
What do you mean, a paper?
Writing? A letter?
Do you read?
Who give it to you?
Beard.
- Bear?
- Beard man.
You mean a bearded man?
That's all? No name?
Beard man.
Where'd he go?
Far.
- North.
- Far.
Poor, sorry sight you are.
Hey. Want a piece of candy, Shorty?
Is that Shorty?
Hi, Will. Look who this is.
My ol' Shorty.
All done... with a real bad cracked foot.
Coigne's been here.
- Where's he at? Did you ask?
- He ruined 'im.
Traded him off.
The man's gonna get rid of him, he says, 'cause he ain't no use.
What'd he tell you of Coigne?
Just nothin'.
Coigne come here a while back.
Then he just left. Couple days ago.
The man don't know wheres neither,
'cause I asked him all them kind of things.
He don't know nothin' about it.
Just sold him a horse.
Give him poor ol' Shorty.
Hey, Will.
What's he runnin' from?
He wasn't runnin'. The man didn't say he was. Hey, Will.
Could you give me... $50?
I want this one!
Change my saddle over to this one.
Right off.
What do you want the 50 for?
Oh, you know.
So's he won't...
- Sooner or later, Coley...
- What's $50, Will?
So let him stand and eat till I get back.
I'd like to be asked my preference first.
Mr. Gashade!
You want a piece of candy, Will?
Now you begin to earn your pay.
Kingsley?
We'll see.
Plan to shoot a bit?
What if I was just to up and pull out, keep the money?
Unless I know right here and now what you're after.
You're not the only one who knows the way.
Looking for something in there?
Day and a half, near two days old.
Come on.
You sure are gettin' good at that, ma'am.
- So are you, Coley.
- Me?
So is Mr. Gashade.
We're making time.
Why are we all the time hurrying?
What's the pleasure?
I'm the one gettin' all the dust!
Oh, up in the mornin'
Toward daylight
Before I sleep
The moon shines bright
And my horse tossed me off
In a freezin' cold brook
And my horse tossed me off
Oh, I jump in the saddle
Grab hold of the horn
If I heard your name, I wouldn't know it.
Come a-ti-yi yippy-yippy-yay, yippy-yay
Come a-ti-yi, yippy-yippy-yay
- Would I?
- No.
Give a little yell
- I don't see no point to it.
- There isn't any.
What's that?
Oh, I heard it in the holler
I'm just singin'.
It's all right, Coley.
And I done real well
Till the boss said,
"Boy, go and give 'em hell"
Come a-ti-yi yippy-yippy-yay, yippy-yay
Come a-ti-yi yippy-yippy-yay
- You sure you don't wanna light down?
- How's the trail?
Pretty cold.
But you'll pick it up, won't you?
Best damn cowboy ever was born
That's what I was supposed to do, ain't it?
Not if you're a gold miner,
Mr. Gashade.
Come a-ti-yi yippy-yippy-yay, yippy-yay
Come a-ti-yi yippy-yippy-yay
Oh, stray in the herd and the boss says kill it
So I shot him in the rump with the handle of a...
Willett!
Look over yonderly.
Yes, sir.
Damn.
Might be some folk?
Maybe so.
He see us too, you think?
Oh, yeah, he see us.
What is it?
Tracks is freshening a bit.
Trail breaks off here and heads that way.
- Too bad.
- Wait. Where are you going?
Kingsley.
No! Follow that!
Well, looks to me like this 'un's headed dead into the Supuecio?
It's bad enough we gotta cross part of it to get to Kingsley.
You won't get there that way at all.
Then why would someone want to go this way?
To get theirselves lost is the only reason outside of ignorance that I can give.
We'll follow it, Mr. Gashade.
Hell, I don't see nothin'.
What are we followin' anyhow?
You think you know who laid down this trail better than I do, miss.
How do you know it's gonna show up what you after?
I just can see you, you know... all up in them goldurned pretty flax.
Hold your horse.
What's this shootin' all the time?
You're tryin' to tell someone where we at. Ain't that so?
You're so stupid.
You gon' tell me what this is all about.
- I hate you.
- She's just practicin', Will.
What's the matter with you, miss?
You got somethin' wrong?
- She look like sick, Will.
- Don't touch me!
That rider back there. Who is he?
- He's a-followin' after us.
- Light up on her, Will. Can't you see?
Oh, now look what you done. Miss?
- She's waltzin'.
- Let me help you down off.
- Stop groping at me!
- Well, you was slippin'.
I'm not!
It's just an excuse to touch me.
Will you stop staring at me!
Get back up on your horse, Mr. Gashade.
You're feeling that bad, miss, maybe you oughta light down.
How much sun is left?
An hour, maybe.
Well, we're keepin' on till dark, I guess.
You don't like her much, Will, do ya?
She ain't showing me nothin' to like.
But you're goin' along with her then 'cause she's pretty.
Hell, pretty ain't nothin'.
It'll pleasure you nothin' but the eye.
Why, a coral snake, its ring's prettier than a rainbow... but it's got a real mean way of pain in it, is the fact.
Well, I'm glad then you ain't crazy after her.
No.
It's just a... a feeling
I got to see through.
Just that.
The reason bein' 'cause I am.
And I wouldn't want us gettin' touchy over Miss...
Her.
Well, you just try and forget about her, Coley.
Because she's got other interests than you.
Sayin' what, Will?
Sayin' I pretty much believe she means to kill someone.
Will you please help me?
Would it be too much to expect that you might have some tea?
Tea? I got tea!
Tea? How 'bout that?
Ask her if she want a cold wash to her and a spoon.
I seen and got it special.
Tea. Special tea.
"Tea."
Look!
"Lei Ling's Cut Black Comfort Tea.
Forsythe, R.I."
How sweet.
What are you workin' on him for?
He's easier than you.
He don't see what I see.
Maybe he's the more useful to me.
You think that he's gonna be able... to lead you on this trail to the Supuecio?
If you won't, maybe.
Maybe nothin', miss.
He may go pantin' after you like a little doggie, but he can't lead you nowhere.
Well, he can't stop me either.
Now leave me alone and let me sleep.
- You see that how I done?
- Give me that!
You disgustingly stupid...
What's the matter? He wouldn't give the wrong signal for you this time?
Which it'd mean?
Come in or stay off?
Who's out there?
Who is it?
No, please! Don't put your hand anywhere near your gun.
He can see you.
Who the hell is out there?
Billy Spear?
What's your trouble?
Nothing, Billy.
It was a mistake.
A mistake?
He that one we seen way back, ain't he?
What she want with him?
You did somethin'.
See how she look like him?
Hell, I don't see that.
He's about as unfriend-like a thing as I ever seen.
No, sir, I don't like him.
Well, I hope you're gonna keep that to yourself, Coley.
Why should I? What do I care?
For the reason bein' that there's a hired gun if ever I seen one.
I don't want you to do nothin' to put yourself in the way of it. Okay?
Well, if you say, okay.
Shoot. Real strong on the pretty, ain't he, way he got himself up?
What's that you got there?
Aw, just a game.
You're supposed to get them little buckshot... in the feller's eyes, see?
The same into his mouth.
It's real hard to do.
I ain't been able to yet.
This is Billy Spear.
He wasn't to join us until later, but now it doesn't matter. He's here.
He'll be going on with us.
That figures.
Mr. Gashade... but does that figure us now as three or as four?
Well, let me see.
Whatever you brought him along for, one thing it ain't is for followin' sign... or you wouldn't have had to shoot up half the countryside to get him here.
So figurin' it that-a-way...
I ain't displaced and I'm still earnin' my pay.
Well, hey. You got 'em in, every one of 'em.
How 'bout that?
Hey, I got another one too... but with a nigra's face, you wanna try.
Good then. I hope we'll make an effort now to all try and get along.
So we'll get started, say, in three hours.
Say sunup.
Hey, look, miss. There's one of them pretty little blue jay birds.
Make a wish. It's a true sign of good luck.
How's that, Billy Spear?
Real sharp. Poor draw.
These are the last trees you gonna see for a while.
So if you're plannin' to shoot anything else up, then...
Yes, sir.
These here appear to be as fresh as yesterday's, miss, and there ain't no hurry to 'em.
Like they don't think they're bein' followed and they don't care.
It shouldn't take us too much longer to catch up to him, should it?
"Him," miss? I say "they."
The one we been followin' got joined a little ways back by another.
These tracks is made by two horses.
Two men?
Well, let's go.
- Hold on, miss.
- Leave me alone, Gashade.
I can see the trail easily.
I don't even need you.
Billy!
Ain't you got no wipes?
Here. You can use mine.
Move along.
Hold up!
You can feel that, can't ya, that horse goin' lame?
No, no. That ain't gonna make no difference to the horse.
Gonna make a difference to you, that's all... bein' it's your grub you're tossin' off, not mine.
You're willin' to destruct everything, even yourself.
Quit with that.
I say somethin' to you?
I don't give a curly-hair, yellow-beard, double-dog damn if you did.
I'm gonna blow your face off.
Two up on old Frazier?
Sure gonna be pretty nasty for him.
- You wanna walk?
- Nah, but hell.
Why wouldn't she get on behind me?
If you don't shake your mind loose of her,
I got no respect for you, damn it.
You don't remember her near shootin' your head off?
- Will?
- What?
I got a funny feelin'. I don't even know if to say or not.
Well, don't then.
Just try shuttin' up, damn it!
- I don't wanna lose this horse.
- Okay, okay, Willett.
I'm likely just spookin' again anyhow.
Triple them wages and triple 'em again.
I ain't goin' that far.
You moo to me one more time 'bout her... and I'm gon' knock you down without a word.
I wasn't talkin' about her.
Well, you went and give up your horse to her so easy it makes me sick.
- And here you are now a burden to mine.
- I'm sorry, Willett.
Well, just shut up. I can't take no more of ya. No, sir.
For all the dirty rotten gall and hate of a thing... that ought never above the ground be called a woman.
No, sir.
I've lost it.
Will you please go ahead now?
Take on Coley then.
Light down and change the damn packs.
No! You take him.
You wanna ride with me, boy?
Leave him.
You better be japin'.
I ain't.
Mr. Gashade, it's not a bad idea.
We'll make better time, and then we can come back for him.
You'll need this pack, Coley.
Take it off.
Will?
It's all right. You ain't stayin'.
You see? You see, just this minute, he's taking up time.
I have to insist that he stays.
Come on. Get back up here, Coley.
He'll ride ya just fine.
You see the way of it, Coley?
You'll be all right here.
You just bide it easy.
I'll come back for you.
How long you think that'll be, Will?
Bring me over the guns, boy.
Not long.
They ain't got left but one sack of grub.
And no way of knowin' it I ain't gonna lead 'em straight into hell.
Move on.
Coley?
Find some shade.
Oh, wait, miss.
Can I get my things out of there?
Oh, I almost forgot.
- Thank you, Coley.
- It's all right.
See y'all later, I guess.
You wanna ride with me, boy?
Okay. I'd soon not get left behind here like this.
How'd you like the way
I done Leland Drum?
Like I say, I'll blow it off the first word out.
Go sit down over there.
And think on this:
Far as your voice gonna carry... ain't too far for me to turn right round and hit you in the eye.
Your brain gonna fry out here.
You know that?
Oh, Willett.
It's easier to stay behind.
If I let you go too, would you go?
Do you hear what I'm saying?
I could've left anytime.
I'm talking about now.
I got my reasons for stayin'.
Reasons?
There ain't gonna be no kill.
The reason, Mr. Gashade, for a hunt is the kill.
Are you talkin' to me?
No, Billy.
Feel like you was.
It was just to myself.
I've read a person's thoughts.
Many times.
You never take those off, do you?
He talkin' to me?
Not even with a woman.
What'd he have to say?
He knows why you're here.
I wouldn't worry after your friend, you know.
He's got a real relaxin' time compared to us.
No, that's right. No worries.
He's where I want him, back there.
Clear and safe of you.
Look at that.
Wait! I'll go first now.
Billy, keep him back a way.
Who is he?
Ask her.
You know him?
She payin' you good for this?
Good as you.
Twice as much wouldn't buy you off.
Yeah, I figured you'd likely do it for nothin'.
- Nearly nothin'.
- What for?
For her?
What does she mean to you?
She liked me.
You know anything about her?
Her name even?
Ask her.
What lies in that direction?
- More of the same.
- No, but beyond that.
- Kingsley.
- You're right.
Kingsley, Gashade, not hell.
What about him?
He don't interest you?
No, not now. His leg's broken.
- Who is he?
- Just a friend.
Friend?
- Like me and him.
- Yes, like you and Billy.
Where's his horse?
I don't see no horse.
He must have wandered away.
You thinking of Coley?
Yeah. He could've used it.
Bein' as you're leavin' that poor jay a-layin' out there starin' up at the sun.
I left him some water.
Well, ain't that somethin'?
Why didn't you just shoot him?
Billy, did you ever leave behind a friend?
I never did have one.
How about you, Willett?
It's different.
He's better off where he's at.
When?
This mornin'.
- Let's eat him.
- No, Billy.
You don't want any?
It's candy.
It's all I got to give. I'm sorry.
Don't mention it.
And I'm real sorry too I can't help you none... bein' as I gotta catch
'em as fast as I can.
Yonderly?
That way, you say.
What?
Oh, oh, sure. I-I'll be back for ya.
Me and Will.
I hate to leave ya layin', you know.
Oh, say.
Here now.
You take one of these too.
Which one'd you like?
That 'un?
I'm surprised. Most people wouldn't have chose that 'un.
- What?
- Water. W...
I said it's all gone.
Quit with that. I don't like that, what you're doin'.
This horse is goin'!
So's his!
How long to catch up?
That depends on who's gonna last.
Him or you?
Will!
Come back!
Coley, don't do it!
Why did you do that?
He draw on me first.
He was gonna shoot. Ask him.
It's too bad.
But he should've stayed behind.
He didn't like me, that's why.
He should've knowed to not draw on me.
What are you doing?
I know that feeling, Gashade.
I've carried the burden of it longer than you.
That would be your final foolishness, you know.
You hate me too?
Get down.
She's fallin'. She's fallin'!
Can you see him?
Makin' for that rise.
Shoot him!
Come back and shoot him!
Slow up, damn it!
Remember, I got the water!
Don't forget!

GeneraI, s!r.
Andres! Send RaphaeI to bIock the road and bIow up the br!dge.
Hey, you! Br!ng me the papers.
One th!ng !s sure. Ram!rez knew how to make h!mseIf be Ioved.
That !s another th!ng the revoIut!on needs.
I'II name a town for h!m, after we've won.
But, to w!n, we need goId.
What d!d he teII you about the money, eh?
Noth!ng. He toId me he was go!ng to g!ve me 1 00 doIIars.
Don't joke w!th me, boy.
I want to know about the goId.
PabIo saw you taIk to h!m, before he d!ed.
You know what the s!tuat!on !s.
When Juarez reaI!zed he was
Ios!ng power. . .
. . .he gave the funds he personaIIy adm!n!stered to Ram!rez.
Ram!rez h!d the goId outs!de the country.
When he returned, he was arrested. . .
. . .before he couId teII h!s comrades where he h!d !t. Understand?
It's the goId of the revoIut!on, for the revoIut!on.
I am the revoIut!on!

500 doIIars !s not enough.
No, I want 1 ,000 doIIars.
Hands off! Don't you forget,
I am here for a bus!ness deaI.
ExactIy, my dear. We are partners, so why can't we be fr!ends, too?
Jean PauI, stop that!
I don't want you as a fr!end.

You can ga!n some t!me.
I'II hoId them off!
You won't make !t!
Run, Cuch!IIo, run! Run!

Br!ng the goId to Sant!ago.
Go w!th God, my fr!end!
I trust you, Cuch!IIo. Run. Run.
I don't understand.
It's an oId newspaper.
What's the s!gn!f!cance of that?
- He sent me.
- Who?
We don't know th!s newspaper, and we don't know th!s name.
You've been m!s!nformed.
Th!s off!ce !s where Ram!rez pr!nted !t.
And th!s !s where he h!d the goId for ^ months.
And I know aII about you, too. . .
Fernando Lopez, under-secretary of f!nance !n Juarez's government. . .
ManueI Echevar!a, cavaIry off!cer and Juarez's m!I!tary adv!sor. . .
Mateo GonzaIez, pr!nter.
I bet !t was you who set up the paper.
Who are you?
Are you w!th the sher!ff?
Open th!s trapdoor!
After you.
It was the book he aIways carr!ed w!th h!m, and those are h!s cIothes.
He d!dn't approve of us dress!ng
I!ke Amer!cans. We--
You must excuse our Iack of trust.
It !s true. Ram!rez was here. . .
. . .but we don't know anyth!ng about the goId.
What do you want?
Was there a foundry here, once?
There was a scuIptor, but he !s dead.
Just a precaut!on.
F!rst, I check up.
Then, I Iet you go.
Good afternoon. Ram!rez sent me.
You are the th!rd man
""Ram!rez sent"" today.
The th!rd man?
Cass!dy, myseIf. . .
Who !s the th!rd?
Just a precaut!on. I check up, then I Iet you go.
BeI!eve me, s!r.
Th!s !s a m!stake.
Go ahead!
I haven't done anyth!ng.
I haven't seen anyth!ng.
I wasn't there, s!r.
Look, I swear !t, I wasn't there!
Come on. Get !n there!
- By God. . .
- What a son of a b!tch.
What a co!nc!dence, eh?
Son, th!s a!n't got noth!ng to do w!th co!nc!dence.
M!ss Sergeant!
- Surpr!sed?
- Mr. Sanchez?
- Cuch!IIo.
- At your serv!ce, s!r.
I am Chr!stopher Bann!ng. . .
. . .mayor of Burton C!ty and
Penny's father.
I am very, very gIad to meet you. . .
. . .and to have you as a guest !n our c!ty.
Th!s !s mereIy a precaut!on, for your sake, to keep you safe.
My daughter has toId me the whoIe story.
My dear, dear boy. You w!II see.
You w!II be f!ne here w!th us.
- Arthur, d!d you do what I sa!d?
- Yes, s!r.
Someth!ng my daughter thought of. . .
. . .so you can meet your new fr!ends
!n a f!t and proper manner.
Dressed I!ke an Amer!can?
I chose !t myseIf.
Are you sure !t's my s!ze?
Yes.
It's for you.
- WouId you I!ke some? It's good.
- No thank you.
WeII, we'II Ieave you to f!n!sh your meaI.
But we'II come back Iater to have a I!ttIe taIk. . .
. . .a very ser!ous taIk. . .
. . .about everyth!ng.
Cuch!IIo, th!nk of aII the good we couId do together. . .
. . .w!th 3 m!II!on doIIars. . .
My dear, oh my dear, my I!fe. . .
Are you suffer!ng badIy?
I th!nk the-- the t!me has come.
I don't want the ch!Id here!
I'II k!II you!
No, he won't be born !n Texas.
No, get out of here!
Nobody needs you!
You're go!ng to hoId h!m another
3 days, unt!I we get back to Mex!co.
Don't g!ve me any troubIe.
I don't want a gr!ngo for a son!
AII r!ght, now go ahead.
For your serv!ces, I prom!se you the rank of CoIoneI !n the cavaIry. . .
Or, to put !t another way. . .
. . .the new CoIoneI R!za captures the band!t R!za. . .
. . .and takes the reward money.
I trust you. Agreed.
Do you have a Mex!can pr!soner here?
D!d you hear me?
Is there a Mex!can boy here?
My fr!end! Here, take !t!
Qu!ck! Open the Iock!
G!ve me the keys.
Good morn!ng, s!r.
- Come on.
- Come on.
After what happened !n the pr!son. . .
. . .we've dec!ded your presence
!s a danger to the town.
Th!s decree !s s!gned by the
C!ty Counc!I. . .
. . .and orders you to Ieave the town.
I'm onIy the Mayor.
I can't do anyth!ng about th!s.
But I do have a propos!t!on !n m!nd.
Penny ment!oned goId to us, a Iot of !t.
But no one has seen !t.
I th!nk we understand each other, gentIemen. . .
So, Iet's cut !t short.
You must dec!de.
E!ther taIk or get out of here.
They k!IIed-- the others. . .
Get on your horses!
To Burton C!ty!
- What's gotten !nto you?
- Stop!
I'm go!ng to burn !t down.
To heII w!th your orders,
CoIoneI Sev!gny.
But !t wasn't an order,
CoIoneI R!za, mereIy adv!ce.
I I!ke adv!ce.
Look! Th!s !s Burton C!ty.
And here we have Cuch!IIo, the gr!ngo, and the goId.
But there's aIso a coupIe of hundred c!t!zens. . .
. . .and at Ieast 50 of them can handIe a r!fIe.
They are cowards and don't know how to f!ght.
Okay. Put these 50 cowards aga!nst the waII. . .
. . .burn the!r houses, k!II the!r ch!Idren and women. . .
. . .and they'II soon become heroes.
I'II k!II them aII, w!th my own hands!
And wh!Ie you're busy k!II!ng them. . .
. . .our 2 fr!ends w!II escape w!th the goId.
Maybe that's just what they're wa!t!ng for.
What's your adv!ce? I'II I!sten.
We must f!nd a way to make the c!t!zens Ieave the town. . .
. . .Ieav!ng our 2 p!geons aIone.
- In the empty town?
- Yes, CoIoneI.
E!ther they hand over Cuch!IIo and the gr!ngo. . .
. . .or they evacuate the c!ty. . .
. . .because at m!dn!ght, when we come, whoever !s Ieft !s a dead man.
To show them we are not jok!ng. . .
. . .we w!II not!fy them !n the most unequ!vocaI way.
Unequ!vocaI?
It's d!ff!cuIt to speak I!ke a coIoneI.
We've got to ga!n t!me.
A I!ttIe goId wouId do !t, presented properIy.
An !ngot can be made out of th!s.
A watch !sn't enough.
If that's the onIy probIem. . .
Cuch!IIo, we're mak!ng an !ngot out of the watches.
Suppose they made watches out of !ngots. . .
Maybe not watches, but someth!ng eIse. . .
Th!s pr!nt!ng press hasn't been used for years.
Now, I'II show you someth!ng you w!II reaIIy I!ke.
Is !t aII goId?
A soI!d goId. . .pr!nt!ng press?
3 m!II!on doIIars!
Mother of m!ne. . .
The respons!b!I!ty was too great for us.
As you can see, we are !ncapabIe of defend!ng !t.
I onIy hope Ram!rez reaIIy d!d send you. . .
. . .because th!s goId represents the hopes of aII Mex!cans.
We must hand the men over. . .
. . .or Ieave town.
They're com!ng !n at m!dn!ght.
We have onIy a few hours.
It's haIf past s!x aIready.
What w!II we do now?
We'II hand them over.
Good !dea!
If you th!nk you can do !t.
Mayor Bann!ngton, we had an appo!ntment. You're a I!ttIe Iate.
Th!s !s a sampIe, a g!ft.
Now, I have a propos!t!on.
- Where !s Cuch!IIo?
- He's !n a safe pIace.
Where?
Leave town.
Stay away unt!I tomorrow morn!ng. . .
. . .but take your possess!ons w!th you on your wagons.
You must make !t Iook I!ke a reaI exodus.
Me and Cuch!IIo w!II wa!t here for
R!za. We have a pIan.
When you come back, we w!II be aI!ve. . .
. . .and the goId w!II st!II be here.
I f!gured you were h!d!ng out here, but I haven't toId anyone.
I've found a way to get you out of Burton C!ty.
But what about Cass!dy?
He w!II take care of R!za.
It was h!s !dea.
If !t doesn't succeed, !t's not !mportant.
He's a s!nner.
You w!II be uncomfortabIe, but I've got a carr!age. . .
. . .and I'II h!de you under the seat.
No one w!II f!nd you.
Don't worry.
Yeah, baby.
And then we'II come back.
. . .If onIy they aII k!II each other. . .
WeII, we must pIace fa!th
!n d!v!ne prov!dence.
Is the goId h!dden !n a safe pIace?
Can't you teII me where !t !s?
No?
It doesn't matter. I trust you.
When we come back--
We are go!ng to make a Iot of good together, aren't we?
That, too. Later. . .
. . .after we've taken care of ourseIves, f!rst.
WeII then. . .
. . .I'II wa!t for you w!th the carr!age beh!nd the pr!nt shop !n 1 0 m!nutes.
You'II see, I'II make you happy.
I'II take care of you.
You won't have to worry, ever aga!n.
I'II th!nk about everyth!ng.
You can reIax.
I th!nk I've found a way to get the goId out of town.
Boys, Cass!dy has conv!nced the Mayor to Ieave town.
You can take the pr!nt!ng press w!th you.
You shouId put !t on a wagon w!th the rest of your stuff. . .
. . .and head r!ght to the border.
But !t's dangerous. Those band!ts w!II never Iet us pass.
They'II search the wagon.
I don't th!nk !t's dangerous.
Nobody !s go!ng to th!nk anyth!ng about you. . .
. . .w!th your own equ!pment.
G!ve us a I!ttIe t!me.
We'II have to th!nk !t over.
But. . .
Not even a I!fet!me !s enough for you to come to a dec!s!on. . .
. . .because you're cowards!
You're h!d!ng out here, !n th!s rathoIe, wa!t!ng for the revoIut!on.
But the revoIut!on w!II never come. . .
. . .unt!I each one of you Iets !t burst out, from !ns!de.
Comrades, th!s !s the moment of truth.
Your moment of truth.
You are r!ght.
We'II go through w!th !t.
Good. Here we go.
WeII, goodbye, and good Iuck.
You don't get !t?
The wagon w!II pass onIy !f we stay here as ba!t.
Stay here? As ba!t?
You stay here and be ba!t.
Because Cuch!IIo !s Ieav!ng town and my guard!an angeI toId me how.
Why? You're not a coward.
You know how to f!ght and f!ght weII.
I know, but I don't I!ke !t.
I'm a peacefuI man at heart.
Born !n another country, another t!me, my kn!fe wouId have cut onIy bread.
Cuch!IIo. Th!s !s aIso your moment of truth.
What are you do!ng? Leave me aIone?
Cuch!IIo!
Cuch!IIo's not Ieav!ng.
It !sn't true.
I don't beI!eve !t.
Why d!dn't he teII me?
Th!s w!II have to stay empty.
Now go.
- Why?
- He sa!d he prefers to stay here.
Penny! What are you do!ng? Come on!
R!za! Look what I found!
Everyone !s Ieav!ng and th!s one wants to go !n.
Who are you?
Why d!d you come here?
They'II be here !n a m!nute.
They'II probabIy come from both s!des.
I'II try to stop them here.
You take that s!de.
We'II make for the chapeI.
I've h!dden two horses there. Okay?
If you need weapons, go to the generaI store.
Don't bother to pay.
Cass!dy. . .
Get go!ng.
Get go!ng. . .
Cuch!IIo. . .
What?
Noth!ng.
K!II them, w!th feeI!ng, !f you I!ke. . .
K!II a Iot of them!
Mama M!a!
Cass!dy!
Cass!dy! Cass!dy!
Cass!dy!
Coward!
You coward!
V!rg!n of GuadaIupe. . .
SpI!t up!
Let them k!II each other.
We'II Iook for the goId.
- Where do we start?
- I just reaI!zed someth!ng.
Both Cass!dy and Cuch!IIo were arrested !n that bu!Id!ng.
Let's go.
Spread out!
Strange.
That wagon was carry!ng an oId, useIess pr!nt!ng press. . .
. . .and th!s one !s brand new.
G!ve me the Iamp.
After that wagon!
Those damned pr!nters!
CarefuI! Stay cIose to the waII.
Cuch!IIo! You hear me?
Leave your kn!ves beh!nd and come out!
I have a IoveIy present for you!
Cuch!IIo! Don't come out!
Don't come out, run away!
Shut up!
Cuch!IIo!
Don't come out!
Run away, Cuch!IIo!
I toId them you were here, but they prom!sed not to touch you!
Run, Cuch!IIo, run!
Th!s !s reaIIy touch!ng. . .
. . .but !f you run away,
I w!II k!II her. . .
. . .and I don't I!ke th!s.
I want to k!II men.
I prefer to k!II you!
Cuch!IIo!
And the gr!ngo?
He deserted you, eh?
The son-of-a-b!tch !s m!Ies away, w!th the goId.
R!za! R!za, I have some bad news for you.
F!rst, I'm here!
Second, my gun !s po!nted r!ght on your back.
Now !t's on your forehead.
Okay, gr!ngo. Don't move.
Run, run!
Sorry, R!za.
There was another b!t of bad news.
I had 2 guns a!med at you.
- Where's Cass!dy?
- He'II be aII r!ght.
Are you Ieav!ng h!m here?
We need to get to the wagon before !t's too Iate.
Watch out, Cuch!IIo!
Don't move. On your knees!
Cowards! You rotten cowards!
You wouId shoot h!m !n the back, on h!s knees. . .
. . .because you don't have the guts to face h!m!
He couId spI!t your head w!th one shot.
She's just try!ng to provoke you.
Shoot h!m and be done w!th !t!
What are you wa!t!ng for?
We've got t!me.
CoIoneI Garc!a's troops aren't
!n s!ght yet.
S!nce we represent the government, we must st!ck to the ruIes.
In any case, you can be the referee.
Stop! Stop there, Cuch!IIo!
Th!s !sn't the r!ght d!stance for a kn!fe f!ght.
It's you who chose the kn!fe.
I chose the gun.
Take a step forward!
Two more!
Is that okay, Cuch!IIo?
A I!ttIe b!t more!
R!fIe d!stance!
At th!s po!nt, I w!n.
You know what I mean?
Why take r!sks?
You wouIdn't k!II a man !n coId bIood. . .
. . .wouId you?
I don't have enough kn!ves for aII those peopIe.
Cuch!IIo!
Take the wagon.
We'II head off the others down there.
DoIores, I!sten.
Take th!s wagon and r!de to
S!erra San M!gueI. . .
. . .and br!ng th!s personaIIy to
GeneraI Sant!IIana.
Where shaII we meet?
In about 2 or 3 weeks, go to Ram!rez C!ty.
Ask for the square that bears my name, and I'II be there.
You what?!
Look, Cuch!IIo. It's me who's got the money.
If you want a house, a horse, and a stabIe, you must come to me, now!
Very weII. We don't have t!me now.
Go, go, go! Goodbye!
You're r!ght! I never wouId have shot you !n coId bIood.
Thanks for warm!ng !t up for me.
Let's spI!t up and make them foIIow us.
I'II cross the border to Texas.
What about you?
You'II be abIe to make !t?
Eh, Amer!cano, I know how to run.
Want to bet?
I'm bett!ng on you, Cuch!IIo.
I bet 3 m!II!on doIIars!
M!nus the 1 ,000 doIIars of goId Ietters you took from the pr!nt!ng press.
You heard DoIores. A man needs money to keep h!s freedom.
You're r!ght.
Anyway, keep th!s to remember me.
That's !t! Come on!
Run!
- Goodbye, hombre!
- Goodbye, my fr!end!
Run, Cuch!IIo, run!
Long ago there lived a people, unique in all history, the Mayans.
Greece and Rome had become ancient legends in ancient books,
and the European civilizations had entered into the age of the barbarian.
But in the tropical jungles of Central America,
a civilization had burst into full flower.
Without metals, without horses, without wheels,
these incredible people built roads, pyramids,
temples worthy of ancient Egypt.
They charted the heavens,
devised a higher system of mathematics than the Romans,
and created a calendar as accurate as the one we use today.
But despite the maturity of their art and their science,
in the most important part of their lives,
the worship of their gods, they remained primitive.
Balam, the jaguar, eight times king!
Balam, the prince!
NARRATOR. To the Mayans, the gods were demanding gods, fierce and greedy,
granting nothing except for a price, and that price was blood.
ln their profound desire to win favor from the deities,
the Mayans made human sacrifice the keystone of their religion.
To die as a bearer of a message to the gods
was the most exalted honor a man could experience,
for when he was selected to be sacrificed, in that moment, he himself became a god.
He was worshiped as a god, granted any wish that came into his heart,
until the moment he was put to death.
NARRATOR. For centuries, in small, scattered kingdoms,
these people lived in peace with themselves and their gods.
But then came conquerors from the West,
with metal swords, which made them invincible
against the wooden weapons of the Mayans.
One by one, they swallowed up the little kingdoms,
until the last, the final stronghold,
Chichén ltzá was theirs.
And their leader, Hunac Kell, already as cruel as any god,
now felt himself as powerful as one.
I have served your father, and I have loved you as a son.
Now I shall serve you and love you as my king.
Balam ! Nine times king!
Balam, the jaguar, nine times king!
There is still time to let Hunac Kell know that the Mayans are men.
No!
You must flee and preserve your life.
And become a coward before Hunac Kell?
You no longer belong to yourself, Balam.
You belong to your people.
-And how do I serve them? By deserting?
-Dead, you desert your people.
There's a time for fighting and a time to make ready to fight.
He speaks wisely.
Let us lick our wounds, and then make the invader choke on his sword.
There is no place to run.
Hunac Kell and his men will scour the land.
If we are going to die, let us die here.
I’ve said your life is not yours to lose.
You're a king.
Act like a king!
We'll disperse, join forces when we're strong again.
Disperse?
No, that's the one thing we must never do.
My father once told me of an ancient legend, of the time of the great earthquakes when the land shook like the sea, and men took to boats and crossed the waters to the North.
Cross the waters?
We'd slide off the world.
The legend has no truth.
There's no record of it on any stele.
My father told it to me, Priest.
Ah Haleb.
There is a fishing village on the coast not 10 days journey from here.
We will leave from there.
Men do not vanish into air.
There is a hidden passage.
Find it, and find the body of the king and of his son as well.
Until I know that not one drop of that blood remains alive,
I am not King of Chichén ltzá. ls your village near?
This is your king, Balam.
Answer.
It's just beyond that point.
We'll take to the boats and cross the great sea.
But you will all die.
The legend says nothing about boats coming back.
The legend does say that land was found.
Who brought back the word?
But why do your soldiers take our fish?
The catch will be useful to us on the voyage.
-How many boats do you have?
-What you see there.
We will need all of them.
-The king has means of payment?
-No. But it will please the gods.
And be very displeasing to the boat owners.
Seize this man who puts men before gods.
Wait!
You do acknowledge that I am your king?
Kings have always seemed far away.
Small in the distance like wars.
And defeated kings even smaller.
Listen, old man, tell your people to fill every boat with supplies and anything else that will be useful to us in the new land.
-But how will we live after you go?
-Your people are coming with me.
To cross the water to their death?
If crossing the waters frightens you, then you know little of Hunac Kell.
Every soldier that you see here was once a hundred, and their women are now slaves.
To my people, slavery may sound better than the unknown.
I have ordered you and your people to come with me.
Now tell them ! ln spite of your youth, you have the habit of command, but habit is not always enough.
You dare to disobey?
This is Balam, king and son of kings to the ninth generation.
And a stranger here.
My people respect the voice they know.
-Then give them the word.
-If I refuse?
-Ordinarily, I kill only as a duty.
-Leave him !
-Who is this girl?
-My daughter, Ixchel.
Instruct your father, he does not argue with the king.
And has the king the right to order our people to their death?
Until today this was a place of peace.
I will not surrender to Hunac Kell.
We must go to a new land and grow strong and then come back.
Men alone cannot build a new race in a new land.
That is why I need your people, your women and your children.
Now tell them to get into the boats.
You are a new king, Balam, young and brave and untried.
If my people go with you, they will have many doubts and great fears.
You should have someone at your side whom they know and love.
I do not wear my father's crown to share it with you.
Not with me, Balam.
With your queen, my daughter, Ixchel.
When the time comes,
I shall choose my own queen.
To my people, I am as royal as you, so is my daughter.
Priests and soldiers in a womanless land.
Are you destined to be king of a dying race, Balam?
Hunac Kell. Less than a league away.
Hunac Kell is not a league away.
You have not felt his wrath, we have.
He is completely without mercy.
His strength is a sword of metal, and we are powerless against it.
So you have no choice.
If we are all to survive, you must come with me at once.
So I order you, gather your belongings and go to the boats.
-Obey your king!
-They await my word.
-Then give it.
-After you have given me yours.
Will your greed settle for nothing less, old man?
-Nothing less.
-We could take all of his people by force.
And be another Hunac Kell?
Very well.
If I live, I will marry her in the new land.
-The king vows this?
-By the gods, I swear it.
Obey the king!
Why did you do that?
Do you think I have no pride?
When you share his throne, you will have no need to speak of pride.
Hurry! Load as fast as you can!
BALAM: Hurry!
-Leave him ! Leave him !
-Please!
Away!
No! No!
The sea is not big enough to keep us apart, Balam.
Wherever you go, I will find you!
Ixchel, I’ve tried so many times to tell you,
I do grieve with you for the death of your father.
Yet there was a time when you wanted it yourself.
The enemy killed your father, Ixchel, not the king.
And who brought the enemy upon us?
When a man must think of many, it's not easy to think of one.
Oh, God of Waters, the winds forsake us, our men weaken and die.
I plead with you, do not abandon us.
We've lost another boat.
The god of the waters has abandoned us.
Turn back before it's too late.
You know the danger that lies behind.
There cannot be greater danger ahead. lt is not our lives Hunac Kell wants, it's yours, Balam.
Fear presses down upon you, Priest.
Why not use your power? Pray for wind!
Balam, listen to me, as you'd have listened to your father.
I now believe this voyage was doomed from the moment we did not make sacrifice.
There are things that belong to the gods, Balam.
And things that belong to man. ln the name of all that we hold sacred, give the word to turn back or I will.
-Do so and it will be your last.
-I, too, say we should go back.
BALAM: Go back to what?
An honorable death.
Once we both wanted that.
Must we all die for you, Balam?
Women and children, too?
There is new land beneath our feet and a new life lies before us.
Let us then begin with new feelings in our hearts, old fears and old memories to be forgotten.
From this time on, it shall be as though we are reborn.
Before we left the old land, I made a vow, that if we arrived here safely,
I would make Ixchel my queen.
Now, before all of you, I keep my word.
Priest, as the first act in this new land, prepare to perform this marriage as soon as possible.
There will be no need.
You were forced to take that vow.
Nonetheless it is sacred.
And that vow was made to my father.
And to these people who bore witness to it. lt was made to everyone but me.
But no longer need you feel the prisoner of a promise.
My father is dead, and I release you from that vow.
There is much to be done.
We must clear the land, build a temple to our gods and houses for ourselves.
Our task will be hard.
But with faith, we shall endure.
Oh, God, lord of hills and valleys, be patient with us for we are about to destroy your beauty.
Suffer it, we pray you, so that we may dwell here and obtain our daily bread, for in us there is a great hunger.
Send us the many blessings of thy bounty, the life-giving sun, the blessed rain, the fertility of the soil.
We pray you to suffer no animal to attack us, nor enemy to kill us. lt is a sense I have.
Because we saw one canoe does not mean invaders have come.
The canoe is like none we've ever seen.
Where there is one there could be many.
As your chief,
I say strange boats carry strange people.
If the council agrees,
I will search for these strangers.
If I find them, I will bring back one.
Isatai, you will come with me.
One may have to watch, the other must return with word to the council.
We have been looking for these strangers for more than five times this number of days.
-And we'll look more.
-Maybe there are no strangers.
Maybe there was nothing more than a big canoe.
Then we'll find that out.
-There is no need for you to do this.
-My place is with my people.
Now they're Balam's people.
You should be their queen.
Ixchel, your father was wiser than that.
A king is a lonely man, perhaps the loneliest man on earth.
Your father understood that.
He knew that for Balam to rule wisely he needed someone at his side.
Someone he could confide in, trust and love.
Both of you are lonely.
If he is lonely, why doesn't he tell me himself?
How much longer must you keep our farmers piling dirt when they should be planting corn?
Until the temple is completed,
I cannot determine the day the gods will favor our planting.
And there's been no rain.
Perhaps it never rains here.
We will not have to wait for rain.
Come with me.
Ixchel works harder than any.
I told her she belongs with you. lt is no concern of yours, Priest.
My concern is with everyone here, beginning with the king.
Before everyone I offered her marriage and before everyone she made...
Because of a vow.
She's a woman. Go to her again.
-I am a king, I cannot plead.
-She will listen.
To degrade me again?
I have in mind to build a wall of stone here so that the water will be held back.
And then to dig ditches from here to the fields.
And then we'll never have to depend upon rain.
BALAM:
This, I think, would be the place to start. lt may be done, Balam, but first you must sacrifice.
This stream will become the lifeblood of our village.
The God of Waters must be given a life in honest exchange.
All work on the pyramid must, for the moment, stop until we have built this wall of stone and prepared the fields for planting.
That is my command.
Tell your people that Black Eagle has taken your chief, and my warriors will destroy the rest of you.
Let him live.
We have our offering to the God of Waters.
The barbarian has a killing wound but he seems too strong to die.
I have felt that strength.
But how do we know the offering of a barbarian will please the gods?
We are strangers here, he is of this land.
No one could better serve our need.
And we must see to it that he is made well.
Where there's one there must be others, perhaps thousands and every one of them looking for their chief.
Post guards around the village and send out more searchers. lt will be done.
You have done enough for today.
You may go.
Ixchel.
There is...
There is something
I have wanted to tell you.
I have wanted to tell you that I know how hard you work.
All of your people work very hard and I am grateful.
I will tell them.
-He will let no one near him.
-It's like trying to help a wild animal.
Go back to him and heal his wounds.
A life offered to the gods must be a whole one.
He frightens me.
I will try.
Say nothing of the sacrifice.
He will be informed at the appointed time and in the appointed way.
He's like a wild animal because he's being treated like one.
Remember, he tried to kill the king.
And remember that your high priest has chosen him for sacrifice and he should be properly honored.
Rest easy, Balam.
If the barbarians are out there, the searchers will find them.
I only remember how Black Eagle appeared like a spirit, from nowhere.
When I am asleep, my eyes cannot see you.
During the long time of darkness it seemed that I had died.
I hate death.
I remembered the living.
I was angry, it was taken from me.
Then I saw a woman.
I reached out and touched her.
And then I knew I was alive.
But why?
Why am I alive?
Why are you healing me?
Why?
Please sleep now.
Now I will sleep.
Black Eagle was right.
They are people such as we have never seen before.
They live in a big place by the sea.
Their dwellings are made of wood and stone and are fastened to the ground.
They have built a tall mound of earth.
That mound will guide us to where we will avenge our chief.
-How is Black Eagle?
-With me, as violent as ever.
Only Ixchel can touch him.
You look tired, Ixchel.
-Because of you I understand he will live.
-I will.
I will not disappoint you.
And I promise you a much better fight than the last.
You have skill I have not known.
-Where do you come from?
-From across the great sea.
-What do you want on my land?
-To live here.
This land belongs to my people.
There have been many intruders before and we have always driven them away.
But if your warriors have some of your skill, then this will be the greatest battle of all.
Balam, practice with your sword, you will need it.
Balam.
Your woman is beauty.
Why do you call me his woman?
Because he is chief and you are the most beautiful woman here.
You haven't seen many of the others.
I don't have to see.
I know.
You must lie down now.
What do you give me now? lt is from our land. lt will make you well.
Balam is a good fighter but he is a fool.
Why do you say that?
If you are not his woman, then he is a fool.
And it would be good to fight for that, too.
I am a man of faith, Priest, but you must know
I have no love for human sacrifice.
I questioned it in our land and I question it even more here.
Why must this man be put to death, Priest?
A sacrifice to the gods is not a personal matter.
It's a holy act for the good of our people.
Your feelings are of no importance.
As king you will have to do many things you may not like.
When you do them for your people, without hesitation, then you will be truly king.
You will instruct him to put these on.
He will ask why.
As soon as he's properly attired, we will answer.
BLACK EAGLE:
Such a long time you were gone.
-For you.
-For me? Why? lt came with us across the water. lt has great beauty.
Our people can do many things.
Your people.
Can your people jump on a buffalo and ride it?
-What is a buffalo?
-lt is a bull as tall as this house, its horns long as my arms, when it runs the earth shakes.
And our babies lead them around by their noses.
How can your babies reach so high?
You haven't seen our babies.
Why am I being given this?
-To honor you.
-Honor?
A ceremony?
I know.
Your king has decided to let me return to my people. lt is true.
Balam is not only brave, but wise, too.
I will carry back good words.
And when I leave,
I want you to come with me.
No one has ever been as gentle with me as you, Ixchel.
And I have come to love you.
I want you for my wife.
And someday we will watch our babies lead buffalo around by their noses.
Ixchel.
-Speak, Priest.
-Yes.
Tell me of the ceremony.
Our religion teaches that we may send messengers to our gods to offer our prayers, our hopes, to ask for good things for our people.
Black Eagle, you have been chosen to bear our words.
The man thus chosen to look upon our gods is honored before all other men.
He becomes himself a god.
Our people already look on you as more than human.
They offer prayers in your name.
-Prayers?
-You'll be taken to the stone of sacrifice, and thereafter you will live with the gods for all eternity.
You knew.
And Ixchel, she knew, too.
The time for the sacrifice has been set for tomorrow.
Until then you may have anything in our power to give.
A child born to you now would have the qualities of a god. lt would grace our people.
Any of our maidens would be blessed if you summoned her to be your bride.
Ixchel.
Send me Ixchel. lt is time to prepare to unite Black Eagle with Ixchel.
I will not permit it.
Your people trust you, Balam.
Do not betray them.
As your king,
I am required to inform you that...
That Black Eagle has summoned you.
Yes, I know.
You must be very honored.
Deeply honored.
Then go.
He might've said one word.
One single word.
He wished Black Eagle had chosen another.
-She went without question, Priest.
-What could she question?
She might have said that she'd wished she'd not been so...
So honored.
You did not try to stop her?
No.
You are a king, Balam.
The last time you came here you brought me a cape of many feathers.
I held you in my arms and asked you to be my wife.
Now you come here as my bride but not the way I asked.
My bride, until tomorrow, when your priests will come to kill me.
Honor?
Slaughtered.
-Slaughtered for superstition.
-No.
But father a god for you first, then make your crops grow with my blood and be honored. lt is being honored. It's our religion. lt is not the dying, it is the manner of it.
You robbed me of a warrior's death.
You brought me back to life.
You allowed me to believe
I was returning to my people.
You let me love you.
Father a god!
But I don't want a son who is a god.
I only want a son who will be brave as a child leading buffalo around by the nose.
Then why did you ask for me?
I wanted you to feel my hate, as I once wanted you to feel my love.
You sent her away.
I want nothing from any of you.
-The time has come.
-AH ZOK: He refuses to wear this.
Soon you will be a Mayan god. lt is fitting that you dress as one.
If the spirits in your heavens can change me into a god, they can change my clothes as well.
You will carry this petition in the name of our king and of our people.
We ask only peace and the fruits of our labor, the blessings of the sun and the rain and of the richness of the earth.
Blessings of the sun and the rain.
Richness of the earth.
You are fools.
Look around you, Balam.
The grass has always grown for us and the trees spread their branches, the rivers have flowed and my people have always enjoyed these blessings.
My people are the fiercest on earth.
Our land is red with the blood of our enemies.
But never, never have we shed one drop of blood in sacrifice.
And never have we groveled in fear.
And I tell you this, Balam.
Never, so long as I breathe one breath of life, will I ever submit to this.
You will carry our message.
But not to our gods, to your people.
We asked for peace. We still ask for it.
Peace?
That choice will have to lie with my people.
Go to them and carry my words.
I give you your freedom.
Take it.
Balam, I have tried to make you know.
You cannot bring this new life to our people without first giving a life.
For a thousand years we've been bound by this law.
The gods cannot be cheated.
AH HALEB: Barbarians!
Soldiers to your posts.
Women to your houses.
-I have set him free.
-Release him.
When he rejoins his people, their strength will be doubled.
The king has set him free. Open the gates.
There was something in what he said that made me trust him.
Yet the man who was closest to me on earth is dead, and the man who swore to destroy us lives.
For the first time in many days my eyes are happy.
Why did they let you go?
They let me go because their chief wants peace.
They must be cowards! They fear us!
No, they are no cowards.
They fear no one but their gods.
You have chosen me to be your chief, not to command but to guide you.
Now, these are my words.
There have been other intruders in our land, but never people such as these.
They have wisdom that is different from ours.
They have skills, knowledge.
I am thinking we can learn from these people, if we live at their side in peace.
We have never lived at the side of any intruder.
-I speak for war.
-ALL: War! Yes! War!
War! War! War! War! War!
As long as I'm your chief you will listen to my words.
When those words do not reach your hearts, then it is your right to look among you, and choose a new chief.
Go back to your house.
They've chosen war.
Load.
Wait.
Balam.
My people call themselves,
''Wanderers on the Earth,'' but where this large fire burns, it means that Black Eagle is there, and the wanderers have come to rest.
And where did they get the wood for this fire?
Look at our stockade.
We needed firewood and we took it.
We always take what we need.
If we are to live together in peace, there must be no wall between us.
Balam, I will try to make my people understand that they must change some of their ways and learn some of yours.
And we have much to learn from you.
The last time I saw your village,
I was a prisoner.
Now I would like to see it with new eyes.
This is the writing I spoke of.
What is he putting down now?
He is telling how we journeyed across the waters to a new land, and of the new people we have met.
-About me?
-Yes.
Which one is me?
The crops, they grow in this new land.
MAN: The crops, they grow, they grow!
See that they do no damage. lt seems the gods received your message, even though
Black Eagle never delivered it.
The crops grow faster in this new land than they did at home.
And without human blood to nourish them.
Have you forgotten so soon about Ah Min?
That he gave his life for this?
I have not forgotten Ah Min.
But we made this field ready, we planted the seed, and we brought the water.
This crop grew without sacrifice.
How can you make
Ah Min's death seem so worthless?
He loved you.
And I loved him.
And I wish he were here now to see this.
You see how the king denies our religion.
If he is not stopped, he will bring destruction on all of us.
What strange skins.
-Where did they come from?
-We hunted them.
We've never seen such animals.
-Aren't they beautiful?
-If you like them.
If you had hunted these animals yourself, you'd have a higher opinion of them.
I look upon you as one of us, as one of my people.
Remember all those times in my hut when we were alone,
I asked you to be my woman and bear my sons.
But you didn't answer me.
Your lips are not sealed anymore, Ixchel.
Say now you will be my bride.
Go to him ! Be his woman! Bear his sons!
Before when he summoned you, you went to him willingly.
And now I know it was not for the first time.
Balam, wait.
Balam !
No!
Our people cannot live together.
There is a wall between us.
Being rooted like trees never was meant for us.
I take my people to where we belong, where there is no roof but the sky, where there are no walls to the edges of the earth.
I take them to where birds sing for us, and where we live free like the deer.
I would go with you.
I'd never leave your side except...
Balam.
I'm proud that you would fight for me and grateful.
But I know what I felt when I thought he was going to die.
After his words to you he should have died.
But his words were the first words he ever used to tell me that he loved me.
AH HALEB: Hunac Kell.
Balam's old enemy with metal swords has found him.
They will destroy Balam.
-Sound the battle drums.
-ISATAI: I thought you wanted him dead.
Until now, so did I.
Our king defies the gods and we are powerless against him.
He is at the root of all our troubles.
But if Balam were dead, you could lead us, and we could still make our peace with Hunac Kell.
Balam, if you surrender,
I will spare your people!
Your life, Balam, for the lives of your people!
If you do not surrender, every man, woman and child will perish!
BALAM: Pitz!
PITZ: Archers, make way.
Stand!
Balam !
Not even you can heal this.
Speak to your people, Balam.
BALAM: Hunac Kell is dead.
The way to our homeland lies open.
But now, I look upon what we have here.
The grass grows, the trees spread their branches, and the rivers flow.
And we have not spilled one drop of blood in sacrifice to the gods.
Can it not be that the gods are satisfied with the sacrifices that each of us must make in his day-to-day life, that the test of a people is in the living, not the dying, and living in dignity and decency and respect is all that the gods require?
As for me, I remain here, but in Black Eagle's way,
I give you your choice.
You may stay or you may go.
But if you choose to stay, it will be without this.
ALL: Balam, the jaguar, nine times king!
You never taught me to write, and I never taught you to hunt.
And yet there are many things we have learned from each other.
Don't be a fool the rest of your life, Balam.
Ixchel is your woman.
She has always been.
And now, more so than ever.
This land has a name today
and is marked on maps.
But the names and the marks and the land
all had to be won.
Won from nature and from primitive man.
Five generations ago,
a mere 125 years back...
... this land was known
only as the West.
Known only to a handful of white men...
... lonely trappers wandering its vastness
in search of beaver.
They were known as mountain men,
a new breed.
Men like Jim Bridger,
Franchère and Sublette, Linus Rawlings.
More Indian than the Indians
in all but blood.
They held to no law but their own...
... drifted free as the clouds,
settled nowhere, kept forever on the move.
Their mocassined feet and unshod horses
leaving no trace on the land.
Like the Indians,
with whom they were at peace...
... they wanted nothing beyond
what they found, and little of that.
The mountains, the forests,
the harsh country...
... were as unchanging to them
as the stars...
... and just as unyielding.
Far behind the mountains,
beyond the rolling plains...
... they had left the people of the East,
people who were restless in another way.
The kind who'd look at a mountain
and see a watershed...
... look at a forest
and see lumber for houses...
... look at a stony field and see a farm.
Their faces and their instincts
had been turned to the West...
... ever since Plymouth Rock
and Jamestown.
The trapper's road was the trail
of a wolf or the bend of a canyon.
But for whole families
chaffing to follow the sun...
... there had to be broader ways.
There were no roads into the wilderness,
only rivers.
And they flowed in the wrong direction:
North or south.
Or else they stopped at the Alleghenies.
Until one day, a new river took source
in the mind of a man named DeWitt Clinton.
He conceived of a river
that would go west.
And in the way Americans have
of acting out their dreams, it came to be.
The Erie Canal left the Hudson
above Albany...
... and carried clear across
to the Great Lakes.
People who yearned for virgin land
and a new life...
... now had a highway to take them.
And they moved along.
Pride of Utica now loading!
All aboard for the Pride of Utica!
The Ramsey family, Peter Smith...
...the Skoga family!
All eight of them!
All aboard for the Pride of Utica!
Is the laddie's health the reason you're heading west?
Partly.
Only partly.
Mostly our trouble East was rocks.
I had me a farm where some years
I'd raise 100 bushels of rocks to the acre.
Zebulon, you hadn't ought to lie to the man like that.
Wife, I'm a God-fearing soul, and I tell the truth as I see it.
Now, I never used a plow.
I'd blast out the furrows with gunpowder.
And then one morning,
I hauled the bucket up out of the well...
...and so help me, the bucket was full of rocks.
Rocks.
I just stood there right still trying not to blaspheme.
I said to myself,
"You've got a son that's ailing...
...you've got a daughter what won't take to herself a husband."
- There she sits there, mooning as usual.
- Pa.
You've got another who don't seem quite right in the head.
Lilith?
Yes, Pa?
Now, I'll remind you, sir.
I'm still standing there holding a bucket full of rocks...
...and staring into a bleak old age.
So I made me a vow right then and there. I said:
"If I can find a man with $500 who likes rocks...
...then there's gonna be another fool owning this farm."
Well, sir, the Lord provided such a man...
...and here I am.
He ain't told you one word of truth,
Mr. Harvey.
We had the best farm in the township.
Yeah, Rockville Township it was.
Stone County.
Oh, it was not.
It was his itching foot that brought us here.
Heaven knows where we'll end up.
Oh, these are my laddies.
Angus, Brutus and Colin.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
I think they're already acquainted with your daughters.
- Be they single?
- Aye, single so far.
Well, this Illinois country's beginning to sound better to me.
Lilith?
Lilith, here. Strike up a little tune for these handsome lads.
- Oh, I ain't in no mood, Pa.
- Lilith, there's a time for coaxing...
...this ain't the time.
All right.
All right.
A captain bold in Halifax
Who lived in country quarters
Betrayed a maid who hanged herself
One morning in her garters...
Lilith.
Now, you know better than to sing a song like that.
- What ones do you know?
- We know "Yankee Doodle."
- "Yankee Doodle"?
- Their mother's dead.
They haven't had much learning in the social graces.
All right, give them
"A Home in the Meadow."
Eve, come on, you too.
That's it.
Come on, join in.
That's it.
Come on.
Stop.
Loading for the Flying Arrow!
All aboard for the Flying Arrow!
- The Prescott family!
- Here we be. Come on.
Alec Harvey and three sons!
Jeffrey Rose and family!
But the canal was only the first step
toward the promised land.
The next steps were longer and harder.
Those who could raise the fare
went by steamboat to the end of the line.
Others found a cheaper way
to head for Ohio, Illinois...
... and the open spaces beyond.
Lilith. Lilith, listen to this:
"Theirs was a poignant parting in the forest.
The handsome young backwoodsman carved two hearts on a tree trunk...
...then from ten paces, hurled a knife at the junction of the two hearts."
Junction. What's that?
Well, that's where the two hearts meet.
Now, listen:
"His marksmanship was uncanny.
Three times he hurled the knife on target.
'That was for luck,, he said the first time.
'That was for love. Deep, divine love" he said the second.
And the third time, 'That was a prayer, a plea for love undying."'
Isn't that beautiful?
I reckon. If anybody ever talks like that.
Well, it's the sentiments, not the talk.
There ain't no sense to you, Eve.
You wanna to be a farm wife, but you don't wanna marry a farmer.
Neither do you.
Of course not.
I don't wanna have nothing to do with farms.
I want silk dresses and fine carriages and a man to smell good.
What I want's back East, not West.
But I'll get there yet. You watch.
You don't know what you want yet.
It's the man that counts, not where he lives.
- Ready, now?
Ready.
Daddy, Daddy, something coming upriver.
Hostile Indians, I suspect.
- Could it be river pirates, Zebulon?
- Don't know.
They say no honest man travels this river at night.
I can only see one man, Pa.
I hear that's a favorite pirate trick.
They hide in the bottom of the boat...
...till they're ready to jump you.
- Get my gun, Colin.
- All right, Pa.
Just come in slow and easy, stranger.
And keep your hands where we can see them.
Name's Linus Rawlings.
I'm hungrier than sin and real peaceful like.
- What have you got in the craft?
- Beaver pelts.
I said beaver pelts.
I never had a chance to see a beaver pelt,
Mr. Rawlings.
Well, in that case, ma'am,
I'll show you one.
There you are.
That's real soft.
It's a fine pelt, ma'am.
Now, my apologies, sir.
- We was afeared you might be a pirate.
- I ain't no pirate.
Come on, let's have supper and get acquainted.
No, no, no. That's yours.
Keep that, ma'am.
Well, you sure set your cap in a hurry.
Is he the backwoodsman you've been waiting for?
More than likely he's got a wife and six kids waiting for him.
Thank you, ma'am, that was right tasty.
You've only had four plates.
I was beginning to think you didn't like it.
Well, it don't pay to eat too much on an empty stomach, ma'am.
How come you're to be traveling so late at night?
Well, I'm kind of anxious to get to Pittsburgh.
I ain't seen a city for a long time.
I aim to whoop it up a little.
Well, now, we've never seen a mountain man before.
Tell me, them Rocky Mountains as high as they say?
Well, now, I just don't rightly know.
I never climbed one. I've...
Uh...
Well, you know, that just ain't exactly true.
Jim Bridger and me...
...we started up one of them little-bitty
Rocky Mountain foothills, you know.
And then, one day, we see this fella...
...and he has a great big pair of white wings...
...and a harp in his hand.
And I said to Jim...
...I said, "Jim, I don't like the way that fella's looking at us."
And Jim said he didn't care too much for it neither...
...so we both skedaddled down out of there...
...and to this day I ain't never had a good look at the Rocky Mountains.
- Well, I remember one time...
- Zebulon.
- What?
- One liar at a time is enough.
Well, then, I reckon it's about bedtime.
Gotta get an early start in the morning.
We'll be expecting you for breakfast.
Oh, well, that's mighty hospitable,
Mr. Prescott...
...but sometimes I wake up and get the urge to move.
I might be long gone by sunup, but thank you.
- I wanna thank all of you. Good night.
- Good night.
- Strange fellas, these mountain men.
- Yeah, kind of like a wisp of smoke.
- By golly, that looks like my blanket.
- It is.
Well, then, I'm a mite confused, ma'am.
Whose bed would it be?
Yours.
I ain't ever saw a bed like that since last time I come east.
Why'd you do it?
Ain't polite to ask a girl why she done something for a man.
No. Well, I reckon my manners ain't much at that.
Anyway, I sure thank you.
Good night, ma'am.
Are them Indian girls pretty?
Well, now, I reckon that all depends on just how long a man has gone...
...without seeing one.
How long's it been since you seen a white girl?
I ain't quite sure why you asked that.
How pretty do I look to you?
But, ma'am...
...ain't you just being a little bit forward?
Well, you're headed upriver and I'm headed down.
There's no time to get these questions answered.
You dead sure you want them answered?
Yes.
Glory be.
Ma'am, it seems like you've been kissed before.
I've never been kissed permanent before.
By golly, you sure use surprising words.
I never heard "permanent" mixed up with a thing like a kiss before.
I can still feel that kiss.
- Can you?
- Well, you said something before...
...that we had not forget:
I'm heading upstream and you're headed downstream.
Lovers have parted before and come together again.
- Ma'am.
- Eve.
Eve, I'm a sinful man.
Deep, dark, sinful.
I'm on my way to Pittsburgh to be sinful again.
Likely I'll stay drunk for a month.
I won't even remember the fancy gals I dally with...
...or the men I carve up just out of pure cussedness...
...any more than I'll remember you.
Linus, I'm asking you.
Can you still feel that kiss?
Eve...
Eve, you make me feel like a man standing on a narrow ledge...
...coming face-to-face with a grizzly bear.
There just ain't no ignoring the situation.
Eve!
Eve!
- Eve! Where is she?
- Zeb, what's the matter?
Anyways, you're here.
I thought you'd gone with him.
- Gone?
- Yes, gone.
I knowed you were setting with him...
...but I kept telling myself,
"At least she's looking at a man."
Even a wisp of smoke like that is better than...
Are you crying? Crying for him?
Now, what does that mean?
Now, tell me what that means.
Nothing, Pa.
What time did you come to bed?
It was early, Pa.
It wasn't. It was late.
Daughter, I'm only gonna ask you once.
Is there anything for your ma and pa to worry about?
No, Pa, there ain't.
He'll be back.
I'll see him again.
But you expected to see him this morning.
You know you did.
I don't care. I'll see him again.
Look.
- You got a growed man to do that?
- I did. Just like in the book.
Did you get him to say them crazy words?
I told you before, it ain't the words, it's the sentiment.
You mean, he didn't even giggle nor nothing at such foolishness?
He said it was a real solemn occasion.
Like shooting the rapids without a paddle.
No matter what he said, he did it just to get rid of you so as he could clear out.
You know that's so.
And you're lucky he did. Do you wanna live like a squaw all your life?
Go on, say anything you like...
...but I'll see him again. I know I will.
And he ain't got a wife and six kids.
He ain't got a wife at all yet.
Hey, Pierre!
Someone's coming upriver.
Customer.
Trapper, seems like.
See how that cover bellies up?
Could be furs.
Thirsty, mister?
Drier than a grasshopper on a hot griddle.
Well, welcome to our little inn, sir.
My name is Jeb Hawkins, late colonel of the Alabama militia.
- Where you bound for?
- Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh? Well.
Looks like he's got a whole canoe of furs, Pop.
- Sure enough mountain man.
- Indeed.
One of our explorers gonna extend our domain to the far shores of the Pacific.
Well, nothing but the finest for you, sir.
Whiskey?
- Right.
- No pepper or rattlesnake heads in this.
Nothing but the pure grain and the sweet kiss of the malt.
- Never mind the cup, I'll just take the jug.
- Oh, a real mountain man, huh?
- I trust you'll toast our noble banner, sir.
- Sure will.
Golly, you're right.
That's real sipping liquor.
Pa, him being a trapper, you suppose he might know what that varmint is we got?
Well, say, now, he might.
Yes, sir, he just might.
Sir, we caught us a cave-dwelling critter...
...that no man in these parts has seen before.
You know, it'd be right satisfying to having you tell us what it is.
Well, I don't know too much about cave-dwelling varmints.
Just yonder. Take your jug.
Well, I...
I don't know.
WOIt's right over here.
You know any sweet-talking gals in Pittsburgh?
No, no. Nary a one, yet.
Well, Pop and I are hoping we'll vacation there.
I'll be at the Duquesne House if it ain't burned down.
Hey, there, now, you pretty girl, you sure you got a varmint in here?
Now, you...
WODo you hear him?
Huh?
WOHe breathes loud and fierce.
- We keep him in this hole just yonder.
You keep him in there?
You gotta look a little closer.
Well, he seen the varmint, Pa.
- Well done, daughter.
- I ain't so sure.
He was hard muscled. I could feel the blade just skitter along his ribs.
Oh, you just need more practice, that's all.
It's a pity you ain't got the knack your ma had.
Lord rest her soul.
All right, men, lay it on, men.
Come on, come on.
We got more fish to fry.
Down to the island.
Tell Pa them settlers, rafts are coming.
Can't I have this toilet water, Pa?
- Genuine Parisian accent, it says.
- How much is it?
It's only 15 cents.
Fifteen cents? Put it back.
You're right, sir. Absolutely right.
You save the pennies and dollars will grow.
Likely you've growed many a dollar.
Mr. Bedloe, all my life I've been striving to avoid becoming a millionaire.
I think I've succeeded right well.
I've got a little put away in the sock.
It'll stay there.
Well, now, them's my sentiments exactly.
Now, you, sir.
You look like a man of property.
Now, if I was to bet, I'd say you was worth, say, a thousand dollars.
- Pretty close to the mark?
- Well, close, maybe.
Colin, how much powder we got left?
- Don't be afraid, now, don't be afraid.
Now, there's women and children here.
You gents wouldn't want us to have to start shooting, now, would you?
Be of good cheer, folks.
It's in our noble tradition that we conquer the wilderness...
...with nothing but our bare hands and stout hearts.
You can build new rafts and sally forth in the spirit of your forefathers.
Why, you pious old scoundrel.
I'll see you burn.
Americans can't be whipped.
It's him.
I knew he'd come back. It's him.
Now let us pray.
O Lord...
...we thank thee for our salvation.
We commit the souls of our dead to thy gentle keeping.
We pray for a speedy recovery of our wounded.
And now another matter.
O Lord...
...without consulting with thee...
...we have sent thy way some souls whose evil ways passeth all understanding.
We ask thee humbly to receive them.
Whether you want them or not.
Amen.
Now, it'll be a job...
...but I guess I can patch her up good enough to get to Pittsburgh.
- Linus.
- Now, Eve...
...let's just not talk any more about it.
Linus, I'm telling you, you don't know your own mind.
Well, maybe so, maybe not.
You know, I ain't saying that you haven't been on my mind some.
I ain't saying that.
But I still went to see the varmint with that pirate girl.
I'll always be going to see the varmint, Eve.
I just ain't cut out to be a farmer or a husband.
Linus, I ain't never bringing up the subject again...
...whether ever I see you or not.
No, it's for the best.
I wish you Godspeed, Eve.
And I ain't said that to anybody for a long time.
I can see rapids ahead, Pa. White water.
Look. Look.
Oh, we must've taken the wrong fork.
Let's beach her on this side.
Harvey!
Rapids!
Rapids ahead! Beach her!
Beach her!
Hold her steady.
Rein!
Pa, we're in the current!
Get inside, Zeke.
No, I don't wanna.
Straighten her, Pa.
Lilith!
Hold it steady!
I can't!
Go on. Go on to help Pa.
I'll get it.
Lilith! Lilith!
Lie down!
Lie down!
What happened?
They took the wrong fork of the river and they went over the falls.
Did you happen to hear the name of the family?
Uh... Prescott, I think.
Something like that.
As soon as they're buried decent...
...I'm heading back East on the first boat that comes along.
And if you were in your right mind, you would too.
Oh, Linus.
Would you walk with me a piece, Eve?
Eve, I...
Eve, all the time I was paddling down here
I was thinking...
...if I found you alive, I'd...
Would you come to Pittsburgh with me, Eve?
Oh, Linus.
I'm staying right here.
I ain't moving a foot one way or the other.
Now, would you explain that a little?
Ma and Pa, they wanted a farm in the West...
...and this is as far as they got.
Seems to me this is where the Lord wanted the farm to be.
But your brother, Sam, he's bad hurt, and winter's coming...
There's no sense talking about it.
I'm gonna do it.
Eve, you just ain't making much sense.
Well, half the people that come West don't make much sense, I reckon.
All right.
All right.
By golly, you're a strong-minded woman.
I reckon I seen that varmint for the last time.
The westward course was no smoother
than that of true love.
Not only the hard hand of nature
was against it, but the impediment of war.
Trouble over land
smoldered along the Mexican border.
Not all Americans were for war, including
Congressman Abe Lincoln of Illinois.
But a war did break out,
and in the end...
... vast new territories came into the Union
along with their rich Spanish names:
Rio Grande, Santa Fe,
Albuquerque, El Paso.
And most glittering of all, California...
... named after a mythical island
of pearls and gold in a 15th-century novel.
Here, in 1848...
... at Sutter's Mill, a man found something
he wasn't even looking for...
... at the bottom of a ditch.
And the cry of his discovery was heard
clear across the continent...
... in Boston, New York, Savannah...
... and across the oceans
in London, Paris, Berlin.
But nowhere was the clamor of gold
heard more eagerly than in St. Louis...
... the busiest fur-trading center
in the world...
... and the noisiest, bawdiest,
most uppity town west of New York.
I say there's no more than three.
- Six.
- Six?
It's that lace that fooled you. I say three.
Watch him. I hear Cleve's an expert on petticoats. Anyway, you can never prove it.
We're going to be late for that poker game.
Look, I've just stuck you for the most expensive dinner in St. Louis.
I don't mind sticking you a bit deeper.
I'll lay you a hundred it's no less than six.
- How will you prove it?
- Go backstage and find out.
- If I go back and check with you.
- Fair enough.
Second girl.
- Miss Prescott? Miss Prescott?
- Later.
It's rather important.
It's always important.
The older they are, the more important it gets.
Miss Prescott, please.
I am Hylan Seabury...
...attorney in the matter of Jonathan Brooks.
He means nothing to you?
That old goat?
Well, you must've meant something to him, Miss Prescott.
- Why?
- You're included in his will.
Of course, you have to make the trip to California to claim the bequest.
Well, now, I wouldn't go to California...
...if John Jacob Astor left me
San Francisco.
I don't think Mr. Astor had holdings there, no.
However, the yield from
Mr. Brooks, property is not to be scorned.
- Yield of what?
- Gold, Miss Prescott. Gold.
- Gold?
- Precisely.
You own a gold mine, Miss Prescott.
It yielded $3500 the very first week.
Gold mine?
Well. Well, I...
That sweet old goat.
For heavens...
Well.
This is an unexpected pleasure.
- Where's the money?
- Money?
Money?
Oh, yes. You're referring, of course, to our little agreement.
One hundred to start you off...
...and my share of the winnings.
Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to report that the hundred no longer exists.
That $100, I assure you...
...will turn out to be the best investment you have ever made.
I have plans, gentlemen...
...beyond your wildest dreams.
I'm gonna earn you a piece of a gold mine.
Gold mine.
You ain't gonna earn nothing.
You ain't gonna be nothing, you ain't gonna do nothing...
...unless we get that 100 back by the morning.
Grimes, you don't mean that.
- You're gonna kill off the golden goose.
- Call it what you want, mister.
We'll be waiting.
Independence, Missouri, was the jump-off
point for emigrants from everywhere.
Solid, God-fearing families
bound for the farmlands of Oregon...
... and get-rich-quick adventurers
racing for the gold of California.
Try it.
- You got a wagon, I suppose?
- I can get one.
And a team to pull it?
I can get everything I need.
- You got a husband?
- I'm single, Mr. Morgan.
No traveling companion?
- No, I'm traveling alone.
- Not on my wagon train.
Alone and single brings out the deviltry in a man.
Gets them all worked up and they're wild enough already.
I intend to keep to myself, Mr. Morgan.
Oh, woman of your sort?
One day you'd find yourself in trouble, and there'd be hell to pay just figuring out who.
What did you say, Mr. Morgan?
Well, now, ain't you the feisty one.
I like spirit in a woman.
Hey, you got a pretty face under that powder too.
And a fine, sturdy body under them clothes, I wager.
There's a woman named Clegg,
Aggie Clegg.
Why don't you go see her?
Thanks.
I told you, no.
I was hoping to make this trip with a husband.
Nearly got one last week.
Look, I hear there's 40 men to every woman in California.
- Miss Clegg, I'd be willing to pay you.
- I don't need money.
I need a man.
Any man.
Morning, ladies.
Beautiful morning.
Would you, by any chance, happen to be Miss Lily Prescott?
Not unless you got a big imagination.
Then you must be the lady in question.
Cleve Van Valen, Miss Prescott, at your service.
At your every command from here to California.
Well, thank you.
But whatever you're offering,
I don't need.
Perhaps you don't understand.
Yes, I do.
I know a tinhorn when I see one.
Miss Prescott.
I'm offering you an honest day's work for an honest day's pay.
Goodbye, Mr. Van Valen. Goodbye.
Well, it's been a pleasure to meet you,
Miss Clegg.
May I say I have never seen a woman with more beautiful hair.
What a prize catch it'll make...
...hanging from the waist of an Indian.
Beauty alone in the wilderness, and who's to protect you?
No one.
Not one person won't be looking after himself.
Well...
Good day, ladies. Good day.
Nobody ever said that to me before.
What?
That I had such... Such beautiful hair.
You know something?
I got a hunch you're gonna draw men like fish to the bait.
Maybe I can catch one of them while they swim by.
You got yourself a partner.
Thank you.
How's it, men?
It's all clear through here. Look for a little mudhole up through the next pocket.
How far?
Oh, maybe half a quarter.
Well, thanks.
Looks a little higher up on that ridge.
There's a water hole up there about half a mile. Let's head for it.
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.
Hey, you're driving.
I was raised on a farm.
Water hole about a half a mile ahead.
Hey, Aggie?
- Can you use these?
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Ladies.
At your service.
I thought we'd gotten rid of you.
Well, I just couldn't bear to think of you two making this trip without my help.
If I was to hear later on that something happened to you, I'd never forgive myself.
You came 100 miles alone?
Well, I had no way of counting the miles,
Mr. Morgan, but I'll take your word for it.
Well, you've got another 100, mister.
Going back.
I told you, when a wagon breaks down,
I want men who can fix it...
...not bet how long it'll take.
You don't mean you'll turn me out?
Pass me adrift at the mercy of savage Indians?
If you don't get moving,
I'll cast you adrift...
Uh-uh-uh.
I appeal to your sporting instinct, sir.
I'm prepared to wager you that I stay with this train.
- Well, you got a wager.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
The fact is, I hired this man.
We'll put up his stake.
Is that right, Miss Prescott?
If Miss Clegg says so.
Ma'am...
...I'll be forever grateful.
Now, I'll unpack my gear.
Agatha, have you gone crazy?
He says he's a man wanting to do an honest day's work.
And he'll do it. I can promise you that.
Hey, you men on that last wagon, keep up that slack.
Keep it up.
Get that team moving.
Keep them moving there.
Don't let those lines sag.
Keep them up. Keep them up.
Keep those teams moving.
Keep them moving.
Don't let those lines sag.
You, on that middle team, keep them moving.
Get in there.
Over here, Pa.
Get in there.
Get in there. Get in there, mule.
I'm just overwhelmed by all this attention,
Miss Prescott.
I want to confess...
...I have lied about why I wanted to work for you.
I know.
The real reason is, of course, that I'm in love with you.
No.
It's the truth.
From the first moment I saw you,
I've known that I couldn't live without you.
Well, I'd hate to be the cause of your death, Mr. Van Valen.
I don't speak lightly, Miss Prescott.
I'm prepared to assume the responsibilities of a faithful husband.
Oh, and are you ready to assume the responsibilities...
...of my property too, Mr. Van Valen?
Really?
What kind of property?
Gold, Mr. Van Valen.
Gold by the ton, from what I understand.
Bright, yellow, shiny gold.
Why, I had no idea.
- I'm sure you hadn't.
- Miss Prescott, I really mean...
Here comes Agatha.
If you must propose to somebody...
...I suggest you get on your knees to her.
Besides, she has beautiful hair.
Look at them.
Think they was getting ready to bury somebody.
Ain't we worn down enough as it is?
Well, let's wake them up.
Listen, everybody.
That's the spirit! That's the way to feel!
Oh, hiya, Mr. Morgan!
Aggie. For lunch.
Thanks. Nice nest of fish.
What is it, Mr. Morgan?
Miss Prescott, I've been thinking.
Oh?
Wet or dry, you're the handsomest woman
I ever did see.
Spirit and a fine, sturdy body.
It's a noble combination, Miss Prescott.
Why, for you, childbearing would come as easy as rolling off a log.
Well, I think I'd rather roll off a log,
Mr. Morgan.
Ma'am, I'm telling you, you got the build for it.
I want you for my wife.
I've got a cattle ranch just below the Merced.
I'll be settling down there, fit and proper.
I'm sure you're very fit and proper,
Mr. Morgan.
Well, then...
...you just couldn't do no better than marrying me.
Why, we'd have ourselves a fine family in no time at all.
I believe that.
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan...
...but I can't accept your proposal.
Why not?
Well, a woman likes to hear something a little more inviting.
Well, ain't that what I've been doing?
Inviting you?
Inviting you to share my life,
Miss Prescott.
I'm sorry, Mr. Morgan.
It's something else, ain't it?
Must be something else nagging at you.
Well...
...I don't aim to let it stop me,
Miss Prescott.
You can count on that.
What did he want?
Children.
Children?
Well, I'll be...
Why didn't he come shopping at the right store?
- I'll take a look.
- Well.
Now, gentlemen, are we pikers?
I'm gonna see and I'm gonna raise this fine pistol...
...London-made and loaded for bear.
I'll take part of that bet.
I told you I wouldn't stand for you fleecing any...
Cheyennes.
There's too many to fight.
We'll have to run for it.
You can't outrun them with wagons.
The minute you get moving, cut your teams loose.
- Have you gone crazy?
- Go on, get moving.
Chances are they want our stock more than us.
Now, you're a gambler, ain't you?
All right, let's get moving.
Keep them closed up there.
I don't know how to unhook them.
Cleve, watch out!
Cleve!
Joe, pick me up.
We'll be moving at daybreak.
I'll take a few men, see if we can find him.
Give him a decent, Christian burial.
Someone's coming! Someone's coming!
Well, I can let you have this rig for a dollar a day, and I'll give you a good team.
- Pick it up in the morning.
- That'll be fine.
Could you tell me the way to the Brooks claim?
Well, the claims are down by the river.
- Which road should I take?
- Only one road. Along the river.
- Thank you.
- Sure welcome.
We're looking for a Mr. Huggins.
You found him.
This is Miss Lilith Prescott.
I figured.
They told me you was a real looker.
Yup. It's all here for you.
Just the way Mr. Brooks staked it out.
Must've had 20 men working on it.
Well, where are they now?
Who's digging the gold?
Gold? I ain't never seen a better grade since I come here with Millie.
It was just a pocket, though.
The whole shebang, nothing but a pocket.
Oh, we cleared 4200 before it played out.
Now, about that 4200...
Mr. Brooks, he spent three before his heart give out.
I put up 600 for a brass-handled casket.
I figure the rest you owe me for sitting on your claim.
Oh, miss, I mean, that's only fair, ain't it?
I mean, wouldn't you...?
Funny pair, all right.
How about you boys?
Come and see the brand-new attraction.
It's exciting and sensational.
Step right in, gentlemen.
Miss Prescott?
Hello, Mr. Morgan.
I'd invite you in, but it's a little cramped.
This is no life for a fine woman like you.
I heard your mine was played out.
But where's your fancy friend?
Cleve?
Last I heard, he was in Hangtown.
You mean that no-good went off and left you?
He went off and left me.
But I don't agree that he's no good.
Cleve is Cleve, that's all.
You're a perplexing woman,
Miss Prescott.
When a skunk needs killing...
...well, it ain't enough just to say a skunk's a skunk.
Mr. Morgan...
...all my life I've wanted to marry a rich husband.
Can I blame Cleve for wanting to marry a rich wife?
Both of us may have been born for the poorhouse...
...but we're not the kind to like it.
Do you believe all this you've been saying, or is it just words?
Now, tell me the truth.
The truth is...
...Cleve and I couldn't live alone just on love.
Not for five minutes.
Then you've answered the question I've been asking for better than 2000 miles.
I got the biggest ranch you ever did see.
You can't ride across it in a day.
That land's gonna mean money sooner than you think.
You want a rich husband...
...you're looking at him.
There ain't a blessed thing you have to do except mind the kids.
I'm sorry.
Not now.
Not ever.
What a waste.
Someone put together like you.
Aggie.
Those who struck it rich wanted
all the pleasures that money could buy.
And there were plenty to sell to them.
Even the Sacramento riverboats
took on luxury goods.
I'll see it.
It's up to you.
Betting?
What's the matter with you?
- I'm checking out.
- Checking out?
What's the matter with him?
Lily, I got to talk to you.
I found myself throwing in a winning hand.
Well, I just never thought
I'd do that for any girl.
Lily.
How'd you like to hook up with a no-good gambler?
Oh, hon, we are on our way.
I got $1200 right here.
- What'll we do, open a gambling house?
- No.
A married man should spend his evenings at home.
Then we'll open a music hall in San Francisco.
- No.
- I can still sing and dance.
No. A married woman should spend her evenings at home.
- But we can't sit at home on $1200 for...
- Lily.
Have you seen San Francisco?
It's ugly, and it's small, and it's full of fleas.
And it burns down about every five minutes...
...but each time they keep on rebuilding it a little bigger and better than before.
It's alive and kicking and nothing can stop it.
And it makes you wanna build something too.
A railroad.
A steamship line.
Something to help the baby grow.
Cleve, on $1200?
We could start out with a wagon or a rowboat.
With the help of the devil,
I'll bet we make it.
Young America was not only
a union of East and West.
There were North and South too.
And between them,
the bonds were weakening.
Mr. Lincoln, now retired
from Congress and practicing law...
... realized that the South would fight...
... to mold the new and
uncommitted territories to its own image.
Still two years from the presidency...
... he pleaded that the free West
be allowed to remain free...
... and warned of the hazards
of a house divided against itself.
But the South,
seeing its power and influence wane...
... struggled against the inevitable
in dozens of Western towns.
And slowly, the bitter seeds of civil war
took root.
Howdy, Ms. Rawlings.
Whoa, Rosebud, whoa.
Say, Mr. Peterson, what's that suit you got on?
Uniform, Mrs. Rawlings. A uniform.
Our militia company was sworn in...
...and I'm Corporal Peterson now,
Ohio Volunteers.
You won't be seeing me for a spell.
Hey, I got a letter for you, from way out in California.
It must be from my sister, Lilith.
"Dear Eve..."
Mr. Peterson, could you wait a minute?
I wanna answer this right away.
Zeb?
Zeb, come on down here.
Well, we was hoping that Zeb might be going with us.
His pa went when the first bugle blew.
Ain't one enough?
Hi, corporal.
Jeremiah, get Mr. Peterson some buttermilk.
Buttermilk.
It's from your aunt Lilith.
She says there ain't no war out in California and they don't expect there'll be one.
"Business is brisk.
Many opportunities for an energetic young man."
There's talk of building a railroad east.
"Cleve has hopes of getting in on the ground floor.
We would welcome Zeb if he wants to come."
Ma, did you write her about me?
- Not exactly.
- Now, did you?
I told her you didn't like farming any better than your pa did.
Ma, you got the wrong idea about this war.
It ain't gonna be so bad, is it, corporal?
You know Pa's having the time of his life.
Now, Ms. Rawlings,
I got it from the captain himself...
...that we ain't gonna be gone no time at all.
Pa left it up to you whether I go or not.
But you know what he really felt.
Ms. Rawlings, there ain't much glory in tromping behind a plow.
Reckon there's no hurry in answering this letter.
Thank you for waiting.
You mean I can go?
Oh, there'll be things to do.
Ma...
Gotta get your underwear washed and your socks darned.
Do they give you one of them suits?
One of them uniforms?
I reckon.
Might not give you no shirts, though.
Take that one off, I'll wash it for you.
I got the others washed, they aren't ironed yet.
Mother, I...
Why'd you call me that?
It's always been "Ma" before.
I don't know.
All of a sudden...
..."Ma" didn't seem enough somehow.
Hey, cowpoke!
Go on back, dog!
Go on!
What could I do, Pa?
He's Linus, boy.
Always was more Linus, blood.
I guess that's why I love him so much.
But you've gotta help me pray, Pa.
Help me pray.
Ohio.
Battery B, Ohio!
- Let's go!
On the double, come on!
Anybody here from the 12th Michigan?
Thirty-sixth Indiana.
Evening of April 6th, 1862.
The guns that had roared all day
fell silent...
... around a little church
called the Shiloh Meeting House.
Many a man had met his God
that Sunday...
... but not in church.
You wasted your time, men. He's dead.
- But, doc, this here is Captain Rawlings.
- Captain Linus Rawlings.
- Take him out.
- Keep moving, men.
- Why can't you look where you're going?
- I'm sorry, soldier.
Watch it.
Saw. Brandy.
Chloroform.
Get it all down. Come on, all of it.
Come on, we're just in the way here.
It had been the bloodiest day
of the war on the Western front.
In the morning, it had looked like
a Confederate victory, but by nightfall...
... no man cared to use
the words "win" or "lose."
After Shiloh...
... the South never smiled.
- You tasted that water yet?
- No.
Well, try it.
- Tastes funny, huh?
- Yeah.
I seen it before sundown. It was pink.
Pinker than sassafras tea.
You mean...?
It don't seem fitting a man should have to drink water like that.
Don't seem fitting a man should have to do any of the things we've done today.
Did you kill anybody?
I don't think so.
I got knocked dizzy right off.
And when I come to, found my rifle, it was busted.
And then some more soldiers come along and tried to stick me in the arm.
All the rest is mixed up after that.
Well, I ain't killed nobody, neither.
And I don't want to.
- Hey, where you from?
- Ohio.
This fool war started in the East.
What's us Westerners doing in it?
I don't rightly know anymore.
It ain't quite what I expected.
There ain't much glory looking at a man with his guts hanging out.
- Where are you from?
- Texas.
Say...
You ain't a Reb, are you?
Well, I was this morning.
Tonight, I ain't so sure.
Seems like I ought to be shooting you.
Well, you got anything to shoot with?
No.
All I got's this bayonet.
I got a pistol.
I took it off a dead officer.
Hey, why don't we skedaddle out of here?
- You mean desert?
- I mean, why don't...?
Just leave this here war to the folks who'd want it.
They say there ain't no war out in California.
Get that battery over here.
Stragglers, join your regiment.
Stragglers. Hey, you!
I'm planning to move Rousseau's brigade into this area.
Hidden battery, placed well before dawn.
Do you approve?
I'll approve any dispositions you wanna make.
If you hadn't held the flank today, we'd have been whipped for fair.
Sherman, let's sit down a minute.
There's something I wanna say to you.
Lantern.
You may find yourself in command here.
Why?
I've seen some of the dispatches the newspaper correspondents have filed today.
They're saying
I was taken by surprise this morning.
You weren't taken by surprise.
I was.
No matter.
They're saying...
...I was drunk again last night.
Were you?
No.
But you can't fight front and rear.
Win or lose, tomorrow...
...I intend to resign.
Because of the newspapers?
Because of a general lack of confidence in me.
Oh, don't you think
I've ever felt like that?
A month ago they were saying
I was crazy. Insane.
Now they're calling me a hero.
A hero or crazy, I'm the same man.
It doesn't matter what the people think.
It's what you think, Grant.
You mean that's Grant?
I reckon.
General Grant.
You know this war's gonna be won in the West, and how to win it.
Everything you've done proves it.
And I say that a man has the right to resign only if he's wrong.
Not if he's right.
I guess I never thought of it that way.
I'll think it over.
What is there to think about?
The Army's better off with you than without you. That's the test.
All right.
Thanks.
There's a lot to do before morning, Sherman.
What are you doing?
Why did you make me do that?
Fire.
Hey, Zeb!
Didn't you get my letter?
I wrote more than four months ago.
She never was...
...quite the same after she got the news about Pa.
I don't think she minded going,
Zeb, except...
...she wanted to see you again.
Of course Pa ain't really there.
I put up a stone anyway.
Well...
...better be on my way.
Way? Where?
I need you, Zeb.
Only one thing brought me back.
She's...
Well, this farm is half yours.
I was thinking we'd finally clear away that patch of woods down by the river and...
You're twice the farmer I am.
You don't need me.
Farm's all yours. It's only fair.
Sure don't feel right about this.
What are you gonna do?
I haven't mustered out yet.
I can still transfer to the regulars.
Cavalry, maybe. Go west.
Have to fight Indians?
You sure are hard to make out, Zeb.
Now, what do you wanna do that for?
Do you like fighting?
You remember the story Pa used to tell us about fighting that grizzly bear?
Yeah.
And I asked him, I said,
"Well, why'd you get in such a fix?
Do you like fighting grizzlies?"
He said:
"Well, uh, not especially. Uh...
I just wanted to go somewhere and the bear was there first."
Well, I...
I guess I just wanna go somewhere too.
- So long.
- So long, Zeb.
Even while North and South
were being torn apart...
... East and West had been
drawn together by the Pony Express...
... the most daring mail route in history.
Eighty riders were in the saddle
at all times, night and day, in all weather.
Half of them riding east,
half riding west...
... between Missouri and Sacramento...
... carrying mail across country
in days instead of months.
Unarmed, they rode to save weight.
Five dollars a letter, the mail cost,
and on thin paper too.
It was courage, skill and speed...
... against hostile Indians, bandits,
hell and occasional high water.
Even as they rode,
men were already building...
... a faster message carrier across
the country: The Overland Telegraph.
And the Indians found
a new amusement...
... listening to the level tune
of the singing wires.
But far less amusing to the Indians...
... was the coming of the steel roadway
of the iron horse.
The surveyors, route lay through immense
natural barriers, the Rocky Mountains...
... and the equally discouraging
High Sierras.
But range upon range could never stop
the titanic contest...
... between two corporate giants
racing to put down...
... the greatest mileage of track
before they met.
The Central Pacific eastward
from Sacramento through the Sierras.
And the Union Pacific,
forging westward across the plains...
... with the Rockies still to come.
The prize in the race was free land,
vast parcels for every mile of track laid.
Land that would one day
be worth millions.
Hold it.
Set it down.
Workers, up.
Where'd you find them?
About a mile back yonder.
That's Johnny Hormatz.
That's Jack Perkin.
What the hell is this? A picnic?
- Well, the Indians got a couple of our men...
- Mister, you were the foreman here.
Now you're a tracklayer.
Now get back to work, all of you!
Move it!
Fast!
- You.
- Yes, sir.
You're the foreman till I can find somebody better.
- Yes, sir.
- Get them at it.
- Wait a minute.
- Move it!
Your name Jethro Stuart?
All right, get at it.
Well, Mr. Jethro Stuart, you're hired to hunt buffalo to feed these men...
...not to stop their work.
Why'd you bring these bodies here?
They're railroaders. I thought somebody in the railroad might be interested.
I'm the railroad and I'm not interested.
You should've buried them, then tracked down the Indians who did it.
Well, Mr. King, like you said,
I was hired to hunt...
...not to dig graves or fight Indians.
Those fellas are mostly old soldiers.
You wouldn't think a couple dead men bother them much.
I don't want anything in their thick skulls but their work. Do you understand?
Now, get rid of those bodies.
Start tracking those Indians.
You keep forgetting, Mr. King, my job's buffalo.
It was buffalo.
Go to the paymaster and draw your time.
Well, now, that foreman fella, you didn't fire him.
You just took him down a peg because you needed him.
Who's gonna shoot buffalo? You?
- What the devil is that?
- Milk.
Milk?
The Army must've changed since I was in it.
- Just rode in. I'm hungry.
- You are, huh?
But you'd rather watch them than eat.
- Is that it?
- That's it.
Well, I wish you were as eager to protect this railroad.
Did you get any word about those two men who were killed today?
I tracked the Arapahos and talked to the chief.
Those men were a mile off the right-of-way...
...where they had no business, drunk and chasing squaws.
- As much their fault as it was the Indians'.
- That a fact?
Well, soldier boy, your job is to fight Indians, not to agree with them.
Mr. King, there were 200 Arapahos and I had 20 men.
Now, to me...
...agreeing seemed wiser than fighting.
To you, huh?
Well, you know, I might just send off a wire to the colonel.
He may not agree.
I already reported. He does agree.
Acknowledged and understood. Sergeant.
Trouble, sir?
I don't know.
Hey, lieutenant.
I got a message:
Indians are up to something.
You know anything about it?
Chief says railroad busted the agreement.
Changed the route, come smack through Arapaho hunting grounds.
- You sure the chief's right?
- Plenty sure.
They're getting the war paint ready.
Can you stand there and tell me...
...that one little change is gonna cost the Arapahos one buffalo.
- Or even one jackrabbit?
- Mr. King.
They can be made to see it differently.
Who's hurting them?
What's a railroad anyway?
Two tracks and a whistle.
It's not the tracks they're afraid of.
It's what the tracks bring.
The buffalo hunters slaughtering off their herds.
And then the settlers coming in.
And when will that be?
Twenty, 30 years, maybe?
By then, we'll all be dead.
Right now we're just crossing the land.
That's all. Land that's safe to the Arapahos for our lifetime.
Now, you go talk to them.
Smoke a peace pipe with them.
Do anything they want.
Just get them to make a new agreement.
That's your job, isn't it?
Keeping the peace?
I'll keep the peace, Mr. King...
...but you keep your promise.
Hear your name's Rawlings, you're from Ohio.
Your pa's name couldn't be
Linus Rawlings, could it?
- Could be.
- Knew him.
Jethro Stuart.
- He used to speak of you.
- Used to?
Pa was killed at Shiloh.
Sit down, Mr. Stuart.
Well, better than dying behind a plow.
I tried it. Settled down for a year once.
Took 10 years off my life.
Your ma...
She must've been something real special getting old Linus to stay put.
She was, Mr. Stuart. Very special.
Old Linus.
Two years running once.
Your pa and me trapped together.
Up along the Waunakee.
Got so many beaver, we had to tie them tail-to-tail...
...just to drag them down the mountain.
Over a mile long it was, that line of beaver pelts.
Mr. Stuart, my father could take the truth and stretch it about six ways.
You sound just like him.
I'll take it you meant that kindly.
Well, I'd think twice before I called you a liar.
Tell me something, talking about liars.
Why would a son of old Linus get mixed up with a man like Mike King?
I know what you mean.
- But Mike King isn't the railroad.
- Oh?
I don't think he knows that.
He's changing the route back, is he?
No.
I know.
But he'd do anything to gain a day on the Central Pacific.
He's not a fool. He doesn't want a war, and neither do the Arapahos.
I think I could get them to agree to this change in route...
...if I sit down and talk with them for a while.
- How you gonna get them to do it?
- That's just it.
I need somebody that knows the language and who they trust.
You wouldn't happen to know someone like that, would you, Mr. Stuart?
Your pa could set a trap like no man I ever come across.
Just coax them on and, bam.
You'd better do something so he'll know you're pledging your word.
That blame whistle's like the crack of doom for all that's natural.
My ma felt a man ought to make his scratch on the land.
Leave it a little different than when he come.
Anyway, thanks for fixing things with the chief.
Me? I fixed nothing.
You put the words to my mouth but that won't make them come true.
Jethro, I said what I had to to keep the peace.
- I know there's a risk.
- Risk?
Maybe you don't understand.
You pledged your word back there.
Not mine, not the Army's, not the railroad's.
It's your word told them they'd keep their hunting grounds.
- I think they will.
- I think you got your neck stuck out...
...like a prairie chicken waiting for one side or the other to chop it off.
Your pa and me got kicked out of one territory after another...
...with people pouring in, killing off game, putting up towns.
It ain't gonna stop.
Your treaty's gonna get broke and
I don't wanna be around to see it happen.
Look me up when you get your bellyful.
- Where you going?
- Heading back to the mountains.
A high lonesome where there ain't no people at all yet.
So long.
By now, the Central Pacific had broken
through the wall of the high Sierras...
... and was straining eastward
across the flatlands of Nevada.
While the Union Pacific,
thanks to its long peace with the Indians...
... was able to keep up pressure
just as avidly in the opposite direction.
The competition was exciting,
but also costly...
... and both companies were itching
to earn money from tracks already laid.
Did the horses ride all right, Jake?
- No better than I did.
We'll have to rest them a day before we can start hunting rabbits, much less buffalo.
Just get them to water right away.
You say no buffalo hunter come.
White man, liar.
We scout for you no more.
Not in our lifetime, you said.
And there they are.
The buffalo slaughterers and the settlers.
All right, it's sooner than I figured.
But the railroad's broke.
They need money to keep moving on.
No people, no money.
No money, no railroad.
- It's as simple as that.
- What about the Arapahos?
Just take a look at those people.
Half of them straight from Europe.
They'll have a rough time, but they'll make it.
And do you wanna know why they'll make it?
Because they're willing to change their ways.
Arapahos will have to change too.
If they don't, they're finished.
I know they have to and someday the land will be taken over...
...by these farmers with their towns and their cattle.
But not like this.
They don't have to be double-crossed, and I don't have to be a part of it.
You don't, lieutenant?
Well, aren't you forgetting that uniform?
That's right, Mr. King, I'm forgetting it.
If the Army hasn't got any authority out here, I'm resigning. And now.
I don't see how that's gonna help the Arapahos.
Nothing will help them.
But nothing's gonna stop them.
Indian attack!
Indian attack! Take cover!
Take a good look.
You wanted a war and you got one.
I hope you're the first man killed in it.
Turn those wagons over!
Shoot for the lead horses.
Pick off the chief.
Rawlings, try that.
The Indians are stampeding the buffalo.
Dirty skunks. Come on.
I told you there'd be no war.
Look at them.
They've quit.
They'll be back.
They just sent a bunch of animals to kill an animal they call the "iron horse."
Well, it's still standing, isn't it?
And nothing's gonna stop it.
You think you can live with that?
I can live with it, or I can die with it.
Just listen.
You can live with that?
That?
That ain't crying.
That's just new life going on.
Pick up this woman and put the rest of the injured in the tent house.
Hey, Merv...
The rest of you, back to work.
We got a railroad to build.
Well...
Looks like you finally got your bellyful.
Hello, Jethro.
Appears you're doing well.
Can't complain.
Creek's loaded with beavers, fighting their way into the trap.
No white men looking over my shoulder...
...and the Indians are plumb cordial.
Toss your stuff in there.
Plenty of room for two.
Thanks.
You'll be bunking yonder.
Take your bearings now so you can find it when you need it.
If you don't like my snoring, you can build your own cabin.
I'll furnish the ax.
- Thanks. I'm just passing through.
- Through to where?
Anywhere you go is like where you've been.
Ain't you lost enough tail feathers back there?
I've been plucked some.
But that's what I like about this country.
There's always greener grass over the next hill.
Not no more.
Not since that damn railroad come.
All the grass is being staked out now, with a lock on it.
Maybe I'll just have to climb a little higher hill to find it.
How about coming along?
You crazy?
Like the Indians say, "These rocks and trees around here feel no call to move."
Why should I?
Guess I'm not an Indian, Jethro.
But I'm sure not a rock nor a tree.
Man belongs his own kind, like him or not.
The coming of railroads brought changes
in the land through which they passed.
Now immense herds of cattle were driven
hundreds of miles to meet the lines...
... bound for markets in the East.
Fences went up, cattle trails were barred...
... and a long and bloody wrangle began
between cattlemen and homesteaders.
The law was in the hands of whoever
could shoot fast and straight...
... except where there was somebody
determined to stand for law.
Others might look on sheep and a shepherd
as a pastoral scene.
Not the cattleman.
To him, sheep destroyed grass,
and grass came dear.
And if a man's life were held cheaper
than grass...
... it was considered a casualty of war,
not a crime.
And, in all this, the man with the star
was only one against many.
But time was running out
for the reckless ones...
... the desperadoes,
the gallop-and-gunshot boys...
... as more and more citizens demanded
respect for the law...
... and showed themselves ready to fight
to uphold it.
And the raw new towns that sprung up
in the West began to dream...
... of becoming as refined as that one-time
hooligan city by the Golden Gate.
San Francisco was now respectable.
So sophisticated, in fact,
it even had mansions up for auction.
Two thousand dollars.
Two thousand dollars.
Is that your last bid?
Ladies and gentlemen, this trophy is solid gold and fully inscribed.
"Mr. Cleve Van Valen, president.
San Francisco-Kansas City Railroad."
It's a treasure he held dear to his heart.
Do I hear $3000 for this priceless possession?
Priceless, my foot.
We used it for a doorstop.
- Twenty-five hundred.
- Twenty-five hundred dollars.
Twenty-five hundred dollars.
Twenty-five hundred? Sold $2500.
It's a sad day, Lilith.
Sad?
We made and spent three fortunes together.
What's so sad about that?
And if he'd lived a little longer, we would've made and spent another.
- I beg your pardon, Mrs. Van Valen.
- What?
The chair, it's been sold. I'm sorry.
Well then, take it.
Quit apologizing and take it.
Thank you, madam.
If there'd been some other way to pay off the debts...
It doesn't matter.
I've got two things no one can ever take from me:
This and my land in Arizona.
Lilith, I don't want to dash any hopes...
...but that ranch is nearly worthless.
Well, it's there, isn't it?
Yes, but most of the cattle have been sold off or stolen.
- I'll get cattle.
- You'll need someone to work it.
- Someone to manage it for you.
- I'll get that too.
Who?
My nephew.
He's a marshal out there somewhere.
Now, Lilith, at your age, it might be kind of rough.
Rough?
My ma and pa were killed going down the river just looking for land.
I guess I got a little of that Prescott blood in me after all.
Pa?
Is Aunt Lilith's house on Nob Hill as high as that?
I don't know, son.
On our way home, you ask your aunt Lilith.
She'll tell you.
Honey? Do you think you'll know her?
- What?
- You aunt Lilith.
- Do you think you'll recognize her?
- Sure.
Zeb? What's the matter?
Nothing.
Come on.
Thank you.
- Ma'am, are you our great-aunt Lilith?
- If you're Zeb's children, I am.
- Lilith.
- Zeb.
Zeb Rawlings.
Oh, goodness.
I swore up and down I wasn't gonna cry.
You're just as pretty as Ma said you was.
I'd like you to meet my wife, Julie.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm pleased to meet you too.
I just can't tell you how pleased.
This here's Eve, underneath all the jam.
- Come on and meet Sam now.
- Sam?
Sam's our horse.
He could pull two wagons if he wanted.
Oh, well, if you'll excuse me,
I have my orders to meet Sam.
Come on.
- Oh, just a minute now, boys.
- But he's on the other side.
Come on.
Okay.
Come on.
Just a minute.
I think this means a whole lot to her.
You have no idea how much it means to me...
...to be able to settle down to a life of peace and quiet.
I'll get the luggage.
Hello, boys.
Jake.
Tom.
Pablo.
Zeb. Let's go.
Now, marshal, don't tell me you come all the way to Gold City just to meet me?
I hardly expected it.
And the beautiful... Mrs. Rawlings?
What a pleasure.
I envy you, marshal.
A well-favored, bright-eyed wife...
...just as dazzling as that sun up there.
Makes you almost thankful, don't it?
It makes a person wanna live.
That's Charlie Gant.
I thought you said he was in Montana.
Zeb?
I'm just gonna get the luggage, that's all.
See to the rooms, will you, Julie?
- Prescott, take care of the horses.
- Yes, sir.
- Linus, help your mother.
- Yes, sir.
Anything wrong, Julie?
No. No, nothing.
Come on, Eve.
- Lou.
- Zeb.
Got a minute?
Of course I got a minute.
Here.
Now, I urge you, most respectfully to peruse the...
- Cigar?
- No, thanks.
Well, what can I do for you?
Go ahead, name it.
I saw Gant get off the train this morning.
There were three men waiting for him.
That's why you're here, huh?
That's it.
Look, there ain't a thing we can do...
...to keep Charlie Gant from going where he wants to in this territory.
I know. I know what he was...
...but that's over now.
It was over the day his brother got...
Should've killed them both that day, but...
Well, you didn't.
There ain't a thing I can do about it now.
What's he doing here, Lou?
Ain't you even curious?
Well, what do you want me to do?
Run him out of town at the point of a gun?
Do you think we still put the law inside a holster here?
Look over there, Zeb. There's the law.
With all its writs and decrees and...
- We abide by that circuit judge now.
- How many get killed meantime?
Nobody's got killed. Nobody's going to.
Doc Holliday, the Clantons, the Youngers...
- They're all gone now.
- Charlie Gant ain't gone.
You get me a warrant. I'll get you Gant.
Lou? They want three guards in the wagon with the gold shipment tomorrow.
- Three?
- This is a big one. Over $100,000 worth.
I'll take Clayton and Sims with me, all right?
Well?
Well what?
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- It means we put on a three-man guard.
- To the train.
What happens then?
You know there's gold going out here every month or so.
There hasn't been a train robbery since Jesse James was killed.
Now, if the councilors wish to have a conference, we'll have one.
Zeb.
I don't want any trouble here now.
We've been friends a long time.
As a friend...
...I'd like you to leave town.
Boys, get back from there.
Look down there, son.
- Do you know how deep that shaft is?
- Uh-uh.
That's a thousand foot deep.
Do you know how deep a thousand foot is?
Uh-uh.
Well, if you had 200 brothers, all standing on your shoulders...
...you wouldn't be able to see over the top.
- I'd be squished.
Come on.
I'll show you boys the donkey engine.
You boys go ahead.
I'll be along in a minute.
I hear you've been talking to the local marshal about me.
- Would you call that friendly?
- I never considered us exactly friendly.
I don't like you, marshal.
I don't like what you and your kind are doing to this country.
Now, I don't want any trouble.
But you wanna put things on the old basis, just you and me?
That's fine.
I'm not gonna get in a fight with you, Gant.
It's peace you want, huh, marshal?
Peace?
There's only one kind I know of.
That's the kind my brother's got.
What happened to your brother didn't teach you very much, did it?
Easy, marshal.
Floyd never made mistakes...
...except the one time he trusted you.
And you're the one that got away.
One of these days, I'm likely to pay you Rawlingses a little visit.
Come on, move along.
Get those gold boxes up there.
That's a lot of gold.
Come on, keep moving, boys.
Zeb?
Lou Ramsey's here.
Lou.
- I warned you, Zeb.
- What is it?
Gant came to see me last night.
Said you tried to start some trouble with him.
You believe him?
I'm telling you, Zeb, you take your trouble to your own territory.
I don't want any more of it here.
There won't be any more trouble, Lou.
Gant's gone.
Rode out of here early this morning.
With who?
His gang.
They should be somewhere between here and Kingman...
...waiting on that train.
You don't fool me for a minute, Zeb.
You are not looking for a robbery, you're looking for Gant.
You still carry lead where he shot you.
That was Texas.
And Oklahoma, where you killed Floyd.
And now this.
I'm sorry, Julie...
...but I don't want my office to be any part of this.
Zeb?
The boys have got the team hitched.
I know.
It's almost time to go.
Zeb?
- Julie.
- No one's asking you to face Gant.
No one's making you.
We could ride out of here right now.
We could forget it.
Maybe there's something you haven't told me.
Is there, Zeb?
I'm asking you not to go.
Please.
Don't go.
Sorry, Julie.
I guess there's nothing more pigheaded in a man than his sense of honor.
They're all the same, every one of them.
You take my Cleve now.
Never could turn down a poker game.
Felt duty-bound to go.
Three nights running sometimes, but he wouldn't quit...
...not if his life depended on it. He...
I guess it isn't very funny.
Ma?
Where's Pa?
Out. That's where he is.
- What's the matter with Mom?
Nothing's the matter.
Come on, now, in the other room.
- What's the matter?
Come on, we're gonna play.
That's a good girl. That's better.
What's the matter with Mama?
- Nothing's the matter.
Do you know any games?
We know tag.
Musical chairs.
- Ugh. Tag.
- I know hide-and-seek.
Well, do you know how to play poker?
- Poker?
- Poker?
You're in luck. Sit down right there.
Now, come on, sit down. That's it.
But we don't know how to play poker.
Well, it's time you learned.
First, we'll start off with a little five-card stud.
I'll take that rifle, Zeb.
Your pistol too.
Sorry, Lou.
I just can't oblige.
Thought the law wouldn't let you use that anymore.
I'll use it if I have to.
I'm going out of here, Lou, and I'm taking this with me.
To kill Gant.
That's what you think, isn't it?
It's something personal between him and me.
Well, Lou, it could be...
...if I settle down with my family and wait for him to come.
And he'll come if I don't stop him here and now.
I'm gonna catch Gant red-handed, breaking the law...
...and then I'm gonna use the law to put him away once and for all.
The law, Lou.
I'm gonna use the law...
...but I haven't got much chance without your help.
How many men in the caboose?
Just one brakeman.
- Is he armed?
- No, never has been.
I'll be in the express car.
Thanks, Lou.
Marshal?
There's some riders up ahead.
I'll take a look.
Engineer, there's a barricade ahead!
Open it up, wide open.
Zeb!
Come on. Come on.
Everyone make it?
- Frenchy's horse fell.
- I don't think he made it.
- Well, let's move.
It's a long way from here to that gold.
There's no danger. Just keep going.
It's Rawlings.
Back this train up!
And fast!
How come we're leaving so early, Pa?
We got a long way to go, son.
Here.
Auntie, when we going to your house?
Your daddy will decide when we get to your home.
Auntie, can we take Sam with us?
I think Sam is taking us.
Pa, how much further is it to Aunt Lilith's ranch?
Well, son, it's around the next bend, the next bend...
...and the valley beyond.
- Oh.
- Aunt Lilith, do you know that song?
LINUS: That's our song.
Your song?
I sang that song long before your pa was ever born.
Come on.
Zeb.
The West that was won by its pioneers,
settlers, adventurers is long gone now.
Yet it is theirs forever.
For they left tracks in history
that will never be eroded by wind or rain...
... never plowed under by tractors,
never buried in the compost of events.
Out of the hard simplicity of their lives,
out of their vitality...
... their hopes and their sorrows...
... grew legends of courage and pride...
... to inspire their children
and their children's children.
From soil enriched by their blood...
... out of their fever to explore and build...
... came lakes where once
were burning deserts...
... came the goods of the earth,
mines and wheat fields...
... orchards and great lumber mills...
... all the sinews of a growing country.
Out of their rude settlements,
their trading posts, came cities...
... to rank among the great ones
of the world.
All the heritage of a people
free to dream...
... free to act,
free to mold their own destiny.
I need some horseshoe nails.
Well, I have all sizes.
Some new and some old. Select.
How much are they?
12 centavos.
I'm looking for a man named O'Malley.
Fellow about your height, wears black pants and shirt, black boots.
Carries a derringer.
He always wears a loud-colored scarf around his neck.
Has a hole in his chin.
Here.
It's worth 50 pesos if anybody's seen him.
They are desolate they cannot help you.
But, 50 pesos, señor?
This man must be a very dear friend, no?
No.
Jack-boy!
You be quiet.
Good evening.
Good evening.
The name's O'Malley.
How do you do, Mr. O'Malley?
I'm Mrs. John Breckenridge.
My husband's gone to
Calvillo on business.
Sorry to hear that.
I was hoping to ask him for a night's hospitality.
Mr. Breckenridge has always welcomed strangers to the plateau.
I'm grateful to
Mr. Breckenridge.
Won't anybody take care of the gentleman's horse?
Mr. O'Malley, this is Milton Wing,
Mr. Breckenridge's ranch manager.
Howdy.
This horse's been lathered up some.
Well, I'd say that's because he was run some, wouldn't you?
Guess so.
This is Jose. Rosario.
My daughter.
Oh.
She favors you.
You're a lucky young lady.
This is Melissa Linda
Anthony Breckenridge.
We call her Melissa.
Well, how do you do,
Melissa?
Oh.
Thank you.
Well, I'd be most grateful to Mr. Breckenridge for my supper.
Are you a cowboy,
Mr. O'Malley?
What have I done to give you that idea?
You don't dress like one, so I just wondered.
No, I don't like cows much.
And the only way
I really like a horse is when he's hitched to a nice two-seater buggy with good springs.
I ran into a cowboy this morning up at the pass.
Seemed to be looking for somebody.
Tall man?
Sure was.
I never really met an American cowboy.
You'd be disappointed.
Was he riding a blue roan?
That's right.
What makes you think
I'd be disappointed?
Well, you see, cowboys aren't very bright.
They're always broke and generally they're drunk.
Did he carry his gun on the left?
Yep... 45 on the left.
You may get the chance to meet one in the flesh real soon.
You know this fellow?
I know of him.
We've never met, but we will.
Mrs. Breckenridge, will you do me the honor of dancing?
No.
I dance vary rarely,
Mr. O'Malley. And then only with my husband.
He's to be envied.
Then dance with me,
Mr. O'Malley.
I love to dance.
I'd be delighted.
Do you want to try it again?
Sure...
It's time for bed, Melissa.
Oh, no, not yet.
Yes. Gracias, muchachos.
Are you going to sleep in the house,
Mr. O'Malley?
You know Mr. Breckenridge has a special room in the toolhouse for guests.
Oh, well. Good night.
Good night.
I'll show him.
Never mind,
I'll show him myself.
Here's your lamp.
Your bed's up there.
Why did you have to come back?
I ran into somebody who told me your married name and where you were.
I started riding that same day.
You're lying.
You came here to hide.
There's someone on my trail, sure. There always is.
But I haven't been running away from him,
I've just been coming to you.
And now I'm here.
And I'm not hiding.
And I'm going to stay.
No, Bren.
You're leaving tomorrow and you're not coming back.
Belle.
I can't leave you now.
I never did leave you, really.
All these years
I've remembered you as you were that night.
A pretty girl coming down the steps in a yellow dress.
And another boy asked me to dance.
You began that awful whistle and just watched for a minute.
Then you tore my flowers off and knocked him down.
I know, but that's all in the past.
That part of me is over.
It took three men to stop you.
You were killing him.
I'm trying to tell you that I've changed.
I'm completely different now.
You'll see.
You still got that yellow dress?
I burned it.
I'll get you another one.
Oh, Belle. Belle...
Belle, remember that night?
The music floating down from your uncle's house, me sitting by my campfire, thinking of you dancing in the arms of other men and wanting to kill someone.
And then I looked up, you were standing there.
Standing beside my fire in your yellow dress like a flame.
Oh, Belle.
Belle.
Oh, please, keep away from me.
I'm afraid of you.
Whatever you say, Belle.
Why do you wear your gun in your belt?
Well, I like to know exactly where it is.
In your belt, you can feel it right up there against you all the time.
Papa says a derringer hasn't got any range.
He always wears a Colt 45.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, miss.
Why?
Well, no handgun's accurate beyond 20 feet.
And no holster gun can draw as fast as a derringer.
My papa greases the inside of his holster.
I'm afraid that wouldn't do him any good.
Also, the derringer carries a bigger slug, miss.
You can call me
Melissa, if you like.
Well, let's just compromise.
I'll call you Missy.
What's the matter?
Oh, it's only Papa.
Good morning, child of my heart.
Rosario, come get Papa's horse.
Good morning, my dear.
Good, I say, because it's one of the last we'll spend on this accursed ranch.
Did you find trail hands?
Just one.
But I'm sure two or three more will join us directly.
Not many people want to work for a living these days.
Oh, John, this is Mr. O'Malley.
How do you do?
Welcome, Mr. O'Malley.
Permit me to offer you the hospitality of these poor acres.
Thank you,
Mr. Breckenridge.
We have a saying down here in Mexico, to which I hardly subscribe.
"Everything that's mine is yours."
It's a fine saying.
I'll remember it.
You'll join me in coffee?
Thank you.
O'Malley...
I knew some O'Malleys in Virginia. Tidewater?
I'm afraid they'd be lace curtain, my people were all shanty.
After you, sir. Take that chair right over there.
I take you for a man who's handled quite a lot of cattle in his time.
Oh, I've done a little bit of almost everything.
Well, I run about
1,000 head on the place.
I plan to trail the herd up to Texas and sell them there.
Now if you're at liberty, I could...
Mr. O'Malley was trailing south.
North or south doesn't make much difference to me,
Mrs. Breckenridge.
There, you see?
I'm sure my wife echoes my sentiments in hoping you'll join us on the trail, sir.
I don't think Mr. O'Malley would be influenced by my wishes.
I hope you won't always think that, ma'am.
I'm sure that's not what she meant.
Touch up your coffee?
Thanks.
I'm willing to pay you a dollar a day, in fact.
Plus a $25 bonus when we deliver the herd in Crazy Horse, Texas.
Crazy Horse?
That's pretty dangerous country you're going through.
And you need two men you haven't got.
Fast gun and a trail boss.
I don't know any more about cows than you do, so if I go as the gun, where's the trail boss?
Well, I haven't got one.
I wasn't able to find anybody.
I know one. Good one.
Think you can get him?
He'll probably be here by tomorrow.
Maybe even today.
You think he'll take the job?
He just might.
You see, this fellow and
I are kind of bound up with each other.
But with or without him, my terms are gonna be pretty high.
Well, you just name your terms,
Mr. O'Malley.
Only two.
First I take a fifth of the herd.
It's outrageous.
Well, I fight better when part of the property's mine.
But that's exorbitant.
You think about it.
All right. All right, you've got your fifth.
Good.
Now, wait a minute, you said you had two conditions.
What's the second?
Oh, yes, the second.
I want your wife.
You're joking.
No.
If I get the herd through for you,
I mean to take your wife.
You? You and my wife?
You and Mrs. Breckenridge...
A dirty shirt Irishman and a Fitzleigh from Richmond.
Yes, I'll accept your challenge. Yes, indeed.
And you can go to work.
You can go to work at once.
Hold it, O'Malley!
They told me you'd try to circle around to get the sun in my eyes.
You did a little circling yourself.
Insurance.
The sun was in
Jimmy Graham's face when you killed him.
I don't remember.
Well, a lot of people do.
I got a warrant for your arrest.
I'm taking you back to
Frio County, Texas, to stand trial.
Will you come voluntarily or will I have to take you?
Say, it just happens that I'm just headed for Texas right now.
Crazy Horse. Of course, it isn't Frio County, but you'd die a lot closer to home than if I had to kill you here.
All right, let's go.
I'm running these cattle up there.
You?
Yeah.
With a drunken owner, no trail boss, a few
vaqueros and myself.
What do you want in that outfit you're willing to risk a hanging for?
Why don't you ride over and find out?
Why not?
You know,
Sheriff, this is Mexico.
Your warrant's no good here.
I'll serve it as soon as we cross the Rio Grande.
Is that the gentleman you were telling me about,
Mr. O'Malley?
That's him.
They need a trail boss.
Mmm-hmm.
With just the two of us riding, I can always keep you in sight.
But trailing cattle, it'd be too easy to catch a bullet in the back.
I hope Mr. O'Malley has discussed the possibilities of your joining up with us?
He has.
I'm not interested.
Why that's most unsettling.
I was counting on it.
You have any idea what you're getting yourself into?
There's nothing on that trail but rustlers and Indians.
And Johnny Rebs who crossed the border to steal what they couldn't win in a fair fight.
I do beg your pardon.
I almost lost a leg at Fredericksburg in as fair a fight as this world has ever seen.
I'm a Virginian and an officer in the armies of the Confederacy.
I'm from Virginia, too, except I served under Grant.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Oh, forgive me.
My dear, allow me to present Mr...
Stribling.
Dana Stribling.
Mr. Stribling, my wife.
Almost forgot her.
I don't see how that could be possible.
Well, bravo, you are really a Virginian.
Why don't I show Mr. Stribling around the place?
Might help him change his mind.
That's a mighty good idea, Mr. O'Malley.
It's right gracious of you.
Ma'am.
You know,
I've got a nasty feeling
I've seen you before.
You were too drunk to remember.
Bents Fort, Colorado.
So broke you were making up rhymes for whiskey.
One free drink, one free verse.
What's the matter?
Cost you a drink?
I'm gonna see that you hang, O'Malley.
Ooh! Hanging's a long-time proposition.
Well, Mr. Breckenridge, to pull the 1,000 head of cattle, you need two good point riders, four swing riders, and one man on the tail.
You need a man to drive the mules, a trail cook, a wrangler for the horses, plus four horses in the remuda for each rider.
I got plenty of horses in the remuda.
My wife drove a chuck wagon coming down here and she's perfectly willing to drive one going back.
And she's an excellent trail cook.
Then she counts for two men.
You've married well.
You ride, miss?
Oh, yes. I can even work cattle on a horse.
Good.
She can ride herd on the remuda. Give us another hand for the cattle.
My daughter's a lady.
A Southern lady.
If I'm trail boss, my word goes when it comes to running the cattle, is that right?
Well, whatever you say.
We're ready to go.
Melissa.
We'll see how Milton's doing with the herd.
Fine, Papa.
Mrs. Breckenridge, it's not often I interfere in somebody else's business, but this is one of the times
I think I should.
O'Malley's a killer, and as soon as he crosses the border into Texas,
I'm gonna see that he hangs.
Until then, my advice to you is to keep your door locked when he's around.
He can't tell one female from another.
And he don't care much, either.
Please, don't cause trouble.
Why did you say those things about Mr. O'Malley?
Because they're true.
I'm not a child,
Mr. Stribling. I'm perfectly able to take care of myself.
It won't happen again.
It's a nice night, isn't it?
Miss out on the nights, you miss half your life.
Are you a killer?
Now, why do you ask me that?
What they say.
Well, when you come right down to it, all men in their hearts are killers.
But that's wrong.
Maybe it is.
I don't know.
When a man kills, it means God let him, because God could stop him if he wanted to, couldn't he?
I don't understand.
Well, you asked if I'm a killer,
I'm trying to tell you it's not an easy question to answer, but I have killed.
But you didn't want to, did you?
No.
Do you like God?
Do you like God?
Well, of course, but...
I don't know him really.
Do you?
Part of him.
Someday I'm going to know all of him.
Oh, not all of him, Missy.
That'd be too much for anyone to know.
It would blind you.
Just learn to know rocks and trees and stars and sunlight.
They're all part of God, too.
Learn to know the sea.
I will when we get to California.
Good. Find yourself a nice big boulder with the waves breaking against it.
Look deep.
Dream of seahorses and they'll come.
Not many people know of it, not many people care, but the sea is a place where the seamen shoe the hooves of the wild sea-mare.
Not many people have seen it, nor caught the faintest gleam of the ice-green cave in the deep green sea in the heart of the cold sea-stream, where the sea-mare hides her young sea-colt wrapped in a shy sea-dream.
But practically all of the people known can absolutely say that the foam on the sea is a sign that you see the mare and her colt at play.
Oh, I like that.
Did you make that up?
A drunk made that up, sitting in a saloon in Bents Fort, Colorado.
Give him a subject, he'd write a verse. "One free drink, one free verse."
That must've been a part of God, too.
God in him.
Of course it was.
God has a special love for drunks and fools and children like you.
I'm not a child.
I'm almost 16 years old.
I'm a woman.
Oh, Missy.
Put it away.
When I kill you, it'll be face-to-face with both of us on our feet.
I'd like to believe that.
You can.
And here's something else you can believe, too.
Never talk to me again the way you did tonight.
The truth hurts, doesn't it?
The truth hurts.
I'd like to know the truth about you.
Just being sheriff isn't enough reason to follow a man this far.
What was Jimmy Graham to you?
Hmm?
He was married to my sister.
Your sister?
Mmm.
So that's where the bear sits, in the buckwheat.
Pretty little girl
Mr. Stribling!
You left a calf behind.
Where?
He lost his mother.
Well, we'll have to give him a new one.
Come on.
Come over here, miss.
Now, blow your breath three or four times in each side of his nose.
Go ahead.
Keep on petting him.
That's right.
Now, stay right where you are so you're the first thing he sees.
Get back on your horse.
See, miss, cattle don't see very well.
The only way this little fellow can tell his mother from any other cow is by her smell.
When he loses that, he's an orphan.
So we give him a new smell to follow.
You're his new mama.
Now, walk away slowly, see what he does.
Thanks for saving that calf back there.
Why should you thank me?
Well, that calf could have been mine.
Yours?
Sure.
You see, part of my deal with Breckenridge was that
I get a fifth of the herd.
A fifth?
Well, I delivered him the best trail boss in the business, didn't I?
That's worth something, isn't it?
Come on now, my fifth.
Hey, there!
Come on there, boy!
Mr. Stribling, you may make camp wherever you wish.
I'm riding on ahead to Tres Santos.
That's a pretty rough town,
Mr. Breckenridge.
I think I can find extra hands there.
This time you can really count on me, Mrs. B.
I swear I'd sooner milk a wildcat.
Come on, Jack-boy.
Come on, Jack-boy.
Jack-boy, come on. Come on.
Come on, Jack-boy.
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on, Jack-boy.
That's a boy.
Your husband get back from town yet?
No. I hope he hasn't run into any trouble.
Maybe I ought to ride in, see how he's making out.
I wish you would.
All right.
Get me some tobacco, will you?
I don't know your brand.
Oh, any kind will do.
Maybe you ought to come along.
Pick it out yourself.
Oh, it's not that important.
Take your time.
I'll just stick around here and keep an eye on things.
Right, Jackie-boy?
I only suggested you come along.
Now I'm telling you to.
On your way, cowpoke.
That's an order,
O'Malley.
What did you say?
Bren, please go with him.
Don't make trouble for us.
Whatever you want, Belle, that's the way it's going to be.
Gentlemen, our cups are running dry of nectar.
Patron, a drink for my friends, and everyone is my friend.
Bartender, drinks all around.
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
A toast to a great soldier, a devout Christian.
To the bravest of the brave,
General Stonewall Jackson.
You're not fit to speak that name, sir.
At whose side it was my privilege to fight during the long and tragic years of the war between the states.
Gentlemen,
I give you General...
Reach for your gun, sir.
I decline to shed the blood of a fellow Virginian.
You decline every kind of a fight, don't you?
It's right nice seeing you again,
Breckenridge.
We had the privilege of fighting alongside him under Stonewall Jackson at Fredericksburg.
And he ran.
That's not true.
He didn't just run, he deserted us!
That's just not true.
I was wounded at
Fredericksburg.
Where were you wounded?
Go ahead and show us where you were wounded,
Breckenridge.
Yes, sir. Show us.
We would all like to see.
Well, the wound is obvious.
I limp...
Drop your pants and show us your backside.
You've no right to ask me to do that.
Your pants.
Or your gun.
Show us your wound.
Oh, God, is there no mercy?
Show us the wound!
Talking's all right, you can say anything you want, but no man has the right to make another man do this.
Keep out of this.
What's he to you, sir?
Don't ask questions, mister.
Just do what the man says.
Let's get out...
Now wait a minute...
You shut up!
Let's go, Mr. Breckenridge.
I don't think we're welcome here.
How'd my papa really die?
Like we said, some buffalo skinners started to make trouble and...
Well, your father waded in to stop it...
You make that up because of Mama?
'Cause she knows.
And so do I.
Know what?
That Mr. Breckenridge was too gentle to ever get into a fight.
Maybe that was the good in him.
Bedtime, Melissa.
So early?
It's not early, it's late.
Goodnight, Mr. O'Malley.
Goodnight, Missy.
Well, I'm ashamed of you,
Stribling.
Poor Breckenridge isn't even cold yet and already you're thinking of his widow.
You might be right.
Forget it, cowpoke.
She's mine.
I'd worry about that if
I thought you were gonna live long enough.
Well, when the time comes, you'll see.
Don't count on it.
You'll never get the chance again to ruin a woman's life.
You're still talking about that sister of yours?
You like the truth?
Here it is.
Your sister put more horns on Jimmy Graham than a porcupine's got quills.
By the time he got himself killed, he wasn't good for anything except maybe to stuff and hang over the fireplace.
That sister of yours,
Stribling, was just a free drink on the house.
And nobody ever went home thirsty.
I mean nobody.
If you two want to kill each other, go ahead.
But at least wait until you cross the border and fulfill your contract.
If you're not going to stick with it, get out now.
By the way, O'Malley, three days after you killed Jimmy Graham, my kid sister took a length of rawhide and hung herself.
Now what's wrong?
Just pointing the wagon tongue toward the North star.
Help us get our bearings in the morning.
If that's such a good idea, why haven't we done it before,
Mr. Stribling?
Probably because I didn't need an excuse to talk to you before.
Oh.
I just want to tell you not to worry.
I mean to bring that herd through in good shape, you can count on me.
Good.
There's one thing more.
If you'll pardon my saying so, you know, sometimes it only makes grief worse when you bottle it up.
Thank you.
If you...
When you're feeling better, if you need a friend to talk to about your plans for the future,
I mean, your plans and Melissa's,
I'd like to be that friend.
I'll remember that,
Mr. Stribling.
Good night.
Good night.
I didn't know there were any women connected with this outfit.
Make any difference?
Not to me, it don't.
Women like that are worth
$1,500 a piece delivered to a Dutchman in Veracruz.
That's more than a whole herd's worth.
You're looking for somebody?
Fellow named
Breckenridge.
Hired us to go through with this outfit to
Crazy Horse, Texas.
We heard he got killed.
So we trailed you from Tres Santos.
Figured you could really use some more hands.
We got a paper he signed.
Show him.
Paper doesn't matter.
We need men.
Have you got names?
Sure. Frank Hobbs.
This is my brother Ed, that fellow over there calls himself the Julesburg Kid.
All right.
Let's get to work.
Hey, kid.
You hard of hearing?
All right, we got a big herd of cows here.
All round here.
Now, bunch them up so we can move out of here right away.
Well, now, you ought to move over there, lady.
Let me handle them mules for you.
I'll be right with you just as soon as I tie my horse on behind here.
You're hard of hearing.
Well, you know, when
I get through with you, you're gonna like them cattle so much you'll never want to leave them.
Come on,
Julesburg Kid, let's go!
Let's go! That's it!
Hold on! Hold on!
Hold on, there!
Sit on your horse, that's it.
Come here, come here.
Don't be that way.
Come here!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stay on your horse, there.
Come on, stay on that horse.
That's it!
Now you got it! Come on!
Let's go again, huh? Come on!
On we go! That's it.
Isn't this fun?
Isn't this fun?
Don't you reach for your gun again.
Now work for your dollar.
Hey, hold it, Missy.
You know a funny thing about a horse?
He can see a gopher hole about a mile off, and yet...
Let me show you something.
Look.
And yet he can't even see a bird's nest right under his nose.
There's no reason to be nervous.
I'm going to take you alive. Remember?
What did he mean?
All he meant was you're going to have horses scattered all over the countryside, unless you get back to work pronto, miss.
All right.
We may be able to use a killer on this drive after all.
I don't think there's any danger in here.
We better stand watch around here, just the same.
We'll spread out among the herd tonight.
Take your bedroll with you.
Get as much sleep as you can.
O'Malley and I will ride herd.
If I were an Indian,
I could've picked up some mighty easy scalps just then.
I'm glad you weren't.
Come here. I want to show you something.
Don't be afraid.
You won't need that shooting iron. Come on.
Something out there you could live five lifetimes and never see again.
Look.
Saint Elmo's fire.
Never seen it except on ships.
I've never seen it anywhere. What is it?
Well, a star fell and smashed and scattered its glow all over the place.
There, you see?
You laughed.
You're getting used to me again.
I was really thinking that you haven't changed a bit.
How do you mean that?
Oh, you've still got that wildness on the tip of your tongue.
I've still got you in my heart, too.
Look, Belle, I know this hasn't been a good trip for you, but, well, we're going to have smooth sailing from here on out.
You really don't want smooth sailing, Bren.
You carry your own storm wherever you go.
Only when I travel alone.
Belle.
Look at me.
I'm trying to tell you how much I love you.
No, Bren.
You loved a 16-year-old girl.
In another country.
In another world almost.
And you still think
I'm that girl.
You are.
I'm not.
The girl you remember died a long, long time ago.
But the minute
I look at you, she comes alive again.
Can't you see that,
Belle?
Don't you know what
I've done for you?
Something only love could do?
I stopped time from touching you.
I trapped you in my heart the very first day I saw you, and I've never let you change.
Oh, Belle, 100 years from now, my eyes could look at you and still see a pretty little girl in a yellow dress.
You've said it all.
Don't you see, Bren?
I don't want to be loved as if I were a frightened, shivering, innocent little girl.
I have to be loved for what I am.
I'm a woman with the heart and the mind and the flesh of a woman.
I'm not young and
I'm not innocent.
There's so much more to me to be loved than just that.
But you don't see it.
Because you don't want to.
You're up awful early this morning.
Why, yes, I am.
Do you think that's wise?
Walking around here unarmed?
Just wanted to see this little church in the daylight.
Yeah.
Lots of hopes, lots of prayers must've started here.
Or ended.
Babies being christened.
Women burying their dead.
Sometimes men, too.
Men?
I lost my wife and two daughters in an Osage war party.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid I was only thinking of myself.
To me, it's always seemed like the women who keep on living.
Men kill or get killed.
And women bury them.
We're professional survivors.
Belle, last night...
I couldn't help seeing you and O'Malley talking together.
And I had the feeling that you two have met before sometime.
I mean, way before we began this cattle drive.
Have you?
I don't think you have the right to ask me that question, Mr. Stribling.
But I give myself that right, because I mean to marry you.
That gives me every right in the world.
Will I have anything to say about this marriage?
Not until I ask you.
And I can't ask until I square things off with him.
Then you'll have a lot to say about it.
Excuse me.
No reason to be offended.
But you might just as well forget you ever saw him, because I'm the man you're going to marry.
I mean what I say, Belle.
O'Malley!
Hold up the herd!
What did you think you were doing?
I was protecting my fifth of the herd.
You get on back there and get the outfit ready to stand off an attack.
I didn't sign up to fight Yaquis.
Well, I ain't about to fight them, either.
Get the wagon and the remuda over here and we'll surround them with the herd.
Get ready.
Hold it.
They've got Stribling.
All they wanted was a little fresh beef.
You could've got him killed.
Not yet.
How many herd did you have to give?
One-fifth of the herd!
O'Malley's fifth.
Never did like cows much anyhow.
Quicksand!
Watch where you ride!
Throw me a rope.
Let's have a rope.
Think you might find a way to tear up that warrant?
Not a chance.
Hold your hands over your head.
The big guy is stuck in the quicksand.
Don't get the wrong idea,
Stribling.
If Belle didn't need you to get these cattle through, you'd be on the bottom now, alongside your horse.
That's the way I figured.
I killed Frank Hobbs.
Well, there she is.
We made it.
Sure is beautiful.
I got plenty of vaqueros to help us make the crossing.
Crazy Horse is on the other side, just beyond that ridge.
When do we cross over?
First thing in the morning.
You mean we're going to have to make camp again?
When there's a town in plain sight?
Well, it's too late to try today, Melissa.
All right, let's get these cattle moving towards the river.
You know, Missy, you and your mother could make the crossing now, and spend a comfortable night in town.
I'd like that.
We've come this far, Melissa.
We might as well spend one more night.
Well, I sure would like a nice bath.
You know, this is our last night in Mexico.
Let's celebrate.
Let's have a fiesta.
A fiesta? Can we get all dressed up?
Why not?
O'Malley? O'Malley?
Yes?
We're going to have a fiesta tonight. Will you dance with me?
Sure will. Dance with you all night long.
Oh, Mr. O'Malley, if you decide not to cross the border with us,
I'll be glad to send your wages after
I've sold the herd.
I'll think about it.
I'm only a sham.
I haven't any slippers.
I wouldn't wear boots.
Do you like it?
Very much.
It was my mother's.
Could've been made for you.
Melissa, where did you find that dress?
In your trunk.
It's been torn.
Oh, yes, it is.
Did you know that, Mama?
Yes. Someone gave me a corsage of primroses.
And a very jealous boy ripped them off and stomped on them. Tore the dress.
I think that's romantic.
Well, some day I'll give those primroses back to you.
Dance with me.
Pretty little girl
in the yellow dress
When are you going to give
Your heart to me?
I intend to keep on asking
Until you answer yes
Pretty little girl
In the pretty
little yellow dress
I looked and
saw you standing there
Like fire-glow
on a winding stair
So young you were,
so proud, so fair
With candlelight
to preen your hair
Pretty little girl
in the yellow dress
Your watch, O'Malley.
When you...
Hey. You're a long ways from your wagon.
What are you doing here?
Are you going to cross over?
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
If you stay here in Mexico,
I'm staying here with you.
Why do you say a thing like that?
Because I love you.
Oh, Missy, you only think you do.
And you mustn't...
Don't say that I mustn't.
I've loved you from the very first minute
I saw you.
And now I'm all filled up with love for you.
Have you said anything like this to your mother?
No. Not yet.
Besides...
Besides what?
You've seen the way she looks at Mr. Stribling.
She won't be lonely for me for much longer.
Missy.
Look at me.
And listen to me.
Now you're young, too young...
I'm not.
Girls here marry when they're much younger than I am.
In Mexico, I'm a woman.
Why is it you always make such a ruckus over being a woman?
Because it's important.
I can sew, keep house and cook better than any woman you ever knew.
Of course you can.
And one these days, a boy'll come along...
I don't want a boy.
I want you.
You want someone who'll fill your heart with warmth and sunlight.
You want a young man, not me.
All I can do is throw a cloud over you...
I'm not afraid of clouds.
I'm not afraid of anything.
If you can see so much beauty just by looking into the ocean waves, why can't you see just a little something to love in me?
Oh, Missy, I do.
I do, Missy.
I look at you and all I see is loveliness.
Please try to get used to me.
And if you don't love me right now, please try to learn.
Oh, Missy.
I've loved you all my life.
Take me with you wherever you go?
For as long as you want, thanking God every step of the way that I found you.
There's Texas.
It's a lovely sight.
Hey, do we cross the border in the middle of the river or when we get to the other side?
Well, I don't know.
Well, you like everything legal, don't you?
Oh, yeah.
You still want to serve that warrant?
That's right.
I'm not accepting it, you know.
That's what I figured.
What's that do to our showdown?
Maybe we ought to get the work done first.
Gives us one more hand.
I'll come for you at sundown.
I'll be waiting for you.
Ho, there. Come on.
I'll meet you back here as soon as I get cleaned up.
I'll be waiting!
You could stop this thing if you didn't hate him so.
I don't hate him.
I did, at first.
It's hard to keep on hating somebody you've come to know.
Then let him go.
Forget about him.
I was almost hoping he wouldn't cross over.
Please.
Sorry, Belle.
Belle.
What is O'Malley to you?
Or what was he?
I knew him years ago, when I was a girl.
I haven't seen him since.
Until he came to the ranch.
Were you in love with him?
I thought I was.
I was afraid of that.
You can't think there's anything now?
No, Belle.
I'll meet you back here for supper.
Oh, Dana.
Please. If you really love me, you won't gamble your life away like this.
Remember, it's my life, too.
Belle, I do really love you.
Oh, then don't fight him.
There must be a way out. Find it.
Oh, promise me you will.
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Breckenridge.
You look beautiful.
I had to see you, Bren.
I have to talk to you.
All right. Let's talk.
I want to thank you for all you've done for me and Melissa.
That's all right.
But don't you think you should get out of the country, before something happens?
What could happen?
Well, if you stay here, you'll...
Either you'll have another murder on your hands, or you'll be killed.
You're not thinking about me. You're worried about Stribling.
You love him. You don't want to see him killed.
That's fair enough.
I'm not thinking of Stribling.
You're a real woman,
Belle.
Sorry that cowpoke won't live long enough to know what he's got.
It's not Stribling.
It's Melissa.
She told me.
I can't let you take her, Bren.
I won't.
Look, Belle.
Missy'll be safe with me.
Nothing bad will ever happen to her while I'm with her.
I promise that.
But it won't last, Bren.
She's so young, it can't.
It will.
You see, Missy and I need each other. I don't know how it happened, but she loves me in a way she'll never love any other man.
You don't know what you're saying.
But I do. I want Missy.
And she belongs to me.
I love her more than
I love my own life.
Don't you know why?
Bren, you must.
She's your daughter.
It's true.
You know it's true.
What're you trying to do to me, Belle?
Do you think
I wouldn't know my own daughter?
Even if I never saw her before,
I'd know my daughter.
The minute I looked at her, I'd feel it.
You're lying.
What a dirty thing to do.
You're lying. You're lying.
You're lying.
Señor O'Malley.
Señor O'Malley.
Missy.
O'Malley?
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing.
I was just thinking what a beautiful girl you've turned out to be.
Beautiful, beautiful girl.
Missy, let's take a walk.
Wonderful.
Got my things all packed.
Good.
Are you going to have to fight Mr. Stribling?
We decided on tomorrow, but we leave today.
You know, I feel as if
I've been looking for you all my life.
Without knowing who you were or even what you looked like.
Then I found you.
And now,
I'll have you forever.
Forever?
Mmm-hmm.
You know something, Missy?
I'm old enough to be your father.
What difference does that make?
Well, it means that some day, you'll be alone.
I won't be with you anymore, and so you'll have to find someone else to love.
That's silly.
I couldn't love anybody else but you. I couldn't.
There's something wrong with us, Missy.
But why?
Because if you ever really love, you have to go on loving.
It's like a mountain spring.
If it stops flowing, there's no more spring.
And if you stop loving, just because something happens to me, there's no more Missy.
You mean, you'd want me to find somebody else?
If you really loved me, you'd have to find someone else.
And the day you found him, and gave him all the love you once gave me...
Oh, Missy, Missy.
On that day, all the angels in heaven will shout for joy.
And the stars will bend low to chime your wedding bells.
And I'll hear them.
And I'll smile.
And then I'll go to sleep again, content.
Missy?
Are you all through?
I'm not sure.
Because I'm not listening.
Already I'm a bore.
No.
It's time to get our horses.
I'll pick up your saddlebags at the hotel.
You wait for me right here.
You'll come right back to me, won't you?
When that sun goes down over there, just below the rim of the hills,
I'll come right back to you.
O'Malley!
It wasn't even loaded.
He told me to give you this, in case anything happened.
Primroses.
You said you'd give them to me.
THE WAR WAGON
Sheriff, Taw Jackson's back in town.
Are you sure? - He's ridin' down the street right now, big as life.
Goin' huntin'?
Oon't do anything real fast.
You fellas seem real jumpy.
How'd you get out?
- Parole. - After only three years?
Good behaviour.
This paper says l have to report in to the local law officer wherever l am.
Check-in day is Monday.
Figurin' on stickin' around?
For a while. - Your old spread belongs to Mr Pierce now. - L heard that.
Lt's his legally, so you stay off it.
Oh, l'll sure do that.
Maybe prison took some of the starch out of you.
Maybe.
Where's Lomax?
- Ln Randado. The Oriental Palace.
Billy Hyatt's in Chubisco.
- Levi?
He's down by Mesquite, with Calita's gang.
What about the shipment?
- The big one's four days from now.
Ooesn't give us much time.
Nope.
Put back that salt.
The salt!
Pierce catches you stealin' now, you won't be worth a damn to me.
Mr Pierce. - Oid it get here yet?
- No, it will by the trip after next.
That's when we want her.
Alright, let's clean her up.
Check the rim on the left front wheel.
- Yes, sir.
Beauty!
Mr Pierce, Taw Jackson's in town.
- What?
He's out on parole.
- Where is he? - l don't know.
Oon't you know he could take a shot at Mr Pierce? - Get Hammond and Brown.
You think he'll try somethin'?
- Wouldn't you?
L want you in Rondado before sun-up.
Find Lomax.
L want him to kill Taw Jackson.
L'll pay him anything he wants.
You'll pay him anything, sir?
L'll go for 10,000.
Hell, Mr Pierce, we'd be willin' to do it for a lot less than 10,000.
Lf you could. Lomax is the one man that can, so get movin'.
Yes, sir.
Boss, you know the way they feel about each other.
Lomax would probably kill him for nothin'.
Unless there's money in it,
Lomax'll do nothin' for nothin'.
And l want Taw Jackson dead.
What'll ya have?
- Whiskey.
L understand Lomax is around.
So?
L wanna see him.
- Yeah, and who are you?
Taw Jackson.
Enjoy you're drink.
Lt'll be your last.
Well, that'd be a shame.
Kinda hoped that my last drink'd be a big one.
Bottle's in front of you. Pour it out.
Gonna shoot me in the back?
- You deserve it.
You caused me a lot of embarrassment.
- How?
You're the only man l ever shot and didn't kill.
Well, if it makes you feel any better, that slug you put in me kept me in hospital for six months.
What made you think l wouldn't kill you?
Curiosity.
Well, you're still alive.
Now what's to keep you that way?
Money.
- How much?
Your share'll be over 100,000.
That's what l've always said the world needs:
More simple understanding to bring people together. Lhotse! Khaloo!
We can talk upstairs.
- What l have to say is private.
Can't get more private. Neither one of them speaks a word of English.
Come on in!
L hope this'll be friendlier than last time. - Couldn't be unfriendlier.
Know why Pierce wanted you to kill me?
So he could legally steal your land, once he found there was gold on it.
You were just defending your ranch.
But you got shot, framed and sent to jail.
Thought that was kind of amusing.
Nice to find a fella with a keen sense of humour.
Old Pierce found a lotta gold on your land.
That ore assays out at $643 a tonne, normally.
But they've hit the motherlode, which'll be 1200 per cent richer.
For a man out a short while you know a lot about his business.
He's important to me.
- You thinkin' about his gold?
My gold.
- Forget it.
You can't get within a mile of it.
Have some grub.
No thanks. How about outta town?
He has a new toy. An iron-plated thing he calls the War Wagon.
Takes an average of 50,000 in gold from Emmett to the station in El Paso.
Forty-three miles away.
- There are a few guards.
Thirty-three of them. Twenty-eight outriders and five in the coach.
Each man has a Henry repeating rifle, two Colts and 200 rounds.
So what?
- We're going to take that wagon.
We are?
You taken a look lately at the cemetery at Emmett?
There's a big bunch of cheap wooden crosses, all crowded in together.
That's a tribute to the last fools who tried to stop the War Wagon.
You like facts? $1.15 for the casket, and 12 cents for the crosses.
Pierce foots the bill.
$1.27 seems a poor price to pay for a man's life, especially mine.
Ln four days, Pierce is going to make the biggest gold shipment ever.
A half a million dollars.
A half a million? How we gonna take it, with the Prussian army?
With three others. Five of us.
Five. L'm kinda glad l didn't kill you tonight. You're funny.
Wanna hear how?
- How we end up in jail or on the run?
Not my way.
- No chance.
$100,000, Lomax, that's your share.
You ready to listen?
Why me? - You're good with guns.
And the only safecracker l know.
How'd you find that out?
- An old friend of yours in prison.
For the last time, are you gonna listen?
Alright. Let's hear it.
Stony Flats. The War Wagon.
Yeah!
One condition.
- What's that?
My time till the robbery costs $100 a day, and if l fire my gun $500.
Haven't got that kind of money.
L'll take a marker against your share.
Lt's a deal.
You always wear a gun?
Just lately.
Morning, Mr Lomax. - Hello, Smitty.
- You want l should saddle your horse?
Your in the third stall on the left.
There he is.
Lomax!
- Morning, Lomax.
What do ya want?
Mr Pierce would like to talk to you.
- What for?
Lt's about Taw Jackson.
What about Taw Jackson?
Mr Pierce said he'll go all the way up to 10,000 dollars.
Hey, Taw, you hear that?
- L heard.
You're worth a lot of money. Oead.
Taw, this wasn't our idea at all.
We're just deliverin' a message.
Yeah.
What's your answer?
Tell him l'll be thinkin' about it.
Yes, sir, we sure will. Come on.
The boss ain't gonna like that answer.
- L know it.
Why don't we do it?
Mr Pierce would be very grateful.
Ain't no better time!
Mine hit the ground first.
Mine was taller.
Yes, sir, a good way to start our partnership.
How's that?
- A $500 day.
L didn't ask for your help back there.
- Can't afford to let you get killed unless l do it.
Hey, why are we headed south?
- To pick up Levi Walking Bear.
Levi who?
- Walking Bear.
He's running with Calita's gang, down on the border.
Pretty rough outfit.
- Yeah. Well, we need him.
He's worth 100,000 dollars to ya.
Ninety.
Buenos días.
- Buenos días.
Whose pigs are these?
Yours?
Fine.
Lnformation?
Buenos días, Señorita.
- Welcome, Señor. Tequila?
Sure.
Thank you. Salud!
You're a pretty little girl.
- Little girl?
Well, you're not a little boy.
Where's Calita's camp?
Oon't know.
Are you sure?
Well, then. How about a drink?
A little one.
That's good!
Gracias, Señor.
Where did you get that?
- L sleep on this ring.
Yes, every night like this.
For the tequila.
Oo you not want anything else?
- Later.
Let's go.
- Go where?
Calita's. Third canyon south, two miles up.
You have to appeal to their intellect.
Let me guess which one's your friend.
Hey, don't shoot!
Well...
- Yeah.
Come on. Yah!
Hey, comrades! Ready?
Who the hell are you?
- Shut up. Oon't drop your arm.
What?
Where ya goin'?
- Another target.
Get outta here!
My horses! Where are my horses?
Looks like we made it.
Thanks, Taw. You might say l owe you fellas my life. - Yeah, yuh might.
Lomax. Levi Walking Bear.
So you're Lomax.
- What was that all about back there?
We were playin' poker.
- So?
L was cheatin'.
Hey, you got a bargain, big man.
- How's that?
Two $500 days for the price of one.
Thanks.
Why'd you stick your necks out for me?
We got a job for yuh.
Lomax, l want you to swing over to Chubisco. - Chubisco?
Pick up Billy Hyatt and bring him out to the old mission.
Sure hate being away from yuh.
That's how it's gonna have to be.
Oon't let anything happen to yuh.
Not likely.
Beautiful thing to see. Friendship.
Yeah.
You seen a fella named Billy Hyatt?
Yeah.
Where?
- There.
What are ya doin'?
You Billy Hyatt?
- Yeah.
Stand up.
L can't even sit up.
- Come on, l said stand up!
L'm doin' ma best.
Got a horse? - What?
- Have yuh got a horse? - No.
Come on.
L ain't goin' no place. Let me alone.
Let me off, Mister. - Not yet, sonny.
- My head's splittin'.
Yuh stink!
Tell me kid, what are you good for?
Good for?
- You heard me.
Nothin'. L'm good for nothin'.
- L believe it. Taw must be loco.
Taw Jackson? Ls he out?
- We're on our way to join him.
Ooggone! Me and him spent two years in prison together. - Heart-warming.
That means Taw must be ready to...
- Yes?
A thing we talked about.
Listen, mister, this has gone far enough. Let me down.
L will, sonny, l will.
What did you do that for?
You share my horse, l want you sober.
And cleaner.
You can walk yourself dry.
Who's that?
The War Wagon.
- So that's it.
You in with Taw?
- More or less.
Then l reckon l can tell you what l'm good for. Explosives.
Explosives?
Hammond and Brown get back?
- No, Sir. - What about Lomax?
Lomax? Not again.
Hello, Jackson.
Lt's Monday morning, and l'm reporting in.
That's no concern of mine.
Tell the deputy or the sheriff.
Same thing, you own 'em.
- Alright, Taw, you're reported in.
L hear you're stayin' at my ranch.
- Lt used to be yours. Nice place.
L oughta know. L built it.
- And you did a real fine job.
L'll be out there one day this week.
- Thinkin' of tryin' to get it back?
Think about it all the time.
- You wouldn't stand a chance.
Tell you what l'll do for you, though.
L'll see that you get buried there.
Between then and now, l'm comin' out to pick up my stuff. Lt still there?
How would l know?
- Oh, it all disappeared, somehow.
- Ain't nothin' there belongs to you.
This man's wearin' my gun.
You're wrong. My Pa gave me this.
Lf you want it back, Taw, why don't you take it away from him.
Lt's mine.
What's goin' on?
- Just collectin' somethin' of mine.
Who started it?
- L guess you could say l did.
The shells in here belong to him.
He can come and get them anytime.
Throw some water on 'em.
Taw!
L heard.
Hey, Taw!
- Hello, Billy. - How ya keepin'?
You look worse than you did in jail.
- Nothin' a drink wouldn't fix.
Got anything?
- He's a drunk. - He drinks.
Way he's been shakin', l wouldn't trust him with a firecracker.
Ls that true, Billy?
- Some folks look at it that way.
But l'm alright, Taw. L can handle it.
There's a lot at stake here.
- L can handle it.
Good enough.
- L don't trust drunks.
Neither do l. But Billy stays here.
And there's nothing stronger than that cowboy coffee you're drinkin'.
You're sure he knows explosives?
He handles them like you do a gun.
Hope you know what you're doin'.
That'll be Wes.
Come on, come on.
Sit down! - What's she doing here?
- She goes every place l go.
Lomax, this is Fletcher.
He's going to haul the gold away.
Why him?
- L work for Pierce.
Nobody'll find half a million in gold in Pierce's own flour barrel.
Half a million?
When do we split it up?
Wouldn't be too smart to flash gold around right after the robbery.
We should wait about six months.
- Six months?
Let's don't spend it before we get it.
Hands off my wife! - L thought she was your daughter. - Well, she ain't!
Billy!
- You keep away from her!
A drunk kid and a crazy old man!
- Cut it out, all of ya!
You're not here to be the best of friends. We've work to do, and only three days to do it in.
Come on over here.
This map shows the run from Emmett to El Paso.
Ln the morning, Billy, l want you to ride it and check these two places.
Find out how much dynamite you're gonna need.
The wagon takes five and a half minutes to cross Stony Flats.
That's where we'll hit it first.
Well, see ya later, partner.
- Where you goin'? - To town.
L got another partner there, remember?
- L remember.
We wouldn't want him to be impatient, and hire somebody else.
Take good care of him.
Levi...
Let us pass!
Alright.
We walk from here.
Oumb lndians!
Looks like they're movin' out.
- They are.
Squaws, old men, children.
Pierce has starved them out.
What about Wild Horse?
- He's staying.
Pierce'll hunt him down too.
Oumb lndians!
And you're smart? - Sure! L've learned to live in a white man's world.
Grab all you can, anytime you can.
Wait here.
Your enemy is my enemy.
- Taw!
Chief Wild Horse, Natani Jackson.
- Too many warriors have died.
He says, Your enemy is his enemy.
- Good.
No. He says he will lose too many braves.
Ask him does he ride with warriors or women.
Lf you want my tribe and my warriors, l will do it.
He will do it, but he wants more of everything. - He does or you do?
Bargain with him.
- What exactly do you want?
600 bullets.
20 rifles. A dozen blankets.
And 30 pounds of salt.
Tell him he drives a hard bargain.
But we'll agree.
You can stay.
But the white man must go.
Lt is done. He wants me to stay to dinner, but you're not welcome.
Having a white man here offends him.
- You can tell him... - What?
Nothing.
Three sixes.
- Beats me.
Hello, Lola.
Lt's been a long time, Lomax.
May l join you? - Sure.
- Looks like you're still a winner.
L lose every once in a while.
How's your laundry service?
Oh, they can't even speak English.
- A pity.
Any limit?
Lf there was, you wouldn't play.
Fifty.
- L'm out.
Lola! - Hello, Mr Pierce.
- Too rich for me.
Two cards.
- You get my message? - Yeah.
Took you long enough to get here.
- L had things to do.
What happened to those two men?
L last saw them in the main street in Randado. Three ladies.
You win, precious.
Let's go someplace private.
- L like it here.
Hey, barkeeper how much for whiskey around here?
Two bits.
That's two cents.
You gonna give me an answer or not?
- L'm thinkin' about it.
How much is that?
- 27 cents.
Set it right there.
Keep the change.
- Thanks.
L'll go twelve thousand.
Twelve?
L changed my mind.
Give me another two cents' worth!
Go out and walk it off.
Listen, l figure on bein' an important person some day.
You wanna treat me right.
Oh, l will.
What do yuh say?
- L'm still thinking about it.
Come on, bartender.
- Not for two cents.
But l done told you, me and my friends are gonna be rich!
Sure. Well, come back then.
Hello there, cowboy.
You havin' trouble gettin' a drink?
L'm gonna buy this... hey!
What's goin' on down there?
This drunk just insulted the lady.
Lock him up till he sleeps it off.
What'd he do?
- You didn't notice?
No.
- You been workin' saloons too long.
What'd you do that for?
- L hate bad manners.
L'm gettin' tired of this run-around.
Yes or no on the twelve thousand?
Yes.
And l want it done quick. - Oon't push me. L'll do it when l'm ready!
What's your pleasure?
Stud.
What room is Señor Lomax in?
Five, Señor.
Five?
Who's there?
- Lt's me.
We may be in trouble.
Billy's missing... - He's in jail.
Ln jail?
- Orunk.
You know how close he came to naming all his rich friends? - No.
That close. - L guarantee he'll never take another drop.
You guarantee that he won't blow us all sky high?
He knows what he's doin'.
- L don't care what he knows.
L've stayed alive by not relying on anybody. L always go it alone.
Precious?
Always?
Ls anything wrong?
No, baby.
You just straighten out that kid.
And Pierce upped the ante on you.
You're worth 12,000 to me. Oead.
And 100,000 alive.
One's a gamble. Other's a sure thing.
Lomax, nothin's a sure thing.
Precious?
L didn't feel much like shootin' you this morning anyway, partner.
Neither did l... precious.
Hey!
L haven't got time to tell you what's on my mind.
Go out to Wes's place and wait for me.
Supposed to meet Taw here.
How's your hand?
L said, how's your hand.
- Fine.
Wes is due back any time.
You best wait in the house.
Oon't he let you talk to anybody?
- To nobody.
Reckon you can talk to me, then.
L'm nobody.
How old are yuh?
- Eighteen, l think.
Me too... far as l know.
Say... how come you're married to Wes?
L ain't, really. He bartered me.
Bartered yuh?
Folks traded me for twenty dollars and a horse. They's poor.
L'd call that a lot worse than poor.
Ain't much never mind.
Same here as it was with them.
Oo your work and keep your mouth shut.
- Twenty dollars and a horse.
You're worth... a little more than that.
How come you're in on this stealin'?
For the money.
L'm gonna have me 100,000 dollars.
Make me a very important person.
Why?
'Cause it will.
What are you doin' here?
- Taw told me to meet him here.
He tell you to hang around my wife?
- Should l wait up on the mountain?
Oon't sass me, boy. - He ain't done nothin'. - Get back to work!
Leave her alone!
Come on, boy.
- Fletcher! Put it away.
Come here, Billy.
You're not going to say a word, or make a move, unless l tell yuh.
You go over the route? - Yeah.
What are yuh gonna need? - How long is the wagon, from the lead horse back?
Forty-seven and a half feet.
L'll need about 500 feet of two-ounce hemp twine, four bottles of gin...
Gin?
You said time is important.
- That's right. - Then no dynamite.
Fuses don't burn that dependable.
What are you figurin' on?
- Nitroglycerine.
Nitro?
Wes!
- Yeah.
He's figurin' on usin' nitroglycerine.
You know where there is any?
- Pierce has got some.
Where does he keep it?
- At your ranch, in a safe.
Ln a safe? You know the combination?
- No.
Let me show yuh somethin'.
Ever see a shell like this before?
- Yeah.
L took in 10,000 rounds to Pierce last week.
A Gatling gun.
L just seen Jackson in the
Lucky Oeuce, and Lomax is in there.
Get the sheriff.
L want this whole thing to be legal.
Bartender, set 'em up on me.
L buy my own.
You refusing my hospitality?
L'm ignoring it.
Well, l take that as an insult.
You take it any way you want.
Whiskey!
L said, whiskey!
We don't serve lndians.
- Then l serve myself.
Have one with me.
- Sure.
No thanks!
You too good to drink with lndian?
- That's right.
Oh no!
You might say l saved your life.
- Yeah!
What you do that for?
- Get the horses!
L'm the one you hired to shoot Jackson.
Why didn't you? You had the chance.
- He never went for his gun.
What are yuh gonna' do?
- L'm goin' after him.
Lomax!
What sort of stupid stunt was that?
We need you tonight.
- You said tomorrow.
Change of plan. The kid wants nitro.
Nitroglycerine?
- Lt's in a safe you have to open.
Forget it! L'm not gonna be anywhere near that drunk and nitro.
That cut's it!
Nobody takes a half a million just sittin' around.
Either you cut it out, or we call the whole thing off.
Alright. Lt'll cost ya 2,000 more.
- Not from me. - Then forget it.
Take 2,000 of mine.
You're a good lndian.
- Alright, Levi.
Go pick up Wild Horse.
We'll get the kid.
Hey, Taw.
For a minute at the saloon, l thought you were gonna draw.
For a minute l was.
Lt'll be that shack on the left.
What a place.
Yeah.
Well, might as well relax till dark.
Nitroglycerine!
Oon't!
You got five minutes.
Get goin'.
That you, Frenchy?
- Yeah.
What's up? - You want a cup of coffee.
- L want a cup of coffee.
Me too.
Just leave it, right there.
Sure you know what you're doin'?
That's far enough.
You two get over in the corner.
Now, Shack, get rid of that gun.
What are you doin' here?
Just visitin'.
And l've gotta give you credit.
- For what?
For your good taste.
You haven't changed a thing.
What do you want?
- My belongings.
Everything in here belongs to me.
- L want my clothes.
L burned them.
- Even those upstairs in the trunk?
There's nothin' up there except...
- Why don't you go get it?
We'll wait here.
- Oo what the man says.
Just exactly!
Yes, sir.
Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
L'm comfortable.
Well?
Yeah.
Careful!
Ooes it always smoke like that?
- Huh?
Ooes it always smoke like that?
Yeah.
These what you mean?
- That's it.
You'd risk your neck for those rags?
- Whose neck?
We've got two minutes.
Get going.
Thanks for your hospitality.
- Glad you got what you came for.
So am l.
Oon't anybody get too anxious to go out this door.
Well, don't stand there, go get him.
Yes, Sir. Come on!
Bunkhouse! Lt's Taw Jackson. Get him!
Where are they goin'?
- Pierce has run 'em out.
All except Wild Horse.
Bring her on out!
That's really something, Mr Pierce.
- She's practically heavy artillery.
Alright, load her up and let's go.
- Yes, sir.
Load her up!
Everything set with Wild Horse?
- He's on his way.
Lt's that time.
Come on!
- Yeah.
Hold it steady.
- L'm tryin'.
How hot's it get around here?
- Ninety, ninety-five. Sometimes more.
You better get me a canteen, then, so as l can water them down a little.
Yeah.
You need any more help?
- L can rig the twine.
L'll just wet 'em down once more.
- L'll see ya later.
L got it.
Lt's the next ravine, Wes.
- Right.
We're running a little late.
- Lt's that extra weight, Mr Pierce.
How's it going?
- L'll be ready.
What's that?
- The Kiowa tribe.
Pierce has got 'em beat.
Look's like
Wild Horse's men are ready.
You think he's gonna fall for that old dust routine?
You better hope so.
You got 100,000 ridin' on it.
Mr Pierce! - Yeah?
- We're bein' followed.
Looks like the whole Kiowa tribe.
Have the riders drop back!
Everybody pull back!
Hold it!
Let's get back to the wagon.
Well.
- Yeah.
What's goin' on back there?
- L don't know, Mr Pierce.
Looks like the boys are comin' back.
Lndians don't blow up bridges.
Knock on it!
There's a crossing upriver.
- That's three miles away.
We got no choice. Let's go.
Mr Pierce! Look!
Gimme a hand here.
That oughta hold 'em.
Let's go.
We're goin' the wrong way.
Here they come.
We're on the wrong road.
What the hell...
Let's get out of here!
- You're guarding this gold. - Not me!
He's right, Mr Pierce.
- You too?
L'm gonna dump it in this gulch!
Jump!
Look like you'll get your ranch back.
Get those barrel tops off.
That looks mighty pretty.
Give me a hand.
That's the last of it.
Well, get goin'. Take it easy.
Taw!
He says to keep away from our guns.
Oirty, double-crossin'...
You leave that be!
Know what you're always sayin'?
Lf we're gonna die, let's have one last drink.
Ls that...?
- Yep!
After you, Taw.
Oon't mind if l do.
Get that wagon!
Lndian expert!
Why didn't you stop them?
How do l go about that?
Taw's right. They'll fight you.
Shut up, lndian!
- L know my people.
To them it's flour.
- What about the gold?
Lt's just food.
- Great!
L'm out 100,000, and 2,000 from Levi.
Where are you goin'?
Back to my people.
What am l supposed to do?
Open up a bakery?
With Pierce dead, it don't even pay to kill you any more.
You owe me 100 a day and 500 when l used my gun. That's $1,200.
Now?
- Now!
L haven't got that kind of money.
All l own is standing right there.
L'll take it.
- My horse? - You're damn right.
You'd leave me out here without a horse? Penniless?
That's your problem, partner.
What happened? - Well, we lost part of it. Toss me those saddlebags.
We'll still meet... in six months and divide it.
But you'll need something to live on.
Be careful where you spend it.
- We will.
Thanks, Taw.
When you catch up with Lomax, tell him where you got it.
He's gonna be mad.
- Yeah.
How much? And what did you do with it?
- 100,000. l hid it. - Where?
L'll tell you in about six months.
- Six months!
L want it now.
- Lt wouldn't be very smart to start flashing gold dust around right after a robbery, would it?
What am l supposed to do till then?
- Well... for one thing, you better make damn sure l stay alive.
Thats a 24-hour-a-day job.
- That's your problem, partner.
- What on earth is he doing?
- Iùs called bulldogging, ma'am.
Thaùs Bulldog Burnett.
He works for my outfit.
Iùs a perfectly silly way to handle cattle, if you ask me.
My name is Charles Ellsworth.
I can tell by your speech that you're from England.
May I ask what has brought you to our fair shore?
- A ship.
- Hilary.
We brought some cattle over.
We're from Herefordshire.
If you'll excuse us, please.
Come along, Hilary.
I know a countryman of yours.
John Taylor. You should meet him.
He has a spread next to ours.
He bested you again, Simons.
Them critters Burnett draws... lay down and roll over when they see him coming.
Being's as how I probably bulldogged their pas... they know what to expect.
SAM: You're next, Sagamon.
SAGAMON: Right.
GERT: Sam. Look who's here.
Jeff, how are you? Hi, Gert.
Jeff, iùs been a long time.
More than a year since he caught that horn.
But I ain't through punching cows yet.
Not by a long shot.
Taylor said he took care of things.
He promised a lot of things.
All Jeff got was $40 and a ticket to St. Louis.
Formerly of England, and now from Texas, Mr. John Taylor.
How do you do?
Mr. Ellsworth tells me you brought these Herefords over.
If Mr. Evans is about,
I'd like to talk to him about them.
My husband was killed in an accident aboard ship.
I'm deeply sorry, ma'am.
But iùs indeed a blessing to find someone at last who knows Herefords.
MARTHA: They were bid in yesterday.
HILARY: By a dairy farmer.
What we were paid hardly covered our transportation.
MARTHA: Leùs show them
Vindicator, Hilary.
Iùs all right.
Vindicator's really very gentle.
My daughter has a special affection for Vindicator. She raised him.
Are you going to sell that bull, Mrs. Evans?
I'm afraid I must.
We need the money.
He'll be auctioned at noon today.
You won't find much market for that muley bull here.
Muley?
Why, your bull has no horns.
He's a freak in that respect.
Mr. Ellsworth, Vindicator's lack of horns is a product of breeding... and it is not a freak condition.
Please, ladies, I didn't intend to start an argument.
My partner Alex Bowen raises the cattle and ships to me.
I'm in the packing end of the game.
I see. A butcher.
Hilary, please.
One morning you'll wake up to a train whistle... and there won't be any more cattle drives.
Yes, sir, in a few years iùll all be gone.
Leastwise, the way we knew it.
Don't start faulting what you can't stand up to, Harter... just 'cause you're finished.
I've still got a hoot and a holler left in me.
Sure. If somebody buys you a bottle.
SAM: Now wait a minute, Simons.
Here's a man that broke most of the trails you're riding today.
Man?
All I see is a deadbeat on crutches.
She's no better.
Watch your wallets, men.
She'll put the bite on you for sure.
Close the gate.
- Mabry, get in there and stop them.
- Yes, sir.
Can't somebody put a stop to this?
Iùs all right, ma'am,
I'll protect you.
Don't you worry about that bull.
I'll see that you get a good price.
Here, get off my bull.
Excuse me, ma'am.
- Our bull is loose.
- Don't worry, ma'am, I'll get him.
MAN: Missed the horns, Burnett.
WOMAN #1: Slipped out from under him.
WOMAN #2: He tried to dog a muley.
SAM: Look out, miss, he's headed this way.
Come on. Up you go.
You're the one that has to be looked out for.
What kind of a bull is that?
Thank you, Mr. Burnett.
You all right, Sam?
Thanks, Gert.
You can't bulldog a bull that doesn't have any horns.
I didn't break anything, just chipped my pride, I guess.
That seems to hurt worse than anything, don't it, Sam?
I'll kill Burnett.
From now on, Mabry here is top hand.
You'll take orders from him.
You'll notice the hornless condition being an innovation... that should meet with the approval of each and every one... who must move or ship cattle.
Mother, if that butcher bids,
I'll die.
Now, really, Hilary you must learn to trust people more.
I had a long talk with Mr. Ellsworth... and he assured me that he'll be bidding for his partner in Texas.
Mr. Bowen is extremely interested in improving his stock.
Now, who will start the bidding?
AUCTIONEER: $700 is bid by Mr. Charles Ellsworth.
$800 by Mr. John Taylor.
$900 for the lovely ladies from England.
If she'd had an elephant up there...
Ellsworth would have bid on that, too.
TAYLOR: $1,000.
- $1,000 from Taylor of Texas.
Don't go away, Sam,
I've got a job for you.
Bowen doesn't want that muley bull.
$1,100 from Mr. Ellsworth on behalf of Mr. Alex Bowen of Texas.
AUCTIONEER: $1,500 from that...
SAM: Have you lost your mind?
ELLSWORTH: $2,000.
AUCTIONEER: $2,000 is bid.
$2,000 once, $2,000 twice.
Sold to Mr. Charles Ellsworth for $2,000.
God save our gracious queen
AUCTIONEER: If you will kindly step forward... for your signatures on the bill of sale.
Get that bull on the Dodge City train tonight and get it to Bowen.
I'm not taking that knob head anywhere.
I'm working for Bowen, not you.
You won't be working for anyone if you keep talking.
That suits me just fine.
You get yourself another man.
I quit.
There goes Bulldog Burnett.
Just a cowpoke, miss.
Long on muscle, short on brains.
I'll get a good hand to take Vindicator west.
You can depend on that.
I'm sure I can, Mr. Ellsworth.
Suppose you drop round the hotel this afternoon... and pick up your money.
I'm in Room 22.
I've got a business deal for you.
Same kind of deal you handed Jeff Harter?
I'll give you $500 for that bull.
Iùs not mine to sell.
Bowen doesn't want it and neither does Ellsworth.
But I do, and I'm willing to pay for it.
Ellsworth paid $2,000 for it.
I'm buying a bull, not female companionship.
All right, I'll go $1,000.
I'll have Mabry and Simons take the noon train to Dodge... and meet you there tomorrow.
All right, I'll deliver it.
Coming, dear lady.
What in thunder do you want, Burnett?
ELLSWORTH: You quit.
SAM: I want to talk to you about that.
Well, get to it.
I've decided to deliver that bull to Bowen.
All right, fine.
You get it out of town and don't bother me about it anymore.
Now look, Sam, be short, be polite, and then be on your way.
Welcome.
Mr. Burnett is just leaving to put Vindicator on the train.
Have a good trip, Sam.
MARTHA: Then you've changed your opinion about Vindicator?
Well, no, ma'am.
I just thought I'd enjoy the trip hearing them cattlemen laugh... about that animal all the way to Dodge.
I'm sure Mr. Bowen won't laugh.
That bull is a thing that might tickle him a good deal.
ELLSWORTH: Give my regards to Bowen.
Have a good trip.
And now, my dear Mrs. Evans... shall we conclude our little business?
This calls for champagne.
Meatpacking Romeo.
When that $2,000 is gone,
Martha, you can tap me for more.
I'm going to lay St. Louis at your feet.
I'm afraid there won't be time for that.
You see, Hilary and I are leaving for England tonight.
ELLSWORTH: But you can't be serious.
I can do a lot for you.
I already have.
Mr. Ellsworth,
I realise that a woman alone... has to expect some nonsense from the adventurous male... but I sold you a Hereford bull, nothing more.
I buy beef for 10 cents a pound.
I know companionship comes higher.
I'm giving you your money back.
There is no sale.
Iùs too late for that.
I'm the legal owner of that bull.
You said that Vindicator would be delivered to your partner.
That was the condition of the sale.
You run out on me, and your bull will end up...
- on that table tomorrow night.
- He will not.
Vindicator will be used for breeding in Texas. I shall see to that.
Iùs getting around train time.
I still have to load that darn bull.
- It might take a little doing.
- Sure would.
Here's a kind of a mash note.
Don't let Jeff read it. I always did try and steal his girl.
I'll see you next year.
Mash note?
Why, Sam was always so woman-shy... it took a team just to drag him into a dance.
Come on, you big, red, no-horned brute, get up.
Hello, Mr. Burnett.
- Here now, there's been a mistake.
- A mistake?
You're not supposed to be...
You're on the wrong train.
- Iùs going to Dodge City, isn't it?
- Yes, iùs going...
Then we're on the right train,
Mr. Burnett.
We're going to the Bowen Ranch with you and Vindicator.
Well, thaùs just about as crazy an idea... as you walking all the way up here on top of this train.
You just did that, didn't you?
How are you getting along with Vindicator?
I'm not getting along with him at all.
He's a useless hunk of gristle, and besides, he's lying on my blankets.
Vindicator is not useless.
He'll certainly improve those scrubby old longhorns of yours.
Why, he's so handsome, the cows will fight to present themselves to him.
Now, what kind of talk is that?
What kind of a thing is that for a young lady to say?
The facts of life are no mystery to me, Mr. Burnett.
After all,
I am a cattle breeder's daughter.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
My father taught me to talk about such things.
Bloodlines and breeding were decent topics in our house.
Nobody said anything about your father.
I was just... Whaùs the idea, crashing in here on me like this?
There's nothing sacred about a cattle car.
This one happens to be my bedroom.
And you have not been invited in here.
Now, come on, you bison belly,
I'm gonna teach you how to behave.
Come on, get up.
Don't you dare kick a helpless animal.
And Vindicator doesn't appreciate name-calling, either.
You mean I've hurt his feelings?
HILARY: I mean Vindicator's lineage... is traceable back to James I.
Which is a great deal better than you can do, I'm sure.
Why, he's practically royalty.
And you might as well learn how to handle him properly.
Listen to me, if you please.
There you are.
Now you may try it, Mr. Burnett.
- God Save the Queen.
- Now, hold on.
I have my rights.
I'm not gonna whistle a tune for any royal, James I, muley bull.
Now, you get back up this ladder here.
SAM: I'll help you.
- I don't need your help, thank you.
The female is no less agile than the male.
Thaùs right, young lady. Goodbye.
Holy Moses.
Come on, get down off here, before you fall and break your neck.
Careful now.
- Mrs. Evans, your berths are ready.
MARTHA: Thank you.
There's Mr. Burnett.
Run along to bed, Hilary.
I want to have a talk with Mr. Burnett.
You're wasting your time, Mother.
He's obstinate, ill-tempered, and quite lacking in education.
Perhaps. But he does have a rough intelligence... which could be refined, don't you think?
Don't be long, Mother.
Now, really, Mr. Burnett,
I don't bite.
- Man overboard.
- Hold it, ma'am.
Mr. Burnett, I am sorry.
But I thought you'd fallen over the railing.
No, ma'am.
I might jump, I'd never fall.
Of course.
Now, Mr. Burnett, since we're travelling together...
I see no point in our avoiding each other.
- There are many arrangements...
- Firstly... we're not travelling together.
We're just on the same train.
And if I was you, I'd get off.
I intend to deliver Vindicator personally to Mr. Bowen.
I'm doing that for Ellsworth, and you don't figure in it at all.
Now, my advice to you is to get the first train back to St. Louis... and then get on home, where you belong.
Mr. Burnett, you may bulldog a steer... but you cannot bulldog me.
Vindicator represents generations of selective breeding... and I intend to see he's properly placed.
Now, please, ma'am.
I've had all the breeding
I can take for one day.
The thing I'm trying to get over to you is that this trip's dangerous.
There's no telling what might happen to you in Dodge.
Surely our lives will be safe in your hands.
I don't want your lives in my hands.
I've got enough trouble with my own.
The thing for you to do is turn back at Dodge... and trust me to deliver that bull of yours.
Mr. Burnett, you will either act as our guide to the Bowen Ranch... or I will get someone else.
Good night, sir.
Would you get our baggage, please?
- Is there something wrong?
- Why, no, ma'am.
SIMONS: Come on, you stupid...
You fellows are gonna wreck this whole deal.
You don't know these two women
I've got on my neck.
They're bound and determined to come with me the whole way to Bowen's.
They got paid $2,000 for this bull, so they're out of it. Come on.
You horn in now, they'll call the Sheriff.
SIMONS: You horn in, I'll call him.
You made a deal with Taylor.
Now hold on, both of you.
This whole thing is shady all the way around.
All I want is the bull.
And you'll get it.
I'll meet you over at the saloon.
We'll work something out.
All right. Come on, Simons.
All right. But don't make me have to come looking for you, Burnett.
Give me 20 minutes, I'll be there.
Now, come on, you, move.
You muley, red rump roast. Come on.
HILARY: All you have to do is whistle,
Mr. Burnett.
SAM: What are you doing here?
HILARY: I thought you might need help.
But I see you've had some.
Why, thaùs excellent, Mr. Burnett.
You've learned to handle him very well.
Vindicator, you're a fickle-hearted muley bull.
I'm afraid Hilary is jealous,
Mr. Burnett.
How soon can we be on our way?
I've got to get a wagon and all sorts of supplies and horses.
Yes, of course.
But that won't take very long.
I've asked the baggage man to take our things to the hotel.
So we'll wait there for you.
Ma'am, I don't think you ought to be so dead set on this trip.
But I am dead set.
So leùs not waste the day in talk.
HILARY: One of them say it was a shady deal all round.
- Mother, you haven't been listening.
- Of course I have, dear.
HILARY: We should go to the Sheriff... and have Mr. Burnett thrown into the hoosegow.
- The what?
- The jail, jug, old Bailey.
Why on earth should we do a thing like that?
Because they plan to kidnap Vindicator... and Mr. Burnett is in cahoots with them.
What is this cahoots?
It sounds awful.
Conspiracy. Anyway, he said he'd meet them in the pub.
It has something to do with that Mr. Taylor.
Hilary, Mr. Taylor is an Englishman.
So was Captain Kidd. Come on.
If we can find them, I'll show you.
SAM: Wait a minute, Simons, you go out on that street... and we'll all go to jail.
Give us another drink.
I don't want your whisky.
Come on, Mabry.
I'm not letting those women ride away with that bull.
We're going straight through
Taylor's place.
I'll stake that bull out at Sand Creek.
You come in at night and take him,
I'll say he strayed off.
You're just gonna stir things up here.
You bet I am.
You two women go over to the wagon.
I've got a little business to attend to here.
I'll be with you directly.
Does that look like a conspiracy to you?
The thieves have fallen out.
I'm giving the orders here, Simons.
I said, quit it.
Just look at that.
Those ruffians.
Stop this at once.
This is too much. Drop that gun.
How dare you hit that man.
He was gonna shoot me.
Now, really, Mr. Burnett, you have a predisposition to violence...
- of which I heartily disapprove.
- Yes, ma'am.
Now, leùs be on our way before you cause more trouble.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Come along, Hilary.
SAM: Excuse me, ma'am,
 you're on my hat.
I see what you're up against, all right.
Sand Creek, day after tomorrow.
And that bull better be there.
Very well, Mr. Burnett, if you are ready.
That horse is a little hard to handle, ma'am.
If you can't ride, maybe you'd better stay here.
We have ridden on occasion,
Mr. Burnett.
Haven't we, Hilary?
Just one thing, ma'am... if you're dead set on making this trip to Texas... you're going the wrong way.
Thank you, Mr. Burnett.
- You are a very capable guide.
- I can tell north from south.
Now, if you'll just...
SAM: Where you been, ma'am?
I was about to go out and look for you.
The only thing I concede is that you had the better horse.
SAM: We'll swap off and do it again.
Thank you, Sam.
Hilary, would you like to ride a little while?
No, thank you, Mother.
I'll just drive along... just drive while you two consort.
Really, Hilary, do you call an innocent canter consorting?
No, but I call a half-a-day gallop a romp.
- What do you think now, Mr. Burnett, of Vindicator's ability to travel?
He's doing all right.
As well as a longhorn, would you say?
Iùs hard to say.
In winter, the cattle have to travel a good bit looking for feed... and in summers, every once in a while there's a drought.
A few wells and catch basins would solve that problem.
Alex Bowen's not gonna change... the countryside to accommodate one bull.
Mr. Bowen cannot stop progress.
One day this whole range... will be occupied by white-faced Hereford cattle.
You'll see it happen.
SAM: I hung onto his horns, and that fool steer ran a mile... me flapping like laundry in a high wind.
Finally, he stopped, and looked at me real sorrowful... and then he just flopped down, disgusted.
And you were only 16?
And from that time on, they took to calling me Bulldog.
From what I saw, things don't seem to have changed very much.
Here, I'll get you some more coffee.
- You all right?
- Yes, and you?
If anyone's interested,
Vindicator and I are all right, too.
Musùve been a stray shot.
Funny that a stray shot should just happen to hit our coffee pot.
Now, Miss Hilary, don't start dreaming up any more trouble.
I think we'd better all turn in.
Got to be up before daybreak.
Come on.
I'll take care of Vindicator.
Did you fire that shot?
I was just reminding Burnett to show up at Sand Creek.
I told you once, and I'm telling you again...
I'll handle this.
Mabry, out here you ain't telling me nothing.
HILARY: There's your saddle.
- Thank you. Your mother up?
- No.
I just thought I'd help you on your way.
Whaùs gotten into you now?
Come now.
That shot was a signal from Taylor's men.
You're taking Vindicator to them.
Go on, and good riddance.
You're dead wrong.
I was just gonna get you up.
HILARY: I just bet you were.
I was and I am.
Time to get up, ma'am.
Come on, roust out.
HILARY: If you have any decency,
 you'll go.
Vindicator will be better off with Taylor... and my mother can certainly do without you.
- Hilary. What on earth...
- I know what you're up to.
You've decided to play
Mr. Ellsworth's game.
Mr. Burnett is just like him.
- He certainly is not like him.
- No?
One was willing to buy a bull he didn't want... the other to sell one he didn't own.
Iùs just the same.
Only this time, you don't care.
You can't see it because you don't want to.
Sam, is there any truth in this?
Mother, I know what I heard.
I'm just telling you
I got up to get an early start.
What you heard in Dodge doesn't have anything to do with us.
You're calling me a liar.
I'm just saying that you misunderstood something... and imagined more.
I suppose I only imagine... that you're trying to win my mother's affections?
Hilary, that question is most certainly not to the point.
Iùs the whole point, Mother.
And Mr. Burnett knows it.
Vindicator is going to be delivered to Alex Bowen.
And the sooner we move, the sooner we'll get there.
Very well, Sam. Leùs move.
SAM: All right, hold up.
Give me the axe behind the seat.
Wire.
They'll wire the whole world.
Telegraph wire... barbed wire.
This must be private property.
There's always been free passage across this range.
Taylor may own these sections, he's got no right to wire them.
Do you mean that we're going onto Taylor's ranch?
We're leaving it.
All right, Martha, bring the wagon through.
SAM: Leùs make time.
MARTHA: Are you satisfied now, Hilary?
I am.
They ought to be moving into Bosquo Canyon about now.
Burnett had no intention of stopping at Sand Creek.
We better go tell Taylor.
SIMONS: You're all through telling,
 Mabry.
There's $3,000 waiting for me in that canyon.
Iùll get me all the way to Mexico.
You're getting off right here.
You're crazy, Simons.
Put that gun away.
Start running.
- Mother.
- Yes?
- May I ride with you for a bit?
- Of course, dear.
SAM: Better keep moving along.
Few more miles and we'll be out of this.
Cattle up in there.
MARTHA: Whaùs that noise?
SAM: Horns.
Horns?
Cattle horns.
I'll be right back, you follow along slow.
- Hi, Jamie.
- Hi, Sam.
- Where are you moving the stock?
- To Dodge.
I'm gonna cash them in and be my own boss.
Bowen know about this?
Pa might miss the cattle but he won't miss me.
I figure he owes me something for my time.
You all alone?
No, Felipe's back there pushing the drag.
Don't crowd them too much.
- I got some people up ahead here.
- Right.
Swing out! They're moving!
Come on.
Turn that wagon around.
Stay where you are. Get back.
Drop your gun right there.
Now I'll take the money
Taylor paid you for the bull.
I haven't got it.
I'll search your corpse if thaùs the way you want it.
There'll be no need for that.
I'll give you the money.
How much were you paid for Vindicator, Mr. Burnett?
SIMONS: $1,000.
I'll take all the money.
What else you got in there?
Stop it. Do you hear me? Stop it!
No wonder there's nothing out here.
You're all too busy killing each other.
Now, Mr. Simons,
I came by my $2,000 honestly... so you will please give them back to me.
And then get out of here.
Look out, Martha, he's still got a gun.
So have I.
No, please. Let him go.
I don't want any killing.
SIMONS: Come on. Get up.
- You killed him.
- He didn't give me any choice.
A man is dead, and this boy is hurt.
All because of your dishonesty.
Thaùs one way to see it, ma'am.
Out. There's the answer.
Take whaùs due and skin out.
HILARY: Mother, can't we stop?
It isn't much farther, dear... and there'll be people there to look after him.
- You'll be home soon.
- Home?
No. Where's my hat?
Estaban. Juan.
Get Jamie inside, he's hurt.
Please, lift him carefully.
Here's Jamie, Alex. He's hurt.
Aye, it doesn't surprise me.
Felipe comes stumbling in... this afternoon with a hole in his shoulder.
Stampede, he says.
MARTHA: Do you mean you knew your son was in danger and didn't send help?
Madam, I knew he'd either make it back alive or he would not.
In this part of the world, a helping hand comes too late.
Now, what do you want?
What do I want?
Now, you listen to me.
Your son is hurt.
And I want him moved to a warm room.
And then bring me some bandages.
You shut your gob, woman.
Out here iùs Alexander Bowen what gives the orders... and you womenfolk listen to what I say. Is that clear to you?
You pompous, foul-smelling tyrant.
I want that boy moved where he can be looked after.
Now, you and you there. Pick him up.
And, Mr. Burnett, you can certainly help.
Don't just stand there.
Do as she says.
He's got a busted arm... a bunch of cracked ribs,
I don't know what else.
All we can do under these primitive conditions... is to keep him down and hope.
I'm sorry about the place.
I'll need something for that roof to keep the weather out.
I've taken care of that.
You have?
I told that Estaban to fix...
Undisciplined and shiftless, the whole lot of them.
Yes, but we don't know that about Jamie, do we?
You need this, seÒora?
No, not in here. Up on the roof.
I don't want to catch the rain,
I want to keep it out.
And pass the information on to those who ought to know... that cleanliness is next to godliness.
No, we don't know about Jamie at all.
Will they be gone very long?
Maybe four, five days, maybe more.
There is much work to do.
There certainly is.
That woman has taken over my fort.
Right there.
The entire place stinks of laundry soap.
Madam, if you do not care to get snowed in...
I suggest that you hitch up your wagon and head for Dodge.
I don't intend to head for anywhere until Jamie recovers.
I'm glad to hear it.
He's feeling better if you care to know.
And furthermore, we can't leave... until you understand how to take care of Vindicator.
Now, tomorrow, I would like to go out and select some cows.
- Select?
- Yes, for breeding purposes.
Madam, out here iùs the fit that survive... and if that creature of yours cannot select his own cows... he is not fit to live here.
I think it may be a good idea if you take a wee peek... at some of these prospective brides... you're figuring to match up with that Hereford of yours.
- Thaùs precisely my intention.
- Good.
You come on the morrow... and I'll hunt up a longhorn cow for you... and then you'll see for yourself why I think that bull of yours... will not be the father of a calf.
It won't be exactly the kind of a hunt you'd expect, ma'am.
- Here, can I help with this?
- No, thank you, Mr. Burnett.
They're clean.
I'd like to keep them that way.
- Beef stew?
- Chicken broth.
Snake broth, gopher broth, anything but chicken broth.
When do I get to eat?
- I can do that.
- Do it then.
- Sure would like something to chew.
- Chew the spoon.
Hey, you're touchy this morning.
Your father's back.
He goes off for a whole week without saying goodbye... then doesn't even stop in to see how you are.
Whaùs between you two?
You snarl and growl at each other like two wounded animals.
Iùs always been like that.
- But why?
- Hilary, don't get involved.
Don't get involved?
Jamie Bowen, if you didn't have enough broken bones...
I'd certainly add to your collection.
I'm surrounded by stubbornness.
Sam, Mother, your father, and now you.
The only one I can talk to around here is Vindicator.
I hate family mysteries.
Why does it have to be that way?
I don't know!
If I knew, I'd tell you, but I don't.
- I'm sorry.
- Thaùs all right.
You're gonna stay around until I'm back on my feet again, aren't you?
Maybe even a little longer.
Hilary, we're going out to select some cows tomorrow.
Jamie, how are you?
Fine, Mrs. Evans.
I just had the best chicken broth you ever tasted.
But if you find a loose cow and could slip it past Hilary...
I'd eat it horns, hooves, hide, everything.
BOWEN: You still think that bull of yours could be her mate?
Mr. Bowen, Vindicator's first calves... will weigh half again as much as your longhorn calves... and they'll be hardy.
She can rip him to tatters while he's still dancing.
- He'll never beget a calf.
- You're mistaken.
BOWEN: Madam, I've lived half my life here.
And I tell you, if the longhorns do not kill him... then the wolves and the winters will.
And I suppose you agree with him?
Sometimes it gets down to 20 below, ma'am.
You can see that beast, Mother.
A cow? Good Lord!
I believe that Vindicator will live long enough... on the open range to reproduce.
And thaùs all we can expect of him.
Mother, thaùs cruel.
Yes, iùs cruel, and stupid, and savage.
But then we live among savage and stupid people.
And the only way to convince them is on their own terms.
Survival.
Thaùs all they understand.
We could build a shelter.
Keep him alive that way.
I can keep roses alive in a hothouse.
And you've got a hothouse bull, madam.
Thaùs not so.
Vindicator does have stamina and fighting spirit. He does.
My father bred it into him... and if he has to risk his life to prove it to you, then he will.
She'll not turn him loose after what she's seen here.
Yes, she will.
You forget that my husband died... trying to bring Herefords here and prove this very point.
That woman does not fear a thing, eh, Sam?
Nothing but dishonesty and dirt.
Do you think your ma has any cold beef in the cupboard?
- Sure, Jamie.
- And my ma has tortillas.
Get out of sight! And, Conchita, come back later with tortillas.
- All right, Vindicator. Come on.
Jamie, you shouldn't be out here.
I like to see open sky once in a while.
Where you taking Rosy Red?
- Don't call him that.
- I'm sorry, Hilary.
I'm taking him out, far out on the range... and I'm going to leave him there.
There's no point in getting yourself all upset over an old bull.
Vindicator isn't old.
Well, I mean, he's an animal not a person.
You are a Bowen, yes, you are.
Insensitive and hateful.
You don't even know what this means to me.
You can't understand it and you never will.
Come on, Vindicator.
You go along now, Vindicator... and don't you come back, do you hear me?
Go along.
Vindicator, you've got to stand on your own four feet. I mean it.
You're a British bull with uncommon good sense... and fine ancestors.
We've had some fine times together.
Now you've got to prove yourself.
And prove that Father was right.
Go on.
She turned him loose.
Your lass has got guts,
I'll grant you that.
I suppose you'll be going home now, ma'am?
What for?
I mean, whaùs the rush, Sam?
Mistress Evans could pay us a wee visit for awhile.
Come summer, you'll see the first crossbred Herefords on this range.
Sam, there's no sense in telling her a lie.
This is longhorn country... and iùll stay longhorn country, madam, you cannot change it.
I meant what I said.
If only I could believe that,
Mr. Burnett... it might make a difference.
But I made that mistake once, didn't I?
Martha, what I did was wrong.
I lied to you because I didn't want you and Hilary to turn against me... and I'm sorry.
I think I'd better go to Hilary.
Then you're not still mad at me?
No, not particularly.
You know, Jamie... there's really nothing to keep us here anymore, is there?
Vindicator's out there on the range...
- and you're up and around.
- No, now, wait a minute.
I've still got cracked ribs and they hurt like the devil.
Here, I'll show you.
See? Thaùs painful.
I need attention.
Jamie, you're breaking my ribs.
Yeah.
And I will, too, if thaùs what iùs gonna take to keep you here.
Look, all I've got is the two legs
I stand on, Hilary... but there's room in this country to make us a place like Herefordshire.
I don't care what iùs like.
I don't ever want to leave you.
BOWEN: I'll take the low road
I'll be in Scotland afore ye
Come on!
Get on, will you?
I don't need witnesses.
Get out of here! Go, will you?
Don't just stand there, man, slam the door!
SAM: Whaùre you doing?
BOWEN: What does it look like?
You look like a bull in a mud wallow.
Look, we got a blizzard on our hands out there.
- The glass is still dropping.
- Thaùs grand.
She'll not be able to travel in such weather.
Been wondering how to keep her here short of violence.
How do I smell, Sam?
Do I smell grand now?
- You smell like an old buffalo.
- Thaùs not me, thaùs the robe.
Alex, I'm going out and find Vindicator... and bring him back here until this weather lets up.
- Let nature take its course, man.
- But I can save him.
BOWEN: Who wants to save him?
After he's no more here...
Mistress Evans will see that I was right about this place... and then she may get a wee glimmer... that I can be right about some other things.
Well, it doesn't take any brains to let a bull die in a blizzard.
Aye, but it takes a great deal to turn loose of the past... and thaùs exactly what I want her to do.
I want her to forget all about
Herefords, and think about me.
I made up my mind.
I'm going to wed that woman.
- You're going to wed her?
- Aye.
But, Bowen, Mrs. Evans is a lady.
She's an English lady.
She didn't come all the way out here... to marry an old grizzly bear like you.
BOWEN: Yeah, she will, I tell you.
Once that bull is dead and gone, she'll turn her attention to me:
Alexander Bowen!
Every laddie has his lassie
And all the girls they smile at me
Coming through the rye
SAM: Anything?
JUAN: That bull has vanished, seÒor.
If he's smart like you say... he headed for the Gulf of Mexico last week.
A man cannot find a thing in this snow.
Listen close. Listen.
You try it.
Keep it up loud.
We'll make another swing.
Sam, tomorrow I'm going with you.
No, you're not well enough.
I've been doing cartwheels for weeks.
Hilary and Mrs. Evans are worried half to death about you.
SAM: Iùs your job to stop their worrying.
Come on, leùs get in out of the cold.
CHILDREN: Save her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign
over us
God save the queen
Mistress Evans.
I'm serving tea at about 4:00 this afternoon.
- I wondered if you'd care to come?
- Tea?
Why, thank you very much, Mr. Bowen.
It could be a nice change for you.
At 4:00, then.
All right, children. Stand up now.
We're going to sing America.
One, two, three.
My country, 'tis of thee
Miss Evans, good day to you.
Up and about, are you?
Do you feel sprightly enough to run off again?
I'm through running.
I'm going to find me my own place.
That sounds easy when you say it, but iùs not.
Life out here is hard, laddie.
Yeah, well, don't do anything to make it any softer.
What are you referring to?
Like maybe you could build some sheds for the stock... and lay in some winter feed and repair this godforsaken place?
You've been listening to that wee lassie.
You bet.
And iùs the first sense I've heard in all this part of Texas.
I'm serving tea at 4:00 this afternoon.
You may bring Miss Evans if you care to.
The master will join you presently.
My, aren't we formal.
A Highland officer?
91st Argyle. Foot.
You do not recognise me in uniform, do you, Jamie?
No, you couldn't.
You were only a wee lad then.
Iùs the first time I've scraped my face since I left my regiment.
Would you care to pour, Mrs. Evans?
Estaban has made us some scones.
He's quite a good cook.
Estaban, you scoundrel.
I thought you were 100 years older than Sam.
Approve of the change, do you?
The trouble with appearances,
Mr. Bowen... is while beauty is skin deep... meanness runs all the way through.
Whaùs that you're saying?
She's saying that bagpipes and tea... don't erase the way you've treated Jamie.
I did the best I could, lassie.
And I could not help it if he did not have a mother's tender care.
All these years you've hardly ever spoken to him.
It does not suit my purpose to discuss the past.
- You mean my mother?
- Aye.
Now, what could I have said to you, Jamie?
She was ailing when you were born... and she died.
And all the words in the world cannot bring her back... or your husband.
Mistress Evans... you've captured my entire fort and all of its inhabitants.
You've got them eating out of your wee hand.
Aye, iùs true.
Now you've made attachments here yourself, dear lady.
To Jamie and to the schoolchildren...
I just wish... I mean...
I've been hoping that you could find it in your heart to... make a similar attachment to me.
Given a wee while, of course.
I wouldn't want to rush you.
And I want you to think about making your home here in Texas.
You and your lassie.
She likes it here by the looks of things.
What I'm trying to say... is that could be such a grand life for us all.
It would never be like Herefordshire.
Aye, and iùs not like Scotland, either.
But when I first came here,
I made up my mind...
I was going to accept the land as I found it.
Thaùs what you must do because you cannot change it.
And if you're still thinking that I'm responsible... because Hereford cattle cannot adapt themselves to Texas... and that I shattered... that lovely dream you shared with your husband, thaùs not true.
You cannot live with dreams.
Iùs time to stop dreaming and live for this day... and the next day.
Time for me to admit that this is longhorn country... and that you're its lord and master.
A man in love is not even lord nor master of himself.
I'd like to change the climate for you, if I could.
What are you looking at, man?
Is that you, SeÒor Bowen?
No, I'm Bonnie Prince ruddy Charlie.
BOWEN: What do you want?
JUAN: I lost touch with him.
BOWEN: With who?
JUAN: SeÒor Burnett.
I could hear him whistling, but he was gone...
I could not find him.
The snow was too heavy.
Is he lost?
No, seÒora, maybe he has troubles...
but SeÒor Burnett is not lost.
Fetch the men. Go on with you.
BOWEN: Saddle my horse.
JAMIE: I'll come, too.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I have been wondering for years... what you were hiding behind that beard of yours.
I told you before, a man can change.
All right, you've changed.
I'm sure Mrs. Evans approves.
Well, I haven't changed.
That Hereford bull's out here somewhere and I'm gonna find him.
Do you think you be fit to travel?
Of course I'm fit...
SAM: Quit shoving. I can walk.
Come over here, Sam.
Hilary, get some coffee.
I don't want you to go out there any more, do you understand?
You think Vindicator's dead, too?
Yes, but that doesn't matter now.
No, I'll do this.
There isn't anything worth the risk you're taking, Sam.
- There isn't?
- No.
This is longhorn country.
Leùs face it and be done with it once and for all.
Well, I'm not done with it.
You planted an idea in me,
Mrs. Evans, and the roots went deep.
I think Vindicator is as good or better than any longhorn alive.
And come summer, there's gonna be crossbreed Herefords on this range.
You just wait and see.
Not on this range.
Just because you shaved and took a bath... don't be so high and mighty about everything.
You don't know Hereford stock.
Sam Burnett, I give you my permission... to clear the range of any crossbreed cows you can find.
Take them. They're yours.
But do not worry us about it anymore.
Iùs not good for Mistress Evans... to hear you constantly dragging up the past.
Besides, I've asked her to wed me.
And she hasn't exactly said no.
Seems to me like you've broken faith... with everything that brought you here.
I've never been a person to avoid facing facts, Mr. Burnett.
And you should know that.
I was wrong about this country.
And I admit it.
Well, then, your husband was wrong about Herefords, too.
Yes. All right, yes!
But there are other things to consider.
There's Hilary and Jamie.
And life must go on.
All right, Alex...
I'll take the crossbreed Herefords I find... and I'll build a place for them.
Sam, don't. Can't you see iùs over?
SAM: Not for me.
Give him a hand.
He's hell-bent for disaster out there.
There's no stopping him.
Jamie, here's Sam.
You're driving them in, huh?
Yeah, a lot of them aren't up to it.
Dad says he can't remember a worse winter.
We haven't seen much of you, Sam.
How have you been?
I'm fine. Fine.
- Building a place.
- Yeah, Juan was telling me.
Juan, he comes out every once in a while, lends a hand.
- I'd like to see it, Sam.
- Not till iùs finished.
I'm working on the calving pens now. Waiting.
I'll be moving along.
Whoa, boy.
Iùs Vindicator, isn't it?
A lot of longhorns died, too.
We knew what to expect, Sam.
Now, I want you to tell Bowen.
You tell him that this doesn't mean there won't be calves.
You tell him that.
You tell them both.
- Hello, Hilary.
- Hello, Sam.
- Juan directed me how to get here.
- Iùs not hard to find.
Jamie knows it.
He's been out here lots of times.
Yes. Jamie and I aren't on very good terms at the moment.
I see.
- Could I talk to you for a bit, Sam?
- Sure.
HILARY: Thank you.
I have some medium-hot coffee in there. Would you like some?
HILARY: Yes, thanks.
Here, I'll let you take the real chair.
HILARY: Thanks.
I'm just finishing up the calf pens.
I built two corrals up in the canyon.
Do you still think there will be calves?
SAM: Yes, I do.
You see, iùs only the end of June.
Vindicator could have lasted longer than anybody expected.
You could see his calves clear into October.
I see.
- What did you say this was, Sam?
- Coffee.
I'm sorry about you and Jamie.
You two have a fight?
Thaùs what
I wanted to talk to you about.
You see, everything's become so complicated.
Iùs just that Jamie asked me to marry him.
SAM: I think thaùs fine.
HILARY: And I said no.
- You don't love him?
- Yes, I do. Very much.
- Well, then...
- But don't you see... if I marry Jamie then Mother will have to marry Mr. Bowen.
No, I'm afraid I don't follow you.
Sam, don't you ever think about Mother?
Think about her?
I think about her all the time.
I have this place here and this idea... and thaùs more than I ever had in my whole life before.
And your mother made this all possible for me.
And it means a lot.
Then, iùs not right for you to keep all these things to yourself.
Iùs not fair. Mother needs you.
I'm afraid I'm not very good at figuring out problems... especially other people's.
All I know is that
I'm tied to this idea here... that your mother gave me, and I'm just bound to go through with it.
But iùll be too late, Sam.
Mother and Mr. Bowen...
No, your mother'll make her own decision.
And thaùs as it should be.
But you ought to make yours, too,
Hilary.
If you love Jamie, I think you ought to go up and tell him.
And marry him.
- Do you think I should?
- I sure do.
Well, thanks for the coffee.
- I'm glad I came to see you.
- I'm glad you did, too.
Come back, Sam.
Iùs a grand day.
Get out of there, you beast, you.
Iùs a grand day, Mistress Evans.
- We've got plans to make.
- How thoughtful of you.
- What I mean to say is that...
- They're lovely.
I mean to say iùs urgent that we make haste.
We ought to be thinking about setting a time.
Very well, Alex. September, then.
Late in September.
You're not still hoping that there'll be some crossbreed calves?
I suppose so.
I can't seem to help myself.
Iùs because that lunatic is still out there searching.
He's bound to fail, I tell you.
You see that, don't you?
Yes, I know. But until September.
- Thaùs not too much to ask, is it?
- No.
He'll certainly give up by then.
I agree. September it is.
I'm gonna borrow him for a little while.
Don't you worry.
Jamie, there's Sam.
You got a whiteface.
This is what you came here for, Martha.
There's Hereford crossbreeds on this range.
That calf will make a fine wedding present, Sam.
I told you I'd be back when I found a crossbreed.
There's the first one.
You take your hand off that woman, Sam Burnett.
And there'll be more whiteface but I'm gonna need you, Martha.
Did you hear what I said?
I said take your hand off her.
And you get out of here.
- Alex, I...
- I can see for myself, woman.
Thaùs Hereford country and you can raise the bloody things.
Raise them if you can, I say.
Thaùs just what we're going to do.
And before we're finished... you're gonna see crossbreed
Hereford all over this range.
You can take that one with you.
That one looks like one of the first dozen, Martha.
I'm glad we kept some longhorns,
Sam, for old times' sake.
So am I.
They're getting pretty scarce.
There. Watch that one now.
Do you still think one of them will come to you?
No, not really.
Sometimes a bit of him catches my eye.
I like to think he's still out there. Somewhere.
English - SDH
He's corny as corn bread seedy as grain
He came out west on a northbound train
The crooks die laughing but they're deadjust the same
He's the shakiest gun in the West
Yeah
He's the shakiest gun in the West
He's got a phony pony that was made in Japan
He rides in the saddle like an elevator man
He's an underfoot tenderfoot king of the mess
He's the shakiest gun in the West
Yeah
He's the shakiest gun in the West
But he stands for right
Both day and night
He may lose the battle for a while
But he'll win the fight
He's a humdinger a western swinger
But he has a little trouble with his trigger finger
When he takes aim it's anybody's guess
He's the shakiest gun in the West
Yeah
He's the shakiest gun in the West
He's a dude done over you can see at a glance
His boots are shiny and so are his pants
He's got hair in his eye and a gleam on his chest
He's the shakiest gun in the West
Yeah
He's the shakiest gun in the West
But he stands for right
Both day and night
He may lose the battle for a while
But he'll win the fight
Yeah, he stands for right
Both day and night
Oh, help.! Help.! Help.!
Help! Ohhh!
Help! Help!
Madam, madam, please be patient.
After all, this is the final examination for these dental students.
It's important that you cooperate.
Now, stay in your chair and try to relax.
Golly Ned, Mother!
Relax. Up we go.
All right.
You just sit down there.
There we go.
All righty, Miss Stevenson.
Now, first things first.
Now we're just gonna take a little look-see at your general dental condition.
Sort of get the lay of the land.
You know? Okay.
All righty, open your mouth.
No, no, you see, if, uh... if you don't open your mouth, then I can't see anything.
See? That's the way that works.
Uh, come on now, Miss Stevenson.
Seriously. Open your mouth.
Open up.
Come on, come on.
I'll help you here. I'll get that... There. Open that...
How're you doing, Heywood? Fine. Fine.
Dr. Friedlander?
What seems to be the trouble, Heywood?
Complete closure of the oral cavity, eh?
She won't open her mouth.
Watch me carefully.
Well, Miss Stevenson, don't we look lovely today.
But we have a toothache, haven't we?
A tooth saved is a silver dollar in the bank of health.
Now, open your mouth, dear.
Op... Open wide.
Are we going to open up that mouth?
Open that rotten little mouth!
You're in my way, Heywood.
You're in my way!
I can't...
I can't get loose.
Wait 'til I get...
Get me out of here!
You're on your own from here on, Heywood.
If you don't get that mouth open and get that tooth fixed, you don't graduate.
Mm-hmm.
Now, Miss Stevenson,
I realize that this is hardly the time or place to bring this up, but, uh, I'd like very much to see you socially sometime.
Oh! Well, I, uh...
There!
Everything going okay, Heywood?
Fine. Uh-huh. Fine.
Mm-hmm.
All right, make way for the mother of a dentist.
The mother ofJesse W. Heywood, valedictorian.
I'm her best friend.
Uh, Dr. Friedlander, faculty, students... and parents.
As we, uh, stand on the threshold...
Louder.! As we stand on the threshold of graduation, we may get the feeling that this is the end.
This is really the beginning...
Louder.!
This is really the beginning... of stepping out into new horizons: north, south, east... and... west.
Speaking of west, that is the direc... that is the direction that I personally am going to.
Why did I choose the West?
Because the West is a place where few, if any, dentists have trod.
So I am going to trod there.
Why, Jesse? Why?
Well, Mom, the West needs dentists.
I mean, teeth are fallin' out right and left out there.
Teeth are falling out in Philadelphia too.
Yeah, but Philadelphia is overrun with dentists. There must be seven!
Gratitude! Gratitude!
Some nice gratitude!
But all the plans, all the nice surprises.
Your Uncle George was going to give you an office over the harness shop... for $3.00 a month.
And Celia's Leonard was going to give you... four rolls of wallpaper.
Blue ducks.
Fifty cents a foot!
Wholesale!
Oh, Jesse!
Jesse, Jesse, Jesse!
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.
If he were mine, I'd know what to do. Put him across my knee.
Butt out!
I'm family!
You're not family!
I'm your aunt!
You're not a real aunt. Just my mother's best friend. Oh, yeah?
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah?
How's it going, Heywood? Fine. Fine.
Those half-naked savages must have colds all the time.
Oh, Ma, that's an old wives' tale.
Your average Indian's the healthiest person in the world.
But, Jesse, dear, it stands to reason... Uh, Ma, Ma, Ma!
Call me "Doctor."
Oh, excuse me, is this car 24?
Uh, all the way down, mack.
Thank you.
But, Doctor, you've always been such a delicate little boy.
You've got such touchy sinuses.
You've always had your father's delicate sinuses.
Aw, Ma!
Now don't "aw" me.
It was your father's sinuses that killed him.
He was run over by a beer wagon!
He was blowing his nose in the middle of the street.
Well, I'm not going to cry.
Good for you, Ma.
I promised myself
I wouldn't cry.
Attagirl.
If you don't believe me, ask Celia.
I said, "Celia, I'm not going to cry at the station."
And you've always kept your word, Ma.
Uh, is this car 24?
Uh, back that way.
Huh. Well...
I'll bet you think
I'm crying right now.
You promised yourself you wouldn't. And I'm not!
That's 'cause you're strong, Ma.
Just think, Ma.
Gettin' ready to head west.
In two days, I'll be in Ohio.
In one week, I'll be in St. Louis.
And in two months,
California!
What an age we live in.
Things are moving too fast.
Excuse me, bunky.
Is this about it?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, Ma...
Oh! Oh, uh...
Ma, you got something for the porter? Got a nickel?
A nickel?
Uh, n-no charge.
Ma, what's that?
Well, it got your Uncle Metcalf safely through the Civil War.
Here, you may need it.
Well, gee, Ma, that's kind of nifty.
Wear it in good health.
Board.!
Well, Ma, I guess this is it.
Good-bye, dear.
Write me as soon as you get to the West.
I will, Ma.
Don't look back, Ma.
Goin' out west, partner?
Sure am, partner.
Naka washa.
Well... thank you, dear lady.
Oh, uh, thank you, dear lady.
Mmm!
That's good!
What is that?
Wana tonka.
Wana tonka?
Lizard roll.
Rest stop! Rest stop!
All right, everybody out of that stage. Come on!
Come on!
Come on, let's go.!
And you up there, throw down that strongbox!
Hold it, driver.!
Go ahead!
Whoa! Whoa!
What happened, Arthur?
Two men held us up out on the Willow
Creek Road. They got the strongbox.
All right.
Come on, men. Let's go.
I just love this kind of stuff. Oh, come on!
Fred, got a passenger for ya on the through stage.
Be sure he gets on it.
Hot digs!
Come to 2,200 apiece.
You know something, Penny?
This is the first time...
I ever had this much money at one time in my whole life.
There's plenty more where that came from, Pop.
I got two stagecoaches lined up next week. A hundred miles apart.
Hold it, Penny. Count me out. What?
That's right. This was my last job.
After 30 years of rustling cattle and holding up banks, I'm packing it in.
This'll be easy pickin's, Pop.
No. I'm gonna take this here money... and fulfill my lifelong ambition.
What's that, Pop?
Go to Boston and open up a little dress shop.
A dress shop?
Well, wait a minute, Penny.
Just 'cause I'm rough and dirty and don't wear underwear, don't mean that I ain't artistic.
All the years we've been together,
I never heard you mention that once.
Well, I reckon it would sound kind of funny in front of the other gentlemen.
Well, if that's the way you want it.
At least we can ride together as far as Hole in the Wall.
A dress shop?
Hold it, Penny!
What is it?
Sounds like maybe 10 or 15 horses.
Nice posse size.
Let's get outta here.
Whoa! Whoa! Penny, there ain't but one thing to do.
They're gainin' on us.
We gotta split up.
You follow that stream there.
I'll head north and try to draw 'em off. Good luck, honey.
Don't get caught, Pop.
Remember your dress shop.
Yeah, it looks like one of'em.
I just love this kind of stuff.
Let's go.
I just hate this kind of stuff! Grab her, Floyd!
Where?
Where?
I don't know about grabbin' women! I ain't married!
Where's that federal marshal? He's on his way over.
You've got no right!
You've got no right holding a defenseless woman prisoner!
Now simmer down!
You just simmer down, Penny.
Marshal Bates here wants to talk to you.
Miss Cushings,
I've got a proposition for you.
Not interested!
Better hear me out.
This paper's a full pardon.
You dang fool! The marshal wants you to work for the federal government.
It's a trick!
I just love this kind of stuff!
No, it's no trick.
Now listen to me carefully.
Somebody's been smuggling guns to some renegade Comanche Indians.
What's that got to do with me?
We need your help to find out who it is.
The marshal wants you to work as an undercover agent.
We've already lost two men.
We figure they won't be suspicious of a woman posin' as a homesteader.
Well, what do you think, Penny?
I don't know.
We got enough on you to send you away for 300 years.
Ya ninny! He wants to give you a pardon!
Here, read this.
Is it a real pardon?
It's got the governor's signature on it.
You got yourself a deal.
Hey, this is pretty excitin'.
You mind if
I tell everybody?
You do and I'll shoot you... right in the mouth.
Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me where I could buy a wagon and a good team of horses?
Yep. Right across the street there.
Abel Swanson will sell you anything you want.
But watch him.
He's real slick.
He'll cheat you if he gets a chance.
Yeah? Well, he'll have to get up pretty early in the morning... to pull the wool overJesse W. Heywood's eyes.
Much obliged.
Love your hat!
Mr. Swanson?
Oh. Howdy.
I'd like to see Mr. Swanson about gettin' a good rig and a team.
Well, I don't know anything about that.
And you can tell him that just because I'm from out of town,
that don't mean I don't know what it's all about.!
Good day, sir. Abel Swanson, proprietor, at your service.
Dr. Jesse W. Heywood, dentist, Philadelphia.
Ah, a professional man! What a pleasure to do business with a man of science!
Wong, our house is honored by the presence of a physician.
Wong reveres knowledge.
We are at your service.
Uh, well...
I want to get a rig and a couple of good strong horses.
And I'll pay nothin' but a fair price.
It's a pleasure to do business with a discerning man.
Now, everything you need is right over here.
There's a potbellied stove, wrought iron skillet, twenty pounds of flour, one axe, two extra handles.
Now, let's see. A stove, $7.50; skillet,
$4.20; flour, $8.50; $9.75 for an axe.
Add that up, will you, Wong?
That comes to $47, even.
Now for the wagon...
Wait a minute.
Hold it. Hold it!
Forty-seven dollars?
The stove was $7.50.
The skillet was $4.20.
That's $11.70. Then you have...
Have you ever been in the Orient, sir? Huh?
Have you ever been in the Orient?
No, I never have.
That's amazing.
Simply amazing.
Wong, observe the analytical mind of the trained scientist.
Skilled in the arts of mathematics, physics, chemistry.
Able to understand the machinations of the Oriental calculating abacus.
Run over those figures for him again, Wong.
Yeah. That's $47, all right.
Extraordinary mind.
You, sir, are amazing.
Now, let's put you into a wagon.
Right this way.
Okay.
You are indeed a fortunate man!
This is your lucky day!
The wagon you are beholding... soon to be yours... is the only one of its kind west of the Mississippi.
How much is it?
Built of the finest oak.
Once owned by one of the great pioneers of our west, the late Sir Lincoln Boone.
I know this is no time to bring this up, but how much is it?
Excuse me. I'll let it go for a hundred dollars.
How much? One hundred and fifty dollars.
Now that seems kind of expensive to me!
Expensive? Too expensive for a vehicle worthy of transporting... one of the great scientific minds of our day?
Sir, this wagon befits you.
Wong, let us not forget. Our house is honored by the presence of a physician.
Uh, well... Now wait a...
That's enough. I, uh...
Now listen, I think 150 will be okay. Sold!
Wong, add that up.
Forty-seven and 150.
That comes to $232.55.
That is correct.
Well, figures don't lie.
That's an even $250 with the territory tax.
And that'll be cash, of course.
Territory tax?
Gracias. It was a pleasure doing business with you, sir. Chop-chop!
Uh, I'll see you.
Oh, wait a minute!
I-I almost forgot.
Well, what about the horses?
Why, surely you jest. There hasn't been a horse for sale in over three weeks.
Wait a second!
If you didn't have any horses for sale, how come you sold me that wagon and all that stuff?
We just like to keep busy.
You have no right to...
What time do you have, sir?
Huh? Oh, 5:30.
We're closed. Well...
Now just wait a minute!
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Why, you...
How am I gonna get out west if I don't have any horses?
You... You cheaters! Cheaters!
Abacus cadabacus!
Mr. Huggins?
That's right.
Penelope Cushings.
Won't you come in?
What can I do for you,
Miss Cushings?
First, I must warn you, I'm not taking on any new clients.
I expect to be leaving town shortly.
The moon is on the wane.
You?
You were looking for a woman, weren't you?
Well, yes, but you're...
Well, not like you.
Expecting someone a bit more horsey?
Sort of.
Well, I'm what they came up with, so let's get down to business.
We're to take the wagon train to San
Miguel with you posing as my wife.
Oh?
Strictly federal business.
Once there, we get in touch with Will Banks.
You've got a rig?
Waiting out in the staging area.
Any notion as to how the rifles are getting to the Indians?
Nope. There could even be some on the wagon train we're taking.
Well, now, do you have everything you need? Yes, I think so.
Good. We'll leave day after tomorrow at sunup.
Strictly federal business?
Strictly.
Done and done.
That's Sam Huggins, the lawyer.
Who did it? Shots came from across the street. This fellow staggered in.
- Did anybody call a doctor?
- Doc Gifford's out of town.
Wait a minute. There's a doctor right here in the hotel.
Dr. Jesse W. Heywood.
Room three.
Come on, Lyle!
Ernie, come on!
Hurry it up!
He don't answer.
Darn you, Lyle!
Dr. Heywood!
Dr. Heywood!
Wake up! Wake up!
Let's go up there.!
We're coming! Dr. Heywood,
Dr. Heywood! Please, wake up!
Doctor, we have an emergency in the lobby.
Hmm. Emergency.
Hmm? Yeah.
I'm awake. I'm awake.
All right, everybody.
Stand back. Give this man air.
He's probably got a badly impacted wisdom tooth.
You fool!
Here's the trouble.
Hey, you sure handled that nice last night, Doc.
Uh... morning!
Uh, look, I hope I didn't give the hotel a bad name by fainting.
I mean, I feel bad about that.
Makes me feel terrible.
Your shoe's untied.
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Well, I'll just, uh...
I'll, uh, tie it over here.
Oh, uh... uh, ma'am?
Ma'am? Wa...
Wait just...
Just... wa...
Uh, ma'am!
Oh, ma'am!
Uh, ma'am.
Excuse me, ma'am.
I just wanted to express my deepest sympathy... and to apologize for, uh... well, what happened to me there last night.
See, actually I'm a dentist.
See, I'm not a doctor.
And, well, when I see something like that,
I just sort of go all fuzzy.
What's a tender ninny like you doing out here in the first place?
Uh, ma'am, uh...
Now I realize that that may have come about as a result of your grief.
But I don't like to be called a tender ninny.
Tender ninny!
Okay. All right.
Now, all right.
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm in teeth!
And I came out here all the way from Philadelphia single-handed to fight oral ignorance!
And I intend to go further west!
West is that way.
West! And I'm gonna find me a couple of horses, and I'm leaving on the next wagon train out!
Now what do you think about that?
Um, are you going to take your tree and your dog along with you?
I'm sorry about your husband passin'on, ma'am, but rules are rules and I gotta stick to 'em.
No women alone on the wagon train.
Uh, look, Mr. Welsh, I have got to get on this wagon train.
No single women.
Company rules.
Well, I've got to find some way.
The only thing I can recommend is you find yourself a husband by 5:00 tomorrow mornin'.
A husband?
Mm-hmm.
All you need is somethin' wearin' pants goin' that way.
Uh, west is that... way.
Oh!
Hello, Dentist.
Hello!
Uh... it's you!
Aren't you going to ask me to come in?
Huh? Oh... Oh, sure!
Yeah! Come in, come in.
Oh, uh...
I like to keep my hand in.
I'm sorry to bother you like this, but I have a terrible toothache.
Is it in your mouth?
Oh, yeah.
It would be, wouldn't it?
Sure. Well, you just sit right down there, and we'll just take care of it.
I probably should have made an appointment.
I realize how busy you must be.
Oh, golly, heck!
There's always... always room for an emerg... emergency.
Uh...
I'll just, uh...
Wait a min... Uh, well...
I'll tell you what. Could you just, uh... open your mouth?
Uh... l... I need my mirror.
Oh.
That's okay.
I'll get, uh... get something else here.
Oh, do you know something?
Hmm?
When you turned away,
I noticed your profile.
It's really very attractive.
My profile?
Well...
Huh?
Oh, your hands!
Oh, they're lovely!
The hands of a surgeon.
Yeah, well, my ha...
Well, uh... hands have always run in my family.
Do you know what I think?
Uh-uh.
I think you're very nice.
Do you know what I think?
What?
I think I might faint.
Ohhh.
How did a wonderful professional man like you... escape marriage all these years?
Well, uh, I've always felt I was a little too thin for marriage.
Ohhh.
And besides, m-my main mission in life right now i-i-is to go west.
How strange fate is!
I, too, am alone and going west.
And suddenly, out of the blue sky,
I meet you.
A big... tall... handsome... man!
Now, wait a minute!
J-Just wait a minute!
I-I don't even know you.
I'm crazy about you.
Isn't that enough?
Now then, the witnesses there, Mrs.
Longbaugh and Slosh White, are 25 cents each, payable immediately following the ceremony.
Fine. Speed it up.
The wagon train leaves in an hour.
This is so sudden,
Miss Cushings.
I mean, you just don't fix a tooth one minute and get married the next.
The song is 50 cents extra.
Would you like the song?
Yes. Fine, fine.
Oh, promise me that someday...
Let's go, Reverend!
During the music?
Yes!
Well, all right.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here...
Now wait a minute!
Hold it!
I can't get married without telling my mother.
There isn't any time. We've got to catch the wagon train, uh, uh, uh...
Jesse.
Jesse.
My mother will just never forgive me for this.
We are assembled here in the presence of God to join together this man...
Now wa... We're strangers.
You know that, don't you?
I'd at least like you to meet my mother.
Speed it up, Reverend.
He has instructed those who have entered into this relationship, etc.
That's not Episcopalian!
By the authority invested in me by the Church,
I declare that you, Penelope, and, uh, you, uh...
Jesse.
And you, Jesse, are hereby man and wife.
Attaboy, Reverend!
Now, just hold it!
I don't feel at all that this is actually... I mean, the whole... the thing...
Mm-hmm.
We'd better hurry if we want to catch that wagon train.
Well, well, well. You did it, ma'am. What's the new name?
Dr. and Mrs. Jesse W.
Heywood. You ready to go?
Wagons west!
That's the ticket. Just pull up behind that last wagon.
Right.
Nice going.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just so darned excited.
Mr. and Mrs. Hiram Remington. Atlanta.
Dr. and Mrs. Jesse W.
Heywood. Philadelphia.
Dr. and Mrs. Jesse W.
Heywood. Philadelphia.
Reverend Zachary Gant and my loyal minion, Matthew Basch!
Nice couple.
Fix this crate. What are you trying to do, get us thrown in jail?
Aww, a "purty" little thing like that and a derby dude, they ain't likely to be federal men.
We can't trust anybody.
Now remember that!
Come on, fix it!
Where's Willie?
Beats me.
Willie! Willie!
Here, Ma.
I told you to do that before we left!
Oh, boy!
Keep your eye on the road.
I just can't believe it.
Tonight's our wedding night.
In a few hours, we'll stop... make camp... have a little supper... then beddy-bye.
I was in the same boat as you 35 years ago.
Is that right?
I'll never forget my wedding night as long as I live.
I'll bet.
I cried like a baby.
Willie.!
Almost done, Ma.
Penelope?
Penelope?
What do you want?
Are you beddy-bye?
I suppose so.
Guard duty, Dr. Heywood.
You're kidding!
A coyote.
Hoot owl.
Aaah!
Scare ya?
Heck no! You kiddin'?
I come to relieve you, Doc. I reckon you got some chores you want to fulfill, huh?
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Thanks. Good luck.
I'm back.
You're soft.
Come on, you little dickins!
I'll find you!
Come on now! Come on now!
Wh-Where ar... are you?
Penny!
What are you doing?
That you, Willie?
What are you doing wandering around? Shut up!
What's going on here?
I couldn't sleep, so I decided to take a walk.
That's all.
Well, you'd be lonesome, too, if your husband were on guard duty.
It's our wedding night.
Lovers' quarrel, that's all.
All right, back to bed.
Gosh, honey, I didn't realize you missed me so much.
I wonder what she's up to.
Don't you get it, Zack?
She's got the sweets on me.
I have the same trouble every place I go.
Women just come runnin' after me, wantin' to kiss me on the mouth.
Everybody up.! Everybody up.!
Indians! Indians!
Hyah!
What'll we do?
Take cover and start using that six-gun!
They're Winchesters.
The Heywood wagon.
It ain't with us.
Remington! Tyler!
Some of you men, let's go!
Get back here, you idiot.!
Bang.
Are you all right?
Uh-huh. Yeah. Fine.
Uh, I didn't know you could shoot like that.
Huh, I didn't know it myself!
Who'd have believed it?
That Doc's a gutty little cuss.
Which one's Doc Heywood?
Right there.
There he is! Hey! Doc!
The greatest!
Attaboy, Doc!
To Doc Heywood,
Indian fighter!
Say, Doc, tell us just how you killed all them Indians.
Give him a chance to clear the dust out ofhis throat.
Come on, Doc.
Drink up.!
Oh. Well.
Hmm.
It doesn't pay to drink too fast when you're thirsty.
That was good, though.
Was good.
Say, Doc, now we hear tell that you fell far behind the main wagon train.
How did that happen?
Well, I'll tell you.
That was on purpose.
There was a reason for that.
You see, it was all part of the plan.
It was all part of the plan!
As I said, it was all part of the plan.
See, I'd been spotting their signs for quite a while.
He was a-spottin' their signs!
One, maybe two months.
And then a plan began a-formulatin' in my mind.
Then a plan began a-formulatin' in his mind!
I figured I'd lay back a ways and draw 'em off the main body.
That was to give the wagon train a chance to get away.
Chance to get away! You wanna let me tell this, fella?
See, there's one thing you gotta keep in mind about Indians.
Them Indians is ten times as scared as you are...
Didn't mean to scare
Indian fighter.
You character. One of ours.
I wonder.
What?
If that skinny little Philadelphia jasper could be a federal agent.
He sure looks like a dentist to me.
How would you know?
You ain't never seen a dentist in your life.
No need to poke fun at my only weak point.
I don't know what you're talking about, lady.
I'm a roofer.
Been a roofer all my life.
Don't know nothing about the federal government.
Sam Huggins would be talking to you now, but they shot him.
Get in the wagon.
I knew it!
That whole dentist outfit was a dodge.
Look at those clothes.
He's a gunny for sure.
Yep, Matthew. That's our man.
We've gotta get rid of him.
How you gonna do it?
Simple. I'll have you pick a fight with him. Gun him down in the street.
Now, wait a minute, Reverend.
I ain't gonna tangle with him.
What's the matter?
'Fraid he'll kill you?
That's part of it. The main thing is if he nicks me, why, the scar will just ruin my looks.
I'll get a professional.
I hear that Arnold the Kid's in town.
Good!
Heck, you're always better off with a specialist, anyway.
Yeah?
Well, I'll sure know where to look if I ever need a coward.
Yep.
Arnold, kill Heywood,
I'll give you $600.
All right.
I'll give you $850.
All right.
I'll give you $ 1,000.
They told me this outfit was an original.
Get out of my way.
What?
You heard me.
Get out of my way!
Well, now. Just who do you think you are?
Arnold the Kid.
Doc the Heywood.
That name don't scare you?
It scares me this much.
All right, Mr. Kid.
Now you've gone just a little bit too far.
You're really asking for it.
Make your play!
I'll make my play.
I'll make my play.
Ippity-doo, kanaba dip, double dare, knock off the chip!
Now, what's this all about?
You wanna know what that's all about?
I'll tell you what that's all about.
You knock off that chip and you'll see what it's all about.
Uh-huh. Okay.
All right.
Okay. I'm gonna tell you something right now.
You just happen to know what I did?
Do you happen to know what I did?
Well, I'll tell you what I did!
I killed twelve Indians and two horses in one fight.
Now, how do you like those bananas?
Pass the word to clear the street.
I'll meet you here in half an hour.
Wear your gun.
Hey, I think you might have something with that Minister Gant.
They checked on him back East, and he ain't no Pentecostal.
And he sure ain't no Mormon.
They couldn't find one persuasion that ever heard tell ofhim.
Those Bible boxes were sure long and heavy.
Hey, maybe you and your husband could scout around the church.
See what's in them boxes.
Forget my husband.
He's just some Philadelphia jay
I got tied up with to get me out here.
The sooner I get rid of him, the better.
Appears to me like he could be of some help.
I hear he's pretty good with a six-gun.
What's going on?
That's Heywood out there practicing.
I heard two shots.
That means, uh, he's got four to go.
That's six. Call him out.
Heywood!
Did you want me for something?
It's been exactly a half hour.
Mm-hmm.
Heywood, I'm even gonna let you draw first.
Thank you.
Oooh! Aah!
A seven-shooter?
Hey! Great! Attaboy!
What'd you do that for?
I thought you wanted to get rid of that jay.
I don't know.
Something just come over me.
Great work, Doc.
You showed them.
Atta way, Doc.
Boy, you sure are something.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, fellas. Excuse me.
Uh, Penny!
Penny!
Did you hear about it?
I heard.
'Bout the only thing that saved me was the old killer instinct.
Uh-huh.
What about supper? I've got something to do. I'll see you later.
But I ain't seen you all day. Doc
Heywood! The sheriff wants you!
Who? The sheriff wants to see you.
Just a minute, son. Penny, look... He says it's important!
Well, all right. Where are you gonna be later? I'll be around.
Yeah.
Darn women. So excitable.
Whenever you're ready, Leonard.
Hold it like that now.
That's dandy.
Thank you.
There. That'll be a real nice picture for us.
The man who got Arnold the Kid. Well.
I guess we don't need this anymore.
Oh, say. Can I have that? I'd kind of like to keep it for a souvenir.
Sure, Doc.
Help yourself.
Leonard, get that picture developed as soon as you can.
Here, you want me to give you a hand with this?
Yes, please.
There we are.
Oh. Excuse me.
Uh, have you seen this "ladiola"?
Ah, sí, si.!
Senora dentista. Aqui.
The church?
Aqui.
Gracias, senor.
Penny!
Hold it!
What's the matter?
Thought I heard something.
Penny!
Oooh! Aah!
Penny!
Shut up.!
Penny!
Keep it quiet!
I've been looking all over town for you.
What do you want?
Is that you?
Yes, that's me.
I'll explain one of these days, but not right now.
I can't believe this!
I just can't...
You mean you're a thief? A cattle rustler? What's this all about?
I'll explain it later. Right now
I'm on government business.
Like what? Like stealing rifles from a nice church?
Shhh!
It's her. She's the agent. Let's get her.
No. Not now. Let's wait till
Doc Heywood ain't here.
Come on. Out.
It's really none of your business.
Now, let's get out of here.
Government business? What kind of government business? Hold your voice down!
But I don't get it.
One minute you're a bank robber, the next minute you're working for the government.
All right. It's true.
I am Bad Penny Cushings.
But the government said they'd clean up my record if I did this job for them.
What job?
I can't tell you any more.
Now, look. I don't know if you realize it, but our marriage is getting pretty shaky.
Now, I want to know what's going on.
All right.
Now, can I count on you to keep this quiet? Of course!
Hold your voice down.
Of course.
The government promised me amnesty... if I found out who's smuggling rifles to the Indians.
It's Gant and Basch!
Gant and Basch?
The minister and his loyal minion?
He's no minister.
And he's no minion.
I don't know, Penny.
Everything's just moving too fast.
First you came to me with a toothache; we got married; we got on the wagon train; bang, bang, bang; hurray, hurray.
Then I found out you're a crook. Then you're not a crook, you're working with the government.
Everything's just moving too fast.
Poor little dude.
You're tired, aren't you?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I think the best thing to do is to go to bed.
Huh?
I said I think the best thing to do is to go to bed.
Are you changing?
Uh-huh.
I'll just change in the closet.
You can't sleep like that!
Those spurs'll kill me!
I've got to get to Fort Tyler to get the military.
But you said...
I mean, I thought that we...
Fort Tyler?
Don't you understand? If the Indians get those rifles, they'll wipe out this town.
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, well, I better come with you.
I'm pretty handy with a gun, you know.
I'm afraid not, dentist. You couldn't hit a bleeding elephant in the snow.
Are you kiddin'?
Twelve Indians, two horses and Arnold the Kid.
Look, you might as well know.
I shot the Indians from inside the wagon.
And Arnold the Kid from the window.
What?
You mean, I didn't...
I mean, none of those...
Nobody?
Nobody.
I'm sorry to have to tell you that, dentist.
But I wouldn't want you to come with me.
You might get hurt.
Are you coming back?
I'm afraid not.
But...
But you're my wife.
That was just to get on the wagon train.
I'm sorry.
Vaya con Dios, amigo.
Gracias.
There he is! Hey!
Attaboy!
All the way down!
Hold it, please.
Just a minute.
Uh, there's something that l...
I have to tell you.
Come on, Doc.
Speak up.
No. No more.
Now, I don't want you to think that I'm not grateful for the drinks, and for your all being so nice and everything.
But, uh, well, I'm just gonna tell you straight out.
Doc the Heywood, the well-known Indian fighter, is a fake.
It's true! It is absolutely true!
Just as long as I'm standing here, right here, right now. It's the truth.
Well, Doc, somebody killed them dozen Indians.
Now, who killed 'em?
My wife.
Just a second.!
Just a second.
Hold 'er up.
You got the Kid because we all seen it. Right!
You got him... zang! With one shot while you was a-fallin' down!
That's right!
Clean shot!
My wife got him from a window.
I wasted all my shots like a darned dumbbell! Don't you remember?
I shot two at the can, two at the sign, one at the skillet... and one in the pants.
All right now!
Hold it! Hold it!
I was watchin' the whole thing.
Now, let's see. There was, uh, there was two at the can, two at the sign, one at the skillet... and one in the pants.
Two in the can, two at the sign, one at the skillet... and one in the pants.
Oh! Oh!
Help! Aaah!
Failure, failure, failure. failure, failure, failure, failure.
That's the story of my life, you know.
Two things have always been my downfall.
I have always been... the most failure of anybody, and I'm too thin.
I don't think you're too thin.
It's all bloat.
Bloated thin failure!
That's me!
I think you're wonderful.
I just love a man that can't make his... mark in life.
Penny, hmm. Penny, she's really somethin', you know that?
Mmm-mm.
Mmm.
And she used me.
And she... she tricked me.
She made me think... that she loved me.
Aww.
I should've known better.
Nobody ever loved me.
Did you know I had to take my own cousin to the graduation dance?
Awww.
I threw up on her dress.
You are really my kind of guy.
I got on a romance track.
Then I got on a gunslinger's track.
I gotta get back on that dentist's track.
Go ahead. Laugh!
Laugh all you like.
I'm not a failure.
I'm a dentist!
A real dentist.
And I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna spread dental health through the West like a plague!
Come on. I wanna close up.
Good night, Doc.
Brush your dentist twice a day.
Visit your toothbrush once a year.
Hyah!
Penny.!
Penny!
Penny! Pen...
Water.
Uh!
Water. Water.
I gotta have water. l...
Water. I gotta have water.
Uh! Air! I gotta have air!
Air!
Penny! Penny!
Watay. Watay.!
Watay.
Watay. Watay.
Watay.
How many did we give out?
That tallies 181.
That girl. I think I know her.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Isn't that
Laughing Deer's daughter?
No. The Deer girl married White Antelope.
Rotten Buffalo's cousin? Ohhh!
Ah wan no.
Ah wan no.
Watay.
Watay?
Ah. Ah. Watay?
Watay?
Uh-huh watay.!
Dentist, you're crazy!
Are you all right?
Except for these bindings.
They're killing my hands.
I figure the best time to get out is after they all get a little drunker.
You know something?
You're a lot spunkier than I thought you were.
I get that from my mother.
Sat tey wahn ney.!
He's crazy about me.
Sat tey wahn ney.!
Looks like we're going dancing.
Here. We're gonna need this when we make our break.
Be careful.
Put me down!
Reverend.
Minion.
Well, now.
If it ain't Doc Heywood, gunfighter.
Phony gunfighter.
Say, Doc. How 'bout us havin' a real gunfight, huh?
And to make it even, it'll be just you against me and the good Reverend here.
Now, uh, what do you think about that?
You wanna know what I think about that?
Well, I'll just show you what I think about that.
Well.
Put it on, Heywood.
Anytime you're ready,
Heywood.
We've got horses right back there, Penny. Let's go.
Let me go!
Jesse's out there.
Oh, Jesse!
Let's go.
Watay?
Rider coming in!
Get ready.
They're comin'!
Get the women and the kids back into the church. Get back in the church!
Well, they're sure takin' their sweet time about it.
Devils!
Hold it.
What the...
Doc Heywood's with 'em.
He sure is.
Open up, boys.
Everything's under control.
Jesse! You're alive!
Yeah! I know.
Take my friend Black Eagle and fix him up with a big rare steak!
Adjustments are free up to 60 days.
After that, it's a dollar a visit.
I'm so glad you're back.
Me too!
Oh, come on, now.
Come... Come on!
Wait a minute! Wait...

- Well, there's young Cantrell.
- Let's go, he's a day late.
All right.
Ah, Dickinson. Hold that a minute, will you? Don't drop it.
That's my whole case in there.
Evidence, affidavits, everything.
Try dressing on the front seat at a gallop.
- How do I look?
- That's how you look.
- Turn around. I expected you yesterday.
- I know.
- Any luck at the Jorgenson ranch?
- No, not yet.
Hightower, take the rest of this gear to adjutant's quarters, will you?
Yes, sir.
- How much time we got?
- None. Come on.
- All my buttons buttoned?
- Yes.
Officers' wives?
Oh, they're not going to let the women sit in on this, are they?
Spicy case like yours, try and keep them out, they have your scalp.
Trying to make it into a Roman circus.
Tom, they want to see a hanging.
President of the court-martial is Colonel Otis Thornton Fosgate...
I know, I know all about it.
I know Old Stone Face.
Tom, I admire you for defending Rutledge, but you might as well know,
I think he's as guilty as hell.
Well, you might as well know, I don't.
Is Mary Beecher here?
Not too friendly.
I'm not calling her as a friend,
I'm calling her as a witness.
Good luck, Tom.
Mary, I know this is going to be an ordeal for you, but I had to call on you. Rutledge needs all the help that he can get.
And whose fault is that?
What is done is done.
We're in the hands of the court now, and whatever you feel about...
But you're defending him.
You. You of all men.
Well, if you had some knowledge of the facts...
Ten-hut.
Silence. Silence. Quiet.
You civilians, get those hats off.
Put out those cigars.
Sergeant, see that they do, and if they don't, throw them out.
Yes, sir.
Otis isn't feeling very well this morning.
- He had a little glass of wine last night.
- Yes.
I want something understood right here and now.
This is a court-martial.
It is not a quilting bee.
It's not a quilting bee.
Now, if there is any further disturbance, or undue chatter,
I am going to clear this court at once.
Cordelia, your husband wouldn't put us out, would he?
He wouldn't dare. Just let him try.
- Court is ready, sir.
- Very good, Captain.
Now, I have been told that counsel for the defense is not in the post.
- Well, if that's true...
- Lieutenant Cantrell is present, sir.
My apologies if my last-minute arrival has inconvenienced the court.
Very good, Cantrell.
Now, is trial judge advocate ready to prosecute this case?
Captain Shattuck, sir.
I'm ready for the prosecution.
Oh, yes. Yeah.
You're the officer sent down from General
Nelson Miles' headquarters, aren't you?
I see, you wear the 14th Infantry insignia.
I been away from the regiment, sir, detailed to the Judge Advocate-General's department for 10 years.
Oh, yes. Lawyer, eh? Lawyer.
Sent down here to keep a staff eye on field soldier justice, is that it?
On the contrary, sir, justice was guaranteed the accused when you were detailed as president of this court.
Now, counsel being ready and present, this general court appointed by departmental special order 104 under date 8th August, 1881, is now in session.
All right, Sergeant. The accused,
Sergeant Rutledge, will be brought in.
Yes, sir.
First Sergeant Braxton Rutledge, C Troop,
9th United States Cavalry.
Hang him from the rafters. Hang him high.
Quiet. Quiet.
- Mr. President?
- Order.
Mr. President, I request this courtroom be cleared of all spectators.
This is not a public show.
A soldier is on trial for his life before this court.
And furthermore, by the very nature of the charges alone, this is certainly no place for ladies.
Request granted. Dickinson.
Clear this courtroom of everybody not directly connected with this case.
Clear them.
Everybody.
Out.
Otis, Otis, tell this person you don't mean me.
Out, Cordelia.
Captain Dickinson, escort Mrs. Fosgate and her friends to the door.
Oh, really.
This is the most absurd thing
I ever heard in my life.
Otis Fosgate, wait till I get you home and really tell you what I think of you.
Now, gentlemen, I want counsel for both sides to understand that this court-martial is being held behind closed doors with no prejudice toward the accused, and solely because of the scandalous nature of the charges and to avoid offense to public decency.
- Mulqueen, read the charge sheet.
- Sir.
Since the court acknowledges the unspeakable nature of the charges,
I would like to suggest that out of deference to the young lady whose presence is necessary as a witness, that the court omit reading of the charges and specifications in detail and simply cite the accused as charged with violation of the 92nd Article of War on both counts.
Defense Counsel, any objections?
As long as the court is aware of Captain Shattuck's sly attempt to create prejudice, no objections.
The accused stands charged with violation of the 92nd Article of War on both counts.
Sergeant Rutledge, how do you plead?
- Guilty or not guilty?
- Not guilty to both charges, sir.
Not guilty?
Lieutenant Cantrell, is this prisoner's plea made on advice of counsel?
Yes, sir. Not guilty on both charges and not guilty on all specifications, sir.
All right, proceed, proceed.
All right, Captain Shattuck, call your first witness.
- I call Miss Mary Beecher to the stand.
- Sir, I appeal to the court.
Captain Shattuck knows very well Miss
Beecher is here as witness for the defense.
Sir, I know of no rule which says prosecution may not call the defense witness so long as it does not later impeach her testimony.
Miss Beecher, please.
Do you swear the evidence you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so, help you God, ma'am?
- I do.
- Thank you, ma'am.
And now, Miss Beecher, in your own words, will you kindly acquaint the court with all the circumstances that lead up to your first meeting with the accused, Sergeant Rutledge?
And everything that transpired thereafter?
Well, I... I was returning to Arizona after an absence of
12 years in the East.
And when I arrived at Junction City,
I discovered that there were no longer any passenger trains running through to Spindle Station into Fort Linton.
And through the friendship of a conductor, Mr. Owens, whom I known since I was a little girl,
I managed to get a ride in the caboose of his freight train and I was supposed to meet my father at Spindle Station.
Mr. Owens had sent him a telegram from Junction City.
And it was on the caboose of that freight train that I first met Lieutenant Cantrell.
He says the horses need water.
- You hear that, Owens?
- You think I'm deaf? Deaf and dumb?
You been screaming for water louder than them remounts since we left Junction City.
How long before we get to Spindle Station, Mr. Owens?
Well, the way I got it figured, with the sand on the tracks and the wind against us, I say, half-hour at the outside. About midnight.
You hear that, Miss Beecher?
Half-hour, you'll get off at Spindle, and I'll go on to Fort Linton.
You sound surprised, Lieutenant Cantrell.
What I been trying to say is that you're a very attractive, young and a rather mysterious lady, and I'm a lonely bachelor in a lonely land.
Now, there's nothing mysterious about me.
I'm just coming home after 12 years.
But somehow, it doesn't seem like coming home at all.
I forgotten what a lonely land
Arizona territory really is.
Why did your father send you back East, Mary?
Was it school or what?
No, it was promise he made to my mother, just before she died.
I hated going. I loved Arizona then.
And now, I just don't know.
Don't you worry, Mary.
I sent your father that telegram from Junction City like you told me, and he'll be at Spindle Station to meet you and mighty glad to see you, too.
Why, sure he will.
You know, Arizona has changed considerably since Geronimo was taken.
We haven't had any Apache trouble in, oh, I don't know, two or three years.
Spindle Station coming up.
You and your dad-blame horses, Laredo.
You're running powerful late already.
If he had his way, Mary, he have me throw you off the train without stopping.
If you're in such a all-fired hurry, fetch out her other bag.
- Would you like some more hot coffee...
- No, thank you.
It's a pretty long, cold ride over there to Spanish Wells.
I'll have to get used to these Arizona distances.
Well, now, you know, it's only about an hour on the train from Fort Linton to Spindle, and then from Spindle to Spanish Wells, that's just a short day's ride.
- Well, that's still quite a distance.
- Not if there's a welcome at the end of it.
- My name's Tom.
- Goodbye, Tom.
There will be a welcome for you.
Bye, Mary.
Oh, Nate. Nate Hedges.
Hey, Nate, wake up, Nate.
Nate, where are you?
He's around here someplace. I just...
Hey, Nate. Nate Hedges, wake up.
Hey, Nate.
Oh, Nate.
There ain't nobody here to meet you, Mary.
I did send that telegram to your Dad, you know.
Well, don't worry, Mr. Owens,
I'm sure he'll be along soon.
Well, Nate will take care of you till he come. You remember Nate Hedges, don't you?
- Why, Nate Hedges, is he still here?
- What's the trouble, Mary?
My father isn't here yet, and I don't know what...
Excuse me, just a minute, Mary,
I think I'm going to...
Nate. Busy, Nate?
Nate. Nate?
Busy?
Now, look here, Owens.
I got two carloads of valuable remounts on that train.
You ain't going to hold me up for anymore of that hugging and kissing.
- Hold your horses, Laredo.
- That's just what I ain't going to do.
Nate.
Hold it.
Hey, nobody starts that train but me.
Mary, you're the most beautiful girl
I ever seen.
- And don't forget I said it to you.
- Oh, hush. Hurry now.
Mr. Hedges?
Nate?
Nate?
Mr. Hedges.
Nate. Nate. Nate, wake up.
Don't scream, Miss. Don't scream.
It was... It was as though he sprung up at me out of the earth.
I couldn't move, I couldn't scream.
It was like a nightmare.
And that man who sprang at you from the darkness like something from a nightmare, is he here in this court?
- Oh, yes, but I...
- Is that man who seized you so brutally and viciously, is he here in this courtroom?
- Well, yes, he is sitting right there...
- Is it that man there,
- that colored soldier?
- I object.
I withdraw the word colored.
I refer to the accused, Sergeant Rutledge.
Is he the man who seized you so viciously, Miss Beecher?
- Yes, but, what I'm trying to tell you...
- That is all, Miss Beecher.
Your witness, Lieutenant Cantrell.
Sir, gentlemen.
A soldier's life is at stake, and this man is playing cheap, legal tricks.
- I resent that, sir.
- That's enough.
I will have no personalities between counsel.
Proceed, Lieutenant.
Prosecution has stolen a key defense witness and ruthlessly cut off the testimony at a point highly unfavorable to the accused.
This is not the proper time for Defense Counsel to argue the case.
He should either cross-examine or dismiss the witness.
The manual for court-martial clearly states, The trial judge advocate should do his utmost to present the whole truth and to oppose every attempt to suppress the facts or to distort them.
Now, I ask the court not to accept the half-truth that Captain Shattuck has so slickly presented, but to insist on the whole truth, by letting Miss Beecher go on with the story.
I object, sir. If this is not a personal attack on me and my...
Sit down. Now, Miss Beecher, tell me.
- Is there more to your story?
- Yes. Yes, there is.
Well, I think I speak for the other members of this court when I say that I like to hear it.
Now, Miss Beecher, as I recall the testimony before Captain Shattuck cut you off,
Sergeant Rutledge was pressing his hand over your mouth.
Now tell us, what happened then?
Well, he... He warned me.
He warned me not to scream again.
He said, Don't scream again, Miss.
Don't scream.
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm First Sergeant Rutledge,
United States Cavalry.
Quiet, ma'am. I ain't going to hurt you.
But I ain't going to let you scream.
Now, you listen to me.
I been blood trailed all the way into Spindle by three Mescaleros.
They jumped me about a mile back, got my horse.
I killed one.
The other two are out there somewhere.
Do you understand? Apaches.
Now, tell me, what did you find in there?
He's dead.
- The old man, the stationmaster?
- Yes.
I just put my hand on his shoulder, and he fell to the floor.
I was moving around awful fast.
One could circled ahead of me, maybe.
Oh, you mean, while I was in there, an Apache...
Stop it.
It's where they are now.
How did he fall, loose or how?
He was all limp and...
Less than one hour dead in this weather?
I don't know.
My father.
My father's coming here to meet me. If the
Apaches are out there, they'll kill him.
It ain't your father now. It's you and me.
You're a Western woman, you can use a gun?
- Oh, yes, but...
- They'll have no mercy on you, lady.
They'll have no mercy.
Look out.
Do we have to go in there?
No, you stay here while I police up the place.
- What were you doing out there?
- It's all right. You can come in now.
I took him outside. The best I could do.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
Your father got word you were coming?
Yes. The conductor telegraphed him from Junction City.
Name Beecher? Spanish Well Ranch?
You mean he didn't get it? Let me see.
Maybe a file copy.
A line rider could taken it on out to the ranch.
Dad isn't here.
When you had the lamp out back, you were reading sign.
- What is it?
- Apaches.
The ones that jumped us, they didn't kill the old man.
- You mean it wasn't Apaches?
- It was Apaches, but an earlier party.
The signs out back showed
30 or 40 unshod ponies.
It must been an awful big breakout at San Rosario Reservation.
Our ranch is on San Rosario Road.
It's a good thing your father didn't get the message.
No time to be caught out on the roads, Miss.
However, you and I got to get some rest and food.
I'll see if I can rustle us up something.
- No, let me do it.
- No, you stay.
I'm sorry, Miss.
I been a First Sergeant too long.
What I meant to say is, rest easy here till I come back.
Please continue, Miss Beecher.
Tell us what happened then.
Well, the storm seemed to grow in violence.
The wind blew stronger and stronger.
I thought I heard a coyote howl.
And I was afraid.
Terribly afraid.
I'm Mary Beecher.
- What did you say your name is?
- Rutledge. Braxton Rutledge.
First Sergeant, 9th Cavalry.
I didn't know they had any colored...
I mean, are you from Fort Linton?
The 9th Cavalry relieved the white garrison a few years back.
- Then you must know Lieutenant Cantrell?
- Yes, I know him.
That Apache cut you out there.
Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm all right. You get out.
- I won't.
- There's whiskey up there.
- You want whiskey?
Up there on the shelf. Give it to me.
That isn't a knife cut.
Gunshot. Apaches didn't do it.
When did you leave Fort Linton?
- A while back.
- Yesterday?
- I said, A while back.
- Look, Sergeant.
I know you got to sleep, but suppose the Apaches come back?
When Apaches kill and run, chances are they don't come back.
I'll get you something to eat.
Please don't go to sleep.
It will be hot in a minute.
You take yours in there in the next room.
- I'll dish my own up.
- You stay where you are.
I'll get yours.
Anyone come, you ain't going to be in here with me.
- What're you talking about?
- I'm talking about you.
A white woman.
White women only spell trouble for any of us.
That's nonsense.
We're just two people trying to stay alive.
Lady, you don't know how hard I'm trying to stay alive.
Sergeant, the telegraph.
Do you know how to work the telegraph key?
No use. The wire is cut.
Well, I suppose I must have slept sometime during the night.
But, I thought that night would never end.
But at any time that night, did Sergeant Rutledge
- threaten or molest you in any way?
- Certainly not.
He never stirred from his cot.
So then, what Captain Shattuck tried to picture to the court as a brutal and vicious attack upon you by Sergeant Rutledge was in reality nothing more than an effort to prevent you from betraying your presence to those two Apaches?
- Sergeant Rutledge saved my life.
- Thank you.
- Any further questions, Captain Shattuck?
- No questions, sir.
You may step down, Miss Beecher. And
I trust we haven't unduly distressed you.
All right, gentlemen. We had just about enough of this legal jockeying.
Now, let's put first things first and clearly establish the facts and the nature of the crimes with which the accused has been charged.
Call your next witness, Captain Shattuck.
I call Mrs. Colonel Fosgate.
What? What did you say?
You mean, you're calling my wife as a witness?
Yes, sir.
Well, if you knew you were going to have her on that stand, why didn't...
- I called Mrs. Colonel Fosgate.
- I wouldn't have...
Well, all right, Sergeant, all right.
Mulqueen, the water.
I said, The water.
That foots-logger knew all the time he was going to have her up there.
I'll never be able to...
Cordelia, you were called here as a witness.
What are these other ladies doing here?
Otis Fosgate, I would not come here without a chaperon with all these men.
- My goodness, my mother...
- All right, all right.
All right, ladies. Sit down, sit down and be quiet.
Cordelia, take the chair.
- The chair?
- Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.
- What chair?
- This chair here, ma'am.
Oh?
Yes, ma'am.
- The chair, ma'am.
- Yes, thank you.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God, ma'am?
Is that the King James version of the Bible?
- Do you swear to tell the truth...
- I don't swear on anything
- but the King James Bible.
- Do you swear to tell the truth...
Cordelia, a Bible is a Bible.
Put your hand. Go on. Swear.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing...
She does.
Carry on, Shattuck.
Mrs. Fosgate, do you recognize the subject of this miniature painting?
It's dear little Lucy Dabney.
- Lucy Dabney.
- Yes.
With the little gold cross she always wore around her neck.
I would like to place this in evidence, sir.
Accepted.
Now, Mrs. Fosgate, you and your husband were quartered on the post at Fort Linton
- at the time of the murders, were you not?
- Oh, yes.
And you knew the Post Commander Major Dabney
- as well as his young daughter, Lucy?
- Oh, yes, very well.
Now, Mrs. Fosgate,
I know that to a woman of your breeding, this is painful beyond words.
But I would like you to tell the court, when was the last time you saw Lucy Dabney alive?
The last time I saw Lucy was at the sutler's store, Mr. Hubble's.
She came riding up on her horse.
So young, so lovely.
- Hi, Mrs. Fosgate.
- Yes. Hi.
- Hello, Mrs. Hackett.
- Darling.
Lucy Dabney, riding astride.
When will your father realize that you're a grownup young lady?
Yes.
Papa says as long as I say my prayers and behave myself with the young lieutenants, he doesn't care if I ride like Lady Godiva.
You're a very beautiful young girl, considering you grown up without your poor dear mother.
- Avery nice one.
- Well, thank you, Mrs. Fosgate.
Hi, Mr. Hubble.
Say, Brax, you were right about that horse.
High-stepping action and sensitive mouth.
Thought you like her, Miss Lucy.
You know, I took her over four and a half feet yesterday.
Four and a half feet?
You're going to get your neck broke, child.
I don't want you jumping a horse when I am not around. Do you hear?
Yes.
You watch it.
Chris, you got Miss Lucy's order ready?
Sure have, Dad.
- Hi, Chris.
- Hi, Lucy.
- Four and a half feet.
- Well, I did so.
Well, four feet, anyway.
Thank you, Mr. Hubble.
My dear, is it wise to be so friendly with...
Brax?
- Brax Rutledge?
- Yes.
Well, I known him ever since I was so high.
- I know, but...
- He taught me how to ride.
Here you are, Lucy. Just like you ordered.
Six skeins of white wool.
Say, when are you going to knit me a pair of socks?
What about Ellie Jorgenson?
I don't want that redhead putting burrs under my saddle.
Oh, she won't get jealous over socks.
She is knitting me a sweater.
Say, you better let me help you with these packages.
They're pretty heavy for a little girl like you.
Come on, Chris Hubble, oh, honest...
That was the last time I saw
Lucy Dabney alive.
Now tell me, Mrs. Fosgate.
Tell me in your own words, when was the last time you saw Sergeant Rutledge?
- You mean...
- Yes.
Well, I was in my bedroom, writing a letter to my daughter, Barbara at Fort Walla Walla, Washington.
She's married to Lieutenant Pritchett.
You know of the Pritchetts of Pritchettsville?
Yes.
And she is expecting again.
Well, Otis and I couldn't be more on edge if it was us.
Wouldn't it?
Please, Cordelia, what about Rutledge?
Rutledge? Rutledge who?
The accused, Sergeant Rutledge.
You said you saw him again that evening, what about it?
- You were in your room, writing...
- Yes, I was in my room, writing, and I heard two shots. Bang, Bang.
So I rushed quickly to the window and I saw him.
That gentleman there.
It was Sergeant Rutledge, and I watched him till he disappeared into the darkness.
He was headed straight for East Gate.
- If you like my opinion...
- Thank you, Mrs. Fosgate.
Your witness, Lieutenant Cantrell.
Defense does not challenge Mrs. Fosgate's testimony, sir. There will be no questions.
Mr. President, if the Defense Counsel accepts Mrs. Fosgate's testimony as fact, must we go on?
Cantrell, why don't you plead your man guilty and throw him on the mercy of the court?
That's your privilege, Cantrell.
Care to exercise it?
I do not, sir.
Get on with it, Cantrell.
That's all, Cordelia, goodbye.
One more question for Mrs. Fosgate on redirect.
Haddock. Captain Haddock.
I knew a Captain Haddock.
He was the veterinarian who took care of...
- My name is Shattuck, ma'am.
- Shattuck?
Now, Mrs. Fosgate, please tell us when was the exact time you saw
Sergeant Rutledge ride past your window?
It was exactly 8:00.
Nonsense, Cordelia.
You haven't known what time it was since the day we were married.
It was exactly 8:00.
Because the clock was striking 8:00.
The little china clock with the painted flowers that you stole while your men were burning Atlanta.
Thank you, Mrs. Fosgate.
You been an excellent witness.
Is that all?
Shattuck, Haddock. Haddock.
Captain Haddock. Captain Fish.
Fish, pretty fish.
Fish, Captain Fish.
You were wonderful.
Thank you, Captain Fish.
- Oh, you were...
- Ladies, quiet.
Cordelia, quiet, please. Ladies, sit down.
Go ahead, Shattuck, go ahead.
I call the Fort Linton post surgeon,
Dr. Walter Eckner.
Swear him in, Sergeant.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God, sir?
- I do.
- Shattuck, I...
I suppose you're going to have the doctor give us all of the frank medical details?
I'm afraid I have no choice, sir. The condition of both bodies is vital to my...
All right, all right.
Sergeant, escort the ladies into the orderly room. Have them wait there.
Yes, sir.
I don't see how you can do...
- You understand, I'm a surprise witness...
- Yes, Mrs. Fosgate.
Yes, ma'am, but please right through there.
Water.
Proceed.
Dr. Eckner, you were at Fort Linton the night of the murders, were you not?
As there was no senior officer on the post,
I ordered the bodies left as they were, and went to meet Lieutenant Cantrell at the station.
The railroad station.
We returned to
Major Dabney's quarters together.
Lieutenant Cantrell and myself.
- What happened?
- Lamp.
Glad to see you back, sir. Mighty glad.
This is a terrible thing.
Ladies, this is no place for children or any of you.
Please go to your quarters.
- Why, Cordelia.
- The idea of him trying to talk like that.
Get rid of the men you don't need, Skidmore.
Yes, sir.
Major Dabney, Lieutenant.
Dead by a gunshot wound through the heart. A service gun.
This toy didn't kill him.
- Light that lamp.
- Yes, sir.
It's been fired twice.
Strangled.
Beaten, violated and then strangled.
The filthy...
I suppose the Major surprised him while he was still...
Ja, ja. The Major shoots and wounds him, you can see the blood here.
Then he kills the Major and runs.
You see the blood drops from here to the door.
Why should he stop to cover the body with a serape so carefully?
A twisted mind, maybe, who knows? Mad.
There is an odd mark also here on the throat.
Not from strangulation.
More like a cut, but not a cut.
Could you hand me that picture, Doctor?
The little gold cross she always wore around her neck, it's been torn off.
Ja, I remember Lucy's little cross.
Well, you never can tell about such a criminal. Degenerate.
He takes the cross, perhaps a symbol of the purity he has destroyed.
- Who's sergeant of the guards?
- Skidmore, sir.
Skidmore, send a runner for the First Sergeant.
- You mean Rutledge, sir?
- Yes. I'm going to need his help on this.
Rutledge is not here, sir.
What the hell do you mean, he's not here?
Where is he? Speak up.
Sir, I just don't know.
When was the last time you saw him?
He rode past the guardhouse looking for Major Dabney shortly before 8:00...
Major Dabney wouldn't be at the guardhouse.
Normally he be here in his... Yes, sir?
You mean Rutledge was here?
Rutledge?
But it couldn't be Rutledge.
Assembly at this hour?
What's the idea, Skidmore?
That's why Rutledge was looking for Major Dabney, sir.
Apache raiding party loose.
Three ranches burned down.
Officer of the guard must be forming a patrol, sir.
Apaches?
Trouble come double, sir.
I had both bodies removed to the post hospital.
And autopsy confirmed my spot findings.
Major Dabney shot through the heart.
His daughter, Lucy, ravaged and strangled.
The work of a degenerate.
The work of a degenerate, indeed.
Your witness, Mr. Cantrell.
Oh, no questions.
- What?
- It's stupid not to cross-examine...
Wait a minute, Doctor. Wait a minute.
Stay right where you are.
Tom.
That is the second witness against the accused that you have failed to cross-examine.
Tom, as Defense Counsel, it is your duty to see...
As Defense Counsel, sir,
I'm only trying to establish the truth.
Well, naturally, we all are...
I believe both Dr. Eckner and Mrs. Fosgate have told the truth.
Tom, that was entirely beside the point...
But if you disagree, I'll be very happy to recall Mrs. Fosgate and...
Step down, Doctor.
All right, Shattuck, call your next witness.
Come on, let's not delay here.
I am certain that by now this court is well aware of the peculiar involvement of Lieutenant Cantrell in this case.
So I trust that I shall not again be charged with employing cheap, legal tricks when I call as my next witness,
Defense Counsel himself.
Lieutenant Cantrell.
- Well, have you any objections, Cantrell?
- No, certainly not, sir.
All right, get up there. Take the stand.
Sergeant, swear him in.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...
I do.
Dr. Eckner has testified that after hearing assembly sounded, you left the scene of the crimes for post headquarters.
Will you tell us what action you took then?
Certainly.
As senior officer present,
I took command of the post and sent a galloper to the survey camp to inform Colonel Fosgate.
- You can confirm that, sir?
- Of course, yes, yes.
Now, when the Colonel returned to the post,
I left with the patrol at once, by forced march, where we arrived at Spindle Station shortly after dawn.
Skidmore, take two men and cover the rear.
- Don't touch that gun, Lieutenant.
- I won't have to, because you're going to hand me that rifle butt end first.
No, sir. You take me back now, they'll hang me sure.
Is that a confession, Rutledge?
Drop it, Brax.
Get him.
Hold him down.
Get those arms out here.
Skidmore.
Why didn't you shoot me when you had the chance?
We may yet.
All right, Skidmore, search him.
And I mean hat, boots, socks, and bring me every single thing you find on him.
Do what you can to fix up that wound.
Are you all right?
He didn't hurt you, did he?
Of course not. He saved my life.
Did you have to treat him like an animal?
He's under arrest for the murder of his commanding officer.
Oh, I don't believe it.
What about your father?
What happened to him?
I don't know. He just never got here.
Mary, when I got word at Fort Linton...
Apaches were in this district, and I left you here alone, I was really...
Not alone.
Sergeant Rutledge was here.
And no officer could protected a woman more gallantly.
Skidmore, bring in the prisoner.
Here's everything we found on Rutledge, sir.
Put it right there.
See what this says.
I, Colonel Thurston Tillman, of Rutledge Hall, Prince Edward County, do on this twelfth day of April, 1861, manu...
Manumit and entirely set free and forever quit claim the body and services of the slave boy called
Braxton Rutledge.
- What did you expect to find, Lieutenant?
- Well, I didn't find it.
All right, Rutledge, what happened here last night?
- Why don't you ask the lady?
- I'm asking you.
Can't you see he's hurt and worn out?
Why don't you let him sit down?
- Thank you, ma'am, I can stand.
- Sit down there, Sergeant.
Brax, you heard the Lieutenant. Sit down.
Your wound is open again. Let me see it.
- No, leave me be, miss.
- I will not.
Yes, you will. And if you don't mind,
I'm going to ask you to wait outside.
All right, let's have a look at the wound.
Raise up your arms.
Give us a picture what happened last night.
How many hostiles were there?
Give it to us, Brax.
We never figured to find you here.
There were 30 or 40 unshod ponies here last night before the train came in.
Their signs outback show.
They killed the stationmaster.
Thirty or 40?
There really was a big breakout.
But this wasn't Apaches, not two small caliber bullet wounds.
Did you do it, Rutledge?
I refuse to answer, sir, respectfully.
Tie him up.
Skidmore, Krump, we're going to track these hostiles down and drive them back to the reservation.
All right, move in here so you can see the map.
Three ranches have been reported burned out.
There is Jorgensons here, over here is Williards, and here's Edward Haights.
Now, the Apaches appear to be moving due west.
So we're going to go north by west fast, and cut them off before they reach the young lady's home right here at Spanish Wells.
The young lady goes with us.
Now get the terrain clear in your mind.
Rutledge, with that many hostiles loose,
I can't spare anyone to take you back to Fort Linton.
You're riding with us, too.
One hand free like the book says,
Lieutenant?
You know what the book says,
One hand free, if and when we make contact with the enemy.
How about that, Top Soldier, he ain't sending you back.
He's letting you ride with us.
Half-soldier still Top Soldier.
No, I ain't.
I'm a prisoner, now, in bad trouble.
And I ain't going to let none of this trouble rub off on you.
You're 9th Cavalrymen, and like I said, again and again, the 9th's record is going to speak for us all someday, and it's going to speak clean.
Brax, but all we're saying, we're your friends.
No, you ain't. You ain't no more.
You're not going to risk any part of this regiment's record for one man's good.
Now listen to me, Brax, and hear me well.
You tell me yourself you did that awful thing down at Fort Linton,
I wouldn't believe it.
But Brax, why did you run away?
Because I walked into something none of us can fight.
White woman business.
Now you heard your Lieutenant, Skidmore.
You get that terrain fixed in your head, because the way he talks, you're going to need it.
And don't nobody call me
Top Soldier no more.
And that's an order.
- Take the girl's bags into the lean-to.
- Yes, sir.
Mary, we're going to try to get you back to Spanish Wells.
- Have you got anything to ride in?
- Yes.
Then please get dressed.
I'm not going anywhere until
I can say goodbye to Sergeant Rutledge.
Sergeant Rutledge is riding with us.
- Wounded and handcuffed?
- That's none of your business.
And from now on
I'll have no more backtalk from you in front of my men.
McLaren, feed a quick breakfast.
We move out in 40 minutes.
Skidmore, feed the men, get the horses ready,
- we move out in 40 minutes.
- Yes, sir.
We expect you to be ready in 40 minutes,
Miss Beecher.
Sit down, Brax.
When I rode into Fort Linton last night and saw what had happened,
I couldn't believe my eyes.
It's against everything
I know about you, Brax.
You believe it now, sir, don't you?
You ran out, you deserted.
Now you refuse to make a statement.
What else you expect me to believe?
Nothing, sir.
Now, don't you play games with me, Brax.
I know you too well.
You and I served together for six years, and I know there's no better soldier in a fight.
And I thought there was no better man.
What does it all add up to, sir?
What do you think it adds up to?
Friendship, damn you.
And damn you again.
I'm trying to help you, Brax.
Stay out of it, Lieutenant.
It will smudge up any man who touches it.
You let me decide that.
What about those rib wounds?
Did Dabney fire at you first?
You can't make self-defense out of it.
There's still that dead white girl.
Nobody will believe I never touched her.
You tell me you didn't, I'll believe you.
Would you repeat that, Lieutenant?
I said to Rutledge,
You tell me you didn't, I'll believe you.
You said that, after what you seen with your own eyes
- there at Fort Linton?
- I did.
But you were the arresting officer, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.
- And you had your man in irons
- for murder, didn't you?
- I did.
Well, what did Rutledge say when you offered to believe him?
He said, Maybe you believe me, sir, but not any court-martial.
Go on with your testimony from where you told the prisoner you believe him.
Well, after that, we watered and fed the troop, and started out north by west in an attempt to cut the Apaches off before we reached Miss...
Miss Beecher home at Spanish Wells.
How's the side holding up, Sergeant?
You know what they say about us, sir, we heal fast.
You give me your word you won't try to make an escape,
I'll take the irons off you.
I can't do that, sir, because I ain't going back to stand trial.
Don't you be a fool, Brax.
What if you did get away?
Why, this thing would haunt you till you couldn't stand it.
You forget, sir, we been haunted a long time, too much to worry.
Yeah, it was all right for Mr. Lincoln to say we were free, but that ain't so. Not yet.
Maybe some day, but not yet.
All right, Rutledge.
But you make one move to get away, and I'm going to kill you.
Yes, sir.
But that's just what you'll have to do.
Troop, halt.
Vultures.
Krump, Moffat, over there.
What... What is that, Moffat?
Man staked out, and he's awful dead.
Dead, dead.
Call out, Bull Horn.
Dead man. Staked out.
Dead man. Staked out.
- My father.
- Don't jump at it, Mary.
Take it easy.
Skidmore.
There in the rock, sir.
It's a young man.
Krump, you ride back and tell Miss Beecher it isn't her father.
- Yes, sir.
- And keep her away from here.
Yes, sir.
Moffat, you got the stomach to go through his clothes for identification and personal effects, or do you want me to do it?
Somebody better.
His own mammy wouldn't recognize him.
What's going on, Corporal?
None of your business. You hush.
Don't be a-fretting, Miss.
Don't be a-fretting.
Stripped clean. Boots, gun belt, hat, even.
Nothing left but torn shirt and pants, and this tobacco sack.
- Well, who is he? Does anybody know?
- I know him, sir.
He was wearing the same Kansas City shirt last night when I was on guard duty.
That's Chris Hubble, the sutler's son.
- Chris Hubble?
- Yes, sir.
Well, what's he doing way out here?
That's a horse-killing ride.
I heard he been sparking the Jorgenson girl, sir.
Maybe when he got news of the Apache raid on her father's ranch...
Moffat, let me look at that.
Here.
Maybe you tell me what you keep looking for, sir?
Sergeant, I didn't find what I was looking for this time, either.
All right, Skidmore, 10 minutes for burial.
I know the ground's hard, but get him under as far as you can.
Yes, sir.
Whoa.
That smoke was between us and the San Rosario reservation.
Now, if this was a sport uprising designed to blood the young braves who had never known war, the chances are they would go on back to the reservation on their own.
If not?
Well, I was there to drive them back.
Avery interesting story, Lieutenant, which I don't challenge.
But I would like to call the court's attention to one all-important factor in this testimony, and that is Lieutenant Cantrell's personal interest in the accused.
And I quote from the manual for court-martial, which states,
In case of personal interest in or personal hostility toward the accused, defense counsel should apply to be relieved.
Well, now this is a hell of a time to bring that up with the trial half-over.
Excuse me, sir.
But Captain Shattuck is playing ducks and drakes with this court again.
If he would quote the text in its entirety, it begins with the words,
Defense counsel is not changeable.
All right, Lieutenant.
Read the book, Mulqueen.
Defense counsel is not changeable.
Changeable.
Over here. Hand it here. Give me the book.
- Changeable.
- All right.
Changeable...
Well, that's quite a bit different.
Mulqueen, this is a Confederate manual.
- Read the flyleaf, Colonel.
- I can read right here, it says...
Read the flyleaf, Colonel.
This manual is adopted with no changes from the manual of the United States Army.
Where you get that thing?
If it please the court,
I stole it in Atlanta the night your men burned the place, including the convent.
My specs, sir.
- Water?
- No.
- Well, Cantrell, do you wish to withdraw?
- I do not, sir.
All right, Shattuck, carry on.
Water. No, never mind.
That will be all, Lieutenant.
I call as my next witness
Sergeant Matthew Skidmore.
Skidmore. All right, take the stand.
All right, Sergeant, swear him in.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do, I do.
Your name, Sergeant?
Troop Sergeant Matthew Luke Skidmore.
Troop C, 9th United States Cavalry, sir.
Skidmore, just how old are you?
Well, sir,
I don't rightly know.
You mean you don't even know your own age?
I was slave-born.
And I saw the first steamboat come down the Mississippi River.
At least my mammy said it was the first, and she was holding me up to see.
That would make you at least 70 or more.
Mr. President, what is this line of questioning?
- Skidmore is a good soldier.
- Excellent soldier.
First-rate, Shattuck,
I suppose you have a reason for this type of questioning?
Well, sir, I was merely trying to establish the Sergeant's reliability as a witness.
- I withdraw the question.
- Get on with it.
Skidmore, the patrol report states that you pressed on after seeing the burning ranch house.
I like to hear your version of what happened then.
Well, sir, like you say, the Lieutenant forced a march trying to get the young lady home and make sure that the Apaches was headed back to the reservation.
We sent out gallopers and flankers, and we took all the necessary precautions.
- Sure leaving a sloppy, wide-open trail.
- And a slow one.
And if they're heading back for the reservation, they're taking their own sweet time about it.
Them young warriors get to showing off to one another, anything can happen.
Sir, as an old soldier...
Bugler, Moffat, circle off and take the point.
Yo.
- Keep your eyes open, Skidmore.
- Yes, sir.
- Rutledge.
- Sir.
You got the same hunch I have, sir.
- How about a weapon?
- When the time comes.
- Just like the book say?
- Just like the book say.
Attention. Right on a line.
Prepare to dismount. Dismount.
Forward skirmishes.
Company, ready.
Fire.
You ain't shooting ducks, rookie.
- Come back, Moffat.
- Come back, Moffat.
Corporal Moffat, come back.
Pull up, Moffat, pull up.
- Moffat.
- Horse running away, sir?
- Moffat.
- Moffat.
Come on. Come on.
Canteen, Brax, my canteen.
Can't give you no water, Moffat, not with that wound.
Then just let me be.
Stop that talk.
I got to get you back up to the section.
No good, Sergeant.
Hold onto me and let me down easy.
Brax. Brax.
I'm here, Moffat. I'm right here, Moffat.
My three little girls.
What's going to happen to them, Brax?
Someday, Moffat, they going to be awful proud of you.
Someday.
You're always talking about someday like it going to be a promised land here on Earth.
Brax.
We're fools to fight the white man's war.
It ain't the white man's war.
We're fighting to make us proud.
Someday your little girls...
Moffat, do you hear me? Moffat.
How is he, Rutledge?
Moffat is dead, sir.
Hold it, Rutledge.
Hold it.
- Sir.
- No.
Well, that closes our book, Miss Beecher.
We buried Trooper Moffat.
And then we followed the Apache trail toward Crazy Woman River, which we had to cross to get the young lady home.
So, here it is again.
Lieutenant Cantrell, with a record as a dead shot with all weapons that goes back to his cadet days on the Hudson, somehow missed with a service pistol at 50 yards.
A miss, mind you, that enabled his prisoner to escape.
That's all, Skidmore.
Skidmore, one moment, if you please.
Now Sergeant Skidmore, you're under oath.
Would you please tell the court in your opinion as a long-service soldier, did I deliberately miss that pistol shot?
Oh, no, sir.
When you took aim, he was a dead man.
And the second time when I tried with the carbine?
Yes, the same thing.
If the young lady hadn't...
Right, thank you very much,
Sergeant Skidmore, that's all.
Uphill, moving target, service pistol.
I might have missed him myself.
Get on with it, Shattuck.
I'm sure this court is aware that no one can tell us the rest of the story except the accused himself.
But I cannot call him.
Well, why not?
It's the duty of this court...
The accused cannot be compelled unwillingly to testify against himself.
But even so,
I am quite sure that Lieutenant Cantrell does not dare have him testify.
On the contrary, sir, the accused welcomes the opportunity to testify.
Will you call him, Captain Shattuck, or shall I?
First Sergeant Braxton Rutledge,
9th United States Cavalry.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
I like you to pick it up from where Sergeant Skidmore left it, where you had so miraculously escaped.
Lieutenant Cantrell's shots at you.
I rode full gallop for Crazy Woman River.
I figured if I could reach the upper ford and cross over,
I could follow the water north to the railroad.
After a couple of hours, the Apache trail was still leading me like they was making for the river, too.
And then I came down over the top of the river bank, and there they were.
Crossing the river fast, like they was really going someplace.
Easy, boy.
Easy, boy.
All that land a cross the river was part of Mr. Sam Beecher ranch,
Spanish Wells.
I knew then the young lady would never get home.
Not ever.
I recognized the old gentleman from the times I seen him at the fort.
It was Mr. Sam Beecher.
The young lady's father.
What happened then,
I don't like to remember.
I knew the patrol was coming up behind me, and there was the Indians ahead of me.
I had to keep going.
I had to cross over the river if I was going to break free.
I tried to tell myself what happened to the 9th Cavalry weren't no concern of mine.
I wasn't Top Soldier no more.
Now was my time to ride a way.
Ride away north, where I be free.
Miss Beecher, to the rear of the column.
To the rear.
- Ambush, sir.
- All right, get back.
Sir, like the book say?
Top Soldier back.
Stop that yelling and start shooting.
Squeeze them triggers.
Thank you, ma'am.
Take it easy, rookie.
Easy now, rookie. Easy, rookie.
And that's how it was, sir.
And we dug in on our position for the night, and did what we could for the wounded.
Now, let me get this straight, Rutledge.
What you're asking this court to believe is that, with freedom before you, you deliberately turned your back on it, and by an incredible ride and a noble disregard for your own life, you saved that patrol from annihilation.
No, sir. That ain't how I meant it, and there was nothing noble about it.
Oh, come, Rutledge, of course there was.
It was a brave act, admit it.
And I wasn't thinking brave.
Then what were you thinking?
Why did you come back? Tell us.
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
All I know, I kept riding.
And something kept telling me
I had to go back.
It was like...
It was like...
I just ain't got the words to say it.
Then I'll say it for you.
Bravery is your stock and trade, Rutledge.
Your whole record shows it.
But murderers and rapists can be as brave as decent men.
You are trying to trade your murderer's bravery for the mercy of this court, isn't that it?
No, sir. That is not...
All right, Rutledge.
If that isn't it, what was it?
It was because the 9th Cavalry was my home.
My real freedom. And my self respect.
And the way I was deserting it,
I wasn't nothing worse than a swamp-running nigger.
And I ain't that.
Do you hear me? I'm a man.
This goading of the witness is beyond belief.
Shattuck, in the name of common decency.
Decency? Stop acting like a child, Cantrell.
I'm not trying for a hanging verdict merely to whitewash this mess.
This man killed your commanding officer, admits it.
He's as guilty as hell, and you know it.
Prosecution rests.
If Sergeant Rutledge hasn't answered
Captain Shattuck's attack to the court's satisfaction,
I can only say this.
If he had not been my prisoner during the action at Crazy Woman River,
I would have cited him for gallantry above and beyond the call of duty.
Before the defense opens its argument, this court will take a brief recess.
Sergeant, open those doors, air this place out a little.
Yes, sir.
Excellent statement that Rutledge made.
Shows a fine loyal feeling for his regiment, poor devil.
And a good soldier.
I served with him myself.
I hate hangings. Bad for troop morale.
We'll have no more talk about hangings.
Incidentally, I'm glad that none of you gentlemen have mentioned the color of the man's skin.
Very well put, Mr. President.
Jacks or better?
- Size of the pot, $5.
- I'm out.
I see your five, and raise you 20.
- I'm out.
- I pass.
Give me three cards.
Cards, Mulqueen.
Mulqueen, are you bluffing again?
Ten-hut.
Order.
You men back there, get those hats off.
Put out those butts.
All right, Cantrell, proceed.
As my first witness,
I recall Miss Mary Beecher to the stand.
Mary, I called you back to the stand because I want you to tell the truth.
Now, tell exactly what happened that night at Crazy Woman...
I intend to tell the truth, no matter what you ask me.
Now, Miss Beecher, would you please tell the court what happened after the attack in the river and we had dug in for the night?
Well, it had turned bitterly cold.
And we did all we could for the wounded to make them comfortable.
And it was then that you took me aside, and told me how Sergeant Rutledge had...
Had seen my father die.
Mary, I don't know if this will be any consolation or comfort to you, but Rutledge says that your father died quickly.
Nothing like that Hubble boy.
You know, it's strange, Tom.
I can't even remember my father's face.
All I can remember is just the touch of his hand on my cheek.
Such a rough hand, oh, so gentle.
No, Tom, I hate this land.
It killed my mother, and now it killed my father.
I wish I never come back to it.
Oh, but, Mary, it's a good land.
It really is.
Maybe not now, but like Rutledge says, Someday.
Tom, you're not going to take him back now, are you?
For the first time,
I don't really know what I'm going to do.
Because you know they'll hang him if you do.
Tom, you know he never touched that girl.
I just have to think about it a little bit more, Mary.
Just a little bit more.
Who's Captain Buffalo?
Oh, he's a...
Well, when the Plains Indians first saw the troopers of the 9th Cavalry, it was in the dead of winter and they were all wearing buffalo coats to keep them warm.
They had buffalo caps on.
They looked like buffaloes.
Consequently, the Indians started calling them buffalo soldiers.
And Captain Buffalo is...
Well, he's the ideal soldier, you know.
Giant size, kind of a Paul Bunyan.
I guess they're laying it on a little thick now for Rutledge.
Try to give him confidence and cheer him up.
What a wonderful way to do it.
Too bad we couldn't take Otway back for a real military funeral.
He sure earned his 50 cents a day yesterday.
Top Soldier, you want to read burial service for Otway?
No, sir.
We're going to do it upright for him, Krump.
We're going to wait for the Lieutenant to read the words over him.
Feel all right, Skidmore?
I'll make it.
Thank you, miss.
Lieutenant will never put those irons back on you now, Top Soldier.
That's the truth, Brax.
Like I told you when he took them off, he ain't never going to put them back on you again.
Yeah. It's more like they recommended Top Soldier for the Congressional Medal of Honor.
- Ain't that so?
- That's right.
- Yeah.
- That's right.
He's right, Top Soldier.
General Nelson Handsome Miles himself will come down to pin it on you.
General Miles? That's small fry.
The President himself is going to call
Brax back to Washington just so he can shake his hand.
Top Soldier strutting into that big, blessed White House where Mr. Abraham Lincoln lives.
Brax, don't you count on going free.
The Lieutenant is a strong man for duty.
- He's got to take you back.
- No, Sergeant Skidmore.
He'll never take him back now.
Soldier can never think by his heart, ma'am.
He got to think by the book.
It's against both my oath and my duty to say this to you.
Brax, you got to go.
And you better go now.
Lieutenant's coming back.
When the burial party's finished, send them down here.
Yo.
Mary Beecher, will you come down here, please?
Krump. McClaren.
Mary, I'm sorry to have to ask you to do this, but I need a witness.
It's a little gold cross.
But what does it mean?
I'm not sure what it means.
You just remember that you saw me take it off a dead Apache.
All right.
Bring that jacket with you, too.
Well, how are you, Sergeant?
You're going to make it?
I'm ready for duty, sir.
How about our rookie here?
How're you feeling this morning?
He's a brave soldier, sir.
I's brave, but I's awful scared, too, sir.
Well, you're a good man.
In another nine or 10 years you're going to make corporal.
- The Lord's truth, sir?
- Lord's truth.
There's a mark on it, sir. C.H.
All right, Krump, you're acting platoon sergeant.
Yes, sir.
We move out for Fort Linton in 20 minutes.
Rutledge.
Tom, I thought you said last night...
Why, you cheap, contemptible, tin-plated, book soldier.
Would you mind repeating that,
Miss Beecher?
I said he was a cheap, contemptible, tin-plated, book soldier.
Thank you, Miss Beecher, you may step down.
Miss Beecher, there isn't a man in this court who didn't know and deeply respect your father, Sam Beecher.
Very fine gentleman.
Will you please accept our deepest sympathies for your loss?
Thank you.
And now, is there anything more you would like to tell this court
- before you leave this stand?
- Yes, there is.
Sergeant Rutledge saved all our lives.
And in common decency,
Lieutenant Cantrell at least owes him his.
Miss Mary Beecher has identified this cross with this broken chain, as the one I took from the dead Apache's headband.
And these 27 affidavits from the commissioned, enlisted, and civilian personnel at Fort Linton have testified that that cross is the one that was habitually worn by Lucy Dabney.
The cross which our post surgeon,
Dr. Eckner, has testified was torn from her neck.
That's correct, Doctor?
Correct.
Miss Beecher has also identified this bloodstained hunting jacket.
Now, I like to call the court's attention to the initials that have been burned into the jacket, on the inside.
The initials C.H., which are the initials of the sutler's son,
Chris Hubble...
- What's your point?
- Now, just a minute.
Whose body we found on the trail and who is the only person from whom the Apaches could have taken that cross.
Quiet. Quiet.
I'll have order in this court.
Lieutenant, if you rested your case, proceed with the summation.
Ready with summation, sir.
You now heard all the testimony of both the defense and prosecution.
And yet, neither side has been able to place before you a witness who actually saw the crimes which the accused, Sergeant Rutledge, is alleged to have committed.
Now Sergeant Rutledge has told you, of his own free will, that he entered Major Dabney's quarters.
But on urgent duty, to inform him of the Apache raids.
And that there he found the naked body of the Dabney girl strangled.
And moved by an impulse of pity and decency, he was about to cover that poor, young body with a serape when Major Dabney entered, and Dabney, in blind fury and outrage, opened fire upon him, wounding him grievously twice.
And it was then and only then, in defense of his own life, that he returned the fire, killing Major Dabney.
Now the trial judge advocate states that this is a bald-faced lie and charges rape and murder.
And the defense maintains that this story is the simple truth, and that Sergeant Rutledge's action, in defense of his own life, is justifiable homicide.
So we may say that in circumstantial evidence, this trial is deadlocked.
The scales of justice hanging in even balance, but being capable of tipped one way or the other by one iota, of just one featherweight, of direct and tangible evidence.
Now defense has introduced that evidence.
This golden cross right here and this coat.
And as much as it pains me in the presence of the young man's bereaved father, not even he can tell us where his son was that one full hour before the shots were heard.
So I maintain that there is only one possible conclusion to be reached, that Chris Hubble violated and murdered Lucy Dabney, and First Sergeant Rutledge is innocent of the crimes.
Order in this court. Silence.
Order.
Order.
Quiet, everybody.
Order.
I must deplore, as I'm sure that this court does,
Defense Counsel's cruel and clumsy attempt to shift the burden of guilt to the dead son of this heartbroken man,
Mr. Hubble.
A dead boy, unable to speak for himself now.
And to attempt to shift it, mark you, by the cheap theatrical device of this trinket.
He claims proof that the Dabney girl wore this cross around her neck.
All he has actually shown is that she wore a cross.
Most of the women of the Southwest are God-fearing women.
And a cross around their necks is not an unusual ornament.
Nor is this cross unique, unusual, or in any way in of itself identifiable.
As the contents of this box will prove to you.
I defy Defense Counsel to mix this, the original cross, with these others and then tell this court which is which.
- I object.
- Objection is not in order.
Captain Shattuck is merely meeting argument with argument.
Oh, Lieutenant, could you identify this cross if I mixed it with all these others?
You know I couldn't, sir.
He's even broke the chain on... I...
No, I couldn't.
Proceed, Captain Shattuck.
As for this coat, despite Mrs. Fosgate's testimony that she saw it at the sutler's store, it's a fairly common garment in this district.
And as for the initials C.H., the Apaches might have taken it from any of those looted, burned-out ranches.
It might have belonged to Charlie Haight.
Or to the foreman at Williards,
Clay Hagathorn.
So much for Lieutenant Cantrell's tangible, direct evidence.
I have just two more points to make, and then I shall be done.
First, at no time in these proceedings has Defense Counsel been able to convincingly explain the most damning fact of all.
If Rutledge was not guilty, why did he run?
Point number two is a delicate one.
A shadowy thing that, in a way, has hung over this court from the very start.
Well, I would like to call the court's attention to the fact that it was not I who tried to shift the guilt to a dead white boy to save this man.
It was not I who stooped to use the symbol of the cross to pin the hateful charge of rape on a dead white boy to save this man.
And finally, it was not I who tried to write the word murderer on the gravestone of that innocent white boy to salvage the life and freedom
- of this negro.
- I object.
If the color of a man's skin is to be introduced as evidence, or even argument, by this court, then I say it's this court that stands on trial, and not that soldier.
Mr. Cantrell.
This court has been very patient with you, knowing of your long service with Sergeant Rutledge, but I will not tolerate an attack upon this court's integrity.
And may I also point out to the court that in violation of all the rules and procedures,
Defense Counsel is interrupting my argument.
You may not.
Now, the one overriding rule of this court-martial, or any court-martial, is to seek out truth and administer justice, and that is exactly what we're going to do.
Take your places.
Gentlemen, in my opinion, this entire case hangs on this little cross.
Is it or is it not Lucy Dabney's?
- And on this coat.
- Sir, if it's permitted,
I think that I could pick out that cross.
Even if you mixed it with the others.
I sold it to Major Dabney for little Lucy's twelfth birthday.
There's a little nick under the crossbar that she discovered herself.
Well, damn it. He's right.
It's right there, you see?
I offered to exchange it, but Lucy said, No.
She said that way she always know it as her own.
Sir, I must object.
This is not testimony.
This man is not even under oath.
But it may be truth and justice,
Captain Shattuck.
Mr. Hubble, will you take the stand, please?
- Do I need to? I...
- Come right on up, Mr. Hubble.
It's all right, Mr. Hubble.
Sit down, please.
Sergeant, swear in the sutler.
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
- so help you God?
- I do.
All right, Captain Shattuck, according to the rules and procedures,
- you may question the witness first.
- No questions, sir.
Lieutenant Cantrell? Your witness.
Mr. Hubble, why did you tell me at Fort Linton that you could not identify Lucy's cross?
I...
It was too soon.
Chris was my son.
My only son.
It's hard for a man to admit.
It's all right. It's all right.
You take your time, collect yourself.
No...
My boy is dead.
The truth can't hurt him now.
Not anymore.
I wanted to believe it was the Sergeant.
Now I can't stand by and see him hung for something my boy did.
Would you please tell us how you think it happened?
Well, after he...
After he did the thing, he must have torn the cross off Lucy.
But why?
- Why would he do that?
- Go on, Mr. Hubble.
Well, like I told you at Fort Linton,
I was upstairs when he ran into the house.
Shouted up something about the Apache raids.
- When I came down, he was gone.
- And the coat was gone, too?
The coat? Yes.
The hunting jacket. It was gone, too?
Yes, it was.
Mr. Hubble, it was when Colonel Fosgate was about to call attention to the coat that you offered to identify the cross.
What is your first name?
They call you Chan, don't they?
- That's right, short for Chandler.
- Chandler Hubble.
C.H.
Is that Chris' coat or is it your coat?
You know, Chris was not a big man.
Won't you stand up? Let's try the coat on.
No, I never said it wasn't my coat.
Chris just grabbed the first thing.
Yes, he grabbed the first thing, and whatever was in the pockets.
And that cross was in the pocket because you put it there.
- That's not so.
- No, you had the same opportunity as Chris. You knew Lucy was going to be alone, didn't you?
- No.
- Yes, you did.
You knew Lucy was going to be alone.
And now, to save your own neck, you're trying to pin the shame of it on Chris, your own dead son.
- Lies. Lies.
- Why?
Because you knew Lucy was alone and Lucy trusted you as everybody trusted you.
You went there and strangled and killed her.
- Why?
- No. I had to.
- I had to.
- Cantrell.
Don't you understand?
Gee, the way she walked.
The way her body moved.
She drove me crazy. I had to have her.
I had to. I had to.
You know I had to.
God, help me. God, help me.
Place that man under restraint. Doctor...
Why, Mr. Hubble.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Well, go ahead, say it.
Mary, you're the most beautiful girl
I ever seen.
And don't you forget I said it to you.
Eyes left.
Front.
My story begins in London.
Not so very long ago.
And yet so much has happened since then,
that it seems more like an eternity.
At that time, I lived with my pet
in a bachelor flat just off Regent's Park.
It was a beautiful spring day,
a tedious time of the year for bachelors.
Oh. That's my pet, Roger.
Roger Radcliffe, a musician of sorts.
No. No, I'm the one with the spots.
My name's Pongo.
And you know, as far as I could see,
the old notion that a bachelor's life was so glamorous
and carefree was all nonsense.
It was downright dull.
It was plain to see that my old pet needed someone.
But if it were left up to Roger, we'd be bachelors forever.
He was married to his work. Writing songs.
Songs about romance, of all things,
something he knew absolutely nothing about.
Oh, he's intelligent enough, as humans go.
And I think you could say that Roger is a rather handsome animal in his way.
I could see no reason why my pet didn't deserve an attractive mate.
At least, I was determined to do my best.
Of course, dogs are a pretty poor judge of human beauty.
But I had a rough idea of what to look for.
Hmm. Unusual breed.
Very unusual.
Oh, surely not.
Well, now, what have we here?
Hmm.
Well, a little too short-coupled.
Nope.
I say... Oh, well I do say!
Now, there's a fancy breed.
Hmm... Perhaps a little too fancy.
Yes. That's much too fancy.
Too old.
Too young.
It was a problem. A real problem.
Well, now that's a bit more like it!
The most beautiful creature on four legs.
Oh, now, if only the girl...
Well! She's very lovely, too.
It was almost too good to be true.
I'd never find another pair like that, not if I looked for 100 years.
Ah, they're heading for the park.
A perfect meeting place, if I could only arrange it.
Uh-oh. But Roger never stopped work till after 5:00.
That would be too late.
After 5:00 already.
Fancy that.
All right, Pongo. All right, boy.
Pongo, boy, take it easy!
What's all the hurry?
Pongo, boy, slow down.
I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.
Then suddenly, I spotted them.
It was a perfect situation if I planned it right.
I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.
He'd settle on the grass, puff his pipe and that would be it.
No, it was all up to me.
Well...
At first I had no particular plan,
just anything to attract attention.
You know, stir things up a bit.
Pongo, you silly old thing! Come on.
Come on, let's have it, boy.
Pongo!
Pongo!
For a while, it seemed to work.
At least they had seen one another.
Things were going along first-rate.
But for some strange reason they left!
Come on, you old renegade.
We're going home.
But I wasn't giving up.
I was determined that, somehow, they just had to meet.
- Oh!
- Oh!
I beg your pardon. I'm so sorry. Please excuse me.
- I must say, what on earth!
- Oh, dear!
Oh, really. Good heavens. Of all the...
- Oh!
- Ah!
Oh, my new spring suit and my new hat!
I'm terribly sorry.
Please let me help you.
I'm so sorry. Pongo, you...
I don't know what's come over him.
I'm terribly sorry. He's never acted this way before.
Never mind. Never mind.
Please, just go away.
You've done enough.
Please? Oh.
Oh, I say. Here, take mine.
Oh.
Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her in sickness and in health, and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto her so long as ye both shall live?
I will.
For the first six months or so,
we lived in a small house near the park,
a modest little place,
but just right for two couples who were just starting out.
Perdita, darling, are you all right?
Oh, of course, dear.
After all, dogs were having puppies long before our time.
Oh, that's Nanny, a wonderful cook and housekeeper.
She's such a kind, understanding soul.
You know,
at times she seems almost canine.
Roger, dear, tea time.
Tea time!
Be down in a minute
Do you like my new song?
- Such clever lyrics.
- Melody first, my dear.
And then the lyrics, hmm?
Oh, Pongo, it's her.
It's that devil woman.
Oh, must be Cruella, your dearly devoted old school mate.
Cruella De Vil.
That's it!
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De Vil
If she doesn't scare you no evil thing will
Oh, Roger.
To see her is to take a sudden chill
Oh!
Cruella
She's like a spider waiting for the kill
Roger, she'll hear you.
Look out for Cruella De Vil
Let her in, Nanny.
- Anita, darling!
- How are you?
Miserable as usual.
Perfectly wretched!
Where are they? Where are they?
For heaven sakes, where are they?
- Who, Cruella?
- The puppies! The puppies.
No time for games. Where are the little brutes?
It'll be at least three weeks.
No rushing these things.
Anita, you're such a wit.
Here, dog, here.
Here, dog.
Cruella, isn't that a new fur coat?
My only true love, darling.
I live for furs. I worship furs!
After all, is there a woman in this wretched world who doesn't?
Oh, I'd like a nice fur, but there are many other things...
Sweet, simple Anita.
I know, I know!
This horrid little house is your dream castle.
And poor Roger is your bold and fearless Sir Galahad!
Oh, Cruella.
Then of course you have your little spotted friends.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I must say, such perfectly beautiful coats.
- Won't you have some tea?
- I've got to run.
Let me know when the puppies arrive.
- You will, won't you, dear?
- Yes, Cruella.
Don't forget, it's a promise.
See you in three weeks. Cheerio.
Cheerio, darling.
Oh!
At first you think
Cruella is a devil
But after time has worn away the shock
You come to realise
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
You're no help.
This vampire bat
This inhuman beast
She ought to be locked up and never released
The world was such a wholesome place until
Cruella
Cruella De Vil
Roger, you are an idiot!
- Perdy?
- That witch. That devil woman.
She wants our puppies.
That's all she's after.
Don't worry, Perdy.
They're on to her.
Nothing's going to happen to our puppies.
What does she want with them?
She can't possibly love them.
Oh, Pongo.
I was so happy at first, but now I...
Oh, I...
I wish we weren't having any.
Poor Perdita. Of course, she had no choice.
The puppies arrived right on schedule,
one wild and stormy night in October.
Steady, boy.
The puppies are here!
Oh, the puppies are here!
How many?
- Eight.
- Eight?
By George, Pongo! Eight puppies.
Ten.
- Eleven.
- Eleven.
Eleven? Eleven puppies, Pongo, boy.
Wait a minute now, wait a minute, 13!
No, no, no. Fourteen.
- Oh, 15!
- Fifteen?
And the mother's doing fine, love.
You ducky thing, you.
Fifteen puppies?
Why, Pongo, that's marvellous!
It's fabulous!
Why, you old rascal!
Fourteen.
Just 14.
We lost one.
Oh, poor little thing.
Oh, Pongo, boy.
It's just one of those things.
And yet...
And yet I wonder.
Look, Pongo.
Anita!
Nanny. Fifteen!
We still have 15!
Oh, Roger, he's all right!
Thank heaven.
See? He's just as good as new.
Can you imagine, Roger, 15 puppies!
Fifteen. Fifteen puppies!
How marvellous.
How marvellous, how perfectly... Ugh!
The devil take it. They're mongrels, no spots!
No spots at all. What a horrid little white rat.
They're not mongrels!
They'll get their spots.
Just wait and see.
That's right. They'll have their spots in a few weeks.
Oh, well, in that case I'll take them all. The whole litter.
Just name your price, dear.
I'm afraid we can't give them up.
- Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous.
You can't afford to keep them.
You can scarcely afford to feed yourselves.
I'm sure we'll get along.
Yes, I know. I know!
Roger's... Roger's songs!
Enough of this nonsense. I'll pay you twice what they're worth.
Come now, I'm being more than generous.
Blast this pen.
Blast this wretched, wretched pen! Ah!
When can the puppies leave their mother?
Two weeks? Three weeks?
Never.
- What?
- We're not selling the puppies.
Not a single one.
Do you understand?
Anita, is he serious?
I really don't know Roger.
- Cruella, he seems...
- Surely he must be joking!
No, no, no. I mean it.
You're, you're not getting one. Not one.
And that's final.
Why, you horrid man!
You... You...
All right, keep the little beasts for all I care.
Do as you like with them.
Drown them!
But I warn you, Anita, We're through.
I'm through with all of you!
I'll get even. Just wait.
You'll be sorry, you fools!
You idiots!
Oh, Roger! You were magnificent, darling.
He was a bloomin' hero, ma'am!
Indeed he was. A bloomin' hero!
Perdy? Perdy, darling?
We're keeping the puppies, every single one of them.
My ol' pet Roger, he told that devil woman off.
He told her off, Perdy. She's gone.
- Darling, she's gone for good.
- Oh, Pongo.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
Go get him, Thunder.
After him, boy.
He'll get that dirty ol' horse thief.
Old Thunderbolt's the greatest dog in the whole world.
He's even better than Dad.
No dog's better than Dad.
What's he going to do, Dad?
Shh. Shh. Let's just wait and see.
Look at him run, the old coward.
That old dirty Dawson!
The yellow-livered old skunk!
I'd like to tear his gizzard out.
Why, Patch, where did you ever hear such talk?
Certainly not from your mother.
- Watch out, Thunder.
- Don't worry, Penny.
He'll get that yellow-livered...
Well, he'll get him, all right.
Lucky, get down. We can't see. Get down.
Mother, make him get down.
Come on, Lucky. Down, dear.
Missed him. Missed him by a mile.
I'm hungry, mother. I'm hungry.
Now, Rolly, you've just had your dinner.
But I am, just the same.
I'm so hungry I could eat a whole elephant.
Shh!
There he is, behind that rock.
Oh, dear. He shot poor Thunder.
He missed him. Ol' Thunder's pretending, I think.
See? What did I tell you?
That's one of his tricks.
Lucky, get down.
I'm hungry, Mother. I really am.
Don't miss next week's episode. Who will triumph?
Ol' Thunder always wins!
And speaking of champions, friends,
Kanine Krunchies is the champion of all dog biscuits.
Kanine Krunchies can't be beat
They make each meal a special treat
Happy dogs are those who eat nutritious Kanine Krunchies
Perdy, we better get these little nippers off to bed if we're going for a W-A-L-K.
- We want to go, too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?
We never get to go.
Come along, children. Bedtime.
But we're not a... bit sleepy.
We want to go for a walk in the park.
- Dad, can we?
- Better do as your mother says.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13...
I'm not sleepy. I'm hungry.
Fourteen.
Hmm?
So do what all the smart dogs do
And you'll feel great the whole day through
You can be a champion, too if you eat Kanine Krunchies
Remember, friends, just send five...
Lucky, you little rascal, let's go.
There they go, Horace, me lad, out for their evening constitutional.
Oh. A lovely pair of turtledoves.
Around the Johnny Horner and off to the park.
Yeah, I don't like it, Jasper.
One more pinch and they'll throw the keys away.
Oh, come off it, Horace. We're getting plenty of boodle.
Yes, but I've been thinkin'.
You've been thinkin'?
I warned you about thinkin'.
I've got the knob for this job, so let's get on with it.
Ah, nobody home but the little ol' cook.
You just leave her to ol' Jasper.
He can handle her real diplomatic-like.
Yeah, but I still don't like it.
Here, here. Patch, you settle down.
Oh, dear.
Go to sleep now.
Close your little eyes.
That's a good little one.
Who do you suppose?
Good evening, ma'am.
We're here to inspect the wiring and the switches.
- We're from the gas company.
- Electric, electric.
Electric company.
But we didn't call for any inspection.
Yes, I know. See, there's a new act just been passed in Parliament.
Under the heading of the "Defence of the
Realm Act." Article four, section 29.
It's a law. And it's for your own safety, ma'am.
I don't care what Parliament
Realm or whatever it is says.
You're not coming in here, not with the Mister and Missus gone.
Oh, now. Come off it, Ducky.
We got no time to palaver.
We got a job to do. Excuse me!
What's the matter with you two?
You got cloth ears? I said you're not coming in here!
- Oh!
- Oh-ho-ho!
She's a regular little tartar, ain't she, Horace?
Don't you dare go up there, you big, long-legged lummox!
Now I mean it.
If you don't get out of this house,
I'll call the police, I will.
Now be off with you, you big weasel!
Now you've been gone and done it.
You've cut me to the quick, lady.
Why, I wouldn't stay here if you asked me.
Not even for a cup of tea.
Oy! Horace, me lad, I've got a sneaky suspicion we're not welcome here.
Pack up. We're leaving.
Sharp's the word and quick's the action.
Let me out! Help!
I'll call the police. Help!
Goodnight, Ducky. Ta-ta!
Those good-for-nothing hoodlums!
Electric company. Hmph!
Nothing but common sneak thieves.
I'll bet they made off with the good silver.
Why, I'll bet they took every last...
The puppies!
The puppies! They're gone!
Patch? Lucky? Rolly?
Oh! They took the puppies!
Oh, whatever will I do?
Those scoundrels!
They stole the puppies.
Police? Help! The puppies.
Police! Somebody help me!
Help! Help! Help!
"Dognapping!" Tsk-tsk. Can you imagine such a thing?
"15 puppies stolen." They are darling little things.
Anita and her...
And her bashful Beethoven!
Pipe and all!
Oh, Roger, you are a fool!
Hello?
Jasper! Jasper, you idiot!
How dare you call here?
We don't want no more of this, we want our boodle!
We'll settle for half!
Not one shilling 'till the job's done.
- Jasper! Jasper!
- Do you understand?
It's in the blinkin' papers, pictures and all!
Hang the papers! It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
- I don't like it.
- Shut up, you idiot!
What?
Not you, miss. I mean Horace!
Why, you imbecile!
Maybe Scotland Yard.
Maybe they found something.
Hello, Inspector?
- Is Anita there?
- Who?
- Anita!
- It's for you.
- Hello?
- Anita, darling.
- Oh. Cruella.
- Oh, Anita.
What a dreadful thing.
I just saw the papers.
I couldn't believe it.
Yes, Cruella. It was quite a shock.
- Is she calling to confess?
- Roger, please!
She's a sly one.
We're doing everything possible.
- Have you called the police?
- Yes, Scotland Yard.
- But I'm afraid...
- Where are they?
You idiot!
- Anita!
- Sorry, Cruella.
Yes. If there's any news, we'll let you know.
Thank you, Cruella.
Roger, I admit she's eccentric, but she's not a thief.
She's still number one suspect in my book!
She's been investigated by Scotland Yard.
- What more do you want?
- I don't know, darling.
I don't know.
Oh, Rog. What'll we do?
What'll we do?
Perdy, I'm afraid it's all up to us.
Oh, Pongo. Isn't there any hope?
Well, yes. There's the twilight bark.
The twilight bark? That's only a gossip chain.
Darling, it's the very fastest way to send news.
If our puppies are anywhere in the city, the London dogs will know.
We'll send the word tonight when our pets take us for a walk in the park.
There's no one out tonight.
I'm afraid it's too cold.
We've got to keep trying, Perdy.
Perdy, we're in luck!
It's the Great Dane at Hampstead.
Pongo. Quiet, boy!
Do you want to stir up the whole neighbourhood? Come on. Pongo.
- Perdy, come on!
- Let's go.
Pongo, you old idiot!
Come on, now. We're going home!
What is it, Danny?
Who's on the telegraph?
It's Pongo, Regent's Park!
It's an all-dog alert.
What's it all about? What's the word?
Tell me, Danny! Tell me, tell me!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Well, now... Hmm, that is something.
What, Danny? What's something?
Fifteen Dalmatian puppies, stolen!
Have they called the police?
Scotland Yard?
The humans tried everything.
Now it's up to us dogs and the twilight bark.
I'll sound the alert!
Prissy, come in here!
Coco!
Be quiet now!
Ah, shut up!
Quiet!
Will you be quiet!
Towser, what's going on?
What is it? What's all the gossip?
'Tain't no gossip, Lucy. It be all the way from London.
- You don't say!
- Fifteen puppies stolen.
There's no puppies around here, not since Nellie's last litter.
And they're all grown up.
Well, then, we'd best send the word along.
It be up to me to reach the Colonel!
He be the only one in barking range.
You'll never reach him at this hour!
Well, I can try!
I'll bark all night if I have to.
Hmm...
Hmm... Sounds like old Towser.
It's an alert. Sergeant!
Sergeant Tibs! I say, Sergeant!
Oh, yes, Captain!
Barking signal. It's an alert.
Report to the Colonel at once.
Yes, sir. Right-o, sir.
Right away, sir!
Colonel?
I say, Colonel!
Colonel, sir? Colonel?
- Colonel?
- What? Who goes there?
Sergeant Tibs reporting, sir.
- Tibs? Tibs? Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs!
- Colonel, sir...
Look here, Tibs. What's the idea of barging in at this hour?
- But Colonel...
- Hold on, Sergeant.
You hear that?
- Sounds like an alert.
- Yes, Colonel.
We'd better look into it.
Come along, on the double.
Right-o, sir.
It's old Towser down at Withermarsh, sir.
By Jove, yes! So it is. Hmm.
Well, I'll see what he wants. it be the Colonel.
The old boy himself!
He wants the message.
You'd better make it loud and clear or he'll never get it.
One long howl, two short.
- One yip and a woof.
- Two yips, sir.
- What's the word, Colonel?
- It's from London.
Then it must be important.
Yes, yes, I'll get the rest of it.
Sounds like a number.
Three fives are 13...
That's 15, sir.
Fifteen, of course 15.
Yes, dot, spot, spotted puddings, poodles...
No, no, puddles.
Puddles, sir?
Fifteen spotted puddles stolen.
Oh, balderdash.
Better double check it, Colonel.
Oh, yes, yes, I suppose I better.
Two woofs, one yip and a woof.
It sounds like puppies, sir.
Of course, puppies.
Colonel, Colonel, sir,
I just remembered.
Two nights past I heard puppy barking over at Hell Hall.
You mean the old De Vil place?
Nonsense, Tibs! No one's lived there for years.
Hold on! There's smoke coming from the chimney!
By Jove, that's strange, strange indeed.
I suppose we'd better investigate.
I'll send word for ol'
Towser to stand by.
Please stand by.
- What's he mean by that?
- I don't know.
Oh, maybe the ol' boy's found something!
Oh, I do hope so.
They say the ol' place is haunted or bewitched or some such fiddle-faddle.
Fiddle-faddle and rot, sir.
Just the same, use extreme caution.
No telling what sort of hocus-pocus you might run into.
Blast it all, Tibs.
On the double, man.
- On the double.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Psst!
- Rover. Spotty.
- Hmm. What?
Are you one of the
15 stolen puppies?
No, we're not stolen.
We're bought and paid for.
There's 99 of us all together.
Ninety-nine!
How 'bout that bunch of little ones?
They have names and collars.
They're not from the pet shops.
- Fifteen of 'em.
- We never counted them.
They're over there by the TV.
- I'd better count 'em.
- Watch out for the Baduns.
Baduns?
Those two blokes,
Horace and Jasper.
They're mean ones, they are.
Hey, look, Horace!
Watch me pot His Lordship smack on the conk.
How's that for calling 'em, eh?
One, two,
- three, four, five, six...
- Hey, Jasper.
Come on, now, give us a swig, just a short one.
Now, Horace, this hogwash ain't fit for a fancy bloke like yourself.
Besides, you'd get crumbs in it, you cabbage head!
All right.
Guzzle the whole works. I hope it gives you collywobbles, that's what.
Hey, Jasper. Did you...
Let me see. Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...
Hey, get down, you runt!
And stay down!
Go on, get out of here or I'll black your other peeper.
Where was I? Nine...
Nine, three more.
Twelve and... One, two, three. That's 15!
They're the ones!
Blimey!
What the...
Horace, look what we got! A tabby cat!
How'd you like a tabby cat stew?
Or a cat casserole?
À la mode.
- What is it, Pongo? What is it?
- Shh. It's the Great Dane.
He has news for us. He'll meet us at Primrose Hill.
- How'll we get out?
- Uh, the back bedroom window.
It's always open a wee bit. Come on.
Pongos, you've made it. Good.
- What's the word? What's the news?
- Have they found our puppies?
They've been located somewhere north of here,
- in Suffolk.
- Oh, thank heaven.
- Can you leave tonight?
- We can leave right away.
I'll go along as far as Camden
Road and give you instructions.
When you reach Withermarsh, contact old Towser.
He'll direct you to the Colonel and the Colonel will take you to your puppies at the De Vil place.
- De Vil!
- The De Vil place!
Oh, Pongo, it was her!
Oh, someone you know?
Sorry, sir. There's no time to explain.
Oh, I hope we're not too late.
Good luck, Pongos.
If you lose your way, contact the barking chain.
They'll be standing by!
Any news, Colonel?
Not a blasted thing.
They're lost or captured, or something or other.
- Who knows what.
- Colonel, here comes a car.
Come now, Tibs.
Don't be ridiculous.
- They wouldn't be driving.
- Yes, I know, sir.
But it's heading for Hell Hall.
It's stopping at the gate!
It is? Blast it all!
Better see what's up.
- On the double, man. On the double!
- Yes, sir.
Take over, Captain.
Right-o, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr Simpkins.
The answer's no, no, no.
Six down, four to go.
I've got no time to argue.
It's got to be done tonight.
It must be a yes or no question, Inspector.
Do you understand? Tonight!
But they ain't big enough.
You couldn't get half a dozen coats out of the whole caboodle.
Coats! Dog-skin coats?
Then we'll settle for half a dozen! We can't wait.
The police are everywhere.
I want the job done tonight!
How're we gonna do it?
Any way you like. Poison them, drown them.
Bash them in the head.
You got any chloroform?
- Not a drop.
- And no ether, ei-ther.
Eye-ther!
I don't care how you kill the little beasts, but do it, and do it now!
Aw, please, miss. Have pity.
Can't we see the rest of the show first?
We want to see What's My Crime?
Listen, you idiots!
I'll be back in the morning.
The job better be done, or I'll call the police!
Do you understand?
I think she means it.
Ah... We'll get on with it, as soon as the show's over.
Will you please sign in, sir?
You'd better get out of here if you want to save your skins.
- But how?
- Shh.
There's a hole in the wall there by the door.
Come on, shake a leg.
Psst! Kids, follow me.
Hey, Jasper, look!
It's old Meathead.
Yeah, what do you know, old Meathead Fauncewater.
Come on, don't crowd.
One at a time. One at a time!
For our last contestant,
meet Mr Percival Fauncewater.
If the panel fails to guess your unusual crime in ten questions,
you will receive two weeks vacation at a seaside resort,
all expenses paid.
That is, after you've paid your debt to society.
Who will take the first question? Inspector?
Mr Fauncewater, could your crime be classified as larceny?
- A theft, burglary?
- Straighten out!
Form a queue, along the wall.
Come on. Snap it up, faster.
Mr Fauncewater is a burglar by trade, but in this case,
his crime was not burglary.
I'm sorry, the answer's no. One down, nine to go. Miss Birdwell?
If your crime wasn't robbery, did you,
oh, dear, what I mean is,
do something of a violent nature, that is...
Come, Miss Birdwell, we're running short of time.
So sorry. Did you do someone in?
No, Miss Birdwell, I'm sorry.
The answer is no.
Two down, eight to go.
- Mr Simpkins?
- Psst!
Hey, kid, let's go.
Could it be a violation of a city ordinance?
Uh, no. The answer is...
Hey, get out of the way, you little runt!
Three down, seven to go. Inspector?
Very confusing, I must say.
Surely, this crime could...
I'm terribly sorry.
We've run out of time.
Ain't that always the way!
Would it be possible for Mr Fauncewater
to come back next week?
Then we could finish our little game.
Good night, audience. See you next week at this same time on What's My Crime?
Ah. Oh, well.
Come on, Horace.
Let's get on with it.
I'll pop 'em on the head, you do the skinnin'.
No, you don't, Jasper!
I'll pop 'em off and you do the skinnin'.
Horace, look!
They're gone. They flew the coop, right out through this hole.
Here, grab a torch.
We'll run 'em down before you can say "Bob's your uncle."
There they go, Horace, up the stairs.
Here, puppies.
Here, puppies! Come on now.
Don't go hiding from ol' Uncle Jasper.
Oh, I ain't gonna hurt ya.
I thought we was gonna pop 'em off.
Shh! Shut up.
Take a squint in there. I'll check these other two rooms.
Here, puppies.
Puppies, come on out. Come out wherever you are.
Horace! Ooh!
It's that mangy tabby cat!
He's the ringleader!
Head 'em off, Horace! Head 'em...
You bungling blockhead!
Back here! Back here!
Shh! Here they come.
Double-crossin' little twerps, pulling a snitch on us!
After we took care of 'em.
There's gratitude for you.
It ain't fair, Jasper.
Horace, there they go!
Sergeant? I say, Sergeant.
No time to explain. Busy, sir.
Shut that door, Horace!
We'll close in on 'em. Enough of this Ring Around the Rosy.
Oh, Pongo, I'm afraid we're lost.
It can't be far.
By Jove! It can't be the Pongos.
It's the Colonel. This way.
Colonel? Are you the Colonel?
Oh, Pingo! Pongo?
Our puppies, are they all right?
No time to explain.
There's trouble.
A big hullabaloo. Come along!
Follow me!
Now we've got 'em, Horace.
They've run out of room.
What have we got here?
A couple of spotted hyenas?
Come on, Horace. Give 'em what for.
I'm right behind ya, lad.
Oh!
You clumsy clod!
Hey! I'll knock the spots off you. Let go!
Let go!
Well, by George!
You mangy mongrel!
I'll knock your blinkin' block off.
Blast 'em, Tibs. Give 'em what for.
No, Colonel. Retreat, retreat!
Yes. Yes, of course. Retreat!
Retreat, on the double!
Help, Jasper! Get me out of here!
Horace, they're fighting dirty!
Oh!
Jasper!
Horace!
Come on, Perdy. Let's go.
I'll skin every one of them spotted hyenas if it's the last thing I do.
Dad! Mother!
- I missed you, Mommy.
- Here we are, Mommy.
Oh, my darlings, my darlings!
How'd you find us, Dad?
Lucky, Patch, Pepper!
Hi, Freckles.
Oh, Daddy.
And Rolly, you rascal!
Did you bring me anything to eat?
Everybody here? All 15?
Twice that many, Dad.
Now there's 99 of us!
What? Ninety-nine?
Where did they all come from?
What would she want with so many?
She's gonna make coats out of us.
- She couldn't!
- That's right, dog-skin coats.
Oh, dog-skin coats! Come now, Tibs!
But it's true, sir.
Horace and Jasper were gonna pop us off and skin us!
She's a devil, a witch!
What'll we do?
We have to get back to London somehow.
What about the others?
What'll they do?
Perdy, we'll take them home with us, all of them.
Our pets would never turn them out.
Colonel, sir, lights on the road.
It's a truck headin' this way.
It's the Baduns, Horace and Jasper.
They're following our tracks.
We've got 'em outnumbered, Tibs.
When I give the signal, we'll attack.
Colonel, sir, I'm afraid that would be disastrous.
Oh, you think so?
He's right. We'd better run for it.
Out the back way, across the pasture.
Thank you, Sergeant,
Colonel, Captain.
- Bless you all.
- How can we ever repay you?
Nothing at all. All in the line of duty.
That's right, sir, routine.
Better be off. Here they come.
Come on, kids, hurry.
- Good luck, Pongos.
- And never fear.
We'll hold them off
'til the bitter end.
Now, what's this?
Out of my way, you barkin' haystack.
Or I'll knock your blinkin' block off!
They ain't in here, Jasper.
They're hiding in the hay.
Give me a match.
We'll burn 'em out.
Ready, Captain. Aim.
Fire one.
Fire two.
Hey, there they go, the little sneaks.
Come on, back to the truck.
We'll head 'em off in half a mile.
They gotta be around here somewhere.
- I've been thinkin'.
- Now, Horace.
What if they went down the froze-up creek, so's not to leave their tracks?
Horace, you idiot!
Dogs ain't that smart.
All clear, Perdy.
- All clear.
- We gave 'em the slip! Didn't we, Dad?
They didn't even see us, Patch!
Shh, children. Children, shh.
My feet are slippery.
I wish we could walk on the snow.
No, son, we can't leave tracks.
Well, any sign of them?
Not so much as one bloomin' footprint.
And we've been up and down every road in the county.
We're froze stiff. We're givin' up.
Oh, no, you don't!
We'll find the little mongrels if it takes till next Christmas.
Now get going! Watch your driving, you imbeciles! Do you wanna get nabbed by the police?
Ninety-three,
Oh, Lucky!
Come on, Lucky, boy.
We can't give up now.
I'm tired and I'm hungry and my tail's froze, and my nose is froze and my ears are froze.
And my toes are froze.
Pongo!
Pongo! Pongo!
We'd just about lost hope.
We have shelter for you, at the dairy barn across the road.
Oh, thank goodness.
Perdy! Perdy!
This way, Perdy.
- The dairy barn across the road.
- Come on, kids.
It's not far. Come on, this way. Follow the collie.
Just look, Queenie.
- Have you ever seen so many puppies?
- Aren't they adorable!
- Perfectly darling.
- The poor little dears.
They're completely worn out and half frozen!
They all here, Pongo?
Yes, dear. All 99 accounted for.
The famous Pongos. We were so worried about you.
Been trying to reach you.
Afraid you'd been captured.
How did you make it all this way?
- And in such dreadful weather.
- With all those little ones.
I'm hungry, Mother. I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry, too.
- Mother, we're hungry.
- We're all hungry.
- I'm sorry, children.
Do they like warm milk? It's fresh.
- Where is it?
- Where is the milk?
Come and get it, kids.
It's on the house.
This way, children.
Around this way.
Don't crowd. You'll have to take turns.
Rolly, wait your turn, dear.
Don't worry, kids.
There's plenty for all.
Ooh! The little darlings.
Pongo, a few scraps I saved
- for you and the missus.
- Oh, thank you.
It's not much, but it might hold you as far as Dinsford.
Huh? Dinsford?
There's a Labrador there.
His pet is a grocer.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Quite all right.
Get some rest and don't worry.
I'll be standing watch.
I don't know what we'd have done if...
- We're very honoured to be of service.
- We're only sorry we can't do more.
Anyone who would think of hurting these dear little puppies...
- Shh! Duchess!
- They're so dear.
I wish they could stay with us for always.
Princess, shh! Quiet, everyone.
Let them sleep, the poor things.
They're so exhausted and they still have such a long way to go.
Hurry, kids. Hurry!
Well now, what have we here?
Well, so they thought they could outwit Cruella.
Jasper! Horace!
Here's their tracks heading straight for the village.
Blimey! Oh, it's them, all right.
Work your way south on the side roads. I'll take the main road.
See you in Dinsford!
Pongo, I've got a ride home for you.
A ride home? Perdy, did you hear that?
For all of us?
You mean we don't have to walk any more?
If we can manage it.
Come on. We'd better hurry.
We've got a ride home!
Come on, children.
See the van down the street?
It's going to London as soon as the engine's repaired.
And there's room for all of you.
Pongo, there's Cruella.
Yes, and Jasper and Horace.
Pongo, how will we get to the van?
I don't know, Perdy.
But somehow we've got to.
Mother, Dad,
- Patch pushed me in the fireplace.
- Lucky pushed me first.
- Did not. Did not.
- Did, too. Did, too.
Did not!
- Please, children, don't quarrel.
- Say...
Perdy, I've got an idea.
Pongo, what on earth...
Look, I'm a Labrador!
We'll all roll in soot.
We'll be Labradors.
Say, that is an idea!
Come on, kids! Roll in the soot.
You mean, you want us to get dirty?
Did you hear that, Freckles?
Dad wants us to get dirty.
- Mother, should we?
- Do as your father says.
- This'll be fun.
- I always wanted to get good and dirty.
That's the stuff. The blacker the better.
- I'm ready.
- Me, too.
How's this, Dad?
Wait. That's enough. Not too many at a time.
Uh-oh. Rolly, hold on.
You're only half done.
Now, stay right with me.
We're gonna fool the ol' mad lady.
Pongo.
I'm so afraid.
Look, Jasper.
Do you suppose they disguised themselves?
Say now, Horace. That's just what they did.
Dogs is always painting theirselves black!
You idiot!
Well, so far so good.
Come on, Perdy. Better get on your make-up.
I'll go ahead with the next bunch.
Jasper! Horace!
- Well?
- Aw, now be reasonable, miss.
We're froze clean to our bones.
We've been out all night and all day, with nothin' to eat.
They're somewhere in this village, and we're going to find them.
Now get swing!
Do you think they've seen us?
No, but we're running out of time.
Try 'er again, mate.
Hurry, Perdy. The van's about to leave.
Better hurry.
I'll get the rest.
That ought to do her. She'll get you back to London.
Better get aboard, miss.
Hey, Jasper.
Come on, Horace.
Hurry, kids!
Come on, kids. Run on ahead.
- She's watching us, Dad.
- Keep going.
It can't be!
It's impossible!
Run for it!
Jasper! Horace!
Jasper!
There they go! In the van.
After them! After them!
Pongo! There she is, Cruella.
Hey, lady, what in thunder are you tryin' to do?
Crazy woman driver!
Pongo, look!
Jasper!
Ain't nothin' to it.
I'll give him a nudge and shove him in the dirt.
Perdy, watch out!
- Jasper!
- Horace!
You idiots!
You fools!
You imbeciles!
Ah, shut up!
You've seen her kind of eyes
Watching you from underneath a rock
Cruella De Vil
Cruella De
Roger, after all, that's your first big hit.
It's made more money than we ever dreamed of.
Yes, I know.
I still can't believe that Pongo and Perdy would run away.
Here's a bit of Christmas cheer for you, if there's anything to be cheerful about.
Oh, the dear little things.
Sometimes at night I can hear them barking.
But it always turns out I'm dreaming.
Roger, what on earth...
They're Labradors!
No, no. They're covered with soot.
Look, here's Lucky!
Pongo, boy, is that you?
Oh, Pongo, Pongo!
Ho-ho, it's Pongo!
And Perdy, my darling.
And Patch, and Rolly, and Penny, and Freckles.
They're all here, the little dears.
- It's a miracle!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!
And look, there's a whole lot more!
Look, Anita, puppies everywhere.
There must be 100!
One, two, three and four, is seven.
Two, four, six, and three is nine, plus two is 11.
- Thirty-six over here.
- Thirty-six and 11, that's 47!
- Eighteen, Roger.
- That's 65!
Ten, 11, 12, 13!
Wait a minute, six more.
Let's see, that's 84.
And 15 plus two, 101!
A hundred and one? Where did they come from?
Oh, Pongo, you old rascal!
- What'll we do with them?
- We'll keep 'em.
- In this little house?
- We'll buy a big place in the country.
We'll have a plantation, a Dalmatian plantation.
Roger, that's truly an inspiration.
It'll be a sensation!
We'll have a Dalmatian plantation.
A Dalmatian plantation, I say.
We'll have a dalmatian plantation
Where our population can roam
- I'm hungry, mother.
- In this new location
Our whole aggregation
Will love our plantation home
Dalmatian plantation home
- Where is the meeting?
- In the... church.
Is Quintero with them?
Yes.
Columnal Derechal
(in Spanish) Forward!
Senor Quintero...
...for three years, they have heard nothing but talk.
Now, when are we going to do something?
When are we going to get the soldiers off our necks?
Soon, my friend.
Soon. But first, we must grow strong.
In one week I go to Sonora to meet with the revolutionary council.
If I can show them the support of the people...
...and the young fighters in the hills...
...they promise that the generals sympathetic to our cause...
...will come over to our side.
The presidente will run before our strength.
Then you will be free to live as men, and not as animals.
- And what about Lobero?
- He is a bandit and a thief.
It's hard to respect the law when you feel the heel of its boot on your back.
I'm not sure that what Lobero wants from the revolution is the same as we want.
But he says he wants to help.
And he has many guns.
Do you trust him?
Only his guns.
For the revolution I would make a bargain with the devil...
...so why not with Lobero?
Let him join us. Perhaps, after we win, he will change.
Oh. It is time for me to go.
Senor Quintero.
Please, be careful, huh?
You took a big chance just coming here.
In these days, one takes a chance every time he wakes up in the morning.
Quintero! We are waiting!
It's Diego. They're all over the place.
Benito?
- Is he dead?
- He's dead.
- I told you we should have brought guns.
- Guns? What guns?
(Diego) Quintero!
It is useless to resist.
We must wait for our time.
Take this. It will help.
Somehow, I don't know how...
...we will be together, eh?
If I live.
You will live.
(Diego) Quintero!
I do not like to be kept waiting!
Look at your leader.
El palomito. The little dove who would be an eagle!
Take a good look.
You will not see him again.
This... this is who you follow, but you go nowhere.
He talks... oh, how he talks, but he does not fight.
Must we teach you again and again - to resist the president only brings death?
Will you never learn?
Tie them up.
They have done nothing.
Why make them suffer because of me?
Perhaps you are right. They do nothing on the farms. They will do nothing in prison.
We are short on rations, so why feed stupid mouths?
Lobero.
(in Spanish) Lobero.
Wake up, man. Lobero.
- It's me, Maximiliano.
- Hm?
- What happened?
- Quintero's been captured.
Argh!
The little dove is in the rathole!
I told you not to let him come.
Nobody listens to Lobero.
Now we will have to get him out.
Tomorrow.
But every time we do, we don't.
But every time we do, we don't what?
Every time we go in, we don't come back.
Two brothers I have lost, trying to get your uncle out.
He's right, Lobero.
We're going to need some help.
Need help... I have men. I have guns.
- That's not enough.
- It's not enough?
- You have a plan?
- I know someone who can help us.
Someone who can help us.
Who is this great genius, this great man?
I have never seen him. All I know is that he's a friend and his name is Chris.
And he will help us because he love us?
- No, no. For money.
- For money?
- How much money?
- American?
- American.
You have the money?
What do you think, Miguel?
- I think...
- Ah! I don't care what you think.
OK. All right.
Maximiliano...
...you go, but you better come back...
...with the cannons and the guns and the dynamite and the whole shooting match.
Hang him!
You got anything to say, stranger?
I said it all at my trial.
You didn't believe me then.
String him up! Kill the horse thief!
You, uh... you wanna know my name before you hang me?
Not particularly. Just your last words.
- I demand a re-count.
- We've been all through that before.
It was your word against the Garrett boys, three of the finest men I know...
...born and bred right here in this town.
Three of the finest liars you know?
Stealing a man's horse in this country is worse than stealing his wife.
There's been too much of this thing going on and I'm going to put a stop to it.
Horse stealing or wife stealing, Judge?
Let's get on with it.
I got some steers want brandin'.
All right, boys. Get on with it.
I'm a reasonable man, Judge.
Give him a re-count.
All right, Coley. Whatever you say.
Everybody in favour of hanging him, say "aye".
- Aye!
- Against?
No.
And who says no?
- Me.
- Just who are you to say no?
Who do you have to be to say no to a rigged court...
...stretching the neck of some poor slob?
And what would you suggest?
Well, she's just another horse.
She's nothin' special.
She... he could be anybody's.
This man says it's his, huh?
This man says it's his.
- One of them's a liar.
- You better prove I'm a liar.
- I can't do that.
- Then who can?
The horse.
It's all right with me, Judge. Take the horse out in the middle of the street.
Come on, horse.
Come on. Come on, horse.
Come to Daddy.
Come on, Billy-boy. Come on.
Billy-boy. Come on, Billy-boy.
Come on, Billy-boy.
Yeah, come on, fella.
Come on, Billy-boy. Come over here.
Come on.
Come on, Billy-boy. Come to Daddy.
That's it. Come on, Billy-boy. Come on.
Come on, fella. Come on.
Yeah, attaboy. Yeah, yeah.
(Judge) Well, that's fair and square and good enough for me. Case dismissed.
We'd better get outta here before they wise up.
(Coley) Hold it, you two!
I'm overrulin' the judge.
There's somethin' real snaky goin' on.
I know you, Chris.
A lot of people know you.
Mostly sheriffs.
That's my horse.
I want him.
And I'm gonna have him.
I'll count to three.
They'll draw on two.
One...
...two...
Let's go.
That's my horse! Let's get after them!
Is that your horse?
Nope.
Coley's the thief. Stole my horse in Dodge. Rigged faro game.
So you stole his, huh?
Yeah.
Well, that's only fair.
You didn't really have to call me a poor slob, did you?
Name's Keno.
I like that better than "poor slob".
I know you from someplace.
Fresno, Laramie, St Joe.
You ever been a lawman?
- I just got out.
- For what?
No questions.
No questions.
Hello, Chris.
It sure seems to be my day for strangers.
Oh, you were magnificent.
Both of you.
There you were, standing on the scaffold...
...alone and friendless...
...and the crowd is yelling
"Kill him! Kill him!"
But you stand there, ready to die.
Proud and defiant and unafraid.
And suddenly there's a voice.
"No."
And Chris, Chris steps forward.
As cool as the other side of the pillow.
One man against a thousand.
Chris, I'm so glad I follow you.
My cousin said to me "Find a man.
He's called Chris, and he will help you."
- Who's your cousin?
- In Mexico everyone is a cousin.
And all the cousins are in trouble now. Big trouble.
Angel Quintero has been captured.
He is our only leader.
With him we are something.
Without him we are nothing.
He's in prison. We need your help.
- Have you tried to get him out yourself?
- We have the will but not the way.
Diego, the prison comandante - he's a crazy one, and our hands are tied.
Un gato con guante no caza raton.
That's: A cat with... with mittens doesn't catch the rat.
Will you help us?
I have money.
I have lots of money.
Here, it's all yours.
- American?
It's American.
This prison, is it a big one?
It's the Cave of the Rats. It's like a fort.
I've heard of it.
I'd need help. More men.
We have the men. Quick with the guns, but slow with the brains.
Six men.
Not enough to cause suspicion, just enough to do the job.
Six men. $100 a man.
You like?
Yeah...
...I like.
- It's a deal.
- Thanks.
Oh, and Chris? Chris, can I fight with you?
Oh, it's not for the money -
I could not take it - but it's for Quintero.
Not on the basis of what you did against Keno.
Oh, but I'm young, I'm strong, I'm angry.
And I will learn.
Besides, my cousin says that seven is a lucky number for you, no?
- What's your name?
- Maximiliano Bienvenido O'Leary.
Why do you people always have such long names?
I don't know. Perhaps it's because we all have such short lives.
Well, Chris? Can I fight with you?
- Welcome, Max.
- Thank you, Chris.
Cave-in!
Cave-in!
We'll get you outta here.
We'll get you out. We'll get you out.
Hold on, we'll get you outta here.
Get him out! Get him out!
Ah!
That's great. That's gonna cost us nothin' but time and money.
I told you it might collapse.
The surface charge was too much.
You're all back and no brains, boy.
So you stick your damn advice.
The company shouldn't hire your kind.
Pick up your card and get your butt back up in the trees where you belong...
(Chris) He ain't worth killin', Cassie.
I wish I was as sure of that as you are!
(boss) You're through, you hear?
You're through!
Get the hell off of this property before I call the sheriff! Go on!
- What the hell are you doin' here?
- I'm lookin' for you.
- What's on your mind?
- I've got somethin' going.
I need ya.
- Who is this?
- Name's Keno.
This is a rough go, huh, Cassie?
Yeah.
If I hang around here much longer, I'll end up in jail.
Wouldn't you rather blow one up?
- For money or for laughs?
- About as much as you'd make in a year.
Not many laughs.
I don't work here no more.
I guess I might...
...take you up on that.
Chris, how are ya? It's good to see ya.
Long time. I'm sorry about your hat, stranger.
- Yeah, so am I.
- This is my friend, Keno.
Well, then you're no stranger. Levi.
Come on in. Get in there.
Well, sit down, sit down.
This is my...
This is my wife.
She's a good woman, but she don't like strangers, just me.
So I notice.
Kinda surprise you a little bit that I got these shots left in me?
- You didn't wait very long to fire 'em.
- I didn't have much time.
Supper's just about ready.
We're havin' beans.
- Hope you like beans. It's all we're havin'.
- Fine, fine.
Milk for the kids. No whisky.
We can't afford it.
- Land does look a little tough and dry.
- It's like jerky. Dry well don't help none.
- Why don't you dig a new one?
- No time. I gotta feed the family first.
Would $100 help?
- What's the action?
- Prison break. In Mexico.
No, Chris.
I've packed all that in.
I do my talkin' with my...
...mouth now, mostly.
Besides, I'm too old.
It's time for a-settin' and a-lookin'.
Most of the time, anyway.
$100 would dig you a new well.
Buy you a lot of staples.
I ain't as fast as I used to be.
You're probably a lot smarter.
And you look just as tough.
Well, what do you say we find out the way we used to?
One... two... three.
I think you're just bein' kind to me, Chris.
In more ways than one.
No, I've got guns.
But nobody handles a knife like you do.
- (wife) Beans, Mr Morgan?
- Beans, Mrs Morgan.
I'll think it over.
Buffalo Ben, is he? Never heard of him.
It ain't all that hard to shoot at somethin' that don't shoot back. I don't like rebs.
I think I just might shoot the buttons right off of that mangy uniform.
(Chris) Now you better get your friend to the doctor.
(man) It's just a part of the show, folks.
Just a part of the show.
Step right over here and meet God and Billy Joe Hatfield for only ten cents.
One thin dime, the tenth part of a dollar.
Yes, sir, folks.
The one and only Billy Joe...
...direct from a colossal and successful tour...
Hello, Chris.
Don't you remember me?
Slater.
It's... it's useless, Chris.
It's just about as useless as I am.
I've seen phoney acts, friend, but you're not one of 'em.
You're damn right I'm not, friend.
- Slater, this is Keno.
- Slater.
I'm a freak, Keno. I'm a half-man, half-gun.
I can't whip a six-year-old girl in a fair fight...
...but I can blow a man's eyeballs out at a hundred yards in a sandstorm.
Yes, sir, I'm a real attraction.
This is a tough way to make a livin'.
You know a better?
Better than this.
Chris, nobody ever heard of a one-armed gunny.
Not until just now.
Can we see you in town later?
Yeah.
You ain't just feelin' sorry for me?
A wife and a gaggle of kids.
So you sold out, Levi?
No, no. I bought in.
No, it takes a man my age to appreciate a real woman. She's worth it, too.
I appreciate 'em, Levi, every one I ever had. I just appreciated the hell out of 'em.
I don't think you ever met a real woman, nino.
- Except maybe your mama.
- Yeah.
Los hombres tienen que pelear, las mujeres tienen que llorar.
The... the men have to fight and the women have to cry.
I was lonely. I wanted to say something in my own language.
Why, Max, do men have to fight and women have to cry?
I don't know, Chris. It's just a saying.
Comin' out.
Oh.
I wish this was for real money.
Well, it won't be long.
$100. I've never even seen that much money before.
Sure buy a lot of watermelon.
You're about to get yourself all busted up, boy.
Your rag arm. If you weren't a cripple I'd break your back.
It was a joke, Cassie. A joke, that's all.
I don't see nobody laughin'.
Maybe it was a bad joke.
It was a bad joke. Let him go, Cassie.
(Chris) Queen bets.
- In for one.
- Yeah.
- I call.
- Yeah.
- Comin' round again. Ace with the queen.
- Here we go.
- Yeah.
- Jack, seven, ten.
May I have a word with you, Chris?
These are my friends, PJ.
Queen, ace bets one.
- Call.
- Hear you're lookin'.
- I'm lookin'.
- Well, I'm askin'.
You sure you're up to it, PJ?
Yeah, I'm up to it.
You wanna know what it is?
Well, if you're in, it's all right with me.
You wanna know the money?
Whatever you say.
There's a seat open over here, PJ.
Seven here.
(in Spanish) Hurry up. Come on.
(in Spanish) Speed it up.
Move it. Get in the wagon.
(boy) Papa! Papa!
Papa! Papa!
Hijo.
(in Spanish) Get back! Get in the wagon!
(in Spanish) Get back! Get back!
- (boy in Spanish) Leave him alone!
- (in Spanish) Get back!
(in Spanish) Diaz, go get the colonel quickly.
(in Spanish) My son, it's been such a long time.
(in Spanish) Come on, old man.
Get in the wagon!
(in Spanish) And you, boy, go to hell.
He's our prisoner. They have to go back.
I'm warning you, sir. Get out of my way.
Where do you live?
In the hills.
Have you no home?
They burned it.
Where will you go?
To find my father.
Well, maybe we can help you.
Why do you want to help me?
You ask too many questions.
- I asked only one.
- Then I will ask one.
Where will you go if not with us?
I will ride with him.
- What is your name?
- Levi Morgan. What's yours?
- Emiliano Zapata.
- I'll call you Emil.
- I'll call you Levi.
- All right.
He's the one I told you about.
There he is. The one I told you about.
Do you not know interfering with a federal guard is a prison offence?
I made a mistake. You have my apologies, Colonel.
Next time you will act differently?
You may be sure of that, Colonel.
A lot differently.
- What are you looking for here?
- Silver.
- What else?
- Gold?
Without supplies? No food or tools?
You hunt silver with a gun?
You shoot it like an animal?
No, we thought we would get our supplies here.
There is nothing here, senor.
No silver in the hills - only rebels.
I'm glad you told us that, Colonel.
If we see any rebels, we'll report them to you.
You will not stay long, senor.
Only until we get what we came for.
I trust that will be soon.
We all do, Colonel.
Una mona se vista de seda, mona se queda.
A pig without armour is still but a pig.
(in Spanish) Here comes Maximiliano!
Maximiliano! Maximiliano!
(in Spanish) Over here, Maximiliano!
I see and you see.
All the young men are hidden in the hills.
They'll come down when
Quintero is free and not before.
No, no, no. So, so, so, so, so, so.
Oh, oh, oh.
Yeah.
Thank you.
- Gracias.
- De nada.
It's Lobero.
- Is that a welcome party or a lynch party?
- With Lobero, you never can tell.
American.
Where are the cannons?
The guns? The dynamite?
Is this, these few men...
...this is what you bring to take our little dove from Diego?
- You don't understand, Lobero.
- I understand. Does he understand?
That one?
He is the leader.
I can tell. It is in the eyes.
Does he understand that he will have to fight against soldiers?
Soldiers, not Indians with little bows and arrows.
Soldiers! 10 times more than you.
20, 30 times more.
- He has a plan.
- He has a plan(?)
He also has our money, but I am the only one that has the men and the guns.
What plan? Where is this plan?
When I'm ready, I'll tell ya.
When he is ready.
Not when Lobero is ready, when he is ready!
- Well, give him a chance, Lobero.
- I do not need your advice!
All right.
I will wait.
But not for long.
Vamonosl
- Levi?
- Huh?
Will my father ever come home?
Oh, you bet he will.
- Levi?
- Hm?
Will you be my father until he comes home?
You bet I will.
- Levi?
- What?
Why is it that people always fight?
Well, someday you're gonna be an old man, just like me...
...and when you are you may get an answer to that question and if you do...
...you tell me, will ya?
You bet I will.
- Max?
- Hm?
You ever been inside the rathole?
Not yet.
Well, you will be.
- How's that?
- We gotta get the layout.
How are we going to get in?
Just ride in.
(Slater) I'm a freak. I'm a freak.
Rag man... rag arm.
I'm a freak.
Freak... freak.
Freak.
(man) Buffalo Ben, is he?
Never heard of him.
(Cassie) Rag arm... You're going to get yourself all busted up, boy.
If you weren't a cripple,
I'd break your back.
(Slater) It was a joke, Cassie.
A joke, that's all.
(Cassie) I don't see nobody laughin'.
We need water for our horses.
You must have permission.
Well, your colonel is an old friend.
I will check with the sergeant.
Permission to water horses.
Si.
The sergeant, he will talk to the colonel.
It's a nice place you've got here.
Thank you. The presidente himself gave us a commendation.
- It's a big place.
- 200 men.
Does my friend work you seven days a week?
It is hard work. But only six days.
Sunday is no work.
- Our wives come that day.
- Early, I bet, huh?
Unhappily, no, sir.
In the afternoon after church.
Some just say they are wives.
I have two.
- The prisoners' wives come too?
- Never. Seven days a week for them.
Well, have fun with both your wives.
Ah, the treasure hunters.
You are just in time.
You will talk now...
...or you will never talk again.
Who are your district leaders?
Where are your guns?
What are your orders?
With what treacherous generals do you meet?
I repeat, with what treacherous generals do you meet?
I cannot ask your forgiveness, my friends.
I can only ask it of God.
The ceremony is over.
Soon there will be another...
...and another, and another, until you learn.
Did you find your silver?
- No silver.
- Where are the rest of your men?
In the hills.
Oh, that is dangerous. The hills are full of bandits and criminals.
You will be leaving soon?
Good. I would advise it.
I have advised it before.
Yes.
Very few men have impressed me as you have, Colonel.
Lieutenant.
Did you notice anything... anything unusual?
No, sir.
That is why you are not a colonel.
They did not water their horses.
Why did they come here?
You've seen what I've seen, except in the prison.
You should be glad you didn't see it.
That's 200 of 'em.
- That's thirty to one.
- Thin odds.
What about Lobero?
You never can tell with him.
He changes like the wind.
- Without him, we might be dead.
- Even with him, we might be.
You want out? Nobody told you it would be easy. You're being paid to do a job.
I'm gonna do what I have to do, you're gonna do what you have to do.
Anybody that wants out is out.
Whoa!
When do we fight?
Ask Chris.
You.
You have looked. You have seen.
What do you wait for?
I say attack, now.
You have been paid.
Earn it. You have taken the money, but you do not deliver the goods.
What do you know of this land?
Of my people and their needs?
You are nothing but a stinking hired killer.
You say you have a plan.
What is this plan for my people?
You're not one of your people.
You are a liar and a coward.
If you move any way but backwards, then you lose that eye.
Now get outta here.
Vamonosl
Ha! Ha!
There go our troops.
Emil, are you sure this is the way?
I am sure. I think.
- There are gonna be three wagons?
- That's what I saw before.
Chris.
I don't believe him. Lobero.
- About what?
- The money.
You do not help us only because of the money.
Do you, Chris?
Like Max says, you ask too many questions.
Drop it!
- Vamonos, vamonos.
- Amigos, atras, atras.
Atras, atras.
(in Spanish) Come on! Move it!
(in Spanish) Let's go! Everybody out.
Vamonos, vamonos. Rapido, rapido.
Rapidol Vamonos.
- Vamonos, vamonos.
- Papal Papal Papal
Back in the wagon!
Come on! Get in there!
Get back in the wagon!
Come on. Come on.
(in Spanish) Come on!
(in Spanish) And you, and you, and you...
Now we got somethin' to work with.
It cuts the odds. Not much, but some.
Chris, I have 20 men. One for each rifle and each horse. They're ready to fight.
- But can they?
- Well, they're young, strong, angry...
- And they will learn, huh?
- Right.
(in Spanish) Get on the horses!
Drink.
Drink.
It is hot.
It is good for you.
You are skinny.
You could be such a fine-looking man.
You have a good face.
Did your mother never feed you?
Maybe I should fatten you up.
About last night...
Thanks.
- But of all of 'em, why you?
- I was the closest.
This uniform didn't bother you none?
Why should it?
It's dead, man.
You're wearing a shroud.
You don't know what it's like, Cassie.
Bein' lonely an' all.
People look at ya like you're some sort of animal.
Slater, you are an amateur.
You don't know what being lonely really is.
If it's conversation you're looking for, tell me how you got to be a cripple...
...and I'll tell you all about bein' black.
- Do they always cover the wagons?
- Yes.
To keep the sulphur from blowing away in the wind.
- Where do they go?
- To the railroad.
- How far?
- Two, maybe three miles.
- Every day?
- Sometimes twice.
- What's at the railroad?
- A small place.
An office for the railroad and a cantina for the federales.
(in Spanish) Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name...
- How's it goin'?
- Rough.
They wanna learn. I've tried to teach 'em.
Some of 'em could be damn good.
But we need more time.
There's no more time. Tomorrow's ladies' day at the rathole.
They'll hardly be in a fightin' mood.
Too bad Lobero isn't.
We could still use him.
I don't think you'd like him ridin' behind ya.
Gabriel.
- Just in case.
- No, Chris. We made a deal. It's yours.
When you get Quintero back, we get that back.
- Chris?
- Yeah?
Can I go with you tomorrow?
- No.
- Why not?
You're too little.
Chris?
Mm-hm?
How big do you have to be to die?
Go to bed, Emil.
You scared, reb?
No.
I am.
You just don't give a damn.
Ain't that about it, Slater?
No, you just don't believe in life after birth.
Do you?
Did once.
Now I can't even get a job to support my wife and kids.
And you think you've got troubles?
You could have been a black one-armed gunny.
You got a wife and kids?
What happened?
She found a whole man.
Well, I guess that makes her about half a woman. And you're better off, boy.
These people...
...they got you hooked.
No man gets hooked unless he wants to be hooked.
Besides, what else is there?
There's no more open land.
Mountain man is dead.
Buffalo are gone. Soon the horses'll go.
Then it'll be our turn.
You know anybody that'll be sorry to see you go?
Maybe these people'll be sorry to see us go.
What am I preachin' at you for?
I'll see you in the mornin'.
Yeah. I hope you'll see me tomorrow night too.
Lobero! Maximiliano comes.
Well, tomorrow is the day.
So, he sent you to apologise to me, uh?
He wants to beg me to help him.
He does not even know I'm here.
He would shoot me.
- He's a proud man.
- A proud man.
He is a greedy man.
Well, perhaps, in the beginning, maybe he was...
...but now... now, he feels for us.
Then let him fight for us.
I hear that he has an army.
Killers, with rifles from the federales.
It's only a few farmers.
Listen, Lobero. If it's an apology you want, I apologise.
- I beg for your help.
- Lobero, maybe we should...
What has Quintero ever done for us?
Has he made me a general?
No.
He has fancy clothes.
He makes fancy talk.
He's no more than a politico.
What will get us guns?
A little man with a funny hat...
...or $600 that you gave to a stranger?
Chris was right.
You don't have big dreams,
Lobero, only a big belly.
And the rest of you, remember tomorrow, when you're half drunk and all crazy...
...that your brothers are out there dying for you.
Maximiliano is right.
You have no big dreams.
Shh!
Shh!
My horse threw me.
My horse threw me back... there.
(in Spanish) Out! Out! Let's go! Hurry up!
(in Spanish) Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
(whispers) PJ.
(in Spanish) It's an attack!
Cassie!
Go!
Take some men. Kill Quintero, quickly.
Maximiliano. Hijo mio.
A la torrel
Keno.
No questions.
It will not be long for them now.
Well, did you find your silver?
Do not worry, Carlotta. He will not shoot us. I know this kind.
He fights for money, not for passion.
Matter of business with him.
Maybe we can make what you call...
...a deal, huh?
- Where's your hero?
- Lobero?
He was sick.
A bullet. In...
...his belly.
Emil, uh... I made this for ya.
It's really just a frog sticker, Emiliano...
...but if a man used a real one in the right way...
...he might be able to help his people one day.
- Levi?
- What?
Chris.
Chris, we're going to scatter in the hills and we're going to fight them again.
We will stalk them in the night like jaguars.
We will... we will sweep down from the mountains like hawks.
We're going to tear out their throats like wolves.
In the deserts, Chris, in the valleys, all of us, Chris...
Goodbye, Chris.
Los cobardes mueren muchas muertes.
El valiente, solo una.
Max, you must stop them, quickly.
- The money. All the money. He forgot.
- Chris! Chris!
Max!
He did not forget.
Max? What did Chris say?
He said that cowards die many deaths, the brave only one.
Visiontext Subtitles:
Marisa Castle de Joncaire
Good night, Pat.
Good night.
What happened to the old bank?
It was beautiful.
People kept robbing it.
That's a small price to pay for beauty.
Hit me.
Again.
Bust!
Give me credit,
Mr. Macon?
You know my rules, Tom.
Well, it looks like you just about cleaned everybody out, fella.
You haven't lost a hand since you got the deal.
What's the secret of your success?
Prayer.
Let's just you and me play.
Hit it.
Bust.
Yeah, you're a hell of a card player, fella.
I know, 'cause I'm a hell of a card player, and I can't even spot how you're cheating.
The money stays, and you go.
Well, we seem to be a little short on brotherly love around here.
If you're with him, you better get out of here.
We're on our way.
I wasn't cheating.
Come on.
I wasn't cheating!
You can die.
You can both die.
You hear that?
If he invites us to stay, then we'll go.
He's got to invite us to stick around.
He'll draw on you.
You don't know how fast he is.
I'm over the hill, but it can happen to you.
That's just what I want to hear.
Every day you get older.
That's a law.
What would you think about maybe asking us to stick around?
What?
You don't have to mean it or anything.
Just ask us to stick around.
I promise...
I can't help you,
Sundance.
I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating.
I draw on you, you'll kill me.
There's that possibility.
You'd be killing yourself.
Why don't you just invite us to stick around?
You can do it... and easy.
Come on.
Come on.
Why don't you stick around?
Thanks, but we got to get going.
Hey, Kid.
Hey, Kid, how good are you?
Like I been telling you... over the hill.
Boy, you know, every time I see
Hole-In-The-Wall, it's like seeing it for the first time.
Every time, I ask myself the same question... how can I be so damn stupid to keep coming back?
What's your idea this time?
Bolivia.
What's Bolivia?
Bolivia... that's a country, stupid.
Central or
South America.
One or the other.
Let's go to Mexico instead.
All they got in Mexico is sweat.
There's too much of that here.
If we'd been in business during the California gold rush, where would we have gone?
California, right?
When I say Bolivia, you just think California.
You wouldn't believe what they're finding in the ground down there.
They're just falling into it.
Silver mines, gold mines, tin mines.
Payrolls so heavy we'd strain ourselves stealing them.
You just keep thinking,
Butch.
That's what you're good at.
Boy, I got vision, and the rest of the world wears bifocals.
Hi, News.
What you doing?
Aw, howdy, Butch.
Uh, nothing.
Nothing.
Howdy, Sundance.
You sure are. You're doing something. What?
Just fixing to rob the Union Pacific Flyer, Butch, like what we had in mind.
You fellas got everything
I told you all wrong.
Sure, we might hit the Flyer, but even if we do, it won't be this run.
It'll be the next one, the return.
Sundance and me, we been checking the banks.
No banks.
What?
The Flyer, Butch.
Fellas, bad as they are, banks are better than trains.
They don't move.
They stay put.
You know the money's in there.
When I left,
I gave orders.
New orders been given.
I run things here,
Harvey.
Used to you did.
Me now.
This don't concern you.
You tell him to stay out.
Well, he goes his own way, like always.
What's the matter with you guys?
When I came here, you were nothing.
I formed you.
Who says?
Read them a clipping, News.
Which one?
Any of them.
This one here's from Salt Lake Herald.
"Butch Cassidy's
Hole-In-The-Wall Gang..."
That's me!
You want Harvey to do your planning?
Want him to do your thinking for you?
You want him to run things?
Shut up now, News.
Not till I get to the good part.
"Also known to have participated in the holdup are Flat Nose Curry and News Carver."
I just love to read my name in the paper, Butch.
So we just forget about Logan taking over,
OK, Flat Nose?
You always said that any one of us could challenge you.
'Cause I figured no one would do it.
Figured wrong, Butch.
You guys can't want Logan!
At least he's with us.
You been spending a lot of time gone.
Well, that's because everything's different now.
Guns or knives, Butch?
You got to plan more, prepare more.
Guns or knives?
Neither.
Pick!
I don't want to shoot with you, Harvey.
Anything you say, Butch.
Maybe there's a way to make a profit in this.
Bet on Logan.
I would, but who'd bet on you?
Sundance... when we're done and he's dead, you're welcome to stay.
I don't mean to be a sore loser, but when it's done, if I'm dead, kill him.
Love to.
No, no. Not yet.
Not until me and Harvey get the rules straightened out.
Rules in a knife fight?
No rules.
If there ain't any rules, let's get started.
Someone count
1, 2, 3, go.
1, 2, 3, go.
I was really rooting for you, Butch.
Well, thank you,
Flat Nose.
That's what sustained me in my time of trouble.
Hey, what's this about the Flyer?
Harvey said we'd hit it both this run and the return.
Nobody's done that to the Flyer before.
No matter how much we got at first, they'd figure the return was safe and load it up with money.
Harvey thought of that?
Yes, sir, he did.
I'll tell you something, fellas.
That's exactly what we're going to do.
Stop it.
Where?
Up ahead there.
Bet that's old Butch himself.
Hold it there.
Just thought I'd watch.
Bring the kids, why don't you?
Stick your heads in.
You're just going to get yourself blown up you don't open that door.
I can't do that.
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific
Railroad. He...
Shut up about that E.H. Harriman stuff and open up.
What's going on?
We got a patriot in there.
That's young Woodcock.
He's awful dedicated.
Woodcock?
Yes, sir.
You know who we are?
You're the Hole-In-The-Wall
Gang, Mr. Cassidy.
I understand that, but Mr. E.H. Harriman himself give me this job.
I got to do my best.
Your best don't include getting yourself killed.
Dynamite's ready.
Mr. E.H. Harriman himself had the confidence...
Open the door, or that's it.
You think
E.H. Harriman would get himself killed for you,
Woodcock?
I work for Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific
Railroad, and he entrusted me...
Hey, Woodcock.
Woodcock, you all right?
Hey.
Hmm?
Whatever Harriman's paying you ain't enough.
There ain't what I'd call a fortune in there, Butch.
Well, just so we come out ahead.
That's the main thing.
The Hole-In-The-Wall Gang
The Hole-In-The-Wall Gang
just robbed the Flyer right outside of our town, so that makes it our responsibility to get out there and get after them.
You'll have to bring your own horses.
How many of you can bring your own guns?
How many of you will want me to supply you with guns?
Well... come on now.
I think it's up to us to do something, don't you?
What's the point?
They're probably halfway to Hole-In-The-Wall already.
That's exactly why we have got to hurry.
If we mount up right now and get out there after them, maybe we can head them off.
If we did that, they'd kill us.
We don't want to let them get away with this.
Boy, I just eat this up with a spoon.
All right, youse two,
I want you at my party.
What party?
I'm losing my piano player.
He's going off to fight the war.
What war?
The war with the Spanish.
Remember the Maine.
Who can forget it?
I'm giving him a send-off. so come on.
When I was a kid,
I always thought
I would grow up to be a hero.
It's too late now.
Why'd you say something like that?
You didn't have to say something like that.
You want me to go alone and fight the Hole-In-The-Wall Gang?
That's fine with me.
If you want your kids to know you let me,
that's fine with me, but I don't think that's what you want.
Is it?
Why don't we enlist, go fight the Spanish?
You and me in the war.
We got a lot of things going for us... experience, maturity, leadership.
I'll bet we end up officers.
I'd be Major Parker.
Parker?
Yeah.
That's my real name.
Robert Leroy Parker.
No fooling?
No.
Mine's Longbaugh.
No fooling.
Long what?
Harry Longbaugh.
So you'd be
Major Longbaugh.
What do you say?
You just keep thinking,
Butch.
That's what you're good at.
But you're not frightened.
No, sir.
You have got respect for me,
and I have got respect for you.
That's why you and you and you are riding with me.
Am I right?
Well, what do you say?
I say this.
I say, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, friends and enemies, meet the future!
The future what?
The future mode of transportation for this weary
Western world.
Now, I'm not going to make a lot of extravagant claims.
Sure, it'll change your whole life for the better, but that's all.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
You got the crowd together, so I thought I'd do a little selling.
I'm trying to raise a posse here.
A short presentation.
The horse is dead.
This item sells itself.
Are you going to listen to him or come with me?
Butch, Fanny says to come into her party right now.
No oats, no mess, no kicks, no bites,
no running away, no stepping on your foot.
Well, I think
I'll get saddled up and go looking for a woman.
Good hunting.
Shouldn't take more than a couple of days.
I'm not picky... as long as she's smart, pretty... sweet... gentle, and... tender and refined... lovely... carefree.
Aah!
Keep going, teacher lady.
It's OK Don't mind me.
Keep on going.
Let down your hair.
Shake your head.
Do you know what I wish?
That once you'd get here on time.
You are mine,
Etta Place.
Mine.
You hear me?
Mine.
All mine.
Your soft white flesh is mine.
Soft... white... bwhaa!
Meet the future.
Do you know what you're doing?
Theoretically.
Aah!
You've come to get him for the Flyer?
Would you believe
I'm broke already?
Why is there never any money, Butch?
I swear, Etta,
I don't know.
I've been working like a dog all my life, and I can't get a penny ahead.
Sundance says it's because you're a soft touch and always taking expensive vacations, buying drinks for everyone, and you're a rotten gambler.
That might have something to do with it.
Butch.
Hmm?
Do you ever wonder if I'd met you first we'd been the ones to get involved?
We are involved, Etta.
Don't you know that?
You are riding on my bicycle.
In some Arabian countries, that's the same as being married.
Hey.
What are you doing?
Stealing your woman.
Take her.
Take her.
Well, you're a romantic bastard.
I'll give you that.
OK, open up in there.
I work for
Mr. E.H. Harriman...
Hey, Woodcock!
Butch?
You OK?
Uh, well, sort of.
Hey, that's wonderful.
Let's take a look at you.
Well, now, Butch, you've got to have more respect for me than to think I'd fall for a stunt like that.
You can't want to get blown up again?
Uh, Butch, you know if it were my money, there's nobody I'd rather have steal it than you.
But I'm still in the employ of Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific
Railroad.
Start this train!
Get back inside, lady.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm a grandmother and a female, and I've got my rights.
We got no time for this.
You can bull the others, but not me.
I've fought whiskey, and I've fought gambling...
We got no time for this.
What are you doing?
Let go!
What are you going to do to her?
Well, leave her alone.
You're after the money, and the money's in here.
Please! All I want is for somebody to start this train.
Somebody, please!
Open the door,
Woodcock, or tell her goodbye.
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name,
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
What am I going to tell poor Mr. Harriman?
Woodcock, what'd you have to go and do something like that for?
Well, Butch, you blew the last one so easy,
I just had to, um, do something.
Give me that and get some more, a lot more!
Well, that ought to do it.
Think you used enough dynamite there, Butch?
Ha ha ha ha.
What the hell is that?
Whatever they're selling,
I don't want it.
Will you leave it?
Come on!
Hyah!
Hey, Butch!
What?
They're very good!
Split up!
How many of 'em are following us?
All of 'em.
All of 'em?
What's the matter with those guys?
Hyah!
I think we lost 'em.
Do you think we lost 'em?
No.
Neither do I. Hyah!
Take our horses out back. Feed 'em good.
Where's Sweetface?
Just inside.
Trouble?
Listen, you dirty old man,
I know you're a lying thief and so do you, but who'd know it to look at you?
Get yourself out front fast.
You seen us ride through not five minutes ago.
Do this right,
I'll get you an old dog to kick.
Here, room 9.
Top of the stairs.
Hey, you realize you're driving me crazy staring out the window like that?
I swear, Sweetface can handle it, easy.
He wouldn't dare louse me up.
He's that scared of me.
Hey, kid, how can I give Agnes the concentration she deserves with you staring out the window like that?
Butch, you're really something, you know that?
Could you be a little more specific about that, Agnes?
Butch!
OK, Sweetface, give them a nice smile.
Come on.
That's a nice touch.
I swear, if he told me
I rode out of town
10 minutes ago,
I'd believe him.
And there they go.
No, no.
Don't ask me to stay.
You're the only real man I ever met.
You know that, Butch?
It's not just 'cause of all that money you got to spend on people. It's you.
The way you're always looking to see am I happy or not?
A lot of the other girls, they... they might want you for when you got lots of money to spend on people.
Me, I... I don't care about... clothes and money and jewels... and furs, and things like that.
Lots of the other girls do, but I never did.
I always said,
"Agnes..."
Don't move.
Stand up.
Put your hands up.
Higher.
Now turn around and start...
Get our horses and come on back here.
Hyah!
Get out of here!
Get out!
Go on!
Get out of here, you fat-headed beast!
Come on!
You're the fat-headed beast.
Quit shouting!
Boy, somebody sure trained 'em.
Which way?
Well, it doesn't matter.
I don't know where we've been, and I've just been there.
They can't follow us.
We're safe.
You really think so?
I will if you will.
How long you figure we've been watching?
Oh, a while.
How long before you figure they're not after us?
A while longer.
How come you're so talkative?
Just naturally blabby, I guess.
Ohh! I haven't done so much riding since I quit rustling.
That's a miserable occupation.
Dusk to dawn, no sleep, rotten food.
Hey.
I see it.
Torches you think?
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe lanterns.
They're following our path.
Dead on it.
I couldn't do that.
Could you do that?
How can they do that?
Who are those guys?
You sure this'll work?
It'll work.
That's what you said about Sweetface.
This'll work.
Once they divide up, we take them, no trouble, right?
Maybe.
Boy, for a gunman, you're one hell of a pessimist.
They ought to get to where we split up any time.
They're just about there.
How many of them do you think will come our way?
Oh, I wish we had rifles.
I mean, they got rifles.
But we got surprise on our side, right?
So far, they're doing what we want.
You think we ought to take them from up here?
Kid, look, you know this work better than I do.
Is it best here, or maybe down there, closer to the trail?
Uh...
Damn it!
They're not going for it.
Who are those guys?
I don't know.
I don't know.
We got to do something and shake them.
Whatever you come up with is fine with me, but whatever it is, it better be now!
What are you doing here?
Easy, Ray. Easy.
What the hell do you mean, take it easy?
You promised you'd never come into my territory.
And we haven't.
Just because we were friendly doesn't give you the right to break in.
What if we was seen together?
I'm too old to find another job.
At least have the decency to draw your guns.
Listen, Butch is trying to tell you something.
All right.
What do you want?
A couple of things.
We want to enlist, Ray.
In the army.
Right away.
Go fight the Spanish.
Oh, you're crazy.
You are crazy.
You are, both of you, crazy!
They'd throw you in jail for a thousand years each.
Come on, Sundance.
Start trussing my feet.
Here. You seen these before. Come on!
I'm not taking the chance that someone saw you coming in.
We're serious about this.
You are known outlaws.
We'd quit.
That's the point.
Is that on tight?
That's all right.
There's some hankies in the drawer you can use to gag me.
I swear, this'd work, Ray.
You trust us.
The government trusts you.
Anything you tell them they gotta believe, right?
You've never done a dishonest thing ever, and you're pushing 60.
We'd quit.
They'd drop the charges against us, we'd fight till the war is over.
They don't even have to make us officers.
That's some proposition.
They forget all about the years of thieving and robbing.
They take you into the army, which is what you want in the first place.
There's something out there that scares you, huh?
But it's too late.
You should've let yourself get killed while you had the chance.
You may be the biggest thing to hit this area, but you're still two-bit outlaws.
I never met a soul more affable than you, Butch, or faster than the Kid.
But you're still two-bit outlaws on the dodge.
It's over!
Don't you get that?
Your times is over, and you're gonna die bloody, and all you can do is choose where.
I'm sorry,
I'm getting mean in my old age.
Come on. Shut me up,
Sundance.
Ah, you're wasting your time.
They can't track us over rock.
Tell them that.
They're beginning to get on my nerves.
Who are those guys?
You remember the time you, me, and Etta went to Denver for a vacation?
I'm glad you brought that up, Kid.
That's an important topic, considering our situation.
The night we went gambling, remember?
We had dinner at the hotel.
Etta had roast beef, and I had chicken.
If I can remember what you had,
I'll die happy.
Look out there.
What?
I got to talking to some gambler that night.
He told us about an Indian... full-blooded Indian, except he used an English name,
Sir... somebody.
Lord Baltimore?
That's right, and he could track anybody over anything day or night.
So?
The guy on the ground,
I think it's him.
No. Baltimore works out of Oklahoma.
He's strictly an Oklahoma man.
I don't know where we are, but it isn't Oklahoma.
Ah, it couldn't be him.
It couldn't be him.
I guess.
Whoever it is, it sure the hell is somebody.
Damn it!
Don't they get tired?
Don't they get hungry?
They've gotta be.
Why don't they slow up?
They could even go faster.
At least that'd be a change.
They don't even break formation.
Do something!
Kid.
What?
Who's the best lawman?
Best? How?
You mean toughest or easiest to bribe?
Toughest.
Joe LeFors.
Gotta be.
LeFors never leaves
Wyoming. Never.
You know that.
He always wears a white skimmer.
That's how you tell it's Joe LeFors,
'cause he wears a white straw hat.
Look at that guy out front.
Jesus, who are those guys?
Hyah!
Come on now.
Here you go, Kid.
Go on! Get out of here!
Go on!
What if they don't follow the horse?
You're the brains,
Butch.
You'll think of something.
Damn it!
The way I figure it, we can either fight or give.
If we give, we go to jail.
I've been there already.
If we fight, they can stay where they are and starve us out... or go for position, shoot us.
Might even get a rock slide started.
What else can they do?
They could surrender to us, but I wouldn't count on that.
They're going for position, all right.
Better get ready.
Kid, the next time
I say let's go someplace like Bolivia, let's go someplace like Bolivia.
Next time.
Ready?
No. We'll jump.
Like hell we will.
No. It'll be O.K. if the water's deep enough and we don't get squished to death.
They'll never follow us.
How do you know?
Would you jump that if you didn't have to?
I have to, and I'm not gonna.
We got to.
Otherwise we're dead.
Come on.
Just one clear shot... that's all I want.
I want to fight them!
They'll kill us.
Maybe.
You want to die?
Do you?
All right,
I'll jump first.
No.
Then you jump first.
No, I said.
What's the matter?
I can't swim!
Why, you crazy?
The fall will probably kill you.
Oh-oh... ohhh... shiiiit!
Hang on to me.
You're drowning me!
I can't help it.
I can't swim.
You're choking me!
I can't swim!
I'm telling you, if I drown,
I swear to God
I'll kill you.
Never said I was a great swimmer.
Oh! You're choking me!
Oh! I'm choking!
Let go of me.
I'm choking!
Let go of my throat.
The papers said they had you.
Was it LeFors?
Did they say?
Joe LeFors?
I think so.
And their tracker?
Tracker?
Was it Lord Baltimore?
I think so.
The paper's inside.
You got enough to feed us?
Don't you know I do?
They said you were dead.
Don't make a big thing out of it.
No. Make a big thing out of it.
Hey.
It was Baltimore and LeFors.
You know who else?
Who?
Jeff Carr,
George Hiatt...
Hiatt?
T.T. Kelliher.
We lucked out getting away.
You know that?
Why would these guys join up and take after us, though?
Forget it.
Bunch like that won't stay together long.
They will... if Mr. Harriman has his way.
Who?
Mr. E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific
Railroad.
He resents the way you've been picking on him, so he's outfitted a special train and hired special employees.
You've been avoiding them for two days.
It's really sort of flattering if you want to think about it that way.
A setup like that costs more than we ever took.
Apparently he can afford it.
That crazy Harriman.
That's bad business.
How long do you think
I'd stay in operation if every job cost me money?
If he'd just pay me what he's spending to make me stop robbing him,
I'd stop robbing him.
You probably inherited every penny you got!
Inherited guys, what the hell do they know?
You say they were hired permanent?
No. Just till they kill you.
That means they're still after us, Butch, and it's going to be the same thing all over again.
They'll show up here... sooner or later.
Hey, Etta.
I'll get you some more.
Butch and me have been talking it all over.
Wherever the hell
Bolivia is, that's where we're off to.
We'll go down there and play it safe, maybe keep our hand in a little bit.
Butch speaks some Spanish.
I can wrestle with a menu O.K.
And you speak it good.
And it'd be good cover going with a woman.
No one expects it.
Then we could travel safer.
What I'm saying is, if you want to go,
I won't stop you, but the minute you start to whine or make a nuisance,
I don't care where we are,
I'm dumping you flat.
Don't sugarcoat it like that, Kid.
Tell her straight.
I'm 26, and I'm single and a schoolteacher, and that's the bottom of the pit.
And the only excitement
I've known is here with me now.
So I'll go with you, and I won't whine, and I'll sew your socks, and I'll stitch you when you're wounded, and I'll do anything you ask of me except one thing.
I won't watch you die.
I'll miss that scene, if you don't mind.
The future's all yours, you lousy bicycles.
Well, you know, it could be worse.
You get a lot more for your money in Bolivia.
I checked on it.
What could they have here that you could possibly want to buy?
Jeez, all Bolivia can't look like this.
How do you know?
This might be the garden spot of the whole country.
People may travel hundreds of miles just to get to this spot where we're standing now.
This might be the Atlantic City, New Jersey, of all Bolivia for all you know.
I know more about Bolivia than you know about
Atlantic City, New Jersey,
I can tell you that.
Aha!
You do, huh?
I was born there.
I was born in New Jersey... brought up there, so...
I didn't know that.
The total tonnage of what you don't know is enough to shatter...
We're not accomplishing as much as we might.
Listen, your job is to back me up, because you'd starve without me.
And you, your job is to shut up.
He'll feel a lot better after he's robbed a couple of banks.
Ha ha ha ha!
Bolivia.
Hell, it's just a bank like any other bank.
You got to move in slowly, check out everything.
The thing to remember...
Don't tell me how to rob a bank.
I know how to rob a bank.
A few dark clouds appear on your horizon, and you just go all to pieces, don't you?
Buenos días, señores.
¿Les puedo servir en algo?
Ordenen para atenderlos por favor inmediatamente.
¿Quieren hacer algún depósito?
¿Quieren abrir una cuenta?
Bien, el cajero los atienda inmediatamente.
Los atendemos por todo.
Señor?
Adiós.
This is a robbery.
Esto es un robo.
Esto es un robo.
This is supposed to be a unison recitation.
Why do I have to do any of this?
He's the one who claimed he knew the language.
Your line of work requires a specialized vocabulary.
I got nervous. I forgot the words. Shoot me.
You've had worse ideas lately.
Raise your hands.
Uh... las manos arriba.
Raise them.
Arriba.
All of you back against the wall.
Todos ustedes, um...
arrímense a la pared.
Give me the money.
Give me the money.
Give me the money.
This is not going to work, and we're going to be up all night until you get this.
Now give me the money.
It's on the tip of my tongue, Etta.
I swear it.
Butch, are you still thinking in there?
What the hell else is there to do?
Try this one.
Where is the safe?
Open it.
Dónde es...
Uh, that's a hard one.
¿Dónde está la caja?
¡Ábrala!
That's very good, Butch.
You're a good teacher,
Etta.
¡Esto es un robo!
Manos a...
Manos, um...
¡Manos arriba!
They got them up!
Skip down!
- ¡Arriba!
- Skip on down!
Todos ustedes arrísmense a la pared.
They're against the wall already!
Dónde es...
Oh, you're so damn smart, you read it.
A goddamn crib sheet.
You almost blew it.
You sure didn't help much.
You can't do anything without a crib sheet.
For God's sake, don't drop the money!
I won't drop the money!
Voy a traer el comisario.
Sí, vamos.
Ay, nombre.
Evarista.
¿Evarista qué?
Señor comandante,
dos hombres acometen y asaltan el banco.
Dos yanquis y una muchacha
se fueron por la cañada.
Se llevaron mi pistola y todo el dinero.
Vámanos!
A caballos!
Isn't that a pretty sight?
Well, we're back in business, boys and girls, just like the old days.
Let's stay here and get him and be done with it.
But what if we lose?
We saw him with two guys.
What if he's got 20?
You don't know for sure it's LeFors.
I'm a hell of a guesser.
He can't arrest you.
It's a foreign country.
He can't take you back.
He's not going to take anybody back.
He's going to wait for us to pull another job and then hunt us down.
Let's finish it now,
Butch, one way or the other.
He's got to wait for us to pull another job.
Well, what if there isn't another job?
He can't arrest us, and he can't take us out of here.
We'll drive him crazy.
We'll outlast the bastard.
We'll go straight.
So you want jobs.
You're from the U.S. of A., and you are seeking after employment.
Well, you couldn't have picked a more out of the way place in all of Bolivia,
I'll tell you that.
Gracias, Jesús.
Ordinarily you've got to wait to work for
Percy Garrison, but this ain't ordinarily.
Bingo.
You mean there are jobs.
Yes, there are jobs.
There are lots of jobs.
Don't you want to know why?
Yeah, why?
Damn it.
Because I cannot promise to pay you.
Don't you want to know why?
OK, why?
On account of the payroll thieves, fellow citizens.
You see, every mine around gets its payroll from La Paz.
And every mine around gets its payroll held up.
Some say it's the
Bolivian Bandits, and some say
that it's the bandidos yanquis.
Could I see that?
Mm-hmm.
Fairly nice-looking piece.
Can you hit anything?
Sometimes.
Hit that.
No, no, son.
No, son.
I just want to know, can you shoot your piece?
Shoot.
Damn it.
Can I move?
Move?
What the hell you mean, move?
I'm better when I move.
Yeah.
Well, considering that I'm desperate and you're just what
I'm looking for, on top of which you stem from the U.S. of A., we start tomorrow morning.
You mean we got jobs.
Payroll guard.
Damn.
Vámanos a trabajar!
Hey, Chucho!
Chucho!
I think they're in the trees up ahead.
In the bushes on the left.
They're in the trees up ahead.
You take the trees,
I'll take the bushes.
Will you two beginners cut it out?
Well, we're just trying to spot an ambush.
Morons.
I've got morons on my team.
Nobody is going to rob us going down the mountain.
We have got no money going down the mountain.
When we have got the money on the way back, then you can sweat.
Bingo.
Move it out!
Move it!
We hit this place in June, didn't we?
Jones!
Give me a hand over here.
Who am I,
Smith or Jones?
Live.
About a half hour more, and we can start to worry... as soon as we get to that pass up there.
We'll be all right till then.
They might try something here.
No. Better cover up there.
You got to relax, you fellas.
You got to get used to Bolivian ways.
You got to go easy.
Damn it!
Like I do.
Of course, you probably think I'm crazy, but I'm not.
Bingo.
I'm colorful.
That's what happens when you live 10 years alone in Bolivia.
You get colorful.
Where are they?
I can't see them.
Let's get out of here.
Tell them to leave the money and go.
Dijen el dinoro...
Dinero... and, uh...
y váyanese.
¿Que dejemos el dinero y nos vayamos?
Tell them we were hired to take it back.
It's our job.
Tell them the money isn't ours.
El dinero...
no es nuestro.
No, ya no es de ustedes.
Ahora es de nosotros.
Claro.
We'll try telling them again.
It's our job.
The money isn't ours.
El dinero no es nuestro.
Lo necesitamos.
También nosotros necesitamos.
What do you think?
Not so good.
Can you take the two on the right?
Kid, there's something
I think I ought to tell you.
I never shot anybody before.
One hell of a time to tell me.
Try for the two on the right dead center.
That way, if you miss a little, you'll still hit something.
Go.
Please.
¿Qué?
Por favor.
¿Por favor?
Aah!
Well, we've gone straight.
What'll we try now?
There are other ways of going straight, you know.
There are other ways of going straight.
There's farming.
We could buy a place.
I don't know how to farm.
What about a ranch, then?
I don't know.
The last time we tried ranching was during our rustling days.
Even then, we weren't much good at it.
It's hard.
Hours are brutal.
No, you got to be a kid to start a ranch.
Hey.
Hmm?
I might go back ahead of you.
You mean home?
I was thinking of it.
Whatever you want, Etta.
Maybe I'll go.
Hey.
Hmm?
Etta's thinking of, uh, maybe going home ahead of us.
Whatever she wants.
I'll go, then.
¡Manos arriba!
How much you got?
It's hardly worth it.
Alpoca mine.
I tell you, no more jungle work for me.
You're getting to be an old maid.
Keep your old maid remarks to yourself.
I'll work in the city, in the mountains, but from now on jungle work is out.
¿Bandidos yanquis?
Mm-hmm.
Tell them to be quiet.
What's the word?
Quietas.
Quietas.
I tell you, the jungle's a better cover for payrolls.
Kid, I got a right to my opinion, and in my opinion, there are snakes in the jungle.
I don't work around snakes.
What is this place?
I don't know.
San Vincente,
I think.
¿Comer?
Si, Señor.
Pasen.
Juan, ven.
Llévate los caballos.
I don't enjoy jungles.
I don't enjoy swamps.
I don't like snakes.
I don't much care for night work.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
¡Capitán! ¡Capitán!
Capitán, allá en la plaza,
hay una mula de las minas de Alpoca.
¿Las minas de Alpoca?
Sí, sí. Allí están.
Dos hombres la acaban de traer.
Están comiendo en el restaurante de mi papá.
El guisado está delicioso.
Para chuparse los dedos.
Si quieren mas, es la especialidad de la casa,
si quieren mas,
no tengan pena y díganmelo.
Yo estoy aquí para servirles.
Agradezco la visita de tan distinguidos caballeros.
Muchas gracias.
Para servirles.
Muchas gracias.
Sí.
The specialty of the house, and it's still moving.
Well, that settles it.
This place gets no more of my business.
Hey.
What?
What do you think?
I bet it's just one guy.
Don't you get sick of being right all the time?
Reloading.
That's all I got.
We're going to run out unless we can get to that mule and get some more.
I'll go.
This is no time for bravery.
I'll let you.
Loaded.
Hell!
I'm the one that has to go.
Why you?
'Cause I could never give you cover.
You can cover me.
You can see I'm right, can't you?
You go.
Yeah, why am I always so damn smart?
Here.
Go.
O.K.
Go.
Ah!
Is... Is that what you call giving cover?
Is that what you call running?
If I knew you were going to stroll...
You never could shoot, not from the very beginning.
And you are all mouth.
Jefe, llega el ejército.
Mi capitán.
¿Dónde están?
Allí en la plaza.
¿Cuántos hombres son?
Dos hombres.
¿Dos hombres?
Mi capitán, por favor...
¿Dos?
Bandidos yanquis.
¿Bandidos yanquis, eh?
Sí, mi capitán.
Hmm.
Sargento Rico,
desmonten 20 hombres
y vayan con el teniente.
I've got a great idea where we should go next.
I don't want to hear it.
You'll change your mind.
Shut up!
OK, O.K.
Your ideas got us here.
Forget it!
I never want to hear another of your ideas.
All right.
O.K.
Australia.
I figured secretly you wanted to know, so I told you.
Australia.
That's your great idea?
Oh, boy, it's the latest in... in a long line.
Australia's no better than here.
Aw, that's all you know.
Name me one thing.
They speak English in Australia.
They do?
That's right, smart guy.
So we wouldn't be foreigners.
They got horses in Australia.
They got thousands of miles we could hide out in.
And a good climate, nice beaches.
You could learn to swim.
No!
Swimming isn't important.
What about the banks?
They're easy.
Easy, ripe, and luscious.
The banks or the women?
Well, once you've got one, you've got the other.
It's a long way, isn't it?
Aw! Everything's got to be perfect with you.
I don't want to get there and find out it stinks.
At least think about it.
All right.
I'll think about it.
Hey.
When we get outside... and we get to the horses, just remember one thing.
Hey, wait a minute.
What?
You didn't see LeFors out there, did you?
LeFors?
No.
Oh, good.
For a moment there,
I thought we were in trouble.
¡Fuego!
¡Fuego!
¡Fuego!
I surrender!
Don't kill me, Silence!
I quit being a bounty hunter.
I swear.
Damn you! My hands!
You ruined my hands!
Come!
Even dead those bounty hunters give me the creeps.
You came just in time.
Take this.
Those bastards ambush everytime we're in the valley getting some food.
They know we'd starve here without the food
If we would defend ourselves the bounty would rise and there's be a massacre.
At least you could thank me.
This guy almost shot you.
Your bullet was wasted, trust me.
This bastard couldn't have used a gun without his thumb.
That's why Silence didn't kill him.
For the others it was self defense.
He knew they'd ambush him, but he was faster.
Why someone else has to defend us?
We got guns.
Let's go into town and send those damn bounty hunters to hell.
It's us or them.
At least there'll be an end to it.
Listen, my friends:
Many of us are innocent.
It's unfair to have a price on our heads.
The new governor promised amnesty to us.
You have to bear up a little longer.
- I give up.
I'll go into town.
I'd rather be captivated.
I'll surrender myself.
At least it's warm in jail.
Wait, I'll join you.
Me too.
They think they'll get amnesty in jail.
- If they make it that far.
Miguel!
Where is the lawyer, Mom?
- There he is.
I couldn't take any more.
I didn't tell the others.
But I followed your advice.
You are very smart to trust in the law.
I'm glad you're helping me.
No... What are you doing?
Mom!
Miguel!
Miguel... my son!
You have to understand, that's how we make a living.
I take him to the sheriff.
Luckily his face wasn't hit. so you can still recognize him.
Come on, let's get the money Tigrero.
The money is all yours, you did it all on your own.
I get the other two, enough for all of us.
Beware!
They killed five of our men.
The amnesty triggered a manhunt.
There's got to be an end to bounty hunting.
Surely, Mr. Governor, but...
- What?
Bounty Hunters are people... who act upon the law.
It's not easy to control a big area like this.
It is for you, sheriff.
You're the second best shooter in the state, aren't you?
Sure. Only because I avoided to challenge the best.
Right. Citizens have to believe in law and order again.
Put an end to the wild west.
Bounty hunters, outlaws and sheriffs are united in a better world.
In a world in which...
Before an election a governor pardons even the murderer of his president.
What do you mean, sheriff?
I don't quite understand.
Nothing. Just thinking out loud.
A good soldier doesn't think.
- Sure. Don't think, just act.
Let's go to Snow Hill...
Utah.
Enough! Please stop!
Believe me, Tigrero, I know nothing.
Tell me where I find him.
- I don't know him.
Of cause you do, he was with you in the mountains.
I don't know where he is now.
I beg you, let me go!
I don't know him.
Stop!
Believe me, Tigrero!
I don't know anything!
Don't lie to me.
I'll find out anyway.
At the mill.
Out of town.
Where his wife lives.
He's armed.
Many thanks.
I'm the resurrection and the life.
He who believes in me, will never die. Amen.
You have to have patience if you're waiting for the stagecoach.
It snowed a lot in the mountains.
So it'll be late.
Want some food while you're waiting?
Thanks, I'll bring you some.
I know you, stranger.
You help the weak.
Your pistol avenges the innocent.
My son was innocent, too.
They shot him down like so many others.
Avenge him, I beg you!
One of the murderers is gone, but the other is still in town.
I can only offer Miguel's horse for the life of this murderer.
Kill him, avenge my son!
You'll save other lifes.
Yes, I know.
Some get rewards up to 5000 Dollars.
My friend Tigrero for example makes... a lot of money.
But with this snow... it's hard work.
I eat and eat but I'm still freezing.
The doctor... said it's probably my blood.
He wanted to examine me.
But I don't give my blood to a doctor.
You're right, Charly.
That would bring bad luck.
Right.
Close the door I'm freezing!
Close the door, damn it!
Or you'll be cold, too... cold forever. Do you hear me?
Close the door or I kill you.
Calm down, Charly.
He's a dangerous man.
I don't care, I shoot.
Close that damn door!
Close it...
What now, are we gonna arrest him?
- No, Charly drew first.
The stranger shot in self defense.
So the law can't touch him.
Maybe. But you have to draw faster as the devil himself.
Maybe he was the devil.
You're wasting your time.
My husband's not here.
I know, but I won't risk my life for 1000 Dollars.
When he sees you he'll be calm.
Take me to him.
I won't do that, get out!
Come on, get a move on!
Come out if you love your wife!
Move!
I want you alive.
I'll get the bounty anyway.
What are you afraid of?
Surrender yourself!
Bastard.
Throw your gun and put your hands up!
Now cover your ex-husband with snow.
It will keep his body fresh.
You mustn't bury him before I got the money.
Don't forget that?
He's worth quite a sum.
What times we're living in!
A black man is worth more than a white man.
Help!
My husband has been murdered, please help!
Boss... he's been brought in.
Pauline... my god, the poor soul!
You have to be strong.
- Don't cry!
Pollicut!
You bastard! You keep yourself nice and warm, don't you?
While this poor soul died because of you!
It's you, you bastard... you that profits the most from the bounty.
This man was an outlaw.
He didn't deserve better.
That doesn't count for Pauline.
She can have everything from me.
Son of a bitch!
She'd be better off with a rabid dog!
Move!
Come on... move!
Move already.
Goddamn.
Get a move, come on!
Stupid horse!
Move!
I'm the new sheriff.
I don't have money.
Nada dinero!
If you kill me you'll all hang.
Move and I'll shot you.
You can't kill me.
Your gun is frozen, sheriff.
We're experienced enough to keep our weapons warm... and we know how to use them.
Just move and I'll bash your heads in!
Don't be afraid, we don't want to kill you.
What do you want then?
- Your horse, sheriff.
Why? There are so many of you, what use could just one horse be?
Beefsteak.
We can eat for one week.
You can move to my place.
- It's no use.
I just want one thing:
Revenge, even at the cost of my own life.
There was a price on your husband's head because of Pollicut.
He gave him no work so he was forced to steal.
Maybe.
But the real murderer is Tigrero.
I want his life for that of my husband.
There is one man all the bounty hunters are afraid of.
They call him Silence...
Because he's accompanied by silence and death.
We're late.
Hey! Stop!
Someone's there.
I'm the sheriff around here.
I have to get away from here.
I don't care where you're going to, take me to Snow Hill.
That's not where we're going.
- I don't care!
Take me to Snow Hill! Quick!
I'm sorry, but I have to go to Snow Hill.
It's very urgent.
I'm the new sheriff.
As if I haven't enough problems already.
Now this damn cold!
I know what you think.
What am I doing here in the middle of nowhere without a horse.
But... I had a horse.
Outlaws took it.
To eat it.
Change the horses, quick.
If the blizzard catches us we'll be stuck here.
Please give me a hand.
I'll buy you a drink.
I take the big one.
He's heavy!
Up you go!
Hey you!
That's no way to transport dead bodies.
There are rules.
I'm the new sheriff of Snow Hill.
I noticed your star.
Though you look like you raise cattle.
But with your star you look like a ranger who plays sheriff.
Who is this joker?
Tigrero. Better not get too acquainted with him.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Wait.
I think I have to refresh your memory.
Dead bodies may only be transported in wood or metal coffins.
Article 15 in...
These are no ordinary dead bodies.
- No?
What kind of dead bodies are they?
Two outlaws I killed and bring to Snow Hill.
I want to fetch the bounty before they begin to rot.
Excuse me.
There are four on the poster.
Who are the ones on the roof? the second and the third.
Another one is already in town.
He'll be buried once I have my money.
They are wanted dead or alive.
You prefer 'em dead I guess.
Alive they are expensive. That's why there is the other option.
Furthermore it would be dangerous.
Those outlaws are against god, our moral, law and order.
They deserve to die.
Stop, please!
What's the matter?
I have another dead body.
Help me, I can't do it alone.
- What's he doing now?
Come here, please!
Get him up!
I killed him two days ago.
The snow conserved him.
He's only worth 500 Dollars, but that's better than nothing.
Well, money is money.
You have to prepare for retirement.
Who knows if you're gonna live that long.
Some day you might meet someone who draws faster than you.
That will be a day of joy.
Really.
Come here, the stagecoach arrived!
See you next time my friend.
I hope you'll be more talkative then.
Here's your saddle.
I thought Snow Hill would be bigger.
If it snows on like this it'll be even smaller tomorrow.
That man there with the horse...
I want to know where he goes.
- OK.
Don't let your retirement money lie there in the street.
Either bury them or take them home, got that?
If you pay me now they're all yours.
Mine? I don't need them.
Do you think I am the gravedigger?
I don't like your face and your attitude.
So beware, or you'll end like them.
Good evening, sheriff.
Welcome in Snow Hill.
I see you are able to command respect for yourself.
And who the hell are you?
You didn't guess it yet?
I'm Edwin Pollicut.
This is my store.
They must have told you about myself.
I'm afraid not. Are you that important?
What else do you do besides the store?
I'm the magistrate.
We will work together.
Shall we finish the deal?
You pay me the bounty and we're done.
I'm done already.
Come to my office tomorrow and put your corpses away now.
Yes, I wrote this.
Come in.
I thought you'd look different.
Of cause that's not important.
Have a seat.
I want you to kill a man.
How much do you want for this job?
Answer me at least.
Can't you talk?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.
1000 Dollars. Who is it?
Tomorrow... or the day after tomorrow
I'll have the money.
I just need some time.
It's Tigrero, the bounty hunter.
He travelled with you in the stagecoach.
He killed my husband.
Also for 1000 Dollars.
No. If I shall kill him you have to put a price on his head.
You don't do it for nothing.
It's for your own good.
He's an enemy of the bounty hunters.
I know him. A dreamer who wants to make the world a better place with his gun.
His method is brilliant.
He draws second... but shoots first.
But one day he'll die, too.
But he wants to kill you.
Pauline brought him here.
He wants to challenge you.
That means nothing to me.
That thumb-shooter... won't kill me in self defense.
Maybe he has come to get you.
You should catch yourself that beautiful black girl now, idiot.
I got rid of her husband.
What more do you want?
If you need a killer ask your servant.
Tomorrow a few collegues of mine will arrive.
You can stay here tonight.
So nobody will see you around.
There's a bed near the stairs.
Good night.
Proof you're innocent.
Don't take the law into your own hands.
For your son's sake!
Gordon, get out. It's the sheriff.
Resistance is fertile.
You're better off in jail.
Or we'll give you a lead treatment.
There's a price on your head.
Surrender yourself.
Throw away your gun!
A good lawywer will proof you're innocent.
Alright, sheriff, I surrender.
Mom! Mom!
The boy betrayed us.
No.
He'll never talk again.
First the corpses, then the money, that's the regulations.
Because the law needs proper proof,
Tigrero always has the wanted poster with the dead body.
Everything done by the books.
That may well be.
But why do you care?
You only have to lend me the money so I can pay him.
True, but I'll get 25% of the sum
A little income provided by the state.
That's the law.
As well as a prompt payment or am I wrong?
Pay him for all I care.
And get rid of the dead bodies!
They start to smell.
That would be... two for 500... and two for 1000.
That's 3000 altogether.
There are only three outside so why to you pay him four?
Why four?
- because there are... four of them.
I only see three.
I left the black man here but his wife buried him.
Everybody in town knows it.
- Yes, it's true.
That's not according to regulations.
First the corpses, then the money, didn't you say so?
I'll see into it and confiscate the money.
I'll have to hear the widow and start investigating.
After that I'll write a letter to the governor.
He'll see that it reaches the right office.
That's the way you like it, right??
All done by the books.
It's cold, isn't it?
If the weather goes on like this you better go back to africa.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.
Oh... Pauline.
What can I do for you?
You want to buy something?
I don't want to buy,
I want to sell.
Sell what?
- My house.
It's worth at least 5000 Dollar.
You can have it for 1000.
You like a good bargain.
Follow me.
Take care of the store.
- Ok, boss.
May I ask what you need the money for?
- No.
No problem.
I think I know anyway.
Murderers are expensive.
- None of your concern.
Are you interested in my offer?
No, Pauline.
I'm not how you think I am.
I won't take advantage of your misery.
No... I'd like to help.
Go to hell.
Not bad my friend.
But still could be better.
How's that?
Oh yes, I heard about it.
A kind of machine-gun.
But not very precise.
Very good. Too good.
I wonder what kind of business a gunman like you has here.
You're not one of those dirty bounty hunters?
I asked you something.
I'm the sheriff so you better answer me.
Who are you? Where are you from?
How long are you staying?
Don't try to get smart with me.
Are you going to answer me now?
He can't, he's mute.
You could have at least said so,
I mean... showed it to me somehow.
Listen...
I'd like to know something.
They say you buried your husband.
After a bounty hunter shot him.
Well... is it true?
- Yes.
What was his name?
- James Middleton.
No, the bounty hunter.
- Tigrero.
20 and another 20.
- I pass.
Corner Straight.
- Well done.
Ok, Revanche!
Let's double the ante.
Of cause it's cold, the oven went out.
Don't get all excited, you won't win anything from me.
You promised us to get rich in Snow Hill.
But there's not even the shadow of an outlaw here.
Relax, Schulz.
Hunger will drive those outlaws into town.
It'll be so many that you won't have enough bullets for them.
Such a cold!
Need a match?
- Thanks.
Greetings to you!
May I introduce my friends to you?
I don't care... if this are your friends.
Here's your money.
How nice of you to come by and give it to me personally.
I'm not nice, I want you to leave this town quickly.
But that's not what I'm planing to do.
The air is fresh, I like the view.
And I like the sheriff
The view will change very soon.
And even the air will become thick for you all.
Whiskey.
I didn't get the money.
But I still want my revenge.
That doesn't mean...
You have to do it for nothing.
There is someone who would give me the money.
Even more than I need.
But he wants me to... well...
I think you know what.
But that's too high a price.
But I'd pay you the price.
Now, before... after... whenever you want.
I pass.
Always winning, Tigrero.
Eventually your friends will sit here with only their pyjamas on.
But beware: maybe you'll be the one.
Having a pyjama made of wood.
Being in this dirty business you have to be prepared for the worst.
Every profession has its risks and its rules.
And you're going to keep those rules, is that clear?
Otherwise I'll make those wooden pyjamas for you.
Do you buy me a drink?
No, if I stay any longer
I have to puke.
Let's go outside then.
- Yes.
I open.
- I'm in.
I raise to 300.
- I stay.
Ok.
Me too.
I stay.
Once more.
How many cards?
Two please.
I'll take three.
Two for me.
Two cards.
One for me.
200 Dollars.
I'm out.
- Me too.
300 and we have a game.
I pass.
Me too.
500 Dollars.
Listen, mute, you hope that I draw first, am I right?
This is your method, I know.
But it won't work with me.
If someone draws first it's you.
Don't count on me.
On the contrary.
Since I don't want to take a risk...
Jack will take off my belt.
I really think... that the day of joy has come.
I hope I didn't hurt you.
You are under arrest, Tigrero.
Without me you would have fired.
You can't keep me here.
- I know you.
Can't I be released on bail?
- It's 100 Dollars.
My money is in the saloon.
Also the 3000 Dollars from you.
It's not yours anymore.
It's confiscated.
Give me the money.
I'd give you 2000.
Very well. Now you tried to bribe me.
So bail is now 5000 Dollars.
You don't like me killing outlaws.
But you do the same.
That's different.
I act on the law.
How come?
- It's not murder it's punishment.
Killing outlaws shouldn't be a business but a warning.
Amen.
- Shut up!
Sheriff, these are Tigreros things.
This money was in the saloon.
Thanks.
That's very nice of you, Regine.
Would you drink... some coffee with me?
- Sure, I'll pour some.
A man like you should always be served by a woman like myself.
You're really very kind.
It would be nice if you'd serve me some coffee every once in a while.
Regine likes to serve men.
With her body she'd make a whole regiment of sheriffs happy.
You don't talk like that to a lady.
I'm awfully sorry!
I demand the release of this man.
Why?
It's the wish of the citizens of
Snow Hill. I have a delegation.
What about bail?
- I'll pay.
Does his freedom mean so much to you?
In the mountains many outlaws are waiting for an unconstitutional amnesty.
The bounty hunters protect the town.
To protect the town is my job.
- There's more to it.
One of the killed was Klaus Schulz.
His brother Bodo is the best gunman in Nevada.
Bodo Schulz won't be satisfied unless he's had his revenge.
In short, Sheriff:
If you don't release Tigrero his friends will get to him, and than... all hell would break loose.
That's what you think.
Now listen carefully:
Nothing will happen at all.
Those outlaws you're afraid of are just some hungry beggars.
Give them a carriage with food and they won't do any harm.
About Bodo Schulz...
If he wants to get close to Tigrero he'll have to come to Tonota.
That's where I'll transfer him.
Boss! The outlaws are coming.
The sheriff will transfer Tigrero.
Our hero threatens us with Bodo Schulz.
That's just a fairytale.
Bodo couldn't possibly know they killed his brother.
But the outlaws?
They are on their way to the town.
Stupid talk. Do as I tell you and nothing will happen.
Put all the food in a carriage in front of the town.
A full stomach doesn't steal. stay in your houses, understood?
Come on, let's go!
Unbelievable. Now criminals are treated with bread.
When will law and reason rule this town again?
The day you hang.
Is this bastard badly injured?
I think so.
He must have lost a lot of blood.
Let's hope he dies.
Where is he now?
- In the house of that black woman.
We're riding to slow.
You're mute friend could follow us and shoot me from behind.
The mute is injured and doesn't shoot from behind.
I'm worried though.
Let's ride on the other side. alright. As long as I get you to the prison in Tonota.
Look, sheriff.
The outlaws. Take off my handcuffs.
Quick!
I won't do that.
These people are just hungry.
Just smile at them.
Damn murderer!
Today my weapon's warm and as you can see it works.
Listen my friends.
Soon you'll get amnesty.
Then you can go home.
Don't make any trouble.
Before the town some food is waiting for you.
Go to Snow Hill and eat.
Just spare us our horses this time.
They would be hard to digest.
Is there really food?
- You have my word for it.
Let's get back, sheriff.
We could await them at the carriage and shoot every single one of them.
One is not worth that much but altogether they're a good deal.
I don't beat up a captive.
But if you continue talking like that you force me to.
I really meant that.
You saved me and I wanted to make up for it.
Listen.
One more word of you and you'll regret it.
My husband was an honest man.
He was accused of stealing because he wanted to care for me.
Pollicut put a price on his head.
He hoped I'd become his mistress.
But he was wrong.
Pauline!
We are collecting food for the outlaws.
Could you give us something?
I'll have a look.
Good. Take your time.
Greetings to Silence.
Just take all.
We don't like people like you.
You want to get rid of the bounty?
- No, but crime.
America has to ruled by law and not by violence.
You know, sheriff...
What?
I have to applaud to your prophetic vision.
When you swing at the gallows
I'll applaud you.
I need a break.
- What for?
To take a shit.
But with...
Alright.
Thanks, sheriff.
Go... but be quick.
It was really very urgent.
I won't wait for long, understood?
So, Tigrero, ready?
- Please.
We're running late.
I want to cross the ice before dusk.
I don't like to travel at night.
Don't worry we'll make it.
Hands up, sheriff!
Tigrero, quit playing games!
You'll hang for murdering a sheriff.
I'm no fool!
You'll be buried under the ice, and I'll continue to carry out the only true law. The law of the strong.
Relax friends. Since when do wolves feed on each other?
Hello Tigrero!
Who handcuffed you?
The most sympathetic sheriff from the state.
Help me.
Ah... the sheriff of Snow Hill.
A dirty braggart.
He was.
Now he's no longer dirty.
I let him have a nice bath.
He didn't get out of the water.
May his soul rest in peace.
He couldn't swim.
Now we are the law in Snow Hill.
At least now we can carry on with our work.
I have a great idea.
Absolutly legal.
I met the outlaws.
They are on their way to the town.
We just have to ambush them and we get them all at once.
Someone else is waiting for us in Snow Hill... who you like to kill for sure:
The mute.
The thumb shooter.
If it involves a dead sheriff
I don't want to join.
Did you know that the mute killed your brother?
Klaus?
He didn't... have time to defend himself.
Let's go.
No!
Let go of me!
Coward!
No!
Look at this hand!
Remember?
It was a normal hand. Now it can't hold a pistol anymore.
But for what I'm going to do
I don't need a pistol.
No! Help!
Help!
My dear!
Pauline!
Tigrero rode to town with five other men.
They are looking for Silence.
Do you understand? You have to escape!
Save yourselves!
If they find you they kill you.
But he's wounded.
He can't move.
We have to hide him.
- I beg you, help me!
Tigrero!
The mute shot Pollicut.
He's in the house of the black woman.
Go there and kill him.
Avenge us.
Don't move, Tigrero!
One false move and I kill you!
Throw your gun, bitch, or I'll send you to your beloved sheriff.
Disgusting coward, you killed him!
You've all seen it, she shot first.
Look for the mute, he can't have gone far.
Quick!
You have to find them.
There's not a soul here.
Here neither.
We searched everything.
The house is empty.
We'll find him eventually.
The outlaws are here!
They're near the town.
Let's go! We'll take care of the mute later!
I'll try to warn them.
You have to hide yourself here.
Let's go my friends! There is the food, just like the sheriff promised.
Don't shoot!
If we want to catch the mute we need them alive.
Surrender! You are surrounded!
Throw your weapons or we'll kill you!
Let's go, move!
Quick!
Get down!
Your backs against the bar!
I want Silence to show up... and deal with me.
If he kills me... you're all free.
My friends have agreed.
My life for all the others.
Tell him! You know where he is.
I was too late.
I tried but...
Tigrero already captivated them.
They are still alive but tied up like cattle.
Tigrero catched me as I tried to escape.
He said he'll kill them all if you don't show up.
But... you mustn't go there.
It's a trap for sure.
You are wounded and there's six of them.
Alone one is powerless... against the violence.
Let us escape together.
I don't want them to kill you,
I love you.
What are you waiting for?
Let's go through with it.
Kill us all.
Silence won't come anyway.
Kill us, murderer!
He's here.
No!
You coward!
No, have mercy!
We don't want to die!
There is still the bounty to get.
We'll collect it later.
All according to the law.
After the massacre of Snow Hill in 1898 bounty hunters were condemned publicly
A memorial in Snow Hill had the following inscription:
The boots of men may raise the dust of this place for 1000 years.
But nothing can make the blood of those poor victims disappear.

This film is dedicated to the rough diamond heroes of the Wild West who avenged wrongs and defended the law.
Stop the scrapping, boys!
Now we'll tap another barrel...
...the barrel of art!
Let me introduce our famous Arizona artist
Miss Tornado Lou!
She must be mine!
As the smoke thickens in the bar when I sit over my liquor.
I dream that one day he'll come, the champion of my heart.
To him I'll give gladly, gladly, what a maid prizes most highly.
Should he one day appear,
As the smoke thickens in the bar.
What's she saying?
Something about smoke in the bar.
What bloke?
Smoke! Too much smoke!
As the smoke thickens in the bar when I sit over my liquor.
I dream that one day he'll come, the champion of my heart.
Today you are my guests... gentlemen!
A shaker!
Lou, you must be mine!
I dream that he will come, the champion of my heart.
And why not me? Doug Badman -
Owner of the damn prosperous
Trigger Whisky Saloon!
I dream of a man who'd make me different, better.
Huh, dreams!
Then I would know what love is, that sacred feeling.
That's for sure!
A double shaker!
Hearken, dear friends, hearken!
The Arizona Revival calls you!
There, a substitute for you, dear man.
Read and you shall be blessed with my blessing.
Read and when you've read you'll never touch a drop of spirits again.
The Arizona Revival.
The society of Brothers and Sisters that will deliver you from the slavery of drink!
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
Gentlemen! Do you think your Wild West will be less wild if you fill your glasses with fresh milk or spring water instead?
Quite the opposite.
Quite the opposite.
Give up drink and you'll be quicker on the trigger.
Be frank, Pistol!
Spirits don't steady hand or eye...
Am I right, daddy?
Oh, my fiddle, my fiddle!
The kitten shows her claws!
Let's give her some milk!
A shaker for the little miss!
And for me a glass of Kolaloka lemonade.
You said Kolaloka lemonade, stranger?
I said it, Old Pistol!
Then you are - Lemonade Joe!
So what?
I think the young lady and this gentleman are waiting for your apologies, Pistol!
You'd better kneel on your dirty knees and call yourself a scabby coyote, you stinky old skunk!
...by the time I count three.
If you don't apologize my
Smith and Wesson is going to speak up.
And they're slung damn low.
Right. One! Two! Three!
That's him, my heart's champion.
Ladies present, Pistol!
Thanks, noble protector.
I'm Ezra Goodman and this is my daughter Winnifred.
They call me Lemonade Joe.
And me, the Arizona Goldfinch.
Tornado Lou - artist!
I asked for a glass of Kolaloka.
Or rather a Trigger Whisky on the house?
I don't touch spirits on principle.
Alcohol has never been a gunman's friend!
It ruins your body and especially your accurate aim.
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!
So, barman, a glass of Kolaloka lemonade.
Same for me! Same for me...
We don't stock Kolaloka.
If you'll allow
I'll help myself from my own reserves.
Thank you, Mr. Kolalok!
Don't go yet!
I'm coming back.
No need!
And not alone, Doug Badman,
The Law will be coming with me!
Brother revivalist
Go, Arizona, go!
If I'm not mistaken you're a member of the Arizona Revival?
No. I'm a lone wolf.
Ooh!
You're the Defender of the Law!
The avenger of Wrongs!
Fine weather, isn't it?
Yes, very good, indeed.
Marvellous.
Bunglers! Not a corpse!
If it only keeps up.
Well, we could do with a little rain.
Mister Pistol wanted the weather to stay fine, Daddy.
Help, robbers!
Do you like shooting, Miss...?
Winnifred.
A lovely name.
Really a lovely name.
We want Kolaloka!
We want Kolaloka!
Now do you believe in its beneficial effects?
Firm as a rock.
Have faith, my friends, have faith!
Faith works miracles.
Why shouldn't it bring a supply of
Kolaloka from the firm Kolaloka&Son?
Adiós!
Do you love him, daughter?
Yes, I do!
Tornado Lou - tigress, storm, fate and Lemonade Joe, such a softy!
Don't be vulgar!
Joe alone will make me different, better.
To him alone, dear Mother, shall I entrust the treasure of my maidenhood.
After a proper wedding, of course!
I've run out my Kolaloka. Oh, my God!
Mr. Goodman, telegram!
Mr. Goodman! Telegram!
Mr. Goodman! Telegram!
Sending you ten trucks lemonade.
Long term credit...
Appointing you the general agent for Stetson City
Kolaloka&Son
Oh, Hosanna.
Arizona, Arizona that's where all true men come from.
Cards flip-flipping, bullets buzzing.
Cows moo-mooing full of feeling.
I'm happy and content as a fish in it's element.
The race of Arizona men are polite to us women.
Gentlemen with a blow teach ruffians manners before they know.
And in the course of progress shoot from the hip and never miss.
Wham! Bang!
When a drinker of Kolaloka shoots no need to call a doctor.
Oh, whither has he gone, of my desires, the champion?
I dream, I dream, I'll be with him, of my life, he's fine cream.
Let him go, my darling!
Business is bad but I'm still disgustingly rich.
Let's go to Europe for a trip.
Paris, Monte Carlo, Carlsbad!
Old Pistol will carry our trunks.
Serve the Stranger.
You've insulted a lady!
I didn't see any.
The gentleman's vegetarian?
Give them back to the lad when he starts behaving. brother!
Bro-brother? A cocoa mark...
The size of a Mexican dollar!
Our common birthmark.
Horác!
Doug!
Such long time...
Since we shared the sad fate of foundlings.
Found in the prairie by damnably rough diamond buffalo-killers.
Since we tramped through the gay towns of the frontier.
Dodge City! Abilene!
When we robbed mail coaches...
...and raided banks
...and shot sheriffs!
The happy days of youth!
Place isn't exactly crowded.
Anything I can do to help, Doug?
Cut-throat competition.
Phew!
''Did you say ''''phew'''', stranger?''
Yes, phew!
Phew to Kolaloka lemonade?
Yes, phew to Kolaloka lemonade.
He's crazy.
An anarchist.
Neither one, nor the...
Hogofogo!
Hogofogo!
Yes, Hogofogo! With 12 nicks on the butt of his Derringer.
Sought by the police in five states!
And arrested in Stetson City!
How embarrassing, you've won.
Hogofogo?!
Hey, barman, a proper drink for a proper triggerman.
You mean Kolaloka lemonade?
No! I mean Trigger Whisky.
We don't stock hard drinks.
A big mistake. Alcohol in small doses is harmless in whatever quantity.
Do I wake or dream?
I'll rub off your bloom, my little peach.
I'm stuck by Cupid's bolt.
Where can I heal my heartache with a glass of Trigger Whisky? Where?
At the Trigger Whisky saloon, triggerman!
Oh, where shall I find the company of real men?
At the same place!
By the way. I think they need changing, demoiselle.
Go ahead, gentlemen, go ahead!
Whisky, that's the stuff, I say without it my heart's dry as hay.
If my Dad had drunk more of it he would've been alive today.
When whisky shines in a glass,
Barman's profits are vast.
Life's worth living when men who're thirsty can call for a glass of good Scotch whisky.
That round bottle, that colourful label, the golden whisky makes Manitu unstable.
Why, a man who's worth his meat drinks his whisky and drinks it neat.
And so we men sing strong hereby.

I'll take this!
No! Not that one!
Yes! Just that one!
Oh, mother dear, shall I be his?
Of course you'll be mine.
Here, on holy soil, my dove.
You Spider!
My little fawn!
You reptile!
Enough zoology!
So now you know all.
Defender of the Law. Avenger of Wrongs.
And in fact...
In fact I travel in lemonade.
Any objection?
What made you think that?
Accredited agent for Kolalok&Son for the whole of the south west?
With a salary of 1,000 dollars nett.
And a 10% premium gross!
Darling!
I am yours. If I get 5% of the premium.
Hmm...
Four...
You can have an even 4 1/2, sweetheart.
But am I worthy of you?
Are you woman or angel?
No! Not now!
I understand, here in a cemetery.
I don't care about the cemetery but... but my Dad's business may fold up any minute.
What's happened?
Don't you see my moist lips, and my bosom heaving?
My heart's all aflame and yours is frost.
How with love my heart is cracking!
My life is on fire.
When I fall in love it's deadly serious.
I'm lost when I see a man.
But can you blame the heart?
I said I'd be back, Doug Badman... and that I'd bring the Law with me.
Or Kolaloka.
Kolaloka- that's the Law.
I'm not armed, triggerman.
Waste of bullets for you, trickster.
Can't you see my moist lips, my trembling shoulder.
Wind me closer to your cruel heart and take your plunder.
Alas, my reputation is as black as may be - as black as pitch black tar!
Don't shoot!
Thank you, I can manage this myself.
Shoot - don't shoot - shoot! Don't shoot
- shoot - don't shoot!
Shoot! Don't shoot!
Carry out the lady!
We've still got a bone to pick, you whisky bibber!
Yes sir.
Engaged.
Time enough.
Once again Good has conquered Evil.
Thanks to what? Kola-
Kolaloka lemonade!
Thanks to Kolaloka the teetotaller is the winner!
And the boozer is the loser.
What's he saying?
Oh, same play on words. The drunk lost.
He certainly looks pretty disjointed.
And he'll come apart even more when he hears that.
Oh, ye gods, what a divine drink is this Kolaloka!
With a Smith and Wesson at my hip
Winnifred: Everybody for Kolaloka?
A glass of Kolaloka I do sip.
No need of bread and butter, no need of lovely women.
My daily bread, my seventh heaven is Kolaloka and no other.
Winnifred: Everybody for Kolaloka?
Joe: What smoke is for a Colt, what water is for a fish, what...oh, what do I know, what soda is for whisky, what rhyme is for a poem, what strophe is for a rhyme,
That, exactly that
Kolalo - o - ka is for me, that exactly is Kolaloka for me,
Kolaloka.
No! Here!
Kolaloka in your bed?
At least Kolaloka if nothing else.
Look Lou, they're worth 500 cows...
Fancy, 250 cattle beasties dangling at each ear.
It's more difficult to take than to give.
How easily I'd give him one.
Yes, I'd give in to him.
Only for whites, nigger!
Don't be crazy, they're at my heels!
Excuse my not knocking.
Do sit down.
Thank you. I'll stand.
But this gentleman'll sit down and sign at the dotted line.
I'm to sign this?
You'd better.
If you want to be quick on the trigger, then Kolaloka is your liquor!
Hogofogo. Thanks for the autograph.
We should drink on this.
With your permission.
A sip of spring water will also do.
Spirits!
I'm yours, Doug, if you spare him!
It's a deal!
But not for me!
To kill a defenceless man's a shame!
A shame?
The word is music to my ears.
Please!
There's nothing your average rogue likes so much as to pump lead into his enemy's guts...
Soon you'll lie there dead as mutton.
Worm-fodder in your wooden coffin...
Black deed of mine, be done, we know how to do it
We just put daylight through him.
We spray im with our guns.
Soon you'll lie there dead as mutton.
Sooner than you can say Jack Robinson...
Away you go, friend...
Yes, I'm yours. But go away now!
Where are they?
Gone!
How come I'm still alive?
I'm here, ain'l?
You've saved my life a second time.
Why?
Because I love you. Only you can make me different, better.
And what do you want for it?
For what?
For saving my life.
But I love you.
It'll cost me all the more.
Does One sell love?
Oh, you love me free of charge?
Unhappy creature.
How right, you wish to be different, better. Do you know what this is?
It's a cheque for 5 dollars.
Five dollars in words.
Give it a close look, perhaps it'll raise your morals.
How low you've sunk!
I hate you! I hate you!
Adios!
How I hate you!
Lincoln and Kolaloka, that's something new.
Where does the chap get the ideas?
Where? I ask you.
The town is full of it.
Joe must die.
I'm all for it!
But don't you love him any more?
I'll spit on his coffin.
So will I, but how do we get him into it?
You're a man, aren't you?
We're men, aren't we?
Anybody here?
Good folk.
Give a poor blind man a drink of refreshing, strengthening Kolaloka.
Horace, why the fancy dress?
Because it'll cost Joe dear.
Speak!
Not till tomorrow morning, in Main Street.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye.
Allow me to take you across, good man.
Get lost, you little bastard!
Allow me to take you across, good man.
God requite you, young man!
Oh, no!
Ma'am...
Not yet.
What is not now, can happen soon, miss.
Oh, the sidewalk.
God will requite you even more if you take me to Trigger Whisky saloon.
Trigger Whisky saloon?
You wonder what an old man wants there?
A humble living.
The piano needs tuning and I'm an old blind sick piano tuner.
I know every keyboard in Arizona.
And I tune and tune.
Which way? This way!
And I tune and tune.
God give you good earnings, good man.
As I can hear, nobody is in.
Oh, a sofa.
No, it's me.
Perhaps you'd better lead me to the piano.
It smells of vice here.
The foreign perfumes of fallen women.
Concert A is all that's left for me.
Oh, it seems to be very serious.
Goodbye, Mr. Tuner.
You're a great artist, poor man!
Used to be, used to be.
I soared on grand pianos to the highest spheres.
I played before crowned heads and then...
What then?
Bad company and spirits.
Damned spirits!
And then cards, young lady.
Squinting at other people's cards in poor lighting cost me my eyesight. And then...
What then?
Gwendolin, angelic Gwendolin took her fiancé's ruin so to heart that she pined and pined till...
Till...
Till what?
Till...
Till she pined away.
I see her as it were today.
A girl lies on the dissecting table and she lies there, white as snow the doctor says:
I'd have you know the lass is in a very poor way.
Today I found her stiff and stark beneath a white linen sack.
Tomorrow at the graveyard ten girls fair as fair.
But only nine out of ten will aye return from there.
Before my eyes, the world suddenly turned black.
What happens to me now
I don't care a brass tack.
But when I kick the bucket
I'll be buried in my best.
And all this luxury is needed so that above they'll know just what a lad I was.
How proud I lived when here on earth below.
But the funeral will only have proper pomp and show.
If at the four corners four hearties bear the pall.
My life being one black record of crime and lust and vice.
The girls from the speakeasies will accompany my hearse.
When they let down the coffin and dust returns to dust.
Then the band in black will deliver a final shattering burst.
This will be the proper ending for this heartrending blues.
Poor man, how you must have suffered!
Yes, I've suffered.
But I see - hear your hankie is soaking.
You've wept your golden heart into it.
May I offer you mine, clean and immaculate as yourself?
Th-thank you.
Inhale, my beauty, inhale!
Whither away?
What business is it of yours, milksop?
Quite a lot.
I'm engaged to Miss Goodman.
My name's Lemonade Joe.
My name's Doctor Quartz, family doctor.
What's happened to the young lady?
One over the eight.
And not for the first time either.
Impossible. She hates spirits.
Hates'em, does she?
Her favourites are - wood spirit, eau de cologne or either.
But her favourite of all is ether. Take a sniff!
Indeed.
Better give me a hand, dandy.
I'll treat her at my office.
Go to comfort her Papa, he'll need it.
And me too.
Courage, young man, courage!
Hi, blondie!
Lemonade Joe, any idea what a fool you are?
No, I haven't.
I'll tell you tonight at midnight...
... in Dead Man's Valley.
Your sweetheart will be there and that same night she'll become an object of my natural perversion.
I hope you'll come to congratulate me.
Sincerely yours Horace Badman, alias Dr. Quartz, alias Hogofogo.
The nights are cold!
What's that?
The nights are cold!
Yes, yes.
I'll need to put on my woollens.
Last year in Lincoln
Jim Stapleton played around.
Because he had a bit of fight the sheriff mitted him.
On their way to Santa Fe, Jim said:
No matter what you do
I'll breeze out of a place and will be free as a bird.
La,la,la,la
That evening in Johnny's bar we were sipping black coffee and thinking about old Jim in Santa Fe.
Then with a big bang a lantern was smashed... and the whole bar was suddenly pitch black.
A figure stood at the door and the air went cold, it was clear to everybody it was some kind of a ghost.
That moment in Santa Fe
I only say the bit that I know, just as he was climbing through the window poor old Jim was shot.
Stop him!
Idiots!
Some mistake, ma'am.
A truly inhospitable place.
We want a shot of us and him together.
Souvenir, souvenir...
I'll have a shot too!
You will see madam, how we have it figured out.
Nothing will help him this time.
Not even that...
This is for you from Horace.
Phew, Kolaloka. No, whisky!
Control your drinking, my friend, we haven't won yet.
The bait.
Why did you come, Miss?
I want to see his death!
Going to torture him?
Tell me all the details.
Really, very original torture.
And na-tur-ally...
Oh, how I hate him.
Hands up!
May I trouble you to collect the pop-guns?
How marvellous he is!
But he has to die.
I'll be back.
Oh, much obliged, ma'am.
If you want to be quick on the trigger then Kolaloka is your liquor!
Oh, what have I done?
I love him still!
Why aren't you eating?
It turns my stomach, your dirty tricks with that pure innocent girl.
Purity, innocence
- titbits for my lust.
Monster, were it not for that cocoa-mark size of a Mexican dollar,
I couldn't believe you were my brother!
Allow me to introduce my assistants.
Coyote Kid, Pancho Kid.
I'm not interested in your Kids.
You'll soon change your tune, my lad!
I'm a double-dyed butcher.
Torture's my delight!
No, no, no!
Don't listen, darling.
You should feel ashamed, gentlemen.
And then we'll fling you into that well.
Then I'd like you to mark it clearly:
Not for drinking!
He's a saint. I am bad, but little do you know how sad is the fate of a foundling.
And then love disdained.
Can you ever forgive me?
Poor little foundling.
I forgive you everything.
He forgives me.
All right, ma'am, but don't get in the way!
If you haven't the nerves for it, go home and don't get in the way.
When all is over
I'll send Horace a smoke signal:
Expect a visit from the deceased's fiancé.
Cigar!
Hey, milksop!
Say Kolaloka's a drink for wimps.
Stinky opossum!
Say it again!
Stinky opossum twice over!
Let's get going!
Bravo, bravo!
What's this sudden change, ma'am?
It was only a mere crisis of nerves.
But now I'll bring my grist to the mill.
And I forgave you.
Because you're a Simple Simon.
What about a souvenir shot?
I'll snap it for you.
Why not?
All nicely, in a row on the well there.
That's right - side view.
Mr. Coyote Kid a little forward.
Mr Gringo further back.
Ready- out flies the little bird!
Joe!
Winni!
I suffer and yet
I give you my blessing.
After all he was an enemy you could respect.
And what of my child?
She'll be the victim of my lowest instincts.
Oh, what a horror!
Poor Dad, have you forgotten that we might as well be the children of loving parents?
Loving, or not loving, the farce of life flies on... and nobody's interested in what happened in Act One.
Where are you off to?
To fluff up the nest of love.
...suggestive picture. a sensuous waltz and my personal charm guaranteed to soften the resistance of any woman.
Father!
Daughter!
Father-in-law!
Son-in-law!
What's she doing here?
Lou is different now, Dad.
Better.
She wants to fight for a more moral
Arizona.
Yes, I'll open a house of ill repute where only Kolaloka will be on sale.
I'm deeply touched.
A praiseworthy intention.
Excuse me. I must change...
Change?
The battle is not yet won.
She ought to be here any minute now.
Music!
Yes, sir!
When I tap the glass with a spoon...
Yes, sir!
Does the heat of passion make me so hot?
Why have you put off your usual colour?
This suits an avenger better.
My last will...should I not return.
No!
In which case give it to my Dad.
Mr. Charles William Kolalok
President of the company Kolalok&Son.
And you are...
His son.
Triggerman and factory-owner's son?
What more do you want, dear?
And his heir.
Universal?
Fortunately...unfortunately.
I'd have had brothers and sisters enough were it not for that fateful day when my parents moving to their new home in a covered wagon were overtaken by a hurricane.
The children were blown out and I've never seen them since...
And you weren't blown out?
No, you see, I wasn't born yet.
So now you know my whole story.
See you soon! Perhaps...
He'll come back, dear.
Not disturbing you? Interesting.
A man changed to stone.
Pulse still beating
- not quite hopeless
Damned bastard!
At last a warm human word.
Excuse my negligé.
Thank you, fruit only after my meal.
Let's sit down, shall we?
What do you want?
Only a little game of poker.
If you win, this toy is yours.
And also the right to have a fair triggerman's duel.
And if I lose?
I'll shoot you like a dog!
You've not right to kill me.
You forget you're a wanted man in 4 states.
But this is the fifth. nough said!
A gentleman doesn't play this way.
This is the way a gentleman plays with a rascal.
What rubbish.
How many cards do you want?
None, thanks. Good, I've three aces in reserve.
Dammit, where are they? in your other pocket.
Wait, I must go at it systematically.
Thank you for the conjuring number.
Two pair- and you?
You've lost, salad!
All right!
Pump lead into me ad lib.
Maybe I'll pump, maybe I won't pump.
If you want to be quick on the trigger then Kolaloka is your liquor.
I seem to have heard that one before.
Yes and you'll hear it again.
And if I sign?
You can go.
I thought you were a Defender of the Law?
What's good for Kolaloka is good for the Law.
I did not shun the foulest deed against you.
Life is a battle.
I wanted to dishonour your sweetheart.
It's all a matter of taste.
Will you sign?
Permit my sustaining glass of champagne.
By all means.
Yes, Mother dear, it's all fixed now.
I won't disturb your meditations.
I'll go gather a bunch of flowers for the grave.
That's what you think, my darling.
Devil!
Angel!
Brutal violence will triumph!
You nasty pig of a man!
First a sweet kiss and then...
Three guesses.
That's for you, you perfidious old rattlesnake!
What have you done?
Oh, a mere trifle.
Brother- and yet a monster.
Corkscrew!
Poor girl, your tornado-ing days are over.
Wait, is it possible? Co...Co... Cocoa...
Good afternoon.
Sorry, darling, for being late.
A cocoa mark the size of a Mexican dollar.
What do you see?
A cocoa mark the size of a Mexican dollar.
The same birthmark.
That means that Doug...
...was my brother.
...and look
A cocoa mark the size of a Mexican dollar.
Your sister.
And what about me?
Look!
A Mexican mark the size of cocoa dollar. No, the other way round.
Let's see! No!
Brother!
Goodbye for ever!
Good gracious, what a sight!
Only heart shot through twice, one in the stomach and so on.
A single drop was enough!
Wounds, shocks, corns, gall,
Kolaloka cures them all.
Thousands of grateful letters!
Recommended by medical authorities!
Even in cases of clinical death.
Dad!
Dad. That's her!
Let me clasp you to my bosom, little girl!
Oil!
Gold!
Mr. Kolalok, you've won 5 million on the stock exchange!
Billion!
Billion? Five billion dollars.
I knew that Good would conquer.
Touching. I could almost wish not to be a villain.
No, son, our business needs all kinds of talent.
Villain or hero, we're all one family.
And so...
And so...
And so...
Whiskola.
Alcohol-free!
Alcoholic!
Lemonade!
For alcoholics and teetotallers.
Whiskola.
Get down, damn it!
I'm no Apache.
Leave me be.
Where are you from?
Creel.
That's where I'm headed.
I'll get you home.
No. I've got to go to him. He needs me.
There's nothing but Apaches for 60 miles between here and Fort Creel.
The Apaches won't hurt me.
Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy.
Look.
There.
Good afternoon. What can I do for you?
Oh.
Did you find her?
- Where's the horse she was riding?
- Dead.
That's too bad.
- Take care of my horse.
- Where'd you find Mrs Grange?
Give him plenty of feed and water.
He needs it. And rub him down too.
- Hello, Harrington.
- Jess Remsberg.
- I see they've made you corporal again.
- Yeah, twice.
- Say, it's been a long time since...
- Yeah, yeah. It's been a long time.
- Is Scotty McAllister out at the fort?
- Yeah. Did you hear he made lieutenant?
- Tell him I'm in here, will you?
- Sure.
Well, look at 'em out there.
Watching, waiting to see how I'm going to take it.
Laughing behind my back.
When they brought you back the first time I tried to treat you decent.
This time the Apaches didn't take you away, you ran away.
My horse is dead and you're back.
Should be the other way around.
Stop it, Ellen.
Stop that.
Please. Oh, please.
Please, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that. I didn't.
I'm sorry, Will. I'm sorry I was brought back to shame you.
I don't like the way I feel.
I hate myself for it.
- You know how I loved you.
- You were always good to me.
When Chata's band took you I just near went out of my head.
I hunted for you for a whole year until I figured they'd killed you.
Then suddenly you were back and
I wanted us to start over.
- There's something that happened to me.
- I don't want to hear what happened!
I don't want to know anything about it.
It's bad enough just thinking about you and them Apaches all the time.
I had to go back to them.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You liked living with savages?
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.
Lots of white women have been grabbed by Indians.
Any decent one would have killed herself before she let 'em turn her into a squaw.
- I'm not that decent, I guess.
- Don't shout. They'll hear you.
You don't care what happens to me.
Only what people think about you.
- I do business with them people.
- The people who treat your wife like dirt.
I was better off with the Indians.
- Maybe that's where you belong.
- I don't belong here any more.
Maybe you don't.
At a trot, ho!
- Keep in line there.
- At a gallop, ho!
- Back into line.
- Left about, ho!
- No!
- Get back into one line, damn it.
- Gather round that flag.
- Sergeant Ferguson.
That was the worst exhibition...
I know, but most of these horses aren't saddle-broke.
Half your men don't know one end of a horse from the other.
Come on now, move it into line.
- Lieutenant?
- What is it, Corporal?
- Jess Remsberg is in town, sir.
- Jess?
- How does he look?
- He still ain't over it.
- Where is he?
- The saloon, sir.
- Harrington, lend the sergeant a hand.
- Yes, sir.
You keep those men polishing the seats of their pants until they can do that turn.
- We leave for Concho in two days.
- All right, we're going to try it once more.
Forward at a gallop, ho!
Whisky.
Lieutenant?
I've got a wagonload of goods for Fort Concho.
I'd appreciate it if I could tag along with your troop.
No.
I've got a right to army protection.
If I take you along, you do. But I'm not.
My, you sure do look pretty in that new uniform.
- Lieutenant...
- Grange.
This trip's going to be rough enough without dragging along extra freight.
Sorry.
I hear you found Ellen
Grange on the way.
Her husband didn't seem too anxious to get her back.
- Tom Van scouting for you?
- Aye.
I sent him to Mexico to check how many more warriors have joined Chata's force.
I found him 60 miles south, where I picked up Mrs Grange.
I'd say he was two days dying, Apache-style.
Then Chata's already across the border, slaughtering anyone they've run across.
Not without reason, Scotty.
The Apaches were holed up on that hellhole reservation at San Carlos.
- Tricked, lied to, murdered...
- It cuts both ways, Jess.
Bad enough when a man like
Tom Van ends the way he did.
When you find women and children dead like that...
- I've got to tell Major Novac about Van.
- Wait a minute.
You sent me a message. I'm here.
Aye.
That's a pretty nice scalp you got there, mister.
I know where an Indian scalp like that would bring a pretty good price.
How much you want for it?
- What was that?
- He was going to kill you, Toller.
All I did was ask what he wanted for the Indian scalp.
This Indian was his wife.
- What happened?
- I hit you.
It's a good thing you did.
Where is it, Scotty?
- Where'd you get it?
- Fort Concho.
From the town marshal.
New man. Clay Dean.
Clay Dean?
Aye. Killer for hire, wearing a badge. You know the type.
Thanks, Scotty.
- Dean may not be the man.
- If he's not, he'll tell me.
The man who caught my wife alone is going to pay, and not just by dying.
Stop it! Apaches take revenge that way. No civilised man...
That was no Apache that scalped my wife.
That was one of your civilised men!
We're heading for Fort Concho in a couple of days. I want you to come along.
You just want to be with me when I catch this man Dean.
You figure I'll let him die quick and easy if you're there.
With Tom Van gone, I need a scout.
No.
I've two wagonloads of ammunition and 25 green troopers.
Colonel Foster needs them in Fort Concho.
What are you bucking for?
I can't afford any mistakes on my record.
I'm going to be a general some day.
I don't remember you being so damned ambitious.
I'm getting married when I get to Concho.
Sergeant Neabamer's daughter.
She'll give you hell if I don't get there.
I guess a week or so won't make any difference.
We ought to bury that, Jess.
After I find the man that took it off her.
Tell the major he'll have to wait. I got some unfinished business to take care of.
McAllister said you wanted to kill me.
I don't much like that idea.
I'd rather get it over with now if the thought's still in your mind.
It's not.
- Are you quite sure?
- I said so.
Then I apologise.
I'm sorry, I didn't know.
I know you didn't.
- Let her go.
- Like hell. She tried to steal our horses.
She ought to be put in jail.
We won't let her go till she's nice to us, like she was to those Apaches.
She shouldn't mind us after pleasuring Chata's son.
I said let her go.
Sure.
I didn't lay a finger on you. I was just going to tell her husband.
- You won't tell her husband anything.
- All right, I won't. I swear.
I like changing odds. Two to one seemed more of an even bet.
So you saved me again, Mr Remsberg.
This time you saved my honour.
Only now you know there is none left to save.
- You sound like I ought to apologise.
- I didn't ask you to bring me back here.
If the Apaches had taken you captive...
At least they didn't spit when I walked past.
- People here treat me like a...
- I know.
I had a Comanche wife.
Well, that's different.
No one thinks it wrong for a man. As long as he leaves her behind when he goes.
I said she was my wife.
I know how they look at you.
I know how they treat you.
One of them finally killed my wife.
Come on. Better get you home.
I can understand why you'd want to run away.
But there's something you ought to think about.
If you go back to Chata's band, his son Nachee'll most likely kill you for running away from him.
I didn't run away. I was taken away, unconscious.
Our brave soldiers hit the Apache camp while the men were out hunting.
The trooper who gave me this almost killed me before he saw my blonde hair.
- If I were your husband...
- You are not my husband.
They all think any decent woman would rather die than live as an Apache squaw.
- Maybe they're right.
- Death comes soon enough.
Anybody that hurries it is a damn fool.
What I was trying to say is... what's over is done.
You two could go someplace where nobody knows what happened to you.
My husband would know.
Thanks, Major.
- I appreciate your cooperation.
- It's my pleasure, Mr Grange.
Have a seat, Sergeant.
If that was a hint you want me back in the army, no thanks.
Toller, Chata may have already started north across the border.
You know what that means.
Well, as far as my re-enlisting is concerned, no chance, Major.
The army owes me for 40 horses I spent the last four months hunting and breaking.
I'm planning on investing my stakes in a gambling saloon.
No more army for me, Major.
Sir, Grange claims you've allowed him to accompany me to Fort Concho.
The army has to cooperate with traders.
He's been most helpful to us.
Yes, sir. But with all-green troopers and only two days before we head out...
You don't have those two days. You'll be starting for Fort Concho at dawn.
Sir, I need time to whip those raw recruits into some kind of shape.
And half Toller's horses aren't saddle-broke.
Then he will have to finish breaking them on the way to Fort Concho.
Hold it. My contract calls for delivery of fresh mounts and I've delivered them.
Your contract calls for delivery of saddle-broke horses.
It ain't my fault he's got to move out early.
- If I could have one more day...
- You have your orders.
- Yes, sir.
- Not with me he don't.
Sir.
You can have your money for the 20 broken mustangs.
But to get paid for the rest, you'll have to go with McAllister.
For every horse you break in on the way,
Colonel Foster will pay you in Concho.
The men I hired to help catch those mustangs are gone.
The clothes I lived in for four months I burned.
And I didn't buy this new outfit to eat no trail dust in. This is a swindle.
- Be careful, Toller.
- You shut up, McAllister.
You don't scare me none.
- And you sure can't pull no rank on me.
- Toller, I'm sorry.
- But that's the way it will have to be.
- Hurry it up, Toller.
You might manage to break another horse or two before dawn.
You enjoy seeing me on a horn, don't you, McAllister?
You were a pretty good sergeant once.
But to me you're just another money-hungry civilian.
You used to be a pretty good sergeant yourself.
But now you're just a... a rank officer.
I'll be back, Major.
Company, attention!
Line up in columns of two.
Dress right on the flag.
Open her up.
Whoa!
- Grange?
- Yeah.
You might not be able to get any kind of an escort back here for weeks.
So?
It might not be too good an idea leaving your wife here alone all that time.
What makes it your business? Hm?
It makes no difference. She stole two horses and disappeared again last night.
- Did you report it?
- No, why should I?
They could have sent somebody after her.
If she wants to go, she can go.
Straight to hell, for all I care.
Sergeant, mount up.
Prepare to mount.
Mount!
Scotty, I'll be riding out on my own.
I'll pick you up in a couple of days.
Remember, you're no use to me hung up like Tom Van.
Yes, Mother. I'll need a spare horse in case I have to make some time.
- Toller!
- I want a receipt.
Drop that gauntlet, trooper.
Pull yourself up, lad.
Look proud, all of you.
- Move 'em out, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.
Lead off to the left, a column of twos.
Forward, ho!
- Sergeant, present arms.
- Company, present arms.
It is your doing Nachee is dead.
White-eyed trappers took him alive.
They beat him to death with a whip.
- I didn't want him dead.
- You white-eyes want us all dead.
But when I die it will not be as tame reservation Indian.
I will die Apache, killing my enemies.
Alchise!
Kaeta? Where is Kaeta?
Kaeta.
The boy is your son. You can care for him while you live.
Nachee's body lies in
Mogollon Mountains.
You will live until we come there.
- You're going to kill me?
- No.
You will be alive when I bury you in the grave of my son.
Hold it!
Come on!
Sir, there's a rider coming in from the south.
Rub him down while he's feeding.
- You've been pushing hard.
- I didn't want to come in after dark.
One of your rookies might have mistaken me for an Apache. Thank you.
- Got anything for me?
- I got a good look at Chata.
- You stretch your luck pretty thin.
- He's got about 45 armed men.
He's on the move, his whole camp. Women and kids.
Including your wife, Grange.
- Where's Chata headed?
- Mogollon Range'd be my hunch.
He's got to set up a permanent camp before he can put on any war paint.
- If we could catch him by surprise...
- Scotty, he's got almost 50 fighting men.
You got 29 including me, Toller and Grange.
We could hold Chata in place long enough for reinforcements to arrive from Concho.
Just hold on a minute, Lieutenant.
- You ain't aiming to tangle with Chata?
- If you're going to eavesdrop, keep quiet.
I put out a lot of money for that wagon.
I want to get it to Concho.
If you're so anxious to get to Concho, just hoist your butt on that wagon and go.
What do you think I am, crazy?
Corporal Harrington.
- Are you busting with things to say, too?
- I don't like it either.
But you're the cock-a-doodle-doo here, so I'm stuck.
Then?
I just finished busting you another gut-twister. Mark it.
Yes, sir?
You'll carry a dispatch to
Colonel Foster at Fort Concho.
And don't stop on the way.
- Not to eat, not to sleep. Understand?
- Yes, sir.
Pick him out the two fastest mounts we've got.
And in future, when I'm having a private conversation, keep the hell away from me.
Like right now.
Jess, get a meal under your belt, then ride out and keep track of Chata.
That'll leave you without a scout.
Chata could find you before I find him.
I'll take care of myself.
You take care of yourself.
There's a man in Concho I gotta see before I die.
- Grange.
- Yeah?
If we should tangle with Chata... he'll have to leave his families unguarded.
There's a chance we could get to your wife and get her out.
Well, she's where she wants to be.
So let her be.
Mrs Grange! Ellen Grange!
Mrs Grange!
What the...?
Get your pencil ready.
- Are horses all you worry about?
- Yeah.
I got ten more to bust then my worries are over.
- You could still lose your skin out here.
- Not if I can help it.
Sir. There's fresh pony tracks leading across our trail into that canyon.
Well, soldier boy, you found your Apaches.
- Do we proceed, sir?
- We'll advance at the ready.
Yes, sir.
Toller. You remember the Ojo Caliente fight.
You got an arrow in your backside and I pulled you to cover.
- I remember.
- I have to lead the column.
And somebody's got to find out if Chata's up there.
- And if I get killed you'll know.
- That's right.
I see.
Hold your fire. Reform in twos.
Come on. You ain't paid for yet.
Get those wagons to the rocks.
Form a company front behind the wagons. And do that about-turn.
- Let's get you mounted.
- Leave me be.
Don't give me no orders,
McAllister. Come on.
O'Brien, company front behind the wagons.
About turn!
Fire!
About turn!
Your leg's broke.
I know.
Sir, there's 16 dead. Some more men are hurt so bad they can't be of much use.
- And the cookwagon's lost.
- I know, Sergeant.
- All our grub.
- The water. I know, Sergeant!
- Chata's got us pinned down.
- As long as he keeps us pinned down till Colonel Foster shows up, it'll have been worth it.
- Won't it, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
Tell the men that the water they've got in their canteen will have to last them until the reinforcements arrive.
Any man who uses his up will just have to drink his own sweat.
- Yes, sir.
- And, Sergeant.
- Fine job for your first Apache fight.
- Thank you, sir.
Well, find shade for the wounded and see that everything's done that can be done.
Yes, sir.
The worst casualty is that cookwagon.
Chata dealt the cards, played us and took the first hand cold.
I've still got an ace card up my sleeve.
- Harrington?
- Aye.
Don't look. Look the other way.
It's Corporal Harrington.
Let's go.
That's where Scotty is. We gotta get to those rocks before Chata can cut us off.
When I give you the word, get going full out. I'll take the boy.
You both got a better chance of making it if I take him.
What are you doing?
Chata won't risk his men shooting his own grandson.
Now.
Lieutenant. Look.
Prepare to fire!
Fire!
Gimme here. You're scaring the kid.
Gee-gee-gee-gee-gee.
Whoo!
You're standing up now.
Yes, you're standing up.
What did you bring that here for?
"That" is her son.
Oh.
Sorry, ma'am, I didn't mean to...
Scotty, Harrington didn't make it.
He was tortured before he died and probably told Chata everything he knew.
So Chata knows I'm waiting here for reinforcements that won't arrive.
He also knows what's in those wagons.
He wants that ammunition. And the glory.
And he gets both by wiping us out.
Which makes him bigger than ever with the Apaches.
Jess.
We've got to break out and find water.
Where?
There's only two places between here and Concho.
One of them's where Chata left his families, 20 miles inside those hills.
With those wagons you'll never outrun him.
- And the other place?
- Diablo Canyon.
Just a half a mile from where Chata's sitting.
But Diablo is a box canyon.
There's only one way in.
I spotted four or five Apaches there.
That's all he'll need to hold you up.
Well, what's next... General?
- How old is he, ma'am?
- Four months.
He don't favour his mother, that's for sure.
Is that yours?
- Yes.
- You didn't tell me that...
- Why?
- After the way you acted?
So you ran off the first chance you got to get back to this... half-breed bastard.
- Come off it, Grange.
- You stay out of this.
- That's just a little baby.
- You keep your mouth shut!
You were saying?
Pick it up.
- Be careful, Grange.
- I told you to pick it up.
You got another one in your holster.
Use that one. Or backwater.
You two can play games some other time.
Right now we can't spare either of you.
You ought to play poker,
Grange. You got natural luck.
Lieutenant McAllister would like to see you two.
Look. We set out at dark with the wagons for Concho.
Chata's not likely to follow us till he's sure we're not feinting him out of the canyon.
He'll just scout us, knowing he can catch us easy enough when he's ready.
After a couple of hours, we'll shift direction.
Strike straight for where he's left his families.
The scouts will race back to report it.
Chata will have to come out to stop us.
But by then, I'll have changed direction again.
Circling back to Diablo Canyon.
Getting there before Chata realises what's happened.
You might make general one day.
Except he'll probably leave some men in the entrance to that canyon. Just in case.
That's something you'll have to take care of before you set out for Concho.
You and the four best men I've got left.
- Toller?
- He's not under my orders.
But I'm thirsty, too.
And I'm getting thirstier.
Troopers, mount up.
We're moving out.
Dress on the wagons.
It's time now, Mrs Grange.
- Help me mount.
- Are you sure you're able?
- Sergeant, I give the orders.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
Jess.
As far as I'm concerned, the job's done when you report to Concho.
Clay Dean's there.
I'll not take it bad if you don't return with Colonel Foster.
- Scotty.
- Aye?
Keep an eye on Ellen
Grange and her boy.
You've got no luck, Jess.
She's already married.
Welcome to your gory bed - or to victory.
Been over two hours. McAllister must have made his first move by now.
Now we start straight for the hills. And Chata's families.
It's a scout reporting back to Chata.
- How many?
- I couldn't count.
They couldn't have left too many behind.
Turn back to the canyon. We've got to get there by dawn.
Now!
It's almost dawn.
If we keep on like this, these animals will die.
We'll all be dead if we don't.
Move those wagons faster.
Forward!
Bugler, sound the charge.
Make way for the wagons.
Bugler, sound the charge.
Swenson, sound the charge.
Welcome to the water hole, General.
- Where's Jess? Is he all right?
- He's on his way to Concho.
Get the survivors back to the water hole. Start with Mrs Grange.
And Mrs Grange... you stay there.
Did Jess get away?
Yes, except two of Chata's outriders followed him and got some shots at him.
- Sergeant Ferguson.
- Yes, sir.
Get the men lined up for inspection. Tell
Major Novac we're heading for Concho.
- We only got just 11 men left.
- Get him back to the water hole.
Guard the entrance to the canyon with...
With...
And position the two best marksmen we've got left on top of the mesa.
Try and get snipers up there.
Mr Toller, I understand you fought through a few of these Indian campaigns.
- A few.
- Look, I'm a damn good sergeant, see?
But I never fought no Indians before.
I never even been west of St Louis till
I brought out this bunch of recruits.
Get those horses back to the water. They earned it.
And get one ammo wagon all the way back to the water so we can use it for a last stand.
Maybe we can hold out until
Colonel Foster gets here.
- Suppose Remsberg gets caught.
- Remsberg ain't Harrington.
I don't much like the idea of blowing up all this ammunition.
Let's hope we don't have to.
Casey! Nyles!
Let's get you inside so you can watch this whole rim up here.
If I was Chata I'd call it quits.
Anybody see where that come from?
Scatter. We're too exposed.
They're out of ammunition.
Chata's taking no chances. A stray bullet would hit that ammunition wagon.
The lieutenant seems to be resting easier.
Fever's down. He'll be all right.
You must love that kid an awful lot to do what you did.
He's my child.
I wish... that I'd taken it different.
I want you to know that, Ellen, because we're not going to get out of here.
Maybe if...
Maybe if we'd had a kid, things would have been different.
You were a good husband, Will.
Before the Apaches took me.
But you never would have been again.
Well...
You'll need this when they get in here at us.
There's two cartridges in it.
- Toller.
- Sergeant.
- Sir. They're getting ready for something.
- Let's have a look.
My wagon.
They're using it for cover. Sergeant!
Hold your fire until you see something to shoot at.
Fire!
Hold your fire until you can see the legs of those ponies.
Get ready to fire.
Now.
Casey, Nyles, cover us.
We're coming back.
One got back inside here.
Get going.
Grange, get going.
Get down.
- Did you finish that big meal already?
- Colonel, is Clay Dean in town?
The marshal? I suppose so.
Unless he's off celebrating.
He killed a man last night.
- We'll be ready to pull out in five minutes.
- I'll catch up with you.
- Mount up.
- Prepare to mount.
- We have to move back further.
- They'll all be slipping back in here now.
We're pulling back. Get moving.
Hold it.
- Anybody seen Grange?
- Grange?
Grange!
Grange!
Grange!
Who's that?
Jess Remsberg.
Who the hell is Jess Remsberg?
Scout for Colonel Foster's fort.
All right.
What do you want?
- You Clay Dean?
- Yeah.
I need some information.
- It's important.
- Better be important to me.
Well?
Where'd you get that?
- I won it in a poker game.
- Who did you win it from?
- Why?
- Who?
First you tell me why you want to know.
- She was my wife.
- Oh.
So that's it, huh? No, you're not going to find out about him from me.
I might tell him about you, though.
He did you a favour, mister.
I ain't got nothing against a man bedding down with a pretty young Indian girl.
- But calling her your wife...
- Tell me who you won it from.
You can leave here now, squaw man.
And leave your gunbelt.
Take off the gun.
Or use it.
Now tell me who you won her hair from.
- If I do?
- If you do, you go on living.
You got yourself a name as a bad man with a gun.
Maybe you're thinking you can tell me any name and later come gunning for me.
No, I...
Well, now you know.
You're not fast any more.
You give me the wrong name and
I'll come back and finish the job.
Now, who?
He needed $10 to see my hand.
Grange put up the scalp for it.
He was drunk and...
- Who did you say?
- Grange. A freighter. Will Grange.
He was telling how he'd revenged his wife on this Comanche girl he'd caught.
They're inside the perimeter.
Get against the walls.
- Get back.
- He's alive.
Will!
- They're killing him.
- Not yet.
It's an old trick.
They saved him for this.
To work on our nerves.
Oh, God.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death.
Ferguson, it is time to collect that dry brush and get it under that ammo wagon.
If they rush us, that wagon better burn fast.
Mrs Grange.
Somebody's got to kill him. Put an end to what they're doing.
Mrs Grange...
Give me your gun and get down.
No.
All up to you now, Toller. Don't let them get the ammunition.
Chata won't get that ammunition.
Even if he wipes us out.
And he's lost too many men against a force half his size.
- You did it.
- No.
- I killed most of my men.
- Chata had to be stopped and you did it.
That's what the army's out here to do, ain't it?
Is it?
Yes.
Yes.
Toller.
You...
You tell them that...
- You're sure this is what you want to do?
- I don't want him to die.
- Chata will take care of him.
- He'll raise him as an Apache.
My people would never raise him as one of their own.
They're getting ready for the kill.
We'd better get back to that wagon.
Now, Mrs Grange.
Mrs Grange, now.
They're coming. All of them.
If they get me, you fire this wagon.
Company, halt.
Ellen!
- Ellen.
- Let me go to Will.
- Where is he?
- Let me go to him, please.
You stay here. I'll find him.
Kill me.
Help. Please.
Please. Kill me.
Now. Please. Kill me.
Help.
I wonder if they'll stay on the reservation this time.
Why should they?
Company, forward. Turn, ho!
Forward, ho!
General.
